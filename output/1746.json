    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 6TH\nMARCH, 2020 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (2020)\nAn 18th Century lesbian romance everyone must see\nB\nefore I get into\nthis review,\nI\u2019d like to first\nsay I can do\nnothing but respect C\u00e9line\nSciamma\u2019s feminism that\nshe so unmistakeably\ndisplays in both her filmmaking and life. Here I\nam of course referencing\nher, along with the rest of\nthe crew\u2019s, walkout of the\nC\u00e9sar Awards ceremony\nafter (convicted paedo-phile) Roman Polanski\u2019s\nwin. It is refreshing to\nsee people within the film\nindustry refuse to be com-plicit as they so often are.\nI know this had nothing to\ndo with the film, but for\nme it added some more\nauthenticity to the story\nand characters and was\nan important moment for\nfilm.\nPortrait of a Lady on\nFire is an 18th century\nperiod piece telling the\nstory of Marianne, a\nyoung artist hired to\npaint a wedding portrait\nof H\u00e9lo\u00efse, an aristocrat\nset to be married off to a\nman in Milan against her\nwill. The film begins with\na student asking Marianne\nabout a painting of hers;\nthis invokes a clear\nemotional response in\nMarianne and she tells her\nstudent the painting, titled\n\u2018Portrait de la jeune fille\nen feu\u2019, was made many\nyears ago. We then take\na dive into Marianne\u2019s\nmemories and flashback\nto her sailing to an isolated\nisland in Brittany. Once\nthere, she is informed\nthat H\u00e9lo\u00efse is defiant;\nshe does not want to be\nmarried and hence refuses\nto sit for her portrait.\nInstead, Marianne must\npretend she has been hired\nas a walking companion\nfor her. She spends her\ndays stealing glances at\nher subject\u2019s features and\nher nights painting them\nfrom memory.\nHaving only just\nreturned from the\nconvent, we see H\u00e9lo\u00efse\nenjoy her first spell of\nfreedom in her lifetime.\nThese happy scenes of\nher swimming for the first\ntime and enjoying music\nthat Marianne plays for\nher, amongst many others,\nare accompanied with a\nfeeling of melancholy,\nas it will also be her last\nbefore her wedding. She\nknows this, too. This is\nparticularly thought-pro\u201cThe film is\nquite slow and\nisn\u2019t very thick\nwith plot, yet\nmanages to\npack a punch\u201d\n\u201cDespite being\nset over only\ntwo weeks,\nthe once in a\nlifetime love\nbetween the\ncharacters\nwas totally\nbelievable\u201d\nvoking when in response\nto Marianne suggesting\nthere will be good times in\nMilan, H\u00e9lo\u00efse essentially\nsays that it doesn\u2019t matter\nwhen she does not have the\nfreedom of choice \u2013 these\nthings will just be there to\n\u2018console\u2019 her. There are\nvarious moments like this\nscattered throughout the\nfilm that more explicitly\ndisplay director and writer\nSciamma\u2019s point, but\noverall, there are overar-ching themes of women\nin love, friendships in art,\nas well as women\u2019s liber-ation, that are quietly displayed in each and every\nscene. Even though these\nthemes are in the context\nof the 18th century, they\nare still resonant in society\ntoday. It is noteworthy\nthat there was not a single\nmale character in this\nentire film and hence we\nwere all spared of having\na male view imposed on\nany of these characters.\nSpending each day with\none another, an inevitable\nbond is formed. There\nis a pivotal moment in\nthe film in which Marianne\u2019s true purpose on\nthe island is revealed and\nrather than being angry,\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse agrees to pose for\nher. From this moment\nforward, their intimacy\nand attraction towards\neach other blossom and\na romance between the\ntwo women begins. One\nof the things I loved most\nabout this romance was\nthe balance between the\ncouple. Neither had more\npower over the other,\nwhich is what you may\nexpect between artist\nand model. This theme\nwas touched upon in\none scene where H\u00e9lo\u00efse\ntells Marianne she does\nnot hate being watched\nby the painter, as this\nentire time she has been\nobserving Marianne too.\nThe portrait becomes a\ncollaborative piece of\nwork, however, being the\n1700\u2019s, we (audience and\ncharacters alike) were all\naware that the faster it approaches completion, the\nsooner this relationship\nbetween the two women\nmust end. Watching this,\nyou are devastated for\nthem. Because of this, I\nwas completely expecting\nthe ending to be sad, but\npersonally I found it surprisingly happy; though\nthe final scene is certainly\npoignant enough to be\nmoved to tears.\nThe film is quite slow\nand isn\u2019t very thick with\nplot, yet manages to pack\na punch. This is heavily\ndue to the cinematography employed through-out. We don\u2019t explicitly\nneed dialogue or scenes\nof intimacy between the\ncharacters to realise that\nthey have fallen in love,\ninstead we have clever\ncamerawork that depicts\nthe way they gaze at one\nanother - full of love\nand desire. The use of\nlighting and framing is\nperfect throughout. And\nif you\u2019re someone like\nme who has an eye for all\nthings pretty, you can do\nnothing but appreciate the\nvideography and visuals\nof cinematographer Claire\nMathon. The colour\npalette and landscapes\nused in Portrait of a Lady\non Fire were gorgeous.\nThe two actresses\nleading this film, No\u00e9mie\nMerlant (Marianne) and\nAd\u00e8le Haenel (H\u00e9lo\u00efse)\nplayed their parts ex-ceptionally. I realised\nwalking out of the cinema\nthat the film was only set\nover a couple of weeks\nand yet the perhaps once\nin a lifetime love between\nthese two characters\nwas totally believable.\nI believe this is mostly\ndue to the two actresses,\nwho both melted into\ntheir roles and each other.\nAlso, whilst there were no\nexplicit sex scenes in the\nfilm, it was still sensual\nand there was enough onscreen chemistry between\nthe pair that you felt the\npassion just from their\nlooks and body language.\nFrom writing to acting,\ndirection to costume\ndesign, cinematography to\nediting, I would describe\nthis film as perfect. I\ncannot believe it wasn\u2019t\nnominated for an Oscar. It\nis a beautiful and genuine\nromance expressed in the\nmost picturesque way, and\nI was truly moved whilst\nwatching it. As a testament to how good the film\nis, upon watching Portrait\nof a Lady on Fire, I have\ndecided I must go back\nand watch everything\nC\u00e9line Sciamma has\nworked on and everything\nshe will work on in the\nfuture.\nNo\u00e9mie Merlant and Ad\u00e8le Haenel embracing on the beach // Lilies Films\nFILM\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\nDir: C\u00e9line Sciamma.\nScript: C\u00e9line Sciamma.\nStarring: No\u00e9mie Merlant,\nAd\u00e8le Haenel\nLanguage: French\n120 minutes\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY\nON FIRE\n\n"

There were many\nvery valid points raised\nabout how the space and\natmosphere are not quite\n\ufb01t for purpose, what\npostgrads and staff would\nlike from the space (both\nin terms of food, furniture\nand events) and where we\ngo moving forward. Part\nof this conversation did\nfocus on the food offering,\nand how we can work\ntogether to provide the\nbest service. As there are\nnow conversations about\nthe bigger picture and long\nterm future of h-bar, the\nequipment that needed to\nbe purchased was put on\nhold inde\ufb01nitely, awaiting\nprogress updates.\nFelix: How is the 568\nreopening going, and\ndo we have financial\ndata on the effect of\nthe closure?\nFH: It\u2019s going well! After\na few blips at the start\n(mostly running-out-of-cheese related), we are\nback in full swing, and\nalways looking for potential to improve. Of course,\nthe kitchens being closed\nfor 2.5 months has had a\nsigni\ufb01cant impact on our\n\ufb01nances, in the region of\n\u00a340k loss on dry alone,\nbut we know this also had\nan impact on the wet sales\nand student experience\ntoo, which affects the\n\ufb01nances on the day and\nloss of regular custom\nrespectively.\nFelix: What has been\nhappening with the\nblock grant negotia-tions?\nFH: The senior managers\nat the Union are working\nthrough Department\nOperating plans to ensure\nthat all teams work as\neffectively and ef\ufb01ciently\nas possible. This not only\nhelps us de\ufb01ne what is\ncorefortheUnion,butalso\nshows that we have a plan\nfor a successful year, and\nthe Block Grant should\nsupport x,y,z activities to\nachieve this. These plans\nare being pulled together\nin order for the Finance\n& Risk committee and\nBoard of Trustees to have\noversight before \ufb01nalising\nthe proposal for College.\nFelix: Could you\nspeak a bit about the\nServices & Sustainability Board and\nGreening Imperial?\nFH: The Services &\nSustainability Board are\ncurrently going through\na review for how the\ncommittee should be run,\nand have already had a\nmeeting around what currently doesn\u2019t quite work\nand what may work better.\nWe had a plan to run a\nsustainability campaign\nthroughout February, but\nthe demands on an already\nhighly-engaged group of\nstudents was evidently too\nmuch, and it was deemed\nreasonable to reassess\nhow we move forward.\nIt is the \ufb01rst year this\ncommittee has existed,\nand so I am not surprised\nthat it is not \ufb02awless \ufb01rst\ntime around. I am excited\nabout the amount of potential it holds, and know\nit can do a lot of good\nfor students, the Union\nand Imperial overall, and\nI hope that I can reform\nthe foundations to solidly\nsupport this growth.\nFelix: Have you figured out a better way\nto deal with contracts\nyet as spoken about\npreviously?\nFH: The eActivities route\n(to have an un-editable\nformat with pre-written\nclauses from me that a\nCSP can pick and choose\nfrom) is a working\nprogress. I am looking\nto do a bigger role of the\nDPFS role to remove\nadmin, as this is a massive\ntime drain that doesn\u2019t\nallow whomever is in post\nto work on larger projects\nand achieve more on their\nmanifesto, and contracts\nmay fall under that, but\nit is very much a \u201cwatch\nthis space!\u201d project at the\nmoment!\nFelix: Do you have\nany other general\ncomments, such\nas on other things\nyou\u2019ve been working\non, or just anything\nyou want to talk\nabout?\nFH: The Summer Ball\nCommittee selected the\nHoosiers in the later half\nof \ufb01rst term 2019. We had\nalready agreed to move\nfrom a DJ (as we have\nalways had in the past) to\na live performance from a\nwell known and popular\nartist. We felt that the\nHoosiers were an amazing\n\ufb01t, with songs that lots\nof students will instantly\nrecognise, and could put\non an excellent show!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know.\nIf you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

I thought, however,\nthat might undermine the\nmessage. A pity, for sure.\nThis year, International\nWomen\u2019s Day falls on a\nSunday \u2013 which is awfully\ninconvenient for us trying\nto provide coverage, as\nwe publish on a Friday.\nI decided to split the\nconversation over this\nissue and the next. I\u2019ve\nwritten this editorial this\nweek, and next week we\nwill feature an extensive\nThrowback section.\nThat section will\nfeature a fascinating range\nof stories on women at\nImperial, that we discovered in the Felix archives\nduring the Union\u2019s Diving\ninto Imperial\u2019s HerStory\nevent, which we hosted\ndown in the office this\npast Monday. Credit goes\nto Yani up at the Union\nfor putting that together,\nand to Jia Qi Tan, one of\nour Books and TV editors\n- two women who put a\ngood deal of effort into\nrecognising the women in\nour community.\nOn the back of that, I\nwas inspired to write a\nlittle tribute to the women\nin my life here.\nFirstly, a bit of the\nhistory of IWD: it truly is\nan international story. The\nMarch 8th date was originally proposed in 1910 by\nClara Zetkin, a German\nrevolutionary (according\nto Wikipedia), who was\ninspired by a Women\u2019s\nDay in New York by the\nSocialist Part of America\nin 1909. The first to pick\nit up as a national holiday\nwas, unsurprisingly given\nits origin, Soviet Russia in\n1917 \u2013 and this adoption\nactually was driven by a\ncity-wide demonstration\nby women textile workers\nin Petrograd, which constituted a major moment\nin the overall Russian\nRevolution.\nIWD remained predominantly a communist\nholiday until 1967, when\nit was picked up by\nsecond-wave feminists\n\u2013 returning to its roots as\na catalyst for activism. Although in the modern day,\nit has been corporatised\nto an extent, suffering the\nsame fate as many other\nsocial causes under the\ncurrent commercialised\nclimate, it remains a powerful symbol for change.\nWeirdly, reading up\nabout all this, I was reminded of several of the\nwomen in my life: namely\nmy mother, as well as her\nmother and her sister \u2013 my\ngrandmother and aunt.\nThey are each matriarchs\nof their zones, staunch\nfeminists, and shaped me\nimmensely growing up.\nThey each also lived in\nmany countries, experiencing truly international\nlives \u2013 and in particular\nones that threw into sharp\nrelief the varied experiences of women around\nthe globe.\nIn particular, the stories\nmy mother and aunt have\nof living in Saudi Arabia\nas children are fascinat-ing, and I think helped to\nshape their perspective on\nwomen\u2019s rights at a young\nage.\nI love my family, but I\ndon\u2019t want this to be about\nsentimentality, or to turn\nit into being about me and\nmyrelationshipwiththem.\nSo forgive me for glossing\nover that part. Suffice to\nsay that I think are the\nperfect representatives of\nwhat feminism should be.\nSelf-assured, confident\nwomen who have each\nachieved very highly and\nattuned much wisdom in\ntheir lives, and who raised\nme and my brother to be\nfeminists by empathy and\nunderstanding rather than\nby doctrine.\nMy grandmother on\nmy father\u2019s side has,\nwithout delving into her\nor my personal life too\nmuch, taught me much\nabout both generosity\nand strength in life \u2013 and\nall the varied forms this\ncan take, outside of the\nmale-dominated one we\nare constantly presented\nwith via every form of\nmedia and social conditioning one could imagine.\nOf course, as I grew\nolder, other women\nentered my life \u2013 in par-ticular, my partner.\nWell, what can I say\nwithout making it all\nabout me, and without\ngetting all sentimental.\nShe\u2019s awesome; strength\nand kindness, independence and the act of sharing\na life with another, and\nshe's all the feelings that\ncome with that incarnate.\nShe\u2019d kick ass with or\nwithout me in her life, so\nI\u2019m just happy to be along\nfor the ride. She\u2019s what\nthe modern world allows\nwomen to be \u2013 and what\nwe should keep fighting to\nensure the next generation\ncan be.\nIn writing this, I\u2019ve\nfound that it can be\ndifficult to talk about\nwhat makes each of these\npeople paragons of all the\npositive aspects of womanhood without referring\nto myself and my relationship with them. I thought\nI\u2019d add a little addendum\nto this article discussing\nthis.\nI feel like this is a trap\nthat many men in this\nscenario \u2013 or, indeed,\npeople in general in other\nscenarios \u2013 fall into. We\nare all locked within the\nsilos of our own minds,\nand it can be hard to think\nabout others outside of the\nconfining boundaries of\nour own experiences with\nthem.\nBut doing that inherently diminishes one\u2019s point,\nsometimes. It doesn\u2019t make\na person kind to be nice to\nyou specifically, and if one\nthinks about everything in\nthose terms it is very easy\nto miss the point. Empathy\nbreeds understanding,\nand you can\u2019t empathise\nby bringing the women in\nyour life into your world.\nYou have to step into theirs\nto understand them, their\nissues, their perspectives,\nand their lives.\nI have no foolproof\nmethod for achieving this.\nIt\u2019s a universal problem\nthat, in many ways, we all\nlive and die alone, inside\nour own minds. At the risk\nof sounding like a moron,\nthat\u2019s why \u2018The Matrix\u2019\nworks as a concept. But\nit\u2019s something to remember and strive for.\nCentrefold 1, 3 // Taja Strle\nFront Cover // Joseph\nO'Connell-Danes, edit by Taja\nStrle\nCentrefold 2 // Matt Shun\nF\n\n"

They would\nsay you are trying to get\nsomething out of us\u201d. A\ndifferent behaviour with\nrespect to the two realities is shown also by the\nauthorities. On this note,\nProf. Carroll told me an\ninteresting anecdote: \u201cIf\nyou go to Macau today,\nyou can see a small body\nof water that divides\nMacau from Zhuhai. I\nonce asked a government\nof\ufb01cial: don\u2019t you worry\nabout people swimming\nover to escape? He said:\nwhy do they need to\nswim? They can just walk\nover. It doesn\u2019t really\nmatter\u201d.\nHong Kong people, on\nthe other hand, are very\nworried about immigration and the arrival of an\noverwhelming number of\nindividuals with pro-Bei-jing views.\nThe protests\nAnother interesting\nquestion to address, due\nto its potential devel-opments, is that of the\nrecent protests in HK, the\nUmbrella Movement of\n2014 and those sparked by\nthe proposed Extradition\nBill of last year.\nWhile the 2014 protests\nlasted for around two\nmonths before evaporat-ing, without obtaining any\nof the democratic reforms\nthey sought, the 2019 ones\nlasted much longer. They\ncontinued indeed until the\nCoronavirus emergency\nhit the city. Prof. Carroll\nopinion is that once this\nexceptional situation will\nbe over, the protests will\nactually resume, due to\nseveral reasons.\nFirstly, unlike the\nUmbrella Movement,\nthese protests have been\ncharacterised by extremely harsh \ufb01ghts between\nthe protesters and the\npolice. The disproportionate violence exercised\nby the police force was\nworse than even that of\nthe 1967 protests, and\nfor that reason he thinks\nthat the police have never\nbeen hated as much as\nthey are as now. This\nattitude towards the police\nand exacerbation of the\nrepression was also mentioned by Lord Patten in\nhis lecture last February.\nSecondly, this emer-gency, although momentarily halting protests, has\nincreased the dissatisfaction of Hong Kong people\ntowards the government.\nPeople think indeed that\nthe borders with China\nhave been closed too late,\nfacilitating the spread\nof the virus, and that the\ngovernment did not act\nsuf\ufb01ciently to limit the\n\u201cHis opinion is that once this\nexceptional epidemic situation\nis over, the protests will\nresume\u201d\nprice of face masks and\nother goods now deemed\nimportant. To the question\nof whether Beijing will\nstill have faith in Carrie\nLam as Chief Executive\nof Hong Kong, Prof.\nCarroll replied that there\nis no way to know. The\ninternal matters of the\nChinese Communist Party\nare secret to the extent that\nwe don\u2019t even know how\nmany times Mrs Lam goes\nto mainland China. Right\nnow, Hong Kong people\ndon\u2019t want to renounce\ntheir desire of a more\ndemocratic system, while\non the other side Beijing\ndoesn\u2019t want to give in to\nthem, therefore a way in\nwhich the situation could\nbe resolved is not foresee-able.\nPersonal experiences\nAs my interlocutor was\nborn in the 60s in Hong\nKong and was brought up\nthere, I thought it would\nbe noteworthy to ask him\nabout his relationship\nwith the place. He told me\nthat, although he had been\ninvited to the handover\nHong Kong Umbrella Movement in 2014 // Flickr\nceremony, he could not\nattend because he was\nin the United States for\npersonal reasons. He\nnonetheless watched it\non TV and found it quite\nemotional, and that while\nit was the ultimate concre-tisation of decolonisation,\nit was not perceived so at\nthe time.\nLooking back,\nhowever, he believes\nHong Kong\u2019s decolo-nisation has been the\nmost successful to have\noccurred. This is because\nit was planned 13 years\nahead and occurred in an\na very smooth fashion,\nmaintaining for instance\ntheir same laissez-faire\neconomical system. The\nopposite scenario took\nplace in India, where de-colonisation was pushed\nthrough in the summer of\n1947 and was followed by\nan unstable international\nsituation in that region\nof Asia. Furthermore,\npeople who worked for\nthe British began simply\nto work for the Chinese,\nwithout accusations of\ncollaboration which led\nto summary executions as\nin other colonies. Nobody\ncould accuse anybody\nelse of that, because they\nall worked for the same\npeople.\nConcerning the recent\nprotests, I asked him\nwhether he felt worried\nthat some of his students\ncould have been there,\nrisking their lives. He\nreplied that he was indeed\nworried, even if the\nstudents of his faculty\nwere not as involved in the\nprotests as those of other\nfaculties, e.g. Law. While\nnow, because of corona-virus, lecturers can only\nteach online, he is worried\nabout what will happen\nwhen the normal schedule\nresumes. This political\nsituation would indeed\nsee a further polarisation\nin the universities, where\nstudents may be involved\nin the protests on one\nhand, and on the other the\nmainland community may\nface discrimination by HK\nstudents. The important\nthing, Prof. Carroll states,\nis to guarantee a safe environment for all students\nindependent of their background and that academic\nfreedom remains as vital\nas it is today..\nSome reflections\nHaving been given this\nwonderful insight into\nthe issue I consider as\nAsia\u2019s most singular and\ninteresting city, I was only\nencouraged to further\nexplore its history and all\nits faces. What is most\nshocking is that in Hong\nKong almost every year\nan era seems to have come\nto an end, and another\nseems about to begin. One\noccurred in 1997 with\nthe handover, one seems\nto happen each time a\ncycle of protest begins,\none will probably take\nplace in 2047, when Hong\nKong\u2019s status as a Special\nAdministrative Region\nwill expire.

    "content": "ISSUE 1746\nFELIX\n11\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClearly satan in disguise, with an EU halo // Wikimedia\nefficient if it was not a\nslave to marketable trends\n(selfie stick, iPhone 10,\niPhone 10 S, iPhone 10\nSS, iPhone 10 SSHH\u2026)\nand elitism that only a few\ncan afford but directed\ntowards the real necessities of the people. What\ngrowth really refers to is\ngrowth of contamination\nrates, growth of inequal-ity, growth of precarious\njobs, growth of the market\nagainst the environment\nand against the people.\nThis is the point where\nAlberto and I differ, he\nbelieves growth and\necologism are compatible,\nwhat is more, he seems to\ndeclare them best friends,\nso he would probably not\nagree with my previous\nrant about \u201cgrowth\u201d. But\nlet us talk about degrowth.\nDegrowth does not\nmean a decrease in the\nquality of life or that\nyou will have to live\nin dark green forests;\nthat is just the picture\npainted by, again, the\nusual suspects. Degrowth\nis a set of policies and\nmeasures directed\ntowards the achievement of a society where\ncontamination degrows,\ninequality degrows and\nthe importance of the\nomnipresent market\ndegrows. Degrowth is\n(not paradoxically) also\nabout growth: growth\nof green jobs, growth\nof public services and\nproperty, growth of civil\nparticipation and decision\nmaking, growth of small\nbusiness, growth of biodiversity\u2026 This is precisely\nthe system change I was\ntalking about, one that\nputs people first and, like\nparents with their kids,\ntells big business when\nthey are crossing the line.\nSo, I think Alberto should\nhave at least mentioned\nhow degrowth \u201ctakes\naway: teachers, hospi-tals, doctors and even\nfreedom\u201d, as it seems to\nme to be quite the opposite\ncase. I recommend Naomi\nKlein\u2019s \u201cThis Changes\nEverything\u201d for a well-re-searched (better written)\nintroduction to many\ntopics regarding capital-ism, ecologism and green\nAfter telling us about\nhis affinity for rats, misidentifying the arguments\nof the \u201cGreta cult\u201d and\nstating that degrowth is the\ndevil in disguise , Alberto\nclaims that the only\nalternative to ecologists\u2019\nmiserable and apocalyptic\nsolution to our miserable\nand apocalyptic future\nis the same capitalism\n(i.e. our miserable and\nsoon to be apocalyptic\npresent) that precisely\nled us to this situation. To\nback this bold claim, he\npresents the example of\nthe river Thames, which\nhe argues is at its most\nbiodiverse for centuries!\nThis is true, it was even\ndeclared biologically dead\nin 1957 and biodiversity\nhas improved since the\nindustrial revolution, but\nsaying that it is thanks to\nour friend capitalism is a\nbit of a stretch. The end\non the British Empire\nmeant a huge decrease\nof usage of the river and\nthe displacement of heavy\nindustry from London\nto the periphery helped\na lot. About companies\ncleaning the river because\nit is in their interest, as\nfar as research has led\nme this was because\nof stricter changes in\nthe legislation, not the\ncompany\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d\nnature. Regardless, we\nshould not be thanking\na company for cleaning,\neven voluntarily, what\nthey dirty (at least I do not\nthank my dirty flatmate\nfor cleaning his shit). He\nalso mentions how this is\na solution found within\nthe capitalist framework,\nit is true as well, and it\nmatches very well with\ndegrowth\u2019s legislation\nover companies. Maybe,\nAlberto, you agree with\nthe \u201cGreta cult\u201d more than\nyou think! Being more\nrigorous now, one cannot\npresent a Thames example\nas a \u201cproof\u201d that capitalism eco-rocks, when\ncapitalism is, as I have\nalready said, the cause of\nthe climate crisis (maybe\nyou would like to argue\nagainst that too). Regarding democracy, I believe\nno Greta is threatening\ndemocracy, but rather\ntrying to make our current\nliberal democracies more\nparticipative and closer to\nthe people, so I cannot see\nhow democracy is antagonistic to ecologism and\ndegrowth. What I can see\nis how ecologism challenges political systems\nthat do not represent their\npeople, in who sovereignty lies, and how that can\nbe an issue for the usual\nsuspects; but that is not\nsurprising.\nLastly, I wanted to\ntalk about a figure that I\nhave noticed has emerged\nparallel to the far right\nglobally, that of the \u201cpolitically incorrect knight\u201d.\nReading Alberto\u2019s article\nmade me think more\nabout this idea, so I will\nuse it to exemplify the\nconcept. Opposite to the\nwell-known online \u201cwhite\nknight\u201d who fights for\nprogressive causes such\nas (especially) feminism,\nLGTB+ movement, ecologism\u2026 in a saviour-like\nmanner, the \u201cpolitically\nincorrect knights\u201d are\nthose individuals who\nfight against these\nprogressive ideas in a\nrather insulting, direct\nor merciless way, hence\nthe politically incorrect.\nThis role comes from the\nthreat perceived by some\nsectors of society in progressive ideas becoming\nhegemonic in our culture.\nIn order to attack them\nwithout looking reactionary or archaic, they\nraise in their discourse\nthese progressive ideas\nto hegemonic (when they\nare far from it), widely\naccepted or politically\ncorrect so that they can\nthen charge against them\nas a revolutionary act\nagainst the establishment.\nIn the case of this article,\nAlberto identified ecolo-gism as hegemonic, even\nsaying that most parties\nhave made it its number\none priority. This is far\nfrom true and not even\nleft parties pay nearly\nenough importance to\necologism, the priority for\nparties remains numbers\nthat say something about\nthe sacred economy (or\nBrexit in the case of the\nUK). The title of his\narticle also illuminates\nthe revolutionary aspect\nof the act (yes I know it is\nalso a pun), as he presents\nhis text as one daring to\nstand up against Greta\nthe eco-dictator, stealing\nthe girl her dreams in\nhis last paragraph. Well,\nAlberto, I will not be the\none to steal your dreams,\nbut I can assure you that\nnot even you, or a few fat\ncompanies will be able\nto steal our dream for a\nbetter society.\n\u201cDegrowth is\n[...] directed\ntowards the\nachievement\nof a society\nwhere\ncontamination\ndegrows,\ninequality\ndegrows and\nimportance\nof the market\ndegrows \u201d\nalternative approaches to\nneoliberalism in our time.\n\n"

    "content": "Riot has Revealed Further Details of \u2018Project A\u2019 \u2013\nValorant \u2013 Including Release Date!\nDuring Riot Games\u2019 10 Year Anniversary broadcast, they shocked the gaming sphere by announcing a litany of\nnew games under development \u2013 and one might be coming sooner than we thought\nGAMES\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\n\u2019m a massive League\nof Legends nerd,\nand so was extraordinarily excited\nwhen Riot revealed a\nmyriad of games during\ntheir 10th anniversary\nbroadcast a few months\nback \u2013 splurging two\nwhole pages of fanboyism\ninto this Games section as\na result. So, imagine the\nparoxysms of joy I fell\ninto when they revealed\nthis week that the previously mysterious \u2018Project\nA\u2019 would be coming this\nsummer already.\nWith a newly-revealed\ntitle, Valorant looks to be\nan exciting addition to\na genre of games which\noften seems over-saturat-ed: first person shooters.\nThey are perhaps the\nmost popular format for\ntriple-A gaming releases,\ndue to their high-octane\naction, relatively intuitive\ncontrol schemes, ease of\nexecution on both console\nand PC, and \u2013 above all \u2013\ntheir variety in tone from\nultra-competitive esports\ntitles to single-player\ncasual experiences.\nFrom the information\nrevealed this week,\nValorant seems to lean\ntowards the former. Riot\nhas taken strong cues from\nbothCounterstrike:Global\nOffensive (CS:GO) \u2013 the\noldschool tactical shooter\nthat maintains one of the\nworld\u2019s biggest esports\nscenes \u2013 and from Overwatch (OW), the 2017\nhero-shooter title which,\ndespite recent fall-offs and\nglaring mistakes made by\ndevelopers Blizzard, was\nstill hugely impactful on\nthe industry as a whole.\nThey seem to be pri-oritising the tight-knit,\nhigh-precision gunplay of\nCS:GO in terms of core\ngameplay, stressing over\nand over that a clean,\ncompetitive style was\ntheir focus. Although the\nplayer does pick a \u2018hero\u2019\ncharacter with abilities\n\u2013 each distinct from one\nanother \u2013 abilities (as\nwell as weapons) have\nto be \u2018bought\u2019 with an\neconomy system, similarly to CS:GO\u2019s economy\nmechanics. So while\non a surface level the\nhero-shooter element is\nmore reminiscent of OW,\nthe mechanics of how it\nworks \u2013 the way they\u2019ve\nexecuted the concept \u2013\nstill leans closer to CS:GO\nin this regard. The abilities\n\u201cRiot has taken\nstrong cues\nfrom CS:GO,\nprioritising\ntight-knit\nhigh-precision\ngunplay\u201d\nthemselves are relatively\nlow-power, more similar\nto buying equipment such\nas smoke grenades than to\nthe flashy and explosive\nults that define OW or\nLoL.\nThis also reflects in\nthe big industry names\nthey\u2019ve been consulting\nwith \u2013 rumours are\nabound that high-profile\nstreamers and esports pros\nfrom the shooter scene,\nsuch as Shroud, have been\ninvited to Riot\u2019s studios\nfor feedback sessions.\nThey\u2019ve taken other\nlessons from their success\nwith LoL, however,\nincluding the importance\nof resource-unintensive\ndesign \u2013 in other words,\nyou can run this game on\na freaking toaster. Where\ntheir experience developing the world\u2019s most\npopular competitive game\nreally shines, however,\nis in their dedication to\nbehind-the-scenes devel-opment.\nAs you can tell from\nthe above, Valorant\u2019s core\ngameplay cycles are not\nhighly original. It\u2019s easy\nto draw comparisons to\nother games, meaning it\nfits neatly into a unique\nniche that nonetheless is\nsandwiched by industry\ngiants. What is truly\nexceptional is this behind-the-scenes stuff. So let\u2019s\ndive into what separates\nValorant from its stiff\ncompetition.\nFor starters, it will run\non a 128-tickrate server.\nIn simple terms, that\nmeans the server speaks to\nyour computer 128 times a\nsecond. This is double that\nof its closest competitors,\nCS: GO and Rainbow Six:\nSiege (RSS), and up to six\ntimes that of other games\nsuch as Apex Legends.\nIt\u2019s clear why this is\nbeneficial to any gamer\n\u2013 the more regularly information is being shared\nbetween different players\u2019\ncomputers and the server,\nthe less \u2018lag\u2019 there will be\nbetween different inputs\nand outputs (such as you,\nor an enemy, shooting at\nand killing eachother.)\nOf course, this is\nexpensive to run. You\nflat-out need more and\nbetter servers to handle it.\nLucky, then, that Riot is \u2013\nand I quote some random\non Reddit \u2013 \u201crich af\u201d from\ndeveloping and peddling\nLoL for a solid decade.\nAnother piggyback\nfrom their LoL experience\nis that Valorant will also\nuse the internet infrastructure set up by Riot for\ntheir LoL servers. Without\ndelving into detail, Riot\nhas cut lots of deals with\nISPs to prioritise their\ninternet traffic, ensuring\nlower ping for players.\nPing describes the\nlength of time it takes a\npacket of information to\nget from your computer\nto the server and back.\nThe higher your ping,\nthe laggier the game.\nReducing it, then, is\nessential to competitive\nintegrity.\nThis also has a huge\naffect on \u2018peeker\u2019s advantage\u2019\u2013 and I reference you\nto PC Gamer\u2019s \u201cRiot is\non a crusade to eradicate\n\u2018peeker\u2019s advantage\u2019 in its\nnew FPS Valorant\u201d article\nhere to get a good explanation of how that works.\nIn short, due to the lag in\ninformation between your\ncomputer, which transfers\nto the server, which then\ntransfers to an opposing\nplayer\u2019s computer, often\nthe first player to move\ninto the line of sight\nof another has a strong\nadvantage over that other\nplayer. This has been a\nnightmare for shooter\nplayers for years.\nThat aforementioned\nterm \u2013 \u2018competitive integrity\u2019 - really seems to\nbe Riot\u2019s ultimate priority\nhere, and is the basis on\nwhich they hope to steal\nmarket share from competitors which have historically been plagued by\ndodgy servers\u2026 or, more\nnefariously, by h4x0rz.\nHax. Hacks.\nThis is where things\nget really sweet. Riot\nhave designed their own\nanti-cheat systems right\ninto the code of the game.\nI\u2019ll borrow an example\nfrom a PC Gamer article\nI referenced while writing\nthis up:\nWallhacks \u2013 where\nplayers trick the game\ninto letting them see\nthrough walls and thus\nknowing where everyone\non the map is at all times\n\u2013 have been targeted by\nimplementing a \u2018fog of\nwar\u2019 system, which is\nanother borrow from\nLoL. In that game, you\ncan\u2019t see enemies until\nthey\u2019re a certain distance\nfrom you or a friendly\nunit. While that isn\u2019t the\ncase in Valorant \u2013 don\u2019t\nworry, you can still camp\nsniper alley \u2013 what they\nhave done is make it so\nthe server doesn\u2019t even\ntell your computer where\nenemies are until just\nbefore they\u2019re visible\nto you. Even if you can\nsee through walls, it\nwon\u2019t help, because your\ncomputer won\u2019t know\nwhere anyone is.\nSick stuff.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and\nsee whether just having a\nfairer, more competitive\ngame will be enough to\ndistinguish Valorant from\nits rivals \u2013 rivals which\nare deeply established\nin the gaming industry\nand community. The\ngameplay itself, I fear,\nwill not be unique enough\n\u2013 but despite that, I\u2019m\nkeen to try it out in just a\nfew months.\nValorant drops this Summer, a CS:GO + OW hybrid with better netcode // Riot Games\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 6TH\nMARCH, 2020\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\n\n"

    "content": "Uncut Gems (2020)\nI\nf you haven\u2019t seen it\nadvertised by Netflix\nalready, Uncut Gems\nstars Adam Sandler\nas New York jewelry\ndealer, Howard Ratner,\nin-debt to just about every\nman in the Manhattan\ndiamond district. It\u2019s the\nfifth feature film of the\nquickly rising Safdie\nbrothers, compromised of\nJosh and Benny, with their\nmost recent work gaining\npraise from critics and\naudiences alike; Uncut\nGems no exception to the\nrule.\nHaving only seen their\nprior film, Good Time\n(2017), I had some idea\nwhat I was getting myself\nin for with this; a fast-paced, tense and gritty\ndrama centered around\none character. Although\nthis was true, I was still\nnot prepared for the sheer\nrelentless pace and tension\nthis film created.\nIt is by no means\nexaggeration when I say\nthat this film gave me\nnear heart palpitations.\nThe way the film follows\nSandler through every\ndecision he makes shows\nus the full extent to how\ndownward his life is\nspiraling. He gets by from\nencounter to encounter,\njust about keeping afloat,\nand his sheer character\nalone is what keeps him\nfrom self-combusting\nat any moment. This\nexpertly crafted script\nfrom the duo was at the\nvery forefront of this film,\nwith Sandler\u2019s performance only elevating the\nwords on the paper to the\nscreen.\nThe way that the Safdie\nbrothers put you right in\nthe middle of the con-frontations, the clubs, the\nshouting, the arguments;\nit comes as such a release\nwhen we\u2019re treated to\nanything other than pure\nrestlessness, and you\nforget what it is to live\nnormally. The constant\nhigh octane, uncompromising show simply\nis Howard\u2019s life, and\nnothing seems to go right\nfor him. But then it does.\nAnd now he throws it\naway. This is the constant\ncycle that Howard creates,\nand it is just bonkers to\nwatch. Never before have\nI rooted for a character\nso much, yet completely\nquestioned every decision\nhe made.\nThe continually\nmounting tension left\nme wanting Howard to\njust get a break more\nthan anything, and the\nend of the film provided\nthis for me. Something\nfinally goes right for\nhim. The boot that the\nSafdie brothers have been\npressing into my temple\nis finally lifted, and as\nthe film ends, you\u2019re\nleft wondering how 160\nminutes have just passed.\nIf you\u2019re complaining\nthat there are no good\nfilms on Netflix, and\nyou\u2019re yet to watch Uncut\nGems, look no further\nfor a way to spend your\nevening.\nWould You Rather There Was An Advert Here?\nT\nhere probably\nwould have been\nan advert here.\nWe don\u2019t have\nanother article this week,\nand we\u2019d normally just\nput \u2018Felix is recruiting!\u2019 at\nthe bottom.\nIt would look really\nstrange if it was just\nblank. It could have been\nblank, or if I change a\nletter, black. Like a cut\nto black. Like a cut to\nblack by Bergman. I\u2019m\nwriting in 11pt Times\nNew Roman, he wrote in\n104pt Florida. Sometimes\nhe wrote in EF Windsor.\nBut Windsor was wistfully whisked away by\nWoody. (Allen of course).\nIt\u2019s very recognisable.\nYou\u2019d definitely know it\nif you saw it; it\u2019s that sort\nof flowery posh font that\u2019s\nin all his films. I quite like\nit. I would show you what\nit looked like here, but I\ndon\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed\nto change the font. That\u2019s\nFelix\u2019s fastidious font fiat.\nIs the font consistency\nthrough films a requirement to be an auteur?\nWes and his Futura that he\nborrowed from Kubrick.\nVery recognisable. It looks\nnice but who really cares\nif it\u2019s the same. Godard\ndanced about in Helvetica\nand Univers, Tarkovsky in\nPump. They\u2019re just f**ing\nfonts.\nBong Joon-ho\u2019s got\neveryone talking; he\u2019s\nvery deserving of the\npraise really. Parasite was\na great film. It didn\u2019t grate\non me at all. I can\u2019t lie and\nsay I\u2019ve been a fan of his\nfor years, I mean I\u2019d only\nseen Okja, but I\u2019ve heard\nhe\u2019s very good. I\u2019ve even\nread it.\nHe met Oscar a few\nweeks ago and everyone\nwas surprised. Everyone\nloved that their meet-ingwas unexpected, and\neveryone was so quick\nto congratulate him. \u2018A\nlandmark in cinema\u2019, the\nfirst foreign film to win\nthe Best Picture Oscar.\nWhat mark has it left? Are\nwe going to have more\nandn more foreign films\nstreaming through the\nmain media. It would be\nnice if that were the case.\nPeople like good films.\nPeople like films that\nother people say are good.\nReviews mean a lot more\nnow than they did a few\nyears ago. Their score on\nRotten Tomatoes, their\nrating on Metacritic. This\nfilm is 100% rotten. That\nsounds like an excellent\nfilm. I\u2019ll write to Fellini\ntelling him that 8\u00bd was\n98% rotten. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d\nlike that, to know just how\nrotten his film was.\nIf a film is 20% rotten\nit\u2019s a bad film. I know\nbecause other people have\ntold me. I don\u2019t need to\nwatch this film because\nI know that it is only\n20% rotten, it\u2019s only 44\non Metacritic. We\u2019re all\nguilty of it, looking at the\nreviews and making up\nour minds already.\nMaybe we should make\na secret pact to all go see\na film and give it terrible\nreviews. We\u2019ll say it\u2019s 0%\nrotten and 22 on Metacritic. Then no one else will\ngo and see it. We\u2019ll have\nour own little film that\nwe all know is amazing,\nbut people say oh that\u2019s\na terrible film, and we\u2019ll\nagree.\nI wonder if reviews\nhave that cascade effect.\nIf people start saying that\nsomething\u2019s really good\nand everybody agrees.\nThey give it good reviews\nand it amplifies and\ngrows. Now everyone is\nsaying it\u2019s a great film, but\nreally it was just a good\nfilm. Those fools. They\ncan\u2019t tell the difference\nbetween a good film and a\ngreat film. I can\u2019t tell the\ndifference either.\nHave you read the\nbook? No, but I\u2019ve\nwatched the film. That\u2019s\nnot the same. Why\u2019s it\nnot? The book has more\ndetail and it\u2019s more enjoy-able. That\u2019s a good point.\nWhich of the two took\nmore time though. Did\nit take longer to write\nthe book or make the\nfilm. I mean all of it. The\nscript, the production,\nthe editing. If you added\nup all the hours of all the\npeople involved with the\nfilm would it be longer\nthan the book? So which\nis more impressive, the\nbook or the film. Depends\non the book, I guess.\nSomeone told me\nnaming directors makes\nme more qualified to\nwrite for the film section.\nFrom Bertolucci to Bong\nJoon-ho, now to Fellini\nand Tarantino, Terrence\nMallick work your\nmagic, here\u2019s Jacques\nDemy and Tarkovsky,\nthere goes Varda working\nharder, than Godard the\navant-garde, Kurosawa\nhad great power, while\nBuster Keaton never\nbeaten, I could list\nanother name but in the\nend they\u2019re all the f**ing\nsame.\nOr would you rather\nthere was an advert here?\nFILM\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nA diamond Ferby is the height of fashion // A24\nISSUE 1746\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFILM\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nDir: Josh Safdie, Benny\nSafdie Script: Josh Safdie,\nBenny Safdie Starring:\nAdam Sandler, Kevin\nGarnett, Julia Fox, LaKeith\nStanfield. 160 minutes\nUNCUT GEMS\n\n"

Her find\nadds both a possible\n\u2018Goldilocks\u2019 candidate\nto the current \u2018exoplanet\u2019\ncatalogue, and one that\nclaims the title of the 16th\nsmallest on that 4126-long\nlist.\nCapitalising on data\ngathered by NASA\u2019s\nKeplar missions, which\nexplore the universe,\nsearching for planets\noutside of our solar\nsystem, Kunimoto\nanalysed information\nspanning almost 200,000\nstars. She used the transit\nmethod to identify these\nexoplanets, a technique\nwhich monitors light\npatterns around stars to\ndetermine if they are\ninterrupted by an orbiting\nbody, such as a planetary\ncandidate.\n\u201cEvery time a planet\npasses in front of a star,\nit blocks a portion of that\nstar\u2019s light and causes a\ntemporary decrease in the\nstar\u2019s brightness,\u201d said\nKunimoto, who studies at\nthe University of British\nColumbia in Canada. \u201cBy\nfinding these dips, known\nas transits, you can start\nto piece together information about the planet, such\nas its size and how long it\ntakes to orbit.\u201d\nThe transit discovery\nmethod is one of several\nthat can be used to\nidentify planets \u2013 and it\nis one of the most fruitful,\nwith over 3,100 exoplanets confirmed using this\napproach alone. The next\nbountiful approach, the\nradial velocity method,\ncan only claim around\n700 exoplanets, watching\ninstead for a change in the\nstarlight wavelength that\norbiting planets cause.\nHowever, Kunimoto\ntook a different approach\nto previous Kepler\nanalyses. \u201cMy search\nlooked for planets with\nslightly lower signal-to-noise-ratios - weaker\nindications of planets\n- than the Kepler team\nand many previous independent searches.\u201d Unlike\nthe Kepler analysis,\nKunimoto applied a\nBox-Least Squares (BLS)\nalgorithm to the Kepler\ndata with an associated\nsignal-to-noise (S/N)\nratio to sift the significant\nresults from background\nnoise, rather than Kepler\u2019s\nwavelength-based algorithm with its Multiple\nEvent Statistics (MES)\ndetection method. The\nBLS algorithm allowed\nher to lower the noise\nfloor, set at an S/N value\nof > 6 compared with\nthe Kepler MES ratio of\n7.1. \u201cThis improved my\npipeline\u2019s sensitivity to\ncandidates that are both\nsmall and have long\norbital periods.\u201d\nAnd it paid off with\nthe discovery of KIC11350118c, which\nmeasures in at just slightly\nbigger than Mars and is\none of the smallest to be\nidentified \u2013 the sixteenth\nsmallest identified from\nthe Kepler data so far. But\nit wasn\u2019t as easy as all that\nsounds; Kunimoto\u2019s initial\nanalysis found 130,312\nsignals that met the S/N\ncriteria, which needed to\nbe whittled down to those\nfinal 17 planets, by subjecting them to a barrage\nof vetting procedures,\ndigital and manual, to\ndiscard the false positives.\nKunimoto also teamed\nup with a UBC alumni,\nHenry Ngo, to use\nNear InfraRed imaging\ncaptured by the Gemini\nNorth telescope in Hawaii\non the stars of interest.\nBy taking high-resolution\nadaptive optics images of\nthe stars, Kunimoto had\nthe resolution to differentiate between clusters\nof stars and individual\nlight sources, something\nthe Kepler data, taken\nwith a lower resolution\ntelescope, could not do.\nThis allowed her to rule\nout false positive transit\nsignals, like those from\neclipsing binary stars\n\u2013 a set of two stars that\nappear, at low resolution,\nas a single point of light,\nbut can eclipse each other\nand mistakenly be read as\na transit signal like that of\nan orbiting planet.\nSomething of a veteran\nplanet hunter, Kunimoto\nhas already notched up\nfour planet discoveries in\nher undergraduate days.\nBringing her total up to\n21, the findings, recently\npublished in The Astronomical Journal, identify\n17 new exoplanets \u2013 and\none of particular interest.\nCatchily named KIC7340288b, it joins the\nhandful of exoplanets\ndiscovered to date that\ntick the vital \u2018Goldilocks\u2019\nboxes; like Earth, based\non its radius, it\u2019s likely\nrocky instead of gaseous\n(like the gas giant Jupiter),\nand also sits within the\nhabitable zone of its star,\nmeaning temperatures\nthat could allow liquid\nwater at the surface. As\nKunimoto describes it,\n\u201cthis is a really exciting\nfind, since there have only\nbeen 15 small, confirmed\nplanets in the habitable\nzone found in Kepler data\nso far.\u201d\nAbout 1.5 times the\nsize of Earth, KIC7340288b sits 0.444\nastronomical units from\nits star (about the distance\nof Mercury from the Sun)\nand completes an orbit in\njust 142.5 Earth days. The\nlargest of these 17 new exoplanets is eight times the\nsize of the earth, while at\nthe other end of the scale,\nfive measure up smaller\nthan Earth, rounding up\nwith KIC-11350118c as\nthe smallest.\nThe Kepler mission\nwas started primarily to\nidentify more of these\nGoldilocks planets.\nKunimoto and her PhD\nsupervisor hope to\ncontinue using Kunimoto\u2019s approach to re-an-alyse the Kepler census\nof current exoplanets,\nadding a much-needed\nlayer of confirmation. In\nthe future, however, they\nwant to start drilling into\nthe data for more than just\nconfirmation purposes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be estimating\nhow many planets are\nexpected for stars with\ndifferent temperatures.\nA particularly important\nresult will be finding a\nterrestrial habitable zone\nplanet occurrence rate.\u201d,\nexplains Professor Jaymie\nMatthews, Kunimoto\u2019s\nPhD supervisor. \u201cHow\nmany Earth-like planets\nare there?\u201d\nWith data like that,\nNASA can optimize\nfuture space surveying\nprojects, and, importantly,\nplan a more targeted\nmission to gather data on a\nhabitable zone exoplanet.\nAs Kepler gathered data\non very distant stars, once\nthe occurrence rate for a\nhabitable zone planet is\nknown, NASA can judge\nthe likelihood of finding\none in a much nearer\nlocation \u2013 and plan for\nthat rather than a mission\nto a planet thousands of\nlight years away.\nWith findings like\nthese, that mission might\nnot be all that far, far\naway after all.\nThe 17 newly discovered planets, with Mars, Earth, and Neptune included for scale.\nThe green planet is the habitable zone planet KIC-7340288b. // Michelle Kunimoto\n\n"

The goal of the\narticle seemed to be to\n\u201cdestroy\u201d what the author\nbelieves to be the ideas\nmost ecologists support\nwith facts and logic. After\nreading it I was somewhat\nconfused, as what he\nwas writing against does\nnot really represent the\nmovement and barely\nany reasoned arguments\nagainst ecologism were\nprovided. In this article I\nwill show how Alberto\u2019s\nidea of climate activists\nis mistaken, what some\nof our (my) real ideas are,\nsuperficially dispute the\neco-neoliberal fairy-tale\n(for the nth time) and\ntalk about the reactionary\nfigure of the \u201cpolitically\nincorrect knight\u201d in our\ntimes.\nAt the beginning of\nthe article, the author\nstates in some way that\nhe is concerned with the\nenvironment. To do this\nhe highlights his love\nfor numerous animals,\nflowers and all those sorts\nof things that do just one\nthing: infantilise and trivi-alise the ecological cause.\nBy associating climate\nactivists like Greta with\npeople who, for some\nreason, really like nature\nyou are equating it to a\nhobby. Would someone\ndare compare our sacred\neconomy with coin col-lecting? No. So I would\nsuggest that if the author\nwants to be taken (not\nsaying that he is not)\nas someone concerned\nby the climate crisis\n(yes, crisis, not change),\nhe could at avoid this\nunnecessary trivialising\nremark. Again, being\necologically concious is\nnot about having a passion\nfor the wonders of mother\nearth, but to see that if we\nkeep going like we are,\nwe are all fucked; and I\ncannot think of something\nmore critical to his own\nconcerns.\nAfter this self-recog-nition as a nature lover\n(which is more than I can\nassert), Alberto proceeds\nto present to us what he\nbelieves the \u201cGreta cult\u201d\n(what many reactionaries\nwould probably call\necologists these days)\nmean by ecologism.\nCentral to this insulting\ncaricature is the idea of\noverpopulation and what\nhe calls \u201cmass suicide\u201d\n(plausible if Seneca was\na top selling author).\nAlberto\u2019s incorrect claim\nthat this is something\nmost ecologists advocate\nis precisely a bastard\nidea of the neoliberalism\nhe so much loves and\nsocial Malthusian ideas\n(that the Nazis so happily\ninherited). Capitalism has\nfor decades imposed an\nindividualist conception\nof ecological conscience\nbased on blaming each of\nus for our lack of \u201cgreen\u201d\nbehaviour in our day to\nday life. Yes, that is right,\nyou, who uses plastic\nstraws, are as responsible\nas Shell for the climate\ncrisis. Once accepted this\npersonal responsibility,\nit is (not so) reasonable\nto jump, as Alberto does,\nto population control\nand genocide, which, as\nI mentioned are usually\nestablishment to avoid\nthe masses from realising\nthat a hundred companies\nare responsible for 70% of\nthe contamination of the\nplanet, and genocide is\njust an alternative measure\nthat punishes (kills!) the\npowerless instead of the\npowerful.\nAfter the above consid-erations, you can probably\nunderstand why I was\nconfused when I read that\nI am \u201cobviously the heir\nof those who wanted to\nsterilise populations\u201d. A\nmovement that challenges\na threat to the survival\nof humans cannot argue\nfor their extermination!\nMaybe the author has yet\nto realise that the climate\ncrisis does not only kill\ncute animals like the\ndolphins and elephants he\ncites, but also humans, especially the destitute. It is,\nindeed, the \u201cthird\u201d world\n(it exists!) that is suffering\nthe most the consequences\nof the wrongdoing of the\nusual suspects. This is the\nreason why movements\nlike Extinction Rebellion\nput emphasis in showing\nthe ecological issues that\nthese countries experience and the West cannot\nbe bothered with (unless\nit is to despoil them or\nenslave them) . We, or at\nleast I, argue is that it is a\nfew companies in the (un)\ndeveloped Western world,\nsupported by the political\nclass and the privileges of\nthe (un)free market that\nare responsible for our\ncurrent crisis. Note that\nthis is a shift from the\nindividualist eco-shaming\ninvented by neoliberalism\nto a structural critique of\nthe system, one that most\nof us can adhere to. Once\nthis different critique\nhas been established, we\nof \u201cgrowth\u201d, and we all\nknow that \u201cgrowth\u201d is\ngood, or do we? According to Alberto, the closest\nsynonym of economic\ngrowth would be technological progress. I am\nslightly sceptical of this,\nthe neoliberal world is not\nknown for putting technological progress first,\nbut profit maximalization\n(or so my Mathematics\nof Economics module\nsuggests). This is a point\nthat is sometimes difficult\nto come to terms with:\ntechnological progress\nis only a by-product of\ncompanies\u2019 goal to make\ncash, and therefore,\nsubjected and obstructed\nby it. The development\nof technology would be\nbetter focused and more\nThe environmental movement is more profound than a hobby for those who\u201creally\nlike nature\u201d // Wikimedia\n\u201cHe highlights\nhis love for\nnumerous\nanimals,\nflowers ... that\ninfantilise\nand trivialise\nthe ecological\ncause\u201d\ncould jump, like Alberto\ndid, to the different conclusion that we should\ndestroy these few companies or even destroy\nthe system, instead of\ndestroying every human.\nThis is again a caricature\nthat so many economy\nlovers love to criticise.\nBut the truth is we are not\neven asking for a system\ndestruction (the wettest of\nmy anti capitalist dreams),\nbut for a system change.\nThe other main idea\nAlberto seems to assign\nto the \u201cGreta cult\u201d is\n\u201cdegrowth\u201d. The term\nitself is curious enough,\nas like anything that\nchallenges the sacred cow\nthat is the economy, it had\nto be coined in a negative\nfashion as the antagonism\npresent in reactionary\nfar right sectors, as the\nideal way of ending with\neach of us eco-sinners.\nIndividual eco-shame is\nyet another effort by the\n\n"

It follows the fifteen-year-old Cio-Cio San\n(Natalya Romaniw) who\ngets leased to marry the\nAmerican naval officer\nPinkerton (Dimitri Pittas).\nThe first of the three\nacts is by far the weakest,\nas the plot is cluttered\nwith explanations and\nset-ups, only to mildly pay\noff with a romantic scene\nnear the end of the act.\nThe sentiment is there,\nbut its heart gets lost in\nthe translation, making it\ndrag. The remaining two\nacts, thanks to a major revelation and a flash forward\nin time, are superb. They\nare as beautiful as they\nare gut-wrenching, in\nno small part thanks to\nRomaniw, who soars as\nCio-Cio San, demonstrating a masterclass in\nsinging and emoting.\nApart from Romaniw\u2019s\nperformance, it is the\nlighting that elevates\nMadam Butterfly. The\nbright pastel colour\nscheme is absolutely\nperfect. The lighting\ncolour scheme evolves\nwith the changing mood\nof the play, adding yet\nanother layer of depth\nto the production. There\nis also some puppetry\nthroughout the show,\nwhich is definitely\nadorable, but in no way\ninnovative or irreplacea-ble.\nMadam Butterfly\nis a show about love,\ndevotion, betrayal and\ndesperation. But make no\nmistake, it is also deeply\npolitical, touching on\ntopics such as East versus\nWest and the American\nDream. At times this is\ndone through words, but\nat other times, it is simply\nthrough the integration of\npan-Asian motifs as well\nas direct references to the\nStar-Spangled Banner,\nwhile firmly staying\nrooted in its classical\nstyle.\nOverall, although cluttered with exposition at\nfirst, Madam Butterfly is\ndeeply engaging, lending\nitself to a rich and satisfying climax and conclu-sion, both musically and\nstory-wise. It is a timeless\npiece with universal\nthemes, and it is clear how\nit has had a direct influence on the 20th century\nmusicals. In fact, various\nmusical motifs used are\nreminiscent of some of\nthe more tender moments\nin Les Miserables, which\ncame around 81 years\nafter Madam Butterfly.\nHowever, regardless of\nhow amazing the cast may\nbe, I can\u2019t bring myself\nto believe that there were\nno suitable Asian opera\nperformers who could do\njust as good a job, not\nonly as the lead role, but\nalso various supporting\nroles. Given the number\nof diverse roles that have\nbeen stolen from the\nBAME community over\ncenturies, I can\u2019t quite get\npast this overlook in this\nday and age.\nICSM Drama Presents: TRAP\nD\nuring my time\nat Imperial,\nbecoming a\npart of ICSM\nDrama has been one of\nthe greatest joys of my\nuniversity life. Unfortunately, for the last couple of years, I haven\u2019t\nbeen able to be nearly\nas involved as I would\nhave liked to be, be-cause, you know, life\ngot in the way.\nRegardless of my par-ticipation, over the years\nI have witnessed ICSM\nDrama greatly diversify\ntheir repertoire. Gone are\nthe days of staging classics\nlikeAMidsummer Night\u2019s\nDream and The Crucible\n(both of which were fantastic productions, having\nproduced the latter one\nmyself). ICSM Drama\nhas opted for surrealist\ninterpretations of Lorca\u2019s\nBlood Wedding last year,\nand most recently, a\ndocumentary-style supernatural thriller in the form\nof TRAP.\nTRAP takes place in a\ntown where all audience\nand cast members of a\nlocal high school play\nhave fallen unconscious.\nThe mystery behind this\nstrange occurrence is\nslowly unravelled through\ndocumentary-style interviews with witnesses, first\nresponders and more, as\nwell as re-enactments of\nthe events leading up to\nthe performance night.\nThe first act is almost\nexclusively made up of\nbrief monologues by those\ninvolved in the incident\nin one way or another.\nAlthough a promising\nidea, this makes it hard to\ncare about the characters\u2019\nexperiences of the events,\nas each small monologue\nfeels disconnected from\nthe rest, and is a bit too\nbrief to dig deep into the\ncharacters\u2019 psyche.\nThe second act is considerably more exciting\nas the characters start\nengaging in the action and\nsolving the mystery rather\nthan simply providing\nmonologue after mono-logue. The addition of im-mersive elements dotted\nthroughout the second\nact also helps elevate the\nshow, giving it a more\nfresh and exciting feel.\nNear the end, the\nshow gets very meta, and\nperhaps painfully so. A\nlot of it is quite predict-able, and perhaps a little\ncheesy. However, there\nare some carefully planted\nseeds and tricks that pay\noff wonderfully.\nThis is in no small\npart thanks to Alexandra\nSantos\u2019 skillful direction.\nSantos employs excellent\nuse of the UCH stage,\nbrings the best out of her\ncast and makes the most\nout of the underwhelming\nscript. The cast is ex-cellent; some highlights\ninclude Max Fursman\nwho is both hilarious and\nvulnerable and Frankii\nWatson, who shines in\nevery scene she is in.\nBoth Ceara Harper and\nRania Selim also display\nincredible dedication\nto ICSM Drama, with a\ncommitted fall that looked\nlike it would mess up the\nknees, and a vocal-cord\nrupturing scream which\ndeafened me for a good\nthirty seconds.\nThe lighting team were\nexquisite working to\nproduce by far the most\nambitious and challenging\nlighting design ICSM\nDrama has ever attempt-ed. This all pays off, as the\nresult completely elevates\nthe play.\nIn short, TRAP is a gorgeously staged, directed\nandactedplay.Itisashame\nthat the script, which has\nsome excellent elements,\ndoesn\u2019t quite match up\nwith the talent on display.\nRegardless, ICSM Drama\ndeserved to be applauded\nfor taking risks with their\nchoices of play and following through with these\nchoices to result in a fresh,\noriginal end product.\nThe butterfly takes flight // Jane Hobson\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

On\nour respective courses\n(medicine, bioengineering\nand mechanical engineer-ing), Black students in\nparticular are a minority\nwithin the minority of\nstudents of colour. It\u2019s not\njust the shockingly low\nnumbers of Black and\nminority ethnic (BAME)\nstudents at Imperial that\nwarrants discussion, but\nthe wider issue of race\nin academia that we as\nLiberation & Community\nOf\ufb01cers (LCOs) hope to\naddress.\nYou may have heard of\nthe \u2018Decolonise the curriculum\u2019 campaign. Inspired\nby the Rhodes Must Fall\nprotests in South Africa,\nthe campaign calls for\nuniversities to include\nmore BAME academics\nin their curricula. We have\nheard countless times that\nImperial, being a STEM\nuniversity, is immune to\nacademic racism and other\nbiases, rendering race\nan irrelevant issue that\nonly affects humanities.\nIt\u2019s this narrow view that\nhas, in part, contributed\nto the underrepresentation\nof BAME students at\nImperial.\nRace impacts your\nis also very low relative to\nLondon\u2019s Black popula-tion. As the College aims\nto increase admission\nof BAME students, it\nmust also consider its\nresponsibility to give\nthose students equal\nopportunities to \ufb02ourish\nonce they arrive. This\nincludes responding to\nBAME students\u2019 reports\nof alienation that are\nre\ufb02ected in the numbers.\nThe ways in which we\nare taught the history of\nscience and technology at\nImperial often centre on\nWestern discoveries and\ninnovations and ignore the\nmeaningful contribution\nof scientists from other\nparts of the world, past\nand present. Decolonising\nis about rethinking, replaces of intellectual con-frontation; students should\nbe taught to challenge\nthe canon and consider\nalternatives from different\ncultural perspectives.\nWe want to stress that\ntalking about race is\nto inform, not attack. Decolonising the curriculum\nis not about completely\neliminating white men\nfrom our lectures. It\u2019s\nabout identifying the\nomissions in our teaching\nthat limit our understanding of science.

The\nfeminists have got what\nthey wanted, namely\nthe right to vote and the\nexpansion of reproductive\nrights. They\u2019ve tired\nthemselves out from discussing sexual liberality\nand so now feminism has\nbecome a scholarly topic,\nresigned to discussion\nwithin lecture halls\namongst top academics.\nThe second wave of fem-inism, which ushered in\nnew debates about topics\nsuch as domestic violence,\nmarital rape and legal inequalities had diminished\nand dwindled, until it was\nno more. This is the era of\npost-feminism.\nPicture this: it\u2019s the\nearly 90s and young punk\nwomen are harassed in a\nsubculture that has progressively made it difficult for them to be part of.\nThe dregs of punk leftover\nfrom the 70s are now\noppressively macho, with\nmany women assaulted\nat gigs; punk bands\ncontaining women often\ndon\u2019t succeed as well as\ntheir male counterparts.\nOne of the most radical\nsocialist movement to\nhave existed became\ntoxic to some of its most\nproliferate supporters. So,\nthese supporters spoke\nup, and created a space\nto safely speak freely\nabout being a female punk\nrocker: fan zines. These\nwere DIY leaflets and\n\u201cTheuseof\u201crrr\u201d\nwas to regain\nthe meaning of\n\u2018girl\u2019and turn it\ninto something\nthat growls\nback\u201d\nbooklets addressing the\nculture woman and the\nqueer community faced\nand creating and discussing their own culture in\nresponse. Notably, Tobi\nVail and Kathleen Hanna,\ntwo women living in\nWashington began their\nown DIY zine, called\nBikini Kill. They decided,\nalong with two other\nfemale zine-producers,\nthat to fully spread their\nmessage to the punk com-munity, they needed to\nexpress it in the only way\npunks really knew how:\nthrough music. Bikini\nkill the fan zine became\nBikini Kill the band.\nBikini Kill were soon\njoined by more: Bratmobile, Babes in Toyland,\nHuggy Bear, 7 Year Bitch,\nL7 and Jack Off Jill, to\nname a few, were instrumental in the newly found\nRiot Grrrl movement.\nThe term Riot Grrrl came\nfrom numerous sources,\nbut reflected the need for\na \u201cgirl riot\u201d, with grrrl\nrepresenting firstly the\nempowerment of being\na girl before growing up\nand having patriarchal\nexpectations placed upon\nthem, and secondly the\nuse of the \u201crrr\u201d, used to\nregain the meaning of the\nword into something that\ncould bite back and growl\nat the system. The second\nissue of Bikini Kill (the\nfan zine) published the\n\u2018riot grrrl manifesto\u2019.\nThis put into words\nwhat the movement was\nacting for and trying to\nachieve: \u201c[we] seek to\ncreate revolution in our\nown lives every single\nday by envisioning and\ncreating alternatives to\nthe bullshit capitalist\nway of doing things\u201d and\nthat \u201cwe don\u2019t wanna\nassimilate to someone\nelse\u2019s (boy) standards\nof what is or isn\u2019t\u201d. The\nRiot Grrrl movement of\ncourse took on the punk\nphilosophy of the DIY\nscene, relying only on\nthemselves and being\nself-sufficient. It also\nproduced its own look,\ndrawing from the strong\nlooks of punk culture but\nmaking it unapologetical-ly feminine to promote\nits principles visually.\nThe Riot Grrrl movement\nquickly became its own\nsubculture, associated\nwith a particular sound,\nstyle and politics.\nThe movement discussed views on issues\nrevolving around sexual-ity, rape, domestic abuse\nand female empower-ment. This comes across\nstrongly in many of the\nlyrics of some of the Riot\nGrrrl bands, such as in\nBikini Kill\u2019s most famous\nsong \u2018Rebel Girl\u2019: \u201cIn\nher kiss, I taste the revolution/\u2026They say she\u2019s\na dyke but I know/she is\nmy best friend yeah\u201d, and\nalso in L7\u2019s song \u2018Pretend\nWe\u2019re Dead\u2019: \u201cTurn the\ntables with our unity/\nThey neither moral nor\nmajority/Wake up and\nsmell the coffee/Or just\nsay no to individuality\u201d.\nThe themes Riot Grrrls\ndiscussed were often seen\nas unseemly, however\nthis was (and still is)\nthe reason for talking\nabout these issues, as by\nhighlighting the problem\nand then giving women\nand the queer community\nplatforms from which to\nshare their experiences it\ncan aid in stopping it from\nhappening. Often at Riot\nGrrrl gigs young women\nwere given microphones\nso they could share their\nexperiences of sexual\nassault to the rest of the\naudience in an attempt to\nopen up the discussion\nsurrounding these issues.\nKathleen Hanna famously\nintroduced the \u2018girls to the\nfront\u2019 concept as well, by\nencouraging women to the\nfront and even personally\nenforcing the rejection of\nmen from venues who had\nsexually assaulted female\naudience members.\nDespite the worldwide\nmedia hype around alternative rock music in the\nnorthern states at the start\nof the 90s (i.e. Nirvana),\nRiot Grrrl bands managed\nto mostly remain under-ground, probably due to\ntheir discussion around\ndifficult issues which\nmainstream media did\nnot want to publish, especially in a time where\nfeminism seemed to be\nover. The little media attention given to them was\noften provoked by picking\nup on Riot Grrrl acts but\nwithout mentioning the\nwhy the artist was doing\nit, such as writing \u2018slut\u2019\non the performing artist\u2019s\nbody to reclaim the word.\nThe movement often got\nwronglyattributedtosome\nbands, such as those who\nwere non-political or fe-male-fronted. The media\u2019s\nresponse meant that the\nRiot Grrrl movement\ndidn\u2019t take off worldwide,\nand by the mid-90s had\ndied out, although some\nbands kept going such as\nSleater-Kinney. Girl-power, as promoted by Riot\nGrrrls, did eventually hit\nthe media through artists\nsuch as The Spice Girls\nbecoming popularised.\nLooking back, the Riot\nGrrrl movement is now\nattributed to the beginning\nof third wave feminism,\nwhere feminists sought\nto change the systems\nthat the first two waves\nof feminism gained rights\nfrom, and break down\nthe ideologies that gave\nmen permission to decide\non women\u2019s issues and\nthat trained women to be\nsubservient to them. It\nalso built on the idea of\npromoting individuality\nand opening up feminism\nto women of colour and\ntransgender women.\nWhile Riot Grrrl may be\nlong gone, many of its\nprinciples live on in mod-ern-day feminism \u2013 surely\nsocial media is just an\nupdated zine?\nFirst mention of Riot Grrrl in a zine // Fales Library NYU\n7 Year Bitch showing off the Riot Grrrl style // Wikimedia\n\n"

    "content": "The Past is Out to Get You!\nT\nhere is a certain\nexpectation in\nthe air, when you\nchoose to spend\nthe leap day viewing a\nplay, as opposed to the\nvarious other things that\nyour non-existent social\nlife would have liked you\nto indulge in. This expectation is only heightened,\nwhen you learn that the\nplay is an adaptation of\nHenrik Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts and\nthat it is being staged in\nthe tiny Meeting Room 5\nin Union building. While\nthe former was enticing\nenough, the opportunity\nto see a play intimately\nstaged in a room that can\nat best accommodate 25\npeople, was an offer I\ncould not refuse.\nGhosts, when it first\npremiered in 1882, was\nmet with controversy\nand outright disdain.\nPerhaps because many\nof the social themes ad-dressed, including incest\nand extra-martial affairs,\nwere in hindsight a touch\ntoo progressive for the\ntime. The play follows\nwidow Helen Alving,\nplayed in this adaptation\nby a singular Nan Fletcher-Lloyd, as she struggles\nto come to terms with her\npast, which unravels itself\nin the most unfortunate of\ncircumstances, hurting all\naround her.\nThe production is\nheavily reliant on acting\nprowess and in this\ninstance, did not disap-point. The tiny room was\nastutely adapted to seat\nthe sizable audience while\nproviding a spacious and\nwell decorated set for the\nactors. The set design and\nlighting, given the close\nquarters, deserves particular credit, faithfully\ntransforming yet another\nunimaginative piece of\nuniquely Imperial architecture into a convincing\nEnglish residence.\nThe members of the\nsmall cast each gave\norganic performances,\nholding back at the right\ntime and capturing the\nstage in their moment.\nThe chilling exchange\nbetween Helen Alving\n(Lloyd) and Catherine\nManders (Sandrine\nChausson) leading up\nto the end of Act 1 is\ncertainly the highlight of\nthe play. Other notable\nperformances include\nMax Davies\u2019s tragic portrayal of Oswald Alving\nlosing his grasp on reality\ntowards the end of the\nplay and Jesidhn Pillai\u2019s\nconvincingly cunning\nperformance as Jacob\nEngrand.\nThe adaptation\nmanaged to capture the\ndepth of despair reflected\nin Isben\u2019s original work\nwhile bringing a certain\ncontemporary flavour\nto the events and the\ndialogue.\nThough not as controversial today as it once\nwas,theproductionproves\nyet again that the play if\nstaged with the right set\nof talent on and off stage\nis quite capable of captivating modern audiences.\nThe strained accents and\npatchy sound work not-withstanding, this was an\namazing performance put\nforth against great odds;\none that deserved better in\nevery way, from a larger\nproduction budget to a\nbigger audience and more\nimportantly, a prolonged\nstanding ovation at the\nend.\nISSUE 1746\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nVaidhiswaran\nRamesh\nArts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "Plastics are bad, but switching to paper is worse\nP\nlastics are created\nby the devil, those\nnonbiodegradable\nmonsters will\ninfiltrate every corner\nof the planet in varying\nsizes, from nanoparticles\nin your body to giant mutated blobs that colonize\nlandfills. When you try to\nkill it with fire, they spew\npoisonous gases, and\nwhen you cut them, they\nbecome more numerous,\nbut are never destroyed.\nPlastics have certainly\nbeen demonized in the\nmedia, and images of\nplastics in the oceans and\nstuck on animals are stuck\nin our minds.\nYou would be rightfully concerned about\nplastic damaging the\nenvironment, but many\nof our first instincts are to\nimmediately switch from\nplastic to using paper or\nother types of packaging.\nNow that is not such a\ngreat idea, and this article\nwill go in detail to explain\nwhy.\nNow when thinking\nabout why we might want\nto use paper instead of\nplastic, the main reason is\nthat plastic is not biode-gradable, while paper is\u2026\nor is it? Here is the thing,\nmany people are not\naware that although paper\nis biodegradable, it needs\nthe correct conditions.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) paper takes just as\nlong as plastic to break\ndown in landfills. There\nis however the advantage\nthat paper will much more\nlikely be recycled, and\nnever end up in a landfill,\nfurthermore, paper can\nbe recycled an infinite\namount of times, while\nfor plastic it is limited.\nThis is also an advantage\nfor other materials such\nas glass and metals over\nplastic.\nHere is the thing,\nthere is also a significant\ndisadvantage of energy\nusage when you compare\nany material to plastic.\nIt is estimated that paper\nbags take four time as\nmuch energy than plastic\nbags to manufacture and\nuse twenty times as much\nwater. From this perspective paper is much worse.\nFurthermore, in the case\nof bags you can reuse\nplastic bags many times,\nas they are very durable,\npaper bags are less likely\nto last a long time.\nPaper being better\nfor the environment is a\ncommon misconception,\nand it is because we never\nquestion how bad paper\nis for the environment.\nWith plastic always being\nslammed in the media,\nwe wrongly assume that\nevery other material is\nbetter. In reality, as with\nevery environmental\nissue, we should do our\nown research before\ndeciding on anything.\nIn reality, switching\nto paper is worse for\nthe environment, and\ncompanies are doing\nthis for greenwashing.\nErasing consumer guilt is\na strategy to make people\nspend more money. It is\ndefinitely not a sustainable\ninitiative, instead it is an\ninitiate to seem sustaina-ble. Look at brands such a\nis very powerful and\nimportant, and we should\nall try and incorporate it\ninto our lives, wherever\npossible. The main lesson\nI learnt from zero-waste\nis to consume more\nconsciously, and think\nSUSTAINABILITY\nPlastics get a bad rep, but are the alternatives that much better? // Wikimedia\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 6TH\nMARCH, 2020 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cRecycling is\ngood in theory,\nbut in reality,\ncompanies\nonly recycle if\nit is profitable\u201d\n\u201cpaper being\nbetter for the\nenvironment\nis a common\nmisconception \u201d\nXiuchen Xu\nSustainability Editor\nFelix Sustainability was founded to\ncreate a platform\nfor discussion about\nenvironmental issues and sustainable\ndevelopment. We are\nopen to articles from\nall points of view.\nPlease get in touch\nif you would like to\nwrite for us using the\nemail address in the\nheader.\nPlastics are painted as the ultimate villain in the environment world, but the truth is of course more complicated\nPrimark, H&M and Boots\nwho have adopted paper\nbags, while polluting the\nplanet with the products\nthey sell in those paper\nbags (and those products\nare probably made from\npolyester or wrapped in\nplastic).\nThe solution would\nbe to not use single-use\npackaging. Plastic is a\ndurable material and can\nmake wonderful things\nthat can be used for years,\nit is only when it becomes\na single use item that it\nbecomes problematic.\nWe should all aspire to\nstay away from all-things\nsingle use, whether plastic\nor paper, but of course\nthat is more easily said\nthan done. As someone\nwho has attempted a\nzero-waste lifestyle, I\u2019ve\ngot to be honest and say\nit is not compatible with\nbeing a busy ass Imperial\nstudent. However, I\u2019ve\nlearnt over time that the\nmovement is not about\nbeing a perfectionist, and\nwe should each do what\nwe can. I believe that the\ncentral philosophy to the\nzero-waste movement\nabout everything you\nbuy, whether you really\nneed it, and on top of the\neconomic cost for you,\nwhat are the externalities\nand costs to the planet and\nothers. Secondly, another\nimportant lesson is that\nreducing, and reusing are\nthe most powerful sustainable day-to-day practices\nyou can have. Recycling\nis good in theory, but in\nreality, companies only\nrecycle if it is profitable,\nfor example, only 9% of\nplastic bottles actually get\nrecycled.\nOf course, the responsibility shouldn\u2019t fall\nall upon the consumer\u2019s\nshoulders, the government\nshould start pressuring\ncompanies to abolish the\nunsustainable practice of\nover packaging and make\nunpackaged produce\nmore readily available\nto everyone. This is the\nonly way forward to make\nchange on a bigger scale.\nIn conclusion,\nwhenever you next\nsee cutlery made from\nbamboo, or bags made\nfrom paper, please\nremember that they are to\nhelp with consumer guilt,\nand not the environment.\nSingle use packaging is\nwasteful and unsustainable no matter the material.\nSo, if you truly want to\nsave the planet, bring\nyour own lunchbox and\ncutlery to Fusion next\ntime, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s\nplastic. Another point I\nhope you learn from this\narticle is that everything\nhas an environmental\ncost, and sustainability\nchoices are not always\nstraight forward, meaning\nthat intuition is not the\nway to go. The world is\nfull of misinformation,\nand it is best to do your\nown research and spread\nawareness to others.\n29\n\n"

There is\ngood news and there is\nbad news. The bad news \u2013\nit has decided to continue\nties with fossil fuel and\narms companies, and\nhas failed to define clear\nquantitative targets or\ntime frames. The way the\npolicy is loosely worded\ndraw concerns over\nwhether there will be real\nchange, and responses to\nemails suggest the college\nis already going back even\non these policies.\nThe good news is that\nthe College has decided\nto stop all investments\ninto tobacco companies,\nincluding withdrawal\nof indirect investments,\nsuch as through investment funds. Divestment\nfrom tobacco will not\nonly benefit Imperial\u2019s\nconscience, it will benefit\nwider society - the cost of\nsmoking-related diseases\nto the NHS was \u00a32.6 bn\nin 2015. Another commendable step the college\nhas taken is to pledge\nthat its fund managers\nwill become a signatories\nto the UN Principles of\nResponsible Investment,\nwhich is underpinned by\nsix guidelines for invest-ment.\nUnfortunately it is not\nall good news. Thermal\ncoal and tar sands are\nsome of the most polluting\nfossil fuels. BP, Shell and\nChevron all continue to\nengage in their extraction.\nChevron, which employs\nImperial\u2019s president Alice\nGast, has recently opened\nup a new tar sands project\nin Venezuela. In the\nannouncement emailed to\nall members the college,\nit was announced that\nthe College will \u201cdivest\nfrom direct and indirect\ninvestments in companies\nengaged in these activities\n[coal and tar sands]\u201d. Yet\nin an informal clarification from the Provost in\nresponse to a request for\nclarification, made available by Divest Imperial, he\nallegedly stated that the\ncollege would not be divesting from BP, Chevron,\nor Shell, claiming that\nthe policy only applies\nto organisations \u201cwhose\nsole business is coal or\ntar sands\u201d. This explicitly\ngoes against the policy\nwhich members of the\npublic would read, and\nthis treatment of its\npolicies if true, can at best\nbe described greenwash-ing by the college.\nFurthermore, it is not\nclear how the college\nwill treat non-financial\nties and avoid locking\ngraduates into career\npaths in fossil-fuel\nextraction which have\nlimited future prospects.\nThe College suggests that\nit will affect companies,\namong other means,\nthrough its \u201cinfluence as\na world-leading university\u201d and its \u201ceducational\nprogrammes\u201d. Call me\nnaive, but I believe letting\ncompanies whose primary\npurpose is to extract fossil\nfuels have easy-access to\ngraduates and influence\nwhich skills are taught at\nthe highest impact uni-versties in the world does\nnot seem congruent with\na carbon neutral world.\nNot because people who\nwork at such companies\nare uninformed or evil,\nbecause they aren\u2019t, but\nbecause they are obliged\nby the a broken system to\nspend their days as cogs in\na machine that is driving\nunprecedented damage\nto climate. As much as\nwe need investment in\neducation, we also need\nfreedom for people with\nthe skills and creativity\nto make renewables into\na reality at the immense\nscale required. Teaching\nstudents skills to extract\nfossil fuels and hosting\ncareer fairs with large\nfossil fuel companies\ngives students a distorted\npicture of where their\ntalent can be applied.\nCollege has decided to\n\u201cdivest from arms manufacturers who manufacture illegal weapons\u201d. At\nfirst glance this seems like\na good policy, but read it\nagain. Illegal? Unless the\ncollege has, until now,\nbeen investing into illegal\nweapons such as biological weaponry or proliferation of nuclear arms,\nthis policy is barely worth\nthe paper it is written on\nbecause few companies\ninvolved in illegal arms\nmanufacturing would\npublicise it. From a recent\nfreedom of information\nrequest, we know that\nthe college invests into\nLockhead Martin, the\nlargest arms manufacturer\nin the US and which\nwent though a number of\nbribery scandals in the\n1950s - 1970s. Lockhead\nMartin in the UK manufactures Trident nuclear\nwarheads loaded on\nsubmarines. Rather than\nrelying on the government\nto ascertain which investments are permitted, the\nCollege should be decide\nitself whether investments\ninto instruments designed\nto kill is socially respon-sible.\nGiven how loosely\nworded the statement is,\nas well as failing to set\ntargets for which it can be\nheld accountable, it is yet\ntobeseenwhatrealchange\nin fossil fuel investment\nthe college will take. In a\nUCU debate on Imperial\nand Climate earlier this\nweek, it was clear that\nthis policy will involve\nFurthermore, we already\nwe have more proven\nreserves more oil and\ngas than we are able to\nburn without causing catastrophic climate change\nof more than 2 degrees\nCelsius. The second claim\nis that CCS technologies,\nsuch as pumping carbon\ninto depleted oil wells will\nmitigate the effects.

Big Brain Revolution explores the intersection between\nartificial intelligence and psychology - how it impacts our brain.\nBOOKS\nJonah Beaudin\nBooks Writer\nM\ni c h e l l e\nT e m p e s t\ng u i d e s\nthe reader\nthroughAI technology and\nhow it has the potential of\nbring about a paradigm\nshift in the use technology to drive innovation,\nhowever she also reveals\nfuture risks and ethical\nimplications that we must\naddress before it is too\nlate. BIG BRAIN EVOLUTION is an insightful\nglimpse into the world of\nartificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnology. Dr. Tempest,\na Cambridge University\nlecturer of medical law\nand ethics and long time\nmanagement consultant\ndraws from her vast experience in medicine and\ntechnology to introduce\nlaymen-readers to the\ntechnology.\nThe potential of AI as a\nconstructive societal force\nhighlights the vast amount\nof untapped potential and\nopportunity which lies\nwithin the capabilities\nof the technology. For\nexample the genetic\nhome-testing company\n23andme now owned by\nAlphabet, i.e. Google,\nis collecting genetic\ninformation of hundreds\nof thousands of people.\nThe combination of one\nof the largest global tech\ncompanies and a treasure\ntrove of genetic data may\nenable data scientists to\nunlock the mystery of the\ngenetic code. An alternative use of the technology\nlies in drug discovery with\ncompanies like BenevolentAI, which focus on the\ndeveloping new pharma-ceuticals. BenevolentAI\nplans on leveraging their\nexpertise in computer\nscience to develop an AI\nbased platform for drug\ndiscovery. With high\nthroughput testing being\nthe standard method for\ndrug discovery, AI may\noffer a method to cut\ndown the need of testing\nthousands of compounds\nfor efficacy.\nDr. Tempest describes\nhow the data driven\nObama campaign and\nhow it changed the way\nin which presidential\ncampaigns are run today.\nWhile Obama was the\nmost consequential\nAmerican president of this\nmillennium, in the future\nwe may encounter digital\ncandidates, and I do not\nmean Hilary Clinton. The\n\u201cThe system\nhopes to\ndeliver bias\nfree policy on\ncentral issues\nlike healthcare,\nclimate\nchange, and\neducation\u201d\n\u201cAn\nindividual\u2019s\nFacebook likes\nmay represent\na better\nfamiliarity\nwith a person\nthan their\nspouse would\nshow\u201d\ndigital presidential candidate AI Alice received\n25,000 votes in Russia\u2019s\npresidential election. The\nsystem hopes to deliver\nbias free policy on central\nissues such as healthcare,\nclimate change and educa-tion. Tempest does not shy\naway from demonstrating\nto the reader how some\ncompanies take advantage\nof AI technology instead\nof using it for altruisti-cally.\nTempest also writes\nabout those who are\nunfortunately taking\nadvantage of AI technol-ogy, using it for nefarious\npurposes. One of the most\nfamous examples being\nCambridge Analytica illegitimately taking the data\nof millions of Facebook\nusers to support Donald\nTrump\u2019s presidential\ncampaign. Users\u2019 unfazed\nby privacy concerns are\ncreating loopholes for\ndata broker companies\nto collect personal and\nintrusive data on indi-viduals, which they are\npermitted to sell on to\n3rd parties. \u201cData brokers\noperate behind a veil of\nsecrecy\u201d Tempest warns,\nwith advertisers and politicians taking advantage\nof potentially vulnerable\nconsumers.\nIt is postulated that an\nindividual\u2019s Facebook\nlikes may represent a\nbetter familiarity with\na person than their own\nspouse would show. As\nconsumers, Tempest\nwrites, we interact with\nmachine learning algorithms on a daily basis,\nbe it through Instagram,\nSpotify or Amazon. While\nindividual algorithms\ndictate what music we\nlisten to, the news we read\nand what products we buy\nthe future may become\neven more intrusive.\nThe neurotechnology\ncompany Neuralink for\nexample is currently\ndeveloping implantable\nbrain machine interfaces.\nAccording to its founder\nElon Musk one of the\ncentral issues facing\npeople today is the limited\nspeed at which we can\ntransmit and receive data.\nImagine moving away\nfrom your two thumbs or\n10 fingers to having your\nwhole brain operating\nelectronic devices. While\nthe prospects of having\nimproved brain-ma-chine interfaces sounds\ntempting, it inevitably\nwill expose even more\nhuman vulnerabilities to\nthose willing to exploit\nthem.\nAny well informed\ncitizens we must be made\naware of the potential\nbenefits and risks that lie\nin artificial intelligence\nand technology, because\nawareness is the only way\nreduce its future misuse.\nTempest therefore\noutlines both sides of the\nargument and allowing for\nthe reader to draw their\nown conclusions on the\nsubject.\nArtificial intelligence // Piqsels\n\n"

It would\nbe unfair to blame an understaffed and\nunderpaid union, when college refuses\nto cooperate in almost any way shape or\nform. Students are struggling financially?\nLets increase rent! Student reports that\nthey have been assaulted? We will quietly\ninvestigate and make sure nothing happens\nto the abuser publicly, so we do not gain\nany bad reputation. Union does not have\nDmitrii Usynin\nCandidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Welfare)\nenough money to keep a consistent number\nof full-paid staff? Well the president, who is\non the board of directors of Chevron (cough\ndivest cough) surely does (plus many other\nperks). What was the response to these?\nThere wasn\u2019t: neither college, nor the\ncurrent wellbeing team has done anything\nabout it except for censoring student-run\nfacebook pages, trying to be silent about\nstudents being assaulted and continue to\nmake life more difficult for those who try to\nchange this.\nWhat is the point of this rant? How will\nit help me get elected? It probably wont.\nBut for the past years my campaigns have\nachieved exactly what I wanted it to achieve:\nthere are now more qualified people running\nthan ever that genuinely care and want to\nmake a difference.

During\nthe past year as wellbeing Dep Rep, I have\nnoticed how the focus has been straying\naway from the more concerning welfare\nmatters and towards less significant issues.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - small changes do\nhelp. But this isn\u2019t enough anymore; we\u2019re\nstuck in a treadmill - taking steps forward\nwithout actually moving.This is especially\ntrue for mental health. Whether its the one-off panic attack or a lifelong mental disorder,\nImperial is not providing the necessary\nresources to promote a healthy state of\nmind for all. For these reasons, I want to\nstep up to a position where I can enact\nlarge-scale change that will mark a positive\ndifference in students\u2019 lives.\nSome proposals:\n- Organize a mental health awareness\ncampaign (We Need toTalk), focused on\nspreading information, such as how to\ndetect and deal with deteriorating mental\nhealth (in yourself and others), as well as\ntackling the stigmas surrounding most\ndisorders.\n-Train staff to tackle sensitive situations\nappropriately, and facilitate struggling\nstudents\u2019 access to counseling services and\nmitigating circumstances.\n- Implement schemes to encourage all\nstudents to join a society, especially sports\nclubs.\n- Promote union-run socials and make them\nmore inclusive and accessible to all.\n- Improve knowledge surrounding the\ncollege\u2019s available resources for students in\ndifficult financial situations.\n- Host seminars on managing debt,\ndecreasing bill expenses, budgeting, saving,\nand building credit.\n- Increase greenery throughout campus.\n- Challenge labs to become more\nsustainable.\n#icuElections\n\n"

This is particularly true for a city that\nhas endured a troublesome\nperiod in the last year.\nHong Kong, a city unique\nfor its history and identity,\nmarked by cultural exchanges between East and\nWest, whose streets have\nwitnessed overcrowding\nand tear gas and unreal\nemptiness in the span of\nless than 12 months.\nWhile this unreal\nquietness has blanketed\nthe city in the midst of\nthe epidemic, what was\nknown as the Fragrant\nHarbour will certainly\nnot succumb to the crisis\nit faces. Fights and political bipolarism have only\nbeen set aside, awaiting\nthe right moment for a\nrampant comeback.\nIn order to better understand the peculiar situation\nof Britain\u2019s last colony,\nI analysed an instructive\nlecture that was recently\ndelivered by Lord Patten,\nHK\u2019s last Governor. Then\nI also had an illuminating\ntalk with Professor John\nCarroll, who currently\nteaches History at Hong\nKong University. Below\nare the principal points we\nAn analysis of the political situation in Hong Kong with the help of HKU Professor John Carroll\nHong Kong skyline // Pixabay\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 6TH\nMARCH, 2020\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ndiscussed.\nThe Handover\nOne thing I was particularly eager to consider was\nthe issue of Hong Kong\u2019s\nhandover to China.\nChina and the United\nKingdom agreed to an\norderly restitution of the\nterritory from British to\nChinese sovereignty in\n1984. The document con-cretising this decision was\nsigned in that year by UK\nPM Margaret Thatcher\nand her Chinese counterpart Zhao Ziyang. The\nreason behind this agreement was the approaching\nexpiry, in 1997, of the 99\nyears lease of the New\nTerritories, a signi\ufb01cant\npart of what by that time\nHong Kong had become.\nThe land was originally\nceded by Imperial China\nas a consequence of its\ndefeat in the Third Opium\nWar. The negotiations\nconcerning the terms of\nthe restitution did not\ninvolve any participation\nfrom the people of Hong\nKong, who had to accept\npassively the decisions\nothers were making for\nthem.\nThe question of why\nHong Kong was not\noffered any referendum,\nas for other countries in\nthe British Empire, is\ntherefore noteworthy.\nProfessor Carroll underlined that in Hong Kong\nalthough such a scenario\nmay have been prospected\nby some activists in the\n1950s, there was actually\nChina or was holding\nHong Kong better for the\ninterests of the UK?\nThe answer appeared\nclear to Margaret Thatcher\nwho \u201cwas not committed\nto democracy\u201d and rather\n\u201chated Communism\u201d, and\nso, ironically, I would\nadd, ended up giving one\nof the greatest gifts a\nCommunist country has\never received.\nProf. Carroll was\nhowever keen to underline that nonetheless, the\nhandover also marked\nthe end of British colo-nialism, a reality that for\nmost of history meant sufferance and oppression.\nOnly its last exponent,\nnamely Lord Patten, tried\nto implement some sort\nof democratic reform,\nwhile until that point the\nUK had basically never\ngranted any form of public\nparticipation for Hong\nKong citizens in decision\nmaking. For this approach,\nLord Pattern became a\ncontroversial \ufb01gure in\nparticular coldly received\nby China, which maintained that after the Joint\nDeclaration, no further\nchange in the government structure of the\ncolony should have been\nmade. The last Governor\nclaimed instead that no\npolitical establishment\nno mass movement\ntowards this goal. He\nnoted, however, that secret\nplans about a referendum\nmay be elucidated by the\nBritish Government, but\nthe only way we can \ufb01nd\nout is through declassi\ufb01ed\n\ufb01les that are periodically\nreleased by the govern-ments.\nThe other side of the\ncoin is that China would\nnever have allowed such\nan act of self-determi-nation and China\u2019s rise\nwas indeed a fact that\ncould not be underesti-mated. This was already\ncommon knowledge in\n1967, a violent year for\nHong Kong marked with\nfrenzied clashes, when the\nUK instructed its of\ufb01cials\nin the Colony not to excessively repress dissenting Communists, fearing\nto anger China. By 1984,\nProf. Carroll says, \u201cChina\nwas the bigger picture\u201d\neconomically speaking; in\nother words, was having\na better relationship with\nHong Kong politics: he\nhas been praised by some,\ndemonised by others. As\nProf. Carroll recalled,\nhe was even given some\nderogatory nicknames,\ne.g. \u201cthe Prostitute of the\nMillennium\u201d.\nLord Patten\u2019s democratic reforms were in\n6\nHong Kong districts map.

    "content": "After HalfADecade Caribou Suddenly Returns\nF\nive long years\nhave passed\nand finally Dan\nSnaith has made\na return under his moniker\nCaribou. Suddenly is the\nfifth release from the\nCanadian musician and\nthis most recent project is\ndistinctly more personal\nthan Snaith\u2019s previous\nreleases.\nChange is the central\ntheme of the album,\nas Snaith has decided\nto tell stories from\npersonal relationships.\nFor example, the opener\n\u201cSister\u201d explores difficulties Snaith has with\nhis siblings and \u201cHome\u201d\nabout a friend of his who\nended a toxic relationship.\nIn Suddenly Snaith\ndemonstrates the mastery\nhe has achieved over his\ndistinct contemporary\nstyle, combining synthetic\nand acoustic elements\nresulting an exceptionally\nsoulful electronica sound.\nAs he\u2019s been known to do,\nSnaith avoids quantising\nhis music too much,\nallowing irregularities\nthat in most electronic\nmusic would be considered \u201cerrors\u201d. The slight\nlack of rigidity only adds\nto the albums character.\nThe intimacy of topics\nis the album is amplified\nby the way in which Snaith\nuses his voice throughout.\nEver so softly, slightly\nheld back, like being at\na private show just for\nyou. However, Snaith\u2019s\nvocals are never too timid\nto be pushed down by the\ninstrumental. Even on the\ntrack\u201cYouandI\u201d,amongst\njarring beat switches and\na beautifully crisp wailing\nguitar, Snaith\u2019s tempered\nvoice still holds its place.\nWhile a more personal\ntouch has been taken,\nthe album is not lacking\nin infectiously energetic\nmoments. \u201cNew Jade\u201d\npacks a tidy punch with\nbusy percussion and\nglitchy vocals. The track\n\u201cNever Come Back\u201d\nfeels like a contemporary\ntake on the house style of\n808\u2019s, catchy piano riffs\nand soulful vocals.\nTracks-by-track there is\na lack of flow. The album\nhas been constructed in\na patchwork style where\nthere is a distinct sonic\nshade being presented\n(much like the block\ncolour artwork of the\nsingle releases). One of the\nclearest shades painted is\nin the lead single \u201cHome\u201d.\nThe style is a take on old\nschool hip-hop sample\ncentred beats. Snaith has\ncommented on how he\narranged the sampled\nvocals to act as a sort of\nduo/call-and-response,\ntwo people returning\nhome to their loved ones.\nIt\u2019s wonderfully melan-cholic, the kind of song\nyou imagine reconnecting\nwith an old friend over.\nThe patchwork\nassembly of the album\ncan do it a bit of a disservice at times. Listening\nthrough the whole album,\ntransitions from one song\ncan leave an aftertaste that\nspoils the next. However,\nthis is a relatively minor\ndisruption as the character\nof each track is so distinct\nit\u2019s hard not to get lost\nback into the music.\nSuddenly is an exception return for Snaith and\nwell worth the wait. We\ncan only hope that the\nnext release is a bit more\nsudden than this one.\nCaribou the human, not the animal // Billboard\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 6TH\nMARCH, 2020 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Caribou.

    "content": "ISSUE 1746\nFELIX\n7\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwas perpetually stable\nand that reforms were an\nineluctable attribute of the\nact of governing.\nChina\u2019s not so\ninvisible hand in\nHK\u2019s affairs\nAs Prof. Carroll\nexplains, while this\nattitude meant that Lord\nPattern had a very tense\nrelationship with China\nfor the \ufb01rst years of his\nmandate, things then\ngradually improved.\nThis is in stark contrast\nwith his predecessor and\nonly other former HK\nGovernor still alive, Lord\nWilson. He has always\nused quieter tones with\nrespect to China and his\nadministration has been\ngenerally appreciated by\nthe PRC. That is why it\nis interesting to underline\ntheir differing thoughts\nconcerning Chinese\nmeddling in Hong Kong\u2019s\naffairs. Lord Wilson has\nrecently claimed in a\ndebate in the House of\nLords, that the only overt\nviolation of the \u201cone\ncountry, two systems\u201d\nprinciple established in the\nJoint Declaration has been\nthe kidnapping of Lee\nBo and other booksellers\nin the last decade. On\nthe \ufb02ip side, Lord Patten\ndelivered a lecture at the\nbeginning of February in\nwhich he af\ufb01rmed, that\nwhile China was overall\nabiding to such principles until 2012, things\nchanged when Xi Jinping\nbecoming Secretary of\nChinese Communist\nParty.\nAfter that year, a\nmeddling campaign had\nclearly begun, and it\nwas that one of the main\nreasons that sparked the\n2014 and 2019 protests. I\nwas therefore interested in\nProf. Carroll\u2019s opinion on\nthese diverging views.\nHis reply was that most\nHong Kong people do\nbelieve that several forms\nof meddling actually\nhappened, starting even\nin the 2000s. However, he\nstated that the de\ufb01nition\nof meddling is not easy\nto de\ufb01ne as the Joint\nDeclaration is indeed a\nloose agreement, even\nthough it was the object of\nprolonged negotiations. It\nwas the fruit of a complex\ncompromise between\nthe UK and China. The\nresult, he said, is that\ntoday, in Hong Kong\u2019s\nbipolar political scene, the\npro-democracy camp says\nthat the pro-China camp\n\u201conly understands one\ncountry\u201d, and vice versa,\nthe latter believes that the\nformer \u201conly understands\ntwo systems\u201d.\nThe comparison\nwith Macau\nWhile Hong Kong is\nembattled in re\ufb02ections\nand deeply shaken by\nprotests, its most notable\nneighbour, Macau,\nremained silent. Macau\nnonetheless shares a\nbackground of European\ncolonialism as well. I\nwas hence interested in\nthe reason behind this\ndifference in behaviour.\nFor addressing this issue\nmy interlocutor was especially useful, given the\nfact that one of his main\nareas of interest, along\nwith HK\u2019s history, is colonialism in Asia.\nHe explained to me\nhow the political structure\nof Macau was very different to that of Hong Kong.\nIndeed, it was created by\nthe Portuguese to serve\nas a commercial outpost\nand was not even a colony\nuntil the late 19th Century.\nThere, Chinese judges\nretained their role and\nlocal authorities remained\nvery in\ufb02uential: in other\nwords, it was a type of\ncolony the British did not\nwant to emulate when\nestablishing Hong Kong\nafter the First Opium War.\nWhen in 1974 the\nCarnation Revolution\nbrought an abrupt end to\nthe fascist regime which\nwas ruling over Portugal,\nthey began the process of\ndecolonisation. Although\nformally relinquishing\nthe sovereignty of Macau\nto China, Portugal was\nencouraged by China to\nmaintain the administration of it for some time\nwhilst it negotiated the\nrestitution of Hong Kong.\nThen after the Joint Declaration was signed, China\ncame back to the issue of\nMacau.\nOriginally, the PRC\nwanted HK and Macau\nto be handed over at the\nsame date, but Portugal\nadvanced some counter-proposals. It asked indeed\nforMacau tobegivenback\nto China in 1999 instead\nof 1997 as Hong Kong\nwas, in order to celebrate\nthe 250th anniversary of\nthe acknowledgement by\nthe Chinese Empire of\nPortuguese presence in\nChina, which occurred in\n1749. But then, Portugal\nrequired that a new airport\nbe built in Macau, that\nthe Catholic Church be\ngranted a special status in\nthe region, and that Portuguese citizenship had\nto be given to Macanese\npeople (i.e. people of\nmixed Portuguese and\nAsian descent).\nChina\u2019s initial answer,\nProf. Carroll explained,\nwas a refusal of all these\nrequests. China was\nindeed already building an\nairport in the nearby city\nof Zhuhai. It also neither\nwanted to concede privileges to the Church, given\nits tense relationship with\nthe Vatican, nor allow a\npart of Macau population\nto hold a second passport,\nsince China allows its\ncitizens to have only one\nnationality.\nEventually Portugal\ngot everything it wanted,\nwithout even having a\nChinese-speaking person\nat their Foreign Of\ufb01ce\nat that time. The reason,\nProf. Carroll states, was\nprobably because of\nthe Tiananmen Square\nmassacre and the consequent international isolation China was subjected\nto.\nFurthermore, a parallel\nbetween Macau and\nHong Kong, he says, is\nboth useful and useless\nat the same time due\nalso to the size of Macau\n(about 600,000 people,\nin contrast to the over 7\nmillion of Hong Kong)\nand the different attitudes\nThe Rt Hon.

I am currently pursuing a Global\nMasters in Public Health on a college\nscholarship. Standing up for this role is my\nway of saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the college for\nbelieving in me!\nCandidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Education)\nIn my 4 years as a rep, it has become clear\nto me that there are fundamental issues\nboth within the College and academic\nrepresentation. I have a plan to address\nthese.\nImprove Parity\nYour experience at this university varies\ngreatly depending on which department you\nare in, or who your supervisor is. Now is the\ntime for real action on key issues such as:\n- Poor quality of feedback and transparency\nof marking\n- Large variation in quality of supervision,\nand absence of mechanisms for dealing\nMichaela Flegrova with problematic supervisors\n- Lack of student spaces and services in\nsome departments, particularly at non-South\nKensington campuses\nStrengthen the Rep Network\nOnly a strong rep network will be able\nto implement real change.To make\nrepresentation more effective, we must:\n- Improve training to make it more practical\nand role-specific, to make reps better\nprepared for their job\n- Develop the rep community for both\nundergraduate and postgraduate students,\nby increasing opportunities for cross-departmental interaction and sharing of\ngood ideas\n- Better support individual reps, increasing\nthe number of contact hours with the DPE\nand Union support staff\nMake Change Happen\nEvery year, the College and the Union\nrespond to student feedback by writing lists\nof proposed changes, but little is done to\nensure these are actually followed through.\nI will work with the relevant College staff\nto finally see these plans implemented,\nusing the rep network to make sure no\ndepartment is left out.\nImprove parity. Strengthen the rep network.\nMake change happen. Vote Michaela for\nDPE.\nHere are some of the things I would like to\nask the college for:\n1.

Whether\nyou\u2019re already involved in\nyour DepSoc, enjoy going\nto the smaller events and\nfind the careers support\ninvaluable, or you don\u2019t\nreally have an active\nDepSoc, and you prefer\nthe bar nights, club nights\nand other niche events\nyour CU organises.\nAs someone who is\nhighly involved in both\nmy DepSoc, MathSoc,\nand the RCSU, if you\nasked me which is better\nor has a greater impact, I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to give\nyou a straight answer.\nTherefore I\u2019m not even\ngoing to to try to convince\nyou that one\u2019s better than\nthe other, because that\u2019s\nnot the case. Instead I\u2019m\ngoing to try to show you\nhow both need to work\ntogether harmoniously in\norder to maximise their\npotential and serve their\nusing DepSocs.\nHowever, CUs can\nmanage a couple of things\nDepSocs would struggle\nto achieve:\na) Larger events like\nRevel and Autumn Ball,\nthat small DepSocs would\nnot be able to drum up a\nlarge attendance for.\nb) Niche events like\nyoga and gardening as\nseen in our Welfare Week,\nRCSYou, which only\nattract 5-10 people from\neach department of FoNS.\nHowever if the RCSU\nruns them, then collectively there is a sufficient\ninterest in these events\nc) Engage multiple societies in events, encouraging interdisciplinary\nengagement\nThe role of a CU is to\nsupport its societies, rather\nthan compete with them. It\nshould not run events that\ncould otherwise be easily\norganised by the DepSocs\nor compete with existing\nDepSoc events, such as\nChristmas Dinners or\nmovie/games nights.\nApplying this philosophy in practice, we have\nseen an increase in the\namount of interaction\nbetween the RCSU and\nits 5 consituent DepSocs\nthis year. The DepSocs\nhave actively publicised\nRCSU events while\nthe RCSU has stuck to\nnot competing with its\nDepSocs. However, when\nthe RCSU has run an\nevent that should have\nbeen run by a DepSoc, we\nhave seen the error of our\nways and learnt from our\nmistakes going forward.\nWith what can only be\ndescribed as one of the\nmost successful Revels\nin recent years we were\npleased to have engaged\nmany members from\nWhat side are you on? DepSocs Vs CUs\nCONSTITUENT UNION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nstudent members.\nIf you\u2019re reading this\nnow then you\u2019re one of the\nCU section\u2019s most committed readers. Despite\nthe comments about how\nwe\u2019re not engaging our\nDepSocs enough from\nlast week\u2019s issue, the\nRCSU has come a long\nway in making sure that it\nis not competing with its\nDepSocs this year.\nFor example, whenever\nthe RCSU hosts an event,\nsuch as Roaring Revel, the\nRCSU makes sure that all\nof the DepSocs are firstly\naware of the event, so they\ndon\u2019t schedule their own\nevents at the same time,\nand secondly engaging\nDepSoc members by\nencouraging DepSocs to\npublicise RCSU events.\nThis has been particularly\nsuccessful with events\nsuch as the Mums and\nDads Pub Crawl, Autumn\nBall, Revel and using\nthe DepReps to publicise\nRCSYou.\nThe advantage that\nDepSocs have is that\nthey are able to engage\ntheir freshers easily\nthrough welcome events\nsuch as Mums and Dads,\nleading students to immediately identify with\ntheir DepSoc. CUs find it\nharder to engage students\nin Freshers week without\n33\nacross all 4 departments.\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been\npossible without DepSocs\u2019\nsupport in publicising and\nmaking people aware of\nthe event.\nGoing forward I believe\nthat the relationship\nbetween the RCSU and\nits component DepSocs\nwill only get stronger.\nBy talking more and supporting each other, things\ncan only get better and\nafter the positive changes\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

    "content": "Felix recommends - Books to make your blood boil\nIn celebration of the upcoming International Women\u2019s Day, Felix recommends a selection of rage-inducing reads\nfor the occasion (if you\u2019re in that kind of mood)\nBOOKS\nJia Qi Tan\nBooks Editor\nE\nqual: How we fix\nthe gender pay\ngap by Carrie\nGrace\nThis book entails\nCarrie Grace\u2019s account of\nher challenging unequal\npay at BBC. It started in\nthe summer of 2017 when\na list of the top-earners in\nBBC was released, with\nwhite men dominating the\ntop of the list. This came\nas a surprise to Carrie\nGrace, the China editor of\nBBC News, who discovered she was underpaid\nin comparison to fellow\ninternational editors - the\nonly thing she demanded\nwhen taking on the role\nwas to be paid equally as\nthe North American editor\n- whom now she found\nout - earned double. Thus\nsparked her quest of equal\npay in BBC, her resigna-tion, and BBC\u2019s eventual\napology.\nThe culture of pay\nsecrecy gives way to pay\ndiscrimination - if you do\nnot know how much your\npeers are making, how do\nyou know if you\u2019re paid\nequally? The topic of\nunequal pay is not a new\none, but I have never had\nthe chance to learn much\nbeyond the legislation and\nstatistics (most of which\ncenters around gender pay\ngap, which is not the same\nthing), and the natural\nassumption that with the\nlaws implemented this\nis no longer an issue.\nHowever, there\u2019s more\nto that needs to be done\nto make the world listen.\nThis book sheds light\nupon more details on\nthe subject matter, most\nof which center around\nGracie\u2019s case, but it also\nincludes a practical guide\nand resources to respond\nto workplace inequality\nnear the end of the book.\nIn short, Equal is a\ndeep, gripping read on\nthe topic of equal pay. In\nmany parts, it\u2019s almost\ninfuriating to see how\ndifficult it could be to be\nheard, and how difficult\nit is to ask for something\nto demand an inherent\nhuman right.\nInvisible Women:\nExposing Data Bias\nin a World Designed\nfor Men by Caroline\nCriado-Perez\nInvisible Women, as\nthe title suggests, covers\nthe systematic gender\ndata bias in the history\nof our knowledge, which\nis the root of perpetual\ndiscrimination against\nwomen. It\u2019s profound,\nprovocative, and depressing in many ways. The\nbook encompasses a vast\nrange of topics, from the\npublic transport system\nto toilets, from scientific\nresearch to architecture.\nIt\u2019s eye-opening to see for\nthe sake of convenience\nhow often women are\nignored and neglected,\nwith males being \u201cthe\ndefault human.\u201d It really\nshows how our everyday\nlife can be and is affected\nby the decisions made\nwith that assumption - it\ndoesn\u2019t tell you things you\nalready know. Despite its\nwide coverage, the book\nmaintains a well-or-ganised structure and\ncoherence throughout that\nmakes it easy to read.\nLast summer when I\nworked with laboratory\nrats as an in vivo model\nfor drug development\npurposes, I noticed that\nonly male rats are used\n- because female rats\nhave menstruation and\nare \u201charder to manage,\u201d\nbecause that\u2019s the way the\nmodel is, because that\u2019s\njust the way things are. I\ncould not help but wonder\nits implications of this\nwidely accepted practice\nin biological research\n- the extrapolation of\nthis data onto humans.\nThis inspired me to pick\nup the book as soon as\nit\u2019s released, and in it,\nCriado-Perez addressed\nthis issue alongside many\nothers that need to be\nlooked into.\nCriado-Perez has\nwritten a compelling narrative on a very significant\nmatter. It\u2019s an ambitious\nproject to take on, but she\nhas executed it flawlessly.\nThe level of research\nand statistics included\nare incredible. It\u2019s a long\nbattle to fight, and I do\nhope those in positions\nof influence can read this\nbook.\nNo One Is Too Small\nto Make A Difference\nby Greta Thunberg\nNo One Is Too Small\nto Make A Difference by\nGreta Thunberg has taken\nthe bookstore display\nwindows by storm upon\nits release. It is a collection of eleven speeches\nfrom Thunberg, a Swedish\nteenager who protests for\nclimate change outside\nthe Swedish parliament.\nThe central idea surrounds\nthe urgency of climate\nchange and the need for\nradical changes to be\nmade. She also explained\nthe straightforward logic\nbehind her school strike\nand civil disobedience.\nHer speech may be\nsomewhat repetitive\nbut is nevertheless very\npowerful. As the forefront\nof the climate movement,\nThunberg has unbelievable influence and also\nbeen the target of critics\n- whether she was used is\nanother topic for later.\nOne thing to note is that\nThunberg insisted that we\nalready know what to do,\nthe urgent call now is to\ndo the right thing. In the\nfuture, I hope Thunberg\ngoes more in-depth with\nthe details as to what kind\nof changes we want to\nmake - is it only the duty\nThree women smiling // Pexels\nISSUE 1746\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nof politicians? Aren\u2019t sustainable business models\nand changes in decision\nmaking within industries\nmore impactful? Below is\nan excerpt from the book\nfor you to have a feel of\nThunberg\u2019s passion:\n\u201cAdults keep saying:\n\u2018We owe it to the young\npeople to given them\nhope.\u2019 But I don\u2019t want\nyour hope.

The\ntype and sophistication\nof goods sold increased\nsteadily over time, from\nagricultural products to\nmore complex machinery\nand to the modern service\nsector.\nHowever, not all economies advanced at the same\npace, which resulted in a\ndevelopment gap arising\nbetween them. There were\nmany root-causes of such\nsegregation, ranging from\npolitical in(dependence)\nof a certain country to its\ngeographical location.\nRegardless of the reasons\nbehind this, the present\nresult is clear enough \u2013\nthere is a group of \u2018developed\u2019 countries, and the\nrest that are trying to catch\nup with them. Economists\nstill argue about the exact\nlist of \u2018developed\u2019 coun-tries, but most agree on\nabout twenty-five of them,\nwhich include most of\nWestern Europe, Northern\nEuropean countries,\nU.S.A, Canada, South\nKorea and several more.\nSo which unique qualities\ncontribute to the sorting\nof developed economies\nfrom the emerging ones?\nAgain, there are no strict\ncriteria\u2019s for that, but\nusually the following key\nfactors are taken into\nconsideration:\n1. Gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) per capita:\nthe total worth of goods\nbeing produced inside a\ncountry per its population\nsize.\n2. High standards of\nliving: usually measured\nvia the United Nations\u2019\nHuman Development\nIndex\n3.

Instead, all factors\nshould be considered\nsimultaneously, to build a\nholistic assessment of the\ncountry\u2019s development.\nAt this juncture, it\ncould be misguided\nto think that emerging\neconomies are just a more\npolitically correct way of\nsaying \u2018under-developed\u2019.\nDespite a degree of truth\nin that label, emerging\nmarkets remain hugely\nattractive for potential\ninvestments, and the main\nreason behind that are the\nreturns, which are unseen\nin developed markets.\nThe underlying cause is\nsimple\u2013it is much easierto\ngrow when your economy\nis still not \u2018saturated\u2019 and\nthere is still room for\nexpansion. Simultaneously, this higher growth\nrate also comes with\nhigher volatility, which\nis, in turn, linked with a\nhigher risk of losses for\ninvestors. It may also be\neasily observed that while\ncountries in the developed\ngroup are similar in terms\nof economies, those in the\nemerging category can\nvary quite a lot. There\nare several sub-parties\nwithin this segment. To\nbegin with, all emerging\ncountries could be split up\ninto frontier and regular\nemerging markets, with\nthe former still at a lower\nstage of development.\nMoreover, many countries\nwith similar economic\nstructures are grouped\ninto a single category, a\nfamous example is the\nso-called \u2018BRIC\u2019 (which\ncombines Brazil, Russia,\nIndia and China, and\nwas especially popular\nin the early 2000-s for\nits extremely fast pace\nof growth). Another one\nis BEM \u2013 10 biggest\nemerging economies in\nthe world.

But\nwhat exactly do these\nwords entail and what\ndo investors mean when\nreferring to developed\nand emerging economies?\nThis article is dedicated to\ngetting the reader\u2019s head\naround these widely used\nlabels.\nFirst, let\u2019s jump into\na short (and rather sim-plistic) history of the\nworld economy.

While it does this for the most\npart, significant changes must be made to\nimprove Council\u2019s ability to fulfil this aim.\nAs this year\u2019s RCSU president, I\u2019ve spent\nmy fair share of time on Union Council and\nits subcommittees.The issue with Council\nis that the student body, which it is meant\nto represent, knows little of its activities or\ndecisions.\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the case, especially given\nthat the Union\u2019s policies affect us all, and\nthe implementation of new policy can enact\nCandidate Manifestos: Council Chair\nAlex Auyang great positive change.\nI want to amplify the common student\u2019s\nability to shape our Union by spreading\nawareness of Council and its associated\npolicies. In addition, I will ensure that\nCouncil runs smoothly using my experience\nas a senior volunteer and Council member.\nTo increase participation, I would:\n- Improve accessibility of Union\npolicy for all students to view.\n- Enact a strategy to increase\nstudent awareness of Union Council and its\nactivities, while also encouraging more\nstudents to submit papers.\n- Increase training of Council\nmembers and provide extensive\nsupplementary documentation.\nIn addition, I resolve to:\n- Hold sabbatical officers to\naccount, and ensure that they are serving\nthe wider student body.\n- Run productive Council meetings,\nfocusing on the key issues that students\nface.\nAs Council chair, I believe that I can make\nreal change, fostering a more inclusive, fair,\nand effective student democracy.\nThank you for reading my manifesto.\nCandidate Manifestos: Felix Editor\nCalum Drysdale\nAbout me\nI have been involved in Felix from the\nbeginning of my degree and have been\ninvolved in lots of roles:\n- As a Comment editor this year\nand a copy editor last year\n- As a writer for 5 sections\n- As a frequent contributor of\narticles and horoscopes to the Hangman\nsection.\nI\u2019ve been involved in every step of Felix\u2019s\npublishing, from the initial planning of each\nweek\u2019s paper to sending the final versions\nto print, and I want to see it flourish.\nOutside of Imperial, I am also currently\npursuing a career in journalism and have\nworked with both British and foreign\nnewspapers, spending a month working for\na daily paper in Ghana last summer.\nAs Editor I pledge to:\n- Make the paper a more useful and\ninteresting part of student life.\nThis ranges from improving the quality of\nnews by creating a dedicated team of news\nwriters, to printing a social calendar that will\nallow\nstudents to conveniently see the huge\nvariety of events available to them and\nfor societies to more easily publicise their\nevents.\n- Fix the Felix website so that students\ncan access it anywhere and bring in more\nfunctionality.\n- Bring the editorial schedule up a day, so\nevery article gets the attention it deserves\nand goes to print in the best possible\ncondition.\nDuring my time at Imperial, I\u2019ve seen\nthe Union from every perspective; as a\nstudent, a bar worker, a CSP volunteer and\nas President of the Royal School of Mines\nUnion. I\u2019ve seen the good work that the\nUnion can do when it works democratically,\nefficiently and transparently for the benefit\nof the students.\nThis year, I\u2019ve worked with Faculties,\nDepartments, CSPs and other Constituent\nUnions to ensure that the Union provides an\nexperience we can all look back on fondly.\nWhether rejecting the College\u2019s proposed\nrent increases, reforming the Liberation\nand Community Networks or representing\nChristopher Carter students at Faculty levels, the Union and\nits subsets have the power to positively\nimpact the student experience, and student\nvolunteers are an essential part of that.\nAs StudentTrustee, I\u2019d jump right in and\nspeak up for students who too often feel the\nUnion doesn\u2019t work for them. I will:\n- Provide a strong, independent,\nstudent-focused voice on the Board of\nTrustees when discussing important\nfinancial or administrative matters\n- Prioritise transparency when\nmaking decisions, ensuring all major\ndecisions incorporate an appropriate level of\nstudent consultation\n- Ensure Constituent Unions\nare afforded the support and resources\nnecessary to work for students, as CUs\nhave a greater understanding of the needs\nof the communities they represent\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve shown that\nI have the experience, dedication and\nunderstanding to serve as a StudentTrustee\nof ICU. I hope you\u2019ll give me your vote so\nwe can build a Union that works for you.\nChris\nCandidate Manifestos: Student Trustees (x2)\n\n"
