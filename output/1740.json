    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nJANUARY, 2020\n16\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nItalian Regional Elections: A Test For Populism\nPOLITICS\nLuca Rameli\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhe political\nclimate currently\npervading Italy\nis that of uncer-tainty. As laid out in my\nprevious article, the rise\nof populism in Italy, and\nacross Europe, has been\na major phenomenon of\nthe last decade. Now,\npopulism, with its new,\nbold, and controversial\npresence on the political\nstage, could either further\ndeepen its roots in Italian\npolitics or instead be\noutright rejected. All of\nthis could depend on the\nresult of the elections\ntaking place on Sunday\n26th\nin two Italian regions:\nEmilia-Romagna and\nCalabria.\nThe former is one of\nthe richest regions in\nItaly, with a thriving\neconomy and a highly\ndeveloped healthcare\nsystem (in Italy this is a\nprerogative of regional\ngovernment and not\nof the central state),\nwhile the latter is the\npoorest and plagued by\ncorruption. However,\nthough there are deep\nsocio-economic differences between them,\nthey share some political similarities: they are\nboth governed by the\ncentre-left Democratic\nParty (PD). Since the\n2016 constitutional\nreferendum, the PD\nhas been continually\nlosing political ground,\nto the advantage of the\nNorthern League and\nthe Five Star Movement\n(M5S). While the M5S,\nwhich has both left and\nright leaning members,\nseems to be increasingly\ndivided between these\ntwo currents (some\neven suggest a schism\nis near), the League,\nwhich is right-wing, has\nmanaged to increase its\nnumbers by attracting\nmore moderate electors.\nThe leader of the\nLeague, Matteo Salvini,\nhas indeed been able to\nput great pressure on\nthe current coalition\ngovernment between\nPD and M5S through a\ncontinuous presence in\nin recent times in\nEmilia-Romagna itself,\nwhere the result of the\nelections is the most\nuncertain, while in\nCalabria a win for the\ncentre-right coalition\nto which the League\nbelongs is almost sure.\nIn the richer Emilia-Romagna, the most recent\npolls show a narrow\ncentre-left lead held\nby PD and its allies,\nfollowed closely by the\ncentre-right coalition\nand finally trailing\nmuch behind is the M5S,\nwho has decided to run\nalone, separate from\nany government allies.\nIt is this choice of M5S,\nalong with a consistent\nnumber of undecided\nvoters, that could swing\nthe balance in favour of\none or the other of the\ncontenders.\nThe fall of the affluent\nEmilia-Romagna region\nto the centre-right\nwould be interpreted\nas a great blow for\nthe Democratic Party,\nsince this is a region\nthat has always been\nleft-leaning \u2013 indeed,\nthe Italian Communist\nParty was founded there\nand retained power in\nthe area from the end\nof the Second World\nWar to the 90s, even as\nother centre-left areas\nof the country started to\nembrace more moderate,\ns o c i a l - d e m o c r a t i c\npolitics after the Cold\nWar. However, the\ndestiny of the region is\nstill unwritten, especially with the birth of a new\nanti-populist movement\nin November 2019, that\nof the \u201cSardine\u201d (liter-ally the \u201cSardines\u201d; yes,\nthe fish). Such a bizarre\nname symbolises their\nopposition to the loud,\nbrash political slogans\nof populism, and depicts\nthemselves as the silent\nmajority, as the sardines\nare fish and hence\nsilent, and supposedly\nthe party represents\nnumbers of people large\nenough and with big\nenough presence that\nthey could be imagined\nas tightly packed in\neach constituency, as\nsardines are in a can.\nAside from the question\nof names, which Italian\npolitical organisations\noverall seem to have\npoor taste in, this\nmovement was founded\nonly a few months ago\nby four friends in their\n30s and has since spread\nto every corner of the\ncountry. Their refusal\nto constitute a political\nparty and their criticism\nnot only towards rightwing populism but also\ntowards some characters\non the left, have helped\nthem to consolidate\nand expand their base.\nUnfortunately for Mr\nSalvini, the core of this\nmovement happens\nprecisely to be Bologna,\nthe regional capital of\nEmilia-Romagna, and it\ncan be safely said that it\nhas played a prominent\nrole in thwarting the\ninitial lead held by the\nLeague.\nA war of words and\ndigits has hit the region,\nwith each side competing to have the highest\nnumber of participants\nto each manifestation.\nIn all of this, political\npolarisation is nothing\nnew in Italy, but its\nconjugation with\npopulism has marked\nits adoption of a new,\nworrisome shape. Mr\nSalvini\u2019s tolerant, often\nsympathetic remarks\ntowards far-right groups\nand their stiff stance on\nthe question of immigration on one side have\nmostly contributed to\nthis happening, but the\ncontinuous portrayal of\nthe threat of an authoritarian drift, sometimes\nexcessively, on the other,\nhas also played a part.\nThe racially motivated\nonline threats directed\nfrom far-right members\ntowards Senator Liliana\nSegre, an Italian Jew\nand Auschwitz survivor,\nshows just how dim the\nsituation is and how\ndeep the dignity of men\ncan sink. According\nto Italian law, demonstrations and polls or\nany form of political\nadvertisement cannot be\nconducted anymore on\nthe day preceding the\nelections, in order to let\npeople meditate on their\nchoices undisturbed.\nI do hope this will be\nuseful, but what I can\nsee right now is just the\ncalm before the storm,\na storm with unprecedented strength, much\nlike the violent chaos\ndepicted in paintings by\nTurner.\nStefano Bonaccini, PD candidate for Governor of\nEmilia-Romagna // Wikimedia\nLucia Borgonzoni, League (right) candidate for Governor of Emilia-Romagna // Wikimedia\n\u201cPolitical\npolarisation is\nnothing new\nin Italy, but its\nconjugation\nwith populism\nhas marked\nits adoption\nof a new,\nworrisome\nshape\u201d\nthe squares of the whole\ncountry.\nThe League\u2019s efforts\nand events have seen\na consistent increase\n\u201cSuch a\nbizarre name\nsymbolises\ntheir\nopposition\nto the loud,\nbrash political\nslogans of\npopulism,\nand depicts\nthemselves\nas the silent\nmajority\u201d\n\n"

I\u2019ve\nused them in the Winter\nCarnival, a medics event\nin Embankment, a show\nthis past Wednesday at\nEmbargo Republica, and\nI\u2019ll use them in ACC too!\nIt just really makes things\nmore fun.\nFelix: Where can\npeople catch up with\nwhat shows you\u2019re\ndoing?\nZL: I do have a Facebook page, \u2018Zhengli Lim\u2019,\nas a DJ \u2013 though I don\u2019t\nmaintain it that often.

However,\nthere is a high variance \u2013\nwithin a given week, there\nwill be days where only\n\u00a310 of payments are with\ncash, while on others the\nfigure can reach closer to\n\u00a3600.\nThe DPFS commented\nthat it would be \u201cuseful to\nknow if the cash we take\nis because its an option,\nor because it's the only\noption.\u201d She further clarified that student feedback\nwould be considered:\n\u201cknowing how students\nfeel about going cashless,\nand the impact it had on\ntheir experience with the\nUnion, can significantly\nshape where we go\nmoving forward.\u201d\nThe cashless move\nextends behind the scenes\nas well, with the Finance\ndirectorate dispensing\nwith all petty cash -meaning they cannot\nreimburse small amounts.\nThis is reportedly in\norder to stop the Union\nincurring high transaction processing fees, as\ncharges are calculated\nper-transaction.\nThe DPFS has encouraged students to get in\ncontact at dpfs@imperial.\nac.uk in the run-up to the\ntrial.\ncard.\nThe idea was proposed\nto the Union\u2019s Leadership\nTeam by the Head of\nCommercial Services,\nJulia Mattingley, at the\nend of last term. She cited\nan improvement in effi-ciency, reducing risk from\neither theft or robbery, or\nfrom mishandling of cash.\nHowever, term ended\nbefore the matter could be\nfully discussed with other\nmembers of the Leadership Team, and due to the\nneed for marketing materials to inform students of\nthe change Commercial\nServices made an \u201cexecutive decision was made\nto trial in February\u201d,\naccording to the Deputy\nPresident (Finance and\nServices).\nThe change is also\nintended to be a cost-sav-ing exercise, removing the\nnecessity of processing\ncash \u2013 however, the fine\ndetails of this are still to be\ndiscussed and explained.\nTransactions by card incur\na fee for the vendor, and\nso the cost-savings would\nneed to outweigh this\nadded expense.\nAn additional concern\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

It was a great celebration of dancers, artists,\nchoreographers, musi-cians, and everyone else\nwho has been involved\nin the company\u2019s history\n- the \u201cEnglish National\nBallet Family\u201d. The performance was \ufb01lled with\npassion, joy, and pride and\nthere was a true sense of\ncommunity both on stage\nand in the audience.\nWhat made this performance so unique was the\ndirection, and the structure\nof the performance was\nextremely well thought-out. Each small section\nstarted with a screening\nof a short \ufb01lm or a video,\nfollowed by a performance on a related theme.\nMaking use of archive\nfootage and pictures of the\ncompany from the past, it\nhelped the audience to understand the background\nand history behind a show\nor a repertoire, which\ndoes not usually happen\nin a ballet performance.\nA particularly heartfelt\nexample of this was the\nsegment about the English\nNational Ballet School.\nThe \ufb01lm explained the\nimportance the company\nplaces on education and\ninspiring the younger\ngenerations and the performance that followed\nwas given by the current\nstudents of the school.\nThis structure gave a consistent \ufb02ow and essence\nto the performance and\nhelped link various pieces\nthat may have been\ncompletely unrelated in a\nmeaningful order.\nIt was regrettable that\nthe lengths of the performances varied signi\ufb01cantly. Some pieces seemed\ntoo brief while others ran\nfor a disproportionately\nlong time. It seemed that\nthe limited time could\nhave been better allocated\nto make the performance\nmore engaging, as some\npieces often became\nrepetitive. The dancing\nwas also not completely\npolished, especially in\ngroup performances.\nSome of them were noticeably out of sync which\ndid not present the choreography and the dancers\nthemselves to their full\npotential.\nNonetheless, showcasing some of the most\nsymbolic pieces and\ngreatest hits, the English\nNational Ballet\u2019s 70th\nAnniversary Gala gave\nthe audience a unique\nand rare opportunity to\nwatch a variety of work\nthroughout their history.\nThe performance represented the historic story\nof the English National\nBallet in an innovative\nmanner. Whether or\nnot you are a ballet fan,\nthis event exposes the\naudience to a wide range\nof the company\u2019s work\nalong with the history and\nallows the audience to\nexperience and celebrate\nwhat English National\nBallet stands for.\nFrancesca Velicu and Joseph Caley with the future stars of the English National\nBallet performing La Sylphide // Bill Cooper\nISSUE 1740\nFELIX\n19\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nAya Hayakawa\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Right off the bat we\nwere treated to a nostalgia\nrich trailer for the newest\nremake in the franchise\u2026\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery\nDungeon: Rescue Team\nDX.\nThis is a remake of the\noriginal Blue and Red\nRescue Team games,\nfor the DS and GBA\nrespectively. From the\ntrailer alone it looks to be\na faithful recreation of the\noriginals, with a beautiful\nhand-drawn art style\nand a 3D environment\nwhich only elevates that\nof their predecessor. The\nbest part? It is slated for a\nMarch 6th, 2020 release,\nwith a demo available\nright now; and yes, of\ncourse I have played it.\nStraight away you are\ngreeted by an old friend,\nthe personality quiz.\nAnyone who played these\ngames as a child surely\nhas fond memories of\nthis. The idea of the quiz\nis to figure out which\nPok\u00e9mon is best suited\nto your personality,\nwhether kind and quirky,\nor as the game brutally\nlabelled me: \u201cannoying\nand alienating\u201d. Jeez\nGame Freak no need to\nbe mean. The quiz is not\nalways the most accurate\nin choosing your favourite\nPok\u00e9mon, but luckily\nthere is the welcome\naddition of letting you say\n\u2018no\u2019 and instead choosing\nyour own starter. I chose\nPsyduck (my fave), chose\nBulbasaur as my partner\nand off I went.\nWhen the game\nthrew me into the world,\nI immediately noticed\nhow gorgeous the game\nsimple, as well as roughly\nan hour of gameplay\nbetween the dungeon and\nthe town. The town was\nreally something else.\nBustling with atmosphere\nand things to do, such as\nvisiting the Kecleon shop,\nor depositing items in the\nPersian bank so you don\u2019t\nlose them when you faint.\nSeeing this area I loved as\na child reimagined is such\na gift.\nAs it is only the begin-ning, I naturally found the\ndemo fairly easy; if you\nare worried about diffi-culty, don\u2019t be. The game\ngets much, much harder\nwith 100 \ufb02oor dungeons\nnear the end game truly\ntesting your skills as a\ngamer.\nThe demo is quite\nshort at roughly an hour\nlong, but that\u2019s okay. If\nyou have played the game\nbefore, it is an amazing\nnostalgia kick and if\nyou haven\u2019t, it begins\nan enticing story that is\nsure to draw you in and\nconvince you to buy the\ngame to find out more.\nDefinitely check it out if\nyou haven\u2019t already!\nA nice summary of what you can expect from the demo of everyone\u2019s favourite Mystery Dungeon game. Blue and\nRed Rescue Team have been fused into one complete package and oh my, does it look glorious!\nA Beautiful Logo For a Beautiful Game // press.pokemon.com\n\u201cThe hand-drawn\naesthetic\ncombined with\nthe amazing\nsound brings\nthat extra drop\nof charm to a\ngame already\nfull of it\u201d\nlooked. The originals\nhad a wonderful, sprite-based art style, but the\nhand-drawn aesthetic of\nthis remake combined\nwith the amazing sound\ntrack really brings that\nextra drop of charm to a\ngame already full to the\nbrim with it. As far as I\ncan tell, the dialogue is\nalmost identical \u2013 this is a\ngood thing when the story\nis one of the best in any\nPok\u00e9mon game ever.\nThis is all well and\ngood, but what is a\nMystery Dungeon game\nwithout good dungeons?\nLuckily, the combat,\nexploration and team\nbuilding are the same as\nit was all those years ago:\nrefined and joyous. The\ngameplay is simple and\nrepetitive but hopelessly\naddictive \u2013 it is a Pok\u00e9mon\ngame after all. However,\nit is so wonderfully\nrefined, with the stunning\nbackground making the\ndungeons even more enjoyable to explore and the\nUI showing all the information you need without\ntaking up much of the\nscreen (both in handheld\nand docked mode). You\ntravel through multiple\n\ufb02oors of a dungeon,\nfighting Pok\u00e9mon as you\ngo, in a turn-based grid\nsystem.

Whether it\u2019s in the\ngraphic design of the logo,\nthe name of the company,\nthe way it responds to\ncriticism, the press relations it forms with various\npublications, sponsor-ships, or anything else, it\u2019s\nindisputably essential to\nthe operation and success\nof any organisation.\nThere are good reasons\nfor this. You need people\nto think well of you to\nsucceed. In the corporate\nworld, there\u2019s an obvious\nincentive: money. The\nsame applies to charities.\nIn politics, the currency\nis votes instead, but it\namounts to the same\nthing \u2013 you need people\nto give you some of what\nthey have, some of the\nappropriate currency.\nIn some cases that\ncurrency is the nebulous\nconcept of \u2018goodwill\u2019. In\nother words, you need a\nparticular community to\nsupport you in something.\nThis is often especially the\ncase with campaigns \u2013 on\nthe national scale, one can\npoint to an organisation\nlike Extinction Rebellion,\nor more locally we could\npoint to a little organisation called \u2018the student\nunion\u2019.\nTheunionneedsstudent\ngoodwill to be functional.\nThere\u2019s a financial aspect,\nas always \u2013 if students like\nunion events, they\u2019ll buy\ntickets, and the union can\nturn a profit. However,\nthat money is directly\nre-invested back into\nstudents and their activi-ties, so the real currency\nhere certainly isn\u2019t GBP.\nTo understand the need\nfor \u2018goodwill\u2019, you have\nto think about what the\nunion\u2019s goal is.\nIt is, predominantly,\nto represent students and\ncater to their needs. That\ncan be food or drinks, it\ncan be supporting clubs\nand societies, or it can be\ncampaigning or advocating for student rights and\nwelfare.\nIn the latter cases,\nstudent goodwill allows\nthe union to take a firmer\nstance, to put more\npressure on the College,\nand to organise larg-er-scale demonstrations\nof student opinion \u2013 from\nthe simple petition to the\ndrastic strike.\nIt\u2019s clear that to achieve\nits goal, the union needs\nstudents to believe in it\nand be on its side. Naturally, it has to earn that,\nand whether you believe\nin the union or not is a\nseparate discussion. What\nI want to discuss, though,\nis how this necessitates a\nstrong PR presence.\nThere is a marketing\ndirectorate within the\nunion \u2013 with which\nFelix, for the sake of\nclarity, works somewhat\nclosely regarding the\nUnion pages and adverts.\nThat\u2019s there for obvious\nreasons; the union needs\nmarketing materials for\nits events and campaigns,\nand needs experts to help\nrealise and broadcast the\nstudent voice. However,\nPR comes in at every\nlevel and every decision\nmade \u2013 not just within that\ndirectorate.\nAn interesting anecdote\nwas mentioned offhand\nat Union Council on\nTuesday \u2013 the Community\nand Welfare Board had\ndecided to propose the\nintroduction of a Working\nClass Officer. I can sense\nsome of you flinching a\nlittle bit at the name now,\nbecause discussing class\nis still a little bit taboo\nat times \u2013 especially for\nmany Imperial students,\nwho come from wealthier\nbackgrounds and risk\nbeing considered snobs.\nThis uncomfortable\nfeeling was raised by a\nfew people at the meeting,\nwho wondered if a better\nname was possible.\nAfter all, many people\nwho would not consider\nthemselves traditionally\nworking class would also\nneed to be represented by\nthis officer (hell, I was one\nof them, broke as can be.)\nA few options were\ndiscussed. Indeed, the\nmajority of the discussion\nwas about the name,\nand very little about the\nsubstance of that particular proposition. This\nis because everyone, it\nseemed, clearly agreed\nthat it was a good idea.\nIt was said that the\nCWB, on initially discussing the idea, had spent five\nminutes agreeing on the\nidea, and 30 minutes on\nthe name. The same sort\nof ratios were seen in the\nUnion Council meeting.\nThe proposition was voted\nthrough 32 to 1, with\noverwhelming support,\nalongside other Liberation\nand Community reforms \u2013\nbravo to the DPW for that\nvictory.\nHowever, it did get me\nthinking. PR is essential\nfor generating goodwill,\nand goodwill is essential\nfor achieving goals, and\nso one has to consider PR\nin every decision their\norganisation makes. Fine.\nI just sometimes wonder if\nmany of us, as the students\nwhose goodwill is being\nsought, are a bit too picky.\nWe\u2019re perhaps a little too\ndemanding of what we\nwill give our goodwill to.\nWearenotnearlysodiscerning with our money \u2013\nnor, in the broader world,\nour democratic right to\nvote.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nJANUARY, 2020 FELIX\n8\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy it Hurts to Know History?\nCommentwriterAmalAhmed thinksthatadeterministicviewofpasteventsleavesustrapped\nin a present not of our own creation\nCOMMENT\nAmal Ahmed\nComment Writer\nH\nistory is not a\nfield that possesses obvious\nsocial value.\nHistorians claim that the\nstudy of history allows\npeople to develop a sensitivity to cognitive biases\nand logical fallacies,\nimparting perspective,\nencouraging prudence\nand impelling social ad-vancement. However, the\nstrength of these claims\nis undermined by the fact\nthat history often fails to\nprovide any useful lessons\nat all.\nWhen history is\napproached from a deterministic perspective,\nwhere human independence of action is denied,\nhistory reinforces moral\nambiguity. It often does\nnot \u201crelate the right thing\nto do in one case or\nanother\u201d but exemplifies\nhow \u201ceven doing the right\nthing rarely works out.\u201d\nTo blur the boundary\nbetween right and wrong\n- good and bad - is to aggravate ethical quandaries\nand obscure moral judge-ments. This may subvert\ndecent or decisive action\nand threaten social justice\nand national security. Certainly, conflicting views\nabout whether \u201cwe ought\nto bomb these guys or side\nwith those guys we were\nbombing before,\u201d would\nundermine effective governance and public safety.\nSuch a complication of\nalready complex political,\nmilitary interventions may\nbe inimical to democracy,\nas well as domestic and\nforeign policy. This affiliation of history with moral\nambivalence negates the\nhistorian\u2019s assertion that it\nhelps to know history.\nThis sentiment is\nreinforced by the notion\nof history\u2019s variability.\nSome historians believe\nthat \u201chistory...teaches [us]\nthat it is hard...for anyone\nto control, including the\npeople who think they\u2019re\nmaking it.\u201d The deterministic interpretation\nthat the present is beyond\nhuman jurisdiction incites\na sense of powerlessness.\nThe implicit futility of\nindividual effort promotes\na culture of inaction and\ncomplacency. While\n\u201cstudying history doesn\u2019t\nargue for \u201cnothing-ism,\u201d\nthis interpretation inadvertently does. The belief\nthat \u201cthe best will in the\nworld\u201d and \u201cthe best candidates for our support\u201d\ncan\u2019t alter or better\nthe course of history.\nExamples of this are the\nattemptstomanageviolent\nunrest. The Mahdi\u2019s\nrevolt in Sudan against\nthe British was bolstered\nby efforts to erode it;\nMiddle Eastern terrorism\nwas amplified by attempts\nto eliminate it. The idea\nthat human endeavours\nto divert the trajectory\nof pressing social and\npolitical problems were\nself-defeating, furthers the\nargument that nothing can\nbe learned from history\nexcept that human actions\nare often pointless.\nThese premises conjure\nhistory\u2019s potential to\nexcuse recklessness\nand ineptitude. When a\ndeterministic attitude is\napplied to the reading of\nmodern events, it allows\nclear cut mistakes to be\ncharacterised as inevita-ble. For example, when\nconsidering the United\nState\u2019s many adventures\nin the Middle East, the\ncharacterisation of their\ninvasions can be described as inevitabilities,\nessentially \u201cuncontrollable,\u201d rather than heinous\nimmoral acts that should\nbe condemned. Such an\nattitude impairs the recognition and rectification\nof individual and official\nerrors. Thereby, the claim\nthat we are \u201cmade by\nhistory\u201d compels a passive\nspectatorship of the\npast, present and future,\nwhich stagnates personal\nand social innovation.\nThis is inconsistent with\nGopnik\u2019s claims of history\u2019s social utility.\nThe above advances\nthe fact that the utility\nof history is limited. A\ndeterministic view of the\npast leads to moral \u201chistorical blindness.\u201d The\nsuggestion that \u201chorrible\ngroups doing horrible\nthings,\u201d emerge as a result\nof the \u201ccertain things we...\ndo\u201d and \u201c[don\u2019t] do\u201dthat action and inaction\nalike inevitably result in\nchaos. Thereby, history\nis framed as a series of\nunruly inevitabilities. This\nmuddies the motivations\nof independent political\nactors. It divorces intent\nfrom outcome - Lyndon\nB. Johnson\u2019s orchestration of the Vietnam war\nfrom the \u201cmoral and\nstrategic\u201d atrocities that\nfollowed it. This renders\n\u201ccatastrophes,\u201d \u201cunintended consequences,\u201d\nand rationalises the juxtaposition of L.B.J with\nObama. This, in lieu of a\n\u201clack of historical sense,\u201d\nwould cloud humanity\u2019s\nview of the world to invite\nmisinformed civic choices\nand misplaced public rep-resentation. This portrayal\nof history and historical\nknowledge contradicts\nhis appraisal of its social\nfunctions.\nAccordingly, the\nargument against the\nreiteration of historical\nmistakes is antithetical\nto his conception of\nhistory. He maintains that\nhistory is \u201csingular\u201d and\n\u201cuncontrollable,\u201d but is\nincredulous that humanity\noperates in ignorance of\npast experience. Some\nhistorians claim that\n\u201cno matter how many\ninterventions are badly\nmade, the experts who\nintervene make more: the\nsixteenth-century doctors\nwho bled and cupped\ntheir patients and watched\nthem die just bled and\ncupped others more.\u201d\nThis does not demonstrate\nthat \u201cnothing works out\nas planned,\u201d but indicates\nan incapacity for effective\nplanning. That individuals\nand organisations re-com-mit the same errors, with\nthe benefit of hindsight,\nspeaks to an intrinsic\nhuman failing rather than\nthe forces of historical\nfate. This description of\nhistory is incompatible\nwith his appraisal of\nhuman behaviour. This\ndiminishes the purported\ninstructive value of\nhistorical knowledge,\nand hence, its value to\nhumankind.\nThis is furthered by\nthe assumption of historical illiteracy. Historians\nposits that the cultivation\nof a \u201chistorical sense\u201d\nis the solution to \u201cpresentism,\u201d or the assumption that the events of the\nmodern day are in some\nway special. However,\nthe deterministic attitude\nto history forces the\nassertion that \u201chistory is\npast, and singular, and the\nsame year never comes\nround twice.\u201d If historical knowledge is, thus,\n\u201cuniquely\u201d different, how\ncan modern day mishaps\nbe \u201cfamiliarly difficult?\u201d\nPainting past events\nas atypical, one-time\noccurrences vindicates\nthe centennial tendency\nto \u201cexaggerat[e]...present\nproblems out of all proportion to those which\npreviously existed. \u201d\nIndeed, this delineation\nof history\u2019s \u201csingularity,\u201d\nand uniqueness disputes\nits potential to act as a\nframe of reference for\ncurrent issues and, hence,\nalleviate \u201cpresentism.\u201d\nThis self-contradiction\nvitiates the validity of\nthe claim, about history\u2019s\npractical advantages to\nsociety.\nA deterministic view of\nhistory has the potential\nto entrap humanity in an\npassive, pacifist cycle of\nunresolvable social, political and moral disputes.\nSo, does it help to know\nhistory? Probably. But not\nwith the assumption of\ndeterminism.\nHistory is a map with no directions // Wikimedia\n\n"

If the American\ndemocracy were indeed\nas \u201cbroken\u201d as it is in\nRussia, Iran, or North\nKorea, I would agree with\nNasrollahi that its military\nwould pose a grave threat\nto world peace. But this is\ndecidedly not the case, for\nnumerous reasons. First,\nTrump\u2019s recent impeachment \u2013 even if it does not\nresult in his removal from\noffice \u2013 shows that the\nmechanisms of executive\nchecks are alive and well\nin the U.S. Second, I will\nsoon be mailing in an\nabsentee ballot to participate in the legitimate\nelections that occur in the\nU.S., nonexistent in those\naforementioned dictator-ships.

Moreover,\ndemographic changes and\nan ageing population are\nof big concern for policy\nmakers in the country.\nFor a long time, forecasts and predictions for\nthe economic health of the\ncountry had been bleak.\nHowever, some changes\nare starting to manifest\nthemselves now which are\nbeginning to transform\nthe Japanese economy\nand, coupled with the successes of the Rugby and\nOlympic competitions, it\nseems that positive times\nare ahead for the country.\nTo the Olympics and\nbeyond\nDuring the Olympics,\nan expected 8.4 million\npeople will visit Tokyo\nwith many more watching\non from around the world.\nThe Japanese government\nhave made it very clear\nthat they want to use this\nunparalleled exposure\nto advertise the culture,\nopportunities for invest-ment, and technological\nadvances that Japan has\nto offer, or \u201cmonozukuri\u201d\n\u2013 excellence in manufac-turing.\nSome important\ndebates will take place\nin Japan next year, most\nnotably the holding of a\nlong anticipated referendum on the role of Japan\u2019s\nmilitary and, increasingly,\nthose leading the country\nare discussing what role\nJapan will play in the\ninternational community\nin the future. On the\nsurface, demographic\nchange and an ageing\npopulation seem to be the\nbiggest challenges that the\ncountry faces. And whilst\nthis is true to an extent,\nthere are some other\nkey things which will\nchallenge the resilience of\nJapan\u2019s economy as well\nas force a reassessment\nof the role the country\nplays in the international\norder. Underpinning this\nis a need to cement the\neconomic growth the\ncountry has seen in the\npast few years and ensure\nits future prosperity by inculcating greater changes\nto the social and economic\nattitudes of its people and\nbusinesses.\nAbenomics\nPrime Minister Abe\u2019s\neconomic policy, which\nis commonly referred to\nas \u201cAbenomics\u201d, has a\nthree-pronged approach.\nIn order to stimulate an\neconomy that was defla-tionary for many years,\nShinz\u014d Abe has focused\non increasing the nation\u2019s\nFELIX\nmoney supply, fiscal\nstimulus, and structural\nreform to make Japan\u2019s\neconomy more competitive on a global stage.\nWhen Abe become Prime\nMinister for the second\ntime in 2012 he declared\nthat he would \u201cimplement\nbold monetary policy,\nflexible fiscal policy and\na growth strategy that\nencourages private invest-ment, and with these three\npillars, achieve results.\u201d\nTo a large extent these\npolicies have been suc-cessful, providing a steady\nrate of inflation, pushing\ndown unemployment to a\n22-year low of 2.4%, and\nhelping make Japanese\nbusinesses more com-petitive. However, in the\nlong-term this economic\nstimulus will be challenged as demographic\nchange in Japan becomes\nmore acute. The working\npopulation in Japan is\npredicted to fall from\n76 million in 2018 to 54\nmillion in 2050, whilst the\nproportion of those aged\nover 65 is set to increase\nfrom 28% in 2018 to 38%\nin 2050.\nAgeing Japan\nThe advantage of these\nsorts of demographic\nchanges is that they\nhave forced the Japanese\ngovernment and policy\nmakers to confront some\nof the underlying issues\nthat have held back the\ncountry\u2019s economy for\na long time despite the\nadvances made underAbe.\nIncreasing participation in\nthe workforce of women\nand foreign workers over\nthe last few years has\nhad a positive impact and\nthis looks set to increase\nfurther and further in the\nfuture.\nWhilst the increase\nin foreign workers and\na greater proportion of\nwomen working will\nhave cultural ramifications in Japan, it should\nhelp support the ageing\nworkforce. According to\nGraham Smith, a market\ncommentator at Fidelity,\nthis opening of the doors\nto foreign blue-collar\nworkers could be a \u201cgame\nchanger\u201d for the Japanese\neconomy.\nThe Japanese Market\nDiving deeper, the\nmake-up of Japan\u2019s stock\nmarket is also changing.\nTypically viewed as\nvery expensive, value\ninvestors have been put\noff the Japanese equities\nmarket due to comparably high P/E ratios and\ndividend yields, but this is\nchanging.\nThese sorts of metrics\nare now much more\nin-line with the US stock\nmarket, which makes it\nI\nn the latter part of\n2019, Japan finished\nhosting the Rugby\nWorld Cup. I\u2019m sure\nthose who watched any\nof it would agree that it\nwas a verifiable success,\nand for nearly two months\nthe country was at the\ncentre of the sporting\nworld. After the success\nof this rugby competition,\nJapan now looks towards\nthe Olympics this year\nfor another chance to\nshine.

    "content": "The One Where They Robbed a Bank\nT\nhe premise of \u201cA\nComedy about a\nBank Robbery\u201d\nis quite simple;\na couple of criminals\nbreak out of prison to try\nand rob Prince Ludwig\nof Hungary\u2019s diamond,\nwhich is being kept in a\nMinneapoli bank. Why\nwould the diamond be\nthere? I can\u2019t say I\u2019m\nquite sure. Not much of\nthis play makes sense\nanyway. This play is more\nabout the comedy than\nthe bank robbery and thus\ncheap laughs are definitely\nfavoured over a rock solid\nplot.\nThe first act, and\nespecially the opening\nscene, is a bit of a shock.\nFor audience members\nnot entirely sure what\nto expect, the humour\nseems a bit cringe at first.\nQuickly, it is made clear\nthat neither the writers\nnor the actors have taken\nthemselves too seriously\nand that the humour is not\nalways high brow. Lots of\npuns and slapstick humour\nare used with a Friends-esque amount of situational\nirony. However, this does\nnot mean that it can\u2019t be\nappreciated. Sometimes\nthese jokes are ruined\nby being drawn out a\nlittle bit too much, and\njust when you think it\u2019s\nover, the performers\nkeep going! The first half\ndefinitely had many more\nof these unfunny, drawn\nout sequences but as the\naudience gets used to\nthem, the second half flies\nby!\nAshley Tucker\u2019s portrayal of the classic 1960s\nmother with a bit of a fiery\nside is brilliant. Every\nscene that she was in, I\ncould not take my eyes off\nof her performance. Her\ncomedic timing, hilarious\nmannerisms and overall\nattitude guarantee the\nbiggest laughs from the\naudience. If that is not\nenough, she also sings\nthe most, and the most\nbeautifully, during the\nfew musical moments.\nThese choreographed\nmusical pieces usually\ntake place whenever there\nis some major action: a\ncar chase for example.\nWith the impeccable\nchoreography and the fun\nswinging beats, the show\nsuccessfully builds up ex-citement. These musical\nmoments also add to the\nhilarity of the whole play.\nI wish there were more\nof these unique gems,\nwhich are reason enough\nin themselves to come and\nsee the play.\nAnother high point is\none of the final scenes,\nwhere the stage is flipped\nright on its side with the\nfloor becoming the back\nof the stage. Hilariously,\nthis mind boggling,\ngravity defying setup is\ndefinitely not essential\nfor the performance and\nis almost put there as a\ncurve ball to the actors to\nsee how they cope with\nthe new situation. With\nactors harnessed up, they\ncomically make their\nway across the stage and\nperform gravity defying\ntasks. I have to say it took\nme a few minutes to even\nunderstand how it was all\nworking and which way\nwas up.\nOverall, the performance feels a bit like an\nold Friends rerun and is\ntired in parts but hilarious\nin others. There is also\nan improvised feel to the\nshow, not that it is, and\nthe audience finds the\njokes funnier and funnier\nas they get to know the\ncharacters and actors. If\nyou want a bit of laugh\nand to see a stage flipped\non its side this is definitely\none to see!\nWelcome to West Egg, Old Sport\nI\nn addition to being\none of the great\nAmerican classics,\nThe Great Gatsby\nis also a novel that I feel\nstrongly attached to,\nhaving analysed it to death\nfor my English Literature\nGCSE. Instead of forming\nan adverse reaction to\nGatsby, I was surprisingly\ntaken aback by its depth,\nand its exploration of\nuniversal themes through\nthe lens of the American\nDream.\nWith this in mind,\nyou can imagine my\nexcitement when I heard\nabout this immersive\nproduction. I hoped it\nwould allow me to be\nimmersed in the world\nof Gatsby, help me relate\nto the circumstances and\nthe challenges of 1920s\nAmerica, and fall deeper\nin love with the book I\u2019ve\nheld onto dearly for years.\nThis immersive production is wildly fun.\nFrom the moment you\nenter the venue, you are\ngreeted by enthusiastic\nstaff with American\naccents, dressed fully in\n1920s attire. The d\u00e9cor\nsurrounding the entire\nroom is hidden behind\ncurtains. However, there\nis a bar, which is fully\nglammed up in true\nGatsby fashion, serving\nthemed cocktails. As the\nplay starts, the curtains\nfall to reveal Gatsby\u2019s\nfancy pad, complete with\nmonograms reading JG\n(Jay Gatsby), fountains,\nand a grand piano.\nFromtheget-go,thecast\ndoes a commendable job\ninvolving the audience,\nchatting everyone up and\nteaching a fun Charleston\nroutine, which they ask\nthe audience to engage in\nvarious times during the\nplay. The cast is charming\nand they bring these iconic\ncharacters to life with an\nauthentic flair. However,\nthe transitions between\nscenes feel tacky at times,\nwith the cast simply\nasking the audience to\nmove themselves from\none side of the room to\nthe other with not much\nreason or explanation.\nThe main problem with\nthe production is the fact\nthat a significant effort has\nbeen put into making sure\nthe immersive experience\nis fun, that the depth of the\nnovel has been reduced to\na mere shadow of itself,\nand instead replaced\nwith quippy one liners.\nGone are the subtexts and\nintricacies that made the\noriginal manuscripts so\ngreat. Instead we burst into\nour dance routine to amp\nup on the \u2018immersiveness\u2019\nof the production. Rather\ncuriously, however, by\nthe second act, the play\nkind of gives up on its\nidea of making Gatsby\nimmersive, letting the\naudience sit all around the\nroom and simply watch\neverything unravel.\nOne thing that\nconfused the hell out of\nme was seeing the cast\nmembers escort random\ntheatre-goers into a side\nroom for large chunks of\ntime, at some of the most\nimportant points of the\nplay, no less. I was never\nlucky enough to be chosen\nto experience whatever\nwas in the side room, but\nI can\u2019t help but wonder\nwhat might be going on\ndown there that would\nmake up for missing out\non the actual plot.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a\nchill night at the theatre,\nI would say this isn\u2019t the\nright play for you, as it is\noften hectic, tiring, and at\nall times, way too crowded\nto be fully enjoyable.\nOn leaving, you do feel\nimmersed in the world of\nJay Gatsby, perhaps more\nthan you would through\na regular play. However,\nI am just not sure if this\nmakes up for the lack\nof depth and substance\nwhich play a considerable\npart in making the novel\nthe work of art is truly is.\nThe star of the show, Ashley Tucker (right), brings an angry seagull to life // Robert\nDay\nISSUE 1740\nFELIX\n17\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Hence, investors traditionally expect\nhigher rates on longer\nterm bonds to compensate\nfor the increased risk\nmeaning the yield on\nhigher maturity bonds\ntends to be greater which\nyou will see below for the\nhealthy years of 2011 and\n2018.\nOn the other hand,\nwhen investors fear a\ngloomy outlook, they tend\nto position themselves\nwith longer term safe\nassets such as government\nbonds rather than say the\nstock market re\ufb02ecting\na short-term pessimism.\nWhen the demand for such\nbonds is high enough, the\nyield on long term bonds\nwill decrease below that\nof short-term bonds which\nis what is known as an\ninversion seen Figure 2\nfor the years 2000 and\n2007 where the gradient\ndecreases below zero.\nAdditionally, on Figure 1.\ndisplaying the difference\nbetween yields on 10-year\nversus three-month bonds\nyou will see that it goes\nnegative prior to each\nrecession signifying that\nat those points, returns on\n10-year bonds are lower\nthan those of 3-month\nbonds.\nHowever, few economists believe this sort of\nspeculation itself guarantees a slowdown but\nFELIX\nrather that a slowdown is\ncaused by a culmination\nof central banks raising\nrates in the short term to\nkeep the economy from\noverheating and investors\nfearing slower growth so\nmoving to longer term\npositions.\nThe Federal Reserve\nof the United States as\nwith any central bank is\nresponsible for managing\ncurrency, monetary supply\nand importantly, interest\nrates which affect the\ncost of borrowing money.\nGenerally, the FED can\nbe extremely slow to\nreact and alter rates especially to the yield curve\nwhether that\u2019s caused by\nlayers of bureaucracy or\nsimply a skepticism of the\nindicator. However, the\nFederal Reserve unusually abandoned its policy\nto continue raising rates\nthis year and instead cut\nthem from 2.4% to 1.55%\nin line with what the yield\ncurve was suggesting.\nInterestingly, the move\nweakened the omen-ness\nof the yield curve because\nit\u2019s no longer an independent analysis of economic\noutlook but rather a piece\nof data the FED uses to\nin\ufb02uence policy.\nFortunately, the yield\ncurve has since reversed\nW\nhat do you\nget when\nG D P ,\ni n c o m e ,\nemployment, manufacturing and retail sales\nexperience a decline over\nsix months? A recession-where growth is negative\nover two consecutive\nquarters. We all remember the \ufb02abbergasted\ninvestors, underwhelmed\nexecutives and even the\ndistraught homeowners\nlosing their livelihoods as\na result of the so-called\nGreat Recession of 2008.\nYet, what if there had\nbeen an indicator that\nhad correctly predicted it\n\u201c... what if\nthere had\nbeen an\nindicator that\nhad correctly\npredicted it\nabout a year in\nadvance \u201d\nNegative spreads between the 3 and 10-year bonds are signalled by the graph dipping below the zero line . Conventional wisdom argues\nthat this is a sign of investors having a pessimistic outlook for the short term //Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nitself, but by no means\ndoes that sound the all\nclear; a simple explanation could be that the\ninversion was caused by\na false alarm in the investment community with\nfears such as US-China\nrelations and Brexit\nmounting. However, a\nmore cautious perspective\ncould be that we are yet on\nthe road to the next reces-sion. In fact, the last three\neconomic recessions all\ncompleted a full reversal\nbefore collapsing a year or\nso later so the bullet may\nstill be on the way.\nabout a year in advance.\nIn fact, this powerful economic omen is called the\nyield curve and it actually\ninverted without fail prior\nto every recession since\nthe 1950s, except once:\nAugust of 2019, as seen\nin Figure 1. The graph\ncommonly known as the\nyield curve is actually the\nUS Treasury yield curve\nwhich simply put, gives\nthe yield of a bond plotted\nover varying maturities\nwhere yield is the \ufb01xed\ninterest of that bond divided by its price. A bond is a\nloan to the government or Bond yields plotted against different maturities at 4 points in the past 20 years // Federal Reserve Economic Data\n\n"

I was\nborn in, grew up, and\nwent to college in the U.S.\nbefore finding myself\nin this other Western\ndemocracy embroiled in a\npolitical mess.) Certainly,\nPresident Trump\u2019s past\nactions in the foreign\npolicy sphere have been\nquite forward, from his\nca\u2019s, and to think that that\ncountry could legitimately\nhope to win a direct war\nagainst the United States\nis far-fetched, at best.\nInstead, the U.S. military\u2019s targeted attack on\nthis Iranian general can\nbe seen as a successful\ndeterrent action, of a su-War as an example, but\nI need not remind him\nor Felix\u2019s readers that\nthe actions of the Iraqi\ndictator Saddam Hussein\ntowards Iraq\u2019s neighbor\nKuwait, which in many\nways prompted the U.S.\ninvasion, were themselves\nextremely aggressive and\nconflict-inducing, with\nHussein actually invading\nthat country to seize its\noil fields. Yes, the suspicions that Hussein was\nharboring or developing\nweapons of mass destruction turned out to be\nincorrect, but this should\nnot mask the fact that in\nthis case, the U.S. was in\nmany respects not the first\naggressor in the Iraq War.\nNasrollahi attempts to\ninstigation of a trade war\nwith China, brinksmanship with North Korea,\nand decision to move the\nU.S. embassy to Jerusalem, among others.\nNonetheless, I find Nasrollahi quite unconvincing\nwhen he concludes from\nthis action, and other\nAmerican military actions\nin the recent past, that\nthe U.S. is \u201cthe greatest\nthreat to world peace\u201d\ntoday. First and foremost,\nI would point out that\nTrump\u2019s strategy of\nbrinksmanship need not be\nas much a threat to peace\nas Nasrollahi \u2013 and many\nothers in the media \u2013 make\nit seem. Unsurprisingly,\nworries about World War\nIII trending on the internet\nturned out to be completely bogus and overreactive,\nand I would offer a reason\nwhy Trump\u2019s action did\nnot come close to precipitating any such conflict.\nSimply put, Iran\u2019s military\nand economic capacities\nare no match for Ameri\u201cI share\nNasrollahi\u2019s\nsentiments\nthat the\nactions of the\ncurrent U.S.\npresident\nare often\nreckless...\nperpower against a minor\none, rather than an action\nthat necessarily produces\nconflict, or even comes\nclose to it.\nTo go further, one could\neven point to historic\nexamples where just\nthe opposite of Trump\u2019s\nactions \u2013 namely, appeasement \u2013 have facilitated\nconflict. Most recently,\nmany around the world\nhave actually criticized\nthe U.S. and other Western\npowers for not intervening\naggressively enough in\nSyria to prevent the civil\nwar there, arguing that if\nthey had maintained the\n\u201cred line\u201d that former\nPresident Barack Obama\ndeclared, lives would\nnot have been saved in\nthat region. To go a bit\nfarther back in history,\nI need not remind U.K.\ncitizens of the results of\nthe appeasement of Adolf\nHitler in the lead-up to the\nSecond World War. Here,\nPrime Minister Neville\nChamberlain\u2019s weak\nstance against Hitler,\nmany historians point\nout, facilitated Hitler\u2019s\ntakeover of Czechoslovakia. I do not bring up these\nexamples to necessarily\nsupport Trump\u2019s actions\ntoday, but merely to point\nout that they are not as\nmuch a threat to peace as\nNasrollahi leads readers\nto believe.\nAfter his description\nof Trump\u2019s actions,\nNasrollahi proceeds to\ndescribe in detail the great\namount the U.S. spends\non defense, without\nactually explaining why\na large U.S. military force\nin itself creates a threat to\npeace. Setting aside for\na moment the important\nand acknowledged deterrent capacity played by\nNATO, which the U.S.\ncontributes significantly\nto but Nasrollahi does\nnot mention once, the\nexamples he draws from\nthe politics of the Middle\nEast to try to show how\nthe U.S. military is such\na threat are dubious at\nbest. He first uses the Iraq\n10\nIn response to an article two issues ago titled \u201cIs the U.S. a Threat to World Peace?\u201d Gabriel Lipkowitz argues\nagainst the claims made by the other writer.

As I mentioned above,\nmany have criticized the\nU.S. for not getting more\ninvolved to prevent the\nhorrific bloodshed in this\ncountry. Whether the U.S.\ngets involved to prevent\nMiddle East atrocities or\ndoes not, it is either way\nimperialistic and a threat\nto world peace, according\nto Nasrollahi!\n\n"

Aside from\nthat, I just enjoy doing my\nown thing. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll\ndie down soon \u2013 it\u2019s just\nhype, memes come and\ngo.\nFelix: So you started\ndoing this just a few\nweeks ago \u2013 have\nyou begun rhythmic\ngymnastics recently,\nor is this something\nyou\u2019ve been doing\nfor some time?\nZL: I only got my first\nset of ribbons maybe two\nmonths ago \u2013 in November. I didn\u2019t even know\nit had a name until after-wards. I\u2019m not professionally trained in rhythmic\ngymnastics or dance,\nI\u2019m literally just making\nthings up as I go! I\u2019m a DJ\nand I like listening to good\nmusic, a lot more than the\naverage person. I just feel\nlike moving \u2013 I gotta keep\nmoving. Whenever I go\nout to clubs, whether I\u2019m\nworking as a DJ or not, I\nlike to dance to my own\nmusic. The ribbons were\na recent addition because\nI just thought it would be\nfunny.\nFelix: So you got into\nthis sort of randomly \u2013 why the Queen\u2019s\nLawn, just for practi-cality?\nZL: Yeah, I do need the\nspace \u2013 I do high tosses\ninto the air.

But\nI want it to be gradual,\nrather than making a\nsociety. At the end of the\nday, what I\u2019m doing is\nabout being your individual self, and not having to\nfollow a certain set of patterns or rules.

I help out\nwith the MechEng depart-ment, aiding students and\nsuch, and would say I\u2019ve\nbeen put into a leadership\nposition in multiple cases.\nThat\u2019s helped me become\nmore confident, and to\ncare less. Be a bit less\nstressed, take things as\nthey come.\nFelix: Do you think\nmore people at Imperial should push\nthemselves to get\nout there, follow this\nmentality of individuality and less stress\nyou\u2019ve outlined?\nZL: I don\u2019t know,\nbecause each person\nhas their own specific\nproblems and issues.\nThere isn\u2019t a \u2018one size fits\nall\u2019. But if everyone just\ncared a little less about\nthe standards that other\npeople have set for them,\nand to just go about setting\ntheir own standards, they\nwould be much happier.\nFelix: It would be\ngood to hear about\n\u2018the man behind Ribbon Guy\u2019. What\u2019s your\nstory?\nZL: I\u2019m Malaysian,\nand studied there for\nprimary school.

There\u2019s no doubt\nmusic is in Eilish\u2019s blood:\nher parents are both mu-sicians, and her brother\nFinneas is also musical.\nIn fact, her first single\n\u2018Ocean eye\u2019s\u2019, was originally written by Finneas\nfor his band. As legend\nhas it, after being asked to\nwrite a song for her dance\nclass, Eilish recorded her\nversion of the song with\nFinneas and put it on\nSoundCloud. From there,\nit blew up. The single\nitself has Eilish\u2019s iconic\nsoft vocals mixed with\nrelaxed beat and synths to\ngive a dreamy electro-pop\nsound. It\u2019s a great song,\nbut does it scream James\nBond? Definitely not, but\nEilish\u2019s development from\nthat initial single has been\nimmense.\nSubsequently to the\nsuccess of \u2018Ocean eye\u2019s\u2019,\nEilish was signed to\nInterscope Records and\nwas being interviewed\nby Vanity Fair at 15 years\nold; at 16 years old she\nwas named an Apple\nMusic UpNext artist after\nthe release of her first\nEP don\u2019t smile at me. In\nMarch 2019, the now\n17-year old Eilish releases\nher first album, When We\nAll Fall Asleep, Where Do\nWe Go? and the budding\nstar becomes a supernova.\nShe instantly broke the\nrecord for the female artist\nwith the most songs in the\ntop 100, after all songs\n(bar one) off the album hit\nthe charts, subsequently\nbecoming the first artist\nborn in the 21st century\nto have a US number\none album.

In the\nend, the \u2018Popular Front,\nthe electoral alliance lead\nby the PSOE, won the\nelections. Nevertheless, it\nhas recently been claimed\nthat this was a result of\nelectoral fraud. It has been\nasserted that the electoral\nrecords were manipulated\ngiving over 70.000 votes\nto the \u2018Popular Front. This\noutcome led to a fraudulent absolute majority of\nthe socialist forces and\ngave rise to persecution of\npolitical dissenters and the\nCatholic Church by militia\nthe crowd. The murder\nof the conservative leader\nof the opposition Jose\nCalvo Sotelo, by the is\nconsidered the \u2018casus beli\u2019\nfor the military uprising\nthat lead to the civil war.\nOn the 1st July 1936 an\nMP of the PSOE said\nto Jose Calvo Sotelo:\n\u201cThe violence might be\nlegitimated. In your case,\neverything is legitimated,\nincluding an attack ending\nwith your life\u201d. On the\n13th of the same month\nat 3.00 am 1936 Calvo\nSotelo, who had previously received death threats,\nwas illegally arrested by\nLuis Cuenca, a socialist\nmilitant and bodyguard\nof the above mentioned\nsocialist MP Indalecio\nPrieto. He was forced\ninto a van and then shot\nand killed. Five days later\nFranco\u2019s military uprising\ntook place, leading to the\nSpanish Civil War, where\n120,000 people lost their\nlives. Therefore, it is a\ndictatorship until 1977\nwhen the party was le-galized, one of their first\nactions was requesting an\namnesty for prisoners belonging to terrorist group\nETA, a Basque separatist\norganisation.\nWith no doubt, the most\nembarrassing event in\nthe history of the PSOE,\nwhich occurred between\nthe years 1983 to 1987\nduring the government\nof the socialist Felipe\nGonzalez, was the dirty\nwar against the ETA and\nthe establishment of the\nGAL (Antiterrorist Liberation Groups). This was a\ndeath squad aimed to kill\nthe leaders of the ETA, but\nalso resulted in the deaths\nof 10 innocent people. It\nwas later proven at trial\nthat the GAL was led and\nfinanced by the Spanish\nInterior Ministry and the\nformer socialist president\nFelipe Gonzalez. In any\ndeveloped country, as you\ncan imagine, this would\nforces.

Two\nfurther meetings were\nheld before the Christmas\nbreak \u2013 at the latter of\nwhich, it was agreed that\ncertain information would\nbe passed on to the Union.\nA significant portion\nof that information, the\nUnion President says,\nnever arrived.\nA revised deal was\nthen proposed, in which\nthe rise in rent would be\n\u2018smoothed\u2019 \u2013 instead of\n12.2% followed by 2.5%\nevery year, it would be a\nflat 5.5% increase every\nyear. This would result\nin lower rents than the\nprevious model for the\nyears 2020-2023, but\nhigher rents for 2023-25,\nand still used the same financial model the Council\nhad criticised.\nTo address this, the\nmost recent offer was\nthat the lowest point of\nthe curves for each of\nthe two proposed models\nwould be taken \u2013 in other\nwords, a 5.5% increase for\nthe years 2020-2023, and\na 2.5% increase for the\nUnion Council Rejects College\u2019s Revised Rent Model\nISSUE 1740\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe College and Union\u2019s negotiations resulted in a revised deal based on the same \u201cbreak-even\u201d financial model;\nUnion Council rejected the proposal on the same basis as in December. Rent strikes have been proposed\n\u201cThe inflation\noffset of 2.5%\nper year is\nsignificantly\nabove the\n2019 rate\nof inflation\n(1.8%)\u201d\nwhich was the cause for\nthe initial rejection, had\nnot been re-assessed, and\nrequested information\nhad not been provided.\nAlthough the reduction\ncould be viewed as a\ntoken \u2018win\u2019, the Council\nhad mandated itself in\nDecember to oppose the\nfinancial model proposed\nby College, and so only a\nrejection was considered\nappropriate.\nA College spokesperson said:\n\"We don\u2019t believe we\nshould make either a\nsurplus or a loss on student\naccommodation. Running\nour halls at cost means we\nwill be able to renew our\nfirst-year undergraduate\naccommodation at the\nappropriate time, so future\ngenerations of students\ncan have access to similar\nfacilities and support\nservices.\n\"It is also important\nthat we ensure rent for our\nfirst-year undergraduate\nhalls is lower than accommodation of a similar\nstandard in the open\nmarket and other comparable London universities,\nand we carried out a\nbenchmarking exercise to\nmake sure of this.\n\"The proposed rents\nare in line with the New\nLondon Plan as approved\nby the NUS which says\n35% of new student accommodation should cost\nno more than 55% of the\nmaximum maintenance\nloan provided by Student\nFinance England. There\nare also cheaper beds\navailable in a variety of\nlocations to reduce the\ndisparities in rent between\ndifferent halls.\"\nAfter the vote, conversation at Council turned\nto discussion of \u2018next\nsteps\u2019. While many were\nin support of further\naction \u2013 whether to raise\npetitions or act via some\nother campaign \u2013 the conversation took a cold turn\nwhen the mention of rent\nstrikes naturally arose.\nRent strikes at universities have previously\nproven to be effective. In\n2016, students at Goldsmiths, Roehampton, and\nUCL engaged in a rent\nstrike costing around \u00a31\nmillion in revenue. This\nresulted in a rent freeze,\nas well as an increase\nin the accommodation\nbursary. However, they\nalso come with risks.\nThe College can legally\nevict students for not\npaying rent \u2013 though this\nis relatively unlikely, due\nto reputational risk for the\nCollege and prior strikes\nat other universities have\nnot resulted in evictions.\nIt also places a large\nburden on predominantly\nfirst-year students, going\nthrough exams for the\nfirst time, to represent\nthe views of students\ndetermined via a referendum available to students\nfrom all years. The latter\nconcern was the one most\nexpressed at Council.\nRepresentatives felt\nthey needed more time to\nprocess and consider the\nramifications of such an\naction. The student reps\nwill meet again in two\nweeks to discuss what\nthe Union should do next,\npending the outcome of\nfurther conversations\nbetween the College\nand the Union President\nand Deputy President\n(Welfare) \u2013 who will\nmeet with the Provost on\nMonday.\n\u201cThe offer was\npresented to\nUnion Council\non Tuesday\nand rejected\nin a vote of 29\nto 3, with two\nabstaining\u201d\nyears 2023-2025.\nDepending on the split\nbetween South Kensington and Acton halls,\nthis revised model could\nstill see halls in South\nKensington be priced at\nover \u00a3300 per week by\n2024. This offer was presented to Union Council\non Tuesday, and rejected\nin a vote of 29 to 3, with\na further two members\nabstaining.\nFeedback in conversation at Council was\nalmost unanimous \u2013 the\nfundamental model,\n3\nPembridge Hall, retired this year // Neville Miles, Imperial College London Asset Library\n\n"

I will only go\nover the U.S footprints in\nthe Middle East in the last\ntwo decades.\nAfghanistan\nSince the United\nState\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the\nU.S has spent 975 billion\nUS dollars on the war in\nAfghanistan. During the\neighteen years of their\npresence, the U.S military\nforces have dropped more\nthan 30,000 bombs on\nAfghanistan\u2019s soil. This\nhas caused the death\nof hundreds of Afghan\ncivilians every year. In\nfact, U.S air strikes have\nkilled more civilians in\nAfghanistan than terrorist\nforces. Despite all that,\nAfghanistan is still struggling with the presence\nof terrorists. It is hard to\ntell if the U.S invasion\nhas done the country any\ngood at all.\nIraq\nThe U.S formed a coa-lition, including the UK,\nto invade Iraq in 2003 in\nan attempt to overthrow\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s regime\nas he was suspected of\nhaving weapons of mass\ndestruction. Of course,\nno such weapons were\never found, and the claims\nwere found to be bogus.\nAlmost all countries in\nthe coalition including the\nUK came to the consensus\nthat the Iraq war was a\nterrible mistake. Not only\ndid it incur billions of\ndollars in cost, it ruined\na country, spread hatred\nand violence in the world,\nand caused the death of\nhundreds of thousands\nof innocent civilians.\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal, the commander\nof Joint Special Forces\nwho fought Al-Qaida in\nIraq, acknowledged that\nU.S military\u2019s presence in\nIraq was the motivation\nfor the Al-Qaida insurgents to migrate to Iraq in\nthe first place.\nSyria\nThere is plenty of\nevidence on how the U.S\nhad been planning to\noverthrow Bashar Asad\u2019s\nregime.

The civil\nwar in Syria eventually\nled to millions of refugees\nand a total civilian death\ntoll of more than one\nhundred thousand.\nWhen power, imperialism and failed democracy meet\nWhen power, imperialism and failed democracy\nmeet, it will create a state\nvery much like George\nOrwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 dystopia.\nA state that sees its right\nto run programs of mass\nsurveillance on its own\npeople.

    "content": "The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern\nBOOKS\nEleni Konida\nBooks Writer\nI\nknow a good book\nwhen I read it because\nit has managed to\nleave me inspired, or\nthoughtful, or feeling any\nkind of strong emotion\ntowards it \u2013 and that\u2019s\u2026\nfine. I will give it a three\nto four-star rating, maybe\nrecommend it to a friend\nthat would find it interesting and call it a day. I know\na great book when I read\nit when it has managed to\nleave me utterly, deeply\nand completely disorient-ed. I finished reading The\nStarless Sea less than one\nweek before my first exam\nand for a whole day I\nforgot to be stressed about\nit. Morgenstern\u2019s writing,\naccompanied with the\nvivid and very twilight\nzone-y scenery she\ncreated with it, feels like\na fever dream you know\nis absurd in its essence as\nyou experience it, but also\nis alarmingly vivid.\nThe Starless Sea\nfollows Zachary, a 25-year-old grad student.\nHe loves to read books\nhe borrows from the university library (which are\nunrealistically non-sci-entific), where one day\nhe finds an old, battered\nbook with no information about the author on\nthe cover, titled \u201cSweet\nSorrows\u201d, which doesn\u2019t\nseem to be registered in\nthe library. He decides to\nborrow it anyway \u2013 but\nhe is shocked to find out\nthat, amongst the many,\nseemingly unrelated short\nstories, there is one describing a day of his childhood in great detail. It\u2019s a\nstory of the boy he used\nto be, standing in front of\na mysterious door which\nhe ultimately decided\nnot to open \u2013 a door, the\nstory says, that would\nlead him to a place called\nthe starless sea. Unable\nto ignore this, he sets out\nto find more information\nabout this book, and the\nmysterious underground\nlibrary some of the stories\ndescribe, getting himself\ninvolved in something a\nlot bigger and older than\nhimself in ways he cannot\nyet imagine.\nThe Starless Sea is\nErin Morgenstern\u2019s\nsecond work \u2013 her first\none, The Night Circus,\nwas very well received.\nI have bought but not yet\nread The Night Circus to\ncompare but judging by\nhow much I enjoyed The\nStarless Sea, I think that\nthe hype around it was\nwell-earned. It checks a\nlot of the boxes that make\na good book \u2013 and if not\ngood, then at least worth\nreading. First of all, the\nstory in itself and the way\nit was told, struck me\nfrom the very beginning\nas incredibly unique. Each\nchapter of the main story\nunravelling in the present\nis interrupted by what, in\nthe beginning, seems to\nbe fragments of little alle\u201cWhat seems\nirrelevant at\nfirst becomes\nimportant part\nof the plot\nas the story\nunfolds\u201d\ngoric pieces of fairytales \u2013\nabout people and the lives\nthey have lived, time and\nfate and their tragic tale\nof love, and a mysterious\nowl king. These seem\nvery irrelevant at first, but\nas the story unfolds, they\nbecome a very important\npart of the plot \u2013 become\nmore than words on a\npage, or an insert that is\nthere just to set an aesthetically pleasing scene.\nFor a book as lengthy\nas this one is, the people\nwho are introduced\nwithin its pages are surprisingly few. The total\nnumber of people adds\nup to no more than 10.\nAll of them were very\nmulti-dimensional and\ninteresting \u2013 as everything\nin this book was; every\npart they played in the\nstory was very carefully\nplanned \u2013 none of them\nwritten as a plot filler or\nan easy way to earn diversity brownie points. What\nis more, Morgenstern\nmanaged to achieve the\nimpossible \u2013 creating the\nmysterious love interest, a\ntroubled guy with a dark\npast-type character while\nalso making him interest-ing, in a way that doesn\u2019t\nfeel too try-hard, edgy or\noverdone. I was more than\nimpressed.\nThe Starless Sea, as\nmost (if not all) pieces\nof storytelling art created\namount to today, can be\nbroken down in to tropes.\nHowever, to say that it\nboils down to the typical\notherwise not special\nprotagonist-saves-the-day\nclich\u00e9 plot would be\nbeyond unfair. It is in no\nway a story about, or of\nZachary \u2013 it is a story\n(one of the many) about\nthe starless sea, which,\nas all stories do, has a\nbeginning, a middle and\nan end \u2013 a story the reader\nis made aware that they\u2019re\nexperiencing only a part\nof.\nThis brings me to my\nnext point. Now, I am\noften very critical of open\nendings. It always felt\na bit lazy to me to write\nhundreds upon hundreds\nof pages just to end the\nbook on a very bleak and\nvague \u201cand they might\u2019ve\nsurvived, but nothing\nknows what happened\nto them after that, the\nend.\u201d tone. However, the\nexact fact that throughout\nit the reader is made to\nunderstand that they\u2019re\nreading about a piece of\na story that is connected\nwith countless others that\nhave already been written,\nand ones that have not\nyet come to exist, makes\nit feel wrong to say that\nThe Starless Sea had \u201can\nopen ending\u201d. All the\nlittle details that are left\nunexplained don\u2019t seem to\nmatter entirely that much\n\u2013 they\u2019re part of things\nthat have always been or\nthat haven\u2019t yet begun to\nunfold.\nIn conclusion, there is\nno way to coherently talk\nabout all the points and\nthe elaborate plots that\nintertwine and make up\nthe experience that is The\nStarless Sea. Reading this\nbook felt like a puzzle,\nwhose fragments individually mean very little and\ncould only be understood\nfor what they were when\ntheir neighboring fragments had also been put\ntogether.

The four-track\nEP is a dizzyingly sweet\nsynthpop concoction that\ncaptures Garrett\u2019s iconic\nsound. There are big choruses and playful verses,\nwhich make the whole\nalbum feel like a massive\ncelebration. Garrett said\nthat most of his music was\ninspired by the \u201860s &\n\u201870s Playboys, and so it\u2019s\nharder to tell if the bubbly\nlove song, \u2018Electric Love\u2019,\nis about love or drugs.\nSome critics have\ncompared B\u00d8RNS to a\n\u201chappier Lorde\u201d or \u201cOwl\nCity\u2019s music for cool\nkids\u201d but the album effortlessly blends elements\nof electro-pop, synth, psychedelic pop, and alt rock\ninto a highly danceable\nblend of catchy hooks and\neclectic, inviting orches-trations; making B\u00d8RNS\nthe it thing when it comes\nto indie pop.\nThe light pop \u2018Electric\nLove\u2019 is the first song on\nthe EP, and it takes the\nprize when it comes to\nproduction value, also\nB\u00d8RNS\u2019s vocals & songwriting make the song a\ncomplete masterpiece. It\nfeels like a heartfelt declaration until the song bursts\ninto a colourful chorus. It\ndoesn\u2019t quite feel like a\nlove song, but the song is\ndreamy and hook laden.\nAlthough Garrett has been\nvery honest in his music,\nas there are no hidden\nthemes, \u2018Electric Love\u2019\nfeels highly ambiguous.\nNevertheless, you would\ndefinitely sing along, and\neven Taylor Swift deemed\nit an instant classic!\n\u201810,000 Emerald\nPools\u2019, one of the singles\nfrom Candy, has an exemplary bass intro, which\ncoupled with B\u00d8RNS\u2019\nharmonies and high\nfalsetto wail set the tone\nfor the album, coloured\nwith the same retro vibes\nthat characterise his\nmusical style.\n\u2018Past Lives\u2019 is the third\nsingle on the EP. The song\nbegins with an a cappella\nportion of wonderful\nharmonies before a slight\nlull springboards into\npounding drums and bass.\nThe transition feels like\nsomeone \ufb02ipped a switch\nsomewhere, as if the\nlistener were hearing two\nseparate tracks rather than\none single song. \u201cLost\nlove is sweeter when it\u2019s\nfinally found\u201d is one of\nthe many verses that make\nGarrett an excellent poet\nand songwriter.\n\u2018Seeing Stars\u2019 is like\nthe Naked and Famous,\nPassion Pit, and MGMT\nhave been put into an\nice coffee and blended\ntogether, in H&M. It feels\nlike jubilant bliss on a\nsummer\u2019s day, something\nthat would put a smile on\nour face, no matter what.\nThe whole album feels\nlike it\u2019s thickly coated\nwith honey, and Garrett\u2019s\nsongwriting skills are\ngolden. The Michigan\nsinger looks and sounds\nlike he stepped out of\nVelvet Goldmine and\nhigh-fived Lana Del Rey.\nAnyone paying close attention to B\u00d8RNS\u2019 blend\nof synth pop will only\nexpect good things. On\nCandy, B\u00d8RNS delivered\nby all measures a collection of masterfully mixed\nsynth-fueled pop gems.\nVocals and clean songwriting would be the key\ndrivers here, with Garrett\nBorns\u2019 voice setting a\nsmooth tone throughout.\nHe\u2019s stellar on \u2018Past\nLives\u2019 and even better on\n\u2018Electric Love\u2019, a track\nwhere his voice oozes an\neffortless cool.\nGarrett\u2019s eccentric\nlilting tenor voice complements his psychedelic pop\nstyle perfectly. The retro\ntrack, with clever drum\nsamples and complex bass\nand guitar riffs, make the\nEP a pleasant musical ex-perience, but the melodies\ncould never overpower\nB\u00d8RNS\u2019 stunning vocals,\nwhich are the star of the\nalbum. His voice possesses an immense range and\na smooth, strong falsetto\nthat never sounds out of\ncontrol; he has a sound\nthat could easily become\niconic. The lyrics them-selves, already vivid and\nexpressive, seem all the\nmore sincere and emotional when carried by his\nvoice. True to its name,\nCandy is a satisfying\nlisten.\nAlbum cover // Interscope Records\nMUSIC\nFELIX ISSUE 1740\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\n\n"

For\nexample, during the 2004\nelection campaign they\nused the al-Qaeda Madrid\ntrain bombings, where\n193 people died and over\n2.000 where injured, that\noccurred three days before\nthe election as an electoral\nargument against the\nincumbent conservative\ngovernment.\nIn 2011, the PSOE\npressured the Constitutional Court to legalize\nthe political arm of the\nterrorist group ETA lead\nby Arnaldo Otegi, who\nhad been sentenced to\nprison for being part of\nthe terrorist group and\ntaking part in several terrorist attacks such as the\nkidnapping of entrepreneur Luis Abait\u00faa. This\npolitical arm of ETA was\npreviously banned by the\nSupreme Court but finally\nlegalized in the Constitutional Court with 6 votes\nin favour and 5 against.\nIn 2016 Pedro Sanchez,\nwhose doctoral thesis\nhas been accused to be\nplagiarized, won a motion\nof censorship against a\nfunctional government of\nMariano Rajoy with the\nsupport of the Catalan\ncoup perpetrators and with\nthose who have blood on\ntheir hands, the political\narm of ETA. The main\narguments for this censor-ship, that led to 3 years of\nunstable government, was\nthe corruption case of the\nparty of Mariano Rajoy\nknown as \u2018G\u00fcrtel\u2019, which\nsupposed a loss to public\nfinances of \u20ac120M. This\namount, although high, is\nless than a tenth of what\nthe PSOE was responsible\nfor losing\nAll in all, we can say\nthat the history of the\nPSOE is the history of\na criminal party, from\nits establishment to the\npresent day counting\namong its crimes death\nthreats, murders, coups,\nelectoral fraud, alliances\nwith terrorists and being\nthe most corrupt party in\nEurope. The logo of the PSOE // Wikipedia\nSpain\u2019s New Government: A Progressive Coalition\nPolitics writer Julio Perez gives insight on the outcome of the Spanish elections.\nPOLITICS\nJulio Perez\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhese past weeks\nmark a turning\npoint for Spanish\npolitics. After\ntwo general elections,\na majority was finally\nagreed in the parliament\nto form a government. The\nself-named progressive\ngovernment is a coalition\nof the Spanish Socialist\nWorkers\u2019 Party, or PSOE,\n(social democrats) and\nUnidas Podemos (left-wing), who have agreed\non a program based on\nsocial justice, democratic\nrights, and a sustainable\neconomy.\nThis government is\nthe result of the past\nNovember elections,\nwhich saw the rise of the\nfar right and a victory for\nPSOE that still did not\ngive them a majority. This\nled, in less than 24 hours,\nto an agreement between\nPedro Sanchez (PSOE)\nand Pablo Iglesias (Unidas\nPodemos); even though\nApril elections attempts to\nform a coalition had been\nfruitless. The partners\nstill did not sum up the\nrequired number of seats\nand had to unite with\nother smaller parties to\ngain a majority. These\nagreements made the PM\ninvestment ceremony\nthat followed one of the\nmost polemic in modern\nSpanish democracy, with\nright-winged parties rejecting the legitimacy of\nthe democratically elected\ngovernment.\nBroadly speaking, the\ngovernment\u2019s program\nis of a classic social\ndemocratic character. The\ncoalition is conscious of\nthe climate crisis with one\nof their main goals being\nto achieve zero carbon\nemissions by 2050 and\nthe implementation of\nthe UN\u2019s 2030 agenda\nfor sustainable develop-ment. Culturally, their\naim is to challenge the\nconservative paradigm by\nmaking policies that will\nsecure rights conquered\nby popular movements in\nthe recent years, such as\nthe feminist or LGBT+\ncollectives. In this sense\nthey have created the\nministry of equality and\nplan on reinforcing the\ngender violence law. On\nthe economic side, their\nfundamental axis is the\nrestoration of public\nservices and spending,\nwhich had been cut to\nminimums in the previous\nlegislatures, and defending workers\u2019 rights and\ntheir material conditions.\nThey have already started\nworking on this by increasing the minimum\nsalary, reinforcing trade\nunions, and regulating the\nhousing market in certain\nareas. Geographically,\nthe government\u2019s greatest\nchallenge is to deal with\nthe depopulation of rural\nareas, which they plan on\nsolving with the restoration of public transport\nand economic incentives\nthat will encourage migration to the countryside.\nThis is the first coalition\ngovernment in the history\nof Spanish democracy, the\nfirst one with members\nof Unidas Podemos, a\nparty born out of popular\nmovements, and the first\nelected left government in\nSpain in nearly a decade.\nAlthough the coalition\nmay not bring radical\nchange to the country,\nit serves as a historical\nreference for a period\nwhere the far right rises\nand the market \u201cfrees\u201d\nitself more than ever from\nthe hands of politics. As\ndeputy MP Pablo Iglesias\nsaid, \u201cpolitics is the art\nof riding contradictions\u201d\nand even though this gov-Pedro Sanchez, leader of the PSOE // Wikipedia\nernment will encounter\nmany, it will still try to\npose an alternative for the\npost-democratic spectre\nthat is haunting Europe.\n\u201cThese\nagreements\nmade the PM\ninvestment\nceremony\nthat followed\none of the\nmost polemic\nin modern\nSpanish\ndemocracy\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Onegin\nFix\nR\nussian literature is often\nunsuitable for\nshorter format\nreproductions. How could\none begin to fathom distilling the multiple facets\nof, say, Tolstoy\u2019s War and\nPeace into a single movie?\nEqually daunting is the\ntask of bringing to life the\ncomplicated characters of\nAlexander Pushkin\u2019s celebrated 19th century novel\nverse, Eugene Onegin,\nthrough a ballet. But this\nis what John Cranko has\nachieved (quite master-fully) in his ballet Onegin,\ncreated for the Stuttgart\nBallet in 1965, and staged\nby the Royal Opera House\nsince 2001.\nThe ballet is as much\nabout the eponymous\nOnegin as it is about\nTatiana and her internal\nstruggle to decide between\nduty and love. The story\nfollows Tatiana, a young\ngirl enthralled by romantic\nnovels, as she falls in love\nwith Onegin, a friend of\nher sister Olga\u2019s fianc\u00e9,\nLensky. Her affections are\nspurned by Onegin, who\ninstead chooses to flirt\nwith Olga and in doing\nso enrages Lensky to a\nduel ultimately leading\nto Lensky\u2019s death. Years\nlater, Tatiana and Onegin\ncross paths again. Upon\nseeing Tatiana, now\nmarried to Prince Gremin,\nOnegin realises his\nmistake and and declares\nhis love for her, only this\ntime to face disappointment with Tatiana sending\nhim away.\nNatalia Osipova, as\nTatiana, shines in the\nproduction and is equally\nconvincing as an adolescent girl in Act I as she\nis portraying a Russian\nprincess in Act III. Her\nportrayal of a charming\nyoung girl exploring her\naffections for Onegin is\none to look out for. Reece\nClarke, playing Onegin\nin his debut performance,\nbrings much grace and\nelegance to the role,\nwonderfully transitioning\nbetween emoting stoic\nindifference and regret.\nOther notable performances include Francesca\nHayward as Olga and\nMathew Ball as Lensky,\nwho are both remarkable\nin their roles. Hayward in\nparticular owns the stage\nin those few scenes that\nshe occupies.\nThe music, arranged\nby Kurt-Heinz Stolze\n(from works of Pyotr\nIlyich Tchaikovsky) and\nconducted by Valery\nOvsyanikov for the pro-duction, adds a breath of\nlife to the characters and\ntheir emotional conun-drums. The choreography\nby Cranko is stellar, with\nthe mirror pas de deux\nbeing a truly remarkable\nstandout to this day. The\nstaging, lighting and\ncostumes need praise\nas well, bringing to life\nthe beautiful settings of\nidyllic country life and\ngrand quarters of Russian\npalaces with much ease.\nIn summary this is a\nproduction that no ballet\nenthusiast should miss.\nPushkin\u2019s story, with a\nrare central female lead,\ndeserves revisiting in\ntoday\u2019s day and age. The\nproduction delivers in\nevery department and\nwhen the sum of the parts\nemerges by the end of Act\nIII, one is left speechless,\nmuch like Tatiana!\nJ\nulie Tsang\u2019s Fix is\na provocative tale\nabout a washing\nmachine repairman,\nKevin, and his battle with\nhis inner conscience as\nhe is forced to address\nthe crimes of his past by\ninteracting with a mysterious woman, Li Na, in her\ncrumbling house in the\nwoods. A cosy set-up in\nthe Pleasance Theatre, Fix\nis an hour-long morale\npiece delving into the\npsyche of the guilty.\nThe intimate seating\nand stage arrangement\nwith a broken washing\nmachine as the central\nprop gave the show an\nalmost immersive expe-rience. Starting off as an\namicable chat between a\nrepairman and the client\nand building to an acknowledgment of a dark\npast, the show oscillates\nfrom boring to mediocre\nas the conversation\nmeanders its way through\narguments about the\nnearest phone booth to a\npet dragon residing in the\ntop floor.\nFix is a ravishing\nliterary piece speckled\nwith symbolism, metaphors and East Asian\ncultural allusions. Unfortunately, this did not\ntranslate into an interesting performance and it is a\npity that the performance\ndoes little justice to the\npotential of the script. The\npace of the story takes\ntoo long to build up, with\nlittle flow into the charged\nclimax. It is only in the\nlast fifteen minutes that\nthe point of the play gets\nexplained, and by then it\nis already too contrived\nand disjointed.\nControlling this nar-rative, Tina Chiang (Li\nNa) comes off more as\nstrange and eccentric than\nan eerie, omniscience\nfigure. Feeble attempts\nwere made at raising the\ntension, the height of it\nwhen she steals Kevin\u2019s\ntools and seems to spike\nhis tea. But even then, the\ntension wasn\u2019t sustained\nfor any longer than a\nfew moments and neither\nof these actions seemed\nto extend the storyline\nwhatsoever. Mikey Anthony-Howe (Kevin) is a\nmore convincing repairman and helped the duo\ncarry the story.\nThe eminent element of\nthe play is a thought-pro-voking twist that begs for\nscrutiny of missed signs\nand symbols throughout\nthe performance. From a\nbroken washing machine\nsymbolic of an irreparable\npast which can now no\nlonger wash away blood,\nto Kevin, who becomes a\nhandyman and still can\u2019t\nfix his past, Tsang lays\nout crumbs throughout\nthe story hinting at the\nclimax. With the final\nrevelation (spoiler alert!)\nof Kevin being a perpetrator of a fatal assault,\nthe previously mundane\ndetails transformed into\nclues of his past and make\nfor a great discussion in\nthe tube on your way back\nhome.\nFix is an alluring story,\nbest just read.\nMikey Antony-Howe (Kevin) and Tina Chiang (Li Na) // Nicole Latchana\nNatalia Osipova as Tatiana // Tristam Kenton\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nJANUARY, 2020\n18\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nWhere?

Make Way for The Frobots As Robotics\nComes to Life\nScared of robots taking over their creators and destroying the world? With frog cells used to make the first\nliving robots, your nightmare may be one step closer to reality\nSCIENCE\nJulia Dabrowska\nScience Editor\n\u201c[the\nxenobots] are\nable to survive\nfor days or\nweeks without\nany additional\nnutrients\u201d\nS\ntem cells have exponentially risen\nin popularity for\na variety of uses,\npredominantly in the field\nof regenerative medicine.\nHarnessed to treat diseases including macular\ndegeneration, spinal cord\ninjury, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and skin\ndamage, amongst others,\nthe incredible potential\nof these cells comes from\ntheir ability to self-renew\nand differentiate into\nspecific cell types. While\nmost types of adult cells,\nonce damaged, cannot\nregenerate, or can do so\nonly in fixed states and\nconditions, stem cells can\ngive rise to many other\ncell types and can promote\nthe repair responses of\ndiseased or injured tissue.\nHowever, it now seems\nthat stem cells have\nbroader applications than\ntraditional regenerative\nmedicine. Last week, researchers at the University\nof Vermont and the Allen\nDiscovery Center of Tufts\nUniversity revealed their\nuse of stem cells, taken\nfrom African clawed\nfrogs, to create the first\nliving robots. The paper,\npublished in the Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences,\nnames these xenobots\nafter the species they are\nmade from (Xenopus\nlaevis). While robots are\nusually made from metal\nor plastic for strength,\nresistance, and durability,\nthese materials also carry\ndrawbacks, including\nharmful ecological and\nhealth-related side effects.\nLacking these same draw-backs, living robots also\npossess multiple other\nbenefits: in addition to\nself-renewal, and healing\ntheir own wounds, they\nalso disintegrate upon\ncompletion of their\nprogrammed task. Much\nlike any other natural\norganism, these xenobots\nwill die and decay at the\nend of their lifespan.\nIn the future, applications of these robots may\ninclude drug delivery,\nclearance of arterial\nplaques, location and\ndigestion of toxic or\nradioactive materials,\nand even removal of mi-croscopic-sized pollution\nfrom oceans.\n\u201cThese are entirely\nnew lifeforms. They have\nnever before existed on\nEarth,\u201d said Michael\nLevin, the director of the\nAllen Discovery Center\nat Tufts University in\nMedford, Massachusetts,\nto the Guardian. \u201cThey\nare living, programmable\norganisms.\u201d\nThe robots are largely\ndesigned by an algo-rithm, highlighting the\nprevalence and utility of\ncomputational techniques\nin biology. A computer\nprogram generates\nrandom 3D configurations\nof 500 to 1000 passive\nskin cells, and active, contracting heart cells, which\nare then tested virtually\nfor properties such as their\nability to move and propel\nforwards in a certain di-rection, aggregate around\nforeign objects, displace\nobjects, or a combination\nof these.\nThe heart cells in this\ncell mixture act like miniature engines, driving the\nrobots along for up to ten\ndays before death, while\nthe skin cells provide the\nformation of an organised structure. The most\npromising candidates are\nthen shortlisted, and used\nto make more similar\ndesigns, with the process\nrepeating for 100 genera-tions, until only a selected\nfew remain. These tiny\nrobots, of <1mm, are then\nfinally constructed in the\nlab, using skin and heart\ncells from the embryos of\nthe African clawed frogs.\nScientists\u2019 ability to\ncreate novel lifeforms is\ncurrently limited to genetically modifying existing\norganisms, or performing\ntissue engineering in\nvitro. Although synthetic organoids and 3D\nbioengineered scaffolds\nare the most promising\nendeavours, it is difficult\nto predict the behavioural impacts of these\narbitrary constructions.\nTherefore, the creation\nof these robots opens up\nnew avenues: while the\nrobots are currently very\nsmall, the ultimate plan is\nto scale them up and use\nthem as the first step in\ndesigning bespoke living\norganisms. Moreover, at\npresent, to keep the frog\ncells alive, the robots need\nto be placed in dishes of\nwater, they are then able\nto survive in these conditions for days or weeks\nwithout additional nutri-ents. By building these\nxenobots out of mammalian cells instead, it would\nbe possible for them to\nsurvive on dry land, and\nthey could be built using\nblood vessels, nervous\nsystems and sensory cells\n(to form basic eyes), increasing their complexity\nand hence applicability.\nAs do all experiments\nrelating to stem cells,\nthis research raises\nethical concerns relating\nto their use, but also the\nfact that future variants\nof the xenobots may\nhave nervous systems,\nand thus be selected for\ncognitive capability.\nQuestions about at which\npoint moral consideration\nshould be given to these\nbeings also arise \u2013 should\nthey be classified as living\ncreatures, or machines?\nHowever, despite the\ninitial thought one may\nhave (or may have had\nfollowing the subheading\u2026), it is unlikely that\nthese xenobots will pose\na threat to humankind any\ntime soon, as although\nthey demonstrate novel\nfunctions, they are little\nmore than simply an\naggregates of cells, with\nno capabilities of reproduction or evolution.\nIn addition to the\npreviously mentioned\napplications, the work\nalso intends to utilise the\nxenobots in helping scientists understand human\nlife. \u201cThe aim is to understand the software of life,\u201d\nLevin told the Guardian.\n\u201cIf you think about birth\ndefects, cancer, age-relat-ed diseases, all of these\nthings could be solved\nif we knew how to make\nbiological structures, to\nhave ultimate control over\ngrowth and form.\u201d\nAnd, who knows?\nMaybe, despite the horror\nstories of world domina-tion, rather than destroy,\nrobots will save humankind after all.\nEmbryonic frog stem cells used to make the xenobots // NY Post\n\u201c(...) the\nultimate plan\nis to scale\nthem up as\nthe first step\nin designing\nbespoke living\norganisms\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Students Should Use Mitigating Circumstances\nEditor-in-Chief Henry Alman makes the case for why every student who might have been\naffected by an issue should use mitigating circumstances \u2013 and not feel like they\u2019re \u2018cheating\u2019\nCOMMENT\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nE\nxams suck.\nThat\u2019s the\nbulk of my\nargument. There\nis an obvious aspect\nto their awfulness,\nwhich is the experiential one \u2013 people hate\ntaking exams. They are\nstressful, panic-induc-ing nightmares during\nwhich the flip of a coin\ncan decide your future.\nDid the lecturer ask\nabout your best or worst\ntopic? Who knows! Or\nperhaps your neighbour\ndecided to have a party\nlast night and you lost\nout on sleep. Well, enjoy\nalso losing out on your\n1st degree.\nIt\u2019s an uncontroversial statement to make,\nso I\u2019ll leave that there.\nHowever, there is a\nslightly more sinister\naspect to the discussion\nthat does bear eluci-dation: a somewhat\nexploitative one.\nThe failure of exams\nto accurately and fairly\nassess the abilities of\nstudents is well-doc-umented. Better than\nwell-documented, it\u2019s\ncommon knowledge \u2013\neven common sense.\nThe conditions do not\neven vaguely reflect\nreal-life conditions; they\noften test skills other\nthan the intended ones\nsuch as rote memory or\nshort-term focus; and\nthe arbitrariness of the\nconditions on the day\ndo not lend themselves\nto fairness and accuracy\nof performance assess-ment. There are a litany\nof studies backing this\nup, conducted over\ndecades.\nThis is precisely why\nperformance reviews in\nthe real world do not\nconsist of examinations.\nBecause examinations\nsuck.\nSo why are they still\nso frequently used as\nthe primary form of\nassessment for virtually everything we do\noutside any actual job in\nan actual career?\nThe simple answer is\nthat they\u2019re practical.\nIt\u2019s far easier to herd\nhundreds of students\ninto one room for a few\nhours, where they can\nbe overseen by just a\nfew examiners. Then,\nas gruelling as marking\nexams is \u2013 trust me, staff\nmembers and postgrads,\nI sympathise with you \u2013\nthey are faster to mark\nthan a more customised\nor project-based as-sessment, which often\nrequires supervision.\nWhat this actually\ntranslates to is that\nthey\u2019re cheaper to administrate effectively\nthan other types of\nassessment. And what\nthat translates to is that\nyour future is not being\ndecided based on factors\ngoverning you and your\nperformance, but rather\nby what is cost-effective\nfor the institution. Specifically, the institution\nthat you are paying for\na service, most often\nyour education or certification \u2013 whether that\u2019s\na drivers\u2019 test or an\nImperial exam.\nLet\u2019s put it this\nway: they don\u2019t give\nexams to PhD students.\nThey deliberately\nchoose not to examine\nthose students whose\ngenuine, real-world\nacademic ability on the\nprofessional research\nlevel is being tested.\nThey instead give time,\nspace, supervision, and\nresources to see what\nthey can accomplish \u2013\nalthough I\u2019m sure many\nPhD students would still\nlike to have more of all\nfour of those things.\nThere is so much\nto be said about that.\nHowever, it\u2019s a topic for\nanother article. What\nI want to discuss here\nis why this means you\nshould absolutely use\nmitigating circumstances (MC), even for minor\nthings.\nA lot of students are\nreluctant to use the MC\nsystem; some feel it\u2019s\nassessment.\nThe point of MC is\nto account for at least\nsome of the inherent\nunfairness of exams \u2013\nas outlined above, you\ncould be ill, tired, have\nsuffered a bereavement,\nany number of things.\nMC is not an \u2018extra\u2019, a\ntool for only the severely\nafflicted or the special\nsnowflakes to use; it\u2019s\nan integral part of the\nexam system, specifically there to account\nfor the how disastrously\npoor exams are at determining your real-world\nability.\nWithout them, the\nexam system is even\nmore meaningless than\notherwise \u2013 a measure\nof the wrong skills, and\na measure of whose\nneighbours were dick-heads the night before.\nSo use them. You\u2019re\nbeing exploited if you\ndon\u2019t. You are paying\nup to \u00a330,000 a year\nto learn and then to be\ncertified based on that\nlearning. The institution\nyou are paying to do\nso skimps out on that\nlast part, for the sake of\ntheir own convenience\nand wallets. If you\ndon\u2019t use mitigating\ncircumstances, consider\nthem an integral and\nnecessary part of this\nsystem, you\u2019re letting\nthem screw you and\npocket the change \u2013 and\nscrewing yourself over\nas well by cheating\nyourself out of the marks\nyou\u2019ve worked for.\nSuffering the exam slog unites students throughout the years... // Public Domain\n\u201cThe\ninstitution you\nare paying\nskimps out\nfor the sake\nof their own\nconvenience\nand wallets - if\nyou don\u2019t use\nMC, you\u2019re\nletting them\nscrew you and\npocket the\nchange\u201d\na version of \u2018cheating\u2019\nor \u2018making excuses\u2019,\nsome are embarrassed to\ndiscuss their problems,\nand others have their\nown reasons.

As is often the\ncase in physical sciences\nand engineering, certain\nassumptions must be\nmade. The main ones\ninclude that individuals\nhave full knowledge\nabout the goods available and make rational\npurchasing decisions, the\nnumber of buyers and\nsellers are in\ufb01nite and that\ngoods are homogenous,\ni.e. they closely resemble\ntheir competition. These\nmodels can lead to the\nformulation of theories\nabout various types of\neconomic events within\na given market. These\nhypotheses must then be\ntested in practice, through\nempirical research, which\ninvolves the collection\nand analysis of economic\ndata from real-world\nmarkets.\nMicroeconomics has\ngiven rise to several\ntheories which seek to\nexplain how the market\noperates. The most prominent ones are listed below:\nProduction Theory:\nIt seeks to explain how\na business decides how\nmuch it will produce of the\ncommodity that it intends\nto sell. A \ufb01rm must select\nthe appropriate combination of productive factors,\nwhich include land, raw\nmaterials, and human\nlabour, among others, for\nthis purpose.\nLaws of Supply and\nDemand: According to the\nLaw of Demand, provided\nall other factors do not\nchange, a higher price for\na commodity will reduce\nthe demand for it. The\nLaw of Supply states that\nthe supplied quantity of\na product will increase if\nthe price is increased.\nAs seen in the graph\nabove, the downward\nsloping curve of the Law\nof Demand intersects the\nupward curve of the Law\nof Supply at a single point.\nThat point is referred to\nas the equilibrium price,\nwhich allows the supplier\nto sell their product at a\nprice considered acceptable by buyers.\nMacroeconomics\nThe publication of John\nMaynard Keynes\u2019s The\nGeneral Theory of Employment, Interest and\nMoney in 1936 highlighted the difference between\nthe two \ufb01elds of economic\nstudy. It sought to explain\nthe effects of the Great\nDepression and in doing\nso, it demonstrated that\nmicroeconomic concepts\ncould not simply be extended in order to explain\nthe entire economy.\nMacroeconomics analyses\nthe behaviour of factors,\nsuch as the growth rate,\nunemployment and the\nGross Domestic Product\n(GDP) which in\ufb02uence\nthe economy\u2019s perfor-mance. GDP refers to the\nFELIX\ncollective monetary value\nof all products and services produced in a country in the span of a year.\nAchieving development,\nwhich will hopefully result into increased living\nstandards is considered\nthe main goal of this disci-pline. Macroeconomic research is divided into two\ntypes: long-term economic growth and the business\ncycle.\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic development\nis linked to an increase\nin the total production in\na country\u2019s economy. It\nis therefore essential to\ninvestigate which factors\nmay lead to a slowdown or\nan acceleration of growth.\nBefore the 20th\ncentury, macroeconomic\nanalysis regarding growth\nrevolved around qualitative arguments, such\nas those found in Adam\nSmith\u2019s An Inquiry into\nthe Nature and Causes\nof the Wealth of Nations,\nwhich formed the basis\nof capitalism. Since the\nstart of the last century,\nmacroeconomists have\ndeveloped formal mathematical models. Growth\nfrequently appears as\na function of available\ncapital, labour force and\ntechnical progress.\nThe term \u201cbusiness\ncycle\u201d refers to the\n\ufb02uctuations in economic\nactivity which may occur\nover a given time period.\nEach cycle comprises\nof six stages: At \ufb01rst,\nexpansion is associated\nwith a rise in income,\nemployment and production in an economy. At\nsome point, growth peaks,\nwhich is then followed\nby a period of recession.\nDuring that period,\nincome, employment and\ndemand levels decline.\nContinued contraction\nleads to the depression\nstage, which entails more\nbusiness closures as well\nas reduced investment into\nthe economy. The trough\nstage signals the end of\nthe depression, which\nthen paves the way for\nthe recovery stage. Due to\nlow prices, according to\nthe Law of Demand, consumers will begin to spend\nmore, which will lead to\nincreased employment\nand production levels.\nExit from the recovery\nstage marks the end of the\nbusiness cycle.\nMethods of\nMacroeconomics\nAs previously men-tioned, \ufb01nding the policies\nwhich will help achieve\neconomic growth is one\nof the primary goal of\nmacroeconomic studies.\nThis implies a certain a\nsubset of goals, with some\nof the most important\nones being:\nSustainability: The\ngrowth rate achieved\npermits increased living\nstandards without adverse\nenvironmental effects\nFull employment:\nAll individuals who are\nwilling and able to work\nhave managed to secure\nemployment, which does\nnot necessarily mean zero\nunemployment. Several\neconomists argue that a\ncertain rate of unemployment will always exist.\nPrice stability: Prices\nremain stable for extended\namounts of time. Low-to\nmoderate in\ufb02ation is\nconsidered ideal for promoting growth. In\ufb02ation\nmeasures how quickly\ndoes the price of goods\nin an economy rise over\na given period of time.\nLarge rates of in\ufb02ation\nare undesirable because\nindividuals will be able to\npurchase fewer products\nwith the amount of money\navailable to them, leading\nto a decrease in demand.\nExternal balance: The\nmonetary value of goods\nimported in an economy\nis roughly equal to the\nvalue of exports in the\nlong-term.\nMacroeconomists have\ndeveloped mathematical models to describe\nrelationships between\nM\ni c r o e c o -nomics and\nm a c r o e -c o n o m i c s\nconstitute the two main\nsubgroups of the social\nscience known as eco-nomics. Both disciplines\nare said to have risen from\n\u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d\nby Adam Smith, whose\nwork as a political philosopher has in\ufb02uenced\nmuch of the world\u2019s\neconomic policy choices\nsince the late 1700s.\nnumerous factors, such\nas in\ufb02ation, unemploy-ment, consumption, and\ninvestment, among others.\nThese models rely on\nassumptions similar to\nthe ones mentioned about\nmicroeconomic models,\nbut also on statistics about\nunemployment and GDP.\nComparison\nAs deduced from the\nde\ufb01nitions of the two\n\ufb01elds, scale is the main\ndifference between\nthem. Microeconomics\nfocuses on how economic\nevents in\ufb02uence the\ndecision-making of\nindividuals and \ufb01rms,\nwhile macroeconomics\nstudies their effect on the\neconomy as a whole. For\nexample, a shift in the\ngovernment\u2019s tax policy\nwould be of interests\nto economists of both\n\ufb01elds. A microeconomist\nwill observe the policy\u2019s\nimpact on producers\u2019\ndecision making, namely\nif they will increase\nor decrease production\nlevels. In contrast, a\nmacroeconomist will\nconcentrate on how this\nnew measure may affect\nthe living standards of the\ngeneral population, i.e. if\nthey will bene\ufb01t from this\nmove or stand to lose.\nConclusion\nAs already shown,\nboth microeconomics\nand macroeconomics are\nessential to understanding\nhow the economy reacts\nto changes in society. One\ncould argue that macroeconomics is much more\nprevalent as it shapes\ngovernment policy, which\naffects everyone in the\nend.\nHowever, they would\nbe wrong given the continued interaction between\nthe \ufb01elds. For instance, an\nincrease in house prices\nwould not only have an\nimpact on households\nand \ufb01rms, but also on the\ngreater economy, considering the large size of the\nhousing market in several\ncountries.\nThe underlying force behind all markets, the law of\nsupply and demand//Wdflake via Wikipedia\nMicroeconomics\nM i c r o e c o n o m i c s\nstudies how the behaviour\nof economic factors, such\nas individuals, households\nand \ufb01rms, affect the operation of the market. The\nmarket is de\ufb01ned as any\nstructure which enables\nthe sale and purchase of a\nproduct.\nIt is often thought of\nas a physical market, but\nthat is not necessary if the\nsellers and buyers choose\nto communicate remotely\nin order to complete the\ntransaction. When referring to the functioning of\nthe market, economists\nare mainly interested\nin the prices, supply,\nand demand for goods.\nThis \ufb01eld focuses on the\noperation of individual\nmarket places and how\nthey interact with each\nother, while disregarding\ntheir relationship with\nthe economy as a whole.\nThe important question is,\nhow do microeconomists\ndevelop their theories\nto predict the market\u2019s\nresponse to changes in the\nproduction process?\nMethod and Main\nMicroeconomic Theories\nM i c r o e c o n o m i c s\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nJANUARY, 2020\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\n1917 (2020)\nW\nhilst sitting\nin the\nc i n e m a\nw a t c h i n g\n1917, having sat through\nwhat felt like five minutes\nof film, I heard my watch\nbleep signalling it was\n21:00; but how could\nthis be, the film started at\n20:30? This swift passage\nof time is all too apparent\nin this war time drama\nfrom Sam Mendes.\nThe idea behind 1917\nseems as alluring as any, a\nfilm made to appear as one\ntake, set over the course of\nthe 8-hour journey of two\nLance Corporals as they\nmake their way through\noccupied territory. As\nsoon as I\u2019d heard about\nthis one take format of the\nfilm, I was immediately\ndrawn to the cinematographer who would be\nresponsible for this movie\nmagic, quietly hoping\nEmmanuel Lubezki (of\nBirdman) would be there,\nhowever in finding Roger\nDeakins, I was definitely\nnot disappointed.\nIn some ways the cen-trepiece of the film, this\none-shot format doesn\u2019t\ndisappoint. From winding\nsteady shots to shaky\nclaustrophobic moments,\n1917 seriously delivers\nan experience unlike\nmany others in cinema\nhistory. Comparing this\nto Birdman is in some\nways unfair, they\u2019re\nvery different films held\ntogether only by their\nformat, yet they\u2019re bound\nto draw comparisons, and\nso I will. In the same way\nthat Birdman\u2019s mirror\nscenes left me scratching\nmy head as to how they\ndid it, 1917 delivers in the\nsame spectacular fashion\ntoo, where the camera\nglides seamlessly over\nwater seen to be totally\nisolated, over terrain that\nlooks untraversable, and\nall while keeping our protagonists perfectly in shot.\nRoger Deakins is really at\nthe top of his game here.\nThe tracking shot not only\nserves as an extremely\nimpressive feat, but it also\ncompletely sucks you in.\nTime passes in this film\nlike no other, where the\nstringing together of shots\nblurs any concept of time\nyou have. This results\nin a really encapsulating\nfeeling that you feel you\ncan\u2019t miss; I was really\nwracking my brains as to\nhow people were able to\nleave to go to the toilet\nduring this film.\nThe one-shot aspect\nisn\u2019t even where the bril-the tiny, horrific details\nthroughout the journey,\nseen unapologetically as\nthe real hardships of war,\nare shown to us. It puts\nyou there in a way that a\nnormal lens just wouldn\u2019t.\nWe also have to mention\nsome of the gorgeous shots\nin the dusk and night-time\nscenes, where the colours\nreally melt into each other.\nThe blues at dawn are just\nphenomenal.\nWith a film that follows\nits protagonists for such a\nlong duration, there needs\nto be a great performance\nto carry the weight of the\nstory; this comes in the\nform of George MacKay\n(Schofield). While this is\nnot a showcase in extreme\nacting prowess, he does\nact as an excellent vessel\nthrough which the story\nis conveyed. He plays the\ncharacter honestly and\nplainly, letting the gravity\nof the situation and scenes\naround him fold in and\nencapsulate the seriousness and difficulty he\nfinds himself in. Neither\nintrusive nor underplayed,\nhe does an excellent job\nthroughout the film.\nNow all that I\u2019ve said\nso far indicates that I\nthought this a brilliant\nfilm with nothing at fault,\nbut even with all this\nbrilliance there is still\nsomething missing. Due\nto the fast paced nature of\nthe film, I was unable to\nfully invest myself in the\nstory; where everything\nwas happening so quickly,\nthere wasn\u2019t quite enough\ntime to fully flesh out the\ncharacters and something\nis left slightly hollow.\nThe brilliance of the cinematography in contrast\nwith the slight lack in\ncharacter development\nmakes the whole thing\nseem as almost an exercise\nin film, rather than a film.\nHowever, when reflecting\non the story and taking in\nthe context of the events,\nI\u2019m left battling with two\nthoughts: one in which\nthe film is accidentally\nhollow, and one where it\nis purposefully hollow.\nIf it is the latter, this film\nis perfectly showcasing\nthe hardships of war,\nwhere the fast pace and\nhorrific events combined\nwith lack of character is\na perfect description. We\nsee how impersonal and\nbrutal the events are, as\nwe\u2019re dragged through\nscene after scene of the\ndifficulties faced. An out-encapsulates the journey\nhe\u2019s faced.\nHaving seen the film,\none of the things that is\nplain to see, is that this\nwas just so brutal. I think\nthis too is where the significance in the name of\nthe film lies, 1917. The\nend of the film comes,\nand it almost feels like the\nwar should be over, but\nit\u2019s not. There\u2019s still over\na year of fighting to come\nand with it can only come\nmore of what we\u2019ve just\nseen. This snippet of the\nwar and how significant\nit felt for one person is\nfelt so strongly in these\nfinal moments that it\nreally does leave you to\nreflect on how much was\ngiven by those in the\nwar.

Where disputes\nwere raised, adjustments\nwere made.\nOne such adjustment\ncaused controversy in\nthe January 21st meeting\n\u2013 specifically, the voting\nmembership of the Education and Representation\nBoard (ERB) had been\nreduced to just nine, by\nremoving voting power\nfrom departmental repre-sentatives.\nThe reasoning behind\nthis was a further change\nthis year: that subcommittees of Council have\nthe ability to vote on and\npass policies, so long as\nthe remit of the policy\nfalls only under their\nown. Therefore, although\nboards such as the CWB\nand ERB have almost\nnever needed to vote in\nthe past, they will need\nto regularly now. Many\ndepartmental reps \u2013 particularly postgraduate\nreps \u2013 do not attend most\nmeetings of these Boards,\nmeaning that they would\nstruggle to reach quorum,\nthe minimum proportion\nof voters needed for a vote\nto be valid.\nSeveral Council\nmembers strongly\nopposed this change,\nciting the fact that the\nERB itself had discussed\nthe issue and agreed they\npreferred to keep departmental reps\u2019 votes earlier\nthis year. Alternate solutions were offered, such\nas adopting the Council\u2019s\nrule that missing two\nmeetings excludes you\nfrom voting.\nThe vote was indeci-sive, 10 members voting\nto accept the change, 17\nrejecting it, and 7 abstain-ing; the vote will run again\nat the next meeting.\nReports\nMost of the reports\n\u2013 from the constituent\nunions and sabbatical\nofficers \u2013 were relaying\nthe content of their papers,\nwhich are available on the\nUnion website.\n\u201cThe paper\nproposed the\nintroduction\nof Liberation\nand\nCommunity\nStudent\nNetworks ...\nand passed\nwith a vote of\n32 to 1\u201d\n\n"

This is an\nasinine decision which\nwill only spur further\nviolence in the world.\nThere are multiple\ndimensions to this event\nwhich makes one have\nsecond thoughts about\nwhether the U.S is helping\nto establish peace in the\nworld, or is itself the\nbiggest threat to world\npeace and liberal democ-racy. The events of the last\nfew weeks suggest that it\nis the latter.\nIn defence of the U.S.\nactions, U.S secretary of\nstate Mike Pompeo stated\nthat the assassination of\nGeneral Soleimani was an\nact of defence. The U.S\nsuspected that Soleimani was plotting attacks\nagainst U.S diplomats\nand soldiers, despite the\nlack of any evidence to\nback such claims. Does\nthis mean anyone can\ngo around killing people\nand justify it as an act\nof defence against unforeseen future attacks?\nWouldn\u2019t the world be\nchaos if everyone justified\ncrime that way?\nAdditionally, the\nmajority of U.S. congress\nmembers were kept in the\ndark regarding Trump\u2019s\ndecision to assassinate\nGeneral Soleimani. This\nis a clear violation of\ndemocracy for a decision\nwhich could have global\nand long-term conse-quences, not just for\nthe Americans, but the\nwhole human population.\nDemocratic processes are\nthere to put a check on\nexecutive power. When\nthey are not allowed to\nact, tyranny is the result.\nThirdly, as part of the\nNATO coalition in Iraq,\nthe British leaders were\nalso not informed about\nthe attack, an act which\nhas dragged the British\ngovernment into a matter\nthey did not consent to.\nLastly, the attack was a\nviolation of Iraq\u2019s sover-eignty, territorial integrity\nand international law. It\u2019s\nlike inviting your friend\nto your house and he stabs\nyour roommate because\nworld peace in the present\nand will continue to do so\nfor many years to come.\nThere are three main\nreasons for this (a) United\nStates by far has the most\npowerful military in the\nworld, (b) United States\nwants to have total control\nover the affairs of the\nworld, and (c) the crippled\ndemocratic system in the\nUnited States allows men\nlike Donald Trump to rule\nthe country. History has\ntaught us that too much\npower brings forth corruption and death. When\ntied with adventurism\nand a failed democratic\nsystem which puts people\nlike Trump in charge this\nsystem has the potential\nto be way more dangerous\nto humanity than anything\nelse.\nU.S Military Power\nThe U.S has by far the\nmost military expenditure\ncompared to any other\ncountry, more than 600\neach. The United States\nhas 11 aircraft carriers in\nservice, more than what\nthe rest of the world has\naltogether, and has 72\noperating nuclear-pow-ered submarines, more\nthan what Russia, France,\nthe UK and China have\ncombined. The U.S also\nhas about 800 military\nbases in 40 countries. The\nUK comes second on this\nlist having military bases\nin 13 countries only. The\nU.S military also accounts\nfor 60 million tonnes of\ncarbon dioxide emission\nper year. That is more\nthan the total carbon\ndioxide produced by most\ncountries.

    "content": "ISSUE 1740\nFELIX\n7\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUnited States vs Iran\nComment writer Aida Manzano Kharman argues that it is important to understand the\ncontext of the news that we read\nCOMMENT\nAida Manzano\nKharman\nComment Writer\nI\nt is likely that many\nof the readers have\nheard of escalating\ntensions between the\nUS and Iran, especially\nafter the assassination of\nQassem Soleimani.While\nmany were taken by\nsurprise after this move\nfrom the US, it is crucial\nto understand that in fact\nthis event, as rogue as it\nwas, is a result of a steady\ndeterioration between the\nUS and Iran\u2019s relations.\nAfter 2015 there was\na sense of hope and\noptimism that the decades\nof tension between Iran\nand the US were perhaps\non the wane, following\nthe nuclear deal between\nObama and Rouhani. This\ndeal essentially outlined\nthat in exchange for Iran\nlimiting their nuclear\nactivities and allowing\ninternational inspectors\ninto their nuclear facili-ties, the US would lift its\neconomic sanctions that\ncrippled Iran\u2019s economy.\nThis deal was successful and aided the mending\nof the two countries\u2019\nestranged diplomatic rela-tions. However, following\nDonald Trump\u2019s entry\ninto the White House,\ndiplomatic relations were\nsoon to suffer. Trump\nhad stated as part of his\ncampaign that he wanted\nto abandon the nuclear\ndeal, otherwise formally\nknown as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n(JCPOA), one that had\nbeen negotiated by the\nUnited States, the United\nKingdom, Russia, France,\nChina and Germany and\nIran. This move was\nhighly discouraged by key\ninternational players such\nas France and China, that\nadvised against the move,\ngiven that the evidence\nwas clear that Iran had in\nfact been adhering to the\ndeal. The International\nAtomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) and Mike Pompeo\nverified this, with the\nonly claims against this\ncoming from Benjamin\nNetanyahu. He argued that\nIran had broken the deal\ngiven that they had not\ndisclosed their research\ninto nuclear weapons, and\nbased on alleged evidence\nthat Israel had obtained,\nIran had been carrying\nout research into nuclear\nweapons and had not\ndisclosed it.\nThe IAEA responded\nthat there is no evidence\nthat Iran tried to develop\nnuclear weapons after\n2009 and other EU countries spoke out saying that\nthey were not na\u00efve about\nIran\u2019s nuclear intentions,\nbut that regardless, the\nterms of the JCPOA had\nnot been broken by Iran.\nInterestingly enough,\nthere is a very clear irony\nin Israel\u2019s sudden aversion\nof nuclear warheads in the\nMiddle East, when they\nthemselves are widely\nknown to possess nuclear\nwarheads, and they have\nvery purposely remained\nambiguous when it comes\nto their international\nstatements about the\nissue, never officially\ndenying or admitting to\nhaving the weapons, yet\ncalling out Iran when not\ndisclosing information\nabout their research on\nnuclear weapons, despite\nthem being guilty of the\nexact same accusation.\nIt is estimated that they\nhave anywhere between\n80 and 400 warheads,\nand they also declined\nto sign the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, despite\nthe UN\u2019s urges to join it.\nAfter all the accusations and Netanyahu\u2019s\ntheatrical speech and\nnewfound rejection of\nnuclear weapons, Trump\nabandoned the nuclear\ndeal in May 2018 and\nreinstated the economic\nsanctions against Iran.\nHe also threatened do\nthe same to countries and\ncompanies that continue\nto buy goods from Iran.\nThis move meant that\nIran was forced into a\ndiplomatic issue with the\nUS, as neither does Trump\nwish to abide by the\nnuclear deal that the US\ninitially organised, neither\ndoes he acknowledge the\ninternational sources that\nback that Iran had in fact\nbeen complying with the\ndeal, and also forces every\nother country that has\neconomic ties with Iran to\nactively choose between\nmaintaining these relations with Iran and thus\nbecoming target of the\nUS\u2019 sanctions, or cutting\noff ties with an economic\npartner.\nIran then issued a\nstatement calling Trump\n\u201cunacceptable\u201d and\ndecided to bypass the US\nand continue negotiations\nof the deal with the\nremaining signatories:\nFrance, Germany, UK,\nRussia and China. The\nUS announces the rolling\nout of their sanctions soon\nafter and Iran as a result\nstates that they will no\nlonger keep the enriched\nuranium and produced\nheavy water limited, and\nthat the signatories of the\ndeal have 60 days to fulfil\ntheir part of the JCPOA.\nIran then issues another\nwarning statement 10\ndays before surpassing\nthe limit, saying that this\ncan be reversed if the\nEuropean signatories\nstep in to stop the US\nsanctions and abide by\ntheir part of the deal. This\nnever happens and more\nevents in the Gulf ensue\nwhere Iran and the US\nclash. Amongst these are\nthe US sanctions to Iran\u2019s\nforeign minister Javad\nZarif, the shooting down\nof a US drone by Iran,\nthe US\u2019 deployment of\nF-22 stealth fighters, and\nthe US\u2019 attempts to keep\nthe Grace 1, an Iranian\ntanker, under detention\nin Gibraltar, despite\nGibraltar\u2019s supreme court\nruling that the vessel is\nfree to sail, also offering\nseveral millions to the\ncaptain of the vessel if\nhe agreed to steer it into\na country where it could\nbe seized. These are just\na few of the events that\noccurred as an aftermath,\nbut the most recent and\nnotable ones were the US\u2019\nassassination of Qassem\nSoleimani, and Iran\u2019s\nfiring of missiles against\nthe Ukrainian passenger\nairplane, that had been\nmistaken by a US cruise\nair missile according to\nthe Iranian government.\nThere seems to be a\nclear trend towards the\nscaling of aggression and\nthe deterioration of negotiation talks between the\nUS and Iran since Trump\nbecame president, with\nmany moves on the US\u2019\nside showing an unnecessary provocative attitude\ntowards Iran despite\nIran\u2019s initial willingness\nto renegotiate the nuclear\ndeal and continue to abide\nby it. Trump created a\nproblem between Iran and\nthe US when there was\nnone to start with, to show\na \u201cstrong\u201d response and\nthe timing of this is very\ncoincidental with his impeachment scandal and the\nend of his term looming\nwith the 2020 elections,\nwhich unsurprisingly\nenough, is a similar situation in which his only international supporter was,\nNetanyahu, with serious\ncorruption charges, and\nat the time, an upcoming\nelection. It is especially\nworrying how the US\ngovernment believes it is\nentitled enough to kill a\ngovernment general, and\nthen proceed to justify\nthis assassination, and it\nis also not only worrying\nbut tragic how the lives of\ncivilians were the cost to\npay for the Iranian government\u2019s mistake.\nUltimately, as readers,\nit is crucial that we\nunderstand the context\nof the political news that\nare reported in the media,\nand avoid falling victim\nto propaganda and ma-nipulation., as it is sadly\nbecoming a trend to see\nmedia outlets suddenly\nvilify collectives to suit\nthe agenda of certain\npolitical parties, and then\nconveniently omit the so\nnecessary context that\nprovides a better understanding of the causes and\nthe consequences of the\nreported events.\nOh no, someone\u2019s set the Iranian and US flags alight // publicdomainpictures.net\n\n"

    "content": "Binge of the Week: Dracula\nN\netflix\u2019s 2020\nseries retells\nthe classic\nv a m p i r e\nfantasy story Dracula by\nBram Stoker, following\nCount Dracula\u2019s (played\nby Claes Bang) journey\nfrom Transylvania to\nEngland and his attempt\nto spread the undead\ncurse, whilst battling\nwith the descendants of\nVan Helsing. The show\nis written by Mark Gatiss\nand Steven Moffat, both\npreviously writers of\nBBC\u2019s Sherlock. Needless\nto say, they both have\nconsiderable experience\nadapting classic stories\ninto the format of three\n90 minutes long episodes.\nEach episode gives a\npiece of the story while\nmaintaining a complete,\nstandalone arc surrounding Dracula.\nThis interpretation\nretains many of the classic\nelements of the original\nversion, including Dracula\u2019s encounter with\nEnglish solicitor Jonathan\nHarker, boarding of the\nDemeter ship, arrival in\nEngland and final battle\nwith Van Helsing. One\nmain difference is transforming the character of\nProfessor Abraham Van\nHelsing to Sister Agatha\nVan Helsing and Dr. Zoe\nVan Helsing (both played\nby Dolly Wells). Another\ndifference includes\nbringing Dracula to\nmodern England for his\nfinal confrontations in the\nthird episode. The plot is\nsplit reasonably into three\nparts, the first of which\nintroduces the infamous\nCount Dracula and Van\nHelsing, the second details\nhis journey while building\nthe rising action, while\nthe last bringing about the\nclimax - the final battle\nand Dracula\u2019s epiphany.\nLogically one would\nexpect the suspense to\nbuild up as we inch closer\nto the season finale,\nhowever, I find the actual\nepisodes play out to be\nalmost the exact opposite.\nI find the first episode the\nmost well-written and\nexecuted, slowly declining with the introduction\nof more side characters.\nWhile the writers clarified\nthat the adaptation would\nbe both \u201cfaithful and faithless\u201d as with their other\nworks, I find that there is\nless room for creative development with Dracula.\nUnlike with Sherlock\nwhere more raw material\nis available to begin with,\nDracula features a short,\ncomplete storyline where\nnot much can be altered.\nThis is typical of Moffat\u2019s\nwriting style - wonderfully pretentious but a bit of\nan overkill at times.\nThe ending is a twist\nI have not expected and\nis in stark contrast to the\noriginal. It feels like a\nstandoff between a metaphorical and a physical\nending. The original work\nfocuses on the aspect of\nvampire-slaying, while\nthe adaptation features\na mental battle, where\nwe delve into Dracula\u2019s\npast and motivations.\nThis also takes place in\ncontemporary England,\nwith classic characters\nlike Lucy Westenra\n(played by Lydia West),\nJohn Seward (played by\nMatthew Beard), and\nQuincey Morris (played\nby Phil Dunster) adapted\nto the 21st century. All\nin all, I think the writers\ntried to incorporate more\nelements than necessary\n- leaving the final product\nunderwhelming, messy,\nand too much of a detour.\nThe shift to modern\nEngland could have been\na nice touch, but 1) the\ncharacters are poorly\nadapted - for instance\nLucy has turned into an\nunlikeable, self-absorbed\nparty girl, and 2) the\nexecution not only lacks\nthe gothic aura of the late\neighteenth century but\nalso fails to set the tone\nfor a horror setting. The\noverall mood could have\nbeen more consistent;\nthe characters could have\nbeen more fleshed-out.\nIt leaves something to be\ndesired.\nThe highlight of the\nshow for me is the character of Sister Agatha\nVan Helsing - Wells does\nan amazing job bringing\nlife to this witty, sharp-tongued nun. This is a\nsuccessful change of char-acter, where she was naturally woven into the plot.\nA nun in a convent lends\nitself nicely to a vampire\nstory in the late nineteenth\ncentury. The character\nis also well-written -every line she delivers is\nprecise and/or hilarious.\nThe titular character\nDracula, as portrayed\nby Claes Bang, comes\nacross ordinary and a little\ndull. It\u2019s difficult to play\nthe single most famous\nvampire in the history of\nvampires, and this iteration suffers from the lack\nof a distinct personality\nwhich can also be attributed to the writing. It feels as\nif Dracula is just another\nblood-thirsty vampire\nrunning around searching\nfor brides, nothing special.\nWhile the moment of\nredemption sheds light on\nhis vulnerability, it does\nnot exactly align with\nthe Dracula from the first\ntwo episodes. This may\nbe controversial but I\nfind this version of Count\nDracula lackluster and\ninconsistent.\nThe cinematography\nis especially crucial\nfor the genre of horror.\nIt takes the right shots\nand framing techniques\nto create spine-chilling\nmoments that exemplify\nthe genre. The first two\nepisodes successfully tap\ninto our psyche with its\neerie lighting, unexpected\ntransitions, unique angles.\nIt\u2019s interesting that the\nproduction team kept flies\nas a motif that is fitting and\nprovides a strong visual.\nHowever, the cinematography for the third episode\nresembles that of a typical\ndrama rather than horror -the lighting, depth of field,\nexposure could have been\nimproved.\nThere were both ups\nand downs in this adap-tation. Many details were\ndone right, for example,\nteasing of \u201ctraditions/\nmyths\u201d about vampires\nwas quirky. Sadly the\nseries started off strong\nbut finished weakly. For\npotential future seasons,\nI\u2019m more interested to see\nthem playing with perhaps\nDracula\u2019s origin story. All\nin all, it\u2019s still delightfully\ndiabolic, and I would recommend it if you\u2019re in the\nmood for some vampire\nfantasy drama.\nAnother rendition of Bram Stoker\u2019s classic gothic horror novel Dracula, shedding light to Count Dracula\u2019s\nvulnerability with an unexpected twist ending\nDracula // Wikimedia\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nJANUARY, 2020\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTV Editor\nCreator: Mark Gatiss,\nSteven Moffat Starring:\nClaus Bang, Dolly Wells,\nJohn Hefferman\n\u201cThe overall\nmood\ncould have\nbeen more\nconsistent;\nthe characters\ncould have\nbeen more\nfleshed-out\u201d\n\n"

Although\nthe weather was partly to\nblame here, it did not come\nwithout ample warning\ngiving the Union time to\nreact, plan and reach out\nto CSPs. Although the\nUnion admitted defeat\nin this case, and did\naim to make it up to the\nCSPs, was the attempt at\nthe Welcome Back Fair\nenough to make up for\nthe catastrophic effect of\ntheir prior actions?\nAt Union Council this\nweek, I was pleasantly\nsurprisedatTom\u2019s(DPCS)\nrecent acknowledgement\nof the fact that student-led\ninitiatives have been more\nsuccessful than if they\nwere done by the Union.\nAlthough speaking here\nregarding the matter of\nACC andArts nights at the\nunion, Tom has also mentioned this in the context\nof student involvement\nregarding updating Union\nsystems. This would be\na major step forward in\nensuring that students\nare at the heart of the\nUnion\u2019s decisions that\neffect student volunteers.\nAn example of which I\nhave personally witnessed\nregarding sponsorship\ncontracts.\nMany of you are likely\naware that concerns\nhave been raised over\nthe way that sponsorship\ncontracts are signed by\nthe DPFS. The current\nsystem involves the\nDPFS checking through\nthe multiple pages of\nthe contracts are legally\nbinding documents. And\neven after the contracts\nhave been signed, there\u2019s\nanother week to get the\ninvoice for your sponsor\nas the Finance team has to\napprove it once again.\nAs you can see this\nisn\u2019t the most efficient\npath for a document to be\nprocessed as it essentially\nhas to go through the\nunion twice. It also seems\nlike a mismanagement\nof the DPFS\u2019s valuable\ntime, taking away from\ntheir other, arguably more\nimportant responsibilities,\nsuch as returning food\nto the Union! Moreover,\nhaving gone through this\n13 times myself, I can\nsay from experience that\nthe sponsorship process is\nincredibly laborious and\ntime consuming for CSPs\nand often sponsors grow\nimpatient. (Just imagine\nwhat DoCSoc go through,\ndoing this over 50 times!)\nWith growing concerns\nraised by multiple CSPs,\nparticularly DepSocs,\nHilliam (CGCU Treasurer) and I took it upon\nourselves to do something\nabout it. After sitting\ndown for less than 5\nminutes, we already had a\npretty decent idea of how\nto implement a \u201cSponsorship Contract builder\u201d on\neActivities.\nOur proposition would\nallow CSPs to input\ntheir variables, such as\nsponsor name, fee and\nservices provided and\nthen receive a finished,\nsigned, contract. From\nhere the contract can be\nsigned by the CSP and\nsponsor then uploaded to\nhave an invoice generat-ed, like how POs work.\nThis system would also\nallow for management\ngroup checks, reducing\nthe number of contracts\nreaching the DPFS that\nhave errors. All in all we\ncreated this to save ourselves and also the DPFS\na lot of time!\nWhilst we were extremely grateful that the\nOfficer Trustees have been\nincredibly on board with\nour idea, we are struggling\nto see the vision of implementation of the idea.\nHilliam and I were soon\ntold the matter was being\ntaken care of and haven\u2019t\nbeen consulted since. This\nis only just one case, but\nas it is student volunteers\nlike ourselves who we are\nthinking about the most, it\nmakes us lose confidence\nwhen the Union decides\nto handle actions by itself\nand we have to entrust that\nthese ideas aren\u2019t poorly\nexecuted. As student volunteers we have recently\nbeen promised many\nthings. This includes experienced student volunteers delivering sessions\nat officer academy and a\nsystem that would allow\nstudents to directly contribute to improvements\nof the Union\u2019s systems.\nAlthough these ideas\nsound like a step forward\nin improving the Union\u2019s\nrelationship with its\nstudent volunteers, after\nrecent miscommunica-tions and false promises,\nwe are yet to see if they\nwill be successful or if\nthe Union will continue to\ndangle the carrot in front\nof us.\nRSMU\nChris Carter\nRSMU President\nI\nn just under a month,\n150RoyalMinerswill\nbe heading down to\nCornwall to continue\na much-loved RSMU tra-dition, older than Imperial\nCollege itself.

It really is worth the\nhype; but be sure to bring\nlots of warm clothes (like\nour RSM Bobble Hats and\nScarves) to keep warm.\nEach team will compete\nfor an individual prize\n(either an actual trophy, or\njust bragging rights), with\nthe rugby team competing\nfor the titular Bottle, a\n3-foot-tall tin beer bottle\nthat was \u2018liberated\u2019 from a\ndelivery lorry by a group\nof students in 1926.

    "content": "His Dark Materials: Paradise Regained (Finally)\nA new attempt at televising Philip Pullman\u2019s epic trilogy finally seems to get it right\nH\nis Dark\nM a t e r i a l s\n(HDM) is a\nnew series\nbroadcast by both the BBC\nand HBO. It is a fresh\ntake on Philip Pullman\u2019s\noriginal eponymous\ntrilogy. Following the\ndisappointing reception of\nthe original television adaptation of The Northern\nLights (the first book\nin the trilogy) as the\nfeature film The Golden\nCompass, we unfortunately had to wait until the\ntelevision and film rights\nexpired before being able\nto experience any more of\nthe story on screen. Now\nthat the wait is finally\nover, and the first season\nof His Dark Materials has\nbeen released, it does not\ndisappoint.\nThe first season has a\nmuch darker tone and a\nmore modern and realistic\nfeel than The Golden\nCompass which is much\ntruer to the nature of\nthe books. The Golden\nCompass tended to tone\ndown the content to\nmake things relatively\nchild friendly, losing the\nessence of the original\ntrilogy in the process.\nPullman\u2019s belief is that\nfiction whose readership\nincludes children (there\nis no such thing as \u201cchildren\u2019s fiction\u201d, since any\nchildren\u2019s book will also\nbe read by adults, says he),\nshould be able to deal with\nany issues that children\nmight realistically experience in their everyday\nlives. This includes\ntraditionally taboo themes\nsuch as divorce and sexual\nmaturity, which of course\nare things that children\nmay come across in some\nform in their daily lives,\nbut may not fully com-prehend. In keeping with\nhis philosophy, his trilogy\nincludes ideas about\nthings such as puberty,\nreligious indoctrination\nand oppression. Definitely not what you might\nimmediately associate\nwith children\u2019s literature.\nThese, notably, are also\nthe things which The\nGolden Compass seemed\nto filter out, which made it\nflop despite its stellar cast,\nwhich included Nicole\nKidman and Daniel Craig.\nIt is unclear whether\nthe decision was made to\nembolden the storytelling\nbecause of a return to\nPullman\u2019s original ideals,\nor whether it is simply\nreflective of the fact that\nthose who were children\nat the time of The Golden\nCompass\u2019s release, or who\nread the original trilogy at\nthe time, are now adults.\nPerhaps by not limiting\nthe run time to the length\nof a feature film, the team\nhad more time to experiment with developing and\nadding depth to the story.\nIn any case, it was a step\nin the right direction.\nThe season is well\nput together in terms of\nstorytelling, pace, and its\noverall tone. The headquarters of the Magisterium (a vaguely disguised\nrepresentation of the\nCatholic Church) are in\na clean cut, minimalist\nbuilding, in stark contrast\nto the magical spires of\nthe Oxford colleges that\nthe protagonist, Lyra,\ncalls home. Despite the\nfact that technological\nadvancements such as\nmodern touch screen\nsmartphones and tablet\ncomputers were not used\nat the time that Pullman\nwrote the original trilogy,\ndifferent forms of such\ntechnology make frequent\nappearances throughout\nthe first season, further\nemphasising that this is a\nshow of our times. These\nmodern touches by the\ncreative team are a testament to their awareness of\nthe modern audience.\nAn interesting distinction from the books\nwas the inclusion of\nparts of The Subtle Knife\n(the second book in the\ntrilogy), interleaved\nthroughout scenes from\nThe Northern Lights.\nWriter Jack Thorne\n(Skins, Shameless, Harry\nPotter and the Cursed\nChild) has mentioned that\nthe production team had\nthe benefit of hindsight,\nwith all 3 parts of the\ntrilogy to work with from\nthe get-go, meaning that\nthey could throw away\nthe need for chronological\nstorytelling and introduce\nelements of the second\nbook much earlier. on\nThis enables them to\nforeshadow future events\nin a different way to the\nnovels, drawing interesting parallels between\nplotlines, and I think it\nworks very well.\nOf course, the first\nseason isn\u2019t perfect by any\nmeans. I felt the pacing for\nthe first few episodes was\nrather slow, presumably\nto set the scene and avoid\nbombarding the audience\nwith details that could\nbe revealed over time, as\nrequired. However, this\ndoes change as the story\nprogresses.\nIt might be my prej-udice, already being\nfamiliar with the HDM\nuniverse, but I felt that the\naudience were sometimes\npatronised a bit too much.\nCertain expositions about\nplot points or the quirks\nof Lyra\u2019s world, done\nmostly through character dialogue, seemed\nunnecessary and could\nhave been better executed\nthrough simply showing\nus, rather than telling.\nOne thing that was done\nwell was the diversity in\ncasting, with black actors\nand actresses in roles\nacross the board. This\nnotably includes Ariyon\nBakare who gives an outstanding performance as\nLord Boreal, and Clarke\nPeters as the master of\nJordan College. This\ncould of course be taken\nfurther through the inclusion of people from a more\ndiverse variety of ethnic\nbackgrounds. The world\nis not just black and white\n- it is grey too, something\nperfectly exemplified by\none of the most interesting\ncharacters in the His Dark\nMaterials trilogy: Mrs\nCoulter, whose morality is\nvery grey indeed.\nRuth Wilson\u2019s performance as Marisa Coulter\nis, in a word, brilliant. It is\nas true to the books as you\ncould wish for. Her scenes\nwith Lyra (Daphne Keen)\nexquisitely exhibit the\ninner conflict of a woman\ndoing the wrong things\nfor perhaps not-so-wrong\nreasons. Jack Thorne\u2019s\ngoal of avoiding making\nher one-dimensional\nreally does come across.\nJames McAvoy was\ndrafted in as Lord Asriel\nas an emergency replacement late on in the\nprocess. His performance\nis accurate though perhaps\nslightly theatrical, in the\nliteral sense: in certain\nscenes I felt as though\nI was watching a play\nrather than a TV show.\nDespite his at times over-the-top performance, he\neffectively portrays Lord\nAsriel as a dynamic and\npreoccupied man, prone\nto fits of aggression, but\nwith a strong purpose.\nFinally, I would like\nto mention the central\ncharacter: Lyra herself,\nplayed by Daphne Keen.\nIt is immediately obvious\nthat Lyra\u2019s character in the\nTV show is not the same\nas the one in the books,\nbut that is not to say that\nthat it is an entirely bad\nthing. Pullman has gone\nso far as to describe the\nliterary Lyra as a \u201cgreedy\nlittle savage\u201d, on account\nof her mischievousness\nand propensity for telling\nlies, but the Lyra in the\nshow is a very different\ngirl. Although still men-dacious, she appears to\nbe much more innocent.\nShe perhaps comes across\nas a little too docile. In\nthe show\u2019s defence, this\ncan be reconciled with\nthe overarching theme\nof the original trilogy\n(again, one that Pullman\nmay have only become\naware of while writing the\nstories in retrospect), of\nthe transition from innocence to wisdom.\nOverall, this series is\ndefinitely worth a watch!\nIt should be exciting for\nthose who, as of yet,\nhave no experience of the\nworld of daemons and\npanserbj\u00f8rne, and also\noffers seasoned readers a\nfresh enough take on the\noriginal\u2026 materials\u2026 to\nkeep them interested.\nNow\u2026 stop standing\nat the brink of hell,\npondering your voyage,\nand go and find His Dark\nMaterials on iPlayer!\nHis Dark Materials, now available on BBC iPlayer // HBO/BBC\nISSUE 1740\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nTELEVISION\nWaleed El-Geresy\nTV Writer\nWritten by: Jack Thorne.\nStarring: Dafne Keen,\nRuth Wilson, James\nMcAvoy\nSeason 1\n\n"

What it\nshould mean is a person\nof certain characters and\nqualities, and those those\nwho can sacri\ufb01ce now to\ngain later. Acts on logic,\nand not emotions. Makes\na plan, and sticks to it.\nStrategy can be applied\nto any scary source, but\nwhen applied to money we\nare thinking about putting\nclose on one back. True to\nthe original de\ufb01nition, and\nthat is of the latin word in-vesterie, to clothe oneself.\nSo, if you are wearing\nclothes right now you\nare in a very good place\nto start being an investor.\nOtherwise, go and put\nsome clothes on and\ncome back to this article.\nAnd try to convince you\nof why you should be an\n(active) investor from this\nmoment onwards.\nInvesting vs. Gambling\nWord \u201cinvesting\u201d is\nbeing thrown around\nhowever, especially in\ncase when things have\nnothing to do with investing but everything with\nchance. Speculation, is not\ninvesting. What shows it\namazingly is a scene from\nSouth Park E3S13 (great\nepisode), where Stan puts\nhis $100 cheque into his\nbank to \u201cgrow\u201d without\nany plan or investigation\ninto process:\n\u201cWe can put that\ncheck in a money-market\nmutual fund, then we\u2019ll\nreinvest the earnings into\nforeign-currency accounts\nwith compounding\ninterest aaaaaaand it\u2019s\ngone!\u201d Poof, it\u2019s gone.\nSadly to many people\ninvesting appears to\nbe exactly that, putting\nmoney through \ufb01nancial\nmechanism with an opportunity of (probable)\nreward. The truth, unless\nyou\u2019re a High Frequency\nTrader\u2026 you\u2019ll end up\nlike Stan. What investing\nactually is, is owning a\npiece of business. And\nStan didn\u2019t try to look into\nhealthy businesses that\nmight be undervalued and\nwill grow within the next\n\ufb01ve to ten years. He just\nwanted \u201cmoney to grow\u201d,\nwell money doesn\u2019t grow\non trees and neither it\ndoes in a bank account. If\nStan instead invested his\nmoney into a business he\nmight know of enough to\nmake a decision to support\nhe would end up differ-ently. Like video games.\nVirtual reality has been\ncoming to our homes for\nages, with game studios\nlike NVIDIA working\non it. If Stan bought 11\nstocks at $7.98 and paid\n$10 in fees spending his\n$100 (not a great strategy\nto spend everything on a\nsingle stock, but Stan is\njust a child), aaaaaaaand\nforgot about it till Oculus\nrift hits the shelves and\nrises to popularity in 2018.\nHe would have $3036\nworth in stock. That\u2019s the\ndifference between investing and speculating.\nHow to start\nIt has never been\nsimpler than now, you\njust Google \u201chow to buy\nstocks\u201d and here you have\nit. Back in the day you\nwould need to call in to\na broker, which would\nthen not only try to sell\nstocks to you Wolf-of\n-Wall street style but also\ntake a commission for\neverything you\u2019ll try to do\non top of basic costs. But\ngoing beyond the practical\naspect, as little as \u00a320 will\nsuf\ufb01ce to start and gain\nthe experience. Yes there\nare simulators, but it\u2019s\ncrazy how differently we\nbehave when real money\nis at stake. If you can\nplay the stock market like\na video game, with no\nemotions just by looking\nat numbers you\u2019re a nat-ural-born investor whos is\nbetter than Warren Buffet.\nHowever 99.9% of us\nwill have to sadly learn\nfor ourselves. It\u2019s a bit\nlike gardening, it\u2019ll take\nfew years to see result\nof your decisions. So the\nearlier you start the better.\nOnce you decide to\ninvest, you\u2019ll have to\nthink about what kind of\ninvestor you want to be:\npassive or aggressive. By\ndoing a lot of research\n(start with: Investopedia,\nIntelligent Investor by\nBenjamin Graham and of\ncourse joining appropriate\nCollege societies) and\nthink on how committed\nyou can be.\nHow do we benefit?\nWell, most importantly\nmoney invested is distributed well. It\u2019s not hanging\nout within the \ufb01nancial\nmechanisms but is being\ntargeted for appropriate\nbusinesses individuals\nconsider worth supporting\nwhich then can perform\nwell through the use of\nthese funds.\nGiving back to its\ninvestors but also increasing quality of service\nto everyone else. But\nthe biggest change, one\nwould say is the societal\none. Act of investment,\nas described in future\ninstalments, is part of\nones character. Sacri\ufb01cing\nnow, to gain later by\nthinking of the future. A\npersonal quality that\u2019s\nbest acquired through\ninvesting.\n\u201c...an investor\nis a fat cat\nwith with\nbells floating\nout of his\nBentley whilst\nhe jumps out\nfor a meeting\nwith the City\nof London\nCorporation...\u201d\nThe stock price of the NVIDIA Corp. has made meteoric gains in the later half of the decade //Google Finance\n\n"

The manifestation of these corporate\ngovernance changes\nwill be a driver for the\nJapanese stock market\nand makes it particularly\nattractive, especially at\ncurrent valuations (P/E\nof approximately 15x\nacross market in line with\nmarkets like US).\nMoney Where Their\nMouth Is\nSome institutional\ninvestors are beginning\nto put their money where\ntheir mouth is.

Patrik Schowitz,\nGlobal Multi-Asset Strategist at JPMorgan Asset\nManagement, recently\nspoke to Bloomberg about\nthe underperformance of\nJapanese Equities over the\nlast few years compared\nto the US and why now\nwould be an opportune\ntime to invest in this\nmarket as many other\nregions\u2019 stocks begin to\nlook comparatively ex-pensive.\nEqually, Goldman\nSachs expects 8% EPS\ngrowth in 2020 followed\nby 6% in 2021.

Demographic transformation,\ncultural evolution as the\ncountry becomes more\nopen to immigration, and\na reassessment of the role\nthat the country plays in\nthe international order are\nall extremely interesting.\nDespite some of these\nchallenges, I think that\nthese changes from an investment perspective will\nprecipitate strong returns\nfor those who are overweight Japanese equities.\nCrucially, an evolution in\nthe corporate governance\nstrategies of Japanese\ncompany management\nteams will arguably have\nthe biggest impact on the\nstock market and Abe\u2019s\neconomic reforms will\nsupport this growth.\nAs the country opens up\nto the world for the Rugby\nand the Olympics, so too\nshould investors who are\n\u201c...evolution in\nthe corporate\ngovernance\nstrategies ...\nwill arguably\nhave the\nbiggest impact\n...\u201d\nElements of Art of War: The Sino-American Trade War\nINVESTMENT\nKevin Wang\nICIS\nInvestment Member\nC\nan a trade war\nbe fought in the\nsame methods\nas a physical\nwar? To find the answer to\nthis question, one has to\ngo back in time to an era\nof turbulence in the 5th\ncentury BC. The author\nof this magnum opus,\nSun Tsu, was the chief of\nstaff who was confronted\na problem: how to defeat\nan enemy, often in a disadvantageous situation?\nCenturies later, though\nmuch has not changed in\nprinciple, it is needless\nto state that the fa\u00e7ade\nof physical warfare\nhas changed with the\nevolution of weaponry.\nSimilarly, trade wars and\ncurrency wars did not\nchange much either in the\nlast centuries. All tactics\nof a field war may be used\nin both contexts: elements\nof surprise, force of\nattack, plan and strategy.\nIn this article the author\nwill investigate exactly\nthat in the perspective\nof the trade war between\nUnited States and China.\nDeath Ground\nUnited States is without\ndoubt the party with larger\nsize and consequently\nbigger caliber. So how can\nChina hold off repeated\nattacks in form of sanctions and political pres-sures? Sun Tsu gave us\nthe answer: \u2018Should you\nbe outnumbered; the best\nroute is retreat. It is better\nto fight with absolute\nnumerical advantage.\u2019 In\nsimple words, divide and\nconquer. Is it possible\nfor a country as big as\nChina to evade the pursuit\nits adversary? Is the\noption of a retreat open?\nUnfortunately, the trade\nwar provides no room for\nretreat. Sun Tsu called it\nthe \u2018death ground\u2019. The\nonly option for the dragon\ncountry is to face that of\nthe eagle in the eye.\nDoes this mean that the\ntrade war has to be conducted in form of trench\nmassacre? Not necessar-ily. Though no space is\navailable for retreat, China\ncan attack where defense\nis light on the American\nside while holding off\nAmerican assaults on the\nother side of the battle-field, essentially fighting\na van-guard action on\none side while having the\nold guard marching onto\nthe Pratzen height (from\nthe Battle of Austerlitz).\nIndeed, maneuvering is in\nthe heart of the Art of War,\nsince a war of attrition\nbetween the two parties\nwill without doubt lead to\nthe demise of the weaker\nside. As we shall see, the\nChinese are well aware\nof this point.To prevent a\nrout, China has to hold, at\nthe very least, in theatres\nof sanction and technolo-gy, where the Americans\nhave the lead. Chinese\nexport was hit hard in the\nlatter half of 2019. The\nsituation became critical\nin November, but it held.\nA similar situation developed in the technology\ntheatre, where interventions of the Department\nof Commerce of the\nUnited States effectively\ncrippled ZTE by means\nof sanction. It also put up\npolicies against 5G technology by Huawei due to\nsecurity reasons.\nGathering Ammunition\nThe Chinese government also understands\nthat \u2018wars are not won on\nevacuations\u2019. The theater\nof attack was the foreign\nexchange market, in\nwhich the Chinese were\nin full control. In the first\nplace, mainland market is\nsealed off to Foreigners\nby the implementation of\nexchange control. This\ncreates a layer of insulation between domestic\nmarkets and international\nmarkets. Sun Tzu noted\nthat \u2018all you can do is\nto establish a position\nensuring non-defeat - to\nwin or not depends on\nyour enemy making a\nmistake\u2019. With much fore-sight, the Chinese government then embarked on a\njourney to collect as much\nRenminbi as possible\nin overseas markets. It\nfurther regulated the\noffshore Renminbi market\nin Hong Kong, mainly\nby strictly monitoring its\nsize. One must understand\nthat, in order to short a\nsovereign currency, the\nspeculator must be able\nto gather enough of the\ncurrency to influence\nthe market, much like an\nattacking army must get\nhold of enough ammunition before any meaningful action. These tactics\neffectively eliminate the\npossibility of a large-scale\nspeculative sell-off. In\nthis scenario, the Chinese\nleadership wisely took\naway the ammunition\nneeded to be used by the\nother side. All of these\nwill ensure a non-defeat\nresult on the Chinese side.\nWhat did the Americans do in retaliation?\nThey labeled China as a\ncurrency manipulator, but\nwas this justified? The\npower to control interest\nrate and currency outflow\nis deeply enshrined in\na state\u2019s sovereignty,\nno less than that of its\nborder. It was the choice\nof the Americans that\nthey shall not manipulate\ntheir currency exchanges,\nbut they have no right to\nforce such choice onto\nthe Chinese who do not\nwish to conduct business\nin this manner. Hence\nthis \u2018currency manipulator\u2019 label only exerts its\ninfluence on people also\nbelieving in free market.\nSuch course of action\nwould take no effect on\nthe Chinese should they\nthink sound economic\npolicy involves government intervention in extraordinary times. Trade\nwar is undoubtedly such\nan extraordinary situation.\nWill the Chinese turn\nout victorious in the trade\nwar according to Sun\nTzu\u2019s strategies? It is far\ntoo early at this stage to\npredict the outcome of the\ntrade war, but one should\nsee treaties signed in the\nnear future.\n\u201c The only\noption for\nthe dragon\ncountry is to\nface that of the\neagle in the\neye. \u201d\nlooking to navigate the\nrather ominous future for\nglobal equity markets.\n\n"

With no heavily\nchoreographed dancing\nand no distinct songs, it\nsets itself apart from, and\nabove, all musicals I\u2019ve\never seen before. In The\nUmbrellas of Cherbourg,\nevery word of dialogue\nis sang in tender singsong and accompanied\nby gentle tunes. I believe\nwithout first hearing this\nfor yourself, the thought\nof this for an entire feature\nlength film might be quite\nirritating, but I found this\nto flow so softly and fall on\nthe ears so pleasantly that\nyou would be surprised\nat how well it works.\nFrankly, I think this style\nis just as effective (if not\nmore so) than occasional\noutbursts of song.\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg follows an ill-fated\nromance between teenage\nGenevi\u00e8ve (Catherine\nDeneuve), who helps her\ndisapproving mother run\nthe town\u2019s umbrella shop,\nand Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), a local mechanic,\nand the events succeeding\nGuy\u2019s draft to serve in the\nAlgerian War. This could\nbe following the skeleton\nof a plot for any bog-stand-ard romance, but for some\nreason it\u2019s different. The\nstory feels very real and is\nvery simple. We get to see\nthe harsh reality of being\nin love, un-sugar-coated,\ndespite the dreamlike\nsinging and bubble-gum\nsets. This contrast is what\nmakes some scenes so af-fective, and is particularly\napparent in the touching\nfinal scene in which you\ncan\u2019t tell if you\u2019re happy\nor heartbroken for the\ncharacters.\nWith a mouth-watering\ncolour palette, beautiful\nThis made it even easier\nto appreciate the details\nput into the film\u2019s design,\nfrom the matching colours\nof Genevi\u00e8ve\u2019s outfits\nand the background, to\nthe dreamy wallpapers.\nIt is clear to see that\nthis colourful style has\ninspired directors such as\nWes Anderson, and other\nmusicals, such as La La\nLand (but being the proto-type, it is far superior). It\ncannot be stressed enough\nhow gorgeous this film is.\nThe creative direction is\nsimply exquisite.\nWhilst in plot this film\nis not ground breaking,\nin execution it is perfect.\nAlthough the plot itself\nis romantic and heart\nwrenching, it provides\nnothing new and the film\nowes its greatness to its\nvibrant colours, which\nclash with the melancholy\nstory, and moving score.\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a technicolour,\nmusical masterpiece that\neveryone must watch in\ntheir lifetime, particularly\non the big screen.\nI watched this as part of\nthe BFI\u2019s musical season\nand would highly recommend catching one of its\nfeatures before the season\nreaches its end at the end\nof this month.\nGenevi\u00e8ve and her mother in one of many stunning sets // 20th Century Fox\nFILM\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\nDirector: Jacques Demy.\nScript: Jacques Demy.\nStarring: Catherine\nDeneuve, Nino Castelnuovo,\nAnne Vernon, Marc Michel.\nLanguage: French. 91\nminutes\nLES PARAPLUIES DE\nCHERBOURG\n\u201cThe Umbrella\u2019s\nof Cherbourg is\na technicolour\nmusical\nmasterpiece\u201d\ncostume design and an\neven more beautiful cast,\nthis film is an aesthetes\ndream, and I can do\nnothing but praise the production team.

They want\nto reach us students as\nwell. And I must hand it\nto them, they\u2019ve doing a\ngreat job of reeling me in.\nAs a foodie, the problem\nwith South Kensington is\nit attracts pricey restaurants that hope to take full\nadvantage of the tourist\nclientele without any\nregard for the students that\nare lost in the sea of school\nchildren holding hands\nto cross the street. With\na branch on Pembridge\nRoad, a stone throw\nfrom one of Imperial\u2019s\nHalls of Residence and\na 20-minute walk from\nthe South Kensington\ncampus, they\u2019ve got the\nlocation on lock.\nTheir burgers come\nwrapped up in their\nbranded paper with a\nsticker to seal the whole\nthing up and remind\nyou of what\u2019s to come.\nPerfect to pick up to take\nwith you on the commute\nto campus. But, like\nPandora\u2019s box, be careful\nof where you open them\nup. From all the cheese,\nsauces and filling they get\nstuffed with, these burgers\ncan look like an explo-sion! Rather fitting with\nthe strong, hard-hitting\nflavours they employ to\nget their signature taste.\nIt\u2019s a messy endeavour but\nat the end of it all you\u2019ve\nconquered their beast and\ncan use their packaging to\nput it all away like it never\nhappened.\nTheir use of pickling\nreally sends some of\ntheir burgers from good\nto drool worthy just by\nthe smell when you peel\noff the sticker.

If I was\nto recommend anything to\nsomeone who hasn\u2019t been\nbefore, it would be this.\nTheir \u2018Smokey\nRobinson\u201d really lives up\nto its name.

This\none if the most different\nfrom all the other meat\nburgers. This is definitely\nthe lightest of all the\noptions, but you aren\u2019t\ngetting away easy.

Fans are finally getting\nexactly what they want!\nInthesameDirectasMysteryDungeonwasannounced,GameFreakunvieledalargeexpansionpackforPok\u00e9mon\nSword and Shield that they have been working on. Let\u2019s go over what is included.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nT\nhe main thing\nto come out of\nthe Pok\u00e9mon\nDirect was a\nbig announcement that\nGame Freak are working\non brand new DLC for\nSword and Shield. This\nDLC is coming out in two\nwaves: The Isle ofArmour\n(June) and The Crown\nTundra (November). This\nis big. According to Game\nFreak, this expansion\npack (selling for \u00a326.99\nfor BOTH expansions) is\nmeant to replace the usual\nincremental entry in the\nfranchise, e.g. Crystal,\nPlatinum, Ultra Sun/\nMoon. Personally, I am a\nhuge fan of this change.\nI always feel the need\nto buy every Pok\u00e9mon\ngame, so the fact that the\nadditional content can\nnow just be added to the\ngame rather than having\nto buy a whole extra version for some slight story\nchanges and extra end\ngame content is wonderful\nnews. So, what is actually\ncoming with this?\nThere will be slight\ndifferences in either\nversion, depending on\nwhether you get this pack\nfor Sword or Shield (e.g.\ndifferent Pok\u00e9mon). But\non the whole, whichever\ngame you have does not\nmatter much.\nThe Isle of Armour\nCurrently, we know\nmore about the Isle of\nArmour. It takes place on\nan Island to the east of\nGalar, rich with beautiful\nnature. The Isle ofArmour\nfocuses on the theme of\ngrowth. There is a dojo\non this island, where you\nbegin an apprenticeship\nled by the trainer who\nruns the dojo \u2018Mustard\u2019.\nMustard is an ex-cham-pion of the region, now\nmentoring Leon, the\ncurrent champion of the\nGalar region (until you\nkick his ass at the end\nof the game of course).\nWhilst training in the\ndojo you either train with\nKlara, a poison type user,\nif you have Sword \u2013 or\nwith Avery, a psychic type\nuser, if you have Shield.\nThey are also releasing\na brand-new legendary\nPok\u00e9mon called \u2018Kubfu\u2019\n\u2013 a fighting type Pok\u00e9mon\nthat is entrusted to you\nby Mustard to train until\nit evolves into \u2018Urshifu\u2019\n\u2013 a Pok\u00e9mon with two\ndistinct forms. Urshifu is\n\u201cWe are being\ngiven over\n200 Pok\u00e9mon\nthat have been\nleft out of the\ngame this time\nround\u201d\n\u201cThe Crown\nTundra has\na new form\nof co-op play\nwhich allows\nyou to journey\nwith friends\u201d\na powerful Pok\u00e9mon that\nis also getting a Gigantamax version for both\nforms: single strike (fight-ing-dark) and rapid strike\n(fighting-water). As well\nas this additional story\ncontent, we are being\ngiven over 200 more\nPok\u00e9mon that have been\nleft out of the game this\ntime round. You do not\neven need to buy the expansion pass to add them\nto your team \u2013 as long as\nyou get Pok\u00e9mon Home\nwhen it comes out later\nthis year, you\u2019ll be able to\ntrade these monsters from\nyour old games to the new\nones.\nThe starters are all\ngetting Gigantamax forms\nas well! My personal\nfavourite is Rillaboom\u2019s,\nwhich transforms it from\nlooking like a toned-down Donkey Kong into\na full-on heavy metal\ndrummer. As well as this\nthere are new fashion\nitems, new looks for\nthe Rotom bike, an exp.\nCharm, apricorns that can\nbe turned into pok\u00e9balls\nand more tutor moves!\nThe Crown Tundra\nThe Crown Tundra is\nthemed around the idea of\nexploration, taking place\nin a frozen wildland to the\nNorth of Galar. Like the\nIsle of Armour, you\u2019ll be\nable to find Pok\u00e9mon that\nwere not present in the\ngame at launch. Fitting in\nwith the theme, there is\nplenty to discover, from\nmysterious temples to a\ngiant tree growing in a\nplace where it doesn\u2019t\nbelong.\nA \u2018certain person\u2019\nappoints you as the leader\nof their exploration team\nin the Crown Tundra.\nCalyrex is the legendary\nPok\u00e9mon of this expan-sion. This psychic and\ngrass type is characterised\nby its graceful, regal\nmovements.\nThe Crown Tundra\nhas a new form of co-op\nplay which allows you\nto journey with friends\ninto Pok\u00e9mon dens deep\nunderground, beneath the\nfrozen tundra. Deep inside\nthe dens you will be able to\nfind all kinds of legendary\nPok\u00e9mon, including some\nbrand-new ones waiting\nto be found. Similar to the\nIsle of Armour, there will\nbe new clothing items to\npurchase too!\nOnce you have completed the entire game,\nthe Isle of Armour and\nthe Crown Tundra, there\nshould be plenty more\nbattle challenges waiting\nfor you.\nControversy\nPersonally, I am super\nexcited for this! With 2\nnew areas meant to be\nbigger than the original\nwild area, and a bunch of\nnew legendaries, what\u2019s\nnot to like? Well for most\npeople, the price. The\nmajority of concern that\nI am seeing online seems\nto come from the idea that\nGame Freak could have\njust included this all in the\nbase game \u2013 especially the\nreturning Pok\u00e9mon. I see\nwhere people are coming\nfrom with this; increasing\nthe development cycle\nfor this game in order to\nfit this all in could have\nworked.\nHowever, Sword\nand Shield are already\nmassive, and in order to\ntake the extra time for development it would have\nmeant delaying the game\npast the holidays. This\nwould have resulted in: a)\nno big title for Nintendo\nduring the holidays, b)\nworse sales of the Switch\nLite which released a\ncouple of months prior and\nc) a likely upset fan base\nwho have been waiting\nfor a mainline Pok\u00e9mon\ntitle on the switch since\nits release 3 years ago! I\nam of the opinion that this\nis a good thing. It means\nthat we got Sword and\nShield during the usual\nNovember Pok\u00e9mon\nrelease, and now we can\nlook forward to more\ncontent throughout the\nyear without having to\nbuy another incremental\ngame. There\u2019s nothing I\ndislike more than buying\na new Pok\u00e9mon game\nand playing through the\nsame story again for hours\njust to experience a small\namount of post-game\ncontent. I\u2019m looking at\nyou Ultra Sun and Ultra\nMoon.\nConcept Art for the Crown Tundra. It Looks Absolutely Stunning// press.pokemon.com\n\n"
