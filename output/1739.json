In fact, Imperial\nCollege has a wealth of\nfashion-centric activities\nand talents, from our very\nown Fashion and Design\nSociety to students within\nthe university who own\ntheir own fashion labels\n(yes they exist, what have\nyou been doing with your\nlife?). Look no further\nthan the end of Exhibition\nRoad and you\u2019ll come\nacross incredible exhibitions and curated\ncollections of legendary\ndesigners at the Victoria\nand Albert Museum\n(currently showcasing\nMary Quant\u2019s work, the\nrevolutionary who blessed\nthe Swinging Sixties\u2019girls\nwith their uniform: miniskirts and hot pants).\nGiven our location in\none of the world\u2019s fashion\ncapitals, it seemed a real\nshame that Felix had abandoned its fashion section\nfor so long. Flicking\nthrough the leather-bound\nvolumes of all our previously published issues,\nit\u2019s clearer than ever that\nwhat really marked the\nprogress of time and acted\nas a social barometer was\nnot political leadership\nor foreign and domestic\nconflicts, but the clothes\nwe wear and how we wear\nthem. Empires rise and\nfall but from the moment\nEve bit the apple and had\nher eyes opened to the\nallure of foliage-based\nlingerie, clothing has\nbeen humanity\u2019s one true\nconstant.\nTherefore, this year, at\nthe turn of a new decade,\nI\u2019m very excited to\nannounce the triumphant\nreturn of Felix\u2019s Fashion.\nYes, we understand that\nthe first issue of the\nyear has been and gone\nbut seriously, were you\nexpecting us to launch\non schedule and not\u2026\nfashionably late?\nWe\u2019ve got interviews\nwith our Fashion Show\ndesigners, reviews of\ncampus clothing offer-ings, and insights into the\nfashion industry already\nlined up and ready to go.\nHowever, like all revivals\n(such as poet sleeves\nand, bizarrely, codpieces)\nour continued survival\ndepends on social participation so pick up your\npen, Imperial-provided\niPad, or typewriter \u00e0\nla Tom Hanks and get\ninvolved by submitting\narticles to felix@ic.ac.uk\n(we\u2019re still setting up our\nown email).\nArt Adorned: A review\nL\nast November,\nthe auction\nhouse, Christie\u2019s\nLondon, became\nhome to \u2018Art Adorned\u2019 \u2013 a\nprivate selling exhibition\nwith an assemblage of\nOld Master Paintings and\nrenowned luxury fashion\nbrand Dolce & Gabbana\nhaute couture creations.\nThe fusion of these two\narts depicted princesses,\nempresses and noblewomen as a tribute to feminine\nbeauty. The designers also\nshowcased the lasting\ninfluence of art-historical\nmovements, such as\nRenaissance, Baroque and\nRococo, and their timeless\nimpact on fashion. These\nstyles flourished in Europe\nfrom the 14th to the 17th\nCentury and radiate extravagance befitting Dolce\n& Gabbana\u2019s celebrated\nluxury Italian heritage.\nTo highlight this, pieces\nof Italian furniturewere\nalso integrated into the\nexhibition.\nThe 2019 Autumn/\nWinter collections from\nDolce & Gabbana: Atla\nModa, Alta Sartoria and\nAlta Gioielleria, were\ndisplayed alongside devotional paintings with some\npieces of artwork incorporated into the fashion\npieces itself. For exam-ple, Madonna and Child\nby Domenica Ghirlandaio\nwas cross-stitched into the\ncorset bodice of an Alta\nModa organza dress, the\ngarment was then completed with ostrich feathers and velvet piping.\nThe original painting can\nbe found in The National\nGallery, Trafalgar Square.\nFollowing this theme,\nthe exhibition also held a\ncompletely cross-stitched\ndress displaying a floral\nensemble and Madonna\ndel Belvedere by Raphael.\nThe focal points were\ntwo show-stopping,\nhand-painted gowns, one\nof which presented a yellow and pink floral pattern\non waterfall illusion tulle,\nwhilst the other with gold\nBaroque style motifs extended onto an elongated\ntrain.\nHowever, the most extravagant item may have\nbeen the Alta Sartoria\ngreen velvet embroidered\nsingle-breasted jacket.\nThis featured peaked la-pels, collar and pockets\nembellished with a golden\nguilloche and a blood jasper button. Gold thread,\nsequins, pearls and crystals taking inspiration\nfrom the renaissance era\nwere enlaced in the green\ndamask item.\nOverall, it was a comprehensive assortment\nconstruing the embodiment of archetypal feminism in the 14th to 17th\ncentury in Italy. The auction collection itself is\nsuitable for high fashion\nenthusiasts and the exhibition enabled access for\nnew and younger audiences to appreciate the works\nof art. Although the exhibition is over, the pieces\ncan still be viewed online\nas a virtual tour on Christie\u2019s website.\nFASHION\nSyon Lee\nFashion Editor\nFASHION\nSimran Gill\nFashion Writer\nThe last time Fashion graced the pages of Felix // Felix\nWhere fashion and art meet // Christie\u2019s Images Ltd. 2019\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1739\nFELIX\n5\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMeghan Markle: Britain\u2019s racism wouldn\u2019t\nlet her sparkle!\nEamon Farhat writes about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision to withdraw from\nfrontline Royal duties\nCOMMENT\nEamon Farhat\nArts Editor\nA\nshock statement\nreleased by\nthe Duke and\nDuchess of\nSussex has outlined plans\nfor them to step back as\nsenior royals. No matter\nwhat side of this dire\nargument you are on, one\nthing is clear: this week\nhas seen unprecedented\nevents take place in the\nroyal family. There has\nnot been this much drama\nsince Prince Paedophile\ninsisted to Emily Matilis\nthat he wanted to be\nknown as Prince Pizza\nExpress instead. I do\nnot have a huge interest\nin the Royals but when\nMeghan Markle, a strong,\nindependent, self-made,\nAfrican American actress\nfirst entered the Royal\nfamily, an institution\nwhose history is steeped\nin a less than favourable\nview of people of colour,\nI was slightly perplexed.\nI remember thinking that\nit was the most ambitious\ncrossover since Harry\u2019s\nforay with the Nazi stripping brigade.\nAll jokes aside, Meghan\nMarkle gave such hope\nto me and other people\nof colour in the UK and\nacross the world. She had\nthe power to give astronomical visibility to the\nproblems faced and break\npeople\u2019s pre-conceived\nideas of what the western\nelites should look and\nact like. Unfortunately,\nMeghan Markle coming\ninto one of Britain\u2019s oldest\ninstitutions exposed an\neven older institution still\npresent in 21st\ncentury\nBritain: racism.\nHer first appearance in\nBritish press - when the\nnews of Harry and her\nrelationship was broken -as being \u201c(almost) straight\noutta Compton\u201d started\npainting her as an exotic\noutsider. An immediate\nverdict was not made\nstraight away by the press\nand the couple enjoyed a\nbrief honeymoon period,\nuntil suddenly, the mood\nchanged. Increasingly the\npress did not see her as\nbeing compatible with the\nBritish Monarchy.\nIt is sometimes hard for\npeople to understand how\nthe criticism of Meghan\nhas been racist. Many see\nher as a public figure who\nis being scrutinised like\nany other. When she took\nprivate jets while preaching about the climate\ncrisis, she was bashed\nfor being a hypocrite.\nThis seems fair but when\nyou read through other\ncriticisms that the same\npeople have of her, things\ndo not seem as rational\nand a more racialised\nnarrative emerges.\nWhen she ate avocados\nfor example, she was\naccused of causing mass\nmurder. When she held\na beautiful bouquet at\nher wedding, the press\ninsisted she was causing\ngrave danger to Princess\nCharlotte. And of course,\nher charity work with a\nMuslim Heritage Centre\nwas linked to terrorism.\nThese sorts of criticisms\nare extremely unfair\nand are reported on with\ninflammatory comments.\nUnlike Kate Middleton,\nthe perfect English rose,\nthe British press believes\nthat Meghan does not\nknow her place and must\nconform. Even small\nattempts at deviating from\nthe rule book have been\nmet with a barrage of criticism steeped in racism.\nWith the recent decision\nfrom Harry and Meghan\nto step back from their\nroles as senior royals,\nis the insidious feeling\nthat others are holding\nyou to a different standard\nbecause of what they see.\nMeghan\u2019s fall from grace\nin the eyes of the British\nmedia has shown that even\nif you have a successful\ncareer, marry a prince,\nand literally become a\nprincess with the best intentions in the world, your\nrace will always be what\npeople see and judge you\nMeghan Markle in happier times. Probably // Wikimedia\n\u201cMeghan gave\nhope to people\nof colour in the\nUK, and this\nrecent decision\nmight be very\nsaddening for\nsome \u201d\nthis whole debate about\nracism, which is usually\nswept under a massive\nUnion jack carpet, has\ncome out into the open.\nThe hardest thing about\nexplaining how all of this\nis steeped in racism is the\nwhite privilege it takes to\neven ask that question.\nWhen someone says\n\u201cgive me an example\u201d\nit\u2019s insulting. As a person\nof colour, I know exactly\nwhat racism feels like,\nbut it is not my duty to\neducate the very white\npeople who perpetrate it.\nRacism is not just being\ncalled names and slurs or\nbeing checked at airport\nsecurity. Racism for me\non first.\nMeghan gave hope\nfor people of colour in\nthe UK, and this recent\ndecision might be saddening for some, but I know\nthat the lovely couple will\ngo on to great things and\nfight for the very issues\nthat pushed them away. I\nwish them luck and praise\ntheir brave decision and\nhope that we reflect on the\nsocietal changes needed\nfor this type of thing to\nnever have to happen\nagain.\n\n"

From some\nof the more obvious snubs\n(namely Greta Gerwig\nfor best director), to\nsome more Uncut Gems\nwe wished could have\nmade it on the list (pun\nintended), there seems to\nbe something askew; but\nwhat\u2019s new?\nWith every year of\nOscar nominations there\ncomes a new wave of\ncriticism or controversy,\nand so this year were you\nreally expecting any dif-ferent? The long standing\nimbalance and unfairness\nin the academy stems\nfrom years of elitism in\nHollywood, manifested\nfrom systematic racism\nand sexism that has long\nbeen apparent. In this\nrespect, the film industry\nis still in recovery after\nhaving stood with such an\nimbalance for so long. In\n2012 a study conducted\nfound The Academy to\nhave a membership of\n94% white, 77% male,\nand 86% age 50 or older.\nThis is an absolutely\nunacceptable figure that\nclearly does not represent\nthe film industry as it\nstands today.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that\nThe Academy hasn\u2019t been\ntrying to diversify their\nmembership. Since 2016\nthey\u2019ve been committed\nto try to decrease some of\nthese numbers. Inviting\nmore women and minori-ties, each year has moved\na little closer to a more\nrepresentative version\nof the film industry as it\nstands today, and yet still\nan overwhelming misrepresentation endures.\nSo we know that there\u2019s\na huge imbalance in the\nvoting members of The\nAcademy, that much is\napparent, but what this\ndoesn\u2019t explain is the\noverwhelming praise that\nJoker has received this\nyear. I mean come on, 11\nnominations? Now a lot\nof these come from the\nbehind the scenes staff\nin costumes, make-up,\nsound editing and others;\nI can hardly claim to be\nany expert in any of these\nfields, but from what I can\ntell these are fairly just.\nSo it begs the question,\nhas there ever been such\na disappointing film\nthat excelled in so many\nspecific categories?\nBreaking down the\nawards in this way you\ncan really begin to see\nwhere the flaws lie. If I\n\u201cThe Academy\nhas a\nmembership\nof 94% white,\n77% male,\n86% age 50 or\nolder\u201d\n\u201cThe Joker is a\nFrankenstein\nof a film\nthat when\ndissected\ninto different\naspects,\nappears as\nthough it\nshines\u201d\nwere to select the perfect\nparts of different humans\nand combine them to one,\nI wouldn\u2019t have a perfect\nhuman, I\u2019d have a Frankenstein. In a lot of ways\nthis is what Joker is, it\u2019s a\nFrankenstein of a film that\nwhen dissected into different aspects it appears as\nthough it shines; the only\nglaring blunders I can see\nin this nomination are\nfor Best Picture and Best\nAdapted Screenplay, what\nwas the academy thinking\nhere?\nWith a wealth of excellent films this year, it\ndoes come as a welcome\ninclusion that Parasite\nhas been recognised as\none of the stand-out films\nof the year, receiving a\nhost of nominations including Best Director and\nBest Picture. Yet some\nequally brilliant films\nhave been given far less\npraise in this ceremony.\nWe saw Awkwafina take\nhome Best Actress in a\nComedy or Musical at\nthe Golden Globes for\nher excellent performance\nin The Farewell. But the\nbrilliantly moving film set\nin China, with outstanding\ndirection from female\ndirector Lulu Wang, has\nbeen given 0 nominations\ndespite being hailed as\none of the best films of the\nyear. This together with\nUncut Gems, A Portrait\nof a Lady on Fire, and\nothers (that you will have\nto forgive me for leaving\nout), showcase the real\nunfairness when you start\ncomparing them to what\nhave been nominated.\nAll three of these films\nmentioned are (in my\nopinion) worlds better\nthan the likes of Joker and\nJojo Rabbit, yet have been\nwholly excluded from this\nawards ceremony.\nI find myself wondering if the voting members\nof the Academy have seen\na lot of the Best Picture\nlong list of nominations,\nwhy the Oscars regularly\nonly highlight the \u2018big\u2019\nfilms of the year and often\nfail to negate some of the\nsmaller excellent films.\nLet\u2019s also not forget that\nThe Academy is an organisation compromised by\nhuge body of Hollywood\nelites where (in 2012)\none third of the members\nhad received an Oscar\npreviously. This damning\nstatistic really does point\nto the overtly clear fact\nthat the Oscars is merely\none great attempt at\nHollywood giving themselves one huge pat on\nthe back for another year\nof making millions in the\nfilm industry. With the\nexception of some of the\nsmaller categories appearing slightly more earnestly throughout the night,\nyou really do need to\nkeep things in perspective\nwhen considering what is\n\u2018good\u2019 by the numbers of\nOscars it wins.\nPerhaps one of the only\nupsides to the Oscars\nis year in year out, it\nhighlights the inequality\nin the film industry and\nbrings awareness to the\nsexism and racism instituted by the Academy as a\nsubsidiary of Hollywood.\nMore and more people\nare beginning to take\naction on this and a noticeable shift in people\u2019s\nattitudes towards cinema\nis moving towards greater\nand greater inclusivity. If\nnothing, the Oscars give\nsome very influential\npeople a huge platform\nwith which to convey a\nmessage on the state of\nHollywood, with some\nindividuals choosing to\nmake a statement.\nSo if you\u2019re watching\nthe Oscars this year,\nremember to take them\nwith a pinch of salt; the\nnominations are floored,\nthe ceremony is grandi-ose, and it lacks a true\nrepresentation of all that\nwas great in cinema this\nyear. The Academy is\ngetting better, but it\u2019s still\ngot a long way to go.\nJoaquin celebrating as Joker recieves 11 nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards // Niko Tavernise Warner Bros.\nand with a length of\n300ish pictures, I can\nconclude they probably\nhaven\u2019t. It easily explains\n\n"

We're all in\nthis because we love what\nwe do - that's why I, and\nevery student who works\non this team, puts in 110%\neffort pretty much every\nweek. For the students\nespecially, who make\nup the entire team apart\nfrom myself, this is in\nspite of coursework, in\nspite of exams, in spite of\neverything else that comes\nwith being an Imperial\nCollege student.\nWe love what we do.\nEven when we're tired and\ndrained, we all come in to\nthe office, and put together\na paper every week with\nas much diverse and\nthoughtful content as we\ncan muster. There are\nlitany of obstacles we\nface, but we always just\nmake it work.\nBecause we love what\nwe do, we want to get\nbetter. I think everyone at\nImperial can understand\nthe drive for excellence.\nThis year's Felix has\nproduced more content\n- by far - than any other\nyear in at least the last\ndecade, and possibly ever.\nThe 96-page anniversary\nissue published before\nthe end of term is far-and-away the largest (and, I\nthink, best) issue of Felix\never. We've all pushed\nourselves to the limit.\nSo we want to hear\nfeedback. We want to hear\ncriticism. That's how we\nget better. We don't take it\npersonally. We've openly\npublished letters that are\nhighly critical, even, and I\ndo my utmost to respond\nto every comment or\ncriticism directed our\nway whether publicly or\nprivately. Many changes\nhave been implemented\nas a result of those, and\nwe hope that those of\nyou paying attention have\nnoticed.\nWhat I want to do in\nthis editorial is outline\nsomething very impor-tant, however. There is a\ndrastic difference between\ncriticising Felix, and\ncriticising the students\nwho put in all that work.\nI didn't want to 'toot\nour own horn' with the\nprevious pargagraphs. I\nwanted to impress upon\nyou, the reader, that every\nperson on this team is a\nf*cking legend. I consider\nit the highest achievement\nof my year, and of my\nprofessional life thus far,\nto have built that team,\nbut it's only been possible\nbecause there are so many\nintelligent, passionate,\nand hard-working people\nat Imperial who also want\nto be involved with this\npaper. Every writer, every\neditor, every copyeditor.\nThat's why I feel\nincredibly defensive of\nthose people.\nMost times, when we\nmake a mistake, people\nare understanding. They\nknow that we don't have\nthe resources to output\na completely polished\npaper every single time.\nWe all thank you for that.\nWe thank you for your\npatience with the website,\nas well. And typically, for\nthose who are passionate\nabout the paper and\noffer feedback, I want to\nencourage them to join\nour little cult - make the\npaper better, if a problem\nwith it is bothering you. If\nyou feel there's an agenda,\nwrite for the opposite\nperspective - we will\naccept your article and\nwork with you. If you see\ncopy mistakes and it bugs\nyou, put the effort in and\ntake the step to becoming\na copyeditor.\nDespite all this posi-tivity, there are a small\nminority of people who\nhave, sadly, become increasingly venomous with\ntheir criticism.

    "content": "PUZZLES\nFRIDAY, 17TH\nJANUARY, 2020 FELIX\n8\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week Felix spoke to the Deputy President (Finance and Services), Fifi Henry, about the Summer Ball, The\nSustainibility and Services Board, and food in 568 and hbar.\nFelix: Lots of big\nprojects you\u2019ve\nbeen working on\nover the past couple\nof months and the\nChristmas break \u2013\nprobably the largest\nand most pressing is\nSummer Ball, which\nyou are leading on\nand organizing this\nyear. How is that\ngoing?\nFH: The background story\nto this is that previously,\nthe Summer Ball has\nsat with the Events and\nConference Manager in\nthe Commercial Services\ndirectorate. They left at\nthe start of October, and\nso there was nobody to\npick it up as it\u2019s a massive\nproject. The head of the\ndirectorate proposed to\ncancel the Ball, which was\npresented to the Board of\nTrustees \u2013 who provide\noversight of the Union\nfrom internal and external\nsources.\ndecided that the really\nimportant thing moving\nforward was for all of our\nservices to be sustainable\n\u2013 economically viable\nand environmentally\nfriendly \u2013 but the core of\nit is ensuring the students\u2019\nneeds are met, and that all\nof our services are doing\neverything for them.\nAgain, the SSB has a great\nset of dedicated students,\nand we decided there are\ntwo big things we wanted\nto do. One is to have a\nbig sustainability project,\nand the other is to look\ninto the staff welfare side\nof things \u2013 the different\npolicies that affect our\nstudent staff.\nThe overarching sustainability project is coming\ninto fruition this term,\nwith several campaigns\nbeneath it. The first is the\n\u2018Planetary Health Diet\u2019\ncampaign launching next\nmonth; it piggybacks off\nof \u2018Meat-Free Mondays\u2019\nfrom last year, but doesn\u2019t\npromote a vegetarian\nor vegan perspective as\nmuch. It doesn\u2019t tell you\nto remove meat from your\ndiet. It looks instead at\nwhat foods are best for\nyou in terms of health, as\nwell as those foods\u2019\nenvironmental impact. So,\nfor example, it promotes\neating things like chicken\nover consuming more red\nmeats, compares different\ntypes of nuts in terms of\nwater consumption, and\nso on. The idea is to get\nstudents to consider what\nthey are purchasing \u2013 it\u2019s\na knowledge piece, which\nis great. Last year, MeatFree Mondays helped\na lot of students realise\nthat things like beef and\nlamb have a much bigger\nenvironmental impact\nthan some might realise. It\npushes that positive effect\nfurther, highlighting foods\nthat are great for you as\nwell as the environment.\nThere\u2019ll be different activ-Fifi Henry, the DPFS // ICU\notherwise it would\nhave been cancelled.\nYou\u2019re still doing\neverything else the\nDPFS has always\ndone, with this on\ntop. Are you receiving support from\nother staff members\nin the Union?\nFH: There is support.\nMarketing have been\ngreat \u2013 we had a meeting\nto discuss what we wanted\nto do when we knew what\nthe theme was. They\nquickly drafted up some\nbeautiful posters; I really\nthink they are stunning, so\nI can\u2019t wait for everyone\nto see it on Monday.\nThere are people within\nthe Commercial Services\nremit who have definitely\noffered support, and there\nare people in Beit bars who\nhave worked Balls before\nand have a lot of experience and knowledge, and\nhave been able to provide\ninsight. I\u2019ve not run an\nevent on this scale before,\nso there are some concerns\nthere, but there\u2019s a good\nsupport network \u2013 and\neveryone on the Summer\nBall Committee all have\nrelevant experience and\nknow what they\u2019re doing.\nWithout them it wouldn\u2019t\nwork, so really credit to\nthat team to be honest.\nFelix: As big a project\nas this is, it\u2019s only\na part of your role.\nI know you\u2019ve also\nbeen doing a lot of\nwork with the Services and Sustainability\nBoard (SSB) recently,\nplanning several\ncampaigns. Can you\ntell us about those\nplans?\nFH: The SSB is a new\nboard approved by Union\nCouncil this year \u2013 more\nwork to do! \u2013 which means\nI could shape it however I\nwanted, which is really\nexciting. I could define\nits terms of reference. I\nI made the argument that\nit was a fundamental\npart of the student experience \u2013 that it not only\ncelebrates the end of the\nyear and their exams,\nand for many the end of\ntheir degrees as it\u2019s the\nbiggest event right before\ntheir graduations. We as a\nUnion don\u2019t do as many\nbig-scale events as maybe\nwe should, and don\u2019t do\nas many big recognition\npieces to celebrate all that\nour students do. I felt it\nwas really important that\nit still had to happen, and\nthe only way to make that\nwork was to take on the\nresponsibility myself \u2013\nbut I knew I could do it, as\nI\u2019d already reached out to\nseveral key student stake-holders, such as the Arts\nand Entertainment Board,\nDramSoc, and members\nof the student bar team,\nwho each are involved\neither in organizing or\nrunning the ball.\nThere are about 10\nstudents on the new\nSummer Ball Committee\nas a result \u2013 previously\nthe Ball was fully organised by staff members at\nthe Union \u2013 and we meet\ntwo hours every week\nto discuss and organise,\nsign off things like risk\nassessments, and so on.\nOur main project for\nfirst term was to create a\nbudget and break down\nthe costings of everything,\nand broadly defining our\nfinancial approach. The\nBoard agrees that the\nBall is not meant to be\na Commercial Services\nproject, rather a Student\nExperience project, and\nis not meant to be run in\norder to make a profit. So\nthe plan is for it to break\neven \u2013 and if a loss is\nmade, then as long as it\u2019s\nan experience students\nenjoy and are happy with\nthen we can absorb it\ninto the Union\u2019s financial\nreserves. If overspending\nslightly means students\nhave a good time, we\u2019ll\noverspend slightly.\nWe\u2019ve sorted out our\nheadliner \u2013 though we\naren\u2019t announcing it quite\nyet, we can confirm it\u2019s\na live act and not a DJ!\n\u2013 and the theme this year\nis \u2018Enchanted Forest\u2019. In\nthe past we\u2019ve suggested\noptions and had students\nvote \u2013 this year we put it\nout there for anything and\neverything to be submitted as ideas. We had some\nreally strange things come\nup in there, for sure, but\none of the most prominent\nthoughts that came up,\nand which the Summer\nBall Committee really felt\nwe could strongly deliver\nin terms of dressing the\nenvironment to fit the\ntheme, was enchanted\nforest. The posters\nshould be going up soon,\nas the \ufb02ash sale begins\non Monday at 12 \u2013 so\neveryone keep your eyes\nout for that! From there\nwe\u2019ll be slowly releasing\nmore information, setting\nup some fun initiatives\nwhich will allow people to\nget free tickets, and so on.\nI think a big difference\nthis year is that this year\nit is being organised by\nstudents, so it\u2019s a lot more\nrelevant to what students\nwant.Previouslytherewas\nlittle student input \u2013 there\nwere some consultations\ndone, but they weren\u2019t\nreally pushed. We\u2019ve also\ntaken on feedback\nthat people in the past\nhave spent \u00a350 on a ticket\nand felt they didn\u2019t get as\nmuch out of it as they\u2019d\nwant \u2013 so this year, we\u2019re\nraising the maximum\nticket value (by around\n\u00a315, but that\u2019s not fully\ncertain yet), but it will additionally include a main\nand dessert and a prosecco\nreception, as well as the\nfact that the headliner will\nbe a live act. It\u2019s small but\nsignificant experiential\nimprovements that don\u2019t\ntoo drastically affect\nticket prices.\nWe\u2019re also looking into\nsponsorship opportunities,\ntrying to get other organisations engaged and more\nmoney coming in we can\nmake something better\nfor students. So there\u2019s\na lot going on there, it\u2019s\nquite overwhelming, but\nvery exciting. I\u2019m hoping\nwe can change people\u2019s\nopinions about the Ball \u2013\npeople previously often\nfelt it wasn\u2019t worth the\nmoney, but came anyway.\nWe\u2019re hoping this year\nthey\u2019ll come anyway,\nand find that it was worth\nit \u2013 and feel that this was\nwhat they wanted to do to\ncelebrate the end of their\nyear!\nFelix: This is a colossal amount of work\n\u2013 and that\u2019s just been\ntacked on to your\nrole this year because\n\n"

With its\n895 pages of historical literary fiction, it\npresented a challenge and\nits mere appearance on my\nshelf demanded respect.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong.\nIt was not the page count\nalone that was terrifying - I\nfrequently devour colossal\nfantasy tomes without\ntrepidation. However, my\nreading pace significantly\nslows down when it\ncomes to works that err\ntowards a literary fiction\nstyle. There is something\nabout the genre that\ncommands your constant\nattention - and that can be\nexhausting.\nIn spite of my reserva-tions, The Crimson Petal\nand the White pleasantly\nsurprised me with its readability and robust writing\nstyle. Its enthralling storytelling pulled me in right\nfrom the first sentence,\nwhich goes like this:\n\u201cWatch your step. Keep\nyour wits about you; you\nwill need them. This city I\nam bringing you to is vast\nand intricate, and you\nhave not been here before.\nYou may imagine, from\nother stories you\u2019ve read,\nthat you know it well, but\nthose stories flattered\nyou, welcoming you as a\nfriend, treating you as if\nyou belonged. The truth is\nthat you are an alien from\nanother time and place\naltogether...\u201d\nEmploying an omniscient narrator is a tactic\nthat does not always pay\noff \u2013 but the world this\nbook was inviting me\ninto from my comfortable\nand well-lit bedroom was\nso richly gruesome, with\njust the right amount of\nlight to balance out the\ndarkness. A description of\nthe dim, cobbled street full\nof beggars and horse shit,\npouring rain and the smell\nof urine is almost enough\nto turn you away. But at\nthe end of that street is a\npub, light and warm, full\nof hazy patrons - and there\nis a story unfolding within\nit.\nAlmost voyeuristically,\nyou want to step closer\nand take a look; there is a\ntemptation to explore and\nexperience as you invisibly follow first one character then the next, in a\nmanner that is not dissimilar to Harry Potter\u2019s visits\ninto the Pensieve.

He achieves tangibility by not shying away\nfrom fearlessly describing\neven the most taboo of\ndetails - the protagonist\u2019s\nred and flaky skin that\nis likely psoriasis, the\nvarious liquids and\nvaginal douches prostitutes used to prevent\ngetting pregnant, the\nsounds and smells of the\nsewage-clogged streets.\nHe weaves them in\nexpertly, again and again\n\u2013 and the result is as vivid\nas a photograph.\nIndelicate and brutally\nhonest in its portrayal,\nthis wonderfully irreverent novel follows Sugar\n\u2013 a prostitute, yes, but\nperhaps more importantly\nan exceptionally intelligent young woman. She\nperforms her job well;\nso well, in fact, that she\nis known far and wide\nfor it. But what makes\nher unique is her shrewd\nability to hold conversation with the men that seek\nher out for a quick shag,\nbut then stay - and inevitably keep coming back.\nAs her life slowly and\ninexplicably intertwines\nfirst with high-society\ngentleman Mr. William\nRackham and then with\na cast of highbrow and\nlowbrow characters from\nall walks of life, she ends\nup changing the course of\nall their lives forever.

France is,\nwithout doubt, the second\nmost important economic\ndriver in the European\nUnion, after Germany.\nIt is also home to many\nnative European corporate\nconglomerates and banks,\nsuch as the Dassault\nGroup and BNP Paribas.\nSurprisingly, it is also\none the many countries in\nbreach of the Maastricht\ncriteria*. As seen in\nFigure 1, its proportion of\nindustrialized goods sold\nin the European Union\nwas standing at 12% in\n2017 (the most recent\navailable data), albeit sig-nificant, unproportionally\nsmall compared to the role\nFrance takes in the Eurosystem, being less than\nhalf of that of Germany\nand even smaller than\nItaly, a country deeply\nentrenched in economic\nstagnation and rising debt\nlevels.\nFrench Debt Levels\nBut what does this\ndata have to do with the\nprotests? The logic is a\ncomplicated one. One\nmust be aware that the\nFrench government has\nthe habit of borrowing\nin large amounts. Most\ncountries borrow, but\nFrance borrows uncon-FELIX\ntrollably. Sound economic\nstrategy requires a country\nto reduce its debt level\nduring periods of growth\nand the vice versa during\nrecession. France has\nnot recovered fully from\nthe 2008 crisis, evident\nfrom the accumulating\ndebt from the last decade\nseen in Figure 3. Refering\nto Figure 2 and Figure\n4, it begs questioning\nwhy, when Germany had\nturned into surplus in\n2014, France remained in\ndeficit to this day? If one\ndetermines it is the unsustainable pension system\nand public welfare of\nFrance being the culprit,\nthe author agrees that it\nis a major contributor. On\naverage, a Frenchman was\nexpected to receive a net\npayment of 890EUR from\nthe French national government in 2018. Though\nthis number has been\nsteadilyreducedinthepast\nyears, the French public\nseems to no longer accept\ncuts to their benefits. Is\nthe policy of cutting social\nwelfare necessary for\nFrance? Not if Emmanuel\nMacron can find ways\nto ask Dassault or BNP\nParibas to pay more tax.\nThough if he wishes to\ncontinue his presidency in\nthe next election, he must\nnot make these powerful\norganizations his enemy.\nAs expected, the French\npresident has once again\ndecided to demand more\nfrom his people than to\nthe ruling elite.\nFrom Figure 3, French\npublic debt stood at\n98.4% of GDP (2018),\nand its deficit on the rise.\nTo restrain from further\nbleeding, Macron had\nno other choice but to\nimpose the fuel tax with\nall of his reforms. In fact,\neven if Mr. Macron was\nselfless and demanded the\ncorporations to pay more,\nthe legislation would\nnever have passed in the\nparliament - nevertheless\nare these reforms and cuts\nenough to cause massive\ndemonstrations on the\nstreets of Paris? Perhaps\nnot, though the author\nbelieves they are merely\nthe fuse to larger social\ndiscontent. Let us examine\nit from an economic\nperspective: Eight out of\nevery hundred in France\nare currently unemployed.\nAnd within that eight\npeople, three are suffering\nfrom effects of long-term\nstructural unemployment.\nWhy is the unemployment\nrate so high in France? In\ncontrast the German rate\nhovers at only 3% and\nBelgium at 5%. It could be\nthe effect of overlapping\nbusiness cycles, which\nwould be an unfortunate\nY\nou must remember the\nname of the\ncurrent president of France, don\u2019t you?\nEmmanuel Macron. The\nFrench people voted him\ninto the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace in\n2017. The ones before\nhim? Nicolas Sarkozy,\na right-wing politician\nand Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,\na left-wing leader. As far\nas the author is aware, the\nFrench public is currently\nnot in good terms with any\nof the three. If the French\npeople do not like the\nright, the left, or the center,\nwhat is the problem? Is it\nthe rigid political system\nof the Fifth Republic or\nthat of the bureaucracy\nof the European Union?\nOr is it the shrinking\neconomy with increasing\npublic debt? The author\n\u201cIs the policy\nof cutting\nsocial welfare\nnecessary for\nFrance?\nNot if\nEmmanuel\nMacron can\nfind ways to\nask Dassault or\nBNP Paribas to\npay more tax.\u201d\ncoincidence. On a very\nmacroscopic scale, France\nenjoyed extensive growth\nafter the Second World\nWar, it should not come as\na surprise that the growth\nis slowing down. Unless\nthe France would like to\nsuffer the same fate of the\nJapaninthe1990\u2019s(thelost\ndecade), it must not allow\nlong-cycled economic\ngrowth to overheat and\nboil over. After the 2008\ncrisis, Germany recovered quickly afterwards\nbecause its economy was\ndeeply rooted in manufacturing and technology, but\nFrance was not. Its heavy\nFig 1.

Her\nradical designs provided\na personal means for\nother girls to break away\nfrom their parents and to\nstop dressing like their\nmothers. In 1966 she\nreceived the Order of\nthe British Empire \u2018for\njolting England out of\nits conventional attitude\ntowards clothes\u2019.\nThe 1960s in Britain\nwas a decade of massive\nsocietal change. Women\ncampaigned for equal pay\nand it became illegal for\nemployers to discriminate\nagainst women. The\ngreater availability of jobs\nallowed them to become\nmore independent at a\ntime when most women\ncouldn\u2019t open a bank\naccount without a male\nrelative\u2019s permission,\nenabling them to imagine\na life that went beyond\nthe centre of fashion\nduring les ann\u00e9es folles.\nHowever, clothes by\ndesigners like Paul Poiret\nand Coco Chanel were\nonly accessible to a small\nelitist clientele who could\nafford couture.\nMary Quant embodied\na similar shift towards a\nnew era of femininity in\npost-war 1960s Britain but\nshe democratised fashion\nby making clothes more\nfinancially accessible to\nworking girls. She was\nradical because instead\nof slavishly copying\nthe designs of Parisian\nfashion houses to be sold\nto British retailers, she\ndecided that street clothes\ndeserved to have their own\ndesigns. It worked to her\nadvantage that she studied\nArt at Goldsmiths and\nnot Fashion, her lack of\nformal training allowing\nher to rethink design\nfrom scratch and implement her own creative\nvision of what women\u2019s\nclothing should be like\n(\u201coptimistic, exuberant,\nyoung, flirty\u201d), capturing\nthe mood of the time and\ngiving an outward expression to women\u2019s greater\nfreedoms by creating\nclothes that were comfortable and enabled ease of\nimaginative and original,\nborrowing pinstriped\nshirts from men\u2019s designs,\npinafores and peter-pan\ncollars from children\u2019s\nclothes and prominently\nvisible buttons and zippers\nfrom industrial uniforms.\nHer most iconic\ncontribution, symbolic\nof women\u2019s growing\nautonomy over their\nown bodies, was the\npopularisation of the\nminiskirt - a garment that\nis to this day controversial\nin many countries and\nwhich remains a symbol\nof defiance and sexual\nempowerment in the Me\nToo era.

All it required\nwas a square block of\nmozzarella cheese and a\nproduction line of \ufb02our,\neggs and breadcrumbs.\nSounded simple enough\nuntil I realised I had never\nseen a square block of\nmozzarella cheese, nor\nwas I aware that they even\nexisted.\nNonetheless, all the\nyoutubers had them and\nso I decided to ignore that\nthought and put it down to\nme never having had the\nneed for it before. This\nwas quickly tarnished\nwhen I roamed the cheese\naisles of Asda, Sainsburys\nand Tescos only to \ufb01nd\nthe shelves stacked with\nendless variations of\ncheddar cheese and not\na single block of square\nmozzarella. I had no\nchoice but to settle for\nthe next best thing I could\n\ufb01nd which was a cylindrical mozzarella block.\nDue to this I was unable\nto make actual mozzarella\nsticks so I opted for more\nmozzarella discs.\nI \ufb01rst began by cutting\nthe mozzarella into circles\nroughly half a centimeter\nthick. I then set up the\nproduction line; placing\nthe \ufb02our, mixed eggs and\nbreadcrumbs into separate\nbowls. The mozzarella\nthen needs to be coated\nin \ufb02our, then eggs and\nlastly the breadcrumbs.\nTo ensure everything is\nfully coated it\u2019s best to\nre-coat it in the eggs then\nthe breadcrumbs again\nto make a double bread-crumb layer. This process\ngets very sticky and very\nmessy very quickly; to\nminimize this you can try\nusing one hand for the wet\ningredients and another\nfor the dry. Once \ufb01nished\nplace them on a separate\nplate.\nThe recipes that I\nlooked at suggested\nrefrigerating/freezing the\nmozzarella sticks for a\nfew hours before frying.\nHowever, I do not have\nthat level of patience so I\n\u201cI have been\nleft feeling\nwronged and\ndesperately\ncraving the\nbreadcrumb\ncovered cheesy\ndelight\u201d\n\u201cI knew that\nnothing would\nmeasure up to\nthe mozzarella\nsticks from\nFiveSixEight\u201d\nfried them straight away\nNothing went horribly\nwrong so I assume it isn\u2019t\na crucial step in making\nmozzarella sticks. To fry\nthe mozzarella discs, you\nneed roughly enough oil\nto drown a baby shark\n(or enough to allow them\nto \ufb02oat). Heat up the oil\non a medium low heat\nand make sure to wait\nuntil it is fully hot before\nadding in the discs. It\u2019s\nwise to use one of the\nless good-looking discs\nas a tester to check if the\noil was ready. Once the\noil is heated, fry the discs\nin batches of 4 or 5; you\ndon\u2019t want to overload\nthe pan as it will lower\nthe temperature of the\noil jeopardizing that all\nimportant crispy coating.\nThe mozzarella discs are\nready when the cheese\nstarts bursting out, when\nthis happens transfer them\nonto a lined plate to soak\nup the excess oils.\nI decided to make\nsome sweet chili sauce\nto go with it which, if\nyou haven\u2019t made before\nI fully recommend. It\u2019s\nreally simple to make\nand just requires putting\nchilies, sugar, water and\nvinegar in a pan and\nleaving it to boil for a few\nminutes.\nTo help me decide if\nmy homemade mozzarella\ndiscs measured up to the\nones from FiveSixEight, I\nwrote up a pros and cons\nlist.\nPros:\nThe mozzarella discs\nstill had that typical crispy\ncrusts reminiscent of\nthe mozzarella sticks at\nFiveSixEight as well as\nthe classic cheese pull.\nMaking them yourself\nis also much better value\nfor money. In total I spent\naround \u00a35 on 2 packets\nof mozzarella and bread-crumbs, I didn\u2019t need to\nbuy the eggs or \ufb02our as I\nalready had them at home.\nThis is just a little over the\nprice of mozzarella sticks\nat restaurants and you get\nconsiderably more for\nyour money.\nCons:\nThe mozzarella itself\ndid not taste the same as\nthe ones from restaurants.\nI found it to be a lot more\nbland and rubbery. This\nmight be because of the\nbrand I used or it may\nbe that commercialized\nmozzarella sticks use an\nadapted version of mozzarella that\u2019s not what you\n\ufb01nd at the supermarket. I\njust personally didn\u2019t like\nthe \ufb02avour of fresh moz-zarella, especially when\ncompared to the ones\nfrom FiveSixEight.\nAnother issue I had is\nthat I found it a bit unnerving seeing all the oil\nneeded to make the mozzarella discs. It\u2019s one thing\nbeing told that something\nis unhealthy and another\nto witness it for yourself.\nMaking them from scratch\nmeans can\u2019t turn a blind\neye to how bad it is for\nyour health. There is the\noption of baking them but\nit may mean compromising on the crispy textured\ncoating.\nAll in all, the mozzarella discs were good\nbut they just weren\u2019t as\ngood as the ones from\nFiveSixEight. However,\nI wouldn\u2019t be opposed to\nmaking them with a different type of cheese as the\nonly real issue was that I\ndidn\u2019t like the taste of the\nmozzarella. However, if\nI\u2019m completely honest, I\nknew that nothing I made\nwould measure up to the\nmozzarella sticks from\nFiveSixEight; I was just\nlooking for something to\n\ufb01ll the mozzarella shaped\nhole in my heart.\nNew year, new shape // Mariam Jallow\n\u201cI decided to\nmake sweet\nchilli sauce\nto go with it\nwhich if you\nhaven\u2019t made\nit before I fully\nrecommend it\u201d\n\n"

The fallacy is\nfalling to recognise that\nboth Labour\u2019s Brexit and\neconomic policies were\nunconvincing, and these\ntwo factors were resonating together to curate the\nfailure. Many Remain\nvoters are not fond of\nradical plans such as\nmass nationalisation, and\ndespite the media urges\non tactical voting, these\nvoters simply cannot\ntolerate Corbyn\u2019s Labour\nand turned to the Liberal\nDemocrats instead.\nThat\u2019s why Labour\nneeds to elect a leader\nwho can uphold the fundamental principles Labour\nstands for; to protect the\nrights and services for\neveryone in the country\nand Britons abroad \u2013 from\nfundamental human rights\nto the NHS; to address\nand end the climate crisis;\nto promote equality and\nwiden the path to social\nupheaval for the working\nclass. At the same time\nLabour needs to reconsider its economic stance,\nwhich was, frankly,\nself-marginalising and\ndissuading. By moving\nback to the centre ground,\nLabour will stop its\ndescent into a party for\nonly Londoners, activists\nand uni students, but\nremain as a broad church\nwith a moderate and\nrealistic set of economic\npolicies for a dynamic\neconomy with \u2013 as the\nconstitution itself puts it\n\u2013 a thriving private sector\nand high-quality public\nservices.\nAnd Starmer is the right\nperson for the job.\nDespitebeingamember\nof the shadow cabinet,\nStarmer kept a distance\nbetween himself and\nCorbynism. Most notably\nhe abstained, instead of\nopposed, the Welfare\nReform Bill introduced\nby the Conservative government in 2016. In the\nleadership election that\nsame year, he pitched his\nsupport to Corbyn\u2019s rival\nOwen Smith, a centrist\ncandidate. But at the same\ntime he isn\u2019t a vocal critic\nof Corbyn and the \u201cold\nLabour\u201d trade unionism,\nfor he has been voluntarily providing free legal\nadvice and representations\nto trade unionists since the\nThatcher era.\nKeir Starmer started\noff his career as a human\nrights barrister. He worked\nextensively on a pro bono\nbasis, representing many\nwho couldn\u2019t afford legal\nrepresentation in human\nright cases. This has continued after he obtained\nthe honour of appointment as Queen\u2019s Counsel.\nHe then worked as legal\nand policy adviser to the\nNorthern Ireland police\nand the government. From\n2008 to 2013 he served\nas the head of the Crown\nProsecution Service. He is\nalso a barrister for Human\nDignity Trust, a charity\naiming to defend LGBT\nrights throughout the\nCommonwealth through\nlegal means.\nHe stood opposed to\nmany policies of the Blair\ngovernment, believing it\nhas strayed too far from\nLabour values. In 2003 he\nvoiced that he believes the\nlegal advice Blair relied\non for the invasion of\nIraq was flawed \u2013 a stance\nlater confirmed in the Iraq\nInquiry in 2016.\nprotesters. He is also on\nboard with the Green New\nDeal, pledging for a green\nindustrial revolution to\ndecarbonise the economy.\nStarmer devoted his\nmaiden speech in the\nHouse of Commons to defending the Human Rights\nAct 1998, an Act the Conservative Party has long\nbeen pledging to repeal. It\nis the only comprehensive\nhuman rights legislation\nin our statue and the only\ndomestic legal protection\nBritish residents have\nagainst violations of\nhuman rights.\nWith the Tories holding\na majority of 80, the\ngovernment could blaze\nany bill through the Parliament with ease. The\ncountry needs a strong\nand effective opposition\nto hold the government\nto account, especially on\nmatters of human right\nand the climate crisis.\nAmong the contenders,\nStarmer stands out the\nmost with his strong, continuous history of sticking\nto Labour\u2019s principles;\nfighting for the many and\nthe ordinaries against the\nfew and the powerful, and\nsometimes the state. At\nthe same time \u2013 perhaps\na trait more appealing to\nthe middle-class voters\nin contrast to Corbyn, he\nis not a revolutionist to\nupset the system \u2013 for he\nwas the Director of Public\nProsecutions and has\nworked for several police\nforces \u2013 a very \u201cprime\nministerial\u201d appearance.\nIt\u2019s not hard to explain\nwhy he is the frontrunner\nin the leadership race,\nand rightfully so. He is\nthe natural choice for a\nmodern and electorally\ncapable Labour party.\nGeology students are as satisfied as Sade // Wikimedia\n\u201cAmong the\ncontenders,\nStarmer\nstands out\nthe most with\nhis strong,\ncontinuous\nhistory of\nsticking to\nLabour\u2019s\nprinciples\u201d\nIn 1995, when Shell\nattempted to dispose\nan offshore oil storage\nplatform into the ocean,\nStarmer joined Greenpeace to stop an ecological disaster. He fought for\n10 years in the McLibel\ncase, when McDonald\nsued two environmental\nactivists for libel for\nsending out leaflets on the\nstreet. Recently he has expressed support towards\nExtinction Rebellion\n\u201cThat\u2019s why\nLabour needs\nto elect a\nleader who can\nuphold their\nfundamental\nprinciples\u201d\n\n"

Speaking\nto Felix about receiving\nthe Honour, Dame Lesley\nRegan said:\n\u201cIt is a great privilege\nto be recognised in the\n2020 New Year Honours\nfor services to women\u2019s\nhealth. We have made significant progress in recognising how important the\nhealth of women is to the\nhealth of our nation. But\nthere is a long way to go\nbefore we can say that we\nhave maximised the potential benefits and impact\nthat we can achieve.\n\u201cAs President of the\nRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), I wanted\nto show politicians and\npolicymakers that the near\ntotal focus on maternity\ncare misunderstands the\nrole of women in society\ntoday. We should no\nlonger think of women as\ncharacters in a Margaret\nAtwood novel whose\nsole purpose in life is to\nproduce children. There\nis the whole of the female\nlife course to consider\nand maternity is just one\naspect.\n\u201cI want to help create\na society where women\nand girls can discuss their\nhealth openly, where they\nreceive the support they\nneed to stay healthier for\nlonger, and where our\ndecisions and choices\ndetermine the care that\nwe receive. This is not\nwishful thinking - it is\nwithin the grasp of the\ngovernment and the NHS\nto deliver.\n\u201cIn December the\nRCOG published Better\nFor Women, a clear\nstrategy to improve the\nlives of girls and women\nacross the UK.

Well,\nAntigone is the story of\nthe four children born out\nof his incestuous relation-ship. The two brothers\nPolynices and Eteocles\nare off at war with each\nother. After returning,\none is a hero and one is a\ntraitor, but both are dead.\nAntigone and Ismene,\ntheir two sisters, are left\nto deal with the grief and\nwhen Antigone insists\non honouring the \u201cbad \u201c\nbrother with a proper funeral things escalate very\nquickly.\nIn this version of\nAntigone, written by Lulu\nRaczka, much of this plot\nis not explored in much\ndepth in this production,\nwith a magnifying glass\nbeing held up to the\nrelationship between\nAntigone and Esmene.\nThemes of adolescence,\nindependance and sexuality are explored as well\nas the classic theme of\nmorality.\nThe opening, with the\ntwo teenage actors rising\nfrom the literal pit of dirt\nand getting ready to go\nout with a little Destiny\u2019s\nChild interlude is conducted with no dialogue\nand yet still manages to\nintroduce the strong bond\nbetween the sisters. The\nperformance begins with\na long opening babble\nabout the girl\u2019s big night\non the town. For those\nnot familiar with the\nstoryline, the plot itself\nwas not made clear until\nabout 20 minutes in.\nWhile this long opening\nbabble explores ideas\nof sexuality, there was a\nlack of direction leaving\nthe audience grasping for\nmore substance.\nThroughout the pro-duction, the colloquialism\ninjected into the tense\ndialogue sometimes\nwaters down the gravity\nof the themes being dis-cussed. Yes, this adaptation is meant to bring the\nstory closer to home for\nyoung people, but using\n\u201clike\u201d every other word\nisn\u2019t always the way to do\nit.\nOverall, the performance does hit home and\nmake the audience think\nabout themes that were\nnot present in the original\nstory. Antigone (played\nby Annabel Baldwin) and\nher younger sister Ismene\n(played by Rachel Hosker)\ncapture every last drop of\nthe audience\u2019s attention\nfrom start to finish with\ntheir urgent and powerful\nperformances. At one of\nthe tensest moments in\nthe play, Baldwin\u2019s mono-logue, where she exposes\nher internal struggles with\nwhat is right or wrong\ncuts through directly to\nthe audience. Hosker\u2019s\nfinal monologue dealing\nwith grief elevated the\nentire performance and\ncemented her in my mind\nas the real talent to watch\nfrom this production. If\nyou are looking for a truly\nmesmerising performance\nput together by lots of new\ntalent, this production is\nperfect for you, no prior\nknowledge needed!\nCirque du Soleil: Luzia\nC\nirque du\nSoleil\u2019s most\nrecent show\nto grace the\nRoyal Albert Hall stage\nis Luzia, a colourful creation said to be inspired\nby Mexican culture and\nsponsored by the country of Mexico itself.\nLuzia is, at times,\na display of the cast\u2019s\nimmense talent, however,\nthe overall show was\nplagued by a sense of\nmonotony. The acrobatic\nacts felt outdated, and\nthese were few and far in\nbetween random comedic\nactsthatwerefranklyquite\nunfunny. This included\nan extended whistling\nsequence, that might have\nbeen funny for the first\n3 minutes, but quickly\nlost its charm. There was\nno sense of urgency or\nenthrallment, bar a swing\nset sequence near the end\nof the second act. Additionally, a confusing importance was placed on an\nact which simply involved\nsome football tricks. Are\nwe all left to presume that\nMexicans like football?\nSome of the show\u2019s\nmain redeeming qualities\nwere its impeccable\ncostumes, sound and\nlighting design, and a\nnovel and creative display\nof waterworks. The\nmusic, although having\nan authentic feel to it, was\nmainly forgettable. The\nuse of puppetry was also\nmainly successful: lifesize\nbeetles, armadillos and\nants were, to my surprise,\ncuter than they were\ncreepy. A horse puppet\noperated by three men\ncame across as clumsy in\nthe first act, but served a\nbetter purpose later in the\nshow. Still, War Horse did\na better job with horse\npuppetry.\nAs aforementioned,\nan important role was\nbestowed upon a tall\nwaterfall which randomly\nappeared in the middle of\nalmost each individual act,\nalbeit in different ways\nevery time. A particularly\nimpressive use of this displayed the water falling\nin unique formations.\nA recurring philosophy\nduring the making of this\nshow seems to be \u2018when\nint doubt, soak everything\nwith a giant waterfall\u2019.\nJust when you thought\nthe water thing had been\noverused, the stage turned\ninto a giant pool, from\nwhich a cast member\nascends via a network\nof vines to swing around\ncountless times (just like\nP!nk has been doing for\nwell over a decade) alongside a giant puppet of a\ncheetah.\nUnfortunately, Luzia\ndoes not indulge in\nMexican culture nearly\nas much as it could\nhave. However, it does\nhave its visual moments\nof near-brilliance. An\nhonourable mention\ngoes to the curtain which\ndescends at the end of the\nfirst act. This curtain is\nintricately designed with\nMexican motives and\ngives a minimal amount of\nauthenticity to the show.\nOverall, Luzia is\nvisually striking but\nlacking in substance.

Regrettably, on\nthis occasion they were\nparticularly dismayed\nby the nature and extent\nof errors in the students\u2019\nanswers and, in a momentary lapse of judgement,\nvented their frustration in\nthe exam feedback. The\nstaff member regrets their\nchoice of language and\napologises to students for\nthe offence this caused.\u201d\nThe controversial\nreport was made available on the department\u2019s\nsharepoint \u2013 a document\nmanagement and storage\nsystem used across the\nCollege \u2013 and was visible\nto students. The document\nhas since been removed.\nThe document sparked\nfrustration and anger\namongst students, particularly amongst the stress of\nthe ongoing 2020 January\nexams, which several\nstudents had begun to vent\nabout on social media.\nPrior to being removed,\nclips of the report were\nshared on Facebook,\nreading in full: \u201cthese\nare trivial errors, which\nshould normally lead to\nstudents failing not only\nA-levels but even GCSE.\nHow these students got\ninto Imperial is hard to understand\u201d, and \u201cI am very\ndisappointed. It looks like\nthe number of particularly\nweak or particularly lazy\nstudents is unusually large\nthis year.\u201d\nThe reports are designed and intended to\nprovide feedback to students post-exam.\nA College spokesperson said: \u201cWe regret that a\nrecent exam report available to Aeronautics students on the department\u2019s\nsharepoint site contained\ninappropriate comments\nabout the general results\nof an exam from last\nyear. The intention of representatives also\ncriticised usage of the\nplatform for launching\nanonymous personal\nattacks \u2013 rather than going\nthrough structures such as\nthe reps and the Student\nStaff Committee \u2013 and\nbelieved the situation on\nsocial media was \u2018getting\nout of hand\u2019.\nThis follows on from\ncontroversy last year over\nan open letter submitted\nto the Aeronautics department by second-year\nstudents \u2013 the same cohort\nabout which the exam\nreport was written last\nyear \u2013 complained about\nunfair courseloads and\nstress levels. The letter\nreportedly caused friction\nbetween academic reps\nand staff in Student Staff\nCommittees, after several\nrepresentatives expressed\nfrustration that their\nconcerns were shut down\nwith comments such as\n\u201cindustry doesn't push\nback deadlines.\u201d\nSeveral students,\nhowever, have anonymously expressed the\nsentiment that the department is making efforts to\nimprove, and commented\nthat the lecturer in question was \u201cgood in-class.\u201d\nAeronautics is not the\nonly Engineering department to have experienced\ndifficulties this January\nexam season. The Bioengineering department also\nreceived complaints after\nan exam was delayed by\nalmost an hour and a half.\nThe issue was reportedly\ncaused by a conflict\nbetween the College's\nanti-virus software and\nsoftware needed for the\nexam.\nA spokesperson for the\nDepartment of Bioengineering said: \u201cWe are\nsorry that an unforeseen\ntechnology issue involving the College\u2019s anti-vi-rus software caused a\ndelay to the start time of a\n3 hour live programming\nexam for 2nd year Bioengineering students.\n\u201cAs soon as the Department became aware of the\nissue, which was outside\nof our responsibility and/\nor control, we alerted ICT\nto find a solution. In order\nto minimise disruption\nto students and prevent a\nknock-on effect on their\nrevision for other exams,\nwe opted not to reschedule the exam - instead ICT\nsought a solution while\nstudents remained in the\nroom. The exam began\napproximately 1h and\n25 minutes after it was\nscheduled to, and students\nwere given the full time to\ncomplete it.\n\u201cWe understand the\nfrustration this will have\ncaused during an already\nstressful time and are very\ngrateful to our students\nfor their patience and help\nas we worked to find a\nsolution.\n\u201cThe Faculty of Engineering team are working\nwith ICT to ensure similar\nissues do not arise in\nfuture. We will liaise with\nour 2nd year students\nregarding the issue via\nthe Staff Student Liaison\nCommittee, and the issue\nwill also be reported to\nthe Board of Examiners\nto consider and note its\nimpact on the students.\"\nThis did, however,\nprompt some students to\nquestion how the issue had\nnot been caught before the\nexam took place.\nClips from the exam report, reposted to social media before the report was taken down from sharepoint // IC\n\u201cHow these\nstudents got\ninto Imperial\nis hard to\nunderstand\u201d\nthese reports is to provide\nuseful feedback to students taking exams.

    "content": "Once: The Musical\nThe tale of two strangers connected through music\nA\ndapted from\nthe 2007 indie\nmovie of the\nsame name,\nOnce first made its stage\ndebut on Broadway in\n2011. For a long time, the\nmovie has been one of\nmy all-time favourites -desperately romantic and\ngut-wrenchingly realistic,\nall topped up with the\nwonderful music written\nby Glen Hansard and\nMark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1, who\noriginally played the lead\nroles in the movie.\nOne of the biggest\ndebates surrounding\nOnce, both the movie and\nthe stage show, has been\nwhether it is a musical, or\nsimply a movie (or play in\nthis case) that happens to\nhave music in it. Well, it\u2019s\nslightly complicated.\nOnce focuses on two\nmusicians, simply called\n\u2018Guy\u2019 and \u2018Girl\u2019, who\nmeet at possibly what is\nboth exactly the right time,\nand the worst possible\ntime for them to meet, and\nform a formidable bond\nthrough sharing their\nmusic with one another.\nSimply put, the songs are\n\u2018written and performed\u2019\nby the character, be it in\npubs, in recording studios,\nor just to each other, and\nunlike the traditional\nmusical, are not simply\nplot advancement devices.\nHowever, as the songs also\nrepresent the thoughts and\nfeelings of the characters,\neither when they are being\nwritten, or as they are\nbeing performed, they do\na more than adequate job\nas a so-called plot device.\nAnd, boy, are the songs\nexceptional.\n\u201cThe real\nbeauty of the\nstaging is the\nstarry sky\noverlooking\nDublin\u201d\nCast Recording countless\ntimes. \u2018Falling Slowly\u2019,\none of the first songs in\nboth the play and the\nmovie, won an Oscar\nand was nominated for a\nGrammy, which is quite\na feat for an indie movie.\nPowerful gems such\nas \u2018Leave\u2019 and \u2018When\nYour Mind\u2019s Made Up\u2019,\noriginally performed by\nGlen Hansard, do lose\nsome of their grit through\nsome much-expected the-atricalisation. However,\nthe new arrangements,\ncomplete with breathtaking build-ups and airtight\nharmonies, absolutely\nmake up for this change in\ntone, giving it a new sense\nof power. Additionally,\nthe effective use of the\n\u2018Falling Slowly\u2019 motif\nthroughout the play is,\nalthough nothing new in\nmusical theatre history,\nexecuted marvellously,\nevoking a sense of love so\nhopeless that it hurts.\nCarrying the beautiful\ntunes written by Hansard\nand Irglov\u00e1 are a magnificent group of musician-ac-tors who play instruments\non stage, adding to the\ncosy, intimate atmosphere\nof the set design. The cast\nis led by Daniel Healy\nand Emma Lucia, who\nnot only hold their own,\nbut excel in filling the\nlarge shoes left behind\nby Hansard and Irglov\u00e1,\nas well as Steve Kazee\n(Tony winner for the role)\nand Cristin Milioti (later\nrose to prominence as\n\u2018The Mother\u2019 in How I\nMet Your Mother), who\noriginated the roles on\nBroadway in 2011.\nThe set, designed\nto resemble a pub\nsomewhere in Dublin,\nis impeccable too. The\nshow spans many loca-tions, which are brought\nto life by the excellent\nand varied use of props.\nHowever, the real beauty\nof the staging is the starry\nsky overlooking Dublin,\nrevealed to the audience\nas the ceiling of the pub is\nlifted and the floor of the\nstage lit up to resemble a\nnighttime skyline. Czech\nsurtitles are used to represent that the characters are\nsupposed to be speaking in\nCzech. At one point in the\nplay, the surtitles switch\nfrom translating English\nto Czech to the other\nway around, creating a\nsubtle yet wildly romantic\nmoment.\nTo answer the original\nquestion, Once is neither\nand both. Compared to\nthe movie, which simply\nfollows the two main\ncharacters\u2019 journeys\nthrough their music, the\nstage production definitely has an increased sense\nof audience engagement.\nThis is largely due to\nthe impeccable musical\narrangements, which hand\nover some of the pivotal\nsongs (such as \u2018Gold\u2019) to\nthe excellent ensemble.\nWhether a musical or a\nplay with music, Once is a\ncomplete marvel, striking\nthe perfect balance\nbetween fairytale and real\nlife. Not simply a love\nstory, it is a story about\nlife, the power people\nhave to change it for the\nbetter, and the importance\nof right timing for some\nthings to fall into place,\nand others to fall apart.\nIt is as much a breath of\nfresh air now as it was\nwhen the movie first came\nout more than a decade\nago.

My immediate thought was that this\nwas a designer hoodie\nemploying a trendy but\nalso ironic logo, the likes\nof which Balenciaga\nand many others have\nridden to the top over the\ncourse of the last decade.\nBalenciaga\u2019s Creative\nDirector Demna Gvasalia\neven went as far to play\non the Mastercard logo\nfor their SS20 collection,\nperhaps as a comment on\nconsumerism in the indus-try, more likely because\nthe Mastercard logo is\ninstantly recognisable. A\ncloser look at the hoodie\nin the cafe revealed that\nI was sadly mistaken as\nthe hoodie was from a\nconference sponsored by\nthe credit card company.\nIf the 2010\u2019s, especially\nthe late 2010\u2019s, are to\nbe remembered for any\nsingle trend, it must be\nlogomania.

The last\ndecade has been all about\ntelling everyone, in no\nsubtle way, who you are\nwearing.\nRather than focusing\non distinctive silhouettes\nwhich have defined\ndesigners throughout\nthe history of fashion,\ndesigners over the last\nten years have become\ndependent on instantly\nrecognisable logos for\nfear of being forgotten\nabout at fashion week or\nworse, scrolled past on\nsocial media. Instagram\u2019s\nimpact on fashion has\nbeen widely reported, and\nthe rapid turn to relying\non logos is butone feature.\nLogos meant likes, likes\nmeant increased reach,\nand increased reach\nultimately means more\nmoney for Bernard\nArnault and his designers.\nFor any designer to reach\nthe upper echelons in the\n2010\u2019s, creative use of\nprints and collaborations\nwere paramount along\nwith, of course, crafty use\nof \u201cInstagram influencers\u201d.\nInstagram has been\ntrialling the removal of\nvisible likes from the\nplatform throughout\n2019. If the platform is to\nremove likes completely\nfrom the platform in 2020,\nwe could see a paradigm\nshift in fashion design\nand marketing, unleashed\nfrom the shackles of\nscrolling. Removing\nvisible like counts would\nencourage creative\ncontent to be appreciated\nfor what it is, not its\nnumber of double-taps.\nThis is a shift so great\nthat Instagram\u2019s decision\ncould dictate future trends\nmore so than any single\nbrand or collection this\nyear. The most dramatic\nchange could be one of\nconsumers looking en\nmasse for trends outside\nof Instagram completely,\nrelying on new sources of\ninformation and perhaps\nreturning to traditional\nforms of fashion journal-ism.\nand, in recent years, I\nhave clung to designers\nlike Iris Van Herpen for\nhope of something more\nin fashion\u2019s future (who\nI highly suggest looking\nup if you have not seen\nher work). Popularity of\nthese collections seem\nimpossible at the moment\nfor their expense and the\nsustained attention they\nrequire for consumers.\nThe end of likes and the\nsubsequent change of\nattitude on social media\ncould enable a new generation of designers to\nexplore complex, nuanced\ndesigns once again\nwithout the demand of\nevery collection needing\na logo t-shirt and hoodie\nto be successful. On the\nother hand, Instagram\nremoving likes might\nallow TikTok to take\nits place as the fashion\nmarketing social media.

This should not\nbe surprising. Given that\nPostgraduates are not\nmembers of their Faculty\nCU, and since their engagement with the GSU\ntends to be fairly limited,\nbe familiar with, or even\naware of, these organi-sations. But this hasn\u2019t\nalways been the case.\nUntil 2012, PGs were\nmembers of both the\nGraduate Students\u2019 Association (predecessor to the\nGSU) and their relevant\nFaculty CU. There was a\nclear division of responsibility between the GSA,\nwhich was responsible for\nrepresenting the interests\nof Postgraduate students\nacross the College, and the\nFaculty CUs, which were\nresponsible for building a\nsense of Faculty commu-nity. In 2012, following\nscarcely any consultation\nor scrutiny, PGs were\nstripped of their Faculty\nCU memberships and the\nGSA was elevated to the\nlofty status of Constituent\nUnion. This experiment\nhas failed, and has led to\nfurther atomisation and\nisolation of the Postgraduate community.\nFor those who have not\nhad much involvement\nwith Faculty CUs, it\nmay seem odd to suggest\nPostgrads ought to be\ninvolved with them. After\nall, all they do is organise\npiss-ups, right? Well,\nnot really. Consider the\nRCSU \u2013 yes, there are\npiss-ups (and good ones,\nat that), but there\u2019s a lot\nmore. Broadsheet. The\nRCSU magazine, which\nhas in the past featured\nPostgraduate writers.\nScience Challenge, their\nscience communication\ncompetition, which every\nyear relies on Postgraduate judges. BAHFest,\ntheir annual comedy\nevent, which is run by a\nPostgraduate. By barring\nPostgrads from engaging\nin these endeavours and\nexperiencing the rich\nsense of history and\ntradition that the Faculty\nCUs offer, both the PG\nexperience and the activities of the Faculty CUs are\ndiminished.\nThere has been a lot of\nopposition to undoing this\nblunder, in recent years.\nWhile I don\u2019t have the\nspace here to dissect their\narguments in detail, they\nmostly rely on an implicit\nassumption that Faculty\nCUs are somehow fundamentally Undergraduate\nin nature, and that catering\nto Postgrads would be a\ndistraction. I hope that\nour present CU leaders\nwill put this idea aside,\nand with a little historical\nperspective and a little\nboldness, take steps in the\nright direction. They will\nsee how including and\nengaging each and every\nsection of our diverse\nFaculty communities,\nUndergrad and Postgrad\nalike, will reap dividends,\nfor the benefit of us all.\n\u201cUntil 2012,\nPGs were\nmembers\nof both the\nGSA and\ntheir relevant\nFaculty CU\u201d\nthey have little reason to\nThe Role of Postgraduates in Faculty Unions\nCONSTITUENT UNION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

Again,\nit\u2019s an awareness and\nknowledge piece about\nthe issues and impact of\npalm oil on our planet.\nThe third is looking into\npackaging waste, and\ntrying to reduce it. Then\nthere\u2019s also Greening\nImperial week, which\nis February 10th-14th.\nGreening Imperial and\nFrancesca, the Ethics and\nEnvironment Officer,\nhave organised different\nthemes and activities for\neach day. The first day\nis themed around food,\nand we\u2019ll be tying the\nPlanetary Health Diet\ninto that \u2013 more info will\nbe available soon via the\nUnion Facebook page.\nFelix: Attached to\nthe SSB is the Services Working Group\n(SWG) \u2013 which I believe looks at the other half of the SSB\u2019s\nremit, to do with staff\npolicy. What\u2019s happening there?\nFH: The SWG is a very\ntemporary group \u2013 it\nprobably won\u2019t exist\nbeyond this year. The\nmembers are student\nrepresentatives from 568,\nhbar, and the Union Shop,\nand the goal is to review\nsome of the policies affecting student staff \u2013 such\nas the Food and Drink\npolicy put into place last\nyear. There\u2019s also currently no official policy\nof ours for relationships\nbetween student staff\nmembers, so we default to\nthe College\u2019s one, which\nis not necessarily quite\nright for the environment\nour students work in.\nFelix: What is that\n\u201ceffective\u201dpolicy borrowed from College?\nFH: You have to declare\nyour relationship, and\nthen it is up to your line\nmanager in what capacity\nyou can work together \u2013\nso it\u2019s a very case-by-case\nbasis depending on the\nline manager. That\u2019s very\ndifficult to manage in a\nstudent bar, and it\u2019s also\na space where you do\nsee relationships blossom\nbecause the bar staff are\nvery close and social. You\nshouldn\u2019t be penalised\nfor that, stopped from\nworking shifts together or\nin the same bar together.\nIt also doesn\u2019t make sense\nwhen these are students\nwho might need to work\nfor financial reasons. I\ndon\u2019t fully know how\nmuch the policy has\nactually been implement-ed, but it clearly needs to\nbe reviewed.\nLondon Living Wage\n(LLW) has also come\nup in that conversation,\nas well as how various\nbenefits from working in\neither the shop or the bars\nwork, and what initiatives\nshould be in place to make\nsure it\u2019s an enjoyable\nplace to work.\nFelix: How will those\ndiscussions be applied or implement-ed?\nThe SWG is a subgroup\nof SSB, which is then a\ncommittee of the Union\nCouncil \u2013 the highest\ndemocratic body the\nUnion has, constructed of\nstudents\u2013andwasseparated out because we didn\u2019t\nwant the issues with bars\nand shops to dominate the\nSSB meetings. Anything\nwe come up with will feed\nback through to Council\nfor voting and potentially\npassing into policy.\nThe LLW is a much\nbigger-picture discussion,\nbecause it has a bigger\npotential ramification for\nother areas of the Union\n\u2013 but we can start a discussion here.\nFelix: With annual\nbudgeting due soon\nfor clubs and socie-ties, it seems a good\ntime to revisit a topic\nwe covered in our\nprevious interviews \u2013\nyour plans to develop\nadditional financial\ntraining materials for\ntreasurers and chairs,\nusing your extensive\nexperience as DPFS.\nHow\u2019s that going?\nFH: I spent Christmas\n\u2013 including Christmas\nDay \u2013 laying out the\nfundamental framework\nfor how I want it to look.\nI also sent out a survey to\nall club officers around\nfinance training, asking\nfor feedback on our\ncurrent training \u2013 what we\ndo well, need to improve\non, and what we don\u2019t do\nat all. That feedback is a\nreally useful exercise for\nmyself, the DPCS, the\nStudent Development\nManager, and head of\nStudent Experience to effectively review training.\nWhat we need is a system\nsuch that if someone did\nnot get a good handover\nfrom their predecessor,\nthey would have access\nto materials immediately \u2013 and we need to go\nabove and beyond current\nsystems like Officer\nAcademy, which is great\nbut is also capacity-limit-ed and is only on one day.\nIf someone can\u2019t make\nthat, and their query isn\u2019t\ncovered in the general\nmaterial we have, where\ndo they go?\nIt\u2019s been interesting to\nsee people have questions\nyou would assume they\u2019d\nknow from the start \u2013\nbut they don\u2019t, because\nit\u2019s something that fell\nthrough the cracks. Then\nthe question becomes:\n\u201cthis student now knows,\nbut does everyone else\nknow or is everyone lost?\u201d\nSo it\u2019s going to be a really\nuseful tool for future clubs\nand societies and will\nsupport their growth.\nFelix: Atop the training review, I believe\nthere is going to be a\nreview of how contracts are dealt with\n\u2013 at the moment, any\ncontract from any of\nthe 350ish clubs and\nsocieties goes directly to you to sign,\ncorrect?\nFH: There is difficulty\nwith contracts being sent\nvia email. I do my emails\nfrom oldest to newest \u2013 so\nif you send me something\nthat is urgent, and I have\nany kind of backlog of\ncontracts to go through,\nI might not be able to\nget to yours in time.\nContracts require careful\nreading \u2013 I am personally,\nindividually responsible\nfor the financial decisions\nmade for seven years af-terwards. I can\u2019t just sign\nthem off; so they take at\nleast a certain minimum\ntime to review properly.\nA new system on eActiv-ities has been started, but\nwe need to assess how realistically that will speed\nup the process. It shifts the\ncontracts from the DPFS\u2019\nemails to eActivities, and\nmakes improvements that\nmight for example highlight parts of a contract\nthat have changed but not\nothers, but how much will\nthat make an impact on\nspeed?\nThere are a lot of major\nprojects going on, so this\nwill take place over the\nlonger period \u2013 but it\u2019s\ndefinitely on my radar and\nme and the Systems Team\nwill be looking at it most\nlikely in third term.\nFelix: Talking about\nfinances \u2013 there\u2019s\nbeen a lot of chatter about the Union\nand College\u2019s ne-gotiations. A lot of\nstudents have heard\nabout the rent rene-gotiation, but just as\nessential is the block\ngrant renegotiation.\nHow is that develop-ing?\nFH: For clarity, the block\ngrant is the chunk of\nfunds the College gives\nto the Union for various\ncosts such as staffing.\nEither yearly or every\nthree years, the Union and\nCollege will renegotiate\nthat amount, and this is\none of those years; we\u2019re\ncurrently looking to set up\na one-year grant this time,\nas with the departure of\nthe Managing Director\nwe\u2019re looking to create a\nshorter one-year 2020-21\nStrategy \u2013 rather than the\nmore usual three-year\nStrategy.\nAs an example, if we\nwanted to ensure the LLW\nas a minimum pay rate\nfor staff (student or oth-erwise), we would need\nto assess the impact on\nour staffing costs and that\nwould play into the block\ngrant negotiation with the\nCollege.\nThe actual negotiation\nhas been pushed back to\nEaster, as not having a\nManaging Director has\nthrown up disruptions\nwithin the Union and\nour priorities have had to\nchange in terms of what\nprojects we are working\non. To give us time to\nre-evaluate, we didn\u2019t\nhave that discussion in\nfirst term.\nThe Officer Trustees\nand Senior Management\nGroup \u2013 the senior-most\npositions in the Union that\nform the Leadership Team\n\u2013 are meeting frequently\nto start looking at what\nwe want moving forward,\nwhat we can ask for, and\nwhat we think the College\nshould support for us as\nan organisation and for\nthe students.\nFelix: Finally, there\u2019s\na conversation to\nbe had about the\nfood situation \u2013 in\n568, but also in hbar.\nWhat timeline can\nwe expect for food to\nreturn?\nFH: With 568, we\u2019re\nworking with the College\nEstates team to ensure the\nkitchen \u2013 which has been\nrefitted and whose issues\nhave been resolved \u2013 is\nfully up to standard before\nwe put food service out.\nThe plan was to have it\nbegin in the coming week;\nhowever, right now we\ndon\u2019t have a confirmed\ndate. We\u2019re hoping it will\nbe sooner rather than later.\nIn terms of hbar, we\u2019re\nworking with College\u2019s\nCampus Services to sort\nout the space in the hbar\nkitchen in order to install\ntwo new pizza ovens,\nwhich we already own.\nWe\u2019ll need some new\nequipment and to ensure\nthe space for that, too. But\nas soon as that\u2019s sorted,\nwe can train student staff\non how to use the ovens\nand then roll it out. We\nwere hoping for it to be\nnext week as well, but\nthere has been a delay.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, but the\ngood thing is that we are\nvery much in progress\nand it should be arriving\nsooner rather than later.\nWe\u2019re working well with\nCollege to ensure food\nservice can get back out to\nstudents.\nFor more information on\nthe food situation, see the\nNews section.\n\n"

It is of\ncourse a problem of many\nparts, and in this article, I\nshall examine some of the\nattempts made to dissuade\ncrime and explain what I\nthink are the best methods.\nFirst off, I\u2019m going\nto (probably incorrectly)\nsplit criminal acts into\ntwo different categories.\nIrrational crimes (crimes\nof passion), and rational\ncrimes (premeditated\ncrimes). Irrational crimes\nare crimes that people\ncommit without putting\ntoo much thought into\nthe immediate aftermath.\nRational crimes are crimes\nthat people tend to make\npodcasts about 20 years\nlater and demand a certain\namount of forethought\nprior to the commitment\nof the crime.\nPreventing both types\nof these crimes using the\nsame methodology is not\npossible. Irrational crimes\nare far more challenging\nto prevent, although it is\npossible. Rational crimes\nhowever, can be prevented through deterrence.\nDeterrence is compli-cated. I would propose\nthat, assuming every\nparticipant is rational,\ndeterrence is 100% effective only when there is\nno win condition for the\nparticipant that wishes\nto perform an act. This\noccurs when the consequences of an action are\nterrible and also certain,\nor terribly certain. To\nabstract away from the\nindividual, let us consider\nthe main way that peace\nwas and is maintained in\nthe modern world. The\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) doctrine\nhas been a centrepiece of\ninternational diplomacy\nsince the advent of nuclear\nweapons. For two states\nconsidering attacking one\nanother, there has to be a\nmotivation, for example,\nsome territory that they\nwish to acquire, and there\nhas to be a win condition,\nwhere they acquire that\nterritory at a reasonable\ncost. MAD ensures that\nthere is no such thing as\na reasonable cost for any\ngoal that a nation wants to\nachieve through violence\nagainst a nuclear-armed\nnation. The cost is total\nand utter destruction.\nSome people would\nconsiderdeterrencesimply\nto be assured simply from\nthese consequences alone.\nHowever, this is not the\ncase at all. Not only is it\nnecessary to consider the\nconsequences, but it is\nalso necessary to consider\nthe likelihood of these\nconsequences. In the\nMAD doctrine, the only\nway to prevent a nuclear\nretaliation is through a\nfirst strike, where a nation\ndestroys the opposition\u2019s\nwarheads prior to them\nbeing launched. However,\nnation states prevent this\nby concealing the location\nof their warheads. China\nhides its nuclear weapons\nAt least their soul was saved? // Wikimedia\n\u201cCriminal acts\nof passion are\nimpossible to\nprevent via\ndeterrence\u201d\nin forests, the UK hides\nthem in submarines, and\nPakistan hides them in\nvery dodgy and constantly\nmoving vans. Therefore,\na devastating retaliation\nis impossible to prevent,\nhence the lack of a win\ncondition. This works\nwell with states since the\nactors, governments, are\ngenerally rational. No\nstate has consciously used\nnuclear weapons against\nanother similarly armed.\nFrom the above, the\nlack of a win condition\nis a combination of two\nfactors: an appropriate\nconsequence that deters\naction and the certainty\nthat this consequence is\nguaranteed. These two\nfactors create deterrence,\npreventing rational actors\ntaking actions that would\nbe guaranteed to hurt\nthem at an unacceptable\ncost. If we apply this back\nto the idea of the individual committing a crime,\nit is clear that this type\nof deterrence only works\nwhen the actor considers\nthe consequences of their\nactions and the impact\nthat it will have on them.\nHence, criminal acts of\npassion are impossible to\nprevent via deterrence.\nWhen considering the\ndeterrence of rational\ncrimes two factors must\nbe considered: how terrifying the punishment is,\nor the consequence, and\nthe likelihood of being\ncaught, or the probability\nthat this consequence\noccurs. The terrifying\npunishment may be\nterrifying, but as long as\nthere is a chance that the\nindividual is successful\ni.e. is not caught, they\nmay be willing to take\nthe risk, particularly if the\nincentive is large enough.\nTherefore, the potential\ncriminal has a win\ncondition and therefore\nthey may take the chance\nand commit the crime.\nDeterrence has not been\neffective. In order to make\nthe deterrent more effec-tive, it is necessary to do\none of two things: make\n\n"

    "content": "The Power: A Novel with Powerful Ideas that Fails to\nExecute Them\nThe Power is a book with enormous potential, but it fails to effectively capitalise on them with any nuance - and\ninstead hammers home a staler, less original IDEA\nBOOKS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\nfeel quite torn about\nThe Power.\nOn the one hand, I\nthink the frank - even\nbrutal - portrayal of the\nconsequences of physical\npower is to be admired.\nThere\u2019s something to be\nsaid for the fearless bleakness required to write\nthose scenes; scenes of\nrape, abuse, torture, on the\nindividual and systemic\nlevel. The book doesn\u2019t\nshy away from the horror\nof the situations it is pre-senting. It also provides\na somewhat refreshing\nview of power dynamics,\nmoving away from certain\nmodern popular views\nthat tend to boil down to\n\u201cmen bad, women good\u201d.\nOn the other, that refreshing viewpoint is also\nthe source of the novel\u2019s\nweaknesses. Simply put,\nthe concept was not as\nfully explored as I would\nhave liked.\nYes, some of the\ninsights into the way that\nphysical power propagates\ninto social power and the\noppression of the powerless were quite insightful.\nThe acknowledgement\nthat being powerless can,\nin controlled situations,\nbe an attractive or enticing\nthing (especially for those\npreviously used to power)\nwas one I didn\u2019t expect to\nfind. How many authors\ndare to write about men\nenjoying being submissive in bed, for fear of\ndrawing ire from the\ndepressingly fragile egos\nof the Chads of the world?\nAnd yes, it successfully\ncommunicates the old\nadage \u201cpower corrupts,\nand absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely.\u201d But I\nalso feel that it fails to go\nany further, which is what\nI was expecting given the\nhigh praise friends and\nfamily have heaped upon\nthis book.\nThe essential idea\nof the novel is that our\nworld\u2019s historical abuse of\nwomen is a product of the\nphysical power men tend\nto have, which results in\nsocial power, and not a\nproduct of something like\nbiological differences in\nthe brain, such as levels\nof testosterone. In other\nwords, it does not matter\nwhich gender is the more\n\u2018powerful\u2019, in the sense\nthat it wouldn\u2019t stop\nabuses of power. When\nwomen suddenly develop\n\u2018skeins\u2019 which allow them\n\u201cIt could have\nbeen explored\ndeftly,\nfocussing on\ndifferences\nrather than\nsimilarities to\nour world\u201d\nto discharge electricity\nsevere enough to main or\nkill, world history and the\npatriarchy is upended.\nThe consequences of\nthis shift are speculated\nupon, and conclude that\nwomen having the power\nto rape and pillage, or to\nlaunch nukes in signs of\naggression, or whatever\nelse would result in just\nas horrific a world as our\nreal one - one in which\nmen tend to have that\npower. The idea, then, is\nthat gender is essentially\npurelyaconstructofpower\ndynamics; the stereotypes\nthat are associated with\ngenders are originated\nfrom the difference in\nphysical power between\ngenders; and removing\npower differences results\nin no need for the gender\nconstruct.\nGreat. I can get behind\nall that.\nHowever, I feel like all\nof this could have been\nexplored more deftly, with\nmore thought dedicated to\nthe differences that might\nexist in this new hypothetical world - one in\nwhich women only gained\nphysical power after\nhaving been oppressed for\nmillennia - rather than the\nsimilarities. Because I do\ngenuinely believe there\nwould be differences - not\nbecause women are better\nthan men, but because\nanybody who has been\nsubjugated would be fully\naware of what they were\ndoing by abusing their\npower. That situation is\nblatantly not the same\nas the world we live in,\nwhere the privilege of men\nis there because they have\nalways had the advantage\nof that physical power.\nThere are multiple\nways this could play out.\nThe urge for revenge\ncould drive greater\natrocities. The oppressed\ncould empathise and rise\nabove those desires. Any\nnumber of other interesting possibilities present\nthemselves. However, The\nPower, in seeking to make\nits point about genders as\na social construct, wastes\nthis chance. It deliberately\nportrays a world virtually\nidentical to our own, just\nwith the genders reversed;\nthe end of the novel\nfeatures an \u2018epilogue\u2019 of\nsorts, thousands of years\nlater, where a male writer\nis advised to use a female\npen-name instead.\nAs a result, the novel\nvery much starts to read as\n\u201chey you know how men\ndo this to women in our\nworld? well women would\nalso do that to men in this\nworld! Power corrupts,\nguys!\u201d I understand that,\nto an extent, that is the\npoint being made by the\nnovel - but I think, then,\nthat the point should have\nbeen changed, or rather\ndeveloped further. Indeed,\nit starts to feel a little\n\u2018Animal Farm\u2019 in how\n\u2018on the nose\u2019 it is. Animal\nFarm is great, don\u2019t get\nme wrong, but there\u2019s a\nreason it\u2019s not considered\na masterpiece quite on\nthe level of 1984. The\nPower ends up being just\ninteresting, at many points\nbrutal and raw in a way\nthat deserves commendation and respect, and with\nthe potential be a powerful\nnovel for disabusing the\nun- or mis-informed about\nthe nature of power as\nit relates to gender. I\u2019ve\nfound myself using it as an\nexample in conversation,\nin an attempt to illustrate\ncertain points, and that\nspeaks for itself.\nHowever, it sacrifices\nsubtlety and nuance in\norder to ring those particular notes as strongly\nas it does, pounding the\nmessage in with a mallet,\nand in doing so can\ncome across - despite the\ndarkness of some of its\ncontents - almost naive in\nits interpretation. It will\nnot change the landscape\nof political or social commentary for any informed\nreader, as I feel it had the\npotential to do.\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 17TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12\n\n"

Returning to\nMAD, nuclear disarmament campaigners take\naction against nuclear\nweapons because they\nfeel they are an immoral\nsolution to the problem\nof inter-state violence.\nGovernments are more\nable to ignore this issue\nbecause whether a nation\nhas nuclear weapons does\nnot undermine its overall\nlegitimacy in the eyes of\nthe people. At least, not at\nthe moment.\nHowever, it is a different matter entirely when\nit comes to justice. A\ngovernment\u2019s legitimacy\nin the eyes of the people\nit governs is hugely\nimpacted by its ability\nto deliver justice to the\npopulation that it is gov-erning. If a government is\nable to deliver fair and appropriate justice as judged\nby its people, it is a legitimate government. If not,\nthen it becomes less of a\nlegitimate government\nand rules by repression.\nIn democracies where\nthe people are somewhat\nimportant in determining\nwho is to govern, acceptable punishments are a\nnecessity. At present these\nacceptable punishments in\nbeing left to suffocate to\ndeath. If you were particularly fortunate you would\nbe mercifully garrotted or\nhave your throat slashed.\nThis form of punishment is high risk for the\ngovernment executing\nan individual.. Firstly,\nthere is the chance that\nthe person that is being\nexecuted in this manner\nis innocent. To execute\na guilty man this way\ncould be acceptable, but\nto execute an innocent\nman this way would be a\nhorrific and irrevocable\ninjustice. This would\nimpact the legitimacy of\nthe regime dispensing\nthis justice. Additionally,\nthere is the possibility that\nthe punishment does not\nmatch the crime. Breaking\non the wheel was a punishment for highwaymen\nand robbers. This may\nhave seemed appropriate\nat the time. However,\napplying this punishment\nto a starving thief aiming\nto support a large starving\nfamily may have been\nviewed differently by the\nmobs watching. It may\nhave led to deterrence, but\nthe fact that justice was\nseen to be misapplied by\nthe mob would undermine\nthe government\u2019s legiti-macy. These two issues,\nthe potential for innocent\nvictims and ensuring that\nthe punishment fits the\ncrime, make extreme punishment a less attractive\noption for governments\naiming to deter crime,\ndespite the possibility that\nit may be effective.\nThere is also the\nrisk-underestimation\nfactor of the potential\ncriminal that plagues the\nworld due to the prevalence of people failing\nto consider negative\noptions. In this case the\nprospect of a terrifying\npunishment has not been\neffective as a result of the\nsmall likelihood that they\nwould not get away with\nit. As a current gambling\nad says, \u201cwhen there\u2019s a\nchance, there\u2019s always\na chance.\u201d The number\nof people that play the\nlottery further confirms\nthis situation. There is a\nlarge possibility that the\ngovernment will have to\npunish a large number of\npeople extremely, simply\nbecause each thought they\nwould never be caught.\nThis problem of over-pun-ishment can be seen particularly in the US, where\nfixed term sentences have\nbeen applied to people\ncommitting minor crimes\nsuch as the possession of\nweed. Whether this was\nactually a disadvantage\nfor the government that\nbrought it in (Republican)\nis another matter, but\nclearly deterrence through\nharsh punishment failed\nin this situation. It has\nalso undermined the legitimacy of the US regime in\nthe eyes of a significant\nportion of the US popula-when they were being\nobserved. Therefore, the\nonly way for the prisoners\nto rationally avoid punishment was to behave well\nall the time. I believe that\nthe same logic has been\napplied by many mod-ern-day governments that\nuse far-reaching and intrusive mass surveillance\ntechniques in order to\nmaintain an increased grip\non society without having\nto resort to more extreme\nor inhumane forms of\npunishment. The Edward\nSnowden leaks provide\nconclusive evidence of\nthis in the Western world.\nOther governments, such\nas Russia and China, are\nalso relying increasingly\non surveillance to more\neffectively control their\npopulations.\nSurveillance has\nfurther advantages. When\ncoupled with a large\nnumber of police and\nother state actors, it can\nbe used to prevent and\npredict crimes of passion.\nThis raises the further\nquestion: is the cost to our\nindividual privacy worth\nthe safety we think that it\nprovides?\n\u201cAcceptable\npunishments\nin the UK\nare prison\nsentences and\nfines\u201d\nthe UK are prison sentences of a given length, fines,\nor community service. In\nthe past, punishments that\nwould have been acceptable include something\ncalled \u201cbreaking on the\nwheel\u201d. To be broken on\nthe wheel was to have all\nyour limbs broken and\nthen braided through the\nspokes of a wheel before\n\u201cLevels of\ngovernment\nsurveillance\nare increasing\nworldwide\u201d\ntion.\nIn the late 1700s, the\nutilitarian philosopher\nJeremy Bentham came up\nwith a novel concept for\na new modern prison to\nforce the good behaviour\nof its inmates: the pano-pticon. The panopticon\nconsisted of a system\nof cells where each of\nthe inmates could be\nobserved at any time by\nthe prison warden and\ncrucially would not know\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

As the\nsingle biggest modifiable\naspect of an individual\u2019s\nhealth, diet has become\na major focus for disease\nprevention, with research\nshowing that up to 40% of\ncancers can be prevented\nby minor nutrition and\nlifestyle alterations.\nRecent advances in\nartificial intelligence technologies and the growth of\ndatabases on food, drugs\nand diseases have made it\npossible to identify molecules within food that can\nprevent or combat diseases and their symptoms. A\nset of such molecules has\nalready been discovered\nby examining structural\nsimilarities between food\nmolecules and existing\ntherapeutics. A team\nof Imperial College\nLondon researchers\nhave further developed a\nnovel machine-learning\nstrategy to predict can-cer-beating molecules,\nwhich influence the same\ncellular processes targeted\nby current clinical ther-apies. These molecules\nregulate cell growth and\ninflammation, therefore\nsuppressing cancer cell\nsurvival, proliferation\nand spread. The Imperial\nscientists analysed 7962\nfood molecules to discover nearly 110 potential\ncandidates for the fight\nagainst cancer which are\npredominantly found in\nplant-based foods, such\nas tea, carrots, celery,\norange, grape, coriander,\ncabbage and dill. Their\nmachine-learning strategy\nis not limited to cancer\nresearch but can also be\nused to pinpoint general\nhealth-promoting food\nmolecules or those applicable to other diseases.\nThe ultimate goal of\nsuch research is to generate a database of food\ningredients, rich in dis-ease-fighting molecules,\nthat can later be used to\ndesign \u201chyperfoods\u201d.\nHyperfoods are envisaged\nto have health-promoting\nor therapeutic effects, to\nimprove disease treatment\noutcomes and decrease\nthe overall healthcare\nburden. They are a mul-ti-disciplinary endeavour,\nrequiring not only\nscientific and technological expertise, but culinary\noptimisation (improving\naesthetic features, such\nas colour, shape, and\ntexture, and sensory char-acteristics, such as taste,\nsmell, mouthfeel) and\nlarge-scale industrial pro-duction. Indeed, in 2018\nan international group of\nacademics, chefs and local\nfood producers signed a\nManifesto on the Future of\nComputing & Food with\nthe aim to revolutionise\nthe production, distribu-tion, and consumption\nof food. The manifesto\npledges to educate people\nabout the impact of their\ndiet on their health and\nwellbeing, to enable da-ta-driven informed food\npolicy decision making\nand to ensure transparency\non the origin and heritage\nof food.\nHyperfoods are thus\npaving the future to\ngastronomic medicine,\nan unusual kind of\npersonalised medicine\nwith \u201cfood passports\u201d\nthat provide tailored and\ntherapeutically functional\nfoods for each individual.\nCurrently, there are some\nobvious limitations to this\npreventative approach. It\nis unclear whether any of\nthe identified molecules\nare present in sufficient\nconcentrations within\nfood items to perform\ntheir proposed health-pro-moting functions. It also\nremains to be established\nwhether the molecules\ncan retain their biologically beneficial properties\nthrough the process of\ncultivation, preparation,\ncooking and storage. So,\ndespite structurally resembling drugs or acting\non the same cellular\nprocesses as current ther-apies, the health effects of\nthe predicted hyperfoods\nare yet to be validated and\nquantified.\nIn that sense, hyper-foods are quite similar\nto the widely popular su-perfoods. Superfoods\nare marketed as nutrient\ndense and beneficial\nto our health - they are\nsupposed to be full of\nantioxidants to fight off\ncancer, healthy fats to\nprevent heart disease, and\nfibre to keep the digestive\nsystem in check. Popular\nsuperfoods include\nblueberries, kale, pome-granates, goji berries and\nchia seeds among others.\nThere are, however, no set\ncriteria for determining\nwhat makes food \u201csuper\u201d\nand there is no scientific\nsupport for the superior\nhealth-promoting effects\nof superfoods.\nPomegranates, for\ninstance, are suggested\nto reduce arterial damage\ncaused by cholesterol and\ndecrease the progress of\nprostate tumours, but the\nevidence behind these\nclaims is either inconclusive or incomplete.\nSimilarly, goji berries\nhave been used in traditional Chinese medicine\nfor thousands of years,\nboasting cancer curing\nand preventative abilities.\nFine tuning of consciousness // Ivu.org, Thigala shri\nis chia seeds. They are\nhighly rich in omega-3\nfats, which are a staple\nof the notoriously healthy\nMediterranean diet.\nHowever, the omega-3s\nin chia seeds are disparate\nfrom the health-promoting\nomega-3s in fish, and our\nbodies are very inefficient\nin processing the former\ninto the latter. While fish\nis widely accepted to protect against heart diseases,\nchia seeds have shown no\nsignificant effects with\nthe regards to risk from\ncardiovascular disorders.\nBombarded with su-perfoods in supermarket\naisles and wellness trends\non social media, we are\nmore health conscious\ntoday than ever before.\nBut the high pace of\neveryday life is not always\ncompatible with a healthy\nlifestyle \u2013 homecooked\n5-a-day meals and regular\nexercise. So, naturally, we\nseek little cheats such as\nsuperfoods - obviously it\nis comforting to believe\nthat eating a kale salad for\nlunch or drinking charcoal\nshots for breakfast can\nhelp us avoid the horrors\nof being chronically or\nterminally ill. But, it is\nonly a small leap from\nsuperfoods to hyperfoods.\nAs scientists are trying to\nidentify and extract the\nbest health-promoting\nmolecules from all food in\norder to create a hyperfood\nmeal that can alleviate our\nhealth concerns, it appears\nthat wellness and medicine might finally meet.\n\u201cHyperfoods\nare paving\nthe future to\ngastronomic\nmedicine\u201d\nFrom Superfoods to Hyperfoods\nHowever, clinical studies\nhave failed to validate\nthe healing properties of\ngoji berries, and in terms\nof nutrients, goji berries\ndo not outperform other\nberries or fruit. Another\ncase of misleadingly\nadvertised superfoods\n\n"
