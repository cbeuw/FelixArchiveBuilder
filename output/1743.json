The\nGardeners have managed\nto rip themselves away\nfrom city life and currently manage to thrive with\nminimal disruption from\nthe outside world. All\nis well until a colourful\nmeteorite falls outside the\nGardener residence and\nchanges the fabric of reality around the family and\ntheir home. Based on the\nbook of the same name\nby H. P. Lovecraft, writer\nof well renowned short\nstories such as The call\nof Chuthulu, I can\u2019t help\nbut believe this movie adaptation diverges slightly\nfrom what it means to be\nLovecraftian.\nOne of the pleasures\nof seeing this film on the\nbig screen is the chance to\nenjoy the natural beauty\nof the secluded forest the\nGardners live in. This is\nmirrored perfectly in the\nidyllic family dynamic\nthat is witnessed as a\ndefinite calm before the\nstorm. Once the meteorite\nlands, we are able to sense\na slowly building change\nthat affects everything\nfrom the water to the\nbehaviors of people and\nanimals alike. The already\ngorgeous beauty of the\nlocation is enhanced as\nif touched up by some\nethereal paintbrush and\ndespite the increasingly\nstrange behaviour of the\nfamily in reaction to the\ncrash, it is the changes to\nnature that I found myself\nwanting more of. This\nends up being my mistake.\nWe soon learn that there is\nno bigger picture to look\nforward to and before\nlong the film becomes\nan overwhelming and\nhorrific assault on all the\nsenses. Think self-mutila-tion, cancerous mutations\nand radiation burn. Later\nlearning that some of the\nmost awful parts of this\nfilm were not necessarily\na part of the original story\nwas incredibly frustrating.\nThis is especially due to\nthe interests of the film\nstudio Spectrevision\nhaving spent nine years\nsearching for a true to the\nstory take on the novella.\nWriter and director\na larger audience with a\ngreater cultural impact.\nMuch of what I feel is\nlacking from Color out\nof Space I believe can\nbe found successfully\nexecuted in 2018\u2019s Annihilation, which is itself\nloosely based on the same\nLovecraft short story.\nSome of the challenges\nfaced by the writers of\nthis adaptation is bringing\nthe story to the 21st\ncentury and padding out\nwhat is essentially a fifty\nsix page story to make a\nfeature length film. One\nof the choices made by the\nwriting team was to make\nMrs. Gardner a survivor\nof breast cancer, a fascinating decision bearing in\nmind that one of the core\nthemes of Annihilation\nis also cancer and how it\ncreates an unfavourable\nalternative reality for\nthose affected by it.\nActing as a remedy to\nso much horror were some\nremarkable performances\nby the cast. In particular\nGardner\u2019s daughter,\nLavinia (Madeleine\nArthur), who manages to\nplay the role of an angsty\nteen mentally battling the\never-changing unravelling\nof her reality powerfully,\ntaking nightmarish scenes\nand, at times, baffling\ndialogue in her stride.\nNicholas Cage also does\nnot disappoint as the\npatriarch, a somewhat\nobsessive novice farmer\nand avid drinker of alpaca\nmilk. One of the more disappointing performances\ncomes from the unnamed\nvisiting hydrologist\n(Elliot Knight), our sto-ryteller, whose sole role\nof reacting to the Gardner\nfamily ordeal is dwarfed\nby the intensity of the rest\nof the cast.\nFor me, the audience\nreaction helped to highlight the more lighthearted\nmoments of this movie.\nThe ridiculousness of\nMr. Gardner\u2019s perpetual\nconcern for his alpacas,\nfor example. The sad\nirony of this audience\nreaction is the deep\nbelly laughter to scenes\nthat were intended to be\nsincere moments of grief\nor fear. Especially seeing\nas producer Daniel Noah\nreleased in a statement\nthat to his dismay many\nadaptations of Lovecraft\nseem to lack sincerity by\ntaking the comedic route,\nclaiming that \u201cthere was\nnothing funny about\nLovecraft\u2019\u2019.\nAs a reward for\nsitting through what I\ncan promise feels like\nan eternity of horror,\nwe are gifted with thirty\nminutes of unnecessary,\nunintelligible chaos which\nmanages to end satisfy-ingly. Color out of Space\nmanages to bring to life a\nshort story from the early\n20th century with notable\nqualities, including the\nthoughtful use of colour\nand design throughout.\nOn reflection after the film\nand after asking myself if\nall the choices made in\nthe film were necessary, I\nfelt torn. How else would\na film be able to convince\nme of the unimaginable\nalternative reality that\nFILM\nDir:RichardStanley.Script:\nRichard Stanley, Scarlett\nAmaris Starring: Nicolas\nCage, Joely Richardson. 111\nminutes, 2020\nCOLOR OUT OF SPACE\nJasmin Daley\nFilm Writer\nNathan Gardener (Nicolas Cage) basking in the purple hues of a fallen meteorite // RLJE Films\n\u201cOne of the\npleasures of\nseeing this\nfilm on the\nbig screen is\nthe chance\nto enjoy the\nnatural beauty\nof the forest\nscenery used\u201d\n\u201cA remedy\nto so much\nhorror was an\nensemble of\nremarkable\nperformances\nfrom some of\nthe cast\u201d\nRichard Stanley treads a\nfine line between making\nthis one hundred year old\nstory relevant and losing\nthe essence of what it\nmeans to be Lovecraftian,\nwhich is less graphic\ngore but the more subtle\nyet overwhelming fear\nof the unknown and the\nfragility and meekness\nof humans in relation to\nthe vast cosmos.

Everywhere\nyou look, executives are\naching to talk about how\nthey\u2019re trying their very\nutmost to increase the diversity of their workforce\nand maximise inclusivity.\nGlibness aside, if you\nvalue equality of opportu-nity, both of these things\nare highly important.\nDifferent groups have\ndifferent disadvantages,\noften as a result of historical or institutional factors\nthat negatively impact the\nindividuals that make up\nthese groups. The concept of intersectionality,\nthat individuals can be a\npart of different groups\nthat are advantaged and\ndisadvantaged in different\nways neatly encompasses\nthat concept. If Imperial is\nto be meritocratic, it really\nneeds to handle the different challenges that each\nindividual experiences\nas part of the different\ncommunities studying\nhere. As a gay white man\nwith white heteronorma-tive middle-class parents\nstudying physics, I am\ndefinitely not equipped to\ndiscuss the experiences\nof all minority groups.\nNevertheless, I still feel\nthe need to discuss the\ndiversity and inclusivity\nwithin an institution that,\nperhaps fittingly, names\nitself \u201cImperial\u201d College\nLondon.\nLast week I was at an\nImperial LGBT+ careers\nfair. Stephen Curry the\nAssistant Provost for\nEquality, Diversity and\nInclusion (a white man)\npraised the University\nfor climbing around\n100 places in the 2020\ntook part in the Index.\nAlthough climbing 100\nplaces is an impressive\nachievement, there is\nclearly still much that\nneeds to be done, particularly in the Physics depart-ment. In the Department,\nvery few undergraduates\nare female. There are only\na handful of black un-dergraduates, in a cohort\nof almost a thousand.\nOf those, even fewer are\nblack and female, and this\nis not to mention other\nintersections.\nOne could argue that\nit is not necessarily the\nfault of a University like\nImperial College London\nthat a cohort of students\nand staff is not diverse,\nmaybe more the fault\nof society as a whole.\nAlthough not diverse,\nperhaps Imperial is inclu-sive? Unfortunately, for a\nwhole range of minority\ngroups the Physics department is failing.\nThe Physics LGBT+\nNetwork ran a survey last\nmonth to gauge the inclu-sivity of the toilet/shower\nfacilities in Blackett Laboratory. There were 216\nresponses from Physics\nstaff and students. From\nthose, 43% would benefit\nfrom gender neutral toilet\nfacilities. Moreover, of the\nrespondents 24% believe\nthat the current facilities\nare not inclusive. I am\nof the opinion that 24%\nis a somewhat worrying\nfigure. Currently there\nare only male, female,\nand two accessible toilets,\nwith both accessible\ntoilets on the 9th floor.\nDo the other 76% of\nrespondents believe there\nto be only two genders?\nOr do they believe it is\nacceptable for someone to\nhave to travel many floors\neach time they want to use\na toilet during the day?\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t ask\nSimone\u2019s opinion on that\none.\nIn the same survey, 28%\nof respondents believed\nthat they would benefit\nfrom baby changing facilities in the Department.\nCurrently there are no\nbaby changing facilities\navailable. Balancing\nchildcare with academia\nis already a seemingly\nimpossible task, so why\nmake it harder?\nImperial also struggles\nto manage the needs of\nthe trans community.\nAlthough Imperial has a\ntrans staff policy they lack\na trans student policy,\nmaking it incredibly\nchallenging for staff and\nthe college to deal with a\nstudent that is transition-ing. Naturally, this will\nhave a detrimental effect\non the student, making a\ndifficult time even more\ndifficult.\nIn a survey run by\nFelix in March 2018, 40%\nof 300 respondents had\nexperienced misogyny\nat Imperial, and over\n70% had experienced\npeers making derogatory\ncomments about women.\nA workshop hosted by\nthe Director of Development for UN Women\nUK last term triggered\nthe conversation around\nmisogyny amongst\nstudents in the Physics\nDepartment. There was\ntalk of an undergraduate\nwoman being told by\nan academic that as a\nwoman she would not be\nrecognised unless she had\na PhD. There was talk of\na laboratory technician\ntalking over a female\nstudent to another male\nstudent, despite her asking\nfor help first. Things don\u2019t\nseem to have changed\ndrastically since March\n2018.\nIf you have recently\nwalked through the\nPhysics Department you\nmay have noticed the\nrainbow \u201cally\u201d stickers\non some office doors. The\nidea behind the scheme\nis that volunteering\nstaff members received\nbespoke LGBT+ ally\ntraining and are then given\nthe stickers. A great idea,\nit would seem. Until you\nfind out that only 3 of the\n9 allies actually attended\nthe training session.\nOther staff, have managed\nto simply acquire the\nstickers. A great idea for\npinkwashing. One might\nbegin to think maybe the\nPhysics Department aren\u2019t\ndoing all they could to be\ncompletely inclusive.\nI\u2019ll leave you with this.\nJust before entering the\nmain lecture theatre in\nthe Physics Department,\nyou will be greeted by a\ndisplay featuring pictures\nof past Heads of Department, the vast majority\nof which are white men.\nWhen attending lectures,\nyou will be greeted by\namazing lecturers, the\nvast majority of which are\nwhite men. When attending tutorials, you will be\nhelped by great tutors, the\nvast majority of which are\nwhite men. You probably\nget the idea. Although we\ncan\u2019t change the past, we\ncan definitely shape the\nfuture. That is up to us.\nDiversity flags.

They are\nclothes that are trendy\ntoday, and out of mode by\ntomorrow. The clothes are\nsold cheaply and in large\nquantities to maximise\nrevenue. Those garments\nmove from the runway to\nstores at incredible speed,\nbut they end up in the\ntrash even faster.\nMillions of customers\nparticipate in this mindless\nconsumption of fashion,\nand it has led to huge environmental detriments. It\nis estimated that 12 billion\ntonnes of reusable textiles\ngo to landfills every year,\nand this makes up 30% of\nall total waste.\nThe fast fashion\nindustry emits 1.2 billion\ntons of CO2 equivalent\nper year, which is about\n5% of total global emis-sions. To put this into\nperspective, this sky-high\ncarbon footprint is more\nthan the emissions created\nby air travel and international shipping.\nFurthermore, fast\nfashion is a huge threat\nto water resources. This\nis largely due to how\nwater intensive cotton\nplants are. It takes about\n2,000 gallons of water to\nproduce a pair of jeans\n(more than enough for\none person to drink for 10\nyears) and it takes about\n700 gallons of water to\nproduce one cotton shirt\n(enough for one person\nto drink for over three\nyears).\nOverall, the fashion\nindustry is responsible for\n20% of all industrial water\npollution worldwide.\nProduction of textiles\nis said to use over three\nthousand types of chemi-cals, and textile dyeing is\nthe world\u2019s second-largest\npolluter of water, as water\nfrom the dyeing process is\ndumped into rivers.\nMost fast fashion\nclothing is made from pol-yester, which releases two\nto three times more carbon\nemissions than cotton\nduring production and\ndoes not biodegrade. It is\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMost fast fasion is fast to get dumped in landfills // JBER\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFELIX ISSUE 1743\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cThe fast\nfashion\nindustry emits\n1.2 billion\ntons of CO2\nequivalent per\nyear, which is\nabout 5% of\ntotal global\nemissions.\u201d\nXiuchen Xu\nSustainability Editor\nestimated that washing\nfast fashion pieces made\nfrom polyester releases\n500,000 tons of microfib-ers into the ocean each\nyear, which is the equivalent of 50 billion plastic\nbottles.\nThere is also another\nhorrificpracticeofburning\nunsold clothes (not limited\nto fast fashion, as brands\nlike Louis Vuitton and\nBurberry also participate\nin this). This happens\nbecause of the fast\nfashion cycles, with many\nclothes unfashionable\nvery quickly, and with no\ndemand. The brands also\ndon\u2019t donate the clothes,\nas they are worried of donations devaluating their\nbrand.\nMoreover, fast fashion\nbrands often attempt\ngreenwashing and pretend\nthat their products are\nmore environmentally\nfriendly than they really\nare. They are vague about\ntheir environmental and\nsocial commitments and\nlaunch sustainability\ncampaigns that are totally\ndevoid of transparency.\nThat doesn\u2019t however\nstop them from claiming\nthat their products are\n\u201cethical\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d.\nThe horrific consequences of fast fashion\nextend beyond the environmental damages, there\nis also a huge amount of\nexploitation of workers in\norder to produce clothing\nso cheap. Garment factory\nworkers\u2019 wage starts\nincredibly low at just \u00a325\na month, and they work 14\nhours a day. The workers\nare mostly women, and\nmany have reported\nphysical and verbal abuse\nat work. There is also no\nstandard for health and\nsafety; fast fashion factories lack ventilation, and\nworkers will breath in\ntoxic substances and fibre\ndust in unsafe buildings.\nIn the infamous 2013\nDhaka garment factory\ncollapse, over a thousand\nworkers were killed in\na factory that supplied\nfor the likes of Primark,\nMonsoon, Prada, Gucci\nand more. Worker\u2019s\nunions are also prohibited\nwhich stops meaningful\nchanges from happening.\nInvestigations have also\nfound that H&M has used\nchild labour in factories in\nMyanmar.\nAs consumers, we\ncan combat fast fashion,\nmostly by boycotting\ntheir products and not\nspending our money on\ntheir products. There is a\nsaying that one votes with\ntheir money, and by not\nspending money on fast\nfashion, we can help stop\nthe consequences. A great\nthing to do would be to\nstart thrift shopping; you\ncan find many amazing\nclothes for good prices\nin vintage shops, and\nmany true fashionistas\nshop this way. When\nyou have a clothing you\nno longer need, you can\nalways donate it, or even\nrepurpose it, as fabrics\ncan have multiple uses.\nAnother important thing\nis to have conversations\nand raise awareness on\nthe consequences of fast\nfashion. The only reason\nthose brands thrive is\nbecause of the lack of\ntransparency and lack of\nknowledge of consumers\non the true horrific nature\nof the industry, which is\nhidden with bright and\ncheerful advertisements.\nThe more people become\nconscious of their con-sumerism, the less power\nthose brands will have.\nFast fashion uses cotton which is a hugely water intensive plant // Flickr\n\n"

A week of feverish\ncampaigning will follow,\nbefore voting opens between the 9th and 12th of\nMarch. Events like Meet\nthe Candidates \u2013 a live-streamed debate between\ncontenders for major\nroles \u2013 will help students\nmake those tough choices\nwhere manifestos fail to\nconvince.\nThe Imperial elections\nhave, by and large, been\nsuccessful events every\nyear. While criticism can\nbe levied \u2013 see this week\u2019s\nComment section \u2013 there\nis no denying that the\nUnion does excel at this\ntask at this time every\nsingle year.\nMany roles are hotly\ncontested, and the elections drama gives the\nentire university community a welcome distraction\nfrom the looming dread\nof exams just around the\ncorner.\nSo, there\u2019s plenty of\nsupport and plenty of\ncoverage for the candidates that do run. You can\nmake your own choice\nfor who the best of those\nis. What you can\u2019t do,\nof course, is vote for\nsomeone that didn\u2019t run.\nThe question that naturally arises for me is: well,\nhow do I know the best\ncandidate actually ran?\nWhen do I vote for good\nol\u2019 Ronald? Or, as he\u2019s\nmore commonly known,\nRON \u2013 or to Reopen\nNominations.\nI\u2019m not convinced that\na lot of the best candidates\nactually end up running.\nYou can, of course, argue\nthat the best candidates\nare the ones who want\nto be there, and anybody\nelse would inherently be a\nwaste of time. But I think,\ntaking my premise as true,\nthat we should be asking\nourselves why the best\ncandidates don\u2019t want to\nbe there.\nThe optimal people\nto bring into each role\nwould be experienced\nUnion volunteers. They\nare the people who have\nthe most insight, the\nmost experience, the\nmost inside knowledge,\nthe most connections and\nrelationships within the\nUnion and College com-munity. They\u2019re the ones\nwho actually know how\nthings work, and can hit\nthe ground sprinting when\nthey start their roles.\nA lot of those senior\nvolunteers do run. I expect\nthis year\u2019s nominations to\ninclude a range of people\nwith a boatload of expe-rience. It\u2019s the wayward\nchildren, so to speak, that\nwe need to focus on \u2013 the\nboatloads of experience\nthat leave, vanish, flushed\ndown the drain and lost to\nthe community forever.\nThose that do not run\nfor Sab roles at the end\nof their degrees, or who\ndon\u2019t run for Faculty Rep\nafter succeeding as Dep\nRep, and so on, despite\nbeing extremely highly\nqualified.\nI do think a lot of these\npeople don\u2019t run for good\nreasons. Some have no\ninterest in postponing\ntheir careers, for example.\nWe are a highly career-fo-cused university, so this\nis understandable. More\npower to them.\nSo what worries me,\nreally, is the selection\nof people who don\u2019t run\nbecause they\u2019re sick to\nthe back teeth of\u2026 well,\neverything. There are a\nboatload of them, too. I\u2019ve\nspoken to a bunch of them\nthis year, investigating\nvarious stories, and it\u2019s\na growing litany. They\nare the people who\u2019ve\nbeen in the Union system\nsince their very first term,\nwho\u2019ve fought through\nissues like staff vacancies,\ndelayed contracts, impossible room bookings,\nbureaucracy, whatever it\nmight be.\nWhat any of them end\nup feeling is not invigorated and motivated. They\nend up tired, and turning\ntheir back on the institution that should be doing\neverything it can to retain\nthem. They\u2019ve often been\nused up before they got to\na place where they could\ninstigate real, drastic\nchanges.\nThis isn\u2019t universal \u2013\nmy intention is really not\nto cast shade on those\nrunning this year, or in\nprevious years. Plenty of\nthem were the best can-didates. It\u2019s just that there\nare undoubtedly good\npeople we lose every year\nto fatigue and frustration,\nrather than for any acceptable reason.\nI think this should\nbe the Union\u2019s greatest\nfocus \u2013 it grows stronger\nby building a strong,\nlong-lasting community\nof volunteers who want\nto stick around, become\nSabs, join as staff\nmembers, and so on. To do\nso should not be an ordeal,\nbut rather a genuinely\ncoveted and competitive\nopportunity.\nThis is more important\nthan the election facts and\nfigures. Having someone\nin a role is superseded by\nhaving the right person in\nthe role. While they are\nimpressive, the Union\nneeds to square this great\nstrength with one of its\ngreatest weaknesses \u2013\nretention, of staff and especially of dedicated and\nknowledgeable students.\nOnce they\u2019ve achieved\nthat, their upwards\nmomentum will rocket.\n2\n\n"

In the last\ntwelve months, Felix\nhas, to mention just a\nfew, reported on: The\nUnion\u2019s worsening\nfinancial position,\ndwindling sales at the\nbars, the closure of the\nkitchens due to health\nand safety concerns,\nthe resignation of the\nmanaging director,\nthe resignation of a\nstaggering percentage\nof staff, and repeated\nfailures to support CSPs\nand CUs properly. My\npersonal opinion is that\nthe organisation is rud-derless, without a clear\ndirection, and failing in\nits key function \u2013 acting\nas a Union for its mem-bers. Now, before I go\nany further, I would like\nto point out that I think\nwe hit rock bottom a\nwhile ago and that the\nfuture of the Union, with\nproper leadership, looks\nbrighter.\nWhen people\ncomment on the failings\nof the Union they will\ngenerally be met with\nthe same retort. This\nwill normally go something along the lines\nof gushing about how\ngood the Union is when\nit comes to elections.\nSpecifically, the spring\nLeadership Elections.\nIf you\u2019ve somehow\nmanaged to miss this\ns e l f - c o n g r a t u l a t o r y\nparade, it happens in\nMarch. Every March.\nIn my four years at the\nuniversity, the record\nhasn\u2019t been changed\nand talking to former\nstudents, it\u2019s been going\non for a long time.\nThe praise goes\nsomewhere along the\nlines of: \u201cunprecedented\nturn out\u201d, \u201cmore roles\nfilled\u201d, \u201cmore roles\u201d.\nIt\u2019s true, the Union does\nregularly achieve one\nof the highest turnouts\nfor university elections,\nand people standing for\nthe majority of its nearly\n800 roles. Now, there\nare arguments to be\nmade about how these\nstatistics have very little\nto do with the actions of\nthe Union and more to\ndo with things like the\nsize of the university,\nthe constituent union\nstructures, the fact\nthat ICU includes CSP\nelections in its turnout\nfigure (not a practice\nthat I could find at any\nother Universities) etc.\nWhether any of these\nthings are true, is not\nsomething that I care\nabout or something that\nmatters. My view on the\nmatter is quite simple.\nThe Union is good at\nelections. Good. Move\non.\nYou see, in my experience as a \u2018senior\nvolunteer\u2019 for the Union\nand in the experience of\nmany others that I have\nspoken to, this time\nof year is increasingly\nfrustrating. Around\nabout now, more and\nmore aspects of the\nUnion cease to function\nas entire teams of staff\u2019s\nattention is turned\ntowards elections.\nMeetings upon meetings\nare held about increasing turnout and improving elections. Access to\nUnion communication\nchannels is all but prohibited because they are\nreserved for elections.\nSignificant sums of\nmoney are spent on advertising and running the\nelections. For a decent\ningly disengaged with\na Union whose goals\nthey aren\u2019t aware of and\nwhose actions go unno-ticed. As the University\ngrows, the voter turnout\nwill likely increase and\nas the Union continues\nto flounder, we are likely\nto see more \u201crecord\nbreaking engagement\u201d\nas people use their vote\nin protest. All of this\nwill justify the Union\u2019s\ndecision to partially stop\nfunctioning for three\nmonths a year and hide\nthe fact that, due to poor\ncommunication, the\nUnion is becoming more\nand more irrelevant with\neach passing year.\nI\u2019m not suggesting\nthat the Union ceases\nto do any work towards\nelections, only that, as\nwhen revising for an\nexam, they review their\nresources and importance that they attach\nto the event. Put it this\nway, if you consistently\ngot 80% in an exam\nmodule year on year and\n50% in another, it would\nbe illogical to commit\nmore of your resources\nto improving the 80% as\nthe law of diminishing\nreturns holds true.\nAs a petty final point,\nit would be nice if the\nUnion held itself to\nthe same standards it\nholds candidates to. The\nnumber of too-close-to-gether posters and the\nnew sticker campaign\nwould definitely have\nme lodging a complaint.\nDon\u2019t forget to\nnominate yourself\nand lead the change at\nImperial. STAND.\nElections really make the Union drop the ball // Wikimedia\nfew months of the year,\nthe Union stops really\nfunctioning properly.\nIn 2016 the National\nUnion of Students\n(NUS) carried out some\nanalysis on student\nunion elections and\nelection turnout. One\nof the key findings of\nthe analysis was that\nthe voter turnout was\ndirectly correlated to the\nnumber of positions and\nthe number of candidates standing for those\npositions. So really, if\nthe Union\u2019s sole aim\nis going to be patting\nthemselves on the back\nfor voter turnout, they\nshould just concentrate\non getting more people\nto stand for election. Ah\nhah they might say, increasing the number of\ncandidates requires the\nresources that the Union\nthrows at elections.\nHowever, in my experience and in talking\nto others, not knowing\nabout roles is not the\nreason for not standing.\nIt\u2019s that, increasingly,\nbeing a volunteer for the\nUnion is a thankless task\nwhere you are likely to\nspend a considerable\nproportion of your year\nbanging your head\nagainst a wall trying to\nsolve issues that would\nbe easy to solve if you\nhad\u2026 adequate staff\nsupport.\nThe situation we\nfind ourselves in seems\nto be a box ticking\nexercise, an easy way\nfor the Union to claim\nthat they are successful\nin reaching out and\ncommunicating with\nstudents. The reality we\nfind ourselves in could\nnot be further from this.\nStudents are increas-COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 14TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\n8\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

By co-incidence, Fra\u2019s sister has\nreappeared in Northern\nIreland for the first time\nin twenty years and,\nunbeknownst to everyone,\nbought that very same\ncommunity hall. What\nfollows is the tightening\ncalculus of family con-flicts, reckonings with a\nwar most would like to\nforget, and a digging at\nsecrets best left buried.\nIndeed, there are\ntreasures worth unburying\nin On McQuillan\u2019s Hill\n(Joseph Crilly): a rich\nHiberno-English patter\ncolours the play \u2013 this\nis dialogue as it should\nbe, balanced on a knife\nedge between laughter\nand violence and ready to\nplunge into either as the\nstrings of relationships\nentwine and slacken. I\nspent a childhood catching\nthe dulcet tones of Doric\nand retained enough to\nenjoy the banter; a crash-course in Ulster Scots\nmight get you more out\nof the production, but\nneither dialect nor accent\nis thick enough to mask\nthe action.\nAnd what action it is.\nCrilly\u2019s ear for dialogue\nis matched by an eye for\ncharacter, all complex, all\nbroken, all believable. The\nmen range from pitiful\nto malicious. Crilly isn\u2019t\nmaking a misanthropic\nargument: rather, he\u2019s\ninvested in dismantling\nmythologies and abstrac-tions, the blushing portrait\nof the freedom fighter, of\nthe cause. War\u2019s always\nbeen a man\u2019s game, and\nif it reflects an innate\nsensibility for violence,\nit also reflects a need for\nego-swelling, for a sense\nof importance. Fra Maline\ncan\u2019t talk to his family\nand drinks enough units\nto put away a horse before\nbreakfast. However, in\nhis eyes he\u2019s an unresting\nfreedom fighter, ready\nto liberate the North at a\nmoment\u2019s notice - never\nmind that he got shot\nin the leg on his first\nmission, or that he\u2019s too\nbusy hiding a gay affair\nto topple an autocratic\nBritish client state. Fra is\nmerely pathetic: another\nvolunteer makes the\npoint of war\u2019s cruelty, its\ncallousness, much more\nstarkly. Of course, this\nisn\u2019t anti-republicanism\nso much as anti-sectari-anism \u2013 anti-murdering\npeople on their way to do\nthe shopping, anti-wiping\nyour hands of your own\ncrimes. It\u2019s the women of\nthe play who must bear\nthe brunt of the pain the\nself-absorption of mythol-ogizing entails, but Crilly\nalso gives them the grace\nto be flawed on their own\nmerits. They are people,\nand against the pettiness\nof the men it is their\ntraumas and desperate\nhopes that linger behind\nthe last bow.\nNow, the play\u2019s not a\ntotal success: in a final act\nthat veers close to melo-drama, the play takes the\npossibility of rural incest\ntoo seriously for its own\ngood (for those who\u2019ve\nmissed the wasteful\nviolence, county Antrim\nscenery and shoelace-knot\nfamily trees of Game of\nThrones, this might be\none to catch). But Crilly\u2019s\nwriting always outpaces\nhis machinations; for\nanyone wanting a look at a\nperiod too often buried in\nmemory, you\u2019ll find some\nrewarding views across\nthe Irish sea on McQuillan\u2019s hill indeed.\nCrilly dismantles the mythologies of freedom fighters\nand the whitewashing of violence // Johnny Vivash\nARTS\nFELIX ISSUE 1743\n11\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nFelix Swift Roberts\nArts Writer\nWhere?

How else can\nyou see yourself, when\nfaced with a woman such\nas Gwyneth Paltrow,\nactress-turned-entre-preneur, who has had\nherself stung by bees\nto maintain a youthful\ncomplexion. Goop, the\ncompany she started as an\nonline newsletter offering\nlifestyle tips to fans,\nhas since expanded to a\nmultimedia conglomerate.\nToday, there is an e-shop,\nan annual conference,\na magazine and, as of\nJanuary 2020, a Netflix\ndocumentary series. In\nthe opening of Goop\nLab, which explores the\nfrontiers of wellness\nculture, Paltrow describes\nher motivation as a desire\nfor more from life than\nmaking out with Matt\nDamon, a top contender\nfor my favourite humble\nbrag of 2020. She finds\nthis higher purpose in the\n\u201coptimisation of the self\u201d\nand an unending drive\ntowards experimentation.\nEach episode typically\nfocuses on Paltrow and a\ngroup of company staffers\nexploring a strand of\nwellness and health, from\nwell-trotted topics like\ndieting and sex to zanier\nones like mediumship and\nenergy channelling. To\nstretch the term beyond\nwhat is healthy at a\nSTEM university, there is\nsomething of a scientific\nmethod to Goop Lab\u2019s\napproach and this forms\nthe structure for each\nepisode. We typically\nbegin with a discussion\nwith one of several\nexperts who are featured\nthroughout the show,\nwhere they outline their\ncredentials, goals, and\nintroduce acclamatory\ntestimonials from people\nthey worked with. These\ntreatments are then tested\nby company employees,\nwho are all beautiful, but\nnot to an extent that is\nunreachable if only you\nworked on yourself more\nor finally purchased some\nGoop products.\nGwyneth Paltrow at one\npoint jokingly calls herself\nthe ultimate Guinea Pig,\nalthough it is usually her\nstaff and the experts who\ntry the more unconventional treatments, whether\nit is drinking psilocybin\ntea or being taught how\nto masturbate while taped.\nAs in \u2018regular\u2019 science,\nmost of the trials are done\nin large groups, beyond\njust the few individuals\nwhose testimonials will\nend up on camera. This is\n\u201cIt was jarring\nto watch a\nwoman work\nthrough lifelong anxiety\nissues with\nsomething as\ncomparatively\nbanal as\nworking out in\nthe snow\u201d\n\u201cWhen first\ndescribing\nthe show\nto friends,\nthey had\nalready begun\nproposing\ndrinking\ngames to play\u201d\nlikely in part an attempt to\nhighlight more clothing\nfrom the company, but it\ngives the series a sense\nof community that it\nwouldn\u2019t have if it only\nfocused on Paltrow. The\nmost moving portions of\nGoop Lab come when\npeople share their past\ntraumas and receive love\nfrom others in return. Participants genuinely open\nup and find connection,\nfacilitated by whatever\nrandom thing the show\nhas them go through that\nweek. It was jarring to\nwatch a woman work\nthrough life-long anxiety\nissues with something\nas comparatively banal\nas working out in the\nsnow. However, it was\nultimately the therapy that\ncame through bonding\nwith others which comes\noff as more important\nthan the episodes\u2019 health\nfads du jour. This sense\nof sisterhood through\nshared experiences, along\nwith Goop\u2019s aspirational\nstatus, package well into\nself-contained half hour\nepisodes and make Goop\nLab tremendously watch-able.\nThe two best episodes\nare the ones about sex\nand psychedelics, perhaps\nbecause they are the\nfurthest from the esoter-ism that pervades the rest\nof the show. What was\nstriking about Goop when\nit talks about sex is how\nkindly and affectionately\nit is able to do so. In\nGoop\u2019s welcoming pastel\ncolour palate, the male\ngaze and shame that are\nso common in portrayals\nof female pleasure are\nwashed away. Guided by\nlegendary sex-educator\nBetty Dodson, Goop Lab\ngoes over the techniques\nof masturbation and\nconnects it to the feminist\nstruggle for social equality\n(even here I fully expect\nthat we will eventually\nsee the props involved\nas overpriced sex toys\non Goop\u2019s store, where\nthey have infamously\nsold $1500 vibrators).\nWhat appears to motivate\nPaltrow\u2019s curiosity is a\ndesire for radical freedom,\nunconstrained here by\nexpectations of women,\nbut also frequently else-where, by ability to spend\nand scientific efficacy. In\nanother episode, she will\nhave legitimate doctors\u2019\nrecommendations about\na healthy lifestyle intertwined with bunk about\ninjecting plasma from the\nblood back into her skin.\nWhile the doctor\u2019s face\ncontorts a little as she\ndescribes this, in my mind\nfrom shame or maybe as\nshe supresses a laugh, in\nthe text of the show what\nis scientifically supported\nand what is not can meld\ninto the something indis-tinguishable.\ninsert into your vagina for\nalleged hygiene benefits,\ntheir products can come\noff as much ridiculous\nand potentially hazardous\nas they do alluring. When\nfirst describing the show to\nfriends, they had already\nbegun proposing drinking\ngames to play while\nwatching. A highpoint\ncomes during the episode\non energy fields, where a\ngroup of Goop employees\nreceive therapy from a\n\u2018masseur\u2019 who does not\nso much touch them but\nwaves his hands in the air\n30cm above their backs.\nHe first tries it on one of\nhis long-time customers,\nwho writhes and squirms\nas he walks around and\nlightly wiggles his wrist\nlike a minimalist Nintendo\nWii player, before moving\nonto the rest of the people\nin the room. After such\na display, I\u2019m not sure\nif there is anyone who\nwouldn\u2019t want to let out\nat least a little moan, as\nthe Goopers all do, once\ntheir turn comes around,\njust to make sure they\u2019re\nnot missing out. It is not\ndifficult to see the marketing appeal of Goop as\nsomething similar.\nIs the background meant to resemble a vagina? Most likely.// Rachel Murray/Getty Images\nISSUE 1743\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nGoop has made a\nname for itself in mainstream consciousness for\ncourting controversy and\ngiving a platform to pseu-doscience, to the extent\nthey have been accused\nof trolling for publicity.\nWhether they are promoting colloidal silver, a\nsupplement that can turn a\nperson\u2019s skin permanently\nblue,orsellingjadeeggsto\n\n"

The\nplay was performed by\nmembers of Eschaton\nTheatre, founded late last\nyear with the vision of\nmaking theatre for \u2018the\nend of the world\u2019. Whilst\nnot quite armageddon, the\nplay certainly addresses\nissues that are rarely\ntouched upon: Anglo-Chinese relations, cultural\nassimilation, and heritage.\nDespite the play being\nset entirely in China, we\nonly see Chinese culture\nthrough the eyes of out-siders: the 20-something\nlooking to find himself,\nthe third-generation immigrant looking for her\nheritage, the weary expat\nsuffering from yellow\nfever, and the rich diplomat\u2019s son. Our only clue\ninto what life is really\nlike for a Beijing local\nare quips from Siu-See\nHung\u2019s character, including a poignant moment\nwhere she reminds Julian,\nthe male lead, that he\nis paid more than his\nChinese co-workers for\nno other reason than his\nBritish passport.\nJulian, played by East\nhimself, is introduced as\nan arrogant westerner who\nquickly grows uncomfortable and defensive when\nreminded of his identity,\nor lack thereof.\nThe imperialism of\nWestern culture makes\nJulian\u2019s whiteness a visa,\ngiving him the stamp of\n\u2018normal\u2019 wherever he\ngoes, including Beijing.\nWhen questioned \u2018Why\nChina?\u2019, he does not have\na better reason than cheap\ndumplings, reducing a\ncomplex culture down\nto palatable, bite-sized\npieces. This feels particularly sour in comparison\nto Lisa, a character of\nChinese descent, whose\nparents prioritised\nassimilation into UK\nculture over teaching her\nMandarin. She doesn\u2019t\nhave the luxury of picking\nand choosing parts of her\nculture; her \u2018otherness\u2019 in\nboth the UK and China\nisolates her in a way Julian\nwill never understand.\nHung\u2019s role as Lisa is\nan ode to the diaspora of\nimmigrant children. Her\ncharacter experiences\ndifficulties that are sure\nto resonate with those\nof mixed heritage in the\naudience: estrangement,\nidentity policing, and an\ninability to communicate\nin one\u2019s mother tongue.\nThe difficulty in being\ncaught between two\ncultures was captured perfectly in a scene where a\nwaitress\u2019 friendly camaraderie was cut short when\nshe realised Lisa couldn\u2019t\nspeak Mandarin.\nAcclaimed poet Xu Zhi\nMo\u2019s \u2018Saying Goodbye\nto Cambridge Again\u2019 was\na recurring motif in the\nplay:\n\u2018Quietly I left,\nAs quietly as I\ncame.\u2019\nThe poem reflects on\nthe freedom and mobility\nof wealthier Western\nexpats and captures\nRoberts story arc aptly.\nRobert, an expat, marries\na Chinese woman who\nbarely speaks English\nbefore beginning a stilted\nromance with Lisa.\nRobert is 1 of 3\nmain characters who\nis associated with the\nuniversity of Cambridge,\nundoubtedly a reference\nto the insurmountable\npressure on Chinese youth\nto excel academically.\nThis is seen most clearly\nin Ollie\u2019s story arc, who\nis humorously dubbed\nas a \u2018diplo-brat\u2019 epito-mising China\u2019s elite. His\ndeep-rooted issues with\nloneliness and inadequacy is an homage to the\nage-old saying \u2018money\ncan\u2019t buy happiness\u2019.\nDespite these artistic\nundertones, it was clearly\nan amateur production,\nwith dropped lines, incoherent transitions and at\ntimes unnatural scenes.\nEast had the herculean\ntask of exploring the\ncomplexities of cultural\nidentity in a 60 minute\nruntime, which made\ncertain aspects feel\nrushed. Whilst there were\nclear attempts to flesh out\nthe characters, at times\nit felt like a whistle-stop\ntour; briefly mentioning\nbut not expanding on\nhow characters dealt with\nabandonment, infidelity,\nand sexuality. Much of\nthe humour was related\nto the life of expats in\nChina, and is unlikely to\nbe accessible to people\nwho haven\u2019t experienced\nlife in China, or who don\u2019t\nspeak Mandarin.\nOverall, East\u2019s production captured the inexplicable feelings of cultural\ninsecurity well, and we left\nthe theatre contemplating\nwhether second-gen-eration immigrants are\nindeed lucky to have the\n\u2018best of both worlds\u2019. One\nof the greatest advantages\nof studying at Imperial\nis its location: London,\nthe cultural capital of the\nUK.

These\nareas include Silwood\nLodge, which provides\naccommodation for PhD\nstudents, and the Japanese\ngardens, which reps say\nhold deep sentimental\nvalue to Silwood students\nand staff.\nParallels have been\ndrawn to the sale of St.\nMary\u2019s, a medical campus\nin Paddington, last year.\nThe St. Mary\u2019s building\nheld high historic and sentimental value for medical\nstudents and alumni, none\nof whom were consulted\nprior to the sale decision\nannounced in July last\nyear.\nThe sale decision is\nparticularly controversial\ngiven that Silwood accommodation is reportedly increasing in price next\nyear \u2013 according to several\nSilwood staff and student\nreps, although no official\nfigures have been posted\nyet. Student representatives have questioned why\nrents are increasing when\nthe service and space\navailable on them will\nintentionally be cut. The\nCollege, however, has\nsaid that they are \u201ccommitted to re-provisioning\nfacilities, including social\nand recreational spaces,\nand aim to improve\nthem during this process\nwhile ensuring as little\ndisruption as possible\u201d,\nmeaning their perspective\nis that service will not be\nimpacted.\nThe areas for sale at\nSilwood are under the\ncontrol of the College\nEndowment, a body\nwhich manages property\nportfolios for the College\nwith a \u201cpurely investment focus\u201d, after being\ndeemed not \u201ccore to the\nacademic mission\u201d in\n2012. The Endowment is\ncontrolled by Alice Gast,\nthe College\u2019s President;\nMuir Sanderson, the College\u2019s CFO; David Begg,\nan Emeritus Professor of\nEconomics; and various\npartners which provide\nexternal oversight.\nThe lack of consultation with current student\nrepresentatives has been\nstrongly criticised, with\nthe Silwood Chair, Conor\nNicoll, offering a state-ment:\n\u201cEven if imperial\nwishes to brush off the\ndegradation of our campus\nas just another business\ntransaction, what\u2019s happening to Silwood is an\ninsult. It\u2019s an insult to our\nCollege to Sell Silwood\u2019s Buildings; Reps Say they\n\u201cWeren\u2019t Told\u201d\nFELIX\nNEWS\nFRIDAY, 14TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe College has sold part of Silwood campus, with plans to sell significantly more, while student representatives\nmaintain that they weren\u2019t consulted and were unaware of the sale\nmarginalised community\nwhich is too often for-gotten. Our marginalised\ncommunity which only\ngets attention with the\nsale of our property. But\nSilwood will stand strong\nand we will support our\ncommunity despite adver-sity. For those who wish\nto visit Silwood or study\nhere, I assure you, we will\nwelcome you with open\narms, even if there\u2019s less\nplaces to do so.\u201d\nThe situation highlights\nonce again a previ-ously-raised problem\nbetween students and\nthe College: running\nany consultations years\nin advance, with little\nsubsequent effort made\nto reach out to students\ncurrently at the College,\nmeans current students\nare left frustrated and in-the-dark. This is amplified\nat Silwood, where the\nmajority of students are\npostgraduates only here\nfor a year total. The Union\nPresident said: \"Students\naffected by major changes\nat the College deserve\nto be involved from the\nbeginning of the decision\nmaking process: as it\nstands, proactively engaging students and staff in\nthese matters isn't a high\nenough priority.\"\nA College spokesperson said:\n\u201cThe community will\nrecognise that areas such\nas the vacant Manor\nHouse are not core to the\nacademic mission of the\nCollege.

But why\ndid critics rebuke Black\nSabbath\u2019s first attempt,\nand if they\u2019re right, how\ndid it propel the band to\nthe fame they encounter\ntoday?\nTo answer these, we\nneed some background.\nBlack Sabbath were\nformed from an amalgamation of two failing\nBrummie bands in 1968,\nafter guitarist Tony Iommi\nand drummer Bill Ward\ngot in contact with singer\nOzzy Osbourne through\nhis ad, stating \u201cOZZY\nZIG Needs Gig \u2013 has own\nPA\u201d. The magical words\nmarking the beginning\nof metal itself. Osbourne\nbrought along his old\nbandmate, bassist Geezer\nButler, and together the\nfour were rebirthed as\nBlack Sabbath, with a\nfew stints as The Polka\nTulk Blues Band and\nEarth in between. In these\nearly days, the group\nmainly played old-school\nblues and jazz, with a\nbrief stint in Jethro Tull\nshaping Iommi\u2019s style in\nearly 1969. This can still\nbe heard in their later\nalbums as well as in Black\nSabbath. Soon after the\ngroup were picking up\ngigs and being peddled in\nfront of record labels in\nan attempt to be signed.\nThis wasn\u2019t successful.\nInstead they were told\nto play pop, with Butler\nsaying \u201cThey just didn\u2019t\nget it. So they tried to\nmake us a pop band\u201d.\nOsbourne made it overtly\nclear as well: \u201cSabbath\ndon\u2019t write fucking hit\nsingles\u201d. Despite this,\nwhen Sabbath hit the\nstudio in November\n1969, they recorded their\nregular setlist including\nthe pop-ier cover of\n\u2018Evil Woman\u2019 by Crow.\nAllegedly this took about\n12 hours to record, and\nthey were done in time\nfor last orders. In January\n1970, the record label\nPhilips took an interest\n\u201cCommercial\nand critical\nsuccess\nseemed to\ndiffer due\nto Sabbath\u2019s\nmysticism\u201d\n\u201cBended and\ndiscordant\nchords paired\nup with\nOsbourne\u2019s\nvoice.\u201d\nand released Sabbath\u2019s\ntake on a pop song \u2018Evil\nWoman\u2019; despite the\nsingle not charting, the\nnext month, Friday 13th\nFebruary, they release the\nentire album on Philips\u2019\nmore progressive label,\nFontana.\nBlack Sabbath hit the\ncharts, reaching number 8\nin the UK and eventually\nreaching 23 in the States\nwhen it was released\nlater that year. However,\nRolling Stone described\nthe album as having\n\u201cnothing to do with...\nanything much except\nstiff recitations of Cream\nclich\u00e9s that sound like the\nmusicians learned them\nout of a book\u201d. Big oof.\nYet critically the album\ndoesn\u2019t line up with its\ncommercial worth. This\nisn\u2019t massively saying\nmuch: critics can definitely be wrong (Rolling\nStone have admitted\nthey panned a few now\nlegendary albums, such as\nLed Zeppelin I and Nevermind), and the charts can\nreally, really be wrong as\nwell at the best of times.\nUltimately though the\ncommercial and critical\nresponse given to the\nalbum seemed to differ\ndue to the mysticism surrounding Black Sabbath\nat the time. Firstly, their\nname, taken from Boris\nKarloff\u2019s 1963 film of the\nsame name was intended\nto get people intrigued,\nwith Butler\u2019s logic at the\ntime being \u201cit was strange\nso many people spend so\nmuch money to see scary\nmovies\u201d. The title track\n\u2018Black Sabbath\u2019 kicks off\nthe album with Black Sabbath\u2019s now signature mix\nof suspenseful, doomy\nnoise which was at the\ntime a new kind of sound\nfrom a band in the charts.\nThe dread-filled songs,\nnow a Sabbath signature,\nfirst came from this song,\nbased upon a dream that\nButler had where he saw\nan apparition standing\nat the foot of his bed.\nUpon telling the rest of\nhis bandmates, Osbourne\nwrote the ominous lyrics\n\u201cWhat is this that stands\nbefore me?//Figure in\nblack which points at me\u201d.\nThis was accompanied\nby Iommi\u2019s distinctive\ndiscordant riff, apparently dubbed the \u201cdevil\u2019s\ntritone\u201d by classical\nmusic. Nowadays Butler\nfinds amusement in this\norigin story, explaining\n\u201cI always had...psychic\nexperiences. That was\none of the very last ones\nI had...that was before I\ndid drugs, by the way.\u201d.\nSabbath, not doing drugs?\nSounds spooky to me too.\nThanks to this song\nstyle, word got around\nthat Black Sabbath were\nSatanists, probably not\nhelped by other lyrics such\nas \u201cmy name is Lucifer,\nplease take my hand\u201d in\nthe song N.I.B. and the\nenchanting tale found in\nthe song \u2018The Wizard\u2019.\nSabbath\u2019s label played\nup to this, packaging the\nalbum up with an eerie\ncloaked figure on a pink-hued front cover, standing\nin the foreground of a\nchurch. The inner sleeve\nfeatured an inverted\ncross and a dark poem\nwithin it. These rumours\nwere further fuelled by\nthe album release in the\nStates which is rumoured\nto have been launched by\nAnton Lavey, the head\nof the Church of Satan.\nPotentially, the juxtaposition between critical and\ncommercial success of\nthis album may have been\ndown to this hype around\nthe \u201cSatanist\u201d band: consumers wanted to know\nwhat it was about, whereas\ncritics may have expected\nmore from what is realistically Sabbath\u2019s blues-iest\nalbum. However, saying\nthis does not mean Black\nSabbath should not get\nthe credit it deserves as\none of the first heavy\nmetal albums. Nearly all\nof the other songs on the\nalbum featured Iommi\u2019s\nguitar style heavily, characteristic to him because\nof his adapted playing to\nincorporate his plastic-fin-gertips, and it was these\nslowed down, bended\nand discordant chords\ncombined with Osbourne\ndistinctive voice which\npushed the band in the\nheavy direction. In the end\nit was these two quirks of\nthe band, along with their\nblues background, which\nevolved their sound into\nthe beginnings of a new\ngenre.\nThe eerie figure in black featured was the inspiration for the title track // Wikimedia\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial Staff to Strike in February and March\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nA\ncademic staff\nat the College\nhave voted to\ngo on strike\nin response to the ongoing national pension\nnegotiations, as well as\na local pay dispute with\nthe College itself.\nThere are fourteen\nplanned strike days across\nthe span of four weeks,\nfrom Thursday 20th\nFebruary to Friday 13th\nMarch. The final week,\nfrom 9th to 13th March,\nis a full strike week.\nParticipating staff will not\nattend work \u2013 meaning\ntheir research, teaching,\nand administrative work\nwill not be fulfilled.\nThe action follows on\nfrom the University and\nCollege Union (UCU)\nstrikes conducted towards\nthe end of last year \u2013\nwhich the Imperial UCU\ncould not participate in\ndue to an under-50%\nturnout in earlier strike\nballots \u2013 and the strikes\ntwo years ago, which resulted in cancelled contact\ntime for Imperial students,\nas well as causing certain\nexams to be rewritten to\naccommodate for content\nthat had not been taught.\nThe national pensions\ndispute centres around the\nUniversity Superannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 the\npension scheme on which\nmost university staff are\nenrolled \u2013 increasing its\nrequired contributions\nfor both employees and\nemployers. This is in reaction to an internal USS\nassessment of the value of\nits fund, which it decided\nwas in deficit. However,\nother parties have disputed this valuation and its\nmethodology \u2013 such as the\nJoint Expert Panel.\nThe strikes in 2018\nresulted in the establishment of a Joint Expert\nPanel (JEP) comprised of\nUCU and university employers\u2019 representatives\n\u2013 which was the primary\nreason for ending the last\nround of action. The UCU\nfeels that the JEP findings\nhave been overruled by\nthe USS executive, with\ntwo pension contribution\nincreases already imposed\nand another planned in the\nnext 18 months, resulting\nin staff having to pay an\nadditional 38% in contri-butions. This has resulted\nin a sense of \u201cbetrayal\u201d\namongst university staff\naccording to the Imperial\nUCU.\nThe Imperial UCU\nthus voted to join national\nout at the same time as\nthe pension ballot, had a\nturnout of 56.4%, with\n67.9% voting for strike\naction and 84.2% for\n\u2018action short of a strike\u2019.\nThe Imperial UCU is\ntherefore rolling this\nissue together with their\nfrom the College management rejected by the\nJoint Trade Unions at the\nCollege (which represent\nall staff at Imperial).\nThe news of the strikes\nover both pay and pensions broke shortly after\nthe Independent revealed\nthat Alice Gast, Imperial\nCollege\u2019s President, has\nthe highest salary of any\nuniversity head in the\nUK, at \u00a3554,000 \u2013 a full\n\u00a363,000 above the sec-ond-highest at LSE.\nPart of this is because\nshe has opted out of the\nsame pension which is\ncurrently under national\nfire, and receives both her\nown employee contribution and the College\u2019s employer contribution as part\nof her salary, according\nto the College\u2019s 2018-19\nAnnual Report. Her withdrawal from the pension\nscheme essentially undermines it and exacerbates\nthe USS\u2019 claimed fund\ndeficit \u2013 if high earners\ndo not contribute their\nequivalently large pension\ninput, then it essentially\nincreases the perceived\ndeficit.\nMichael McGarvey, the\nhead of the Imperial staff\nunion (Imperial UCU),\nsaid:\n\u201cWe have a grim\ndetermination to resolve\nthese disputes properly.\nWe don\u2019t take this action\nlightly \u2013 the impact on\nstudents is the greatest\nconcern we had when\nvoting. Students and\ntheir education are often\nused as hostages in these\nsituations, with blame\napportioned to striking\nstaff. However, not taking\naction about pay and\npensions affects students\nin the long-run; if people\nare disillusioned with\nworking at universities,\nwe can\u2019t recruit and keep\nworld-class staff.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still had no\ndirect contact over the pay\ndispute from the College\nmanagement, despite our\noffer to meet with them\nover a week ago.\u201d\nThe College, mean-while, has sent out all-staff\nand all-student emails and\npublished FAQs. In the\nformer, they expressed\n\u201cdisappointment\u201d that the\nnational UCU had decided\nto strike, and regarding\nthe local pay dispute asserted that they had local\npay rates \u201camongst the\nbest in the UK sector.\u201d In\nthe FAQs, they clarified\nthat \u2013 just as two years\nago \u2013 no reimbursement\nfor tuition fees would be\noffered, regardless of any\npotential rescheduling\nor missed content. Any\nstaff salaries lost due to\nstriking will, however, be\nheld in a central fund to be\nredistributed and fed back\ninto student education.\nThese FAQs are accessible at http://www.\nimperial.ac.uk/human-re-sources/industrial-action/\nEditor\u2019s Note: for more\ndetail of the pay dispute\nat Imperial, see \u2018Strike\nAction: Pensions and\nPay\u2019 from 29th November\n2019.

It\nmeans I can have one\nconsole dedicated to each\ncompany set up on my\ndesk and actually get to\nplay older games at uni\nagain! For some it also\nmeans that they could sell\ntheir older consoles and\nuse that money to fund\na new one \u2013 and for collectors it means they can\nmuch more easily switch\nbetween games on the \ufb02y\nwithout having to switch\naround cables every two\nminutes.\nAnother positive that\ncomes from this is the possibility of certain games\nbeing enhanced for the\nnext generation consoles.\nWe have already seen\nthis a bit with the Xbox\nOne, enhancing Xbox\n360 games via software\nupdates \u2013 it\u2019s a great thing\nto see from businesses\nthat are usually driven by\npro\ufb01t and not much else\u2026\nWonderful 101 port\nPlatinum Games, the\ndeveloper that brought\nyou Bayonetta, Viewtiful\nJoe and Astral Chain\nhave \ufb01nally begun their\nforay into self-publishing.\nEarly in January, the \ufb01rm\nsecured funding from\nTencent to accelerate its\nself-publishing ambition.\nDespite this, Platinum is\nseeking funding from us,\nthe gamers. They set up a\nKickstarter campaign for\nthe creation of a remaster\nof the somewhat forgotten\nWii U game \u2018Wonderful\n101\u2019. With their funding\ngoal set at a little under\n\u00a340,000 it seemed like\nthat would be easily\npassed. Well, it was, by\nan insane margin. So\nmuch so that at the time\nof writing the campaign\nsits at \u00a31,220,000 of\n\u201cPlatinum\nset up a\nKickstarter\ncampaign for\nthe creation\nof a remaster\nof Wonderful\n101.\u201d\n\u201cAnimal\ncrossing is not\ngoing to allow\ncloud saving.\nYup, you read\nthat right!\u201d\nfunding with 24 days still\nto go! That means that\nnot only is Wonderful\n101 being ported to the\nSwitch, but also a Steam\nversion, a PS4 version,\na time attack mode (yay\nspeedruns), and a new 2D\nside scrolling adventure\nin the Wonderful 101\nuniverse named \u201cLuka\u2019s\nFirst Mission\u201d.\nI have never played\nWonderful 101, so the\nopportunity to do so\nwould be awesome. There\nis a passionate and vocal\nfanbase for this action-ad-venture games that has\nclearly shown up in spades\nto support Platinum.\nWith released slated for\nNovember 2020, I sit in\ngreat anticipation for the\nchance to \ufb01nally give this\nniche title a go.\nAnother intriguing\nevent that has occurred\nwith this Kickstarter, is\na mysterious website\ndubbed \u201cThe Platinum\nFour\u201d. So far the website\njust shows 4 items on a\npage, with a giant \u20184\u2019 at\nthe top. The \ufb01rst of these\nitems is the Wonderful\n101 port, with the other\nthree simply labelled\n\u2018coming soon\u2019. This has\ncaused a lot of active\ndiscussion in the gaming\ncommunity with many\ndifferent theories as to\nwhat else could be coming\nfrom Platinum in future\nmonths. My opinion?\nI\u2019m glad you asked kind\nstranger! One of these\nHAS to be Bayonetta 3.\nIt was announced with a\nteaser trailer over 2 years\nago and we haven\u2019t heard\nanything else since about\nit. I also think that one\nannouncement may come\nthat won\u2019t shock too many\npeople: a port of Astral\nChain to other consoles.\nAstral Chain was a big\nsuccess for Platinum on\nthe Switch last year, and\nnow with funding from\nTencent, I imagine that\nthey will be looking to\nexpand the install size for\nAstral Chain. My \ufb01nal\nprediction is more of a\nhope. I would love to\nsee Viewtiful Joe either\nported to the Switch, or, if\nwe want to go really crazy,\nmaybe even a sequel!\nAnimal Crossing\nAnimal Crossing New\nHorizons is the next\nupcoming installation\nin the Animal Crossing\nfranchise, and the \ufb01rst\nto release on the Switch.\nIt is greatly anticipated\nby many, with its wide\nappeal and addictive daily\ngameplay loot of collecting bugs and fruit, all the\nwhile trying to clear your\ndebt with Tom Nook. So,\nhow could a game that\nseems so friendly on the\nsurface end up garnering\nso much controversy.\nWell \u2013 Nintendo is acting\nlike a grandma again and\nnot keeping up with the\ntechnology of today!\nFirstly, Animal\nCrossing is not going to\nallow cloud saving. Yup,\nyou read that right! If\nyou lose your Switch or it\nbreaks, there is no hope of\ngetting your island back!\nNintendo\u2019s reasoning\nbehind this is that the\ngame uses time mechanics and having a cloud\nsave might allow players\nto effectively rewind time.\nNow I would understand\nthis reason if Animal\nCrossing was a competitive game, but come\non\u2026 it\u2019s freaking Animal\nCrossing! Not only this,\nbut also you are only\nallowed one island per\nSwitch. That means if you\nhave multiple accounts\nyou can still only have\none island. Even if you\nbuy a second game you\nare limited to one island,\ndespite the fact you have\npaid for 2 games. I think\nthis is quite frankly ri-diculous. People who use\ntheir Switch as a family\ndevice with multiple\naccounts for whoever\nuses this are bound to\nget very annoyed. On the\nbright side, Nintendo have\nacknowledged the fan\nbacklash and are looking\nfor ways of \ufb01xing it in\ntime \u2013 Nintendo have a\ngood history of listening\nto fans (in recent years\nat least) so at least we\ncan hope they go back on\nthese statements by the\ntime the game is out on\nMarch 20th.\nThe Kickstarter for Wonderful101 Remastered is unbelievably successful! // Kickstarter\n\n"

Be honest, we\u2019ve\nall hit a paparazzi with our\ncar or been blacklisted by\nthe Chinese government,\nbut imagine how much\nharder that is to deal with\nwhen people are also\nstarting petitions to have\nyou removed from your\ncounty. Considering our\nboy Justin stepped into the\nlimelight over a decade\nago he\u2019s certainly proven\nhis stamina for a public\nbashing. All that\u2019s in the\npast now though. Bieber\ntook a hiatus at the beginning of last year, now\nhe\u2019s getting married\u2026\nJustin Bieber who? Barely\nrecognisable.\nIf his marketing team\nare pushing an image of\na more mature Bieber\nthat\u2019s fine, no qualms with\nthat it\u2019s about time. We\u2019d\nbelieve them if this wasn\u2019t\nthe seventeenth time\nthey\u2019ve tried this strategy.\nThough, heads will turn\nif you start using scuzzy\ntactics to get your new\nsingle to number one.\n\u2018Surreal\u2019 is an understatement when you\ngo through the list of\nthings the Bieber team\nhas been doing to try and\nget \u201cYummy\u201d to number\none. Seven videos for\n\u201cYummy\u201d were released\n\u201cThis\nconcoction of\ncomplete fuck-upery that has\nwon me over\u201d\non youtube: official, lyric,\nfan lip sync, beliebers\nreact, animated, food\nfight, and yet another\nanimated video. Why?\nBecause Billboard counts\nall those views as streams.\nOn an Instagram post\nBieber asked fans to put\nthe song on repeat while\nthey sleep, buy the song\nregardless of streaming\nservices already used and\neven purchase a VPN so\nthat they could stream the\nsong onAmerican servers.\nThe peak of this fever\ndream was when Bieber\nrandomly started posting\nphotos of unknown babies\non his Instagram with the\ncaption \u201c#yummy\u201d. The\namount of other dumb\nshit they did could fill\nthis page, but you can just\nlook it up if you\u2019re still\ninterested. Needless to\nsay, the music community\nwas quick to lampoon this\ncon.\n\u201cYummy\u201d only made it\nto number two in the end,\noof.\nThe song is bad that\u2019s\nwhy. All around poor\nchoices were made and\nyet I can\u2019t help but love\nall of it so very much. The\nsatisfaction is similar to\nwatching the video of Post\nMalone\u2019s crowd surfing\nfail or Travis Scott falling\noff stage in autotune.\nTeam Bieber gave themselves a big ol\u2019 wedgie.\nThere\u2019s a fantastic\nsong by the comedian Bo\nBurnham called \u201cRepeat\nStuff\u201d that takes the piss\nout of the music industry\u2019s\napproach to writing songs.\nHe points out that music\nfrom One Direction, Justin\nBieber, Usher and many\nothers is written to be as\nvague as possible so that\nanyone can think the song\nis about themselves. The\nsame thing has happened\nwith \u201cYummy\u201d and it\u2019s so\nridiculous that it\u2019s almost\nbecome self-parody. The\nfirst song released about\nBieber\u2019s wife, Hailey\nBaldwin, is one of his\nvaguest and stupidest\nsongs to date.\nIt isn\u2019t just music\ncritics with their heads up\ntheir own asses that think\nthis either. The general reception from most is that\nBiebers return has been\npainfully mediocre.\nThe obvious blunder is\nthe use of \u201cyummy\u201d as a\nsexy word, which it isn\u2019t.\nAlso, using \u201cyummy\u201d like\nthat makes the posting\nof baby pictures with the\ncaption \u201c#Yummy\u201d a lot\ncreepier. Lyrically the\nsong lacks any substance\nand there are a couple\nweird choices like when\nBieber calls Hailey a\n\u201cBona fide stallion\u201d \u2026\nwhich is the male horse.\nThe song has six writing\ncredits, yes, it took six\npeople to write this song.\nDid no one proofread this\nthing? Did all six of these\n\u201cprofessionals\u201d think this\nwas an appropriate song\nfor a man to sing about his\nwife? I just hope Bieber\ndidn\u2019t hire them to help\nwrite his vows.\nYouTube commentary comedian Danny\nGonzalez covered this\nbeautiful car crash of a\nsingle release and made\na parody song. Honestly,\non a technical level the\nparody song has better\nlyrics.\nThe production\nelements on \u201cYummy\u201d\nare all tight. Beliebers\ndefinitely aren\u2019t tuning\nin for new experimental\nstuff but the instrumental\nis surprisingly basic - a\npalatable summer chill\nbeat that anyone could\ngroove to. Everything in\nthis song has been done\nbefore. There\u2019s not much\nelse to say, it\u2019s a very\nsimple song.\nThe sum of all the\nmusical missteps and promotion scandals makes\n\u201cYummy\u201d one of Biebers\nworst songs to date, and\nit\u2019s this concoction of\ncomplete fuck-upery\nthat has won me over. A\nbit of dumb fun that no\none is taking seriously.\nSomething special about\nthat. So, I stand with the\ndie-hard Beliebers on this\none. It may not have made\nit to #1 on the charts but\n\u201cYummy\u201d is #1 in my\nheart.\nJB eyeing up that number one spot // Justin Bieber/Youtube\nArtwork for JB\u2019s yummy new single // Wikimedia\n\n"

But the\ndata collected in this study\nover a longer timeframe\n(known as longitudinal\ndata) allows for a more\nnuanced understanding of\nintra- and inter-individual\ndifferences.\nDr Giorgio Quer, part\nof the research team, considers this a rich source\nof information; obtaining\nlongitudinal data not only\nallows individuals to\nhave an insight into their\nown health parameters,\nbut when collated across\npopulations, it can help\nscientists to refine their\nunderstanding of diseases,\nsupport earlier diagnoses,\nspot infections quicker,\nor eventually, determine\nthe effects of longer-term\nfactors such as environmental changes.\nHe describes one of\ntheir major findings on in-ter-individual differences.\n\u201cIt was exciting to observe\nthat the resting heart rate\nof different individuals\nvaries widely \u2013 what is\nnormal for you, may be\nunusual for someone else,\nand suggest an illness.\u201d\nThe team found that our\nheart rate can actually\nvary by up to 70 bpm from\nperson to person, from as\nlow as 40 to as high as 109\nbpm.\nBut, surprisingly, age\nand sex, two common\nculprits for population\ndifferences, were only\nminimally associated with\nthis difference. Resting\nheart rate was found to\nvary according to age\n(increasing to the age of\n50, then declining with\nadvancing age) and sex\n(women\u2019s heart rates\nwere, on average, 2-3 bpm\nhigher than men\u2019s), but\ntogether, they accounted\nfor only 6% of this var-iation. Even when the\nteam included Body Mass\nIndex (BMI) and sleep du-ration, no more than 10%\nof the difference could be\nexplained.\nIntra-individual variations also uncovered\nintriguing findings. The\ngreatest variability in any\nindividual data was found\nin women of child-bearing\nage,whichDrQuerandthe\nteam believe could help\nsupport our understanding\nof reproductive health.\nIn fact, current fertility\napplications incorporate\nresting heart rate\ndata to help identify stages of the\nmenstrual cycle.\n\u201cWealsofound\na surprising seasonal variation\nin heart rate that\nwas lowest in\nJuly, and peaked\nafter the holidays\nat the end of the\nyear.\u201d\nThe team speculate this may be\ndue to changing\nexercise habits\nthroughout the\nSeasonal average resting\nheart rate pattern// PLOS\nONE (CC BY 4.0)\nA\nlzheimer\u2019s\ndisease (AD) is\nthe most prevalent form of\ndementia, characterised\nby a progressive decline\nof cognitive skills, associated with a build-up of\ntoxic amyloid molecules\nforming plaques, and an\nincrease in the activated form of tau protein.\nChanges in specific brain\npatterns, called gamma\nbrainwaves, have now\nbeen linked to AD.\nResearchers from\nMIT found that artificial\ninduction of these gamma brainwaves, which\nGamma Brainwaves: Hoax or New Therapeutic\nAvenue?\nhave a frequency of\n~40Hz, by sound, as well\nas combined light and\nsound stimuli, decreased\nnegative pathological\nfeatures of AD, such as\namyloid build-up, while\nsimultaneously increasing\nthe presence of microglia,\nthe brain\u2019s immune cells,\nin mice models. An improvement in the region\nresponsible for memory\nconsolidation and spatial\nmemory was also ob-served.\nPreviously, the team\ndemonstrated that light\nflickering at 40Hz was\nable to artificially induce\ngamma brainwaves in\nmice, which reduced the\namount of amyloid while\nincreasing the amount\nof microglia within the\nbrain. Now, the authors\ntested whether these\nbrainwaves can also be\ninduced by sound stim-ulation. In addition to\nimprovement of memory\nconsolidation and spatial\nmemory, a drop in amy-loid levels and amyloid\nplaques was seen within\nvarious brain regions.\nMicroglia, which are\nresponsible for amyloid\nclearance, increased in\nboth number and size,\nand co-localised with\namyloid within the brain,\nsuggesting increased\namyloid uptake. A larger\nblood vessel diameter\nin the brain was also\nobserved; since amyloid\nclearance can also occur\nvia blood vessels, this\nsuggests more potential\nfor waste clearance.\nNext, the researchers\ntested the combination of\nlight and sound stimulation together, which again\nsuccessfully resulted\nin induction of gamma\nbrainwaves in multiple\nbrain regions. Amyloid\nlevels were reduced,\nwhile microglia increased\n\u2013 the same as with\nsound stimulation alone.\nHowever, the combined\nstimuli also increased the\nnumber of microglia per\nplaque, and the microglia\nsurrounded the amyloid\ndeposits, rather than simply being present nearby.\nThese effects occurred\nnot just in the brain\nregions specific to visual\nand auditory responses,\nbut also in brain areas responsible for higher-order\nbrain functions, in particular short-term memory and executive function\n\u2013 importantly, effects here\nwere not seen with either\nstimulus alone.\nThe question that remains is how these effects\noccur: are the combined\neffects a result of one\nstimulus influencing\nthe other, or simply an\naddition of both bene-fits? Lead author Chinnakkaruppan Adaikkan\nstated, \u201cWhile we know it\naffects pathology in mice,\nwe want to understand\nhow because that will\nhelp us understand and\nrefine potential treatment.\u201d\nSimple light or sound\nstimulation can induce\neffects in multiple cell\ntypes and different brain\nareas, decreasing the\nharmful features of AD\nand improving brain\nfunction in genetically engineered mouse\nmodels. This is even\nmore widespread when\nboth stimulation types are\ncombined, highlighting\nthe potential of something\nso simple to treat a very\ncomplex disease. However, further research is required to understand how\nthis artificial stimulation\ncan be related to naturally\noccurring brainwaves,\nand whether this could be\nextended to humans.\nBut, while it might\nnot be transferrable for\nhuman AD treatment\nanytime soon, listening\nto those gamma wave-in-ducing Spotify playlists\nsurely can\u2019t hurt.\nSCIENCE\nJulia Dabrowska\nScience Editor\nyear (read: we are lazier at\nChristmas) but also want\nto investigate the effect of\nclimate and latitude on our\nheart rates in the future.\n\n"

    "content": "What is Albion? The play\nmay just answer that!\nPapa Papel (eng: Father\nPaper)\nB\nefore going to\nthe play, I had\nto google what\nAlbion was. My\nsearch revealed that, in\nLatin and Celtic, it could\nmean white, rock or crag.\nAlbion also used to be a\npoetic name for Britain.\nNevertheless, not understanding the name did\nnot ruin the experience\nfor me. Albion, written by\nMike Bartlett and directed\nby Rupert Gold, is a rich\nplay with substance.\nSome examples of ideas\nexplored include nostal-gia, heritage, social class\nand the process mourning\nfollowing a loss.\nAs I came in 5 minutes\nlate, we were placed in\nan obstructed view seat\nfor the first two thirds of\nthe play. Following the\ninterval, I was relocated\nclose to the front row,\nwhich gave me a vastly\ndifferent perspective.\nBeing in the obstructed\nseat, the play had to be\nbig and clear enough for\nus at the back seats to feel\nthe emotion and it did just\nthat. However, at the front\nfew seats the experience\nwas phenomenal and\nmade you feel like you\nwere peering into the lives\nof the characters.\nWhat was quite impressive about Albion is that\nthe whole play Miriam\nBuether\u2019s set was based\nin the same garden. The\nscene changes were subtle\nand helped aid the idea of\nthe passage of time and\nthe changes that come\nwith it. The music was\nchosen well, and I found\nmyself wanting to request\nthe names of some of the\nsongs played.\nThe acting from the\noverall cast was very\nstrong, however there\nwere a few points that felt\nscreechy and overacted.\nDespite this, I found\nmyself enjoying the\ndifferent styles that each\nactor brought to stage.\nSome parts of the plot\nwere quite extravagant\nand appeared slightly\nrandom to me however,\nfor the most part, a lot of\nthe creative choices felt\npurposeful.\nThis play was quite\nunique, which made it\nquite difficult to compare\nit to my previous expe-riences. The lighting by\nNeil Austin couldn\u2019t also\ngo unappreciated since I\nfound it helped focus the\naudience on the pivotal\ncharacters at chaotic parts.\nThe audience, I felt, were\ngrounded the whole time.\nMy favourite scene which\nI felt was presented the\nmost effectively is the\nappearance of the dead\nson, which is still vivid in\nmy mind.\nOverall, Albion was\nan incredibly enjoyable\nexperience, with each\nmember of the cast and\ncreative team bringing\nsomething unique to the\ntable in this impressive\nproduction.\nI\nf there\u2019s something\neven non-arts-lovers\nknow about art, it\u2019s\nPicasso: he is the\ndefinition of true artistic\ngenius. With countless exhibitions since his young\nage of 13 in 1895, a whole\nmuseum about him in\nParis, and with some stating that there\u2019s virtually\nnothing in modern art that\nhe hasn\u2019t started, curating\na Picasso exhibition with\na novel feel to it in today\u2019s\nday and age is a sincere\nchallenge.\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nhas taken on this with\na storm (storm Ciara?)\nwith their new exhibition\n\u201cPicasso and Paper\u201d. The\nexhibition attempts to\nexplore Picasso\u2019s different\nphases through his love\nfor paper. Throughout the\n10 decades he blessed the\nearth with his art, it turns\nout he showed his love for\npaper in many different\nways.\nHe folded it, burned it,\nripped it, cut it in clever\nways and glued it all\ntogether again. He drew\ncheeky sketches in Vogue\nmagazines and folded gui-tar-like pieces out of card\nand strings. His naivete\nand curious exploring\nof different techniques\nshows a new side of this\nepic man. It is easy to\nforget that people like\nPicasso weren\u2019t always\ngood at art. But when\nyou\u2019re standing in front of\na framed 2 inch skull he\u2019s\nripped out of yellowing\npaper during WWII when\nmaterials were scarce, his\nartistic process suddenly\nfeels more tangible.\nPicasso and Paper has\ngot a lot more than ripped\npieces of paper to offer. It\nfeatures a lot of his more\nconventional works too.\nThere\u2019s a huge wall-sized\ncanvas made of cut out\npieces of different types\nof wallpaper. At first this\npiece has a lot of chaotic\nenergy, but the more you\nlook, the more details\ncome out, and the three\nwomendepictedentangled\nin their mundane activities\ncome alive. If there is one\nthing that is clear through\nthis extensive exhibition\n(the website tells you to\nallow at least 1-2 hours\nfor it) it is that Picasso\nhas gone through as many\nphases as there are stars in\nthe sky. The blue period,\nthe rose period. The phase\nwhere he made really big,\nround facial features. The\nphase when he drew no\nfaces at all. Phases based\non the different women\nin his life, of which there\nwere many. Phases where\nhe just printed newspaper\nletters on things, or etched\ncopper.\nOne thing is clear from\nall these years of different\nart created by Picasso; he\nwas always a genius. No\nwonder his father, a professor of art and an artist\nhimself, gave up painting\nwhen Picasso surpassed\nhim at age 13. If you visit\nPicasso and Paper you\nmight feel like giving up\npainting too.\nA fresh exhibition showcasing the works of Picasso // Royal Academy of Arts\nAn epic example of character interaction // Marc Brenner\nISSUE 1743\nFELIX\n9\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDeniz Ak\nArts Writer\nWhere?

While the\nYouTube cooking video\ngenre is already saturated\nwith huge personalities\nsuch as the cast of the\nBon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen,\nMaangchi , and Binging\nwith Babish, Paris Hilton\nhas managed to find her\nniche (intentionally or\nnot) in the world of ab-surdist comedy cooking.\nStarting off by introducing us to her confused\nlooking chihuahua,\nDiamond Poodle, nestled\nin the crook of her arm, she\nproceeds to let him roam\nfree in the kitchen while\nshe boasts about how\ngood she is at cooking.\n\u201cAs you all know,\u201d she\nbegins, \u201cWell, maybe not\nall of you know. People\nwho do know, know that\nI\u2019m an amazing cook\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a masterclass in verbal\nswings and roundabouts,\na style that is possibly\ninspired by our mod-ern-day politicians filibustering to oppose women\u2019s\nrights or declare climate\nchange a non-issue.\nAccording to her\naccounts, she spent her\nchildhood in the kitchen,\nhelping her mother do\nthe cooking and baking.\nHowever, cracks very\nquickly begin to appear\nin her story when she\nreveals that she has never\nused dried pasta before,\ndumping them all into\na pot of cold water and\npromising that they will\nshrink as they cook so\nthey will eventually be\nsubmerged. What follows\nis a comedy of errors\n\u2013 anything that could\npossibly go wrong does\ngo wrong.\nSwanning around in an\nadmittedly adorable top,\nher curtain of long blonde\nhair violating every health\ncode, she declares an\nassortment of cooking\nutensils as \u201cso brutal\u201d,\ntips a salt-mine\u2019s worth\nof salt all over the hobs\nand into her beef which\nshe was \u201ctanning\u201d (before\nadding Himalayan pink\nsalt as a \u201cspice\u201d), forgets\nto add the onions and\ngarlic (\u201cI feel my lasagne\nshould not have onion or\ngarlic in it\u201d), and has no\nidea what ricotta is even\nthough she brings way too\nmuch.As can be expected,\nthere\u2019s generous amounts\nof product placement in\nthe form of health drinks,\n\u201cunicorn mist\u201d and maybe\nher sunglasses but there\nalso additions like a\nwhole shop-front display\nof tea-towels emblazoned\nwith catchy phrases like\n\u201callergic to bullshit\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s most puzzling\nabout the whole thing\nisn\u2019t the motion-sickness\ninducing camerawork, nor\nis it the complete lack of\nrecipe details (how much\nricotta are you supposed\nto use?) but her fingerless\nleather gloves she wears\nthroughout the cooking\nprocess even after having\npicked up Diamond\nBaby with them on. She\ndescribes them as her\nchef gloves but they\u2019re\nunlike any chef gloves\nI\u2019ve ever seen.

But who\nare these people, what\nis their legacy? Why\nare they participating in\nshameless self promotion\nby having an article in\nFelix for Varsity 2020? I\nhave caught up with two\nof the captains playing on\nFriday 28th\nfor a chat.\nSasha is the captain\nfor LUSL 1s. He\u2019s young\nbut experienced, playing\nfor BUCS alongside his\ncaptainship. LUSL 1s\nare composed primarily\nof BUCS players and\nOrlando \u2013 a legend who\nfor some reason, has\nrecently disappeared.\nWhether he was there in\nthe first place remains to\nbe seen. Tom is the captain\nfor LUSL2s \u2013 quirky, with\npowerful dance moves, he\n#ups the twos with a sense\nof identity and purpose.\nThe 2s are a mixed bunch\n\u2013 most of them start\nout as beginners when\nthey join the club and\nstay there for the banter\nthat is passed through\ngenerations of 2s players.\nFrom very old (Petros) to\nones that look like a mop\n(Lancemop) they rise past\nall limitations and surpass\neveryone\u2019s expectations.\nHere are the secrets to\ntheir success.\nNastya: What teams\nare in your league\nand who have you\nplayed so far?\nSasha: We have only\nplayed a couple of games\nso far. We play UCL in\ntheir square pool, who we\nhave destroyed, Imperial\n2s, Imperial Medics and\nBarts 2s, who we have to\nbeat because somehow\nthey\u2019re at the top of the\nleague so far.\nTom: We play most\nother unis \u2013 Bartholomew\u2019s, KCL, UCL,\nImperial Medics. So far,\nwe have only lost against\nKCL and 1sts. Unless you\ncount that time when we\nwon against the medics,\nbut conceded the game\nbecause we brought too\nmany players.\nNastya: How did you\nform and train the\nteams?\nSasha: Usually\neveryone has training\nMonday, Wednesday\nand Friday. LUSL has a\nsession on Saturday and\nBUCS has a session on\nSunday. We encouraged\neveryone to come as\nmuch as possible, and\nerages\u2026 No, I\u2019m joking,\nbut we have a Saturday\nsession only for LUSL,\nso we\u2019re not intimidated\nby the BUCS players any\nmore \u2013 that\u2019s been really\nhelpful. The most important thing to training is\nto have good team spirit,\nshit chat and banter on the\nside.\nNastya: What is your\nteam like and how do\nyou involve every-one?\nSasha: Our team is made\nup of mainly BUCS\nplayers, as this year we\nhave had a large joining\nof experienced 4th\nyears\nand complete begin-ners, and Orlando. He\u2019s\ndisappeared recently, but\nwe miss him and hope\nhe comes back. Since\nthe LUSL rules state that\nthere must be two girls in\nthe water at all time, our\nteam is split about evenly\nfor girls and boys \u2013 I\nusually have 5 girls on\nthe team per game. That\nway Alex is in goal, two\ngirls are outfield, two on\nthe bench.\nTom: There\u2019s 21\nplayers in the team. For\nthe first time ever we\u2019ve\nhad enough girls to have\na BUCS team and girls to\nplay on the LUSL team\nonly. I have appointed\nClem as my \u201cgo to\u201d girl\nin the LUSL 2s team. I\nthink in the group chat,\nI can come off as a little\nintimidating, and not quite\nas approachable as I\u2019d like\nto be, especially for the\ngirls. Clem always talks\nto them and gets them to\nplay. She also does the\nsubs \u2013 she knows more\nabout how much they\nwant to play, ect. I just\nhave to be conscious when\nwriting Facebook posts\nto not only talk about the\nguys, and not have the\nbanter be too laddish \u2013 I\ncan be susceptible to\nthat sometimes, but it\u2019s\nabout making sure the\ngirls included and there\u2019s\nenough girls playing to\nmake them want to keep\ncoming and playing.\nNastya: What\u2019s the\ngoalie situation?\nSasha: We usually have\nAlex, who used to be a\ngoalie for St Andrews\nwomen\u2019s team or Joe,\nwho is the men\u2019s BUCS\ngoalie.\nTom: Ahaha, the goalie\nsituation. It\u2019s as if I can\nfind a goalie. There are\nno LUSL 2s goalies, so I\nusually steal some from\ntheotherteams,depending\non who\u2019s around. There\u2019s\nloads of good goalies in\nthe club, but not LUSL 2s\ngoalies. Have I considered\ntraining one up? I mean,\nit\u2019s always hard to \u201csacrifice\u201d a fresher, as they\nwant the glory of having\nscored the goals, playing\noutfield, and it\u2019s hard\nto convince a fresher to\nstay in goal. Maybe next\nyear, but unfortunately,\nmy time as captain will\nbe coming to an end, so,\nthat next year\u2019s problem.\nAlso, Giovanni, if you\u2019re\nreading this, you twat, you\nwere supposed to be the\none that\u2019s coming to play\nour goalie.\nNastya: What\u2019s the\nrelationship between\nLUSL 1s, 2s and the\nBUCS teams?\nSasha: We\u2019re all good\nfriends I think. Being\ncaptain this year has made\nme more vocal in BUCS\ngames and has given me\nmore authority. I don\u2019t\npersonally have a preference between LUSL 1s\nand BUCS teams.\nTom: You know like if\nyou had a little brother,\nand you love them dearly,\nbut if they do anything\nbetter than you, you start\nfeeling sick and you have\nto be better than them at\nall cost. That\u2019s kind of\nthe relationship between\nthe 1s and 2s, with the 2s\nbeing the little brother,\nwho gets all the love and\nattention and has all the\nbest shit chat and who is\nactually quite good and\nmakes the 1s scared. It\u2019s\nwhat happens when we\nplayed the 1sts last week,\nthey started out letting\nus score some goals and\nbeing all nice and lovey-dovey, then the LUSL 2s\nscared them and they got\nquite aggressive. LUSL\n1s have to make sure they\nwin, otherwise they\u2019re\ngoing to have a massive\nfit \u2013 don\u2019t tell Sasha I said\nthat. As for the BUCS\nteams, the BUCS girls\nalways get my girls to play\nfor them, so they\u2019re really\nclose, but the BUCS boys\nare generally a bit more\nladdish compared to us.\nBUCS guys and LUSL 2s\ndon\u2019t mix too much, but\nin goal, I was trying to\npass him the ball, but since\nthey insisted on playing\nusing a size 4 ball, it just\nskimmed under his arm\ninto the net. We still have\nfour games to play and\nBarts away is usually the\nbest game of the season.\nSasha scored ucl\u2019s only\ngoal into joe by backhand\n\u2013 ball skimmed under arm\ninto the net\nTom: Hussein getting\na match twat award for\nevery match of the season\nso far. Match twat goes\nto the person who did\nthe dumbest thing during\na match. There was one\ntime when Hussein asked\nme if he can get in next, I\nsaid yes. Halfway through\nthe game he jumped in the\nwater without telling the\nguy to come out. Another\ntime when he was\nstanding in the shallow\nend in Ethos, the ref\ncalled him for jumping,\nand he was holding the\nball, looking at the ref like\n\u201cwhat do you mean I\u2019m\nstanding?\u201d Petros scored\na few amazing goals, still\nwaiting for someone to\nscore a bicy (bicycle-kick\nthe ball in the goal).\nFinlay\u2019s had a few great\nones \u2013 he\u2019s famous for his\nback shots, but he\u2019s not\ndone many this year. I\u2019ve\ngot a spreadsheet with the\ndifferent types of shots\npeople do, and he\u2019s on two\nbackshots and I\u2019m on one,\nso he needs to watch out\nfor the backshot trophy to\nbe taken by someone else.\nWill their hopes and\ndeclarations prove to be\ntrue?\nStay tuned to find out,\nor come watch the epic\nVarsity game on 28th\nFebruary, at 20.30 in the\nEthos pool!\nLookforwardtothenext\ninstallment of the Q&A\nnext week 21/02/2020...\nAnastasia\nKolesnikova\nICSWP: Women\u2019s Waterpolo\nCaptain (BUCS)\nSPORTS\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 14TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32\n\u201cat some point\nit got really\nviolent and\nthere were six\npeople all over\neach other\u201d\nthey support each other in\nand out of the pool.\nNastya: What are\nthe highlights of the\nseason?\nSasha: Finlay\u2019s back-shots have not worked\nthat well this year \u2013 he\nhit the keeper in nose in\nUCL. Oh wait, that was\nlast year. The UCL game\nwas quite messy - Simon\nthrew the ball after the\nwhistle, at some point\nit got really violent and\nthere were six people all\nover each other. None of\nthe refs knew what was\ngoing on, it was a mess.\nI scored UCL\u2019s goal into\nJoe by backhand. Joe was\n\u201cMatch twat\ngoes to\nthe person\nwho did the\ndumbest\nthing during a\nmatch\u201d\nwhoever trains gets the\nspot in a game. We\u2019ve\nmanaged to always have\n13 players per game. We\nthought that the 4th\nyears,\nwho came with previous\nexperience, should play as\nmuch as possible, so that\nthey can learn the British\nrules. We wanted to\nhave more inexperienced\nplayers to play for the\nfirsts as well, as LUSL 2s\nhave 21 players in their\nteam, but we couldn\u2019t as\nthat\u2019s strictly disallowed.\nTom: Out of the team,\nonly Petros played before.\nHenry says he was a polo\ncaptain, but we all know\nthat\u2019s a sympathy card.\nI had to recruit freshers\nwith the promise of lots\nof bad nights out and bev-\n"

    "content": "Rough for Theatre II/\nEndgame\nLoveSexIdentityAmbition\nN\never in my life\nas a theatrego-er have I felt\nso taken aback\nby a fellow audience\nmember as I did when\nwatching this double-bill\nproduction of two texts by\nthe acclaimed playwright\nSamuel Beckett. All\nthroughout the two and a\nhalf hour run, the gentleman who sat behind me\nkept bursting in enormous\nfits of laughter, erupting\nwith joy, occasionally\nwithout much accompaniment from the rest of the\naudience. Not only did\nI keep getting startled\nby his louder-than-the-actors presence, I was\nalso confused as I did not\nfind either of the plays\nfunny, or even remotely\ninteresting.\nThe performance\nstarted with Rough for\nTheatre II, a short play\noriginally written in\nFrench and translated\ninto English by Beckett\nhimself. It follows two\nmen, who might be of\nthis world or not, as\nthey discuss the life of a\nthird man who is about\nto jump out of a window\non the sixth floor of a\nbuilding somewhere. I\nknow this sounds vague,\nbut honestly, there really\nwasn\u2019t much more to it.\nNo real plot develop-ment, and no conclusion.\nHowever, my biggest\ngripe with Rough for\nTheatre II is the fact that\nit was simply tagged\nalong to the beginning of\nEndgame, without much\npurpose or any connection\nbetween the two plays.\nFollowing an interval\nalmost as long as Rough\nfor Theatre II itself came\nEndgame, which is widely\nconsidered to be one of\nBeckett\u2019s finest works.\nIt\u2019s a play where once\nagain, not much happens,\nand there\u2019s too much\ntalking. Perhaps this was\nintentional, an attempt to\nportray the monotony of\nlife, especially for those\nunder less fortunate cir-cumstances. However, as\na viewer, this was neither\nsatisfying nor entertain-ing.\nBoth plays star Alan\nCumming and Daniel\nRadcliffe, who do a commendable job carrying\nthe verbose, emotionless\nscripts through the finish\nline. The direction by\nRichard Jones is slick,\nhowever, the reliance\non physical comedy (for\nexample, Radcliffe repeatedly slapping himself)\nlooked cheap, and did not\nadd much to an already\nbleak script.\nNeedless to say, I\nleft the Old Vic grossly\nunimpressed. Given the\ncalibre of talent both on\nand off-stage, I expected\nto be entertained, if\nnothing else. Instead, all\nI could think of was how\nI\u2019d much rather be doing\nalmost anything else.\nL\noveSexIdentit-yAmbition is a\n5 day long show\nconsisting of 4\nactresses performing 16\nmonologuesfromthebook\nHear Me Now by Titilola\nDawudu and Tamasha.\nEach monologue belongs\nto one of the four catego-ries: Love, Sex, Identity,\nand Ambition, telling\nstories concerning women\nof colour.\nThe act began with\nKoko Brown, a humorous\nhost who touched on the\ntopics mentioned in the\na colorful scarf which\nbecame their main prop.\n\u2018Going to Paris\u2019 performed by Safiyya Ingar\nwas definitely a stand out\npiece. The monologue\nbrought up the topic of\nsocial inequality in a very\ncheerful and optimistic\nstyle. It compared the\nopposite attitudes between\nthe monologist and her\nsaddening to understand\nhow actions such as being\ntreated with respect were\nout of the ordinary for her.\nAfter her lengthy speech,\nthere was a heartbreaking\nand anticlimactic ending\nwhere she realised he had\nbeen asleep the whole\ntime.\n\u2018The N Word\u2019 was also\na well-acted performance\nby Chinwen Nwokolo.\nTaking place in a bar\nwhere a girl was supposed\nto go on stage to perform\na song, the monologue is\ngiven by her sister in the\naudience. Despite the performers being forbidden\nto use the N word, the\ngirl insists it is a way of\nself-expression. In order\nto avoid the girl getting\ninto trouble, her sister\ntalks to the organiser and\ndecides to perform instead\nCumming and Radcliffe in Rough for Theatre II // Manuel Harlan\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 14TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

In the\nmonologue, the girl who\nturned to stripping on\ncamera tried to convince\nher friend to also believe\nthey deserved to be where\nthey wanted to be and\nhad to fight for it. The\nacting was particularly\nimpressive since besides\nmissing the words of the\nfriend, Safiyya managed\nto make it seem as if we\nwere listening to the full\nconversation between\nthem.\nAnother outstanding\nmonologue was \u2018REKHA\u2019\nperformed by Adele Oni.\nIt portrayed an after-sex\nscene of a woman who\nhad fallen in love during\nthe previous night.

Time for shitpost\nF\nelix has a rather\nlong history.\nFounded in the\n1950s as the\nstudent newspaper, it\nhas undergone multiple\nmutations, from being\nan 8-page brochure published once a month to its\ncurrent incarnation where\nwe push a 32-48-page\nissue out the door once a\nweek. This will continue\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nto happen, whether you\nlike it or not. Felix has\na role at the heart of the\nuniversity, acting as a\ncurated forum for debate,\na place to write about your\nclub, and probably most\nimportantly, as a place to\ntest your wit against the\nfiendish puzzles editors.\nThe devil is in the detail,\nas they say, and is sometimes the solution to 6\nacross.\nHowever, Felix also\nhas a more serious role.\nIts job is to report on\nthe goings-on across\ncampus and ensure\nthat the student body\nhave some measure of\nawareness about issues\nconcerning them. This is\nimportant for a variety of\nreasons. Knowledge of\nissues allows students to\nmake informed choices\nand make up their minds\nabout whether they\nagree or disagree with\na given situation. This\ngrants them agency, an\nundervalued commodity\nin the modern capitalist\nhellscape. Knowledge\nis power, so they say.\nThis is all very well, but\npower without execution\nis pointless. Someone\nfetch my Phrygian cap.\nIn order to turn\nstudent awareness into\naction, it is necessary\nto have a tool through\nwhich action can be\ntaken. This ideally\nwould be an effective\nand decisive union.\nWe have ICU. Plagued\nby high staff turnover,\nand an apparent reality\ndisconnect between\nthe junior levels and\nupper management, ICU\nmanages to cock up a\ngreat many things, from\nsexual assault to stall\nallocation at Freshers\nFair. The only reason\nthey haven\u2019t yet been\ncriminally incompetent\nis because they have\nyet to do anything at\nall. Unfortunately, they\nhave, for a great many\nyears, been allowed to\nget away with it. I would\nattribute this to an\nattitude of apathy on the\npart of the student body.\nStudents, unless they\nare very involved with\nsociety management or\nother volunteering roles,\nare unlikely to encounter\nthe short, withered arm\nof the Union. Students\nsimply don\u2019t care about\nthe Union.\nObviously, the root\ncause of this apathy\nis ICU. People simply\naren\u2019t going to use a\nmarzipan hammer to\ndrive in a nail because it\nwould be pointless and a\nwaste of sugary almond\ngoodness. However,\nFelix must also share\na portion of the blame.\nImperial is the 6th\nmost\ninternational university\nin the world. Felix\nand, by extension, the\nUnion, should reflect\nthis. People don\u2019t use\nthings when there is a\nbarrier to entry to its\nuse. If Felix wants to be\nread and remain relevant\nto the entire Imperial\nCommunity there should\nbe at least a few issues\npublished in some of\nthe many scripts and\nlanguages that make\nImperial such a wonderful place to be. At\nleast then, people would\nknow they were using a\nnewspaper to wipe their\narse with.\nhas been demonstrated\nby the fact that through\nGreening Imperial\u2019s\nAviation Report we\nnow know the carbon\nfootprint associated\nwith travel by staff and\nPhD students at Imperial\nin 2018-19, and that\naround 15% of the total\nusers in the Egencia\ndataset (the travel management system used by\nthe college) are responsible for 50% of total\nemissions recorded.\nThere is even an option\non the procurement\nsystem called \u201cThere\nMust Be an Alternative\u201d\n(THEMBA) for staff\nto offset by investing\nin a charity supporting\nmacadamia nut farmers\nin Malawi, providing\nfood security and\ncarbon sequestration in\na country with serious\ndeforestation and food\ninsecurity linked to\nclimate change.\nOf course offsetting\nis not the only means\nof tackling the solution,\nit takes decades for\ntrees to absorb the\ncarbon equivalent to\nthe purchased amount\nwhen buying an offset.\nShifting to lower carbon\ntransport, for instance,\nwhen travelling within\nthe UK or to Europe has\nbeen made needlessly\ncomplicated by the\ncollege travel provider,\nand can be an affordable option, especially\nbecause they do not\nget tax breaks for fuel.\nStaff and students suffer\nfrom lack of finances or,\nmore usually, time, to\npurchase video-confer-encing equipment or use\nlower carbon means of\ntransport. Furthermore\nmany UK research\ncouncils are currently\nfailing to approve carbon\noffsets as expenses from\nresearch grants. This\nis a significant area for\nthe college as staff and\nstudents are regularly\nrequired to travel for\nfield work, teaching,\nand conferences. As well\nas avoiding high-car-bon travel, an internal\nbudget and a policy of\noffsetting all emissions\nby default would be an\neffective, low-cost, and\nmuch needed means for\nreducing Imperial College\u2019s carbon footprint.\nIt would be following\nthe lead of other colleges\nsuch as Fitzwilliam\nCollege, Cambridge,\nwhich already offsets\nall greenhouse gas\nemissions resulting from\ntravel associated with its\nactivities.\nAct on the social dimensions of the climate\ncrisis\nYes it is a climate\ncrisis, not a change, and\nit is affecting people\nright now, even if in\nLondon the worst we see\nare images of flooded\nhomes or burning\nforests. It is heartening\nthat, although to an\nextent removed to the\nSRI, progress is being\nmade towards acting on\nthe social dimensions\nof climate change. The\ncollege participates in\nscholarship programmes\nfor students from lower-and middle-income\ncountries, for instance\nthrough the Beacon\nScholarship. That said,\nof the 32 current Beacon\nscholarships at both\nhigh-school and university level, only one\nis to ICL, compared to\nCambridge and Bristol,\nwhich each have three\ntimes as many. In the\npast week, on Wednesday 5th\nFebruary, the\ncollege announced a\nnew partnership to train\nfuture African science\nleaders and brought\ntogether representatives from a number of\nAfrican nations. Actions\nlike these are positive,\nand a lot of hard work\ngoes into establishing\npartnerships. It is the\nright thing to do for\nuniversities like ICL to\nparticipate in partnerships with universities\nin the Global South as\nthe social capital gives\nstrength in tackling\nchallenges for low- and\nmiddle-income countries that are emerging\nfrom the climate and\necological crises. It is\nalso our duty. Imperial\nCollege was founded\nduring the time of the\nBritish empire, and the\nsurrounding area was\nbuilt up with the support\nof the ruler of an empire.\nImperialism left its mark\nin many nations in the\nGlobal South far more\ndeeply than it did on the\nidentity of this college.\nHistory aside, some of\nthe iron in our buildings\nand the elements in the\nelectronics is extracted\nin these countries,\nwhere it is available and\ncheapest, and often at a\ncost to the health of the\nworkers and to the detriment of the local en-vironment. And in bitter\nirony, metal extraction\nis one of the areas ICL\nhas investments into.\nIn 2016 for instance,\nImperial College held\njust under \u00a32 million in\n\u201cETFS Metal Securities\nAustralia Ltd\u201d which\nputs the money into\nprecious metals trading\nand exploitation through\nmining with its associated by-products.\nThe decision of the\nSRI working group is to\nbe announced on Friday\n14th\nFebruary, the day\nthis article goes to print.\nIt has been long antici-pated. Will the college\ncontinue pouring money\ninto environmentally\nand socially damaging\ncompanies, or will it\nlisten to the demands of\nits staff and students?\nI am hopeful that the\ncollege will make use\nof the momentum and\nbe part of the change for\nthe sake of the planet.\nTime is running out.\nThe open letter from\nExtinction Rebellion\nsent to the College is\navailable on Twitter\n@XR_Imperial and\nFacebook \u201cExtinction Rebellion Imperial\nCollege\u201d\n\u201cFitzwilliam\nCollege, Cambridge already\noffsets all\nemissions resulting from\ntravel\u201d\n\n"

As recent political events have shown,\na national identity may\novertake a continental\nEuropean one. One of\nthe biggest challenges\nthat the RCSU faces is\nto bridge 3000 students\nfrom Maths, Physics,\nChemistry, Biochemistry\nand Biology together as a\nsingle entity beyond their\ndepartmental level. One\nway of promoting this is\nthrough the social, sport,\nand RAG organisation of\nlarge interdepartmental\nevents. It is, however,\nimportant to bear in mind\nthat we wish to achieve\nthis by working alongside the departmental\nsocieties and without\nevent cross-interference.\nThus, event logistics\n(dates, times, location\nand types of event) and\npublicity methods need to\nbe carefully planned out,\novercoming a number of\nhurdles. Our successes\nand failures provide the\nopportunity to develop as\nthe Activities Committee\nas well as re\ufb02ecting on\nwhy it is we volunteer.\nIn the RCSU one of our\nfundamental aims, especially within the activities\nteam, is to create events\nbringing you wonderful\npeople and your wonderful cultures together. At\nImperial we celebrate our\ndifferences, and we wish\nto re\ufb02ect that in the events\nwe provide. As evidently\nas within people, the\nmore distinctive and more\nplentiful the activities the\nmore joyous the fruits of\ninteraction and participa-tion.\nFoodie lover RAG\nof\ufb01cer Karl Lee shares\nhis RCSU success guide\nthrough a beautiful and\nstomach-teasing analogy\nwhere events are the key\ndriving force (on top of\ndedication, motivation\nand teamwork of course!):\n\u201cI recently visited the\nUnion Bar to test out\nthe refreshed edition of\nImperial College Cheesy\nCurly Fries. I breathed\nheavily as I clutched the\nwarm box of fries, eager to\ntaste the greasy goodness\nwithin. Opening the box,\nI separated a chunk of\ncheesy potato and lifted\nit into my mouth. The air\nwas tense. My taste buds\nerupted in a violent hurricane of sensations: salty,\nfatty, crispy, soft \u2013 all\ncombined so ingeniously\ntogether in a torrent of\ntastiness.\nI think of the RCSU just\nas I think of those cheesy\ncurly fries.Asticky but delicious mess, reminiscent\nof that complex matrix of\npotatoes, oil, and melted\ncheese. Individually, each\nbit of the RCSU is not particularly strong, just as an\nindividual potato fry is not\nparticularly noticeable or\n\ufb02avourful. Yet as a whole,\nit is a powerfully delicious\nforce; a union between a\ndiverse range of students.\nThe slew of RCSU events\nand activities; pub-crawls, quizzes, charity\nevents, nights-out \u2013 this\nis the thick, cheesy glue\nthat brings departments\ntogether. Broadsheet,\nthe Science Challenge,\nBAHfest, and many other\ninitiatives that make the\nRCSU different - these are\nthe jagged, crusty edges, a\nmix of melted cheese and\nburnt potato.

Throughout my\ndegree, I have found that\nrepresenting your \ufb01eld\nand trying to prove your\nsuperiority over the others\nis a strong incentive for\nparticipation. However,\nevents must be organised\nso that the competitive\nnature is utilised in\na friendly manner as\nfaculty cohesion must be\npromoted over further\nenhancing the divisions.\nCreating events to \ufb01t\nthese criteria has proven\nto be dif\ufb01cult, particularly\nwhen implementing them\non the large faculty-wide\nscale\u201d.\nAll in all, the success-fulness of any student led\norganisation should rely\non ef\ufb01cient teamwork\nand communication to\nlead and promote diverse\nevents. It is as a team\nthat we celebrate our\nsuccesses, as a team that\nwe confront the bumps\nalong the road and as a\nteam that we give back\nto the Imperial Community.

    "content": "En garde: Strong performances for Fencing\nF\nor the first time\nsince 2014,\nImperial Men\u2019s\n1st has conquered the BUCS South\nPremiership! This follows\na weekend hosted by\nUniversity of Kent, where\nmatches were played in\na round-robin format.\nArriving with 6/6 victories\nfrom previous matches,\nUniversity of Oxford was\nthe main rival, with losses\nonly against Imperial and\nUCL. At least 3 victories\non Imperial\u2019s side were\nrequired to secure the title.\nThe first day featured\nmatches against UCL and\nBristol. The match against\nUCL was won comforta-bly, with a lead of 45-25\nafter fencing \u00e9p\u00e9e, and\nwith sabre won with the\nscores 45-16 (with Ian\nRen scoring an impressive\nindicator of +14, of +15\npossible). The final result\nwas 129-85. In the following match against Bristol,\nthe \u00e9p\u00e9e team once again\nfenced for a comfortable\nlead of 45-21, with three\nbouts passing without\nBristol scoring a single hit\n(despite the possibility of\ndouble hits in \u00e9p\u00e9e). The\nfinal score was 135-98.\nWith this, a victory\nagainst King\u2019s College\nthe day after would secure\nthe title. After an even\nstart in foil, Hugo Briais\nfenced a perfect bout of\n5-0, leading to a 35-27\nlead. This was too much\nfor King\u2019s to catch up on,\nand Harry Peck scored the\nconclusive hit half-way\nthrough the last match\nin \u00e9p\u00e9e. The victory of\n135-105 against King\u2019s\nturned out to be crucial, as\nOxford ended up winning\nthe last bout 114-123,\ndespite an Imperial\nvictory of 125-114 earlier\nin December.\nThe Premiership title\nis the result of a great\nseason performed by\na hard-working and\ncommitted team. Whilst\nImperial has long had a\nstrong \u00e9p\u00e9e team, led by\nHarry Peck and James\nOdgers, a combination of\nweapon and BUCS rules\nmakes foil and sabre more\nheavily weighted when\nfinal scores are added up.\nTherefore, Hong Kong\ntop foilist Aaron Lee was\na very welcome addition\nlast year, and was elected\nTeam Captain to lead the\nteam through this season.\nThis year also saw the\naddition of UK top sabreur\nIan Ren, who has fenced\nformidably throughout\nthis year and clearly been\na contributing factor to the\nleague title.\nIn the same weekend,\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st also\nhad a strong performance,\nwinning 3/5 matches. The\n\u00e9p\u00e9e team was particularly\nsuccessful against UCL,\nwith the score 45-11.\nAnother very impressive\nperformance was done\nby Francesca Cavallo,\nwho - despite primarily\nbeing an \u00e9p\u00e9eist - stepped\nup in foil against Kent and\nreduced a total disadvantage of 87-101 to 97-105.\nThis was enough for the\nteam to eventually win\nwith the scores 121-116,\nwith Francesca once\nagain dominating in the\ndecisive bout. The team\nwas less lucky against\nBristol, where an initial\ndisadvantage of 17-45\nafter foil was caught up to\n102-106 before the final\n\u00e9p\u00e9e bout, which had to\nbe won by at least 5-1.\nUnfortunately, the match\nwas narrowly lost with the\nscores 107-109. Overall,\nthe Imperial Women\u2019s 1st\nplaced themselves #4/6 in\nthe league, securing their\nposition in the Premiership for the forthcoming\nseason.\nSPORTS\nFilip Ani\u00e9s\nIC Fencing: Vice President\nMen\u2019s 1st\nteam post-league victory // Basia Banaszak\nISSUE 1743\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nICSWP: LUSL 2s triumph against Barts 2s\nO\nn a cold winter\u2019s night\nin February\nthe London\nUniversities Sport\nLeagues (LUSL) 2nd\nteam, a team of elite and\nhigh-performance athletes\narrive in the dwelling of\nShadwell.

With one-min-ute left to go the ball falls\ninto the hands of acting\ngoalie El Capitan.
