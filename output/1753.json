The devil comes along and makes\nadeal,inexchangeforanotherdaytolive,hemakesone\nthingdisappearfromtheworld.Thisisthepremisethat\nsets the scene for If Cats Disappeared from the World\nby Genki Kawamura (translated by Eric Salland). The\nnarrator, faced with the peculiar and difficult decisions\nof life and death, embarks on a journey of reflection\nand reconciliation.\nThe premise is nothing special; it takes the what ifs\nthat everyone has wondered about at least for once in\ntheir lives and builds a story out of it. The choice of\npresenting the \u201cdecision-maker\u201d as character of a devil\nbetting with God is surely interesting. Kawamura even\ngoes so far of structuring the books in \u201cdays of disappearances,\u201d echoing the classic Christian reference of\nseven days of creation. Each day reveals more about the\nprotagonist and weaves into the next day smoothly; although the plot moves rather slowly at first, the complete picture comes together eventually, and it ends at\nthe perfect place.\nThe book touches on many themes in its short\nspan, each of which is profound on its own but together creating\nsomewhat of a\nmessy read\u2014\njust when I was\nhooked and\nwanted to read\nmore about\nsomething, the\nauthor swiftly\nmoves on to the\nnext. Nevertheless, the book\u2019s\ndepiction of\nfamily relationships and the\nnarrator\u2019s contemplation of\nlife and death\nstood out to me. The narrator\u2019s will to live, juxtaposed\nwith his inevitable death prompts one to reflect on the\ncentury-old questions of why we live and what are the\nmost important things in life. You see the ending com-ing, but you get to experience the narrator\u2019s emotions\nfirsthand as he walks down memory lane. It is an emotional roller coaster, but it leaves me feeling satisfied\nwhen he attempts to reconcile with his past leaving no\nregrets.\nThree thieves accidentally come across an abandoned general store with a mailbox which contained simple letters from the past, dropping in asking\nfor advice, and there began the story of this magical\nstore. The Miracles of the Namiya General Store by\nKeigo Higashino (translated by Sam Bett) covers a lot\nmore than what can be written here. Such a story is\nnot what I would ever expect from Higashino, a powerhouse of thrillers and crime fictions, including some\nof my personal favorites The Devotion of Suspect X\nand Malice. It reminds me of how Stephen King could\nwrite a story as hopeful as \u201cRita Hayworth and the\nShawshank Redemption\u201d but also a tale\nas dark as \u201cApt Pupil\u201d within the same\ncollection of short stories.\nThe storytelling is both unique and bril-liant. Higashino\u2019s background proves to\nbe very useful in crafting the suspense\nportion of the book. His whimsical writing style fits the magical realism genre\nand makes for a very pleasant reading\nexperience, which is especially needed\nsince we jump between different time-lines. The plot is almost as good as its\nstorytelling. All the characters are beautifully fleshed out and every detail comes\ntogether to weave an unexpected, heartwarming story. The book ultimately is\nabout redemption, kindness, empathy,\nand how our words and actions can influence others; it is a worthy message and what makes\nthe story so touching.

He says he\nwants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been\npublished. The President also aims to\nlower drug prices by\nallowing imports\nof cheaper ones\nPresident Trump has pledged to\ncreate 10 million jobs in 10 months,\nand create one million new small\nbusinesses. Mr Trump also promises\nto build on the tax cuts he introduced\nin his first term, including tax cuts\nand credits to entice companies to\nkeep jobs in the US rather than over-seas. Mr Trump said he will \u201cenact\nfair trade deals that protect American\njobs\u201d,buthardlymentionshowhesees\nhis trade war with China progressing.\nMr Biden, on the other hand,\nsupports the universal ban on\nfracking, says he is committed\nto a ban on \u201cfracking on federal\nland.\u201d He plans on taking steps to\nconfront environmental racism,\nand to protect people, especially\nin minority communities, who\n\u201clive near chemical plants and refineries that pollute.\u201d Mr Biden\nhas laid out an ambitious climate\nplan which includes overhauling the country\u2019s energy industry\nto achieve 100 per cent emis-sions-free power by 2035. The\nplan includes a pledge to invest $2\ntrillion in clean-energy infrastructure if Mr Biden wins the White\nHouse in November, along with a\npromise to build 1.5 million new\nenergy-efficient homes and social\nhousing units. In a nod to liberal\nvoters, who have been somewhat\nunenthusiastic about Mr Biden\u2019s\ncandidacy, the Democrat said\nthe expansive climate plan will be\nfunded by a mix of government\nfunding and increasing the corporate income tax rate from 21 to\n28 per cent to ask \u201cthe wealthiest\nAmericans to pay their fair share\u201d.\nAlthough, he has shied away from\nmentioning a ban on fossil fuels\nsuch as oil, coal and gas -a politically sensitive\ntopic in battleground\nstates like Pennsylvania and Michigan\n- instead, focusing\non incentives for car\nmanufacturers to produce zero-emission\nelectric ve-hicles.\nMr Biden wants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the\neligibility age for Medicare, the policy\nwhich provides medical benefits to the\nelderly,from65to60.Healsowishesto\nprovide all Americans with the option\nto enrol in a public health insurance\nplan similar to Medicare.\nMr Biden says he will raise taxes on\nthe wealthiest Americans, which he defines as those with an income of more\nthan $400,000 per year (the top 1-2 per\ncent). He wants to impose a marginal\ntax rate increase \u2013 so the more a worker\nearns over that threshold, the more tax\nthey must pay. He supports raising the\nfederal minimum wage to $15 (\u00a311.50)\nan hour from the current rate of $7.25\n(\u00a35.50).\nDonald Trump v/s Joe Biden 2020 Key Policies:\nArgumentativeIndian\nlalalaletstalkaboutit@gmail.com\nMaking America Again\nClimate Change Healthcare\nMR TRUMP TO\nMR BIDEN\nWE ARE ENERGY\nINDEPENDENT.\nI KNOW MORE\nABOUT WIND\nTHAN YOU DO.\n\u201c\nMR BIDEN\nI THINK HEALTH\nCARE IS NOT A\nPRIVILEGE, IT\u2019S A\nRIGHT\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Flickr\nEconomy\n\n"

    "content": "The Texas Chainsaw\nMassacre blurs the\nlines between a cinematic\nexperience and an assault.\nIt\u2019s like watching a balloon that\u2019s on the verge of\npopping, being inflated\nmore and more\u2014and\nwhenever they do release\nsome air, a second later\nthey\u2019re blowing it up\nagain but at twice the\nprevious rate. This unrelenting tension makes for one\nof the most powerful cinematic experiences you\u2019re\nlikely to have. It doesn\u2019t have a great plot; the visuals\nare adequate; the dialogue is average; and the performances are forgettable; but the film, for whatever\nreason, is not. There are very few movies that can be\nexcused in this way, and I hold it in a class of its own\nin this regard.\n\u201cDo you enjoy The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?\u201d is\na bit like asking someone whether they enjoy getting\npunched in the face. The answer is no, but at the\nsame time, the specific exhilaration you get is wholly\nconfined to that experience, and, in that, there\u2019s a\nunique thrill. This is, of course, the essence of horror:\nvolunteering to be terrified and tricked, all for the exhilaration of the experience. I see Texas Chainsaw on\na par with The Shining in its ability to lull you into its\nworld, and then gun for you relentlessly. Although\nthe all-out brutality of Texas Chainsaw is in stark\ncontrast to the symphonic composition of The Shining, it is no less terrifying. Within the savagery and\nthe whistle-stop pace, director Tobe Hooper reaches\nthe pinnacle of artistry in horror: capturing the essence of fear, then letting it loose on the audience.\nWhat I love most about this movie is its unapolo-getic tone: it is unashamedly simple and absolutely\nfearless, not once does it try to please the audience\nor attempt to get them on their side. As it becomes\nmore twisted and more horrifying, it shrugs off any\nobligations it has to the audience and says bluntly:\n\u2018Deal with it...it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse in 5\nminutes\u2019. Nothing is ever explained, but once the ride\nbegins, you very quickly lose the urge to ask ques-tions.\nHalloween Pick: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\nBorat Returns + Rebecca Remade\nReviews\nIn this new\nAmerican ad-venture, Borat\nreturns to the\nStates looking\nto make amends.\nAfter some years\ninterned in a\nKazakh labour\ncamp\u2014due to\nthe displeasure\nthe Kazakh authorities had for\nthe first movie\u2014he is sent to\nAmerica to deliver gifts to the elite. His only daugh-ter, Tutar (played by Maria Bakalova), tags along\nfor the journey, finding it hard to unite the ludicrous doctrines of her father with the liberal values\nof the USA.\nNow, to be upfront, I\u2019ve never been much of a\nfan of the original movie or of the character of Borat himself; however, I recognise that many people\ndo love him. With that said, I think the two most\nimportant questions are: 1.) did I think it was fun-ny? and 2.) was it as scathing a satire as was adver-tised? Firstly, I didn\u2019t find it particularly funny, or\nat least not any funnier than the first movie. The\njoke writing in Borat II (as I\u2019ll call it) is mainly focussed on shocking you, interspersed with nostalgic\ncatchphrases and familiar Borat beliefs. For me, the\njokes seemed desiccated and thoroughly squeezed\nof their goodness; whatever humour was bound up\nin them originally has long-since fled. What I did\nlike about Borat I was that Cohen made the objects\nof his satire stick out more than his own ridiculous\ncharacter in many ways; Borat was merely the spark\nto ignite reactions that, while seemingly normal in a\nroom next to Borat, had some sting when they were\nconsidered in isolation. For me, Borat II didn\u2019t have\nthe bite or the wit I wanted (given its political tar-gets), and I very much doubt that it will be the cultural nuke that Cohen anticipates it to be heading\nin to November 3rd.\nTo revisit something that has been done before\nis perhaps more difficult than producing something new. In such an endeavour, you begin in the\nshadow of previous work, rather than casting your\nown shadow over the genre. It is not all doom and\ngloom though, and there are two main ways in which\ndirectors can \u2018succeed\u2019 in remaking a movie: one can\ndo what the original did but even better, or one can\nmake sufficiently\nmany alterations\nthat it takes on a\naltogether different look. If a director pursues the\nsecond approach,\nthen in the eventuality that the\nnew version is\nnot as good as the\noriginal, it will,\nat least, be notably distinct from\nit. So stands Ben\nWheatley\u2019s new adaptation of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s\nnovel alongside Hitchcock\u2019s 1940 version. Firstly,\nWheatley\u2019s version is predictably worse than Hitchcock\u2019s\u2014to back this up I can only really advise you\nto watch both. What is of more interest is whether\nWheatley makes his Rebecca distinct, whether he\nsucceeds in creating something true to the book\nbut unique from the Hitchcock. I\u2019m not entirely\nconvinced he does. The film is remarkably void of\nremarkable features. Almost every aspect is...fine.\nThe cinematography adequately captures the grandeur and mystique of Manderley, the script adequately captures the early love in Monte Carlo and\nthe consequent jealousy stirred up at the estate, and\nthe performances by Lily James, Armie Hammer,\nand Kristin Scott Thomas are similarly adequate,\ndoing little to get the heart racing. If you really\nwant to watch Rebecca, I advise you to stick with the\n\u2018Master of Suspense\u2019.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nDirectedby:Tobe Hooper\nYearofRelease: 1974\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n20\nBorat Subsequent MovieFilm\nDirectedby: Jason Woliner\nStarring: Sacha Baron Cohen; Maria Bakalova\nStudio: Amazon Studios; Four by Two Films; Oak\nSprings Productions\nRebecca\nDirectedby: Ben Wheatley\nStarring: Lily James; Armie Hammer; Kristin Scott\nThomas\nStudio: Working Title Films\nCredits: Amazon Studios\nCredits: Netflix\n\n"

Mr Trump did not call\nfor social distancing or the use of facial\ncoverings, despite evidence that such\nmeasures reduce the spread of the\ndisease. He made misleading claims\nabout the speed with which a vaccine would be available to the public\nbut offered a less optimistic timeline\nwhen pressed by the moderator, Kristen Welker of NBC News.\nPresident Trump, after continuously stoking the fires of white su-premacy, , has promised to address\nthe growing racial unrest by ensuring\nto \u201cdefend\u201d America\u2019s police forces in the wake of growing protests\nagainst instances of police brutality towards African-Americans. Mr\nTrump says he doesn\u2019t believe racism\nis a systemic problem within US police forces, and his campaign promises to protect police funding and hire\nmore officers, increase punishments\nfor attacks on police, and take action\nagainst political protest movements.\nThe law and order promises also include tough action on illegal immigration and stronger requirements\nfor legal immigrants.\nMr Biden wants to set up a national contact-tracing programme,\nestablish at least 10 testing centres\nin every state, and provide free\ncoronavirus testing to all. He supports a nationwide mask mandate,\nwhich would require face cover-ingstobewornonfederalprop-erty.\nMrBidencallsforbroaderaccess to education, health care and\nwealth for those who have been\ndenied the opportunity. He also\nadvocates for rehabilitation rather than jail for people convicted\nof drug-related offences and emphasises the need to get rid of\nmandatory minimum prison sen-tences.\nCoronavirus\nCriminal and Racial Justice\n\u201cMost of the globe will breathe a sigh of relief if Biden is elected,\u201d said Stubb, now director of the varsity of Transnational\nGovernance, at the ECU University Institute in Florence. \u201cBut I\nbelieve we must always all be realistic and understand that we\u2019re\nnot going back to the supposed good old days \u2014 either way, I do\nnot think American power will return to what it had been.\u201d\nThe entire world is watching the Presidential Race and is trying to figure out what the result will mean for them, every U.S.\npresidentialelectionhasswayoninternationalaffairs;thewinner\ndespite everything becomes the leader of the world\u2019s largest economic and military power. For some, President Donald Trump\nhas ushered in a very new style of politics that they fully support.\nFor others, a Joe Biden victory would be warmly welcomed.\nIn Europe particularly, Trump is extremely unpopular in most\ncountries. Countries like the Asian nation, China and Asian\ncountries could find that a Biden victory would mean closer\nscrutiny of their human rights records and military actions. The\nUS Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security\nCenter last month warned foreign states were using \u201ccovert and\novert influence measures\u201d to sway the vote in their favour. His\nstatement asserted that Russia wants to damage Joe Biden. But\nit also claims China doesn\u2019t want Donald Trump returned to\npower. Beijing, he says, \u201cprefers that President Trump \u2013 whom\nBeijing sees as unpredictable \u2013 does not win re-election\u201d, and has\nbeen \u201cexpanding its influence efforts\u201d ahead of the November\nvote. Meanwhile, Russia has been attempting to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Bidenwhile\u201cseekingtoboostPresidentTrump\u2019scandidacyonsocial\nmedia\u201d. In Iran, many are probably hoping for a Biden victory, a\nbrand new nuclear deal and relief from the crippling sanctions\nthat Trump introduced.\nThis really is the most important election in US History. The\ndifference between a second Trump term and the election of\nBiden will have enormous consequences, especially for Washington\u2019s involvement in the world.

It follows Emily, a girl in her\nmid-twenties working as a marketing strategist from\nChicago, who accepts a job in Paris despite her not\nknowingawordofFrench.Thispremisealreadymakes\nfor an unfortunate start for both Emily and the show.\nThe show\u2019s plot can be best summarized as Emily trying juggle her new job, friendship, and romantic relationships as she struggles to adjust to the new culture.\nI did not have high hopes to begin with\u2014all I\nwanted was a simple, undemanding show\u2014an eye\ncandy, per se. A show with a young protagonist starting a new chapter of life in a new city seems like the\nperfect story\u2014fun and motivational, the exact kind\nof show to keep me in the mood to start another semester of university. Besides, Lily Collins is a lovely\nactress, with a likeable personality that fits the aura\nof a character like Emily. Not to mention how Paris\u2019s\nbeauty and charm makes the perfect backdrop for a\nplot like this.\nBut that about sums up all the ups of Emily in Paris\u2014Lily Collins and Paris itself.\nThe major flaw of the show is the weak plot. There\nis little to no character development; the Emily from\nthe first episode is identical to Emily in the last epi-sode. Any conflict that arises always magically solves\nitself. Emily doesn\u2019t speak French? Everyone she\nmeets speaks perfect English then. Emily doesn\u2019t\nhave friends in Paris? She just randomly meets the\nfriendliest people on the streets and instantly becomes best friends with them. Emily gets fired?\nThere is no such thing as firing people in Paris. Emily\nbreaks up with her boyfriend in Chicago? She has one\nencounter with a hot guy after another in Paris, oh,\nand they all speak perfect English as well.\nI get that TV shows are bound to have coincidences and conveniences here and there,\nbut this is way beyond what should\nbe acceptable. I love rom-coms\nand fairytales and perfect endings\ntoo, but the plot is outright superficial and frivolous. At the very\nleast, Emily could have had a Devil Wears Prada moment like when\nAndy reflects on herself, buckles\nup, and impresses Miranda. But\nthe lazy writing of the show rushes the plot, skips any\nbuild-up, and oversimplifies everything. It makes the\nshow frustrating to watch and does not do justice to\nthe character of Emily either.\nEven an actress as charming as Lily Collins cannot\nmake the character of Emily works because this character is written so poorly. Emily is a character with a\nlot of potential, but we do not really\nget to see Emily go beyond the image of a basic white American girl.\nWhat Emily\u2019s boss Sylvie (played by\nPhilippine Leroy-Beaulieu) sums up\nthe problem pretty well, \u201cYou come\nto Paris. You walk into my office.\nYou don\u2019t even bother to learn the\nlanguage. You treat the city like it\u2019s\nyour amusement park. And after a\nyear of food, sex, wine and maybe some culture, you\u2019ll\ngo back to where you came from.\u201d\nEmily in Paris is riddled with countless extreme\nFrench clich\u00e9s. It is almost as if the writers refuse\nto take Paris as a true city and instead grab all the\nstereotypes they can think of and dump them all\ninto the script, from workplace extramarital affairs\nto chain smoking to mean Parisians, a lot of which\nare untrue. The writers do not stop at France when it\ncomes to stereotypes; Emily holds a lot of American\nstereotypes as well (although I am not sure if it is just\npoor character writing or piling up stereotypes or\nboth). Emily\u2019s newfound best friend in Paris, Mindy\nChen (played by Ashley Park), a rich Chinese girl\nwho runs away from her rich family, is yet another\ninaccurately written character written from typical\nAsian impressions.\nAll in all, I would say that this is a hate-watch,\ncringe-binge type of show that prompts an inexplicable urge to keep watching despite much to dislike.\nEmily in Paris\nReviewed by Jia Qi Tan Television Editor\nStarring: Lily Collins, Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo\nEpisodes: 10 (30 minutes)\nCredits courtesy of Netflix\nLily Collins as Emily\nCredits courtesy of Fox Pictures\nAndy (Anne Hathaway) in The Devil Wears Prada\n\u201c\nA HATE-WATCH,\nCRINGE-BINGE\nTYPE OF SHOW\n\n"

The\nrace for the White House has begun in\nearnest, and while the world waits for\nthe results, it\u2019s essential to understand\nthe mechanism behind the voting pro-cess.\nAmerica at the ballot:\nAmericans don\u2019t directly vote for the\nPresidential candidates, instead, they\nvote for people called \u201celectors\u201d in their\nstate who are supporting the candidate\nthey wish to become President - this \u2018assemblage\u2019 is known as the electoral col-lege. The electoral college was created\nby the Founding Fathers\nin the year 1787; it was\na compromise between\nelecting the president\nby a vote in Congress\nor electing through a\npopular vote by qualified citizens. The college came into existence\nbecause the delegates\nwanted to balance the\ninterests of high-pop-ulation & low-popu-lation states, they also\nbelieved that not all\nvoters would be educated enough to cast a vote\nso the electoral college\nwould act as a buffer between the people\nand electing the president.\nThe more people that live in a state,\nthe more electors there are. Presently,\nthere are 538 electors in total, made up\nof 435 Representatives (Congressmen\n& Congresswomen) and 100 Senators,\nplus the three additional electors from\nthe District of Columbia. Each state is\nallowed a minimum of three electoral votes, and Washington DC also gets\nthree-body votes, forming a total of 538\nelectors. The candidate with the most\nnumber of electors wins all the state\u2019s\nbody votes and also the first candidate to\nwin enough states and to get to 270 electoral votes is elected into the office. California, considered to be the most crucial\nstate, has 55 electoral votes, while Texas,\nthe next largest, gets 38 electoral votes.\nNew York and Florida get 29 votes each.\nAllbuttwostates\u2013MaineandNebraska\n\u2013 use a winner-takes-all system (\u201cWinner takes all\u201d means all Electoral College\nvotes will go to one candidate based on\nthe State\u2019s popular vote), so if someone\nwins the foremost votes during a state,\nthey take its entire haul of body votes.\nTo be elected President, either candidate must win a majority of the 538 electors - i.e. 270 electors. The body system\ndoes usually reflect the popular vote (the\npopular vote is simply which candidate\nhas received the\nmost total votes)\n\u2013 Presidents have\nwon the electoral\nvote while losing\nthe popular vote.\nA recent instance\nwas in 2016 when\nDonald Trump\nwon the body and\nwas elected President, even though\nHillary Clinton,\nhis Democratic\nopponent, won\nthe popular vote.\nThe casting of a\nvote for the Presidential Election may be a simple choice\nbetween candidates from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party,\nalthough, occasionally a 3rd party candidate throws their name in the hat, like\nKanye West this year, it\u2019s quite rare for\nthem to get any traction or make some\nmajor impact.\nSo when Americans will cast their\nvote on November\n3rd, they would\ntechnically be voting for \u201celectors\u201d,\nnot directly for the\nPresidential Candidates themselves.\nEach elector then\ncasts one vote following the final\nelection for one of\nthe two candidates\n(here, Trump and\nBiden). The newly\nelected president\nand vice-president\nare said to be inaugurated on January\n20, 2021, although\nthe date isn\u2019t set in\nstone, given the fact\nthat a significant\nnumber of people\nhave mailed-in their\nvotes, so counting\n& results would be\ndone a little differ-ently, owing to the\npandemic.\nThe key for either party to win the\nPresidential Election is by focusing on\nthe specific swing states, also known as\nthe battleground or purple states. Swing\nstates can shift between each election\ncycle, and they are often determined\nby analysing past results, opinion polls,\npolitical trends and any strengths or\nweaknesses of the candidates involved,\nand their policies. These states have unclear party loyalties and have historically\nswung between voting for Republican\nand Democrat candidates in past elec-tions. This year North Carolina, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona\ncould all be decisive within the election\u2019s\noutcome. They\u2019re all states in which Mr\nTrump narrowly won against Hillary\nClinton in 2016, helping him secure his\nPresidency. Retaining them is crucial to\nhis re-election hopes. If the polls are to\nbetrusted,MrBidenholdsacompetitive\nedgeoverMrTrumpaltogether.Pollsters\nattributed Mr Biden\u2019s result in support\namongwhiteuniversity-educatedvoters,\nwhile Mr Trump\u2019s support among white\nworking-class voters is waning. Currently, the 10-poll average indicates that just\nover 1/2 Americans will back Mr Biden\nwhile Mr Trump\u2019s support trails this by\naround five or six points.\nTime to take out the rubbish\nMaking America Again\nArgumentativeIndian\nlalalaletstalkaboutit@gmail.com\nTHE KEY FOR\nEITHER PARTY\nTO WIN THE\nPRESEIDENTIAL\nELECTION IS BY\nFOCUSING ON\nTHE SPECIFIC\nSWING STATES\n\u201c\nIllustration credits: Lisha Zhong, MRes Bioengineering\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n6\nFollowing days of mysterious whispers of an \u201cexciting new discovery\nabout the Moon\u201d, NASA finally let us in\non their secret on Thursday. It was announced via the NASA TV live stream\nthat two separate studies, both published by Nature Astronomy, had discovered water on the moon, including\non the sunlit lunar surface.\nThe two studies were conducted using\ndata from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been in orbit\naround the moon since 2009, and the\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared\nAstronomy (SOFIA), a converted Boeing-747 which carries a 2.7 metre telescope and is able to fly above 99% of\nthe water vapour in the Earth\u2019s at-mosphere.\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter took photos and\ntemperature measurements of the dark, cold\nside of the moon. Previous studies have\nfound evidence for\n\u201ccold traps\u201d of ice on this part of the\nmoon, but these were thought to be restricted to deep, wide craters. The new\nresearch suggests that there are also \u201cmicro-cold traps\u201d, which are smaller areas that are permanently shadowed and\ncould therefore contain more easily accessible ice.\nUsing infrared astronomy, SOFIA\ndetected water molecules in the Clavius\nCrater, one of the moon\u2019s largest craters\nwhich is visible from Earth. Previous\nresearch had shown that hydrogen was\npresent in these craters, but\nscientists had\nnot been\nable to rule out the possibility that this\nwas due to the presence of hydroxyl\n(-OH) rather than water (H20). The\ninfrared spectra produced by SOFIA\nnow give definitive evidence that water\nis present - but it is unclear how exactly this water is protected from the harsh\nlunar environment. The researchers have\nsuggested that it could be stored between grains on the surface, or in bubbles of \u201clunar glass\u201d to protect it.\nThe discovery of water on the sunlit\nsurface is significant for several reasons.\nWhile scientists were previously\naware of the presence of\nsome water on\nthe moon,\nthese\nnew studies suggest that it is much more\nabundant than previously thought. They\nalso show that the distribution of water\nacross the lunar surface is not limited to\ncold, shadowy places, which may make\nit more accessible for extraction. This\ncould make it possible to establish a sustainable human presence on the moon,\nwith water available both for sustaining\nlife and for refuelling aircraft. It would\nbe far cheaper to make rocket fuel on the\nMoon than to transport it from Earth,\nso the Moon could potentially become a\ngas station for travellers to deeper outer\nspace.\nThis week\u2019s announcement could\ntherefore be very significant for NASA\u2019s\nArtemis Programme, which aims to send\nthe first woman and next man to the\nmoon by 2024, and to create a \u201cgateway\u201d\nin orbit on the moon to allow for easier\ntravel to Mars. However, more work\nremains to establish whether the\nwater that has been discovered\nwill be sufficient for sustaining\nor supporting a human lunar\npresence.\nNASA announces discovery of water\non the Moon\u2019s sunlit surface\nLily Shepherd Science Editor\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia\nlix interview. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a friend who\nis offering pro bono services...

But it\u2019s very hard\nfor the whole University Press Office to\nmanage the volume of requests, since it\u2019s\na lot of work.\u201d\nHowever, this seems to contradict\nwhat the University of Oxford Press\nOffice said on this matter to the Byline\nTimes back in March: \u201cAll Oxford academics have freedom of expression regarding their areas of specialism, including communication through the media.\nIt is therefore not uncommon for academics to make their own arrangements\nfor contacting the press.

    "content": "FRIDAY 30TH OCTOBER 2020\n19\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPeople who are constantly around me know that I\nidentify myself as a snob when it comes to music.\nI take pride in discovering artists (hello, Dua Lipa,\n*cough*) before they go big, and scold them when\nthey dismiss music I share with them only to fangirl\nover them a few months down the line when they\nbecome hits. Yeah, I\u2019m a little annoying.\nRina Sawayama, the up and coming Japanese-born\nBritish singer-songwriter, has built a rabid fanbase,\nin no small part thanks to her brilliant debut album,\nSAWAYAMA, which was released in April 2020, in\nthe height of lockdown. Although consistently growing her fanbase, which includes the\nlegendary Elton John who has gone\non record to name SAWAYAMA as\nhis favourite album of the year, she\nhas not yet reached the popularity\nthat a lot of her contemporaries have.\nHowever, I am a firm believer that\nfor Rina, the only way is up.\nSAWAYAMA doesn\u2019t quite have\nan overarching concept, however\nI think it would be a valid assessment to say that there is running social commentary\nthroughout the album. For instance, \u2018XS\u2019 (a pun for\n\u2018excess\u2019) is a faux-\u2018flex song\u2019 which criticises commer-cialism. What a Marxist anthem. I believe it would\nalso be fair to say that the most prominent themes\nthroughout the album are heritage and identity. Not\nonly do various songs heavily refer to Japan and her\nJapanese roots lyrically, they also gorgeously tie in to\nher British upbringing, resulting in deeply personal,\nhonest songwriting.\nOne of the things that makes SAWAYAMA special\nis the seamless way different genres have been blended\nwithin each individual song. Banging rock guitars\nbleed into smooth R&B beats not only from track\nto track, but within individual songs. Amazingly, no\nsong on the album ends up sounding out of place, and\nthe overall project is incredibly cohesive. Although\nRina\u2019s songwriting and delivery play an\nimportant part in making this album\nthe juggernaut it is, it is the production that truly elevates it through\ngenre-bending, mind-melting choices\nthat are in equal parts confusing and\nbrilliant.\nAlthough the album is outstanding\nthroughout, \u2018XS\u2019, \u2018STFU!\u2019 and \u2018Chosen\nFamily\u2019 are perhaps some of the more\nimmediately attention-grabbing tracks\non the album. Further, the opening and closing tracks\nof the album, \u2018Dynasty\u2019 and \u2018Snakeskin\u2019, are also nothing short of brilliant. \u2018Dynasty\u2019 is the thesis statement\nof the album, both thematically and sonically. As it\u2019s\nguitar solo kicks in, you know you are in for something special. \u2018Snakeskin\u2019 ensures that the album closes\non an energetic note following the relatively more\ntraditional (albeit beautifully penned and extremely\nheartfelt), slower paced \u2018Chosen Family\u2019. It leaves the\nlistener fully satisfied yet wanting more.\nAll in all, SAWAYAMA is a brave, borderline genius\neffort from the Cambridge graduate songstress. The\nalbum has been critically hailed as \u2018compelling\u2019 and\nRina has been labelled as \u2018one of the boldest voices in\npop today\u2019. If this record is any indication, I am firmly\nstanding my ground in my belief that the only way for\nRina is up, and she is already on her way.\nWhen did you first hear this song?\n23/09/2016 10:47am\nHow old were you when you first hear it?\n19\nHow often do you listen to the song?\nFrequency varies. I have a playlist of songs I listen to\na lot that moves with time. Now, it\u2019s pretty rare that I\nlisten to this song, but I still come back to it.\nIn a sentence, describe the song\nSmooth, a little bit bubbly, comforting, subtle, airy.\nWhat initially drew you to the song?\nI was already a fan of the artist. I really got into DnB\nfrom about 2014, I was almost exclusively listening to\nDnB but was a bigger fan of the harder stuff. So, when\nI enjoyed the liquid tracks they stood out.\nIs there a killer moment?\nThe very first part, with the one note repeating, the\nsheer clarity of the time that it brings me back to is\ninsane.\nDoes listening to this song put you in a\ncertain headspace?\nThe headspace it reminds me of is from the\nstart of second year. I had just come out of\nfirst year, one of the best years of my life, and\nnow I\u2019m free to get back to excitement and wonder of seeing my friends. That feeling of being free.\nIs there another sense you associate strongly with\nthis song?\nOvercast. A very, very cloudy sky (only because of the\nweather back then).\nHow did this song affect your musical habits?\nThis was a key liquid DnB track in my collection that\nhelped me fully appreciate the sub-genre. Lead to a\nlong time of listening to liquid.\nWhy do you love about this genre?\nIn the genre tracks usually lack vocals, allowing you to\nfocus more on what\u2019s around you. It becomes part of\nthe scene. If I listen to these songs, I can see points in\nmy past so purely, without clouding.\nFinal comments?\nTake some time to listen to music for the sake of listening to music.\nSAWAYAMA - Album of the Year?\nPassing the Aux to Gabriel Kassayie\nReviewed by Ozbil Dumenci Music Writer\nSAWAYAMA\nAlbumby: Rina Sawayama\nToptracks: XS; Chosen Family; Snakeskin\nForfansof: FKA twigs, Alanis Morisette\nRuntime: 44 mins\nAlbum Review\nFeature\nLenzman - African Dream\nInterview by Guthrie Ruby Music Editor\nGabriel - Pure Maths PhD and powerlifting legend\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 30TH OCTOBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nSCIENCE\nimmunity\u2019 is very unlikely to be achieved\nin the absence of a vaccine\u201d. This Tuesday, a study published by Imperial found\nthat antibody prevalence in the population had dropped from 6% in June to\nonly 4.4% in September. For many, this\nappearedtobeproofthatwecan\u2019trelyon\nnaturally acquired immunity to keep the\nvirus at bay.\nAccording to Gupta, however, antibody levels play a much less significant\nrole in immunity: \u201cThere is no link between the level of antibodies and protec-tion, the dynamic of antibodies is not a\ntrue reflection of how protected an individual is; it doesn\u2019t even tell you whether\nwe have a good antibody response.\u201d\nWhile most young, healthy individuals recover from COVID, cases of\n\u2018Long COVID\u2019 have been extensively\ndocumented since the\nvirus swept throughout the world. Patients\nreport crippling fa-tigue, breathlessness,\ncomplete loss of smell\nor taste, as well as an\narray of other COVID symptoms var-iations. For Gupta, who explained that\npost-viral fatigue and other symptoms\nare common after many viral infections,\n\u201cit\u2019s not unusual. And I don\u2019t see a frequency of it that makes me think this is\nsomething that we need to be seriously\nworried about\u201d. According to the COVID Symptom Study, \u2018Long COVID\u2019 has\nbeen found to affect 10% of 18-49-year\nolds.\nNeurological damage and a reduction\nin lung capacity have also been shown to\naffect individuals who had only suffered\nthe lighter COVID symptoms. Faced\nwith these challenges, Gupta remains\nclear in her stance: \u201cI think if you balance the costs of long-term COVID in a\nfew individuals against 130 million people dying of starvation, that puts a different perspective\u201d. It appears that according to Gupta, the price we would pay for\nmore rounds of lockdown is much heavier than the risk we would be taking if we\nadopt her Focused Protection approach.\nGupta also objected to the suggestion\nthat it is \u2018safe\u2019 to follow in the footsteps\nof New Zealand\u2019s successful response, responding with moral concerns over their\nborder restrictions: \u201cI don\u2019t approve of\nthat strategy because I think it\u2019s hugely\nnationalistic... [Their strategy] works if\nyou\u2019re small, but if you\u2019re a bigger nation\nwhere it\u2019s harder to do that, and where\nit\u2019s already settled in and embedded,\nit\u2019s impossible to do this... I don\u2019t think\n[their] strategy is sustainable.\u201d\nACCUSATIONS OF\nIDEOLOGICAL\nMOTIVATION\nThe choice of venue to launch the\nDeclaration was cause for concern in the\nscientific community, sprouting accusations of ideological motivation behind\nthe proposal. The scientists met at the\nAmerican Institute for Economic research (AIER), a right-wing libertarian\nthink tank that has also assisted them in\nlaunching it; a WHOIS lookup reveals\nthat AIER are the registered owner of\nthe declaration website domain name,\ngbdeclaration.\norg. They have\nsince published\narticles with titles such as \u2018The\nGreat Barrington Declaration\nIs Not Saying \u2018Lock Up Grandma\u2019\u2019, defending the statements made in the declaration against the storm of criticism\nthat it has faced.\nAIER has been strongly linked to climate change denialism - every climate\nchange report or comment that is published by the think tank downplays the\nfact that man-made climate change is a\nrisk to the planet, as well as the fact that\nclimate change is a reality at all. The organisation also has financial ties to the\nKoch brothers, right-wing libertarian\nbusinessmen considered to be some of\nthe biggest funders of popular climate\nchange denialism.\n\u201cThese are not the names one would\nassociate with sound public health policies.\u201d say public health experts and scientists Trish Greenhalgh, Martin McKee, and Michelle Kelly-Irving, in an\narticle published by the Guardian, titled\n\u2018The pursuit of herd immunity is a folly \u2013 so who\u2019s funding this bad science?\u2019.\n\u201cThe science is clear: attaining herd immunity to coronavirus via uncontrolled\ninfection is a fringe view, peddled by a\nminority with no evidence to back up\ntheir position. What\u2019s less certain is the\npolitical and economic interests that lie\nbehind this declaration. Let the debate\nbegin on those.\u201d\nWhen asked about the controversial\nchoice of venue considering she is trying to reach as many people as possible,\nGupta stressed the think tank was nothing more than a meeting spot for her and\nher two colleagues: \u201cOne thing we need\nto get very clear is that this declaration\nwas in no way funded, or even launched\nby the AIER... Where we happened to\nmeet, it was hosted by this institution.\nNow I think it\u2019s very common among\nacademics to go to meetings at various\ndifferent institutions. I think we regularly attend meetings at places where\nthe politics, as such, don\u2019t align with our\nown\u201d. She recognised their political affil-iations: \u201cThey are clearly very right wing\n- they\u2019re not libertarian. Libertarianism\nimplies that they\u2019re only interested in\nthe individual not the community\u201d, and\nexpanded on her own beliefs, emphasising that she does not share their politics.\n\u201cMy politics are extremely left wing - I\nconsider Jeremy Corbyn to be a bit too\nmuch to the centre. I think part of what\nwe\u2019re seeing is a major crisis precipitated\nby a withdrawal of funds to the NHS\nand centralisation of hospitals rather\nthan local authorities looking after local\nhospitals.\u201d\nRegarding the website, Gupta stressed\nthis didn\u2019t prove anything: \u201cthey put it\nup for us. I don\u2019t think that means sponsoring it. It\u2019s just a website. It\u2019s not an\nAIER website.\u201d However, a website is a\nresource that costs time and money to\nmaintain, particularly one that has been\ntranslated into over 40 languages, so it is\ndoubtful that this response will do much\nto assuage concerns coming from other\nscientists.\nAnother concern, reported in the\nByline Times and raised by public health\nexpert Anthony Costello, addressed\nGupta\u2019s use of private PR firm Sugrue\nCommunications. Listed as a primary\npress contact on Gupta\u2019s March COVID model, they have been reportedly\nassisting her throughout the pandemic\nand were the ones who arranged the FeCONTINUED\n10%\nof 18-49 year olds\naffected by \u2018long\nCOVID\u2019\nIllustration credits: Nicolas Geiseler Toran\nThe Great Barrington Declaration is an open letter policy proposal that opposes lockdown.\n\n"

MP Zarah Sultana opposed the Bill as it \u201cdoesn\u2019t prohibit tor-ture, murder or sexual violence\u201d. These\nclaims are inaccurate. All public authorities are bound by Human Rights Act\n1998 to act in under the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cECHR\u201d).\nArticle 3 of ECHR\nprohibits torture and\ninhuman or degrad-ingtreatment.Unlike\nmost other Rights\nprotected by ECHR\nwhich are qualified,\nprohibition of torture is absolute. There\nis no circumstance\nthat could justify an\ninterference against\nArticle 3. As such,\nthis Bill can never be\nused as a defence in\ncourt against torture\nor sexual violence. Regarding murder,\nArticle 2 allows deprivation of life only\nunder 3 circumstances. All of which are\npowers authorities already have and this Bill\ngrants nothing addi-tional.\nBut none of these\nsafeguards derives\nfrom the merits of\nthe Bill itself; they\nwere enshrined into\nhuman right leg-islations and UK\u2019s\ninternational treaty\nobligations. Instead,\nthis Bill opens up\nthe bucket of worms\nthat allows for routine transgressions of the law by the authorities and frustrates options of remediation against abuse of power, things\nwhich will quickly erode people\u2019s confidence in the state.\nThe most significant issue of this Bill\nis the grant of criminal immunity to an\nexceptionally wide range of authorities.\nThe Bill applies not just to MI5, MI6\nandGCHQ\u2013onesweexpecttoconduct\ncrimes, but also any police force. The 45\nterritorial police forces are not centrally\nmanaged and have a widely varying level of competence and professionalism.\nThe Bill allows all to independently issue\n\u201ccriminal conduct authorisations\u201d without external oversights.\nThe government claims, in their Explanatory Notes to the Bill, that author-Covert Human Intelligence Sources\nBill: Not a licence to kill, but worse\nAndyWang\nCommentWriter\nWriter Andy Wang gives a critical analysis of the CHIS Bill currently being debated in Parliament.\nTHIS TYPE\nOF OVERDELEGATION\nOF POWER HAS\n...

    "content": "FRIDAY 30TH OCTOBER 2020\n29\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSUSTAINABILITY\nWhy is waste normal?\nIf you didn\u2019t know already, on the 1st\nOctober 2020, a ban on throwaway\nplastics came into place in England, including plastic straws, plastic cotton\nbuds and plastic stirrers. However, establishments can still provide straws to\npeople with specific medical needs or a\ndisability (for whom straws were created\nfor in the first place).\nThis ban will remove billions of disposable plastic items from circulation\nevery year and reduce the amount the\nUK contributes to the 150 million\ntonnes of plastic waste in the ocean. I\nfeel like the general public will see this as\nan environmental \u2018win\u2019, considering the\nrise in popularity of sea turtles in recent\nyears. However, I do beg to question\nwhether this is showing commitment\nto the protection of the environment\nfor the planet and people, or is this just\nanother greenwashing ploy? It is positive to see that the government have not\nbrought in a blanket ban and have considered the importance of straws in the\ndaily lives of people with disabilities or\nfor their use in hospitals and clinics.\nNevertheless, this ban does seem like\nthe picking of low-hanging fruit. What\nI mean is that this is just one small element of the significant plastic pollution\nproblem and disposability culture we\ncurrently live in. If the government truly\ncared about the plastic pollution prob-lem, they would have already banned\nall single-use plastics and invested in reducing plastic packaging production. A\nspokesperson for DEFRA (Department\nfor Food, Environment and Rural Affairs) said the government\nare \u2018absolutely committed to\nturning the tide on the widespread use of single-use plastics\u2019,\nbutweareyettoseethisareality.\nFurthermore, the UK\u2019s 25 Year\nEnvironment Plan is not ambitious enough as the target to\neliminate avoidable plastic waste\nis 2042! This current lack-lustre\napproach is worrying for future\ngenerations and shows how little the government care for climate and environmental justice.\nWhen I worked in a not-to-be-named supermarket a few years\nago, I was exposed to the role of institutions in the production of waste. At the\nend of the day when the doors closed to\ncustomers, we moved in for the night\nshift to stock shelves and unsold fresh\nbakery goods were all thrown away every\nsingle night. The normalisation of this\nact was startling. Even more shocking to\nme was the fact that we meant to report\nany sightings of people trying to \u2018steal\u2019\nthe thrown-away goods from the rubbish bins overnight. It is scary to think\nthat we live in a world in which using\n\u2018unsellable\u2019 food (potentially unsafe), is\nstealing. Furthermore, not only do we\nproduce a lot of waste, but so often this\nwaste cannot be used. In the UK this\ndoesn\u2019t just happen with food, but every\nsingle good, from dishwashers to cuf-flinks to potatoes.\nWaste, as we know it, is a human con-cept. Humans\nare not inherently wasteful beings, yet\nour behaviour\nshift started to\nhappen after\nWorld War 2,\nas the industry\nsaw an opportunity to make\nprofit gains\nquickly. How\nwe saw our day\nto day items\ntransformed by\nstrong marketing initiatives\nof plastic and\npackaging industry. With the design\nof disposable plastics, the potential of\nhigh economic gain was too good for\nthe production companies to resist, and\nso they began the trend that still permeates today. These companies contributed\nto designing the world today and the\nmultitude of environmental and social\nproblems within it. Supposed disposable plastic and other disposable objects,\nsuch as clothing, people began to buy\nmore than they needed in what we now\ncall overconsumption. The design of dis-posability for profit has shaped how we\nlive and contributes to the crises we find\nourselves in today.\nWe don\u2019t think twice about buying\na plastic bag. We use it for as long as it\ntakes to get home, and then we throw it\naway, so often that this act is engrained\nin our muscle memory. We don\u2019t consider how long it took to produce the bag,\nwho made it or what pollution it may\nhave caused in the process. Neither do\nwe think about what happens to the bag\nonce it is collected by our local council,\nfor landfill or recycling.\nHow long will the bag\nbe around? Does it\ndecompose, and what\ncontamination might\nit cause in the process?\nAs recycling is such\nan institutionalised\nprocess, it takes the\nresponsibility away\nfrom the producer.\nThe normalcy of the\nact of recycling, as a\nnatural occurrence to\nour modern existence,\nmakes it seem simply\npart of our routine to\nbuy disposable plastic\nbecause we can recycle it. Recycling also takes the guilt away\nfrom the supposed eco-conscious con-sumer.\nHowever, putting the focus on the\nconsumer and municipal recycling infrastructures is precisely what the plas-tic-producing industry want us to do.\nThe mega-producers of disposables design for mass-over-consumption, and\nwe are now wired to buy into this, or we\noften have no other choice of product.\nCompanies can make a higher profit\nif they offload their waste externalities\nonto the recycling system, which is an\nenergy-using and\npollution producing process\nand often leads\nto down-cycling,\nwhere materials\nare transformed\ninto a product\nof lesser value\nthan before. Furthermore, not\neverything that\nwe put into recycling bins is recycled. A lot of what we\nseparate into different bins at home and\nwork, ends up in the landfill, often due\nto the complexity of the plastic product or the lack of infrastructure. Even\nmore concerning is that many countries in the Global North, i.e. the USA\nand the UK, have been known to send\ntheir waste abroad to South East Asia,\nand to be building waste incinerators\nin the Global South too. The legacy of\ncolonialism and imperialism has led to\nthose who produce and profit from plastic pollution, not to bear the brunt of its\nafter-life.\nIt is useful to frame the process of re-cyclingasanotherwayofdisposal,which\nDr Max Liboiron discusses at depth in\nher work on Discard Studies. A complete re-thinking of the way we design\nproducts and packaging is needed, highlighted by the work of The Slow Factory\non \u2018Waste Led Design Systems\u2019 in which\nthe end life of a product is considered\nfromthebeginningofthedesignprocess.\nIbelievethattheremustbeashiftinhow\nwevalueobjects,materialsandlabour,to\nreducetheproductionandconsumption\nof disposable goods and to re-cultivate a\nre-use culture.

He agreed to be interviewed\nabout his favourite basketball moments\nin the basketball club. However, it is\nvery difficult to find just one favourite\nmoment, so instead, we\u2019ve asked him to\ntalk about the three best moments he\u2019s\nhad with the club. In\nmostsports,yourfirst\nand last game can be\nthe most memora-ble, such as watching\nKobe Bryant in his\nlast game score 60\npoints (which also\nhappenstobeKenny\u2019s\nfavourite moment in\nsports history). It is\ntheonethatcanbring\na lot of emotion: anxiety, excitement,\nhappiness,pride,andacceptance.There\u2019s\nalso the big games: finals in a champion-ship, promotion games, or games where\nyour family or friends come and watch.\nBut sometimes, the most memorable\nmoments you have can come from random games that you expected to maybe\nblend into memory after a few years. At\nthe end of the day, sometimes you don\u2019t\neven remember how the game ended;\nthe important part of the game was how\nyou felt in a specific moment. Kenny\u2019s\nmoments encompass all these. His best\nmemory was against Bucks university, in\nHigh Wycombe. Bucks university may\nhave a small reputation of having referees that think there is no way Bucks has\ndone anything wrong and should never\nget called on, and that the other team\nis absolutely atrocious and is out to get\nthem. During the game, a lot of Imperial\u2019s players had a few fouls, including\nKenny, who had four (in basketball, if\nyou have five fouls, you get kicked out\nof the game, similar to a red card).\nAfter a long game,\nthe last minute\ncomes along and\nsomehow Imperial\nare only 4 points\ndown (\u201csomehow\u201d\nbeing that the other team was given\nenough free shots\nfor it to be embarrassing if they didn\u2019t win). Imperial had\npossession and was able to score, so we\nwere being down only 2 points. As the\nball is inbounded, Imperial foul so that\nBucks have to start from the half court\nand the timer stops. BUCKS inbounds\nthe ball again from the half court to\ntheir main player, \u201cwho I was in charge\nof defending\u201d. As their main player starts\nto move, \u201cI manage to steal the ball, run\ndown to the basket, and go up for a lay-up. The buzzer sounds just\nas I make [the basket]\u201d. This\nties the game and puts it\ninto overtime, which sadly\nImperial lost. Even though\nImperial lost in overtime,\nthat steal and buzzer beater made the game. Kenny\u2019s\nfirst game at Imperial ranks\nsecond in his favourite mo-ments. \u201cIn my first game, I\nremember I was really nervous because I hadn\u2019t played\nin 6 months, and I had\nmade it into the Men\u2019s Second Team. I was also told\nI would be in the starting\n5. I was really excited and\nI wanted to prove myself.\u201d\nThe team had travelled to\nPortsmouth for this game,\nwhich was a 2.5 hour journey to play Portsmouth\u2019s\nfirst team. As the game\nstarted, \u201cI quickly realized\nthat this team was absolutely incredible\u201d and they had home court\nadvantage and had a lot of supporters on\ntheir side. Imperial at this time had only\nmanaged to have trials and one training\nsession together due to the late start of\nthe season, so they lacked team chemistry and hadn\u2019t played together before.\nTherefore \u201cwe got demolished! We lost\noverall by 40 points\u2026 It was embarrass-ing, they were insane!\u201d Even with that\ndefeat, there can still be moments that\nredeem you (in parts). \u201cIn the dire moments of the game, they had a fast break.\nThey had this guy that kind of looked\nlike Ben Simmons, quite tall, and muscular\u2026 They passed it out to him and he\nwas by himself running down the court,\nand I come running down behind him.\nHe goes up for a dunk and I block him!\nEveryone on our team got so gassed!\u201d\nThe player tries to have the referee call\na foul (which is what a lot of players do\nwhen they get blocked and are a little\nembarrassed, even though they know it\nwas fair play), but the referee said that\nblock was all ball so he didn\u2019t get the\nfoul either! At the end, when we were\ntalking about the game, our captain said\n\u201cguys we may have lost by 40, but we\nare gonna remember that block!\u201dAnd\nKenny\u2019s third ranked greatest memory comes from his last game in his first\nyear. His team had won the previous\ngame, \u201cso we all started the game pretty\nconfident, the team had played together\nmore and we had team chemistry, and\nI felt more comfortable\u201d. As the game\ngoes on, Imperial realizes they are doing\ngreat! Since we were doing well, \u201cI pop\nup for a three and it goes in. So I\u2019m like,\nokay, feeling good, I\u2019m comfortable. So\nI decide to go for a second three, which\nwas a bit further out, and it goes in. I\u2019m\ngetting even more confident\u201d. So then\nthe game goes into second half, where\nthe teams switch sides of the court. Kenny is coming down the side of the court\nwith the ball where the Surrey bench is\nand their players are saying \u201cleave him,\nhe can\u2019t shoot\u201d. To this, Kenny \u201cwanted\nto show them up, so I pull up for a three\nand it goes in. I turn around, look at\nthem, put my finger over my mouth, and\nshush them as a joke. I was smiling and\nlaughing and they were laughing as well\u201d.\nImperial won that game, but \u201cthat was a\ngood moment!\u201d\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n32 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nBest Moments at Imperial Basketball from the President\nCredits: Zhuoqi Li\nMen\u2019s 2 Team picture against Surrey\nAmanda Barden Sport Editor\nMen\u2019s 2 Team picture in Portsmouth\nCredits: Zhuoqi Li\nI WAS REALLY\nEXCITED AND\nI WANTED TO\nPROVE MYSELF!\n\u201c\nIf you or anyone you know wants\nto talk about their favourite moments in their sports club, please\ndo get in touch at Sports.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Though\nI fall into the latter category, I would\nlike to preface this article by saying that\nneither side is evil.\nBoth sides argue from different points\nof principle, but with a common goal: to\nsave lives. Abuse that is mudslung from\none side of the debate to the other does\nnothing but polarise debate and make a\nviable solution less likely.\nIn late March when the UK and over\nhalf of the European countries had\nclosed the door on the world in order\nthat they avert the virus and keep others safe, the messaging from national\ngovernments was clear: we are locking\nyou down to increase hospital capacity\nand stem the flow of the virus. At this\ntime, the government had my full support in its approach; we did not know\nof the dangers of this virus and bucking\nthe global trend was not a political price\nworth paying.\nAnd so, from late March, we all did\nour duty to our Queen and country\nand stayed within our four walls in the\nhope that in the meantime, NHS capacity would be ramped up to withstand a\npotential inundation of hospitalisations\nfurther down the line.\nThe government succeeded in this\nand save for a couple of hospitals in the\nnorth-west of the capital, not one hospital was overwhelmed with coronavirus\npatients at the peak of the pandemic in\nmid April. With the ramping up of ca-pacity, it wasn\u2019t just the nurses and doc-torswhowereonthefrontline:thearmy\nhad been drafted in to assist in the construction of the Nightingale Hospital in\nthe Excel centre. The capacity was and is\nnow available and the speed with which\nit was done should be commended.\nSo what is the plan now? If the original plan was to ensure our hospitals\nwere readily equipped for a surge in hospital admissions,\nthen that has been\nachieved. If the\nplan is now to\neradicate this virus altogether and\ntherefore hold out\nfor a vaccine, then\nI am convinced\nwe will kill more\npeople with this\napproach than\nwhich we intend\nto save.\nA safe and trialled vaccine on\naveragetakesbetweententofifteenyears\ntodevelop.Livingwiththeserestrictions\nfor such a period of time will lay waste\nthousands upon thousands of small/me-dium sized businesses, soar unemployment figures, and send people\u2019s mental\nhealth into the doldrums. Just this last\nweek, the suicide preven-tioncharity,Papyrus,said\nthat it was \u201crun off\nits feet\u201d with 90\npercent of all calls\nbeing linked to\nthe lockdown.\nWith this in\nmind, I now believe that the\nnarrative must\nshift from fearing this virus to\nlearning to live\nwith it. Compromises such as furloughing those that fall into vulnerable\ncategories during a spike in cases can\nbe made, but quarantining the entire,\nhealthy population should no longer be\na viable solution.\nAny further lockdowns will delay any\nspread rather than prevent it and given\nthe uncertainty of the emergence of a\nvaccine in the next year or so, we can ill\nafford to carry on like this.\nAn alternative approach that I am\npledging my support to is the Great\nBarrington Declaration which states its\nintention of \u2018focused protection\u2019 and\nwhose signatories include highly acclaimed epidemiologists such as Dr Sunetra Gupta and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. I\nwould urge all readers and students alike\nto peruse the declaration in their spare\ntime and share it widely.\nEndemic to our society is the corona-virus, and endemic to life is risk. I now\nbelieve that we must learn to accept this\nrisk as much as we do every other for a\nlife without risk, is a life not worth liv-ing.\nComment writer Marwan Riach gives his view on why further lockdowns will be counterproductive in dealing with the pandemic.\nWe need to consider alternatives to\na lockdown\nMarwanRiach\nCommentWriter\nAvid anti-lockdown campaigner and conspiracy enthusiast Piers Corbyn (Right) with Marwan Riach (Left) .\n...

The concept arrived in the\nUK in 2018 and is now one of the leaders in London Zero-waste shopping;\nthey have stores in Chiswick and Battersea, but like the Bulk Market, also have\nonline delivery systems.

Finally,\nit\u2019s also important to remember that\nwhen it comes to sustainability, the best\nthing to do is to reduce consumption in\ngeneral - purchasing sustainably is the\nnext best option.\nThis week\u2019s inspiration: A Plastic Ocean\nAPlastic Ocean is a documentary\nthat captures the tragic realities of\nour love-hate relationship with plastic. I\nstill vividly remember watching this two\nsummers ago during a family holiday\nin Japan. Coincidentally, Japan ranks\nnumber 2 in global per-capita plastic us-age. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see why, given\nthat every single cookie is individually\nwrapped in plastic inside a larger plastic\npackage.\nA Plastic Ocean opened my eyes to\nthe reality of our love-hate relationship\nwith plastic. Lightweight, cheap and\nsturdy, the very reasons we began using\nplastic for, has now become the reasons\nwhy they\u2019re so destructive for our plan-et. The producer, Producer Jo Ruxton\nfelt a deep sense of urgency to alert societies about this issue, upon witnessing\nthe Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage patch is\na region of ocean between Hawaii and\nCalifornia and happens to be one of the\nlargest offshore marine debris and plastic accumulation hotspots in the world\nspanning across 1.6 million square kilo-metres. To put it into perspective, that\u2019s\ntwo times the size of Texas or three\ntimes the size of France.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that once plastic\nwaste accumulates in these regions,\nthey don\u2019t go away \u2013 they break down\nmechanically or by solar energy, into\nmicroplastics. Microplastics are so small\nwe can hardly see them, but that\u2019s what\nmakes them lethal. They not only harm\nmarine wildlife but accumulate in food\nchains and eventually end up in our\nbodies every time we eat seafood.\nAlthough plastic production began\nin the 1950s, nearly half of the current\nplastic waste that exists come from just\nthe last 14 years. Much of it boils down\nto the fact that we\u2019re\noblivious to just how\nmuch single-use plastic waste we produce\nand how damaging\nit is. A Plastic Ocean\noffers a detailed understanding of both\ntopics, including cut-ting-edge research\nand scientists who\nattests to the dangers\nthat await our future\nif we don\u2019t act.\nIt\u2019s a 1.5-hour watch and is bound to\nchange the way you think about plastic\nwaste.

These restrictions were\nenacted by governments based on advice from their own\nscientists, representing the consensus\nview on how to deal\nwith the pandem-ic. This strategy requires locking down\nuntil a functional\ntest and trace system\ncan be implemented\nto identify and isolate new infections.\nAfter this period,\nlockdown lifts, while\npublic health measures such as mandatory masks and restrictions on large gather-ingsarekeptinplace.Unlikeincountries\nsuch as New Zealand, the test and trace\nsystem in the UK has not been effective\nenough to avoid a second lockdown, and\nthus the system was identified by the\nGovernment\u2019sScientificAdvisoryGroup\nfor Emergencies (SAGE) as unable to\ncurb the uncontrolled growth in cases in\nthe last two months. The test-and-trace\nsystem is hoped to be temporary, as governments are relying on the approval of a\nsafe and effective COVID vaccine in the\nnext few months, allowing normal life to\nresume once it is distributed.\nARGUMENTS\nAGAINST\nRESTRICTIONS\nOntheothersideofthescientificcommunity, researchers have been calling for\na completely different approach to controlling - or even putting an end to - the\npandemic: naturally acquired herd im-munity. To find out more about this pro-posal, Felix interviewed Sunetra Gupta,\nProfessor of Theoretical Epidemiology\nat the University of Oxford, who has\nbeenthemostprominentacademiccritic\nof the policy consensus and who co-au-thored the\nG r e a t\nBarrington Declaration.\nT h e\nDeclaration rests\non the\nconcept\nof herd\ni m m u -nity. In\nthis ap-proach,\nall vulnerable individuals would be shielded,\nwhile the rest of the population resumes\nnormal life with no restrictions, allowing\nthem to become infected, recover, and\nthereby acquire immunity to COVID.\nA threshold of 60-70% of the population who have recovered from COVID\nwould need to be surpassed to achieve a\nreliable level of herd immunity. The term\n\u2018herd immunity\u2019, as noted by Fine et al in\nthe Clinical Infectious Diseases journal,\n\u201cis widely used but carries a variety of\nmeanings\u201d. To Gupta, \u201cit does not refer\nto, in this case, a level of exposure or immunity that causes the virus to disappear.\nIt refers to a level of immunity which is\nan equilibrium. These are dynamic systems which settle and hover around an\nendemic equilibrium, and the population level at that endemic equilibrium is\nwhat we call the herd immunity threshold\u201d, suggesting that her view of herd\nimmunity is one where the infected proportion of the population remains con-stant, rather than exponentially decaying\nas other definitions of herd immunity\nwould require.\nThe Declaration was also co-authored\nby Gupta\u2019s colleagues: Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, professors of\nmedicine at Stanford and Harvard re-spectively. In it, the professors lay out\ntheir proposal, called \u201cFocused Protection\u201d and call on governments all over\nthe world to lift lockdown, as \u201ckeeping\nthese measures in place until a vaccine is\navailable will cause irreparable damage,\nwith the underprivileged disproportionately harmed\u201d.\nThis emphasis on the harmful effects\nof lockdown is seen throughout the Declaration, and throughout the interview\nwith Felix, Gupta emphasised those effects as the primary motivation behind\ntheir proposal. \u201cIt seems to me that these\nother strategies are just not addressing\nthecostsoflockdown.\u201dshesaid,referring\ntothepoliciesenactedbymostcountries.\nIt is right that these concerns are\nbrought up and discussed; it is evident\nthat lockdowns contribute to a decline\nin mental health,\nparticularly for\nyoung people. A\nsurvey by mental health charity Young Minds\nrevealed that 80% of young people in\nthe UK felt the pandemic made their\nmental health worse, with 87% reporting increased loneliness and isolation in\nlockdown. Meanwhile, a BBC Panorama investigation found domestic abuse\nreports soared during lockdown with 3\nin 4 victims identifying the restrictions\nas a barrier to escaping their abusers.\nFurther, police data showed that BAME\npeople were being disproportionately\nfined under coronavirus restriction laws,\nexacerbating the systemic biases in law\nenforcement. This is not to mention the\neffect lockdowns can have on economies\nparticularly reliant on the service sector,\nleading to job losses if adequate government support is not provided alongside\nthe restrictions.\nHowever, scientists representing the\nconsensus view have been keen to agree\nwith these critiques and have stressed\nthat a cycle of lockdowns is not the answer \u2013 rather, a lockdown is a tool to buy\ntime to invest in healthcare services and\nin test-and-trace systems.\nARGUMENTS FOR\nRESTRICTIONS\nScientists promoting the so-called\n\u2018herdimmunity\u2019strategy,particularlythe\nauthorsoftheGreatBarringtonDeclara-tion, have come under scathing criticism.\nFrom the problem of our lack of knowledge around COVID immunity, to disputes about how vulnerable individuals\ncan be identified and fully isolated from\nthe rest of the population, the scientific\ncommunity has not eased off its criticism\nsince the Declaration was published on\nOctober 4th.\nThe main concern\nthat many scientists\nhave raised is the duration of immunity.\nRupert Beale, Head of\nthe Cell Biology of Infection Laboratory at the Francis Crick\ninstitute, claimed that the Declaration\nwas not a helpful contribution to the debate on COVID policy, explaining that\n\u201cwe know that immunity to coronavi-ruses wanes over time, and re-infection\nis possible \u2013 so lasting protection of vulnerable individuals by establishing \u2018herd\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nNatalia Glazman Science Writer\nAre restrictions really necessary to deal\nwith the coronavirus pandemic?\n\u201c\nTHESE MEASURES WILL\nCAUSE IRREPARABLE\nDAMAGE, WITH THE\nUNDERPRIVILEGED\nDISPROPORTIONATELY\nHARMED\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\n87%\nof young people\nexperiencing\nlockdown\nloneliness\nFelix sat down with Professor Sunetra Gupta, the chief proponent of the anti-restriction \u2018Great Barrington Declaration\u2019, to discuss\nherd immunity, lockdowns, and the various concerns about her work voiced by mainstream scientists.\n\n"

The conventional wisdom in\n2016 predicted a Trump victory\nwould trigger a market sell-off,\nyet it outperformed for years.\nIndeed, if history is any guide,\nrisk markets are somewhat impervious to the outcome of the\nelection, having done well under\nboth Democratic- and Republican-led White Houses since\n1932. As measured by the S&P\n500 Index, the market has historically performed marginally\nbetter under Democratic than\nunder Republican administra-tions, but best under divided\ngovernment.\nWhile the direction of the overall\nstock market may be hard to predict, it is\neasier to forecast which sectors are likely\nto be winners and losers under the two\nelection scenarios.\nWhat policy changes should we expect\nfrom a Democratic sweep?\nFelix investment expects a Biden\nWhite House and a Democrat-controlled Congress to prioritize legislation\nthat would:\n1.

    "content": "tiesover2weekstofindoutifsheliedon\nher daughter\u2019s school application form.\nThe second major issue was the creeping scope of circumstances under which\ncriminal immunities are granted.\nRIPA permits the most intrusive\nforms of surveillance to be performed\nwhen it is necessary to prevent and detect serious crimes. The phrase \u201cserious\ncrime\u201d is not a vague catch-all but a\nwell-defined term: it means a crime for\nwhich a 21-year-old with no previous\nconvictionscouldexpecttobesentenced\nfor at least 3 years, or violence that either\nresults in substantial financial gain or is\nconducted by a large group of people.\nIn contrast, the Bill permits a criminal\nconduct authorisation to be issued for\n\u201cpreventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder\u201d. This means any crime\nwhatsoever. One has to ask, is it ever\nnecessary or proportionate to commit\na (potentially serious) crime in order to\nprevent or detect a non-serious crime?\nIndeed, the Bill requires any authorised\ncriminal conduct to be proportionate\nto its ends, but it stopped short of limiting power to its original\nscope.\nThe third issue\nis the lack of judicial oversight and\nwhat I regard as a\ngross interference\nagainst the judici-ary.\nThe Investigatory Powers Act\n2016 aka. \u201cSnoopers Charter\u201d updated the framework under which\nintelligence agencies can intercept\ncommunications.\nInterception Warrants need to be\napproved in advance by both the Home Secretary and\na senior judge. There is no similar safeguard in the Bill for committing crimes.\nAll judicial scrutiny will have to be done\npost-mortem, after the crime has been\ncommitted.\nIn the Explanatory Note, the government claims that activities conducted outside an authorisation are not\nimmune from prosecutions. But what\nabout activities conducted under an unlawful authorisation? The government\ndodged this question in Parliament, so\nit\u2019s likely that such activities carry impu-nity. The authorisation itself can only be\nchallenged through the secretive Investigatory Power\u2019s Tribunal \u2013 a process neither short, nor easy, nor cheap.\nThe House of Commons Library\nthinks \u201cthe Bill would limit redress for\nvictims by preventing civil claims for injury or other harm\u201d. If this is correct, it\nmeans no one can bring a civil lawsuit\nagainst an agent for committing crimes\nunder the authorisation, even when the\nvictim is an innocent \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. The ability to bring civil claim is\nimportant because under criminal pro-ceedings, the high standard of proof\n(\u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, i.e. \u201csure\u201d)\nmeans that a conviction could be diffi-cult; whereas the victim is much more\nlikely to win in a civil court presenting\nthe same set of evidence, due to lower\nstandard of proof (\u201con the balance of\nprobabilities\u201d, i.e. \u201clikely\u201d). For instance,\nsome victims of sexual assault in Scotland have been advised to bring a civil\nlawsuit against the abuser when the evidence is convincing but leaves room for\nreasonable doubts.\nAs the Chair of the Parliamentary\nSecurity and Intelligence Committee\nJulian Lewis pointed out during the\ndebate, the intelligence agencies knew\nthat they possess no legal immunity and\nare bound by all civil and criminal laws\nequally; rather, they rely on convincing\nthe prosecutor that it is not in the public\ninterest to prosecute. This is, in my opin-ion,therightapproach,asitappliespres-sureandboundarytoallactionsmadeby\na covert agent to be within the public in-terest, which would have to then be tested by the prosecutors in the usual\nmanner as they conduct\nthe public interest test to any\nother charging\ndecisions.

This is blatantly misleading.\nOrdinary police forces have always oper-atedundertheassumptionthattheycan-not authorise anyone to break the law.\nIf there is a frequent need for ordinary\npolice forces\u2019 undercover officers and informants to commit certain crimes, then\nthe Parliament should grant them power\nspecific and limited to those particular\ncrimes they need to commit, rather than\na blank cheque on all crimes. One example of this was the Sexual Offences Act\n2003, which explicitly granted members\nof MI5 and GCHQ immunity for making indecent (pseudo-)photographs of\nchildren \u2013 not all police forces, and not\neven the MI6, as such immunity would\nnot be necessary or proportionate for\ntheir functions. This implies the Parliament was operating under the understanding that it is not lawful for public\nauthorities to commit crimes as they saw\nnecessary, but only when so permitted\nby legislation; otherwise the explicit exemption would\nnot have been\nnecessary.\nThis type of\nover-delega-tion of power\nhas its precedence and has\nled to a plethora of abuse.\nThe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\n( \u201c R I PA\u201d ) ,\nwhich this\nBill amends,\nprovides legal\ngrounds and\ns a f e g u a r d s\non activities\nsuch as wiretapping and intrusive sur-veillance. Much of the power set out by\nRIPA was granted to almost all public\nauthorities, including local councils.\nCouncils then happily made good use\nof these surveillance powers to, among\nother things, spy on council employees\u2019\ncar parking, working hours and sick pay\nclaims;findoutthepigeonfeeder;andin\none case in Poole, the council followed a\nmother\u2019s movement, watched her in her\nhouse and drew up a profile of her activi-ria like those currently being used by\npublic prosecutors.\nIn summary, this is a Bill which grants\nthe power to authorise crimes to all sorts\nof authorities, under vaguely defined circumstances with no judicial oversight\nand little legal recourse to victims of\nabuse of power.\nBut worry not, our beloved Home\nSecretary Priti Patel has promised us at\nthe beginning of the bill:\n\u201cIn my view the provisions of the CovertHumanIntelligenceSources(Criminal\nConduct) Bill are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201d\nIf you think you can wrtie, and you\ncan write what you think, send us your\nopinions to fcomment@ic.ac.uk\n...

    "content": "If you have staunchly ruled\nout watching The Texas\nChainsaw Massacre this\nHalloween, then perhaps\nSuspiria (1977 version) will\nbe a more palatable substi-tute; it is far less abrasive\nthan Texas Chainsaw (hell, what isn\u2019t?), and keeps\nitself at a distance, establishing a tempo that is\nfar more refined and much less frenetic. Suspiria\nfollows Suzy Bannion (played by Jessica Harper):\nan American ballet-dancer who has recently joined\na prestigious Tanz Academy in Germany. As her\nstudies get under way, the mysteries of the institution unravel themselves\u2014students disappear,\nmatrons shuffle around at night, and the school\u2019s\nsuspicious directress is much discussed, though\nrarely seen.\nWithout hesitation or hyperbole, I can say that\nthe soundtrack and cinematography of Suspiria\nwill blow you away. The music is electric, and the\nrepetition of the central theme is hypnotic. In the\nfew scenes where the tempo is about to let up, the\ntheme tune sounds and a new, ethereal energy is\nbreathed into the picture. The final element to this\nnear-perfect horror film is the cinematography by\nLuciano Tovoli. The colour palette\u2014consisting of\ncorporeal reds and fleshly crimsons\u2014washes over\nyou as it does Suzy, giving you no sense of direc-tion, no chance of escape. The persistent glares of\ncarnal reds and cobalt blues come to embody both\nlight and dark, the natural and the supernatural,\nthe real and the imagined.

Reassuringly, Hal Ashby does not\nseem to demand that we\nsettle that distinction\u2014it\nis sufficient that we are\nleft conjecturing: \u2018Who is Chance the Gardiner?\u2019. A\nman who has resided in the same house, tending the\nsame garden, year upon year, never leaving; a man\nwhose understanding of the world has come from the\nTV and the radio; a man whose idle speech is twisted into profundity, allowing him rise up the ranks\nof society and into the world of talk show hosts and\nsocialites, ambassadors and presidents; a man who\u2019s\nable to walk on water, not because he knows he can,\nbut rather because he never learned that he couldn\u2019t.\nPerhaps Chance is merely a satire, and his success\na jab at the willingness of the political elites to hear\nwhat they want, to look, not for change or substance,\nbut for charisma and empty optimism. I think that\nis partly true, but that is not all he is. Sure, we, the\naudience, see where Chance has come from, and\nare privy to more information than the characters\non screen.

Why is\nthis? Do we all see in Chance what we wish to see in\nthe world? Does Ashby decide to show him walking\non water because, deep down, we know that such a\nmiracle is needed to save our washed-out politics?\nOr is Chance a warning that all of us can be lulled\ninto irrational beliefs, even if it is just for a second?\nOf course, before his benefactor passes away,\nChance really is a gardener; however, once he steps\ninto the world, he becomes a mirror for all acquaint-ances, a tablet on which they chip their sorrows, a\nclay man that they can mould into a solution. For\nthose infatuated by power or money, Chance is their\nmouthpiece, and likewise, for those intent on friendship and love, Chance is the warmth and good-spirit\nthey so badly crave. Ultimately, he is more a reflection of your own character than any outstanding feature of his; he is the ideal man to meet the needs of\nthose that meet him.\nIn my opinion, Chance is an echo, the inevitable\neffect of all causes finding form in the world. As\nsuch, he is the totality of characters: he is a companion to those who yearn for affection; a business partner and financial advisor; a suit mistaken for sense;\nhe is a backroom scandal at a bourgeois party; he is\na friend for those resigned to death; a little boy who\nnever grew old; a white man gaming a broken sys-tem; 15 minutes of fame; the saviour of the world;\nhe is the impotence of men in power; a mistaken\nmember of a rival gang; the zeitgeist of a broken\nage; an awkward handshake with a slimy lawyer; an\neccentric man in a stately dining hall; the next President of the United States; a tabula rasa; a state of\nmind; a Christly figure saving the damned; the will\nof men within this world; Gautama under the bodhi\ntree; a blissful season of deliverance.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nSuspiria\nFRIDAY 30TH OCTOBER 2020\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com 21\nDirectedby: Hal Ashby\nYearof Release: 1979\nStarring: Peter Sellers; Shirley MacLaine; Melvyn Douglas\nDirectedby: Dario Argento\nYearof Release: 1977\nStarring: Jessica Harper\nBeing There\nThe stunning neon glow that pervades throughout Suspiria\nDO WE ALL SEE IN\nCHANCE WHAT\nWE WISH TO SEE\nIN THE WORLD?\n\u201c\nPeter Sellers, as Chance, in Being There\u2019s iconic final shot\nCredits: Hal Ashby & United Artists\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n18\nARTS\nSince its inception in 2000, Tate Britain has been in\nan uneasy marriage, struggling to accommodate its\nvast collection of classical art with its apparent ambition to be the next Tate Modern. In 2017, Art Critic,\nJonathan Jones, urged for the museum to embrace its\npre-20thcenturycollectionofartinascathingopinion\narticle appearing in The Guardian. He wrote, \u2018It seems\nto be a requirement that, to work at\nthe national museum of British art,\nyou shouldn\u2019t like the nation\u2019s greatest art.\u2019 He further argued, \u2018It can\nshow us everything from the industrial revolution and slavery to the\nhistory of horse racing. All it needs\nto do is put as much of that collection on view as possible, with an eye\nto history.\u2019 Somewhat prophetic, the\nmuseum seemed to have heard this\ncall and put together the largest exhibition on Joseph Mallord William\nTurner\u2019s work in recent times, bringing together much of his bequest\nand shining a light on the artist and\nhis lesser known works.\nTate Britain is, in so many ways,\na museum for Turner. This is not to\nsuggest that British art begins and\nends with him, but it is an unassaila-blefactthathisworkwas,andstillis,\na corner stone of post-Renaissance\nBritish Art. Until the 18th centu-ry, the industrial revolution aside,\nAlbion was trailing behind mainland Europe, and the high arts since\nthe renaissance flourished through\nFlorentine, Venetian, Flemish, and\nFrench circles, and seldom reached\nEnglish shores with the same inten-sity. The tide, however, changed with\nthe arrival of Turner and John Constable in the late\n18th century. These two men, empowered by a bitter\nrivalry, ensured that English Art no longer found itself\nin the fringes of European high Arts.\nTurner, upon his death in 1851, bequeathed his\nentire art collection to the nation, making one of the\ngreatest donations ever made since Hans Sloane\u2019s be-questwhichsetupthefoundationsoftheBritishmuse-um. His collection, after a circuitous journey tumbling\nabout in The National Gallery and V&A Museum,\nfounditselfitscurrentquartersatTateBritain\u2014home\nto British Art.\nThe current exhibition \u201cTurner\u2019s Modern World\u201d\ndraws on this vast collection, seeking to expand our\nunderstanding of the evolution of the artist\u2019s work.\nUnashamedly embracing the collection\u2019s breadth, it\npresents a comprehensive and wonderfully curated\nexhibit of Turner\u2019s work with a penchant for deep reflection on the milieu. The late 18th and early 19th\ncentury were arguably the most turbulent and consequential period in European history, and, as with\nmany artists, this volatility filtered into his work. The\nrevolution across the channel, the Napoleonic \u2018world\u2019\nwars, reformation of the parliament, emancipation of\nCatholics at home, and the abolition of slavery; Turner\nlived through them all and as the exhibition puts it elo-quently, \u2018Though not all works of personal conviction,\nTurner saw fit to capture them all\u2019.\nThrough a series of eight thematic rooms, we explore the societal turbulence and its influence in and\nthough Turner\u2019s work. Known extensively for his\nlandscapes, the exhibition seeks to subvert this popular public opinion by underscoring his other works,\nprimarily maritime and industrial paintings. The exhibition has not shied away from using his well-known,\npopular works to thread this narrative. Indeed, we see\n\u2018The Fighting Temeraire\u2019 and \u2018Rain, Steam and Speed\n\u2013 The Great Western Railway\u2019 loaned by The National Gallery, and \u2018Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army\nCrossing the Alps\u2019 among numerous other highlights.\nIn an exhibition telling a seldom told story such as this,\nit can often be distracting to have such popular paintingstakethecentrestage,but\u2018Turners\u2019ModernWorld\u2019\ntreads this line quite carefully - not sacrificing the narrative for the grandeur and vice versa. An encouraging\nexposition of Turners attitude to slavery is presented\nwith a reproduction of his painting \u2018The Slave Ship\u2019.\nEven as a reproduction (the original, currently housed\nin the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,\nwas deemed too fragile to transport),\nit takes centre stage in presenting the\ndichotomy of progressive attitudes in\nthe early 19th century. A proponent\nof liberal trends in his later life, Turner had also infamously invested in a\nJamaican slave plantation.\nItisinterestingtonotehowalmost\nevery painting from this exhibition is\nsourced from within the Turner Bequest, meaning, sourced largely from\nwithin Tate Britain. But then again it\nis what Turner would have wanted;\nIn his will, he conditioned that his\npaintings be hung together. This was\ndisregarded over the years and a few\npieces now lie scattered between The\nNational Gallery and Tate Britain. It\nis thus encouraging to see them find\na common shelter as he wished, even\nif only temporarily during an exhibition such as this.\nOften romanticised and pigeon-holed, Joseph Mallord William\nTurner, with his modest upbringing\nin London, was the man who put\nBritish art on the world map. But\nthereismuchmoretohimasanartist\nthat sets him apart from his contem-poraries. This exhibition about him\nis striving for something much more as\nwell, and, apart from capturing the artist, it reflects on\na museum seeking to re-invent itself by looking to the\npast. It is fitting in a sense that one of the final works\nweseeintheexhibitionis\u2018War.TheExileandtheRock\nLimpet\u2019 (inset) with Napoleon standing at St. Helena,\nbrooding over his legacy. We all should do that from\ntime to time, shouldn\u2019t we? I mean reflect! So why not\nbegin at Tate Britain, where this exhibition runs from\nthe 28th of October until the 7th of March 2021.\nModern Love: Turner at Tate Britain\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Music Editor\nTurner\u2019s Modern World\nWhere?

Seb explained\nthat as a group the admins are \u201cmostly\nfor freedom of speech about any topic\non the page, with the obvious and well\nestablished caveats of inciting violence\nand slander.\u201d But the main motivation\nseems to be the thrill of doing something\nbetter than it has been done before. He\nwent on to say that this problem of\nwhat a confessions page is for, whether\nit should \u201cbe purely entertaining, and a\nliberal safe space, or whether it should\nallow people to voice unpopular opinions and have them refuted via the page\u201d\nwas one that the admins struggled to answer on a daily basis.\nYet despite this members are committed\nand dedicated. In 2020 the page has averaged 19 submissions a day, hitting 148\non 6th June and the admins have the\nair of journalists or dissidents, imbuing\ntheir role with sacred purpose behind a\nveil of inside jokes.\nThe admins are clearly proud of what\ntheyhavebuilt.\u201cHavingsuchahighlevel\nofautomationhasallowedustohaveway\nmore features than (as far as I know) any\nother uni confessions page that currently\nexists. From adding moods, to uploading\nimages and video, to automatic poll crea-tion, to emailing you when the secret has\nbeen posted. Most other uni confessions\npages use crush ninja to manage submis-sions, so because they don\u2019t have an in\nhouse solution like us, they don\u2019t get all\nthese cool features. And on top of that,\nif we think of something cool to add, we\ncan add it in a few hours\u201d\nHowever, spotting the bad posts is not\nalways easy. Admin H explained that\n\u201cthere are sometimes disagreement on\nwhat posts count as political, and a lot\nof the time chains evolve from a non-po-litical post into a political one, for example the time when a bunch of sexist\nsecrets were submitted after one women\ncomplained about being catcalled. So\nit is sometime hard to judge when that\nstarts.\u201d\nHaving a group of admins means that no\none person takes the brunt of complaints\nand reading depressing posts. As a group\nthey can \u201claugh off the posts attacking us\nand threatening to go to another page\u2026\n\u201cBut what sucks is seeing how there are\ngenuinely sexist/racist people among\nthe students.\u201d\nHaving a group also helps relieve the\nstress of the role. When asked about the\neffect of the role on their mental health\nthe group did not report any trouble,\nthough many mentioned how much\nthey sympathised\nwith the ICE admin\nwho had to moderate all the submissions themself. Havingagroupofpeople\nmeans that \u201cwhen\nwe get attacked for\nbeing a shit page for\nletting x through\nand not y, we just\nallow those submissions to be posted -it doesn\u2019t faze us in the slightest. These\nidiots have no idea how the page is run,\nthey just sit there\nsubmitting secrets\nand complaining.\nBut at the end of\nthe day, if i were\nforced to feel an\nemotion towards\nthem, it\u2019d probably\njust be sympathy\u201d\nAccusations of\ncensorship also got\na short shrift. \u201cWe\nactually chose to\nnot post anything\nmore about BLM\nbecause we felt we couldn\u2019t make the call\nbetween racist incited violence and racist flawed logic that should be refuted by\npublic discourse.\u201d\nWhen asked why they had chosen to\nreveal their identities now the team was\nsplit. Some of them made no effort to\nhide what they did, saying that the clout\nwas the major reason that they did what\nthey did. Others such as Admin H decided to remain anonymous and admitted that given the nature of some of the\nsubmissions they would \u201cnot like them\nassociated with me\u201d.\nAs of yet the group has not had any contact with College, and hopes to keep\nthat up.\nA screenshot from the Imperial Secrets messenger chat\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n8\nResearch shows that in certain in-dividuals, COVID symptoms can\nlast longer than the typical 3-10 days\none would expect from a respiratory\nillness, dramatically altering their daily\nlives through a condition known as \u2018long\nCOVID\u2019.\nFor some people, long COVID is a pro-longeddiseasestate,includingsymptoms\nsuch as lasting loss of sense of taste and\nsmell, breathlessness, and chronic pain.\nOthers may experience resurgences of\nmore \u2018typical\u2019 COVID symptoms, such\nasafeverorcough.Suchresurgencesmay\nbe mistaken for reinfections, but current\nknowledge suggests that these are extremely unlikely in such a relatively short\ntime period. Overwhelmingly, however,\nthe most common symptom is debilitating fatigue.\nIt is estimated that one in 20 people\ninfected with COVID-19 are ill for a\nminimum of 8 weeks, with many people\nbeing affected for many months. A study\nconducted in 143 people in Rome found\nthat 87% of hospital patients had a minimum of one symptom almost 2 months\nfrom the date of discharge. However,\nlong COVID does not only affect those\nwho have undergone intensive care; patients with relatively mild infections may\nalso experience this syndrome.\nA recent study performed by scientists at\nKing\u2019s College London aims to identify\npossible individual cases of long COVID\nearly on, subsequently allowing health\nservices to plan for additional care of\nearlier, more intensive treatment. Here,\ncomputational techniques were used to\nanalyse symptomatic and test result data\ninputted by individuals into the \u2018Covid\nSymptom Study\u2019 app and predict which\nof those would go on to experience long\nCOVID. However, despite the model correctly identifying 69% of people\nwho experienced long COVID, around\na quarter of results were false positives\n(i.e. were predicted to have long COVID, but in reality, underwent a speedy\nrecovery). Therefore, further research is\nrequired to perfect and adapt the model\nfor improved detection efficiency.\nNevertheless, being female, overweight\nand having underlying respiratory con-ditions, such as asthma or lung disease,\nwere all shown to increase the risk of\nlong COVID - the former of which may\nappear surprising given that men generally seem to be at higher risk of severe\ndisease and death from COVID. Perhaps less surprisingly, risk was also found\nto increase with age. Dr Claire Steves, a\nscientist involved in the King\u2019s College\nLondon study, adds: \u201cHaving more than\nfive different symptoms in the first week\nwas one of the key risk factors.\u201d\nWhile this is yet to be definitively con-firmed, numerous hypotheses exist. One\noftheseisthatdespitebeingclearedfrom\nmost of the body, the coronavirus still\nlingers in small spaces or areas. Alternatively, since the virus triggers an intensive\nimmuneresponse,anotherideaisthatthe\nimmune system does not fully return to\nits normal state, so overactive functioning causes further health problems and\ndamage. The WHO has cautioned that\nwidespread inflammation in post-COV-ID patients leads to a higher risk of heart\ndiseases at a younger age. Furthermore,\nsome unexpected organs may be affected in the long term: COVID is thought\nto alter human metabolism, resulting in\npost-COVID diabetes or lipid process-ing, cause abnormal clotting and premature ageing of blood vessels, and perhaps\neven cause changes in brain structure.\nOverall, while curbing the immediate\nspread of the pandemic remains the primary goal worldwide, discovering the\ncauses behind and treating long COVID\nwill nonetheless yield multiple benefits.\nRecognising this, the NHS has recently\nannouncedtheprovisionofa\u00a310million\npackage to fund long COVID clinics\naround the country. Despite time being a\ncrucial component of such investigation,\nwith the copious amounts of further research currently being performed, with\nevery publication we are one step closer\nto tackling this unexpected pandemic.\nLong COVID: What do we know?\nJulia Dabrowska Science Editor\nIn order to put an end to the global coronavirus pandemic, researchers\naround the world are working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to protect\nagainst COVID-19. While vaccine\nproduction usually takes multiple\nyears, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped\ntobedevelopedwithin12-18months.\nVaccine testing can be split into 5\nstages:\nPre-clinical \u2013 animal testing to see\nwhether the vaccine elicits an immune\nresponse.\nPhase I \u2013 healthy human volunteers\nto determine safety and evaluate immune response.\nPhase II \u2013 hundreds of volunteers to\nidentify correct dosage.\nPhase III \u2013 thousands of volunteers\ntoconfirmsafetyandefficacyvs.apla-cebo.\nPhase IV \u2013 studies on adverse effects,\nlong-termmmunityandvaccineusage\nfollowing the approval and licensing\nof the vaccine.\nThe WHO is currently tracking the\nprogress of over 170 candidate vac-cines; at Felix, we\u2019ve chosen 5 of the\nmost promising candidates to follow,\nso watch this space!\nNew Update: This week, the Oxford/\nAstraZeneca vaccine candidate was\nreported to have effectiveness in both\nyoungandolderadults,whichwasone\nof the greatest prior concerns.

    "content": "FRIDAY 30TH OCTOBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nThe Social Dilemma shines a light on\na world which is addicted to dopa-mine, one with its democracies under\nthreat, a mental health epidemic, and\nwhere fake news travels six times faster\nthan real news. According to former SiliconValleyplayers,themaincauseofthese\nproblems are the very social platforms\nthey helped to create. They tell us that in\ntheir pursuit of profit, online platforms\nlike Google and Facebook employed a\nbusiness model that neglected our need\nfor privacy, truth and care. This business\nmodel, which Professor Shoshna Zuboff\nnamed \u2018surveillance capitalism\u2019, works\nthrough the mass surveillance of our online personal experiences and the translation of these experiences into behavioural data. These data are then used through\na process of machine intelligence to create prediction products that anticipate\nwhat you will do now, soon, and further\ninto the future.\nWe are told that\nthe buying and\nselling of these\nprediction products creates a marketplace of human\nfutures, where\naccording to the\ncreator of virtual\nreality, Jaron Lanier, the product is\nthe gradual, imperceptible change\nin our own behaviour and perception. It\nwas Google who created the first markets to trade in human futures, what we\nnow know as online targeted advertising.\nHowever, as we saw with the Cambridge\nAnalytica scandal, our data isn\u2019t just sold\nand used in the name of consumerism,\nbut also for political ends which can\nundermine our democracies. The main\nproblem with surveillance capitalism derives from its imperative - a promise in\nthe certainty of influence. For this promise to hold true, platforms need to both\noptimise the accuracy of their prediction\nproducts and the engagement of users on\ntheir platforms.\nTo demonstrate the ways the pursuit\nof these aims is manifesting in societal\nills, the documentary presents a fictional\nnarrative of two siblings struggling with\nthe consequences of their use of social\nnetworks. The main storyline follows a\nteenage boy who is addicted to his device at the expense of his social life, and\nthen finds himself becoming increasingly involved in a political group called the\n\u2018extreme centre\u2019 and ultimately arrested\nat one of their volatile protests. In the\nstoryline, a metaphor of three men at a\ncontrol desk represent the way machine\nintelligence algorithms work. Although\nit\u2019s a silly metaphor, it does a good job\nof showing us how the algorithms structured into the design of these platforms\nexploit our primordial psychology in order to channel our attention and keep us\nengaged.\nNotifications, news feeds, and recommendations are all tailored to our individual personalities and are designed to\nkeep us online.\nIn fact, we are\ntold about a team at\nFacebook who were\nworking to maximise our dopamine\nrelease. Although,\nFacebook claims\nthat the aim of such\nresearch is to create\na better user experi-ence, we should be\nsceptical of the fact\nthis aim coincides\nwith its goals to collect as much of our\ndata as possible. The longer we stay on\ntheir platform, the more data they can\ncollect, not to mention the additional\nmoney our time on their platform gets\nthem from the advertisements we might\nclick. Regardless of what companies like\nFacebook claim, The Social Dilemma\nmakes it clear that the reality is not a better user experience. The dopamine-ori-ented design preys on our basic social desires and leads many of us to conflate our\nself-worth with our online identities; the\nresult being a generation of youth with a\nwarped sense of identity and poor mental health.\nPerhaps even more frightening is the\nway these algorithms can guide people\ntowards extreme ideologies like the \u2018extremecentre\u2019presentedinthefilm.News\nfeeds tailored to our own interests serve\nonly to reinforce our own beliefs. With\nthis, it\u2019s not surprising that when an algorithm comes across someone susceptible to the odd conspiracy theory and\nfeeds them more conspiracies on\ntheir news feed, they\u2019re\nled towards an extreme\nview that everything\nbeing presented in the\nmainstream is a lie. Unfortunately, conspiracy\ntheories tend to have\nquite a lot of news value;\naccording to research from\nMIT, fake news travels six times\nfaster than real news on social networks.\nThis same logic works for any political\nideology. The separate realities our individually tailored news feeds create mean\npeople are entrenched in their own be-liefs, unable to understand how anyone\ncould possibly think differently from\nthem. The result is an increasingly polarised world where truth has become an\nethereal notion. A world where each side\nis shouting only to themselves and where\nmany of the cries have little factual sub-stance.\nDespite what The Social Dilemma\nclaims, the solution to these problems\ndoes not lie in big tech. The narrative\nthat big tech can save us is as concerning as the problem that needs solving.\nThe Social Dilemma is trying to set the\nboundaries of who gets to be a critic and\nwhat criticism looks like; we should not\nexpect tech companies to rehabilitate\nthemselves.\nAccording to Zuboff, demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists is \u201clike\na s k i n g\na giraffe\nto have a\nshorter neck or a cow to give up chew-ing.Thesedemandsareexistentialthreats\nthat violate the basic mechanisms of the\nentity\u2019s survival.\u201d\nMany thinkers, a lot of whom are\nwomen and people of colour, and who\nare recognised as leaders when it comes\nto the insights on these problems were\nomitted from the documentary- Safiya\nNoble, Cathy O\u2019Neil and Ruha Benjamin to name a few. Their work is testament to an existing body of literature\nthat combines tech, social and ethical\nconsiderations and questions traditional tech wisdom surrounding algorithms,\nproblem-solving and money-making.\nThey highlight the implicit assumptions\nembedded in algorithms and challenge\nthe notion that market pressures lock\nus into surveillance capitalism.
