    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020\n16\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMTSoc: Footloose\nDancing is banned but cringe high school clich\u00e9s are most definitely allowed!\nT\nerm is coming\nto a close,\nexams are\nimpending, so\nthis is naturally the\nperfect time for a bunch\nof students to put on a\nproduction of the hit\nmusical Footloose!\nWith amazing singing\nand some impressive\nchoreography, I can only\nimagine the number of\nhours of Panopto they\nnow have to catch up on!\nThe plot was a little\nlacklustre, I would\ngo as far as saying\nit was non-existent.\nBasically, city boy Ren\nMcCormack (Harrison\nGoldspink) moves\nto the small town of\nBomont where dancing\nis banned! He fights\nback against the powers\nthat be, most notably\nReverend Shaw Moore\n(Mark Lord). With the\ntown\u2019s young people on\nhis side, the tides eventually turn. The classic\nthemes of small town\nAmerican high school\ndrama run throughout\nthe play. This is not\nexactly something we\ncan all relate to as Londoners, where the only\nthing that is banned is\ntalking on the tube.\nThe opening number\nseemed a bit shaky\nand could have used a\nlittle more work but the\nquality increased exponentially with \u201cLearning\nTo Be Silent\u201d, performed by Oishi Sikdar,\nCamelia Richards and\nNadya Moore, being\nthe highlight of the\nwhole show for me. This\ngirl power ballad saw\nRichards cement herself\nas the hidden talent in\nthis production. Despite\nnot always taking centre\nstage, she captured\nevery pair of eyes in the\naudience with each note\nshe sang.\nOn top of all these\nmomentous musical\nmoments, there were\nsome scenes that had the\naudience laughing out\nloud! Betty Blast (Tash\nCowan), the owner of\nthe diner, probably got\nthe biggest laugh during\nher brief roller-skating\ncameo. However, it was\nthe country bumpkin\nWillard Hewit (Sam Lee)\nwho was consistently\nthe funniest character.\nThe way Lee brought\nthe odd character to life\nwas a joy to watch and\nreally had the audience\nemotionally invested\nwhile also crying with\nlaughter.\nFinally, the leads,\nplayed by Goldspink\nand Moore, were very\nimpressive. During her\nrendition of \u201cHolding\nOut For A Hero\u201d, Moore\nwas given the chance to\nreally shine and display\nher undeniably amazing\nvoice. This is a song that\nthe audience had most\ndefinitely heard before\nbut I\u2019m sure many\nwould now pick Moore\u2019s\nversion as their favour-ite! Ren was probably\nthe hardest character\nto undertake. From the\ncomedic moments to\nemotional monologues,\nthis role required a huge\nacting range. Thankfully,Goldspink rose to\nthis challenge and gave\nan all-around strong\nperformance.\nThe show had a simple\nset which was vaguely\neffective at transporting\nthe characters around\nthe small town, from\nthe high school to the\nchurch to the diner and\nback home. There was a\nbig black block right in\nthe center of the stage\nwhich could have acted\nas the perfect blank\ncanvas to bring the set\nto a new level by adding\na bit of colour!\nFootloose is a show\nall about how dancing\ncan bring joy, yet a\nfew of the performers\ndidn\u2019t seem all that\njoyous when busting a\nmove. While most were\nconfidently selling the\nmusical theatre fantasy,\nsome didn\u2019t seem to be\ncommitting to the moves\nand brought down the\nrest of the group. This\nis such a small thing\nto fix but would really\nelevate the whole show\nand bring the ensemble\ndancing onto the same\nlevel as the amazing\nsinging. Overall this\nis another great performance from MTSoc\nwith some real talent on\nshow!\nThe upbeat numbers had the whole audience engaged, sharing in the joyous moment // Dingyu Lu\nTash Cowan\u2019s hilarious moment in the spotlight as the\ndiner owner Betty Blast // Dingyu Lu\nARTS\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Editor\nWhere?

It would\u2019ve been\na very small book, but\nthen gradually as I was\nworking on it, everything\nsuddenly changed - there\nwere lots of women presidents and women profes-sors. The book evolved\nfrom a monograph to now\nwith over 400 pages, and\nthere are still loads more\nthat could be said.\nFelix: What is the\npremise of the book?\nWhat is the message\nyou want to deliver?\nI went right back to\nthe nineteenth century\nbecause my premise is\nwomen have always been\nat Imperial. The theory\nhas always been that they\nhave not, but they have.\nIt\u2019s not part of the story\nthat was told. That could\nbe for a lot of reasons,\nwhich I didn\u2019t really go\nIn celebration of International Women\u2019s Day, Felix spoke with Anne about her book which\ndives into the women here at Imperial from the nineteenth century up until the present.\nAnne Barrett // Jenny Naldrett\nISSUE 1747\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\n\u201cTo me, biographies are\nthe most important thing,\ntelling the stories -- to tell\nthe history of the college in\nsuch a way that it encourages\nmore people to come here. It\nis for Imperial to have such a\nrecord about women because\nit is still perceived as a male-pre-dominant place.\ninto because I just wanted\nto state the facts with\nverification.\nFelix: The book\nincludes many details\nin regards to the\nwomen\u2019s lives here at\nImperial. What kind\nof archives did you\nrefer to obtain the\ninformation?\nWe have evidence that\nwomen were here from\nvarious letters, corre-spondence, and official\npapers. Say for Julia\nHiggins, she had done a\nrecording with the British\nLibrary about her life, and\nshe allowed me to use it.\nSo I particularly looked at\nthe transcript and got a lot\nof information from that.\nThere are also lots of\npublished documentation\nin regards to when the\npeople were here, like\nfellowships of Royal\nSociety. There\u2019s a wealth\nof information if you\nknow where to look for it\n- journals, Felix, Reporter,\nthe alumni magazine,\nminutes. We used to\nhave something called a\nCollege Calendar, which\nlisted people in the organ-isation. You could trace\nsomeone\u2019s career because\npeople were named in the\ndepartment, what their\nroles were, and how it\nchanged from a particular\ndate.\nFelix: In the book,\nthere\u2019s a section\non families here\nat Imperial which I\nfound particularly\ninteresting. How did\nthat come about?\nI like to draw things\ntogether, and there were\na lot of people, perhaps\nby chance, who ended\nup working together.\nThe Conrady family, for\nexample, the father was\nthe professor of optics.\nHe had four daughters,\nthree of whom went into\nscience. One of them\nstudied with him and\nwent into optical physics.\nShe married a fellow\nstudent; they then went\nto Rochester in New York\nand developed the optics\nthere. Two of the other\ndaughters did chemistry;\none taught for a bit and\ndid research.\nFelix: As you went\nthrough the history\nof women in Imperial,\ndid you notice a\npattern - a certain\nyear or time period\nwhere women\nbecame more preva-lent?\nI did not discern a\npattern, though there are\nstatistics from human re-sources. Obviously, in the\nlast few years, there has\nbeen a huge change with\nAlice Gast as president\nand more women as vice\nprovosts. We\u2019ve always\nhad women professors\nand lecturers, but it\u2019s more\nrecently that women have\ngained senior roles.\nFelix: Do you see the\ninclusivity of women\nas part of Imperial\u2019s\nvision? Is it for the\nuniversity to push for\ngreater involvement\nof women in STEM?\nOne of my arguments\nis that it goes way back. It\nstarts way back in school\n- universities can do so\nmuch. They can\u2019t change\nthe previous cultures; they\ncan encourage but they\ncan\u2019t change everything.\nIf the familiar attitude\nisn\u2019t good for women to\ndo science, then that\u2019s\nthe greatest struggle for a\nperson to have an interest\nin science. It\u2019s pre-univer-sity - it starts way back in\nsociety.\nFelix: What is the\nmost important part\nof the book to you\npersonally?\nTo me, the biographies\nare the most important\nthing, telling the stories\n- to encourage people\nto say \u201cthat\u2019s a similar\nbackground to me,\u201d or \u201cI\nreally want to do that.\u201d\nThat\u2019s my job - to tell the\nhistory of the college in\nsuch a way that it encourages more people to come\nhere. It\u2019s a great thing to\ndo; I\u2019m very privileged\nto have been able to do\nit. It is for Imperial to\nhave such a record about\nwomen because it is still\nperceived as a male-pre-dominant place.\nWomen at Imperial:\nPast, Present and Future\nis available for purchase\nat the Union Shop outside\nthe Sherfield walkway\ncurrently at \u00a335.\n\n"

This\nwas reflected in the shows\nimpressive casting of\nover 50 models who each\nbrought their own unique\npersonality and style to\nthe catwalk. Perfectly\nreflecting the imperative\nset out in the show\u2019s title.\nThe show\u2019s opening\nwalks set the tone for\nthe evening. It featured\nEdge of Beyond, a\nLondon-based body\ninclusive lingerie brand\nwho incorporate 24 karat\njewellery into their pieces.\nThe styling utilised\nsemi-transparent sheer\nt-shirts which were ripped\noff as part of the explosive\nchoreography to revel\nthe intricately made sus-penders, bras and thongs\nadorned with jewels and\nsequins. This moment saw\nan eruption of cheers from\nthe crowd. Cheers which\nwould keep on coming for\nthe remainder of the show.\nThe second walk saw\nmale and female models\ncome together on the\nstage in reworked denim\nand streetwear pieces The boys in Master Debonair // Zoha Imam\nfrom Pieces*. The most\nstriking items included\nasymmetrical paint drip\njeans in black and gold, an\nupdated and exciting take\non the Junya Wantanbe\nclassic. The closing walk\nfor the opening section\nof the show saw a significant mood change.\nModels were carried on\nto the stage in low light to\nepic atmospheric music.\nWhen the lights went up\ngarments from Charlotte\nPiers. The range of lycra\ntwo piece sets with lava,\nsunset and asymmetrical\nblock colour patterns\nfilled the crowd with\nexcitement and energy for\nsummer, the end of exams\nand festival season.\nA brief interval saw\nonly a slight relent in\nthe excitement from the\ncrowd as they headed\nto the bar to refresh and\nrecover from the realness.\nFollowing this, it was\nstraight back in with the\nboys looking sharp in\nMaster Debonair. The\naward-winning menswear\nbrand showed a range of\nfitted three-piece suits\nwith coordinated pocket\nsquares and ties. Although\nthis collection did little\nreinvention, aside from\nthe double-breasted\nwaistcoats; the walk was\nkept interesting with tight\nboy-band choreography\nwith an unexpected song\nswitch to Billie Eilish\u2019s\n\u2018Bad Guy\u2019. The next walk\nwas exactly the opposite.\nDemoo Jeans showed\na range of sustainable\nup-cycled jeans in all cuts:\nflared, straight and low\nwaisted. These were customised with sequin and\nembroidery detailing at\nthe cuffs styled and styled\nwith matching headbands.\nThe result was looks\nwhich straddled 70s disco\nfever and 2000s denim\nobsession. After this, a\nwalk with clothes from\nJaspreet Layal showed\na range of satin trouser\nsuits, dresses, tops and\nskirts adorned with metal\nfloral detailing. Before the\nmid-way interval, it was\ntime for the swimwear\nwalk. Oceanus swimsuits\nwith their geometric\npatterns, floral embroidery and asymmetrical\nshapes glowed underneath\nUV lights. The impressive\nsequin illustration of a\ncobra on the one of the\nswimsuits made this\na stand-out piece. For\nthe boys, Pink House\nMustique showed classic\nCalifornian boardshorts.\nEnding the swimwear\nwalk pool inflatables were\nlaunched into the crowd\nwhich would circulate\naround the audience\nand the catwalk for the\nremainder of the evening.\nFinally, the fourth-year\nwalk continued the beachwear vibe with clothes\nfrom Tom\u2019s Trunks. The\nbaggy cotton loungewear\nlooked ideal for long\nlibrary shifts, long-haul\nflights, and long lazy\nSundays.\nThe break was accompanied by a performance\nfrom Jazz Band, but the\nchoreographers didn\u2019t let\nthe crowd take a breath.\nFor the final song, we saw\nfour male models wearing\nbow ties and not much else\njoin the vocalist on stage\nfrom some impressive\nlifts and classy choreog-raphy. When we returned,\nthe impressive choreography kept coming with a\nvoguing inspired routine\nfor male models in heels\nand garments An Original\nLeroy. The tight neon\nspandex pants laden with\nanimal prints accompanied the brilliant routine\nperfectly. Following that,\nwe had a sensational\ncollection from Katherine J.W. who showed\nwindbreakers, bodysuits\nand other sportswear\nreworked to include\nnautical elements and\ncolours. These included\nprints of sailing maps,\nsafety orange lifejacket\nstraps and laser cut acrylic\nnecklaces, all inspired\nby her Grandfathers\nold sailing gear. Before\nBhangra took to the\nstage for a high-energy\ndance interval, we saw\nEl Velvet\u2019s collection of\nbold street and sportswear\nstaples.\nFollowing the interval,\nmodels were shown in\nClara Buchen\u2019s womens-wear which combined\nbright colours and\nneutral tones effortlessly\ninto a sustainable collec-tion. The combination\nof a cropped hot pink\njacket and pale pink skirt\ndefied logic to produce\na truly refreshing look.\nThis was followed by\nan equally impressive\nsustainable streetwear\ncollection from OKT,\nwhich combined\nKorean oversizing with\nLondon style codes. The\noutstanding finishing,\nshape and detailing of\nthe garments kept this\ncollection individual in\nan otherwise saturated\nstreetwear scene. Afterwards, the hosts for the\nevening\u2019s kept their cool\nand the crowd laughing\nthrough an awkward\nraffle mishap, in an otherwise flawless running\nof the night, before it was\ntime for closing lingerie\nand final walk. The\ninclusivity and diversity\nof Bluebella\u2019s luxury\nlingerie was used to the\nfullest. All the lingerie\nitems you would expect\nto see were updated with\nharnesses, straps and lace\ndetailing. Accompanying this was underwear\ndesigner Bocka Bocka,\nwhich boxers and briefs\nfeatured brightly coloured\nneon prints.\nClosing out the show\nwas, of course, the final\nwalkwhichfeaturedallthe\nmodels coming as they are\nto the end of the catwalk\nfor one final time to give\nus hilarious and personal\nposes to end the show.\nAfter the audience\u2019s long\napplause and the confetti\nfinished falling, I spoke to\none of the show\u2019s Creative\nDirectors, Teresa Lau. She\nsummed up what the show\nmeant to her and the team\nbehind it saying \u201cAll of\nthe hard work [had] paid\noff to see an audience so\nexcited about welcoming\nin a new decade where\nindividuality, inclusivity\nand diversity are set to be\ncentre stage.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Kyoto to Catwalk\nK\nimono: the\nJapanese word\nt r a n s l a t e s\nsimply as \u2018thing\nto wear\u2019, so ingrained is\nthe kimono in Japanese\nculture. Yet, from its origins in Edo-period Japan,\nthis simple garment has\ntravelled all around the\nworld. The V&A\u2019s new\nexhibition \u2013 the first major\nexhibition on kimono\nin Europe \u2013 provides a\nunique perspective on its\nglobal evolution, covering\na journey of almost four\nhundred years.\nWalking in, we are\ngreeted by a display\ncabinet holding three\nkimono. A closer look\nreveals the startling fact\nthat they are from three\nvery different eras and\napproaches: a traditional\nJapanese kimono from the\n17th century, a Dior haute\ncouture outfit from the\n2000s, and a modern-tra-ditional Japanese design\nfrom today. Remarkably,\nall are unmistakably\nkimono; one can see how\nthe kimono has fluidly\nadapted to the changing\nworld while remaining\nunchanged at its core.\nThe rest of the exhibition is structured along\nthe three major themes\nfrom the first display. We\nbegin at the origins of the\nkimono in 17th-century\nEdo Japan, the romantic\n\u2018floating world\u2019 where\nsamurai ruled, kabuki\ntheatre flourished, and\nstreets were filled with\nbeautiful geishas in extravagant kimono. Such\nis the world depicted in\nthe ukiyo-e woodblock\nprints and painted screens,\nwhich hang alongside\na dazzling array of\nEdo-period kimono. The\nextensive display explores\nthe changing tastes in\nEdo-period fashion over\ntwo hundred years. Much\nas today, celebrities and\nactors were trendsetters;\npeople scrambled to buy\nthe \u2018Ichimatsu check\u2019\npattern after the kabuki\nactor Sanogawa Ichimatsu wore it on stage.\nWith willing consumers\nforeign trade in the 1850s.\nThe trend was part of a\nwider public fascination\nwith \u2018the exotic Orient\u2019 \u2013\none that saw the creation\nof several Japanese-inspired operas and plays\nsuch as \u2018The Mikado\u2019 and\n\u2018The Geisha\u2019. Courtesy\nof the Dutch East India\nCompany (DEIC),\nJapanese kimono-makers\nproduced quilted kimonos\nand belted \u2018dressing\ngowns\u2019 specifically\nfor export to Europe.\nA traditional kimono\ncould be adapted into a\nEuropean dress by adding\na triangle of fabric to\ncreate a full skirt, with the\ntraditional obi becoming\na figure-hugging sash.\nPortraits and fashion\nplates from the period\ncertainly speak to the popularity of Japanese-style\ndress among wealthy\nVictorians. Is this cultural\nappropriation at its finest?\nThe exhibition is quick to\npoint out that the cultural\ninfluence was not uni-directional. When cloth\nfrom India was brought by\nthe DEIC to Japan to be\nmade into kimonos, these\nIndian patterns became\nfashionable in Japan itself,\nwith Japanese weavers\nadopting Indian textile\ndesigns (wa-sarasa).\nEuropean dress styles and\nEuropean ideals became\npopular in Japan with\nincreasing foreign travel\nand imports.An intriguing\npainting from 1935 shows\na young woman dressed\nin an elegant kimono\u2026\nwith a fox pelt draped\nincongruously around her\nneck. This period seems\nto reflect more a dialogue\nbetween two cultures than\nsimple \u2018appropriation\u2019.\nBringing us up to speed\nwith the modern day, the\nwide-ranging final section\ncovers the diverse range\nof forms and roles taken\non by the kimono today.\nIn modern haute couture,\nits elegance and clean\nlines have inspired both\nJapanese and non-Japa-nese designers alike, from\nAlexander McQueen to\nRei Kawakubo, who have\neach re-interpreted the\nclassic form. In music and\nfilm, the kimono has also\nfound its way to inspire\nartists: on display is the\noriginal costume worn by\nObi-Wan Kenobi as well\nas Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s \u2018multicultural\ngoddess\u2019 outfit in her\nalbum cover for Homogenic. In Japan, it remains a\npotent symbol of tradition\nand identity. However, far\nfrom being the everyday\nattire they were in the\nEdo period, kimono are\nnow generally worn in\nJapan only on a handful\nof formal or traditional\noccasions. It is a little sad\nthat these occasions are\nso infrequent that professional \u2018kimono-fitters\u2019 are\nneeded to teach people\nhow to wear kimonos\nproperly. But we end on a\nhopeful note, with an array\nof contemporary kimono\nand even a photo of a\nteenage girl in Harajuku\nturning a vintage kimono\ninto street fashion.\nMy only complaint is\nthat the exhibition is fairly\nstatic \u2013 by this time the\nsheer number of kimono\npassing before my eyes\nhave somewhat melded\ninto one. I can\u2019t help but\nwish for some more innovative ways of telling the\ntale, whether it be through\nmore interactivity in the\nexhibits or perhaps more\nvideos in addition to the\ntext descriptions.\nNonetheless, this\nexhibition provides a\ncomprehensive and fascinating perspective on the\nevolution of the kimono\nthrough time. A deceptively simple garment\n(pleasingly mathematical\nin construction), it is ev-er-changing in the forms\nit takes while retaining its\nquintessential elegance\nand beauty.\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020\n8\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Viv\u2019s day\ngoes from bad to worse\nas a buckle on her sole\npair of shoes breaks while\ntravelling to work, leaving\nher with only one shoe\nand the conundrum of\nreflects on the impact of\nhigh-stress city living,\nwith Viv exclaiming \u201cI\nnever knew how much\nthis city hurt me until\ntoday\u201d as she cradles her\nbleeding foot.\nThe production is\nwell-staged with a set\nincluding trees and\ncurtains lowered from the\nceiling, a retractable bed,\nand \u2013 central to the production \u2013 a treadmill that\nrelentlessly rotates and\nmaintains the momentum\nof the performance, while\nbringing the actors ever\ncloser to the edge (of\nthe stage). Two sets of\nstairs emerging from the\nstage allow stagehands to\nseamlessly transition from\nscene to scene during the\n65-minute performance\nwith no intervals.\nElements of Shoe Lady\nbring to mind parallels\nof Tennesse Williams\u2019\nhandling of tragedy for\nthe middle-class But these\nare interspersed with\nunnecessary repetition\nand clumsy comedy,\nwhich gives the play a\nconfused and frenzied\ntone. Hopping from a\nhouse-viewing with\ntalking curtains to a police\nstation, and from Russell\n& Bromley to Viv\u2019s office\nbathroom as she takes the\nshoes from a coworker\nusing the toilet, the\naudience is left laughing\nwith uncertainty in places.\nParkinson delivers an\nadmirable performance,\nwhich is fully believable\nand reminiscent of an\nadult Alice in Wonderland\nwandering through the\nstreets of London.\nA very special, Special Relationship\nW\nhen you\nthink dep o r t a t i o n\nfrom the US\nand ICE, the notorious\nimmigration enforcement\nagency, you are probably\nmost likely to jump to\nthoughts of caged South\nAmerican migrant chil-dren, or the increasing\nefforts of the current\nadministration to deport\nanyone and everyone it\ncan find. However, in an\ninternational environment\nthat is increasingly hostile\nto foreigners of all creeds\nand nationalities, The\nSpecial Relationship is\nthe story of 6 US residents\nwith British citizenship\nthat, with varying degrees\nof culpability, have fallen\nafoul of the American\nlegal system and been\ndeported.\nThe characters represent a diverse cross\nsection of society, a\nmother who fakes cheques\nto get by, a meth addict, a\ndrunk driver, a concerned\nfather, a cocaine trucker\nfor the Mexican mafia\nand a convicted murderer,\neach based on interviews\nwith people that really had\nthese experiences. Each\ntells their tale, sometimes\ntragic, often comic with\nthe shadow of Curtis, an\nICE agent that haunts\neach of their stories. For\nthose of you unaware, ICE\nis the Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement\n(ICE) of the USA. Curtis,\nplayed by the exquisitely\ncast Nicholas Beveney,\nlooms over each of the\ncharacter\u2019s stories as they\ndevelop from infraction to\nsentencing to deportation,\nin a set of tales that would\nbe harrowing and tragic\nif they weren\u2019t broken\nup by perfectly comedic\ninterludes.\nTrump and May, then\nTrump and Johnson,\nslowdance their way\naround the stage, exactly\nmimicked by the highly\ntalented Duncan Wisbey,\nadding a peculiar level of\nlightness and hilarity to a\nplay that would otherwise\nbe difficult to watch\nwithout breaking down\ninto tears. The musical\nand comic interludes are\nperfectly timed, with\nenough biting satire and\ncunning wit to fuel a room\nfull of Mock the Week\nPanelists, pre-departure of\nFrankie Boyle obviously.\nAll joking aside of\ncourse, this is an excellent production that I\nleft feeling entertained,\ninformed and above all\nreflective. Immigration\nand deportation is one of\nthose tricky, emotionally\ncharged issues that we\nface in the modern day\nthat it can be hard to have\nan enlightened conversation about. However, this\nproduction handled such a\nsensitive topic incredibly\nwell, using the testimony\nof real people to develop\none of the best plays I\nhave seen with nuance\nand honesty. This is\nsomething we absolutely\nhave to talk about. In the\nwords of Curtis, \u201cthere\nwill always be a home for\nimmigration.\u201d\nOne less shoe to worry about // Katherine Parkinson\nISSUE 1747\nFELIX\n11\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCharlie Titmuss\nComments Editor\nWhere?

In\nthis double bill with his\nacclaimed one-act thrill-er, Kompromat, Spy\nPlays introduces David\nThame\u2019s latest creation:\nLondon/Budapest. Set\nin a Pimlico flat in\n1955 London, London/\nBudapest features Adam\nde Hegedus (Guy Warren\nThomas) the elusive\nauthor of Britain\u2019s first\ngay bestseller. Adam is\njoined in his flat by a\nRoyal Airforce Officer\n(Max Rinehart), whom\nhe had invited over after\na Sunday afternoon\nencounter at the Jermyn\nStreet baths.\nAdam de Hegedus\nsteals the show, particularly in the first\nhalf, delivering a\nconvincing depiction\nof the Hungarian gay\nnovelist \u2014 conveying\nhis wit, campness,\nand obvious desire\nto return to his more\nlavish and high-status\npast, in a very natural\nway. Despite the rather\nforceful, and entirely\nuncomfortable, rendition of oral sex between\nthe pair, one cannot help\nbut become enthralled in\nthe story as it unravels.\nThe venue itself is very\nintimate; the smell of\nstruck matchsticks on\nstage and the rumbling\nof trains overhead only\nadds to the atmospheric\nnature of the play. The\nset depicts exactly what\nyou would expect of\nAdam\u2019s 1950s flat, a\ncomfortable but by no\nmeans well-off author\u2019s\nattempt to convey some\nsemblance of luxury.\nMax Rinehart comes\ninto his own during\nthe second play of the\nevening, enacting the\nmysterious and, at times,\nsinister rent boy Zac. He\neasily conveys charm\nand slickness in his\ndialogue, adding depth\nin his monologues when\nhe considers his future\nand where the path of\nhedonism has left him.\nGuy Warren Thomas\nplays the intelligent\nbut socially awkward\nquantum cryptographer\nTom, on secondment to\nMI6 from GCHQ \u2014 the\ncharacter and story\nhaving been loosely\nplay down. The 2010\nincarnation of the same\nPimlico flat is grey and\nminimalist, garnished\nwith an Ikea table\nyou\u2019ve seen a thousand\ntimes before.\nLighting is more\ndirectly used in Kompromat, with the floor\nto ceiling windows\n(well, lights) visualising\nthe passage of photons\nthrough the glass\nwhilst Tom explains the\nconcept of wave-particle\nduality to a perplexed\naudience. The uncertain nature of quantum\nparticles is mirrored by\nZac\u2019s state of mind: as\nquantum particles must\ndecide on their state\nwhen observed, so Zac\nmust act under the watch\nof two Hungarian thugs\nbeyond the glass.\nWhilst the plays hold\nthe audience\u2019s attention\nand ultimately deliver\na satisfying conclusion,\nthere are points of\nlacklustre dialogue and\nawkward interactions. It\nis a production to go and\nsee if you are carried\naway with stories of\ngay spies and intriguing\nmysteries, but it will fail\nto deliver as an edge-of-your-seat thriller.\nDavid Thame must be\napplauded for his uncompromising portrayal\nof the enigmatic deaths\nof two spies, but one\ncan\u2019t help but feel as\nthough the show were\ncarried by the actors\nfor prolonged moments.\nPlaying in their roles\nuntil the 29th March,\nGuy Warren Thomas\nand Max Rinehart are\nworth visiting, though\nI would leave any lofty\nexpectations at the door.\nThe stars of London/Budapest grip audiences with intense dialogue and thoughtful portrayals // Tom McGregor\n\u201cThe smell\nof struck\nmatchsticks\non stage and\nthe rumbling\nof trains above\nadded to the\natmospheric\nnature of the\nplay\u201d\nMax Rinehart offers an intimate reflection on the life\nof Zac in Kompromat // Tom McGregor\nDavid Thame offers an uncompromising depiction of a\nmysterious death in Pimlico, in Kompromat\n// Tom McGregor\nARTS\nAlex Jackson\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "One Jewish Boy!\nI\nt is always challenging to construct a two\nperson play addressing social issues. In\nsuch cases there is a very\nfine line between organic\nexploration of intense\nthemes and a unilateral\nexposition of arguments\nby the characters; and\nit is quite easy to foray\ninto the latter territory\nunintentionally. Thus, it is\nparticularly charming to\nfind a play that manages\nto achieve this quite won-derfully, with a carefully\nbalanced critique of complex social themes, which\nin this case is inherited\ntrauma and anti-semitism.\nStephen Laughton\u2019s\nOne Jewish Boy, is a play\nexploring the domestic\nand personal consequences of anti-semitism in\nsociety (both overt and\nsubtle); It does this by\ntransporting us into the\nworld of Jesse (Robert\nNeumark-Jones) and Alex\n(Asha Reid). Jesse is a\nnorth London Jewish boy\nwho is forever traumatised\nby the relentless anti-sem-itism he has faced over the\nyears and is unable to look\nat the world optimistical-ly. Alex on the other hand\nis mixed race, and though\nhaving faced her fair share\nof racism over the years,\nstruggles to understand\nJesse\u2019s unique anguish.\nThrough these two\ncharacters Laughton\nwithin a span of 90\nminutes, manages to craft\nnarratives that address\nwell beyond the conventional tropes of anti-sem-itism, addressing racism,\nwhite privilege, religious\npolitics and identity crisis.\nThe play follows a\nnon-linear structure of\nstorytelling, starting off\nwith modern day Alex and\nJesse who are considering\ndivorce. From there on the\nplay moves in between\nthe years reflecting on\nthe different moments of\nconflict in their lives, and\nhow anti-semitism and\nthe subtle baggage that it\nbrings are chief contributors to this. One of the\nkey highlights of the play\nis how it craftily manages\nto capture character\nflaws, particularly on how\nvictims of racism may\nsubconsciously be racist\nthemselves.\nNo where else is this\ndichotomy better presented than in Jesse who\nconstantly seeks to define\nthe world around him\nbased on his experiences.\nJesse\u2019s call to be seen\nas more than a Jewish\nperson is immediately\ncontrasted by this behaviour to judge all around,\nwilfully painting people\nin broad and sometimes\nracist strokes. Alex complements this by taking\na more objective view\nof the events and offers\na middling perspective\nreflecting at times perhaps\nthe audiences view. In\nthis way the exchanges\nbetween the characters\nseem real, and translate to\nhonest discussion, rather\nthan reflecting the writers/\ndirectors opinions.\nThe non-linear narrative structure helped\ngreatly in unfolding key\nmoments without revealing the suspense in the\nstory. However the segues\nbetween these acts seemed\nindulgent and at times.\nincoherent. Reid and Neumark-Jones give honest\nand convincing perfor-mances. The minimalist\nset design works well\nwithin this production but\none is left wondering how\nwell the script might have\nworked had it received the\nfull treatment.\nRacism is a vicious\nbeast, one that is uniquely\ndifficult to articulate\nand communicate. It\u2019s\ncommendable that the\nplay with its limited cast\nmanages to achieve this in\na non-trivial manner. It\u2019s\ndefinitely worth a watch;\nor two - particularly if\nyou are one of those\nthat believe that modern\nracism is harmless.\nCan I Help You?\nC\nan I Help You?\ntells the story\nof a night in the\nlives of Francis\nand Fifi. The play starts\nwith Francis, a police of-ficer, standing at Beachy\nHead after work about to\ncommit suicide when he\nmeets a Ghanian woman\nnamed Fifi with a cat in a\nbox and a laundry bag.\nJim Pope brilliantly\nbrings to life Philip\nOsment\u2019s last play,\nstanding out mostly for\nthe contrast between its\nhumorous and emotional\nscenes. The humour\nmainly comes from the\nclash of Fifi\u2019s positive,\nnonsensical attitude with\nFrancis\u2019s cynical outlook.\nThere are also many\nridiculous elements such\nas the cat named Kat or\nFifi\u2019s continuous interruptions to feed the cop.\nThe emotional scenes are\nmore abundant during\nthe flashbacks, showing\nthe toughest moments of\na suffering mother and a\nwounded son.\nThe set design is\nminimal. It consists of a\nslope and the two actors\nonly have a few essential\nprops. This comes in\nuseful with the flashbacks\nas the audience doesn\u2019t\nassociate the stage with\na particular setting. The\nslope represents multiple\nplaces including Beachy\nHead both now and in the\npast, the house Francis\nused to live in, the airport\nand more. With less to\nprocess visually, the play\ndraws the audience\u2019s\nattention to the dialogues,\nacting and sound effects.\nThe acting is outstand-ing. Ganriel Vick and\nSusanAderin both manage\nto play multiple roles\ndistinctly. Vick mainly\nplays Francis and Michel,\nFifi\u2019s Son, and Aderin\nplays Fifi and Fiona,\nMichel\u2019s Mother. The\ninstantaneous changes in\ntheir attitudes and voice\nis exceptional, taking us\nto different scenarios and\ntimes in their lives in a\nvery effortless way.\nUltimately, \u2018Can I Help\nYou?\u2019 is the story of two\nhurt individuals who meet\neach other by pure chance\nand find hope together. A\nwonderful play to recall\nthe importance of support\nand remind us that\nhowever different we may\nbe, we can always relate\nand be understanding\nwith others.\nInnocent Love // Pamela Raith\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020\n10\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nAya Hayakawa and\nLaura Casas\nArts Writers\nWhere?

A man of many\nmonikers, Archy\u2019s releases under King Krule have\nbeen his most critically\nacclaimed. Man Alive!\nis King Krule\u2019s third\nalbum, following 2013\u2019s\n6 Feet Beneath the Moon\nand 2017\u2019s The Ooz.\nBoth of those previous\nprojects were outstanding\ndisplays of his artistic\nability, bodies of work\nthat listeners have formed\nan intimate relationship\nwith. 6 Feet Beneath the\nMoon, one of my personal\nfavourite albums, was an\nentirely raw, vulnerable\nand angst-ridden expression for despondent youth.\nThe Ooz on the other\nhand, though similarly\nbleak, traded rawness\nfor richness. The malaise\nwas presented through\na sonically dynamic,\nthematically expansive\nand lyrically dense and\npoetic lens \u2013 a literal\noozing of inner sludge\ninto new corners and\ndepths. This album, on the\nwhole, lies somewhere\nin between, more opaque\nand unyielding than\nanything King Krule has\ndone as of yet, despite still\nwearing its isolation and\nemotional potency on its\nsleeve. King Krule paints\nwith abstruse, anecdotal\nstrokes this time, his typically abstract motifs and\nimagery serving as snapshots rather than heady\nsketches.\nThe opening track,\nthree tracks is immediately urgent, riotous. When\nasked about \u2018Supermache\u2019, Archie stated that\nsupermarkets serve as a\nrich source of inspiration\ndue to the heightened\nsocietalcontiguityofover-hearing propaganda-in-fluenced conversations\nwhilst deciding which\nmass-produced products\nare most conducive to\none\u2019s physical sustenance.\nIndeed, futile attempts\nat environmentally conscious consumption is\nadded, on this album, to\nthe arsenal of references\nthat form King Krule\u2019s\nvivid, esoteric world \u2013\ntrack, adding to the\nlucid, confrontational\natmosphere created by\nthe teasing, hop-scotching\nbass, drilling electric\nguitar and contorting sax.\nThe track is a fitting companion to the one before,\n\u2018Stoned Again\u2019, where\ndrunk drums coated in\ndusty reverb evoke a deep\ninternal storm that brews\npersistently, exploding on\nthe chorus. In his loose,\nfreestyled verses, Archie\nconveys the frustrating\ninevitability of his weed\ndependence.\nThe album takes a\nmellow turn after this.\nFollowing the naked,\ngrieved on \u2018Has This\nHit?\u2019. On \u2018Slinky\u2019, which\ntransitions seamlessly\nfrom \u2018Alone, Omen 3\u2019,\nArchie elaborates on his\nfear of isolation with\nsome of the most heartfelt lyrics of the album,\npresenting a caveat to his\nmore optimistic outlook\non depression: \u201cBruising\non my right side feels so\n/ With thoughts of her\ndisplacement\u201d. \u2018(Don\u2019t\nLet The Dragon) Draag\nOn\u2019 a couple tracks later\nfeels like a direct response\nto \u2018Alone, Omen 3\u2019 and\n\u2018Slinky\u2019: an immersive,\nlanguid dive into the\nmotions of depression\nrather than a reassuring\nrumination on it. Its stale,\nsardonic grip haunts in the\nlyrics, as Archie describes\na room \u201cbathed in grey\u201d\nwhere the \u201cwalls get\ntaller\u201d.\nA delicate, meditative\nmoment, \u2018Airport Antenatal Airplane\u2019 presents the\nmost direct reflection on\nArchie\u2019s initiation to fa-therhood, the anticipation\nfor which influenced his\nheadspace when recording much of the album. A\nwarm, weighted texture is\ncreated by the thick guitar\nplucks and soft, shuffling,\nstaccato drums paired with\nthe remixed, chopped and\nglued sample of singer\nNil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s ethereal,\nladen voice. \u2018Underclass\u2019\ntakes a similarly personal\napproach with Archie\u2019s\nattention this time focused\non his partner. Following\nthe same formula as a few\nother tracks on the album,\na soft, desolate instrumental hovers diffuse, before\nbeing brought to the foreground by a singing sax.\nHe reflects on anxiety\u2019s\nrole in his relationship, its\npersistent attempt to push\nagainst intimacy and lend\ndoubt to his experience\nof affection. He describes\nthis mind state, the place\nhe was in when he met his\npartner, as being \u201cUnder\nthe underclass / Deep in\nsociety\u2019s hole\u201d. Implying\na fear of returning to that\nplace, he repeats \u201cBut\nlittle did I know\u201d, perhaps\nsuggesting that the unexpected pregnancy caused\na welcome rerouting of\nhis mind\u2019s trajectory.\nHe elaborates on this\nsentiment on \u2018Please\nComplete Thee\u2019, the\nlast track of the album,\noffering himself wholly\nto his partner, \u201cPlease\ncomplete me / It must be\nthe answer\u201d. Far from\na romantic gesture, the\nsong is a plea over a bare\ninstrumental. In a time of\nincreasing humanitarian\ntragedy and political an-tagonising, Archie\u2019s true\nsentiment when he is done\ntaking inspiration from\nthe chaos of it all in supermarkets and in parks is\nrelatable disillusionment:\n\u201cEverything just seems to\nbe numbness around\u201d. His\nburning desire to be with\nloved ones at a time like\nnow is existential: \u201cHave\nyou seen the disasters?\n/ We don\u2019t have long \u2018til\nthis earth is drowned\u201d.\nIn places, Man Alive!\u2019s\nlyrics only create the\nfa\u00e7ade of abstract poetry,\nwhen they really serve\nto lend an aesthetic, or\njust sound cool. In \u2018The\nDream\u2019, a redundant\nsoundscape interlude\nbetween the upbeat and\nmore atmospheric tracks,\nthe lullabied, \u201cStop\nmaking sense of things\u201d\ncomes across as an excuse\nfor the album\u2019s consistent\nlyrical elusiveness. The\ntrack also exemplifies the\nalbum\u2019s tendency to sonic\nfogginess, which hinges\non tiresome during the last\nfew tracks upon repeat\nlistens. Though its predecessors are therefore more\nlistenable and will likely\nprove more enduring than\nMan Alive!, the album is a\nwelcome addition to King\nKrule\u2019s unique discogra-phy.\nAn M with the legs and an A with the hand // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Editor\nArtist: King Krule.

The former\nrecounts, through some\nof the most coded lyrics\nof the album, a cycle of\nwaking up with delinquent\ncompany in Peckham\nRye, messy and injured\nfrom the previous night\u2019s\nevents that now feel like a\n\u201cpast life\u201d. Sped-up vocals\nfrom the Otis Redding\ndrum break sample are\nlooped throughout the\nsobering expression of\nisolation on \u2018Perfecto Miserabl\u00e9\u2019, \u2018Alone, Omen 3\u2019\noffers a beautiful moment\ndedicated to navigating a\ndepressive period. \u201cThe\nache and thunder in the\nstorms of your mind /\nSoak it in, for the rain\nwill pass in time,\u201d Archie\nadvises, acknowledging\nthat as much meaning\ncan be found in the pain,\ntribulations and hatred of\nlife as in the happiness,\nblessings and love. This\nrepresents a shift from his\n6 Feet Beneath the Moon\ndays: \u201cI know when I\nlook into the sky / There\nis no meaning,\u201d he once\n\u201cKing Krule\npaints with\nabstruse,\nanecdotal\nstrokes\nthis time...\nsnapshots\nrather than\nheady\nsketches\u201d\n\u2018Cellular\u2019, is one of the\nalbum\u2019s best. Disillusioned acoustic guitar\nlicks underpin efferves-cent, teetering digital\nsound effects that skirt\naround punching drums.\nThe lyrics touch on the\ndigitalisation of emotion\nand the desensitizing\neffect that has on our\nreception to tragic news,\na theme mirrored in one\nof the album\u2019s later tracks\n\u2013 \u2018Theme for the Cross\u2019.\nThe narration on \u2018Cellular\u2019\nloosely describes a\ntelephone conversation\nduring a train journey,\nwhich perhaps represents\nArchy\u2019s mental state, and\nhis loss of connection to\nthe world when it goes\nunder: \u201cBelow the ground\nfloor / We\u2019re losing signal,\nwe\u2019ve lost connection\u201d.\nWe\u2019re pointed to the\nalienating and often terrifying situation of being\n\u201cAbandoned to the voice\nin my head\u201d, where we\nbecome our worst selves,\nwhere we feel a primal\ndesire to be loved, as\nArchie\u2019s unhinged, cre-scendoing chant conveys\non the outro: \u201cI phone my\nex.\u201d\nThe energy of the next\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial Smash the 2020 European Duathlon\nChampionships\nSPORTS\nMatthew Ryan\nSports Writer\nO\nn Saturday\nthe 7th March\n2020, Imperial\nStudents Henry\nHart and Matt Ryan represented Great Britain\u2019s\nage-group teams in Punta\nUmbria, Spain for the\nETU European Duathlon\nChampionships 2020.\nHaving qualified for\nthis event at Bedford Autodrome in March 2019\nbattling 40 mph winds,\nrain and temperatures just\nabove zero, to be travelling out to the beach resort\ntown of Punta Umbria in\nSouth-West Spain was a\npleasant contrast\nThe race was a familiar\nsprint distance format, a\n4.8km run, followed by a\n20.4km draft-legal cycle\nand finally an additional\n2.8km run to the finish\nline. Competing against\nthe rest of Europe\u2019s\nage-groupers, aged 16 to\n85 and almost 500 athletes\nentered for the Sprint\ndistance race.\nHenry and Matt were\nboth racing in the first\nwave, consisting of all the\n16-19, 20-24 and 25-29\nyear old males\u2013 this was\nthe firm favourite for an\noverall champion. At\n0900, the competitors\nwere lined up and ready to\nstrike. With hundreds of\nsupporters lining the route\nfrom all over Europe,\nwaving national flags, the\ntension was palpable.\nWith a blast of the\nstart horn, the athletes\nrushed down the starting\nfunnel, only for disaster\nto strike less than 4 strides\ninto the race. Another\nGB athlete tripped in the\nfight for positions and\nwent down to the ground\ncausing a pileup of around\n6 athletes, which Hart\nmanaged to jump straight\nover. Unfortunately for\nRyan, he did not react\nin time, and went down\nalong with a few Spanish\nathletes and an Irish repre-sentative, hitting his right\nknee hard on the tarmac\nbefore picking himself\nback up at the rear of the\npack.\nHenry assumed his\nposition at the front of the\nrace. As Cross-Country\nclub captain, and outstanding runner, this was\nexactly what he wanted.\nCompleting the first\n4.8km in 14 minutes and\n48 seconds, finishing at\nthe head of the race with\nthe second fastest run time\nof the whole competition;\nall without using those\npesky Vaporflys that keep\npopping up in races.\nMatt initially struggling\nwith the freshly sustained\ninjury pushed on until\nadrenaline and hate began\nto mask the pain, fighting\nthrough the pack to finish\nin 15 minutes and 56\nseconds.\nOn to the bike, where\nHenry quickly found his\nplace amongst the two\nother strongest runners\nand settled into a routine\nof taking turns on the front\nwith the pair of Spaniards\nto maintain their lead.\nMeanwhile, Matt (feeling\nmore comfortable in Multisport events than running\nraces) blitzed through\ntransition to catch up\nwith previous age-group\nchampion and fellow Brit\n\u2013 David Pearson. Matt\nand Pearson working with\nFelix Wernham formed a\nthree-man, British cycling\nmachine to push through\nthe sea of Spanish, Irish\nand Portuguese athletes\nbetween them and the\nfront pack. These three\nBrits working in unison\ntaking turns on point\nproduced the fastest bike\ntime of the whole compe-tition, completing 20.4km\nin 29:48, gaining almost\n45 seconds on the leaders,\nlanding Matt in 4th at\nthe end of the bike, with\nHenry still in 1st place\nupon leaving T2.\nThis left only the\nfinal 2.8km run to go,\nwhere Henry could again\nunleash his full potential\nas a runner, and finish the\nwhole race in 55 minutes\nand 12 seconds, scoring\n3rd overall in Europe,\nwinner of the 20-24\ncategory, and fastest Brit\nat the event. Crossing the\nfinish line Henry hardly\nseemed elated, perhaps\ndistracted by the thought\nof a finish line beer.\nMatt meanwhile began\nthe second run with some\ndifficulty, as his knee had\nbegun to swell from the\nearlier injury. During this\nfinal leg, Ryan dropped\nback from 4th overall in\nEurope to 6th in the 20-24\nage group.\nHenry Hart\u2019s debut at\na Multisport Championship could not have gone\nbetter, landing him the\npotential to race alongside\ngiants such as Brownlee\nand Potter in next year\u2019s\nelite race. A monumental\neffort in anyone\u2019s books,\nlet alone somebody who\nprofesses to despise\ncycling. Meanwhile Matt,\nwith a knee now double\nits initial size and an array\nof strange colours, also\nfelt the need to celebrate\nwith vast quantities of\nalcohol, and boy did we,\nor so we\u2019ve been told\nby the rest of Team GB\nwho witnessed it\u2026 Spain\nwas too hot for clothes\nanyway.\nHart and Ryan both put in stellar performances // Budiyofoto Centre - Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Triatl\u00f3n\nISSUE 1747\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40\nTwo Imperial students represented Great Britain in Spain last week, one of which was the fastest Brit at the event\n\u201cHenry Hart\u2019s\ndebut at a\nMultisport\nChampionship\ncould not have\ngone better\u201d\n\n"

It\nrenders the policy useless\nand nothing more than\ngreenwashing.\u201d Solvejg\ncontinued to point out that\nthe policy specifies that\nCollege would divest from\nillegal arms: \u201cI would sure\nhope that that was never\nthe case to start with, as\nthe university investing\nin something illegal is a\ndeeply troubling concept.\u201d\nIn her eyes, the SRI\nPolicy is an \u201cinadequate\nresponse\u201d and that\u2019s why\nthe students have chosen\nto escalate their actions to\nan occupation.\nWhen asked about the\nresponse that occupying\nstudents received, Solvejg\nnoted that security hadn\u2019t\nintervened, \u201cwhich is\nfantastic, but it\u2019s almost\nlike we aren\u2019t being taken\nseriously yet.\u201d\nAnother student, Stephanie, echoed those words:\n\u201cSome security staff have\nspecifically said they are\nsupportive of the action\u2026\nand we aren\u2019t here to\ndisrupt them, we are here\nto disrupt senior management\u201d. Stephanie said she\nhad been involved with\norganising the occupation\nas part of Extinction\nRebellion Universities\nfor \u201cmonths\u201d and emphasised the importance of\nlogistics when planning\nan action like this. \u201cThe\nfirst thing is the safety of\nthe people involved\u2026 we\nneed to think about, do we\nhave the training and the\ntactics in place to be able\nto handle the worst case\nscenario and de-escalate\nsituations? You have to\nalso be really clear about\nwhat your aim is\u201d\nAt the information\nstall, curious students had\ncome up to speak to protestors and find out what\nwas going on. \u201cIt\u2019s good\nto see people standing up\nfor something this important,\u201d said Surya Sridharan, a medicine student\npassing by. On Alice Gast,\nSurya said \u201cIt\u2019s important\nto have people who don\u2019t\nhave bias when it comes\nto decisions that affect\neverybody.\u201d\nAnother student,\nSohaib Zia, said \u201cI find\nthat very questionable\u2026\nI\u2019m not a big fan of\nhaving someone in a place\nof power with strong links\nto an industry like that.\u201d\nWhen asked about the\nstudents\u2019 five day occu-pation, he said he felt it\nThe main entrance to the College has been occupied this week by student activists protesting against Imperial's\nongoing investment into fossil fuels and their \"greenwashing\" new Socially Responsible Investment policy\nchairs and tables lying\naround the Main Entrance\nfoyer to carve out a space\nfor themselves, using\nbanners and placards to\ndemarcate the space they\nwere occupying. The\nmost visible banner was\nright next to the revolving\ndoors, which meant that\nall people would see the\nwords \u201cImperial, Stop\nGreenwashing!\u201d upon\nentering the College.\nA timetable of events\nhad been devised and\ndisplayed around the\noccupied space, featuring\nevents such as \u2018indigenous film screenings\u2019, and\ndiscussions on climate\nrefugees and neocolonial-ism. The occupation also\nfeatured a manned stall\nwith information on the\nprotest and Imperial\u2019s in-vestments, where students\ncould come and learn\nabout what was going on.\nOn Tuesday, Felix\nvisited the occupation\nand interviewed activists\ninvolved with the occupa-tion.\n\u201cThere are loopholes in\nthe College\u2019s new Socially\nResponsible Investment\nPolicy,\u201d said Solvejg\nSoll-Lauritzen, a sec-ond-year chemist involved\nwith the occupation, \u201cthat\nThe occupiers have used several artistic pieces to raise complaint // Frankie Roberts\nThe march blocked off roads despite persistent London commuters // Frankie Roberts\n\n"

    "content": "Daughter: Toxic Masculinity at its Darkest\nA\ns the lights fade\nto black on\nAdam Lazarus,\nthe star and\nco-creator of Daughter,\na one-man performance\nexploring toxic masculin-ity, there was an audible\nexhale from the back au-dience. I was surprised to\nfind that it wasn\u2019t my own\nsigh owing to the sheer\nrelief that I felt that the\nplay had finally come to\na close. Am I suggesting\nI didn\u2019t enjoy the play?\nIndisputably, I did not\nenjoy the play. Would I\nrecommend it to a friend?\nAbsolutely.\nThrough 70 minutes\nof captivating acting,\nLazarus takes us on the\nlong, sometimes despica-ble, sometimes disgusting,\njourney of a 30-something\nyear-old father who struggles to come to grips with\nthe reality of fathering a\ndaughter. We are guided\nfrom the very beginning\nby Lazarus\u2019s self-centred\napproach to life, with\nLazarus preparing to take\nhis wife to the hospital for\nthe birth of their daughter;\neven at this stage seeds\nof self-intoxication are\nsewn as he speaks of the\nmattress he\u2019s made sure to\npack (in case he becomes\ntired of waiting around\nfor his wife to birth their\nfirst born child). We move\nthrough the play exploring the more grotesque\ndetails of his life. The\nlightest moment being\nwhen a sleep deprived\nAdam couldn\u2019t bear\nhis daughter\u2019s constant\ngetting out of bed any\nlonger and so took matters\ninto his own hands to\nforcibly put her back into\nbed. The audience at this\nstage, who were invited\nto give an opinion on this,\nwere sympathetic to his\nbehaviour. However, as\nwe journey on, actions\nbecome more unforgiv-able, with an affair with a\n16-year-old and hitting a\nguest over the head with a\nbaseball bat.\nAfter the play, during\na question and answer\nsession hosted by fellow\nco-creator Aislinn Rose,\nit is explained that the\nplay is based on the style\nof Bouffon; a style of\nperformance which aims\nto highlight and mock\nthe flaws of its audience.\nWith that explanation\nunder my belt, my initial\nfeelings of disgust and\ndiscomfort turned into\na more productive and\njustified anger. I left, for\nthe first time in my life,\nwanting to possess the\nsupernatural power of\nmind reading, just so that\nI could peer into a man\u2019s\nhead to see if it really was\nas horrendous as Lazarus\ndescribed. I suspect, like\nwith most things I would\nfind a spectrum of results.\nDaughter brutally highlights the darkest corners\nof what can be found in\nsociety and beautifully\nprovides a platform to\ndiscuss the monster that is\ntoxic masculinity. For that\nI thank it.\nThe Revenger\u2019s Tragedy\nS\nilence. Darkness.\nThe word\nVENDETTA ap-pears, illuminated\nsuddenly by searing stage\nlights. A troupe of smartly\ndressed actors who look\nlike they might be on the\nway to a formal soiree\nmove and shake to a jazzy\ntune, rather carelessly and\nunabashedly as if guided\nby an invisible puppet\nmaster tugging at strings\nbound to their limbs, as\nthey circle the stage.\nThis is a modern\nItalian production, a\ntranslation courtesy of\nStefano Massini, of the\nclassic play The Revenger\u2019s Tragedy (now La\nTragedia del Vendicatore), widely attributed to\nthe Jacobean playwright\nson and heir Lussurioso\n(Ivan Alovisio), aided\nby his brother Hippolito\n(Raffaele Esposito).\nDirector Declan\nDonnellan paints a vivid,\nmodernised picture of\nthe classic Italian court,\nwhere a twisting plot full\nto the brim with corruption and revenge begins\nto unfold with Shakespearean confusion. The\nproduction takes place on\na minimalistic set consisting mostly of a panelled\nwood frame backdrop that\npartially gives way to a\nprojector screen, showing\nmostly a single image\ntelling us where we are.\nSometimes this image is a\nblack and white, real-time\nfeed from a professional\nvideo camera held by one\nof the actors that flashes\nmonochrome closeups\nat us in a grainy fashion,\nsometimes the images are\nin gristly detail.\nDespite the production\nbeing entirely in Italian,\nit is not difficult to follow\nthe plot, aided by some\nto the dynamism of the\nactors, who exhibit passionate fervour in their\non-stage antics, making\ntheir intentions clear. A\nbrilliant example is the\nway in which the temptress stepmother of the\nDuke\u2019s sons, the Duchess,\nGratiana (Pia Lanciotti),\nexhibits her theatrical\npleas for mercy, or her humorously sultry displays\nfor the alleged bastard\nson of the Duke, Spurio\n(Errico Liguori). Such\ntouches add to the at times\nlight, at others very dark\nhumour and pure absurdity that pervade the play\nand the production. This\nabsurdity is spotlighted\nby the modernity. Indeed,\nthere was one particularly\namusing moment when\ntwo of the Duke\u2019s sons lay\non the ground, while the\nyounger uses the elder\u2019s\nvape as an asthma pump\nto try to calm him down.\nAll in all, the actors,\ndirector, and production\nteam put on a fast paced,\nfluid performance which\nhas brought a classic play\ninto modern day Italy.\nThis performance has\nhighlighted the fact that\ndespite hundreds of years\nof human experience,\nstories of corruption and\nfeelings of anguish for\nwrongs done by those\nin power are still just as\nrelevant.\nAn exploration into the male mind// Murdo Macleod\nISSUE 1747\nFELIX\n13\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nPoppy Hayes\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Balenciaga-theboywhowouldbetheKing(ofcouture)\nW\nho was\nC r i s t \u00f3 b a l\nBalenciaga?\nHe was\nborn to Jos\u00e9 Balenciaga,\na simple fisherman, and\nto Martina Eizaguirre, a\nhumble seamstress, in the\nmedieval Basque village\nof Getaria as the 19th\ncentury came to a close.\nYet upon his death in\n1972, when headlines\nlamented the death\nof a \u2018king\u2019, there was\nno doubt about whom\nthey were referring to.\nHis childhood was\nspent far from the glamorous sartorial worlds of\nParis and Madrid, beneath\nthe red rooftop tiles of the\nstone houses that paved\nthe narrow alleys which\nlookedouttowardsthesea.\nHis father died in his\nearly childhood and it was\nhis mother\u2019s world that he\ninherited whilst growing\nup listening to the repetitive drill of her sewing\nmachine. Throughout\nhis early years they\nworked tirelessly and\nrigorously alongside to\nrepair, alter and transform the garments of\nhis mother\u2019s aristocratic\nclients, whose wardrobes\nwere in constant need\nof up-keep to reflect the\nlatest fashions. Amongst\nthem was the Marquesa\nde Casa Torres, a noblewoman renowned for\nher beauty and exquisite\ntaste who owned a villa\nin Getaria (now the\nBalenciaga Museum).\nShe allowed Balenciaga to visit her every day\nafter school to examine\nher extensive wardrobe\nstocked with elegant\ndresses brought back from\nher regular trips to Paris.\nFascinated by what he\nsaw, the precocious child\nboasted that he could\nmake her a dress as beautiful if the Marquesa would\nsupply him with the proper\ntools and materials: the\nresult did not disappoint\nand was worn to mass the\nfollowing week. When\nhe was barely 12 years\nold the wealthy patroness\nsent him to San Sebasti\u00e1n\nto obtain formal training\nfrom a reputed tailor,\nand thanks to her insight\nBalenciaga\u2019s vision was\nrealised in the world.\nFar removed from the\nreality of his everyday\nlife, the villa was more\nlike a palace; and it\nwas an opening into an\naristocratic world of an\nartistic refinement and sophistication which he otherwise could never have\naccessed. The Marquesa\nand the Marqu\u00e9s were\nart collectors, exposing\nthe young Crist\u00f3bal to\npaintings by Spanish\nmasters such as Goya,\nVel\u00e1zquez, and El Greco.\nThese became impressed\nonto his mind and later,\ninto his works, which not\nonly borrowed from the\nruched dresses and beaded\nboleros of flamenco\ndancers but directly inherited their grace and purity\nof line. The engravings,\ncatalogues, photographs\nand history books brought\nback from the Marquesa\u2019s\nEuropean travels formed\nmuch of his education.\nTen years later in 1917,\nhe established his own\ncouture house, capitalis-ing as did many fashion\ndesigners of the time on\nthe escapist and self-in-dulgent consumerist\nmood of the post-war era.\nYet Balenciaga disliked\nthe frivolous side of\nfashion and society life.\nThe atmosphere at his\nfashion shows was one of\nreligious reverence as aus-tere-faced models walked\nup and down in silence,\nindifferent to the whispering audience and its prolonged applause, whilst he\ndiscreetly observed from\na hole in the curtains.\nBy the 1950s, a veritable cult had amassed\naround the enigmatic\nBalenciaga, whose clients\nranged from Grace Kelly\nto Greta Garbo. Women\nwere addicted to his\ndesigns, curtseyed to\nhim as to royalty and\nwished to be buried in\nBalenciaga. The clothes\nthemselves were voluptuous and enabled ease\nof movement, flattered\nevery figure and were\nalways grand. Above all\nhis designs transfigured\nSpanish style whilst maintaining its essence. Traditional colour codes like\ncardinal red, saintly white,\nand the sober black of the\nSpanish court were turned\non their heads to produce\nfashionable gowns; from\nthe sequins and lace of\nthe matadors to the crin-olined and silk-layered\ngowns of society ladies,\nhis imagination freely\nadapted and merged\nhistorical elements with\nmore Western styles to\nproduce, in a way, a modernist sartorial re-imag-ining of Spanish identity.\nAlthough the Spanish\ncivil war forced him to establish his career in Paris,\nhe never forgot Geratia\nand his mother\u2019s sewing\nmachine, which he kept\nexhibited in his living\nroom in a spot overlooked\nbyanoutstretchedcrucifix.\nStyle - A personal narrative\nS\nu b c o n s c i o u s l y\nwhen I was\nyounger, and consciously now, the\nfirst thing I observe when\nI meet someone is their\noutfit. I remember telling\nmy mum when I\u2019d get\nback home from school\nwhich of my teachers in\nkindergarten were the best\ndressed, and that would be\nthe deciding factor of who\nmy favourite teacher was.\nIn the years that fol-lowed, I spent ages choosing my outfit before going out, regardless of the\nmagnitude of the occa-sion. Every summer before the start of term, it\nwas of utmost importance\nto me that my uniform\nwas well ironed, my clean\nwhite socks were of the\nright length and my black\nshoes were stylish and up\nto the latest trend. I went\nthrough black adidas running shoes, converse, converse high tops, and ballet\nflats. My outfit narrated\nmy story; the parts of my\nappearance I cared about\nand respecting myself\nenough to put effort into\nmaking myself presenta-ble. Having grown up in\nan international school\nwith people of all back-grounds, I\u2019d see brands\nfrom Balenciaga to Gucci.\nI almost felt obligated to\nstyle myself well enough\nsuch that I didn\u2019t need a\nbrand to speak for me.\nHowever, my appreciation for diverse style\nand everyone\u2019s representation of themselves\nthrough their outfits only\ncame after I saw a post\nInstagram about how\nwe shouldn\u2019t judge another person\u2019s outfit. We\nmight not know how the\nclothes someone choses\nto wear might represent\nparts of them that we do\nnot know about, therefore\nwe are in no position to\nmake a judgment about it.\nThis interested me because as a person who\ncares so much about how\nI present myself, it was\nhard to fathom the complexities behind every\nindividual\u2019s stylistic\nchoices, especially ones\nthat did not appeal to me.\nUpon further ponder-ing, it dawned on me\nthat style is more than\nthe trendy boots and the\ncrisp trench coats we\nsee all around London.\nIf an individual were to\nwear designer clothing,\nit shouldn\u2019t be interpreted that they come from a\nrich background with expensive style. Likewise, a\nparticularly jarring combination of colours does\nnot speak to their inability\nto match colour palettes\nand lack of stylishness.\nStyle lies in the jeans\nthat people have owned\nfor years or the worn out\nsneakers that have a charm\nof their own. Style isn\u2019t\nthe oversized tee one is\nwearing, simply because\nthat is the current fad, but\nthe old sweater that has\nbeen stretched out because\nit holds sentimental value\nand comes from a loved\none. Style isn\u2019t material-istic. Style is channeling\noutfits that represent one\u2019s\ncomfort, confidence, and\ncharisma. I believe that is\nwhat makes style eternal,\nas comfort, confidence,\nand charisma hold different value and meaning in everyone\u2019s lives.\nSo now as I continue to observe everyone\u2019s\noutfits, I do it to learn a\nlittle more about the hidden details in their story.\nFASHION\nPauline Ronnet\nFashion Writer\nFASHION\nSreenidhi Venkatesh\nFashion Writer\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020\n20\nFASHION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe hidden honesty in everyone\u2019s outfits\n\u201cHard to\nfathom the\ncomplexities\nbehind every\nindividuals\u2019s\nstylistic\nchoices\u201d\n\u201cOutfits that\nrepresent\none\u2019s comfort,\nconfidence and\ncharisma\u201d\n\n"

After a\nfirst listen, what stands out\nis the song\u2019s multiple contrasts throughout: Danny\nJeffries\u2019 synthy guitar\nspiraling behind drummer\nSilke Blansjaar\u2019s catchy\ncowbell riff (are cowbells\ncapable of riffing?) which\nclashes with the hard-hit-ting punk background\nof Sean Cousins\u2019 guitar.\nCousins\u2019 vocals harshly\ncontradict bassist Lizzie\nCouves\u2019 softly spoken\nvocals which leads to, at\nfirst glance, a slight mess\nof a song. Upon further\nlisten though it\u2019s possible\nto pick out the vocal\nhook and recognise that\n\u2018Milkshake\u2019 is Self Help\u2019s\ntake on current society,\nseen in lyrics like \u201cyou\nwant free speech, but you\ndon\u2019t move\u201d.

Sure, there isn\u2019t the\nglitz and glam of a bigger\ntheatre and you can count\nthe cast on one hand, but\nthese types of small shows\nare rewarding in their own\nway, presenting an intimate story in an intimate\nvenue.\nThe story is set in an\nunnamed, average British\ntown and sees young\nTommy (April Hughes)\ndevelop an unlikely\nfriendship with football\nlad Jordan (Helen Aluko).\nJordan is obsessed with\nrebellious drinking at\nchatting about girls,\nwhereas Tommy\u2019s mind\nseems occupied by other\nthings. Tommy is the\nantithesis of the laddish\nculture his new friend represents and spends lots of\ntime alone in his bedroom\napplying makeup. No, he\nis not a drag queen, trans\nor a \u201cfag\u201d as Jordan puts\nit. He uses the makeup as\na coping mechanism for\nthe anxiety he experiences\non a daily basis.\nPlaywright Lily\nShahmoon does a good job\nat crafting nippy dialogue\nwhich the audience fully\nbelieves that two teenage\nboys would be spouting.\nShahmoon accurately\nrepresents these menial\nconversations, she seems\nto have lots of relevant\nexperiences as a teenage\nboy! It has to be noted\nthat Hughes and Aluko\nare not teenage boys\neither, they are women.\nThe question which many\nin the audience must have\nbeen asking is: why cast\ntwo women to play two\nteenage boys? Is there\nreally such a drought\nof young male actors?\nApparently Shahmoon\nactually specified this in\nthe script that the casting\nbe done in this way. The\nwhole play is trying to\nchallenge our preconceived ideas of gender\nand this constant visual\nreminder does a good job\nat achieving that.\nHughes and Aluko\nare very convincing\nteenage boys and keep\nadding new dimensions\nto their characters with\nevery scene. The themes\nexplored in this coming\nof age piece aren\u2019t really\nabout sexuality but rather\nabout anxiety. The ending\nscenes seem to almost\ncompare the situation of\nthe two young boys, this\ndid not seem absolutely\nnecessary as in some\nways it belittled Jordan\u2019s\nstruggles. However the\nplay must be applauded in\nthe way it visually depicts\nanxiety. The scenes in\nthe nightclub - not sure\nhow two 16 year olds got\nin - shows Tommy experiencing panic/anxiety\nattacks. Using a combination of lighting, sound\nand of course acting,\nthe audience can really\nunderstand what anxiety\nreally feels like.\nImperial College Symphony Orchestra: Spring Term\nConcert\nI\nt is always a great\npleasure to attend\nan Imperial College\nOrchestra concert.\nHow these musicians\nmanage to maintain their\nremarkable standard and\nattend courses at Imperial\nis quite beyond me.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why I gave\nup music when I got here.\nHowever, although very\ngood and certainly mem-orable, there are always\nareas of a performance\nthat one can iron out.\nThe concert was launched\nby Portsmouth Point, a\npiece inspired by a print of\nthe British fleet departing\nfrom port. The print features\nmany scenes of merrymaking and intoxication, and the\npiece mirrored this, bustling\nwith energy, as the original\nprint bustled with activity,\nwith the theme being enthusiastically passed between\ndifferent sections of the or-chestra. Occasionally, it felt\nas though the orchestra emphasised the theme of intox-ication, scrambling to keep\nup with the hectic score.\nEnjoyable and rapid, it certainly primed my ears for the\nrest of the concert.\nThe next piece was Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, by Stuart Hancock,\nfeaturing violin soloist Jack\nLiebeck. Here, the orchestra\nproved their mettle as an ensemble that understands the\nsubtleties of playing \u201csecond\nfiddle.\u201d A soaring performance by Liebeck was ably\nsupported by the orchestra. I\nparticularly enjoyed the vul-must be honest and confess\nthat I preferred the gentle\nbeginning of the piece compared to the more rambunctious conclusion.\nThe orchestra finally\ncame into their own in the\nsecond half with Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition. Mussorgsky\u2019s composition features many different\nvignettes, as a tribute to his\ndeceased artist friend named\nVictor Hartmann. The orchestra surged into this\nrendition, featuring many\nexcellent solos from across\nthe group. The trumpets, of\ncourse, performed an excellent job, but the true moment\nof the piece was the saxophonist\u2019s solo. Wonderfully\nexecuted and performed with\npanache this piece made for\na fitting end to a concert\nfrom one of the UK\u2019s most\nexcellent university symphony orchestras.

London\nBridal Fashion Week is\njust around the corner and\nit\u2019s only fair we dedicate\nan article to the glorious\ncreations that were once\nfeatured in almost every\ngirl\u2019s dream. While the\nfemale to male ratio at\nImperial is unfortunate,\ninternational women\u2019s\nday was just a week ago\nand this article is for the\nladies that have yet to say\nyes to the dress.\nLet\u2019s delve into a\nlittle history of wedding\ndresses. Today we see\nwedding dresses as a\nsymbol of love and\ncommitment and to all\nthe to-be brides out there,\nthe most beautiful piece\nof overpriced garment\nfor the supposedly most\nspecial day of your life.\nFASHION\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nMARCH, 2020 FELIX\n18\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nLet\u2019s take a walk down the memory lane of bridal fashion.\nPrincess Diana in one of the most iconic wedding dresses of all time, 1981 // Flickr Grace Kelly\u2019s wedding 1956 // Flickr\nAudrey Hepburn in Pierre Balmain, Sept 1954 // Flickr\nWith the increasing\nvariety in materials,\ncolours and silhouettes,\nbrides worldwide gather\nan entourage of bridesmaids and spends weeks\nif not months searching\nfor the one perfect dress.\nBut in early bridal\nhistory, wedding dresses\nwere merely a symbol of\na business transaction,\nsignifying the wealth and\nstatus of two newly allied\nfamilies. In fact, wedding\ndresses were rarely the\nextravagant bouquet of\npersonalised white fabric\nwe know today, but\nrather the finest existing\ndress in the closet. While\ncontemporary non-white\ndresses are likely worn\nto make a statement,\ndark-coloured wedding\ndresses were the norm in\nthe earliest ceremonies.\nIt was not until 1849\nthat Godey\u2019s Lady Book,\na women\u2019s magazine at\nthe time, declared white\nas \u201cthe most fitting hue\u201d\nfor all things bridal. In\naddition to signifying\ninnocence and purity,\nwhite fabric was the most\ndifficult to procure and\npreserve. A bride dressed\nin an intricate white gown\nwas the perfect declaration\nof social status and wealth.\nFashion and history\ngo hand in hand. Just\nlike the how changing\nsocial dynamics underlie\nthe evolution from conservative hemlines to\naudacious flapper fashion,\nbridal fashion evolved\nalong with historical circumstances that affected\nthe economy and availability of precious fabrics.\nWhen the great depression hit, decreasing disposable income meant any\nremaining pennies would\nnot be spent on dresses\nthat are only to be worn\nonce and ordinary dresses\nsufficed once more. Soon,\nthe beginning of World\nWar II compelled young\nloved ones and newly\nenlisted men to rush to\nthe alter. Along with the\neffects of rationing and\nscare resources, wartime\nbridal fashion was not\nonly non-traditional but\ninvolved a decent amount\nof creativity. While most\nmade do with available\nfabrics and modest\ndesigns, women with\ntheir minds set on a white\ndress engaged in creative\nefforts to repurpose\nremnants of silk parachutes that safely returned\nwith their grooms-to-be.\nAs the economy\nrecovered, luxurious\nwhite dressed resurfaced\nonce more. We owe it\nto designers of the time\nthat fairy-tale-worthy\ngowns of Grace Kelly,\nAudrey Hepburn and\nPrincess Diana graced\nthis earth. These iconic\ndresses remain as some\nof the most remembered\ndesigns of all time.\nBack to modern day, celebrity and royal wedding\ndresses still make the\nheadlines without fail\nevery year. Whether\nmarriage is your \u2018thing\u2019 or\nnot, bridal fashion is here\nto stay and flourish. We\nare very much blessed to\nbe born in an age of peace\nwhen bridal designers can\nplay fairy god mother and\nlittle girls can dream of\nbeing married in \u201cnothing\nbut custom Vera Wang\u201d.\nFinally, as a public\nservice announcement\nto the few bridal fashion\nenthusiasts out there.\nLondon bridal fashion\nweek is happening from\nMarch 22nd to 24th just\nas Easter break begins.\nWords cannot capture the\nelegance and intricacy\nof wedding dresses, so\nI will leave it to you to\nadmire them yourself.\n\n"

The interspersed\nnarratives converge in\nthe middle, giving the\nshow it\u2019s only duet in the\nprocess.\nIn the beginning of\ntheir relationship, Cathy\nis a struggling actress\nwhile Jamie is a hopeful\nwriter. By the end, Jamie\nhas found success with his\nwriting, whereas Cathy is\nstill struggling. Although\nthis contributes to the\nstrain in their relationship,\nthe problems are far\ndeeper. The 90 minute run\nis well utilized to explore\nthe nuances of this\nfragmented relationship\nwithout assigning blame,\nresulting in a well-bal-anced exploration into\nhow things can change\nslowly yet irreparably in\nlife.\nBoth Higginson\nand Lynch are brilliant\nvocalists who carry the\nsongs that are the living\n\u201cIn some ways,\nit is incredibly\nSondheimesque, with\nsmartly placed\ncall-backs and\nreferences\nto earlier\nmoments\nwithin the\nshow...\u201d\n\u201cThe limited\nstage size\nmakes the\nshow feel\na little too\nkaraoke at\ntimes\u201d\nproof of Brown\u2019s musical\ngenius. In fact, this production does wonders to\nremind musical theatre\nenthusiasts that The Last\nFive Years, despite its\nsimple premise and a\nmere cast size of two, is\nprobably one of the most\nexceptionally written,\nmost cohesive musicals in\nrecent times. Brown\u2019s way\nof using the same lyrics\nand melodies in different\nsongs in a way that has the\nexact opposite meaning is\ntruly astonishing and his\nuse of chords and patterns\nin the accompaniment is\nsuperb. In some ways, it is\nincredibly Sondheim-esque, with smartly placed\ncall-backs and references\nto earlier moments within\nthe show, with just enough\nvariation to demonstrate\nthe changing stakes and\nthe strain on the relation-ship.\nEven within a single\nsong, for example, \u2018See\nI\u2019m Smiling\u2019, Brown\u2019s\nwriting was able to tactfully capture the characters\u2019\nwide range of emotions.\nOther highlights include\nthe songs \u2018If I Didn\u2019t\nBelieve in You\u2019 and \u2018Still\nHurting\u2019, perhaps the\ntwo most widely known\nsongs from the musical.\nThe lyrics in these songs\nwere hard hitting, delving\ndeep into the characters\u2019\npsyche, allowing for a\ncomplex analyses of who\nthese people are in their\ncore. The show is not all\ntoo serious though, and\nhas its fair share of hilarious moments. Thanks to\nthe smart use of everyday\nobjects as props, and songs\nsuch as \u2018The Schmuel\nSong\u2019 which cut through\nserious moments, the\nshow manages to capture\nthe comedic element of\nmusicals while addressing\nintense themes, without\ngoing overboard with\neither.\nDirected by Jonathan\nO\u2019Boyle, the staging is\nsimple, with a grand piano\non the small Southwark\nPlayhouse stage. As one\nof the characters sings,\nthe other plays along at\nthe piano. In an interview,\nLynch describes the piano\nas almost having a character of its own. This comes\nacross quite vividly in\nthis production thanks to\nBrown\u2019s gorgeous score.\nUnfortunately, having one\nof the two actors play the\npiano through the production limits the amount\nof interaction the two\ncharacters could possibly\nhave.\nThe limited stage size\nmakes the show feel a\nlittle too karaoke at times.\nHowever, this works at\ntimes in the show\u2019s favour,\nas it allows the actors to\ndirectly tell their story to\nthe audience while also\nsinging to each other..\nHowever, the presence of\na grand piano on the tiny\nstage definitely restricts\nthe performers\u2019 range of\nmovement, perhaps exacerbating the lack of chemistry between Higginson\nand Lynch, which made\nit all the more difficult to\nsell to the audience why\nthey\u2019d be in love enough\nto get married in the first\nplace. However, this\nmild lack of chemistry\nworks excellently in\nthe moments where the\ncouple are going through\na rough patch or are on\nthe verge of breaking\nup. Additionally, despite\nthe revolving stage and\nthe in-the-round set up,\nHigginson and Lynch\nspend a tad too long with\ntheir backs turned to the\nentire audience, a feat\nhard to achieve given the\nstage set up. However, the\none aspect of the staging\nwhich works marvellously well is the lighting,\nwhich shifts from warm\npinks and yellows to cold\nwhites and blues as the relationship turns sour. This\nnot only helps explore the\nemotional turbulence that\nthe characters are experi-encing, but also makes it\neasier for the audience to\nkeep track of the changing\ntimelines.\nThis new production of\nTheLastFiveYearsproves\nonce again why Brown is\none of the most esteemed\nmusical theatre writers of\nthis century. Higginson\nand Lynch more than\nhold their own against\nthe music, ensuring that\nthe production is fun and\ngut-wrenching all at once.\nAt the piano is where it all plays out // Pamela Raith Photography\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "Tycho Takes Us Back a Decade\nTycho\u2019s latest effort is a return to an earlier style; but one that lacks the originality and impetus of prior work\nC\nreating a sense\nof space in\nmusic is hard.\nMusic itself\ndoesn\u2019t really correlate\nto any physical space as\nsuch. Mozart might make\nyou dream of Salzburg or\nsome Viennese ballroom;\nPink Floyd might be able\nto make you feel like\nyou\u2019re sitting behind a\nspartan bench of an old\nEnglish school. Many\nof these notions come\nfrom powerful cultural\ncrosslinks, a mesh of\nreferences to which there\nis no end. But what if\nyou are presented with a\npiece of music only \u2013 no\ncultural lexicon, no lyrics,\nno image to guide you?\nCreating a beautiful\nsoundscape \u2013 one which\nyou can fully immerse\nyourself in \u2013 is what\nambient electronic music\naims to do. It goes beyond\nthe total recall of referential work and aims to\ncreate something new.\nIt is sound design at its\npurest. The sonic building\nblocks must be perfect.\nThe totality of the whole\nmust be convincing, else\nthe aim of the exercise has\nbeen defeated. With his\nnewest effort, Simulcast,\nforty-three-year-old Californian producer Tycho\nhas gone back to ambient\nbasics, letting go of the\nvocals he unprecedentedly\nintroduced on his previous\nalbum. The question on\neveryone\u2019s lips is whether\nthis represents a return\nto form or whether this\nshort, thirty-five-minute\nalbum is a somewhat lazy,\nuber-chill version of its\npredecessor. Is there more\nto explore in the universe\nof his music?\nThe American\u2019s work\nis difficult to pin down\nto a genre. It is quintes-sentially electronic, using\nboth digital and analogue\nsynthesisers heavily.\nOn the other hand, his\nno-nonsense percussion\nborrows heavily from\nrock, as do the variedly\ndistorted guitars which\ncarry a hefty portion of\nthe melodic load. Overall,\nthe influence of the early\nwork of Scottish ambient\nmaestros Boards of\nCanada cannot be over-looked. With a sprightlier\nsound than the brothers\nfrom north Britannia,\nTycho sounds as though\ntheir music travelled to\nSan Francisco and got a\n\u201cMany\naccuse Tycho\nof making\nspruced up\nbackground\nmusic for\nthe YouTube\ngeneration\u201d\ntan. This might make his\nsound more appealing, but\nit also makes it blander.\nMany accuse Tycho\nof making spruced up\nbackground music for the\nYouTube generation.\nThe compositional\naspects of great ambient\nare all there \u2013 the elements\nwhooshing from ear to ear,\nthe strange, and at points\nalmost inaudible, samples\nfrom obscure VHS tapes,\nand the ephemeral synths\nwhich sound like they\u2019re\ncoming from millions of\nmiles away, inviting you\nto step into his world.\nThe entry point of\nSimulcast is the closing\nsong from the old album,\nWeather. Like many of\nthe songs on the new\nalbum, it is a reworked,\ninstrumental version of\nits counterpart from the\nprevious. Despite the\nGrammy nomination for\nWeather, many fans felt\nthat the album was a departure from the original\nTycho sound. Simulcast\nis supposed to reverse\nthat trend and offer up\nsomething closer to his\nDive trilogy.\nThat is certainly something he\u2019s been able to\ndo. The production is unmistakably Tycho: cool,\ncomforting and clean.\nIt is exactly the kind of\nrecord you would want to\nlisten to on a sunlit walk\nthrough the park, early on\na Sunday morning when\nno one is there. It offers\nserenity, can serve as a\nbackdrop to introspection,\nand can be mindfully\nshooed away by more\nimportant thoughts. It is\nwhat you want it to be. It\ndoes not impose.\nTo say that Simulcast\nis soulless would be diffi-cult. That would mean all\nof his music is soulless. It\nis also not possible to say\nthat it is not technically\ngood. The arrangement\nis impeccable, the\nmelodies are thoroughly\nthought-out, and the mix\nis perfect. What must be\nsaid, though, is that it\nseems drained. Drained of\ncolour, drained of original\nelements, and lacking an\nelement of surprise.\nTycho\u2019s sonic universe\nis like a memory palace\nfull of wonder. Every\nobject is placed with preci-sion, shade and light play\ntogether to make you feel\nat ease. It is like a home\nbeach on the moon: alien\nbut comfortable. There are\nhighlights on the album\nwhich almost go so far as\nto add a new dimension to\nthe place. Outer Sunset,\nInto the Woods and Easy\nform the core of the album\nand make for an excellent\nlistening experience. So\nmuch of the rest of the\nsongs can\u2019t help but bleed\ninto the background.\nAccording to the\nlitmus test of ambient\nmusic outlined at the\nstart, I would have to\nreject Simulcast as a great\nambient album. If the\ncover art of the album,\nthe California cliffs,\nepitomise the scenes he is\ntrying to conjure up, then\nthe act of listening to him\nrepeatedly is like driving\na red cabrio on the roads\natop them every day. With\neach passing drive, the\nbeautiful scenery imprints\nitself ever more on your\nmemory. Even after a\ndecade of driving down it\nevery day, when prompted\nyou can convince\nsomeone of its beauty.\nNevertheless, it becomes\nsomething too familiar. It\nbegins to fade away. Into\nthe background.\nCalifornian cliffs: like the album, once-wondrous, they will fade into daily routine if visited too often // Ninja Tune\nISSUE 1747\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Tycho.

The original game\nwas so good, exploring\ndungeons from floor to\nfloor, recruiting Pok\u00e9mon\non your way and delving\ndeep into the surprisingly\nrich story. The remake\nonly elevates the original\ngame with a hand-drawn\nartstyle and the choice\nbetween a handheld or big\nscreen experience.\nOri and the Will of the\nWisps\nMarch 11th\nXbox One, PC\nThe sequel to one of the\nmost creative Xbox games\nin a while, Will of the\nWisps looks to be as beautiful and full of wonder as\nthe original. There looks\nto be an equally engrossing plot this time around,\nwith amazing platforming\ngameplay. The objective\nis the same as last time\naround, find the key and\nopen the doors, but with\nthe addition of boss fights\nthis time around, it looks\nas though a breath of fresh\nair has been blown over\nOri\u2026 not like it needed it\nthough!\nNioh 2\nMarch 13th\nPS4\nSequel to the surprise\nhit Nioh in early 2017,\nNioh 2 looks to be just\nas challenging and just\nas rewarding as the first.\nWith new powerful Yo-kai\nabilities and the ability to\nsummon NPCs to help you\nin a fight. From previews\navailable, it looks like the\nbosses this time round are\nmonstrous. Nioh 2 adds\nnew abilities and options\nto the player, but with a\ncorresponding difficulty\nspike, any player that\nbeats the game should\nfeel an amazing sense of\naccomplishment.\nMLB the Show 20\nMarch 17th\nPS4\nBaseball! While not the\nmost popular sport in the\nU.K., MLB the Show is\na long running franchise\n(soontoloseitsPlaystation\nexclusivity) that makes\nthe game of baseball\ninteresting to both play\nand watch. If you ever\nplayer Wii Sports baseball\nand thought \u2018Damn I wish\nthis was more realistic\u2019,\nthen here is the game for\nyou! With new gameplay\nmechanics increasing the\nbalance between different\nplayable sportsmen, the\ngame has become much\nmore dynamic than in\nprevious years. Also, for\nthe first time, there is the\nability to play both Major\nleague and Minor league\nsportsmen, meaning the\npool of players you can\nchoose from is bigger than\never!\nAnimal Crossing: New\nHorizons\nMarch 20th\nSwitch\nFinally, the wait is\nalmost over. Animal\nCrossing is a beloved\nfranchise by many. You\nplay a little bit every day,\nslowly building up your\ntown and increasing your\ncollections of bugs, fish\nand fossils. It is simple yet\ncharming and addictive,\nand the Switch addition\nof the franchise looks to\nreally bring things up a\nnotch. In New Horizons,\nyou play as a character\non the Tom Nook Island\nGetaway Package. With\nfree roam around a\ndessert island that you\ncan customise at your will\n(seriously you can literally terraform the entire\nisland) there is more room\nto show your creativity\nthan ever. Nintendo has\nsaid that they are planning\nevents all year round,\nmeaning this is going to\nbe a game that you will\nfind yourself coming\nback to time and time\nagain. Definitely worth\nthe full price to me, I will\nbe picking it up and for\nanyone who has a Switch\nbut never has enough time\nto dedicate hours a day to\nit, I recommend that you\ndo the same!\nDOOM Eternal\nMarch 20th\nEverything (Switch date\nTBC)\nComing out on the\nsame day as Animal\nCrossing, the absolute antithesis of the furry friend\nsurrounded life simulator\nis DOOM eternal, a\ngame where you blow up\ndemons. If DOOM 2016\nwas anyone to go off,\nDOOM eternal should\nabsolutely knock it out\nof the part. High octane\ngameplay, with dynamic\ncombat implementing a\nwide array of weapons\nagainst an equally diverse\ngroup of enemies, DOOM\nconstantly keeps the heart\nrate up whilst at the same\ntime making you feel\nlike a complete badass.\nWith double the amount\nof gameplay as the first,\nand hopefully double\nthe amount of gore, let\u2019s\nhope Bethesda doesn\u2019t\npull a Fallout 76, and\nreally gives us something\ngood here. A nice relaxing\nbreak from the stress of\npaying back a loan in\nAnimal Crossing later this\nmonth.\nHalf-Life Alyx\nMarch 23rd\nPC\nWHAT??? HALFLIFE 3 CONFIRMED???\nUnfortunately, no. But\nhere is the next best thing,\na completely new half-life game in VR made by\nvalve! This is looking to\ntruly evolve the state of\nVR games in the modern\nday, being a complete\nfirst-person shooter\ngame that both looks and\nsounds just like half-life.\nInstead of a gravity gun,\nyou instead have a gravity\nglove that allows for\nmanipulation of various\nobjects throughout the\nworld. One way in which\nvalve has looked to deal\nwith movement in a VR\nworld to prevent motion\nsickness is to give the\noption to active teleport\nto points in front of you\nrather than having to walk\nthere. This is a nice choice\nfor anyone that may get\nsick after playing VR for\ntoo long. It does seem to\nbe a slower paced half-life\ngame than fans are used\nto, but every location\nlooks so full to the brim\nof reasons to explore that\nit is absolutely worth the\nsacrifice of pace.\nPersona 5 Royal\nMarch 31st\nPS4\nEffectively a re-release\nof Persona 5, but with\nmuch, much more content\nadded, Persona 5 Royal is\na must buy for anyone that\nis interested in the game\nbut has yet to take the\nleap of faith and buy it. In\none of the quintessential\nRPG experiences of last\ndecade, you take control\nof a high-school student,\ncodenamed Joker who\n(among others) forms the\nPhantom Theives, a group\nwith the aim of stealing\ncorruption from adults\nto help reform a broken\ncity. Royal looks to add\nsignificantly to the story,\nsuch that it acts almost as\na sequel. I don\u2019t want to\nspoil too much so all I will\nsay is if you have been\nlooking for a good RPG to\nplay, get this, please.\nResident Evil 3\nApril 3rd\nPS4, PC, Xbox One\nA remake of Resident\nEvil 3 from 1999, this third\nOri and the Will of the Wisps looks as breathtakingly gorgeous as its predecessor // Moon Studios\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\n\u201cMarch and\nApril are\npacked with\na hot pot\nof amazing\ngames to dive\ninto!\u201d\n\n"

Both of\nthese are made together\nfor convenience\u2019s sake -one uses egg yolks, and\nthe other takes care of the\negg whites.\nAll you need for cr\u00e8me\nbr\u00fbl\u00e9e is double cream,\negg yolks, sugar, vanilla\nessence, and salt.\nIn a saucepan that you\ncan stir your cream with\na spoon and not be burnt,\npour in the double cream,\n2 tablespoons of sugar, an\neighth of a teaspoon of\nsalt, and half a teaspoon\nof the vanilla, and keep it\non low heat. Stir that mix\nand put on some music\n(I recommend a musical,\nperhaps the soundtrack to\nHamilton). If your double\ncream refuses to vacate\nits pot, leave it near the\nflame and scoop out with\na spoon. From my experience with baking, don\u2019t\nbother with the exact\nproportions of differences\nbetween American and\nBritish tablespoons. Use\nwhatever you think is an\neating spoon as a table-spoon, and a teaspoon is\nroughly a third of that.\nFractions are running\nrampant today! (Not like\non the 14th, because pi\nis irrational) While your\ncream and sugar mixture\nis reaching a bare simmer,\npreheat your oven to about\n150 degrees Celcius, and\nseparate your eggs.\nBy separating your\neggs, I don\u2019t mean from\neach other. I mean separating the egg yolks from\nthe egg whites, with the\nyolks in a bowl, and the\nwhites in a big metal\nmixing bowl. Leave the\negg whites for now - we\u2019ll\ncome to them when\nmaking the meringues.\nBeat the eggs together,\nand turn off the heat\nwhen your cream reaches\nthat bare simmer. Now,\nmix in the remaining 3\ntablespoons of sugar into\nthe yolks, one spoon at a\ntime. Mix in the sugar just\nbefore you start adding\nin the cream - you might\nend up with eggy lumps\notherwise! Slowly, spoon\nin the warm cream mix,\nmaking sure to mix the\negg yolks while doing\nso. This process, known\nas tempering, prevents\nthe yolks from curdling,\nwhere heat from the\nmixture cooks the yolk.\nI don\u2019t know about you,\nbut I prefer my sweet\ndishes to not taste like\nan omelet. Once you\u2019ve\nmixed about an equal\nvolume of cream and\nyolks without curdling,\npour the entire thing back\ninto the saucepan and\nmix. If some curdling\ndoes occur, keep in mind\nthat the only people eating\nthis experiment are broke\nuniversity students - they\nare probably the kind of\nplebs who can\u2019t taste the\ndifference between caster\nsugar and regular white\nsugar. By this point, the\nmix may have stuck to\nthe edges of the pan and\nbecome denser. Just mix it\ntogether.\nPour into the ramekins\nof your choice - I reused\nsome oven-proof glass\npots that used to contain\nsome sort of cheesecake\nfrom Tesco, make do with\nwhat you have. Keep in\nmind that ramekins are\nnot the only things ov-en-proof, and spring-form\nStiff peaks.

    "content": "The Time Machine: A Prescient Journey through the\nFourth Dimension\nBe transported through time as you lose yourself in this production at the iconic London Library.\nW\ne met our\ntime traveller soon\nafter walking through a glitzy door,\nstanding at the bottom of\none of the plush staircases\nof the London Library.\nThe location is exquisite\nand could have leaked\nout of the inky pages of a\nhistorical novel - perhaps\nthat is why it was chosen\nto be the setting for this\nstrange, yet unique, tour\nthrough time.\nOur Time Traveller\n(Paul Taylor) looks very\nsteampunk, wearing\nmedieval looking clothes\nwith a strangely modern\nfeel to them. He looks at\nus in shock, examining us,\nsometimes uncomfortably\nclosely, scrutinising our\nfaces with the expression\nof a man who has chanced\nupon his unexpected\nsaviours. We are truly\nimmersed, as we follow\nhim on a journey into\nthe heart of this historic\nbuilding, through the\nvarious hidden gems\nof rooms, where socks\n(or the Time Traveller\u2019s\niconic round glasses)\nchange colour when\nyou\u2019re not looking, and\nthe ever-present threat of\nbeings known as morlocks\ndrives us forward.\nThe Time Machine\nis an adaptation of H.G\nWells\u2019 full length work of\nfiction by the same name,\nthat describes the journey\nof a man 800,000 years\ninto the future, where he\nwitnesses an unrecog-nisably weird post-apoc-alyptic society. Wells\nwho was an alumnus of\nImperial (well, actually,\ntechnically of a College\nthat eventually became\npart of it), is perceived by\nmany to be the father of\nscience fiction, and introduced the concept of the\ntime machine to the world\nthrough this novella.\nThis production,\nwritten by Jonathan\nHolloway and directed\nby Natasha Rickman,\ntakes the story and makes\nit relevant to today.\nInterestingly, Holloway\ninterviewed experts from\nthe renowned Wellcome\nCentre for Ethics and Humanities in order to learn\nabout possible problems\nwith future societies.\nThey predicted, among\nother phenomena including human augmentation,\nthat another SARS-like\npandemic would spread\naround the world. The\ncatch is that this was in\nthe late months of 2019,\nwell before the C word\nreplaced the B word as\na permanent fixture on\nthe bottom bars of news\nchannels worldwide. It\nseems that the material\nthat has fleshed out the\noriginal story for this production is indeed relevant\nand prescient, having\nstood the test of\u2026 time\nuntil now.\nOur Time Traveller\ndynamism guides us\nsmoothly through the\nvarious stages of our\njourney, keeping us entertained while managing\nto instil a genuine fear for\nthe morlocks. Throughout the production, we\nwitness his interactions\nwith various figures\nin time. Notably, The\nComputer (Graeme Rose)\n- an embodied machine\nwith a dry wit, who puts\non an acutely mechanical\ndisplay: he must have\nvery dry eyes given I\ndidn\u2019t see him blink once,\nbut maybe machines don\u2019t\nrequire eyelids to refresh\ntheir visual sensors.

Indeed, the place\nseems to be a part of time\nitself, with various cast\nmembers appearing and\nsuddenly disappearing\ninto the maze once again,\nas if they had jumped a\nfew years backwards or\nforwards suddenly. Very\nfew props are employed\nand the flow of the story is\nmoulded to the geography\nof the library, with little in\nthe way of scenery.

I still remember\nplaying RE 3 when I\nwas younger, albeit a\nfew years later than its\nrelease\u2026 and this game is\nexactly how I remember\nit. The developers over at\nCapcom have done a great\njob of making a game that\nis in pretty much all way\nsuperior to the original,\nwhilst still feeling exactly\nlike you remember. Where\nResident Evil 7\u2019s Mr X\noccasionally popped up\nand was easily dealt with,\nNemesis looks to be a\nwhole different beast.

I am currently\ntrying to play through\nFallout 76 with a friend.\nWhile it is nice to play\nwith him\u2026 that\u2019s about it.\nThe game honestly still is\nas buggy and frustrating as\neveryone says. Hopefully,\nwith the Wastelanders expansion (which is free by\nthe way) coming out next\nmonth, we should start\nto see an improvement\nto the game. Bethesda\nare adding NPCs finally,\nwith dialogue options that\nare \u2018More like Fallout 3\nthan Fallout 4\u2019.

This month is a\nmonster for remakes with\nboth RE 3 and FFVII.\nGiven the immense love\nfor this game back when\nit released on the PS1, a\nremake was all but needed\nin with today\u2019s graphical\nand technical capabilities.\nWhile this game will only\ninclude the first section of\nthe original (taking place\nentirely in Midgar), it\nwill still be a full-length\ngame (meaning at least 30\nhours long). I am insanely\nexcited for what they will\nadd to the story, as well as\nrevisioning the world that\nI loved when I first played\nit. I could not recommend\nthis game more highly. If\nthere is anything that you\npick up in April, It should\nbe Final Fantasy VII\nremake.\nTrials of Mana\nApril 24th\nSwitch, PC, PS4\nAnother remake! Trials\nof Mana, known previously as Seiken Densetsu\n3, is a game that was originally released in 1995\nas a sequel to the much\nbeloved Secret of Mana.\nFor the 25th anniversary,\nSquare Enix are completely remaking the game in\nfull HD with voice acting.\nNever before released in\nthe West, finally fans of\nthe series will have the\nopportunity to experience\nthis part of the story of\nMana.

So sadly, I\nhad to miss out Gears\nTactics and Predator:\nHunting grounds, 2\ngames I would highly\nrecommend checking\nout also. The last game\nI wanted to highlight is\nMinecraft Dungeons.

Global Central\nBanks have been quick to\nreact to the increasing risk\nto the major economic\npowers. On the 3rd of\nMarch, the US Federal\nReserve shocked the\nmarkets by cutting its\nmain policy rates by 50\nbasis points. This was the\nfirst emergency rate cut\nafter the financial crisis\nin 2008. Other banks\nfollowed suit with the\nBank of Canada reducing\nthe rate from 1.75% to\n1.25%. Both the Reserve\nBank of Australia and the\nBank Negara Malaysia\nreduced their benchmark\nrates by 25 basis points\nto 0.5% and 2.5% re-spectively. The Bank of\nEngland (BoE) has just\nannounced a 0.5% rate cut\non the Wednesday (11th\nof March). It is important\nto note that for some\ncentral banks interest rate\ncuts are not feasible \u2013 the\nEurozone and Japan\nalready have negative\nrates. Further reductions\ncould be destructive to\nbanks \u2013 in a negative\ninterest rates environ-ment, banks have to pay\nout of their pocket for the\nloans they hold. In other\nwords, this gives banks\nan incentive to not give\ncredit. Negative rate cuts\nalso discourage savers\nfrom keeping money in\nbanks, which again is bad\nfor the banking system.\nProvided that interest\nrate remains positive,\ninterest rate cuts normally\nstimulate the economy\n\u2013 people are more likely\nto borrow at lower rates\nand invest the money.\nHowever, the recent\ninterest rate cuts failed\nto combat the economic\nimpact of COVID-19.\n\u201cthe Bank\nof England\n(BoE) has just\nannounced\na 0.5% rate\ncut on the\nWednesday\n(11th of\nMarch)\u201d\nFELIX\nThe key here is the fact\nthat the root of economic\nproblems from the\noutbreak is not inherently\nfinancial, but rather psy-chological. An increasing\nnumber of people worldwide are getting anxious\nabout travelling or visiting\nshops and restaurants in\nfear of contracting the\nvirus. Interest rate cuts are\nhighly unlikely to solve\nthe problem of plummeting global consumer\nconfidence and demand\ndeficit.\nIt cannot be a solution\nto the supply problem\neither \u2013 the supply chains\nall over the world have\nbeen disrupted as a result\nof travel bans, restrictions\nand quarantines. Many\neconomists argue that\nthe decision to cut the\nrate in fear of recession\nwas rushed and could\npotentially harm the US\neconomy.\nAccording to key\nmetrics, the US economy\nwas not in a vulnerable\nposition before the\noutbreak and even the\neconomic shock following the outbreak was\nunlikely to trigger reces-sion. Interestingly, the US\n- China trade war could\nhave buffered the global\nsupply disruption \u2013 the\ntariffs on China-produced\ngoods caused several\nmanufacturers to move\nproduction out of China.\nWhile in theory interest\nrate cuts are good for\nmarkets, on this occasion,\ninvestor reaction was the\nopposite. Following the\nFed cut, yields on long-term 10-year US Treasury\nbonds have plummeted to\nthe record low of under\n1%. This in turn led to\nnarrowing of the gap\nbetween the 10-year and\n2-year bonds, which is\nconsidered to be a sign\nof an upcoming recession.\nAs experts argue, the US\neconomy was not particularly susceptible to recession before, but the recent\nrate cut could have pushed\nthe economy to \u2018Japanification\u2019 \u2013 a concept used\nto describe stagnated\neconomic growth and\nrepeating cycles of recession in Japan even with\nnegative interest rates.\nAll of this begs the\nquestion \u2013 could rate\ncuts be the solution to\nthe economic shock?\nSouth Korea, one of the\nmost seriously affected\nby COVID-19 countries,\nseems to have taken\nanother route. Instead of\nstimulating the markets\nby rate cuts, they decided\nto provide administrative\nand fiscal support to\nsmaller business to keep\nthem going, as well as\nto provide childcare\nsubsidies. Experts world-C\noronavirus has\nbeen the top\nnews headline\nfor the past few\nweeks. As BBC reports,\nthe total death toll worldwide has passed 3,500\nas of the 7th of March.\nThe spread of the virus\nhas put enormous strain\non healthcare resources\nin the affected countries\nAnara Kukenova\nICIS\nInvestment Member\nwide are anticipating\nfurther global easing as\nthe outbreak progresses.\nAndrew Bailey, who is due\nto become BoE governor\non the 16th of March said\nthat the central bank will\nswiftly respond to prevent\neconomic shock from the\nvirus. Therefore, the 0.5%\ncut to British interest rates\ndid not catch the investors\nby surprise. The central\nbank also highlighted\nthat further actions might\nbe taken if required. As\nthe situation with the\nCOVID-19 outbreak\ndevelops rapidly, experts\nargue that BoE will\nhave to take additional\nmeasures sooner than later\nto combat the economic\nfallout as UK economic\ngrowth in January failed\nto meet predictions.\nand led to major travel\ndisruption all over the\nglobe. Unsurprisingly, the\nfinancial markets have\nbeen quick to reflect the\ngrowing concerns of investors worldwide of this\nvolatile situation.\nThe rapid spread of\nthe epidemic around\nthe globe has severely\naffected the global\neconomic powers such\nas China, South Korea,\nItaly and Iran. As the\ntrajectory of the outbreak\nis highly unpredictable,\nthe worldwide damage\ncan only be estimated.\nIn the most pessimistic\nscenario proposed by\nBloomberg Economics,\nthe COVID-19 epidemic\ncould lead to recessions\nof US, the Eurozone and\n\u201cin the most\npessimistic\nscenario\nproposed [...]\nrecessions\nof US, the\nEurozone and\nJapan and cost\na total of $2.7\ntrillion [...]\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n29\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nISSUE 1747\nA closer look: Inflation and the money machine.\nINVESTMENT\nPavan Singh Gill\nICIS\nInvestment Co-Editor\nT\nhe layman\ndefinition of\ninflation refers\nto the increase in\nthe cost of goods and ser-vices. Another definition\nwould be the reduction\nof purchasing power due\nto the loss of the intrinsic\nvalue of money relative\nto the cost of goods and\nservices. This provides\ntwo perspectives, the\nfirst being the goods and\nservices have a greater\nperceived value and the\nsecond that money has\nlost its intrinsic value.\nBoth are somewhat\nlogical and relevant.\nWhy do I say that?\nLet us begin by stating\nthat money has lost its\nvalue. And we shall first\nestablish that money is a\nrepresentation of work.\nThe more valuable the\nwork done is perceived\nto be, the more money it\nreceives as compensation.\nIf we have a situation\nthat more and more\nindividuals have greater\ncompensation for work\ndone, more individuals\nwill be able to purchase\nmore goods and services.\nHowever, if the goods and\nservices are limited, the\ndemand will be greater\nthan the supply of goods\nand services increasing\nprices and hence money\nwould be deemed to have\nlost its value. Such situations bring up comments\nlike \u201cback in my day this\nused to cost\u2026 but now it\u2019s\nso expensive\u201d. That is an\nexample of inflation. The\nsame is true when we say\nthe goods and services\nhave greater perceived\nvalue, we are referring to\nthe demand for goods and\nservices concerning the\nmoney supply.\nSome of you may have\nnoticed the use of the\nword \u201cperceived\u201d in my\nsentence above and the\nreason is that in general\nthe cost associated with a\nparticular good or service,\nlogically should have gone\ndown with the advancement in technology and\nthe global supply chain.\nHowever, that is not the\ncase, so this must mean\nthat there are other factors\nat play. One such factor\nis the perceived value of\ngoods and services.\nPerceived Value\nIt is the customers\u2019 valuation of the product and\nits value. For example,\na product might cost 50\npounds to manufacture,\nbut be sold for much more\nbecause consumers have a\nhigher perceived value of\nthe product. If the product\nwas sold for less then its\nperceived value; consumers might not purchase it,\nfor fear that it is inferior.\nThe common scenario is\nwhen we discuss brands\nand how that adds a\npremium to the product\ncost. Other scenarios\nworth exploring is the\ncost of similar products or\nproducts that came before\nit. The logical thought\nprocess is that with an advancement in manufactur-ing, cost of manufacturing\nhas gone down, yet we see\nthat newer products are\nmore expensive. While\nthey might have more\ncomplex features, but if\nthe cost of producing the\nnewer product is lower\nthen its predecessor, then\nthe factor at play is more\npsychological. And it is\ndue to the consumers\u2019\nperceived value of the\nproduct. Another factor\nis the increase in money\nsupply in the market.\nMoney Supply\nThe money supply in\nthe market in most cases\nis controlled by a central\nbank. The central banks\nhave several instruments\nto do this. First being able\nto set interest rates, which\ndetermines the cost of\nborrowing. This cost of\nborrowingisnotforclients\nof private and commercial\nbanks. It is the cost of\nborrowing money from\nthe central bank by private\nand commercial banks.\nAnd banks use this information to set their interest\nrates (usually higher)\nfor their clients. So why\nwould the banks borrow\nmoney from the central\nbank? Short answer, they\nusually don\u2019t, because\nand within themselves.\nThe banks have what we\ncall an interbank rate.\nWhich is more favourable\nthen open market rates\n(the rates that you and I\nsee when getting a loan)\nbut usually higher than\ncentral bank rates. Why\ndo they need to borrow?\nOne reason is to satisfy\nthe reserve requirement\nor reserve ratio, which we\nwill explore next.\nAnother tool central\nbanks use is reserve\nrequirement or reserve\nratio. It is the amount of\nmoney banks must keep\nas a ratio/percentage of\ntheir total holdings. The\nnext question you might\nhave is \u201cI thought the\nbank keeps my money, so\nI don\u2019t have to stuff it in\nmy mattress\u201d. Well, that\u2019s\nnot the case, this is where\nthe magic happens. The\nbank takes your money\nand lends a portion of it\nas loans. However, the\nmoney that you place in\nthe bank, on paper, is still\nin your account. This does\ntwo things it provides an\nincome to banks in the\nformofloansand\u201ccreates\u201d\nnew money. This is where\nthe on-paper definition is\nimportant. Imagine you\nhave 100 pounds in your\nbank account. Now what\nhappens, is your bank\nwill take a portion of that\naccording to the reserve\nrequirement and loan\nit out. And it loans out\n90 pounds. The person\nit loans the 90 pounds\nto, places that money\nin their bank account.\nNow assuming that both\naccounts are held by the\nbank. The bank has a total\nof 190 pounds on paper\nin its holdings. And with\nthat, the bank takes that\n190 pounds and loans\nout a portion of that. This\nprocess becomes a cycle\nand \u201ccreates\u201d money. And\nthe bank has a growth in\nthe amount of money on\npaper in its holdings and\nthe money supply in the\neconomy increases. At\nthe same time, it creates\nmultiple streams of\nincome through multiple\nloans.Thebanks,however,\nmust ensure that it must\nphysically have money\nin its vaults to satisfy the\nreserve requirements.\nWhen the loans are paid,\nthe money is \u201cdestroyed\u201d;\nnot actually because it\nwas credit (debt) to being\nwith, i.e. it did not exist.\nThe money supply would\nthen decrease. You will\nnotice that banks pay you\na small interest rate to\nkeep the money in your\naccount and that most\nlikely comes from the\nrevenue generated from\nthe loans they issued and\nit is an incentive to keep\nyour money with the bank.\nTake note\nDifferent systems\nmanage the money supply,\nlike in the European Union\nfor example, which has a\nsystem of multiple central\nbanks and the American\nFederal Reserve (FED)\nand the treasury. The FED\nhas recently decreased its\nrate, making it cheaper to\nborrow and introducing\nmore money (in the form\nof credit) into the market\nto stimulate the economy,\namidst the coronavirus\noutbreak around the\nworld.\nThe reserve require\u201cIf the product\nwas sold for\nless then its\nperceived\nvalue;\nconsumers\nmight not\npurchase it, for\nfear that it is\ninferior\u201d\nment is not something\ncentral banks typically\nchange, but it is done in\nChina by the People\u2019s\nBank of China (China\u2019s\ncentral bank), to control\nits money supply. And\nif you read my earlier ar\nticle on trade, I briefly\ntouched on why some\ncurrencies are worth more\nthan others. (hint: it\u2019s\ndemand and supply but\nwith the desired currency\nas the good that you are\nbuying with your country\u2019s currency).\nFurther readings\nConsumer price index\n(CPI), is the weighted\naverage of prices of\nconsumer goods and\nservices and it is used in\nthe calculation of infla\u201cI thought the\nbank keeps\nmy money, so\nI don\u2019t have to\nstuff it in my\nmattress [...]\nThe bank takes\nyour money\nand lends a\nportion of it as\nloans\u201d\n\u201cThe reserve\nrequirement is\nnot something\ncentral banks\ntypically\nchange, but\nit is done in\nChina by the\nPeople\u2019s Bank\nof China\u201d\nit implies that they are\nfacing financal difficulty\nand might lead to an investigation into the bank.\nIn the event they require\nmoney, the banks would\nborrow from each other\n\u201cThe banks,\nhowever,\nmust ensure\nthat it must\nphysically\nhave money\nin its vaults\nto satisfy\nthe reserve\nrequirements\u201d\ntion. Arguably not the best\nmeasure of inflation on an\ninduvial level, due to different consumer spending\nhabits. For example, if\nthe products you have\nbeen purchasing has not\ngone up in price for years\ncompared to someone else\nwho has seen an increase\nin cost for their purchases.\nThen one could almost\nsay that inflation is different for you as compared to\nsomeone else.\n\n"

In\nparticular, we saw\nthe women of WIST\ndiscarding the term\n\u2018feminist\u2019 as akin or\nidentical to being\n\u2018militant\u2019 - showing\nthat there was still a\nlong way to go.\nEnjoy this section? We hope to continue diving into\nthe archives to explore Felix and the College\u2019s history\nwith social issues. Get in touch and let us know your\nthoughts and if you\u2019d like to be involved!\n\n"

The team\nhope to map the brain\u2019s\nresponse over time, so\nchanges preceding a\nmigraine can be mapped.\nIt is thought that this monitoring can help predict\nmigraines and support\npreventative measures.\nFrom Plastic Jellyfish\nto Plastic Smellyfish\nA paper published this\nweek in Current Biology\nrevealed that Loggerhead\nsea turtles have a similar\nresponse to the smell of\nplastic waste as they do\nto food scents. This gives\ninsight into the mystery\nas to why sea turtles are\nattracted to plastic and\nend up ingesting it or\nbecoming trapped in it. It\nsupersedes visual-based\ntheories, such as the\n\u2018plastic-jellyfish\u2019 hypothesis which proposed\nthat floating plastic bags\nwere mistakenly ingested\ndue to their similarity\nto jellyfish. The study\npresented odours of\nturtle food, water, clean\nplastic, or bio-fouled\nplastic to Loggerhead\nturtles and monitored\ntheir movement towards\nthe odours. Bio-fouled\nplastic \u2013 plastic exposed\nto micro- and macrobiota\nfor five weeks \u2013 elicited\na response \u2018indistinguishable\u2019 from that of turtle\nfood.\nDr Octopus Brought\nto Life \u2013 or at least,\none tentacle is\nLate February saw\na development in soft\nrobotics, as a team from\nHarvard and Beihang\nUniversity created an\noctopus-inspired arm \u2013\ncomplete with suction\npads. The robotic arm\nmimics the tapered design\nof an octopus tentacle,\nand is the first to combine\nthis with a bending\nmotion and suction pads,\nmeaning added flexibility\nand finer control. Directed\nby a change in pressure\nto control the arm\u2019s bend,\nand vacuum to activate the\nsuction pads, it can safely\nhandle a wider variety of\nobjects than its predeces-sors, including delicate,\nodd-shaped items like\neggs and test tubes.\nLongevity Found to\nbe a Universal Truth\nWomen live longer than\nmen \u2013 this fact generally\nholdstrueacrosstheglobe,\nalthough women\u2019s health\nin some countries is significantly down-trodden\ncompared to this average.\nNow, reported in Biology\nLetters earlier this month,\nscientists found that this\nrule also applies across\nthe animal kingdom.\nThe team reviewed 229\nspecies and found that\non average, the sex with\nmatching chromosomes\nhad a 17.6% longer\nlifespan. Possession of\nmatching chromosomes\nis thought to confer\nprotection from genetic\nmutations, by access to\na second, \u2018clean\u2019, copy.\nHowever, not all animals\nhave an X and Y based\nsex chromosome system\n\u2013 for instance, birds and\nreptiles have a ZW based\nsystem, where males\npossess the matching pair\n(ZZ). In instances where\nthe male gender possessed\nthe matching pair, the\nlifespan gain dropped to\njust over 7%, suggesting\nthere is something else at\nplay\u2026\n\u201cScientists\nfound that\nthe sex with\nmatching\nchromosomes\nhad a 17.6%\nlonger\nlifespan\u201d\n\u201cBio-fouled\nplastic elicited\na response\n\u2018indinstinguishable from\nthat of turtle\nfood\u201d\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!
