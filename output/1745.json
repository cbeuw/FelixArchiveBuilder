The wait is over now, the cat is out of the\nbag. It\u2019s time for Felix to give its seminal take. Fasten your seatbelts, girls and boys.\nMUSIC\nI don\u2019t like sand. It\u2019s coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere! - Kevin Skywalker, 2020 // Modular\nRecords\nPlease remove sand from property or deposit deduction will ensue! // Modular\nRecords\nT\nime. One of the\nmost baffling\nand psychedelic\nconcepts and one\nthat every single one of us\nmust deal with. Musings\non the theme have occupied so many artists.\nIt comes as a logical\nconclusion to a fact that\nwe all have to deal with:\nwe\u2019re all slowly running\nout of time. How much of\nit we have, and what the\npossibilities held by this\nlimited and unquantifiable\nreserve are, no one knows.\nSo much stress is\ncaused by the impression\nthat time is closing in on\nus. Maybe you didn\u2019t have\na productive day at work,\nmaybe making dinner took\nlonger than it should have\nand now you can\u2019t go to\nthe gym or your kids are\nscreaming, or your stove\nis on fire... We each face\nour own time-dimension\ndifficulties. Kevin Parker,\nthe Tame Impala frontman\nand de-facto one-man\nband, kicks off The Slow\nRush with a number that\ncontemplates the value of\nroutine in a relationship\nin the context of passing\ntime. \u2018One More Year\u2019\nopens with a questionable\nheavily-gated deep male\nchorus, which carries\nthrough to the end of the\nsong, and introduces a\nmain theme of the album\n\u2013 doubt.\nIf we take Kevin\u2019s\npersonal story arc, it can\nbe retold in plain terms\nas the coming of age\nof a confused introvert\nfiguring out how to fit in\nin the world. As he has\nbecome more successful,\ncementing his name in\nrock history, his outlook\nhas changed somewhat.\nTrying to shed light on\nhis new life throughout\nthe LP, he manages to toe\nthe line between ironic\nself-awareness and soppi-ness successfully for the\nmost part, while failing\nspectacularly in places.\nIt just so happens that\nthrough the passage of\ntime, with more and more\nthings seemingly falling\ninto place, the things he\nis doubting have become\nmore banal. But have they\nreally? If past actions are\nirreversible, and we have\nan ever-growing backlog\nof these, do doubts\nbecome less pertinent or\ndo they just accumulate?\nAn important breaking\npoint in the album comes\nwith the lead single, and\nin our opinion one of the\nhighlights of the album,\n\u2018Borderline\u2019. By looking\nat the cover art we constantly encounter surrealist scenes of rooms filled\nwith sand. Doors lead us\nto the outside \u2013 more sand,\nopen sky. Other doors lead\nus inside \u2013 more doors,\nmore sand. It is an obvious\nallusion to surrealist art,\nwhere doors and windows\nhad an important role as\na symbol of the break of\ncontinuity between space\nand time \u2013 often also a\nbreak with reality. \u201cThen\nI saw the time // Watched\nit speedin\u2019 by like a train\u201d.\nThis particular line from\n\u2018Borderline\u2019 concretely\nties the focus back to the\ntheme of time, and the\nhourglass-esque landscape of the artwork. We\nnow know that the borderline Kevin has found\nhimself on is one of different timelines, different\nlevels of existence. On a\nmusical level, the song is\none of the better examples\nof Kevin\u2019s newfound love\nfor bongos, featuring a\npunchier bass than the\nsingle version, and vocal\neffects which complement\nthe self-doubting questioning in the bridge and\noutro.\nThe turning point in\nthe album\u2019s story almost\nfeels like an epiphany,\nand is emphasised by the\nfollow-up, the dryly-titled\n\u2018Posthumous Forgiveness\u2019. The gist of the\nsong is that Kevin has no\nmeans to confront his late\nfather (who passed away\nduring the recording of\nTame Impala\u2019s first album\nInnerspeaker) for the lies\nhe told him growing up.\nA child of divorce, his\nparents\u2019 splitting must\nhave been a profound\ninfluence on his outlook\non love, subsequently\nshaping the lens through\nwhich we as an audience\npeer into his life. The first\nfour minutes are dark,\nbrooding, and stretched\nto the breaking point,\nwhereupon the saw lead\nnosedives into the bongos,\nand an airy melody lifts\nthe mood \u2013 similarly\nto \u2018Sun\u2019s Coming Up\u2019\nfrom Lonerism. Kevin\nstops being accusatory\nand instead feels sadness\nfor not being able to\ntell his father about all\nthe amazing things that\nhave happened to him. A\nchange of perspective; the\nend of doubt?\nThe section following\ncould be called \u201cKevin\nParker\u2019s self-help\nmedley\u201d.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX ISSUE 1745\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nWay to Go\nthis year than it has been previously \u2013 and what the advantages of student-led events are\ntheir \u00a350. People always\nfelt that the standard of\nthe DJ was subpar. That\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019ve changed those\nthings.\u201d\nSam Lee, the Technical\nDirector for DramSoc\nand also the Arts and\nEnts Treasurer, added:\n\u201cI\u2019ve read responses\nfrom last year, a lot of\nwhich said they didn\u2019t\nfeel like they were getting\nvalue-for-money. There\nwasn\u2019t any conversation\nwith students happening;\nthe team in charge just\ndecided what was happening and didn\u2019t run\nvery much consultation.\nConsidering we are a students\u2019 union, I found that\ninteresting. It feels like\nthere is a lot of distrust in\nthe Union, and in Union\nevents, as a result.\u201d\nAs a result, responding\nto feedback became a\ncore part of the committee\u2019s priorities. The\n\u2018Enchanted Forest\u2019 theme\nwas selected based on\npopularity and feasibility\nfrom an open submission\nconsultation that Fifi ran\nearlier in the year. The\nfeasibility played a large\npart in the decision, which\nis where DramSoc \u2013 as\nthe technical specialists \u2013\nhad strong input. Equally,\nthe committee decided\nto increase the set design\nbudget by over eightfold,\nfrom \u00a3400 last year to\n\u00a33000.\nA core result of this\nshift in perspective, and\nthe student-led approach,\nwas the decision to run\nthe Ball not as a commercial venture, but rather as\na break-even event whose\nfocus was to provide the\nbest possible experience\nto students. This decision\nwas taken after the budget\npitch to the Union\u2019s\nBoard of Trustees, who\nsupported the conceptual\nadaptation and gave the\ngo-ahead.\nThis has allowed for\nthe inclusion of new\nfeatures, such as food and\na prosecco reception, for\na modest ticket price increase \u2013 which, according\nto the committee, would\nnot have been possible in\nprevious years due to the\nneed to turn a profit.\naspects \u2013 I\u2019ve had my say\nin the theme of the ball\nand even voting on our\nchosen headliner.\n\u201cThis year, student\nmanagers that have also\nbeen on the committee have been largely\ninvolved in contacting\nsponsors, with the help of\nour full time bar staff, to\ndrum up some really great\ndrink deals and additional\nbars and set-pieces.\n\u201cEqually, being involved from winter term\nhas also allowed better\npreparation from a bar\nperspective. Mapping\nout the bar layouts and\ndeveloping budgets will\nmake us better equipped\nto deliver an efficient\nservice on the night.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Sam Lee\nsaid that it has drastically\nimproved opportunities\nfor creativity with the set\ndesign:\n\u201cPreviously, a lot of\nour work in terms of\nlighting design happened\nover the Easter break and\nover the third term. That\nwasn\u2019t much liaising and\nconsultation with us; for\nthe most part it was \u2018get\nit done\u2019 with what we had\nbeen given.\n\u201cWhat makes the\nSummer Ball so good is\nthat even though you\u2019re in\nImperial, you can forget\nyou\u2019re in Imperial. You\ncan block out the fact\nthat you were sitting in\nthe Great Hall stressed\nover your exam a week\nbefore. A big part of that\nis set design, which we\nare responsible for, and\nthe increase in budget\nfor that this year will\nmake a big difference.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got so many\nideas, from a massive\nteam from DramSoc and\nthe Art Club, and with\nthe budget we can really\nshift the opinion of the\nBall and bring it up to a\nnew level. Being involved\nfrom the get-go has upped\nquality by opening the\nspace for more people\nto get involved, to let\ntheir creative sides out.\nConsidering the technical\nside before picking your\ntheme also makes a huge\ndifference; by picking a\ntheme that we know we\ncan deliver really well on,\nthe result will be much\nmore cohesive.\u201d\nOf course, students\ntaking up the work comes\nwith a cost. The level\nof time commitment is\nhigh, and with the need to\njuggle degrees on top, it\nhas not been easy. As Sam\nLee said:\n\u201cLast term, it was once\na week for two hours on\na Monday to brainstorm,\nso it wasn\u2019t too time-in-tensive, but it increases\nwhen it comes to the\norganisation period. What\nwe could benefit from is\nmore staff support in that\narea, as it\u2019s time-con-suming to email, phone\npeople, and so on, so it\u2019s\nstill student-run but less\nintensive for us.\u201d\nHowever, staff support\nhas not been absent in\nother areas. While stu-dent-led, various members\nof the Union team, and\neven the College, have\ncontributed to publicising\nand organising the Ball.\nFifi elaborated:\n\u201cThe marketing team\nhave been really engaged\nand have put out some\ngreat publicity material;\nalso, the Operations\nManager and the full-time bar staff have been\nengaged with us to discuss\nhow the venue will look\nand how to plan ahead.\nThe Head of Student\nExperience has been\nincredibly supportive as\nwell, any chance he has to\noffer support it is always\nthere. College has been\nexcellent too, especially\nwith health and safety.\u201d\nIn wake of the changes,\nthere have been learning\nexperiences on the way \u2013\nlessons that the committee\nhope will be taken forward\nto next year.\n\u201cThere is still room for\nimprovement on how and\nwhere we consult with\nstudents; there\u2019s the set of\nstudents who are engaged\nmore as part of a CSP or\nthe Union\u2019s structures,\nbut that\u2019s not always your\naverage student,\u201d Fifi said.\n\u201cIf we can find a way to\nreally effectively engage\nwith as many students as\npossible, we\u2019re absolutely\ngoing to do that \u2013 I would\nlove to have more students\non the committee next\nyear too.\n\u201cI\u2019d like there to\nbe another position or\ntwo on the committee\nfor a non-relevant CSP\nmember, so that any\nstudent can get involved. I\ncan set the groundwork for\nthat now, and begin thinking about how you would\nselect those students, and\nthe next DPFS can decide\nhow to implement it.\nLastly, if we can have\na Hub for the Summer\nBall Committee, with\nlots of information and\nupdates, it will be easier\nfor students to know\nwhy changes are being\nmade, and we can answer\nquestions directly \u2013 rather\nthan them going to Imperial College Exposed\nand asking why the prices\nhave increased. We could\nalso use it to put out more\nconsultations earlier, right\nfrom Welcome Week.\u201d\nHowever, each committee member expressed\nwholeheartedly that the\ndesire to produce an\nexcellent experience for\ntheir peers \u2013 and to prove\nthat driving events with\nstudent input coming first\nis the way to go \u2013 was\nworth overcoming every\ndifficulty or challenge. As\nJoe put it:\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing it so that\nwe can give our peers a\nBall that they will hopefully remember long after\nthey\u2019ve left university.\nFor me, a student led Ball\nis the way forward. This\nyear is about proving\na point, next year, who\nknows. I hope that this can\nprovide a platform for the\nball to now start growing\nand growing, with every\nsuccessive committee\nbringing new and more\nambitious ideas to the\ntable. We\u2019re never going\nto have a \u2018May Ball\u2019 at\nImperial but maybe, with\nthe right set of students\nleading it, we can create\nsomething of our own that\npeople will be proud to\nshout about.\n\u201cThis is us creating\nsomething for our fellow\nstudents, whereas it felt\nin previous years like the\nUnion taking advantage\nof its volunteers, not treating them with the respect\nand level of gratitude that\nthey deserved, and then\ndelivering something kind\nof underwhelming.\u201d\nIt will have to be seen\nwhether the fruits of the\ncommittee\u2019s labours will\nproduce a top-tier Summer\nBall. However, it is undoubtedly insightful to\nhear their story, the trials\nand tribulations of organising such a large-scale\nevent, and the benefits of\nbringing students to the\nfore of Union planning.\n\u201cIt seemed\ninsane that\ndecisions were\nbeing made\nwithout the\npeople who\nthe decisions\naffected being\nin the room\u201d\nBeyond just a change\nin the financial budgeting\nperspective, each of the\nfour people Felix spoke\nto agreed that the new\ndecision-making format\nresulted in a higher level\nof involvement and direction from themselves.\nAll of them agreed that in\nprevious years, students\nhad not had any real input\ninto the running of the\nevent, and felt it being\nstudent-led will generate\nmuch better results by\ndrawing on their expertise and connection to\nthe student base. As Joe\nsaid, \u201cit seemed insane\nthat decisions were being\nmade without the people\nwho the decisions affected\nbeing in the room.\u201d\nSam Hammond, one of\nthe Beit Bars managers,\nsaid:\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get\nany input last year, which\nis in huge contrast to\nthe committee this year.\nFrom the get-go, I\u2019ve\nbeen involved in decision\nmaking, and it hasn\u2019t\njust been on bar-related\n\u201cWe are doing\nit so that\nwe can give\nour peers a\nBall they will\nremember\nlong after\nthey've left\nuniversity\u201d\n\n"

What\nwere the Net\ufb02ix\nexecutives on\nwhen green-lighting the mess that is\nthis show? Following the\nworldwide success of The\nCircle (think Big Brother\nmeets Cat\ufb01sh) - the UK\nversion airs on Channel 4\nwhereas the US/international version of broadcast\non Net\ufb02ix - comes a brand\nnew relationship-focused\nreality show, clearly a\nstrategic attempt from the\nstreaming giant to step\ninto the unscripted show\nmarket.\nCalling \u2018Love is Blind\u2019\nbatshit crazy would be an\nunderstatement. The show\ncombines the ever-so-pop-ular \u2018blind dating\u2019 format\nwith a sprinkle of \u2018The\nBachelor\u2019 franchise,\ndumping a group of men\nand a group of women in\nseparate houses, asking\nthem to \ufb01nd the love of\ntheir lives by chatting to\neach other from their own\nlittle \u2018pods\u2019, and not being\nable to see each other until\nthey are engaged. As if\nthat\u2019s not absurd enough,\nthey only have about a\nweek to decide who they\nwant to marry and about\na month to actually walk\ndown the aisle.\nOver the \ufb01rst couple\nof episodes, relationships\nare formed, proposals are\nmade; a fuckboy needs to\nchoose between the three\nwomen he\u2019s promised\nto marry, and hearts are\nbroken. Some contestants\nget next to no airtime\n(they must be exceptionally boring), and by the end\nof the third episode, they\nare completely out of the\nshow, which now focuses\non \ufb01ve newly betrothed\ncouples and how their relationships develop or fall\napart, in the real world.\nPerhaps the most ludicrous part of the show is\nwatching people who\u2019ve\nnever seen each other talk\nabout wanting to have\nkids together one minute,\nto the same people considering marrying different\npeople within the next.\nOne of the main issues\nwith the show is that it is\nextremely heteronorma-tive. Granted, given the\npremise of the show, it is\ndif\ufb01cult to create an environment where gay and\nstraight relationships can\nco-exist without complete\nsegregation. However,\nthe show doesn\u2019t even\nattempt to overcome this\nproblem. Instead, the only\nLGBT representation is\na bisexual man who gets\ndumped by his \u2018\ufb01anc\u00e9e\u2019\nfor \u2018not being honest\u2019\nupon revealing his sexuality on a couples retreat\nin Mexico following their\nengagement.\nFrom the get-go,\nnot only are the \u2018pod\u2019\nconversations hilariously\nfaux-deep, but so are\nthe running commentary\nprovided by the contest-ants. The producers of the\nshow must really want the\naudience to remember the\nexact premise of the show,\nhence the contestants\nkeep repeating things like\n\u2018I never thought I\u2019d be\nengaged to someone ten\nyears younger than me\u2019 or\n\u2018as a black woman, I\u2019ve\nnever dated a white man,\nbut I\u2019ve fallen in love with\nwho he is inside and that\u2019s\nall that matters\u2019. All the\ndamn time. Frankly, the\nshow\u2019s insistence to treat\nthe audience as complete\nidiots, having the need to\nre-explain the premise a\nmillion times is perhaps\nwhat makes the show\ninsufferable at times.\nAdditionally, despite\nmaking a point that appearances don\u2019t matter,\nit sure does feel awfully\nconvenient that almost\nevery single person cast\nin the show is objectively\ngood looking. Watching\nhot people complain that\npeople only want to date\nthem for their looks is a\nproblem that most of us\ncan\u2019t relate to. Therefore,\nthe show comes a mile\nshort of proving their\nhypothesis that love is\nindeed blind, as none of\nthe contestants need to\nchoose whether to stay\nwith their \ufb01anc\u00e9(e) based\non their looks.

The premise is\ncompletely ridiculous,\nand while the execution is\nspotty at best, it is wildly\nentertaining. The show\nmakes some attempts\nto dig deeper into some\nprofound territory but\nnever quite makes it there.\nHowever, the overall lack\nof depth makes \u2018Love Is\nBlind\u2019 an easy watch to\nroll your eyes to many\ntimes per episode.

Ideally, there would\nbe a new deal with the EU\nwhich is beneficial to both\nparties. That\u2019s what is\nwhat all this fuss is about.\nWe\u2019ll need to have this\ndeal in place by the end\nof the transition period on\n31st\nDecember 2020. The\nUK is seeking to create\na free trade agreement\n(FTA) which aims to\nencourage trade between\ncountries by removing\ntariffs and not putting\ncaps on the amount that\ncan be traded. However,\nsome tariffs and quotas\nare usually needed to stop\ntoo many cheap exports\ndamaging a country\u2019s\nmanufacturers. Even if\nthe UK and EU managed\nto create an FTA, there\u2019d\nstill be border checks as\nit\u2019s not frictionless trade.\nThis means countries\ncan still make their own\nrules on safety regulations\nand standards. Currently\nthis doesn\u2019t happen as\nwe\u2019re all under the same\neconomic zone: the single\nmarketandcustomsunion.\nThis single set of rules\nalso guarantees the free\nmovement of services,\npeople and capital.\nAfter leaving the EU,\nthe UK would then have\nthe power to create its\nown set of rules and no\nlonger follow those set\nby Brussels. The price to\npay for this is having a\nfew extra border checks.\nThe UK would like to\n\u201cthe UK\ndoesn\u2019t want\nto impose\ntari\ufb00s or\nquotas...the\nmajority of\nimports will\nremain tari\ufb00\nfree\u201d\nFELIX\nset up an agreement that\nbenefits both us and the\nEU to stop trade barriers\ncoming into effect at the\nend of the year. The EU,\nhowever, wants to make\nan example out of us so\nthat none of the other\nwealthy countries see that\nwe\u2019re actually doing fine\nwithout the EU and also\ndecide to leave.\nThe UK doesn\u2019t want\nto impose tariffs or\nquotas. In fact, under a\nhard Brexit, where no\ntrade agreement is set up\nand the default agreement\nis that of the World Trade\nOrganisation (WTO), the\nUK has already stated that\nthe majority of imports\nwill remain tariff free. The\nUK could potentially have\nzero tariffs on exports\nto the EU however they\nrequire that we do not\nsell any of our products at\ncompetitively low prices.\nRecently there\u2019s been\ntalks of a Canada style\ntrade deal. Canada has an\nFTA with the EU known\nas the Comprehensive\nEconomic Trade Agreement (CETA) which\nmeans most imported\ngoods aren\u2019t taxed. There\nare only a few quotas on\ncertain things such as\nfood and a few customs\nchecks. Canada also does\nnot have to pay into the\nEU\u2019s budget and so the\ndrawback of this deal is\nthe lack of freedom of\nmovement for people and\ncapital. This seems like a\nreasonable deal for the UK\nand EU to set up, right?\nWell, the EU did offer this\ndeal back in 2017 but has\nsince reneged.\nBoris Johnson remains\nadamant that there is no\nneed to accept an FTA if\nthe conditions were to\nagree to the EU rules of\ncompetition, subsidies,\nsocial protection and the\nenvironment. Johnson\nalso stressed that if they\nwere not able to agree on\nthe Canada style agreement then trade would be\nbased off the WTO rules.\nThis means that if we\nchoose to not put tariffs on\nY\nou hear the term\ntrade deal a lot.\nEspecially with\nregards to the\nUK and EU\u2019s trade deal\nnow that we\u2019ve finally\npissed off from the EU.\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve heard\nabout the trade war between the USA and China.\nBut what is it?\nIn simple terms, it\u2019s just\nan agreement between\nJinay Patel\nICIS\nInvestment Co-Editor\ngoods from the EU, then\nthe same applies for goods\nfrom every WTO member.\nThere will be no deals and\na strong likelihood of high\ntariffs on exports.\nSo, it seems that if\nthe UK and EU cannot\nagree on some form of\nthe EU-Canada deal, then\nwe\u2019re heading towards a\nhard no deal Brexit where\nthe above rules will apply.\nAn unfavourable outcome\nfor everyone.\ntwo folks that states the\nrules under which they\nexport their goods and\nservices.

Meet\nthe Candidates is an\nannual debate organised\nand hosted by ICTV, IC\nRadio and Felix, and\naims to allow you, the\nelectorate an opportunity to come face to face\nwith the people that\nwant to represent you to\nthe powers that be, both\nin the Union and the col-lege. If you aren\u2019t sure\nwho to vote for after\npainstakingly combing\nthrough manifestos then\nthis is the event for you.\nThe sabbatical roles\nthat will be taking part\nin the debate are the\nFelix Editor, the Deputy\nPresident for Education,\nthe Deputy President\nfor Welfare, the Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and\nSocieties, the Deputy\nPresident for Finance and\nthe Union President. Candidates will be given an\nallotted amount of time to\noutline their manifestos,\nbefore being asked questions given by the Felix\nand IC radio team, as well\nas fielding queries from\nthe audience. The event\nwill be livestreamed over\nFacebook, from the Felix\nand Union accounts. If\nyou can\u2019t be a part of the\nphysical audience, tune in\nonline to watch the sabbs\nsweat.\nThe overall aim of\nthis event is to give the\nwannabe sabbs a good\nold-fashioned grilling\nover their manifesto\nproposals for the year to\ncome and their suitability\nfor the role with a side of\nexpert commentary from\nUnion hacks, prominent\nsociety members and stu-dents. Come along and be\na part of it all, from 15:00-18:00 in Metric. It\u2019s your\ndemocracy: hold them to\naccount.\n2\nEDITORIAL\nCharlie Titmuss\nDeputy Editor\nVote, Damn You, Vote!\nB\nefore reading\nthis mini-ed-itorial, I suggest reading\nthe above by my trusty\nDeputy Editor, Charlie\nTitmuss, in which he\ntalks about the Meet the\nCandidates event next\nweek. Or, as I like to\nthink of it, a gladiatoral\nbattle of words between\ncandidates for the sabbatical roles that can\nbe almost barb-tongued\nenough to draw blood.\nNegafelix's famed 'Vice\nProvost (Bloodsports)'\ncan almost get off to it,\nit's so sharp.\nThis editorial, I want\nto revisit a message I\ngave during my lecture\nshoutouts last year while\nrunning for this election.\nBack then, I believed\nfully that nobody voted\nhere, having not seen the\nelection turnout results.\nHalfway through my cam-paign, I was enlightened\nas to the turnout numbers.\nStill, they can be misleading - voting for one role\ncounts you as part of the\nturnout, which is fine, but\nmeans that a lot of roles\ndon't get as many votes as\none would like.\nSo during that cam-paign, I was doing lecture\nshoutouts, and I was less\nthinking how to strategically gain an advantage\nover my opponents\nand more just trying to\nencourage students to\nvote for my role, and for\nevery role. I was earnest,\nimpassioned, and sincere\nas I stood before all of you\nand asked you to turn up\nand contribute.\nSee, there are all sorts\nof problems with not\nvoting. I won't delve too\nmuch into the democratic\nissues that arise when a\nlimited segment of the\npopulation bothers to\nvote. Brexit is already\nthe perfect example of\nthat - regardless of your\nperspective, the idea that\na quarter of the population actually voting for\nsomething and having\nthat pass into law, either\nway the vote goes, is a\nbit problematic. So vote,\nbecause that's the only\nway democracy doesn't\ncrumble before our eyes.\nAnd democracy is broadly\npretty good. Or, rather,\nit's not as bad as all the\nother ways we've found of\nrunning countries.\nI want to talk more\nabout how it affects you\ndirectly, as a student.\nNamely, it shapes literally\neverything about your\nstudent experience.\nI was a student completely disconnected from\nthe Union for most of my\ndegree - one of those who\nslips through the cracks,\ndoesn't read emails. I\nbecame interested via my\ninvolvement with Felix,\nbut was still largely ignorant until I began this role\nin September and found\nthat I had to learn how\neverything worked very\nquickly in order to report\non campus events.\nWhat I've seen has\ngenuinely surprised me.\nStudent volunteers at the\nUnion work really hard,\nguys.\nNow that's not a reason\nto vote in itself. It does,\nhowever, segue nicely\ninto my real point.\nJust because you do not\nsee what the Union does\nfor you does not mean it\ndoes not affect you. Don't\nbe jaded.\nThis year, the Union\nhas fought hard to reduce\nrent for first year students.\nThey're negotiating the\nblock grant that directly\nfunds every single club\nand society. They got\nthe College to implement ethical investment\npolicies. They worked\non the Harlington sports\ngrounds. They pushed the\nCollege to respect NSS\nresults They took over the\nSummer Ball and made\nit student-led. Academic\nand wellbeing reps have\nbeen there for you every\nstep of the way, in every\nmeeting, fighting your\ncorner where they can.\nThey did a lot of stuff,\nthat will genuinely and invariably impact you. Your\ndegree, your finances,\nyour hobbies. So f*cking\nvote for people who'll\nkeep doing that for you. It\ntakes just a few seconds.\nEDITORIAL\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY, 28TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\n8\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHas the labour movement failed to engage\nyoung people?\nOn the eve of the labour leadership elections, a consideration of the participation of young\npeople in the labour movement.\nCOMMENT\nMaeve Johnston\nComment Writer\nD\nespite the\nbarnstorming\nsuccess of\nC o r b y n \u2019 s\nlabour party with young\npeople in the 2019 elec-tions, with 56% of 18-24\nyear olds voting for the\nparty, Union participation\nis low amongst young\npeople - in 2018 only\n4.4% of the Unionised\nworkforce was aged\n16-24. Given the leftist,\nred flag waving rhetoric\nof the party, and the close\nrelationship and backing\nof trade unions, this seems\ncounter-intuitive.\nOf course not all\nyoung Labour voters are\nleftist ideologues. The\nparty\u2019s manifesto for\nyoung people focussed\non the climate crisis,\nmental health treatment\nand (broadly) equality\nand a policy focus on\nyoung people, stepping\naway from labour\nmovement issues in all\nbut a commitment to a\n\u00a310 universal minimum\nwage.The election result\nwas also driven by Brexit,\nthe Labour anti-semetism\ncrisis and the personality and draw and of both\nCorbyn and Johnson.\nThe cult of the hustle,\nof entrepreneurship and\nconverting hobbies and\nevery waking minute into\na source of value, has\nseemingly pervaded youth\nculture, at the expense\nof critical evaluation of\nthe toll this can take both\nmentally and physically\nand how well this can\nplay into exploitative employment practices such\nas \u2018flexible\u2019 zero hours\ncontracts and unpaid\ninternships. From sites\nlike Depop to the careers\nservice encouraging club\nparticipation on the CV,\nwe cannot escape labour\nand optimising ourselves\nto participate. This is also\na culture of individualism\n- how can I make myself\nas employable, as unique\nas possible? In this envi-ronment, trade unionism,\nreliant on collective\naction and some degree\nof resistance (rather than\ncapitulation) to employers\ncannot flourish. \u2018Collective action\u2019 when it does\noccur, in the form of\nChange.org petitions is\nmerely an artifice that\ngives the signatories\nsome feeling of power,\nas is waiting for officials\nelected on the promise of\nimproving workers rights\nto do so.\nOften union exposure\ncan be through the most\nextreme of their actions -a day off school, a closed\nBakerloo line or a picket\nin front of Blackett due to\nstrike action- whilst these\nevents have inevitably\nmixed consequences and\nreactions, they do little to\ncontextualise the purpose\nand other workings of\nunions. The history of collective action in the UK\n(depending on your per-spective) is rarely seen as\nwholly positive, with the\n3 day working week and\nenergy rationing brought\non by miners strikes in the\n70s having mixed (to say\nthe least) lasting legacies\nin the collective British\npsyche. This is not to say\nthat strike action should\nnot occur, but that unions\nshould engage with the\npublic to communicate\nnot only what collective\naction has achieved in\nthe past, but what it could\ndo for them in the future.\nGeneral secretaries should\naspire to boost their\nprofiles and advocate for\nthe action of their unions\nbeyond leftist media\noutlets where solidarity\nis assumed, preaching\nbeyond the choir.\nThe sectors least union-ised, according to a 2018\nUK BEIS report, are the\nfood and accommodation\nindustries. Young people\nare disproportionately\nrepresented in this sector,\nand according to a recent\nreport, it will be one of\nfew net growth areas in\nterms of employment\nprospects. Summer or\npart time employees at a\nnon-unionised workplace\nsuch as a restaurant or\ncafe may see little appeal\nin the effort of collective\naction, even if working\nconditions are poor. These\njobs are often stepping\nstones to success, sources\nof spending money for\nUni or time management\nskills on the CV. However\nwith the job market as it\nis, this may not be true\nforever as more graduates\nare churned out into\nthe workforce than jobs\nsuitable for their skill\nlevel - in 2017 the ONS\nreported that nearly half of\ngraduates were working\nin non-graduate roles.\nThose employed under\nzero-hours or other similarly precarious contracts\nmay also be dissuaded\nfrom organising with\nthe threat of job loss, or\nhow easily they could be\nreplaced with others in the\nprecariat, desperate for\nmoney and experience.\nDespite these precarity\nworkers having much to\ngain from union membership and organisation,\nthey do not slot well into\ncurrent union structures,\nwhich serve and are\nrepresented in large scale\nemployers and workplaces better than smaller\ncompanies or those where\nthe workforce is largely\nspatially disconnected and\nthus less able to physically organise such as those\nwho work from home or\nusing their own vehicles.\nThe work of having to\nrecruit enough members\nfor a union branch, and\neven choosing a union to\njoin in the first place in a\nworkplace that does not\nfit into the standard offer-ings, will be a barrier to\nsome. This being said, the\nBaker\u2019s Union\u2019s Fast Food\nRights Campaign made\nbranches more flexible to\nenable employees from\ndifferent companies and\nlocations to join collective\ntown centre branches, an\nexample of a union deliberately engaging with\na growing workforce that\nthey have not historically\nrepresented.\nIn short, the labour\nmovement has, on the\nwhole, failed to engage\nwith young people and\nthe changing landscape\nof labour and the culture\nsurrounding it, despite\nhigh youth turnout for\nthe Labour party in 2019.\nSolutions to this are\ntwofold - the established\nunions need to get wise\nto the times by engaging\nwith the discourse surrounding labour by less\npartisan means, and alter\nstructurally to enable\nbetter engagement and\norganisation within traditionally non-unionised\nworkforces that dominate\nthe employment of young\npeople.

We\u2019re\nalso assessing what is\n\u2018core\u2019, looking at what is\nessential from a legal or\nconstitutional perspective,\nfrom a student-need or\n\u2013expectation perspective,\nand then what are \u2018niceto-haves\u2019, things that\nare appreciated but not\ncrucial. We\u2019ll be making\nan assessment of how\nmuch money we need\nbased on that.\nFelix will report on the\nblock grant negotiations\nlater this term.\nFelix: Speaking of the\nManaging Director\nrole, we have a new\ninterim Managing\nDirector at the Union.\nYou work closely with\nthat person, so what\nhas your experience\nbeen with them thus\nfar?\nAS: Whenever a new\nmember of staff is brought\nin, there\u2019s always a bit of\nnervousness, especially\nwhen that new member is\nthe most senior member\nof staff in the Union.\nGraham has completely\nassuaged those nerves.\nHe\u2019s excellent. He takes\nthe student experience\nseriously, he values\nthe opinions of student\nvolunteers and sabbatical\nofficers, he works constructively with staff and I\nbelieve those staff respect\nhim, and he has the right\nexperience previously to\naddress the challenges\nthe Union staff have now.\nHe knows how to start\nhelping and start improving things. He was very\neffective at Westminster\nstudent union last year,\nand they were in a more\ndifficult position than we\nare now beforehand. I\nhave no doubt he\u2019s going\nto be very effective here.\nIt\u2019s very helpful for me.\nSince his predecessor left,\nI\u2019ve been picking up a lot\nof the work internal to the\noffice, and I\u2019ve had to put\nsome of those things ahead\nof work a Union President\nwould normally be doing.\nSo it\u2019s a huge relief, being\nable to be focus on being\na student representative\nfirst-and-foremost again.\nFelix: What kinds of\nthings are you focussing on?\nAS: I\u2019m working on a few\nprojects right now, including on hbar, training for\nstudent volunteers, and\nour complaints process.\nOne of the important\nthings we have going\nright now is a project to\nimprove access to study\nat Imperial for refugees\nand asylum-seekers, at the\nbehest of a PhD student,\nLuciana Miu. We\u2019re\ncollaborating with Advancement in the College\non this.\nFelix: Graham has a\nlot of experience at\nthe NUS, with which\nthe Imperial student\nunion has a long and\ntumultuous history!\nDid that factor in\nto your decision to\nbring him in?\nFor reference, Imperial\nhas joined and left the\nNUS multiple times,\ndespite having been a\nfounding member, and\ncurrently sits outside of\nthe NUS after the most\nrecent student referendum\non the matter in 2008.\nAS: The NUS has been a\ncontroversial organisation\nfor some time, going in\npeaks and troughs. We\ndid ask him about his\nexperience there in the\nHR department, we didn\u2019t\ndodge the question, but\nwe felt his experience\nwould be helpful \u2013 his\ninvolvement with several\nstudent unions and NUS\nputs what we do into\na broader context. We\nwanted to hire someone\nwho wanted to do this job\nand was able to do it. That\nmeans hiring someone\nfrom the student union\necosystem, which invariably means it is likely the\nperson you bring in will\nhave some NUS affiliation\nas most student unions are\nmembers.\nOften Imperial, as a\nCollege and as a Union,\nwill sometimes pretend\nit\u2019s on an island in the sky,\nnot tethered to anything\nelse. But being connected\nto other student unions,\nand knowing about some\nof the positive things they\nare doing \u2013 without being\ndragged into some of the\nless positive things \u2013 is\nnot without value.\nWe should be doing\nthat more. In the past\nwe\u2019ve been completely\nunplugged, from national\ntrends as well as other\nunions. But this year,\nwe\u2019ve been involved\nwith Wonkhe, which\nhas allowed us to better\nintegrate into that via\ntheir whatsapp group,\nwebinars, one-on-one\nchats with their head\nevery month, and so on.\nWe\u2019re infinity-percent\nmore plugged in than we\nwere before.\nFelix: Can you talk\nabout what Wonkhe\nis?\nAS: It\u2019s a sort of thinktank\nbased around higher\neducation policy. They\ndo studies and research\nfor both universities and\nstudent unions.The people\nwho founded and run it\nhave more of a student\nunion background, so they\nunderstand the issues we\nface and they care about\na good student experience\nat universities. They feed\nus information on higher\neducation policy and\nnews, catered to student\nunions, with features on\nnew developments or\nspeculative new trends, or\nnew legislation. They can\nalso be commissioned to\ndo specific pieces of work.\nFelix: And finally, for\nclarity, none of this\nrepresents a shift\nin the Union\u2019s perspective towards the\nNUS?\nAS: No.We were NUS-agnostic. In a different set of\ncircumstances, without\nthe controversies and lack\nof focus on the big issues,\nI might be advocating for\nus to be involved in things\nat the national level.\nThere\u2019s a limit to what\nany student union at any\nuniversity can achieve\nby itself; sometimes you\nhave to push for things\ntogether as part of a larger\ngroup. But I\u2019m not willing\nto pull students along into\nthat when, right now, it\nmight not benefit them,\nand I don\u2019t think there\nis an appetite amongst\nthe student body to get\ninvolved. As it is, we\u2019ve\nbeen starting to look at\nother ways of linking up\nwith other universities.\nFor example, we had a\nsabbatical officer meetup\nfor sabbs across London\nlast year.\nFelix: What are your\nthoughts on Simone\nBuitendijk\u2019s departure for Leeds?\nAS: We are really sad to\nsee her go. Even where\nwe haven\u2019t agreed with\nher 100%, it\u2019s clear that\nshe has good intentions\nand cares deeply about the\nstudent experience \u2013 and\nespecially the holistic\nstudent experience. She\u2019s\nreally committed to that\nvision, where the different\nthings affecting students,\neducational decisions and\nfinancial decisions, are\nbrought into true align-ment.\nWe are obviously nervous\nabout what happens next.\nWe hope we have a good\ndegree of involvement\nin the selection of her\nsuccessor \u2013 and that her\nsuccessor shares those\nviews and is as committed\nto seeing through some of\nthe positive work she has\nstarted on learning and\nteaching, and in collaboration with the student\nunion, academics across\ndifferent departments, the\nVice-Deans, and so on.\nFelix: The Union\nCouncil voted to support the UCU strikes\nat Union Council last\nweek (see News, Felix\nIssue 1744.) Josef\nWillsher, a student,\ncame and presented\na paper mandating\nthe Union and student representatives\nto actively lobby the\nCollege in support\nof the strikes. That\npassed with a massive 29-1 majority,\nwith one abstention.\nHow do you feel personally feel about the\nUCU strikes, and how\ndo you feel about\nthis approach that\nthe Council has mandated you to follow?\nAS: Firstly, Union\nCouncil voted overwhelmingly to support the\naction. Students are going\nto be disrupted by this\naction, yes. Council voted\nto support the strikes\nbecause the representatives felt that although\nstudents will be disadvantaged in the short-term, in\nthe long-term it is to the\nbenefit of both current and\nfuture students who want\nto become academics that\nthey are well compensat-ed, that their grievances\nare taken seriously, and\nthat they are engaged\nwith meaningfully when\nit comes to different negotiations nationally over\npensions or locally over\npay.\nAlso, blurring into my\npersonal view a bit, I\nthink students felt that\nthis is part of a general\ntrend. Over time, having\npension contributions\ngoing up a little bit, the\nbenefits getting a little\nworse, pay going up less\nthan inflation or not at\nall leading to an effective\npay cut. The changes that\nwere being presented to\npensions in 2018 were\nmuch more fundamental,\nwhich meant it was a\nmore clear-cut situation.\nMy personal view is that it\nis less clear-cut this time.\nIt would be more difficult\nto make the case for strike\naction over the individual\nminor change this year\nor last year, or the year\nbefore that, and so on. But\nthose incremental changes\nto how staff are valued\nand rewarded add up over\ntime. In the end, staff are\nworse off, and so students\nare worse off because you\ncan\u2019t attract good people.\nIf that sounds familiar,\nthat\u2019s because it is exactly\nwhat happens to students.\nThe food prices increase\njust a bit above inflation\nevery year \u2013 and the\nchange from when you\nstart and end your degree\nis huge. Or rent. It\u2019s\none or two things every\nyear \u2013 a facility being\nclosed, some price being\nincreased, and so on.\nThat one little thing might\nnot be enough to get\npeople to react, but if you\ndon\u2019t start saying \u201cno\u201d at\nsome point, if you don\u2019t\nwake up at step one or two\nand do something about\nit, then suddenly you\u2019re\nat step 15 and things are\nway worse than they once\nwere. That\u2019s the pattern\nI\u2019ve seen over a number\nof years. I don\u2019t think\nour predecessors effectively and constructively\nchallenged the university\n\u2013 which means that the\nexperience of someone at\nthis university ten years\nago had things a lot better,\nfinancially at least, than\nsomeone here now.\nThe student reps on Union\nCouncil \u2013 as they did in\n2018 \u2013 strongly empathise\nwith the UCU\u2019s position,\nbecause it is the same one\nwe are in as students. In\nspite of whatever misgivings we might have about\nthis particular dispute,\nand about the short-term\nnegative impact on\nstudents, it\u2019s the responsible thing to do. To encourage a resolution, and\nnot to take things at face\nvalue.\n\n"

    "content": "PUZZLES\nFRIDAY, 28TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\n10\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week Felix spoke to the Union President, Abhijay Sood, about too many topics to list!\nFelix: I wanted to\nstart by catching up\nwith you on rent.\nWhat\u2019s happening\nwith the Imperial Cut\nthe Rent campaign,\nand with the rent\nrenegotiations in\ngeneral?\nAS: The campaign is yet\nto have its first meeting,\nwhich will take place at\n6.15pm on Monday 2nd\nMarch, in SAF120 (in the\nSir Alexander Fleming\nbuilding.) Our intention\nis to set up a space where\nstudents can initially get\ninvolved, but from then\non it will be self-organised\nby motivated students. We\nwill discuss the actions\nthat were endorsed by\nUnion Council at the\nExtraordinary Meeting.\nWhatever we do next is\ndown to what those who\nattend want us to do.\nFelix: Will the people who will run the\ncampaign, an internal committee, be\nelected at this first\nmeeting?\nAS: That depends on the\nstructure that interested\nstudents want to have \u2013\nthere are different ways of\nrunning a campaign. You\ncan have a very traditional\nstructure, with an elected\nchair and committees and\nsuch, but many campaigns\neven at this university\ndon\u2019t run that way \u2013 for\nexample, Divest has no\ncentralised leadership. We\nwant to listen to students,\nnot impose a method.\nFelix: Why have it be\nmembers of the panel felt challenged, or\nthat their alignment\nis still the same as at\nthe start?\nAS: I think that people\nare capable of change,\nbut only so much. Fundamental differences in\nthe positions of different\nactors did not necessarily\nchange. Having said that,\nthere are some individual\nthings that I did not realise\nbefore. Some technical\nthings about how fund\nmanagers operate, which\nis interesting no matter\nwhat you think of the\nethical questions. Some of\nthe details of how different\nfirms and fund managers\nhave come to different\nconclusions, too. Some\nof the fund managers had\nalready divested from\nsome of the fossil fuel\ncompanies, for example,\neither because they did\nnot see them as viable\ninvestments, or because\nthey had tried to engage\nwith the companies about\nrenewable energy investment and had pulled out\nwhen those firms\u2019 actions\ndidn\u2019t match their words.\nThe financial sector is\nalready moving along this\ntrajectory; what happened\nto tobacco is starting to\nhappen to fossil fuels.\nFelix: The block grant\nnegotiations are also\nongoing \u2013 the bid\nfrom the Union to the\nCollege for funding.\nHow\u2019s that going?\nAS: It was delayed a little\nbecause of the Managing\nDirector stepping down,\nbut is now in progress.\nBecause of some of the\nissues the Union has faced\nthis year we\u2019re making a\none-year bid instead of the\ntypical three, alongside a\none-year strategy plan to\nbring different teams into\nalignment and to align the\nresources we have with\nthe needs students have\nin the short-term, which I\ndon\u2019t think we have been\nits money. While some of\nthe details of the decision\nare not necessarily exactly\nwhat I or most students\nwould want, they are a\nbig step closer to that than\nwhen we started. That will\nbe reflected in the content\nof the policy released on\nMonday. This is a real,\nconstructive, positive\nshift from where the\nCollege was to where we\nwould want it to be, and\nit leaves the door open to\nrevisiting this issue and\nstrengthening the policy in\ncoming years depending\non how firms we invest in\nrespond, and depending\non the external pressures\nchange. From that point of\nview I think it\u2019s been very\nproductive. It\u2019s been a\ntestament to what student\nrepresentatives can do,\ntogether, when they think\nabout the incentives that\nother people in the room\nhave, when they realise\nthe ability and power they\nhave \u2013 for example, us\nrealising we can bring this\nto College Council \u2013 and\nfollowing things through\nproductively by constructively challenging people\nrather than by starting\noff with being a bit of a\ndoormat and just accepting the status quo at face\nvalue.\nWhile I don\u2019t necessarily\nagree with the views of\neveryone we interacted\nwith on the panel, I think it\nwas largely very constructive and that the sessions\nwe had were informative\nand interesting. That\u2019s the\nsort of collaboration we\nneed going forward, with\nstudents and staff and\nsenior management are\nsitting on the same level\nand discussing issues on\ntheir merit.\nFelix: And what was\nyour experience\nthere like? Was your\nmind changed at\nany point, or were\nyou surprised by\nanything? Equally, do\nyou think that other\npurely student-led,\nrather than run by a\nSabbatical Officer?\nAS: We didn\u2019t think it\nwould be appropriate.\nWe want the Union to\nsupport and facilitate\naction other students\nmight want to take. We\u2019ve\nhad a productive role in\nthe negotiations thus far,\nbut it\u2019s not up to us to\ndictate what happens next\nwithout wider student\ninvolvement.\nFelix: The College has\nnow published the\nprices for 2020/21.\nThoughts?\nAS: We weren\u2019t happy\nwith the outcome of the\nnegotiations and how\ninformation was shared,\nand we\u2019ve talked about\nthat in Felix and on our\nblogs. But we did move\nthe College in the right\ndirection on this.\nEven though in the short\nterm it\u2019s going to be a\nchallenge to reopen this\nas a topic for debate, we\nhope that in the long-term\nwith the added pressure a\nstudent-led campaign can\ngive, that we will be able\nto reopen this issue and\ndiscuss it in the broader\ncontext of the College\u2019s\nover-arching decision\nmaking. We want to\nlimit areas where they\u2019re\nworking against themselves and doing wrong\nby students.\nFelix: A few Union\nCouncil members\nrepeatedly expressed\n(including in Felix)\nthat they felt uncomfortable with the way\ndiscussions about\nrent were conducted\nin Council by yourself\nand Shervin, saying\nthey felt pressured\ninto making decisions too quickly and\nwith too little infor-mation. What are\nyour thoughts?\nAS: I understand where\nthose criticisms are\ncoming from. However,\nany information we\nreceived that was not\nexplicitly confidential\nwas shared with the\nCouncil, and we shared\nit in the same timeframe\nin which we received the\ninformation ourselves. We\ntried to be as proactive\nas possible in involving\nthose members in the\nconversation.\nThetruthisthatsometimes\nin a negotiation, especially a really important one,\ndecisions have to be made\nin a time-compressed\nfashion. Sometimes\nyou get the information\nor the deal at the last\nminute, and you have to\ntake a decision on it. At\nthat point, the sabbatical\nofficers have a choice. I\ncould, as President, say\n\u2018this is the direction we\nare going in, here is what\nwe will do\u2019 \u2013 or I could\nsay \u2018here is what I think\nwe should do, but I will\nconsult with a wider array\nof representatives because\nI believe in our democratic processes.\u2019 That\u2019s the\nway we tried to approach\nthis. I\u2019ve had conversations with a lot of those\nwho expressed discomfort\nwith some of the timelines\naround this, about how\nsometimes you just have\nto be decisive. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you have to\nexclude representatives,\nand we worked our asses\noff to not exclude people\n\u2013 to be as inclusive and\ntransparent as possible.\nWe\u2019ve done lots of direct\ncommunication with\nstudents about the issue,\nwe brought every single\nsubstantive change the\nCollege offered on the\ndeal back to the Council,\nand every time we weren\u2019t\nsure whether we should\nor could share something\nwe erred on the side of\nsharing more. Particularly\nwhen we were asked\nquestions. I don\u2019t think\nthat under the circumstances we could have\nbeen more transparent,\nand I\u2019m sorry that people\nfelt uncomfortable with\nsome of the timescales\ninvolved, but I also don\u2019t\nthink it would have been\npossible to do anything\ndifferently. I don\u2019t have\nany regrets about how we\ndealt with that process\nwith regards to Union\nCouncil. And it\u2019s worth\nnoting that only a small\nminority of members felt\nthat way.\nFelix: You were also\na part of the Working Group set up on\nsocially responsible\ninvestment at the\nCollege, after you\nsubmitted the paper\nto College Council\nalongside the DPFS\nand Ethics and Environment Officer.\nThey\u2019ve now reported back to the Council (after consultation\nwith the Endowment\nBoard, who control\ninvestments), who\npassed the policy\nwith some minor\ncaveats and will be\nannouncing that on\nMarch 2nd along\nwith a report on the\nworking group\u2019s\nactivities. That policy would bind the\nEndowment Board\u2019s\ninvestment deci-sions. What was that\nprocess like, and how\ndo you feel about the\nresult?\nAS: Overall, we got out\nof this process what I\nexpected to get out of\nit. When I ran for this\nposition, part of my\nmanifesto was helping to\nbring an end to some of\nits unethical investments\nand getting the College to\nconsider the ethical implications of where it invests\nits money. We have done\nthat. For the first time,\nImperial has a policy that\nfactors in ethical concerns\nwhen the College invests\n\n"

Each year\u2019s\nBall is based around a\ndifferent theme \u2013 with this\nyear\u2019s being \u2018Enchanted\nForest\u2019.\nThisyear\u2019sBallfeatures\nseveral distinct changes\nfrom previous years. The\nheadline act will be live,\nrather than a DJ, with the\nannouncement of the act \u2013\nwho is promised to be an\nexciting name \u2013 coming\nnext week. Food and a\nprosecco reception are on\noffer as included in the\nticket price for the first\ntime, and the fireworks\ndisplay is coming back\nin full glory. This has\nresulted in an increase in\nticket prices, with Early\nBird tickets for both the\nBall and afterparty selling\nfor \u00a357.50.\nThe biggest change,\nhowever, is one behind-the-scenes. While most\nstudents simply attend\nand enjoy the festivities,\nmonths of planning from\ndozens of people goes into\nmaking the Ball a reality\nevery year. Previously, the\nevent was run as for-prof-it, headed by the Union\u2019s\nCommercial Services\ndirectorate \u2013 who also\noperate the bars, shops,\nand online merchandise\nthe Union sells.\nHowever, this year the\nBall is fully student-or-ganised. Every aspect,\nfrom the budgeting to the\nadministration to the act\nof setting it up is being\nrun by a student commit-tee, chaired by the Deputy\nPresident (Finance and\nServices), Fifi Henry, and\ncomprised of key student\nvolunteers who have\nworked on previous Balls.\nThese students broadly\nfit into four groups: the\nArts and Entertainments\nManagement Group, who\noversee a variety of soci-eties; the Beit Bars staff;\nthe DramSoc technical;\nand relevant sabbatical\nofficers, namely the DPFS\nand DPCS, Thomas Fernandez-Debets.\nAccording to these\nkey volunteers, each of\nwhom has been involved\nin Union-organised\nBalls in previous years,\nthis change represents a\nsignificant improvement\nin both the experience of\nrunning the Ball, and the\nend result for students.\nFelix spoke to four of\nthem, one from each of the\naforementioned groups, to\nget their perspectives.\nFifi Henry, the DPFS,\ndescribed how the change\nwas made \u2013 and reveals\nthat it initially came to be\nafter an attempt to cancel\nthe Summer Ball entirely.\n\u201cThere was a proposal\nput forward to the Leadership Team at the Union,\nsaying that the Ball should\nbe scrapped and scaled\nback to a Carnival event in\nBeit or moved externally\n\u2013 which would have significantly increased ticket\nprices and lost us any\ncontrol over the event. We\ndidn\u2019t want to scrap it, and\nI in particular felt it was\na really valuable event.\nThough there had been\nissues in the past, people\ndid still always come to\nthe Ball.\n\u201cA paper for cancelling\nthe Ball was submitted to\nthe Board of Trustees by\nthe Head of Commercial\nServices, and I argued\nthat I would instead\nrapid planning began. The\ncommittee was put together in quick time, with\na large task ahead of them\nand little time to do it in.\n\u201cI then had five weeks\nto create a budget \u2013 item-ising everything, breaking\nit down, and costing it\nall \u2013 to present at the next\nBoard meeting. I had to\nturn around and quickly\nget the committee set up,\nto start working on what\nwe wanted the Ball to look\nlike so we could submit\nthat. I didn\u2019t have much\nevent experience, but the\nBoard needed buy-in; to\nknow I had a handle on\nthis.\u201d\nReactions to the Ball\nhad often had a negative\ncast in prior years, with\nstudent feedback raising\ncomplaint that they did\nnot receive enough for\nthe cost of their ticket.\nDespite high attendance\nevery single year, the\nstudent committee felt\nthat this indicated a clear\nchange was needed.\nJoseph O\u2019Connell\n-Danes, the Arts and Entertainments Management\nGroup Chair, said: \u201cwe\nwere all in agreement that\nthe last couple of years it\nhas just felt like you paid\nto go to the same campus\nthat you were on day in,\nday out and didn\u2019t really\nget much for the money.\nAs such the focus has\nreally been on creating\nan experience from the\nmoment you set foot in\nthe venue and so we have\nput considerably more\nemphasis (and money) on\nthe set design for the ball.\nLydia has come back with\nsome incredible plans and\nall credit to her, if it looks\nlike the plan it will be jaw\ndropping.\u201d\nFifi corroborated: \u201cFor\nmost students who have\nbeen to Balls in the past,\ntheir feedback has never\nbeen listened to, and the\nsame thing has been put on\noffer every year without\nmuch development or\nprogress. People always\nfelt that they didn\u2019t get\nvalue-for-money out of\nSummer Ball committee members // Summer Ball Committee\nFelixspoketofourofthemembersoftheSummerBallstudentcommitteetofindouthowtheexperienceisdifferent\n\u201cA paper for\ncancelling\nthe Ball was\nsubmitted\nto the Board\nof Trustees,\nand I argued\nthat I'd take\nresponsibility\nfor it with a\nstudent-led\ncommittee\u201d\ntake responsibility for\nthe Summer Ball with a\nstudent-led committee to\norganise it.\u201d\nWith the Summer Ball\nsaved from cancellation,\n\n"

    "content": "Upstart Crow, Outstanding Codpiece\nU\npstart Crow\nis the theatre\na d a p t a t i o n\nof the eponymous BBC television\nprogramme. It follows\nthe fictionalised life of\nWilliam Shakespeare,\nthe famous playwright\nwho was once mocked as\nas an \u201cupstart crow\u201d by\nhis contemporary critic\nRobert Greene. The play\ntakes up where series 3\nof the television show left\noff, telling the story of\nhow Shakespeare wrote\nOthello with the help of\nhis faithful household. In\ntrue panto style, the plot\nis driven by the threat of\nthe ever-present intervention by the Puritan\n\u201cPuretitties\u201d and the loss\nof royal favour, with the\nshow also featuring a\ndancing bear, two African\nroyals and a set of magnificent codpieces.\nThe stage adaptation\nstays true to its original\nroots, drawing on Shakespeare\u2019s own work from\nRomeo and Juliet to\nOthello. It is just as bawdy\nas the original - audiences are warned to expect\nsome real groaners. Given\nthe speed with which\neach quip is delivered, it\nsometimes felt as though\nthe punch lines didn\u2019t\nhave quite enough time to\nsettle. However, a more\nthan generous audience,\nmyself included, enjoyed\nthem immensely.\nDavid Mitchell reprised\nhis role from the TV series\nas the bard, holding the\nfort down with a solid\nperformance as a man\nthat borrows more than he\ncreates, particularly from\nhis well-versed daughters.\nWhile I appreciated some\nof the updates that the\nshow received for the\nWest End, particularly\nthe woke African royals\nwho delivered historically\naccurate monologues, I\ndo believe that some were\ncompletely unnecessary.\nThey say, never meet your\nheroes: I prefer to never\nhave witnessed David\nMitchell performing\nFortnite dances. Never\nhave I so rapidly lost all\nrespect for an individual\nas I did when I watched\nhim uncomfortably dance\n\u201cthe Shoot.\u201d Mark Heap\nalso featured prominently\nas \u201cPuretitty.\u201d Although I\nmostly recognise him as\nJim the neighbour from\nFriday Night Dinner, he\nwas clearly born to play\na self-flagellating Puritan.\nHe managed to capture\nthe panto-villain vibe very\nwell - and I have never\nbefore seen a man so well\nsuited to a codpiece.\nFor anyone expecting\nintelligent, thought-pro-voking humour, then this\nis probably not the place\nto find it. However, if\nyou\u2019re looking for somewhere where you can\nspend a couple of hours\nin unthinking amusement,\nthen this is the play for\nyou.\nDrawing Cities: Art by Stephen Wiltshire\nM\nost of us may\nhave heard\nthe story\nabout an\nartist, flying in a helicopter\nabove gigantic cities such\nas New York or Shanghai,\nwho then draws the entire\nlandscape he has seen\nwith ridiculous detail on\npaper once back on solid\nground. What most of us\ndon\u2019t know is the name\nof this artist and that he is\nliving in London.\nStephen Wiltshire is\nthis draftsman\u2019s name\nand his art is astonishing.\nFocusing on drawing\nentire cities, impressive\nbuildings down to the\nfancy cars and London\nbuses, his drawings are\nsnapshots from memory,\nwhat he sees in his mind\u2019s\neye.\nBorn in 1974 in\nLondon, Wiltshire spent\nhis childhood in Little\nVenice. From very early\nin his life he expressed\nan interest in sketching\nanimals and cars. This\nallowed him to communicate with his surroundings\nthrough his drawings,\nsomething he struggled\nto do verbally due to\nhis diagnosis of autism.\nWhen he was seven years\nold, he became interested\nin drawing landmark\nbuildings of London after\nbeing shown a book with\npictures of devastation\ncaused by earthquakes.\nWiltshire studied Arts\nat the City and Guild of\nLondon Arts School, from\nwhich he graduated in\n1998. Carrying on with\nhis passion, he had great\nsuccess with his true-to-scale, out-of-memory\ndrawings.

    "content": "NEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFelix: Why have you\ndecided to take the\njob and move to\nLeeds, rather than\nstay at Imperial?\nSB: I got a call from a\nheadhunter \u2013 that\u2019s often\nhow it goes, and it\u2019s how\nI ended up at Imperial. It\u2019s\nnot like I was looking at\nthe time. And then, why\nsay yes? It\u2019s probably\nbecause I\u2019m at that stage\nin my career where I think\nI would really like to\nlead a university, to be in\ncharge and be able to do\nthe things that I think are\nreally important . I can\nensure I\u2019m maximally able\nto influence the culture\nand the way people work\ntogether. This is a great\nopportunity; Leeds is a\nRussell Group university.\nI\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m\ngetting to that stage in my\nlife where if I don\u2019t take\nthat jump now, I won\u2019t\nhave enough good years\nin my life to do it with full\nenergy and conviction.\nYou don\u2019t do these kinds\nof jobs for just 2-3 years,\nyou need to do them for\nlonger. So the timing\nwas right, the university\nis great, and it\u2019s also an\nadventure to move out of\nLondon \u2013 I really enjoyed\nLondon, but it\u2019s also nice\nto get to know a whole\nother part of the country.\nA bit of serendipity!\nFelix: So it was about\nwanting to expand\nthe remit over which\nyou have input. Here\nat Imperial, you\u2019re VP\n(Education), so you\nhave oversight of the\nLearning and Teaching Strategy, and\nthings like the curriculum review. Is there\na particular other\narea you wanted\ninput into, that you\ndon\u2019t have in your\nrole currently?\nSB: As Vice-Chancellor , you are in charge of\neverything, so you can\nalso influence research,\noutreach, and societal\nimpact \u2013 as well as the\ncombination of those\nthings, which is particularly appealing. I think for\nuniversities to be success-ful, there need to be strong\ncommunities, and I have\nideas of how to do that. I\nalso want all universities\nto be globally relevant,\nand not just focused on\nthemselves. I\u2019ve always\nbeen keen to think of education not as something\nin an individual silo, separate from research and\nsocietal impact.\nI want to think about\neducation as research-led,\nand not just from the perspective of having great\nresearch being brought\ninto education, but also\nthinking about how we\u2019re\ntraining students to be the\nnext generation of global\ncitizens. Why don\u2019t we\nlisten to them really care-fully, and decide based on\nwhat they want in their\neducation how we frame\nour research? I think that\u2019s\nwhat modern research-in-tensive universities should\nbe doing much more. It\u2019s\nnot just going from the\n\u2018top down\u2019 and making\nsure students are exposed\nto great teachers, but\nrather using students as\ntrue partners and making\nthem influence what\nresearch and research-led\nteaching look like.\nFelix: Do you feel\nlike that vision was\nsomething that could\nnot or was not happening at Imperial?\nDo you think that\nin-silo thinking is\nsomething that Imperial was not able or\nwilling to do?\nSB:Itishappeninghere,\nbut I am only responsible\nfor education at Imperial.\nIt\u2019s hard to look at my job\nthat broadly \u2013 that\u2019s not\nmy job description right\nnow. Now, I obviously\nwant to do a great job in\neducation, and I work very\nwell with the Provost,\nICU, Vice-Deans, Deans,\nand Council and so on,\nwho share these ideas. But\nto actually be at the top of\nthe university, and bringing everybody together\naround these kinds of\nthemes \u2013 that\u2019s an exciting\nthing to do.\nFelix: What did the\nrest of the recruitment process look\nlike after you were\ncontacted by the\nheadhunter?\nSB: It\u2019s interesting \u2013\nit\u2019s an iterative process.\nFirst you speak to the\nheadhunter, who is briefed\non what the university\nis looking for and can\nanswer your queries. So I\nquickly became aware of\nthe fact that Leeds wants\nto move into this area of\nmore community-build-ing. They\u2019ve been very\nfocused on research in\nthe last seven years, and\nthey\u2019ve really become\nmuch more visible,\nparticularly around\nsustainably development\ngoals. They were always\nvery well-known for\ntheir education, but right\nnow they feel like they\nneed to create a bit more\nbalance to make sure that\nthe innovative education\nremains as visible as their\npresent amazing research\nis.\nSo they were looking\nfor someone who had\nideas about how to create\nan even stronger community of staff and students,\nwhich was very appeal-ing. I then met with the\nChair of their university\nCouncil, who was very\nproud of the university,\nand then informally met\nwith some people in\nLeeds to just get a sense\nof the city and make sure I\nlike the feel of the campus\nand the city itself! What I\nreally enjoyed talking to\neverybody there, including students, is that they\nwere all very proud and\nfelt like part of a commu-nity. Every single person\nI spoke to had their own\nview of the university,\nbut it all fit together and\ncreated a very nice picture\nof a place that\u2019s happening and ready for another\nphase. The present VC\nwas very positive about\ntheir team and the university too, which is always a\ngreat sign.\nIt\u2019s in a good place \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot like I have to pick it up\nfrom way below and build\nit up first, so we can really\nhit the ground running\ntogether.\nFelix: Imperial has\nperhaps struggled\nto develop a sense of\ncohesive community\nbetween different\nstakeholders. Why do\nyou think that exists\nat Leeds and not so\nmuch at Imperial?\nSB:I\u2019mnotsureItotally\nagree that\u2019s the case.\nIt\u2019s definitely changing.\nI understand where the\nquestion comes from and\nSB: I think it\u2019s very\nhard for them not to, as\nwe\u2019re so far underway\nand it\u2019s so clear it needed\nto happen. There are so\nmany people behind it\nand so much excitement\naround the things we\nare doing \u2013 and we\u2019re\nsuccessful in areas where\nwe do work together\noptimally. It\u2019s not just one\nbit of College that\u2019s doing\nthings. So I find it very\nhard to imagine that it\nwill stop or slow down, as\nthere are so many people\nwho are part of my team\nwith those ideas.\nIt\u2019s never just one\nperson \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have\ndone this on my own.\nI don\u2019t want to sound\noverly modest, but it\u2019s not\nme, it\u2019s really everybody\nelse. All I\u2019ve done is open\ndoors and enable people\nwho wanted to do this,\nsupporting and helping\nthem. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\ngoing to stop, and I don\u2019t\nthink students would\naccept it if all of a sudden\nif it did.\nFelix: The Union\u2019s\nblock grant fund-ing, which actually\ncomes under your\nfunding umbrella,\nwill be renegotiated\nthis year \u2013 but it will\nbe negotiated again\nnext year too, which\nis unusual. Are you\nat all concerned that\nfunding for students\nvia the Union will\nchange once you\u2019re\nno longer the one\nallocating that?\nSB: No, not at all. I\nthink the student reps are\namazing, both those there\nnow and the ones I\u2019ve\nworked with in past\nCont. on page 6\nFelix Interviews Simone Buitendijk, VP (Education)\nISSUE 1745\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFelix spoke to Simone Buitendijk, Imperial\u2019s Vice Provost (Education), about her decision to take a new role as\nVice-Chancellor at the University of Leeds\n3\nthat you\u2019re right to quite\na degree, but it\u2019s changing \u2013 especially since we\nare much more focused\nnow on the student experience and thinking about\neducation across all of\nImperial. We\u2019re moving\naway from looking at faculties and departments as\ncompletely separate units.\nAnd we need to, because\nthe Office for Students\nare asking things from the\nentire university, so even\nif we hadn\u2019t figured that\nout ourselves we would\nbe slowly moving in that\ndirection.\nI\u2019m very optimistic\nabout how Imperial will\ncontinue doing. I understand what you are saying\nbecause I don\u2019t think we\nare there yet, but we are\nmoving, and that\u2019s what\nstudents are telling us too.\nStudents are very clear\nthat they want that sense\nof community, that they\nsee themselves and their\ncolleagues as part of an\nImperial student body, not\nonly part of a\ndepartment \u2013 although\ndepartmental identity is\nvery important too. To be\nsuccessful as a university,\nyou need to create that\nsense of the academic\ncommunity as a whole.\nFelix: I would argue\nyou\u2019ve been a driver of some of that\nchange over the past\nfew years, based\non the vision that\nyou have. Are you\nconcerned that this\nchange, and your\nprojects such as the\nLearning and Teaching Strategy being\nhalfway through,\nhow do you ensure\nyour successor continues on the right\npath?\n\n"

    "content": "Arturo UI: How to Become a Vegetable Dictator\nI\nmperial\u2019s very own\nDrama Society put\ntogether, in less than\n5 weeks, an epic\nplay that combines strong\nallegorical imagery with\nsubtle satire and a pinch\nof cauliflower. The magic\nhappened thanks to the\neffort of 15 cast members\ntogether with a 12-strong\ntechnical team.\nThe plot follows the\nstory of Arturo Ui, a\ngangster who gradually\ntakes control of Chicago\u2019s\nvegetable industry using\na mixture of corruption,\nmanipulation and assas-sination. Every step of\nhis journey mirrors that\nof Adolf Hitler, from the\neconomic crash to the\nscapegoating of Jews\nand foreigners, to his\n\u201cdemocratic\u201d election\nand reign of tyranny. The\nmost important historical\nmoments of his rise are\nfaithfully portrayed. The\nplay manages to walk\na very narrow line all\nthe way through - the\naudience laughs at the\njokes while hurting at\ntheir horrible allegorical\nimplications.\nAlfred Engedal, who\nportrays the title charac-ter, is the absolute star of\nthe show. His passionate\nmonologues, alternating\nquickly between viperine\ncharm and spitting rage,\nmade such a faithful\nimpression of his Nazi\nalter ego that I often\nfound myself physically\nrepulsed. Other performances worth noting were\nthose of Dorien Lijnzaad,\na calculating assassin,\nKacper Neumann, who\nsomehow managed to\nwear a tower of hats\nalmost a third of his\nWhen It Breaks It Burns\nI\nn 2015, reacting to\nimmense cuts in\ngovernment funding\nfor education, many\nstudents occupied high\nschools across the country\nin large-scale protests..\nDuring this performance,\n15 of these students\nshowed how they lived\nthrough such an intense\nexperience and the change\nit caused in their lives.\nThe first part of the show\nwas a reproduction of how\nthe occupation took place\nwhile during the second\npart they showed us how\nthey bonded between then\nand how the experience\nchanged them.\nInstead of an auditori-um, the audience sat on\na group of chairs in the\nmiddle of a large room.\nThe dancers were right\namong us, sitting on\nthe chairs, running and\ndancing around us, talking\nand screaming on top of\neach other. Although it\nwas hard to understand\neverything that was said\nduring this first part, the\nchaos created in the room\nmanaged to convey the\nemotions they felt. The\ninteractivity of the performance intensified the\nenergy in the room, eliciting anxiety and thrills in\nthe viewers that made it\nseem as if we were taking\npart in the school occupations ourselves.\nIn the second part, the\nchairs were put aside,\nleaving a wide space for\nperformers and audience\nmembers to dance\ntogether and creating a\nstrong collective feeling\nbetween the participants.\nThis sense of unity was\nenhanced by colourful\nwords embroidered on a\nmassive banner: solidari-ty, strength, support... In\ncontrast to these empow-ering, strident moments,\nthe show was full of\nkindness and warmth.\nThe most compelling\npart came when the\naudience was divided into\nsmall groups, with three\nperformers in each group.\nThese performers spoke\nabout their personal experiences and reflected on\nhow this episode in their\nlives had changed them\nfor the better. Contrasting\ntheir current selves with\npictures of them from\nbefore to the occupation,\nthey showed how the\nprotests had made them\nstronger and braver, and\nmore able to be their true\nselves, both externally\nand internally. A common\nchange in all of them\nwas their hair. They had\nall dyed theirs in bright\ncolours, representing their\nnewfound bond, and also\ntheir newfound courage\nin going out with their\nnatural afro hair.\nWhile the originality\nand interactivity of the\nshow managed to create\na strong connection\nbetween everyone in the\nroom, it was also difficult to follow the events\nentirely. Even though the\nfreedom and authentic\ndepiction of the performance set it apart from\nother plays, a slightly less\nchaotic structure would\nhave improved the audience\u2019s understanding.\nThe show ended on the\nstreet, with the audience\nand performers united,\nshouting and protesting\nlike they had done years\nbefore. Together, we\nremembered the essential points of that night\nsuch as loving ourselves\nand being brave. This\nunexpected ending left\nus hyped and emotional.\nUnquestionably, a great\nperformance for recalling\nthe importance of fighting\nfor what we want, and\na novel experience of\ntheatre from a completely\ndifferent perspective.\nISSUE 1745\nFELIX\n13\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "ISSUE 1745\nFELIX\n39\nRCSU\nPeter Hull\nVice-President (Welfare)\nL\nast week the\nWellbeing Team\nof the RCSU,\nled by me and\nMareya Saba (Wellbeing\nActivities Coordinator),\nran a week-long campaign\nin support of focusing\non yourself and your\nwellbeing: RCS You. The\ncampaign\u2019s five themes\naimed to bring a different\nemphasis to each day:\nCommunity, Mindfulness,\nArt, Environment, and\nAnimals. We took part\nin relaxing activities, got\ntogether as a community\nof scientists, and emphasised healthy attitudes\nsurrounding mental\nwellbeing.\nThe week was a huge\nsuccess, with the finale\nconsisting in the Dog\nTherapy session on Friday\nproving to be in extremely\nhigh demand with all 160\nslots getting filled within 2\nhours. After hearing year\nrepresentatives\u2019 feedback\nabout wanting a dog\npetting session in every\nstudent-staff committee\n(SSC) meeting for the past\ntwo years, the bureaucratic nightmare we had to go\nthrough to organise it was\nhonestly worth it.\nThe dogs put smiles\non a lot of students faces,\nbut what problems did\nthe campaign address or\neven try to solve? Last\nmonth, in a College-organised working group\non Embedding Wellbeing\ninto the Curriculum, the\nstate of mental wellbeing\nof Imperial students was\ndescribed as \u201cfragile\u201d.\nThe reasons given for\nthis included that students\ncome to Imperial having\nbased their identity around\ntheir intelligence just to\nhave that ripped out under\nthem, and for many the\nacademic pressure can be\ntoo much to handle. Furthermore, the changing\ndemographic of more\nsocio-economically disadvantaged students participating in university means\nthat there are a higher\nproportion of students\nnegatively impacted by\nfinancial stress, which\nhas been linked to poor\nstudent mental health.\nA study ran by the Education Policy Institute in\n2018 clearly showed that\nmental health issues are\nbecoming more prevalent\nin the university-student\npopulation; the proportion\nof 16- to 24-year-olds\nexperiencing a common\nmental disorder increased\nby 25% between 1993\nand 2014, the demand in\ncounselling services at\nuniversities increased by\nover 25% between 2006\nand 2015, and the student\nsuicide rate increased by\n52% between 2000 and\n2016.\nThese issues are the\nobvious motivation\nbehind running a facul-ty-wide Welfare Week\nsuch as RCS You, but it\u2019s\nclear that these events\nare not nearly enough.\nFirstly, sessions such\nas Pet Therapy are only\npsychologically effective\nwith regular interaction,\ninstead of as a one-off\nsession. Secondly,\nstudents in a particularly\nbad place are far less\nlikely to put themselves\nout there and get involved\nin the kinds of activities\nthat we offered. Finally,\nthe campaign does\nnothing for addressing\nthe structural issues such\nas drained counselling\nservices, unsupportive\npersonal tutors, and\nsystematic academic\npressure.\nHowever, as student\nvolunteers, our goal\nshould be to pressure\nthe faculty on all sides\nto take responsibility for\nstudent welfare. Running\nlight-hearted campaigns\nwith relaxing activities\nsuch as yoga and colouring comes under this, as\nit brings mindfulness and\nthe concept of wellbeing\nto the forefront of the\nconversation; simply providing a short-term escape\nfrom studies is worth\nit, even if the positive\noutcomes for wellbeing\nare also short-term. But\nit isn\u2019t enough, and it\ncan\u2019t just be down to us\nas volunteers. During the\nremainder of the year we\nwill work tirelessly to represent those who couldn\u2019t\nparticipate and those who\naren\u2019t aware of the issues\naffecting them. Whether\nthat\u2019s us as representatives\nsupporting new initiatives\nsuch as Embedding Wellbeing into the Curriculum,\nbuilding new roles that\naddress socio-econom-ic issues such as the\nWorking-Class Officer,\nor simply being at every\nSSC telling staff just how\nineffective personal tutors\nare at signposting or safeguarding students in need.\nThere\u2019s so much more that\nwe can do, and should do,\nfor student welfare.\nWe should take responsibility for our collective\nwellbeing. Despite developing a healthy mindset\nregarding wellbeing being\na personal and individual\njourney, it is still our duty\nto support each other as\nstudents, staff and repre-sentatives.\nWhose responsibility is our wellbeing?\nCONSTITUENT UNION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTherapy Dogs Nationwide, dog petting session, pet therapy // RCSU\n\n"

How\ndo I even start\nd e s c r i b i n g\nD r e a m s ?\nDreams is something truly\nunique and ever growing.\nIt is a video game creation\ntool, but also a hub of\nendless games that one\ncan try themselves. It has\na campaign if you want\nto get stuck into gameplay \u2013 but equally you\ncan watch music videos,\nor the start of movies\nrecreated by fans at the\nclick of a button. Dreams\nis the ultimate creative\noutlet for gamers, whether\nwell versed in the realm of\ncreation or not.\nWhen you first open up\nthe game, you a greeted\nby a narrator who guides\nyou through some basic\nmechanics of the game \u2013\nincluding the use of Impy\nthe imp (effectively the\ncursor for the player to\ncontrol when playing or\ncreating games). After\nthis relatively short introduction to the world of\nDreams (optional) motion\ncontrols, you are given\nthe choice: Play or Create.\nThis is the crux of what\nDreams is about: you can\ncreate games for others\naround the world, play\ngames made by others, or\na little bit of both.\nWhile released on\nFriday 14th of February,\nDreams has been in early\naccess for quite some time,\nwith plenty of passionate,\nbudding game developers\ngetting their teeth into\neverything the game has\nto offer. This was a great\nidea for Dreams developer\nMedia Molecule to have,\nas it meant that when\neveryone jumped into the\ngame 2 weeks ago, there\nwas already a vast array\nof content to enjoy.\nI began by choosing\nto play, so that I could\nget some inspiration.\nIt is recommended that\nyou play a movie length\ncampaign created by\nMedia Molecule called\n\u2018Art\u2019s Dream\u2019. Art\u2019s\nDream is created within\ndreams and highlights the\nplethora of things that can\nbe done within the game.\nShifting between 3 main\nperspectives, I got to experience a point and click\nadventure, a multiplayer\nbeat \u2018em up and a puzzle\nplatformer. Interlaced\nwith the occasional music\n\u201cwhen\nsurfing the\ndreamverse, it\nis hard to know\njust where to\nstart\u201d\n\u201csomeone had\ntaken the time\nto recreate the\nfirst 7 minutes\nor so of Star\nWars Episode\nIV: A New\nHope\u201d\nvideo and cinematic\ncutscene, this 3-hour\ncampaign felt vibrant,\nartistic and extremely\nvaried. Throughout the\ncampaign, I picked up\nvarious bubbles containing objects which can be\nused to create my own\ngame \u2013 something that I\nwill cover later.\nWhen surfing the\ndreamverse, it is hard to\nknow just where to start.\nThere are so many options\nto choose from \u2013 but\nluckily there is a great\nfilter system that can filter\nby genre, accolade or tags\n(e.g. single player, music,\ne.t.c.). There is also an\noption to shuffle games\nand play random ones in\nsuccession for as long as\nyou like. As there is an\never-increasing number\nof games that vary so\nwidely in scope, I could\nnever hope to cover them\nall in this article (or any\nfor that matter). Instead,\nI will highlight some of\nmy favourites. First was a\ngame created as part of a\nwild-west themed creation\nevent, where dreamers had\na limited time to create a\ngame based on the wild\nwest. This game had a\nrelatively simple premise.\nYou sit at a piano trying\nto press certain buttons in\ntime with the music. This\nbecame more difficult as\ntime went on, and if you\nmessed up you would\nbe targeted by a bandit.\nYou have to dodge left\nor right to avoid gun fire,\nall-the-while remaining\nin time with the music.\nThis beautifully simply\ngameplay mixed with\nthe nail-biting anxiety of\nbeing shot made for over\nan hour of fun.\nOn the complete other\nend of the spectrum, I then\nstumbled across someone\nwho had effectively recreated parts of Fallout 4. He\nsaid it took him 9 months\nto design the textures,\nPipBoy HUD, shooting,\nanimations and opening\nsequence (as well as a\nquest chain and various\nenemies). I was blown\naway by how closely it\nresembled Fallout 4, and\nwith promise of future\nupdates I promptly added\nit to my follow list. One\ngreat aspect of Dreams is\nthe ability to follow both\ncreators and their specific\ncreations, so that you can\nsee whether a game is\nbeing updated, or whether\nthe creator has moved\nonto creating something\nnew entirely.\nNext, I stumbled\nacross one creation that\ntruly showed just how\nvaried Dreams could be.\nSomeone had taken the\ntime to recreate the first 7\nminutes or so of Star Wars\nEpisode IV: A New Hope;\nthe level of accuracy was\nastonishing. It blows\nmy mind how a random\nperson has the ability to\ndevelop a movie within\nthe confines of the creation\ntools of a video game \u2013 it\nreally puts Mario Maker\nto shame huh.\nThe creation mode of\nDreams is what makes\nit so unique. The possibilities really are endless\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t actually know\nwhere to start. Despite\nthe seemingly daunting\ntask, Media Molecule\nhave developed a system\nthat makes getting into\ncreation very straight-forward; it may seem\nclich\u00e9 but truly anyone\ncan create something in\nDreams. I started by using\nbackgrounds and objects\nthat were premade in the\ngame \u2013 rocks, bushes,\nwater\u2026 although you can\nmake your own creations\nif you so choose. I slowly\nstarted building up a 3D\nplatformer where you rise\nup in a spiral, fighting\nenemies as you go. I then\ndecided to add some more\nchallenging platforming.\nDreams has an amazing\ntool which allows you to\nmove an object in real\ntime, then put it on a loop\nto create a crude form of\nanimation, rather than\nhaving to control something frame by frame.\nWith all of this done,\nand a button at the end to\ncomplete the level, I had\ncreated my first game \u2013 in\nunder 30 minutes!\nI have spent almost\n2 weeks in dreams and\nstill feel as though I\nhave barely scratched the\nsurface, but as I play more\nand create more a slowly\nfeel myself become more\nand more engrossed into\nthe ever growing landscape of Dreams \u2013 whilst\nsimultaneously having an\nimmense appreciation for\neveryone involved in the\ngrowth of my favourite\nmedium: video games.\nThe logo explains just as much as I could do accurately in one page... not much! // Playstation Lifestyle\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nStudio: Media Molecule.\nGenre: Game Creation.\nPlatforms: PS4\nDreams\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1745\nFELIX\nTECH technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nBuilding Your Own Computer, Part 1\nJoin the Editor-in-Chief in a weekly mini-series through his first build and what pitfalls to look out for ...\nTECH\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nB\nuilding my\nown PC has\nbeen in the\nback of my\nmind for a while now,\nbut it was always\nrather daunting. I think\na few people reading\nthis \u2013 being far more\ntech-savvy than myself,\nI am sure \u2013 might find\nthat a little amusing,\nbut I also think a lot of\npeople feel the same\nway. It\u2019s a relatively\ncomplex thing, filled\nwith reams of jargon,\ncompatibility issues, and\nof course the perceived\nrisk of making a mistake\nand frying your new\nexpensive hardware.\nI think that penultimate word \u2013 \u2018expensive\u2019\n\u2013 is part of what scares\npeople away, rather than\nthe complexity. It\u2019s the\nsame reason I\u2019ve never\nreally learned to cook\na steak properly. It\u2019s\nnot that it\u2019s enormously\ncomplicated, but that the\nfinancial cost of failure\nis high if I burn it to hell.\nI\u2019d rather take the risk\nof ruining something\ncheap, and learning to\ncook that.\nHowever, as I\u2019m\nlearning, if you\u2019re\ncareful and systematic\nabout the way you\napproach your build, it\u2019s\nnot that bad \u2013 and you\ncan save yourself more\nthan a couple of quid if\nyou buy parts yourself,\nrather than getting\nsomething customised\nonline or, God forbid,\nbuying a premade.\nNow there are a\ncouple of caveats here.\nYou won\u2019t have technical support should\nsomething go wrong,\nfor example, and your\nwarranty coverage is\nsomewhat more limited,\nas it will only address\nfailures of individual\ncomponents. For uni\ncomponents, from ebay\nto Facebook marketplace to Gumtree. While\nyou can find some\ngreat deals, there is an\nobvious risk: you have\nno guarantee the items\nwill work, or whether\nthey are on their last\nlegs.\nFor this reason,\nthere are a few parts\nto only ever buy new,\nand they\u2019re those that\n(should they get a bit\nwobbly) are more likely\nto damage your system\nas a whole. Namely, the\npower supply and moth-erboard. I\u2019d also advise\ngetting your data storage\nnew, especially if it is a\nmechanical harddrive,\nas often a good deal\non used drives implies\nthey\u2019ve been thrashed\npretty hard in some\nserver setup. Lastly, if\nyou\u2019re going to buy used\nparts, make sure you\nhave an opportunity to\ntest them \u2013 ask the seller\nif they can set it up for\nyou so you can run some\nbenchmarks. Failing\nthat, go to ebay, where\nthey have a 30-day mon-ey-back guarantee on\nitems that don\u2019t match\ntheir description.\nNow there\u2019s a good\nword \u2013 \u2018benchmarks\u2019.\nBest explain that, too.\nBenchmarking is\nthe practice of using\nsoftware suites to\ntest the performance\nof your system, or of\nindividual components.\nThey\u2019re often the best\nway, realistically, to\ntell what components\nare \u2018good\u2019 in terms of\nperformance and which\nare not. Online databases of benchmarks can\nbe used to compare and\ncontrast components\nand systems.\nWhich benchmarks\nyou use will depend\non both what you want\nto test, and what your\nsystem is designed for.\nSome popular examples\nfor gaming benchmarks\ninclude the 3DMark\nsuite, which conducts\ntest on the graphical performance and physics\ncalculations of your\ncomputer, or Cinebench,\nwhich is a CPU-oriented\ntest that examines how\nquickly your computer\ncan render a hyper-re-alistic image. Another\nis Prime95, which is\ndesigned essentially\nto test the stability of\nyour system and the\neffectiveness of your\ncooling by performing\na \u2018torture test\u2019 on your\nCPU \u2013 in other words,\nputting it under full load\nand seeing how high it\ncan crank up your tem-peratures.\nT e m p e r a t u r e s ,\nvoltages, and so on of\nyour components can\nbe monitored using\nfree software like\nHWiNFO64. If it\u2019s not\nclear \u2013 high temperatures are bad, as they\ncan damage components\nor, failing that, cause\nyour system to throttle\nthe performance of your\ncomponents so as to\navoid damage.\nAnother type of\nbenchmark are \u2018real-life\u2019 ones. For gaming\nespecially, there is an\nabundance of YouTube\nvideos and online\narticles that directly test\nthe frames-per-second\nin various games of different components and\nsystems.\nLastly, I want to\ndiscuss budget vs.\nperformance. This is\nalways hard to weigh-up\n\u2013 is adding \u00a320 to\nyour budget to get that\nslightly better processor\nworth it?\nThe best way to look at\nit, I think, is in terms of:\n\u25cf What you need from\nyour system. Build to the\nminimum that you need,\nor rather the minimum\nyou are likely to need in\nthe next couple of years.\nDon\u2019t spend on performance you won\u2019t actually\nutilise \u2013 if you\u2019re a gamer\nbut all you play is graph-ically-unintensive titles\nlike League of Legends,\ndon\u2019t buy a \u00a3500 graphics\ncard. Equally, don\u2019t skimp\nout on spending an extra\n\u00a350 if it means your\ncomputer actually does\nwhat you need it to \u2013 or,\nalternately, if it would\nmean saving \u00a3300 on an\nupgrade a year later. This\nhardware and software but\nhas no longevity, is smart\nand saves you a lot in the\nlong run.\n\u25cf How much you\nhave to spend, and how\nflexible you are in that.\nIf you have a hard limit,\nyou might have to make\nhard choices, and focus\non optimisation of price\nvs. performance. You can\neven phrase it as a ratio\n\u2013 take a benchmark that\nreflects your usage, for\nexample the frames-per-second in your favourite\ngame, and divide that by\nthe price of a component\nto get maximal efficiency\nabove some minimum\nperformance threshold\n(e.g. 40 frames per second\nin most single-player\ngames, 60 for competitive\nones.)\n\u25cf Spend on components that last. Look for\ngood warranties on items\nyou\u2019re buying new. A\ngood power supply, for\nexample, can last you the\nbetter part of a decade,\nand can be switched\nbetween systems when\nupgrading very easily. The\nTX650M I just bought has\na seven-year warranty. By\ncontrast, other compo-nents, such as processors\nor graphics cards, are ridiculously outdated seven\nyears down the line \u2013 for\nreference, a graphics card\nfrom seven years ago can\njust about run modern-ish\ngames at 15-20fps on\nlowest settings at 720p,\nand that\u2019s it.\nI\u2019ll be back next week\nto start breaking down\nwhat individual components you\u2019ll need, and\nhow to best assess the\nperformance and compatibility of each one!\n\u201cIf you\u2019re\ncareful and\nsystematic\nabout the way\nyou approach\nyour build, it\u2019s\nnot that bad\u201d\nwork, the fear of having\na catastrophic meltdown\nright before a deadline\nis enough for most of\nus to want that reliable\nsupport.\nBut, if you\u2019re looking\nto build a gaming or\nediting rig for your\nown hobbies, this might\nbe the way to go. One\nnoticeable benefit\nfor a hobbyist is that\nyou can swap out or\nupgrade parts freely\nwithout worrying about\nvoiding the warranty for\nanything else in your\nsystem, which is usually\nnot the case if you buy a\nprebuilt.\nBefore I dive into the\ncomponents breakdown\nnext week, there\u2019s a few\nmore things to discuss.\nFirstly, the dilemma\nof buying used vs. new\nparts. There is a thriving\nonline market for\nsecond-hand computer\n\u201cThere\u2019s an\nobvious risk:\nyou have no\nguarantee\nthe items\nwill work, or\nwhether they\nare on their\nlast legs.\u201d\noften ties into compatibility \u2013 buying a slightly\nnewer component that is\nlikely to be compatible\nwith next year\u2019s releases,\nrather than an old one\nthat can deal with today\u2019s\nInterested in writing and / or editing for the TECH section?\nPlease drop us an e-mail at technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 28TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\nAmerican Factory (2019)\nI\ncan\u2019t remember\nexactly when I\nfirst heard about\nAmerican Factory.\nIt was either on my\nFacebook feed or on the\n6 o\u2019clock news where I\nsaw a clip with Chinese\nemployees having a\nmeeting about how to\nbest interact with their\nAmerican colleagues. In\nthis clip phrases such as\n\u201cAmerican children are\nshowered with praise, so\neveryone who grows up in\nthe US is overconfident,\u201d\nand \u201cAmericans love\nbeing flattered to death\u201d\nare bashed around. This\nclip, alongside a recent\nAcademy Award win and\nhaving the Obamas as\nproducers, made this, for\nme, a must see. Directors\nJulia Reichert and Steven\nBognar start the story with\nthe closing of General\nMotors on the outskirts\nof Dayton, Ohio, one of\nthe many repercussions of\nthe 2007 financial crisis.\nFast-forward six years\nand Cao Dewang, billionaire founder of Fuyao, a\nChinese automobile glass\ncompany, has bought the\nfactory, bringing jobs, joy\nand enthusiasm to the area\nonce more. Workers are\nbrought in from factories\nin China to help show\nthe Americans their way,\nin the hope that eventually everything will be\npassed over to the Americans when ready. After\na suitably lengthed honeymoon phase, relations\nbetween the two cultures\nbegin to splinter as both\nparties realise that things\naren\u2019t like what they\u2019re\nused to at their previous\nfactories.\nOften we find clever\nediting and consumer\ndemand can alter the truth\ntelling aspects of news\nan angle in the Netflix\nspecial American Factory\n: A Conversation with the\nObamas. The downside\nto such \u2018pure\u2019 filmmaking\nreveals itself in the finale\nas we, the audience, look\nfor a conclusion and an\nidea of the future for\nthe factory. We almost\nget some semblance of\na coherent ending, with\nstaff reflecting on their\nnew lives in the factory,\nbefore, out of nowhere,\nwe swerve to reflect on\nmore recent events that\nhave nothing to do with\nthe previous two hours.\nFor me, this documentary manages to\nencapsulate America\npre-Trump. Things are not\nperfect, however every\nstruggle that people have\nin this documentary is\nnot politicalised to the\nextent that it is today.\nThis film simply explores\nthe interaction of people\nwith conflicting goals and\npressures. Managers and\nworkers alike from China\naim to create a respect\nand love for their home\ncountry in this small Ohio\ntown. They also have\nthe pressure of teaching\ninexperienced employees\nto get to a level of production matching factories\nthat have existed for over\nthirty years, all while\nliving hours and hours\naway from their families.\nOn the side of the Americans is the reality and\nadjustment of never being\nable to live with the same\ndisposable income they\nhad in their previous jobs\nwith General Motors,\nalongside a shocking drop\nin working conditions.\nNaturally it is the clashes\nthat acquire the most\nshock value and discus-sion, but it\u2019s the moments\nwhere the cultures try to\nunderstand each other\nwhich are the real jewels.\nOne storyline follows\na former employee of\nGeneral Motors. A horse\nloving, gun collector from\nthe midwest who when\nemployed by Fuyao,\nembraces the Chinese\nculture alongside sharing\nhis own, leading to\nhim calling his diverse\nco-workers \u2018his best\nfriends\u2019. When this staff\nmember eventually loses\nhis job, he is not angry,\nbut grateful, claiming to\n\u2018have learned so much\nfrom his friends\u2019 proving\nthat he got so much more\nfrom the experience than\njust employment.\nIwouldrecommendthis\nfilm for anyone looking\nto have a realistic view\non the different working\nclass conditions and pressures across the world. I\nwould also recommend\nthis for anyone living and\nworking in a place where\nthe blending of cultures\nis inevitable, which, fun\nfact, is Imperial. In the\nend, the cinematography\nand editing is wisely\nselected and natural\nfeeling. Despite a confusing ending, the point\nof American Factory is\nnot for everyone to live\nhappily ever after, nor is\nit for everyone to have\ntheir lives ruined by this\nfactory, it is just to portray\na raw and honest story of\npeople with lives different\nfrom our own.\nFuyao employees perform a musical tribute to windshields in one scene in the documentary // Netflix\n\u201cI recommend\nthis film for\nanyone in an\nenvironment\nwhere the\nblending of\ncultures is\ninevitable \u201d\nFILM\nJasmin Daley\nFilm Writer\nDir: Steven Bognar, Julia\nReichert.\n110 minutes\nAMERICAN FACTORY\n\u201cThis\ndocumentary\nis overwhelm--ingly organic,\nwith a\u2018pure\u2019\nfilmmaking\nstyle \u201d\nstories and documen-taries.

If\nyou\u2019re a postgraduate\nresearch student, you\nneed to get twice as\nlucky. A bad supervisor\ncan make your life miserable even if everything\nelse is great.\nDepartments will\noften defensively insist\nthat providing something\nis simply not possible,\nfor whatever reason,\nwhile the same might be\nstandard in other parts\nof College. For a lot of\nstudents, support in the\nform of good quality\nfeedback, early release\nof timetables, access\nto past papers, or even\njust a place to buy and\neat your lunch remain a\ndistant dream.\nMost differences\ncome from the unwillingness to change, or\nfrom a simple lack of\ncommitment. There\nis often an element of\npride involved, with\ndepartments claiming\nthey can\u2019t release past\npaper solutions or\nlecture notes because\ntheir subject is just so\nspecial and providing\ntoo much would ruin\nthe degree programme\nforever, even when the\nexperience of other\ndepartments shows the\nopposite.\nNot everything is the\ndepartments\u2019 fault, of\ncourse. Sometimes it\u2019s\njust really difficult to\nadvocate for student experience in an institution\nthat is run as a business.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how\ncampus costs you half of\nyour student loan, and\nthe shuttle bus you were\ngoing to take between\ncampuses is full for the\nthird time this week,\nyou will have few nice\nwords to say about your\n\u201cholistic student experience\u201d. Again, your perception will be wildly\ndifferent depending on\nwhich campus you are at\nor what room you won\nin the halls lottery.\nIf you think the\nCollege or the Union are\nnot aware . Every year,\nthe College is hit with\nthe students\u2019 frustration\nin the National Student\nSurvey, a questionnaire\nall undergraduate\nstudents are invited to\ncomplete just before\nthey graduate. A similar\nsurvey is taken by postgraduate students every\ntwo years.\nAs the Union, we\nproduce an \u201cNSS\nresponse\u201d (or a postgraduate equivalent one);\nafter reading through the\nhundreds of comments,\nwe come up with a set\nof recommendations\nthat we think would fix\nthese issues, or at least\nmitigate them. Parity\nof student experience is\noften addressed; implementing what is possible\nin some departments as\nthe standard across the\nwhole College would fix\na lot of problems. After\npresenting our little list\nof ideas to College, they\nusually smile and nod,\napprove our plan and\u2026\nand that\u2019s where the\nefforts often end.\nAt the top levels, the\nCollege and the Union\nare really good at making\nplans, but implementing\nthem has always been a\nchallenge. The College\n(or the Deputy President\n- Education) needs to sell\nthose plans to the faculties and faculty reps who\nin turn need to convince\nthe departments and dep\nreps who might end up\nimplementing them, but\nalso maybe not. On College\u2019s side, little effort\nis put into ensuring the\nUnion recommendations\nare followed on departmental level \u2013 after all,\nthose are not their plans\nanyway. The Union, on\nthe other hand, strongly\nbelieves in the potential\nof those plans, but lacks\nthe mechanisms to make\nsure change actually\nhappens; the academic\nrep network in its\ncurrent state is mostly\ndysfunctional, toothless,\nand isn\u2019t unified in\naction.\nIf we want to effectively fight for parity of\nstudent experience, we\nneed to work together\nacross departments and\nfaculties; without a\nproper rep community,\nwe remain blissfully\nunaware of what could be\nimproved and are unable\nto share good practice.\nWithout knowing the\npeople who create these\nplans or understanding\nthe reasoning behind\nthem, a rep can hardly\nput their whole heart in\nthem and fight for them\non departmental level.\nOur strategies need to\nbe put together by the\nwhole rep community,\nsharing the hard won\nknowledge that comes\nwith experience, not just\nindividuals at the top.\nBetter support and\npreparation are also\ndesperately needed.\nCurrently, the training\nfor reps is provided too\nlate and it fails to teach\nthose that are new to the\nrole important skills for\ndoing our job \u2013 basics\nof effective negotiation,\nteam management skills,\nor even simple stuff like\nhow to chair a meeting\nand what to prepare for\ngoing into one. Even if\nI am sold on a plan, it is\nof no use if I don\u2019t know\nhow to sell it further.\nWe have over a\nhundred active reps at\nImperial and they\u2019re\ndoing a good job, but\nunfortunately their full\npotential is yet to be\nfully unleashed. Until\nthen, your flatmate\u2019s department will probably\nstill be better than yours.\nIt was the best of meetings, it was the worst of meetings // Thomas Angus, Imperial College\n\u201cAt the top\nlevels the\nCollege and\nthe Union are\nreally good\nat making\nplans but\nimplementing\nthem has\nalways been a\nchallenge\u201d\nmany Learning and\nTeaching Strategies\nwe produce; if you can\njust about afford rent in\nhalls, buying lunch on\n\n"

Sonic the\nHedgehog was an unexpected announcement a\ncouple years ago when it\nwas first revealed; after\nmuch controversy and a\ncomplete redesign we can\nfinally sit down and absorb\n1 hour and 40 minutes\nof Paramount produced,\nSega filled goodness.\nWatching this in half\nterm may have been a\nmistake as I was surrounded by screaming children\nand grumpy mothers who\nhad no idea who the blue\nfurball on the screen was,\nbut hey, that\u2019s just part\nof the fun of going to the\ncinema!\nThe story begins with\nthe eponymous Sonic\nfleeing from enemies in\nhis home world, jumping\nthrough a ring portal to\nescape danger. He ends up\nin a small village called\nGreen Hills (named after\nthe first Sonic world\n\u2018Green Hill Zone\u2019). Sonic\nmust remain hidden but\none day produces so much\nenergy that he becomes\na two-legged, blue EMP\nthat naturally garners\nattention from the govern-ment. From this point on\nSonic must flee from the\ncharismatic and maniacal\nDr. Robotnik (played by\nJim Carrey) with the help\nof Tom \u2018Doughnut Lord\u2019\nWachowsky (played by\nJames Marsden), all the\nwhile trying to find his\nrings to let him escape\nthrough another portal.\nThe rest of the movie\nplays out like a typical\ngame of cat and mouse (or\neggman and hedgehog?)\nSonic won\u2019t be\n\u201cclich\u00e9s that\npresent\nthemselves\nthroughout\nthe story\u201d\n\u201csurprisingly\nbrilliant; slow-mo shots\nand big set\npieces were\nexcellently\nexecuted\u201d\nwinning any awards for\nstory, but this spin on the\nfastest hedgehog in the\nword makes for a nice\ndeparture from the video\ngames. Some may find the\nunfaithfulness to source\nmaterial annoying, with a\nlot of what Sonic can do\nbeing highly exaggerated\nor completely made up\u2026\nbut come on guys - it\u2019s\nSonic.\nOne complaint I do\nhave about the movie is\nthe clich\u00e9s that present\nthemselves throughout the\nstory; only so many times\ncan I hear the phrase \u2018my\nFRIEND\u2019 uttered before I\nbegin to cringe. Another\nissue is the occasional\noverreliance on potty\nhumour. I have nothing\nagainst it, but when it is\npoorly timed it can just\nfeel entirely pointless and\nunnecessary.\nHowever, I must give\ncredit where credit is due;\nthe conversations between\nSonic and Tom did get me\nlaughing, with snappy\none-liners a growing\nconnection between the\ntwo creating some really\ncharming interactions that\nmade the stakes at the end\nof the movie feel more\nreal.\nAnother place that\nSonictheHedgehogshines\nhas to be in its music. The\nsoundtrackwas one area\nthat remained faithful to\nthe games, with remixes\nof Green Hill Zone\n(amongothers) creating a\ntonal consistency within\na nostalgia driven melody.\nNostalgia is one thing\nthat Paramount and Sega\nreally did right here. From\nSonic constantly referring\nto Robotnik as \u2018Eggman\u2019,\nto Sonics idle animation\nin the original game being\nshown off in style as he is\nshot in slow motion from\nall directions, I constantly\nfelt my childhood flow\nback to me. My favourite\nmoment had to be when\na child gave Sonic some\nnew shoes to replace his\nold worn out ones: red\ntrainers reminiscent of\nthe classic Sonic shoes he\nwears in the game.\nThe action scenes as\nwell were surprisingly\nbrilliant; slow-mo shots\nand big set pieces were\nexcellently executed,\nfar better than any video\ngame movie deserves to\nbe. Whether you think\nthe redesign was always\nintended or not, you have\ngot to give it up to the\nanimation team for producing such high-quality\nCGI throughout the film.\nThe immediate comparison for this movie\nhas to be last years\nDetective Pikachu. While\nSonic looks to speed past\nPikachu in the box office,\nI think they are pretty\nequal endeavours.\nWhether you enjoy one\nover the other will really\ndepend on where your\nloyalty lies as a fan. Either\nway though, it is great to\nsee the world of video\ngame movies growing\ngiven the typical low\nquality that has plagued\nsimilar attempts in the\npast. With a post credit\nscene setting up a potential sequel, I am looking\nforward to what more\ncould come from Sega in\nthe future!\nOverall, Sonic the\nHedgehog was a great\nnostalgia trip for me and\na great introduction to\nthe titular character for\nyounger audiences. It both\nserves as a respectful adaptation of the character,\nwhilst equally standing\non its own right as a mild\naction movie. I would\nhave liked to see less crude\n\u201cSonic the Hedgehog\u201dmovie poster // Wikipedia\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nDirector: Jeff Fowler.\nGenre: Fantasy/Sci-fi\nSonic the Hedgehog\nDoes nostalgia win out over crude humour and clich\u00e9 moments?\nhumour and less clich\u00e9\nmoments \u2013 however,\ngiven that the movie is\nlikely looking to appeal to\na wide audience of mainly\nchildren, I can forgive its\nshortcomings. All in all, I\nhad a good time watching\nthis; It is nothing to write\nhome about, but it makes\nme look forward to the\nworld of video game\nmovies and that in itself is\na wonderful thing. 3.5/5!\n\n"

    "content": "Spinach andAgushi: Dishing out Massive Warm Hugs\nin the Form of Ghanaian Stews\nFOOD\nEllie Fung\nFood Editor\nI\nhad the brilliant idea\nof suggesting a little\nday trip to Portobello\nRoad Market on the\nweekend of storm Dennis.\nLow grey storm clouds\nhung over normally picturesque Notting Hill that\nmorning, a dreary backdrop to the pastel pallor\nof characteristic petite\nhouses. Having lived in\nLondon for half a year\nnow, gloomy mornings are\nsomething I\u2019ve become\naccustomed to, but none\nof them were as tenacious\nin warning about an imminent downpour.\nIcy wind slipped\nthrough the tiniest gaps of\nour coats as we made our\nway to Portobello Road,\nsteadily diminishing my\nnaive optimism for the\nclouds to part and for the\ntiniest sliver of sunlight to\nmake its way through. By\nthe time we approached\nthe stretch of tented stalls\nbearing colourful fresh\nproduce and whimsical\nantique trinkets, my\nface and fingers were\nnumb, simply yearning to\nwrap around something,\nanything, warm.\nFromadistance,wesaw\nbillows of steam emerging\nfrom a bright orange tent.\nNaturally, our shivering\nselves gravitated towards\nit, a promise of warmth\nand cosiness. Soon\nenough, we were staring\nat an impressive spread\nof massive pots, each\nproudly bearing a mouth-watering, hearty-looking\nstew. There was one with\nchunks of meat bathed\nin a rich orange sauce\nthat exuded a delicious\npeanutty aroma, and\nanother filled with an\nabundance of bright\ngreen spinach immersed\nin a fragrant amber stew.\nIt was truly a sight (and\nscent) to behold.\nAs if the steaming\npans of tantalising stews\nweren\u2019t enough, the man\nin the tent called out\nhumourous greetings,\ndrawing curious passers-by, including us, closer.\nThe easy-going vendor\nintroduced us to the array\nof Ghanaian stews before\nus, each sounding more\ndelicious than the last. We\nknew we just had to get\nsomething as we watched\nhim dole out heaping\nladles of hot stew into\nrice-filled boxes.\nWhat I love is how\nflexible the menu is. You\ncan get a jollof box with\none stew and jollof rice for\n\u00a36-7 or get a combination\nbox with two stews and\nrice for \u00a31 extra. There\nare 6 stews to select from\non the permanent menu,\nincluding vegan, chicken,\nbeef, and fish options, as\nwell as weekly specials\nto keep things fresh. If\nyou\u2019re indecisive (or just\n\u201cIt was a much-needed care\npackage of\nwarmth and\ncolour on that\nbleak day\u201d\n\u201cTogether, the\nhearty stews\nand jollof\nrice simply\nnourishes and\nwarms you\nfrom the inside\nout\u201c\nplain ravenous), you can\neven go for all the stews.\nWe opted for a fully vegan\ncombination box with the\nsignature spinach and\nagushi and black-eyed\nbean stews, upgrading it\nto a large box for another\n\u00a31 as we were sharing.\nThat\u2019s not all, of\ncourse. As we were\nordering, something else\ncaught my eye: plantains\nbubbling away to fried\nperfection in a vat of hot\noil. I just couldn\u2019t resist\nand added them to our\norder. As an accompaniment to the combination\nbox, it costs an additional\n\u00a31.50, racking the total up\nto \u00a39.50 between the two\nof us. If it were just me,\nhowever, a regular-sized\nbox would be more than\nsuffice as the portions are\nquite generous, making\nthis a wallet-friendly\nlunch option.\nThe box we received\nwas glorious to both the\neyes and nose: a bed of\nsteaming, spiced rice\nbound by two fragrant,\norange stews with golden\ncoins of plantain and\nchopped green onions\ngenerously scattered on\ntop. It was definitely\na much-needed care\npackage of warmth and\ncolour on that bleak, chilly\nday. My spirits were lifted\nfrom the first bite, and I\u2019m\nnot even exaggerating.\nJust ask my companion; he\ncan confirm the sustained\nexpression of delight on\nmy face as we ate.\nFor those in the\nunknown, agushi (or egusi\nas it\u2019s more commonly\nknown) is the seed of\nsquash, melon or gourd,\nacting as a common ingredient in West African\ncuisine and is rich in\nproteins, fats, vitamins\nand minerals. In its ground\nform, it is a popular ingredient in stews across\nWest Africa, and here at\nSpinach and Agushi, we\nsampled a Ghanaian vari-ation. Despite the layer of\nbright red chilli oil on top,\nthe namesake stew was\nnot greasy whatsoever\nand carried only a mild\nspice. It was deliciously\nfragrant and brimming\nwith warm spices, with\nthe agushi adding substance and creaminess to\nthe tender spinach leaves\nwithout weighing you\ndown. I would even go\nso far as to say that even\navid spinach-haters would\nenjoy this stew \u2013 the leafy\ntaste is masked by the\nhow flavourful it is.\nThe black-eyed bean\nstew had a completely different flavour profile, but\nwas also packed full of\nflavour despite being a bit\nmore watery. The beans\nthemselves were cooked\nnicely, soft and starchy but\nnot overly mushy, adding\nnuttiness and heartiness to\nthe overall dish. Let\u2019s just\nsay there\u2019s a (very good)\nreason why beans and\nrice are eaten together in\nso many cuisines. Now, I\ndon\u2019t know quite enough\nabout jollof rice to make\na comment about Spinach\nand Agushi\u2019s version\n(you\u2019d have to go back to\nlast week\u2019s issue for that),\nbut it paired beautifully\nwith the stews, soaking up\nevery last bit of flavour.\nTogether, the stews and\nrice simply nourish and\nwarm you from the inside\nout.\nOne more thing: please\ndon\u2019t skimp on the fried\nplantains. As they had\njust been freshly pulled\nfrom the frying oil, they\nwere piping hot, just the\nway I like them. The mild\nsweetness of the plantains\noffers a tasty contrast\nto the hearty stews and\nsavoury rice, providing an\nextra dimension in terms\nof aesthetics, texture and\ntaste to the whole box.\nTo me, they are simply\na must-have accompaniment and completely\nworth the supplementary\n\u00a31.50. We polished off the\nwhole box, without letting\neven a single grain of rice\ngo to waste, and before it\nhad a chance to get cold,\na pretty astounding feat\non that freezing street if I\ndo say so myself. We were\nfull, not in a heavy, uncomfortably stuffed kind\nof way, but in a content,\nenergised way.\nI\u2019ll be honest: this is\nthe first time I had actual\nWest African food, so I\ndon\u2019t have much experience on that front, but\nthis has certainly given\nme a more than positive\nimpression on the cuisine.\nIt has made me so much\nmore keen to try out more\nregional dishes, and any\nfood capable of doing that\nis amazing in my book. I\nwould gladly visit weekly\nif I had the chance.\nSpinach and Agushi has\nother stands in Exmouth\n(Mondays to Fridays)\nand Broadway (Saturdays\nonly) Markets, as well\nas providing delivery\nservice, but can they set\nup a stall at the Tuesday\nfarmer\u2019s market already?\nA delightful marriage of warm, spiced flavours in a little takeaway box // Ellie Fung\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 28TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32\n\n"

The\nrally came on the fourth\nday of 14 days of strike\naction by members of the\nUniversity and Colleges\nUnion, who are in dispute\nover pensions and pay.\nMarkSerwotka,general\nsecretary of the PCS\nunion, pledged a donation\n\u201cin the thousands\u201d to the\nUCU hardship fund. Jane\nLoftus, president of the\nCWU postal workers\u2019\nunion, said the UCU\nstrikes are \u201ca fight for\nevery worker facing\nunfair pay, insecurity and\nNEWS\nRoddy Slorach\nImperial UCU Branch\nOrganiser\nattacks on their pensions.\u201d\nOther speakers included\nshadow chancellor John\nMcDonnell.\nJosh Holland, a UCU\nrep at University College\nLondon (UCL), told the\nrally, \u201cPeople have taken\na huge hit in their pay\npackets. Some people\nearn between \u00a312 and \u00a317\nan hour, and they don\u2019t get\npaid for all the hours they\nspend doing preparation.\nWe need your solidarity.\u201d\nSome UCU members,\nespecially those on lower\nwages, worry about losing\n14 days pay. Reps at the\nrally appealed for donations to local strike funds,\nand a need to counter\nimpressions that UCU\nmembers are all highly\npaid academics. Many\nare in fact on insecure or\ncasualised contracts and\nare low paid. Some say\nthey can\u2019t afford to strike\nfor all 14 days, so may\nneed to get help from\nhardship funds.\nOver the Christmas\nperiod, 15 UCU branches\nre-balloted and met the 50\npercent turnout threshold\nrequired for legal strikes.\nThis round of walkouts is\nthe biggest yet, involving\naround 50,000 UCU\nmembers at 74 universities across Britain.\nOver 3,000 people have\njoined the UCU since the\nstrikes began. On the same\nday as Tuesday\u2019s rally,\nmembership of Imperial\nUCU reached its highest\never figure.\nOur President Alice\nGast is now the UK\u2019s best-paid university vice-chan-cellor, enjoying a total\nrenumeration package\nof \u00a3554,000 (including\nthe rental value of the\napartment she occupies\non campus). College man-agement, however, refuse\nto make a meaningful pay\noffer that could end the\nstrikes.\nOur dispute is formally\nabout pay and pensions,\nbut it is also about the\nmarketisation of educa-tion. Universities see staff\nas overheads to be cut\nas they compete to make\nmoney from students,\ncharging ever-higher\ntuition fees. As one pick-et-line slogan says, \u201cGood\nteaching conditions are\ngood learning conditions.\u201d We ask students\nto support the strikes and\nvisit our picket lines. Our\nfight is your fight too.\nCont. from page 3\nyears. If anything, I\nthink the College and\nUnion are working more\nclosely together, and the\nUnion strategy is well-aligned with the College\nstrategy. I can\u2019t see that\nthat\u2019s going to change.\nFelix: The Leeds press\nrelease spoke about\nyour time at Imperial,\nbut perhaps more\nabout your previous\nrole at Leiden in the\nNetherlands. Do you\nthink your role there\nwas impactful in being picked?\nSB: They liked the\nfact that I\u2019ve had two\nuniversities in my career\nat which I was responsible\nfor education and student\nexperience. Leiden is\ndifferent to Imperial \u2013 it\u2019s\nmore comprehensive,\nit has humanities and\nsocial sciences as well, as\nLeeds does. It was both\ninnovation I brought here\nand the experience I had\nthere, where I also led on\nbig change programmes.\nIt was interesting that they\nlooked at all eight years\nof experience as a VP\n(Education).\nFelix: Lastly, one of\nthe things the Leeds\npress release talked\nabout was your\ndedication to inclu-sivity and diversity. A\ncouple of years ago,\nthere was some controversy over some\nTweets you reshared\nwhich some students\nconsidered to be\ntransphobic, resulting in an open letter\nbeing written. How\nwill you reassure\nLeeds students about\nthis matter?\nSB: I don\u2019t think there\nis much I need to say.\nI think what I did back\nthen, in talking to the students who were worried\nand issuing a statement,\nenabled us to come\ntogether very well and\nthere has been no issue\nat all here. That worked,\nwe are happy with where\nwe are at currently. My\nconviction to inclusivity\nand diversity remains\nand is unwavering. So I\ndon\u2019t think there will be\none when I go to Leeds.\nI would like to leave it\nat that. If students there\nneed reassurance, I\u2019ll say\nexactly the same as when\nI reassured students here.\nSimone Buitendijk, VP (Education) and soon-to-be VC at Leeds // Thomas Angus\nTop: Final rally at the March for Education\nBottom: Standing room only at Tuesday's rally\n// Roddy Slorach\n\n"

Snowy tree crickets,\nto be exact, whose pitch\nand tempo changed according to their ambient\ntemperature. This audio,\npart of Josh Wodak\u2019s seed\nin Space/sound in time,\nwas constructed from\nsamples of the cricket and\nmapped to the changes\nin temperature of three\ndifferent Wollemi Pine\nsamples; one in a seed-bank, one in its natural\nhabitat in a distant gully,\nand one on its lonely journey to the International\nSpace Station.\nThe Habitat of Time\nis an exploration of how\nwe can present time in a\nmodern context, where\ninformation travels great\ndistances almost instantaneously and a transitory\nmoment can be captured\nand recalled anywhere,\n\u201cThis is an\nintimate\nexhibition\nwhose\ncomposition\nmakes it easy\nto become\nabsorbed in\nits surreal,\ndisconnected\natmosphere\u201d\nat any time, indefinitely.\nIt is therefore quite\nfitting, that the gallery\nitself feels suspended in\na bubble, sheltered from\nthe bustling streets around\nKing\u2019s Cross.\nVisually, the piece that\nfirst caught my attention\nwas Eva Nolan\u2019s The\nPinned Moth Cannot Fly,\na hypnotic animation\nof black-on-white concentric circular patterns,\nwhich, upon closer\ninspection, unravel into\ngraphite drawings of\nwinged insects blending\nand intertwining with\nflora. As it zooms ever\nfurther inwards, towards\nits centre, the intricate\nlinework that connects\nthe different species and\nkingdoms is revealed. Its\nnamesake is a reference to\ntaxonomy and its implications for how we perceive\nthe divisions between life\nforms across scales of\ntime. Even without this\ncontext it is still aesthetically mesmerising.\nWalking around the\nmain room of the gallery\nI spotted the first piece I\nsaw on the exhibition\u2019s\nwebsite, James Geurts\u2019\nTrajectories II: Prebiotica:\na black dot, encompassed\nby a blot of brown dye,\nwith some faint black\nlines drawn on top. A very\nunassuming piece, to say\nthe least. But at its heart\nlies the oldest known\nmaterial on Earth, found\nin a meteorite. There\nwas something humbling\nabout seeing the traces\nof this ancient substance\nsuspended in a lightbox,\nmeasured, identified and\nanalysed. Its journey to\nEarth took place over an\nunfathomably long time\ncompared to my exist-ence, past and future, and\nyet here it was in front of\nme, presently.\nBut my favourite part of\nthe exhibition was tucked\naway in a dark side room,\nwith a singular bench at\nits center and bean bags\nstrewn across the floor. On\none side, RobertAndrew\u2019s\nPresence in Time evolved\nonscreen, with mixtures\nof geological materials\nand pigments cascading\nand producing wonderful\ncontrasts of red, white\nand black - emergent,\nunpredictable patterns.\nJames Geurts\u2019 Ark was\nprojected onto the other\nwall; a grainy, decaying\nsample of film footage,\nleft exposed to the environment in which it was\ncaptured. I sat in front of\nthis film for a very long\ntime, alone, watching\nthe flickering images of\nforeign hillscapes. In\nthis fleeting moment, I\nwas the only person in\nthe world who could see\nthose aberrated pictures.\nBy sacrificing the precision of photorealism, it\nfelt like they absorbed\nsome essence of their\nprovenance, something\nthat was a part of them\nbut which cannot hope to\nbe captured by a camera\nalone.\nThe Habitat of Time\nis an intimate exhibition\nwhose composition makes\nit easy to become absorbed\nin its surreal, disconnect-The Pinned Moth Cannot Fly by Eva Nolan // image courtesy the artist\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 28TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe accompanying image to seed in Space/sound in\ntime by Josh Wodak: a Wollemi Pine seed, with an\noverlaid sketch by Charles Darwin // image courtesy the\nartist and Julie Louise Bacon\nARTS\nAlex Moriarty\nArts Writer\nWhere?

A few days later,\nsubsequent allegations\nwere published stating\nthat government officials lacked confidence\nin Patel\u2019s abilities, with\nthe claims suggesting\nthat MI5 had withheld\ninformation from the\npolitician due to concerns regarding her\ncompetence. The validity of the accusations is\nunclear, with numerous\nconservative politicians,\nincluding former conservative party leader\nIain Duncan Smith, offering words of support\nfor Patel and dismissing the allegations as\nbaseless. An untiring\nadvocate of British identity and autonomy, Patel\nwas a leading figure in\nthe leave campaign and\na string of controversies have seen her gain\nnotoriety.\nBorn in London in\n1972, Patel has been\na formal member\nof the Conservative\nParty since she was a\nteenager. She undertook\na postgraduate degree in\nBritish Government and\nPolitics before securing\na position as an intern at\nthe Conservative Central\nOffice. After a three year\nstint in the conservative\nParty\u2019s press office,\nPatel went on to work\nfor a personal relations\nconsulting firm. Her\npolitical career began\nwhen she stood as the\nConservative candidate\nfor Witham in the 2010\nelections in which she\ngained a majority of\n15,196, a figure that increased to 19,554 in the\n2015 elections. In July\n2016, when Theresa\nMay came to power,\nPatel was appointed\nInternational Development Secretary, which\nsparked concerns within\nher department due to her\nopposition to foreign aid\nspending. She resigned\nthe following year after\nit was reported that she\nheld twelve meetings in\nTel Aviv, Israel, without\ninforming the Foreign\nOffice, resulting in\nmultiple politicians\naccusing her of breaching the ministerial code.\nPatel spent the next two\nyears as a backbencher\nbefore being appointed\nher current role of\nhome secretary by Boris\nJohnson in July last year.\nRegarding political\nideology, Patel is considered to be right of\nthe Conservatives. A\nself-proclaimed Thatcherite, the politician has\ncited Margaret Thatcher\nas being her political\nheroine. The home\nsecretary found herself\namid controversy over\nher tough stance on\ncriminal justice when\nshe revealed her support\nfor capital punishment\non an episode of question\ntime following her initial\nelection to the house of\ncommons. She has since\nretracted this position\nbut has remained\nintent on introducing\nsweeping measures to\ncurb criminal activity,\nwith the Home Office\ndeclaring earlier this\nmonth that 50,000 new\npolice officers will be\nneeded across England\nand Wales within three\nlevel and the salary of\na job offer. Under the\nsystem, potential immigrant workers would\nneed 70 points to be\npermitted to work in the\nUK, with an offer for a\nskilled job and fluency\nin English granting 50\npoints. The ultimate\naim of the system is to\n\u201creduce the levels of\npeople coming to the\nUK with low skills\u201d and\nduring a visit to Imperial\nlast week, the home secretary stated that the new\nimmigration system will\n\u201cenable the government\nto take back control of\nour own immigration\npolicy for the first time\nin decades\u201d. There have\nbeen concerns, however,\nthat the new system\nwill make it difficult\nfor businesses who rely\non low paid workers,\nsuch as farms and\ncatering companies, to\nrecruit new staff. Patel\nhas shown unwavering\nsupport for the change\nnonetheless, despite\nacknowledging that her\nown parents would have\nbeen prevented from\nimmigrating to the UK\nunder the system.\nThe Home secretary, Priti Patel // Wikimedia\n\u201cShe revealed\nher support\nfor capital\npunishment on\nan episode of\nquestion time.\u201d\nyears.

However,\nwhile it is currently being\nused for the analysis of\nrelationships between\nprevention, diagnosis\nor treatment techniques\nand patient outcomes,\nthe potential of AI in\nmedicine has an expanse\nof directions in which it\ncan further develop.\nOnly last week, researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed they\nhad harnessed the powers\nof machine learning to\nidentify a promising new\nantibiotic compound\nthat can kill many of the\nworld\u2019s most problematic\ndisease-causing bacteria.\nImportantly, tested in the\nlaboratory and in two\ndifferent mouse models,\nthe new compound also\nworked against those\nresistant to all currently\nknown antibiotics.\nThe computer model\nused in their research, published in Cell, can screen\nmore than 100 million\nchemical compounds\nin just a few days, and\nwas designed to identify\npotential candidates for\nantibiotics that would kill\nbacteria using different\nmechanisms than those of\nexisting drugs.\n\u201cWe wanted to develop\na platform that would\nallow us to harness the\npower of artificial intelligence to usher in a new\nage of antibiotic drug\ndiscovery,\u201d says James\nCollins, the Termeer\nProfessor of Medical\nEngineering and Science\nin MIT\u2019s Institute for\nMedical Engineering and\nScience and Department\nof Biological Engineering.\nOver the past few\ndecades, development\nof new antibiotics has\nstagnated, with most new\ntreatments being simply\naltered variants of existing\ndrugs. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of new antibiotics is extremely costly\nand time consuming, so\nthe rising capabilities of\nAI could significantly\nimprove drug discovery.\nThe importance of this\nis even greater in the\nemerging era of antibiotic\nresistance, as increasing\nnumbers of pathogenic\nbacterial strains develop\nresistance to not only one,\nbut multiple, and in some\ncases even all, antibiotics.\nThe concept of usingAI\nfor this is not new \u2013 due\nto insufficient accuracy,\nearlier AI methods were\nnot appropriate for use for\nin silico drug discovery. In\nthis study, the researchers\nfocused on targeting E.\ncoli, training the model on\naround 2,500 molecules,\nincluding around 1,700\nFDA-approved drugs\nwith diverse structure and\nfunction, and tested it on\na library of over 6000\ncompounds. The molecule\nchosen for its strong antibacterial activity, novel\nstructure and low toxicity\nwas named halicin, and\nwas shown to be effective\nagainst virtually every\nspecies tested (including\ncommonly resistant C.\ndifficile, and M. tuber-culosis), bar one lung\npathogen, in laboratory\ntests. It was also successful in mice infected with\nA. baumanii, a bacterial\nstrain resistant to all\nknown antibiotics.\nThe mechanism by\nwhich halicin is thought\nto kill bacteria is through\ndisruption of the electrochemical gradient across\nthe cell membrane, inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production,\nthe molecule responsible\nfor providing vital energy\nin cells, thus inducing cell\ndeath. This is difficult to\ndevelop resistance to as\nit would require multiple\nmutations to combat,\nand likely need sustained\nevolutionary change, thus\nhighlighting an area for\nfurther exploration.\nIn the future, the team\nwant to examine halicin\nfurther, with hopes of\ncollaborating with a pharmaceutical company for\npotential use in humans.\nThe team also identified\neight other promising antibacterial candidates using\nthis AI model, which will\nbe tested further in the\nfuture, as well as developing other functionalities of\nthe model, such as more\nprecise targeting of path-ogenic, but not beneficial,\nbacteria in the patients.\nIt is also hoped that it\nwill be able to design\nnew drugs, based on\nwhat it has learned about\nthe common chemical\nstructures within drugs\nand the effects they have.\nUltimately, it is clear that\nAI has come a long way\nfrom playing checkers\nand chess to combatting\nantibacterial resistance \u2013\nand we\u2019re one step closer\nto finally catching up.\nBacterial cultures on a Petri dish // Medical News Today\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

This\nnew series will certainly\nalleviate the pain of the\npeople rotting in prison\nfor defaulting on their TV\nlicence, since they will be\nspared the lectures of this\nterrible partnership.\nThe TIME\u2019s Person of\nthe Year 2019 has indeed\nbeen frightening the\nwhole world since 2018,\nwhen aged only 15 \u2013 and\nfull of conviction! - she\ngave a speech before the\nSwedish Parliament. In a\ncontemporary fashion, she\nquickly gained attention,\nand almost immediately\nbecame the ultimate icon\nfor climate activism.\nI share with Greta\nThunberg, as with most\ncitizens of the developed\nworld, a love of nature,\nanimals, trees, wind,\nrain, sun and sea; forests,\ndogs, flowers, dolphins,\nand elephants. I even like\nrats, unlike most people.\nBut more important in my\nheart than any of these are\nhumans (as they should be\nin everybody\u2019s). Not the\nwealthy, but the destitute.\nI would therefore like to\nexplain how I do dare to\nsteal Greta\u2019s dreams.\nFirst, I must insist on\nwhat I deem ecologism\nto be really about. It has\nnow become a wide-ly-held belief that our\nsociety is destroying the\nplanet, that species are\nendangered due to human\nactivities, and that, if we\nstay inactive, the planet\nwill soon be an ocean\nof plastic, and the sky a\nhuge cloud of smoke and\npollution. Therefore, the\nonly reasonable solution\nto this terrible apocalypse\nis supposedly economic\ndegrowth. Indeed, growth\nmeans frantic consump-tion, which implies frantic\nproduction,whichrequires\nan enormous amount of\nenergy. Producing energy\ninvolves pollution, at\nleast until the appearance\nof a major technological\nbreakthrough. Therefore,\nbuying fewer products,\ntravelling less, walking\ninstead of driving, or\nindeed damaging the\naviation sector could\nperhaps save the planet.\nOr so ecologists like Greta\nThunberg would have us\nbelieve. I acknowledge\nthat their rationale is\nsound: degrowth would\nrequire less energy and\nthus produce less pollu-tion. Yet they tend to omit\nwhat degrowth would\nalso take away: teachers,\nhospitals, doctors, even\nfreedom (e.g. of travel).\nAs a matter of fact,\ngrowth is a sign of how\nhopeful we are of what\nto expect in the future.\nIt is therefore absolutely\nunderstandable that those\ncatastrophists are advocates of degrowth.\nHowever, the political\nclass is still filled with\nmembers of this evil old\nworld who brought peace,\nSUSTAINABILITY\nIs Greta Thunberg\u2019s vision compatible with keeping the standard of living? // Wikimedia\nSUSTAINABILITY\nISSUE 1745\nFELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAlberto Begue\nSustainability Writer\nbetter living conditions\nand comfort to society.\nWho could argue this is\nnot a result of economic\ngrowth \u2013 whose closest\nsynonym is technological\nprogress?\nBecause of ideologists\nfrightening everybody,\nespecially the youth, politicians nowadays all want\nto save the planet (yes,\nvery importantly in green\nfont). This has become\nan irrefutable hypothesis:\nthe planet is in danger and\nour number one priority\nis to save it. For instance,\nit even became a central\nargument of PM Boris\nJohnson\u2019s campaign.\n\u201cGet Brexit done\u201d in\norder to fight climate\nchange. To achieve this\ngoal, politicians purport\nto be ready for everything\nbut degrowth. It would\nobviously bring discord\nand poverty, and nobody\nwants to be responsible\nfor it. That\u2019s why there\nare more and more what\nwe could call green laws,\nall around the world (my\nown country, France, is a\ngood example, but the UK\nis another), such as laws\nto force a decrease in the\nconsumption of plastic,\ntaxes on car owners, etc.,\nwhose only purpose is\nto please sanctimonious\nvoters. But does it please\nthe ecologist preachers?\nNo, of course not - they\nsee it as pure hypocrisy,\nand I agree with that view.\nIndeed, should our\ngoal be to save the planet\nwithout considering\nhuman interests, then\nobviously we would need\ndegrowth. I could take\nthis point even further: we\nwould need mass suicide,\nas all human life pollutes.\nLuckily, ecologists\nhave been proven wrong\nseveral times before. One\nof the first, Paul Ehrlich,\nwrote in The Population\nBomb (1968) that the\ndemographic boom would\ncreate famine, epidemic,\nand war. According to\nhim, the only solution\nwas to initiate a huge\ncampaign of sterilisation\nin some parts of the globe.\nA few years later, in 1972,\nthe Club of Rome published a report announcing devastating shortages\ndue to frantic growth.\nWhile these hard-working\nintellectuals were playing\nNostradamus, engineers,\nbusinessmen, doctors,\nscientists and politicians\nunited their efforts to\ndevelop agriculture, as\nwell as to find ways to\nprevent epidemics, and\nso on. Thanks to them,\nnone of these predictions\nof apocalypse turned out\nto be right. Now, Greta\nThe true threats of climate change: democracy and capitalism\n\u201cdegrowth\nwouldalsotake\naway: teachers,\nhospitals,\ndoctors and\neven freedom\n(e.g. of travel)\u201d\n\u201ccapitalism\nand democracy\nhave proved\nto be the best\nframework for\nfreedom to\nthrive\u201d\nThunberg is obviously the\nheir of those who wanted\nto sterilise the populations\nthey judged to be growing\ntoo fast\u2026\nTherefore, advocates\nof degrowth leave us\nno choice but to insist\non that obvious truth:\ncapitalism and democracy\nhave proved to be the best\nframework for freedom to\nthrive and for living conditions to improve. Let us\nconsider an example that\nconcerns us all in London:\nthe river Thames. It is at\nits most biodiverse for\ncenturies! That is certainly\nnot the result of economic\ndegrowth forcing people\nto work less, earn less,\nconsume less and have\nfewer children. It is indeed\na direct consequence of\nthe opposite. To clean the\nriver Thames, solutions\nhave indeed been found\nwithinthecapitalistframe-work, while democracy\nhas ensured the freedom\nof all citizens. Why is\nthat? Because, unlike\nwhat Greta would have\nus believe, the protection\nof the environment and\navoiding wasting resources does not only please\nthe nature-loving-citizens,\nit is also in the companies\u2019\ninterests.\nSo, yes, dear Greta, I\nwill steal your dreams if\ntheyaredreamsofpoverty,\nmisery and illnesses in\ndark green forests and\nchoose instead hospitals,\ncomfortable housing, and\nfreedom in increasingly\ndeveloped countries, all\naround the world.\n29\n\n"

With the one\nwe have, why would we\nneed any more? Would resources not be better spent\ncentralised supervised by\nfull time staff as opposed\nto underqualified student\nvolunteers. I would\nstrongly argue, however,\nthat it is these parts of our\nhistory that are important\nto preserve. In fact it is\nthe experience that I have\nwith the larger Union that\nmakes me so convinced\nof the importance of the\nCUs. While Union staff\nhave the benefit of being\nfull time and sometimes\nexperience in the role that\nthey take on, they lack\nan understanding of the\nunique circumstances and\nchallenges of studying\nin London that students\ngrasp implicitly. The\nadvantage of having currently studying students\nin these roles and able to\nimplement policy can\u2019t,\ntherefore, be overstated.\nI fear, however, that in\nrecent years the star of the\nConstituent Unions has\nbeen wanning. Students\nnow are more likely than\never to affiliate themselves to their department\nand departmental society\nrather than their union and\nfriends of mine that are\ninvolved in the CUs talk\nabout the first challenge\nof organising events being\ntelling students what they\nare.\nI think the remedy\nfor this is boldness on\nthe part of the students\ninvolved in the running\nof the CUs. The long\nand terminal decline will\nnot cease unless drastic\naction is taken to halt it.\nTo find examples of what\nto do we must look to the\nthat offer a more relaxed\nand enjoyable sense of\ncamaraderie than the\nmore serious university\nlevel sports teams have\nbeen successful, both in\ninforming students what\nthe RSM is and binding\ntogether those under its\nmantle.\nThis should be the first\nact on the part of the other\nCUs. Not only are there\nother teams with whom\nto naturally compete but\ntraining could be done\ntogether and experience\npooled in order to keep\ncosts low. An annual\ncompetition between the\nCU teams would be sure\nto draw a crowd and be\na good source of revenue\nfor CUs that have found\nthemselves struggling to\ndefine their purpose as\nattention fades.\nThe second act of the\nCU committees should be\nto bring onboard departmental societies. Rather\nthancompetingforstudent\nattention student volunt-ers should swallow their\npride and remember that\neveryone got involved in\norder to improve student\nexperience, not to fight\nover trivial matters.

The\nsocietal outcomes of the\nvirus created economic\nuncertainties and losses in\nthe markets. Let us start\nby getting an understanding of the virus, followed\nby exploring its economic\nimpacts.\nBackground\nThe novel coronavirus\nis part of the family of\nCoronaviruses (CoV).\nThis family includes\ndiseases such as Middle\nEast Respiratory\nSyndrome (MERS-CoV)\nwill be looking at SARS\nin 2002 because of the\nsimilarities it shares with\nthe novel coronavirus.\nSARS was discovered\nin Guangdong province\nin southern China. It has\nspread to 26 countries\nand has resulted in 774\nconfirmed deaths. During\nthis time, the US invaded\nIraq, which would have\ninfluenced the markets as\nwell. Hence making it difficult to decouple the two\nevents and the combined\nimpacted it had on the\nmarkets. So does this\nmean that we should not\nuse SARS as an indicator?\nImpacts of such diseases on markets\nThough it was mentioned earlier that SARS\ncould not be easily\ndecoupled from the Iraq\ninvasion, it does not\nsuggest that we should\nignore it. An article by\nthe Financial Times titled\n\u201cInvestors look to history\nfor clues on the market\nimpact of coronavirus\u201d\nbriefly discusses the\ngeneral impact of the viral\nepidemic on the stock\nmarket, which showed\nthat during SARS, the\nMSCI world index was\ndown by more than five\nper cent during that period\nbefore recovering.\nWhat can we then say\nabout the impacts?\nSince 2003, China\u2019s\nshare in the global Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP)\nhas risen to 18.69%. As\nGDP is an indicator of\nthe value of economic\nactivity, this may suggest\nthe impact the virus has\non China will have a\ngreater influence on the\nglobal markets compared\nto SARS.\nWe have already\nwitnessed the fall on the\n24th\nof February where\nthe Dow, S&P 500 and\nNasdaq Composite Index\neach dropped by more\nthan 3% each.\nA report from JP\nMorgan Research titled\n\u201cWhatIstheGlobalImpact\nFrom the Coronavirus\nOutbreak?\u201d mentioned\nthat Asian airline share\nprices took a hit during\n2003 but rebounded as\nsoon as there was greater\nconfidence in tourism and\ngoes further to mention\nthat global air traffic could\nbe flat in 2020 rather\nthan seeing a growth.\nAdditionally, cruise lines\naround the world would\nsee a decline in revenue. A\npost by MSCI titled \u201cThe\ncoronavirus epidemic:\nImplications for markets\u201d\nalso highlights similar\nsentiments and shows\nan increase in revenue\nfor China\u2019s healthcare\nsector and compares how\ncertain sectors in China\nand SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Like its family\nmembers, it is transmitted\nfrom animals (zoonotic in\norigin) to human beings.\nThis virus was reported\nin December 2019. Its\norigins were traced to\nWuhan, the capital of\nCentral China\u2019s Hubei\nprovince. Since then, the\nvirus has spread to 33\ncountries and has resulted\nin 80,239 confirmed cases\nand 2700 deaths (as of\n25/2/2020).\nFor comparisons, we\nperformed during the\nSARs outbreak as well as\ntheir performence amidst\nthis current outbreak.\nMost notably, the retail\nsector has seen a decline\nand Chinese consumers,\naccording to the Financial\nTimes, accounted for 40\nper cent of the \u20ac281bn\nspent on luxury goods\nin 2019. Some luxury\nbrands with supply chains\nreliant on China would\nsee further impacts on\nits revenue, resulting in\na dip that present fund\nmanagers with opportunities to buy in.\nIt is worth mentioning\nthat SARS was contained\nwithin 4 months and it is\nhighly unlikely that the\nnovel coronavirus would\nbe contained within\nthe same duration after\nreports of outbreaks in the\nMiddle East and Europe.\nThere is no telling how\nlong the outbreak will last\nand its impact on the stock\nmarket. For some inves-tors, this might be a time\nto sell and cut their losses\nwhile this might be an\nopportunity for others to\ninvest.\nNonetheless, this is a\ngood example of how re-al-world scenarios impact\nthe global markets and it\n\u201cthere is no\ntelling how\nlong the\noutbreak\nwould last\nand it\u2019s impact\nto the stock\nmarket\u201d\nalso gives us a glimpse\ninto the investment psychology of fund managers.\nThe Imperial College\nInvestment Society (ICIS)\nhosts interactive weekly\ninvestment meetings\nwhere our members have\nthe chance to present\ninvestment pitches,\nask questions and vote\non buy/sell decisions.\nWe offer competitions,\ncareer advice talks and\nguest lectures by industry\nexperts on a range of\nfinance topics.
