Despite\nmy preparations,\nI failed to get the\nFelix pages to the\nprinters in time and\nwe were unable to print\nthat week. This did not in\nthe long term mean a lot.

I left the office that\nnight lower than I believe I have ever\nfelt. I tied my self worth to that paper\nand when it did not arrive I saw that\nas my own total failure.

I\u2019m also worried about\nthe mental health implications a\npotential lockdown in halls could\nhave, how that could impact my\nstudies, work ability, and overall\nuniversity experience\u201d\nA student who was meant to come to campus has decided to attend the first term remotely\n\u201cI decided studying in Portugal until January would be the best option because this\nwould allow me to be home if there was a\nsecond massive outbreak. Right now what\nI am most worried about is the fact that\nthere will still be some practicals, and even\nthough the university has assured online\nstudents that this will have no impact or affect us in any way I am slightly concerned\nthat I will be disadvantaged. On a more social side I am also a bit worried that when I\nget there in January there are already some\ngroups formed and everyone already knows\neach other quite well and that this will make\nmy integration in the university harder, as\nin October I would be in the same uncomfortable situation as everyone else.\u201d\nTwo sides of the coin\nbring them and being able to have some\nfreedom back. \u201cStudents kind of need\na light at the end of the tunnel in order\nfor them to sort of maintain their morale.\u201d\nNew students have been moving into\nhalls over the last two weeks, and although many of them and the College\nas well have taken extraordinary cov-id measures, Dan believes this is not\nenough.\nMost of the measures employed by\nthetwouniversitiesareverysimilarwith\nImperial seemingly going a step further\nby treating self isolating students with\nmore precautions by moving them to\nen-suite rooms and not letting them\nout under any circumstances. However,\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be much in terms\nof provisions for food, laundry cleaning\nor access to wellness activities. Being\ncooped up in a room for 14 days can\ndefinitely take a toll on the freshers.\nWithout putting in proper measures,\nthe risk of students not following the\nproper channels and taking the self isolation into their own hands is very pos-sible.\nA former Woodward resident who\nalso went on to be a hall senior at Pembridge said the following \u201cWhether it\nbe the Woodward lifts shared by hundreds of students or the Wilson house\nnarrow interminable hallway, or the\nkitchen shared by over 20 people in\nPembridge, there is no way infections\nwon\u2019t spread like wildfire if Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t put further measures in place.\u201d\nAfter a lot of media coverage and\ncontroversy, Glasgow eventually agreed\nto refund 4 weeks rent to students self\nisolating and give them a bit of money to spend on food delivery, Imperial\nhasn\u2019t made the same commitment but\na similar controversy could push the\nsame thing to happen.\nFormer Union President and anti-lockdown\ncampaigner Piers Corbyn comes to Imperial\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief\nOn Wednesday 7th\nOctober,\nformer Union President Piers\nCorby, brother of former Leader of\nthe Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn and\nanti-lockdown protestor attended\nImperial on the invitation of a student to hold a rally accusing Imperial\nacademics of being in the pay of Bill\nGates and working to establish a \u2018new\nnormal\u2019 and a \u2018new world order\u2019.\nInvited by Marwan Riach, himself a\nstauch anti-second lockdown advocate he took the opportunity to look\naround the Union and reminiss over\nhis experiences at the time. College,\nUnion and students were, howev-er, united in opposition to his visit.\nCollege security were in large attendance with security and police officers\ntogether outnumbering the small\nnumber of protestors.\nCorbyn gave a speech on Queen\u2019s\nlawn in front of a banner calling on\nthe government to take down 5G\nmasts, end mask wearing and social\ndistancing and halt any work on\nvaccine development. Mr Corbyn\nstudied physics when he attended\nImperial College.\nIn an interview Corbyn explained\nthat the dictatorial style of government that Britain was currently\nexperiencing was intended to weaken\nour immune systems by limiting social contact to make us vulnerable to\nother attacks and population control\nmeasures. He quoted Orwell a number of times asking students sitting\non Queen\u2019s lawn to consider whether\nthey could ever have tolerated the\nrestrictions put on them a year ago.\nWhen Mr Corbyn went to the\nUnion to try to get a drink he was\nblocked by members of Union security that shut all the doors and barred\nhim entry.\nThere was also a confrontation between students in the\nquad and Corbyn and\nhis fellow anti-lock-down protestors.\nOne student, Pierre\nVivier, a 3rd year\nMaths student said\nthat it was outrageous\nthat College and Union\nsecurity had allowed\nCorbyn onto College\ngrounds. \u201cWhat if\nthere was someone\nwith asthma?\u201d he\nasked.\nThe group of protesters left Beit and\ndispersed after this.\nThey handed out flyers\nas they left advertising a \u201cDrink against\nthe Lockdown\u201d to be\nheld at 10pm on Old\nCompton road.\n\n"

Decrying\ncertain artistic principles as \u201clowbrow\u201d or, god-forbid,\n\u201cpopular\u201d became a powerful tool in preserving the\nstatus quo and controlling discourse around the arts.\nWhat is particularly baffling is how transparent this\ntechnique is, yet the concept endures. One only has to\nlook at the terms highbrow and lowbrow themselves\nto notice the connection to questionable skull-based\nstudies and the way the labels are applied further\nmakes a mockery of the distinction. Shakespeare, with\nits bawdy genital-based humour and cloying melodrama was the Elizabethan equivalent of today\u2019s Hollywood blockbusters and yet is quoted and performed\ntoday as the height of sophistication. The Mona Lisa,\nwith her hairline plucked back and eyebrows suspiciously absent was the epitome of highbrow art, and\nyet its popularity would prove to be its downfall. It is\ndecidedly highbrow to study Da Vinci and his contemporaries but to name the Mona Lisa as a favourite\nor an inspiration is decidedly lowbrow and common,\nlike calling Call Me Maybe a musical masterpiece. It\nisn\u2019t so much the content of the work which confers\nstatus \u2013 by all accounts, Call Me Maybe is a gen-re-defining moment of pure genius \u2013 but the way it is\nviewed and the audience who views it. In a post-mod-ernist landscape of blank canvases, Tracey Emin\u2019s My\nBed is lauded as ground-breaking fine art and my\nunmade bed is reported to Public Health England as a\npublic health hazard.\nIn The New York Times, Pankaj Mishra, award-win-ning essayist and novelist, offers an explanation for\nthe enduring rejection of common art, especially\nin America.

As\na reaction\nto an\nat-Highbrow vs Lowbrow:\nAn Arbitrary Divide\nThere\u2019s a hierarchy in the world of art.\nOpera sits on a lofty perch, high above its\nmodern counterpart, musical theatre, fanning itself with its 17th century orient-in-spired decorative hand fan. And if opera is at the peak\nof the pyramid and musical theatre its body, the underbelly is a writhing mass of Disney movie musicals\nlike High School Musical and Frozen, feeding on the\nrotting carcass of public appeal. A similar hierarchy\nexists for books: books about straight, white American men trumping graphic novels and comic books.\nMention manga and the art world collectively shrugs\nas if to say \u201cManga?

The Age of Enlightenment ushered in an era of\nhypothesis, reason, and experimentation \u2013 what would grow\ninto what we call the scientific\nmethod - and its effects trickled\nthrough all layers of society and\nculture. Royals and the clergy,\ntheir status given by God and\nconferred by blood, had their power and position\nquestioned and sometimes stripped away. Under this\nnew system, one would expect art to be released from\nthe shackles of class and pretension, and for all artistic\nforms to thrive in a field levelled of its snobbery. After\nall, how could you apply objective judgement to a subjective medium like the arts? However, society abhors\na vacuum, and while paradigm shifts may change the\nway the world is viewed, it rarely makes an impact\non the world itself.

Alter, Michael\nHoughton and Charles M.\nRice have been jointly awarded for their\nseminal research that\nled to the discovery\nof the hepatitis C\nvirus. The virus,\nas indicated in its\nname, causes chronic\nhepatitis, a scourge\nacross the globe that\nprecipitates cirrhosis\nand liver cancer, and is\nresponsible for over one\nmillion deaths annually.\nHepatitis, or liver inflammation, is\nchiefly caused by viral infections, the\ntwo main types of which were previously known to be hepatitis A and B.\nBetween them, the blood-borne hepatitis B is significantly more dangerous,\nremaining asymptomatic for many years\nuntil serious complications arise.\nIn the 1970s, blood tests for hepatitis\nB had reduced cases of transfusion-re-lated chronic hepatitis. Despite this, the\nsignificant number of remaining cases\ncaused concern for Harvey J. Alter and\ncolleagues working at the US National\nInstitute of Health, who suspected an\nunknown infectious agent. Using chim-panzees, the only viable host\nbesides humans, and\nrigorous methodical investigation,\nAlter demonstrated the\ntransmission\nof a characteristically\nviral agent,\ndistinct from\nboth hepatitis A\nand B.\nIn the wake of\nAlter\u2019s research, great\nefforts were made to\nidentify this mysterious agent, yet\nthe novel virus failed to be identified\nfor over a decade. Researchers at pharmaceutical company Chiron predicted\nthat a small fraction of the nucleic acids\npresent in the blood of infected chimpanzees would be derived from the vi-rus, and so set to work collecting DNA\nfragments. Then, using sera taken from\nhepatitis patients\ncontaining the antibodies against the\nvirus, Houghton and\ncolleagues were able\nto identify cloned\nDNA fragments\nencoding viral proteins from the elusive\ninfectious agent. Further research showed\nthat this belonged to\na novel RNA virus\nfrom the Flavivirus\nfamily and it was\nnamed hepatitis C.\nThe last step was\nto determine whether the hepatitis C\nvirus alone could\ncause hepatitis. Scientists set about investigating the virus\u2019s ability to replicate\nand cause disease. By observing genetic\nvariants in hepatitis C samples, Rice and\ncolleagues at Washington State University noted a region on the viral genome\nthat they suspected was important in\nvirus replication. Acting on this hypoth-esis, Rice engineered a special RNA variant of hepatitis C devoid of potentially\ndeactivating genetic variations. When\nthe RNA was injected into chimpanzee livers, Rice\nobserved pathological changes\nsymptomatic\nof the chronic\ndisease caused by\nhepatitis C. This\nacted as the proof\nthat hepatitis C\ncaused the unexplained cases of\ntransfusion-trans-mitted hepatitis,\nfinally concluding\nthe decades-long\njourney of scientific endeavour.\nThe discoveries\nof this year\u2019s three\nNobel Laureates\nhave revolutionised the fight against\nhepatitis across the globe. Highly\nsensitive blood tests can now mitigate\nthe risk of transfusion transmission\nand effective anti-viral drugs have been\ndeveloped.\nWhile hepatitis C remains a global\nhealth concern, thanks to the work of\nthese scientists, work towards eliminating the disease is now possible.\nThe 2020 Nobel Prizes\nWilliam Carter Science Writer\nPhoto credits: UK Government\nOver the course of three days this week, the 2020 Nobel Prizes for science were announced online.

We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no reason to assume that\nsomething that evolved separately on a\ndifferent body is going to use the same\nbiochemistry that we have \u2013 that it\u2019s going to use DNA, RNA, the Krebs cycle\nfor metabolism... So that\u2019s why it\u2019s sur-prising. We need to know whether that\u2019s\nthe case, because if it does turn out to\nhave DNA then the chances are that life\nevolved once in the Solar System and\nspread to other planets through asteroid\nimpacts... But if it turns out to be a separate origin of life,\nthen you\u2019ve got\ntwo planets, bang\nnext door to each\nother, and life has\nhappened twice,\nentirely inde-pendently. What\ndoes that say\nabout the distribution of life in\nthe universe? It\nmeans it\u2019s going\nto be really common.\u201d\nOn the possibility of there being a biological origin\nforthephosphine,DrClementssaidthat\nhis co-author Dr William Bains \u201cstill\nthinks there\u2019s a 90% chance that this is\njust chemistry that\nwe haven\u2019t found \u2013\nsome strange photo-chemistry that the\nweird environment\nof Venus was able to\ndo.\u201d\n\u201cObviously, we\nwould all love for it\nto be biological, but\nif there\u2019s a particular\nresult that you would\nlike to be the case,\nyou have to be that\nresult\u2019s worst enemy.\nThat\u2019s how responsible science is done. But I still really want\nit to be life.\u201d\nSo what next? The paper concludes\nthat next steps would be to conduct in\nsitu measurements or to do aerosol re-turn, i.e. sending a probe to Venus to\nstudy a sample. Mission concepts to visit\nthe Venusian clouds are being discussed\nat NASA but space missions notoriously\ntake years to launch. However, Dr Mueller-Wodarg remains optimistic: \u201cSometimes surprises happen, like the Venus\nExpress mission. It was developed over\nthe course of two years because it was\nmade from flight spares from several other missions, so a Venus mission is doable\nover a shorter amount of time.\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cMaybe this is the closest we\u2019ll ever get to a Nobel Prize \u2013 how\nabout that?\u201d\nCONTINUED\n\u201c\nIF THERE\u2019S A\nPARTICULAR\nRESULT YOU\nWANT, YOU HAVE\nTO BE THAT\nRESULT\u2019S WORST\nENEMY.\nTrump treated with experimental\nantibody cocktail\nDonald Trump, adept science denier\nand alternative facts authority, has\nbecome an unwitting participant in the\nscientific method.\nAfter testing positive for COVID-19\non early Friday morning, President\nTrump was flown to Walter Reed\nNational Military Medical Centre as a\n\u201cprecautionary measure\u201d.

    "content": "In a recent interview Sofia Coppola said she wanted\nto \u201ccapture what she loves about New York\u201d and\npair that with a father daughter story. She cites conversations she used to have with her own father\u2014the\ngreat Francis Ford\u2014about relationships and male psy-chology. On the Rocks does a stellar job at showing the\nfunny side of these conversations, but also in showing\nthe subtle adaptations fathers have to make, in order\nto stay a part of their daughter\u2019s life as they grow up.\nThe plot is simple and singular, though it tries to\nwork on two emotional fronts: the\nrelationship between Laura (Rashi-da Jones) and her father Felix (Bill\nMurray), and Laura and her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans). Laura, a novelist suffering from writer\u2019s\nblock, notices that her marriage has\nlost the spark it had long ago, and\nthat her husband appears to take\nmore and more business trips with\na female colleague. She attempts to\nfind in her father an ear to listen,\nbut instead she gets an ambitious\ndetective who, feeling starved of\nher attention, is determined to\nprotect her. Where Laura considers\n\u2018maybe just asking Dean\u2019, Felix calls\nfor \u2018following Dean\u2019 and \u2018tracking\nhis credit card transactions\u2019. Coppola\u2019s great sense for conversational\ndialogue lends even more warmth to\nalready great performances by Jones\nand Murray. Like in Lost in Translation, Murray strikes the right balance\nbetween assured exterior and yearning interior. The issue with the movie\narises in the second relationship,\nbetween Laura and Dean. They feel\nunintentionally artificial, and a little\nwooden at times. Despite the sumptuous cinematography, and deadpan\nbrilliance of Bill Murray, the movie\u2019s\nfinal act is disappointingly bland.\nLatest movie from Sofia Coppola\nNow on Netflix\nReviews\nTo create the capital-A Art that Kaufman so\nobviously relishes, his writing needs to be har-assed, not left in peace. His finest work, as writer\nor director, has always been subject to some sort of\nintellectual audit\u2014for example Spike Jonze as the\n\u2018auditor\u2019 of his writing in Being John Malkovich,\nAdaptation, and Synecdoche, New York. With I\u2019m\nThinking of Ending Things, Netflix have given him\nfree rein, with very polarising consequences. On\none hand, the first and final acts are brilliantly creative\u2014looking down the barrel of the capital-A Art\nthat Kaufman wants. The house sequence with Jessie\nBuckley and Jesse Plemons as the new couple, and\nToni Collette and David Thewlis as the bizarre but\nlovable parents, is both delicate and terrifying. On\nthe other hand, there are aspects of this movie, such\nas the second long car scene, that are a shade more\nself-indulgent than is bearable, despite the great cin-ematography. Kaufman die-hards will explain that\nit\u2019s \u2018cerebral\u2019 (as they like to say), but I think that\u2019s a\nsly pretext\u2014Kaufman can do better.\nNot being too familiar with Antonio Campos\u2019\ncatalogue\u2014except for his uninspiring 2016 movie Christine\u2014and seeing the star-studded cast, I\nwasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect from The Devil All\nthe Time. It follows a handful of initially disparate\nresidents of the small and deeply religious village of\nKnockemstiff, Ohio. Then, using a sort of \u2018Tarantinian grease\u2019, it attempts to slot everything together\nas tensions flare, and lusts for reprisal come face-to-face with religious propriety. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd knocks\nit out of the park as the caring father to protagonist\nArvin Russell (played by Tom Holland, whose performance is serviceable, though not remarkable). As\nArvin discovers the abuse of his sister at the hands\nof the school bullies and the new priest (Robert Pattinson), we feel the weight of his decision to either\ndescend into violence and go to jail, or be rational\nand hold together a family already under the cosh of\nlife\u2019s misfortunes. It perhaps overstays its welcome at\n138 minutes, but The Devil All the Time is an altogether fairly entertaining thriller.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the\nproduct\u201d. This documentary-drama features interviews with former engineers and managers from the\nworld\u2019s biggest tech companies, warning of the dangers of social media, often condemning the systems\nthey helped to create. In tandem with these inter-views, the film weaves in a drama about how social\nmedia can inveigle and entrap vulnerable young\nadults. Tristan Harris\u2014the film\u2019s central expert\u2014\nlays out the problems and their consequences very\neloquently, showing a strong desire to steer us into\ncalmer seas. The dramatic interludes could be entirely dispensed with, but the film succeeds in raising awareness of the predatorial designs of even the\nmost seemingly banal inventions. As the credits roll,\nthe movie does not end\u2014the message endures in the\nform of a healthy guilt, for all the times we\u2019ve acted\nunknowingly as pawns.\nEnola Holmes is yet another movie so concentrated on its end that it neglects its means. It is \u2018message\nfirst, movie second\u2019. By fixating on telling the tale of\na young woman rising above her societal constric-tions, the movie hurts both its plot and its message.\nMovies made to \u2018make a point\u2019 are most successful\nwhen they find an object to act as a formula for the\nemotion. The final message is made powerful by\nit being earned\u2014as opposed to just being thrown\nout there lazily. Through a combination of Helena\nBonham Carter\u2019s poorly integrated character, Sam\nClaflin\u2019s poorly written character, annoying 4th wall\nbreaks, and Henry Cavill\u2019s clear mis-casting as Sherlock Holmes, the film trips up\u2014drawing too much\nattention to its aim. Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s performance as the titular Enola Holmes is energetic, and\nher rapport with Louis Partridge\u2019s Lord Tewkesbury is, at times, entertaining; however, taken in its\nentirety, the film comes off as fairly middling and\nslightly strained.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir Film Editor\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nDirectedby: Sofia Coppola\nStarring: Rashida Jones; Bill Murray; Marlon\nWayans\nOn the Rocks\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n42\nI\u2019m Thinking of Ending\nThings\nDirectedby: Charlie Kaufman\nStarring: Jessie Buckley; Jesse Plemons; Toni Collette;\nDavid Thewlis\nEnola Holmes\nDirectedby: Harry Bradbeer\nStarring: Millie Bobby Brown; Henry Cavill; Sam Claflin; Helena Bonham Carter\nThe Devil All The Time\nDirectedby: Antonio Campos\nStarring: Tom Holland; Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd; Riley Keough;\nJason Clarke; Robert Pattinson\nThe Social Dilemma\nDirectedby: Jeff orlowski\nStarring: Tristan Harris; Aza Raskin; Justin Rosenstein\nUnfortunately lost in execution\n\n"

    "content": "Lockdown has become an incredibly\ncontroversial step which was taken\nin hopes of flattening the curve and saving lives. The high cost of this strategy\nwas seen in the steep GDP fall in the\nsecond quarter of 2020 \u2013 worse than\nany other G7 country. Yet, this nosedive\ndoesn\u2019t show the full picture. Not all industries were hit the same. It\u2019s obvious\nhow the hospitality industry was going\nto be dealt a more damaging hand by the\nrestriction due to the very nature of their\nwork but the government\u2019s poor oversite\nwas the nail to the coffin for many food\nbusinesses,forcingthemtocloseupshop\nor stop serving in the UK.\nIn late March, Boris Johnson addressed the nation and embedded into\nourcollectiveconsciousnessthecostume\nchanging slogan while mandating the\nclosure of all non-essential shops \u2013 the\nbeginning of lockdown. Yet, before this\nspeech, he had already been addressing\nthenation,attemptingtosoothethepeo-ple of their fears and give the direction\nthe so dearly sought. In these addresses,\nhe struck the first blow. He ever so politely encouraged that people stay away\nfrom pubs and restaurants yet not instructing the businesses to close. Restaurants were put in their first uncomfortable situation. Overnight their clientele\nplummeted. Keeping their door open\nputthematastarkloss.Yet,becausethey\nwould be closing their door of their own\nvolition, they wouldn\u2019t be able to collect\nany insurance money to allow them to\npay the fixed costs that\nwould be pilling on no\nmatter their serving\nstatus.\nRestaurants did\nwhat they could to\nmitigate for this before the lockdown\nstarted and some inventive projects and\nnew normals were\nborn that are showing\nstaying power even as\nrestrictions ease. They assured their customers that they would be taking all the\nprecautions they could while handling\nfood. It\u2019s common to put one\u2019s life in\ntheir hands in mitigating for allergies\nafter all. Quickly, you saw servers wearing mask and forcing people to use hand\nsanitiser before it became cool. Still the\nnumbers were dwindling.\nOnce lockdown hit, they also found\nsome inventive ways to build commu-nity, sharing recipes on Instagram and\nFacebook live. Restaurants and food\nstalls even found a way to bring your favourite dishes home with you outside of\ndelivery. Meal kits became the food fad\nof lockdown. At a click of a button, you\ncould have the restaurant quality ingredients from the places you were craving\ndelivered to your door to make with\nyour family once you became tired of\nbanana bread. You quickly become a star\nchef (with the help of some very thorough instructions) to wow\nyour family or entertain\nthe household after\nthe third New\nGirl binge by\ntrying to\nmake sense\nof the instruction\ntogether and\nall become line\nc o o k s\ntrying to\nmeet the\ndemands of\nthe dinner time\nrush.\nAt this point,\nthings weren\u2019t ideal, but\nthey were getting there.\nThose that made I out of the\nother side of this trial by fire were coming back stronger\nthan ever. Places were\nopening for delivery\nand were able to diversify their audience\nwhile spreading their\nreach. And it looked\nlike things were really\nchanging for the better\nonce the Eat Out To Help Out Scheme\nwas introduced. It sounded too good to\nbe true. Half off all eat in meals up to a\n\u00a310 off per person. No voucher needed.\nAsmanytimesasyouwantedfromMonday to Wednesday all\nthrough August. All\nthe restaurant had\nto so was sign up for\nthe scheme and they\ncould claim back\nthe discount from\nthe government\nso it could be used\non conjunction\nwith any deals they\nwould be running\nthemselves on those\nday. Suddenly they could entice people\nto restaurants by offering them whole\nrestaurant meals for little over the price\nof a Tesco meal deal. Everybody hopped\non this wave. Even the bougiest restaurants in town like Novikov\nwere getting involved\nbecause they had\nnothing to lose.\nOr so they\nthought.\nIn real-ity. the\nt i m e\nframe of\nM o n -day to\nWednesday of\nthe deal\nmeant that\ne v e r y o n e\nwould pack\nthemselves like\nsocially distanced\nsardines to any restaurant that would take them. After\nso long of people being out of work this\nwas a logistical nightmare for owners.\nRestaurants aren\u2019t just about the food\nbut also the service and if that faltered,\ntheir reputations would take a hit. They\nknew so many were using the scheme as\na way to try out new restaurants. They\nneed they had to ensure retention. In\norder to maintain quality, restaurants\nhad to put more people on their payroll\nand work them to the bone to come out\nthe other side of those three days a week.\nYet they also had the problem of ghost\ntowns for the rest of the week, now with\ntoo much staff and nothing to do with\nthem. Outside of the scheme days, restaurant floors were so barren, you could\nsee a tumbleweed rolling by if you\nsquinted. This was not sustainable\nbusiness.\nA deal like EOTHO also meant\nthat the perceived\nvalue of restaurant\nfood fell in the\npublic view. Let\u2019s\nbe real, lockdown\nhas taught us that\nare cooking skills\naren\u2019t what we\nmay hype them up to be when left with\nno other options. At a restaurant, you\npay for the experience, ease and quality.\nBut with EOTHO, the line of thought\nquickly became why would someone pay\nfull price for a meal at a restaurant when\nyou know it can be gotten for \u00a310 less.\nMany restaurants caved to this pressure.\nFearing that their sales would plummet\ndue to people not wanting to fork up the\nextra cash for something they were getting half off just a day ago, they extended eat out to help out into September.\nSome again in October. And this was\nall without Rishi\u2019s big pot of unlimited\nmoney but rather this already struggling\nbusinesses taking it on the chin themselves and paying the \u00a310 out of pocket\nfor each diner. Some just couldn\u2019t handle the heat. Even some world famous\nrestaurants like Dominique Ansel Bakery had to close up shop after August because they knew that they couldn\u2019t keep\ndoing business without the help of the\nscheme. No one was safe.\nYes, this scheme helped restaurants,\nbut it wasn\u2019t just for their benefit or\nelse the deal wouldn\u2019t have only applied\nto eating in. If take away was included,\nrestaurants would not have to put their\nstaff at risk to ensure they made a profit.\nThe deal could have had more days. They\ncould have even This was about getting\npeople outside of their house where they\nwould be using public transport, shopping and stimulating other sectors of the\neconomy that were affected by everyone\nbeing shut in. So all the problems for the\nrestaurants were acceptable if it meant\nthat everyone else was getting this boost,\nleaving restaurants to pick up the pieces\nthemselves once again.\nHow the UK let the Restaurant Industry Down\nPhoto credits: Thought catalogue\nZahraAbiola\nFoodEditor\nTHIS WAS A\nLOGISTICAL\nNIGHTMARE FOR\nOWNERS\n\u201c\nEAT OUT TO HELP\nOUT WASN\u2019T THE\nGOLDEN GOOSE\nMANY EXPECTED\n\u201c\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFOOD\nFOOD\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n44\n\n"

Light at\nthis wavelength was notably lacking, creating what\nis called an \u2018absorption line\u2019 in\nthe spectrum. This wavelength\ncorresponds to a specific transition in phosphine - the fact\nthat the absorption line\nwas at this wavelength\nindicated that there\ncould be phosphine\nin the atmosphere,\nabsorbing those photons to gain energy, taking\nthem away from the light spectrum that\nwould eventually reach the JCMT. Further confirmation of this absorption line\nwas sought with data collected at the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre\nArray (ALMA).\nThis data was astounding - any phosphine in the atmos-phereof Venusisexpected to react and\noxidise to become\nphosphates, particularly due to the\nenergy provided by\nthe ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,\nleading to a decay\nrate in the amount\nof phosphine. The\nfact that a detectable amount of\nphosphine exists\nin the atmosphere\nindicates that the decay rate is matched\nwith a production rate, i.e. an equilibrium has been reached, in this case at an\nabundance of 20ppb (parts per billion).\nThemystery,therefore,liesinthemechanismbehindthephos-phine production.\nThe authors\nof the landmark paper,\npublished in\nNature on September 14th, exhausted all known physical mechanisms for phosphine\np r o d u c t i o n .\nAround 75\nrelevant\nreactions\nu n d e r\nthousands of\nvarying conditions were looked at, including those\ninvolving volcanoes and lightning.\nNone of those reactions could explain\nthe abundance of phosphine detected\nin the atmosphere, leaving the researchers to conclude the phosphine \u201cmust be\nproduced by a process not previously\nconsidered plausible for Venusian con-ditions.

    "content": "The situation is now very bad. Hundreds of students are locked down\nin their flats. The questions on everyone\u2019s mind is could the students or the\nuniversity have put in place measures to\navoid this or is the fate of Murano one\nthat will be replicated in halls across the\ncountry including at Imperial.\nWith lectures, societies and sports all\nonline, Dan explained that it was difficult to get a sense of community. \u201cIt\u2019s either you sit in your room, and waste the\nfirst week of fresher\u2019s when you\u2019re meant\nto try to meet people and get some form\nof a social group going so that you\u2019re not\nalone during the first part of uni or you\njust don\u2019t get sick. So it really is no competition in people\u2019s eyes.\u201d Coupling this\nwith the fact that social distancing was\njust not possible in student halls, Dan\ntold Felix that everyone accepted they\nwould get the virus saying it was \u201cmutually agreed upon\u201d and \u201cunavoidable\u201d.\nSocial gatherings in halls which were\ndefinitely the big spreader had to happen as there was \u201cno other way to meet\npeople\u201d as online events did not work in\npractice.\nSome efforts were made by police to\nenforce social distancing, with about 30\nofficers patrolling the hall every night,\naccording to Dan, breaking up social\ngatherings. The lack of consistency in\nthe actions of these officers hinted that\nno official guidance had been given to\nthem with how to deal with the unique\nsituation presented to them by the halls\nof residence.\nAfter about a week, students in the\nhall started developing symptoms, these\nwould usually last just a few days and\nthey would feel better.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n14\nCOMMENT\nF\nor the past few months, thanks\nto Covid-19, students across the\ncountry have faced unprecedented changes to their educational\njourneys. Here at Imperial, we saw the introduction of the safety net policy and remote exams. A-Level students, on the other hand, had summer exams cancelled. I\nremember hearing this news and feeling slightly envious of what I, wrongly, assumed\nwould be a smooth ride to university for some. However, the challenge of fairly assigning grades to over 700,000 students for exams they didn\u2019t sit, meant a controversial grading system was introduced.\nThe difficulty of this challenge was made apparent when, on 13th\nAugust, 39% of\nstudents in England saw their A-Level results downgraded from their CAGs (Cen-tre Assessment Grades), which were their teacher\u2019s predictions. At the time, students\nwith downgraded results were given three main options; appeal their grades, re-sit in\nAutumn or accept their grades. However, the ensuing backlash was so intense that\njust 4 days after results day, the UK government took a U-turn and allowed CAGs\nto be used as final A-Level grades, if they were higher than those awarded by the\ngrading system.\nA guide published by Ofqual (The Office of Qualifications and Examinations\nRegulation) on results day, explained that the grading system was meant to moderate and standardise grades across England and maintain a grade distribution like\nthat of previous years in order to avoid grade inflation. Ofqual stated: \u201cWe had 2\nbroad aims: to make sure as many students as possible could get grades so they could\nmove on to the next stage of their lives and to do that in as fair a way as possible\u201d.\nAccording to Ofqual, without intervention, there would have been a 12.5% increase in A*-A grades since 2019. Upon introducing the grading algorithm; 78% of\nstudents scored A*-C, up 2.6% since 2019, and 27.6% of students scored A*-A, up\nonly 2.4% since 2019. A success in numbers it seemed but for 39% of students on\nresults day, their plans beyond A-Levels suddenly became very unclear.\nBelow are testimonies shared by some 1st\nyear students, exploring how A-Level results day went for them and how their admissions journey to Imperial was affected.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t meet my firm (Imperial) or my insurance\n(Manchester)\u2019\n\u201cThe IB used a similar algorithm to determine their grades which\ndowngraded me from a 766 (a level equivalent A*AA) to a 665 (AAB)\nwhich meant I didn\u2019t meet my firm (Imperial) or my insurance (Man-chester). Both eventually took me, however, my grades were never al-tered. The IB introduced a series of appeal processes which were applicable to few people. Then they said schools could appeal on the behalf\nof a candidate (which mine did for me), however , I still haven\u2019t heard\nback.\nThere is another process to re-mark our coursework however you\ncan only have one process at a time (either appeal or re-mark) which\nmeant while waiting for an appeal to come back I missed my re-mark\ndeadline. And I mean, yes, I\u2019m grateful because I\u2019m so much better\noff than some other IB students because they were turned away from\nuniversities after the A-Levels all got in from CAGs\u201d\n\u2018I can\u2019t describe to you the meltdown that I had\nthe morning of results day\u2019\n\u201cI was predicted A*AA and I needed AAA for Imperial and AAB\nfor my insurance. But I got A*A*C. So, I didn\u2019t get into any university.\nI can\u2019t describe to you the meltdown that I had the morning of results\nday. The main issue was that I needed to wait for an appeal for my math\nC grade, but as I didn\u2019t know when or if my grade would be changed,\nI couldn\u2019t take any places through clearing. They just kept filling up\nwhich was horrible because you wake up and see half the places than\nthere were originally only 24 hours prior.\nIn the end when there was the U-turn, I thought everything finally\nfixed itself and I\u2019d be able to go to university because I got my grades.\nHowever, I got told after I celebrated that I wasn\u2019t guaranteed entry\nand had to wait another 2 weeks to finally find out if I\u2019d go to university at all. I made plans for what to do if I don\u2019t go to university. My\nbig fear was the Brexit situation and the massive fee hike from 9k to\n25k which I couldn\u2019t afford. I can\u2019t tell you how horrible I felt for the\nwhole of August\u201d\n\u2018I feel like coming to Imperial, I need to prove\nto myself and the university, that I deserve to be\nthere\u2019\n\u201cI felt like I had no idea what to expect because I was being assigned\na grade rather than sort of knowing how well I\u2019d done in an exam. I\nneeded AAA to get into my course at Imperial, but I was mainly worried that I wouldn\u2019t get my A in math. My results loaded first, and I\nwas so happy that I\u2019d got A*A*A (A in maths) so I knew I\u2019d made my\noffer. Although I was happy, I did kind of feel a bit of imposter syn-drome, like I hadn\u2019t really earned those grades. After the U-turn my\nresults went up to 3A*s which anyone would be over the moon with,\nbut I just don\u2019t really see them as my own grades.\nI feel like coming to Imperial, I need to prove to myself and the uni-versity, that I deserve to be there, and I deserve my grades. I know that\na lot of people didn\u2019t make their offers, so I almost feel like I need to\nwork harder so that I know they didn\u2019t lose their places for someone\nwho doesn\u2019t deserve it!\u201d\nFrom A-Level results day to\nImperial\nKhamaGunde\nCommentEditor\n1st year students share how a controversial grading system affected their journey to Imperial\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\nNEWS\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHundreds of academics and researchers at Imperial College\nLondon have signed an open letter addressed to the College\u2019s senior leadership team calling for the repealing of\na new application fee for taught postgraduate courses. Signatories accuse\nthe College of \u201cfinancial gatekeeping\u201d\nand claim that the introduction of the\n\u00a380 fee will \u201cact as a direct barrier for\nunderprivileged students\u201d. The move\ncomes just weeks after the University\nof Oxford resolved to scrap their postgraduate application fees, which had\nbeen in place since 2007, with the congregation there specifically citing \u201cthe\nundermining of diversity efforts\u201d and\n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d.\nMany are surprised by the timing\nof the decision, especially given Imperial\u2019s specific context. According to\nthe most recent Times Good University Guide, Imperial ranks 5th lowest\nin the country for social inclusion,\nwith a particularly low percentage of\nstate-school-educated students. The\nintroduction of the fee puts Imperial squarely in the minority of Russell\nGroup institutions \u2013 although such\nfees are more common in London. The\nopen letter also stresses that the decision is \u201cimportant to consider in light\nof the recent work by the college to improve equality, specifically in response\nto the #BlackLivesMatter movement\u201d,\nnoting the \u201cco-correlation of socioeconomic class\nand ethnicity,\nand associated disadvantage\u201d.\nIn an interview with Felix earlier this\nweek, Profs\nIan Walmsley\nand Emma\nMcCoy of the\nsenior leadership team explained the\nreasoning behind the implementation\nof the fee, saying that \u201cappropriate\u201d\nmanagement of postgraduate applications is a \u201cconsiderable cost\u201d. They\nmaintain that the measure won\u2019t discourage anyone from applying, with\nProf Walmsley saying that \u201cwe have\nfunds which we can use as waivers if\npeople aren\u2019t able to cover the fee.\nWe think\nt h a t\nt h a t\nw i l l\nm i t -i g a t e\nthe diff i c u lty\u201d. Prof\nMcCoy\na d ded that\nfunding\navailability should\nstretch to\nany applicant \u201cwho\nmeets our\ncriteria for hardship. I don\u2019t think this\nis about the College profiteering\u201d.\nSome members of academic staff\ndisagree. Dr Dave Clements, deputy director of Physics MSc programs,\nshared his \u201cdistress\u201d over the decision.\n\u201cThis will be a heavy burden for disadvantaged students. Even with waivers,\nthese students will still be disadvantaged \u2013 they will have to go through\nthe extra process of applying, which\nwill further delay their application,\nand they could miss\ntheir place on high demand courses\u201d. One of\nthe authors of the open\nletter, Dr Ben Britton,\nexpressed surprise over\nthe timing of the move,\nparticularly in light of\nthe University of Oxford\u2019s recent resolution\nto abolish their fee and\nthe COVID-19 pan-demic, saying \u201cCOVID restricts access\nto universities\u2026 When there is an imminent recession, education is turned\nto, and immediately we\u2019re putting up\na financial barrier to people even applying\u201d.\nProf Chris Jackson, another of the\nauthors, described what he thought\nthe two-fold impact may be: \u201cOne part\nof it is inward-looking; I think a lot of\nstaff and students will find it hard to\ntrust Imperial when they make statements about BLM, or widening partic-ipation. And another part is to do with\nthe external reputation, and impact\non people applying\u201d. He added that\nthe College may miss out on \u201chuge\namounts of intellect and character\u201d\nfrom dissuaded applicants.\nIt\u2019s not just staff who oppose the\nmeasure: along with the academic signatories of the open letter are many\nstudents and alumni. Among them is\nBen Fernando, who led the successful\ncampaign at Oxford earlier this year\nand has organised a petition for Imperial alumni to voice opposition to the\nCollege\u2019s move. He said \u201cit\u2019s incredibly sad that Imperial have taken this\ndecision at a time when we should be\nreaffirming our commitment to equality and inclusion within the college. I\nhope fellow alumni will stand together\non this issue and make clear that it\u2019s\nnot OK.\u201d\nThe move has also called into question the transparency of the College\u2019s\ndecision-making processes. Dr Britton says that he first heard about the\nfee in a tweet of a colleague mere days\nbefore its introduction, and Prof Jackson recalls speaking to \u201cpassionate\npeople at Imperial [involved in] widening participation\u201d who were \u201ccompletely blindsided\u201d by the decision: \u201cit\nclearly hadn\u2019t been discussed as widely\nas it should have been\u201d. The final decision was made at President\u2019s Board,\nfor which minutes are not made readily available and whose process is described as \u201copaque\u201d.\nThe College hopes to prove these\nfears unfounded, with the official website promising that the waiver application process will be \u201cswift and simple\u201d\nand a pledging that it will \u201cmonitor the\nimpact closely over the coming year\u201d.\nCollege charges postgrads to apply\n\u2018Financial gatekeeping\u2019 say academics\nNick Manrique News reporter\nIMPERIAL RANKS\n5TH LOWEST IN\nTHE COUNTRY\nFOR SOCIAL\nINCLUSION\n\u201c\npeople aren\u2019t able to cover the fee.\nWe think\nw i l l\nm i t -i g a t e\nthe diff i c u lty\u201d.

    "content": "When it comes to finance, relevant university courses tend to\nbe more quantitative than qualitative.\nStudents hoping to work in financial\nservices are required to develop some\nprofessional experience through exposure to the workplace, most importantly\ninternships to build interpersonal skills\nas necessary. A job in financial services\ncannot be dissected to a set of specifics \u2013\nand yet however, there are a few popular\ncareers at an entry-level in the industry.\nThese could be suggested to be accounting & advisory, investment banking,\noperations, compliance and the booming FinTech for which London is widely\nconsidered a quintessential hub. The careers are made available at firms split up\ninto two sides of finance \u2013 buy-side and\nsell-side.\nWithin the financial market, buy-side\nrefers to the side that buys and invests\nsignificant portions of securities in order to carry out portfolio management.\nGiven that buy-side is revolved around\npurchasing huge chunks of securities at a\ntime, the top tier managers tend to own\nhold an extensive deal of market power\nin the industry at hand.\nThe sell-side, in fact, has far more opportunities for aspiring young people\nentering the workforce armed with a degree in finance, or even STEM and liberal arts which have also well prepared students to break into finance, as we have\nwitnessed in the past decade. This side\nis opposite of the buy-side given that it\ndeals with the issuing, selling and trading of securities to the capital markets.\nPopular sell-side firms include Citibank\nand Goldman Sachs, the latter of which\nhas led the \u2018sell-side empowers the buyside\u2019 movement in recent years. However, what truly matters is the institutions\nallowing for integration of all trade cycle parts, so these terms are expected to\ndwindle in significance over time. How\nabout the buy-side competitors?\nStill, there are a number of firms\nwhich dominate buy-side activities in\nthe financial services industry and these\ntend to be leading exchange-traded fund\nand mutual fund managers, including\nVanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock, all\nof which have unsurprisingly bright\noutlooks even through this challenging\nperiod, backed by unwavering optimism\nrevolving around asset management.\nMany of such investment management firms heavily depend risk management teams that lead protective efforts\nvia both bottom-up and top-down strategies which allow for the identification\nof the 2 main categories of risk which\nare enterprise and fiduciary. From these,\nmany entry level careers including financial modelling and quantitative analytics\nare available for graduates.\nIn addition to carrying out quantitative analysis to support a firm in managing its fiduciary and enterprise risks, risk\nmanagement teams ensure that portfolio risks are consistent across man-dates, reflect current investment themes\nwithin its strategies, and comply with\nclient-specific risk guidelines. Developing analytics and standards for risk and\nperformance measurement has become\nespecially paramount in recent years so\nthere has been a surge in demand jobs\nrelated to this.\nDuring your time at university, an\ninternship opportunity would certainly\nbroaden your horizons and potentially propel you into your dream job in\nfinancial services. An insightful experience when handled correctly could\nset you up for success after graduation.\nSome expectations to have going into a\nfinance internship are things that students would be better off brainstorming\nwhen making applications. This way, interviewers will have an improved chance\nof seeing sincerity and passion during\nconversations.\nWhen you spend a summer at some\nfirm in the relevant industry, you would\nbe applying the more technical skills\nlearnt and developed at university, all\nwhilst honing those essential soft skills\nto professionalism. Naturally, the internship will be centred around you\nbettering the way to handle professional\nduties such as analysis and team discus-sions. You will, however, also be spending lots of time trying to pick things\nup as there will be a very steep learning\ncurve going in so making sure to consistently demonstrate eagerness to learn\nnew concepts and ask relevant questions\nare imperative to apply and further increase knowledge.\nLonger period internships are typically called industry placements which\nstudents sometimes do if their university course permits it, thereby allowing for\nthese to be treated as credit for completion of the degree. These placements are\nan optimal way to develop skills in the\nprofessional environment, having that\nextended characteristic. In particular,\nyour employability will shoot up and\nyou will obtain an international perspec-tive. However, internships tend to be\nexclusive to those in their penultimate\nyear of study. What if you still want to\nget ahead early in a cut-throat industry?\nSpring Weeks are available for students going into their penultimate year,\nand are usually taken placement before\nSummer Term at university. The availability of such placements has permeated\nthroughout the industry in the past couple of years, allowing for firms to identify an early batch of students. Thus, the\nprogram is treated as a pipeline for summer internship programs and in turn,\nfor full-time roles. Even without intern\nto full-time conversion, you would have\nstill enhanced networking skills and\nconnected with people on LinkedIn so\nthat it is possible to stay in touch with\nthose who have similar career interests.\nFierce competitiveness in financial\nservices at an entry-level is without\ndoubt the norm in 2020 and with virus concerns and an expected economic\nbubble burst, this does not seem to be\nstagnating as we move further into the\ndecade. With the right amount of ambition and resilience, incoming university\ngraduates can face adversity and optimistically strive for an acceptable career.\nA guide to breaking into finance\nGeoff Sang Investment editor\nWelcome to financial services.

What\u2019s also scary is how institutions believe it\u2019s enough to acknowledge Black history for one month of the\nyear, and ignore them for the rest (in the\nUS, Black History Month is celebrated\nin February - the shortest month of the\nyear).\nIt\u2019s not enough. But it\u2019s a start.\nThis month is a time for reflection.\nNot only is it an opportunity to celebrate Black contributions to society in\nhistory, film, art, sports and\u2026 politics,\nit\u2019s also an opportunity to develop our\nunderstanding of African & Caribbean\nculture. Black British history is important because it matters to everyone - it\u2019s\na crucial part of this country\u2019s story. The\nWindrush generation - people arriving\nin the UK between 1948 and 1971 from\nCaribbean countries - were transported\non the ship HMT Empire Windrush as\nthe British Empire were filling shortages in the labour market due to WWII.\nBlack people fought for this nation, during and after the war. The mass migration and following events led to major\nculturalshifts,buildingthecommunities\nwe have today (although there\u2019s always\nroom for improvement).\nWe\u2019re all too aware of America\u2019s Black\nhistory regarding the slave trade, but\nBlack history is much more than just\nthat. Few have heard about how the\nEthiopian Krar Harp is the earliest form\nof guitar, or how Liberia was founded as\na settlement for free Black people, believing they would face better chances\nfor freedom and prosperity there than in\nthe United States.\nThere\u2019sBlackhistorywhenitcomesto\nSTEM too: Otis Boykin, the Black man\nwhoimprovedpacemakercircuitry;how\nyou\u2019re five times more likely to die during pregnancy if you\u2019re a Black woman,\nand Henrietta Lacks, whose \u2018immortal\u2019\ncells have been used at the forefront of\nvirus, cancer and radiation research (the\nethics of obtaining these cell samples are\nvery questionable).\nIt\u2019s important - arguably now more\nthanever-totalkabouttheseBlackpeo-ple and the system that was against them\nin the past and the system against us in\nthe present.\nOctober comes to you with an opportunity to both learn and remember.\nThereflections,research,support&conversations don\u2019t need to end on the 1st\nNovember- this month just gives you a\nnudge to get started.\nPlease visit the Union website for upcoming Black History Month events: https://\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/campaigns/black-histo-ry-month-2020\nBlack History Month is here!\nLiberation Officer Deborah Adegoke highlights the importance of Black History Month\nDeborahAdegoke\nBMEOfficer*\nPeople March at the Black Lives Matter Protest in Washington DC 6/6/2020\nPhoto credits: Unsplash - Clay Banks\nCredits: Oladimeji Odunsi\nThis month and every other month we must fight against racist injust\n\n"

Kept\nout of sight and out of mind. Yet, these\nnylons play a most pivotal role in our\neveryday lives. Without socks how\ncould we brave the world? How could\nwe escape the chilly floors underfoot\nor the rough innards of our shoes?\nBereft of socks we\u2019d be as feeble as\na wee babe, still coddled by a mother\u2019s embrace. We were born without\nthem, but we shouldn\u2019t have to live\nlike that! I myself was granted the\ngift of covering myself with these\nfeet coverings mere moments after my birth.

I pray you\u2019ve\nmanaged to understand\nthe underlying importance and\nvalue of socks. Not to mention the\narray of designs, we really are spoilt for\nchoice.

    "content": "Since Covid first made its appearance earlier in 2020, most of us\nhave seen far fewer people than we\u2019re\nused to. Families have been at home for\nmonths. If you\u2019re a student, you may\nhave been in your dorm room with your\nmates.\nBut as humans, we\u2019re sociable crea-tures. Even introverts need some social-isation, and many of us are desperate to\nget out of the house and do something\n(anything) with friends. If you\u2019re wondering what activity would be fun, chal-lenging, and socially distanced enough\nto be safe, why not try golf? Here\u2019s why\nit would be a great way for students to\nsocialise in the time of Covid.\nIf you\u2019re an avid golfer, you may have\nbeen playing at home or in your dorm\nroom throughout lockdown. But if you\nthink about it, golf is the perfect social\ndistancing sport. There\u2019s no high-fiving\nand bum-slapping like there is in other\nsports. It\u2019s known as the gentlemen\u2019s\ngame (or gentlewomen\u2019s) and it\u2019s much\nmore chilled with the physical contact.\nThat\u2019s not to say there are no happy\ncongratulations when one of you sinks\na tough putt or gets an elusive hole-in-one. They\u2019re just more\nlike an appreciative\nnod than a raucous\nteam hug.\nGolf is a leisurely\nsport that promotes\nhealth and fitness,\ngets you out in the\nfresh air, and allows\nyou to do something enjoyable\nwith a group of people whose company you like. To add to\nthat, the relaxed nature of golf makes it\none of the best sports to do with a mask\non, if you feel the need for an extra layer\nof protection.\nDespite the fact that golf is a one-man game, it\u2019s still a team sport in other\nways. If you have a caddy, there\u2019s already\na loyal partner in your game. If not,\nyou\u2019ll still be walking the course with\nsome good friends. Some competition\nis part of the experience, but if you\u2019re\nplaying a friendly game, you\u2019ll most\nlikely be cheering each other on rather\nthan plotting to\nthrow your bestie\u2019s game off.\nThen there\u2019s the\n19th hole - the\nchance to catch\nup afterwards and\nchat about the\ngame,theday,and\nwhatever else you\ndidn\u2019t get round\nto talking about\non the course. The 19th hole doesn\u2019t\nhave to be in a bar or restaurant, either.\nIf you can\u2019t have a pint in the clubhouse\nafter a game due to Covid restrictions,\nyou can have a Coke and a sandwich on\na picnic blanket or someone\u2019s tailgate\nbefore heading home.\nAre you a beginner who still needs\nto learn the difference between a driver\nand a putter? Don\u2019t let that put you off\ngetting out on the golf course. Here\u2019s\nanother perfect opportunity to social-ise - learn from someone whose skill\nlevel is greater than yours. If you\u2019re an\nadvanced player, why not teach one\nof your friends the ins and outs of the\ngame? Golf doesn\u2019t only have to be a so-cialising opportunity for those who\u2019ve\nplayed before or have similar abilities.\nWhy not get a bunch of friends together and learn or teach your way through\na game? It\u2019s still getting out in the fresh\nair, doing some exercise, and getting\nsome valuable social time together.\nGolf is a super way for students to get\nout of their dorm room and socialise\nwith some friends they haven\u2019t seen in\na while. It\u2019s the perfect social distancing\nsport, while improving health, keeping\nthe brain sharp, and being just good fun\nall at the same time.\nIf you want to get involved with the\nclub, you can reach them at golf.club@\nimperial.ac.uk\n1 Brit\u2019s fanny pack second-rate by\ngraduate angle uncovered (6)\n4 Commercial break without anchor (6)\n8 Crash plough into heath by mistake at\nend of day (3,3,3)\n10 Weep over European losing\nconsciousness (3)\n11 When in Rome, how to get on with\ncrazy dudes full of vim and vino?

What we concluded overall, is that we are having sex and there is\nno right or wrong way to do it, except for maybe the small minority of you who put feet\nstuff as a kink. When it comes to sexual health whether it be STIs or harassm-ent, there is still some way to go with bringing these issues to light amongst\nour community.

Also, with everyone else\ngetting moved up after the U-turn, my grades looked even lower as\nmine didn\u2019t move. My teachers told me that they wanted to play it safe,\nbut obviously overall it didn\u2019t work. I went from 3A*s to 3As\u201d\n\u2018I got exactly what I needed\u2019\n\u201cI was actually quite lucky in the sense that I got exactly what I needed and what I thought I deserved the first time. As I\u2019d worked consistently hard since year 12, I feel my mocks (which were past papers) were\na good representation (A*A*A in math, physics and chemistry respec-tively). When they were upgraded (from A to A* in chemistry) I felt\nkind of guilty since I knew I didn\u2019t need it or would\u2019ve achieved the\nhigher grade, although I\u2019m obviously happy that so many people finally\ngot what they deserved. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bit of imposter syndrome\nsneaking in. Although it helps knowing that of course I must have done\nwell enough on the selection day and in my personal statement to still\nbe selected.\nMost of my friends also had the grades they needed. I assume it\u2019s because our school has a history of doing well. A couple of my friends\ndidn\u2019tgetwhattheyshouldhavesoarere-sittingexams.However,since\nthey are both taking gap years it hasn\u2019t affected their university plans.\nIt\u2019d be much worse if they hadn\u2019t planned to take gap years. It\u2019s great\nthat the government is letting people take actual exams but it\u2019s just too\nlate in the year for people who were planning to go to university since\nthat\u2019ll set them back a whole year\u201d\n\u2018I think my situation was quite rare\u2019\n\u201cI had an offer from Imperial to study Medicine, and the grades I\nneeded were A*AA with the A* in biology or chemistry specifically. I\u2019d\nbeen predicted A*A*A in biology, math and chemistry respectively.\nI\u2019d been told for the past two years, by my teachers, that my predicted\ngrades were what I would get, and my school has a reputation for making accurate predictions, so I knew that I was somewhat deserving of\nthose grades.\nOn results day, I opened my emails to see I was given 3A\u2019s and I was\nso shocked. I wasn\u2019t expecting it. Honestly, I cried my eyes out because\nImperial is my dream university; I\u2019d been aiming for it for two years. I\nknew it was where I wanted to go, I knew it was where I would fit in.\nBut in that moment, I also knew I didn\u2019t meet my offer. I thought Imperial would never be lenient and prepared myself for rejection.\nUCAS Track had crashed for 40 minutes but when it finally worked\nand I opened the page, I saw that I was accepted by both my firm\n(Imperial) and my insurance (KCL). Both let me in despite the fact I\nhadn\u2019t met my offers. My confirmation from Imperial meant the world\nto me so I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, I think my situation was quite\nrare since none of my friends who applied to Imperial and missed their\ngrades got in on results day.\nI think I was accepted because Imperial had said before results day\nthat they would look at the grades and even if you had missed your of-fer, they would look at your application holistically e.g. looking at your\ninterview score. Then they would make a judgement based on the rest\nof your application to see whether they would still let you come in. So, I\nthink it was my interview score that got me in, I think I did might have\ndone well on my interview.\nIn the end everyone got their CAGs, but when I received mine it\nturned out that my teachers had submitted A*AA for me. Even though\nthey had consistently told me I could achieve A*A*A and I had felt really supported by them. As frustrating as that was, I got the A* in the end\nand it was nice to have some recognition for my hard work over the past\n2 years, plus I\u2019ve now officially met my offer conditions.\nSomepeoplehadtowaitagesafterbeingdowngradedtoknowifthey\ngot in, so they thought they were rejected, then got accepted through\nCAGs, then had accommodation issues. Compared to others, I feel\nlucky and grateful for how things worked out for me. But I think it was\na difficult and unfair situation for most of us.\nAlso, some schools were very strict with predicted grades, like mine.\nI went to a grammar school which was very stingy with top grades and\nthey didn\u2019t give loads of pupils A*\u2019s even if they were deserving of it. A\nlot of my friends were high achievers but didn\u2019t get A*\u2019s or A\u2019s from the\nteachers, so it felt very unfair. Whereas I know for all my private school\nfriends, they got upgraded. So, the whole system was unfair because\nsome schools were upgrading, and others were downgrading.\nI understand that it was a challenging task for the government to do,\nbut the way they went about it didn\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d\nCredits: Nicolas Geiseler-Toran\n\n"

And in light of recent events, we\nareinneedofsomelaughtermoresothanever.Wheth-er you need something to remind you of what life used\nto be when you could visit your friend(s), a reason to\nprocrastinate revision, or simply some background\nnoise to keep the loneliness at bay while scrolling the\ninternet, I present the battle of the sit-coms!\nAs a home student, I have a huge amount of pride\nfor the great British telly, and while we have our own\ngreat sitcoms (read: Outnumbered, The Office UK,\nThe Inbetweeners and Plebs), our expertise seems to lie\nmore in the realms of drama. Don\u2019t get me wrong, drama series are great, but while the world is a dystopian\nhorror reality, light and cheerful sitcoms are the way to\ngo. More specifically, American sitcoms. Their endless\nseasons with more than 8 episodes, each make these\nshows perfect for a long-term binging commitment.\nBut which one should you devote so, so many hours of\nyour life to? Fear not, for I have the answer.\nBetween Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+,\nthere are countless series to binge, but for the sake of\ncrowning the best sitcom, let\u2019s consider the most popular four: Brooklyn Nine Nine, Friends, How I Met\nYour Mother and The Office US. Disclaimer: I have\nwatched all these shows at least twice through each, so\nI feel pretty well informed, but these are just my opinions trying to help you pick your next binging obses-sion, so don\u2019t at me.\nFirstly, let\u2019s talk about Friends. This is probably one\nof the most infamous American sitcoms ever. With 10\nseasons and a total of 236 episodes, this will take over\n3 \u00bc days to binge. Set predominately in 90s, this show\nis great for reminiscing a simpler time of landlines and\nmomjeans,andforthoseintheearthscience,Ross\u2019palaeontology lectures count as revision, right? Friends is\none of the best American sitcoms, however, taking it\nout of its contemporary context, some characters views\nbe quite problematic. Despite the occasional fat-sham-ing and homophobia, the show is light-hearted and\nnot too rough on your brain. Each episode is standalone and requires next to no concentration to enjoy.\nThe characters are relatable which can be a downside if\nyou get emotionally invested so take this as a warning:\nwhilestuckathomeinlockdown,youwillfindyourself\nliving vicariously because though your actual friends\nmay not be able to, Friends will be there for you.\nNext there\u2019s How I Met Your Mother. This is another hefty series with 9 seasons and 206 episodes to get\nstuck into, which will take you just short of 3 days to\ncomplete. The show follows Ted Mosby telling his children the story of how he met their mother (obviously),\nand his life with his friends Robin, Marshall, Lily and\nBarney. These characters, though great, are less relata-ble and a bit more annoying. The episodes follow the\ngeneral chronology of how Ted met Mrs Mosby, but\nagain, each episode is quite standalone, perfect for\nwhen you\u2019ve fallen asleep in front of the telly. HIMYM\nis a lot more about the journey than the destination.\nWithout giving anything away, when you FINALLY\nget to the end, it\u2019s somewhat of a cop out. You\u2019ve been\non this whole roundabout for hours and hours, following all the characters\u2019 lives, for not much of a payoff.\nThat\u2019s not to say each episode individually isn\u2019t enjoya-ble, but if you\u2019re watching it to find out who the mother is - don\u2019t, just google it instead.\nThen there\u2019s The Office US. Based on the Ricky Gervais show in the UK of the same name (but better), the\nmockumentary follows the workers at Dunder Mifflin\nPaperCompany.Anotherserieswith9seasonsand201\nepisodes means it will keep you busy for a while or a\nhardcore 67 hours. The characters are a lovable band\nof misfits, often winding each other up in the office,\nthough due to the paper company setting, the episodes\ncan have a bit of monotony which can make it difficult\nto consume in large quantities. Having said that, it is\ngreat way to turn your brain off and relax after a hard\ndays work\u2026 or not.\nFinally, there\u2019s Brooklyn Nine Nine, the youngest of\nthe series and the only one still making new episodes.\nTherearecurrently7seasonsandatotalof143episodes\nwhich gives it a reasonable viewing time of just under\n2 days. From the writers that gave you Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine Nine follows the detectives in\nthe 99th Precinct of the NYPD. The characters are the\nmost diverse group of protagonists out of any sitcom,\nallowing the show to delicately address serious issues\nsuch as homophobia, sexual assault and racism, in such\na way it doesn\u2019t compromise the comedy of the show or\nbecome \u2018preachy\u2019. Despite being yet another workplace\nsitcom, each episode follows a different case as well as\nthe long running relationships between the characters,\ngiving it a more substantial plot and making it great to\nbinge or to watch casually during a break. This is another show of relatable characters, who are genuinely\nfunny so there needs to be another warning here about\ngetting too emotionally invested, but at least they\u2019re\nstill making more episodes so you don\u2019t have to feel\nthat empty void for too long after watching it.\nAll of these shows are fab, and everyone has their\nown favourite, but if I had to crown a winner (I don\u2019t\nhave to but I\u2019m going to anyway), it would have to\nbe Brooklyn Nine Nine. The police setting allows for\nloads of wild stories, the characters feel real and have\ntheir own strengths and flaws, making it more enjoyable all round to watch. The 99 work as a team and have\nagreatsenseofcommunitywhichwemaybemissingin\nour own lives at the moment. If you\u2019re in need of a pick\nme up, this is the show for you.\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n54\nThe worryingly warrow wustainability\nconcept of many \u2018Green\u2019 Companies\nThe main reason for green companies accepting large investments\nis to scale-up and sell in more markets\nacross the world. Yet, there is a strong\nconsensus for the incompatibility of\ncapitalist growth and sustainability. You\ncould say the same for globalisation and\nsustainability. According to the scholar,\nVandana Shiva, the development of the\nmarket can\u2019t solve the crisis as it creates\nit. Therefore, having goals such as dominating the global market show a lack of\ntrue care for the crises, we have put ourselves in. Instead of trying to dominate\nthe world market, a more sustainable\noption would be to help support local\ncollectives across the world and starting\nthese where there is already demand.\nMany green companies focus on environmental impact of production but\nevade the importance of social impact\nfor sustainability. For ex-ample, Oatly\u2019s\nsustainability\nreports\ndo not\naccount\nfor ex-ternalities\nof packaging post\nit\u2019s consumer\nusage, yet they\nclaim the \u2018climate\nfootprint from\nour production is\nvirtually non-existent\u2019. The packaging can\nbe \u2018easily recycled\u2019 with\nthe correct facilities, but\nthis puts the responsibility\nonto the consumer to recycle properly, which depends\non the local authorities having proper\nfacilities and practices.\nThere is a lack of advanced recycling\nservices across the globe and so a lot of\npackaging is not recycled and goes into\nlandfill; in 2018, 16% of Oatly\u2019s cartons\nwere recycled in the USA and 35% in\nthe UK. The dependence on recycling\nin this way is not a circular\nbusiness model, and the\nreliance on customers\nto recycle is not for-ward-thinking. Focusing\non recycling sustains\nand bolsters the disposable culture driving\necological collapse. Plus,\nmany authorities send\ntheir landfill abroad to\nMAPA (Most Affected\nPeople and Areas), places that were colonised\nand historically margin-alised in the globe. Due\nto a variety of factors,\none being structural\nadjustment policies,\noften these countries do not have the\nsame capacity to recycle or process the\nenormous amount of waste shipped to\nthem creating hazardous health risks\nfor communities and environmental\ninjustice.\nTaking the word \u2018sustainability\u2019 to\nsolely mean environmental footprint\nis a common but dangerous mistake to\nmake. If production is not fully circu-lar, it cannot be considered sustainable\nsince waste is a modern human creation.\nCeline Semaan, the founder of the\nSlow Factory, says that sustainability\nshouldn\u2019t just be about making cleaner\nproduction, it must be about reducing\nconsumption.\nA hotly debated topic within sustainability communities online is the\nsymbiosis of capitalism and sustainabili-ty. Marx\u2019s metabolic rift theory explains\nthat capitalism disturbs the metabolic\ninteraction between human bIeings\nand the planet on which they live, for\nexample, large-scale industry impoverishes workers and large-scale agriculture\ndeteriorates the soil. For this reason, his\nwritings describe the only lasting path\nto sustainability being the consideration\nof land as communal property. For-profit companies are required to act selfishly\nin the capitalist context so they cannot\nbe depended upon to \u2018save the world\u2019,\neven if they are \u2018green\u2019. Greening also\nonly focuses on one\naspect of\nsustainabil-ity, leaving\nout ethics,\nsocial justice\nand circular-ity.\nSince\ncapitalism is\ninherently\ndesigned to\ndestroy and\nextract from\nnature, there\nis no ethical\nconsumption under\ncapitalism,\nand some argue that reforming the\nsystem is not enough; instead we need\nre-design and re-construction. Therefore, green capitalism doesn\u2019t solve our\ncurrent situation of ecological and climate breakdown. Power and greed characterise our system, so even in a greener\ncontext, there is still profit being made\nthrough exploitation and injustices.\nIt is worrying to see companies like\nOatly claim that our future can be saved\nby sustainable business and that we can\ntrust green capitalist companies to be\nenough. The climate crisis is happening\nnow; people are being affected right\nnow, and these new flavours of capi-talism, be it green or vegan will stop it.\nGreen business models are often less\nharmful to the environment than traditional models, yet they are still rarely\nactually beneficial to the earth.\nThe ongoing dominance of individualism manifests itself in a focus upon\ngreen business and green growth. More\nradical changes and models should be\nadapted to reverse climate and stop\necological breakdown, such as shifting\nto a post-growth economic world with\na major scaling down of resource and\nenergy use in the Global North. Socio-economic relations will need to be\nradically transformed to heal the fissure\nbetween humans and nature. To release\nthe exploitative burden off MAPA, we\nneed collective shifting towards local\nfood sourcing, regenerative systems and\nland reparations to allow for recovery of\npillaged communities. In this way, the\nGlobal North may be able to re-learn\nthe finite extent of resources and reconnect with local methods of production\ndepending on the environmental condi-tions. Focusing on ecological growth instead of economic growth is needed for\nmore equitable well-being and health of\nall organisms.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nPhoto credits: Wikipedia/Oatly\nThis Week\u2019s Sustainability Inspiration\nMonami Miyamoto Sustainability Editor\nPodcast: The Sustainababble\nSustainababble is a fun, approachable and casual podcast run by Ol and Dave who babble on\nabout topical sustainability issues.

This marks the first time in\nhistory that two women have shared the\nprize.\nDuring her studies of a harmful\nbacteria known as Streptococcus pyogenes,\nwhich is responsible for infectious diseases such as tonsillitis and scarlet fever,\nCharpentier discovered that a previously unknown molecule called tracrRNA\nwas used in the bacteria\u2019s own immune\nsystem to disarm unknown viruses by\n\u201ccutting out\u201d sections of their DNA.\nCharpentier and Doudna then worked\ntogether to recreate and simplify these\nso-called \u201cgenetic scissors\u201d in a test tube.\nFinally, they reprogrammed the genetic\nscissors so that they could be controlled\nand used to cut out any DNA molecule,\nnot just those from viruses.\nWhen these DNA molecules are\ncut out, cells will try to fix the damage\ncaused, often disabling the gene in the\nprocess. This allows harmful genes to\nbe \u201cswitched off\u201d. Mutated DNA could\nalso be replaced with a healthy section\nof DNA to combat genetic diseases.\nGenome\nediting has\nbecome\nsomething\nof a controversial topic\nover the past\ndecade, with\nmany fearing\nthat it may\nlead to the\ncreation of\n\u201cdesigner\nbabies\u201d. Last\nyear, scientist\nHe Jiankui\nwas sentenced\nto three years in prison for creating genetically modified twin sisters using the\nCRISPR-Cas9 procedure, in an attempt\nto make them immune to HIV. Doudna\nhas herself expressed feelings of concern\nabout the use of the technology she has\ndeveloped, and, in a 2015 interview\nwith the New Yorker, even recounted\na dream in which she had to present\nher work on genome editing to Adolf\nHitler.\nThis is not the only controversy that\nsurrounds Wednesday\u2019s announcement.\nThe invention of the CRISPR technology has been the centre of an ongoing\nfive-year long patent battle between the\ngroups led by Charpentier and Doudna,\nand a group led by Feng Zhang who\npublished evidence that the CRISPR\nsystem could be used as a genome editor\njust 7 months after Charpentier and\nDoudna. A team led by biochemist\nVirginijus Siksnys also independently\ndeveloped CRISPR genome editing and\npublished their results around the same\ntime, and Siksnys was jointly awarded\nthe 2018 Kavli Prize with\nCharpentier and Doudna.\nDespite all this, the Nobel Committee for Chemistry clearly felt that there\nwere just two scientists who\nwere responsible for the\ndiscovery. Charpentier and\nDoudna have pioneered\na new technology that\nhas already transformed\nresearch in life sciences. The\npotential applications of\nthe CRISPR-Cas9 \u201cgenetic\nscissors\u201d seem limitless,\nfrom genetically engineered\nplants to the development\nof new cancer treatments. And as\nProfessor G\u00f6ran K. Hansson, Secretary\nGeneral of the Royal Swedish Academy\nof Sciences, noted at the start of the an-nouncement, \u201cit is important, and well\nworth the extra effort, to keep awarding\nthe most important discoveries and celebrating scientific progress, even under\nthese difficult times\u201d.\nLily Shepherd Science Writer\n4th\nwoman in history to\nbe awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Physics\nUCLA astrophysicist and 2020 Nobel laureate Andrea Ghez\nBiochemists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A.

    "content": "When did you first hear this song?\nDuring my first year of uni, would\u2019ve been Jan 2019. I\nwas introducing myself to the David Bowie discography and fell in love with this track straight away. The\ndramatic and cinematic storytelling, I fuck with\nit heavily.\nWhat initially drew you to the song?\nI was in the kitchen, not really paying atten-tion. The singing progresses from spoken to melodic to emotional, it really drew me in. Five\nminutes later I was already going back for\nseconds.\nIn a sentence or two, describe the song.\nIt introduces the concept of the album, that\nthe earth will cease to exist in five years due\nto lack of resources. At the time of its release the Cold War was in full swing.\nWhat about the performance do you love?\nBowie starts half singing half talking, kind of like Lou\nReed and the Velvet Underground. As it goes on, it becomes more emotional, he becomes more involved, climaxing when he screams and cries. Bowie actually cries\nat the end and it was all one take.\nHow often do you listen to the song?\nRarely.\nIs there a great lyric?\nWhen he speaks directly to the listener, making\nthem aware that the song is about them too. \u201cI\nthinkIsawyouinanice-creamparlour/Drink-ing milkshakes cold and long/ Smiling and\nwaving and looking so fine/ Don\u2019t think\nyou knew you were in this song\u201d.\nWhen do you listen to this song?\nAfter listening to a lot of popular music and I\u2019m tired of that bullshit, then I\ngo back to the classics.\nWhere do you listen to this song?\nBasically, anywhere where I know I won\u2019t be bothered\nfor about fifteen minutes, mostly just my room lying in\nbed.\nIs there another sense you associate strongly with\nthis song?\nBecause of the descriptive imagery I can taste ice cream\nor milkshakes on a nice sunny day.\nHow did this song affect your musical habits?\nItdidvalidatemyreasoningforwantingtoventureinto\nnew gernes of music.\nFinal Comments?\nYou should check out the conspiracy around this song\n(see below).\nWhile interviewing the lovely Imperialite Jakub\nHanczak about the song \u201cFive Years\u201d by David\nBowie I was introduced to a conspiracy theory. The theory has existed since 2007 and ties the legendary artists David Bowie and\nKanye West together, claiming\nthat Bowie predicted the coming\nof Kanye West.\nIt starts with Bowie\u2019s album\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.\nOn the album cover we see\nDavid Bowie posing under a sign\nthat reads \u201cK.WEST\u201d. Apparently, this was simply the sign of\na fur store in London, though I\nthink we all know it really means\n\u201cKanye West\u201d. Opening the\nalbum is the track \u201cFive Years\u201d,\nwhich tells that the world will\nrun out of resources and come to an end in just five\nyears. Later in the album, David Bowie tells of a \u201cStarman\u201d who comes to earth to save humanity. How long\nafter the release of the album was Kanye West born?\nFive years (and two days)!\nClearly a link has been established here. Though, it\u2019s not\nuntil around the time of David\nBowie\u2019s unfortunate passing that\nmore conspiracy grows. David\nBowie\u2019s final album Blackstar\ncontains the lyrics \u201cI\u2019m a Blackstar, I\u2019m a Blackstar, I\u2019m not a\ngangstar\u201d. People have tied this\nin as obviously Kanye West is\na \u201cblack star\u201d. Some may even\nconsider Kanye West as the\nbiggest \u201cstar\u201d. Additionally,\nwhen he emerged onto the scene\nin 2003, Kanye West positioned\nhis music as an alternative to the\npopular sub-genre gangster rap.\nPeople started drawing in\nclues from Kanye West\u2019s albums too. The third track\nof West\u2019s Yezus is \u201cI AM A GOD\u201d and respectively\nin David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar it\u2019s \u201cLazarus\u201d. The biblical\nfigure Lazarus was resurrected by Christ three days\nafter his entombment. Some have tied these \u201cclues\u201d\ntogether as a metaphor for Kanye West being David\nBowie\u2019s successor, being sure to resurrect/continue\ntheir collective musical genius.\nThe reamining parts of this conspiracy are even\nmore far fetched than the points presented already\nand most of this can be dismissed with one simple\nword \u2013 coincidence. Both artists have denied that any\nof this was intentional. Though, if you were some sort\nof ethereal musical being would you disclose it to the\ngeneral population?\nThe only question I have remaining is that if Kanye\nWest was David Bowie\u2019s successor, who will be Kanye\nWest\u2019s?\nPassing the Aux to Jakub Hanczak\nThe Bowie-West Conspiracy\nPhoto credits:\nFeature\nFeature\nEach week an Imperial student will be intereviewed about a song they love and want to share with Felix readers.

    "content": "On the surface, the Oatly boycott\nappears as though the action is simply to \u2018cancel\u2019 the company. However,\ndelving deeper into the conversations\nheld between those in sustainability\ncommunities online we see how people\nfeel like this boycott is to keep the\ncompany to account to their commitment for climate and social justice and\npromise \u2018to be a good company\u2019. Oatly\nclaims that they are the most ethical\nand environmentally friendly option\nof milk-type beverage. Therefore, these\ncustomers expected more from the\ncompany, but they would be willing to\nsupport Oatly again if they were to do a\nU-turn.\nOatly recently published their acceptance of investment from the private\nequity firm Blackstone, the part-owner\nof 2 Brazilian firms contributing to the\ndestruction of the Amazon rainforest,\nresponsible for the forced evictions\nof families after the 2008 economic\ncrisis and with a CEO donating to the\nTrump administration. The boycotters\nare not just against the acceptance of\nmoney from such a firm which profits\noff exploitation and injustice, but also\nthe fact that Oatly\u2019s customers will be\ncreating profit for Blackstone through\ngreen business. Plus, Blackstone is\nusing this investment as an opportunity to greenwash their company. Oatly\ncould have chosen a better investor considering their efforts on sustainability\nreporting and marketing, but they have\nbeen forthcoming on the possibilities\nthis investment gives them to grow and\nglobalise the business. So, should we\noat-drinkers boycott Oatly if we care so\nmuch for the future of the planet? We\nhere at Felix sustainability are not going\nto tell you what to do. This is something\nyou must figure out. Does Oatly align\nwith your values? Maybe you would like\nto learn more about green capitalism\nand sustainability before you make that\ndecision. Read our second page to learn.\nOat drinkers boycott Oatly\nFRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\nSUSTAINABILITY\n53\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBack in July, Oatly, the oat milk\ncompany that\u2019s been popping up in\nevery supermarket and coffee shop accepted a $200 million investment from\nBlackstone, one of the biggest private\nequity firms in the world. Soon after,\nthe climate activist @LessWasteLaura\nurged her twitter followers to boycott\nOatly. She discovered that Blackstone\nfunded a Brazilian infrastructure\nproject which involved deforesting the\nAmazon rainforest. Frustrated, Laura\nclaimed that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant my money going to the destruction of the planet\nand putting people\u2019s lives and land at\nrisk just so that I can have a creamy\ncoffee in the morning!\u201d. The twitter\nthread went viral, and suddenly, Oatly\nwas \u2018cancelled\u2019.\nIt\u2019s true that Oatly\u2019s goal is to \u2018deliver\nproducts that have maximum nutritional value and minimal environmental\nimpact\u2019. Accepting this investment\nseems like the last thing a plant-based,\nsustainable company should be doing.\nAfter all, aren\u2019t they putting money in\nthe pockets of the evil Blackstone that\u2019s\ndestroying our planet, one tree at a\ntime?\nWhat we must understand when\nwe read stories like this, is that there\u2019s\nalways a bigger picture when it comes to\nsustainability - it requires compromises.\nBy boycotting companies like Oatly, the\nonly thing we\u2019re doing\nis holding back the\nprogress of sustainable\nbusinesses.\nOatly could have\nfound a different investor with a clean track\nrecord. But unfortu-nately, most prominent\ninvestors are linked in\nsome way to projects that contribute\nto the destruction of our planet. It\nwould\u2019ve been an enormous challenge\nfor Oatly to find an investment size\nsufficient to reach their large-scale goals,\nwithout an initial trade-off.\nAccording to Oatly, the company\nneeded funding to meet its growing\nglobal demands. Using the money from\nBlackstone, as well as a $200 million\ngreen deal bank loan, they\u2019re planning\nto build more factories in Asia, Europe\nand the US. The result of this will be\nthat Oatly, a producer of the most\nenvironmentally friendly milk alter-native, will\nbe on more\nsupermarket\nshelves than\never. Oat\nmilk will be\naccessible\nto a broader\naudience,\nand every\npint of dairy\nmilk that is\nreplaced with oat milk is a step towards\na smaller impact on our climate. Isn\u2019t\nthis what we want?\nBlackstone\u2019s decision to invest in\nOatly also encourages and pressures\nboth big and small investors to put their\nmoney into \u2018greener\u2019 projects (which\nis how Oatly justifies this decision in\na statement on their website). This\napproach diverts these huge investments\naway from companies that don\u2019t view\nsustainability as a priority and sets a\nprecedent for said companies to change\nthis. Oatly\u2019s explanation sends exactly\nthis message: \u201cWith global private\nequity working toward a green future,\nwe actually have a chance of saving the\nplanet for future generations\u201d. If financial institutions are to consider companies\u2019 environmental footprint in their\ninvestment decisions, we must start\nspeaking their language: profit.\nOf course, companies that claim to\nbe sustainable should be held accountable for the decisions they make. I think\nif society accepted all the decisions that\nsustainable businesses made without\nquestion, we would be setting ourselves\nback in the fight against climate change.\nBut to create real, long-term change,\ninstead of immediately \u2018cancelling\u2019 businesses like Oatly, we must allow them to\nlearn while growing- only this can show\ninvestors and corporations that sustainability is the future.\nNatalia Glazman Sustainability writer\nAlternative perspective\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nOatly should be\nheld accountable\nLIVINGSUSTAINABLY\nIn light of recent events\nmany oat fanatics\nhave lost hope in there\nbeing a truly sustainable oat milk option in\nthe supermarket. Yes,\nthat\u2019s right, in a capitalist world there is no\nsuch thing as ethical\nconsumption. Who\nwould've thought?\nHowever, a way of reducing emissions related to the transport and\nproduction of putting\noat milk in a carton is\nto make your own at\nhome. The post-milk\ngeneration have decided to drop the drama\nand make their own\noat beverage seeing as\nthe process is relatively\nsimple and cheap.\nHere is our recipe that\nhopefully won\u2019t come\nout too slimy for you:\n1.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nNew NHS contact tracing app released\n- a hopeful second attempt\nAfter a partially failed first attempt\nback in June, the second NHS\nCOVID-19 contact tracing app, released on 24th September, has garnered\nover 10 million downloads.\nAn automated contact tracing app periodically monitors and registers a user\u2019s\ncontact with another individual (either\nknown or unknown) by broadcasting\nand receiving a key code composed\nof a random set of characters through\nBluetooth Low Energy. This key code\nis changed regularly to maintain the\nanonymity of the user, and a list of past\nkey codes is stored locally. Additionally,\nan encounter list tracks the codes of\nregistered contacts. Users can log their\nCOVID-19 test results in the app, and\nif the result indicates a positive, then\nan alert is generated for those on the\nencounter list, who are then instructed\nto self-isolate to limit transmission.\nThe new NHS app takes a decentral-ised approach and uses the Exposure\nNotification API, a toolkit collabora-tively developed by Apple and Google.\nThis approach aims to prioritise\nuser privacy and anonymity\nby processing user information locally\nto generate\nexposure\nalerts.\nIn con-trast, the first\nattempt took\na centralised approach where user\ndata is uploaded to\nand processed by a central NHS server. While\nthis allows the NHS to\naccumulate a rich dataset\nthat could be analysed by ep-idemiologists, privacy concerns\nand security vulnerabilities were\nfelt to outweigh the benefits. Interestingly, the first app has been shown\nto work on a greater number of older\ndevices and is more accurate in measuring the contact distance. However, the\napp was forced to circumvent Apple\u2019s\nprivacy measures to avoid background\nBluetooth activity, but even this custom\nsolution had a few bugs. Considering\nApple\u2019s strict App Store policies,\nthis app was at a high risk of being\nrejected for publication regard-less, so the UK government set\nto work on the development\nof the second application\nin parallel that used\nthe Apple-Google\ntoolkit.\nAccuracy\nwhile respecting privacy\nis the main\naim of\ndecen-tralised\ncontact\ntracing apps.\nHowever, recent\nreports have shown the\napp to sacrifice the accuracy aspect with false readings of close\ncontact and disappearing exposure\nnotifications caused by bugs in the Apple-Google API.\nThe effectiveness of this second application in slowing the pace of the virus is\nyet to become clear. Experts have mixed\nopinions on how automated contact\ntracing can help reduce transmission.\nFor example, a study from Oxford\nindicates that even low levels of app\nadoption would help save lives, whereas\none from UCL found that large scale\nadoption of the app and integration\nwith a public health response is crucial\nfor any significant impact. However,\nboth studies agree that automated\ncontact tracing can indeed complement\nmanual contact tracing.\nDespite an unsuccessful first at\ntempt, it is commendable that the NHS\nimmediately began work on a second\napp in parallel with instead of in opposition to technology giants. If it were\nthe latter, it could\u2019ve potentially led to\na much worse situation. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in the UK we\ncan only hope that this new app will\nmake a significant difference.\nIn order to put an end to the global coronavirus pandemic, researchers\naround the world are working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to protect\nagainst COVID-19. While vaccine\nproduction usually takes multiple\nyears, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped\ntobedevelopedwithin12-18months.\nVaccine testing can be split into 5\nstages:\nPre-clinical \u2013 animal testing to see\nwhether the vaccine elicits an immune\nresponse.\nPhase I \u2013 healthy human volunteers\nto determine safety and evaluate immune response.\nPhase II \u2013 hundreds of volunteers to\nidentify correct dosage.\nPhase III \u2013 thousands of volunteers\nto confirm safety and efficacy vs. a\nplacebo.\nPhaseIV\u2013studiesonadverseeffects,\nlong-termmmunityandvaccineusage\nfollowing the approval and licensing\nof the vaccine.\nThe WHO is currently tracking the\nprogress of over 170 candidate vac-cines; at Felix, we\u2019ve chosen 5 of the\nmost promising candidates to follow,\nso watch this space!\nNew Update: Last week, new results\nof the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine clinical trial were published in Nature,\nshowing that the vaccine can induce a\nrobust immune response.\nCOVID-19 VACCINE TRACKER: Felix Edition\nJulia Dabrowska Science Editor\nSudarshan Sreeram Tech Editor tively developed by Apple and Google.\nThis approach aims to prioritise\nuser privacy and anonymity\nby processing user information locally\nto generate\nexposure\ntrast, the first\na centralised approach where user\nand processed by a central NHS server.

    "content": "Over 500,000 cases. More than\n40,000 dead. The largest recession\non record. The UK\u2019s response to the\ncoronavirus pandemic has left much\nto be desired, and with the start of a\nsecond wave already exceeding the\nrecorded case numbers of the first peak,\ntime is running out for the government\nto act decisively with evidence-based\npolicies. How did the government get\nthis so wrong, and what, if anything, did\nit get right?\nIn 2016, a secret government drill\ncalled Exercise Cygnus was carried out\nto test the pandemic preparedness of the\nUK. Specifically, the virus it looked at\nwas influenza, not a coronavirus, however there were many similarities between\nthe simulated disease and COVID-19,\nnamely that they were both fast-spread-ing acute respiratory diseases.\nCygnus told the Government something it did not want to hear: that the\nUK was woefully unequipped to deal\nwith a pandemic. At a time of austerity,\nsimulations predicted the overwhelming of an underfunded NHS that was\nlacking enough ICU beds and personal\nprotective equipment (PPE). However,\nrather than act on the findings of this\ndrill, the report was buried on the basis\nof national security.\nFlash forward to 30th January 2020,\nwhen the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) announced to the world a\nPublic Health Emergency of International Concern occurring in Wuhan,\nChina. Despite the WHO warning\ngovernments about the severity of this\nissue, the current Prime Minister, Boris\nJohnson, missed five consecutive emergency COBRA meetings at the start of\nthe crisis; already putting the country\u2019s\nresponse on a weak footing.\nOn the 3rd March, more than a\nmonth after the initial WHO warning,\nthe Government announced its plan to\n\u201cContain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate\u201d. By this time, the situation was\ndeveloping quickly in Italy, which was\ndeemed to be a \u2018few weeks ahead\u2019 in the\npandemic, and thus was hit particularly\nseverely. Italy entered a national lockdown a week later on the 10th March,\nwith the crisis serving as a warning to\nother countries, including the UK. Yet\nthe Government pursued a different\nstrategy, known infamously as the \u2018herd\nimmunity\u2019 strategy.\nRevealed by the Government\u2019s Chief\nScientific Adviser Sir Patrick\nVallance at a press conference\non 12th March, the public\nwas told that the Government was not trying to\nstop them from catching\nthe disease. \u201cIt\u2019s not desir-able, because you want to\nget some immunity in the\npopulation\u201d,\nsaid Vallance. The\naim of this\nstrategy\nwas to\nlet the\nvirus\nspread, allowing the surviving population to build a degree of immunity\npost-recovery, and putting an end to any\nfurther COVID-19 transmission in the\nUK. This would rely on the phenomenon of herd immunity: when a critical\nproportion (thought in this case to be\naround 60%) of the population have\nimmunity to an infectious disease, it can\nstop spreading. And yes \u2013 letting 60%\nof people get infected is as crazy as it\nsounds.\nWhy was the Government pursuing\na strategy of letting a deadly virus tear\nthe population, potentially causing the\ndeaths of hundreds of thousands of elderly and vulnerable people? It claimed\nto be \u201cfollowing the science\u201d \u2013 yet later\ndevelopments of premature reopenings\nover the summer implied that their reasoning could be more ideological than\nscientific.\nMeanwhile, experts such as Richard\nHorton, editor of prestigious medical\njournal The Lancet, and Anthony Costello, professor of\nglobal health at UCL,\nwere urging the Government to act and\nbring about tougher\nmeasures to \u2018flatten the\ncurve\u2019. On\nMarch 15th, the discrepancies between\nthe UK and European strategies were\nalso highlighted by then Leader of the\nOpposition Jeremy Corbyn, to no avail.\nOn March 16th, Imperial College\nmodelling that showed the UK was on\ntrack for 250,000 deaths was released\nby Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the\nepidemiologists sitting on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\n(SAGE). Modelling was also conducted\nwith an alternative strategy of intermittent restrictions, showing a reduced\ndeath toll of 20,000 \u2013 on the same order\nof magnitude as our current death toll.\nIt was this modelling that, when presented to the Government, caused an\nimmediate change in strategy, with case\nisolation and social distancing measures\nintroduced on the same day. Mass gatherings were also banned, but this was\ntoo little, too late, and Johnson would\nend up declaring a full-scale lockdown\nmerely seven days later.\nHow did we go from a full-scale\nlockdown to a foreboding second wave?\nAll shall be answered next week, in the\nsecond part.\nFRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nHow (not) to respond to a pandemic -Part One\nSCIENCE\nA SWAN SONG\nTRIPPING AT THE\nSTARTING LINE\nEditor\u2019s Note\nThe public backlash to the herd\nimmunity strategy was inevitable,\nhowever it was met with derision\nfrom the liberal commentariat.\nBizarre tweets the day after the an-nouncement, such as from former\nEd Miliband adviser and commentator Ayesha Hazarika calling the\nbacklash \u201chipster analysis\u201d, and\nfrom BBC comedy show Have I\ngot News For You, mocking the\nopinion of a man-made pandemic\nexpert \u2018Dave from Wigan\u2019, served\nto tell the public one thing: shut\nup and let the Government do\nwhat it wants.

    "content": "Back in 2010 my brother introduced me to my\nfirst souls-like which just happened to be the\nfirst ever souls-like, Demon\u2019s Souls. It was pun-ishing, especially for my juvenile mind. What sort\nof a psychopath makes a game which gets harder\nthe more you fail? However, the first time I felt the\nwarm squelch of the phalanx under the boots of\nmy fluted armour, I knew why they\u2019d done it and it\nwas a masterpiece.\nEver since then, like a junky with a limitless over-draft, I\u2019ve sought greater challenges to recapture the\nhigh that only Demon\u2019s Souls could give me. New\ngame +7 on Dark Souls \u2013 the sun praises me. The Last\nof Us on grounded \u2013 baby food picked out of my teeth\nwith a flick knife. Metro 2033 on Ranger Hardcore \u2013\nyou don\u2019t need ball bearings when you\u2019ve got balls of\nsteel.\nNothing has come\nclose to recapturing\nthe sense of achievement my 13-year-old self felt when I\nlulled the old one\nback to sleep. So you\ncan imagine my excitement when Sony\nannounced a Demon\u2019s Souls remaster\nat their PS5 reveal\nevent. A wise Ubisoft script writer once\nsaid \u201cDid I ever tell\nyou what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same\nfucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to\nchange...\u201d what they didn\u2019t realise though is that I\u2019m\nnot expecting shit to change \u2013 I\u2019m an addict and that\nfeeling I got from Demon\u2019s Souls is my drug.\nBut what does it mean for folk who never got the\nchance to play Demon\u2019s Souls the first time\naround? Well, for starters you\u2019ll get to see\nwhere one of the most popular and punishing franchises (and genres) started. Demon\u2019s\nSouls blend of show don\u2019t tell storytelling,\nchallenging combat and sprinkling of Lovecraftian horror made it a joy to play and\nguarantees that if you can \u201cgit gud\u201d (admit-tedly, not a trvial propositions) you\u2019ll have a\ngreat time. On top of that, you\u2019ll get to experience true hardship. Souls games are the\nonly experience worse than living through\nan economic collapse, global pandemic and\na race war simultaneously \u2013 once you\u2019ve encountered your first archdemon you\u2019ll wonder why you\never worried about\nthe impacts\nof 2020 on\nyour career plans and\nfuture life prospects.\nThe most exciting element of the\nremake though is the\npotential for expansion on the original\nproject. The PS3 release featured five distinctly themed levels\naccessed through five\n\u201cArch-stones\u201d found\nin the game\u2019s hub-world. There was however, a sixth.\nThis stone has been desecrated in game \u2013 a memorial to the cut sixth world which still exists within the\ngame\u2019s code. The stone would have provided access to\nthe land of giants in the cold north. It is likely that\nthis realm, its demons and their archdemon, may just\nmake it into the remake of the game. Us veterans of\nthe Soul\u2019s series are sustained by hope alone and the\nsixth Arch-stone has long been a source of sustenance.\nMost importantly this remake gives the next generation of gamers the chance to play a diamond in\nthe rough, polished to perfection, and to experience\none of the greatest feelings in gaming. Approaching\na challenge and getting kicked into the dirt over and\nover again until eventually, through sheer force of will\nand a bit of luck, you scrape past that challenge in the\nnick of time only to have to do it another 20 times.

But these elements in 6th century medieval India, manifested through Tantra, played a huge\nrole in shaking up orthodoxy and redefining not just\nHinduism or Buddhism, but the cultural and traditional practices of the subcontinent and South-East\nAsia for centuries to come.\nTantra, meaning \u2018to weave\u2019, is probably the most\nmisunderstood aspect of Eastern religiosity in the\nWest. Spanning a history of over 15 centuries, and\nstill quite active as a distinct practice among various\nsects in India, Tantra is a cross-cultural and mul-ti-religious spiritual philosophy, espousing spirituality through the material world. A philosophy\nstripped of the rampant patriarchy and hierarchies\nof power prevalent in the erstwhile traditions of the\nSubcontinent.\nTheexhibitiontracesthehistoryof Tantrathough\nthe ages, beginning with its origins in challenging\nHindu orthodoxy, its adoption by Buddhism and\nlater by the Mughal rulers (giving the philosophy an\nIslamic touch), and finally viewed from the perspective of the British Empire, at which point \u2014 around\nthe wake of the independence movement in the sub-continent, Tantra as a practice became politically\ncharged.\nAt the turn of the 6th century, Hinduism offered\na codified religious landscape. It was around this\ntime that by subverting this strict orthodoxy, Tantra\noffered/promised power through ritualistic practic-es, and in doing so found sanctuary and widespread\nacceptance in the political turbulence of the era. Sex\nand death, often seen with disgust and considered\nimpure, were adopted and embraced deeply within\nthe practice.\nThe exhibition traces the origins of this tradition\nwith sculptures of Tantric deities and yoginis (shape\nshifting goddesses), ritualistic Sanskrit verses on\npalm leaves and audio enchantments giving the exhibition an eerie feeling. A key tenet of Tantra was\nto free oneself of limiting attachments such as fear\nand disgust, and this principle can be clearly seen\nand appreciated in the exhibits. There is an imposing 10th century granite relief of Bhairava, a deity in\nHinduism, with his guard dog who scours the graveyards and feasts on the flesh of the corpses. This violence or gore is present throughout \u2014 skull caps\nused to feast on blood, statues of yoginis devouring\ntantric practitioners who showed fear, and of course\nsculptures depicting ritualistic sexual intercourse.\nThe exhibition boasts a well-crafted audio-visual\nrecreation of a ritualistic practice in a 10th century\ntemple from Eastern India dedicated to Yoginis.\nTantric rituals viewed the body as a tool, and just\nas with ritualistic sex, yoga was seen a conduit to attaining power. Although Tantra was born out a will\nto subvert the orthodoxy of medieval Hinduism, it\nwas shaped as much by Buddhism. Strikingly, a majority of the shock and awe exhibits in the exhibition belong to this period of its history. Buddhists\nmonks donning aprons made of human bones and\nskull caps is indeed a sight too\ndifficult to visualize and reconcile with, given\nmodern mainstream perceptions on the reli-gion. The exhibit\nalso touches on\nthe Islamic interpretations of the\nsubject, predominantly through\npaintings from\nthe Mughal\ncourt.\nArguably the\nlatter parts of\nthe exhibition,\ntracing Tantra\naround the independence movement in the subcontinent in late\n19th and early\n20th century are\nmuch easier to\nfollow.

The result is a rather timeless\nlisten that will leave you floating above\nyour desk/bed/sofa in a cocoon of musical rapture.\nWhen the World was One\u2019s listenabili-ty is in a large part thanks to it\u2019s produc-tion.

On the\nthird record of the New Orleanian\u2019s centennial trilogy\n(celebrating the centenary of the first recorded jazz\nsong), Scott\u2019s languid, breathy and often multi-tracked\ntrumpet lines are a delight upon the ear. The Emancipation Procrastination\u2019s dark, spacious electronic and\nhip-hop tinged instrumentals built upon skittering\ndrums and warped guitar create a sublime darkness,\nwhich intertwine perfectly with Scott\u2019s innocent\nmelodies. Personal favourites include \u2018AvengHer\u2019 and\n\u2018Ashes of Our Forever\u2019.\nR&B: D\u2019Angelo \u2013 Voodoo\nConsidered by many to be the \u2018greatest neo-soul\nrecord of all time\u2019, and from sex symbol D\u2019Angelo\nhimself, there should be little doubt in reader\u2019s minds\nthat this record is dangerously sexy. Here I would be\npraising the singer-songwriter\u2019s breathy and often\nmulti-tracked vocal lines if I had not already used that\nexact phrasing earlier this article, suffice to say D\u2019Angelo\u2019s voice is sweet and sticky in equal measure.\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s song writing here makes a conscious\neffort to homage classic soul with the addition of a\nmore hip-hop focused approach to groove (thanks in\nno small part to Questlove\u2019s innovative drum work).\nThe result is an intricate set of tracks distilling the essence of ballads from soul icons like Marvin Gaye with\nmore rhythmic intrigue, moulding a perfectly sensual\natmosphere. I find myself enthralled by almost every\ntrack but would suggest avoiding \u2018Left and Right\u2019 due\nto its aggresive features courtesey of the Wu-Tang clan.\nRap: 108 \u2013 Mission Infinite\nThis obscure gem has seen a recent resurgence in\npopularity thanks to a repressing from NBN Archives.\nMission Infinite\u2019s distinctly lo-fi, woozy beats and enjoyable but never show stealing or overwhelming flows\nmake it about as good a rap album for the bedroom as\none could imagine. I was personally a little surprised\nby the number of people that listed hip-hop tracks as\ntheir go to in the sack, but to each their own \u2013 give\nthis one a spin too.\nRock: T-Rex \u2013 Electric Warrior\nHaving heard T-Rex frontman Marc Bolan\u2019s name\nin the same sentence as Bowie\u2019s more times than I\nwould care to mention, I was quite surprised at the\nlow-key nature sound of Electric Warrior. While\nlyrical themes of sexuality and a blurred gender are\nhere in spades, the instrumentals are decidedly low-key. Prominent bass and drums imbue each tune here\nwith smooth grooves; however, Bolan\u2019s vocals and lead\nguitar are low enough in the mix to add flavour without overwhelming the listener. This makes this LP the\nperfect rock choice for an intimate evening.\nMusic for Two Part 2\nMiles Gulliford Music Editor\nWhen the World was One\nArtist: Mathew Halsall and the\nGondwana Orchestra\nForfansof: Miles Davis, Dorothy\nAshby\nTopTracks: Tribute to Alice Coltrane\nRuntime: 63 mins\nFelix Recommends\nHo, why is you here?\nArtist: Flo Milli\nForfansof:Megan Thee Stallion,\nRico Nasty\nTopTracks:Like That Bitch, In The\nParty, 19, May I\nRuntime: 30 mins\nMiles Gulliford Music Editor\nTHIS RECORD IS\nDANGEROUSLY SEXY.\n\u201c\nSex survey\nFRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\n41\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "The General is 7100 feet\nof Buster\u2019s finest film.\nEntering the public domain\nin 1954, it represents what\nis best about the silent era:\ntesting the limits of a new art-form, with a healthy\ndisregard for health and safety. The film follows\nJohnnie Gray (played by Keaton), a train engineer\nwho, being ineligible for the Confederate army,\ndecides to take matters into his own hands in a\nbid to rescue his fianc\u00e9e Annabelle Lee (Marion\nMack) from a Union faction, and simultaneously\nthwart the advances of the Northern army. The\nfilm is all about the chase: Keaton on one train\n(the Texas), chasing the Union army on another\n(The General) (and later Keaton on The General,\nbeing chased by the Union army on the Texas!).\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen stunts before, think\nagain. During filming: Buster was knocked out;\na director was shot in the head with a blank; the\nwood-burning engines caused numerous fires;\ndams were erected; railroads were built; some poor\nsod had his foot run over and began legal action.\nFor sheer spectacle, the train wreck scene is the\nmost expensive single shot of the entire silent era\nat $42,000 (the surrounding town declared a local\nholiday just to witness it). From the comfortable\nconfines of the 21st century, I\u2019d\nsay the mayhem was all worth it:\nThe General is a landmark in film\nhistory. It\u2019s been almost 100 years\nsince it came out, and I do not\ndoubt that its delights will persist\nfor 100 more.\nFree Film of the Week: The General (1926)\nClassic of the Week: The Shining\nEditor Recommends\nWhile the idea of conscious deliberation in Art\nis popular, it is not supreme. The editorial\nmechanism feels predominant because it\u2019s explaina-ble, but edits and rewrites are driven by impulses that\nare never understood. That an artist sees one phrase\nas more fitting than another, or one fabric a more\nsuitable shade of violet, is impossible to satisfactorily\nexplain. The artist relies on the unconscious miasma\nof nurture and nature to spit out artistic truth. Even\nthe most refined editorial know-how is incapable of\nentertaining an idea that never springs to mind. Great\ndirectors need no more than these mechanisms. Their\nartistic intuition so closely coincides with \u2018artistic fact\u2019\n(i.e. those things that make us think and make us feel),\nthat few external tools are necessary.\nIn the case of Stanley Kubrick, the divine intuition is for \u2018orchestrated terror\u2019. Being an instinct, this\nsensibility is naturally genreless, and as such we find a\ncalculated, rhythmic fear coursing through the veins\nof his entire filmography. We can feel it in 2001: A\nSpace Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange,\nand Eyes Wide Shut, but it finds its most evocative\nshape in The Shining. Amid an almost faultless canon,\nThe Shining stands out for its algorithmic potency. Its\ncogs are positioned and oiled in such a way as to exact\nprecise responses from the audience. What emotions\nwe attribute to circumstance, are in fact as predestined\nas the characters we\u2019re watching. We may not notice\nthe knives looming over Danny\u2019s head in every kitchen scene, nor do we notice the changing layout of the\nOverlook Hotel, but these details are not wasted on\nour unconscious minds\u2014they fester and build a cloud\nof portent and deception. In The Shining, the stately\npoise of Barry Lyndon harmonises with the frightening ceremony of A Clockwork Orange, amounting\nto what I think is Kubrick\u2019s finest film, the greatest\nexample of his craftsmanship. (Incidentally, it is of no\nsurprise that HAL 9000\u2019s callous duplicity, or feigned\ncontrition, is directed so naturally in 2001\u2014HAL is\nthe incarnation of Kubrick\u2019s practice.) All too often,\nthe horror genre is dumbed down in, look to the\ndumb gore of the Saw franchise, or token jump-scares.\nThe Shining separates itself from dull conventions\u2014\nevery speck of blood is deliberate, necessary, and\nconsidered.\nYet The Shining\u2019s true history can easily become\ndistorted. It was in fact the only one of Kubrick\u2019s last\nnine films not to receive a nomination for an Oscar or\na Golden Globe. Rather embarrassingly, it did inspire\nKubrick\u2019s only Razzie nomination. However, its negative reception was nowhere more apparent than in\nthe words of Stephen King, who reportedly said that\nthe film was the only adaptation of his work that he\ncould \u201cremember hating\u201d. At first it seems that King\nthought of Kubrick\u2019s film less as an adaptation and\nmore of a ransacking. Ultimately, the idea of a faithful adaptation necessarily translating into quality on\nthe screen is a mirage. Indeed, King\u2019s own forays into\nTV/Film prove this. The 1997 miniseries The Shining\n(written by King, and starring Rebecca De Mornay) is\na more faithful take on the novel, but it\u2019s universally\nseen to have fallen short of Kubrick\u2019s 1980 standard.\nKing evidently respected\nKubrick\u2019s instinct and\nthe need for artistic liberties to be taken, since he\nwrote in his 1981 book\nDanse Macabre that The\nShining had \u201ccontributed\nsomething of value to\nthe [horror] genre\u201d, and\nstated that it was one of\nhis \u201cpersonal favourites\u201d.\nIt must be noted that,\nwith regard to seeing The\nShining as praiseworthy, King was ahead of the game.\nThe cultural re-evaluation of The Shining took much\nlonger than a year. Perhaps the movie needed its own\nspace\u2014after all, it did open on the same weekend as\nThe Empire Strikes Back. While this may account for\nits slightly low box office takings, it does not account\nfor the notably negative critiques of its quality. Perhaps Kubrick simply pushed the envelope so boldly (as\nin 2001) that contemporary tastes were unable to keep\nup. In any case, when we compare it to other movies\nthat have received similar re-evaluations, and also\nshared opening weekends with Star Wars movies\u2014I\u2019m\nthinking of Friedkin\u2019s Sorcerer in 1977\u2014 The Shining\nhas fared extremely well. It now stands as a cinematic\nmonument to what is possible in the hands of genius\ndirectors, in whom works the most divinely unex-plainable intuition. As we mark The Shining\u2019s 40th\nanniversary, we should look at it not as something\nmerely to be remembered, but rather as a monolith on\nsome distant hill, the path to which modern horror\nshould strive to retrace.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nThe General\nFRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com 43\nDirectedby: Stanley Kubrick\nYearof Release: 1980\nStarring: Jack Nicholson; Shelley Duvall; Danny Lloyd;\nScatman Crothers\nDirectedby: Clyde Bruckman; Buster Keaton\nYearof Release: 1926\nStarring: Buster Keaton; Marion\nMack\nThe Shining\n\u201cI was more proud of that picture than any I ever made\u201d \u2014\nKeaton\nScan to watch!\n\n"

Read below for a little overview of what\npieces and styles will shine this season!\nThis iconic piece has been around for several seasons,\nbut it is still there and evolving with interesting additions and a twist! This season, they are seen oversize\n(of course) and belted, but also \u2013 and this is fresh and\nstriking: cropped! Yes still oversized fit on the shoulders but cropped slightly above or at the waist! This\ncool twist, gives such an edgy and distinctive shape!\nLike the original blazer, it works well as a matching\n2-piece suit, however you can also style it with high\nwaisted jeans. This will emphasise nice pants and highlight your waist or even show a bit of tummy on\nwarmer days!\nAnother hot trend\nincorporating the\nblazer is the 2-piece\nsuit with a skirt. It\nhas been seen a lot\nrecently! Careful it\nis not a workwear\npencil skirt, but a\nshorter and straight\nskirt, that can look\nlike the extension\nof the blazer for a\nperfect preppy and\nstylish look.\nA lot of amazing\nleather pieces were\nseen on the runways,\nand many were not\nin the classic black!\nThe brown palette\ntones like beige,\ncaramel, maroon,\nrust are per-fect for\nautumn! Trousers\nare an easy piece to\nuse for this trend, in a loose and straight cut, and work\nwell with all other materials like knitwear and coats.\nAlso, shirts made of lovely leather have been seen\nquite a lot, worn open as a\nsecond layer or closed as a top.\nPS: a shirt/ jacket is called a\nshacket (yes it is a thing ap-parently!). Long leather boots\nwere seen in all shades, boldly\novertaking the basic black. To\nconclude, the full leather look\nis welcomed and even encour-aged. For the most daring of\nyou, try in a sleeve-less jacket\nand bermuda or a full-length\ndress with boots.\nAfter the focus on sleeves in previous seasons, it is\ncollar time. This season they are large, embroidered,\nasymmetric\u2026 This is seen in an array of materials\n(crisp white poplin,\nknit, leather, hint\nhint\u2026) and the collar\nbecomes the centre\nof attention of the\nlook. It is a very work\nappropriate trend, on\nthe more chic side,\nespecially on a white\nshirt. If you\u2019re more\nof a casual style you\ncan try the knitwear\nversion, which is also\nmuch warmer for those\nchilly autumn days!\nThe cardigan worn\nas a top was already a\nbig trend last season,\nand it\u2019s still here this\nautumn, incorporating\nthe collar addition or\nsome frill detail!\nSeen everywhere since\nthe autumn collections\nhave been released\nfrom catwalks to high\nstreet brands, something I had seen creeping last season is now fully entering the fashion scene:\nvests aka sleeve-less, but on jumpers. It gives a totally\ndifferent look from the full sleeve ones, and it\u2019s perfect\nfor layering! With\na nice plain shirt\nfor a monochrome\ncombination\n(looking so chic\nand effortless\nin whites and\ncreams) or with a\ntrendy pattern to\nelevate that look\nwith pieces that\ngrab attention.\nThey can give you the full preppy look that we love!\nThey are seen paired with wide legged trousers or cigarette pants. The only issue in this trend for me in our\nnot so warm climate\u2026 is potentially getting cold arms?\nOh well it\u2019s all for fashion, right?\nShoes wise, boots are always the star of the show in\nautumn/ winter. This year, they are flat, mid-rise,\nrounded boots with a thick sole! I think they look like\na mix between combat boots and Chelsea boots. The\noriginal is by Bottega Veneta, but now many other\nbrands have taken up the style and they will be everywhere this autumn. They are more versatile than combat boots as you can still use them in a chic look. You\ncan style them beautifully with a girly baby doll dress\nto break the look or with a blazer dress and a mini bag\n(yes, as with the few previous seasons the tinier the\nbetter with bags!). Another way to style the boots, in\na more rock or street style, is paired with boyish pants\nor jeans tucked into the boots, yes, we want to be bold\nand really elevate the looks this season.\nBeen loving this trend on runways since it arrived!\nThe chains are big and gold and adorn everything\nfrom handbags to jackets to jumper collars and not\nforgetting jewellery. For a more chic and minimalist\nstyle, dainty little chains work and for a more daring\nand bolder look, a chunky chain will be the star of the\noutfit. My favourites were the Stella McCartney chain\non handbag look and the Balmain oversized chain\nsingle earring.\nTrends we\u2019re falling for:\nMarianne Gazet Fashion Writer\nAutumn 2020\nOH WELL IT\u2019S ALL\nFOR FASHION,\nRIGHT?\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia and Creative Commons\n(Make a) Statement\ncollars\nKnitted vests\nThe Blazer is still there\nLeather/faux\nleather in all\nshades\nShoes: chunky boots!\nAccessories:\nChain(ed to the trends)\nWhy not go one step further? Pair leather and a blazer for a look that cries\nout sophistication and (not) subtley not giving a fuck\n\n"

Despite the stereo-type, this is not because the majority are not having\nsex which means a large percentage of people are\nhaving frequent sex without getting a test. There is\nstill a lot of shame surrounding STIs which may explain this figure but as most of these infections are\neasily curable and not serious unless left undetected,\nit makes sense for everyone to get tested.\nReading about sexual harassment in the news over the last few\nyears has been shocking for many but even more shocking is that\nthis isn\u2019t just happening to people in the entertainment industry but\nalso to students attending Imperial. Two out of every 15 females\nhas been sexual harassed once, with one of those saying it has\nhappened multiple times. Males are much less likely to be sexually\nharassed, around 5 times less.

    "content": "tack on individuality and without the necessary structures to allow discordant ideologies to be showcased,\nthe landscape of art became increasingly polarised.\n\u201cHatred of popular\nculture was also to\ndefine a generation of\nAmerican intellectuals,\nand their claim to a\nsuperior sensibility,\u201d\nMishra writes, \u201cPolitical defeat, isolation and\nirrelevance had devastated their old presuppositions about art and\nits relation to human\nbeings\u201d. And perhaps\nthey had a reason to be\nfearful. If the focus of\nArt shifted from the\naesthetic to the mimetic\nin the past, our new\ndirection seems to be\ntowards the \u201crelatable\u201d.\nRelatable content,\nsuch as the widespread\npopularity of memes,\nself-insert fanfics, and viral TikTok videos only serve\nto impersonate a form of contrived togetherness like\nthe Barnum-effect of horoscopes. It is reflexive rather\nthan reflective, reactionary rather than revelatory. But\nwhile mainstream media with its inseparable ties to\ncapitalism and a senseless drive to sell may have stifled\ncreativity and expression, to reject all mass media as a\nclass distinct and beneath is to conflate an entire genre\nwith specific examples of bad art, and only introduces\nan unnecessary barrier to the audience that art seeks\nto serve. There are cases of outstanding art in common\nmedia just as there are examples of appalling works in\nthe most esteemed galleries.\nTo many, what really sets the two worlds apart isn\u2019t\nso much the product of the artist\u2019s imagination but\nrather the seed from which the idea itself grows.\nHighbrow artists, they maintain, will often reach\ndownwards towards the bawdy and the commonplace\nfor inspiration while your typical graphic designer\nlacks the necessary understanding and\nintellect to pluck fruit from the higher\nbranches of artistry. They believe their\ntrue talent lies in the ability to elevate\nthe normal and transfigure the mundane\ninto the extraordinary. But if a highbrow\nartist thinks that they are special for\nturning whores into Madonnas, then you\nonly have to watch an episode of Rupaul\u2019s\nDrag Race to see the effect in reverse. In\nfact, the layers of subversion only increase\nthe more you look at the premise and the\nexecution of the programme. In theory, a\nheavily-edited reality competition show\nwhere drag queens compete to out-dress,\nout-sing, and out-innuendo each other\nshould be the antithesis of good art and\nyet it is acclaimed by even the harshest of\ncritics for subverting a wild array of television tropes and challenging the worldview\nof millions. And it\ndoes that while being\nirreverent, fun and absurdly camp.\nGraphic novels have also started to\nsee its own blossoming as a medium to be taken seriously. Gone are\nthe days when comics were either\naimed just at children or relegated\nto the back of a newspaper. Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi\u2019s graphic\nnovel memoir detailing her childhood in Tehran, lived through the\nIslamic revolution, exemplifies how\ncross-cultural representation can\nbe both challenging and digestible,\nimportant and accessible. Even\nstand-up comedy, often thought\nof as a glorified Christmas cracker\njoke-telling, bears examples of masterful work such\nas Hannah Gadsby\u2019s Nanette (viewable on Netflix, a\nplatform some see as the enemy of good taste). For\nanime, you have the Madoka franchise which pairs\npowerful and reference-rich narrative with disturbingly alluring artwork by Gekidan Inu Curry. Good\nart is everywhere if you\u2019re looking for it, and to be\npigeon-holed by labels is to blind yourself to the very\nexperiences that inform great art.\nAnd here lies the true problem at the heart of artistic\nevaluation. To question how art should or could be\njudged is to question the very definition of art. Loathe\nto say it but Art is a social construct - with no inherent\nvalue, art is intrinsically tied to institutions and power\nstructures of the time and a slave to the dominating\nworldview. Art divorced from institutions risks not\nbeing seen and art that is unseen is by virtue not art\nat all. In a time when judgement and criticism comes\nswiftly and without pause, maybe it\u2019s time we all just\nsit back, relax, and enjoy art for ourselves, without\ndeferring to notions of sacred or mundane, highbrow\nor lowbrow, and woke or broke.\nFRIDAY 9TH OCTOBER 2020\nARTS\n39\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCredits: Mr Bean The Movie\nOkay!
