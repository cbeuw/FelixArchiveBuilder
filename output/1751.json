    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n16\nEternity in the air\nNews writer Nicolas Manrique chronicles his witness to the 640-year rendition of John Cage\u2019s \u2018As\nSLow As Possible\u2019 being attempted at the St. Burchardi Church, Halberstadt, Germany, where the\nfirst organ-chord change in over seven years took place recently in early September.\nI\nt is early in the morning on September 5th,\nand I am on a slow regional train from Berlin.\nThe destination is Halberstadt, a small town in\nSaxony-Anhalt. Its chocolate-box streets and\nimposing cathedral are perhaps reason enough\nto visit, but today a different attraction demands the\npilgrimage. Just north of the town centre, nestled\ninside a medieval cloister, stands the unassuming\nSankt-Burchardi church, and inside its nave you will\nfind the longest, slowest musical performance ever\nattempted. It began in September 2001 and doesn\u2019t\nintend to stop until the year 2640 \u2013 unless, of course,\nthe sheet music calls for a rest. The piece being played\nis John Cage\u2019s aptly named As Slow As Possible, usually known by the baffling acronym ASLSP, and this\nafternoon (3 o\u2019clock, to be precise) is the first time in\nseven years that a note is changing.\nWhenever you make a journey like this, it is always\nfun to see if you can tell which of your fellow passengers are making the same one. Who goes out of their\nway to see \u2013 hear? \u2013 this happen in person? Dr Rainer\nO. Neugebauer, the performance\u2019s director, reckons\nthat as many as 1000 people may descend on the town\nfor the note change, or Klangwechsel. Why so many?\n\u201cOn the one hand, ours is a very simple project: just\ntime, and air. When you\u2019re inside the church, you hear\nno melody, no rhythm\u2026 just this unchanging sound.\nBut on the other hand, it is a very philosophical\nproject. People think about time, and their lifetimes\u201d.\nHe himself has been confronted with such thoughts.\nIn 2011 a single pipe began sounding, playing a low\nD, which will not stop until 2071 \u2013 in his own words,\n\u201cI won\u2019t ever hear the end of this note!\u201d Moreover, Dr\nNeugebauer thinks that in a certain sense people are\nable to find more in this music than in any other: \u201cFor\nCage, all sounds were equal. The notes don\u2019t know\nabout Mozart, or Beethoven, they are just sounds;\nthey have no meaning \u2013 so people can give them whatever meaning they want.\u201d Perhaps I\u2019m doing this point\nof view a disservice by sharing my interpretation here\n\u2013 I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\nArriving early at Sankt-Burchardi, the first thing\nto notice is the emptiness. In place of pews and an\naltar, one finds bare ground, and specks of dust. And\nin the still air, a sound: following it, one finds the only\npermanent residents. On one side of the hall six great\nbellows work constantly to feed the organ\u2019s pipes; and\non the other sits the organ itself. It is a small instru-ment, with far too few pipes filling its wooden frame.\nAt its front are the sandbags responsible for playing\nthe keys \u2013 the project was unable to find a human\norganist with the required stamina.\nGradually, the nave fills with both people and\nanticipation for the note change. In truth it is more of\na note addition: the existing chord is being augmented\nby an E and a G#. The event proceeds almost ritualisti-cally, with Dr Neugebauer addressing the crowd from\na lectern and the organ being handled only with white\ngloves. Finally, soprano Johanna Vargas and composer\nJulian Lembke each install their respective pipe and\nthe change is complete. The air within the church\nchanges for the first time in almost a decade, and then\nit is over. The crowd applauds as the performers bow.\nAnd the music continues.\nBeing inside the church for the event itself, it is\neasy to see what Dr Neugebauer means. Surrounded\nby the endless sound, you are forced to think about\nwhat, if anything, it might be trying to say. In a town\nwhose own cathedral took hundreds of years to\ncomplete, one is reminded of how its ancient builders\nmust have felt, dedicating their hours to the completion of a fa\u00e7ade they would never live to see. In\nmodern times such time scales are unthinkable. Life\nappears to be accelerating at an ever-accelerating rate,\nyet here we find its very antithesis. The almost anticlimactic catharsis of the change itself is a reminder of\njust how alien this feels, like looking at the Mona Lisa\none square millimetre at a time.\nWill we as a people ever hear the end? 639 years is\nan especially long time in this age of climate change\nAnd the Music Never Stops\nCredits: Illustration by Nicolas Geiseler-Toran\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nThe decision to institute a national\nlockdown in the UK in response to\nthe coronavirus pandemic, announced\nvia televised address on the 23rd March,\ncame far too late.\nPandemics spread exponentially; as\nmore people get infected with a virus,\nthere is an even greater number of\npeople that the virus can infect, and if\nthat larger pool gets infected as well,\nthere is in turn an even bigger group\nthat the virus has access to. This exponential growth is characterised by R, the\neffective reproduction number. When\nR is above 1, the pandemic is growing\nexponentially. When it is below 1, it is\ndecaying exponentially. At a time where\nR is above 1, decisions must be taken\nproactively and decisively, because every\nday the threat becomes substantially\ngreater than before.\nNeil Ferguson, Imperial\u2019s lead epide-miologist who advised the government\nin the early days of the pandemic, told\nMPs on the Science and Technology\nselect committee that if the lockdown\nhad been instituted a week earlier, it\ncould\u2019ve halved the death toll. The key\nassumption for this estimate was based\non analysis that the epidemic was doubling every three to four days \u2013 locking\ndown a week earlier would\u2019ve been at a\ntime when infection rates were about\nfour times smaller than they were on\nthe day of lockdown. Unfortunately, a\nlot of time was wasted on a faulty \u2018herd\nimmunity\u2019 strategy in the critical days of\nthe pandemic, as covered in last week\u2019s\npiece.\nCare homes look after some of the\nmost vulnerable in our society, particularly those most at risk from COVID-19 \u2013 the elderly, and particularly\nthose with dementia who may struggle\nto adhere to new public health advice\nthrough no fault of their own. In July,\nstatistics from the Office of National\nStatistics (ONS) showed that 30,000\nexcess deaths took place in care homes\nduring the pandemic up to that point,\nwith COVID-19 being responsible for\ntwo thirds of these. Previous work from\nthe ONS suggested that many of the\ncases in the remaining third could also\nbe due to coronavirus.\nBut the government did little to\nprevent it. In fact, their policies actively\nencouraged it; in June it emerged that\nuntil mid-April, NHS policy was to\ndischarge patients back into care homes\nwithout needing a negative COVID-19 test. This meant that many of\nthe patients discharged back could have\nbeen carrying the virus straight into the\nenclosed spaces where some of the\nmost vulnerable people live.\nThis was nothing less than\nan extraordinary dereliction of duty that was not\nrectified until the peak of\nthe first wave.\nAs care homes are pri-vatised, care home companies have responsibility to procure adequate\npersonal protective\nequipment (PPE) for\ntheir staff. Shortages\nof PPE in care homes\nmeant that both\nstaff and\nresidents\nwere\nput at\nincreased risk of in-fection. However, these companies\noften shirked responsibility; the\nyoungest MP, Nadia Whittome,\nspoke out about the shortage of\nPPE at the care home she worked\nat as a second job. She was promptly\nsacked and accused of spreading misinformation by the care home, a claim that\nproved false months later as the care\nhome admitted that they did indeed\nhave a shortage of PPE at the time.\nWhile lockdown came too late, it\u2019s\nalso possible that it lifted too early.\nExperts, such as those from the Government\u2019s own Scientific Advisory Group\nfor Emergencies (SAGE), and those in a\nletter published\nby the British\nMedical\nJournal,\ncalled for\nlockdown\nto be eased\nmuch more\ngradually,\ncoupled\nwith an\neffective test and trace system. Professor Michael Baker of the University of\nOtago, who advised on New Zealand\u2019s\nworld renowned COVID response, also\nechoed the same message.\nYet the Government was adamant\nto see children returning to school in\nJune/July, despite it being the end of\nthe academic year, a period where not\nmuch learning takes place anyway. The\nGovernment also encouraged people\nto return the office, despite there being\nno need to do this for companies that\nhad adapted to operating remotely. This\nencouragement further put workers\nat risk, many of whom, particularly in\ndensely populated London, take public\ntransport to go to work.\nEven more bizarrely, the Government were quick to open pubs, and\ntheir popular Eat Out to Help Out\nscheme applied only to dine-in meals.\nThis incentivised people to crowd into\nrestaurants, many of which were not\neven observing proper social distancing.\nQueues formed outside of restaurants\nin August as Britons flocked to get\nhalf price discounts. Was the dine-in\nstipulation really necessary for this\nscheme? Surely the same restaurants could\u2019ve gathered even\nmore profit if the Government\nallowed the offer on takeaways,\nreducing the burden on waiting staff?\nPublic health\nexperts are generally unified\non the same\nmessage: we\ncannot rely on lock-downs, the best way out of this\nis to have an effective testing and tracing system. That\u2019s how New Zealand\nand Vietnam have less coronavirus\ncases than the White House, while\nalso experiencing a degree of return\nto normality.\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nHow (not) to respond to a pandemic -Part Two Photo credits: Simon Walker/HM\nA LATE LOCKDOWN\nCARE HOMES AND\nPPE\nA SUMMER OF\nSPREADING\n30k excess deaths in\ncare homes\nTHE TEST\nAND TRACE\nTRAVESTY\n\n"

    "content": "If the current pandemic has been good\nfor anything, it has been kindest\nto the act of reflection. So many people were trapped inside their homes,\nphysically separated from key aspects of\ntheir lives and livelihoods. Being stuck\ninside forces one to look within as well\nas without \u2013 increasingly people appear\nto have become aware of the negative\nways in which society has hitherto been\norganised, and much value has been\nplaced on the opportunity for idealistic introspection. But on the minds of\nmany, one practical question persisted\nthroughout the lockdown: when will\nthings return to normal? This call seems\nentirely reasonable. As pragmatists\nnever tire of pointing out, the long-term\neffects of a so-called \u201c90% economy\u201d\ncould be disastrous. What\u2019s more, the\nrhetoric of both the powers that be and\nthe average citizen often centres around\nthis idea of normality, and in particular\nhow to rediscover it. But I\u2019m not so sure\nabout the reasonableness of these calls,\nno matter how intuitive they appear \u2013\nwhat I do think is that their frequency\noffers an opportunity to talk about why.\nPerhaps the most striking thing about\ncalls for normality is how normal they\nthemselves have become. Before the\ncoronavirus pandemic much of global\npolitics was seen to be going through\na strange period; from the victories of\n\u201coutsider\u201d populists like Donald Trump\nand Jair Bolsonaro to the increasingly\nvolatile relationship between the East\nand West, there were no shortage of calls\nfor a return to a normal world order.\nBefore that even, who didn\u2019t wish they\nwere back before the Great Recession?\nAnd, wow, wasn\u2019t life a lot more normal before 9/11 \u2013 when will I be able to\nboard a plane normally again? It seems\nthat there is nothing more normal than\nabnormality.\nOf course, much of this can be understood under a rose-tinted lens. More often than not, people will look back and\nsee greener grass, and there is nothing\nsurprising about that. But what\u2019s interesting is how this rhetoric so effectively\nreproduces ideology: indeed, it has a\ndeeply political character. In the repeated framing of global issues as deviations\nfrom a normal social order, the latter is\neffectively petrified \u2013 it becomes entirely\nahistorical. After all, if our only metric\nof success is rooted in similarity to the\npast, how can we ever hope to reach the\nfuture?\nThis analytical angle cuts deeper too.\nWhen Fukuyama proclaimed the end of\nhistory after the fall of the Soviet Union,\nhe stressed that such an end could never apply to culture, but we appear to be\ntrying to force one nonetheless. Consider the precipitous rise in film and television remakes in recent years \u2013 in 2018,\n80% of top 20 grossing movies worldwide were based on unoriginal material.\nFrom fashion to advertising, we tend to\nplace an ever-higher value on retro and\nvintage aesthetics. In effect, our culture\nis littered with simulacra of a dead past.\nWe can therefore not only understand\nnormality as na\u00efve sentimentality, but\nalso as a sharp ideological tool keeping\nus from looking too far forward. The\nrhetorical and aesthetical vocabulary of\nlate capitalism haunts us with nostalgia\nforapastthatneverexisted,andsokeeps\nus suspended there. The normal is simply a ghost in the machine.\nGiven this predisposition to look\nbackwards, it is perhaps no wonder that\n(inwealthycountries,atleast)peopleare\nso pessimistic about the state of things.\nA 2017 Ipsos MORI study on the \u201cPerils\nof Perception\u201d found that, despite objective material improvements in global poverty and child mortality rates, a\nlarge majority of people think that these\nthings are at an all-time high. A similar\nsurvey by YouGov found that only 4%\nof Britons think the world is getting\nbetter. Such sentiment serves only to reinforce a regressive mindset. So, what is\nto be done? First, we need to recognise\nthe autonomy that humanity has over\nits condition and celebrate the successes which it has brought about. Perhaps\nmore importantly however, we must use\nthis celebration to motivate greater faith\nin our ability to continue this historical\nprogression. We should reflect upon but\nnot dwell within our past, indeed, within the old normal \u2013 we should seek to\nbuild a new one.\nWho would be an MP? The\nanswer that people often give to\nthat question is the rich, the power\nhungry, and the narcissists. There\nis widespread acceptance in British\nsociety that politicians are incompetent bastards, a view not entirely\ndisproven by their actions. However, we have only ourselves to blame\nfor this when we pay them so little.\nTo run the country, a task as large\nand complicated as any around, we\npay them the same as if they were\nmid-level managers at American\nExpress (\u00a382,000) or Head of Trading at John Lewis (\u00a390,000). Yet\nat the same time we ask and expect\nthem to be the best and brightest.\nUnfortunately, our best and brightest are at John Lewis where their\ntalents are appreciated. This creates\na disconnect between the value of\nthe work expected and the remuneration for the work. This deficit can\nbe addressed either by lowering the\nquality of the work done, leading\nthe Guardian to compile a ranking.\nof MPs by number of parliamen-FRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 111\nCOMMENT\nNews writer Nicholas Manrique argues that despite the changes in our lives since the start of the pandemic, we should learn to deal\nwith the new normal.\nWhy we shouldn\u2019t want things to\nreturn to normal\nNicholasManrique\nNewswriter\ntary votes missed, making up the\ndifference with inherited money or\nmoney earnt in other jobs or finally,\nbeing so power hungry that you\ndon\u2019t care how much you are paid.\nMost MPs tend to employ all three\nin differing amounts.\nThe outrage at the MPs\u2019 proposed\npay rise is just the most obvious of\nthe British obsession with keeping\ndown our elected officials. When\nTrump got ill he was flown to a special medical centre and he received\n24/7 medical care. The Americans\nunderstand that the death of a leader would be disastrous enough to do\neverything in their power to prevent\nit. In Britain, however, we still like\nto imagine that our leaders are just\nlike us, keeping them working out\nof a small townhouse in London.\nApparently, David Cameron would\nleave Cabinet meetings to go upstairs to make himself lunch because\nthere are no staff at 10 Downing\nstreet beyond a cleaner. We imagine\nourselves as a world power yet still\ntreat the business of ruling as an\namateurish game.\nIf we want a ruling class that can\nmake us proud, we should treat\nthem right. Pay them what they\nmight get in the private sector and\ngive them support in the form of\nstaff and proper buildings and\noffices to work out of.

    "content": "An active investment strategy re-quires, as the name suggests, an\nindividual, usually a portfolio manag-er, to make decisions about buying and\nselling shares on a daily basis. Given the\nconstant fluctuations in equity prices,\nespecially in uncertain economic times\nsuch as this one, an active approach can\nexceed the stock market\u2019s average re-turns. In order for this method to suc-ceed, thorough analysis and knowledge\nin particular market sectors is essential.\nThat is the reason why a portfolio manager usually works with a team of analysts responsible for predicting which\nasset\u2019s price will change and when. An\nundeniable advantage of this approach\nis the flexibility that it offers. Active investment managers can buy equity from\npromising companies, which have either recently entered the market or have\nundergone changes which made them\nmore competitive, at a moment\u2019s notice.\nIn contrast, passive investing aims for\na long-term profitability, which means\nselling and buying equity occurs rarely.\nThis stems from the buy-and-hold phi-losophy, which is opposed to attempting\nto predict the market\u2019s next move. There\nare two main ways of investing passively.\nThe first is to invest in and retain blue\nchip stocks. Those companies\u2019 stock is\ndeemed relatively safe because they have\na strong reputation for remaining prof-itable, even during periods of recession.\nHowever, purchasing an index fund,\nwhich is a type of security that tracks a\nmajor stock market index, such as the\nDow Jones Industrial Average, is the\nmost prevalent strategy.\nA market index is defined as a hypothetical investment portfolio which includes companies in a particular sector,\nsuch as software and energy. The existence of multiple indices is attributed to\nthe different mathematical methodologies used to create an index. Each methodology calculates the index\u2019s values by\nweighing parameters such as stock price\nand market capitalization differently. Index funds track the market\u2019s trajectory\nby selling equity from firms no longer\nincluded in the index and purchasing\nstock entering the index. This strategy\nresults in a significantly lower number\nof transactions occurring compared to\nactive investing.\nThe key benefit is the reduction in fees and\nrisk. Given that\nno team is required to manage the portfolio,\nthere are no labour costs associated with the\nanalysts\u2019 salaries\nand transaction\nfeesarelowerdue\nto fewer transactions happening. Risk is lowered because owning a miniscule piece of stock\nfrom thousands of consistently profitable firms results in the accumulation of\nreturns over a long\ntime period. However, as historical\ntrends have shown,\nthe decrease in risk\nleads to smaller re-turns, which tend to\nbe close to the market average. The buy\nand hold mentality\nof passive investing\nsuggests that index\nfunds may be slower\nto sell under-per-forming stock than active investors.\nThe debate between active and passive investing will not be settled- and\nthere\u2019s no reason for it to be concluded\nsince their advantages can be combined\nin a single strategy. This turbulent year,\nwhich will be marked by COVID-19\nand its effects on the global economy\nand the US Presidential election, has\ncaused prolonged uncertainty but also\ncreated potential new opportunities.\nIn particular, a Joe Biden victory\nwould prove beneficial to the renewable\nsector due to his proposed plan of a $2\ntrillion investment in building clean energy infrastructure. The US\u2019 stance on\nthe Climate Paris accord emission targets would also shift, which would make\ninvesting in green companies enticing.\nA Take on the Active vs Passive Equities\nAnother area where significant\npolicy changes may occur is\ntrade. A potential Biden ad-ministrationisexpectedtotake\nsteps to de-escalate tensions\nwith China and the European\nUnion by working to reduce\ntariffs.\nThis will prove beneficial to\nEuropean car markers and US\ncompanies which export their\nproducts primarily to China.\nOn the other hand, a Trump\nre-election would renew confidence in oil and gas shares as\nthese firms would avoid stricter\nregulations and potential tax\nincreases on account of their\nenvironmental impact. What\nseems of greater concern to\nthe investment community and\ncertainly the majority of economists is the approval of an\neconomic stimulus package.\nSpecifically, the current impasse prolongs uncertainty\nabout the state of the economy.\nConsequently, unless an agreement is reached before Election Day, it will be important\nto see if one party gains unified\ncontrol of the government.\nThe longer that the bill is delayed , the more severe the\ndownturn will be due to a wave\nof business bankruptcies and\ndefaults on retail and corporate loans. With an active investment approach, one could\nprofit significantly from selling stock of firms expected to\nbe positively affected by either\ncandidate\u2019s policy platform.\nHowever, if the election outcome leads to neither party\ncontrolling all branches of gov-ernment, legislation regarding\neither the stimulus bill or other\nissues, such as the environment\nand trade, will become difficult\nto pass, which alters expectations completely.\nUnder this scenario, the passive approach may yield better\nreturns.\nSome policy changes to look out for?\nFRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nINVESTMENT\n36\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nMarios Papadopoulos Investment writer\nDIFFERENT\nMATHEMATICAL\nMETHODOLOGIES\nARE USED TO\nCREATE DIFFERENT\nMARKET INDICES\n\u201c\nStock market volatility is important for investors.

Tesla has\nled the EV market, and its incredible\nsuccess has drawn the attention of many\ncompanies looking to dip their feet into\nthe pond of profit. Even non-automo-tive companies like Sony, Google, Apple, and even Epic Games have (in some\nway) experimented with consumer EVs.\nAmazon has recently partnered with\nRivian, a promising\nstartup in the EV\nrealm, to produce\nmore than 100,00\ndelivery trucks by\n2030. With government incentives in place for those\nlooking to purchase an EV, it\u2019s no\nwonder why there\u2019s been a recent\nboom in their popularity. With this\npopularity, however, comes demand,\nwhich calls for rapid advancement in\ntechnology - in this case, battery tech-nology.\nEarlier last month, Tesla held a shareholder event where they showcased a\nnew advancement in battery design\nthat reduced production costs by more\nthan 55%, thus making their cars more\naffordable. Another impressive feat is\nthe development of Aluminium-Air\n(Al-air) batteries, which promise more\nthan 2400Km in range; however, this\ntechnology is still being developed\nand researched by its inventor Trevor\nJackson, a former\nUK Royal Navy\nofficer,\nand\nhis investors.\nTrevor argues\nthat current lith-ium-based battery technology isn\u2019t\nsustainable since the production of\nemissions has shifted from vehicles to\npower stations. It\u2019s also worth noting\nthat by 2030, most of the discharged Liion batteries would end up as waste, out\nof which only around 5% are recycled.\nAluminium, on the other hand, is the\nmost abundant metal on our planet and\ncan be heavily recycled.\nMany studies have considered the\nlimitations of current battery technology and experimented with alternate\nmaterials (such as the Al-air battery\nmentioned above). Results from\nthese studies have showcased\nbattery designs that increase\nefficiency with faster charge\ncycles, safety with stable\ncomponents, and sustainability with durable and\nhighly recyclable ele-ments. It takes time for\ncutting-edge research\nwork to translate down\ninto the consumer\nspace. As mentioned\nby Elon Musk, setting up\na manufacturing facility is\nmore challenging than designing the actual car; this analogy applies\nto battery technology as well. However,\nthe future indeed looks promising, both\nfor us and for our environment.\n2400km range to be reached by\nfuture electric vehicles\nTest & trace data\nbeing sold by\nprivate firms:\nprepare yourself\nfor spam calls &\nmessages\nThe UK Government states that\ncontact tracing information is used\nonly for the NHS test and trace scheme\nand maintained for 21 days.

I do\nnot wish to share what you are about to read from\nanything resembling a place of authority. As a white\nguy coming from a tiny European\ncountry with very little ethnic di-versity, my education on race re-lations, racism, and what it means\nto come from a place of privilege\nwill be lifelong.\nWhat I want to do, is share\nwith you the experience I have\nhad puzzling together some of\nthe pieces, mostly musical, some\nliterary, some historical, that I\nhave come to understand as indispensable building blocks of one\nof the most intriguing and life-af-firming philosophical movements I have ever come across. I\nwant to show you how learning\nabout Afrofuturism helped me\nmake sense not only of the music\nthat I love, but also some of the social dynamics that I\nwill never be able to understand first-hand.\nMy first glimpse of ideas related to Afrofuturism, al-thoughnotexplicitly,cameintheshapeofabook,MarlonJames\u2019brilliantABriefHistoryofSevenKillings.It\nis a tale of the bloody backdrop of Kingston, Jamaica\nfrom which sprang forth the\nworldwide icon Bob Marley, only referred to in the\nstory as \u2018The Singer\u2019. What\nI remember wondering at\nwere the regular references\nto a \u2018return to Africa\u2019, a \u2018return home\u2019. Back then this\nespecially seemed foreign to\nme \u2013 I did not understand\nthe brutal reality of the displacement of millions of Africans during colonial times,\nand the effect this had on\nthe subsequent generations.\nThis sort of pan-African\nthinking, as I would later\nlearn, is a very important\naspect of the Rastafarian\nideology, which considers\nrepatriation to Africa an\nideal. But it turns out that\nthe reestablishment of a\nspiritual connection with\nAfrica, most crucially its pre-colonial cultural heritage,\nis a common theme in Afrofuturism as well. A very vivid illustration of this notion is recognisable in the most\nprominent example of Afrofuturism today, perhaps\never \u2013 the superhero film Black Panther. Its protago-nist, first appearing in comic books\ntowards the tail end of the civil rights\nmovement, embodies the pillars of\nAfrofuturism: pride, justice, progress,\nand a unique and all-encompassing\nAfrican spirit.\nA more ubiquitous clue for finding\nsuchconnectionstothepastinartcan\nbe found everywhere we look. If there\nwas one thing that I learned from my\nsaxophone teacher, it was the importance of black people, especially black\nAmericans, for modern music. Many\nof the complexities, both rhythmic\nand melodic, of Jazz and Blues were\ncompletely revolutionary and foreign\nto the European musical tradition.\nTrickling down through the centuries\nof slavery and oppression, it is a wonder they even survived, yet they set the course for how\nmusic would develop in the 20th century.\nIn my opinion, the best words for this need to\nreconnect with a collective future stolen from Africans centuries ago, come from the man who coined\nthe term himself, Mark Dery. He asks how \u201ca community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out\n\u2026 [can] imagine possible futures?\u201d. This closes the\ncircle of time,\nillustrating\nthe inherently positivis-tic nature of\nAfrofuturistic thought.\nIt does not\nconcern itself\nwith only the\npast or the future in isola-tion, but aims\nto encompass\nelements of\nthem both,\nalong with\nthe some-times-harsh\nrealities of\nthe present, to\nimagine a better world for black communities.\nEmma Dabiri, the Nigerian-Irish author, emphasizes the same ideals of Afrofuturism. She relates\nthem to the Oriki form of poetry, a form of expression for Yoruba speakers\nin Western Africa. In her\nBBC radio 4 episode, titled\nJourneys in Afrofuturism,\nshe claims that \u201cmuch of\n[Oriki\u2019s] power lies in its\nability to collapse concrete\ndistinctions between past,\npresent, and future\u201d. It is a\nbeautiful analogy, and one\nwhich explains why Afrofuturist art is so eclectic. If\nwe take Jazz and Blues to\nbe the gift of African tradition passed down through\ncenturies of oppression,\nthis particular musical\ncircle of time is closed by\nJimmy Hendrixplugging\nin his electric guitar and\nproducing the kinds of\nspace-age psychedelic explorations that no guitar\nplayer had managed be-fore.\nIt was an obsession with\nHOW CAN A\nCOMMUNITY\nWHOSE PAST\nHAS BEEN\nDELIBERATELY\nRUBBED OUT\n\u2026 IMAGINE\nPOSSIBLE\nFUTURES?\n\u201c IN SO MANY\nIMAGININGS OF\nTHE FUTURE,\nIN SO MUCH\nSCIENCE\nFICTION, THERE\nWERE NO BLACK\nPEOPLE AT\nALL\u2014WHICH [\u2026]\nMAKES NO SENSE\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Derek Langille\nMartin Flerin Music Editor\n\n"

Questions\ncovered topics including river deltas, art,\nAtlanta based hip-hop and the bones of\nthe human body.\nThe two teams started out equally,\neach team getting a starter question but\nStrathclyde soon pulled away, claiming\nstarter question after question until they\nhad an imposing lead of over 100 points.\nA late rally by the Imperial team was not\nenough to close the gap however and\nthe programme ended with the Imperial\nteam on 155 and the Strathclyde team\non 190.\nThe two teams had a major difference\nin ages. The average age of the Imperial\nteam was 19 and all the\nteam were undergraduates while the Strathclyde\nteam included three post-grads and had an average\nage of 29.\nWe then moved on to\ntalking about how Michael had himself got into\nquizzing.

Michael explained how each\nmember of the team\nhad an area of expertise\nthat they cultivated in\norder to complement\nthe team as a whole.\nThe specialisations are\nas follows : Justin Wong\n- history & geography,\nKatie Marrowword-based questions,\nthe natural world and\nwhat Michael referred\nto as \u201cweird shit\u201d (Ka-tie being the only member of the team to get\na question right in a\nround about the names\nof different types of\nwindows), Michael\nKohn - literature and fine arts and Imran\nRahman - social sciences, films, classical\nmusic.\nMicheal explained that the team\ntrained hard for the competition by\ntrawling through Wikipedia, practising by watching old rounds and seeing\nif they could buzz in before the people\non the screen and curating flashcard lists\non Anki, an app often used by medics\nto remember drug names and anatomy.\nWhen I asked if he would be willing to\nshare these lists with students, he politely refused saying that \u201ccurating and\ncreating these lists is the most important\npart of the process\u201d.\nFRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nNEWS\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nDO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET\nImperial team battle to stay in University challenge\n1st\nin the country last\nyear.

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH FEBRUARY 2020\n39\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nWhat follows is a few questions I put\nto one of imperials most high performing athlete, Christy Chan, who recently\nbecame a GB athlete in two very different sports:\nWho are you?\nHi everyone! I\u2019m Christy, a third\nyear EIE undergraduate. I\u2019m from\nHong Kong, and went to an International school there, Hong Kong International School. When I was thirteen,\nI moved to the UK to attend boarding\nschool, Sevenoaks School. However, I\ndisliked boarding at the school so became a day pupil shortly after. I compete\nin two sports, target rifle shooting and\npowerlifting. In target rifle shooting, I\ncompete in two disciplines, smallbore\nand fullbore. I was recently selected to\ncompete for Great Britain in the Drew\nMatch, an international smallbore prone\nrifle competition for U21\u2019s. This year, in\nfullbore, I won the Young Rifleman\u2019s Aggregate (best scores for my class at 300\nyards, 500 yards, and 600 yards). In pow-erlifting, I was also recently selected to\ncompete for Great Britain in the World\nJunior Bench Press Championships, in\nthe u52kg category, but this fell through\ndue to COVID.\nWhat\u2019s your sport background?\nI started shooting when I was thirteen\nat Sevenoaks, as a hobby and as something to fill time and to distract me from\nbeing homesick. I did this once a week\nfor two years, until year eleven, where I\nchose it as my \u2018sports option\u2019 meaning I\ndid it three or more times a week. I was\npretty bad at shooting for the first four\nyears, until in my final year of school, it\nall just clicked, and I suddenly got much\nbetter, being selected for England in the\nSchools\u2019 match.\nWhen I joined Imperial, using the\nfacilities provided by Imperial College\nRifle & Pistol Club, I used the knowledge I acquired over the past few years\ntotryandimprovewithoutanycoaching\nor help, which was difficult, but I per-severed! In my first year, I came 6th in\nfemale BUCS short\nrange, and last year\nI came 2nd beating\nsome GB shots as\nwell! In my last year\nof school, I needed\nsomething to fill in\nthe time during my\nfree periods. Instead\nof spending all of my\ntime at the shooting\nrange, I decided to go\nto the gym \u2013 it was\nnothing serious until\nI joined ICBarbell at\nuniversity. In second\nyear, I continued powerlifting, and with\nthe support of my coach and ICBarbell,\nI was able to make progress, competing\nin my first competition in January 2020,\nqualifying for British Junior Nationals,\nand National Bench Press Championships. I competed in the bench press\nchampionships in February 2020, came\n2nd in my weight class, and was subsequently selected for GB!\nHow do you balance university and\nsport?\nTo be perfectly honest with you, I\ndon\u2019t know. I meticulously plan my time\nand try to stay organized and on top of\nthings. I do tend to wake up at a decent\ntime, and just get grinding away at work/\ntraining.\nHave you ever experienced racism\nor sexism in the world of sport?\nIn powerlifting, in\nshort, no. ICBarbell is\na super diverse club, we\nhave a 60% female com-mittee! I am super glad\nto see this, and the fact\nthat we have come so far\nas a new club (founded\nin 2016), to the extent\nwhere I have never experienced racism or sexism\nin powerlifting.\nIn shooting, it\u2019s a different story. People in\nthe sport tend to come\nfrom private school\nbackgrounds, so everyone in the sport\ntends to be posh, white, and mostly\nmale. Smallbore more so than fullbore;\nlast year in the National Smallbore Rifle\nAssociation\u2019s Bisley Meeting, I was the\nonly person of colour on camp, and was\nsubsequently interviewed for their vid-eo!\nSaying this, I have not not felt welcomed \u2013 there are just a few times where\nthe odd racist joke or comment comes\nout, without a modern-day filter! In\nfullbore, although the majority are as\nI described above, there\u2019s a lot more\ndiversity. The people around are very\nsupportive and always willing to help,\nand racism/sexism is very much less of\na thing than you would expect! However, I must add that being a female in\ntwo male dominated sports is quite chal-lenging. You have to assert yourself, otherwise you\u2019ll be forgotten and trampled\nover! As long as you act confidently, you\nshould be perfectly fine!\nHow has COVID affected your life?\nIn March, when things started getting\nworse with COVID, I flew back home\nto Hong Kong. Just prior to this, I was\nstill entered into some competitions, so\ndecided to shoot all of them in one day.\nHere, in the midst of all the stress, I was\nsexually assaulted by a coach at the time.\nI said nothing and finished my shooting,\nbecause I had a flight to catch in 4 hours.\nIt severely impacted me and I underwent\ntherapy to try and overcome this. I am\nin the process of recovering. Gun laws\nin Hong Kong are extremely strict, so I\nwasn\u2019t able to shoot. During my mandatory 14 day home quarantineI thought I\ncould just wait and come back to training at the gym , however the gyms closed\ndue to a second wave! I had to make do\nwith a pull up bar and some resistance\nbands, but needless to say, I lost a lot of\nstrength.\nWhen the gyms reopened again in\nApril, I went hard, and nearly injured\nmyself squatting. I kept going at it\nthough, set a new PB, and then the gyms\nclosed again (third wave). The gyms\nwere closed until I came back to the UK\nat the beginning of September, for some\nImperial star athlete selected to represent\nGreat Britain in two different sports\nSports Editor Konrad Hohendorf\nI DO TEND TO\nWAKE UP AT A\nDECENT TIME,\nAND JUST GET\nGRINDING\nAWAY AT WORK/\nTRAINING.\n\u201c Christy Chan collecting her trophy for the\nYoung Rifleman\u2019s Aggregate\nChristy Chan (second women from left) with ICBarbell\n\n"

In the case of Afrofuturism, it was a striving for equality, for due recog-nition, and for\nthe ability to\nimagine a black\nfuture. This aspect - the power\nof imagination,\nis one that is\nemphasized by\nmost experts on\nthe topic. Initially, it came\nfrom a concrete\nlack of black\nsuperheroes in\nsci-fi. No one\ncould deny the\nfact that the visions of gleaming skyscrapers\nand flying cars,\nfantasies inherited from early\n20th century futurists and only\nemboldened by\nthe rise of Hollywood, were\nbeing constructed by white people, for white people.\nDery\u2019s essay Black To the Future, first published in\nthe early 90s, lists many concrete pieces of evidence\nof this absence, and points out the consequences of\nthis dearth. In the episode 623 of the podcast and\nradio program This American\nLife, hosts Neil Drumming and\nIra Glass describe the conundrum\nquite well.\nIG:\u201cAnd for so long, in so many\nimaginings of the future, in so\nmuch science fiction, there were\nno black people at all\u2014which [\u2026]\nmakes no sense.\u201d\nND: \u201c[Afrofuturism] imagines\nthat [\u2026] black people have forms\nof survival through, you know, the\nslave trade, through persecution,\nthat that\u2019s almost a technology\nin itself, the ways in which we\u2019ve\ncome through those things.\u201d\nBefore transitioning to the music of it all, I feel it necessary to set\nthe scene, to put a firm pin in the\npresent which ties it all together.\nThat scene is Detroit, Michigan,\nthe birthplace of so many genres of\nmusic it is getting hard to count. It\nis also currently a prime example of a city being left\nbehind in post-industrial America. At times, it can\nseem post-apocalyptic. This was the soil on which\nmany of the different iterations of musical Afrofuturism have thrived over the years. For a perfect encapsulation of all these eras, past and present, have\na look at\nS q u a r e -p u s h e r \u2019s\nrecent music video\nfor Detroit People Mover.\nThe eery\nemptiness\nof the ear-ly-Covid\nera it was\nshot in\nwill surely help in\nachieving\nthe right\nmood for\nr e a d i n g\non.\nA couple of\nyears ago,\na friend\nc a m e\nupon the\nstrangely titled artist The Other People Place, whose\nonly LP, Lifestyles of the Laptop Caf\u00e9, had a uniquely minimalist groove, all the while maintaining a\nsharp percussive edge. It could have come from no\nother place than D-town itself. It turned out that this\nalbum was the product of James\nStinson, who, up to his untimely\ndeath in 2002 following heart com-plications, had formed one half of\nthe late-90s electro duo Drexciya.\nTheir music was not only incredibly fascinating because of how the\nfuturistic bleeps and bangs sounded both palatable and unique (the\nway the 808\u2019s hungry snare bites\nthrough the melancholic Drexciyan pads is unmistakable), but also\nbecause of the song titles, which\nsuggested a lore bigger than the\nsongs themselves.\nAndreaen Sand Dunes, Bubble\nMetropolis and Under Sea Disturbances are all big Drexciyan hitters\nand all have peculiar names related to oceans. Drexciya operated\nin strictest secrecy, their identities\nhaving been concealed until Stinson\u2019s death, and released their music on Detroit\u2019s Underground Resistance label. In\nkeeping with the political edge of the label \u2013 implied\nby its name and solidified by the militant public personas of the founders\u2013 their songs are fast-paced, in\nyour face, and have a penchant for the dramatic (be-sides the aforementioned pads, imagine razor-sharp\nand/or wobbly basslines aplenty). But where do the\nnautical leanings come from?\nDrexciya imagined an alternative reality, where\nthe babies of pregnant women that had been thrown\noverboard from slave ships survived and learned to\nthrive underwater.

This decision came after anonymous\nCollege sources called academics \u201cjumped up, spoiled\nwastes of space\u201d. According to Christian Peeler, Vice\nProvost (Education), it was realised that as black-cab\ndrivers are experts in all topic of conversation they\nwere better value as generalists than the incredibly limited range of most academics.

    "content": "Nauman evokes raw discomfort\nAnthro / Socio (Rinde Spinning)\nCredits: Christoph Irrgan\nT\nhere are few things as eerie as a sinister spin\non child\u2019s play. Children, perceived to be the\nepitome of innocence by society, still untouched by the lures of lust and greed, should only\nbe seen as pure. Horror films such as the Exorcist,\nAnnabelle, Sinister and Hereditary (to name a few\n- the list really goes on forever) play on this eerie\nconcept of the darker side of childhood.\nNot knowing what to expect when I stepped\ninto Bruce Nauman\u2019s exhibition at Tate Modern, I\nam struck by a sinister feeling. Nauman, an American born in Indiana in the 40s, explores the human\nbody, play, discomfort, life and death in different\ncolours. Walking from room to room in the exhi-bition, feelings of unease are not uncommon. The\nuse of sound often penetrates from one room to the\nnext, so you\u2019ve already got an idea of what\u2019s waiting for you in the next room based on the wailing,\ncrying sounds or the grainy, loud background noise\ncreeping up on you. Much like Andy Warhol, the\nguy he shares the 4th floor of Tate with, Nauman\nsaw his studio as a place where art wasn\u2019t static or\neven a product of working. He rather saw it as a\nconstant dynamic creation, one that he as an artist\nwas constantly involved with.\nMuch of his art is in video format, but he was\nalso very talented at sculpting steel, fiberglass and\nneon. He explores children\u2019s play in much of his art,\nmaking references to musical chairs, playing with a\npack of cards and falling over like a cartoon character slipping on a banana in a slow-motion video.\nHis own description of his work \u2019Hanged man\u2019 is\na perfect example of\nhis harrowing take on\nchild\u2019s play: \u201dWith my\nversion... you\u2019re not\nallowed to participate\n- the parts of the figure\nare put into place without you\u201d (obviously\nreferencing the game\nHangman). I look\naround the exhibition\n- there are children\nrunning around, ahead\nof their parents, perplexed by the different\nworks.\nOther works are a\ndirect commentary\non society, and cover\ntopics such as impris-onment, surveillance\nand death. They engage the visitor in more than\njust a visual sense. The exhibition shows off Nauman\u2019s talent excellently, and the use of space is well\nthought out. For the first time in a while I walked\nout through the last door of the exhibition, disappointed not to be met with yet another room, but\ninstead the museum caf\u00e9.\nBruce Nauman @\nTate Modern\nUntil 21st\nFeb 2021\n\u00a325 (\u00a322 Students)\nReviewed by Amanda Hertzberg Arts Editor\nExhibtion\nJean Michel Jarr\u2019s virtual studio\nCredits: Imgur/Gil Lefauconnier\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n18\nAnd what about grime, drum & bass and garage,\nthree huge electronic genres endemic to London?\nVisitors are required to bring their own headphones to the exhibition, there is a lot of information that goes missed without them. They need to be\nwired as well, so no airpods unfortunately. Because\nof COVID-19 the museum is not able to lend out\nheadphones, which might make some parts of the\nexhibition inaccessible to some.\nI would\u2019ve also liked to see more of an attempt at\ninvolving the viewers in the exhibition. At times it\nfelt like reading a Wikipedia page about electronic\nmusic, but in physical form. However, there are a\nfew interactive pieces, and they are excellent. They\nare clearly what the exhibition has been built up\naround, and are kind of the few strong pillars holding up a rather weak roof. The audience that would\nenjoy this exhibition most, is the gen X, that grew\nup on the birth of electronic music, partying in the\n80s and 90s era of Eurodance music, who want to\nreminisce the good old times.\n\n"

    "content": "Environmental injustice in the UK\nprevents access to nature for all\nFRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nSUSTAINABILITY\n37\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSpending time in natural environments and forming connections\nwith other species is vital for our health\nand sustainability. However, in many\nurban areas of the world, finding time\nand space for these connections is\nnot accessible for all. Environmental\ninequality manifests itself in people\u2019s\naccess to green space, pollution risk and\nexposure to flood risk. According to a\nreview of past research, \u2018environmental injustice is a real and substantive\nproblem that afflicts many of our most\ndeprived and socially excluded groups\u2019,\nlikewise, a report by the Environment\nAgency states that people who are socially and economically disadvantaged\noften have less access to green space.\nA paper from DEFRA (Department\nof Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\nin the UK) states that exposure to the\nnatural environment is significantly\nlower in ethnic minorities populations\nand low-income populations compared\nto the rest of the population. Plus in\n2018, Natural England published a\nreport \u2018that 63% of the white British\npopulation visited green spaces weekly,\nwhile just 46% of the BAME British\npopulation visited green spaces at similar rates\u2019. Furthermore, a study by the\nForestry Commission highlighted that\none of the factors that prevent ethnic\nminority people from having equitable\naccess to woodlands is that they feel\n\u2018unwelcome and out of place\u2019.\nRacism in the outdoors and in environmental movements prevents ethnic\nminorities from accessing nature. Many\nwhite environmentalist organisations\ndo not care for inner-city environmental racism nor for ethnic minority\naccess to the countryside. Moreover, for\nenvironmental justice in the UK, it is\nnot just important to increase the number green spaces but also to consult\nwith local communities and support\ncommunity networks\nfor creating an action\nplan for a more sustainable city.\nRacism is an environmental issue.\nSusan Cutter defines\nenvironmental justice\nas \u2018Equal access to a\nclean environment and\nequal protection from\npossible environmental\nharm irrespective of\nrace, income, class, or\nother differentiating\nfeatures of socioeconomic status\u2019. Racism\ndictates which communities get worse\npollution, more exposure to harmful\nchemicals and proximity to waste-pro-cessing sites.\nIt is essential for white people,\nincluding myself, to remember that if\nyou are not actively anti-racist, you are\nmaintaining the status quo of white\nFlora Dickie Sustainability editor\nOUR INEQUALITY\nCRISIS IS\nINTERTWINED\nWITH THE CLIMATE\nCRISIS. IF WE DON\u2019T\nWORK ON BOTH,\nWE WILL SUCCEED\nAT NEITHER.\n\u201c\nsupremacy.\nMarine Biologist Dr\nAyana Johnson recently\nwrote in an\narticle, \u2018To\nthe white\npeople who\ncare about\nmaintaining\na habitable\nplanet, I\nneed you to\nbe actively\nanti-racist.\nI need you\nto understand that our inequality crisis\nis intertwined with the climate crisis. If\nwe don\u2019t work on both, we will succeed at neither\u2019. Therefore, any form of\nactivism, such as climate justice work,\nis not fulfilling its purpose if it doesn\u2019t\nhave anti-oppression and anti-racism at\nits core.\nAmid the current pandemic, there\nare countless tips and articles\nonline about how to cope and look after\nour health (mentally and physically).\nAlmost all of them include going out-side, but very few go into the details of\nwhy it\u2019s beneficial.\nIn \u2018The Nature Fix: Why Nature\nMakes Us Happier, Healthier, and\nMore Creative\u2019, Florence Williams goes\ninto incredible depth about the scientific benefits of spending time in nature,\nwhilst covering a wide breadth of topics\nto argue that nature is not a luxury, but\nrather, a necessity for humans to thrive.\nOne of the most remarkable features\nof this book is the sheer amount of\nscientific research and analysis that has\ngone into making the arguments for\nnature convincing. As someone who\nmajors in a science degree, it was so\nrefreshing to see the amount of concrete empirical evidence that Williams\nprovided. For example, when it comes\nto concepts such as \u2018forest-bathing\u2019 or\n\u2018eco-therapy\u2019, it can become all too easy\nfor people to dismiss it or deem them\nas hippy-related solutions that aren\u2019t\nbased on factual understand-ing. That\u2019s why this\nbook can hopefully\nencourage and inspire\nnot just those who\nneed a little push to\nget outside, but also\nfor those who are sceptical about the benefits\nnature can bring us.\nWhilst there is a lot\nof science inside it, the\nbook doesn\u2019t feel heavy\non the brain at all. Instead,\nWilliams somehow manages to seamlessly weave\ntogether facts with personal sentiments, descrip- tive\nnarratives, as well as specks of humour.\nFor example, there are several chapters\ndedicated to her experience of spending time in nature with PTSD and\nADHD patients. Her personal story\nof interacting with them and watching\nthem heal, speaks beyond\nfactual arguments to a\nmore profound innate\nhuman desire to get in\ntouch with nature as\na means of restoring\nour well-being. With\nthe global rise in\nmental health issues\nsuch as anxiety and\ndepression, it\u2019s\nclear to see how a\nfuture in which\npeople better\nappreciate na-ture, could bring\nabout a generation of more balanced,\nvibrant and engaging individuals.\nAnother aspect of the book that\nmade it compelling was how Williams\ngathered information and insights from\nall over the world to convey the universal and timeless value of nature. From\nstudies about forest-bathing in Japan, to\nthe Scandanavian concept of having free\naccess forests, by touching upon the different values that communities around\nthe world place on nature, it\u2019s clear to\nsee how nature is necessary for fostering\na planet of happy, healthy people.\nAs we all spend an increasing amount\nof time indoors, due to both the global\npandemic and our lifestyles being dominated by screens, it\u2019s even more vital for\nus to take time outside. The good part\nis, as Williams reassures us in the book,\nit doesn\u2019t mean we need to spend an\nentire week in the middle of nowhere\n(although that would be great too);\neven just little doses of nature whenever we can, is undoubtedly better than\nnothing.\n\u2018The Nature Fix\u2019 - Book Review\nMonami Miyamoto Sustainability editor\n\n"

The first\nlockdown was a sacrifice by the people\nto give this Government time to boost\nour historically underfunded healthcare\nsystem and to build a world leading test\nand trace system so that any new infections can be isolated before they spread\nfar, ideally keeping R below 1 and seeing\ndomestic transmission come to an end.\nYet the Government failed, outsourcing this by handing over \u00a310 billion\nin contracts to private firms such as\nDeloitte and Serco who have produced\na system that, according to the Government\u2019s own experts on SAGE, is experiencing delays so severe that the system\nis having only a \u201cmarginal impact\u201d on\ntransmission. The system was telling\nmany residents to drive hundreds of\nmiles to get a test, leaving those with\nsymptoms to either not get a test or to\nget tested privately, further exacerbating\nthe class divide caused by this pandemic.\nThe app that was released only a couple weeks ago has also had a variety of issues reported, from false alerts to a lack\nof information about local restrictions.\nIt isn\u2019t supported on older iPhones,\nalthough this is more due to how Apple\nand Google designed the API that facilitates the contact tracking.\nIn the end, despite massive amounts\nof goodwill from the public and healthcare workers, the Government has wasted billions from the public purse on a\ndysfunctional test and trace system, and\nwe are back at square one, staring down\nthe barrel of a second wave.\nThree weeks ago, SAGE recommended that universities move to online\nteaching where possible. Yet the Government ignored this and universities,\nincluding Imperial, continued to tell\nstudents about \u201cmixed learning\u201d. Students moved into halls believing that\nthey would get some level of in-person\nteaching as well, and in the past couple\nweeks we have seen the largest outbreaks\ntake place in student halls. Official case\nnumbers have now overtaken those of\nthe first wave, and statistics imply that\nthese are being driven particularly by the\n16-29 age group.\nIn response, the Government has\ninstituted a localised three tier system\nof restrictions, with the Liverpool city\nregion being placed under the highest\ntier of restrictions. Yet experts, both\nindependent and on SAGE, say these\nmeasures do not go far enough. They,\nalong with the Leader of the Opposition, have demanded a national \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d lockdown to stop the epidemic\nspiralling out of control.\nA second lockdown was not inevi-table. It could\u2019ve been avoided with a\nfunctioning test and trace system. Yet\nthe Government\u2019s failure to learn from\nthe lessons of the first wave means that\nit is the only option left to us in order\nto save lives. Except this time, when we\nemerge from the other side of lockdown,\nwe need to have test and trace.\nCONTINUED\nElon Musk\u2019s Starlink \u201cmega-constellation\u201d and\nthe impact of the commercial use of space Photo credits: Starlink\nPhoto credits: John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation\nLiving in London, it is hard to\nimagine a world without internet\nconnection. Most of us groan at the\nrare sight of our mobile data switching\nfrom 4G to 3G, and we even have Wi-Fi\nat our tube stations. But in 2018, the\nGlobal System for Mobile Communications reported that 10% of the world\u2019s\npopulation lived beyond the reach of a\nmobile network, and an additional 3%\ndo not have access to adequate broadband speeds. That translates to around\n1 billion people living without adequate\ninternet coverage.\nThis is a problem in our increasingly online world, where more of us\nare working from home than ever and\nmany children require internet access\nto complete their schoolwork. In 2017,\nthe Imperial Business School published\na study showing that a 10% increase in\nmobile broadband leads to an increase\nin GDP of 0.6-2.8%.\nSo a network of potentially 42,000\nmini satellites providing high-speed\ninternet to the entire planet sounds\nlike a great idea, right? That is the end\ngoal of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Starlink\nprogramme, which began in May 2019\nwith the launch of 60 small satellites\nfrom a single rocket. As of right now,\nthere are almost 800 Starlink satellites\norbiting the Earth.\nThere are several issues with this\nambitious plan. For starters, the\ninternet coverage will come at a cost\nto users. Depending on the cost, it is\nlikely that this will limit the number of additional internet users\nthat the programme can actually\nbring in, as areas without proper\ninternet access are generally in\nless privileged communities.\nOn top of this, satellites do\nnot last forever, and we are\nfacing an increasing problem of \u201cspace junk\u201d as more\nsatellites become non-op-erational. Even if SpaceX\u2019s\nsatellites last for\ncenturies, their\n\u201cmega-constellation\u201d will still be\nleaving future generations with an additional\n42,000 pieces of space junk to\ndeal with.\nMany astronomers have also expressed great concern about the impact\nthat the programme will\nhave on astronomy\nresearch. At the\nmoment, if you\nspend a few hours\nlooking at the night\nsky, you will see several satellites moving\namongst the many stars.\nBut the stars we can\nsee with the naked eye\ncurrently significantly\noutnumber satellites, and\nastronomers researching our\nuniverse can correct for the\nmarks left by a satellite or\ntwo in their images and data.\nRemoving thousands of\nsatellites from a set of data is\nless easy, and a lot more time\nconsuming. You only have to\nlook at images that have been\ninterrupted by the Starlink\nsatellites already orbiting to understand the potential disruption that\ntens of thousands of satellites could\ncause to research.\nRadioastronomers have also voiced\nconcerns about Starlink satellites. The\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA), an international telescope project which will\nbecome the world\u2019s largest radio observatory once complete, has highlighted\nthe issue that these satellites will require\nthe use of a wider range of frequencies.\nThis will reduce the bandwidth available\nto radioastronomers studying the sky.\nThe band that Starlink uses takes up\nfrequencies of 10.7 to 12.7 gigahertz,\nwithin a range known as band 5b. This\nis one of the seven bands SKA\u2019s satellite\ndishes aim to target. This is based on\nSKA analysis which calculated the impact of 6400 satellites, so it is likely that\nthe planned 42,000 Starlink satellites\ncould have an even worse impact.\nAnd it is not just researchers who will\nbe impacted. Those of us who do not\nhave access to a telescope might soon be\nlooking up at a sky dominated by satellites rather than stars. The reflection of\nsunlight from the satellites will increase\nlight pollution and reduce the number\nof stars visible to the naked eye. The\nnight sky, a near constant throughout\nhuman history, might never be the same\nagain.\nLily Shepherd Science Writer\nROUND TWO\n\n"

Championing a black woman with an afro on a cosmic\nblack background, it seems rather like a nod to the\ncover of Funkadelic\u2019s Maggot Brain and its master-mind, George Clinton.\nBoth were crucial in the development of the Afrofuturist aesthetic.\nSun Ra and his Arkestra regularly performed in an eccentric mix\nof ancient Egyptian and space age\nclothing, whereas Funkadelic (along\nwith Parliament, the other half of\nClinton\u2019s futuristic collective) championed cover art and outfits can\nonly be described as space cowboy\nfashion. Boots, leather, and denim,\nas well as face paint and brightly\ncoloured futuristic accessories all\ncombined to emphasize the psychedelic sounds.\nThe philosophy of Sun Ra is rather complex, even bordering on neb-ulous, but it is a single quote that, to\nme, most powerfully elucidates the\nrole of the present day in Afrofuturism. It comes\nfrom the 1974 film called Space is the Place, where\nhe announces, \u201cI do not come to you as a reality, I\ncome to you as the myth because that\u2019s what black\npeople are, myths.\u201d To this I add the epic opening\nlines from Maggot Brain \u2013 \u201cMother earth is pregnant for the third time // For y\u2019all have knocked her\nup // I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the\nuniverse// I was not offended //\nFor I knew I had to rise above it\nall // Or drown in my own shit\u201d.\nNo words could illustrate the\ndisillusionment of marginaliza-tion better. But they did not stop\nat mere words. Sun Ra\u2019s spirit of\njazz experimentation\nstill echoes\nt h r o u g h\nmuch of\nm o d e r n\nh i p - h o p\nand electronic mu-sic, while\nhis visual\na e s t h e t i c\nkeeps on\nresurrecting itself,\nwith Janelle\nM o n a e \u2019 s\ncover art\nfor ArchAndroid seeming particularly\ninfluenced by it. George Clinton\u2019s and P-Funk\u2019s legacy in Detroit, meanwhile, still soldiers\non. Clinton himself might have\nmoved on to other things, but the\nspirit of Parliament/Funkadelic\nwas revitalized in the 80s by the\npioneers of Electro Funk,\nwhich was incredibly influential in the development of\ntechno.\nAnd so, we have arrived\nback to Detroit, the city\nwhich could be called the\nMecca of all modern black\nmusic. We have closed the\ncircle of time, in the way\nof Oriki. There is much to\nlearn from Afrofuturism,\nand even more to marvel\nat. I hope that you, like\nme, will use this article as\na platform to learn more\nabout it. Any and all of\nthe artists in the article\nare a good place to start\nbut I\u2019m quite confident\nthat you can now identify many examples of your\nown who exhibit the same\nmentality. In the end, the\ncommon element is the\ndrive to dream of a bet-ter, equally representative\nfuture for all people. Is that not a dream we\nshould all share\nAND SO, WE HAVE\nARRIVED BACK\nTO DETROIT,\nTHE CITY\nWHICH COULD\nBE CALLED THE\nMECCA OF ALL\nMODERN BLACK\nMUSIC\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Westbound Records\nPhoto credits: Axis Records\nPhoto credits: Tobias Akerboom\nCONTINUED\n\n"

So far so Sandler.\nThen Steve Buscemi shows up\u2014to mar the great career\nhe\u2019s had\u2014playing a polite, self-loathing werewolf who\nhas escaped from the \u201cwerewolf\ninstitution[?]\u201d and is being tracked\nby a Mike Myers parody who\nenjoys pissing in the street (I\u2019m not\nmaking this up). Then Shaquille\nO\u2019Neal shows up, doing a woman\u2019s\nvoice, and proceeds to eat a sandwich \u00e0 la Lady and the Tramp with\na woman who has a man\u2019s voice.\nIt\u2019s at this point that the viewer has\na decision to make: embrace the\npoorly written plot for the slice\nof fun that it is, or become deeply\ndepressed at the state of modern\ncinema, perhaps even some people\nwill manage both. The former,\nthough sacrilegious, at least gets you\nthrough to the end of the film. I can\nthink of only two groups of people\nthis will appeal to: the first is children,\nand the second group is that subset of\nadults who can see that it\u2019s crap, and\nyet are still good-spirited enough to\ntry and see the funny side. It isn\u2019t a\ngood film, nor is it especially funny,\nhence its abysmal rating. But it will inevitably find its place, five Halloweens\nfrom now, on those nights where the\npizzas are ordered, and any film will\ndo, and the familiar, albeit annoying\ngrin of Adam Sandler beckons from\nthe screen.\nSandler\u2019s Latest Horror Show\nSaint Maud: A Devilish Debut Feature\nReviews\nOne of the most popular devices\nused by horror directors of late is\nthat of possession. Such a theme is often displayed through the process of an\n\u2018other\u2019 taking hold of an innocent host\nto go about its sordid business. This\nidea can of course be executed with\nvarying levels of success. We see it fail\nmiserably in money-grabbers like The\nConjuring and The Nun, but also see it\nsucceed in genuinely good horror movies like Ari Aster\u2019s Hereditary. As in\nthose mentioned, the possession usually takes place\nin a religious or cult context, though it is not in\nitself ever religious. The unlucky host often has no\nconscious agency, having totally succumbed to the\nspirit or devil possessing them. Until Rose Glass\u2019s\ndebut feature Saint Maud, I had not been aware\nas to just how unsettling a movie can be when the\nagency is returned to the host, when the religious\npossession is entirely ideological, self-driven, delu-sional. In many ways, this possession is more unsettling than the more common demonic possessions.\nA spirit can always leave, and in doing so can return the person back to rationality. But if they have\nbeen possessed by an idea, as opposed to a spirit or\nethereal force, what can they return to? What can\nsave them?\nThe role of Maud\u2014a young nurse who cares for\nthe terminally ill, and who is on the verge of a very\npersonal, life-consuming, religious epiphany\u2014is no\neasy task. However, Morfydd Clark (who recently\nfeatured in The Personal History of David Copperfield) gives a beautifully balanced performance. She\ngives us enough insight into her mind that we feel\nher downward spiral, yet she\nkeeps enough cards close to\nher chest that we do not\nknow how far she\u2019ll fall.\nJennifer Ehle\u2014formally Myrtle Logue in The\nKing\u2019s Speech, and Jessica\nin Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s Zero\nDark Thirty\u2014is dangerously playful in the role of\nAmanda, Maud\u2019s newest\npatient and target of con-version. Although Saint Maud is reminiscent of a\nstandard horror movie in the beginning, its tone\nshifts slightly when Maud questions her faith. As\nMaud looks to sex and alcohol to mend her polar-ising psyche, the film bears striking resemblences\nto Julia Ducournau\u2019s exhilarating 2016 film Raw.\nBoth Raw and Saint Maud are about a possessed\nyoung woman who tries to shake her obsession\nthrough delving into the \u2018dark side\u2019, who feels anger towards a more hedonistic older woman, and\nwho ultimately is unable to help herself. However,\ndespite the themes of possession and psychological\ndegeneration, Saint Maud, like Raw, is ultimately\nabout loneliness.\nThe bleak coastal town where Maud lives, and\nthe isolated house on the hill where she cares for\nAmanda, emphasise just how alone and far from\nnormalcy she has become. The soundtrack, consisting of drawn out notes and barking cellos, comes\nand goes but is very effective in setting an eerie tone.\nAlthough only 80 minutes, the ending does not feel\npremature\u2014it is assured and superbly abrupt, with\na final shot that will haunt you on your way home.\nThe horror we\u2019re used to will undoubtedly mislead\npeople\u2019s expectations going into this one. I\u2019d advise\nyou to leave your desire for a scare-fest at the cinema doors and embrace the character study, you will\nnot be disappointed.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nDirectedby: Steven Brill\nStarring: Adam Sandler; Kevin James; Julie\nBowen; Ray Liotta; Steve Buscemi; Rob Sneider\nStudio: Happy Madison Productions\nHubie Halloween\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n26\nSaint Maud\nDirectedby: Rose Glass\nStarring: Morfydd Clark; Jessica Ehle\nStudio: Film4 Productions; BFI Film Fund; BFI; Escape\nPlan Productions; A24\nTHE FINAL SHOT\nWILL HAUNT\nYOU ON YOUR\nWAY HOME\n\u201c\nSource: IMP Awards/Netflix\nSource: A24 Films\n\n"

The vast majority\nof the country, including London, is\ncurrently under this category.\nHigh level restrictions (orange) ban\nall indoor household mixing with the\nrule of six still applying outdoors. This\napplies to areas in the North East and\nNorth West of England, such as the\nManchester city region, Newcastle, and\nDurham.\nVery high level restrictions (red) demand the\nclosure of hospitality\nand entertainment\nvenues that don\u2019t\nserve food, as\nwell as\nhousehold mixing in private outdoor\nspaces, such as gardens. It is notable\nthat these highest level restrictions\nare still less strict than the original\nlockdown conditions.\nAs of Wednesday, the very\nhigh restrictions apply only to\nthe Liverpool city region.\nAs Scotland, Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland are devolved nations, different systems of\nrestrictions\napply to\nthem.\nPhoto credits: Election Maps UK\nLast minute\nLondon update\nOn Wednesday morning it was announced that local leaders of Greater\nManchester and Lancashire were in\ntalks with the Government that may see\nthose regions move up to the \u2018Very high\u2019\nrestrictions, while London and Essex are\nconfirmed to be moving up to the \u2018High\u2019\nrestrictions.

    "content": "FRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSCIENCE\nGenetically driven diseases encompass a wide variety of illnesses\nand, in addition to genetic disorders,\ninclude some of the world\u2019s most lethal\nkillers, such as diabetes or cancer. These\noccur when a specific region of DNA\nis deleted, replicated, or exchanged,\nleading to mutations and faulty protein\nproduction. While these mutations are\nfrequently inherited, they can also arise\nspontaneously later in life, such as in\nmost types of cancer.\nAdvanced therapies, including gene\ntherapies, aim to treat or prevent genetic diseases by addressing the underlying cause: faulty DNA code. For\nexample, gene-based therapeutics can\nbe introduced to inactivate or \u2018silence\u2019\nfaulty genes, or conversely to stimulate\nexpression of correctly functioning ones\nto amplify their effect. Genes can also\nbe modified or reprogrammed, either\nwithin the patient or in vitro, to provide\ncorrectly functioning proteins.\nThe type of appropriate therapy will\ndepend on the individual\u2019s genetic composition and stage at which the genetic\nmutation occurs, and so is highly tailored to the patient. This illustrates the\nconcept of personalised medicine - and\nsignals a move away from the current,\nmore generalised, medication approach.\nRNA, despite being known primarily\nfor its role in protein synthesis, is a particularly effective gene therapeutic. Due\nto its diverse biological functions, if\nengineered correctly, it encounters significantly less obstacles when entering\nour cells than synthetic drugs, and has\nless potential for toxic side-effects than,\nfor example, viral vectors, which can\nrisk unwanted mutations or immune\nhyper-reactions. Moreover, small nucleotide changes can be easily made to\nadjust the RNA\u2019s functions within the\ncell, simultaneously achieving a more\ntargeted and versatile mode of action\nthan currently used treatments. It is also\nincreasingly easier and cost-effective to\nmanufacture than more complicated\nalternatives, such as immunotherapies.\nA currently popular method which\nemploys RNA is CRISPR-Cas9, where\na pre-designed targeting guide RNA\n(gRNA) sequence is embedded within a longer RNA strand (yes, it is this\nmechanism which was the basis of this\nyear\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry!). The\nCRISPR-Cas9 complex, guided by\nthe gRNA, binds to a specific DNA\nsequence inside the patient\u2019s cells, and\nthe Cas 9 enzyme acts to cut the DNA\nat this location. This triggers the cell\nto recognise that DNA damage has\noccurred and activate its own repair\nmachinery to add, replace, or delete a\ngene fragment - such as a piece of faulty\ngenetic code. CRISPR itself is extremely versatile and has high potential for\na plethora of genetic diseases, but it is\nnot yet widespread for human use, as\noff-target effects and other limitations\nare still being eliminated via early-stage\nstudies. However, one current experimental focus is attempting to cure Huntington\u2019s disease in humans, a genetic\ndisease classified by additional, repeated\nsegments of genetic code that cause\ndeformation of the subsequently generated protein, which disrupts the functioning of neuron cells. Use of CRISPR\ngene editing tools aim to remove the\nsurplus repeats to prevent escalation of\nthe disease.\nAlthough the most high-profile, RNA\ngene therapies are not limited to CRISPR tools. A type of RNA known as\nmRNA (messenger RNA) can be used,\nfocusing on replacing a patient\u2019s faulty\nmRNA, such as in cystic fibrosis, a\ndisease that occurs as a result of the mutated CFTR protein. mRNA is a form\nof RNA which acts as the connection\nbetween protein expression and raw\nDNA code, and so delivering healthy\nmRNA to the patient could correct an\nunderlying genetic disorder. Candidate\ndrugs of this type involving inhalation\nof nanoparticles containing healthy\nmRNA to help replace the faulty CFTR\nprotein are currently being developed\nby TranslateBio and Moderna Therapeutics, among others.\nmRNA can also be used to develop\nvaccines; one of the leading vaccines\nbeing developed against COVID-19 is\nof this type and is being developed by\nModerna Therapeutics. Injected mRNA\ncan be translated into proteins by our\nown cell machinery to stimulate the\nimmune system to produce a specific response against a pathogen such against\nthe flu, Zika or rabies viruses. Specific\ncancer biomarkers, called neoepitopes,\ncan also be targeted using mRNA, such\nas for melanoma treatment.\nFinally, an RNA therapy focused\non degrading faulty proteins, termed\nantisense therapy, is on the rise and\nis currently more prominent than\nmRNA due to its ease of manufacture.\nThis primarily uses a type of RNA\nknown as interfering RNA (RNAi, or\nsiRNA - short interfering RNA), and\nwas the basis of the 2006 Nobel Prize\nin Physiology/Medicine. These short\nRNAs carry instructions for the cell\nto destroy particular malfunctioning\nmRNAs within itself. Again, this is\ngaining traction with therapies to\ntreat haemophilia and improve kidney\ntransplant outcomes, which are already\nbeing used, while multiple others are in\nclinical trials. In 2018, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals launched the first approved\nsiRNA drug to treat a rare degenerative\ndisorder called hereditary ATTR amy-loidosis. Their drug, patisiran, is either\ninjected or administered intravenously,\nand exhibits its effects in the liver; as\ndo most candidate drugs at this point\nin time. Since then, however, only one\nother siRNA drug has been approved;\nbut several others are showing promise\nin late-stage clinical trials.\nRNA-based therapies hold immense\npotential, but the answer to the key\nlimitation - the lack of efficient drug\ndelivery systems which can target organs other than the liver - is the primary\nfocus in the field. With further research\nand investment into the sector, RNAbased therapies appear to be the basis of\nthe next pharmaceutical revolution, and\na solid step towards curing what was\nonce thought to be the incurable.\nWhy RNA may be the answer to curing\ngenetic (and other) diseases\nJulia Dabrowska Science Editor\nMicroscope image of the mRNA vaccine candidate being developed by Moderna Therapeutics\nPhoto credits: Flickr.\nRNA THERAPIES\nSIMULTANEOUSLY\nACHIEVE A MORE\nTARGETED AND\nVERSATILE MODE\nOF ACTION THAN\nCURRENTLY-USED\nTREATMENTS\n\u201c\n\n"

So, when I missed the\nticket sale for Spector playing a small,\nsocially distanced gig to celebrate DIY\nmagazine\u2019s 100th issue, only to find out\nmy friend had got me a ticket, the dopamine rush was pretty sweet.\nSpector are one of the bands that\nsoundtracked my\nteenage life, and to\nbe honest, they probably still do. Even\nthough they haven\u2019t\nreleased an album in\n5years,thebandhave\ncome out with some\nof their best songs to\ndate through three\nEPs in the last two\nyears, and released a\ncompilation album\nof these EPs titled\n\u2018Non-Fiction\u2019 on vinyl on April 29th\nthis year. Frontman\nFred Macpherson\nhas cemented himself as one of the\nmost criminally underrated lyricists in\nsongs like \u2018Untitled in D\u2019 and \u2018Half Life\u2019,\nwhere he sings over catchy synth riffs\nabout the anxiety surrounding life in the\ndigital-age. There could not have been a\nbetter band to see for a first post-lock-down gig.\nMy first socially\ndistanced gig was\nreminiscent of my\nfirst standing gig as\na teenager - feeling\na bit awkward whilst\nnot being quite sure\nhow you should\ndance or what you\nshould do with your\narms. This feeling\nwas clearly shared,\nwith Macpherson\nremarking, \u201cstop\npretending like you\ndidn\u2019t wake up at\n8am to be in the\nonly 75 people here,\u201d\nat the lack of socially\ndistanced dancing.\nMacpherson\u2019s charisma pours through in both the band\u2019s\nflawless performance, and in the way\nhe engages and jokes with the crowd in\nbetween songs. The set list spanned the\nband\u2019s discography, from crowd-pleas-ing singles, to rarely played, mellow\nfan-favourite, \u2018Kyoto Garden\u2019, and the\nband were joined by the Magic Gang\nfrontman Jack Kaye, for \u2018Never Fade\nAway\u2019. The experience was surreal, and\nit was clear everybody there was excited to be seeing live music again after 6\nmonths, and knew the set inside out. It\nisatestamenttothebandthatthey were\nable to make a socially distanced gig\nfeel more intimate than most gigs were\npre-lockdown, and, with it being their\nlast show for a little while, I cannot wait\nto be back in the mosh pit for \u2018Chevy\nThunder\u2019 when they return.\nFRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\n25\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSpector\u2019s Socially Distaced Gig\nConcert Review\nWhite Cliffs\nReviewed by Rosie Millns Music Writer\nSingleby: The Wytches\nForfansof:Drenge,Yak\nRunTime:3 minutes 36 senconds\nSingle Review\nMACPHERSON\u2019S\nCHARISMA\nPOURS\nTHROUGH\nIN BOTH THE\nBANDS FLAWLESS\nPERFORMACE,\nAND IN THE WAY\nHE ENGAGES AND\nJOKES WITH THE\nCROWD\n\u201c\nThe Wytches have returned with\n\u2018White Cliffs\u2019, the 4th single from\ntheir upcoming 3rd album, Three Mile\nDitch. The four-piece band had disappeared since releasing their sophomore\nalbum Annabel Dream Reader in 2016,\nonly briefly reappearing to release Halloween singles \u2018Double World\u2019 and\n\u2018Double World \u2013 Sludge Version\u2019. The\nband pulled out of a much anticipated\nslot supporting Drenge on a UK tour,\nand finished the year with just a small\nhandful of intimate UK shows. However, The Wytches\u2019 long awaited return\nwas confirmed in June 2020, with the release of lead album single \u2018Cowboy\u2019, and\nconfirmation of their 3rd album in July.\nAfter a four-year hiatus, leaving\nHeavenly Records for their own label\nCable Code Records, and losing founding member of the band Gianni Honey,\nThe Wytches are back.\nWhite Cliffs\u2019 is slower than a typical song by The Wytches, however it\nstill contains the band\u2019s characteristic\nmoody vocals, dark and infectious riffs,\nand gritty, grungy sounds. Frontman\nKristian Bell said of the single,\u201cIt was a\ntrack I didn\u2019t really think would work as\na Wytches song. When trying out new\nideas, it\u2019s easy to tell when a song isn\u2019t\nworking even if it sounded like a typical\nWytches thing. This one really didn\u2019t resemble something we\u2019d do but we all really connected when playing it together.\u201d\nIt is to the band\u2019s great credit that they\nare able to maintain a unique and characteristic sound instantly identifiable\nas The Wytches, whilst still developing\nthemselves sonically.\nCatch The Wytches at their social-ly-distanced album release show at Komedia, Brighton on 30th October for\n\u00a315.\nThree Mile Ditch will be released on\nthe 30th October on Cable Code Records.\nReviewed by Rosie Millns Music Writer\n\n"

    "content": "Motivation is overrated.\nWe all have good inten-tions, intentions that don\u2019t manifest into results. We all may want\nto: build muscle, do more cardio,\nread more books, or even write\nregular blog posts. However,\nwhen trying to build a new\nhabit or develop a new skill,\none often falls into the trap\nof thinking big. Big goals,\nbig steps, big to do lists, big\npurchases to facilitate your\nbig new habit. James Clear\u2019s\nAtomic Habits,\u2019; however, attempts to steer people away\nfrom being helplessly \u2018consumed by the end goal,\u2019 voicing that \u2018one push-up is better than not exercising \u2026\nand it\u2019s better to do less than\nyou hoped than to do nothing at all.\u2019 And Clear raises\na good point: \u2018we rarely think\nabout change this way,\u2019 and it\u2019ll do\nus all some good if we practiced\nthis approach when developing\nhabits. So, let me indulge you in\nsome ideas I found noteworthy in\nClear\u2019s treasure trove of knowledge on building good habits, and\nbreaking the bad.\nThe crux of the book is this:\n\u2018Habits are the compound interest\nof personal development.\u2019 Achieving something remarkable or developing a good habit and quitting\na bad one requires incremental\nchange. This idea is persistent\nthroughout Clear\u2019s text. What was\nboth fascinating and worrying\nwas the fact that we know this. We\nknow that \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019, and anything worth doing\nrequires painful patience. Clear\u2019s\nwriting, however, makes one in-ternalise these cliches profoundly.\nClear explores in strenuous detail\nthe significance of \u2018Atomic Habits\u2019, using personal examples from\nhis own life and of\ncourse, an ample\namount of magnificent metaphors that further\nhelp one digest the importance of\nhabits.\nThree ideas I found unique\nand worthy of sharing were: the\n2-minute rule, identity-based\nhabits and the downside of habits\n\u2013 yes there are downsides!\nThe two-minute rule\nThe two-minute rule was a particular favourite of mine; mentioned also in David Allen\u2019s \u2018Getting things done,\u2019 Clear shares\nthat, in order to start and maintain\nany habit \u2013 start small. As small\nas possible. I\u2019ll use an example.\nSay, you\u2019d like to read more. Start\nby reading a page. Clear suggest\nspending just 2 minutes on that\ntask of reading a book. After those\n2 minutes however, you most\nprobably will just carry on read-ing, because you\u2019ve completed the\nhard part of the task. You actively picked up the book, sat down,\nand actually began to read. You\u2019ve\neliminated the daunting task of\nreading a whole book with many,\nmany words by candidly tricking\nyour brain into thinking \u2018just two\nminutes.\u2019 Clear\u2019s reasoning is that\nany new habit can be simplified,\nand any habit can be shortened to\njust 2-minutes: \u201cRead before bed\neach night\u201d becomes \u201cRead one\npage, \u201cDo thirty minutes of yoga\u201d\nbecomes \u201cTake out my yoga mat.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s one ground-breaking\nway of starting a new habit, but\nhow do you stick to that habit?\nClear casts a critical lens on\nbehaviour change and what possesses someone to excel at a hab-it. He argues that most habits are\n\u2018outcome-based habits.\u2019 Habits\nbased solely on results. Clear\ninterprets behaviour change using three layers: the outer layer\nbeing the change in outcome,\nfollowed by the change in process and then your identity\nwhich rests in the centre. Clear\ntackles behaviour change by dismantling the ubiquitous view\nthat you should solely have set\ngoals to work towards; instead\nsuggests that you work towards\nwho you wish to become. Habits\nare ultimately what distinguish\nyour views, beliefs and personality from a Bob, Karen or Margret.\nUnder the aegis of Clear, I put this\nto the test.\nRecently, I\u2019ve been particularly fond of the remarkable mental\nand physical condition of SBS op-erators. I found their level of fitness to be mesmerising; I wanted\nto be like them. I included more\nworkouts that mirror that of a soldier (push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups,\nrunning), I was consistent, and\nwith the wish to become anything\nas close to a Special Forces Operator, fitness soon became a a part\nof my identity. I focused on the\nprocess more than a desired phy-sique. My intensity in each session grew as I was more eager to\nmould myself into this new shiny\nidentity. I almost tricked my brain\ninto thinking I was an elite soldier\nBook review\nA must read for anyone wanting to start a new\nhabit!\nAtomic Habits\nReviewed by Hari Kumarakuruparan Books Editor\nBy James Clear\nCLEAR\u2019S REASONING\nIS THAT ANY NEW\nHABIT CAN BE\nSIMPLIFIED... \u201cREAD\nBEFORE BED EACH\nNIGHT\u201d BECOMES\n\u201cREAD ONE PAGE\u201d\n\u201c\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n28\n\u2013 pathetic I know. But this can be applied to any-thing, and often why people are inspired by celebrities and the successful. The message, however, is not\nto be yourself. The message is to make a habit apart\nof your identity by becoming a reader, a runner, a\nwriter, a boxer; instead of someone who wants to\nread, run and write. That slight adjustment in your\nmentality can make all the difference.\nThe downsides\nNow that you\u2019re charged with excitement and over\nthe moon with starting your new habit, allow me to\ndrag you, gently, back to reality. Let us now explore\nthe bitter, buzzkill actualities of developing a habit!\nWhy are good habits so hard to develop?\nAs humans, we \u2018place a high value on instant gratification.\u2019 Clear mentions \u2018the Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change: What is immediately rewarded is\nrepeated. What is immediately punished is avoided\u2019,\nwhich charmingly, explains why we procrastinate.\nOne might avoid a workout because of the \u2018delayed\nreturn\u2019 associated with a workout. Doing one hundred push-ups isn\u2019t going to result in an improved\nphysique immediately. Research has shown the\ninstant gratification associated with social media\n\n"

Our brain is susceptible to priori-tise these immediate gratifications; soon extending\nto a social media habit. In the book, Clear suggests\nmethods to exploit this characteristic of the brain to\nmake it easier to develop better habits, but also reveals the honest truth: \u2018At some point it comes down\nto who can handle the boredom of training everyday\u2026you have to fall in love with boredom.\u2019 Not\nthe most awe-inspiring quote in world \u2013 irrefutable,\nnonetheless.\nDownsides in the long run\nHabits come at a cost.

    "content": "Thought of as \u201cthe first\ntrue horror film\u201d by Roger Ebert, Caligari was a visual\nand thematic turn of pace\nfor cinema. On the surface\nit is the story of Holstenwall: a small town tormented\nby murder. After the death of his friend, Francis\n(played by Friedrich Feh\u00e9r) sets out to find the kill-er, and directs his focus towards a new double-act\nat the local circus: \u2018Dr Caligari\u2019 (Werner Krauss)\nand his haunting somnambulist Cesare (Conrad\nVeidt). However, if Robert Wiene\u2019s horror classic\nteaches us anything, it is that not everything is as\nit seems. Caligari\u2019s history, like the movie itself,\nis rife with deception, false-impressions, and imagined memories. Hans Janowitz and Carl Meyer,\nthe screenwriters, were influenced by a great many\nthings\u2014from torrid experiences in WW1 (such as\nMeyer faking madness to avoid military service) to\nold memories of Berlin circuses. The film is often\nseen as a critique of authority and blind conform-ity. However, when you watch the movie for the\nfirst time, the interpretation will almost certainly\ncome as an afterthought. You\u2019ll find yourself much\ntoo preoccupied with the delocalising set design,\nunable to fully distinguish hills from streets, or\nliving quarters from hospitals. The most engrossing element by far is Veidt\u2019s\nunearthly performance\u2014from\nthe way he slinks around the\nstreets at night, to his terror-ising gaze, teetering between\na look of piercing sentience, and\nthe torpid stare of a waking dream.\nFree Film of the Week: The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\nClassic of the Week: Dead Man\u2019s Letters\nEditor Recommends\nWe open in a land\nannihilated by\nnuclear war, a land where the\nstreets are strewn with charred\nbodies and muddy fallout, a\nland where shallow graves are\ndug in living rooms. Outside\nthe underground hovels that\nmany call home, there lives only rubble and radiation.\nCurfews are kept with brutal enforcement, such that\nonly the dead are allowed outside. All culture has been\nobliterated, and the libraries stand half-submerged\nin black morasses. Morale is low, values deteriorated,\nand death a mercy to many. \u201cDeath is not a frightening\nthing when everything has died\u201d. Professor Larsen\u2014a\nformer recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics\u2014begins\na letter to his lost son Eric: \u201cMy dear boy\u2026I am work-ing, can you imagine that?\u201d.\nThis is the bleak world of Dead Man\u2019s Letters. And\nyet, despite the desolation, the cruelty, and the de-cay, there is no other film I know of that has a more\nhumanitarian message. Made in 1986\u2014in the days\nof Chernobyl, Gorbachev, and Reagan\u2014where the\nthreat of nuclear disaster, by accident or premedita-tion, was still eerily present in the world, Dead Man\u2019s\nLetters stands out as a dissenting voice against rapacious governments thirsty for nuclear armaments. It\nappeals directly to the emotions to see the folly in war,\ncome \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018cold\u2019. One of the film\u2019s best features,\nthough unintentional, is its irony\u2014that its obscurity\nin Western cinema is likely a consequence of it having been absorbed into the propagandistic fog that\nit so vehemently warns about. While it did screen at\nCannes in 1987, its exposure in the West was slow\nand fleeting; its New York Times review, for example,\ncame out in 1989. This is of course no surprise\u2014olive\nbranches often\nfind themselves\ngetting conveniently snapped\nas they are\nextended.\nIn the world\nof cinema also,\n1986 was a\ndismal year: it\nsaw the release\nof Andrei\nTarkovsky\u2019s final\nmovie The Sacrifice in May, followed by his untimely\ndeath in December at the age of 54. Around this time,\nthe baton of Russian artistry seemed to have immediately fallen into the hands of Konstantin Lopushansky. Throughout Dead Man\u2019s Letters, Lopushansky\nunravels his message regarding the sanctity of life, and\nhis fear that modern culture has cheapened it, and\nmodern warfare disregarded it. Such appeals to the\nsoul, and to the goodness of people, naturally evoke\nstrong intimations of Tarkovsky. These similarities are\nno coincidence: Lopushansky was intimately involved\nin Tarkovsky\u2019s work, having helped him direct Stalker\nin 1979. Dead Man\u2019s Letters is a classic by the way its\ncentral dilemma is presented. It\u2019s firstly channelled\nthrough Larsen: he has \u201clogical theories\u201d that try to ascertain the chance of humanity\u2019s survival, all he needs\nis time. However, the people around him are packing\nup to make the perilous journey from the museum\nbasement where they\u2019ve been lodging, to the \u201ccentral\nbunker\u201d where they may be safe. Matters are made\nworse for him when he adopts some orphans who are\nsick and hungry, but alive. At this stage, the dilemma\nof saving humanity is channeled through the children:\nthey are the glimmers of hope in the wasteland.\nOf all the endings I\u2019ve ever seen, this is the closest\nto perfect. Larsen helps the orphans decorate a Christmas tree and then goes the way of his wife and young\nson Eric. The orphans gather round his deathbed to\nlook into the eyes of the Old World. \u201cRemember: the\nworld has not died\u201d he tells them, \u201cgo while you have\nthe strength, for while a man is on his way, there is still\nhope for him\u201d. And so, in coats they had no time to\ngrow into, in boots too big to cross the tundra and\nthe snow, the children wander hand-in-hand, as they\nhave seen the adults do, unaware that the world has\nabandoned them, but quite sure that they must not\nabandon each other.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nThe Cabinet of Dr Caligari\nFRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER 2020\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 27\nDirectedby: Konstantin\nLopushansky\nYearof Release: 1986\nDirectedby: Robert Wiene\nYearof Release: 1920\nStarring:Werner Krauss; Conrad\nVeidt; Friedrich Feh\u00e9r; Lil Dagover\nDead Man\u2019s Letters\nThe haunting stare of Conrad Veidt as the infamous\nsomnambulist Cesare\nScan to watch!\nOF ALL THE\nENDINGS I\u2019VE\nEVER SEEN, THIS\nIS THE CLOSEST\nTO PERFECT\n\u201c\nCredits: www.brevestoriadelcin-ema.org\nThe children go out into the wasteland, their fate uncertain\nCredits: marcinlachowicz.com\nCredits: Konstantin Lopushansky\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n38\nShould we really be picking\nwild mushrooms?\nIrecently had a boundary-breaking\nexperience during a moment of\ninter-species reconnection.\nRecently I visited my\nlocal woodland and had\nthe luck of coming across\nwild herbs, nuts and veg-etables. Overjoyed at the\ndiscovery, I foraged a stem\nof fennel, plus a couple\nof small courgettes and\ntheir bright yellow flowers making sure to leave plenty for\nothers to enjoy. Once back at home I\nnoticed I cooked the\nplants with more\ncare than usual, the\nflavours were so\nmuch more com-plex, stimulating\na new variation of\nstomach neurons\nand blessing the\ndiversity of my\ngut flora. But how\nsustainable is it for\npeople without a\nreal necessity to\nforage and hunt\nwild foods?\nEating wild\nfoods makes more\napparent our\nrelation to other\nspecies with whom\nwe share the earth, reminding us that\nwe too are wild nature. Having this\nconnection is vital, as scholar Gina\nRae La Cerva writes, \u2018to be alienated\nfrom wild nature is\nto be alienated from\nourselves\u2019. Foraging\nwild foods allows us\nto comprehend the\ncomplex connections of an ecosystem and millions\nof years of evolution that led to the\ngrowth of something we can eat.\nAs we are increasingly living in\nurban and suburban settings without\nany connection to wildness, most\nof us live in a state of disconnection\nfrom other species, and experiencing\nwildness has now become a luxury.\nYet this connection is\nso vital as studies on\nbiophilia have shown\nhow exposure to wildness reduces stress and\nanxiety and increases\nhappiness.\nMost of us do not\nrely on wild foods for\nsubsistence, so the wild food resurgence we see, especially in the Global\nNorth, is not out of need but appetite.\nAs we long for a sense\nof wildness no\nlonger present\nin our lives,\nwild foods have\nbecome fetish-ised and com-modified as a\ndelicacy.\nWild foods\nnow being a\nluxury item is\na product of\ndisaster capi-talism, which\nhas ended\nup ultimately destroying\nmost wild areas\nand created the\nmarketisation\nof all aspects of life. If this wasn\u2019t\nproblematic enough, niche markets\nof wild foods are actually destructive\nto ecosystems in the way they harvest\ncrops or animals, and the irregularity\nof nature is incompatible with industrial growth.\nThe trend of picking wild mushrooms has really grown over the past\ndecade with an increasing number\nof commercial collectors ransacking whole woodlands of their fungal\nspecies. Not only does this removal\ncause negative short-term effects on\nthe populations of fungi, but it also\ndamages the woodland long-term, as\nfungi have so many interconnected\nroles in maintaining the functioning\nof an ecosystem such as recycling nu-trients, being a host for invertebrates\nand providing food source to animals.\nEpping Forest in London is known\nfor having an abundance of mushrooms some years, but the Forestry\nServices of London highly advise\nagainst people foraging, 'We welcome\npeople visiting the forest\nand admiring the many\nfascinating shapes, forms\nand colours the fungi\nworld has to offer, but\nplease leave them there\nfor the next visitor and\nfuture generations to enjoy.\u2019\nIt is not viable for us all to depend\non wild foods; however, we can re-wild our agricultural systems through\nthe incorporation regenerative principles and increasing species diversity.\nAt the same time, we can improve\naccessibility to healthy foods to create\nabundance and mutual thriving for\nall. This action of transformation is\nnecessary for food and environmental\njustice, and it isn\u2019t a problem for the\nfuture, change is needed now.\nOur current global agricultural\nsystem does not serve to provide for\nall as it was designed for profit-mak-ing from the beginning of industrial-isation. Climate change is decreasing\nagricultural yields, so in some parts\nof the world, wild foods are essential\nfor food security. One million people\naround the globe depend on wild\nfoods for sub-sistence, which\nare mainly\nprocured by\nwomen bearing essential\necological knowledge, and a much\ndeeper understanding of the cycles of\nnetworks that feed and water us.\nSo, if we don\u2019t depend on wild\nfoods for subsistence, from time to\ntime it is ok to pick the occasional\nblackberry to eat yourself, but we\nshould not be supporting the marke-tisation of wild plants, animals and\nfungi as we have already taken too\nmany fish from the sea.\nThis article was inspired by the For\nthe Wild podcast hosted by Ayana\nYoung and the book \u2018Feasting Wild\u2019\nby Gina Rae La Cerva, a geographer\nand environmental anthropologist.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nThis Week\u2019s Sustainability Inspiration\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nOrganisation: Fibershed (www.fibershed.org)\nOn the theme of wildness, I would like to spotlight one organisation in particular that is inspiring the textile industry to strive for sustainability, and at its\ncore has re-wilding principles seen in practice as regenerative agriculture.\nThe project began in 2010 when Rebecca Burgess wanted to reduce the\nenvironmental impact of her wardrobe. And so began the challenge to source\ndyes, fibres and labour within 150 miles of the project's headquarters. After a\ncouple of months, the project became a movement and now Fibershed works\nin developing regional and regenerative fibre systems on behalf of independent\nproducers, implementing carbon farming, rebuilding regional manufacturing\nand connecting end-users with farms.\nThe ultimate aim is to create \u2018climate-beneficial\u2019 clothing, utilising the \u2018soil to\nsoil\u2019 principle, and to educate the public on the benefits of decentralising the\ntextile supply chain by creating a regenerative textile economy.\nEATING WILD\nFOOD MAKES\nMORE APPARENT\nOUR RELATION TO\nOTHER SPECIES\nWITH WHOM WE\nSHARE THE EARTH\nREMINDING US\nTHAT WE TOO ARE\nWILD NATURE.\n\u201c\n1 million\npeople depend on wild food\nfor subsistence\n\n"
