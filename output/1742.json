We\u2019ll be selecting which films we think will win, as\nwell as what we want to win; they\u2019re seldom the same\nFILMS\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\n\u201c\u2018Love the\nfilm, hate her\u2019The Academy\u2019s\nresponse to\nGreta\u2019s snub\u201d\nW\nho better\nto spout\nunsolicited\nopinions on\nthe 92ndAcademyAwards\nthan two people who\u2019ve\nindividually seen less than\n53% of the nominees?\nHowever, combining our\nwatched lists we can brag\na whopping total of 55%\n(statistics not verified).\nWielding our consumate\nknowledge of these films,\nand brandishing our blind\nignorance, we\u2019re going to\ngo through each category\nindividually and tell you\nwhat we want to win,\nwhat we think is the most\ndeserving, and what the\nactual verdict will be on\nthe night. So if you\u2019re\nplanning on grabbing\nsome popcorn and sitting\nwrapped in your duvet\nat 2am, spare a thought\nto what the Felix Film\nEditors have to say about\neach nomination, and\nwhy we\u2019ll be probably be\ndisappointed.\nAs this will no doubt\napply to many of our se-lections, we must mention\nthe fact that we believe\nthis list would look drastically different if we had\nhad the chance to watch\nParasite sooner than two\ndays before the ceremony.\nGoing off of unanimous\npraise, we think it\u2019s a film\nthat we will both enjoy\nimmensly.\nBest Picture\nWell this year the\nnominations in this\ncategory have just been\nplain strange. With Jojo\nRabbit (in the words of\nCharlotte, \u201cWhy?\u201d); Le\nMans \u201866 (who saw this\nfilm other than my dad?);\nJoker (a box office banger\nbut bored us on the big\nscreen), some of the\nnominations have been a\nbit of a disappointment.\nTaking spots where otherwise deserving films\ncould\u2019ve been given\ntheir recognition, a lot\nof cinema this year has\ngone underappreciated\nand underrepresented by\nThe Academy and awards\nshows this season. With\nthis in mind, here are our\npicks.\nFor what we would like\nto win, Dom has chosen\nMarriage Story. \u201cOne of\nthe most honest portrayals of the hardships in\ndivorce, it deftly avoided\nall the shortcomings that\ncould be found in the\nsombre legal precedings.\nHeart-warming and\nheart-breaking, it was the\nstand out film for me this\nyear.\u201d\nFor Charlotte, she\u2019s torn\nbetween The Irishman\nand Marriage Story. This\nconflict was brought\ninto fruition because,\nwith the memory of an\noverworked physicist,\ndetails of Marriage Story\nare foggy (\u201cI know that I\nloved Marriage Story at\nthe time, but four months\ndown the line I\u2019m struggling to justify why\u201d).\nHowever, with the images\nstill vivid in her mind,\nCharlotte has dubbed The\nIrishman as her Oscar\nwinner, \u201cwith the veteran\nensemble of actors and\nlegend Martin Scorsese\nat the helm, this 3.5 hour\nepic is more than deserving of its nomination.\u201d\nDespite our heartfelt\nopinions, we\u2019re (rather be-grudgingly) expecting to\nsee 1917 take home Best\nPicture this year. This isn\u2019t\nto say that it\u2019s not a great\nfilm with many excellent\naspects in its own right, it\njust isn\u2019t really something\nwe haven\u2019t seen before\n(war films, single takes?\nBeen there, done that).\nIt\u2019s almost like a facto-ry-made film, tailored for\nThe Academy; we\u2019d like\nto have some more variety\nrather than the same\n\u2018grand-old-war-pic\u2019, but\nwith foreshadowing from\nthe Golden Globes and the\nBAFTAs, it\u2019s not looking\nlikely.\nBest Director\n\u2018And The Academy\naward for Best Director\ngoes to...Greta Gerwig\u2019\nOh wait.\nUpon hearing the\nabsense of a nomination\nfor Greta Gerwig (Little\nWomen) in the Best\nDirector category despite\nthe Best Picture and\nAdapted Screenplay nom-inations, we got in contact\nwith The Academy for\ntheir explaination, the\nemail we received simply\nsaid: \u201cLove the film, hate\nher\u201d.\nThis year, with the exception of Bong Joon-ho,\nthe nominations in this\ncategory just aren\u2019t all that\nexciting. Veterans Tarantino and Scorsese stumble\non into the last legs of\ntheir careers, while Todd\nPhillips breaks ground\nwith his first nomination.\nIt would nice to see Bong\nwin, but having not seen\nit, Sam Mendes would\nbe Dom\u2019s pick for most\ndeserving director.\n\u201cThe film was massively enjoyable, and despite\nlacklustre character\ndevelopment and story,\nthe direction in 1917 was\nphenomenal.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Charlotte goes with Martin\nScorsese, but wants it\nknown that she holds no\nstrong opinions on this\ncategory and would be\nequally enthused if none\nof them won (Bong,\nsweetie, I\u2019m so sorry, but\nI haven\u2019t seen Parasite\nyet).\nAgain, looking at this\nthrough the eyes of The\nAcademy, we think that\nSam Mendes is most\nlikely to take home a win\nthis year.\nBest Actor\nContrary to the\nprevious categories, we\nare in agreement that we\u2019d\nboth love to see Adam\nDriver on the podium\nthis Sunday. His colossal\nperformance in Marriage\nStory allowed the other\nexcellent displays from\nScarlett Johansson and\nLaura Dern to orbit\naround him, grounding\nitself as both real and\nmoving. We\u2019d really love\nto see him win.\nPutting this aside,\nit goes without saying\nthat Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s\nperformance in Joker was\nnothing short of astound-ing, simply disappearing\ninto the role, and we\u2019re\nplacing our bets on him\nto win. However, it\u2019s\nalso worth noting that we\ndon\u2019t think that this is his\nbest ever perfomance; The\nMaster and Her are two\nexamples of outstanding\ndisplays of talent which\nwe believe to have been\nmore worthy. It will be\nnice to see him finally get\nan Oscar he deserves.\nBest Actress\nAs self-confessed\nlovers of Saoirse Ronan,\ngod, we\u2019d really like to see\nher win this for her role\nin Little Women. As one\nof the best, young talents\nin film today, she simply\nmelts into every role. For\neach film, it almost feels\nas though she really has\nbecome character, no\nlonger in the domain of\nacting; she is Jo March,\nshe is Lady Bird. She\nremains so in-touch with\nthe character, it\u2019s easy to\nforget she\u2019s acting, and\nso her perfomance can be\neasily dismissed as un-derstated, with no distinct\nstandout moments.\nIn contrast with this,\nwe have Scarlett Johansson, who in this instance,\nshowcased a somewhat\nmore performative role.\nIt did not have the same\neffect as Ronan playing Jo\nMarch, where the actress\nbecomes the character,\nbut objectively this was\na more clear display\nof talent than Ronan\u2019s\nnuanced style. Johansson\nreally wore heart on her\nsleeve for this, allowing a\nBrad Pitt as Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood // Sony Pictures\n\n"

The\npositions include senior\nUnion roles such as\nthe sabbatical officers\n(Union President, Deputy\nPresident, and ICSMSU\nPresident), Constituent\nUnion Presidents,\nthe Liberation and\nCommunity Officers, and\nacademic and wellbeing\nstudent representatives.\nAny student may stand\nfor election, though final\nyear students can only\nstand for full-time sabbatical roles.\nThe nominations\nopened on Monday 3rd\nFebruary and will run until\nFriday 28th, followed by\ncampaigning from the\n4th of March and voting\nbetween 9th and 12th\nMarch. The results are\nexpected to be announced\nin Metric on the 13th, at\nthe Results Party.\nImperial has consistently had some of the\nhighest election turnouts\nin the country, hitting\n41% last year. It has also\nhad particularly fierce\ncompetition for certain\nroles in recent years, with\nmore students standing\nand competing for roles.\nThe week prior to the\nvotes opening, the \u2018Meet\nthe Candidates\u2019 debate\nwill take place, where\nnominees for the most\nsenior positions will\ndebate questions posed\nby Felix Deputy Editor\nCharlie Titmuss. The\nshow will be streamed\nlive on the ICU Facebook\npage and will be produced\nby ICTV and IC Radio.\nThe Head of Student\nVoice, Keriann Lee, said:\n\u201cLE20 is the biggest\ndemocratic exercise at\nImperial in which all\nstudents choose full time\nsabbatical officers and\nsenior volunteers for\nacademic year 2020-21.\n\u201cThe elections have\nimproved dramatically in\nthe past two years through\na systematic management\nprocess and this has\nresulted in a smoother\nexperience for students\nwith increasingly higher\nnominations and voter\nparticipation. This year's\nnomination period will\ninclude talks about the\nmajor positions so that\nstudents have even more\ninformation about the\nresponsibilities and commitment involved before\nstanding. It's felt that the\ntalks, held every Wednesday during February at\nthe Union, should allow\nfor even more realistic\nmanifestos and informed\ncampaigning.\n\u201cOver the past four\ncycles, more time has\nbeen spent during the\nnominations process\nensuring that students\nunderstand the roles, why\nthey are important, and\nwhat the commitment is.\nThis, coupled with greater\nmulti-campus promotions\nand better segmented\ncommunications, has led\nto a stronger field of can-didates, better campaigns,\nand ultimately higher\nturnout.\n\u201cAn additional step\nhas been inserted into\nthe elections timetable\nto make the complaints\nprocess even smoother. In\naddition to the complaints\ndeadline, students will\nnow have the chance to\nindicate their intention to\nsubmit a complaint right\nafter polls close so that\nthere are fewer surprises\non results day and the\nteam can administer the\nprocess more efficiently.\u201d\n\u201cImperial has\nconsitently\nhad some of\nthe highest\nelection\nturnouts in\nthe country,\nhitting 41%\nlast year\u201d\nTHE Names Imperial Sixth Most International Uni\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nimes Higher\nEducation has\nranked Imperial\nCollege London\nas the 6th most international university in the\nworld, and 1st most international in the UK.\nThe top two spots in\nthe global ranking are\ntaken by two universities\nin Hong Kong, the City\nUniversity of Hong Kong\nand University of Hong\nKong respectively.\nUniversity of Oxford\ntakes joint 7th in the\nglobal ranking, along with\nthe National University of\nSingapore; whereas University of Cambridge is\nnext at 9th. Other top UK\nuniversities are ranked as\nfollows: King\u2019s College\nLondon at 11th, University College London at\n12th, and London School\nof Economics and Political Science at 15th.\nThe ranking is calculated by weighting several\nfactors: the proportion\nof international students,\nthe proportion of international staff, the number\nof journal publications\nwith one or more international co-author, and the\ninternational reputation\nof the university. These\nfour factors are weighted\nequally. International\nreputation is measured by\nTimes Higher Education\nby inviting scholars to\nrank the world\u2019s best\nuniversities for their field,\nand looking at the proportion of overseas votes\nreceived for a university.\nIn 2017-18, 64% of\nnewly admitted students\n(both undergraduate and\npostgraduate) were from\noutside the UK.

On the surface it\nis just a turn-based tactics\ngame with a cute art style,\nbut as you dive deep into\nthe lore, gameplay and\ncompetitive multiplayer,\nyou soon realise that this\nis a title more than fitting\nas the spiritual successor\nto Advance Wars.\nWargrooveisdeveloped\nand published by Chucklefish \u2013 a British video\ngame developer based in\nLondon! They are known\nfor some amazing Indie\nGames, such as Starbound\nand Stardew Valley, the\nlatter being a masterpiece\nin itself.\nWith a team of only 13\npermanent staff, it\u2019s truly\namazing what they can\naccomplish.\nAs someone who is\ntypically not a fan of turn-based tactics games, I was\ninitially sceptical. I heard\ngreat things and decided\nto buy the physical copy\non Nintendo Switch; it\nhad a map and a strategy\nguide, so I guess I had\nto, I am a huge collector\nafter all. I booted it up and\nwas immediately greeted\nby a dramatic opening\ncutscene, hand-drawn yet\nnot lacking beautifully\nanimated movement.\nFrom the moment I saw\nthis, I knew the game\nhad charm. There are\nthree modes that you can\nplay. The story mode is\nsingle player only and\ntakes you on a journey\nthrough the continent of\nAurania to defeat the evil\nforces of Felheim after\nSigrid \u2013 a 900-year-old\nvampire \u2013 murders the\nmain character\u2019s father\nin cold blood. I say the\nmain character rather than\njust \u2018you\u2019 as you play as\nmuch more than just the\nprincess Mercia. As you\nprogress through the story\nyou learn about 4 main\nwarring factions throughout Aurania and have\naccess to play as many\nof the leaders of these\nfactions. The brilliant\nthing about Wargroove is\n\u201cWhat makes\nWargroove\nreally stand\nout is its\nartistic value\u201d\n\u201cMultiplayer\nis always fun.\nYou never feel\nas though you\nhave been\ncheesed from a\nsure victory\u201d\nthat each faction leader\nhas their own special\nability or \u2018Groove\u2019 which\ndictates the play style of\nwhomever you are given\nat the start of the battle.\nThis groove can range\nfrom healing people in\nan area to summoning an\nundead skeleton to aid\nyou in battle.\nThe gameplay is very\naddictive. Summoning\nunits and capturing\nvillages with said units in\norder to gain income is the\nmain focus of each battle\n\u2013 as well as either destroying the enemy stronghold\nor leader to eventually\nwin. This seems simple\nenough, but with each unit\nhaving their own strengths\nand weaknesses (rock-pa-per-scissors style) and\ntheir own unique requirements to achieve a critical\nhit, there was a high level\nof complexity that I found\ndeeply rewarding.\nAs well as the 50+\nhours of main story, one\ncan choose to play through\nthe arcade mode, a series\nof smaller missions which\nupon completion you\nreceive various rewards.\nCharacters, as well as\na multitude of pages of\nlore, can be unlocked\nby playing the main\ncampaign. One could\nalso choose to play the\npuzzle mode, a devilish\nbrain-teaser of an option\nwhich poses puzzles\nwhich you have to solve\ngiven your knowledge\nof the mechanics of the\ngame. These start off relatively simple but quickly\ngrow to be insanely frustrating (in a good way).\nMy main complaint\nabout the gameplay would\nhave to be the artificial\ndifficulty settings. Rather\nthan being able to choose a\nvariety of difficulties that\nreflect the intelligence of\nthe AI, you instead choose\ndifficulties which alter\nthe amount of damage\nyou receive/do. This is\nunderstandable given the\nsmall team that worked on\nWargroove, but a better\ndifficulty system would\nhave been great to see,\nespecially when I wanted\nto up the difficulty on\ncompletion of the game\nbut decided not to because\nit just felt pointless.\nWhat makes Wargroove really stand out\nis its artistic value. By\nthis I mean the beautiful\nsprite art, which in motion\nfeels much more realistic\nthan you would expect.\nWeather changes cause\nobjects to move in the\nwind, and the spray of\nwater as sea-based units\nmove is far too satisfying\nto ignore. Being named\nWargroove, you would\nexpect to hear some\nbanging tunes. Well,\nluckily, Chucklefish does\nnot disappoint. The songs\nreally set the mood of\nbattle incredibly well,\nwith a playfulness to them\nthat reminds you that it is\njust a game, a playful one\nat that. The light-hearted\nnature of this game is reflected in its music and art\nstyle and allows it to have\nan almost Nintendo-like\ncharm. I compare Wargroove to Nintendo games\n(as a massive fanboy\nof Nintendo) because it\nis just so chock-full of\nthings to do. When you\naren\u2019t playing you can\nread through all of the\nlore or listen to the music\nwithin the music player\nmenu. Alternatively, you\ncan marvel at the artwork,\nincluding concept art for\nall the characters.\nAfter all of this though,\nthere is also a rich multiplayer mode. You can\ndesign your own maps\nin a level editor, which\nI must say is top notch,\nor play ready-made\nmaps against friends (or\nstrangers) online. The\ntechnical level of players\nis variable (you will get\nyour arse whooped) but\nit is always fun, and you\nnever really feel like you\nhave been cheesed from a\nvictory. The multiplayer\nis still thriving today and\nhopefully with the free\nDLC update (Feb 6th)\nthat introduces a whole\nnew faction and 2 new\nunits, there will be even\nmore returning players to\nface.\nAfter playing this\ngame to death and still not\ngetting bored, other than\nthe occasional insane difficulty spike and annoying\ndifficulty settings, I would\nsay that Wargroove is\nexcellent value for money.\nIt is available on PC, PS4,\nSwitch and Xbox One for\naround $20. If you are a\nfan of tactics games, or\njust love a game with a\nlot of charm (and dogs,\nomg I forgot to mention\nall the dogs), then I could\nnot recommend this any\nmore! 4/5 stars.\nThe characters in this game have so much...character! // Wargroove.com\nGAMES\nFELIX ISSUE 1742\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nDeveloper: Chucklefish\nGenre: Turn-based Tactics\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, XBO,\nSwitch\nWargroove\n\n"

Specifically,\nthe issue is that decisions\nare made in very limited\n\u2018silos\u2019. Different areas of\nthe College\u2019s operation\nare divvied up and the\nresponsibility for them\nis given to particular\nareas or divisions. So, for\nexample, the halls rent\nrenegotiations are led by\nCampus Services with\nthe oversight of senior\nmembers of the College\nsuch as the CFO or the\nProvost.\nThis is fine. This is\nefficiency. We had a\ndiscussion in the Felix\noffice this week about\n\u2018min-maxing\u2019, or running\nto optimal efficiency in\neverything you do. It\u2019s not\nalways positive, but in the\ncase of business, there\u2019s\na lot to be said for that\napproach. This is efficient\nand expedient for quick\ndecision-making.\nThe problems come\nwhen the silos don\u2019t\ntalk to eachother and\nmake their decisions in a\ncomplete vacuum. That\u2019s\nwhen quick decisions are\nmade, but not good ones\n\u2013 because every decision\nhas ramifications beyond\njust the limited remit\nin which they are being\nmade.\nI\u2019m going to take the\nhalls rent example again.\nThe rent prices are being\nincreased significantly.\nThis is according to what\nthe College has described\nas a \u201cbreak-even\u201d model,\nin which revenue is\nmatched to cost, and what\nthe Union has described\nas not actually being\nbreak-even. Wherever\nyou fall in that debate, the\nend result is rents hitting\naround \u00a3300 per week in\nSouth Kensington within\nthe next five or so years.\nIt\u2019s hitting market rate, if\nnot possibly over.\nThis is very high.\nSignificantly above what\nmost students can afford\nwith just their maintenance loan. Significantly\nabove even what many\ninternational students\ncould afford. I don\u2019t think\nit is controversial to say\nthat this will price many\npoor prospective students\nout of halls.\nLet\u2019s put it this way,\nanecdotally: I, who joined\nin 2014, would almost\ncertainly reject my Imperial offer if I were applying now, purely on the\nfinancial level. I worked\nbetween 20 and 45 hours\na week every week at the\nbars while being a hall\nsenior during part of my\ndegree, just to get through.\nAdding another 5 or 10\nhours per week atop that,\nas I\u2019d have to do now, just\nwouldn\u2019t be feasible.\nThis decision was made\nby the financial side of the\nCollege just a couple of\nmonths after the Office for\nStudents, the regulator for\nEnglish universities, had\nessentially mandated them\nto increase the number\nof students from disadvantaged backgrounds\nbecause those numbers\nwere so low.\nTo quote from the\nDPW\u2019s blog, \u201caccording\nto the plan, considering\nUndergraduate home\nstudent admissions, there\nis a gap between IMD Q1\nand Q5 of 24.8% and\nPOLAR4 Q1 and Q5\nby 54.2%.\u201d For reference,\nIMD and POLAR4 are\nessentially indices of\ndeprivation and higher\neducation participation\nrespectively, with Q1 and\nQ5 being the lowest and\nhighest quintiles.\nFrom the College\u2019s\nAccess to Participation\nPlan, a five-year plan for\nremedying this problem,\n55% of students here are\nfrom the top quintile of\nPOLAR4.\nAs a personal opinion:\nthose numbers are pretty\nshocking.\nAnd this is just weeks\nafter the Union has\nestablished a Working\nClass officer for the same\nreason \u2013 hence the DPW\u2019s\nblog quote above.\nNow think: can you\neven imagine what the\npeople responsible for\nfixing that are feeling\nin the light of these rent\ndebates and decisions?\nWould that not just be the\nmost frustrating thing in\nthe world? I can\u2019t speak\nfor them \u2013 and if you are\na member of staff working\non this, please do contact\nme with your thoughts off-the-record \u2013 but it\u2019s just so\nobviously the College as\nan institution chasing two\ntotally misaligned goals.\nI don\u2019t feel like these\ntwo groups of people are\ntalking. I don\u2019t see how\nthey can be. The fact that\na decision got a bigger\nExcel spreadsheet number\nis great for finance, but\nthat it utterly screwed over\nanother major goal of the\nCollege doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe a factor in determining\nwhether that was a good\ncall.\nIt\u2019s not the only case of\nin-silo decision making.\nIt\u2019s something that\u2019s\npopped up in quite a few\nNews articles and investigations this year. And\nit\u2019s making things very\ndifficult for many people,\nas different areas of the\nCollege push-and-pull on\nthe same issue, trying to\ninfluence it in different\ndirections for their own\ngoals and purposes. That,\nthen, destroys efficiency.\nI would argue that this\nis partly the role of the\nStrategies \u2013 to provide a\nunified goal for different\ndivisions of the College to\nbase their decision-mak-ing on. That\u2019s great. But\nwhat\u2019s better is having a\ndecision-making structure\nthat involves people\nfrom multiple areas, with\nmultiple goals, having an\ninput at an early stage.\nDecisions should not be\nmade so unilaterally in an\norganisation with such a\ndiverse range of pressures\nand requirements.\nThat\u2019s important to\nnote. None of this is easy.\nA university has a very\ndifficult job of keeping\nitself solvent, managing\nrelationships with various\nstakeholders internal and\nexternal, and looking after\nits students. A corporation\ndoesn\u2019t have that problem,\nand neither does a school.\nIt\u2019s a unique position to\nbe in, especially when\nconfronted with colossal threats like Brexit.\nThere\u2019s no \u201chandbook\u201d\nfor that, no pocket guide,\nand fundamentally people\nare often doing the best\nthey can.\nSo don\u2019t get me wrong\n\u2013 I think this can read as\ncritical. In a way, it is \u2013 I\nam saying that the decisions being made are bad,\nI suppose. Or certainly\nhave been made with a\nlimited scope in mind.\nBut the issue doesn\u2019t\nreally lie on individuals,\nit lies in decision-making\nstructures that have risen\norganically and before\nmost of the senior people\nin the College were even\nin their roles. It\u2019s not a\nmalicious thing, or even a\nquestion of incompetence.\nIf anything, it\u2019s a\nculture change that needs\nto happen. But rolling\nthat out is an enormous\nchallenge.\nWe can see approaches\nto this being developed\non the departmental\nlevel \u2013 explorations of\nsharing space between\ndepartments, led by Chris\nBanks, for example. There\nis work on this. But it\nneeds to be recognised\nas a serious problem and\nserious work needs to be\ndone to roll it out across\nevery level of College.\n2\n\n"

These\nhave come to an end, and\nthe headline result is that\nwe could not come to an\nagreement. However, by\ncontinually engaging in\nthenegotiationsandtaking\na firm view that we should\nnot endorse unaffordable\nprices for students, we\nhave been able to secure\na \u00a33 million reduction\non the rent prices over a\n5-year period. Here\u2019s how\nwe\u2019ve got to where we are\nnow.\nBackground\nNegotiations began late\nlast year when the College\nprovided us with an\nupdated financial model\nfor hall rents, to coincide\nwith the opening of a new\nhall (Kemp Porter) in the\ncoming academic year\nwhich will roughly double\nthe number of available\nbed spaces in Acton.\nThe model included\nsome costs our rents\nalready cover, such as\nday-to-day and long-term\nmaintenance, security\nand other staff costs, and\ncapital costs: the costs\nassociated with paying\ndown the debt the College\nincursinbuildingthehalls.\nIt also included additional\ncosts: certain staff whose\nsalaries were not previously covered by student\nrents were added, raising\nthe total figure. This led to\nquestions, as did the logic\nbehind the steep (80%)\nincrease in long-term\nmaintenance costs, the\nimplicit assertion that the\nhalls would totally lose\ntheir value after a 50-year\ndesign life (with students\npicking up the tab for this\ndepreciation) despite this\nmaintenance, and the way\ncosts were being inflated.\nMore fundamentally, the\nlogic behind a \u201cbreakeven\u201d model, where\nstudent rents were made\nto cover any and all costs\nthe College associate with\nthese halls, was question-able. None of the revenue\nfrom the planned lease of\nPembridge Hall would be\nfactored into supporting\nthese rents, for example.\nThe Negotiations\nThe ensuing back and\nforth led to some minor\nconcessions. Proposals\nwe were offered were\nrejected in deliberation\nwith elected student reps\nat Union Council, on the\ngrounds that they still\npresented steep increases\nwithout a satisfactory\nexplanation.\nMost recently, earlier\nthis week, we had some\npromising conversations\ntowards a workable com-promise. Unfortunately,\nthe College\u2019s resultant\n\u201cfinal offer\u201d (\u00a33m out of a\ntotal ~\u00a3110m over 5 years)\nwasn\u2019t enough for us to\nbe willing to endorse it.\nThough it makes a small\ndifference, this offer will\nstill lead to steep increases\nin rent, beyond the realms\nof what\u2019s reasonable (in\nthe short term), and we\ndon\u2019t feel the College has\ntruly engaged with us on\nthe fundamental premises\nthat led to these costs. We\nare now exploring other\noptions to effect change\non this matter.\nFrom our experience,\nwe wanted to share our\nkey takeaways:\n1) Saying \u201cno\u201d\nworks\nThough the place we\u2019ve\nended up is far from ideal,\nit does represent a concession on the part of the\nCollege that didn\u2019t come\nby default. The College\nwere expecting us to focus\non how to spread the rent\nincreases across different\nhalls, as our predecessors\ndid, rather than on the\nincreases themselves. By\nsaying \u201cno\u201d, and having\na more holistic conversa-tion, we were able to shine\na spotlight on this issue\nand shift the College\u2019s\nposition.\n2) Access to information matters\nWhile some of the\ninformation we asked for\nwas shared with us, lots\nof what we were given\nfell short of the detail\nwe would have expected\neither because the College\nwas unwilling to provide\nthe information, or the\ninformation didn\u2019t exist.\nWe can\u2019t be expected to\nmake informed decisions\nwith such asymmetry.\n3) The College\u2019s\nfinances are prioritised\nover students\u2019 finances\nWhile the College says\nwhat is being offered is\naffordable compared to\nother London university\nhalls, there are some\nissues with this: 1) it\u2019s not\nnecessarily clear if that\nwill still be the case in 5\nyears\u2019 time, 2) many of\nthese universities rely on\nprivate accommodation,\nwhereas we are negotiating over an in-house\nprovision, 3) rent in our\nhalls would be increasing\nfar in excess of rents in\nprivate accommodation,\n4) by the College\u2019s own\ncalculations, after any\nkind of increase on this\nyear\u2019s rents, it would be\ncheaper for the average\nfunding should go into\nsupporting them should\nnot be taken for granted,\nyet staff members on key\nCollege committees were\n(to our knowledge) never\npresented with a proposal\nfor such a subsidy.\n4) The university is\nworking against itself\nSimply put, too many\ndecisions at Imperial are\ntaken in exclusion of each\nother. While the Provost\u2019s\nnew academic strategy\nspeaks about considering\nthe experience of students\nholistically (i.e. acknowledging the blurred lines\nbetween our academic and\nnon-academic experience\nof Imperial), the College\u2019s\nproposals on rent remain\nantithetical to any work\nstaff and students do\nto improve our student\nsatisfaction, or supporting\nunderrepresented students\nin line with regulatory re-quirements. We shouldn\u2019t\nbe in a situation where the\nefforts and spending of\none team in the College\ndirectly counteract that of\nanother.\n5) Working together\nmatters\nWe ran for these roles\non a simple principle:\nthat those affected by\ndecisions Imperial makes\n(students and staff)\nshould be involved in the\ndecision-making process.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean being\nconsulted only to be put\nto one side: we need to\nwork in partnership from\nthe beginning on major\nissues like this. Were there\nfaith that all parties want\nwhat\u2019s best for Imperial\nas a whole, there would\nbe higher levels of trust\nacross our campuses,\nand less ill-feeling when\ndifficult decisions have to\nbe made.\nA house divided against itself cannot stand // Imperial Asset Library\nstudent to live outside\nhalls than in them. This\nis difficult to understand:\nlandlords make a profit,\nwhile the College ought to\nbe \u201cbreaking even\u201d.\nFirst year halls of residence are very important\nto the undergraduate expe-rience; to (in the College\u2019s\nwords) \u201cdevelop a sense\nof home and community.\u201d\nThe idea that no central\n\u201cLandlords\nmake a profit\nwhile the\ncollege ought\nto be breaking\neven\u201d\n\n"

Under an interrogation scenario, you\nwould probably guess that\nit\u2019s an \u201cextended poetic\nexploration\u201d written by\na Dutch collective called\nsomething like Metahaven, and that you could\nnever reasonably use\nthe phrase in a sentence\nwithout spending a further\n\ufb01ve minutes trying to\nexplain a term you\u2019re not\neven sure if you really un-derstand. And you would\nbe correct. But unlike\nmost extended poetic ex-plorations, I think that this\none has a more prescient\nmessage hidden amongst\nthe techno-political pro-tologisms and Flaubert\nquotations.\nThe premise of the\nbook is to question how\nwe live and interact\nwith digital technology\nthrough the lens of\ncinema. Speci\ufb01cally, the\nlens of Andrei Tarkovsky.\nThe book recognises\nthe contrast of trying to\ncompare our \ufb01ber optic,\nattention redundant lives\nto a Russian \ufb01lm director\nfamed for slow shots of\nalmost still images and\nwho \u201cdetested computers\nbefore they were omnipresent,\u201d but stick with\nit. The connection lies\nin the smartphone, the\n\u201cyet-undeclared cinema\nof the interface,\u201d the\ntechnology that allows\nanybody to produce,\nshare and view \ufb01lms on\ndemand. We are increasingly being immersed in\nthis cinema, the average\nUS adult spends two\nhours and 51 minutes on\ntheir smartphone every\nday, eight minutes longer\nthan Tarkovsky\u2019s \ufb01lm\nStalker. The book tries to\nde\ufb01ne a new phenomenon\nof Digital Tarkovsky: \u201ca\ncinematic discrepancy\nbetween speed of platform\nand lived experience\nunder all-encompassing\ncomputational force,\u201d or\nhow digital services like\nInstagram aim to make\nlife seem to move faster\nusing techniques similar\nto Tarkovsky, controlling\nthe pace and pressure of\ntime to create immersive\ncinema.\nThe effects of this\nphenomenon range from\nmobile phone journalism\nto machine vision and\ndash cam crash montages.\nThe book explores these\ntangents alongside plots\nfrom Tarkovsky\u2019s \ufb01lms\nand, to meet the brief of a\npoetic exploration, intersperses \u201ccut to\u201d sections\nvarying from short scenes\nof everyday life to tales\nof St Francis of Assisi.\nSpeci\ufb01c focus is paid to\nhow, like in Tarkovsky\u2019s\n\ufb01lms, the technique of\npacing is used to create a\nsuspension of disbelief.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see this\nwillful belief in \ufb01ction\neverywhere online from\nsocial media in\ufb02uencers\nto twitter bots spreading\nfake news. This is presented as a byproduct of\ntechnology overcoming\nthe uncanny valley as\nwell as almost universal access to cameras\nmaking everyday scenes\nmore cinematic whilst\ndestroying faith in images\nbeing truthful. In the age\nof Digital Tarkovsky\nwe take the \u201cspectre of\ntechno-political force\u201d as\nsomething inescapable\nand ambient. Importantly,\nthe book touches on the\npsychological effects on\nthe viewer like FOMO\nand a feeling of isolation\nwhen using services like\nInstagram where stories\nand are stitched together\nwith the \u201cpost-continuity\u201d\nof a Michael Bay movie.\nMetahaven ultimately\nask us to question who\nHow can we view the tiny screens on our smartphones through Tarkovsky\u2019s cinematic lens?

    "content": "CONSTITUENT UNION\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n34\nRSMU & CGCU\nChris Carter\nRSMU President\nFatima Khan\nCGCU President\nthese rapidly increasing\nprices would cause to the\nstudent experience. But\nthat isn\u2019t really in conten-tion.\nOn Tuesday, Union\nCouncil met to continue\nthis ongoing discussion,\nafter a majority of\nCouncil members noted\ntheir discomfort at the\nCouncil Meeting on 21st\nJanuary. At the behest\nof Council, an \u2018Extraordinary Meeting\u2019 was\narranged for two weeks\nlater, to discuss our next\nsteps. This \u2018Extraordinary\nMeeting\u2019 featured the\nthird and (allegedly) \ufb01nal\noffer from College, which\nCouncil voted to reject\nas well. This third model\nfeatured a \u00a33m subsidy\nthat could be distributed\nhow the Union desired,\nshould we have voted to\naccept the deal. It was presented to Council for the\n\ufb01rst time at the meeting,\nwith minimal detail into\nhow the subsidy would\nbe distributed across the\nvarious halls of residenc-es. However, this lack\nof detail or clarity made\nus feel that we could not\nvote either way on this\nproposal, regardless of\nour personal opinions on\nthe subject.\nAs voting members\nof Council, we chose to\nabstain from this vote due\nto a lack of clarity around\nthe third proposed model,\nlack of time to deliberate\non the issue, and a general\ndiscomfort with the\nproceedings. We\u2019re very\naware that the \ufb01gures\nwere given to the Union\nPresident about four\nhours before the meeting\nand there is slight time\npressure since College\nneed to start advertising\nthe price of halls soon.\nHowever, we should not\nhave been expected to\nvote on an issue that we\ndid not have enough time\nto process individually or\nconsult our committees\nand members about.\nAbsent Council members\nwere also deprived of the\nopportunity to speak up\nabout the new proposal,\nor to even see it, before it\nwas rejected. The blame\nfor this lack of clarity lies\nsquarely with College \u2013\nproviding a \u201cnew\u201d model\nmere hours before student\nrepresentatives are asked\nto vote on it is shameful\nand blatantly disrespect-ful.\nAfter that third rejec-tion, the vote turned to a\nmuch more contentious\ntopic \u2013 what to do next.\nCouncil had rejected the\nCollege\u2019s \ufb01nancial model\nthree times, and a plan of\nwhat to do next was deliberated at this Extraordinary Meeting. Of course,\nthe Union President and\nthe Deputy President\n(Welfare) will go back to\nCollege and re-negotiate.\nWe believe that College\nhave so far been somewhat\nwilling to negotiate, albeit\nwith a frustrating lack of\ntransparency, and still\nhave some leeway, but\nbeyond that no concrete\nplan had been mentioned.\nAnd this is where things\ngot strange.\nOn Wednesday 29th\nJanuary, the Union held\na preliminary, two-hour-long meeting where any\ninterested members of\nCouncil could come along\nand have their say on\npossible options. We were\nnot able to attend this\nmeeting due to prior com-mitments, but a document\nwas written following this\nmeeting.\nThis document comprises two main sections:\n\ufb01rst, a recommendation\nfrom Council that a\nUnion campaign called\n\u201cImperial, Cut the Rent\u201d\nbe started, which \u201cany\nstudent would be able to\njoin\u201d and would \u201cbe run by\na committee elected from\nits members\u201d. The second\npart of the document was\na list of possible options\nof campaign strategies,\nwhich we as a Council\ndebated individually\nas discrete strategies\nto endorse. There are\nnumerous things that we\nthought were weird about\nthis.\nFirst of all, this\ndocument was presented\nto members of Council\nbefore we had voted to\nreject the third model.\nWe appreciate that the\ndocument had been\nwrittenbeforethemeeting,\nbut isn\u2019t it inappropriate\nto state the intention of\nCouncil to proceed with\na campaign against the\nmodel before we\u2019d voted\nto against it? Regardless,\nvoting on options that we\nare presented with at the\nstart of a session is ludi-crous; there is no time to\nform a full opinion, which\nlimits the effectiveness of\nany debate.\nSecondly, after asking\nfor clari\ufb01cation about\nthis possible campaign, it\nbecame clear that despite\nCouncil recommending\nthis campaign, there\nwould be no explicit oversight by Council over the\nactions of this campaign.\nThe campaign would be\nencouraged to report to\nCouncil, but it would not\nbe directly responsible to\nCouncil. Why?\nIf Council is recommending that a\ncampaign is started, that\nis essentially a stamp of\napproval of the campaign,\nwrit large, regardless of\nwhether or not we as a\nCouncil actually endorse\nit. Regardless of whether\nor not that is true, that is\nhow it looks, and that is\nhow a campaign could\nargue: \u201cYou don\u2019t like our\nactions? Why not? You\nendorsed us.\u201d It\u2019s odd that\nCouncil would want to\nvote to create a campaign\nover which it would\nhave no oversight and in\nwhich members may not\nbe involved. If a student\nhad started a campaign\nindependently, we should\nde\ufb01nitely support them,\nand they should be free\nto campaign in whichever\nway they see \ufb01t. But\ncreating a campaign over\nwhich we would have no\noversight, but to which\nwe would put our name,\nis odd.\nClearly, the Union\nwishes to retain control\nover some aspect of the\ncampaign, or we wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone through a list of\ncampaign strategies and\nchosen which individual\noptions to endorse.\nWe should have chosen\na more de\ufb01nitive path.\nThe campaign should\neither be led and fully\nendorsed by the Union,\nor fully student-led. The\nidea here was to get a\n\u201cbest of both worlds\u201d\nscenario - a campaign that\nis student-led but with a\nlimited range of actions\nendorsed by Council.\nWhile a campaign would\ntechnically be able to\nproceed how they wanted\nto, the implication of\ncontrol from Council\nis clear. A student-led\ncampaign should be able\nto use their voice in any\nway they see \ufb01t, and\nnot be controlled by an\nexternal body of students\nwho are not necessarily\nheavily involved in the\ncampaign. But should this\ncampaign lead to an irreconcilable breakdown in\nnegotiations with College,\nthere is very little room\nfor Council to denounce\nR\nent prices in\nhalls is a tricky\ntopic. Almost\nevery elected\nrepresentative on Union\nCouncil, Imperial College\nUnion\u2019s highest elected\ndeliberative body, agrees\nthat the proposals that the\nCollege have delivered to\nthe Union Leadership are\nunacceptable. The original\nproposal would have seen\nrent in halls rise either by\n12.2% between 2019/20\nto 2020/21 followed by a\nyearly 2.5% \u201cin\ufb02ationary\u201d\nincrease until 2024/25,\nwhile the second proposal\nwould have resulted in a\nyearly average of 5.5%\nfrom 3 three years until\n2022/23, followed by the\nin\ufb02ationary increase of\n2.5% until 2024/25. The\nimplications here are dire,\nreaching >\u00a3300 pw for\nhalls in South Kensington\nby 2024. The \ufb01nancial\nmodel that College has\nproposed is allegedly\na \u201cbreak-even\u201d model,\nwith assumptions such\nas valuing the building\nas worth nothing after 50\nyears, not including pro\ufb01t\nfrom Pembridge, which\nis being retired, and applying in\ufb02ationary uplift\nto the part of the revenue\nused to pay off the loan\nand interest used to build\nthe new Kemp Porter halls\n(which does not increase\nwith in\ufb02ation). To us on\nCouncil, that model is unacceptable and certainly\nnot \u201cbreak-even\u201d.\nBut opposition to this\nis clear. Council has now\nrejected this model 3\ntimes, as the fundamental\nbasis of this model is\n\ufb02awed and the effects of\nimplementing it would be\ndisastrous no matter how\nyou tweak the numbers \u2013\nminor concessions cannot\noffset the damage that\nWe\u2019d Like to Make Our Discomfort Of\ufb01cial\n\u201cProviding a\nnew model\nmere hours\nbefore student\nrepresentatives are asked\nto vote on it\nis shameful\nand blatantly\ndisrespectful\u201d\nits actions, given that\nwe recommended its\ncreation.\nConcerns were raised\nabout Council oversight\nlimiting the impact and\nresponsiveness of the\ncampaign \u2013 and we\nagree. But endorsing the\ncreation of the campaign\nwithout having any\nexplicit control over\nits actions leads to an\nuncomfortable grey area\nwhere we can\u2019t really\nraise any concerns with\nthe campaign if things go\nsouth. We are now linked\nto the actions of any\ncampaign that starts, regardless of whether or not\nthey choose to adhere to\nthe strategies that Council\nchose to endorse.\nThis is not to say that\nwe think a campaign will\ngo south. We fully support\nthe right of students to use\ntheir voice how they see\n\ufb01t, and to \ufb01ght to make\nImperial a better place.\nBut Council should not\ninterfere in that voice. We\nshould either support our\nstudents with their endeavours or take a stand\nourselves, but the votes\non Tuesday 4th February\ncreated a neither-nor\nscenario where Council\nvoted to hand this matter\nover to an independent\ngroup of students. This\nin-between stance looks\nweak and jeopardises the\npower of the campaign,\nby both attempting to in\ufb02uence the actions of any\ncampaign that starts, but\nnot being of\ufb01cially spearheaded by the Union.\nOptions should have been\npresented in advance of\nthe meeting to give us\nmore time to consider\nthem before voting on\nthese matters.\nThis statement solely\nre\ufb02ects the opinions of\nChris Carter and Fatima\nKhan and does not re\ufb02ect\nthe opinion of the RSMU\nor CGCU Executive\nCommittees or the RSMU\nor CGCU as a whole.\n\n"

Furthermore,\nfor someone who has read\nthe novel and watched\nthe film, the final scene\nwas a surprising addition,\ndeviating from the book,\nthat rounded the film off\nperfectly poignantly.\nIt\u2019s hard to comment on\nthis award without having\nread the source material,\nand so we can\u2019t discuss\nthe other nominees.\nBest Supporting Actor & Actress\nWe think Brad Pitt\nshould get it, we want\nBrad Pitt to get it, and we\nthink Brad Pitt will get\nit. Arguably the leading\ncharacter in Once Upon\na Time... in Hollywood,\nBrad shone in his role as\nCliff Booth, Rick Dalton\u2019s\n(Leonardo DiCaprio)\nstunt double. Whilst Leo\nwas as consistently exceptional as ever, the fact that\nBrad Pitt stands out as the\nmain character in this film\ngives every indication that\nthis was an incredible per-formance, and he should\nreceive this award.\nLikewise for Laura\nDern: we think, we want,\nwe will get. With supporting roles in Little Women\nand Marriage Story, she\nhas opened herself up for\npraise this awards season,\ngiving two brilliant per-formances. For Marriage\nStory in particular, she\nwas hilarious, and despite\nhaving very little screen-time, she left lasting\nimpressions, providing\nlevity in an otherwise\nintense film.\nBest Cinematography\nAs Charlotte did for\nAdapted Screenplay, Dom\nshall do for Cinematography.\nIt goes without much\ndiscussion, that for me\nRoger Deakins (1917) is\nhighly deserving of Best\nCinematography this year.\nWhile other films excelled\nin picturesque shots,\nexcellent lighting, and\npleasing colour palettes,\n1917 had all three. It\u2019s\neasy to just focus on the\ncontinuous shot as the\nmain feature of this film,\nbut with dawn shots filling\nthe sky in deep blues, and\nburning buildings illuminating the set, there really\nwas the whole package\ndelivered here. The continuous shot just provided\nmore reason for praise,\nand left me wondering\nhow they did it.\nBest of the rest\nFor the remaining cat-egories, we don\u2019t really\nfeel qualified to talk as in\ndepth about them as we\nshould, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that we won\u2019t\nblindly try to.\nFor Best Score,\nwe\u2019d love to see Hildur\nGu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir take it home\nfor Joker; her string\narrangements provided\na refreshing take on the\nusual orchestrated scores.\nFor Best Costume\nDesign we have to give\nit to Jacqueline Durran\nfor Little Women, whose\npieces added a perfect\nprettiness to the film. An\nhonourable mention, and\nperhaps dark horse, goes\nto Arianne Phillips for\nOnce Upon a Time... in\nHollywood and her killer,\nlate 60\u2019s outfits (could be\nrefreshing to see this win).\nFor sheer transportation to the time period,\nwe have to give Best\nProduction Design to the\nteam on Once Upon a\nTime... in Hollywood; the\ndreamy 60\u2019s set just had\nus lusting to live in that\nera of Hollywood.\nHaving exhausted our\nword count, knowledge,\nand energy, we\u2019ve now\nrun out of space to blindly\nguess at who should\nreceive the Oscars this\nyear. In truth, we don\u2019t\nknow. And in honesty, we\ndon\u2019t care. Let\u2019s just see\non Sunday.\nColossal Driver and serious Johansson in Marriage Story // Netflix\n\n"

Among other\noccasions, he often distinguishes himself in debates\nin the House of Commons,\nsometimes without even\na word, like the time he\nwas reprimanded for lying\non the bench during the\nBrexit bill debate. He is\nnot new to controversy,\nparticularly those concerning his strict Catholic\nbeliefs and how they tie in\nwith his view of politics\nand economics.\nMr Rees-Mogg,\nvisitor to our university,\nshowed up a little late\nto the event, apparently\ndue to a cabinet meeting\nin which he and Mr\nJohnson were probably\ndiscussing new ways of\nmaking the UK great\nagain. After a brief introduction by the Chair\nof the Conservative\nSociety, he began his\nspeech which touched\non several points, from\nthe opportunities Brexit\noffers to the intolerance\nof socialists. He also\ntook the opportunity to\npraise Imperial College\nas one of the most outstanding universities in\nthe world, and that he\nbelieves in our success\nin any industry we enter.\nAfterwards, the\naudience was given\nthe opportunity to ask\nquestions and mine was\namong the ones chosen.\nHere\u2019s what I asked:\n\u201cYou have praised our\nuniversity for its international status. Now,\nwith Brexit having\njust occurred, which\nmeasures will be taken\nconcretely in order to\nguarantee that universities like Imperial, deeply\nreliant on EU staff\nand students, maintain\ntheir research level and\nindeed international\nstatus?\u201d\nIn his answer, Mr Rees-Mogg declared that\nuniversities are at the\nforefront of what will be\na \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, that\nthe UK should hence\nfocus in looking at countries like India, which\nrepresent the future,\nrather than at the \u201cnarrow-focused\u201d European\nUnion, which instead\nrepresents the past. He\nthen praised the ability\nof Imperial to fund itself\nthrough several sources\nrather than depending\nexclusively on public\nfinances. No words were\ndedicated to the fact\nthat the future of many\nresearch programmes\nin partnership with the\nnarrow-focused EU,\nwhich actually greatly\nbenefit British univer-sities, could come to an\nend depending on the\nresults of the impending\nnegotiations.\nAfter the question\nsession finished it was\ntime for the raffle. A\nseries of prizes were\noffered, which ranged\nfrom chauvinistic Union\nJacks to, more ironi-cally, EU gadgets and\nleftist books. Drawing\nthe winning tickers\nwas of course the guest\nof honor. With ticket\nnumber 152, I was lucky\nenough to win a copy of\n\u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d by Karl Marx\nand Friedrich Engels.\nPart of the prize was an\ninscription:\n\u201cLuca, This is not an\nimportant one. - Jacob\nRees-Mogg\u201d.\nAlthough overtly sa-tirical, I found it striking\nthat a person who studied\nhistory could write such\na statement, even as a\npoor joke. I am certainly\nnot a communist or a so-cialist, but I find absurd\nthat the work of a philosopher whose thought\nhas profoundly shaped\nthe last two centuries\nwhich Democrat Trump\nshould face in the US\npresidential elections,\nwhich minister should\nbe kicked out, and more.\nIn a question about\nwhat issue people most\nagreed with, at first\nplace was freedom of\nspeech, ranked above\ncapitalism, immigration\ncontrol, and Brexit.\nI thought about that\non my way home. While\nit is true that some\nfringes of the left are\ndeeply intolerant, it is\nalso true that that many\npeople on the right\nare too, one of them\ncurrently in Downing\nStreet. I then ask, can\u2019t\nthis invaluable freedom\nbe upheld without the\ndegrading the rigor of\npolitical debate with\nuseless, dangerous\noffenses and populist\nslogans?\nJacob Rees-Mogg answers questions from the audience // Isabelle Zhang\nis described as so. Not\nto mention the fact that\nthe person who wrote so\nhad also recently written\na book about the Victorian Age, the period\nin which Marx\u2019s theory\nand the entire socialist\nmovement developed\nand had clear impact.\nRight after having my\nnew book signed, I left\nas a queue formed to\ntake selfies and speak\nwith Mr Rees-Mogg.\nTo end these remarks\non a more positive\nnote, I would like to\nthank the Chair of the\nConservative Society\nfor giving me a chance\nto ask a question. I also\nrecognise that the event\nwas well organised and\nI cannot imagine how\nmuch effort was required\nto set it up. What was\nmemorable was the\nMentimeter poll set up at\nthe event\u2019s start, which\nasked questions such as:\nwhat the most important\nissues the government\nshould be dealing with,\n\u201cHe began his\nspeech... and\nalso took the\nopportunity to\npraise Imperial\nCollege as one\nof the most\noutstanding\nuniversities in\nthe world \u201d\n\u201cI was lucky\nenough to win\na copy of\u201cThe\nCommunist\nManifesto\u201d\nby Karl Marx\nand Friedrich\nEngels as a\nraffle prize \u201d\n\n"

The\nevent attracted over 200\nstudents, filling up the\nrows of CAGB 200 in a\nmanner not usually seen\nat a lecture theatre for\nMechanical Engineering\nstudents. Though most\nattendees were Imperial\nstudents, there were\nsome Imperial staff and\nexternal visitors present\nas well. The event ended\nwith a group photo-op of\nthe audience members\nwith Rees-Mogg.\nPrior to Rees-Mogg's\narrival, Felix had the\nchance to interview some\nmembers of the audience.\nWe asked attendees what\nparty they voted for in the\nlast election, how active\nthey were politically,\ntheir thoughts on Rees-Mogg, and their view\nof STEM-centric Imperial\nas a space for political dis-cussion. The responses we\nreceived are by no means\ncomprehensive, but they\nare nonetheless inform-ative. Unsurprisingly,\nmajority of interviewees\nvoted Conservative in the\nlast election, though many\ndid not vote for Johnson\nin the leadership election.\nMost interviewees were\npolitically active to some\nextent, either as a member\nof a political Party, or at\nleast engaged enough to\nvote in leadership elections and keep up with\ncurrent political affairs.\nResponses tell us that\npeople do not think of\nImperial as a particularly\npolitical environment,\nthough they also say this\ndoesn\u2019t mean Imperial\npeople are politically\nabstinent, rather just\npolitically active behind\nclosed doors. Some also\nmentioned that Imperial,\nnot unlike other universi-ties, may seem more tolerant of left-wing opinions\nthan right-wing ones; but\nothers say Imperial is actually quite civil. Overall,\nthere seems to be demand\nfor more political events\nat Imperial to engage students with more of these\ndiscussions.\nThe members of the\naudience were fairly en-amoured by Rees-Mogg.\nKane, a Brexit party voter\nappreciated Rees-Mogg\nfor his honesty, whilst\nTom, a Conservative voter\nand party member, liked\nhim for his policies and\nfound him entertaining\nof him and were hoping to\nfind out by attending.\nOnce Rees-Mogg\narrived, he provided a\nbrief 10-minute speech\nsummarising his views.\nFor the remainder of\nthe session, Rees-Mogg\nanswered questions from\naudience members, about\nhis politics and his poli-cies.\nFelix asked Rees-Mogg\nfor his opinion on the\ncreation of a new Liberation Officer position, a\nWorking-Class Liberation\nOfficer, by Imperial\nCollege Union. He stated\nthat he did not believe\npeople from different\nbackgrounds should be\ntreated differently or\ngiven special treatment,\nbut he respected that Imperial College Union, as\na Democratic institution,\nwas entitled to do as it\ndesired.\nRees-Mogg fielded\nmany other questions\non the dangers of being\na young Conservative\nat university, a potential\nunion between Canada,\nAustralia New Zealand\nand the UK, liberalising\ndrug laws, and proportional representation.\nOn the matter of HS2\nRees-Mogg plead the fifth\nand refused to comment\non the ongoing renewal of\nthe massively costly infrastructure project. A clear\nhighlight for the audience\nwas the memorable quote\non the subject of his\nactivity on social media,\n\u201cTwitter was really quite\nfun, as you can really\nwind up the Left!\u201d, which\nled to much laughter and\napplause.\nFollowing the Q &\nA, Rees-Mogg drew the\nwinning raffle tickets,\nwith an amusing selection\nof prizes. Amongst others,\nRees-Mogg presented a\ncopy of the Communist\nManifesto, European and\nUnion flags, and of course\nan obligatory bottle of\nwine.\nOverall, the Chair of\nImperial College Conservative Society, Marwan\nRiach stated that the event\nwent \u201cvery well, with\ngood turnout.\u201d He was\nalso pleased about the lack\nof disruption to the event\noffered by other left-wing\nsocieties such as Imperial\nLeft Forum or Labour\nSociety. When asked\nabout other Conservative\nParty matters, such as\ntheir affiliation with the\nrather right-wing Turning\nPoint UK, Riach stated\nthat Imperial College\nConservative Party was\nno longer associated with\nthe group.\nThe event concluded\nwith a group photo of the\nImperial Conservatives\nwith Rees-Mogg following attempts. Doubtless,\nthe best moment of the\nevening was a photo opportunity with Felix. We\nhope Rees-Mogg picks up\na copy of the paper in the\nfuture.\nOccasionally referred\nto as the Honorable\nMember for the 18th\nCentury, Rees-Mogg is\na controversial figure in\nmodern British politics.\nHe chaired the highly\nEurosceptic European\nResearch Group until\nSeptember 2019, widely\nviewed as propelling\nthe UK towards Brexit,\nand generally stands\non the fiscal and social\nright of the Conservative\nParty. Currently Lord\nPresident of the Council,\nRees-Mogg has a large\nfollowing amongst young\nmembers of the Conservative Party, appreciating\nhis upper-class diction\nand mannerisms, with a\nlarge social media following and even a group\nnamed Moggmentum in\nhis honour.\nRees-Mogg Presenting with the audience // ISabelle Zhang\n\u201cMembers\nof the\naudience were\nenamoured by\nRees-Mogg,\nappreciating\nhis honesty,\nmannerisms,\nand politics \u201d\nand charismatic. Joseph,\na voter from Northern\nIreland has followed\nRees-Mogg for years\nand \u201cloves him 100%.\u201d\nHowever, this adoration\nwas by no means uni-versal; a Labour voter\ndubbed him a societal\nproblem and of course,\nanother member of the\naudience strongly disliked\nhis views on Brexit.

However,\nunlike Microsoft, Sony\ndidn\u2019t reveal the actual\nconsole. Rather, it\u2019s\nrumoured that Sony is set\nto reveal it at a special\nevent later this month or\nearly next month. Since\nthe teaser, fans have been\nspeculating the price,\ndesign, launch titles, and\nspecifications of the high-ly-anticipated device.\nIt\u2019s also rumoured\nthat Sony would wait for\nMicrosoft to launch the\nSeries X first and then\ndetermine the price of the\nPS5. Although, Microsoft\ndoesn\u2019t seem too worried\nabout Sony or Nintendo;\nin a recent interview,\nXbox head Phil Spencer\nsaid that \u201cAmazon and\nGoogle are Xbox\u2019s real\ncompetition.\u201d Microsoft\nis trying to push Xbox\nover to the cloud with\nits Azure cloud infrastructure through Project\nxCloud. Thus, Microsoft\nis, in essence, directly\ncompeting with other\ncompanies that have\nworld-class cloud infrastructures and a focus on\ngaming; these companies\ninclude Google, Amazon,\nand even Apple.\nSony and Nintendo,\non the other hand, are\nmore traditional com-panies, focusing on\ncreating products rather\nthan shifting to services.\nComing back to the PS5,\nit looks to have great\nbackwards compatibility\nwith the PS4 and highly\nnew galaxy foldable - the\nGalaxy Z flip - have all\nbeen leaked both through\nSamsung themselves as\nwell as through other\nsources. At this point,\nit looks like the idea of\nhaving an event about\nthe devices seems pretty\ninsignificant considering\nthat almost everything\nhas been leaked about\nthe devices, down to their\nprices and even colours.\nAnyways, the Z Flip is\nset to be a direct competitor to the Motorola Razr\nand features a tall 6.7\u201d\nfoldable display. From the\nrumours and leaks, it looks\nlike Samsung has learned\nfrom its experience with\nthe Galaxy Fold as the\nnew device promises to\nbe much more durable\nand reliable in the long\nrun. Further, it is set to be\npriced lower than the Fold\nand higher than the S20\nseries. One disadvantage\nwith a foldable, though,\nis that you\u2019re paying for\nthe form factor rather than\nfor the specifications.\nThe Z flip would run\non the older Snapdragon\n855+ processor, not have\na 5G variant, have a\nbattery capacity of 3300\nmAh, and only possess a\nmAh and 5000 mAh,\nand feature rectangular\ncamera modules (similar\nto those on the iPhone\n11 series and the Pixel 4\nseries) with around 3 to\n4 cameras. Furthermore,\nthese phones are rumoured\nto have a buttery-smooth\n120 Hz OLED displays\nwith an Infinity-O cutout.\nThe S20 line, in general,\nwould resemble the\nthe Note 10 series. The\nGalaxy Unpacked event is\nless than a week away, so\nget ready for a rather fresh\ndose of android flagships.\nOculus Quest Gains\nHand Tracking Feature\nLate last year, Oculus\u2019s\nQuest VR headset\nreceived a software update\nthat enables the device to\ntrack its wearer\u2019s hands.\nThis experimental feature\nmakes use of the onboard\ncameras to track the\nuser\u2019s hands for a more\nnatural, immersive, and\ncontroller-free gaming ex-perience. A recent update\nmakes the experience\nmuch better for end-users;\nhowever, there isn\u2019t really\nmuch to do with the hand\nIn an effort to encourage people to switch to\nelectric vehicles, the UK\ngovernment has planned\nto ban the sale of gasoline\ncars and hybrids by 2035,\nfive years earlier than\nplanned. Prime Minister\nBoris Johnson said that\n\u201cThere can be no greater\nresponsibility than\nprotecting our planet.\u201d\nThis shows commitment\ntowards a positive change\nthat may influence other\ncountries and would certainly benefit our planet\nenvironmentally. These\ncars can still be sold on the\nused market, but you can\nexpect heavy road taxes\nand fuel charges. With\nNorway, Netherlands,\nFrance, and even India on\na similar track, it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time before the\nrest of the world follow\nsuit.\n\u201cAmazon and\nGoogle are\nXbox\u2019s real\ncompetiton\u201d\nimpressive performance\nupgrades. The console\u2019s\nprocessor is based on\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen architecture and its graphics would\nbe powered by a custom\nAMD Navi GPU. Like the\nXbox Series X, the PS5\nwould ditch hard-drives\nfor solid-state-drives;\ngames would now launch\nmuch faster and load\ntimes would reduce sig-nificantly. Furthermore,\nthe PS5 is confirmed to\nbe backwards compatible\nwith the PS4, meaning\nthat most of your old PS4\ngames would still run on\nthe PS5. In addition, most\nof the games released\nin the next year would\nbe cross-generational,\nmeaning that they would\nstill run on both generations of consoles.\nSamsung Galaxy Z\nFlip & S20 Series\nSamsung seems to\nhave been facing a lot of\nproblems with containing\nthe excitement for it\u2019s\nnext range of flagships.\nThe Galaxy S20 series\nof phones as well as the\nOculus Quest Hand Tracking // Oculus\n\u201cA natural,\nimmersive,\ncontroller-free\nexperience\u201d\ntracking apart from navigating the user interface\nand using it to control the\ndevice\u2019s built-in, native\napplications.

There\nmay be a fleeting moment where the\nsquare, snugly wrapped\npresent could still be a\nbox of chocolates, but\nthat thought is quickly\ndiscarded on picking it\nup \u2013 even the priciest\nchoccies are no match for\na book in weight.\nI received one such\ngift this Christmas,\nexcitement dimming the\nmoment I sussed out\nwhat it was. But I was too\nhasty in my judgement,\nas this book \u2013 Women\nin Science: 50 Fearless\nPioneers who Changed\nthe World, by Rachel\nIgnotofsky \u2013 turned out to\nbe a delightful eye opener.\nPublished in 2017, it\nwas bang-on trend with\nthe meteoric prominence\ngiven to women, in virtually any sphere of life. By\nnow, moving into 2020,\nyou could be forgiven for\nan eyeroll at a bandwag-on-jumping title \u2013 yes,\nyes, we all know science\nis for women too (and if\nyou don\u2019t, where have you\nbeen hiding?!). I\u2019ll admit\nto being a tad sceptical\nmyself.\nSo yes, the title may be\na bit of an obvious hook.\nHowever, once I actually\nsettled down to read it,\nthe real selling point was\nstill there, hidden in that\ntitle \u2013 fearless pioneers.\nIrrespective of their\ngender, the individuals\nIgnotofsky profiles in her\nbook are the forgotten\ngeniuses, overlooked by\nhistory \u2013 and yes, in some\ninstances buried behind\na more prominent male\nscientist, but it is their\nachievements, not just\ntheir gender, that burns off\nthe page.\nHow could it be that I\nhadn\u2019t heard of Hertha\nAyrton, whose success\nimproving electrical street\nlights used in Victorian\nBritain forced the Royal\nSociety to let her, a\nwoman, present a paper\nthere? Or the American\ngeneticist, Nettie Stevens,\nwho discovered sex\nwas determined by our\nchromosomes? What\nabout Chien-Shiung Wu,\nwho disproved the law\nof conservation of parity\nconcerning radioactive\natoms?\nEach of these profiles is\naccompanied by a page-wide stylised drawing\nof the woman under the\nspotlight, busy with some\nsort of scientific activity.\nIgnotofsky both authors\nand illustrates the book.\nThe era-appropriate\noutfits are a nice touch,\nshowing off the diversity\nof these individuals from\nwomen in Greek togas\nto Renaissance period\nclothing, modern-day\nsuits, astronaut gear, and,\nof course, white lab-coats.\nIt makes a clear statement\nthat women have been advancing science for over a\nmillennium, and yet were\nconsistently written out of\npopular history.\nQuotes, diagrams,\nand factoid captions are\nsprinkled liberally across\nthe pages, crowding the\nmargins, making for a\nteenage-girl-diary feel that\nprobably reflects the target\naudience of the book. The\nadditional information\nclustered there definitely\npiques interest, whatever\nthe design intent.\nThe short one-page\nprofiles make for sporadic\nreading, and given this\namount of novel information crammed into\neach one, it\u2019s probably\nbest to limit reads to a\nfew women a day for\nmaximum assimilation.\nBut far be it from me to\nput limits on you!\nI shall, however, recommend a read.\nNettie Stevens // Christine\nParry\nForgotten scientists: Battle for the sexes \u2013 Nettie\nStevens\nN\nettie Stevens\nis not a household name,\nyet her discovery of how sex is\ndetermined is common\nhousehold knowledge.\nBorn in Vermont in 1861,\nNettie graduated at 19 to\nbecome a teacher before\nfurther pursuing her studies and enrolling at Bryn\nMawr College in her late\n30\u2019s.\nThanks to Nettie\u2019s\nwork, we now know that\nthe 23rd\npair of chromosomes in humans varies\nbetween male and female\nas XY or XX, respec-tively. Nettie Stevens\u2019\nmajor paper in the field\nof cytology, the study\nof cells, was written in\n1904 with the 1933 Nobel\nPrize winner, Thomas\nHunt Morgan, a geneticist\nand zoologist.

The\noversized black T-shirts\nand the cheeky smile.\nThere are few bigger\nand more recognisable\nbrands in electrinic music\nright now than Jordon\nAlexander. With him\nkicking off the year by releasing two EPs in quick\nsuccession, it seems like\na good time to see how\nhis sound has changed\nover the past year, and\nwhat that might mean for\nthe future. One thing is\nfor certain \u2013 the broody\novertones of his newest\nreleases haven\u2019t come\nout of nowhere. Looking\nback, it was a dank and\ngrimy set in the sweltering\nParisian summer when I\nfirst saw him.\nHe\u2019s always had a\nspecial energy in his live\nsets. The kind of energy\nthat separates those who\ncan command a dancefloor from pretenders. The\nsun was beating down on\nthe plastic tarpaulin of\nthe little open tent which\ngave shelter to fans of\nanything with a four to\nthe floor at this mainly\nrock-y festival. All eyes\nwere fixed on the slightly\nraised, rudimentary metal\nplatform holding the DJ\nbooth. It almost felt like\nthe cigarettes he was\nsmoking were a wise\nchoice to filter out all\nthe dust in the air. The\nepitome of focus, he kept\nhis moves simple. A little\nback and forth, a little hair\nflick here and there. Eyes\nalways on the decks. Like\ntwo gleaming lumps of\ncoal.\nThe 26-year-old seems\nto be maturing into a\nsuperstar. Having put\nout EPs quite prolifically\nsince becoming one of\nthe symbols of the lo-fi\nhouse movement, he has\nrecently announced that\nwe should expect a full-length album debut from\nhim at the end of this year.\nBy all indications, his\nlo-fi days (a serendipitous\nsonic achievement eventually copied by everyone\nand their dog - now\nsomething he wishes not\nto identify with) are over.\nThe shift in his sound\nstarted with the release of\nthe EP Moogie in May of\nlast year. Having collaborated with his long-time\nfriend and old roommate,\nNite Fleit, the record\ncarried on from his earlier\nrelease that year under\nhis birth name. Carrying\na cover adorned with\nsomething resembling\nradioactive jellyfish, the\nEP was not an explosive\nrelease in any sense but it\ndid indicate a new trend.\nUp to that point, it seemed\nthat with every release,\nAlexander was trying to\nchange the soundscape\na little bit, while staying\nwithin the sample house\ncategory. It seemed as\nthough he was trying to\nevade being pinned down\ntoo much \u2013 a feat which\nhas definitely cemented\nhis status as one of the\nmore eclectic producers\nof this era. With Growing\nPains following Moogie\nafter a matter of months,\nhe had added another\nEP of the same ilk to his\ndiscography. Describing\nit as \u201cHeadbanging club\nmusic\u201d it was an improvement over Moogie.\nHe kept the rave sound\nand made it more glitchy,\nadding an interesting new\nlayer to the sound. The\nopening track, sleepless,\nstole the show, with\nits swampy intro and\noff-kilter kick during the\nbreakdown.\nIn December, he\nreleased an EP called\nDon\u2019t Keep The Fire\nBurning completely out\nof the blue as a response\nto the wildfires in Australia. Coming from someone\nwho likes to tease fans\nby playing perpetually\nunreleased material in\nlive sets, this 4-track\nnugget seemed like pure\ngold. The opener, Positive\nEnergy Forever is a\nthumperofatrack.Agritty\ncombination of a bass\ndistorted to oblivion, a\nnicely rhythmic arpeggio\nand the perfectly faded\nvocal sample drearily repeating \u201cpositive energy\u201d\nculminate in dancefloor\nhypnosis The metallic\noohs and ahs panning\nin and out, paired with\nthe breakbeat hats and\nMUSIC\nMUSIC\nISSUE 1742\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Editor\nstomping kick, along with\nthe tempo increase we\nalready saw on his last\nfew efforts shows all go\na long way to confirming\nthat Jordon has managed\nto find what he had been\nlooking for.\nExactly what that is\ncan be surmised from his\nstatements regarding his\nmusical influence. He had\nhad no problems showing\nhis love for old-school\nhouse, disco (in his\nreleases with another one\nof his friends, Loods), and\neven grime (in the aptly\ntitled I\u2019ve Always Liked\nGrime). The Sunflower\nEP, released last Friday,\nis an indication that he\ntruly has embraced the\nheavier side of electronic\nmusic as well. The title\ntrack flirts with rave but\nonly ever so slightly, in\nthe form of woodwind\nsynths which brush your\neardrums at the peak\nof the track, when the\nkick really bites down.\nThe next track, Hidden\nWorlds, feature synths\nwhich would not sound\nout of place at the peak\nacid-era Hacienda. On\nSwitchblade, he reverts to\na sample-based paradigm\nmore like his previous\nsound. That is not the\nmain reason for the track\nbeing the most unimpressive of the bunch, as it\nalso sounds flat in many\nparts. Luckily, he still\nmanages to finish with\na flourish with Leaving\nTokyo. The opening bars\nsound like a cell phone\nringing underwater, and\nthen the broken beat\ncomes and sweeps you\naway for four minutes\nand seventeen seconds of\nelectro apocalypse.\nMallGrabhasbecomea\nworldwide phenomenon.\nSunflower was recorded\nin what he says are two of\nhis favourite cities - New\nYork and Tokyo - but it\nis the grittiness of his\nhometown, the industrial port of Newcastle,\nAustralia, which shines\nthrough. It will certainly\nbe interesting to see how\nmany different sounds\nand styles he manages to\nincorporate into his full-length debut and whether\nhe\u2019ll be able to make it fit\ntogether into a coherent\nwhole. That will, surely,\nbe a pivotal step on his\nseemingly celestial rise.\nThe track sunflower was composed in New York, looking over the skyline on an\nincredibly sunny day// Looking For Trouble Recordings\nBilnky Bill\u2019s Adventures in Bushfireland // Looking For Trouble Recordings\n\n"

    "content": "Taylor Swift: Miss Americana\nThedocumentarydeliversanintimatesideofTaylorSwift,withherbattlingwitheatingdisorder,genderinequality,\nthe entertainment industry, public feuds, politics and privacy, and finally who she has come to be.\nA\ns a Swifty\nmyself I anticipated her\ndocumentary\nwith silent gasps and\nscreams since the release\nof the trailer - she is an\nartist with whom I have\ngrown up; every album\nof hers reminds me of a\ndistinct part of my own\njourney. Having a lens\ninto the behind-the-scenes\nof her journey is something I\u2019m sure many of\nus looked forward to. But\nat the same time, I could\nnot help but wonder what\nI could expect since, as\na celebrity, a huge part\nof her life is already\npublic. Nevertheless, the\ndocumentary fulfills its\npurpose, delivering a soft\nand endearing narrative\nand filling in the missing\npieces of who we perceive\nTaylor Swift to be.\nThe Netflix film is\nstructured chronologically and describes her\nstruggles and revelations\nin every stage of her life,\nstarting off with her debut\nand early success, where\nshe lived for the approval\nof others. Instead of confronting her insecurities\nhead on, she interpreted it\nas a sign that she needed to\nwork hard to be deserving,\nwhich translated into her\ndiligent work ethic and\nbody image issues. Even\nat the peak of her career,\nshe recalled, she had no\none to share that with.\n\u201cIt fulfills\nits purpose,\ndelivering\na soft and\nendearing\nnarrative\u201d\nThat insecurity is deeply\nrooted in how women are\ntreated unequally especially in the entertainment\nindustry, which is why\nnow she has chosen to\nstand up and voice out her\nstance.\nIt covers many controversial incidents or\n\u201cfeuds\u201d in which Swift\nwas involved, from Kanye\nWest interrupting her\nspeech at the 2009 MTV\nVideo Music Awards,\nher switch from country\nto pop music, her feud\nresulting #TaylorSwiftO-verParty trending all over\nthe internet, and her sexual\nassault case against David\nMueller. In MissAmericana, we get a peek into her\nside of the story, which is\noften raw and vulnerable.\nWe\u2019ve had glimpses in the\npast, but this gives us a\nclear answer, a transparent\noutlook to her personal\nlife.\nAs a documentary\ncentered around a pop\nartist, the music is perfectly intertwined with every\nscene. I like how various\nforms of the songs are\nincorporated - the studio\nversion, live stages at\nher concert, or a random\nrecording playing from\nher phone. Almost every\nfavourite song of mine\nwas included, including\n\u201cTim McGraw\u201d, \u201cAll\nToo Well,\u201d and \u201cGetaway\nCar.\u201d The fact that she\nwrites every song on her\nalbum not only shows\nhow talented she is as an\nartist but also reflects all\nparts of her journey - you\ncan hear her screaming her\nloneliness in \u201cDelicate,\u201d\nher transformation from\nhatred to love in \u201cCall It\nWhat You Want,\u201d her true\njoy and contentedness in\nher album Lover. Music\nnever lies, and Swift\u2019s\nspeaks to her audience\nso sincerely. The new\nsong \u201cOnly the Young\u201d\nincluded is such an\ninspiring, upbeat, and motivational political anthem\nthat exemplifies the new\nand reborn Taylor.\nThe highlight of Miss\nAmericana to me personally is certainly towards\nthe end when Taylor Swift\nchooses to go public with\nthe her political views,\nfrom her urging her\nyounger audience to vote\nto her staunch stance for\nthe LGBT community.\nIt\u2019s truly a change from\nher strict apolitical profile\nin the past. Without her\nconstant need to be the\n\u201cnice girl,\u201d she\u2019s now\nfree to express her views,\nunafraid of the potential\nbacklashes like the Dixie\nChicks received. The shift\nis not sudden or without\nreason, but is rather a\nresult of her going through\nthe David Mueller case.\nIt\u2019s evident that she\u2019s\ntired of being in a position\ncapable of change and\nimpact but not do it.\nAll in all, Miss Americana delivers to the fan\nsomething that we\u2019ve all\nwanted, the metamorphosis of the country\nTaylor in her sparkly\ndress and cowboy boots\nto the 29-year-old Taylor\nin her pajamas set, eating\nburritos and speaking\nup against misogyny. It\ntouches on topics, including some centered around\nmental health - dealing\nwith the fear of not being\ngood enough, the desire to\nbe liked, building our self-worth on others\u2019 approval,\nwhile others more societal\nand representative of contemporary female artists,\ncelebrities, and public\nshaming. It\u2019s not the\nstrongest of documentaries nor the most touching\nof topics, but nevertheless\nit\u2019s a genuine, compelling,\nand vulnerable watch\nthat I\u2019ll recommend to\neveryone.\nTaylor Swift with her adorable cat opens Miss Americana // Netflix\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTV Editor\nCreator: Lana Wilson,\nMorgan Neville, Caitrin\nRogers, Christine O\u2019Malley\nStarring: Taylor Swift\n\n"

The\n26th of January was to be\nthe day in which populism\nwould either continue its\nstreak of triumph or be\nhalted in its tracks, and\nthe people of EmiliaRomagna delivered\ntheir message. While the\npeople of the other region\nin which elections were\nheld, Calabria, voted as\nforecasted in polls, with\na remarkable majority\n(25%) for the centre-right\ncoalition, the former\nregion con\ufb01rmed its septuagenarian tradition.\nslim victory of around 2%\nto 4%.\nThe result is seen as\nthe first major political\nsetback for Matteo\nSalvini\u2019s far-right\nLeague on the national\nstage. He spoke during\nelection night, along\nwith defeated candidate\nLucia Borgonzoni,\ndenying any possible\nmistake that could have\nled to the election loss.\nHe instead claimed that\nthe party was on the right\npath, having obtained\nmassive support in a\nregion which has always\nbeen a bastion of the\nleft. More recently he\nhas been questioned\nby some party figures,\namong them the League\nfounder and now estranged leader Umberto\nBossi, although such\ncriticisms from the party\nveteran are nothing new.\nSalvini\u2019s status as party\nleader has, however, not\nbeen seriously endan-gered, nor it is likely to\nbecome so.\nWhat these results\nhave achieved is an\nincreased stability of\nthe national govern-ment, which could have\ncollapsed in the case of\nthe League\u2019s victory.\nCurrently, the government is a coalition\nbetween the centre-left,\nplurality winning Democratic Party (PD), and\nthe populist Five Star\nMovement (M5S). The\nlatter party was almost\nannihilated in Emilia-Romagna, winning\njust over 3% of the vote.\nFurthermore, M5S is\ncurrently the strongest\nforce in the Italian\nparliament. Whilst PD\u2019s\nvictory has strengthened\ntheir commitment to\ngoverning, M5S\u2019s loss\nhas deepened their fear\nof a similar national\nelection performance.\nThe Democratic Party\nnow holds most of the\ncards. M5S\u2019s embarrassing result is not their\nfirst: their candidates\nhave also been recently\ncrushed in regions such\nas Calabria.\nAn internal process\nfor M5S to assimilate\nthe bad news and\nchannel it into reshaping\nthe party has no doubt\nbegun, and it is likely to\ndeeply shake the party\u2019s\ninternal structure. Under\nthis restructuring, the\nformer political leader\nof the M5S, Luigi Di\nMaio, has fallen victim:\nhe has been forced to\nresign as leader but\nretains his role in the\ngovernment as Foreign\nMinister.\nlives rather than living\nunder public spotlight.\nThis announcement\nreminds one of the\nRoman hero Cincinnatus, who served his\ncountry loyally through\nthe darkest hour and then\nretired to a life outside\nthe public eye. It was\nnonetheless announced\nin a statement which\nends in a declaration\nthat now is time to \u201cget\ntheir hands dirty\u201d; their\nbattle against populism\ntherefore seems not to\nbe just a parenthesis\nin the thick book of\nItalian politics but is\ndestined to continue.\nLooking at the calendar,\nthis assumption seems\nto be confirmed by the\nfact that more regional\nelections will take place\nlater this year, and in\nmany cases the League\nand the centre-right will\ntry to win such regions,\npossibly striking a fatal\nblow to the government.\nAs Italian politics is\ndeeply unpredictable,\nthe government\u2019s\nstrength could indeed be\neroded in the long term\nby the shifting equilibria\nevidenced above.\nThe first major defeat\nfor the League has nevertheless shown that Mr\nSalvini is not unbeatable,\nnor is populism. There\nis hence a possibility\nthat this may mark the\nbeginning of its decline,\nor its transformation\ninto something else, for\nbetter or for worse.\nElectoral map of Emilia-Romagna, with centre-right in blue and centre-left in red\n// Wikimedia\n\u201cPopulist\nparty M5S\nwas almost\nannihilated\nin EmiliaRomagna,\nwinning just\nover 3% of the\nvote\u201d\nMeanwhile, the\n\u201cSardines\u201d, the political movement born\nin Emilia-Romagna to\noppose populism and\nthe League, has been\ncredited for its role in\nsuccessfully bringing\nback more moderate\nvoters to the political\ndebate.

I don\u2019t envy\nteenagers today, who\nhear about catastrophic\nfires and global protests\nevery single day. I, on\nthe other hand, didn\u2019t\nhear too much about\nclimate change and\ncould safely deny (in the\npassive, personal sense)\nthat it was happening, as\nmany people continue to\ndo today (sometimes in\na less passive manner).\nI started an undergraduate degree in Manchester, close enough\nto my hometown that I\ncould go back to work\nthe odd Saturday shift\nat my uncle\u2019s shop. I\nbecame involved in\nenvironmental activism.\nAs I learned about the\nclimate crisis, I became\nemployed every one of\nmy family members.\nWe are all very proud of\nwhat he has achieved.\nBut at some point the\nhypocrisy of promoting\nclimate activism and\nworking in the meat\nindustry became too\nmuch for me. The day\nthat I finally declared\nI was going vegetarian\n- and for what reasons\n- there was a lot of\nconfusion. Whilst it is\nperfectly understandable that my uncle would\nbe defensive about my\nreasons, I am of the\nbelief that everyone is\nentitled to their own\nlifestyle choices and that\nthis should be respected.\nI do not criticise others\nfor eating meat, so I\ndon\u2019t expect to be criticised for making the\nopposite choice. I am\nhappy to say that my\nuncle and I are able to\ntalk quite openly about\nthese topics. Once he\neven recommended a\nrestaurant to me for its\nvegetarian options!\nThere is no one reason\nthat people choose to\nbe vegan; reducing\nanimal suffering, health\nbenefits and consciousness about the contribution to climate change\nare driving forces in\ndiffering proportions.\nWhilst I focus mainly on\nthe latter aspect in this\ncolumn, there is a lot to\nbe said regarding how\nveganism can help both\nhuman and non-human\nanimals alike.\nThe vast majority of\nthe energy available\nto us on Planet Earth\ncomes - directly or indirectly - from the sun. A\nproportion of this energy\nis taken on by plants as\nthey photosynthesize,\nconverting the solar\nenergy into chemical\nenergy. Herbivorous\nand omnivorous animals\nare able to tap into\nthis chemical energy\nby eating plant matter,\nalthough the process\nis not perfect - plenty\nof the energy is wasted\nduring the consumption\nprocess. The same can\nbe said for when carnivorous and omnivorous\nanimals consume other\nanimals lower down the\nfood chain. Ultimately,\nwe observe that the\ntotal energy required\nto provide a carnivore\nwith one calorie is generally greater than that\nrequired to provide one\ncalorie to a herbivore.\nThe great advantage\nof human omnivory is\nthat we get to choose!\nBy choosing a more\nherbivorous diet, we\nare able to reduce\nthe amount of energy\nrequired to grow our\nfood. That means fewer\nlinks in the food chain,\nsmaller transportation\nnetworks and increased\nscope for ultra-efficient\ngrowing methods, such\nas vertical farming. Each\nof these aspects comes\nwith a reduced carbon\nfootprint, compared with\nconventional livestock\nfarming.

Under this\nsystem, the EU allows\nthird countries access\nto its financial markets\nif countries\u2019 regulations\nalign with the EU\u2019s regulatory framework. The\nChancellor has stated that\nthis system allows the UK\nto adopt its own regula-tions, but it must ensure\ntheir outcomes are equivalent to those produced by\nthe EU\u2019s rulebook. This\napproach will certainly\nprovide more flexibility to\nthe UK. However, there is\nno guarantee that the EU\nwill agree to this plan.\nEven if it does agree with\nit, the EU will probably\nbe able to limit Britain\u2019s\naccess in the case of\nregulatory divergence.\nThe government expects\nan agreement on the form\nof the future relationship\nto be finalized by the end\nof the year, which many\nconsider an overly ambitious deadline.\nThe Case for Alignment\nThe case for remaining\nas aligned as possible\nwith EU regulations is\nnot difficult to argue for.\nEstablished financial\ninstitutions will face\nsignificant obstacles\nin offering services to\nEuropean customers if\nthe UK were to no longer\nhave access to European\nfinancial markets. Consequently, the trend of\nrelocation to competing\nfinancial centres, such\nas Frankfurt and Paris,\nwould significantly exac-erbate, thus endangering\na larger number of jobs in\nthe sector. Having to deal\nwith two widely different\nlegal frameworks would\ncertainly discourage inter-strive to ensure their\nproducts comply with\nboth EU and UK rules, in\naddition to the costs due\nto the trade barriers that\nwill be likely be intro-duced. All these costs will\neventually result in higher\nprices for consumers and\na reduction in earnings,\nwhich will discourage investment from the public\nin these companies.\nThe Case for Divergence\nDiverging from EU\nregulations will not necessarily be harmful to all\nsectors of the economy.\nParticularly, the technology sector could benefit\nfrom a shift away from the\ncurrent European frame-work, which is viewed as\nrestrictive by many voices\nin the tech community.\nRecent examples include\narticles 11 and 13 of the\ncontroversial copyright\nlaw along with announcements about banning the\nuse of facial recognition\nin public spaces. By\ndiverging from EU\nstandards, the UK could\nbecome a testing ground\nfor upcoming technolo-gies, such as driverless\ncars, robotics, and AI.\nThis spur of technological innovation would\nalso benefit the fintech\nsector Tailoring new\ntechnologies to the needs\nof the banking sector\nwould facilitate further\ngrowth and more effective\ncompetition with China\nand the US, regardless\nof whether access to EU\nmarkets has been maintained or not. The UK\u2019s\nleading pharmaceutical\nindustry could be further\nboosted in the case of\ndivergence. The ability of\nthe UK to develop its own\nregulations for pharmaceutical products would\nfacilitate harmonisation\nwith the regulatory regime\nof other nations, whose\nmarkets UK pharmaceutical companies want to\naccess post-Brexit. Given\nthat UK\u2019s Medicines and\nHealthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\nis a highly respected\nbody worldwide, the EU\nwill most likely wish to\ncontinue its cooperation\nwith it. As a result, the UK\nwould maintain a large\nnumber of EU rules, while\ncrafting others of its own\nin an effort to back British\ninterests. It is hence\npossible that both sectors\ncould represent significant\ninvesting opportunities\nmoving forward.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, it is\napparent that a nuanced\napproach should be\nadopted. The UK should\nbe careful not to diverge\njust for the sake of it; a\nsudden shift in policy will\nlikely cause significant\nshort and medium-term\ndamage, especially in\nfinancial services and\nexport-dependent sectors.\nSecuring a trade deal\nwith the US, which is\nfrequently cited as the\nmain argument in favour\nof extensive deregulation,\nmay require a policy shift\nin industries such as food\nprocessing. Deregulating\nsuch a sector would face\nopposition from a broad\nswathe of public opinion.\nConsidering that the list\nof the top ten UK export\ndestinations includes\nseven EU countries, and\nSwitzerland, which is a\nmember of the European\nEconomic Area, a sudden\ndisruption in trading\nrelationships due to divergence from European\nstandards would likely\noffset or even outweigh\nthe gains expected by\nthis decision. All of these\nfactors suggest it would\nbe in the interests of the\nUK \u2018s economy for the\ncountry to remain in close\nalignment with the EU, at\nleast in the short term.\n\u201cDiverging\nfrom EU\nregulations\nwill not\nnecessarily be\nharmful to all\nsectors of the\neconomy...\u201d\nnational firms from maintaining their headquarters\nin the UK. Remaining\naligned with the EU\nrulebook is essential for\nexport-dependent compa-nies, such as car makers\nand manufacturing firms.\nAn overhaul of current\nregulations would be associated with extra costs\nsince businesses would\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

These silicone\nreplicas are created using\n3D scanning of the micro-texture of bark, allowing\nmoss and lichen to grow\nin the crevices of bark as\nthey are accustomed to.\nThese replicas have been\nmade porous enough to\nensure that the moss and\nfungi receive sufficient\nmoisture. To replicate\nthe exact conditions that\nmake them so rare, the\nreplica has a more acidic\npH of approximately 6.8.\nTo maximize the light that\nthe lichens receive for\nphotosynthesis, light rays\nare concentrated by specially engineered lenses\nthat have been partially\naffixed onto different\nsections of the replicated\nbark, ensuring a continuous supply of air.\nWoodland Trust's\nwebsite states that 95% of\nash trees are projected to\ndie as a result of a foreign\ndisease called \"ash\ndieback\". The remaining\n5% are expected to be resistant to this disease, but\nthe population of ash trees\nis not expected to return to\ncurrent levels for another\n50 years. In the meantime,\nsmall animals that live\nin ash tree habitats will\nrelocate or die out, with\nthe side effect that moss\nand lichen unique to the\nash tree habitat are not\nlikely to be able to spread\ntheir spores effectively.\nThis would accelerate\ntheir imminent extinction.\nHence, the group is now\nlooking to remodel the\nsilicone replicas into\nwearable habitats. Yishan\nexplained further, stating\nthat human society is very\nactive, making humans a\nvery encouraging substitute while ash tree populations are replenished.\nOther projects covered\ntopics such as using\nseawater rather than fresh\nwater to create durable\nfabrics, thus using a\nless finite resource and\nreducing the usage of\nfresh water which could\ninstead be used for other\npurposes, 'clingy' robots\nwhich seek out humans\nto nuzzle up to and could\nbe kept like pets to reduce\nloneliness or address\nmental health concerns,\nand a device to reduce mi-croplastic pollution from\ntyre wear.\nStudents tackle world problems // Ameena Hassan\n\n"

One of the\nmost popular operas of\nall times, its music has\nappeared countless times\noutside of the opera world,\nincluding in cartoons and\nadverts, so you are sure to\nhear some familiar tunes.\nThis particular production does great justice\nto Bizet\u2019s masterpiece,\nfeaturing eye-catching\nensemble scenes, captivating complex characters,\nand spotless singing all\nthe way through. As a\nself-proclaimed \u201cnational\nopera company for all\u201d,\nEnglish National Opera\n(ENO) translates all their\nproductions into English,\nwhich, albeit unfaithful\nto the original work, improves engagement with\nthe words and the story\nbeing told.\nCarmen is a femme-fa-tale who is deeply aware\nof her seduction powers,\nenjoys using them\nprofusely and entrances\nevery single man on stage.\nJustina Gringyt\u00e9 lives up\nto the role, dominating\nthe stage at all times with\nher fiery acting and clear\nmezzo-soprano register.\nIf a fault must be found,\nshe is a touch too blonde\nfor a gypsy girl. She falls\nin love with Don Jos\u00e9,\na passionate yet jealous\narmy corporal, but later\nleaves him for Escamillo,\na famous bullfighter with\na big ego. The libretto\nexplores the conflicts that\narise, painting a complex\npicture of human relation-ships. All main characters\nare morally compromised\nin some ways and mistreated in others, but\nthat is what makes them\ninteresting and ultimately\nrelatable.\nThis is overall a very\nenjoyable production,\nwith impressive sets and\nunexpected moments.\nOne scene in particular\nmade me admire the cast\u2019s\nability to sing and be\nquite physical at the same\ntime, though my favourite\nmoment has to be the\nfamous aria \u201cL\u2019amour est\nun oiseau rebelle\u201d, mostly\nbecause my high expectations were fulfilled. There\nwere only a couple of less\nfortunate moments. On\none, a premature attempt\nat comic relief was simply\nweird. Then, the stomping\nof army boots muffled\nthe singing of the ladies\u2019\nchorus. But perhaps that\nwas intentional, showing\nhow teasing woman for\nfun is simply annoying\nand not fun at all.\nBizet\u2019s genius or-chestration, capturing\nintense Spanish rhythms,\ntogether with clever\nartistic choices, expand\nand amplify emotions.\nWe leave lost, having\nbeen fully immersed in a\nworld of soldiers on duty,\nchildren playing on the\nstreets, factory woman\nenjoying cigarettes,\ntoreros and their legions\nof fans, and smuggling\ntravellers - then suddenly\nbrought back.\nA Female Faustus: an ambitious twist on a classic\nA\nward-winning\np l a y w r i g h t\nChris Bush\u2019s\nradical retelling\nof the German legends of\nFaust, whose pact with the\ndevil gives his unlimited\nknowledge and worldly\npleasures \u2013 but as always,\nthere is a price to pay. This\nmyth exploring sacrifices,\nlegacy, hubris, and greed\nhas previously been the\nbasis for many literary\nworks (most notably\nChristopher Marlowe\u2019s\nDoctor Faustus, and\nJohann Wolfgang von\nGoethe\u2019s Faust), but none\nhave reinterpreted it in\nthis way \u2013 an inversion\nof gender where the\niconic character of Johann\nbecomes Johanna. This\nallows countless new\nthemes to be explored,\nwhich are perhaps more\nrelevant than those relating to an accomplished but\nbored man who squanders\nthe powers he is granted\nplaying practical jokes.\nIn this play, Faustus is\nreimagined as a young\n17th century woman,\nthe daughter of a plague\ndoctor father and a mother\nwho was tried and killed\nas a witch years ago.\nHere, it feels like she has\nmore of a reason to strike\na deal with Lucifer \u2013 more\nagency and the ability\nto control her destiny.\nHer sex and social class\nchanges the lens of the\nplay, and what she chooses\nto do with her newfound\nabilities. Consequently,\nthis play becomes an\nintriguing study on the\nfemale experience, and\nwhat a woman does with\ngreatness. Bush has taken\na classic male narrative\nand inserted a woman into\nit \u2013 this creates more obstacles and new directions\nfor the story to take.\nThe beginning is\nconfusing as the Faustus\u2019\nbackstory is so different\nfrom the original, but by\nthe end of the first half I\nwas thoroughly enjoying\nthe play - the plot began\nto make sense, there were\ninteresting twists, and the\ncharacters were well-de-veloped. Faustus struck\na deal for 144 years of\nlife with unlimited power\nfrom Lucifer\u2019s servant\nMephistopheles and the\nability to leap forwards in\ntime. However, perhaps\nall these new ideas were\ntoo ambitious, as the\nsecond half feels muddled\nas she traverses further in\ntime particularly as she\nenters the modern age. I\nfeel the message is lost,\nand the aim of exploring\nwomen in history who\nhave broken the social\nconstraints of a male-dom-inated world is not met\nas expertly as in the first\nhalf. More exposition was\nneeded, and though the\nplay was 2 hours long, the\nhalf following the interval\nfelt rushed.\nHowever, I can\noverlook all this as Jodie\nMcNee plays a brilliant\nFaustus, saving the\nsecond half from falling\nflat. Furthermore, I have\nto commend the striking\nset design of Ana In\u00e9s\nJabares-Pita and the\nlighting designer Richard\nHowell, who aptly reflect\nthe tone of the play in the\nenvironment \u2013 first dark\nand cavernous, fluidly\nchanging to reflect the\nlocation and time period\nall the way in to the 21st\ncentury.\nThis Lyric Hammersmith Theatre and\nHeadlong co-production\ndebuts here in West\nLondon before going on a\nnational tour including the\nBirmingham Repertory\nTheatre, Bristol Old Vic,\nLeeds Playhouse, and\nNorthern Stage throughout March and April 2020\n\u2013 so catch it when you\ncan, where you can!\nIt surely won\u2019t last long // Richard Hubert Smith\nISSUE 1742\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

What are they good for?\nThe student Union must remember that it is first and foremost a body that represents the\ninterests of its members\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Editor\nT\nhe history of\ntrade unionism\nin Britain is a\nlong and proud\none. Groups of workers,\nrecognising the strength\nthat their numbers and\nknow-how granted them\nsaw that while individually weak in the face\nof huge organisations,\na withdrawal of labour\nwas a powerful enough\naction to force changes in\nprocedure.\nStudent unionism has\na slightly less illustrious\nhistory but it should never\nbe forgotten that student\nled movements have long\nbeen active and success-ful, fighting the Citizenship Amendment Bill in\nIndia today or helping to\nprevent implementation\nof the regressive poll tax\nin 1990\u2019s Britain. The two\nforms of unionism share\na common purpose of\nrepresenting the interests\nof a group of individuals\nlacking in wealth, time\nand influence, to the\nuniversity, college or\ncompany with which they\nare affiliated.\nIt has been established\nin these pages and by\nmultiple other sources\nin the Union that the\nrent model proposed by\nthe College is not in the\ninterests of the students\nand that the models built\nby the College priori-tise profit over student\nwelfare. The model\nsuggests for example\nthat after 50 years of use\nthe value of the halls\nbuildings will be zero.\nOdd as it is that a building\ncould change from being\nsuitable accommodation\nfor students one night and\nthen suddenly become\ndecrepit the next day, the\nmodel increases payments\ninto a long term maintenance fund by 80%. What\nis the maintenance fund\nbeing used for if not to\nkeep the halls in a good\ncondition? Obviously,\nit is the Union\u2019s job to\nreject this rent model as\nunfair and the fact that the\nCouncil has done so three\ntimes now is a point in\ntheir favour.\nThis is not the end\nof the story, however.\nHaving rejected the College\u2019s position the Union\nshould now lobby the\nCollege as strongly as it\nis able to reduce or even\nprevent rent increases.\nAtop the College\u2019s egregious definition of what\na \u2018break even\u2019 model is,\nthe assumption that the\nCollege should be running\na \u2018break even\u2019 model, in\nwhich the rent from the\nhalls is equal to their cost,\nis an assumption that must\nalso be challenged. This is\nthe role of the Union.\nYet the only Union\nresponse has been a spineless endorsement of a\nhypothetical campaign to\nbe run by a non-Council\naffiliated student. Their\nreasoning for this was\nthat as Council meets\nonly every month any\ncampaign would be tor-turously slow to react to\nchanges in events.\nTherefore, it was felt to\nbe a better idea to allow a\nstudent campaign to run\nand provide support in\nvarious activities such as\nthe production of posters\nand leaflets, as it would\nlook better if the impetus\nfor the campaign came\nfrom students as opposed\nto the Council. For the\nsame reason the Council\ndiscarded ideas such as\nsit ins or demonstrations\nas these would ideally\narise spontaneously from\namongst the student body.\nIn other words, second\nyear and above students\nnot in halls and first year\nstudents without a longitudinal perspective on\nhall prices are supposed\nto mobilise themselves\nspontaneously at which\npoint the Union would\nstep in and help them print\nposters.\nI find this attitude\nparticularly frustrating\ngiven that the Union has\njust created the position of\nhomogeneous halls closer\nto campus will continue.\nNorth Acton will become\na place to dump those that\ncan\u2019t afford anywhere\ncloser in.\nThere is an obvious\nroute that the Union and\nCouncil should take.\nMembers of the Council\nshould remember that\nthey are first and foremost\nstudents who have been\nelected to represent\nstudents. They have been\ngiven the responsibility\nto pay attention to issues\nsuch as rent increases so\nthat students don\u2019t need\nto. A Union led campaign\nshould be started with\nrent strikes or helping\nprospective student find\nprivate accommodation\nrather than enrich the\nCollege as very possible\ncourses of action.\nOn the College side,\nI would ask academics,\nadministrators and\nanyone else with a voice\nto remember their own\nuniversity days. I would\nask them to consider if\nan institution as wealthy\nas the College should be\nemploying underhand\ntricks such as increasing\nthe value of the debt from\nbuilding the halls in line\nwith inflation - a loan is\nfor a fixed amount and\ndue to inflation the real\nterm value of that loan\nwill decrease over time.\nThe student body understands that rents will\ninevitably increase. They\ncame to London knowing\nhow high the cost of living\nis. The last thing they\nexpected, however, was\nthat the College would be\nthe one fleecing them.\nAn entirely unrelated image // Flikr\n\u201cWhy then\ndoes our\nUnion Council\nshy away\nfrom whole\nheartedly\nbacking the\ncampaign to\noppose rent\nincreases?\n\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the\nmaintenance\nfund being\nused for if not\nto keep the\nhalls in good\ncondition?\u201d\nWorking Class liberation\nofficer in order to focus\nmore on issues of access\nthat affect students from\nless well-off families.\nThere will be no spontaneous uprising.

    "content": "An introduction to interview and dining etiquette\nFOOD\nTimon Schenk\nWriter\nH\nave you ever\nbeen invited to\na job interview?\nWell, if you\nhaven\u2019t so far, imagine\nthat you were to attend\nan interview followed by\na lunch. How would you\nsay hello? How would you\nbehave at the table? What\nare the do\u2019s and do nots?\nIn the following, we want\nto introduce you to what\nmany students don\u2019t know\nand what they will learn\nonce they start working:\netiquette in two scenarios.\n1st scenario: a typical job interview\nImagine you are\napplying for your most\nwanted job and you are\nfinally invited to attend a\npersonal interview. How\nexciting! But do you also\nknow how to make a good\nimpression?\nIt all starts with the first\nimpression. No boss likes\nwaiting, so you should\narrive well in advance to\nan interview with your\npotential boss.\nIf you take public transportation to get there, take\na bus or train that arrives\nat least 30 minutes in\nadvance. If you have a car\nor bike, check the parking\nspots and to which facility\nor office you must go.\nKeep in mind that companies can be huge and the\nrespective office could be\nat the opposite end of the\nfacility. For appropriate\nclothing, you can always\ncall the reception to ask\nabout the usual dress\ncode. You should be at\nleast one style level above\nthe company\u2019s usual dress\ncode to show that you\nvalue the company and its\nemployees.\nOnce you\u2019ve managed\nto arrive, register at the\nreception so that your interviewer can be informed\nabout your arrival. Afterwards, the interviewer is\nprobably going to pick\nyou up. He or she will then\nbring you to the interview\narea. This is normally the\ntime for handshakes and\nsmall talk.\nIf you are sitting while\nbeing offered a handshake,\nstand up. Also make sure\nthat your hand is dry even\nif it might be a hot day\nand you are sweating. Additionally, be aware that\nthere is a certain hierarchy\nyou must follow when\nperforming a handshake.\nUsually, the host offers his\nguests the handshake and\nthe more senior person\nreaches for the less senior\nperson\u2019s hand. This means\nthat an older man offers a\nyounger man the hand, a\nlady offers a man of any\nage the hand and an older\nlady offers a younger lady\n\u201cBe aware\nthat there\nis a certain\nhierarchy\nyou must\nfollow when\nperforming a\nhandshake\u201d\n\u201cThere may be\nseveral sets\nof silverware\nbut a general\nrule of thumb\nis to work your\nway from the\noutside in\u201d\nthe hand.\nDon\u2019t try to force a\nhandshake. If several\npeople are offering you\na handshake, take the\nfirst one that is offered\nto you. Never decline a\nhandshake that is offered\nto you, unless you have a\ngood reason, like you are\nsick. A situation where\nyou decline the handshake\nof a gentleman to one to\na lady might make the\ngentleman feel uncomfortable and the lady a\nlittle strange.\nFurthermore, let the\nhandshake be a solid one,\nwhich would not seem like\nyou are being offered a\ndead fish or that you want\nto destroy the extended\nhand. Don\u2019t shake the\nhand longer than five\nseconds. Keep eye contact\nwith the inviting person to\navoid staring at your own\nbeautiful hand. Introduce\nyourself with your name\nand keep in mind that a\nreal professional would\nrepeat the name of the\nperson he is shaking hands\nwith. This is a good way\nof signalling our brain to\nremember the name.\nAfterwards, the interviewer may ask you how\nyou are doing, if it was\neasy to find your way to\nthe building or something\nsimilar. Please be aware\nthat this is the wrong\nmoment to complain about\nany inconveniences you\nhave experienced earlier\nthis day. You should reply\nthat everything went fine\nsince you want to show\nthat you are a person\nwho can handle stressful\nsituations and knows how\nto make a proper small\ntalk. Don\u2019t hesitate to\nask a question in return if\nyou feel the need to, since\nthis demonstrates your\nself-confidence.\nIt is recommended to\nhave a fresh breath. It\u2019s a\nwell-known tip amongst\nexperts to have peppermint candy or chewing\ngum in your pocket, but\ndon\u2019t forget to finish it\nor take it out before you\nmeet your interviewer.\nIf you are offered a\nbeverage, you can decide\nwhether or not you want\nto accept it. There is no\nright or wrong here.\nThe interview itself\nwill not be covered in this\narticle but we recommend\nyou to be confident and\npolite to leave a good\nimpression.\nAfter the interview,\nbe sure to say goodbye\nproperly by looking into\nthe eyes when giving an\nappropriate handshake, as\ndiscussed before.\n2nd scenario: a\ncasual dinner during\nan assessment centre\nNow imagine that the\ninterview went great and\nthat you can consider\nyourself a master of giving\nhandshakes. Instead of\nsending you home, your\npotential boss invites you\nto a lunch in a restaurant\nwith some potential col-leagues. This might sound\namazing for some people,\nbut for others it might be\nquite stressful: what do\nyou do in the case you\ndon\u2019t like the food offered\nor if you are allergic to it?\nIf you are allergic to\nany food, don\u2019t hesitate to\ntell the host or the waiter,\nsince it can endanger your\nhealth. Usually there are\nlots of different dishes\neven at restaurants specialised in something like\nseafood.\nThere are a few things\nthat you need to know\nabout rules at lunch table.\nGood etiquette can be impressive but it should lead\nto a pleasant time where\nyou enjoy food together.\nIt is recommended to\nmute your mobile and\neven better, to not use it in\nthe presence of others as\nit is very impolite. Once\nthe table is set, wait to be\nseated or wait for what\nyour host. If he sits down,\nyou can sit down as well.\nYou should sit up straight,\nbut comfortably. If there\nis a napkin on your plate\nor next to it, you should\nput it on your lap right\naway. You will use this\none napkin to wipe your\nmouth when needed\nduring the meal.\nIn the Western world,\nthere is usually a plate\nand next to it at least one\nfork and knife. Cutlery\nfor desserts is usually\nplaced on the top side of\nyour plate. A soup spoon\nwould be placed on the\nright-hand side. There\nmay be several sets of silverware but a general rule\nof thumb is to work your\nway from the outside in.\nIf you are not sure which\ncutlery to use, just have\na look around you and\nobserve what other people\nare doing. On the top right\nof your plate, there will be\na water glass and a wine\nglass. On the top left you\ncould find a small plate\nwith a small knife, which\nis for bread and butter.\nDuring the meal keep\nyour elbows off the table,\nsince it is considered to be\nimpolite. While you are\nchewing it is good to keep\nyour wrists on the table.\nWhen it comes to spoons,\neverything that is served\nin a bowl or boolean cup\nis supposed to be eaten\nwith one. Be careful that\nthe meal is not too hot to\navoid burning yourself.\nAlso, don\u2019t salt your food\nbefore trying it, since a\nhiring manager may think\nthat you\u2019d rather make\nassumptions than decisions based on fact and\nthis could have a negative\nimpact on their decision. It\nmay also be disrespectful\nfor the chef. Once you\u2019ve\ntried the food and still find\nit to be underseasoned for\nyour taste, you can ask for\nsalt and pepper.\nChew with your mouth\nclosed and avoid making\nunpleasant noises at any\ntime. Furthermore, you\nshould avoid talking\nProper dining etiquette leaves employers with a good impression // Kaboompics\nFOOD\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\n\n"

    "content": "Ways to spaghett your pasta to the next level\nFOOD\nEllie Fung\nFood Editor\nP\nasta ticks all the\nboxes \u2013\u2013 quick,\neasy, cheap \u2013\u2013 but\nspaghetti with\njarred tomato sauce can\nget boring, to say the\nleast, after the twentieth\ntime. So, how can you\nelevate it without dishing\nout an arm and a leg and\nwithout honing in on your\nbusy work/study/procras-tination schedule?\nFirst things first: salt\nyour pasta water! I\u2019m\nsure all good chefs will\nunanimously agree with\nme on this one (I\u2019m not\nclaiming to be one myself,\nI just watch a lot of cheffy\nfood videos on YouTube\nIt adds a ton of flavour to\nreally elevate your final\ndish. Liberal seasoning is\ntypically why restaurant\nfood tends to taste so\nmuch better. Optimally,\nthe cooking water should\nas salty as your ex. The\nsea would do just fine\ntoo. That might seem like\na heart attack-inducing\nquantity, but you\u2019re going\nto be draining most of the\nwater, with most of the\nsalt, anyway. The salted\nwater does double duty:\nyou can also use it to\nblanch vegetables (think\nbroccoli, frozen peas,\nasparagus) for a couple\nminutes before you toss it\n\u201cA sprinkling\nof fresh or\ndried herbs, or\neven balsamic\nvinegar, adds\ndepth of\nflavour\u201d\nwith sauce and pasta.\nIf you\u2019re going to be\ndressing your pasta (I sure\nhope you do) later, cook\nyour pasta until its al dente\n(Italian for \u2018to the tooth\u2019;\naka with a firm bite). Pasta\ncontinues to cook as you\nstir it into warmed sauce\nor if you decide to toss it\nin a saucepan with something else. This way, you\ndon\u2019t end up with mushy\npasta. The timing should\nbe on the packaging, but\nif you\u2019re unsure, don\u2019t go\nabout throwing a strand\nof spaghetti to a wall and\nseeing if it sticks. Taste\nit! Go for something a bit\nfirmer than you\u2019d like, or\nbite and look at the centre.\nIf there\u2019s a small, whitish,\ndry core, it\u2019s al dente! If\nyou like your pasta super\nfirm, cook it a minute orzo\nless than what it would\ntake to reach al dente.\nAfter cooking your\npasta (and maybe veg-etables), reserve some\ncooking water before\ndraining. It contains starch\nreleased by the pasta in\nthe cooking process which\ndoes wonders for emulsifying any sauce you add\nin later. Another thing:\ndon\u2019t rinse your pasta!\nThis only prevents sauce\nfrom clinging onto any\nremainder starch on your\npasta to coat it evenly. We\ndon\u2019t want sauce to be\nsliding all over the place.\nNow that we have beautifully cooked pasta, it\u2019s\ntime for sauce. To spice\nthings up (literally), add\na pinch of paprika, chilli\npowder, red pepper flakes\nor ground black pepper\nwhen you\u2019re reheating\nthat jarred tomato sauce.\nA sprinkling of fresh or\ndried herbs, like basil,\noregano and rosemary, or\neven a drizzle of balsamic\nvinegar,canalsoadddepth\nof flavour that\u2019ll only cost\nyou a mere penne more.\nIf you\u2019re feeling fancy,\nopt for fresh herbs for an\nextra punch.\nIf you have a little extra\ntime, feel free to elevate\nthe tomato sauce with\nextra ingredients. Heat\noil in a saucepan and\nfry some garlic (minced,\nthinly slice or smashed\n\u2013\u2013 it\u2019s down to how lazy\nyou feel) until fragrant.\nTo up the nutritional value\nand taste, add in diced or\nthinly sliced vegetables\n(perhaps blanched in the\nsalted water beforehand),\nmushrooms, ground meat\nand/or chopped bacon or\nsausage and cook until\nnicely browned before\nadding in the sauce and\nperhaps herbs and spices.\nWhat you add depends on\nhow much time you want\nto dedicate to chopping\nand what you have at\nhand. All this sauteeing\nmight seem like a hassle,\nbut it can be done while\nyour pasta is boiling away.\nDon\u2019t just limit yourself\nto tomato sauce though.\nThere is a huge spectrum\nof prepared sauces\navailable on supermarket\nshelves, such as various\npestos and cream-based\nsauces, including plenty\nof plant-based options for\nmy vegan friends. Add\nsome to the same pan with\nthe extra veg and/or meat\nto reheat, then on goes\nthe drained pasta. Here\u2019s\nwhere that reserved pasta\nwater comes in. Treat it\nlike a strong alcoholic\ndrink. Without, the pasta\nand sauce might mingle,\nexchange small talk, but\na little splash of starchy\nwater will really get the\nsparks flying At this point\nyou may want to add in\nsome cheese \u2013 grated\nparmesan is always\nreliable, but try ricotta or\nfeta to enhance the cream-iness. Don\u2019t worry if it all\nlooks a little watery \u2013 the\nsauce will eventually\nthicken to give your pasta\na gorgeous glossy coat.\nIf you\u2019re feeling healthy,\nstir in some tender greens\nuntil wilted \u2013\u2013 spinach,\nrocket, fresh basil or\nparsley are good options.\nOr, ditch the jarred stuff\naltogether and come up\nwith your own sauce in the\nsame time. It might even\ncome out cheaper than if\nyou were to buy premade\nsauce. Heat up some oil\nand/or butter, then add in\ngarlic until fragrant. And\nthen saut\u00e9e whatever you\nlike as described above\nbefore adding in your\npasta and pasta water. Try\nolives or capers for an\numami boost, or lemon\njuice/zest for brightness,\nor heavy cream for cream-iness, or mix and match\ndifferent cheeses to see\nwhich combinations you\nlike. There are endless\npastabilities.\nSince you\u2019ve already\ngone the extra mile\n(without spending too\nmuch extra time), why not\nadd toppings? More grated\ncheese is always nice, but\nchopped nuts, toasted\nseeds and breadcrumbs\nprovide a nice contrasting\ncrunch while fresh tender\nherbs or greens lightens\nup a rich, creamy dish. If\nyou\u2019re feeling adventur-ous, yoghurt can provide a\nbit of welcome tanginess.\nOne more thing: switch\nup the pasta shapes!\nThere\u2019s a reason over 600\ndifferent shapes exist: they\nare optimised for certain\nsauces. Rule of thumb:\nwide noodles = thick,\nheavy, chunky sauce.\nThin noodles = creamy,\nlight, smooth sauce.\nRidges and hollows, as\nin penne or rigatoni, are\nideal for trapping hearty\nsauces and pestos. Shorter\npieces, like fusilli and\nfarfalle, are great for pasta\nsalads (which also take\nminimal time and money)\nYou might find you prefer\nthe texture and sauce-re-taining ability of other\nshapes over what you are\nnormally having now.\nOn hectic days, you\nprobably want to go for\nsomething even quicker.\nInstead of microwaved\nready-meals, opt for\none-pot pastas \u2013 they\nare superior in cost and\nflavour, with a multitude\nof online recipes. All you\ndo is chuck the ingredients (yes, including raw\npasta) into a pot, cover\nand simmer. In under\n20 minutes, you end up\nwith a tasty and filling\nmeal, minus the hassle\nof draining pasta, reheating sauce and washing\nmultiple pans. Plus, you\ncan always make extra\nportions to to cut down\non cooking time on\nupcoming busy days.\nHopefully by now\nyou\u2019ve gathered some\ninspiration for your next\nmeals, or at least some\nvague idea in the back of\nyour mind. No need to\nfollow all these tips reli-giously; simply adopting\na couple can step up your\npasta game. Since you\u2019re\nlikely going to be eating\npasta for the next few\nyears at uni (and probably\nbeyond that as well), you\nmight as well experiment\nand keep things saucy in\nthe kitchen.\nISSUE 1742\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nwhile chewing food.\nSince it might be the case\nthat someone asks you a\nquestion while you have\njust put the next bite into\nyour mouth, signal to\nthe asker that you will\nfinish chewing before you\nanswer.\nOnce you have finished\nwith a course, you should\nput your fork and knife at\na twenty past four clock\nangle to signal that you\nare done.

You might\nwant to improve things or\nhelp other people, volunteer because your friends\nare doing it, perhaps you\njust want to boost your\nCV and learn some new\nskills, or maybe there just\nisn\u2019t anyone else who\ncould do it and you care\ntoo much to leave the spot\nunoccupied and see your\nclub or society fail.\nNo matter what your\nprimary motivation is,\nyou need two key things\nto stay driven for long\norganise free bar nights,\narrange a trip abroad and\nhave great publicity and\nmake all of the money\nalong the way to be able\nto deliver even more next\ntime.

Taking the\nprevious example of\nthe UK and Italy, where\nItaly exports apples to\nthe UK. Let\u2019s say the UK\nuses the imported apples\nto make apple cider and\nsell it to Italy. We can\nlogically assume that the\ncost of the cider is more\nexpensive than the apple.\nTherefore, if the UK uses\nall the apples it imports to\nDoes this mean a trade\nsurplus is always good?\nIn general, it is fair to\nsay that a trade surplus\nis good. However, there\nmight be situations where\nacountry,companiesorin-dividuals might choose to\nrun a deficit. For example,\na country could choose\nto run a trade deficit if it\ndecides to spend millions\nof pounds importing\nenergy due to unforeseen\nenergy consumption, to\nprovide for its citizens.\nAn interesting effect of\na trade surplus\nThe effects of a trade\nsurplus might result in a\ntrade deficit. How does\nthis happen? Let\u2019s take\nthe cider example. The\nUK sells cider to Italy and\nItaly sell apples to the UK.\nEarlier we said that the UK\nhas a trade surplus but we\ndid not take into account\nthe effect of currencies.\nThis surplus might\nincrease the value of the\npound against the euro\nbecause the UK sells its\ngoods in pounds and for\nItaly to purchase ciders it\nwould need to buy pounds.\nAs a result, the demand\nA country could be in surplus and deficit to different countries at the same time! // Carroll D.Wright, 1899\nTrade deals are agreements between two or\nmore countries, usually\nin the form of a treaty,\nunderlying how they can\ntrade with each other.\nThis, however, does not\ntake into account the\nWorld Trade Organisation\n(WTO) trade rules, which\nallows member countries\nto trade with each other on\npredefined rules, without\na trade deal.\nThe lack of a trade deal\nprovides less favourable\ntrading terms for the\ncountries involved. For\nexample, taxes imposed\non goods by another\ncountry which result in\nmore expensive goods\nand thus reducing the\noverall demand for those\nsame goods.\nL\net\u2019s begin with\nsome definitions.\nWhat is Trade?\nIt is the concept\nof buying and selling of\ngoods and services with\ncompensation provided to\nthe seller by the buyer. A\nmore direct explanation\nwould be the exchange\nof goods and services\nbetween parties.\n\u201cThe effects of\na trade surplus\nmight result in\na trade deficit.\nHow does this\nhappen?...\u201d\nPavan Singh Gill\nICIS\nInvestment Student Writer\nWhy is trade important\nand how is it relevant\nto me?\nAt the fundamental\nlevel trade occurs daily,\nFor example when you\npurchased that cup of\ncoffee. You were provided\nwith a service from the\ninteraction and the goods\nis coffee. In return, you\nhandover cash which\nwas the compensation\nyou owe for the goods\nand service. Trade, in this\naspect, is vastly important\nbecause it allows individuals to leverage each\nother, instead of having to\nproduce all of the goods\nand services that she or\nhe consumes. At a global\nlevel, we can talk about\nthe trade between countries using terms such as\nDeficits and Surpluses,\nbut before that, we need\nto introduce the notion of\nexports and imports.\nWhat are exports and\n27\nmake cider and sell all the\ncider it produces to Italy.\nThe monetary value of\nthe goods sold by the UK\nwould be greater than that\nof Italy. Hence the UK\nwould have what is called\na trade surplus. And Italy\nwould have what we call a\ntrade deficit.\nWhat is a deficit?\nA deficit refers to the\nnotion that the monetary\nvalue of the exports of a\ncountry is greater than its\nimports. In layman terms,\nwe can oversimplify this\nconcept and say that the\ncountry behaves like a\nfriend who spends more\nmoney than she/he has.\nfor pounds goes up,\nrelative to the euro. And\nmore pounds would\nflow into the UK, giving\nit better control of its\ncurrency. This, in turn,\nmakes ciders seem more\nexpensive to Italy due to\nthe cost of pounds and\nresults in Italy importing\nfewer ciders from the UK.\nSince the UK sells fewer\nciders, its imports are\n\u201cSurplus - the\nnotion that\nthe monetary\nvalue of the\nimports of\na country is\ngreater than\nits exports\u201d\n\u201cAgreements\nbetween\ntwo or more\ncountries,\nusually in\nthe form of a\ntreaty\u201d\nworth more than its export\nand it experiences a trade\ndeficit.\nTrade deals\nThe discussion on trade\nwould not be complete\nwithout talking about\ntrade deals. What are\nthey?\n\n"
