    "content": "The year of 2020 is probably one of\nthe worst years in history that oil\nexecutives had hoped to find themselves\nin.Justsevenmonthsago,theWestTexas\nIntermediate (WTI) crude has shocked\nthe world with an almost 300% drop in\nindex price, trading at around negative\n$37 per barrel.\nWhat does it mean really?\nWell, in short, you are actually paying the person with the oil to not give\nyou the oil! The reasons behind this\nwere the novel coronavirus that caused\noil demand to halt, and the supply cut\nfrom the Organization of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) that had\nnot scheduled to come into effect weeks\nlater. With Pfizer and BioNTech reporting success of their coronavirus vaccine\ntrial earlier this week, the oil industry\nsupposedly looks brighter ahead. On the\ncontrary,variousentitiessuggestthatthe\nglobal oil demand remains low, and oil\nindustry prospects heading into 2021\nare extremely weak.\nEarlier this week, the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) cautioned that a\nCOVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to come\nto the oil market\u2019s rescue until late 2021\nat the earliest, as the effect of the vaccine\nwill only show towards the end of next\nyear.Oildemandwouldcomelowerthan\ninitially forecasted due to the surge in\nnumber of COVID cases across Europe\nand the US, and social distancing measures governments have implemented to\nhalt the spread of the virus. In the mean-time, global oil supply rose by 200,000\nbarrels/day from 91.2m barrels/day in\nOctober, with production expecting to\nrise further after the US recovers from\nthe Hurricane Zeta, and Libya restoring\nproduction of 1m barrels/day within\nfour weeks after the eight-month block-ade. The macroeconomic contributions\nfrom weaker demand and increasing oil\nsupply will potentially deteriorate oil\nprices further, deeming the December 1\nOPEC meeting in an attempt to curb oil\nproductionandrebalancethemarketfor\nslow progress crucially important.\nBiden administration\u2019s victory in the\nUS presidential election might further\ncomplicate the oil industry, sending off\nmultiple contradictory market signals\nand uncertainties. Under president Biden, if the US and Iran manages to return\nonthepathofdiplomacy,thereischance\nthat strict US sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports could be eased, paving way for\naround 2m barrels/day of oil supply, further weakening oil price. However, some\nof his other proposals such as limiting\nnew drills on federal territory could on\nthe contrary, shave off US oil produc-tion. More importantly, US under Biden\nmight potentially be able to recover oil\ndemand given his commitment to tackle\nCOVID with his COVID-19 task force.\nThe uncertainties in oil price is reflected in the oil futures market. For\nexample, the Brent crude contract for\nDecember 2023\ncan be bought\ntoday at $48\nper barrel, just\nover $3 a barrel\nover the next\nthree years from\nthe current oil\nprice. The December 2025\nBrent crude\ncontract, which\nseems distant\naway from now\nand the COVID fear, is barely just $49 per barrel.\nConsequently, shares from BP and ExxonMobil have both plummeted to below their April 2020 lows, with oil executives struggling to find solutions, be it\ninvesting more in renewables or praying\nfor the oil traders\u2019 sympathy or the so\ncalled \u201coil cycle\u201d that supposedly cannot\nbe broken.\nContrary to the pessimistic oil mar-ket, the gold industry is doing more than\njust fine. Barrick Gold, the world\u2019s second biggest miner recorded a significant\nthreefold rise in adjusted\nthird-quarter profits\non the backdrop of\nthe surging price of\ngold.\nGold prices set a\nnew record nominal high this year of\nmore than $2000 per\ntroy ounce, amid sustained investor de-mandforgold,which\nhas pushed prices up\n26 per cent.\nThe above average\nperformance of gold is understandable\ngiven that gold has always been in the\npast considered a natural hedge against\neconomic recessions and currency vola-tility.\nWell, maybe now might be the right\ntime to move from investing in oil futures to buying gold after all.\nUncertainties in Oil Prices Beyond 2020\nWEAKER DEMAND\nAND INCREASING\nOIL SUPPLY WILL\nPOTENTIALLY\nDETERIORATE OIL\nPRICES FURTHER,\n\u201c\nOil prices are unlikely to recover easily well into 2021, given the weaker demand outlook, coupled\nwith rising oil supply.\nCredits: Worksite Ltd.\nYanda Wong Investment writer\nOil, alongside other products such\nas metals (copper, gold), livestock\nand meat, energy (oil, natural gas),\nand agricultural (grains) are classified as commodities, the basic\ngoods in our daily life.\nCommodities are one of the most\nimportant asset classes for invest-ment. While they are not generally\nsuitable for individual investors,\ncommodities do provide an important way to diversify investment\nportfolio beyond traditional securities for institutional investors,\nsuch as hedge funds and private\nequity funds. There are numerous ways to invest in commodi-ties, including futures, options,\ncontracts, and exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs). Within the oil mar-ket, there are few most common\noil benchmarks, which represent\ncrude oil from different parts of\nthe globe, including: Brent Crude,\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI),\nand Dubai/Oman.\nThe supply and demand of crude\noil, and thus its price have huge implications on the global economy,\naffecting not only the daily lives\nof individuals, but also industries\nranging from aviation, transporta-tion, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, and automobiles.\nI\u2019m too embarassed to ask:\nwhat are commodities?\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nINVESTMENT\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n22\n\n"

I first heard\nabout this award from a friend who was one of the awardees last\nyear. She encouraged me to apply and so I started gathering up my art\npieces to make an online portfolio. I also made new artworks during the\nsummer to prepare for the interview. So before receiving this award, it\nhas already inspired me to create more art. And I believe this award\nwill continue to push me forward while providing me with plentiful resources and support. I\u2019m also excited about the tutorials with\ndifferent artists as I\u2019ve always been curious about other people\u2019s\ncreative process. Although many things have been different due to\nCOVID, it gave me the excuse to finally experiment with digital\ndrawing. During lockdown, I learnt various software such as Procreate, Illustrator and 3D modelling tools such as Blender. And\nI really came to love the versatility and convenience of digital\nart which I will continue to explore in my future work.\nCredits:\nSanthosh G.\nThavarajasingam\nMy name is Santhosh G. Thavarajasingam,\nand I am a 5th year medical student. I\nwas born in Sri Lanka and grew up in Australia and Germany. My art practice started three\nyears ago, when I found some acrylic colours\nin my parents\u2019 cellar during a summer break\nand painted a little something with my two\nbrothers. We loved how painting brought\nus together and enabled us to express our-selves, so we kept painting.\nMy paintings reflect what I have\nbeen, I am, and I am becoming. Some\ninspiration comes from my Hindu\nheritage, from the places I grew up in,\nGerman poetry and aboriginal art.\nThat said, most of my ideas come\nfrom my brothers. I would not be\npainting without them. Furthermore, I would like to thank Mindy\nLee for the Byth Art Awards which allowed me\nto expand my fine art practice alongside my medical studies.\nI got to know about the Blyth Centre Awards through the Imperial\nArt Society. The award allows me to practice art with less financial constraints and it\nextremely motivates me to continue creating art.

    "content": "\u00c0bout de souffle (\u2018Breathless\u2019)\ncame as something of an\ninevitable explosion in the world\nof French cinema. Before the\nrelease of Breathless in 1960, and\nof other nouvelle vague pictures\nsuch as Truffaut\u2019s The 400 Blows\nor Resnais\u2019s Hiroshima mon\namour in 1959, there had been\na growing dissatisfaction among\nFrench critics and directors. In\nthe French film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, critics like\nAndr\u00e9 Bazin, as well as Truffaut and Godard, cemented a\nnew theory of filmmaking called La politique des auteurs,\nor, as English speakers know it today, \u2018auteur theory\u2019. The\nNew Wave wanted films to be imprinted with the mark of\ntheir maker, to express emotions and ideas in the same way\nthat a novelist creates with their pen\u2014so-called cam\u00e9ra-stylo. There was admiration from these French critics for\nthe non-conformist streaks in Renoir and Vigo. Beyond\nFrance, they established an admiration for American\nauteurs like Welles and Hitchcock in many ways before the\nAmericans did. Breathless was one of the ground-breaking\noutcomes from those decades of discontent\u2014\u201cWe barged\ninto the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis\nXV\u201d, as Godard put it.\nBreathless is loose and fluid; it is full of tracking shots and\nquite jarring jump cuts\u2014most of which are there because\nGodard removed parts and didn\u2019t feel it necessary to patch\nup the remains. The New Wave was not a movement,\nTruffaut said, it was \u201ca quality\u201d. If the movie comes off as\nimpromptu, that\u2019s because it is; as Richard Balducci said:\n\u201cShooting ranged from 15 minutes to 12 hours, depending\non how many ideas Godard had that day\u201d.\nWhile I have no time for the modern Godard movies like\nLe Livre d\u2019image or Film Socialisme\u2014which mask their lack\nof vision with flourishes and needless abstractions\u2014Breathless is different. Although it is not a film I deeply cherish, it\nwould be disingenuous of me to downplay its authenticity\nand its impact on cinema. 60 years on, modern directors\nhave still not squeezed Breathless of all its nourishment, its\ntechnique, or its flair. [If you can find it, there\u2019s a new 4K\nrestoration out now to celebrate its anniversary.]\nClassic Film of the Week\nDavid Fincher: Top 5 Films\nEditor Recommends\nIn anticipation of Fincher\u2019s new film Mank, out on 4th\nDecember, I\u2019ve compiled the top 5 movies from his illustrious career thus far:\nI can\u2019t think of a more fitting\nend to the twentieth century\nthan a crazed man referred to\nonly as \u2018The Narrator\u2019 telling an equally crazed woman:\n\u201cTrust me, everything is going to be fine... You met me at\na very strange time in my life\u201d,\nas \u2018Where is My Mind?\u2019 by The\nPixies plays in the background, and skyscrapers holding\nimportant records are blown up in a hopeless attempt to\nerase debt.\nWith God slain and chucked to the roadside, politicians seen as corrupt and incompetent, and inequities\nnumbed with rampant consumerism, the \u2018everyman\u2019 of\nthe twentieth century (played by Edward Norton) has\n\u201cnothing to overcome, nothing to explore\u201d as Fincher\nsaid. He is forced to create an \u00fcbermensch, called Tyler\nDurden (Brad Pitt), to create his values. The result is\nbrutal, rebellious, hate-filled, explosive, relieving, and\ndesperate. It is David Fincher\u2019s magnum opus.\nIn what is Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s best ever performance, David Fincher\u2014helped by a clinical, fast-paced script by\nAaron Sorkin, and some sublime editing by Angus Wall\nand Kirk Baxter (who both won\nan Oscar for their work)\u2014creates\nwhat could prove to be a modern\nclassic. The wit of the dialogue,\nthe smoothness of the picture,\nand the slowly-building drama\nthat barely announces its pres-ence, could maybe be overlooked\nupon first viewing. However, as\nrewatches reveal, this film is beautifully economical in its\nplot, and exquisitely sharp in its presentation. It is hard\nto concisely describe its efficacy, although the word \u2018unified\u2019 captures most of it. Every single element, from the\ncentral performance to the Oscar-winning soundtrack,\nfeeds into the cold and cynical atmosphere that so often\nfesters in the ranks of prestigious institutions, and in the\nminds of those too rational for their own good.\nA clumsily-titled crime thriller about two detectives chasing a\nkiller whose crimes take inspiration from the seven deadly sins.\nThe colour palette for this film\nbears a striking resemblance to\nthe sludge one sees on the banks\nof the River Thames: it is dark,\nsqualid, feculent, and, well...mesmerizingly disgusting.\nThe more we look, the more we are repulsed. Every plea\nwe make to watch from a distance is denied. Our only\noptions are to either turn the movie off, or to embrace\nthe heinous brutality and pray that whatever was in that\nThamesian sludge does not cause lasting damage.\nNick Dunne searches for his\nwife Amy after she disappears one\nmorning. As the film progresses,\nwe discover that Amy may not\nbe as disentangled from her own\ndisappearance as we previously\nthought.\nThe first act is an exquisite,\nslow burn which tonally feels somewhat similar to Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2013 film Prisoners. However, this film is\nnot at 3 because of its frankly fanciful resolution.

    "content": "Public finance funds fossil fuels\nThe UK government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions so that by 2050 the country\nproduces net-zero emissions. A limited number of steps have been taken\nover the last few years to support a just\ntransition to a net-zero economy. Next\nmonth, the Sixth Carbon Budget is\nto be published by the UK\u2019s Climate\nChange Committee, which is expected\nto advise to the government on how\nwe may get to net-zero greenhouse gas\nemissions in the UK. Here are some\nactions that will likely be in the plan:\n\u00a7 Energysupply:Quadrupleamount\nof energy production by renewable\nsources, such as wind and solar powera\n\u00a7 Business : Move towards a circular\neconomy, bring in carbon taxes and start\na reskill/retrain programme for green\njobs\n\u00a7 Residential : End the use of gas,\nand convert boilers to be able to use\nhydrogen or electric power, design and\nretrofit homes to be energy efficient,\nclimate-resilient, re-design neighbour-hoodstoprovideallnecessarygoodsand\nservices, decentralisation of work zones,\n\u00a7 Transportation : Ban the sale of\npetrol and diesel cars by 2035, reduce\nthe number of flights, stop subsidies for\ncompanies intensively using oil and gas\nwithout commitment to transitioning\nto renewables, funding for research and\ninnovation for electric aeroplanes, more\nelectric vehicle charging points, invest\nin electric battery recycling, promote\nactive travel such as walking and cycling\n\u00a7 Food system : Reduce consumption of beef, lamb and dairy, promote\nmore plant-based diets, reducing food\nand packaging waste at industrial, commercial and residential levels\n\u00a7 Landscape : Nature recovery by\nconverting current farmland into for-est, planting 1.5 billion trees across the\ncountry, peatland restoration, green in-frastructure, more flood defences\n\u00a7 Systems : A sustainable and resilient food system, healthy models of\nwork which allow remote working and\nlower carbon behaviours\nAccording to figures from the UK\ngovernment, the carbon dioxide\nemissions produced from 1990 to 2018\ndeclined by 43.5%, which it thought\nprincipally to be due to the shift away\nfrom coal as an energy source. To ensure that emissions continue to move in\na downward trend, in 2008 the Climate\nChange Act was enshrined in UK law,\ncommitting the country to reduce all\ngreenhouse gases emissions by 80% (rel-ative to 1990 levels). This Act was then\nupdated in 2019 to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100% by\n2050. These commitments may seem\nthat everything is on track for reducing\nemissions in the UK, however, in 2019\na report from the UK Climate Change\nCommittee stated that the UK\u2019s policy\nactions fell \u2018well-short of those required\nfor the net-zero target\u2019.\nOne of the pledges that the UK has\nmade, as part of the coalition of G20\ncountries, is to\nend \u2018inefficient\u2019 fossil\nfuel subsidies.\nA recent report from the\nOverseas Development Institute, a UK\nbased think\ntank, tracks\nthe progress of\nG20 countries\nin phasing out\ngovernment\nsupport and\npublic money\ncommitments\nto fossil fuel production and consumption to increase transparency and ac-countability. Along with every other\nG20 country, the UK is at risk of not\nachieving the pledge of phasing out fossil fuel subsidy commitments. Strangely,\nthe UK government denies that it provides any fossil fuel subsidies, under its\ndefinition of the concept. Yet, between\n2014-2018 the amount of public money going to the fossil fuel industry in-creased. The report found that the UK\nand Russia provide the highest levels of\ndirect transfers and tax exemptions (per\nunit of GDP) of all G20 countries. The\nUK was also ranked as one of\nthe highest in showing significant support to fossil fuel use\n(per unit of GDP).\nThe global energy policy\ntracker found that since the\nbeginning of the pandemic until the 11th of November, the\nUK government has given \u00a330\nbillion to support oil and gas\nfossil fuel industries, which is\napproximately \u00a3446 per cap-ita. Some of these funds went\nto projects such as the oil and\ngas energy sector in Scotland\nor national road-building pro-grammes, and other funds\nwent to bailing out huge companies such as Honda, Nissan, Baker\nHughes (oil industry company) and\nSchlumberger (oilfield services provid-er). The government also committed\n\u00a312.16 billion to clean energy (renew-ables), 40,5% of the money put into oil\nand gas industries and \u00a3182 per capita.\nLooking at our COVID\nresponse on a broader\nscale, compared to 30\nmajor economy other countries, the UK\nranked in 2nd place\n(the USA in 1st!) in\nfossil fuel fund commitment during the\npandemic.\nThe UK\u2019s Climate\nChange Committee\nrecommends that the\ngovernment uses this\nmoment of crisis to create a just transition and\na green recovery from\nCOVID-19 to define the fight against\nclimate change.\nGreen Party MP\nCaroline Lucas also\nhighlights the importance of a green\nrecovery: \u2018This really\nis a once-in-a-gener-ation opportunity to\nus on the path to a\ngreener, fairer future.\nGoing back to business as usual would\nbe a one-way street\nto climate disaster.\u2019 This will involve removing oil and gas subsidies away from\nthe budget and redirecting money into\nprotecting the most vulnerable affected by subsidy removal and into support\nhealthcare and social support. It is vital\nto ensure that poor and vulnerable consumers can still access and afford energy\nas subsidies are reduced.\nIn the UK, 78% of current emissions\nareproducedbytransportation,business\n(commercial use), energy supply (burn-ing fossil fuels) and residential heating.\nTo reach net-zero by 2050 the UK government needs to put into place much\nmore action on the pledges and policy\npromised and needs to stop providing\nsupport for coal exploration and transportation with a quicker shift to renewable energy sources. We will see how the\ngovernment plans to manage the situation in the new carbon budget, which\nwill supposedly be presented by June\n2021.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nHow might UK\nachieve net-zero?\nThe G20 countries (shown) have pledged to reduce fossil fuel subsidies\nfrom public money.

In a recent commentary published in the Lancet, a leading\nmedical journal, CEOs of major health\ncharities warn of the threat to UK medical research and development, likely\ncausing delays to medical advances and\ndeployment of next generation treatments for patients.\nDue to the pandemic, funding for\nresearch by charities has fallen precipi-tously. Many fundraising events like the\nLondon Marathon have been cancelled,\nwhile charity shops remained closed for\nextended periods of time. This has led to\na 38% drop in fundraising income between March and May 2020 and a projection of a fall in research spending by\nup to \u00a3368 million for 2020/21.\nAs the financial impact starts to bite,\ncharities have already taken drastic actions in anticipation of further losses.\nTheBritishHeartFoundationhashalved\nits budget for this year, down from \u00a3100\nmillion. Meanwhile, Cancer Research\nUK has cut \u00a344 million from its budget,\nas well as postponing all decisions on\nnew research ideas for 6 months - meaning that no new research projects\nwere approved or\nfunded in the first\nhalf of 2020.\nWhen the\ngovernment announced a \u00a3750\nmillion package\nto support charities back in April,\nmedical research\nwas excluded. Instead, money was reserved for front-line\nservices to patients, leading to calls for\nmore funding to keep research and development going.\nThe effect of a lack of funding will\nbe keenly felt by patients and scientists\nalike, as charities play a crucial role in\nsupporting medical research in the UK.\nIn 2019 alone, their fundraising efforts\nbrought in an estimated \u00a31.9 billion,\nwhich represented just over half of the\ntotal investment in publicly funded\nmedical research in the UK. They also\nsupport over 17,000 scientists and their\nwork to advance our understanding of\ndiseases and search for\ncures.\nMoreover, chari-ty-funded research\nhas led to numerous breakthroughs\nover the years, such\nas the development\nof radiotherapy for\ncancer treatments\nand life-saving medications for heart\nattacks and strokes.\nThese treatments have aided in the prevention of an estimated 830,000 cancer\ndeaths in the UK since the 1980s.\nWith funding not expected to recover for at least 3 to 5 years, charities have\nalso warned of the long-term risks, such\nas delays in bringing new treatments for\npatients. Furthermore, there are signs\nthat researchers are also feeling the pres-sure. In a recent survey, 40% of scientists\nfunded by charities expressed a desire to\nleave the field as a result of the recent\ncuts.\nHowever, it does seem that the government is aware of the impact. In their\nlatest UK Research and Development\nRoadmap policy paper, published in July\n2020, the government noted that the\npandemic has \u201cexposed the fragility of\nthe funding system, with large sections\nof our national research activity dependent on third-party funding sources, including international student fees\u201d. They\nhave also vowed to \u201cstabilise the system\u201d\ninthenextspendingreview,whichisdue\nto be published later this month.\nAs a result, charity bosses have called\nfor the government to use the review as\nan opportunity to bridge the gap. They\npropose setting up a new life sciences\ncharity partnership fund, which will enable improvement in patient outcomes\nand help protect careers. With spending and financing policies being debated\nnow more frequently than ever, perhaps\nthere is hope that the ever-important\nmedical research can continue.\nA conversation with Tom Whipple, Science\nEditor of The Times\nLast Friday, Imperial students were\nlucky enough to have a conversation\nwith Tom Whipple, Science Editor of\nTheTimes,duringanonlineeventorganised by Felix.\nSpeaking to aspiring journalist stu-dents, Tom recounted how he first got\ninto journalism an interest alongside\nhis Mathematics degree. For this work\nhe was named the Guardian Student\nFeature Writer of the Year. From there,\nTom\u2019s began his career as a freelancer, resulting in a job at The Times, where eventually he became Science Editor.\nInthisrole,Tomhaswrittenaboutavariety of topics: from the bizarre concept\nknown as the leap second which causes\nhavoc on Wall Street to the people who\nrefuse to leave the Chernobyl exclusion\nzone. His job has also allowed him to\ntravel, taking him across the world to\nchase the latest science stories.\nInterested in journalism yourself? During the interview, Tom offered 3 tips to\nwriting a good science story:\n1. Interview the scientists. Getting the\nhuman voice into your story is potentially much more interesting than the\ncanned quotes that the press release of-fers. Ask why the author of the paper is\ninterested in the finding, and how the\nscience was done.\n2. Read the paper. Press releases are a\ngreat resource for finding the story, but\ndelving into the paper and getting to\ngrips with the science yourself is a much\nmore thorough source of information.\n3. Science is received better as a feature\n- not hard news. Try and go deeper within your story than the classic headline,\nbreakthrough, pyramid structure. Humanise and write a richer, more detailed\npiece.\nA good science journalist is also a responsible one. Science stories appear\nsimilar across most outlets because they\nare constructed by objective journalists\ntrying to get the science right. Unlike\nsome aspects of journalism, science stories tend to be the least subject to editorial pressures. If you are concerned\nabout accuracy, it is acceptable to send\na paragraph to the scientist to sign off\non technical accuracy \u2013 but no need for\ncopy approval. And if you find yourself\nwriting in complex jargon, it is probably\na sign you do not understand the science\nfully; go back and research more so that\nyou can explain it in layman terms.\nFor those who aspire to be a science\njournalist like Tom, in his opinion, the\ncommonality in journalism is those who\npersevered \u2013 it isn\u2019t an easy field to break\ninto, but persistence is key to getting to\nwhere you want to be. Take up all the\nopportunities you can \u2013 graduate trainee schemes or getting your name on a\nfew national by-lines (or even writing for\nyour student newspaper *cough cough*)\nis a good place to start.\nPatrick Chan Science Writer\nAlana Cullen Science Writer\nIN 2019, CHARITY\nFUNDRAISING\nBROUGHT IN AN\nESTIMATED 1.9\nBILLION POUNDS\n\u201c\n\n"

This time, the\nvaccine is being developed by Moderna Inc., a US-based biotech firm, and\nthe efficacy from the study of 33,000\npeople was shown to be over 94%.\nModerna\u2019s vaccine is designed using\nthe same concept as Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s\nvaccine, i.e.. mRNA that drives the individual\u2019s cells to produce antigens and\ngenerate an immune response (read\nabout it in last week\u2019s issue if you haven\u2019t already!) and requires two doses.\nSimilarly to last week, the results have\nnot yet been peer-reviewed, however\nthey still allow for cautious optimism.\nIt must also be noted that while 94.5%\nand 90% seem like different numbers,\nthe vaccines they represent are likely to\nhave the same, or even reversed, efficacy.\nAs Imperial\u2019s coronavirus vaccine lead\nProf. Robin Shattock tweeted: \u201c[We\nhave] no idea what the efficacy will be\nat 6-12m.

Unlike last week\u2019s vaccine\ncandidate, which the EU and UK have\nboth signed large deals for (200m and\n40m, respectively), Moderna\u2019s largest\ndeals thus far have been with the US for\n100m doses (and an option for 400m\nmore), Japan, Canada and Switzerland,\nwith the EU commission only having a\n\u2018potential purchase agreement\u2019 (that is, nothing set\nin stone). The UK, mean-while,scrambledtosecure\na mere 5m doses on Monday when the news of\nefficacy was announced.\nModerna\u2019s vaccine is\nalso the most expensive\nof the frontrunners,\ncosting around \u00a340 for\nthe two required shots,\nin comparison to Pfizer\u2019s \u00a330, or Oxford/\nAstraZeneca\u2019s \u00a33.\nNevertheless, as\nthe mood around the\nworld improves, it will still be\nmonths before the vaccines will have\nan effect on day-to-day life \u2013 so it is up\nto governments and individuals to act\nresponsibly to control the spread of the\npandemic until they are widely available.\nModerna reveals 94.5% efficacy for\nits coronavirus vaccine\nShortly after midnight UTC\non Monday 16th November,\nthe first operational crewed mission from American soil successfully launched and subsequently docked\nwith the International Space Station.\nOn board the Crew Dragon spacecraft were NASA astronauts Commander Michael Hopkins, Victor\nGlover, Shannon Walker and JAXA\n(Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Soichi Nogushi.

    "content": "Art is an interesting aspect of life.\nWhile we consume it every day,\nwe fail to articulate and define its remit.\nAnd even the boundaries, if any, between the ill-defined definitions we\nprovide for say Arts, Music, and Theatre\nare ever so blurred in the 21st century.\nIn another world, in a world without\nCOVID-19, a busy world that is, we\nwouldn\u2019t have had time for such seman-tics. But in this current expanse of time,\ncourtesy of the pandemic, the mind\nwanders for such introspection.\nLondon is truly blessed in that\naccord. A modern-day bridge between\nthe old world and the new one, both literally and metaphorically. Tucked away\nin its quaint neighbourhoods, museums\nin London offer a quick getaway to any\npart of world, from full blown headliners such as The National Gallery or\nBritish Museum to the quaint personnel\ncollections of\nfamous Britons\nsuch as The Wallace Collection or\nApsley House.\nConsidering\nthat, I realized\nthat I was better\nplaced now, in\ndiverse London,\nthan in my earlier\nyears, to address\nthis predicament\nWhat is the\ndefinition of Art?\nIf not a compre-hensive, articulate\none, at least a personal one would\ndo for now. For\nthe better part\nof 2020 while\nthe COVID-19\nsituation ravaged\nall over, the absence of prolonged local\nlockdown meant that you could almost\nmake up for the lack of international\ntravel and enjoy these exhibits like\nnever before, away from the crowds, the\nglistening frenzy of Instagrammers and\nthe constant chatter of tourists. However, as England is dragged into a second\nlockdown this opportunity is alas taken\naway.\nPushing for a last rendezvous and\nseeking to resolve my dilemma before\nthe curtains close, I find myself here\non the 4th of November, a cold grey\nLondon evening in Manchester Square,\nstanding before the old townhouse\nof the Seymour family, now housing\nThe Wallace Collection. If I am being\nhonest, I chose this one, half indulging\nin an incoherent intuition that if I were\nto find any definition/resolution, it was\nto be in an old school collection such as\nthis, and - well - because they were the\nonly one who had a last-minute ticket\navailable the day before the lockdown.\nSeems like I was not the only Art enthusiast in town, but perhaps certainly was\nthe laziest.\nOne-way paths, reduced occupan-cies for each room, hand sanitiser tills\nevery few yards, and\nthe works. Nothing changed and yet\neverything did. A\nlittle less than half the\ncollection had been\nboarded up, owing to\nsafety measures, but\nenough indeed for its\nquarters. I wandered\nby all the famous stops,\nconsciously reflecting\nthis time on the cause\nof any appreciation.\nThe grand staircase\nwith its famous\nwrought iron balus-trade, made originally\nfor the Royal Bank in\nParis in the early 18th\ncentury, stood as ever,\noverlooking the entrance \u2014 It certainly\nhad allure. But was it\nthe history, or its inherent beauty or was\nit a realisation that it\u2019s a perfect the embodiment of the turbulence of time? I\nwas not sure. But I stood and I watched.\nI followed the trail there on, gazing\nand ogling at the umpteen drawers and\ncabinets from Louis XV\u2019s court, the\nintricate clock pieces with their marble\nsculptures, and the paintings by Old\nMasters, reflecting another time. The\nVenice Canal, busy with activity, painted by Canaletto in his trademark style\n- I wonder if dolphins swam in the canal\nin his time? The Laughing Cavalier\nby Frans Hals was still smiling nearby,\ndespite the dearth of tourists wanting a\nselfie with him now. Anyway, a pensive\nfew moments accorded and I moved\nonto the European armour collection,\nthe least interesting to me personally\nbut it struck a realisation. Most of the\nappreciation stemmed from the exhibits\nhistory, albeit as short as it was. Perhaps\nthat\u2019s the point of these institutions isn\u2019t\nit? The contextualization of the creation\nof Art? I strayed a bit further, moving\nback and forth, savouring all I could,\naware of the lockdown, but I could\nnever put my finger on what constituted\nArt.\nComing out, however, the last thing\nthat registered in my mind, was that the\ndefinition I was seeking was and is by\nitself meaningless. In hindsight, I might\nhave done myself a disservice by visiting\na collection with a narrow gambit, but\nthen again, whatever we call it - Art\ndoesn\u2019t itself articulate, or at least good\nArt doesn\u2019t, but it begs articulation and\ndiscourse. So, at the end of the day, it is\nwhat you make of it. The common consensus however must be that it evokes a\nthirst, a desire if any to be awed, and in\nmy opinion anything that satisfies that,\nwould be the bounds of its definition. It\nseems to be the same across platforms,\nwhether you are in the stands in an op-era, or before a Bernini or in a humble\ndrawing room of a 19th century town-house, looking at Rembrandt.\nI sat outside following this line of\nthought a bit, watching the staff close\nthe gates. The relevance of semantics\ndisappeared further, and a stark reality\nemerged as I watched this somber pa-rade. The reality of the lockdown and\ntheneededshiftinconsumptionof \u2018Arts\u2019\nfor the next few weeks. I was reminded of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s verse\nfrom the \u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019\n- \u2018Water, water, everywhere, and all the\nboards did shrink; Water, water, every-where, nor any drop to drink\u2019. In that\nmoment this captured my thoughts perfectly well. There stood on the other side\nof me, some of the greatest collection of\nArteveraccumulated,availabletoalluntil just a few minutes ago.\nThe internet is indeed a cruel thing,\ntantalisinguswiththeprospectofreplac-ing this physical experience ever since.\nMemories of the hours spent scouring\nthe scores of online museum catalogues\nduring the first lockdown came to mind.\nPerhaps it\u2019s time we all give the internet\nanother try, but when that fails, we shall\nfind ourselves here again when the curtains and the doors reopen, only at that\ntime, there isn\u2019t going to be enough water for our thirst.\nPour away the ocean and sweep up\nthe wood Credits: Imgur/Mathew Photoman\nVaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nThe Wallace Collection\nONE-WAY\nPATHS,\nREDUCED\nOCCUPANCIES\nFOR EACH\nROOM, HAND\nSANITISER\nTILLS EVERY\nFEW YARDS,\nAND THE\nWORKS.\n\u201c\nCredits: Cleo Zhang\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nARTS\n\n"

    "content": "Climate change deniers: we all know\none. They are randomly interspersed amongst our friends and family.\nSo, this holiday season prepare yourself\nby getting your facts straight. We know\nhow frustrating it can be and how uncomfortable it is when your great-un-cle is divulging endlessly that climate\nchange is a controversy or a scam. So, on\nthat note, here\u2019s what to say when\u2026\nThey say: \u2018Climate change is just part of\nthe natural cycle\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Yes, the earth\u2019s climate has always changed. However, in the last 150\nyears, we have recorded exceptional\nchanges in climate and modelling shows\nthat the temperature is likely to continue to increase. Plus, the warm temperatures of the Medieval Warming period\nwere only in some parts of the Northern\nhemisphere, not the whole earth which\nis happening now.\u2019\nThey say: \u2018There is no evidence that we\nare causing catastrophic climate change\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018There is a clear consensus from\nthousands of scientists across over 100\ncountries that we are causing climate\nchange which will affect the lives of almost everyone on the planet.\u2019\nThey say: \u2018Carbon dioxide is a gift of life,\nnot a pollutant\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Yes, carbon dioxide is an essential compound for life on earth, and the\ngreenhouseeffectkeepsusalive,butwith\nthe quantities that have been emitted an-thropogenically the earth is warming\nThey say: \u2018Sunspots are causing warmer\ntemperatures.\u2019\nYou say: \u2018Since 1978 there has been no\nupward trend in the amount of the sun\u2019s\nenergy hitting Earth.\u2019\nThey say: \u2018The Climate Cult is ready to\ndeclare on the developed world, especially the USA\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Oh dear\u2026\u2019 The level of learning and unlearning needed is too high.\nLeave the conversation; you don\u2019t need\nthis today.\nThey say: \u2018Climate change is good for us\nas it will make farming more productive\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Perhaps in the Global North\nthere will be higher agricultural pro-ductivity; however, this benefit is likely\nto be offset by the losses in the Global\nSouth, as warming temperatures cause\nmore frequent weather events and desertification.\u2019\nThey say: \u2018We have other problems to\nsolve; first, this isn\u2019t a priority\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Firstly, countries in the Global\nNorth, such as the UK, have a responsibility to act now to reduce emissions\nand the impact of climate change as\nthey have contributed to the most of\nemissions throughout history. Secondly,\nmany climate solutions will benefit us\ndirectly, like reducing air pollution, creating jobs, and improving food security.\u2019\nWhen they say: \u2018The Climate Cult is\nready to declare on the developed world,\nespecially the USA\u2019.\nYou say: \u2018Oh dear\u2026\u2019 The level of learning and unlearning needed is too high.\nLeave the conversation; you don\u2019t need\nthis today.\nMicroplastics in our plants?\nArecent paper published in Nature\nsustainability studied the potential uptake of microplastic by plants. We\nall know that microplastics are present\neverywhere around us \u2013 in the rain fall,\nthe soil, the oceans and the fish we eat.\nThere\u2019s even a term for this widespread\nphenomenon \u2013 the \u2018plastic cycle\u2019, just\nlike the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle.\nBut could plastic pieces also be found inside our salad leaves?\nWell, it turns out that the possibility is there. Li and her team found that\nmicroplastic beads below a micrometre\n(0.2 \u03bcm) and even larger beads of 2 \u03bcm,\ncould enter the roots of wheat and salad\nleavesspecies.Thisoccursatthejunction\nwhere new lateral roots begin to form\nbecause, during this process, there is a\nsmall, vulnerable gap between plant cells\nwhere external organisms such as parasites (and now plastic) can enter. After\ngaining access inside, the tiny beads will\nmove throughout the rest of the plant.\nBut as with many scientific studies,\nthere\u2019s a caveat \u2013 the study was only conducted on two species of plants, so we\ncan\u2019tbecertainthatthisisthecase.More\nimportantly, the roots were isolated in a\nhydroponic culture \u2013 far different to\nthe natural conditions in the soil where\nother the presence of microbes, fungi,\nsymbionts and nutrients could yield different results.\nThe takeaway from this study, though,\nis not the specifics of which species under which conditions might be vulnera-ble. These are things that will hopefully\nbe explored in future studies. For now,\nit\u2019s about understanding the dangers\nand potentials of microplastic invad-ing, quite literally, every square inch of\nlife on earth. If the idea of eating foods\ncontaining fragments of plastic doesn\u2019t\nset off alarms in societies that something\nmust change, I\u2019m not sure what will.\nResponding to climate deniers\nMonami Miyamoto Sustainability Editor\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nJustlastweekinEindhoven,agroup\nof Dutch students managed to build\nthe first electronic vehicle out of waste\nmaterials.

    "content": "Imperial student by day, writer by night.\nWhat made you want to start writing?\nWhen I would read books and watch films, I would\nalways ask questions and come up with ideas on how I\ncould change the story \u2013 e.g. What if so-and-so event\nwent differently? What if there was a new character\nwho took the plot in a different direction? What happened before this story started? What will happen after it ends? At some point, I decided to put these ideas\non paper and I ended up writing a bunch of fanfiction.\nOne which I wrote based on Lord of the Rings is now\n80,000 words and counting \u2013 I was really obsessed\nlmao. After a while, I tried to write my own contemporary stories, but they weren\u2019t very good. I realized\nmy strength was in writing fantasy, so I decided to\nstick with that for the long run.\nWhat kind of research do you do, and how\nlong do you spend researching before beginning a book?\nIt depends on the genre, but for historical\nfantasy you have to do a lot of research\nabout the time period and the society you\nare writing about. You don\u2019t have to research everything before you start writing,\nbut it\u2019s good to look at a map, look at the\nmain cultures, and possibly the structure\nof the society (e.g. monarchy, democracy,\noligarchy, etc.). If you\u2019re doing a completely\noriginal setting, then you need to spend time\nbuilding the world before you write.\nWikipedia is probably the best resource for information about history, and is the first one I looked at\nwhen researching for The Serpent\u2019s Veil (TSV) \u2013 the\nnovel I\u2019m currently writing. I spent about a week\nresearching and compiling information before actually putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard lol).\nIt\u2019s good to write everything down \u2013 I use Evernote\nto keep track of my research. Sometimes you get lost\nin a rabbit hole with research though \u2013 once I found\nmyself knee deep in some obscure article about Saudi\nArabian agriculture because one of the characters\nwas eating a fruit and I wanted to make sure it was a\nfruit you could find in that region at precise time. It\u2019s\nimportant not to let research override the actual writ-ing, and usually readers don\u2019t take notice of such tiny\ndetails (which is sad).\nWhat inspired the book, where do you get constant\ninspiration to make sure the quality is sustained?\nThe source of my idea for TSV was from a book called\nThe Wrath and the Dawn, a (young adult) YA fantasy\nby Ren\u00e9e Ahdieh. It retells the story of Scheherezade\nand Shahryar (the story is more commonly known\nas 1001 Arabian Nights). I did some research about\nScheherezade, and found out that her character was\nbased on a real Queen named Al-Khayzuran. Originally, I was going to write a story similar to 1001 Arabian Nights, but the history surrounding Al-Khayzuran intrigued me and I decided to write a book that\ntold her story with some semblance of accuracy (and\nof course a little magic thrown in because\nwhy not).\nI get constant inspiration mainly\nby reading other books in my genre \u2013 so mainly YA/\nhistorical/high fantasy. When you read successfully\npublished books you get an idea about what sells, and\nalso how to improve your writing. I don\u2019t mean by\ncopying other authors\u2019 technique but more by understanding what constitutes good dialogue, sentence\nstructure, plot pacing, character arcs etc. Reading also\ngives me new ideas for plot points.\nWhat sort of books do you read?\nI read a bit of everything, but mostly fantasy and\ncontemporary novels. I like anything that has an\nadventure or quest type plot, and plenty of swords.\nRomance is nice to have, but not necessary. Right now\nI\u2019m reading The Witcher: Blood of Elves, by Andrzej\nSapkowski, and I am loving it immensely.\nI also make a point to read famous novels in different languages translated to English. You get a lot of\ninsight into the culture (literary and general) of other\ncountries when you read their most renowned books.\nOne author in particular whose work I always read\nand enjoy is Han Kang, who won the Booker Prize\nfor her novel The Vegetarian. I even managed to get\nthrough the colossus that is Anna Karenina, only to\nlearn that Russian literature isn\u2019t really my cup of tea.\nWhen you see your book attracting more and more\nattention, how do you feel?\nI feel really happy and validated when people leave\ncomments on my work, either praising it, or trying to\npredict what\u2019s going to happen. At the same time,\nwhen I receive criticism (especially about cultural/\nhistorical aspects), I know what to avoid and\nwhat to include instead, which is really helpful.\nIn that sense, I do cater to my readers, but I\ndon\u2019t feel any pressure to change the plot or\nanything extreme like that; it\u2019s more about\ncultural sensitivities and making sure I don\u2019t\noffend anyone.\nTips for an imperial writer?\nI\u2019m pretty bad at following my own advice, but\nI would say schedule a regular time and duration to write (e.g. Thursday 6pm for 45 min-utes). You shouldn\u2019t write when you \u2018have time\u2019,\nbut rather make the time for it like it\u2019s a lecture or\na tutorial that you have to attend. This kind of takes\nthe fun out of it, but if you want to make significant\nprogress and you\u2019re really passionate, it\u2019s the best way.\nWriter\u2019s block is a real issue for me (once I didn\u2019t write\nfor 6 whole months), and sometimes the only solution\nis to force yourself to spit something out, even if its\ncomplete shit. If something is there, at least it can be\nedited! Also consider joining the Writers Society \u2013\nthey have really useful weekly workshops and write\nins.\nWhere can we find your work and describe The Serpent\u2019s Veil for those who haven\u2019t read it.\nThe Serpent\u2019s Veil is set in the Arabian Peninsula during the 8th century, and follows the story of Khayzuran, whose world is turned upside down when she\u2019s\nkidnapped and sold to a travelling caravan belonging\nto the Caliph (\u2018King\u2019). The story is filled with decep-tion, royalty, intrigue, and war, catering heavily to fans\nof The Wrath and The Dawn, Prince of Persia, and\nAladdin.

They found\nthat countries which operate an energy mix that is partially nuclear and\npartially renewable are less efficient,\nas the nuclear and renewables \u201ccrowd\neach other out\u201d, resulting in the high\nlevels of national investment required\nfor successful renewable programmes\nbeing misdirected towards nuclear.\nIt is clear, then, that a 100% renewable\nenergy mix is the ideal approach to elec-tricitysupplyintheUK.ButtheUKcur-rentlyusesanaverageof1873TWhofen-ergyperyear,andtoproducethisamount\nrequires significant land area, as well as\ninvestment. For example, consultancy\nfirm LucidCatalyst calculated that using\nsolar power to replace oil demand alone\nwould require around 23,000 square\nkilometres of land \u2013 roughly 10% of UK\nland area. Wind, geothermal and tidal\nenergy all require similarly large areas.\nThere are two solutions to this prob-lem. One is to increase the efficiency of\nrenewable energy sources, and the other\nis to find ways of storing energy so that it\nis not wasted (e.g. so that solar energy is\nstored on sunny days, when there is more\nthan we need). Both of these solutions\narefocusesofworldwideenergyresearch.\nHowever, research does take time. If\ntheUKGovernmentdirectedalltheirin-vestment in nuclear towards renewables\ntomorrow, we would still be left without\nenergy for potentially years, as we waited\nfor the research to bring more efficient\nor storable renewable energy. Given that\nwe have got a very short amount of time\nto turn climate change around, we really\nneed an alternative to fossil fuels that we\ncan use right now. Using nuclear power\nprovides an intermediary stage on our\nwaytocompletedecarbonisation\u2013astepping stone \u2013 and it is therefore necessary.\nThat being said, nuclear should not\nbe the long-term future of energy in this\ncountry. We should be seeing a gradual phasing out of nuclear energy in the\nnext few decades, and a rapid growth in\nrenewable investment. The UK government has awarded billions of pounds to\nseveral new nuclear initiatives in recent\nyears, and I cannot help thinking that at\nleast some of this would have been better spent elsewhere. Renewables may not\nbe able to provide us with all the energy we need today, but our government\nshould be investing much more heavily\nin research so that the UK energy sector can decarbonise as soon as possible.\nCONTINUED\nFelix\u2019s tips for Black Friday tech shopping\nBlack Friday originated in the US,\nwith the day following Thanksgiving signifying the start of the Christmas\nshopping season. Despite the fact that\ntheUKdoesnotcelebrateThanksgiving,\nthe event has crept onto our shopping\ncalendar, with American companies such\nas Amazon and Asda (then owned by\nWalmart) introducing the event in the\nearly 2010s, and major British retailers\nfollowing in 2014 for fear of missing out.\nAlthough many firms had misgivings -with John Lewis\u2019 CEO calling Black Friday\u201cbadforbusiness\u201din2015-theevent\nhas clearly been a success for retailers.\nShoppers in the UK spent an estimated \u00a38.29 billion over the Black Friday\nweekend in 2018 \u2013 an average of \u00a3346\nper person. This year\u2019s Black Friday event\nwill undoubtedly be different to what\nhas come before; an economic downturn\ncaused by the coronavirus pandemic, the\nsecond lockdown and severe shortages of\npopular products such as games consoles\nand laptops threatening to dampen the\nretailer\u2019s takings. With that in mind, it is\nmore important than ever to make sure\nyou get the best out of your spending.\nScrolling through pages and pages of deals is a great way to make sure\nyour wallet ends up lighter than you\nintended. The deals page on websites\nare the digital equivalent of window\nshopping, without the physical limitations the real-life version presents,\nmaking it easy for you to convince yourself you need something you do not.\nBefore the deals start, make a list of\nthings you actually want. It is best to\nnot be too specific when doing this \u2013\nwhile a TV is almost definitely going\nto be on sale, a specific model may not\nbe, and limiting your choices to a single\nproduct might lead to disappointment.\nWhile we associate pressure selling\nwith the dodgy man in the van on Rogue\nTraders, the subtle tricks digital retailers\nuse are no less effective. A great example\nof this is Amazon\u2019s \u201cLightning Deals\u201d,\nwith their countdown showing that the\nnumber of discounted items is limited,\nand the timer forcing you to hand over\nyour money in the next 15 minutes or\nlose out on the deal altogether. What\nthis means is that you often do not get\nthe opportunity to compare prices across\nthe market, or even against the retailer\nitself. It is important to not let yourself\nget caught by the tactics of the retailers\n\u2013 take your time researching the product\nand find out if it can be found cheaper\nelsewhere. The short-term deals offered\nare often not that impressive, which can\nbe seen if you use a price tracker such as\ncamelcamelcamel \u2013 sometimes a deal\nis only returning a product to its original price before it had been increased\nto make the deal look more impressive.\nRetailers sometimes have manufacturers bid to build special products to\nfit in a price budget. These products are\nthen given model numbers that are extremely similar to existing products. Not\nonly does this make it more difficult to\ncompare retailers, as they are technically\nselling different models, it makes it easy\nfor you to inadvertently purchase an inferior product. While the products will\nstill keep their headline features, smaller\nthings \u2013 such as the number of HDMI\nportsonaTV\u2013mighthavebeencutinthe\nprocess of making the product cheaper.\nThe obvious rules apply here \u2013 if a\nprice is too good to be true, it probably\nis. Companies that offer a price significantly cheaper than their competitors\nare often shipping from a warehouse\noutside the UK, marking your parcel as\na \u201cgift\u201d and hoping it is not inspected\nduring transit, thereby reducing costs\nby avoiding VAT. Even if it does get past\ncustoms, the items from these sellers are\noften not covered by the manufacturer\u2019s\nwarranty, leaving you at the mercy of the\nseller. Another thing to remember is that\nextended warranties are only as good as\nthe companies offering them \u2013 a 10 year\nwarranty is no good if the company you\nbuy from goes bankrupt in a month.\nIf you are making a purchase of over\n\u00a3100 (and below \u00a330,000) you should\nalsopayforaportionofit\u2013howeversmall\n\u2013 using a credit card.

He chose to write a slow Baroque\n(early 17th century) dance, called the\nPavane. In a change from last week,\nthis is very still and serene, opening with a solo for what is (in\nmy biased opinion) the best\ninstrument of the orchestra-the French Horn. Characteristic of impressionism, this\nshort work develops just two\nthemes, but it\u2019s the harmonies\nthat make it very interesting,\nand the music really builds\nand swells to some chords that\ncan only be described as delicious.\nIt\u2019s best to opt for shorter recordings\nhere- there\u2019s a (wrong) tendency to play\nthis very slow, which ends up making a\nmasterpiece into a bore. Ravel wouldn\u2019t\nhave been happy with this, describing\nslower performances as \u201cDead Pavane\nfor a Princess\u201d. But if the tempo is right,\nit\u2019s really a magical\nfive minutes, incredibly sad music\ntinged with hope.\nBenjamin BrittenSerenade for Tenor, Horn\nand Strings\nSticking with this week\u2019s last-minute\nand tenuous theme of French Horns,\nthis minor work by a very famous late\nKohnfused About Classical?\nEach week Michael Kohn introduces us to one old and one new classical\ncomposition, attempting to break down barriers and make the genre more\naccessible.\nDisagree with me completely?\nIs there a specific theme you want me to recommend classical music\nfor?\nOr do you have music for me?\nEmail me at michael.kohn18@imperial.ac.uk\n20th Century British composer\nis really something. Written for Britten\u2019s lover Peter Pears, and undoubtedly the greatest French horn player of\nall time, Dennis Brain, this work sets 7\npoems by great names such as Alfred,\nlord Tennyson and John Keats to\nmusic that spotlights both the singer\nand the horn, often with the singer\nhaving the melody that is responded\nto by the horn. There\u2019s a deeply serious\nand gut-wrenching Elegy based on\n\u201cthe Sick Rose\u201d by William Blake, or\na slightly more playful Hymn based\non a poem by Ben Jonson, both about\n3 minutes long. The best recording is\nof the original dedicatees Brain and\nPears.\nThree years of production produced\nthis master work from the band Amen\nDunes. Drawing influences from Tom\nPetty, early Oasis and Late Nirvana,\nthe band reinvigorate and restore their\nusual lo-fi dark style. Freedom is a pop\nrock record for those who prefer to be\nunderstated.\nAt first listen the album is solid but\nnot outstanding. Repeated listening is\nthe only way to truly appreciate the subtle genius at work. This is an album that\nreally rewards you for taking a second\nto pay attention, getting you caught on\nits hooks and sucked into its pulsing\nforward momentum. Picture yourself\ndriving down a dusty road in a convertible with a chilled milkshake and fries.\nLyrical focuses is on moments from\nlead singer McMahon\u2019s childhood.\nUsing either real or fictional characters,\nMcMahon explores topics such as his\nfather, masculinity, and his mother.\nRanging from silky to raspy, clear cut to\nriddled with vibrato, McMahon\u2019s vocal\nperformance is endearingly tender;\nexactly like that of a man returning to\ndays gone by.\nFreedom is likely to be off the beaten\npath for most Imperial listeners, but I\nemploy you to give it a chance. I believe\nit to be a perfectly gentle ray of summer\nsun that can break up the increasingly\ndark dismal winter days.\nFelix Recommends\nFreedom\nArtist: Amen Dunes\nForfansof:Oasis, Mazzy Star\nRuntime: 47 mins\nGuthrie Ruby Music Editor\nGREEN\nArtist: Hiroshi Yoshimura\nForfansof: 2 8 1 4, Khotin\nRuntime: 43 mins\nGuthrie Ruby Music Editor\nWay back in the 1980\u2019s Japanese\nartists were pioneering their own style\nof ambient electronic music inspired by\nsounds in nature. Artists like Hiroshi\nYoshimura made it their goal to create music that could fill buildings the\nway natural sounds fill a forest, river or\ndesert \u2013 music that is ever present, never\noverpowering, but still pleasing to the\nhuman ear.\nAs a genre, Japanese ambient environmental music is very distinct. Tracks\nmove at a snail\u2019s pace. Usually, only one\nor two repeated motifs are present with\noccasional variation. There is never any\ncrowding of sounds, it sounds the way\na breath of fresh air feels. In many ways\nit sounds very spiritual, the perfect\nsoundtrack to meditation or yoga.\nGREEN is one of the all-time masterpieces of Japanese ambient environmental music. Using a small range of\nsynthesisers, Yoshimura delicately places\nnotes into space. It has the same calming\neffect as white noise but is loaded with\nartistic expression and is filled with\nheart-wrenchingly ingenious moments.\nIt wasn\u2019t until last year that the genre\nwas paid much attention. An archivist\nteam called \u201cLight in the Attic\u201d compiled tracks from the 80\u2019s into an album\nthat received widespread acclaim. Sadly\nYoshimura died in 2003, but two of his\nalbums were rereleased last year, allowing his music to spread across the world.\n\n"

Prime Minister\nBorisJohnsonisexpectedtoannounceat\nleast \u00a3200m for the project as part of a\nlarger green plan for economic recovery.\nThe UK currently gets around 20%\nof its electricity from seven nuclear sites,\nall of which are owned by EDF Energy. However, six of these seven sites are\ndue to go offline by 2030. EDF are constructing two new reactors at Hinkley\nPoint C, and are\nexpected to be given the green light\nfor two further reactors at Sizewell C\nsoon. But there will\nstill be a reduction in the nuclear energy supply without further action.\nRolls-Royce and their partners claim\nthat the use of SMRs will significantly\nreduce the cost of construction. Each\nnuclear plant would be built from a set\nof \u201cmodules\u201d made in factories and then\ntransported to the site for assembly,\nturning nuclear power plant construction into something like life-size Lego.\nThey also argue that\nthis will increase\nsafety, as making lots of smaller\nmodules will mean\nthat there is greater opportunity to practice construction and learn from mistakes.\nLike most new nuclear projects, UK\nSMR are facing criticism, with environmental groups such as Greenpeace\nquestioning why this investment is not\nbeing directed towards renewable en-ergy, which would not pose the same\nrisks associated with radioactive mate-rials. Others are sceptical about whether the short time scale for construction\nand low cost are actually achievable.\nThat being said, the project is projected to create thousands of jobs\nover several decades, and while nuclear energy is certainly not perfect,\nit has a much lower carbon footprint\nthan the fossil fuels that make up\nthe majority of the UK energy mix.\nRolls-Royce announces plans for 16\nmini nuclear plants\n20%\nof UK electricity\nfrom seven\nnuclear sites\nPicture credits: Shutterstock\nLily Shepherd Science Editor\nAre the UK Government right to be\ninvesting in new nuclear?\nAs the UK government continues to pump millions of pounds into the development of new nuclear facilities, Science Editor Lily\nShepherd discusses whether this is really the right approach for the UK energy mix.\nIn 2018, I spent three months working\nfor EDF Energy, who own the UK\u2019s\nseven nuclear sites. I started with a fairly limited knowledge of nuclear power,\nonly familiar with the introductory theory of nuclear and atomic physics (from\nmy degree) and the negative portrayals\nof nuclear power in the media (from\nthe Simpsons). After months calculating\nthe incredibly low radiation doses that\nwould result from incredibly unlikely reactor faults, I came out of that job with\na strong sense that nuclear in the UK\nis both safe and necessary. But should\nit be the future of energy in the UK?\nEnvironmental groups have long been\ncritical of nuclear power in this country.\nGreenpeace UK describe it as \u201cexpensive, hazardous and slow to build\u201d, and\nargue that it creates problems for future\ngenerations who have to deal with disposal of radioactive waste. They have\nalso suggested that it creates significant\nnational security issues, particularly with\nthe risk of terror attacks on nuclear facil-ities. These are all very valid arguments.\nIt is unsurprising that we are fearful of\nnuclear energy. Most of us have seen the\ndisturbing impacts of the nuclear power\nstation accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima. However, those of us who have\nseen HBO\u2019s stunning drama Chernobyl\nwill know that this accident was prevent-able, and the same has been said about\nthe Fukushima tragedy. In both cases,\nexperts have said that the tragic deaths\nresulting from the accidents could have\nbeen prevented if the governments responsible had followed international\nbest practices and standards. The UK\nnuclear industry is independently regulated by the ONR (Office for Nuclear\nRegulation) and has some of the strictest\nnuclear safety regulations in the world.\nDespite this, it is difficult to make an\nargument that nuclear energy is entirely\nsafe and secure. However tiny, there is\nalways some risk involved \u2013 particularly\nwhen external safety issues such as nuclear terrorism are factored in. Renewable\nenergy sources such as wind and solar\ndo not create the same level of security issues and are more climate friendly.\nA recent study in Nature Energy from\nthe University of Sussex analysed nuclear programmes in 123 countries over\n25 years, and found that countries with\nlarge scale nuclear programmes do not\nLily Shepherd Science Editor\nA nuclear power station.\n\n"

In the race to get into the\n1% before robots replace us,\nstarting a business is a tried\nand tested strategy.\nWe visited the Hangman\nheadquarters, located in a\nlake resort on the Moon, to\nget some tips for young entre-preneurs. The natural place to\nstart is with those whose job it\nis to give this sort of advice, so\nwe consulted the Hangman management consultants,\nmost of whom told us to hire more management con-sultants. Hangman executives following this strategy\nwere weary when the fifth new division of management\nconsultants were still giving the same counsel, but the\nconsultants explained that you can\u2019t make money without spending money and the best way to do that is to\n\u201chire more management consultants\u201d.\nManagement consultants: \u201cHire more consultants\u201d\nCredits: wikimedia\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFelix@ic.ac.uk\n8\nHANGMAN\nLike any good naval ship, the Hangman headquarters has a bridge, and under that bridge live some trolls.\nOnetroll,HrangnirtheUgly,explainedsomethingshe\nlearnt working for the Dark Mage\nof the East: \u201cYou really need to ask\nyourself three questions: when\u2019s\na good time to start planning fi-nances, what\u2019s the optimal financial goal, and\nhow should I go\nabout my financial plan? Then\nyou\u2019ll need to\nstart thinking\nabout growth\nand protecting your investments.\nHow involved with them should\nyou be? Is it better to be flexible or\nstable?\u201d\nAnother troll, one Chase W.\nPhillips, had this to say about busi-ness: \u201cThere\u2019s no point even thinking about it because\nall the minorities are just taking the jobs. My dad man-Hangman Consultancy HQ\naged to get me a job interview with the head research\nengineer at the company he owns and I lost it to this\nother guy just because he was in a wheelchair. My dad\ntold me it was because the guy had 4 PhDs and a Masters but I think we all know what\u2019s really going on.\nThese multimillion dollar companies are getting more\nMarxist by the day.\u201d\nHangman\u2019s writers also contributed: Trevor Saytrevor told us \u201csurroubdn\nytourselkf with smart peopyle\u201d, Erin Onthesideofcaution told us \u201cnever jeeo\ntoue eggs in one basker\u201d, and\nSharin Iskarin told us \u201cexoasnd your pirtvolio\u201d.

He opined that \u201cgoing into this, many people\nthought that being forced to spend days on end locked\nin would provoke students to rebel, but no!\u201d He went\non to express that such docility \u201chonestly left [him]\nwith very little to do\u201d.\nThe behaviour is especially surprising given the usual fanfare around the freshers\u2019 experience, but clearly\nstudents have found their own\nintrospective ways to deal with\nthis.\nSpeaking to some of the residents we found that, while a\nmajority felt inconvenienced\nby the consequences of a global pandemic, all invariably felt\nthat such grievances paled in\ncomparison to their \u201cresponsibility as citizens, classmates, and\nfriends\u201d.

    "content": "FRIDAY 20TH NOVEMBER 2020\n25\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nLockdown advice: recovery\nThis week\u2019s article we wanted to try\ncovering something slightly dif-ferent: rest, stretching, and active re-covery. For anyone doing sport, we\u2019ve\nalways been taught practice make per-fect, and pushing yourself to the limit is\nwhat will make sure you get better. Recently, it\u2019s been found that rest and recovery days are just as important as the\nexercise days; they allow your muscles\nto regrow, it helps prevent injury, and\nhelp your body not go into fatigue. Of\ncourse, the amount of rest and recovery\nis dependent on each person individual-ly, however, since everyone does require\nit at some point, we thought we might\nprovide some ideas to help. If you can, it\nis a very good idea to measure your heart\nrate first thing in the morning every day,\nor every few days, and that way keep a\ntrack of your resting heart rate. If, while\nyou are in a phase of heavy exercise, your\nresting heart rate increases by five to ten\nbeats per minute than this is a very good\nsign that you are either getting ill or over\nfatigued and that you should take some\ntime out to recover. If you have a smart\nwatch that can measure heart rates,\nthen this will make this resting heart\nrate tracking extremely easy. We\ndo understand\npeople take\nrecovery dif-ferently: some\nenjoy stretching\nand meditat-ing, while other\npeople enjoy\nmoving around\nm o re / d o ing\nlighter exercis-es; both of these\nforms are good and just as important\nand beneficial. One of the easiest things\nto do that can encompass both is walk-ing. You can walk as quickly or slowly as\nyou want, listen to good music, and enjoy some of the lovely views of the city\n(wherever in the world you are!). It\u2019s a\ngreat way to let off some energy (even\nthough it sometimes may be frustrating as you aren\u2019t moving as quickly as\nyou wish), but it puts low stress on your\njoints, and you can go very far without feeling too fatigued but still feeling accomplished. The\nweather outside hasn\u2019t\ngotten too cold yet\n(but that doesn\u2019t mean\nit\u2019s always pleasant to\nwalk around) and all\nof the parks are just going through autumn,\nso all the colours are\nstunning. One of the\ndownsides to COVID\nhas been the fact that\nlife has moved indoors\nand online, which does\nmake it much harder to get outside both\ndue to fear of the virus and also due to\nthe extra motivation needed to go outside purely for the purpose of exercise.\nYoga is a great activity to do that can\nbe both a very high intense exercise or\na really good stretching and meditation\nsession.Ifyou\u2019veneverdoneyogabefore,\nthere are so many websites and videos\non YouTube that are really helpful and\neasy to follow along! One of the main\ntips I learned when stretching is taking really deep breaths. For any stretch\nyou\u2019re working on, once you\u2019ve hit your\nlimit of how far you\u2019re stretching, take\na deep, full body breath in, and as you\nbreathe out push your body further to\nstretch more. It always surprised me how\nmuch further I could go. Do make sure\nhowever that you don\u2019t overstretch and\naccidentally pull something. As always,\nremember to listen to your body, if it is\ntelling you rest than that is exactly what\nyou should be doing to get the best re-sults!\nAmanda Barden Sport Editor\n1 2 3 4 5\n6\n7 8\n9\n10\n11 12 13\n14 15 16\n17 18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nFelix cryptic Crossword No. 8\nAcross Down\n1 Muddied circlet hides variable\nwheeled machine\n6 Clever rodent goes to sleep at dawn\n7 Melt solid ponds\n9 Girlfriend finally bares buttocks on\nromantic getaway\n10 After 5 I am in the middle of copu-lating?\n11 Smallest part of a machine running\nbackwards?\n14 Second highest loss of time in total\n16 King follows day before eternity\n17 Appeal to jumping insect.

In the spring and sum-mer, when I was revising for exams ,\nbeing stuck at home was helpful. It\nallowed me to work harder without\ndistraction. I was living alone with\nmy girlfriend and I would get up\nin the morning, exercise and work\nthrough the day and then we would\ncook together in the evening. Yet our\nsituation at the times seemed so much\nbleaker. We had no idea when our\nconfinement would end and far less of\na reason to feel optimistic about the\nfuture as we can now thanks BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna.\nI wonder if this is because the end\nseems both so near and so far away.\nWith full immunisation predicted to\nstill be over 6 months away am I just\nfacing the realisation that many of my\npeers have already been clever enough\nto figure out a while ago. Namely, that\nthings you want to do are no longer\npossible and this situation is still long\nfrom finishing.\nAlternatively it could be that the\nfrustration stems from no longer\nfeeling that the social distancing requirements no longer seem to match\nthe severity of the problem that the\ncountry is facing.\nNeither of these two reasons particularly sits right in my head though.\nI am forced to consider whether the\nreason that I was more productive in\nthe March to July period was because\nI was being kicked out of bed every\nmorning and being told to go and\nmake a cup of tea.\nWhat I need is some sort of machine\nthat can replicate this function. Some\nkind of machine that would only turn\noff when the liquid volume of one\nmug is poured into it and would reactivate if I got back into bed. Please\nsend suggestions to felix@ic.ac.uk\nwith detailed blueprints or completed\nmachines to the Union.\nIsabelle Zhang Deputy\neditor\nMaeve Johnston Newswriter\nNick Manrique Newswriter\nAndrew Melville\nComment\neditor\nSung Soo Moon\nComment\neditor\nEamon Farhat\nComment\neditor\nKhama Gunder\nComment\neditor\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nScience\neditor\nJulia Dabrowska\nScience\neditor\nSudarshan\nSreeram\nTecheditor\nOzbil Dumenci Artseditor\nAmanda\nHertzberg\nArtseditor\nVaidhiswaran\nRamesh\nHeadofArts\nJia Qi Tan\nHeadof\nBooks\nHari Kumarakuruparan\nBookseditor\nMiles Gulliford Musiceditor\nMartin Flerin Musiceditor\nGuthrie Ruby\nHeadof\nMusic\nAsad Raja Musiceditor\nMaeve\nHutchinson\nHeadof\nPuzzles\nMatt Wright Puzzleseditor\nZahra Abiola Foodeditor\nAhmad Danesh Gameseditor\nMonami\nMiamoto\nSustainability\neditor\nFlora Dickie\nHeadofSustainability\nOliver Weir FilmEditor\nKonrad\nHoendorff\nSportseditor\nAmanda Barden Sportseditor\nEnny Tran Copyeditor\nKavan Clark\nHeadof\nCopy\nJeremy Cohen Copyeditor\nThe immense joy of seeing\nsomeone you sort of know\nThe Felix Editor on\nFRIDAY 20TH NOVEMBER 2020\nEDITORIAL\n7\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nWe here at Felix believe that it is always in the interests of the students to\nknow. That cover-up and paternalistic\nobfuscation is never right and that\nas intelligent people students should\nbe treated with respect and given the\nability to make up their own minds.\nTherefore, I, the Felix Editor, on behalf of the team promise that:\nWe will to the best of our ability tell you the whole truth and\nnothing but the truth.\nWe will keep your confidence\nand will only publish something\nyou say to us if you have explicitly\nsaid that we can.\nWe will work to expose unfairness and discrimination in all\nforms that it takes both at the\nCollege and elsewhere.\nWe will treat fairly any article\nsent to us, regardless of point\nof view and do our best to work\nwith you to prepare it for publication it in our pages.\nSignedbyCalumDrysdale\nEditor-inChief\nMaybe some sort of pulley\ndevice?\nI went onto campus this\nweek in order to do\nsomething in the Felix\noffice. My plan was\na quick in and out\nvisit. Arrive, do what\nneeded to be be done\nand leave. What I never\nappreciated is how many\npeople whose acquaintance\nI had made that I would see.\nI am an outgoing person. I like to\nmeet people and talk to them. Yet I\ndo not think I am alone in saying that\nthere are a huge number of people\nthat I know that with whom I have\nnever spoken. Maybe they are on\nmy course or I know them through\nsomeone else. In any case my instinct\nwould once have been to ignore them\nor to nod politely and to\nwalk on by. However,\nthis time, as I walked\nthrough South Kensington I felt like all\nmy filters had been\nswitched off. I was\nspeaking to everyone.\nAnyone whose name I\nknew I greeted with huge\nexcitement delighted at the opportunity to see anyone.\nI wonder what will happen when we\ncan all move around freely again. I\nlike to imagine that other people will\nexperience, the same feeling, at least\nfor a while. A whole country experiencing immense joy at just seeing\nand talking to someone will be lovely,\nhowever, quickly it is over.\n\n"
