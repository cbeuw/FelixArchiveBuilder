Promoted\nby artists such as William\nMorris and the writer\nWalter Crane, it came\nas a reaction against the\nmass production of luxury\nitems such as jewellery,\nand from a desire to return\nto the artisanal craft of\nbeautiful objects. The\nArts and Crafts movement\nwould influence the young\nRen\u00e9 Lalique (1860-1945)\nduring the two years he\nspent in London at the\nSydenham School of Art\nin 1878.\nThe lazy routine of\nmanufacturers who did\nnot renew their models\nand put their firms into the\nhands of their workers had\nturned them into nothing\nmore than honest traders\nand prudent suppliers,\nand threatened to compromise the future of an\nart form whose reason to\nbe seemed only to satisfy\npublic demand.\nLalique initiated the\nradical transformation\nwhich profoundly altered\nmodern jewellery in its\nessential condition and in\nits aspect, by tearing down\nservile practices of imitating ancient styles and\nbreaking the established\nhierarchies which despot-ically graduated materials\ninto their proper uses.\nHe used semi-precious\nstones held in disdain\nby his contemporaries,\nwho remained prejudiced\nby the value of their\nmaterials. Opal, ivory,\njade, malachite, as well\nas materials such as glass,\nleather, enamel, nacre and\nhorn were raised to the\nrank of precious rubies,\nemeralds or diamonds.\nThe spontaneous\nmanifestation of his\npersonal style and its\nquiet contempt of dogma\nincited astonishment,\ndefiance and hostility\nwhen it was exhibited at\nthe Paris World Fair of\n1895. However, by the\nParis World Fair of 1900,\nhis principles had been\nadopted and imitated by\nmany others, cementing\nthem into a new definite\nstyle, the Art Nouveau.\nMoving in the artistic\nand intellectual circles\nof Paris society life, he\nsurrounded himself with\nhigh society ladies who\ndemanded ever-more extraordinary designs, and\nbecame involved in their\nsentimental lives. They\nincluded the soprano\nEmma Calv\u00e9, poet Ren\u00e9e\nVivien, courtesan Liane\nde Pougy, and American\nplaywright, poet and\nnovelist Natalie Clifford\nBarney. Above all, it was\nhis association with the\ngreat Sarah Bernhardt,\nwho wore his designs both\nin the street and on stage,\nwhich helped to establish\nhis reputation.\nNatalie Clifford Barney\ndiscovered the jewellery\nof Ren\u00e9 Lalique during\nfirst jewellers to revive\nthe use of the female nude\nduring the 19th century \u2013\nhe introduced new aspects\nof femininity, of sinuous\nform, expressive character and tragic accents,\nin composite forms as\nsphinxes or mermaids, or\nwith ardent and passionate\nprofiles underneath their\nflowing hair.\nHis jewellery exalts\nand fauna of his garden in\nhis Rambouillet property\nwhich he acquired in 1898\nand which provided inexhaustible inspiration.\nAs a child growing up\nin the countryside town\nof Ay in the Champagne\nregion of France, his\nnatural talent for observation and drawing was\nstimulated during Sunday\nforest walks with his\ngrandfather. He would\nmake sketches from of\nflowers and insects and\nembellish them back at\nhome. As a jeweller he\nwould look back towards\nthe fantastic bestiary\nof his childhood and\nbe inspired, borrowing\nthe elegant, undulating\nlines from the curves of\nbending flower stems,\nstamens and pistils in his\nwork. Dragonflies became\npendants, women with\nbutterfly wings figured on\nbrooches, brambles and\nthistles became hair and\ncorsage ornaments.

It is this\ninterpretation which, to\nthis day, retains the power\nto captivate the imagination when peered through\na glass case and enables\nhis jewellery to exist as\nan independent work of\nart, long after the wearer\nwhose beauty it was\ndesigned to embellish.\nLalique had a gift for combining the natural and the fantastical // Wikimedia\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020\n16\nFASHION felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cLalique\u2019s\ncreations\nconquered\na place in\njewellery-making equal\nto that of an\nartist or a\npoet\u201d\nher affair with Liane de\nPougy.

Trump\nused several different\nofficial channels to try\nto convince or threaten\nBritish officials to drop\ntheir plan of opening the\ndoors to Huawei. Unlike\nAmerican counterparts,\nUK security agencies\nhave long been cautiously\noptimistic about Huawei\u2019s\ninvolvement in the UK\u2019s\ncommunication backbone.\nGCHQ, the British\nsignals and communications monitoring agency\nhas audited Huawei\u2019s\nproducts over the last\nseveral years. Reading\ntheir published annual\nreport from 2019, one\nwould think that Huawei\nis simultaneously Supervillain number one\nwho epitomises the art\nof covert surveillance\nand utterly incompetent\nwithout the competency\nto hide any backdoor at\nall. The report lambasted\nHuawei\u2019s code quality and\nquestioned their \u201cbasic\nengineering competence\u201d.\nIn a single version of\nHuawei\u2019s firmware, the\nauditors discovered 70\nduplicate copies of 4\ndifferent versions of the\nsame dependency library\ncritical for cryptographic\noperations, OpenSSL,\nwith the oldest one originally written 20 years\nago. In any case, GCHQ\nprovided \u201climited assurance\u201d that Huawei does\nHuawei\u2019s 5G network\ndevices aren\u2019t capable of\nsnooping on the content\nof private communications over the internet.\nIronically, all three past\nHome Secretaries have\nexpressed a desire to ban\nend-to-end encryption\nbecause it \u201cprotects\nterrorists\u201d \u2013 displaying a\nshocking lack of cyberse-curity knowledge.\nSo, it\u2019s all well and\ngood and we can all\nenjoy the world\u2019s most\nadvanced 5G technology\nright? Absolutely not.\nDisappointingly, the\nspirited debate on Huawei\nhas focused almost exclusively on the national\nsecurity aspect, with\nethical considerations\ntossed aside. When Facebook\u2019s dodgy business\nwith Cambridge Analytica was exposed, Mark\nZuckerberg became the\npariah of the Internet and\npeople were vocal about\nboycotting Facebook\n(how many actually did,\nof course, was a different\nstory). While Huawei\u2019s\nethical deficit far exceeds\nwhat Facebook could\never have done, they have\nlargely dodged the public\nspotlight.\nSeveral years ago,\nCisco came under fire for\nproviding network devices\nto a Chinese censorship\nprogramme. Now the\nChinese government has\nsought cooperation from\nHuawei and the capability\nof the Great Firewall has\nincreased rapidly over the\nlast few years. It is now\nby far the world\u2019s most\nsophisticated censorship\nand mass surveillance\nprogramme, monitoring\nall outbound internet\ntraffic in real-time. As indicated in leaked Xinjiang\ndocuments obtained by\nInternational Consortium\nfor International Journalists (ICIJ), visiting too\nmany foreign websites is\na sufficient transgression\nagainst the regime to be\nthrown into a re-education\ncamp.\nMuch like the Metropolitan Police recently,\nHuawei is also quite\nenthusiastic about the\nuse of automated facial\nrecognition. Huawei is a\nmajor provider both of the\ntechnology itself and the\nsupporting network equipment for AFR cameras,\nwhich has been deployed\nacross China. One of the\npossible uses for Huawei\nproducts advertised on\ntheir website is tracking\npeople\u2019s movements\nacross multiple cameras\nin real-time, obtaining\nthe subject\u2019s identity and\nexactly where the person\nhas been at precisely what\ntime. With Huawei\u2019s help,\nthe Chinese dystopian\nreality may soon render\nCharlie Brooker\u2019s Black\nMirror fantasy into\nmundane thriller.\nMore broadly, Huawei\nis just one of many pawns\nthat willingly facilitated\nChina\u2019s moral race to the\nbottom since Xi\u2019s rise to\npower. While perhaps attitudes towards China are\nstill positive relative to the\ninternational treatment of\napartheid-era SouthAfrica\nthat experienced sports\nboycotts, Olympics expulsion and disinvestments,\nthe CCP has gotten away\nwith its behaviours too\neasily. Huawei\u2019s success\nat gaining a foothold in\nthe UK market is yet more\nmaterial to be used by the\nCCP in the whitewashing\nand moral laundering of\nits way of governance.\nThe British response\nshould be an alarm bell,\na loud and clear call that\nwe are not fine with those\nwho rub shoulders with\nrepressive regimes.\nCode can be audited,\nvulnerability can\nbe fixed, backdoors\ncan be discovered,\nand hardware can be\nreplaced; but you can\u2019t\npatch a moral vacuum.\nThe profit Huawei will\nmake from the UK\nmarket will come out of\nthe pockets of ordinary\nBrits, and much of it\nwill be invested into\nsurveillance, censorship\nand suppression. Cheap\nand fast 5G, as wonderful as it is, cannot\njustify the position\nwe find ourselves in. I\nhope very much I\u2019ll be\nproven wrong, but the\ngovernment\u2019s decision\nmay well be one we\u2019ll\nall come to regret.\nThey do more than just phones // www.vpnsrus.com\n\u201cHuawei is\njust one of\nmany pawns\nthat willingly\nfacillitated\nChina\u2019s moral\nrace to the\nbottom since\nXi\u2019s rise\u201d\nnot pose a serious security\nthreat.\nGiven the fact that\nHuawei\u2019s software is full\nof vulnerable code, and\nthat China is an \u201cadversarial state actor\u201d, it is\ndifficult to ask the public\nto trust Huawei with their\nprivate information. The\ngood news is: we don\u2019t\nneed to. Thanks to end-to-end encryption based\non open standards, open\nsource implementations\nand open collaborations,\n\n"

We sit\ndown with Simran Gill,\nchemist by day and a\nmodel next Friday night,\nto learn more about the\nshow, titled \u201cBillie Jean\nis\u2026 Crazy in love\u201d.\nHi Simran. Thanks\nfor speaking with us\ntoday. So, let\u2019s start\nwith the basics - can\nyou run us through\nthe society\u2019s func-tioning?\nThe Imperial College\nFashion and Design\nsociety is fairly small, but\nat the same time we are\nquite vibrant and active\nthroughout the year. We\nrun a number of socials\neach term, including\nQ&As to regularly engage\nwith non-club members,\nand we also organise visits\nto various fashion exhibitions around the country.\nThe main focus, particularly around this time of\nthe year, is in organising\nthe annual fashion show.\nThat sounds really\ninteresting and fun.\nSome argue that\nfashion and arts are\noften overlooked at\nImperial. Can you\ntalk about some of\nthe challenges the\nsociety has faced in\nmaking fashion part\nof the discussion?\nBeing a university\nthat focuses primarily on\nSTEM subjects, there isn\u2019t\na strong focus on, say, arts\nand fashion. That said,\nI do believe that there is\nsignificant interest in the\nstudent population, and\ntheir diverse backgrounds\nand unique perspective\ncertainly expands the\nfashion and arts conversation than narrowing it. We\nhave strong support and\nturnout for our events, and\nengagement outside it.\nAnd events like this\nhelp the wider student population to\nengage in that con-versation.\nYes, certainly. Plus,\nit\u2019s always fun revisiting\nvogues and celebrating\nthem with today\u2019s per-spective. Like, these\nevents can be an amazing\nopportunity to bring back\nyesteryear trends and incorporate them in today\u2019s\nstyle.\nSpeaking of the\nevent. The show is\ntitled\u2018Billie Jean is...\nCrazy in love\u2019and is\npegged as a sort of\na contrast between\nfashion trends of the\n80s and the 00s. Can\nyou expand on the\ntheme and how it\ncame to be?\nYeah \u2014 it is envisaged\nas a battle between the\ndecades 80s and the 00s\nand their different fashion\nstyles. We contrast the\ntrends in different categories of clothing in these\ntwo decades, like for\nexample swimwear. It is a\nfashion show but more so\nan entertainment show\u2026\nso the walks are designed\nin a fun way and so we\nhave songs reflecting the\nhighlights from leading\nartists of the decade,\nMichael Jackson and\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2026 that tie in well\nwith our primary purpose\nof looking at the trends in\nthese two decades.\nAnd what do you see\nas the pivotal shifts\nbetween these two\ndecades in terms of\nfashion?\n80s was hugely influenced by neon colours,\nleg warmers and slap\nbracelets. Whereas 00s\nhad track suits, colourful\nbraids, low rise jeans\nand crop tops. And we\nbelieve there are a lot of\nelements that are seeing\na comeback and we want\nthe event to highlight and\ncelebrate these\u2026 like\nneon colours for example.\nYou can expect to see a lot\nof this in the event.\nI hear that we have\nsome dresses from\ninternational labels\nfor the show?\nYes. We have dresses\nfrom top designer houses,\nwho have donated clothes\nto us as student models\nto present them in the\nfashion show.\nWe also hear that\nthere are also collaborative acts with the\na cappella group\u2018The\nImperielles\u2019and the\ndance society\u2018Funkology\u2019in store at the\nevent?\nThisisnotaconventional fashion show. Although\nit is to show the dresses\nand the designers work,\nit is an entertainment\npiece as well. So, we have\namazing performances\nin store, The Imperielles\nare going to give a wonderful performance and\nFunkology have a highly\nenergetic dance designed\nto keep the audience on\nthe edge of their seats.\nWrapping up\u2026 as\na charity show, this\nyear the proceedings\nare to be donated to\nthe charity organization ClientEarth? Can\nyou talk a bit about\ntheir work and why\nyou chose this organ-ization?\nAll the profits from the\nshow are going to ClientEarth, an environmental law firm. Their work\nis really inspiring and\nhighly relevant in today\u2019s\nclimate. Like in 2016,\nthey were instrumental in\nblocking the Polnoc plant,\nthe new largest coal power\nplant in Europe. And\nnow they are currently\nworking along indigenous\npeople of Australia to\nchallenge their governments\u2019 climate failings\nat the UN. Their work is\nreally important and as a\nclub that strongly believes\nin sustainable fashion, we\nfelt the match was perfect\nand we really hope the\nevent is a success.\nYou can see Simran\nGillwalk the runway for\nIC Fashion and Design\nSociety\u2019s Charity Fashion\nShow: Billie Jean is\u2026\nCrazy In Love on the 7th\nFebruary in the Union\nConcert Hall.

Now\na team at Copenhagen\nUniversity, together with\nCaroline Albertin at the\nUnited States\u2019 Marine\nBiology Laboratory, has\nsequenced its genome in a\nbid to unpick the science\nbehind its secrets. How\ndid it evolve to be so\nbig? Why did it develop\nthe biggest brain of any\ninvertebrate alive today?\nFirst sighted in 1848 by\nthe crew of the Daedalus\nin the waters just off the\nCape of Good Hope, the\ngiant squid took its first\ntentative strokes out of\nfolklore; although the\nscientific world was not\nyet ready to be convinced.\nDanish zoologist Japetus\nSteenstrup took up the\nchallenge, drawing on\nbiological knowledge \u2013\nonly a few washed up,\noversized squid \u2018beaks\nand pieces\u2019 in evidence\n\u2013 to propose a believable\ngiant squid-like animal\ntruly existing behind the\nlegends. He gave the\nanimal the name Architeuthis dux, and by the\n1880s, after the discovery\nof several dead specimens\nacross the world\u2019s oceans,\nthe giant squid stepped\nout of fiction and became\nfact.\nHowever, the giant\nsquid is hardly much\nmore understood today\nthan in those first, early\ndays of discovery in the\n1800s. It wasn\u2019t until\n2004 that the first photos\nwere taken; and 2006\nwhen video footage of one\nfloating near the surface\nwas first recorded. It took\nuntil 2012 for substantial\nfootage of the beast in\naction to be shot, and it\nwas only last year that the\nsecond footage of a giant\nsquid in the ocean depths\nwas filmed, a fleeting\nglimpse of graceful tentacles snatching at a lure.\nScience has added\na few more titillating\nfacts to our knowledge\nof the giant squid than\njust photographic\nevidence; we know that\nit has three hearts, a blue,\ncopper-based blood, a\ndoughnut-shaped brain,\nthe largest eyes of any\nliving animal, and a jet\npropulsion system that\ncan propel itself forwards\nand backwards. But, fundamental questions still\nremain.\nThe giant squid has\n\u201cmany complex and\nelaborate features\u201d, as\nDr Albertin, the MBL\nmember of the team, puts\nit, but \u201cthey are thought\nto have evolved independently of vertebrates.\u201d\nSo, the Copenhagen University-led team hoped\nthat its genome could\nprovide some answers;\nit would be the biggest\nadvance in genetic information on the giant squid\nsince it was discovered\nin 2013 that all giant\nsquids (from those that\nroam the polar seas to\nthose inhabiting tropical\noceans) belong to the\nsame species.\nThere was only one\nproblem \u2013 fresh DNA\nsamples from a species\nthat spends its time in the\ndeepest, darkest depths\nare not easy to come by.\nSo, instead, the team had\nto use tissue samples from\ndead specimens, which\ncan lower the integrity of\nthe available DNA and\nlead to an incomplete\ndataset. To combat this,\nthe team also isolated\nthe proteins in the tissue\nsample, so that by working\nforwards from the DNA\nand backwards from the\nend-product proteins, the\nholes in the dataset were\neasier to patch up.\nAs a result, we can\nnow add to our small\nrepository of giant squid\nstats that these creatures\nhave a genome around\n90% the size of ours; 2.7\nbillion DNA base pairs\nagainst our 3 billion, and\nconsisting of 33,406 pro-tein-coding genes.\nIt was within these\ncoding sequences that the\nfirst answers were found.\nThe giant squid\u2019s brain,\nthat doughnut shaped ring\nfar more sophisticated\nthan those other invertebrates possess, may now\nmake more evolutionary\nsense following the\nteam\u2019s discovery of 135\nprotocadherin genes in its\ngenome.\n\u201cProtocadherins are\nthought to be important\nin wiring up a complicated brain correctly,\u201d Dr\nAlbertin says. \u201cThey were\nthought to be a vertebrate\ninnovation, so we were\nreally surprised when\nwe found more than 100\nof them in the octopus\ngenome, in 2015. That\nseemed like a smoking\ngun to how you make a\ncomplicated brain. And\nwe have found a similar\nexpansion of protocadher-ins in the giant squid, as\nwell.\u201d\nAnd the brain is not\nthe only rarity bordering\non the impossible when it\ncomes to the giant squid.\nThought to be relatively short-lived with just\na five-year lifespan, the\ncreature is not only big,\nbut must grow rapidly to\nachieve its infamous size.\nBy analysing certain DNA\nsequences responsible for\ndevelopment and growth\nthat are well-conserved\nacross animal life, clues\nabout this speedy growth\nspurt were hoped to be un-covered. Intriguingly, the\nteam were able to discount\none possibility of how the\ncreature got its name \u2013 the\nevidence showed that the\ngiant squid has only one\ncopy of these important\nsequences, the Wnt and\nHox genes, which ruled\nout whole genome dupli-cation. Whole genome\nduplication is a method\nwhich increases genome\ncomplexity through duplicating it in its entirety.\nSpare copies allow for\nmutations and therefore\nspur on substantial evolutionary changes \u2013 such as\na dramatic growth pattern.\nThe Kraken, drawn from sailor reports in 1801 //\nPierre D\u00e9nys de Montfort\n\u201cThe giant\nsquid is hardly\nmuch more\nunderstood\ntoday than\nin those first,\nearly days of\ndiscovery in\nthe 1800s\u201d\nThe genome did,\nhowever, have a high\nproportion of transpos-able elements \u2013 sections\nof genetic code that are\nable to move within the\ngenome, introducing\ninstability and therefore\nanother major contributor\nto evolutionary change.\nBy analysing the extent\nof genetic change in\nthe transposed gene\ncompared to its starting\nsequence, the team found\nsuggestions of a recent\nburst of activity in these\nelements, comparative\nto related squid species.\nBut to connect this\nactivity directly to the\ngiant squid\u2019s size requires\nfurther unpicking.\nSo, is the giant squid\na mystery no more? Has\nthe enigma of the Kraken\nbeen cracked? Although\nthe genome sequence and\nprotein library begin to\nfill in the blanks, it seems\nthere is still plenty left to\ncatch our curiosity \u2013 and\nour imagination.\nThe giant squid // Karen Kay, Museum of Natural History, (CC BY 2.0)\n\n"

Partly, that's\nbecause certain episodes\ncan be quite harrowing - I\ngenuinely took a break\nafter the ending scenes\nof episode three left me\nrather disturbed. Maybe\nI'm just weak-willed and\nshould be culled from the\ngene pool.\nBut that sense of horror,\nrevulsion, and morbid fascination did not put me off\n- just affected my pacing.\nI still find myself creeping\nback for another taste of\nepic fantasy mixed with a\nsort of gothic horror vibe.\nStrip that drama from\ntheshow,andit'dbedecent\n- but lacking something.\nWith it, I look forward\nto devouring more. Upon\nfinishing, though, I'm sure\nI will feel a little relieved\nto have escaped that irresistible attraction to the\nmorbid, the sense of not\nbeing able to look away.\nThat's why films like Saw\nor The Human Centipede\nexist, too.\nThat's also how I think\nwe all feel about Brexit,\nif we're being honest with\nourselves.\nThe last few years have,\nfrankly, been a f*cking\ntrainwreck for British\npolitics. We've seen\nweak Prime Ministers, an\nall-enveloping stagnancy\nand lack of satisfaction\nwith the status quo, and\na complete lack of any\nreal impetus to change\nthose things. I think most\npeople reading this feel\nbroadly unrepresented\nby even the party they\nvoted for. How many of\nyou simply voted for the\n'lesser evil', whatever\nyou consider that to be?\nHow many genuinely feel\nin-sync with the majority\nof the politicians in your\nrespective parties? Even if\none or two seem to speak\ngenuine sense to you, the\nrest are utterly useless and\nineffectual twats. Don't\ndeny it.\nAnd so we've trundled\non, with a sort of obsessive inward-facing\nself-introspection that\nhasn't been the focus of\nBritish politics in some\ntime. It's been drama on\nour own home soil, and it's\nbeen some of the biggest\ndrama on the continent.\nThat's not totally normal\nfor us. It's been quite a\nwhile since we were this\nplagued with doubt; the\ncharacter of Britain's\npolitical discourse, to me,\nseems to have devolved\ninto resembling more the\nself-conscious thoughts\nof a preoccupied teenager\nthan a mature and established state.\nIt's been a bit horrific,\nreally, having to face our-selves, our own flaws, our\nown errors. Very un-Brit-ish, to have such a turgid\nand quivering upper lip.\nMaybe it'll all turn out\nokay, a learning process\nfor the new generation.\nBut now the drama is\n'over', so to speak. Not\non the political level, of\ncourse - there's still lots\nto do there. That is a hot,\nhot mess. But in terms of\nhow this reaches down\nand affects our daily\ninteractions, the long wait\nis finally over. We're out.\nIt's done. Bish-bash-bosh.\nThe debates and arguments that have fuelled\ndiscourse - both externally and, I think, internally\nto ourselves - for so long\nare moot.\nFor three years, we\nall stood at the edge of a\nfoggy cliff, not knowing\nwhether jumping would\nresult in flight or death.\nThe arguing about what\nto do has been vital, but it\nhas also forced us to look\ninto the void, to question\nand define ourselves, and\nthat's affected us as a\nsociety and as individuals.\nHarrowing, yes.\nBut also just a little bit\naddictive. A bit morbidly\nfascinating.\nWith the date set, I\nnoticed a distinct drop-off\nin the number of furious\nrants I witnessed on social\nmedia. While I'm sure\nmany who consider themselves political pundits\nare still furiously typing\naway, keyboard warriors\nto the last, the average\nperson has suddenly gone\nquiet where before they\nwere just so freaking\nopinionated. Nobody - I\nrepeat, nobody - wrote\nanything on it to Felix this\nweek; our editors took up\nthe mantle instead. That is\ngenuinely shocking.\nPartially it's because it\nfeels that there isn't much\npoint to arguing anymore.\nBut, really, there is. If\nsomeone really cares\nabout Brexit on a political\nlevel, there is still so much\nto do, and plenty to argue\nabout.\nNo, I think it's because\nthat dark addictive drama\nis over. It's no longer\nfashionable to take a side,\nit's no longer an ongoing\ncultural war, it's no longer\nabout self-questioning\nand defining the direction\nof a generation. It's no\nlonger such an attractive\nmess. It's just a very politically involved one. It\nhas to do with things like\ntariffs. That is definitely\nmore boring than calling\nthe big B.J. a dickhead\nand getting 32 likes. Good\none.\nAnd, just like I anticipate finishing The Witcher\nto be, it's a bit relieving\nto finally set down our\nwell-worn pitchforks and\ntorches.\nI do worry a little that\nburning ourselves and\nour political fervour out\nnow will allow the current\ngovernment to enact\nlegislation that otherwise\nwouldn't go unquestioned\n(Human Rights Act,\nanyone?) However, I\nthink it's necessary. This\nis the quiet little cry and\nmoment of clarity and\npeace you have after a\nbig argument with your\npartner, or after getting\na bad exam result back.\nCathartic, but necessary.\nBut we can't let it go on\ntoo long, without falling\ninto a sort of placid depression that ultimately is\nmore damaging than the\ninternal war we've faced\ncould ever be.\n2\n\n"

By and large this\nwill be marked not with\nspit\ufb01re displays and ringing of Big Ben but with\na restrained hour long\ncountdown projected onto\nDowning Street and the\nissue of a commemorative\n50p coin. These are not\nthe sort of festivities that\nare typically brought\nout when large events\noccur. Remembering\nthe enormous show of\naffection and celebration\nthat greeted the wedding\nof Harry and Megan, two\nroyals that would never\nascend the throne, it is astonishing that the leaving\nof the EU, an event with\nfar greater signi\ufb01cance,\nwould not be marked in\nsome way. This re\ufb02ects\nthe government and\nmany people\u2019s attitude\nthat the last 4 years have\nbeen an embarrassing\ndisplay for a nation that\nconsiders itself a cradle\nof democracy. That many\nforeign publications refer\nto our Prime Minister as a\n\u2018Mini Trump\u2019 is yet more\nevidence of how far we\nhave fallen.\nPeople that didn\u2019t\nrealise that today was\nthe day need not panic.\nWe shouldn\u2019t notice any\ngreat changes as Britain\nmust remain regulatorar-ily aligned with the EU\nuntil the end of the year\nas part of a transition\nperiod during which the\nfuture relationship must\nbe worked out.\nThe challenges that\nface us now, however,\ndwarf those that filled\nmeters of print columns\nwhile we as nation con-vulsed, trying to come to\nan agreement over what\nall those crosses next to\nthe Leave box meant.\nFirst and foremost,\nwe must look to the\nstate of our Union. The\nUnited Kingdom is not a\nsingle nation but rather\na collection of four\nconstituent nations all\ngoverned by the government of their shared\nmonarch. The ties that\nbind these nations\ntogether, however, are\nlooking more precarious than they have in\ncenturies. The Scottish\nNationalists have mo-nopolised the country\u2019s\nWestminster MPs and\nshould they similarly\ncarry the vote in national\nelections to Holyrood,\ntheir devolved legis-lature, Johnson will\nfind it difficult to deny\nNicola Sturgeon her\ndesired Indyref2, a\nsecond referendum on\nScottish independence.\nSimilarly, the December\nelection was significant\nin how Northern Irish\nconstituencies changed\nhands. Rather than\nbeing dominated by\nthe two extreme voices\nof Unionism and Nationalism, other parties\nmanaged to break\nthrough and gained\nseats. However, this\nmarked the first election\nwhere Nationalist parties\n(pro unification with the\nRepublic of Ireland)\noutnumbered Unionist\nones (pro remaining part\nof the United Kingdom).\nThe end of freedom of\nmovement also has the\npotential to open old\nwounds from the days\nof the Troubles. Many\npeople do not understand\nthe huge place that those\nyears of terror have in\nthe minds of people from\nNorthern Ireland and I\nwould recommend the\nBBC series Spotlight on\nthe Troubles to anyone\nseeking to inform themselves about this vital\nbut overlooked part of\nour nation\u2019s history. The\nlong held belief in these\nregions that Westminster cares only for the\nconcerns of England has\nonly been strengthened\nby the Brexit result\nand the Conservatives\nshould not just consider\nthe concerns of the\nNorthern constituencies\nthat \u2018lent\u2019 votes to the\nTories, a clear example\nof factionalism and pork\nbarrel politics, but the\nwhole country that they\nclaim to represent.\nSecondly, the issue\nof social care must be\naddressed. Successive\ngovernments have\nkicked the issue down\nthe road and the only\nattempt to do so seriously by the May administration was destroyed\nby the moniker of the\n\u2018Dementia tax\u2019. We as a\nnation must confront the\nlooming burden that our\nincreasing life expectancy and demographics\nthreaten us with. It has\nbeen predicted that following current trends, 1\nin 3 people born this year\nwill suffer from some\nsort of dementia. In 5\nyears there are predicted\nto be 150,000 more\nsufferers and 1,150,000\nmore by 2050. Unless\nwe as a nation confront\nthis, it will be a black\nhole in the health budget\nthat could bring down\nthe valuable institution\nof the NHS. The Prime\nMinister has been\nmaking the right noises,\nrecently claiming that\ninitiatives could begin as\nearly as March, but his\ninsistence that people\nwill not have to sell\ntheir homes to pay for\ncare threatens to make\nany policy implemented\nwindow dressing on the\nworsening crisis.\nFinally, the government should address\npolitical apathy. If, as\na nation, we cannot\nconvince the youth\nof the value of our\ndemocratic system then\nthe ideology that we\npreach deserves to fail.\nSchool students should\nbe taught how both our\npolitical and economic\nsystems work. In\n1996, New York Times\ncolumnist Thomas\nFriedman wrote: \u2018You\ncould almost say that we\nlive again in a two-su-perpower world. There\nis the US and there is\nMoody\u2019s. The US can\ndestroy a country by\nleveling it with bombs;\nMoody\u2019s can destroy a\ncountry by downgrading\nits bonds.\u2019 Many readers\nwill struggle to say what\nMoody\u2019s is. There are\nincredibly powerful\nforces that define how\nwe live our lives that we\nhave little to no knowledge of.\nToday represents the\nfirst step of a healing\nprocess that we must\nwalk together to do right\nfor the people of the\nnation.\nPost-Brexit, there are dire issues the government needs to address // Public Domain\n\u201cThe US can\ndestroy a\ncountry by\nleveling it\nwith bombs;\nMoody\u2019s can\ndestroy a\ncountry by\ndowngrading\nits bonds\u201d\n\u201cThat many\nforeign\npublications\nrefer to our\nPrime Minister\nas a\u2018Mini\nTrump\u2019is yet\nmore evidence\nof how far we\nhave fallen\u201d\n\n"

These officers\nare senior volunteer\nroles at the Union with\na lot of responsibility,\nand throughout my 2.5\nyears being involved in\nUnion welfare, I\u2019ve seen\nthat being able to do the\nrole fully and well is impossible for one person.\nAs Deputy President\n(Welfare), Liberation and\nCommunity falls under\nmy responsibility, along\nwith ensuring that all\nofficers are supported.\nThis drove me to look at\nways we can change the\nstructure around Liberation and Community to\nmake sure that the Union\nis successfully representing the students we claim\nwe do.\nLiberation Reform\nProject\nThis led to a Liberation\nReform project \u2013 which I\nwas keen to be a co-pro-duced piece of work with\nthe Union\u2019s Community\nand Welfare Board, primarily the Liberation and\nCommunity Officers who\nsit on it. After setting up a\nworking group and having\ndiscussions at this board,\nwe came to a proposal\nfor Union Council which\npassed 32 to 1. There\nwere two key parts to this\nproposal, and you can\nread the full paper on the\nUnion website.\n1. Introduce Liberation and Community\nNetworks chaired by the\nrespective Liberation\nand Community Officer.\nThese networks will have\nsimilarities to clubs and\nsocieties in that they are\ngroups students can join\nand will have commit-tees. However, they will\ndiffer in the sense that\ntheir main purpose is to\ncampaign and advocate.\nThe key benefit of this is\nthat it allows Liberation\nand Community officers\nto be supported and to\nspread the workload in a\nstudent-led, democratic\nfashion. My hope is that\nthese networks will be\nable to do more campaigns\nto improve the experience\nof the students they represent without overloading\none officer.\n2 Introduce a\nWorking Class Officer,\nalong with a Working\nClass Students Network,\nto represent students from\ndisadvantaged socio-eco-nomic backgrounds.\nWhere did this new\nofficer come from?\nInlate2019,theCollege\nagreed a five-year Access\nand Participation\nPlan with the Office for\nStudents, who are the regulator for universities in\nEngland. This plan ties the\nCollege to achieving key\ntargets around increasing\nthe numbers of students\nwho come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nThe two key measures of\nthis are the IMD (Index\nof Multiple Deprivation) which score small\nregions in England based\non relative deprivation,\nand POLAR4 (Partici-pation Of Local Areas)\nwhich rates participation\nin education across different postcodes. Both are\nmost commonly described\nin terms of quintiles,\nwhere Q5 for both represents the least deprived/\nhighest participation\nareas. According to the\nplan, considering Undergraduate home student\nadmissions, there is a gap\nbetween IMD Q1 and Q5\nof 24.8% and POLAR4 Q1\nand Q5 by 54.2%. Whilst\nthis aligns strongly with\nthe general perception of\nstudents at Imperial, it\u2019s\nquite alarming to see the\nnumbers on paper. A huge\n55% of the UG home\nstudent population come\nfrom POLAR4 Q5, the\nquintile with the highest\nparticipation rate in higher\neducation.\nThe concerning statistics don\u2019t stop just with\nadmission rates, though\nless significant; there\nare also gaps in success\nrates for different groups\nof students upon arrival\nto Imperial. The continuation rate for students\nfrom POLAR Q5 is\nas to why this is the case\naren\u2019t very well explored\nin the Access and Participation Plan, or elsewhere.\nThe plan has set targets\nto increase the proportion\nof POLAR Q1 and Q2\nstudents, and IMD Q1\nstudents, with the aim of\nequalising the numbers\nacross all quintiles in\n50 years. In terms of\nsuccess, the plan says the\nCollege will monitor gaps\nin success but doesn\u2019t\nseek to close the gap as\nit deems it not currently\nsignificant enough.\nThe College are putting\nconsiderable energy into\nbringing in students from\nsocio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds,\nbut are not equally considering what provision\nto put in place to ensure\nthese students are able\nto succeed to the same\nextent as their peers. If\na student from an IMD\nQ1 area has accessed\nImperial through the same\nadmissions criteria as a\nstudent from an IMD Q5\narea, the question I ask\nmyself is then \u201cWhat is it\nabout Imperial that makes\nstudents from disadvantaged socio-economic\nbackgrounds less likely to\nsucceed?\u201d\nThis is where the Union\ncomes in. We have a duty\nto represent the interests\nand needs of all students,\nand to particularly focus\non disadvantaged and\nunderrepresented groups.\nThis is the primary reasoning for introducing a new\nWorking Class Officer.\nI envision a large part\nof this role will be to try\nand answer the question\nabove and start to change\nthese things. When\nYork Students\u2019 Union\nintroduced an officer with\nthis same name, they\ncommissioned a research\nproject conducted by this\nofficer to try and establish\nwhat the experience of\ndisadvantaged students\nat York is. This project\nfound that challenges\nfaced were far broader\nthan financial, and that\nstudents in the Working\nClass Students Network\nfelt culture shock and that\nthey were \u201cthe odd one\nout\u201d. You can find out\nmore about this at https://\nwonkhe.com/blogs-sus/\nshould-sus-elect-a-work-ing-class-officer/. I think\nit would be fascinating for\na similar piece of work to\nhappen at Imperial.\nWhy the name\u2018Working Class Officer\u2019?\nWhile it was quickly\nand unanimously decided\nto introduce an officer\nwith the remit of representing students from disadvantaged backgrounds\nat the Union\u2019s Community and Welfare Board,\nthe question of what to\nname it was a lot harder\nto resolve. The initial reactions to Working Class\nOfficer weren\u2019t particularly positive, with some\nmembers mentioning that\nthe term has negative\nconnotations and it might\nbe received negatively by\nthe student body. We discussed other names such\nas Widening Participation,\nAccess and Participation,\nClass Equality and many\nmore but none of these\nfully resonated with the\nboard. Whilst it was\nagreed that all these\nterms are more positive\nsounding, Council felt\nthat students wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily associate them\nwith the actual remit of\nthe officer being created.\nFurthermore, there were\npeople in the room who\nfelt it was best to simply\nname the officer after the\ngroup of students being\nrepresented, like most\nother Liberation Officers.\nIt was felt that this\nname is the most direct\n\u201cImperial\ndoesn\u2019t admit\na proportional\nnumber of\nstudents from\ndeprived\nareas, and\nthe ones who\nare here are\nmore likely to\ndrop out and\nless likely to\nachieve good\ndegrees\u201d\n4.2% higher than that of\nPOLAR Q1, and the rate\nof students who receive\n\u2018good degrees\u2019 (1s or\n2.1s) is approximately\n4% lower in the two most\ndeprived quintiles of IMD\ncompared to the least\ndeprived quintile.\nImperial doesn\u2019t admit\na proportional number of\nstudents from deprived\nareas, and the ones who\nare here are more likely to\ndrop-out and less likely to\nachieve good degrees.\nThis paints a somewhat\nbleak picture. Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t admit a proportional number of students\nfrom deprived areas, and\nthe ones who are here are\nmore likely to drop-out\nand less likely to achieve\ngood degrees. The reasons\n\u201cThroughout\nmy 2.5 years\nbeing involved\nin Union\nwelfare, I\u2019ve\nseen that\nbeing able to\ndo these roles\nfully and well\nis impossible\nfor one\nperson\u201d\n\n"

Millions\nhave protested this bill\nand the response by the\ngovernment has included\npolice brutality and more\ninternet shutdowns. The\nHindu nationalism created\nby the BJP\u2019s draconian\npolicies has the potential\nto further slow the Indian\neconomy and cause more\nunrest.\nPresent\nBecause of Modi\u2019s\ndivisive policies, along\nwith an overall global\neconomic slowdown due\nto other factors such as\nthe US-China trade war,\nIndia\u2019s economy has\nslowed down to 4.75% in\n2019. Additionally, during\nthe infrastructure boom in\nthe previous decade, many\ncompanies couldn\u2019t repay\ntheir debts to the banks and\nthus banks were resisting\ngiving out as many loans.\nShadow banks began to\nform and fund projects,\nand these non-bank \ufb01nancial companies (NBFC)\nbegan to give out loans\nto both companies and\nindividuals. At their peak\nshadow banks accounted\nfor 1/3 of all loans given\nout nationwide. A major\nshadow-bank, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial\nServices Ltd (IL&FS), defaulted on payments. This\nshook the Indian economy\nand had a particular\nimpact in the automotive\nindustry as nearly 65%\ncommercial vehicle sales\nwere from NBFCs. The\nautomotive industry is\none of India\u2019s largest, employing 35 million people.\nDue to this collapse of\nIL&FS, ripples were felt\nthrough the economy, car\nNarendra Modi: India\u2019s Prime Minister // Wikimedia\nGDP % share of the world\u2019s biggest economies, 1AD to 2009 // CIA World Factbook\nsales dropped, and due\nto decreased demand,\nan estimated 100,000\njobs were lost. Despite\nthis, consumer spending\nremains high, with many\nIndian households still\ntaking out loans which\ncould potentially become\na harmful situation if\nunemployment keeps\nrising and people begin to\ndefault on their payments.\nThe immediate future\nis looking bleak; unemployment has been rising\nsince 2017 and the IMF\nhas cut India\u2019s 2020\ngrowth forecast from 7%\nto 5.8%.

Also, how to study to music\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nI\nlike to think I\u2019m quite\noptimistic about\nmusic. It is a very\nsubjective medium\nand almost any piece of\nmusic can have value to\nanyone. But I draw the\nline at lo-fi beat compi-lations. Using lo-fi beats\nas study music should\nbe considered a cardinal\nsin. Walking through any\nlibrary, you see the vast\nmajority of people with\ntheir headphones on. The\nidea that a single person is\nplugged into \u201cLo-Fi beats\nto relax/study to\u201d sends a\nshiver down my spine.\nRecently, someone\nrecommended a lo-fi\nstudy compilation to me\nthat I hated so intensely\nit inspired me to write\nthis. Though before I sat\ndown to rant and rave\nabout \u201cLo-Fi beats to\nrelax/study to\u201d I thought\nit\u2019d be good to know if\nstudying and listening to\nmusic should even happen\nsimultaneously. So, I did\nsome research (aka pro-crastination).\nThe most commonly\nknown music induced\nintelligence phenomenon\nis the \u201cMozart Effect\u201d, but\nit\u2019s often misunderstood.\nListening to Mozart does\nnot inherently make you\nsmarter. Listening to\nmusic that puts you in a\ngood mood before a study\nsesh improves memory\nand mental functioning\nfor a short period of time.\nThis can be any kind of\nmusic. All those people\nthat \u2018oNLy LisTN tO\nclAsSicAL mUsIc wHilE\nsTUdyInG\u2019 can get off\ntheir high horse.\nSo, before you sit down\nin front of your screen\nbe sure to bust out the\nbangers that boost your\nmood.\nWhen it comes to\nmusic while studying\nthere are just a few simple\ndos and don\u2019ts to prevent\nit becoming detrimental:\n\u2022 Avoid music with\nlyrics. If you\u2019re\nworking with\nnumbers this is less\nof a problem, but if\nyou\u2019re reading or\nwriting this is a big\nno no.\n\u2022 Aggressive/chaotic\nmusic is generally\ngoing to distract\nyou and has been\nshown to greatly\nreduce focus.\n\u2022 Moderate/steady\nmusic is the best\nv i b e to go for\n(which might make\nyou think that lo-fi\nbeats are good but\ndon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll get\nto that later).\n\u2022 Monotonous/repetitive music should\nbe avoided, it\u2019ll\nend up putting you\nto sleep.\n\u2022 Keep the volume to\na minimum. You\u2019re\nprobably already\nin a library so you\ndon\u2019t need it loud.\n\u2022 If you\u2019re doing\nm e m o r i s a t i o n\nwork, it\u2019s generally best to not be\nlistening to music\nat all. Got a stack\nof flashcards to run\nthrough? Cut the\nmusic and make it\na treat in between\ndecks.\nDespite having just\nlaid out rules to follow,\nthe advice of the experts\nis that \u201cit depends\u201d.\nMusic that improves your\nmood also improves your\nmental functioning and\nendurance. So, taking 20\nminutes to listen to some\nKendrick or Bowie might\nhelp you stick around in\nthe library for an extra\nhour. Maybe adding a few\nKAYTRANADA bops\nto your queue is going to\nmake that lecture you\u2019ve\nbeen putting off a little\nless miserable. Only you\ncan say what\u2019s best for\nyou.\nOkay, so if listening to\nmusic while studying is\nnot a bad thing, then why\nis listening to lo-fi beats\nthe worst?\nI don\u2019t want to come\nacross too harsh. As stated\nbefore, music is subjec-tive. If you love \u201cLo-Fi\nbeats to relax/study to\u201d,\nthen by all means don\u2019t let\nmy hatred of it get in your\nway. Objectively though\nit\u2019s bad and you should\nstop.\nIf you\u2019re going to\nlifelessly spend endless\nhours of your youth in\nfront of a computer screen\nindoors, you might as\nwell give that a decent\nsoundtrack. Don\u2019t listen\nto shitty music designed\nto lack originality, be for-Look at all the amazing things you could be listening to instead // Respective Record Labels\ngettable and not engage.\nYou wouldn\u2019t do this to\nany of your other senses.\nImagine how much of a\nlunatic you would be if\nyou ate plain pasta while\nstudying so that you\nwouldn\u2019t get distracted.\nIs that the kind of world\nyou want to live in? Next\ntime I walk into Tesco\nI expect to see a \u201cwhite\nbread and cucumber\nsandwich to study/relax\nto\u201d on the shelves. Please\ndon\u2019t rot your brain with\nflavourless sound. Turn\nthe music off if you think\nyou\u2019re getting distracted.\nTo be fair, sometimes\ncertain situations call\nfor bland music. Lo-fi\n\u201cIf you\u2019re\ngoing to\nlifelessly\nspend endless\nhours of your\nyouth in front\nof a computer\nscreen indoors,\nyou might\nas well give\nthat a decent\nsoundtrack.\u201d\n\n"

This minimal-istic setting could not be\nin greater contrast to the\nsubject matter of this play\nfor it addresses the fundamental question that has\nfascinated and frightened\npeople throughout histo-ry: Is God real? Tackling\nsuch a heavy debate is\nmore than daring and I\nwas astounded at how\nmasterfully it was ex-plored, although perhaps\nI should not be so quick\nto doubt one of my favourite authors, Cormack\nMcCarthy. This play is the\ndebut of his work to the\nLondon stage and it did\nnot disappoint.\nThe performance\nbegins mid-conversation\nand from the outset, the\nattitude is sombre and\nintimate. The audience\ndiscovers that the two\nmen are nothing more\nthan strangers, brought\ntogether by a chance\nencounter at the edge of a\nsubway platform. White,\nplayed by Jasper Britton,\nis dubbed a \u2018terminal\ntraveller\u2019, prevented from\ntaking his \ufb01nal journey by\nGary Beadle\u2019s Black. The\ntwo now sit in Black\u2019s\napartment and ruminate\non redemption and the\nvery meaning of life,\nwhich is non-existent for\nWhite.\nThe two men are\nextreme opposites.\nBritton\u2019s White exudes\nanxiety and defeat with\nevery word and action.\nHe nervously evades all\nof Black\u2019s questions and\nphysically tries to leave\nthe apartment countless\ntimes throughout the per-formance. However, he\nis persistently convinced\nto stay by Beadle\u2019s\ncharacter, Black. Beadle\nis inviting to both the\naudience and, despite his\ndefences, White. He is\njovial, attentive, and kind,\ndespite White\u2019s constant\nrebuffs. He is also a\ndevout religious charac-ter, quite different to the\n\ufb01rm atheist that White is\nrevealed to be; one could\neven go as far to say\nWhite scorns religion and\nso the pair butt heads on\nthis topic constantly.\nDue to White\u2019s misery\nand dismissiveness, the\naudience does not warm\nto him so readily, but\nthis is not to say that he\nis actively disliked; he is\njust adamant in his -albeit\nbleak- beliefs and willing\nto defend them. The same\ncould be said for Black,\nbut it manifests in a\ndifferent way. He is more\nopen and, in a bid to get\nWhite talking, we learn\na lot about his conversion to Christianity and\ntroubled past. White may\nrefuse to reveal anything\ntruly personal, but it is\nstill evident that he has\nexperienced a pain that\nchanged him too. In this\nway, we are driven to pity\nWhite. His pain drove him\nnot to religion but to the\ntrain and it beckons him;\nJust as the bible remains\non the table between the\ntwo men throughout their\nconversation, the noises\nof the nearby subway are\na constant and terrible\npresence.\nThe Sunset Limited\ntakes a dark look at God\nthrough the eyes of de-pression. Black\u2019s humour\nand brotherly affection\ndull the blow, but it is\nstill a challenging watch.\nTo say I enjoyed the play\njust doesn\u2019t seem right but\nthat\u2019s what I would say of\na good play; a great play\nsuch as this is one that\ngets you thinking during\nthe tube journey home and\nin the days that follow.\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nTesni HaddonMcMillan\nArts Writer\nWhere?

However, this\nserved as a good wakeup\ncall for IC as they came\nout back from the restart\nfired up. Once possession\nwas regained the boys\nshowed how good they\ncan be in attack. Despite\nthe wet conditions, the\nboys played some beautiful free flowing, attacking\nrugby which climaxed\nwith Amin throwing a\nbeautiful cut-out pass to\nIsaac Bailey whose superb\noffload allowed ICURFC\nto get their first try of the\nday.\nAfter this very well\nworked try not much more\ncan be said about the first\nhalf. The wet ball resulted\nin scrum after scrum and\nquestionable decisions\nby the referee meant IC\nfound themselves camped\non their own try line for\nthe majority of the half.\nOne dimensional attack\nfrom Hertfordshire and\ngutsy defending from IC\nmeant that despite all the\npressure, Hertfordshire\ncouldn\u2019t manage to get\nover the line. Players to\nthank for this include\nIsaac Bailey and Nick\nU-A who dominated the\nHertfordshire centres,\nOllie Adams who makes\nbigger hits than a ~2000\nBritney Spears and Sean\nNakai who chops more\nankles than Louis Benson\n(claims) he chops pints.\nSean also managed to\nbag a try in the first half.\nHertfordshire had clearly\ndone their research and\nfound that ICURFC have\na lineout maul that moves\nfaster than the Coronavirus. To combat this they\nattempted to stand off and\nhope to gain a penalty\nfor obstruction. Although\nthis worked the first time,\nthe next time they tried it\nSean just grabbed the ball\nand sprinted through the\nunaware Hertfordshire\npack.\nThe second half was\nquite different as IC\nmanaged to gain much\nmore possession and\nplay in the right areas. It\nwasn\u2019t long before IC had\nan attacking lineout in the\nHertfordshire 22. Toby\nDaniels, threw a darts\nMichael Van Gerwen\nwould be envious of,\nsetting up the maul for the\nman himself to score yet\nanother try this season.\nThe boys were now\nwithin a try of a bonus\npoint and even though\nthere was plenty of time on\nthe clock, IC kept the foot\non the gas after the restart.\nUnfortunately, after two\ntries were questionably\ndisallowed, Hertfordshire\nmanaged to get off their\nline. After many midfield\nset pieces IC managed to\nget into the Hertfordshire\n22 by stealing a lineout.\nMany hard carries led\nto Bolu getting over the\ntry line but unfortunately\nthe referee once again\ndisallowed the try. As the\nold saying goes, the ball\ndoesn\u2019t lie, and IC scored\noff the scrum after some\nweak defending by the\nHertfordshire centres.\nNow the bonus point\nwas sealed the boys could\nrelax and play their own\ngame as they continued to\ndominate Hertfordshire.\nSome absurdly filthy\nchampagne rugby saw\nIC go eighty metres to\nscore a wonderful try but\nonce again the ref controversially disallowed\nit for a forward pass.\nImperial still managed to\nbag another try though as\nthe IC pack outmuscled\nHertfordshire for Toby\nDaniels to get himself a\nsecond try of the match.\nThe game concluded\nwith Hertfordshire\nscoring a consolation try\nafter a long time on the\nIC try line.

Onboard\nthe spacecraft is an\ninstrument developed by\nscientists and engineers\nin Imperial\u2019s Space and\nAtmospheric Physics\ngroup, part of the Department of Physics.\nThe 1800-kilogram\nspacecraft will fly within\n42 million kilometres\nof the Sun, inside the\norbit of Mercury. Via\nmultiple gravity assists\naround Venus it will rise\nout of the ecliptic plane,\nrelaying the first images\nof the Sun\u2019s poles. The\nImperial-built magneto-meter will provide in-situ\nmeasurements of the\nSun\u2019s complex magnetic\nfield as it is carried out\ninto interplanetary space\nby the solar wind \u2013 a constant stream of charged\nparticles blowing off the\nSun. Solar Orbiter will\ncompliment and work\nin tandem with NASA\u2019s\nParker Solar Probe,\nlaunched in August 2018.\nThe magnetometer is\none of ten instruments\nonboard the spacecraft.\nSolar Orbiter is notable\nas an ESA mission with\nsignificant UK contribu-tion; as well as Imperial\u2019s\ninstrument, it also carries\na Solar Wind Plasma\nAnalyser built by the\nMullard Space Science\nLaboratory at UCL, and\nthe spacecraft itself was\nassembled by Airbus\nDefence and Space in\nStevenage.\nLaunching from Cape\nCanaveral, Florida, on\na NASA Atlas V 411\nrocket, the launch window\nis scheduled to open on\nFebruary 8th, 4:15am\nGMT. The possible launch\nwindow lasts three weeks,\nfor two hours per day.\nThese are the times when\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation and\nposition relative to Venus\nallow the rocket to follow\nthe required trajectory.\nExactly when within the\nwindow it blasts off is\nuncertain - delays to the\nlaunch are common and\ncan occur due to adverse\nweather conditions or\nminor technical issues.\nUnderstanding the\nsolar wind is important\nfor forecasting space\nweather. This is the set of\nphenomena experienced\nas the solar wind impacts\nand interacts with Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field. It is\nresponsible for the formation of the aurora, but in\nextreme events can also\ncause mass power grid\nfailures and disable GPS\nnetworks.

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20\nMarshall Mathers\u2019 Murder Music Makes A Mark\nDespite his legacy as one of hip hop\u2019s greats, Eminem has had a turbulent few years attempting to find his place\nin the culture\u2019s modern day. A somewhat reimagined Slim Shady on this new effort sounds like a step in the right\ndirection\n\u201c\nThe giant\u2019s woke,\neyes open, undeniable\u201d - and it seems\nthat he is here to stay.\nThis is the second time\nthat Eminem has surprised\nus with an unannounced\nalbum in the past 2 years.\nMusic To Be Murdered By\nis truly a unique addition\nin the Eminem discog-raphy, inspired by and\nfeaturing cuts from Alfred\nHitchcock\u2019s homonymous\nalbum released in 1958.\nEvidently benefiting from\nDr. Dre\u2019s involvement,\nthe album is musically\nsuperior to its predecessor Kamikaze, but it has\nalso allowed time for the\nrapper to develop a return\nof his Slim Shady alter\nego. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nthis album is not on\nthe same level as The\nMarshall Mathers LP - in\nfact nothing ever will be\n- but Slim is truly back,\nalbeit in slightly more\nmature form.\nTracks \u2018Premonition\u2019\nand \u2018Unaccommodating\u2019\nat the beginning of the\nalbum seem to pick up\nfrom the aftermath of\nKamikaze, referencing\nbad reviews from critics,\nhis 2017 effort Revival\nand of course the most\nrecent in his beef with\nMachine Gun Kelly.\nHowever, this is a new,\nmore self-aware Shady\nwho realises that he might\nhave misplaced his anger\nin his previous album.\n\u201cI could keep beefin\u2019,\nfuck is the point?\u201d, Em\npoints out on the track\n\u2018Marsh\u2019. Clearly, he is\nconfused with his position\nin the current rap game,\nespecially evident on \u2018No\nRegrets\u2019 where contrary\nto the title of the track, he\nadmits that his Tyler, the\nCreator diss on his last\nalbum was indeed wrong.\nHate and anger have\nbeen the lifeblood of\nEminem\u2019s early career\nand some of his best work\nhas indeed stemmed out\nof his childhood issues.\nEven at 47, Slim is clearly\nstill angry (or rather has\nforgotten how not be).\nBut tracks like \u2018Stepdad\u2019 ,\n\u2018Yah Yah\u2019 , \u2018Little Engine\u2019\nand \u2018Those Kinda Nights\u2019\nbenefit from this nihilistic\nrage and bring back\nthe graphic, gruesome\nimagery of his early\n2000\u2019s style coupled with\nold school beats and a\ndrug-infused atmosphere\nreminiscent of The Slim\nShady LP. In the latter, Em\nadmits being taken back to\nhis D12 days by the beat,\nwhich would have been\nentirely true for me as a\nlistener had it not been\nfor Ed Sheeran\u2019s feature\non the chorus, which\ncomes across as out of\nplace against the reckless,\ndrugged-out party action\nbackdrop. In fact, a few\nof the choruses on this\nproject sound like rushed,\noverboard attempts at\ncatchiness with rock and\nacoustic touches.\nNevertheless, Em\u2019s\nvoice, lyrical skill and\nrawness in combination\nwith very fitting features\nincluding the late Juice\nWRLD on \u2018Godzilla\u2019 and\nEm\u2019s long-time friend\nRoyce da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019 on \u2018Yah\nYah\u2019 , \u2018I Will\u2019 and of\ncourse the stand out \u2018You\nGon\u2019 Learn\u2019 make up\nfor these flaws. To me,\n\u2018Godzilla\u2019 is a statement\nor rather a reminder that\nEminem is one of the\nbest to ever do it, with the\nrapper breaking his own\nrecord (see \u2018Rap God\u2019)\nof the fastest rap verse,\nspitting a staggering 10.65\nsyllables per second on\nthe track\u2019s third verse.\nOn \u2018In Too Deep\u2019,\n\u2018Never Love Again\u2019 and\n\u2018Farewell\u2019, Eminem\nseems to dwell once more\non the multitude of failed\nromantic relationships that\nhe\u2019s had in the past, the\nprime example being his\ndysfunctional, co-depend-ed marriage with ex-wife\nKim Scott. Eminem also\naddresses the loss of his\nfather \u2013 who died recently\nat the age of 67 \u2013 for the\nfirst time on the track\n\u2018Leaving Heaven\u2019. Just\nlike on \u2018Cleanin\u2019 Out\nMy Closet\u2019 17 years ago,\nEm\u2019s resentment towards\nhim is made entirely clear.\nOn the track, he holds his\nfather responsible for his\nproblematic childhood\nbut also thanks him for\nnot being there for him\nbecause it led to his\nindustry success. Despite\nlines like \u201cI hate that I\u2019ll\nnever get to say \u201cI hate\nyou\u201d to your face\u201d, the\ntrack feels like Eminem\u2019s\nown twisted way of saying\ngoodbye to his father and\nperhaps letting go of some\nof that anger.\n\u2018Darkness\u2019 is truly\nwhere the album shines\n- chilling, alarming and\ngoose-bump inducing. In\nthis track, Em describes\nthe last moments before\nthe 2017 mass shooting\nat the Las Vegas Route\n91 Harvest music festival\nfrom the eyes of the\nshooter, attempting to\nunravel the thoughts of\nthe shooter. He includes\ndetails such as concern\nthat the festival will be\nunderattended and that\nmass shootings are such\na common occurrence\nnow that the massacre\nmight not attract as much\nsuch sensitive subjects in\na unique and compelling\nway.\nOverall, this album\nis something special\n\u2013 hearing Slim Shady\ntrying to re-establish\nhimself in the current era\nis intriguing to say the\nleast. Although it cannot\nbe compared to Em\u2019s\nfirst couple of LPs, the\nproject is far from a failed\nattempt at bringing back\nhis hedonistic, horrorcore\npersona, rather a rebirth\nand maturing of it. If you\nhave listened to the album\nand felt disappointed, I\nhope that this review will\nmake you at least give it\na second chance. To quote\nHitchcock\u2019s outro to the\nalbum, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t\nbeen murdered, I can only\nsay. Better luck next time.\nIf you have been, goodnight wherever you are.\u201d\nHalloween in January - why not // Shady Records\nMUSIC\nPanayiotis Salatas\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Eminem.

Top Tracks:\nMarsh; Darkness; Godzilla.\nFor Fans Of: Tech N9ne;\nJoyner Lucas. 64 minutes\nMUSIC TO BE\nMURDERED BY\n\u201cThe album\nis musically\nsuperior to its\npredecessor\nKamikaze,\nbut it has also\nallowed time\nfor the rapper\nto develop a\nreturn of his\nSlim Shady\nalter ego\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Darkness\u2019is\ntruly where the\nalbum shines\n- chilling,\nalarming and\ngoose-bump\ninducing\u201d\nattention as he\u2019d like. I\u2019m\nnot sure of Eminem\u2019s\nexact intention with this\ntrack, but for me it is a\nreminder that amongst\nthe controversy that has\nalways shrouded his\nname, the rapper can be\na potent force to address\nand raise awareness about\n\n"

I\u2019m\ninstantly blasted back by\nsoaring sounds emerging\nfrom the stage to my right\nand as I scuttle away, I realise it\u2019s them. It\u2019s Uncle\nMonty.\nAs the noise dies down,\nI crave for more and with\nmy second realisation\nsince stepping inside, I\nnotice they are still sound\nchecking. Thankfully, I\nhaven\u2019t missed a thing.\nA few technical hiccups\nlater and this time the\nband are on for good.\nSinger/guitarist Harvey\nMontague launches into \u2018I\nFucking H8 U (But I Need\nYour Love)\u2019, somehow\ncrooning and spitting out\nthe lyrics to convey a love-filled rage with a twinge\nof hurt. It\u2019s straight-up\nindie, with subtle folk\nand jazz undertones and\nmaybe even a hint of The\nBeatles in guitarist Yanis\nMzari\u2019s solo towards\nthe end. This oozes into\nthe next song, \u2018Stan the\nMan\u2019, where Felix\u2019s own\nMiles Gulliford mimics\nthe rhythm in the title\nwith his infectious bass\nline which creeps its way\ninto this dreamy indie-pop\nsong. Drummer Amber\nDylan is the star of this\nsong though, providing a\ngreat beat even as Uncle\nMonty slip into their\nnext song \u2018Off with Their\nHeads\u2019. Montague guides\nus through his climactic\nchorus with an acoustic\nriff Johnny Cash would be\njealous of, whilst the rest\nof the band groove along\nin sync.\nUp next is the bluesy\n\u2018King of Everything\u2019\nfollowed by \u2018Poplar\nTree\u2019, a melancholic\nindie-pop hit which showcases Montague\u2019s lyrical\nabilities: \u201cIf it were up\nto me//I\u2019d suffocate and\nmasturbate\u201d. \u2018Poplar Tree\u2019\nalso hinted at a slinky,\nbluesy pop noise while incorporating a singer-song-writer element, with this\nall eventually reaching a\ncrescendo complete with\nswooning guitar from\nMzari, crashing drums\nand a bassline that held it\nall together, with the result\ntaking your breath away.\nUncle Monty followed\nthis up with \u2018I Took a\nPill\u2019, where Montague,\nsounding like Dan\nAuerbach of The Black\nKeys, softly lulled us in\nbefore Dylan crashed us\nback down to the ground\nwith a hard-hitting chorus\nnot unlike the in-your-face\nstyle of The Smashing\nPumpkins. Rounding the\nset off came \u2018Bulldog\nPuppy Love\u2019, reminiscent\nof Pete and the Pirates\nand accompanied by a\ncatchy chorus that stayed\nwith me long after I left\nClapham behind. My\nfinal thoughts, as the bus\nwhisked me away, were\nthose of advice: if you\u2019re\nanywhere near South\nLondon, you should definitely keep an eye out for\nUncle Monty.\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Editor\nbeat compilations are so\nuniform in texture and\nstyle that it essentially\nboils down to being\nelevator music; its sole\npurpose is to fill a void\nand not be noticed. At\nleast in context elevator\nmusic makes sense: you\nonly listen to it for a\nbrief period of time and it\nmakes what can be an uncomfortable space a little\nmore calming. Repetitive\nand predictable are not\nqualities you should\nlook for in study music.\nBreaking concentration\nfrom your work only to\nbe greeted by the drowsy,\nsedated sounds of lo-fi\nbeats just leaves you tired\nand apathetic. White\nnoise - literally defined as\nlacking pattern or rhythm\n- is more engaging, and\nas an added bonus it has\nanti-anxiety effects. I\u2019d\nmuch rather listen to\nSounds of Nature Relaxation for hours on end (real\nartist on Spotify, highly\nrecommend).\nThere are so many new\nand genuinely interesting\nthings to listen to out\nthere, but with lo-fi beats\nit\u2019s the same goddamn\nthing every time. When\nwas the last time you heard\nsomeone raving about a\nLo-Fi artist? 99.9% of\nyou just answered \u201cnever\u201d\nbecause nobody can even\nname more than one.\nWhen I sit down to study\nthere are a myriad of\ndifferent worlds I can end\nup inhabiting. From the\ndesert landscapes painted\nby psychedelic funk to\nthe neon-lit utopias of\nsynth wave, my childhood\ndreamworlds of studio\nGhibli soundtracks to\nthe infectious beats of\nalternative electronic.\nYes, I\u2019m aware I sound\nlike a pretentious dick describing the music I study\nto like this, but I only do\nit because I have genuine\naffection for it.\nI suppose the crux\nof my hatred for lo-fi\nbeats is that every piece\nof recorded music in all\nof history only a click\naway, so then why would\nI choose to listen to the\nmost tedious, banal, and\nuninspired music of our\ngeneration?\nMost people I know\nthankfully choose not to\nIf lo-fi beats are so good then why does she always look bored? // jpmachado.art\npoison their brains with\nlo-fi beats.

Then\nyou\u2019ll love Happily\nEver Poofter, the\nsmash hit Disney musical\nparody!\u201d is the tagline\nthe creators of the show\ndecided to go with and\nas a frequent consumer\nof both, how could I not\nattend this show? I\u2019m\nhappy to report that not\nonly did it deliver on its\npremise, it did so with\nfabulous style, cutting\nwit, and a huge amount of\nheart.\nSet predictably far,\nfar away, the one-man\nshow follows Prince\nHenry (Rich Watkins),\nself-professed \u201conly gay\nin the kingdom\u201d. In an\neffort to find his commu-nity, his fairy godmother\nwishes him away to a\nland much closer to our\nown - London\u2019s gay\nscene. Plunging head (or\narse) first into the realities of modern-day gay\nrelationships, he must find\nhis true love, expose his\ntruth back at home, and\ngain acceptance from a\ndeeply heterosexual world\nin order to have his own\nhappily ever after.\nWith a production value\nprobably amounting to\nlittle more than a night out\nin London, the show could\nhave suffered but the incredibly lo-fi set coupled\nwith campy costume\nchoices only focused\naudience attention on the\nstar of the show. And what\na star! Dancing, singing,\nand\u2026 puppeteering his\nway through the whole\nproduction, Watkins never\nlet the energy in the room\ndip, forging through with\nsweat-fuelled vigour.\nEven the audience\nparticipation with its\npanto-esque feel was kept\nwell-balanced and well-spaced throughout the\nshow, preventing it from\nfalling into pure farce. As\na testament to his skill in\nhandling the audience,\none scene involving an\nunwilling (and tragically\nbland) audience member\nwas kept lively and\nhumorous thanks to some\nquick thinking and plenty\nof sass.\nThe song covers, a\nselection of Disney\u2019s\ngreatest hits, were bawdy,\ninnuendo-laden affairs.\nSome songs such as \u2018I\u2019ve\nJust Come Out to the\nKing\u2019 were a stroke of\ngenius and in this particular case, sung far better\nthan the child-Simba currently gracing the Lyceum\nstage in West End\u2019s own\nLion King. Other songs\nsuch as \u2018Part of that\nScene\u2019, while funny, may\nlack some context into the\noriginal work. Howard\nAshman, the original\nlyricist, was a gay man\nliving in the height of the\nAIDS epidemic in the US\nand finally succumbed to\nthe disease merely two\nyears after The Little\nMermaid\u2019s release. There\nis no doubt in my mind\nthat when Ariel sings of\nher desire to belong in the\nhuman world, it echoed\nAshman\u2019s own feelings\nof alienation in our real\nworld. To parody the song\nin this particular way was\neither a tremendous act\nof subversion or a slight\nmisstep for the show.\nSimilarly, I didn\u2019t feel\nthat \u2018Let It Go\u2019, a song\nalready championed as\na gay anthem, needed to\nbe parodied to make the\nsame point as the original\nsong.\nOne could argue over\nthe finer points of the\nshow such as its focus\non the gay sex scene as a\nrepresentation of a whole\nLGBTQ+ community, but\nas a piece of fun, family\n-friendly entertainment,\nit hit all the right notes in\nexpressing the importance\nof explicit representation\nand acceptance.\nWhat Will it Take to Break You Out of Racial Ignorance?\nT\nhe Glass Will\nShatter. There\nis no choice,\nbut it simply\nwill, Eventually. This\nthought-provoking play\nforces you to confront and\nacknowledge the different\nnarratives which surround\neveryday racism, and no\nlonger view the issue from\na distance, protected by a\npane of glass. This small,\n3-woman cast combined\nwith well-timed and\nimpressive light work,\nkept the audience steadily\nengaged throughout, and\nnever gave you a chance\nto get too comfortable\nbefore suddenly changing\nthe tone of the scene.\nThe opening scene\nsets the mood for the rest\nof the play with its use of\nsymbolism to depict the\ntraumatic dreams which\nthe main character, Rebecca (Josephine Arden),\nis still experiencing. She\ndreams vividly about\nwhat happened in her\nclassroom almost 10 years\nago with a troublesome\nstudent, Amina (Naima\nSwaleh). We engage with\nRebecca\u2019s character and\nsympathise with the kind\nof struggles which she\nmust have been through\nafter the event, but soon\nwe step past the glass and\nwatch the scenario objec-tively. We retrospectively\nsee how Rebecca struggles as a white teacher to\nrelate to and understand\nissues of faith and culture\nbetween her, Amina, and\nher fellow teaching col-league, the latter two of\nwhich are Somali.\nThe characters swiftly move the set around\nto switch us from scene\nto scene, and as the pace\nof the play speeds up, the\naudience\u2019s attention is\nin the palm of the actors.\nWe slowly understand\nhow the racial microag-gressions and ignorance\ndisplayed by Rebecca escalated the issue at hand\nand led to her causing\nmore harm than good.\nThe play tastefully educates us about how the\nPrevent Policy affects the\ndynamic between teacher\nand student, and how it\ncan further exacerbate issues to do with race. After a very tense build up\nto what really happened\nin the classroom 8 years\nago, we\u2019re snapped back\nto present day to view\nRebecca\u2019s narrative in a\ndifferent light and see her\nfalse sense of victimhood\nbeing used as a defense\nmechanism to avoid confronting the consequences\nof her actions.\nThe tone, pace, and\nstyle of the play were\nbrilliantly designed and\npieced together to help\nus question ourselves and\nview social issues in a different light, without being\npatronising or preachy.\nThe show was fully cap-tioned, which was stylistically thought-out with\nthe fonts for each character symbolising their\npersonality, rather than\njust a shabby attempt at\nmaking the show more\naccessible and not actually integrating the captions\ninto the storyline. Overall,\nthis was an amazing piece\nwhich will urge you to rethink social constructs and\nfacades, as it is inevitable\nthat the glass will shatter.\nISSUE 1741\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "Interview with Julianna Russell, Designer\nTo get an understanding of the people behind the fashion at this year\u2019s Charity Fashion Show, we spoke with the\ndesigners, models, and organisers...\nFASHION\nJohn James Humm\nFashion Writer\nCan you briefly introduce yourself and\nyour brand?\nHello! I\u2019m Juliana,\nowner and creator of\nJuliana Russell Designs.\nOriginally from Boston,\nI studied abroad here at\nthe London College of\nFashion in 2018, which\nmade me absolutely fall\nin love with the city of\nLondon and all of the\npeople, fashion, culture\nand art that comes with it.\nI loved it so much I made\nit my mission to work here\nafter graduating \u2013 and I\ncouldn\u2019t be happier with\nthat decision (hello five\nyear visa!). My designs\nare one of a kind, made\nto stand out in whatever\ncrowd you\u2019re in.\nWhere does your inspiration come from\nand what is your\nbrands ethos?\nFor my collection\nSensory Stimulation,\nmy inspirations come\nfrom a number of things,\none being expressing\ntexture through different\nfabrics and techniques,\nand how these factors\ncan affect the way you\nlook, feel and think about\nclothes. My obsession\nfor unicorns and their\nmagical presence has also\ndefinitely inspired many\naspects for this collection,\nas you will soon see, this\ncollection is like entering\na dreamy, magical world\nfilled with bright colours\nand sparkles.\nHow does London\nand its culture influence you?\nLondon\u2019s crazy fashion\nand quirky art had a huge\nimpact on my designs.\nNobody is afraid to stand\nout here, everyone likes\nexpressing themselves\nin unique and fun ways.\nThis city truly pushes my\ncreative boundaries and\nI\u2019m not afraid to branch\nout from the norm when it\ncomes to my designs.\nHow do you feel your\ndesigns connect to a\nstudent population?\nAs I finished my degree\nin Boston only a few\nyears ago, I completely\nunderstand the grind that\nwe as designers, especially student designers,\ngo through. The sleepless\nnights of sewing and seam\nripping, and the criticism\nof others who just don\u2019t\nunderstand how much\ntime and hard work goes\ninto creating something\nthat truly makes you\nhappy. What I can tell you\nis that the countless hours\nin the studio are completely worth it, so don\u2019t give\nup, you\u2019ll be outshining\nthe haters soon enough.\nWhy did you decide\nto participate in the\nImperial College\n2020 Fashion Show?\nThe fact that the show\nis a charity event for ClientEarth was an automatic\nyes for me. As I have an\nupcoming collection for\n2021 in the making, I\nwanted to present Sensory\nStimulation one final time,\nand why not end it with a\non a high note?\nThe fashion show\u2019s\ntheme and format\nthis year takes the\nform of\u201c1980s Vs.\n2000s\u201d. How do you\nfeel about the styles\nand fashion in these\ndecades and is it\nreflected in your de-signs?\nGlitter, glitz, glam.\nThese decades shaped\nthe way for a new era of\nfashion, and we\u2019re 100%\nstill seeing these trends\nreturn on today\u2019s runways.\nBesides being extra and\nsparkly, I also brought the\nbell-bottomed trousers\nback with a special twist.\nWhich\u2018fashion icons\u2019\nfrom the 1980s or the\n2000s do you wish\nyou could see in your\ngarments?\nWhitney Houston,\nLeigh Bowery, Madonna,\nMichael Jackson, Abba,\nand Christina Aguilera\nto name some. I could\ndefinitely see them performing in my stuff.\nLooking forward to\nthe 2020s, where do\nyou see your career\ngoing?\nWith my new collection\nin the pre-development\nstages, I\u2019m excited to\nlaunch it by 2021, following with runway shows\nand editorial photoshoots.\nHowever, this collection\nwill be with a different\ntwist from what you\u2019re\nseeing at this year\u2019s show.\nDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll still\nbe a lot of glitz and glam,\njust in a more sophisticated way with a different\ncolour scheme. I hope to\njoin a brand in the near\nfuture with like-minded\nstyle and ethos so I can\ncontribute to their team\u2019s\ndesigns and create some\nreally innovative content.\nOur charity this year\nis ClientEarth, Europe\u2019s pioneering\nenvironmental law\ncharity which helps\nto minimise the\nimpacts of climate\nchange. Is this an issue that you\u2019ve been\nmindful of in your\nwork?\nThere are a few techniques and fabrics in my\ncollection Sensory Stimulation that are reused from\nmy previous fabric stock\nthat I\u2019ve collected over\nthe years. However, my\nupcoming collection for\n2021 will be much more\nsustainable with minimal\nfabric waste in mind, as I\nhave grown over the past\nfew years and I want to\nbecome better and design\nsmarter when it comes to\nreusing textiles and giving\nthem a new life.Work with\nwhat you have! In fact,\nmy finale piece this show\nwas created entirely out of\nfabric swatches from my\noffice\u2019s fabric library that\nwe were getting rid of.\nWhat are your\nthoughts and feelings on the current\nrelationship between\nthe fashion industry\nand the environ-ment?\nI\u2019m so glad that over\nthe past few years the\nfashion industry has really\naccepted the damage\nwe\u2019ve done to the Earth.\nWe\u2019ve addressed that we\nare one of the most polluting industries, but thankfully SO many brands are\nnow on board with ethical\nsourcing, sustainable pro-duction, and the circular\neconomy of a garment.\nWe are aware of the\nissues, and we are trying\nto become better, which\nis a start. Some people see\nsustainability as a \u201ctrend\u201d,\nbut it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a new way\nof living. I believe it will\ncontinue to grow even\nlarger over time, expanding to all industries over\nthe world, becoming an\nabsolute standard for all\nbusinesses.\nWhere can our readers find you on social\nmedia and buy your\ngarments from? If\nyou are sold in any\nphysical retail locations in London, tell\nus where!\nI\u2019m on all social\nmedia platforms as @\njulianarusselldesigns, so\nplease feel free to contact\nme if you\u2019re interested in\npurchasing any of my one\nof a kind pieces or want\nto collab. You can check\nout my website with all\nof my previous work and\nrunway shows too!\nShowcasing sensory stimulation in her newest collection// @julianarusseldesigns\nFASHION\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020 FELIX\n18\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1741\nFELIX\n9\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIndia\u2019s economic\npotential\nDespite the horrors of\nBritish colonialism, India\ndid gain a few advantages\nbecause of this. Firstly,\nit is the world\u2019s largest\ndemocracy. Secondly, it\nis the second largest English-speaking nation in\nthe world after the United\nStates. With English being\nthe primary language of\ninternational business,\nthis is very advantageous.\nAdditionally, India was\nleft with a British style\nlegal system, despite the\npresence of corruption.\nOverall, on paper, the\nIndian legal system can be\nseen as very similar to that\nof a western democracy.\nThis means that the core\nlegal framework of the\nIndian judicial system is\nfair. This is something\nthat is very attractive to a\ncompany when deciding\nwhether to set up operations in a country. It\ncan also be seen in the\nWJP Open Government\nIndex where India ranks\n37th\nglobally whereas\nits primary competitor,\nChina, ranks at 87th\nworld-wide. In addition to this\ntherearestrictlawsagainst\nintellectual property\ntheft, which encourages\nbusiness con\ufb01dence when\ndeciding to start business\nin a new country. Also,\ndue to more extreme\nprotectionist policies\nand abrupt actions by\nthe Chinese government,\nmany businesses have\nlooked for other locations\nto relocate their manufacturing hubs. For example,\nSamsung has moved all of\nits smartphone production\nfrom China to India and\nVietnam, and Apple has\nalso begun manufacturing\nphones in India. India has\nthe potential to become a\nglobal manufacturing hub\nfor low- and medium-end mass-produced\nproducts because of its\nlarge young population.\nLimitations to India\nachieving its\neconomic potential\nThough India may have\ngreat potential, there are\nmany limitations that can\nhinder Indian growth.\nSince the Bharatiya\nJanata Party (BJP), led\nby Narendra Modi, took\npower in 2014 thanks to\npromises that India would\nbecome a global power-house, Modi has been a\npolarising \ufb01gure. He has\nhad some successes such\nas increasing the ease with\nwhich companies can\noperate within the country.\nIndia rose in the ease of\ndoing business index from\n132nd\nwhen he took power\nto 63rd\nglobally. Many of\nthe country\u2019s bureaucratic\npolicies and red tape\nregulations were also\nremoved. In addition to\nthis, since he took power\nmore Indians have begun\nto use bank accounts and\ncashless payments, which\nhas lowered corruption\nin welfare payments as\ncitizens are directly paid\nwithout possibility of\ncorrupt of\ufb01cials retaining\nowed cash. However,\ndespite these smaller suc-cesses, many large social\nand economic issues have\narisen during Modi\u2019s\npremiership. The largest\nmistake being the 2016\ndemonetisation crisis.\nFailed economic\npolicies\nIn 2016, in a sudden\nsurprise move to destroy\nthe shadow economy\nand the amount of \u201cblack\nmoney\u201d in the country,\nModi\u2019s government announced that all 500 and\n1000 rupee notes would\nbe rendered worthless and\nthatallcitizenswouldhave\nto go to banks to exchange\nthese notes for new 500\nand 2000 rupee notes.\nWhile the move had good\nintentions to catch those\nwho had black money, the\npolicy was a huge failure,\nwith cash shortages being\npresent throughout the\ncountry and businesses\nnot being able to run due\nto this liquidity crisis.\nThus, the effort to curtail\nthe shadow economy also\nfailed as over 99% of the\nold notes were submitted,\nwhich suggests that those\nhandling illegal money\nmanaged to convert it\ninto the new notes. Due\nto this move, the Indian\neconomy slowed down by\nseveral percentage points\nand many jobs were lost.\nAnother major failure\nwas the introduction of a\ntax on foreign investors\nthat would see them\nbeing taxed 40% to do\nbusiness in India, despite\nIndia having one of the\nhighest import tariffs in\nthe world among major\neconomies. This heavily\nback\ufb01red and caused the\nworst Indian stock market\nperformance in 17 years.\nThe tax was retracted\nfrom law within a month\nbecause of the potential\nloss in foreign investment\nthat could occur. Furthermore, a General Sales\nTax was introduced to\nmake all the states within\nIndia essentially a single\nmarket and allowing interstate trade to be easier.\nHowever, as with demon-etisation, this policy was\nheavily criticised for the\nmethod via which it was\nimplemented. Because of\nthis tax, many small businesses shut down or were\nput into \ufb01nancial dif\ufb01culties. Despite these huge\nblunders by the Indian\nGovernment, Modi\u2019s BJP\nwon a landslide general\nelection in 2019 \u2013 primarily attributed to a weak\nopposition and a huge\nmisinformation propaganda campaign carried out\nby \u201cIT cells\u201d, indirectly\ncontrolled by the BJP\u2019s\nPublic Relations arm.\nDivisive social\npolicies\nSince Modi\u2019s election,\nsectarian violence has\nbeen on the rise and extremist Hindu nationalism\nhas also risen. This can be\nseen by the lynching of\nMuslims for consuming\nbeef \u2013 a sacred animal\nin Hinduism \u2013 in the\nnorthern Hindi belt states.\nOther radical policies\noccurring because of\nModi\u2019s government is the\nnearly 6-month internet\nshutdown in the union\nterritories of Ladakh\nand Jammu & Kashmir\nbecause of anti-govern-ment protests. More social\nunrest has occurred with\nprotests across India due\nto the introduction of the\nCitizenship Amendment\nAct (CAA), which is a\nlaw introduced by the BJP\nthat allows non-Muslim\nrefugees from neighbouring countries in Asia to\nbe given refuge and an\nexpress pathway to citizenship in India. However,\nmany believed this to be\nagainst the Indian consti-tution, which implies that\nIndia is a secular country\nwith freedom of religion.\nThus, this act violated the\n(cont. on next page)\nThe number of people in poverty in India, 2005/6 and 2016/7 // Forbes, Statista\nIndia protests the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act // The New Yorker\n\u201cIndia ranks\n37th\nglobally in\nthe WIP Open\nGovernment\nIndex, whereas\nits primary\ncompetitor,\nChina,\nranks at 87th\nworldwide\u201d\n\n"

Going\nby several monikers and\naliases, by far his most\ninfluential and prolific\npersonality is that of King\nKrule.\nArchy Ivan Marshall.\nHe grew up in Southwark,\nmoving between Peckham\nand East Dulwich, and\ndespite struggles with\nmental health during his\nchildhood he has been\nmoulded into a young man\nwith seemingly endless\ncreativity and potential.\nWhen digging into this\nillusive figure\u2019s history\nyou could be forgiven in\nthinking all the different\nnames where those of\nindividual musicians\n\u2013 but mistaken. Albeit\nslightly unorthodox\nnames \u2013 examples include\nThe Return of the Pimp\nShrimp, Zoo Kid, DJ JD\nSports, and variations\nof Edgar the Beatmaker \u2013 each one has its\nown unique sound with\nuncompromising depth.\nThese monikers have their\nown fascinating origins\nand give you a brief\nglimpse into the mind of\na prodigy. For example,\nKing Krule was formulated on Elvis Presley\u2019s film\n\u2018King Creole\u2019. Notable\nsimilarities between the\ntwo is that both Danny\nFisher (Elvis) and Archy\ndropped out of school and\npossess musical talent.\nThe story of \u2018King Creole\u2019\nis also intertwined with\nthe immature romance\nbetween Danny and\nNellie which eventually\nblossoms at the end of\nthe film; the same theme\nis littered throughout\nArchy\u2019s music, that of disappointment and regret.\n\u201cMarshall\nhas a knack\nfor plucking\nheart strings,\ndrenching his\nworks with\nemotion such\nthat it seeps\nfrom the\nedges\u201d\nAround 2010, Archy\nstarted producing music\nas Zoo Kid with his longtime friend and fellow\nBrit School student Jamie\nIsaac. But in 2013, King\nKrule reared his head with\n6 Feet Beneath the Moon\n\u2013 a critically acclaimed\ndebut album which turned\nheads and drew ears. This\nwas and still is my older\nbrother\u2019s favourite album\nof all time.\nDepression is a topic\nthat Archy covers often,\nperhaps related to his\nchildhood mental health\nproblems, discussed in\nan interview with The\nGuardian in 2013. For\nthose who similarly struggled with anxiety, their\nemotions, and identity\nthe music of King Krule\nprovided a sympathetic\ntouch.\nMarshall has a knack\nfor plucking heart strings,\ndrenching his works\nwith emotion such that\nit seeps from the edges.\nHis music is not bound by\ngenre instead drawing on\nthe best aspects of each,\nhowever rock (\u201cAlternative\u201d as stated by iTunes)\nwould always be his\nmost intimate stage. This\noriginality is exemplified\nin Archy\u2019s 2015 A New\nPlace 2 Drown which was\npart of a larger project\nwith his brother, Jack. The\nproject included a vivid\nand touching mini documentary of their lives,\nfriends, and mother. It\ngave his audience a chance\nto see the real King Krule.\nGoing back to the music,\nthis album was much\ndarker and more sinister\nthan previous works\npossibly mirroring how\nArchy felt during the time.\nChasing a slightly digital\nfeel, he made most of the\nalbum using a simple beat\nlooper and a laptop. Not to\ndetract from the music, it\nwas unique, one of a kind,\nveering from the trodden\npath and venturing into an\nunknown which he pulled\noff perfectly. This was and\nstill is my favourite album\nof all time although this\npodium has been perilously close to changing\nhands; I still listen to the\nentire album from start to\none of his most polished\nand deeply moving LPs\nto date. Pitchfork named\nit the best rock album of\n2017. If you don\u2019t know\nwhat album I\u2019m talking\nabout then you\u2019ve been\nliving under a rock. The\nOoz is in my top 5 albums\nof all time and rightly so.\n17 tracks, each crafted\nwith meticulous care,\nwith a different narrative,\nwith the same message:\nvexed. In an interview\nshortly before releasing\nhis second album under\nKing Krule, he talked\nabout \u201c\u2026 the gunk\u201d and\nhow it was invading his\nsubconscious, leeching\nhis creativity, but ended\nup giving him the inspiration for the album.\nA short biography\nof this remarkable gin-ger-haired man would\nnot be complete without\nmentioning his relationship with Charlotte\nPatmore \u2013 photographer,\nfamous in her own right.\nThey welcomed their first\nbaby, Marina, on the 14th\nMarch 2019. Since then,\nthis power couple have\nbeen busy; raising a child\nand directing/filming\nwould not have been easy\nyet they made it happen. I\ncan\u2019t wait to see what they\ndo next.\nMan Alive! This is my\nofficial endorsement of\nan album that only has\none song released so far.\n2020 is going to be a big\nyear for Archy with his\nthird full-length studio\nalbum set to release on\nthe 21st February. If\nI\u2019m being honest with\nmyself, I expected an\nalbum after he released\nthe not-so cryptic \u2018Hey\nWorld!\u2019 video (directed\nby Charlotte Patmore),\ncontaining 4 new songs\nand 2020 tour dates. This\nmonologuing video premiered the song \u201c(Don\u2019t\nLet the Dragon) Draag\nOn\u201d which is available\nat the time of writing by\npre-ordering the album.\nSelf-directed music video\naccompanied, this new\ntrack is twisted in visuals\nand lyrics, showing Archy\nbeing burnt alive in the\nclosing seconds.

You\nhave probably seen the\nads and all those trending #Veganuary laden\nInstagram posts. Perhaps\nyou are a participant\nyourself. Since 2014, the\nVeganuary charity has\nbeen working with enterprises and individuals\nto achieve their goal of a\n\u201cvegan world\u201d. No surprise here, their flagship\nencourages people to\nadopt a plant-based diet\nfor the whole of January\nand then (ideally) for the\nrestoftheirlives,oratleast\nstop them from eating as\nmany animal-based foods.\nAs #Veganuary draws to\nan end, those who have\nparticipated would stay\nvegan, become \u2018flexitarian\u2019, try again next year\nor abandon veganism\naltogether. It makes one\nwonder, in the grand\nscheme of things, whether\nveganism is merely just\nanother passing trend or\nan undisputed, long-term\nshift in lifestyles.\nThe issue could lie\nwith the name of the\ncampaign. \u201cVeganuary\u201d\nimplies that a plant-based\ndiet is something casually\ntaken up once a year\nrather than the consistent\nway of life it champions\nfor. When paired with a\nhashtag, the connotations\nof momentariness are\neven stronger. (Like, is\nanyone still on about\n#covfefe or #kyliejen-nerlipchallenge?) We\u2019ve\nseen diet trends peak and\nfade as quickly as fashion\ntrends: low-carb, keto,\nWhole30... the list goes\non. But it appears that\nnone of them has had as\ncontroversial and as loud\nof an impact as veganism.\nIn comparison to those\nso-called \u201cfad diets\u201d, for\nmany the ultimate goal\nbehind adopting a vegan\ndiet are its wider social\nand ethical implications,\nrather than just the deeply\npersonal chase for the\nperfect body weight and\nshape. There\u2019s the altruistic ideal that comes along\nwith veganism: rejecting\nanimal cruelty, mitigating\nclimate change, alleviating resource depletion\u2026\nYou\u2019ve already heard the\nstory a thousand times.\nEven if you haven\u2019t, feel\nfree to search up #vegan\non social media and read\nthe comments.\nAs of now, perhaps\nthat\u2019s why veganism\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be\ndwindling any time soon,\nespecially in the UK.\nThere\u2019s no need to wait\nuntil January to see its\nprominence in everyday\nlife. A plethora of vegan\nfood alternatives is available commercially, from\nthe ubiquitous plant-based\nburgers to the array of\nnut and seed milks to the\nabundant dairy-free ice\ncreams.

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24\nThe Lighthouse (2019)\nWith a UK release on 31st January, Film has its take on the Academy Award nominated film that\u2019s had all the\ncritics talking.\nA\nfter the\ncritical and\nc o m m e r c i a l\nsuccess of The\nWitch, writer/director\nRobert Eggers presents\nhis second film The\nLighthouse, an intimate\npsychological horror. On\nan isolated island off the\ncoast of New England\nin the late 19th century,\nEphraim Winslow (Robert\nPattinson) arrives on a\nfour-week contract to\nwork for the old lighthouse keeper Thomas\nWake (Willem Dafoe). In\nsuch a desolate and harsh\nenvironment, paranoia\ncan get the better of men.\nImmediately, I appreciated the craftmanship that\nhas intricately welded the\nfilm together. This film\nlooks incredible. Opting\nto shoot in black and white\n35mm with a boxy aspect\nratio, the cinematography\nand the arresting visuals\nreminisces the period\nsetting. Versatile shifts\nfrom claustrophobic\nindoor scenes and expansive seascapes are\neffective despite the\nsquarish frame. The\nhandling of light is important in a film titled The\nLighthouse\u2014especially\nthe murky night scenes\nwhere characters\u2019 faces\nare perfectly captured\nbeautifully. Eggers impressively directs each\nshot for maximum impact\non the viewer.\nBased loosely on an\nunfinished Edgar Allen\nPoe short story, The Lighthouse emulates the feeling\nof reading poetry\u2014 a\nhaunting meditation on\nguilt dressed up as a\nhorror film. In essence,\nthe film is a descent into\nmadness, but disappointingly doesn\u2019t seem to\ndo much more than that.\nAfter sanity is given the\ndischarge notice, in enters\nthe bizarre; unlike the\nhigh contrast monochromatic look, the absurdist\ndevelopment of the plot\nare many shades of grey\nand it\u2019s up to us how we\ninterpret it. This can feel\nfrustrating and unsatisfying at times, but is never\n\u201cThe\nLighthouse\nemulates\nthe feeling\nof reading\npoetry\u2014 a\nhaunting\nmeditation on\nguilt dressed\nup as a horror\nfilm\u201d\n\u201cIf there were\na prize for eye-acting, Dafoe\nand Pattinson\nwould be\nequally worthy\nof the award\u201d\nboring to watch; moments\nof intermittent humour\nare well balanced and\nprovide humanity to the\ncharacters. The film has a\nbeautiful fairy-tale lilt; superstitions about seagulls\nbeing the souls of sailors,\ntraumatic dreams steeped\nin shame and foreshadowing curses. This tone\nis complemented by the\nabstract mystical visuals,\nthat is best left to wash\nover you.\nThe brooding score is\nnuanced, often blending\ninto the omnipresent\nfoghorn in the back-ground. It creeps along\nwith the story, providing\nan ambient backdrop\nbut takes centre stage\nin climactic moments\neffectively. The sound\ndesign is particularly\nimpressive too, with\ndeafening and oppressive\nsoundscapes that grab you\nby the throat, and strange\nchilling distortion effects\nthat complement the grotesque visuals.\nAs for the performanc-es, they are great and\nsurprisingly understated.\nBoth Dafoe and Pattinson exude confidence\nas performers working\nwith such unconventional\nmaterial, fully fleshing\nout the characters. Eggers\ngives them individual\nopportunities to shine;\nDafoe and Pattinson are at\nthe top of their game , but\nthey don\u2019t appear to be\nthe pretentious Oscar-bait\ntype of performances,\nwhich is why they didn\u2019t\nget the recognition they\ndeserved. If there were\na prize for eye-acting,\nchilling moments and\nvisceral imagery but it\ndidn\u2019t get under my skin.\nOn a purely cinematic\nlevel, The Lighthouse\nabsolutely satisfies\u2014it\nis a film to be seen on\nthe biggest screen with\nthe loudest sound system\nbecause it encapsulates\na retrospective artistic\napproach to filmmaking\nthat is rare in modern\ncinema. The framing\nand cinematography also\nevoke old photography\nand silent films. There\u2019s\na slight issue with the\naccents and dialogue of\nthe actors that are supposedly authentic of the\nperiod. It is borderline\nincomprehensible in some\nparts and I found it hard\nwork to decipher each\nsentence. Because of this\nI couldn\u2019t quite infuse into\nthe movie as the filmmakers intended.\nIn its setting, dialogue\nand a plot steeped in\nmysticism and folklore, it\ngarners the flavours of a\nShakespeare tragedy, but\nsimultaneously is a cinematic experience. It is like\nseeing poetry onscreen\nbut was slightly incomplete for me as a piece of\nnarrative filmmaking.\nPattinson and Dafoe as Ephraim Winslow and Thomas Wake respectively // A24\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Writer\nDir: Robert Eggers.

    "content": "New Video Game Releases in February 2020: Dreams,\nStarting this month, we here at Felix Games are going\nto be updating you with the best upcoming releases of\nthe month. February is looking to be a relatively slow\nmonth, lacking in hard hitters, but there are some gems\ncoming out that are sure to hold any type of gamer over\nuntil the big AAA titles of the year start to show up.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan\nof the genre,\nor simply love\nDarksidersyou should\npick it up in a\nheartbeat\u201d\nDreams\nM\ny most\nanticipated\ngame of\nFebruary is\nthe long-awaited Dreams.\nThis is an exclusive for\nthe PS4 that is finally\nhitting shelves on 14th\nFebruary, the perfect\nValentine\u2019s gift for your\ngamer bae. Dreams looks\nto be an extraordinary,\nendless game universe,\nwhere you can discover\ncommunity-made games\nfrom around the world,\nas well as being able to\ncreate your own! It is\ncoming from one of my\nfavourite, award winning\nstudios: Media Molecule\n\u2013 creators of Little Big\nPlanet, a game which took\nthe world by storm back\nin the PS3 days.\nAdding to the list\nof games by the studio\nwith a focus on creation,\nDreams looks to evolve\nwhat it means to show\ncreativity within a game.\nWith countless, easy to\nuse tools at your disposal,\nDreams looks to allow\nanyone to share their ideas\nwith a global community\nfull of innovators.\nWhether you want\nto create games, music,\npaintings, animation,\nsculpture, movies or\nsimply just play, Dreams\nis the perfect game to\nexpress yourself \u2013 with\nendless replayability, it\nis sure to be worth the\n\u00a334.99 price tag.\nSnack World: The\nDungeon Crawl Gold\nAlso coming out on\nValentine\u2019s Day, Snack\nWorld: The Dungeon\nCrawl Gold is a charming,\nwhacky RPG by the\ncreators of Professor\nLayton and Fantasy Life.\nBeing a port of a Japanese\ngame, we already know\nwhat to expect from this\nNintendo Switch exclu-sive. After your village\nis invaded, you become\na heroic adventurer and\nseek revenge against the\nvillainous Sultan Vinegar.\nYou can play alone, or\nteam up with up to 3\nplayers in local or online\nmultiplayer to crawl\nthroughahostofrandomly\ngenerated dungeons. The\n\u201cGold\u201d part of the title\nmeans that it is releasing\nwith all the DLC from\nthe Japanese game at no\nextra cost. While it does\nseem a bit too ludicrous\nfor some players, the very\nmeta fourth wall breaking\nand combination of high\nfantasy with high tech\nlook to make an interesting title.\nDarksiders Genesis\nYet another game\nbeing released on the\n14th, Darksiders Genesis\nis a spin-off Darksiders\ntitle for all major home\nconsoles. Having already\nbeen released on PC late\nlast year, we have a pretty\ngoodideaofwhattoexpect\nfrom it \u2013 with a respectable 77% on Metacritic. It\nis a top-down, hack and\nslash, action, roleplaying\ngame\u2026 in short: it\u2019s like\nDiablo. Despite a growing\nabundance of these Diablo-type games in recent\nyears on the Switch, Darksiders Genesis looks to\nquench the thirst of Sony\nand Microsoft lovers in\nneed of a top-down hack\nand slash game. This is a\nmust play for any fan of\nthe Darksiders lore, taking\nplace before any of the\nmain games and exploring\nthe origin of the Seven\nSeals. Another aspect\nwhich is surely a staple\nin games of this manor\nnowadays is the ability to\nplay fully in Co-op, yes\nplease! Unfortunately,\nit does not seem to do\nanything new with the\ngenre, so if you are unsure\nabout getting it, I would\ngive it a miss. On the other\nhand, if you\u2019re a fan of\nthe genre, or simply love\nDarksiders \u2013 you should\npick it up in a heartbeat.\nOne Punch Man: A\nHero Nobody Knows\nJust like the title, it\nseems that not that many\npeople know this game\nis coming out! Releasing\non the 27th February on\nPS4, Xbox One and PC,\nOne Punch Man: A Hero\nNobody Knows is an\nupcoming fighting game\nby Bandai Namco. It\nseems very different to the\ntypical 3D fighting game.\nWith combat that reminds\nme of Tekken, you play\nas any one of a group\nof eclectic characters,\nfighting one of the many\nenemies of the One Punch\nMan universe. However,\nthe aim isn\u2019t necessarily\nto win the battle, but\ninstead just survive until\nSaitama (One Punch\nMan) shows up so that\nhe can deliver the final\nblow in a single punch!\nThink along the lines of\na tactical nuke from COD\nMW2\u2026 those were the\ndays. It is an interesting\nconcept, but I fear the\nidea may quickly become\nstale. I\u2019m probably going\nto pick it up, though once\nit is discounted. If you\u2019re\na fan of the anime, or the\nmanga, I see no harm in\ngrabbing it\u2026 other than\nto your wallet. \u00a350 seems\npricey for such a game,\nouch.\nThe Dark Crystal: Age\nof Resistance Tactics\nThe Dark Crystal: Age\nof Resistance Tactics,\nbased off the Netflix\nshow of the same name\n(minus the tactics bit) is\na turn-based tactics game,\nsimilar to the likes of Final\nFantasy Tactics, with a 3D\nenvironment to interact\nwith and a whole host of\nenvironmental objects at\nyour disposal. It\u2019s coming\nout on pretty much\neverything on February\n4th. I can\u2019t say I am that\nexcited as I haven\u2019t seen\nthe show, nor do I enjoy\ntactics games all too\nmuch. But I am sure this\nfits the niche of many a\nplayer out there. It comes\nwith around 50 battles, a\nDreams is finally launching after years of teasers! // Media Molecule/Sony\nGAMES\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020 FELIX\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\n\n"

Uprising?\nActor Laurence Fox and his comments brought him both criticism and praise. Has the white-shaming rhetoric gone too far?\nCOMMENT\nSung Soo Moon\nComment Editor\nT\nhere\u2019s been controversy about\nactor Laurence\nFox\u2019s comments\nregarding race in the past\ncouple of weeks. It seems\nthat both sides of the\ndebate seem bitterly passionate about their stance\nand Fox\u2019s opinions have\nresonated with many.\nThe issues surrounding\nrace and the formalism\nin which there may be\ndebate has not come to a\nconsensus in all members\nof the society; we are in\nsome transient period\nwhere racial issues are\naddressed but remain a\ngrey area. In general, the\ninevitability of discourse\nwill lead to new ideas\nreplacing the old.\nFox\u2019s media attention\nstarted with a Question\nTime programme where\nhe clashed with mixed\nrace university lecturer\nRachel Boyle who\nargued that the treatment\nof Meghan Markle by the\npress was racism. Fox\nsaid it\u2019s not racism and\nthat Britain is \u201cthe most\ntolerant, lovely country\nin Europe\u201d and that\naccusations of racism\nare \u201cboring\u201d. Boyle\nhit back calling Fox a\n\u201cwhite privileged male\u201d,\nand Fox exclaimed that\nBoyle was herself being\nracist to him by saying\nthat.\nAnother incident\nconcerning Fox was\nthe comments he made\nabout Sam Mendes\u2019\nWWI epic, 1917. The\nfilm portrays Sikh\nsoldiers who fought\nalong British forces,\nand Fox said in James\nDellingpole\u2019s podcast\nthat it \u201cdiverted\u201d him\naway from the story\nand was \u201cinstitutional\nracism\u201d to be forcing\ndiversity in the movie\nindustry. Fox has since\nthen apologised for this\ncomment and to the\nSikhs that he offended,\nas it is a historical fact\nthat many Sikhs as part\nof the Indian Army\nfought and died in the\nGreat War. Fox has since\nacknowledged this and\napologised.\nThe reaction to\nFox\u2019s initial comments\nand continued media\nattention demonstrates\nthat he is not alone\nin his views, and his\nopinions certainly have\nresonated with people.\nThat opinion being that\npolitical correctness has\ngone too far, and white\n(straight male) people\nare at the receiving end.\nWe are witnessing the\nrelease of white frustration after supposed\nsuppression by a leftist\nsociety.\nThe story so far: the\nwhite guilt narrative\nentered the social conscience and had by-prod-ucts like fashionable\nwhite supremacy and\nextremism which have\nbeen brewing under the\nsurface. Progressive and\nleft ideas aren\u2019t readily\nchallenged by those\nworkplace, the media,\nand culture. This shift in\npower and media attention is causing unrest,\nas traditional ideals and\nnorms are brought to\nscrutiny with no time to\nreact. With the internet\nfacilitating more extremism and amplifying\nlike-minded views on all\nsides, it traps people in\nperpetuating confirmation bias on all sides of\nthe spectrum, arguably\na consequence of liber-alism. Fox represents\nthis\u2014outspoken and\nunafraid of seemingly\ncontroversial comments,\nand the support he has\nhad is evidence that\nthese are the kinds of\nincidents we will see\nas a reaction to the\nmovement. I expect an\nuprising against white\n\u2018repression\u2019.\nUnless we can talk\nabout race and racism in\na manner that everyone\ncan agree on, any\nprogress is impossible.\nThe two strains of\nthought cannot exist\nharmoniously in unison,\nand thus can only induce\nfurther conflict. After a\nvery eggshell laden path\ntowards our modern attitudes of race and related\ntopics of debate in which\nmany people are con-flicted, we will see more\ninstances of outspoken\nopposition against the\nnorm. Laurence Fox is\nnot alone in this opinion\nthat white people are\nunjustly villainised in\nthe mainstream narra-tive. White rage will\nconfront and there will\nbe consequences.\nEveryone ready to have a civilised conversation about race // Wikimedia\n\u201cThe\ndemonization\nof traditional\nmasculine\nvalues with\nno given\nalternative\nleads to\nresentment\u201d\nwho oppose them, as\nsociety is still unsure of\nthe implications of race\nand how to deal with the\nnotion of systematic institutional racism. This\nhas led to outspoken\npeople who are outraged\nat the progressive attitudes and \u201csnowflakes\u201d\nwho are sensitive about\npolitical correctness.\nThe non-PC voices\nunafraid and unadulterated by the pressures to\nconform are singled out\nand emphasised, where\nFox\u2019s comments were\nlabelled \u201crefreshing\u201d\nby many. Thus, begins\na white renaissance, not\nconforming to the white\nguilt rhetoric. Straight\nwhite men feel under\nattack for who they are,\nand it\u2019s not like they\u2019re\ngoing to take the back\nseat on this. The demonization of traditional\nmasculine values with no\ngiven alternative leads\nto resentment towards\nthose who only criticise.\nDue to the changing\ntides in the world, many\nare disillusioned further,\nleading to the incubation\nof dangerous ideas on\nall sides.\nThe world has become\na more inclusive place\nvery quickly\u2014within a\ngeneration, the attitudes\nthat have changed are\nimmense, from race, to\nsex and sexuality, and\nother minorities in the\n\u201cWe are\nwitnessing\nthe release\nof white\nfrustration\u201d\n\n"

The path of history\nsince the dawn of the\nscientific method has\nbeen marked by both an\nintense development of\nour productivity and a\ngeneral trend towards\ngreater secularism, the\nformer of which has\nculminated in our familiar global capitalism.\nThis development has\nprovided benefits far\nbeyond those already\nmentioned, but it has\nalso led to some terrible\nevents and hitherto\nunimaginable levels of\nexploitation. Here, I\u2019m\nnot going to talk about\nany of that. Instead, I\u2019m\ninterested in how all\nthis plays with our most\nfundamental desire:\nmeaning.\nIf there\u2019s one characteristic which unites all\nhumans, it\u2019s an implicit\nacknowledgement of the\nabsurdity of their condi-tion. It confronts us every\ntime we stare at the stars\nand feel powerless; it rears\nits head whenever we\ncontemplate life beyond\nour subjectivity. We can\u2019t\nlive like this, of course,\nand so we\u2019ve always\nmanaged to \ufb01nd ways to\ncomfort ourselves. The\nmost obvious of these is\nspirituality, which has\noften manifested itself as\nsome form of religion.\nThe belief in something\ngreater than man, which\nought to be intrinsically\nunknowable, is powerful:\nwhen we accept a limit to\nthe agency we can a priori\nexert over nature, we\npsychologically relieve\nourselves of precisely this\nlimitation. What\u2019s more,\nthis acceptance comes\nwith free meaning, since\nnature, the predicate for\nthis belief starts to fall\naway.\nAs science comes to the\nfore in history and a more\nsecular society begins to\nemerge, we come to understand more about the\nworld, so the need to \ufb01ll\nthe gaps with such thought\nseems to diminish. But, as\nyou may have guessed,\nI\u2019m not sure that this\nis the case. Sure, our\nobjective knowledge is at\nan all-time high, but the\nmore we learn, the more\ncomplex and unknowable the world appears\nto become. Capitalism\nmoves in tandem with\nscience, and along with\nthe wealth it generates\ncome odd new phenom-ena. The commodi\ufb01ed\nform of social relations\nestranges us from our-selves; our connection\nto our products seems\nincreasingly tenuous. In\nshort, objectivity is not\nenough. We need to \ufb01nd\nroom for transcendence\nsomewhere in all this, and\ninterestingly capitalism\nitself has provided an\nanswer. Through the very\nsame mechanisms which\nalienate products from\nlabour, commodities\ntake on meaning beyond\nthemselves via their social\nposition in the market.\nIn essence, commodities\ncome with transcendence\nfor free, and so our desire\nfor meaning translates into\na lust for consumption.\nIf seeking the\ntranscendent is one way\nout of an existential crisis,\nthen another can be found\nin ourselves. Living in\ncommunities where we\nunderstand our position\nand relationships can give\nus the tangible comfort of\nbelonging. I feel most at\nease when I understand\nmyself as part of a whole,\nand not in isolation \u2013\nperhaps I would have\nmade a poor Romantic\nhero. In pre-industrial\nthe answer is not clear in\ngeneral, nor is it uniform.\nEither way, our method\nfor \ufb01nding comfort in\nour communities has to\nchange as those communities do. For the moment,\nhistory is moving faster\nthan philosophy.\nWhere does all this\nleave us? It would seem\nthat the development of\nscience and capitalism has\ntoday left us in a curious\nexistential position. It has\nsimultaneously secular-ised and objecti\ufb01ed life\nitself by attempting to\nreplace divine transcendence with the joy of an\nApple product. It has also\nfundamentally changed\nthe way that our communities operate, forcing us\nto rethink how we live and\nfeel together.These effects\naren\u2019t disjoint either, and\ntheir interactions become\nmore intricate by the day.\nGiven this, society has a\nquestion to answer: are we\nOK with this? Seemingly,\nmany people say no.\nThe recent resurgence of\nreactionary conservatism\nand populism could be\nunderstood as a reaction\nto the theft of meaning.\nMaybe none of this\nreally matters. After all,\nwhat is the real difference between an effigy\nand an iPhone? And\nhow can we know how\nour communities will\ncontinue to evolve under\nthe present conditions?\nBut I think that the wave\nof reaction we see today\ncan, at least in part, be\nunderstood as part of a\nhistorical shift in how\nwe find meaning in the\nworld. If that\u2019s the case,\nthen we owe it to ourselves to find it better.\nPope on the ropes // @assdesiign\n\u201c...our desire\nfor meaning\ntranslates\ninto a lust for\nconsumption\u201d\nsociety, life was dominated by the local, and as\nsuch it could be intuitively\nunderstood. Today\u2019s\nworld interacts with the\nold idea of the community\nin a subtle way, but I\u2019d\nargue that there are two\nmain things which shape\nit the most. On the one\nhand we have the Internet,\nwhich creates opportunities for totally new kinds\nof community, no longer\nseparated by space. On\nthe other we have globali-sation, which has shrunk\nthe world market-wise\nand people-wise, allowing\nfor greater contact - and\nexploitation \u2013 between\npeople than ever before.\nIn both of these cases,\npeople become acutely\naware of their relative\nsize in this new global\ncommunity, and this\nleaves them with two\ninevitable questions. How\ndo I \ufb01t in here? How can I\ncontinue to feel meaningful agency? How indeed:\nif we can have faith in\nsomething transcendent\nthen we absolve ourselves\nof the responsibility. But\nas we challenge previous\nlimitations and come to\nexert greater agency over\n\n"

Despite being\nseemingly adored by his\nfamily and their friends,\nBen is aware that any\ninterest is temporary until\nhe makes the next step in\nhis life. This step he de-cides, albeit reluctantly, is\nto have an affair with Mrs.\nRobinson, a family friend.\nThe arrangement with\nMrs. Robinson seems to\nwork perfectly until Ben\ndecides that he has fallen\nin love with, and wants\nto marry Mrs Robinson\u2019s\ndaughter, Elaine.\nDirector Mike Nichols,\nrecipient of the 1967\nacademy award for best\ndirector, could have his\nsuccess with this film\nattributed to his decision\nto stray from conventions\nof the era and instead look\nto the French new wave\nfor inspiration. What\nmakes this movie special\nis that scenes which could\nhave been wearisome and\ndull are replaced with an\nentirely fascinating and\nunique vehicle for representing the passing of\ntime, censoring is replaced\nwith hilarious cuts and a\nselection of unconventional cinematography\nchoices are sprinkled in\nunevenly throughout the\nfirst third. By unconventional choices think\nwatching Ben from his\npoint of view, being\nforced to plunge into his\nfamily pool while wearing\nhis brand-new scuba\nsuit, only to sink to the\nbottom to contemplate\nwhat he\u2019s doing with his\nlife. If trying to place the\nGraduate in a category,\noffbeat comedies of the\nlikes of \u2018Punch Drunk\nLove\u2019 or \u2018Breakfast at\nTiffany\u2019s\u2019 are comparable,\nwhere offbeat overshadows most of the comedy.\nLooking past the\ndirector, it is also Dustin\nHoffman\u2019s debut performance that makes this.\nHoffman manages to\nperfectly capture youthful\nnaivety, rebellion, erratic\ndecision making and the\nfeeling of just wanting a\nlong, long, LONG break.\nBen\u2019s character is almost\nlike five different people\nin one, but he is portrayed\nin a manner that makes his\ncharactermaketotalsense,\nand despite his questionable life choices in his film,\nmakes Ben a relatable\nguy. The real star of this\nfilm is the soundtrack\nwritten entirely by Simon\nand Garfunkel, with each\ncharacter having a theme\nchosen from the bands\nrepertoire, with of course\nhit song \u2018Mrs Robinson\u2019\nbeing written specifically\nfor the film.\nAs people working to\nhopefully graduate one\nday, The Graduate is\nequal parts refreshing and\nbleak. Maybe we can hope\nfor something slightly\nbetter for ourselves.\nFILM\nJasmin Daley\nFilm Writer\nHere\u2019s to you, Mrs Robinson// Mike Nichols\nWe\u2019re in the thick of award season, making it a good time to throwback to a film that caused a buzz this time of\nyear in 1967.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1741\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nJANUARY, 2020\n28\nRCSU\nPeter Hull\nRCSU VP (Welfare)\nL\nast Tuesday,\nUnion Council\nvoted to approve\nthe introduction\nof a student Officer to\nrepresent students from\nsocio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.\nThis was mainly due to\nShervin Sabeghi, Deputy\nPresident for Welfare,\nwith the support of the\nCommunity and Welfare\nBoard which I sit on\nas a Constituent Union\nWelfare Officer. This is\na welcome improvement\nto how Council deals\nwith socio-economic\ninequality, given that\nsimilar proposals failed\ntwice in 2018. Joining\nthe ranks of the newly\nreformed Liberation and\nCommunity Networks,\nthe student elected to this\nposition will lead a group\nof representatives to tackle\nthe most unacceptable\naspect of this university:\nhow it interacts with the\npoorest of our society.\nIt\u2019s no secret that\nImperial is one of the\nmost unequal universities\nin the UK. In 2017, the\nmost recent year for\nwhich UCAS published\ndata, Imperial had the\nbiggest gap in entry rate\nbetween students from\nthe most and least advantaged areas out of all UK\nuniversities. Out of the 7\nmost unequal universities\naccording to this metric,\nImperial was the only\nuniversity to actually get\nworse between 2010 and\n2017. Oxford, Cambridge,\nBristol, King\u2019s, SOAS,\nUCL, Durham and Brunel\nall decreased the entry rate\nratio in this timeframe.\nWhy should Imperial be\nany different?.\nEven if the gap in\nentry rate was improved,\nthe change in drop-out\nrates across socio-eco-nomic status is damning.\nStudents from the most\ndisadvantaged areas of\nthe UK are twice as likely\nto drop out than those\nfrom the most advantaged\nareas \u2013 a drop-out rate of\n8.1% compared to 3.7%.\nThis is true even though\nCollege has a decent\nare obvious: it\u2019s outdated,\nworking class is used as\nan insult, you can be poor\nwithout being working\nclass, you can be working\nclass without being poor,\nand so on. Having the\nword Class at all is a\nreminder of the system we\nhave to operate within.\nBut are the alternatives\nbetter? All other terms are\nunrelatable, vague, and\nreek of trying to erase\nidentities and reinforce\ncertain ideals. Social\nMobility and Widening\nParticipation both put\nemphasis on moving\ndisadvantaged students\ninto the middle-class\nway of life. It could be\nargued we need a label\nto identify with, like with\nBME and LGBTQ+, and\nunfortunately Working\nClass is the only label that\nexists that is short enough\n- Students from Disadvantaged Socio-Economic\nBackgrounds Officer\nobviously wouldn\u2019t fit on\nany election handouts.\nWith pressure from\noutside of Council, it\nlooks like it\u2019ll be changed\nto Widening Participation\n(WP) Officer to be consistent with the language\nthat College use in their\nadmissions and financial\naid processes. Applicants\nhave started referring\nto themselves as WP\nstudents, decreasing the\nimpact of the argument\nthat Working Class is the\nonly term that students\nwill understand and\nidentify with. But is this\nstill a way of saying that\nthe poor have to participate in and conform to the\nliberal middle-class ideals\nthat Imperial sets out for\nthem? Or should we take\nit at face value, as a simple\nway to say that we want as\nwide a group as possible\nto have the opportunity to\nparticipate in education?\nThe fact we even have\nto talk about the name is\na hint that something is\nwrong with how we talk\nabout socio-economic\ninequality. Instead of\npushing hard against the\nactions of College we beat\naround the bush and erase\nthe identities of those\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds by pigeonholing\nthem in language that isn\u2019t\nrepresentative or useful.\nWe spend hours coming\nup with the best name to\npropose to Council so\nthat it doesn\u2019t get voted\ndown according to their\nmiddle-class biases and\npreconceptions, instead\nof refining how exactly\nthe Officer can campaign\neffectively against the\nplanned rent price hikes\nand the eye-watering cost\nof living.\nInterestingly, in 2018\nthis proposal didn\u2019t fail\nbecause of the criticisms\nabove. The then-Deputy\nPresident for Welfare said\nthe role \u201cwould function\nmore to single out than\nto represent\u201d. Effectively,\nthe criticism is that the\nproject and the term itself\n\u2018others\u2019 the working class.\nOthering is a morally\nbankrupt concept that we\ncould just as well use to\njustify telling anyone who\nisn\u2019t a rich straight white\nmale to stop bringing\nattention to their differ-ences. Anyone supporting\nthis position should also\nbe in favour of removing\nthe LGBTQ+, BME, and\nGender Equality networks\nentirely. Luckily, this was\nquickly dismissed this\ntime round, but the fact\nthat it came up at all is a\nsymptom of the problematic way in which we talk\nabout class inequality.\nRegardless of the\nname, I\u2019m optimistic that\na Union Officer in this\nrole will give a greater\nvoice to students that have\nbeen let down by Imperial\u2019s failure to be inclusive.\nHopefully they can be\nhonest about the problems\nand represent students\neffectively, improving the\nway in which Union talks\nabout class as well as\ncampaigning hard against\nCollege. Imperial cannot\ngo on increasing the gap\nbetween the richest and\npoorest in society within\nits student body. This is\na much-needed first step\nin campaigning against\ndiscrimination, communicating the issues within\nUnion more effectively,\nand giving more power\nand voice to those who\nneed it most.\n\u201cStudents\nfrom the most\ndisadvantaged\nareas of the\nUK are twice as\nlikely to drop\nout as those\nfrom the most\nadvantaged\u201d\nbursary scheme (without\nwhich I wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen able to study here at\nall). This shows that it\u2019s\nnot just about the absurd\ncost of living in South\nKensington, it\u2019s also the\nculture shock and the attitudes of the student body,\nand the way in which all\nof this is made worse by\nacademic pressure and\nstrained mental health\nsupport services. These\nmore subtle issues are\nexactly the motivation\nbehind introducing Union\nOfficer positions with this\nin their remit.\nSo, will this new Union\nOfficer help? Well, first\nlet\u2019s address the fact that I\nhaven\u2019t told you the name\nof the role yet.\nThis project was\napproved within minutes\nby the Community and\nWelfare Board before it\ngot to Union Council, but\nwe struggled to agree on a\nname before circling back\nto Working Class Officer.\nWhenever I bring this up\nto someone their facial\nexpression is like I just\ndrop-kicked their dog.\nThe arguments against it\nWhy Can\u2019t the IC Union Talk About Class?\nCONSTITUENT UNION felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPeter Hull, RCSU VP(Welfare) and member of the CWB // RCSU, Peter Hull\n\u201cThe fact that\nwe even have\nto talk about\nthe name is a\nhint that there\nis something\nis wrong with\nhow we talk\nabout socioeconomic\ninequality\u201d\n\n"

This ensures that\nthe bank can still function\nin the case that many of its\ncustomers decide to withdraw their savings at once,\nthus avoiding default.\nInteraction with for-pro\ufb01t\n\ufb01nancial institutions also\nentails lending to them.\nEvery central bank sets\nthe base rate, which is\nthe rate it charges its\ncommercial counterparts\nfor borrowing from it. A\ndecrease in the base rate\nallows a commercial bank\nto reduce its borrowing\ncost. Hence, it can loan\nmoney to its customers\nat a lower interest rate.\nConsequently, it can\nbe argued that central\nbanks set interest rates\nfor the entire economy.\nNowadays,severalofthem\nare considered independent from the government,\nwhich means they do not\nreceive orders about how\nto perform their duties,\nsuch as setting interest\nrates. However, they still\ndo need to cooperate with\nthe Ministries of Finance,\nas they provide advice to\nministers and coordinate\nwith them on matters of\ngeneral economic policy.\nMonetary Policy\nMonetary policy can be\nde\ufb01ned as the set of decisions taken by the central\nbank regarding the supply\nof money in the economy,\nin order to achieve certain\neconomic targets, such as\na lower unemployment\nrate, or boosting economic\noutput. Money supply\nrefers to the total amount\nof currency, i.e. coins,\ncash, balances in current\nand savings accounts, circulating in the economy. It\ncan be broadly classi\ufb01ed\ninto expansionary and\ncontractionary.\nExpansionary monetary\npolicy is deemed essential\nat times of recession. It\nusually entails cutting\ninterest rates with the goal\nof encouraging consumers\nto spend rather than save\nmoney and allow \ufb01rms\nand individuals to borrow\nfunds on improved terms.\nAs a result, businesses\nwill invest more resources\ninto providing a larger\nnumber of higher quality\nproducts and consumers\nwill respond to that\nshift by increasing their\nspending. Hence, unemployment will decrease,\nand the economy will exit\nthe recessionary stage.\nHowever, expansionary\npolicy can also lead to a\nhigher rate of in\ufb02ation.\nIn\ufb02ation is the phenome-ISSUE 1741\nThe Bank of England, sometimes known as \u201cThe Old Lady of Threadneedle Street\u201d has been\non Threadneedle Street in the City of London, since 1734 //NYPL Public Domain Archive\nnon related to the general\ntendency of product prices\nto rise over time. An\nuncontrollable increase\nof in\ufb02ation will cause a\ndecrease in consumer\u2019s\npurchasing power. The\nreason why this happens is\nthat the injection of money\ninto the economy cannot\ninstantaneously lead to a\nrise in output. Therefore,\nfor a certain time period,\na larger amount of cash\nis being used to purchase\nessentially the same\nnumber of goods. As\nper the Law of Supply,\nif the supply remains\nconstant, higher demand\nwill lead to higher prices.\nA higher in\ufb02ation rate\nmay therefore cancel the\ngains of an expansionary\nmonetary policy. Contractionary policy is therefore\nrequired to combat rising\nin\ufb02ation. Particularly,\nthe money supply is\ndecreased, aimed at discouraging borrowing and\nspending. By decreasing\ndemand, given a constant\nsupply, producers will\nbegin to reduce prices,\nand thus in\ufb02ation will be\nbrought under control.\nHowever, this policy has\nthe undesirable effects of\nslowing down growth and\ncausing an upswing in\nunemployment.\nHow does the Central\nBank Determine Monetary Policy?\nAn important question\nto ask is, how does the\ncentral bank implement\nmonetary policy? Printing\nmoremoneyisthesimplest\nanswer. It is employed\nas a technique when the\neconomy has entered\nrecession. However, it is\nnot an optimal choice, as\nit is directly linked with\nthe danger of uncontrollable in\ufb02ation. Instead,\nthe methods discussed\nbelow are deemed more\npreferable.\nReducing the reserve\nrequirement and decreas-ingthebaseratehelplower\nthe cost of borrowing,\nthus boosting the money\nsupply. Particularly, if a\nA\ncentral bank\nhas a different\nmission from a\nconventional,\ncommercial bank: it operates in the public\u2019s interest\nas it seeks to promote economic development. The\n\ufb01rst central bank was\nestablished in the UK.\nNamely, the Bank of\nEngland was founded in\n1694. Since the Brussels\nFinancial Conference of\n1920, a central bank has\nbeen established in almost\nall countries around\nthe world. A central\nbank\u2019s most fundamental\n\u201c...it operates\nin the public\u2019s\ninterest as\nit seeks to\npromote\neconomic\ndevelopment \u201d\nto all investment products\noffered by the govern-ment, with bonds being\nthe most common. Bonds\ncan be generally thought\nof as a type of loan. In\nthis case, the government\nsells these to commercial\nbanks, among other\ninvestors, in exchange\nfor a certain amount,\nwhich must be repaid at a\nspeci\ufb01c date. During that\nwaiting period, the bank\nis unable to pro\ufb01t from\nthis activity. During a re-cession, central banks will\noffer to buy government\nbonds from mainstream\nbanks, allowing the latter\nto immediately generate\na pro\ufb01t. Consequently,\n\ufb01nancial institutions will\nhave more capital available to lend to consumers,\nwhich combined with\nlower rates, will render\nborrowing more attrac-tive. In a particularly dire\neconomic climate, central\nbanks will introduce a\nquantitative-easing (QE)\nprogram that takes the\npolicy of buying government investment products\na step further. Central\nbanks purchase bonds\ndirectly, which have been\nissued by governments\nand \ufb01rms. Thus, the\nentities which have issued\nthe bonds immediately\nreceive capital in the\nform of payment for the\npurchase of these bonds.\nHence \ufb01rms, mainly\nbanks, can lend money\nmore easily, leading to a\nrise in the money supply.\nConclusion\nCentral banks have\nindisputably become one\nof the leading actors in\nthe economy. Nowadays,\na policy announced by\nthe governor of a central\nbank directly impacts the\neconomic climate not only\nin the region, but perhaps\nglobally. Given that the\nglobal economy has not\nyet been able to \ufb01nd\nitself in a path of sluggish\ngrowth, central banks will\ncontinue to be the protagonists of \ufb01nancial news\nand commentary.\nfunction is issuing curren-cy. Only a central bank has\npermission from the government to print money. A\ncentral bank differs from\na traditional institution in\nanother way: it does not\ninteract with the general\npublic. Instead, it deals\nonly with commercial\nbanks because regulating\nthe latter\u2019s activities\nconstitutes another part\nof their mission. Financial\nregulations are rules\ndesigned to control the\neconomic behaviour of\n\ufb01rms in the private sector.\nA characteristic example\nwould be capital require-ments; each commercial\nbank must hold, at any\n\u201cAn important\nquestion to ask\n...how does the\ncentral bank\nimplement\nmonetary\npolicy? \u201d\nbank is mandated to hold a\nlower amount of money in\ncash form, often referred\nto as liquid assets, it has\nbeen given the ability\nto lend more money. As\npreviously mentioned,\nthe base rate determines\nthe interest charged to\nbanks borrowing from the\ncentral bank. Therefore,\nreducing the base rate\nleads to a drop in the cost\nof loans for commercial\nbanks. This then translates\ninto reduced interest rates\nfor consumers. Furthermore, the purchase and\nsale of government-secu-rities represents another\nway for central banks\nto affect the amount of\nmoney circulating in the\neconomy.

Whatever platform\nyou choose to game on,\nyou now have access and\nI cannot recommend it\nenough.\nStreet Fighter V\nChampion Edition\nEveryone and their\nmum, and their dog,\nStreet Fighter V, but want\na way of getting all the\nDLC, you can purchase\nthe upgrade kit for \u00a325.\nThis gives you access to\neverything that is available in Champion Edition,\nwithout having to buy a\nnew game or all the DLC\nseparately.\nOther Games\nThere are some more\nreleases that I didn\u2019t think\nwere worth dedicating\nwhole paragraphs to.\nRomance of the Three\nKingdoms XIV is a CIV\nlike turn based strategy\ngame that utilises a\nhexagon layout. Rune\nFactory 4 Special, a\nFantasy JRPG with town\nbuilding mechanics, is\nthe newest instalment in\nthe Rune Factory series\nwith upgraded CG and\nnew difficulty levels,\nRune Factory was a big\ninspiration for Stardew\nvalley, so if you are a fan\nof that (who isn\u2019t) then\nI\u2019d recommend checking\nit out. Monster Energy\nSupercross is a high\noctane, fast paced racing\ngame that looks to be a lot\nof fun. If you forget the\nbranded name, this looks\nto be a pretty solid entry\nfor racing games with\na focus on motocross,\nwhich we don\u2019t often see.\nSo, there you have it.\nThere are plenty of games\ncoming out this month,\nthe majority of which\nare lower budget titles.\nIt\u2019s a month that gives\nus a chance to breathe,\ngo through our backlog\nand maybe pick up some\ngames that pique our\ninterest. Personally, I am\nmost excited for Dreams\nand Mega Man Zero/\nZX Legacy Collection,\nbut this month really has\nsomething for everyone\n\u2013 whether you enjoy\nstrategy, action platform-ers, shooters or fighting\ngames.\nStreet Fighter V: Champion Edition is coming to both PS4 and PC on the 14th - Valentine\u2019s is best experienced with a hadouken // Capcom\nISSUE 1741\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\n\u201cEveryone and\ntheir mum\nand their dog\nknows about\nStreet Fighter\u201d\nknows what Street Fighter\nis. This release, coming\nto the PS4 and PC on\nFebruary 14th, is the\nmost complete version of\nStreet Fighter V. It has all\nthe DLC (bar a few pro\ntour/brand collaboration\ncostumes), meaning 40\nfighters, 34 stages and\nover 200 costumes. I am\nyet to own Street Fighter\nV, so I am definitely going\nto jump into this. At \u00a330 it\nis a fair price especially if\nyou are yet to buy Street\nFighter V, standard or\narcade edition.

    "content": "The Link between Animal Consumption and Global\nPandemics\nH\nIV, in\ufb02uenza,\nEbola, Spanish\n\ufb02u, and SARS\nall share one\nthing in common, and that\nis that those pandemics all\noriginated from animals.\nThis feature is also shared\nby the novel coronavirus\nepidemic that started in\nWuhan (which is still not\nconsidered a pandemic\nyet, as the scale is not big\nenough as of now).\nThose diseases are\nsaid to be zoonotic,\nwhich is the spread of\ndisease between species.\nThis de\ufb01nition does not\nrestrict the diseases to\ntransmission from other\nanimals to humans, it can\nbe between any animals.\nAnd for many zoonotic\ndiseases, the spread of\nthe disease happens to\nmultiple species. For\nexample, the Ebola virus\nis thought to originate\nfrom bats, and can infect\nprimates, dogs, pigs, and\nhumans. There are other\nnon-infectious zoonotic\ndiseases from animal\nconsumption such as mad\ncow disease. However,\nthe ones that cause epidemics and pandemics\nare infectious and once\nin humans, they transmit\nfrom human-to-human,\nrequiring no contact with\nthe original host animal.\nThe zoonotic disease\noutbreaks in humans\nare almost all thought to\noriginate from animal\nconsumption. For HIV, the\norigin was the consumption of bushmeat from\nChimpanzees with simian\nfoamy virus (Ebola also\noriginated from bushmeat\nconsumption). Bushmeat\nis an important source\nof food for people from\ncertain cultural back-grounds, especially those\naffected by poverty. The\nissue is complex as even if\nthey were educated on the\nrisks of bushmeat, they\nmay not have a choice.\nFor those governments,\nit is important to work\non their food system and\nreduce poverty to ensure\npeople can access other\nfoods.\nFor countries like\nChina, the lack of regulation of \u2018wet markets\u2019\n(market selling meat,\nproduce, and sometimes\neven live animals) has\npreviously caused the\nSARS outbreak, and now\nthe coronavirus outbreak\nin Wuhan. Another contributing factor is cultural;\neating wild animal is\nconsidered a symbol of\nwealth because they are\nrarer and more expensive.\nThere is also misinformation and beliefs (stemming\nfrom traditional Chinese\nmedicine teachings, which\nare not evidence-based)\nthat wild animal consumption has health\nbene\ufb01ts. The markets are\nalso an important source\nof fresh produce and often\nhas products cheaper than\nsupermarkets. The marketplace where the new\ncoronavirus originated\nfrom sold is an example.\nAs of now, wildlife\ntrade has been banned in\nChina as of now due to\nthe coronavirus outbreak,\nwhich is a win from not\nonly the perspective of\nhealth, but also from the\nstandpoint of animal protection and conservation,\nas there was no regulation\non treatment of animals,\nand the source of animals\nbeing obtained.\nYou may think that\nany meat we consume in\nthe UK is risk free, but\nzoonotic diseases also\ncome from animals we\neat in the UK. The inconvenient truth is that those\nzoonotic diseases do not\nonly come from bushmeat\nand wild animals. Previously, swine \ufb02u and bird\n\ufb02u have also broken out,\nwhich are both strains\nof the in\ufb02uenza virus.\nIn 1917, the Spanish\n\ufb02u infected 500 million\npeople around the world\nand killed 5 percent of\nthe world\u2019s population\nat that time - a disease\nwhich originated from\nbirds. Animal agriculture\nis a de\ufb01nite contributing\nfactor for those diseases,\nas the disease passes to\nhumans through contact\nor consumption.\nFurthermore, more than\nhalf the world\u2019s antibiotics\nare used on farm animals,\nwhich contributes hugely\nto antibiotic resistance,\nand is a huge threat to\nglobal health. There\nis also the very likely\neventual development of\na superbug, resistant to all\nantibiotic treatments. This\nmay lead to very serious\nand dif\ufb01cult outbreaks in\nthe future.\nAnimal agriculture is\nalso a major contributor\nto global warming. This\nis also contributing to\ndisease, as mosquitos are\nnow able to live further\naway from the equator\nand spread diseases.

For the Ebola\noutbreak, I remember\nseeing a lot of racist\ncontent online against\nblack people. For the HIV\npandemic, the disease was\nblamed on gay people.\nCurrently, there is a lot of\nhatred towards Chinese\npeople. I want to remind\nyou that disease outbreaks\nhappen based on systematic problems (poverty,\nculture, censorship, lack\nof education), and that anybody\u2019s racism and hatred\nis not justi\ufb01ed by disease\noutbreaks. Now is a good\ntime to lookout for one\nother and acknowledge\nthat disease outbreaks are\nsomething that we face\ntogether, and that we can\nall do our parts by taking\nprecautions.\nWuhan virus outbreak map, as of January 30th.
