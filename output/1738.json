As\nmuch as it\u2019s surprising,\nSony indeed showcased\nits vision for \u201cfuture\nconcepts in the area of\nmobility\u201d by unveiling its\nprototype car \u2014 Vision\nS. The car, which focuses\nheavily on safety, has a\nwhopping thirty three\nautomotive grade sensors.\nIn addition, the car has\nan interesting safety\nfeature that uses sensors\nto monitor the driver\u2019s\nfacial expressions and\nbody movement to assess\ntheir concentration level;\nthis allows the system\nto alert the driver when\nthey\u2019re being distracted.\nAnother feature of this\nsystem is to assess the\noverall emotional mood\nin the cabin and adjust the\ntemperature, thus helping\npassengers feel comforta-ble. On the entertainment\nside, the car features a\npanoramic screen that\nstretches all the way\nupdates. Sony\u2019s vision of\nsafety, entertainment, and\nadaptability does indeed\ngive us a more realistic\nglimpse of what the future\nof transport could hold\nover the next decade.\nSamsung Odyssey G9\nSamsung has proved its\nmastery of curved displays\nwith its new Odyssey\nG9, a massive (and not\nto mention extreme) 49\u201d\n1440p curved gaming\nmonitor that boasts a\nbuttery-smooth 240 Hz\npanel. It\u2019s hard to comprehend it\u2019s size unless\nyou\u2019re sitting in front of\nit. To give you an idea,\nit envelops your entire\nhorizontal field of vision!\nTo put it in a bit more per-spective, it\u2019s like having\na dual monitor setup\nwithout an interfering\nbezel in the middle. With\nsuch extreme specifica-tions, don\u2019t expect this\nmonitor to be cheap, and\nto make use of its full po-tential, you\u2019ll need quite a\nbeefy gaming rig.\nOnePlus Concept One\nOnePlus unveiled a\nnew concept phone at\nthe consumer electronics\nshow (CES) that features\na disappearing camera\nmodule. The phone,\nlike many concept cars,\nshowcases the company\u2019s\npotential and ability to\nexperiment with newer\ntechnologies and ideas.\nIn this case, OnePlus\nused electrochroamatic\nglass to cover the camera\nmodule, so when the\ncamera isn\u2019t being used,\nthe glass turns opaque and\nvice versa. Also, this new\nlayer acts as an ND filter\nwhen toggled through\nthe camera app. An ND\nfilter essentially helps\nreduce the amount of light\nentering the sensor when\nshooting in bright con-ditions. OnePlus hasn\u2019t\nstated whether this tech\nwould make its way into\nits upcoming smartphone\nlineup, but it\u2019s nevertheless an interesting idea.\nAlienware Concept\nUFO\nAlienware showed off\nan unexpected prototype\nthat merges handheld\nportability with the game\nselection that a PC has to\noffer. Meet the Concept\nUFO - an aggressive,\nangular looking Nintendo\nSwitch that runs on a\nversion of Windows 10.\nFor the demo, the device\nran Rocket League,\nMortal Kombat 11, and F1\n2019, and players reported\na smooth and lag-free\ngaming experience. Now,\nyou might be wondering\nwhat powers this tiny\nDell Concept Ori &\nConcept Duet\nFoldable laptops\nare now slowly taking\nshape. Last year, we saw\nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface Neo,\na foldable, dual screen\ndevice. This year, Dell\nis showing off two of its\nlatest prototypes: Concept\nOri and Concept Duet.\nConcept Ori follows\nalong Lenovo\u2019s foldable\nPC prototype (unveiled\nlast year) and features a\ncontinuous, foldable 13\u201d\nscreen that\u2019s QHD+. The\nother prototype, Concept\nDuet, follows Microsoft\u2019s\napproach by mounting two\ndisplays together through\na hinge mechanism. This\ndevice is essentially an\nXPS 13\u201d 2-in-1 where the\nlower keyboard deck is\nreplaced with a secondary display. Again, just\nlike other concepts, Dell\nhasn\u2019t commented on\nwhether these prototypes\nwould soon take shape\nin the consumer market.\nThough, with Microsoft\nadapting Windows for\nfoldable and dual screen\ndevices with Windows\n10X, the place for these\ndevices in our near future\nis guaranteed.\n\u201cSensors to\nmonitor the\ndriver\u2019s facial\nexpressions\nand body\nmovements\u201d\nacross the dashboard\nand a 360 degree im-mersive audio system\nthat\u2019s integrated into\nthe seat and other parts\nof the car. Furthermore,\njust like a Tesla, this\ncar would adapt to the\nfuture through regular\nover-the-cloud software\nSony Vision-S // Sony\nSamsung Odyssey G9 // Samsung Newsroom\n\u201cIt envelops\nyour entire\nhorizontal\nfield of vision\u201d\nmonster. Well, Alienware\nrefused to comment on\nthe internal specifications\nof the device. Furthermore, there was no say\non if or when this product\nwould hit the market.\nWith 5G connectivity and\ngame streaming services\nslowly propping up on\nthe horizon, it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time before we\nsee the evolution of both\non-the-go as well as PC\ngaming.\n\n"

I will only go\nover the U.S footprints in\nthe Middle East in the last\ntwo decades.\nAfghanistan\nSince the United\nState\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the\nU.S has spent 975 billion\nUS dollars on the war in\nAfghanistan. During the\neighteen years of their\npresence, the U.S military\nforces have dropped more\nthan 30,000 bombs on\nAfghanistan\u2019s soil. This\nhas caused the death\nof hundreds of Afghan\ncivilians every year. In\nfact, U.S air strikes have\nkilled more civilians in\nAfghanistan than terrorist\nforces. Despite all that,\nAfghanistan is still struggling with the presence\nof terrorists. It is hard to\ntell if the U.S invasion has\ndone the country any good\nat all.\nIraq\nThe U.S formed a coa-lition, including the UK,\nto invade Iraq in 2003 in\nan attempt to overthrow\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s regime\nas he was suspected of\nhaving weapons of mass\ndestruction. Of course,\nno such weapons were\never found, and the claims\nwere found to be bogus.\nAlmost all countries in\nthe coalition including the\nUK came to the consensus\nthat the Iraq war was a\nterrible mistake. Not only\ndid it incur billions of\ndollars in cost, it ruined\na country, spread hatred\nand violence in the world,\nand caused the death of\nhundreds of thousands\nof innocent civilians.\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal, the commander\nof Joint Special Forces\nwho fought Al-Qaida in\nIraq, acknowledged that\nU.S military\u2019s presence in\nIraq was the motivation\nfor the Al-Qaida insurgents to migrate to Iraq in\nthe first place.\nSyria\nThere is plenty of\nevidence on how the U.S\nhad been planning to\noverthrow Bashar Asad\u2019s\nregime. Leaked cables\nfrom U.S administration\nshow how they had been\nplanning to cause chaos\nin Syria since 2006, five\nyears before the war\nerupted. You can google\n\u2018Influencing the sarg in\nthe end of 2006\u2019 and read\none of such cables in\nWikileaks for yourself.\nThe book \u2018The Wikileaks\nFiles\u2019 provides plenty\nof evidence on how the\nUnited States government\nhas had an agenda of\npursuing imperialism in\nthe world in the name of\nnational security. The civil\nwar in Syria eventually\nled to millions of refugees\nand a total civilian death\ntoll of more than one\nhundred thousand.\nWhen power, imperialism and failed democracy meet\nWhen power, imperialism and failed democracy\nmeet, it will create a state\nvery much like George\nOrwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 dystopia.\nA state that sees its right\nThe M1 Abrams, a symbol of US imperialism // US Marines\nto run programs of mass\nsurveillance on its own\npeople. A state that\ncontrols the media, and so\ncontrols the truth. A state\nthat feeds people of that it\nconsiders a threat to their\nnational security appara-tus. It doesn\u2019t matter who\nthe enemy is, but there is\nalways an enemy. Orwell\nunderstood human nature\nquite well, \u201cpower is not\na means, it is an end\u201d.\nIf we fail to realise that\nsuch a state could actually\nexists, and would happily\nscrew others over to\nreach its ends, then I very\nmuch fear that Orwell\u2019s\nprophecy would not be far\nfrom truth: \u201cIf you want\na picture of the future,\nimagine a boot stamping\non a human face \u2013 for\never.\u201d\n\n"

A recent\nstudy led by Dr. Brianna\nVerigin at the University\nof Portsmouth has attempted to ascertain who\nthe \u201cgood\u201d liars are, how\nthey lie and why they are\nsuccessful.\nA \u201cgood\u201d liar might seem\nsomewhat oxymoronic.\nHowever, for Dr. Verigin\nand colleagues, they are\nsomeone who can successfully deceive, so that \u201cthe\nintended false-belief has\nbeen produced\u201d in their\naudience. The researchers\nconducted a survey of 194\npeople (mean age = 39,\nwith a 1:1 self-identifying\nmale:female ratio), in\nwhich each participant\nself-reported their 1) basic\npersonal information 2)\nlie frequency 3) deception\nstrategies and 4) ability\nto deceive successfully.\nUsing this final criterion,\nthe sample population was\ncategorised into \u201cpoor\u201d (n\n= 51), \u201cneutral\u201d (n = 75)\nand \u201cgood\u201d liars (n = 68).\nFrom this dataset, the\nresearchers found that\n\u201cgood\u201d liars were twice\nas likely to be men than\nwomen, with men representing roughly two thirds\nof \u201cgood\u201d liars. \u201cGood\u201d\nliars also lied more frequently than poorer liars,\nand therefore may be\nresponsible for a disproportionate number of lies\ntold in daily life. Previous\nstudies have indicated that\non average people lie at\nleast once per day. These\nrecent findings from Dr.\nVerigin and her team\nsupport the idea that the\nsubset of the population\nwho are more proficient\nliars (the \u201cgood\u201d liars of\nthis study) are driving up\nthis average and that not\nall people lie every day.\nIn the case of this sample,\nthe majority of lies were\nreported by only 40%\nof the tested population.\nAstoundingly, the six\nmost prolific liars (less\nthan 1% of the sample),\naccounted for 38.5% of\nthe lies, meanwhile 76\nparticipants (39% of the\nsample) reported telling\nno lies at all. The nature\nof the most common lies\nfrom those marked as\n\u201cgood\u201d liars are inconse-quential, or \u2018white\u2019 lies,\npredominantly to friends\nand colleagues (rather\nthan to employers or figures of authority).\nSo, how are good liars\nsuccessful? In this study\n\u201cgood\u201d liars reported a\npreference for lying face-to-face, and they succeed\nby keeping their lies clear,\nsimple and intertwined\nwith threads of truth.\nHowever, it is noted that\nthe self-reporting nature\nof the data collection is a\nshortfall of this study, and\nthat more research needs\nto be done, to look further\ninto \u201cgood\u201d liars\u2019ability to\nembed lies within truthful\ninformation. Anyway, in\nthe meantime, I wish you\nthe best of luck re: convincing your housemates\nyou didn\u2019t finish off the\nholiday snacks!\nResearchers from the University of Portsmouth have discovered that self-reported \u201cgood\u201d liars are (among\nother things) twice as likely to be men than women.\nLiar // Photini-Marie Knoyle\n\n"

I\u2019m pretty\nsure a significant chunk\nof our student body\ncurrently feel like they\nare facing their own\napocalyptic meltdown \u2013\nmuch more dire than the\nAustralian bushfires and\nthe oncoming eruption\nof WW3 \u2013 the colloquial\nname for which is, I\nbelieve, \u201cexam season\u201d.\nThere\u2019s a famous\ntale about the Russian\nengineers who braved\nthe radiation in order to\nmitigate the Chernobyl\ndisaster. Without them,\nthe meltdown would have\nresulted in a fallout zone\nboth larger and more\nirradiated. The details are\noften exaggerated, but\nnonetheless their heroism\nshould be remembered.\nI\u2019m positive, however,\nthat it pales in comparison to the courage with\nwhich a hungover student\nwho skipped 18 of their\ncourse\u2019s 26 lectures\nfaces down the prospect\nof spending three hours\nlocked into their personal\ntorture chamber \u2013 an\nexam hall.\nRather than downing\nvodka for so-called Dutch\ncourage, they grimace and\nchug down plastic bottles\nof water, trying to clear\ntheir heads of the boozy\ndaze remaining from the\nChristmas break \u2013 or\nperhaps just wishing for\nthe sweet embrace of\ndeath-by-burst-bladder.\nBut truly, their stoicism\nis made clearest in the\naftermath. They grimace\nat their mates and laugh\nit off, or head home to cry\nquietly to themselves.\nThere\u2019s two sides to\nthe above satirical bit of\nnonsense \u2013 the fact that\nmany students do not talk\nabout the problems they\nare facing, and the fact\nthat simultaneously we all\noverdramatise the trauma\nof exams. Let me explain\nthat dichotomy, before I\nget lynched for downplaying people\u2019s troubles.\nExams and coursework\nare stressful. They\u2019re\ngrueling, long, hard, and\noften the work that goes\ninto them is unrecognised.\nOne of the core pieces\nof advice I\u2019d give any\nstudent is to develop a way\nto value and take pride in\nyour own work, because\nyou sure as hell aren\u2019t\ngoing to receive that validation from elsewhere.\nThe sleep-deprived PhD\nstudent marking your lab\nreport is not going to grace\nyou with the approval\nyour teachers or parents\nmight have in school.\nAs a result, we all\ncomplain regularly and at\nlength about how awful\nour exams or courses\nare. That\u2019s entirely fair.\nBut I think that too often,\nthis mutual grouching\ndoes not actually adequately express our own\nindividual problems and\ncomplaints, which, being\nscience nerds more at\nhome with equations or\ncode than actual hUmAn\nEmOtIoNs, we\u2019re all\noften rather terrible at\ndealing with.\nThere isn\u2019t much\nof a culture of sharing\nfeelings at Imperial. You\ncan debate where that\nstems from all you like,\nbut that\u2019s the result \u2013 and\nit\u2019s well-documented.\nStudents often suffer in\nsilence, until they\u2019re in\na state and it\u2019s too late\nto provide meaningful\nsupport. Personally, I\ndistinctly recall my doctor\ntelling me she didn\u2019t need\nme to write down the\nSenior Tutor\u2019s email \u2013 she\nalready had it memorised\nfrom seeing so many students from my course in\nthe preceding week before\nexams.\nNot all of those students\nwould have been on the\n\u201cwellbeing radar\u201d before\nit gets to exams and they\ncrumble \u2013 because they\ndo not talk about their\nproblems.\nThe memes and jokes\nwe use to complain about\nour suffering can be great\ntools for sharing and alleviating some of the stress.\nThey give us a shared\nlanguage and shared ca-tharsis. But they can also\nmould the doctrine of our\nthinking and expression.\nWe default to saying them\nin the place of active and\nconsidered expressions\nof our own personal\nsuffering. Every person\u2019s\nstruggles are unique to\nthem, and come from their\nown individual factors,\npersonality, history, and\nso on.\nA joke which is generalised so as to be broadly\napplicable to everyone\ncannot, ever, accurately\ncommunicate how you\ntruly feel. Using it is like a\nsalve to soothe pain \u2013 it\u2019s\na symptomatic treatment\nthat doesn\u2019t actually\naddress or solve the core\nunderlying problem.\nIndeed, it means your own\nfeelings are left unarticu-lated, even to yourself,\njust as alleviating pain\ncan cause one to ignore a\nwound. They\u2019re an easy\npath to share in the mutual\nrelief every student feels\nby griping to one another\n\u2013 which is healthily therapeutic \u2013 but can also obstruct the understanding\nyou have of yourself and\nthat others have of you.\nIt\u2019s a weird sort of\nOrwellian Newspeak. By\ncommunicating only in a\nsmaller set of generalised,\npre-fabricated phrases,\njokes, memes, thoughts,\nwhatever, we can end up\nstruggling to adequately\nrecognise individual\npain, to provide individual support for individual\nproblems.\nIn the worst case\nscenario, this can be\ncatastrophic, leading to\nfeelings of isolation and\nloneliness \u2013 something\nis wrong, but we lack the\nability to articulate it,\nand lack the desire to do\nso when we can instead\ntemporarily soothe that\npain by bitching together\non IC Exposed.\nThis is not to be taken\nout of proportion. Memes\nare not going to destroy\nsociety as we know\nit \u2013 at least, not in this\nway, though a trip to r/\ncursedcomments or /b/\ndoes demonstrate the utter\ndegeneracy of the human\nrace.\nThere is, however, a\ndanger to be recognised.\nTalk about your problems,\nand where they come\nfrom, that are specific to\nyou and your feelings. Articulate them, and speak\nto friends, family, and\nsupport networks. Don\u2019t\njust laugh it off with an\nimage macro and believe\nyou are better after.\n2\n\n"

He gave a speech\nat an Anti Defamation\nLeague dinner, emploring\nFacebook and Twitter to\ncensor its content even\nfurther than presently. He\ncites surging hate crimes\nas evidence that social\nmedia is taking us away\nfrom the good old days\nwithout social media,\nwhere there was very\nlittle hate crime, with\nthe exception of the odd\nHolocaust, lynching and\nWorld War.\nSo without going overboard on the mockery,\nbecause I\u2019m certain to\nlose that battle with a man\nwho is admittedly a fine\ncomedian, let\u2019s get into the\nauthoritarian bits of the\nspeech which I take issue\nwith. Sacha says that his\nproposals are \u2018not limiting\nfree speech\u2019 because\nFacebook and Twitter are\nprivate companies and\nthe first amendment only\nprevents governments\nfrom infringing on free\nspeech. This is valid, were\nit not for a point later in\nhis speech where Sacha\npleads to \u2018let our elected\nrepresentatives \u2026 have at\nleast some say\u2019. Does that\nsound like the government\nto you? There are very\ngood reasons why the\ngovernment should not\ninfringe on free speech,\nand it is regrettable that\nthe British government\ndoes not hold this right\nin so high a regard as\nthe Americans. Allowing\ngovernments to take\neffectively in the past, is\nnot a recipe for liberation,\nrather a path to unlicensed\nauthoritarianism. Let\u2019s not\nforget that governments,\ni.e. the embodiment of\nmajority rule, frequently\nexalt the wrong \u2018facts\u2019 as\nindisputable. WMDs in\nIraq, Slavery in Empires,\nEconomic Denial in 1929,\nFascism in the early 20th\nCentury: all government\nsanctioned actions based\non the accepted truth at\nthe time. People should be\nallowed to argue with the\nstate backed truth; who\nknows, it might turn out\nthat Jeffrey Epstein didn\u2019t\nstrangle himself with thin\nair?\nHe reckons it would be\npretty simple for Twitter\nto implement an algorithm\nto filter out the \u2018racists\u2019\nand \u2018homophobes\u2019 with\nthe only downside being\nthat \u2018it would eject some\nprominent politicians\u2019.\nHe goes on to say \u2018maybe\nthat wouldn\u2019t be such a\nbad thing\u2019. Aside from\nthe dystopian reality of\nelected officials passing\nlegislation to force social\nmedia to ban other elected\nofficials, Baron Cohen\nmisses one unfortunate\npoint. Does he think that\nthese algorithms will be\nable to determine that his\njoke song \u2018throw the Jews\ndown the well\u2019 is in fact\nsides of \u2018whether the\nHolocaust happened or\nnot\u2019 are not equally valid.\nThat is a truth that he, I\nand most other people\nshare. But to close off\npublic discourse for those\nwho are provably wrong\nsimply pushes them back\nto their living room racism\nwhere no-one can see it\nuntil it is too late. I want\nmy racists out in the open,\nwhere they can be heckled\nand proven wrong. I ask\nSacha, and anyone else\nwho might think to lobby\nfor more censorship, to\nreconsider, and think\nwhether they really want\nto live in a world where\nevery meme on Facebook\nSacha Baron Cohen // Joella Marano\n\u201cAllowing\ngovernments\nto take\ncontrol of the\nnarrative is\nnot a recipe of\nliberation\u201d\na joke?

In this adaptation\nby the National Youth\nTheatre (NYT), several\nchanges to the plot and\nsetting have been made.\nThe most obvious setting\nchange was that instead of\nthe traditional Athens of\nAncient Greece, the NYT\nversion was set in the\nslightly more run-down\nAthens-on-Sea, a stereotypical seaside town, gone\nto the dogs over years\nof neglect. The scene\nwas set with a hilarious\nmodern introduction of a\nson harassing his mother\nfor ice cream on the\nbeach. However, this brief\ndalliance with modernity\nseemed no more than an\nafterthought as the rest of\nthe story was carried out\nentirely in Shakespearean\nEnglish.\nStraight from the off,\nan atypical choice was\nto cast Helena, usually\na female role, as a man.\nJamie Foulkes was a convincing Helena who had\nclear chemistry with the\nother three lovers of the\ntangled love quadrangle -Lysander, Demetrius and\nHermia. Oberon and Puck\nlurked in the background\nof the play. Bede Hodgkinson convinced as the\nauthoritative fairy king,\nordering his minion this\nway and that. I am afraid\nthatPuckinthisadaptation\nleft a little to be desired.\nAs opposed to the usual\nmischievous knave that\ndelights in the trickery of\nthe night, this Puck (Ella\nDacres) seemed to resent\nthe orders from on high\nto sow discord against the\nFairy Queen and the Athenians. Her serious manner\nwas incongruent with the\nlight-hearted nature of\nthe rest of the production.\nSpeaking of jarring, the\ncast regularly broke\ninto well-choreographed\ndance, accompanied\nby rhythmic thumping\nmusic. Although I have\nno objection to the inclusion of dance in a play,\nthe music was often so\nloud that it and obscured\ndialogue, not to mention\nthe tendency of the dance\nsegments to suddenly\nappear without warning.\nA key part of any\nsuccessful Midsummer\nNight\u2019s Dream hinges on\nthe casting of Bottom. The\ndeluded egomaniac that\nmakes Bottom so much\nfun to watch, as well as,\nI imagine, play, was\nwonderfully embodied by\nJemima Mayala. The rest\nof the of the Athenian\nActors Guild were classically comic. I have never\nbefore seen such a well-built and smooth-moving\nWall as that provided by\nJordan Ford Silver.\nOverall, I feel that this\nwas a fresh, modern and\nwell-executed adaptation.\nIf only they had provided\na more playful Puck and\ndanced a little less, I\nwould have enjoyed it a\nlot more.\nT\nhe Wolf of Wall\nStreet is the latest\nimmersive offering from director\nAlexander Wright, based\non the 2013 film about\nunscrupulous stockbroker\nJordan Belfort.

Once the\ninitial novelty wears off,\nhowever, what promises\nto be a high-powered\nevening of entertainment\nquickly fizzles out.\nThe actors do their best,\nslipping into multiple\nroles and accents to\nmaintain momentum.\nUnfortunately, they\u2019re all\none-dimensional carica-tures, a casualty of seeing\nonly brief interactions as\nwe\u2019re herded from one\nscene to the next. Oliver\nTilney (Jordan Belfort)\nmakes a cartoon-worthy\nstockbroker gone bad, and\nactress MJ Lee impressed\nif only with the sheer\nnumber of different roles\nshe took on. The dialogue,\nwhich starts up like Punch\nand Judy once we crowd\ninto each room, feels\nwooden and we have little\nagency to deviate from\nour predetermined path.\nDespite the scripted bits\nof audience interaction \u2013\nstuffing money into duffel\nbags, smuggling pills\nin condoms \u2013 it fails to\nengage.\nEven our presence in\nthe show is questionable.\nAs newly-hired employ-ees, it makes little sense\nfor us to be flown en\nmasse to Geneva for Belmont\u2019s business meeting,\nand all pretence of realism\nis dropped when we\ninexplicably end up in\nBelmont\u2019s family home\nwitnessing his domestic\nargument with his wife.\nThe darker themes of the\nplay were completely\nundercut by the audience\n\u2013 the wild card of immer-sive theatre. It was hard\nto concentrate on Stratton\ntaking an overdose with\ntipsy, giggly City workers\nhorsing around behind\nhim, and the dismal image\nof Stratton\u2019s wife sitting\nalone on the stairs was\ncheapened by people\ntittering at her as they\nwalked by.\nWhen you think about\nit, what is the point of\nturning the drug- and\nfraud-fuelled world of\nStratton Oakmont into an\nimmersive experience?\nDespite the show depicting domestic violence\nand an account of Belfort\nsexually assaulting an\nair stewardess, there is\nlittle point in pretending\nthat this is a moral tale of\nwarning. Rather, for \u00a360\na pop, the show enables\nattendees to revel in the\nchance to say \u201cf**ck\nthe poor\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s too\nf**cking easy to get away\nwith sexual assault if\nyou\u2019re rich\u201d.

This is an\nasinine decision which\nwill only spur further\nviolence in the world.\nThere are multiple\ndimensions to this event\nwhich makes one have\nsecond thoughts about\nwhether the U.S is helping\nto establish peace in the\nworld, or is itself the\nbiggest threat to world\npeace and liberal democ-racy. The events of the last\nfew weeks suggest that it\nis the latter.\nIn defence of the U.S.\nactions, U.S secretary of\nstate Mike Pompeo stated\nthat the assassination of\nGeneral Soleimani was an\nact of defence. The U.S\nsuspected that Soleimani was plotting attacks\nagainst U.S diplomats\nand soldiers, despite the\nlack of any evidence to\nback such claims. Does\nthis mean anyone can\ngo around killing people\nand justify it as an act\nof defence against unforeseen future attacks?\nWouldn\u2019t the world be\nchaos if everyone justified\ncrime that way?\nAdditionally, the\nmajority of U.S. congress\nmembers were kept in the\ndark regarding Trump\u2019s\ndecision to assassinate\nGeneral Soleimani. This\nis a clear violation of\ndemocracy for a decision\nwhich could have global\nand long-term conse-quences, not just for\nthe Americans, but the\nwhole human population.\nDemocratic processes are\nthere to put a check on\nexecutive power. When\nthey are not allowed to\nact, tyranny is the result.\nThirdly, as part of the\nNATO coalition in Iraq,\nthe British leaders were\nalso not informed about\nthe attack, an act which\nhas dragged the British\ngovernment into a matter\nthey did not consent to.\nLastly, the attack was a\nviolation of Iraq\u2019s sover-eignty, territorial integrity\nand international law. It\u2019s\nlike inviting your friend\nto your house and he stabs\nposes the greatest threat to\nworld peace in the present\nand will continue to do so\nfor many years to come.\nThere are three main\nreasons for this (a) United\nStates by far has the most\npowerful military in the\nworld, (b) United States\nwants to have total control\nover the affairs of the\nworld, and (c) the crippled\ndemocratic system in the\nUnited States allows men\nlike Donald Trump to rule\nthe country. History has\ntaught us that too much\npower brings forth corruption and death.

The United States\nhas 11 aircraft carriers in\nservice, more than what\nthe rest of the world has\naltogether, and has 72\noperating nuclear-pow-ered submarines, more\nthan what Russia, France,\nthe UK and China have\ncombined. The U.S also\nhas about 800 military\nbases in 40 countries. The\nUK comes second on this\nlist having military bases\nin 13 countries only. The\nU.S military also accounts\nfor 60 million tonnes of\ncarbon dioxide emission\nper year. That is more\nthan the total carbon\ndioxide produced by most\ncountries.

And as much as\nwe love to complain as\nImperial students, we are\nplaced in an extremely\nconvenient position.\nLocated in Hyde Park,\nit\u2019s a short walk way from\nthe South Kensington\ncampus. The huge Ferris\nwheel guides tourist to\ntheir destination once they\nleave the station like the\nnorth star. From the right\nbuilding here, you can see\nit from a window, calling\nto you to give yourself\na well-deserved study\nbreak.\nI can\u2019t keep going\nwithout mentioning that it\nis completely free to enter.\nEven if you aren\u2019t one for\nthrill-seeking rides and\nriggedgames,justwalking\naround and looking at the\namazing lights and attractions can lift any Grinch\u2019s\nmood and get you into\nthe Christmas spirit. And\nyet, I know people who\nhave never been. Every\nyear they let the fair pass\nthem by. So this is my\nfinal attempt to let people\nknow about what they\u2019ve\nbeen missing the only way\nI know how: food.\nIf you aren\u2019t a parent\nof 4, trying not to lose\ntrack of your kids, the\nmost likely type of food\noption you will go for are\nthe stalls. Yeah they have\nproper restaurants that you\ncan book ahead and all but\nI feel that there should be\nsome sort of spontaneity\nwhen you come to a place\nlike this.\nWinter Wonderland has\ntheir own stalls spread all\nover the site so you will be\nable to bag yourself something the second you feel\npeckish from any section.\nHyde Park in December\ncan get quite chilly so\nthey\u2019ve got a bunch of\noptions to help you stay\nwarm and keep you going.\nJust make sure you don\u2019t\npuke it all up on one of the\nrides if you manage to be\nable to afford that.\nThe options at their\nstalls are pretty much\nthe same every year. The\nchurros are an iconic\nstaple. If you didn\u2019t get\na picture with a bag of\nchurros, did you even go\nto Winter Wonderland?\nThey came out as a fiver\nfor a bag of them with\njust sugar as the topping.\nThey are really generous\nwith the toppings (though\nwith prices like that they\nare definitely still making\na comfortable profit). You\nleave with a measly 5\nstick of varous sizes. It\u2019s\nno where close to a meal\nbut the sweet content will\nmake you feel queasy\nafter it all the same.\nThe donuts are a\npersonal guilty pleasure of\nmine. They are the freshly\ncooked ones that you find\nat amusement parks so\nthey remind me of the\ntimes when I would go\nto Thorpe Park or Chessington with my family - a\nmuch simpler time.

One\ncannot help but feel that\nto many readers, Little\nWomen offered a glimpse\nof country life\u2019s rosy\ntwilight, as an increasing\nnumber of Americans\nemigrated to cities.\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s interpretation frames these\npoles of urbane adulthood\nand provincial infancy\nmore sharply by chopping\nup Little Women\u2019s\ntimeline. The audience is\nthrown between two narratives at will, \u00e0 la Pulp\nFiction. This effectively\nheightens the film\u2019s emotional potency, drawing\nout bittersweet pangs as\nwe cut from an adult Jo\n(Saoirse Ronan) wrestling\nwith mortality and indi-viduality, to an endearing\nMarch family \u2018play\u2019.\nMuch of the film,\nfocusing on country life,\nis framed with warm\npallets and snug camera\nwork, literally enveloping\nthe viewer in the family\ngoings on of the Little\nWomen. The result is a\nsatisfying and pleasant\ncinematic experience,\nthat comforts rather than\nchallenges.\nStandout cine-matographic moments\ncome in twin beach\nscenes: one sees the sisters\nand friends frolicking on a\nwarm summer\u2019s day, the\ncamera wonders loosely,\nlike the sea birds it traces.\nThe other depicts Beth\n(Eliza Scanlen) struggling with scarlet fever\ncomplications, her figure\ndistant against sheer white\nsands and skies, creating a\nmuted, bleak moment.\nAlexandre Desplat\ntakes responsibility for\nLittle Women\u2019s music, a\nsomewhat safe choice,\ngiven his credentials: The\nShape of Water, Argo, The\nGrand Budapest Hotel,\nand even the final Harry\nPotter feature his deft\ncompositional hand. This\nwas in fact the first film\nwhose score I enjoyed so\nmuch I actually sought it\nout for repeat listening.\nWhile removed from its\ncinematic context, the\ncomposition is perhaps\nmore quaint than awe\ninspiring, it succeeded in\nenhancing my experience.\nLittle Women\u2019s cast\nis enough to turn any\nHollywood producer\ngreen with envy, while\nEmma Watson (Meg)\nand Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\n(Laurie) provide strong\nsupport, it is the crackling\nsibling rivalry delivered\nby Saorise Ronan (Jo)\nand Florence Pugh (Amy)\nwhich really sparkles.\nWith by far the meatiest\nstory arcs, packed with\nconflict, sacrifice and\nbeyond that, passion,\nAmy and Jo are incredibly\nsympathetic, their actors\nbreathing life into the\nwhole March family.\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s interpretation of Little Women\nis well worth a watch\nif you haven\u2019t already,\nand for any viewers\nwho have read this far,\nperhaps a second. All the\ningredients of a great film\nare here, and while it will\nnot revolutionise the film\nindustry, Little Women\nwill warm your heart, the\nperfect tonic for exam\nseason.\nMeg, Amy, Jo and, finally, Beth: our Little Women // Sony Pictures Releasing\nFILM\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nDir: Greta Gerwig.

The cloaks\nwere displayed alongside\nfacts about the materials\nthe litter is comprised of\n\u2013 plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate, paper,\nand aluminium.\nThe cloaks were previously worn to the Lord\nMayor\u2019s Show on 9th\nNovember, at which the new\nLord Mayor is sworn in\neach year. The procession\nthrough the city features\nfloats and marches from\nmilitary detachments,\nschools, companies, and\nother institutions. \u00c1inne\nwas invited to join the City\nof London Corporation\u2019s\nRecycling in the City\nfloat, at which she wore a\nprevious piece \u2013 the \u2018Earth\nGown\u2019, constructed from\ncling film, polystyrene,\nbubble wrap, and other recyclable materials \u2013 while\nothers who had worked\nwith her wore the four\ncloaks. The nature of the\nevent inspired the choice\nto develop ceremonial\ncloaks, \u00c1inne says.\nEach piece was made\nusing the certified cra-dle-to-cradle method,\nwhich approaches the\ndesign process by modelling the used materials as\nnutrients circulating in a\nhealthy metabolism. The\nmethod encourages industry and product creation to\nprotect and enrich ecosystems in their processes,\nfitting with the thematic\nof the cloaks themselves.\nOn this methodology,\n\u00c1inne said \u201cI feel this\ncertification should be\nmandatory for all design.\nEach of the four cloaks\nis a story of a product of\nmany companies \u2013 flattening the 250 tin cans with\na five-kilogramme weight\nfelt as though I was part\nof the destruction of the\nmanufacturing process,\nto tell the story of its\nway from the street to the\ngrave.\u201d\nThe exhibition was\npart of The Earth and Me\n(TEAM) project \u00c1inne\nhas developed alongside\nthe Institute, which aims\nto combine visual art\nwith a scientific aspect \u2013\nnamely the chemistry of\nthe periodic table and the\nelements \u2013 to emphasise\nhumanity\u2019s relationship\nwith the earth and how to\nbetter care for it.\nThe project looks at\nthe 92 natural chemical\nelements contained in the\nThe cloaks were made of recyclable litter collected in London // Thomas Angus\nImperial Artist-in-Residence Presents Exhibition\nISSUE 1738\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTheexhibition,titledTheEarthandMe:LitterCloaks\u2013WearingtheEarth,createdgarmentsmadeoflittersourced\nfrom Corporation of London street sweepers\nbiomes of the land, air,\nand water of the Earth,\n64 of which are also\ncontained in the human\nbody, and uses art and\nscience to educate and\nraise awareness of that\nrelationship and the (im)\nbalances between each\nelement \u2013 for example, an\nimbalance of cadmium as\nit's overloaded into water\ncauses the itai-itai disease.\nThus far, TEAM has\ncreated a periodic table\nusing the colours of ores,\nusing specimens online,\nknown as the TEAM\nPeriodic Table, which will\nthen be matched to specific pigments in February to\ncreate the TEAM Pigment\nPalette of the Periodic\nTable. \u00c1inne then plans\nto create 92 paintings, one\nfor each natural chemical\nelement, using art to communicate the science and\nthe relationship between\nthose 92 and the 64 comprising the human body.\nAs she puts it: \u201cwhen you\npollute land, air, and water\nthrough human activity,\nwe pollute ourselves!\u201d\nFelix will follow up\nwith an interview with\n\u00c1inne in next week\u2019s issue.\n3\nRent Negotiations\nAs a brief recap: every\nfive years, the Union and\nCollege negotiate the rent\nprice in halls. This year,\nthe College proposed a\nmodel they described\nas \u201cbreak-even\u201d, which\nwould see a 12.2% overall\nincrease in the price of\nhalls. The Union Council\nvoted to reject this model,\ndisputing both the steep\nincrease and whether the\nmodel counted as \u201cbreakeven\u201d given that new\ncosts were included and\nthe value of the asset was\nnot taken into account.\nSince this decision, the\nUnion has continued to\nmeet with the College\u2019s\nCampus Services division\nunder whose remit this\ndiscussion falls. The\nUnion President has said\nthat Campus Services had\nbeen very open-minded\nin their discussions, and\nhelpful in providing information when requested.\nAs of yet, no further decisions have been made.\nEthical Investment\nAs a brief recap: the\nCollege was revealed in\n2017/18 to have several\nmillion pounds invested in\ncompanies with dubious\nethical track records,\nsuch as fossil fuels,\narms, and pharmaceutical\ncompanies. There has\nbeen a growing pressure\nfor the College to assess\nits investment portfolio\nand account for ethical\nconcerns. This culminated\nwith the submission \u2013 and\npassing \u2013 of an ethical investment paper at College\nCouncil, written by the\nUnion President, the\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services), and the\nEthics and Environment\nOfficer, which sought to\nestablish a working group\nto investigate.\nThe Socially Responsible Investment (SRI)\nPolicy Working Group set\nup as a result of the paper\nhas met twice already this\nterm, working at a fast\npace due to the short turnaround time on feeding\nback findings to College\nCouncil \u2013 which are due\nin mid-February.\nThey are in the process\nof consulting with various\nexperts in the areas of\nclimate and investment\npolicy.

I guess?\nR\nising from\nthe UK\u2019s\ncriminally un-derappreciated\ngrime scene with his\nWicked Skengman freestyle series in 2014,\nStormzy was one of my,\nand many of my peer\u2019s,\nfirst introductions to\nGrime. Lyrically excellent\nand with a friendly charm,\nStormzy was a breath of\nfresh air in London\u2019s dark\ntake on rap. With drill\nmusic, and associated\nkillings peppering the\nnews, and knife crime at\na high, Stormzy\u2019s positive\noutlook, more present\nhere than ever is much\nneeded.\nHis first record, Gang\nSings and Prayer, was the\nfirst Grime album to top\nthe UK charts, winning\ncritical acclaim and a\nBrit award for best UK\nalbum to boot, to say it is\na hard act to follow is an\nunderstatement. Pressure\nat #Merky Records\nmust have eased then,\nwhen \u2018Vossi Bop\u2019, his\n2nd record\u2019s lead single\nbecame the rapper\u2019s first\nto reach #1 on the UK\nsingles chart, with more\nstreams first week than\nany other rapper in the\nUK\u2019s history. The track\nshowcased much of what\nhad taken Stormzy this\nfar, namely a relaxation\nof Grime\u2019s syncopated\nsensibilities, in favour of\nmore conventional and\nimportantly danceable\ngrooves, while retaining\nthe flexible, rhythmically\nengaging flow and British\nwit which keeps fans of\nthe genre coming back.\nHow could \u2018Vossi Bop\u2019\nnot have been a hit?\nAllegedly, in a private\nlistening Ed Sheeran,\npop sovereign, advised\nStormzy as much.\nMerky\u2019s lyrical skills\nare not wasted on idle\nboasts on Heavy is the\nHead. Well, mostly not,\nhis brags instead take\nthe Kendrick Lamar\nroute, focusing on facts,\nhis achievements which\nplace him a cut above his\n\u201ccompetitors\u201d, (and in the\nprocess of course, earning\nhim the crown that weighs\nupon him so heavy) this\ncolour isn\u2019t the most\nflattering, but Stormzy\nis more than entitled to a\ndegree of snobbery.\nStormzy\u2019s writing is\nwarranting of criticism\nhere, certainly, many great\nrecords have less technical flows, compensating\nwith intelligent rhymes\nand witty wordplay, little\nof this compensation\nis apparent on H.I.T.H.\nInstead, the listener is\nmet with lacklustre, one\nsyllable rhyme schemes\n\u201csmoke/close/toke/coat/\nadults/boat/GOAT/Dope/\nHulk/Broke\u201d, with middle\nof the road instrumentals\nand decent flows, the LP\u2019s\n\u2018hardest\u2019 tracks come to\nless than the sum of their\nparts, but are by no means\npoor.\nOn other tracks,\nStormzy takes us behind\nthe throne of grime, examining the struggles and\nimpossible expectations\nthat accompany modern\ncelebrity, his mental health\nand the community he\ncame from. These softer,\ndistinctly more melodic\ntracks deliver well when\nbacked by detail, like\n\u2018Superheroes\u2019\u2019 sample of\nchildren\u2019s TV show Tracy\nBeaker, which adorns the\ntrack with nostalgia very\nwell. \u2018Rachel\u2019s Little\nBrother\u2019 and \u2018Do better\u2019\nhowever, lack the visceral\nvulnerability that would\nallow them to hit their\nmark.\nInstrumentals follow\nthe same trend: simple,\ndanceable, but with\nbarely enough spice to\ndistinguish them from US\nconsumer-grade beats.\nThere is no doubt that\nthey will land the album\nmuch popularity, tracks\nlike \u2018Big Michael\u2019, \u2018Pop\nBoy\u2019 and \u2018Lessons\u2019 are\neminently listenable but\nachieve this by sacrificing\nsome of what would merit\nmore sincere appreciation\nor praise.\nHeavy is the Head, is\nfar from a bad album, but\nthere is little that could\npit it against classics of\nthe genre like Boy in the\nCorner and Playtime is\nOver or even more recent\nworks like Grey Area,\nNothing Great About\nBritain and Integrity,\nwhich readers are advised\nto listen to instead of this.\nStormzy\nvs\nWiley\nThat green in the background is really nice // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nFELIX ISSUE 1738\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Ze\u00f1el Label:\nIndependent For Fans Of:\nSnarky Puppy, Kamasi\nWashington, Good music.\n6 minutes\nBubble Leaves\nBubble Leaves has great art to boot // Wilkins\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Stormzy Label:\n#Merky Records. Top\nTracks: Wiley Flow; Vossi\nBop, Lessons; For Fans Of:\nSkepta; Bugzy Malone. 54\nminutes.\nHeavy is the Head\nZ\ne\u00f1el is a south\nLondon based\njazz trio, inc o r p o r a t i n g\nmore spacious, brass driven sound, forged by legends like Theon Cross,\nThe Ezra Collective or\nYussef Kamaal. Instead\nthe listener is met with a\nbubbly and precious synth\ngroove, interjected with\ncoy breaks as the tune\nbuilds momentum before\nmelting before the listeners ears, giving way to a\nsecond riff.\nHere, delay drenched\ntrumpet pierces the synth\ndriven soundscape as tensions build once again into\na galaxy of sound, constel-lated with streaks of trumpet and drum fills, crafting\nan atmosphere guaranteed\nto consume your world. A\nbrief reprise of it\u2019s opening\ntheme suddenly rounds\nthe track out, leaving the\nlistener thoroughly diso-riented.\n\u2018Bubble Leaves\u2019 is well\nworth a listen for any\njazz fans wondering\nwhat the future of jazz\nmight sound like, with it\u2019s\nunique synths, colourful\ntrumpetery and ingenious\ngrooves, there is plenty\nhere to enjoy.\nstrong elements of\nfusion and electronic to\nbring a unique flavour to\nLondon\u2019s eclectic melting\npot.

Wiley, often labelled the \u2018Godfather\nof Grime\u2019, rose to prominence in the early 00\u2019s with his crew Roll Deep. Continuing to produce singles and chart strongly into the 10s as Grime became more\npalatable to the mainstream, he has found himself in somewhat of a social media black hole, seemingly unable to hold himself back from insulting fellow\nrappers on twitter, most notably calling Drake a \u201cculture vulture\u201d.\nSome back and forth, circulating around Wiley\u2019s brother, as well as Stormzy\u2019s perceived \u201cwatering down\u201d of grime, and collaboration with Ed Sheeran\n(which Wiley has also done), has cumulated in a series of \u2018diss tracks\u2019. \u2018Eediyat Skengman\u2019 1 and 2 from Wiley\u2019s camp followed Stormzy\u2019s single \u2018Wiley Flow\u2019.\nStormzy clapped back quickly with \u2018disappointed\u2019, in which he attempts to take the higher ground. While Stormzy\u2019s instrumental and flow are slightly\nstronger, there is yet to emerge a clear winner.\nEntertaining as the feud is, one cannot help but feel that the truest line to have come from this conflict is Stormzy\u2019s: \u201cHeavy is the Head is out now, so go\nbuy it\u201d. The pair have yet to justify their media attention (and the accompanying sales) with any interesting writing, instead resting largely on cheap swipes.\n13\n\n"

Sort\nof. More like moderately\ninformed.\nWhat are quants?\nThey\u2019re people who can\nComputer Geeks who earn more than you: Quants\nunderstand and build\ncomplicated mathematical models that will in\nsome way be used to\nmake more money and\nperhaps mitigate risk.\nThose who work directly\nwith the traders are front\noffice quants and those\nwho sit in the dusty room\nin the basement are back\noffice quants. There are,\nof course, different subcategories such algorithmic trading quants, risk\nmanagement quants and\nothers, but by and large\nthese guys are fundamentally quite similar.\nAs you can imagine,\nthe pay for these positions\ntend to be quite high.\nThose working in front\noffice positions are better\ncompensated than their\npeers in back office, but\nhave more stressful and\ndemanding roles.\nFor example, someone\nworking as a back office\nquant will probably have\nthe title quantitative re-searcher. Their job could\nbe to validate statistical\nmodels and analytics\nprograms or to research\nand analyse market trends\namong other things. Being\nin the back office may\nsound quite dull to some\nbut it is essential to a bank.\nThe more exciting role is\nworking as a front office\nquant, typically termed\nquantitative trader. Here\nyou\u2019ll be working directly\nwith colleagues on the\ntrading floor coming up\nwith some fancy pants\nalgorithm that\u2019s going to\nmake the trader a lot of\nmoney. As you move up\nthe ranks, you\u2019ll usually\nspecialise in a particular\narea \u2013 derivatives pricing,\nquantitative investment\nstrategies, algo trading\netc.\nBecoming a Quant\nTo be a quant you need\nto have Big Brain, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean everyone\nwho can do it should do it.\nThe sort of problems you\nface and the work you do\nis quite narrowly focused.\nYou\u2019re not going to meet\nwith management or talk\nto shareholders and there\nFELIX\n\u201c... you\u2019ll\nbe working\ndirectly with\ncolleagues on\nthe trading\nfloor coming\nup with some\nfancy pants\nalgorithm\nthat\u2019s going\nto make the\ntrader a lot of\nmoney. \u201d\nisn\u2019t much opportunity to\nmove to positions where\nyou manage people. This\nis however compensated for with very large\nsalaries. If you\u2019re serious\nabout becoming a quant,\nbe sure that you actually\nlike the work that it entails\nand aren\u2019t doing it for the\nmoney. That being said,\nhow do you become a\nquant?\nTypically, they have\nan extensive background\nin statistics, computer\nscience, or something\nclosely related. PhD\u2019s\namong quants are not\nuncommon. If you\u2019re\nlooking to get ahead of the\ncompetition, you might\nwant to consider further\nstudies. Some quants\ntend to focus more on the\nmathematical side of their\nwork whilst others lean\ntowards the data modelling and programming\nside.\nBanks prefer that all\nfuture quants have some\nbackground or at least\nfamiliarity with program-ming, according to the\nGoldman Sachs strat who\nrejected me. Not bitter\nabout it. I swear. A \u2018strat\u2019\nis a mixture of someone\nwho works in structuring,\nquantitative finance and\nengineering in a bank.\nPerhaps there\u2019ll be an\n\u201cWith the aid\nof Python...\nmaking\nsome quants\nobsolete. It\u2019s\nthe ones who\nonly push out\n20 lines of\ncode in a day\nthat Barclays\nare looking to\naxe\u201d\n\u201cTo be a\nquant you\nneed to have\nBig Brain ....\nPhD\u2019s among\nquants are not\nuncommon\u201d\narticle on this at some\npoint in the future.\nThe future of Quants\nThere seems to be a\nlot of discussion about the\nfuture of quants. They\u2019re\nhot right now but that\ncould easily change in the\nfuture. Go back 3 decades\nwhen Microsoft Excel was\nintroduced into banks. The\ntraders no longer needed\nto send a ton of numbers\nto the guy in the back\nroom to crunch because\nthey could do it them-selves. This resulted in a\ndecrease of the number\nof back and middle office\nemployees as they were\nnow obsolete. Apply the\nsame sort of scenario to\nthe modern day. Take a\ncash equities project for\nexample, traders used to\nhave to ask quants to do\nbasic post trade analysis\nfor them. With the aid of\nPython, traders can do this\nthemselves in turn making\nsome quants obsolete.\nThis is exactly what\u2019s\nhappening at Barclays. Of\ncourse, most quants have\nsignificant amounts of\nother, more complex work\nto do and these guys will\nprobably be around for a\nwhile. It\u2019s the ones who\nonly push out 20 lines of\ncode in a day that Barclays\nare looking to axe.\nThe best quant jobs are\nprobably not in banks but\non the buy-side. So if this\narticle has inspired you to\nbecome a quant well then\nyou should look to work\nin a quantitative fund like\nTwo Sigma or Citadel.\nHere, there\u2019s much\nmore of an opportunity\nfor you develop as a quant\nand they pay astronomical\namounts. These roles\nhowever, are ridiculously\ncompetitive but we go to\nImperial so we must be\nable to get any job we\nwant right? Right..?\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

    "content": "Promising EarlyAccess Roguelikes:ABrief Overview\nof Hades and Noita\nGAMES\nDharshan\nBalasirishwaron\nGames Writer\nB\nrowsing the\nSteam store\none day, I came\nacross two\nintriguing roguelikes. Just\nas Dead Cells brought\nsomething fresh and fun\nto the genre in its fast-paced Metroidvania style\ngameplay and iterative\napproach to difficulty,\nHades and Noita bring\nsome unique ideas to the\ntable and have certainly\npiqued my interest.\nHades is the latest\nfrom Supergiant Games,\nthe indie team behind\nBastion, Transistor and\nPyre. Hades follows suit\nwith Supergiant Games\u2019\nstyle of dropping a player\ninto their meticulously\ncrafted world and feeding\nthem options to play\nthe way they want. You\nplay as Zagreus, son of\nHades. Equipped with just\na sword at first, you\u2019re\nthrown into Tartarus, the\nlowest floor of Hell, and\nare left to take on your\nmission - to escape the\nUnderworld. The music\nstarts as you descend,\nand you\u2019re left to absorb\nthe tense atmosphere surrounding the lavish House\nof Hades.\nAs you progress\nthrough chambers by\nslashing through shades\nin gloriously fluid and fast\npaced combat, you\u2019ll find\nmyriad ways to buff-up\nand determine your\nplaystyle for the current\nrun. The game is rich in\ndialogue and charming\ncharacters. It doesn\u2019t just\nhand you buffs silently,\nyour relatives, the Gods\nof Olympus aid you with\na choice of unique boons\nand converse at every\nfree moment. Even better,\nthe dialogue doesn\u2019t get\nstale as the Gods will\nmake comments specific\nto who you\u2019ve met and\nwhat you\u2019ve done so\nfar \u2013 a trait shared by\nthe entire cast. Sisyphus,\namong other characters,\naids you mid-run, giving\na handsome amount of\nhealth or gold, or levelling\nup some of your boons,\namong other gifts. Even\nthe bosses have several\nunique lines, all voice\nacted, with more lines\nadded every update. The\nattention to detail in the\ncharacters and their inter-actions, such as Hypnos\n(the embodiment of sleep)\nthat annoys everyone\naround with his snarky\nquips, is what makes\nHades so special and\nmemorable, .\nWhile the limited\nchamber layouts do get\nrepetitive at times, the\ncombat options help keep\nthe game fresh. Other\nthan boons and gifts, your\nweapon itself can change.\nThis isn\u2019t just changing\nbetween the sword and\nthe unlockable spear,\nshield, bow and railgun;\nthere\u2019s further diversification of playstyle given\nby unlockable variants of\nthese weapons - though\nthere\u2019s a significant grind\nrequired to unlock some\nvariants. During runs, you\ncan power up your weapon\nwith unique upgrades\nusing one of Daedalus\u2019\nhammers; one run my\nspear would be bouncing\nbetween enemies with\neach throw, and another it\nwould land with a blast for\nAOE damage! Combined\nwith boons like poison\ndamage and critical hit\nchances, my tactics each\nrun changed drastically.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s\nkeepsakes with their own\neffects that can be changed\nbetween each level of Hell\nand purchasable upgrades\nfor Zagreus himself at his\nmirror before a run. All in\nall, Hades is a masterful\nmixture of addictive,\nengaging gameplay and\ncaptivating storytelling.\nLeaving behind the\nbeautifully drawn art and\nlandscapes of Hades,\nwe move into the pixel\nwizardry of Noita.\nPlopped down into a\nrandomly generated\nworld, you\u2019re simply\ntaught how to move, kick\nand view your inventory\nwhich includes a water\nflash and two wands \u2013 one\nfires small but unlimited\nbolts, and the other fires\nup to 3 bombs. Anyone\nwho has played the\nphysics simulation game\nPowder knows how much\nfun it is to mess around\nin a pixel-based physics\nengine. Noita makes the\nmost of this, starting by\nplacing torches all around\nto be shot open, raining\nfire down onto wooden\nstructures to burn for\nthe player\u2019s pleasure.\nThen you find your first\nnon-default wand, and\neventually make your way\nto the bottom of the level,\nto find a massive glowing\npurple portal.\nIn-between levels,\nyou\u2019re able to edit the\nspells loaded into your\nwands, buy new wands or\nspells, and pick a perk. I\nsometimes found myself\ntoo short on gold to buy\nmuch, and it took some\ntime mixing and matching\nthe spells I wanted in each\nwand and trying them out.\nDespite this slight tedium,\nNoita breaks free from the\ntradition of accumulating\npowerups of predetermined nature with this\nmechanic. Every wand\nhas random stats such as\ncast delay, spell slots and\nmaximum mana, and the\nnumber of possible spells\nis in the hundreds, making\nthousands, if not millions,\nof possible combinations.\nWands can produce\nenergy spheres with trails\nof fire or shoot explosive\ncrystals that deal critical\ndamage to slime drenched\nenemies or fire bouncy\norbs that ricochet all over.\nThis system has great potential alone, but combining it with the physically\nsimulated world unlocks\na treasure trove of golden\nmoments.\nThe developers have\nmade the most of this\nwith an inbuilt replay\nfunction that can record a\nfew seconds of gameplay\n\u2013 useful for the many\namusing and frustrating\ndeaths you\u2019ll experience.\nDying in Noita takes many\nforms, and you\u2019ll often get\n\u201cNoita\u2019d\u201d. What I mean\nby this is a death that you\nsimply can\u2019t predict. An\nenemy could pick up a\nwand with a nuke spell\nand instantly obliterate\nyou in an all-encompass-ing circle of fire. You\ncould be trying out a new\nwand and foolishly turn\nyourself into whiskey,\ndying instantly, or accidentally douse yourself\nin a polymorphine potion\nand become a useless\nwinged sheep during a\ncrucial fight. While fun,\nthe chaos does lead to\nbeing very cautious and\nmaking snap decisions to\nthe point of being almost\nunfair.\nNoita\u2019s massive scale\nextends past the 8 floors\ndownward to Hell,\nhowever, and the community has come together\nand discovered secrets\nand areas intentionally\nhidden. The lack of information can be off putting\nfor new players for sure,\nbut seeking knowledge\nfor yourself is a key theme\nof Noita. So, if you hear\nrumours of a cursed egg,\nan altar in the sky, hidden\ntreasure, an Eastern\ndesert, a Western lake,\nmysterious orbs, parallel\nuniverses or alchemical\npotions\u2026 well, just be\nprepared to dive in and do\nsome exploring.\nHopefully both games\nclean up their minor\nissues and improve their\nstrengths further \u2013 I\u2019ll certainly be keeping a close\neye on their development\ncycle in early access for\nnow.\nMillions of combinations, hidden areas; Noita encourages experimentation // Nolla\nISSUE 1738\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nHades is a mixture of addictive gameplay and captivating storytelling // Supergiant\n\n"

Our bodies\nare nutrient-rich surfaces\nwhich allow these organisms to thrive, inside and\nout, when conditions are\nright. The microorganisms that live within us\ncontribute to the ecological community of our\nmicrobiome. Our gut mi-crobiome (GM) forms as\nsoon as we are colonised\nat birth and continues to\nalter throughout our lives.\nA vast and varied\npopulation of bacteria\nand other microbes live\nalong the gut lining. The\ninteractions between\nmicroorganisms, as well\nas the interactions they\nhave with our human\ncells, are highly complex.\nSome microbes provide\nbeneficial metabolic\nproducts or help with absorption of vitamins and\nnutrients, such as certain\nB vitamins or vitamin K.\nThese \u2018good\u2019 microbes\nare known as commen-sals, living in harmony\nwith us \u2013 literally eating\nfrom the same table (the\nmeaning in Latin of their\nname). However, along\nwith the good, come the\nbad and the ugly. These\nare known as pathogens\nand cause disruption and\ndisease. Luckily, commensals often keep the\nmore dangerous microbes\nunder control, preventing\ninfection.\nThe effects of these\ntiny organisms are not\nlimited to the gut. As our\ngut and brain develop\ntogether from the vagus\nnerve during gestation,\noverlaps between mood\nand diet are increasingly\nshown in recent research.\nFor instance, total\nGM diversity was shown\nby researchers to have\na positive correlation\nwith increased sleep\nefficiency and total sleep\ntime. Waking and eating\nat regular times is very\nimportant for maintaining\na healthy GM. Time and\ntime again, research into\nsleep shows how we are\ncreatures of habit and that\na good sleep routine of\naround 8 hours is required\nfor adults. This should be\ntime in bed to wind down\nand wake up at least, even\nif the total time is not\nspent actually sleeping.\nWhether we want to\nadmit it or not, many of\nus struggle to start the day\nwithout a cup of coffee.\nCoffee\u2019s popularity comes\nnot only from the ritual\nof preparing it or its\npleasant aroma, but from\nits physiological effects\nof short-term wakefulness\nthat our brain begins\nto rely on. In a healthy\nwake/sleep cycle, a compound in the body, called\nadenosine, accumulates\nin waking hours to trigger\ntiredness at the end of the\nday. Caffeine, the active\nstimulant in coffee, allows\nus to overcome tiredness\ntemporarily by blocking\nadenosine from targeting\nits receptor, acting antag-onistically. As adenosine\nreceptors are present in\nthe gut as well as in the\nbrain, the effects of drinking coffee are not limited\nto temporary alertness.\nCaffeine can also cause\nstress through vasodi-lation of blood vessels\nand can lead to an upset\nstomach. However, coffee\ncontains polyphenols\nand antioxidants which\nare naturally-occurring\ncompounds in plants that\ncan boost our GM. In\nrecent studies, a higher\nconsumption of caffeine\nwas correlated with a\nricher GM and reduced\ninflammation of the gut.\nSo \u2013 as with anything,\ncaffeine is best consumed\nin moderation.\nWild garden of gut bacteria // Nicola Fawcett\nAlcohol is another\ncommonly consumed bev-erage. Within the gut, the\nalcohol we drink is largely\nabsorbed in the small\nintestine and stomach.\nAlcohol contains high\nquantities of sugar which,\nonce inside the body, can\ndrive over-proliferation\nof hungry bacteria in the\ngut, causing unbalanced\nmicrobial growth (known\nas dysbiosis). Paneth\ncells in the small intestine\ndetect bacteria levels and\ncan secrete antibacterial\ncompounds to prevent\ndysbiosis - but when alcohol is present these cells\nbecome suppressed, and\nwe lose the protection they\noffer. This can be very\ndangerous for our health;\nwith more bacteria pres-ent, competition for space\nand resources increases,\nso the bacteria secrete\ntoxins in self-defence.\nHowever, the toxins cause\nharm to their immediate\nenvironment, which is the\ncase within our gut. Our\nimmune system reacts to\nclear the danger by increasing an inflammatory\nimmune response to the\nbacteria.\nAlcohol also causes the\ngut to become \u2018leakier\u2019,\nweakening the cell-cell\nbarriers. This is dangerous\nas it allows more alcohol\nand toxins to be absorbed\ninto the bloodstream.\nMany cancers and cases\nof liver disease can be\nworsened by alcohol-in-duced inflammation in the\ngut. Evidence has shown\nthat excessive alcohol\nconsumption is associated\nwith liver damage, a key\norgan in filtering toxins\nand expired immune cells.\nStudies which monitor\ndiet may give clues on\nhow to alleviate the risks\nof poor health associated\nwith dysbiosis and gut\ninflammation. More\n\u201cThe effects\nof these tiny\norganisms are\nnot limited to\nthe gut\u201d\nhuman trials are needed\nto confirm the benefits\nof using dietary supple-ments, such as probiotics,\nto reduce side effects from\nthe over-consumption\nof alcohol and caffeine,\nsleep deprivation, or\neven taking a course of\nantibiotics.\nEach microbe within\nourGMhastheintentionto\nsurvive and either help or\nhinder our bodies as a side\neffect. When dysbiosis\noccurs, often the growth\nof pathogenic strains is\nfavoured, disrupting GM\nhealth. Recuperative sleep\nis essential for the body to\nwork optimally. The varying outcomes of dietary\ncomponents are largely\ndown to personal habits\nand the best thing is to be\naware of your own limits,\nespecially in the case of\nalcohol. Regulating our\ndiet is a manageable step\nwe can take to ensure\nwe feed our body, and\nits guests, to maintain a\nbalanced, healthy GM.

    "content": "ISSUE 1738\nFELIX\n9\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn Act of God\nI\nwas first introduced\nto An Act of God\nyears ago, when Jim\nParsons, best known\nfor playing Sheldon\nCooper on The Big Bang\nTheory, was a guest\non some kind of a late\nnight show, promoting\nthe original Broadway\nplay-slash-stand-up-show\nwith him playing God\nAlmighty. I was curious to\nsee how it would come to-gether, given the sensitive\nnature of the show could\nhave either easily turned\ninto controversy, or ended\nup as a complete bore if\nplayed safe in fear of said\ncontroversy. However,\ngiven how often I get to\nsee Broadway shows in\nNew York (almost never),\nI thought my odds of\nseeing it were unlikely.\nYears later, just when I\nhad pretty much forgotten\nits existence, I found that\nthe show was announced\nto be gearing towards its\nLondon debut, starring\ncomedian Zoe Lyons\nas God, with the script\nupdated for London audiences by the original play-wright, David Javerbaum.\nHere was my chance to\ngo!\nAs I approached the\nvenue, I was convinced\nthat Google Maps had lost\nits mind, making me twist\nand turn into dodgy back\nstreets only to end up at\nsome kind of a dungeon\nnear Waterloo Station.\nTurns out, I was at the\nexact right place - the\naptly named \u2018The Vaults\u2019.\nUpon entering the au-ditorium, if you could call\nit that, you were greeted\nby a double bed facing a\nbunch of chairs in what\ncan only be described\nas a dark basement. Not\nknowing what to expect\nexactly, I was further\nintrigued by the setting I\nwas thrown in.\nOver 90 minutes, God\ntried Her best to answer\nmany questions that have\nplagued human existence\nfor millenia such as \u2018why\ndo bad things happen to\ngood people?\u2019, at times\nwith extreme brutality.\nOne of my main takeaways from the show was\nthe way humans tend\nto find ways to justify\neverything, however\nhorrible or absurd,\nthrough God. There was\none particular line that\nwas very impactful, and\none which I\u2019ve been pondering upon since.\n\u2018You are my greatest\ncreation, and I am your\nworst.\u2019\nThe updated script is\noverall hilarious, touching\nupon expected issues such\nas the then-upcoming\ngeneral election, Brexit,\nand making ample references to pop culture, such\nas Kanye\u2019s recent, weirdly\nself-centred gospel album.\nThe underground vibe\nof the theatre helped to\nset the mood, making me\nfeel like I was at some\nsort of secret gathering.\nComplete with the occasional magic trick and\noutbursts of God\u2019s wrath,\nAn Act of God was a\nsmart, entertaining script\nbrought to life skillfully\nby Zoe Lyons, and her\ntwo Angels, Matt Tedford\nand Tom Bowen.\nAfter the collapse of man comes\u2026 jellyfish?\nH\now art interacts with\nand depicts\nthe changing\nclimate is pivotal to how\nwe think about climate\nchange. This is the\nunderlying idea of Ecovisionaries running right\nnow at the RoyalAcademy\nof Arts. Very much a\nmultimedia exhibition,\nit features works from\nDeepMind, AntFarm\nand Olafur Eliasson (you\nmight have seen his art in\nyour instagram feed following his Tate Modern\nexhibition earlier this\nyear), just to name a few.\nAt Eco-visionaries you\ncan see everything from\nvideo compilations of\ngiraffes dying and ships\nwrecking; architectural\narchetypes that aim to\nattract air pollution or\nfoster dolphins; to a life-sized CGI-rendition of the\nlast male white rhinoceros\nthat ever lived. All of\nthese works are amazing\nindividually, but there\u2019s\none that stands out of the\ncrowd as the absolute\nshowstopper. The very last\nwork before you exit the\nexhibition is a 16-minute\nlong video. You can only\nenter the room every 16th\nminute, when the doors\nopen. Inside, the viewers\nget their own headset and\nsit down facing a mirror.\nThrust into a dystopian\nnarrative, you leave the\nroom fully believing that\njellyfish are going to\ntake over the world. The\nfilm is made by Rimini\nProtokoll, a group of\nthree German artists situated in Berlin. Normally\nworking with theatre, this\ninteractive experience\nis surprisingly smoothly\nexecuted and is, like\nmany theatres, dependent\non audience participation.\nThe narrative voice inside\nyour headphones will\nsuddenly ask you to do\nslightly ridiculous and\nuncomfortable things,\nbut please bear with it as\nit makes it more fun for\neveryone else.\nThe narrative of the\nexhibition is clearly\nportrayed in the art space\nitself. There\u2019s a little\nintroduction-pathway that\nleads you into the exhibition and summarises the\ninterface between climate\nchange and art and signs\nhung up around the exhibition invites the visitor\nto think about the art in a\ncertain way.\nAs a whole, it works,\nbut unfortunately, it also\nisn\u2019t enough. There are\ntwo recurring themes;\nvideo installations and\narchitectural prototypes.\nYou\u2019d think that in today\u2019s\nworld with climate\nmarches left and right,\nthere\u2019d be more variety\nof art to exhibit in a place\nlike this. The stuff that is\ngood is EXCELLENT,\nbut there isn\u2019t that much\nto see. Walking out past a\nbunch of kindergarteners\u2019\nclimate action posters,\nyou\u2019re left with a craving\nfor more. Maybe if the\ncurators had more time,\nthey could have found\nmore artists.

    "content": "Iraqi Revolution Against the Norms of Society\nThe prime minister has resigned, but protests in Iraq continue. Women are increasingly demanding their rights.\nWill there be a social turning point in this patriarchal country?\nT\nhe demonstrators\nin Iraq have\nwon an important battle. On\nDecember 1st, the Iraqi\nParliament accepted\nPrime Minister Adil\nAbdul-Mahdi\u2019s resig-nation. A key demand\nof the demonstrators\nwas fulfilled. The head\nof the government, who\nwanted to brutally crush\nthe current Iraqi uprising,\nwas gone. However, this\nhas not ended the wave\nof protests that have now\nreached their 68th day.\nThe people who have\nbeen taking to the streets\nin Iraq since October 1st\nare demanding more than\njust the resignation and replacement of politicians.\nThey want something\nfundamental to change in\ntheir country. Not only po-litically, but also socially\nand culturally. There\nare a striking number of\nwomen, young and old,\nwho are supporting this\nmovement and making it\nexceptional.\nNever before in the\nhistory of Iraq, have\nwomen raised their voices\nso openly. Women play a\nkey role in the protests.\nHundreds of thousands\nhave joined the rallies in\nthe capital, Baghdad, and\nother Iraqi cities. Photos\nof women who have\nwrapped the Iraqi flag\naround their heads like a\nveil or thrown it over their\nshoulders are circulating\non social media platforms.\nThe female protesters are\nat the forefront of the\nprotests, but their role in\nthe background is at least\nas important.\nFemale doctors have\njoined the uprising to voluntarily treat the protesters\nwounded by government\nsecurity forces. Despite\nthe security crackdown,\na significant number of\nwomen have sided with\ntheir fellow countryman\nto help make the protests\nsucceed. Cooking and\nbaking took place in\nstations set up in Tahrir\nSquare, the makeshift\nepicentre of the protests\nin Baghdad. Hospitals and\nmedical practices have\nprovided healthcare to\nthe protesters. In a tunnel\nunder the square, artists\nhave painted wall murals.\nIn the evening, candles\nare lit to commemorate\nthe dead.\n\u201cWe need to get rid\nof the idea that it is not\nright for women to participate in everything,\u201d\nShaima, who joined the\nrally in Baghdad with\nher daughter, sisters and\nnieces, told The National.\n\u201cWomen must participate\nin everything. If women\nwere in the government, it\nwould be even better.\u201d\nD e m o n s t r a t i n g\nalongside men meant a\nlong-running taboo was\nbroken.TheIraqisocietyis\nmostly shaped by Islamic\nconservative and patriarchal norms. Men have the\nsay in both politics and\nsociety. Women are often\nmarginalised. \u201cUnfortunately, we have traditions\nthat have held us back,\u201d\nsaid Shaima. \u201cAnd even\nif women do not demon-strate, you can see them\nstanding at their door for\nmoral support. It is the\nfirst time that something\nlike this has happened in\nmodern-day Iraq.\u201d\nIn previous waves of\nprotests there were hardly\nany female demonstra-tors: now the young men\nin Baghdad are accepting\nthat women are an essential part of the movement.\nLike men, they are risking\ntheir lives too. \u201cAll the\nwomen here know that\nthey can die at any time,\u201d\nactivist Haneen Ghranem\ntold The Independent. The\nexact number of female\ndemonstrators that have\nbeen killed in the protests\nso far is unknown, but\nthere have always been\nreports of women being\nkidnapped on the sidelines of the protests.\ncourageous and conscious\nwomen of this movement.\nMany believe that her\ncase along with the other\nkidnappings and deaths\nhave only motivated more\nwomen to join the demonstrations as they no longer\nsee violence as a restraint\nfor the pursuit of a new\nIraq.\nSome are already\nspeaking of a turning point\nfor the role of women in\nthe Iraqi society. \u201cWe\nare the generation of the\nfuture,\u201d stated 20-year-old\nstudent Haneen to The Independent. \u201cAs children,\nwe lived through the fall\nof the Saddam regime and\nits aftermath. As teens, we\nlived through terrorism\nand ISIS. As a youth, we\nhave been living through\nfailed governments,\nstealing our rights. The\ntime has come for us to\nspeak out.\u201d\nBaghdad\u2019s Tahrir\nsquare \u2013 epicentre of the\nanti-government protests\nIn the capital, Baghdad,\nrepresentatives of political parties have met to\ndiscuss the formation of\na new government to put\nan end to the ongoing\nviolence in the country.\nFollowing the resignation\nof Abdul-Mahdi, the parliamentary group leaders\ndiscussed the draft of a\nnew electoral law to make\nthe Parliament younger\nand more representative\nand appealing to the protesting youth. So far, more\nthan 1,000 protestors are\nreported to have been\nkilled, and around 25,000\nothers have been injured.\nThe protests are showing\nno signs of stopping.\nIraqi protesters // Wikimedia\nThe best-known case\nwas that of Saba al-Mah-dawi, a young doctor from\nBaghdad who helped the\nwounded and distributed\nfood on the frontlines.\nThe doctor was gone for\neleven days after armed\nmen dragged her out of\nher car. She was released\nearlier this month. According to her family, she\nwas held in a house and\nwas repeatedly questioned\nand interrogated.\nIf the goal of such\nattacks was to intimidate\nand prevent other women\nfrom taking part in the\nprotests, then they have\nmistaken, asSaba has\nbecome a symbol of the\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY, 10TH\nJANUARY, 2020 FELIX\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nPOLITICS\nMariam Shewar\nPolitics Writer\n\u201cThe exact\nnumber\nof female\ndemonstrators\nthat have been\nkilled in the\nprotests so far\nis unknown\u201d\n6\n\u201cFemale\ndoctors have\njoined the\nuprising to\nvoluntarily\ntreat the\nprotesters\nwounded by\ngovernment\nsecurity forces\u201d\n\n"

The Hempstocks,\nthe three crazy women that\nare your neighbours live\non magical woodlands\nand coins keep appearing\never since you touched a\nfish from the Hempstocks\u2019\npond. The world is an\ninexorable chasm punctuated with fantasy.\nThe Ocean at the End\nof the Lane, based on the\nnovel of the same name by\nNeil Gaimon and adapted\nby Joel Horwood is an\nextraordinary tease about\na mystical, inexplorable\nchildhood. After all, what\nis childhood without an\nindistinguishable mix of\nimagination and memory.\nThe play is an after-thought, a homage to\nthe tougher elements of\ngrowing up: reckoning\nwith death and loss. The\nprotagonist, imaginatively\nnamed The Boy, saddened\nby the news of his father\u2019s\ndeath comes back to his\nhometown and ponders\nabout his childhood, particularly his 12th birthday\nwhen he first saw a dead\nperson. And this begins a\nleapfrogging process from\nthe past (1988, to be exact)\nto present, as peace is\nmade with an imaginative\nversion of the past.

Puppetry\nDirector, Finn Caldwell\nand Costume and Puppet\nDesigner, Samuel Wyer\n(both involved in notable\nworks such as War Horse\nand Wizard of Oz pre-viously) have created a\nwonderfully splendid set\nwiled out of imagination.\nThe acting is powerful\nand clearly well-re-hearsed. Despite a few\nunsmooth exits, the show\nran seamlessly, testament\nto great teamwork. The\nwitty humour of the\nHempstocks coupled\nwith their eccentricity\nare a source of continual\namusement in this action\nfilled monster fest of a\nplay.\nThe Ocean at the End\nof the Lane is one of Neil\nGaimon\u2019s most autobiographical book.

But Cummings\u2019 venture may be doomed to fail.\nCOMMENT\nLloyd James\nComment Writer\nI\nt\u2019snotyourtypicaljob\nposting. 2,900 words\nlong, and prefaced\nwith quotes from various intellectuals, the blog\npost recently authored by\nDominic Cummins calls\nfor applications from \u201cunusual\u201d mathematicians,\nphysicists, economists,\ncomputer scientists and\ndata scientists, along with\n\u201csuper-talented weirdos\u201d\nwith \u201codd skills\u201d (no\ndoubt the pool of potential\napplicants at Imperial is\nrather large). Cummins,\ncurrent Chief Special\nAdvisor to PM Johnson,\nintends to deploy this elite\nteam of misfits to address\ncertain \u201cprofound problems at the core of how\nthe British state makes decisions\u201d through big data,\nartificial intelligence, and\nadvanced mathematics.\nI confess that my first\nreaction to skimming the\npost was a positive one.\nThe general thrust of\nwhat Cummings is trying\nto do here is absolutely\ncorrect. He has previously\ndiscussed his frustrations\nwith trying to get anything\ndone within \u2018the blob\u2019that\nis the civil service, full of\n\u201cOxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan\nat dinner parties.\u201d At the\nsame time, British universities are producing many\ntalented problem solvers\nfrom STEM backgrounds\nwho can rarely apply their\nskills for the betterment of\nsociety. Instead, they are\ncaught by corporations\nwho have them nudge\naround numbers to make\nthe wealthy wealthier,\nor apply bleeding-edge\ndata science techniques\nto optimising the number\nof chicken sandwiches\nstocked on a trans-At-lantic flight. While large\ncompanies have realised\nthat acquiring this kind\nof talent is essential to\nremaining competitive,\nHer Majesty\u2019s Government seems to be lagging\ndesperately far behind.\nGiven all this,\nCummings\u2019 new initiative\nseems like a step in the\nright direction. But if\nyou consider the posting\nin more detail, and read\npublished responses to the\nposting from academics, it\nis clear that this approach\nis fatally flawed.\nOn the surface,\nCummings seems to\nhave insight on how scientific and mathematical\nideas can be applied to\nunderstanding society.\nIn his blog post, he lists\nseveral technical papers\nthat an applicant would\nbe expected to understand\nand discuss. But impressive as this list may seem,\nit has been pointed out\nthat many of these scientific concepts have been\naround for a long time,\nand their links to social\nphenomena, while well\nexplored, are ultimately\nvery tenuous. Indeed, as\ncommented by science\nwriter Philip Ball in a\npiece for The Article: to\nthose familiar with these\nconcepts, Cummings\u2019\ntext is reminiscent of a\n\u201crookie postgrad spouting\na breathless stream of\nbuzzwords and random\ncitations, devoid of depth\nor context, in the hope of\nconvincing his supervisor\nthat he knows his stuff.\u201d\nWithout a broad vision\nfor how these disparate\nconcepts from statistical\nmechanics and machine\nlearning will fit together\nto produce new under-standing, this initiative\nwould be starting on\nshaky ground.\nBut, let\u2019s give\nCummings the benefit\nof the doubt and assume\nthat he knows his stuff. Is\nhe right to think that the\napplication of these ideas\nto social problems will\nyield the \u201clow hanging\nfruit \u2014 trillion-dollar bills\nlying on the street\u201d that he\ndescribes? It\u2019s taken as an\narticle of faith in certain\ncircles (most notably,\ntech companies) than any\nproblem is soluble if you\nhave: a sufficiently complicated algorithm, a sufficiently voluminous hoard\nof data, or a sprinkling\nof the magical pixie dust\ncalled \u2018machine learning\u2019\n(whatever that means).\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative\nParty, I struggle to believe\nthose goals will serve\nto improve the lives of\nordinary people.\nI\u2019ve not addressed\ncertain other \u2018deficiencies\nof appeal\u2019 the job itself\nhas: the posting advertises\nthat \u201cyou will not have\nweekday date nights,\nyou will sacrifice many\nweekends \u2014 frankly it\nwill hard having a boy/\ngirlfriend at all\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll\nbin you within weeks if\nyou don\u2019t fit.\u201d Plus, you\nwould be working for a\nman who, in the same\nblog post, claims that\nWestminster does not\nneed more \u201cdrivel\u201d about\nBrexit is Cummings\u2019God child that brought him to prominence //Pixabay\nBut if you keep abreast\nof tech news, you\u2019ll know\nthat algorithms can be\nracist, and data collection\ncan be downright Orwellian. These things are\npowerful tools, but they\ncan backfire, and they can\nbe applied to nefarious\npurposes just as easily as\nadmirable ones. What\u2019s\nreally missing from\nCummings\u2019 2,900 words\nis any sense of moral\ndirection. There\u2019s no\nindication at all of the sort\nof policies these technologies would be deployed\nin aid of. \u2018Solving the\nnation\u2019s problems\u2019 is\nby no means an objective goal, and when an\norganisation is free to\ndefine its own metrics of\nsuccess, it should come\nas no surprise when those\nmetrics happen to align\nwith the interests of its\nmasters. And under Boris\ngender identity diversity.\nBut ultimately, anyone\nstill considering applying\nfor this job has to ask\nthemselves whether they\nreally believe that joining\nCummings\u2019 basket of\noddballs will see their\nlabour contribute to the\nbetterment of society. And\nif not, do they care?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really\nmissing from\nCummings\u2019\n2900 words is a\nsense of moral\ndirection, with\nno indication\nof what\npolicies will be\nsupported\u201d\n\n"
