She can\nbe sighted anywhere from Tate Modern to the Royal Albert Hall, flexing her press tickets in the face of\ntax-paying, innocent civilians. Known to her friends\nas a worshipper of all things free, writing for Felix was\na natural gravitational pull for her.\nShe mainly enjoys contemporary art, with a weakness for videography and surrealism. However, you\ncan tempt her with a plethora of things, even plays\nand circuses (especially Cirque du Soleil). Outside\nworking hours you can find her going to life drawing classes, sewing masks to sell on depop or running\n(away from her problems) along the Thames.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by her potential resting bitch face\n- Amanda is very happy to be approached. She\u2019ll happily discuss her favourite films over a free Pret coffee,\nprovided you have the subscription. Or go through\nthe free collections at Tate Modern for the 10th time,\nand that\u2019s this year only. Her best piece of advice to\nall incoming freshers is to get a Tate Collective\nmembership, with which you can get \u00a37 tickets to all\nthe big exhibitions. But also to join Felix Arts, either\nas a writer or as an editor.\nEditor suggestions: Tate Modern, V&A,\nWhitechapel Gallery, Royal Academy of Arts,\nBarbican.\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nOzbil (also known as Oz depending on who you\nask) considers himself to be ancient, being well\ninto his sixth (and hopefully final) year at Imperial.\nOne may mistakenly assume with age comes wisdom,\nbut the only way Ozbil is wise is when it comes to finessing the London theatre scene to score cheap tick-ets.\nHaving been involved with Felix since his fourth\nyear at Imperial, Ozbil deeply regrets not finding out\nabout Felix Arts sooner. Not only does he feel like he\u2019s\nmade many great friends, he has also received a shocking number of free tickets to plays and musicals only\nto review them for the paper. In fact, there was a solid period where Ozbil joked around saying he spent\nmore time in theatres than in lecture theatres or operating theatres.\nUnfortunately, since the onset of the pandemic,\nnone of this has been possible. Therefore, the only\nthing that\u2019s kept Ozbil from turning to alcohol has\nbeen shouting the entire Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording from start to finish, obviously\nrepeating Satisfied seven times.\nOzbil is fascinated by how the London theatre\nscene is so inaccessible for young people and loves to\nwrite about the different schemes that make the theatre affordable and accessible for young people or criticising the lack thereof.\nOzbil seems not to be able to get enough of Felix,\nas he can also be found editing the TV section, mostly ranting about his most recent binges... and Schitt\u2019s\nCreek. Always Schitt\u2019s Creek.\nSome of Ozbil\u2019s favourite musicals:\nCompany - Sondheim is the musicals what Shakespeare is to theatre, don\u2019t @ me.\nSweeney Todd - I mean, come on, Sondheim, murder\nAND cannibalism?! What\u2019s not to love?\nHamilton - the musical intricacy of all the patterns\nblows me every time...

One of\nthe key aims of this consultation is to\ngive the staff an hourly pay rate the\nreflects the London Living Wage, a\nkey manifesto point of Abhijay Sood\u2019s\nUnion President re-election cam-paign.\nWhile he stated that COVID restrictions make definite plans difficult he has said that he regretted \u201cthe\nloss of confidence and drop in satisfaction amongst students and student\nstaff\u201d and acknowledged the need to\n\u201cchange dramatically in every single\narea that we operate, including within our leadership and management\nteams\u201d.\nOther staff members have echoed\nthis Union attitude paradigm shift,\nsaying that they would work shifts\ndown in the bar, in order to get a better understanding of conditions for\nstudent staff workers.\nSood also recognised that there\nhas been a disconnect in previous\nyears between the service provided\nby the Union and what students actually want saying that they are looking\nto adopt a \u201cstrategy that better aligns\nthem with what students want\u201d\nThe staffing consultation can be\ncompleted and more details can be\nfound at www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/news/union-staffing-consulta-tion-and-reorganisation\nUnion apologises for staff treatment\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT\nDuring the 2019/20\nacademic year it is obvious that the Union\nfaced a number of significant challenges\nwithin our own oper-ation, most notably\nwithin our bars and\nkitchen functions. This\nclearly resulted in a loss\nof confidence and drop\nin satisfaction amongst\nstudents and student\nstaff alike. Whilst we\ncannot comment on\nspecific staffing mat-ters, we completely\naccept that we did not\ndeliver a service that\nImperial College students deserve. We apologise and want to stress\nthat we have learned\nimportant lessons from\nthis period.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has required\nthe Union to change\ndramatically in every\nsingle area that we op-erate, including within our leadership and\nmanagement teams.\nDue to social distancing rules, the only venue we are able to operate for the foreseeable\nfuture is 568 under an\nentirely different operating model. This\ncontext has therefore\nrequired the Union to\nmake significant alterations to our permanent\nstaffing team. The consultation process for\nthis has now been com-pleted, and some further details can be seen\nhere:www.imperialcol-legeunion.org/news/\nunion-staffing-consul-tation-and-reorganisa-tion.\nOver the next six\nmonthsweareplanning\na strategic review of the\nentire Union, as we\nseek to become a better\nrun and more effective\norganisation. Our plan\nis to positively rebuild\nour commercial outlets once the pandemic\nhas eased \u2013 but based\non a new strategy that\nbetter aligns them with\nwhat students want. A\nmajor element of this\nwork will of course be\nhow we deliver a better service, but we also\nplan to look at how we\nmaximise the opportunities available to student staff. We are committed to becoming a\nUnion that trusts students to help us run our\nbarsandourshops,and\nensures as much money\nas possible is put back\ninto the pockets of our\nmembers.\nWe will be consulting heavily with students (and student\nstaff) over the coming\nmonths and are excited\nto start the process of\nour long term transfor-mation.\nThis statement and other comments\ncoming from the Union point towards a real change in attitude occur-ring. Union officials are reportedly\nfrustrated by the disconnect between\nstudent staff and the collapsing moral\nof the workforce. Already there are\npositive signs of change in the air.\nCasual bar staff were kept on the\nfurlough scheme over the summer in\nwhat is an encouraging gesture given\nthe difficult financial situation of the\nUnion. We here at Felix hope that\nthis is not a flash in the pan and that\nthe conditions of bar staff will continue to improve into the future.\nEDITORIAL\nCasual staff were discouraged from\ndrinking in Union bars as a further an-ti-theft policy with staff parties being\ntreated with suspicion and hostility.\nManagers hired security to watch parties and would themselves loiter nearby,\nwatching over proceedings, contributing to the culture of intimidation.\nUnfortunately for many staff, there\nwas no possibility of leaving. A former\nstudent manager told Felix that for\nmany EU students the bar is the only\nway that they can get through universi-ty. While qualifying for Home Student\ntuition fees they are not eligible for\nmaintenance loans or support. Therefore, unless they can be entirely parent\nsupported, these students must find\nwork in order to eat. Felix has heard of\ntwo students in the last two years that\nfailed their exams while working over\n30 hours a week in the bar and of many\nmore people that struggled to learn\nwhile working 40+ hours a week with\nrequests for Departmental assistance\nbeing met by an attitude of \u201cif you are\ntoo poor you shouldn\u2019t be here\u201d.\nStudent bar staff are still not paid\nLondon Living Wage.\nAll the deep fat fryers are on constantly making the kitchen a furnace to work in\nCredits: Calum Drysdale\npoor treatment by management\n\n"

The idea, analogous to the \u2018Eat Out\nto Help Out\u2019 Scheme, suggests the government compensating ticket charges\nor matching occupancy rates at theatres\nand events. George is\nnoticeably sceptical\nabout this. After a\npensive sip of his cof-fee, he explains why\n\u201cThe Culture Vouchers, if they went\nahead, would actually be more beneficial\nto workers than other\nforms of support (as\nthe shows are hap-pening, giving them\nwork), but I am sceptical due to the high cost of tickets, and\nthat with 30% capacity, the government\nwould have to buy two extra tickets for\nevery one sold to individuals [for the\nscheme to be of any real help]\u201d.\n\u201cMost of the people involved in the\nmusic events industry work on a freelance basis. They are the people who\nneed funding the most and are falling through the cracks currently\u201d says\nGeorge. While it is undeniable that\nthe furlough scheme and the \u2018self-employment income support scheme\u2019\n(SEISS) have been moderately helpful\nto most, the fact remains that these\nschemes are unfavourable to freelancers\nand other members of the industry for\nwhom work is seasonal. Most freelancers operate through their own limited\ncompanies and are often paid out with\ndividends, making them ineligible to\navail government relief through these\nschemes, and with the furlough scheme\nand SEISS winding down in October,\nwhat little support was otherwise available is going to vanish.\nIt is a difficult outlook indeed, both\nfor the people and fiscally for the gov-ernment. The current relief efforts\nand financial support by the government across industries have greatly increased the country\u2019s debt. \u201cOne of the\nthings we would like to see from the\ngovernment is guarantee cancellation\ninsurance for the events\u201d, he goes on to\nsay, \u201cbecause at this\npoint, it\u2019s not\nthatthemeans\naren\u2019t there\nto handle\nevents... but\nthe financial\ndownside of\na cancellation\ndue to lockdown or anything is too\nhigh a risk\u201d.\nCancellations\nrelated to COVID-19 are generally not\ncovered by insurance providers.\nEven with socially distanced perfor-manceshowever,therearetwoconcerns\nlooming. Scale and public confidence.\nThe latter is something George is confident about, \u201cWith enough measures\nand proper outreach it is possible to attract people, because there is demand\u201d.\nBut the former, scale, is something that\neven George is sceptical about. Performances depend on a minimum footfall\nto break even, but with reduced capacity performances now being the norm,\nthese events are likely to add more fi-nancialstrainonproducersandtheatres\nin the long run than do any real good.\nRegarding the future of the industry,\nGeorge feels ambivalent. He is certainly excited about the prospect of music\nfestivals gaining an online dimension.\nThe pandemic has pushed the industry\nto find ever more innovative ways of\nreaching their audience, with e-festivals\npropping up all over Europe and America. \u201cBut a lot of companies are folding\nup, going bust\u2026 Their equipment is being bought pennies to the pound, either\nby companies without the necessary\nexperience or expertise here in the UK\nwho don\u2019t know what to do with them,\nor by companies on mainland Europe\u201d\nhe goes on to say.\nAs he says this, his smile goes away,\nand he says the dreaded word, one that\nwe have all been avoiding for the past\nfew months \u2014 Brexit. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t\nforget that we are facing two issues at\nthis time. Every industry is facing the\nbrunt of the pandemic and the fallout\nof Brexit, which will hit us in earnest\nin January 2021\u201d he warns. Of course,\nwith everything happening, that is perhaps the last thing on our minds, but\nGeorge worries that Brexit is going to\nlead to brain drain for the industry, as\npeople with niche skills move to other\nlucrative mainstream jobs or find opportunities elsewhere in mainland Europe.\nThere have been constant calls on\nthe government from familiar faces in\nthe industry to do more. A nationwide\ndemonstration, #WeMakeEvents, took\nplace on the 11th of August to bring\nawareness to the plight of the supply\nchain workers of the live events in-dustry. The group have since regularly\norganised events to create awareness\nacross the UK. \u201cWe basically want to\nbring to light the concerns of the supply chain, freelance engineers, lighting\nequipment manufacturers... people\nwho don\u2019t fit in the current definition\nof the government relief package\u201d explains George. This call has indeed\nresonated with a lot of people and\nthe movement has taken a shape\nof its own. There are now #We-MakeEvents movements in\nthe USA, Netherlands and in\nNorthern Ireland.\nThis resonance across countries is certainly a sign that this\nis indeed uncharted territory for\neveryone. George smiles as he acknowledges this and signs\noff by saying, \u201cWe will\npull through, people\nalways need art and\nmusic\u2026 it\u2019s not going anywhere, and\nneither are we\u201d. As a sign of things to\ncome - musicals are scheduled to make\na return to the West End on the 14th of\nNovember, with \u2018Six\u2019, as the wildly popular show about the six wives of Henry VIII relocates to a larger venue for a\nsocially distanced run. Most West End\ntheatres have confirmed that they will\nremain closed at least until early 2021.\nBut with the second wave of the pandemic hitting soon and with the risk of\na lockdown, I wasn\u2019t very hopeful - but\nI didn\u2019t let my scepticism show. George\nwas an optimistic person - all things\nconsidered. He had a certain cheerfulness \u2014 even when our conversations\nmeandered on the dismal outlook of\nhis industry and livelihood. Call it\nwhat you want, \u2018Spirit\u2019, \u2018Resolve\u2019, \u2018Moxie\u2019, \u2018Je ne sais quoi\u2019, he seemed to have\nit\u2026 I have seen it in many before, the\nbus driver who shuttled many during\nthe lockdown, the clerk at the supermarket who donned a mask at the high\nof the first wave, the NHS staff who are\nstill battling this virus. Whatever it is\n\u2014 it\u2019s going to take something greater\nthan this pandemic to knock people\nlike George down. After the interview I\nwatched him walk away and merge into\nthe crowds at Fulham Broadway - one\namong many, braving this pandemic\nand eager to make the world a better\nplace on the other side of this mess.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY\nOF PEOPLE ARE LIVING\nOF THEIR SAVINGS AND\nTHINKING CONSTANTLY\nOF BRANCHING OUT TO\nOTHER INDUSTRIES\n\u201c\nCredits:\nMembers of\nParliment\nUK / Official\nPortrait\nClaire Hannah - Social Democratic & Labour Party MP for Belfast South\nIN SHORT, THE SCHEME DID NOT REFLECT THE MODERN\nECONOMY AND MODERN WORK PRACTICES, NOR THE WAYS\nIN WHICH SO MANY HAD BEEN LIVING - CLAIRE HANNAH,\nMP AT THE HOUSES OF PARLIMENT\n\u201c\nplains George.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n32\nMUSIC\nAmerican singer-songwriter Frank Zappa famously said about music criticism: \u201cMost rock\njournalism is people who can\u2019t write, interviewing\npeople who can\u2019t talk, for people who can\u2019t read.\u201d I\ncan\u2019t say that any of those three things are ever simultaneously true. I hope that if you\u2019re staring at this\npage you can in fact read. I also hope that I never end\nup at an interview with someone who has nothing of\nvalue to say. However, I can say that when I started\ntrying music journalism I sure as shit couldn\u2019t write. I\nwouldn\u2019t even say I could now.\nBefore I started, I barely read music criticism. I\nbarely read at all. I enjoyed talking to people about\nmusic. I enjoyed sharing music with others, and\nhaving it shared with me. I was addicted to the dopamine hit I would get whenever someone would overhear the music I was listening to and ask me \u201cwho\u2019s\nthis?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the name of this song?\u201d. Not just\nbecause it\u2019s gratifying when people agree with your\ntaste in art, but because it gave me an opportunity to\ntalk about the music I loved.\nDoes this sound anything like you?\nFirst, I wrote an album review, then a soundtrack\nreview, then an opinion piece. As I wrote more, I\ngained more confidence in my opinions and became\nmore fluent in the way I discussed music. I wasn\u2019t\nwriting articles that often and having them published\nin Felix was just an added bonus for my ego. The\nbiggest benefit was the way it improved me.\nIn short - the barrier is low and all it takes is a little\nbit of passion.\nIs there an album, single, artist, performance, ven-ue, collective of artists, genre, era, soundtrack, even\na ringtone that you just really want to talk about?\nExcellent, that\u2019s step one done, only one more to go.\nGranted the next step takes longer, but the first step\nis the hardest.\nStep two is actually writing. It can be tackled in\na myriad of different ways but there are some core\nconcepts to keep in mind (please be aware this is my\nopinion and not fact, there is plenty of other advice\nonline).\nThe first key element, and probably most impor-tant, is to make sure you have something unique to\nadd to the readers experience. If you don\u2019t do this,\nyou\u2019ll just regurgitate facts and recall exactly what\nyou heard. Why read that when you could just listen\nto the music instead? Tell us your opinion. What\nparts stood out to you and why? Did they remind\nyou of something else and why is that interesting?\nUse your opinion to alter another\u2019s experience.\nOkay, so we\u2019ve established you have something\noriginal/unique to say. Now let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s\na reason you\u2019re sharing these thoughts. What is the\npoint of your article? What are you trying to teach\nthe reader? What are you trying to convince them\nof? Or maybe you\u2019re just trying to share and enter-tain.\nWhich leads me to the final key element to any\ngood piece of writing, and that\u2019s to make sure it\nis at least somewhat entertaining and/or educa-tional. Throw in some weird adjectives, a funny\nmetaphor, an obscure fact, or even ask the reader thoughtful questions. Don\u2019t leave the reader\nbored. Ask yourself, would I enjoy reading what I\nhave written?\nHey-ho you\u2019re a music writer, congratulations! I\ntold you the barrier was low. Don\u2019t worry though,\nthere\u2019s an almost infinitely high ceiling to music\nwriting. If you want to be the next Lester Bangs or\nAnthony Fantano it\u2019s going to take a lot of work.\nIn the meantime, stick to what you\u2019re passionate about and you may be surprised at what you\nproduce.\nHow to Write About Music\nFeature\nMusic for two (part 1.)\nFeature\nGuthrie Ruby Music Editor\nMiles Gulliford Music Editor\nOf the many takeaways found in the Imperial\nsex survey (see next week\u2019s issue for the survey\u2019s results in full), I was particularly struck by the\ndiversity of songs listed by respondents as their go to\nlistening during intimacy. As someone who enjoys\nmusic in any and all contexts, I felt I could offer some\nsuggestions for those who enjoy music as an accompaniment to these moments. Over the next 2 weeks\nI will be talking you through a few albums that I feel\nare particularly well suited to the bedroom by genre.\nI have endeavoured to include a selection that covers\nall bases, offering something for everyone.\nPop: Beauty Behind the Madness \u2013 The\nWeeknd\nI have to concede that The Weeknd\u2019s tasteful\nproduction and slick melodies make for an intoxicating listen which should certainly meld well into the\nintoxications of passion. A superficial examination\nof lyrics on tracks like \u2018Often\u2019 might lead the reader\nto the conclusion that songs on records like Beauty\nBehind the Madness have been designed precisely for\nloving.\nJazz: Moon Beams \u2013 Bill Evans Trio\nIn the midst of a fairly large jazz kick myself, I was\npleased to see that the genre was quite popular for\nsex jams, however many listeners seemed to go to\nplaylists rather than artists directly. If there was an\nartist to choose for loving \u2013 Bill Evans is perhaps\nunmatched, his label even released a posthumous\ncompilation titled Bill Evans for Lovers. His gentle\nyet rich playing has a near opiate effect that I defy\nlisteners to not dissolve in bliss to. Moon beams is a\npersonal favourite, packed back to front with impossibly delicate originals and velvet-smooth interpretations of classics like \u2018Polka Dots and Moonbeams\u2019,\nthis record has the added prestige of featuring Nico\nof The Velvet Underground on its cover.\nIndie: Portishead \u2013 Dummy\nPortishead\u2019s moody debut is hard to categorise, a\nslowed and warped take on early hip-hop instrumentals \u2013 perhaps the dub to hip-hop\u2019s reggae, the UK\ntrio accent their trip-hop grooves with mournful\nmelodies and understated lyrics. These downtempo\ntracks are profoundly atmospheric and seem to be\nwaiting to envelop couples into their twilit world.\nElectronic: Jacques Green - Dawn Chorus\nWhile electronic ranked quite highly for sex jam\nchoice, I found myself struggling to find a record I\nfound particularly suitable for loving. I settled upon\nJacques Greene\u2019s latest effort; a collection of delicately danceable pieces built around cavernous synths\nborrowed from the ambient oeuvre. The result is an\nethereal hour which retains some of the deep dancefloor rhythms upon which the genre is built, a listen\nthat is equal parts tranquil and exciting making this\nrecord well placed to accompany nocturnal congress.\n\n"

    "content": "The cancellation of A level exams in\nMarch 2020 left students and the\nexaminations regulator Ofqual with a\nfundamental dilemma - to accept centre\nassessed grades calculated by teachers\n(CAGs) or obtain grades for students\nalternatively. The government decided on\nthe latter, building an algorithm to determine grades based on previous centre\n(school or sixth form) attainment and\nthe ranking of each student relative to\nothers in their school.\nConcerns were\nraised for months\nafter the announcement - MPs warned\nthat only 16% of\nstudents actually\nachieve their predicted grades, prediction\ncan be mired with\nbias and the system\nof ranking relative\nto past results may\ndisadvantage bright\nstudents at historically low-achieving\nschools. On results\nday, the problems with this approach\nbecame evident, and after four days of\nchaos - students being marked down or\neven failed in exams they hadn\u2019t taken,\nlosing out on university places and being\npushed into gap years - the decision was\nreversed and students given CAGs. As\nthere was no freeze on admissions to universities in the interim, many institutions\nwere left with far more students meeting\ntheir offers than they could cater for.\nBy the 7th of September, College had\ncontacted all affected incoming students,\nadvising them that they could either take\nup their place or defer before enrolling in\nOctober 2021. The ~100 students in the\nlatter situation are being offered mentorship and support from college during\ntheir gap year. For some, the year out will\noffer the opportunity to develop new\nskills and buffer entering University at a\ntime when the \u2018University experience\u2019 is\nsocially distanced and bound by behaviour codes and hygiene rules. However,\nwith some university educators already\nconcerned about the knowledge gap produced by students out of education for\nsix months, and a lack of jobs and travel\nopportunities, having a gap year may be\ndaunting or in some cases completely\nfinancially unfeasible.\nPriority for places on courses this year\nwas offered to those from widening participation backgrounds, as was advised\nby the Office for Students - Imperial\nCollege was recently ranked the 112th of\n116 UK universities\nfor social inclusion\nby the Times, and\ngiven sustained\nefforts to increase\nthe participation of\nunder-represented\ngroups in College,\nthis moment could\nact as an inflection\npoint for the University to reconsider how to assess\nincoming students\nand dole out offers.\nExams further down\nthe line could create\nsimilar admissions problems over the\nnext few years - GCSE grades were also\nassigned by CAG, potentially affecting\nuniversity applications, and contingency\nplans for exams under a potential lockdown in 2021 have not been announced.\nStudents have also missed out a large\nchunk of learning, that with a dysfunctional track and trace system and whole\nschool years in covid bubbles could\nbecome subject to more sporadic suspen-sion. How the college will deal with this,\nand how uncertainty around grades will\ninform further widening participation\nwork remains to be seen.\nHave you been affected by the\nchanges to A level grades ?\nwould you like to tell us about\nit ?

While\nvaccine production usually takes\nmultiple years, a coronavirus vaccine\nis hoped to be developed within 12-18 months.\nVaccine testing can be split into 5\nstages:\nPre-clinical \u2013 animal testing to see\nwhether the vaccine elicits an immune response.\nPhase I \u2013 healthy human volunteers\nto determine safety and evaluate immune response.\nPhase II \u2013 hundreds of volunteers to\nidentify correct dosage.\nPhase III \u2013 thousands of volunteers\nto confirm safety and efficacy vs. a\nplacebo.\nPhase IV \u2013 studies on adverse ef-fects, long-term mmunity and vaccine usage following the approval\nand licensing of the vaccine.\nThe WHO is currently tracking the\nprogress of over 170 candidate vac-cines; at Felix, we\u2019ve chosen 5 of the\nmost promising candidates to follow,\nso watch this space!\nProcrastination: more prominent\nnow than ever, as everyone adjusts\nto studying and working from home -but what exactly is it? Experts define it\nas the voluntary delay of an important\ntask - usually to focus on more short-term, satisfying activities - despite\nknowing that we\u2019ll suffer as a result.\nStudies find that around 20% of the\npopulation are chronic procrastinators.\nUnfortunately, while some claim that\nit sparks creativity, research shows that\npeople who procrastinate have higher\nlevels of stress and lower wellbeing.\nSo why do we still do it? A common\nexplanation is poor time management.\nWhile that is a contributing factor, true\nprocrastination is a failure of self-reg-ulation, with the inability to manage\nemotions at its very foundation. Procrastinators recognise the temporal\nharm in their actions, but can\u2019t overcome the emotional urges towards distractions resulting in feelings of guilt\nand anxiety. Being in a negative mood\nthen hampers your ability to perform,\nrestarting the cycle.\nReasonsforthisvary,butthereareafew\nkey procrastinator types. Thrill-seekers like the adrenaline rush once the\ndeadline rolls around. The last-minute\npressure is the only thing that actually\nmotivates them \u2013 and, chances are, they\nhave a history of getting away with it.\nThe fearful are afraid of being judged\nfor their inadequate performance and\nwould prefer to be regarded as lacking\neffort, rather than ability. Perfectionists want an ideal final product, and so\nthink that there will be a \u2018better\u2019 mo-ment, as their future self will be more\nknowledgeableorprepared.Othersmay\nget overwhelmed\nby the number and\ncomplexity of sub-tasks required, delaying the entirety\nof the task.\nPsychologically, a phenomenon\ncalled temporal discounting\nor present bias\nmay be to blame.\nThis means that a\nstronger weight is\ngiven to payoffs that are closer to the\npresent, even if the value of something\npresently and far away is the same. Procrastinators enjoy instant gratification,\nwhile the future self seems like a different person. For example, studying\nfor a Friday test for 1 hour daily is less\npreferable to studying many hours on\nThursday night because alternative options such as socialising with friends are\nmore fun at the time.\nNeurobiologically, procrastination\nis a battle between two brain regions:\nthe limbic system and the prefrontal\ncortex. The limbic system contains the\npleasure centre, controls mood, instinct\nand reward, and functions automatical-ly. When you attempt to do something\npainful or stressful, the limbic system\nwill urge you to stay away in order to\nprovide immediate relief (for example,\ntaking your hand\naway from a flame).\nThe prefrontal\ncortex controls\nintegrating in-formation, plan-ning, and decision making, but\nhas to be actively\nforced to work.\nSince the latter\nisn\u2019t as devel-oped, the limbic\nsystem frequently wins, leading to procrastination - until the prefrontal cortex, realising that\nthe task is urgent, eventually forces you\nto take action. Additionally, every time\nsomething pleasurable is done, dopamine is released, strengthening neuron\nconnections and reinforcing positive\nassociations with that behaviour for the\nfuture.\nThe stressful feelings accompanying\nprocrastination can be linked to the\namygdala - a brain region associated\nwith automatic emotional reactions\nand the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response against\nchallenging tasks. When activated, the\nbrain protects against possible difficul-ties, releasing adrenaline, in turn increasing levels of fear and anxiety. Interestingly, research has found that those\nwho chronically procrastinate often\nhave a larger amygdala than those who\ndon\u2019t.\nSinceprocrastinationisharmful\u2013how\ncan you minimise it? Breaking up tasks\ninto smaller chunks, and simply begin-ning, even if only for 5 minutes, will\nhelp you get started. Set yourself internal deadlines, remove temptations, for\nexample by using app/website blockers,\nand reward yourself with a 10-15-min-ute break for every 45 minutes. Finally,\nstudies show that the best treatment is\ntargeting the emotions: when you find\nsomething positive about the task it-self, it will encode a positive association\nin your brain. Remember the amazing\nfeeling of managing to complete something prior to the deadline, and, most\nimportantly, forgive yourself if it does\nhappen, so that you can start fresh next\ntime. And if someone complains about\nyour tendencies to leave work till the\nlast minute (cough cough your par-ents), you\u2019re not \u2018just lazy\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a scien-tifically-legitimate condition!\nThe Science of Procrastination\nJulia Dabrowska Science Editor\nCOVID-19 VACCINE TRACKER: Felix Edition\nPROCRASTINATION\nIS ESSENTIALLY\nA FAILURE OF\nEMOTIONAL\nMANAGEMENT\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "with a snarky narrator, much like Portal\u2019s GLaDOS,\nthe game is great fun for anyone that loves to have\ntheir brain switched on while gaming. It is also\navailable for all major consoles and PC, so whether\nyou have every piece of tech under the sun or just a\ncrappy laptop from a decade ago, you should be able\nto get the most out of this game.\nJust Dance\nUnironically, Just Dance is an amazing game\nfor making friends. It keeps you active when\nyou may be spending more time in doors\nwhen you would like. It gets everyone to\nmove in such an embarrassing fashion that\nit is the perfect ice breaker. The gameplay\nis based on dancing by copying what you\nsee on screen so anyone can play it as long\nas there is enough space for everyone to\nstand. There are a whole host of songs from\ndifferent genres to dance to, and if you pay\nfor a membership you get access to every\nsong that has ever been in a just dance game.\nWith up to 4 players locally it is the perfect\ngame for you and your non-gamer friends.\nThere has been one released every year in the\nlast decade or so, with the most recent one\nbeing aptly named Just Dance 2020 \u2013 which\nis still available on the Wii if you can believe\nit. It is also available on the Switch, PS4,\nXbox One and even Google Stadia (bet you\nforgot about that didn\u2019t you). The best part\nis that you don\u2019t even need a controller for\neveryone\u2026 as long as you have a smart phone, you\ncan download the app allowing your phone to act as\nthe controller for the game.\nI hope that I have given some good recommendations for games that will help break the ice with new\nfaces, or solidify friendships that you are already\nstarting to make. I look forward to editing the\nGames section for Felix again this year especially\nconsidering the host of releases to look forward to.\nIf anyone is interested in editing, or writing for felix,\nplease feel free to get in touch!

You follow the main\nprotagonist, Deacon Saint-John as you venture\nthrough a post-apocalytpic Oregon, doing jobs for\nvarious camps, recovering your past, and mainly just\ntrying to survive! In my 60 hours of playing I experienced every infested corner of the map, fighting\nback the triple threat of freakers (zombies), Rippers\nGame review\n(cultists that want to be zombies) and marauders\n(assholes that keep shooting me off my damn bike!).\nSpeaking of bikes... this game is unique in that it\nallows you to customise your bike just as much, if\nnot more than your own character. Upgrading the\nengine and traction may not feel like a boost, you\nwill definitely benefit from it without realising.\nApart from driving around the plagued wasteland of\nthe Western US, you also can delve deep into the story with over 150 main missions. It is a story of loss,\nfriendship and betrayal that will keep you interested\nfor the entire time.\nDays Gone really goes to show just how great\nsingle-player games can be, and I cannot wait to\nsee more from this studio. One gripe I do have\nwith the game is how overly repetetive some of the\ngameplay can get. The amount of times I had to\nthrow a molotov freaker nest, or chase down someone on my bike is uncountable. This paired with\nthe fact that half the map becomes pointless to\nreturn to as you get more powerful weapons makes\nfor the occasional feeling of redundancy.\nNevertheless, Days Gone is a fantastic experience,\nand with the upgrade to Playstation Plus coming\nwith the PS5, you should be able to play it for no\nadditional cost on launch of the PS5. I recommend\nsome good speakers because oh boy, is that sound\ntrack beautiful.\nNeed I say more...? This is MarioKart we are talking about!\nCredits: NintendoLife.com//Nintendo\n\n"

Before\nthe pandemic he could be found watching West End\nmusicals, Off-West End musicals and even Under-West End musicals every day of the week. Using\nhis sugar daddy Mr. Felix Arts, this lifestyle has not\nhad a big impact on his bank balance, while his love\nfor the finer foods has.\nIn this post-lockdown world, Eamon had to\nreplace his theatergoing personality traits with\nsomething new, so he learnt Renegade, Savage and\nSay So (not necessarily in that order). He even once\nperformed WAP on a paddle board, becoming a Wet\nAss Person in the process.\nBeyond basic bitch musicals like Wicked, Hamilton and Jamie, Eamon does enjoy modern theatre,\nespecially pieces that deal with coming of age stories\n\u2013 Soho Theatre is a great place for these. Eamon isn\u2019t\npatient enough to spend too much time in an art\ngallery but in small doses, he does find this to be very\nenjoyable -the Tate Britain is definitely a favorite of\nhis.\nWhen Eamon is not pretending to be an arts big\nshot, he enjoys eating out (to help out). Dishoom,\nShack-Fuyu and Franco Manca are a few of his\nfavorites. He also spends hours on end scouring\ncharity shops from Chelsea to Hammersmith trying\nto find another pair of corduroy trousers. If you ever\nwant recommendations on food, charity shopping or\nLondon in general, Eamon is always happy to oblige.\nHe is most easily reachable via email, TikTok DMs\na message using Monzo.

Legend has it that when he\nfirst started venturing out, he did so by leveraging the\nfree entry policy and student discount at London ven-ues. However, things have changed now, and nothing\nstops him; A 20 quid exhibition does not stand in his\nway, and it certainly doesn\u2019t help that he has made\ninroads figuring out how to obtain free press tickets\nfrom Felix.\nHe is known to be a staunch advocate of the classical and is willing to die alone on that hill (take notes\nTate Modern). Sources say that the Old Masters (be\nsure to catch his review on Titian\u2019s Poesies in this is-sue) are a personal favourite of his. Though he cannot\nshake a leg, he is also interested in the Ballet and the\nOpera. Russian performances here in London seem to\nbe an Achilles heel of his and he is often seen coveting\nBolshoi performances on YouTube and scouring the\ncatalogueoftheHermitageMuseum(Putin-beware).\nHis other interests include history and journalism,\nso if there is an event with the intersection of these,\nyou can be almost sure to sight him there. Speaking of\nthe high arts, half the time, he probably doesn\u2019t know\nwhat he is talking about, but strongly vouches to give\na balanced and well researched opinion in his articles.\nIt\u2019s easy to lure him, all you need is to start a conversation about the renaissance or the Napoleonic wars.\nHowever please beware, he has been known to bite\nyour ears off and speak endlessly on these subjects.\nThe pandemic doesn\u2019t seem to have slowed him one\nbit,andrecentwitnessessayheisboldingsteppingout\nonce again, eager as ever to bring you the latest in the\nartsy world of London.\nEditor recommendations: National Gallery, Wallace\nCollection, Tate Britain, V & A, and the British\nMuseum.\nDoctoral Candidate sighted\nnear Art Venues\nMeet the Editors\nLocation: Often found loitering The National\nGallery, British Museum or the ROH\nDates: Never hibernates\nPrices: Blatantly abuses student discount\nFelix Arts editor with a minor\nin Materials Sc. and Engg.\nLocation: Reading (for whatever reason)\nDates: Long walks on the beach\nPrices: 6.23 x 1 1023\n\n"

    "content": "This Irish sitcom has captured my heart\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nTELEVISION\nTelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n38\nThe Young Offenders\nProgram Review\nIrish sitcom The Young Offenders follows the lives\nof two mischievous teenagers Conor MacSweeney\n(played by Alex Murphy) and Jock O\u2019Keeffe (played\nby Chris Walley) as they navigate through adolescence as borderline outlaws. On the surface, the duo\nis the farthest thing from what any parent would\nwant in their children, but the show presents them in\nsuch a heartwarming and understandable way \u2013 Peter Foott, the show\u2019s creator, deserves some applause\nfor this reason alone. The show is simple, hilarious,\nand it dares you to care for those on the edge (a little\nQueen reference) without shoving the message down\nthe audience\u2019s throat.\nWith that being said, I would argue that this show\nis not excellent in a traditional sense. Yes, it is funny and relatable, but the story is clich\u00e9d, predict-able, and dare I say a little clumsy. The setting is\ntypical; the dialogues are stereotypically Irish. But\nthe characters are so full of heart that it makes the\nshow worth watching. The character development\nthroughout the seasons is incredible \u2013 their growth\nfeels organic, and it is great watching them learn to\ncare for others. I especially appreciate how the story\nmoves with the character and not the other way\naround. Many sitcoms are guilty of stereotyping their\nleads to the point that the characters lose their charm\nand come across strange as the story develops \u2013 this\nis not something to worry about with The Young\nOffenders.\nThe friendship between Conor and Jock\nConor and Jock are besties \u2013 they do anything and\neverything together all the time. They rock the same\nhairstyles, get the same piercings, and wear the same\ncolourful tracksuits as they wander around Cork\nstealing bikes under their funny masks. Their outward appearances may look questionable, but there\nis no question that they truly care for each other,\nthough in a very cheesy and stupid way. Even if the\nentire world leaves the two of them behind, they will\nstill always be there for each other. Conor defends\nJock when everyone thinks he is a jerk \u2013 Jock has\nnever blamed anyone for his misfortunes; in that\nsame way, Jock always sees the best in Conor. It\nwarms my heart to see two silly young boys who are\nwilling to help each other unconditionally \u2013 Murphy\nand Walley\u2019s amazing chemistry alongside Foott\u2019s\nnatural and witty writing both play important roles\nin the delivery of the two characters.\n\u2018I love me mam\u2019\nM\u00e1ir\u00e9ad MacSweeney (played by Hilary Rose) is yet\nanother highlight of the show. She is the mother of\nConor and widower of Conor\u2019s father. Rose\u2019s portrayal of M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad is realistic, hilarious, and endearing\nas it can be. She is a fish butcher at Cork\u2019s market,\nand she raises Conor who she had at sixteen all by\nherself after Conor\u2019s father\u2019s passing. She cares for\nConor, and she wants the best for him; she gets mad\nfrom time to time but still tries to guide him when he\nfeels lost. As much as she dislikes Jock, she does not\nhesitate a single bit to save him from his alcoholic,\nabusive father.\n\u2018I love me mam\u2019 is the reference of the matching\ntattoos that Conor and Jock get. There is a soft spot\nin their heart for their mothers \u2013 and it is yet another clear reminder that they are not bad people, they\nreally are just kids riddled with ridiculous stupidity,\nbut underneath it all they have a loving heart.\nBilly Murphy\nBilly Murphy (played by Shane Casey) is an interesting character that adds dimension to the storyline.\nHe is a local bully who is mentally unstable; he used\nThe Young Offenders\nReviewed by Jia Qi Tan Television Editor\nStarring: Alex Murphy, Chris Walley\nEpisodes: 6 (30 minutes) (3 seasons)\nCredits: Courtesy of RTE\nBesties Jock (Chris Walley) and Conor (Alex Murphy).\nto mug Conor and Jock, went to jail, and developed\nan odd relation with the MacSweeneys. This is a\nsimple example of how The Young Offenders incorporated a peculiar character naturally that complements the plot without him seeming out of place.\nConclusion\nAt its core I believe that Peter Foott is trying to\nsend out a positive message with this show \u2013 steal-ing, being teen parents, failing school, etc. \u2013 this\nis not the sort of life the society encourages, yet he\nmanages to show the charm of it, how the main\ncharacters are trying to be happy and make sense\nof their lives. It is written in a way that we can\nempathize with those who are a little awkward, a\nlittle problematic but kind and loving. All in all, I\nenjoyed the show and would recommend it to all\nof you if you are in the mood for a heartwarming\njourney.\n\n"

The current Unconscious\nBias and Active Bias training are ineffective in tackling the existing culture in\nthe college. Staff are reluctant to engage\nin anti-discrimination speech and advocacy for fear of failure. There is zero\npersonal accountability for implicit,\nand sometimes explicit, complicity by\nstaff in furthering the non-inclusive,\nnon-diverse, and at times hostile status\nquo.\na. Reduce the size of the workshop\nto encourage greater personal impact\non workshop attendees.\nb. Replace the current one-off tick\nbox Active Bystander Training and Unconscious Bias training with higher frequencies of Anti-Discrimination Work\nand Anti-Institutional Racism Classes.\nA Guardian investigation conducted in over 131 universities found that\nout, of 996 formal complaints of rac-ism, only 367 were upheld. Of the complaints made against students only 78\nstudentsfacedsuspensionsorexpulsion,\nand of complaints against staff, only 51\nstaff faced dismissal or resigned (Batty,\n2019). It is clear that universities pri-oritise their reputation over protecting\nand supporting the students and staff\nof minority backgrounds. Those tasked\nwith addressing these complaints either\nreceive minimal training or are dismissive of the systemic racism endemic to\ntheir communities.\nPriyamvada Gopal, a reader at the\nfaculty of English at Cambridge University, said complaints of racism were\nmet with \u201crace illiteracy\u201d: \u201cComplainants get exhausted and give up simply\nbecause there is no comprehension of\nwhat racism is. There is either outright\ndenial, \u2018gaslighting\u2019 or minimising...\nThere are few mechanisms and still fewer trained staff able to deal with race\nmatters\u201d (Batty, 2019). Therefore, we\ndemand the department to:\n3. Establish a Racial Misconduct\nLiaison Team to provide thorough support to students and staff in reporting\nracial harassment and other form of\nracial misconduct. The responsibilities\nof this team must include, but are not\nlimited to:\na. Provide 1-2-1 support to staff\nand students experiencing racial harass-ment, as well as personal guidance and\nstep-by-step help for victims to formally\nreport said incidents to College Disciplinary Panels with due recognition of\nthe harassment\u2019s racial category.\nb. Collaborate with the College\nDisciplinary Panel to mandate anti-bi-as, anti-racism and institutional racism\nclasses to racial misconduct perpetra-tors,ontopofotherdisciplinaryactions\nas stated in paragraph 64 in Ordinance\nE2 (College Council, 2018).\nThroughout the policies and initiatives enacted, higher education insti-tutions, Imperial College London in-cluded, have hidden true accountability\nunder the acronym of BAME. This initialism reduces students of diverse identities to a single, homogenous group;\na group where the vast range of racial,\ncultural and ethnic experiences, and\nstructural inequalities unique to each\nminority group are erased and invali-dated. For this reason, we demand that\ninitiatives created and policies made\nfor under-represented communities be\nmade with the under-represented com-munities.\n4. Establish an Equity and Equality\nStudent-Led committee as means of\ncontinuous ongoing feedback into the\nwork of the EDDCC and Senior Management Team. This committee will\nmeet up with the Senior Management\nTeam and EDDCC to expedite additional initiatives and structural reform.\nA significant step to institutional\naccountability is public accountability.\nIt is for this reason that, we call upon\nthe department to dismantle its system\nof information gatekeeping under the\nguise of GPDR compliance and engage in public acts of data transparency.\nWe call for the data to be disaggregate\nwhere relevant, and findings published\nto the Mechanical Engineering cohort\nand its alumni, with respect to:\n5. Provide transparency in demographic data including details in attain-ment, access, and progression in the\ndepartment with due diligence done to\ncomply with GPDR Approval. Actively\ndisclose reasons as to why said data is\ninappropriate for disaggregation if that\nis the case.\na. Moreover, engage in staff & student forums and town hall meetings,\nwhere department administrators are\nin communication with the wider cohort to disseminate data, clarify infor-mation, and answers questions students\nmight have.\nThe Department of Mechanical Engineering is a department that respects\nequality, inclusion, and equity, but\nwords alone will not eliminate the racial challenges and barriers faced by students of these minorities. It is in times\nlike this that the department must act,\nnot only to reject its ties to Imperial\u2019s\ndeeply racist past, but also set out an\ninclusive and equitable future for all its\nstaff and students.\nWe stand with the men, women and\nchildren abused, brutalised, and murdered at the violent hands of racism,\nanti-Blackness, white supremacy, and\nwhite nationalism.

    "content": "Current and former bar staff working in the Imperial college union\nbars have spoken out against the way\ntheyweretreatedbymanagementinthe\nUnion. Felix has heard how staff members reliant on the bar for rent and food\nmoney, were treated as thieves and had\ntheir freedoms slashed away.\nComplaints allege that the implementation of the new Commercial\nstrategy in 2018 resulted in the decline\ninqualityofalltheUnionmanagedbars\nas well as revenues. Before the Commercial strategy in 2018 the bar had\nmanaged to maintain consistent profits\nfor the previous 6 years. However, upon\nits implementation expenditure grew\nby \u00a3300,000 a year while income fell, in\nreal terms.\nThis increase in expenditure can be\nattributed in part to the rise in agency\nstaff fees that became necessary due to\nthe effect that the policy\u2019s focus on increasing food sales and cutting staffing\ncosts had. Staff report how the 2 chefs\nthat could fit into the kitchen had to\ndeal with +40o\nC temperature as they\nworked over constantly on grills, pizza ovens and deep fat fryers to provide\nfreshly cooked food, a key component\nof the policy. These conditions lead to\nthe resignation of many of the chefs requiring the hiring of even more agency\nstaff.\nThe culture of the Union at that time\nwas criticised. Working there involved\n\u201cawful mind games and horrible comments\u201d according to one former sabbatical officer, while student staff were\ndescribed as \u201cresources\u201d.\n\u201cBefore [2018], we had three great\nmanagers. But within 6 months of [the\npolicy being implemented] they had\nall left. I don\u2019t think that was a coincidence\u201d said a staff member who asked\nto remain anonymous.\nThe process of replacing them was\nhandled \u201cincompetent[ly]\u201d with student staff relied on to fill out paper-work, place orders, hire security and\neven in one case, log their own hours.\nHowever, despite this staff were regarded as the reason for the falling revenues\nand were \u201ctreated as thieves\u201d with the\npossibility of staff being searched on\narrival and departure for cash being\nraised.\nA former staff member described the\ncampaign against them as \u201cludicrous.\nThey clearly had no idea how the tills\nworked\u201d.\nStaff also have seen their perks being\nwithdrawn. The Food and Drink Policy implemented in November 2018 by\nthe same architects of the Commercial\nstrategy policy replaced a 60-70% discount on a small list of items (the \u2018at\ncost price\u2019) with a flat 15% discount on\nall menu items. Staff were also forbidden from drinking coffee from the machine that was used to serve customers.\nInstead they were given instant coffee,\nthat was more expensive than the beans\nused in the customer coffee, in \u201cspite\u201d.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nNEWS\nNews.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nUnion bar staff speak out against\nCredits: Calum Drysdale\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief\nOnly 2 chefs can work in this small cramped space that can reach +40o\nC\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\nBleach beers and haram burgers\nBar staff have also condemned\nthe arbitrary and unprofessional\nmanagement styles of some previous\ntop members of the Union.\nStaff describe the dysfunctional\nway that favourites were picked, and\npeople were leaned on to make them\ndo work beyond their paygrade with\nthe promise of promotion dangled in\nfront of them, while those that raised\nissues with staff treatment were\n\u2018blacklisted\u2019. One staff member describes the response they received to\ncomplaints about working conditions\nwas being described as \u201cdifficult\u201d and\nthat management \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand\n[them]\u201d.\nWill Shepard, a recently promoted\nsupervisor at the time, was encouraged to \u201cprove himself\u201d capable of\npromotion by arriving an hour early\nfor his shifts to complete managerial paperwork with the promise of a\npromotion to manager without an interview process held out as a reward.\nWhen complaints were raised about\nthis by other staff members who felt\noverlooked by Shepard\u2019s promotion\nthe response was that \u201cWill been promoted by me as in my right and position is to promote any staff member\nif they are suitable for the position\nwithout any application process. Will\nis only duty [H] bar manger not the\n568, if there will be a position for 568\nopen I will open application for anyone but currently nobody is suitable\nfor the role anyway[sic]\u201d\nIt has also been alleged that staff\nmembers were pressured into taking\nshifts by being taken into the office,\nthe self-locking door was closed behind them and urged to work more\nshifts, being forced to turn down\neach available vacant spot shift when\nalready working more than 20 hours\na week.\nPicking favourites\nin the Union bars\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief\nmornings.\nThe permanent supervisor was expected to begin the cleaning, a 3-4 hour\njob, \u201cat 2 am after a busy night\u201d said a\nstudent manager at the time. He was\none of only 3 permanent supervisors\n\u201cwhen we needed 4\u201d said Drew Loynes,\nformer bar staff student supervisor. On\ntop of this \u201cbecause the management\nthought [the student bar staff] were\nstealing they insisted that a permanent\nstaff manager or supervisor was on\nevery shift\u201d forcing already overworked\npermanent staff supervisors to work\nlong double shifts and weekend shifts\nwhen having multiple managers was\nunnecessary.\nThe staff member that identified the\ndrink as contaminated was taken to\nhospital but suffered no long-term con-sequences. The condition of the original customer is unknown.\nThe sale of non-halal burgers occurred on a freshers\u2019 move in day in\n2018. The mistake was noticed a day\nor two later and it is alleged that senior managers in the Union, decided\nagainst informing students as, according to a manager at the time, \u201cnot many\nwere sold\u201d. However, due to a till malfunction at the time all staff members\nwere having to record their purchases\non paper rather than through the tills,\nleaving the total number of burgers sold\nunknown.\n\n"

A once in a life\ntime opportunity to have the privileges of being treated as an adult, but\nwithout the responsibility of paying bills.But as students of Imperial,\nwe also know all too well that it can\nalso be a stressful experience when it\ncomes to coursework and exam season.\nThat\u2019s why, in this very first sustainability column article of this academic\nyear, we\u2019ll be providing you with simple tips on how you can make a positive impact on the planet without\noverwhelming yourself. After all, we\nalready have a lot on our plates. All actionable takeaways mentioned in this\narticle have been ranked in order of\nhow impactful they are, along with 3\nquickfacts about why you should care.\nWe recommend that you make a gradual transition towards a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. When it\ncomes to sustainable living, its much\nbetter to have everyone doing it im-perfectly, than just a handful of individuals trying to master it perfectly.\nBut before getting into the nitty-gritty\ndetails, it\u2019s also important to remember\nthat one of the most meaningful ways\nyou can help our planet is to reduce\nyourconsumptioningeneral. ThemainstreamWesternperspectiveonsustaina-bility is focused on one small part of the\nproblem while ignoring broader global\nissues. We cannot create sustainability\nby buying 'sustainable' things that we\ndon't need in the first place. There is\nalso a lot of focus on recycling, rather than reducing and reusing, because\nthis allows us to consume while simply being an extension of the throw\naway culture driving environmental\ndegradation. Sustainability is not what\nwe buy. It is how we live our lives.\nWiththatinmind, here\u2019s yourtoolkitto\nliving better - for your wellbeing, that\nof our planet, and those around you.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nMonami Miyamoto Sustainability Editor Fashion\nQuick facts:\n1) The fashion industry is\nthe 2nd largest polluter\nafter aviation\n2) Microplastics comprise\n35% of oceanic waste, many which come from\nwashing of synthetic fibre clothes\n3) Over 90% of workers in the garment industry\ncannot negotiate wages or conditions\nActionable takeaways:\nLow impact: If you\u2019re purchasingsomething new,\ninvestigate the ethics of production. Watch out for\nsigns of greenwashing, which is when brands use\nmisleading information to portray their operations\nas more environmentally friendly than they actually\nare. Being curious about where your products come\nfrom is a good starting place to vote with your\nconsumption choices.\nMedium impact: Stop purchasing fast fashion. This\nnot only includes specific brands but also avoiding\npurchase based on trends, impulse, discounts, Black\nFriday events, etc. You can instead opt for 2nd hand\nclothes or organise a clothes swap with friends.\nHigh impact: Write an email to your favourite\nclothing brand or policymaker about what they\u2019re\ndoing to address global issues. Ask for information\nregarding gender equality, safe working conditions,\nfair pay, modern slavery, water contamination,\nwaste, landfill, carbon emissions, animal welfare,\nocean plastic and deforestation. Many people don\u2019t\nbother doing this, which is why it\u2019s incredibly\nimpactful if you do.\nQuick facts:\n1) 30% of food produced globally for human consumption is wasted or lost; this produces emissions\nof up to 4.4 billion tonnes of CO2\n2) 6.6 million tonnes of household food are wasted\neach year in the UK, and 70% of this was edible \u2013\nthat\u2019s worth approximately \u00a314 billion\n3) Of all wasted food, the largest proportion is fresh\nvegetables and salad, that make up 28% of the total\nActionable takeaways:\nLow impact: Cook with flatmates or friends. Not\nonly is this a great way to spend time together, but\nyou end up saving a lot more energy, water and ingredients compared to cooking just for one person.\nMedium impact: Avoid clutter in the fridge. Being\nable to see what you have means that you\u2019re less likely to forget that there\u2019s a rotting piece of fruit at the\nback of the shelf which will be wasted. Organising\nonce every few days also gives you a chance to check\nexpiry dates of products (although remember that\nthese are just general guidelines).\nHigh impact: Start looking into businesses tackling\nthis food waste. For example, OLIO is an app that\nallows you to sell/buy food that people no longer\nwant but are edible. ODDBOX is a produce delivery that rescues fruits and vegetables from farms that\nwould otherwise have been\nthrown away because of their\nodd shapes. 2Good2Go is an\napp that partners with restaurants which have leftover\nfood at the end of the day,\nready to be sold at a discounted price.\nFood Waste\nQuick facts:\n1) Beef and lamb meat\ncontribute to 250x the\nGHG emissions per gram\nof protein than plant\nprotein crops\n2) The livestock industry\naccounts for 18% of GHG\nemissions, 64% ammonia emissions, 8% global\nwater use, 70% global agricultural land\n3) Meat consumption is expected to increase by\n26% from 2007 to 2050\nActionable takeaways:\nLow impact: If you\u2019re a meat-eater and can\u2019t see\nyourself giving up meat, don\u2019t worry. You can still\nmake a difference by opting for chicken instead of\nbeef or lamb, which has significantly lower environmental impacts. You can also try experimenting\nwith vegan or vegetarian options that are available\nat most restaurants in London now.\nMedium impact: Reduce the intake of animal\nproducts, including meat and dairy. You don\u2019t have\nto switch your diet entirely as this can be daunting.\nSimply choosing to have a no-meat-Monday, or\nlimiting meat consumption to weekends is still a\nmeaningful lifestyle change. You mignt start to notice that it also affects aspects of your health, such\nas quality of sleep, energy levels and digestion.\nHigh impact: Eat a diet made up of local produce\nand plant-rich ingredients. Whilst it can be hard to\neat entirely local in the modern globalised world, a\nquick google search will give you many businesses\nthat work in London to provide consumers with\nlocal organic produce. Try investigating some so\nthat you can do your part to support the planet and\nBritish farmers.\nFood Choice\nQuick facts:\n1) In 2017, 46.2% of UK plastic packaging was\ncollected for recycling, and of this only 34% was\nrecycled in the UK, with the rest exported, often to\ncountries with inadequate waste infrastructure\n2) Globally, 8 million tonnes of plastic packaging\nenter the oceans each year\n3) Plastic items can take up to 1000 years until they\nfully decompose\nActionable takeaways:\nLow impact: Recycle properly\nby following guidelines of\nyour local area. This includes\nsimple things like washing out the food containers.\nMake sure you're not \u2018wish-cycling\u2019 - when we recycle items that we think or hope can be recycled, but\nactually can't, and cause problems at recycling centres by contaminating recycling streams.

But wait! What\nif I ran out of good shows to watch?\nAmazon prime?\nDon\u2019t be silly.\nWith this haunting reality in the back of my mind,\nI picked up a book and came across this gem: How\nto Win Friends and Influence People. A book, I\nthought, would be ideal to share with you fresh-ers trying to settle in as well as some of you older\nfolk who\u2019ve suffered an extended, socially stripped\nlockdown.\nI wasn\u2019t very intrigued by the book at first, given\nits \u2018I have no friends, please help me\u2019 title. I still\nremember the first few shameful days nearly being\ncaught on the train mid-read, or by my mum\nwalking into my room with the title nearly visible\nthrough my fingers. So, what swayed me? What\nmade me overlook this eyesore of a title and carry\non reading? Warren Buffett. Yes, the one man who\ncan turn the hopeless into the hopeful, admitting\nto how, and I quote, \u2018[Carnegie] changed my life\u2019.\nWith that in mind, let us get into this review. Alright\u2026the title still bugs me.\nBut we\u2019ll overlook it. Please.\nCarnegie, the writer of the book for those of you\nstill pondering over the ignominious title, uses\none of Sigmund Freud\u2019s most recognised psychoanalytic theories to illustrate his fundamental argument that \u2018everything you and I do springs from\ntwo motives: the sex urge and the desire\nBook review\n\u2018[Carnegie] changed my life\u2019 \u2013 Warren Buffet\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\nReviewed by Hari Kumarakurupara Books Editor\nBy Dale Carnegie\nTALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT\nTHEMSELVES AND THEY\u2019LL\nLISTEN FOR HOURS.\n\u201c\nto be great\u2019, further articulated by Dr. Dewey, \u2018one\nof America\u2019s most profound philosophers\u2019, who\nsaid that \u2018the deepest urge in human nature is the\ndesire to be important\u2019. This idea that we have a\n\u2018desire to be important\u2019 is ubiquitous in Carnegie\u2019s\ntext and is the foundation upon which he shows us\n\u2018How to Win Friends and Influence People\u2019.\nAs egotistical and self-absorbed as it sounds, we\nall have a \u2018desire to be important\u2019. Even me, as I\nwrite this article. I foolishly thought that I wrote\nthis article to help you lead more productive and\nhappy lives. But no! Deep within, it makes me feel\nimportant. Apply it to anything, go on, any \u2018righteous and honourable\u2019 thing you\u2019ve done, be it to\nsave a cat from a tree or giving to charity, it could\nbe argued that there is a hidden element of feeling\nimportant. Carnegie\u2019s text is thus moulded around\nthis crushing reality.\nPublished in 1937, many argue the book to be\n\u2018outdated\u2019, however I believe the methods within\nthis book to be timeless and, quite frankly, a breath\nof fresh air compared to the constant cathartic huff\nand puff I find on social media.\nCarnegie explores plenty of methods on \u2018How to\nWin Friends and Influence People\u2019, induced by\nmaking people \u2018feel important\u2019. Three methods that\nparticularly resonated with me were: being genuinely interested in people, smiling, and remembering one\u2019s name. Some of these may sound simple\nbut I\u2019ve been guilty of not following, well, all of\nthem.\nFirst, we\u2019ll deal with being genuinely interested in\npeople. We learn best through experience, and the\nnext best thing is someone else\u2019s experience. In this\nbook, Carnegie skilfully uses many experiences\nand stories from households to historical figures\nlike Abraham Lincoln and Napoleon the Third,\nallowing you to truly understand and appreciate\nthe rules discussed in the book. With this rule, the\nkey word is \u2018genuine\u2019, and Carnegie highlights this\nmany a time. Genuine interest sparks conversation\nand can lead to everlasting relationships, be it at\nthe workplace or a social environment. Believe or\nnot, both sides benefit. A way of putting this into\npractice, if possible, is doing your research. Knowing a bit more about the person so you can ask\nthose questions you so desire to be answered and\nbefore you know it, you\u2019ve made another friend -hooray? Carnegie puts this best when he\nsays \u2018talk to someone about themselves and\nthey\u2019ll listen for hours\u2019. This quote does somewhat neglect the nature of being \u2018genuine\u2019, but it\nshines light on the fact that everyone wants to\n\u2018feel important\u2019, and that talking about oneself\ncan be an enjoyable sport for some more than\nothers.\nSecond is a smile. A startling, almost supernatural expression when we look at London\u2019s public\ntransport users who prefer to wear the popular\ndeadpan, dethatched straight-face as their choice\nof expression. Seeing someone smile on the tube\nis extraordinary, almost inconceivable. Charles\nSchwab was one of these extraordinary individuals whose \u2018smile had been worth a million\ndollars\u2019. What does a smile say? A smile says, \u2018I\nlike you. You make me happy. I am glad to see\nyou\u2019. Again, Carnegie stresses \u2018a real smile, a\nheart-warming smile\u2026\u2019 bringing back the idea\nof being genuine, rather than mechanical. Try\nsmiling at someone in your workplace or wher-ever, and you\u2019ll most likely receive one in return.\nLastly, remembering one\u2019s name. This is such\na small and simple courtesy but many people,\nincluding myself, don\u2019t bother to remember\nnames. Past historical figures, like Napoleon the\nThird, took it so far as to write down names he\nfound difficult or felt were especially important\nand made sure to memorise and associate the\nname with the person. Carnegie speaks of the\n\u2018magic\u2019 contained in a name and discusses how\nthe name of an individual \u2018sets the individual\napart; it makes him or her unique among all\nothers\u2019. Again, it makes them \u2018feel important\u2019. So,\nthe next time you go to your favourite caf\u00e9, try\nand address the worker behind the counter by\ntheir name. This can be done by having a peek\nat their name badge or simply by asking because\n\u2018remember that a person\u2019s name is to that person\nthe sweetest and most important sound in any\nlanguage\u2019.\nTo get the most out of this book, I\u2019d recommend\nputting the methods into practice. Carnegie\neven wrote an introduction, \u2018How to get the\nmost out of this book\u2019, where he stresses that the\ntechniques and skills mentioned in the book\ncan only be acquired when put into practice.\nLike any skill, \u2018we learn by doing\u2026learning is an\nactive process\u2019.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nNEWS\n3\nNews.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nOne of the many ill-effects of the\ncurrent pandemic has been its\nimpact on international travel, and\nfew countries have been more affected than China. Due a complex mix\nof governmental policy, international\npolitics and pandemic measures, the\nnumber of flights between the UK\nand China has been far lower than\nusual.\nFor the thousands of Imperial\nstudents and offer holders living in\nChina, this means being effectively\nstranded in their home country for\nthe start of the academic year. Prices\nfor flights to London are often prohibitively high, and availability is scarce.\nWhat\u2019s more bookings are often cancelled at short notice, resulting in\nenormous financial uncertainty. One\nPhD student in the Civil Engineering\ndepartment recalled how he spent\n\u201cmore than \u00a36000 on tickets\u201d while\nstill not having a confirmed flight\nhome. Such cases are not unique ei-ther, says the Graduate Student Union (GSU) president Zixiao Wang.\nAccording to a GSU survey of 1328\nnew and current Imperial students in\nChina, 98% hope for the College to\narrange private charter flights from\nvarious cities back to London. Such a\nsolution wouldn\u2019t\nbe without prec-edent. Recently\nQueen\u2019s University Belfast, Exeter University,\nand others have\nconfirmed similar plans to get\nstudents back to\nthe UK in time for the start of term,\nhighlighting the national scale of the\nproblem: there are currently over\n120,000 Chinese students studying in\nthe UK, many of whom will be facing\nthis issue directly.\nThe uncertainty of the situation is\na massive cause for concern for Mr.\nWang. \u201cI think the impact is very sig-nificant. There are more than 2000\nstudents at Imperial in China facing\nthis problem. What I want to emphasise is that this isn\u2019t just 2000 students,\nbut 2000 families\u201d. He says the impact\nwill be felt not just practically (re-searchers face \u201cdisaster\u201d without access to their labs),\nbut also in terms\nof the value families feel that they\u2019re\ngetting: \u201cthey\u2019re\npaying to study in\nLondon\u201d.\nIn view of the\nnational scale of\nthe problem, the\nGSU has called on the College to\n\u201ctake a leading role\u201d in its alleviation.\nIn response to Felix\u2019s request for com-ment, an Imperial College London\nspokesperson said: \u201cWe know some\nof our international students are facing difficulties getting to Imperial for\nthe start of term [\u2026] and we are doing all we can to support them. We\ncontinue to make the case for more\nflights to airlines and are exploring\nvarious options to help our students\nexperiencing this problem. We will\nupdate affected students as soon as\nwe can.\u201d\nThey went on to say that a \u201cwide\nrange of innovative educational experiences such as virtual labs and\nfield trips\u201d will be used to mitigate\nthe potential harm, specifically citing\nthe use of VR for radiology training\nin the medical school, and reassured\nstudents that \u201cour global student\ncommunity is part of what makes\nstudying at Imperial such a rich ex-perience. International students will\ncontinue to receive a warm welcome\nby Imperial wherever in the world\nthey are studying - remotely or in\nperson.\u201d For many however, these reassurances may not be enough.\nGSU lobbies College to bring\nstranded Chinese students to London\nNick Manrique News reporter\nImperial top for graduate prospects says The Times\nPublication of the Times Good\nUniversity Guide 2021 has seen\nImperial top the national league tables\nfor graduate prospects with more than\n95% of graduates in high skilled employment or post graduate study 15\nmonths within 15 months of gradua-tion. It also led amongst leading universities on its spending on services and\nfacilities.\nIn the overall rankings however,\nImperial performed less well, slipping\ndown a place in the from 4th to 5th behind Cambridge, Oxford, St Andrews\nand LSE which moved up two places\nfrom last year to displace Imperial. The\nfall in Imperial\u2019s position reverses the\ngain made between 2019 and 2020.\nThese rankings were determined\nusing 8 metrics (entry standards, stu-dent-staff ratios, student satisfaction,\nservicesandfacilitiesspend,completion\nrates, first-class and 2:1 degrees, graduate prospects and research quality) with\nstudent satisfaction and research quality being weighted at 1.5.\nThe main drivers of Imperial\u2019s fall in\nposition were poor teaching quality,\ncompletion rate and the student-staff\nratio that put it below LSE, despite outperforming the other London university in a number of other fields and coming second in the country for research\nquality.\nWhile the top of the leader board was\nfairly static there was significant movement further down with Durham (6th),\nLancaster (=10th) and Loughborough\n(7th) falling and Bath (9th), UCL (8th)\nand Bristol (13th) rising up the table.\nThe guide also highlighted major issues with Imperial teaching quality that\nit ranked as 117th in the country as\nwell as social inclusion where it ranked\n112th with a black attainment gap of\n-7% beating only Cambridge, Durham, Oxford and Bristol. The Guide\nacknowledges, however, that outreach\nand access programs are having a positive effect.\nOxford was named as the University\nof the year for the work by the University\u2019s first female vice chancellor in admitting students that had been downgraded by the government\u2019s results\nalgorithm and its work on the COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe results of The Times/The Sunday Good University Guide 2021 can\nbe read at www.thetimes.co.uk and is\none of several university ranking guides.\n5th\nbest overall ranking for university in\nthe country\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief\n117th\nranking for\nsocial inclusion\nTHIS ISN\u2019T JUST\n2000 STUDENTS,\nBUT 2000 FAMILIES\n\u201c\n57th\nranking for\nstudent experience\n\n"

However, given the\ncollaborative nature of performances\nand the vital role audiences play in the\nrunning of performing arts societies,\nthese societies clearly have their work\ncut out for them.\nWe reached out to the presidents\nof four major performing arts societies - Imperial College Drama Society\n(DramSoc), Imperial College Musical\nTheatre Society (MTSoc), ICSM Drama and ICSM Light Opera and asked\nthem to weigh in on how COVID-19\nhas affected them so far, and what their\nplans were looking ahead at the upcoming academic year.\nDISCLAIMER: The information\nprovided below is based on the current\ngovernment and college guidelines as\nof the third week of September. As the\nCOVID-19 situation is rapidly evolv-ing, it is possible that further changes will have to be made, accounting\nfor changing guidelines. Please get in\ntouch with the respective society to get\nthe most up to date information. Stay\nsafe and welcome (or welcome back!)\nto London.\nCOVID-19 has affected us all in so\nmany ways and going forward, this is\ngoing to fundamentally shape life on\ncampus. Could you tell us a bit on what\na normal year\u2019s schedule would be like\nfor your society, in terms of productions and performances, had it not been\nfor the pandemic?\nDramSoc: October Show is generally the first show we put on in the year,\nwhere we have a double-act with MTSoc, and put on original plays. Then,\nwe have a main show in each term,\nand these are great ways [for us] to\nshowcase both our techies\u2019 and actors\u2019\nskills. We have had some great plays\nin the past like \u2018The Resistible Rise of\nArturo Ui\u2019 and \u2018And Then There Were\nNone\u2019. DramSoc gets heavily involved\nin events like the Summer Ball, SilFest,\nM Night and East Meets West, setting up all the big lights and speakers!\nAlthough hard work, these events are\nusually some of the most enjoyable for\nthe techies. During the\nSummer Break, we usu-allyhaveacoupleofour\nactors perform their\nown original pieces,\nwhich they thoroughly\nenjoy. We\u2019ve had some\ngood success there too,\nwith our last show,\nCompost, getting great\nreviews!\nMTSoc: During Autumn Term, following the October show we have our\nRevue! This is a compilation of musical\nnumbers from a range of musicals, all\ndirected by society members. In Spring\nTerm, we run our biggest production,\nSpring Show. Previous shows have included Sweeney Todd, RENT, Legally\nBlonde, and Footloose. Since 2019,\nwe have also run a small-scale Studio\nShow alongside Spring Show to accommodate for our growing society, with\na smaller cast, and offering more creative flexibility to the directing team.\nWe usually end the year with a 24-hour\nmusical in Summer term. The show is\nkept completely secret until 24 hours\nbefore doors open; the cast, band,\nand crew then work throughout the\nnight and day to get everything perfor-mance-ready! We also host termly cabarets where anyone can sign up to sing a\nsong of their choosing, and in February\nwe have a Very Vocal Evening, which is\na collaborative night of performances\nfrom MTSoc and A Cappella.\nICSM Drama: We normally put\non 2 large productions which are performed at Union Concert Hall - one in\nNovember (Autumn Play) and one in\nMarch (Main Play). We also perform 3\nsmaller plays throughout the year. One\nWeek Play is our preterm play where\ncast and crew have one week to rehearse\nand learn their lines, Christmas Play\nwhich is performed in early December.\nAnd lastly, Fresher\u2019s Plays at the beginning of first term, which are written by\nourolderyearsandinwhichallFreshers\nwho audition get a part. Fresher\u2019s Plays\nare a brilliant way for new members of\nthe society to\nget to know\neach other as\nwell as older\nyears. We also\nnormally have\nregular socials\nand rehearsals,\nand a weekend\naway to a secret location at\nthe end of first term, as well as academic\nsupport, tutorials, and mock exams for\nthe medical students.\nICSM Light Opera: Light Opera\nhosts two shows a year. The first is our\nMain Opera production, which is a\nmusical at the end of the Autumn term.\nThesecondoneisa24-hourproduction\nin the summer term which, as its name\nsuggests, is a full musical which is all\nprepared in just 24 hours! We also host\nBigChill,anopenmicnightintheReynold\u2019s Bar, which occurs at least once a\nterm. Throughout the year we also have\nregular socials, as well as our Opera\nTour and our fabulous Opera Dinner!\nHave you had any productions from\nlast academic year halted? If so, can we\nexpect these to be staged this year?\nDramSoc: We\u2019ve unfortunately had\nto cancel our Summer term main and\nour Edinburgh Fringe performances\nthis year, as well as the October show.\nBoth Edinburgh Fringe and October\nshow performances are original plays\nthat our members\u2019 have written, so we\nwere really disappointed that we had to\ncancel, but we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019ll be\nable to put these plays on later in the\nyear!\nMTSoc: Our 2020 studio show,\n\u2018About Last Night\u2019, was unfortunately cancelled just hours before opening\nnight due to the lockdown in March.\nAs a lot of the directing team and cast\nhave now graduated, it\u2019s unlikely this\nwill be staged this year.

    "content": "FRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\n23\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nThere is no arguing that 2020 has\nbeen a dumpster fire of a year for\npretty much everyone. Of all the horrible things COVID-19 has caused, theatres closing may appear quite insignifi-cant. However, due to the sheer volume\nof jobs lost (artists, front of house staff,\nbackstage crew etc.), the industry has\nhad to adapt new ways to keep people\nengaged with the marvels of live thea-tre. Therefore, in the six months that\nthe West End has been shut down, there\nhave been fantastic attempts at bringing\nthe theatre into our homes, helping it\nbecome more accessible than ever be-fore. Very early on during lockdown,\nas current productions kept extending\ntheir hiatuses and upcoming productions kept announcing enormous delays\nto their opening dates, various schemes\nwere announced by major players in\nthe London theatre scene to help keep\ntheatre somewhat alive. Perhaps the\ntwo most notable examples to this are\nNational Theatre\u2019s \u2018NT at Home\u2019 pro-gramme, and Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s\n\u2018The Show Must Go On\u2019 scheme.\nBoth schemes released previously\nfilmed performances for free on their\nYouTube channels\nat a specific time\nweekly, vaguely emulating the feeling\nof being in an au-dience, sharing the\ntheatregoing experience with millions\nof others. Brilliantly, for those who\ncouldn\u2019t make the\ninitial viewing win-dow, the recordings\nwere kept online\nfor a week, allowing\nthem to be watched\nat one\u2019s pleasure,\nallowing for each\nproduction to reach\na global audience that\u2019s as wide as possi-ble. In fact, according to National Theatre, over 10 million people engaged\nwith their scheme, which is roughly\nequivalent to 4000 performances across\nall the National Theatre venues at full\ncapacity! \u2018NT at Home\u2019 included some\nfantastic productions such\nas the fresh yet\nfaithful adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018Antony\n& Cleopatra\u2019\nstarring Ralph\nFiennes and\nSophie Okonedo, \u2018A Streetcar\nNamed Desire\u2019\nstarring the\niconic Gillian\nAnderson and\n\u2018Frankenstein\u2019\nstarring Benedict Cumberbatch. \u2018The\nShow Must Go On\u2019 had a fantastic\nselection of Lloyd Webber-composed\nmusicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar\nand \u2018Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\u2019. Both schemes\nalso encouraged donations to support\nnot only the theatre industry, but also\nNHS-related charities.\nAs lockdown eased and things normal-ised, other theatres joined in on the\nfun, and some with brand new content,\nsome of which aired live from the stage,\nfilmed with no audience. For example,\nClaire Foy and Matt Smith performed\ntheir acclaimed production of Duncan MacMillan\u2019s Lungs on the Old Vic\nstage, charging a fee to be allowed into\nthe remote audience. The audience was\nasked to pay between \u00a310 and \u00a365, although each ticket, regardless of the\nprice, got the audience members the\nsame view.\nWith the return of open-air and socially distanced performances, the age\nof remote and free theatre has already\nslowed down significantly. However, if\nairing these shows has got a handful of\nyoung people interested in the performing arts, I say we should be happy that it\nhappened, not sad because it\u2019s over.\nThroughout my position as an Arts\nEditor, I have been a big supporter of\nmaking theatre more accessible, trying\nto draw attention to all the different\nways the industry has done this over\nthe years, and also to the many shortcomings that the theatre industry has\nplaced upon themselves in this aspect.\nTherefore, it has been really interesting to me that all it took to share the\ngift of theatre with the whole world,\nwithout asking for extortionate prices\nor having to partake in weekly lotteries\nwith miniscule chances of ever winning\n(looking at you, Hamilton) was a pan-demic. Of course, watching plays from\na computer screen does not emulate\nthe actual theatregoing experience in a\nmeaningful way, but given that it\u2019ll be a\nwhile before everything is back to nor-mal, I\u2019ll take it.\nCOVID-19: The Rise and The Fall of\nRemote Theatregoing Credits: Dan Gaken @Flickr\nWho would have thought that it would only take a pandemic for Phantom of the Opera to finally close?\nWATCHING PLAYS\nFROM A COMPUTER\nSCREEN DOES\nNOT EMULATE\nTHE ACTUAL\nTHEATREGOING\nEXPERIENCE IN\nANY MEANINGFUL\nWAY\n\u201c\nOzbil Ege Dumenci Arts Editor\n\n"

Furloughs, lockdowns, first and second waves, vaccine\ntrials, herd immunity and more recently herd mentality - these\nterms have now become far too common.\nThe Creative industry is just like any other, where a few well-known faces shimmer in the limelight, constantly held up by the many. And when\nthe lockdown arrived in earnest in March, the many had nowhere to go. Theatres,\nmusic venues, galleries \u2014 for the most part it was the same story. Shuttered and\nthe thousands whose jobs revolved around these events suddenly were without a\nsafety net. But even within the sector, the pandemic has affected people in vastly\ndifferent ways. While museums and exhibitions have since reopened (albeit with\nsocial distancing measures and a reduced capacity), a vast majority of theatres, live\nevents and music festivals are still shuttered, leaving the thousands who rely on\nthese events for their livelihood with an uncertain future. To get a better grasp of\nthe consequences the pandemic on the industry, we spoke to an insider, Imperials\u2019\nvery own George Ainscough, director of HW Ents; a lighting design, production\nand engineering company based out of Lancashire.\nImetGeorgeatacafeinFulhamBroadwayinmid-September.Thingshavecome\na long way since March, when a complete lockdown was institutionalised leading\nto the entire industry closing. Following the lockdown, weeks of campaigning led\nthe government to announce a \u00a31.57 billion aid package for cultural and heritage\ninstitutions. To be honest, this had me quite upbeat and optimistic, even though\nas recently as last week, the Office of National Statistics estimated that up to 51%\nof the industry workforce is still furloughed (It is to be noted that this doesn\u2019t not\naccount for freelancers, sole traders and limited company directors. In any case,\nthe aid package has been a huge focal point of public discourse over the past few\nmonths and so we began our interview there. Has it been a relief?\nGeorge quickly clarifies \u201cThere is \u00a31.57b in aid, but that figure is split with the\nheritage sector, and the majority of the funding is directed at the large theatres\nwho are already subsidised through Arts Council England prior to the pandemic.\nThere is little to no support for live music or the supply chain.\u201d\nI suspected this. After all, any government scheme is going to have a few cracks\nand any distribution scheme is bound to throw up a debate. But this inability to\naccess funds is a concern shared by many. The \u2018uneven\u2019 distribution of these funds\nacross the different sectors (museums, heritage centres, crown jewels, theatres\netc\u2026) ultimately means very little is available and accessible to people like George.\nEven big names in the field aren\u2019t immune to this. The Royal Albert Hall, which\noperates as a charity, a crown jewel and recently socially \u2018accredited\u2019 bastion of\nBritish nationalism (Rule Britannia!), was unable to access the emergency grants\navailable under the \u00a31.57 government aid package. Instead, the charity has currently been advised to \u2018apply for a government loan\u2019 which, if successful, would\nmake funds available \u2018nine months after its ability to generate income was abruptly\ncut off \u2018.\nThe situation can only be worse for grass roots artists and musicians. \u201cThe\n\u00a31.57b package, while welcome \u2014 has made little to no difference for most individuals and companies in the supply chain\u201d says George. \u201cThere is money, but we\nhardly see any of it, at least not now while we need it\u201d.\nBut there is a sliver of hope in the horizon, with isolated music events, theatres,\nand even festivals, such as the Gisborne park festival, opening with socially distanced arrangements across UK. I bought this up. \u201cIt was reassuring to see some\nfestivals still go ahead with social distancing, like the shows in Virgin Money Unity Arena in Newcastle, but the reality is that vast majority of festivals and shows\nrely on a huge number of people turning up and are not financially viable in the\ncurrent scenario\u201d he chimes in. [However, between the interview and this issues\u2019\npublication the VMUA festival has been cancelled due to the localised lockdown\nin northern England.]\nThere has got to be something to spring the sector back to life, particularly with\nall the ideas being floated around by think tanks and opposition MPs. I quizzed\nGeorge on some of the more popular schemes out there such as \u201cCulture VouchBy Vaidhiswaran Ramesh\nMusic events are a rarety in the age of COVID-19\nCredits: George Ainscough\n\n"

    "content": "ProProspective students often ask\nus whether it\u2019s possible for them to\nstudy medicine and to row at Imperial. The answer is of course, yes- but\na brief look at the boat club history\nreveals much more than that. It\u2019s quite\nastonishing to see the huge contributions our alumni are making in their\nroles, not only within the NHS now,\nbut have also made to the boat club\nover the years. Three members of\nICBC-Toby Heaton, Emily Boother\nand Luke Whiting- were part of the\ncohort of final year Imperial medical students who sat online exams to\ngraduate early and join the NHS staff\non the frontline. Toby was an active\ncommittee member for many years,\nincluding as men\u2019s captain in 2017/8,\nand dedicated a great deal of time to\norganising last year\u2019s very successful\nCentenary Dinner.\nThey follow in the footsteps of last\nyear\u2019s graduates Maddy Ardissino, Harry Knights and Rachel Whiting. Maddy learnt to row with us as a novice and\nwent on to represent Italy at the U23\nWorld Championships in 2016. She\nsaid of her time at Imperial:\n\u201cMy time at ICBC has, hands down,\nbeen the highlight of my time at univer-sity.Ihavemetpeoplethathavebeenmy\nbest friends since. I loved the wins, took\nthe losses to make them into something\nbetter, and everything I learned during\nmy time at ICBC definitely makes me a\nbetter doctor.\u201d\nJade Hubbard, Ollie Dent and Nina\nDalton are now in their FY2 as junior\ndoctors, while former team mate Tim\nRichards is working as an intensive care\nclinical fellow in Bristol having graduated a year prior in 2017.\nTim was part of the Imperial crew\nwhich won the Prince Albert Challenge\nCup in 2013. All but one of this crew\nwere medical students. Coxswain, Ellie\nSmith, studied medicine as a graduate\nstudent:\n\u201cRowing was a huge part of my life at\nmedical school,\u201d said Ellie. \u201cIt provided\nan amazing group of friends and unparalleled experiences.

    "content": "FRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nBOOKS\n39\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThree reasons why readers are dying out\nThink Piece\nLet\u2019s be honest, spotting someone reading in pub-lic; be it on campus, the bus or the train is a rare,\nalmost extraordinary sight. When coming across such\na phenomenon one most certainly feels at awe; some-whatlikethefeelingsharedwhenseeingawildanimal.\nWhat type of animal? A peacock: rare and ravishing.\nSo, what does this mean? Firstly, you will realise\nthat you may lack the title of being \u2018rare and ravishing\u2019, but most importantly readers are most definitely\ndying out! In order to prevent this calamity, we have\ncompiled three reasons as to why students don\u2019t read\nas often; accompanied by tested solutions to help you\ngain the spanking new title of \u2018rare and ravishing!\u2019\nIn all seriousness, the number of people seen reading on campus is dismal, and there is good reason for\nit. Three popular reasons we often hear are : that some\nstudents don\u2019t see the benefits, they don\u2019t have time,\nand finally that they don\u2019t have time.\nWhy \u2013 what\u2019s the point of reading?\nApart from those of you who want to read but are\nsimply too lazy to (no judgement, I get into reading\nslumps too), some simply do not see the point in\nreading. It was required in school, we read all the classics and wrote essays on it \u2013\nthat\u2019s it.\nFair enough.\nSpeakingfromexperience,\nreading works wonders for\none\u2019semotionalhealth.Trust\nme, Imperial has a 4-6 weeks\nwaitlist for mental health\nsupport \u2013 it\u2019s something you\nprobably did not know you\nwould need until you arrive\nhere. Reading allows you to\nsee through someone else\u2019s\nlens \u2013 that usually helps puts things in perspective,\nnottomentionthesimpleactofreadingismeditative.\nLiterature is truly one of the most beautiful forms\nof art out there. To be able to tell a story through\nstrings of words, to learn about the essence of one\u2019s\nlife in a book, to experience and imagine a world out\nof someone\u2019s mind, it\u2019s honestly remarkable. That\nalone is a good enough reason to read.\nIssue of it being time consuming\nBut let\u2019s be honest \u2013 reading is hard, harder than\nwatching a Netflix show or swiping through social\nmedia. It requires thinking, concentration and most\nimportantly \u2013 patience. There is a common perception to associate reading with \u201clearning\u201d and \u201cgaining\nnew information,\u201d i.e. if astronomy interests you, you\nmay pick up something by Neil deGrasse Tyson; if\nyou want an overview of the history\nof civilizations as we know it, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari may\nbe your choice. More and more\nthe action of \u201creading\u201d has been\nconditioned to feel like a heavy\ntask with lots of resistance. Especially in the context of university\nwhere we are constantly being\nbombarded with a truckload of\ninformation, it leaves very little\nspace for our curiosity and thirst\nto learn. It is thus rather ironic\nthat University, an institution\nthat strives to impart knowledge also takes away the\nappeal of learning.\nAs a result, people often cling onto the illusion\nthat \u2018they don\u2019t have time.\u2019 People do have the time;\nhowever, they choose not to spend this time on something that does not yield instant gratification. And\nthis is what we feel\nis the biggest reason why individuals\nrather spend their\nspare time on their\nphone than with a\nbook. Delayed gratification \u2013 the root\nof the reason why\nfellow readers are\ndying out. A phenomenon which\nfurther branches out\nto several other reasons: reading is difficult, I\u2019d rather\nwatch a movie, I don\u2019t see the point of reading. People\noften, as a result, envision reading as a large, daunting\ntask; paired with the delayed gratification associated\nwith reading, it makes tools like Instagram evermore\nenticing. So, what\u2019s the solution?\nFour tips to get started\nFirst, try reducing your consumption of facile and\nHari Kumarakuruparan Books Editor\nJia Qi Tan Books Editors\n3reasons\nIn a nutshell\nWE don\u2019t see the point when we\nare studying so much already\nWE HAVE NO TIME when\nthere\u2019s Instagram and Twitter\nBASICALLY we need instant\ngratification for everything\nPEOPLE OFTEN ENVISION\nREADING AS A LARGE,\nDAUNTING TASK,\nPAIRED WITH DELAYED\nGRATIFICATION\n\u201c\nguaranteed sources of dopamine, for example social\nmedia.\nSecondly, take a moment and think, was there\nsomething that has always intrigued you that you\u2019ve\nalways wanted to learn more about? Is there a book\nthatyou\u2019vealwayswantedtoread,butyousimplenever did? Pick it up and maybe give it a go.\nThirdly, start small. Very small. Small goals, which,\nthrough incremental improvements will result in\nlarger results in the long run. The\ntwo-minute rule is a well-known\ntechnique, in which you spend\njust two minutes on the task at\nhand. This instantly eliminates\nthe daunting obstacle of reading a\nbig book with many, many pages\nand words. Most often than not\nyou\u2019ll exceed the two-minutes,\nwhich is exactly the point \u2013 you\u2019re\ntricking the brain.\nFourthly, being consistent. Actively trying to find opportunities\ntoread.Agoodmethodis,instead\nof using your phone whilst commuting, bring out a\nbook and start turning those pages. However, reading\non the train should then not become a discouraging\ntask. Reading on the train should rather, become the\nobjective of reading one page on the train. I\u2019ll examine and explore this idea of developing a habit under\na larger, more impressive magnifying glass, in an upcoming review on the book Atomic Habits.\nConclusion\nThe point of this article is not to convert the entire Imperial campus into adamant booklovers all of a\nsudden \u2013 this is to hopefully serve as a gentle reminder of how much all of us loved reading \u2013 remember\nwhen we devoured Harry Potter or The Twilight\nSaga. It would be a little sad if we give up reading, to\nquote Lemmy Kilmister, \u201cPeople don\u2019t read any more.\nIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs. Reading\u2019s the only thing that\nallows you to use your imagination. When you watch\nfilms it\u2019s someone else\u2019s vision, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\n9\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCOMMENT\nTo the Department of Mechanical\nEngineering, Imperial College\nLondon is not doing enough to support Black, minority ethnic and other\nunder-represented students and staff.\nWhere actions have been taken, the\nuniversity has failed to effectively engage with systemic and structural problems of racism and discrimination. Imperial removing its Latin motto due to\nits ties to colonialism is, fundamentally,\nan empty gesture, one that is especially\ntokenistic considering the university\u2019s\nimperial-istic name. The College fails\nto take true accountability of its ties to\ncolonialism and the legacy of the British empire. Instead of making superficial changes, we call on the university\nto champion effective anti-racism initiatives and support the wellbeing of its\nBlack, ethnic minority and other un-der-represented students and staff.\nAsMechanicalEngineeringstudents,\nwe recognise the positive steps our department has taken toward fostering\nan open and supportive environment\nfor all. It is a place where the wellbeing\nof students is valued, as exemplified by\nthe encouraging work of our dedicated\nSenior Management Team. However, it is also a place where there are no\nBlack staff and only a handful of Black\nand ethnic minority PhD students, and\nwhere conversations about race and\ngender inequality are limited to the\nminorities affected. The onus to establish action and accountability within\nthe department has been placed solely\non staff and students of the associated\nminorities. We believe that the onus\nshould be shared by the majority white,\nmale, and /or middle-class department\npopulace.\nIt is for these reasons that we, the students of the Mechanical Engineering\ndepartment, implore the department\nto act on the following fronts where\nanti-racism and pastoral supports for\nBlack, ethnic minority and other un-der-represented communities are still\nlacking. We hope that such action\nwill also catalyse change on a universi-ty-wide level, to begin tackling Imperial\u2019s deep-rooted links to racism and\ndiscrimination.\nWe, the students of the Mechanical\nEngineering department, understand\nthat the department is already engaged\nin outreach aiming to \u201cwiden participation and access for Black, Asian & Minority Ethnics students\u201d to the College\n(Strategic Planning Division, 2019).\nWhile this intervention is a welcome\ndevelopment that will undoubtedly\nhave some positive effect, increasing the\nnumber of under-represented students\nwithout addressing the systemic racism\nprevalent in the university only increases the number of under-represented\nstudents dealing with the psychological\nstress of discrimination.\nAn Equality and Human Rights\nCommittee (EHRC) inquiry into racism in higher education reported that\nthose who make formal complaints of\nracial harassment often deal with a profound impact on their mental health.\nOut of 559 recorded complaints of racial harassment, 8% of complainants re-portedfeelingsuicidal.1in20students,\nwho responded to the EHRC\u2019s call for\ninstances of racial harassment, left their\ncourse, and 3 in 20 members of staff left\ntheir jobs (EHRC, 2019). We demand\nthe department to:\n1. Facilitate a departmental mental\nhealth support system equipped with\ncounselling and support for Black, minority ethnic and other under-repre-sented students who are experiencing\nracial trauma and discrimination.\na. Employ additional student wellbeing advisors equipped with the cultural competencies and specialties for\nBlack students and other under-repre-sented groups.\nb. Engage in data collection & investigation to ensure there is not a mental health service access gap.\nc. Produce yearly reports recording\nparticipation and engagement to the\nsaid mental health support services.\nWe, the students of the Mechanical\nEngineering department, understand\nthat it is the responsibility of the teaching staff, personal tutors, and administrators of the department to support\nthe academic and pastoral demands of\nBlack and minority ethnic students.\nIn order to fulfil such a role, effective\ntraining is essential. Yet, the current\nUnconscious Bias and Active Bystander\ntraining is inadequate and generic. Staff\nare ill-equipped to address fundamental\nmatters of racial inequality, institutional racisms, white privilege, and racial\nmicroaggressions in education \u2013 issues\nthat Black and minority ethnic students\nface on a daily basis. Thus, it is imperative that the department:\n2. Reform the current inadequate\nAnti-Bias work at both a staff and stu-Mechanical Engineering Students present this letter to their Department, with calls of reforms to BAME support, anti-racism\ntraining and procedures dealing with racial issues.\nOpen Letter on anti-racism to the\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\nMech.Eng.students\nPhoto credits: Imperial Colllege Assset Library\n\u201c\nI experienced so much racism in\nhalls. The people I was literally\nsurrounded with were overwhelmingly white and privileged, so I\nconstantly felt othered. On one\noccasion, I made curry and ate it\nwith my hands, this prompted a\nwhite friend to tell me that was un-hygienic and disgusting. When I\ntold him, it was completely normal\nin other parts of the world, other\npeople told me to let it go and to\ncuthimsomeslack.Iwasrepeated-ly called the \u2018token brown friend\u2019,\nwith some saving my number as\nthat in their phones. My white\nfriends would complain that there\nwere too many ethnic societies\nat Imperial and that third world\ncountries should be grateful for\ncolonisation. They would say the\nN-word freely and without conse-quence. I felt like I had to assimilate so much just to avoid ridicule\nand embarrassment. I changed\nmy accent, the food I ate, and the\nthings I enjoyed just to please\npeople that were meant to be my\nfriends.\n\u201d\nQueen Victoria\u2019s Statue in the College Main Entrance\nQueen Victoria\u2019s Statue in the College Main Entrance\nSTUDENT TESTIMONY\n\n"

We are looking to stage this\nthis year, if that is possible!\nWith the government guidelines\ncontinuously changing, you guys are\nprobably having to come up with new\ncontingency plans. What have been\nsome of the biggest challenges in this\nprocess?\nDramSoc: I think it\u2019s been really\nhard this year to try and come up with\ncontingency plans, guidance is constantly changing for us. We\u2019ve effectively had to cancel all in-person shows for\nthe time being, but we\u2019ve been working\nhard on finding alternatives, and we\u2019re\nexcited for when we\u2019re allowed back on\n(and behind) the stage!\nMTSoc: Each production requires\nmonths of planning to go ahead, from\nthe proposal process, to rehearsals, to\nshow week. Due to the changing guidelines and uncertainty surrounding first\nterm events, we\nhave faced delays\nwhich has put\nus significantly\nbehind our usual\ntimeline. The\nlack of specific support for\nperforming arts\nsocieties and\nthe severe delay\nin information\nmakes planning\nour normal\nevents and contingency events difficult\nat best. While this has been challeng-ing, the enthusiasm and dedication I\u2019ve\nseen from my committee and our society members makes the process worth\nit, and there\u2019s definitely been a stronger\nsense of community between the performing arts societies! I can\u2019t wait to\nsee what we all achieve this year!\nICSM Drama: We\u2019re all motivated\nto find a way to perform and produce\ntheatre in line with government and\ncollege guidelines, so our main obstacle\nCredits: Dingyu Lu\nwill be adapting to last minute changes\nin this difficult and unpredictable time.\nHowever, we want to make this an enjoyable and exciting year for everyone\nin the society.\nICSM Light Opera: The biggest\nproblems we have encountered centre\naround how we can carry out our Main\nOpera show, and our socials during the\nrehearsal term, whilst still adhering to\ngovernment guidance. This has been\nparticularly difficult as the guidance\nhas been constantly evolving and\nthings we thought were possible initially are no longer possible. We\u2019ve also\nfound problems with how to share our\nBig Chill events, although (hopefully)\nwe can continue with all these events\nthroughout the year!\nAnd what can you share about the\ncurrent plans for this year?\nDramSoc: We\u2019ve had to find other\nways to perform. Therefore, we\u2019ve been\nplanning a radio show to perform this\nterm, which we\u2019re all quite excited\nabout! DramSoc has planned more\nworkshops to be virtual too, including\nones for script development, acting and\ntechies. We have a whole host of lighting and sound desks at our disposal, so\nwe\u2019ll be running lots of workshops on\nhow to use them, as well as planning\nlots of light shows\non visualisation\nsoftware too!\nMTSoc: The\ncommittee does\npromise to offer performance\nopportunities\nevery term. Over\nSummer term in\nlockdown, we held\nweekly Wednesday zoom calls;\nan MTSoc online\nquiz, filmed a Lockdown Choir video\ntitled \u2018I See Stars\u2019; and held an online\ncabaret with our End of Year Awards\nceremony. We are planning to host\nanother online cabaret this term as\nwell as other online socials like movie\nnights and quizzes. Last year, we debuted MTSoc Families; we hope that this\nyear, these families can provide some\nin-person social activities to welcome\nnewcomers face-to-face.

However, you won\u2019t\ncome across typical patterns leopard, cow, zebra print\nbut rather see a blazer embellished in frog skin pat-tern, a tube top made of ladybug resembling beads, a\ndress with small black dots on it which are not polka\ndots but ants.\nVALENTINO\nSince Pierpaolo Piccioli became creative director of\nValentino, sales of waterproof mascara have *not*\ncoincidentally increased the\nday before each of his shows.\nPeople actually leave in tears\n- just like Imperial students\nleaving their exam halls. But\nbetter dressed. And in Paris.\nThis year Piccioli stayed\ntrue to maison Valentinos\nidentity by bringing a literal\nexplosion of colour to the\nrunway in voluminous\ngowns. Colour blocking,\nmassive bows and heavy\nbeautiful embellishments all made a strong showing.\nPiccioli made a bold move by introducing eccentric,\nextremely long earrings \u2013 longer even than my last relationship to haute couture. A questionable accessory\nfor couture but we\u2019ll take it. Aduta Kech emotionally\nclosed this show wearing a jaw dropping baby pink\nfeather gown and yes people left in tears. Google it if\nyou don\u2019t believe me.\nJean Paul Gaultier one of the biggest names in fash-ion, an icon, a master, a legend; announced that this\nyear\u2019s couture show would be his last one. It was an\nhour long and very appropriately\ntook place in a theatre. I could\nwrite a full essay on this but will\nleave it at this: If Coco Rocha\ndressed in madras print, plaid and\nfeather, dancing a ballet inpsired\nScottish folk hybrid dance to\nMissy Elliot music in the back-ground, doesn\u2019t capture Gaultier\u2019s\naesthetic... I don\u2019t know what else\ncould. Big models such as Karlie Kloss, Irina Shayk,\nthe Hadids and the corset queen herself: Dita Von\nF* Tease were some of the legends parading Gaultiers\nlatest and last couture creations.\nGIVENCHY\nGivenchy, another well-known\nfashion house also produces a\ncouture line once a year. Kaia\nGerber (Cindy Crawford\u2019s\ndaughter for the non-Instagram\njunkies out there) closed the\nshow with a dramatic bridal\nlooking gown and a hat that\nto my childish eyes looked like\npapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\nBALMAIN\nNot all fashion houses create couture collections. A\nnotable absence was Olivier Rousteing, the creative\ndirector of Balmain. New last year, he was heavily\ncriticised which might go some way to explaining his\ndecision to stay away this year. Giambatista Valli did\nnot take part in a catwalk this year as well but chose\ninstead to present his couture line in a proper art\nexhibition space as fine art. Valli has been known for\nhis voluminous toulle dresses the past few years ever\nsince the goddess herself: Rihanna, wore a humongous pink one to the 2015 Grammys. This year Valli\ntook the puffy toulle gowns to another length *lit-erally*. I swear these dresses\nwouldn\u2019t fit in my London\napartment.\nCHANEL\nChanel\u2019s new post-Lagerfeld\ncreative director, Virginie\nViard, paid homage to Coco\nChanel\u2019s childhood spent\naround nuns, presenting a collection that used both nun like colours and shapes.\nThough still haute couture I couldn\u2019t help feel a bit\nunderwhelmed.\nJACQUEMUS\nAlthough not a couture line, Jacquemus showcased\nhis \u201cL\u2019anee 97\u201d line which paid tribute to his late\nmother, 1997 being the first time he made a dress for\nhis mother. Jacquemus rose dramatically in popularity when he took over the fashion world with his tiny\n(tiny). bags which are as functional as a necklace yet\nstill sold out globally. But that is fashion!\nOn that note, stay tuned for our next fashion week\ncover whenever that will be in these weird COVID\ntimes.\nAu revoir mes amours!\nThe Last Fashion Week before\nCOVID\nLouise-Cristine Pitsillides Fashion Writer\nECCENTRIC,\nEXTREMELY LONG\nEARRINGS \u2013 LONGER\nEVEN THAN MY LAST\nRELATIONSHIP TO\nHAUTE COUTURE\n\u201c\nHaute Couture week Paris January 2020\nAS FUNCTIONAL\nAS A NECKLACE\nYET STILL SOLD\nOUT GLOBALLY\n\u201c\nSCHIAPARELLI\nJEAN PAUL GAULTIER\n\n"

Titian was given artistic\nlicense to freely choose and interpret the subject mat-ter, and thus in a unique way these paintings are the\nphysical manifestation of the old masters\u2019 true ambition and creativity, unencumbered. Titian chose to\nsource from Ovid\u2019s \u2018Metamorphoses\u2019 (quite literally\n- Book of transformations), a cornerstone of classical\nliterature, hugely popular then among artists, encompassing around 250 Greek & Roman myths. He envisaged it as a series of 7 paintings, only 6 of which he\nwas able to send to Philip before Titian\u2019s death. The\nseventh, \u2018Death of Actaeon\u2019 was never sent to Philip\nbut is finally reunited with the rest of the series in this\nexhibition.\nPaintedoverthespanofadecade(\u2018DeathofActeon\u2019,\nthere is debate over whether the seventh painting was\never finished), each of these seven paintings are grand,\nboth in vision and in scale, and Titian has leveraged\nhis freedom of subject matter to explore the depths of\nRoman-Greek mythology, producing some of the finest thematic exposition of \u2018seduction, power and disguise\u2019 in paintings. One of the most defining features\nof these paintings, one that is often stressed upon, is\nthe that the feminine characters in these poesies are in\na state of undress. Contemporary interpretations are\ndivided over Titian\u2019s motive \u2013 a popular modern view\nis that Titian was prodding Philip II\u2019s piety with the\nchoice of models and his handling of nudity. One can\nnever truly know what the artists\u2019 intent was, but it is\nhard to refute the fact that the nudity or the feminine\nin this instance is not purely allegorical. The nudity of\nthe feminine is not treated as a parable to subjugation\nor feebleness, as it often is, but rather is given a sincere\ntreatment and is used to add intensity to the characters and their plight. A beautiful exposition of these\nthreads is seen in the three paintings featuring Diana,\nand most particularly \u2018Diana and Castillo\u2019, pictured\nabove, which shows Diana\u2019s wrath when she realises\none of her companions (vowed to celibacy) is preg-nant.\nIt is difficult not to draw parallels between Titians\u2019 work and Bernini\u2019s masterpiece \u2014 \u2018The Rape of\nProserpina\u2019 despite the two artists completely different mediums of choice. Interestingly, however, they\nare both inspired by Ovid\u2019s work. The strokes in the\nformer are almost surreal, fragile and emotive\u2026 in the\nsame way as Bernini\u2019s treatment is in the latter. The\ntenderness and the evocativeness of flesh come about\ninequalshadesinthesestrokes.Thefainthazinessand\ntexture of the paintings only elevate these features, almost as if we are there, only removed from the action,\nmere mortals witnessing mythology.\nArguably the highlights of the exhibition (if one\ncan humbly say so about the old masters\u2019 work) are\nthe paintings \u2018Diana and Actaeon\u2019 and \u2018Diana and\nCallisto\u2019 which were envisioned as a pair and are now\ncollectively owned by the National Gallery in London\nand the National Gallery of Scotland.\nThe exhibition is special in this context that for the\nfirst time, we see the collection together, united after\nover four centuries, something that neither Titian\nnor Philip II was able to do. This was made possible\nbecause of the landmark decision by the committee\nof the Wallace collection in 2019 to loan exhibits for\nthe first time in its 119-year-old history, breaking its\nterms of endowment.\nAnd this produces something truly unique, allow-ingustoappreciatetheartiststransitionovertheyears,\nhis own \u2018metamorphosis\u2019 of sorts, beginning with the\nlighter work in \u2018Danae\u2019 and \u2018Venus and Adonis\u2019 and\nthe earthier \u2018Death of Actaeon\u2019 produced in his final\nyears.\nNo work better exemplifies the Venetian school or\nindeed the late Renaissance than Titian\u2019s ambitious\nworkhere.Theexhibitionwhichwassupposedtocon-clude by 16th of June 2020, has been extended until\n17th of January 2021 courtesy of the pandemic. After\nLondon, the poesies and the exhibition, are soon to\nembark on a grand tour, making stops in Edinburgh,\nMadrid and Boston.

First awarded in\n2012, it aims to \u201chonour the most profound and transformative discoveries\u201d\nand counts Stephen Hawking amongst\nits laureates.\nSir Martin Hairer has previously\nbeen awarded the prestigious Fields\nMedal and joined the maths department at Imperial in 2017.\nFelix sat down with Sir Martin Hairer (over Microsoft Teams, of course) to\ndiscuss his research and what it\u2019s like to\nwin a $3m prize.\nFelix: Firstly, congratulations on\nwinning the Breakthrough Prize!\nHow did you feel when you heard you\nhad won?\nMH: Surprised! I was first told by\nthe head of the selection committee,\nTerence Tao. I didn\u2019t expect that at all\n- he sent me an email asking if we could\nhave a chat on Skype, and we were both\ninvolved in the organisation of the next\nCongress of Mathematics, so I just\nthought it was something about that.\nBut obviously I was extremely happy\nand honoured that they selected my\nwork for that prize.\nFelix: Has there been a ceremony?\nMH: Not yet - the ceremony was\nmeant to be in November, but because\nof the whole COVID situation that\u2019s\nnotworkingout.Soit\u2019sbeenpostponed\nto the end of March. We\u2019ll see how that\nturns out.\nFelix: You\u2019ve been recognised for\nyour work in stochastic partial differential equations. How would you describe this field?\nMH: So first I should start by explaining what a differential equation is.\nThese equations are used to describe,\nfor example, the movement of celestial\nbodies. In that case, you have a physical\nlaw that tells you how their position,\nwhich is a function, changes instantaneously with time. Now, partial differential equations are a similar type\nof equation, but where you could have\na function dependent on two or more\nvariables \u2013 so before we had time, and\nnow space can join the game as well.\nThese can describe the motion of a\nfluid, and the function would be the\nvelocity of the fluid at every point dependent on density, maybe temperature and other parameters as well. So it\nwould vary not just in time, but also in\nspace, and the partial differential equations that describe this system will also\ninvolve both time and space.\nStochastic partial differential equations consider the randomness of the\nsystem. There\u2019s some random influence that acts on\nyour system,\nand there would\nbe an additional term in the\nequation to describe that. So\nfor our fluid ex-ample, randomness could be\nthermal fluctu-ations, or wind\nblowing on the surface of the water.\nOne example I\u2019ve used several times is\nstirring a cup of tea \u2013 the motion of the\nspoon might be modelled by a random\nterm. These are the type of equations I\nam interested in.\nMore specifically, the chunk of work\nI got the prize for was for analysing a\nclass of such equations where the solutions are extremely irregular, and the\nrandomness acts in such a way that the\nsolutions vary rapidly in space. They\nbecome so irregular that when you\nwrite down an\nequation, it\u2019s not\neven clear how to\ninterpret the equation from a mathematical point of\nview.\nFelix: So these solutions are not\neven analytical then?\nMH: No, not at all, in some cases\nThe Imperial mathematician who won\nthe $3m Breakthrough Prize\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nProfessor Sir Martin Hairer, Fields Medallist and winner of the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics\nPhoto credits: Imperial College London\nIT\u2019S ABOUT TRYING\nTO UNDERSTAND\nTHE PHENOMENON\nOF UNIVERSALITY.\n\u201c\n\n"

The staff have\nworked to ensure the facilities can be\nopened safely and to also still ensure the\nbest student experience. For this, some\nnew measures have come into play.\nFirstly, all memberships must be\ndone prior to entering the facilities.\nGym membership is \u00a330 a year and\nmembership for sports hall and pool is\nfree!\nBookings are mandatory for\neverything at Ethos: gym sessions,\nclasses, access to the pool, anything you\ncan think of. This is in line with a fair\nusage policy: 2 bookings a day with a\nmaximum of 7 bookings over the course\nof 6 days, and you can only book events\n6 days in advance. All activities will be\ndone in blocks of 45 min so that there\nis a 15min period of deep cleaning that\nthe staff can do before the next block.\nThey have also reduced capacity to\n35%. Sadly, the sauna, steam room, and\nrock-climbing wall will be closed due\nto social distancing. The gym has also\nlimited equipment and boxed off areas\nto ensure 2 meters of social distancing.\nFinally, some of the smaller rules and\nregulationsputintoplace:therewon\u2019tbe\naccess to dry changing rooms, showers,\nand lockers, there are designated oneway areas, and hanging out outside in\nlarge groups is not allowed.\nMove Imperial has also expanded\nits platform to adjust for people who\nwon\u2019t be able to go to a gym.

To the dismay of\nparents helping their children move in it is almost\npossible to forget you are living in a box surrounded\nby other people.\nThis behaviour stems from restrictive COVID\nrules limiting student freedom so much that talking\nthrough the walls is the only form of socialisation\navailable.\nFeb Senton, a new Beit resident explained that unable to go on a night out he had been really looking\nforward to being assigned a room next to \u201cthe bastard\nthat wants to play techno at 3 am.\u201d\nWhat would once feel like a death sentence is now\nhot real estate as Facebook Welcome groups light up\nwith requests to move closer to alleged noise makers\nand freshers advertise their huge subwoofers on dating apps.\nThe trend towards thinner walls has got so fierce\nthat freshers are being searched on arrival and cofiles,\npickaxes and drills are being confiscated in their hun-dreds.\nThe strict rules have also assisted those in the dating\ngame.\nOne Wilson resident, Woliver Eir, said \u201cI am not\nexactly a looker and I was quite excited about the\nwhole idea. After 6 weeks of getting to know each\nother in Morse code by tapping on the radiator pipes,\nthe friends I make will definitely over look my lethal\nhalitosis when we finally met.\u201d\nUnfortunately, this method of socialising can\u2019t substitute completely for face to face interaction. NegaFelix has reports that attempts by first years to lose\ntheir virginity through the walls lead to confusion\nand frustration when the hole through the wall was\ncompleted and it was found that both parties had lied\nabout their gender.\nChannel 4 announced a new spin-off to the popular game show Come Dine with Me, where\nImperial students from various halls compete for a 15\nminute counselling session.\nHosted by Mr Blobby, the programme pits freshers\nfrom Beit, Princes Gardens, Xenia, and North Acton\ninacompetitionagainsteachothertoprovidethebest\nevening of food and entertainment. Felix received early access to first episode, which airs on Monday 5th\nOctober.\nThe first round saw Beit resident Feb Senton host-ing. His menu was inspired by his EIE module Simulation and Modelling. His messy, spicy fajitas were\nservedonabedofDoritoes,experiencedonlythrough\nhis guests\u2019 VR goggles. Susanne Clifford from Xenia\ncommented, \u201cthey tasted lovely but they were a little\nlight.\u201d\nFor entertainment, Senton had everyone lie in bed\nand try to sleep while the Metric speakers blared the\ntop tracks of Now That\u2019s What I Call Music 23.\nThe second round in Princes Gardens was hosted\nby Marco Fusilli. His three course menu consisted\nof: a boiled pasta starter lightly drizzled in Dolmio\u2019s Bolognese Original\nPasta Sauce 500g from Tesco (like his\nmother made in Sicily; a fajita pasta\nbake with sliced Sainsbury\u2019s Garlic\nBaguette x2 420g \u00a31.65g/unit; finishing off with a Cadbury Dairy Milk\nButtons Chocolate Dessert 85g each.\nThe third evening was spent at Susanne Clifford\u2019s kitchen at Xenia. Unfortunately the experience was quite\nforgettable, like everything else about\nXenia. But there were definitely fajitas\ninvolved.\nThe final night was hosted by Doug Campbell. In a\ngesture sure to help his final score, he provided donkeys and guides to help his guests make the trek. He\nplanned to serve up spaghetti hoops, baked beans,\ntinned mash potatoes, and tinned peas, but unfortunately had forgotten to buy a can opener. Undaunted,\nhe started the entertainment early, encouraging guests\nto join him in a noisy rendition of I\u2019m Gonna Be (500\nMiles).\nAfter the sing-along, the results were announced.\nWith a 15 minute counselling session on the cards,\ntensions were high. In last place, Susanne Clifford\nfrom Xenia, for obvious reasons. In third, Doug.\nThough he kept spirits high, his lack of can opener\nproved to be a fatal error. In joint second place, the\nwinners Senton and Fusilli were given half of the 15\nminute slot each.\nDelighted, Senton told Negafelix, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to\nettend my session, I\u2019ve already got the first available\nslot. 2026 is gonna be my year!\u201d Fusilli was similarly\npleased, \u201cI just sold my slot to a JMC student for 50\nquid and a sexy back rub.\u201d\nStudent Representatives Calls for Thinner Walls\nChannel 4 announces \u201cCome Dine with MeStudent Halls Edition\u201d\nCredits: wikimedia\nCredits: Thomas Angus\nTarlie Hitmuss NegaFelix Reporter\nTarlie Hitmuss NegaFelix Reporter\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFelix@ic.ac.uk\n12\nHANGMAN\n\n"

    "content": "they\u2019re not even continuous. They\u2019re\nextremely irregular.\nFelix: Do you make use of a lot of\ncomputation in your work then?\nMH: I do use simulations to guide\nintuitions, sometimes. If you want to\nfigure out what some system does you\ncode it up and see what it actually does\non a computer, and that might give\nyou hints of what you might be able to\nprove mathematically. But I wouldn\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s a major component of my work.\nAnd of course, I use simulations to help\nillustrate my lectures as well.\nFelix: Is it fair to say that your work\nis quite often dealing with emergent\nphenomena?\nMH: Yeah, you could say that. In\nthe physicists\u2019 language, it\u2019s more about\ntrying to understand the phenomenon\nof universality, trying to understand\nwhy there are a lot of different systems\nthat, when you look at the fluctuations\nat very large scales, they actually kind of\nlook the same. Typically at large scales,\na system doesn\u2019t really depend on the\nmicroscopic details. It\u2019s something that\nas a physicist you would take for grant-ed, but as a mathematician it\u2019s not at all\nsomething that\u2019s obvious. So it goes in\nthe direction of trying to understand\nthat phenomenon.\nFelix: When researching you I\nfound out that your father is also a\nmathematician! What\u2019s it like having\ntwo mathematicians in the family?\nMH: Three, actually! My wife is also\na mathematician, she\u2019s even a professor\nat Imperial as well. When we go back\nand visit my parents, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re\nall just talking about math at the dinner\ntable or anything at all, it\u2019s just normal\nfamily conversations. I mean, what my\nfather does in math, isn\u2019t that close to\nwhatI\u2019mdoing.Wecanstillunderstand\neach other and what research the other\nis doing, but we\u2019re not really that close\nresearch wise. With my wife, Professor\nXue-Mei Li, we\u2019re a bit closer because\nshe also works in probability. We actually have published a joint paper to-gether. But yeah, we don\u2019t always talk\nabout math at home.\nFelix: Did he play a part in inspiring you to study the same discipline?\nMH: Certainly, in the sense that he\nwould always be willing to answer my\nquestions and I would ask him what he\nwas working on. I was always interested in sciences, and I actually started by\nstudying physics, I was in the theoretical physics group in Geneva. But then\nI got more and more attracted towards\nthe mathematical side.\nFelix: You did your PhD in physics\nas well \u2013 how come you switched over\nto maths?\nMH: Yeah, well I did the PhD formally in the physics department, but it\nwas really a PhD in math. At any other\nuniversity my supervisor would have\nbeen in the math department. I felt I\nwas just better at math, and I like the\nfact that in math, when you prove a the-orem, it\u2019s true forever.\nFelix: You\u2019ve been awarded the\nFields Medal, you\u2019ve been knight-ed, and now you have also won this\nBreakthrough Prize. As someone who\nhas been awarded so many honours,\nwhat\u2019s your opinion on these honour\nsystems?\nMH: Maybe slightly ambivalent. I\u2019m\nobviously extremely happy to have been\nawarded, but I get the feeling that there\narecertaintypesofworkthatareeasyto\nhonour because it\u2019s clear that one person has made the main contribution. So\ninthatsense,IgotluckybecauseIdevel-oped a chunk of theory and it was really\nclear to see that the founding paper was\nwritten entirely by\nmyself, and many\nof the later papers were written\nin collaboration\nwith students, or\npostdocs, and so\nit was clear that\nI founded that\ntheory. Whereas\nwhat happens in\nmany cases is you\nhave math that\ngets developed by\nseveral people to-gether. And there\nit\u2019s much less clear\nwho you would\nwant to honour -if there\u2019s five people from different\ninstitutions that\nall contributed to it in various bits and\npieces, then someone who deserves\nto be recognised may miss out. But it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the math they produced is any less impressive. So that\u2019s always the thing that makes me feel a bit\nuneasy about them.\nFelix: This interview is for the\nfresher\u2019s issue of Felix, and presumably many maths freshers will be reading this. Is there anything you would\nlike to say to them?\nMH: This year is especially challeng-ing,becausetheywillhavetofollowlec-tures from home and there will be very\nlittle interaction with staff. I want to\nwish them good luck,\nand I hope that this\nunusual format\nisn\u2019t going to turn\nthem away from\ntheir studies, and\nthey can still find\na way to motivate\nthemselves, even if\nthere is less social\ninteraction, which\nis of course a very\nimportant part of\nuniversity life. So I\ncan certainly sym-pathise with them\nas they\u2019ve drawn\nthe short straw\nhere.\nFelix: Final\nquestion \u2013 which\nmathematician, historic or present,\ndo you believe should be more recog-nised?\nMH: Well, it always depends on: recognised by whom? One of the mathematicians I found most impressive is\nvon Neumann, and he is of course well\nknown among mathematicians and presumably you\u2019ve heard about him too.\nBut everyone knows Einstein, or Newton, but very few in the general public\nknow von Neumann. He certainly deserves to be a household name.\nFRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIF THERE\u2019S FIVE\nPEOPLE FROM\nDIFFERENT\nINSTITUTIONS\nTHAT ALL\nCONTRIBUTED,\nTHEN SOMEONE\nWHO DESERVES TO\nBE RECOGNISED\nMAY MISS OUT.\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n25\nTate Modern was running an exhibition of Andy Warhol before lockdown\nstarted, which was forced to be put on pause. Now it\u2019s up and running\nagain for an extended time, which I guess we have got a certain virus to thank\nfor. So if your online lectures are draining you faster than your lousy London\nsink is draining your dirty dishwater, maybe now is the time to see what the\nfather of pop art was all about.\nBorn Andrew Warhola, he was the son of two Slovakian immigrants who had\nmigrated to an industrial Pittsburgh before Andy was born. During his earlier\nyears as an artist he built up a studio that he called \u201cThe Factory\u201d, where his\nmodel- and artist friends joined him in creating constant art. He dubbed them\nhis \u201cfactory superstars\u201d. In the factory, they would hang out and take photos\nand film each other, together forming some kind of a living artwork. One of\nthe rooms in the exhibition is made to look like this factory, with its iconic\nsilver-coloured walls. Photographs of the factory hang on the walls here, and\nsome of his film reels are playing on the wall, giving us a feeling of being there\nin the factory, hanging out with Andy and the superstars. However, none of it\nfeels quite welcoming. There\u2019s a levitating feeling of alienation in the air, in both\nthe story of Andy\u2019s life and the way that he approached his art. He spoke and\nwrote about feeling alienated and left out during different stages of his life. This\nis something one can imagine not only relates to the obvious factors, like his immigrant background and homosexuality, but also his eccentric approach to life\nand apparent shyness. He also spoke of feeling like a machine when creating his\npop art, and that being a machine was desirable as machines don\u2019t discriminate.\nOh how disappointed Andy would be if he saw the racist and biased algorithms\nwe have today.\nAndy\u2019s life took a dramatic turn in the 60s, when he suddenly was shot by one\nof his own factory superstars. An outright and radical feminist, having released\na manifesto stressing the need of eradicating all men, she stated Andy was stealing her work. Andy was pronounced clinically dead, but somehow the surgeons\nmanaged to save him. He then went on to have two more fruitful decades before\nactually dying (again).\nAndy experimented with many different art media, for example making a lot of\nexperimental films. He would just film a subject doing absolutely nothing for\nthe whole reel. He filmed his then-partner sleeping over many different nights,\nputting together a five hour film with the idea that everyone coming in and\nwatching the film would catch a slightly different moment of him.\nI am enthralled by Andy\u2019s life story. Am I as enthralled by his art? Maybe not,\nbut maybe that is because of the obvious prevalence and impact it has had in our\nsociety already. His pop art was paradigm shifting, but it has been milked dry\nin every art history course I\u2019ve ever sat through. For this reason I\u2019m happy the\nexhibition has been curated with a storytelling narrative in mind. From the very\nmoment you enter, you are given not only a brochure but a QR code to scan,\ntaking you to an audio-guide tailored to each room and period of Andy\u2019s life.\nThis makes the exhibition very interactive and user-friendly. Just remember to\nbring your earphones, and you\u2019re guaranteed a good story!\nCredits: Andrew Dunkley\nReviewed by Amanda Hertzberg Arts Editor\nAndy Warhol @ Tate Modern\n12th\nMarch - 15th\nOctober\n\u00a325 (concession \u00a322 or Tate Collective ticket \u00a37) www.tate.org.uk\nThe Eccentric\nFather of Pop Art\nExhibition\nAndy Warhol\u2019s screen printing motifs\n\n"

A\nselection of \u201calternative\u201d shirts, check. Coffee\nsnobbery, check. Plant-based diet, check. Yup, my\nname is Guthrie and I\u2019m a textbook hipster. Don\u2019t\nworry though, I\u2019m not as textbook when it comes to\nmusic.\nMy taste in music can swing between extremes. At\ntimes I\u2019m engaging in ultimate snobbery of the highest degree, only listening to niche music that to the\naverage listener may sound \u201clike the most annoying\nalarm clock ever\u201d (real quote from my housemate).\nHowever, I\u2019m just as likely to have a week of binging\nnothing but the trashiest tracks from my childhood\n\u2013 JLS, N-dubz, Chipmunk, Tinie Tempah. A comfortable middle ground is what I\u2019m striving for.\nWriting articles is not something I do in an\nattempt to become an accomplished writer or gain\nesteem amongst fellow music heads. Rather, I use it\nas a catharsis for my own curiosities and intrigues\nabout aspects of music. This includes exploring the\ngenre of Japanese environmental music and why JLS\u2019s\n\u2018The Club Is Alive\u2019 is a brilliant song, I have articles\nin the works for both (stay tuned my dudes). Putting\nit simply - I write to entertain myself, hopefully I can\ndo the same for you.\nAsad Raja\nThis will be my third year as Music Editor, which makes this my third \u201cintro to\nme\u201d aka \u201cyeah I\u2019m on my fifth level of Radiohead-before-Radiohead-ception discovery\nand now I have to point out that Kid A is\nblatantly derivative of the most banal trans-Celtic-post-glitch-horror-core albums of\nthe 70s (1870s) but also I like Drake so I\u2019m\nrelatable!\u201d. I feel like the most unembarrass-ing way for me to talk about my relationship\nwith music is to talk about it the same way\nPusha T talks about coke dealing \u2013 so un-abashedly braggadocios about his synonymous status with the subject that the listener\nbecomes the trade union to his labouring of\nthe point. Don\u2019t know if I can pull that off\nthough, I\u2019m just a suburban brown boy studying mechanical engineering. I\u2019m too cynical\nto suspend disbelief, so why ask you to? After\nall, one NAV can distract from every Freddie\nMercury, Talvin Singh, Four Tet, M.I.A, Jai\nPaul, Charli XCX, Jay Sean, Rishi Rich, Steel\nBanglez and Zayn that came before. Not\ntrying to compare myself to any of the latter,\nI\u2019m not a brown creative/music genius. I am a\nbrown creative-music Genius though (you know, like\nthe website, Genius? It was a clever pun, trust me).\nI\u2019m not above the self-aggrandisement of pouring\nout hot cups of opinion by the way \u2013 just wait till\nyou read one of my reviews, or see my website, or ask\nwho my top five is at a Hip Hop Soc social (a society\nfounded last year by, guess who).\nMartin Flerin\nAs I write this, I\u2019m considering whether it would\nbe my best bet to return to London by plane,\ntrain or donkey. The donkey seems like the most\nsure-fire option right now. Weird times for a global\nworld. Weird time for music.\nThose of us on the way out of Imperial have been\nput in a weird position. We aren\u2019t really able to give\nassurance on what will happen to you in your time\nhere, because we have no clue \u2013 we\u2019re the pre-pan-demic people, the PPP (now I\u2019ve thought of the\nBeach House ballad and cried in my sleeve).\nNevertheless, let me take out my soapbox as I am\nwont to do (and I\u2019m not even a physicist) and tell\nyou why it\u2019s important to Hear the Music, just in case\nPaul Johnson hasn\u2019t convinced you yet.\nSonic breadcrumbs are the traces of my life. Now,\nwithout throwing up in my mouth, that means that\nI can tell you for hundreds of permutations of songs\nand moments that are dear to me, exactly how they\nintertwine. Coming to university rigidified these\ndendritic highways and caused them to branch out\nMEGASTYLE.\nI was forced out of my echo chamber (think rigid\nbrickhouse rock \u2013boomer, zoomer, doomer \u2013 if it\nhad a guitar I was there). Back to present \u2013 I am now\nsitting on my couch listening to the new Moodyman\nremix of Dua Lipa\u2019s \u2018Break My Heart\u2019 and shimmying in my seat. Four years ago, I would\u2019ve cringed\nHARD AF BRUH. Point is: don\u2019t underestimate the\npower of music, or your ability to appreciate what is\ncurrently foreign to you, and you\u2019ll live a happy life.\nOr something.\nMiles Gulliford\nHi, I\u2019m Miles, a 4th year chem eng student and\none of Felix\u2019s music editor team this year. I like\nmusic, and while there are currently fewer opportunities about to watch it live, or even share in it with\nfriends, I believe music can be a ray of light in the\nrather gloomy world in which we find ourselves.\nLess time out and about doing whatever it is we\nused to do out means more time in, and whether\nyou are hard at work or taking time for the things\nyou truly enjoy, this means more time when you can\nbe listening to music (or at least in charge of what is\nplaying). The fact that music is the perfect secondary activity while you are focusing on\nsomething else means that the pandemic is the perfect time to expand and\nenrich your listening.\nBut why bother? The language of\nmusic is, for practical purposes, one\nentirely of its own, by this I mean\nthat understanding the psychical or\ncontextual components of music adds\nno value to your life beyond a deeper\nunderstanding of music. But do you,\nthe hard-working Imperial student, not\ndeserve, not need some solace, some\nsliver of beauty amidst the mechanically violent rationality of your studies? I\nwouldn\u2019t be this far into my degree if\nnot for it.\nTherefore reader, I implore you to\nnurture the seed, that mild or powerful\naffection you feel for music, which I am\ncertain that anyone having read this far\nhas, and let it grow by challenging your\nears and cherishing each sound you\ntake in. I hope that we Felix editors can\nguide you as you grow.\nMeet Your Music Editors!\nFeature\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH FEBRUARY 2020\n31\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nIt\u2019s hard to write about Detroit guys. They\u2019re all a bit\nout there. All a bit intense. And they\u2019re very serious about their music. They\u2019re either all fa\u00e7ade or no\nfa\u00e7ade at all, depends on how you look at it.\nOmar S is chief amongst them. His breakout full-length was called It Can Be Done But Only I Can Do\nIt, featuring an early 2000s Need For Speed-inspired\ncover of the man himself, wearing a fat jacket and a\nbucket hat, along with the most horrible font ever\nprinted anywhere.\nThese kinds of artists will always be the most po-larising. They\u2019re not giving you much wiggle room\nto form your own opinion. Can you not love a guy\nwho is so true to Detroit that he held a permanent\njob in the Ford factory until only a\nfew years ago, goes\nstreet racing at\nnight, and calls all\nEuropean minimal\ntechno \u2018absolute\ngarbage\u2019? I may\ndisagree with the\nlast of these, but\nprops to him for calling them how he sees them.\nAnyways, his newest EP isn\u2019t really all that good,\nbut it\u2019s good enough for an EP which is apparently\nnothing more than a lash out against RA for having\nreviewed his previous release, his first full-length in 4\nyears, poorly. His lack of adventurousness in production was compared to the steadiness of a Ford Fiesta.\nHe might have a case to be salty.\nEnough about the man, let me tell you how the\nsound goes in a single paragpraph. Simply is too sim-ple, a tad boring with just the undulating \u2018OOH,\nDAMN\u2019 sample and some pad-glued drums to keep\nitgoingoverthefourtonebassline.It\u2019son\u2018GonnaLuv\nYou\u2019 that Omar shines for me. It starts with a brittle\nchord over a crunchy beat, which gets swallowed up\nin some wickedly constipated laughing from the man\nhimself. This then flows into a beautiful sax sample,\nand the rest of the track goes swimmingly. The production highlight is a timely filter-and-flanger descent into the last minute. \u2018Bread Over Bed\u2019 is very\nold-school, but again on the boring side, with a single\nsemi-intriguing melodic line amidst a flurry of hats.\nThe last two tracks are more intriguing again, with\nan even more old-school touch, and some very deft\nmoves from John FM on the closer (another Detroit\nlocal with a new EP worth checking out).\nAll in all, good try Omar, if nothing else, then for\nthe lolz.\nFelix Reccomends...\nReviewed by Martin Ferlin Music Editor\nEPby: Omar S\nToptracks: Gonna Luv You, Mell\u2019like Boom\nBoom In\u2019dair;\nRunTime:28 minutes;\nAlbum Reviews\nTo Feel Alive\nKali Uchis has outdone herself with this one,\nproving her potential beyond the stellar discography she\u2019s already built up. In four songs and\n10 minutes, she paints pure impact with a palette as\nvibrant as a full album. The tracks glide beautifully\ninto one another both sonically and thematically as\nKali recounts the stages of a short but intense flame\nlove-affair. On \u2018honey baby\u2019, Kali\u2019s inflecting voice\nbrings together lullabying keys, bird song and easy\ntrap and bass layers like, well, honey. She fawns over\nReviewed by Asad Raja Music Editor\nEPby: Kali Uchis Toptracks: honey baby; TO\nFEEL ALIVE;\nForfansof: SZA; ABRA\nRunTime:10 minutes;\nthe eternal sunshine of mutual belonging and long-ing. \u2018angel\u2019 captures the soothing high of the love-drug, with Kali taking a more mellow vocal approach\nover bass-buried synth runs that climb and fall like a\ntide. Things shift as diffuse keys over a pulsing drum\non \u2018i want war\u2019 express a falling off a tightrope of\ninfatuation into neighbouring insanity. The EP ends\nwith \u2018TO FEEL ALIVE\u2019, an awakening from the\nentire experience, as Kali is left to reflect on the void\nthat a short, intense period of infatuation leaves; a\nvoid it was there to fill all along. Teasing, climbing\nstrings are the plain backdrop for Kali\u2019s stretched\nvocals and pained lyrics, gripped with emotion.\nThe urge to immediately hit pay again is telekinetic,\nand an effective metaphor for the cyclical nature of\ndesire.\nReviewed by Miles Gulliford Music Editor\nEPby: Etuk Ubong Toptracks: Africa Today\nForfansof: FelaKuti;Sonsof Kemet\nRunTime:36 minutes;\nAfrica Today\nSimply (Fuck Resident Advisor)\nNigerian trumpeter Etuk Ubong has created a\nrecord that cuts decisively through the increasingly dense afrbobeat/jazz scene with Africa Today\nand in doing so captures the emotional power of his\npredecessors. With muscular horn sections delivering tight \u2013 dance influenced arrangements (perhaps\nnot so far removed from Shabaka Hutching\u2019s sons of\nKemet) and propulsive percussion drawing upon by\nthe ritual drumming style of the Ekombi, the dense\npropulsive bodies of each track make a thrilling experience for the ears.\nHowever, Ubong wields texture to his advantage\nthroughout this excursion, often stripping instrumet-als back, making for a more varied listen and allowing him to deliver more meaningful and powerful\nmessages on politics and spirituality.\n\n"

    "content": "Advert after advert, trailer after trailer \u2014 our grand\nreturn to cinema is finally here. Tenet certainly has\nthe spectacular visuals, the action/thriller storyline, and\nthe temporal hijinks that we have come to expect from\nNolan. The plot is full of ambition, foisting upon the\naudience numerous moving parts requiring a level of vigilance few directors are willing to demand from audiences\nthese days. John David Washington\nand Robert Pattinson put in some\ndecent performances as the stoic\nspies \u2014 especially given that the\nfilm is like an audiobook at times,\nand the chemistry between Russian\noligarch Andrei (played by Kenneth\nBranagh) and his tormented wife\n(Elizabeth Debicki) adds a much\nneeded human element to this fairly\nemotionless film. With a beefy 150\nminute run-time, Tenet demands\nyour full attention and constant engagement with the puzzles it poses.\nFrustratingly, the dialogue is barely\naudible in several scenes and is an irritating\nbarrage of exposition, with little consolidation or emotional underpinning. What was\nintended as thrilling, came off only as tiring.\nThere are certainly some movies that make\ntheir name solely on the basis of their labyrinthine plots (cf. Primer (2004)), but Tenet\nis not one of them. Underneath the mildly\ninteresting technology is a fairly unremarkable story; and amid the tiring tsunami of\nexposition, there\u2019s a noticeable shortfall of\ntact and grace \u2014 things Nolan masters in\nDunkirk and Inception. Ultimately, Tenet\nisn\u2019t the spy-fi bang I\u2019d hoped for, but boy\nam I glad we\u2019re back.\nLockdown Flop or Summer Success?\nBegin with a classic: The Breakfast Club\nEditor Recommends\n\u201cLife is just a series of peaks and troughs, and you don\u2019t\nknow whether you\u2019re in a trough until you\u2019re climbing\nout, or on a peak until you\u2019re coming down. And that\u2019s\nit, you know, you never know what\u2019s round the corner.\nBut it\u2019s all good\u201d \u2014 D. Brent\nIt\u2019s true that we give nothing so generously as our advice.\nI\u2019d also venture that, when you\u2019re not looking for it,\nthere\u2019s nothing more patronising to receive. For the first\nissue I thought I\u2019d share some advice, but hopefully not in\nthat preachy, finger-wagging way. Given that the cinemas\nare regaining their strength, I thought I\u2019d recommend a\ntrue classic to make my point for me. My coming-of-age\nselection, perhaps unsurprisingly, is The Breakfast Club:\na quintessential \u201880s movie, garnering nostalgia-driven\npraise from the old and young alike. The film is a goodbye\nto high school and, dare I say, to childhood. It features\nthe entire gamut of high-school characters \u2014 the brain,\nthe athlete, the princess, the criminal, and the basket case\n\u2014 stuck in a Saturday morning detention, struggling to\nfind their place at home, and struggling to let go of the\nstereotypes, routines, and familial mannerisms imposed\non them. Although director John Hughes has had his\nshare of big hits \u2014 being the writer and producer of the\nHome Alone trilogy \u2014 the emotion, sincerity, and truth\nin The Breakfast Club is second to none. While the film is\nnostalgic \u2014 perfectly portraying those aspects of school\nwe come to miss, its real strength is that it tells us what we\nreally ought to gain from an education.\nAs the Breakfast Club concludes, and what I can attest\nto as a 4th year, is that an education isn\u2019t about learning\nphysics, biochemistry, or computer science, nor is it even\nabout the social side of uni. The true benefit of education\nis developing an awareness to choose which behaviours,\nwhich customs, and which patterns of thought you\nvalue and give meaning to in adult life (and all its unsexy\nassociations)\u2014 as opposed to falling into such things\nunconsciously. As Brian (the nerd) mentions of their\ndetention teacher Mr Vernon (Paul Gleason): \u201cYou see us\nas you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most\nconvenient definitions\u201d.\nYou will be tested in this way at\nuni. Going shopping at 10pm after\na long day studying, because all\nyou have is some wilting spinach,\nsome soured milk, and the ar-se-ends of some seeded bread you\nthought you\u2019d try but now hate.\nAnd maybe you have a report due\nthe next day. And maybe you get\nto Tesco and they\u2019ve just closed,\nand so you have to travel a mile\nto the next one where everyone is\ngrumpy and tired and the baskets\nare broken, etc etc. A truly well-adjusted person will be\nable to choose not to fall into the default channels of\ngetting pissed off, indignant, or overly upset \u2014 and how\nmuch you know about Maxwell\u2019s equations or enzymolo-gy will have nothing to do with this ability. Being a nerd,\na jock, or a beauty queen is easy; however, stepping back,\nand consciously deciding which habits, pretences, and\ninclinations are truly worth your time is unbelievably\ndifficult.\nPerhaps the \u2018Breakfast Club perspective\u2019 will sound like a\nnauseating clich\u00e9; but, as with most clich\u00e9s, they usually\nend up being true. I think the message and optimism\nwithin this movie will do you good whether you\u2019re a fresher or a postgrad.

    "content": "Anew year at university is beckoning. For\nsome, it will be their first, and for some, their\nlast. One thing we all share is the fact that this\nyear will be nothing like one we have experienced\nbefore. With the current \u201cRule of 6\u201d, as well as\ncollege level restrictions in halls, none of us are\ngoing to be able to go on mad nights out quite as\nmuch as we would like to. Worried about making\nnew friends during this time? Well, you shouldn\u2019t\nbe! Video games are\nan amazing way to get\nto know people, while\nhaving lots of fun\ndoing it. Here is a list\nof what I think are the\nbest co-op games you\ncan play to make new\nfriends this year.\nHuman: Fall Flat\nThis is the perfect\ngame for any puzzler\nfan. With 2 players\nlocal co-op and up to 8\nonline, the wobbly physics make for great laughs as\nyou and your friends attempt to move your avatars\nthrough seemingly simple stages. Delightfully minimal in concept, Human: Fall Flat excels at just being\ndamn fun and proving that you don\u2019t always need an\nextremely convoluted storyline or control system to\nmake a game fun. It is available for PS4, XBOX One,\nSwitch and PC \u2013 with the PC version allowing players to build their own levels for an extra layer of fun.\nA Way Out\nIf you find yourself getting particularly close to\nsomeone and ready to move onto the next level \u2013 I\nwould highly recommend A Way Out, developed by\nthe same people who made Brothers: A Tale of Two\nSons. This game was made for 2 players, meaning it\nhas unique co-op mechanics, seamless split-screen,\nand a twist at the end that will drive you crazy. In A\nWay Out, you and a friend of your choice attempt to\nescape prison, loaded with breath-taking set-pieces,\nenvironmental puzzles and even some shooting in\nthere. Available for PS4, XBOX One and PC, A Way\nOut offers 6-8 hours of multiplayer gameplay, with\nonly one person needing to own the game\u2026 even if\nyou play online!\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe\nEveryone knows Mario Kart. Everyone loves Mario\nKart. Do I even need to describe Mario Kart? Drive\nround intricately designed tracks, use a myriad of\nweapons to knock down opponents, jump over\nramps and twist upside down to race to the finish\nline. Mario Kart in non-stop fun for up to 4 players\nin person. If you have a switch and a pair of joycons\nthen bam, you can have 2 players any time anywhere\u2026 I would be lying if I said I haven\u2019t sneaked\na couple of rounds in during lectures \u2013 which also\nremains true for the next game.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nSuper Smash Bros. Is a fighting game series that goes\nback to the N64 era of Nintendo, pitting famous\ncharacters from all over gaming against each other\nin a battle of pure skill (unless you use items then\nit\u2019s a lot of luck too). Ultimate is truly the complete\nexperience of the game, with a low barrier to entry\nbut a high skill ceiling, it is ideal for playing with up\nto 8 friends on the Switch. Being on the Switch, it is\nalso extremely portable \u2013 meaning on the occasions\nwhere you can go visit people, it is a great low-hassle\nthing to bring to any gathering.\nDeath Squared\nA charming, isometric puzzle games where you\nand up to 3 friends play as cubes trying to navigate\nincreasingly complex scenarios seems like a perfect\ngame for you visual learners out there.

    "content": "The satirical historical dramedy starring Elle\nFanning and Nicholas Hoult is a triumph\nFRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nTELEVISION\nTelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n37\nThe Great\nBinge of the week\nIf one had to put \u2018The Great\u2019 into a box and label it\nwith a genre, the most concise way to do so would\nbe by calling it a satirical historical dramedy.\nThere is a lot to unpack within those three words:\nSatirical \u2013 To say that the show takes the piss out of\nits characters would be the understatement of the\ncentury. What\u2019s interesting about the way The Great\ndoes this is the unique tone it has while doing so. It\nputs the characters into absurd situations (often by\ntheir own doing) and it makes some bold choices in\nthe process. Some of these choices dance along the\nline of going too far (be it the jokes or the gory vis-uals). Some viewers would definitely think that the\nshow goes too far, but for me, it went just far enough\nto reinforce its own points in memorable, striking\nways.\nHistorical \u2013 The show revolves around Catherine\nThe Great, a Russian empress who overthrows her\nown husband to rule the country 18th Century...\nwell, at least a wildly fictionalised version of Catherine The Great. The show\u2019s opening card clearly states\nthat this is \u2018an occasionally true story\u2019, and upon\nsome Googling, it is easy to spot the giant liberties\nthe creative team takes to make a more engaging,\npoignant show.\nDramedy \u2013 This show is funny. In fact, it is often\nhilarious. However, calling it a downright comedy\nwould be doing this show a disservice. It\u2019s not that\nthere\u2019s anything wrong with comedies \u2013 I love a good\ncomedy. However, The Great simply uses its comedic elements as a tool to embellish on the dramatic\naspects and create a unique take on the lives of these\nhistorical figures.\nThe Great was created by Tony McNamara who was\none of the writers of a different highly fictionalised\nmonarchical production The Favourite, which gave\nOlivia Colman her deserved win at the Oscars last\nyear. Tonally, there are definite similarities in the\nway the two approach storytelling, however, they are\nboth unique enough to hold their own as individual works with extremely different takes on what it\nmeans to be a woman in a position of relative power.\nThe Great is an unashamedly feminist piece, howev-er, this does not feel forced at any point.\nElle Fanning (Maleficent, 20th Century Women)\nand Nicholas Hoult (Skins, The Favourite) are both\nmagnetic in their roles. They are oozing with chemistry throughout the show, and the \u2018frenemy\u2019 dynamics\nbetween the pair is beautifully executed. Fanning,\nwho has spent much of her career being compared\nto her older sister Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam, Once\nUpon a Time in Hollywood), not only holds her\nown in The Great, but fully embodies the character.\nThe supporting cast holds their own too. Phoebe\nFox who plays the lady-turned-servant Marial with\ngravitas, in the most charming way possible.\nThe Great is a brave and unique show that is unafraid\nof pushing the boundaries. While it may not be accurate enough to act as a history lesson, it is thoroughly\nenjoyable.\nElle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult ooze charizma\nThe Great\nReviewed by Ozbil Ege Dumenci Television Editor\nStarring: Elle Fanning, Nicholas Hoult\nEpisodes: 10 (45-55 minutes) (1 season)\nCredits: Courtesy of Hulu\nCredits: Courtesy of Hulu\nFrenemies.\nFrenemies.\n\n"

It is hard in a city like\nLondon to make time and space to be\nin nature; however, cultivating this relationship and respect for the processes\nthat make life possible, is integral to our\nbehaviour change.\nIt is not possible to work towards\na more sustainable earth whilst there\nis still widespread global inequality\nin terms of GDP and consumption\nof resources. The current functioning\nof international economics is driving\nclimate and ecological breakdown\nthrough overconsumption, which is\nhaving a disproportionately greater\nnegative effect on the Global South,\nperpetuating global inequality and\nfinancial instability.

Our need for\nconstant economic growth to prevent\nrecession will never alleviate poverty\nbut instead sustain unequal wealth\ndistribution.\nIncome inequality has social repercussions alongside environmental\nimpacts as a result of higher income\nand affluence creating overconsump-tion.\nSo, those with the power of affluence do have the responsibility to\nmake better decisions when purchasing goods and services. Responsibility not only lies with the consumer but\nalso with corporations extracting and\nproducing resources and their regulatory systems. According to data from\nthe Carbon Majors Report in 2017,\nmore than 70% of greenhouse gas\nemissions are produced by just 100\ncompanies, highlighting the responsibility of corporations and investors\nin tackling climate change and reducing emissions.\nProducing zero emissions\nof greenhouse gases is not\ncompatible with economic growth as growth creates\ndemand for energy which\nmakes it harder to cover\nsuch demand with renewable resources. Our economy must grow by 3% each\nyear to avoid a recession,\nso it doubles in size every\n20 years. According a paper\nco-published by the Centre\nof Environmental Systems\nResearch, this growth has direct effects on global resource use so that by\n2050 our material consumption will\nbe 260% over the safe limit (we are\ncurrently 60% over limit).\nFurthermore, even with the optimistic assumptions of rapid technological innovation and taxes on\nresource extraction, our global consumption of resources will still be\n164% over the safe limit by 2050.\nTechnological advances are not outrunning increases in consumption\nworldwide. So, it is not enough to\njust \u2018green\u2019 our consumption by implementing more efficient technology we must also reduce consumption\ndramatically in the Global North.\nThe IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) proposes the\nscaling down of material throughput\nand resource use. This type of post-growth economic shift would involve\nprioritising wellbeing and ecological\nstability over GDP growth. Countries\nin the Global North, such as the UK,\nhave a greater responsibility to reduce their environmental impact by\nreducing resource use and energy use\nso that renewable energy can cover\ndemand.\nConstant economic growth is one\nof the most hegemonic ideas in our\ncurrent society, and it is causing global ecological and climate breakdown.\nIndividual changes in day-to-day\nhabits are useful and contribute to\ncreating consciousness of our impact\nof living on earth. Although, to make\nreal change, a politically significant\nnumber of people must reject GDP\nas a measure of the quality of life.\nAlongside some lifestyle changes, we\ncan also:\nIndividual behaviour change is not enough\nFRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nSUSTAINABILITY\n-Denounce unjust economic policies\n-Advocate for a post-growth so-cio-economic transition\n-Show solidarity with those most affected by climate change\n-Increase our communities\u2019 ecological literacy\n-Put pressure on Imperial to divest\nfrom fossil fuels\nJoining a direct-action group,\nsuch as Divest Imperial and Extinction Rebellion Imperial, is also a\nsustainability tip. It is vital to examine how we contribute to the current\ncapitalist system and how we can\nde-program ourselves from these\nvalues. Our current mindset of individualism and growth-at-all-costs\nis a manifestation of the one-dimen-sional rationalist thought created by\na severe lack of connection with na-ture. Therefore, the climate and ecological crises can also be envisioned\nas a spiritual crisis lacking a cos-movision. We can release ourselves\nfrom these neo-liberal capitalist, de-structive, extractive values by having deeper spiritual practice within\nour communities.\n51\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\n23-45%\nof global environmental\nimpact is created by the top\n10% of income earners\n1.

If you are\nconfined to a small space, finding the\nmotivation to break the habit or routine of being a COVID-couch potato\ncan be incredibly difficult.\nLevel of confinement varied from\ncountry to country; some people were\nable to leave their homes while others\nwere forced to stay in a single room. I\nempathise with the latter. I was only\nable to run in a confined space of 10\nmeters back and forth; it\u2019s impressive\nhow much a 5km run works the calves\nwhen you have to\nalmost continuously turn 180 de-grees. The reason\nfor this lunacy was\na two-week mandatory quarantine\nin a hotel room\nin Australia; I am\nnot a fitness fanat-ic, I just had to do\nsomething to fill\nup 16 hours of the\nday for 14 days to\nstop myself from\ngoing crazy and\nthere are only so many movies you can\nwatch a day.\nAfter hours of scrolling through Instagram,Iendedupfallingdownarabbit\nhole of watching videos of people doing\nhome workouts in the time of COVID.\nWatching many people getting fit does\nbring out a certain motivation (or guilt)\nto exercise as well. However, the struggle then comes to try to find exercises\nto do. Many people who\npost \u201cno equipment\u201d\nworkouts leave small\nfootnotes saying, \u201capart\nfrom some dumbbells,\nkettlebells, and exercise\nbands\u201d, which might\nmost people don\u2019t just\nhave laying around.\nEven after finally finding exercises I\ncould do with my own\nbody weight, I realized\nI wasn\u2019t as motivated\nto push myself to finish\nsets and would often\nfind myself finishing early. Noticing\nthis, it took even more energy to try to\nforce myself to keep going.\nThe silver lining of it all after getting\nmyselfthroughafullbodyweightwork-out, was realizing I felt just as accomplished and as sore (and had worked\nout muscles I didn\u2019t know existed) as if\nI had done a hard day of weights. Once\nyou accept the limitations of the exercises and work with what you have, you\nrealize you can still make the most of it\nand still get the exercise you need from\nit.\nHowever, this is in no way to try and\ntell anyone that they should or could\nhave exercised during quarantine. It is\ncompletely ok if you didn\u2019t work out.\nIt was a very challenging time and there\nis no need to put that extra pressure\non yourself. There is no point trying\nto exercise if it\u2019ll strain and drain you\nmentally and emotionally or if you just\ndon\u2019t feel like doing it. This was just to\ntry and put into words the multiple aspects as to why it is so difficult to exercise during a world pandemic outside of\nthe obvious.\nStruggles of exercising through COVID\nAmanda Barden Sports Editor\nQuarantine in Australia\nZSL Fellowship\nDriving conservation\nscience together\nDo you study or work in zoology, conservation science or a\nrelated area, or have you been a member for three years or more?\nApply today and help shape the future of our natural world.\nAs a ZSL Fellow, you\u2019ll follow in the footsteps of others such\nas Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley.

    "content": "There seems to be an increasing need for our generation to keep up with current fashion trends. From\nthe latest Nike drop to the E-girl hair, it has become\nthe norm to throw away an item considered \u2018last\nseason\u2019.\nOn average each person in the UK buys 26.7kg of\nnew clothing a year and from this, a huge \u00a3140 million\u2019s worth of clothes are dumped in landfill. The\nwave of fast fashion brands has swept the market.\nWith the added increase from online fashion retailers like Missguided, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing,\nthere has been an increase in inexpensive clothing\ncopied straight from the runway. It can also be seen\nthat the rise of social media marketing and influencers\nhas led to the boom of a throwaway society. So, what\u2019s\nthe issue? Well, fast fashion is damaging not only our\npockets, but also the environment. The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter, contributing more\ngreenhouse gas emissions than the aviation industry.\nThe use of non-biodegradable synthetic materials has\nled to the release of plastic microfibers into the oceans\nand subsequently into the food chain. It is time for a\nmuch-needed wake-up call.\n1DEPOP\nA social shopping app where anyone can set-up an\naccount to sell or buy pre-loved clothes at a negotiated\nprice. From sellers all around the world, you can find\na wide range of items to suit your own style, allowing\nyou to focus on exactly what you want. You can also\nstart your own shop and sell old items that may not fit.\n2Charity shops\nA similar approach but relies on you having to\nleave your bed. Charity shops are a great way to buy\nsecond-hand clothing at a cheap price. Not only limited to clothing, many stores sell books, ornaments and\nkitchenware. There are over 11,000 charity shops in\nthe UK, here are some around Kensington and Fulham.\nin a Post-COVID World\nThe pandemic has efficiently ground the fashion and luxury industry to a halt: as seasonal\ncollections fade away and clothes with longevity\nre-materialize, we wonder what else will come to\nlight as the fashion world adapts to a post-COVID\nworld.\nShopping habits\nPerhaps not necessarily a priority for many but for\nthe everyday shopper, the obvious restyle has been\naround retail routines. Hand sanitisation every\nminute, changing rooms out-of-action, and one-way systems may\nhave drained the therapy out of\nretail therapy.\nIs it fun anymore? Do people\neven want to shop offline any-more?\nWith people\u2019s disposable income\nfor the most part decreasing, money put aside for\ndesigner goods and indulgent purchases may now be\nused for a more long-term fulfilment and investment.\nThe show must(n\u2019t) go on\nMilan\u2019s fashion week still proceeded, as the current\nsituation was apparently not considered a pandemic to some cities, whereas some designers made a\ndecision to turn to other platforms to deliver their\ncollections, largely due to the irresponsible nature of\nlarge gatherings and the travel bans set in place. This\nalso meant that fashion week sales plummeted with\nno international buyers in attendance.\nLondon fashion week transformed into a completely\ndigital event, giving labels the opportunity to get\ninnovative with their fashion expression.\nThe main medium used were live streams, with\nbrands like Armani joining in; with other brands\nfinding other avant-garde ways to connect with the\ncommunity. Of course, social media makes this easier\nwith filters and a bombardment of posts on your\nfeed. And if lockdown/quarantine boredom has\nreally gotten to you, Gucci has a 12-hour behind-the-scenes reel of their collections waiting for you.\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that with new collections\nproving more difficult to fabricate in this contemporary world, a decrease in lines follows suit. Whether\nthe digital age is continued or if futuristic fashion\nexhibitions become the new norm is unknown for\nthe moment.\nA more ethical industry\nLess negative repercussions on the\nenvironment have cropped up as a result\nof a reduced production of clothing and\ntheir dyes. Namely, the lowered carbon\nemissions and minimised aquatic toxicity\nas an outcome make for a strong step in the right di-rection. This time of reflection has allowed us to contemplate the ethics and politics of fashion. With the\ndesire to be frivolous with cash diminishing and the\npush to bring fast fashion to a standstill, sustainable\nshopping through charity shops and rental systems,\nsuch as that of Selfridges, is a replacement for this\nseason\u2019s new trend. The impact of overproduction\ncan be reconsidered long-term and the welfare of the\nworkforce behind the clothes rails can be reassessed,\noverall creating a more pleasant industry.\nDespite the fashion world around us changing, we\ncan hope it\u2019s for the better and brings more resource-ful, visionary vogue to the world post-COVID.\nFASHION\nElizabeth Tong Fashion Writer\nAVANT-GARDE\nWAYS TO\nCONNECT\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020\nFASHION\n33\nFashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSimran Gill Fashion Editor\nFIGHT FAST\nFASHION\n3Beware of Green-Washing\nApart from second-hand clothing, many retailers\nhave taken it upon themselves to start promoting an\neco-friendlier image by using misleading claims.
