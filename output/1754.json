    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n22 Sustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSUSTAINABILITY\nShell loves to gaslight us\nOn the 2nd of October 2020, Shell\n(that big energy company) tweeted\nto its 550,000 followers, \u2018What are you\nwilling to change to help reduce emissions?\u2019 with an attached poll for people\nto choose between 1) Offset emissions\n2) Stop flying 3) Buy electric vehicle 4)\nRenewable electricity. This poll sparked\noutrage on Twitter from environmental-ists, scientists and activists alike, including big-names Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Rainforest\nAction Network.\nIn an attempt to maintain their social\nstanding, Shell hid some of the replies\nfrom the Twitter thread. One popular\nresponse that was hidden by Shell was\nfrom climate scientist Professor Katharine Hayhoe, \u2018What am I willing to do?\nHold you accountable for 2% of cumulative global GHG [greenhouse gas]\nemissions.\u2019\nShell has produced 1.7% of all greenhouse gases emitted since 1988. This\npercentage may seem small, but this is\njust from one corporation. There are\nmany other corporations, just like Shell.\nWhen we put these corporations togeth-er, we get the horrifying statistic of 1/3\nof all carbon dioxide emissions being\nproduced by only\n20 companies.\nIn a fol-low-up tweet,\nShell stated\nthat \u2018Changing the energy\nsystem requires\neveryone to\nplay their part\u2019,\ntrying to shift\nthe accountability onto\nthe consumers\nand spread the\nblame across\nus all a whole\nbody. This is\npure manipulation of the reality that Shell\nand other fossil fuel companies have created over the past couple of decades.\nShellknewinthe1980sthattheburning of fossil fuels would lead to\nglobalwarming.In2018,a1988\nconfidentialShellreportwasun-veiled. This report highlighted\nthe mechanism in which using\nfossilfuelasenergywouldcreate\nsea level rise, habitat losses, destruction of ecosystems and the\nmelting of the Antarctic. It also\nhighlighted how pursuing this\nindustry would cause changes\ngreater than ever recorded, and\nI assume they would have been\nable to predict the disproportionate effects on people living\nin the Global South from such\nchanges. Yet, Shell still went\nahead and risked the health and\nthe environment all in the name\nof profit and \u2018development\u2019.\nThe media have not ignored\ntheir role in ecocide, but Shell\ncontinues to greenwash (make\nthemselves appear more environmentally responsible by\nsharing disinformation) their\nmission. For example, Shell\nclaims that \u2018they are part of the\nsolution to transitioning\u2019 to\nnet-zero carbon dioxide emissions by\n2050, while at the same time they refuse\nto take responsibility for the harm that\nthey have caused across the globe.\nAccording to a report\nfrom Influence Map,\nsince 2015, the\ncorporations\nShell, Chevron,\nExxonMobil\nand Total have\nspent more than\n$1 billion on\nmisleading climate messaging\nand lobbying.\nFurthermore,\nthis kind of manipulation is\nnot a new marketing strategy;\nit is something\nintegral for the\nsurvival and\nprofitability of\ntheir extractive business. In 2007 Shell\nran an ad declared misleading by the\nAdvertising Standards Authority, with\nthe slogan \u2018We invest today\u2019s profits in\ntomorrow\u2019s solutions\u2019 for the advocating of their oil sands project in northern\nCanada as a sustainable energy project.\nEven worse, in 1991, Shell produced\na documentary called \u2018Climate of concern\u2019 showing the effects of fossil fuels.\nBut at the same time Shell has been lobbying against global warming since the\nearly 90s.\nAdditionally, Shell claims that human rights are central to its business.\nHowever, this is the same company that\nturned the Niger Delta into a disaster\narea, was complicit in the murder of\nKen Saro Wiwa, and polluted Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s\nwaters. Amnesty International is calling\nfor Shell to be held accountable for their\ncrimes.\nAllofthisgoestoshowhowShellcannot greenwash on Twitter and get away\nwith it. We do have power in holding\nbig oil companies accountable, and we\nshould continue to use it. Shell cannot\nbe trusted as a responsible corporation\nwhen it consistently opposes accountability and believing than \u2018Profits and\nPrinciples\u2019 can go hand in hand.\nThis is an important topic of concern\nforallImperialstudentsconsideringthat\nImperial invests in Shell and has a valued\nrelationship with them.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nSHELL KNEW THAT\nBURNING FOSSIL\nFUELS WOULD CAUSE\nGLOBAL WARMING\nIN THE 1980S, BUT\nTHEY WENT AHEAD\nANYWAY KNOWING\nTHE HARM IT COULD\nCAUSE FOR PEOPLE\nAND THE PLANET\n\u201c\nINSPIRATIONOFTHEWEEK\nI have recently started reading the\nthird issue of Shado [See. Hear. Act.\nDo.] magazine, and I love the variation of essays on climate justice, racial\njustice and social justice. It isn\u2019t just a\nmagazine though. It is a self-described\nmultimedia platform driving change\nat the intersection of arts, activism and\nacademia.\nThe publication is accessible reading for everyone and spotlights people\nwho are not usually shined upon is the\ntraditional media. It is a fusion of stunning contemporary art and writings\nby a wide variation of people from all\nover the world. The themes covered in\nthe latest issue range from Indigenous\nPhilosophy in contemporary climate\nactivism to dismantling capitalist systems in the climate crisis. The previous\nissue centres the topic of Global Womxnhood, and it also on my reading list.\nIf you are interested in climate jus-tice, if you care about climate action,\nor if you want to learn more about the\neffects of climate change, I thoroughly\nrecommend reading this. Shado share\ncontent on their Instagram @shado.\nmag and articles on their website, www.\nshadomag.com, where you can also buy\nthe magazine (in print or PDF form).\nThings we love\nShado Magazine\n\n"

For those that aren\u2019t aware, the Union\nCouncil is one of the main policy-making\nbodies of the Union with student representatives from across constituent Union\nleadership, the officer trustees themselves,\nand elected representatives from within\neach faculty. It\u2019s there to set the policy of\nthe Union, vote on public stances and actions that the Union should take, as well\nas to provide a platform of scrutiny and ac-countability.\nThis year\u2019s council meetings are ably\nchaired by Alex Auyung. The agenda itself was relatively sparse, and after a few\nice-breakers in breakout rooms, matters for\ndecision included ratification of the proposed timetable for next year\u2019s leadership\nelections and a change in the name of the\nLGBT officer to the LGBTQ+ officer.\nOne of the papers proposed by a group\nof students within the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine was a public stance\non Access to Medicines. Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) is\nan international organisation who simply\nbelieve that University-developed medicine and healthcare technologies whose\nresearch is publicly funded should be made\naffordableandaccessibletothepublic.This\nis particularly pertinent for the preventable\n\u2018neglected tropical diseases\u2019 where publicly\nfunded research commonly leads to drugs\nthat cost little to make, but due to exclusive\ntransfer of patents to often single pharmaceutical agencies, thus costs thousands of\npounds to buy and heavily limits equitable\nglobal access.\nThe move of the Union to recognise this\ncause means we are now in a position to actively campaign for Imperial College London to sign onto the equitable technology\naccess framework, a charter aimed at licensing transparency that has already been\nsigned by many other Universities across\nthe globe including Oxford, Harvard and\nYale. The Imperial-specific UAEM chapter\nhave already been hard at work engaging\nwith a range of important stakeholders\nincluding the Technology Transfer Office,\nand even promising early discussions with\nProfessor Shattock; the leading figure behind Imperial\u2019s initiative to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. As ICSMSU President, and more widely as a Union, we look\nforward to helping further these conversations and lobbying for change in line with\nour new stance.\nAnother major part of these meetings\nis accountability. The Officer Trustees of\nthe Union (both President and the respective deputies), as well as all the Constituent Union presidents and our Felix editor,\nwere expected to write up and present a\nreport on their activities and field questions from the board. Perhaps the most\ncontroversial moment of the meeting came\nfrom a renewed move for members to seek\nratification of reports via a vote, and specifically whether this should apply to all reports including those by part-time student\nvolunteers or as was originally suggested,\nonly those of full-time sabbatical officers\n\u2013 a conversation set to be picked up at the\nnext meeting on 1st December.\nArguably the best part of council is its\nopen, transparent nature. Any member of\nICU (in other words pretty much every\nstudent at Imperial) is welcome to come\nalong to Council and propose a paper. It is\nultimately a place where the voice of all stu-dents, and the issues you care about most,\nare genuinely empowered, a forum where\nvoices can be heard, and where changes can\nbe made.\nAll papers, reports and minutes from\nCouncil meetings are publicly available on\nthe Union\u2019s website for all to read if you\nwish to see what was discussed in more de-tail.\nThe next Union Council meeting is on\nthe 1st\nDecember and is open to any Union\nmember. More information on the activities of Council and how it operates can be\nfound on the Union website.\nFollow the Felix twitter for live tweeting of\nthe meetings.\nMuntaha Naeem ICSMSU President\n\n"

    "content": "This is because a New York Post\ntweet was taken down as it looked\nlike a hacked tweet. On the other hand,\nTammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat\nsenator, said \u201cI believe the Republicans have called this hearing in order\nto support a false narrative fabricated\nby the president to help his re-elec-tion prospects, the tech companies\nhere today need to take more action,\nnot less.\u201d Outside of political debate,\nthe hearing served as an evaluation of\nSection 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that gives tech\nplatforms immunity from being sued\nover user-generated content. Speaking\nto Section 230, Mark Zuckerberg called\non Congress to \u201cupdate the law to make\nsure it\u2019s working as intended\u201d. On the\nother hand Jack Dorsey said that eroding the foundation of Section 230 could\ncollapse how we communicate on the\ninternet, leaving only a small number\nof giant and well-funded technology\ncompanies.\u201d\nThis would be a terrible situation for\ntech companies worldwide if not dealt\nwith carefully. Furthermore, the hearing\ncould result in additional pressure on\ncompanies to more carefully censor political ads which could have an impact\non the election. However, the latest\npolling average puts Biden ahead of\nTrump nationally but again this does\nnot guarantee a Democrat victory.\nAt the same time, the Department\nof Justice received bipartisan political\nsupport in filing an antitrust suit against\nGoogle (and similar things are happening in the EU). Google was accused of\nanti-competitive practices. Ironically\nafter the news hit, shares of Google\u2019s\nparent company Alphabet Inc. climbed\n1.4%.\nWhy did this happen? Firstly, the lawsuit was already expected by investors\nand it was \u2018priced in\u2019 to the share price.\nThere is also speculation that the lawsuit won\u2019t hurt Google\u2019s revenues from\nits leadership in search advertising.\nMark Shmulik, an analyst at Sanford\nC. Bernstein, told investors on Tuesday that the firm sees \u201climited risk\u201d to\nGoogle from the suit. However, it could\nalso end much worse for Google if it\ngets split up into separate, smaller companies such as Maps, Search, Youtube,\nAndroid OS and\nChrome.\nIn conclusion,\nthese are truly\nvolatile times\nand especially\nfor tech stocks\nwhich are renowned for their\nhigh beta values\n(standard deviation from the\nmean share price), and this can be seen\nalso in VIX (Chicago Board Options\nExchange\u2019s CBOE Volatility Index\n(this reflects stock market\u2019s expectation\nof volatility based on S&P 500 index\noptions)) reaching high\nvalues of almost 40. The\naforementioned fall in\nNASDAQ could be due\nto the worse-than-ex-pected earnings released\nby many companies. Be\nsure to keep following the\nmarkets closely through\nthe remainder of the\nelection period, as very\ninteresting things will\nundoubtedly happen.\nMajor stock indexes play a huge\nrole in investment as we saw with Ant\nGroup\u2019s suspended IPO earlier this\nweek, with so much demand among\ninstitutional investors as Chinese\ninvestors saw them as a must-have. Had\nthe IPO not been suspended following a call from Chinese regulators, the\nstock price would have shot up further\nfollowing public trading on the indexes.\nEven on Wednesday, a few days after\nthis was originally written the extreme\nvolatility with the election pushed tech\nstocks in NASDAQ up by 4%. However, option prices for VIX indicate that\ninvestors are pricing in less volatility for\nafter the US presidential election.\nMore on US market indexes\nA market index effectively\nfollows the performance\nof a basket of stocks, using\na collection of numbers\nwhich are representative\nof different components\u2019\nweighted values.\nHere, the kinds of components can consist of shares,\ncommodities and bonds.\nHowever, investors often\nfollow different market\nindexes to track market\nmovements due to the fact\nthat market index numbers\nare able to indicate the\nrates of both GDP growth\nand inflation.\nMajor market indexes that\ninvestors are familiar with\ninclude the Dow Jones,\nIndustrial Average, NYSE\nComposite Index, Financial Times Stock Exchange\nIndex and Nikkei Stock\nAverage.\nMarket indexes are used\nby investors as a basis for\nportfolio or passive index\ninvesting, in that they are\ntreated as benchmarks\nso then alpha returns can\nbe tracked relatively to\nshow profits or deficits.\nConstructing individual\nindexes would depend\non the relevant party yet\nmost fund managers utilise\nweighted average mathematics via several constitu-ents. In recent times, many\nsustainable investments\nfunds employing ESG\n(environmental, social and\ngovernance) factors have\nmade the shift to track\nmore environmentally\nfriendly indexes such as\nthe MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International)\nESG indexes.\nI\u2019m too embarassed to ask - what is a market index?\nUS ELECTIONS\nARE NOT PRETTY\nFOR MARKETS\n\u201c\nFear and volatility in US market indexes have rose steeply with the anticipation for US election results.\nCredit: Chris Li\nNikhil Narayanan Investment writer\nGeoff Sang Investment editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nINVESTMENT\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n20\n\n"

    "content": "AROUND NOVEMBER 2020\n11\nFelixonline.co.uk\nAfter 20 years of careful counting, the Florida\nelectoral commission\nannounced this week that\nthe Democratic candidate Al\nGore has secured the state\u2019s 29\ncrucial electoral college votes\nin the 2000 election.\nThis will come as a huge\nblow to Republican candidate\nGeorge Bush\u2019s chances of being the next leader of the free\nworld. However, some pundits were quick to point out\nVotes finally in: Gore declared winner in Florida\nCredits: wikimedia\nHANGMAN\nthat Bush Jr, having already served 8 years of the 4-year\nterm may not be too perturbed by the result.\nThe Florida electoral committee, who operate out of\na Tampa trailer park, explained the\nunusual tardiness by describing in\nbreathless terms that \u201ca damn gator\njust up and ate all the damn ballots.\nThen we straight up just lost them\ndown the back of a sofa in Cletus\u2019s\nfront yard.\u201d\nAs a result of this turn of events,\nIt is expected that Mr Gore\u2019s environmental platform will bring huge\nchange to the North American energy sector. When\nAl Gore (middle), with iPhone legend Bono\napproached for comment, an Enron Mobil representative stated \u201cFuuuuuuck.\u201d When pressed for further\nclarification he went on to ask \u201cIf Gore won the elec-tion, by what mandate did we invade Iraq? Now we just\nlook like idiots.\u201d\nThe campaign manager for the president-elect announced the line up for the inauguration party will\nremain largely as planned at the time of the vote, with\nappearances from Ja Rule and Destiny\u2019s Child, and a\nspecial stand up set from beloved comedian and convicted sex offender Bill Cosby.\nHowever, it is not all rosy for the Gore administra-tion, which has already faced harsh criticism for its\ninaction over the 9/11 attacks, the subsequent wars in\nIraq and Afghanistan, and the collapse of the global financial system in 2008. When pressed for comment, a\nspokesperson for the Democratic candidate said \u201cFair\nplay, it did look a lot like they had WMDs.\u201d It was at\nthis point that the representative turned violent, and\nthe interview came to a swift end. An additional sticking point has come from Gore\u2019s involvement in the\n2006 film \u2018An Inconvenient Truth\u2018, which critics say\nbetrays a conflict of interest with regard to the president-elect\u2019s environmental policies. As one Republican\npundit put it to Hangman, \u201cclimate change has clearly\nbeen invented by Mr. Gore to sell more DVDs\u201c. The\nadministration declined our request for comment on\nthe matter.\nIt is expected that vote counting in Nevada for the\n2020 presidential election may take a similar length of\ntime. Pundits predict that by the time a winner is an-nounced, the victor will be retroactively held responsible for a Latin American coup, several baseless middle\neastern wars, and the collapse of the global financial\nsystem.\nCredits: wikimedia / Robert Scobel\n\u201c\nA DAMN GATOR JUST\nUP AND ATE ALL THE\nDAMN BALLOTS...\nBeve Stannon Election Correspondent\n\n"

    "content": "My brief\ndefence of\nabstract movies and\nsurrealism is predicated on them genuinely seeking to\ncapture a feeling or\nconvey some truth.\nWhile this generally holds for surreal movies,\nthere are of course exceptions. Perhaps the most\nfamous of these exceptions is Un Chien Andalou. It\nwas a film intended to deliberately steer away from\nrational interpretations and actively resist the process of seeking to capture truth on screen. Bu\u00f1uel\nsaid that he and Dal\u00ed had only the following\nprinciples in mind when writing the film: \u201cDo not\ndwell on what required purely rational, psychological or cultural explanations. Open the way to the\nirrational. It was accepted only that which struck\nus, regardless of the meaning\u201d. I will not ruin the\nsurprises by listing all the shocking scenes, but suffice it to say that Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed succeed at both\nconfusing you, shocking you, and at mocking the\n\u2018avantgarde cine\u2019 of the time. I hold up Eraserhead\nas an example of convincing you that there is truth\nin surrealist cinema, as a defence of the genre. But\nUn Chien Andalou serves as a criticism of the \u201cinane herd\u201d, as Bu\u00f1uel called them, who see truth in\nanything. It takes aim at those who pass off their\nlack of vision as abstraction, and in that sense is an\nattack on the genre. For those interested in getting\ninto classics, Un Chien Andalou is a great place to\nstart. [Versions of this short exist on Youtube and\non the Archive.]\nFree Film of the Week: Un Chien Andalou\nA Short Defence of Surrealism\nEditor Recommends\nPraises for Eraserhead are often concluded by\na catalogue of asterisks. These clarifications\noften say something to the effect of \u2018good...for an\nexperimental movie\u2019, or \u2018good...for a surrealist piece\u2019,\nor \u2018good...for an abstract work\u2019. They act as though\nsurreal movies ought to be judged by a different criteria than \u2018normal movies\u2019. I heartily disagree. Surrealism is not some disconnected, modern invention.\nProducer Steven Kov\u00e1cs said \u201cSurrealism was the\nfirst literary and artistic movement to become seriously associated with cinema\u201d; it precedes Disney,\nthe zombie genre, the Wilhelm scream, the Cannes\nFilm Festival, and the Academy Awards themselves.\nSurrealism seems more modern than it is partly because it refuses to offer easy explanations. It has taken on a recalcitrant quality, never being shackled by\nconvention or cliche, for those are the very things\nit so effectively dispenses of (though that is often\nnot its primary aim). I think this is, in part, the reason for its enduring liveliness compared to all other\ngenres, some of which are going stale. Contrary to\npopular opinion, surrealism is a simple extension of\nthe artistic tradition, not something at odds with\nit. As T. S. Eliot said \u201cThe progress of an artist is\na continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of\npersonality\u201d\u2014is it so surprising that when the artist\nis finished with himself, that he should then turn on\nreality ?\nAll this is to say that the correct approach when\ngoing into a surreal movie is not to hold your nose.\nThe mindset most conducive to the enjoyment of\nsurreal cinema is that of understanding what it aims\nto do. Film\u2014being only images in sequence\u2014is but\na means to approach truth tangentially. By presenting some sort of objective correlative\u2014be it a story,\na shot, or a symbol\u2014some truth is evoked by expe-rience, without any recourse to logic or analysis. For\nmore obscure truths, feelings, and emotions, more\nobscure modes of transit are required. Do you think\na movie that attempts to capture the essence of the\nsubconscious is going to turn out like Titanic? Of\ncourse not. The best surreal movies will be as strange\nas the truths they seek to uncover, and no stranger.\nWhen one ignores the context, the route up\nMount Everest seems unnatural and absurd, far-re-moved from what we normally get up to. And yet,\nafter years of normalisation, that route is now the\nobvious method for obtaining the unique exhilaration one feels at the top; it has become less absurd,\nand is now simply thought of as \u2018the way you go to\nget to that place\u2019. So stands surrealism in cinema,\nand the dismissal of it as strange and far-flung is true\nonly when one neglects its context. While it doubtless aims at uncommon ends, its uncommon means\nare no less valid than the tactics of other genres.\nDavid Lynch is intimately aware of these facts. He\njustified his casting of Jack Nance as Henry Spencer in Eraserhead by saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re going into the\nnetherworld, you don\u2019t wanna go in with Chuck\nHeston\u201d. In that choice there is a clear understanding of aim. Conversely, Lynch\u2019s meticulously crafted\nsoundtrack of clanging and crying, knocking and\nwhistling, and his dreamlike aesthetic of shadows\nbroken by spotlights, is not jarring just to be jarring\u2014it is due to a clear understanding of an aim.\nIn terms of filmmaking only, these constructions are\nthose of a master, not an eccentric. What does one\nexpect when the movie\u2019s tagline reveals its aim: \u201cA\ndream of dark and troubling things\u201d? No, Lynch,\nlike Bu\u00f1uel or Jodorowsky, is as conventional as they\ncome; he is simply an extension of a now century old\ntradition of using unfamiliar, but apposite, methods\nto capture strange and distant truths.\nIt may take some time to see the utility in a director\u2019s choice. On first viewing, Eraserhead is a hand-ful. But, on all subsequent viewings, a deeply emotional and deliberately crafted film takes shape on\nscreen. Lynch didn\u2019t call it his \u201cmost spiritual film\u201d\nfor nothing. Eraserhead, like many great surreal pictures that get neglected, is a repository for some of\nthe most delicate themes ever depicted on screen. In\norder to see them, one need only find the rationale\nbehind the madness. When that rationale is understood for what it truly is, all abstractions fall away,\nand what remains are those elusive truths which lie\nunperturbed by conventional form, only ever becoming detectable in the unreality of a dream.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nUn Chien Andalou\nFRIDAY 6TH NOVEMBER 2020\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com 15\nDirectedby: David Lynch\nYearof Release: 1977\nStarring: Jack Nance; Charlotte Stewart\nDirectedby: Luis\nBu\u00f1uel;\nSalvador Dal\u00ed\nYearof Release: 1929\nEraserhead\nThe most shocking scene in all of cinema according to\nmany\nHenry surrounded, not by dust, but rather by bits of his own\nskull\nCredits: Konstantin Lopushansky\n\u201cEraserhead\u201d by rulenumberone2 is licensed with CC BY 2.0\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cHey Dad look! I spent five grand on\nthis game just within this first minute\nand look! I packed Ronaldo, Messi and\nBen Yedder! Wow! So much skill! I love\nFIFA!\u201d, say an increasing proportion of\nunwitting, uninformed and admittedly\nguiltless video gamers in the age bracket of\n10-15.\nI love football, and I love video\ngaming. The only game I\u2019ve ever known\nof which collides the two realms\ntogether to enjoy them simultaneously\nin one sitting is FIFA. EA, however,\ndon\u2019t seem to feel the same.\nRight, I should admit at this point\nthat someone reading this paper will\nthink \u201cEA? FIFA? Wait, I know about\na team in red and white called Arsenal\nbut apart from that, what on earth is he\ntalking about here? And what are loot\nboxes? Where is this going?!\u201d\nSo, to sort this all out, I\u2019ll briefly\nexplain who EA are and what FIFA is.\nEA (or \u201cElectronic Arts\u201d to spell\nout in its entirety) is a Canadian game\ndeveloper based in Vancouver, and they\npublish some of the gaming world\u2019s\nmost prominent titles \u2014 Battlefield,\nNeed For Speed, Plants vs Zombies and\neven Simcity.\nFIFA is its biggest seller. When you\nthink FIFA, think of the big daddy i.e.\nthe McDonalds to your local Chinese\ntakeaway \u2014 it is huge! Just for one of its\ntitles, FIFA 18, 24 million copies were\ndistributed within a 12 month period.\nThe game itself is a football simulator,\ndesigned to replicate all aspects of a\n90 minute football game alongside\ncurated modes for the hardcore gamer\nin Ultimate Team and the casual gamer\nwho wishes to play with his friends for a\nlaugh in Pro Clubs.\nNow comes the crux of the problem,\nor the heart of the matter: EA have\nchanged FIFA. Ultimate Team is its\ngreatest asset when it comes to revenue\nstreams. Players buy specific iterations\nof player items (often referred to as\n\u201ccards\u201d) with in-game currency that\nthey can access using real sterling, euros\nor dollars. Before April 2015, this wasn\u2019t\nnecessary. It was possible to make a\nliving on the video game if you had an\nincredibly poor team but if they were all\nable to run at the speed of Usain Bolt,\nyou could beat anyone, anywhere no\nmatter the team in question. However,\nEA changed this after 2015 so that the\ngame became increasingly dependent on\nthe quality of your team, which in turn\nis proportional to the size of the bank...\naccount one writes off to fund their\nextraordinarily short-term virtual asset.\nFIFA rewards players specific player\nand club related items using \u201cpacks\u201d.\nWhen you think of packs, think of a\nslot machine. When you put in a pound\ncoin and pull the lever, you\u2019ll see some\nresult, whether good or bad it belongs\nto you. Legally in the gaming world it\u2019s\nknown as \u201cloot boxes\u201d, and this is where\nthe problems begin. Kids love gambling.\n\u201cOoh I want to put in a pound coin and\nget the best outcome for my money!\u201d,\nand we can all attest to some moment of\nour lives where this felt true. The sense\nof euphoria when you receive more than\nwhat you paid for is the feeling we crave\nfor as human beings as it lets us indulge\nin a sense of achievement and improved\nposition in the world... [CONTINUED]\nGAMES\n23\nGames.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFIFA International\nSoccer\nReleased: December 15, 1993\nThe first of its illustrious history. The game was well\nreceived at the time, being described as \u201cthe complete\nsimulation of the sport\u201d by Computer Gaming World.\nOf course, this was 1993 so its retro aesthetic is of\nno match to the current iteration in FIFA 21, but it\nmarked the first big step for EA into the football\nsimulator world.\nBig titles in FIFA\u2019s history\nWHAT MY EYE\u2019S ON...\nBlack Ops Cold War - Nov 13\nActivision(Xbox,PS,PC)\nZombies are back, and for the first time\nModern Warfare and Black Ops exist\nin the same world. The beta seemed like\na rough diamond, but will Cold War\ndeliver on the hype? Only time will tell,\nalthough it looks promising so far.\nIt\u2019s game over for FIFA loot boxes, EA.\nAhmad Danesh Games Editor\nFIFA 06\nReleased: September 30, 2005\nYes, the game for 2006 was released in 2005.\nHowever, that\u2019s not really the point. FIFA 06 offered\na complete rewrite of the base game engine, yet more\nimportantly, the ball physics felt smoother at the time\ncompared to its previous counterparts - no surprise\nreally that it was awarded a \u2018double platinum\u2019 award\nfor sales.\nFIFA 17\nReleased: 29 September 2016.\nThe last great FIFA. Low driven shots were\nridiculously overpowered and it was the first title\nwith the new Frostbite game engine, which previously\nsupported EA\u2019s Battlefield series. However, the\ngorgeous appeal of the stadiums and the balance of\nthe players made it worthwhile to play (for most of the\ntime).\nSpider-Man Miles Morales - Nov 12\nInsomniacGames(PS4,PS5)\nOne of the true PS5 reveal gems - the\ngraphics look stunning, the storyline\nappears engaging and the fight scenes\nlook well choreographed.

The\nnostalgia is what brings me back to the\nseries, but it seems recently with new\nfootage that the game engine renders the\ngraphics from the 2004 era - what on\nearth were they thinking?!\nForza Horizon 4 - Nov 10\nTurn10Studios(Xbox,PC)\nVery few driving simulators match the\nauthenticity and the range that Forza\noffers. One often argues about the\nduel between it and its Playstation\nalternative: Gran Turismo. Turn 10,\nhowever, pulled out the stops this time.\nIt appears Electronic Arts (EA) are feeling the heat in recent times, but how have they got to this point?\nOur gaming editor, Ahmad Danesh discusses.\nCredits: JESHOOTS.com // unsplash.com @JESHOOTS\n\n"

    "content": "This question gave students the opportunity to select their feeling on a slider scale from \u2018very angry\u2019 to\n\u2018very happy\u2019. Only 1 person said they were \u2018very happy\u2019,\nfollowed by only 3 for \u2018happy\u2019. Although this reflects\nwhat I had observed among friends and family, I was\nstill surprised at how negative the response was. At the\nsame time, I do struggle to imagine that there would\nbe overwhelming elation. University is expected to be\na social experience, as well as an educational one of\ncourse, but COVID-19 has restricted a lot of freedoms\nsince March.\nQ6. IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY LIVING\nAWAY FROM HOME (HALLS OR PRIVATE\nACCOMMODATION), DO YOU INTEND TO\nMOVE BACK HOME, OR WILL YOU STAY\nPUT?\nIt seems that despite the uncertainty around the exodus of students around the Christmas holiday, most\nrespondents, except one, do not intend to willingly return home right now.\nQ7. HOW WILL THE COMING LOCKDOWN AFFECT PARTS OF YOUR LIFE? (E.G.\nDAILY ROUTINE, RELATIONSHIPS, WELLBEING)\nThese responses provided explanations for why there\nwas a common feeling of discontent. Across the sam-ple, students seemed to share concerns around the effects of the lockdown on wellbeing, mental health, relationships and work.\nOn the topic of wellbeing, many felt that the lock-downwouldcauseadipintheirmentalhealthandwell-being. It became apparent to me that the restrictions,\ncoupled with the current state of remote learning, will\nleave some students feeling isolated. One student said\nthat they expect to \u201cfeel lonely\u201d, citing the fact they already have little social interactions, and they thought\ntheir mental health would take a decline. Some felt\ntheir work-life balance would become a struggle to\nmanage, which is already a challenge for most Imperial\nstudents.\nIt was apparent that the likelihood of increased\nscreen time and reduced face-to-face interactions have\nmost reeling in anger. Suprisingly, there were a small\nnumber of respondents who were impartial or saw a\nsilver lining in the dark cloud. One student said they\nhave been living in a \u201cpersonal lockdown\u201d under the\nbelief that most people should have been venturing\noutside for essentials only. Another saw this lockdown\nas an opportunity to spend more time to \u201cwork and\nconcentrate on studies\u201d. Of course, students have been\nliving under restrictions since the start of term so it is\nno surprise that one student claimed that they would\nsee little change as they \u201cbarely leave the house most\ndays anyways\u201d. With another student responding with\n\u201cnot very much\u201d since their course is online anyway.\nConcerns around maintaining romantic relationships were also abundant. One student in a long-dis-tance relationship that spans \u201cseveral countries\u201d said\nthat they felt little motivation to endure this month.\nThe financial consequences of a second lockdown\nwere also a concern for some of the 47 respondents.\nOne student recognised that they personally weren\u2019t\naffected by the news, but since it is not good for their\nfamily\u2019s financial situation it will negatively impact\nthem regardless. Another student shared they expected a reduced income, stating that \u201cfurlough only covers\n80% of an average\u201d.\nFitness was another popular topic, it was clear for\nthose who regularly work out, the lockdown poses a\nhindrance to their fitness. Someone said that the closure of gyms would \u201cdestroy their daily routine\u201d, another held out hope that sports will stay on but they also\nexpressedahopelessnessattheremovalofthefreedoms\nthatmaketheir\u201clifeworthliving\u201d.Ithinkthelatteremphasies the role physical activity plays in the wellbing\nfor quite a large faction of our student population. Although I cannot relate to the sports culture, I can see\nhow the news will be a big blow to those who already\nhad to go months without the gym in the first lock-down. That being said, there was an ambigous respone\nof \u201cno more gym!!!\u201d, which I still cannot decipher as a\npositive or negative reaction.\nThe impact of a second lockdown on daily routines\nfor most students ranged quite a bit. It is important to\nkeep in mind that not all students live in student accommodation and for respondents who fitted into this\ncategory, some expressed a frustration at the quality of\ntheir work environment. One person said that they expect their home environment to become \u201cmore hectic\u201d\nif family members end up staying home instead of going to work or school. For one respondent it seems to\nbe the restriction on simple, everyday things, like buying paper, that they will miss. They also expressed slight\ndespair at the confinement of a world that only exists\n\u201cinside the four walls of your flat\u201d.\n\u201cPret\u201d also came up as a major concern for two re-spondents, but I think Pret is a bit overrated anyway so\nI will not delve into that.\nQ8. AS A STUDENT, DO YOU THINK THE\nSTRICTER MEASURES WILL NEGATIVELY\nOR POSITIVELY IMPACT YOUR STUDIES?\nThe majority felt that the lockdown would have\na negative impact. For most of these students, it\nseems that the removal of their social interactions\nor daily routines will destabilise their general wellbeing to the point where they will struggle to focus\non studies. I think this is pretty understandable, as a\nmechanical engineering student, I know how easy it\ncan be to fall into the trap of spending every minute\nof every day on work. I try very hard to avoid that\ntrap, as do many people I know. However, soon the\nopportunities to take time away with friends or family will be very limited.\nI can also imagine that for 1st year students, the\nnews couldn\u2019t be more anti-climatic for a cohort\nwho so far have not experienced the true fresher ex-perience.\nThere were a few who felt the positive however,\nand those that elaborated on their stance shared a\nhope that lockdown would improve productivity.\nOne student said they will have more time to sleep\nwhich may in turn benefit their progress, at the same\ntime they reckoned that they may end up being less\nproductive than they hope.\nThere were a few who were neutral, stating that\nlockdown would make little difference to their current remote learning.\nQ9.IFYOUDISAGREEWITHTHEUKGOVERNMENT\u2019S DECISION, WHAT ACTION(S)\nWOULD YOU HAVE PREFERRED?\nI was honestly slightly surpised at the volume of suggestions in response to this question. I think I expected\nmore people to think lockdown was the only way to go\ngiven the projections. For these respondents though,\nthey seem to be aware of the severity of the situation\nfacing us, its just that they would rather other rigorous\nactions were taken.\nSome of the respondents clarified that they agree\nwith the lockdown, but expressed that there could be\nmore thought given to other solutions. For example,\none person said that they agree with the move but think\nlong-term measures such as \u201cregular, targeted testing\u201d\nshould be employed to avoid the possibility of multiple\nlockdowns.Anotherstudentexpressedmorediscontent\nwith the management of the COVID-19 response, stating that the government is incompetent for letting cases\nrise to the stage they are \u201cwithout \u2018real\u2019 interventions\u201d.\nThere were a few other students who agreed with\nthe lockdown but disagreed with the conditions under\nwhich it was placed. Three students reckoned that the\nlockdown decision came too late, with one elaborating on their stance by saying that university students\nshould not have returned to campus. This respondent\nalso echoed the thoughts of another who argued that\na circuit breaker lockdown should have been enforced\nwhen SAGE recommended so in September.\nAlthough universities and schools will remain open,\nwhich is a move most of the respondents supported,\none argued that the move is unjustified since transmission rates are \u201ctoo high to be ignored\u201d.\nSome respondents pointed to the approaches taken\nin other countries; Sweden, China and Slovakia specif-ically.\nMost respondents pointed to stricter enforcement of\nshielding, social distancing and regional restrictions as\nopposed to a national lockdown.\nIn summary, I believe most understand why the second lockdown is happening, but the exasperation and\nanger are tangible. So, I think that this month will be\none of intense anticipation.\nFRIDAY 6TH NOVEMBER 2020\n9\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCOMMENT\n\n"

    "content": "Europe is not particularly well known\nfor its tech companies, with the entire\nindustry being valued at less than half\nof Apple alone. Local companies have\nstagnated or been acquired, leading to\nthis side of the Atlantic having an almost\ncomplete dependence on the US for\nsome of the most important things in\nmodern society. There is one exception\nto this trend, however \u2013 ARM. ARM as\na company is not very well known to the\npublic but is hugely influential in daily\nlife. With over 180 billion processors\nbased on its designs shipped \u2013 including\nin almost every smartphone ever made\n\u2013 it may be the technology we interact\nwith most. The company operates on a\ndifferent model to most others; instead\nof selling its own products, ARM develops intellectual property which it licenses to others, receiving a small royalty on\nevery product shipped that uses its tech-nology.\nThis business model has become the\ndriver behind\nits massive\ns u c c e s s .\nKnown as\nthe \u201cSwitzerland of\nthe semiconductor\nindustry\u201d,\nA R M \u2019 s\nwillingness\nto license\nits IP to\nanyone and\never yone\nhas meant\ncompanies\nhave been\nconfident\nenough to spend billions on R&D underpinning their businesses with ARM\ntechnology \u2013 with Apple, for example,\nmoving all of its products to ARM based\ndesigns in the coming years. This neutrality is something that is threatened by\nthe proposed $40 billion acquisition of\nARM by Nvidia, a company best known\nfor its GPUs. This proposal, in my opin-ion, is not only detrimental to ARM,\nbut also to the European tech industry\nand possibly even national security.\nTo be clear, ARM has not technically\nbeen independent in recent times - after a $32 billion acquisition by Japanese\nconglomerate Softbank in 2016, the\ncompany was removed from the LSE\nand NASDAQ. Despite Nvidia offering\nthe same promises as Softbank made in\nits deal \u2013 such as keeping the company\nheadquarters in the UK, with the UK\u2019s\nmost powerful supercomputer thrown\nin as a sweetener \u2013 there are some key\ndifferences between the two companies.\nSoftbank, despite its massive $100\nbillion \u201cVision Fund\u201d for investing in\ntechnology, is not a player in the semiconductor industry, meaning it is in its\nbest interests to make ARM as open to\nlicensing as possible. Nvidia, on the other hand, operates in the same markets\nas many of the companies that license\nARM technologies, such as Samsung\nand AMD. Nvidia could very easily restrict what licensees could do\nwith their future ARM based\nproducts, raising prices and\nstifling innovation \u2013 and\nwith a reputation for an-ti-competitive behaviour,\nthis is not inconceivable.\nWithout any legally bindingguarantees,Nvidia\u2019s\npromises that it will\ndo the right thing are\nmeaningless.\nThe second issue\nwith Nvidia taking\nownership of ARM\nis the fact that it is headquartered in the USA. The\nTrump Administration has\nincreasingly embraced pro-tectionism,placingsomeforeigncompa-nies, such as Huawei, on what is known\nas the Entity List. Whether these sanctions are justified or not is beyond the\nscope of this article \u2013 what this means,\nhowever, is that all US-based companies\nare barred from trading with the members of the Entity List. The restrictions\ndo not stop there; any foreign companies are also barred from trading with\nthe companies\non the Entity\nList if they\nutilise any\ntechnology\nof US origin\n\u2013 however\nlittle \u2013 in\ntheir prod-ucts. Being\na UK-based\nc o m p a n y,\nARM is immune to this\nlegislation,\nallowing it\nto continue\nto trade with whoever it wishes to. This\nis a very powerful ability to have \u2013 immunity from US sanctions is something\ncountries spend billions developing, for\nexample through Russia, China, and the\nEU\u2019s independent satellite navigation\nsystems. Throwing away this influence is\na clear detriment to national security.\nSoftbank is not selling because it wants\nto \u2013 it is selling because it needs to.\nThrough some bad investments such as\nWeWork and\nthe impact\nof the\ncoronavirus\npandemic, the\nconglomerate\nis in desperate\nneed of cash,\nand as such is\nselling off one of\nits jewels in a last-ditch attempt\nfor some liquidity. One avenue to be\npursued \u2013 favoured by ARM cofounder\nDr Hermann Hauser \u2013 is for ARM to go\npublic again, with the possibility of the\nUK Government taking a stake in the\ncompany.AlthoughtheGovernmenthas\nshown an appetite for such\ndeals recently \u2013 investing\n$500 million for a stake\nin satellite communications company OneWeb\n\u2013 the technological illiteracy of our politicians\nmeans the importance\nof ARM is probably going to fly right over their\nheads, instead viewing\nthe deal as another pawn\nin the post Brexit trade\ndeal negotiations. Other\noptions are likely to be\nequally as problematic\nas the one proposed by\nNvidia \u2013 the kind of organisations with\nthis kind of money tend to be American\ntech companies or state backed invest-mentfunds.Thefinal,mostlikelyoption\nis for the acquisition to be approved,\nwith regulators negotiating legally binding agreements to get around some of\nthe issues with the deal. Unfortunately, it looks as if we will see yet another\npromising European technology company swallowed up for a\nfraction of its potential\nvalue.\nShrey Bohra Tech Writer\nWhy Nvidia\u2019s ARM Acquisition\nShould Be Blocked\nTHIS PROPOSAL\nIS DETRIMENTAL\nNOT ONLY TO\nARM, BUT ALSO\nTHE EUROPEAN\nTECH INDUSTRY\nAND NATIONAL\nSECURITY\n\u201c\nNVIDIA COULD\nVERY EASILY\nRESTRICT WHAT\nLICENSEES DO\nWITH THEIR\nFUTURE ARMBASED PRODUCTS\n\u201c\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n8\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n26 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nExercise in Lockdown 2.0\nHerewegoagain.Thenextfourweeks\nwill be tough for all, many hoped that\nthefirstlockdownwouldbetheonlyone\nthat we would have to go through. Many\nof us, including myself, found it very difficult to keep up with any sort of normal\nexercise that we did before. This greatly\naffected many people\u2019s mental health\nand lifestyle. It is a great shame that all\nof the university sports teams had to\nshut down, especially as we are expected to continue on with studies as we did\nbefore, but it is understandable that as\npeople\u2019s lives outside of universities are\nbeing affected so greatly by the current\nsituation we cannot expect to keep on\nas we did. We all know that exercise can\nhelpwithmentalhealth,thatiswhyweas\na sports editing team are going to try our\nbesttowritehalfanarticleeveryweekon\nsuggestions and tips to help people keep\ngoing through this lockdown. Our first\nrecommendation is to set up a routine\nand try your best to stick to it; remember variation is the spice of life and this\nis especially true in sports. Motivation\nwill be severely lacking at points, I know\nthis is especially true for me, which is\nwhy doing exercise shouldn\u2019t be seen as\nsomething to do when you\u2019re motivated,\nit should be thought of as daily medicine\nto do as part of your routine. Obviously, you must always listen to your body,\nif you are too tired and simply cannot\nface the idea of doing anything then you\nmust of course rest and prioritise recov-ery. A good trick to get over the lack of\nmotivation is to promise yourself that\nfive minutes into that run/cycle/what-ever, if you still feel bad and don\u2019t want\nto keep going, you can turn around and\ncome home. Often, since you\u2019re already\noutside or have setup stuff at home and\nchanged into sports kit, motivation will\nkick in and keep you going. However,\nif you really do feel rough and you still\nwant to come home, you can do so without feeling any guilt; you\u2019ll know that\nyou tried your best. There are plenty of\nsocial media influences who continuously post exercise ideas, and these can\nbe helpful, however it should definitely be noted that during lockdown you\nshould not be comparing yourself to\nthese people who are only posting a glorified version of themselves and what\nthey do; remember, sport is individual\nandyouhavetocompareyourselftowho\nyou were yesterday rather than someone\nelse today. This could be an ideal time to\ntry that first 5K or 10k that you\u2019ve been\nthinking about for a very long time; obviously only do so if you can stay within the regulations of the lockdown and\nfeel safe to do so. I for one struggled for\nmost of my life with running and cardio\nin general but once I came to university\nandstartedrowingIrealisedhowbenefi-cial a quick run with my headphones on,\nblaring out my favourite music, can help\nme at the most stressful and anxious periods in the year. When starting to run,\nyou should be focusing on the length\nof time you are running rather than the\nspeedordistanceyouaredoing.I\u2019dhighly recommend if you\u2019re starting off to try\nand keep your heart rate as low as possible and treat those initial few kilometres\nof your first proper run as a marathon:\nfocus on pacing. There is no point going\nout at what you think is a \u201cnormal pace\u201d\nbut still feels like agony, blowing up in\nfive minutes, and never doing it again. If\nyou have a heart rate monitor it would\nbe a great idea to try and do this run at\nroughly 70% to 80% of your max heart\nrate (a rough rule of thumb is 220 minus your age to find your max heart rate)\nwhich should come out to roughly 140-160BPM. At this heart rate, no matter\nwho you are, you should be able to run\nfor thirty to forty-five minutes straight;\nI can\u2019t guarantee that it will be fun or\nthat it won\u2019t be one of the most boring\nthings you have ever done in your life,\nbut I promise you it is possible. However, it would probably be best to start\nwith a 20-minute run. Remember to increase your length of time gradually and\nconsistently. With running the payback\nand real fun only comes after you have\nput in the time but making sure you stay\nin those heart rate ranges will make it far\neasier and enjoyable to do that time. Of\ncourse, there are many different types\nof exercises to try and we will hopefully\ngo through a few more; running is quite\na nice one to start with, but going into\nwinter and lockdown, we fully understand the hesitation of going outside. If\nyou have any recommendations for exercises that can easily be done in a room,\nwith limited equipment and is not too\ncomplicated then please do get into\ntouch with us and send us an email.\nKonrad Hohendorf Sport Editor\nFelix cryptic Crossword No. 6\nAcross\nDown\n1 Courier delivers end of goalpost to\nbloke (7)\n2 Record unsteady dive after falling ring\n(5)\n3 Soft rock music sound after mixing\nslime (9)\n4 Odd trio reel, dangerously worn-out (5)\n5 Jumbled menu I\u2019m reading is disease\nproof (6)\n6 Tardis rupture!

    "content": "In this week\u2019s issue, we take a closer\nlook at how major stock indexes have\nbeen affected worldwide due to a variety\nof drivers, in particular with what is going on in the European and US markets\nbut we also have an opinion on Chinese\nindexes following suspension of the\nAnt Group IPO, due to have been the\nrecord-breaking IPO with $37 billion\nUSD raised from institutional investors.\nHere is a look at technology in global\nmarkets through the lens of stock indi-ces.\nEurope\nAs for some recent especially recent\nnews, STOXX Europe 600 (a European\nstock index) fell almost 6% this week.\nThis pushed the index to its lowest point\nsince May this year. We can likely attribute this to the fact that investors reacted\nto the further lockdown measures being\nannounced due to the second wave of\nCOVID-19 in countries like Spain and\nItaly, and now also the England national\nlockdown, as well as the upcoming presidential election.\nThe negative impact to European\nmarkets was especially prominent in the\nsoftware giant\u2019s, SAP SE\u2019s, 20% drop in\nshare price last week. This cloud based\nbusiness operations company saw a far\nworse-than-expected\nthird-quarter earnings update. Its shift\nfrom license software\n(with a one-time upfront payment) to\nthe more typical subscription based cloud\ninfrastructure means\nthat profits will flow\nin less quickly. Furthermore, the German company said \u201cLockdowns have\nbeen reintroduced in some regions,\nrecovery is uneven and companies are\nfacing more business uncertainty.\u201d Its\nmid-sized (businesses) clients were, as a\nresult of COVID-19, moving towards\ncloud causing a need to improve on\ntheir services. Christian Klein, one of\nthe two new CEOs of the firm, said \u201cWe\nwill speed up the modernisation of our\ncloud delivery infrastructure,\nthis will require additional investments in 2021 and 2022,\nbut it sets us up for a cloud cost\nmargin of approximately 80\npercent by 2025.\u201d This added\ninvestment into the software\ncombined with the reduced\nrevenues shot down SAP\u2019s\nshare price. However, Jefferies\nanalysts say that the subscription services could make up to\n85% of turnover by 2025; so it\u2019s\nnot all doom and gloom!\nThe reason we dive into SAP SE is that\nit is Europe\u2019s largest software company,\nand the STOXX Europe 600 Technology Index (an analog of NASDAQ for\nEurope) fell 10.5% over the past week.\nLooking at the companies and contributors of a stock index can help us more\neasily understand the movements of the\nindex itself as these trends can often apply to similar companies.\nUS\nAgain looking at technology, the USbased tech heavy NASDAQ index was\ndown 5.5% this week despite the big\ntech companies doing well after revealing their Q3 earnings reports. As I mentioned above, it is important to look at\nthe actual companies which contribute\nto a stock index; 49% of the NASDAQ\n100 is governed\nby Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook,\nAlphabet (AKA\nGoogle), and\nTesla. These\ncompanies have\nbeen through a\nlot over the past\n2 weeks, from growing pains related to\nthe pandemic, to antitrust issues, the\nSection 230 hearing and electoral poli-tics. Despite this, they are booming due\nto the rising market for online advertising and the obvious increase in screen\ntime. \u201cAll of these companies have just\nreturned an absolute killer of a quarter,\u201d\nsaid Youssef Squali, an internet analyst\nat Truist. \u201cThe recovery curve is just a lot\nsharper than any of us expected. Online\nis taking a tonne of market share from\noffline.\u201d\nThe contentious hearing on Wednesday\nwas truly a roller coaster. Roger Wicker,\na Republican senator, opened the hearing by accusing Twitter and the other\nplatforms of \u201cselective censorship...in\nthe midst of the 2020 election cycle\u201d.\n(continued on the next page)\nThis is because a New York Post tweet\nwastakendownasitlookedlikeahacked\ntweet. On the other hand, Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat senator, said\n\u201cI believe the Republicans have called\nthis hearing in order to support a false\nnarrative fabricated by the president to\nhelp his re-election prospects, the tech\ncompanies here today need to take more\naction, not less.\u201d Outside of political de-bate, the hearing served as an evaluation\nof Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that gives tech\nplatforms immunity from being sued\nover user-generated content. Speaking\nto Section 230, Mark Zuckerberg called\non Congress to \u201cupdate the law to make\nsure it\u2019s working as intended\u201d. On the\nother hand Jack Dorsey said that eroding the foundation of Section 230 could\ncollapse how we communicate on the\ninternet, leaving only a small number\nof giant and well-funded technology\ncompanies.\u201d This would be a terrible situation for tech companies worldwide if\nnot dealt with carefully. Furthermore,\nthe hearing could result in additional\npressure on companies to more carefully censor political ads which could have\nan impact on the election.

    "content": "The UK\u2019s latest \u00a355m nuclear\nfusion experiment switched on\nlast Thursday (October 29th) after a\nseven-year build.\nLocated at the Culham Centre for\nFusion Energy in Oxfordshire, the\nMega Ampere Spherical Tokamak\n(MAST) Upgrade is a successor experiment to the original MAST, which\noperated from 1999 to 2013.\nWhat makes MAST Upgrade\nunusual is its shape; while more well-known fusion experiments such as\nFrance\u2019s ITER are tokamaks based on a\ntorus (essentially, a doughnut), MAST\nUpgrade is a spherical tokamak, which\nhas a shape more akin to a cored apple.\nBoth designs operate on the same\nprinciple: confine a super-hot hydrogen plasma in the shape of a torus\nusing strong magnetic fields, sustaining a steady rate of fusion reactions.\nHowever, the \u2018cored apple\u2019 shape of\nthe spherical tokamak is expected\nto give multiple advantages over the\ntorus shape of the traditional tokamak,\nnamely making it more\ncompact and\nable to use\nmagnetic\nfields more\nefficiently.\nThe MAST\nUpgrade\nexperiment\naims to shed\nnew light on\nthe practicality of the spherical tokamak design for\ncompact power plants.\nMAST Upgrade is also the first\nfusion reactor to make use of the \u2018Super-X divertor\u2019, which is a system that\naims to expel spent plasma by cooling\nit more than commonly used exhaust\nsystems. With cooler material going\nthrough the divertor, materials used\non divertor surfaces should be able to\nlast longer before needing replacement.\nThe Culham Centre for Fusion Energy\nbelieve that this system, if shown to\nwork successfully, will be a key design\nfor commercial fusion reactors.\nIn a Government press release,\nScience Minister Amanda Solloway\nlooked forward to the future: \u201cWe\nwant the UK to be a world leader in\nfusion energy and to capitalise on its\namazing potential as a clean energy\nsource that could last for hundreds of\nyears. Backed by \u00a355 million of government funding... [MAST Upgrade]\ntakes us another step closer towards\nour goal of building the\nUK\u2019s first fusion power\nplant by 2040.\u201d\nHowever, the Government\u2019s commitment to\nthe UK being a world\nleader in fusion remains\nin doubt. Despite calls\nfrom scientists for the\nUK to remain part of the\nEuropean Atomic Energy\nCommunity (Euratom),\nthe UK has not yet resolved this in the ongoing\nBrexit negotiations and is\nthus not currently party\nto the ITER programme,\nwhich aims to construct\nthe world\u2019s largest tokam-ak and demonstrate that\nfusion is indeed a viable\nenergy source.\nUK\u2019s latest fusion reactor, MAST\nUpgrade, boots up\n2040\nUK Government target\nfor first fusion\npower plant\nFigure 1: Binding energy per nucleon (MeV) against atomic mass number.\nPicture credits: James Provost/AAAS\nWhat is nuclear\nfusion?\nNuclear fusion is a promising\nenergy source for the future. Where\nnuclear fission splits heavy atoms in\na chain reaction, fusion joins light\natoms together. Both these processes release energy despite being\nopposites to one another: this is\ndue to a quantity called the binding energy per nucleon. A graph of\nthis quantity against atomic mass\ncan be seen in Figure 1. This curve\nshows that it is energetically favourable for lighter elements to fuse\nto become heavier elements, and\nfor very heavy elements to split to\nbecome lighter elements.\nThis is a powerful graph; not\nonly does it show us that fusion releases a lot more energy than fission\nfor the same mass of fuel, it also\nshows that iron is in a sense the\nmost stable nucleus; it is not energetically favourable for it to split\nor fuse. This is why stars can only\nmake elements up to and including\niron.\nFusion requires two nuclei to\novercome their electrostatic repulsion by getting close enough so\nthat the strong force kicks in. This\ninitial repulsion is strong; stars\nmanage to get hydrogen nuclei\nclose due to immense pressure and\ntemperatures at their centres thanks\nto gravity, however these conditions are difficult to replicate on\nEarth without huge inefficiencies.\nDue to these inefficiencies, fusion\nexperiments currently take in more\nenergy than they give back. In\norder for fusion energy to become\na practical source of clean and safe\npower, these inefficiencies must be\nreduced.\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nToroidal tokamaks vs spherical tokamaks: which is the future for fusion?\nPicture credits: OpemStax University Physics\nFRIDAY 6TH NOVEMBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "V\nery few people seem to remember this title,\nwhich I find profoundly bizarre given it\nearned PlayStation Platinum status. A child\u2019s\nedition of Grand Theft Auto, being able to run amok\nin Springfield with Homer Simpson, Bart Simpson\nand other legendary characters of the show at the\nwheel made the game a lifelong child memory. Many\nhours were spent completing challenges as part of the\nextraterrestrial storyline, but the arcade nature and\nrelatively sophisticated graphics for a PS2 title in 2003\nof all years takes me back to my first foray into the\nutopia of video gaming.\n... In FIFA, it\u2019s much the same.\nGamers want the best football\nplayers on their team, whether\nthat be Ronaldo, Neymar, Messi\nor Ben Yedder. The chance of\nsuch outcomes are so slim, you\u2019d\nprobably stand more chance of\nwinning the lottery (but please\ndon\u2019t quote me as fact, it\u2019s just\nhyperbole). The fact is, gamers\nspend hundreds, if not thousands\non attaining such bespoke and\nhighly lucrative items (which to\nmake things worse expire at the end\nof September of the next calendar\nyear after release). An accountant\nwould say you would be mad to\nmake such a foolish expense on\nsuch a short term asset. This isn\u2019t\na game, this is pseudo-gambling\naddiction the way I see it.\nA video game that requires a\nlarger expenditure than simply\npurchasing the disc itself is not\na game but more of a gambling\nmachine. Spend \u00a355 on release day\nfor FIFA and you\u2019d still need to\nspend more than \u00a350 per month on\naverage just to attempt (not even\nguarantee) to get the best players in\nthe game for your squad. It\u2019s purely\ngambling and although other\npeople might stand differently to\nthe view I\u2019ve delivered so far, it is\nnot sustainable for a 13-year-old to\nempty more of his account just to\nearn players that would last him the\nbest part of 12 months.\nAgain, a video game should be\nabout having fun at no more of\nan expense than purchasing the\ntitle itself. If you pay \u00a350 for the\nnew edition then that\u2019s all you\nshould pay to enjoy the experience\nlike everyone else. Take Infinity\nWard\u2019s Modern Warfare and\nWarzone as an example: all the\nguns are accessible, some from the\nstart and others are unlockable by\ncompleting in-game challenges.\nThe only purchases that you are\nfree to make are purely cosmetic\ne.g. new soldier skins, bullet tracers\nthat shoot bullets with rainbow\ncolours or camos for cars. Even\nif you purchase the battle pass,\nwhich for those unfamiliar is like a\nTesco Clubcard that offers rewards\nbased on how much you play (or\nin Tesco\u2019s case, pay) you still earn\nenough points to purchase the next\nbattle pass, so in essence it\u2019s a one\noff purchase for a lifetime of free\ncosmetic assets.\nWhen parliament demanded EA\nto explain why loot-box mechanics\nwere prevalent in FIFA, vicepresident Kerry Hopkins described\nthem as \u201csurprise mechanics\u201d akin\nto \u201cKinder Eggs\u201d. That simply is a\nflawed argument at best \u2014 you\u2019re\nguaranteed chocolate and a toy\nin Kinder Eggs, but in FIFA it\u2019s\nnot even a certainty whether the\nchocolate will be rewarded to you.\nOverall, EA has adopted a\npay-to-win structure, and it\u2019s killing\nthe fun out of a gaming series well\nembedded in modern culture. Pro\nclubs, which is a game mode where\nfriends play together against other\nteams, has simply been disbanded\nand only refined once in the past\n5 iterations. A gamemode where\nthere isn\u2019t a pay-to-win structure\nis simply left to rot with countless\nbugs and glitches while EA are\ncatering to Ultimate team in\nconjunction with the eSports\nscene, where obscene fees are paid\nto obtain the best items in their\nUltimate Team squad. Professional\neSports athletes fight it out with\nthe very best items in the game,\neven after expenditures upwards\nof \u00a310,000 simply to start off\nwith. When I started FIFA 21 the\nother week, I was running with a\n3 star team, whereas my opponent\nalready spent enough money\nin 24 hours to obtain Ronaldo,\nMessi and icon Del Piero. Game\npublishers and eSports deserves\nits own discussion since there\u2019s\ntoo much to discuss regarding the\nmatter in simply one article.\nFIFA needs to change. Their\nmonopoly on the game allows them\nto get away with such pseudo-casino-esque practices. Whilst\nonline names such as Kurt0411\nare trying to raise their voices on\nthe matter, EA take the short road\nand simply ban their accounts\non mention of the matters that\nthey\u2019re being required to answer.\nThe game is encouraging gambling,\nand without intervention, the\nproblem will get much bigger until\nlivelihoods are ruined.\nAfter the time of writing, it was\nreported that EA was fined up to\n\u20ac10 million by the Netherlands\nGaming Authority (KSA) for failing\nto \u201cheed the KSA\u2019s call\u201d to adapt\ntheir games by removing gambling\nelements in their titles.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nGAMES\nGames.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n24\nMY FIRST GAME\nManual defending\nfinally, but bugs live on\nFIFA 21\nReviewed by Ahmad Danesh Games Editor\nCreated by: Electronic Arts Vancouver\nPublishedby:EA Sports\nForfansof:Football, the beautiful game\nLockdown meant that FIFA 20 was one of the top\nsellers, and EA had an opportunity here to fix the\nbugs and requests of die-hard players in the FIFA\ncommunity.

    "content": "Calm With Horses came out earlier this year,\nbut it has now made its way on to Netflix. Set in Ireland, it tells the story of Douglas\n\u2018Arm\u2019 Armstrong: a father to an autistic child\nin a broken home and the loyal enforcer for the\nDevers crime family. As the Dever\u2019s requests of\nArm become more violent, he must pick between his loyalties and decide how to play his\nrotten hand. Cosmo Jarvis brilliantly reflects the\ntwo halves of Arm\u2019s life. While he is constantly\nstruggling to prove himself to the Devers and\nto meet their needs, the people he really tries to\nimpress are his ex-partner and his son. Around\nthem he is thoughtful, witty, delicate, and vulnerable\u2014a stark contrast to his brutishness when\nhe is around Dymphna (one of the young leaders\nof the crime family, played by Barry Keoghan).\nCalm With Horses is both immensely exciting and\nhilariously funny; however, what sticks out most\nis the bond between a father and a son. Arm is\nnot the man his son deserves, and while he knows\nthis all too well, he struggles to break the cycles\nof error that trickle down the generations. In\nhis son\u2019s happiness, and in his isolation, he sees\nhimself and Arm discovers that being a father is\nnot about giving, it is about sacrificing. It is this\ntransformation of personality that makes this\nmovie a great little watch.The depth of the cast\nand the skill of the filmmaking do not let on that\nit is in fact Nick Rowland\u2019s first feature-length\nmovie.\nCalm With Horses is a fabulous 90 minute movie,\nand it\u2019s streaming on Netflix now.\nOn Fatherhood and Family\nNew Movie From An Imperial Filmmaker\nReviews\nMy suspenseful short film\n\u201cDegenerate (RenJianJiE)\u201d tells the story of\nthe butterfly effect\u2014\nwhich links a pyramid\nselling gang leader, a\nfilm director, and a director of a mental hos-pital. It took around 4\nmonths to create, and\ncomes out at around 34\nminutes. It is available\nvia the QR code, I hope that you enjoy it!\nMy name is Yanlin Chen\u2014although people normally call me Philip\u2014and I am a 4th student at Imperial on the Msci Physics course. Directing short\nfilms, as well as screenwriting them, is a major hobby of mine. Although I do not get to film regularly,\nI have kept up the tradition of returning to China\neach year to make my yearly film. This year, because of the COVID-19 situation, I returned home\nearlier than in previous years. The inspiration for\nthis film came to me just after my final exam on\nPlasma Physics in late May. The idea was to combine the \u2018film within a film\u2019 technique with a two-line plot\u2014this technique is novel as far as I know,\nalthough these techniques have been used separately in movies like Memento. The\nmain line of\nthe movie is\nthe positive\norder, following the\npositive time\naxis, and the\ns e c o n d a r y\nline is the\nf l a s h b a c k .\nThese two\nlines intersect at the\nend of the plot. To make a plot one must first have\na structural frame, then one can fill in the content and double-check the story\u2019s logic and character\u2019s motivations. It took about half a month to\nconceive, as well as write a finalized 10,000 word\nscript, for Degenerate. However, all of that was\nonly preliminary work. We encountered many hurdles while filming, from venue coordination to the\ndeployment of temporary personnel. This film is\nlonger than any of my previous works; as such, the\ndifficulties encountered in the filmmaking process\nincreased exponentially, confirming the old saying\nthat \u201cfilm is the art of execution\u201d.\nFortunately, we were able to release this film just\nbefore the start of term. It is a suspenseful story\nwith an almost perfect murder plan (except for\nWen Jiang, the mental patient with a cross-mask).\nWhat I am most proud of is the storyline and the\nfact that the behaviours and motives of the characters have no bugs as far as I\u2019m aware. The film\nreceived some negative feedback at first, but most\nfeedback was based on the audience\u2019s perception\nof the film as a regular-length film rather than a\nmicro-movie\u2014this made me pleased in a way as\nit showed they were still drawn into the story. As\nyou can imagine, making a movie is costly. In my\nfirst few works, except from advertising fees and\nbonuses for award wins, I\nhave not thoroughly considered the issue of fund\nflow. Thus, our focus for\nthe next film is to consider profitability and to include a professional production stage.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nBy Philip Chen\nDirectedby: Nick Rowland\nYearofRelease: 2019\nStarring: CosmoJarvis;BarryKeoghan;Niamh\nAlgar;NedDennehy;DavidWilmot;SimoneKirby\nCalm with Horses\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFILM\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\n14\nDegenerate (RenJianJiE)\nTHE IDEA WAS\nTO COMBINE\nTHE \u2018FILM\nWITHIN A FILM\u2019\nTECHNIQUE\nWITH A TWOLINE PLOT\n\u201c\nScan to watch!\nCredit: DMC Film/Film4 Production/Element Pictures\n\n"

    "content": "rooms they no longer need\u201d, and that\nBristol University overpromised because they \u201cwanted students to come\nback so they could have our accommodation fees\u201d. The Bristol Students\u2019\nUnion has fully supported the strike\nefforts. The main message of the campaign is that the University \u201chas a duty\nof care to its students\u201d that isn\u2019t currently being met.\nPrior to the strike, the campaign\nwith support from Bristol Students\u2019\nUnion brought the issue to the University and did not receive satisfactory re-sponse, prompting the strike. The rent\nstrike campaign officially launched\non October 14th, with things moving\nswiftly and over 1000 students pledging to strike in the following ten days.\nOther demands of the campaign\naddress the shoddy self-isolation conditions that students are placed under.\nThe University has been asked to commit to delivering food packages on\ntime, that food packages cater for all\ndietary requirements, to provide basic\ncleaning and menstrual products, allow outdoor access for students living\nin flats with no positive cases, and regular mental health check-ins from the\nUniversity\u2019s Residential Life Services.\nTransparency on the role and actions\nof security staff have also been asked\nfor.\nThe campaign organisers and student union have also been in contact\nwith staff unions that represent the\ncleaning and maintenance staff in\nhalls, and has included in their demands that the University do not dismiss any staff members as a result of\nthe lost rent revenue.\nRent striking is not an action protected by law, however the campaign\nbelieves that the University will not\ntake disciplinary action or evict its\nown students during a pandemic because of their concern for reputation\nand fear of public backlash. Bristol\nUniversity owns most of the housing\nthat students on strike reside in, although there are also some students\nunder private housing providers, and\nthe campaign has sought eviction resistance support from the community\norganisation ACORN for these stu-dents.\nBristol University says that students\nare being provided with laundry ser-vices, welfare support, and hygiene\nproducts. The University also claims\nthat food is being delivered that caters\nto dietary requirements, in contrast\nto student reports. The University assured that students taking part in the\nstrike will not be sanctioned academ-ically, bursaries and scholarships will\nnot be affected, and international students should not worry about any visa\nissues.\nRent strikes in other universities\naround the country have also been\nplanned. Students at the University of Manchester have also been organizing rent strikes\nsince early October,\nwith \u00a3300,000 being withheld as of\nOctober 13th. Their\ndemands include\nno-penalty contract\nreleases and a 40%\nrent reduction for\nstudents remaining\nin halls.\nStrikes in UoM\nhave been prompted\nby a range of similarly poor conditions for students self-isolating. In late\nSeptember, over 100 students in Weston Hall of UoM were forced to sleep\non the floor in communal spaces after\ntheir flats were flooded, challenging\nsocial distancing efforts. On October\n8th, a 19 year old student was found\ndead in the UoM Fallowfield residence\nhalls, having committed suicide due to\ndeteriorating mental health and severe\nanxiety from lockdown.\nMore recently, on the morning of\nThursday November 5th, students\nliving in UoM Fallowfield campus\nwoke up to find themselves fenced in\nby a chain of metal gates surrounding\nthem completely. The University had\nput up metal fences in an effort to restrict entry and exit to the building to\na single, security-guarded point, and\nno prior notification had been given to students. The fences were torn\ndown by students the same day during a protest held in the evening. The\nUniversity already apologised \u201cfor the\nconcern and distress caused\u201d and had\nplanned to remove the fences the following morning, but students had already taken them down.\nCurrently, 137 students have tested\npositive for Covid-19 in the last two\nweeks, however, these are not necessarily all students in halls and there\nhas yet been no hall-wide lockdown.\nHowever, students in halls that have\nbeen found breaking social distancing\nrules have been fined \u00a350 each, which\nis paid to the hall and as has been\nseen in previous weeks, what occurs\nin northern, badly affected areas of\nBritain is often repeated in the south a\nweek or two later.\nIf you are experiencing any\nmental health\ndifficulties or are\naffected by the\ncontent of this\narticle, you can\nseek free and\nurgent services\nsuch as:\nSamaritans is a\n24/7 hotline that\nis open for, call\n116 123 freely\nwithout any mobile credit, or email jo@samaritans.\norg.

When\nthe student went to investigate there\nwere not boxes. In fact the flat was not\neven being occupied by Imperial College students. It was only after appealing to the halls-wide groupchat that\nthe boxes were identified in a studio.\nStudents have expressed happiness,\nhowever, at the increased quality of\nroom that they had recieved. Rooms\nin the halls they previously occupied\ncosted \u00a3135 a week but the Chapter\nflats given to students cost between\n\u00a3209 and \u00a3279 a week at no additional\ncost to the student themselves.

    "content": "FRIDAY 6TH NOVEMBER 2020\n13\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSo often, when people talk about\nClassical music, many will either zone\nout, or groan. It\u2019s somewhat alien, elitist,\nand many can find it boring. Elitist- yes,\nclassical music has a problem, though\nthis is starting to change over the sum-mer, with some fantastic underrated\ncomposers being discussed in a recent\nBBC4 documentary (along with the\nrest of the arts programmes that\nno longer feature on BBC1\nand 2). Much progress is\nneeded though, as the Vienna\nPhilharmonic rejected what\nwould have been their first\nfemale principle flautist just this\nyear. Alien- that\u2019s what I hope\nto address in this column. The\npeople who teach classical music have it wrong. They start with\nMozart and Beethoven- the largest two\nnames, but often with what can seem to\nyoung people as ancient and,well, bor-ing. I was forcefed classical music from\na young age by a very musical family,\nhowever when it was my turn to listen to\nmusic it was (60s) pop, until the age of\n16. What happened? I listened to more\n20th century classical music, which is\nwhat most young classical musicians prefer anyway (I read about an orchestra\nin Norway, I think, that plays only\n20th century composers and enjoys\na large audience with an average\nage in the 20s).\nMy goal in this column, as a conductor of my own student orchestra,\nwill be to piggyback on the small\nrise in popularity that classical music has had in the recent\nmonths and recommend pieces\nthat people without much exposure to classical can actually enjoy. I\u2019ll\nalso spotlight an underrated composer\neach week with one of their works. I\u2019ll\ntry to keep the pieces I recommend quite\nshort, at least to begin with). I may also\nget some friends (and anyone interested)\nto discuss some of their favourite works\nhere too!\nWhen did you first hear this song?\nI was at my first festival and Jamie XX was headlining.\nThere was a couple making out in front of me, one\npushed me, apologised, and offered to take me on his\nback for the next song. We were close to the stage and\nthere was a light drizzle which only added\nto the insane visuals of rainbow led\nlights.\nHow old were you when you first\nheard this song?\n17\nIn a sentence, describe the song\nPure happiness, it switches off everything else\nIs there a specific lyric you connect with?\n\u201cI go to loud places to search for someone to be quiet\nwith\u201d\nWhat initially drew you to the song?\nThe lyrics were very relevant to a reconnection happening in my life at the time.\nIs there a killer moment?\n3:05 \u2013 after the second chorus, when many elements\nare stripped back, and the song becomes less crowded\nIs there another sense you associate strongly with\nthis song?\nRain, soft rain, like a drizzle\nHow often do you listen to this song?\nNearly every day, I do take breaks, but I listen\nto it especially during the summer\nDo certain situations give you the urge to listen to\nthis song?\nI have moments when I have the urge to be by myself,\nto take a moment outside. I try to only ever listen to it\nwhen I\u2019m already happy/not sad, it\u2019s the perfect thing\nto accompany cherishing a moment.\nAre there specific activities you do to this song?\nI drive a lot of people around. This is a perfect song for\ndriving someone home from a party.\nIs this song one that you share with other people?\nTo me this song is about capturing the best moments,\nwhen I share this song it means that I want to save a\nvery positive memory. Listening to it now reminds me\nof my \u201ccollection of moments\u201d.\nFinal comments?\nIf someone knows Jamie XX\u2019s phone number could\nyou hit me up pls\nBringing Classical Back To The Masses\nPassing the Aux to Gabriela Zibikowska\nFeature\nFeature\nI may as well start with my favourite\npiece of music- and it\u2019s one I played\nto a friend who never liked classical\nmusic, but fell in love with this piece.\nStravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring, originally\na ballet, tells the story of ancient Russian Pagan tribes in their rituals, several dances that culminate in a young\ngirl dancing herself to the death. The\nraw power of this piece has inspired\nmany composers, and indeed many\nrock groups, and legendarily was so\ngroundbreaking for 1913 France that\nit provoked a riot outside the concert\nhall.\nNothing quite comes close to Stravinsky\u2019s own recording in terms of the\nenergy that comes from this piece, so\ncheck out that. I said I\u2019d keep it short\nso listen to part 1, starting with the\nAugurs of spring (about 2 minutes\nin) if you can\u2019t wait for the action to\nstart!\nAnd now for something completely\ndifferent: The early 20th century\nFrench composer Lili Boulanger is\nnot quite as well-known as her sister\nNadia, but is (in my opinion) the\nbetter composer, winning the Prix\nde Rome for her cantata \u201cFaust et\nHelene\u201d. Unfortunately, an early death\naged 24 due to tuberculosis meant\nher works are very limited, but check\nout her psalm 24, which mixes a large\norchestra with medieval chords for\nsomething quite different to the normal \u201ccanon\u201d of Western Classical mu-sic, or her Vielle priere bouddhique,\nwhich is similar to Stravinsky\u2019s style.\nMichael Kohn Music Writer Stravinski - Rite of Spring Lili Boulanger - Psalm 24\nInterview by Guthrie Ruby Music Editor\nJamie XX - Loud Places\nGabi - 3rd year medicine, Bobby - tree with swag\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n16\nBOOKS\nIdon\u2019t know about you, but the only bit of innovation\nI\u2019ve been seeing in recent years are the questionable\nsoftware updates and Instagram icons that constantly\nshell my phone, which I try to ignore; until of course\nthe notifications become physically unbearable \u2013 and\ndon\u2019t get me started on TikToks. It\u2019s pathetic. This then\nled me to ponder on Huebner\u2019s famous quote \u2013 \u201cinnovation is a finite resource.\u201d\nSo, is this it for mankind? Will our sci-fi fantasies\nof travelling space with fellow aliens only be just that,\na fantasy; or is there someone out there, crazy enough\nto make this a reality. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Elon\nReeve Musk.\nElon Musk is well known for his quixotic business\nventures, which include but are not limited to: Tesla,\nSpaceX and SolarCity. Vance\u2019s portrayal of\nMusk has been accused\nof being\nBorderline hagiog-raphic, which is true in\nsome respects; howev-er, that comment alone\nsignificantly discredits\nhow well put together the book is, and the\nchallenge of writing about a character such as Musk.\nSome also may argue that the book is more a biography of Tesla and SpaceX, which is also true; however,\none can view these intentions differently. We see that\nTesla and SpaceX, as companies, describe Elon Musk\u2019s\ncharacter and ideals almost entirely. They embody him.\nThey represent forward thinking, innovation, risk,\ntechnology and the future. Thus, based on Vance\u2019s de-piction, and to suit the occasion, I thought I\u2019d give innovation and forward thinking a go and list four ways\nin which you can be like Elon Reeve Musk in this qua-si-book review.\nPlay against the odds\nMusk entered two industries that were once impractical and very high risk \u2013 electric cars and rockets. At\na time where you were better off walking than driving an electric powered car, it seemed as though this\ntechnology hit a dead end in its application in vehi-cles. However, Musk played against the odds and soon\nwon big. Tesla didn\u2019t invent the electric car but undeniably reinvented it. The same goes for his ventures in\nSpaceX, where a start-up rocket company was unheard\nof. Musk\u2019s tenacity and belief that space travel could\nbecomemuchcheaperresultedinhimonceagain,rein-venting a once static industry dominated by large com-panies. Although this sounds awe-inspiring, Vance\u2019s\nvivid descriptions of Elon\u2019s mental state, failures and\nnear bankruptcy just makes it clear that play against\nthe odds will require one to handle the large potential\nfailures. Musk proved that. \u201cHe is just different than\nthe rest of us.\u201d\nWork like hell (expect everyone to do the same)\nMusk spends every working hour of his time working between his two main companies, and he expects\neveryone to do the same. With the great task of making\nhumans multiplanetary species, it is understandable to\nsee why Musk is always thinking at 100mph, going as\nfar as to spending his visits to the bathroom like formula 1 pitstops. He\u2019s restless, hungry and expects his\nemployees to share the same mentality. Vance often\ndepicts Elon as ruthless and quite comical, including a time where Musk let one loose on an employee\nwho missed a company event to witness his baby being\nborn. Musk was in genuine rage that the fellow employee didn\u2019t have his \u2018priorities in check.\u2019 As absurd as\nit sounds, Vance tries to\ngrasp and empathise with\nMusk\u2019s personality. The\ncase that, \u2018\u2026he does not\ndislike them as people\u2026\u2019\nthey\u2019re just \u2018getting in the\nway\u2019 and do not see the\nurgency of Musk\u2019s vision.\nVision\nMusk\u2019s ridiculous\nwork ethic can be explained by his vision and his approach to make this\nvision come to fruition; be it replacing petrol cars,\nmaking space travel cheaper or moving to Mars.\nThese ideas may seem quixotic, however Vance\u2019s\ndepiction of Musk\u2019s outlandish obsession with these\ntechnologies from a very young age make sense of,\nand makes you believe that maybe Musk\u2019s plan for\nMars will actually work, no matter how absurd they\nmay sound.\nAn appetite for knowledge\nRunning a rocket company and an electric car\ncompany on the side requires an amazing mind,\nand Musk\u2019s appetite and ability to absorb information has often been described as being amazing to\nwitness by mere mortals. An example Vance uses\nis Musk being engrossed by an old, tattered Soviet\nrocket manual when he was starting out at SpaceX.\nThe fact that he had no underlying knowledge of\nrockets didn\u2019t stop Musk. Musk truly believes that\nany problem, no matter how complicated, can be\nbrought down to the pure fundamentals, and that\u2019s\nexactly what he did when thinking of what it takes\nto build a rocket. He started with the raw material\ncosts of building a rocket and realised that rockets\nwere just too overpriced and needlessly superfluous.\nHe saw a new market. It also subtly highlights the\nfact that Musk takes the initiative.

Cities need\ntheir citizens as much as citizens\nneed their cities. The only way forward\nis together. With over 100 Climathons\nhappening on six continents,\nthousands of people are taking\nactions across cultures and\ncountries. As our community of\ncitizens, governments, and businesses grows, we see that local\nclimate action is truly trans-formative. People like you are\ngiving rise to a wave of change,\na wave of creativity, and a wave\nof hope. Hope that is fiercely\nrooted in actions.\u201d\nThis quotation is from the\nClimathon 2019 Promo Video.\nBuzz words pump the adrena-line, make me feel excited about\nthis mission. We are taking a\nglobal and urgent problem and\ntrying to solve it from the ground up\nwith everyone\u2019s contribution. Yes, everyone plays a part in this, including an undergraduate student living in a foreign\ncountry like myself, or a Felix reader like\nyourself.\nIbelieveinthepowerofcollaboration\nand providing people with the platform\nto do so.\nIn 2019, a couple of undergrad students and I came together and organised two impact-focused Hackathons\nto encourage students to tackle social\nissues, fuelled by the belief that Imperial students have the skills to do good in\nthis world. We invited mentors, organised workshops, and supported social\nventures for international competitions.\nTransitioning the knowledge about setting up hackathons into a Climathon\nwas a very welcomed challenge that fit\nlike a glove.\nWe knew that organising such an\nevent has its challenges: How do we create a way for ideas and projects to con-tinueaftertheevent?Howcanweensure\ndiversity so that the climate discussions\nare not an echo\nchamber between the same group of\npeople? How can we engage different\nstakeholders when their priorities were\nnot this during the Covid pandemic?\nThese were the questions we had to address since the preparation started in\nApril.\nSeven months later and countless\noverrun meetings, three main things\nwere in place. Firstly, a strong organising\nteam with passionate students and professionals from Imperial College, Impact Hub, and Terra Institute. Secondly,\nlocal problem statements set by local\ncouncils and social enterprises\nwho understand the pain the\nbest. These partnerships will enable participants to brainstorm\nsolutions for real problems, with\nthe possibility of continuing the\nproject post-Climathon. Lastly,\nthanks to Covid, we could cut\non catering costs and eliminate\nthe frustration of sorting pizza\ndelivery logistics.\nAnd here we are now, counting down to the event. So\u2026 why\ndon\u2019t you join us on the weekend of 13th to the 15th of November? Meet some cool people,\nsolve some problems, and play\nyour part in the climate initiative!\nProblem themes: Sustainable Living,\nFood System, Urban Development, and\nSupply chain.\nSign up at:\nhttps://bit.ly/LC2020tickets\nWhy is climate change a social justice issue?\nThis topic isn\u2019t news to anyone interested in worldwide justice issues,\nbut this question seems to get on the\nnerves of climate change deniers, so I\nfeel like we should address it.\nWhen we conceptualise the climate\ncrisis in the Global North, we primarily see the effects of climate change as\nenvironmental. Still, since we, the peo-ple, and the environment are inextricably connected, the impacts of climate\nchange are also social and economic.\nMore frequent extreme weather events\nand climate changes affect the local agricultural production, safe water access,\nproductivity, and end up forcing people\nto migrate to other regions and sometimes other countries.\nThe consequences of climate change,\nsuchasflooding,risingsealevel,drought\nand increased temperature, are disproportionately affecting low-income countries and poor people in high-income\ncountries. People who can move away\nfrom at-risk areas are already moving,\nbut those who cannot afford too are left\nbut eventually\nare forced to\nmove and can\nbe put into an\nunstable living situation.\nBy the end of\nthe century,\nwe expect that\nmore than\n180 million\npeople will\nbe displaced\ndue to climate\nchange.\nF u r t h e r -more, the climate crisis will disproportionately affect people of colour, as more\npeople of colour live in areas vulnerable\ntoenvironmentaldegradation(asaresult\nof climate change). This is in addition to\nthe effects of environmental racism from\npolluting systems and corporations.\nSo, what can we do? We can reject\nthis destruction of the planet as the\nnorm. The status quo serves to displace\npeople and creates significant uncertainties already in countries in the Global\nSouth. We in the Global North haven\u2019t\nfelt the same level of effects as the south,\nbut we continue to uphold the systems\nof oppression that create the problems.\nSupport climate justice now by joining\nyour local community action group. No\nmovement or community network is\ntoo small.\nSome examples of climate actions\nthat you can take are: Switching to renewable energy, improving the energy\nefficiency of your house, swap to a cli-mate-friendly bank, eating a plant-rich\ndiet and reducing food waste.\nVanessa Tang Sustainability Writer\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\n\n"

    "content": "While many of us were trying to enjoy Halloween\nunder the constraints of regional restrictions,\nthe news of a second lockdown unexpectedly entered\nthe celebrations. For me, it was if the party had been\ngatecrashed by an unwanted guest. If that guest was\nalmost three-hours late, and they were called Boris\nJohnson of course. Because on Saturday 31st October,\nhe officially announced new lockdown measures for\nEngland.\nFrom Thursday 5th of October, England will be in\nlockdown until Wednesday 2nd December, but there\ncould be extensions of the lockdown come 2nd December. Overall, the new restrictions will mean that\npeople will need to stay at home unless they; have medical concerns, are shopping for basic necessities, cannot\nwork from home, need childcare or education and other specific scenarios. People will not be allowed to mix\nindoors with friends or family from separate house-holds, except for support bubbles. A support bubble\ncan only be formed between a single-adult household\nand another household of any size, as defined by the\nDepartment of Health and Social Care. However, it\nis possible to meet with one person from outside your\nhousehold when in outdoor public places. Also, certain businesses will be closed, or face restrictions on\nthe services they can provide. Universities, colleges and\nschools will remain open.\nGiventhethreatofadeathtollthatexceedstheworst\ncase scenarios, I can see how the decision was inevita-ble. In fact, I wasn\u2019t particularly surprised when I heard\nthe announcement; for the past few weeks I have been\nanticipating a spark, something that would remind us\nthat we are still living through a pandemic. While other students around me seemed to be trying to build a\nbubble of normalcy around them, I was waiting for the\nbubble to pop.\nPressure had been mounting for stricter actions for a\nwhile, but last week in Felix it was argued by Imperial\nstudent Marwan Riach that further lockdowns are not\nthe best approach. Admittedly, at the start of the pan-demic, I was confused at the hesitation to enter a lock-down. However, as the lockdown continued, I became\nmoreawareofthedifficultiescausedbytherestrictions.\nIn the article, Riach addressed issues with vaccine pro-duction, mental health, furlough and unemployment.\nConcerns I think are valid and widely shared, so I can\nunderstand the reluctance. The new lockdown restrictions aim to save lives, but this approach will not be a\nstrictly positive change for all members of our society.\nI personally support the lockdown, but I also understand that it is not the perfect solution. This lockdown\nwill impact different sections of society differently.\nEven though it aims to protect everyone from COVID-19, it seems the blanket lockdown approach will\nnot accommodate everyone.\nClearly, there are other Imperial students who did\nnot want a second lockdown. By now, this should be\napparent to anyone who follows Imperial Secrets. So,\nI was curious to know what other students thought\nabout the decision. Therefore, I created a survey, to\nwhich 47 people responded. I asked 9 questions, and\nthe results have been compiled below. The sample size\nis clearly too small to be representative of all Imperial\nstudents, but I found that the honest written responses\npresented a valuable awareness into the consequences\nthe lockdown will have for some students.\nQ1. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE DECISION\nTO IMPOSE A SECOND NATIONAL LOCKDOWN?\nThe majority of respondents agreed with the deci-sion, but just over a quarter did not. Despite the division presented, in later questions it became apparent\nthat most respondents shared the same feelings of\nfrustration.\nQ2. DO YOU THINK THE SECOND LOCKDOWN WILL BE EFFECTIVE?\nThe spike for \u2018probably yes\u2019 is clear, but so is the\nfact that 23.4% of respondents were uncertain about\nthe effectiveness. Followed by the 21.28% who selected \u2018probably not\u2019. These responses pointed to a lack\nof optimism that was present across all the following\nquestions.\nQ3. DID YOU EXPECT A SECOND NATIONAL LOCKDOWN IN ENGLAND OVER\nWINTERTIME?\nIt seems that the news didn\u2019t catch too many by sur-prise.\nQ4. SHOULD UNIVERSITIES STAY OPEN\nDURING THIS LOCKDOWN?\nOver half of respondents agreed with the current\ndecision by the government to keep universities open.\nJust over a quarter disagreed, with the rest stating they\n\u2018had no opinion\u2019. Maybe the desire to remain open is\nout of concern for the potential disruption to educa-tion, or maybe some want to cling onto the little social\nlife they still have.\nQ5. HOW DID THE NEWS OF A SECOND\nLOCKDOWN MAKE YOU FEEL?\nStudentopinionsonLockdown2.0\nPerhaps an expected and inevitable move, but the decision to enforce another lockdown is not being welcomed with open arms\nKhamaGunde\nCommentEditor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nCOMMENT\n\n"

I am\nquite lucky to have\nknown him from\nthe beginning of my\ntime here at univer-sity. I, along with\nmany mechanical\nengineering students\nin the years directly\nabove and below me, owe a significant\npart of our degree success to this man.\nHe spends uncountably numerous hours\ndedicated to running tutorials, creating\ntutorial sheet solutions and answering\nquestions from students. On top of this\nhehasalsoDJ\u2019edatmajorLondonclubs,\nextensively fundraised for charities and\nput a smile onto the face of many of us\nwho see him roller blade into university.\nI share this information so that you can\nfully grasp the nature of Zhengli and the\nlove that is felt towards him in the Mechanical Engineering Department and\nthroughout the university.\nWho are you?\nOriginally from Malaysia, I accepted\nan offer to move to a Singapore at the\nage of 12 for my studies. I went alone,\nand while it was difficult being away\nfrom family at first, I soon grew to enjoy the freedom to\nlive independent-ly. I didn\u2019t do\nany competitive\nsports, but I did\nhave a lot of energy which I expended by running up and down\nthe stairs between\nclasses.\nWhat\u2019s your\nuniversity academic background?\nI did my undergrad here in Mechanical with Nuclear Engineering which I\nquite enjoyed. It was tough, and I kept a\nrecord of study notes that I shared with\nmy friends who were also struggling at\nthe time. Together we created an independent group called Mechnet which\nencourages a culture of collaboration\nbetween students so we can get through\nthe degree, to great success! I have chosen to stay on as a PhD student in the\nsame department and I\u2019m now in my\nsecond year, studying Thermoacoustics.\nWhat\u2019s your sport background?\nI don\u2019t have a background in competitive sports. However, I am naturally attuned for endurance activities due to my\nlow weight and do random sports for\nthe fun of it. I used to run cross-country\nwhen I was very young, and then tried\nout gymnastics, swimming, ice skating,\nroller blading, skiing, cycling, football,\nbadminton, table tennis and climbing. I\nwanted to try out multiple activities to\nsee if there was one that I could stick to.\nI guess I found mine!\nHow did you come across the idea\nof starting ribbon?\nA part of my personality is chaotic en-ergy, so I\u2019m not joking when I say that\nI stumbled upon it randomly because I\nthought it would be funny to try. Last\nNovember, my latest hobby was dancing\nto electronic music. Then the idea came\nto me that instead of just\np u n c h i n g\nthe air with\nmy bare fists\nI could also\nhold a ribbon at the\nsame time.\nMy activity\nis an odd fusion which\ndraws from\nthe elements\nof Rhythmic\nGymnastics, Dance, DJ and Martial\nArts (see \u2018chaotic energy\u2019 above). I don\u2019t\nfollow any instructions on this; I do exactly what I feel like doing at any given\ntime. When you make an activity your\nown, the only standards to adhere to are\nyours!!\nHow do you get the confidence to\ndo what you do in front of strangers\nand some people you do know?\nConfidence doesn\u2019t really drive me;\ngratitude does. Truth is, I almost didn\u2019t\nget my PhD offer and I wouldn\u2019t be\nhere in London right now. I thoroughly enjoyed my undergrad here and all\nthe friends I made in this city. So much\nthat I was visibly shaken when people I\nknew were getting their offers and I was\nresigned to the idea that I wouldn\u2019t be\nstaying here any longer. But a mere two\ndays before I had to leave the country,\nthe offer came!! I was so happy I ran out\nand started dancing on the street and\nclearly haven\u2019t stopped. I guess it\u2019s only\nwhen one faces the real threat of losing\nwhat they have that they understand\nwhat truly matters and what ultimately\ndoesn\u2019t.\nHow has COVID affected your\nlife?\nI intentionally refused to return home\nfor the summer even though my family\nrequested me to (since London\u2019s cases\nwere rising exponentially at the time).\nThis was for their own good, and I still\nmake a firm rule that I refuse to meet\nanyone over the age of 40 without PPE.\nMy ribbon activities though are entirely\nunaffected. When you think about it,\nit\u2019s the perfect social distancing sport! I spent the\nsix months of isolation\npracticing in Hyde Park,\nand appeared randomly on the front page of\nThe Times for it. I made\nfriends with many kids,\nseveral doggos and a swan\nthat took my ribbon for\na swim in the lake. I had\nto chase that swan for\nfour hours while calling\nwildlife services. Let\u2019s just\nsay that I\u2019ve had many\nstrange encounters in these odd times;\nhalf of them involving birds.\nWhat is the music you listen to\nwhile you do it?\nI listen to a mix of Pop and Electronic\nDance Music. My favourites though are\nmashups that I create myself with music\nproduction software. If you have seen\nme performing as a DJ, you would know\nwhat I\u2019m talking about!\nInterview with Zhengli Lim, aka \u2018Ribbon Guy\u2019\nCredits: Aleksander Ziolkowski @ alekziol.com\nZhengli doing what he does best, putting smiles on the fcaes of anyone around Queens tower\nKonrad Hohendorf Sport Editor\nI HAD TO CHASE\nTHE SWAN FOR\nFOUR HOURS\nWHILE CALLING\nWILDLIFE\nSERVICES\n\u201c\nI WAS SO HAPPY\nI RAN OUT AND\nSTARTEDDANCING\nON THE STREET\nAND CLEARLY\nHAVEN\u2019T STOPPED\n\u201c\nI hope you enjoyed this interview as much as I did.

    "content": "The 2020 US Presidential Election was\ntoo close to call on the night, and will\nbe confirmed in the coming days as the\nfinal mail-in votes are counted and final-ised. It has been a strange four years for\nscience in the U.S, and many scientists\nwould rejoice at a win for Biden, but\nwould that really be a win for science?\nAt the start of October, the prominent\nU.S. journal Scientific American released\nan article from \u201cthe editors\u201d, endorsing Joe Biden for president. This was a\njaw-dropping thing for an independent\nscientific journal to do, and Scientific\nAmerican had never in their 175-year\nhistory endorsed a presidential candi-date. The article set out several reasons\nwhy Biden is \u201cguided by the science\u201d,\nciting his policies on climate change\nand public health, and accused Trump\nof \u201crejecting evidence and science\u201d.\nSimilarly, The New England Journal of\nMedicine broke with 208 years of tradition and condemned Trump and his\nresponse to the global pandemic.\nIt certainly appears true that Trump\u2019s\napproach to the pandemic has not been\nled by scientific advisers. On the same\nday that the WHO declared coronavirus\nto be a global health emergency, Trump\ntold a crowd in Michigan that it was\n\u201cunder control\u201d. At a rally in February,\nhe referred to the virus as the Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d. And he regularly\nspread misinformation about untested\ntreatments for the virus, including disinfectant and hydroxychloroquine. His\nconsistent refusal to wear a mask, and\nmocking of those who do, suggested a\ncomplete disregard for the many scientists who support their use as a preventative measure.\nSo is Biden\u2019s track record any better?\nHis policies and general rhetoric do\nseem to favour a scientific approach to\ndealing with the virus. He has publicly\nnamed the leading scientists who are\nadvising him, all of whom are respected\nin their fields (such as the epidemiolo-gist, paediatrician and FDA chief David\nKessler), while Trump prefers to appoint\nexperts in industry and business as his\nadvisers. Biden has promised that he will\nhold daily briefings that \u201cput scientists\nand public health leaders front and\ncenter\u201d and has pledged to rejoin the\nWHO.\nBut it is easy to present an optimistic\nrecovery plan when you are running\nfor president. It is less easy to put it\ninto action once you get to the White\nHouse. Biden would be inheriting a\nchaotic pandemic response from the\nincumbent president, which he would\nhave to rapidly turn around if he wants\nto bring the fast-moving pandemic under control. He would also be inheriting\na lot of public mistrust of national and\ninternational health authorities, such\nas the FDA and the WHO, as well as a\npoliticisation of the pandemic that will\nbe hard to undo.\nEnvironmental and climate change\npolicy will be similarly difficult to deal\nwith. In his first few months as presi-dent, Trump signed an order directing\nthe Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) to repeal limits on carbon emissions from power plants that had been\nset under the Obama administration. A\nfew months later, he withdrew the U.S.\nfrom the 2015 Paris climate accord. He\nlater removed key scientists from advisory committees in the EPA and replaced\nthem with industry representatives.\nBiden has a lot of work to do to re-es-tablish the U.S. international position in\ntackling climate change, and to undo the\nheavily pro-fossil fuel policies that have\nbeen pushed by Trump. He has pledged\n$2 trillion to tackle climate change \u2013 the\nmost ever pledged by a presidential candidate on this issue. He aims to develop\nthe renewable energy industry and in\ndoing so, create millions of new jobs.\nThese plans are, however, incredibly\nambitious. Biden will need to get this\namount of spending approved by Congress, which could prove very difficult\ngiven the closeness of the election.\nIt is clear that Biden has run on a platform that is backed by science and scien-tists, and Trump has opted for economy\nand industry led politics. If Biden does\nget into the White House in January, he\nhas a lot to do to rebuild relationships\nwith scientists and restore public faith in\nscience. The next four years could tell us\nwhether he is the man to do that.\nWhat the US Election Result Means for Science\nLily Shepherd Science Editor\nIn order to put an end to the global coronavirus pandemic, researchers\naround the world are working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to protect\nagainst COVID-19. While vaccine\nproduction usually takes multiple\nyears, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped\ntobedevelopedwithin12-18months.\nVaccine testing can be split into 5\nstages:\nPre-clinical \u2013 animal testing to see\nwhether the vaccine elicits an immune\nresponse.\nPhase I \u2013 healthy human volunteers\nto determine safety and evaluate immune response.\nPhase II \u2013 hundreds of volunteers to\nidentify correct dosage.\nPhase III \u2013 thousands of volunteers\ntoconfirmsafetyandefficacyvs.apla-cebo.\nPhase IV \u2013 studies on adverse effects,\nlong-termmmunityandvaccineusage\nfollowing the approval and licensing\nof the vaccine.\nThe WHO is currently tracking the\nprogress of over 170 candidate vac-cines; at Felix, we\u2019ve chosen 5 of the\nmost promising candidates to follow,\nso watch this space!\nNew Update: This week, while there\nare no certain announcements, the\nNHS has instructed GPs to prepare\nfor the beginning of a vaccine rollout\nin December - should one be available\n- to front-line workers and over-80s.\nCOVID-19 VACCINE TRACKER: Felix Edition\nJulia Dabrowska Science Editor\nBIDEN WOULD\nBE INHERITING\nA CHAOTIC\nPANDEMIC\nRESPONSE\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 6TH NOVEMBER 2020\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"
