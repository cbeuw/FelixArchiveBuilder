This\nballet is the first reunion of the whole Company of\nthe Royal Ballet and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House after a seven months break brought upon by\nthe pandemic.

There is no expense spared, and the subtle aspects that make up the\nballet, such as the omnipresent lighting, stage design,\nand coordination are as good as ever. The lockdown\nand furlough don\u2019t seem to have fazed the artists much.\nThemovementsareconfidentandprecise,thechoreographies brilliant and engaging.\nNatalina Osipova particularly shines as Medusa,\nbut again it is tough to pick favourites in such a celebrated line-up. Each performance by itself would be\nreason enough during normal times. The assorted performances and highlights serve as a taster for ballet, offering snippets of some of the most well-known pieces,\nbrought forth by a company that shows no sign of lockdown fatigue, and is at the top of their craft.\nNevertheless, I won\u2019t lie. It doesn\u2019t entirely recreate the experience of physically witnessing a ballet. A\nballet is not just watching people dancing gracefully\nto the rhythm of an orchestra. The experience is more\nnuanced - It is also catching glances of the decoration\nof the theatre, and slowly have our eyes and minds accustom to the dimmed lights and backdrop, without\nthe distractions of modern-day technology, and finally\nfinding coherence with the reactions of a live audience\nto the performance.

For\nexample, in 2019, the Department of\nJustice of the USA announced that\ntrans and gender non-conforming\nworkers were not to be protected by\ncivil rights law.\nThis book explains the injustices and experiences of being gender\nnon-conforming and why we need\nto go beyond the binary to have justice and safety for all. I highly recommend this book to everyone no matter your interests; For some, it may be\neducation, and for others, it may be\nrecognition as the author writes, \u2018this\nbook is dedicated to everyone who\nhas ever been made to feel like they\nwere too much or never enough\u2019. It is\npart of a series by the Pocket Change\nCollective to spotlight activists, published by Penguin.\nFRIDAY 23RD OCTOBER 2020\nSUSTAINABILITY\n30\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nDuring the summer of 2019, there\nwas a surge of outrage and concern for the fires raging in the Amazon, in which 1 million hectares of\nforest were burned. There was unprecedented media coverage on the\nissue and social media shares skyrocketed like never before. And for\ngood reason. From the period of January to August (2019) there was a 39%\nincrease in forest loss than the same\nperiod in 2018. This increase was\nlikely due to the policy changes President Jair Bolsonaro brought in when\nhe came to office at the beginning of\n2019 (this is the man who has been\nquoted saying, \u2018Let\u2019s use the riches\nthat God gave us for the well-being of\nour population\u2019 on a visit to the Amazon for a mining project).\nThe social media mania brought\nwith it a flux of publicly accessible\nenvironmental education and awareness on Amazonian issues that environmentalists and local communities\nhad been talking about for decades.\nHundreds of celebrities with large\nfollowings urged people to donate to\nNGOs supporting the\nrelief effort, and International leaders offered\na relief fund to Brazil of\n$22.2 million, expressing global concern.\nBut where did our\nconcern go? Considering the lack of rage and\nconcern this, one may\nassume that the Amazon is ok now, and the\nfires all went out...\nWell, the Amazon is\nstill burning, and this\nyear could be worse than the last. Understandably, this year we have been\npreoccupied with other things such\nas the global pandemic and the civil rights movement which started in\nthe USA over the summer. But the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has hit Indigenous communities hard. And this\nyear could be more damaging and\ndestructive than the fires of 2019.\nDeforestation increased by 51%\nin the first three months of this year\ncompared to last year, soil is drier,\nand the temperatures are hotter. To\nunderstand why this is worrying we\nneed to know how the fires occur in\nthe first place.\nFires are not a natural occurrence in the Amazonian ecosys-tems. Most fires are caused by\nhuman burning of the remains\nof deforested areas; shown by\nthe satellite images of fire hotspots being located next to agricul-ture, pasture, and roads. Of the area\nthat was burned in 2019, two thirds\nwere recently deforested (in the last\nfew months). More often than not,\nland grabbers deforest public lands\nto transform it for commercial pur-poses. Therefore, the focus of policy\nchange should be on minimising deforestation to prevent further transformation of more land into agriculture in the Amazon.\nSo, the combination of increased\ndeforestation, drought, and increased\ntemperatures create the conditions\nfor more fires, especially from the beginning of the dry season in May.\nIn June this year, there were 19.6%\nmore fires in the Brazilian Amazon\nthan compared to last year, according the Professor Marcia Castro of\nHarvard University. Additionally, the\nnumbers of fires have increased in\nVenezuela, Colombia, and Peru compared to last year.\nIt is crucial to highlight here that\nwhen forest is burned and transformed in this way, it may never fully\nrecover. Since July there has been a\n\u2018ban on forest fires\u2019 in Brazil, yet there\nis a lack of enforcement and fires continue to burn.\nThis is terrifying. And for the Indigenous communities of the Amazon and areas around it, this is\ntrauma; more specifically Solastalgia\n(anxiety and sorrow from the changes in the natural environment). Indigenous people are most affected by\nthe deforestation and fires of the Amazon. For many groups, the forest is\ntheir livelihood and their home; fires\nand deforestation threaten this. The\nair pollution created by fires is also\ncausing a spike in respiratory prob-lems, with smoke poisoning becoming more and more common across\nAmazonia.\nThe Amazon is a huge carbon sink,\nbut it could become a carbon \u2018faucet\u2019.\nIt is our responsibility to reduce harm\nand further exploitation of the people\nand the ecosystems. We must stand\nin solidarity with the Indigenous people fighting\nfor their lands and we can\nsupport them through organisations such as Amazon Frontlines. Plus, we\ncannot rest on our laurels\nand depend on the Amazon to be the \u2018lungs of the\nearth\u2019. We have the duty to\nincrease our carbon sink\npotential in the UK if we\nhave any chance of preventing further temperature rise across the world.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nA Quick Read\nBy Flora Dickie\nInspiration of\nthe week\n51%\nincrease recorded in\ndeforestation in the\nfirst 3 months of 2020\ncompared to 2019\nCredit: Pixabay\n\n"

The \u201cCollege\nCOVID-19 status and response\u201d webpage\ndisplays the number of recorded positive\ntests on campus in both the past day and\nfortnight, as well as general guidance from\nboth the Government and Faculty. At the\ntime of writing the cumulative total for the\npast 2 weeks was at\nmost 39, with the majority of those students\nand a quarter reported in the last day. Of\ncourse, these statistics\nonly take into account\nthe tests reported to\nthe College\u2019s contact\ntracing hub, and so the true number may\nbe far higher. A particular worry has been\nthat the spread may be worse in halls of\nresidence following multiple outbreaks in\nthem up and down the country, most notably (for Imperial) at the RCM.\nIn order to gauge the veracity of these\nfears, we spoke to some of the residents.\nA hall senior in Eastside told us that she\nwas \u201caware of one positive case\u201d on her\nfloor - as a result of which the floor is now\nself-isolating - but that it was asympto-matic, and was only discovered because of\nher \u201cheavy encouragement\u201d to freshers to\nvisit the Imperial clinic regardless of how\nthey felt. She also expressed the worry that\nsuch encouragement was lacking from\nother seniors and feels that \u201cCollege rules\nfor living in halls aren\u2019t strict enough to\nprevent an outbreak\u201d. On the other hand,\na senior in Kemp Porter said that while a\nfew floors were currently self-isolating,\nthings seemed OK otherwise, although the\nfreshers were \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the rules.\nEveryone we spoke\nto also confirmed\nthat despite some\nresidents socialising\nand partying outside\nthe allowed bounds,\nthe majority seems\nto be adhering to the\nrestrictions.\nThe College is\nseemingly aware that\na more targeted approach to managing outbreaks in halls may be useful. Last week, a\npilot scheme of voluntary testing at Evelyn\nGardens was run with the express purpose\nof \u201cestimating the prevalence of asympto-matic cases\u201d in students and staff on cam-pus.

Their captain, Michael Kohn was\nthe driving force of the team, answering\nquestions correctly on topics as disparate\nas Russian literature, German philosophers and ABBA.

The\nagreement also contains longer-term\nplans for exploration of Mars.\nProject Artemis is aptly named after\nthe Greek goddess Artemis, twin sister\nof Apollo and goddess of the Moon. The\nApollo programme sent the first man to\nthe moon in 1969, and the Artemis programme similarly plans to send the first\nwoman to the moon by 2024 (along\nwith the next man). The programme\nwas authorised in 2017, when President\nDonald Trump signed the Space Policy\nDirective 1.\nThe plans for Project Artemis are\nbroken down into three stages. The first\nphase, Artemis-I, will be an unmanned\ntest flight around the moon in autumn\n2021. The second, Artemis-II, will\nrepeat this trip with a crew onboard\nin 2023. Finally, Artemis-III will land\nLily Shepherd Science Writer\nEuropean Space Agency gets on board\nwith NASA\u2019s exploration of the moon\nThe ESA has announced almost \u20ac3 billion of investment into \u201cthe robotic and human exploration of the Solar System\u201d\nOn Tuesday evening at 23:12 BST,\nNASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx probe\nmade brief contact with the near-Earth\nasteroid Bennu to successfully collect a\nsample of rocks and dust for study upon\nits return to Earth.\nLaunched in 2016, OSIRIS-REx\nreached Bennu in late 2018 and has\nspent the last couple years orbiting and\nsurveying the 490m diameter asteroid.\nThe probe identified suitable sampling\nsites that would cause the least difficulty for the probe, while also providing\na sample rich with information for\nscientists to study. Four of these were\nidentified and named, with sample site\nNightingale being designated the primary site and the one that the probe made\ncontact with this week.\nUsing a 3.3-metre-long arm, the\nprobe released a burst of pressured nitrogen gas to kick up and capture loose\nregolith at the sample site. Nitrogen\nwas chosen as it is relatively inert and\nthus unlikely to react with and affect the\nsample. Currently, the exact details of\nthe sample are yet to be communicated\nto the researchers, however they hope\nthat around 60g of material was scooped\nup. If substantially less material was col-lected, the probe will be sent to backup\nsite Osprey in a few months\u2019 time in\norder to collect more material.\nIt is hoped that the sample will reveal\nthe story of the infant Solar System;\nmany asteroids are remnants from the\nplanet formation phase and could reveal\na great amount of information about\nthe formation of our own planet. They\ncould also enlighten us about the origin\nof life; organic molecules such as amino\nacids, the building blocks of proteins,\nhave been found in meteorite samples\nfrom Earth. However, meteorites that\ncrash onto our planet are subject to extreme temperatures as well as additional\nreactions with gases in our atmosphere,\nso a sample taken directly from an asteroid may be able to shed more light on\nthe answers we are looking for.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that humanity\nhas managed to scoop up an asteroid\nsample for return to Earth; Japan\u2019s\nAerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)\nbeat NASA to it by a year. Hayabusa2 launched in 2014 and last year it\ngrabbed a sample of a different near-Earth asteroid, Ryugu. It is scheduled to\narrive back on Earth at the end of this\nyear, meaning there is not long left until\nscientists can study a pristine asteroid\nsample.\nOSIRIS-REx, meanwhile, is scheduled to depart Bennu\u2019s orbit in March\n2021 and will return with its sample in\n2023. After Tuesday\u2019s successful sam-pling, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said \u201cwe are on the way to returning the largest sample brought home\nfrom space since Apollo. If all goes well,\nthis sample will be studied by scientists\nfor generations to come.\u201d\nAn additional objective of this\nmission is to study the Yarkovsky effect\non Bennu. The Yarkovsky effect is the\nname given to the effect of thermal\nradiation on a body\u2019s orbit. As photons\ncarry momentum, when heat is radiated away from a body anisotropically, it\ncan alter the trajectory of the body due\nto the imbalance of force imparted on\nthe object. Scientists are particularly\ninterested to study this effect on Bennu,\nan asteroid that has a very low chance\nof cataclysmically impacting Earth in\naround 150 years\u2019 time. This means that\nthe research could allow us to figure out\nthe best methods for diverting any asteroids heading our way, thereby ensuring\nhumanity\u2019s continued survival.\nOSIRIS-REx is part of NASA\u2019s New\nFrontiers programme, which includes\nPluto probe New Horizons, Jupiter\nprobe Juno, and Dragonfly, an upcoming project to explore Saturn\u2019s moon\nTitan.\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nNASA probe successfully collects\nasteroid sample for Earth return Photo credits: NASA\nAn artistic depiction of OSIRIS-REx near asteroid Bennu\n\n"

I\nrealised very quickly into my degree\nthat female role models are sparse \u2013 a\nfact that almost got me to the point of\nquitting the subject altogether. Seeing\nthat reflected in the lack of diversity\nof Nobel laureates year after year was\nfrankly exhausting.\nThen in 2018 came Donna Strickland\nwinning the Physics prize for her work\non chirped pulse amplification in laser\nphysics, a mere 55 years after Maria\nGoeppert-Mayer. And, in the same\nyear there was Frances Arnold who was\nawarded a prize in Chemistry (after\nPhysics, the science in which female\nlaureates are rarest). But this year was\ndifferent. Three women\nwon science prizes,\nalmost half of all the\nscience prizes awarded\nthis year.\nAndrea Ghez won\na share of the Physics\nprize for her work on\nblack holes and \u201cthe\ndiscovery of a su-per-massive compact\nobject at the centre of\nour galaxy\u201d. In Chemistry, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer\nDoudna were the first female-only pair\nin history to win a science Nobel prize\nfor their truly revolutionary development of the genome editing method\nCRISPR. During their interviews, all\nwomen stated that they hoped that\ntheir achievements in science would\ninspire more girls and young women to\ngo into research. \u201cMy wish is that this\nwill provide a positive message to the\nyoung girls who would like to follow\nthe path of science, and to show them\nthat women in science can also have\nan impact through the research that\nthey are performing,\u201d Charpentier told\ninterviewers.\nG\u00f6ran Hanson, the secretary-general\nof the Royal\nSwedish Academy of Science, rightly\npointed out\nlast year that\nthe Nobel\ncommittees already make an\neffort to diversify the prizes\nby reaching\nout to a large\nnumber of\nuniversities,\nor by hosting Nobel Symposia on other\ncontinents. In 2019, they also explicitly\nstarted to call for nominations taking\ninto account diversity in gender, geog-raphy, and topic. However, Hanson\u2019s\nposition that it is the responsibility of\nothers to encourage women to go into\nscience is arguable, considering the\nreach of the Nobel prizes extends far\nbeyond research labs and university\ncampuses. For many girls, the Nobel\nprizes are the biggest piece of science\nnews that they hear in a year. Seeing\nthat they are overwhelmingly awarded\nto men from Europe and North America can be detrimental not just to how\nthese girls view science, but also to the\ngeneral perception of science in society.\nMoreover, a study published last\nyear by Lunnemann and others clearly\nrevealed that even the underrepresenta-tion of women in the natural sciences does not fully explain the gender\ninequality that we see in the recognitions of the Royal Swedish Academy\nof Sciences. Quite literally, the labs are\nmore diverse than the Nobel prizes.\nParticularly in the light of the recent\nBlack Lives Matter protests in the US\nand worldwide, it becomes evident that\neven with this year\u2019s evolution in the\nrecognition of women\u2019s achievements,\nthe Nobel prizes are still a bastion of\ninequality. Exactly zero of the over 600\nscience prize laureates have been Black\nresearchers, and they have been only\nmarginally more recognised with the\nliterature, peace, and economics prizes where a total of 13 Black laureates\nwhere awarded. Unless this does not undergo drastic change, the claims of the\nRoyal Academy to be striving towards\ndiversity are only empty words.\nFinally, while science may be more\ndiverse than the prizes, it should not be\noverlooked that women and researchers\nwith ethnic minority backgrounds still\nface considerable hardships in their\ncareer. Women make up less than 15%\nof authors who publish in Nature, and\nless than 2% of authors are from Africa, South America or Western Asia.\nWith citations and published papers as\nkey metrics for career advancement in\nresearch, this puts women and people\nof colour at an immense disadvantage.\nThey earn less, their papers don\u2019t get\naccepted as easily and they are less likely\nto hold positions of power. Science has\na systemic diversity problem, and while\nthis year\u2019s Nobels for Ghez, Charpentier and Doudna are a step in the right\ndirection, there remains a lot to be done\n\u2013 by all of us.\nShirin Ermis Science Writer\nEmmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, recipients of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020\nThis year\u2019s female Nobel laureates \u2013\nleading a paradigm shift?

Some 15 years\nago, physics teaching fellow, Dr Mark\nRichards, and two physics undergraduates formed a friendship that became a\nfoundation for mentoring and support\nof future Black physicists following\nin their footsteps through the famed\nBlackett Laboratory. Year after year, as\nour group grew in numbers, we became\nacutely aware of our unique identity: a\ngroup of Black people with a passion for\nphysics and positive representations of\nthe Black community \u2013 and with this\nawareness came a recognition of our\npotential to have real social impact. We\ngrew from the need for a safe space in\nwhich the handful of Black students in\nthe physics department could share a\nsense of belonging and feel supported\nin what is \u2013 for many Black students\ngenerally \u2013 a profoundly challenging\nacademic and social environment.\nIn the US, a similar story transpired\nwhen a group of Black physicists\nconvened in response to inaction by\nthe American Physical Society against\ndiscrimination and underrepresenta-tion. Founded in 1977 at Morgan State\nUniversity, the National Society of\nBlack Physicists (NSBP) today promotes the professional wellbeing of\nAfrican American physicists within\nthe scientific community. It seeks to\ndevelop and support efforts to increase\nopportunities for African Americans in\nphysics \u2013 and to increase their num-bers. In the UK,\nThe Blackett Lab\nFamily are uniquely placed to work\ntowards a similar\nend. Our mission is\nto diversify perceptions of physics\nand address under-representation of\nBlack people at all\nlevels in the field.\nThe three pillars\nsupporting this\nmission are: to represent \u2013 giving voice\nto an underrepresented group of Black\nindividuals; to connect \u2013 bringing UK\nbased Black physicists together to form\na community of talent and passion;\nand to inspire \u2013 ourselves, and others,\nregardless of gender, ethnicity, age or\noccupation \u2013 but particularly the future\ngeneration of Black physicists.\nWhen we came together in a more\nofficial capacity, the potential for The\nBlackett Lab Family to have a much\nbroader impact was clear. We had\na model of social togetherness that\nworked successfully at Imperial; scaling\nthis up to become a national community just felt right. As our student and\nprofessional lives\ndiverged over the\nyears, it became\nmore difficult to\narrange link-ups\nfor so many busy\npeople.\nAs the country\nwent into national lockdown, we\nquickly realised it\ngifted us a unique\nopportunity to\nhang out together\nvirtually \u2013 and\nin doing so, we\nstumbled upon the mechanism to enact\nthe national reach we always wanted to\nhave. Our influence and visibility on social media quickly took off \u2013 and global\nevents that followed only made our\npresence and mission all the more vital.\nRacial injustice made its way once again\nto the forefront of public consciousness,\nimpelled by the tragic deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, and the\nglobal uproar decrying systemic racism\nswelled to\nfever pitch. It\nmagnified the\nurgency of\nour work, and\nthe need to\ncreate a platform to celebrate Black\npositivity at a\ntime of acute\npressure on\nthe mental\nwellbeing of\nBlack people.\nTo date, in\njust under six\nmonths, we\nare immensely proud to\nhave connected with Black physicists at multiple\nuniversities across the UK, including\nNottingham, Warwick, Glasgow, and\nEdinburgh, and to have inspired allies\nin other physics departments to pursue\nsimilar projects that foster and nurture\ntheir Black student population. Our\nprojects have enabled both social and\neducational discourse \u2013 online discussion panels have focused on topics\nlike Why Representation Matters, and\nour Instagram page has facilitated the\nrecognition and celebration of the work\nof UK based Black physicists at Imperial and beyond. Indeed, the physics\ndepartment at Imperial have recognised\nour work and have set up a page on its\nwebsite dedicated to celebrating the\ncontributions of its Black alumni to\nscience, education and industry.\nWe are working on developing further\npartnerships and programs that nurture\nand support more Black physicists in\nthe UK, and on continuing to connect\nand support the wellbeing of current\nstudents and professionals. In doing\nso, we hope to fundamentally diversify\nthe perception of physics and physicists within the Black community and\nthe wider scientific community: such\ngrand ambitions start with The Blackett\nLab Family simply existing. Seeing and\ninteracting with other people that look\nlike you, and who share similar experiences to you, is so powerful in fostering\nthat crucial sense of belonging, and\nultimately, a sense of personal validity \u2013\nthat \u201cif they can, I can.\u201d\nRepresentation matters: The Blackett Lab\nFamily on creating a sense of belonging\nPhoto credits: The Blackett Lab Family\nOUR MISSION IS\nTO DIVERSIFY\nPERCEPTIONS\nOF PHYSICS AND\nADDRESS BLACK\nUNDERREPRESENTATION\n\u201c\nJon Lansley-Gordon Blackett Lab Family\nTo find out more, follow\nus on Instagram/Twitter\n@blackettlabfam, check\nout our website www.\ntheblackettlabfamily.com, check\nout some of our alumni at the\nDepartment of Physics www.\nimperial.ac.uk/physics/about/\nblack-physicists-at-imperial or\nfor enquiries contact connect@\ntheblackettlabfamily.com.\n\n"

The restructuring was\nprompted by the uncertain and precarious COVID-19 pandemic that rendered\nthe Union\u2019s commercial services inoper-able, as well as the declining satisfaction\nof bar and kitchen services seen in the\nprevious academic year.\nSocial distancing rules enforced since\nMarch have meant that the Union\u2019s commercial services could not operate. The\nUnion\u2019s catering services, events, bars,\nand shops have been closed since the\npandemic reached the UK, with only\nFiveSixEight being able to operate in the\nforeseeable future, under tighter restric-tions. The vast majority of commercial\nservices staff have since been placed on\nfurlough, with the Union relying on the\ngovernment\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to help cover their monthly\nwages. The Job Scheme ends in October;\nwith the projected 50% drop in retail\nrevenue for this academic year and without any staffing changes, the Union forecasted that it would have a loss of \u00a31.3M\nfor 2020/21.\nThe Union has been performing below its financial expectations for the\npast two years. Unsuccessful operational\ndecisions such as Union breakfast and\ncutting Freshers\u2019 fortnight events, as well\nas the health and safety issues near the\nstart of the 2019/20 academic year that\nforced kitchens to close for around 10\nweeks, have resulted in cost issues that\nwere only exacerbated by the pandemic.\nA staff consultation was thereby initiated on August 4th 2020, concluding on\nSeptember 18th, to consider the proposed changes on its staff restructuring\nwith the end goal of achieving financial\nsustainability and better delivering the\nservices that students want.\nThe Union originally had 64.9 FTE,\nincluding sabbatical officers with a total salary bill of \u00a32.726M, including\nthe averaged 28% add-ons of taxes and\npensions. The restructuring involved\nrethinking the Union\u2019s entire staffing\nmodel and shifting the salary balance\nfrom one with a higher proportion spent\non management and oversight roles, to\none that spends\nmore on roles\ndelivering the\nservices.\nFo l l o w i n g\nthe conclusion\nof the consulta-tion, some staff\nmembers have\nbeen moved to\ndifferent roles,\nsomeweremade\nredundant, and\nsome with Suitable Alternative\nEmployment\nopportunities\nwere assessed\nin and offered\nnew roles.\nOverall, 20 staff\nmembers have\nbeen made re-dundant, most\ncoming from\nCommercia l\nServices.\nThe restructuring will\nsave the Union\naround \u00a31.1m\na year in salary costs, with\n\u00a3846K from the\nremoval of posts that were filled, and\n\u00a3254K from the removal of posts that\nwere vacant. Positions that have been\nabolished in the new structure include:\nall Bars and Catering roles other than\nthe Operations Manager role; the Head\nof Communications and Systems role;\nthe Administration Support Manager\nrole; the Senior Designer and Marketing and Communications Coordinator\nroles, which have been combined into\none post; reducing the number of Retail\nAssistant roles from 5 to 2 FTE; reducing the number of Retail Supervisors/\nShift Leaders from 3 to 1 FTE.\nSome of the staff who have been made\nredundant were furloughed when they\nwere given noticed and unable to return\nto the workplace before their notice period ends. Whilst furloughed Union\nstaff members\u2019 monthly wages were 80%\ncovered by the government Job Retention Scheme, the Union committed to\npaying the remaining 20%, including for\ncasual bar staff.\nThe new staffing structure would also\nfulfil the objective of transforming the\nstudent union for the better. Other than\nchanges in the staff positions available,\nchanges were also made in line management to \u201cstreamline\u201d the team. In the\nprevious structure the 3 main Directorates reporting to the Managing Director were Membership Services (student\nopportunities, advice and representa-tion); Communications and Systems;\nCommercial Services and Facilities\n(licensed trade, catering, bars, events,\nconferencing). Under the new staffing\nmodel, the responsibilities of the three\nmain Directorates have been redistributed under different line managers and\nmanagement groups.\nTom Flynn, Managing Director of\nthe Union, noted that \u201ccolleagues have\nIsabelle Zhang Deputy Editor in Chief\nFollowing the pandemic and social distancing rules, the Union\u2019s catering services, events, bars, and shops have been closed.

This allows employers with both\nfull-time and part-time employees\nto compare employee numbers.\nSuitable Alternative Employment\nEmployers are legally required to\noffer employees suitable alternative employment opportunities if\nmaking their position redundant.\nSuitable opportunities depend on\nthe similarity of the alternative position to their current job, the skills\nand abilities required, the terms of\nthe job offered, and the payment\n\n"

Though\nI\u2019ve been aware of the trio\u2019s trap-per-turned-rapper, kings of Buffalo\nstatus, it was only after hearing their\nscorching Fire in the Booth earlier this\nyear that I began to explore their dis-cography. Considering they\u2019ve released\neight albums between them so far this\nyear, I figured the group was probably\nputting in extra work to capitalise on\nthe attention the freestyle had garnered.\nBut taking\na closer\na look at\ntheir dis-cography,\nbrothers\nConway\nthe Machine and\nWestside\nGunn\nreleased\n3 albums\nin 2019\nand 6(!)\nalbums in\n2018 re-spectively,\nand cousin\nBenny the\nButcher also put out 3 albums in 2018\n\u2013 a consistently crazy work rate clearly\nruns in their blood. As Benny conveys\nthroughout this new album, Burden of\nProof, their street lifestyle has clearly\ninstilled a level of rigour, discipline, and\nambition that can be transferred to hip\nhop.\nThe opening line of the album on the\ntitular intro track conveys just that:\n\u201cLast year was about branding, this\none about expanding\u201d. The track is\nimmediately head-bobbing: an electric\nguitar refrain begins the instrumental\nbefore being swept away by regal horns\nand drums. Benny comes with steady,\nin-your-face bars before slipping into a\npoly-syllabic flow: \u201c\u2026prison phases\u2026decision making\u2026frige-rator\u2026killers waitin\u2026reno-vatin\u201d. The dynamic between\nHit-Boy\u2019s production and Benny\u2019s flow\non this track and others throughout\nthe album is reminiscent of the chemistry Kanye and Pusha T had on 2018\u2019s\nDAYTONA \u2013 a gold standard when it\ncomes to modern gangster rap albums.\nAcross the track list, Hit Boy effectively\nblends grandiose drums, ear-catching\nsynths and dramatic vocal samples in\njust the right ratios to paint an appropriate backdrop for Benny\u2019s bars. On\n\u2018Sly Green\u2019, where Benny rhymes about\nhis authenticity compared to trend-rid-ing rappers claiming street experience,\nthe drums are larger than life and the\nsynths are\neffer-vescent.\nFaster,\nthumping\ndrums\ncomplement\nskipping,\npensive\nsynth taps\non \u2018Over\nthe Limit\u2019,\na track\nthat goes\nmore biographical\nas Benny\nreferences\nthe bond\nhe has with his day ones, ducking the\nFBI and the strife that drug dealing put\non his marriage and livelihood.\nThe mellower instrumentals in the\nsecond half of the album are impressive\ntoo and blend with Benny\u2019s reflective\nwisdom to make for great tracks \u2013 on\n\u2018New Streets\u2019, sober drums, synths and\npiano keys layer a sweet blues vocal sample as Benny contests the glorification\nof a \u201cgame [that] come with way more\nconsequences than jail\u201d. He stresses to\nthose unfamiliar with the lifestyle that\nthere\u2019s \u201ctwo sides, one glamorous, other\nscandalous\u201d where finding lessons in\nthe losses is routine. He reflects further\non his losses, particularly\nthat of his brother,\non \u2018Trade it All\u2019.\nOver gooey\nsynths, stuttering drums\nand anguished\nvocal samples,\nhe lets us know\nwhat keeps him\ngrounded when\nsurrounded by material wealth: \u201c\u2026so you can\nhave it all / If it mean I get my brother\nback tomorrow\u201d.\n\u2018Famous\u2019 is a track that comes short\n\u2013 the looped hollering vocal sample\nquickly gets annoying as Benny express-es, through pretty forgettable bars, how\nfame isn\u2019t what he expected. \u2018Timeless\u2019\nis also disappointing \u2013 the instrumental,\nwhich sounds like Street Fighter character selection menu music, is looped to\nthe point of boring and Lil Wayne and\nBig Sean\u2019s verses are generic. \u2018Where\nWould I Go\u2019 earlier in the album which\nfeatures Rick Ross is a track I\u2019m still\nunsure on. The beat starts with a slow,\ndreamy vocal sample that goes distorted\nand psychedelic as\nit gets submerged\nby a lumbering\ndrum and then\na weird synth\njingle, while\nBenny reminisces on\nhow he made\nit from \u201cthe\nconcrete\u201d. A better\nfeature appears on\n\u2018One Way Flight\u2019\nwhere Freddie Gibbs\ndelivers a short but\nwitty verse and\na hilarious\nhook that\nsums up\nthe pre-dicta-bility of masculine toxicity regardless of\nwealth: \u201cYou gon\u2019 cry in that Toyota or\nthis Maybach?\u201d.\nThe last few tracks of the album close it\non a high. On \u2018Thank God I Made It\u2019,\na piano-led, pitched up vocal sample\nand distorted drum creates a mel-low, Late Registration-like vibe.\nBenny starts his verse with\nan homage to his mother\nand matured reflections on\nthe debt he owes her for\nmaking the job of being\na single parent even more\ndifficult. Through his experiences and losses, he\u2019s come\nupon a new level of connection\nand devotion to family: \u201cI look in\nmy nephew eyes and I see my brother\n/ Sometimes I gotta look away \u2018cause\nit hurt so much\u201d. The other two thirds\nof Griselda join Benny on \u2018War Paint\u2019,\nwhere off-kilter strings and dreamy\nwailing make the instrumental sound\nlike something off an Earl Sweatshirt\nproject. The final track, \u2018Legend\u2019, is one\nof the best of the album. Melodic keys\nover a shuffling drum make for a warm\nbut striding backdrop to Benny\u2019s four\ntight verses that effectively combine\nthe braggadocious and reflective vibes\nof the album, with a trap drum layer\ncoming in for alternate verses. \u201cChecks\novergrown, neck boulder stones / Ever\nsince they said I\u2019m goin\u2019 pro, they said\nI\u2019m the next so-and-so\u201d is a catchy pair\nof bars if I ever heard one. It\u2019s the combined quality of Benny\u2019s flow, lyrical\nattention and raw wisdom \u2013 not just\non this track, but across the album\n\u2013 that make undeniable justification for his assertion on the hook:\n\u201cSaid I\u2019ma be a legend soon, I\u2019m a\nlegend now\u201d.

And by\nthat, I mean that IA needs to work for\nevery single club, in its own unique way,\nso that everyone reaps the long-term\nbenefits. Sport at Imperial has operated in a pretty weird way for as long as\nanyone can remember, with committee\nmembers bearing the brunt of the work\nmanaging teams, sessions and competition entries. Having the Union and\nMove Imperial as two separate entities\ndealing with club sport is confusing,\nand there isn\u2019t a centralised athletics\nunion that just \u2018sorts it\u2019 unlike other\nuniversities.\nIA aims to solve this and be a one-stop shop for enabling sport to happen.\nThe key word here is \u2018enabling\u2019 \u2013 IA\nshould never be a barrier to entry for\nsport, or an obstacle preventing activities from happening. Ideally, a club\nshould just be able to say, \u201cWe have 4\nteams, train twice a week, have games\nevery week \u2013 we need umpires, pitches\nand equipment\u201d, and it will all be sorted by IA. Committee members won\u2019t\nhave to sacrifice their degrees to run\ntheir clubs, and the workload would be\ntransferred to full-time staff members\nwho would be running the operational\nside of sport.\nThis vision is set out in James Medler\u2019s document submitted to Council\nin 2018, searchable with \u201cImperial College Union Sports Hub\u201d, and has been\nratified by clubs and students over the\nyears. However, the launch not been\nsmooth, to say the least \u2013 the rollout to\nTeamFieldandTeamCourtwasdelayed\nlast year, and the rollout to all clubs this\nyear has been fraught with issues. Part\nofthisstemsfrompoorcommunication\nbetween Move Imperial, the Union and\nstudents, something that is still a huge\nissue now. I have personally been frustrated when decisions have been made\nthat have not been communicated to\nstudents in a timely manner, leading to\neveryone having a ton of questions and\nnot knowing why their membership\nhas suddenly been fixed at \u00a325, for ex-ample. This is something that has been\nhighlighted in meetings and is something that staff have acknowledged that\nneeds improving.\nTheothermainproblemthathasarisenisthatwhileIAisgreatforsportsthat\nfit into the training-matches-competi-tions model, using Move Imperial facilities and having a predictable schedule,\nmaking it work for other clubs like Surf,\nPoloandSailing,tonameafew,requires\ndetailed conversations between all parties involved. Many of these have frankly just not happened, leading to committees not knowing how to administer\ntheir cash flow, or knowing what to tell\ntheir casual members, or just knowing\nwhy IA should even be for them.\nI appreciate that I haven\u2019t gone into\nthe details of why there should be a\ntiered system, or how \u00a325 will fund\nthe activities that clubs want to run, or\nanything about Imperial Leagues, and\nif anyone wants more clarity, they\u2019re\nmore than welcome to reach out. I want\nto make it clear that we know there are\nissues, and it hasn\u2019t been good enough\nso far, but we are working to rectify it.\nI have seen the amount of work that\nMove Imperial and the Union have put\ninto it, and with proper communication with everyone involved, it\u2019s going\nto be a success.\nIf you want to share your club\u2019s\nopinions on Imperial Athletes, get in\ntouch at: fcomment@ic.ac.uk.\nAnother year gone, another Felix\nsex survey. Another opportunity to find out how many people have\nhad sex in the library or to check if your\ndepartment is getting it on the most.\nOne thing that impresses me each\nyear is the variety of experiences, which\nconsistently serves as a reminder that\nThis year, it was interesting to see that\n67% of the 24.67% of virgins who took\nthe survey were asexual. To be asexual\ndoes not mean to concretely abstain\nfrom sex; some asexual people just have\nlittle to no interest in sex and some\nmay have more interest. Emphasising\nthat the idea of virgins as people who\n\u2018just can\u2019t get laid\u2019, fails to capture the\nautonomy and diverse preferences that\nmany have. Whilst I hope that people\nare losing their virginity when they feel\ncomfortable to do so, there has always\nbeensocietalpressurestohave\u2018theright\namount of sex\u2019. Couple this with a very\nmyopic view on those who choose to\ndeviate from that narrow standard and\nit becomes clear that the first time may\nnot be a good time for many. Furthermore, I think it\u2019s important to note\nthat while there has slowly been more\nunderstanding over time about the\nproblematic nature and consequences\nof slut-shaming (judging women for\nhaving \u2018too much\u2019 sex), there is a lot of\nignorance around virginity, especially for university students. We should\nbe mindful that the pendulum doesn\u2019t\nswing from one extreme to the other.\nStudent relationships among Imperial students were surprisingly high to\nme. Logistically, it makes sense but I\nhave heard discussions about how one\nshould under no circumstance date\nanother Imperial student. Let alone\nsomeone in the same course or, heaven\nforbid, someone in the same halls. Yet\nthe survey has revealed 66.3% of those\nin relationships are with somebody\nwho is either a current student or an\nalumnus. It doesn\u2019t stop there though,\nit seems that inter-department dating is\nthemostlikelyoptionformany,andthe\nlikelihood of that love story beginning\nin student halls is very high (for heterosexual couples specifically). So, despite\nthe cautionary proverb to not soil in\nyour own nest, it seems Imperial students are willing to risk potential future\nawkwardness for someone who may be\n\u2018The One\u2019, which is quite sweet to me.\nIwouldliketoemphasisethatregardless of how you view sex, it is something\nthat can affect and connect people in\npositive ways, but certain experiences\ncan also do the opposite. It is concerning to see that only 8.88% of sexual harassment cases are reported. With 2.42%\nof males, 11.08% of females and 6.67%\nof non-binary individuals saying they\nhad been sexually harassed at least once.\nSexual harassment is something that\nonly the perpetrator is at blame for, and\nthe emotional weight the experience\nmay leave on a student is not a burden\nthathastobecarriedalone.Beingmind-ful of sexual health is also important for\nwellbeing, so the fact that 51.45% of respondents have never tested themselves\nfor STIs is quite worrying. Information\non STIs and sexual health services are\nwidely available to students, NHS and\nSHL (Sexual Health London) are good\nsites to visit.\nFinally, it may be tempting to look\nat all the data and compare yourself to\nothersinanegativeway,butIthinkthat\nthis survey provides a unique opportunity to see that you may not be the only\none who likes things the way you do.\nFor help in different scenarios:\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-re-sources/procedures/sexual-harassment-sex-ual-misconduct-and-sexual-violence-/\nThoughts on the 2020 Felix Sex Survey\nImperial Athletes\nNobody asked, but Khama Gunde has shared her opinions regardless\nKhamaGunde\nCommentEditor\nGeoffreySheir\nSportsChair\nSports Chair Geoffrey Sheir gives his opinions on Imperial Athletes: the new one-stop shop for sport for Imperial students\n\n"

Approximately 150 Imperial students have been\naffected by the news.\nImperial students will be moved to\nChapter housing in Islington, from\nThursday, using a professional removals\ncompany paid for by NHG and taxis\nprovided by Imperial. They will, how-ever, be separated from UWL students\nwho will be moved to Wembley and residents that will be moved into hotels.\nThe building was completed in a mere\n21 months in 2007 by the Berkeley First,\npart of the luxury developer Berkeley\nHomes group. The \u00a3100 million project\nwon awards including the Major housing project of the year 2007 award for\nits innovative construction that saw a\n6-story building be constructed in only\n5 days.\nThis was a major undertaking for the\ncompany that had previously never constructed a building taller than 9 stories.\nThe Paragon complex incorporates a\n17-story tower.\nThe construction process was also\nvery rapid with a modular construction\ntechnique employed that shaved a whole\nyear of the building process in comparison to traditional techniques. However,\nquestions are raised as articles from the\ntime recount how the company did not\nhave time to let the concrete core of the\nbuilding completely dry before bolting\nconnecting steelwork to it. Additionally,\nat the time the 17-story tower was believed to be the tallest modular building\nin the world.\nThe complex is now owned by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) a housing\nassociation whose stated purpose is \u201cto\nprovide decent and affordable homes for\nlower-income households\u201d.\nFollowing the deaths of 72 people in\nthe Grenfell fire tragedy flaws in the design of the Paragon complex were identified and measures to bring the building\nback into fire compliance were begun in\n2017. NHG also began legal action in\n2018 against 4 companies involved in\nthe construction of the building to recoup the cost of the \u00a38 million cladding\nreplacement and fire break installation\njob, including the architects.\nKatie Bond, group director of sales\nand building safety at NHG, said: \u201cThis\nis not solely a cladding issue.\u201d The results\nof surveys, the most recent in the past\ntwo weeks, were \u201clike peeling an onion\u201d\nof layer upon layer of fire defects. She\nwould not say which issue exactly had\nprompted the evacuation.\nWhile defects were known about in\n2017 more recent surveys and updated\nadvice from consultants working with\nNHG stated that interim measures such\nas \u2018waking watches\u2019, a 24/7 fire warden,\nand special evacuation procedures were\nno longer sufficient and that the problems in the building were so bad that\nevacuation was necessary.\nA college spokesperson has told Felix that \u201cWe sought and received robust\nassurances about the building\u2019s safety\nbefore securing this student accommodation.\u201d\nFelix has been told that evacuation\nwill also allow the taking out of bath-rooms, wall and appliances in order to\nidentify the full extent of the problems\nand demolition has not been ruled out.\nStudents will remain in Islington for\nthe forseeable future with no plans to\nmove back to Brentford.\nUWL, Churchmore, Caledonian\nmodular, CJCT have not responded to\nrequests to comment.\nCalum Drysdale Editor in Chief\nThe exterior of the Paragon Complex in Brentford. Questions have been raised as the stability and safety of the building and why the College felt it was\nappropriate to house students in halls with known fire safety shortcomings\nCredits: Imperial College\nEditorial\nThe evacuation of students from\nthe Paragon complex made national newspapers and the College has\nreacted very quickly moving students\nto another halls. However, questions\nshould be asked as to why the College\nwas willing to place first year students\nin halls with a known safety prob-lem. Students will also have formed\nconnections with UWL students that\nthey will now not be able to see. This\nshould not have occured.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 23RD OCTOBER 2020\n13\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nCOMMENT\nMany of us will have heard of \u2018the\nNorth-South divide\u2019 in casual\nbanter and passing conversation,\nusually between a Mancunian with\nno personality and an Essex boy. This\nincludes but is not limited to: \u2018Reading\nis way better than Leeds\u2019, \u2018why does\neveryone get offended in the South?\u2019 or\n\u2018mate, why are you drinking a mug of\ngravy?\u2019.\nDespite its superficial appearance,\nthere is an overwhelming amount of\nevidence to suggest the North-South\ndivide cuts deep into the UK\u2019s health,\nsocial and economic systems, putting\nnortherners at a significant disadvan-tage. This may be best exemplified\nthrough the government\u2019s management\nof COVID-19.\nAs you have probably heard by now,\nLondon has been moved to Tier 2 on\nBoJo\u2019s 3-Tier system. This news probably came to your dismay; no more\ngatherings of six indoors? Restaurants\nclosed at 10pm? No meeting anybody\noutside your house or support bubble?\nIt\u2019s a nightmare!\nWhat you may not know is that\nManchester has been fighting to remain in this tier, with the government\nimposing Tier 3 on its Merseyside\nneighbour Liverpool with threats of\nsimilar fates for the football capital.\nTier 3 means no mingling with anybody outside your house or bubble at\nall, be it in your gran\u2019s tea room or the\nbeautiful (and very safe) parks that\nLiverpool has to offer; conversely, you\ncan still get a carvery dinner and a pint\nin your local harvesters surrounded by\n100s of strangers provided that your table of 6 is within your support bubble\nor household.\nThe ramifications of a Tier 3 lockdown are quite dire. On a social level\na lot of people will be locked back up\nin their tiny claustrophobic houses\n\u2013 many without gardens - unable to\nsocialise with their friends, work out\nin the gym or have a pint in the pub\n(the last option a fair sacrifice in my\nopinion). Economically, Liverpool\nwill trundle to a halt with most of the\nservice sector out of business and it\nmay not recover causing the loss of\nmany independent stores, restaurants\nand venues.\nOne may argue that the reason\nLiverpool has been put into Tier 3 is\nbecause COVID-19 transmission is\nhigher there and as a result, restrictions must be tighter; of course, this\nis true but the root cause for this high\ntransmission rate isn\u2019t Liverpool\u2019s\nfault. When Eat Out to Help Out\n(EOTHO) started, us Londoners were\necstatic; on the first day I got a starter,\nramen and a large\njuice from Waga\u2019s for under\na tenner, my\nlife may have\npeaked there\nto be honest. It\nwas a great time\nfor everybody\nin the UK,\nwe basked in\nthe 30-degree\nsummer heat,\npeople were\nout and about,\nrestaurants and\npubs were open, lockdown must have\nended right? If the government are\nliterally paying for us to eat out then\nsurely we must be in the clear? This\nmay have been true for London; by\nits nature, London had a high peak at\nthe start of the pandemic and quickly\ndropped to a more manageable level\nbut this wasn\u2019t the case for smaller cities though; these had a smaller initial\npeak, but the drop wasn\u2019t as rapid and\ncases were sustained for longer.\nThe government decided to implement EOTHO to bring money back\ninto the economy and get the service\nsector moving again because the\nfaster this happened, the faster the UK\ncould recover from the pandemic; in\nprinciple this is a good idea, we can\u2019t\nexactly stay in lockdown until we have\na vaccine, then expect the economy to\nbe unaffected in the system we operate\nin. The reason this scheme may have set\nthe UK back, according to the Mayor\nof Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is that it operated strictly on a\nLondon timeline. As soon as London\ngot to a manageable death rate, they\nimplemented EOTHO but the smaller\ncities like Manchester, Liverpool and\nLeeds still didn\u2019t have a stable death\nrate so were in a much more precarious\nposition than London. As a result, the\ncitizens of these cities ventured out to\npubs and to restaurants and since the\ngovernment told them\nthey were safe,\nthey slowly let\ntheir COVID\nguards down.\nPeople mingled and the\nvirus slowly but\nsurely started\nworking its way\nthrough the\npopulation,\nleading us to\nwhere we are\nnow.\nThere is no\nhiding the fact that the North is being\ndisproportionately affected by the\npandemic; the North East and West\nhave the highest hospital admissions\nper 100,000 and positive/negative test\nratio of anywhere in the UK and it isn\u2019t\njust the London-centric management\nplan that caused this. If you look at the\nvariables dictating whether a region\nwill handle a pandemic such as COVID-19\u2019s well, the North has definitely\ndrawn the short straw; the North is\npoorer, its demographics are more\nvulnerable, its people are more likely\nto live in urban areas than in rural\nand according to the ONS (Office for\nNational Statistics), its industries force\nmore people to go out and work as\nopposed to working from home. This\ncocktail of risk factors predisposes the\nNorth to vulnerability and when the\ngovernment doesn\u2019t prioritise this, it\nis easy to see why places like Liverpool\nhave been shoved into Tier 3. It is also\nclear that this isn\u2019t a sustainable management plan.\nTwo main factors affecting regional\nburden of COVID-19 are how urban\nthe area is and how deprived the area\nis. If we look at London, it is almost\n100% urban (hence the huge initial rise\nin cases) but according to the ONS,\n\u201cjobs based in workplaces in London\nand the South East are much more\nlikely to be possible to do from home\ncompared with the rest of the UK,\nprobably due to a higher proportion\nof professional occupations in the\nregion\u201d, (hence the rapid, early decline\nin cases).\nIf we look at the rest of the South\nas a whole, it is more rural and less\ndeprived meaning that the burden will\nbe lower. If we look at the North there\nis definitely more deprivation, but this\nis okay in rural areas since transmission\nis lower but in cities and towns where\nthe population is urban, COVID-19\ncan spread rapidly without adequate\nintervention, infrastructure and management to stop it.\nIf the North-South divide isn\u2019t\naddressed, there will always be health,\nsocial and economic inequality and a\nlarge proportion of the population will\nnot reach their true potential due to\nthe area they were born in. There are\na lot of problems in the UK and these\nare definitely exacerbated by COVID-19 but maybe the silver lining of\nthis pandemic is that we can highlight\nand address the massive inequalities\npresent in the UK which include but\nare by no means limited to the NorthSouth Divide.\nThe Vice President and Regalia Officer of the new Imperial College Northern Society talks about why the North feels like it is\nbeing neglected during the pandemic\nCOVID-19 and the North-South divide\nManishMandal\nNorthernSocRegaliaOfficer\nIF THE NORTHSOUTH DIVIDE ISN\u2019T\nADDRESSED, THERE\nWILL ALWAYS BE\nHEALTH, SOCIAL\nAND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY\n\u201c\n\n"

Comprising both gallery space\nand teaching rooms the centre runs both classes and exhibitions.\nFelix spoke to Mindy Lee, the curator and artist in residence at the Blyth centre to discuss the role of the centre at Imperial.\nLee told Felix that she believed that the Blyth Centre\nwas here to inspire and to support via exploring cre-ativity. She told us that \u201cWe are an oasis; offer[ing]\nprecious time away from the everyday demands, which\nis vital for well-being. Especially in this strange time,\nart and music are medicine for the soul. It can be used\nas a tool for self-expression and or bring you together\nwith other like-minded people for a collective, stress\nreleasing experience. This is enormously beneficial and\nnourishing for both students and staff.\u201d\nLee told Felix about the changes that had had to occur\ntoallowtheBlythcentretocontinuetofunctionwhilst\nstill following social distancing requirements. While\nnormally The Blyth Centre would see exhibitions in\nthe Blyth Gallery and Art events in the Blyth Art Studio these areas have had to remain closed. However,\nthe Visual Arts education and exhibition programme\nhas been moved and continued robustly online. In ad-dition, The Blyth Art Fellowships and Arts Awards are\nstill taking place with remote support. Music practice\nrooms can be booked, allowing students to practice in\npeace and quiet and lunchtime concerts are still going\nahead, which students can attend in person.\nLee told Felix that one of the upsides of responding\nto the pandemic was that the Blyth Centre now has\nits own You Tube channel, meaning that if you miss a\nclass,orconcertyoucanaccesstheirarchiveatatimeto\nsuit you.

The mailing list can be signed\nup to at: https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/\nblyth-art-centre\nLee also explained why the Blyth centre was relevant\nto non-artistic people as well as those that are more\nexperienced. She explained that art is for everyone to\nexplore, enjoy and respond to. Just as you do not have\nto be a musician to listen to a concert, or an artist to see\nan exhibition, you can enjoy enjoy watching an artist\nmake.\nShewentontosay\u201cIntermsofcreativelydoing,Ithink\nwe can be overly self-critical.

Despite taking a year off from\nreleases in 2019 as a duo, Billy Woods\nwas working harder than ever, delivering\nnot one but two conceptually and lyrically tight records. Concerns would be\nwell founded therefore, as to the ability\nand stamina of the pair to come through\nwith a record as polished as 2018\u2019s Paraffin. Shrines however delivers a unique\n\u2013 if unnerving \u2013 experience.\nBuilt on saturated, off-kilter drum\nloops, grainy samples and a seemingly\nunending barrage of cultural references,\nthe duo conjure apocalyptic worlds on\neach of Shrine\u2019s 14 tracks. E L U C I D\nand Billy seem to hold musical convention and listenability in contempt,\nor at least take pleasure in perverting\nthem throughout the LP. On \u2018Charms\u2019\nmetallic percussion drops in and out of\nthe mix over an overblown flute sample\nwhile the pair deliver their intricate\nrhyme schemes which blur street smarts\nand spirituality \u201cStark phenomenon,\nfaith starts when shit stops addin\u2019 up/\nCharge it to the game, plus tax just\nwhen you had enough\u201d raps E L U C I\nD, later referencing early Christian mysticism and a strange theory that Eve (Of\nGenesis) had a sister. The pair\u2019s fascination with Judeo-Christian mysticism\npermeates the record, with references\nto obscure philosophies on wealth, time\nand rap culture popping up on tracks\nlike \u2018Flava Flav\u2019 and \u2018Eucharist\u2019 where\nthe line \u201cChristianity is cultural appropriation\u201d alone is mind blowing, and\ngives the album as a whole more substance for listeners who enjoy through\nanalyses and obscure theologies.\nElsewhere a range of guest features\nincluding Earl Sweatshirt, R.A.P\nFerreira (formerly Milo),\nAkai Solo and more do\nwell to break up the pairs\nfocused but cryptic and\ndark themes, steering\ntheir tracks onto (rela-tively) more conventional\nthemes. R.A.P. Ferreira\u2019s\nfeature on \u2018Dead Cars\u2019\nis a particular highlight,\nwhere a more traditional\ninstrumental ornamented\nby childish synth chords\nprovides a pensive backdrop for meditations a\ndecaying culture, which\nseems less distant with\neach passing day.\nShrines is an alienating listen, but this\nis precisely what experimental hip-hop\nfans will love it for, with poetic lyrics\nand abstract instrumentals, it comes on\nlike a collage from some meta-cultural\njunkyard, a challenge, but a rewarding\none.\nPhoto credits: Bandcamp\nExtrawelt are surely one of the good\nmemories of the minimal era. The\ngenre\u2019s rise to the zenith of the club\nscene was rapid \u2013 it was everywhere\nfrom Ibiza to Tokyo. Reading about it\nnow, the evolution of this throbbing,\nclicking artery of club music of the mid-2000s was quite divergent. Some of it\ntried to stay true to the minimal form\nthat was fighting to stay relevant, while\nsome tended towards early tech house\nand rode the wave of its popularity for\nthe next decade. In a sense, Extrawelt\nsometimes exist somewhere between\nthe two. In the more uplifting corners\nof their discography, the production\ntends to be quite progressive, whereas\nthe essence of their hooks stays quite\nminimalist.\nThere are varying degrees to which you\ncan strip down a groove for it to still\nsound coherent. Still, there are three\nmain aspects that a good minimal track\nneeds to obtain that propulsive feeling.\nThe first is a bas that oozes funk and\nneeds little to no variation, the second\nare percussion samples which sound\nlike you fed your grandmother\u2019s china\ncollection through a woodchipper. Lastly, and most importantly, the producer\nneeds a knack for pushing the progression forward so seamlessly, that only\nwhen the eventual breather just before\nthe drop comes, you are able to see the\nmountain of sound.\nThe most recent release by Extrawelt\ncomes on Traum Schalplatten, the minimal goliath that now mainly dabbles in\nsweet German melodic techno. It kicks\noff with Mr. Wednesday, a thumping\nbassline which flashes its razory teeth to\nvarying degrees, always smoothly foreshadowing a switch-up in the percus-sion. The production is excellent, with\nthe beautiful use of effects being backed\nup by the frightening industrial sounds\nthat the producer duo are known for.\nUnfortunately, despite being bouncy as\nhell, perfect for some peak time shape\ncutting, it could be\nperceived as lacking\nsubtlety.\nThe title track of the\nEP is rhythmically\nmore interesting. Its\nstumbling bassline\nsegues wonderfully\ninto the percussive\nbackbone of the\ntrack, which keeps\nup with the pace of\nscene changes set\nby the opener. The\nbreakdown is especially rewarding,\nwith the bas suddenly disappearing and\nleaving the aftertaste of an early morning at a warehouse rave.\nFinally, we have SEM, which is the\nmost minimal of all the tracks. It\u2019s fast,\ndecisive, with some unusually delicate,\nglassy perc sounds filling the void left by\nthe oppressive machinegun high hats in\nmoments of downtime. An output worthy of the duo\u2019s otherworldly moniker.\nReviewed by Martin Flerin Music Editor\nLittle We Know\nAlbumby: Extrawelt\nToptrack:Little We Know\nForfansof: Max Cooper, Dominik\nEulberg, Minilogue\nRuntime: 20 minutes\nPhoto credits: Traum Schallplatten\nHard-hitting EP from Hamburg duo\n\n"

Everything that I have seen and\nheard tells me that the Union was not\nready to introduce such a major change\nand their stubbornness will not endear\nthem to the student body. Despite the\npromises being made eventual func-tionality, we call on Imperial to halt the\nroll out of Imperial Athletes and return\npurchased membership fees to the\nclubs that attracted them.\nThe actions of the Union betray their\nattitudes to student sport. In interview\nwith DPCS Ross Unwin he spoke with\ngreat feeling and conviction about the\nsavings in time and effort that the new\nscheme would bring students, allowing\nthem to focus on playing their sport\nand not waste time on admin. This is\npatronising and should be flagged up.\nPeople join the committees of societies not only because they want to play\nmore sport but also because they value\nthe community and the activity of the\nsociety so much that they are willing to\nspend time and effort on making that\nclub activity available to other mem-bers. The belief that students should\nnot assume these positions of responsibility is a kick in the teeth to all the\nhighly impressive committee members\nat Imperial who throw themselves\ninto their societies in order to give\ntheir members the best time possible.\nTime after time the Union forgets that\nstudent led activities are what students\nwant and top down impositions will be\nresented. The independence of sports\nclubs is of vital importance and once\nlost will be very difficult to get back.\nFurthermore, why should large clubs\nbe the beneficiaries of subsidy, support\nand intramural leagues that allow them\nto continue playing their sport while\nsmaller clubs must handle disappearing\nmembership revenue and being side-lined. This is rank inequality and the\nUnion should apologise for it.\nAccepting this new scheme is the same\nas accepting mediocrity. Time savings\naccrued now will be paid back in frustration and bureaucratic inefficiency\nonce lockdowns begin to ease and clubs\nbegin stretching their muscles and\nwanting to do their own thing.\nFRIDAY 23RD OCTOBER 2020\nEDITORIAL\n15\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nWe here at Felix believe that it is always in the interests of the students to\nknow.

Often a curators\u2019 vision is encumbered by financial decisions, logistics, and,\nas in most cases with an exhibition of an artist\u2019s work,\nhis/her repertoire. In that sense \u2014 exhibitions focussing on a theme as opposed to an artist, particularly\none that sources from different eras, artists, and medi-ums, are truly a curator\u2019s playground.\n\u2018Sin\u2019, The National Gallery\u2019s latest exhibition, is one\nsuchattempttotacklethehighlyphilosophicalsubject.\nTheological interpretations of sin and penance, to a\nconsiderable extent, shape our customs and traditions.\nWestern Judaeo-Christian theology is scattered with\ndefinitions and examples of sin; and Art, uncomfortably married with religion for most its life since Grecian\ntimes, has broadly aimed to espouse this.\nThe exhibition brings forth a diverse sampling of exhibits to structure this narrative. We see works by Agnolo Bronzino, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Andy Warhol, and Tracy Emin\u2026 indeed the whole spectrum, and\nthey all ask one question - what is your sin?\nAndy Warhol greets us with his canvases crying out\n\u2014 \u2018Repent and sin no more\u2019. And indeed, before you\nget to claim innocence, Cranach\u2019s \u2018Adam and Eve\u2019 reminds us of our eternal guilt, with the first sin. There\nare also multiple versions of this in the exhibition lest\nwe forget.\nWhat follows is an unrelenting exposition of the hypocrisy of theological judgement manifested through\nart within this tiny room. Lust as sin \u2014 check. Gate\npasses to heaven handed out by clergy in return for\nconfessions \u2014 check. However, the exhibition is scant\nof any sort of judge-ment, leaving that to us,\nand traces the outlines\nof evolving morality\nthrough these selective\nexhibits.\nThe centre piece of the\nexhibition is a \u2018strange\u2019\njuxtaposition of Tracy\nEmin\u2019s \u2018It was just a kiss\u2019,\nand Bronzino\u2019s \u2018Venus\nand Cupid\u2019 (inset). The\nlatter, a masterpiece of\nthe mannerism school,\nis the highlight of the\nexhibition. The mosaic painting depicts the\nmother-son duo, Venus\nand Cupid. In stunning\nand \u2018explicit\u2019 detail, it\nshows the two in a lovers\u2019\nembrace, and is a commentary in itself about\nthe morality of the ages.\nThis contrast with the\ncontextual suggestiveness\nof Tracy Emins\u2019s artwork\nreally does work.\nBut it is tough reconciliation to witness Tracy\nEmin\u2019s work hang beside Bronzino\u2019s, or even share the\nsamehallsasVelazquez\u2019s\u2018TheImmaculateConception\u2019.\nMaybe to judge the former\u2019s work as lesser is my sin.\nOn second thoughts, I will stand by that judgement\nand live with it.\nItisinterestingtonotetheprevalenceofRoman-Grecian mythology in Art, despite it fundamentally subverting any notion of Judaeo-Christian conservatives\nor notions of sin, with its ubiquitous promiscuity of\ngods, rapes, and incest.\nBut amidst all this, the message is clear; through the\nyears, Art strived as much to be a medium of message\nas it was craft. At the end of the day, sin, or one\u2019s personal definition of it is, ahem\u2026 personal. And that is\ntruly what the exhibition seeks to convey. Whether it\npresented the best case for that? Well, I would not be\ndoing justice if I imposed my opinion on you, would I?\nAfterall,it\u2019safreeexhibition.So,giveitatry,confessto\nthese tableaux, and you just might come out the other\nside \u2014 sin free.\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Arts Editor\nSin\nWhere?

This is an ambitious\ntarget, and many have questioned the\nviability of the project, with the ESA\nacknowledging in their announcement\nthat \u201cit will be a close-run thing to have\nit ready, tested, and working by 2024\u201d.\nThis is not where the ambition ends \u2013\nNASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine,\nhas said that after this mission, the plan\nis to establish \u201ca long-term presence on\nthe Moon by the end of the decade\u201d.\nThe ESA will be initially involved\nwith the \u201cLunar Gateway\u201d, a space\nstation that will orbit around the moon\nand allow for more frequent lunar\nexploration. The ESA will supply service\nmodules that provide the crew with air,\nwater and electricity on their journey to\nthe Gateway on NASA\u2019s Orion space-craft. They will also deliver modules to\nthe Gateway itself, including a pressur-ised living area called the I-Hab and a\nmodule for refuelling and communications with Earth.\nDuring the Artemis Programme, the\nESA and other international partners\nwill land robotic equipment on the\nmoon\u2019s surface to take samples and\nconduct experiments, in preparation for the arrival of astronauts\nat the lunar south pole. Once\nArtemis-III is under-way, the ESA will\nsupport the\nastronauts\nlanding\non the\nmoon\nby providing\ncom-munica-tions with\nthe Lunar\nPathfinder satellite. The contract for the\nbuilding of this satellite has been awarded to the UK company, Surrey Satellites\nTechnology.\nWhile the UK space agency is\nstill part of the ESA,\nthe UK\u2019s involvement in\nProject Artemis goes\nbeyond the\nESA/NASA\nagreement. This\nweek, the UK Space\nAgency, along with\npartners in Australia, Canada,\nItaly, Japan,\nLuxembourg,\nand\nthe\nUAE,\nalso\nannounced the signing of the \u201cArtemis\nAccords\u201d. These are a set of principles\nwhich will guide future exploration of\nspace. Science Minister Amanda Solloway said that the agreement \u201cunderlines\nour commitment to strengthening the\nUK\u2019s role in the global space sector\u201d.\nGiven the current political climate and\nthe ongoing negotiations about the\nUK\u2019s exit from the European Union, it\nis not surprising to see the UK Space\nAgency attempting to separate itself\nfrom the ESA and establish itself as its\nown global power in space exploration.\nThe Artemis programme, though\nambitious and expensive, is an exciting\nprospect for the future of space explo-ration. If the programme succeeds in\nlanding the first woman on the moon,\nit will no doubt inspire a generation of\nyoung women to become interested in\nouter space and science. The project will\ninvolve more international collaboration\nthan NASA has seen since the construction of the International Space Station.\nIf it succeeds, it could be the gateway for\nhumanity\u2019s exploration of space, further\nthan we have ever gone before.\nCONTINUED\n2024\ngoal to get the\nfirst woman on\nthe moon\nFurther evidence that oil company ExxonMobil\nmisled the public on climate change\nHarvard University researchers\nhave responded to the oil and gas\ngiant\u2019s criticism of their 2017 peer-re-viewed analysis, which showed that ExxonMobil has misled the public about\nthe severity of climate change.\nIn 2017, Geoffrey Supran and\nNaomi Oreskes from the Department\nof the History of Science at Harvard\nUniversity published their analysis of\nExxonMobil\u2019s climate change communications between 1977 and 2014. They\nperformed \u201cempirical document-by-doc-ument textual content analysis of 187\nclimate change communications from\nExxonMobil\u201d. Their analysis found that\nthe publicly available communications\nproduced by the company, and in par-ticular, the editorial-style advertisements\nthey released (referred to as \u201cadvertorials\u201d in their research), contained expressions of doubt about climate change\nbeing real and caused by human activity.\nWhile 83% of peer-reviewed papers\nand 80% of internal documents produced by ExxonMobil acknowledged\nthat climate change is \u201creal and human-caused\u201d, just 12% of advertorials\nacknowledged this. In fact, 81% of\nthese advertisements expressed doubt\nabout anthropogenic\nglobal warming. The\nresearchers concluded\nthat, while ExxonMobil was contributing\nto advancing climate\nscience, they were\nsimultaneously promoting doubt in the\npublic mind about the\nexistence of climate\nchange.\nIn the same academic journal where\nthis study was pub-lished, ExxonMobil President Vijay\nSwarup published a criticism of Supran\nand Oreskes\u2019s research. Swarup claimed\nthat the analysis only assessed a small\nsubset of the available advertorials in the\nNew York Times, and that the original\npublication \u201cobscured the separateness\nof\u2026 Exxon and Mobil\u201d, who are technically two corporations.\nSupran and Oreskes have now published a response\nto these crit-icisms, and\nhave in fact\nshowed that the\nExxonMobil\u2019s\ncommunications\nwere even more\nmisleading than\nthey initially\nthought. They\nhave rebutted\nboth of Supran\u2019s\nkey criticisms,\nnoting that only\n4% or less of all advertorials published\nby Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp in\nthe New York Times had any discussion\nof anthropogenic climate change, and\nexplaining that the original study explicitly attributed each of the advertorials\nassessed to Exxon, Mobil or ExxonMobil Corp. The new research shows that\nExxon and Mobil both separately misled\nthe public, and continued to do so\nfollowing their merger into ExxonMobil\nCorp.\nSupran and Oreske also note that\nfollowing the publication of their initial\nstudy, they became aware of additional\nrelevant articles (which were highlighted by Swarup in his criticisms). Their\nnew research shows that these additional materials actually strengthen the\nargument that Exxon, Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp misled the public, and\nprovide greater evidence that all three\ncompanies published communications\nexpressing doubt about anthropogenic\nclimate change.\nLily Shepherd Science Writer\nPhoto credits: NASA\n\u201c\n81% OF\nEXXONMOBIL\u2019S\nADS EXPRESSED\nDOUBT ABOUT\nANTHROPOGENIC\nGLOBALWARMING.\n\n"

To explain why we\u2019re going back\nto 2013.\nLong ago, in a time when listening to\ndance music didn\u2019t seem so depressing,\nDisclosure released an absolute slaper-ooney of a dance album, an instant clas-sic. Settle launched onto the scene seven\nyears ago and in one fell swoop the Lawrence brothers (Guy and Howard) landed themselves into the dance record hall\nof fame. Whether they wanted it or not,\nSettle was a double-edged sword; setting\nthe bar unbelievably high. The high bar\nended up being bad for both the brothers and their fans.\nWhile they didn\u2019t shit the bed with\ntheir second project, Caracal, it left a\nbitter taste in the mouths of many fans.\nCaracal was a pop record, unexpected to\nmost. We should have seen it coming I\nsuppose, but I guess that\u2019s easier to say\nin hindsight. The Lawrence brothers\nhad long admitted a love for pop music,\noften telling of their affection for artists\nlike Jamie Woon. After all, it was their\nsignature sound mixed with traditional\npop song writing that gave many of the\nmajor hits on Settle their widespread\nappeal and accessibility (\u201cLatch\u201d, \u201cF For\nYou\u201d,\u201cHelpMeLoseMyMind\u201d).Unfortunately, their breach into pop territory\nwas not met with overwhelming praise\nfrom critics.\nI mention all of this for two reasons.\nOne \u2013 the Lawrence brothers are actually fantastic at making pop music (if you\nignore their worst ever song \u201cMagnets\u201d)\nand I don\u2019t think they get the credit they\ndeserve from critics. Two \u2013 it helps explain Disclosure\u2019s very clear return to\ntheir dance style, for better or for worse.\nLet\u2019s start off on a positive note. ENERGY has some absolute killer tracks.\n\u201cLavender\u201d is sexy and chique. When\nit becomes safe to, you\u2019re going to want\nthis to get on the dancefloor and engage\nin some consensual grinding.\n\u201cMy High\u201d is Disclosure\u2019s slowthai\nbanger. Similar to slowthai tracks like\n\u201cDoorman\u201d and \u201cDeal Wiv It\u201d, but with\nthe unique Disclosure sound. This track\nis full of tongue\u2019n\u2019cheek lines and has an\ninfectiously aggressive, on-edge atmos-phere.\nThe title track\n\u201cENERGY\u201d is the\ncrown jewel of this\nalbum. Layers of\npercussive rhythms\nbuild until there are\nno breaks, the space\naround begins to\nvibrate, and the air\nbecomes saturated\nwith energy (seri-ously couldn\u2019t think\nof a better word).\nThis is a dance\ntrack through-and-through, ENERGY\nneeded so much\nmoreofwhatthistrackhastooffer.Why\ndid we only get one track like this??\nBesides these top tunes, there are\nonly two other stand-out tracks that\nare worth anyone\u2019s time: \u201cDouha (Mali\nMali)\u201d and \u201cce n\u2019est pas\u201d. Both are interesting because they are legitimate developments of Disclosure\u2019s signature style\nby using the influence of different cul-tures. However, they lack the momentum and presence of the best tracks to\nreally draw attention.\nSadly, the remainder of the tracks on\nthe album are mediocre. To be fair it\u2019s\nprobablymoreaccuratetodescribethem\nas underwhelming rather than medio-cre. I\u2019ll let you decide which is worse.\nI\u2019m not saying that Disclosure haven\u2019t\ntried to develop. All I\u2019m saying is, you\ncan\u2019t put an extra layer of frosting on a\nseven-year-old cake and convince me it\u2019s\nnot stale. So many tracks on ENERGY\nhave the same sound as those on Settle\nexcept with added bells and whistles\n(both metaphorical and literal in this\ncase).Tonameafew:\u201cWatchYourStep\u201d,\n\u201cWho Knew?\u201d, \u201cReverie\u201d, and \u201cBirthday\u201d.\nActually, \u201cBirthday\u201d is in a class of its\nown, and not a good one. \u201cBirthday\u201d is\ntheir new worst song. On first listen, I\nlegitimately questioned whether or not I\nwas still a fan of Disclosure. Harsh criti-cism, but one that I now levy at Kehlani\nand Syd. Guys\u2026 the lyrics on \u201cBirthday\u201d\nare hot garbage.\nAll I have to say about the two interludes in the album is this: if you\u2019re\ngoing to include an interlude in your\nalbum make sure\nit\u2019s both a good\npalate cleanser\nfor the following\ntrack and make\nit an interesting\ntangent that appears to develop\nideas or themes\nyou\u2019re using.\nDon\u2019t use it as\nan opportunity to flex your\nproducing skills\nby wedging in a\ngenre that has no\nreason being in\nyour album *cough* Thinking \u2019Bout You\n*cough*, and don\u2019t make it as boring as\na lo-fi beat compilation *cough* Fractal\n*cough*.\nDespite the criticisms I\u2019ve hurled at\nthisalbumitcannotbesaidthatitisbad.\nThere are some great highs amongst the\nlows, and even the lows can be viewed\ndifferently. As stated before, you could\nlook at the poorer elements as either mediocre or underwhelming, and there\u2019s\na big difference between the two. The\ncritical reception to this album has been\nreasonably varied, most landing it in a\nrange from 3-5 stars, which is pretty in-consistent. If this is your first Disclosure\nalbum or you\u2019re not a regular listener,\nI\u2019msureyou\u2019rehavingablast,youshould\nbe. ENERGY is a fun album to listen to.\nThis album makes me want to throw\nsome shapes and get back to the dancefloor (excluding \u201cBirthday\u201d of course).\nThough when I do return, I can say with\ncertainty that I\u2019ll be reaching for a lot of\nother albums and not this one.\nDisclosure...

Any\nfantastic sports moment is appreciated\nby all people, regardless if they play\nthe sport or if they even know about\nsports. I have many moments that I have\nadmired, that I remember watching and\nfeeling so happy that I got the opportunity to even be a part of. But one that\nalways comes to mind is in basketball,\ngame 6, NBA final, 2013: Miami Heat\nvs San Antonio Spurs. As a little back\nstory, I started supporting Miami Heat\nin 2010, when I was lucky enough to\nwatch a live game when traveling to the\nUS. It was a completely surreal experience for 10 year old me who had started\nplaying basketball that year. These people were huge! They could reach the net\nlike it was no effort and could cross the\ncourt in seconds when it felt never-end-ing to me. They had these insane tricks\nthat they made look so easy. The Heat at\nthat time also had the \u201ctriple threat\u201d \u2013\nChris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, and Lebron\nJames. Every year since then, I\u2019ve supported them whole heartedly, and was\none of the designated Heat fans among\nLakers and Celtics fans in my school. I\nwas living in Ukraine at the time of the\ngame, so I had to wake up at 5am to go\ninto my living room and set up ESPN.\nMy family friends stay the night, who\nwere also Heat fans, and who, luckily,\nhad the ESPN\nsubscription.\nWe had set up\nthe couch to\nturn into a pull\nout bed and we\nall huddled on\nit with bowls of\ncereal (eventu-ally, we would\nhave to go to\nschool). I was\nso nervous, the\nSpurs had been\nup the entire\ntime, always at\nleast a 1 game\nlead, and they\nwere predicted\nto win this game, but we had hope. By\nthe start of the fourth quarter, however,\nwe had lost that hope. The Spurs were\nup a few points and it just didn\u2019t look\npossible for Miami Heat to keep going.\nWe were all packed and getting ready\nfor school, disappointed that this will\nbe a loss for Miami and preparing to\nhear all my friends give their \u201ccondolences\u201d. The moment came with about 8\nseconds left on the clock. Miami Heat\nhad managed to\nget quite close,\nscoring many\npoints throughout\nthe 4th quarter.\nWith 8 seconds\nleft, they were\ndown 92-95. This\nbasically meant\nthey needed one\nthree pointer to\ntie the game and\nput them into\nover-time. This\nwas the last play\nof the game, and\nLebron James was\ngoing to take the\n3-point shot. We\nall held our breath as Lebron went up\nfor the shot. The second it hit the rim\nand missed, we all accepted defeat.\nSomehow, out of nowhere, Chris Bosh\nhad gotten the rebound in a sea of Spurs\nplayers and passed it out to Ray Allen.\nRay Allen took a step back and sunk\na three-pointer to tie the game. The\nbuzzer rang seconds after and the game\nwent into overtime. We, and the crowd,\nwent absolutely crazy! At this point, we\nstill didn\u2019t know if Miami were going to\nwin the game in overtime, but we knew\nthat was one of the best basketball plays\nwe had ever seen. The dread of seeing\nLebron James miss the shot followed\nby the completely shock of Ray Allen\nmaking it felt completely surreal. It was\na one-in-a-million chance that it would\nhave ended like that. In the end, Miami\nhad managed to win in overtime and\nwent on to game 7, where they managed\nto beat the Spurs and become the 2013\nChampions. We all think the thrill and\nadrenaline from that shot is what led\nthem to win overtime and Game 7.

    "content": "With a cast as talented as this, and a screenwriter\nas experienced as Sorkin (the progenitor of\n\u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth\u201d in A Few Good Men), I\nwent in expecting good things from this movie. Despite the hiccups caused by COVID-19\u2014which prevented it having a large cinema release, causing Netflix\nto step in to distribute\u2014the film is thoroughly enter-taining. It tells the story of the Chicago 7, a group of\nanti-Vietnam War protestors charged with crossing\nstate lines and inciting violence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Eddie Redmayne as\nTom Hayden (leader of the SDS), Mark Rylance and\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt as the heads\nof the defence and prosecution re-spectively, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen\nII as Bobby Seale were enthralling\u2014\nbringing even more colour to an\nalready colourful trial. (Sacha Baron\nCohen\u2019s performance often took me\nout of the action. His role as Yippie\nleader, Abbie Hoffman, appeared to\namount to saying very cliched hippie\nthings, making him come off as a bit\nhumdrum.)\nSorkin lets the trial unfold in flashes,\nutilising both jumps ahead in time\nand flashbacks narrated by members of the Chicago 7. This gives us\nan all-access look at the cracks in\nthe legal system\u2014from particular\njurors being suspiciously discharged\n(much to the convenience of the\nprosecution), to the defence counsel squabbling with the Chicago 7\n(when they were not busy squabbling with themselves). As the trial\u2019s\npublicity builds, the politics and\ntemperament of each participant\nbecomes less extractable from what\nis seen as right and wrong. The\nnature of protest and the fallibility\nof the justice system are shown at\ntheir extremes; and, up until the\nvery end, we sit questioning what\nrewards are worth contending for\nif they have to be collected through\nviolence.\nA Captivating Courtroom Drama\nFree Film of the Week: The Deer Hunter\nEditor Recommends\nAfter hunting, five\nfriends head to\nWelshy\u2019s Bar in the steel-mill\ntown of Clairton, Pennsylvania, to celebrate the imminent\ndeployment of two of them\nto Vietnam\u2014Mike and Nick.\nAnother member of the group,\nJohn, begins to play Chopin\u2019s\nNocturne No. 6 on a piano\nin the corner of the room. Nobody speaks, nobody\nlooks at anything in particular. As the piece ends,\nthere is a momentary silence. The camera pans to\nMike: in his face there is a sobriety, a gratitude for his\nlittle town and for his friends\u2014an appreciation for\nthe relative banality of his life. Then the regular beat\nof a helicopter sounds, and the film cuts to carpet\nbombs obliterating a Vietnamese village. Civilians are\nmassacred. An injured woman is gunned down by the\nViet Cong, along with her child. Mike is drenched in\nblood. We are a long way from Chopin now.\nThe Deer Hunter\u2019s successes are all present in\nthis exquisite transition. Life and death, and war\nand peace, are presented in the most undecorated\nmanner, and the starkness of their contrast is made\napparent by the tenuity of the membrane separating\nthem. Indeed the larger plot\u2014of Mike (Robert De\nNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John\nSavage) integrating back into society\u2014exhibits the\nvery same interplay of opposites. Dualities are present\nthroughout. For example, when Mike goes on his first\nhunt since coming home, he hikes up into the clouds,\nand as he ascends some rock formation, gun in-hand,\na reflection follows him in the placid lake below.\nThese scenes, as impeccable as they may be, are\nsurrounded by unending gristle. I don\u2019t know how\nCimino would justify the 40 minute long wedding\nsequence. Perhaps he\u2019d say to the detractors that the\nfilm \u2018just wouldn\u2019t be the same without it\u2019\u2014I suspect many would reply: \u2018good\u2019. A long movie is not, a\npriori, a good movie, and it can be easy for directors\nto mistake self-indulgence or ill-discipline for vision.\nSo what unites all the great long movies? Well, it is\nan encompassing quality; they entirely arrest a time,\nemotion or idea. I\u2019m not convinced The Deer Hunter fully succeeds in that regard. While the game of\nRussian roulette serves as an effective symbol for the\nnature of killing in war, and the final scene serves as\na nice ironic jab at the nature of war, the soul of the\nmovie is missing, and it doesn\u2019t give you a whole lot\nto chew on as the great epics of cinema do.\nThe Deer Hunter\u2019s problems by no means lessen\nthe scenes I lauded before. On top of those scenes,\nVilmos Zsigmond\u2019s cinematography is faultless, and\nthe Cavatina theme by Stanley Myers is beautifully\napt. Then there are the performances\u2014all coalescing into effectively one character: the common man\nfrom Clairton. Each performance feeds into the\nnext: Christopher Walken\u2019s Academy Award winning\nperformance being complemented by the equally engaging Robert De Niro, who is in turn made better by\nMeryl Streep\u2019s enigmatic presence as Linda and John\nSavage\u2019s emotional performance as Steven. The greatness of the performances are certainly not limited by\nthe screen time of the actors; you need only watch\nJohn Cazale as Stan. Cazale filmed while he was living\nwith terminal cancer, and never got to see the work in\nits final form. In the few scenes he has, as the runt of\nthe group\u2014never fully fitting in, always chasing girls,\noften being the butt of a joke or the target of a slap\u2014\nhis acting is spellbinding, the work of a man who\nknows it will be his last. Is The Deer Hunter without\nfaults? No. Is it one of the great American epics? I\u2019d\nsay no. But if you can withstand\nthese flaws, along with the film\u2019s\nobvious bloatedness, The Deer\nHunter will be sure to reward\nyou with flashes of sheer mag-nificence.\nReviewed by Oliver Weir\nOliver Weir Film Editor\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\nDirectedby: Michael Cimino\nYearof Release: 1978\nStarring: Robert De Niro; Christopher Walken; John Cazale; John Savage; Meryl Streep\nDirectedby: Aaron Sorkin\nStarring: Eddie Redmayne; Sacha Baron Cohen; Mark Rylance; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; Joseph Gordon-Levitt\nThe Deer Hunter\nClassic of the Week...\nThree Colours: Blue\nThe first of\nKie\u015blowski\u2019s Three\nColours trilogy.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n6 Felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nImperial Athletes launch: can one size fit all?\nWhat are your clubs saying?\nSpeaking to different clubs has shown\nthat there are huge differences between the way different clubs have received support to adapt to the new\nstructure that they were all enrolled in.\nIC Hockey\nWereyou preparedforthetransition\ninto the Imperial Athletes system?\nYes, we\u2019d been aware of the work done\nover the past few years concerning the\nlaunch and knew it would come at some\npoint. It was confirmed during last year\nthatwewouldmoveintoIAthistermand\nwe were given confirmation during the\nsummer, so we had time to prepare our\nactivities to run within the IA structure.\nDoes the Imperial Athletes structure appeal to you in the long term?\nDefinitely, even though the transition\nhasn\u2019t been perfectly smooth and we are\nstill learning about the details and these\nare updated regularly, we are optimistic\nthat in the long term this will provide\na one-stop shop to get support to deal\nwith club finances, club admin and to\ntalk to staff or sport executives that can\ngive us more advice when we need it.\nThe exact details of how finances will\nwork this term aren\u2019t perfectly clear\nyet but we\u2019re confident that in the long\nterm the Imperial Athletes structure\nwill provide a cheaper overall experience\nfor our members and will make it easier to run the club throughout the year.\nHas Imperial Athletes provided\nvaluable support to your teams?\nImperial Athletes so far have been great\nat supporting our teams. We\u2019ve had\ntransport for our team trainings sorted\nand training has been running smooth-ly. The launch of Imperial Leagues is\nalso very beneficial for our members as\nit will keep our members active and the\nmatches will promote the club for anyone wishing to join Hockey. Getting\npeople training together was a concern\nfor us, especially for our Mens\u2019 1st team:\nwe\u2019re glad Imperial Athletes have made\nit possible for them to train together as\na team with their coach. Whilst we\u2019re\nhoping their competitions resume in\nWinter term we\u2019re currently focused on\nensuring the team remains bonded.\nHarry Reynolds Hockey Chair\nCaitlin Edgar Hockey Honorary Secretaty\nIllustration by: Yingying Fang\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\nsports were supposed to integrate the\nstructure.\nOnce this phase had been completed the Sports Hub (now Imperial Athletes)wouldexpandandwouldbeopen\nto other clubs, namely Individual and\nMartial Arts clubs in 2020-2021. Due\nto the pandemic and a reorganising of\nthe ICU team, the transition fell behind schedule last academic year. With\nstaff being furloughed and many activities at a standstill, less progress was\nachieved than desired towards the end\nof the academic year meaning that Imperial Athletes was not ready to launch\nand had to be postponed.\nOut of concern for some clubs\u2019\nability to cope financially and deliver\nactivities to their members in this pe-riod, Imperial Athletes decided to disregard the initial timeline and include\nadditional clubs in the structure with\nvery little notice and guidance. This\nhas put clubs under a lot of stress and\nhas created a void between the two par-ties, which is the opposite of what was\nhoped to be achieved by all the hard\nworkfrombothsidesoverthepastyears\nand months. Talking to DPCS Ross\nUnwin, the main considerations were\nthat BUCS might not be running and\nthat in-person sports activities would\nlook very different due to restrictions.\nAs government guidelines are likely to\nchange frequently, Imperial Athletes\nwanted to be able to offer all students\nthe best sports experience attainable\nduring this period. Unwin admitted\nthat the scheme was not yet ready but\ntold Felix that he felt it was the best to\nlaunch the incomplete version and to\njump in with \u201cboth feet\u201d.\nImperial athletes have had some\nsuccesses with the launch of intramural leagues led by Will Hollyer\u2019s team\nat Move Imperial. With matches on\nWednesdays this replaces BUCS and\nLUSL league matches for the time be-ing, providing a competitive and sports\natmosphere for students.\nHowever, the policy that has drawn\ncriticism from students is the change to\nhow club membership is purchased. In\nprevious years, clubs were free to set the\nprice of their own\nmembership and\nto spend membership income\nas they wished.\nClubs also received a Union\ngrant to support\ncore activities.\nSmaller clubs\nalso do not have\nregular fixtures\nor expensive and\ndistant training\nsessions meaning\nthat they feel they\nwillloseoutunder\nthe new model as\ntheir normal membership price is far\nbelow the \u00a325 of Imperial Athletes.\nThey feel in effect that this acts as a subsidy of the larger team sports by smaller\nindividual clubs and will dissuade students from joining their clubs.\nAnother frustration with the new\nsystem is that some committees feel\nthat the new model takes power out of\ntheir hands. Ross Unwin and Imperial\nAthletes have argued, however, that the\nstructure is there to support the clubs\nin their activities and contribute to the\ndevelopment of the clubs. The sports\nexecutive, ie. club committees, ACC\ncommittee, the DPCS and DPFS are\nstill there to decide how activities are\nrun and overall the Imperial Athletes\nstructure is there to make the managing of the finances and organisation of\nthese activities easier.\nUnwin told Felix that even though\nImperial Athletes might not have got\nthebehindthescenescorrect,theywant\nto work with everyone, they want the\nproject to work and most importantly\nthey want clubs to want it to work.\nUnwin also promised that he would\nmeet in person with all dissatisfied\nclubs and would make them see how\nthe new model benefited them.\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nPolice given\naccess to test &\ntrace data\nThe world waits with bated breath\nfor a return to normality, with\nmany hopes hinged on a coronavirus\nvaccine. However, despite current\nestimates of a vaccine being approved\nby early 2021, distribution can take\nmonths meaning restrictions may not\nend until late next year. So why exactly\nare we in it for the long haul?\nThe goal of vaccination is to achieve a\nstate of herd immunity: where enough\npeople have gained immunity to a\ndisease that the disease cannot spread\nanymore, and it will eventually die off.\nHerd immunity also protects those who\ncan\u2019t get vaccinated by making it difficult for a disease to even reach them in\nthe first place. The proportion of people\nthat require immunisation for the entire\npopulation to have herd immunity\ndepends on how effectively a disease\nspreads; with COVID-19, this threshold is estimated to be around 60%.\n60% of the world\u2019s population is\nalmost 5 billion people. Getting this\nmany people vaccinated takes time and\nis made even more difficult with many\nplanes grounded due to lack of passenger air travel, which is one of the main\nnetworks utilised for pharmaceutical\ndistribution. This is complicated further\nby the requirement for the \u2018cold chain\u2019:\nthe logistics network for items that\nrequire refrigeration or freezing. While\nthe leading vaccine candidate from the\nUniversity of Oxford and AstraZeneca\nis expected to require simple refriger-ation, other leading candidates\nhave higher demands.\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna are working on vaccines that will require\nsub-zero storage,\nwith Pfizer\u2019s\nvaccine requiring temperatures of\nbelow\n-68\u00b0C.\nThis\nhas logistical conse-quences; the\ntransport and\nstorage of these\nvaccines at such low temperatures\nis costly and requires specialised\nequipment and facilities. Capacity is\nlacking not just in the global south, but\nalso in developed countries like the US\nand UK - which are ironically faring\nworse in response to the disease than\nmany countries in the global south.\nTo this end, private logistics companies such as DHL and UPS have been\ninvesting in their cold chain capacity,\nbuilding high capacity freezer farms in\nmajor cities around the world to house\nvaccines for distribution. Meanwhile,\nPfizer have taken it upon themselves\nto create a custom transport solution\nwith cold storage boxes that can\nkeep up to 5,000 vaccine doses\nat the required temperature for\n10 days without requiring external\ncooling, meaning that regular\ndistribution networks can be\nutilised. This custom solution has\na major advantage: while big cities may\nhave the necessary cold storage facilities to store tens of thousands of doses,\nsmaller towns and villages do not. The\nchallenge then is for those smaller settlements to be able to make use of the\ndoses quickly before the timer runs out.\nIt is estimated that while a vaccine\nmay be approved by early 2021, due to\nthese logistical challenges the vaccination program could take several months\nto a year. Further investments need to\nbe made in order to ensure we have the\ncapability to quickly and safely vaccinate the population so we can finally\nput this pandemic behind us.\nThe logistics of vaccine distribution\nThe effectiveness of contact tracing apps is starting to show, and\nit isn\u2019t looking positive. Each week,\nthe percentage of individuals notified\nabout a confirmed positive contact has\ndecreased, which is brings into question\nthe accuracy of the test and trace sys-tem. This failure to reach notifications\ncauses a risk of further transmission\ndue to a lack of self-isolation. Further,\nit defeats the purpose of maintaining\nan automated contact tracing scheme in\nthe first place.\nTo this end, test and trace information has been (on a case-by-case basis)\nprovided to the police. The belief is\nthat they would help ensure that those\nlegally required to self-isolate are indeed\ndoing so. Failure to meet this legal obligation may see an individual charged\nanywhere from \u00a31000 to \u00a310,000.\nSome suggest that this move to hand\ndata over to the Police might discourage\nthose looking to take a test, with MPs\nraising concerns over how police have\naccess to the data while local councils\ndo not.\nSudarshan Sreeram Tech Editor\nAnsh Bhatnagar Science Editor\nIn order to put an end to the global coronavirus pandemic, researchers\naround the world are working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to protect\nagainst COVID-19. While vaccine\nproduction usually takes multiple\nyears, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped\ntobedevelopedwithin12-18months.\nVaccine testing can be split into 5\nstages:\nPre-clinical \u2013 animal testing to see\nwhether the vaccine elicits an immune\nresponse.\nPhase I \u2013 healthy human volunteers\nto determine safety and evaluate immune response.\nPhase II \u2013 hundreds of volunteers to\nidentify correct dosage.\nPhase III \u2013 thousands of volunteers\nto confirm safety and efficacy vs. a\nplacebo.\nPhaseIV\u2013studiesonadverseeffects,\nlong-term mmunity and vaccine usage following the approval and licensing of the vaccine.\nThe WHO is currently tracking the\nprogress of over 170 candidate vac-cines; at Felix, we\u2019ve chosen 5 of the\nmost promising candidates to follow,\nso watch this space!\nNew Update: In January, Imperial\nCollege London will be starting human challenge trials, in which young,\nhealthy volunteers are deliberately\ninfected with COVID-19 in order to\nassist with the vaccine discovery pro-cess.

    "content": "FRIDAY 23RD OCTOBER 2020\n7\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nSpeaking to Sport Development\nManager James Perry about the\nlaunch has given us more insight on\nhow Imperial Arhletes is planning on\nenhancing the sports experience for\nstudents.\nPrior to the launch of Imperial\nAthletes, what was a key obstacle\nto joining sports at Imperial?\nThere are a wide range of clubs that are\nadvertised to freshers from the start of\nterm with varying memberships fees\noffering different activities. With the\nhigh costs of university and living in\nLondon, spending up to the order of\n\u00a3100 on a sports club membership is a\nbig commitment and can be daunting,\nespecially for individuals who aren\u2019t\nyet certain which club they want to\ndedicate most of their time outside\nof their degree to. Furthermore, the\nlist of different memberships and fee\nsystems from one club to another can\nbe off-putting. A key long-term goal\nfor Imperial Athletes is to make sports\ncheaper and more accessible throughout the entirety of what Imperial has\nto offer.\nHow will the launch of Imperial\nAthletes affect the support for\nperformance athletes?\nAt the moment, College is running a\nscheme to support performance athletes with scholarships, from Bronze to\nGold in accordance with the athlete\u2019s\ncompetition level. These scholarships\nprovide athlete support, mentoring,\nStrength & Conditioning, financial\nand training support. This scheme\nis led by the College so will not be\nchanging. Until now however there\nwas very little support for performance\nteams and their entries would usually\nbe capped. With Imperial Athletes the\naim is to support performance teams,\nenter all teams competing at BUCS\nPremier, Tier 1 or National championships and fund transport and accommodation for those teams.\nSome clubs have managed to find\ntheir place in the structure but\nothers haven\u2019t. Hhow do you feel\nthe incorporation of these clubs\nwill progress in the future?\nImperial Athletes is there as a structure\nto support sports clubs. With the extension of Imperial Athletes to individual and martial arts clubs there has\nbeen more work to be done to support\nall clubs of the Sports Hub equally.\nWhile we may have underestimated\nthe variance of functioning across the\nrange of sports clubs, we appreciate the\nchallenge that this variety of required\nsolutions presents and are actively\nworking on helping all clubs find their\nplace within Imperial Athletes.\nA positive outcome of this transition\nis that it has brought many clubs who\nfelt isolated in the past to feel included\nin the sports community and to enter\ndiscussions with Imperial Athletes. The\nstudent activities development team is\nmotivated to support such clubs and\nsees this as an opportunity to help\nthem take part in development plans.\nWe know that change is always diffi-cult, but we are hoping that this can be\na change for the better.\nIC Riding and Polo\nHow aware were you before September that the launch of Imperial Athletes was taking place this term?\nWe had heard of the Sports Hub during the year but had received no indication we were going to be included in it\nthis year until the week before the start\nof term and the Virtual Fair. No one\nreached out to us from IA to help us understand how we fit in, how to organise\nour activities for this term and promote\nthem to new members so we weren\u2019t\nquitesurewhatthetermwouldlooklike.\nAfter reaching out to IA we were able to\nclarify how the club would fit in within\nthe scheme and after this delay we have\nbeen able to run our sessions with limited disruptions due to this transition.\nDo you feel like the IA structure benefits your club financially?\nOur membership used to be higher than\nwhat is currently a flat fee of \u00a325. Following an increase in riding lesson prices and a reduction in membership cost\nwe\u2019ve had to reduce our subsidy per les-son. However in the long term, by working with IA to optimise the running of\ntraining and competitions, we believe\nwe can get to a point where the overall\nstudent experience is cheaper.\nDo you think IA can work in the long\nterm for Riding and Polo?\nDiscussions still need to happen to\nknow how we are going to work with IA.\nThings that are still unclear include the\nsources of income: as this is something\nIAisgoingtotackletomaketherunning\nof clubs easier, we\u2019re hoping this gets resolved quickly. As a club that has a lot of\nadmin work throughout the year, we\u2019re\nalso hoping the IA structure\nwill alleviate this stress from\nthe committee and make the\nexperience of running the\nclub less demanding. IA has\nmade substantial promises to\nus and other clubs, and while\nwe are enthusiastic about the\nnew opportunities it offers it\nremains to be seen whether\nthey will deliver on these.\nIC Pole and Aerial\nGeorgie Foot P&A Competitions Officer\nWhen preparations for the Sport Hub\nlaunch were taking place, were you\nlooking forward to being a part of it?\nWe joined the Sport sector from Arts &\nEnts a few years ago and as the launch\nwas supposed to take place over 2 years,\nwe weren\u2019t expecting to be impacted by\nit before another year. However we had\ndoubts about what it could bring to our\nclubandstillcan-not see exactly\nwhat support\nImperial Athletes can bring\nus as we simply\ndon\u2019t have the\nsame requirements to run\nour training\nand competitions as other\nclubs.\nWhen you\nwere informed\nyou would be part of IA at the beginning of term, how much support did\nyou receive to find your place within\nthe structure?\nWe were informed very close to the start\nof term that we had been moved to IA\nand weren\u2019t contacted to help us understand what it meant for us specifically.\nWhen trying to find a way to fit within\nthe scheme we were given two options:\ncommitting to the Imperial Athletes\nstructure and receiving some support\ndown the lineor claiming back the membership fees and managing our own\nfinances. No middle-ground solution\nseemed to be possible so we decided to\ngo for the second option and redistribute the \u00a325 as lessons subsidy.\nWhat were your main concerns for this\nterm and what are you\nhoping will happen in\nWinter Term?\nHaving completed our\nfinancial planning during the summer we\nwere surprised when we\nlearnt the membership\nsystem had changed. We\nfelt uneasy charging upfront \u00a325 to members\nto only be able to take\npart in online classes.\nThis contributed to our\nchoice of opting out of the scheme for\nthe time being.\nWe\u2019re hoping we can run our activities\nand local competitions next term as\nclosely as possible to previous years, with\nlittle influence from Imperial Athletes.\nPhoto by Harry Reynolds\nLily Rietbergen Riding and Polo Chair\nVita Welcome Riding and Polo VC\nTom Nottingham scoring in the Intramural Leagues\nNO ONE REACHED\nOUT TO US\nFROM IMPERIAL\nATHLETES\nTO HELP US\nUNDERSTAND\nHOW WE FIT IN\n\u201c\n\n"

We\nhere at Felix Fashion appreciate a\nconfident look and Lucy was putting it\nout in spades with an alternating print\nblock colour look. She told us that she\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t tell\u201d us who her style icon\nwas, which only made us want to know\neven more!\nDespite term having started a week\nago, this was her first time going into\nthe library and she freely admitted\nthat she might only \u201clook around and\nsee how it is\u201d. She also said that she\ndidn\u2019t know \u201cif she was allowed into\nthe library\u201d but that couldn\u2019t stop her\n- her chosen power outfit adding the\nconfidence to cross boundaries and\nbreak some rules!\nHaving been here for two years al-ready, Lucy is a major figure at Imperial, a third year Medical Bioscience stu-dent, she is even better known on the\nrugby pitch. President of the Women\u2019s\nRugby team she is packing serious\npunch. Avoid making her angry!\nHer jumper was from Goose and\nGander, a small indie fashion label set\nup by two primary school friends that\nspecialises in unisex hoodies, shirts,\nand sweatshirts, and was a birthday\npresent. Clearly we all need friends\nand relatives like Lucy\u2019s to buy us\npresents!\nHer trousers are from Urban Outfitters, a neat straight leg trouser, easy\nto look smart in with a nice top or\nstylishly casual when paired with a\njumper.\nHer bag contained a laptop \u201cin case\n[she] get[s] into the library\u201d and her\nrugby kit. Her shoes were classic New\nBalance, well-worn and fun.\nHer blonde hair was scrapped back\ninto a fun mid ponytail that gave her\na casual yet chic look that the average\nImperial student struggles to embody.\nHow to look like me\nThe brands:\nSweater: Goose and Gander\nIMPERIAL\u2019S BEST DRESSED\nIt\u2019s become apparent that protective face masks are\nstaying with us for the long run. Could they become\nthe new must-have fashion accessory? Face masks are\nnow an everyday essential, in addition to your phone,\nkeys and wallet. You can never leave the house without\nthe all-important face mask. Giving us access to enter\nshops and use public transport, face masks\nare there to protect ourselves and oth-ers. However, there is perhaps potential to express ourselves beyond\nconventional clothing items. Designer brands such as Off-White,\nTory Burch, and Missoni have all\nreleased their latest face mask de-signs. Not to mention the appearance\nof Billie Eilish in a Gucci face covering at the\nGrammy Awards earlier this year.\n(It is important to add that these masks are probably\nnot CDC approved! So always check before you buy!)\nWhere does this lead us? Could it become the norm\nto start matching your face mask to your outfit? Or\neven base your entire outfit off the initial face mask?\nI\u2019d like to think that the anti-maskers out there will\nstop viewing face masks as an inconvenience, and rather view them with the potential they have. It\nmay feel unimaginable, but masks may\nbecome the next functional fashion accessory. There is, however,\na fine line that the \u2018fashion mask\u2019\ntreads on. Should luxury brands be\nable to make a profit from what is\ndeemed a necessity to survival?\nEarlier this year, the fast fashion brand\nBoohoo was slammed by NHS staff for selling\n\u00a35 \u2018useless\u2019 fashion masks, and the Union of Shop,\nDistributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) deemed the\nmasks as \u2018scandalous\u2019. In response, Boohoo donated\nthousands of scrubs, masks and gowns to NHS staff.\nThere are independent retailers selling masks with a\nmoreconsciousapproach.Forexample,London-based\nFlorence Bridge is donating her profits to the Fuel Our\nFrontline charity, and British brand, Lavender Hill\nClothing, donates masks to the Katherine Low Settlement charity, helping those vulnerable in Battersea.\nBoth brands have made it clear that they do not wish\nto profit from the COVID pandemic and have instead\ntaken a charitable approach. I\u2019d like to think that many\nother brands will follow this initiative, in order to contribute to those affected and help provide affordable\nbut also protective face masks.\nFuture \u2013 Mask ON\nElizabeth Tong Fashion Editor\nLucy Hamer\nSpotted by Calum Drysdale Felix Editor-in-chief\nwearing:\nNonchalance is the new\nblack\nCalum Drysdale Felix Editor-in-chief\nTrousers: Urban Outfitters\nShoes: New Balance\nCredits: Original Photo/Calum D\nCredits: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n31\nIndigenous leader in the TIME 100 List\nNemonte Nemquino, leader of\nthe Waorani in Ecuador, has\nbeen named by Time Magazine in the\n2020 list of the Top 100 Most Influential People in the world.\nRaised in the traditional Waorani\ncommunity of Nemonpare, with a brief\nperiodatamissionaryschool,Nemonte\nwent on to become the first-ever female\nleader of the indigenous group (the\nWaorani of Pastaza) and co-founder\nof the organisation Ceibo Alliance.\nHer leadership is helping to protect\nthe lands of her community against exploitation from oil extraction, and she\nis showing what true guardianship of\nour ecosystems is.\nIn 2012, the Ecuadorian government\ncarried out a consultation of lands including those of the Waorani territory.\nYet, they only presented the potential\nlocal economic benefits of the planned\noil extractions to the local communi-ties, and they did not ask for consent\nfrom the local people. It is required in\nEcuadorian and international law that\nthey ask for consent from the community and make explicit the possible\nnegative consequences of the extrac-tion. However, post-consultation, the\ngovernment started to split up sections\nof the Amazon (including the Waorani\nterritory) which would be put up for\nauctiontotheinternationalcommunity\nfor auction with aims of oil extraction.\nIn 2018, the Ecuadorian government reduced the amount of Amazonian land up for oil auction, removing\nthe Waorani territory. However, this\ndoes not mean that the community is\nsafe from future extractive activities\naccording to the community\u2019s lawyer,\nLina Maria Espinosa; \u2018this territory is\nthreatened by extractive activities, and\nthe perspective of a Western world that\nignores and denies interculturality and\nthe relationship of these peoples with\ntheir territory\u2019.\nThe Waorani people have responded to this severe lack of protection of\nIndigenous lands by starting a petition\nto gather international support and by\ntaking the government to court to sue\nthem for not properly consulting with\nthem before. This action is not just for\nthe Waorani people and their lands,\nbut for the whole Amazonia; an overwhelmingly rich ecosystem of intertwined networks of life that are every\nday contaminated by industry purely\nfor economic gain, causing detrimental\nhealth impacts and displacements of local communities.\nOn April 26th 2019, the Waorani\nwon their case. The court ruled that the\nEcuadorian government could not use\ntheir territory for oil exploration without the prior consent of the communi-ty. In an interview with The New Yorker,Nemontesays,\u2018Thecourtrecognised\nthat the government violated our right\nto live free and make our own decisions\nabout our territory and self-determination\u2019.\nThe Waorani are not the first Indigenous group to win a case against the\ngovernment of Ecuador. In 2018 the\nIndigenous Kofan community won\ntheir case against fraudulent mining\nactivities in their territory. These wins\nare a win for all. For life and beings and\necosystems.\nUnder Nemonte\u2019s leadership, her\ncommunity managed to protect hundreds of thousands of acres of rainfor-est. Yet, we must not expect this work\nto be done by those who suffer the\nmost from the Western industry and\nexploitation. We must step up and support these communities to reject the\nexploitative nature of the extractive\nindustry that our Western cultures continue to demand and invest in.\nI urge you all to read Nemonte\u2019s letter to the Western world. It is accessible\non: www.amazonfrontlines.org.\nBeing an environmentalist is a death\nsentence depending on where you are\nEnvironmental activists all over the\nworld stand and fight for the future\nof the planet, in a most courageous and\nselfless act, putting themselves at risk of\nthreats, imprisonment, and even death.\nThe number of incidents is particularly\nworrying in South America where there\nis such high biodiversity but the people\nprotecting this and their lands are often\nviolently attacked.\nA report from \u2018Tierra de Resistentes\u2019\nin 2019 highlights that Indigenous\npeople face a higher risk of violent attack for opposing extractive industries\nsuch as mining and logging. This report also states that over 10 years, there\nhave been more than 1300 attacks on\nenvironmental advocates across seven\ncountries in South America and those\ntargeted are considered to be \u2018anti-development\u2019 or \u2018unpatriotic\u2019.\nIn addition to these stark figures,\nthe 2018 report from the organisation\nGlobal Witness found that 3 people per\nweek were killed for being environmental guardians, activists or protectors.\nFurthermore, this organisation highlights that not every case is reported, so\nthe number could be much higher.\nThe most dangerous region for environmentalists is South America, but in\n2018 the country with the most deaths\nof environmentalists was the Philippines. According to the national environmentalist coalition in the Philippines, the mining sector is particularly\ndangerous. Those who are openly critical of the operations of mining companies are often bullied and threatened.\nThe Philippine army has listed various\nenvironmentalists as insurgent commu-nists, and with this categorisation, the\narmy can detain, interrogate or arrest\nthem. Additionally, the Philippines has\na law in which businesses can request\nsupport from the government if they\nfeel threatened. Industry uses this to\ncriminalise and intimidate the defenders of the environment.\nThe global trend is that the planet\u2019s\necosystemsanditspeopleprotectorsare\nunder severe threat. We are seeing more\nand more interventions of environmentalist action by police or armed forces\nas more environmental protections are\nremoved from legislation around the\nworld.\nYou can support the indigenous people and their territories too by making\ndonations to organisations such as the\nRainforest Action Network, Amazon\nFrontlines, the Ceibo Alliance, and\nWahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia.\nYou can also advocate for climate and\nenvironmental justice by joining Extinction Rebellion and Divest Imperial.\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nFlora Dickie Sustainability Editor\nNemonte Nemquino, leader of the Waorani in Ecuador\nCredit: Amazonfrontlines\n\n"
