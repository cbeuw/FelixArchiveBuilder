The latter does\nnot refer to questionably\nfully clothed men standing alongside Imperial\u2019s\nanswer to Victoria\u2019s\nSecret models but rather\nfun and entertaining\nmoments throughout the\nshow.\nC\nalling on the\ntalent of small\ndesigners, and\nby summoning\nthe model that lives in\neach and every Imperial\nstudent, the ICFS fashion show was an overall\nsuccess. This charity\nevent raised money for\nClientEarth. Some of\n...and\nthe sexy!\nThe fabulous bold patterns\nby Kwame Koranteng\nwere among the best\nlooks of the night. Contrasting with the block\ncoloured waistcoat helped\nensure the patterns were\neffective without overpowering the look.\nThis piece which formed\npart of a more extensive\nlingerie line by Nearer\nthe Moon was one of the\nhighlights. The different textures and rising\ntowards the neck eleve-taed the simple lingerie\nto something special.\nCritisism can be made\nabout this entire walk,\nnot because it was \u201ca bit\nriske\u201d as your aunt Karen\nwould say, but rather becuase of the men standing\nalongside them in an almost voyeuristic way. In\nfuture, keeping a balance\nwill help stop perpetuating sexist conotations.\nThe elmer the elephant-es-que colourful trousers\nare fun and stylish at\na stretch however the\npom-poms top is deeply unsettling. Maybe try\npipe cleaners next time!\nThis overall look was actually extremly innovative\nhowever the shear material used at crotch level confused the flow of the outfit\ncausing a disconnect between the top and bottom.\nOther looks which used\nthe same materials were\neffective but this one, especially with the transparent window, didn\u2019t\nwork. Not sure about the\nloo roll headpiece either...\nMuch like the pom-poms, the aesthetics did\nnot sit well with me. The\nmake-up and hair here,\nas well as a fierce look\non the model almost\ndsitract you from this.\nThe theme of the show was\nloosely followed through\nwith moments like this\nBillie Jean pose as well\nas some fun walks with\nBeyonc\u00e9 booming in the\nbackground. While some\nmodels kept straight faces,\nsome broke their character and couldn\u2019t help lip-sync a little. These were\nsome of the most joyous\nmoments of the show\nand maybe something to\nbe encouraged in future.\nEventually, some of\nthe sexiest men on campus did strip down and\nwalk the walk restoring the gender balance.\nSpecial guests the Imperielles and Funkology\nperformed as well. These\nwere great additions and\nelevated the whole show.\nA special mention has to\nbe made to the dancers\nin Funkology, wow, they\nreally stole the show!\n\n"

The exhibition\ntakes place 70 years on\nfrom the \u2018Touchstone\u2019\nweekends that began\nplace at Silwood campus\nin 1950, which featured\ndiscussions on ethics, phi-losophy, art and design,\nand psychology.\nThe exhibition will\nfeature events such as\ntalks on the future of\nmusic, concerts in collaboration with the Blyth\nCentre, and a visit to\nSilwood campus to get\nback in touch with the\nTouchstone origins.\nIt will also feature\na project generated by\nthe StudentShapers pro-gramme, as part of the\nHorizons Change Makers\nindependent project.\nThe projects created by\nstudents will be on display,\nand will focus on human\nsustainable development\nor environmental issues.\nThe exhibition was\ninstigated by the Director\nof the Centre for Culture,\nLanguages, and Communication, Dr. Roberto\nTrotta, a theoretical\ncosmologist at Imperial.\nThe CCLC is the hub of\nthe Horizons programme,\nwhich enables students to\ntake courses in non-STEM\nsubjects in topics as wide\nas creative writing or\npsychology.\nOn why he was inspired\nto create the exhibition,\nDr. Trotta said:\n\u201cHumanities are vital\nfor students; it puts their\ndiscipline into the broader\nsocietal context of the\nworld around them today.\nIt develops critical and\ncreative thinking, as well\nas communication skills\nand the ability to deal with\na broad range of situations\nwhich don\u2019t always have\n\u2018black and white\u2019, \u2018right\nor wrong\u2019 answers like\nSTEM.

The Science\nCommunication Group,\nwhich hosts the only\nnon-STEM or Business\ncourse at Imperial (the\nMSc in Science Communication), was introduced\nin the 1990s.\nThe next step will be\nthe I-Explore modules\nbeing introduced to the\nCollege. These will make\nit compulsory for students\nto take alternative courses\noutside of their specific\ndegrees, which will\ncount for credit \u2013 rather\nthan it being optional\nin Horizons and only\ncounting towards degrees\non a department-by-de-partment basis.\nDr. Trotta said of the\nexhibition: \u201cWe wanted to\nuse the 70th anniversary\nto look back at our past,\nbut also as a springboard\nfor our future. Bringing\npurely humanities\ncourses, which are under\npressure across the\ncountry, to a STEM university like Imperial, and\nhaving College leadership\nrecognise the value it\nbrings, is very reassuring\nthat we can have the best Dr. Roberto Trotta // Thomas Angus\nS\nimone Buitendijk,\nImperial College\u2019s\nVice Provost\n(Education), will\nbe departing the College\nand beginning a new\nrole at the head of Leeds\nUniversity for the next academic year.

The LTS will\nshape how education at\nthe College evolves over\nthe next several years,\nand has already delivered\nfunding for projects such\nas \u2018active learning\u2019lecture\ntheatres in Blackett and\nthe innovative \u2018Chemical\nKitchen\u2019 course in Chemistry.\nHer appointment was\napproved by Leeds\u2019\nCouncil, their governing\nbody, after a unanimous\nrecommendation by\na panel consisting of\nvarious Council and\nSenate members from the\nuniversity.\nDavid Gray, who heads\nthe panel, said in a Leeds\nUniversity statement:\n\u201c\"She has a clear vision\nfor how research and\neducation should work\nin tandem in a global\nuniversity with strong\ncivic roots; an impressive\nrecord of institutional\nchange management; and\nan exemplary grasp of the\nmoral purpose of higher\neducation, particularly in\nrelation to diversity, participation and inclusion.\u201d\nOther than the LTS,\nProfessor Buitendijk\ngarnered controversy\nduring her time at Imperial\nover comments and shared\nposts on Twitter, which\nstudents felt represented\ntransphobic views.

    "content": "A Vegan\u2019s View On Antinatalism\nI\nwant to start on the\ncase of re-wilding,\nwhich is gaining\nsupport among\nenvironmentalists today.\nRe-wilding is the act\nof restoring land to its\nnatural, uncultivated\nstate, especially by reintroducing locally extinct\nspecies to either lower\nthe number of an invasive species or a local\nspecies of which the\npopulation has spiraled\nout of control, like deer.\nThis at face value seems\nlike a good idea; by restoring a place\u2019s natural\nbeauty we would be increasing the biodiversity\nand allowing the land\nto return to how nature\nintended. However, let\u2019s\nfirst take a step back and\nthink about the morals\nof this.\nAs a vegan, I simply\nseek to reduce the\namount of suffering\nI cause as much as\npossible or practical,\nwhich includes abstain-SUSTAINABILITY\nShould wolves be reintroduced to reduce the number of deer?// Geograph\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nFEBRUARY, 2020 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPeter Garratt\nSustainability Writer\ning from eating animal\nproducts and avoiding\nthe purchase of animal\nderived clothing or\ncosmetic products tested\non animals. It\u2019s easy\nto see how animals in\nthe agricultural system\nare suffering, but few\nrecognise the suffering\nof wild animals. It must\nsurely follow, that if we\nwant to reduce the suffering of farm animals\nas much as possible,\nthen we would want to\ndo the same for wild\nanimals. And here lies\nthe crux of the argument.\nBy reintroducing a\nnatural predator, say by\nreintroducing the lynx to\nKielder Forest in Northumberland or wolves to\nthe Scottish Highlands,\nwe are increasing the\namount of suffering in\nthose habitats, whether\nit be by the death of\nthe deer by the wolf or\nthe starvation of the\nwolves if they find no\nprey. This obviously\napplies to hunting as\nwell, as killing deer is\nwe ever going to see\nthe grey squirrel, or\nthe American crayfish\ndisappear? Or is it best\nto just leave them, as\nthe suffering of each\nindividual squirrel or\ncrayfish can not be\nexcused for simply the\nreason that they are\nfrom invasive species?\nA new ecosystem has\narisen because of these\ninvasive species, but\nwho are we to say that\nthis ecosystem is the\nwrong one and that it\nmust go back to how it\nwas before? This is an\ninteresting question for\nenvironmentalists to\nconsider.\nOne might say that\nthis is for the common\ngood, as increasing biodiversity is a good thing,\nbut why? Take the Lake\ndistrict, a UNESCO\nWorld Heritage Site\nteeming with natural\nbeauty, but the hills and\nvalleys are plain and\nbare, due to a teeming\npopulation of deer, and\nit has been proposed to\nreintroduce wolves to\nreduce the deer popula-tion. What benefit would\nhaving more shrubs\nand trees have to the\narea? It would be more\naesthetically pleasing\nto look at perhaps, and\nthis may attract more\ntourists, although I\ndoubt it would, and if\nanything, many trees\nand shrubs would only\nobscure the beautiful\nopen views the lakes\nare known for. So, how\ncan merely making the\narea look nicer and more\nbiodiverse possibly be a\ngood enough reason to\ncause the mass suffering\nof animals? The best\nthing we can do is do\nnothing then, and in the\ncase of the Lake District\nagain, let the deer be\ncontrolled by the area\u2019s\ncarrying capacity.\nObviously we should\ndo all we can to reduce/\nstop biodiversity reduction like deforestation\nin the Amazon Basin or\nillegal cetacean fishing,\nas this causes a huge\namount of suffering, but\nonce the biodiversity or\nthe number individuals\nhave been lost, it may be\nbest to not seek to revive\nthe area and increase the\nnumber of individuals,\nas again, this would\ncause increased suffer-ing.\nIf you take this\nargument to its logical\nconclusion, it seems that\nwe would wish there to\nbe no wild animals at all\nand for there to be no\nsentient animals left in\nexistence. This makes\nsense as an Earth with no\nanimals is an Earth with\nno suffering and seems a\nlogical extension of the\naim of veganism, which\nis to reduce the demand\nfor animal products so\nless animals are born.\nSurely this is the better\nthan what we have\nnow. This leads to an\nargument for antinatal-ism, which is the belief\nthat birth is inherently\na bad thing, and that\none should abstain from\nbringing new life into\nthe world. This could be\nargued from the idea of\nsuffering (especially in\nthe case of non-human\nanimals), the ever-ex-panding human popula\u201cAs a vegan,\nI simply seek\nto reduce\nthe amount\nof suffering I\ncause as much\nas possible or\npractical\u201d\n\u201cAntinatalism\nis the belief\nthat birth is\ninherently\na bad thing,\nand that one\nshould abstain\nfrom bringing\nnew life into\nthe world\u201d\nclearly causing a high\namount of suffering to\nthose animals. Hunting\ncan easily be dismissed\nas shooting a few deer\non a regular basis isn\u2019t\ngoing to restore a habitat\nto its former glory. Are\n\u201cwho are we\nto say that this\necosystem\nis the wrong\none and that it\nmust go back\u201d\n30\n\n"

The\nUnion and the UCU,\nas a student and trade\nunion respectively, have\na cooperative history\n\u2013 and that\u2019s naturally a\nvery positive thing in\nterms of influencing the\nCollege and generating\npressure from both the\nstaff and student sides.\nThe UCU is right to\nstrike, in my view. Promises made have been let\ndown with regards to pensions and the establishment of the JEP two years\nago. That the College\nimposed a below-inflation\npay rise in a time when\ntheir President receives\na total remuneration of\nover \u00a3500,000 (including\nher free \u00a3115,000-peryear flat on campus) and\nthey are generating high\nrevenue via fossil fuel\ninvestment and selling off\nchunks of campuses on a\nyearly basis seems quite\noutrageous.\nI would, too, be very\nfrustrated, and should less\ndrastic action fail I too\nwould be inclined toward\ncollective action methods.\nSo I personally support\nthe UCU\u2019s decision, and\nthe Union\u2019s solidarity\nwith them. I feel comfortable putting that out there\nas a personal view.\nHowever, I do not think\neither decision is without\ncriticism. So let me be\nclear: the below is the criticism only. There is plenty\nof positive to say for both\nparties as well.\nI\u2019ll start with the\nUnion\u2019s declaration of\nsupport. Personally, I\nfeel that too few Council\nmembers stood up and\nmade a fuss about how\nnegatively this impacts\ntheir students. While, yes,\nthe long-term ramifications of poor staff treatment will lead to negative\noutcomes for students as\nwell, the fact of the matter\nis that it is current students\nwho will suffer for it. We\nwill have students on\n3-year courses who have\nseen strike action affect\ntwo-thirds of their degree\nyears, adding undue stress\nto an already tumultuous\nand challenging course\nand lifestyle. That should\nhave been emphasised\nmore heavily by their\nrepresentatives.\nWhile support should\nbe given to the UCU in\ntheir time of need, the\ncost to students should be\na stronger consideration\nfor the Union members,\nwho seemed too eager to\ndiscard that in favour of\nsome long-term \u2018greater\ngood\u2019.\nHowever, I think they\nare only partially to blame\nfor that situation. This is\nbecause the choice they\nwere realistically faced\nwith was no choice at all.\nIn Michael McGarvey\u2019s\nown words, as he spoke to\nme last week, students are\nbeing \u201cheld hostage\u201d.\nThis is why striking\non teaching is effective:\nit damages students, so\nthe students complain to\nthe College, and that puts\npressure on the College\nto budge its position. It\u2019s\neffective, sure, but obviously morally dubious.\nWhat it amounts to is\nusing a group of people,\ndamaging them and their\neducation, robbing them\nof the financial input\nthey\u2019ve given to their\ndegrees, and all against\ntheir will while they have\nno say.\nSo the choice the\nUnion was faced with\non Tuesday was \u201cthis is\nhappening whether you\nlike it or not; so choose\nbetween it happening\nand you supporting us,\nor it happening and you\nnot supporting us.\u201d The\nchoice in that situation\nis obvious. As a hostage,\nyou can co-operate, or\nyou can choose not to, but\nin the end what happens\nto you is the same. May as\nwell co-operate.\nYou cannot offer\ntrue consent or support\nto something that will\nhappen regardless of\nwhether you choose it\nor not. You can, at most,\nchoose to \u2018not mind\u2019. In\nno other situation would\nthis be considered accept-able, and would certainly\nnot be greeted so eagerly.\nHow do you avoid this\nsituation? How do you\ngarner solidarity between\nthe students and staff of\nthis community to stand\nup for one another? Well,\nfirstly, you talk. You ask\nfor support and consent in\na genuine way. I feel that\nthe UCU failed to do that\nhere.\nI would have suggested\ninstead talking to the\nUnion Council before\ntaking the strike ballot.\nThe Council would have\nsupported the action,\nalmost without question.\nIt would arguably have\nstrengthened the UCU\u2019s\ninternal campaign for\nstrikes to take place,\nwith the freely given\nsupport and consent of the\nstudents\u2019 representatives\ntaking away guilt from\nacademic staff members\nwho were on the fence\nabout damaging their\nstudents\u2019 education.\nBringing in students\nsooner also allows for\nactual joint student action\nto be organised. As it\nis, you won\u2019t see many\n(if any) students on the\npicket lines shouting their\nsupport, because it was\nleft so late. The support as\nit stands now will be token\nat best, a PR statement for\nthe Union and UCU.\nSo it makes logical\nsense there. It increases\nthe effectiveness of that\npartnership.\nBut the most important\nthing is that that support\nwould truly have meant\nsomething symbolically.\nThe support given now\nis the co-operation of a\nhostage, not an agreement\nbased on equal respect\nand mutual partnership.\nStudents are being used,\nand they\u2019ve accepted\nthis magnanimously, but\nthat\u2019s not how respectful\npartnerships are born.\nRather than stoically\naccepting a sacrifice to our\neducation and choosing to\nstand in solidarity with\nthe staff who, themselves,\nare sacrificing pay to be\non the picket line\u2026 well,\nwe\u2019re instead left with a\nsituation where it\u2019s been\nrobbed away and we\u2019ve\nonly been left with a\nchoice to forgive or \u2018not\nmind\u2019 it, or not.\nI don\u2019t think any of this\nwas deliberate. I think\nit was an error of judge-ment. I raise it not as a\nway to combat the strikes,\nbecause I fully support\nthem \u2013 in both symbolic\nand practical ways. I could\nwrite just as compelling\nan argument piece, using\nalmost identical logic, for\nwhy the way the College\nhas acted on local pay\nnegotiations is wrong\nand thus the UCU should\nstrike. Hell, I have done\nthat, because the whole\nsituation contains so many\neerie resemblances to the\nhalls rent negotiations.\nI raise it to dispute the\nPR line that students are\nin solidarity here. I think\nthat can only be half-true\ngiven the way things were\nhandled.\nThere was no negotiation between staff and\nstudents on this; just imposition and acceptance.\n2\n\n"

Rather\nthis is an issue that anyone\nwanting to express an\nopinion must face.. Will\nmy current opinions\naffect my job prospects in\na particular sector or am I\nnarrowing my chances by\ntaking a stance on an issue\ncurrently and opening\nmyself up to reprisals in\nthe future? With such a\nbroad variety of concerns\nto check off every time a\nstudent speaks out, one\nis forced to question just\nhow much discourse we\nunintentionally suppress\nas a society? To shackle\nyoung minds with the\nentrenchment of thought\nand indoctrination, and in\nprinciple no different than\ncensorship in a communist regime or classroom\nteachings of creationism\nin America.\nWith an informed,\nengaged and societally\ninvested readership,\ndiscourse can be and\nare drivers of change in\nsociety. But as much as the\nwritten word is powerful,\nwe need to recognise and\nappreciate that fluidity\nof thought and ideology\nexists while at university.\nTo be clear, the purpose\nof this piece is neither to\nsuggest absolving student\nwriters of responsibility\nfor their views, nor is to\nto suggest that all or any\nstudent(s) engaging with\nthe paper are ill-informed\nor are likely to change\ntheir views in the future.\nTo take the case for the\nformer would mean\ndelegitimizing student\nopinions and undermining\nthe value of student publications while the latter\nwould be an insult to the\nintelligence of the student\ncommunity. However\nthere is a case to be made\nfor moderation between\nthese two extremes,\none involving a shift in\nsocietal outlook, on how\nwe perceive and digest\ninformation from student\npublications. Fundamental here is understanding\nthat these opinions could\necho developing senti-ments, ones that deserve\nserious and legitimate\nengagement nonetheless.\nOne path to achieving\nthis is through enacting\nexplicit legal buffers safeguarding student writers\nfrom reprisals and calls of\naccountability, similar to\njuvenile accountability for\ncriminal behavior. Such a\nmechanism would in no\nway delegitimize their\nvoice, while offering a\nrelatively safe space to experiment intellectually. In\na society which has a legal\nage mandated on every\nsocial activity in life, from\nsex and drinking to voting\nin elections, it seems only\nfair that intellectual exploration also be harboured\nin a similar way. While\nrecognizing that often the\naccountability that I am\naddressing here happens\ndefinitions and arbitrariness of the modern\nworld is a sure recipe for\nin the public sphere rather\nthan in courts of law, such\nan explicit legal precedent\nwould be one welcome\nstep in shaping societal\noutlook and would make\nthe dilemma about intellectual accountability and\nresponsibility part of the\nmainstream narrative. The\nanswer however is incomplete and with this piece\nI hope to bring voice to a\nconcern that I believe is\nsure to exist among many\nin the university, and with\nengagement, bring clarity\nto the apparent dichotomy\nwith how currently a university press operates in\nsociety - where we expect\none to learn and espouse\nat the same time.\nStrikes\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Editor\nT\nhe University and\nCollege Union,\nthe workers\nunion that represents Imperial College\nresearchers and academ-ics, has announced strikes\nthat will take place over\nfourteen days in the next\nmonth, starting yesterday.\nThese strikes were called\nafter a break down in\nnegotiations between representatives of the union\nand the College over the\npension scheme that the\nCollege pays the pension\ncontributions of its staff\ninto. The pension scheme\nis increasing the required\ncontributions required\nfrom staff which amounts\nto a pay cut for staff as\nthis will not lead to an increase in the pension that\nthey receive. In addition,\nthere is a local pay dispute\nat Imperial, where staff\nsalary increases are below\nthe rate of inflation -meaning a real-world pay\ncut again. See Felix 1742\nNews.\nWhat is the purpose\nof striking?\nStrikes first occurred in\nBritain during the Industrial Revolution. Workers\nthat were mistreated by\nfactory owners would all\nrefuse to work unless conditions were improved.\nIn a modern context, the\npurpose of a strike is to,\nby collectively withdrawing the labour of workers,\nforce an employer to give\nground in negotiations.\nThe strikes adversely\naffect me\nAs students some of us\nare going to be adversely\naffected by the strikes.\nOur daily routines might\nbe disrupted as lectures\nare cancelled and we\nmight worry about content\ngoing untaught. However,\nthis is not the fault of the\nstaff. Many staff will not\nor to discriminate against\nanyone that crosses a\npicket line to continue\nworking, the act of\ncrossing a picket line still\nholds enormous social\nstigma for many. This is\nbecause crossing a picket\nline is associated with a\nlack of support for the\nstrikers.\nThis lack of support is\ntraditionally taken very\npoorly by strikers and supporters of strikes though\nthis depends on who it\nis crossing. If colleagues\nof the strikers cross the\npicket line strikers are\nangry because while they\nare losing out on earnings\nin order to help improve\nthe working conditions of\nthe entire workforce, their\ncolleagues will gain all\nthe benefits without any of\nthe sacrifice. If customers\n(or in this case students)\ncross the picket line, this\ncan be regarded as a lack\nof empathy. If the student\nwere, in later life, to be in\na difficult situation, why\nshould anyone support or\nhelp them given that they\ndidn\u2019t support or help\nthose in trouble striking?\nThe essence of the\nargument is that resisting\nlarge and powerful organisations or employers\nsuch as Imperial or the\nUSS pension fund is\nstrike, despite conditions,\nbecause they will not\nbe willing to put at risk\nthe education of their\nstudents. This brings\ninto focus the intensity\nof feeling amongst aca-demics, that are making\ntheir anger known. Strikes\nare the last resort of a\nworkforce that sees no\nother way forward. The\nfault lies with the pension\nscheme for refusing to\nyield, and on the College\nfor refusing to negotiate\nin goodwill on local pay\ndisputes. Strikes could\nhave been prevented had a\nmore equitable agreement\nbeen reached but the\nCollege would prefer to\nsee staff and students lose\nout and hope that the tide\nof public opinion turns\nagainst the strikes, forcing\nthem to return to work\nrather than give way.\nWhat is a picket line?\nA picket line used to\nbe the line of workers that\nwould gather outside a\nfactory to prevent supplies\nor a new workforce being\nable to enter. Over time\nthe picket line has become\na more symbolic, though\nstill visible, part of strikes.\nWhile it is now illegal to\nprevent people or goods\nfrom entering buildings,\nonly possible if everyone\nparticipates. If a workforce is disorganised\nand atomised they can\nall be, individually, mis-treated. A single absent\nworker can be quickly\nreplaced. However, when\norganised, the strength of\nnumbers gives workers,\nwho traditionally have\nlittle power, might.\nWhy should I support\nthe strikers?\nAs students at a university where many of\nus will go on to go into\nfurther education or even\nresearch, the situation of\nlecturers and researchers\nis directly relevant to us.\nTheir situation very well\nmight be our situation.\nThe pension strikes in particular will predominantly\naffect mid- or early-career\nacademics, as they will\npay higher contributions\nfor longer. Furthermore\nthere is a moral question\nwith regards to the pay\ndispute: why should\nImperial, the university\nthat benefits enormously\nfrom the research output\nof these individuals, treat\nthem so poorly? The\njournal Nature ranked\nImperial third in Britain\nfor quality of research.\nThis is research that is\nbeing done by academics.\nSurely they deserve a\nmeasure of the wealth that\nthey helped to create?\nDo striking staff get\npaid?\nNo. Staff that go on\nstrike do not get paid for\nthe work that is not done.\nThis is in many cases an\nextreme action for people\nthat already claim that\nthey are not being paid\nwell.\nWill my fees be\nrefunded?\nTwo years ago when\nthe last round of strikes\noccurred, students were\nnot refunded any fees.\nInstead money that\nwould have been spent\non lecturers\u2019 wages was\ngiven to the departments\non the basis of how badly\neach department had been\naffected by strikes. By\ncontrast, this year money\nwill be kept in a central pot\nand departments will be\nable to apply for a portion\nof this money. This means\nthat the worst-affected\ndepartments may not get a\nproportional return when\nit comes to reinvestment\nof the saved cost for the\nCollege.\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nFEBRUARY 2020\n\n"

Can you think\nback to 2009 when Swine\nFlu broke out, or the bird\nflu scare just before? Even\nif we\u2019re just talking novel\ncoronaviruses, we\u2019ve\nfaced the SARS outbreaks\nof the early noughties,\nand MERS in 2012. The\nmost recent coronavirus,\nCOVID-19, is the third of\nits kind since the turn of\nthe century.\nCOVID-19 has made\nglobal headlines for a\nnumber of reasons: apart\nfrom being a new disease,\nunlike its predecessors,\nSARS and MERS, it\u2019s\ninfectious without the\npresence of symptoms\n\u2013 not to mention the\nalarming death toll it\u2019s\nracking up. But what is\ntruly frightening about\nCOVID-19 is that it is\nsimply one of a number\nof infectious diseases that\nhave epidemic potential.\nWith a view towards\nan increasingly globalised\nworld, in 2014, the World\nHealth Organisation\n(WHO) chose 11 infectious diseases that posed\na high global health risk.\nThey set up the Coalition\nof Epidemic Preparedness\nInnovations to oversee\nvaccine development for\nthese handpicked threats.\nHowever, a recent cost\nanalysis published in The\nLancet found that to bring\nvaccines for these 11\ndiseases to clinical trials\nfaced a cost of up to \u00a33.85\nbillion for each successful\ncandidate.\nAnd on top of prohibitive costs, or the\ndifficulty of identifying a\ngood vaccine candidate,\nthey can take almost a\ndecade to go from bench\nto bedside. Professor\nRobert Shattock, Head\nof Mucosal Infection\nand Immunity within the\nDepartment of Medicine\nat Imperial, explains.\n\u201cMost vaccines would\ntake, you know, maybe\n5 years in the discovery\nphase, and at least 1-2\nyears to manufacture and\nget to clinical trials.\nThis is partly because\nvaccine development\nhas to follow a lengthy\npathway involving set\npreclinical and clinical\ncheckpoints to test its\nsafety and efficacy \u2013 and\nthe challenges start almost\nimmediately. Vaccine\ncandidate selection can\ntake several different\napproaches. Traditional\nvaccines, like the flu jab,\nmay use dead versions of\nthe infectious pathogen\nto elicit an immune\nresponse, or like the\nmeasles, mumps and\nrubella (MMR) vaccine,\nuse inactivated, albeit\nlive, pathogens. Newer\nvaccinations identify a\nspecific part of the path-ogen, such as a protein\nsubunit, or a toxin the\npathogen produces, that\ncan be used instead of the\nwhole pathogen and will\nstill generate an immune\nresponse. Deciding which\napproach to take requires\nsome understanding of the\nbehaviour of the pathogen\nand its interaction with\nour immune system;\nknowledge that is in\nshort supply when facing\nsudden, novel epidemics.\nLuckily, with COVID19, we wouldn\u2019t be setting\noff blind. COVID-19\nmay be the name of the\ndisease, but the virus has\nbeen given the title SARSCoV-2 \u2013 a new strain of\nSARS. And, as Professor\nShattock describes, this\nmeans we have some\nclues. \u201cBecause this new\ncoronavirus is related to\nSARS, and with SARS\nwe know which part of\nthe virus was targeted\neffectively by the immune\nsystem, we\u2019re immediately able to identify the only\nprotein that\u2019s expressed on\nthe surface of the virus.\u201d\nSo, once the vaccine\ncandidate is selected,\nwhat next? Well, quite\na lot, actually. First,\nthis needs to actually be\nmade into a prototype \u2013\novercoming issues like a\nprotein forming the wrong\n3D structure in isolation\nor stabilising the vaccine\noutside of its natural envi-ronment. Only whenthese\nissues are resolved can\npreclinical tests in animals\nbe conducted to check its\nsafety profile.\nIf given the all-clear,\nthe vaccine can be taken\nforward to clinical tests\n\u2013 but these are still not\nstraightforward. Clinical\ntests are divided into\nPhases I to IV, each monitoring different aspects.\nPhase I trials confirm\nthe animal test results\nby checking it is safe in\nhumans. Phase II involves\nslightly larger trials, evaluating the efficacy of the\nvaccine against artificial\ninfection, while Phase III\nfollows this up with larger\nscale trials in natural disease conditions. Phase IV\ntrials finish the pipeline by\nmonitoring the long-term\nsafety and efficacy of the\nvaccine.\nSo, looking down the\nsyringe barrel, vaccination doesn\u2019t sound like\nmuch use in emergencies\nlike COVID-19. Or is it?\nProfessor Shattock and\nhis team are working on\nsomething new that could\nbe the answer \u2013 RNA\nvaccination.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the kind\nof technology to be able\nto generate a vaccine\nwith a speed that\u2019s never\nbeen realised before,\u201d he\nexplains. \u201cWe\u2019ve made\nour first prototype vaccines\u2026 and within two\nweeks we\u2019ll have them\nin our first animal experiments.\u201d This vaccine\nhas the potential to be in\nhuman trials shortly after\n\u2013 slashing that lengthy\nprocess to four months.\nIf successful, this will be\nthe first time a vaccine\nhas ever been brought to\nmarket so quickly.\nRNA vaccination goes\none step further than\neven the latest technique\nin vaccinology, DNA\nvaccination.\nDNA vaccinations are\na relatively new concept\n\u2013 direct injection of DNA\nsequences that code for\na pathogen antigen \u2013 it\nworks by causing our cells\nto uptake the DNA, read\nImperial researchers in the race for COVID-19 vaccine // tOrange.biz (CC BY 4.0)\n\u201cMost vaccines\nwould take\nmaybe 5\nyears in the\ndiscovery\nphase, and\nat least 1-2\nyears to\nmanufacture\nand get to\nclinical trials\u201d\n\u201cCOVID-19 is\nsimply one\nof a number\nof infectious\ndiseases that\nhave epidemic\npotential\u201d\nthe sequence, and generate the protein themselves.\nThis is quickly recognised\nas foreign and an immune\nresponse is kick-started.\nRNA vaccination aims\nto cut out the middleman\nby injecting RNA, from\nwhich a protein can be\ndirectly built \u2013 and with\nmuch less risk, as our\nDNA remains untouched.\nWith this technique,\nProfessor Shattock and his\nteam estimate there could\nbe a vaccine manufactured\nand ready for widespread\nuse early next year.\nHe concludes, remark-ing: \u201cThis is definitely\nthe future for these kinds\nof viral outbreaks (\u2026)\nWe would hope that\nthis ability to synthesise\nvaccines could quickly\nbe established in every\ncountry across the world,\nso as soon as there\u2019s\nan outbreak, everyone,\neverywhere could access\nthe vaccine.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Athleisure, Can We Equi-not?\nRegular Fashion contributor and owner of fashion brand Simpleboy, John James Humm tells us why he hates\nluxury gymwear and why he thinks you should too.\nFASHION\nJohn James Humm\nFashion Writer\nA\ns much as\nfashion sets\ntrends for the\nfuture, it holds\nup a mirror to society\nand reflects the concerns,\naspirations and feelings\nof the time. Think Dior\u2019s\n\u201cwe should all be feminists\u201d t-shirt from just a\nfew seasons ago, and the\nhuge stir it caused. With\nsocial justice being an\narea of intense debate and\nactivism in recent years,\nthe large fashion houses\nused Chimamanda Ngozi\nAdichie\u2019s essay title to\nendorse the message,\ncausing the fashion industry and wider media\nto pay attention to\ncurrent women\u2019s rights\nmovements. The fashion\nmoments we remember\nare always a case of the\nright aesthetic with the\nright message at the right\ntime. However, there\u2019s a\nnew style which is hugely\nincreasing in popularity\nand market influence\nwhich, in my opinion,\nis completely devoid of\nany meaning or integrity.\nWhat is Athleisure and\nits popularity saying, if\nit\u2019s saying anything at\nall, about contemporary\nsociety?\nAthleisure takes the\nfunctionality of items\ndesigned for the gym,\nadds a touch of luxury, and\npushes up the price tag by\nseveral orders of magni-tude. It was described by a\nJD Sports Chief Executive\nas clothing you can \u201cwear\nto the gym and the pub\u201d\n(just not that one pub in\nEdinburgh which recently\nbanned \u201cjobby catchers\nand mankles\u201d) and it is\nunique from sportswear\nor streetwear movements\nin its focus on minimal\nfunctional designs and\nhigh-quality materials.\nAnd this approach seems\nto be working very well.\nAthleisure in recent\nyears has outgrown\nother clothing areas and\nis expected to swell to\na market value of $100\nBillion (USD) this year.\nBrands like Equinox, Lululemon, and WONE have\nseen exceptional growth\nover the last few seasons\nby encouraging their\ncustomers to wear their\ncycling shorts whether\nthey\u2019re cycling to the gym\nor sat in a Fulham coffee\nshop (with no intention of\nexercising whatsoever).\nThe popularity of the\nstyle codes of Athleisure\nhave made an impact\non high-end brands collections too. MISBHV,\nPoland\u2019s hottest high-end\nstreetwear brand of the\nlate 2010s, is seeing\nworldwide success with\nits futuristic skin-tight\ntops and bottoms. In\naddition, Off-White (the\ntop brand on the Lyst\nIndex, a quarterly ranking\nof fashion\u2019s hottest brands\nand products) has slowly\nintegrated more athleisure\ninto their collections.\nIconically and early on,\nOff-White\u2019s Creative\nDirector, Virgil Abloh,\nsent Naomi Campbell\ndown the runway wearing\ncycling shorts styled\nwith double-breasted suit\njacket as part of their\ncollection inspired by\nPrincess Diana.\nThe increase in the\nnumber and success of\nathleisure brands is, of\ncourse, due to the increase\nin popularity of health\nand fitness culture, and\ncustomers are prepared\nto splash some serious\ncash on letting people\nknow they go to the\ngym. Furthermore, as the\nprice point and perceived\nluxury of these items goes\nup, athleisure brands are\nbeing seen more and more\noutside of the gym as\nwell as inside. Of course,\nwe could say that athleisure\u2019s popularity is in its\ncomfort, its functionality,\nand that having clothing\nyou can wear at work,\nat the gym, and down at\nthe pub reflects the needs\nof modern city-living.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t\nencapsulate Athleisure\u2019s\nappeal completely. People\nused to go to the gym in inexpensive clothing or just\nan old t-shirt and shorts\nstuffed at the bottom of\ntheir work bag, changing\ninto the appropriate\noutfit for the appropriate\noccasion. What people\nnever used to do was\ninvest in clothing in order\nto show off that they went\nto the gym, or to look\ngood while exercising. If\nit wasn\u2019t simply a worn\nt-shirt and some loose\nshorts, it was something\nfrom Sports Direct, JD\nSports. At most you might\nsee labels like Nike or\nAdidas but definitely not\n\u201cdesigner\u201d level garments\nfrom a 100 billion dollar\nsector.\nThe choices we make\nwhen we buy clothing is\nnever a purely pragmatic\none based on functionality\nof that clothing. Whether\nit\u2019s an intention to buy\nour favourite band\u2019s\nmerchandise or we\u2019re\nsubconsciously drawn to\nan item on the rail, we\nmake choices about what\nwe wear because we feel\nit represents something\nabout us which we want\nthe world to know. When\nasked about people\nwanting to do away with\nfashion completely, Bill\nCunningham, the late\nfashion photographer,\nresponded by saying it\ncould not be done simply\nbecause \u201cit [fashion] is\nthe armour to survive\neveryday life\u201d. The\nproblem with athleisure\nis that it is expressing\nsomething banal and\neveryday - merely that the\nwearer goes to the gym\n(or pretends to). It doesn\u2019t\nexpress any insight about a\nperson\u2019s music or hobbies,\ntheir political leanings\nor ideals or even their\nfavourite sports team. Our\nclothing choices don\u2019t\nhave to reflect something\nabout us, but like it or not\nthey do because they are\na choice. The importance\nof fashion as an art form\nis unique because it can\ntap into and embody what\npeople think and want\nto say about themselves\ndirectly. Athleisure represents a step towards\neveryone wearing the\nsame clothing everywhere\neveryday like some kind\nof grey-scale dystopia.\nAthleisure, in my\nopinion, doesn\u2019t stand\nfor much. The only thing\nit reflects about contemporary culture is our\npreoccupation with health\nand fitness and how we\nlack the time to go home\nand change before and\nafter going to the gym.\nConsider any other decade\nin living memory, each has\nits defining sub-culture\nand their corresponding\nideals. Think about punks,\nteddy-boys, hippies,\ncasuals, emos, greasers,\nand skinheads. London\nwas at the centre of these\nand when you walked\ndown the street you would\nsee people from these\ngroups. Whether you associated with them or not,\nthese groups had passions\nand interests that they\nwanted to express through\ntheir clothing, and this\nshaped fashion history.\nLooking around now, I\nhope that my generation\nisn\u2019t only remembered by\npeople doing Pilates and\npush-ups.\nThe double dancer pose: connecting partners to each other and your bank balance to Lululemon // Pixabay\nISSUE 1744\nFELIX\n17\nFASHION felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Furthermore,\nChina\u2019s strict control\nmeasures targeted multiple causes of transmission\n\u2013 for example, banning\npeople from attending\nwork or school, whilst\nalso banning travel, and\nso on. It is then hard to\nidentify what measure\nwas actually effective.\nAdditionally, the\nvirus can incubate for\nweeks between infection\nand the development of\nsymptoms. This can make\ndetermining number of infections and transmissiv-ity challenging, with one\nexample given of a patient\nwho died in France likely\nhaving been infected a\nmonth beforehand.\nThis has led to drastic\nrevisions of initial estimates for the total number\nof cases \u2013 from an estimate\nof 4000 on 18th January to\n107,000 on 3rd February.\nDuring the presentation,\nProfessor Ferguson said\nthat it is likely that the\noutbreak has caused up to\nten times more infections\nthan have been detected\nand reported.\nIt also appears that\nthe virus is significantly\nmore deadly to the elderly\n\u2013 however, while respiratory illnesses are also\noften a danger to children,\nbans on attending school\nin China have limited the\nnumber of young cases.\nA tentative estimate on\nthe fatality rate for those\nwho have already reached\nthe stage of pneumonia is\n18%.\nThere is a concern that\nshould the virus break\nout in pandemic-scale in\nother countries, it could\nput severe stress on\nhealthcare systems; but\nwith forewarning, this is\nalready being planned for\nas a contingency.\nSimultaneously, a team\nof academics based in St.\nMary\u2019s, in the Department\nof Infectious Disease,\nhave been part of a global\nrace to develop a vaccine,\nled by Robin Shattock.\nProfessor Shattock\nspoke to Ryan O\u2019Hare in\nan Imperial podcast. He\noutlined the differences\nbetween this coronavirus\nand a previous one called\nSARS \u2013 namely that\nSARS, while more fatal,\nwas not transmissible\nuntil symptoms showed,\nmeaning that effectively\nquarantining patients was\nsignificantly easier and\nmore effective. Physical\ncontrols are thus less\nuseful, hence its rapid\nspread.\nHowever, a core difference between the SARS\noutbreak and this one is\nthe rapidity with which it\nhas been reported, and the\nadvancement of technology since. With accurate\ngene sequencing available\nquickly, it took just weeks\nto get a novel RNA-based\nvaccine attempt going in\nthe lab. This is by contrast\nto a typical progression,\nwith five years in the discovery phase and a further\ntwo to manufacture and\ndo clinical trials.\nThe vaccine developed\nby Professor Shattock\nand his team has already\nentered animal testing \u2013\nwith the possibility for\nhuman trials to begin\nas early as summer.\nHowever, he warns that\na full vaccine will not\nbe widely available until\nnext year, at the absolute\nearliest. In the meantime,\nantivirals are being used\nin China to try to combat\nbadly affected patients,\nwhich may provide a\nstopgap solution.\nSee Felix Science.\nImperial academics based at St. Mary\u2019s have been\nsearching for a coronavirus vaccine, while at the J-IDEA\nand MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis\nthey have been using data science to track coronavirus\ntransmission and mortality parameters\nSocially Responsible\nInvestmentWorkingGroup\nReports back to College\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhe Socially\nR e s p o n s i b l e\nI n v e s t m e n t\nW o r k i n g\nGroup has completed\nits consultation period\nand reported back to\nthe College Council on\nFebruary 14th.\nThe College Council\nhas reportedly accepted\nthe suggestions of the\nreport with only minor\namendments, which are\nbeing finalised now and\nwill be made public on\nMarch 2nd \u2013 alongside\nan amended policy for\ninvestment. More spe-cifically, the Terms of\nReference for the Endowment Board \u2013 who control\nthe College\u2019s investment\nassets \u2013 will be changed\nto reflect the new policy.\nFor this reason, the\npolicy was initially\nproposed to the Endowment Board on 3rd\nFebruary, before it went\nto College Council.\nThe SRI Working\nGroup was initially set up\nin response to a paper presented to College Council\nin November by the\nUnion President, Abhijay\nSood, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services,\nFifi Henry, and Ethics\nand Environment Officer,\nFrancesca Siracusa.\nThe paper called for an\nassessment of Imperial\u2019s\ninvestment habits.

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nFEBRUARY, 2020\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLucie Jones live at the Adelphi\nL\nucie Jones first\ncame to prominence through X\nFactor in 2009,\nwhere she was eliminated\nas a result of a sing-off\nagainst Jedward. Feeling\nold yet? Right. Despite\nher abrupt elimination,\nshe has gone on to have\nquite the career, starring\nin Les Mis\u00e9rables on the\nWest End, playing the lead\nrole in Legally Blonde\nat Curve Leicester, and\nbeing a part of many\ntouring companies over\nthe year, including the\nChinese tour of Ghost the\nMusical.\nMore recently, Jones\nwon the public vote to\nrepresent the UK in Eurovision. She performed\nthe powerful ballad\n\u2018Never Give Up on You\u2019,\nand ended up finishing\nin 15th place, which, all\nthings considered, was a\npretty massive success for\nthe UK. Regardless, she\ndeserved way better.\nThese days, Jones can\nbe found performing the\nlead role of Jenna eight\ntimes a week in Waitress\nat the Adelphi Theatre.\nHowever, for her first solo\nWest End concert, gone\nwas the diner set from\nWaitress, leaving Jones\nfront and centre on a bare\nstage, with the 22-piece\nLondon Musical Theatre\nOrchestra behind her.\nStaying onstage for two\nhours, Jones\u2019s setlist was,\nsimply put, a love letter\nto musical theatre, and a\ncelebration of her career.\nWith songs from Funny\nGirl, Rent, Waitress and\nmore, the evening was\nthe perfect blend of fun\nand gut-wrenching, all\nwhile Jones provided the\naudience with a vocal tour\nde force. Undoubtedly, the\nhighlight of the night was\nher performance of She\nUsed to Be Mine from\nWaitress. Replacing the\nsimplistic arrangements\nof the source material\nwith the full-bodied\norchestra, and belting\nthrough the climax of\nthe song passionately,\nJones managed to leave\nthe audience in awe. This\nis no surprise, as she\nmanages to do the exact\nsame thing eight times\na week with the exact\nsame song in Waitress.\nAnother highlight was\nJones\u2019s performance of\nThe Prayer alongside\nher special guest John\nOwen-Jones. Despite the\nextreme cheese the song\nmanages to serve every\ntime it is sung, the airtight\nharmonies between the\ntwo performers more than\nmade up for this. The two\nwere not only perfectly in\nsync, they sounded like\none voice. Nay, a perfectly tuned instrument.\nThe top-notch singing\nwas intertwined with\nanecdotes from Jones\u2019s\ncareer, which, unlike\nusual pre-rehearsed\nspeeches in most concerts,\nfelt genuine and fun.\nOpening the second act\nof the show with Into The\nUnknown from Frozen 2,\nshe explained that on her\nInstagram poll, a large\nnumber of people requested her to sing Let It Go,\nbut she decided against it,\nbecause she wasn\u2019t cast\nas Elsa in the upcoming\nWest End production\ndespite her \u2018trying really\nreally hard\u2019. Instead,\nthat highly coveted role\nwent to Samantha Barks,\nwhom, she explained at\nanother point during the\nshow, she met during the\nLes Mis\u00e9rables auditions.\nThey have since gone on\nto become really close\nfriends \u2013 according to\nJones, Barks was one of\nher bridesmaids! Regardless, I think Jones would\nmake an outstandingAnna\nin Frozen. Just sayin\u2019.\nThroughout the\nevening, Jones received\nthree well deserved\nstanding ovations from\nthe audience. As a fan of\nmusical theatre, it would\nhave been impossible\nto leave this show unimpressed even if one\nweren\u2019t familiar beforehand with most of the\nsongs in the setlist. The\nshow was recorded to be\nreleased as a live album\nlater in the year. It would\nbe criminal to not give it\na stream on Spotify once\nit\u2019s out.\nTryst\nT\nryst transports\nus to the beginning of the\nlast century, a\nfew months before August 1915. It is set in\nLondon, off of Edgware\nRoad, and later an unnamed town by the sea.\nWe meet two charac-ters: Adelaide Pinchin,\na hard-working naive\nshop-girl with a generous savings account, and\nGeorge Love, a charming penniless serial\nfraudster. What happens\nbetween them, as the\ntitle suggests, is a secret affair with thrilling\ntwists and a surprising\nclimax.\nWriter Karoline Leach\nclearly knows how to\nexplore the duality of perspectives of her characters\nfor comic effect. In a play\nridden with falsehood\nand deceit, the audience\nbecomes a confidant for\nboth characters, gaining\ninsights into their thoughts\nand an understanding of\nthe broader implications\nof each lie. In that way,\nwe see Adelaide\u2019s admiration for Mr Love grow\nwith each story of exotic\ndiplomatic missions and\nfabulous riches, while\nhis stratagems to dodge\nhis landlady\u2019s demands\nfor rent payment grow\nincreasingly intricate.\nWe follow them from\nthe day they first meet,\naccompany their secret\nencounters, and witness\ntheir relationship growing,\nculminating and falling\napart, too late to avoid\nserious consequences. As\nthe play evolves and the\ncharacter\u2019s inner demons\ncome into the light, we\nalso follow their internal\nresistances and personal\ngrowth. Actress Scarlett\nBrookes makes a very\nconvincing Adelaide,\ninnocent yet astute,\nbattling dreams and cau-tiousness, at the same time\nthrilled and terrified for\nrunning away into a secret\nmarriage. Fred Perry,\nportraying Mr Love, is\nwonderful at keeping the\naudience permanently on\nthe edge of their seats,\nsecond-guessing his intentions and often almost\nfalling for his traps and\nselfish reasoning. The\npower dynamics between\nthem keep changing\nunpredictably during the\nplay, with tense exchanges\ncontrasting with common\nplans, in an intensely\npsychological thriller.\nThe play isn\u2019t without\nfault, however. Some dialogues are a bit of a stretch\nfor authenticity, and the\nstrong, captivating energy\nwith which the play starts\ndecays during the longer\nscenes. By the end of the\nplay, I was starting to\nfeel uncomfortable: not\nexactly bored, but with\na feeling that something\nwas off and they were\ntaking too long to reach\nthe forecasted not-ex-actly-happy-but-a-good-compromise ending. But\nI can forgive it all, thanks\nto an absolutely brilliant\nfinal scene. No spoilers,\nbut I can assure you I was\nstill feeling the adrenaline\nrush on the tube back\nhome.\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

In the case\nof microaggressions, one\nkey recommendation was\nto create spaces for discourse and understanding\non why their repeated\noccurrence can create so\nmuch discomfort for those\naffected.\nSometimes, it\u2019s not\neven about outright\nhomophobic behaviour\nand hostile work envi-ronments, but instead the\nindividual\u2019s innate concerns about whether being\ncompletely open about\ntheir sexuality will hinder\ntheir career advancement.\nAnd again, this is a place\nwhere allies can help, nor-malising, and embracing\ncognitive diversity \u2013 the\nidea that teams are more\neffective because they\u2019re\ndiverse in their thinking,\nperspectives, and information processing style.\nJo\u00ebl McConnell, Executive Director of Marketing, Recruitment and\nAdmissions at Imperial\nCollege Business School,\nand Co-Chair of Imperial\n600, also noted the importance of positive role\nmodelling and how institutional support for LGBT\nprofessional networks can\nhelp staff feel more comfortable to \u2018bring their\nwhole selves to work\u2019 \u2013\ncreating an environment\nwhere staff don\u2019t feel they\nhave to conceal part of\ntheir identity to advance\nprofessionally.\nProfessional LGBT-focused industry networks\nlike InterEngineering,\nwhose Co-Chair Dominic\nCronin spoke on the\npanel, are also an essential resource for students\nentering the workplace.\nOffering insider knowledge on which workplaces\nare truly LGBT friendly,\nproviding an added check\nbeyond the content of\nwhat companies typically include on their\ndiversity page. The term\n\u201cCorporate Pinkwashing\u201d\nwas explored from a\nconsumer perspective,\nand some panellists were\nof the opinion that without\nmeaningful action, taking\nup space at pride and\nslapping rainbow \ufb02ags\non logos is borderline\nexploitative. Further,\nthe commodification of\nthe LGBT community\ncan perpetuate LGBT\nstereotypes, and encourage performativity over\nauthenticity, inclusivity\nand consultant Daniel\nNasr felt his sexuality\nwas at times defined by\n\u201chow many \u2018Yas Queen\u2019s\n[he] said when at work\u201d.\nResponsible corporate\nattitudes towards LGBT\nissues were therefore considered to be a major area\nfor improvement.\nAn emphasis on\nintersectional diversity\nunderscored the discus-sion, with the panel being\ninadvertently all-male\nand majority white, it\nwas acknowledged that\norganizations must work\nto tackle diversity and\ninclusion in a more comprehensive way. Intersectional issues can easily\nbe underappreciated in\ndiscussions about specific\nminority groups, therefore\nconversations between\nminority groups, intersec-tional representation, and\na less binary approach to\nthe inclusion of minorities\nwithin companies is a key\nnext step in building a\nmore diverse society.\nThe experiences and\ninsights of our panellists\nexpanded my understanding of the issues faced\naround diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\nUpon re\ufb02ection after\nthe event, I wondered if\nattitudes towards gender,\nand particularly masculinity underscored many\nof these issues, which a\nless rigid attitude towards\nwhat it means to be a man\nor woman might ease.\nAnd indeed, one of the\nmost important topics in\ncorporate diversity circles\nright now is getting trans\ninclusion policy right, so\nkeep an eye out for developments on this topic in\nthe year ahead.\nMany thanks to all those\nwho attended or helped\nto organise the evening.\nAnyone who would like a\nrainbow lanyard can pick\none up from the CGCU\noffice (CAGB 349). If you\nhave any wellbeing concerns or questions, please\nget in touch at cgcuwelf@\nic.ac.uk.\nO\nn Monday the\n10th of February, the City\n& Guilds College Union (CGCU) had\nthe pleasure of hosting\na panel of LGBT advocates in a discussion on\nLGBT inclusion in the\nworkplace. While my\nsense is that Imperial\nCollege London is generally inclusive, I found\nthere to be plenty of\nnuanced moments and\nlearning opportunities\nduring the discussion,\nwhich I wanted to share\nwith readers.\nIn order to create a\nworkplace that fully integrates LGBT profession-als, straight LGBT equality supporters (commonly\nreferred to as \u2018allies\u2019) are\nessential. While much\npositive change has been\nmade in the workplace,\nthese allies play a key\nrole in ensuring members\nof the LGBT community\nare heard, and concerns\nare addressed if more\nsubtle, entrenched pieces\nof homophobia are to be\ntackled.

The paper noted\nthe impact that poor staff\ntreatment can have on the\nstudent body by demoti-vating staff and damaging\nrecruitment, and criticised\nthe College\u2019s approach to\nhandling local pay negoti-ations.\nThe paper was accompanied by an impassioned\nspeech by Michael\nMcGarvey, the head of the\nUCU, who attended this\nsection of the meeting.\nThe paper suggested\nthat the Union support the\nstrike action, to support\nthe UCU in meetings\nwith the College, and to\ndisseminate supporting\npublicity materials. It also\nmandates representatives\nto ensure impact on students is minimised, as well\nas mandating the Union\nPresident to write to the\nProvost to encourage the\npay dispute be negotiated\nfairly.\nConcerns were raised\nby some Union Council\nmembers about the Union\nactively supporting a\nstrike that has a large negative impact on students,\nciting conversations\nwithin their respective\nremits or student bodies.\nThe paper passed with\na vote of 29 for, 1 against,\nand 1 abstention.\nStanding Orders\nAmendment\nFelix previously\nreported on a Council\ndispute over voting\nmembership of\nthe Education and\nRepresentation Board\n(ERB). Changes to\nthe Standing Orders\nremoved voting rights\nfrom departmental\nreps in order to ensure\nquorum was reached.\nThe Standing Orders\nwere indeed updated to\nremove voting rights, after\ndisputing ERB representatives failed to come up\nwith a viable alternative.\nThese representatives\nfelt satisfied with having\nhad the opportunity to\ntry to resolve the issue\nand discuss it internally\nto ERB. It was also noted\nthat departmental reps can\nstill contribute to indicative votes, which the ERB\ncould hold as often as it\nfelt necessary.\nFurther debate was held\nabout the way in which\nConstituent Unions\u2019\nconstitutions are changed;\ncurrently, these have to\nbe approved every year,\nas they contain regular\nchanges for small things\nsuch as changing the\nname of a position. To\nremove bureaucracy from\nthe process, it was suggested that these smaller\ntopics be dealt with via\nthe Regulations for their\nconstitutions.\nHowever, lack of oversight from Council made\nsome members unhappy\nwith the proposed change;\nchanging the duties of a\nTreasurer, for example,\nhas a consequence beyond\njust the Constituent Union\nitself due to CUs acting\nas management groups\nfor clubs and societies\nas well. Various options\nwere debated, such as\nhanding oversight off to\nthe Governance and Identity Board, each with their\nown issues.\nThe debate was likely\nsparked by the RCSU\u2019s\nrecent decision to unilaterally change their\ncommittee without consultation with the Council.\nThe resolution did not\npass, with a vote of 14 for,\n8 against, and 9 abstain-ing.\nPublicity Policy\nA review of the Union\u2019s\npublicity policy was sug-gested, looking to assess\nwhether its still suitable\nfor the modern operation\nof the Union. Requirements of the policy, such\nas requiring that all events\ngo onto the \u2018What\u2019s On\u2019\ncalendar, were suggested\nfor revision, as was the\nspecific exemption of\nSilwood campus from the\npolicy. Contradictory re-quirements, such as a ban\non having any ICU logos\non election materials\nwhile also requiring that\nall election materials have\nthe ICU banner on them,\nwere targeted as well.\nA working group\nconsisting of the DPFS,\nCouncil Chair, and an\nUnion Council Ordinary Meeting 5: Council Declares\nSupport for UCU Strikes\nISSUE 1744\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFelix continues its series of explaining Union Council meetings, without the BS. Demystifying the Union since Day\nOne\nundergraduate and postgraduate rep in Michaela\nFlegrova and Adrian\nLaMoury was established\nto report back at the next\nmeeting.\nDiscussion of Breadth\nof Council Submissions\nIt was noted that the\nnumber of papers submitted to Council \u2013 and the\ndiversity of students who\nwere submitting \u2013 had\ndecreased drastically this\nyear compared to previ-ous. The Council Chair,\n3\nLloyd James, sought to\nopen up discussion about\nwhy Council members\nwere not submitting\npapers.\nFor reference, the attached table is reproduced\nfrom the Council paper,\nrepresenting what papers\nwere submitted and by\nwhom in each Ordinary\nMeeting (OM) of the year,\ncomparing this year with\neach year back to 2016/17.\nIn general, Council\nmembers responses were\nthat they would typically\ntake issues to the subcommittees for consideration\n\u2013 meaning that perhaps\nthe new Council structure\nhas contributed. They additionally said that papers\nused in the past simply\nto mandate sabbatical\nofficers to take certain\nactions felt like an ineffective method, saying\nthey would rather just talk\nto the sabs informally.\nReports\nThe reports were\ndelivered as tabled;\nsee online materials to\nread them.\nThe number of papers submitted by whom in di\ufb00erent years // Lloyd James\n\n"

Not\nwhilst the Ottomans hold\nthe Levant. The Ugandan\nHighlands? Lion-infested.\nHow about a Jewish\ncolony in Madagascar?\nThe laughter that follows\nis undercut by horror:\nthe Nazi bureaucracy\nwould toy with the idea\nof deporting the entirety\nof European Jewry to the\nisland, before Auschwitz\nand Treblinka.\nUneasy hindsight runs\nthrough the whole of\nStoppard\u2019s Leopoldstadt.\nHermann (Adrian Scarborough), an affluent\nAustrian \u201cof Jewish\ndescent\u201d, articulates a\nfaith in progress and modernity straight out of the\nEnlightenment: his grandfather was chased out\nof Russia by a pogrom;\nhis father ran a clothes\nfactory; and Hermann\nrubs shoulders with the\nPrince ofAustro-Hungary.\nOf course, the mayor of\nVienna is an anti-Semite,\nbut what\u2018s that compared\nto the massacres of the\npast? They are a generation away from being\nconsidered Austrian,\nHermann argues.\nLudwig (Ed Stoppard)\ndisagrees. They are\nJewish, and in the eyes of\ngentiles that mark is in-erasable. The aristocracy\nmight tolerate Hermann\nfor his money, he warns,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s\nassimilated: to be accepted\ndoesn\u2019t mean hiding his\nJewishness, but being\nable to carry on as a Jew\n\u201cwithout insult\u201d. Ludwig\ndoesn\u2019t hold much hope\nin that happening. The\npast is on his side. So is\nthe future.\n\u200b\nAnd so we follow the\nMerzes and Jakoboviczes\nthrough the voids ripped\nthrough the fabric of\nEurope: to 1924, Hermann\u2019s son now armless\nand mad from the war, fascism\u2019s shadow crawling\nover the continent; to\n1938, their families\nhuddled in a single room,\nNazis marching on the\nstreets; and finally to\n1955, the family apartment stripped and worn,\nand a much smaller\nfamily to match. There are\nlaughs, and diversions to\nthe Riemann Hypothesis\n(this is a Stoppard play),\nbut the entire production\ngravitates around Jewishness \u2013 Jewishness chosen\nor imposed, Jewishness\ninside Europe or out - and\nthe appalling negative\nspace Nazism would leave\nin its place.\n\u200b\nIt\u2019s banal to implore re-memberence, and as time\npasses it\u2019s easy to lose the\nurgency and horror of the\nShoah \u2013 political football\nover Polish culpability,\nselfies at Auschwitz.\nLeopoldstadt is not a\nperfect play: no character\nbar Hermann rises above\na sketch, and its digressions are perhaps too\nunrestrained. Yet I\u2019ve not\nhad an experience at the\ntheatre quite like seeing\nan audience, chuckling\ntheir way through the\nSchoenberg jokes,\nbrought to silence by one\nof the last Jakoboviczes as\nshe lists the destinations\nof her family members.\nI\u2019ve never heard the word\nAuschwitz repeated so\nmany times in my life. I\ndon\u2019t have anything intelligent to add. Go see this.\nI\n, Cinna is a tragic\ntale of mistaken\nidentity, set against\nthe background of\nShakespeare\u2019s Julius\nCaesar. For those of\nyou unfamiliar with one\nof Shakespeare\u2019s most\nfamous \u201chistorical\u201d plays,\nit portrays the dramatic\nevents of 44 BC in Rome.\nJulius Caesar, recently\ndeclared dictator for life,,\nis assassinated by his own\nsenators for the good of\nthe Roman Republic. In\nthe aftermath, an innocent\npoet, Cinna, who happens\nto share the name with\none of the conspirators,\nis brutally beaten to death\nby a pro-Caesar mob. I,\nCinna imagines the story\nof this side character,\neking out an existence in\nthe uncertain final days of\nthe Roman Republic.\nI, Cinna forces the\naudience to think. Just\nas Shakespeare\u2019s Julius\nCaesar focuses on the life\nand times of the great and\ngood, so I, Cinna focuses\nthe mind on the small\nand insignificant. Each\nmember of the audience\nwas issued with their\nown notepad and pencil.\nThe power of the written\nword was writ large in our\nlaps as Cinna composed a\npoem appropriate for the\nturbulent times. I came\naway from the play with\na great appreciation of\nstrength.\nTim Crouch, in an\nengaging one-man per-formance, cowers from\nthe powers that be as\nCinna the uncertain poet.\nHe convincingly portrays\na man that is watching\neverything he holds dear\nbeing destroyed. He\ncannot write about life\nand love, but only about\nwar and death.\nI\u2019m certain that the\nword timely is overused\nwhen discussing modern\nproductions. We are by no\nmeans living in Cinna\u2019s\nworld, the violent overthrow of an old regime by\na cadre of hardened, ambitious politician-generals.\nInstead, this production is\na thoughtful examination\nof the might of the pen\nand the danger of words.\nIdeas may not be killable,\nbut people certainly\nare. Cinna the poet was\nmurdered for the crime of\nsharing the wrong name.\nAfter professing his inno-cence, he was condemned\nfor his bad verses. Brilliantly, this production\nshows that in tumultuous\ntimes innocence is no\ndefense against the mob.\nWords have power, and\ndanger too.\nExploring Julius Caesar from the small man\u2019s perspective // Helen Murray\nHermann\u2019s belief in modernity and progress is proven wrong // Marc Brenner\nISSUE 1744\nFELIX\n13\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nFelix Swift Roberts\nArts Writer\nWhere?

I watch\nyour bleary morning eyes perk up as the familiar smell hits. You look me\nup and down, eager for my taste, but be patient. Soon I\u2019ll have that cup\nhot and steaming for you, keeping you warm, soothing last night\u2019s headache - I can make you feel oh-so alive again. Don\u2019t think me a hollow\ntemptress. Have a sip\u2026 a touch of foam so soft on the lips, a bitter kick,\nliquid silk. Drink up fresher. How could you resist?\n-Your caffeine-laden lover, Nadia\n4th Year Mechanical Engineering\nIt doesn\u2019t smell like fall yet, but already the faintness of copper outlines\nitself in the sunsets. I see it everyday, how the sun rises a little less over the\nglass of the library\u2019s top floors.\nThey are soon coming. Freshers who will quickly forget to appreciate\nthese things. The beautiful ones, the simple ones. Instead, they will bury\ntheir heads in coursework and lecture notes. They will swarm in minutes\nbefore nine, late again with their hair dripping wet. And I? I will watch\nthem as my shadow stretches in winter and cold until I am no longer a\nsource of pride but a reminder of once incredulous awe.\nI will only be the backdrop in their parents\u2019 photographs: one taken on\nmove-in day and one on graduation, but otherwise? I wonder if they even\nnoticed me.\n-Ines\n3rd Year Materials Science and Engineering\nDon\u2019t be gullible! The accidents? They\u2019re tall tales. Rumors manifested in\nthe gruesome minds of students acting as a lure. As you are soon to find\nout, I don\u2019t need rumors for allure; I am allure.\nWhen the twilight fades to blackness, and the tempo of the city slows, this\nis when I come alive. The streetlamps and windows dim to my presence;\na radiant, blue aura that defies the night sky. I invite you to stare. And for\nthat one fleeting moment, allow me to show you how the darkness can\nsuddenly feel like home.\n-George Papasotiriou\n4th Year Mechanical Engineering\nAre these really the best years of your life? Watching pigeons fight seagulls on Queen\u2019s lawn and waiting for the scorching scoop of slop they\u2019re\nserving today at Fusion? Well, don\u2019t look so dour just yet.\nIt\u2019s true that after these years you\u2019ll no longer be told to live to the fullest.\nYou\u2019ll just be expected to live. A cog in the globalist machine, your wildest dreams will be clocking out early once in a fortnight. What should\nyou do then?\nCherish the fleeting fits of passion and water the blackened earth with\nyour tears of disappointment. Stand tall on the platforms of success where\nall before you looks conquerable; don\u2019t look down. If you\u2019re not foolish\nnow, when will you be? Take that leap. Tune in and turn on. Whether you\ndo or you do not, I guarantee that Future You will neither forgive nor\nforget.\n-Martin Flerin\n3rd Year Chemistry\nI appreciate your curiosity. Taking a moment to look around, finding a\nfolded note taped under these handrails. Then, drawn by the allure of\nsome secret within, left no choice but to open it. Now please, don\u2019t slow\ndown on my behalf, but do tell me about yourself?\nI see. I remember my first day here. And since then, a constant erosion\nand reassembly of that person under a surgery I myself supervised. Yes,\nthis is a ship entirely in your hands, even if I am giving my blessing to\nyour mutineers. But don\u2019t look so afraid. That fear of change will have to\nbe the first thing to go!\nNow, look up! Here\u2019s the last step. There\u2019s the sign that says CAGB, 6th-floor. But what do you see through the window? You will pass by many\ntimes a day, for years now, but don\u2019t let that gradually shield your eyes,\nfrom the wonder of what you behold at this moment. Maybe we will even\nspeak again. Ah, you want to know who I am. Well, does it really matter?\n-Anon\n3rd Year Bioengineering\nYou should really have bought me. I was\u2014after all\u2014on the reading list.\nBut you didn\u2019t. Not when you realised that my cost could go towards\nother things, like coffee, or ballpoint pens, or those little packs of salted\ncashews they have at SAF Caf\u00e9. How lucky you are to have found me just\nlying here. Go on, slip me into your backpack, and ignore the suspicious\nremains of a library tag barely hidden inside my cover.

    "content": "ISSUE 1744\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nCircles - Mac Miller\u2019s Posthumous Masterpiece\nLastmonth,wewereblessedwithanotheralbumofmaterialfromthelategreatMacMiller,anartistwhosetragic\ndeath ended his impressive, maturing trajectory.\nI\nn January 2020, we\nreceived the final\ninstalment in Mac\nMiller\u2019s legacy, an\nalbum posthumously released following his tragic\ndeath in September 2018.\nCircles is comprised of 12\nmostly unfinished songs,\nrecorded whilst he was\ncreating his critically acclaimed album Swimming,\nreleased just a month\nbefore his death. Circles\nwas intended to complement Swimming, with\nthe two being released\nas a conceptual pair\u2018Swimming in Circles\u2019.\nMuch like Swimming,\nand contrary to his earlier\nwork, Circles is very re-flective, with softly sung\ndespondent melodies and\nmelancholic lyrics.\nThe lyrics that begin\nthe album, \u201cWell, this\nis what it look like right\nbefore you fall\u201d, sung\nover the opening song\u2019s\nslow, repetitive instru-mental, set the scene for\nthe album - an introspective look into a struggling\nmind. The entire song is\ndedicated to his unstable\nmental state. When he\nsings \u201cWe\u2019re watchin\u2019 the\nworld fallin\u2019 down\u201d he\ncan only be referring to\nhis psyche, as he battles\nthe chaos of his own mind\nwith an ultimately fatal\ndrug addiction. Even in\nthe next song, \u2018Complicated\u2019, a comparably\nupbeat and happy track,\nMac stresses over the\nnever-ending complications of everyday life. He\ndoes this again on \u2018Blue\nWorlds\u2019, the album\u2019s\nsecond single, which\nfeatures an instrumental\nthat could easily be from\nhis early party rapper\ndays. Despite rapping \u201cCircles in a\nmasterpiece,\ncreated by\none of this\ngeneration\u2019s\ngreat\nmusicians\u201d\nabout life\u2019s tribulations,\nthe song features a trippy\nchopped up vocal sample,\nproduced by Disclosure\u2019s\nGuy Lawrence, making\nit a standout track among\nthe reclusiveness of the\nother songs.\n\u2018Good News\u2019, the\nlead single and usual\nfan favourite, is the\nalbum\u2019s most complete,\nand arguably best,\nsong. Similar to many\nof the themes seen on\nSwimming, Mac discusses\nhow everybody around\nhim only wants to hear\nthat he\u2019s good, encouraging him to repress the\nnegative thoughts he constantly has. The chorus,\n\u201cGood news\u2026 that\u2019s all\nthey want to hear / No,\nthey don\u2019t like me when\nI\u2019m down\u201d, explicitly\nstates this, and reinforces\nMac\u2019s estrangement from\nthe world. The third\nverse, like other moments\nthroughoutthealbum,sees\nMac seemingly anticipate\nhis own death, allowing\nus to question if it really\nwas accidental. He sings:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot more\nfor me waiting on the\nother side\u201d. We get the\nimpression that he finds\nnormal life so unbearable,\nonly death can bring him\npeace. Although I don\u2019t\nbelieve Mac intentionally\nkilled himself, I do think\nhe carelessly took drugs\nthe night he died, knowing\nthat if he could intoxicate\nhimself enough he could\nescape reality in one way\nor the other.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s gotta\nlive / And everybody\u2019s\ngonna die\u201d. This phrase\nis repeated throughout\n\u2018Everybody\u2019, which\nseems to morph David\nBowie and late rapper\nXXXTENTACION into\n4 minutes of disheartened\nrealisation. The song is\nactually a cover of Arthur\nLee\u2019s song of the same\nname, but Mac takes a\nnew approach, producing\nhis own instrumental and\nadding an original heartfelt piano section before\nthe final chorus. \u2018Hand\nMe Downs\u2019 is the only\nsong to feature another\nanother vocal artist. The\nstart of Baro Sura\u2019s chorus\ndoesn\u2019t seem to fit and\noverlaps with the verses,\nbut we can only assume\nMac didn\u2019t get a chance to\nrecord his own chorus, and\nhis family (who played\na large role in finishing\nand releasing the album)\nturned to friend Baro for\nhelp. However, the vocal\nstyle nicely complements\nthe song and creates\nanother excellent track.\nOne of my favourite\nsongs is \u2018That\u2019s On Me\u2019.\nMac seems to be taking\nthe blame for something.\nAlthough the lyrics are\nquite ambiguous, he is\nperhaps referring to the\nspiralofdeclinehislifehas\ntaken. The backing track\nfeatures a fingerpicked\nguitar melody alongside\npiano, drums and bass, all\nplayed by Jon Brion. This\nsong is another where Mac\nseems to foreshadow his\nown death - it\u2019s as if he\u2019s\naccepting responsibility\nfor his eventual overdose.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait around\u201d and\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut the strings\u201d are\nlyrics that reinforce this,\nsuggesting that when he\ndies, it will be his own\nchoice.\nDespite being incom-plete, Circles is still a\nmasterpiece, created by\none of this generation\u2019s\ngreat musicians. His loss\nis tragic, but although he\nis no longer with us, his\nmusic always will be. If\nyou haven\u2019t listened to\nCircles or Mac Miller in\ngeneral, I suggest you\nlisten to Swimming first,\nfollowed by Circles, to\nappreciate the work in its\nentirety.\nThe beauty of the album\u2019s vulnerability is captured by the artwork // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nZeb Cobb\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Mac Miller.

Last year,\nwe have witnessed the fall\nof some of our best balls to\nthe medics\u2019 secret weapon\n\u2013 whether it was lube or\nVaseline still remains to\nbe seen, but rumour has it\nthat if you taste the water\nof the Ethos pool as time\nrolls closer to Varsity, you\nmight just be able to find\nout which one it really\nwas. Thinking that they\nwould be slick enough\nto win, their plans got\nfoiled by the rage this\nbrought out in IC. Even\nthe jacuzzi team was left\nshook. Perhaps that\u2019s why\nit almost never works this\nyear \u2013 they might have\njust clogged the pipes.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t\nend there. This year,\ntrying to re-establish a\nfriendly competition, IC\ntried to be cordial and\nfun \u2013 turns out that the\nmedics didn\u2019t appreciate it\nat all. Not only having had\nrearranged games four or\nfive times, they never\nvolunteered their pool\ntime \u2013 even if it was their\nhome game. Preferring to\nleech onto IC\u2019s time, they\nwent a bit too far, making\nthe BUCS teams want the\nLUSL win no less than\nLUSL themselves. Only\nBUCS play will some\ntime show who was right\nand who was wrong.\nBut what the Medics\ncan\u2019t score, they can drink.\nThey have beat both our\ncaptains last year in the\nCaptain\u2019s Challenge that\nhappens after Varsity in\nthe union. That\u2019s probably\nthe only event they had\nnot attempted cheating in,\nngl. Will Sasha and Tom\nbe up to the challenge this\nyear? That\u2019s for them to\nknow and for us to find\nout. Very, very soon. For\nnow, enjoy the banter\nfrom the lovely captains\nas they discuss strengths,\nbonding and Varsity.\nNastya: What are the\nteam strengths?\nSasha: Synergy, everyone\nknows everyone well\nand hypes each other up,\npeople know what they\u2019re\ndoing most of the time.\nTom: Shit chat. Petros has\nbeen playing for over 10\nyears for the team, at this\npoint he\u2019s probably a part\nof the pool. Thanos has\namazing brotherly abil-ities, Henry\u2019s ability to\nmake relations with half\nof the ladies water polo\nsquad was useful before he\ngot a girl. [Gets out team\nsheet] Marcus Allen is an\nabsolute legend. We have\nFinlay who, although is\nfrom the north, is actually\nan alright guy. Karan, who\nnever makes it to training\nbut is always keen for\npub, and Sir Lancemop\nas well \u2013 our strengths\nare not particularly water\npolo skills, but rather our\nskills at having a good\ntime I suppose. Our team\nspirit, if you may. We may\nnot get there in style, but\nwe get there eventually.\nNo one seems to know\nwhat\u2019s going on but it all\nworks out.\nNastya:What about\nteam building?\nSasha: We have a couple\nof cans, everyone jokes\naround and people enjoy\nplaying, so the game is\nteam building in itself.\nTom: We do things like\nthe LUSL 2s dinner, this\nyear for the first time we\nhad LUSL 2s ACC pres.\nShit chat on the group\nchat also helps. I think\nwhat\u2019s most important is\nthat past LUSL 2s people\nregularly come back to\nplay \u2013 it makes a lasting\nimpression on freshers,\nthat this is not just a club\nyou join throughout uni,\nit\u2019s something to be a part\nof for years to come really.\nI may as well just say\nthat the captain holds it\ntogether through his ban-terous, awful, humourless\nshit chat.\nNastya: What\u2019s is the\nrivalry with the Imperial Medics team?\nWhat is your outlook\non this year\u2019s Varsity?\nSasha: We\u2019ve got no\nissues against the medics.\nTheir 2s captain, Nick,\ngot annoyed when I faked\nand placed a ball in their\nnet. Demetris didn\u2019t want\nto use their pool time and\nalways kept using ours.\nThey\u2019ve had to reschedule a match four\ntimes. I don\u2019t think they\nmanaged to change it on\nBUCS play, so I think\nit\u2019s an automatic forfeit,\nsince they can\u2019t change\nthe score anymore. So\nreally, nothing major. As\nfor Varisty, I\u2019ve only been\nhere for two years, but I\nbelieve the 1s always won,\nso I will try to uphold this\nstreak this year.\nTom: Varsity is going\nto be good this year, it\nalways is very fun. The\nmedics know they\u2019ll never\nwin, so they play dirty \u2013\nlast year they vaselined\nthemselves. It was really\ndisgusting. And then they\nwere playing human ball\ncurling or whatever. Historically, we\u2019ve never lost\nVarsity. It\u2019s always good\nfun, but the play does get\nquite dirty, with some\nbanter on the side. One\nthing I can say, is what the\nmedics lack in their water\npolo ability, they make up\nwith their drinking abilities in the union. I credit\nthem to that.\nAnd that is it from\nboth me and the guys!\nCome watch the game on\nFebruary 28th\n, or if you\u2019re\ninterested to play, contact\nthe club to participate\nin the soon and coming\nMcComish Tournament,\nwhere teams who have\nnever played polo before\nget a few polo players\nand compete against each\nother.

Stef Smith\u2019s Nora:\nA Doll\u2019s House, adapts\nthis into three parallel\ntimelines: 1918, 1968\nand 2018, chosen for the\nmilestones of women\u2019s\nsuffrage, the legalisation\nof abortion and the MeToo\nmovement. The plot follows Nora\u2019s crisis when\na secret from her past is\nthreatened to be revealed\nto her husband, Thomas.\nIn her desperation, she\nbecomes disillusioned\nand dissatisfied with her\nlife, which eventually\nleads to the deterioration\nof her seemingly perfect\nmarriage.\nThe play opens on the\nthree Noras entering the\nhome laden with bags\nof Christmas shopping,\nchorusing, echoing and\nfinishing each other\u2019s\nsentences as they weave\naround each other in\nan impeccably choreographed introduction. The\nsquare, thrust stage at the\nYoung Vic is perfect for\nthis living room setting,\neasily drawing the\naudience into the intimate\ndomestic scene. The warm\nlighting in the \u2018haven\u2019\nof the family home in\nthe foreground is in\nchilling contrast with the\ndarkness through the three\ndoorways behind where,\nunseen to the audience,\na cold, bleak river lies.\nNora\u2019s warnings for her\nchildren to be mindful of\nthe river are juxtaposed\nby her own romanticised\nnotion of the numbness it\nwould grant her, a motif\nfor her desire to escape.\nAnna Russell-Martin,\nNatalie Klamar and\nAmaka Okafor do an\nexcellent job of communicating their Noras\u2019 shared\nemotional repression\nwhilst retaining clear\nindividual personalities.\nHowever, each actor also\nshifts between characters\nand time periods to play\nChristine (the long-lost\nfriend) which is somewhat\nconfusing to keep track of.\nThe sole husband, Thomas\nis played by Poldark\u2019s\nheartthrob Doctor, Luke\nNorris, who switches masterfully between the roles.\nAn especially admirable\nfeat at the climax, where\nhe and the audience, are\nleft spinning by the pace\nof change.\nSmith makes an attempt\nto tackle the topic of homosexuality as well as the\npersistence of women\u2019s\nsuffering, an ambitious\ntask to do successfully in\na 90 minute play and sadly\nonly serves to detract from\nthe significance of both\nissues. Though largely\nwell written, the script\nalso leaves the message of\nthe play a little stale, with\nsome banal lines such as\n\u201csometimes love is not\nenough\u201d.\nEven though it misses\nthe mark in places,\nSmith\u2019s bold and brave\nreimagining of this classic\nis a gripping watch. With\nits creative role-switching\nand thoughtful staging,\nNora: A Doll\u2019s House is\na wonderfully refreshing\nchange from popular\ntheatre.\nFrom where I\u2019m standing, there\u2019s not much to complain about // Wikimedia\nARTS\nPreet Lalli\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Fortunately, Imperial won the\nmatch comfortably, and\nthe Guard was returned\nlater that day. Imperial\nMen\u2019s \u00c9p\u00e9e continued\nto fence well all the way\nuntil the semi-finals,\nwhere they were defeated\nby a team of incredibly\ngood-looking Swiss\ndudes from University of\nBern.

This mercantile\nthinking resulted in\ncountries, particularly in\nWestern Europe, trying\nto become wealthier by\nmaximising exports and\nminimising imports, in\npart through steep tariffs\non foreign-produced\ngoods. For instance, the\n1764 Sugar Act raised\nduties on imported sugar\nand molasses, to give\nBritish sugar growers\nin the West Indies a\nmonopoly. It was not\nuntil the 18th century that\neconomists such as Adam\nSmith and David Ricardo\nbegan to question this\narrangement, leading to\nthe theory of comparative\nadvantage. This argues\nthat countries each excel\nat producing different\ntypes of products due to\ntheir natural differences,\nand so it is of maximum\nbenefit to all involved if\neach country focusses on\nthe activities in which\nit excels, and trades\nfreely with one another\nrather than creating trade\nbarriers such as tariffs\nwhich subsidise uncom-petitive industries. This\nview steadily grew in popularity in Europe over the\ncourse of the 19th\ncentury\nand until the First World\nWar, for instance with the\n1846 repeal of the Corn\nLaws in the UK removing\nsteep import duties on\ncheap foreign grain.\nAfter the Second World\nWar, free trade once again\n\ufb02ourished, beginning with\nthe General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) in 1947, and\nculminating in, at the end\nof the 20th\ncentury, of the\ncreation of the European\nSingle Market in 1993,\nNorth Atlantic Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) in\n1994 and, crucially, the inception of the World Trade\nOrganisation (WTO)\nFELIX\nA lithograph from the early 20th\ncentury showing Britain in the Free Trade carriage on the left //Wikimedia Commons\nin 1995.

Though\n117 countries signed a\nletter asking the US to\nbreak the impasse and the\nEU is trying to broker an\nalliance to bypass this US\nblock, the lack of multilateral support for the WTO\nwill likely mean that in\nthe medium to long term,\ntrade will become a lot\nmore contentious and less\ndirectly on the domestic\nconsumer, making the\nimported product less\nattractive.

Caring and willing\nto do anything to defend\nher son, she is, to some\nextent, an archetype of a\nmother. But while unconditional motherly love is\nusually associated with\neverything good and pure,\nhere it becomes the reason\nthe character study of the\nmain suspect\u2019s mother.\nDesperate times call for\ndesperate measures and\nthe woman turns detec-tive, quickly becoming\nmore efficient than local\npolice in finding missing\npieces of the puzzle.

This\nmakes her seem less like a\nreal person and more like\na driving force, restlessly\npursuing her goal.

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nFEBRUARY 2020\n6\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIndividual Liberalism and Freedom: The Lie\nWe Are All Living\nCameron Anderson explains why the freedom we are living is a lie and how our only chance\nat survival is cooperation\nCOMMENT\nCameron Anderson\nComment Writer\nI\nt is undeniable that\nwe are approaching\na global crisis: each\nyear we are hit with\nmore and more news stories of devastating floods,\nfires and other natural\ndisasters; the population\nand life expectancies continue to increase, causing\nfood shortages that will\naffect the most disadvantaged of us. There are\nmany problems facing\nour modern globalised\nsociety, but I would argue\nthat the most prevalent\nof these is that of climate\nchange. The temperature\nof the Earth keeps rising\nwith greenhouse gasses\nbeing pumped into the\natmosphere by massive\nmulti-national corpora-tions, governments and\nindividuals themselves\nat a rate that shows no\nsign of slowing down.\nYet, in today\u2019s society, it\nseems although the main\nmethod adopted as a\nsolution is that of liberal\nindividualism. The idea is\nthat we as individuals can\nsolve this crisis by acting\nin our own means: going\nvegan, buying an electric\ncar, using a reusable cup\nand so on. This is not the\nsolution that we should\nbe following as it does\nnot solve the problems it\npurports to. It in fact leads\nus into a state of neglect to\nthe true issue, as I will explain later. I would argue\nthat we should focus\non a community-based\napproach, working together to get the change that\nwe need and deserve. This\ncould take different forms,\nbut the one constant is\nacting as a collective.\nIt has been shown in an\nexpose by the Guardian\nthat 20 companies produce\nover a third of the world\u2019s\nemissions. This fact,\nand similar others that\nwe hear all time (rising\ntemperatures and sea\nlevels etc.), shocks people\nto their core and causes a\nfeeling of powerlessness\ntowards the situation as a\nwhole. This often creates\na desire to help make a\nchange but the main form\nof action, that of liberal\nindividualism, however,\nis counterproductive.\nThe counterproduc-tivity arises from a neat\nideological reversal that\nTo try to begin to tackle\nthe ecological crisis, we\nmust begin to accept that\nwe as individuals cannot\nmake any significant\nchange. In doing so we\nmust harness the angst\nthat this leads to though\nutilising all available\noptions. This may bring\nus back into a feeling of\npowerlessness but this\nfeeling is just the infinitum of choice. When we\nfeel our most powerless,\nthat is when we have\nthe greatest capacity for\nchange. Change never\ncomes to the content.\nWe must act together to\nturn the blame off us as\nindividuals purely and\nonto the governments\nand corporations that can\nactually make significant\ndifference to the situation.\nAlthough governments\nact \u2018in the interest of the\nvoters\u2019, they ultimately\nwork in the interest of\nthe markets: if there is\nnot as much profit to be\nmade through green initi-atives, then they won\u2019t be\nfocussed upon them. If we\nwant real change, then we\nmust take the power into\nour own hands.\nAnother problem arises\nhere however and that is\nthe social popularity of\nthe climate movement.\nGroups like Extinction\nRebellion had massive\nturns out throughout\nLondon and the rest of the\nworld, but what palpable\nchange came from this?\nThe British government\npromises a green policy\nwith investments in\nrenewables and other sustainable ventures whilst\nit is gearing up to invest\nup to \u00a36bn in fossil fuels\nacross the world. This is\nbecause the majority of the\npeople were there because\nit has become a cool trend\nto support climate change\nprotests. Governments\ncan\u2019t be expected to take\na cause seriously if the\nparticipants aren\u2019t fully\ninvested. People want to\nbe seen on social media\nmarching through the\nstreets, but they are not\nwilling to put in the full\neffort that it takes to overthrow the system that has\ncaused ecological demise.\nWe must act as one to\nremove the capitalist\nmode of production that\nis destroying our planet\nin the name of profits and\nturn to a solution that puts\nthe population of the environment above all else.\nNo one today can deny\nthat we are rocketing\ntowards a crisis at an\nastonishing speed with\nclimate scientists telling\nus we must act now as by\neven 2035 it will be too\nlate to reverse the damage\nthat will have been done.\nThe planet is warming,\ndroughts and floods along\nwith wildfires sweep the\nglobe and all the while the\npopulation continues to\nincrease with no sign of\nstopping. Throughout all\nthese problems facing us\nin our modern life, there\nis one idea at a solution\nthat reigns supreme: the\nspectre of liberal individ-ualism. We should push to\ndecentralise power out of\nWestminster and into the\nhands of the people, which\nis only truly possible\nthrough civil disobedience\nand revolutionary tactics.\nIf we really want a chance\nat a future in this world,\nwe need to break free of\nthe ideological chains that\nhold us down and act as\none to fight against the\npowers that be.\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH LIBERALS!!!!!!!!// Piqsels\nacts in favour of the\ncorporations mentioned\nabove and ultimately the\ngovernments that support\nthem. Blame for the situation that we find ourselves\nin is placed solely onto\nthe individual, giving\nrise to the false narrative\nthat the only way that the\nplanet can be saved is if\nindividuals choose to act\ndifferently. Individualism\ngrants us freedom to make\na change, to put all our\nrecycling in the correct\nbin, to choose oat milk\nover dairy and to take\npublic transport instead\nof private. This, however,\nis a false freedom though\nthat leaves us with only a\nfew choices of how to act\nand all of these are against\nourselves.\nNow, I am not saying\nthat we should not still be\ncarrying out these actions,\nbut that we should be\naware of what this type of\naction leads to. In making\nthese small changes to\nour individual life, we\nremove the guilt from\nourselves without making\nany change to the system\nthat propagates this\nproblem. This removal\nof guilt also leads to a\nremoval of decision, we\nare told what we need to\ndo: don\u2019t think, just act. In\nthis sense we are living,\nas existential philosopher\nJean-Paul Sartre would\nsay, in \u2018bad faith\u2019. Simply,\nthis is a self-deception that\nremoves the existential\ndread of true free choice\nthat is part of the human\ncondition. Even if we\nknow that these changes\nwon\u2019t make a meaningful\nimpact, we act this way\nanyway because it is the\neasiest way to forget the\nproblem by thinking that\nwe are solving it.\n\n"

Through\ncasual conversation\nwhich turns into tense di-alogue, the psychological\naspects of a war which\nhas consumed an entire\nsociety are explored.\nConceived back in 2000\nby Caryl Churchill, this\nperformance seems even\nmore pertinent today. Its\ndark themes are tastefully\nintertwined with lighter\ndialogue that gives you\na real punch in the gut.\nThough only 40 minutes\nlong, it feels just as intense as an entire season\nof Black Mirror.\nThe first scene shows\na young girl Joan (Sophia\nAlly) slowly piecing\ntogether a rather harrowing scene that she\naccidentally witnessed.\nHer aunt Harper (Jessica\nHynes) lies to her at first,\nbut when Joan slowly\nreveals that she knows\nmore and more, Harper\ncan no longer cover up the\ntruth. This tense exchange\nalludes to governments\nrevealing inconvenient\ntruths to their citizens on\na strictly need to know\nbasis. The less they know\nthe better, and the more\nthey know the more they\nwill want to know. Funnily\nenough, the audience\nthroughout this play is\nkept in the dark about\nmany things and truths are\nonly revealed and pieced\ntogether over the course\nof the production, making\nit in some ways an immer-sive performance.\nThe next scene sees\nJoan all grown up\n(Aisling Loftus) making\nartistic hats for a parade\nalongside hat connoisseur\nTodd (Simon Manyonda).\nThey cheerily get to know\neach other over the course\nof the week with some\nallusions to problems\nwith their employer. Their\naloof conversations seem\nlike those of guards sitting\nin a break room... during a\ngenocide, as the hats they\ncreate are to be paraded\nby prisoners about to be\nburnt alive.\nThis scene is split up\nwith their hats growing\nin size as well as flamboyance during every\nsection. The way this is\ndone and in general how\nsets are changed on stage\nis genius. Every so often\nthe lights will go off in\nthe theatre, fully off, like\nyou\u2019ve just closed your\neyes. When they come\nback on seconds later, like\nwaking up from a dream,\neverything has changed\nand you feel a bit disoriented as you are thrust\nback into the action.\nThe final scene, by\nwhich point the audience\nmay just have gotten\ntheir bearings, throws\neverything into more con-fusion. The idea of war\nengulfing everything and\neveryone is taken quite\nliterally. The characters\ndiscuss what side different\ncountries are on in the\nwar, France, Venezuela,\nRussia. But then start\ntalking about alliances\nwith other demographics:\ndentists, doctors, dogs.\nMore abstract quantities\nlike weather and gravity\nhave taken sides in this\nfight. Although funny at\nfirst, the visually alarmed\ncharacters live this in their\neveryday life. How can\nthey walk in a forest when\nthey don\u2019t know what side\nthe oak trees are on? How\ncan they leave the house\nwithout being attacked\nby the ghastly \u201cchildren\nunder 5\u201d militias? In total\nwar, all is fair game but\nterrible consequences\nensue when we see this\nreally being put into\npractice.\nYes this all sounds\nweird, but it will have you\non the edge of your seat\nfor all 40 minutes. You\u2019ll\nleave dazed, confused, yet\nat the same time satisfied.\nIf you are looking for\nsomething to make you\nthink, laugh a little and\nhave a minor internal\nbreak down, this is the\nplay for you!\nLoftus and Manyonda have good chemistry during their fun hat making scene until a darker meaning is revealed // Johan Persson\n\u201cIn total war,\nall is fair game\nbut terrible\nconsequences\nensue when we\nsee this really\nbeing put into\npractice\u201d\nARTS\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "ISSUE 1744\nFELIX\n7\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow responsible are you for what you wrote\nor thought as a student?\nArts Editor Vaidhiswaran Ramesh struggles with the juxtaposition of being both a student\nand publishing one\u2019s views in a student newspaper\nCOMMENT\nVaidhiswaran\nRamesh\nArts Editor\nN\ne w s p a -pers have\nhistorically\nbeen drivers of\npublic discourse, shaping\nand giving voice to the\ncontext and dialogue of\nthe day. From toppling\nregimes, to starting and\npreventing wars, the\neffect of the written word\nhas been profound and far\nranging.\nEven with the advent\nof new technologies\nand non-conventional\nmodes of informational\nbroadcasting, newspapers\ncontinue to be the flag\nbearersofthefourthestate,\nboth objectively and in\nthe publics\u2019 view. This\ndisproportionate purview,\nin an age of Facebook and\nTwitter, means that these\ninstitutions carry a great\nresponsibility to publish\nhigh quality journalism.\nA university newspaper\nis no exception to any\nof this, as its role is no\ndifferent from that of any\nnational publication: To\nserve and inform our readership and to provide a\nplatform for discourse on\na wide range of germane\nissues. Sitting at the\ncrossroads of the society\nat large and students,\nthese publications are\nuniquely poised to capture\nthe pulse of the next generation of voters in a way\nthat national publications\nseldom can. The combination of an engaged\nand diverse audience, a\ngenerously open mindset\nand, a degree of editorial\nfreedom, often allows\na university newspaper\nto rise to this challenge.\nIn the past, student run\nnorms and sometimes\neven permanently\nchanging the political\nlandscapes in their respective countries. The role\nof student publications\nlike The Johns Hopkins\nNewsletter in contributing\nto the narrative around\nthe Black Lives Matter\nmovement in the United\nStates of America in\nthe last decade cannot\nbe emphasized enough.\nFelix\u2019s ongoing campaign\nto critically investigate\nImperial\u2019s dubious investments in the tobacco,\nfossil fuel and, armaments\nindustry is another noticeable example of a student\npublication taking the\nlead on changing societal\nlandscapes.\nBut as much as university newspapers strive to\nmeet the rigour of a print\npublishing, it is an inevitable reality that at the end\nof the day, the editorial\ndesk and writer positions\nare filled by none other\nthan students themselves,\noften with partial or a\nfleeting understanding\nof the world around. To\nbe clear, a student writer\nis neither expected to\ngraduate from Sandhurst\nto argue about the necessity of the Iraq war nor\nare they expected to have\ndesigned the St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to articulate how\nunimaginative the Huxley\nbuilding is. Afterall the\npurpose of a university\neducation is to provide\na safe space for students\nwhile they form their\nviews on the world. But\nthe expectation of high\nstandards from the print\npress inevitably bleeds\nacross to university publications as well, meaning\nthat a certain degree of\npolitical correctness and\nadherence to conventional\nthought is expected.\nTo be clear, no reputable university publication\nenforces barriers to entry\nbased on these metrics\nand do their best to reflect\nstudent discourse however\ndiverse and non-main-stream it might be (recent\nexchanges in Felix on the\nHong Kong protests is testimony to that). However,\nno publication is frozen in\ntime and history suggests\nthat contextual latitude\nis seldom offered to\npublications in hindsight.\nGenerally true for any\nopinionated piece, this is\nhighly relevant in the case\nof a university publication\nwith its student body of\ncontributors. A student\nis thus often forced to\nconfront a choice every\ntime he picks a pen\u2026\nwhether to find a permanent voice for their\nopinion unashamedly or\ngive into second thoughts\nand concerns of reprisals\nand back down.\nIt is an open secret\ntoday that prospects of\nemployability are tied\nwith one\u2019s political and\nphilosophical perspective\nwhere outspoken views\nrunning against mainstream thought are often\nseen as a liability for\nthe company. With buzz\nhuman resource terms\nlike \u2018culture fits\u2019 gaining\ntraction, such practices\nare only keen to increase.\nAs a result, every writer\nin the digital age thinks\ntwice (or ought to) before\nsending a piece out to\nan editor, more so if the\npiece is political, societal\nor controversial in nature.\nEditorials Boris Johnson\npenned in the late 90s were\nin vogue decades later,\nwith political opponents\nand media houses trying to\nuse them to influence the\nnarrative around the 2019\nUK elections. Another\nexample can be seen in\nAmerica where senator\nRon Paul tried in vain for\ndecades to disassociate\nhimself from the racist\ncontents of newsletters he\npublished in the later half\nof the 20th century. These\ncase studies testify to the\npotency and longevity\nof the written word and\nin such a climate, it is\nnot hard to understand\nthe anxiety of university\nstudents when it comes to\nvoicing their unabridged\nthoughts, lest they be misunderstood or even worse,\nthey come back to haunt\nthem in the future.\nTo be fair, I am not\njust attacking political\ncorrectness or addressing\nthe woke culture within\nthis context. These are\nreasonable consequences\nof centuries of exploitation of a free press by\nradical entities to find\nspace for detrimental and\nmarginalizing narratives\nand are thus certainly\nnecessary today as mental\ncheckpoints for any writer\nto ensure equity. The fault\nlines I wish to address\nYou think we\u2019d use our own newspaper // Rahway High School\n\u201cThese\npublications\nare uniquely\npoised to\ncapture the\npulse\u201d\nnewspapers have been\ninstrumental in breaking\ndown archaic societal\n\n"

Jollof Mama has managed to set itself apart\nfrom all the other West African themed spots popping\nup. Not only do they have this head turning dish but it\nalso has the added benefit of working so well. Let\u2019s see if\nI can turn you into a believer too.\nFOOD\nZahra Abiola\nFood Editor\nI\nmperial is all about\ninnovation. From\nHackathons to the\nEnterprise Labs, the\nability to create out of\nwhat is new and bring new\nlife to what is old is in the\nvery essence of not only\nthis institution but all of\nLondon. So, when I saw\nthat there was a food stand\nthat sold jollof burritos, an\namalgamation of a much\nloved West African dish\nin a Mexican-inspired\npackage, I just had to see\nwhat they had to offer.\nAnd I have to say that I am\nso glad I did. Last term, I\nwent every week to one of\ntheir locations.\nNow you can\u2019t write\nabout jollof rice without\naddressing the parboiled\nelephant in the room. All\nover West Africa, there\nare fights about which\ncountry has concocted the\njollof rice recipe to rule\nthem all. I\u2019ll leave that for\nour other writer to debate\nbut all I\u2019m going to say is\nthat Nigeria may not win\nmany battles, but with this\nlate addition to our troops,\nwe may just win the war.\nThe first obstacle was\ngetting to this gem. It was\na hard sell to many of my\nfriends to do the journey\nwith me. Many are\nspoiled by the Farmer\u2019s\nMarket just outside of\ntheir departments. They\nare too used to one of the\nTuesday stall options and\nnothing more as their adventurous choice of meal\nfor the week. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I love the market\nbut with the same vendors\npresent every week, once\nyou\u2019ve tried them all\nthere nothing exciting\nto it anymore. However,\nthis stand is only open\nfor a short period of time\nand changes location\nthroughout the working\nweek, making finding the\nday where we were free\nand the stall was close by\na harder problem than the\nSeven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.\nI found that as Imperial\nstudents, our best bets are\nTuesdays and Fridays.\nOn Tuesdays they are in\nWhite City, a short walk\nfrom the White City\nCampus and on the way\nto the South Kensington\nCampus for those of you\nliving in North Acton. On\nFridays, they are in Hammersmith\u2019s Lyric Square\na mere stone throw away\nfrom at least one Medicine\nstudent at any given point.\nThey are open from 11:30\ntill 14:00 but sometimes\nthey sell out fast so I\nrecommend getting there\nsooner rather than later to\navoid disappointment.\nThe infamous jollof\nburrito is not just a\ngimmick to make your\nparent kiss their teeth\nat what you get up to at\nuniversity. It\u2019s packed to\nthe brim with jollof rice,\nplantain, suya, beans\nand salad. The jollof rice\nis the next best thing to\nyour mother\u2019s recipe. It\u2019s\nmade fresh on site and\nwell-seasoned. It makes\nthe burrito a really warm,\nfilling treat. I find the\nbeans to be very plain as\nthey aren\u2019t stewed like\nnormally done in Nigeria.\nI sometimes get mine\nwithout them as they don\u2019t\nreally add to the flavour\nor texture though they do\nshow a commitment to the\nMexican theme.\nThe suya comes as\nTheir wrap is the lighter option // @hungry.students\n\u201cThis is an\namalgamation\nof a much\nloved West\nAfrican dish\nin a Mexican\ninspired\npackage\u201d\n\u201cMany are\nspoiled by\nthe Farmer\u2019s\nMarket just\noutside of their\ndepartments\u201d\neither chicken or beef\nand you can get a mix of\nboth. Both work really\nwell, never tough or\ndry in the burrito which\nwould take away from\nexperience. Their plantain\nis my favourite part of the\nmeal. You see, plantain is\na lot like banana but a bit\nstarchier. It\u2019s more akin to\npotatoes in the sense that\nit is cooked like a vegeta-ble. For this burrito, they\nare cut into cubes and\nfried at the stand. They\nalways manage to use soft\nplantains that makes for\na whole new dimension\nto the texture and a burst\nof sweetness whenever\na piece is included in\nthe bite. It\u2019s always a\nwelcomed surprise. The\nIncredibly filling and hit the spot // @hungry.students\n\u201cThe infamous\njollof burrito\nis not just a\ngimmick to\nmake your\nparents kiss\ntheir teeth\u201d\n\n"

With\nthe memory of 2018\u2019s\ncancellation still fresh\nin the club\u2019s memory,\nStorm Ciara threatened\nto close the parks due\nto high winds. An email\nfrom the Royal Parks two\ndays before the event was\npanic inducing at best,\nthreatening to cancel the\nevent again, but luckily\nthe weather held off just\nlong enough for the event\nto take place in safety.\nWith a disgustingly\nearly start for the organisers to set up registration\nand bring the food, the\ncrowds started arriving at\n10 am at Metric to sign\ntheir team in.\nSoon enough, all teams\nhad registered and made\ntheir way to the Bandstand in Hyde Park where\nthe race would soon start.\nThe weather was glorious.\nThe wind was down,\nthe sun was shining, it\nwas more than we could\never have hoped for.

It is the\nsame thing as the burrito\nbut without the jollof rice\n- a much lighter option for\nthose that can\u2019t get behind\ntheir favourite childhood\ndish being used in a sacrilegious manner. They also\nhave a jollof rice meal that\n\u201cTheir plantain\nis my favourite\npart of the\nmeal. It is the\nmost creative\npart of the\nburrito to me\u201d\nPerfect to quell your home sickness // @hungry.students\nyou can get by itself \u2013 no\nfunny business. This is a\nbig meal so it\u2019s for those\nwho have an appetite.\nThe sauces here\nare elite. While they\nare putting your meal\ntogether, they allow you\nto pick from the suya\npepper, spicy mayo and\nchilli sauce. Heed my\nwarning now, no matter\nhow good you think you\nare with spicy food, the\nchilli sauce will give you\na run for your money. For\nthe more adventurous of\nyou out there, this is a\ngreat challenge and really\nbrings a new layer to the\nmeal. Once you get past\nthe burning sensation, it\ncan actually taste sweet.\nAll the meat at Jollof\nMama is halal for the\nMuslims out there but\nsadly everything is made\nwith peanut oil for those\nof you with nut allergies.\nThe beef can be made to\nthe doneness you desire\nwhich is a good indicator\nof nice cuts being used.\nThe stand out thing\nabout this place is\nprobably the owner. She\nis one of the loveliest\npeople I have met during\nmy foodie escapades. She\nquickly learnt who I was\nand always struck up conversation with me while\nI waited for my wrap of\ngoodness, making sure to\nadd a little bit extra for me\nand my friends.\nJollof Mama has\nbecome a part of not only\nmy weekly university\nschedule but also all my\nfriends. Once skeptics,\nall the friends I put on to\nJollof Mama love it. It\u2019s\ngotten to the point that\nwe nominate someone to\nget the order for everyone\nelse on Fridays.

In\nreaction, since 2001 the\ngovernment has again\nbegan levying a tax on\nthe export of raw nuts,\nof the order of 18-22%.\nHalf of the cashew nuts\nproduced in Mozambique\nare now processed domes-tically, and the industry\nhas grown to employ\n17,000 people. Free trade\neconomists argue that\nthe trade-off from this\nlevy is the neglect of\nthe 1.3 million families\nwho grow cashew nuts,\nartificially pushing down\nthe price of their crop.\nYet reality is messier than\neconomic theory \u2013 due\nto the poor infrastructure\nconnecting farmers and\ncashew processing facto-ries, farming smallholders\nare often in the pocket\nof middlemen traversing\nrutted roads to take the\ncashews to market. It is\nestimated that the 1990s\nreforms made the average\npredictable.\nTariffs for good\nThere are some arguments in favour of tariffs.\nIn poorer countries, they\ncan be easier to collect\nthan sales taxes, requiring\ncollection only at ports.\nGiving countries the\nability to impose tariffs,\nshould they choose, can\nhelp individual countries\nfeel in control of their\nsovereignty, garnering\nsupport for multilateral\nfree trade agreements.\nTariffs can in certain\ncases soften the blow\nof change in domestic\nindustries, protecting\na certain subset of the\npopulation who work in\na declining industry from\ndramatic change to their\nlivelihoods. It is possible\n\u201c It is possible\nthat short-term tariffs\ncan in certain\ncases help\na nascent\ndomestic\nindustry catch\nup with more\ndeveloped\nforeign rivals. \u201d\nfarming household\nricher by a mere $5.30.\nHowever, it is prudent\nto remember that tariffs\nalso cause economic distortions which can have\nunintended consequences.\nIn Mozambique, a side\neffect of the levy is a\nbooming black market in\nraw cashew nuts out of\nthe country, helping politically connected cartels\nlaunder money which is\nused to ship heroin into the\ncountry. Ultimately, tariffs\nare a dangerous weapon\nwhich almost always\nharm the country levying\nthem. They draw workers\nand investment towards\nprotected industries\nand away from others,\ncreating inefficiencies and\nreducing productivity. Politically, they encourage\nlobbying from powerful\nindustrial groups seeking\nprotection. They can\nalso erode trust between\ncountries and invite retaliatory tariffs from foreign\ngovernments, hurting\nexporters. Though they\nmay temporarily boost a\ncertain domestic industry,\nthey make goods and\nservices more expensive\nfor a much larger base of\nconsumers. Unfortunately, tearing down existing\ntrade deals and erecting\nnew trade barriers is far\neasier than negotiating\nmultilateral tariff reduc-tion.

    "content": "Jollof Rice: Settling the Debate\nFOOD\nMariam Jallow\nFood Writer\nI have decided to\naddress head-first the age\nold feud between many\nwest African countries.\nThe tomato based rice\ndish, commonly known\nas jollof rice is prevalent\nacross west Africa, with\nrecipes differing slightly\nbetween countries leading\nto a heavy debate about\nwhich country makes the\nbest jollof. If you know\nany westAfricans then I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019re fully aware\nof this feud but if not,\nthen proceed to read the\nrest of this heavily biased\narticle where I\u2019ll explain\nwhy I believe Gambia is\ndeserving of this title. I\nwant to present a voice for\na country which is largely\nunderrepresented in this\ndebate. Gambia, the literal\nsmiling coast of Africa is\nthe smallest country in\nmainland Africa which I\nbelieve has contributed to\nmany other, much larger\nwest African countries,\nestablishing a louder\nvoice in this debate and\nneglecting the very valid\nrights that Gambians have\nto this dish.\nBefore going into the\ntechnicalities of which\ncountry makes the best\njollof, I think it\u2019s important to cover the origins\nof the dish. Many west\nAfricans engaged in the\ndebate probably aren\u2019t\naware of this but the dish\nactually originated in\nsenegambia- a confederation between Senegal and\nGambia. People traveling\nand spreading out across\nwest Africa resulted in\nthe different regional varieties we have now. This\ndish being called jollof\nis derived from the name\nof the Wolof people who\noriginally created the dish.\nIn Gambia, we call jollof\nrice benachin which literally translates to \u2018one pot\u2019,\ndenoting the method of\ncooking where everything\nis essentially cooked in\nthe same cooking pot. I\u2019m\nnot claiming that because\nwe created it it means we\nmake the best one but I\ndo think it\u2019s important to\ngive credit where it\u2019s due\nwhich many people fail to\ndo regarding this matter.\nYou may be wondering\nwhy I do not include\nSenegal with Gambia\nas having the best jollof\nbut that\u2019s because I have\npersonally tested Senegaleese benachin when I\nvisited Senegal and in the\nnicest way possible, the\nsenegaleese jollof lacked\nthe flavour and spice that\nwe have in Gambia. We\nmight be close together\nin distance but when it\ncomes to benachin, we are\non completely different\ncontinents.\nAs mentioned before,\n\u201cThere are\nvariations in\nthe cooking\nof jollof rice\nbetween\ndifferent\nregions \u201d \u201cTo many non\nAfricans this\nmight seem\nlike a lot of\nfuss over\nsimple but\nit is a sense\nof pride for\nmany\u201d\nthere are variations in\nthe cooking of jollof rice\nbetween different regions\nresulting in subtle changes\nin the taste, flavour and\nappearance of the dish.\nGambians begin cooking\nbenachin by frying\nonions, tomato paste and\nscotch pepper past the\nstage of caramelization to\nthe point where it nearly\nappears burnt; adding a\ndeep smoky flavour to the\nrice. Anyone who\u2019s ever\ncooked it knows the level\nof patience and precision\nrequired; it\u2019s definitely not\nsomething you can whip\nup in half an hour. This is\nthen proceeded by adding\nthe rice and cooking it\nwithin this caramelized\npaste. On the other hand,\njollof requires chopped\ntomatoes instead of the\npuree and sauteing is done\nfor considerably less time.\nThis difference results in\nbenachin having a much\ndarker colour and a different flavour. Another small\nbut significant difference\nis the fact that benachin\nis usually made with short\ngrain rice whereas jollof\npredominantly uses long\ngrain rice. This doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily affect the taste\nbut it is a difference none-theless. Although there\nare similarities in that\nboth jollof and benachin\nis usually served with a\nchicken, beef or fish side,\nwe differ on the additional\nsides. Benachin usually\ncomes with a selection of\nvegetables such as carrots,\ncassava, cabbage and\naubergine. Jollof however\ngoes beyond this and can\nalso include coleslaw,\nsalad and plantain. Whilst\nplantain has its place in\nthe Gambian diet, that\nplace is not alongside\na savoury rice dish, but\neach to their own.\nTo many non Africans\nthis might seem like a lot\nof fuss over simple but\nit is a sense of pride for\nmany west Africans. As\nour national dish, it holds\nthe same place that fish\nand chips and curry holds\nfor many british people.\nAll pettiness aside, I do\nthink that it\u2019s nice to see\nall west african countries\nunited in their love for this\ndish; even if it\u2019s conveyed\nwith a little bit of hostility.\nIn all honesty, there is\nno true way of knowing\nwho actually makes the\nbest version of jollof as\nrecipes can differ even\nbetween people who live\non the same street. When\nI say Gambian\u2019s make the\nbest jollof I mean that the\nversion my mum makes\nis better than the jollof\nrice I tasted from a doggie\nrestaurant. Every family\nhas their own unique\nrecipe, the benachin my\npaternal grandma makes\nis different from the\nrecipe my maternal great\ngrandmother passed down\nto my mother. They\u2019re\nboth different but both\nstill great and I\u2019m sure\nthe same can be said for\neach regional variation.\nHonestly it\u2019s all love; and\nanyway, we all know that\nJamie Oliver\u2019s \u2018authentic\u2019\njollof recipe trumps them\nall.\nISSUE 1744\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nOne way of making jollof rice // Mariam Jallow\n\n"

    "content": "SUSTAINABILITY\nFELIX ISSUE 1744\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ntion size which clearly\nneeds to be slowed\nsomewhat, and the idea\nof crucial asymmetry.\nThis argument essentially proposes that it is\nalways more important\nto minimise suffering\nthan to maximise\npleasure.\nThe philosopher\nDavid Benatar phrased\nit like this: The presence\nof suffering is \u2018bad\u2019, and\nthe presence of pleasure\nis \u2018good\u2019. The absence is\nsuffering is \u2018good\u2019, but\nthe presence of pleasure\nis \u2018not bad\u2019, in the sense\nit\u2019s neither \u2018good\u2019 nor\n\u2018bad\u2019. Therefore, it is\nalways better to not\nhave children as if you\ndo, they will experience\n\u2018bad\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019, but the\nabsence of life is not bad\nat all, it is either \u2018not bad\u2019\nor even \u2018good\u2019. Another\nway to state this is that,\nbecause life brings both\npleasure and suffering,\nand suffering is \u2018bad\u2019,\nbut non-existence brings\nneither suffering nor\npleasure, it is therefore\npreferable.\nOne main criticism of\nthis argument is that it is\neasy to imagine a life\nthat has more pleasure\nthan suffering, and\ntherefore net pleasure.\nHowever, since the\nabsence of pleasure\nby not being born is\n\u2018not bad\u2019, i.e. a neutral\nstance, then any kind\nof suffering, no matter\nhow small, received in\nlife makes it better to\nnot have lived at all.\nRegardless of whether\nthis convinces you, it\u2019s\nhard to ignore all the\nsuffering that does go\non in the world, whether\nit be disease epidemics,\nnatural disasters, mass\ngenocides, war, hunger\nand starvation\u2026 you\nget the idea. More\npeople will also accelerate global warming\nwhich will inevitably\nlead to mass ecosystem\ncollapse, mass migrations and undoubtedly\nmore conflicts. This\nargument would certainly appeal to the\nenvironmentalist, as it\u2019s\nhard to see why adding\nto the population could\nbe a good thing. Benatar\ngoes further to say that\nany suffering that your\noffspring receive is\ncompletely your fault,\nand it\u2019s your fault if your\noffspring then go on to\nhave more offspring, for\nnot keeping it in your\npants.\nWhat can we do about\nit? What\u2019s important\nto get across is that\nantinatalism does not\nlead to nihilism and the\nidea that we might as\nwell kill everything and\neveryone, as obviously\nthat would cause a large\namount of suffering.\nInstead we need to\nreduce the number of\nhumans and sentient\nnon-human animals\nfrom being born in the\nfirst place. In humans\nthis is easy, by either\nabstaining from sexual\nrelations or by using appropriate contraception.\nIn animals it is clearly\nnot that easy, as we\ncan\u2019t go around handing\ncondoms to deer or\nsquirrels, but there are\nthings that can be done.\nOne example is to reduce\nthe suffering of wild\nanimals via diseases,\nsome countries have\nimmunised foxes (ob-viously this was likely\ndone for the benefit of\nhumans, but still helped\nthe foxes nonetheless).\nAnother example is\nthe mass sterilisation\nof mosquitos achieved\nby work at Imperial to\ncombat the spread of\nhuman diseases.\nThese approaches\nclearly aren\u2019t impossi-ble, but right now this\nsimply needs to be a\ntopic of conversation,\njust like veganism does,\nto spread the word and\nso people can think\nabout it so we can build\nthe foundations for it\nnow, for the future. One\nobvious thing we can\ndo as individuals is to\nonly ever obtain pets\nfrom shelters, not from\nbreeders as this does\nnot increase demand for\nthe birth of more pets.\nFurthermore, we can\napply this to humans,\nso we should only ever\nadopt a child instead of\nhaving our own. I see\nabsolutely no reason\nwhy people should have\ntheir own children when\nthere are plenty already\nborn waiting for a new\nparent\u2026\nOne particularly\ninteresting objection to\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nimportant\nto get across\nis that\nantinatalism\ndoes not lead\nto nihilism\u201d\nthis theory came to me\nafter one of my recent\nlectures by Professor\nLeroi. We were studying\nthe genetic health of\nhumans, and one of the\npoints made was the\npossible decline of intelligence in humans in the\nfuture. The idea is based\non evidence that poorly\neducated, low IQ, high\nBMI and short people\nare more likely to have\nkids than well educated,\nhigh IQ tall and low BMI\npeople. This logically\nwill lead to a steady\ndecline of IQ in humans,\nand a study conducted\nby Kong et al. in 2017\non a population of 500k\npeople in Iceland concluded that this would\nlead to a drop of 0.3\nIQ score every gener-ation. This decline is\ncurrently being masked\nby the Flynn effect,\nlikely caused by the\nsecularisation of society\nand in general the IQ\nscore is being raised by\n2 points per generation\nas more people have\nthe opportunity to go\non to further and higher\neducation (IQ is always\nnormalised in surveys\nso 100 is the mean,\nand when people take\nolder tests, the mean\nrises well over 100).\nHowever, this effect will\nlikely plateau eventu-ally, so IQ decline may\nbe real in the future. So,\nif people do start subscribing to antinatalism,\nit is likely that the more\nintelligent in the population would adhere to\nit, which would further\naccentuate the trend we\nalready see which is\n\u201cIt seems\nto me that\nantinatalism\nis just a logical\nprogression\nfrom\nveganism\u201d\noften attributed to more\nintelligent people focussing more time on education and careers rather\nthan having children,\nand therefore even\naccelerate a decline of\nIQ in future human pop-ulations. This argument\ncould also be seen as an\nopposition to adoption if\nyou know that you and\nyour partner are very\nintelligent, however the\nimpact of ones genetics\nas opposed to environ-Is it ethical to bring new life and cause more suffering?// Pixabay\nmental factors is not\nknown, and genetics\ncould in fact play a\nminiscule role in determining how intelligent\nyour offspring would be.\nIn conclusion, it seems\nto me that antinatalism\nis just a logical progression from veganism, and\nindeed vegans already\nsubscribe to the idea\nthat it\u2019s bad to bring new\nfarm animals into exist-ence, and it\u2019s certainly\nsomething everyone\ntoo should think about,\nwhether you\u2019re a vegan,\nan environmentalist or\nneither, as it offers a\nvastly different view\nthan what we\u2019ve been\nexposed to before. This\nstatement paraphrased\nfrom Sam Harris in an\ninterview with him and\nDavid Benatar is certainly worth a ponder: Antinatalism basically leads\nto the idea that having\nchildren is essentially\nan act of negligence\nand ignorance, and\nthat having children is\nsimply an irresponsible\nact consigning people to\nthe fate of existing.\n31\n\n"
