Violence is golden.
The problem with making a
film centred around a racist
character is that it invites
the charge that the film
itself is so, particularly
when the direction, script
and camera angles force
the audience to identify
with the character. In spite
of these facts I don't
believe that M i c h a e l
C i m i n o ' s new film Year of
the Dragon is
fundamentally racist. T h e
victims of the central
character's racism, the N e w
York C h i n e s e , are
portrayed as varied and as
human as any other group,
and certainly not as a Fu
M a n c h u , or any other,
stereotype.
The racist in question is
a New York policeman
Stanley White, played by
Mickey Rourke. White is
arrogant, selfish and
obsessed, but for all these
faults he still proves to be
sensitive and vulnerable.
This wide range of
emotions and
characteristics are superbly
portrayed in one of the best
performances I have seen
for a long time. R o u r k e is
an actor who always
appears to be s u p p r e s s i n g
a violent rage behind a
gentle smile, s o m e o n e who
may explode at any
moment, and as s u c h is
well suited to the role as
Stanley White.
White is a Vietnam
veteran brought in, as N e w
York's most decorated cop,
to control C h i n a t o w n after
the benign leader is
usurped by a longer more
ambitious man. in this
superior and friend tells
him.
It is a very emotive and
powerful film photgraphed
position he sees himself
fighting the war again, only
this time there is no jungle
to hide in and this time he
is going to win. He also
c o m e s into conflict with his
superiors w h o at first
refuse to believe that there
is a problem, they don't
want to make too m u c h
trouble; 'Life is about
getting along', White's
with s o m e impressive but
not intrusive c a m e r a
movements. I c o u l d talk a
great deal about this film
but s p a c e prevents me f r o m
saying m u c h more other
than that this a film to see
and think about.
T h e film world s e e m s to be
at a bit of a loss for major
themes: space, and disaster
C A B A R E T

Plays
Wins.
Laughter and fun seem to
be going out of fashion,
g l o o m and d e s p o n d e n c y
are b e c o m i n g the rage, but
not at the Vaudeville. Here,
two masters treat their
audience to a true banquet
of wit talent, melody and
fun. Richard Stilgoe is not
just a c o m e d i a n , he is also
a lyricist and musician. T h e
combination of these three
skills makes him a s h o w
man of great appeal. S o m e
of his s o n g s are simply
hilarious, s o m e are very
sharp, they are all topical.
Peter Skellern by
c o m p a r i s o n is the
personification of art. A
gifted pianist and a
songwriter of s o m e note,
he gets the opportunity to
display his creativity on
one or two o c c a s i o n s
without interruption from
his bearded, b o u n c y friend.
The two of them fill the
s h o w perfectly. There is
sufficent surprise in the
repetoire to ensure that the
whole audience is wrapped
in concentration and there
is sufficent humour to raise
a laugh a minute. Stilgoe
and Skellern work well
together, their timing is
perfect and contains an
element that cannot be
perfected by rehearsal.
Whatever your education,
y o u will laugh at them.
They entertain the musical
Maestro and the Social
Worker alike—see them if
you need cheering up.
have been covered, but
recently there has been a
minor revival in the
Western, and the latest
example of this is the
L a w r e n c e K a s d a n film
Silverado. S o m e people
have expressed the belief
that this may well be the
last big Western, if that is
so then it's a fine swan
s o n g for the genre.
All the performances are
excellent but I particularly
enjoyed Kevin Kline's easy
going c o w b o y and L i n d a
Hunt's shrewd saloon
owner, both of w h o m have
wonderfully infectious
smiles. I am tempted to say
more about the hat as an
icon in the Western, but I'd
probably lose my readers,
so instead I'll just say that
this is a real Y e e - h a film
and I loved it.
Very briefly, because I
want to pass over this one
as quickly as possible, and
because it doesn't even
deserve the small amount
of publicty that this review
will give it, Best Defence.
This film provides an
interesting c o m p a r i s o n with
L a w r e n c e Kasdan's
because William H u y c k , the
director and co-writer of
Best Defence, wrote the
weaker of the Star Wars
and Indiana J o n e s series of
screen plays and K a s d a n
wrote the better ones. T h u s
w h e n both are given free
reign on their own projects
the difference is
unmissable.
This dreadful film also
abuses the talents of two
very funny people, Dudley
M o o r e as the defence
research scientist and
Eddie Murphy as the tank
driver demonstrating the
w e a p o n at a Middle Eastern
sales drive. Passing over
the suspect morals of the
involvement that M u r p h y
has in a war he stumbles
on to I w o u l d however like
to mention that dreadful
script which is full of
laboured double entendres
and the sort of material that
is about as funny as being
run over by a tank. G o and
see the other films instead.
