Y o u might have imagined
that, being a students'
union, IC U n i o n w o u l d
have policy on a c a d e m i c
affairs However, you w o u l d
be wrong. H u m a n rights in
C h i l e may be well covered,
but the U n i o n doesn't have
a view on teaching
standards, examinations,
c o u r s e content, etc.
Hopefully this situation will
be put to rights at next
T u e s d a y ' s U n i o n G e n e r a l
Meeting. Of course the full
text of the p r o p o s e d new
policy will be circulated in
'Exec News', but in
anticipation that this might
not be too widely read, I
am s u m m a r i s i n g the main
points in this article.
Teaching Standards
The main points of the
proposed policy are that
lecturers should receive
s o m e training in how to
present lectures in an
interesting and coherent
manner, and that teaching
performance s h o u l d be
seen as an important factor
for lecturer promotion. It
also calls for the 'associate
lecturer s c h e m e ' used by
the Physics department,
whereby two or more
lecturers collaborate on
each lecture course rather
than leaving it to just o n e
person, to be extended as
widely as possible.

Course Content and Design
In theory, most students
are allowed to do s o m e
Humanities options as part
of their course. However,
there are often obstacles
placed in the way of doing
them, s u c h as timetable
clashes. Also, the marks
given for such courses are
often unrealistically low
given the amount of work
involved. There s h o u l d be a
realistic provision for
humanites options in all
courses, and the p r o p o s e d
new policy is pressing for
this.
T h e introduction of the
M E n g degree is the most
important new development
since four year courses
started. Its introduction is
to be w e l c o m e d , even if it
is rather belated. But the
C o l l e g e still has m u c h
more to do before four year
courses get the recognition
from industry that they
were intended to have.
Examinations
T h e proposed policy calls
for all courses to offer
September re-sits or
supplementary assesment,
at least for those who fail in
the first year. A large
J Martin Taylor
number of students who
presently have to have a
year off w o u l d then be able
to carry on into their
s e c o n d year. In
departments where re-sits
are held the failure rate is
noticably lower.
Women Students
There are two problems
when it c o m e s to
recruitment of a higher
number of w o m e n students
to IC. First, more effort
must be made in s c h o o l s to
ensure that girls are not
d i s c o u r a g e d from studying
s c i e n c e subjects,
particularly at the age of
thirteen or fourteen when
they make their c h o i c e of
O-level subjects. T h e new
policy will press for action
by the College, along with
other universities, to
improve s c h o o l liason at
this level.
S e c o n d , this C o l l e g e
needs to improve its image
so that it c a n attract a high
proportion of those w o m e n
w h o do apply for s c i e n c e
and engineering courses.
This is as m u c h a U n i o n
problem as one for the
C o l l e g e authorities, indeed
it is a problem which
deserves consideration by
all staff and students
here—we c a n all do our
part to improve IC's image
in this respect, a n d the
p r o p o s e d new policy
recognises this.
So What?
I feel that as students we
s h o u l d be putting forward
ideas about how university
education can be improved.
In the past those that have
been a d v a n c e d to C o l l e g e by
A c a d e m i c Affairs Officers
have been those that
appealed to them personally,
rather than a U n i o n view.
Hopefully by having U n i o n
policy on the subject our
views will have more weight.
At least I hope it will lead a
few more students to think
about a c a d e m i c affairs, and
if y o u disagree with parts of
the p r o p o s e d policy or you
have other ideas that you
think should be included
then c o m e along to the U G M
and let us hear your views.
J Martin Taylor
Academic Affairs Officer
Women's Officer
At the end of last term I
was co-opted on to the IC
Union C o u n c i l to act as
T e m p o r a r y W o m e n ' s
Officer. What, you may ask,
does a 'Women's Officer'
do, and why am I doing the
job?
Everyone at IC Must be
aware of the very low
percentage of female
students here—this causes
many problems for s o m e of
the w o m e n here and almost
all of us w o u l d like to see
the situation change. There
are many people at C o l l e g e
who feel isolated, lonely,
intimidated, angry, or just
bored with the social
atmophere fostered by the
unequal balance of the
sexes. This isn't to say that
plenty of people don't fully
enjoy their IC social life,
but most w o u l d agree that
more w o m e n around the
place would be a g o o d
thing. This is never going
to happen as long as IC
keeps its terrible image and
its unbalanced atmosphere
which a significant number
of w o m e n (and men) find
Christine Taig
totally off-putting. M a n y
post-graduate w o m e n ,
especially, are apalled at
the contrast between IC
and their previous college.
There are ways in w h i c h
the union c a n improve the
atmosphere here; by
introducing a positive n o n -
sexist policy to rid college
of material which most
w o m e n and many men find
offensive, whether it be
articles in union
publications, posters or rag
mags, by following up,
quickly and effectively,
individual w o m e n ' s
complaints of sexual
harassment by staff or
students; by making it clear
that if more w o m e n are to
c o m e to IC, attitudes within
the union will have to
c h a n g e to make the place
less hostile towards them.
The W o m e n ' s Officer can
not be expected to do this
single-handedly; she will
not be there so that all
women's problems can be
d u m p e d into her lap; but
she will be able to remind
and persuade other c o u n c i l
and executive members to
take action when
necessary. S h e will be
available for individual
w o m e n to discuss
particular problems and
hopefully will follow these
up and give advice as
appropriate, she will
organise s c h e m e s s u c h as
the distribution of rape
alarms, self defence classes
and so on. S h e should also
work in conjuction with the
college senior women's
tutor and the student
counsellor.
Most importantly the
W o m e n ' s Officer will
represent all female IC
students, the post being
similar to that of the post-
grad rep. This doesn't
mean only representing the
'active feminists' or WIST
members at college! I shall
be contacting all w o m e n
students soon (no mean
task—the percentage may
be small but that's still a lot
of p e o p l e — s o this may take
s o m e time!) but in the
mean time if a n y o n e has
c o m m e n t s , criticisms,
questions or ideas as to
what the W o m e n ' s Officer
s h o u l d be doing please
contact me via the U n i o n
Office—leave a note or use
the intercom as I'm in the
building most lunch times.
A s to why I'm doing the
job at the moment at the
last U G M , it was decided
that the post of W o m e n ' s
Officer should be created,
and that she should be
elected by all female
students and have full
speaking and voting rights
on C o u n c i l , the body which
makes most of the decision
on U n i o n policy. However,
because of the U n i o n
consitituiton this post won't
be official until it has been
aproved at two
consecutiave U G M s . Until
this happens the executive
and c o u n c i l thought it
sufficiently important to ask
s o m e b o d y to start doing
the groundwork for the
permanent post. Having
been at the U G M I
volunteered to do the job
and as n o b o d y objected
too strongly, here I am.
