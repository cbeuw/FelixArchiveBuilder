January is sale time out there
in consumer land. Forget that
there's a sale at Allied Carpets
400 days a year. Now is also
the time between getting your
grant cheque and finding
you've got £25 to last for the
rest of the term. So perhaps
like me you'll be going out on
your annual shopping trip, or
maybe now is the time you can
finally afford that immitation
Cappo Dimonte doobery holder
you've always wanted. Anyway
good luck to you as you prop
up good old capitalist society,
bless its cotton socks (£2.99 at
Sparks & Mensa). The object
of this is not to pontificate on
what to buy — if you want a
pair of diamante shin pads
that's your problem and I've
not got the faintest idea where
you'd get them. What I would
like to suggest is that you stock
up on whatever you need for
the next couple of years in
case, as reported nationally
this week, the student grant is

cut by £1100 as a result of
housing benefit changes.
If while you're contemplating
how to save money by spending
pounds you feel like getting out
to see something a little
different may I suggest some
circus. Circus Senso at the
Albany Empire until 18
January is in fact an updating
of the circus idea incorporating
alternative theatre and
dispensing with the repugnant
spectacle of performing
animals (eg I C U G M s ) . The
nearest tube is New Cross and
prices vary (with some special
reductions). See Time O u t for
more details.
Another multiple act which
might be worth seeing is The
Magnificent Seven at the M a n
in the Moon theatre, 392 Kings
Road, on Monday 13 January.
As well as various mime and
alternative entertainments this
includes Covent Garden street
festival winners The Vicious
Boys. Cost is £ 2 . 5 0 / £ J .50 —
cheaper than a film.
But if films are what you
want, two suggestions I'd have
the pomposity to make are
Defence of the Realm at the
Odeon Haymarket and Orion's
belt at Cannon cinemas in
Chelsea or Tottenham Court
Road (these used to be the
Classic cinemas). Both are
political thrillers. Defence of
the Realm concerns a journalist
apparently stumbling on a
parliamentary sex scandal
which then leads to something
nuclear. While Orion's Bell is a
Norweigian story which starts
with some dubious goings on in
the arctic. Both these
suggestions stem partly from
seeing the brilliant but
— I
occasionally O T T Edge of
Darkness on B B C T , compelling
stuff but is plutonium really
like that?!
Such is the appeal of
secrecy, or is it the danger of
secrecy? The field of official
secrecy is the subject of an
event at the Friends Meeting
House, Euston Road on
Tuesday 14 January to be
addressed by a mega-cast of
public figures including David
Steel, Roy Hattersley, Ralph
Nader (who he, ed?) and Clive
Ponting. The Secret Rally is
part of a Time Out-sponsored
freedom of information
campaign and it is suggested
tickets are bought in advance.
And lastly to plug some
suitable live music. Bastions of
the truly alternative scene Here
and Now are currently playing
their farewell tour. The date to
remember is 31 January at
Dingwalls — should be a
goodie! If a bit of psychadelic
revival is what turns you on
man (as I believe they used to
say when I was tripping out on
Marmite butties before
bedtime) then Zodiac
Mindwarp and the Love
Reaction are playing Alice in
Wonderlaijd at Gossips - Dean
Street on 13 January. Zodiac
and C o recently supported D r
and the Medics (who are now
so 'cult' it is difficult to get
into the same universe they are
playing). It's recommended
that you don't stand too close
to the P A if you don't want
your mind warped too much.
Finally I hope there will s6on
be some details of a Cramps
tour in this country in
February. C a n your newspaper
