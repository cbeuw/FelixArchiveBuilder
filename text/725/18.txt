Dear F E E L S I C K ,
I must c o m p l a i n about the
disgusting state of the
U n i o n Print Unit. Whilst I
appreciate that this is
probably d u e to the b u n c h
of mindless h a c k s that y o u
allow to use it most of the
year. I still think y o u c o u l d
do something about it. Just
last week I w a s p r o d u c i n g a
paste-up in there a n d it
took me two days to find a
pair of scissors. T h e dismal
state of s o m e of the
equipment is beginning to
m a k e the C C U offices look
exemplary — thse s o - c a l l e d
journalists are obviously a
b u n c h of animals.
Further, it has c o m e to
my attention that the s o -
called Print Unit Manager,
M r H u g h Soirthey, is
neglecting his job. Contrary
to the image he puts about
of a hard-working
insomniac, he s e e m s to
s p e n d all his time 'on the
piss' with the H o c k e y C l u b .
It s e e m s M r S o u t h e y is s o
dedicated to the 'lads' that
he s e e m e d willing to risk
risk his valuable, a n d
already broken, thumb at
the e x p e n s e of s p e n d i n g
Saturday rescuing his
failing newspaper. If things
carry o n like this, I shall be
obliged to steal the printing
press a n d d o the job
myself.
Yours,
Mark Cottle
Dear H u g h ,
Well the best o n e w a s when
we all fell asleep on the
tube o n the w a y back from
the Field C u p we were
standing o n the Earl's
C o u r t platform and C o r n s
went up to this g u y a n d
said 'fuck off, Shitface' it
was really funny w e all
pissed ourselves a n d then
he got his plunker out a n d
pissed all over the live rail
in front of these three old
w o m e n I'm surprised he
didn't get z a p p e d and then
we all c h u n d e r e d up the
curry we'd had an hour
ago, it w a s really great a n d
then...

Dear F E E L S I C K
I w a s distressed to s e e
there were n o references to
the B i s h o p of D u r h a m in
last week's sports page. I
w o u l d have thought y o u
might have mentioned his
refreshing views o n the
subject of the 12 disciples,
namely that they obviously
constitute a s o c c e r team
plus substitute. H e quoted
recently from the writings
of St J o h n the Divine a n d
the R o m a n S p o r t s
C o r r e s p o n d e n t , G r e a v s i c u s
on the subject of the
C r u c i f i x i o n . T h e B i s h o p has
made it clear that J e s u s
was crucified in the press
after the defeat of the team
D y n a m o Bethlehem, of
:which he w a s manager, by
A r i m a t h e a Athletic in the
final of the H e r o d T r o p h y .
P e r h a p s it w a s too m u c h to
hope for s u c h enlightened
views to appear in your
G o d l e s s magazine.

Dear Sir,
I a m writing to c o m p l a i n
about the lack of G o d in
recent F E E L S I C K S . I
noticed that y o u r story o n
the replacing the locks o n
the Tizard e n d of S o u t h s i d e
with booby-trapped
c o m b i n a t i o n devices that
let off c l o u d s of mustard
gas when tripped contained
no reference to the great
sacrifice made for humanity
by o u r lord J e s u s Christ
when he died o n the C r o s s .
L o c k s are an important part
of everyday life, a n d s o it
was disconcerting not to
find any mention of prayer
in the entire article or even
a quote from G e n e s i s
C h 1 4 , v2.
I feel that these
o m m i s i o n s are
unforgivable, b e c a u s e it is
well known that the only
people w h o count are
Christians. Atheists,
agnostics, a n d C a t h o l i c s
can all g o to Hell as far as I
a m c o n c e r n e d .
Yours
