New Year
H a p p y new year everyone.
A U T Strike
Next W e d n e s d a y the A U T ,
the lecturers' union, is
organising a day of action.
This designed to make the
public aware of the
government's failure to
invest in higher education.
T h e A U T is traditionally a
moderate union. Indeed
s o m e of their leaders' lack
of experience in organising
strike action is almost
c o m i c a l . T h e A U T , t h o u g h ,
has d e c i d e d that the
present government's lack
of support for higher
education is so serious that
they should strike.
Students have suffered
appaling cuts in real terms
in grants and benefits.
Imperial C o l l e g e students
have never really taken part
in protests about the
present cuts. T h e last
grants march was
supported by well under 50

students. Recently the
government a n n o u n c e d
cuts in H o u s i n g Benefit and
a 2 % rise in student grants.
It is about time that
apathetic IC students got
off their arses and
protested. W h y not write a
letter to your M P or lobby
him/her. A s a start why not
support the A U T strike and
boycott lectures. If your
lecturers are prepared to
protest about lack of
funding for your education,
surely you should join their
protest.
Hon Porn Night
T h e decision by the R S M U
R u g b y C l u b to hold the
Honorary Pornographer's
Night s h o w s them to be
amazingly naive. In this
issue of FELIX J Martin
Taylor, I C U A c a d e m i c
Affairs Officer and
Christine Taig,"Women's
Officer both write about the
need for Imperial C o l l e g e
to attract more w o m e n .
Unfortunately both of them
failed to mention H o n
P o m ' s Night. H o n P o m ' s
Night is the sort of event
that gives IC it's reputation
for being sexist. Until we
lose this reputation we will
have problems attracting
w o m e n to IC. We must try
to attract more w o m e n ,
then maybe we wouldn't
need to gawp at them on a
film screen.

Benefit Update
Welfare Assistant, Lesley Gillingham, follows up her last feature on benefits
with an update for those of you who bothered to apply. If you have an questions
contact Lesley in Student Services.
A n y o n e who has submitted
a claim for benefit over the
last year (1985) should read
the relevant section of this
article.
If you are experiencing
difficulties with any
benefits, please call into
Student Services a n d see
Lesley, the Welfare Adviser.
1. Unemployment benefit
A n y o n e who read the
article at the end of last
term in F E L I X and
submitted a claim for
U n e m p l o y m e n t benefit in
the Christmas vacation will
have realised that trying to
claim this particular benefit
c o u l d , and probably did,
prove difficult due to
eligibility rules. A s long as
y o u had paid e n o u g h
National Insurance
contributions in the
relevant tax year(s) you
should have had no trouble
in submitting a claim. If
you applied and have
received a giro â€” well
done! If you have not
heard, or have been
disallowed, call into
Student Services and let us
check for y o u . D e c i s i o n s
have been wrong in the
past and appeals have been
successful. Immediate
action is required as only a
limited amount of time is
allowed in which to make a
claim. Please bring
evidence of your claim and
any c o r r e s p o n d e n c e with
the U n e m p l o y m e n t Benefit
Office.
2. Housing benefit
(vacation)
It is probably too early to
worry if you have not heard
about your C h r i s t m a s
vacation claim but if you
have heard nothing by the
beginning of February, call
into the Student Services
Office. T h e " c h a s i n g up"
procedure can then begin.
If you are claiming from
H a m m e r s m i t h and F u l h a m
and have already submitted
a claim for term-time and
did not receive form H B 8
from the benefit office, call
into Student Services to get
one. It must be submitted
immediately, otherwise
your H o u s i n g Benefit will
not be reassessed and you
will not receive any extra
money for this vacation.
3. Housing benefit (term-
time)
Most people will have
received an assessment. If
you haven't or you think
you have been wrongly
assessed, check. Write to
the H o u s i n g Benefit Office
requesting a breakdown of
the assessment. Without
this, nothing can be
c h e c k e d . If you disagree
with the breakdown or
think that you have been
forgotten, call into the
Student Services office and
we will phone for you.
4. Housing benefit (pre-
1985-86)
A n y o n e still waiting to
receive money or
assessment for last
a c a d e m i c year, particularly
from Westminster H o u s i n g
Benefit Office, s h o u l d
contact Student Services
immediately. It is still
possible to appeal
especially in the light of
recent decision c o n c e r n i n g
one student's claim, in
which the H o u s i n g Benefit
Office insisted that his file
had lapsed due to the
length of time his claim had
been outstanding,
eventually his file was re-
opened and reassessed! If
you think you may have
been forgotten and you
made a claim over six
months ago, call in. We
need to act asap.
Supplementary benefit and
Certified Housing Benefit
Students who stayed in
L o n d o n over the C h r i s t m a s
vacation and claimed
supplementary benefit and
certificated housing benefit
- how did you get o n ? Of
particular interest to
Student Services are claims
submitted by students
residing in Halls or H o u s e s
over the vacation.
The government's white
paper on the social security
review makes it very clear
that the government is
determined to prevent
students claiming
supplementary benefit a n d
unemployment benefit in
the short vacations and
housing benefit if living in
college halls of residence.
We need to know how
many people were
successful in these claims
so we can see how many
students are really going to
be affected by the c h a n g e
in the regulations. These
new regulations should be
implemented by September
1986.
If you are having
difficulties with benefits of
any kind or would like
more information on what
you are eligible to claim
for, at present, see Lesley
in the Student Services
Office.
