Christmas Conundra Revealed.
In the C h r i s t m a s Edition of FELIX, Megabrain and the Energise S p o c k
C a m p a i g n presented six devious dilemmas for your delectation. T h e
answers to five of them are presented below just to prove that they
can be done. There are two ways to check your solution to the
wordsearch. T h e first is to laboriously search for every word in the
grid below. T h i s will probably take as m u c h time as solving the
puzzle. T h e s e c o n d method is to read the unused letters from left to
right and top to bottom. T h e y s h o u l d spell out a head-line from F E L I X
no 717 (18th O c t o b e r 1 9 8 5 ) — ' S C O O T F O R Y O U R H O O T ' . Solutions
to the other non prize puzzles are also given with as m u c h
explanation as possible.
We have received several enteries
for the cryptic c r o s s w o r d and so
the correct answer is printed
here. T h e winner has been
a n n o u n c e d in this weeks
Editorial. Unfortunately, we have
had no solutions for the Electric
nightmare. For once, we are
puzzled! It really is easy (once
you know the answer) and
requires no c o m p l e x algebra and
very little physics. We still have
the £5 prize for this c o n u n d r u m ,
so we will leave the competiton
o p e n for one more week. A s an
extra clue, try to use symmetry in
the solution.
T h e 3cm measurement in this
puzzle is a red herring. S i m p l e
geometry gives us a rule about
the diagonals of a rectangle
being the s a m e length. Well, a
rectangle is marked in the
diagram below, o n e diagonal was
given as 8cm, hence the other
one, w h i c h happens to be a radius, is also
8 c m — E a s y wasn't
T h e trick here is to realise what the sentence
(or sentances) are about. This can be d o n e
simply, by reading the end of the
passage:...had had had pleased the teacher.
T h e last four words make sense, they are a
past tense verb 'had pleased' and an object
'the teacher'. T o complete the sentence, a
subject is required. T h e beginning of the
passage is a long way back, and there are no
other nouns than those in the first three
words. S o the subject can only be a
quotation—of a past tense of the verb to
be—'had had' had pleased the teacher.

now realise X+4

Firstly, look at it from Ann's point of view. Her last
statement indicates that she has narrowed it
down to two possibilities, one of which has a one
as its second figure. There are 31 perfect squares
from 13 ito 1300 which gives far too many
possibilities, so it must be a perfect cube. The
perfect cubes between 13 and 1300 are:
27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000 of which 64
and 729 are perfect squares. The answers to the
first two questions must have left two of these. If
it was less than 500 and a perfect square this
would leave just 64 so those weren't the answers
Ann got. Less than 500 and not a perfect square
gives three possiblities and is also wrong.
Greater that 500 and a perfect square leaves just
729 and is wrong. Thus the answers Ann got
must have been: Greater than 500 and not a
perfect square, which leaves 512 and 100. Since
these were both lies, the actual number is less
than 500 and a perfect square i.e. 64.
Thus there are 64 members of TT Soc in Bob's
department.

This week we have a
linguistic puzzle to keep you
busy. There are 9,864,100
possible combinations of
these ten letters, not all of
which are words in the
English language, but how
many are 7 You may only
use each letter once. The
person that hands in the
most words that can be
found in the Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary by 1.00
pm Monday will be handed a
five pound note ( A f t e r
they've been checked-so no
cheating) ! By the way, there
is at least one ten-letter
word.
T h e picture s h o w n below was not a
puzzle. S o all those of y o u w h o

Opinion
Hon Porn's Night
At the end of last term, R S M U Rugby Club held their Hon Porn's Night. R S M U President,
Dave Pearce justifies the club's decisions to hold the event.
This is one of the more
controversial issues in IC. I
feel it is now time to reply
to all those w h o
c o n d e m n e d the R S M U for
holding it.
It is a s h o w which is
organised by the R S M
R u g b y C l u b . It is held o n c e
a year and usually involves
two female strippers and a
n u m b e r of pornographic
films.
In my first year, 1983, 400
people attended-more than
most U G M ' s — d u e to the
interest c a u s e d by the
controversy. In 1984, it was
moved to an alternative
venue due to certain
o p p o n e n t s in IC failing to
cancel it at the ballot box,
inviting outside colleges to
picket it and national press
to report it. T h e Rector,
then Lord Flowers, asked
the R S M U President to
move it away from IC or
cancel it, w h i c h he did.
This year it went ahead as
it had always been
traditionally, quietly and
watched by members of the
R S M U R u g b y C l u b .
Having explained the
event and its recent history,
I will try and s u m m a r i s e the
objections. It is said to be
sexist and degrading to
w o m e n , because of their
employment in sex acts on
screen for a predominantly
male market.
I agree that it is sexist, by
definition, b e c a u s e it is
made for a predominantly,
but not wholly, male
market. But that's not the
point. If manufacture of
bras is sexists as it caters
for a solely female market.
T h e point is, is it degrading
to w o m e n ? Do the
audienge c o m e away
feeling that w o m e n are for
sex o n l y ?
I feel not and for the
following reasons:
Firstly the audience do
not watch it for sexual
pleasure—that's difficult
with d o z e n s of others
watching—rather the thrill
c o m e s from watching
something socially taboo.
S e c o n d l y , sex is a natural
act. H u m a n s find it
pleasuable, surely no
accident of G o d . But at the
s a m e time you know that
the feelings behind the sex
on the screen are just acted
and not real.
Thirdly it is said to be
immoral, w h o decides these
morals? If the majority in
society had d e c i d e d them
then it would be illegal.
A n y natural act regarded as
immoral makes people feel
guilty a n d suffer the
degradation and character
destruction that g o e s with
it—surely that is w r o n g ?
Fourthly, it is held but
o n c e a year. T h i s cannot
overwhelm a mind with
repacious lust.
Fifthly, w h e n I c a m e
away from s u c h a night I
didn't go and maltreat any
w o m e n . I still have the
respect that I went into the
event with. Rather, I leave
with a broader mind having
seen the event and made
my o w n mind up about it.
Realise this too, we in the
R S M , feel very strongly that
we decide what we do
(within the law of course).
We're not animals or
i m b e c i l e s — w e need 'A'
levels as well. In the next
few weeks there will be a
questionnaire going round
R S M asking U n i o n m e m b e r
n u m e r o u s questions
including their view on H o n
Porns.
N o I don't think H o n
Porns is degrading to
w o m e n , but thank you for
the controversy that has
made me think, d i s c u s s and
realise this.
David Pearce
President
RSMU.
