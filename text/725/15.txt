Ennals Quits in Star
Wars Protest
Richard Ennals, the
Research Manager of the
Computing Department and
logic programming
coordinator for the Alvey
programme, has resigned
in protest at the SDI
project. Mr Ennals, a key
figure in the Alvey
programme which is
researching into to the next
generation of 'super
computers', announced his
resignation at the British
Computer Society Debate
on SDI.
Mr Ennals is c o n c e r n e d
that SDI will not be
feasable and fears that the
Government will push for a
greater military stake in
Alvey, using the funding
review due in 1988 as
leeverage. He explained in
a G u a r d i a n interview that
'the intention of all the
designers has been to
p r o d u c e powerful s y s t e m s
for civil use.'
Professor B r u c e Sayers,
head of the C o m p u t i n g
department, c o m m e n t e d
that the Alvey project's
funding d e p e n d e d only on
'how well the project was
going' and that extra
money would c o m e from
industry if the governments
funding were reduced.
Mr Ennals is also
c o n c e r n e d that, following
remarks made by Defence
Secretary Micheal Heseltine
during C o m m o n s
questioning, work on SDI
will take resources away
from Alvey. Mr Heseltine,
although 'enthusiastic'
about Alvey was unable to
guarantee that SDI would
not divert resources from
the civil work on Alvey to
military work.
C o l l e a g u e s have
described Mr Ennals
resignation as a 'very brave
move'. Professor Sayers
said that the resignation
would 'have no effect' on
SDI or Alvey and added
that a new appointment
had already been arranged.

' P r o g r e s s i n g '
A n d r e w Healey, the
chemistry student who was
admitted into hospital with
Thallium poisoning last
term, was reported to be
'progressing' and 'in m u c h
better spirits' earlier this
week. Mr Healey has been
in intensive care in C h a r i n g
C r o s s Hospital since Friday
N o v e m b e r 22.
T h e Philip laboratory,
where Mr Healey had been
working, has remained
closed since he was taken
ill. P o l i c e are still
investigating the incident.
Prof Attacks Funding
Professor Sir Geoffrey
Wilkinson, head of the
Chemistry Department,
criticised the poor funding
of research and teaching in
Britain when he was
featured in an Observer
article on D e c e m b e r 29.
Professor Wilkinson, a
Nobel Prize-winner, said
that funds were insufficient
to train students in the
numbers required by
industry. He cited the
Chemistry Department at
IC as an example; only
£220,000 was left after
salaries had been deductec
from the department's
budget of £1.2million. He
was also quoted as saying
that a ludicrous proportion
of the country's basic
science budget was spent
on nuclear physics.
Professor Wilkinson
described the acute lack of
funds for research students
as 'very worrying' when he
s p o k e to F E L I X on
Tuesday. He said that the
situation was particularly
bad in chemistry, where
costs are high because of
the large c o n s u m p t i o n of
materials, especially oil
based chemicals. At IC the
chemistry department
accounts for arround 50%
of the C o l l e g e ' s
expenditure on materials.
In addition the S E R C
provide only y3 of the cost
to the department of each
research student, a figure
of around £2000.
Professor Wilkinson
confirmed that there was
too m u c h emphasis on
research into high energy
nuclear physics. H e said
that this work was not
likely to be of m u c h
c o m m e r c i a l benefit, and
added that teaching core
sciences should be a
priority.

The U n i o n Bar o p e n e d
under Union control for the
first time last Friday. T h i s

negociating for the bar by
U n i o n sabbaticals. Deputy
President Dave Kingston
said that trade in the bar
s e e m e d to be increasing.
He a d d e d that he was
pleased that a large
number of Beit Hall
residents were using the
bar. W h e n asked by F E L I X
if he had any plans for
c h a n g i n g the bar in the
immediate future, he said
that he hoped to e x p a n d
