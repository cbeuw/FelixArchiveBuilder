RSM
N o w seems a g o o d time to
reflect on what h a p p e n e d
during the first term and to
look ahead to this c o m i n g
term. I think the first term
went very smoothly and yet
again we provided the best,
and best attended, J C R
parties. We shall be having
a few more this term,
including the infamous
'Mines Review'. We hope
you'll c o m e along to
support that and y o u
should be able to see 'The
Greatest S h o w on Legs',
(you know, the B a l l o o n
Dance, etc).
T h a n k s to all those w h o
helped and c a m e along to
the H o n P o m ' s night in
Foreign Students
W e e k — m o s t of us are still
wondering what all the fuss
> is about!
T h e big event this term is
the C a m b o r n e weekend on
Feb 8—in fact it's probably
che most important
weekend of the year. We're
hoping to take 3 or 4
c o a c h e s full of teams and
supporters, so make sure
you join us for the trip of a
lifetime. T o w a r d s the end
of the Easter vacation we
are planning a R u g b y team
visit to the Delft S c h o o l of
Mines in Holland. We also
need supporters, and we
can guarantee that all w h o
attend will have a great
time, since the Dutch are
s u c h g o o d hosts.
T o raise money for R a g
we are planning to have a
virtually non-stop football
match or competiton
lasting for a few days. We
need lots of teams for that,
so look out for it.
I hope you all had a g o o d
rest at Christmas and are
refreshed for this c o m i n g
term.
Finally, we have the
R S M U Elections at the end
of the term, so if y o u fancy
taking up a Union post,
start asking this year's
officer about it, and get
elected.
We're going to keep y o u
busy this week with four
solid days of entertainment
and enjoyment. For starters
there is the first instalment
of auditions for this term's
plays, Kennedy's Children
by Robert Patrick and a
radio play Albert's Bridge
by T o m Stoppard. We don't
just need actors either, If
you're interested in doing
things like c o s t u m e
research then please c o m e
along. Meet in the U p p e r
L o u n g e at 2.30pm on
Sunday.
O n M o n d a y and T u e s d a y
are the two broadcasting of
Peter Shaffer's play Equus
on IC Radio: the first time
this play has ever been
staged on the radio. S o
listen to the IC Radio on
999/kHz and catch up with
it one evening.
W e d n e s d a y brings the
s e c o n d half of auditions for
Kennedy's Children and
Albert's Bridge in case you
couldn't make it on
Sunday. A g a i n , it takes
place at 2.30pm in the
U p p e r L o u n g e .
Postgrad
Group
Hello to all you 15U0
Postgrads out there. T h e
P G group is alive and
functioning, albeit behind
the scenes. T o any of y o u
with specific P G problems I
am still available to help on
6204/6289/3500 (IC Union)
or drop me a note to M e c h
Eng. In a c c o r d a n c e with
U G M and C o u n c i l policy,
the P G G r o u p committee
will accept a W o m e n ' s
officer to be co-opted onto
the C o m m i t t e e to deal with
specific P G W o m e n s
problems. There will be an
informal meeting on
T u e s d a y 14th J a n u a r y
when any w o m e n wanting
to be the P G W o m e n ' s
officer s h o u l d introduce
themselves to the meeting.
It will be from 12.30pm to
about 2.00pm in the
Holland club over
p l o u g h m a n s lunches and
hopefully this 'event' will
continue fortnightly
d e p e n d i n g on how many
turn up.

Cricket
The England 'B' T o u r to
Bangladesh may have been
cancelled but IC cricket
club lives on. If there is
anyone out there w h o is
interested in playing cricket
whatever standard then the
nets at Lords continues

are still a few people yet to
be invited. A n y o n e who has
not been invited yet, or
those who did not sign up
at Fresher's Fair, please
drop a note to me, in M e c h

and another meeting before
the end of term. A n y
further queries to me will
be gratefully received.
