enthusiastic audience how to do the T i m e - W a r p from the

Smith Scandal
College Secretary, John Smith, enjoys a good dance just
like everyone else. However, he likes to be reminded of his
I time in the Gilbert and Ellis Islands. Grass skirts are hard
to come by in Godalming, and so Mr Smith had to make
do with a little number from Littlewoods. He can be seen
here enjoying himself with a few friends in the traditional
: 'Coconut Dance'.

asort Shocker
Dave Kingston, I C U Deputy
President, has revealed that
he is in fact a m a s o n . T h e
Society of F r e e m a s o n s has
many m e m b e r s holding
influential jobs in C o l l e g e ,
though no-one s u s p e c t e d
h o w low the organisation
had sunk in its search for
new m e m b e r s until now. It
is believed that Mr
Kingston has s u d d e n l y
been offered the
chairmanship of Nurk and
Dingbat, a directorship with
United Sprockets, and a
seat in Parliament. However
Mr Kingston denied that
being a mason had
anything to with gaining
these posts, claiming
instead that they were
offered on the strength of
his abilities.
It was realised that M r
Kingston had b e c o m e a
mason at a meeting of the
B o a r d of A c a d e m i c Studies
( B O A S ) on Tuesday. W h e n
he shook hands with
C o l l e g e Secretary, J o h n
Smith, Mr Kingston was
heara to exclaim loudly,
" W o w ! W h i c h lodge are
y o u ? " M r Smith is
understood to have buried
his face in his hands at this
point.
S u s p i c i o n s arose that Mr
Kingston was trying to join
w h e n , at a recent C o l l e g e
dinner, he asked well-
known F r e e m a s o n , Frank
Roysis, "if I give you Bot-
Z o o and the U D H , c a n I
j o i n ? " C o m m e n t i n g on the
development, Mr R o y s i s
said, "I never thought we'd
let a plonker like him in,
but times are hard."
Frog Farce
John Smith (right) and a few friends
Students in the Physics
Department staged a
walkout en masse
yesterday, after a senior
lecturer told the 'Wide-
Mouth Frog' joke. Protests
were first raised by the
students when Professor
Newt had reached the point
where the frog meets an
elephant. However their
complaints went unnoticed,
and the breaking point
c a m e when the lecturer
recanted the punch-line of,
" y o u don't meet many of
those round here."
W h e n interviewed by
F E E L S I C K , J o e Pratt, a
s p o k e s m a n for the students
said, "lecturers don't take
their c o u r s e s seriously
e n o u g h . O n e even throws
bits of paper at us."
However Professor Newt
told F E E L S I C K that
students lack a sense of
humour, and he felt the
joke was quite relevant to a
c o u r s e on ' A m p h i b i a n
Behaviour in Relation to
Statistical Q u a n t u m
Mechanics'.
