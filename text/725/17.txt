Phew, What
A Scorcher
The full extent of plans for the Union Building were revealed in a document
which came into the possession of FEELSICK earlier this week. The document,
a memo prepared by John Smith for the College Secretary's Planning Group,
was accidentally mailed to Student Services by Mr Smith's bungling minion
Michael Arthur. From there it was passed to our reporter by Union Spy, Dave
Parry. Both sources asked not to be named, but because we like to think we
are going to work for the Guardian, we shopped them.
In the m e m o M r S m i t h
outlines radical proposals for
creating more s p a c e in the
U n i o n Building. H e intends that
the U n i o n should move all its
facilities to the s p a c e left at
Harlington after the gravel has
been excavated there. T h e
U n i o n will be taking up
residence in several h o u s e b o a t s
and an old barge in the lake
formed by the gravel
excavations. T o c o m p e n s a t e for
the loss of all but one of its
sports pitches, C o l l e g e will buy
the U n i o n a large number of
table tennis tables and intends
to resurface the Q u e e n s L a w n
with Astroturf. In the estimated
three year interim period
between now and the
completion of landscape
gardening at Harlington the
U n i o n is to be temporarily
housed in the nuclear reactor at
S i l w o o d . P r o d u c t i o n of
F E E L S I C K will be contracted
out to Eddie S h a h ' s printworks
at W a p p i n g . It is thought that,
like Mr S h a h ' s paper, F E E L S I C K
will not be printed in colour.
T h e large amount of s p a c e
released is to be used by Nirex,
w h o are currently looking at
proposals for sites to store
m e d i u m and high level
radioactive waste. A s p o k e s m a n
that at the four other sites they
had encountered strong local
objections, but the C o l l e g e
administration had been very
receptive to their proposals. It is
believed that Beit Hall will not
have lead shielding installed,
but will instead be incorporated
into the B i o l o g y A n i m a l H o u s e ,
for study of the long-term
effects of radiation on students.
U s e of the radioactive material
will also cut drastically the fuel
bills for the Beit Building.
C o n c e s s i o n s were made by
C o l l e g e to the U n i o n in the
c o u r s e of negotiations. Free
c o l o s t o m y bags are to be made
available to students from the
U n i o n Bar to aid incontinence
problems in sabbaticals. Also,
places on Aeronautical
Engineering c o u r s e s will be
made available to those
sabbaticals w h o wish to run for
U L U Presidency.
Carl B u r g e s s and Dave
Kingston said they were "very
pleased with the deal". I C U
C o u n c i l has been c a n c e l l e d for
the next five years as Q u e n t i n
Fontana felt that further
d i s c u s s i o n s within the U n i o n
w o u l d prejudice the issue, a n d
that the matter of the U n i o n
moving was "too trivial to
warrant d i s c u s s i o n at C o u n c i l " .
C o l l e g e Secretary, J o h n
Smith was unavailable for
c o m m e n t on any of the above
proposals, as he was busy
arranging the purchase of a
yacht on w h i c h to retire to
Barbados. T h e Rector, Eric A s h
said that he had not been
informed of the matter by M r
Smith, and that M r B u r g e s s was
"too incoherent for a n y o n e to
undertand what he was talking
about" when they last met.
O n behalf of the U n i o n , Mr
Burgess said,"I feel this is a
very advantageous move for the
U n i o n . All I've had in return is
load of grief. Students really
piss me off."
Fergie Denies All
Fergie has denied all
knowledge of being
engaged to Prince A n d r e w ,
in an exclusive revelation to
F E E L S I C K yesterday.
Fergie told F E E L S I C K at a
press conference at the tiny
Kensington flat, " H e never
proposed to me. There's
absolutely nothing between
us. It's a complete
fabrication."
Despite Fergie's fervent
denials, intrepid F E E L S I C K
reporters waited patiently
for any signs of Royal
messengers to take Prince
Andrew's regards to Fergie.
However, after many hours
of waiting outside Student
Services in Prince's
G a r d e n s it was decided
that no-one was going to
turn up. D o n F e r g u s o n is
thought to be relieved that
Prince A n d r e w has not
proposed to him. Sarah Ferguson
