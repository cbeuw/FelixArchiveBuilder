In films Irishmen are
usually portrayed as either
loudmouth drunks or born
entertainers. M o o r e Lyttle
definitely fits most easily
into the latter category,
thankfully he has the
landlord's knack of putting
his customers at ease and
serving beer at the same
time, something sadly
lacking in recent weeks.
He's not a stranger to
Imperial either having
worked regularly in C o l l e g e
bars for a few years
culminating in 1981 with a
six month spell as manager
of Southside Bar.
Ironically he now finds
himself in direct
competition with S o u t h s i d e
w h i c h he readily admits is a
larger and more
comfortable bar with the
great advantage of a ready
made market. In
c o m p a r i s o n the U n i o n is
small and fairly isolated
and has lost many regular
customers during the
turmoil of last term. T h e
Union Bar used to take
more money than
Southside but the
Southside bar has been
extensively modernised
over a period of years while
the U n i o n has been treated
much less favourably.
Part of the unwillingness to
invest in the U n i o n c a n be
blamed on it's reputation as
a haven for heavy drinkers
w h i c h in itself has lost
many customers. T h e bar
d o e s rely on the C C U bar
nights, the drinking and
sports clubs and after
dinner drinkers to bring in
money but M o o r e agrees
that it cannot survive on
these events alone. While
a c k n o w l e d g i n g that the
C o l l e g e has many 'active'
drinkers and that tradition
is particularly important to
the bar he also feels there
is a limit to the behaviour
that is acceptable and most
clubs recognise this and
control their own members
if they step out of line. He
sees the U n i o n as a noisy,
lively bar which could
never have a lounge bar
atmosphere. However,
there is a s e c o n d bar in the
Snack Bar which will
initially open on
W e d n e s d a y lunchtime and
evening and does offer
greater comfort and space.
It is hoped that this bar can
be e x p a n d e d but the extra
staff required can only be
paid if the bar takings
justify it. S T O I C are
currently preparing to
install a television in the
L o u n g e which will show
videos in the eveninings
and it is hoped a
microwave oven can be
reintroduced shortly to
provide hot food
throughout opening hours.
T h e changeover has been
particularly hectic in both
arranging to order supplies
and in tidying up the bar
and this has required a
terrific amount of effort.
M o o r e particularly thanked
Martin Parsons and the
refectories staff for their
help, particularly in
e m p l o y i n g extra staff to get
the bar into shape, and also
the staff of all the other
C o l l e g e bars for their help
and advice. M o o r e is
obviously fully committed
to the job in hand but the
c h a n g e s that need to be
made all require to be
justified by money a c r o s s
the counter. Why not go for
a drink in the Union's
U n i o n Bar tonight?
"Why not
drink in
the
Union's
Union
Bar
tonight?"
