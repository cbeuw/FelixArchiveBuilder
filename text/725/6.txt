A s the new term begins
with a flourish, students
returning from their
holidays with rosy c h e e k s
twinkles in their eyes, a n d
that overwhelming
eagerness to get back to
the a c a d e m i c life, we must
(distasteful as I know it is,
dear children) turn our
eyes to the more sordid
side of Imperial.
Horrified Geoffrey
Hungerford gave Student
Services the kind of telling
off which only the self-
righteous 'hell-fire and
damnation' brigade can do
without realizing just how
p o m p o u s they are really
being. With typical
missionary d i p l o m a c y he
described the male half of
the c o u p l e w h o had
provoked his wrath as a
'playboy' and though
allowing the c o u p l e to
remain in their flat, he
proclaimed indignantly that
he 'would not be there to
let them in in the evening'.
S u c h tolerance is perhaps
the best measure of this
man's 'Christian Charity'.
Graham Brown: College Conservative Looney

before being allowed into

rumoured that strongly

O n the subject of right-
wing loonies, I have
information pertaining to
Hamlet G a r d e n ' s illustrious
warden w h o has been
trying (without s u c c e s s ) to
save the souls of the flock
of students w h o m he
shepherds. Student
Services (an u n g o d l y lot as
we shall see later) have
apparently allowed
students to live in sin, (I'm
sorry, but I had to say it) in
a c c o m m o d a t i o n intended
for married students.
S p e a k i n g of Christians,
that other well k n o w n
Soldier of G o d Mr R o g e r
Preece has been found to
be the source of a puzzling
article submitted
a n o n y m o u s l y for the last
FELIX. It s e e m s Mr Preece
was determined to pre-
empt his a p p e a r a n c e in
Below the Belt by writing
the story himself. A pity
then that our editor
rejected the c o p y as
lacking interest and set his
staff on researching the
matter more deeply.
C o m p l a i n t s have been
levelled against Student
Services finance assistant
Dave Parry. A n d y B e c k has
been trying to a c c u s e him
of not telling him the
correct cost of his rent was
actually less than it was
s u p p o s e d to be. T h o s e in
the know however have
figured out by now that Mr
B e c k is d o i n g nothing more
than carrying out a
vendetta against M r Parry.
This c o n c l u s i o n is justified
by the fact that M r B e c k
has claimed for h o u s i n g
benefit declaring that he
was paying the higher rent.
A n d y B e c k has been
writing letters to us (see
letters page) a c c u s i n g M r
Parry of a 'lack of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n and
interest'. Perhaps s o m e o n e
might like to tell M r B e c k
that we're on to him. 'Nuff
said.
Student Services seem to
be upsetting a lot of people
lately. What about the
famous case of 'The
s n u b b e d Ex-Officer'! Well
the man in question (who
shall remain nameless but
w h o s e initials are M A ) was
sent an invitation to
Student Services C h r i s t m a s
Party, but late e n o u g h to
avoid subjecting the
gathered c o m p a n y of
merry-makers to his
presence. B y s o m e
unfortunate turn of fate,
this gentleman (Michael
Arthur if y o u haven't
g u e s s e d by now) found out
about the party, turned up
on s o m e pretence about
having papers to sign, took
in the s c e n e for an
awkward moment, a n d left
never (they hoped) to be
seen again. M a y b e M A
should try a new dedorant!
S o m e news of our staff
now: Nigel A t k i n s o n ,
F E L I X ' s s l i m m i n g
photographer, looks like he
may lose more than just
weight if his present
w o m a n has her way. A n y
wedding plans for the 'little
and large' c o u p l e c o u l d
mean that old snip, snip for
Big Nige. Pity really, this
means that there won't ever
be a chip off the ever
decreasing A t k i n s o n block.
Lastly presidential
candidates seem to be
j o c k e y i n g for position now
that election time is just
a r o u n d the corner Preecy is
performing publicity stunts
ten to a d o z e n , Christine
Taig has finally gotten onto
c o u n c i l (sort of) and J
Martin Taylor has retuned
from his holidays newly
coiffed (and very nice he
looks tool). W h o k n o w s
what the futre may have in
store...
Well, lots of love
kids...and remember: sex is
great.
