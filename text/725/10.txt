Laughter
At
Carthage.
Michael M o o r c o c k must be
one of the most influential
S F writers of all time. A s
editor of the magazine
'New Worlds' he helped
establish the so called 'New
Wave' w h i c h marked a
definite reaction against
'fantastic future' and 'bug
eyed monster' stories.
M a n y currently well k n o w n
authors owe their first
break to M o o r c o c k while
his own voluminous output
has helped greatly to
dissolve the boundaries
between what is and isn't
S F . His latest book The
Laughter of Carthage
landed on my desk at the
end of last term but
because it is a substantial
read it has taken me until
now to review it.
A single book is not
sufficient to fully
understand M o o r c o c k ' s
writing a n d so, as this is
something of an advert for
the man's books, I shall
ramble on a bit. M a n y of
his books form parts of a
series and in addition there
are a number of themes
and characters w h i c h run
throughout his work.
However for c o m p l e x
reasons, books, chapters
and events are not always
in an order w h i c h c o u l d be
d e s c r i b e d in any way as
chronological. Furthermore
characters may often be
completely different people
from book to book. T h i s
applies particularly to the
Jerry C o r n e l i u s series of
b o o k s which are perhaps
his most unconventional
writings. T o describe
M i c h a e l M o o r c o c k ' s work
as variable is something of
an understatement and to
fully catalogue it w o u l d be
a substantial job, but
a m o n g the better titles The
Elric series and The
Oswald Bastable trilogy are
worth reading.
Laughter of Carthage is a
relatively conventional
novel which with its
predecessor Byzantium
Endures forms part of an
on going series chronicling
o n e C o l o n e l Pyat. T h e two
b o o k s should really be read
in order as Byzantium
Endures contains a short
introduction w h i c h explains
s o m e t h i n g of how the
character arose and the
nature of his memoirs.
Pyat is born on the 1st
J a n u a r y 1900 in Kiev and is
brought up by his mother
and bohemian friends in
the pre and post
revolutionary turmoil of
Southern Russia. His life
and travels take him
through a cross section of
modern history as he
formulates fantastic
s c h e m e s and revolutionary
inventions whilst
continually failing on the
verge of greatness due to
his peculiar personal
qualities. Laughter of
Carthage picks up Pyat's
story as he is fleeing
O d e s s a in 1920 on a
steamer round the Black
S e a and then across
E u r o p e and A m e r i c a up
until 1924.
Pyat is a c o m p e l l i n g
character w h o s e story
s e e m s to be c o n n e c t e d in
s o m e allegorical manner to
the moral history of
twentieth century
civilisation. H e b e c o m e s
involved with many
important movements and
technological innovations
whilst never achieving the
fame he believes he
deserves. Pyat is a genius,
a liar, an addict, an egotist,
a racist and a bigot who
engenders fascination
rather than sympathy. He is
also a survivor and a
visionary. Pyat's dreams
and his view of world
history as a battle between
the mythological influence
of B y z a n t i u m and C a r t h a g e
seem in s o m e way to be an
attempt to explore the way
societies are drawn to
logically ridiculous
philosophies s u c h as
fascism. O n another level
entirely, both Pyat and the
character of Mrs Cornelius,
w h o appears regularly, will
be familiar to a n y o n e w h o
has read the Jerry
C o r n e l i u s books.
S e e m i n g l y yet another
M o o r c o c k cryptic
c o n n e c t i o n .
Laughter of Carthage is
published by Flamingo and
costs Â£4.50 in paperback
w h i c h s e e m s a lot for a
paperback to me, but then
again book prices generally
seem extortionate these
days.
'I mean, if I was up there
acting out, I would be
classifiably insane. There is
a big difference between
acting and acting out.
Acting out is some guy
showing his genitals to
wicked old ladies in Hyde
Park, and I don't do that.'
