T e a and coffee are the two
most popular hot drinks
world wide; s o it s e e m s
surprising that while a
great deal is known about
their chemical c o m p o s i t i o n ,
m u c h less is known about
the processes involved in
brewing.
Dr M Spiro of the
Chemistry Department at
Imperial C o l l e g e has been
looking into the kinetics of
tea and coffee infusion;
that is the rate at w h i c h
water soluble constituents
are extracted from the tea
leaves or coffee particles
during brewing. S i n c e
s o m e types of tea a n d
coffee c a n contain as many
as three hundred different
chemicals, the research
focuses o n the extraction
of the more important
c o n s t i t u e n t s such as
caffeine and the aflavins,
(which give tea it's red
colour). A series of
experiments have
investigated the way factors

s u c h as temperature, size
of particles, p H , a n d
stirring c a n influence this
process.
O n e interesting result of
their work is that the rate of
infusion does not increase
with stirring. Althougth this
might seem surprising, it is
consistent with traditional
recipes for tea making
w h i c h suggest there should
be little or no stirring
during brewing. However,
one factor that d o e s have a
large influence o n the
process is the particle size,
with finely divided tea or
coffee having a greatly
e n h a n c e d rate of infusion.
T h e rate is actually
dependant on the inverse
square of the radius of the
coffee particle, or the
inverse square of the
thickness of the tea leaf.
Other experiments looking
at the effect of varying p H
s h o w that-for some
c o m p o n e n t s like the
aflavins the rate is
influenced, but for others
s u c h as caffeine it is not.
T h e research has been
able to s h o w that the rate-
determining step for the
brewing process involves
diffusion of caffeine
through the bean or leaf
c o u p l e d with diffusion of
water into the solid. In the
future Dr Spiro hopes to
use a computer simulation
study to gain a better
understanding of this
process.
In 1982 this work was
featured as part of a
T o m o r r o w ' s World
programme, but as the date
was April 1 many viewers
believed it to be a hoax. It
was however quite genuine!

for this research obviously
feel that this type of
objective characterisation,
when c o m p a r e d to the use
of tea tasting panels, is
important for their future
developments. They hope
that the production of a
quality instant tea for
vending machines or
transport catering will be
made possible.
In the food a n d drinks
industry ginger extracts art
used to flavour a number c
products including ginger
beer and ginger cake. At
present simple traditional
extraction methods are
used to prepare a soluble
ginger extract from ginger
root. Dr Spiro in
conjunction with a large
firm is currently making a
system study of possible
new solvents, a n d the
optimal conditions of time
and temperature required
to p r o d u c e the ginger
extract. O n e of the solvents
to be studied is
supercritical c a r b o n
dioxide. It is already used
to produce decaffeinated
coffee, a n d is popular with
medical authorities w h o are
c o n c e r n e d about traces of
solvents that are at present
found in s o m e foods.
Dr Spiro's work is
providing information
which is of use to the food
and drinks industry in the
short term. In the long term
this work c o u l d well have
wider applications in the
extraction of soluble
substances s u c h as
medicinal drugs, dyes or
foodstuffs, from all kinds of
biological materials.
