Rectors Talk At Party
Lord Flowers talks to Professor Ash, his successor as IC
Rector, during the Guilds Cocktail Party on 11th
December. The first ever student party in 170 Queensgate
proved to be a great success according to Guilds
President Roger Preece. The Union invited academic staff,
MP's and leading industrialists to meet students and hear
about the College at the end of its centenary year. The
anniversary has been used to raise the profile of the
college in industry and to develop stronger links with the
City and Guilds Institute, Prof Ash and College Secretary
John Smith have indicated their approval of the event
which may now be run annually.

Pissed
A sizeable contingent from

a large police presence.
Nevertheless a large
(although smaller than
previous years') c r o w d
indulged in the usual g o o d
spirited merry making a n d
the police adopted a 'softly
softly' approach. A l t h o u g h
alcohol w a s banned from
Trafalgar Square, there was
still considerable evidence
of drinking, not least
a m o n g IC students.
A number of people were
admitted to hospital, mainly

at least two of the IC
contingent, alcohol
poisoning. Both IC

collection for the appeal.
