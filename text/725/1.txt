AUT OUT
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) and the
National Association of Local
Government Officers (NALGO)
will be holding a day of action
on January 15 which will take
the form of a national strike.
The AUT, which will be striking
for the first time in its history, is
dissatisfied with the inadequate
funding of Higher Education: its
action is intended to express
the strength of its members'
feelings on this issue. N A L G O
members are striking in support
of their flat rate £14 per week
pay claim and against the 5.2%
which they have been offered.
The A U T is calling on all
members ballotted to withdraw
their labour, and therefore not
take lectures next W e d n e s d a y .
Pickets will be on duty, but will
be instructed not to try to
obstruct entry to the C o l l e g e .
Rather, they will try to persuade
non-striking colleagues of the
justice of their cause. S o as not
to be disruptive, the A U T has
also informed the C o l l e g e of the
strike, allowing them to re-
arrange interview s c h e d u l e s .
The Government has plans to
cut the budget for universities
by 2%pa over the next five
years. Professor Frank
Leppington, President of
I C A U T , has said that s u c h a cut
w o u l d have serious
c o n s e q u e n c e s for Higher
Education as the universities
c o u l d not maintain the quality
of education without increasing,
or at least static, university
funding. This, he said, was
indicative of the way the
present Government
undervalued education. He
hoped that next week's strike
might persuade Tory ministers
to ease financial restrictions.
I C U President Carl B u r g e s s
has expressed his support for
the A U T ' s c a m p a i g n . In a
motion to be put to T u e s d a y ' s
I C U G M , he will ask students to
support the strike by not
attending C o l l e g e on
Wednesday. He feels that in an
issue which will directly affect
the education of future
students, I C U has a duty to
support the teachers action.
N A L G O , which has members
in the libraries, in Student
Services, and in Sherfield, is
demonstrating against a pay
offer which is 1.7% below the
rate of inflation and 2.3% less
than the rise in average
earnings. N A L G O members w h o
are e m p l o y e d by universities
earn considerably less than
their counterparts working for
private industry or in the civil
service. This is due to the
limited amount of money w h i c h
the universities can afford to set
aside for their secretarial a n d
administrative staffs. A m e m b e r
of IC N A L G O suggested that
the C o l l e g e ' s high staff turnover
was due to low pay levels.
E m p l o y e e s leave to higher
paying jobs after an unusually
short time, forcing C o l l e g e to
find and train new staff who
need time to learn their jobs.
Unless they were paid a wage
w h i c h was in line with the work
that was being done, a static,
experienced staff c o u l d not be
expected.
The strike will have limited
support from the other two
Prof Leppington
main c a m p u s unions, A S T M S
and N U P E . A S T M S has agreed
not to cross picket lines or to
work with any A U T or N A L G O
section, while N U P E will be
working to rule on W e d n e s d a y .
Is That All?
Student Grants are to be
increased by only two per cent
(a £42 increase on the L o n d o n
grant of £2165) for the
a c a d e m i c year 1986/7.
Education Secretary, Sir Keith
J o s e p h a n n o u n c e d the c h a n g e s
in the H o u s e of C o m m o n s on
D e c e m b e r 16. T h e G o v e r n m e n t
is also preparing to withdraw
certain benefits w h i c h are
currently available to students,
although they may increase
grants by an additional £36 to
c o m p e n s a t e students for the
lose of benefits. Students will
not be able to claim any
unemployment or
supplementary benefit during
the short vacations. In addition,
students who live in halls of
residence will be banned from
claiming housing benefit during
term-time. T h e Government is
also intending to curb claims
from students living in private
flats from next J u n e .
IC Welfare Adviser Lesley
G i l l i n g h a m is particularly
c o n c e r n e d that students living
in the C o l l e g e ' s head tenancies
may not be entitled to h o u s i n g
benefit. It is not clear whether
these residences w o u i d be
classed as halls under the
p r o p o s e d regulations. If
housing benefit is withdrawn,
the flats in L e x h a m G a r d e n s , in
particular, will b e c o m e too
expensive for most students.
The plans to reduce the
benefits payable to students
were outlined in a D H S S press
statement earlier this week.
S o m e of the proposals are
covered in the government's
white paper on social security.
The D H S S has also brought out
a consultative d o c u m e n t which
deals with the projected
c h a n g e s in housing benefit.
Wednesday's G u a r d i a n reported
that the Government intends to
make it illegal for students to
claim any benefit on flats or
houses which they are not
o c c u p y i n g .
F E L I X contacted the
Department of E d u c a t i o n and
S c i e n c e on W e d n e s d a y and
s p o k e to Press Officer, R i c h a r d
Duckenfield. He said that the
c h a n g e s will save a r o u n d 45%
of the money spent on having
benefits paid to students.
