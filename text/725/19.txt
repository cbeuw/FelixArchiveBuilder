Policy
T h e false prophets of the
60s have gravely d a m a g e d
the British Education
system. T h e R o b b i n s
Principle, w h i c h o p e n e d the
way for every 18 year old
middle class oik to loaf
around for three years at
Uni had the unfortunate
side effect of allowing the
entry of a 'few m e m b e r s of
the working class on the
g r o u n d s of so-called
'ability'.
T h e Conservative
G o v e r n m e n t is pushing
ahead with massive reforms
w h i c h for the first time will
allow the working class a
c h o i c e they've never had
before; they can either
starve to death or join the
army. T h e U K system of
student support is easily
the most generous in the
u n k n o w n universe, as the
table shows.

T h e current 'cuts' are in

w h i c h are in fact paid for
out of Sir Keith J o s e p h ' s
O W N P O C K E T . It just

bloody Williams do this?
Did she hell. A n d do
students thank him for
this? Do they hell. What a

Universities aren't

graduates industry needs.
REVIEWS
Pretension
W h e n I go to see a film, I
want to see o n e with lots of
blood, sex and hamsters
being blown up with
dynamite. T h e trouble is
that if I wrote about h o w
the 50p peep s h o w d o w n
W a r d o u r Street is I'd look
really untrendy.
S o I went to see Peter
G r e e n a w a y ' s A Pee and
Two Ones. T h i s film must
be really g o o d , b e c a u s e I
didn't k n o w what the hell
was going on half the time.
C o m p l e x i t y and
pretentiousness are the two
major influences in c i n e m a
these days; this film has
both, with most moving
s c e n e being w h e n N a t a s h a
Kinski banged a kipper
against wall while reciting
passages from Salinger's
'Catcher In T h e Rye'. It was
a sympathetic treatment
that truly s u m m e d up the
h u m a n condition. However
the best acting
performance w a s given by
B a r o n von Ostwald's truss,
and thoroughly deserved
the O s c a r for Best
S u p p o r t i n g R6le.
In complete contrast,
Emanuelle and the Zombie
Flesheaters from Mars was
the other film I saw this
week. Actually I quite
enjoyed this one, especially
the cleverly crafted s u b -
plot where a b l o o d - c r a z e d
z o m b i e rips N o r m a n
Tebbitt's arms off in a
protest against the high
unemployment rate
amongst cadavers,
s c r e a m i n g : " T h a n k s to y o u ,
we can only get bit parts in
c h e a p o B-movies like this."
But a film with a title like
that can't be any g o o d , and
it wasn't directed by Peter
G r e e n a w a y either, so I'm
g o i n g to slag it off
something rotten.
Music
N o w available from local
record s h o p s and the
F E E L S I C K Office are
copies of Dave J o n e s ' new
a l b u m , cassette, c o m p a c t
disc and video, 'Out Of T h e
S h a d o w s ' . Dave, next year's
F E L I X Editor is paying for
his 76th farewell tour with
the m o n e y saved by using
his election publicity as the
album cover
No c o u r s e at IC includes
options on 'Ordering
people around', 'Wearing a
suit', 'Funny handshakes' or
' H o w to land c u s h y defence
contracts'. What these
wimps, c o m m i e s a n d
queers in the Universities
don't realise is that in a few
years time w h e n nutters
like me take control we're
g o i n g to shut them d o w n ,
burn the books, d e m o l i s h
the buildings, replace them
with fields and use them for
fox-hunting. T h e n we're
g o i n g to invade France,
stop w o m e n from voting,
shoot all the trade
unionists, sterilise the
working classes (who
s p e n d all their time
breeding instead of
working at the cotton
mills), froth, froth, gibber,
bloody pinko suversives,
froth, Maragaret Thatcher
is g o d , froth, gibber, C e c i l
Parkinson, gibber, SDI,
gibber, gibber...

T h e Dep Pres is very lazy
and was beaten in the U L U
elections. T h e President gets
drunk frequently.
Quentin is 148 years old,
and didn't vote for Dave
Kingston at U L U .
Dave Kingston wanted to
be A c t i n g President last

C a n you tell from this
h o w many thousands of

Kingston is going to sulk.
Win! Win! Win!
W a c k y Dep Pres, Dave
Kingston had forgotten to
