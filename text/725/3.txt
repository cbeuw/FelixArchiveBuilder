Dear Editor,
This term there has been
m u c h speculation
c o n c e r n i n g the future of
several U n i o n rooms,
including the L o u n g e and
the B o t - Z o o C o m m o n
R o o m . W e w o u l d like to put
the record straight in
a c c o r d a n c e with
information given to us by
Professor A n d e r s o n .
The B o t - Z o o C o m m o n
R o o m has been allocated
to the Department on
account of requirements for
s p a c e c o n n e c t e d with new
research contracts and
grants. T h e research s p a c e
is to be used to create a
new m o l e c u l a r / i m m u n o l o g y
infectious disease unit to
work on problems of
parasitic disease in
developing countries. T h e
room k n o w n as the L o u n g e
was to be allocated to the
Department to be divided
into a s e m i n a r / c o m m o n
room and a lecture theatre.
This now s e e m s unlikely
but room(s) in the U n i o n
Building area are still under
consideration for use for
the B i o l o g y Department by
the C o l l e g e .
A s members of the
Department and of the
U n i o n we feel that any
U n i o n room will be more
used by students if part of
it b e c o m e s a new. B o t - Z o o
C o m m o n R o o m than if it
remains in its present use.
We apologise to those w h o
work hard on the L o u n g e
being the only party room
in C o l l e g e . However, m u c h
space in the U n i o n is
wasted, especially on the
first floor. T h e B o t - Z o o is
fairly unique in C o l l e g e ,
being a c o m m o n room
used by many staff and
students, as well as people
from around Beit Q u a d ,
and is essential to the
undergraduate,
postgraduate and staff
c o m m u n i t y of the
Department. T h e queues in
the B o t - Z o o twice a day
testify to this.
Mr Burgess's present
arguments are simply
serving to delay a decision
and mitigate against the
undergraduates and
postgraduates in the
Department and C o l l e g e by
c a u s i n g a break in service
when the B o t - Z o o closes in
M a r c h .
It seems unrealistic for
M r B u r g e s s to c o n s i d e r that
the Department will allow a
room in w h i c h it intends to
invest cash, in order to
create a civilised c o m m o n
room and lecture theatre,
to be run by the U n i o n in
view of the general state of
U n i o n rooms. T h e C o l l e g e
can in the end act without
U n i o n agreement. W e
w o u l d therefore suggest
that the best interest of the
greatest proportion of
students would be served
by a s p e e d y agreement to
c o n c e d e s o m e use of the
U n i o n as s o o n as possible,
if not the L o u n g e . T h e
interests of students are
also not being served by Mr
Burgess misleading them
by stating that they c a n
prevent C o l l e g e doing
anything in the U n i o n
Building.

Job Withdrawal
Dear Sir,
In view of the recent
a n n o u n c e m e n t that our
Glenrothes facility is to be
closed early in 1986, it
follows that we will be
withdrawing from next
year's graduate recruitment
programme.
Please arrange to bring
this to the attention of
potential candidates by
whatever means is
appropriate and withdraw
our literature. Where
undergraduates have
already applied to us, I will
reply to them directly.
Yours faithfully,
For GENERAL

Dear FELIX,
I used to think your mag
was the best, but now I'm
not so sure, we don't all
want those boring beefcake
types. Lay off that cute
hairy guy, or I'm going to
start reading Broadsheet
for my photo-loves.

Hamlet Havoc
Dear Sir,
I am a resident in a single
room in a flat in Hamlet
G a r d e n s . Recently, I
received a further rent bill
for £75 in addition to the
o n e I paid at the beginning
of term. O n a p p r o a c h i n g
the Students Services
Office. I was told that this
is due to my not being
charged for the C h r i s t m a s
vacation in my first bill.
Yesterday, I also receivced
yet another bill, for £145,
which, I am told, is for the
C h r i s t m a s vacation rent,
plus an extra £5 a week
w h i c h the Student S e r v i c e s
Finance Department
neglected to charge me, as
they billed everybody for
living in a d o u b l e room,
instead of finding out the
true facts. H a d they done
so, they w o u l d have
realised that seventeen
people in Hamlet G a r d e n s
are living in single rooms.
Alternatively, if it was
necessary to obtain the
rent money as s o o n as
possible after the start of
term, why c o u l d they not
explain the situation in a
covering letter with the first
bill? T h e n we c o u l d have
budgeted for this extra
rent.
O n informing student
services that I c o u l d not
pay this bill until after
C h r i s t m a s I was told that
my total bill in the first
week of next term w o u l d be
£595 ie £450 for rent until
the end of the Easter term
and £145 as outlined above.
This w o u l d leave me
approximately £120 with
w h i c h to survive the s e c o n d
term; it w o u l d have to cover
purchase of tube pass
payment of gas and
electricity bills, together
with essentials like food
etc.
Whilst I do not object to
paying the extra when I c a n
afford it, I do object to the
general lack of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n , and , it
appears interest by the
Student S e r v i c e s F i n a n c e
Assistant. I ask student
services to ensure that
errors s u c h as these cannot
o c c u r again and, also that
we are informed as to the
true situation s h o u l d this
farce be repeated.
Yours faithfully
