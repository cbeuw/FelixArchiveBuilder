Thought for the Day
Diary of a harassed Felix contributor-, in the wrong place at the wrong time
Sunday 27 September
late afternoon
I've just made my way into the office to
submit a column and an album review to
add to the news piece and freshers'
guide I've already written. Eddie is flash-
ing his new logo and layout designs
around on trial pages featuring non-
sense Underworld lyrics, and strange
philosophical theories based around
teapots. The pages look rather fetching.
We've got until tomorrow lunchtime to
finish the middle four sheets. I agree to
stay and do a bit of layout.

early evening
It's taken a good couple of hours of
messing about to get a one-page fresh-
ers' feature printed. The computers are
being insubordinate again. The kettle
goes on. We smile for a short period. I
notice the time. We abort the cup of tea
and start on the columns. I couldn't pos-
sibly leave yet. There's too much to do.

night
Thought for the Day and Voice of Reason
are on the paste-up sheets. There's two
pages of maps and codes for the fresh-
ers' fair left to do, plus some adverts, and
a cover page. Myself, Eddie and ex-edi-
tor Jeremy head back to Ed's house to fix
the dodgy maps Neil O'Shaughnessy has
given us.

Monday 28 September
small hours
No sleep yet. Eddie finds that one of the
disks with a map on is corrupted. I take
the disk out and scientifically hit it a few
times against the desk. The disk works.
Vital time is recovered. A large sigh of
relief contributes to global warming.

8 a.m.
Both of us are, as Wilfred Owen put it,
"...drunk with fatigue." The laborious cre-
ation of several hundred text boxes to
make the maps readable is complete.
The freshers' fair guide is on the paste-
up sheets. Eddie fiddles with the careers
feature and the adverts. I'm very tired,
but we're definitely getting there.

10 a.m.
Two plates are supposed to be at the
printers'. We prat about, writing on ran-
dom objects and arranging them in the
scanner to make a tasteful cover for the
freshers' guide. Precious seconds tick
away. Finally the cover page is finished
and pasted up. It was done in half an
hour, and sadly shows it. Eddie disap-
pears to the printer. I go home and go
to bed.

Tuesday 29 September
lunchtime
I drag myself out of bed and back into
the office. We've had some sleep, but
now have an even bigger task ahead -
the remaining twenty-four pages. I get on
the 'phone to Matt Hyde, ULU President,
and begin writing the front-page story
about the new LT Students' card. I ask
him why ULU is so useless. It's fun. I like
this job.
late afternoon
The front-page is half full. We're satisfied
with the story. I start on the caving fea-
ture, proof-reading; sub-editing; layout.
It's not as easy as it looks.
Felix 34 Fate
early evening
Mark Baker and Jason are in the office.
The music and games pages are begun.
I finish the caving feature. The end is in
sight.
Felix 4-4 Fate
ten to midnight
Music and Games are finished. I've done
the back page. Eddie is pasting up
adverts. Just news to go, with a few
hours until the print deadline. We're shat-
tered and hallucinating, but we're gonna
make it.
Felix 54 Fate
midnight
Security arrive and announce a four-hour
power cut, effective immediately. Eddie
faints. We begin dismantling the server
to take the hard disk home, but are scup-
pered by the incompatibility of NTFS. We
give up, go back to Ed's, and write news
for four hours, while muttering darkly
under our breath.

Wednesday 30 September
6 a.m.
Ed is struggling through his first editorial.
I am laying out news and sport; scanning
adverts; touching up the music and arts
sections,- writing bylines; tweaking pic-
tures and proofing articles. We're not
going to finish. It's going to be late. The
printer jams.
Felix 5-6 Fate
Eddie has taken five plates to the print-
ers'. We've missed the print deadline on
our first issue. I go to bed and sleep for
many days.
Friday 2 October
morning
Felix hits the streets. It's all over, and out
on time. We've beaten Fate. The process
of rebuilding our tattered lives begins...

A long long time ago, In a hospital far far away ....
Welcome back to the new and improved
Imperial College of Medicine and other
vaguely related subjects. Yes I've tem-
porarily been promoted from writing
insulting letters to writing insulting arti-
cles. To some of you who have been kind
enough to say that you were amused by
my previous offerings this may be a good
thing and for those of you who were not
amused, tough, but do keep up the
threatening letters.
A special welcome to all of you out
their who have struggled through the
emotional minefield of UCAS and have
finally won the right to be little fish in a
big pond again by becoming freshers.
We have all been there before and from
the fragments that I remember and the
libellous stories that have been spread
about me I had a great time.
There is, of course, a particularly spe-
cial group of freshers, those deemed
worthy of a place reading medicine. Pro-
vided that you don't do too much read-
ing you'll enjoy yourselves. Imperial
doesn't really know what you are like just
yet and if you don't tell them then I
promise that I won't either. As far as the
bringing together (I have gone off the
word merger) of the two most Illustrious
of the London medical schools' goes, its
gone, and quite successfully. Over the
last week CX went to SMI I and vice versa
and since no one can remember details
of what happened on any of these mixed
occasions I have to assume that every-
thing went very well.
Moving on to other matters the new
improved ICSTM boasts a working
(almost) Alexander Fleming building. Do
not worry that you won't all be able to fit
in the lecture theatre because once you
are in the sound is a bit dodgy, so you
probably won't hear anything anyway
and unless you sit at the back you can-
not see anything. An addition to the out-
rageously technology heavy theatre is the
seats. After a few false starts working out
how to sit on them you'll find that com-
fortable though they certainly are if you
try to rest on the desk in front to have
forty winks to try and overcome the pre-
vious night's excess, you can't. Cunning
design or Irritating design flaw, I will
leave you to decide after you have taken
them for a test drive.
Finally, to prove that I have not totally
mellowed over the summer, I will say a
few words on my favourite subject. In the
best traditions of Imperial College, after
exhaustive efforts to find a competent
union team they have promptly thrown
them all out. I have sympathy for those
who have had to alter their career plans
and wish them well in wherever they
have headed off to. Their departure does
mean that there will be elections this
term and because certain members of
the IC team are gluttons for punishment
they have brought up the sticky subject
of block voting. I never truly understood
what the fuss was when non-medics out
numbered the medics by about ten to
one. Possibly the embarrassing humilia-
tion of being wound around the little fin-
gers of St Mary's quite so easily upset
one or two of the more vocal members
of the College. Who knows? The point is
that elections are coming up and to the
new year I can only say join in rather than
sit on the side lines and complain
because frankly that just gets boring after
a while.
