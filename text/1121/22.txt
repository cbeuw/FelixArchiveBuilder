Rugby Trials
This year the Imperial College Rugby Tri-
als began on a somewhat lower note
than usual, when the transport to I lar-
lingtron failed to turn up. Instead, Hyde
Park became the venue, but this did not
detract from the standard of play. Our
coach, Pete Joyce, was not fazed by the
change and quickly got to work in get-
ting things together and going through
some simple drills. Trial games then
began, with an .array of skills being
shown by both freshers and some of the
more senior players. The attitude of all
concerned was commendable, and
some of the older lads who did not turn
out could maybe learn a thing or two
from today. Retreating to Southside for
post-match in-depth dissection of the
day's happenings, we had a great deal
of fun in socialising with our new found
team mates. We now look forward to
Monday, at 6pm, when we have our
first training session. Our first game in
BUSA is on Wednesday at 12.30pm. All
are welcome for training, so we look
forward to seeing you there, or come
down on Wednesday to try out for a
third/fourth team game to improve your
skills and make your way up to bigger
and better things.

Dear Auntie Anna...
I've just moved to university, but it's
full of scientists. I desperately need
an outlet for my creative urges.
Maybe I could do something in TV?
Anon, IC
