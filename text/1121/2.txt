Linstead Carpet Nicked Elections
by All Campbell
Parents moving freshers into
rooms in Linstead I lall might
have been rather shocked
on Saturday, as the hall's
upper gallery was missing
one carpet.
The old carpet was
removed on Friday 2 Octo-
ber, and was supposed to
have been replaced on the
same day. For some reason,
this job was never finished,
leaving only a bare; floor to
greet impressionable new
students.
The mystery became deeper when
rumours sprang up of the carpet having
been stolen. Richard Hamilton, assistant
warden of Linstead, con-
firmed these suspicions,
stating that the staff were
"absolutely gutted", lie
added, "If anyone knows
where our carpet is, could
they please let us have it
back".
The roll of carpet was
standing outside the hall,
presumably on Friday,
whence it was apparently
purloined. Linstead staff

~ were forced to distribute
written apologies to all freshers, which
were supplied to them along with their
keys.
The carpet has since been replaced.
Nomination papers go up today for
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies), as
well as for various Council positions.
Anyone thinking of standing for the
position of DP(CSS) should talk to the
current sabbaticals to find out what the
job entails.

Tuesday brought the Freshers' Fair
and, although the sky blackened as the
afternoon dragged on, the rain held
back all the time stalls were up. In the
evening the comedy night was well
attended, with Sean Lock getting at least
one laugh from everybody in the room.
Although he seemed somewhat taken
aback being surrounded by scientists, he
rapidly got Into his swing and realised the
best strategy was to take the piss out of
Imperial students (something which, lets
face It, Imperial students are expert in
