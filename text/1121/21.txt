Do you have problems dealing with your
own life? Do you find washing yourself,
doing the laundry or paying your rent on
time a complete pain. Well this 'game'
isn't for you. If instead you have a hor-
rendous craving to look after something
that has some of the irritations of a pet
but can't get you arrested for continuous
cruel torturing then read on. Right hav-
ing got rid of most of you I'll continue.
Essentially this is a bigger version of
creatures, the virtual pet program. You
still have to hatch out the eggs into little
furry little bundles of fun, teach them to
speak, eat and be inquisitive. Then when
you've got enough you can watch them
breed (well not in any detail) and develop
a new generation of hopefully slightly
more interesting and intelligent fur balls.
I laving no paternal instincts at all I
left my charges to eat and wander about
the world as they pleased and this prob-
ably explains why none of them survived
into adulthood. Fred and Alice died of
starvation on a little island. Bob drowned
and poor Vic just wandered off and by
the time I got back from a toilet break
was found face down pushing up the
daises. But should you want to care for
them you can teach them using a sim-
ple computer, you can then force them
to go and eat the food generated by the
little ecosystem. You can also open up
your medical bag and treat them for var-
ious diseases, check their health and
mess about with their fertility. All good
fun for those potential parents and Nazi
doctors keen on starting your own mas-
ter race of furry creatures.
If you have an internet connection
you can even force others to see the
family photos of your little friends and
swap eggs to prevent your creatures
from becoming the furry equivalent of
inbred hillbillies. All good clean fun but
only slightly more interesting than watch-
ing grass grow, and that's the problem.
You have the choice of stopping and
watching every character, which
becomes tedious in the extreme, or you
walk away and come back to find them
dead. So in summary it's one for those
who like interactive screensavers, have
heart conditions and can not allow them-
selves to get too excited, or those who
like torturing small creatures but the
RSPCA prevent them from keeping any-
thing that breathes. Not so much as a
game but a way to waste time slowly.
Quakeadelica
Dennis Fong, aka Thresh, is the US cham-
pion of the PC game Quake II and, at the
tender age of 21, he is sponsored to the
tune of $100,000 and drives around in a
Ferrari, just for playing on his computer.
Quakeadelica, a virtual fight to the
death hosted by Wireplay, is being held
at the Ministry of Sound, London, on 15
October. Hosted by Dani Behr, the event
will see eight of Britain's finest PC gamers
challenge Thresh for his Quake crown.
The eight finalists were determined
through three regional heats held at
Cyberia Internet cafes in Edinburgh, Man-
chester and London during the last week
of September and five online heats. The
prize for the overall winner of the
regional heats was an all expenses paid
trip to New York to play in the AMD PGL
(Professional Gamers League) final.
An estimated 50,000 people in
Britain do battle against each other as
individuals or as 'clans' through the Wire-
play games network, although how
many of them are current or ex-IC stu-
dents remains unknown.
