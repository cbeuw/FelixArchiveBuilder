After carefully examining all the entries (It didn't take long), we decided that this
was the only witty one. Congratulations to Nick Newton from Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School for saving us much embarrassment.
This week's photo was also taken at the Summer Ball, and also
features former ICU President Andy Heeps, this time accompa-
nied by then Publications Board Chair Mark Baker. Apart from
Andy's obvious admiration for Mark's sunglasses, what might
the lovely pair be thinking?
The best entry
(in the opinion
of the editor etc
etc) will receive
a free copy of
