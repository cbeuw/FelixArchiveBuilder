W
e started off this
tour in Britain,
which is a good
place to start
– personally I
would have been worried to wake
up in any other country but the one
I’d fallen asleep in, especially given
today’s geopolitical wrangling. As a
collective, the whole of Sinfonietta
had decided that Britain was simply
too cold, and that we desperately
needed cheaper alcohol than that
on offer in Britain, owing to the fact
that most of the orchestra had spent
their student loans by the time tour
came round. So anyway, that is how I
found myself at Gatwick airport one
Thursday afternoon in June, Thurs-
day 28th June 2007 to be precise.
The flight was uneventful, and we
all landed safely to a quite a tem-
perate climate. The advanced party
(consisting of the supposedly more
wise among the Sinfonietta great
and good) had organised a bus for us
from the airport to our accommoda-
tion for the week: the Villa Rasica.
We oohed all the way there – the
architecture of outer Dubrovnik is
very Mediterranean (as one choir
member informed me – he should,
know he has lived in Italy for a bit).
We arrived quite late, but naturally
went to the nearest bar as fast as
possible and happily sampled £1 per
half litre of beer for as long as we could.
This turned out not to be very long as
the entire orchestra exhausted the ca-
pacity of this small watering hole and
soon all the draft beer was gone, later
followed by bottled beer. It’s not that
any member of the orchestra has culti-
vated a particular ability to drink alco-
hol; it’s just that there were an awful lot
of us. At around two we all drifted off
to bed, as the dream of cheap alcohol
was shattered, much like most of the
musicians.
The next day we had a tour of Du-
brovnik. Here some people may say
“nothing can ever possibly prepare you
for the architecture of Dubrovnik” and
other such hackneyed phrases, as if the
buildings were going to attack you –
and that you need specialised training
in architectural defence. This may in-
volve many hours of studied reading of
art and design history, civil engineer-
ing; and wandering urban spaces with
explosives to protect yourself, possibly
a bit of both. To be honest, if there ever
was a city to be unprepared for, Du-
brovnik is probably it. From the marble
polished paving stones that you walk
round the city on, to the white gold
granite that most of the city’s architec-
ture is constructed from, Dubrovnik
really is the gem of the Adriatic.
The rest of the day was given over to
exploring Dubrovnik ourselves (read:
going to the beach), and then back to
the Villa Rasica for dinner. Then more
beach. Some of us had serious musical
commitments that evening – Impe-
rial College Choir had their first re-
hearsal with the unique Collin Durant.
This was a big moment for the choir,
them being tour virgins. Yes! This was
Choir’s first tour in their 50 year his-
tory. Apparently next year they want
to go to Wales… But anyway, after
literally dragging most of the choir
members from the beach, the villa’s re-
ception was soon filled with the deep
throaty sounds of the choir. The boom-
ing tenor sound of Ed Hughes was par-
ticularly prevalent (the very same man
who later won the tour award for being
the loudest member of tour).
That evening, Big Band played their
first concert in the main square of
Dubrovnik, just in front of the church
of St Blaise. This was a chance for
much merriment, with a combination
of dancing and loud music, many of
the other musicians being enthusias-
tic dancers. Afterwards we went to a
bar on the old port and admired the
view. More importantly this was the
night where our dear Chair Hilary
Wood displayed her amazing driving
skills. The side entrance to the walled
city was made of arches in the classi-
cal Venetian style, and we had rented
a Luton van (complete with tail lift) to
transport instruments from the UK
to Dubrovnik and around Dubrovnik
itself. The problem did not present
itself until Hil successfully negotiated
the van through the first two arches (a
job which required millimetre preci-
sion, due to the respective dimensions
of the van and the arches). It was only
the next arch which proved impos-
sible to negotiate the van through.
Mostly because the archway was far
too small and the van was far too
big*. Then Hilary tried to reverse the
van back out the way she came. Only
when she started this endeavour did
she realise that the level of precision
required that the wing mirrors had to
be closed off. Also, Luton vans don’t
have rear view mirrors. To cut a long
story short, it was a long and arduous
ten minutes whilst Hilary reversed the
van (seemingly by telepathy), and then
Music to
the ears of
Dubrovnik
Sinfonietta,
Big Band and
Choir Tour
took to town of
Dubrovnik for
their summer
tour. Tom Kealy
reports
“If there was
ever a city to
be unprepared
for, Dubrovnik is
probably it.”
