The DOs and DON’Ts
Chiraush Patel
Mr. Muscle
Sports league
For most of you now, it’s been one
week into the year, and though the al-
cohol will have put pay to any memory
of the week, you can look in the mir-
ror and the story will tell itself. Mus-
cle? Lacking. Definition? Hardly. Need
some advice? Get to the gym.
But before you grab your belly tight
Nike Pros and run off to do some
bench press, ask yourself do you really
know what you’re doing? You could
end up embarrassing yourself like an
inexperienced lover taken to bed for
the first time. Or at the very least your
misplaced machismo may rub some
seasoned vets the wrong way. If you’ve
never been to a gym before (the toilet
where you do your heavy lifting doesn’t
count), then this simple guide is for
you.
DO plan your gym session ahead of
arriving to the gym. You don’t want to
look like a pansy as you figure out what
exercise to do next. Have a plan, which
muscles, which exercises, how many
sets, how many reps. If you need a
hand there are always sample sessions
on this page.
DON’T get a big ego. Whether
you’re a newbie or a professional, you
can always learn something new from
anybody. I’m always looking for new
exercises, new training techniques to
maximise my efforts in the gym, and so
should you. Just because your muscles
are getting bigger doesn’t mean your
head has to also.
DO keep hydrated. 2% drop in water
is a 20% reduction in performance. You
do the maths. You may have to go to
the little boys room a little more but its
worth it’s worth it in the long run.
DON’T bring your entourage. Sure a
training partner or two is a man’s best
friend, but if you and your whole crew
come to the gym, no work is going to
be done! Save the socialising for the
library.
DO ask for help. Being around some
of the biggest guys in Imperial (a rare
species indeed) may leave you in awe,
but don’t be afraid to ask for help if you
don’t know what your doing. Big guys
have big hearts and we all love to help
the new breed, just don’t drool over the
biceps.
DON’T show lift. By this I mean lift
weights that you can’t do a single rep
of, just to look cool. Other than injur-
ing yourself and occupying weights out
of your league, you’re going to look like
a prick.
DO push yourself. In fact always
push yourself; if you don’t then there
are plenty of museums around campus
to occupy your time.
DON’T think the gym is your house:
clean up your mess. Don’t just toss
weights to the side like a cheap hooker
when you’re done with them. Pack that
shit up!
DO enjoy the experience, without it
your not going to want come back any-
time soon.
They are not the biggest muscles in
your body, nor are they the most pow-
erful. The size of these bad boys may
not even give you an advantage in you
daily activities. But the biceps will,
and always will be a showpiece mus-
cle. A statement, as if to say, “Don’t
worry guys, I’m fully loaded”. So come
summer time, if you want to rock the
sleeveless vest and open up your own
gun show, you may want to build up
your artillery now.
This session will give your biceps
the most intense work out, leaving
them feeling burned out, weak, used
and abused. But embrace the feeling
because with proper nutrition they
will grow back, and boy will they grow
back. Now you can ditch the peashoot-
ers and pick up the twin Uzis.
The preacher curls are essential for
a good work out for the long head of
the bicep muscle. Using dumbbells,
rest your arm on a bench and curl the
weight stretching the muscle as far as
it can go, as in the picture. Use your
other arm to give it a slight spot if you
need it.
The ‘finisher’ for biceps is rope curls.
Using the rope attachment to the ca-
ble machine set the cable to the lowest
setting and curl the rope. Remember
to keep good form- a straight back,
knees slightly bent, elbows back and
your biceps doing all the work. Start at
a weight which you can curl for 8 reps,
then lower the weight setting and start
again, then again, and again. Do it until
you can’t physically move those arms.
Then say hello to your little friends.
Felix takes no responsibility if you
break yourself in half whilst trying
to lift weights that are clearly too
heavy for you. Man up!

This year, Felix Sport is going to run a
league table for all the sports team at
Imperial. It will hopefully encourage
a bit of friendly rivalry between the
teams and the clubs, and at the end
of the year, an overall champion will
be declared. Below is the league table
where all of the teams competing in
BUSA competitions are included, so
if you want your scores to be counted,
please make sure you send you results
in to BUSA.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) - (L*3).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year. Good luck!
The league will start properly next
week, once the first set of BUSA league
games are played. Also check out the
result and fixtures section below .

So you’ve seen the Ethos gym and have
decided to turn yourself into an Adonis
or Aphrodite like figure then? Or per-
haps you just want to trim down those
bingo wings or fill out your shirt sleeves
a bit more? Well hopefully you’ll have
got an introduction at Ethos giving you
an idea of what to actually do in the
gym, but what do you do afterwards?
That may sound like a dumb question
as the answer is obviously work/ Halo
3/ pub/ etc…
But that is not the answer. At least
it is not if you want to get the best re-
sults from your hard work. So what is?
Well pay attention know as I am about
to let you in on what is the single most
powerful toning, muscle building and
fat loss tool there is…the Post Workout
Meal (PWM).
When you lift weights you are dam-
aging your muscle tissue. That’s right,
you’re damaging your muscle in the
gym. You build your muscle when
you’re outside the gym. When you fin-
ish your workout your muscles will be
crying out for raw materials to repair
themselves and get stronger. The PWM
is meant to give your muscles all the
materials needed to rebuild your mus-
cle as fast and as strong as possible.
So what should and should not be in
the meal? The first thing is protein, as
it is protein that will provide the build-
ing blocks for new muscle tissue. The
next ingredient is carbohydrates as this
will provide the fuel to power the mus-
cle repair process. The PWM should
not contain fat of any kind as fat will
slow down the absorption of the pro-
tein and carbohydrates. I’m certainly
not saying fats are bad as you’re body
needs them, and some fats can be very
good for you. But fats just do not have
a place in a PWM.
I my opinion the best form of PWM
would be a protein shake made with
whey protein and any sugary drink e.g.
Coke, orange juice, etc… (Sorry, beer
and snakebites don’t count). That’s
right, it is not only ok to have proc-
essed sugary drinks after a workout, it
is actually a very good idea. The sugar
will get straight into you’re blood and
up your blood sugar levels. This will
cause a release of insulin which will
drive nutrients (i.e. sugar and protein)
into your muscle cells. Don’t worry,
this is probably the one time of any day
that eating sugar will not make you put
on fat. The best protein to consume is
powdered whey protein (mixed with
water into a shake) as this type of pro-
tein will be rapidly absorbed into your
bloodstream and will start the recov-
ery process of your muscles ASAP.
What’s that you say? You don’t want
to spend your beer money on expen-
sive protein shakes? Well, fortunately
for you cheapskates Nature (in con-
junction with your local supermarket)
has provided you with a cheap substi-
tute that is actually pretty damned ef-
fective: Skimmed Milk. It has simple
easy to absorb proteins in it (the whey
protein in those expensive shakes are
extracted from milk) along with some
sugar in a pretty good protein:carb
ratio for building muscle. But you’ll
need to drink 750ml or more of it (you
should aim to get 25grams of protein
or more in your PWM).
But why would you eat after a work-
out if you’re trying to lose weight?
There are two main reasons. Firstly,
it’ll encourage your body to build more
muscle. Building muscle requires a
huge amount of calories and your body
will use your fat stores to meet some
of that energy requirement. With car-
diovascular exercise (e.g. running)
you stop burning extra calories when
you stop the exercise. When you stop
weight lifting you keep burning extra
calories for days as your body rebuilds
your muscles. Secondly, if you work
out hard your body will typically start
to release cortisol after 40 minutes
or so. Cortisol (sometimes called the
‘stress hormone’) encourages the con-
tinued break down of muscle tissue for
energy and the storage of fat in your
fat cells. The PWM will shut down the
release of cortisol (good) and promote
the production of testosterone by your
body (also good).
So work hard in the gym, but don’t
sell yourself short by missing out on a
PWM. It will become one of the most
important tools in your fitness toolkit.
