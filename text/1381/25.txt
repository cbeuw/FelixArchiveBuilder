America’s Next Top Model
The latest series has begun!
I love how girls in this pro-
gramme still think it’s anything
other than an entertainment
programme. It’s worth watch-
ing despite Tyra’s annoying
face.
Watches
The next generation won’t
know what watches are!
Mobile phones have killed the
watch. Buy a retro casio style
watch from Urban Outfitters
(£48) while you still can. Soon
people will be baffled and con-
fused by the antiquated tech-
nology of the wrist watch and
you will be openly mocked on
the street.
Stables Market
Redevelopment
Good! I want a shopping
centre! I want the corporations
to take over! The people who
oppose this have the rose-tint-
ed view of a Camden they fell
in love with when they were
14. It’s just the same t-shirts
on every stall.

Body mod for the ungodly
Although tattoos only became wide-
spread in popular culture in the 90s,
it was actually only a slight resurgence
over the course of history. People have
been scarring pretty patterns into their
skin since ancient times. Roman em-
peror Caesar wrote that, ‘All Briton’s
stain their skins with woad’, and Herod
of Antioch was apparently amazed to
find that ‘Britons wear animals “in-
cised” into their bodies’.
The word tattoo comes from the
sound the tattooing instru-
ment makes on the skin
of those being tat-
tooed and derives
from the Poly-
nesian word ‘ta’
which means to strike
something. Polynesia
is often credited as the
culture with the most
important influence
on the art of tattoo-
ing. However, in ancient
times, tattoing was also
widespread throughout the
rest of the world.
There is evidence of tattooing
even in the Bronze Age (3500 -
1100BC) in the mummified body
of ötzi. ötzi, the five thousand year
old ice man, was discovered
on a mountain between aus-
tria & italy, his frozen body
preserving his 57 tattoos.
A cross on the inside of
the left knee, six straight
lines 15 centimeters
long above the kidneys
and parallel lines on his
ankles.
In Celtic culture sym-
bolic tattoos were very
popular. The most com-
mon tattoo designs were
of spirals, and knotwork.
The complex braids of
knotwork tattoos sym-
bolised the connection of all
life. Step or key celtic designs
symbolised the various paths
of life’s journey.
In Russia, mummies found
dating from around 2400
years
ago, are tattooed with a variety of ani-
mals. Some, like griffins and various
monsters are believed to have a magi-
cal significance, others are decorative,
and some are to signify status.
Japanese people were mostly inter-
ested in the decorative aspect of tat-
toos. The horis (japanese tattoo artists)
were innovators in the use of colours,
perpective and design.
Some tattoos were restricted by gen-
der. In Egypt, female mum-
mies have been
found with
tattoos of
abstract geo-
metric pat-
terns made
up of lines
and dots,
an art
form
restricted to women only.
However this rich tradition of tattoo-
ing was almost destroyed in the West
by the Church. A passage in the Old
Testament, Leviticus 19:28, states “You
shall not make any gashes in your flesh
for the dead or tattoo any marks upon
you.” And so tattooing became banned
by church edict.
Previously tattoos were used as sta-
tus symbols of importance and power
within religious communities, even in
early Christian society.
For centuries afterwards tattoos were
stigmitised as uncivilised. Pagan tribes
that were converted to Christianity had
their cultural traditions such as body
modification forbidden by their new
religion. Tattoos were still widespread
in many societies not touched by
Christianity, such as tribal
and warrior societies,
and by people on its
outskirts of society, such
as pirates and robbers.
In the 18th cen-
tury explorers
returning from
their travels
exhibited
tattooed polynesians to the public, to
demonstrate how “primitive” their so-
ciety was.
However the return of captain Cook
from Polynesia created a resurgance in
the popularity of tattoos with sailors.
By the end of the 18th century most
British ports had at least one profes-
sional tattoo artist. And so began the
reintroduction of tattoos into western
culture.
In 1862, the Prince of Wales had a
jerusalem cross tattooed onto his arm,
which was emulated by the aristocracy.
Echoed in the way tattoos took off with
the general population after it becom-
ing popular with celebrities in the late
20th century.
Like many things
banned by reli-
gion, as new
generations
grow up
and re-
ject the
doctrine
of their
parents,
pointless
taboos are
shaken off.
Tattooing is
heretostay,chang-
ing it’s form according
to the whims of
fashion.
COOL
Tattoos have always been around, to rebel or conform, for decoration or elevation
