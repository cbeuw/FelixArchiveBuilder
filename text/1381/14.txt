A starter’s guide to BookCrossing
Free books, but with a scavenger-hunt twist. Michael Cook has what you need to know to get started
D
ear Reader”, the blurb
begins. “I hope you enjoy
this book. I’ve registered
it on Bookcrossing.org
so that I can keep track
of where it travels and what people
thought of it. You can log in online and
leave your thoughts, before passing it
on to another reader.” And that’s about
it.
Underneath,inhertrademarkspidery
handwriting, is the book’s registration
code. It’s Bookcrossing, summed up
simply, in its best and cleverest con-
cepts. Free books. Sharing. Travel.
We read a lot of crap. There are a few
reasons for this. Firstly, crap is cheap.
Crap is 45p on a newsagent shelf, or a
£3.99 paperback sandwiched between
memoirs of page three girls and Z-List
rugby players, and containing some-
thing bizarre about a loveless ex-po-
liceman on the run to clear his name
or something.
Reading crap is also fun, though – JK
Rowling was hardly TS Eliot, but her
writing was fun enough for people of
all ages to read. But sometimes, we
have to avoid rubbish and go for some-
thing meatier. Something more enjoy-
able. Not boring, necessarily, or three
inches thick. But good.
Fortunately, this isn’t too hard – for
instance, you pick up Felix and flick
How to Fossilise Your Hamster
Mick O’Hare
Brand new companion to the other
New Scientist bestsellers Does Any-
thing Eat Wasps and Why Don’t Pen-
guin’s Feet Freeze, this book contains a
huge assortment of experiments that
can be carried out with virtually noth-
ing. Check out our coverage of the
book this issue.

The Ladies of Grace Adieu
Susanna Clarke
A collection of curious short stories
containing, amongst other things,
Mary Queen of Scots, faeries, and very
strange owls. Grace Adieu is an enter-
taining collection of fairy-tale-esque
stories that, whilst sometimes over-se-
rious, are otherwise very enjoyable.
Travelling – Tuesday 9th October
Old Shite’s Almanac
A. Parody
Parody’s work always seems to be try-
ing too hard, but the Almanac’s a pret-
ty fun diversion – a tongue-in-cheek
collection of topical, not-so-topical,
and essentially useless information
about the year just gone. Sometimes
very funny, sometimes not, but always
amusingly surreal.
Travelling – Wednesday 10th October
Crossing now
immediately to the Arts section,
where you absorb their well-
respected opinion on the
latest releases of the high
society, and nod sagely at
the words of their attrac-
tive and well-endowed
editors.
There are two things at play here,
that the founders of BookCrossing
noticed. Firstly, that people will read
almost anything if it’s free. Secondly,
that sharing our opinion about books
is great fun, for both the writer and the
reader. After all, we’re not doing Felix
for the paycheck.
So what if people just left books lying
around for others to find? Giving books
away for free is friendly, stops dusty
piles of paper building up in the cor-
ner, and adds a bit of excitement into
the day for those that find them. Book-
Crossing only marginally extended the
idea of giving books away, by adding in
a secret ingredient. A massive game of
hide-and-seek.
It’s very simple – you sign up to
BookCrossing.org and subscribe to
whatever regions you’re near to. Ken-
sington, for instance, is going to be eas-
ier for you to visit and pick up books
in than somewhere in Oregon. Then,
BookCrossing tells you when a book is
going to be released in that area.
If you find the book (hints are left
on the website to help you), you read
it, review it on the site, and pick an-
other place to leave it in – which in
turn notified everyone else subscrib-
ing to the area you’re leaving it in. The
books slowly travel the city, country or
globe, picking up opinions as they go
and often creating stories about their
journey.
And if you find yourself with books
you no longer want to hold onto, it’s
Coming soon
The Mission Song
John Le Carré
One of Carré’s latest novels, it has all
the intensity that you’d expect from the
ex-Mi6 agent-turned-author. Bruno
Salvador is a world-class interpreter
that’s no stranger to doing clandes-
tine work for the British Government.
But his latest assignment goes beyond
what he is normally used to – identity
changes, shady corporate deals, and
mysterious encounters with attractive
nurses. Meaty, but good – for fans of
The Constant Gardener.
GOD – Man’s Loving Enemy
Adam Bolton
Felix Arts was given this by one of
our Comment writers, but we’ve been
told not to spoil the surprise of what
it might be, so instead we’ve got a joke
for you. A bear walks into a bar, and
goes up to the barman. “I’d like a Gin.”
The barman begins to pour it, but the
bear holds up a claw, and he stops.
“And tonic.”
“Why the big pause?” the Barman says,
and the bear shrugs, and replies, “I was
born that way.”
It’s the way I tell ‘em.
Delete This At Your Peril
Bob Servant
A great compilation of email corre-
spondence to Internet spammers. Gen-
uinely funny, and hopefully all true,
Felix Arts will hopefully review this in
the near future.
very simple to start a journey your-
self. Simply register the book with the
site and they’ll give you a unique code
and a little message to leave on the in-
side front cover (which we’ve printed
above). Tell them where you’re going
to leave the book, and when you’re
roughly going to put it there, and just
follow the timing.
More often than not, the books are
taken but not registered. Because
they’re more likely to be found by non-
Bookcrossers, the idea of registering
can be quite daunting, and doesn’t im-
mediately appeal to the average reader.
But sometimes you’ll be lucky, and
start off an entire chain of reviews as
a book travels from person to person
and country to country.
Take the friend who’s given me my
latest BookCrossing book, for instance.
Her profile has one particular book
that made nine journeys before coming
to a rest. She gave it to a colleague in
the bookshop where she works – from
her, to her sister. To her boyfriend. To
someone he met in France. To another
friend – and each one of these left their
messages on the same web page, letting
others see where the book’s been on its
travels.
Not everything is so successful. A
month ago, I left six books in a cafe.
They were all gone within a week, but
arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Arts
none of them were registered on the
website. But the messaging is just the
icing on the philanthropic cake – free
books were given, reading was done
and a good time was had.
Now, Felix gets a lot of books. We re-
view some, put others in features, and
many we give away. This year, though,
we’re going to BookCross them. They’ll
be left at various places on campus or
nearby landmarks (the Albert Me-
morial, or the museums for instance,
which are popular with other local
BookCrossers) and they’ll all be regis-
tered on BookCrossing.org. That’s free
books, most of which are freshly pub-
lished, ready to be picked up by willing
readers!
We’ll post our releases in Felix as we
decide on them, but to get up-to-the-
minute information on the releases
you’ll need to sign up with the site. To
see what we’re putting into the wild
this week, and what we’re planning to
give away soon, check out the box on
the right.
BookCrossing has a thriving com-
munity that share book reviews and
stories of Crossing success, and while
the alerts system isn’t always entirely
accurate (we’ve had a lot of alerts that
were three weeks late), there are a lot
of releases in the Kensington area,
ranging from classic fiction to cook-
books. It’s a novel way to experience
new books, recycle old ones, and have
yourself some very childish sort of fun
whilst doing it.
If you’re BookCrossing in this area,
get in touch with us and keep us in-
formed about your releases – if we can,
we’ll put them the paper alongside our
own. If you’re not BookCrossing, get
started now. We’ll be giving away a lot
this year, and it’s the only way to get
your hands on it!
