Games
I remember when this was all 2D
Michael Cook battles non-linearity, World of Warcraft and old age to keep his love of gaming young
I
’m getting old. Not properly old,
but I’m two decades into my in-
nings here, and I’ve been playing
games in one way or another
nigh on fifteen years now. It’s
scary, when I think of it, even though
my usage at that age amounted to sit-
ting and watching my Dad beat up an
old Sinclair ZX Spectrum. I don’t re-
member much of what we played. But
what I do remember, quite vividly, was
the Amiga 600. I remember Zool. I re-
member Dizzy. I remember the EGG-
SONLEGS password that made him
fly.
Times change, though, and I’m fine
with that, really. Dizzy was good fun,
but I don’t feel my brother has missed
out, raised as he was on a healthy diet
of Ratchet and Clank. In fact, for all the
new technology and fears of commer-
cialism that plague gaming nowadays,
it hasn’t changed all that much in the
time I’ve been playing. Governments
rose and fell, we solved Fermat’s Last
Equation, but other than the Internet
taking multiplayer gaming up a notch,
little has changed.
Look at Doom’s release, all those
years ago. Despite connection prob-
lems, we downloaded and played it
across the world. Soon after, we played
Command and Conquer for the first
time, and dabbled in Ultima Online – a
whole world with monsters, cities, and
real people!
Now, despite having massive game
worlds and complex goals, the big-
gest hit of the moment is Valve’s Team
Fortress 2 – which, despite connec-
tion problems, we’ve downloaded and
played across the world, with the basic
formula of kill or be killed unchanged.
And what else are we playing? Com-
mand and Conquer 3, and World of
Warcraft – a game in which you live
in a whole world with monsters, cities
and real people!
Don’t take this as an attack on origi-
nality today – I think it’s great that
gaming is fundamentally unchanged.
It shows that we knew what fun was
before we discovered complex phys-
ics engines and antiscopic filtering.
That my children will enjoy roughly
the same experiences I did, even if they
can actually tell what they’re playing
(which definitely wasn’t the case with
the ZX Spectrum), is actually quite
heartening.
Instead, the similiarity of today’s
gaming world to yesterday’s worries
me that I may just be getting old. Half-
Life 2 feels empty now, as I re-play it in
anticipation of Episode 2. Quake Wars
feels bloated and overcomplicated.
World of Warcraft seems like a gigan-
tic waste of time.
So why do I get excited at the thought
of a Deus Ex re-run? Why was I so de-
termined to find a copy of the original
Broken Sword? Why am I still involved
in a painstaking play-by-email game of
Alpha Centauri? If gaming is a fresh
and new as it’s always been, then how
come I’m not having as much fun as I
used to? Why don’t I think the plots are
as good any more, and why am I sud-
denly wondering if WASD wasn’t such
a great invention after all?
Maybe it’s the first signs that age is
setting in, or that I should hook out the
Amiga emulators and hunt out some
ROMs for The New Zealand Story, or
attempt Superfrog again and actually
finish the damn thing this time.
And maybe, maybe that’s not such
a crime after all. I grew up with these
games, the comfort of two dimensions
and the pitter-patter of a 56k modem
gurgling its way through a phone line.
It’s right. It’s beautiful. It’s time for the
torch to be passed to the mewling thir-
teen year-old Counterstrike players
of today, so that they can become the
whisky-sipping Civilisation IV play-
ers of tomorrow. And they, in turn,
will have their own fond memories
of when screens were only 21-inch,
and you could still buy games in high
street shops, and the Master Chief
hadn’t been put in a spin-off kart rac-
ing series.
And where will that leave me? Some-
where quiet, hopefully, with an 800mhz
Pentium, a copy of Unreal Tournament
and Team Deathmatch on Morpheus.
Those whippersnappers, I’ll say, don’t
know the meaning of multiplayer.
Why, I remember, back in the day,
my Dad would wrestle with a ZX Spec-
trum and a cassette player, and I’d be
glad if…
Now on Channel 4 it’s time for Retro-Loco – When Nostalgia Attacks IV
Can you spot the difference between the two games? If not, you are probably me, or in need of serious medical help. Or both
Zool
Did you play Zool? Trick question, of
course – everyone played Zool. If you
didn’t play Zool, you wouldn’t be read-
ing a Games section right? Just in case
you didn’t, here’s what you missed out
on – other than my love – Zool was
a platformer for, among other things,
the Amiga. Featuring the titular ninja,
from the Nth dimension, Zool was a
cookie-cutter platformer when cookie-
cutters were still in style.
He jumped, he kicked, he fired weird
orange amoeba from his hands. The
bosses were leaping alarm clocks and
giant clown faces. It was sponsored
by Chupa Chup lollies for Christ’s
sake – it was everything that was great
about that time in gaming, and reason
enough for any of you to hook out an
Amiga emulator and track down some
ROMs.
Superfrog
Similar to Zool, Superfrog was a cheery
cartoon platformer that hit all the right
targets to become a classic on the
Amiga and Amstrad. You’re a frog. But
you have superpowers! You even have a
cape, for chrissakes. If you thought Fi-
nal Fantasy VII was missing something,
it’s probably a frog in a cape. But that’s
where Superfrog knocks Squaresoft
out of the park, you see? Amateur
mistake, guys.
You leapt, you soared, you col-
lected fruit. It was the life not
just of a frog, but a great frog. A
super-frog, if you will. Supes is
stillplayabletoday,thanks
to a very smooth con-
trol system, and really
crisp graphics. Anoth-
er one that’s well worth
emulating, particularly
with the decline
of really good
platforming
on the
PC.
Bill’s Tomato Game
Now, apparently, we’re not allowed
to use puzzles unless they describe
themselves as involving a ‘physics en-
gine’, whatever the hell that means.
Bill’s Tomator Game involved gravity,
but they managed to avoid using the
dreaded phrase by focusing on things
that were actually fun, such as the fact
you got to bound and splat the red fruit
on trampolines, jack-in-the-boxes
and through myriad obstacles.
The plot was gripping –
you were tasked with rescu-
ing your tomato-y girlfriend
from the clutches of an evil
squirrel, but the only
way to get to his
tree-top lair was
to propel yourself
through eighty lev-
els of crazy pump-
kins, toy soldiers,
wrecking balls and
pyramids.
None of this ‘A
hero never dies’
crap. That’s a real
story, right there.
Monkey Island
Monkey Island is a series that’s still be-
ing matured by LucasArts, but judging
by their handling of the latest Sam and
Max outing, the originals may turn out
to be their finest hour.
You’re Guybrush Threepwood, a
mightypirate,andnotonlycanyouhold
your breath for ten minutes, but you’re
going to learn even more
useful skills in your quest
to become the mightiest
pirate in the Caribbean.
Sword-fighting that’s
based on exchanging in-
sults? Check. Zombie pi-
rate with a wisecracking
skeletal crew? Check. The
second biggest monkey head
you’ve ever seen? Check.
Monkey Island still has
some of the best writing seen
in gaming, and even less nos-
talgic gamers still revisit
it year on year. Go
find it for the PC,
but expect to
wrestle XP to
run it.
Pong
Now this is a proper bloody game.
None of this graphics engine crap, or
advanced fuzzy AI, or massive mul-
tiplayer, whatever that means. Why
would I want to play games with re-
ally tall people? They play the same as
short people.
Anyway, Pong was proper solid.
There was up, down, sometimes up
and then down really quickly. Fakies,
I called it. Plus the ball – that was
some difficult shit. Was it go-
ing to bounce at the angle you
expected? Could you get to
the other side of the screen in
time? That was real tension.
Then they tried to update it
by making it 3D and adding
in a Britney Spears license,
and collectable weapons
and downloadable skins for
the bats, but they’re just
selling out, man. Give me
a pen and paper any day.
Any-
one
for
chess?
