Council in session three years ago in the Union Dining Hall (UDH). The first meeting of 2007-08 is taking
place in the UDH on Monday 9 October. Nominations are open now, get your bums on those seats!
Council nominations are now open
On Saturday 29th September the nom-
inations for positions on the Coun-
cil committee and the Trustee Board
opened. There are 16 positions open
on Council and another two places on
the Trustee Board. Undergraduates
and postgraduates are both eligible to
stand for election between now and
Sunday 14th October when nomina-
tions for both committees close.
Council is a well-established and
long running committee that meets
every month to discuss and vote on
Union policies. Anyone can turn up
to the meetings and voice their views.
Policies can be offered up for discus-
sion at Council by any Full Member of
the Union. That means you, me and
everyone else. Students at Imperial are
automatically Full Members. You can
opt out of this membership if you re-
ally don’t like the Union, for whatever
reason you can come up with.
Council’s philosophy is that any stu-
dent can raise any point that they deem
necessary for the Union to discuss.
Formally, the process of discussion is
brought about by submitting a written
report to the Union during the week
before the actual Council session. This
gives the other members who’ll be at-
tending a chance to read the report in
preparation for discussion and dissec-
tion come the day of the meeting.
Most of the major changes in the
Union from previous years were dis-
cussed at Council. For instance, it was
decided by a vote at Council last year
that a referendum for NUS (National
Union of Students) affiliation should
be held. The vote was passed and the
subsequent referendum saw Imperial
rejoin the NUS. Other reports tabled
and passed last year included an en-
vironmental policy that ensures the
Union does its bit to help curb Climate
Change and a couple of comedy poli-
cies such as the ‘Mike the Micrometer’
policy which banned students from
stealing the Union mascot.
Council meetings will take place in
the Union Dining Hall every month this
year, the first of which will take place
on Monday 8th October. The commit-
tee is chaired by Mark Mearing-Smith.
He is joined by various Officers of the
Union, such as the Faculty Union Pres-
idents and the chairs of the many sub-
committees within the Union.
However, there are many positions
available to regular students. The
nominations for these positions are
now open, so if you want to stand for

process of appointing students from
each Faculty Union. Undergraduate
and postgraduate positions need to
be filled by Sunday 14th October, oth-
erwise the Union may find itself in a
rather embarrassing situation and have
to re-run the election.
If you decide that you want to run for
election, you’ll need to get four of your
friends to “second” you. In other words,
they need to go online and give you a

he Union (regular students)

vote of approval to say that you’re fit to
take up the position. Once you’re past
this stage and through the other side of
the nominations phase, you’ll have to
come up with a manifesto to tell people
why you’re fit for the role. Once you’ve
done this, you’ll have to make a short
speech at hustings and after this you’ll
be questioned by a bunch of hacks.
Once this is finished voting will open
on Friday 26th October. It closes on
Tuesday 30th October and as long as
everything goes well, you’ll be awarded
with Council membership.
A similar process is in place for those
wanting to get a position on the Trus-
tee Board. The Trustee Board is the
highest body in the Union and it has
the final say on any decisions. It’s in-
tended to be less of a discussion forum
compared to Council but if you’re feel-
ing bold enough to have a say in some
potentially highly important decisions,
this is the committee for you. to sit on.
There are two positions for any Full
Members of the Union to stand for.
