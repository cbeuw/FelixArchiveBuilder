Imperial College holds
national Kendo competition
Daniel Wagner
On Saturday the 22nd September
Ethos’s sports hall echoed with the
sounds of screams and bamboo swords
smashing into armour. What sounded
like an ancient battle and caused curi-
ous (or fearful?) looks from Ethos staff
and passers-by was actually a national
sports event. It was a competition in
kendo, the Japanese martial art of the
sword. This year’s kyusha taikai - a
competition for kendo players with
less than three years experience - took
place at Imperial College. Organised
by the British Kendo Association this
individuals competition allows junior
rank practitioners to test their skills
against others from across the country
in a set of refereed sparring matches.
The competition consisted of two
preliminary fights, followed by quar-
ter and semi-finals, and the final itself
with judges including Matsumoto-sen-
sei, 7th Dan and coach of the British
Kendo squad.
Approximately 60 competitors from
throughout the country came to take
part in the main competition, another
30 kendo practitioners attended a ref-
eree training seminar before hand and
even more kendo players came to help,
to watch and to join the friendly prac-
ticeafterthecompetition.Toflytheflag
for Imperial our kendo club sent three
competitors: Daniel Wagner, Chris Ar-
gyakis and Tim Simpson, who joined
the club last October and now had to
stand their first solo competition.
Early rounds saw Tim Simpson elim-
inated by a competitor almost double
his age, showing that in kendo age, size
and strength don’t matter - technique
and spirit are the keys. Pushing further
into the competition Chris Argyrakis
overcame Kim Towler of Shyunpukan
before having the misfortune to com-
pete with our own Daniel Wagner.
Besting Chris in a stern fight Daniel
steamed through his opponents from
Cambridge and Edinburgh before be-
ing undone by J. Sitzmann (Nagamit-
su, Birmingham) in the semi-final.
Sitzmann finally won the competition
against S. McDonald. Daniel therefore
achieved a joint 3rd place together with
S. Sykes-Moore.
Overall the competition day was a
great success. Everybody enjoyed the
relaxed atmosphere at Ethos and the
friendly practice afterwards with al-
most sixty people fighting at the same
time was just amazing. Finally - as
usual in the kendo community - many
people went for dinner and drinks to-
gether after crossing swords with each
other.
We now look forward to a new year
of training and to many new students
joining us as the academic year begins.

With no organisation, no plan and little
communication the Imperial Windsurf
Club somehow managed to attend the
annual Animal Windfest in Sandbanks,
Poole. Our travel arrangements may
have been reminiscent of Trains, Planes
and Automobiles (just missing the hu-
mour) but we made it. Greeted by sea,
sand and…perfect sunshine there were
certainly no complaints when we got
there. With BMX and wakeboarding
displays, Zap Cat racing and beach vol-
leyball there was no shortage of things
to see and do...oh and the free beer
van was a bonus. We even managed to
squeeze in some beginner windsurf-
ing lessons by our qualified instruc-
tors in the perfect learning conditions
Saturday presented. All this in baking
sunshine, beautiful scenery and a very
relaxed atmosphere.
As the sun set on a good day our at-
tentions turned to fish and chips and
the legendary Parkway Fish Bar…if
you haven’t been, you’re missing out.
Unfortunately we did miss out on the
Saturday night thanks to some sterling
directions from Niall, but none the less
fish and chips were acquired elsewhere
and still tasted good with a with a glass
of wine at sunset. With the important
matter of food sorted the next activity
on the weekends itinerary was the of-
ficial party, unfortunately our lack of
organisation even hit the part of the
windsurf club that’s usually meticu-
lously planned, the party. Fortunately
we had Hannah to send wheeling and
dealing for a couple of extra after party
tickets. While Hannah bartered for the
highly sought after tickets the rest of
the club were entertained by Nick and
Dom (you know there might be a TV
show in it, but probably not a children’s
one). So why were tickets so hard to
come by? Well taking a few bands,
adding a few thousand outdoor enthu-
siasts and mixing them together in one
big tent you get quite a potent formula,
I think fun was had by all!
Having overlooked transport, food
and party tickets what else could we
have left to the last minute? Well
somewhere to stay would’ve have
come in handy. As the chaos of the
Windfest Party concluded we thought
it was about time to start considering
the issue of accommodation. Although
I missed out on the spectacle I think
the 3 am erection of acquired tents on
a dark beach was quite probably rather
entertaining.
As the sun returned for Sunday it
brought a little wind. Perfect for our
intermediate sailors to get out and re-
fine their skills. The wind continued
to build throughout the afternoon and
eventually gave us enough to run the
UK Freestyle Championships. The
club training trips to Egypt and Greece
last year along with numerous excur-
sions to the coast clearly paid off, as
despite the previous nights exertions,
club member Chris B is now the UK
Amateur Freestyle Champion; an ex-
cellent effort and a well deserved ti-
tle for him. This result is just one of
many highlighting personal and club
achievement in the past year. For a
landlocked university Imperial con-
tinually punches way above its weight
in student competition, finishing 3rd
in the overall Student Windsurf Series
last year.
The IC windsurf club offers a great
opportunity for those of any level keen
to get out on the water. With quali-
fied instructors and club kit we cater
for all levels from beginner to winner
(just add a sense of humour). We of-
fer numerous trips throughout the
year (usually more organised than this
spontaneous weekend). Our adven-
tures range from day trips to the coast
accompanied by our every willing in-
structors, weekend trips to across the
country, Student Windsurf Events in-
cluding the Legendary Aussie Kiss fes-
tival (700 windsurfers, 3 live bands and
a wild wild west country theme, Corn-
wall here we come 24-27th October).
As well as numerous weekend breaks
the club also runs Easter and summer
holidays to sunnier, windier parts of
the world.
