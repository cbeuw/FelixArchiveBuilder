Friday 5 October 2007 felix
Virgo
You continue read-
ing. Looking over
the top of your
paper, you see Allur-
ing Halls Rep. There
aren’t many people
around. You could easily do a quick flash and
no-one would be any wiser. To flaunt what
you’ve got, go to Felix and do a nude shoot. To
use your time machine, go to Leo. To sit tight
and hope for the best, go to Sagittarius.
Scorpio
So... this Horoscope
entry is blank. I
don’t quite know
what to do with
it. Ah yes! Abi!
Well done! Very
well done! The winner of last issue’s JD
competition was Abi Box. Commiserations
to other entrants. To everyone else, sorry the
competition was over so quickly. It was either
that, or not at all. Ciao bennies.
Libra
You find yourself
unexpectedly learn-
ing things. It occurs
to you that there are
a large number of
people in the room
who have never seen your nipples. To expose
yourself, go to Cancer. To relieve yourself, go
to the toilet. To kill yourself, bang your head
on the corner of the nearest lecture hall seat.
Your skull should crack quite quickly.
Sagittarius
You die horribly,
because optimism
never got anyone
anywhere. At your
funeral, they say
that you always
looked on the bright side of life and were a
happy soul, and that that was probably why
Fate dumped on you so often. Then everyone
throws their hats into the air and leaves. The
hats then fall like leaves.
Capricorn
This week, you
pick up a copy of
Felix and turn to
the Horoscopes.
Everyone seems
to be having much
more fun than you. You just can’t follow the
looping structure of the Horoscopes. As your
eyes circle the page, travelling from paragraph
to paragraph, you feel bloated. You swell like a
bosom and explode out of your third naval.
Cancer
You decide to go to
the toilet anyway, as
exposing your nip-
ples to your lecturer
didn’t do you any
good last week, so
it probably won’t now. However, once you get
to the toilet, you find it is occupied by several
part-time rapists, all of whom just happen
to be on duty. You die horribly; a death that
involves soap. Rookie mistake.
Gemini
You pull out the
space katana stowed
in your underwear,
and thrust it into
the Alien King. As
goo drains out of his
spleen, you rise triumphant over his body and
claim yourself king of Planet Euphemism. Go
to page 461. If the issue doesn’t happen to be a
461 page issue, you am fail. Just get out of here
you dirty rat.
Leo
You arrive in a blank
room. The walls are
a blank colour, a sort
of off white colour.
You can’t quite
decide whether it’s
Magnolia or Ivory. It does however look oddly
familiar to you but you can’t quite remember
why so. Shrugging to yourself, you consider
screwing up the space-time continuum again.
Go to Leo.
Taurus
You arrive at lec-
tures to find a fresh
copy of Felix lying
on the floor. It looks
surprisingly clean
although it’s been
on the floor. To begin copulating with it in the
empty lecture hall, place this paper over your
groin area. To read it instead, turn to page 1.
To do something less self-referential, go to
Libra.
Aries
You find yourself
trapped in a small
text box towards the
back of a student
paper. To attempt
to jump out, go to
Pisces. To do something unconnected to this
plotline, go to Gemini. To try and emulate
Hiro’s space-time continuum powers, go to
Leo. If you don’t understand that reference, go
and spaff over Kate from Lost or something.
Pisces
You try to leap out
of the Aries textbox,
but find yourself
being pulled back
down, due to
something shit like
gravity. The bastard. Speaking of gravity, have
you seen that advert with the kid on the tube?
“That’s gravity making his jaw drop.” Clever,
very clever. I certainly appreciated the superb
punnage when I read it. Go to Aries.

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of Wordoku
1,380 was Xing Gao.
Congratulations! The hidden
phrase was “EATMYCHUB”.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Slitherlink 1,381
Aquarius
You open your
latest issue
of Felix to
discover that the
Horoscopes have
been turned into
some bizarre make-your-own-adventure
game. If you continue reading, go to Virgo.
If not, eat some poisoned shrimps and
then disembowel yourself with a copy of
Katie Melua’s latest “album”.
Slitherlink 2 – Normal
Answers for Slitherlink 1
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:
The Slitherlinks on this page are basic
5x5 grids. Get practising because you
can expect some 10x10s later in the
term and perhaps even some severe
25x30 grids when we’re feeling really
mean. Email us to let us know how you
got on with these ones.
In the past, I’ve filled this final para-
graph with something relevant to the
puzzle or answer that’s two columns to
the left. Now I’m going to waffle.
