...so I did
the socially
respectable thing

”
AskMen complains:
“The modern man walks around on
eggshells, afraid of saying the “wrong
thing,
” scared of showing his natural
sexual interest to a woman, scared of
being scorned, humiliated, or even fired
– scared of his own true self”
So, women have made the “effemi-
nate man” when really they want the
“real man”?
I’m afraid where me and AskMen
part, is in our definitions of a “real
man”.
Modern man isn’t something differ-
ent to “a time lost” when man was a
confident sexual being, protecting his
home, his woman and hunting.
He’s as selfish, as testosterone filled,
as emotional (or not) as any other man
from any other decade.
Sure there might be a lot more bad
chat up lines, bad dancing, increased
criticism, a faster paced lifestyle and
an attitude to work over life. Work
over marriage. Work over children.
Work over anything else that exists in
this entire earth... but if you want to see
a real man, go and take a look at the
much overlooked “nice guy”.
But you’ll complain that the “nice
guy” never gets the girl. So I’ll tell you
why:
The “nice guy” seems just too nice to
be ever bothered in the girl.
The “nice guy” never shows the
slightest lusty interest in the girl.
The “nice guy” waits too long and
dithers too much about telling the girl.
The “nice guy” finally plucks up the
courage when the girl has given up and
has gone for the... other guy.
So what’s my definition of a “real
man”?
A man who will treat a girl right. A
man who tries to understand. And he’s
a man who cares and does something
(underlined many times) to show this.
In one word: Action. It’s that simple.
That’s the only difference between the
T
his week has been rela-
tively quiet, in the world
of A. Geek. A few com-
plaints, the occasional lec-
ture, the ever-encroaching
shadow of Boris Johnson’s magnificent
rear end. One thing did get me though.
A friend of mine – we’ll call him E,
because it has nothing to do with his
name whatsoever – asked me to ap-
ply for a bank internship in his name.
Think about that for a bit.
Now, E isn’t the sharpest nail in the
coffin of my sanity, but he’s hardly a
bastion of friendliness and co-opera-
tion either, so I did the socially respect-
able thing and ignored his request reli-
giously until the bastard went away.
Little did I know it was the Money-
bags Conference Fortnight, sponsored
by Two Short Planks, PLC; yes, that
cheery time in the Imperial calendar
where seventy percent of you admit
you couldn’t give a monkey’s toss about
science, and would rather have cloth
sacks with dollar signs on thrown at
you to sit in front of Excel spreadsheets
until the guy above you dies, or you
commit seppuku at the fruitlessness of
it all. My money – and current national
statistics – are on the latter.
Now, as you know, nothing makes
me happier than idiot magnets, as it
not only increases the odds of a gas
leak finally doing some good, but also
allows me to avoid a higher propor-
tion of fuckwits during the week than I
might normally do by simply not going
to the Union.
However, having so many compa-
nies leeching off of a college that is,
for some subjects at least, in the top
ten worldwide, raises some questions
for me. Most prominently, “Are we
completely screwed as a species, if
our brightest minds are going to milk
money out of Hong Kong all day?” But
also secondary, more article-extending
ones, like “What exactly are you look-
ing to compensate for with a fifty thou-
sand pound salary”, or “Are you looking
forward to the 2011 currency crash”,
and my favourite, “Please just leave
my course right now, you shits” which,
while not actually being in the form of
a question, is probably the most press-
ing of all.
I’d say that I didn’t know why you
were doing it, but that – like Goldman
Sachs’ recruitment presentation –
would be largely bullshit. You’re doing
it so you have a comedy-charity-dona-
tion-cheque-sized pay packet to cover
up any shreds of self-respect you may
have showing. That’s fine. We all do
things that are a bit silly because of our
crippling sense of personal failure. For
instance, the other day I realised that
no-one was taking me seriously, so I
decided to run for London Mayor. The
difference here is that, whilst I’ll lose
the vote due to my tricky policy on Un-
derground elevators (if someone is on
the left, and moving slower than you,
you’re legally allowed to throw them
off the side), the long-term effect is just
that I’ve got a failed attempt to enter
politics on my Mi5 file. Whereas you’re
adding yet another five-foot seven col-
lection of genitalia to Canary Wharf’s
already massive pile of schlongs.
And to you, obviously, this means
very little. Because you’re only one
person, you’ve only got one vote, you’re
only driving one car (until Goldman
Sachs recruit you, naturally) and you
can only have one job. Why shouldn’t
you get the best for yourself? That’s
what life’s about, we do live in Amer-
ica, after all! And you’ll probably buy
a wind farm, or adopt a small Ethio-
pian cow, or use energy-efficient paint
on your bedroom door and things like
that, and slowly become right-wing
as you realise the government is tak-
ing most of your hard-earned… well…
earned cash. And that’ll be that.
Or is there something more to that
lecture course you took on immunol-
ogy? Is there some truth in what that
PhD student told you about the impor-
tance of research? Sure, it seems bor-
ing now. And it’s definitely very poorly
paid. Plus, even if you escape Imperial,
you won’t escape the feeling that every
scientific institution has – that unset-
tling air of homework. And probably,
the idea of a moral duty to study rats
in a laboratory somewhere is laugh-
able to you. But while you’re applying
alongside E this week for some faceless
management firm, consider this – if
you don’t go and move green pieces of
paper around, some other jerk will step
in and take your place. But if you don’t
use your intellect to further our under-
standing of the world, no-one will. And
in this day and age, the world could
probably do with being understood a
little better.

An apology
Last week’s Timeline article
stated that patio heaters
would be used in conjunction
with the new Union awning. In
actual fact, patio heaters will
not be used. Felix is sorry is
not getting any milk this week.
