Games Editors – Azfarul Islam and Sebastian Nordgren
Bad Boys
Editors, Heroes
A
nother year for Felix
Games, and a wide-eyed,
callus-fingered fresh new
face will be officiating
the section, right?
You’re oh-so wrong readers, for in
fact there are two!
From the frozen northern wastelands
of Finland comes Sebastian – hardy
warrior and PC fanatic. He doesn’t
believe you’re having a good time un-
less your retinas are being scorched by
explosions and your hands are shaking
from an overdose of adrenaline.
Hailing from the wartorn (hyper-
bole in progress) realm of Bangladesh,
Azfarul is the console aficionado and
all-round nice guy. He’s on the artsy,
hippie side of games and thinks that
engrossing, poignant narratives and
atmospheric design are de rigueur.
Together,welookforwardtopresent-
ing to you the multi-faceted aspects of
the gaming world and hopefully work
up enough courage in you to tell your
friends that you’d rather not go to the
pub tonight since you’re in the middle
of a rather exciting section of BioShock.
But it’s not all sad solo outings because
gaming is a social beast at the best of
times: Halo parties, CS shootouts and
PES tourneys abound; we’re here to
have fun and rock your world!
Or, you know, mildly amuse you at
the very least.
Cheers,
Az & Sebb.

Azfarul Islam thinks that you should join others in huddling around a warm screen
W
hile I’m sure that all
of you have had a
fun time settling in,
makingnewfriends
and generally being
budding little socialites,
it’s time to remember
that you’re at Imperial. So
give in, embrace the geek
within.
A great way to get a
whole common room
or kitchen involved in a
bit of fun is starting up a
round of multiplayer gaming – be it on
consoles or fancy-shmancy PeeCees.
Here are a few classic suggestions to
break the pixelated ice with.
Pro Evolution Soccer (PS2, PC,
Xbox)
Sports are always a great way to invig-
orate yourself creatively, physically and
socially; the game iterations only con-
form to the latter but hey, they’re fun.
The best of the bunch is PES. Why does
it work? Nobody really knows. Perhaps
it’s simply because it does. It’s really a
no-frills entertainment package with
fluid gameplay, organic controls and
a balance that captures the impetuous
nature of the beautiful game. Yeah, so
it hardly has the correct player names
(licensing issues) and maybe the graph-
ics lack pizzazz… but try telling that to
the millions that boycott FIFA.
Counter-
Strike (PC)
A supreme fa-
vourite, par-
ticularly among
the oriental Asian
community, CS is
a realistic game-
mod turned full
title that contin-
ues to offer hours
of entertainment.
The emphasis on team-based tactics
and the mayfly lives of the players
means that battles can springboard
astonishingly quickly between pains-
taking stratagems and all-out carnage.
What truly propels this title is the
abundance of mods lovingly built by
the players themselves. If you’re a nov-
ice, prepare to die... a lot... but have a
great time in doing so.
Super Smash Brothers Melee
(GameCube)
Here’s a title that takes famous (game)
characters, intuitive play mechanics
and a multitude of features and then
creates an all-out fighting experience
that can appeal to anyone regardless of
age or gender. It’s pure and simple fun
solidified into disc form and done so
with tenacity. You can tweak battles to
your heart’s content
and whittle away
the night with ease.
Real-time Pokémon
brawls for the win,
indeed.
Halo
(Xbox,
Xbox
360)
There’s
really nothing about Halo that I haven’t
already said! It’s quite an exhilarating
gameplay experience that succeeds
thanks to fine-tuned controls, addict-
ing map design and by simply being a
blast to play. There’s something about
it that makes the carnage quite gratify-
ing; the balance is pitch perfect, allow-
ing players of most skill levels to enjoy
right from the beginning. Given the
plethora of interesting weapons and
intuitive vehicles, it’s easy to see why
the series offers such a comprehensive
gaming package.
Wii Sports (Wii)
Face it: we all love the Wii! Being able
to channel all that pent up adrenaline
into actual gameplay motion was a bril-
liant stroke in itself and then applying
that synergy into sports games pretty
much seals the deal. Wii
Sports boasts five major
activities: tennis, bowling,
baseball, golf and boxing.
The competition can get
fierce with gamers amaz-
ingly breaking a sweat and
the chances of physical
harm actually exist; it’s a
very intense, addicting ex-
perience that will have you hooked and
you will want to play the next round...
and the next round... and the next one
to settle scores. Nexties? Not a chance.
Gairaigo Episode 1: Okami
Gairaigo is a Japanese loan-word that
conveniently means “loan-word” (see
what I did there?). This section is de-
signed to whet your appetite for the oft
refreshing, truly wondrous and highly
bizarre world of Japanese games. This
goes beyond conventional titles and
looks at a quaint little world where you
illustrate heavenly changes upon the
secular and realise that you’re a forty-
five year old trapped in the body of a
teenager. It’s a mad world, after all.
Okami
Okami is a novel concept that perspica-
ciously attempts to fuel the “games are
art” debate by thrusting a paintbrush
into your hand (or paw) and plead-
ing that you purge the world of evil by
painting a fresh coat of kaleidoscopic
beauty over it. Oh, and you also play
as a Sun deity trapped in the corporeal
form of a white wolf.
I suppose you’re rolling your eyes
with a great deal of askance right
about now, and rightfully so. The con-
cept seems a little too pastoral to offer
a spontaneous gaming experience but
you’re about half-right. The aim of the
game is to really revel in the saturated
hues of the world. You’ll explore stun-
ning locations that are designed with
delicate nuance and face off against
creatures that are so creative and ba-
roque, you can’t decide whether to
attack or admire them. The painting
aspect permeates into every facet of
design and brilliantly at that. You can
pause the screen, summon your godly
canvas and literally stroke slices upon
your foes. Perhaps you’re low on health
and need protection: why not let a for-
est of trees shield you.
When it comes to solving puz-
zles, you’re offered a growing level of
breadth and imagination. Yes, there
is a lot of environmental sentiment
ingrained into the experience but it’s
wrapped in a package that will more
often than not make your jaw drop in
awe. Okami is a long adventure but a
surprisingly tranquil, retrospective one
despite the need for skirmish – if you
need to unwind it can serve as an unu-
sual visual respite.
N for Nynja
In the ongoing pirate-ninja wars, N
is the most compelling argument for
ninja superiority. Forget Johnny Depp’s
charming drunken swagger – N wipes
the floor with him by combining one
of the simplest control schemes of the
past decade with beatifully fluid move-
ment, creating a frenetic mix of action
and classic platformer gameplay. With
a solid physics engine and wonderfully
context-sensitive controls, the game is
the epitome of lo-fi gaming, which will
suck you in and consume your lunch
breaks while you give it “just one more
try”.
