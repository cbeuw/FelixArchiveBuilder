Bread costs rising with global warming
It is wrong to say that extreme weather
events are “caused by” man’s pollution
– as of course, they used to happen any-
way. However, we can certainly say that
the recently observed trend of extreme
weather events increasing in both in-
tensity and frequency is typical of the
predictions made by climate experts.
It’s basically explained by the increased
energy in the system. And it’s pushing
up the price of bread! Yes students eve-
rywhere will have been hit hard by the
news that adverse weather has doubled
the price of a bushel of wheat within a
year and now upped your Sainsbury’s
loaf by five percent. Prices started to
rise last year when the worst drought
in decades devastated crops in Aus-
tralia, then the third-biggest exporter
of the grain. Dry weather has also hurt
wheat plants in Ukraine and Russia,
but it was excessive precipitation that
damaged fields in the U.S. and Europe!
As an ex-investor, I understand
that this is typical of a global theme
which we may well be hearing more
about: that of limited supply stretch-
ing to meet exponentially advancing
demand. As emerging markets boom,
and commodity fund managers specu-
late, the prices of wheat, gold and oil
are all soaring upwards – not pleasing
to economists while US growth seems
to be slowing considerably. What’s re-
ally worrying is that climate change,
over what timescale nobody knows,
could well turn out to be a very seri-
ous stressor in the system, as humanity
attempts to pass through an environ-
mental bottleneck of overpopulation
and wasteful over-consumption.
Nevertheless we Imperial students
will be the ones solving this problem,
so we need to eat! Plus, we need to eat
cheaply, and bread of course remains
one of the cheapest options out there.
So, in the first passionate attempt by
this column to improve the food you
consume, I am throwing out there two
uses for bread which verge on magic.
They demonstrate that creating lovely
food out of cheap ingredients is not
only easy but actually quite satisfying.
A little bit of effort goes a long way,
and that is the magic of cooking: that a
permanent, cost less skill can multiply
pleasure a thousandfold. See below for
the bread ideas.
One criticism of the bread industry
if I had to make one: all those nuts and
seeds – not my thing at all. Their oils
(sesame oil etc.) create a slightly nose-
tickling heady aroma, which I would
prefer to substitute for a malty granary
hit. In fact my life-long favourite bread
has been the Baker’s Oven/Gregs gra-
nary batch loaf. It has a wonderfully
Global warming: one of the hottest talking points there is, but how does it affect the price of your loaf?
mellow malty flavour, and when fresh a
brilliantly soft and doughy consistency
– like memory foam that remembers
your shape when compressed. A bite
of a sandwich with this stuff plugs the
back of your front teeth and the top of
your mouth, like any really fresh bread
should… but then it somehow accepts
a film of mucus and disintegrates in
moist shreds like a steak, rather than
in soggy clumps like a sponge, as your
average white will. But should you get
it sliced in the shop? If you back your
own slicing abilities, this will allow for
flexibility in thickness: you can enjoy
both thick sliced cheese toasties, and
thin sliced morcels with butter and
jam. However, sliced bread is the best
Noel Forrest
thing since before sliced bread for a
reason, in my view – and it’s not lazi-
ness. The truth is that the machine has
surpassed man’s abilities in creating
neat slices. These neat slices are ideal
for sandwiches, where uniformity of
thickness and clean edges ensure a
pleasing experience for the mouth and
the eyes.
Finally, the best thing about bread is
that it’s not meat, which brings us back
to the climate change issue via the re-
cent report in the Lancet. I’m certainly
no vegetarian, but 22% of CO2 emis-
sions worldwide coming from agri-
culture (of which 80% meat) is quite
shocking. Assuming a 40% increase in
global population by 2050 and no ad-
vance in livestock-related greenhouse-
gas reduction practices (can someone
invent a cow-fart igniter, please?), glo-
bal meat consumption would need to
fall to an average of 90g per person per
day just to stabilise emissions from this
sector – equivalent of one hamburger
per person. Yes those high prices ought
to curb demand, but the true cost to the
environment/society is not included in
that price yet.
Sorry to sound like a wartime ration-
ing evangelist, but eating less meat and
more bread, and being smug about do-
ing clever stuff with it all, might just
be fun. But it doesn’t appeal does it?
That’s the tragedy. That’s what we need
a solution to.
If you never do this you are an
idiot and it’s not my fault. Yes
I admit it’s not really a recipe
but in terms of enjoyment
to effort ratio it stands out a
mile – crispy, crunchy, buttery
croutons add so much to your
favourite soup.
1) Saw the crusts off a few
slices of bread
2) Slice the middle bits into
big centimetre-ish squares.
3) Fry until crispy and put
in whatever soup you have
bought or made
NB: I prefer granary bread
fried in butter, but any bread
and anything to fry it in works.
This three-way hybrid of Eng-
lish bread and butter pudding,
French pain perdu and Ital-
ian ravioli is Hugh Fearnley-
Whittingstall’s answer to the
“creeping autumn chill”, and
the seasonal fruit glut we aren’t
exposed to enough in London.

Serves 2:
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon caster sugar,
plus extra for sprinkling
2 tablespoons single or double
cream
3 tablespoons milk
4 thick (1-2cm) slices of fresh
white bread
soft butter
a couple of dozen raspberries
sunflower oil for frying
1) Make a simple raw custard by
lightly beating together the egg,
egg yolk, caster sugar, cream and
milk. Cut the crusts off the bread
and spread a little soft butter in
the middle of each slice (not to the
edges, though, as it may prevent
you making the seal). Pile the rasp-
berries into the centre of 2 slices
(i.e. on top of the butter), squash-
ing them together a bit. Sprinkle a
little caster sugar over them. Take
the remaining 2 slices of bread and
place them, buttered side down,
over the first. Squeeze the edges
of the bread together firmly, mak-
ing a seal all around the edges
- you can use a little of the egg
custard, dabbed on with a finger,
to help it stick. You end up with a
bread ‘cushion’, like a giant raviolo,
in which the raspberries are the
stuffing.
2) Pour the custard mixture into a
shallow dish or deep plate and lay
the bread cushions in it to soak
up the custard. Turn them several
times, until well saturated. Heat
a good centimetre of untainted
fresh oil in a frying pan. When it is
hot enough to turn a test piece of
bread golden in about a minute, lift
the eggy cushions with a spatula
and slide them carefully into the
pan. When the underneath is fried
to a deep golden brown, turn them
over and fry till the other side is
done, too.
3) Drain on kitchen paper, then
transfer quickly to warmed plates.

Dust with a little more caster sug-
ar and serve straight away.
You can fill this lovely pud with
all sorts of seasonal goodies be-
sides raspberries: Bramley ap-
ples, blackberries, plums, pears.
But raspberries will prove hard
to beat.
