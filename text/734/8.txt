Candidates
for the post of PRESIDENT of IC
Union
James O'Shea
proposed by Douglas Earl
In campaigns of this kind, it is
usual for a candidate to
present a long list of beliefs
and promises in his or her
manifesto. These are, usually
largely similar, which is not
suprising as everybody
standing*seriously for
president has the students
best interests at heart. With
such similarity of opinion, the
voter has to decide on a
candidate to support not on
issues but on style and
personality. All presidential
candidiates show evidence of
being egotistical (by standing
for the post in the first place),
which discourages many
people from voting. Do not be
discouraged by the egomania,
which goes with the job, listen
to the various style of the
candidates, and then go out
and vote (for me).
In what way, then, is my
style different? Well, first of
all, I have never been one of
the select group which
dominates ICU council
decisions affecting their lives
being taken, seemingly by
magic, and only revealed
when reported by FELIX. The
union has a structure for
getting information to, and
receiving information from ,
the student body in the form
of the Dep Reps. If properly
used this system has
tremendous potential for
involving more students in the
decision-making processes of
the union, but too many Dep
Reps are lax in their
attendance of meetings and
who can blame them when the
meetings are the trial they are
now. The president should be
kept in closer touch with the
student body, to whom he is
responsible but must make the
effort to contact those Dep
Reps who do not always
contact him. As President, my
main priority would be to
maintain this contact.
Space prevents a more full
exposition of the style of
presidency I would try to
pursue. If you have any
questions please, ask them
any time you see me. Now get
out there and vote.

Chris Stapleton
proposed by Sarab Threadgold
Fight Against Silly Cuts in
Science and Technology
Chris 'Papa Doc' Stapleton
stands for truth, justice, the
National Anthem and little old
ladies on the tube. He pledges
a range of policies designed to
make IC great again, stop us
being pestered by NUS, and
have us totally disowned by
ULU.
Chris, known as 'El
Presidente' to both his friends,
has planned austerity
measures to make student
grants obsolete and replacable
with Government bonds. He
will press for a reduction in
Hall bills for payment in
Krugerands, or by Barclays
cheque. He will reward this
years President, Carl Burgess
with a free repatriation and
p'ans to make the Union Bar
profitable by selling it to
Budweiser.
He plans to 'get tough' with
typical student behavour by
arming IC Security men and
promoting Geoff Reeves to
Gruppenfuhrer.
Remember those who have
had a profound effect on his
life, Chris will award
honourary degrees to
presidents Reagan, Marcos
and Leon Britton.
Students failing their degree
or simply not attending a
lecture will, in future, be
charged with 'wasting
Lecturers time', be found
guilty and promptly shot.
Similar law and order
measures will be applied to
Union Bar staff, feminists and
people who throw up in
Southside.
Remember vote Chris
Stapleton—F.A.S.C.I.ST. We
think it makes sense.

Christine Taig
proposed by Charles Troup
In my time at college I have
come to respect Christine's
enthusiasm and commitment
in her extensive areas of
involvement. As secretary of
IC Ents during its most
successful year and as
Women's Officer (not to
mention posts held in the
Orchestra, Third World First,
and Appropriate Technology),
she has demonstrated
personality and
approachability as well as a
high level of competence.
However, it must be stressed
that she is not a hack in the
sherry-drinking, elitist
sense—she will not shut
rerself away from the views of
itudents, and she does
recognise that a world exists
outside Imperial College and
that the image we present to
that world is vitally;
important.
In short, I firmly believe that
Christine is the right person to
be your president.
Charlie Troup
A manifesto is usually a list of
promises never carried out
MY only promise is to try to
represent all students, not just
union office residents. Specific
assurances are all very well,
but the important thing when
voting for president is the
candidate's attitude.
Accommodation and
welfare, academic affairs and
student's social life are all
serious issues and should be
treated as such by your
representative. For instance,
accomodation will become an
even greater problem next
year as students struggle wifh
their meagre grants and lack
of housing benefits. Imperial.
College MUST aim to provide
more cheap student
accommodation to counteract
the problem-and the president
must take a firm stand on this
issue.
Representing all students
will include publicising my
aci'ons and intentions
reciuKrly in Felix and
WLL OMING feedback; and
conr .Iting those students
directly involved with any
matter.
OK, you've heard it before
now let me prove that I mean
it.
Christine Taig
