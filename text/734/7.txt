Academic Affairs
In FELIX last week, RCS AAO Pete Klemperer
attacked the recent survey organised by ICU
President Carl Burgess and Guilds AAO Luke
Walker. This week Luke replies
I am sure many readers of
FELIX will have read with
some surprise and disbelief
the comments Peter
Klemperer made about the
activities of Carl Burgess
and myself in his opinion
article last Friday. I hope,
by writing this opinion, to
reassure those students
who I have the privilege
and responsiblity to
represent, that what Peter
indicated is a gross
misrepresetation, and to try
to persuade the student
body in general that their
interests are best served by
competent representatives
who work hard to present
an accurate and co-
ordinated view to the
college. I feel that Pete has,
perhaps unwittingly, called
into question the credibility
of student representation in
this college in a manner
which can only be to the
detriment of himself and
the students he tries to
appear to be representing.
He claims that he is
supposed to ensure that
RCS students get fairly
represented, and yet, by his
own admission, fails (very
frequently, I might add) to
attend important meetings.
He was absent from the
meeting of Undergraduate
Studies Committee at
which the membership of
the working groups was
decided, and would not
have been aware of the
most recent meetings of
the group concentrating on
student needs (the group
he is a member of) if I had
not advised him when I (in
the course of doing my job
well) saw him that morning.
I attended the meetings of
this group in addition to my
normal duties, and several
members of the committee
have indicated their respect
for the time and effort I
have put in.
It is because of his
absence at meetings that
he was not aware of what
was going on. The survey
of all academic
representatives was
prepared by Carl and
myself, if he had been
present at the meeting he
would have been able to
make useful comments on
the question on it. He
wasn't, and now is trying to
save face by claiming that
his suggestions were not
considered. If they were
irrelevent to what was
required, is it surprising
that Carl ignored them?
The working group were
grateful to Carl and myself
for circulating the
questionnaire, and it was
Martin Taylor and myself
who spent many hours
processing the replies. I
spent about fourteen hours
one weekend preparing a
report on the questionnaire
replies, because Pete was
basically too idle to show
any interest. The
questionnaire confirmed
certain suspicions of
members of the group, who
then requested us to
release a questionnaire to a
small number of average
sized year groups, to find
out how representative the
ac reps' replies were. Any
year groups would have
done, but we were asked
not to survey more than
about three year groups,
and not to select very large
ones because of the time
factor and the amount of
time it would take. A
questionnaire was divised,
a draft circulated to most of
the members of the group
at the Board of Studies
meeting last Wednesday
(which, you've guessed it,
Peter was absent from) and
a final version of the
questionnaire was then
produced and PETER DID
RECEIVE A C O P Y S O
T H A T HE C O U L D GIVE
ME HIS C O M M E N T S
B E F O R E I PRINTED IT
A N D C I R C U L A T E D IT. His
statement that he was not
consulted is untrue, he
walked into the C & G office
on Thursday
lunchtime—plenty of
people saw him—to discuss
the questionnaire with me
before I made the final
modifications to it on the
wordprocessor and printed
the copies. He goes on to
say that he is reknowed for
'morality'—blatant untruths
in union publications are
not what I call moral!!
The questionnaire was
designed to test a fairly
simple hyposthesis, the
hypothesis is pretty clear
from the questions put,
because that was what was
requested by the working
group. The group was
prepared to rely on the
data as a basis for their
decisions, Pete is accusing
them of gross naivety if he
thinks Carl and I could
mislead them. In fact, it
was them, I stress not with
me pressurising them, who
put forward the hypothesis
in the first place. I happen
to agree with it, because
my experience as C & G
A A O for a year and a half
has indicated this to me.
Pete should not be
surprised that my views
tally with large sectors of
the student population in
C & G , that's what any
normal person would
expect. Also, the idea that
what the problems are is a
set of details is obviously
untrue. That our courses at
IC are theoretical is not a
detail, it is an established
and publicly-known fact of
policy—it is an IC tradition,
we are noted for it.
Lectures being over-full of
material is also not a 'detail'
it is an general problem in
my experience. I am
prepared to accept that
R C S students may feel
differently, that is why we
have a C C U system. I don't
claim to represent
scientists in this college, I
have already told him
several times, as I am sure
has Jane Ryder (last year's
rcsu AAO) that I am rather
parochial in this respect. I
only wish he'd do his job of
representing scientists as
well as I do mine.
The actual layout of the
questionnaire with plus 2s
on the 'discontented' ends
of the scales on the left
hand side was for ease of
processing the results, and
that layout was suggested
to me by Dr Rogers,
chairman of the working
group, and Prof Blow,
Chairman of
Undergraduate Studies
Committee. I am quite
certain that the students
who completed replies
could see how it was laid
out, and were not
'hoodwinked' by a
'contrived' questionnaire, as
Pete tries to argue. How
simple does he think
students are?
It is not true that Chem
Eng 4, Civ Eng 2, and
Maths 2 were used to
represent the whole student
body, while we could have
chosen other year groups, I
selected the C & G ones
t acause I felt they were
fairly typical, I felt the
Chem Eng 4 would be a
group of student who were
near the end of their
course, and would be able
*"i make intelligent
jmment on the
'intergratedness' of their
course. Both year groups
were of reasonable size,
and, most importantly, I
had confidence in the Dep
Reps concerned being able
to circulate the
questionnaires in the very
tight time-scale required.
Peter comments about
the value of IC degrees in
the eyes of employers if
our courses are radically
changed. The findings of
our survey are not being
used to justify a major re-
development of all the
courses in College. He also
makes the obvious error of
saying that there will
always be year groups of
students who make the
particularly comments we
have put forward, and then
says that the problems are
localised and transient.
This college has had its
reputation for many years,
so the problems associated
with highly theoretical
courses are not transient,
and besides we are not
arguing for a shift to highly
practical courses, we are
pointing out some of the
problems which have no
doubt been with us for
years and which are now
what things the U S C is
trying to get sorted out
properly. The U S C is a new
committee, it is looking at
issues which have been
around for years, and this
is the best chance
undergrads have had in
years to ensure that these
problems are addressed
properly and useful action
is taken. Pete tries in his
first paragraph to claim that
we are not doing this, it is
perfectly clear that we A R E .
My position is that of a
sponsored student, and I
am prepared to admit that
my sponsoring company
has been in favour of my
being A A O . I have the
benefit of regular and
frequent contact with
people in industry (a large
number of companies are
represented at one of the
Boards I am on), and the
feeling I have about the
way in which employers
see this college is not just
hearsay, it is based on
personal knowledge of the
situation. If Pete thinks that
it is the course here that
employers think are so
good, I would challenge
this, many emoloyers think,
in my opinion, recognise
the importance of the
abilities of the students
who are attracted here. It is
the people that are at least
as important as what they
know. Readers may think
the distinction between our
views here is slight, but it is
real, and I feel that my view
is rather more reliable and
complete.
