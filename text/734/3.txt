A Figment Of
RCS's Imagination
Dear Ed,
I read with interest your
report of Tom Mel liar-
Smith's resignation,
especially the discovery
that he is not registered at
IC. This certainly leads
credence to my theory that
Tom Melliar-Smith does not
exist.
Consider the evidence:-
in any picture of
hypothetical R C S hack, you
will notice that he has two
arms, each with a forearm,
making a total of ten. Ten
arms is an odd number for
any human being. Ten is
an even number. The only
Tom Melliar-Smith or Sean
Davis
number which is both odd
and even is infinity.
Therefore if Tom Melliar-
Smith exists, he has an
infinite number of arms. As
this is plainly impossible
we have proved that Tom
Melliar-Smith does not
exist, and so it is not
surprising that registry has
no record of him.
We now come to the
worrying question: why
have the pages of FELIX
and Broadsheet been
peppered with references
to the activities of this
mythical character for over
a year? The answer is
simple. RCS, that haven of
ageing, wrinkled, and
degenerate hacks, faced
with increasing
unpopularity and budgets
plummeting every year,
made a last desperate
attempt to gain some
credibility. Their idea was
simple, yet elegant. They
needed a short-haired
fresh-faced youngster,
preferably with a double-
barrelled name, to stand for
Hon Sec. With modern
disguise techniques being
developed at IC for M15, it
was quite easy for even the
moth-eaten Tony Spencer
to take his turn at being
Tom Melliar-Smith for the
day, never mind a selection
of other hacks like Sean
Davis, Sarah Kirk and Hairy
Bob.
Now that the R C S
elections have come
around again, there is no
longer any need to keep up
the pretence.
Only one question
remains. What do they have
in store for us next year?

Is Wrong
Dear Sir,
How easy it is for Penny
Ottway (FELIX 733) to
dismiss talk of the
ratio—and how selfish.
As an academic rep I
have been at many
committee meetings where
males present have
suggested the ratio is
equally unsatisfactory for
their female counterparts,
only to be answered by a
shaking of heads and
grinning from
approximately 1 in 6 of
those present.
There is little doubt that
although the ratio has
some disadvantages for
women, the vast majority
find they have a very active
social life in spite of, or
perhaps because of, the
ratio. So it is just too easy
for Miss Ottway to dismiss
talk of ratio on the grounds
that she does 'not notice
the lack of women' in her
year. She may not, but
what of the majority? The
males.
Thank you Miss Ottway
for rising once again the
question of the ratio in the
pages of FELIX—it has
provoked more discussion
which may eventually lead
to changes for the better.
And for most of the people
at IC that means a more
equal ratio.
Yours sincerely,
Dan Salmons,

Is Right
Dear Hugh,
I could not agree more with
the views expressed in
Penny's letter in last week's
issue of FELIX.
I can understand that the
men at IC are worried by
the lack of females. In fact I
can appreciate that some of
them are downright
desperate, but why is the
only argument ever raised
when disscussing 'The
Ratio' is that it is 'Bad for
the women'. We don't
mind!! A few women exploit
the situation, a few, I
suppose, must dislike it,
but for the most part we
simply do not notice. Or at
least we would not notice if
Men at IC: downright
desperate.
we did not get
questionnaires and
discussions thrown at us
from the minute we walk
through the door.
When discussing
admissions it seems that it
is always 'The Ratio' that is
cited as putting women off.
ThTs is not so. IC has a
slightly higher ratio of
females to males than the
Science departments of
other Universities. I can
only assume from this that
'The Ratio' puts off more
men than women, which
doesn't suprise me!
On positive
discrimination, I think it
should be stressed that no-
one has suggested this
should be used as a means
of getting more women into
IC. What the College is set
on doing is attracting more
than its fair share of the
intelligent women already
going into science. It is
also considering plans of
action to encourage more
females to consider science
at a school level.
Yours sincerely

Correction
Dear Hugh,
Your report on the plan to
rehouse the Holland Club
is accurate in all respects
except one. There is no
plan to incorporate the
space presently used as the
post room, where mail is
delivered and sorted, into
the new Holland Club. The
space available elewhere in
the basement of Sherfield
Building is adequate for the
adaptations planned.
Yours sincerely
John Davidson
