Dear Editor,
1
IC Print Unit is supposed t"<
i provide a service for
students. In a year as
editors of the Chaplaincys
•
• weekly magazine 'Chi-Rho'
• we have tried to make use
' of the service and are very
! impressed with the high
;
standard of workmanship
1
and dedication provided by
Tony the printer.
However over the past
two terms since Hugh
Southey succeeded Dave
Rowe we have been
dissatisfied with the service
provided and have found
Hugh to be unreliable and
totally lacking in his regard
for his customers. We have
repeatedly been promised a
deadline for production of
Chi-Rho by Hugh which is
then not met. As the
magazine is weekly this
means that the material we
have spent many hours
assembling would be out of
date by the time it is
printed.
We realise that for
several weeks FELIX have
had an enourmous amount
of trouble both with the
printing equipment and
with Tony being ill,.
because of this we have not
been surprised in the past
that Chi-Rho could not be
printed in FELIX and have
tried to make alternative
arrangments which on two
occasions involved
• spending more then 20
man hours photocopying it.
What we do object most
strongly to is promises of a
deadline not being met
when the Print Unit is
running smoothly. On
Wednesday 26 at 1.00pm
we discussed the state of
the printer with Hugh and
he agreed to print the
magazine for 6.00pm
Friday. This deadline and
two later ones passed
before the magazine was
eventually printed at
8.00pm Saturday. O n eacl
occasion we brought along
several people to help fold
and collate. At no time
during Friday or Saturday
old Hugh contact us or
even leave a message in
the office explaining the
delay and all
communication was, as
usual, coming out throug.
a third party.
Last week's FELIX
contained a letter
complaining about the
apathetic students of IC. Is
it any wonder we are
apathetic if we have such
incompetent organisations

oh the Sherfield walkway
inviting fellow students to
come and see a film about
Palestine when a student
was spotted removing the
posters just as soon as they
were put up. When
approached by our
president and asked to
explain his action he
retorted 'It is my privilege
to remove these posters'.
This student has since
been identified and a
complaint against him was
lodged with the security
officer Mr Reeves' as well
as the union.
We as a society believe it
disgraceful for a mature
student of Imperial College
to behave in this juvenile
manner. Our policy has
always been to encourage
anyone who is in
disagreement with us,
rather than restort to
actions that can only be
described as deliberate
hooliganism, we hope that
this incident will never be
repeated.
Yours etc...

Dear Sir,
I would like to draw your
attention to an incident
which took place on
Tuesday the 18th of
February.
Members of the Friends
of Palestine Society were
putting up some posters
Engineering
Moans
Dear Sir,
£ o, yet again we see
repeated the old cliches
about science and
engineering being able to
solve all the world's
problems: 'If you are a
thoroughbred Engineer,
you are destined to make
the world a better place'.
(Mark Field, last week's
FELIX). Why then, with our
unprecedented levels of
technical achievement, are
there so many people still
starving? And if, or perhaps
more to the point when, the
nuclear holcaust occurs
then it will prove beyond
doubt that technology is a
bad thing.
On a more everyday
level, our engineering
knowledge has made
possible the construction of
new machines which
deprjye millions of their
jobs and make their lives
purposeless. Those still in
work are alienated by the
vast systems and power
structures that it has been
possible to create, it is no
coincidence that the horror
and violence of modern art
and philosophies like
Existentialism have only
emerged in a technically
advanced culture. Medical
progress may give us
longer lives, but our old
people frequently become
senile or are unable to take
part in society in any
meanful way. Chemicals
invented to make food last
longer or more attractive
have been discovered to
cause cancer or other
problems. Elsewhere,
science and technology
pollutes and destroys the
environment, kills people
and causes other nefarious
effects.
It is certainly not science
and engineering which will
create a better society, as
our civilisation's abysmal
record shows, though
perhaps they may make
interesting careers.

Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
The Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Programme
exists to enable undergraduate
students to participate in
research either in or outside
their own departments. It is
entirely voluntary and is open
to all undergraduate students
The scheme has been goinr
since 1980 and over 200
undergraduates have spent
time in research laboratories
throughout the College as
UROP students. Typical
comments have been '...a
really interesting experience'
'...gave me a chance really to
get to know my supervisor
personally', '...gave me a flying
start with my third year
project', '...made me realise
what research is all about'.
The staff members involved
have been equally enthusiastic
and theJfcurrent Directory
contains offers from 120 staff
spread over all departments.
Since the major U R O P
activity has turned out to be
paid work during the summer,
we have adopted a new
organisation this year. The
member of staff responsible
for vacation training in each
department is acting as the
U R O P agent. He holds copies
of the U R O P Directory and is
available to advise on the
scheme. He will also be aware
of staff looking for U R O P
students in his departmenn
and of any offer additional to
those in the directory. If you
are interested contact him or
else apply direct to Professor
J C Anderson, Electrical
.rngineering, Room 713.
The idea is that you identify
research topics that look
interesting in the directory and
go to see the member of staff
concerned. If you sign up, you
should let either the Vacation
Training Rep. or Prof
Anderson know. If the
research involves a summer
job, the member of staff
concerned is responsible for
finding the funds. Usually, 10
weeks' work would be
expected and the salary is a
matter of negotiation between
you and your supervisor. The
only rule we lay down is that it
should not exceed £70 per
week. (Well, you wouldn't
expect to be paid more than a
postgrad. Would you?) The
great point is that the payment
is a bursary for study during
the vacation and as such does
not have NHI or tax
deducted—you get the lot!
Last summer we had 42 U R O P
students working; this year we
hope to do better.

Training Representatives are
