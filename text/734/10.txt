the ability and commitment to
do the job well.

I feel totally that the main
reason for a students' union,
such as ours, is' to improve
conditions and life for its
student members, not to assist
people on an ego-trip or to
adopt ineffectual external
policies. But having said that
there is room for union
campaigns on students affairs.
I believe from experience
that the C C U ' s have closer
contact with students and
their individual demands. So
ICU must continue to have the
three C C U ' s to listen and act
in their own capacity and
report to ICU the general
feelings of the students. One
thing I shall push for is greater
involvement from Post-
graduates in student life and
the CCU's. The fact that PG's
generally don't take part in
student life, for whatever
reason, means that the union
is wasting half its available
social and academic talents.
The responsibilities affecting
the post I am running for
range from the organising of
transport to the organising of
meetings. The latter of which I
have had experience at and
can handle quite
compentently. The transport
subject is one that has
aroused controversy, however
I feel a certain amount of
common sense and prior
planning on both sides could
sort this out.
These are my views on the
Union and how it could be
improved and are my platform
on which I wish to be elected.
Thank you for taking time to
read it, and I hope you find it
agreeable enough to vote for
me.
Yours
Di Colley

Michael Newman
proposed by Lance Holland
Every year students complain
about the lack of choice in the
sabbatical elections,
resignising themselves to
another year in which their
Union is thrown away. Every
year our Union has become a
joke to college, outside bodies
and its own members. Every
year the Union fails to get the
support of its members. Every
year the students blame the
sabbaticals and the
sabbaticals blame the
students.
I am standing because after
3 years of contributing to
Union clubs and of
continuously criticizing the
sabbaticals, students and the
Union structure I believe I
have gained the knowledge,
experience, and above all the
WILL to bring about change.
I believe sabbatical posts
have far too long been treated
as Youth Opportunity Training
Schemes for administrators
and media. It is about time we
had a Union that represented
its members, that informed its
students, that encouraged
them to contribute, that had
their respect, that was willing
to change.
Do not throw your Union
away. Next year can be
different, it is your choice. The
Union mascot is the Phoenix,
it is surely time for it to fly
again.
Candidates
for the post of FELIX EDITOR and Print Unit
Manager
Dave Jones, who has been returned unopposed has written a statement of intent
Dave Jones
Since the beginning of term I
had been expecting to have to
fight a hard election campaign
to win the FELIX editorship.
Nigel's surprise decision to
withdraw left me unopposed
when papers came down last
Friday. This is not the way I
would have wished to get the
job; editor of FELIX is too
important a post to be won
without a struggle.
Nevertheless I am confident
that I have the commitment
and enthusiasm to produce
an exciting newspaper and
to encourage students to
contribute.
In two and a half years at
College I have come to regard
FELIX as one of the most
worthwhile aspects of life at
IC. Though it is published on
behalf of IC Union, the paper
is widely read by staff and
students alike, and is the only
medium which reaches
everyone in College. Because
of this, FELIX provides
students with a platform for
discussion that is sadly
lacking elsewhere in the Union
structure. ICU is described as
'apolitical' and whilst this
stance is laudable, it too
frequently manifests itself as
anarchy at UGM's. The FELIX
letters and opinion pages are
there for anyone in College to
use to discuss issues of
importance.
This year's FELIX has been
generally very popular, but
some parts of the paper have
tended to look dull andfctale
because of unimaginative
layout and a lack of
illustrations. Next year I aim to
expand the range of articles,
and adopt a more exciting
presentation of the sections
which have been allowed to
go to waste. In addition I hope
to be able to brighten up the
paper with more comic-strip
cartoons, puzzles and
competitons.
As this year's news editor I
have been happy with the
standard of news coverage in
most issues, but FELIX still
has room for many more
reports and news features.
Imperial College is a rather
insular place and its
newspaper sometimes reflects
this. Next year's FELIX will
report on more stories of
student interest outside IC,
both in London and on a
national level.
Student involvement is the
driving force behind any
university newspaper. I hope
that you will wish to take a
part in the production of your
newspaper, and that you enjoy
reading FELIX next year.
