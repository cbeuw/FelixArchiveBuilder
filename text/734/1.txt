Unpopular Press
An alternative Guildsheet appeared in the departments of City and Guilds College on
Monday. The magazine was produced in the old format of stapled, duplicated sheets,
rather than the new lithographed version. It featured articles satirising the Guilds Exec
as well as Motor Club and the Mascotry Team.
Production involved the removal of .the Union Office Gestetner, which was followed by
a retaliatory action of taking the STOIC Video-recorder.
After the theft of the Gestetner. A
note was left saying the m a c h i n e
w o u l d be returned before it w o u l d
next be needed, signed by the
'Fluffy Rabbit M a s c o t r y T e a m ' .

suspicious. H e went upto the
S T O I C r o o m on the top floor,
and found the missing
Gestetner there. However,
unable to repossessing the

S T O I C video-recorder as a
means of retaliation.
O n M o n d a y , the Gestetner
was returned w r a p p e d in
C h r i s t m a s paper, however it
was found later that the paper
tray no longer w o r k e d properly.

S T O I C intact.
T h e Guildsheets p r o d u c e d

After the initial storm over the
paper, F E L I X received a letter
from the editors apologising for
any offence c a u s e d by the
publication. T h e y a d d e d that
the p s e u d o - G u i l d s h e e t w a s

Death In Chemistry
A man was killed while using
the 'pater-noster' lift system in
the C h e m i s t r y - B i o c h e m i s t r y link
at 9:00am on Tuesday. T h e
accident h a p p e n e d between
Levels 5 and 6 of the building
while the man was trying to
take a plank of w o o d d o w n one
floor in the lift. T h e w o o d ,
measuring approximately 6' by
3', b e c a m e jammed between his
compartment and the platform.
It is thought that the w o o d bent
and s n a p p e d , c a u s i n g serious
w o u n d s to the man's neck and
head.
Shelly Fuller, a m e m b e r of
Biochemistry staff, heard the
noise on the 6th floor and
rushed to the scene of the
accident. S h e found the man
bleeding profusely from the
head, on level 5, having
managed to get out of the lift.
S h e rushed d o w n to level 4 to
get help, and found that the lift
had finally stopped.
Biochemistry Departmental
Safety Officer Eric Matthews
and Kevin C o p e arrived
promptly, to administer first aid
to the man, and an a m b u l a n c e
was called. The a m b u l a n c e
arrived after 20 minutes, and he
was rushed to hospital. He died
from his w o u n d s later.
The man was a m e m b e r of a
firm of subcontractors carrying
out maintenance work for the
Biochemistry department. It is
not clear as to why he used the
pater-noster to carry s u c h a
large piece of w o o d d o w n one
floor, as there are notices
warning against transporting
large objects by it.
Miss Fuller, Mr Matthews and
Mr C o p e were c o m m e n d e d by
C o l l e g e Safety Officer Dr
G o r d o n Hargreaves and
Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves for their extremely
prompt action. T h e
a m b u l a n c e m e n were also
c o m m e n d e d for arriving rapidly
in heavy rush hour traffic.
The pater-noster is thought to
have stopped automatically,
although M r Reeves is
appealing for witnesses to c o m e
forward, and to ascertain
whether s o m e o n e did push the
e m e r g e n c y stop button.
