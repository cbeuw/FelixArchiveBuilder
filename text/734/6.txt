Relative relatives solution
Claudia was the mother of
Henrietta. Henrietta was
married to Humphrey
Ignatious was Humphrey's
brother. The unnamed person
was Ignatious' child.
Who made which statement
is obvious from the above.
Ok, so it wasn't that d.iffieul
It seems that it was possible
to guess the solution without
actually working it out
completely logically (and thus
showing that the solution is
unique). Nobody actually
provided a proof although
everybody got the same
answer (several people
actually admitted that they
couldn't find a way to prove
their solution). The full
solution is quite long and
since there's not much space
this week I'll just say that I'll
provide it for anybody who's
interested. The winner was
Andrew Palmer Maths 3. You
can collect your prize after
Monday lunchtime. Beware
everybody, the next
permutation type problem
really will be difficult!
No new problem this week,
since there will be a double
page of puzzles in the Easter
issue. We do need some good
puzzles to put in it though, so
if you know (hand them in)
any, could you drop them into
the FELIX Office, you'll get a
credit i.f they're used, promise!
