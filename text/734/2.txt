o College want to introduce a
new disciplinery procedure
They intend to allow the
appeals committee to
increase the sentence. The
Union has pointed out tha.
this is against all sense of
natural justice. It
discourages students from
appealing.
College has ignored
Union protests. If College
pass this procedure, the
Union should refuse to
cooperate. This would
make the procedure
unworkable. If this
procedure is adopted
without opposition,
students might as well
forget their right of appeal.
Sabbatical Elections
Next Monday and Tuesday
you will have the
opportunity to decide who
runs your Union. Take it.
The Union has a turnover
of £250,000. The Union
candidate has more votes
than all the remaining
candidates put together.
Only the candidate with the
lowest number of votes is
eliminated at each stage.
If you wish to abstain in
any election, write
'ABSTAIN' across the
voting paper. If the number
of absentions exceeds the
number of valid votes an
election will be run in the
summer term, except in the
case of the election for
FELIX editor. Voting takes
place in all departments on
Monday and Tuesday of
next week (March 10 and
11) You must bring your
union card when you vote.
In each of the four
elections you indicate your
first choice candidate by
placing a figure '1' against
his/her name on the ballot
paper. You must not mark
the papers with a tick or
Candidate A I
Candidate B 1
Candidate C 3
Valid voting paper
Candidate A
Candidate B X
Candidate C
Candidate A i
Candidate B i
Candidate C
Invalid voting papers
present your views to
College If you want your
lectures, libraries,
residences or halls to
improve next year, make an
effort to find out who are
the best candidates. There
are manifestos on pages 8,
9, and 10 of this weeks
FELIX. Read them and try
and decide who to vote for.
. Make the effort to vote—a
bad President can ruin your
clubs, societies and halls.
Sabbatical Voting
ICU sabbatical elections
are run on a single
transferable vote (STV)
system This permits voter
to indicate an order of
preference amongst the
candidates. If your first
choice candidate is
eliminated after the initial
count, your vote will be
transfererd to your second
choice. This reallocation of
j votes continues until one
production. So Tony
agreed with the Chaplaincy
to print Chi-Rho on
Saturday. All evening I was
in hall, near my phone,
feeling ill and unaware
there was any problem.
Had Chi Rho been
disatisfied they should have
phoned me.
The Print Unit has only
one litho and one printer.
This means that if one job
causes problems, the
following jobs are held up.
We attempt to give
customers accurate
estimates of when we will
finish work. We can not,
though, guarantee when we
will complete a job. There
is no need for me to keep
customers informed of our
progress on their job if
Tony is working because
he is perfectly able to tell
people how much longer
we will be.
On at least two occasions
this term I have paid
personally for the printing
of Chi-Rho. Perhaps the
Chaplaincy would like to
offer to pay the bank
charges that I incured
through doing that.
Christians, I thought, are
mean't to be understanding
and tolerant. We have had
enormous problems this
year printing anything. I
would have hoped that
West London Chaplaincy
would have shown some
understanding and
tolerance. I would have
hoped, they could have
forgiven us. Instead the
w*!?*kers wrote a letter
(they didn't have the guts
to complain to me
personally) that irritated me
and, far more importantly, a
very loyal and dedicated
cross,; this makes you vote
invalid. To indicate a
second chioce place a '2'
against your coandidate of
next preference to show a
third choice write a '3', and
so on You need not put a
number against every
name. Do not mark the
same number against two
candidates.
Chi-Rho
If you look at page 4, you
will see a letter from the
editors of Chi-Rho, the
newsletter of West London
Chaplaincy. They complain
about the way I have
looked after the printing of
their newsletter. Last Friday
I went home at 6pm
because I was ill, Tony
warned the Chaplaincy that
Chi-Rho was late and said
that he would tell them how
things were going.
Unfortunately election
publicity held up the
member of permanent
staff—Tony. I doubt that
Tony will work for them on
a Saturday in future.
Most of the student
members of FELIX staff,
who give their valuable
time to help the Print Unit,
have also been irritated by
this letter. I think Chi-Rho
might have problems
getting them to help in
future.
The Editors of Chi-Rho
have shown themselves to
be thoughtless, gutless and
selfish. They are about as
bad an advert for their
religion as could imagine. I
am sorry if I have offended
other members of West
London Chaplaincy. Its just
that letters offending the
permanent staff are not on.
Permanent Staff
The Union staff in the
Union Office, the FELIX
Office, the Snack Bar and
the Union Bar are some of
the most loyal and
dedicated people I've ever
had the pleasure of
meeting. Certain clubs,
societies and individuals
treat them like morons. The
Chi-Rho letter to FELIX is
only of one numerous
examples of
thoughtlessness I could
give you. Please be polite
when dealing with the
permanent staff. They do
work hard for you.

Guildsheet
Appologies
We would like to make the
following points about the
publication entitled
'Guildsheet' which appeared
on Monday morning we 'eel
that most of the conter was
reasonable satire and
fulfilled it's aim of mak ng
people think about Guilds.
However we realise that ir
our haste we may have
made decisions given time
we might have made
differently and some people
may have been deeply
offended in a personal way.
Not to apologise would be
very wrong and in the spirit
of that which we attempted
to satire we wish to re-state
that the publication was
never mean to be attributed
to C & G or to dissuade
people from getting involved
in Guilds, and we deeply
regret any personal offence
taken or inconvience
-aused.
