Choir

Hopefully you will all by
now have recovered from
the devastating experience
of seeing and haearing IC
Choir and IC Symphony
Orchestra together in the
Great Hall last Friday. If
you haven't yet regained
your senses after the
stunning performance of
Mahler's 2nd Symphony,
then be warned! There's
only a week to go before IC
Choir unleach a night of
passion on the
unsuspecting masses! But
more of this later...
Before getting on to the
interesting bits of this
article, here are some
boring facts. The Choir's
history began in 1949,
when an senior lecturer in
Electrical Engineering,
named David Tombs,
collected together and
trained a small male voice
choir to sing at that year's
commemoration day
ceremony. In January of
the following year, Imperial
College Choir was founded
and has since gone from
strength to strength,
building up an enviable
reputation for high musical
standards. Over the years
we, have performed such
diverse works as
Monteverd's Vespers,
Stravinsky's Symphony of
Psalms' and Beethoven's
Mass in C to name but
three.
The Choir currently
consists of about 150
members who usually meet
every Thursday evening in
Mech Eng 342 to rehearse
material for forthcoming
concerts. Since 1953, the
Choir has been conducted
by Prof Eric Brown of the
Civil Engineering
department, whose
enthusiasm has contributed
greatly to the development
of the Choir.
As well as holding weekly
rehearsals, the Choir has
two weekends away during
the year. These weekends
offer valuable rehearsal
time in beautiful
surroundings and enable
the choir members to get to
know each other better.
The first of these was at the
beginning of this term,
when we spent a weekend
rehearsing and relaxing in
the Tudor splendour of
Cobham Hall, in the Kent
countryside. At the end of
the Easte, vacation, we
shall be visiting 'Pigotts' in
Buckinghamshire—a
converted farm which is
now more accustomed to

the sound of piccolos and

tractors.
However, the highlight of
the year, is certain to be
our forthcoming concert
next Friday. For just £ 2 . r
(students) you will be able
to hear a memorable
performance of J S Bach's
St Matthew Passion. This is
perhaps one of, if not the
most famous of Bach's
choral work's. It was first
performed in 1729 in
Leipzig: unfortunately, the
first performance of this
and other major works by
Bach were, in the words of
one modern scholar of
music, presented in student
performances of mediocre
quality. IC Choir, however,
can promise a dramatic and
moving performance of
excellent quality, which is
certainly not to be missed.
The concert will take place
in the Great Hall at 8.00pm
on Friday 14th Of March.
Tickets are bound to be in
short supply, so hurry to
buy yours now from Choir
members or from the
Haldane Library.
If you're interested in
singing with us next term,
then come along to the first
summer concert rehearsal
on Thursday 20th March at
5.45pm in Mech ENg 342.
Alternatively, you could get
in touch with Jose Molina,
the choir chairman (Room
626 Huxley, tel Internal
5779).
