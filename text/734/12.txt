Despite the weather, which
eventually turned out better
than expected, we all went
up to Essex to compete in
the Lea Valley R C time
trial. We rode in pairs on
what could be called a
'sporting' 25 mile course.
The Imperial College times
were:
S Heyhoe (Brocklesby
C C ) , P Hartigan 1 hr 9 mins
18 sees
M Bell, J Hayes 1-10-01
J Gilday, A Mason
1.11.24 (includes 4 minutes
due to a puncture).
S Turlte, R Newton
1.13.42
M Farrow, K Hunter
(Lady) 1.15.24
W Morley, M Whitaker
1.17.21
The event was won by G
and K Platts of Chamwood
C R C in an incredible time
of 57-55, considering the
cold wind sweeping much
of the course. Thanks go to,
John and Andrew for
driving.

and C & G fielded strong
teams with a close result
expected despite the claims
of 'a piece of piss' by the
R C S squad.
After the first round
Guilds had a slight lead
due to a score of 172 from
P Deeks, which was to put
him in 3rd place overall,
even though he had only
fired full-bore pistols twice
before. The second round
saw R C S edge into the lead
with a score of 179 from
their captain S Considiene
who achieved 2nd place
overall. The third round put
C & G back in the lead with
S Brooker scoring 180 to
win the individual event.
With one RCS person left
to shoot the match could of
gone either way but the
pressure was too much,
and Guilds won by the
narrow margin of 8 points.
SF Soc
Gazing up from his
examination of the Keller
Machine, the Doctor
suddenly became aware of
a thunderous roar from the
distant cells—the same
tumult which had
preceeded Barnham's
treatment...and Linwood's
death. Whatever had
motivated the inmates of
Stangmoor to such raucous
behaviour, it was about to
happen again...
Then the Machine started
up.
Began to throb. Pulse.
Whine.
And erupted into a ball of
flame.
'Doctor,' screamed Jo
Grant, 'what's the matter?
• What are you doing?' The
Doctor cringed on the
, floor, a few feet from the
steadily humming device,
sweating profusely like a
rabbit in a head-to-head
with a Juggernaut.
'Fire,' he gasped.
'The...idiot's Video
Recorder is on fire.'
'No!'

'P-P-Peri?' stammered
Sarah Jane.
'This is even worse than I
thought, Brigadier. He's
even got the tapes mixed
up!'

'Or, Grandfather?'
'Or? Or?' The Doctor
snapped testily. 'It's

asked Leela.
'He can reverse the polarity

QT
The story so far:
Once upon a time there
was a Q T cabaret. This was
a quiet unassuming sort of
cabaret that lived in a
deserted lecture theatre in
Huxley. The cabaret starred
two endearig young
genlemen who called
themselves the Brown
Paper Bag Brothers, and
who did amusing things
with supermarket holdalls.
The two brothers were very
happy because lots of
people came to see their
show, the people laughted
loudly and threw paper
bags all over the place.
But then along came a
wicked caretaker and
banished the cabaret to a
dark, smelly dungeon in th
Maths department.
Undaunted the cabaret
continued, and in the cold
and the damp, by the light
of a single candle, a
nobleman by the name of
Mark Stee! enthralled the
masses with tales of
everyday life.
And now:
This is the BIG O N E ,
Y O U WILL N O T WANT T O
MISS. For I can tell you
now that on Tuesday 11th
March in Huxley 144 at
exactly 1pm the cabaret
WILL RETURN. Bigger,
bouncier and packed with
extra vitamins, this new
cabaret will put a song in
your heart, a spring in your
step and a biro up your
nostril. 'The Cagey Bees,' a
well known comedy act,
will do their best to make
life worth living for a
minimal fee. If the Cagey
Bees are anything like as
good as the other cabarets
then they are definately
worth a visit. After all, eight
million crustaceous can't
be wrong, can they?
Silwood Ball

C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S to
the newly elected officers,
and best wishes for the
coming year.
Now, here's the news
you've all been waiting for:
the R C S U Annual Country
House Ball takes place next
term, on Friday 2nd May, at
Silwood Park, Ascot. The
evening promises to be one
of unbridled hedonism,
starting in College with the
sherry reception, then by
coach to Silwood for
Champagne reception,
sumptuous meal, croquet
on the lawn, bar extension
and dancing 'til 3 am. This
is undoutedly going to be
the highlight of both the
R C S and ICU social
calenders, but
unfortunately we are
limited to just 90 double
tickets. Applications for
tickets, in the form of a
cheque post-dated to next
term, are open to everyone,
and will be accepted every
lunch time during the last
two week of thjs term, in
the R C S U office,
3outhside. And the cost:
£40 per double ticket.
