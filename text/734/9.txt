Martin Taylor
proposed by John Ingham
J Martin Taylor has the unique
qualifications, experience and
aptitude to be ICU President
next year. I have been
impressed by his involvement
in the Union, and by the work
he has done as Academic
Affairs Officer this year. He
has valuble experience of
College committees, such as
Board of Studies and Student
Residence.
Having been both a
postgrad and undergrad
student at IC, in two
departments and two C C U s ,
he has a real understanding of
and interest in the problems
students face. He has an
enthusiastic approach to all
areas of Union activity, and is
always friendly and
approachable. I therefore have
no hesitation in
recommending that you vote J
Martin Taylor for President.
Jon Ingham
The Union is in a dangerously
run-down condition. Most
students find it is out of touch
with their needs, and
incompetently run as well. I
am standing for President
because I want to give the
Union a fresh impetus, and
because I have the experience
to put new ideas into action
without spending six months
learning the job.
•Improvements must be made
to the Union Building to make
it the social centre of College.
Taking over the Bar was only
a first step—few students have
noticed any difference.
• W e must continue to press
for improvements in teaching
standards, with the College
worried about falling
applications.
• C C U activities get large
numbers of students involved,
and must continue to be
supported. I also support
efforts to broaden their appeal
even further.
•Refectory profits quadrupled
last term compared with last
year. Mr Northey's
refurbishment plans for the
refectories must not be at
students' expense.
• W e must play our part in
defending education against
government cuts. Ideas such
is a 24 hour work-in should
be used next year.

Candidates
for the post of DEPUTY PRESIDENT of IC
Union
Jackie Peirce
proposed by Hugh Stiles
Jackie has a firm grasp of how
the Union runs having
attended several Councils and
Union Finance Committees
(not to mention being a
regular visitor to the Union
Office). She is familiar with
C C U workings and is under
no illusions as to the workload
that being DP would bring.
The Union needs a DP who
can tackle the job without first
having to learn about the
Union structure. Experience
counts—vote for Jackie.
Hugh Stiles
Jackie Peirce Candidate for
Deputy Pres Proposed by
Hugh Stiles
During my three years at
Imperial College I have
maintained an involvement
with the students' Union at
every level, from being an
ordinary member of its clubs
to being Vice President of one
of its Constituent College
Unions. Through that
involvement I feel that I have
reached a position where my
familiarity with, and
experience of, the Union in
general, how it works and the
problems it faces, will allow
me to make a real and
effective contribution to its
running in the coming year.
The Deputy President is
responsible for the Union's
finances, so it is vitally
important that he/she be able
to gain the confidence and
support of the Union Finance
Committee, so that it will
always be working towards
maximising the benefit, for all
IC students, that we can gain
from our limited resources.
The coming year will be a
highly challenging one for the
DP in particular, especially
with the changes taking place
around the Union Building,
besides which it is always
essential that the DP, as a
member of the executive,
make whatever contribution
they can in every area of the
Union. This all requires a
great deal of committment and
energy, both of which I hope
you will give me the
opportunity to provide.
Paul Shanley
proposed by Steve Blake
Shan is the sort of bloke
whose mother denies all
knowledge of knowing him. If
he was a horse, he would have
been put down by now. He
was born in Hammersmith and
brought up (vomitted) in
Wimbledon, which accounts
for his lovable cockney
character and charm.
Shan's been known in the
past to indulge in a pint or ten
of Red Stripe although he very
rarely drinks and stands up at
the same time.
His enthusiasm for the
college is quite simple—he
hasn't got any. If elected to
the post of deputy union
'president his first task will be
to demand a recount owinp io
the fact that he realises he's
got about as much chance of
getting in as Carl Burges has
of learning what a lavatory is
used for.
If Shan does get elected,
he'll take all his friends out for
a drink. Then the three of
them will probably go on
somewhere else afterwards.
He comes from a strong
Irish background (who
•doesn't?) which accounts for
his sick sense of humour and
good looks.
Shan lives (occasionally) in
that wellknown home of good
taste, Holbein House. The
place has really welcomed
Shan with open arms in much
the same way as a goldfish
does when it sees its first
bicycle pump.
The reason for electing him
is clear—He's the best man for
the job. (At the time of writing,
he's the only man for the job.)
His hobbies include
drinking, driving half an Austin
Princess, donating money to
such charities as Watneys,
Charringtons, Charles Welles
and Whitbreads, and upsetting
people.
Shans main election pledge
is to turn the Rectors house
into a new hall of residence-
Ash hall.
A Vote for Shan is a vote for
freedom
