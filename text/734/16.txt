Nightline Crisis
The future of the West
London Nightline Service
now looks uncertain. A
meeting of College
Secretaries from London,
including J o h n Smith from
Imperial, felt that given the
student orientation of the
service, student unions
should support it from their
funds. They mentioned the
example of the Q M C
organisation, which is itself
funded by the student union
there. They proposed that a
fund be set up to which
each college union involved
would contribute whatever
money it has available.
IC Union Welfare Officer,
Pete Wilson said that the
Secretaries had made a
mistake, since without
funding Nightline will lose
its sole sabbatical, and
without one the entire
service will fold. H e added
that Nightline are looking
into alternative funding in
order to provide a breathing
space for the organisation
while its eventual fate can
be decided.
