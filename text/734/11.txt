Princess Ida By Gilbert and
Sullivan
Opsoc's last few February
shows have been
remarkably consistent, both
in the good points and the
bad, and die-hard Gilbert
and Sullivan fans like me
have come to regard as
traditional such features as
clear, confident singing
from the principal soloists,
an extravagantly lavish set,
and a strong performance
from the main comic, as
well as less clear, confident
singing from minor soloists,
a chorus with no room to
move on the concert Hall
stage, and very bad vocal
balance.
Partly because of
Gilbert's treatment of the
solists and partly because
of the skill of the producer,
this production was notably
different.
But it was Barbara
O'Neill as Lady Blanche
who stole the show utterly.
From her first appearance
as the austere blue-
stocking, through her
temptation and seduction
by Melissa to her eventual
connivance with the plans
of the transvestities, she
was totally captivating.
Particularly impressive was
the delivery of her 'abstract
philosophy' speeches.
Gilbert's words need
excellent diction; Miss
O'Neill didn't miss a
syllable, and her timing was
first rate.
Do the Snack Bar Bop
Not Princess Ida
Over the last few years IC
Dramsoc have developed a
reputation for high
standard producitons.
Kennedey's Children
(March 12th-15th, Union
Concert Hall) will enhance
this reputation. The play is
set in an American bar on
14th February, 1974.
Wanda is a middle aged,
middle class prude.
Sparger is a drag queen.
Just when you thought it
was safe to go back into
the Union Building—they're
back! Yes, the unthinkable
has happened Norman and
Not a Leather Nun
the Nutburgers have
reformed. This
unprecedented step has
been taken in the public
interest just for you. You
lucky, lucky people.
Their reunion gig (surely
one of the major milestones
in rock 'n' roll history) will
take place tomorrow,
Saturday the 8th March.
The venue? Back where it
all started—the Union
Snack Bar.
The momentous event,
apart from being an
unmissable opportunity to
see in action one of the
most talked-about garage
(well, kitchen actually)
bands on the music scene
today, may well provide the
answers to some burning
questions. Has Charlie
learnt to sing? Will Norman
wear those shades? Will
Duncan be sober enough
to find the stage, let alone
see his drum-kit? What new
choreographic
masterpieces have Karin
and Roo dream up? Will
Andy achieve his lifetime
ambition to play a three-
note guitar break? Will the
band be able to transcend
the ultimate
accolade—enshrinement in
legend on the walls of the
Mech Eng Toilets?
Rona is a hippy. Mark is a
Vietnam G l . Carlo is a third
rate actress. The five of
them explain how the
American dream hasn't
happened for them. The
theme is a little cliched.
Most of the charcters have
been written about before
and examined in more
detail. The Gl who has
flipped is portrayed far
more graphically in the
Deerhunter.
Having criticised the
play, I'd better praise the
acting. Amateur actors
often have problems when
they try to play Americans.
The accents are either mid-
Atlantic or thick deep south
accents. All the actors
avoided making these
mistakes. Sam Duerden as
Rona, the hippy, was
particularly convincing. She
managed to convey a
feeling of wasted
enthusiasm. It is, though,
unfair to pick out one
member of the cast as they
were all good.
Unfortunately the
direction was not always up
to the standard of the
acting. At times it
distracted one from the
acting.
I recommend you go and
see Kennedy's Children as
it is student acting at it
best. It is well worth the
price of the ticket.
Last Friday I spent the
night in St Stephens
Hospital with severe
concussion. However I can
assure you that this had
nothing to do with going to
see The Leather Nun and
Zodiac Mindwarp and the
Love Reaction at the
Greyhound, Fulham, apart
from a certain
chronological relationship.
The Greyhound is not
exactly the easiest pub to
find if you think it is in
Fulham. It is actually
closest to Hammersmith
tube and lies in Fulham
Palace Road. Having
sussed this little red herring
my tubby denim clad
cohort and I arrived to find
an audience of distinctly
wierd and varied types
rolling in from the pub next
door. At the same time the
piped music suggested an
attempt to appeal to both
aging ex-punks and aging
ex-hippies, while the drinks
prices were a half hearted
effort somewhere between
pubs and dreg holes like
Dingwalls.
First on were one Mr.
Mindwarp and his band.
One can best describe this
high energy assault as a
cross between Dr. & The
Medics and Motorhead.
Respledent in german
helmets and comic book
biker gear the foursome
presented a well drilled if
rather, short show of heavy
psychadelia. One gets the
impression that Mr.
Mindwarp does not intend
people to take things too
seriously and this fitted
rather well with his 'Medics
style' stage banter, not to
mention doing Thin Lizziy's
'Rocker' as an encore. What
I read in the press says this
bunch of gonzoid nutcases
will be big, big, big (as
people in the business are
prone to saying). If they
can only get a more
substantial set together
/vithout blowing the whole
olace to pieces I would
agree.
Meanwhile on to The
.eather Nun. who last
•>ured this country as a
Ljpport for a group calted
Throbbing Gristle which
;<d to a series of riots. Well
• • iere was still a lot of
.hrobbing around but the
>
i d
Not an unwarped mind
rioting appears to have
been replaced by a
distinctly good natured
audience. I quickly gained
the distinct impression that
the white haired lead singer
was attempting to become
Sweden's answer to Iggy
Pop with his stage
posturing. He also seemed
to have some ambitions in
the Lou Reed direction as
well, adopting a style so
laid back that it verged
toward going to sleep on
stage. However I fear that
despite The Leather Nun
playing some reasonable
thrash along stuff, both
messrs. Pop and Reed had
tons more originality.
And so to hospitals
which personally give me
the creeps. The junior
nurses were very nice to
me but frankly the senior
staff seemed to have a very
offhand attitude. Also
Norman's food is worlds
above the stuff you get
there (when they let you
eat at all -which they didn't
for a very long time). All in
all a good advert for not
playing snowballs on hard
ice!
