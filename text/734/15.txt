I sat in a puddle last week. I
remember distinctly the
mindblowing sensation of cold
filthy water seeping into my
underwear. It was not a
pleasant experience. Yet before
I had time to grok the situation
fully my mind was jolted into
awareness by a passing football
hooligan who spat on me
without warning. I became
suddenly conscious of the
amazing oneness of the
universe. I knew instinctively
the isness of existance. I found
myself able to harmonise with
the mind-waves of beings from
different worlds, and I could
feel for myself their hopes and
fears, their sadness and their
joys. And all of these feelings
combined to form the vibrant
force of love which
encompasses all things.
The tranquility descending
into my mind was disturbed by
the inexplicable appearance of
a Ten Headed Telephone
Beast. I knew that would mean
certain death if I allowed its
right to exist. 'Be gone', I
screamed 'for you are a mere
figment of my imagination'. It
belched as it was consumed in
flames, but in it's place a
thought-voice resonated.
'Soup', it growled, 'thick
bubbling soup...'
Unfortunately the
management have confirmed
that there will be no soup
available at the Albert Hall on
Tuesday. Instead, however,
they promise a chunky
steaming session from
Esposito, Curiosity Killed The
Cat, and The Patatoe Five. If
you are into jazz funk dance
music, with the odd lentil here
and there, this little do is highly
recomended; if you can find a
ticket. Personally I can not
stand this sort of drivel which is
highly reminiscent of an onion
consomme. For something with
a little more meat, it should be
noted that beefy Maximum
Effect will be playing the Kings
Head Fulham on the 23rd of
March. The band is composed
of the remnants of Nick
Turner's Inner City Unit, but
without the man himself. A
reliable source tells me that
they can be best be described
as a science fiction orientated

version of the Cramps. Well
boogie down there for some
real out of mind experiences.
I was mildly surprised the
other day to discover a tribe of
eskimos living in my fridge.
What shook me though was the
fact that one of them was
languages. These they vv',11 drop
over the unsuspecting populace
will be lured into investing in
the Stock Market, thus creatine
global financial havoc. It is the
that the second wave of ballon;
will attack, dropping signed
copies of the outer London
telephone book. The extra
strain placed on British
Telecom by civilians wishing to
called George Burns. I find it
incredible that western
civilisation has penetrated into
all aspects of every single
culture on Earth. Why should
an Eskimo be named after a
dead Scottish poet? It is
obvious that Scottish nationalist
infiltration is at work. My fears
call relatives in London will
create explosions throughout
exchanges world wide. The
combined effect of ten
thousand exploding telephone
exchanges will, it is believed,
thrust the planet into the
depths of a Nuclear Winter. It is
were further justified when I
discovered that afore-metioned
Eskimos had constructed an
igloo out of a haggis I had
hidden in the freezer
compartment. Having said this
the ski lift which they had built
from fish-fingers and frozen
beans was a work of
engineering brilliance. I have
informed college security of the
eskimo's existence, so there is
no longer any need to worry
then that the nationalists
cooperation with eskimos will
pay off. Without the low
temperature training which the
Scots have purchased it is
inevitable that Scotland will
become the centre of the new
world republic. Watch out boys,
it could happen any time...
I sometimes wonder why I
about food dissapearing from
Southside fridges.
A mysterious letter came into
my possesion over the
weekend. It gave details of a
new campaign by the Scottis1
Nationalists to take over the
world. Their plan is both
masterly and infallible. A
floatilla of thirty thousand hot
air ballons will set sail against
the armies of the world, armed
with copies of the financial
times printed in thirty
bother to stay sober. In fact
most of the time I wonder if I
am sober. Life, I think is just
one wacky game of rugby; just
when you are about to score a
try, only yards away from the
line, some heavyweight gonzo
kicks you where it hurts before
running off with the ball in the
opposite direction. Certainly,
though, a game of good old
rugga does leave you with quite
a mammoth appetite . At this
point I am forced to conceed
that even the thickest of thick
farmhouse soup is insufficient
for a rugby player (boyo). With
this in mind, however, might I
suggest a visit to the Texas
Lone Star in Gloucester Road
surrounded by posters of Wild
Bill Hiccup, one could do little
but have a really transcendental
gut filling time. The Star
charges about eight quid for a
half pound chilli burger with
chips, jacket potato, sour creme
and salad, followed by a wacky
ice cream.
Occasionally I become very
bored with playing pinball and
drinking coffee and sometimes
I feel the need for something
more cultural. With this in mind
I trundled of to the
Commonwealth Institute at yon
end of Kensington High Street
*o peruse a substantial
exhibition on the arts, science,
crafts and technologies of
assorted Commonwealth
countries. I noted with approval
the lifesize model of a stilt
dancer, and a bronze buddah,
during my quick tour.
(Incidently there's a stunning
gold Buddha in Battersea Park,
which is worth the odd snap
and for those who are
interested the Victoria and
Albert has quite a large stone
Buddha on display.) The
Institute will be staging an
exhibition on the 'struggle and
survival' of the Carribean from
the 6th of March. Gloria
Huniford freaks can catch her
there on the 26th.
The whims and fantasies of
trendies never cease to amaze
me. I am somewhat doubtful
that the recent yuppie craze of
duckfeeding will ever catch on.
For those who wish to increase
their street credibility getting up
on Sunday morning armed with
a loaf of bread seems to be the
in thing to do. The nearest, and
as far as I am concerned the
best, duck feeding ground is
the Serpentine in Hyde Park.
There one can attract, amongst
others Canada Geese and
Coots. Whilst the Geese are
excellent with roast potatoes
and carrots, I find that coots
are much easier to smuggle out
under a coat. So there you
have it. As Turgid Appfeldrink,
Iberian Mouse Hunter once
said, 'show me a mouse
dropping and I'll show you an
interesting vegetarian recipe'.
