Guilds Elections
Free
Dr Haluk Tosun, who
obtained his PhD at IC, has
been released from prison in
Turkey. Dr Tosun was
imprisoned in 1983 because
of his membership of the
executive of the Turkish
Peace Association.
It is believed that Dr
Tosun was released because
of Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal ws worried that
Mrs Thatcher woulds take
him to task over the many
reports of torture in Turkey.

papers came down on
Monday. There are four
candidates for the post of

present the posts of Vice
President and Honorary

although unsuccessful
Presidential candidates may
stand for these posts at the
elections U G M . Simon
Childs (Aero 1) is standing
for VP, whilst Anne Driver
(Elec Eng 2) is the only
candidate for Hon Sec.
Guilds President Roger
Preece told FELIX that he
was happy with the calibre

Star Wars Latest
Mr Norman Lamont MP has
replied to questions raised
in the House of Commons
last week over SDI. He has
assured Labour MP Tarn
Dalyell that no request has
been made for Paul Hopler
of the Pentagon to visit the
UK with a view to classifying
likely SDI technology.
However, depending on
arrangements made with the
companies concerned,
research may be subject to
either British or American
law. IC Computing
Professors Robert Kowalski,
John Darlington and Igor
Alexanders were mentioned
by Mr Dalyell amongst the
academics he wished to be
consulted on the value of
SDI. Mr Lamont said he
would not take steps to seek
their advice, although they
would be free to offer
suggestions.
As speculated in last
week's FELIX, Westland
Research has shown interest
in obtaining work from the
United States SDI
organisation. Richard
Ennals, the ex-IC
Computing Department
employee, who first
suggested their involvement,
is giving a lecture on SDI
and the corruption of British
science's at Q M C on
Wednesday March 12.
Banned
•Dave Brennan, the former
Union Bar manager, has
been banned from all
College bars by the

conduct at the RSM
Valentines Party (FELIX,
February 21). College
Security Officer, Geoff
Reeves, has submitted a
report on the incident to the
College Disciplinary
ComnHtee, who have yet to
decide on what action to
take.
Smashed
| ©College Security Officer,
Geoffrey Reeves is taking no
action against the people
who smashed the Southside
shop window two weeks
ago. After speaking to the
culprits, Mr Reeves said he
could find no proof that they
had smashed the window
deliberately.
Fall Out
• A program to replace the
windows in the Huxley
Building is about to begin.
Structural defects in the
building had caused the
present windows to become
a potential danger to
passers-by below, as it was
feared they might fall out.
Coming Soon
•Nicholas Courtney, who
played the Brigadier in
charge of UNIT in the TV
show, Dr Who, will be
paying a visit to IC on
Saturday as part of 'Who
Day' organised by SF Soc. It
is also anticipated that
Patrick Troughton, who
played the Doctor in the late
sixties, will also turn up. The
event starts at 10am in the
Union SCR.
Booze
•Imperial College is hosting
a heat of the Peter Dominic
