W h e n this d r o p p e d o n t h e desk
a s u d d e n s e n s e o f d e j a v u
e c h o e d t h r o u g h t h e office. Did-
n't this get reviewed last m o n t h
on the Playstation? Yes it is t h e
same title, t h e s a m e set o f weird
tables, the same large n u m b e r of
different types o f g a m e s can be
played a n d all u s i n g t h e l o n g
stick to knock t h e r o u n d things
into the pockets. (A cheat here is
not all the balls have to b e pock-
eted. Only about half o f t h e m are n e e d e d in order to w i n - t h e c o m p u t e r o p p o -
nent cheated in this u n d e r h a n d m a n n e r every time). So it is t h e s a m e g a m e , but
not necessarily played in t h e s a m e way.
Firstly t h e graphics. PCs with 3-D acceleration cards w o u l d b e e x p e c t e d to have
better graphics, a n d they do. The s h a d i n g o f the tables is m u c h m o r e detailed than
the PSX. T h e transparent t e c h n o table looks superb. The control m e t h o d is also dif-
ferent. Instead o f the simplistic p o w e r bar there is a slightly m o r e c o m p l e x m o u s e
control m e t h o d using t h e s w i n g of t h e m o u s e to actually control the force o f the
stroke. It d o e s take a bit o f time to
practice it, but within a c o u p l e o f
minutes gentle close shots don't
e n d u p with t h e c u e ball in t h e
pocket. The control m e t h o d w a s
the b a n e o f the Playstation version
a n d with a simple bit of tweaking
it plays a lot m o r e like a g a m e o f
pool. I inally I can r e c o m m e n d it -
very g o o d w o r k fellas.

W h e n this d r o p p e d o n the desk a
s u d d e n sense o f deja v u e c h o e d
through the office. Didn't this get
r e v i e w e d last m o n t h o n the
Playstation?
Wait a minute didn't I just get
a sense o f deja vu a minute a g o .
Deja vu o f deja vu - n o w that's
o d d . A n y w a y Premier M a n a g e r
99 o n the PC is still all about man-
a g i n g your favourite team to the
top o f the league and as m u c h sil-
verware as the cupboard can hold - or if y o u are feeling perverse taking your hated
premier team d o w n to the third division before b e i n g sacked.
With the m e m o r y and disk space of the PC you w o u l d expect s o m e improvement
over the Playstation version. The players actually c o m e with mini photos so y o u can
scare children off by playing the g a m e using the images of Tony A d a m s and Paul Mcr-
son. There is also a lot more detail, with the inclusion of such important details as
youth p r o g r a m m e s a n d scouts for the youth teams. Ihe third improvement has got
to be the abilty to use the m o u s e a n d keyboard. Rather than cycling through millions
of different screens to g e l to the
screen y o u want y o u can use the
m o u s e to get there.
Another improvement over the
PSX version (this is spookily like PC
PoohShark), but it is e n o u g h . It is
the best football m a n a g e m e n t
g a m e currently out, but look out
because c h a m p i o n s h i p manager
is about to c o m e into play.

News
Emotionally Challenged Free ISP for you and me
So, Sony have started releasing details of
their next generation time wasting device
(otherwise k n o w n as g a m e s machine). It
has fairly Impressive stats - getting near
the theoretical m a x i m u m n u m b e r of poly-
gons displayable o n a conventional IV,
and a launch date this winter. K n o w i n g
the Japanese, the US market gets first
pick - expect a realistic UK launch s o m e -
time in A u t u m n 2000.
At its heart it has the e m o t i o n e n g i n e
- a chip that Sony a n d Toshiba claim is
more powerful than the current Pentium
III. Hopefully, if t h e g a m e s are as g o o d
as the released screenshots w e might
just be able to put u p with it b e i n g called
s o m e t h i n g like the e m o t i o n machine.
