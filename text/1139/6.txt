Camborne Coverage
Dear Felix,
I a m writing to c o m m e n t o n t h e space
allocation in Felix. O n t h e 20th February,
the Royal School o f M i n e s played C a m -
borne (note t h e spelling). O n e w o u l d
expect this event to b e well c o v e r e d ,
since it is a major sporting event. In fact,
I w a s under t h e illusion that this w a s t h e
case, with t h e n e w Felix Editor, Dave
Roberts c o v e r i n g t h e m a t c h e s for us.
Imagine t h e surprise in t h e R S M t h e n ,
w h e n expecting a d e c e n t s p r e a d , there
was a brief report o n t h e front page. O n
turning to t h e sports p a g e s at t h e back,
e x p e c t i n g further c o v e r a g e I w a s
shocked to s e e that Fellwalklng h a d a
w h o l e half page. I w o u l d have t h o u g h t
that the remarkable achievement o f c o m -
pleting a w h i t e w a s h for t h e first t i m e
ever over C S M w o u l d merit a p r o p e r
report, not a paragraph for each o f t h e
sports. I did not bother writing a rugby
report, w e w o n for t h e third consecutive
year by the way, since o n e presumes that
the presence o f a Felix reporter o n t h e
touchline negates such things. It w a s
great to have s o m a n y supporters pre-
sent (perhaps t h e DP(C&S) m i s s e d t h e
bus) a n d I h o p e y o u enjoyed yourselves.
Yours truly,
M a t t h e w Cockayne
RSMRFC Captain
I am very sorry you feel this way -1 had
hoped that a front page mention would
please the ACC and other sports clubs, as
I suspect many of you consider me to be
bias against your activities. Still, I'm sure
Dave will cover It fully when you win
next year. - Ed
Welfare Out of Touch
Dear Felix Editor,
I w o u l d like to c o m p l a i n a b o u t t h e ICU
Welfare Newsletter in last w e e k ' s Issue o f
Felix which focuses o n t h e u s e o f ecstasy
and cannabis. It s e e m s that instead o f
impartially providing t h e facts n e e d e d
for p e o p l e to m a k e i n f o r m e d lifestyle
choices, this article has u s e d t h e usual
s c a r e m o n g e r i n g t e c h n i q u e s t o scate
people away f r o m drugs. I c o n s i d e r this
irresponsible a n d unnecessary.
Firstly I question t h e statistic o f 1 in
12 having tried ecstasy in t h e UK, is this
based o n t h e entire p o p u l a t i o n (includ-
ing, say, t h e elderly), or perhaps m o r e
realistically o n a 'young' a g e range o f
maybe 15-25 year olds?
A n d s e c o n d l y , w h y is c a n n a b i s
described as b e i n g relatively harmless
c o m p a r e d only to heroin? There is a lot
o f scientific research w h i c h s h o w s that
cannabis is also relatively harmless c o m -
pared to t h e m o r e socially acceptable
drugs alcohol a n d tobacco, a n d that's in
terms o f its addictive properties, adverse
psychological a n d physiological effects,
a n d also general social p r o b l e m s (e.g.
violence).
The apparently harmful effects o f
cannabis are listed as t h o u g h they are
facts, although the only reliable evidence
currently available suggests that cannabis
may only slightly impair certain cognitive
functions after l o n g term use, a n d m a y
also slightly increase t h e incidence of
m o u t h cancer. T h e s e adverse effects
s e e m small to t h o s e a c c e p t e d to be
c a u s e d by alcohol use, a n d certainly for
t o b a c c o use.
A n d so what if 2 out of 5 people w h o
have u s e d cannabis in t h e last year will
have also tried another type o f illegal
drug? This is hardly surprising consider-
ing that a n y b o d y w h o w i s h e s to u s e
cannabis is f o r c e d to c o m e into contact
with harder substances via their dealers.
This s e e m s to be t h e only gateway effect
of soft drugs leading to harder drugs, a n d
this effect w o u l d b e e l i m i n a t e d if
cannabis w a s decriminalised. The respect
for t h e illegal status o f harder drugs
w o u l d also be restored if decriminalisa-
tion o f cannabis occurred.
I'm not saying cannabis is w o n d e r f u l
a n d e v e r y o n e s h o u l d s m o k e it, its not a
drug that suits everyone and like all recre-
ational activities (e.g. drinking or g a m -
bling) its use requires a certain a m o u n t
of self-discipline a n d sensibility.
It's a b o u t t i m e d r u g issues w e r e
treated realistically, a n d drug users given
a little m o r e respect a n d credibility. After
all there is a difference b e t w e e n respon-
sible d r u g use, a n d d r u g a b u s e - believe
it or not.
U n d e r g r a d u a t e Chemist
I would like to say that I agree (almost)
entirely with this letter. I didn't say any-
thing last week about the Welfare
Newsletter, as I felt It was wrong to com-
ment, but since s o m e o n e else has
brought it up... - Ed
Gnat Chum Comes Out
Dear crossword doers
I feel o b l i g e d to hold u p m y h a n d a n d
admit that I have not b e e n t h o r o u g h
e n o u g h w h e n c h e c k i n g m y crosswords
for spelling a n d content. Please believe
m e w h e n I say that there is n o o n e m o r e
dissappointed that I w h e n a mistake is
printed o n a M o n d a y m o r n i n g . At t h e
m o m e n t I a m t h e sole contributor o f
crosswords to Felix. I try to get a cross-
w o r d o u t every w e e k but this will
b e c o m e increasingly difficult as the exam
season approaches. A n y o n e w h o thinks
they could c o m p o s e a p u z z l e (it's not
that hard) or w o u l d just like to help out
please walk into t h e Felix office any time
or e-mail.
H o w e v e r , I m a k e n o a p o l o g y for
m a k i n g clues ridiculously obscure f r o m
time to time.
Yours

Gnat Chum would also like to apologise
for not producing a crossword this week,
wouldn't he? - Ed
The Origins of Felix
Dear Ed Sexton
M a y I reminisce?
The familiar n a m e used by the inti-
mates in t h e Links Club of the F o u n d i n g
Father o f Felix, that is to say T e d (EH)
H u g h e s , w a s "Felix" - w h e r e that c a m e
from no o n e knew, f r o m his schooldays
perhaps. Felix H u g h e s , debonair, with a
dry wit a n d a satirical cast of m i n d , w a s
a Guildsman a n d a Mechanical Engineer.
H e w o u l d not have a p p l i e d his o w n
n a m e t o t h e C o l l e g e N e w s p a p e r h e
f o u n d e d in 1949, but F C Ewels ( w h o m I
d o not recall) u r g e d its a d o p t i o n as a
m e m o r i a l to its f o u n d e r a n d as a n asso-
nant genuflexion to its ancient cousin
Phoenix.
Felix a n d Phoenix were rivals only for
the services o f t h e c o l l e g e literati.
Phoenix a p p e a r e d o n c e a term; it w a s
a n d still is t h e IC literary m a g a z i n e , a n
outlet for essayists, poets, critics a n d
artists. Felix w a s a n d still is a w e e k l y
n e w s p a p e r of record with topical n e w s
a n d views about events, societies a n d
clubs. It w a s also d a m m e d hard work a n d
no doubt still is.
Those w h o fancied writing in those
days t e n d e d l o b e m e m b e r s o f IC
Scriblerus Club ( n o w defunct) n a m e d
after the eighteenth century literary soci-
ety o f Pope, Swift a n d A d d i s o n . It w a s
dedicated to satirising crimes a n d follies
in t h e use a n d a b u s e of science, m e d i -
cine a n d technology; its tie bore a silver
quill o n a blue b a c k g r o u n d (I still have
mine).
W e all collaborated with Ted H u g h e s
to keep Felix s u p p l i e d with c o p y a n d
c a m e to wield considerable political influ-
e n c e in t h e C o l l e g e - over refectory
prices, for example, or the election o f
society officers. W e all m u c k e d in a n d
f o u n d t h e pace very different in Felix
from Phoenix,- the experience o f both
stood m e in g o o d stead w h e n I later
w e n t to edit Nature.
H G Wells f o u n d e d Phoenix as the
'normal s c h o o l s journal', a n d published
in it t h e first draft o f his novel 'The Time
M a c h i n e ' . E H H u g h e s f o u n d e d Felix a n d
it is his n a m e that is r e m e m b e r e d in the
title o f t h e n e w s p a p e r .

I should reward you with a saucer of milk...
or perhaps something stronger? - Ed
