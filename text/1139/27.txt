ROLLER HOCKEY
Sport In Brief
Stormtroopers, 'B Squadron'
The tournament started at the u n g o d l y
hour of 10:30 a m , with us against Birm-
ingham. They a p p e a r e d to have picked
thugs off the street at r a n d o m a n d paid
them a Fiver e a c h t o play. Their g a m e
consisted o f p u m m e l l i n g the o p p o s i t i o n
whenever t h e referee wasn't w a t c h i n g
and often w h e n he w a s ! Luckily, w e
quickly learnt to skate a w a y f r o m the
players w h o h a d their knuckles scraping
on the floor.
The Imperial plays w e r e m o r e mixed
up than a well-shaken martini, but sim-
ply sterling g o a l t e n d i n g f r o m Nerissa
held t h e m at bay until t h e last s e c o n d s
of the g a m e w h e n they h a p p e n e d into
a fluke goal.
The next match w a s against the best
C a m b r i d g e h a d to offer. D r e w score a
nifty goal late in the match but it wasn't
e n o u g h as they b u l l d o z e d t w o past o u r
borrowed Warwick goalie
After a beautiful t w o g a m e rest w e
c a m e back strong against Warwick with
our plays sorted out; M o a n d Ket driving
the Imperial offensive like a fine-tuned
Ferrari with Narissa a n d Lisanne putting
u p a brick wall o f d e f e n c e . W e achieved
a shut out a n d w e r e just getting d o w n
to s o m e serious offense w h e n the whis-
tle w a s b l o w n .
The closing g a m e w a s with C a m -
bridge, our t e a m h a d i m p r o v e d about
1 5 0 % since the b e g i n n i n g of the tour-
n a m e n t a n d s o m e very fine hockey w a s
had by all, with s p l e n d i d d e f e n c e from
Thor a n d SpeaDFreaK. Unfortunately, the
w e a k keystone was our borrowed Goalie,
w h o let o n e sneak past h i m in the o p e n -
ing s e c o n d s .
A very close fourth in the e n d ; not a
bad effort for a B t e a m that had never
before played together, playing against
A-teams. Massive thanks g o to Nerissa
a n d Lisanne for driving. A n d finally, spe-
cial love to Lisanne's M u m for c o o k i n g
us dinner!
INTERDEPARTMENTAL RUGBY
Civil E n g i n e e r i n g 'Brickies' 76 - 49
Mechanical Engineering 'Spanner Boys'
Rugby M a t c h / R o w i n g (Boat Race)
After last year's debacle w h e n civil lost 25
- 0, the brickies w e r e k e e n to set t h e
record straight - w h i c h t h e y d i d in
t r e m e n d o u s style. A b l i n d i n g start gave
the hard hats an early lead. S o m e incisive
interplay b e t w e e n Stricko's teeth a n d
Gnat C h u m ' s h e a d s o o n put a stop to all
this. W h e n they h a d left the field, the oil
monkeys clawed their w a y back to par-
ity: at half t i m e they lead by t w o c o n -
versions a n d l o o k e d like r u n n i n g a w a y
with it. M e c h Eng's ' O r a n g e l e p r e c h a u n '
Cosby a n d 'village' Stevens w e r e vicious
growling beasts in attack, with Sven a n d
Phil m a k i n g s o m e s t o r m i n g runs. From
here o n in, t h o u g h , Clvil's A n d y ' B i g ' Lit-
tle a n d Brad 'The Bucket' Baskett p u s h e d
the pace u p a f e w notches a n d it all
c a m e together in t h e last five minutes.
Brad e n d e d with six tries a n d 'Big Daddy'
R a m a g e put t w o over the posts. Special
m e n t i o n must g o to G r e g f r o m Civ Eng,
w h o learnt the rules of the g a m e in ten
minutes, then played a stormer.
Switch to the Harlington bar for the sec-
o n d half. T w o boat race teams o f eight
w e r e assembled. Unsurprisingly, Civ. Eng.
t o o k advantage o f their experience a n d
s n a t c h e d the lead straight away, b e i n g
o n e m a n u p after a s m o o t h four s e c o n d
d o w n i n g f r o m lain. M e c h Eng got off
m o r e slowly, but kept a m o r e steady rat-
ing w h i c h averaged slightly higher. The
gap w a s closed a n d there w a s n o clear
water, but the m e c h a n i c s caught a crab,
so the scaffolders could pull away again
to victory. Including t h e football, that
makes Civil 3 - Mechanical 0, time to pull
your w r e n c h e s o u t o f your builders'
cleavage lads!
It s e e m s that the spirit o f the depart-
ments is finally g r o w i n g into s o m e t h i n g
tangible... keep up the g o o d work! Any-
o n e for cricket?
OSC - Basketball
The overseas societies basketball tour-
n a m e n t w a s held o n the 27th February.
The day w a s w o n by the Afro-Caribbean
Society 2nd team. After a long m o r n i n g
w h e n s o m e societies d e c i d e d not to
turn up, the afternoon matches started
to flow more smoothly. There w a s s o m e
high quality basketball m a l c h e s , tight
d e f e n c e a n d inspired attacks.
Fair play to the Lebanese a n d Malaysian
societies for their sporting spirit.
Thanks to all w h o m a d e the event a
success, specially the referee's a n d team
captains.
The next tournament should be football
in the 3rd t e a m . For info mail

JUDQ
The IC j u d o club attended a belt grading
(to g o up a belt) at the L o n d o n Judo
society o n the 28th. Overall g o o d per-
formances by the people present m e a n l
that the club n o w boasts m o r e r a i n b o w
colours than must really exist. Congrat-
ulations to Danuta, Chris, Nicholaides,
David a n d D u n c a n .

SKIING
Overall, the day w a s fairly normal with
g o o d performances by the w h o l e t e a m
as usual (4th overall in parallel racing,
2nd overall in individual times, 3rd place
s n o w b o a r d i n g for Dave Best!).
However, the captain w a s noticed hav-
ing very friendly discussions with the
UCL club president. Rumours have it
that he w a s asking for certain services.
The captain w a s later beaten in the race,
his excuse b e i n g that he w a s laughing
at the UCL club president's fall. Arrogant
f r e n c h m a n , serves h i m right!
ULTIMATE FRISBEE
IC 21 - 4 Kings
It w a s n o surprise w h e n Kings turned up
(late as usual) with only 5 player (at least
7 n e e d e d for a team). Fortunately, d u e
to an unusually k e e n turn-out by IC (all
except 'Worship m e ' , w h o c o m p l a i n e d
of the flu so w a s sent to b e d with his
w o m a n ) , w e c o u l d lend t h e m a f e w of
our (best) players, a l t h o u g h this meant
that Kings h a d to forfeit the g a m e , mak-
ing it only a friendly. This g a m e w a s the
last c h a n c e for a practice before the
National Indoor student finals (yes, that
m a k e s IC in the t o p 16 student teams in
the country!), so the first t e a m w e r e out
to justify their place. As the scorcline
shows, IC d i s p o s e d o f kings with f e w
casualties, but not after s o m e defiant
Kings d e f e n d i n g . The first half w a s an
easy walkover for IC. but c o m e the sec-
o n d half Kings w e r e k e e n to s h o w IC
h o w they c o u l d really play. In the e n d
the score w a s inevitable though, another
ass kicking by IC.
The g a m e w a s played in great spiri
(no fouls there t h e n ) a n d h e l p e d to
build strong links b e t w e e n IC ultimate
t e a m a n d Kings ultimate t e a m . Another
victory m a k i n g it 3 out o f 3 wins for IC
so far in the south-east o u t d o o r league
