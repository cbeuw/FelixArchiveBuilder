"T^v^ Clubscene 8 March 1999
Shine @ The Fridge
Brixton, SW2, Saturdays, 10pm-6am.
£8/£10/£l 2. Capacity -1,000. Dress code
= none.
O n e o f L o n d o n ' s n e w e s t h o u s e
nights this south o f t h e river jaunt only
began t w o w e e k s a g o , a n d quite frankly
it shows. Despite t h e promises o f glitter
cannons, balloon drops, a n d t h e most
stylish night that t h e capital has s e e n in
a while, Shine just doesn't deliver. But it
is not a c o m p l e t e disaster area either. It
is merely a fledgling night trying to learn
to fly in a city full of b i g players.
The first t h i n g that y o u notice is t h e
clientele in t h e club. Shine replaced t h e
gay night Love M u s c l e , a n d t h e r e
appears to be a bit of a h a n g o v e r f r o m
this amusingly-named past incarnation. I
certainly don't have anything against gay
nights or i n d e e d against there b e i n g a
mixed c r o w d at Shine. Indeed, s o m e o f
the best nights a r o u n d a r e m i x e d ,
because y o u feel as if y o u c a n relax
more in t h e anything goes atmospheres.
However, that's not w h a t Shine is trying
to do. It is trying to be a glam house night
w h i c h appeals to, a n d I q u o t e " m o r e
experimental o f the capital's clubbers." To
d o this it must try a n d u p the proportion
of f e m a l e punters w h o g o a l o n g - it w a s
just t o o p a c k e d full o f blokes. N o w I
k n o w that I didn't help by not taking any
girlfriends a l o n g this time, but it's not all
my job, n o w is it?
The music also n e e d s to get a seri-
o u s injection of m e l o d y a n d energy. The
t e m p o m a y have b e e n just about right
but the tracks played by t h e majority of
the DJs w e r e just plain boring. I seriously
can't r e m e m b e r a single tune, a n d n o n e
of t h e m e v e n c a m e close to giving m e
that usual rush that y o u get w h e n y o u
really enjoy a track. Despite the calibre o f
the talent o n s h o w , such as Roy t h e
Roach a n d DJ Dimitri f r o m Paris, the sets
w e r e just mindless, a m o r p h o u s blobs of
d e p r e s s i n g l y t e d i o u s m u s i c . A n d t h e
c r o w d k n e w it t o o despite their attempts
to look happy. You just sensed everyone
w a s g o i n g through t h e motions, wishing
they w e r e s o m e w h e r e else.
But m a y b e this wasn't the case, 'cos
if y o u are g o i n g to g o to any club in Lon-
d o n , t h e n m a k e it The fridge. This is a
s t u n n i n g v e n u e . The main dancefloor Is
h u g e , as is t h e stage area at t h e back, so
there is plenty o f space to g o a n d s h o w
off your moves. A l the s a m e time, if y o u
feel m o r e like hiding away your talents,
or getting u p to n o g o o d , then there are
plenty o f little out-of-thc w a y sections to
e x p l o r e . It m a y b e c o n f u s i n g to get
around this place w h e n y o u are not think-
ing t o o clearly, but it's w o r t h the expe-
dition - every part o f it is great. Just w i s h
the night h a d b e e n as g o o d as t h e club.
Still, not to worry - look out for my review
of t h e legendary Escape f r o m Samsara
(Fridays at The Fridge) in the next issue
of C l u b s c c n e .
As for Shine, don't just take m y w o r d
for it - it isn't all that bad really. A n d it will
get better as they m a n a g e to carve out
an identity for themselves, just give t h e m
a little more time to live up to their name.

'Species'
(Boscaland)
Another t h u m p i n g piece o f sottish
t e c h n o to c o m e o u t o f t h e T r u e l o v e
Label Collective c a m p , this track is an
interesting p i e c e o f vinyl t o get your
hands o n . That's 'cos unlike m a n y other
12" there is a great contrast b e t w e e n t h e
two mixes that y o u get. The Original M i x
is more conventional with a user-friendly
melody, a n d a c o u p l e o f n i c e break-
d o w n s . But it's t h e Trash C o m p a c t o r
Remix which really d o e s t h e business. It's
a dark a n d funky piece, w h i c h m a n a g e s
to work well despite b e i n g quite a bare
track.

Incognito
'Nights Over Egypt'
(Talking Loud)
A nice laid-back n u m b e r from the
Incognito p e o p l e . O n c e y o u get past
the fact that they are singing o n e of the
silliest (but at the same time original) cho-
ruses ever to hit clubland then this record
can really g r o w o n y o u . A soulful, uplift-
ing track that w o u l d sit' well in a n y
garage/soft h o u s e set, this track, (and all
the mixes in the d o u b l e vinyl pack) brims
full o f slick production. A l t h o u g h (quite
expectedly) it's the Masters at Work M a i n
Mix that is b e i n g p l u g g e d , try out t h e
M a w Mix o n the B-side. It's less jazzy a n d
cuts straight to the point. Also took out
for s o m e useful b o n u s beats a n d acapel-
las for all y o u aspiring chilled-out DJs out
there.

Heaven's Children
'Bam B a m '
(TEC)
A catchy tunc in all its guises o n this
12". This is w h a t I like about records like
this - you're getting your m o n e y ' s worth
a n d they'll help y o u build u p that eclec-
tic record collection that you've always
dreamt of. The offspring o f a c o u p l e o f
the (ex?) resident DJs from Heaven, this
track w o u l d cut it o n t h e dancefloor in
any o f its three incarnations The A-side
gives us a m a d a n d fruity "Saturday Night
at Heaven" mix - a g o o d idea of what it's
like at the legendary v e n u e these days,
whilst the D.A.V.E. the D r u m m e r remix is
a bit tougher and, o f course, more drum-
based. But, as is often the case, check
out the Original M i x for a m o r e well-
r o u n d e d p e r f o r m a n c e - this one's a nice
hard houser.

Phats a n d Small
"Turn A r o u n d "
(Multiply)
This is g o i n g t o b e o n e hell o f a
tune. Produced by a couple o f likely lads
from Brighton (and yes they are mates o f
Fatboy Slim), this tune is o n e o f those
catchy, happy, d a n c e tunes you'll either
love or hate but will still e n d u p d a n c i n g
to - a n d if you're not d a n c i n g to it you'll
be s i n g i n g a l o n g to it. Causing a h u g e
storm o n t h e nation's d a n c e f l o o r s , it
c o m e s with a f e w mixes, the best b e i n g
the Original 12". Great dance music (get-
ting t h e blessing o f t h e Radio 1 jocks).
