Ince Inflates Food Fees
Food prices in the ICU catering outlets - D a
Vinci's, dB's, the Wednesday and Friday bar-
becue and the Union Bar - look set to rise
from today by about ten percent across the
board. This will m e a n that curries are n o w
£1.20, a n d a main meal will be around
£2.50. The policy w a s decided o n by the
Union Trading Committee, a n d approved
by Council o n Tuesday.
The reasoning behind this m o v e is
that the outlets are currently running at a
massive loss - expected to be around twenty
thousand pounds by summer. There arc
several factors influencing this loss. Biol-
ogy's move to the BMS (with its College-run
cafe), and increased staffing costs d u e to

the o p e n i n g of the baguette bar in dB's
have had an effect. The final straw however
was an L-U directive entitling part-time work-
ers to holiday benefits, or in the case of ICU
staff, a six percent lump s u m paid every 13
weeks.
Although every effort w a s m a d e to
reduce the losses, the price rises were the
"last resort" according to a m e m b e r of the
Trading Committee, w h o went o n to add,
"We really had n o other option. Catering
was budgeted to break even this year, but
it's making a huge loss." Subsidising the
catering from other Union funds, advo-
cated by the DP (l&S) candidates at the hus-
tings, is "not a g o o d idea."
the move has received a generally
negative reaction from students however.
Responses ranged from "fuck off" to c o m -
plaints that the food w a s supposed to be
a service for students. O n e Union figure
questioned the marketing of the catering
outlets though: if trade could be brought in
from the College outlets then the problems
could be solved. Better advertising o n cam-
pus could help to achieve this.
O n a lighter note, Council approved a
pay rise of five pence per hour for U n i o n
staff, bringing their wages to £3.70 an hour.

Bike Thieves Arrested
A m a n has b e e n arrested
after attempting to steal a
bicycle f r o m C o l l e g e

detained at the scene. It is believed that
the four m a y be o n e of the 'gangs' that
has been targeting Imperial College for
bike theft in recent years. A l t h o u g h
pleased with the men's capture, Chief
Security Officer Ken Weir w a r n e d cyclists

could not guarantee he w o u l d respond to
every letter, he did say he was open to stu-
dent opinion. In the mean time, if you sus-
pect a theft is in progress, find an internal

gency number).

Following up o n the success o f the C h e m -
ical Engineering Revue o n 2 I ebruary
(Felix 1135), t h e Electrical Engineering
s h o w attracted an a u d i e n c e of a r o u n d
100 students a n d staff w h e n the curtain
was raised o n 25 I cbruary.
T h e Revue, o r g a n i s e d b y t h e
Department of Electrical Engineering Soci-
ety, included a d o z e n or so acts covering
the broad spectrum of "entertainment" -
f r o m satirical swipes at senior staff to
musical n u m b e r s f r o m Guilds President
Reuben Connolly (pictured above). Also
included o n the bill w e r e acts from staff,

S p e n c c a n d Peter C h e u n g , w h o fortu-
nately s e e m e d equally h a p p y t o s e n d
themselves up.
A m o n g s t t h e other highlights o f t h e
s h o w w a s Gary Smith's r e n d i t i o n o f
"demonstrator training", w h i c h included
classes o n student confusion, a v o i d i n g
the question a n d confabulation - a n d
struck true with m e m b e r s o f all depart-
ments. Later in t h e first half, five intrepid
students t o o k t o t h e stage t o give a
(thankfully m i m e d ) rendition o f the Spice
Girls. Sadly, carefully c h o r e o g r a p h e d
dance routines s e e m e d to have been for-
gotten, in favour of r a n d o m m o v e m e n t s
across the stage. However, nothing could
prepare the audience for what w a s to fol-
low: after a q u i c k c h a n g e R e u b e n
returned to the stage to perform a re-
w o r d e d version o f Robbie Williams 'Mil-
lennium' - this time entitled 'Engineering'.
In comparison to the painful quality of his
b a c k i n g singers, h e l o o k e d like the
e m b o d i m e n t o f M r Williams himself.
The first s h o w o f its kind in the
d e p a r t m e n t for several years, it w a s
hailed as a triumph by coordinator Sanela
Hodzic. O f course, t h e high attendance
had nothing to d o with t h e free beer o n
offer. Or the suggestion that past papers
w o u l d only be o n sale after t h e Revue...
