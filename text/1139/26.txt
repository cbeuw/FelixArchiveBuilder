Today wasn't g o i n g to b e a n y different.
Although Hurricane Horace w a s b l o w i n g

At t h e start o f t h e 2 n d half, David "

Turning a player with ease (can y o u tell

with a n e m p h a t i c
5-3 victory in t h e
first phase of the IC
Interdepartmental
Tournament.
The m a t c h ,
billed by s o m e as
"the match o f t h e
year" did not fail to
d i s a p p o i n t , with
lots o f goal-mouth
action a n d a feast
of goals. However,
the m a t c h almost
didn't take p l a c e
d u e to t h e late
arrival o f the M a t h s

resulted in a delay
of over 30 minutes.

with another well-
taken goal.
The s e c o n d
half followed pretty
m u c h t h e s a m e
path as t h e first,
with Physics d o m i -
n a t i n g for l o n g
p e r i o d s . Physics
notched u p a third
g o a l early in t h e
s e c o n d half, s c o r e d by their captain
Shubeur. Both teams then had goals dis-
a l l o w e d by t h e referee, (me!) w h o had a

w e r e getting rather frustrated a n d this
frustration w a s c o n f o u n d e d w h e n "the

his hat-trick to m a k e it 4-0. M a t h s finally

M a n a g e m e n t School's t e a m played its
first match against M e c h Eng, a friendly,
over a m o n t h after t h e thought o f form-
ing a t e a m w a s first c o n c e i v e d . In all,
e i g h t e e n footballers braved t h e rain to
play for the team, m a d e worse by the fact
that w e w e r e all in trainers.

t w o excellent goals f r o m Robbi Malan-
drenlotis a n d o n e from Mike, a M e c h Eng
