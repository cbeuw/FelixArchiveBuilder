HOT SEX byTraceyCox
A
part from perhaps God: The Truth,
it is difficult to think o f a m o r e
alluring title than Hot Sex, HowTo
Do It. So w h e n I w a s asked t o review this
book, written by Miss Tracey Cox, I w a s
intrigued as to t h e angle that t h e author
w o u l d take o n this fascinating subject,
and hopeful that 1 might find s o m e effec-
tive metaphysical imagery. O K , s o really
I thought I might learn s o m e t h i n g , a n d
there w a s certainly a great deal o f infor-
mation o n all facets o f sexual relations (as
Bill Clinton w o u l d have it). Although there
is a great deal o n sex, h o w to d o it, a n d
why y o u s h o u l d e v e n bother in t h e first
place, all that I read w a s not particularly
new, or interesting.
The style is very friendly and informal,
and y o u can s e e t h e author's skill as a n
agony aunt for a popular w o m e n ' s m a g -
azine has c o m e in useful in her writing
career. H o w e v e r this c o u l d also b e her
downfall - this b o o k is definitely n o t
aimed at our a g e g r o u p . Hot Sex s e e m s
really to b e a c o m p e n d i u m o f all her
'greatest hits', w h i c h begins t o get quite
irritating by t h e e n d . I don't m e a n that in
a patronising way: I a m referring to t h e
fact that a large proportion o f t h e b o o k
is dedicated to subjects such as dealing
with divorce, w h a t to d o if y o u suspect
your 'partner' is having a n affair, a n d a
huge 3 0 % o f the 350 pages is o n t h e sub-
ject o f contraception, STDs, i m p o t e n c e
(male a n d female), a n d other 'Serious
Sexual Problems', like abortion a n d rape.
I w o u l d like to stress that I don't think
these things are unimportant, a n d they
are definitely not irrelevant, but it is quite
obvious that this b o o k is not meant to be
all f u n a n d g a m e s in t h e b e d r o o m . In
fact, in these m o r e delicate areas t h e
a u t h o r m a n a g e s to b e very sensitive
w h i l e r e m a i n i n g informative, although
n o t h i n g beats a g o o d counsellor.
The b o o k is also quite clearly written
for w o m e n , a n d all 'hints' are written as
if to a w o m a n so that s h e could pass it
o n to her (and y o u definitely get t h e
feeling h e ' s unwilling) male partner. In
m o r e than o n e instance while describing
h o w to give a w o m a n excellent oral sex
(just for example...), t h e instructions run
a l o n g t h e lines of, '...then get him to run
his t o n g u e a l o n g t h e length of your...',
a n d s o o n .
However there is s o m e useful sexual
information, a n d the first w o r d o f t h e
b o o k is masturbation, so it can't be all
bad, but unless you're planning to settle
d o w n to s o m e serious m o n o g a m y , I
w o u l d strongly advise giving this a miss.
Just settle d o w n with t h e good-old-fash-
i o n e d Kama Sutra, a n d try to w o r k out
w h i c h bit g o e s w h e r e o n your o w n .
Well...not o n your own, obviously.

n his sixth published offering, D o u -
glas C o u p l a n d s e e m s to have c o m e
into his o w n . Girlfriend in a Coma
has proved his most critically acclaimed
work, not for its use o f brand h u m o u r or
because it fits nicely into a current soci-
ological trend {Generation X a n d
Microserfs), but simply because it is a
g o o d piece o f writing. Chronicling the
lives o f six friends from their last drug-
filled days o f high school to t h e uncer-
tainty and regret of middle age, the b o o k
is a beautiful e x a m p l e o f t h e m o d e r n
allegory - t h e urban myth.
The first sentence, 'I'm Jared a n d
I'm a ghost.', a n d the first chapter title,
'All Ideas are true', set t h e t o n e for the
rest of t h e book. Narrated at first by t h e
d e a d Jared a n d then by others, w e s e c
the final carefree days o f t h e characters
in high school, full o f promise a n d hubris.
Richard loses his virginity o n a ski slope
with his strangely distant girlfriend a n d
within the hour s h e is in a c o m a w h e r e
she stays for 6,719 days a n d 83 pages.
During this time Richard a n d the rest
of the g a n g have t h e chance to lose a n y
existing direction in their lives. After mov-
ing away to seemingly better things, they
all gravitate back to their old street in Van-
' couver, n o w as b u r n e d out, uncertain
middle-aged adults.
The characters worry a n d o b s e s -
sively self-analyse as they e a c h attempt
to reconcile their pasts, a l l o w i n g Coup-
land to explore t h e t h e m e o f t h e b o o k -
the search for truth. W h e t h e r or not sci-
e n c e students n e e d to be c o n v i n c e d o f
the v a l u e o f q u e s t i o n i n g instead o f
blindly accepting remains to b e seen, but
still a reminder is not a b a d thing. C h a p -
ter titles play a very large role in devel-
o p i n g t h e moral o f the story, progressing
from 'All ideas are true' to 'Reject every
idea', 'Progress is over' a n d finally 'The
End' with c o m m e n t s about c o n t e m p o -
rary society a n d c o n s u m e r i s m .
Following the reunion o f the friends
a n d t h e a w a k e n i n g o f Karen (the girl-
friend), C o u p l a n d m o v e s o n to his vision
of the e n d o f the w o r l d , allowing further
d e v e l o p m e n t o f t h e plot. It is not the
most chilling e n d o f t h e world scenario
(any nuclear physicists or e p i d e m i o l o -
gists care to c o m m e n t ? ) but it d o e s have
an interesting twist.
All in all, a really interesting a n d
multi-levelled read, to w h i c h this review
doesn't d o justice, but not o n e that has
caused a l o n g term alteration in m y per-
spective, although it really has the poten-
tial. I'll just have to read it again.
