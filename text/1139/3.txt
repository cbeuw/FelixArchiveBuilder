In brief...
CCU Presidents To
Pay Rent
C C U presidents will n o longer live rent-
free in Halls for the first t w o terms, after
a motion passed by Council last Tuesday.
A l t h o u g h they still have the o p t i o n of a
r o o m in Halls, they will have to pay for
it. U n d e r the p r e v i o u s s y s t e m , they
w o u l d buy beer for barnights with the
m o n e y they saved o n rent - a legally
d u b i o u s area since the U n i o n c a n n o t
subsidise alcohol. The m o v e also stands
|to save the U n i o n in excess of £5000.
Football Fracas
The IC football S e c o n d s face discipli-
nary action this w e e k after an a l l e g e d
incident o n a train r e t u r n i n g f r o m a
recent match in Plymouth, w h i c h t o o k
place on 24 February. C o m p l a i n t s w e r e
received by College f r o m the train oper-
ator s u g g e s t i n g that a g r o u p of IC stu-
dents had vandalised a train carriage,
n c l u d i n g "breakages, abusive behav-
iour, a n d v o m i t i n g " . The reason for this
behaviour w a s put d o w n to "extreme
nebriation".
A c c o r d i n g to sources close to the
t e a m , the students involved are admit-
ting that their actions did cross the line,
but will ask to be treated sympathetically
as this w o u l d b e their first o f f e n c e .
A Momentary Lapse
of Confidence?
Royal School of M i n e s U n i o n President
Alistair Fox a t t e m p t e d to pass a m o t i o n
of no c o n f i d e n c e in DP (C&S) M a r i e
N i c h o l o a u at U n i o n C o u n c i l last Tues-
day. This w o u l d , if passed, result in her
dismissal from the post, and possibly the
re-running of the sabbatical elections, as
M r Fox espressed dissatisfaction with
her p e r f o r m a n c e as Returning Officer.
However, he did not f o l l o w the correct
procedures (which require h i m to w a r n
the Chair in advance, so that e v i d e n c e
can be g a t h e r e d o n both sides) a n d
the m o t i o n w a s r e j e c t e d . M r Fox
intends to resubmit his m o t i o n at the
next Council, o n 4 May, by w h i c h t i m e
the true m o t i v a t i o n s for his a c t i o n s
should have c o m e to light.

Security Alert to New
Working Week
Turbulent times lay a h e a d
for college security as a
recent t u r o p e a n directive
is set to reform their w o r k i n g w e e k a n d
consequently their contracts.
Designed to "protect the health a n d
safety of workers" the n e w regulations set
a m a x i m u m working w e e k of 48 hours,
placing the responsibility of compliance
with the employer, irrespective of h o w
many c o m p a n i e s an individual may work
for. The directive, which c a m e into force
o n October 1 1998, g o e s o n to describe
a stringent set of working practices includ-
ing regular rest periods a n d free health
assessments for night staff. The college is
currently in contravention of the legisla-
tion, with many security staff w o r k i n g 72
hours a w e e k ; but as G o v e r n m e n t
approval c a m e only a few w e e k s before
implementation, employers have b e e n
given a temporary respite.
Categorised as "self-determining" aca-
d e m i c staff arc exempt f r o m the m e a -
sures as they have a u t o n o m y over their
w o r k i n g hours, the college has b e e n
aware of the working time regulations for
s o m e time, but c h o s e to wait for all
exemptions to be finalised in the h o p e
that security staff w o u l d b e unaffected,
the situation has still not b e e n clarified,
but the college musl n o w face the task of
balancing staff wages with reduced work-
ing hours. Michael Saul, security's Unison
Representative, saw the benefits of the
n e w regulations c o m m e n t i n g "Ifs a g o o d
thing, it stops employers exploiting their
workers", but went on to say "the prob-
lem is security are lowly paid, the only way
to make the j o b sustainable is overtime."
1992 saw the last major upheaval in
college security, w h e r e a proposal to dis-
pense with in-house security staff and
By Andrew Ofori
put a contract out to tender
w a s defeated by the m a g -
nitude of opposition. This
lead lo the introduction of shift work,
and put an e n d to the 48 hour w e e k col-
lege security had previously operated.
"We don't feel w e should lose any-
thing, but I should imagine w e arc g o i n g
lo" was the prediction from o n e security
officer as he explained the a p p r e h e n -
sion of his contemporaries. Another offi-
cer w a r n e d "If they only pay 48 hours...
they could e n d up with a mass exodus".
Ihe Chief of Security, Ken Weir, is
researching into exactly w h i c h of the reg-
ulations applied to his staff and felt offi-
cers had little to worry about al such a
preliminary stage of the reforms, but con-
ceded "Ihe 48 hour working w e e k is likely
to adversely affect the securtiy staff". He
slated he is "currently looking al several
ways in which w e can overcome our legal
obligations that w e r e laid by the working
time directive", explaining "We've got no
legal choice, w e have to m a k e reforms."
Keith Reynolds, H e a d of Security con-
curred: "Whether w c like it or not, we're
g o i n g to have to re-structure to s o m e
degree...we're not g o i n g to be able to
please everybody all of the time", but he
saw the alterations as a chance to create
a better system.
A n y p r o p o s a l s will be subject lo
extensive c o n s u l t a t i o n with college
departmcnls as well as organisations such
as the I lealth a n d Safety Executive and
the final decision lies with the Manage-
m e n l Planning G r o u p . Security's M r Saul
was convinced "they'll [college] approach
it in a sensible way" and Ken Weir assured:
"the security of the college is not g o i n g
to be c o m p r o m i s e d in a n y w a y " .
