Presidential Talk-Back
T

gradually p i c k i n g u p s t e a m , just

There is a petition g o i n g a r o u n d stating
"We the u n d e r s i g n e d believe that t h e
L o n d o n Transport student discount card
is a n important s c h e m e to help alleviate
student hardship, but that it s h o u l d not
discriminate against m a t u r e s t u d e n t s
a n d s h o u l d be available to all students
of all ages." If y o u a g r e e with t h e a b o v e
statement, c o u l d y o u please sign t h e
petition, t a c h year rep s h o u l d have

departmental reps, or sign t h e o n e o n
the front desk o f t h e U n i o n .
C o l l e g e Catering is o f t e n criticised
for cost, but for such a n international
C o l l e g e as Imperial it is also discrimina-
tory. Currently M u s l i m s c a n not eat
m o s t o f t h e m e a l
dishes p r o v i d e d , as
the meat is not hallal

killed in a certain
way.) A s a c o n s e -

This w e e k in
I elix, I'm sure there
is g o i n g to be an arti-
cle a b o u t price
i n c r e a s e s in t h e
U n i o n . Currently w e
are h e a d i n g f o r a
massive loss o n t h e

the increase will b e

m o n e y . A l t h o u g h
m o n e y isn't every-
t h i n g , it is m o n e y
that g o e s towards your clubs a n d soci-
eties. It is perhaps w o r r y i n g that e v e n
with this large price increase, w e are still
far c h e a p e r t h a n a n y o f our C o l l e g e
competitors. C o l l e g e catering this year
has b u d g e t e d e n o u g h to b u y the equiv-
alent o f nine m i n i b u s e s or 1000 return
trips to Harlington (I think that w o u l d
cover training) in profit. It c o m e s d o w n
to ethics. A r e o u r outlets here to m a k e
m o n e y o u t o f o u r students or to offer
t h e m a g e n u i n e service? C o m p a r e any-
t h i n g t h e C o l l e g e c a n put out for £1.20
to o n e o f our curries a n d I think it's
quite clear w h i c h policy t h e U n i o n a n d
the C o l l e g e a r c e m p l o y i n g . It's time Ihe
C o l l e g e realised w h y they are here; t h e
students. ( E m e r g e n c y services please
be o n standby, I think s o m e o f t h e Col-

Fifty Years On
A Gentleman's Newspaper?
Despite only p r o d u c i n g n i n e issues
between D e c e m b e r 1949 a n d t h e e n d o f
the 49/50 a c a d e m i c year, by t h e time .
s u m m e r a p p r o a c h e d M r L M H u g h e s
had m a n a g e d to carve a definite char-
acter for Felix, a n d turn it into an institu-
tion.
Felix in those early years w a s m o r e
of a gentleman's club than a n e w s p a p e r
- a literary outlet for ex-public s c h o o l
friends w h o m o r e c o m m o n l y m e t
through t h e drinking clubs. That Felix
was a private club, o p e n to contribution
but wary o f n e w m e m b e r s , is o b v i o u s
from a flick through o f those early issues.
The 'Felix Board' w a s a n internally elected
t e a m of writers a n d sub-editors, electing
the following year's editor at t h e e n d o f
the s u m m e r term.
Felix's traditional i n d e p e n d e n c e a n d
occasional o p p o s i t i o n to Imperial Col-
lege U n i o n also b e g a n in t h e first year.
The fourth issue s a w a n irate Paul Cum-
ming, then U n i o n President, writing a let-
ter of complaint c o n c e r n i n g t h e previous
week's editorial c o n c e r n i n g Rag fines.
The basic a r g u m e n t w a s that t h e U n i o n
had a g r e e d to pay fines incurred by stu-
dents b r e a k i n g t h e l a w d u r i n g t h e
N o v e m b e r 5th Rag activities, but t h e n
had apparently c h a n g e d its m i n d , feeling
that "for the Union to pay the fines w o u l d
appear as a c o n d o n a t i o n o f the offence,
w o u l d act as a n incentive to students to
break the law in future." M r H u g h e s s u g -
gested that a general m e e t i n g b e called
to debate t h e issue.
Two c o l u m n s a p p e a r e d in t h e sec-
o n d issue. 'Profile' w a s intended to focus
on an individual or institution c o n n e c t e d
to the college, or otherwise o f interest to

readers. The first profile, unsurprisingly,
l o o k e d at t h e history o f the U n i o n Bar.
Apparently t h e first College Bar in the
country, t h e first b a r m a n w a s Jim Pea-
cock, a l t h o u g h he denies this in a
letter p u b l i s h e d later that -
year, c l a i m i n g t h e priv-
e l e d g e to b e l o n g to a
m y s t e r i o u s w o m a n . ,
called Auntie. Appar- f^mr
ently w h e n the;
U n i o n Building w a s
built, t h e bar area
w a s i n t e n d e d as a
secretary's office. Ihe
first U n i o n Secretary, a
M r H o u g h t o n , d e m a n d e d
that it be turned into a bar, a n d
the Union C o m m i t t e e eventually agreed.
Other profiles o f t h e first year included
the Rector, Sir Roderic Hill; Paul C u m -
m i n g , t h e U n i o n President; s o m e local
s h o p k e e p e r w h o w a s blonde, 6 foot tall,
a n d apparently rather g o o d looking; a n d
the Imperial College W o m e n ' s Assoca-
tion, w h o at t h e t i m e h a d just over fifty
m e m b e r s . The c o l u m n c o n t i n u e d very
successfully for Felix's first five years,
before b e c o m i n g s o m e w h a t m o r e spo-
radic in a p p e a r a n c e .
The s e c o n d c o l u m n o n its first
a p p e a r a n c e also dealt with
beer but, unlike Profile,
alcohol w a s to be Ihe
subject matter for all
o f its issues. 'The
D r i n k i n g M a n ' s
G u i d e t o L o n d o n '
was exactly what y o u
w o u l d expect; a p u b
w a s r e v i e w e d every
w e e k w h e r e a y o u n g
m a n m a y m o p his fevered
b r o w a n d rest his tired feet,
relaxing over a pint o f ale. A n d h o w
m u c h d i d it cost? Well, t h e first p u b
included w a s T h e Windsor Castle' (off
Kensington Church Street), w h e r e o n e
could purchase a pint of Cherringtons I PA
for o n e eigth o f a p e n c e or, for t h o s e
w h o want to g o a bit more upmarket, the
mild a n d bitter for o n e quarter o f a
p e n c e .
The rest o f I elix w a s m a d e up o f
sports a n d club reports, occasional news
articles, a n d literary writing, mostly witty
poetry. T h e editorials always m a d e it
quite clear that Felix w o u l d not answer to
a n y o n e a n d w o u l d v o i c e its o p i n i o n
loudly. T h e insular nature o f the Felix
Editorial t e a m m a d e it easy to maintain
editorial control a n d political direction,
s o m e t h i n g that t h e advent of U n i o n sub-
sidies a n d ICU Club regulations w e r e to
erode. At t h e s a m e time it w a s unmis-
takingly, u n a s h a m e d l y and appalingiy an
extension of t h e '21', '22', 'Chaps' a n d
'Links' Drinking C l u b s into journalism.
Still, g o o d things c o m e from small begin-
nings...
From Beer to Broadsheet
W e have h a d s o m e f e e d b a c k from the
previous 'Fifty Years O n ' c o l u m n , includ-
ing input o n the origin of the n a m e Felix.
A l l o w m e to q u o t e extracts o f a letter I
recently r e c e i v e d f r o m A n t h o n y d c
Reuck, a Physics student from 1947-51,
w h o w a s a n editor o f Phoenix a n d writer
for Felix.
"The familiar n a m e used by t h e inti-
mates in t h e Links Club o f t h e F o u n d i n g
Father o f Felix, that is to say Ted Hughes,
was 'Felix'. Felix H u g h e s , debonair, with
a dry wit a n d a satirical cast o f mind, w a s
a G u i l d s m a n a n d a Mechanical Engineer.
H e w o u l d n o t h a v e a p p l i e d his o w n

nant g e n u f l e x i o n to its ancient cousin
Phoenix." (full letter o n letters page 6).
