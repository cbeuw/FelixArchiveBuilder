VARIOUS ARTISTS TRASHMONK
Little Voice - OST
Surprisingly enough Jane Horrocks
has more than Just a little voice.
L
ittle V o i c e , p l a y e d by J a n e
Horrocks (best k n o w n for her
role as B u b b l e s in A b s o l u t e l y
fabulous), is t h e story o f a y o u n g girl
w h o , in o v e r c o m i n g her shyness, has
learnt to imitate various artists f r o m her
record collection. The film follows her
discovery, rise a n d c o n s e q u e n t
exploitation. T h e film features w e l l
k n o w n s o n g s by legendary actresses
a n d singers s u c h as Judy G a r l a n d ,
Marilyn M o n r o e a n d Shirley Bassey,
alongside those s u n g by Horrocks as
tittle Voice.
Horrocks' mimicry of t h e M o n r o e
s o u n d a n d style is extremely realistic
a n d at times, a t o u c h u n c a n n y while
p o u t i n g her w a y through / Wanna Be
Loved By You. H o w e v e r , w h e n c o m -
pared to t h e real thing, her voice lacks
the d e p t h a n d p o w e r of the others, but
the similarities m e a n that her s o n g s d o
not s o u n d t o o out o f place. T o m Jones
is t h e token male artist featured with It's
Not Unusual, w h i c h a l t h o u g h cheesy
a n d classy in its o w n right, d o e s s o u n d
inferior o n a soundtrack o f this calibre.
The purpose o f a soundtrack is to
c o m p l i m e n t t h e film, but d u e to t h e
e x c l u s i o n o f t h e i n s t r u m e n t a l back-
g r o u n d bits, w h i c h are the usual s o u n d -
track fodder, this soundtrack also stands
alone as a collection o f s o m e really g o o d
music. However, as with all films w h e n
music f r o m t h e soundtrack is featured,
it tends to be in snippets and/or p u s h e d
very m u c h to the b a c k g r o u n d -1 h o p e
that this film d o e s t h e music justice. In
c o n c l u s i o n , it's not your average stu-
dent buy, m o r e that of a n older relative-
but nevertheless very g o o d i n d e e d .

T
r a s h m o n k is Nick Laird-Clowes.
A collaborator with n u m e r o u s
respected artists; he h a d an
affair with Kelly Le Brock; lost his vir-
ginity at 14 to a 27 year o l d m o d e l at
John Lennon's house; a n d he has that
all important popstar k n o w l e d g e o f
s p e e d , coke, ecstasy, k c t a m i n e a n d
cuttlefish, a n d to t o p il all off he had a
non-too-pleasant e x p e r i e n c e in a
M i d d l e Last prison.
Thus, by m y reckoning all this puts
T r a s h m o n k in his Iate30's/early 40's,
but fear not this is not an exercise in
Dadrock. H e describes himself as B o b
Dylan with samplers or Elliot Smith pro-
d u c e d by the Beastie Boys. A n d indeed
Mona Lisa Overdrive is m o r e akin to
Beck than t h e bland offerings of t h e
Wellers o f this world. That isn't to say
there are n o e c h o e s o f yesteryear; Sap-
phire and Dying Day have t h e poignant
delicacy o f Nick Drake a n d All Change
is Alex Chilton wilh tabla.
Loss o f the self a n d o f other selves
are c o m m o n t h e m e s but t h e m e s s a g e
is positive. It's b e e n a rocky ride but
worth it nonetheless w h e n the desti-
nation s o u n d s this g o o d . El Chris

If, o n t h e other h a n d y o u have a n

s e e m s a stupid thing to say, but if y o u
like this kind o f stuff t h e n y o u ' r e g o i n g

only a n acoustic guitarist's c o p y b o o k -
and a lazy, dreamy, if-it-were-any-more-
laid-back-it'd-fall-over o n e at that - it's a
collection o f aural w a t e r c o l o u r s , a
s o u n d collage o f C h i c a g o , t h e West
Coast, C u b a a n d t h e Caribbean that
couldn't hurry if it tried. Listening to Jim
O'Rourke's latest release is t h e musical

m e l o d i o u s , crisp a n d assured finger-
picked guitar, s h i m m e r i n g piano a n d
m o r e different kinds o f percussion a n d
brass than y o u can shake a stick at.
Crosby, Stills a n d Nash fans will recog-

m o n i s e d vocals that sparingly grace t h e
a l b u m , at a h u n d r e d yards a n d smile
with t h e pleasure o f reacquainting o n e -

A
collection o f o l d single a n d
a l b u m material f r o m
C h u m b a w a m b a . Y o u have to
question the merits o f this collection,
but I guess it's an act o f desperation.
A n d desperate this a l b u m is!
I tried very hard to listen to this all
the way, but I have to admit that I failed.
It is truly terrible, a n d as for their musi-
cal abilities, see t h e first paragraph.
Take for example, Morality Play In
Three Acts, w h e r e t h e g u y is s i n g i n g
s o m e crap lyrics. N o , I take that back,
singing is t o o g o o d a w o r d to describe
his incoherent talk. The music, also, has
b e e n very cunningly disguised as crappy
noise. Hanging On The Old Barbed Wire
is worse. For crying out loud, an acap-
pella s h o u l d only be d o n e by p e o p l e
with g o o d voices.
I w a s really h o p i n g to b e able to say
that t h e a l b u m is not all that b a d , but I
w o u l d have to lie. I w o u l d have loved t o
offer m o n e y to s o m e o n e to take this off
m e , but I had to destroy it -1 w o u l d n ' t
be able to live with the guilt o f corrupt-
ing healthy ears. For those w h o still feel
the n e e d to hear this for themselves I
w o u l d n ' t suggest y o u try in a n y rep-
utable m u s i c store s u c h as H M V or
Tower - they k n o w better. El Asad

Pras - Whal'cha Wanna Do
As typical with Pras, there are many
guest artists on this, together creating a
very soulful sound. This is also taken
from the Ghetto Supastar album and
makes you wonder really - how many
tracks are left on the album? - I don't
know, It Just seems like so many from
the one album.
