lock vote. Wait, no. Chinese granite.
No, that's wrong. M y apologies. It
seems I've forgotten h o w to write
this column. W o m e n . Yes, I think it's c o m -
ing back to m e . Misery. Despair. By Jove.
Got it.
Hello to o n e a n d all. I'm sure y o u
won't be w o n d e r i n g w h y I haven't graced
these pages for a while. W h y the miracu-
lous return? Study this question further, a n d
ask, w h y did I write the article at the begin-
ning o f term? A m I really that good? N o .
Shucks. It w a s because o u r editor, Ed
"Nicholson" Sexton (nice o n e , Gulix) has
begun to think along similar lines to the
previous editor, o n e Jeremy "WinNuke"
Thomson, in realising the following, very
important premise: this c o l u m n never,
ever needs proofreading. [Smug noises]
Seriously, though, y o u will have noticed
that a couple o f last term's columnists
have bailed out of the old writing lark, at
least temporarily. It just goes to s h o w that
this job is not as easy as y o u might think.
It's not all smoked salmon and champagne
with M r Caldwell, you know. It's staying up
until six in the m o r n i n g d o i n g yet another
frigging election special. (There's also quite
a bit o f l u g g i n g fridges
about, for s o m e reason.) So
b e f o r e y o u write in with
your gripes a n d moans, consider that the
cat is only h u m a n . I w o u l d also like you to
bear this in mind next time
I write s o m e t h i n g crap. Or
make a spelling mistake.
I w a s looking through
old Felixes, a n d , boy, did I
write s o m e drivel s o m e -
times. This time last year I
wrote s o m e t h i n g about flat
hunting. (I remember some-
o n e in m y d e p a r t m e n t
c o m p l e m e n t i n g m e o n the
piece. Believe m e , I w a s as
surprised as y o u are now. I
wrote it in twenty minutes.
It w a s shambolic.) I was sit-
ting in the computer room,
thinking about this, and lis-
tening to t w o first-years dis-
cussing living plans for next
year, w h e n I realised s o m e -
thing that I didn't k n o w w h e n I wrote the
original article. Not all first-years are g o i n g
to get re-app places. Not all will get con-

venient (but very cold) flats
in South K e n s i n g t o n .
Some, maybe even most,
will be stuck in cheaper residences; houses
further out. Here's the point: don't be dis-
c o n c e r t e d if your living
plans culminate in l o n g
and expensive treks across
London. Picking a cheap
flat c a n m e a n getting a
lounge, a n d getting single
rooms. Best of all, you're
no longer a student; you're
an inhabitant of London.
Exposing yourself to a dif-
ferent cross-section of soci-
ety is refreshing after being
stuck in t h e r o o m next to
the Resident Linstead Acid
Techno Freak. Plus you can
have parties.
We had s o m e sabbat-
ical elections, didn't w e ?
What d o y o u m e a n , y o u
don't know? I spent a g o o d
hour laying out those interviews so you lot
could be well-informed. Pah. Don't want to
dwell o n it, dear boy, you know, but it w a s
truly delightful \o s e e so many candidates
standing. Lovely. Bit more competition for
the old Telix w o u l d have b e e n nice, you
know, old fellow, b u t never mind. O h ,
that w a s ghastly batting... Hick is bowled
by a frightful g o o g l y I can't believe they
didn't pick Hussain... it's absolutely atro-
cious... N o , wait. Sorry.
Actually, staying up until s o m e ungodly
hour to wait for t h e election results was-
n't so b a d - bored with arranging barber-
shop harmonies of "Why Are W e Waiting?",
myself and Dennis "drum fill" Patrickson did
a cracking d r u n k e n rendition o f Oasis'
Supersonic. All together now: "...make me
laugh..." W h e n it's all said a n d d o n e ,
though, the election has given birth to
interesting sweepstake opportunities. Will
Tasha g o the Andy Heeps route? [201 ] Will
half the sabbs elect fail their years? [6-1 ] Will
DP t&W, the newest sabb, be given the
smallest office? [2-1 ]. Will the portakabins
containing the f elix office next year be very
cruddy indeed? [Yes.]
It pains m e to d o it, but I'm g o i n g to
have to leave y o u now. For s o m e reason,
the editor wants m e to move his fridges
around again.
