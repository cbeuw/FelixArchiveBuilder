Clayponds' Village Hall
This week, I have only o n e thing to say to
Sherfield - take Simon Baker's advice, a n d
stop rejecting small a n d unfashionable
projects o n the grounds o f saving funds.
Build the Clayponds Village Hall this s u m -
mer.
"Ah-ha!" I hear y o u s m u g C o l l e g e
Committee goers say, "It doesn't w o r k
like that! Every year w e s p e n d all t h e res-
idences' m o n e y o n m o r e important pro-
jects, such as making sure current halls are
safe, pleasant, and not about to fall d o w n .
You wouldn't want us to neglect student
safety for t h e sake o f a c o m m o n r o o m ,
would you?" O f course not. The answer is
simple - give the residences pot s o m e
more cash. W e are talking 3 % o f the boat
house's cost; less than half a percent o f
the BMS' bill. Sell off s o m e o f the excess
granite from the flowerbeds, reduce s o m e
of the six figure salaries in Sherfield by a
few percent, a n d you're half w a y there.
Don't like that idea? O h , I a m surprised...
At the e n d o f the day t h e p r o b l e m is
Clayponds' location. It isn't a fashionable
project, It isn't extravagant or likely to be
recognised as a great construction
achievement. W h e n t h e m a n or w o m a n
w h o has blocked the hall's erection looks
out o f their Level 5 w i n d o w in Sherfield,
they will not s e e a great glass t o w e r
gleaming in the sunlight. I don't k n o w
w h o that m a n or w o m a n is, or possibly
m e n or w o m e n , but I think t h e residents

of Clayponds w o u l d like to know. A n y o n e
w h o wants to tell m e w h o the culprits are
over a quiet pint, I'm buying.
As for the suggestion of paying for it
with increased rent... I'm not sure. 90p a
w e e k is, what, about £30 a year? It isn't a
lot o f money, a n d if t h e students are
happy to pay it, then I say g o ahead a n d
let's get t h e d a m n thing built. W e can
argue about the ethics afterwards. A n d
argument there should be; charging res-
idents for n e w hall facilities sets a dan-
gerous precedent. H o w long before such
a m o v e leads to students being charged
for essentia! but unexpected work, rather
than 'non-vital' projects such as that at
Clayponds?
A Nice Word for Mr Caldwell
Have I lost my journalistic cynicism, I hear
you cry? No, in fact it increases with every
issue, but I a m a reasonable m a n . M r
Caldwell e m a i l e d m e a letter late last
Wednesday, which I a s s u m e d w a s not
for publication given its informal tone.
M r Caldwell w o u l d like to point out
that it is not Estates' fault that the college
has difficulty getting planning permission
for projects. H e w o u l d like to remind stu-
dents that activities that piss off our neigh-
bours, many o f w h o m are influential o n
the local council, are likely to jeopardise
future college building plans, a n d thus
w a s t e c o l l e g e m o n e y . M r Caldwell

describes himself as " y o u n g at heart",
a n d states that h e "supports students
enjoying themselves", but also believes
several hundred thousand pounds of plan-
ning fees have been lost d u e to antisocial
behaviour from IC (or other) students. I
w o u l d like to a d d that Ian Caldwell w a s
very helpful w h e n questioned about the
Clayponds Village t lall. There you go, Ian
- what other editor, apart from maybe
J o a n n a Lillcy, w o u l d devote s o m u c h
space in an editorial to you? M a y b e I a m
losing m y cynicism...
You Are All Drug Addicts!
...I'll tell you a thought I had during a par-
ticularly exciting neurology lecture last
year. People argue endlessly a b o u t
w h e t h e r certain drugs a r c harmless,
whether they affect your cognition, etc
etc. Well, excuse m e , but the h o r m o n e s
and neurotransmitters that alter and, yes,
occasionally harm your mental make-up
arc just as powerful as any 'artificial' drug.
Like it or not, y o u s e e the world through
an ocean of powerful chemicals that con-
stantly c h a n g e h o w y o u perceive a n d
respond to the outside world.
As for the drugs argument? I'm rapidly
c o m i n g to the conclusion that p e o p l e
w h o have not taken a certain drug can
never argue effectively with those w h o
have experienced it, simply because the
two groups start from different premises,
reflecting t h e c h a n g e in attitude that
inevitably results from drug use.
Anyway, there's a pro-legalisation
march in London o n M a y 1 (assuming the
organisers aren't too stoned to hold it),
and I daresay I'll s e e a g o o d f e w o f y o u
there.
A Word of Warning
There w a s a time, n o l m u c h more than a
d e c a d e a g o , w h e n Union hacks o f any
description w e r e n o l allowed in the Felix
Office, a n d Felix club m e m b e r s w e r e
v i e w e d with suspicion in the confines o f
the Union. In recent years this dividing line
has w i t h e r e d away, a n d m a n y o f y o u
have probably noticed that I a m more 'pro
U n i o n ' than m y predecessor. I have even
b e e n called Dave Hellard's lap-dog, and
the voice o f the Union, by s o m e students.
Well, it m a y not last. The U n i o n has
b e e n g o o d this year, with a g o o d sabb
team, a n d has generally acted in a way
that I feel has directly benefited the stu-
dents of this college (which is m y over-rid-
ing concern). I here arc things in t h e
pipeline, however...
So, master Hcllard a n d others, I'm
sorry if I offend any of you in the next four
m o n t h s - please r e m e m b e r to separate
professional criticism from personal prej-
udices. A n d if a n y o n e feels they have
b e e n treated badly by ICU or college;
Felix is your i n d e p e n d e n t voice. - Ed
