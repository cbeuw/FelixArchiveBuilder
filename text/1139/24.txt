Beverley Knight
Interview
This week we meet up with the origi-
nal British Soul Sista, the R&B Queen of
England!
Beverley Knight is o n e of the friendliest
people I have ever had the fortune to
talk to, she's a lovely girl w h o m a d e
m e feel like I've b e e n talking to her for
years. With a n e w remix o f ' M a d e it
Back' b l o w i n g u p all over again a n d her
a l b u m getting a re-release I w o n d e r e d
h o w s o m e o n e with so m u c h g o i n g for
t h e m could have there feet planted so
firmly o n the g r o u n d . Probably s o m e -
thing to d o with her up bringing, she
was a g o s p e l singer a n d had never
s u n g outside of church until she left
h o m e for college. O n c e she started
singing in clubs, as the support for oth-
ers, there w a s n o l o o k i n g back, she
was spotted s o o n a n d didn't look back.
Beverley first blew up way back in 1995
w h e n she released a record that has
g o n e o n to b e c o m e o n e o f the hottest
British R&B tunes of all time 'flavour of
the O l d School'. It w a s massive in the
clubs a n d w a s quickly f o l l o w e d by her
debut a l b u m 'The B-Funk1
, this e a r n e d
praise from all quarters, but especially
from the R&B heads. Beverley Knight
had arrived a n d was getting recogni-
tion as the best British soul prospect
for years, f o l l o w up singles ' D o w n for
the O n e ' a n d the
.wicked ' M o v i n '
O n Up O n The
Right Side' did
nothing but
increase the
respect for her. In
1996 she w o n the
prestigious Black
M u s i c A w a r d for
best R&B artist
and was well o n e
her way to d o m i -
nating the R&B
charts, but she
didn't! Beverley
just disappeared
and for two years
nothing was heard f r o m her, until the
s u m m e r of 1998 w h e n she released
the s t u p e n d o u s ' M a d e It Back' as the
lead single of her s e c o n d set 'Prodigal
Sista', Bev w a s back a n d back exactly
w h e r e she left of.
Beverley's 'Prodigal Sista' a l b u m got
great reviews o n its initial release in
the s u m m e r (we called it the best
British a l b u m of the year), but is n o w
getting a re-packaging a n d a re-
release, I w h e n over a n d asked the
diva why?
M i l e n : W h e n 'Prodigal Sista' was first
released it got great reviews, so w h y
are y o u re-releasing it? W e r e y o u
u n h a p p y with it first time round?
Beverley K n i g h t : N o , not at all, the first
time the a l b u m was h o w I want it, it
was my a l b u m , its contents w e r e per-
fect.
M : That's my point, to us and to nuff
p e o p l e w h o b o u g h t it, it was per-
fect so w h y the re-release?
BK : The a l b u m sold well, it sold to p e o -
ple w h o buy R&B a n d basically what w e
w a n t to d o with the re-release is to
m a k e m o r e p e o p l e m o r e aware of Bev-
erley Knight, use It as a way of getting
m e into the m i n d s of the public of
large.
M : So w h a t is the n e w a l b u m g o n n a
have o n it that the old o n e didn't?
BK : Its basically the same, the n e w set
has a f e w remixes a n d re-workings o n
It a n d is m o r e of a vehicle to get o n to
radio a n d get a large share of the mar-
ket, w h i l e maintaining my s o u n d .
M : The n e w ' M a d e It Back' remix,
w h e r e did that c o m e
from? There's this
story that s o m e o n e
did it, pressed it to
white label, y o u
heard it and liked it.
B K S o m e t h i n g like
that, but not quite. A
DJ m e s s e d about
I with the original, like
they do, a n d c a m e
. up with this mix, h e
I sent a tape to the
:• . . •
•
. record c o m p a n y and
' man's d e s k , h e
p l a u t l loi me and
yeah I liked it. The
c o m p a n y d e c i d e d it w o u l d be g o o d
i d e a to release the single a n d g o for a
wider a u d i e n c e , a n d from there w e
d e c i d e d o n the re-release of the w h o l e
a l b u m .
M : What h a p p e n e d in those years
b e t w e e n the first a n d s e c o n d albums, I
Devil's Pie by D'Angelo
k n o w y o u c h a n g e d record c o m p a n y ,
but w h y such l o n g gap?
BK: Well, it was c h a n g i n g c o m p a n y
that t o o k so long, I w a s s i g n e d to a
contract with D o m e Records a n d I
w a n t e d out, things d r a g g e d out, but
o n c e finished I l o o k e d at record c o m -
panies to sign for a n d eventually
signed for EMI. Things take as l o n g as
they take.
M : Why did y o u split with D o m e ?
BK : I or legal reasons I can't go into to
details, but they had o n e o p i n i o n o f
w h e r e my career s h o u l d be a l a n d I
h a d a totally different o p i n i o n . It w a s
all about the direction of my s o u n d
a n d D o m e weren't o n the s a m e wave-
length as m e .
M : What did Ihey want?
BK : Well, Ihey w e r e l o o k i n g to m a k e a
sort of m a n u f a c t u r e d s o u n d that was-
n't w h a t I w a n t e d .
M : Why did y o u c h o o s e EMI?
BK : I l o o k e d hard al all the c o m p a n i e s
a n d EMI w e r e the most attractive for
m e . I k n o w they have a bil of a rep for
b e i n g an indie label, but they are an
artist driven label. They have real
artists, they w e r e willing to give m e the
control over my o w n m u s i c a n d my
career.
M : Its well k n o w n that as a kid y o u
s a n g g o s p e l , w h y didn't y o u g o into
that?
BK: M y parents w a n t e d m e to sing
gospel, but there c a m e a point w h e r e I
had to d e c i d e w h i c h w a y I w a n t e d to
g o a n d I d e c i d e d u p o n the big w i d e
w o r l d o f R&B.
M : W e r e your parents disappointed?
BK : O f course they were, but they did-
n't stop m e , they s u p p o r t e d my deci-
sion a n d let m e get o n with it.
At the e n d of the day Beverly Knight is
a classy i n d e p e n d e n t lady w h o has
massive a m o u n t s o f talent. She has
always m o v e d in a direction that she
wants to g o in, a n d that has always
b e e n o n e that the rest of us have
loved. 'Prodigal Sista' is re-released in
April a n d the remix of ' M a d e it Back' is
out o n M a r c h 22. This girl deserves
h u g e success a n d hopefully she will
get it.
