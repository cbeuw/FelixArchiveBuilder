Seven Year Wait For Clayponds Over?
After a wait of over five years, it seems that
the residents of Clayponds Hall may finally
get a Village Hall. Currently the hall has no
c o m m o n social area, and the construction
of a separate building to house a c o m m o n
room has been rejected by college in pre-
vious years. However, It seems that the hall
will be built only if residents agree to a sur-
charge being added to their rent to cover
the cost.
Clayponds is a c o m m u n i t y o f over
three hundred students, both undergrad-
uates and postgraduates, consisting o f
flats within several houses. The entire site
was a residential development that was
bought by the college part way through its
construction, and has since b e e n turned
into what is inappropriately called a vil-
lage. Inappropriately because Clayponds
has never had any social area or c o m m o n
room; Joanne Christer, a s u b w a r d e n at
Clayponds, described the TV r o o m as " a
garage with a f e w seats in it".
Thus in 1992 the then n e w warden,
By Ed Sexton
Danny Segal (who was unavailable at the
time of writing), started a project to get a
'village hall' built for Clayponds. According
to Jason Bain, w h o has lived at Clayponds
for over five years, "there arc many people
in college, for whatever reason, don't want
the c o m m o n room built." Certainly little
progress has been m a d e in that time - the
project has been discussed in college com-
mittees, such as the wardens' sub-com-
mittee a n d the Rector's Committee o n
Student Residences, proposals have been
put forward, and the matter has then been
quietly forgotten about. As current warden
MarkTyrer put it, "everybody thought it was
a g o o d idea, but n o t h i n g h a p p e n e d " .
Apparently some members of college have
suggested that not all the students at Clay-
ponds want the hall to be built, an accu-
sation that student representatives deny.
O n e senior student at the hall c o m m e n t e d
"there seems to be a general feeling that
the Estates people are pretty apathetic
towards us, viewing us as out of sight, out
of mind."
Accrodingto Ian Caldwell, the Director
of Estates, the proposed building w o u l d
cost n o m o r e than Â£75,000 - a small
amount w h e n compared to other college
projects. As the building is part of a resi-
dence, however, it w o u l d have to b e
funded from the residences account. This
is the crux of the problem - every year
these funds have been allocated to pro-
jects d e e m e d to b e m o r e important.
Indeed, Mark Tyrer was told by college
that "there isn't the funds available". M r
Caldwell did say, however, that he "could
see the students' view", stoically stating "I
build what I'm told to build".
The latest plan appears to be to add
90p onto Claypond's weekly rent for the
next five years, w h i c h w o u l d cover the
cost of the hall. This proposal has had a
mixed reception. According to M s Christer
the students "arc perfectly willing to do it,
as long as it has what they want in it." Many
object to the move o n principle, with one
warden describing as a "rather ugly prece-
dent". M r Bain described the proposal as
"ridiculous", stating "the residents at Clay-
ponds should not be singled out to pay for
Ihis facility." He went on to explain that "the
situation with the c o m m o n room is o n e of
many factors w h i c h has lead m e to resign
from the position o f Assistant Warden."
David Hellard has m a d e clear his opinion
is similar; "I can't believe College can be so
petty". There is a glimmer of hope for Clay-
ponds, however; M r Caldwell cautiously
stated that there "might be the potential to
find s o m e funding from s o m e w h e r e else
I other than students' rent]". Mark lyrer
s u m m e d up the current situation succinctly,-
"there is n o reason w h y it couldn't be built
this summer."

IC School o f M e d i c i n e have o n c e again
confirmed their place as o n e of the top stu-
dent rugby sides in the country, after win-
ning the prestigious U H C u p for a second
successive year.
A final scorellne of 21-12 over fellow
newcomers GKT (formerly Guys. Kings and
Thomas' M e d i c a l Schools; n o w part o f
Kings College) was the m i n i m u m the team
deserved after a performance which, in
truth, was superior to the opposition in
almost every department. In particular,
ICSM's set-piece play saw them pressurisng
GKT at every oppourtunity, thanks to utter
domination in the line-out and fine w o r k
with the boot from Ian M a c l e o d at full-
back.
A n early penalty from ICSM was fol-
lowed u p with fifteen m i n u t e s d u r i n g
which the ball never s e e m e d t o leave
GKT's 22. This non-stop pressure had to pay
off, and eventually a well w o r k e d back-
move rolled off a lineout and saw the ball
put d o w n between the posts. The con-
version, c o u p l e d with a penalty w h i c h
resulted from relentless ICSM pressure put

the score up to 13-0. Attempting to fight
back, GKT momcntarilly moved out of their
half, but g o o d cover work coupled with
decisive kicking saw off the threat, and
another M a c l e o d penalty on the stroke of
half-time pushed the lead oul to sixteen
points.
After the interval, both teams c a m e
out l o o k i n g to play a m o r e expansive
game, which saw the ball rush from o n e
end of the pitch to the other. Eventually,
however, lapses in concentration coupled
with a few missed tackles saw GKT charge
down the field to notch up their first try and
narrow the gap to eleven points, this sud-
den impetus produced an immediate shot
of adrenaline to GKT, w h o came alive with
a burst o f powerful play. A penalty try,
awarded for "repeated infringements" was
their reward, and the gap b e c a m e just
four points. But, with the lension n o w run-
ning incredibly high, ICSM's superiority
shone through. A brilliant period o f play
saw the ball pass through the hands of vir-
tually every back, before finally b e i n g
touched d o w n in the corner, the crowd
went wild and poured onto the pitch; with
ICSM nine points in the lead and less lhan
five minutes to play, the result was n o
longer in doubt. The g a m e resumed, but
a couple of minutes later the referee blew
for time, and ICSM Captain Ben Carpenter
stepped up to collect the historic trophy.
