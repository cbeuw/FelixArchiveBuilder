Sasha and John Digweed
Northern Exposure 3
'Expeditions'
John D i g w e e d a n d Sasha are t h e
most celebrated m e m b e r s o f their pro-
fession, being both innovative a n d enter-
taining. They have the ability to create a
great a t m o s p h e r e u s i n g b r e a t h t a k i n g
tunes, a n d in recent years they have
enjoyed h u g e success with t h e s u p e r b
Northern Exposure series (and b e f o r e
that the incredible Renaissance projects).
The collaboration b e t w e e n the t w o mas-
ters continues with the n e w Northern
Exposure a l b u m entitled 'Expeditions.'
This is a n a l b u m w h i c h is simply brilliant.
Digweed a n d Sasha have always s e e n
themselves as different to all t h e other
DJs, a n d this a l b u m takes t h e m back to
the formidable style that h e l p e d t h e m
make their n a m e s - g o o d quality, d e e p
progressive h o u s e music. T h e track list-
ing uses the full spectrum o f old and n e w
spiritual progressive music, across t w o
CDs. Tracks include D i g w e e d ' s remix o f
Danny Tenaglia's 'Turn M e O n ' a n d
Sasha's o w n 'Belfunk'. T h e a l b u m has
b e e n c o m p i l e d behind i h e decks before
refining w o r k in t h e studio to create
additional effects. This is a great a l b u m ,
a n d if y o u like t h e d e e p music of Dig-
w e e d a n d Sasha you'd b e a fool not to
buy it.

M o r c e a n Worker
' M i x e d Emotional Features LP'
This a l b u m , produced by A d a m Dorn
( M o r c e a n Worker) has to b e o n e of the
best D&B a l b u m s thai has ever b e e n
created. It's so g o o d that had it not b e e n
for Sasha a n d D i g w e e d , this w o u l d have
b e e n a l b u m of the w e e k . 'Mixed Emo-
tional features LP1
is a ten track a l b u m
that uses m a n y different types o f music,
w h i c h are then expertly fused with D&B.
The best thing about t h e a l b u m is that
there are n o M C s at all, so there's n o irri-
tating vocals. T h e tracks feature music
such as house, funk, jazz, progressive
a n d s o m e g o o d old "normal" D&B; each
tune slowly builds u p , starting gently
b e f o r e hitting y o u with D & B s o u n d s
w h i c h then gradually fade into the calm
finale. This is a n a l b u m that is meant for
p e o p l e w h o like all kinds of music - a
superb collection o f tunes.

Astral Projection
'Another World'
(Transient)
This is the sixth a l b u m from the finest
Israeli trance act ever (personally I k n o w
of n o other Israeli trance acts but w h o ' s
counting?). A nine-track a l b u m , 'Another
World' is trance music at its best - s o
m u c h so that,DJs such as Danny Ram-
pling have g i v e n the tracks g l o w i n g
reports. The music is very m u c h like that
released o n t h e Perfecto label - fast
beats, hard bass lines, lots of pianos/
syths and, o f course, plenty o f break-
downs. A n d because it's g o o d quality fast
trance it's great to dance to. Astral Pro-
jection, the true originators of psytrance,
will s o o n b e touring in L o n d o n to help
p r o m o t e t h e a l b u m a n d if y o u w a n t
more info, then p o p into the Felix office.

'City B o y Players'
this is o n e hell o f a n a l b u m - a lot of
variety and great tunes, the only problem
is t h e a l b u m is not l o n g e n o u g h ! ! This

Detroit, y o u w o u l d have expected it to be

G u r m
Gus Gus @ ULU
Last Friday, Joel a n d I ( a n d m y flat
mate w h o r a n d o m l y turned up) braved
the pissing rain to g o a n d s e e Iceland's
finest (but most under-rated) b a n d G u s
Gus at U L U . Having never b e e n to U L U
before I w a s surprised at h o w small t h e
v e n u e was, but within a n hour the place
was packed a n d I w a s glad I h a d left m y
crutches at h o m e (after last w e e k ' s farce
at Turnmills there was no way I w a s bring-
ing them), for the first hour and a half w e
were treated to a warm-up j o c k w h o
played great h o u s e m u s i c - both pro-
gressive a n d hard, but I felt a bit sorry for
him as no-one s e e m e d to notice h i m .
Gradually the clock a p p r o a c h e d 9:30pm
and t h e a t m o s p h e r e built u p in antici-
pation o f G u s Gus. A n d then they c a m e
on stage to a standing ovation (okay I'll
admit there w e r e n ' t a n y seats), a n d
immediately G u s G u s (six guys a n d a
girl) took us through a trip o f great music.
It's hard to d e f i n e t h e m u s i c they pro-
d u c e s i n c e it e n c o m p a s s e s t e c h n o ,
dance, indie, h o u s e - all sorts, the c r o w d
was treated to a great mix o f tunes.
The tunes w e r e mostly recent stuff
but there w e r e a f e w classics d r o p p e d in
there, including t h e f a b u l o u s 'Believe'
which w e n t d o w n a storm. T h e a t m o s -
phere was intense a n d G u s Gus, playing
their first U K gig for over a year, j o i n e d
the crowd, in j u m p i n g u p a n d d o w n , a n d
madly w a v i n g their hands in t h e air dur-
ing t h e harder tracks, whilst t h e c o u p l e
of soft s o n g s s a w t h e c r o w d swaying
gently as t h e lights d i m m e d .
Tosser o f the night had to g o l o the
bloke d a n c i n g in front o f poor old Joel.
Having only grabbed a f e w hours sleep
in t h e last thirty hours or so, Joel ( w h o
could barely stay awake) spent the g i g
d a n c i n g b e h i n d a bloke w h o not only
had t h e worst haircut in t h e world, but
w h o also t o o k great pleasure in shoving
the frizzy mass into Joel's face - until Joel
kicked u p a fuss, w h e n h e promptly tied
up his hair u s i n g his girlfriend's bobble.
Still, lhat didn't stop us from shoving him
in the back c v c r y t i m e h e s t e p p e d back-
wards.
Back o n stage, a n d G u s G u s w e r e
s c r e a m i n g out the lyrics over the t h u m p -
ing bass lines, a n d w h e n o n e o f t h e
guys started s i n g i n g in a M a u r i c e Gibb
voice w e started w o n d e r i n g If this was a
tribute to t h e B e e G e e s . T h e s h o w cul-
minated w h e n the lead singer asked " D o
y o u w a n n a hear techno?" to t h e c r o w d .
Naturally w e s h o u t e d that w e w o u l d a n d
Gus G u s promptly blared out a fabulous
t e c h n o track with hard bass lines a n d
m i n i m a l vocals b e f o r e l a u n c h i n g into
l a d y s h a v e ' , their latest single. All
t h r o u g h o u t t h e gig, weird images a n d
m e s s a g e s w e r e projected o n t o a screen
b e h i n d t h e stage a d d i n g to a n already
electric a t m o s p h e r e .
A n hour a n d half later it sadly fin-
ished - G u s G u s c a m e o n for a n encore
a n d then left t h e c r o w d to mull about
until the lead singer c a m e out a n d said
"No guys, it's finished....cheers". This
was a great g i g a n d Felix has to thank
Justin at 4 A D records for letting us c o m e
a n d review a f a b u l o u s night.
G u s G u s - Scandinavian a n d Strange, n o w there's a surprise!
