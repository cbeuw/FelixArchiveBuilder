Imperial white-wash Brunei!
ICI 38
Brunei III 14
Having beaten St. G e o r g e s in the s e c o n d
round of t h e Gutteridge cup, t h e IC 1st
XV d e c i d e d to play a w a r m u p g a m e
against Brunei 3rd XV.
The g a m e started with Brunei p u s h -
ing Imperial back to their line. A terrible
line o u t t h r o w from o u r h o o k e r Dave
Pearce put t h e m to within scoring range.
But Imperial w a s having n o n e o f it a n d
held fast. T h e break c a m e with Brunei
c o n c e d i n g a penalty for dirty play In t h e
ruck, a n d Dave H o g g b o o t i n g t h e ball
d e e p into their half.
f r o m then, Imperial started t o really
put pressure o n Brunei. O u t rucking
t h e m in t h e forwards a n d o u t playing
t h e m in t h e backs, they really didn't s e e
m u c h ball. It wasn't l o n g b e f o r e Dave o
Gol cut through the d e f e n c e to score the
first points for IC.
IC thought that Brunei, having c o n -
ceded a score, w o u l d c o m e back with all
cannons firing. But they just didn't s e e m
to c o m p a r e at all with o u r fast p a c e d
game, a n d it w a s only a f e w minutes
later w h e n Matt "I'm t o o fat" C o c k a y n e
took t h e ball o n himself a n d f l o p p e d
over t h e line to score a s e c o n d try.
Imperial, really b e g i n n i n g to enjoy
the g a m e , started to let loose a n d spent
the remainder of t h e first half c a m p e d
near their line. M o r e tries w e r e scored
by w i n g e r A n d y M a y e s a n d the scrum
half Gabriel O d e d i r a n .
However, all w a s not well. Brunei,
realising that the g a m e w a s n o w in their
reach, started to play dirty and took every
o p p o r t u n i t y t o s t a m p o n o u r boys.
Injuries started to occur a n d early in t h e
s e c o n d half saw Kaizen g o i n g off having
b e e n k n e e ' d in the h e a d a n d generally
s t a m p e d all over. In t h e face of this,
Imperial momentarily wavered, allowing
t h e m to push over for their first points.
But IC w a s still out playing them a n d
Charlie " w i n d m e u p a n d I start to g o "
C u n n e l p a c e d it d o w n t h e t o u c h line to
put Ic further in t h e lead.
Brunei h a d by n o w given u p a n y
h o p e o f w i n n i n g and w e r e concentrating
their efforts o n hurting our people. They
e v e n d e c i d e d to b e sportsmanlike a n d
brought o n half o f their s e c o n d t e a m to
try a n d force things their way.
There's only o n e thing left to say; w e
thrashed ' e m !

ICII...
SS/S..
In t h e N e w Year IC II have b e e n having
a nightmare. We've w o n only 2 o u t o f
6 league g a m e s a n d b e e n k n o c k e d o u t
of t h e c u p in t h e semi-final. However,
after W e d n e s d a y ' s result against SS/S
1st team, things are s u d d e n l y to look a
w h o l e lot better.
This result s o u n d s like a battering
a n d a battering is what it was. Don't get
m e w r o n g , SS/S are a g o o d side but this
day b e l o n g e d to IC. The first goal c a m e
s o o n , after the start o f t h e g a m e f r o m
a beautiful m o v e started by Peter C a m p -
bell, continued by A m a h and finished by
Dave, f r o m the most unlikely source -
Inaki t h e superkeeper. A long goal kick
(aided by the wind) b o u n c e d just inside
their b o x a n d p r o c e e d e d to d i p over
their bewildered keepers h e a d - 2-0.
The third a n d fourth goals c a m e s o o n
after f r o m A m a h a n d Peter C a m p b e l l .
IC battled into the w i n d in t h e sec-
o n d half a n d s h o c k e d SS/S by scoring a
5th s u p p l i e d again by M r . C a m p b e l l ,
super defender. T h e sixth c a m e s o o n
after supplied by D a n Waight. I w o u l d
again like to stress that SS/S are a g o o d
t e a m a n d are third in the league but w e
w e r e just outstanding o n t h e day. It is
as simple as that.

IC III- .2
Faced with t h e worrying danger of rel-
e g a t i o n , it w a s a resolute third t e a m
w h o turned up at Shenley, d e t e r m i n e d
lo defeat a strong U C L t e a m , a n d gain
3 valuable points. Playing against a gale
in t h e first half, IC d e f e n d e d like lions,
Ricky, in goal, still h a d to p r o d u c e a
string o f outstanding saves to leave it at
0-0 at half time. Having w e a t h e r e d the
storm (literally), IC mistakenly thought
the grave w a s there for the taking, a n d
started t h e s e c o n d half slickly. U C f are
a d e c e n t , a n d h a v i n g s e e n a f e w
c h a n c e s d e n i e d by t h e still excellent
Ricky, eventually m a n a g e d to score.
This set back proved a catalyst to IC,
w h o finally started to take control. How-
ever, with just 10 minutes to g o , it w a s
still 1-0 t o U C f . T h e n , t h o u g h , t h e ball
b r o k e to M a g i c o n t h e right, w h o s e
sweet first time cross w a s m e t by O l e .
The 'keeper saved well h e w a s there to
bury t h e r e b o u n d . U C L again raised
the pressure, but this gave M a l c o l m the
c h a n c e to lead a devastating counter
attack. Having carried t h e ball for 60
yards, his cross fell eventually Ole, w h o
f i n i s h e d coolly. C u e ecstasy - only
slightly d a m p e n e d by t h e UCL bus sod-
d i n g o f f without us.

A w i n today practically guarantees us
w i n n i n g t h e U C premier league.
Before t h e g a m e w e thought that
the g a m e might actually b e quite diffi-
cult but w e w e r e mistaken - it w a s a
thrashing. T h e first half b e g a n without
the legendary presence o f Bigger Titties
a n d Pink G a s h . However, all w a s not
lost. T h e passing w a s exceptional (occa-
sionally), with t h e ball rarely returning to
the IC half. O n c e fast break Blue Under-
pants r o u n d e d t w o plays before setting
up J u m b o B w a n a w h o took 3 attempts
to put t h e ball past t h e keeper.
The s e c o n d half started nervously,
s e e i n g H o l l o w a y put pressure o n IC's D
for 5 minutes, not h e l p e d by Ic's inabil-
ity to get the ball out safely.
But t h e d e f e n c e c a m e g o o d , not
allowing Holloway to convert any of this
pressure. A d e m o n run by 11 plus s a w
the ball reach Bigger Titties stick less
than a foot from t h e goal. The third goal
w a s a tribute to Pink G a s h ' s s p e e d ,
aggression a n d dedication (!). Feeling
sorry for the opposition M r . T gave the
ball to their CF a n d let t h e g a m e rest at
3 - 1 .

UCLMS II
Yet another cliff-hanger in the saga o f the
disco boys. W e g r o u n d out this result
with blood, sweat, tears a n d Rezoola's
Pants. Grrrr...
The match started with a bit o f fire,
with play f l o w i n g both ways, a l t h o u g h
not at the s a m e time, obviously. I'm find-
ing It hard to admit, but the m e d i c s c u m
did appear to have the upper h a n d to
start with. Ten minutes into t h e match,
Casanova briefly b e c a m e lost In d r e a m s
of a lilting Welsh voice, in the throes o f
an orgasm, calling his n a m e . While h e
stood there dazed, his m a n gave him the
slip, a n d before Casanova could catch
him, the medics had o p e n e d the scoring.
0-1 to the medics.
But, if our e n e m i e s strike us d o w n ,
w e c a n only g e t stronger. O u r fires
surged higher a n d not five minutes h a d
passed before the S u n d a n c e Kid c o n -
verted a n u n o r t h o d o x short corner. 1-1
The battle raged. Every tackle w a s hard
fought; every pass had to count. 10 min-
utes before half-time, I abio decapitated
o n e o f t h e opposition in o u r D, a n d t h e
u m p i r e harshly gave the medics a short
corner. Despite o u r d e f e n c e s valiant
efforts, t h e m e d i c s m a d e it count. 1-2
But o u r heads w e r e not b o w e d - w e
cranked u p t h e pressure, p r o b i n g for
chinks in their armour. It w a s nearly half-
t i m e w h e n t h e D i s c o S q u a d b r o k e
t h r o u g h , a n d t h e ball fell to Indian Car-
pet Catalogue in t h e middle of t h e D.
Time s l o w e d . His heartbeat p o u n d e d
out a frantic r h y t h m in his h e a d . H e
d i v e d a n d s k i m m e d . Unnecessarily,
because no-one w a s attempting to tackle
h i m . H e picked his spot a n d flicked t h e
ball into the air. It s e e m e d to h a n g for-
ever, before l o o p i n g back d o w n under
the bar a n d hitting t h e back of the net.
2-2, a n d t h e c r o w d w e n t wild.
In the second-half w e took the g a m e
to t h e m . O u r spirits always gave us t h e
e d g e , a n d this match w a s n o exception.
Chances c a m e again a n d again, but lady
luck w a s n o t smiling o n filtrum, Lager
Lager a n d Indian Carpet Catalogue. But,
with less than 4 minutes to g o , w e w o n
a shortie. The S u n d a n c e Kid s w o o p e d in
a n d it w a s 3-2 to t h e Disco Boys. C o m e
o n !
A n d so, with this victory under o u r
belts, p r o m o t i o n b e c k o n s m o r e entic-
ingly than B r o n w y n after a brace o f bev-
erages a n d a hearty vomit. Disco!
