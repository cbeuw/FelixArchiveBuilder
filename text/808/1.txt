THE 10- OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Students unhappy over
Silwood conference centre
The College has announced its intention to convert the Main House at
Silwood Park into a conference centre. The Postgraduates at the Park are
worried about the effect that the centre1
will have on their own facilities.
They are concerned that they will lose married student accommodation,
kitchen facilities and access to the Main House for social events.
The college hope to earn money not for selling drinks.
by building a centre which will
provide accommodation for thirty
people. The centre will contain a
restaurant and private dining room
and the College are considering a
plan to use profits from Harlington
Gravel to build a swimming pool
and a squash court for conference
guests, staff and students.
Plans for the centre have been
draughted and the Biology
Department has been moved into
new buildings to make room for the
centre. The College is currently
trying to raise money for the project,
estimated at between 1.4 and 4
million pounds and is hoping to
conduct a feasibility study on the
scheme.
Should the project prove
successful the College plan to
construct an accommodation block
for conference guests and a new
lecture theatre in the Main House.
The students at Silwood are
concerned that the development will
cause the loss of the Student's
Union's facilities. The long term
future of the Union building is
uncertain and the Union fear that
the building may have to be
demolished to make for the planned
expansion in the Conference Centre
accommodation. In an interview
with FELIX on Wednesday, Estates
Secretary, Mr Cameron Clark said
that there were no immediate plans
to use the Union building, but said
that it "may or may not be the sight
for a new accommodation block" in
the future.
The Student's Union are also
unhappy about a plan to move the
bar in the union building into the
Main House. The Postgraduates will
be able to use the old bar area, but
"Its no use having a split Union
with a bar on one site and facilities
on another" said Union President,
Ian Lowles.
The new bar is expected to serve
drinks at an increased price to
conference guests, but will be open
to students in the evening for drinks
at a cheaper price.
The development will mean the
loss of three flats for married
students and the Union are hoping
in use, that it is unsuitable for
families and that it has insufficient
kitchen and bathroom areas. At
present the Southwood II block
contains 4 couples, two of which are
in single rooms, 2 families and two
single students.
Students are also worried that they
will lose access to the Main Hall and
Conservatory which are regularly
used for social events. The College
has given verbal assurances to the
Students that they will be able to
book rooms in the centre on a 'first
come first serve' basis, but it is likely
that they will have to book the
rooms a number of months in
advance. The union fear that this
to appoint an Accommodation
Officer to try and locate cheap flats
for married students in the Reading
area. Since the sale of Sandyride
house in April, Silwood has lost five
of its flats for married students. Mr
Cameron Clark told FELIX that
accommodation for married
students was available in the
Southwood block which contains
double rooms which can be
interconnected. The Union argue
that this accommodation is already
will put an end to their social events.
Silwood administrator Keith Fisher
told FELIX that he didn't think that
this would be a problem, "It may
mean that students have to get
organised to use the house" he said.
It is unlikely that the Silwood Ball,
organised by the Royal College of
Science Union will be able to take
place next year. Work on the new
centre is set to begin in the Spring
of next year.
Trashed!
Three groups of squatters were
evicted last Friday from the student
residences in Hamlet Gardens
following a court injunction. The
squahers have caused several
thousand pounds worth of damage
and have been threatening the
Hamlet Gardens staff with violence.
Some of the squatters have since
broken into another Hamlet
Gardens flat owned by the Notting
Hill Housing Trust.
The squatters have been living in
flats 131,137 and 135 the since they
were vacated at the end of last term.
The occupants of one of the flats had
been living in the College's 2.00
block since Christmas until they
were evicted by builders working for
the landlords, Strolmor at the end
of term.
The squatters have been regularly
hurling abuse at the student
managers in Hamlet's Summer
Letting Scheme. One of the
managers, Steve Mercer, told FELIX
that the squatters had hit him in the
ribs with a snooker cue and said that
one of the squatters had threatened
to set a vicious dog onto the staff.
Several residents have also been
threatened including an old lady
who is now too frightened to talk to
the police. The managers also
believe that the squatters are
responsible for a burglary in one of
the flats on July 18th in which Hi Fi
and jewelry were stolen.
Accommodation officer, Loretto
O'Callaghan told FELIX that the
squatters had left the flats in a
disgusting state. One of the flats
was covered in abusive graffiti
directed at the student managers.
Contract cleaners refused to clean
another flat where the squatters
kept a dog and eleven puppies
locked inside. The furniture inside
another flat had been thrown out of
the windows.
The Accommodation Office is
worried that the squatters will move
back into the flats when the
