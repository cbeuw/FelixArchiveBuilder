Summer Letting Scheme finishes.
Mrs O'Callaghan is considering
plans to give students a weeks free
accommodation in an attempt to
ensure that the flats are not left
empty.
Mrs O'Callaghan is critical of the
lack of support given to her by the
police. "Hammersmith Police
Station is very unhelpful and didn't
want to get involved" she said. She
is currently negotiating with the
College to persuade them to take the
squatters to court for assault. She
has asked College to help with the
costs, should the student managers
decide to prosecute.
College Security Chief, Geoff
Reeves told FELIX that the College
had no plans to hire security guards
to police Hamlet when the flats are
vacated at the end of Summer. He
said that the flats were too dispersed
to police effectively and added that
security firms would be unwilling to
deal with the squatters, who he
described as 'psychopaths'. He
went on to say that the only legal
way of removing squatters was to
apply for a coiq-t injuction, a process
which can take months.
Mr Reeves is planning to write to
the Commissioner of Police, the
Secretary of State for the
Environment and the Home
Secretary in an attempt to prevent
the problem recurring. "We need to
get the law clarified with respect to
our property" said Mr Reeves.
Break-In
There was a break-in at Garden Hall
late on Wednesday night. One of
the video games was completely
gutted and the pool table had the
glass ball shoot smashed and ripped
open.
The incident was discovered by
Security at 3.30am and the police
were called. Although there must
have been a lot of noise when the
front was ripped off, splitting the
wood, none of the residents heard
anything: One resident claimed to
have seen people playing pool
around lam when he came home.
The police returned yesterday to
take fingerprints and the games
machine owner came to collect the
machine, 'Karnov', which he says
should be returned by Friday.
New Tutor
Dr David Goodgame, Senior Tutor
in the Chemistry Department, has1
been appointed as a new College
Tutor.
Computer Stolen
An IBM 8D Computer system,
valued at £6000 was stolen from the
Rector's Electrical Engineering
Office on July 15th. The incident is
just one in a series of computer
thefts which have cost the College
insurers an estimated £110,000.
Amongst the computers stolen
was an IBM Landmark Rt
Computer, one of only three in the
world, which was taken from the
Royal School of Mines in April. The
computer was valued at £42,000.
The spate of thefts began at the
start of the year when a BBC
microcomputer was stolen from
ICU's Microcomputer Club in the
Union Building. Since then 26
computers have been taken from the
departments within College.
The thefts are believed to be the
work of ex-members of College.
Security Officer Terry Briley told
FELIX that many ot ihe thefts were
caused by people leaving their
offices unlocked. He added that
thieves were able to by-pass the
security desks by using back exits
left open by members of staff on
their way home.
A description of two men who
were seen attempting to steel a
computer in the Electrical
Engineering Department on 28th
July has been circulated to College
Security. The men are described as
being of Asian origin, one 5ft 6 and
stocky with a beard and the other
5ft 9, thin with dark spikey hair. The
men have been seen loitering
outside the departments where the
thefts have occured. Mr Briley has
asked anyone seeing these men to
contact Security on 5372.
Hamlet Gardens after the squatters
r
Accomodation
A new accommodation block for
postgraduate students is to be built
at Silwood park. The College will be
taking out a loan to build the new
block which will be paid back by
increases in student rents. The new
block will replace the William
Penney block which is to be used for
short course accommodation.
Students at Silwood are pleased
by the move as they feel that the
William Penney block is unsuitable
for long term students. The block
suffers from poor lighting, small
kitchens and very poor sound
proofing between rooms.
Refit
Asbestos
Contractors have removed frayed
asbestos lagging from the
Underwater Club. The asbestos,
which was found to be in a
dangerous condition was replaced
by expanded foam cladding. The
College Estates Section arranged for
the asbestos to be removed after
Union President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge threatened to call in the
Health and Safety Executive. Estates
also plan to remove the asbestos
from a fire door in the Scout &
Guide storeroom and the Union are
pressing for asbestos in a storage
area beneath Biet to be cleared.
The Sherfield refectory is being
refurbished over the Summer at a
cost of £300,000. The new look
refectory will feature padded chairs,
formica tables and a suspended
ceiling designed for easy
maintainance. Three serveries are
planned with illuminated display
cases for the food with new
entrances and exits designed to cut
down queueing time. Two of the
serveries will serve tradtional
refectory meals, whilst the third will
serve pasta and salads. A public
address system, paid for by the
Queens Gate trust will enable the
refectory to be used for social
functions.
The College has agreed to pay out
.an extra £30,000 for a lighting
system designed by the Rector's
wife, Clare Ash. The system,
consisting of about fifty low voltage
lamps and twenty two wall lights
aimed at the ceiling, will replace the
original economy strip lighting
planned for the refectory. Mrs Ash
is also planning to redesign the
colour scheme in the new refectory.
Refectory Manager, Rob Northey
told FELIX "I hope its going to be
a hell of a lot less like a school dining
room". The project is due for
completion by September 25.
Unfortunately there are no plans to
refurbish the range of food on offer.
