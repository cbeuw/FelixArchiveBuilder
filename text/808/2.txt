About Town
Acton Venture Day
At the end of the last academic year Imperial College Community Action Group donated £250 to the Acton
Saturday Venture Club. The Club, which runs a play centre for youngsters with special needs, used the money
to fund an outing to Chessington Zoo. Alistair Goodall went along to investigate.
The weather was none too good as
we drove to the zoo whilst the two
vans picked up the children from
the Acton area.
The sky relented in time for the
arrival of the vans with their full
complements of children, although
I'm not sure just how many went
because nobody was in the same
place for long enough to be counted.
According to the club's annual
report, there are '29 members aged
between 6 and 24 with a predominance
of youngsters with special needs,
including those with physical and
mental disabilities and their able-bodied
friends'. This extract doesn't do
justice to the pack of loud,
exuberant and very energetic kids
who make it all worthwhile.
Everyone managed to stay
together as we went round the
Children's Zoo with its rabbits,
guinea pigs and other furry
creatures. There seemed to be a
slight lack of rustic knowledge when
donkeys were greeted by a 'Moo'
and horses by a 'Baaa' but this was
soon rectified with some great, if
one sided, conversations.
The signs to all the rides soon
proved all too alluring and so,
impatient to risk life and limb, small
groups of children and helpers soon
dashed off in search of this World
of Adventure.
Half an hour after we had
arranged to rendez-vous at the
entrance we were still missing one
child who was in a wheelchair. We
found out that he had gone off with
some other people unrelated to the
Club (there's nothing like being
independent!).
For myself the nicest aspect both
of the day out and the normal
Saturdays is the way that the
children are so ready to trust you
and 'be friends with you'. This
places a responsibility on you not to
abuse their trust in any way but at
the same time it lets you into their
group where you really can have a
great time.
ICCAG's involvement with the
Club is limited to putting people in
touch with them and having a
student representative on their
Committee. The club meets on
alternate Saturdays at a purpose-
built playcentre for disabled children
and go on a number of trips
throughout the year. The activities
at the playcentre can range from
pushing a child on a bike, to
handicrafts and baking. Volunteer
helpers are supposed to 'assist
youngsters with their games and
creative attempts'. In practice this
means that they can have great fun
and can act in a childish manner
without anyone noticing.
Should you be interested in this
or any other form of voluntary work
then get in touch with ICCAG via
the pigeonhole in the Union Office
or come along on the Soup Run
(meet Thursdays, 9.15pm in Week's
Hall Basement Kitchen) which is our
other main activity.
Squash
The Imperial College Union
Postgraduate Group hosted the
inter-departmental postgraduate
teams squash championship at the
Sports Centre on July 12.
The eight teams vying for the
Professor Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson
Trophy were split into two groups:
Group A: Civil Eng, ICCC,
Management Science A, Chem Eng.
Group B: Materials, Management
Science B, Physics, Mech Eng.
The tournament was organised
along the lines of the European
football championships with the top
two teams from each group
qualifying for the semi-finals. The
qualifying round was complicated
by the fact that each department had
to play in twelve matches with a
restriction that a player could not be
used more than twice. The team
captains could use a team of
minimum strength or use players
only once and go for a player
participation bonus by using more
than the minimum strength team,
since the bonus points for player
participation were significant they!
could not be ignored.
The group qualifiers saw Civ Eng
and ICCC, with Materials and Mech
Eng go through from Group A and
B respectively
Semis
The semi-finals provided a lot of
drama. After the qualifying matches
ICCC, Materials and Civ Eng all
looked possible winners.
Everyone knew that Materials
versus ICCC was going to be close.
Ming Tan beat Steve Berry 9-2, 9-4
in a match of power play which saw
not a single drop shot. John
McCairn (ICCC) beat Richard
Sweeney (Mat) equally convincingly
9-2, 9-2. Alex Brennan (ICCC) beat
Jon Durn (Mat) 9-1, 9-1. ICCC had
won two matches and lost one and
they lead by an accumulated total of
42-23 ball points. Things looked
ominous for Materials because even
if the Materials lady won her match
9-0, 9-0 Materials would still be
pipped 42-41. However it had been
decided that in the event of a team
winning two matches and also
loosing two matches against an
opponent, the winner of the ladies
match would decide the tie break.
The Materials lady had everything
to play for and took her team into
the finals.
The other semi-finals saw Mech
Eng beating Civ Eng after the Civ
Eng captain and squash supremo
Alison West did not use the best
four players at her disposal.
Finals
The finals were not as close as one
would have hoped, Materials ran
through easy winners, after winning
the first three matches, leaving the
ladies match to be inconsequential.
The squash tournament finished
at 8.15pm after over 10 hours of play
on all four courts.
The final order of the teams was:
Champions Materials
Runners up Mech Eng
3rd ICCC
4th Civ Eng
5th Physics
6th Management Sci A
7th Management Sci B
8th Chem Eng
The trophy presentation in
Southside Upper Lounge saw Pro-
Rector Professor Brian Coles name
the trophy after Sir Geoffrey
Wilkinson Nobel Laureate who is
retiring from the College this year
and was a keen squash player at one
time. The trophy was presented to
Ming Tan, veteran of Material's
victory in 1987.
Editorial
Hamlet Gardens: The student
managers at Hamlet Gardens have
been harrassed and threatend by
squatter vigilantes since the
beginning of the Summer. The
squatters have been evicted, but
they left Hamlet in a disgusting
conditon. I visited one of flats after
it had been cleaned; the stench was
sickening. More sickening though is
the College's laissez fair approach.
Year after year, FELIX runs stories
about the dammage caused by
squatters. The student managers
can not be expected to cope with the
problem by themselves; unless
something is done, the squatters
will return at the end of the
Summer. Loretto O'Callaghan and
the managers have done an
excellent job, but they should not be
expected to do the job alone.
Congratulations to Dave Smedley
for completing the Union Handbook
and to Adrian Bourne for
completing City and Guild's
handbook, Spanner. Both of them
have produced excellent
publications
Thanks to; Rose, without whom this
issue had no chance, Dave, Steve
Meyfroidt, Steve Kilmurray, Doug
King, Dave Griffiths, Mick Godfrey
and Mark, Yishu and Alistair.
Will anyone stop Materials next
year? Materials master tactician
Ming-Jen Tan will be here next year
to try and make it a hat-trick for
them.
They will be a tough nut to crack
if Prof Sheppard makes a re-
appearance for Materials next year
after missing this year's
tournament. The professor provided
plenty of spice in the 1987
tournament.
It looks like the Wilkinson Trophy
will become a focal point of inter-
departmental squash competition in
the years to come.
