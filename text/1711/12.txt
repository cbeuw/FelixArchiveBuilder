Outlying Islands: A Dark Exploration of Isolation
T
he King’s Head
Theatre is a
charming loca-
tion in Islington
fronted by an eccen-
tric-looking, cosy pub.
Walking past the bar- after
collecting an essential
beverage- takes you to the
small and intimate thea-
tre, already full of tipsy
patrons; this jovial atmos-
phere was truly a highlight
of the experience. It was,
however, in stark contrast
to the themes of the play
itself.
Outlying Islands
follows the story of two
young ornithologists,
Robert (Tom Machell) and
John (Jack McMillan),
who travel to the Outer
Hebrides, at the wish
of the Ministry, aiming
to study the birds that
populate a remote island.
They spend a month in
this lonely place with no
company outside of the
island’s leaseholder (Ken
Drury) and his niece,
Ellen (Rose Wardlaw). In
such complete isolation,
the play ruminates on the
expectations of society,
sexuality, patriotism and
the raw power of nature.
Immediately, the
audience feels the remote-
ness of the island and its
inhabitants through the
clever staging. Light is an
important and effective
tool to this end, illuminat-
ing only part of the stage
at a time and oftentimes
mimicking only the weak
glow of the lamp that
lights the abandoned
chapel where Robert and
John must stay. Sound
is also vital. It is used
throughout the perfor-
mance to create the sense
of a cold wind and this,
along with the smoke that
pervades the scene, draws
the audience in to that
same sense of unfamiliar-
ity and coldness. Overall,
the experience is nothing
short of immersive.
In this intimate setting,
the inhabitants find that
‘some force pulls’ and
the island slowly claims
their minds. The civilised
manner of John is tested
repeatedly by the tactless
and carefree nature of
Robert. There is tangible
tension between the
pair on more than one
occasion, pitting societal
norms directly against
natural instinct. In this
way, Robert’s character
is particularly interest-
ing and in little time, it
becomes clear than he will
do as he pleases based
purely on animal desire.
He voices his envy of the
birds he studies, com-
menting that ‘they allow
themselves to be taken’
and through this, his want
of freedom is painfully
clear. He also holds quite
venomous opinions
against humanity and
stresses that nature should
be protected from human
destruction, obviously far
more at home amongst
the birds than with other
people.
As the narrative pro-
gresses, both Robert and
Ellen become increasingly
reckless, throwing away
all regard of what may be
considered proper. Primal
desire drives them both
and John is openly afraid
of these developments, as
he is driven by genuine
and honest feeling; again,
opposition between
expectations and fancy.
All four characters of
the play repeatedly refer
to the island as a ‘pagan
place’ and perhaps this
accounts for the apparent
corruption of their minds.
Outlying islands is
a heavy performance,
littered with dark tones
and uncomfortable sce-
narios. Although this can
be considered off-putting
for an audience, the tale
is a powerful one and
it’s telling, powerful
also. More generally, the
theatre is a wonderful one
and if this review hasn’t
piqued your interest then
I leave you with one more
fact: The King’s Head has
the largest selection of ice
cream of any theatre in
London.
Improbable fiction upon a stage
T
he charming
ambience of
S o u t h w a r k
Playhouse greets
us with a charismatic mix-
ture of bar, flexible theatre
space and creativity hub.
It is clear that this venue
wants to break conven-
tion. Getting access to the
performance room means
exchanging a ticket for a
wristband, gliding past a
rainbow of hanging cloth
strips, finding a seat in a
square arena to the sound
of electronic drones and
chatting to the cast while
waiting for everyone
to settle in. All set for
a “music-festival-like”
welcome to the party-hard
land of Illyria, where,
amidst some energetic
dance moves, each
actor introduces their
(multiple) characters and
the accompanying outfit
changes. This was rather
unnecessary: spelling out
everything dumbs down
the audience.
Often the background
music or the shouting of
other players is too loud
to allow the words to be
heard, and the clumsy
attempts to introduce
modern songs that contrast
oddly with the archaic
language create an overall
sense of displacement and
lack of direction. Some
details in the plot are over-
looked, making it hard to
understand circumstances
and to follow later devel-
opments. New as I am to
the world of Shakespeare,
I only understood the
relationship between
Olivia, the Duke and
Sir Toby, or the reasons
that led Viola to disguise
herself as a man, upon
arriving home and reading
relevant Wikipedia pages.
The unexplained change
in one character’s gender,
with resulting language
and context quirks,
makes a plot already full
of cross-dressing and
mistaken identities even
more muddled. And some
moments are purely dis-
tasteful, with professional
entertainers waving along
to their own bad singing
like shy teenagers in a
school-day production.
Credit must be given
to a couple of features,
though. Fighting scenes
are remarkably comic (I
refuse to spoil!), as are
the built-in interactions
with the public. Take a
seat in the front row at
your own risk! I was just
one seat away from my
shot at the stage and had
to turn my neck a couple
of times to face the actors.
The way misbehaving
props were dealt with was
also graciously comical,
so much so that I was
left wondering if it was a
real accident or if I had
just been fooled. Special
mention to the inclusivity
element: one of the char-
acters is mute, with others
voicing over. Actress
Caroline Parker worked
with sign language inter-
preters to master this role.
Quite a contrast, given
her other character’s
violent loquaciousness!
Her all-around brilliant
performance clearly stole
the show at every chance.
The best of this
production is really
the light-heartedness,
comical joy imbued in
every scene. After all
these years, and in the
hands of competent
actors, Shakespeare’s wit
keeps making everyone
laugh.
