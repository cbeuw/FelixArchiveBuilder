The convoluted road to Kingdom Hearts 3				
With the final chapter of the Xehanort Saga of the Kingdom Hearts series almost upon our doorstep, Felix Games
is here to offer a retrospective look at the love child of Square Enix and Disney.

Anthony Onwuli
Games Editor
B
ack in 2002,
Square Enix
( d e v e l o p e r s
for the Final
Fantasy and Dragon
Quest franchises) and
Disney collaborated on
a video game project
which resulted in the first
Kingdom Hearts game on
the PlayStation 2. Since
then the franchise has
gone on to grow in many
different directions as the
story has become more
complex with 14 titles
released over the past
17 years having shipped
over 25 million copies
worldwide.
Where and How
Did It All Begin?
At TGS 2004, the
Kingdom Hearts Director
Tetsuya Nomura revealed
that the series started when
a Square game producer,
Shinji Hashimoto, was
guided by fate to meet
a top Disney executive
whilst in an elevator.
How did this coincidental
meeting happen? Well,
Square and Disney used to
work in the same building.
Hashimoto delivered
his elevator pitch to the
executive and in February
2000, development began
for Kingdom Hearts.
The story, which
originally was going to be
aimed at Disney’s target
audience was reimagined
to become as great and as
epic as the stories told in
the Final Fantasy series.
With Nomura developing
the story to be about the
themeofcharacter’shearts
(and trust me on this,
“hearts” alongside other
key phrases, “Darkness”,
“Sora, Donald, Goofy”
are repeated endlessly
in this franchise), and
by thinking of Disney
theme parks, like Animal
Kingdom, Square’s new
IP would soon bare the
title Kingdom Hearts - the
name Kingdom wouldn’t
have been enough for
Square.
To test the waters of
the future of the series,
Nomura put a secret movie
at the end of the first game
using Disney’s assets. For
Nomura, he believed there
was no reason to change
the worlds, but instead
that it was Square’s
prerogative to bring out
the best of what Disney
has already done with
their characters.
Speaking of characters,
various adaptions of the
Final Fantasy characters
have appeared throughout
the series, from cartoonish
versions of beloved
characters to darker,
mysterious adaptations of
others. This feeds into the
excitement surrounding
each new title in the series,
with fans wondering
which Disney worlds
and what Final Fantasy
characters will be featured
in the latest release.
Releases
So in the past 17 years,
the following games
have been released:
Kingdom Hearts, Chain
of Memories, Kingdom
Hearts II, Re: Chain of
Memories, coded, 358/2
Days, Birth by Sleep,
Re: coded, Dream Drop
Distance, 1.5 Remix, χ,
2.5 Remix, Unchained
χ and 2.8 Final Chapter
Prologue. Some may
call it marketing genius,
some may call it insanity
with how spread out the
Kingdom Hearts series
is with its releases on a
multitude of different
consoles and handhelds:
PlayStation 2, Gameboy
Advance, mobile phones,
Nintendo DS, PlayStation
Portable, Nintendo 3DS,
PlayStation 3, PlayStation
4 and soon the Xbox
One with the release of
Kingdom Hearts 3. Some
fans will have purchased
some of these consoles
just for the sake of playing
a Kingdom Hearts game,
while others may have
missed games out in the
franchise because they
were unaware that the
game held plot relevance
due to not being released
on a home console – an
issue fixed with the HD
Remixes.
The Story of the
Franchise
If you asked me to
tell what the Kingdom
Hearts series is about,
then I’d probably come
up with something like
“it’s about the adventures
of a young boy called
Sora who traverses many
different Disney Worlds
and meets many different
Disney and Final Fantasy
characters and his weapon
of choice is an oversized
key called the Keyblade.”
This sentence both sums
up the series whilst
simultaneously tells you
nothing. Ask any fan to
explain you the intricate
details of the story and
they’ll be at a lost for
words.
With Kingdom Hearts
3 releasing today (Friday
25th January) in Japan and
next week. Tuesday 29th
January, internationally,
here’s a succinct overview
of what is a deeply
convoluted story (wish
me luck and SPOILER
WARNING).
ments of pure light) as a
result of this war.
Birth By Sleep
BBS is set 10 years
prior to the events of the
original game and details
the origins of the current
villain of the series,
Xehanort.
Xehanort was a young
man who lived on the
Destiny Islands and as he
grew up he became in-
creasingly obsessed with
the legends of old, the
legends of the Keyblade
War. He believed that
the universe was too far
aligned with the light
and believes that the
world should be perfectly
balanced (as all things
should be) – equal light
andequaldarkness.Tothis
end he alters the destinies
of three young Keyblade
warriors – Ventus, Aqua
and Terra. His actions
result in Ventus being left
comatose after Ventus
defeats Vanitas, the being
of pure darkness ex-
tracted from Ven’s heart;
Terra loses possession
of his body as Xehanort
transfers his own heart
into Terra’s body; Aqua
becomes trapped in the

as sequel bait. This form
of sequel baiting has now
become a tradition for
the franchise to tease us
fans about the upcoming
releases.
Disney and Final
Fantasy?
No one could have
predicted that merging
Final Fantasy characters
with Disney characters
and worlds would have
led to the amazing action
RPG that was Kingdom
Hearts. Though with the

it was surprising that
Square were not given

First of all, yes, the
mobile game is partly

the events which led up to
the Keyblade War. There
were five different unions

by the Foretellers and the
purpose of these unions
were to gather Lux (a form
of light). A legendary

realm of darkness after
trying to save Terra from
the darkness.
Xehanort gets split in
two in between the events
of BBS and KH1 and this
results in two new entities
being made called the
Heartless and the Nobody.
A Heartless, ironically
enough, is the manifested
heart of a person who has
succumbed to darkness,
while a Nobody is the
body and soul of a person
who has lost their heart.
These names must have
been given ironically.
Xehanort’s Heartless
calls himself Ansem and
his Nobody calls himself
Xemnas. Xemnas goes on
to lead an organisation of
nobodies called Organisa-
tion XIII.
KH1
At the start of the first
game, Sora’s home world
is attacked by Heartless
and he loses both of his
friends, Kairi and Riku.
Sora ends up on a quest
alongside Donald Duck
and Goofy to save the
other Dinsey worlds from
the darkness – a mission
given to them by King
Mickey.
Sadly though, Riku
gets lured into darkness
by Maleficent as he tries
to find Kairi through his
own means. The puppet
master behind the two
of them is the Heartless
called Ansem, who pos-
sesses Riku during the
events of the first game.
What was Ansem’s goal
in all of this? Well, using
Maleficent, he manipulat-
ed several Disney villains
to capture Seven Prin-
cesses of Heart. Seven?
Haven’t we already heard
this number before? Well,
yes we have. The seven
fragments of pure light
became the hearts of the
princesses. Turns out that
Kairi was one of these
princesses, however hear
heart latched onto Sora’s
during the invasion of
their home world. To
give Kairi her heart back,
Sora uses Riku/Ansem’s
keyblade to carve out his
heart. Remember what
happened to Xehanort?
Well, something slightly
different happens here.
Nobodies of both Kairi
and Sora are created,
Namine and Roxas re-
spectively.
COM and Days
Naminé has the power
to manipulate Sora’s
memories, so some rebels
withintheorganisationuse
her in attempt to control
our keyblade wielding
protagonist. Sora defeats
various members of the
organisation in Castle
Oblivion. However, to
restore Sora’s memories,
Naminé puts Sora into a
yearlong stasis.
During this time, Riku
also finds himself in the
Castle as he struggles with
the darkness inside of him
and also encounters and
defeats members of the
organisation. Riku will
now spend the next year
trying to help recover
Sora’s memories.
Now onto Sora’s
Nobody, Roxas. Xemnas
recruits Roxas into the or-
ganisation as the thirteenth
member. With a keyblade
wielder in the organisa-
tion, Xemnas’ plans to
create his own Kingdom
Hearts become more of a
reality. Roxas was orig-
inally born without any
memories, but during the
course of 358/2 Days, he
slowly starts to gain the
memories of Sora through
dreams. Eventually,
Roxas’ rebels against the
organisation after being
it’s because no-one can
actually remember.
KH2
The events of Kingdom
Hearts 2, begin with
Roxas being put into a
simulation, by a myste-
rious man named Diz, to
keep him away from the
organisation until he can
re-join with Sora. Upon,
an emotional ending for
Roxas, Sora awakens and
is re-joined by Donald
and Goofy as they head
out to search for Riku and
King Mickey as well as to
stop Organization XIII.
Traversing through more
Disney worlds, Sora and
pals eventually arrive at
The World That Never
Was to finish off the or-
ganisation once and for all
– until the sequel baiting
starts again anyway.
As our heroes prepare
to take down Xemnas,
DiZ reveals himself
to be Ansem the Wise,
Xehanort’s master, not
the Heartless that came
from our main villain.
DiZ attempts to store the
Kingdom Hearts that the
organisation has created
in data He manages
to do some damage to
Kingdom Hearts but is
caught in a blast which
sends him to the Realm
of Darkness (where he
ends up meeting Aqua,
12 years after she was
originally trapped). So our
heroes defeat Xemnas,
and wash up back in their
respective homes for our
happy ending with the
series, done, finished and
completed. Of course not,
this series is too popular
to end.
Coded and DDD
Sora, Kairi and Riku
receive a message in a
bottle from Mickey telling
them about other charac-
ters who still need help
and that Sora is the key to
unlock their suffering. As
well, it’s revealed that the
defeat of Ansem, Seeker
of Darkness and Xemnas
has led to the revival of
Master Xehanort.
To prepare for the
coming battle and to
unlock the power to save
those who are suffering,
Riku and Sora do the
Mark of Mastery exam
to become Keyblade
Masters. During the
events of Dream Drop
Distance, Sora’s exam is
sabotaged by members
from the True Organi-
sation (in case you have
not noticed, this series is
majorly convoluted) and
due to interference from

Xehanort, Sora almost
succumbs to darkness and
nearly becomes a vessel
for Xehanort’s heart.
It is here that the true
purpose of Organisation
XII is revealed – to create
13 vessels who would
bear Xehanort’s heart
and be the 13 Seekers of
Darkness who will clash
with 7 lights to create the
χ-blade. Riku saves Sora
from this fate and passes
the Mark of Mastery.
The Road to KH3
With Xehanort’s true
intentions known, the
only thing that the protag-
onists can do is to recruit
Seven Guardians of Light
who will wield Keyblades
to oppose Xehanort in
Kingdom Hearts 3.

the story as opposed to
1% of it. If you want to
experience the franchise
for yourself, then all the
