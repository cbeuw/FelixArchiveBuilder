here is nothing
fundamentally
objectionable
about a beret.
It is a piece of headgear
that prevents heat loss
from the scalp. This is
in the same way as there
is nothing wrong with a
single influenza virus. It
is unlikely to do any harm
by itself. What is scary,
however, is when there
are lots of them all packed
into a small area such as a
theatre bar, be that berets
or influenza viruses. Then
it is time to start worrying.
So begins my unified
theory of dramatic criti-
cism. Tune in next week
for my views on continen-
tal breakfasts.
Approaching Empty is
a dramatization of a book
by Ishy Din, an ex-cab
driver and unreformed
playwright, about a taxi
cab office and the two
friends, Raf and Mansha,
who run it. When Raf
decides to sell the
business to a competitor,
Mansha (along with some
friends) scrapes together
the money to buy the
place. However, when Raf
presents the new owners
with a different set of
books that reveal the real
state of the company, the
men’s friendship is shown
to be not as strong as it
appeared. The writer’s
intention was that while
the plot of the play affects
“Raf and Mansha…
it could quite easily
be Harry and Jack in a
backstreet garage, or June
and Margaret in a greasy
spoon. It’s very much
about working class com-
munities and the themes
could be applied to many
different communities and
peoples.”
Unfortunately Din
is less than successful
in this. Both Raf and
Mansha are characters
out of a children’s book;
the slimy owner, Raf,
who says “business” more
often than Donald Trump
and the cardigan-wearing
Mansha who likes “things
the way they are”. This
is a fairy tale without
any depth, and Raf and
Mansha simply fall into
tired old tropes of an
evil boss and a faithful
employee who is cheated
by the system.
Nowhere is this more
evidentthanthefirstfifteen
minutes which begin with
news of Margret Thatch-
er’s death. “Bitch” spits
Mansha. I will give Din
credit for something – he
knew for whom he was
writing. The whole crowd
erupts into guffaws. Raf’s
spirited defense of the
necessity of her policies
places him firmly in the
‘unsympathetic charac-
ters’ category.
At every point there
are glimmers of a play
that might have been. Din
says that “the universality
of the story is that it’s
about friendship, it’s
about families, it’s about
community, it’s about
this effect by slicing the
world into goodies and
baddies. Why does Raf
cheat Mansha? He does
it because no one is using
taxis anymore; he is trying
to put his son through
university and he can’t
bear to be seen to have
failed. These are all very
human and understanda-
ble motives and yet they
are obscured by a comic
book villain style goatee,
his shiny shoes and his
constant repetition of
“being in business means
you have to be heartless”.
At one point he seems
almost ready to sacrifice
his son for his greed.
There are other flaws in
the play, too; the dialogue
is spoken without pauses
in between lines, making
me, in the audience, feel
as though I was being
waterboarded with words.
I would prefer,
however, to speak about
the positives. Sameena
(played by Rina Fatania)
is a fantastic breath of
fresh air in an otherwise
stale production. She is
a single mother recently
out of jail on a mission to
get her children back and
to provide for them. She
is convinced by Mansha
to put the money that she
receives from the sale of
her parents’ house into
buying the taxi firm and
is ruined when the truth
emerges. She is crimi-
nally underutilised and I
find myself wondering if
Din had expended all of
his creativity on writing
her and then, having
run out of ideas, simply
plugged his brain into the
Momentum Twitter feed
and put his pen on auto
pilot.
The shadow of a play
about the effects of de-
industrialisation on the
north of England is there
in the script, but like the
peeling and faded map
that takes up the whole
back wall of the set, it is a
pathos-inducing imitation
of the real thing.

“A comic book

betrayal.”
One of the most
touching and painful
things about watching the
plot unfold is the horror of
watching the metaphor-
ical train hurtle towards
the allegorical collapsed
bridge. Raf and Mansha
are not just best friends.
They have lived and
worked together for years
and their families are
connected by marriage.
The claustrophobia of the
small cab office in which
the play is set is mirrored
by the more ephemeral
but no less present claus-
trophobia of the ever
vigilant wider community.

A Circus With Totemic Status Like No Other
Cirque du Soleil is back in London this winter with Totem, an elegant exploration of the evolution of mankind.
I
f you were anything
like me as a child,
then you loved
going to the circus.
It was a rare occasion – it
never happened more
than once a year – but
it was always magical.
The whole atmosphere
was buzzing before the
show had even started;
the smell of popcorn and
cotton candy filling the
air and children walking
around waving those tiny
LED light wands you can
buy at circuses. Then the
show would start, and I’d
be absolutely stunned by
the mix of silly clowns,
athletic acrobats, and
formally-dressed direc-
tors and magicians. After
the show was over I’d go
home dreaming of one
day becoming an acrobat
and running away with
the circus.
Now imagine you
could step all of that
up a notch (read: a few
decades) and enjoy the
circus in a wholly new
and adult way. For those
of you who have been
living under a rock for the
past five years, Cirque du
Soleil is precisely that.
They offer a sophisticated
and contemporary take
on circus which suits any
audience. The Canadian
circus group has actually
been around since the 80s,
but only started picking
up proper speed in the
2000s. This year they are
bringing back one of their
shows from 2010; Totem.
This means time to suit up
and get yourself over to
our beloved Royal Albert
Hall, where you can enjoy
a glass of sparkling wine
and a night of fantastic
(adult) circus!
On Wednesday January
16th
at 7:30pm, it was time
for the premiere. Once I’d
finally calmed my excite-
ment and come to terms
with being in the same
room (I mean, it’s a room,
technically) as Prince
Harry and Meghan, and
to there being a blue man
dressed like a disco ball
hanging from the ceiling,
I could focus on the co-
herence and chronology
of the show.
It is a story of the origin
“A
sophisticated
and
contemporary
take on circus”
“Totem is a
magnificent
spectacle”
of mankind – the evolution
of life from the deep sea.
The costumes are easily
one of the most amazing
parts of the show, and the
first act brings us back to
the chronological begin-
ning of the Totem story,
the Palaeozoic Era, using
costumes inspired by real
amphibian patterns and
colours. The costumes
we get to see during the
rest of the show draw
influences from different
Amerindian cultures,
Mayan culture, a fusion
of Italian beach culture in
the 80s and Bollywood,
extra-terrestrials, and of
course a range of different
animals.
Totem is not just pretty
acrobatics and costumes
though; it’s a full circus
with music, tricks and
clowns as well. Inter-
estingly enough, all the
pilots and space ships to
humans flying meters up
in the air. Again, I think to
myself: today air travel is
one of the largest culprits
of global warming, some-
thing the Wright brothers
didn’t foresee when they
came up with the three-ax-
is control, nor something
Native American tribes
ever dreamed of when
they collected feathers
from the sacred bald eagle
in awe of its freedom.
This speaks to me during
the show; the juxtapo-
sition between then and
now. Does it have to mean
something though, can’t
you just sit back and enjoy
the show? Absolutely –
Totem is a magnificent
spectacle anyway. I can’t
help but wonder about
this timeline juxtaposition
though, especially as
they suddenly include the
popular Fortnite ‘flossing’
dance in one of the acts,
a move that ties together
the 2010s with the Pal-
aeozoic setting of the
show. “Floss!” a little boy
exclaims and points at the
dancer.
During the night you
will get to see everything
from the classic bar and
beams to unicycles and
diabolos (remember that
thing from your child-
hood?). Certain acts will
acts leave a little to be
desired and can seem a bit
cheap at times. Frequently
involving the drinking of
wine as some sort of relat-
able and laughable factor,
it undermines the beauty
of the rest of the show.
The fact that there still are
clown acts in a circus of
this level seems strange,
even. Overall, however,
the show is thoroughly
entertaining throughout
and fulfils the role of a
more mature and adult
circus. Don’t be as fooled
by this as I was though. I
may be an adult now, but
I still went home in the
same awe as I used to as
a child, dreaming of one
day becoming an acrobat
and running away with
the circus.

clown scenes seem to be
related to water in some
way. I think to myself how
ironic this is in 2019: at a
time where the oceans are
polluted by microplastics
and we are at brink of sig-
nificant rises in sea levels,
what could be more fitting
than a reminder that it was
water from whence we all
ascended one day?
Other than water,
Totem seems to revolve
around the quest for
flight. The audience gets
to see everything from

others will remind you
