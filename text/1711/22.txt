F
allout 76 could
have just been
another shoddy
game sent out to
die, but due to a contin-
uous string of baffling
decisions and mistakes
it has managed to tarnish
Bethesda’s reputation,
possibly irreversibly. For
those unaware of just
how badly Bethesda has
screwed the pooch, let me
take you through the trou-
bled lifetime of Fallout
76.
So firstly, the game
releases and it’s a hollow
shell of a Fallout game,
stripped of much of its
identity and rushed out
the door in an unfinished
state just to make a quick
buck. There was no story
to speak of, a dull and
repetitive grind and the
much lauded player in-
teractions were so poorly
implemented it showed
just how poorly thought
out the multiplayer
aspects were. Top it off
with a cash shop which
would happily sell you
assets ripped straight from
Fallout 4 and you have
a game emblematic of
what’s wrong with triple
A gaming; made all the
bitterer for coming from
Bethesda, thought to be
one of the last bastions of
consumer friendly single
player games. I reviewed
76 overwhelmingly neg-
atively when it released,
and I still feel like I went
easy on it.And it was here,
right as the game released,
that the controversies
begun.
The release itself got
off to a bad start. The
beta was little more
than early access. They
changed almost nothing
afterwards, and didn’t
even wipe progress when
it ended. It was just a ploy
to drive pre-orders, and
that’s a classic red flag.
This “beta” experienced
the strangest bug I’ve
heard of in a long time,
with the game randomly
uninstalling when closed.
This is a 46 GB game
file that would then need
to be re-downloaded.
But you better hope you
don’t have a download
cap on your broadband
because after that the day
one patch was 54 GB.
That’s right, the patch was
bigger than the game itself
despite seemingly fixing
little to nothing. Finally,
when fans who were quite
rightfully feeling burned
approached Bethesda for
a refund they were told
that as they had opened
the game they were no
longer entitled to one, no
matter their play time.
The conspiracy theorist in
me says it wasn’t released
on steam due to the
negative reviews it would
have gotten and the in-
credibly generous refund
policy which would have
decimated their profits. A
fan base in ruins and their
reputation on the line,
there would need to be a
serious effort on their part
week and there is already
new outrage. The now
infamous canvas bag
situation. The “Power
Armour Edition” (collec-
tor’s edition) of the game
was advertised as coming
with, among other things,
a high quality canvas
bag in the Fallout style.
What was received was
a shoddily made nylon
bag which looked like a
Chinese knock off you’d
accidentally buy on eBay.
Bethesda eventually
committed to producing
and delivering real bags
to all owners, but not
without stoking the fire
a bit first. For one, when
people started contacting
Bethesda support they
were told nothing was
going to be done about
it, but that they could all
have 500 atoms (ingame
currency) as compen-
sation. That’s £4 of
intangible compensation
to people who paid up to
£200 for the collector’s
edition. It’s even worse
when you realise it’s a
direct insult to their most
dedicated fans as who else
would pay that much for
a game. Only once the
outrage started to spread
all around the gaming
sphere did they relent.
This situation was exac-
erbated by the fact that
influencers in the media
who were sent this edition
to preview DID receive
a canvas bag, meaning
Bethesda made an active
decision to deceive its
fans. And finally, to top
it all off after collecting
the personal details of
all those who bought the
power armour edition
and were due represent

“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-

these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
in order to fix the damage
that had been done.
Cut forward not even a
bags, Bethesda leaked
their personal details.
Outstanding move.
Thing’s died down for
a while and the collective
gaming consciousness
moved on, with only a
little murmur when it
inexplicably went on
black Friday sale less
than 2 weeks after release.
That is not something that
games that are selling
well do. But focus came
ricocheting back when
Christmas rolled around.
Unsurprisingly for a game
with a cash shop, Bethesda
added some Christmas
themed cosmetics. A bit
of a slap as it was the
only new content since
release, but the real kicker
was the sleazy way they
were sold. Ignoring how
expensive they were (the
Santa costume was £15)
from day one they were
“on sale” for a “discount-
ed price” despite never
actually having sold for
the “original price”. This
is a flagrantly manipula-
tive sales strategy praying
on people’s desire for a
good deal. Best of all,
this is actually a practice
commonly used by mobile
games and has been used
before by EA. Not a good
look there Bethesda.
As the year drew to a
close and the time for new
beginnings was upon us,
what did Bethesda have
planned? How would they
win back favour with the
community? Apparently

destroyed their reputation with a single game
“Entire
websites have
been created
to sell you
hacked and
duped items
so you can skip
the grind”
“They have
shown that
when the chips
are down they
are willing to
treat their fans
with contempt
”
by paying homage to the
Y2K bug. On January first
the nukes broke. In 76, the
nukes are effectively the
endgame content. You can
launch a nuke to create a
high level zone in which
to farm, as well as messing
with other players. It’s
unquestionably a core
feature and one of the
few saving graces of the
game, and with the new
year the system broke and
they couldn’t be launched.
This wasn’t even the first
controversy surrounding
the nukes, as despite it
supposedly being a big
deal to collect launch
codes and fire one off, the
codes weren’t random.
This meant people would
just upload new ones to
reddit, rendering one of
the core gameplay looks
entirely unnecessary.
The broken nukes were
fixed relatively fast, but it
shows how poorly thought
out the game was. It was
released in November,
but they hadn’t properly
planned even 2 months
ahead.
But nothing shows
Bethesda’s incompetence
like the latest in this long
string of embarrassments.
See, the game has had a
hacker problem from day
1, and Bethesda having
never dealt with online
games like this before
have been really strug-
gling to deal with them,
and exploits are patched
but to say some hackers
fall through the cracks
would be a vast under-
statement. However, the
latest development came
when enterprising hackers
realised they could dupli-
cate high level items to
sell to other players. And
just like that, an immense
second hand market
sprung up selling perks,
caps and weapons to other
players for real money. Go
on eBay and you can buy
unofficial weapon packs
for upwards of £200.
Entire websites have been
created to sell you hacked
and duped items so you
can skip the grind. It goes
without saying that this
has entirely decimated the
core gameplay loop, and
the fact people are paying
their rent by hacking a
game is ludicrous. It is
now entirely possible
to see low level players
hopped up on bobble-head
perks taking on endgame
monsters with ease due to
the flood of these items
into the economy.
It doesn’t even end
there. Long time Bethesda
fans know their maps
item in the game. They’re
used for testing things
before release. These
aren’t places you should
be able to reach, but they
leave them in their single
player games because in
theory they do no harm,
and are a neat easter egg
for those willing to dive
through the game files
and do some modding.
However, in a show of
stunning brilliance they
left the developer room in
the Fallout 76 map, and
finally people are getting
in there. Obviously there
is the issue of people
getting high level items
for free, but people have
found weapons and items
in there that are not even
legitimately available in
the game, perhaps because
they were broken or
because they were planned
for release in a later patch.
The final cherry on top of
this whole ordeal is that,
while Bethesda was able
to lock the accounts of all
who got into the developer
room, this lock was paired
with an email that offered
to unlock the account if
the user responded to said
email with instructions
on how to perform the
exploit. That’s right,
Bethesda could see you’d
been in there, but couldn’t
figure out how you did it.
And finally we end up
at the present day and
it should be clear why
people have lost faith in
Bethesda. This whole
ordeal has shown how
little effort actually went
into Fallout 76, and has
shown that Bethesda is
now more than willing
to stoop to new lows
to follow trends in the
pursuit of greater profits.
Their reputation is ir-
reparably tarnished, and
in a short time they’ve
gone from a fan favourite
company to one regarded
with suspicion. Fallout 76
was not just a bad game, it
made people reassess the
way they saw Bethesda
and their previous games.
I find it harder to overlook
the flaws in Fallout 4
after this mess, and am
nowhere near as excited
for The Elder Scrolls 6,
because they have shown
that when the chips are
down they are willing
to treat their fans with
contempt. For Shame.
