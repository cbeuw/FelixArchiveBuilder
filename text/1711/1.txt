onday 21st
January saw
the launch
of Imperial
College Union’s first
Liberation & Commu-
nity Week, with a panel
discussion hosted by the
Deputy President (Wel-
fare), Becky Neil.
The launch event,
which was titled, “Inclu-
sivity Starts Here” and
took place in the Union
Concert Hall, featured a
panel of seven speakers
discussing a range of
topics surrounding equali-
ty, diversity and inclusion.
The speakers also touched
on personal experiences
of microaggressions,
which are unconscious
expressions of racism or
sexism. Attendees at the
event heard more about
why diversity is important
and how every member
of the Imperial commu-
nity can be involved in
making the university
more inclusive. Although
underrepresented stu-
dents were encouraged
to be active, rather than
passive, about equality,
diversity and inclusion -
“If you notice you’re not
being represented, go out
and make those events
and start those projects
yourself” - the importance
of remembering that “the
burden of making sure
we’re all represented
shouldn’t be left on those
of us that are unrepresent-
ed” was also emphasised.
Panel members, includ-
ing Richard Carruthers
(Deputy Director [Careers
Service]), Dr. Rahma
Elmahdi (Senior Teaching
Fellow in Global Health
at the School of Public
Health) and Dr. Vahid
Shahrezaei (Senior Lec-
turer in Biomathematics),
spoke about how they
have advocated for change
and championed diversity.
Final year Biochemistry
student and Student
Trustee, Hafiza Irshad,
talked about her work
with the outreach depart-
ment, working to fully
include Muslim students
attending the summer
camp by accommodating
their prayer times, which
had a positive impact on
the students’ experience.

ers, Professor Tom Welton
