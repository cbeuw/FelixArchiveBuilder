Manon: A triumph of expressiveness in ballet
W
hat a bril-
liant night.
Being quite
a novice to
the ballet world, English
National Ballet’s produc-
tion of Manon was my
first introduction to two
of its stars – the chore-
ographer Sir Kenneth
Macmillan and the bal-
lerina Alina Cojocaru. It
was ballet like I’d never
seen it before, and it was
breathtaking.
Often a problem with
ballet is that it’s actually
a rather bad way to tell
a story – you need to
know the plot beforehand
or you’ll often end up
horribly confused. The
dancing often exists more
to show off the dancers’
abilities than to move the
story along, and expres-
siveness is limited. The
ENB’s recent staging of
the classic Swan Lake,
based on Petipa/Ivanov’s
choreography from 1895,
is an excellent example.
Sublime the music and the
dancers might have been,
but by the time the fourth
set of townspeople / cour-
tiers came out to show off
their dance to the prince,
I – dare I say? – found
myself slightly bored.
Not so with Kenneth
Macmillan’s choreogra-
phy. In Manon, chore-
ographed in 1974, each
movement has a meaning
and emotion behind it. It’s
realistic, almost natural –
or as natural as you can
get when pirouetting in
skintight leotards. Theatre
in ballet form. When
Lescaut’s mistress (Katja
Kaniukova) balances
en pointe on one foot,
coquettishly sliding her
skirts up the other as she
advances towards the
wealthy Monsieur GM, I
feel a thrill myself. Who
knew ballet could be so
sexy?
Drunken ballet – can
you imagine it? Mac-
millan’s choreography
has Manon’s brother,
Lescaut, staggering stone
drunk into the house of
harlots. Played by Jeffrey
Cirio, his gestures are
wild, grand jetés all over
the place, and more than
once I wonder if he’ll
misstep and faceplant
into the floor. But it’s all
a precisely choreographed
illusion – Macmillan’s
imaginative use of classic
ballet techniques and
attention to detail makes it
entirely believable.
The same goes for
our hero Des Grieux, the
student who falls in love
with Manon. There’s a
fantastic scene in Act II
where he sees Manon at
the brothel, now the kept
woman of another man.
Driven to distraction by
grief, he is left all alone
as she leaves on Monsieur
GM’s arm. There is an
abundance of misery and
desolation in the choreog-
raphy, here executed beau-
tifully by Joseph Caley.
Such misery packed into
his simple chaîné turns,
arms wrapped around his
chest as he spins unhappi-
ly across the floor.
But the star of the
show is, beyond a doubt,
Manon herself: Alina
Cojocaru. She’s 37 and
has a daughter, but you
wouldn’t believe it to
look at her. With her
bird-like movements and
her weightless, fairy-like
dancing, she looks about
18 – every inch the young
ingénue that Manon is
at the beginning of the
ballet. Her effortless
dancing and beautiful
lines make for some of
the finest ballet I’ve seen.
And then there’s her ex-
pressiveness. Manon is a
character who undergoes
multiple transformations
– from innocent girl to
ardent lover, and at last
to fallen woman. She
discovers her own sensu-
ality, but is gradually cor-
rupted by money and the
harsh world around her.
Cojocaru brings this trans-
formation to life before
our eyes, with every look
and gesture bringing out
the nuances of Manon’s
complex character.
The most beautiful
parts of the ballet are the
three pas de deux danced
between Manon and her
lover, des Grieux. At their
first meeting, with the shy
innocence of young love.
Then their playful, sensual
duet full of unbridled joy.
And finally, desperation
and passion in equal
measure as Manon meets
her doomed end. Cojocaru
and Caley make each one
a masterpiece. Their in-
terpretation and technical
skill intersect such that we
no longer see them as just
‘ballet dancers’, dutifully
fulfilling parts on stage;
they embody Manon and
des Grieux, their story
playing out before our
eyes in dance form.
Kenneth Macmillan’s
innovative choreography
is the key to this breath-
taking realism. Classical
themes and classical
styles, and yet his chore-
ography feels so fresh and
exciting. Maybe because
Macmillan didn’t come
from the traditional ballet
background. Coming
from a working-class
family and starting ballet
relatively late, he report-
edly always felt himself
an outsider in the insular
world of ballet. This was
despite his considerable
achievements – becoming
the primary choreogra-
pher for the Royal Ballet
and even being knighted
for his services.
He was bit of a
maverick for his time,
a breath of fresh air in
the decorous world of
ballet. Describing the
ballet scene of the 1940s,
he said, “Ballet looked
like window-dressing. I
wanted to make ballets in
which an audience would
become caught up with
the fate of the characters
I showed them.” With
Manon, he certainly
succeeded. No prettified
window-dressing to be
seen here; raw emotions
and feeling take centre
stage. You can’t tear your
eyes away.
