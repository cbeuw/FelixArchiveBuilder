Breaking Down Brexit: A Strong And Stable
Analysis
No time for a deal or a people’s vote, what options are left?

T
heresa May is
in trouble. More
than that, the
whole country is
in trouble. Last week the
government lost its vote
to pass the withdrawal
agreement, a 500-page
legal document taking
the UK out of the EU in
an orderly fashion. She is
to hold another vote on
January the 29th (if she
does not delay this one),
while currently seeking
consultation with other
party leaders and MPs
of different views both
within and outside the
Conservative Party, in an
attempt to pass the deal.
This, however, is
futile. Should Theresa
May manage to get the
deal to pass on the 29th
of January, even if she
got it to pass today, there
still would not be enough
time to pass the 5 major
bills and 600 statutory
instruments (a form of
legislation) that make up
the withdrawal agreement
before Brexit day, 29th
March.
Come the 29th of
March, there are two
outcomes. Either a “hard
Brexit” in the form of
no deal, or an extension/
revocation of article 50.
Should the government
seekanextensionofarticle
50, the 27 member states
of the EU will confer as
to whether to grant this
request or not. The EU has
said previously that they
will not grant an extension
without a good reason.
Theresa May’s schedule
is unlikely to qualify. This
means that Theresa May’s
deal, even if it had parlia-
mentary support, is dead
on its knees.
So what are the other
options? A new ref-
erendum or a changing
of Theresa May’s red
lines, allowing for the
negotiation of a different
withdrawal agreement,
could persuade the EU
to grant an extension to
article 50. EU officials
have stated that they
won’t grant an extension
beyond the European par-
liamentary elections from
starting May 23rd. A new
referendum takes at least
22 weeks to organise,
according to usual par-
liamentary procedure. So
if a new referendum is to
be called, the UK must
request extending article
50, the EU must agree, and
parliament must legislate
the referendum (choosing
and agreeing upon the
question). Should a ref-
erendum be announced
on the day of you reading
this, there will already be
less than 16 weeks. Thus,
the option of a second
referendum can also be
discarded. That means
that the one and only for
the Prime Minister is to
change her Red Lines.
She has shown great re-
luctance to do so, insisting
that no deal must always
be an option, that we
must leave the customs
union and cease freedom
of movement. If she does
compromise on one of her
red lines, she will need
to re-negotiate with the
EU, get a new deal, pass
it through parliament and
get all 5 major bills and
600 statutory instruments
through, all done before
the 29th March, or the
23rd May with an article
50 extension. Not impos-
sible, but again unlikely.
Therefore, it can be safely
stated that at this point, no
deal is looking inevitable.
There is one option,
the unspeakable option,
which must be discussed.
Article 50 can be revoked
by the UK at any time
before March 29th, 11pm.
This would provoke wide-
spread anger amongst
Brexit supporters should
June 23rd, 2016. Some
civil unrest and riots are
being anticipated by the
government whom are
preparing to put 3500
military staff on the streets
after Brexit day to retain
civil order. The benefits
to a no deal are of course
that the 2016 referendum
pledge is fulfilled, no
divorce bill as with May’s
deal and the ability for the
UK to make new laws that
would replace or change
those we currently obey
under the EU.
If article 50 is revoked,
larger civil unrest is antic-
ipated along with a rise in
hatecrime.Trustinpolitics
is likely to fall further
given the subversion of
democracy as perceived
by voters, particularly
Brexit voters. However,
life would carry on as
normal, no food shortages
or medical rationing, our
international reputation
and influence would start
to be somewhat restored
and business investment
should return to the UK.
The UK government
could once again turn
its attention to pressing
domestic issues including
rising homelessness,
the NHS funding crisis
and housing shortages.
The backlash from upset
voters is the unknown
variable in the cancel
Brexit equation and so we
must make a judgement
as to whether this newly
built resentment is worth
the economic benefits and
political stability from
staying in the EU, or not.
Whatever they decide,
they must do so soon. The
clock is ticking.

“That means
that the one
and only for
the Prime
Minister is to
change her red
lines”
this happen, but it is worth
comparing the conse-
quences of no Brexit to a
no-deal Brexit.
If no deal Brexit went
through, the UK would
suffer short term disrup-
tion to supply chains for
food, medicine, manu-
facturing parts, seasonal
labour and much more.
Betting agencies have
started taking bets for
the first food item to be
officially rationed by the
UK government. Travel in
and out of the UK would
be made more difficult,
with the EU limiting
UK flights in and out of
Europe and the channel
tunnel is on course to
be closed indefinitely.
Hostility and hate crime
against ethnic minorities
is likely to increase, as
it has consistently since

How Donkey Kong became a trans icon
Harry Brewis, a YouTuber who goes by the name hbomberguy, held a marathon 57-hour
Donkey Kong 64 livestream raising $340,000 for UK trans charity Mermaids, featuring guests
such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Harry will be visiting Imperial this Tuesday...

irst, a bit of
b a c k g r o u n d .
Trans rights are
a controversial
topic in the UK currently
with mainstream newspa-
pers exhibiting some of
the most toxic and trans-
phobic headlines; The
Telegraph recently ran
a front-page story titled
“Trans row as men get
access to women’s NHS
wards”. Not only does this
mis-gender trans women
in the headline, but it is
also a classic fearmonger-
ing tactic that hearkens
back to the days of ‘gay
men are a danger to your
children’ and other such
80s classics. Transphobia
is not exclusive to right
leaning newspapers –
even the supposedly
liberal Guardian ran an
editorial claiming that
the rights of trans women
collide with those of cis
women, despite numer-
ous academic studies
showing otherwise. The
Guardian’s own US
journalists wrote an arti-
cle denouncing the UK
editorial as “advancing
transphobic viewpoints
that are driving attacks on
trans rights in America”.
Clearly, there is a long
way to go to securing
acceptance and rights for
trans people, especially
here in the UK.
This is where things
get a bit weird: a
few months ago, the
National Lottery Fund
announced a £500,000
grant to Mermaids, a
UK charity that provides
mental health support
for transgender and
gender diverse children.
This was met with praise
from the progressive
parts of the political
spectrum, and disdain
from one Graham
Linehan, the creator of
shows such as Father
Ted and The IT Crowd
(yep, we are in a weird
timeline). Linehan,
known as @Glinner on
Twitter, proceeded to
rally transphobes on
Mumsnet (again, it’s a
weird timeline) to spam
the National Lottery
Fund with faux concerns
about the charity
until they announced
they were carrying
out a review of the
grant. Glinner and the
Mumsnet transphobes
rejoiced, thinking they
had won the war. This
is where we finally get
to January 14th
2019 –
enter Harry Brewis.
Hbomberguy is a UK
YouTuber with almost
350k subscribers,
creating videos ranging
from video essays on
gaming, to ‘Measured
Responses’: well-re-
searched videos tackling
the arguments of the
alt-right, the YouTube
‘skeptic’ community,
and even flat earthers.
He is part of a new wave
of YouTubers referred
to as ‘LeftTube’, or
‘BreadTube’ (after The
Conquest of Bread by
Peter Kropotkin), which
includes other creators
such as ContraPoints
and PhilosophyTube,
and is forming a sort of
counter-culture to the
wealth of right-wing re-
actionary content often
found on YouTube.
Last Monday, hbomb-
erguy announced that
he will be livestreaming
a 101% playthrough
of Donkey Kong 64, a
Nintendo 64 game from
1999 that he had never
completed before. In his
announcement video, he
said that in order to spite
Glinner, the livestream
will be raising money
for Mermaids. The
livestream commenced
8:30pm last Friday on
Twitch, with an initial
target of $500. He vowed
that the livestream
would not end until the
game was completed,
unbeknownst of what
lies ahead.
This initial target
was smashed as the
livestream gained
immense popularity. On
Twitter it gained a lot of
traction, with the lives-
tream reaching many
people who had never
even watched a Twitch
livestream before, and
who had never heard
of hbomberguy. Harry
ensured that the event
was not all about him;
with background work
from trans Twitch
streamer Casey Explo-
sion, and with fellow
YouTubers Shaun and
Dan Olson, the stream
became a platform for
voices from the trans
community, both well
known and unknown.
People would join the
Discord call and talk to
Harry and each other
on the stream while he
exasperatedly tried to
beat Beaver Bother,
a minigame in DK64.
Guests included Lily
Madigan, who is the first
trans woman to become a
woman’s officer of a UK
political party (Labour),
and Chelsea Manning,
the former United States
Army soldier and whis-
tleblower who leaked
a wealth of classified
documents and was
sentenced to 35 years
in prison, transitioning
while in prison before
being freed by President
Obama on one of his last
days in office. Natalie
Wynn of ContraPoints
also showed up as part
of the ‘Skeleton Crew’,
a group of YouTubers
hosting conversations
on the livestream
while Harry got his
much-needed sleep.
Guests also included
fellow YouTubers
Oliver Thorn from
PhilosophyTube, Adam
Conover of the Adam
Ruins Everything
webseries, game devel-
oper John Romero, and
Guardian writer Owen
Jones. The stream had
raised $160,000 by
2pm on Sunday, and
was already deemed
a massive success.
However, on Sunday
evening, it was retweet-
ed by more traditional
celebrities such as Neil
Gaiman and Cher, before
reaching and being
retweeted by newly
elected Congresswoman
for New York’s 14th
congressional district,
Representative Alexan-
dria Ocasio-Cortez.
Immediately the chat
went wild with a flurry
of ‘AOC!’ comments ap-
pearing. Ocasio-Cortez
has been a rising star of
the American left since
she unseated Democrat
incumbent Joe Crowley
in a primary election
back in June, and pro-
ceeded to become the
youngest woman ever to
serve in Congress. Her
popularity has only been
boosted by the attacks
on her from right wing
media and politicians
which she expertly
responds to on Twitter. It
was no surprise to see her
popularity amongst this
audience, and shortly
after her retweet she
joined the call and the
crowd went wild. Harry
himself was shocked
that he was conversing
with Ocasio-Cortez 50
hours into a Donkey
Kong livestream.
The livestream ended
on Monday morning
having raised over
$340,000 for Mermaids
in a massive act of
solidarity with the trans
community. It has since
been covered extensive-
ly by the media and has
provided a voice to a
neglected and abused
section of our society.
All expectations were
exceeded, and it will
certainly go down as
one of the best online
moments of 2019.
Harry Brewis and
Oliver Thorn will be
joining the Labour
Society and Left
Forum on Tuesday, at
6:30pm in SAF G16,
to discuss Politics in
the Age of YouTube.
Expect discussion on
this ground-breaking
livestream and more –
you don’t need to be a
member to come. Get
