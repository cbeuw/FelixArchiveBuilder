Fuwa Fuwa: an exact soufflé science
I
f you like delicious
flavours and some-
thing different to fill
your belly (and your
Instagram feed) take a trip
to the UK’s only soufflé
pancake café!
Having first tasted these
fluffy pieces of heaven in
Hoshino Coffee, a chain
with over 150 outlets
across Japan, I was imme-
diately hooked! London I
thought, renowned foodie
destination, was sure to
have somewhere for me to
get my pancakes fix. Sure
enough, there was one
place specializing in these
soufflé pancakes: Fuwa
Fuwa.
The café first set up
shop as a pop-up in West-
field Stratford, but as I
hadn’t gotten my jabs to
explore so far outside of
central London, I waited
a few months for its
expansion. Sure enough
they have now moved to a
more central location, still
in a pop-up style, located
at the Brunswick Centre
just outside Russell
Square station. The
setup is very simple with
minimal decor. Although
cute, it does look a little
barren.
However, being a
pop-up type setting, this
is forgivable, especially
since the quality and
aesthetic of the food
plated up more than
compensates. The menu
consists of sweet soufflé
pancakes, so if you come
here with anyone who
dislikes pancakes, you
should probably reconsid-
er your friendship. It takes
around 20-30 minutes to
make them (unfortunately
longer than most places),
so I recommend you take
some light entertainment
(maybe that lecture you
missed because you were
trekking across London
for pancakes!)
A bonus, however, is
that the cooking takes
place for all to see - the
fluffiest batter is scooped
out and placed onto the
griddle, and then another
is added! That’s right, to
attain the extreme thick
n’ fluffy character, two
scoops are stacked. The
precision-heated griddle
has an infra-red tem-
perature sensor, used to
determine if it is pancake
ready. The whole affair
is very satisfying to
watch and so you should
definitely film this for
your story, because your
375 followers definitely
need to see this important
process ;)
The menu is reasonably
priced, slightly more
expensive than a hipster
milkshake but slightly
less than your average
avocado toast, with the
pancakes costing between
£7.90 and £8.90. The
flavours include a honey-
comb butter with whipped
cream and syrupy
goodness, Banana and
Nutella (need I say more?)
and summer fruit (fruit =
new year new me?). With
so much effort put into the
pancakes themselves, the
toppings are surprisingly
good. The whipped cream
I tried was out of this
world, and the yuzu cream
cheese and blueberry
compote were a flavour
match made in heaven.
The pancake itself, after
20 minutes spent photo-
graphing it for Snapchat,
Instagram, Facebook and
of course LinkedIn, was
finally cut into.
It’s hard to explain its
light and fluffy texture,
but let’s just say that the
NASA scientists who
used the ultra-low-den-
sity Aerogel material to
catch space dust should
probably reconsider their
choice. Despite their
ultra-low density, they are
surprisingly filling! You
will still probably want
another for the amazing
taste.. but let’s be honest,
you can’t afford that on a
student budget.
All in all, highly rec-
ommended - visit Fuwa
Fuwa soon to get your
pancake fix!
Tapioca: your favourite bubble tea ingredient
explained!
Y
ou’ve probably
encountered, or
at least heard
of, tapioca at
some point in your life (at
least if you’ve ever come
close to having boba tea
or tapioca pudding). A
chewy masterpiece, some-
times simply referred to as
‘pearls’, tapioca is in fact
a starch extracted from
the cassava root, a plant
originating from Brazil.
Consisting almost
purely of carbs, it is often
used in a gluten-free diet
as it is naturally free of
this compound. Sadly,
although considered a
staple food for millions
living in tropical coun-
tries, it has basically no
nutritional value, protein
or fibre, and when in the
commonly used black
form, also contains brown
sugar (so you should defi-
nitely make your bubble
tea addiction justifications
on the health benefits of
tea instead!).
So, what are the uses
for tapioca apart from
bubble tea? Bread,
flatbread, a variety of
desserts, or as a thickener
for soups and sauces are
among the most common
(who knew bubble tea
and bread were so closely
related?). An interesting
fact is that many World
War II refugees actually
survived on this ingredi-
ent due to food shortages
in Southeast Asia!
Tapioca is sold dried,
often in the form of a
white flour or flakes,
rather than your typical
pearls, (although this
is also done), and used
for baking as mentioned
above.
All in all, despite being
arguably the most exciting
part of bubble tea, tapioca
processed incorrectly
from the cassava plant can
lead to a compound which
transforms into cyanide –
but hey, what doesn’t kill
you makes you stronger,
right? And as a reward
for getting through this
article, a visit to T4 is
certainly in order.
