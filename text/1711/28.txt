Get your running shoes on, it’s the Hyde Park Relays!
T
he Hyde Park
Relays are the
largest annual
student relays
in the UK and have seen
over 500 competitors take
to the paths of the iconic
Hyde Park in Central
London every year since
1949 to complete 5km laps
in men’s or mixed teams
of 6 and women’s teams
of 4. This year’s edition is
set to be even greater than
previous years!
  Runners of all abilities
are welcome, from experi-
enced racers to complete
beginners.  
This could also be
your chance of meeting
some running legends
as the Hyde Park Relays
has frequently attracted
world-renowned athletes
such as David Moorcroft,
the former 5000m World
Record holder, Sebastian
Coe who won the Relay’s
fastest leg in 1978 then
went on, two years later,
to win the 1500m gold
and 800m silver at the
Moscow Olympics.
  This is also a chance
for university teams to
battle it out against each
other only a week after
the BUCS Cross-Coun-
try Championships in
Exeter...
  Usual suspects
for winning the relays
this year include hosts
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics
Club, local rivals such as
UCL, King’s, LSE and St.
George’s Hospital, as well
traditional rivals Oxford
and Cambridge, Ports-
mouth, Southampton, and
many more from through-
out the UK and Europe.  
Following the race,
all the teams are invited
to join us in the College
for (included!) food and
a presentation ceremony
before the infamous af-
ter-party in H-Bar!
The 2019 edition of
the race will feature: Ba-
ton-integrated chip-tim-
ing ; officially measured
5km course, course map is
on the website (great for a
PB!); inclusive post-race
food ; and the return of the
notorious after-party!  
Entries have opened
and are organised by
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics
Club!
The race will be held
on Saturday 9th February
2019 and will start at
13:00. Registration will
take place in the Union
building between 10:00-
12:00.
  
You will be compet-
ing for the traditional
engraved relay baton
trophies for fastest men’s
and women’s teams and
legs.
However, in addition to
the relay batons, this year
we’ve recovered the Hyde
Park Relays trophy!   It’s
a massive cup, and will
be awarded to the fastest
team whose name will
be engraved on the cup.
Needless to say, this
comes with eternal glory...
   Entries close on the
7th of February, so get
thinking of those witty
team names!   Please go
to Cross-Country and
Athletics Club page on the
union website for more
information, and to buy
tickets.
