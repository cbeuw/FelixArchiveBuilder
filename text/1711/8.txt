The (Oscars’) Favourite
Film Writer Rowan Dixon reviews The Favourite, a serious awards contender. Are mainstream critics wrong about
this seemingly subversive historical drama?
T
he Favourite is
a miss-match
of fish eye vid-
eography, royal
lesbian sex, aristocratic
duck racing and some
kickass wheelchairs. This
film is quite simply all
about who Queen Anne’s
best friend is, battled out
between Sarah Churchill,
the queen’s longest and
closest friend, and Abigail
Masham, a servant from
what was a rich and
powerful family. Through
a mix of gentle verbal
manipulation, oral sex and
good old-fashioned lying,
Masham works her way up
from being a simple serv-
ant to being a close friend
of the Queen. This causes
friction with Churchill,
who is effectively running
the country for Anne and
has devoted her life to
serving her. Anne, as we
discover over the course
of the film (or if you’re
a history buff already
know), has had an incred-
ibly unfortunate life. She
has had at least 17 preg-
nancies, most ending in
miscarriages, and the very
few that were born died
within a few months. To
fill this gap she has many
rabbits, 17 to be exact,
who live in her bedroom
and occasionally steal
the show away from the
main characters. Whilst
the queen is in mental
breakdown and Masham
and Churchill battle out
who is The Favourite,
there is a war going on
between England and
France, which coinciden-
tally is being organised by
Churchill’s husband.
Yet despite strong
acting talent, the film is
let down by its script. The
dialogue is slow and all
the jokes end up falling
flat on their face, literally
in one case. The saving
grace of this film, and the
only reason I didn’t walk
out, was Rachael Weisz’s
character, Sarah Church-
ill. Sarah is one badass
character; she is running
the country, has multiple
politicians in her pocket
“...the acting is
very good and
the costumes
are exceptional
but I can’t
get my head
around how
dull it is.”
“... she is
running the
country, has
multiple
politicians in
her pocket and
is one hell of a
good shot all
whilst having
a perfectly
twisted sense
of humour.”
and is one hell of a good
shot, all whilst having a
perfectly twisted sense
of humour. Weisz’s per-
formance is perfect, she
dominates the screen and,
dare I say, gives a better
performance than Olivia
Coleman. That’s not to
say Colman’s portrayal
of Queen Anne is poor,
far from it— Coleman
plays the part of the
emotionally unstable and
childish monarch in a very
dramatic manner, which
at times is so dramatic it’s
almost amusing to watch.
You may have noticed by
now that there is a theme
going on– no men. That’s
not to say there aren’t any
male roles (there are), but
they have been delegated
to the comical roles and
always have an air of
incompetence. They are
always running around
after the matriarchs of the
film, wearing ‘silly’ wigs
and covered in powder
makeup, subverting the
historical views of 18th
century society.
Writing this review
was hard. On one hand
the acting is very good
and the costumes are
exceptional but I can’t
get my head around how
dull it is, and to make it
even harder I can’t point
my finger at any specific
fault, which leads me to
conclude that my 2 hours
of boredom was due to the
script. I know the script
has already been partially
dictated by history, but
there are so many wonder-
ful historically accurate
films out there that are
such a joy to watch that
I really can’t understand
why this made me want to
leave the cinema and take
the hit on my £7.99 ticket.
That money could have
been spent on something
much better, like any other
film I have seen in the
past year, and I watched
The Room…. If you have
made it this far through
the review then by now
you shouldn’t need me
to tell you to save your
money and go to KFC
instead, but just in case,
don’t bother watching it!
The only reason I would
recommend this film to
anyone is if you want to
hear some swearing, and
you get that for free and
in much more abundance
in the street. There is the
fact that it is pretty histori-
cally accurate in the broad
sense, but what exactly
went on inside the walls
of the palace and how
long some guys last whilst
being jacked off on their
wedding night is anyone’s
guess. If you want to
watch a historical film
then there are hundreds
out there which are
much more exciting and
enjoyable to watch, but if
you want to know more
about the early 1700s save
yourself 120 minutes and
just google it.WW
At least the costumes deserve their awards recognition. // IMDb
