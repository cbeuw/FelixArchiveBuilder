An Homage to Joie De Vivre
I
like it. I just don’t
get it,” my neigh-
bour-turned-philos-
opher laments to her
friend. As the audience
stumbles out of our shared
reverie, the sentiment
is echoed through the
foyer. The performance
was well-executed, from
eerily lifelike puppetry
to the clever weaving of
fairytale themes. But there
was no easy message
offered on a platter to the
bemused, yet amused,
spectators. Thank god!
I attended this per-
formance on the same
evening as the Brexit deal
vote. While media pundits
and armchair analysts
desperately tried to grasp
meaning amid the anarchy
of the night, the Waltz
offered welcome refuge.
Unlike our national eman-
cipation, the performance
offered solace in surreal-
ism, and an escape into
the nostalgia of European
folklore. We were served
an antidote to the miser-
able realism of everyday
life.
The show begins before
the audience has even
found their seats. A figure
wearing a bird mask
slowly feeds string into a
cotton mule, the machin-
ery’s creaks raising hair
and eyebrows alike. She
cocks her head sideways
at passers-by as the lights
dim. As she weaves her
nest, the Waltz of the
Hommelettes begins.
For some, a clear plot
serves as a source of
certainty and safety in
the face of fast-paced,
or introspective, scenes.
Yet, Les Antliaclastes
offer no such guarantee.
Like the frantic mind of
a child, we are ferried
between subplots and
skits, not pausing for
long enough to sink into
philosophical analysis.
Their skill lies not in
explanation, but pure un-
adulterated entertainment.
To do so, they draw on
syncretic Pagan-Christian
mythos and lore. From
the comically macabre
elves strutting across
the shoemaker’s floor
to the pantomime-like
exploits of the Rabbit, we
are treated to elements
of Graham Greene, the
Brothers Grimm, and
Aesop’s fables.
This ballad to tradi-
tional, rural Europe is
also found in the accom-
panying sound. Benjamin
Britten’s ‘Cuckoo’
nests comfortably in the
soundtrack, alongside
the haunting melodies of
Louis Thomas Hardin,
AKA Moondog (the
Viking of 6th
Avenue, a
visionary worthy of more
praise than I have space
for here).
I recall attending a
puppetry workshop at the
Barbican as a child, where
we were taught to incor-
porate as much care and
attention in building the
puppet as we would then
show in our performance.
In doing so, the marionette
becomes an extension of
its invisible master. The
Antliaclastes know this all
too well, as the transition
from actor to puppeteer
lost none of the playful
and esoteric joy.
What, if anything, is
there to ‘get’ from such an
eccentric journey through
folklore? Director Patrick
Sims puts it well in an in-
terview with the Barbican,
where the “alchemical
symbolism” of the tales
skewers the “hypocrisy
of adult logic”, using the
supernatural to wordless-
ly discuss morality. As
children, we all enjoyed
the adventure of tales
and fables, but it is the
wisdom they instilled in
us that allows such stories
to stand the test of time.
Do not go to the Waltz
of the Hommelettes if you
want instant pleasure, an
easy watch, or a jester’s
jig. Go to see centuries
of tradition distilled into
masterful performance,
to enjoy release from the
strains of adult life, and
to rekindle the unspoken
joie de vivre that child-
hood brings.
Art Below Hyde Park
B
y using adver-
tising space in
London’s iconic
u n d e rg r o u n d
stations to showcase
artwork, independent arts
organisationArtBelowhas
two powerful missions:
rendering contemporary
art accessible to millions
of commuters, and
creating a platform for
promising as well as
internationally-renowned
artists to reach novel
audiences. Attending
their latest vernissage
Art Below Hyde Park at
Herrick Gallery in the
very heart of Mayfair not
only gave me the immense
satisfaction of discovering
a hidden gem in London,
but also left me with new
impressions and refresh-
ing perspectives on public
engagement with art.
Art Below’s show
consisted of a variety of
paintings and sculptures,
as well as prints and
drawings made by twen-
ty artists from all corners
of the world. Some of the
exhibited works will be
displayed on billboards
at the Hyde Park Corner
tube station for two weeks
until the 28th
of January to
brighten and sweeten the
commute of an expected
10,000 people.
Stepping into Herrick
Gallery, the black and
white drawings of Mu-
nich-based artist Falk von
Schönfels immediately
caught my eye. His art-
works not only fit perfect-
ly in the urban setting of
the London Underground
but also resonate with
today’s era of hysteria
and continuous frenzy of
fake news. Von Schönfels
combines this madness
with his inspiration from
poetry and esoterism to
produce these outstanding
drawings, captioned with
crazy titles. I will defi-
nitely not forget his art-
works easily and I would
do everything for a t-shirt
with these striking graph-
ics.
Going down the gal-
lery’s staircase, I discov-
ered my favourite piece
of the entire show: Rose
Long’s Babushka. I am
not sure whether it was
the strong and powerful
contrast between dark and
bright colours or Long’s
work with different pat-
terns and textures that
made me fall for this par-
ticular painting. There is
something special about
the look and the gaze of
the depicted girl, who
happens to be the artist’s
mother at the age of five,
that makes you want to
stand in the front of this
painting for ages without
noticing time passing.
Freudian Slip by the
talented Gia Strauss,
which blends controver-
sies around plastic surgery
and the objectification of
women into a distorted
Picasso-like portrait, also
attracted audiences. An-
other crowd-pleaser was
Tim Gatenby’s abstraction
of childhood memories,
Frog Life – a truly unique
mixture of distorted mem-
ories, commercialism and
pop culture.
The showcase of these
and many other original
pieces, together with per-
formances throughout the
evening and free-flow-
ing prosecco turned the
evening into a real suc-
cess. What strikes me
most, however, is the
underlying vision of Art
Below, namely making art
available everywhere and
for everybody. Who says
that art should be some-
thing exclusive behind
closed doors? Why can’t
a tube station serve as a
museum and inspire busy
urban people to appreci-
ate the beauty and value
of art? I was impressed by
the aspiration of Art Be-
low’s curator Ben Moore
to create a vibrant com-
munity of different artists
and taking their art into a
public context. I can only
hope that this will inspire
artists of the next genera-
tion…
If this has awakened
your curiosity, don’t for-
get that you can check out
the prints of several art-
works for free at the Hyde
Park Corner underground
station. Art Below’s is
running another exhibi-
tion called ‘Plei’ from the
24th January until the 6th
of February at the River-
side studio at Re:center in
Hammersmith, with a va-
riety of artworks dedicat-
ed to the concept of play.

Modern Couples: Love and Art in the Modern Age
Exploring the intimate worlds of modern artists.
M
o d e r n
Couples at
the Barbican
Centre is an
attempt to illuminate an
oft-neglected, but crucial
aspect of artists’ lives:
their romantic relation-
ships. We have developed
a preconceived notion of
artists being isolated in
their artistic journeys. We
tend to forget the environ-
ment that nourishes them,
especially love, intimacy,
and passion, which inspire
great art. The pursuit
of love, much like the
pursuit of art, is a tumul-
tuous affair, paved with
the greatest joys and the
deepest sorrows. Modern
Couples shines a spotlight
on the intimate space be-
tween artist couples – how
it changed them, and their
art, in return.
The moment you enter
the exhibition, you get
a sense of peeking into
a clandestine affair. The
exhibition covers the
lives of around forty artist
couples. Not restricted
to any one discipline, it
brings artists from all
walks of life: musicians,
photographers, painters,
sculptors, writers, ar-
chitects, and designers.
The visitors are invited
into their lives through
artworks, photographs,
and excerpts from intimate
letters and other texts. The
exhibition is categorized
into interrelated themes:
Russian Avant-garde,
Surrealism, Bauhaus,
the Bloomsbury Group,
Futurism, homosexuality,
and so forth. The visitors
find artists in different
phases of their relation-
ships and how in turn their
art was influenced. Major
art figures of this era have
been included – Rodin,
Kahlo, Picasso, Dali, Max
Ernst, Klimt, and Man
Ray, to name a few. The
couples are well chosen
by the curators and they
never seem to bore. Each
relationship gives a fresh
perspective and an aware-
ness of the fragile com-
ponents in a relationship
that we take for granted.
From the great love story
of Barbara Hepworth and
Ben Nicholson to the
tragic love affair of Dora
Maar and Picasso, the
exhibition encompasses
the entire spectrum.
An important aspect
that the exhibition tries to
emphasise is the mutually
conducive collaboration
between the partners.
One of the most famous
partnerships is between
Gustav Klimt and Emilie
Flöye. Klimt often in-
corporated the intricate
patterns of Flöye’s
fashion designs into his
paintings. His most iconic
painting, The Kiss, is one
of the finest examples of
the amalgamation of the
arts and fashion. Georgia
O’Keeffe’s paintings
bear a heavy influence
from Modernist pho-
tography, possibly due
to her relationship with
the famous photographer,
Alfred Stieglitz. Often,
the couple worked on
the same subjects, yet
expressed themselves in
totally disparate ways.
For instance, inspired by
Stieglitz’s Songs of the
Sky, No. 2, Keeffe, a year
later, came up with her
dreamy version of the
same landscape. It was
like an intimate exchange
between lovers through
their artistic prowess.
Through their relation-
ships, these couples
explored the true meaning
of love and their own
identity. By illuminating
the collaborations, the
exhibition also brings into
the limelight the many
female artists that had
remained overshadowed
by their male counterparts.
It is interesting how
relationships changed
the fabric of their lives.
Many of these artists
found meaning and
purpose in their lives
during these relationships.
Two examples of this are
Tina Modotti and Nancy
Cunard. Modotti, who had
been an established actor
in America, found fulfil-
ment through photogra-
phy. She became a student
of the famous photogra-
pher, Edward Weston.
The student-master
relationship soon turned
into an affair. During this
phase, Modotti found
her independent voice in
photography and focused
her attention on political
activism, especially in
Mexico.
Nancy Cunard, a
British writer and heiress,
found purpose in her
life after encountering
Henry Crowder, a black
American jazz musician.
Her affair with Crowder
in the early 1900s attract-
ed much media attention
and a storm of hate mail.
This opened her eyes to
the tremendous racial
injustice and oppression
of black Americans. With
the help of Crowder and
other prominent writers,
she went on to publish and
edit a 900-page anthology
on Black history. Her
subsequent life became
a crusade against racism
and exposing the hypoc-
risy of the British upper
class.
One of my favourites
is the room exhibiting
the Lee Miller’s pictures
taken by Man Ray. Miller,
who had been a model
in New York, moved to
Paris to learn photography
from Man Ray. Starting
as an apprentice, she soon
worked as an equal with
Ray. She was his muse
and the great love of his
life. Ray, intoxicated
with love, framed tender
pictures of her, notably
the nudes. Together, they
created and explored new
techniques in photogra-
phy, the most famous
being solarization, a
technique which became
a significant milestone in
photography.
At the same time,
Miller’s more in-depth
pursuit of photography
was demanding greater
independence. Ray could
not endure this and was
soon torn apart following
their breakup. The room
next to this, featuring
Mad Love, exhibits works
created by Ray during
this despair. One of the
prominent ones is the
Indestructible Object (or
Object to Be Destroyed).
The metronome, with
a pendulum bearing
Miller’s eyes, is accompa-
nied by an instruction:
“Cut out the eye from
the photograph of one who
has been loved but is seen
no more. Attach the eye
to the pendulum of a met-
ronome and regulate the
weight to suit the tempo
desired. Keep going to the
limit of endurance. With a
hammer well-aimed, try
to destroy the whole at a
single blow.”
The exhibition loses
its sheen, particularly in
one aspect: its attempt to
cover too many lives in a
relatively small exhibition
space at the Barbican.
Instead of exploring a few
personal stories, it tries
to cover too much. The
visitors, in the end, are
only able to get scattered
snapshots of the couples,
giving a hazy glimpse of
their relationships without
a greater understanding
of their precise nature.
Moreover, the exhibition
does not give equal
weight to all the couples.
Instead, the focus is
commensurate to the
popularity and influence
of the artists. This could
be probably due to limited
resources regarding the
more obscure artists or
just because the lives of
prominent artists attract
more visitors.
There is a feeling of
having visited a secret
society; a dizzy headache
builds up after seeing so
much in a small space.
Modern Couples is a
near unattainable feat, an
ambitious effort to put
together unheard, obscure
personal accounts of the
lives of artists. It surprises,
it enlightens the visitors.
It leaves us wondering
about our relationships in
these current times and
the true meaning of love
and its expression.
