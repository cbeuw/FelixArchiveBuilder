O
n 3rd October
2018, the iconic
British marque
synonymous
with James Bond debuted
on the London Stock
Exchange, a milestone for
the historically troubled
carmaker, with a past
marred by several bank-
ruptcies. The shares were
priced at £19, valuing
the company at £4.3bn.
While most IPOs are tra-
ditionally capital raising
operations, this IPO was a
profit-taking exercise for
its 2 largest shareholders,
Italian private-equity
group Investindustrial and
Kuwaiti investment fund
Investment Dar, who
sold off a quarter of the
company.
Slipping as much as
8 percent on the first
day of trading, the price
has dropped to a current
low of £12.60. Peer-
to-peer lender Funding
Circle, which listed 2
days after Aston Martin,
is down 28% from its
listing price. The poor
post-IPO performance of
2 high-profile flotations
is symptomatic of the
weaker IPO market
inflicted by the spectre of
Brexit, which could herald
a period of low deal flow
as on-going transactions
are reconsidered.
Jonathan Clatworthy,
director of investment
management at Arbuthnot
Latham mentioned the
“challenging valuations”
of the UK market, citing
a lack of track record to
justifytoplevelvaluations.
Aston Martin listed with
the desire to achieve
premium valuations like
luxury brands Hermes
International, LVMH
and Italian rival Ferrari.
A share price of £19
valued Aston Martin at 20
local component suppliers
who cannot keep pace,
prompting Aston Martin
to look overseas for new
partners. With the current
German-made gearboxes
and engines (V8 from
Daimler and V12 from
Ford), three-fifths of
components are imported
from Europe. This move
signals a further reduction
in the “British-ness” of
the brand. Fans of the
automaker, who take pride
in hand-crafting each car
in England, will be getting
a lot less British for their
buck.
CEO Andy Palmer,
who breathed a “sigh
of relief” when briefed
in a late-night call on
the Brexit deal, may
be having a few more
sleepless nights. Prime
Minister Theresa May’s
deal was rejected by the
House of Commons on
15th January 2018. While
Minister May returns to
the drawing board, this
setback leaves Aston
Martin on tenderhooks
as the possibility of a
no-deal exit from the EU
looms closer. An outcome
that does not protect the
UK’s access to the single
market will introduce red
tape and drive up cost by
disrupting the complex
integrated supply chains
that feed the UK’s
automotive industry. With
10% of people employed
in the UK’s automotive
manufacturing originating
from somewhere else in
the EU, such a blow will
hamper the industry’s
acquisition and retainment
of foreign talent.
Carmakers have
cautioned about these
consequences. Jaguar
Land Rover estimates
job losses in the tens of
thousands and intends to
close one of its three UK
plants. Toyota and BMW
have also expressed
intentions to shut their
plants in the aftermath of
the exit. In anticipation
of messy customs,
carmakers have stockpiled
raw materials, with
Aston Martin stockpiling
engines since September
2018. The global market
Aston Martin commands
may insulate the company
from weakness in the
EU and UK, including
the added cost of import
and export tariffs on its
vehicles. However, the
disruption to its European
supply chains could derail
the company’s expansion
plans. It seems Aston
Martin and its UK-based
peers, will just like Bond’s
favourite drink, be in for
quite a shaking.
