brand new addition:
Smash Corner! Where
we will give you weekly
guides on characters from
Nintendo’s Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate, to give
you an overview and
some useful tips about
them. And who better than
Nintendo’s golden boy to
start off this series, fighter
#01 of the roster, Mario.
N i n t e n d o ’ s
mascot made his 1rst
appearance as ‘Jumpman’
in the classic arcade game
Donkey Kong all the way
back in 1981. Ever since,
Mario has remained Nin-
tendo’s most important IP
and appeared in more than
150 games of many differ-
ent genres, ranging from
platformers, sports and
of course fighting games.
As one of the original
8 fighters from the first
entry in Super Smash
Bros. on N64, Mario’s
iconic character and
playstyle has remained
consistent throughout.
He is a powerful close
range brawler of medium
weight and average speed
which has plenty of perks.
Mario really
excels in hand to hand
combat and relies mostly
on his fast and reliable
normal, tilt and smash
attacks to dish out the
damage and eventually
secure the kill. Living
up to his former name of
‘Jumpman’, it is in the air
that he truly shines with
an almost instant neutral,
which you will be using
a lot, and a great up-air
to juggle opponents with.
And of course, Mario’s
bread and butter is his
forward aerial, which
will spike down the poor
player hit by it. Another
strong move of his kit is
his back-throw, which is
a powerful kill-throw at
higher percentages. In
addition, this move will
make Mario spin around
hitting any nearby op-
ponents, handy if you’re
getting attacked from
multiple angles!
His special moves
are however not to be
underestimated as they
give him a huge amount
of versatility. Mario’s
neutral special is his
trusty fireball, that will
interrupt the opponent,
providing the opportunity
to chain in attacks or
combos, if followed upon
quickly. His side special
is his cape, very useful
if timed right to reflect
any projectiles. His down
special is the F.L.U.D.D.,
a charged attack that can
blast opponents with
water, it’s purpose not to
do any damage but simply
to push them away as
they are trying to recover.
And last but definitely not
least, Mario’s up special
is his Super Jump Punch,
which can of course be
used as a recovery but
also as a kill-move for any
opponent overhead.
With all this in mind, a
common combo for Mario
goes as follows: throw
your enemy in the air
with an up-throw, -tilt or
-smash, jump and hit them
with an up-air, repeat the
process with a mid-air
jump and finish off with
an up-special. Depending
on the weight and per-
centage of your opponent,
it can lead to a kill. If not,
all is not lost; you can
always go for the hefty
FORWARD AERIAL
while they are off stage to
send their poor soul down
into oblivion. Be sure to
shout it when doing so for
ultimate disrespect.
All in all, Mario is a
mid-high tier character
which has a lot of po-
tential. A fighter that is
easy to learn, but hard to
master, hence a good first
character to pick if you
are new to Smash and
want to try it out.
Smash Corner - Link, Mute Discount Legolas
O
riginating in
1986 as the not
so eponymous
main character
of ‘The Legend of Zelda’,
Link has grown to be
one of Nintendo’s most
beloved and well-known
characters. Long-time
fans of Link finally get
their justice in Ultimate
as this is truly the best
iteration of Link we have
had yet! Link is one of the
slower characters in the
game, but his high weight
and kill power more than
make up for this. The key
with Link is to use his
variety of projectiles to
force your opponent into
a vulnerable position and
then blast them with your
strong, multi-hit up and
forward smash attacks.
These moves have high
damage and large hitbox-
es, meaning they are very
good at catching out the
enemy as they try to avoid
your plethora of traps.
Link’s neutral special
is his Bow and Arrow.
It is a great zoning tool
with moderate damage,
scaling up the longer you
charge it. A good trick is
to fire one at the ground
and then pick it up, this
lets your next shot fire 2
arrows simultaneously!
Use the arrows to force
your opponent to jump
and punish them with an
anti-air.
His side special, Boo-
merang, can be thrown
in a variety of angles
and distances, filling a
similar role to the arrows.
However, the boomerang
also has a hitbox on the
way back, providing
additional pressure as
Link moves around the
battlefield. It can also be
bounced off the ground,
providing many mix up
options to your playstyle.
Link’s up special and
main recovery option is
Spin Attack. It can be
charged whilst on the
ground to deal a large
amount of damage on
both sides of Link, but
where it really shines is
the large vertical distance
that can be covered with
this. Along with a jump,
Link can now recover
from almost anywhere off
stage!
The bread and butter
of Link’s move set is his
down special, the Remote
Bomb. Using it creates a
remote bomb which can be
detonated again with the
same input (as long as no
one is holding the bomb).
The possibilities with this
move are endless; you can
use it to hit and kill the
enemy off stage or place it
on a platform to limit your
opponent’s movement
options. Alternatively, the
bomb can be placed near
the ledge, forcing your
opponent to jump from
the ledge which can then
quickly be countered with
a forward or up aerial. If
you’re feeling particularly
fancy you can also use
the bomb to hit yourself
off stage to add further
distance to your recovery.
Other important things
worth knowing are that
when standing still, Link
blocks projectiles with his
Hylian shield and when
his health is at 0% his
forward smash also has
its own projectile; a neat
call back to his original
games.
I would place The Hero
of Time securely in high
tier, held away from top
tier only by his unfavour-
able matchups against
the game’s best such as
Palutena and Pikachu.
If you want to learn
more about Link there
are great videos by pro
player ‘ZeRo’ and long-
time Link main ‘Izaw’
on YouTube. Happy
Smashing!
