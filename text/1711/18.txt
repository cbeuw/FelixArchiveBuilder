How science got women wrong
BOOKS

T
he first time I
noticed this book
was when it was
nominated for the
Reading Women Award
for Nonfiction in 2017.
It opens the discussion
on how society affects
gender-related biological
and behavior studies. It
deals with three topics I
am interested in: femi-
nism, science, and history
(and it is also available
in the school library). In
general, each chapter
covers a controversial
topic such as: Are women
inferior to men? Why do
women live longer than
men? These chapters are
self-contained and can be
read separately.
In each chapter, Angela
Saini listed the evidence
supporting both sides
of each topic and made
it easier for the public
to understand scientific
writing in a smooth,
coherent, and story-telling
way. Throughout her
book, Angela Saini em-
phasises on how little we
know about the behavior
and biology of men and
women.
Angela Saini has a
degree in engineering
and is currently a science
journalist. Her first book
was published in 2011:
Geek Nation: How Indian
Science is Taking Over the
World. She began writing
her new book when her
editor asked her to write
about the menopause.
What is the evolutionary
function of the menopause
and why is it that only a
few species, such as killer
whales and humans, expe-
rience it? What interested
her was how the gender
of the scientist would
make them lean towards
different interpretations
of this question. In her
research, she noticed that
male scientists were more
supportive of the male
sexual selection: females
have menopause because
aged females are not
sexually attractive in the
eyes of the males. Female
scientists were more sup-
portive of the explanation
that menopausal females
have strong societal roles
and were needed to help
with the survival of family
members.
Similar bias in the
study of sexual behaviors
were described in the
book. Saini explored
whether such behaviors in
different animals could be
extrapolated to humans.
Some male scientists
believe that in many
species, males are promis-
cuous while females are
monogamous by nature.
One of their explanations
is that females need to
spend more effort and
time for their offspring
than males, so they need
to be picky about their
mates. However, such
views were challenged by
data from other species.
Angela Saini interviewed
the anthropologist Sarah
B. Hardy, who observed
that female Hanuman
langurs mate with many
males to trick them into
thinking they are the father
of her offspring, and thus
stopping the male langurs
from killing the offspring
they did not father.
In October last year,
Saini gave a talk at the
Natural History Museum
on the ‘Missing Half of
Science’ as part of the
NHM Lates programme.
She shared her views on
why fewer women are
in science than men. She
mentioned that women
have been working in
science for a very long
time, but they were not
given proper credit for
their work. During the
19th century, most of
them had to work with
family members and
their publications were
discredited if their names
were on it. Some were
not paid for their work.
She also mentioned that
there are more women in
certain fields of science
such as life sciences and
anthropology because
male scientists of those
fields encouraged women
to enter years before other
fields.
To encourage young
female scientists, she
suggested that the ed-
ucation system should
lead students to think
about the causes of the
imbalance of female role
models in history and why
women were excluded.
One of these causes were
described in her book
- societal perspectives
have a large impact on
science. Angela Saini
looked through the letters
and publications in the
19th century, including
ones written by Charles
Darwin on women being
intellectually inferior to
men. Members of the
scientific communities of
the time believed women
could not achieve as
much as men because
this was in their biology.
Interestingly, the late 19th
century was also when the
first feminist movement
began. Feminists argued
that women could not
achieve as much as men
then because they did not
have the opportunities
to be educated and were
restricted by patriarchal
societal structures and
culture.
Gender is not the only
bias in science. Saini will
further explore how other
societal factors such as
racism, colonialism, and
aboriginal practices shape
science in her next book
Superior: The Return of
Race Science, which will
be published in May this
year.
Angela Saini shared her views on the new research that is rewriting the story of gender in her new book Inferior:
How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That’s Rewriting the Story.

Science fiction authors come to Imperial!
O
n 16th February,
the Imperial
C o l l e g e
Science Fiction
and Fantasy society will
be holding their 36th
Picocon, a yearly conven-
tion and celebration of
science fiction and fantasy
media. This year’s theme
is ‘intrigue’, and three sci-
ence fiction authors will
be in attendance as Guests
of Honour.
Andrew Bannister is
renowned for his spectac-
ular Spin Trilogy, the third
book of which (Stone
Clock) was published
very recently. The Spin
Trilogy is Space Opera at
its finest – the series has
repeatedly been compared
to Iain M Banks’ Culture
Saga – high praise indeed,
and well deserved. Ban-
nister’s talk at Picocon is
set to be equally interest-
ing, and you will not want
to miss it.
Simon Morden is also
coming to Picocon and
has a huge back cata-
logue of excellent books
you may have read. My
own personal favourites
include last year’s One
Way – leaving me very
excited for the release of
the sequel, No Way, just
one week after Picocon
– and Arcanum, which
is in fact more historical
high fantasy than science
fiction as such. Arcanum
is without a doubt the
best historical fantasy
novel I’ve read. Morden
has said he will focus his
talk on the topic of “space
law” and it promises to be
excellent.
The third guest, Gavin
Smith, is best known for
his Bastard Legion series,
although you may also
know him for some of
his very good video game
tie-in novels for games
such as Crysis 3 and
ELITE: DANGEROUS.
The Bastard Legion is
a military science fiction
series which very much
ran the risk of just being
another generic space
marine series, but which
manages instead to be an
incredibly successful and
well-written subversion
of the genre. Following
the adventures and mis-
fortunes of an incredibly
selfish and morally grey
character as opposed to
your typical saint-like
protagonist, the series
provides a very refreshing
change of pace.
Picocon 36: Intrigue
promises to be a brilliant
day, and if you want to
catch the speeches of each
of these guests of honour,
as well as another given
by a game-developer
duo (and plenty more
besides), you should get
yourself a ticket! The
day’s events will be held
mostly in Blackett’s
Lecture Theatre 1 (LT1).
