Female Genital Mutilation: A Hidden Crisis
Millions of women still bear the consequences of this terrible, unjustified surgical operation.
We can prevent that her daughters suffer the same fate.
D
espite in-
creased legal
protections,
FGM is still a
significant issue that af-
fects thousands of women
and young girls in the UK.
What is Female Geni-
tal Mutilation(FGM)?
The World Health Or-
ganisation (WHO) defines
Female Genital Mutilation
(FGM) as ‘procedures
that involve partial or total
removal of the external
female genitalia or other
injury to the female genital
organs for non-medical
reasons’ (WHO 2008).
It encompasses practices
that intentionally remove
healthy normal female
genital tissues.
There are four types of
FGM. Types one to three
correlate with increasing
severity, with three being
the most severe. Type 1 is
termed clitoridectomy and
involves partial or total
removal of the clitoris.
Type 2 is often referred
to excision, and results
in partial or total removal
of the clitoris as well as
the labia minora (inner
folds of the vulva) with or
without the labia majora.
Type 3 is called infib-
ulation and is the most
extreme form of all types.
It involves the narrowing
of the vaginal opening
by cutting, repositioning
and stitching the labia to
create a covering seal.
Type 4 encompasses all
other harmful procedures
to the female genitalia
for non-medical purposes
such as pricking, piercing,
incision, scraping and
cauterisation of the
genital area. Type 4 also
includes labiaplasty,
which is vulval surgery
to reduce the size of the
labia minora often done
for cosmetic reasons.
There are several social,
cultural and religious jus-
tifications underpinning
female genital mutilation
(FGM) practice which
allow its propagation.
FGM is often regarded as
the ‘right of passage’ to
become a woman.
Why it’s an important
issue?
FGM affects over 140
million women world-
wide, and over 127,000
in the UK itself. FGM
can have countless conse-
quences to women, both
physically and mentally.
When FGM is done,
anaesthetic is rarely used,
causing severe pain to the
woman or child. There is
a risk of infection and the
increased transmission of
diseases such as HIV, as
instruments are not steri-
lised between procedures.
FGM is also associ-
ated with obstetric and
gynaecological problems
such as painful periods.
Women are at greater risk
of complications during
childbirth such as excruci-
ating pain and the risk of
haemorrhaging.
FGM can also cause
lifelong psychological
issues such as PTSD and
trauma during intimacy.
If a girl is under 16
and FGM is performed
on her, it is considered
child abuse. If you help or
encourage FGM it is also
against the law in the UK
and you are at risk of up to
14 years in prison.
Who are FORWARD
and what do they do?
FORWARD (Foun-
dation for Women’s
Health Research and
Development) is an
African diaspora women’s
charity that tackles gender
equality issues such as
domestic violence, child
marriage and obstetric
fistula. They have a par-
ticular focus on FGM and
are the leading charity in
the UK on the subject.
FORWARD offers
a range of services for
women affected by FGM,
such as one to one coun-
selling, workshops and
free legal advice. They
also run monthly coffee
mornings where women
can have a safe space
to talk, often bringing
in guest speakers on
different topics that the
women choose each
month. FORWARD can
also help signpost people
to appropriate services
and are willing to come
along as an advocate to
help women in navigating
other organisations such
as the NHS or other FGM
focussed charities.
They also do lots of
work on the prevention of
do we stop it?
It is vital to prevent
FGM before it even occurs
and the best way to do this
is to increase awareness
about it.
This can be done
through education
programs, community
intervention schemes and
showing people that it is
okay to talk about it in the
first place.
There also needs to be
further research conduct-
ed to establish the actual
prevalence of FGM in the
UK as many believe it is
currently significantly
underreported.
Lastly, the government
must see FGM as an im-
portant issue, and needs
to increase funding and
provide more resources
for the fight against FGM.
What can I do to help?
There are many ways
to get involved. You can
help by raising awareness,
speaking out and funding
charities that work to end
FGM.

FGM and raising aware-
ness. They provide ac-
credited training courses
to a variety of profession-
als: social workers, police,
health professionals etc.
They also have a school’s
programme where they
deliver a session on FGM
to school aged children
to help educate them and
prevent further cases. The
community programme
works with both men
and women to train them
to become community
leaders and work with
their own community to
tackle FGM.
What more is need-

halt?
It is clear what an awful
act FGM now is and what
a severe impact it can
have on others. But how
