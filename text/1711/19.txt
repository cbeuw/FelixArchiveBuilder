James Blake’s Assume Form doesn’t quite take shape
W
ith pro-
d u c t i o n
for names
including
Kendrick Lamar, Travis
Scott and Oneohtrix Point
Never under his belt in
2018 one would expect
Blake’s 4th
effort to sound
sublime, but after a few
listens you might wonder
if perhaps he’s spreading
himself too thin. Whilst
there is a lot on Assume
Form to enjoy, from
ethereal lyricism to atmos-
pheric production, there
is something missing.
Nowhere to be seen are the
eerie glitched-out vocals
of ‘If The Car Beside You
Moves Ahead’, a single
released ahead of the
record, while ‘Don’t Miss
It’ provoked him to reject
the “sad boy” label as
“problematic” following
a mixed Pitchfork review.
Assume Form opens
boldly with its title
track; cavernous pianos,
symphonic strings and
Blake’s poetically vague
vulnerability set the
record off on the right
foot. Painting himself
connecting to the world
anew through his lover
(actress Jameela Jamil),
the lyrical themes bear a
glaring similarity to critic
Mark Fisher’s description
of the chronology of his
work: “listening to a ghost
gradually assume material
form… out of the ether”.
James Blake also explores
the insecurities he has
about this new-found
love, “when you touch me,
I wonder what you would
want with me”, giving the
track a bittersweet tinge.
With stuttering percussion
and pitched vocals driving
it through its final leg,
the album itself begins to
assume form.
What follows are
two songs produced by
trap wonderchild Metro
Boomin. The first of
which, a spacey yet
melodic track delivered
largely by Travis Scott,
whose ability to hold a
tune almost excuses his
generic and materialistic
lyricism. Blake’s contri-
bution on a long-distance
relationship slipping
away and Metro’s punchy
production come through
to hold the track together
well. The crowded beat
and repetitive lyrics on
Boomin’s next contribu-
tion ‘Tell Them’ leaves a
lot to be desired, proving
perhaps, that lightning
doesn’t strike twice.
The other two features,
ROSALÍA and André
3000, develop themes laid
out by Blake (personal-
ity-consuming love and
depression respectively)
on their tracks well, but are
let down by production.
The uninspiring beat on
‘Where’s the Catch?’finds
André’s flow awkwardly
static. ‘Barefoot in the
Park’, however, delivers
a hauntingly sweet punch
despite its percussive
stagnation, ROSALÍA’s
voice ornamenting
Blake’s beautifully.
The remainder of the
record finds Blake perhaps
a little too comfortable
behind his piano, with pro-
duction from himself and
Dominic Maker (Mount
Kimbie) struggling to add
anything of note. Songs
like ‘Into the Red’ and
‘Don’t Miss It’ showcase
Blake’s lyrical and
melodic skill in spades,
with a heart-rendingness
that makes their shroud
of bubbling electronics
enjoyable. Other tracks
including closer ‘Lullaby
for My Insomniac’ bring
little in the way of song-
writing to the table, behind
which Assume Form’s
uninteresting production
falls flat.
The critical acclaim of
Blake’s first three records,
with a Mercury Prize and
co-signs from the likes
of Kanye West have,
admittedly set Blake up
for failure. But not to the
degree that can be heard
on ‘Can’t Believe the Way
We Flow’, a track whose
melody could be pleasant
enough, did it not take up
the track’s entire length,
caked in flat digital
reverb.
While James Blake’s
trademark blend of
singer-songwriter and
atmospheric electronics
do produce a few sparks
here, the record has a
few too many duds to
create a cohesive listen.
Production choices or
underdeveloped lyrics
weaken even its best
tracks, often failing to do
its contributors justice,
Blake included.
Kobala Revisited: Afriquoi storm XOYO
A
f r i q u o i
describe them-
selves simply
as an “afro
supergroup” who per-
form “live African dance
music fusing Congolese
guitar + Gambian kora
virtuosity with UK elec-
tronic sensibilities”. Its
band members: Andre
Marmot (on percussion),
Jally Kebba Susso (kora),
Fiston Lusambo (guitar),
Andre Espeut (voice) and
Nico Bentley (production)
certainly live up to this
description in their 2015
album Kolaba.
The name Afriquoi is
inspired by the delightful-
ly expressive mannerism
amongst francophone
West-Africans to add
“quoi” (“what”) to the
end of sentences, best
translated as “innit”. As
band member Marmot
explains, Afriquoi try to
defy categorisation with
their music. As with their
name. “It’s basically
saying it’s Afro, but so
what?”.
Afriquoi have had
several tours and released
several singles but Kolaba
is their first major album.
They DJ-ed at XOYO last
Saturday (21st
) but sadly
did not feature any tracks
from this wonderful
album, so instead I will
try to do justice in this, my
first music commentary,
trying to condense the ex-
perience into a paragraph
for each of their top four
tracks.
‘Kudaushe’
When performing live,
Afriquoi are sure to bring
out their dancefloor hit
‘Kudaushe’. Its powerful
use of African drums
and xylophone makes a
modern take on a tradi-
tional dance.
‘Way Out’
Starting and ending
with some reflective notes
on the kora Espeut tells
us this song is an ode to
“all the riches I have been
blessed with”. The song
climaxes with the lively
refrain “Yes I know”. The
message is to make the
most of any fortune you
may be blessed, appreci-
ate it, don’t dwell and get
on with living.
‘Papa Speaks
Japanese’
A forty second out-of-
body experience complete
with space-age synth, I
feel this piece reflects the
global reputation of Japan
as a futuristic nation. Over
the trippy background of
the synth accompaniment,
the afore-mentioned Papa
takes a plunge at Japanese.
“Wastashiwa-wa-wa”.
‘Fiston 2000’
Named after the guitar-
ist, the line “Move your
body like this” says it all.
This is a fantastic dance-
floor beat to move to with
a nice fusion of traditional
drums and Congolese
guitar.
If you were hoping to
know, as I am, what the
non-English track titles
mean, sadly I cannot en-
lighten you. Researching
this article I discovered
that West African lan-
guages and cultures are
sadly under-represented
online. However, with
Afriquoi, the culture
blending Western themes
are getting out to the
world.

Bad luck for Ben Howard fans
I
t’s easy to forget that
Ben Howard released
an album last year.
It came and went,
with no hit singles and an
understated sound almost
unrecognisable compared
to the cheery beach-folk
of his debut. The nature
of this quiet and under-
discussed release is what
makes the decision to
perform these new songs
almost exclusively so
interesting, and polar-
ising. They’re not what
Ben is known for, and in
Brixton, clearly not what
the majority of the audi-
ence wanted.
Fromthisshowitisclear
that Ben has disavowed
completely the music that
made him famous. On his
newest album the sunny,
earnest melodies and
sing-along choruses of
Every Kingdom make way
for obtuse, poetic lyrics,
unassuming singing, and
gradual builds in intensity
that impact only if you
managed to sufficiently
focus your attention on
the initial quiet, which
at times is no small feat.
With this as his new
sound, it is no wonder
that he did not perform a
single one of the cheerful
campfire songs that made
him famous; their carefree
and direct sound is the
antithesis of what he now
seems to value.
impressed by the focus
on this material, and
omission of the songs
they doubtless bought
tickets to hear. Shouts of
“play the good songs!”,
and audience noise that at
times rivalled in volume
the music coming from
the stage, demonstrated
the lack of patience for the
new material, which unde-
niably requires concerted
effort to appreciate, and
was perhaps not suited to
such a large venue.
There is, however,
something incredibly
bold about disavowing
your old music entirely. It
takes bravery to defy the
wishes of your audience,
to stick to your guns in
the belief that your old,
easy-listening sound is
overly simplistic and
unrealistically cheery. It’s
as if on the first album he
crafted upbeat and blissful
songs that were almost too
good to be true, a sense of
artificiality and idealism
to their sound, and now he
has found more honest art
in realism and subtlety.
Instead of an evening
playing the hits and
giving the crowd what
they wanted, Ben and
his band created a quiet
atmosphere, and one
that required work and
patience to appreciate.
With this show comes an
interesting question; what
do the audience deserve,
having purchased a
ticket? Does their money
purchase the right to hear
exactly what they want to
hear? Or does the artist
have ultimate control,
owing nothing to their
audience, and should be
able to perform what they
believe is most important,
most true to themselves? It
is abundantly clear which
side of this argument Ben
is on, although a vast
majority of the audience
clearly disagreed.
It was admittedly
difficult to focus on at
times, but every song
was beautiful in its own
quiet way, with a few
moments of true, goose-
bump-inducing potency.
And when coupled with
the undeniable honesty
and artistic integrity
of choosing newfound
subtly over singalongs, it
was a gig like few others;
modest, sombre, and with
just enough patience.
Captivating.
The wicked WIZRD of Sauce
F
uture has always
been a hit-making
machine. Earlier
in his career
he adopted (and simul-
taneously established)
a decidedly pimpish
Atlanta trapper sound.
Since then, Future has
achieved ridiculous
international recognition,
the DJ Eskimo tags long
gone. What set him apart
from a Wacka Flaka or a
Jeezy was his consistent
dedication to both authen-
ticity and progression of
the sound. Yes a perfectly
timed Drake consign in
the form of the excel-
lent What A Time To Be
Alive collab project was
significant. But most fans
will tell you that DS2,
released the same year,
or mixtapes like Monster
or Beast Mode released
prior to that, were better
justification for his legend
status.
Modern day Future is
less predictable. It feels as
though the enduring buzz
surrounding his name
owes itself to the social
media obsessives with the
pimp culture his recent
sound has, to some extent,
ironically departed from,
or become a more com-
mercialised version of.
That in itself is not even
a criticism. However,
the resulting effect has
been that the regular filler
tracks or repetitiveness
common in recent Future
projects have become a
sort of elephant in the
room. Having said that,
The WIZRD is pretty
much devoid of either.
The album starts off
with the introspective
and mature ‘Never Stop’.
Future gets real about the
materialism his lifestyle
is soaked in (“I got so
rich, nothing matters to
me”) whilst recounting
the unsteady path he’s
taken to get there with a
triumphent grace. This is
a theme reflected also in
the layered and earnest
‘Temptation’. True,
though Future’s sauced
out bragadocio accounts
for a decent portion of
what we get from this
album, a significant
amount of range is also
demonstrated. As such,
the more simple tracks are
kept effective and short
(‘Rocket Ship’, ‘Promised
U That’, ‘Stick To the
Models’ and ‘Overdose’)
to make way for more
memorable tracks that
are truly unique and
fully formed concepts.
For example, ‘Call the
Coroner’ sees Future spit
a tight verse in a regale
bellow with a slight rattle
to his voice, emulating a
pissed off king. ‘Krazy
But True’ sees Future
speaking on the topic of
recognition with a capti-
vating flow and cadence
over dynamic production
featuring swirling, distort-
ed, high pitched moans.
The most high-energy
production moments
bring out the most savage
moments from Future.
‘Crushed Up’, ‘Servin
Killa Kam’, ‘Faceshots’
are each fairly close to
DS2 level, the last being
the grimiest. Future seems
very aware that it feels
like the soundtrack to a
mustang drift, summa-
rising the aesthetic very
simply: “Skrrt, skrrt in
a fast car”. ‘F&N’ and
‘Baptiize’ are two other
brilliantly produced
tracks, featuring ingen-
ious beat switches. Future
keeps it together over
the gluiding, lil uzi-style
synths on ‘Goin Dummi’
too, a genuinely endearing
and soothing track.
The few features that
appear near the end of the
album certainly contribute
positively. ‘Unicorn Purp’
is a building banger,
though Young Thug
and Gunna somewhat
highjack the track with
their dope back and forth
in the second half. The
Travis feature, though
fairly self contained and
lowkey, is also decent.
Overall, WIZRD does
lend confidence to the
future of Future’s sound.
Clearly, his long and
successful career is by no
means in the business of
winding down.
