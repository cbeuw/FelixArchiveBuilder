T
he Union has
come under fire
for approving
a new society
dedicated to training its
members in the art of tax
evasion.
PanamaSoc, so named
after the infamous Panama
Papers, was apparently
confused for a new
cultural society catering
to Panamanian students
by the New Activities
Committee, and given full
status within the Union.
“We wouldn’t call it
tax evasion,” said Jordan
Bellend, Chair of the
society, “what we do is
more like ‘wealth exten-
sion’. It’s an essential
life skill that simply isn’t
covered in any course
– not even the Business
School’s Accounting
Online course helped!
We’re simply provided a
much needed safe space
for all those interested in
staying wealthy!”
When asked about the
repercussions of such
a society, the Deputy
President (Finesse and
Incentives) shrugged her
shoulders. “Well, they’ve
managed to display
reasonable interest from
students,” said Clarissa
DeCilantro, “I personally
think they’re a great
idea. I mean, what harm
can they do? It’s not like
they’re depriving people
of necessary resources
like healthcare, right?”
The society’s proposed
event calendar includes
a lecture series, ‘How
I Spun This’, featuring
noteworthy tax cheats,
and an annual ‘Taxathon’,
where individuals are
put into teams to hide as
much money in offshore
accounts as possible for
their clients.
The decision comes as
two of the Union’s biggest
financial societies have
been placed on probation,
after their annual budgets
revealed suspicious cash
flows to Southern Ameri-
can companies.
Union officials are
investigating the books of
Finance and Investment
Societies, which were both
noted to be late in submit-
ting their budgets by the
deadline this Monday. It
is suspected both CSPs
were funnelling money
The next Mossack Fonseca could be an Imperial startup // Imperial College
out of the Union to avoid
the 20% VAT being taken
from their accounts.
“We were hoping to get
a trip in to Bangkok next
year,” said Ronald Hora-
tion, president of Finance
Society, “we’ve heard they
have a thriving, ‘business
community’ over there;
clearly in line with our
aims and objectives!”

C
haos erupted
at this week’s
Union Council
as elected
student volunteers threw
hands and hardware
over multiple proposed
changes to their official
role titles and descrip-
tions.
The initial paper,
proposed by Union
President Job Humphries,
proposed redistribution
of the remits of the other
Officer Trustees. One
notable change saw the
DPFS become Deputy
President (Fine Arts and
Sequinning), in charge
of choosing which paint
colours to decorate the
floors at the new White
City Campus.
Further proposals
would see the removal
of the annual budgeting
system, with the DPCS
focused solely on room
bookings. Jim Heffner,
Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies), enraged
by suggested changes,
reportedly screamed, “not
my budgets, you bitch!”,
before throwing the first
punch at Job, resulting
in a free-for-all fracas
amongst the other OTs.
Halibut Walliams,
Plutocracy Co-ordinator
for the Union, was said
to have run round in rage,
throwing voting pads at
individuals in an attempt
to get them to continue
voting so she could go
home. “This broke-ass
Union doesn’t pay me
overtime, so all you fools
are gonna press vote A, B,
or C now!”, she was heard
saying.
In a separate but related
incident, security was
called to the RSM after
Hailey Gout, non-faculty
Student Reprehensible,
attempted to jump GSU
President Zute Shiermann
outside of the meeting
premises, after a brief spat
in the chamber over a pro-
posed cull of the Business
School.
Eyewitnesses to the
assault claim that Zute
incited the violence,
saying, “well it’s not my
fault you’re in a non-ex-
istent faculty – next time
do a relevant degree!”.
Following this, Hailey
was said to reply with
language not suitable for
print, before yanking a
laptop charger out of the
wall and throwing it at
Zute’s forehead.
The disarray of Council
was paired with the news
that failed negotiations
between the Union and
the College to secure
back payment of bursary
for students beginning in
2017 resulted in a 250%
tuition fee increase for the
next academic term.
