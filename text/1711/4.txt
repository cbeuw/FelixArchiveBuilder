Who should vote on what?
Comment editor Charles Titmuss argues that voters are not to blame for poor political
outcomes

The Brexit vote has
been in the zeitgeist
for the past month as
everything comes to
a head. I humbly ask
the reader to cast their
minds back to that rosy
day on the 23rd of June
when the nation voted
inconclusively for some-
thing to do with Europe.
Although much atten-
tion has been paid to
the way the nation voted
and who voted for what,
we are still questioning
who exactly we should
blame/ congratulate for
this political outcome.
Winston Churchill
once said “the best
argument against de-
mocracy is a five-minute
conversation with the
average voter.”Although
we shouldn’t necessarily
listen to the words of
a saviour-of-the-na-
t i o n - c u m - g e n o c i d -
al-white-supremacist,
these words feel
particularly relevant
today. In the present
day we are bombarded
by a constant stream
of commercial and
political propaganda,
that we accept or reject
based on our internal
biases. The merging of
truth and opinion into
a horrific parody of
reality is something that
we encounter on a daily
basis. This is particular-
ly dangerous in a polit-
ical system that relies
on fact and truth as the
fundamental political
currency. One concept
bandied around by Im-
perial’s most obnoxious
is qualified voting.
Qualified voting is
the concept that people
should only be granted
the vote if they satisfy
certain requirements.
Previous forms of qual-
ified voting have been
used deny people suf-
ferage on the grounds of
racial, social or sexual
inferiority or that those
without property had no
investment in the nation
and therefore no right
to run it. In the modern
day, qualified voting
exists solely in the form
of an age and citizen-
ship metric. One must
be over 18 to exercise
the right to vote in the
UK. This is justified
based on the claim that
anyone below the age
of 18 lacks the mental
capacity to comprehend
the complex issues of
the day, despite the fact
that the implications of
political decisions taken
may have far more ram-
ifications for them than
someone older.
This raises the
question, if intellectual
maturity is apparently of
most concern, should we
restrict the right to vote
based on intellectual
capability? Although I
have heard this question
answered in the affirm-
ative by many of the
particularly insufferable
mouth-breathers around
campus I do not believe
that this is an appro-
priate answer. For one
thing there is the chal-
lenge of where exactly
to politically amputate
the un-enlightened, and
for the other, there is
the question of morality.
Discriminating based on
intellectual achievement
represents a frightening
extreme of meritocracy.
Just because someone
lacks intelligence does
not mean that they
are not impacted by
decisions taken on their
behalf. They deserve
the right to vote for that
reason alone.
However, although
I believe everyone has
the right to express
an opinion I do not
necessarily believe that
all opinions are created
equal. Several disingen-
uous politicians, such as
David Davis, have been
pedalling the idea that
everyone is an expert.
This appeals to the in-
dividualist cult that we
all happen to belong to
nowadays, but in reality
most opinions matter
about as much as a whelk
in a supernova. With the
media cycle being a few
hours at best, different
highly complex issues
are birthed, discussed
and then die so rapidly,
there is simply not
enough time for individ-
ual voters to formulate a
meaningful overview of
the entire system. There-
fore, there must be a
reasonable solution that
prevents misinformation
and the misinformed
from unduly impacting
democracy without re-
stricting voting access.
I would argue that
the best solution to the
problem presented is to
restrict what people vote
for. Instead of the broad
in/ out question that was
posed to the electorate
with Brexit, it makes far
more sense to limit voter
options similarly to the
process of voting for a
party in representative
democracy. The options
of mad, bad, sad, crazy,
racist, commie, Scottie
and Irish allow the voter
to select a horse and bet
on it. This is in direct
opposition to a blind,
undefined leap in the
dark, as was allowed
to occur in the EU in/
out referendum. Am-
biguity was built into
the question as Remain
assumed they would
win, and therefore would
never need to answer the
question whilst Leave
required the question to
be as simple as possible
to unite the different
Brexit factions to stand a
chance of winning. This
has led us to the point
where an unsatisfactory
deal has been negotiated
by an unpopular Prime
Minister. Only time
will tell if we crash out
of the single market
not wearing a safety
harness.
To return to the point
of this article, clearly
defined objectives
are a must in any life
undertaking. Instead
of debating an in/out
question, it should have
been carried out in a
similar manner to a
general election, with
multiple campaigns
proposing differing
options for the future
relationship with the
EU. Defined objective
referenda have been
shown to provide a
satisfactory outcome in
many legal independ-
ence campaigns (sorry
Catalonia) as well as for
isolated issues, such as
gay marriage in Austral-
ia and abortion rights in
Ireland. Applying refer-
enda to an obscure and
complex issue such as
the extent of our mem-
bership with the EU was
inappropriate and has
only served to provide
a confirmation of our
lack of certainty of what
our relationship with the
continent is supposed to
be. No referendum at all
would have been better.
