Are we nearing the last stages of the Apple wave?
Apple sells fewer iPhones every year despite consistent revenue growth

A
pple - the one
phone brand
e v e r y b o d y
knows. Even
if you haven’t owned an
Apple product in the past
decade, you have probably
seen somebody in Hyde
Park taking a selfie with
their new iPhone XR or
the person sitting next to
you in the library on their
MacBook Air. Ever since
2007, Apple has enjoyed
a wonderful decade as the
King of Smartphones after
usurping Nokia for that
title. Indeed, Apple was
one of the driving forces
behind the smartphone
boom in the market,
making it a household
name. For the past couple
of years, however, the
smartphone market
started to stagnate, which
posed a problem for many
phone companies. Apple,
however, seemed to defy
the trends by showing a
steady growth in revenue.
And yet, two weeks ago,
the company “stunningly
slashed its own revenue
forecast for its first fiscal
quarter that ended in
December”, resulting in a
stock plunge of 10% - the
worst the company had
ever seen in six years.
It was revealed that,
despite the continual
revenue growth over the
years, Apple had actually
been selling fewer and
fewer iPhones. The reality
is that Apple saw a peak in
iPhone unit sales in 2015
and that Apple sold 14
million fewer phones than
it did three years ago. One
might ask - how was there
revenue growth if fewer
models were sold? The
answer - hiked prices.
Technology always
gets cheaper over time.
In 1984, Motorola sold
the first mobile phone for
$4000, whereas now the
average price of a handset
is $320, according to IDC,
a research firm. Apple,
however, bucked the
trend. To hide its stagnat-
ing growth, they hiked up
the prices for the newer
iPhone models to continue
generating revenue. Due
to their loyal fan base,
this stalling tactic was
sucessful. However, it is
clear that there is only so
much they can hike up
the prices. Realistically,
would you be willing to
pay $1,500 or $2,000 for
an iPhone when you can
also get a smartphone
that’s much cheaper with
the same functionalities
from Samsung or Vivo?
Last November, they
said that they will not be
releasing unit sales figures
anymore, which is very
indicative of exactly how
hot the water they have-
landed up in is.
The company blamed
“a slow economy in
China and the trade
skirmish with the U.S.
for worse-than-expected
consumer transactions in
the region that includes
China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong”. CEO Tim Cook
also told stockholders in
a letter that iPhone sales
were on a decline due to
changes in the smartphone
market and consumer
behaviour - information
that should have been
already own old iPhone
models and will upgrade
by buying the latest
one on the market. This
was attributed to many
factors, such as: economic
weakness in some coun-
tries, people using their
smartphones for longer
periods of time due to the
halt in subsidies from the
mobile phone companies,
the rising iPhone prices
and the lower-cost battery
swaps, slowed down
economic conditions in
China in the second-half
of 2018 and the shopping
traffic being hurt by the
uncertainty surrounding
the U.S.-China trade war,

Apple’s China business

It is important to note
that this doesn’t mean
that Apple is currently
crashing and burning,
as it is obvious from
growth charts that they
are generating enough
revenue and cash-flow to
be envied by anyone in
the corporate world. What
it does mean, however,
that Apple broke the “No.

company” - honesty and
openness with investors
about the progress of the

face the consequences.
