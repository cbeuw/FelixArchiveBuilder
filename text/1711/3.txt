T
he South Kens-
ington Campus
has a rich histo-
ry. The campus
today, founded mid-19th
Century, has buildings
with diverse origins –
the Queen’s Tower built
during Victorian times;
the Royal School of
Mines built in the Ed-
wardian era; construc-
tions in the 1950s that
nearly doubled the size
of the campus; modern
additions including the
Imperial College Fac-
ulty Building and the
Business School.
The increasing College
population has led to eval-
uations of how the South
Kensington Campus
should be refined to ac-
commodate this growth.
In the autumn term
of 2017, over 550 staff
and students of Imperial
College were asked to
participate in a consulta-
tion of the South Kensing-
ton Campus; participants
were asked to draw a map
of the campus based off
memory. A masterplan of
the future of the South
Kensington Campus
has been developed by
architect firm Allies and
Morrison based off these
consultations.
The South Kensington
Masterplan is an all-en-
compassing plan that con-
siders the improvement of
nearly all shared spaces
on campus. The consul-
tations revealed that most
people interact only with a
small area of the campus
at which they are already
based, and are unfamiliar
with the College grounds
beyond that. This is an
imbalance that will be
addressed by making the
shared spaces between
buildings more accessible
and appealing, to allow all
parts of the campus to be
enjoyed by all people.
Projects in the Mas-
terplan vary in terms of
impact, ease of implemen-
tation, and investment.
The short-term projects
include the development
of the Sherfield Walkway.
The consultations re-
vealed the difficulty of
moving around campus,
with part of the problem
coming from the narrow
Sherfield Walkway, which
becomes heavily congest-
ed during peak hours of
the day. The Masterplan
involves opening up
the Walkway and other
routes, increasing space
and better access, and
adding improved signage.
The Queen’s Lawn
has long been thought
of as the heart of the
campus, and steps have
already been taken as
part of another short-term
project to improve the
space. The new Dangoor
Plaza will be a courtyard
that stretches across the
Sherfield Building and the
Skempton Building area,
where Queen’s Lawn cur-
rently spans. The Dangoor
Plaza is planned to be a
welcoming green space
with areas for campus
activities year-round. The
funding for this project has
been generously provided
by the Dangoor family’s
Exilarch’s Foundation.
Wohl Reach Out Lab.
Though opening up
space in public realms is
clearly central to the Mas-
terplan, other improve-
ments to shared spaces are
also included. Improved
finishes are considered for
Dalby Court and Sherfield
Walkway; spaces that
are arrival points for the
public, such as Imperial
College Road and the
Main Entrance, will be
reimagined to enforce a
“sense of arrival into the
campus with a feeling of
welcome”. It considers
the development of Impe-
rial College Road into a
primarily pedestrian area,
as opposed to the vehicle
dominated space that it
currently is, which would
allow it to be a potential
space for the weekly
Farmer’s Market and the
Imperial Festival.
The long-term projects
include developments to
the Chemistry Building,
the Sherfield Building,
and expanding the Main
Entrance.
Neil Alford, Associate
Provost (Academic
Planning), states, “The
Masterplan is an ambition.
It’s a vision for the best
version of the campus we
can imagine. We shelve
considerations of cost and
other practicalities for a
moment, and just think
about what we’d really
want our campus to look
like. This then provides a
framework that helps us
as we move forward with
our development plans for
the campus as investment
becomes available."

I
mperial College
Netball Club
(ICUNC) have
teamed up with
societies across Imperial
to bring you a week jam
packed with events, with
everything from talks on
cancer symptoms (de-
livered by our very own
students) to an infamous
ACC night (did someone
say Snakebite?) with
an ICUNC twist. The
week is all about getting
educated on cancer
symptoms, how to check
for them and when is a
good time to pootle on
down to your GP just to
get it checked out. We
want to get rid of the
taboo of cancer chats, it
doesn’t have to be scary
or sad, it can be simple
and light hearted too!
you never really talk to
or a school teacher you
can’t really remember;
sometimes it’s a bit closer
to home - a grandparent,
a family friend, maybe a
parent. Regardless of who
it is, that doesn’t change
the irremovable fact that
the C-word is one of
those things that everyone
lowers their voices about,
and can only be discussed
with sombre tones and sad
expressions.
I know that, because
that’s what happened to
me. But rather unexpect-
edly, it wasn’t a random
family friend. It was
Lauren. Andy, our lovely
Editor-in-Chief, wrote
about Lauren Dennis
back in October, just after
she passed away after an
18-month fight with small
bowel cancer. Lauren
was my best friend, my
housemate, and probably
the best Goal Keeper our
netball team had acquired
in many MANY years
- she’d disagree but it’s
true.
Lauren was 23 when
she passed away.
I didn’t really know
anything about cancer
before she was diagnosed.
I knew the basic stuff that
everyone knew about:
lumps are bad, you lose
your hair, and the treat-
ment is called chemo? But
I knew next to nothing
about the breadth of
cancer, not a clue about
what symptoms would
manifest themselves as,
let alone how to check for
them!
Early detection of
nearly all types of cancer
increases survival rates.
When I did the research,
the statistics were stagger-
ing:
More than 9 in 10
bowel cancer patients
will survive the disease
for more than 5 years if
diagnosed at the earliest
stage.
More than 90% of
women diagnosed with
breast cancer at the ear-
liest stage survive their
disease for at least 5 years
compared to around 15%
for women diagnosed with
the most advanced stage
of disease.
It seems mind blowing
that these statistics exist,
yet I’ve still never heard
anyone telling their pals
on the bus about how they
checked their boobs for
lumps last night, or they
went to see their GP just
to figure out that unex-
plained weight-loss.
The answer is simple:
Let’s talk about it. Let’s
talk about our bodies,
let’s talk about any weird
things we notice, and let’s
talk to our GPs. Then
maybe that nightmare
diagnosis doesn’t have to
end in hushed conversa-
tions, and sad glances at
you every day, but instead
popping champagne at
that last clean scan, and a
long, happy, healthy life.
So how can you get
worthwhile charities.
Giving to charity and
pints? Win win really.

Netball Funday
ICUNC bring you the
annual Netball Funday.
Get yourselves into teams
of seven (no previous
netball experience re-
quired – seriously, you
don’t even need to know
the rules) and come on
down to Kennington Park
to play a bit of netball with
your mates. Fancy dress
and beers are encouraged.
It’s £3 per person, with
all proceeds going to the
Alexandra Sales Trust.

Come join us for as
many, or as few, events
you can muster. This
week is all about integrat-
ing Cancer Chats into our
daily lives. It doesn’t have
to be scary if you know
you’re all checked – check
yourself before you wreck
yourself. Get talking to
your friends about those
embarrassing details,
ask them if they’ve been
feeling okay lately. Find a
weird lump, a weird rash?
Don’t worry, just pop
down to the health centre
and get it checked out.
99.9% of the time it
won’t be anything – but
that 0.1% is lifesaving.
