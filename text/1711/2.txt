T
uesday’s Union
Council saw the
announcement
of £250k fund-
ing secured for “unfairly
underfunded” 2015
bursary cohort students.
This represents the
latest update in an
ongoing saga following
the Union’s request for
reimbursement for under-
graduate students from
the “squeezed middle”
£35,000 - £60,000 income
brackets that were on the
heavily criticised 2015-
intake bursary scheme.
The Union requested
that the affected students
receive reimbursement
for the 2016-17 academic
year and for this funding
to be guaranteed for
the remainder of their
degrees.
The £250k funding
pot will not be directly

available to those affect-
ed. Limitations placed on
what the money can be
used for include money
being put towards Under-
graduate Research Op-
portunities Programmes
(UROPs) and Careers
services. Medical students
affected will also be able
to put the money towards
overseas electives.
This development has
been described as a “high-
light” and a “big win”
by the Deputy President
(Welfare), Becky Neil,
and Rob Tomkies (Presi-
dent of Imperial College
Union), respectively.
However, with the
majority of the affected
students having either
graduated or currently in
final year, this resolution
has been seen by some
as unsuccessful. One
affected student remarked
that this only represented
College succeeding in
“waiting out” the affected
students.
The Imperial bursary
works by providing
financial support on an
annual basis to Home
undergraduate students
with a household income
of up to £60,000. The
sum awarded depends
on the income bracket,
and varies depending on
which bursary scheme the
individual is on.
There are different
bursary schemes for dif-
ferent years of enrolment
at Imperial. In December
2016, it was revealed that
higher income brackets
(from £35k to £60k) saw
a sharp drop in funding.
This meant that, under
the 2015 system, students
from lower income brack-
ets (through a combination
of higher maintenance
loans & grants from SLC,
and a higher Imperial
bursary) received more
than the annual living
costs at Imperial (esti-
mated at £11,522), while
students from higher
income brackets who still
qualified for the bursary
received substantially
(~£2-4k) less than the
living costs.
Following this, College
decided to change the
bursary scheme for the
2016 intake, giving far
more to higher income
brackets in a move widely
seen as acknowledgement
of the inadequacy of the
2015 bursary scheme. Al-
though this was described
as “commendable” by the
Union, it was also noted
that affected students that
were left under the 2015
bursary scheme had been
“overlooked” as nothing
had been done to improve
their financial provision.
The change to the
2015 bursary scheme was
initially thought to have
affected up to 200 under-
graduate students from the
2015-16 cohort - students
who would have received
substantially larger bur-
saries had they enrolled
either a year sooner or a
year later.
Allstudentswillreceive
an email explanation and
the affected students will
receive details of how
they can claim the prom-
ised funding.

Ohhh we're halfway there (-ish)
H
ow time flies!
This week
marks my
14th
issue as
Editor-in-Chief. With
29 issues in total, that
means this week's Felix
marks the (nearly) half-
way point. You'd think
by this point I would
know how to write an
Editorial. Nope...
This week I found out
that people actually read
this Editorial. Someone
even tried to make some
sort of inside joke about
it with me. The joke flew
over my head. All jokes to
do with my Editorial will
fly over my head because I
don't even know what I'm
writing. In future, refrain
from making jokes about
it with me. Even better,
refrain from reading the
Editorial in the first place.
That would be great,
thanks!
It's currently 9.30pm,
which means it's the ear-
liest I've ever written my
Editorial! We edge ever
closer to that 7pm target.
This week, I also finally
got a book (Untold History
of the United States by
Oliver Stone and Peter
Kuznick) and bought a
gym membership, which
means that, only 22 days
after my "gym three times
a week" and "become
more well-read" New
Year's Resolutions, I've
finally got my 2019 (and
my life) in order. Small
victory but we move!
At 40 pages, Felix
this week is a bigger boi.
In the News, we have
the Union's inaugural
Liberation & Community
Week. I had the pleasure
of speaking at Monday's
launch event, which was
a panel discussion. I
must admit it was quite
intimidating answering
the question "what have
you done to advocate for
change", whilst sitting
beside people that have
dedicated years of their
lives to championing
diversity. I managed to

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
come up with something
better than "I exist"
though and someone even
complimented me on "my
continued work as an ad-
vocate for change". Guess
I'm doing something right.
In all seriousness, the
continued conversations
around equality and di-
versity are necessary and I
applaud our DPW, Becky,
for all the effort she put
in to making this week a
success.
We also had Union
Council on Tuesday
evening, which was as
riveting as ever. There
was a lot of discussion
around name changes but
we did manage to spin
quite a major story out of
one of the developments
from Union.
Last, but not least, next
week sees Cancer Aware-
ness in Young People
Week (CAYP). This is
really significant and I
can't commend Fil and the
IC netball team enough
for all their hard work.
They've arranged a week
of events with the aim of
normalising conversations
around cancer in young
people. It doesn't have to
be something scary that is
only discussed in hushed
tone and I urge as many of
you as possible to engage
with as many of the events
as you can next week.
More details can be found
on the IC Netball team's
Facebook page.
Finally, massive shout-
out to Rhidian and Chimdi
for baking and keeping
the Felix team well fed
this week. Section of the
week goes to Arts for
getting back on top with
a MASSIVE six pages!
Congrats!

wholeheartedly disagree
with the harsh 2.5 star

ibility of this publication.
about his work in diversity
and inclusion, which has
spanned over 20 years. He
also spoke about his belief
that it should be perfectly
normal business practice
to discuss diversity and
inclusion and how it has
always been important to
him to push the subject
matter.
The speakers were
asked, “what does diver-
sity in STEM look like?”,
to which panellist Dr. Jess
Wade (research associate
in the Department of
Physics) responded, “The
students at Imperial are
diverse but their teach-
ers and those in senior
positions do not reflect
the student make up”.
Towards the end of the
discussion, the topic of
allyship was raised:
“Being an ally is all
about trying to ensure
everyone’s voice around
you is being elevated and
listened to.”
This topic proved to
be an area of debate, with
Professor Welton admit-
ting he doesn’t “like the
term, ‘ally’” because “we
shouldn’t be applauded
for being supportive and
inclusive of everyone; it’s
something we should be
doing anyways.” Another
panellist commented:
“It’s important to re-
member that allyship is
not about speaking over
other people, but listen-
ing to their experience
and making sure they’re
heard.” Attendees were
also advised on being an
effective ally:
“Speaking up is the
first challenge. If you’re
not knowledgeable about
other people’s challeng-
es, you need to educate
yourself and make your-
self aware”, shared one
panellist, later adding,
“make an effort to learn
about other people. From
there you can help others
and make progress.”
This debate led to a
further question on the
topic of quotas, which
also proved to be an area
of debate. The importance
of everyone fully listening
to people’s experience and
not just focusing on hitting
quotas when it comes to
tackling diversity was
stressed and one of the
speakers added, “I think
quotas are essential, but
they don’t really address
the root issue”. Another
speaker noted:
“Equality and equity
needs to be considered.
We all need to be treated
fairly.”
Following the launch
event, Liberation & Com-
munity Week continued
with a social media cam-
paign.
The term "liberation" is
defined as the seeking of
equal status and freedom
from all forms of oppres-
sion. “It’s the inclusion
of everyone. Everyone’s
thoughts should matter.
It’s all about listening
and enabling people to
speak up”, commented
one panel member at
Monday’s event.
Imperial College Union
has eight Liberation &
Community Officers who
each represent students
within their Liberation
& Community Zones.
Liberation & Community
Officers are volunteers
elected by the student
body in our Leadership
Elections. Felix is looking
to collaborate more
with the Liberation and
Community Officers to
promote diversity and
inclusion, ensuring the
paper acts as the voice
of students and that all
students are heard from.
