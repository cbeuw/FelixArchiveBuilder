Real men care about the environment
T
oxic masculinity
is currently a hot
topic, wearing
many guises –
this was most recently
highlighted in the new
Gillette ad campaign on
the subject. This advert
has caused great contro-
versy. resulting in many
people admonishing
Proctor and Gamble, for
standing up to toxic mas-
culinity. Many people are
also threatening a boycott
of their products, because
the idea that people (men,
especially) should take
accountability for their
actions is so offensive,
obviously.
I want to talk about how
this idea of masculinity
translates into a general
disregard for the environ-
ment when it comes to
men. Now, don’t get me
wrong, I don’t mean all
men. This is not an attack.
The way we are socialised
to perform our genders has
negative consequences
across the board – but the
environment is an aspect
that is often overlooked
and could do with a little
light shed on it. A lot of
traditionally ‘female’
practices are also terrible
environmentally, but
that is another topic for
another time [see “How
Trashy is your Period?
Felix 1906”].
I have so many
memories of having very
one-sided conversations
with the men in my life
- about recycling, eating
less meat, or basically
anything that would be of
a benefit to the environ-
ment. And the problem
is that they don’t think
they should or need to
care, because that is what
women do – care. Or at
least, that is what a lot of
people think.
Again, let me say this
is not all men – but there
have been a number of
studies looking into this
phenomenon. Men have
been found to be more
likely to litter, recycle
less, and have a larger
carbon footprint than
women. This is all due
to the ‘green is feminine’
idea. Both men and
women were found, in
a 2016 study by Brough
et al., to believe that
2018: A big year for the vegan movement
L
ast Tuesday (15th
of January),
Environmental
Society, VegSoc
and APES collaborated
to host a movie screening
event for the film VEGAN
2018. Out of curiosity I
attended. I came out of
it feeling a mixture of
emotions - partly over-
whelmed by the density
of the information, partly
empowered to know that
I could immediately start
making small changes
in my own lifestyle, and
partly regretting that I
hadn’t attended more
movie screenings like
these.
VEGAN 2018 intro-
duced various aspects of
the explosive growth in
veganism last year. An
increasing percentage of
people have begun to cut
out meat from their diets
and gradually incorporate
more environmentally
friendly ways of eating. In
fact, especially around this
time of the year, people
may be participating in
Veganuary - an event
launched to encourage
eating a plant-based diet
just for one month. The
Januaryof2018brokenew
records with an estimated
167 000 people taking
part, grabbing a lot of at-
tention from the media. In
the US, a company called
‘Beyond Meat’ carried
out extensive research on
product development of
plant-based meat patties
- in some regions of
Southern California their
products were outselling
actual meat patties.
London is also a growing
hub for vegetarian/vegan
diets, with vegetarian
options available in most
restaurants, and entire
sections of major stores
such as Tesco and Sains-
bury’s dedicated to vegan/
vegetarian meals. There
is expanding research and
development in producing
meat-free, ‘mock meat’
products which could help
society transition more
easily into a plant-based
lifestyle. The global
trend towards increasing
awareness of veganism,
combined with influenc-
ers (including athletes and
celebrities) promoting a
plant-based diet meant
many businesses began to
view this as an opportunity
to incorporate it as part of
their products. 2018 saw a
significant improvement
in the way mainstream
industries began to take
up veganism.
However, the film
is perhaps overzealous
when talking about
the imminent rise in
veganism. Coming from
an Asian background, I
am also aware that the
spread of veganism in the
UK and US is certainly not
representative of the entire
world. Countries such as
China, Japan and many
parts of South East Asia
still eat meat as a predom-
inant proportion of their
meals. Vegetarian/ vegan
options are definitely not
as readily available as it is
in London. Therefore, it is
important to acknowledge
that there is still a long
way to go in terms of a
global shift towards plant-
based eating, that will take
many more years.
Nonetheless, getting
the opportunity to watch
this film undoubtedly
made me more aware
that every time we have
a meal, we are making a
choice - and for people to
make a choice, they must
be properly informed.
Film screenings like
these are an extremely
approachable way to gain
new knowledge so that
we can make informed
decisions that have the
potential to help the
environment. If you’re
interested in attending
future screenings, make
sure to keep up with the
Environmental society on
Facebook/Instagram, so
as not to miss out on other
free events.

men engaging in ‘green’
behaviours were more
‘feminine’ than those that
didn’t. This concept spills
over into the perception
of ‘green’ products – the
eco-friendlier version
of a product was seen as
more feminine. This study
also looked into the way
that men who feel emas-
culated will compensate
by engaging in behaviour
that is distinctly not
environmentally-friendly.
So, undermining a man’s
masculinity could result
in direct harm to the envi-
ronment.
Ever wondered why
brands bother to have a
‘For men’ line? There’s
actual science behind it!
Men will preferentially
choose products that
reaffirm their gender
identity over ones that
are neutral or feminine.
So, one solution to this
problem is targeting men
with their own brand of
green products and prac-
tices. Much like how we
have deodorant, razors,
and even tissues ‘For
Men’, a rebranding of the
green movement could
be very effective - to be
i n c l u -
“Undermining
a man’s
masculinity
could result
in direct
harm to the
environment”
sive of those who feel like
their masculinity needs
reaffirming.
Of course, this is only
really a band-aid solution
as it doesn’t solve the
real problem and is based
on the idea that we can
consume our way out
of the environmental
disaster we’re on a colli-
sion course with. I think
the best solution starts
with children - raise the
next generation to think
critically about the in-
formation they consume.
Your identity should be
more than a colour or
how ‘feminine’ you think
you might seem. Toxic
masculinity is simply
a collection of learned
negative behaviours, they
do not make or break a
man – the sooner we as a
society unlearn them, the
better.
Modern-day branding of masculinity is undermining our ability to man up to big problems
