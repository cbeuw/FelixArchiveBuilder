UoL to Split Up?

Fears over the future of the federal
University of London have arisen
this week. Following a meeting of
the Academic Board of Queen
Mary and Westfield College
( Q M W ) , the council of Q M W
resolved that it is to seek the power
to award its own degrees from the
Privy Council.
Professor Graham Zellick,
Principle of QMW, last week issued
a statement which said that the
Academic Board had voted 36-4 in
favour of seeking degree awarding
powers. Professor Zellick also said
that we would 'be writing formally
to the Vice-Chancellor in the near
future before taking matters further
with the Privy Council Office'.
This latest announcement by
QMW has been seen by some as the
most recent criticism of the archaic
nature in which the large colleges
are restricted by being part of the
federal University of London.
On Commemoration Day last
year, Sir Eric Ash, former Rector of
Imperial College, said, "our faith in
the ability of the University to deal
efficiently and equitably with
college business has been stretched,
sometimes to near breaking point
and occasionally beyond.". A press
officer at the London School of
Economics ( L S E ) said shortly

Imperial College Boat Club was
forced to cancel the National
Student Indoor Rowing Champion-
ships due to a low number of
entries. The competitions were to
have been held last Sunday,
Sponsorship for the event had
been secured from the manufacturers
of Concept II, the ergometer rowing
machine used by rowers for winter
training.
The event had been moved from
its usual date later in the year to
attract rowing teams coming to
London for a major rowing event
on the Saturday. Despite promoting
the event in the rowing magazine
Regatta, less than 40 entries from
other rowing teams around the
afterwards, "it is not a question of if
[LSE disaffiliates from the
University of London], but when".
However, in an attempt to calm
fears that QMW's ability to award
its own degrees will act as a catalyst
to the dissolving of the federal
University of London, Professor
Zellick states that the council had
'underlined its commitment to the
University of London'. He continues
by saying that the new power would
only be used under special
circumstances, such as the
conferment of honorary degrees.
In response to criticisms of the
structure of the University of
London, Professor Stuart
Sutherland, Vice-Chancellor of the
University, presented a paper in
March detailing the paths that it
could take. These included larger
colleges becoming universities in
their own right with no connection
to the federal University, except
historically. The question of
defederalisation is to be debated at
the next meeting of the Senate later
this month.
A press spokesman for the
University of London said, "our
position is that if [colleges] want to
pursue the opportunity to award
degrees then fair enough. There are
no conscripts, the main thing is that
there is continuing strong interest in
the value of the name of the
University of London degree.".
country were received. Even with
roughly 100 entries from rowers at
Imperial College, this fell short of
the 200 competitors expected.
B i l l Mason, Imperial College
Boat Club Coach, expressed regret
over the cancellation. He cited the
changed date as being a problem for
many teams, since it was too early
in the term for proper preparation. It
also clashed with an event in
Kingston. " A n extra few weeks
would have made the difference,"
he said, "but without enough teams
from other places it wouldn't have
been a meaningful event."
The sponsors have agreed to
cover the costs incurred by the Boat
Club in organising the champion-
ships. It is hoped that the event will
take place as normal next year.

Catering at Imperial College takes a
new twist on Tuesday with the
opening of 'Basics', Southside's
brand new pizzeria.
Located beside Southside Upper
Lounge, the cafe cost £90,000 to
develop and was designed as the
first purpose built food outlet on the
campus. It will take over from
Belushi's which was 'rushed in' in
1985. It represents the first major
catering project from the
Management Planning Group since
1986, when QT was set up in the
JCR.
The initial menu consists of a
bewildering variety of pizzas and
filled potatoes (which you can
watch being prepared). This will be
expanded to include such things as
salads and desserts. Soft and
alcoholic drinks are also on sale.
The serial killers amongst you will
be pleased to note that Chianti is
available, though fava beans are as
yet not an option.
Prices are much the same as
Belushi's (starting at about £2 for a
basic 9" pizza), and you don't have
to pay extra for any puns involving
the word 'basic' associated with
your meal. Incidentally, the name
'Basics' has allegedly been derived
from the word base (as in pizza
base) and IC.
The management team, led by
Neil Turtell, are hoping that it will
become 'the place to be' in College.
Future plans include a delivery
service, possibly run with student
labour.
Basics w i l l be open from
11.45am to 1.45pm and 5.30pm to
10pm daily from Tuesday, so if you
fancy 'a really exciting concept', or
some food, there's somewhere new
you can go.
Next week also sees the
renaming of the Southside disco.
'Cobwebs', as it is to be known,
will be held on Thursday and
Friday nights from 8.30pm to
11.15pm in the bar. Spooky
decorations will be arriving shortly.

Val Duncan and Sir Mark Turner was responsible for the original
development of the RTZ Group. The sponsorship amounts to £60,000 per
year for the next five years.
