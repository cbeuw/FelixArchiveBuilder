Kate Bush
The Red Shoes
Oh dear. I waited a long time for this. I
wondered why they picked 'Rubber Band Girl'
as a single. That and 'Eat The Music' are the
only remotely interesting things on the album.
Kate Bush has farmed acres of celestial light
sources but I'm loath to mention their names,
because they must surely be disappointed with
the dim result. It won't put you off your food but
for goodness sake, it's extraordinary: Prince
features in one of the tracks and it still emerges a
uniform stream of banal mush. Reading the
words in the cassette insert is more engaging
than the performances. There are a couple of
interesting images but they take sooooooo long
to arrive, and are delivered so unconvincingly
that after a few songs (I'm afraid you really can
generalise with this album) you find yourself
despairing of finding any satisfaction. Roll on
The Stones, Kate is gathering moss. (3)

Tad
Inhaler
This new album finds Tad moving towards a far
more rock oriented sound. Like most Sub Pop
bands their music has become progressively less
distorted over the years, and Dinosaur Jr's J.
Mascis at the production controls extracts
probably their best guitar sound to date. Pearl
Jam and the Screaming Trees are the closest
reference points and like these two, the vocalist
sets the whole band ahead of the pack. Tad
Doyle's vocal range has expanded from the
snarl of 'God's Balls' and '8-Way Santa' but
don't expect any ballads yet. Sub Pop fans could
be disappointed but rock fans may be
(un)pleasantly surprised. (6)

7 Inch Sulk
The A side of this limited edition release, 'Stop
I Start' is, according to the press release, a live
favourite. I can see why. It's a dirty,
claustrophobic piece of not quite grunge which
revels in the line "**** me gently with a
chainsaw", a good opportunity for crowd
involvement if I've ever heard one. "I swear I
can't do anything /1 swear I can't?" barks the
singer and he's right. The young lady with the
voice like a wisp of cloud who pops up
unexpectedly in the chorus can though. The
downside to this song is - gasp! - the guitars
sound like Sonic Youth, but we've lived with
that before. Buy it, kids.

Family Cat
Springing the Atom
The record label reckons this "marks yet another
sonic step forward for the band" and, for once,
you can believe the hype.
'Springing...' boasts a great hook amidst
atmospheric strings and worthy guitar breaks,
proving The Cat to be way above yer standard
indie-guitar fare. But don't buy this for the
A-side alone. 'Prop 4' is even better, with all
manner of strangled guitar noises wrapped
around a punk-inspired melody. Give this single
a spin!

Soul Asylum
Astoria
It's that difficult first shot at the big time show
and things ain't running to plan. Out go the
hardcore following and in sweep the M T V
masses. The Venus Beads open the show with
their poppy Teenage Fanclub sound but the
crowd aren't into it. They're here to see stars.
After a lengthy wait Soul Asylum take the
stage. Ten years or so on the road has made
them an awesome live band, but they are
reluctant stars. Anything off 'Grave Dancers
Union' is met with crowd surfing or raised
lighters (?) depending on tempo, while their
riotous covers and older stuff are met with
puzzled indifference. This visibly strains Dave
Pirner their singer, and despite a magnificent set
the gig ends somewhat abruptly and
acrimoniously. A year ago, Soul Asylum blew
the roof off the Marquee and tonight I think they
would much rather have been there.
Evan Dando arrived late, blowing out his
promised support slot, but appeared briefly in a
cameo role as a drunken bum, which he carried
off with ease.

Silverscreen
Imperial College
Silverscreen are playing carnivalesque music to
two hundred drunken revellers, but the crisp
distinctive edge that grabbed me at the
soundcheck has been lost somewhere between
the free-flowing cider and the awful tinny setup.
The lead singer nods his head to Brett
Anderson's cockney swooning but barely taps
his foot on stage. And he's dressed in denim,
good grief, you simply cannot stand still and
look languid in black levis. Meanwhile, the
others spiral about in their own little orbits. (I
know, I know, cut to the chase!)
The point? This band are ex-Jazz and Rock
ascendants. You know, the guys no-one goes to
watch on a Thursday night. And they're good!
People are dancing! 'Splinter', the set closer and
the best of a sometimes uneven repertoire, feels
complete and ready to wed vinyl. Earlier on,
with two less guitars and a keyboard they
defined a sound they could certainly claim to be
nearly their own. What's needed are several
more great strides away from Southside Lounge.
A little cohesion and a little confidence (yes,
you can sing, yes, you can turn down that
persuasive bass a little).
And then you'll all be clamouring to claim
you saw the premier screening.
