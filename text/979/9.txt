Over the years Felix has
offered a popular platform
for scientists who wish to
communicate their findings
to a broad community of
people who take an active
interest in science and
technology.
Yet the British public at
large tend to regard
scientists as poor
communicators. The Daily
Telegraph Young Science
Writer Awards 1994 offers an
opportunity to bridge the
divide: write an article which
informs and entertains the
public, and the winners will
have their articles published
on the Wednesday science
page of Britain's most
popular quality daily
newspaper.
Other prizes include ^
substantial cash awards plus
an all expenses paid week-long trip to New
Orleans for the 1995 Meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
In addition, first prize winners will receive
£500 and an invitation to meet Britain's most
distinguished scientists at the British
