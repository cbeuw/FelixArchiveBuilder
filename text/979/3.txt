Royal Society report snubs honours classification New Shops
Ex-Rector Calls for Changes
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Student funding must undergo a far-
reaching review if targets for higher
education are to be met, according
to a report by a Royal Society study
group released on Tuesday.
The group, chaired by the former
Rector of Imperial College, Sir Eric
Ash, said that provisions for student
maintenance costs should be
brought more into line with those in
other E C countries. This would
involve tightening up means testing
for grants and moving towards the
imposition of graduate taxes or new
forms of loan. Tuition fees for both
full and part-time students would be
paid by the Government. The
changes are intended to make it
easier for students from lower
'socio-economic classes' to continue
their education after leaving school.
Universities are currently not
attracting enough students from
these groups to meet the target of
one third of young people in higher
education by the year 2000.
The group also calls for
significant changes to degree
courses, including the ending of the
'honours classification'. In its place,
students would receive a transcript
of individual results for each course
module taken. An indication of an
overall standard could then be
calculated in the form of some
weighted average. This system
would allow courses to be more
flexible in adapting to the needs of
individual students. The effect that
this would have upon the 'value' of
degrees from universities with
distinguished reputations is not
mentioned.
The report suggests that all
science degrees should be modelled
after engineering courses by
offering two courses in each subject.
There would be an enhanced four
year course for students aspiring to
a career in science, accompanied by
a reduced syllabus three year course
for 'general' students.
The chairman of the Royal
Society's education committee,
Professor Roger Blin-Stoyle, said
that this would help fulfil the need
for civil servants and politicians to
have a better understanding of
science.
Recommendations made about
the academic teaching of science
include a greater emphasis on
teaching performance when
considering recruitment and
promotion. Research students
should play a greater part in
teaching as assistants, according to
the report.
Commenting on IC Radio,
Professor Blin-Stoyle said that
science courses which are 'more
useful in the real world' must be
made available.

A new look for the Sherfield
walkway should be ready after
Christmas, according to I C U
President, Andrew Wensley.
Plans to improve services on the
walkway by opening a new shop
unit have now been approved. The
Management Planning Group, the
top advisory body of Imperial
College, agreed to the proposals in
a meeting earlier this week. The
projected income over the next
three years is £60,000. However,
the Union is expected to spend
£25,000 in the first year, paying for
refurbishing costs and rent. The
rent for the other two years of the
three year lease will amount to
£10,000.
The walkway unit will be leased
from the College by the Union. The
immediate plan is to sublet the
larger, newly-built premises to a
relocated STA Travel office. This
would leave the current office
vacant. Union officials are currently
deciding who will fill this space.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Wensley
said, "This will brighten up a rather
drab part of the walkway."
