FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER SPORT 16
F E L I X SPORT
Football seconds fall foul to the
wilds of Zone Six
The suburban outback is not to be
travelled to lightly, as the Second
team footballers discovered to their
cost on Saturday. Despite a 3-2 home
win against the same team three days
earlier, the loss of both strikers, Alex
and Martin, and defensive stalwart
Will did not bode well for our heroes.
Strong winds, first from Pill Sir in
the changing rooms, and then sweep-
ing across the heavy pitch dismayed
IC during the seemingly endless wait
for the ref to start the match. From
the kick-off IC were under pressure
and it wasn't long before we were 2-
0 down. However "the Slags" imme-
diately rallied, showing the grit and
steel that makes a man - an attitude
that says "You wanna fight? Fight
me!" With this attitude, our fortunes
can only continue to rise.
A free kick from the half-way line
gave debutant lone-striker Robo the
chance to lay it off, a mis-hit shot rat-
tled Gold's defence and was neatly
finished off by young Dave. At half-
time Captain Courageous Steve
changed to a flat back four, as the
right wing-backs had so far failed to
exploit the space available to them.
Unfortunately a culmination of
appaling refereeing, bad light and
inspirational finishing from
Goldsmiths meant that with five
minutes to go, IC were 5-1 down.
With light fading rapidly, and the
game descending rapidly into a
brawl, the referee awarded a free-
kick to IC - and presumably acting
on a new FIFA directive, proceeded
to strangle the dissenting Golds
right-back! The home team struggled
to separate the two, and the match
was abandoned five minutes early.
An ignominious end to the Seconds
unbeaten run.
Rugby Thirds
finally show
their mettle
With a new 15 man composition,
last minute preparations were made
to set plays. The team pulled togeth-
er from the kick-off, instantly con-
verting effort into points. The fat
ugly lads showed the girlies what
scoring tries is all about.
The Viking opened the scoring,
with his second of the season. The
return of Dan Seaman was chris-
tened with a try. Bashari, Yommi,
Charlie Joint and captain Tom
Howard also added trys to a magnif-
icent final total. To add to the humil-
iation, a tactical substitution only
minutes from the end of the match
resulted in another two tries, to leave
the final score 44-0. Christophe
Sudgen once again demonstrated his
lack of speed, made up by shear size
and skill.
Damn good game.
RSM Footballers
victorious on all
fronts
FIRSTS
A good game, with RSM proving
that their first game of the season
was no freak. A brilliant goal by
Kersten set up the scoring; goals
from Si, Johan and two by Michael
follwed.
Ten minutes into the second-half,
RSM were down to ten men, as
Kersten went off injured, allowing
the defence to earn their keep, as IC
held out for the rest of the match.
Final score 5-0
S E C O N D S
UCL proved a difficult team to play
in the first-half. However the sec-
ond-half saw RSM playing the oppo-
sition out of the game. In the end,
UCL were lucky to get away with
only four against them.
Final score 4-0
IC Waterpolo storm into London
number one spot
The first round of the BUSA water-
polo competition was played last
weekend and resulted in a resound-
ing victory for the hosts, IC.
Originally planned as a tournament
with five teams, three made last
minute cancellations leaving only IC
and St Mary's to play off for the
positions of first and second London
College seeds.
Despite having only the minimum
number of players allowed, St
Mary's put up spirited resistance to
an IC team consisting of several
national league and international
players.
Goal followed goal as the medics
were unable to meet the superior
speed and skills of the home team.
The result was a crushing 15-2 score-
line which did not really reflect the
even greater difference in the abili-
ties of the two teams.
The result is that both St Mary's
and IC go through to the next round
of the BUSA competition, which
will be a tournament against various
other universities. This is due to take
place on the 23rd of November, and
any spectators would be warmly
received and appreciated.
IC rule the waves
IC Boat Club got off to a successful
start to the season in the Fullers
Fours Head on Saturday. Yet again
we have been confirmed as one of
the major boating powers in the
country, winning three divisions -
more than any other club.
The race is rowed as a time-trial
for five-hundred crews over the
Mortlake to Putney boat race course.
IC's top quadruple scull came fifth
overall. They won the Senior Two
division, beating a boat with former
Olympic Champions the Searle
brothers on board in the process.
Reigning world under-23 champi-
ons Richard Dunn, Simon Dennis,
Louis and Stefan Eyre were one of
the fastest coxless fours on the day
and won the Senior 1 division. An
excellent performance was put in by
a coxless four consisting of Jeremy
Hicks, Alex Large, Jon Watchorn
and Julian Davenport, who won the
Senior 2 division.
All the winners are now looking
forward to a free party in Fullers
brewery.
