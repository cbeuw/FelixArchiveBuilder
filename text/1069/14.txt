14 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER
Sport in brief
B A S K E T B A L L
A week of defeats was to follow the
brilliant start of the season for the
Basketball club teams. The ladies
team fought well for 35 minutes
against the undoubtedly superior
team of Queen Mary, but played the
price for a reluctant start to the game.
At half-time Queen Mary headed off
26-16, and an effort of the IC girls at
the beginning of the escond half
seemed to balance the game. Soon,
however, Queen Mary restored their
lead to 10 points, and in the last five
minutes IC gave up, to eventually go
down by 59-34.
On Friday, the IC Men's second
team played their first match against
St Georges hospital. A defeat of 72-
42 came as a natural consequence of
the lack of practice, but there is still
plenty of time to make up, ready for
the next game.

IC netball ladies continued their
good start to the season with their
third win from four matches. In a
very close game, IC fought hard
through three quaters, keeping up
with Royal Holloway to start the
fourth and final quarter trailing 6-9.
In a majestic spurt from all the mem-
bers of the team, IC snatched victory
from their old rivals.
SNOOKER
Following on from last week's dissa-
pointment at Warwick, both IC
snooker teams bounced back with
solid wins over Southampton in our
first home matches of the season.
In the 'A' team, both Simon
Baugh and Jon Fulcher were unbeat-
en throughout, and Vay Ly raised a
cheer with a stunning 74 clearance
on the way to a 14 frames to 6 victo-
ry-
The 'B' team also did the biz, and
avenged some past memories by
winning 14-11.
C R O S S - C O U N T R Y
Richmond Park was the venue for
this tragic event. Everything was set
up with Jennie coming first in the
women's race, but a disappointing
second place for the tactically inept
"Elvis" McCallum left the Gary
Moare crew distraught after the race.
The King's finish marred the perfor-
mances of the rest of the IC team,
probably due to the fact that he ate
too many burgers before the race.
Fischick improved to seventh,
Ponytail was consistent with twelfth,
and Gaffer came thirteenth. Emily
was on top form, and the general per-
formance ensures both the women
and the men came first.
IC Fencers demolish all-comers

The IC men's squad put on their best
performance of the season to demol-
ish the Royal Holloway team, just
missing out on a whitewash. Again
our foil team started off and coasted
past Holloway 9-0, with Dave
Hughes stepping in in place of col-
lege no. 1 Henry Morton, and con-
ceding just one hit in his three match-
es. The sabre team continued their
winning streak, also winning 9-0,
and finally the epee team started out
8-0 up until the final match, where
partly due to an equipment problem
we lost 5-3. This gave an overall
score of 26-1.
Happily, Holloway's fencing abil-
ity proved to be inversely proportion-
al to their drinking ability, as they
joined us for ourfirstsocial event of
the year.
The members of our victorious
drinking squad were: Eddie, Dave
Hughes and Dave Davidge on foil;
Nigel, Phil, Reuben and Gavin on
epee; and Mo, Nick and Thorsten
with the sabre.
W O M E N
After a slow start to the season, with
defeats to strong teams from QMW
and UCL, the IC women's team
finally got their act together, crshing
Royal Holloway 16-2.
A couple of injuries left a team of
three fencing both weapons. Even so,
this was enough for IC to battle
through, winning both the foil and
the epee 8-1. Especially impressive
on the day was Elaine Smith, win-
ning two epee fights, despite never
having used the weapon before the
match!.
The other team members were
Monica Pingo-Almada and Davina
Wong.
Hockey Thirds march on, aided
by Digger and Argos
"Argos" proved to be a bargain buy
in the pre-season rush for quality
players when he hammered in a
reverse stick tool kit at 60% of his
recommended retail price after just
12 seconds.
After the six minutes of time-out
whilst the Thirds celebrated this mir-
acle from Heaven (in which "Indian
Carpet Catalogue" completed a
reverse double summersault over the
enemy scum's goal). Jesus rolled
back the stone and made wine from
water by making a goal from nothing
when he dribbled the ball from our
25 line, with the St Georges defence
parting like the Red Sea.
The "Virgin" provided the excite-
ment and tension that was needed in
the 24th minute when following a
pass from "Vidal Sassoon" he
reverse flicked a blinder from the left
of the D, confusing all the opposition
with his deft handy-work.
After half-time, "Indian Carpet
Catalogue" flew down the right-
wing, as if on a magic carpet - he did-
n't hang about, putting a goal in the
right corner.
Soon after, Skank stole through
the George's scum, despite their bad
aromas, taking the power from his
enchanted woolly hat, and slipped
the ball up past the legs of their keep-
er.
By this time St Georges were fum-
ing at their own inadequacies, and
were resorting to abusing the
umpires, thus it was only a matter of
time before we were awarded a
penalty strike.
Now, last time our keeper, Digger,
stepped up to the spot he disaster-
oualy missed, but being the kind soul
he is, our captain, Virgin, decided to
give him another chance. Digger dug
deep, and saw the light at the end of
the tunnel. That light was a penalty
flick so fast the ball ripped through
the net, flew skywards and has not
been seen since.
The final score, 6-0, was nothing
less than a triumph. March on.
