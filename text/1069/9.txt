FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER NEWS FEATURE 9
WE
ARE
NOT
ALONE
The Truth IS out
there! Whilst wander-
ing around a dusty ware-
house with his cynical-
but-attractive partner,
Simon 'Spooky' Wistow
discovers that...
Finally someone else has seen the
light!
Following a series of debates in its
last few Union Councils the
University of West of
England (UWE) is
deciding whether or
not to disaffiliate
itself from the NUS
thus associating
itself with the likes
of Glasgow,
Edinburgh and of
course ICU, the
largest non-NUS
affiliated union in the
country. There are cur-
rently only five unassociat-
cd unis as opposed to 860 that
are.
The NUS was set up in 1922
because a large number of students
were being drafted for the First
World War. The ideal was that it was
to be seen as a peace movement,
operating on a national basis, for stu-
dents who believed in a better future.
In other words, according to the NUS
press office, "a forum for nice ideas
... it is still a fairly intimate organisa-
tion *
• any idea that a student has may
end up as a whole campaign."
Imperial dropped out in 1977 when it
became dissatisfied with the
arrangement it had, which was a
case of give but no take. It was felt
that the affiliation fee, now
£40,000 per annum, could be bet-
ter used by channelling it directly
into ICU. The NUS's mission is to
represent students, locally, national-
ly and internationally, to promote the
views of students on the education
system, promote the interests of stu-
dents on economic, social and youth
issues which
have a
direct
effect on the
status and welfare of students, pro-
mote and assist the improvement of
Student Unions and inform and train
Student union officers. However
many students don't really believe
that they are being represented, the
only real contact that they have with
the organisation is during Freshers'
week and through their NUS cards
which offer 10% discount in many
institutions. What many students
don't realise is that the majority of
these establishments will accept any
Union card. Also, any beneficial
effects from NUS campaigning will
still apply to us; how likely is it that
the Government will say "fair
enough, we'll boost grant levels back
up again but not for Imperial students
because they aren't in the NUS"?
The NUS is supposed to encourage
its unions to hold disassociation
debates on a regular basis although
this isn't exactly rigorously enforced
.It does seem a touch inept, though, at
persuading those who have strayed to
come back to fold. Imperial has dis-
cussed rejoining but the NUS presi-
dent, Jim Murphy, made a bad show
at a 1995 conference meeting - he did
not turn up. You may also have read
in 'London Student' about the fact
that IC "is at war" with the London
Branch of the NUS. When one of
our reporters, Kent Yip (see oppo-
site page), phoned up Mandela
house, to discuss NUS services in
London, he was passed round
numerous telephone extensions until
eventually being told that they could
not help him because Imperial is not
Sarah White, president of ICU in
1995 and now the ULU president, is
concerned by the behaviour of the
NUS. "If the NUS want unaffiliated
colleges to reaffiliate they need to see
exactly what the NUS does, other-
wise they won't know what they are
missing. The Press Office refusing to
speak to someone merely because
they are from an unaffiliated college
is unprofessional and stupid".
We shall have to wait until the end
of the term until the results of UWE's
referendum. Will they decide that the
NUS is actually worth forty grand a
year or that we're right and that
you're better off on your own?
Either way though this could be the
tip of the iceberg as more and more
universities go to the ballots over
their position with the National
Union. Only time will tell if our way
of life will become the norm in uni-
versities across the country.
opportunity to promote their cause. IC is not
alone in being discriminated. Universities of
Edinburgh and Glasgow have also stayed out
of it, and it is known that UWE at Bristol will
be balloting soon to decide the future of their
membership in the NUS.
Politicians arc now axing the welfare of col-
lege students, who play no part in deciding the
balance of power at Westminster when elections
come. In the face of such patronising attitude, we
should speak up louder and clearer. Praise is
where praise is due. The effort of the NUS in
campaigning on our behalf is certainly laudable.
Whilst their loudspeaker is doing a good job in
amplifying our voices, is it getting therightmes-
sage across?
