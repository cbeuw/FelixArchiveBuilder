12 C O L U M N S FELIX FRIDAY 1 5TH NOVEMBER
Cynicism is one of those twentieth
century social diseases that has per-
vaded almost every walk of life, so it
was refreshing to see the letter from
Linda Hart in Felix that followed up
on her earlier gripes about sandwich-
es. She reported that John Foster, the
Head of Catering, had reassured her
that everything was all right and the
sandwiches aren't really a rip-off.
Well, that's OK then isn't it. Oh
deary, deary me. Dr Hart, you've
been sold a dummy. Given the clas-
sic 'don't you worry, it's all right.
Uncle John knows best' line. Of
course, you must realise this, but are
too polite to 'analyse' his response.
That's where I'll pick up the story.
John Foster, who, it must be said
was most generous in offering a per-
sonal response to the letter, is, I fear,
living on a different planet.
However, Linda, you are wrong to
suggest that QT sandwiches are on
average 15% more expensive than
surrounding outlets. They are, to use
your figure, 32.5% more expensive.
Three little letters -
V.A.T. We don't charge
it, they do. Therefore,
College Catering should
automatically have an
inbuilt 17.5% price
advantage. The notion
that the Sandwich Shop
on Gloucester Rd has
lower overheads is
laughable. How do you
think that making the
sandwiches on site can
be cheaper than con
Simon Baker
loss of over Â£100,000, a pathetic per-
formance flattered by strong results
from Southside Bar (naturally) and
Southside Shop (on
grounds of failure). I
am sure that you are a
more effective manager
than your reply sug-
gests, but your depart-
ment is failing badly.
As I have said count-
less times before, you
should be able to
undercut a small shop
in a high rent area of
London. Should you
wish to discuss this
tracting out the work to a Voice Of Reason with me, as you did
larger firm? If you are with Linda, then may I
right, then the whole direction of post suggest a lunchtime chat at the single
war economic theory appears to be
misguided. 'Any trading surplus is
reinvested'. Correct me if I'm wrong,
but the last figures that I saw for the
net profitability of Catering showed a
jewel in your crown, Southside Bar.
Best beer in London, nay Britain, at
some of the lowest prices. If they can
manage it with pints, why can't the
same be done with sandwiches?
I recently heard about something
called 'The Spice Girls.' Sellers of
condiments, I thought, but apparent-
ly, these charming young ladies have
formed a beat combo that recently
reached the top of the hit parade. It
was thus with some relish that I read
Vik's excellent review of the said
artistes album last week. But hark!
What lyrics did I see but 'God help
the mister that comes between me
and my sister.' Having my finger on
the musical pulse, I immediately
recognised these lyrics as originating
from The Beverly Sisters hit;
'Sisters', which (much) older readers
may care to verify. We at Felix aim
to be distinctive. Where else do you
get a Thatcherite, techno loving, real
ale connoisseur with a working
knowledge of the Beverly Sisters
creations. I tell you, lady, there'll
never be another one.
i n t h e c o u r s e of d u t y
Well, well, well. It seems that the
so-called 'Russell Group' is in the
news again. For those of you who
don't know, this is a collection of
powerful individuals from some of
the greater academic institutions of
this country; Cambridge, Oxford and
Imperial among them. Their touted
aim is to create a 'superleague' of the
best universities and colleges in the
country, to claim the best students
and the greatest funding for their
research. For some reason many
people are completely up in arms
about this idea; but to me it seems a
very sensible, even vital move. The
fact is that this country needs a
superleague, and needs it badly.
In recent years the concept of uni-
versity education has changed. It is
no longer 'education' as such, but
merely a complicated way of allow-
ing people to find better jobs, with-
out having to prove themselves in
any real way. As employers demand
degree level staff, youngsters have to
have a degree regardless of its rele-
vance or importance; and so univer-
sities nowadays cater almost solely
to this need. With the increase of
student numbers and the conversion
of worthy polytechnics into second
rate universities, the situation has
gone from bad to plainly farcical.
Everybody needs a degree, so every-
body must have one. Thus, universi-
ties must cater to the lowest common
denominator in order to survive.
Thus, those who really do want to
learn, who really do want an educa-
tion, are left stranded and without a
hope.
This is why the superleague is
necessary. It will not attempt to
reverse the trend, but will go with it.
Those universities who are there to
provide qualifications can carry on
with their task, and hopefully allow
their courses to cater more directly to
workplace training (since most
degree educated people don't know
an in-tray from an out-tray, a desk
from a filing cabinet). Meanwhile
the superleague can concentrate on
the serious task of learning; provid-
ing facilities for those who are not
suited to the job market, who wish to
go into research, or who merely want
to gain a higher understanding of the
workings of the world, and our place
in it.
So we should all support the idea
of a superleague. If it is created the
balance will be redressed, and with a
bit of effort university education will
finally become once more (or maybe
in fact for the first time) what it
always should have been; education.

supplied by poetic
In my wake...
In my wake, I think of you,
A burn at my heart
Everyday getting stronger.
And as the wind lifts my soul,
I wonder how we do
To stay apart,
To stay alone
With fear, I observe what we have done.
A silence without end where we are both at fault;
The will to extend what cannot be.
A passion destroyed by a dream.
Our love destroyed by the ocean:
We shall stare for days into emptiness,
Without sound to reassure,
As the last days will leave.
