FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER SPORT 15
IC Hockey rises victoriously to the occasion, thanks to....
determined men...
Well, another win in the BUSA
league makes sure that IC seconds
end up in the top three of their
league, and proceed ever-onwards,
to the next round of the competition.
A well earned victory against an
organised (if not skillful) side was
earned as ever in their selfless play
and overiding energy and enthusi-
asm - the key features which have
characterised play in the Seconds
this year.
Yet again, IC scored early in the
game when Rich Brunt, thinking
more of his team than himself, laid
the ball off for Goran to teleport the
ball into the back of the net. As nor-
mal IC, became complacent and let
UMDS back into the game, with a
well finished goal. The game flowed
between the two halves with IC
gradually becoming mother superior,
leading to yet another goal for our
cartoon reject Shaggy. At this rate of
scoring, we must be in danger of
loosing him to a second-rate outfit
like the Firsts.
The second-half started with
UDMS pressing for an equaliser but
IC held out, with S. McTavish
psyching out their striker in the
penalty flick (which had been need-
lessly given away by Monkey
Magic). IC finally got their act
together as the match rolled towards
it's conclusion, and pushed upwards
and inwards, as UMDS began to col-
lapse under the IC vice of superiori-
ty. They finally crumbled, giving
Arnst his first goal for IC.
By now UMDS were frantic, lead-
ing to two clumsy tackles from IC
resulting in a green and yellow card,
which nearly gave away the match.
But we still secured the victory,
showing the determination which
has carried us to victory this season.
The final scoreline was a convincing
3-1 to IC.

3-0 to the IC!! 3-0 to the IC!!
The IC First babes kicked butt!
(Finally).
With a new star centre forward
and the "humming cow" as our
amazing centre-defence, we started
the game. IC dominated most of the
first-half scoring two unbelievable
goals, thefirstfrom Annaly and the
second by Sarah. Excellent!
Our new centre-forward also man-
aged a swift second goal. No more a
sweeping Sarah - more like a scoring
Sarah! Good luck later kiddo.
Many thanks go to the Mens First
XI, who provided wonderful support
during the entire match.(The mens
captain writes "We sang our voices
sore, mooned our bums blue, and fell
in love with UCE bum no. six").
Thanks too to Angela and Elaine for
playing - you were great.
At last, IC ladies seem to be on a
roll.

IC Football show their class
BY D ROSENTHAL
FELIX SOCCER CORRESPONDENT
Finally we got it together, showing
our true class drawing 2-2 with a
King's College team containing
seven ULU players. In the end, only
a blatantly biased (and shit) referee
could save King's reputation and
their rear end.
The one moment of brilliance
from IC was due to one man. At the
end of his amazing run, taking him
from D to D, past many a tackle, the
Chicken was put in the Boil by
Kabadi. 1-OtoIC.
A well worked short corner varia-
tion was clinically finished by
Kabadi; 2-0.
This seemed an unassailable lead,
but King's fought back. Sustained
opposition pressure led to Nimal
messing up the marking. Result,
Chickenbol concedes a flick: Red
Helmet was close to it, but not close
enough 2-1. Then the distaste that
was 2-2. Unlucky lads.
All that remains to be said is that
2.4 inches was useless as usual, and
that the jokes of Rent Boy just could-
n't guide us to victory, but he is a
funny bloke - and we all love him.
