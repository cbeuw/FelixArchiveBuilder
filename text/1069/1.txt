With Higher Education establishe-
ments throughout England set to be
hit by industrial action next week, a
settlement to the dispute still seems
distant. Tuesday's strike has been
organised by a consortium of eight
unions with members working in
Higher Education.
The strike has been called as a
result of proposed national pay
increases of 1.5% for university staff,
which union's insist constitutes a pay
cut in real terms. This is being hailed
as the first time in the history of
Higher Education that every rank of
staff from "Porter to Professor" are
going to close university gates.
Support for the strike has not been
unaminious, however, with three of
the union's that voted 'yes' only
achieving a majority choosing indus-
trial action of 2% or less. The turnout
was low, with an overall participa-
tion ofjust 59%. Bryan Wilson, pres-
ident of the IC branch of the
Association of University Teachers
claimed that, in contrast to the nor-
mal turnout at a general election,
which is generally less that 50%, this
was a "reflection of the anger" felt by
staff at "paltry payrises".Mr Wilson
also commented that this decision
came from a group of people who are
normally reluctant to take any form
of action at all.
The form the protest is taking
incited criticism from both the col-
lege hierarchy and Imperial College
Union. Eric Allsop, the ICU presi-
dent, said that he felt the strike was
"almost certainly justified", but was
concerned at the possible effect on
students, particularly that any higher
offers would lead to a "financial
backlash" against the students and
loss of staff. He said that he would
not encourage students to cross pick-
et lines.
The Pro-Rector for Educational
Quality, Professor Alan Swanson,
went further, dubbing the situation
"very messy". Himself a member of
the AUT, he said that he would not
be joining the picket line, as he felt
the students were losing more than
could be gained. He also said that he
would be "surprised if the
Government turned in their tracks"
and reversed the decline in funding
for Higher Education simply as a
result of the forthcoming strike.
Professor Swanson said that he
could not guess at the likely support
for the strike, but believed that
among the technical staff it would be
"pretty solid". This would mean the
shutdown of all labs, though he
pledged that students would not be
"unjustly penalised" for missing lab
sessions if there was a strike. He
warned, however, that it is not up to
students whether to turn up or not,
and left it to Heads of Department to
advise students about what to do on
Tuesday.
The Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh
has written to all staff advising them
of the College's position, and
reminding them that the strike would
mean the loss of a day's pay. The
AUT have asked the College to
donate any deducted staff pay to the
Student Hardship Fund.
Bryan Wilson appealed to the stu-
dent population, asking that the strik-
ers have "if not their support, at least
their understanding."

Tory MP: 1.5% pay deal
is "Derisory"
A N D R E W SMITH
Jerry Hayes, one of John Major's
most ardent supporters, has admitted
that the 1.5% pay deal offered to
University lecturers and administra-
tors is "derisory". In an open and
frank meeting arranged by Imperial
College Conservative Society he
refused to condemn the action
planned for next Tuesday, saying of
the striking personnel, "It is their
democratic right."
Even when urged by the former
IC ConSoc Chair to condemn the
one day strike, Mr Hayes refused,
saying that he was not in the business
of condemning strikes. While admit-
ting that he had forgotten to "mug up
on" the higher education dispute
before addressing the Imperial
College gathering, the 43 year old
MP said that he could "understand"
how lecturers feel.
The Member of Parliament for
Harlow did suggest however that,
"The worst way of dealing with the
Tory Government is to go on strike."
With pressure by right wing student
members to oppose the national stop-
page Mr Hayes did admit that "Of
course, it [the strike action] is not
going to work", later saying that "we
