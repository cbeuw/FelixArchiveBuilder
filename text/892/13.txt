Dear Andy,
Hmm, interesting...Sorry, just imagining
the next Felix compared to this one I'm
looking at n o w (891). I mean, the
editorial; it seems to be saying that y o u
'aint too pleased with these Christian
types shooting off at the mouth with
opinions and things what they believe in
and y o u don't. Funny old thing, but looks
to me like most of the letters page is
people letting fire with their o w n
opinions, saying who's right and who's
wrong. I mean, take that A t h e n a thing
(can't say bloke or some such on account
of it being too scared to give its name):
must be into thousands of words of
opinion by n o w . If I was editor I'd be
getting a bit tired of it. But y o u don't pick
on it, y o u pick on a couple of Christians
instead.
Seriously though, I don't see any
consistency in your complaints. After all,
a good portion of Felix is opinion
(thankfully: pure facts are so boring!) so
you can't really pick on one, even if y o u
don't like it and/or the w a y it's
presented. Yet y o u rip into Carrie
explaining her views on abortion with
great v i m and vigour (at least she gave
you an argument, rather than an opinion
like—for instance—all veggies are a
'miserable ill shower' (quoting A l a n
Bailey). She also made it clear it was her
own personal belief. Nor were y o u over-
tolerant of David's letter ('if y o u can't
answer his/her questions', y o u said, in
your rant) w h e n one with similar failings
by M r Pendragon in the previous issue
went without comment.
In short y o u have two options: accept
that anyone c a n say what they like in
opinion areas of Felix, or b a n anyone
from having opinions at all. The former
would mean you'd have to stop picking
on Christians (and others), the latter
would probably get y o u o n good terms
with His Rectorness...
Finally, I k n o w Christians have a long
history of persecution (it's actually good
for you: 'Blessed are y o u w h e n y o u suffer
insults and persecution for m y sake'
(Matthew 5:11) but I'd rather get m y
blessings in a w a y that meant y o u
weren't storing up trouble for yourself). If
you want to continue it that's your
business.
Yours awkwardly,
Andy Cooksley, Physics 3.
P.S. For the record, yes I a m (another)
Christian.
P.P.S. No, I haven't shoved the gospel
down your neck, nor do I intend to drag
the entire Felix staff into the nearest
church. If y o u want to know about
Christianity, there are anough Christian
groups in college for y o u to go and talk
to. A t least then there's a chance for a
real time argument (on those lines, if
anyone wants to come back to me on
this, drop me a line v i a the Physics
pigeonholes).
Art and Money
Dear Andy,
In the (hopefully) last blast of the arts
subsidy debate, I will attempt to answer
the points I either (a) forgot, or (b) didn't
make clear enough in m y last reply.
1. Don't be silly, Alan. Of course arts
aren't the only subsidised leisure activity.
Look at sports centres and training
courses subsidised by local government.
They exist. I know because I've been
in/on them.
2. Aren't w e a clever bunny, A l a n (pass
the shampoo..)? Taking a quote out of
context is just about the oldest trick in
the book. What I was implying by that
statement was that people just don't think
about the theatre as a possibility. Apathy
rather than antipathy.
3. A l a n asks w h y we don't solely
produce musicals etc. This is just like
asking w h y T V doesn't show game shows
all the time. They may be popular, but
they are intellectual popcorn, fun, but
with no nutritional value. This is really
our fundemental differance. A l a n believes
that money is all important. I like to
think that there is more to the way we
live our than that.
4. Good and sucessful are not
synonmys. It is an unfortunate fact of life
that sometimes the trash suceeds. Look at
the sucess of Kylie Minogue...
5. I, and everyone else, called A l a n a
bigot for one good reason. It's the best
word.
As for the rest of Mr.Bailey's comments,
all I can say is that he is steadily
destroying what small credibility he once
had.
Yours finally,
Pendragon (aka Adam Tinworth)
