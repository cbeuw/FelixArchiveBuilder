Calling Impoverished Students
The registry has only received 220
applications for the £259,400 available to
students i n economic hardship. T h e
money, given to the College b y the
Government, forms what has become
k n o w n as the Access fund.
Mr Cullen, from the Registry, contacted
Senior Tutors over two weeks ago,
expressing his concern at the subdued
flow of applications. Although the tutors
were asked to further publicise the
existance of the fund in their
departments, no flood materialised.
The good news for those w h o have
applied this year is that M r Cullen plans
to distribute all of this year's fund. This is
also good news for future years as it
prevents the Government cutting next
year's lump sum.
Mr Cullen has said that the Access fund
is his number one priority. H e will read
over all applications next week and will
start making his golden handshake
decisions soon. T h e applications are not,
as rumour had it, gojng to be discussed
by a committee. They are seen only b y
M r Cullen w h o m a y consult with college
tutors, Julia Higgins and David
Goodgame.
For those w h o are not totally apathetic,
application forms are still available from
room 344 Sherfield. T h e nominal closing
date is T O D A Y .
IC Anti - War Society March Through London
Despite the cold weather, a group of
around twenty Imperial College students
marched through central London last
Saturday as part of the largest British
anti-war demonstration since the
beginning of hostilities.
The procession of over 30,000 took
nearly three hours to reach Hyde Park
from the Embankment where they heard
speeches calling for an immediate
ceasefire from T o n y Benn, Barnie Grant
and others involved in the anti-war
movement.
During the course of the m a r c h there
were many shouts of 'well done Imperial',
from onlookers and a steady stream of
ex-IC students enquiring about the
activities of the peace movement at the
College. These included Piers Corbyn, a
past Union President (69-70), w h o had
been involved in anti-Vietnam W a r
campaigns at I.C. and is n o w a part-time
weatherman and lecturer at South Bank
Polytechnic.
Groups from a wide political spectrum
were present including those from the
Green, Liberal and Labour Parties. There
was also the brief appearance of a
'Victory to Iraq' banner at the back of the
rally.
On the same day twelve people visited
the Cenotaph in support of the war.
