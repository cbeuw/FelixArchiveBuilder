W
hy do our bodies
wear down as we
get older? What
turns us from
jumping, frol-
icking children into aching, creaking
OAPs? And could we ever stop this
process?
Twilight fans will be thrilled to hear
that the secret to immortality might
really lie in people’s blood.
Neural stem cells, the self-renew-
ing, pluripotent cells that develop into
the different type of cells that make up
the nervous system, have been noted
to decrease with age.
They are also located near the blood
vessels in our brains so researchers
thought that they might be receiving
signals, not only from the nervous
system, but also from signaling factors
carried in the blood, and this may be
influencing their decline.
To test this idea they joined the
blood supplies of an old mouse (18
months, apparently the equivalent of
70 human years) and a young mouse
(only 3 months) together, and found
that this boosted the number of neu-
ral stem cells in the older mouse, in-
dicating that something in the young
blood was stimulating their growth.
They then simply injected old mice
with blood plasma from young mice,
and got similar results. Although it is
important to bear in mind the sample
size was only 8, the results suggest the
young blood had a significant effect
on cognition, with the old mice also
performing better on maze learning
and memory tests. But whilst some
researchers are calling for clinical tri-
als to see the effects on Alzheimer’s,
others are cautioning that we need to
identify what these ‘rejuvenating fac-
tors’ are first and shouldn’t get carried
away.
Excitingly, a team of researchers at
Harvard think they have identified
one. It’s a growth factor called GDF11,
found in our blood, and it’s levels de-
crease as we age. On top of that, this
protein is identical in both mice and
humans, so any effects on the mice
ought to be similar in us.
Injections of GDF11 have been
shown to increase the number of
blood vessels in our muscles, and to
improve the structure of older muscle
fibres that become more disorganized
with age. This might explain why
young blood appears to rejuvenate
muscle tissue and increase exercise
endurance.
There are also suggestions that
GDF11 reverses the effects of cardiac
hypertrophy in old mice. This is a form
of heart disease where the muscular
walls of the heart become stiff and less
efficient at pumping our blood, and a
characteristic of the disease is that the
heart increases in size.
After 10 weeks, the diseased hearts
of older mice had shrunk considerably
in size, suggesting the hypertrophy
had been reduced. However the
mechanism behind the process is
not fully understood and there are
still many questions, for example
would the shrinking have continued
indefinitely or levelled off at an
optimum size?
This paper has also been criticised
for focusing mainly on heart size
and not including other functional
heart tests. However, it is certainly a
promising start so watch this space for
possible future heart therapies!
Another idea is that the effects of
ageing occur because the number and
quality of our stem cells in various
tissues declines. Stem cells are special
because they can continuously renew
themselves, whilst also providing a
source of new cells for whichever
tissue they are part of. For example,
in our brain, neural stem cells will
keep dividing to renew or replace the
neurons in our brain. So if our neural
stem cells stop functioning with age,
this might explain why our cognitive
functions decline.
Whilst such research can potentially
offer life-saving therapies, where is
the line between preventing age-
associated diseases, and controlling
our life cycle? We all want to grow old
gracefully, but might this lead us to a
point where we don’t grow old at all,
and what other effects might this have
on society?
Overall, we’re still not sure exactly
what causes us to age. Theories range
from free radicals damaging our
cells, to our telomeres running out.
(Telomeres are excess bits of DNA
at the end of our chromosomes that
get shorter each time a cell divides).
In truth it’s probably a complicated
interaction between pre-programmed
bodily changes and our environment.
But what is clear is that age is a risk
factor for developing many other
diseases such as cancer, heart disease
and Alzheimer’s.
If we can understand the ageing
process then we might be able to
reduce the risk of developing these
diseases.
