T
he London 2012 Olympics
was not just a very fruitful
and lucrative opportunity
for the UK economy, which
benefitted from a £9.9bn
boost in trade and investment. It also
placed a huge responsibility on the
analytical chemists who had the job
of identifying the drug cheats and
keeping the Games fair.
Now, it seems, that the number
of people relying on these chemical
cheats for academic purposes is on the
rise too. However, just how beneficial
are these drugs for enhancing exam
performance?
According to a study presented
to the American Academy of
Paediatrics, 18% of the students at
an Ivy League College in the USA
reported to misuse of a prescription
stimulant (used normally in patients
with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder; ADHD) at least once
while studying, with 24% of students
admitting to have done so on eight or
more occasions. Not only that, but a
third of the students did not view this
misuse as actually “cheating”.
The use of such ‘cognitive
enhancing’ drugs has been a hotly
debated topic over the past few years,
especially with increasing widespread
prescription access to drugs such as
methylphenidate (Ritalin) and mixed
amphetamine salts (Adderall) being
used for non-medical (or worse,
academic) purposes due to claims
that these can increase concentration,
memory and allow prolonged periods
of attention whilst working.
Such classes of drugs are normally
used in medical practice for patients
with narcolepsy, fatigue, shift-work,
sleep apnoea (a form of sleep disorder)
and psychiatric disorders such as
ADHD. Of the 616 non-ADHD
sophomores sampled in the study,
69% of those who misused stimulants
did so to write an essay, 66% to study
for an exam and 27% to sit a test.
The survey showed that nearly
three times as many students who did
misuse ADHD stimulants thought
that this was a common practice on
their campus, compared to students
who did not. Evidence shows that at
some US universities, 7% of students
regularly use these drugs whilst
studying and the trend is expected to
increase in the near future.
Interestingly, these drugs are
believed to principally benefit (as far as
cognitive enhancement is concerned)
those individuals who already have
‘below average’ cognitive abilities. A
newer drug, modafinil, has shown
promise by inhibiting inappropriate
impulsive responses and improving
performance when fatigue sets in.
However, it has only significantly
improved certain types of memory
(pattern recognition memory) and
is associated with a multitude of
side effects. Some of the main side
effects of commonly used medication
include headache, nausea, dizziness,
sleeping problems and a decreased
appetite. Although well tolerated by
the vast majority of people taking
the medications, in under 10% of
those affected, these events can be
significant. Furthermore, the main
worry is of the unknown side effects
that these drugs may present with in
the future, with increased and more
widespread use. Although ADHD
patients may consider the side effects
of such medication reasonable, is this
justifiable in people who take them
recreationally or just to ‘pass exams’?
Principle investigator for the study
done in the Ivy League College,
Natalie Colaneri, agreed that this
issue needs to be “approached from
an interdisciplinary perspective: as
an issue relevant to the practice of
medicine, to higher education and
to ethics in modern-day society”.
Perhaps, we ought to introduce a
branch of the World Anti-Doping
Agency in schools as well, before the
summer exams.
A
new solar cell is
being pioneered
by researchers at
the Northwestern
University, USA.
Rather than using lead perovskite as
the conductor to harvest light, the
research team developed cells which
utilise tin. The research paper was
published in the Nature Photonics
journal earlier this week.
The main benefits of this structure
are the low cost of manufacture and
the fact that it is more environmentally
friendly, as lead compounds are often
hazardous and require specialist
equipment to use safely.
The team was led by Mercouri G.
Kanatzidis, an inorganic chemist, who
explained their choice of materials:
“Tin is a very viable material, and we
have shown the material does work
as an efficient solar cell.” Perovskite
is an oxide mineral which are being
used increasingly in the field of
photovoltaics. Lead perovskite solar
cells can achieve an efficiency of
15% and by replacing the lead in
the compound with tin, the team
hopes to match or even surpass this
benchmark.
While perovskite can appear
organically, Kanatzidis has been able
to synthesis a tin-iodide perovskite
compound. Collaborating with nano-
scientist Robert P. H. Chang, they set
about creating a working solar cell
from the material. The perovskite
materials are used as light harvesters
in the solar cell and using tin, the
research team noted that the charge
accumulates in the perovskite as well
as in the electrode contacts. This
led to a lower open-current voltage,
which could be tuned by substituting
iodide atoms with bromide.
Comparison tests were performed
between tin halide compounds
(notably iodide and bromine) with
lead counter parts. The optical
bandgap in the tin-iodide perovskite
compound was measured at 1.3 eV,
which is lower than the lead cells’ 1.55
eV. The absorption spectrum was also
red shifted to a higher wavelength of
950nm.
While their tests were only able to
reach efficiencies of just below 6%,
the manufacture process with these
new materials is an important starting
point, Kanatzidis believes. “Other
scientists will see what we have done
and improve on our methods, here is
no reason this new material can't reach
an efficiency better than 15 percent,
which is what the lead perovskite solar
cell offers.
Tin and lead are in the same group
in the periodic table, so we expect
similar results.”
