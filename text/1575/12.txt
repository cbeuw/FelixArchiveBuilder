Back in February, Felix ran an article
on the history of the female nude in art.
But what of the male? The female nude
is omnipresent and openly celebrated
in Western art; she adorns the walls of
today’s galleries, magisterially inviting
our appreciation. By contrast, her
male counterpart is overwhelmingly
underrepresented. Pendulous phalluses
are few and far between.
Historically, this was not always the
case. Until the 19th century, nudes
in Western art were predominantly
male. Over the centuries our society
has developed a double standard in
our attitude towards nudity – whilst
female nudity has become increasingly
accepted, that of the male has become
somewhat taboo. However, current
censorship of men’s bodies is a sad
reflection of the male nude’s illustrious
history in art.
The male nude was central to early
classical art; as a paragon of beauty and
embodiment of philosophical ideals.
Nudes such as Myron’s Discobolus 450-
460BC (a marble copy of which can be
seen at the British Museum) represent a

gym-goers today dream of attaining, his
muscular thighs and gleaming buttocks
symbols of his masculinity. To some
extent, such sculptures are imitations,
a reflection of everyday life in Ancient
Greece, where athletes traditionally
competed naked. However, to depict a
subject nude was also to venerate him -
sculptures of mythological heroes and
Gods stand naked alongside athletes.
As a society open to male sexuality
and homoeroticism, the Greeks saw
no shame in male nudity. By contrast,
until Praxiteles’ nude Aphrodite, female
deities in art were typically robed.
The introduction of Christianity
in Europe saw a decline in both male
and female nudes in art of the Middle
Ages, and perhaps set a precedent
for censorship of the male body.
Nude studies were only deemed
acceptable where necessary in religious
representations, marking an end to the
Greek and Roman exaltation of the male
form.
The Renaissance heralded his
return, as an idealised form to study
“mankind” in anatomical drawings, and
with the resurgence of neoclassicism.
However, with prevailing religious
ideals, depiction of the classical nude
had become problematic. Renaissance
Europe’s reverence for Greek ideology
and philosophy did not extend
to acceptance of male nudity and
homoeroticism. Nudes are not asexual
– the art historian Kenneth Clark said
“no nude…should fail to arouse in
the spectator some vestige of erotic
feeling… if it does not do so it is bad art”
.
But the majority of Renaissance artists
were male, and homosexual acts were
punishable by death.
Paradoxically, the threat of
religious censorship appeared to
liberate Renaissance artists in their
representation of the male nude. Many
religious paintings of the period are
at once erotically charged and violent
in their punishment of the male nude
for the sinful feelings he evoked in the
viewer;theripplingtorsoofBoticelliand
Mantenega’s St. Sebastian is studded
with arrows. Such works associated
the male nude with a new vulnerability
absent from the heroic nudes of classical
art.
Elsewhere, sensuality began to creep
into male nude artworks, providing
an outlet for homoerotic feelings
prohibited by society. Donatello’s David
sculpture, one of the first examples of
a classical male subject studied from
life, is overtly seductive. Hand on hips,
his come-hither stance and curvaceous
contours also break from traditional
depictions of the male nude. Threatened
by the emerging eroticism in male
nude artworks, the church continued
to censor them. Fra Bartolomeo’s
painting of St.Sebastian was removed
from a Florentine church after female
parishioners confessed to lusting
after him, and the Vatican famously
painted drapery over any offending
POETRY CORNER
Single Sheet
By Henry Bennie
That patch of lichen skin,
that resides between the male breasts,
familiar but alien.
His body was fresh above the sheets.
Afraid he was dead,
I watched his chest, waiting for the
Swell and ebb.
A squirm.
I was calm again.
Single bed,
double duvet.
Our bodies everywhere,
not sure which limb was mine, his.

March 16th
With peach sun bursting across the grey,
he was out on the water in his boat.
I, the shore.
Legs pushing, arms pulling, back arching
the boat rowed
farther into the further.
Slicing, cutting, progressing, approaching...
the other shore.
***
The morning dies for the afternoon,
the afternoon making space for the night, this
night:
My last night.
Single bed,
single sheet.
My body confined,
of confirmed location:
Unbound.
