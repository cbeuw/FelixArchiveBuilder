FRIDAY 09 MAY
COMMENT
S
ometimes, there are really
busy weeks, and sometimes
there are quiet weeks.
Sometimes there are
weeks that start of quiet
and then get a lot more complicated.
Sometimes many weeks are like these.
Sometimes you wish these weeks
were over. Sometimes you wish these
weeks weren’t the weeks that they
were.
Do you understand what I mean?
Do I?
Silliness aside (well mostly), one
has to fill a column somehow (and
apparently the old 1953 methods just
don’t cut it anymore), I’m sure that
you’ve experienced many weeks like
these, especially now, when many of
you are in the middle of, or impatiently
waiting for, exams.
This is a strange and confusing term
for Felix, since, like you, most of our
editors are busy with the stress of
exams, the pain of revision and the
mental gymnastics required to survive
an ordeal in the Sahara simulation
that is the 5th floor of the Central
Library (well at least for the time
being – see page 1 – if you haven’t
already, I assume you probably saw
it when you picked this issue up, or
read it online, or read the entire article
wittily condensed by some know-it-
all twitterati superstar into a twisted,
debauched 140 character version of its
former self).
This means that the Editor spends a
lot of time trying to work out who will
actually be available, what will come in
and how much extra they have to do, a
situation which leads to weird, slightly
transcendental articles like this.
This also, hopefully, explains why
our issues are shorter this term, since
after all we rely on your contributions
and astute observations to fill our
lovely papery pages.
Honestly, if we could, we would
ban all exams, and not just because it
would give you more time to submit
articles to our section editors (they get
fewer emails – trust me it’s better that
way), but also because as a student
population, we’ve been continually
tested since a very young age, wouldn’t
it be nice if we had a break one year,
before we actually have to get a job.
However, such is life.
Right, time to put on the opinionated
hat. Now I am the cat in the hat,
but not with capitals because then
that could cause a few legal issues.
Remember, it’s descriptive, not titular.
The initialisation of a process that
may bring cooling to the Central
Library? Good. Great. FANTASTIC!
Eurovison statistics you cry?
Engaging, interesting and amusing.
Summer Sun? Fabulous!
Mysterious filming last week?
Curious. Unusual. Who was it?
Oh, and just before you go: follow us
on snapchat @feliximperial.
Oh, and if you send anything funny,
we will screenshot it, and probably
publish it :)
Something important and totally
worth reading all the way through
