FRIDAY 09 MAY
FASHION
14 Met Gala: Beyond Fashion
place in New York City, and its famous guests wowed us with their style
on, gave guests the opportunity to dress over the top! From Lupita Nyong’o’s
oppulent jewel toned gown, here are the highlights from the night.
Hailee Steinfeld
Hailee Steinfeld channeled understated chic in her Prabal Gurung
black and white gown. Her satin Charlotte Olympia shoes polished
off the look. It would have bee nice to see more jewelery on her
to dress up the look, but otherwise, the 17 year-old pulled off the
mature look.
Emma Stone
Emma Stone chose to be alternative and wore a Thakoon crop top
and skirt instead of a ball gown, teamed with a Tod’s clutch. The two
tones of pink looked very pretty on her fair skin, but the look was a
bit casual for THE fashion event of the year!
Lea Michele
Did Lea Michele dress like an Oscar? The glee star shone in
this golden gown by Joseph Altuzarra. Metro online put her
on their worst dressed list, but Oscar looke...woops, I mean
Lea, looked fabulous in the shimerring dress.
