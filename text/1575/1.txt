“Keep the
Cat Free”
After many years of complaints from
students regarding the sweltering
heat on the top floors of the Central
Library, Felix is happy to announce
that College has finally responded
by providing air conditioning in the
library.
According to documents filed with
the City of Westminster Council
by Savills on behalf of college, the
application asks from Planning
Permission for the ‘erection of
ventilation roof plant and associated
ducting to serve the Central Library’.
The proposed chilling machinery will
be built on the roof of the Sherfield
Building. At 11 metres in length and
almost 3 metres high, the plant will
take up a volume of 68 cubic metres,
and will be connected to the library
by ductwork that will mostly be built
internally.
As the planning application notes,
“The library has long suffered with
overheating issues, most notably
duringsummerspellsofwarmweather
where the largely glazed building
suffers from solar heating, resulting in
working conditions unsuitable for the
study areas.”
This will hopefully be a great relief
to the hundreds of students who have
tried to revise in the library during
each summer examination period, and
may bring to an end the rite of passage
of smuggling a fan into the library for
some desperate students.
We spoke to Marissa Lewis, the
Union’s Deputy President (Welfare),
who said: “The temperature in the
library is a common complaint from
students, especially during the already
stressful exam season – it’s fantastic
news that this is going to get fixed…
it’s a really cool idea.”
We approached College and asked
why it had taken so long to make
changes to the Library cooling system.
A College Spokesperson replied, “The
College conducted a survey last year
which identified temperature control
as the improvement most sought by
student users of the Central Library
on the South Kensington Campus.
Imperial is currently applying for
the necessary planning permission to
install climate-control in the Library.
The timeframe for installation has not
yet been established. Library users will
be kept informed of plans once the
likely start date for the work has been
determined”
Felix is just happy that College has stopped
giving students the cold shoulder. -Ed.

Library Inches Closer Towards Air Conditioning
College submits planning application to Westminster
Council for cooling plant on roof of Sherfield Building
I
n a Superdrug study of sexual
health provision by universities
nationwide College was rated
14th and provided with a 2:1
classification.
Using a list of the top 50 universities
(as listed by the Good University
Guide), Superdrug rated them against
nine criteria regarding sexual health
provision for students.
Receiving 63 points, a full 17 points
behind table leaders Bristol University,
College’s lowest score, F, was received
in Sexual Health Information Found
On Campus, while College received a
D for the ease of finding sexual health
information on its website.
In total seven universities received
a ‘first class degree’ from Superdrug’s
Online Doctor, while half of the group
received a 2:1 or better.
Someofthemainproblemsobserved
by the researchers compiling the table
included the fact the universities were
often not involved in sexual health
campaigns or provision, leaving it to
elected welfare officers who change
every year. Also, they pointed out
that while many universities provide a
good sexual health service, they often
don’t promote it enough or do not give
detailed information.
