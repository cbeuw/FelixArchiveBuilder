A
ccording to the
Metro, London’s
“thinnest” house
is to undergo
surgery after
council inspectors ruled that
it does not not meet housing
standards.
The makeshift house, situated
in Waltham Forest will have to
be destroyed within 3 months,
despite appeals by owners Zim
Properties.
Tat fails to impress
Surrey resident Bradlet Holman
recently received his 15 minutes
of fame after showing off a new
tattoo.
Holman, while on holiday in
Malia, Crete was inked with a
tattoo of the Nando’s logo on
his right buttock, in the hope of
receiving a legendary “Nando’s
Black Card” that provides the
holder with free chicken for life.
Nando’s did not play ball.
Holman has since threatened to
replace his tattoo with the logo
for KFC...
Here’s some
extra joy we
managed to
find...
