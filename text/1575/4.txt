Oxford Union President Arrested
A
ccording to the
Tab Oxford, this
week the Oxford
Union President
Ben Sullivan
was arrested by Police and
questioned concerning
allegations over an incident of
rape and another of attempted
rape.
Sullivan was woken up by police
at 7.10 AM on Wednesday
morning and was released on
bail until June 18.
This news follows recent turmoil
in Oxford’s debating Union,
which has led to the resignation
of two officers under Sullivan’s
command after Sullivan attempt
to use the society’s money to
stop the press printing a story
about his membership of an elite
Christ Church College drinking
club.
The allegations, which were later
covered by the Times, accused
Sullivan of belonging to the
Banter Squadron, an “informal”
elite drinking society. Sullivan
attempted to use £1,200 of
Union members’ money to stop
the press, and later was forced
to admit membership after this
attempt failed and the press
refused to accept information
about blackmail incidents
involving other members of the
Oxford Union.
In a statement to the press,
Sullivan later reverted his story,
claiming “I said I was not aware
of what the ‘Banter Squadron’
was and that I had never been
a ‘member’ because the idea
that the ‘Banter Squadron’ is a
formal organisation is frankly
ridiculous.
The phrase is an ironic term
that has sometimes been used
to ­
refer to our group of friends.
I apologise for not being more
clear ­originally.”

ccording to a
report published
by the House of
Lords Economics
Affairs Committee,
PM David Cameron should
establish a cabinet committee
dedicated to fracking.
In the report, the Lords’
committee mentioned that the
UK has shale reserves that could
provide 40 years worth of UK gas
comsumption, providing energy
security and possibly 250,000
jobs.
However, the peers were
concerned that the Environment
Agency had not received any
new applications for fracking
permits since the temporary UK
fracking ban in 2012 triggered
by a potentially fracking-related
earthquake caused by Cuadrilla
Resources during an exploration
operation in Lancashire.
The peers also support changes
to trespass laws which would
allow companies to carry out
hydraulic fracturing operations
under people’s properties
without consent.

Political smear
campaigns off to a
good start
T
he last fortnight
has seen a several
interesting points
in the run-up to the
May 22 European
Parliament elections.
From the not-so-secret BNP
“banned” party politcal
broadcast that bore all the
hallmarks of an attention-
grabbing viral-flopping low
budget flick to Labour’s
over-produced video about
Nick Clegg the “Un-amazing
shrinking man” parties are
seemingly anxious to engage
and amuse voters, rather than
spending time explaining their
policies. Let the games, begin!
Lost something?
O
n Sunday the
Twitter account
run by Burnley
Police station
tried to inject
a bit of humour into the early
morning shift, tweeting
“Anyone lost a huge amount of
cannabis in the Burnley area?
Don’t panic, we found it! Pop
in to the station to collect it..
#we’rewaiting”.
Officers, clearly bored with the
lack of evening entertainment
provided by their job followed
up with a tweet late that evening
providing an interesting offer:
“#specialoffer free overnight
accommodation, in walking
distance of local shops & each
room has a nice selection of
bars! #anytakers #free”
