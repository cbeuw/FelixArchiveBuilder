This week, you buy a Summer
Ball ticket, and realise with a
heavy heart you just spent a
week’s worth of food money to
see a man plug in his MacBook
into some speakers and run
some shitty iTunes playlist. Still,
it is better than wanking slowly
and solitarily at home on a
Saturday night.
This week, you go to
Nottingham Trent Student
Union’s club night, called
Climax. You alternate your
time there either sniggering
at the transparent innuendo
in the club night name or
abusing their twitter wall,
trying to distract yourself how
amazing your nightlife could
have been if you had been
forced into clearing.
This week, you receive an
email, 1000 words strong,
listing every single fault
someone has found with you.
You quietly close the laptop,
sigh, and then proceed
to slowly and purposely
masturbate over the letter.
Perverted masochism has
never tasted so sweet.
This week, you are an
Oxbridge Union President,
sitting in a jail cell, waiting
for sentencing. You attempt
to contact the union to pay
for your bail, but the budget
allocated for student bail this
year was already blown, both
literally and figuratively. Tough
call buddy.
This week, you are living in the
library, not because of exams,
but because your housemate
has started spanking his
girlfriend loudly and regularly
enough to lead to a dent
in your sleeping schedule.
Since it was cheaper to buy a
sleeping bag than a paddle to
join in, the library is now your
home.
This week you are Avril
Lavigne and decide to charge
fans $400 for photos with you.
You keep fans an arm’s length
away because the constant
dying of you hair has resulted
in it emitting radioactive
isotopes. This way, their
lives, already vapid due to
being fans of your music,
can continue for a few years
longer.
This week you are tutoring
teenagers A Level chemistry
for some extra money, and one
confides in you that they want
to attend Imperial. You promise
them a fictitious land of fun,
frivolity, friendship and fucking,
as if you are to graduate a
virgin, a virgin should at least
take your place.
This week you are living in the
library, and have decided to
catch one of those mice that
run around late at night, as all
your money has been spent on
the chicken kievs made from
cardboard. You trap the poor
creature and bite down on it,
realising sadly it still contains
more meat than the chicken
kievs.
This week, your former
teachers have been arrested
in a national scandal that
shocked the country. Maybe
it was a bad idea to pose for
those pictures in return for
some decent A-level grade
predictions, but hey, at least it
got you into Imperial.
This week, you tremble into
life as a woman grabs you
firmly and rubs a delicious
concoction of musk and mint
into your supple form. You rise
into the air, and look down on
the most beautiful face you
have ever seen in your life. You
realise, in horror, that you are a
dildo.
This week you attempt the trip
to the Felix Office. After climing
up six flights of stairs you make
up to the top floor of the Union,
only to trip on the hem of your
trendily ripped jeans. You fall
back down the stairs, only to
end up head over heels in the
Union kitchens, surrounded
by mutant rats.
This week your horoscope
writer ran out of inspiration.
Hey, it happens! This isn’t
an easy job you know! The
pressure of the expectations
of thousands of fellow Zodiac
prophesizing professionals
worldwide is a lot to meausure
up to! And then there’s you lot!

Russians Rocked By
Eurovision Booing
A
s the domestic season
ends and the World
Cup approaches,
England players
everywhere are making
desperate attempts to get themselves
just injured enough so as to miss
another embarrassing tournament.
Phil Jones is so scared of international
humiliation that he’s pulled his
own arm out of his shoulder.
Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney – who
has tried everything in the past
from injuries, making sure England
don’t even qualify and last minute
pointless red cards – is hurriedly
trying to pick up a niggle that will
rule him out of the first to games
only for him to return once England
have already been knocked out.
Some players have had to try more
drastic attempts, Walcott has got
himself a long term injury whilst
Andros Townsend has made sure
he won’t even be in consideration
by playing terribly since October.
Putin Backs Down After Western
Show of Power
F
ollowing the booing of the Russia
act at the Eurovision semi-finals,
Putin has stated that the West
has shown a “level of aggression and
strength no one thought possible”
“I did not think they had in them to
defy me and my expansionist tactics
like this.”
“I will, of course, withdraw all troops
from Ukrainian territory. In fact, the
only safe thing to do is to disband
most of the army, because I fear that
if we do not, we face ceaseless booing
in the final”.
“I will not let that happen to my
people”.
President of the European Council,
Herman Van Rompuy, defended the
booing in a statement to the press,
“we felt Russian aggression could only
be curtailed by an extreme show of
strength”
“Whilst we all regret the damage done
to Russian civilians and Russian pride,
such punishing actions are the only
way to make our message very clear
to Putin”
“We will stop at nothing to defend
Ukrainian sovereignty”
At press time, US president Barack
Obama is considering whether it
would be worth sending American
troops to the Eurovision final in order
to create highly professional and
highly coordinated boos.
It is hoped that simply threatening
such a move will force Putin into
destroying Russia’s entire nuclear
arsenal, make them like gays and force
them to supply Europe with cheap fuel
indefinitely.
