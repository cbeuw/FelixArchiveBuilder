An inconvenient truth
It’s a great shame that Yari Film Group
Releasing had to declare bankruptcy
just before the release of Nothing but
the Truth. This meant that the sharp-
ly-written, well-acted, legal/political
thriller would never get a proper wide
release date in the States or anywhere
else in the world. A film that was try-
ing to angle an Oscar nomination for
its leading lady Kate Beckinsale, that
opportunity was of course thrown out
the window along with any hopes of
significant financial profit. A quiet
DVD release was the ultimate, unde-
serving fate the film had to embrace
and a region 2 version release in the
U.K. is finally here.
Rachel Armstrong (Beckinsale) is
a reporter for the Capital Sun-Times
working on the biggest story of her ca-
reer, a story big and powerful enough
to take down the President. She has
written an article outing a covert
C.I.A operative Erica Van Doren (Vera
Farmiga) and her detailed mission re-
port that was completely disregarded
by the White House when ordering
a military strike against Venezuela.
The government, desperate to cover
up their tracks, acts immediately, ap-
prehending Armstrong, forcing her
to give up her source. With her prin-
ciples and journalist’s integrity on the
line, she refuses to cooperate. Treated
as a treasonous offense, she is held
in contempt of court, ends up in jail
and sparks a controversy that starts
affecting her family and obviously,
her career. But when it’s National Se-
curity on the line, all bets are off and
she knows the government will never
back down easily. It’s a battle between
the First Amendment and National
Security.
Inspired by the case of Judith Mill-
er, an ex-journalist for the New York
Times whose coverage of Iraq’s al-
leged Weapons of Mass Destruction
program both before and after the
invasion landed her in jail for a few
months, “Nothing but the Truth”
immediately benefits from having a

currently relevant, intriguing source
material. The topic itself can spark
off a debate that can easily last for
days. What’s more important? The
reporter’s loyal duty of privileged
and confidential information to his/
her source or the country’s needs?
Would you sacrifice your honour for a
government that constantly lies to its
citizens that ultimately lands them in
more trouble than ever before? This
heated political debate is forever on-
going and the film leaves the audience
to think for themselves. Some may
end up being frustrated at Armstrong,
for being so stubborn and unpatriotic,
whereas others might praise her and
cheer on her bravery to stand on her
own two feet to fight off the manipula-
tive forces of the government.
Director Rod Lurie, despite tackling
a big controversial political argument,
makes this film as much about the
people involved, not the complicated
subject matter. He keeps the events
small-scale and intimate, more about
how these characters interact with
each other, and how this case starts
to influence Rachel and those around
her. The various characters all have
individuality, no crucial character is
side-lined and with no nonsense style
of writing, the sharp, comprehensible,
snappy dialogue builds plenty of sus-
pense without having to extend the
plot into an unmanageable size.
Beckinsale is spot-on as the protag-
onist, caught in a major moral dilem-
ma, the well-known pressure of being
a working mother piling up faster than
ever all because of this sticky situation.
On the one hand, she’s the honour-
able, selfless journalist trying to do the
right thing, protecting the newspaper,
her source but on the other hand, she
has the endless temptation to come
clean, to be near her beloved husband
and son: Beckinsale has absolutely no
trouble showing us both the strength
and weakness of the character and
it’s possible she would have garnered
some nominations had this film been

he announcement that
a movie based around
everyone’s favourite line
of construction toys was
met with rants about the
extent of consumerism in cinema.
However, cynics will be pleasantly
surprised by the actual film that has
emerged which has garnered near
universal acclaim for its beautiful
animation, charming humour and
hilarious send up of the ‘traditional’
Hollywood blockbuster.
Everyman (toy) Emmet is a fairly
talentless construction worker in
Bricksburg who after accidentally
falling into a hole, discovers an
unusual piece of red lego-the ‘piece
of resistance’ purported to be able to
stop the evil Lord Business. Emmet
is soon declared to be ‘the special’
based on an old prophecy. Even when
later on this prophecy turns out to
just be a load of hot air, Emmet is
still tasked with saving toykind from
Business’ evil clutches.

released properly.
There are many familiar faces that
fill the screen. Matt Dillon, a teen idol
in the 80s is the main prosecutor in
charge of getting Armstrong to con-
fess, Academy Award nominee An-
gela Bassett plays Armstrong’s boss
at the Capital Sun-Times, supporting
her employee as well as trying to pro-
tect the newspaper’s reputation, E.R.’s
Noah Wyle is the legal counsel to the
newspaper, Friends’ David Schwim-
mer, taking on his first dramatic role
since 2001 is Armstrong’s husband
and the legendary Alan Alda is the
lawyer defending our journalist. The
ensemble works to an extraordinary
level with not one performance out
of place or at fault. Dillon can be one
smug, hateful litigator but we’re re-
minded that he’s doing his job in seek-
ing justice, a man truly concerned over
the welfare of the country’s National
Security. Farmiga, always a reliable
actress in both leading and supporting
roles, shows both fear and frustration
towards this whole situation that’s also
making the government question her
loyalty to the agency. Schwimmer’s
character starts as the reliable, sup-
portive husband but as the case drags
on and on, we see him lose his faith,
being disappointed in Rachel that she
would choose her job over her family,
and these emotions are portrayed so
well by someone we only mainly knew
as a comedy actor.
The final revelation, a shocking
twist which turns out to be a more
than plausible and satisfying explana-
tion to Rachel’s never-ending quest
to protect her source, is definitely an
unexpected and intelligent one that
puts a nice ending to one of the most
thought-provoking and socially rel-
evant films that disappointingly went
unnoticed. There are many straight-
to-DVD gems out there, ones that un-
fortunately did not have the right cir-
cumstances to get a wide release. This
is one of those films, an unmissable,
thrilling treat.
