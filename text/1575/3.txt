This week 2,700 students graduated
from various postgraduate course in
the Royal Albert Hall.
The ceremony, held on Wednesday,
was the last postgraduate graduation
event held in the history of Imperial,
students received their degrees while
observed by an audience of 6,000
supporters, spread over three sessions
throughout the day.
As with the undergraduate
ceremony the Union President David
Goldsmith gave a speech to the
graduating students, and each shook
the hand of President and Rector Sir
Keith O’Nions.
In a speech, Sir Keith said, “Each of
you has been at the frontier of your
subject. You have pushed, tested and
in many cases moved the boundaries
of knowledge and achieved a new level
of understanding. The full impact of
your achievements and success will
unfold down the years as your careers
develop further.”
The day also saw honours being
conferred on several notable
academics, with Professor Dudley
Brian Spalding FRS, FRAE, retired
Professor of Heat Transfer receiving
an honorary degree in recognition
of his research into Computational
Fluid Dynamics, followed by Dr
Rodney Eastward, a former College
Secretary, upon whom was conferred
an Imperial College Medal for
outstanding contribution to the life
and work of the College.
S
tatisticians at UCL and
Imperial College London
have found that contrary to
popular belief UK entries
to Eurovision have not
been “systematically shunned” by the
rest of Europe. Statistical analysis of
voting patterns have shown that while
there is more to winning than just
musical talent, there is little evidence
to back up Terry Wogan’s claim that
the song contest has issues of bias and
discrimination. The study, published
in Journal of Applied Statistics,
analysed how countries voted since
Eurovision introduced televoting in
1998.
The results of the statistical analysis
showed virtually zero negative bias.
There was no evidence of prejudice
or discrimination against anyone as
the study demonstrated that countries
didn’t systematically give low points to
other countries.
Voting patterns may instead be
motivated by positive loyalties based
on culture, geography, history and
migration. Dr Gianluca Baio, one of
the lead authors of the paper, said:
“Migration seems to be an interesting
explanation for some of the patterns
that we see in the data. For example,
Turkey seems to be scored highly
by German voters, possibly due to
the large number of Turkish people
who have migrated to Germany, and
potentiallytelevotefromthere.Butour
analysis found no convincing evidence
of negative bias or discrimination
against anyone – no country really has
any enemies.”
“In our analysis we used what we call
a ‘Bayesian hierarchical formulation’
to model the scores,” explained co-
author Dr Marta Blangiardo. “We
took into account factors like the
language of the song and the gender of
the singer both of which have known
effects on the votes. This left behind
an underlying trend for us to measure.
This trend is based on cultural and
geographical similarities, as well as
migrations of people.”
Bayesian hierarchical formulations
are a powerful statistical tool, which
properly accounts for underlying
correlations in the observed data.
This model allows scientists to focus
on repeated voting behaviour over
the years, rather than one-off factors.
However, while statistical methods
can identify trends in the data,
they cannot directly tell us about
the underlying causes for people’s
motivation to vote a certain way.
“The observed data can only suggest
whether there is bias, and there can
be many reasons for this,” Baio says.
“To prove something stronger like
‘discrimination’ or ‘favouritism’, we
would need more complex data,
for example polling on people’s
motivations for voting the way they
do.”
Eurovision 2014 is being held in
Copenhagen, with the final taking
place on Saturday 10 May.
The UK entry, “Children of the
Universe” sung by Molly Smitten-
Downes was written especially for this
years competition, the 59th Eurovision
Song Contest.
Dr. Marta Blangiardo is a lecture
in Biostatics in the Deptartment of
Epidmiology and Biostatics.
