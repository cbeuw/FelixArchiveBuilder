Felix Food brings happiness to revision with cake
P
rocrastinating from work,
I found myself looking
at my Instagram stream,
and I was quite surprised
how many photos of food
I had in my history. I’ve got to admit,
not everything looked amazing, be
it the colour reproduction of my
phone (curry is not the most pleasant-
looking dish ever), or just the lack of
lighting in a restaurant.
A few issues ago we reported that
some Michelin-star chefs hated food
porn that much that they banned
cameras in their restaurants. In
South Africa though, they take a
much different policy. A restaurant
in Cape Town has introduced a new
“DinnerCam”, which can only be
described as a portable photo studio,
but for food. It was actually used as
a marketing tool for a local telecom’s
new unlimited WiFi plan, you can use
it if you are signed up to the plan. And
if you post the photo with the hashtag,
it will get printed for you to take away!
Personally I think it is pretty neat,
someone just needs to mass produce
these and make a fortune!
Some things are just
not meant to be…
I went to visit the family over
the bank holiday weekend and my
auntie got me a pack of chocolate
wasabi peas. It is part of the Marks &
Spencers Summer of Flavour range,
other things include fruit jellies,
caramel sweets and even ‘Mad Frogs’,
but nothing as adventurous as the
peas. My first impression was “meh...
that sounds weird”, and my feelings
sustained when I was biting through
my first one.
For those of you who don’t know
much about wasabi (do you even
exist?), it is essentially the Japanese
version of mustard. You might have
had some when you last had sashimi
or sushi. I am a big fan of wasabi,
especially the kick it provides you
with which goes straight up your
nose. I am also a big fan of chocolate,
especially how it just melts in your
mouth and the “gooey” sensation.
And who would hate peas? Nutritious,
cheap and tastes amazing! Putting all
three together though, not so much.
I’m surprised to find that this idea
even made it on kickstarter in 2012
and $5000 was actually raised with 47
people backing the project!
When I shared the peas amongst
my friends, there were mixed reviews.
Some did like the sensation of spicy
chocolate – I suppose it’s just a
preference thing. Lately I’m really into
salted caramel – something which
again, sounds so wrong, but I actually
like it! Although perhaps we can also
take a philosophical view on this,
don’t feel beaten if exams or projects
aren’t going too well, don’t give up and
keep going!
Some things are just not meant to
be but keep trying – I still have high
hopes for the future range of weird
M&S snacks! Or I can put it in the
words of Nev, the CEO of the BBC
Three show ‘The Call Centre’, “Some
will, some won’t, so what? Next.”
This week’s food for thought
#Felixfood
Someone left their breakfast on Bayswater Road
W
ho doesn’t like
cake? Even
Latvia’s entry
to this year’s
Eurovision was
all about this sweet, fluffy and tasty
food! It is a wide misconception to
think cakes are hard to bake and it
takes up a long time. But we are here
to prove that wrong.
Yes, baking a beautiful cake might
take patience and expertise, but if you
just want some cake to satisfy your
sweet tooth, it feels more like a science
experiment.Essentiallyit’sjustmixing,
measuring and shoving the whole
thing into the oven! Here are two easy
and tasty recipes, which can be made
with just a few cupboard ingredients.
The Magic Custard Cake
The magic comes with 3 layers
of this bake, with just one batter!
Ingredients
Four medium eggs
One tsp lemon juice
150g caster sugar
110g unsalted butter, melted
120g plain flour
480ml whole milk
One orange
Preheat an oven to 160°C and line
a deep baking tray or a cake tin with
baking paper. Separate the eggs and
whisk the whites to a stiff peak with
a tiny drop of lemon juice. Beat the
egg yolks with the sugar and one
tablespoon of warm water for a couple
of minutes then add the melted butter
and zest of the orange and mix again.
Sieve in the flour and stir through
the milk, then fold in the egg whites (in
two batches), until evenly combined.
Pour the batter into the baking
tin and cook for 50-60 minutes until
the top is golden and puffed and the
middle is set but with a generous
wobble.
Allow to cool completely (at least
three to four hours) before slicing into
the cake.
Green Tea Cake
(if you want something lighter)
Ingredients
Three large eggs
85 g sugar
Three tbsps vegetable oil
Four tbsp water
75 g cake flour
One heaped tbsp matcha powder
One tsp baking powder
Preheat oven to 170°C. In a large
bowl, whisk egg yolks and add ⅓ of the
sugar. Then add oil and water in the
mixture and mix it all together until
combined.
Sift cake flour, matcha and baking
powder together and add to the egg
yolk mixture in three batches. Whisk
until there are no lumps.
Whip the egg whites until opaque
andfoamy,thenadd⅓oftheremaining
sugar and continue whipping. Add
the remaining sugar slowly in small
increments until stiff peaks
Pull up your whisk and see if you
can make a strong ‘peak’ to check if
the mixture is stiff enough. It should
stay up still without bending down.
Fold in the beaten egg whites into
the flour mixture using spatula until
the colour is consistent in the mixture.
Pour the mixture into a greased
cake pan and tap it a few times on the
kitchen top to release the air bubbles.
Bake for 30 minutes or until when
you put a skewer in, it comes out clean.
