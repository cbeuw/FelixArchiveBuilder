Turns Out Union President Doing OK
F
ollowing the news that the
president of the influential
debating society, the Oxford
Union tried to gag the press
and was arrested under
suspicion of rape, it turns out that
Imperial Union president, David
Goldsmith, is probably doing ok.
Whilst rumours have regularly
surfaced that Goldsmith has
actually done very little this year
– bar collecting his monthly pay
A
ccording to the latest
in-library sources,
exam season 2014
is really hotting up.
There are, allegedly,
several small camps of revisers
beginning to appear in the darkest
corners. Indeed, the furthest reaches
of the group room face almost two
months of ceaseless occupation.
Higher up, the temperature is
literally being raised as more and
more students squash themselves
into the already sweltering 4th floor.
Meanwhile, it has been reported –
quietly – that the silence in the silent
sections has become all-consuming.
There have already been several
instances of violent arguments over
rare textbooks and the comfy chairs
and Hangman can only hope we avoid
thebrutalandtragic2012examseason.
At press time sources confirmed
that the Saturday morning queues
have skyrocketed from the off-
exam average of around 10 to
term’s best of roughly 8,000.
cheque – it has to be said that he’s
probably doing a better job than Ben
Sullivan, Oxford Union president.
“Sure, he’s not been the most actively
engaged or passionate of student
union presidents, but hey, at least
he hasn’t just been apprehended
by the police” said one student.
“Yeah ok, we’ve all heard that the
Union staff don’t trust Goldsmith with
any important tasks and yeah it’s been
a very quiet year for Union presence,
although I certainly couldn’t accuse
himofusingUnionfundstocrackdown
on the press” the student continued.

I
n the Office, Bored - Following
no controversial or interesting
news this week, this editor
believes everyone should
be striving to do more
controversial things more regularly.
Frankly, everyone is making my job
extremely difficult this week. Sure,
we could write about another racist/
sexist UKIP candidate, but we can’t
very well adopt a controversial
view with this new because that
would essentially amount to saying
vacuous racist or misogynistic sexist
things. And that would be wrong.
Certainlywecan’twriteaboutanything
happening at uni this week, because
basically nothing has happened (as per
the norm). And yes, we could write
local stuff for example about the tube
strikes. But, we’ve already written a
Tube-based editorial and to be honest,
we’re not sure it went down that well.
So, really, it would be really good if you,
or anyone, would pluck up the courage
to say something almost unforgiveable
but with just enough wriggle room
that we here at Hangman could write
something mean about it or back it up.
Somesuggestions–andthisreallyisoff
the top of our head(s) – someone could
suggest a law banning Marmite. Or
maybe there’s someone out there who
thinks we should give state funerals to
all cats. These are just ideas, they could
of course be something much better.
So, get your crazy hat on; take a break
from the hopeless cause that is your
revision and say something, in the
public arena, very, very controversial
because Hangman needs you.

Hangman’s undercover reporters in
the union were able to discover very
little about clandestine or illegal
activities, or indeed any activities at all.
Exam Season
Simmering
Nicely
Cardiff City vs Chelsea
This match is a dead rubber as
Chelsea are playing awa from home
so will almost certainly be parking
several buses to stop any attacks
from relegated Cardiff. The Bluebirds
will be easily identifiable from their
red kits and I therefore fully expect
them to pick up a meaningless yet
heartnening win.
Prediction: 4-1
Fulham vs Crystal Palace
Following their inspired ‘Crystanbul’
comeback against Liverpool last
week, Palace are on a roll. Therefore,
they shall ensure that they find
themselves 3-0 down with 12
minutes to go. Fulham are a bit shit
owing largely to their rubbish players
and a lack of Michael Jackson, but
their fans could use a win.
Prediction: 8-5
Hull City vs Everton
FA cup finalists Hull have no time
for Everton in this final day match
and duly swat them like an old man
bothered by flies.
Prediction: 2-1
Liverpool vs Newcastle Utd
Newcastle significantly hampered
themselves in 2014 by agreeing to
only actually try in the first have of
the season.
Liverpool could yet win the title
but that would require a huge favour
from West Ham and they hate
handing out favours even though
they definitely still owe the Reds for
that time they got the Hammers out
of that thing with that guy.
Prediction 10-5
Man City vs West Ham Utd
With Man City are expecting to
win the title and they will almost
certainly achieve it. However, the
hate winning the title by clear points
instead preferring to rub their
adversaries noses in it by taking the
title by virtue of a slightly superior
goal difference.
In this vein, I fully expect them to
be 1-2 down until the 95th minute
when James Milner (who else?) will
pop up with a 50 yard screamer.
Prediction: 2-2
Norwich vs Arsenal
Norwich have been really, really a bit
rubbish all season but then again so
have Arsenal in the Big Games. And
this is a Big Game. There’s no game
Bigger than one in which neither
team can move position not matter
what this result is or what any other
teams result is. What a game.
Prediction: 0-0
Southampton vs Man Utd
A battle of mid-table, mediocre
wills. That’s right, neither team
has anything to play for and
forever to play it in. In fact, the
most exciting thing to watch out
for in this match is whether Ryan
Giggs will bring himself on only
to be immediately subbed off by
Phil Neville. For that alone, this is
probably the game to watch.
Prediction: 2-1
Sunderland vs Swansea City
This is going to be a shit game ok?
Listen we would love it if all the
games every weekend were great
and meaningful, but that’s simply
not the case. Lets just fucking get
this prediction over with.
Prediction: 2-fucking-1
Tottenham Hotspur vs Aston Villa
Whatever else happens this game,
we can tell you that Spurs will
not be playing any of their most
expensive signings but will be
playing Michael Dawson for some
reason. God, that guy’s awful.
Anyway look forward to some
great sweeper-keeping, some
terrible Villa play and Paul
Lambert’s imminent sacking.
Prediction 5-5
WestBromichAlbionvsStokeCity
Essentially, the last day of the
season is going to be extremely
boring unless your a Man City fan.
I guess that’s the nature of a 38
game league, you are just going to
have seasons where the final day of
the season throws up both boring
fixtures and boring scenarios.
I mean sure, this game may be
watched by a few West Brom fans
and, of course, the statisticians
both of whom are fascinated that
West Brom managed to stay up
despite basically not winning any
games all season.
But other than that, it’s the
deadest of dead rubbers, like the
kind you’d find on the back of an
old pencil. You know, the sort of
rubber that never really worked
anyway and that you probably
chewed off or cut away with the
blade of the pencil sharpener.
Anyway, I probably ought to give
a prediction for this although it
really makes very little difference
to anything or anyway, especially
not to West Brom or Stoke fans.
Prediction: 1-2
David Goldsmith, not doing anything
agains the law, but also not doing
much at all.
