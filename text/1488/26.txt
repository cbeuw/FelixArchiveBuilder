CLUBS & SOCIETIES
FELIX
26 Friday 13 MAY 2011
What kind of city do we live in? The
London social calendar is full of aw-
fully pretentious events charging lu-
dicrous amounts of dosh for a very
ordinary experience whilst managing
to be incredibly vile and unwelcoming
about it at the same time. Events where
the lighting has that weird, trendy glow
that occasionally reveals the semen-ink
words ‘reclusive wanker’ on the trou-
sers of the dismally self-important cli-
entele. Events where the barman claims
to make the best Bellini cocktail in the
world outside of Venice, with all the
pomp and disillusionment Nick Griffin
that uses to claim he’s the best guy to
deal with immigration. Events that are
cynical, tacky, dunderheaded, and deca-
dent.
Equally, at the other end of the life-
style spectrum, you can blub your eyes
out watching – for the price of a TV li-
cence – a Frenchman make it through to
the next round of Britain’s Got Talent.
Which is really, really tragic. I could
pontificate on what is the biggest con-
tradiction in terms since Britney Spears
released her Greatest Hits album, but
frankly life’s too short. It’s basically a
show that pays no more attention to real
aptitude than the Pakistani intelligence
services do to detail.
So that’s the problem, the Bin Laden
gulf in al-Qaeda, if you will. London
needs an affordable variety show that
is fun and laid-back. A show that buoys
everybody’s mood, that embraces the
love of friends, and the eternal, undying
passion for brilliantly honest entertain-
ment. Enter stage left, Fusion. A music,
fashion, and dance show that originates
from York University, where it attracts
an audience of over 4000 people every
year and high-profile sponsors such
as KPMG and Hugo Boss. Fusion is
to now be launched in London for the
first time, offering the advantages of a
big city and the collaborative involve-
ment of students from Imperial College,
Queen Mary University, Kings College,
and UCL.
Fusion is a totally authentic way of
hosting a variety performance. It’s a
creative amalgamation of artistic skills
ranging from choreography, to music
compilation, to graphics and web de-
sign. It is a show entirely organised and
performed by students. A show that typ-
Finally, some fun!
Students from all over London come together to
bring Fusion, York University’s hugely successful
music, fashion, and dance show, to the capital
A call for recipes
Did you know that 30% of all food in
the UK is wasted?
Five Imperial College students are
trying to help prevent this by devel-
oping a Smartphone Application
and they need YOUR help. The App,
called Morph My Food, will allow
users to enter leftover ingredients
from their fridge /cupboards and will
then generate a selection of reci-
pes. A simple idea that could help
reduce food waste globally!!
You can help by submitting any
simple, creative and fun recipes
that can be created from typical left-
over ingredients in your own fridge
at on Facebook (search ‘Morph My
Food’). Or submit via email at mor-
phmyfood@gmail.com

primary aim is to raise as much money
as possible for charity.
It’s an old French cliché that youth is
wasted on the young – this show goes to
prove otherwise. For the passionate and
driven individuals who want to make a
difference and contribute to this unique
event, this is their chance to join the
committee. For those involved, being a
committee member of an such an event
in its first year would be hard work but
would also prove a great way of mak-
ing new friends, having fun, trying
something new and gaining confidence.
Reclusive geniuses coming out of their
shells perhaps, reclusive wankers defi-
nitely not.
For those watching, the show offers
a perfectly decent night out and the
chance to say on a Monday morning, in
answer to the question “What did you
do on your Saturday night?” something
other than “I stayed in and watched
ITV” or “I went to a bar that was trying
a contemporary, nouveau-rustique ter-
rorist bunker-come-brothel theme, but it
only just about managed to muster the
finesse of a cluster bomb.”
Help make Fusion a
success
ically takes a year to organise, involv-
ing a cast of at least 100 students and
a committee of 16-18 students. A show
that has managed to become renowned
for being an outstanding event with a
high professional standard and whose
“Get off! I don’t date men from the 19th century...”
Take Me Out has become quite fancy of late
3... 2... 1... cramp!
