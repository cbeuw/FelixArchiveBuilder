to capitalise on their early man-up plays
but took the lead as Imperial were slow
to start. The reply was quick in com-
ing however and the inevitable nerves
seemed to settle afterwards. The first
quarter was fairly even and the teams
reached the end of the first quarter level.
The start of the second quarter saw a
multitude of penalties from both sides
but unfortunately more from Imperial.
This resulted in Leeds dominating pos-
session for the remainder of the quarter
and they scored a number of goals in
quick succession. Imperial were strug-
gling to regain the ball and went into
half time significantly behind.
Following the ten minute break Im-
perial came back out fighting, forcing
Leeds into making mistakes and this
quarter it was to be them who spent
more time in the penalty box. Impe-
rial managed to get some goals back
through Captain Jeremy Webb and the
formidable crease man Tomas Bym
who would eventually finish top scorer.
Leeds were not helping themselves by
arguing with each other and the refer-
ees, and even though Imperial’s defence
was down to just four men at one point
they held strong and went into the last
quarter just one goal behind.
After the restart both teams were
clearly tiring resulting in sloppy mis-
takes and the play became end-to-end.
The teams were alternating scoring until
Imperial’s Ian Hunt scored three beau-
tiful goals; one brushing the post and
bar on its way into the top corner. This
gave Imperial the lead going into the fi-
nal five minutes but when they should
have held possession they pushed for
the killer goal which resulted in a turn-
over of possession to Leeds who lev-
elled the game again. Imperial pushed
for the winner in the dying minutes but
a number of dropped passes let Leeds
score their 11th and 12th goals and time
eventually ran out for Imperial with the
match finishing 12-10 to Leeds.
It was Imperial’s best performance
against the strongest opposition they
had faced in the three short years the
Men’s team has existed, but it was
Leeds’ ability to hold the ball when a
man down and their efficiency in con-
verting when a man up that was the dif-
ference between the sides in the end.
Although disappointed in letting the
game slip away at the end, Imperial
should look back and be proud at what
they have achieved in such a short time,
and think about how far they have come
since the 20-0 defeat to Birmingham in
their first season.

Lacrosse
bested by
Leeds in
final
On Friday the 18th of March Imperial
College judo sent their elite squad of
Judoka to fight in the British University
Championships. On the journey up to
Sheffield there were many hungry and
thirsty players in the minibus, hoping
to make their weight for the upcoming
weekend. Thankfully, everyone made it
and could relax after a long slog up the
country and a rather large meal.
The tournament kicked on Saturday
with the Individual’s Event, Imperial
entered 4 Dan grades (black and brown
belts) and six Kyu grades (green and
blue belts). Despite the stiff competi-
tion, Tomasz Zamacinski (Kyu -81kg)
fought incredibly well to bring home
a gold medal winning a total of six
fights. Alice Mitchell (Kyu -57kg) and
Jake Woods (Kyu -66kg) also did well
in their categories both earning Bronze
medals. In the Kyu grades, missing out
on the medals, were Adam Elwood,
James Gutsell (both -81kg) and Phillip
Rudden (-66kg). The Dan grades had an
even tougher day but Marie de Parseval
(-63kg) pulled out all the stops and beat
off some of the country’s best female
fighters to achieve a bronze medal. Mat-
thew Scales (-66kg), Bronwyn Dawson
(-57kg) and Eduoard Desclaux (-73kg)
all fought courageously but missed out
on medals in the huge Dan grade pools.
Testaments to the quality of university
judo were several international compet-
itors in the Dan grade categories. Ed lost
out on the Bronze medal to a Latvian in-
ternational after winning five of his six
previous fights.
The following day the team com-
petitions ensued. Karl Brune (-90kg)
and Silvère Lucquin (-73kg) joined
the men’s team along with Ed, Matt
and Tom. The team fought well in the
pool, comfortably beating Manchester,
Nottingham and Strathclyde and only
losing to the gold medal winning An-
glia Ruskin. Unluckily, we were draw
against Plymouth, eventual bronze med-
allists, in the first knockout round and
lost a close set of fights. Imperial were
boosted later, however, with the success
of the women’s team. Alice, Bronwyn
and Marie convincingly beat Cambridge
and Glasgow to secure a Bronze medal.
This was an excellent performance con-
sidering Bronwyn’s shoulder injury and
the other teams mainly consisting of
Dan grades. They were unfortunately
beaten at the semi final by some big la-
dies from Bath.
Throughout the weekend we had great
support and guidance from the club
coach Smudge and a big Irish fellow,
Derek. With their guidance from the
sidelines the great performances were
made possible. A special congratula-
tion is in order to Jake for winning his
bet, forcing Smudge to wear the Sport
Imperial Lion costume throughout Sun-
day. The weekend was topped off with a
relaxed regional competition, where we
banded together with Judoka from ULU
and Middlesex as the London Team. We
beat the North and South West, only los-
ing out to Scotland to achieve a silver
medal.
After much revelry and eating the
Judo squad headed back to London bat-
tered and bruised but with pride intact.
A great effort was made by everyone
who fought and some great results, de-
spite the team being plagued with in-
jury. Imperial Judo is looking strong as
ever, training starts now for BUCS next
year!
BUCS success for
Imperial Judo yet
again
