Further details
emerge on
Mech Eng
refurbishment
New information about the delayed
refurbishment of the Mechanical Engi-
neering department has come to light in
the past week; showing the effect of the
disruption on PhD students and imply-
ing that the College was unhappy with
the way the project was being managed
and that the error with the £3 million
exhaust system is just one area where
the refurbishment has not proceeded
smoothly.
In an extreme case, Felix has been
told that due to the disruption from the
refurbishment one PhD student is yet to
start his experiment, three years after
beginning his PhD. The student was not
willing to speak to Felix about his situ-
ation as he is currently applying for an
extension to his PhD. Several research
groups have been hamstrung by the de-
lays, mostly from the uncertainty over
the completion date and from difficul-
ties in providing temporary facilities for
research. Currently around 12 PhD stu-
dents in the thermal fluids division have
to share a lab where only one student at
a time can carry out their combustion
experiments, due to insufficient ventila-
tion.
The refurbishment of the Mechani-
cal Engineering building began as part
of a wider £277m South-East Quadrant
(SEQ) project that envisaged a new
modern building that would bring Me-
chanical, Aeronautical, and Civil Engi-
neering together under one roof where
the Mechanical Engineering building
currently sits. It was first mooted in
2007 and included plans for a Business
Kadhim Shubber School-esque façade facing onto Exhi-
bition Road. The project, which it was
said would ‘make a statement about En-
gineering at Imperial’, was eventually
shelved at the beginning of 2010 when
Westminster Council rejected the Col-
lege’s planning application, demanding
changes to the design, and the College
decided that the funds required to com-
plete the project would be difficult to
raise after the recession.
However, Phase One of the proj-
ect, involving the refurbishment of
the Skempton Building as well as the
ongoing Mech Eng refurbishment had
already received planning permission
and funding from the College and both
were well underway. Reports from Im-
perial’s former Chief Operating Officer
Dr Martin Knight seemed to indicate
that the refurbishment was continuing
smoothly until May 2010, when he re-
ported to College Council that the Mech
Eng refurbishment was “now under the
management of a different Arup project
manager [...] and is under tight con-
trol”. The minutes record that he also
said “An interim agreement has been
drawn up to settle all current claims
and variations”. The statements suggest
that problems with the refurbishment
were encountered as far back as spring
last year and that the College were
unhappy with Arup’s performance as
project manager. The College declined
to answer questions about the nature
or scale of the problems referred to by
Dr Martin Knight. Arup also declined
to comment on this matter, suggest-
ing that Felix ask the College. Neither
