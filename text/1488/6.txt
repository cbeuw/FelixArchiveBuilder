For many, this decision is long over-
due. Running a space agency is a very
expensive business and hardly sits well
with the libertarian zeitgeist which cur-
rently pervades the US. According to
the Obama administration, we can all
look forward to a future where competi-
tion between private companies drives
the exploration of space relentlessly
onward. However, for others this vision
isn’t so rosy. Some fear that the private
companies simply aren’t yet ready to fill
the huge void left behind by NASA’s
shuttle programme, while others are
ideologically opposed and see the shut-
tle fleet’s retirement as an abandonment
of our enlightenment principles.
The Space Shuttle Endeavour’s final
flight will see the shuttle crew complete
four space walks and deliver a micro-
meteoroid debris shield to the Interna-
tional Space Station. The Endeavour
mission will also deliver a new particle
physics module, the brainchild of No-
bel laureate Samuel Ting, which is set
to measure cosmic rays and search for
evidence of both dark matter and anti-
matter. The International Space Station
is planned to remain in orbit until at
least 2020, with astronauts being ferried
to and from the station exclusively by
Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
The decision to retire the shuttle
fleet was made back in 2004, in the
wake of the Columbia Shuttle disaster.
At the time this decision was made, it
was accompanied by an announcement
from President George W. Bush, out-
lining plans to send astronauts back to
the Moon potentially as early as 2015.
However, these plans have since fallen
by the wayside.
Under Bush, NASA’s Constellation
programme had started development of
a series of rockets, with the potential to
take astronauts much further into space
than the shuttles are currently capable
of doing. This development culminated
in the successful test flight of the Ares-I
prototype in late 2009. However, only
three months later, President Barack
Obama decided to cancel the Constella-
tion programme entirely.
While Obama’s recent budget request
for 2012 does include a small amount
of funding for developing vehicles for
long-distance manned spaceflight, its
real focus is on developing the commer-
cial space sector. The belief in the US
seems to be that ferrying astronauts to
the International Space Station, as well
as other low-orbit activities, should be
left to private companies, thus leaving
NASA to concentrate its resources on
research in other areas.
Obama has recently said that the U.S.
hopes to send astronauts to Mars by
the fourth decade of this century. So,
perhaps NASA’s decision to farm out
some of its activities to private com-
panies wouldn’t actually be such bad
news , if tangible progress were in fact
being made towards achieving this goal.
However, since the scrapping of the
Constellation programme, the global fi-
nancial crisis has really taken hold and
there are currently huge question marks
surrounding the future of manned space
exploration, despite the Washington
rhetoric.
Also, as far as low-orbit manned mis-
sions are concerned, not everyone is
convinced that private companies are
ready to fill the gap left by the shuttle
fleet’s retirement. There is concern that
it is a few years too early to be handing
over responsibility to private companies
while other more outspoken critics, in-
cluding a number of former NASA as-
tronauts, fundamentally disagree with
the idea of handing over responsibility
to private companies at all.
Earlier this month, NASA celebrated
the 50th anniversary of its launching
of the first American into space. On
5th May, 1961, Alan Shepard became
the second man in space, just less than
a month after Yuri Gagarin’s inaugural
spaceflight. Upon Shepard’s return to
Earth, he was asked by a journalist what
had been going through his mind as he
sat atop the Redstone-Mercury rocket
which was to propel him into space.
Shepard reportedly replied: “I was
thinking about the fact that every part
of this ship was built by the low bidder”.
In many ways, Shepard’s laconic re-
sponse sums up the fundamental prob-
lems with relying on private companies
for low-orbit manned space missions.
Making a market out of low-orbit space-
flight may result in reduced costs, but
this should not be sole the factor taken
into consideration. There is also the as-
tronauts’ safety, as well as the safety of

ANDREW PURCELL WAVES GOODBYE TO THE SPACE
SHUTTLE AND SAYS HELLO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR
A history of the
space shuttle
Instead of the
shuttle fleet’s
retirement spelling
the end of an era,
perhaps it can
be used to signal
the start of a new
beginning
“
A
fter being delayed for
over two weeks, on the
16th May the Space Shut-
tle Endeavour is set to
blast off into space for the
final time. Following this mission, NASA
plans to send only one more shuttle into
orbit. It will then retire its ageing shuttle
fleet after a total of 135 spaceflights.

1977 NASA begins test flights
of prototype shuttle ‘Enter-
prise’ (yes, it was given this
name because of Star Trek).
1981 Columbia is the first
shuttle to go into space.
1986 The space shuttle Chal-
lenger, with teacher Christa
McAuliffe on board, breaks
apart in the sky over Florida
just 73 seconds after taking
off.
1990 Discovery launches the
Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit. However, when Hubble
returns its first images to
Earth, it is apparent that the
main mirror has been ground
incorrectly.
1993 In the most audacious
mission of the entire shuttle
programme, Endeavour car-
ries a seven-strong crew into
orbit to carry out repairs on
the Hubble telescope.
1994 Discovery is the first
shuttle to carry a Russian cos-
monaut into space, marking
a new era of cooperation be-
tween the two superpowers.
1998 Endeavour flies the first
US mission to the Internation-
al Space Station.
2003 Columbia disintegrates
during re-entry into the Earth’s
atmosphere, killing all seven
crew members onboard. 2011
Later this summer, Atlantis
will fly NASA’s last ever shuttle
mission, marking the end of an
era in space- flight.
