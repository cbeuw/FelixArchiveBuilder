Imperial NHS Healthcare Trust criticised
for poor cancer care by Macmillan
Trust says that they have learnt lessons since cancer care survey
Trust faces a budget shortfall of ¬£40m
next year.
Patients who were surveyed rated the
Trust poorly in particular for the sup-
port they received while being treated,
how much information they were given
on their disease as well as the number
of medics on duty and said they had
little confidence in staff.
The league table assessed criteria
such as the number of nurses on duty,
the amount of support given to patients
after leaving hospital and financial in-
formation given. It does not cover the
medical treatments received, such as
standards of chemotherapy or surgery.
The Chief Executive of Macmillan
Cancer Support, Ciar√°n Devane, issued
a statement saying, ‚ÄúCancer patients
are being let down by many Trusts that
are failing to give adequate levels of
care. The experiences you have whilst
in hospital can have a massive impact
on your health and wellbeing and how
well you cope once you leave hospital.
We hope that the Trusts given a red
card will work with community ser-
vices and take urgent action to improve
the care they offer cancer patients.‚Äù
The Trust have said that improve-
ments have been made since the pe-
riod when the survey was taken. A
spokesperson acknowledged that some
of their cancer care at the time of the
survey ‚Äúwas below the standard we
strive to deliver‚Äù. However, they said
the Trust had listened to patient feed-
back and a number of improvement
programmes have been implemented,
including improving the provision of
information for patients and investing
in a new chemotherapy suite and young

It has further emerged in the past
week the Trust plans to cut ‚Äòpay ex-
penditure by ¬£44m, or 8%, and cut
150 posts this year‚Äô. The investigation
by the Nursing Times shows the pres-
sure of government cuts on hospital
budgets. A Trust spokeperson said:
‚ÄúWe intend to achieve these savings
by first reducing our substantial bank
and agency numbers and by natural
turnover and redeployment of staff into
areas of growth.
‚ÄúAs outlined in our annual plan, we
expect to selectively reduce substan-
tive staff numbers by around 150 over
the year.‚Äù
...Continued from Front Page The latest report by the Care Qual-
ity Commission, the government‚Äôs in-
dependent healthcare watchdog, found
their patient experience quality to be
‚Äòslightly less than the national aver-
age‚Äô. However, The Trust were rated
highly in meeting cancer waiting time
targets and preventing and controlling
hospital acquired infections, as well as
being well above the national average
in ensuring that no cancer patients wait
longer than one month from diagnosis
of cancer to the beginning of treatment.
Macmillan have said that they will
work with hospitals that performed
poorly in their league to help them im-
prove patient experience.

year as Trust makes
