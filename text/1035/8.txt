The ULU Nippon Kempo team are Currently
World Champions. In March, the Japanese
are coming to the UK with determination to
regain the title.
Nippon Kempo is a relatively modern
combat sport. Unlike most other commonly
known ancient and mystical Japanese martial
arts, Nippon Kempo can boast a history of
only 65 years. Muneumi Sawayama set about
developing a sport the was free of the rituals
and dogma that restricted the traditional arts
to a narrow group of techniques. Nippon
Kempo incorporates all and any technique
that can be effectively, safely and practically
applied in combat, using a full suit of protec-
tive body armour, fashioned around ancient
Samurai armour. The sport is based on scor-
ing points using tact and skill rather than a
knockout, thus avoiding most of the injuries
that commonly occur inmartial arts.
The core of Nippon Kempo is at the
University of London club, which is based at
SOAS (in Russell Square). All the club's
senior members and coaches have been
trained by Physiology and Sports Science
Professor Doya, of Osaka City University
either in Japan or on his training visits to the
UK. In 1992, a UK team consisting of 80%
SOAS club members won the Nippon
Kempo World Championship. This was high-
ly unexpected by the Japanese and they are
currently preparing with vengeance for the
next International Championship due to be
held in Birmingham, March '96. Teams from
Italy, France and America are also expected.
Nippon Kempo is currently expanding to
IC. There exists a unique opportunity for IC
students and staff to be trained by coaches
that have accumulated a wealth of
experience. Those who join the IC
club will automatically have member-
ship of the ULU club. This harbours
the rather intriguing tradition of having
at least one or two U K resident
Japanese who take up Nippon Kempo
from scratch with us. Anyone interest-
ed in Nippon Kempo is welcome. The
00
club atmosphere is friendly and
relaxed and you will be able to train at
your own pace. If you want to become
a champion, then we will get you
there,but if you want to get fit, have
fun and learn how to protect yourself,
j*. you are equally welcome. Most mem-
bers who train regularly are able to
achieve a black belt, first-aid and
coaching qualifications as well as fitness and
confidence by the time they graduate.

Chemistry (0171 594 5807, internal 45807,
