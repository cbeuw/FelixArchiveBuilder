will have the right to stay here
for the same period as your
study. If you need more
advice see the Union Advisor.
Note your spouse can only
work if he/she has a a visa for

All these enquiries are
fictitious- any resemblance to
actual cases or people is
entirely coincidental.
It is possible that you think that
you have never been harassed
& that may be true. However,
you can never assume that
harassment does not effect
you.
So, what is harassment ?
The common feature of
harassment is that it makes a
person feel inferior. It is a form
of offensive behaviour or
language & may include
derogratory remarks, ridicule,
offensive "jokes", & violence.
Some forms of harassment can
be recognised outright. Other
more indirect forms are not so
easy to identify but are just as
damaging to a persons well
being.
Anyone can be harassed.
Harassment is often based on
negative stereotypes & the
most common forms include
sexism, racism, homophobia,
& harassment against people
with disabilities.
If you are being harassed or
have been in the past, there are
a number of ways of dealing
with the issue. Some of the
following suggestions may
help:
*Keep a record of all incidents
This will help if you need to
pursue action, or when
explaining the situation to
others. Make a note of the
time, date, witnesses etc.
*Tell the harasser to stop the
harassment. Explain that you
find it offensive & you may
take further action if it persists.
* Confide in someone who you
can talk to easily. This could be
a close friend, someone in the
Union or College or a counsel-
lor. The Union Adviser will
provide support & deal with
your case in the strictest
confidence. She will have
details of other contacts if
appropriate.
*ICU has a harassment policy,
& deals with cases of
harassment.Support will be
provided & disciplinary action
can be taken against the
harasser. A copy of the policy
is available from the Union
Office.
*In some cases legal action
may be appropriate. Further
information can be obtained
from the Union adviser.
Options include Court orders,
which order the person to stop
the harassment or action,
under the Criminal Justice &
Public Order Act 1994. This
act makes "intentional harass-
ment" a criminal offence.
Legal action can also be taken
regarding physical assault. In
these cases further advice
should be sought immediately
from the Union adviser.
REMEMBER - you do not
have to put up with harass-
ment. Seek advice immediate-
ly from the Union Adviser,
who will listen and discuss
your case with you in the
strictest confidence.
ICU believes harassment is a
serious issue and will always
deal with it as such.
