Sean Lock and John Fothergill represent the
first of five Newcastle Brown Ale National
Corned)' Network acts who are coming to
Imperial College on alternate Fridays this
Autumn.
In the past twelve months Sean Lock
(right) has toured nationally with Mark
LaMarr as well as Newman and Baddiel,
including an appearance at Britain's biggest
ever comedy gig at Wembley Arena in front
of 12,000 people.
Apparently, Sean's distinctive brand of
unique and utterly original comedy,
combining an off-beam style with the sort of
jokes you wouldn't expect outside secure
homes for the irretreivably disturbed, has
established at the very forefront of British
stand-up.
