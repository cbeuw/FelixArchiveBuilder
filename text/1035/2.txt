TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 6TH 1995
Fire Officer:
Alarms are Fine
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
A burning dust sheet, apparently
left by contractors, almost
caused a serious fire in Garden
Hall during September. With the
main entrance to the hall filled
with smoke, a female security
guard managed to put out the
flames using two fire
extinguishers.
Speculation that the fire was
started by a burning cigarette
butt, dropped by one of the hall's
summer residents, is
unconfirmed as the cause
remains a mystery. With at least
one alarm not sounding a
considerable number of residents
did not even attempt to exit the
hall.
Speaking to Felix, Graham
Cox, Imperial College's Fire
Officer, played down the
incident insisting that there was
no real blaze as such. "Dust
sheets do not readily burn ... it's
unlikely that it would have done
anything," he said.
Mr Cox further asserted
that a subwarden had attempted
to extinguish the sheet before
alerting security. The fire, which
occurred in the early hours of 15
September did not result in any
injuries, and following the
activation of the alarms the Hall
was promptly cleared, Mr Cox
Hizb ut Tahrir continued from
page 1
by embracing an Islamic way of
life, especially in Britain, where
they claimed the political system
merely offers "capitalism and
more capitalism".
In response in an incident
where Hizb-ut-Tahrir students
reportedly "sat in" on a meeting
of Kings College London's Jewish
Society, they said that Muslims
should have the right to listen to
other ideologies. They also said
that they were quite prepared to
go on the record and account for
insists.
In view of the over-activity
of the Linstead Fire Alarms, the
Fire Officer stressed that he had
no concern over the system's
reliability. In contrast it has been
suggested to Felix that Security
had no knowledge of the fire
until alerted by a Garden Hall
resident
M r Cox said that the
majority of these alarms were
caused by students tampering
with the system or by
inadvertently exposing detectors
to cooking fumes.
The Fire Officer went on to
indicate that similar systems are
widely used in hotels, "and there
hasn't been a fatality since the
Fire Precautions Act". He
attributed the excess of alarms in
the halls of residences to the
positioning and relatively high
number of kitchen facilities in
student buildings.
The contractors, to whom
the burning dust sheets
belonged, have now finished
their work in Garden Hall.
Mr Cox said though that in
future such items would have to
be locked away when not in use
to reduce any fire risk, though
why regulations to such effect
did not previously exit remains
unclear.
some of their negative publicity,
also claiming that their campaign
was being stifled by student
unions like that of Imperial
College.
In spite of their apparently
mild publicity, Hizb-ut-Tahrir
are well known for their
extremist views. The Deputy
President for Clubs & Societies,
Tim Townend, told Felix that
"they're a recognised terrorist
organisation, banned from Arab
states... [and] banned from most
universities." He added that last
year it was believed that they
were active in about 50
Beit Moves
After the months of confusion,
Imperial Estates are openly
discussing their plans to move
Imperial College Union over to
the Sherfield building. Sarah
White, I C U president, has been
given a copy of the final
feasibility study undertaken by
architects Trout and MacAslan in
preparation for a meeting with
Director of Estates Ian Caldwell
next week. "I am delighted we
are making some progress,"
Sarah said, although she is still
concerned about the lack of
student representation on the
crucial Building Committee.
Andy Mourned
Andrew Flanagan, who was I C U
Bars Manager between 1991 and
1993, died of AIDS this week.
There will be a service at
Golders Green Crematorium at
3pm this afternoon.
C&S Break-in
It is still not known just how
much has been lost in the theft
from the clubs and societies
store room last month. The store
on the top floor of the union
building was broken into at some
stage over the summer, but it is
not known exactly when. The
damage was only discovered
when last year's I C U President
Lucy Chothia went back to
reclaim some things she had left
in the room over the summer.
universities, but were strongest in
London. "They are really bad,"he
added, citing newspaper reports
of their anti-semitic, anti-
democracy, extremist views and
their support of anti-Israeli
terrorist action. If they appeared
on campus again, he said, they
would have to removed for
trespassing, as happened on
Tuesday, though he conceded
that it was problematic for other
college issues such as freedom of
speech.
Imperial College Union
President Sarah White said that
similar activity had taken place at
While Lucy had not left anything
particularly valuable in the store,
she has lost a number of things of
sentimental value, including her
old rowing medals. As a number
of different people have access to
keys to the store, it seems
unlikely that I C U will be able to
find the culprit.
Freshers' Full Up
The I C U Freshers' events have
sold out every night this week,
and there are no tickets left for
tonight's carnival. Entertain-
ments Manager Mark Home
insists that students without
tickets should not turn up at the
event, as they will not be able to
get in. He says he is 'delighted'
with the success of the events.
There have been a number
of problems during the week: on
Monday evening, the building
had to be evacuated when the
fire alarms went off. Badly
functioning vents meant that gas
from the smoke machine
accumulated at the top of the
building. On Wednesday even-
ing, a window was broken in the
Union lounge. It is not known
who was responsible.
Erratum
In Felix 1034 we mistakenly
described the attempted suicide
as being from the Mechanical
Engineering department. He was
in fact from the department of
Electrical Engineering.
the freshers' fair at University
College London, and that there
had even been a bomb scare. One
source at U C L S U said the group
had "been very disruptive and
intimidating, and were harassing
students" and had been ignoring
pleas for them to stop. They were
consequently banned from the
Freshers' Fair but proceeded to
take over the stalls of the Arab
and Pakistani Societies. In the
light of these events, Sarah said
that there were now plans for a
ULU-wide telephone support
service should such activity occur
again.
