So Sylvester Stallone returns in another film made Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, but
involving guns, murder and redemption. unsurprisingly it lacks both films' humour.

Assassins possesses that easy going
action that will delight testosterone/
adrenaline addicts. The action sequences
are extremely Hong Kong in style i.e.
loads of bullets, sparks, explosions and
that 'gun in each hand' syndrome. It was
