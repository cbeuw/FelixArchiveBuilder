STUDENT HARDSHIP RISING
It is evident from the number
of students using the Union
Advice service that student
financial hardship is continu-
ing to increase . There are
many examples of students
working long hours for low
wages and others who have
not eaten for several days in
order to pay essential bills
such as rent and fuel bills.
The budget at the end of
1994 was not good news for
students. Gillian Shepherd,
Secretary of State for
Education, revealed that insti-
tutions will have to make an
almost 3.5% financial cut on
each person as student
numbers rise. The rates for
grants will be reduced by 8%
which will result in more
students having to rely on
loans.
Mature students will be badly
affected by the abolishment
of the allowance received by
students over twenty six. A l l
in all, funding for higher
education is to be cut by £25
million in each of the next
two academic years and will
continue at the new reduced
figure into 1997/8. To make
matters worse students are
facing long delays in having
their applications processed
for a student loan .
While looking at the financial
problems faced by home
students, wc should
remember that international
students outside the E E C do
not receive Local Education
Authority grants and cannot
apply for student loans.
There are discussions taking
place which consider ways in
which students can pay for
their education. Recent sug-
gestions include the idea of
students repaying mainte-
nance and possiibly fee costs
through national insurance
and tax. This added burden
would be very worrying
when most students already
face having to repay student
loans and large debts when
they leave college. It is
thought that 18 to 21 year old
students are accumulating
debts over £2,000 and it is
possible that older students
may run debts up to £6,000. It
is possible that the growing
financial pressures may dis-
courage people from poorer
backgrounds from embarking
on higher education courses
in the future.
It can be said that student
poverty exists now and
measures which may worsen
the situation should be strong-
ly opposed. H o w can stu-
dents who have to worry
about meeting their basic
finances be expected to cope
with the pressure of their
studies?
It may be possible for institu-
tions to introduce schemes to
assist students in financial
difficulty such as providing
c h e a p e r
a c c o m m o d a t i o n , c h e a p e r
meals,help with books and
cheaper nursery places. Some
colleges have set up systems
to waive or reduce fees in
cases of extreme hardship.
Current provisions such as the
access and hardship trust have
helped many students to cope
with the pressures that finan-
cial hardship brings.
The start of a new academic
year can surely be the most
stressful time of the year for
many students. This article is
intended to highlight some of
the financial problems which
can increase the pressure on
students.
If you are experiencing
financial difficulties, seek
advice from the Union
Adviser.
Is Your Gas A
Killer?
Carbon monoxide poisoning
from faulty gas heaters
poses a real threat to us all.
Approximately 30 or 40
deaths occur in this way
every year and students are
often the victims.
Carbon monoxide is diffi-
cult to detect as it cannot be
seen and does not necessari-
ly smell.There arc, however,
a few danger signs to look-
out for, such as stains at the
top of a gas heater or a yel-
low/orange flame.
But the best way of ensuring
your appliance is safe, is to
have it checked by a quali-
fied person ( C O . R . G . I .
R E G I S T E R E D ) .
The good news is that from
31st October 1994, land-
lords/ladies have a legal
responsibility to ensure that
gas appliances are checked
every 12 months. They have
to keep an inspection record
which must be made avail-
able to students. A gas safe-
ty action line has been set up
to provide information.
They can be contacted by-
phoning (freephone) 0800
300 363.
A l l in all, these changes may
help students to protect
themselves against unneces-
sarv death.
