Hizb-ut-Tahrir Move into Imperial
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
Police were called to an incident
on Prince Consort Road on
Tuesday after confrontations
between the Islamic Liberation
Party and the organisers of the
Freshers' Fair. A group of
students representing Hizb-ut-
Tahrir were involved in
unauthorised activities just
outside Beit Quad.
While the officially
recognised Imperial College
Islamic Society had a legal stand
in the Sherfield Ante Room,
certain members of an
internationally renowned radical
grouping decided that this was
not sufficiently prominent.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir feel that
both their organisation and
Islam in general, have been
subjected to a media smear
campaign portraying them as
evil extremists. Distributing
leaflets from a stand outside
Beit Arch on Prince Consort
Road, entitled "Discovering
Islam", they claim that the
"western secular way of life is
not working".
However, one of the
organisers claimed that they
were not proponents of an
Islamic state as such, but were
merely "raising awareness."
According to sources at I C U ,
the group's aggressive style
warranted concern among
Union Stewards who asked
them to relocate.
When this failed, College
security called the Police, who
watched from outside the newly
refurbished Aeronautics Chem-
ical Engineering entrance.
Shortly afterwards they asked
the group to move slightly to
one side as they were blocking
the main Union entrance.
However the Hizb-ut-Tahrir
campaigners complied with this
request.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir came to
prominence in October 1994
after allegedly distributing anti-
semitic and homophobic
literature at the University
London Union, and IC's own
Islamic Society distanced itself
from the group, as have many
mainstream Muslims.
A thirty-year-old inter-
national organisation, Hizb-ut-
Tahrir feel that western
problems such as poverty and
unemployment could be solved

The annual Freshers' Flea Market - another creative name for
freshers' fair - took place on Tuesday afternoon. While committee
members of clubs and societies tried to get as many members as
possible, freshers and non-freshers received more and more leaflets.
Students readily solved the problem of excessive pamphlets by
getting rid of them in the nearest bin.
Almost 200 clubs, societies and businesses braved the rain to
display their wares around the Queen's Lawn, Sherfield building
and throughout I C U .
"I think it was a great success," said Tim Townend, Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies).
Drinking to Excess
I C U staff angrily denounced an
article in last week's Time Out
which suggested that Imperial
students have a problem with
drinking to excess.

Fire in Garden Hall
Graham Cox, IC Fire Officer,
has denied there is any problem
with the fire alarm system in the
light of a fire in Garden Hall last
month.
