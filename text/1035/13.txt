book: lost inmusic- giles smith,
"Caught in a trap, no turning back, we're lost in
music" - that's how the song goes and the
sentiments seem entirely appropriate. After
football, Nick Hornby and his gang of literary
newlads (Giles Smith included) have turned
their home counties' glance toward music. The
result; books to cater lor every Q readers'
Christmas list.
Which is not to say that Smith's Lost In
Music, in particular, is a bad book by any means.
It's clever, occasionally funny and all shot
through with the sort of parochial under-
statement which made England little. And
Smith has a tale to tell, recounting his trials in the
music industry as he fumbles from one poorly
named group to the next. But overall what's
significant is the numbing mixture of
superficiality and obsessional detail, without
normality in between. Cross a music
encyclopedia and the discos you had at primary
school and you're getting close.
The only point of connection with actual life
seems to be the chapter when Giles' father dies.
At the funeral there were, "no pop songs,
obviously. Because my father didn't like pop
songs. And because there isn't a pop song written
that could have been played there".

exhibition: africa - royal academy*
Where do you start? would seem to be the obvious
question to ask on entering the Royal Academy's
new exhibition : Africa - the art of a continent'.
Even with the ability to display over eight hundred
works, the RA have had some hard decisions to
make on what exactly to show in their
embracingly titled show. Rightly or wrongly they
have decided on objects rather than what we in
the West would usually consider to be Art'. In
practice this means that the exhibition in the main
consists offigurettes,masks and statues with the
odd sprinkling of jewellry and textiles.
It's an approach which makes sense
particularly as the exhibition is laid out in such a
way as to show the development from purely
functional items, such as axe heads, to the purely
symbolic as most gloriously seen in the golden
idols of the Egyptians. On the other hand it does
leave the RV looking a little like the Museum of
Mankind at times and you do wonder whether
the curator could have included some paintings as
well.
That said, there's still enough on display to
keep you occupied. The enormous scope of the
exhibits (ranging in both time and geography) almost by necessity throws up some interesting
thoughts. Some of the figures could be exhibited
as modem abstracts, such has been the full circle
experienced in that form of representation. More
obviously there are the facial styles that Modigliani
plundered, and indeed if anything is
representative of the entire exhibition it is the
multiplicity of human faces and masks which are
displayed.
Very few of them are realistic. Reflecting
their use in ritualistic and religious ceremonies
they show the whole gambit of human emotions,
from grinning clowns to eerie witch-doctor
howlefs. There are also examples of Coptic
Christian and Islamic art which also shed new
light on the traditional examples that we are more
familiar with. The Coptic crucifixions are
particularly good in this respect.
Overall however, the exhibition does suffer
from being no more than the sum of its parts.
There's no strand totiethe whole thing together,
like the continent it's something of an enigma.
