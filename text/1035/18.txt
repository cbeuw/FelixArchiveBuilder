Fire in the
House!
How long ago is it now that the
new fire alarm system first start-
ed causing problems? I know that
Felix has been reporting on
excessive alarm ringing now for
over a year.
So why is it then that the
system still causes us - both stu-
dents and staff - so many prob-
lems. Last Monday night is but
one example in a continuing, and
seemingly unending line of false
alarms for this 'sophisticated sys-
tem'.
With a leak in a ventilation
pipe and a exhaust duct that was
restricted the alarms on the third
floor of the Union went off. This
wasn't the most notable part of
the evening, it was the requisite
clearing of the building half an
hour before the advertised clos-
ing time that caused the prob-
lems.
How do you explain to a
group of not fully sober revellers
that the alarm has not actually
been activated on purpose so
that the staff can go home early?
Well by all accounts this is not
something readily explainable to
the average punter!
This time the cause was
something which can be fixed,
but what about the continuous
excuses of student cooking and
people spending too long in the
shower. How long is it before it
is realised that students are not
likely to change their culinary
habits just so that a 'high tech'
fire alarm system can be
installed.
The authorities are not
aware of the level of sceptisism
that the average student has
when they hear an alarm these
days. What is the point of getting
out of bed in the middle of the
night when you know its not
going to be for real anyway?
A case in point is the
Garden Hall 'incident' which
occurred over the Summer. Just
how many people actually both-
ered to get up and out of the
Hall whilst the alarms sounded.
Having spoken to quite a few of
the residents, the answer is - not
a lot.
And who can blame them
with this constant stream of false
alarms which can hardly be kept
a secret in a college this size. So
the onus then focus on the main-
tainers and installers of the
alarms to respond with a system
that is suitable to student halls.
While College does have to
have to conform to stringent reg-
ulations during Vacation time so
that they can operate halls as
hotels, these are not required for
term time residency. What will
happen when there actually is a
fire and a student dies because
they didn't bother leaving hall
for the third time that week?
Will College then realise that
they were putting student lives
in danger all along - or will they
still reject all accusations of neg-
ligence and continue to blame it
on the students?
