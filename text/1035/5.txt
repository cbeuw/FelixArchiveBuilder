GRADUATES
With a p i o n e e r i n g history that has brought
motor transport w i t h i n the reach of so many
people, and a sales network that n o w circles
the globe, it is impossible to overestimate the
impact that Ford has had on the w o r l d .
O u r c o n t i n u e d success depends o n many
factors - not least of w h i c h is an intelligent,
reasoned and logical approach to business.
But it takes more than logic alone to make
real progress and that is one of the reasons
why we can offer such a unique and
stimulating opportunity to graduates. In the
motor industry, we are facing a time of greater
change than ever before, and to meet this
challenge we rely o n fresh ideas from people
with imagination.
