Conservative perspective
Editor:
In response to your report of last
week on our web pages, I am
amazed that a newspaper such as
yours which pretends to defend
free speech by attacking any
questions about Rupert Murd-
och's financial interests can be
running such a voracious
campaign against our own on-line
magazine. Perhaps the
contradiction can be easily
explained by stating the obvious:
you disagree with us.
Nothing in our web pages
could cause Rupert Murdoch to
take legal action against us since
we are protected by several
education acts. The article was
credited to me personally and is
not official ConSoc policy (what
do you think "Off the Record"
means?) Your implicit defence of
Murdoch, coming from a
"politically neutral" paper wasn't
signed however. Can we take it
that this is official Felix policy?
Your hysteria over my
political views shows that Felix is
no place for rationally discussing
the issues of the day - hence the
need for our society.
The majority of people in
this country are uninterested in
politics and there is tremendous
scope for people such as
Murdoch to use tabloid
sensationalism to influence the
views of his wide readership by
relying on the fact that they
won't be bothered to assess his
newspapers' articles for bias or
factual content.
Similarly a lot of people at
IC have little knowledge or
interest in ConSoc. But many of
them, particularly some
uninitiated freshers may naively
believe that all of your staff are
capable of seriously reporting
events accurately without
melodrama.
Ian Bayley
ConSoc Chairman
You're spot on: I do disagree
with you, although I don't much
care for Rupert Murdoch either,
quite frankly. And I promise
faithfully to never make
defending multi-national media
tycoons official policy. But what
gave you the idea that Felix was
'politically neutral'?
I trust that you feel you
have satisfactorily redressed the
balance for all those naive
freshers.
Deadline for
letters:
6pm
Monday.
Please bring
your union
card for
identification.
