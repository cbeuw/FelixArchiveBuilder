COUNCIL TAX ,
STUDENTS AND
SPOUSES.
If a property (dwelling) is
occupied solely by full-time
students, that property is
exempt from the council tax.
This means that you do not
have to pay council tax if
everyone you share the prop-
erty with is also a full-time
student.
Until 1st April 1995, students
who shared the property with
their non-British spouse were
liable to pay 75% of the
council tax bill if the spouse
was not a full time student.
This has now changed. A
non-British spouse (or
dependent) who is forbidden
to work in the UK or claim
public funds and who lives
with a full-time student is
exempt from paying the
council tax.
This amendment will be of
particular use to international
students who have faced
great difficulty paying the
council tax when they were
joined by their family,
especially as council tax
benefit was included in the
forbidden 'recourse to public
funds' rule.
Students needing further
advice or experiencing
problems should consult
the Adviser or UKCOSA.
Television Licences
If you use a television, you
need a licence. You can
purchase a licence from the
post office. The cost of a
colour television licence from
1st April 1995 is £86.50 and
the cost of a black and white
television licence is now
£28.50.
You need a colour licence if
you have a black and white
television connected to a
video recorder.
It is a criminal offence to
watch a television without a
licence and if found guilty,
face a fine.
The bad news
N.H.S charges increased in
April. Prescription charges
for medication will increase
from £4.75 to £5.25 per item.
The good news
Students may be entitled to
help with N.H.S. charges.
This will help to pay for
N.H.S. prescriptions, N.H.S
dental treatment, glasses and
sight tests, N.H.S. wigs and
fabric supports and travel to
hospital for N.H.S. treatment.
Driving
Licences
UKCOSA, an advisory
organisation for international
students have suggested that
international students obtain a
UK licence if they plan to
remain in Britain for longer
than twelve months to avoid
serious legal problems.
This may involve having to
take a UK driving test
depending on which national
licence is held.
Further information can be
obtained from DVLA,
Swansea, SA6 7JL.
Details are available from the
Union Reception area.
International students can
also claim help with N.H.S.
charges without any effect on
immigration status as it does
not constitute 'recourse to
public funds'.
You can claim help with
N.H.S. charges by completing
form AG1. The form is
available from the Union
reception area, health centres
and social security offices.
This first Advice Newsletter was bought to you by ICU Advice office and is just one of the services
