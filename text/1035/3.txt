Reports
IC Drink Problem Denied
Alcohol Awareness Campaign Planned
Returning students enjoyed the start of the new term at the Freshers' events this week.
BY ALEX FEAKS
College authorities reacted
strongly to suggestions
published this week in London's
listing magazine, Time Out, that
Imperial College has a problem
with student drinking. The
article said that there was
"excessive drinking on campus"
at Imperial.
Alan Swanson, Pro-Rector
(Educational Quality) thought
the report to be inaccurate,
highlighting what, in reality,
effects only a small number of
students. "Our best estimate is
that the average spent per
student per annum on drink is
only about Â£100."
Even allowing for the
students at Imperial who spend
little or no money in college
bars, this figure implies that
there is only a core of a few
people who are drinking a lot.
Sarah White, ICU
President, was "annoyed that
the article created a negative
image of the College," and
insisted that IC was "no worse
than anywhere else". ICU has
recently begun to enforce a
policy of not allowing those
obviously drunk onto their
licensed premises, and last year
the C C U Presidents signed a
document stating alcohol
consumption at their events is
not obligatory. These moves are
part of co-ordinated attempt to
de-institutionalise excessive
student drinking and the
behaviour it can encourage.
Most excessive and rowdy
drinking is annoying for other
bar users and an unpleasant
morning after for the
participants PC Clive Coleman,
whose beat includes the
campus, said that incidents for
which he is called out to college
for are often drink related.
These are most commonly
neighbours complaining about
the noise, although there have
been more serious
offencesincluding a number of
assaults on Union stewards in
the past year.
A rise in the number of
reported drink related incidents
over the last few years
causedthe College to
establishing a policy on drinking
for both students and staff. For
example, College Catering have
been instructed to not hold
lunchtime promotions to bring
them into line with the Union.
A House Committee met in
June to discuss the issue and
informal talks with Union
representatives over the
summer agreed on increasing
awareness of drink related
problems, including holding an
'Awareness Week' sometime
this term.
PC Coleman joined with
the Union and College auth-
orities in endorsing a new
initiative on campus - Bar Watch
- following the 'barred from one,
barred from all' principle. Union
staff have, however, been
reluctant to set up any kind of
'rogue's gallery' of offenders,
saying that it create a 'Big
Brother' image that they would
rather avoid.
Dear Readers,
Welcome to Imperial
College. I am the local
community officer for the area.
My involvement at the college is
to report crimes, give student
talks, organise crime prevention
displays and code pedal cycles.
I will assist in any personal
or police matters. My advice to

large sums of money around the
street.
Please do not leave
property unattended in College,
