" O u r finest h o u r "
from our correspondent in Southside.
J O Y O U S S C E N E S of dancing
announcement that the outbreak
has ravaged this v i c i n i t y over
The official announcement
followed persistent rumours
emanating from several sources
indicating that the epidemic was
in its final stages of dying out.
For the heroic and gallant
band of survivors, this means
that long weeks of suffering are
ended as Southside is again
declared fit for human habitation
No more s c e n e s o f a s i n i n e ' Y o u n g
Pensylvania Symphonic Major-
ettes' prancing up and down in
P r i n c e ' s Gardens with various
oddly shaped black c a s e s . The
in the streets tonight greeted the
of 'Touristus Americanus', w h i c h
the summer months, is now over.
Southside refectory staff w i l l no
longer have to say no to 'Say do
you take pesetas?'
A n official spokesman tonight
declared that the consumption of
c i g a r s , ice-cubes and c o c a - c o l a ' s
were almost back to normal.
T h i s was the night everyone
had been looking forward to as
it became obvious that this e p i -
demic was no mere ' s c a r e ' . From
the first c a s e s of people spend-
ing over £300 a night (including
breakfast) in Southside till today
when the last American left
represents as big a test of the
B r i t i s h and (colonial) spirit as
at anytime in our history. From
now o n , surely this 'was our
finest hour'.

by members of the I.C.
Wives C l u b , welcomes
students to a free B E E R
& B A G E R S nosh-up, at
170 Q u e e n ' s Gate, on
Thursday, 16th October,
1975, from 5.30 - 7 jOOpm.
Names, please, to J e n ,
Union Office, by not
later than Monday, 13th
October.
May we be the last to bid
our Domestic Bursar, C a r l
Seaford, a belated welcome on
his return to the C o l l e g e after
a recent i l l n e s s . Mr Seaford has
clearly lost a great deal of
weight, but has apparently re-
tained his sense of humour as
a recent incident demonstrates:
J e n Hardy-Smith, the Union
C l e r k , enters Mr Seaford's of-
fice to retrieve a pewter tank-
ard from his s a f e .
J e n : "Hello Mr Seaford, I have
come about the pot".
Seaford: (Slapping his once
ample abdomen) "You're too
latem'dear. It's gone!"
After more than a century in
the Huxley B u i l d i n g , the Maths
Department is now resident in
its new b u i l d i n g , W2, after a
removal operation which has
not been without i n c i d e n t .
Who, we wonder, is going to
be brave enough to t e l l Prof
Whitrow of the fate of his treas-
ured antique roll-topdesk, which
fell to Its demise when it was
dropped from the removal van
by persons unknown. It is hoped
that on the o c c a s i o n of the
performance of this duty Prof
Whitrow is in a good mood.
The eminent Prof H had no
sooner entered his new office
than he decided that the notice
board was on the wrong w a l l .
In a flash Prof H resolved the
problem — he pulled the board
from the w a l l , along with a
considerable quantity of p l a s t e r .
We are unable to deny (or
confirm) that Prof H ' s wife was
later overheard speaking to him
in a harsh v o i c e : " Y o u got a
very nice office here, Valter.
Vot you vont to go an' spoil it
for?"
S t i l l in the Maths Dept,
news has reached us of the
(in)famous text, "Mathematical
Methods for Science Students".
The s a i d text has been recently
translated into Portuguese.
Longmans, the publishers, are
however unable to say whether
the text Is widely read by a n t i -
Communists. Dr Stephenson
was not a v a i l a b l e for comment.
A student commenting on Mr
M u l l e y ' s opening speech at the
NUS teacher education confer-
ence s a i d , "When I go back to
my union, I shall say that a
Minister of Education came to
the conference, stood up, closed
his eyes (I didn't think they
had to close them — Ed.) and
said 'I see no cuts' and went
away again".
Charles C l a r k e , NUS pres ident,
speaking at the same confer-
ence s a i d , "NUS is finished if
we do,not unite with the other
educational organisations and
the TUC and campaign on a
broad (Lett - Ed.) basis. NUS
will be at odds with its mem-
bership and fragmentation will
result".
