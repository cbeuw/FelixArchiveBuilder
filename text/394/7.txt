A report on the recently completed summer tour, by the
Sports Editor, Andrew Hall.
from our own correspondent in Southside.
T h i s is a story of alochol
algipan, of cricketing and
chundering and of a dedicated
band of batsmen and boozers
who, when assembled at the end
of last term, comprised the IC
Cricket C l u b Tour Party (1975).
The tour involved 10 matches
in as many days; intensive yet
enjoyable cricket played
against the inhabitants of the
friendly hamlets of the South-
west (at least we hope they are
s t i l l f r i e n d l y ) .
The tour started well when
John England in h i s Volkswagen
crossed the river three times
whi Ist looking for the M3 . He
caught up with the minivan near
Southampton and on arrival at
their ground we were told that
they had " o n l y 6 players at the
moment" and no match b a l l , so
we lent them John Thornback
(Hon Sec) and then l o s t . A
cracking start! (Southampton
University II 199 - 7, J .
T h o r n b a c k 4 6 ; I C 1 0 3 ) .
For the next seven matches
we were based in Torguay in a
rather grim hotel with the
standard number of " P o l i t e
N o t i c e s " .
The second'match against
The long, hot summer is
drawing to a c l o s e , and the
C o l l e g e w i l l soon resound to
the noise of undergraduates.
S o c i a l and sporting a c t i v i t i e s
for the 1600 postgraduates dur-
ing this time has b e e n non-
e x i s t e n t . The P G ' s contribute
up to 40 per cent of the U n i o n ' s
total budget, w h i c h , for the
coming year is about £80,000.
T h i s money has already been
allocated to various sections of
the Union. It is up to every
postgraduate student to try and
get h i s money's worth from the
Union . It is pointless sitting
back and complaining about the
lack of s o c i a l and s p o r t i n g
a c t i v i t i e s suitable for post-
graduates. If you feel strongly
about it, come to a meeting of
the I C P G G or see your depart-
mental P G reps and e x p r e s s
your f e e l i n g s . Postgraduates
have got to come forward and
help organise and participate
actively in these events, other-
w i s e the undergraduates w i l l
continue to enjoy a d i s p r o p -
ortionate amount of the total
budget .
Yelverton Bohemiams ended in
an e x c i t i n g draw in which both
sides could have won (IC 148;
Yelverton Bohemians 147 — 8 ) .
They are in danger of losing
their picturesque pitch to
developers and we wish them
s u c c e s s in their fight.
The next day (after having
left the scorebook at Yelverton)
we were hammered by a n
Exeter team, containing several
minor county players, w h i c h is
top of the Devon League (Exeter
213 - 8; IC 7 8 ) .
We struggled to a draw
against Plymouth C o l l e g e
staff after a batting c o l l a p s e
(Plymouth C o l l e g e 1 6 4 - 8 ; IC
74 — 9 ) . Our s i d e w a s then
fortified by the arrival of R o b
Young and C h r i s Y o r k for the
weekend and we beat Brixham
handsomely on the Saturday
(IC 149, R . Y o u n g 52; Brixham
46 ; N.Treen 5 for 1 8 ) .
A very slow and boring
batting performance only
enlivened by a brisk 42 not out
from John England set the tone
for a draw against Plymstock
however, some more e x c e l l e n t
batting by N i c k " I r o n - m a n "
Treen gave the match a c l o s e
Certain sections of the P G
g rou p ha ve ex pres s e d t h e o p i n i o n
that s i n c e We a s a whole do not
take a n a c t i v e part in the U n i o n ,
there is no need for the grant
awarding body to contribute any
Union dues . T h i s may s a v e the
taxpayer some money, but not
only is it unfair on the 10 t o 2 0
per cent of the P G ' s who do
take an a c t i v e part, it is a
defeatist attitude to w h i c h I
w i l l not s u b s c r i b e .
The C V C P study group has
brought out its report on P G
e d u c a t i o n . One of the consequ-
ences of this i s likely to be a
review of P G education at I C .
T h i s , I feel, is not only e s s e n t i a I
but a l s o long overdue because
the present system is highly
wasteful of resources. Imperial
C o l l e g e has a very good reput-
ation internationally, but I
wonder how much of it is due
to the " s t e r l i n g " research c a r -
ried out h e r e . It is pointless
to blame either the academic
staff or the postgraduate students
for the quality of research, be-
cause the system precludes any
serious work.
The major proportion of the
research is carried out by P G ' s .
In some quarters it has been
stated that PG's are basically
trainee research workers . If that
is the case it is pointless to
expect high quality research
from them. I would further add
that two out of their three years
are a waste of time and money,
since one year is more than
adequate for research training.
I feel a much better system
would be to have a one year
training period, followed by a
two year period under contract
as a research worker. This
would be renewable for further
periods depending on the ability
of the individual student. The
main benefits which will accrue
are that the potentia I of capable
students will be fully utilised
and secondly it will encourage
the staff to adopt a more res-
ponsible attitude.
From the student point of
view, the major advantage is
that you become a fully fledged
salaried research worker. A d -
mittedly this sort of system
would only really work in a
place like IC where most of the
research work carried out is of
a practical nature.
Although in the short term
this will prove to be more ex-
pensive, in the long term it
would be far more beneficial.
I believe that even the 'cost-
effectiveness' maniacs at the
Treasury will adopt a mere
.sympathetic view of this sort of
"system than they do of the ex-
isting one.

128 - 8).
The highlight of the tour was
as usual, the Bannacombe game.
Only a 20 over evening match
played on their amazing bowl-
like pitch; the square is at
least 20 feet below the
boundaries; the ball rolling back
to the batsman from squareleg!
They have a bar extension for
this match until 1.00am (in
fact it stayed open unti I 2 DO aim
and many sliy games were played
involving much alcohol.
Undeniably the highlight of
this evening, for which the
locals look forward to expect-
antly. Is the traditional 3 —man
lift.The unsuspecting victim
was Tom Ghosh, the operation
was co-ordinated by Nick Treen
and the Algipan applied by
rubber-gloved Graham Webb.He
didn't have a chance! The van
was a horrible mess next
morning and John England has
leamt not to chunder downwind
from a fellow regur gitator.
Against South Devon a
typical IC slow start then
collapse, was halted by Graham
Webb (46) and Andrew Hall (48)
who put on a 100 runs in 12
overs of this 35 over match.
South Devon made the runs with
two overs to spare though the
game was marred by an incident
in which the square-leg umpire
called " N o - b a l l " for throwing
against the "Tottenham terror"
Chandra Kulkami when, after a
very quick delivery, he bowled
the batsmen who was on his way
to the pavillion by the time the
call came (!) and so he was
given not out.
When moved to lllminster to
play in a fixture organised by
Nigel Broom (who succumbed to
Ghosh's revenge and fell for the
3-man lift, poor lad) which we
won (IC 116 - 7, G Webb 47;
lllminster 67 — 8; 20 over
match).
The final game against
Yeovil was cancelled when we
arrived at the ground as they
were unable to raise a team.A
great time was had by a l l .
