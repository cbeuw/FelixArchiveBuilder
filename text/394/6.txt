The 9th Fontana Book of Great
Horror Stories:
Edited by Mary Danby.
I A M not a devotee of, the Horror Story
genre myself prefering those distinct
brands of fiction lurking behind the lable
S . F . However the anthology is common in
a l l three forms of literature and in any
anthology there is always at least one
story one l i k e s . In this case it was 'The
Horror at Chilton Castle', w h i c h despite its
rather baroque title was very readable. I
did not find the stories very frightening but
then again I was not reading them by
candlelight in an empty house at midnight.
Some were s o predictable they would need
that treatment. But I must not be too harsh
— after eight volumes good stories must be
getting thin on the ground.
A Glastonbury Romance
John Cooper Powys
THIS IS a great book and has been compar-
ed with "War and P e a c e ' it q u a l i f i e s by
length alone. The novel is ' a mystical
masterpiece ...that recreates the eternal
legend of the Grail'. However, despite
these defects, it remains an interesting
book. Perhaps the description 'erotic'
could a l s o be used s i n c e the p a s s i o n s of a
certain level of society in 1933 are exam-
ined concurrently with the passion of the
g r a i l .
The story is w e l l constructed although a
few of the mystic passages struck me as
rather 'pseudo'.- The depth of characters
are plumbed, predictability is avoided, and
after having adjusted to the s t y l e and pace
of the book I found it quite enthralling.
Nevertheless, the mystic passages provided
for many breaks in the book and consequent
lapses of concentration.
It would be appropriate to end with the
first sentence of the book: 'At the striking
of noon on a certain fifth of March, there
occurred within a casual radius of Brandon
railway station and yet beyond the deepest
pools of emptiness between the uttermost
stellar systems one of those infinitesimal
ripples in the creative silence of the First
Cause which always occur when an excep-
tional stir of heightened consciousness
agitates any living organism in this astro-
nomical universe'. Whew!
Jorge Luis Borges: A Universal
History of Infamy
T h i s is an amazing book. These short
stories were originally written for p u b l i c a -
tion in an Argentinian Newspaper in the
1930's and have only recently been trans-
lated from the original Spanish version.
T h i s task was completed by Norman
Thomas d i G i o v a n n i w h o stayed with Borges
(who has been s l o w l y going blind) in
Buenos A r i e s from 1968 to 1972. Borges
himself describes the style of the stories
as Baroque, 'that style which deliberately
exhausts (or tries to exhaust) all its poss-
ibilities and which borders on its own
parody'...
The book chronicles the lives of certain
famous v i l l a i n s ( B i l l y the K i d and the
Tichbourne daiment are but two). Borges
throws in a hoax or two (something for
which he is apparently now famous) by i n -
venting stories and a s c r i b i n g them to a
previous author (and giving references). I
e s p e c i a l l y liked the set of very short tales
in which human v i l l a i n y gets its just
reward, becoming the v i c t i m of fate, encha-
ntment or its own perversity. The title of
this section of the book is ' E t c e t e r a ' ,
which I thought quite a nice touch. I am
converted and am off to find more of
Borges's books.

IF Y O U have ever had sympathies for
the vegetarian viewpoint, but have been
deterred from taking the plunge by fear of
not being able to get a balanced diet, or
by your image of the " f o o d f a d d i s t " , this
may be a book to change your mind.
Ms Lappe' k i c k s off by giving some
a s t o n i s h i n g s t a t i s t i c s ; like half ot the US
grain harvest, much of w h i c h could be
consumed by human, goes down the
gullets of livestock, w h i c h convert only
one tenth of this back to edible protein.
She tries to d i s p e l the myth that every
meal must contain meat, and introduces
nutritional concepts like amino-acid
balance, e x p l a i n i n g them in laymans
terms. Comprehensive tables are then
given w h i c h allow you to work out which
foods are best combined to y i e l d the
required prote i n .
The last section of the book is a
c o l l e c t i o n of recipes, more of which are
to be found in a follow-up book, "Recipes
for a Small Planet."

assorted saxophes and piano, Tony H i c k s
on drums, and C o l i n Hodgklnson on
v o c a l s , b a s s , and guitar. B a c k Door turn
out some pretty impressive sounds when
their c o l l e c t i v e minds are put to it, as
evidenced by two-thirds of this album,
but a l s o c h u m out lighthearted, dross
imaginations stumbling around, for the
remaining third.
They are three obviously talented
musicians v y i n g for deserved acknow-
ledgement on the music scene with this
their third a l b u m . " B l a k e y Jones" is a
rocking instrumental brimming with
attack and a good awareness of pace
w h i l s t they show their v e r s a t i l i t y on
numbers s u c h a s , " T . B blues" relaxing
back into a soft twelve-bar armchair and
sounding like the early c o l o s s e u m . T h i s
is followed by the jazzed rantings of
"Candles round your hat" and the
beautifully moving, melancholic sax intro
to "Detroit B lues".
Ranging over a variety of s t y l e s , the
music is never allowed to get careless
and they remain w e l l in control of the
sound rather than drifting along w i t h it.
The band have their faults though.
With their a b i l i t y , what are they doing
bashing out soft pop like "Streamline
guitar" or old drongos viz "The dashing
White Sergeant". T h e y are simply
depreciating the rest of the album. 100
lines for the most infantile cover of 1975.

I H A D read somewhere that Todd

notable only for its complete blandness
and mediocrity throughout. No expense
spared to make T O T P on this o n e . J u m p y

The B-side is of far more interest,-a
Zappra-espue running instrumental
degenerating into a steel-drum mardi gras

Richard Rodney Bennett plays
George Gershwin and Billy Mayer I
(Polydor)
After ten minutes listening to solo piano
play of tunes obscure and w e l l known I
decided this was not my cup of tea. Being
esconsed at home for the vacation I resol
ved to consult the talent at my d i s p o s a l .
At this juncture my brothers entered the
room. 'What's this rubbish', uttered the
first before I could speak. 'Yea, whats this
garbage', echoed the s e c o n d . 'Two vote
miss', I thought. Mr Bennett had by now
rushed his way through the 18 tunes (yes,
18 tracks) on side one,of which I recog-
nised the first and last 'Swanee' and '/ got
Rhythm'. A l l the others inbetween were
(apparently) vintage Gershwin.
Side two c o n s i s t s of B i l l y Mayerl tunes,
k i c k i n g off with 'Marigold'. Undaunted by
my brothers opinions I consulted the only
piano player in the household (mothers are
usefui sometimes). 'Doesn't the piano need
tuning, dear?', was the response as Mr
Bennett hurled round the v i n y l grooves into
'Ace of hearts', T h i s only left the head of
the household, who questioned the quality
of the actual playing. So as ' R a i l r o a d
Rhythm' faded from the air I was left with
the result: Four say M i s s . So do I.
