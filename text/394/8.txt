Dissatisfied Karl resigns
Karl Ibrikian who was elected Chairman of the Imperial C o l l e g e
Postgraduate Group only last term, has resigned h i s p o s t . Mr
Ibrikian took h i s d e c i s i o n after a great deal of introspection and
and strenuous efforts to achieve a basis for dialogue with the
then U n i o n officers. In d e c i d i n g to resign he s a i d " / based my
thoughts on the existing relations between the PG and UG sect-
ions of the Union; the present state of PG affairs and the facil-
ities afforded to the PG Group within the Union structure and
for", he s a i d . He a l s o added
came to the •conclusion that the
powers vested in me would not
enable me to do my job well".
The impossibility of the s i t u -
ation had forced him to r e s i g n .
When he spoke to F E L I X ,
Mr Ibrikian pointed out that
ICWA which represents far few-
er people enjoys priviledges
and has f a c i l i t i e s denied to the
I C P G G . F o r instance, ICWA
receives a grant of £750 w h i l s t
the I C P G G only receives £300 .
"People have got to realise
that PG's have special inter-
ests which must be catered
that he h a d no " r e a l p o w e r s "
within the U n i o n structure and
and had to rely on h i s " p o w e r s
of p e r s u a s i o n " if he wanted-
anything done.
There were three demands
being made on behalf of post-
graduates and these were:
(i) I C P G G should receive a
grant of at least £1000;
(ii) A P G lounge/common room
should be provided w i t h i n the
Union premises for the use of
postgraduates;
(iii) T w o places should be res-
erved in h a l l s of residence for
officers of the I C P G G .
The I C P G G had done what
little"they could and it was now
up to the President " t o restruc-
ture the Union to take into
account the demands of the P G
G r o u p . H e has the power to do
•this — the P G A O c a n , at this
stage, only a d v i s e " .
Tom Abraham, last year's
P G A O , is continuing i n a n
a c t i n g capacity until a new
P G A O is e l e c t e d . Commenting
on Mr Ibrikian's resignation he
s a i d , " u . I fully understand
and sympathise with his reasons
for doing s o . I b a c k K a r l ' s
demands f u l l y . The I C P G G is
more representative of P G ' s
than any individual P G on C o u n -
c i l ... and for the Union to try
and represent P G ' s while i g -
noring the I C P G G would be
tantamount to f r a u d " .

success
Richard Afton, the w e l l -
known T V c r i t i c of the E v e n i n g
N e w s , v i s i t e d the S T O I C
studios a few weeks ago at
their i n v i t a t i o n . H e w a s most
impressed with the standard
and quality of programmes
produced by S T O I C despite
many t e c h n i c a l h a n d i c a p s . H e
was s o pleased that he
mentioned Mark C a l d w e l l
(STOIC Chairman) and C o l i n
Grimshaw ( T V Studio T e c h -
nician) i n h i s column the
following week:-
"Two young men, unheralded
and unknown, are doing a
remarkable job in television at
the Imperial College.
"Considering certain tech-
nical deficiencies which are not
their fault, the output — which
consists of educational
programmes, news items, film
talks and interviews with
famous people — is well up to
professiona I standards".
S T O I C have a l s o recently
completed their first ever
programme to be recorded
outside the C o l l e g e . T h e I L E A
allowed them to make use of
their training studioat Battersea
to record the programme (an
interview with T i m Curry —
star of T h e R o c k y Horror
P i c t u r e Show) which w i l l be
going out on C h a n n e l 7 next
term. T h e interview will b e
shown i n College on the 8th
October. It is one of four
programmes recorded by S T O I C
that are t o be shown o n C h a n n e l
7 which is received by 90
universities, and p o l y t e c h n i c s .
In ' addition, approximately
1000 I L E A schools could a l s o
receive the programmes if they
s o desired.
Their next venture is a
v i s i t to E l s t r e e Studios, later
this month, where a new Hammer
horror f i l m , T o D e v i l A
Daughter, is being f i l m e d . The
K i n g of Horror, Christopher Lwa,
w i l l be being interviewed on
this o c c a s i o n .

Student's room
ransacked
Mr Ramjan Mohanty a n
E l e c E n g Student yesterday
had h i s room i n B e i t H a l l
ransacked i n the late afternoon.
He had 2 Cameras, a Tape-
recorder and a calculator stolen
amongst other things.
The robbery follows the loss
of his room keys the previous
evening i n the B e i t T V lounge.
However the keys were returned
to him by the B e i t messengers
when he enquired a n hour later.
There were no v i s i b l e s i g n s
of a forced entry but the theif
used Mr Mohanty's knife to
break into h i s drawer from
which the two cameras were
stolenl'The theif a l s o rifled
the wardrobe.
Mr D a w s o n , the Security
Officer, was informed and the
police c a l l e d . A finger print
expert was brought in and he
gave the room a thorough going
over.
A police spokesman s a i d
later that i n h i s haste the
culprit had left a valuable clue
which leads them to belief that
an early arrest is imminent.

hurt i n lab
explosion
A t e c h n i c i a n working i n a
Biopolymer Group laboratory
in the R o y a l School of Mines
received burns to the face and
chest when an explosion
occurred i n the fume cupboard
in which she w a s working. A t
the time of the explosion Ms
Sheila L a n c h l a n , the t e c h n i c i a n ,
was pouring propqlyne oxide
into a small beaker.
A gas burner which w a s
alight i n the fume cupboard
caused the built up vapours
from the oxide to ignite. That
is the theory being put forward
and i s based on eyewitness
accounts of what took place I
Ms L a n c h l a n w a s taken to St
Stephens hospital where she i s
recovering from shock and
burns.
There w a s some confusion
when firemen arrived i n
response to the emergency c a l l .
They arrived outside the
P h y s i c s department and were
then directed to the back of
the R o y a l School of M i n e s .
There they were directed to
the wrong section of the
b u i l d i n g . However, they
eventually found the l a b , but
by that time the fire had been
put out and the technician
taken to h o s p i t a l .
In future emergencies,
people w i l l be posted at a l l
entrances to ensure the fire-
brigade gets to the scene
immediately on a r r i v a l .
Cont'd from front page
the d e c i s i o n , and what is
more the money w h i c h is being
used to pay the Norths ide
cleaners is being diverted
from the Southside and L i n s t e a d
cleaners' Christmas bonus. It
therefore appears to be with
some degree of justification
t h a t t h e N U P E B r a n c h
Committee c a l l e d for a work-to-
rule in protest.
