H e l l o ! T h i s i s my first article in F E L I X
and I approach it with some trepidation,
particularly as it is for the P . G . i s s u e .
Having spent three years here a s an under-
graduate I seem to have little grasp of the
many problems facing P . G . s . I am anxious
to learn, and you are the only people that
can provide me with a knowledge of P G
affairs. Below I intend to set out some prob-
lems a s I see them. If you don't agree, then
tell me s o the next time you see me.
C V C P report on PG's
One of the most noticeable developments
affecting P G s for sometime was the publi-
cation of the Committee of V i c e - C h a n c -
ellors and P r i n c i p a l ' s ( C V C P ) Report on
Post-Graduate education. Many people have
looked-forward to its publication and I am
sure they w i l l a l l be quite satisfied with
the results. It has stated in simple terms
many of the feelings which Postgraduates
have held for a considerable time. A t last a
body of reasonable power has set down on
paper, that it feels that the P G grant is i n -
adequate. They rightly, say that 'It takes
little or no account of the fact that research
students are older, better qualified, more
experienced and more capable than the
average undergraduate'. I hope that this
statement w i l l lead to some action, and a
revision of the P G grant system. The c o l l -
ege w i l l be setting up a committee to d i s -
c u s s the report and to ascertain its rele-
vance to Postgraduate education within the
col lege.
Refectory prices
A s those of you who have been eating in
the refectories this summer w i l l have
noticed the refectory prices went up by 40%
on 1st September. T h i s increase is massive
in proportion, compared to the increases in
P G and U G grants and makes many local
cafes and restauraunts much more competit-

ive. I hope that you w i l l a l l look around to
get the best value for your money, whether
this means eating outof C o l l e g e or bringing
sandwiches. Postgraduates are affected
more serously than others by an increase at
this time of year as the P G grant is not i n -
creased until October. We made this point
quite clear to the C o l l e g e Governing Body.
They delayed the increase from 1st August
until 1st September but were unwilling to
delay it any longer. So the Postgraduates
bear the brunt of the increases again! A t
the second Union Meeting of next term it is
hoped that we w i l l be able to take some
action towards this Increase. Your ideas
and comments w i l l be appriciated at or
before that meeting.
Accomodation for married PG's
Approximately 40% of the students at IC
are postgraduates and looking back over
previous years the Union does not seem to
have achieved a great deal for postgrad-
uates. T h i s year perhaps more can be done,
although I appreciate that good intentions
are not enough. One project that I person-
a l l y , feel we should take up with the C o l l -
ege, is the lack of accomodation for married
postgraduates, I was a l s o surprised at the
lack of s o c i a l events for those students in
C o l l e g e over the summer. D o you feel that
there is a demand for such events? What
sort of events, if organised, would receive
your support?
Demonstrating cuts
The Government, following its policy of
cutting P u b l i c expenditure is expected to
announce more P u b l i c expenditure cuts in
the near future. Education is certain to bear
a large proportion of the cuts and the
effects w i l l be far reaching. F o r postgrad-
uates the cuts may first be felt as the
amount of demonstrating may have to be
curtailed due to the lack of funds. With a
somewhat inadequate P G grant many P G ' s
rely on demonstrating to supplement their
grant and the loss of this source of income
could be most damaging in some c a s e s . T h e
amount of finance available for research
projects may a l s o have to be reduced. I am
sure that the C o l l e g e would like to keep up
the high level of research for w h i c h . I C i s
renowned,but this w i l l become increasingly
difficult in the future. T h e campaign to
fight the Education cuts i s e s s e n t i a l l y a
campaign to see the higher educational
system we have at present continued.
PGAO
Many of the issues which w i l l affect the
students of IC in the coming year w i l l affect
the Postgraduates and to represent your
views? on these matters adequately it is
e s s e n t i a l that we have a Postgraduate
Affairs Officer. T h i s post is vacant at the
moment, if you are interested I would be
only too pleased to chat to y o u about the
job. It is a very difficult job and one which
needs great motivation.
I have outlined some of the events of past
and future which affect Postgraduates. Y o u
form about 4 0 % of the student body of I C
and are 40% of the membership of I C Union
If you don't feel that the Union achieves
enough for postgraduates please t e l l me,
but be prepared to join in yourself. I C
Union is your Union a s much as it i s the
undergraduates U n i o n . I am sure that we
can achieve a great deal for P G s in the
future but you must tell us the issues that
you want us to take up, and be prepared to
work with us to see that some progress is
made.
P G A O resignation-
the President replies
/ feel that I should reply, on behalf of
the Union, to the article on the resign-
ation of Karl Ibrikian who was to have
been next year's Postgraduate Affairs
Officer. I am sorry that Karl thought it
necessary to resign as I feel that we could
have worked quite well together, and ach-
ieved a great deal for the PG's at IC.
Many references are made to the lack
of power vested in the PGAO. The post
carries as much power as any other on the
Union Council, and the debate about the
PGAO being a member of the Executive
was fully aired last session. One must
not forget that the post of the PGAO has
only been in existence for three years.
This is quite a short time when one con-
siders changing the complete structure of
the Union.
Turning to the finances of the Post-
graduate Group, Karl says that ICWA
represents fewer people but receives more
money. Firstly may I point out that ICPGG
only submitted a claim tor £360 for this
session. The Union Finance Committee
can hardly be expected to hand out money
above that claimed. The claim submitted
was extremely sketchy and contained no
detailed budgeting and therefore adequate
room was left for trimming down the claim.
Secondly I would argue that the number of
people participating in those events org-
anised by a particular group was a far
better guide to the amount of money need-
ed than the number of people that a group
represents.
Karl should realise that the President
can not change the structure of IC Union,
however much he sometimes wishes he
could. The only body that can do this is
is a Union General Meeting, and these
do not seem to be attended by many PG's.
I would now like to consider the
demands of the postgraduates. I can see
nothing at all wrong with the Union fin-
ancing ICPGG to the tune of £1000. We
cannot be expected to do this unless the
£1000 Is claimed for, and justifiable. The
provision of a PG lounge within the Union
Building would be a little difficult at the
moment. I wonder it this is some form of
elitism wishing to keep PG's separate
from UG's, or a demand made while look-
ing at the ICWA lounge. If it is the latter,
then people must realise the historical
reasons for ICWA having its own lounge.
It goes back to the time of the 'men-only'
Union Bar. Two places in Hall are dem-
anded by the PG's. Most of the other
sectors of the Union only have one officer
that can take a LHtkm place in Hall. Why
do the PG's feel that they need two?
Such a move would need a constitutional
change and until that was possible I had
promised Karl one of the President's
nominee places . Since his resignation
the place has had to go to an undergrad-
uate officer as there is no PGAO to take
up the place. Finally it seems that all we"
receive from the ICPGG are demands, a n d
no requests or suggestions of ways in
which we can work closer together. Does
ICPGG want to be a part of the Union or
an independent group ?
To answer Tom Abraham'scoomments I
would only say that the Union Council
has five postgraduate members, excluding
the PGAO, and it can only be more rep-
resentative with him than without him.
Surely it you feel under-represented the
last thing that you should do Is take
away the representative that you have.
I would like to see more done this
year for postgraduates, but I wonder whe-
ther Karl's methods are the best for
achieving the postgraduates aims.
