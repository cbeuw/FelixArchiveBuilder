PG representation
There w i l l be many important i s s u e s ,
some more important than others, facing
the President amd Imperial College Union
as a whole, in the coming academic
s e s s i o n . T h e first of these has already
materialised although the issue i s not a
new one. K a r l Ibrikian's resignation a s
P G A O has not helped i n the very important
question of postgraduate representation
in I C U n i o n . On the contrary, it has
destroyed any b a s i s there might have
existed for d i s c u s s i n g and hopefully
finding a solution, if indeed one e x i s t s ,
within the present context and structure
of the U n i o n .
One hopes that the overtures that have
been made by the President w i l l receive a
r e s p o n s e / F o r K a r l to sit back and say
Mutters Arising
H a i l , a l l seekers of eternal truth and
w i s d o m . D u r i n g the summer months the
Union has been gathering itself for the
deluge of Freshers which w i l l shortly fall
out of the s k i e s onto-us. F i r s t l y , for those
of you who d o not know me, let me s a y
h e l l o . H e l l o ! I am John D o w n s , recently
graduated in Material S c i e n c e . I hope to
prove an efficient and friendly H o n . S e c .
in the coming year.
I hope you w i l l use the U n i o n , if only
to get half-price rail fares, w h i c h , by
some curious coincidence brings me to my
first piece of information. After much d i l l y -
dallying British R a i l have announced that
the new R a i l cards w i l l cost £5.40 and
w i l l run for a year from 1st October. Y o u
can obtain your R a i l card either by post
(forms w i l l be available in the Union
Office) or at E u s t o n . However, a l l those
requiring a R a i l card w i l l have to possess
a registration card.
T h i s brings up another couple of bits
of tittle-tattles. F i r s t l y , a passport photo
w i l l be required for this year's Union
card; secondly, students are needed for
the first three days of the Autumn term to
man the desks where the registration
cards (complete with photos) w i l l be
stamped. T h e Union w i l l be paying £1.00
per hour to anyone able to man a desk, s o
if you need some extra cash let me know.
At these desks there w i l l a l s o be three
handbooks available — the I C U , N U S , and
U L U handbooks — and these w i l l contain
information on welfare, the law etc. and
are absolutely free. Please make sure you
take one (or all) of these handbooks.
Another delicate area at the moment Is
accomodation. In the absence of a Student
Residence Officer (he failed his exams)
I am trying to organise some sort of
scheme to cater for those homeless ones
coming up for the start of term . If you
have, either problems In your own situation
or a spare place In your flat, please let
me know s o that we can overcome this
cronlc problem. In addition, ICWA i s
running a s i m i l a r scheme to cater specif-
ically for flatsharlng.
Looking t o future Hon Sec "Mutters
Arising", I hope to run reviews on such
diverse topics a s NUS T r a v e l , E n d s l e i g h ,
the Implications of the 1974 Rent A c t and
accomodation generally. If you have any
that previous Union administrations have
done nothing and cast the blame on the
present administration i s wrong. H e did
not, on his own admission, speak to the
present Union officers regarding P G
representation and needs before his
r e s i g n a t i o n .
E v e r y move to resolve the problem
must be welcimed and A L L parties must
be involved i n the negotiations.'The b a l l
is now definitely in the court of the I C P G G .
Security
The centralisation of the process for
booking U n i o n rooms should mean that the
sort of scenes witnessed a few weeks ago
in the Union gym become a thing of the
p a s t . The particular culprits involved have
apologised and the matter has been
amicably s e t t l e d . However, they w i l l be
contributions, ie have you been ripped-off
by any of them or you feel particularly
w e l l served by N U S T S or a particular
landlord, drop me line.
That sums it up for now; needless to
say, there are a multitude of elections
coming up. A comprehensive list w i l l be
published s o o n . If you are at a l l interested
in standing, please come to the Union to
see "where it's all at".

The final arrangements are being
delayed by a large number "I clubs and
societies not yet having returned a
completed form. I would l i k e to ask those
members of College to contact me a s soon
as possible to obtain a s t a l l . The last
date for this i s 20th September.
Most clubs and societies can expect to
receive the details of arrangements early
in the week commencing Monday 22nd
September.
The Union Lower Lounge, Bot/Zoo
common room and the Union lower
refectory have been redecorated during
the summer at a considerable cost. There-
fore, I would l i k e to request that people
not put any posters on the w a l l s as they
destroy paintwork. Notice boards are at
present being made to accomodate the
needs of those people who w i s h to d i s p l a y
posters.
Do approach me if you need any help
during the next year or for that matter, if
you feel you want to comment on anything
the Union Is doing. I w i l l be only too
pleased to listen to your point of view.
Hope you have a pleasant year both
academically and s o c i a l l y .
