DP clashes with
kung-fu club
"Kung-fu" school has been using the Union gym twice
a week without booking or paying for it for nearly a year'.
The situation came to notice when members of IC Soccer
Club tried to make use of the gym three weeks ago. They
were told somewhat rudely, to leave at once by a hot-
• tempered teacher leading the lesson.
The matter w a s brought to
the attention of the Deputy
President, R i z Shakir, w h o
after extensive investigations
discovered that the school had
not booked the gym. However,
Mr C h a n g , the tutor, i n s i s t s
that they d i d have a booking
which was granted them b y the
A C C Chairman, John Thorn back.
When asked to produce h i s
" b o o k i n g n o t e " on the night of
Wednesday, 3rd September Mr
Chang was extremely rude and
said to R i z " G o away boy, I ' m

by R i z to come down to h i s
office w i t h i n 3 0 minutes t o

otherwise he would c a l l the
police. A t t h i s , one of the
pupils threatened " Y o u ' l l do i t

In the event, R i z decided
to first a s k B e i t security to go
and a s k Mr C h a n g to produce

We went u p t o the gym and
at the sight of 50 kung-fu

considerably. T h e y asked Mr

Seaford snubs N U P E agreement
T H E C L E A N I N G ladies i n L i n s t e a d and Southside H a l l s of
Residence began a work-to-rule last Monday i n protest against
the d e c i s i o n by C a r l Seaford, the C o l l e g e Domestic Bursar, to
ignore a n agreement made b y the C o l l e g e and N U P E (the public
employees* trade union) over bonuses t o be paid during the
summer.
It i s during the long
vacation that L i n s t e a d a n d
Southside are used a s hotels
for conferences a n d summer
tourists. T h e extra workload
for the cleaning ladies i n this
period i s known to be sub-
stantial .
About a month before the
hotel scheme commenced, M r
T e d F i s h e r (the branch
secretary) a n d Mrs A l i c e
F e a s e y ( shop steward) a c t i n g
on behalf of N U P E entered into
an agreement w i t h the C o l l e g e ,
which w a s represented b y Mr
A . O . R o l a n d , (the a s s t .
P e r s o n n e l Secretary) and Mrs
Audrey Podhajsky (the a s s t .
Domestic Bursar). The- agree-
ment, w h i c h w a s made i n Mr
Seaford's absence due t o
i l l n e s s , stated that out of the
monies accrued from the. hotel
scheme, the cleaners i n
L i n s t e a d a n d Southside
would receive a £4 per week
bonus o n account of the extra
workload i n v o l v e d . T h e
figure of £4 w a s worked out
from the definite conference
bookings w h i c h were known a t
the time the agreement w a s
m a d e . A d d i t i o n a l l y , a percentage
of the monies accrued from
the c a s u a l lettings w a s to be
forwarded to the cleaners a t a
later date as a Christmas bonus.
No provision was made for the
" N o r t h s i d e " (Weeks, Garden
and B e i t H a l l s of Residence)
cleaners s i n c e they d i d not
handle the hectic summer
visitor traffic and they already
were receiving a year round
bonus of £1 .50 per week and
working an extra hour each day.
The dispute arose when Mr
Seaford recently decided to pay
the Northside cleaners a £2.50
per week bonus, which with
the £ 1 5 0 per week made a
total of £4 per w e e k . The new
bonus i s to be backdated to
the beginning o f the summer.
The Southside and L i n s t e a d
cleaners were angry at the
unfair financial advantage being
shown to the N o r t h s i d e
c l e a n e r s . There had been n o '
consultation w i t h N U P E over ,
