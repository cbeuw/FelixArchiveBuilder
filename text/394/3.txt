FELIX 3
Sidevlew of the new Huxley
The move to W2 is now nearly
complete and the building should
be ready by the beginning of term.
No date has yet been fixed for an
official opening of W2 which is to
be named the Huxley Building.' Wl
is being officially opened some-
time in December and is being
named, The Blackett Laboratory,
after Lord Blackett, late Fellow of
Imperial College. A memorial
lecture is to be given at the opening.
W2 will be occupied by the Maths,
C C D and Physics departments .
The new RCS office is also in W2
off the walkway. The old Meteoro-
logy department has been
amalgamated with the Physics
department and now the atmospheric
Physics section.
Those using the lifts in the new
Huxley building may have noticed
the different labelling of levels on
the outside and inside the lifts.' On
the outside the level numbers read
1, ...',5,6,6M,7 and on the inside
they read 1, ..,6,7M,7 . The error is
being rectified.'The correct coding
is the former.'This is all in order
that levels in the Physics building
may correspond to those in W2 and
vice versa.
W2 has taken two and a half years
to build and by the time all costs
are totted-up, will have cost in
excess of Â£3 million .
