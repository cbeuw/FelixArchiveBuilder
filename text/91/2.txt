PROFILE
" KITCH"
S.A.K. CELEBRATING HIS TBEnTIEDBT BIHTHDAY,
In spite of the physical resemblances of the disting-
uished trio, the President's right hand man is actually much
younger than Eisenhower and. Kruschev, -^s recently as 1953 he
fled, clutching a first, from the ?hysic3 department to Chem.
Tech., where he studies crystal growth. No man for blinkered
academicism, Kitchener has been rugger club secretary, cricket
captaih, secretary of the A.C.C. and secretary of the TTnion;
and none of these offices will ever be quite the same again.
Shorn of various fictional embellishments, (originated by
himself) i t must be said that Kitoh's performances as wing
tlireequarter and goal-kicker have been something less than
brilliant; but none can deny (or explain) his successes at
cricket. He picked up the rudiments of this game in 1951,
from the great college players of that time, and last season
made two tedious centuries among other innings pf lessor
lenffthr some, indeed, of ludicrous brevity.
Those tired of hearing hi:.i on Surrey's cricketing
predominance may usefully recall that he is a native of Essex,
but i t was at school in Epsom that ICitchener gained his ency-
clopaedic knowledge of the classics, and the ability to recite
a list of Derby winners, jockeys, owners and tr-dners. On
Epsom golf course, too, he claims to have gone round, in 99-
A veterenhostel-dweller, (fioom 28 lias hod to be reconstructed
at enormous expense), and former carnival cabaret star, 'The
Gnome' waxes most sociable md eloquent over a jar °f ale,
and iias done so in many places
from the Turk's Head in
Exeter to the Prinsen ICellder
in Delft. Thus was developed
the formidable vehemence of
speech which enlivens Council
meetings and committees, and
stirs procrastinating planners
to speed completion of the •
"
Union building. As secretary,
man of sport and international
oonvivialist^I'dtohener serves
the Union well, while contri-
butin- to its gaiety by his
taste for bizarre I.eadgear,
ancient shoes and impromptu ,
Karris i»noing. Par the reoord,
he is allergic to triumphant
Tfelshme;:, good bowling, the
-'.nger oat, tlie quiet l i f e
and Green Chartreuse, but may
yet overcome this last anti-
pathy.
During one of the "tedious" centuries the writer of this
profile oame into bat with a purposeful air, intent on running
roe out, but became the laughing stock of the team by being out
first ball. s . -

Bridge Players Move
Members of the I.C. Bridge Club f i r s t team
have survived t h e i r briage-playing tour of north-
ern Europe. Their v i c t o r i e s are confined t o the
moral f i e l d , but those mathematicians who follow
the pools may devote themselves t o computing the
odds on four draws i a seven matches.
Those who prefer t o follow form may consider
such factors as the Leidan Club's craft y provision
of two bridge teams. One team kept the a i r ringing
for two hours with cries of " K e l l n e r S Acht P i l s l '
and then generously assisted the v i s i t o r s t o the
tables where more apper adversaries l a y i n wait.
In view of the excellence of the German
cigars and beer the team f e l t inclined t o forgive
Cologne f o r f i e l d i n g a team which consisted of
one German and three inscrutable o r i e n t a l s from
Peking.
The h o s p i t a l i t y extended by U n i v e r s i t i e s from
Brussels t o Gothenberg included a remarkable
c o l l e c t i o n of beverages ranging from near beer t o
beer, schnapps, snaps and aquavit. I n addition the
delights of smorgasbord w i l l ever brighten the
thoughts of the participants as they trudge with
leaden feet t o Mooney's Ptomaine Palace,
Other continental refinements encountered
included a lady lavatory attendant i n Brussels,
who s o l i c i t o u s l y assisted the s t a r t l e d t r a v e l l e r s
to select the appropriate u t e n s i l .
In conclusion i t can be stated that the
length of time t h i s t r i p w i l l remain i n the
player's memories w i l l be equalled only by the
memories of the staff of the TEMFERANCE HOTEL, i n
Copenhagen, who had t o assist the belated team
to t h e i r rooms after a night on the town.
Exploration ( Rehearsal )
The main section of the ryax^y arrived, in Jj&keiand on
Sunday to be greeted with the fact that two of the group had
had bad weather the' previous 3 days.and nights and had to
retire to lower ground to dry out a l l their ecpiipment, j'eplace
guys ropes and repair broken tent poles.
Bad weather on Sunday allowed Only two students to make
the rendezvous whilst one student pitched his solitary tent on
a site near cairq? one but to date .has no idea where he was
that lonely night*
Five attempted to make camp one from Langdale but in had
weather camp was set up at 2000', under the Bowfell 'crags.
That night_every camp suffered under bad conditions,h^gh gusty
winds, a l i t t l e rain, and the tents enveloped in clouds •
The following day at camp one, 5 of the group decided
should bad weather continue a retreat to 'lower ground in
Borrowdale should be made* Two of the group under Bowfell
moved down into Langdale straightways and canned among the
glacial moraines to link up with 3 more who Iiad come back up
valley for more punislinente The following morning found the
remaining three who stayed another night under Bowfell slowly
coming down Rossett Gxll, It appeared as i f they had overnight
taken both their tents and sleeping bag3 for^a swim in /ingle
tarn*nothing was dry. Our poor tents would not stay tho
pace, we were the only ones in all Lakeland who had defied the-
elements for so long, in fact too long*
The rest of the •..our was successful much training being
done. The most noteworthy was the feat of 3 wen at camp one
climbing a l l the Lakeland 30C0r
pouirfcains in 23 hours* Alsp
another group of 3 -
~
p
«
n
t one comfortable night in a Ooniston
Hotel* Several severe climbs were .done by other groups as we
•vjell as much walking and peak "bagging".
The personnel in each group combined well and many friend-
ships were founded and every hour used to advantage, returns
to camp being made in complete blackness.
By Friday all our equipment Iwl dried -out and most of us
had covered large areas of lakeland,.
