Gronigen Gin Greeting
The a r r i v a l at Liverpool Street Station on
March 2 d
t h of thirteen Dutch hockey players from
Crronlngen University, each carrying a l i t r e bottle
of aenever din, marked the beginning of a festive
week for the Hockey Club. The Old Hostel echoed once
more to the sound of Dutch voices and "Sodom eta
opp'a" (spelling open to correction).
Three games were played by Q-ronlngen and three
by I.e. i n the Hockey Festival held over the Easter
Weekend at the National Physical Laboratories'
ground at Teddlngton. The v i s i t o r s won one and lost
two, and we won two and lost one. A special match
was arranged on Easter Sunday between I.C. and
flroningen which I.C. won undeservedly by 2 goals to
1. The Dutch style of hockey i s considerably more
delicate than ours, being modelled on the Indian
rather than the English type of game. However, the
sides were evenly matched, and a r e a l l y enjoyable
game resulted.
From the f i r s t day, when three Dutchmen d i s -
appeared i n pursuit of three obviously well inform-
ed Swedish damsels, to the fahewell party held on
their last night i n England, considerable interest
was shown i n matters other than those pertaining
to hookey. Soho i n general, and the Club Tabu i n
p a r t i c u l a r were frequented. Some amusement was
caused by an a r t i c l e i n a Sunday newspaper, well
known for i t s uncovering of vice i n the West-End,
dealing with a midnight "Orgy of Jazz" a t which
several of the "Nederlandern" were present.
Undoubtedly, the most memorable part of the
V i s i t was the previously mentioned fafiewell party
In tne Old Hostel. The Warden was Informed well i n
advance, and he abandoned ship several days before
the revels began. Liquor, food and nurses were im-
ported i n quantity to cater for a l l tastes. Beer
flowed freely, mainly over the floor of the capt-
ain's room which served as the bar. A f t e r two hours
sleep on Wednesday morning, thirteen t i r e d but happy
Dutchmen returned to their native heath with pleas-
ant i f somewhat hazy recollections of tholr stay a t
I.C.
GREAT GAME GOLF • • •
Last weekend a group of I.C. golfers l e f t t h e i r
cares behind them for the annual outing to Cooden
Beach. The more fortunate ones travelled by t r a i n
while the remainder of the party whq had l e f t i n
a covered Jeep arrived i n an open Jeep, having had
a s l i g h t argument involving a ditch and a hedge on
the way. ftolf was taken seriously on the Saturday,
a Medal Competition being won by K.B.Walker. In
the evening entertainment was provided by T.Mc.
Velgh on guitar and various people on piano.
The aolflng Association's President, a l o c a l
resident, was accompanied home by several members
and, after a l i t t l e l i q u i d refreshment, a short
cut was taken for the return t r i p . This involved
several f i e l d s , ditches and barbed wire fences so
that most people were ready for bed on return t o
the Dormy House. A. Kitchener, however, was report-
ed to have been seen wandering about some hours
later clutching a pint pot of bear.
aolf didn't appear to suffer too much, f o r a.Park-
lnson returned forty points i n a Stableford comp-
e t i t i o n on the Sunday morning and was almost caught
i n the afternoon by D«Butters with 39 points.
The return trip' was made after tea, the missing
parts of the Jeep being retrieved from the d i t c h
and secured with rope. Alltogether a most success-
f u l l nesting which one ;hopes w i l l be repeated many
times.
In the spring Meeting on March 2«nd, at Wentworth
the President's Prize was won by M.(J.Hampton and
the Glover Cup by K.B.Walker. Exceptionally bad
weather was responsible f o r many high scope*.
The eve of t h i s combined R.C.S. and C.4 a.
tour was marked by sensation, the d i l a t o r y D.M.
Thomas losing a l l the t i c k e t s , Whilst searchers
padded about the Union i n pyjamas and macintoshes,
the booming voice of Thomas reassured everyone that
i t probable didn't r e a l t y matter and, indeed, t h i s
same voice succeeded i n persuading dubious Dutch
ofilolaJts that a i l was well.
Early on the day or departure a l l were awakened
by alarm clocks: a l l that i s escept B.Hearn, inside
whose head a ringing noise breaks out whatever time
he wishes tx> get up, thus making tne use of an alarm
unnecessary. The team enjoyed a perfect crossing,
which was marred only by an unexpected closing of
the bar by the captain, who I t was rumoured, feared
for the safety of the ship.
The f i r s t match was R.C.S. versus Amsterdam, and
i t attracted a reasonable crowd, who no doubt anti.
cipated an e x h i b i t i o n of tne finer points of the ga^ie
by the b r i l l i a n t B r i t i s h exponents, Although the team
took some time to settle down, they eventually
Produced some very good passing movements and won
17-11.
The following day the Guilds met
Weuve, the Shell O i l Company team,
which constats mainly of Englishmen, a,
someof them old students of I.C.
The match was close throughout, and
Guilds'were unlucky to lose 8-6. At
one stage B.Hearn, despite a multi-
p l i c i t y of muscular and ligament, r y
defects, forced himself across tne
Shell l i n e , but unluckily dropped
the b a l l without grounding i t prop-
erly. The large crowd was very app-
reciative of the excellent play.a.id the Shell team
entertained us royally after the game. Those who
remember K.F.Patrick w i l l be shocked to hear he
drunk as a lord.
The next two days were spent i n works v i s i t s .
One of these was to a brewery, and tne second to a
liqueur works .where the famous Dutch 'Genever' i s
made. No d e t a i l s are a v a i l a b l e .
The tour finished with matches against the
University of Delft, whom Guilds beat 31-0 and
R.C.S. 23-0. Both games were played i n a very
friendly s p i r i t , and Guilds and R.C.S. both dem-
onstrated the arts of passing, catching, kicking,
and running straight very well.
Needless to add, the Dutch h o s p i t a l i t y was
magnificent, occasionally continuing to 5 a.m.
Many stories have been related, and w i l l be related
in the bar: to print them here would be to rob
them of t h e i r flavour.
Thank you, D.S.R.F.C. for a memorable v i s i t .
