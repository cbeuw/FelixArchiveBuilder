The following recipe i s published to Taring some
financial relief to.the diruilcing elasses. It is the only
information retained from a recent works visit of the
G*E.C. laboratories. It works out that a pint of beer costs
threepence i f materials, and the taste can be adjusted
byvar. ing the hops and malt content. The claim that the beer
made is three times as strong as ordinary, "beer awaits conf
firruation, since some drinkers allege that other factors
than alcoholic content must be considered. •
Required: 91b. dark brown sugar
. . 41b. malt extract.
4-6oz, dried hops
|>oe...granulated yeast.
l£oz. gelatine.

Simmer the hops in a half gallon of water for half an hour.
Place the malt and sugar in an enamel or copper vessel of
lOgal^ons capacity, and filter tap water from the heps into i t .

lUsiL-olve the yeast in a little tspid water (100°F.), and
odd to the solution. Cover, and leave for 6-7 days, when
bubbling should have ceased and the'beer..no longer.taste
sweet. (The froth can be removed 'after twenty-four hours,
since i t contains most of the sediment.)
The powdered gelatine should be dissolved in water and
added, and after a. further 12 hours, the beer should be
siphoned out directly into bottler containing a half teaspoon
of sugar.These should be screwed down tightly, m& left until
clear. It is then ready for drinking, but care should be take,-
not to disturb the mud when pouring. A -

If the beer is bottled to soon, or too nuch sugar is
added to the bottles,it will b^. too gaseous.
doidon syrup is 'invert sugar' and is considerid by some
to be a more satisfactory way of brewing than using a brown
sugar supplied locally. In this case, one pound of sugar is
equivalent to of golden syrup.

The Second Eight,rather a lip;ht crew, rowed well' up to
the standard set by last year's Second Eight, and finished
24th. Thus again we had., two crews in the first division.
The Yixnter Eight, otherwise known as the "Old Lags'*
crew, had a good sporting row. The passed six crews who
they claimed moved out of the way with great rapidity
on being threatened.
The rest of the crews rowed their utmost, but the
standard was higher this. year, than normal so that all the
crews, except the Winter Eight, lowered their placings.
-Moreover, the st.ndard of the Club's lower crews last year
was exceptionally high, and i t was inevitable that
most of them would drop. A word of warning to oia bcj?sm»n.
