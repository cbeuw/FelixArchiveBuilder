Dirty Deeds
You will all, of couse, remember
last term's spectacular Dirty Dozen
challenge, where a dozen eager
collectors from each hall set out to
raise as much dosh as humanly
possible in twelve hours. Mind you,
I'm sure there are some people who
would rather cast a veil over the
whole event - namely the team from
Falmouth Keogh, who staggered off
with a barrel of beer at the end of
the day. If you think you could raise
more than they did, have more fun,
or think up some stunt far sillier
than doing the conga in Covent
Garden, then Dirty Dozen Two is
for you.
Teams are already being mustered,
ready for the event, on March 6th.
Secrecy appears to be everything,
as Hall Reps are keeping their ideas
closely guarded from the
competition. As yet, only the
destinations and intended
benificiaries are known, although
we may be able to publish more
details closer to the time: Fisher are
intending to go to Dorking and
collect for BIBIC, whilst Garden,
Weeks, Tizard and Southwell are
all staying closer to home and using
the Cystic Fibrosis Trust's Greater
London licence to collect in the
capital. Falmouth Keogh are
returnng to the scene of their former
triumph, Guildford, where they will
be collecting for the Leonard
Cheshire Foundation, which helps
severely physically and mentally
handicapped people to live fuller
and more independent lives.
Bernard Sunley are planning to
collect for W W F N at the QPR v
Norwich match, and Willis Jackson
will be in Reading collecting for the
same charity. Linstead and Selkirk
are both keeping their destinations
under wraps for the time being, but
if you fancy joining in with the team
from your hall, pop along to your
Hall Rep and force them to tell you
what they're up to!
Running ahead
On April 18th, when most of us will
be enjoying our Easter break and
having a well-earned rest, one crazy
student from IC will be running the
London Marathon. Alex Taverner
hopes to complete the gruelling
course in under three hours, which
would put him amongst the top two
hundred runners. To get a place in
the race, Alex has had to undertake
to raise a thousand pounds for Tusk
Force, a charity primarily
concerned with protecting the
dwindling populations of elephants
and rhinos, and so far he has
obtained pledges for over £600. So
if you see Alex around college,
please sponsor him, and watch out
for him on the telly on the day!

Last year, Red Nose Day didn't
happen, leaving those of us with an
irrisistible urge to cram a sweaty
red plastic ball on our noses
completely in the lurch. But '93 is
different! Not only is Red Nose Day
back, but as you may have noticed,
it has also undergone a revamp -
instead of the normal nasty nose,
that cut into your nostrils and made
blowing yur nose almost
impossible, March 12th this year
offers you the opportunity to wear,
with pride, a red, plastic
TOMATO! Buildings, such as the
Natural History Museum, can have
their very own glowing tomatoes,
and the usual car version is already
present on the streets. And what, I
hear the voices of a thousand
students cry (those that aren't asleep
in their lectures at this very
moment, anyway) are we at
Imperial College going to do for
this amazing and fantabulous event?
That is for you yourselves to decide
- already the Chaplaincy have begun
collecting money to try to put a Red
Tomato on the Queen's Tower - this
has never been done before, so
please throw your loose change
their way (collecting tins can be
found in the Union bar). Any silly,
preferably tomato-related, ideas
will be welcomed, and you can
voice your suggestions at the Rag
meeting on Friday.
