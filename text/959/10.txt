Basketball in the USSR
The Imperial College Basketball team recall their trip
to Moscow to play against the world'sfinest and indulge
in a little of the Russian social life
Pia's only jump
As you have probably gathered, the
IC basketball club went to Moscow
for an international basketball
tournament on invitation from
MGIMO (the sports club of the
Moscow State Institute of
International Relations). IC played
against teams from Norway-
Tromso, Norway-Oslo, University
of Queensland—Australia,
University of Essec—France, the
national team of Iran, University of
Aberystwyth—Wales, University of
Sterling, Scotland and the
MGIMO—Russia.
Our team was by far the most
international, with members from
Cyprus, England (2Vi members),
Germany, Greece, Japan, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Venezuela and the
USA. The excitement began upon
arrival at Moscow airport where
our bus was 'arrested' and held up
for one hour while our driver was
threatened with a gun. Finally,
'connections' enabled us to get to
the Olympic village where we
stayed. We were greeted by a
committee of friendly (?) native
cockroaches. By the end of the
week, most of them were given a
name by Ines by which time Nellie
had been convinced to refrain from
keeping watch. Our first meal
consisted mainly of Russian mineral
water (Vodka) and very different
foods. A number of people put into
action the diet plans they could
never fulfil in London; others just
ate. Favourite substitutes for food
were chocolate, Vodka, vitamin
pills, Vodka, cake, Vodka,
Nurofen, glucose, Vodka. They
tried hard to please us in every
aspect but the Russian canteen food
was difficult to cope with while the
food in restaurants was first class
including caviar and champagne.

During the week, we visited the
Kremlin, The Red Square, the
Pushkin Museum, the Moscow
State Circus, the Bolshoi Theatre
and two famous markets; Arbat and
Izmailevo. We found Russian
architecture very interesting
especially Natasha who took loads
of pictures of corroding reinforced
concrete. She kept telling us it was
for her Phd but she got so excited
about it that we wondered. The
unbearably low temperatures of
—13 °C made .nearly all our team
members buy one of those
extremely fashionable Russian hats.
Also acquired were medals,
uniforms, Vodka, caviar, chess
sets, Matrioschakas and only two
Australian t-shirts (sorry Nelly), no
caps, you had to sleep with an
Australian to qualify for that.
On the basketball front, our
women strolled through the initial
games. The only challenge came in
the final against the Russian team
where we lost after fighting very
hard against the Russian 'Ice
Woman' (see Olympics). The lack
of height in our team was
compensated for by sound technical
abilities (Pia's jumping, Natasha's
bivot and Nellie's sharp shooting).
We ended up in second place after
the Russians who defeated
everyone.
The men secured a third place
victory in an easy game against the
Russian team after having lost
against the Australians and the
Iranians. Our men showed their
excellent offensive play in the
match against the Iranians but were
later to lose after their opponents
took advantage of gaps in our
defence and shifted to the 'run and
gun'. Impeccable shooting and good
team play by the Iranians ensured
yet another close victory at the
finals against Australia.
Lenin, Stalin,
Up and over!

'eature
26 February 1993
In typical Imperial College
tradition, we tried hard to keep up
with the Russian drinkers. Monica
continuously gave performances of
Portuguese songs and gymnastics if
she could stand up long enough.
Ines and Ralph concentrated on
strengthening international relations
with the Russians while Annette
was hiding from Alexie who tried
hard to improve the German-
Russian relations. Sally and Tom
gambled for rubels with the Scottish
team and got stripped. Sociable
Mike was having a snowball fight
against himself as no one would join
in (we love you Mike, really).
George gave a brilliant performance
of Greek dancing to Russian music
breaking his arm in four places in
the process, Opa! It was worth it
George!!
The trip was the first visit to
Russia for all the players and we all
really appreciated having had this
once in a lifetime opportunity.
At last, a chance to sleep
Although it took some time to get
accustomed to the accommodation,
catering (which was of a good
Russian standard) and the general
way of life we all had a great time
and made many friends. The
opportunity to play good basketball
was much appreciated.
An experience never to forget.
