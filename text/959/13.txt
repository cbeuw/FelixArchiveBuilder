Third on the bill to The Selecter, on
a sortie for the investigations unit,
we find Terry Hoax, totally
unsigned, unmanaged in the U K ,
and purveryors of the massively
MTV-played Depeche Mode cover,
'Policy Of Truth', bringing a
harsher metallic acrimony to the
climatic chorus, always lacking in
the original. This received long and
loud appreciation of the earlybird

Ex Giant Sand man with only two
Dobros at a very yuppie 50s
Americano diner. Damn, should've
gone yesterday at the Borderline.
Ry Cooder once said spiritual blues
gives chicken skin, well Rainer
(Robert Johnson incarnate) kitted
with old baseball cap and Budweiser
blows me away completely. Modest
as he is, he played sturming country
blues with total indifference, maybe
he doesn't realise the magnitude of
his power, or is put off by the
crowd too busy tucking into their
steaks after a hard day in the city.
Give a shit, the man is a genius
and that is all that matters.

J o i — I C U n i o n
It hurts to say this, you know. I
really don't want to. I've got a
reputation as a miserable git who
hates everything to keep up. so I
apologise in advance for the
following statement. I enjoyed this
band. I'm sorry, it has to be said,
and I don't care if they haven't got
any guitars and such, just a load of
tapes and stuff like that. It's the first
time I've danced at an Ents do this
year, and I'm rather ashamed of it,
so I'm going to end now. Bloody
good, Mr. Kerr, and I think I want
to kill you for it.

Strange really, they asked me to
write a review about the band
playing the Union on Thursday
night. But, I've never written a
music review, so like a good little
boy I decided to look at some
previous reviews from Felix,
Melody Maker, NME and I must
say I was quite shocked.
I thought the review should tell
you what the music was like. That
Ask offered a refeshing change
from the run of the mill indie bands
about at the moment and played an
ska fans, who have arrived to find
five germans armed with guitars
and phrasebooks rocking out on
stage.
But there's more to this band than
that cover. Every other song,
mostly from their 1992 album
'Freedom Circus', are finely crafted
rock songs, with a melody hiding
in the basement, and banging on the
doors, set free. This band, damn
this band, this band should be
signed very soon.

These guys gimbled and grooved in
the Union Lounge on Thursday
night and sounded excellent.
The lead guitarist/singer—
looking like an escaped hippy from
the first Joy of Sex manual—did
some nifty guitar work, while some
droog with a sax slunk a few slickly
soulful solos in now and again. This
droog, together with the bass player
occasionally went into Hare Krishna
mode, with blissful expressions and
happy bouncing up and down to the
music, and while this was kind of
corny, it was also infectious. Got
us bopping.
Musically, they were a mixture
of Frank Zappa, Ozric Tentacles
and Rush... sort of, that is. They had
an impressively tight rhythm guitar
and drums very like those bands,
anyway.
Good shit.
PJ.
exciting mix of atmospheric
melodies and pounding rhythms, all
topped with one of those ethereal
female voices, that used to make
Everett True go weak at the knees.
A sort of harsh, more vibrant form
of eighties music.
At worst I thought a lazy review
would make a few comparisons just
to avoid having to describe the
music. I was even thinking of
mentioning the Charlottes or an
extrovert Cocteau Twins myself,
But no. Apparently a good review
describes a wild party that you had
to go to instead of listening to the
record or the new t-shirt you
bought. Music seems to have little
to do with the review. So if I tell
you about the time I got completely
wrecked will you all pay a little
more attention to this and go down
to the Union to emulate some of my
amazing feats. Oh, whilst you're
there, check out the band, they're
good (and I was sober at the time.

Wendy James, because Colorama fucked up and couldn't develop
photos to save their life.
W e n d y J a m e s : the nameless

Ah, so The Seductive One returns,
having astutely dumped Tex and the
brothers Vamp, with a Costello-
penned single, and a promo photo
which suggests her to be mildly
embarrassed by her attributes. I ask
you, is this credible? I tend to think
this 'I suffer. I am the soul of all
womankind' stuff would carry more
weight if dear ol' Wend didn't get
her tits out at every available
opportunity. Maybe I'm getting the
photo all wrong. Maybe she's
'touching herself erotically' for
David Bailey's camera (who's he?
- sic. Ed). Maybe she's trying to
cover up that rip in her plastic
trousers that she bought from that
dodgy stall in Camden.
Hmmm. It concerns me that I don't
actually know what she's trying to
achieve here; I would speculate that

Considering this is the product of
the ex-members of Field of the
Nephilim who happen to be on tour
with Fish (spit, spit), this isn't
actually that bad. Not really what
you'd expect though; it being a
fairly standard rock issue. An
incessantly repeated chord sequence
bridged with a quieter middle bit,
and the general cry of 'Lord have
mercy on me now'. Easy, it's called
a power switch. Just depress.

she is attempting a Madonna-like
metamorphosis from petulant trashy
schoolgirl hanging out with sweaty
boys to clever manipulator of pop
iconography, but if she attempts to
establish this miracle with another
lumbering rock motif and Carter-
esque puns (read 'Lesley-Anne
Down in the tube station at
midnight' for a laugh), we're in
abso-fucking-lute non-starter
territory. The song 'the nameless
one' would appear to be generally
concerned with would-be stars,
nearly-was' and also rans'; with this
in mind, I think this should be
catalogued as 'that blonde tart who
used to sing with that band, now
what was their name?'

Suzanne Vega is great. She was
great when introspective and
intense, and is equally great now
she is happier with life.
'When Heroes Go Down' is as
uptempo as she's been; being short,
spritely and not involving lyrical
gymnastics. Just like a single should
be.
In case we'd forgotten the old
Suzanne, the B-side is a live version
of the earlier 'Knight Moves'. Both
toe-suckin' good.
