How to save your soul The sound of his own voice
Dear Jonty
If we examine the basis of Western
Civilisation we see that the roots of
this not-so-long established tree is
'freedom and benefit'. The
branches of this tree which bear the
fruits are very apparent:
-5 million crimes reported each
year
-50% increase in crime over the
last three years
-Less than 10% of criminals are
caught
-Only 1 in 10 people will help a
person who is being victimised
-40% of British people live under
the poverty line: £3,000 or less a
year
-68,000 lost their homes in 1992
-3,000 homeless sleeping on the
streets of London alone
-3 million unemployed, and half
a million companies bust in 1991.
There are, comaparatively, 95,000
millionaires in Britain.
It doesn't take a genius to
comprehend that this fallacy of
freedom and the viewpoint of
benefit are destroying this society.
What Islam has to offer is a
different set of criteria for action—
based on the rational conclusion of
the Creator's existence. The
Muslims criteria for action is not
one of individual benefit, but rather
one of accountability. The Islamic
system has been implemented for 13
centuries providing peace and
security for the non-Muslim and the
Muslim alike. What Islam has to
offer is not what we see in the
Middle East nations today; rather
these nations are enacting the orders
of their Western masters and
compromising the Islamic way of
life.
Graciously, the ignorance of the
ConSoc is forgiven, and the invite
Dear Jonty,
Just a word on the accusations of
pusillanimity levelled against
Gareth 'Beit back and don't give a
shit' Light last week. I reckon that
his excuse for not signing the article
about Rag Week—that he's the
Felix News Editor, and can't write
opinion on the news paper, nor
write the Editorial/Cat's Eyes bits
because they're not his turf—is a
load of old toss.
It's perfectly obvious that he's
just shit scared of getting twatted by
all those hard core raggies like
Womble and Josh. He probably
leads a secret double life as a Rag
Twat come to think of it. I bet at
the weekends he wears and anorrak
and goes around squirting people
with water pistols, and saying
' R A H R A H R A H ' a lot.
I mean why bother to get out of
bed in the morning if you're going
to be so transparent?
Get a life Gareth. Look here's a
fiver, go out and buy some Animal
Nitrate for yourself.
Yours, as ever dear boy,
G McCord.

still holds. Surely, if the ConSoc or
any other society believes in the
Fruits of the Western Civilisation,
isn't this the perfect opportunity for

Mistaken Identity
Dear Jonty,
I was very dismayed when I
turned up at the Felix Office to
collect two Metallica videos I had
won in a competition to find that
they had disappeared. After some
investigation I found that your
music Editor Ian 'Poddy' Davies
had already given them away to a
friend.
I find this behaviour extremely
irresponsible, especially since the
person concerned is standing for
Felix Editor, so should show some
reliability and if Felix runs a
competition it has a right to make
sure the prizes are available.
Yours,
K S Rushbrooke, Physics 3.
Lobotomy-o-gram statement
Dear Jonty,
We have felt ourselves obliged to
put pen to paper following a number
of allegations which have been
levelled at C C U and ICU RAGs.
The first of these concerns the so-
called 'Frontal lobotomy-o-grams'.
These were not organised by the
RCS Union as was announced in
your editorial of Felix 957. They
were not advertised as part of the
usual R A G Week japes because
they were not a part of R A G Week,
nor condoned or organised by
R A G . They were carried out by a
small group of individuals, using
the R A G name in an attempt to get
away with a cruel assault.
The allegation in Cat's Eyes that
someone involved in R A G or the
CCUs must take responsibility for
the illegal O-grams is ridiculous.
We are no-more responsible for
these acts than the managers of
British Gas would be for a mugging
by a person masquerading as a gas
meter reader to gain access to
someone's residence. We are very
concerned by the occurrence and
would have done everything in our
power to stop.it, had we known
about it in advance. Further, we
will support fully any victim who
chooses to make a complaint.
The second point needing
clarification concerns the C & G
union Hit-Squad. Members of the
Hit-Squad are given careful
guidelines regarding the placing of
flans on victims (not in the face of
contact lens wearers, place the flan
don't hit people hard etc.). The Hit-
Squad officers themselves also set
rules concerning the maximum
number of hits any one student can
receive to prevent vindictive,
multiple attacks. This year R A G
Week saw an individual receive
more than this maximum number of
hits. This was not due to hit-squad
officers who, rightly, refused to
carry out the extra hits, but down
to a couple of frauds who decided
freelance (and free) hits were the
answer. Donning their own labcoats
and masks, they went out and
continued their attacks on the
unfortunate student.
Both of the above incidents could
have been a lot more serious than
turned out. The victims could have
brought their grievances to college
disciplinary, possibly resulting in
expulsion from college. Worse,
them to attempt to defend it!!
Yours sincerely,
Abdullah.

they could have pressed charges for
assault, with far more serious
consequences. R A G and the CCUs
do their best to keep R A G Week fun
and safe for everyone, however we
cannot be held responsible for
students who decide to take things
into their own hands. These people
are not 'RAG Twats' (Beit Back
957), because they're not Raggies,
just twats, and potentially
dangerous ones. As for vetting
people out of RAG; our policy is to
welcome everyone, and even if we
wanted to we couldn't as, like any
other club or society here, we are
not allowed to turn away any
member of the Union.
