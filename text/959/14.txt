The C l o u d s (Aus) — P e n n y
Century
Somewhere along some merry little
line (playing at powdering my
nose), someone told me that this all-
mixed-gril band are antipodean.
Now I don't wish to slag off our
bastard cousins, though to be sure,
they are our bastard cousins and
should always be regarded as poor
relations (i.e. hide the silver when
they call round, pretend you're not
in and hope they go away without
shouting 'It's Auntie Mona and
Uncle Bruce' for the neighbours to
hear). In fact, if it were not for The
Birthday Party and Prime Minister
Paul Keating (Man of the Year for
that little spot of Queenfeeling), I
could quite happily see all
Australians sentenced to death for
drugs running in Malaysia.
No. You're quite right. This
pointless antagonism towards
colonials isn't fair, and I should be
severely reprimanded for it. After
all, unlike Yanktwats and
Afrikanershagnasties, these people
didn't ask to go. They didn't run off
for the New World when the old
one got a little rough. But lucky
fucking them all the same. This is
going to be a record review, by the
way. I've just got to get Melbourne,
John Farnham, one-dimensional
surf kids and the Earl's Court clone
zone out of my system before
lunchtime, maybe get down to some
swoony harmonies, not a vegimite
sarnie or BBQ'd shrimp in sight. I
reckon I've fdled enough space
Radiohead — P a b l o H o n e y
Ragged, lustful, naked, violent,
vitriolic, diverse, hateful, hurtful,
spineless, cadaverous.
Thorn E Young is the epitomy of
the emotional retard. Loving at the
drop of a hat, hating hisfriends,and
making the most powerful, thought-
provoking and exciting music of the
last eighteen months.
'Pablo Honey' asks questions. It
packs a punch as hard as anything
before it, but with an almost
orchestral articulation of dynamics
as I have ever heard.
The converted will note that there
are six 'new' songs, but will be glad
that the three 'Drill EP' songs have
been re-recorded, with 'Thinking
About You' totally stripped back to
its acoustic skeleton.
Of the unreleased material, 'Blow
Out' is the outstanding track,
surprisingly complex and lyrically
succinct, the album ends with
driving, raging guitars and
thrashing drums enough to tap any
iBffllllil' *^^tIJ1
What? Talented Australians?
Regan's
letter to
Melody
Currie,
there, so I'll return to those
'differentiy sexy' Australians. The
Clouds (Aus) are one of those
glorious universally unprecedented
events, in that they are utterly
sublime. This is like Julianne
infamous 'Starfucker'
Sally Margaret Joy of
Maker, like Edwina
ripping the horrid
Christopher Monckton to pieces
before insulting him, in a televised
debate prior to last year's election.
It is the absolutely marvellous from
the absolutely unexpected. 'Penny
Century' has moments when it
sounds just a tad jangly guitar pop
with Belly/Throwing Muses
pretensions, but the occasional
lurch towards protometal territory
and a simple thing like beautifully
crafted songs dispel any misgivings.
The N . M . E . , one of my favourite
puns and the collective noun for a
bunch of self-publicising Julie
Burchill wannabes (watch 'em use
the word 'smorgasbord'), decided
to give it their critical thumbs down.
Well, 'poo' to their judgement.
Reactionary bastards. There are
some great songs on here; notably
'Hieronymus', 'Immorta',
'Visionary', 'Foxes Wedding'.
Jesus, 'Foxes Wedding' is brilliant,
a St Vitus Dance through a hazy
May day of dimension-spanning
guitar work and sun-drenched
rhythm. Notice I have not stooped
to using 'Ausome'... Head,
shoulders, torso above Inxs,
Midnight Oil, even Rolf Harris, this
is an ebullient and auspicious debut.
I can even forgive them for Rupert
Murdoch. No, scrub that.

G.W. McKenna is another nurse
cast in the mould of a
singer/songwriter from a
Commonwealth principality,
Australia in this case. Despite being
well known there as the frontman
of the now defunct Go Betweens,
he is probably best known in
Europe for supporting Lloyd Cole
last year.
Nevertheless 'Fireboy' is his
second solo slbum, following his
critically accalimed debut of 1991,
'Watershed', 'Fireboy' exhibits a
melange of undercurrents ranging
from the bitter dark pallor of 'The
Pawnbroker', through the
workmanlike 'Whose Side Are You
On?' to the delicate sparseness of
'Signs of Life'. However, for all the
professionalism displayed
throughout the album, there is still
a sneaking lack of real commitment
to the material. Notable exceptions
are 'Bathe (in the water)' and 'The
Dark Side of Town' but these are
islands in a sea of indeterminancy.
Perhaps it needs time to mature
and capture our tastebuds for there
is a quality surrounding it which is
too easy to dismiss. Certainly
McKennan is gifted with a neat if
somewhat pun-oriented lyrical
poise. I mean how can you rhyme
Bonaparte with blown apart without
wincing?
At the end of the day, I think it's
one of those records you end up
borrowing from the library rather
than rushing out to buy.
