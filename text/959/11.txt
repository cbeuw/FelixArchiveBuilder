Third World Poverty
Anti-Poverty Action hits IC next
week beginning on Monday, March
1st. For the first time, IC Third
World First has decided to diversify
its many activities and try
fundraising.
What is Anti-Poverty Action?
This campaign was started by
students in 1979 with the aims of
tackling the root causes of poverty
and injustice. It does this.
1. by directing financial support
to grass roots projects—not just in
the Third World, but also within
Britain—offering immediate help.
2. by education and campaigning
in Britain—offering long term help
i.e. through change in government
aid policies, debt cancellation, fair
trade relations, human rights, and
environmental protection.
What can you do?
You can help by joining the Anti-
Poverty Action scheme. IC Third
World First will provide you with
the Bankers Order Form, you
simply have to fill it in.
We are asking you to commit a
minimum of £1.50 a month to Anti-
Poverty Action. £1.50 to you could
be a drink and a packet of crisps.
To the people you are supporting
it's the opportunity to get basic
educational and medical resources,
and to carry out important
environmental and development
work.
Where will the money go?
Half goes to the educational and
campaigning work of Third World
First (the national organisation not
the IC group). For this you receive
at least three mailings a year—with
newsletters, publications, campaign
updates and information on the
Project which you have chosen to
support.
The other half goes directly to
support a Project of your choice.
The projects are concerned with
people fighting back against
poverty, injustice, and
environmental destruction. Of the
6 or 7 projects which you may
choose to support IC Third World
First will be focusing on one project
in particular, but if you would
rather sponsor another project, then
come along and see us to find out
which projects Third World First
has links with.
Which Project is IC TWF
backing?
We are focusing on a women's
health and literacy project in India
sponsored by Third World First and
Oxfam. This is a community based
project concentrating its efforts on
working with women and children
in the slums of Mysore, a large city
to the south of Bangalore.
There will be a display in the JCR
all week providing a glimpse of the
work of the project. Also a worker
involved with the project will be
coming to speak on Thursday 4th
March.

Where do I sign up?
If you are fortunate enough to live
in Prince's Gardens, then don't call
us we'll call you! On Monday Anti-
Poverty Action leaflets and forms
will be distributed around halls of
residence. On Tuesday evening
canvassers will be calling round to
talk about Anti-Poverty Action and
to collect any forms that have been
filled in.
There will be a stall for others
wanting to sign up in the JCR every
lunchtime from Monday 1st to
Friday 5th March.
Making a difference has never
been so easy, so if you do give a
damn, join Anti-Poverty Action.
The Japanese experience
On Saturday March 6th, The IC
Japan Soceity will be taking part in
Japan Night, organised with the
Japanese Societies of U C L , QMW
and Goldsmith's Colleges. It will
take place at Paul's restaurant on the
4th Floor of the U L U building. It
will be an ideal opportunity for any
non-Japanese student to meet face
to face with the Japanese people and
culture. The festivities begin at
7.00pm, when we will be offering
everyone a taste of both traditional
and Modern Japanese cuisine, from
maki-sushi and miso soup to
chicken kara-ape and Yaki-soba.
Later on there will be a
demonstration given by IC Karate
Club, showing us the way of the
empty hand. This will be followed
by a Kendo (bamboo sword
fighting) demonstration. This is a
sport based on the old sword
fighting techniques of the Samurai,
warriors of the feudal age.
Throughout the evening, we will
have Karaoke available. Literally
translated Karaoke means 'empty
orchestra' and is one of the more
unusual aspects of modern Japan—
Come and see the normally quiet
and reserved Japanese sing to their
hearts' desire or you may even want
to impress your friends with your
vocal talents, not!
We also hope to be able to do a
Japanese style Blind Date, based on
the T V programme 'Neutron!' by
the comic duo 'Tumels'. This has
a totally different style from the
English Blind Date, a major
difference being that there is an
equal male to female ratio. For this
event, the 'contestants' will be
given a badge with their personal
details and allowed to mingle. This
is an opportunity for them to talk
and get to know each other but not
in the biblical sense, yet! At a
specified time, all the females will
line up on the stage facing the men.
Each guy, in turn, then approaches
a girl of his choosing and basically
asks her out. At this point any other
contestant who also likes this girl,
is given the opportunity to woo her.
The girl will then have to decide on
one of them or neither. The
remaining contestants continue and
try and win someone's heart. Any
successful couples will be given a
prize and hopefully romance will
blossom!
The tickets for Japan Night are £4
and are available at the Japan
Society social gatherings at 12pm
on Wednesdays in the ante-room of
the Main Dining Hall (level 1,
Sherfield).
Free Gig
As you may or may not know ICU
Jazz and Rock club has been staging
gigs in the Union Lounge every
other Thursday for some time now
(though this is the first time I've got
round to writing about them). Note!
These gigs are FREE, right under
your nose, and, not wishing to
shatter your preconceptions or
anything, but some of these bands
are rather hot (but Poddy will not
be able to verify this!). This time,
Thursday 4th March, 8.30pm, we
have Hermits Hat (Smiths and
Dylan in a folky blender), some
people who sound like All About
Eve or something and we finally
progress to Tasmanian Devil.
ICSF-The Exorcist
This coming Monday, ICSF is
proud to be showing the single most
infamous horror film ever. The
Exorcist starts with Regan
MacNeil, a young girl with an
apparently undiagnosable illness.
After medical help is found to be
futile, Father Damien Karras, a
Jesuit priest, is called in. So begins
a rollercoaster ride of satanism,
possession, an incredible test of
religious belief and lots and lots of
green vomit. Not for the squeamish,
it sparked a-furious debate on
censorship laws that has lasted right
up until the present day: as a result
of this, it is incredibly difficult to
see it in this country. The film was
based on William Peter Blatty's
bestseller, of which about thirteen
(!) million copies have been sold
worldwide. It was directed by
William Friedkin, who went on to
do The French Connection,
Cruising, The Guardian and
Rampage, and stars veteran actor
Max Von Sydow, who featured in
several Ingmar Bergman films,
Flash Gordon, Never Say Never
Again and the Oscar-winning Pelle
the Conqueror and gave another
great performance for this. It's
notable for its use of Mike
Oldfield's original 'Tubular Bells',
which sold extremely well, partly
as a result and also boasts
extraordinarily good special effects,
including one actor encased in
prosthetic rubber by Dick Smith
(The Godfather and The Hunger)
from the neck up, which
remarkably few people have ever
noticed.
The screaming starts at 6pm in
Chem Eng LT1 on Monday. Entry
is £1 for members whilst
membership is just £3 and includes
the first event entry fee. If you're
likely to throw up, then don't bother
and remember—you have been
warned!
