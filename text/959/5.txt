Use of English
Dear Jonty,
Reading the 'Jehad' article in
Felix 958 has left me exasperated
and upset.
Why?
Because of the frivolous manner
by which this word has been used.
Frivolous is also the word I must
use to describe the manner by which
a member of the Islamic society and
of the Conservative society have
treated a religion held in esteem by
many student members of this
college.
Before passing petty remarks
about matters of global importance
and having them splashed on the
pages of Felix for all to gawk and
gape at, it is advisable to consider
for at least a moment, the feelings
and sentiments of the human beings
who read them.
Long live Democracy.
Long live Respect for
Humankind.
Yours,
Muzaffar Qureshi, Biology.
Library service
Dear Jonty,
Mergers and Aquisitions
It would be interesting to know
whether the IC library has merged
with the Science Museum library,
or has taken it over. Having
recently come into contact with the
Science Museum library I can only
hope that they are being taken over.
Yesterday I went in search of a
PhD thesis which was stocked there
I found the procedure I had to
undergo simply astonishing: fdling
in pink slips of paper and putting
them in designated boxes; waiting
for fifteen mintues which the
librarian whose task it was to fetch
the thesis to appear (and all this time
Violent objection
Dear Jonty,
Beit Back, complaining about the
recent stupid sentence passed on a
fifteen year old rapist said: 'Music
leads to rape, films lead to rape, T V
violence leads to rape—crud!'
Not so, many studies have shown
if you expose people to T V etc
violence there is an increase in their
violent behaviour. (On an aside,
Beit Back recommended castration
for habitual rapists. Well,
remember that capital punishment
never acted as a deterrent, so I'm
not sure i f fear of castration will
deter habitual rapists while they still
have their balls. But a habitual
rapist who is castrated won't rape
again, so I'm for it).
(Back to violence:)
The Editorial argued that
censoring violence was narrow-
minded and short-sighted; that
honest films like Reservoir Dogs (as
opposed to glossy Hollywood hype
films) did not paint an attractive
picture of violence; and proposed
that honest films help us look
honestly at ourselves. True,
Reservoir Dogs makes most of us
realise guiltily that there's a lot of
ugly stuff inside us, and, true,
people like the Editorial writer
don't turn into killers after watching
such movies—but there are people
who gets kicks from watching
violent movies and commit violent
crimes partly due to violent movies,
(to some extent we all have this
streak in us, but control it with
revulsion for violence).
Increasing the realism of violence
in a movie to the level of that in
Reservoir Dogs will turn on the
violent types even more—not make
them stop out of disgust!
The Editorial said 'It is not too
hard to point to evidence of murders
and assaults, aggravated by
glamorisation by Hollywood...'
Part of the huge problem of rising
levels of violent crime over the last
few decades must be due to violent
movies of the last few decades.
Censoring Reservoir Dogs and its
ilk would be part of the cure for the
problem because I think the increase
in violent attitudes caused by
showing such movies is more
harmful to society than the
suppression of freedom of thought
caused by showing them.
I don't think this is narrow-
mindedness or short-sightedness-
it's a long term view trying to
minimise harm done to people.

PJ.
there were two librarians just sitting
there gossiping away); not even
being allowed to stand at the
librarian's desk and leaf through the
thesis until I had signed two pieces
of paper.
I just couldn't believe the
pettiness, the bureaucracy, the
patronising attitude of the staff
there. I did come away with my
thesis—but only after arguing for
several minutes that I could, in fact,
take it out on loan (do libraries not
actually lend books out any more?).
Yours, exasperated with civil-
servant types,
