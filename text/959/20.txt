PRESIDENT Rachel Mountford proposed by Nicky Fox
I am a third year Civil Engineering
student, although most of you will
probably know me better as the ICU
R A G Chair.
The Job
The Union president's job is
basically one of organisation and
representation. Within the Union
the president oversees organisation
of the union and its staff and
officers. Within college, the job
becomes one of representation of
the student body. By sitting on
various college committees the
president ensures that student views
are put across and student
requirements fulfilled.
Me
During my time at college, I have
gained a lot of experience in the
union. I have held several positions
of responsibility, the most notable
being R A G Chair, and have sat on
Council, U F C and the Working
Party on Voluntary Membership.
I've also organised numerous events
over the last two years.
My Ideas
I aim to make this union, the union
you want by:
1. Continuing the work started this
year in opening up the union to the
students.
2. Actively finding out what you
want from us.
3. Working to provide the services
you want.
Other ideas I have include:
1. Creating the post of Catering
Officer to help overcome problems
caused by the new Health and
Safety regulations. This would be
of great use to overseas clubs
wanting to serve food at events, and
at Carnivals.
2. A review of sabbatical posts to
make them more relevant to the
students they serve and more useful
to the clubs and societies they help.
I am standing for Union President
because I think I have the right
attitude and experience to do a good
job for all Mary's and IC students.
I intend to do the job to the best of
my ability and for the benefit of the
students.
PRESIDENT Andrew Wensley proposed by Paul Holmes
My name is Andy Wensley and I
want your vote come election day.
People may recognise me from
working behind the Union bar,
however I have also helped to run
clubs, the financial side of our
Union, aside from being the Dep
Rep for Maths. Due to this
experience I was asked to help
review our Union and recommend
changes.
The job of I C U president
involves liaising within the Union
and College on matters such as
academic affairs, overseas students,
sport and finance; being the public
face of our students to visitors,
whether they be from industry,
charities; coordinating the 'arms' of
our Union, facilitating good
communication and initiating
change.
The greatest change that students
face is Voluntary Membership. If
we do not change now, we will all
lose out, clubs and societies lose
funding, Union services may be
lost. If we start changing now, we
win a Union offering services and
events that we all want.
My experience puts me in good
stead to serve our students and aid
changes needed. I am easy to work
with, however I would not 'toe the
College's line' but would work
where ever possible to further
student interests.
Not promises that can't be kept,
but general policies for next year
i) Greater communication on Union
activities and events around IC and
St. Mary's
ii) To keep bar prices as low as is
possible
iii) To continue investment in the
union building, from the toilet
facilities and Ents lounge to
investigating a permanent 'night
club'
iv) To improve the service of union
outlets, wherever possible and to
develop shop outlets on the
walkway
I am standing because I believe
that I would do a good, unbiased job
and create a Union that serves all
IC and St Mary's students.

DEPUTY PRESIDENT David Goddard proposed by Sarah McCarthy
Election manifestos tend to be all
the same - someone telling you what
they think you want to hear in order
to get your vote. They normally
contain various promises, often
ones which sound good but are
impractical, which they hope you'll
forget after the elections are over.
As manifestos seem to be pretty
obligatory in these elections,
though, here's mine:
I'm currently a third-year physics
student, planning a career in
research. I have done a fair bit over
my time here for the Union, and I
currently work as a Union Steward,
in addition to other positions. I'm
afraid I'm not a committee hack -
I've sat on a number, and would be
lying if I told you that I found them
interesting.
In reality, the people who do
most of the essential running of the
Union are the permanent staff, and
I plan to work with their experience
and knowledge. I believe that
continuity is important, and wish to
build on the successes of the past
and prepare more for the future,
correcting any problems that occur
along the way. This includes
increasing the value for money of
the trading outlets (while still
keeping them financially viable),
increasing the attractiveness of the
Union for all students (including
overseas students, postgraduates
etc.), ensuring fair, and good,
funding for clubs and societies, and
further improving the Union
security arrangements.
I haven't the space here to
elaborate further, so please read my
flyer and feel free to have a chat
with me.
Proposer's bit:
Dave has set himself realistic
targets for next year, and he is one
of the easiest people to get on with
that I have ever met, so I will put
my neck on the line and say he will
DEFINITELY be the best man for
the job.
