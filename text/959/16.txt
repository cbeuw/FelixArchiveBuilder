Entertaining M r S l o a n e
Set completely in the sitting room
of a house straight from the 50s, this
play is a classic comedy from Joe
Orton. With an ostensibly
straightforward plot, it really is
quite amazing how complicated
things can get! M r Sloane is
employed by Eddie, and then lodges
with Eddie's sister, Cathy and
Dadda, their elderly father. A n
interesting development is the
sexual relationship that builds up
between the frumpy, middle-aged
Cathy and the young and vibrant Mr
Sloane, which also involves
mother/son role playing. Twists and
turns in the plot reveal past events,
and show that history has a habit of
repeating itself in the lives of three
of the characters and leads to the
death of the fourth. A completely
unexpected ending gives the play an
extra edge.
A lot of the humour leaps up from
behind and grabs you by the throat,
the jokes being enhanced by
excellent acting from the cast. M r
Sloane was very convincing as a
petulent young man, filling the
stage with his easy going charm and
the occasional outbursts of violent
anger. Cathy showed her loneliness
and her search for love well. She
asks M r Sloane if she disgusts him
in the same breath as saying ' M y
teeth are inthe kitchen in Stergene!'.
As such a classic everyone should
see this play at least once in their
lives and here is an opportunity to
do so. And the male nude photos in
the 'Art' gallery ('pornography'
gallery) may attract a few of you to
this theatre as well.

Truth be known, I'm not much of
a Baroque fan, nor Classical for that
matter. For sure, it is all very
pretty, complete and to the greater
extent, logical and perhaps it's
partly this predictability, coupled
with the lack of outright passion
when compared with such as
Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov or
Bruckner which fails to entice me.
Whatever my preferences, I
sacrificed my love for the
Romantics in the name of art last
Tuesday and trundled off to the
Barbican to witness a concert of
lesser known Handel works,
performed by the English Chamber
Orchestra under the charismatic
leadership of Sir Charles
Mackerras. The Concerto a due cori
D o n P a s q u a l e
Donizetti's comic opera seems fated
to 'For-all-me-family...' treatment.
Two painful productions in as many
months have left the jaunty operetta
reeling from ridicule.
Following in the hobnailed-boot-
prints of the English Touring Opera
the E N O takes the 'amenable'
approach i.e. suits, sunglasses and
Sesame Street subtlety. Don
Pasquale is a soufle-light comedy of
manners embelished with some
enchanting, if predicable tunes.
Here the 'young-lurvers-fool-an-old
duffer'-plot is mercilessly flogged
to flippancy by frenzied eyebrow
No.2 in F is a compilation concerto:
a sort of slightly-less-than-greatest-
hits of Handel (for instance, the
third movement is also known as
'Lift up your heads, O ye gates'
from the Messiah) orchestrated for
strings (with continuo), oboes (and
bassoons) and horns, and resulting
in a delightful array of competitive
displays between the three sections.
Mackerras' strongest attribute has
always been (for me anyway) the
ability to exact the kind of quality
sound from an orchestra in the
manner of say, Karajan or Abaddo,
and it is a delight to both watch and
listen to. On this occasion his jovial
nature coincided with that of the
music, and the musicians were most
evidently enjoying themselves, as
well as putting on a fine display.
The showpiece was the oratorio
which old George Fredrick
composed in 1740, just before he
started work on the Messiah.

waggling. The insubstantial score is
belted and eeked to gratingly
repetitive triviality.
Essentially unsuited to all but the
most intimate and understated of
productions; venue, director
(Andrew Greenwood) and designer
(Joe Varek) have here succeeded in
exposing every flaw of a potentially
amusing and pretty piece. Skilled
delivery from Andrew Shore,
Rosemary Josua and Alan Opie did
little to alleviate the depressing
vulgarity and insensitivity which is
fighteningly prevalent in much of
today's theatre.

around the two Milton poems and
alternates between the 'mirth and
melancholy' throughout, in a series
of recitatives, arias and choruses.
For the choral sections, the Tallis
Chamber Choir was on hand, and
for such a small group, made a
large volume of excellent sound.
Most of the work however, was
carried out by the soloists,
comprising two sopranos and one
each of a tenor and bas s. Although
they both sang beautifully, Yvonne
Kenny had to brush over some
dubious pitching with clever vibrato
and Patrizia Kwella didn't look too
pleased to see us all until it was time
to go home. Thus it was that the
men won on points: David Wilson-

belonged to the players and Sir

If you have ever thought of opera
as something elitist, heavily
dramatic (on the edge of boredom),
hardly understandable and a quite
expensive form of entertainment,
you will certainly change your
opinion after listening to this new
staging of Don Giovanni.
Music Theatre London adds
another dimension to Mozart's
timeless opera. A tale of murder,
lust and betrayal is transported to
a London of portable phones,
Porches and Chinese take-aways.
Don Giovanni is seen here as a
lascivious city slicker with an
enormous sexual appetite.
According to Leporello's (his
guv'nor and minder) personal
organiser, only in London Don
conquered 1003 ladies, not counting
Birmingham, Nottingham,
Brighton...Led by his life motto:
'Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll' he
falls into all sorts of awkard
situations. But there is always
Leporello, to get him out.
Translations (Tony Britten and
Nick Broadhurst, Director as well)
are hilariously funny, and very up-
to-date. Although the stage was
somehow empty (small anyway),
eight singing actors managed to fill
up space with their acting and
singing and to conjure up the party
atmosphere, Don's home, or Sloane
Square.
If you are traditionalist you might
find this approach heretical. If you
are not, Don Giovanni guarantees
an evening of pure entertainment.

It has to be said that I enjoyed the
evening, so maybe I'm on the road
to appreciating music in it's own
right, without it having to conjure
images or stir emotions, which as
Bernstein once stated is the highest
form of musical perception.
Anyway, my pretentiousness is
unimportant; That the E C O are
good - very good - is and it is
definitely worth seeing one of
Europe's elite chamber orchestra's
in action when the chance arises.
This event was the first of a season
at the Barbican for the ECO which
finishes in June. Splash out on one.
