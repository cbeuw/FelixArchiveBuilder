As sabbatical elections reach fever
pitch and you raise your head for
another yawn, why not come down
to the Union and escape the
boredom. Tonight, Atmosphere
will be taking over the Union to
provide a whole night of great
music for you to shake your body
to. There'll be a guest DJ in the
form of the 'marathon man', ROB
B L A K E .
He's manned the decks at many
of the top London clubs such as
Third Base and Club Da Da. Yet
again we're keeping the prices
down to only £1. (Ents card holders
free.) All this and a bar til lam,
disco til 2am (playing everything
under the sun) and a happy hour and
a half from 8.30pm to 10pm (all
drinks reduced by 20%). There will
be no readmission and please
remember to bring student ID.
And Coming Soon...
On Friday 5th March, we'll be
having Emperor Sly playing live in
the Union building. Their club
reggae sounds have received great
acclaim and they'll be accompanied
by some fine dancehall DJ's to
make sure that even in Imperial
Felix 959
College Union, the sun can
sometimes shine. Tickets are
available now from the Union
Office and again are only £2. Buy
early to avoid disappointment.
P.S. The World Music Night last
Friday was a rip-roaring success,
with the event being completely
sold out. Sorry to those people we
had to turn away and thanks to all
those who helped make it a great
night.
