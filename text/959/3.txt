Editorial
Weeks weak
Recently it came to my attention
that new residents in Weeks Hall
have been informed by their
wardens that they should not have
too many people in their rooms.
This is fair enough, order must be
upheld, but as long as you have a
group of friends around to chat until
four in the morning and, provided
they don't make too much noise, no
one really minds.
Wrong. The reason that you are
not allowed to have large numbers
of people in your own room in
Weeks Hall is because you and your
mates could end up crashing
through the floor, and into the room
below. If there are only a few
people present, it is advised that you
all stay away from the centre of the
room to avoid the same effect. The
building was designed badly, with
poor materials, and has been left
structurally unsound with the
Beit
Back
Lies, Damn Lies and Election
Manifestos.
Elsewhere in this edition of Felix
you will find the manifestos from
this years candidates. If anyone can
remember last year's manifestos,
poor you. However none of them
have yet carried out any of their
election promises except Dominic
Wilkinson and Jonty Beavan, who
fulfilled part of theirs.
And this year?
Rachel Mountford (President)
failed to build on Rag's previous
brilliant year. Rag Week came and
went. A new post of catering officer

Rachel, F L E M . Trig
With regards to your letter on page
4:
1) It is not ridiculous that someone
in R A G or the RCS must take
responsibility, since it was due their
inadequate statute that the two
incidents occurred.
2) I feel the need to point out that
the other person that was
lobotomised was none other than
Lorna Mountford, younger sister of
Rachel. This was done for two
reasons: The first is that the three
mentally insufficient lobotomists
knew that she would not mind,
problems never fully corrected.
If this rumour is even remotely
near the truth, every member of the
College Estates division should
immediately commit themselves to
ritual suicide. It is ludicrous that
such a deathtrap be allow to contain
any human being, let alone those
who are meant to be the cream of
our scientific and engineering
talent. That this state of affairs has
gone on for so long is unforgivable,
and should be rectified
immediately.
I cannot deny that this sort of
change costs money, but compared
to the alternative it would be a
pittance. If one such floor-crashing
incident were to occur and the event
hit National Press, we might as well
wind up Imperial College right
there and then. No self-respecting
parent would let their child go to a
University that allows such floor-
hopping antics, neither would a Phd
votes?
Andrew Wensley (President)
always has much more to say for
himself. He is predictably short on
proposals, but yet again there is the
old favourite of cheaper beer prices.
Will he be able to move away from
the shadows of his mentor Chris
Davidson and be his own man?
Highly unlikely.
David Goddard (Deputy
President) lacks the deep
background knowledge to do a good
job for the first 6 months. By which
point its too late to do anything. Yet
again no real proposals, but then
again that is not surprising as he
only wants to be sabbatical to spend
another year drinking with his RCS
buddies.
Hugh Eland (Deputy President)
has the knowledge to do the Union
being the R A G Secretary and hence
would take no legal action. The
second is that they did not want to
give the impression that I was
singled out for an attack.
3) Speaking for Gareth Light: the
term 'RAG Twat' applies directly
to specific Raggies who happen to
be twats, as well as the fake Raggies
who performed the lobotomies.
Sex
In yet another study on human
behaviour, it seems that women
who take the soft approach when
arguing with men, are more likely
to change the minds of their male
sparring partners. The study,
highlighted in last weeks JVew
Scientist (issue 1861), concludes
that women must get their views
student want to spend his thesis
describing how to survive Imperial
College halls. This ridiculous
situation cannot continue for one
moment longer, and for those of
you who live in Weeks, tread
carefully.
Technophobia
This has not been an easy week for
the Print Unit. Taking a casual
glance around the office, it is much
easier to Count those pieces of
equipment which have seen fit to
end the week in a condition that
could be described as 'working'. As
you may have gathered, I am
making excuses; Felix will very
probably be late this week, and you
poor souls could be reading this
issue on Monday as opposed to the
normal early Friday morning
lecture filler. For this, my Lords
and Masters, I can only apologise
and point, ever so 'umbly, to the
pieces of equipment that faithlessly
a good service, but will his pussy-
footing and middle-of-the- road
approach work with College
management?
Maxim Jalil, now the only
Honorary Secretary (Events)
candidate, is best known for his
personal interest in testing
chemicals and his ability to sign his
proposers signature. Vote N E W

Dominic.
Ian Davies (Felix Editor/Print
Unit Manager) otherwise known as
Poddy, Lise Yates and probably a
few other names that we don't know
about, has a rather chequered past.
Controversy surrounded his time as
Music Editor and it was also
revealed on IC Radio this week that
he has faced a college disciplinary
committee.

smiles and 'gentle hand gestures',

women used were not described).
TWAT
Gareth Light, News Ed., has no
grip on reality. Read the letter from
G. McCord. It's very weird that
Gareth writes anonymously in Beit
Back, admits to it the week later,
and then writes a letter another
week later, using a pseudonym, in
which he slags himself off. Beware
of him, he is dangerous.
RAG Cartoon
Mega thanks and praise to the guy
who sent in the R A G cartoon on
page 9. I love it. It's excellent.
PLEASE do another one.

Rebecca Land (Felix Editor/Print
Unit Manager) as Features Editor
this year was responsible for not
including an article that was anti-
religious. This was finally printed
in the Christmas Issue.
The St. Mary's Block Vote.
Each year most candidates spend
the month before the Election at St
Mary's drinking in their bar and
pretending to take an interest in
their bit of Imperial College. The
hypocrisy of this situation is
amazing as once elected they forget
all about them again. The block
vote is decided by the performance
in the hustings and how the voters
are told to vote at the ballot box.
The hypocrisy with which the
election system runs is disgusting.

Red Jeans
I have been asked to write
something about anyone who wears
red jeans (or burgundy for the more
colour conscious among you). To
help me, I interviewed a member of
the college. M r . X (no relation to
Malcolm), as he wishes to be
known, claims that they look vile,
repulsive and nauseating, and worse
when someone is wearing them. He
said 'I don't know what drives
people to buying a pair, they're
hideous!' After removing the
sickened look on his face, he added
'You have admire such people, they
certainly have courage.'
Mr. X is currently taking evening classes in design and fashion.
