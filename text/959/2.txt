Turner turmoil
In a highly controversial move, the
Royal Holloway College has this
week sold its masterpiece, a Turner,
to the John Paul Getty Museum in
California, for £11 million. This
has led to the resignation of one of
the 25 members of the ruling
council of RHC.
The Turner was part of a
collection of 77 paintings
bequeathed to the College by
Thomas Holloway, the College's
founder. The College's action has
been felt to be against the wishes of
the donor. Professor Geoffrey
Alderman, who resigned from the
ruling council in protest said, 'such
sales are a gross and unforgivable
breach of trust'.
As a result, the College looks set
to lose a collection of a thousand
historical books. This hoard
includes 2 Shakespeare folios and
the earliest English printing by
Wynkyn de Worde. M r Christopher
Foley, Managing Director of Lane
Fine Art, decided 12 years ago to
leave the thousand books to the
College in his will. Following the
sale, he has written the RHC out of
his will, leaving the amassed works
to his sons.
Royal Holloway College looks
set to sell another two paintings
which are expected to raise another
£9 million, towards an endowment
fund for the maintenance and
refurbishment of the College. The
principal, Professor Norman Gowar
said, 'Naturally we are sad that we
have had to make the sale at all, but
the cost of preserving Thomas
Holloway's main benefaction left us
with no alternative.'

Chaplin dies at Mary's

his Political Secretary. She resigned
from this post in March 1992, and

The Imperial College Catering
department has lost approximately
£450,000 over the last financial
year it was revealed this week, and
may be related to the financial
misunderstanding that closed
Linstead Hall's bar this Tuesday.
This department has had a history
of financial difficulties and in an
attempt to rectify the situation, M r
Simon Westerman was appointed
Catering manager two years ago.
The service to students, in spite of
this, has remained under constant
criticism, and competition from the
ICU's bar, Da Vinci's, has done
nothing to aid their plight.
Southside bar has reputedly lost in
the region of £25000 so far this
year, some 7 per cent down on their
projected income.
The College's Bar and Catering
Advisory Committee has
complained to ICU about there
being unfair competition due to the
number of 'happy hours' and other
promotions available in the Union
Building which displaces trade from
Southside. Allegations as to the
motives behind the closure of
Linstead Hall's bar earlier this week
being an attempt to curb this
competition appear unfounded. As
Mr Westerman is a licensee of all
the hall bars, the financial errors
that initiated the closure may reflect
on him personally and his future
licence tenability. Mr Westerman is
not in direct control of these bars
and so the closure may have been
justified by caution, if in this case
unfounded.
Gordon Marshall, in overall
control of catering, has been
rumoured to be interested in
offering the college's contract out
to private tenure - possibly to ICU,
but Rodney Eastwood of the Bar
and Catering Advisory Committee
has said that 'There is no intention
of going outside' of the college for
these services. This does not
exclude ICU.
In an interview with Felix, ICU
president Chris Davidson told us
that 'ICU, in it's present form, is
incapable of undertaking such a
huge contract due to it's size. It may
be possible in ten years time, but
certainly not now. Over the issue of
Southside's loss of custom, M r
in that year's General Election, she
was elected M P for the safe
Conservative seat of Newbury, in
place of the retiring Sir Michael
McNair-Wilson. Mrs Chaplin had
a majority of 12,357 over the
Liberal Democrat candidate. No
date has yet been set for the by-
election, which must take place
within the next three months.
The Prime Minister, who said
Mrs Chaplin would have had a
'wonderful career', was saddened
at the loss of 'a dear friend and a
trusted advisor'.

An attempted bicycle theft was
stopped in Imperial College last
Friday 19th February.
The incident took place after a bike
was left next to a van full of Police
behind Central Libraries. On
observing the theft, the police
quickly apprehended the young man
as he was making his escape.
Later, Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of College security, said he was
pleased at this 'active reduction' of
cycle theft in College. M r Briley
added his thanks to all the people
who had cooperated during the
Mountbatten Services at the Royal
Albert Hall last week.
Davidson refused to be drawn
except to say that 'ICU was not at
fault.'
Roger Pownell, Southside's
manager, refused to comment on
the size of the reputed losses, but
did say that 'Southside is
desperately in need of
refurbishment,'and that 'the
recession is also a major factor in
any losses ensued.'
Mr Westerman, who is currently
at home on holiday, was unavailable
for comment. However, Linstead
bar was reopened this Tuesday with
the Catering Department reputedly
'eating their hats' according to one
Linstead Re-app.
