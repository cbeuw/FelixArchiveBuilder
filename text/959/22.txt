FELIX EDITOR Ian Davies proposed by Mark Jackson
'I've known Ian 'Poddy' Davies
since our first year, and have lived
with him for two years. During this
time I have discovered that he
almost never sleeps, a qualification
vital for Felix editing. Life with him
is never boring, always colourful
and full of surprises. I know he will
bring all these attributes to the pages
of Felix, and I believe that there is
no-one better for the job'
Mark 'Trig' Jackson, C&GU
Vice President.
I've been writing for Felix since the
rjegirining of 1991, mosdy under the
pseudonym Lise Yates, and I've
edited the music pages since
December 1991, reviewing,
interviewing and pasting-up. I've
also taken photographs, written
front-page news stories, and almost
FELIX EDITOR
FELIX
News. Summarise national and
international news and
developments in science,
technology and medicine. Run
features explaining the background
to major news items. Cover news
from other colleges and
universities.
Reviews.
Music: feature a wider range of
music. Work with IC Radio,
reviewing playlist records etc.

FELIX EDITOR
Ever since my ingenious escape
from the Biology Department in
November 1991, I have gained
refuge from the Felix office. But
instead of just running around in my
wheel and eating and sleeping, I
have been watching the editor
perform the day to day to task of
compiling Felix. Being editor seems
a fairly easy job, with the added
perk of unlimited caffeine although
I will need plentiful supply of
cheese. This will be my salary:
Cheese and coffee. I require no
money since not many shops accept
cash from a white mouse. Bastards!
Some of you may be thinking that
I have not the required stamina to
put in the long hours needed to
every other task involved in the
production of Felix.
This is what I want to do next
year... v
• A weekly london section,'
detailing the various bargain stores,
cheap eateries, and assorted other
junk in the areas of our lovely city,
spreading out from Kensington and
Paddington to the outer reaches of
London.
• To encourage more input from
clubs and societies, to keep students
informed of the amount of activities
available to them.
• To negotiate for an office in St.
Mary's, equipped to enable students
there to contribute, something that
will never happen while Felix
remains trapped south of Hyde
Park.
• I f it's legal, I'll print it. If it's not,
meetings separately. Make the
section more readable.
Clubs and Societies. Cover special
events. Give more details of sports
results. Advertise future matches.
Union. Highlight more of the
Union's activities, including
Council and other committee
meetings.
Features. Try to get articles about
research within College and more
'arty' features, like short stories.
Delivery. After 1 l?m on a Friday,
there are no copies of Felix left in
most departments. This has been a
long-running problem. Solutions
include a second delivery or
increasing the number printed.
I'll think about it.
• T o try, and I know everyone says
this, to make Felix a more open,
friendly place to be.
If you want to know more, either
come to the hustings, or accost me
in Felix, the bar, or anywhere else
you see me - just look out for my
hat. If not, be sure to use your vote,
and be sure to vote for Ian Davies.
Cheers
PRINT UNIT
The Print Unit is mainly used for
printing Felix, but it is not used to
its full potential. By publicising the
cost of the facilities, it would
become more accessible to students.
Printing for societies is at cost, so
it is cheaper than external
companies. By highlighting this,
money could be saved.
ABOUT ME
I am a third year physicist and have
been involved with Felix for the last
two years. I am Features Editor this
year and was Co-Editor of the last
Handbook and Alternative
Prospectus, so I have experience in
producing publications and working
to deadlines. I can use most
equipment in the Felix Office and
Print Unit. Having worked part-
time for the last three years in a
print shop, I have experience in
design, layout and running a
printing business.
Whiskas the Mouse proposed by Jonty Beavan
successfully produce a quality Felix
every week but let me assure you,
the hours that have been spent on
my wheel were not to kill time. Oh
no, they were toning up my muscles
and preparing me for the job.
Although this years Felix was
good, it could be better. The
M u s i c pages need less photos,
more quality reviews and possibly
a new editor while the Features
that are often long and boring need
to aimed at a more wider audience,
for example, us mice. The What's
On pages look absolutely shite with
the appeal of a mousetrap and badly
need changing. There also needs to
be more Opinion pages with a
limit set on the length of each letter
and the R A G and Union pages
will have to go; a complete waste
of space. The N e w s pages are very
good although Declan Curry will
have to improve if the quality is to
be raised to new heights.
So vote me, Whiskas T. Mouse,
for a year of Felices you'll never
forget!
