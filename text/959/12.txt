Culture Shock-Roots
Culture from the root is a collection
of works by Nigerian artist,
Oladimeji Adisa's vision of life in
images. The works shows a
selection of facts and definite day
to day social, economic and
political aspects of African Culture
and Tradition.
Oladimeji's contemporary works
bridge the gap between the past and
the presentand at the same time
focuses on future expectations. His
style is a mixture of realism and
abstraction that tries to draw upon
the subconscious, with emphasis on
the hands and legs because those
who have neither of them, strive
hard to make their lives meaningful.
His compositions, colours, titles,
images all play a specific function
in bringing an intelligible meanings
and messages about African beliefs,
ideas, values and knowledge.
The works include; The Twin
Mother (Iya Ibeji), Announcement
(Ikede), Under one Umbrella and
Pride of Puberty.
The exhibition is presented by ICU
Third World First, ICU Nigerian
Society and the Imperial College
Consort Gallery and will be held at
the Imperial College Consort
Gallery, South Kensington between
8-22 March 1993 between 10.00am
and 6.00pm Mondays to Fridays
with a private view on Monday 8th
March from 6.30- 8.30 pm.
Pak Soc
FilmSoc-Friends
Today at 5.15pm in the Union
Dining Hall, you are invited to
attend the Pakistan Society Iftar
Dinner. Tickets can be obtained
on the door, so come early to
avoid disappointment. The dinner
shall be followed by the Pakistan
Society Committee elections for
93/94. This is sure to be a fiery
occasion—one not to be missed at
any cost.
Next week, FilmSoc, is proud to
present one of the most popular
films from lastyear's London Film
Festival, Peter's Friends. Starring
most of the 'luvvies' of the British
thespian establishment, directed and
produced by Kenny Branagh, it is
the ultimate exercise in how to
make a movie for all those Thirty
Something and Big Chill junkies.
The extremely witty script, co-
written by Rita Rudner and loaded
with marvellous one-lines, is about
the reunion of six friends from the
Cambridge Footlights. Ten long
and eventful years have passed
since they graduated and headed off
in separate directions to encounter
what life has in store for them.
Peter (Stephen Fry) has frittered
away the promises of his youth and
is unable to commit himself either
professionally or personally. Roger
(Hugh Laurie) and wife Mary
(Imelda Staunton) have been
shattered by a family tragedy.
Maggie (Emma Thompson) has
grown ever more eccentric, sharing
a solitary existence with her cat.
Then, there is Sarah (Alphonsia
Emmanuel) who has been involved
with a series of married men and
whose latest suitor is Brian (Tony
Slatery). Finally, there's Andrew
(Branagh) and his wife Carol
(Rudner) who have both achieved
fame in Hollywood.
These old friends gather at
Peter's house for New Year's Eve
and re-evaluate their lives. Despite
much laughter, there are quarrels,
reconilations, and drama.
The acting from such talent, as
expected, is first rate with Time Out
saying that it reached
'extraordinarily emotional depths'
and Branagh once again proves
himself to be one the best British
director/actors around. The film
also features a soundtrack from the
likes of Queen, Tears for Fears,
Springsteen and Eric Clapton.
Peter's Friends will be shown in
Mech Eng 220 at 7.30pm on
Thursday 4th March. Entry is 90p
for members and £1.90 for non-
members. Remember that
membership is now only £3.50
which includes your first film free.
Finance Election
The Annual General meeting &
Elections for the Finance ociety
were held on Wednesday, 17th Feb.
The ex-chairman arrived a bit late
(20 mins), obviously we all
understand his grief about leaving
his post. The Finance Soc. has had
around 420 members making it the
largest Society at IC, but it was
quite disappointing to see only a
handful of them turn up for the
elections. Last year the elections
were quite successful because of the
buffet after the event. Next year we
shall definitely consider holding a
buffet to improve the attendance.
The meeting started with a talk
given by the out-going chairman
Amer Hasan. He gave the members
a detailed review of how the society
started two years back, how it has
progressed within that period and
the potential it has to go even
further (the speech was well
detailed - he went on for an hour
or so !!). Elections were held after
the Chairman's report. Speeches
were made and questions asked.
This was followed by a very
touching speech given by Maana
Ruia on behalf of the leaving
committee to thank their chairman
for all the things he had done for
them and the society without whom
the society would not be where it
is today. All was over within three
hours resulting in the emergence of
the new chairman, Salman Ali.
We are still looking for committee
members who would like to join our
friendly, lively and hard working
society. Joining the committee
requires no previous experience.
Meetings are held every Tuesday at
1.00pm in the Huxley Building (Rm
410). Members from all
departments are welcome to the
meetings and to join the committee
(first years are more than
welcome). Being a committee
member has a few priveleges and
it's not all work. It's fun and
enjoyable to work for the society.
So see you soon.
