Steward fracas Homophobic Hassle
by D e c l a n Curry
Up to five members of Imperial
College Union staff were assaulted
in a 'near- riot' situation in Beit
Quad last weekend. Imperial
College Security apparently failed
to respond to calls for assistance
from the Stewards. The incident has
provoked another internal review of
Union security.
The series of attacks took place
in a running brawl which developed
early on Saturday morning. Just
after 2.15am, an unidentified young
male was hit a heavy blow to the
rear of his head. His assailant, a
5'4" male, was removed from the
building by Simon Govier, a Union
Steward, and Dominic Wilkinson,
a sabbatical officer. The male, who
was not believed to be a student,
was asked by M r Govier to show
positive identification. He refused
to do so, and mumbled that he was
a guest of the band playing in the
Ents lounge. It is now thought that
the assailant was admitted to the
Union Building after signing the
'paid guest list'.
While the man refused to produce
identification, a group of five others
gathered around M r Govier and Mr
Wilkinson. Scuffles broke out when
the man grabbed M r Govier by the
throat. M r Govier called for
assistance over his security radio,
and he and M r Wilkinson tried to
stop the group from leaving the
Quad.
As the group moved towards the
centre of the Quad, Steven
Newhouse, another Union Steward,
arrived to assist M r Govier. At this
point, M r Govier was restraining
the assailant, who grabbed him by
the hair, kicking and punching him.
M r Govier was also punched by
others among the group. The melee
became increasing violent as it
approached Beit Arch. Rebecca
Land, a Steward, and David
Henderson- Begg, a member of
ICU Bar Staff, arrived as the group
reached the Arch.
Mr Wilkinson closed the gates
between the Arch and Prince
Consort Road, while Miss Land
moved other students and guests
away from the fracas. M r
Newhouse tried to restrain one of
the group attacking M r Govier, and
was himself punched. Another of
the group attempted to strike M r
Newhouse, but he was restrained by
Miss Land, who was physically
threatened. M r Wilkinson moved
away from the gates, which were
then opened. The group escaped
through the open gates. M r
Newhouse's glasses were damaged,
and Mr Govier lost his watch in the
scuffles.
The incident was reported to
Union authorities on Monday
morning. As a result of an internal
security review, the 'paid guest list'
has now been scrapped. This list
allowed friends and guests of the
band, or guests of the Union, to
attend functions for the normal fee.
The current 'signing in list', where
Union members can sign in two
guests, and reciprocal members one
guest, is unaffected. The decision
to scrap the 'paid guest list' was
apparendy suggested by Andy Kerr,
Ents chairman.
College security is also reported
to have tightened security for Friday
nights. Felix understands that two
College security officers will be on
duty in Beit Arch each Friday. Only
one College security officer was on
duty last Friday. Union Stewards
will be briefed on crowd control
later this week by Rick Bilby,

One of the defaced posters found in Selkirk Hall
by D.Spooner a n d G. Light
One of the presidential candidates
in the forthcoming sabbatical
elections is at the centre of
controversy this week. Miss Rachel
Mountford, a third year civil
engineering student and this year's
rag chairperson, claims that a
concerted smear campaign has been
directed against her by unspecified
members of college.
Miss Mountford alleges removal
and defacement of election publicity
posters, with her sexuality being the
specific issue targeted. Independent
witnesses later confirmed that there
was homophobic propaganda on her
posters in Selkirk Hall. Miss
Mountford herself, and other
independent witnesses have also
cited examples in the Royal School
of Mines and Civil Engineering.
Similar handwriting has led to a
single culprit being suspected over
the incidence in Selkirk.
When asked if he thought the
candidate was being victimised,
Dominic Wilkinson, Honorary
Secretary (Events) said there was no
evidence of a deliberate smear
campaign, adding that 'Anybody
found sabotaging or defacing
posters will be dealt with as
appropriate'. M r Andrew Wensley,
Miss Mountford's opponent in the
presidential election, said he had
been aware of the anti-gay lobby,
and that trying to make a political
issue out of sexuality was
'disgraceful'. Miss Mountford was
unavailable for comment.
Further developments in the
sabbatical race concern the
candidates for the position of
Honorary Secretary (Events), with
Charles Leary out of the running.
