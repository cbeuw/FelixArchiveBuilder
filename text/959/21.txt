DEPUTY PRESIDENT Hugh Eland proposed by Daniel Shields
Hugh really wants to be Deputy
President. He recounts his
achievements; starting as a brown-
eyed bush-baby in STOIC, his
meteoric rise through the serried
ranks of the Union and now the final
challenge. This year more than ever
this job demands the competence,
experience and motivation that only
he can provide. From being at his
desk at 9am to coping with the perils
of voluntary membershipâ€”Hugh
would lead from the front. Vote
CCC. Vote Hugh!
The responsibility of the Deputy
President is, first and foremost,
financial. I have been involved in
the creation of the new financial
procedures and could competently
ensure their smooth introduction
and running. Furthermore, I have
experience as a Union Steward and
as Treasurer of a number of
societies. Specifically, I would like
to address the following areas:
Communications:- The
communication between the
students and the Union is
notoriously bad. The 'Reaching
Out' stalls which I organised
initially in the JCR and imminently
at St. Mary's are the first steps to
providing easy access for students
to the facilities.
College day:- The Union has not
yet reacted to the new college
hours; leaving students with wasted
time whilst libraries, labs and the
JCR stalls close during the students
working day. I shall press for better
timetabling and improved services
across the campus.
Accommodation:- With fiascos
such as student accommodation
during the holidays I shall be taking
a firm stand against ill-thought-out
intentions of the College
Accommodation Office.
Voluntary membership:- The
government wants to put an end to
the NUS and in the process they
may well stop funding for many
societies. I shall oppose any
changes that would reduce the
worthwhile activities of the Union
and ensure that all concerned
understand the benefits of Unions
to a broad University education.
HON SEC Max Jalil proposed by Demi Jones
Got a manifesto? Put it to the testo.
Hi there, all you happy free
thinking students of IC. I am Max
Jalil, and I hope to be YOUR
1993/94 Hon-Sec. It has become
increasingly apparent that current
I.C. events although adequate (and
occasionally excellent), are still in
dire need of some added zip,
sparkle and pizazz, and a new minty
taste. I feel that being approachable,
friendly, responsible, committed
and experienced, I am the candidate
to deliver this "bottled Pontin's
atmosphere".
As Honorary Secretary I will be
in a position to decide who gets
which rooms in the Union when,
and for how much. I will use this
power to ensure only the best, most
sought after events are staged.
I believe Ents should be
accountable to you, and in order to
gather your opinions I will make
myself available for questions and
suggestions at least once a week to
try and get some feedback.
I will try to address the problems
with the current Friday night Union
door charge and admission policies,
and investigate the legal difficulties
that CCUs and societies have in
preparing and selling food.
I will revive the CCUs' now
nearly extinct role in staging events,
encouraging joint events with Ents
and Rag to diminish the risks of
making a large loss.
I will encourage wide publicity
for A L L I C U events. I will
publicise at U L U and at all the
London colleges, so that arts
students, science students, students
of every sex and subject, can laugh
and play together in the brave new
world that is Imperial College.
Currently an active Ents kiddy,
BroadSheet editor, second-year
Physicist and habitual patron of the
Union, my latent psychic powers
(those strange voices in my head)
tell me that I definately am the Max
for the job. Cheerio.
