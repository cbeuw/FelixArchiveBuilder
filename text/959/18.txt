After beating Reading 6-3 in the
second round of the U A U the
Imperial ladies team travelled down
to Exeter on Wednesday to play
their quarter finals match. Exeter
were last year's runners-up after
beating our ladies team in the
semi-finals.
This year they again proved
tough opposition and although the
games were close ended up beating
us 6-3.
Big thanks must go to Debbie
Shawcross from St Mary's
badminton team for filling in at the
last moment for one of our players
who was unavailable. The other
team members were Madhu
Bhabuta, Jennifer Lau, Barbara
Spence, Uta Boltze and Wendy
Yates.
Unfortunately the men's first
team met their match in the second
round then they played Nottingham
at home. Nottingham proved first
class opposition and despite a brave
battle the men's team were
overpowered 9-0. The men's team
were Captain Caveman, Martina,
Bill and Ben the headband men, the
beast man and Rudolph, otherwise
known as Alan Craw, Martin
Sevenoaks, Jinyee Lim, Chai Lai
Tan, Richard Langford and Steven
Trussell.
IC Football
The final games of the first round
group games took place this week,
with all to play for. With the
competition for places at an
optimum the games were played at
a thrilling pace and were full
blooded.
Last Thursday saw a thrilling
game between the Sri-Lanka and
Chinese team. It was close all the
way to the end, with the equaliser
being scored by the Chinese team
with 15 seconds left. Friday evening
saw another good performance by
the Anti-Apartheid team beating a
good Islamic team 12-5. The Anti-
Apartheid team look very strong,
especially when playing their
passing game, and are led well by

Cup semi-finals only mean one
thing: you either win or you lose;
either the stirring vision of the 'twin
towers' or the slow team back from
defeat. Fortunately our train came
in last week, today we were
dreaming of the hallowed (astro)
turf and the roar of 8 (thousand)
fans. Our rare early one-nil lead
was soon knocked down through a
rare defensive debacle. We later
poked our heads above the
quagmire long enough to fire a short
corner past the sprawled goalie and
began our birthright. The second
half was a limp affair but we
dominated territorially at least
through Samin and his amazing
sword of Dobber. It ended 3-1, see
you in the final.
If anyone wants to come along
and have numerous games of
badminston at very little cost then
new members of any standard are
welcome at club nights on Mondays
and Fridays in the Great Hall or
Volleyball Court at 7.30pm.
Finally the A G M will be held on
Tuesday 2nd March at 1.00pm in
the JCR to elect next year's
committee.

On Monday the Lebanese team
qualified for the quarter finals by
default, by being awarded a 10-0
win due to the Malaysian team not
turning up. Also on Monday the
Pakistani team topped group 1 with
their third successive win. This
week they beat Chem Soc 11-3 with
their leading goal scorer getting
another hat full. Wednesday
evening saw the Hellenic team beat
the Indian team 11-6 with a
numerous number of goals scored
by Tellis (IC FC 1st Captain). On
the same night a hard fought game
saw the Cypriot team beat the Sikh
team in a hard fought and
aggressive game by 11-6. The

Trios League
The trios league recently reached its
climax when Wibble (M Bell, M
Turner and H Al-Qassab) clinched
the title in a tense finish by just 2
points from Hedgehog II (T Lee M
Lodero and S Chen) Going into the
last week any of the top three teams
could clinch the title and it was
delicately poised with 1st v 3rd and
2nd v 4th. Both leading teams
scraped 6-2 victories. Hedgehog
coming back well after being
hammered by the first game.
Despite losing to Wibble, Swan
Vesta (R Tay, D Wilkins and J
Joyce) held onto third place.
Wibble took the high handicap
game with 449 whilst Hedgehog
took the high handicap series with
1816. Both scratch awards go to 5th
place Turkeys (P Sharpe, P West
nd L Brockless) who bowled a new
club record 557 game and 1551
series.
We now move on to the annual
Spring Doubles Tournament, to be
followed by the quest for club
champion. Finally the season
finishes with the inter C C U
tournament in which RCS are
confident of removing the trophy
from the vice like grip of C&G. The
big question this year is will Mines
manage to field a full team?
Cypriot's topped group 2 with their
unbeaten record.
The quarter-finals, semi-finals
and final games will all be staged
next week (beginning 1.3.93) at the
times stated below. Teams who
have qualified for the later stages
will be notified to when they will
be playing next week. They should
make careful note of the times
below.
The winners of the tournament
will be presented with the winning
trophy, medals and cash prize on
International Night on Friday 5th
March. The runners-up will also
receive medals and a cash prize on
the same evening.

First team report
The firsts recently defeated Brunei
University 8-2 in the first running
of the Phil Wren Memorial Trophy.
The match was a high scoring
one, which saw the C team break
the club record high game
(previously equalled by this year's
A team). The C team registered a
3-1 win, thanks mainly due to an
inspired (or was that just a fluke?)
series by Ian Dogett (535) and Dave
Wilkins (508, with a 205 game)
providing the major contributions in
an otherwise below par
performance.
The A team came back from
losing the first game to register a
3-1 win. Siang-Yong Lim (554),
Sam Chen (511, including a 200
game) and Melvin Curran (490, in
hitting a 444 series).
The ladies held on to get a 2-2
draw, although had Rachael Tay
managed a strike with her last ball,
they could have won the match
2.5-1.5. In a very low scoring
contest it is only worth mentioning
that only Rachael managed to bowl
over 400, hitting a 444 series.
Overall a very satisfying victory,
with the team pinfall of 7229 very
respectable by current student
standards (although we demolished
this total in the Quarters against
Scummers!).
