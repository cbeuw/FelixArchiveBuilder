Ryback (Steven Seagal) is an ex-
SEAL (SAS equivalent), working
as the cook on board the USS
Missouri, a soon to be
decommissioned ship manned with
only a skeleton crew. The ship is
hijacked by two psychotics - the
commander of the ship itself and
another SEAL guy, who aim to
steal the ships nuclear arsenal and
threaten all-out nuclear war. So
Ryback, aided by his kitchen
assistants, fights back.
This is your prototype big budget,
feel good, mind-numbing
entertainment movie. It has all the
necessary and sufficient ingredients
- the martial-arts expert good guy
with a sense of humour and a firm
chin who's acting talent consists of
Roger Moore style eyebrow
wiggling coupled with a impressive
sneer, the bit of skirt in the form of
Erika Eleniak playing a Playboy
centrefold who stunningly
overcomes her fear of weaponry
(fhaar, fhaar) to save Ryback's life,
and the wavering pyschopath
(Tommy Lee Jones) who leaves you
in no doubt he's the baddie. Add
lots of large explosions, plenty of
machine-gun fire, a good bloody
unarmed combat scene and a tense,
melodramatic finale, et voila, a
guaranteed box office success.

Being a musical revue this was a
collection of songs and therefore the
poor plot commonly associated with
Broadway musicals was thankfully
absent.

Under Siege.
The songs in the first half had the
common theme of love with all its
trials and tribulations. It involved
some exceedingly humourous and
acute observations especially those
on the true relations of couples in,
'I don't believe it'. After the
interval the show became a little
tedious, some songs were obscure
and the humour began to fail. The
cast however did an exceedingly
good job, complete with actions and

all, one could have been on
Broadway. This small theatre made
their roles even more demanding
and with only three of them, there
was no room for mistakes. It was
a well performed piece and if
musicals are your scene—well go
and see it.

T h e Invisible M a n
The Invisible Man is a comedy, a
magic show and a musical - all in
one. It is about the naive inhabitants
of a small English village in the year
of 1904. Everything is peaceful,
until, on a dark, winter's night, a
mysterious man, covered from head
to toe in clothes and bandages,
arrives. He claims to have had a
serious accident, and this seems to
satisfy the villagers until a series of
burglaries occur. In a spectacular
scene, which would impress even
the great Paul Daniels, the vicar
witnesses an attempted robbery of
his week's collection by an unseen
spirit. The plot, thankfully not too
simple, unfolds when the stranger,
in yet another spectacular scene,
unveils his bandages.
The show is written and directed
by Ken Hill who has a string of
impressive productions behind him.
Paul Kieve designed the illusions
which are, on the whole, quite
superb. The acting is brilliant,«nd
especially good were Caroline Bliss
(as the School Mistress), Brian
Murphy (who starred in George and
Mildred), and Philip Newman.
The show starts off much like a
pantomime and without much of an
involved storyline. Via brilliant
special effects, it progresses into a
more seious and complex world of
greed, violence and obsession with
power.
There seemed to be mixed
feelings about the show among the
audience. "The best show in
London," said one man, who was
scornfully looked upon by another.
But for me - better than a kick in
the teeth.
