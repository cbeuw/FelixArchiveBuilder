This is h
o
w you will benefit
You make a start - at a lower cost than you can ever find again - towards planning your financial
future and prosperity.
At the appropriate time the plan can be used in conjunction with a building society for buying
your own home.
Your investment can follow a pattern of your own selection, because your money can be linked
either to the equity market, or to the profits of a leading Insurance Company. (Needless to say,
these schemes have the background security of Life Assurance protection).
You will have access always to a free Advisory Service, to meet your problems of financial
planning. Suitably, the management is provided by a team of University Graduates and qualified
Insurance specialists - so we know exactly how to advise you. Our experience comes from hand-
ling the affairs of many thousands of students and Graduates over a great many years.
•^r In fact one of the schemes for students has been described in the City as "an apparent miracle"
because it actually invests on your behalf 30% more every year than your own contribution.
This five star rating is available to students through E. Harrison Limited, the first independent
brokers to offer a specialised student insurance service. Many thousands of students and Grad-
uates are now using this service and the total benefits are approaching £50,000,000. Thats right
FIFTY MILLION POUNDS,
The future benefits are impressive: the present cost as low as possible.
