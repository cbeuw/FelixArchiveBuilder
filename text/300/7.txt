NUS and grants MORE LEG
Does the student grant
system need changing? To
answer this question we
must throw light on some of
the often forgotten issues in-
volved, bearing in mind the
present system has evolved
during several ages of educa-
tional thought and hence
needs rationalising.
The opinion that a student
has been provided with a
university education out of
the goodness of society's
heart is we believe the first
and most basic misconcep-
tion. This country provides
us with an education be-
cause it requires us to be
educated in order to fulfill
the needs of society, and
therefore we owe nothing to
society.
Bearing this in mind
when we consider a student's
standard of living, we should
not consider it in the con-
text of a student's life — one
of books, tatty digs, basic
food and spending money
but in comparison with the
expectations of a person of
simular age in other E M -
PLOYMENT.
The only consideration
opposing this was voiced by
a single IC student a few
days ago in saying what
responsibility does a student
have to society, and is the
system we live in ie. self sup-
porting capitalism. I would
say the individual is helpless
but to accept society's
handouts.
Having decided the stu-
dent's grant system should
be reviewed NUS has arrived
with a number of priorities
at revisions.
(1) The removal of the
discretionary grant system
under which only students
on degree equivalent courses
are entitled to a grant by
right. Thus HND students
are awarded grants at the
whim of their LEA. Thus
great discrepancies arise in
the size of the award from
one L E A to another and
within an LEA.
hall selection
—a personal view by Steve^Swailes
With some interest being
shown amongst both students
and administration bureau-
cracies in the revision of Hall
selection procedures, it is
time for a careful look at the
criteria upon which this
selection is based.
Firstly let us consider the
situation as it stands. Fresh-
ers appear as if by Divine
Decree from deep within the
bowels of the Departments;
places are filled by the Un-
ion, wardens, and finally
reapplicants and new 2nd
year, 3rd year and PG appli-
cants by courtesy of the
much loved Hall committees.
It is in these Hall committee
allocated places that justice
is least seen to be done. On
what criteria are these
places awarded, and what
right have the Hall commit-
tees to exercise those cri-
teria?
Generally speaking, places
are awarded by the commit-
tees on the basis of potential
usefulness of applicants to
the Hall, or, in the case of
re-applicants, what they did
for the Hall whilst in resi-
dence. This amounts to little
less than social apartheid.
What right has a small group
of Hall residents — in one
case, Weeks, elected by them-
selves in advance of their
term of office — to say that
over-socialised extroverts
who function in a very nar-
row sphere of influence are
more entitled to a place in
Hall than introverts or
people whose sphere is wider
than the purely local? The
only criteria for a place in
Hall should be membership
of Imperial College and the
human race — perhaps an
impossible combination. Of
course a cheap room, hot
water, showers, baths, ined-
ible food and ridiculous rules
should be available to all
members of the College re-
gardless of personality.
Starting with this criterion
and the principle that every
undergraduate should have
the offer of one year in Hall,
there are several fields where
radical pruning would not
come amiss. Firstly are re-
admissions necessary at all?
The tired old answer which
staggers forth traditionally is
that re-admissions are neces-
sary to preserve the continu-
ity of Hall life, or, if you
like, the sterility of Hall life.
Year in, year out, the same
ghastly parties and coffee
swilling sessions, and the
same cant about overnight
guests — without any re-
admissions a few new ideas
might well up out of the
great stagnant pool of fes-
tering old thought that exists
at present.
Then the Union places.
(2) The concurrent aboli-
tion of the means test with
income tax allowances and
family allowances for stu-
dents. And while the bureau-
cratic changes required im-
plementing this are con-
sidered, NUS suggest a com-
plete revision of the scales
on which the parental means
are judged.
The reasons for NUS giv-
ing this measure a high
priority are involved in the
difficulties in family relation-
ships and finances coursed
by the present system quite
apart from the fact that a
student cannot possibly exist
on a grant unless made up
to the full figure which many
parents have to ask their
sons and daughters to do.
(3) A restoration of the
real value of the grant com-
pared with an estimation of
a students cost of living
index increase since 1962. By
increasing the rate of the
maximum mandatory grant
accordingly.
The NUS has set up a pub-
licity campaign to try and
influence the government on
a national scale and the
LEAs on the local (college
and area) scale, as well as
obtaining the sympathy of
the public in general.
The sign finance of the
local level of influence is
far greater than is usual due
to the integral part played
by the L E A in supplying
grants, some of the finance
for which comes from the
local rates.
How does IC come into this
campaign? Despite the lack of
volunteers coming forward at
the previous union meeting, as
organising committee for the
campaign has been set up and
are in close liaison with the
USK grants committee.
As you should have noticed
a certain number of leaflets
and posters have been circul-
ated in college. On Tuesday a
write-in to MPs was held and
it is hoped to hold several more
in the College block JCR. It is
also expected that a sizeable
press report on grants will ap-
pear in this week's Kensington
Post due to the work of the
USK committee.
It is intended that a petition
showing the support of acade-
mic staff will be handed to
Mrs. Thatcher in a few days
time.
The other main activity is not
We hope going to consist of put-
ting our views over at local
clubs such as the constitual
Conservative party, Rotarys and
round tables in the hope that
we will be able to secure the
sympathy of influential citizens
or alternatively that these local
branches may pass sympathetic
motions to be communicated to
their regional or national offices.
In this campaign we obviously
need active support and any-
body interested in helping
should contact Greg Burland
(Physics 1) or via the Union
Office.
It would be helpful for future
grants campaigns if you were
to fill in the relevant question-
naire about to be circulated by
the welfare committee.
Dear Sir,
I Would like to complain about the low standard, cheap
and smutty photographs that have recently appeared in
FELIX (e.g. above).
Your faithfully,

Why the performing clowns
of the Constituent College
Union should have an auto-
matic place in Hall defeats
all logical reasoning — their
only qualifications for the
posts appear to be over-
strong lungs and undersized
brains.
Finally, the social implica-
tions of Freshers in Hall
must be considered. A first
year in Hall introduces
Freshers more directly and
positively to College life,
other students, and them-
selves, than a year spent in
distant suburbia. 50% of
residents should be Fresh-
ers.
The time has come to radi-
cally rethink the whole selec-
tion procedure for Halls of
Residence on both moral and
practical grounds — most of
our lives are controlled by
others already — they claim
to speak for the People —
you are a Person, and only
you can speak for YOU.
