Institute trounce IC
On Sunday, 28th Febru-
ary, at Harlington, an Im-
perial College X I composed
mainly of second, third and
fourth teamers, was well
beaten by a bang-on form
Institute X I .
Before the match, there
was a small presentation, in
which the I.F. team grate-
fully received a pair of un-
derpants, signed by the entire
I.C. team. I.F. won the toss,
and decided to play down-
hill, with the wind, and with
TECHNICAL HITCH
This one hitch was around
1800 miles long. Three stu-
dents from Physics 2, left

vey, Joan Emmison, Mal-
colm Freedman left last
Thursday to set up a record
for hitch-hiking the round
trip: London-John O'Groats-
Lands End-London.
At the same time they will
have attempted to break the
present record for the
straight through run. John

their backs to the sun.
Owing a little to adverse
playing conditions, and a
hell of a lot more to at-
trocious refereeing by Kev
Eustace, I.C. were really up
against it in the first half.
The tactical plan of tying the
full backs together with rope
did not seem to be paying
off, and defensive errors, of a
kind not often seen at I.C.,
lead to the first six goals.
The majority of these goals
came from swift piercing at-
tacks by I.F. which split the
I.C. defence several times.
After the fourth goal, the
tackling at the back became
desperate with Gordon Sut-
cliffe attempting many
crunching tackles which just
failed to come off. Just be-
fore half time Brooks was
warned by the referee to stop
arguing. The I.C. attack were
having no luck either at the
end against a strong tackling
I.F. defence. Attacks were
proving useless against a
quick marking defence, and
unorthodox tactics were be-
ing brought into play. A
"four men in a line" drib-
bling formation was merci-
lessly scythed down by an
I.F. defence seemingly in-
tent on taking souvenirs
(knee-caps, ankle-bones, etc.)
A pyramid of I.C. forwards
ended in near disaster when
it was attacked from all sides
by a fierce I.F. defence.

IMPERIAL MASCOT RAID
After many fruitless and
frustrating hours of hunting,
throughout London and the
home counties, our brave and
valiant Mascot Committee
finally achieved their due reward
when, in the persons of 'Jonky',
'Jem', 'Steve', 'Les' and 'Wild
Bill', very early In the morning
of Friday, 19th February, they
'acquired' Imperial College's mas-
cot—a three foot long, fully
operational maxi-micrometer!
Cub is now able to reveal how
the fearless five executed their
daring plan.
Two weeks before the raid
took place, Steve Parkinson, in
his official capacity as EngSoc
Chairman, was invited to attend
the Annual Dinner of the
Imperial College Engineering
Society, and while there he took
the opportunity of finding out as
much as possible about the
location, the alarm systems and
the fixings of the I.C. Mascot.
Notice the victorious
attitude of Q M C ' s
newspaper, C u b , upon
the recent acquisition of
Jonky, Steve, Les and Jem with the
Wild Bill for the non inclusion
inadvertently mislaid.

of his photograph but it was

rendezvous with Jem Newton.

abortive! I C , what are
you doing?
Pike could not fool the alert
backs either, and the for-
ward line failed to score in
the first half.
Half-time I.F. 6 I.C. 0
The second half was again
controlled by the I.F. team,
their domination of midfield
being an important factor.
Time and time again the I.C.
defence were ripped apart
and but for courageous goal-
keeping by Kev Stovell must
surely have conceded more
goals. Eventually, the I.C.
attack cashed in on two
rare defensive lapses by I.F.
and scored two consolation
goals against Mick Whitam,
who had sportingly agreed
to play for I.F. in goal.
Brooks was cautioned yet
again by the referee for argu-
ing against a questionable
penalty decision. However,
the penalty was given and
Helena Lacey cooly slammed
the ball into the net from
three yards while the goal-
keeper wasn't looking. The
game was marred towards
the end by a disgraceful
tackle, by one of the I.C.
backs, on Mabel Vassal,
which missed her by a good
two yards, but still caused
an ankle injury. Several im-
mediate curses were sugges-
ted by the I.C. team, among
them being 'just gve it a
rub' and 'have it off (ampu-
tation).
The eventual score was
11-2 to the girls, who, at the
end rather unsportingly, re-
fused to swop jerseys, much
to the disappointment of the
I.C. team.
Scorers were I.F. Helena
Lacey (4), Pauline Archer
(2), Sue Marrrot (2), Sheryl
Clarke (2), and Louise
Shackley (1). I.C. Bill Pike
(1), Dave Green (1).
