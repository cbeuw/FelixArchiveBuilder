. . . it is already well known that the refectory is running
at a considerable loss — £3,451 last year, and a similar
amount this year, and that the Governors could not continue
to meet this loss . . .
May 5 1950
. . . The Royal College of Science featured in front page
news in the 'Evening Standard' on Monday, 6th November.
On Sunday evening, about 9.0 o'clock, a 31-year-old seaman
invaded a basement research laboratory of the Geophysics
department and, wrenching the legs off a heavy table, started
to smash up the equipment . . .
November 17 1950
Sir,
We would Ike to deprecate the action which took place
this morning, resulting in the debagging of a "Daily Worker"
salesman . . .

SOUTH KEN LINK-UP?
For some time now there has been increasing aggravation
for some sort of interchange of ideas between the sundry
facilities housed in our neighbourhood, and much support
has been promised to those who have raised their voices.
At last a tentative but concrete step has been taken in this
direction, and a Committee, supported wholeheartedly by the
Rector, and consisting of the Presidents and "Social Secret-
aries" of R.C.S., R.C.A., and R.C.M. has been set up.

. . . class Z students may have to do their fifteen days service
with the Army before the June examinations . . .
9 February 1951
. . . the Union Bar prices will remain as at present (draught
mild 1/3, bitter 1/5, per pint) . . .
18 May 1951
. . . The mention of hops reminds me that I intended to
write a few words about them. These are Saturday night
affairs (for want of a better word) where you pay a nominal
two shillings and then shoulder the woman of your choice
through a quickstep. Many societies held hops last year . . .

Was the college to re-affiliate with with N.U.S.? After an
hour of discussion in which no real case was put up against
the motion it was defeated after a re-count by 288 to 252 . . .
19 March 1956
UNION OPENING?
As non-freshers are already aware, the union is awaiting
eagerly the opening of new premises in prince consort Road
. . . The College has acquired three sides of Princes Gardens.
Demolition of the existing structures of the east and south
sides should begin shortly and it is hoped that accommoda-
tion for 450 students will be ready in three years' time. . . .
8 October 1956
This week the third of the model study-bedrooms erected
in no. 14 Princes Gardens by Richard Sheppard and Partners
was finished. The room embodies several interesting ideas,
but comparison with the first two reveals some economies
that may not find favour with students.
The room measures approximately 14ft. 6in. by 8ft. 6in.
A sliding window occupies one end, with an imitation marble
slab over a heater forming a window seat . . .
14 February 1958
. . . Speculation on the fate of the Colcutt tower, crowning
glory of the shortly-to-be-lamented Imperial Institute, has
recently been revived as a result of the publication of the
estimated cost of keeping it, said to be £250,000 . . .
17 January 1958
The original statue of a bashful nude in the centre of
Princes Gardens has been removed, and in its place is a
large stone urn that is said to have come from the relcs of
the 1851 exhibition . . .
2 May 1958
WEEKS H A L L OPENED
. . . most of the study bedrooms have a coloured wall, and
these are intended to be seen as a bright motley from the
street. Unfortunately none but the dark brown is rich enough
to be successful, and it is possible to miss this feature alto-
gether . . .
October 16 1959
The Imperial College union decided by a majority of 16
votes to join the National Union of Students forthwith at
a debate last Thursday. In a historic secret ballot the motion
was carried by 405 votes to 389 with 27 abstentions.
13 February 1962
QUORATE UNION MEETING !
600 turn up.
November 21 1962
. . . a barrage of criticism has been directed at Mr. Mooney
this term (as in every term) via the Southside suggestion
book. When interviewed by Felix, however, the refectories
manager had a reply to nearly all his critics. Suggestions do
not go unheeded and modifications are not impossible. . .

UNIVERSITY IN SOUTH KEN
Robbins says OK.
30 October 1963
. . . Imperial College is to have its own I B M 7090 com-
puter . . . 13 May 1964
. . . On turning right into the concert hall you were con-
fronted by the sight of the Phil Jennings Band, Whose mem-
bers outnumbered the audience. No doubt "Tea for Two"
and "Small Hotel" went down a bomb at the 1934 Freshers'
Hop, but tastes change . . .
21 October 1964
SOUTHSIDE TO BE CLOSED ?
The bad relations born last session between the students
of Southside and the inhabitants of Princes Gate Mews have
worsened a stage further in recent months. Should complaints
from the Mews residents warrant, Westminster City Council
would be pressured into asking for a court injunction.
4 November 1964
. . . Guilds, R.C.S., and Mines are to make a joint effort to
manufacture a five-foot long working micrometer. " As this
is university it will be graduated in degrees." Referring to his
copy of Felix 210 for facts Nigel Gravette proposed at
December 3rd's Union meeting, that "As I.C. is a predomin-
antly male college it is only appropriate that it should have
a screw gauge as its mascot . . . "

Southside nearing completion.
