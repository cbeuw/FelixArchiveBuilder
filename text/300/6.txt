ELTON JOHN in concert 24th February
To one of the largest audi-
ences seen in the Great Hall,
Elton John rocked his way
through several really great
numbers. Yet he didn't ar-
rive on stage until about
twenty to eleven when some
of the audience must have
been worried about his ap-
pearance. Yet appear he did,
to a really warm reception
for both himself and his first,
'Your Song.' Up until then,
the crowd in the Great Hall
had been treated to first
Urban Clearway, and later
John's backing group Hook-
foot.
Urban Clearway lacked a
few things, one of them ta-
lent. And they might have
been more at home in one of
Ent's 'Saturday night hops.'
Still, perhaps this is unfair,
the audience did thank the
group with reasonable ap-
plause. And so on to Hook-
foot who gave a performance
which clearly showed more
talent and experience. Be-
tween them, they showed not
so much versatility as actual
technique and coordination;
their music was hard and
had a likeable amount of
rock influence. They gained
a big response and only the
fact that Elton John fol-
lowed, limited the several
shouts of 'more.'
The Concert's one fault
was one that must limit many
such 'technical' events. Time
b e t w e e n performances
dragged as equipment, not
very extensive in this case,
was transferred to and from
backstage. It seems a pity
that these interruptions'
must happen, concerts lose
some continuity and atmos-
phere because of them.
Hence the delayed appear-
ance of Elton John on stage.
Yet his performance made
up for any other shortcom-
ings, with a range of songs
and styles, one or two from
the LP 'Tumbleweed Con-
nection.' Elton John has two
rare qualities; one his voice
and two, his way of jump-
ing around the piano while
still banging out on the
keys. With artists like this
guy. Ents can't go wrong!
FILMS
M i c k J a g g e r t o
D . H . L a w r e n c e
At present showing at the
Odeon in Kensington are
'Sons and Lovers' and "The
Virgin and the Gipsy', either
one of these films would be
well worth spending your
50p on seeing, and in my
opinion this double billing
is not to be missed.
'Sons and.Lovers'—which
is in Black and White, is
about a boy from a mining
family in Nottingham who
wishes to leave and go to
London, but is prevented
from doing so by his love
for his mother. He is deep-
ly affected by the way that
the love between his father
and his mother had decayed,
and is determined that his
life should not be wasted in
a similar manner.
Although this film is in
Black and White, the camera
work is truly excellent in
every way; however, I was
slightly irritated by the way
some of the 'Nottingham'
people spoke with pseudo-
Yorkshire accents.
The main film of the pro-
gramme was Christopher
Miles' 'The Virgin and the
Gipsy', based on the book
by D. H . Lawrence. The
plot was fairly typical of
Lawrence, about two girls,
Yvette and Lucille, who re-
turn to live in a quiet vil-
lage rectory having just
finished their schooling in
France, and how particular-
ly Yvette, played by Joanna
Shimkus, fails to settle into
the triviality of vicarage life.
When Yvette meets 'the
Gipsy', played by Franco
Nero, she finds herself drawn
almost magnetically towards
him. The Gipsy is portrayed
as a very strong, virile, silent
almost rock-like character—
in marked contrast to
Yvette's father, the Vicar.
The rest of the film leads up
to the inevitable love scene—
which comes about in a
most improbably convenient
manner, making the ending of
the film very sudden.
The opening few scenes in-
troduce all the main charac-
ters in great detail, I par-
ticularly liked the way
'Granny' (Fay Compton)
was portrayed, her ability to
start trouble and then to be-
come stone deaf was really
well done. The first 'Dinner
Scene' clearly showed the
stresses which existed within
the family group. Again
the photography in this film
was very good, I particularly
liked the opening shots of
the church and the water-
fall. D. Howard
'Performance' (Warner,
West End) is the Mick Jag-
ger film that was nearly
never released, according to
reports, due to Jagger's ac-
cent being nearly incompre-
hensible, but after complete-
ly re-recording the sound-
track it has been finally re-
leased. 'Performance' was
made earlier than 'Ned Kel-
ly', which was slated by both
the criticis and Mick Jagger
himself (I personally rather
enjoyed 'Ned Kelly', a skill-
fully made film). 'Perform-
ance' is totally different to
'Ned Kelly'. Jagger plays
Turner—a brooding, retired
pop-singer, who shelters
James Fox, the young thug
on the run from his gang.
Turner shelters James Fox
only reluctantly, perhaps be-
cause Turner can see the
great gap between his own
and Fox's world.
At the beginning of this
relationship the two stay
separate until Fox needs Tur-
ner to take a passport photo-
graph for him, and then Tur-
ner drugs Fox and a rela-
tionship develops on the
realisation that they have
more in common than was
at first obvious.
When Fox recovers from
the drugs he realises he Is
late in 'phoning a friend
about his passport, the gang
find out where he is and
they come to Turner's house
to get Fox. Fox kills Turner
and is then taken to the boss'
car, the car drives off and it
is clearly Turner in the car.
The apparent change in
identity is again to empha-
sise the closeness of the re-
lationship and their deaths
finally destroy this relation-
ship.
Personally, I thought that
this was a very excellent
film. The photography is al-
most subjective at times.
The acting from James Fox
is superb, his portrayal of
the young thug was quite ter-
rifying; Mick Jagger's Tur-
ner is excellent, which in a
way surprised me.
Overall this is probably
one of the most interesting
films on release at the
moment.

RECORDS
One British songwriter/singer who tends to be completely
ignored due to lack of publicity is Nick Drake, whose second
LP "Bryter Layter" (Island 9134) has just appeared, des-
pite a promise of Autumn '70 release on the cover of the
sampler album "Bumpers." His first record, "Five Leaves
Left," contained work of a very high standard, but received
no acclaim whatsoever. The new album is equally good, re-
taining the same atmosphere of sitting-drinking-coffee-watch-
ing-the-world-through-the-window which is well known to
many of us. Perhaps a large part of one's musical taste con-
sists of identification with the performer or writer, and the
music of Nick Drake is the nearest I have found to my
particular outlook on life.
Musically, he is a very accomplished acoustic guitarist,
and with the help of arranger Robert Kirby he weaves be-
hind himself some fascinating backings including a string
orchestra (excellent stereo perspective), flute, and Ray War-
leigh's tenor saxophone. Although the words are an im-
portant part of the overall effect, Drake's voice does not at-
tract all one's attention; indeed the three instrumental tracks
give the impression of being backing tracks over which he
couldn't be bothered to sing! One really "grooving" track is
"Poor Boy," including Pat Arnold and Doris Troy on chorus.
In the field of sampler LP's, Elektra have recently fol-
lowed the example of CBS, Harvest and Island by issuing
a double album priced at £1.49 — "Garden of Delights."
Whatever your views about collections such as this, it cer-
tainly contains some important tracks by important artists.
The variation is very wide indeed, from Eric Clapton and the
Incredible String Band to one of the most hauntingly beauti-
ful tracks ever recorded — "Someday Soon" by Judy
Collins. In fact, think of an Elektra artist (Love, Paxton, etc.)
and you will probably find a sample of his work on this
bargain LP. Ideally one should be allowed to listen a few
times to records such as this and then take them back in
part-exchange for the half-dozen full price records which
they have persuaded you to buy.
