SHORT STORY by Ian C a r r
'I don't think we were
human.'
The shadow from one of
the decaying college build-
ings put me in dark and
Leper in light, where we
stood in what had been a
road.
'It wasn't so much what
showed on the surface, it was
a rotting from within,' I con-
tinued, 'an emotional dead-
ness that ate your mind
slowly until you suddenly
realised the place itself was
dehumanising you.' It just
seemed like a bad dream be-
ing brought back to mind by
the sight of the collapsing
buildings and withered con-
necting roads, shrivelled to
winding paths. I was taking
Leper on a guided tour of
the ruins of Imperial College,
a place I grew up in.
'Where did you spend your
time?' he asked, 'Did you
live here?'
I nodded. You could see
the halls through the gap in
the houses where the Maths
annexe had gradually rotted
away leaving an untidy hole
by the side of the road. We
walked that way.
'The halls are the few of
the college buildings which
have been kept up in any
way', I said. ' A tribute to the
architects and college plan-
ners, I suppose.' As we
strolled closer we could
just make out the shapes of
the animals pacing behind
the bars where I remembered
there had once been windows.
T can't remember when they
were converted into a zoo, if
converted is the right word.'
We didn't go too near but
I described what the Maths
Annexe was like and pointed
out the bomb crater where
its big brother the Huxley
Building had been.
'It was the only way to get
rid of it,' I explained.
Leper was fascinated by
the ghostlike, menacing air
of the festering ruins.
'You honestly spent 3
years among these?', he
asked me, incredulously.
'That's what I'm trying to
explain', I said, almost
laughing; it was long enough
ago to be nothing much but
vaguely funny now. 'It was
a creeping anaesthesia which
slowly burned away most of
the part of your mind that
cared, and changed the way
we were. You have to have
experienced it to appreciate
it.'
Leper shook his head,
wonderingly. 'Three years',
he whispered to himself
again.
'Well, two and a half to
be honest. The Authorities
isolated me for my last six
months here because I was
having a bad effect on the
other students. It had some-
thing to do with the way I
kept screaming and frothing
at the mouth while I was
wandering around the col-
lege.' I smiled ruefully.
I took my companion
round to where the Queen's
Tower had once stood proud
and useless, but now slumped
limply with its top almost
touching the ground, not
nearly so proud but equally
useless. While we were there
I showed him the large pool
of solidified glass which glis-
tened nearby.
'Chain's palace,' I told
him, 'until it melted.'
We had met no one on our
travels; in the distance you
could just hear the sounds
of London carrying on as
normal some safe distance
from the diseased spot.
From there we wandered
northwards, skirting piles of
rubble where College Block
had been. I talked about the
changes that the College
society had inflicted unob-
trusively but inexorably upon
its victims, without realising
the mortal damage it was
causing to itself in reaction.
Soon we stood by the empty
shell of the Physics building.
T think it was in the
Physics and Maths Depart-
ments that the rot in the col-
lege itself first began to
show.' I remarked. 'The Col-
lege administration became
terribly overworked trying to
make everything go like
clockwork, and weren't
always able to wind up all
the lectures every morning.
Some of the staff started act-
ing human and the system
began to fall apart slowly but
obviously. Student intake
dropped and the college
disease started to manifest
itself in the buildings. You
can see how far it has gone
now'. The smell from the de-
caying Union building was
becoming unbearable so we
decided to call it a day.
Along past the charred
skeleton of Chem. and Aero.
Eng. we walked, further by
the twisted and convoluted
stone sculpture the R.S.M.
had turned into, ghastly and
immovable, past that we
walked, heading back to civil-
isation.
Leper was still entranced
by his view of the mounder-
ing campus, incredulous that
people could ever have lived
and worked there.
'But didn't anyone care?
Anyone?' he kept asking.
'Oh yes, some people
cared, but you had to find
them. And they were few and
far between, for the whole
purpose of the place was to
stop you caring. Stop you
feeling anything but dead.
When the area was finally de-
clared a disaster area almost
half the population had to be
put to sleep as the only mer-
ciful solution to the way they
were.'
Leper said no more, but
walked deep in thought. I
looked ahead. In the dis-
tance the boundary wall was
visible, and with it the decon-
tamination zone coming
slowly nearer.
WOOFF 71
E x p e d i t i o n to the
W o o l w i c h Free F e r r y
11 a.m. saw seven intrepid
explorers set off in two cars
to The Prospect of Whitby,
via Waitrose for essential
fodder, and thence to the
Woolwich Free Ferry. Des-
pite the second car being
shaken off in some drag
racing around Buck House
arrival was beautifully syn-
chronised.
Once on the ferry we dis-
tributed apples and cheese
and had a picnic. Despite
Andy Hinchcliff being called
a skinhead by some gypsies
a good time was had by all.
Sadly the ferry reached the
foreign land south of the
river in about a minute, so
the picnic was hastily ad-
journed to a nearby round-
about where we were amused
by a chopper motorbike that
wouldn't start.
Deciding not to go to
Melanie's flat we returned via
the ferry, holding a beauty
competition on the way, post-
haste to the Prospect where
we just missed closing time.
The expedition was then ad-
journed severally to the
V & A museum, and Virgin
Records in Oxford St. (where
we found it hard to get in).
Two more members of the
expedition arrived at the
Prospect late and reluctantly
stayed there for an hour.
While in the East End we
decided to visit the Lambor-
ghini agents. We were amaz-
ed to notice the salesroom
door unlocked, and on fur-
ther inquiry, we found inside
two Lambos with the keys in
the lock. At this point Andy
ejaculated in his jeans and
we later rang the garage to
beg a test drive in a Miura
(without success).
This expedition was twice
the size of the soggy Neasdex
'70. Further plans involve an
expedition to the disused
Boreham Wood studios
(Borex '71) and to Durham
Castle (Durex '71).

BUSINESS GRADUATE ?
Increasingly this question will be asked. When planning
your own career you will want to consider the possibilities
yourself.
Tlie School of Industrial and Business Studies offers twelve
month programmes leading to Masters degrees in Manage-
ment and Business Studies, Management Science and
Operational Research or Industrial Relations.
About 90 places will be available in these programmes this
year. Applicants, normally in their twenties, should have
an honours degree or equivalent professional qualification;
two or more years' business experience is also an advantage.
Grants are available from the Social Science Research
Council and other sources. Some companies also sponsor
promising young managers.

D r a m s o c
Melodrama is a style of entertainment rarely seen in college
surroundings, and this is the first time that the well-known
Victorian classic, 'The Murder of Maria Marten', has ever
been performed at I.C.
The play is in fact an adaptation of a true story; the main
events took place in Polstead, Suffolk in 1827. William
Corder, the son of a country squire, seduced a local village
girl (Maria Marten), and later murdered her and secreted
her body to avoid scandal and to save his reputation. Maria's
mother experienced recurring dreams after the death in which
she saw the murder taking place, and as a result William
Corder was eventually brought to justice and hanged in 1828
at Bury Gaol. His fame grew; his naked body was exhibited
to the public for some days after the hanging, and many
young ladies queued to see it (he was apparently very well
endowed) and afterwards it was flayed and his skin used to
bind the books in which his trial was recorded.
This term's cast is drawn from the cream of the Society's
acting talent, starring the President as the arch-villain, and
the Vice-President as the female counter villain, as well as
a number of exceedingly sweet and innocent young actresses
(and actors) portraying the equally sweet and innocent
peasantry. Performances will be on 16th to 19th of March.
Verbal contributions from the audience encouraged.
N o N e w s
Nobody at the Victoria & Albert and Science Museums
seemed to know anything about the timing and scope of the
impending museum charges, which made the latest FELIX
PROBE a bit of a flop. However, as part of the stand-on-
your-own-two-feet campaign there's no reason to believe that
we students will get away without paying, so take a look now
while you can afford it.
The V & A flogs some excellent brass rubbing reproduc-
tions for the mere cost of a FELIX, whilst its special exhibi-
tion (which costs) of costumes from the BBC Henry VIII
series seems to be drawing enormous crowds (to the satis-
faction of the alleged Minister for the Arts, no doubt). How-
ever there's a free exhibition of furniture and woodwork at
the moment, and the superb permanent collection of antique
musical instruments is fascinating. Unfortunately the juke
box available to illustrate the instruments is out of order at
present.
G a l l e r i e s
Currently running in London are two art exhibitions with
more than the usual amount of curiosity value. At the Tate
(students admission 15p), is a collection of works by Andy
Warhol, one of the pioneers of Pop Art (1961 onwards). His
technique relies heavily on the use of multiple images, made
possible by the screen-printing process. A painting might
consist of the same image—a flower, portrait of Marilyn
Monroe, a car crash scene, etc., repeated in horizontal rows
across the canvas, using different colours for each image.
Perhaps the most famous Warhols are the Campbells' soup
cans, of which the exhibition contains a whole roomful. Also
on show is his equally notorious pile of 100 Brillo boxes,
which are, in actual fact, screen-printed blocks of wood.
Unfortunately, Warhol's pioneering work now seems some-
what tame in an age when Pop Art is commonplace.
At the Hayward Gallery, in contrast, is the Arts Council
exhibition "Art in Revolution", which gives an insight into
artistic goings-on in Russia in the period following the Bol-
shevik revolution. This was a time when it seemed that
communism and freedom of expression could exist side-by-
side, a hope which is now shattered by present Soviet and
Chinese policies. The exhibition covers a very wide range
of disciplines from propaganda films to stage design to archi-
tecture—art in the narrow sense of paintings and sculpture
comprises only a minor portion. Entrance is again 15p if you
take your students card, and well worth the effort if you
have a taste for the unusual. Indeed, the layout of the exhi-
bits is almost a work of art in itself.
R e v u e
22 February was the occasion of the Holbein Student
House dinner, held in the Union. As an after-dinner enter-
tainment, the residents, led by Kevin Schofield, organised a
revue in the upper refec. Everyone was invited to this effort
at a nominal cost of 5p, but very few people turned up, per-
haps because the excellent posters were all nicked.
For an almost off-the-cuff production, the standard of the
items was very high, with a liberal dose of quick-fire humour
(clean!) and a film made entirely by the Holbeinites, led by
their expert sub-warden John Osborne. Compared with the
combined efforts of C & G college as witnessed the previous
week, this revue was a triupmph for Student House Com-
munity Spirit.
