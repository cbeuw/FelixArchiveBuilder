11th March, 1971 FELIX Page 3
E D I T O R I A L
This is the last FELIX for this term, and is also the last
issue for me as Editor. I quickly found that producing a good
FELIX is a time-consuming and responsible job, so I won't
be passing on the editorship with a great deal of regret.
Taking over on the next two issues will be John Rogers, a
postgraduate in the Elec Eng Department. Contributions for
the next issue should preferably be hi before the end of this
term. Perhaps I needn't repeat this, but staff are still wanted
for next year. People are beginning to drift in and help, but
more are still needed.
With hustings today and elections coming soon, I.C. has
been beseiged by the various presidential advertising cam-
paigns. If you haven't actually met any of the candidates yet,
then here is your chance today. The hustings always provide
a battle of wits, often resulting in quite a fascinating ordeal
for the candidates. See how your candidate stands up to pres-
sure !
With the recent appearance of yet another organ of com-
munication in the College, PRIVATE I.C., surely the situa-
tion is tending towards saturation. The contributors to all
these media are very welcome to help make FELLX a more
effective paper, especially since we do receive a not incon-
siderable subsidy. It's not our fault if, as PRIVATE I.C.
claims, "FELIX is written by the Editor and a few friends."

A n o t h e r d a y i n the
l i f e ?
Dear Editor.
I was very pleased to see
your diarist's letter, speaking
out for us, the silent majority
in Imperial College.
I was so inspired by his
conclusions, that I decided
to track down the source of
the irresponsible elements
within I.C. The story that
follows contains intrigue to
rival any Worker's Press
expose.
Preliminary investigation
led me to the Union build-
ing, where long-haired un-
washed were muttering words
like 'Think', 'Diversify'. I'll
bet H . G Wells wasn't up
against that sort of thing.
Unswayed, I continued with
my mission. Following a
trail of beer bottles up
several flights of stairs led
me to the door behind which
all manner of subversive
plots were under discussion.
On the door was the name
of a society, smeared in
greasepaint; let us call it
'FANTASOC.
Eager to discover their
plans, I stooped towards the
key hole; alas it was filled
with Araldite. I listened in-
tently. Ideas to form an
affiliated society, UN-
FOUNDED RUMASOC,
were punctuated with lines
from Macbeth. Amid the
confusion, I could only dis-
cern words like 'Mike',
'Maria', together with what
sounded like the ceremonial
burning of a Worker's Press.
However, the worst was yet
to come. Without hesitation,
a voice called for all the
latest problem sheets; a new
dart design had been per-
fected. A l l at once the full
horror of the idea struck
me; two problems were still
unsolved on my latest sheet.
I hurried away to the
library, reflecting on this
strange night's adventure.
Have these people no idea
of what life's about?

Whoever has least points at the end of the Hustings
stands little chance of being elected as President.

Concern
Dear Sir,
It is with great sorrow that
I read in every issue of
FELIX the reports of only
the Rugby Club, Football
Club, Hockey Club and
Rowing Club. One gets the
impression that no other
sports or recreations are
practised at I.C.
I.C.U. proudly claims that
it has as many clubs as, if
not more than, U.L.U. Might
it be too much strain on
FELIX's resources to re-
quest reports on these rela-
tively obscure clubs?
Yours sadly,
Concerned of Guilds.
And another
Dear Sir,
May we the undersigned
say how much we deplore
the attitude of the writer of
the article " A day in the
life", who incidentally has
not the courage to sign his
piece.
We members of Elec. Eng.
2 are all hard-working stu-
dents and the fact that such
a student should be in our
midst, attempting to disturb
the studious atmosphere, is
to be deplored.
Yours ad nauseam, libritum
et infinitum,
R. G. Woodhead,
R. G. Woodhead,
R. G. Woodhead,
R. G. Woodhead,
etc. etc.
P.S. Anyway, your name is
Editor, not Diary, isn't it?
