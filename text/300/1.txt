IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, M A R C H 11,1971
EX-POLICEMAN
AIDS BURSAR
A disabled messenger in
I.C. has been forced by the
college to remain on per-
manent early shift (6.30 a.m.
to 3.30 p.m.). The messen-
ger, feeling entitled to have
some turns on the later shift
9 a.m. to 6 p.m.) made a re-
quest to the establishment
office and gave details of his
travelling difficulties. The
messenger is a polio victim
and wears an iron caliper on
his leg. This fact and the un-
reliability of public trans-
port makes it necessary for
him to rise at 5 a.m. every
day, and even then he might
reach college late.
The request was looked
into by the College and then
considered by the College's
Messengers and Security
Guards Consultative Com-
mittee. Mr. Seaford, the Bur-
sar, is chairman of the com-
mittee which is a bit like
"JURGO" used to be. On
the consultative committee
— annoyingly it was repor-
ted to Mr. Seaford by the
head messenger Mr. Bass-
horn — an ex-police detec-
tive-sergeant — that he had
'proceeded' to the address of
the messenger concerned and
paced the distance from his
house to the bus-stop; then
checked the early bus and
train times and calculated
that the disabled messenger
had 'no valid reason for
wishing to change his work-
ing hours.'
One would think that Lon-
don Transport alone would
provide a reason for fair
treatment — but no! The
movements of a disabled
man who asks for fair treat-
ment are subjected to de-
tective style investigations.
If members of the College
authorities have time to
spare undertaking such in-
human acts they should be
sacked !

SILLY ASSAS
Certain residents in South
Side were thought to be dis-
tinctly embarrassed by a ser-
ies of posters which appeared
overnight last Friday adver-
tising an alleged YEUK-
SOC presentation, namely
"THE KEYSTONE LOCK-
SMITHS," the stars of
which you can probably
guess, so we won't bother to
name names. (In any case,
the next issue of PRIVATE
I.C. will probably tell you).
An agile collection of critical
comments such as "The key
to all your problems" (Brass-
workers Weekly), "What
brilliant acting" (I.C. Main-
tainance) (their bad spelling,
not ours), "Watch this pair"
(Head of C.I.D.) and "It's on
the level, Bugsie" (The
Quality Street Gang) added
further amusement. Regret-
tably, few people saw the
notice, which was at one
time displayed on every
landing in South Side, due to
certain residents of South
Side hurriedly removing
them to avoid further em-
barrassment to themselves.
SENNET STOLEN
P I E R S C O M M E N T S
Last week some I.C. stu-
dents, acquaintances of Mr.
Steve Cooke, stole about
1000 copies of SENNET
(which had been delivered
one day late) from the Un-
ion Office. I realise that the
persons concerned probably
disagree with many opinions
expressed in SENNET, but
I do not feel that this justi-
fies them preventing the
great mass of I.C. students
from reading such views —
we can all make up our own
minds !
I, and my friends, have
never prevented literature of
right wing opinon (eg; the
Broadsheets, Private I.C.) be-
ing circulated or disturbed.
We believe that there must
always be free discussion —
without it people will never
be able to form their own
ideas.
We find the actions of
those persons reprehensible;
I am the more concerned be-
cause many people who have
taken exception to some
points in previous issues of
SENNET found this issue
"much better," yet it is be-
ing denied from most stu-
dents (unless I can get hold
of more copies at the ex-
pense of other students else-
where).
This is not the first time
in I.C. that persons on the
extreme right have done this
sort of thing. Two years ago
such persons stole posters,
publicity and petitions which
were part of the campaign to
change the Union's Consti-
tution; one year ago such
persons tried to beat me up;
more recently they have
been manhandling women of
different, yet perfectly valid,
political views out of I.C.
Union and South Side bars;
and most recently they
forced a friend of mine
(Ricardo) into the Round
Pond because they didn't
agree with him.
We cannot sit back and al-
low these ugly tendencies to
operate as a sort of "vigi-
lante squad." The situation
is serious — that is why
Ricardo decided to take two
of the persons who helped
drag him to the Pond to
court; but this is not
enough — we must all be on
our guard.
I have asked the Deputy
President to do what he can
t i l ?
.......... i f
to bring the students who
stole the copies of SENNET
before Council for discip-
linary action. As I under-
stand it, these people have
been stealing Union proper-
ty, since SENNET is dis-
tributed under the auspices
of I.C.U. I hope that anyone
who knows anything about
the matter will inform Tony
Kirkham, and that anyone
who has any influence over
Mr. Cooke will point out to
him that if he is a respon-
sible member of Council he
will say who stole the
SENNETS—he admits that
he knows, but refuses to tell.
Yours,
Piers Coroyn,
Editor of SENNET.
News In Brief
FELIX wonders why the
new, and very welcome, PRI-
VATE I.C. contains so many
references to Dennis "3
arrests" Taylor and Steve
"Capitalism works" Cooke.
The latter is described in the
organ as "infamous" and
"well known head of Ges-
tapo at I.C." and is thought
to condone stealing copies of
SENNET and a little healthy
queer-bashing. Messrs. (in-
deed) Taylor and Cooke,
whilst peddling copies last
week, strenuously denied any
connection with the organ.
If this is really yet another
ego-trip medium, it seems to
be rather a costly one. Evi-
dently the disposal of 2000
copies is proving more dif-
ficult than anticipated, and
heavy losses will have to be
borne personally by the
backers' overdrafts.
Rumours that there are
no women available for the
Carnival Computer Dating
Scheme are categorically de-
nied.
A park bench still serves
as a useful adjunct to the
seating available in Fal-
mouth Hall.
The Chairman of the Con-
servative Society is rumoured
to have declined to speak in
the recent debate concerning
whether or not socialism is
a worthless dream. Could
the present lamentable fail-
ure of the Tories ("Force
them to resign" — P. Gil-
lette) to make capitalism
work, as witnessed by their
attempt to get an incomes
policy in all but name, be
giving him troubles?
The Lyon Playfair Library
will be open during the
Easter vacation (apart from
8th to 14th April) from 9.30
a.m. to 9.30 p.m. on Mon-
days to Fridays, and from
9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on
Saturdays.
Uncle Bill informs us that
Prof. Ball will be Dean of
The Royal School of Mines.
Steve Cooke admits to
having a pile of SENNETS
in the back of his car (red
very noisy M.G. Midget).
When is the abysmal Cooke
going to return these stolen
goods at present in his pos-
session?
McCullough's bumf sheet
is apparently posted in every
bog in College — is this part
of his campaign for soft
paper, or does it point to
something more fundamen-
tal ?
The protracted postal
strike must have caused
slight consternation in the
College Bookshop which ap-
peared to be well stocked
with St. Valentines Day
cards.
The Rag Mag should be
out by the end of term; ap-
parently good and filthy.
Peter Hain, well known
anti-apartheid campaigner,
and lately a student at I.C.,
is now a first year student
in economics at Queen Mary
College.
