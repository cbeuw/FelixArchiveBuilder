No time for all those mainstream games? Fed up with talking to other human beings? How about a bit of hot
Flash action? Felix Games provides...

The evil of mankind was too much, and the
Gods decided to replace us with a bunch of
small sentient animals. A millenium later, bored
demons attack, and the only warrior around is a
West Highland Terrier on a horse. Makes sense.
You are Paladog, a noble warrior who can
wield magic and summon an army of critters
to fight with him. Earn gold and experience, up-
grade and take the fight back to the demons.
Cute, colourful and excruciatingly addicting.

“They’ve squeezed us all dry. Now they promise
to ship me out... After I play a little game...” Sen-
tient oranges and Russian roulette don’t usu-
ally go hand in hand, but they do now. You are
an orange, waiting to be shipped out. Just time
for one more game...
For a simple random chance game Orange
Roulette is both eerily creepy and tense. Do you
spin the chamber, aim at your opponent – or put
the barrel to your own zesty temple and pull?
Biology! Despite the fact that Phage Wars
doesn’t actually contain any true phages (vi-
ruses that attack bacteria, don’t you know?) it’s
still pretty fun. Infect other cells, and use them
to launch an attack against rival amoebae (or
whatever the hell they are).
Use ‘gene upgrades’ to splice up your cell
and make them faster, stronger and more
deadly. Genetic recombination has never been
so simple!
/ESCAPE\ is one of those games that’s easy to
pick up but (moderately) difficult to master. The
controls are simple – Escape is the only key you
press, and the whole point of the game is to
escape a pit lined with electrical traps.
Execution is a little harder though – there’s
a laser on your tail, so slow down too much as
you’ll get fried. Mistime a jump, get fried. Play
these Flash games too much during revision?
Get fried (but not literally).
Most games have achievements, but then
again most don’t give them out for pausing the
game or offering food to a giant guinea pig king
stuck in a hamster tube.
Achievement Unlocked 3 is for the under-
achievers amongst us – you get about 10
achievements for simply starting the game and
moving. Slowly they get harder and harder to
earn, and soon even achievement farmers will
be scratching their heads. A cool time waster.
Something less stressful to ease exam and
project tension? Starlight 2’s your game.
It’s an ingenious concept – you’re given a
seemingly random constellation, and it’s your
job to rotate and twist them around until you
form a recognizable shape or object. The eas-
ier levels require just a little twisting, whilst
the harder ones demand more thought. A thor-
oughly relaxing and original game through and
through.
Ever dreamed of becoming the next H5N1 vi-
rus? Me neither, but Infectonator 2 is still worth
your time.
You start up your global reign of terror with
something that could be outcompeted by the
common cold. Start to infect people, upgrade
your virus to be faster, more virulent and over-
all more badass, and soon you’ll make Spanish
Flu look like a small blip. Keep an eye on the
time – this game can be a massive time sink!
Puzzle games like Clockwork aren’t usually my
thing, but it reminded me too much of old child-
hood block puzzles.
Twist and turn rotating blocks around their
paths, blocking them off to create a clear path
for your sunbeam in the middle to escape from.
Things can get messy if you let them circle
around freely, so a certain amount of logical
thinking is required. You must ask yourself one
question: ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH?
