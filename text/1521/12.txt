COMMENT
I
f you are old enough to re-
member dB’s (the club before
Metric) then you’ll probably
conjure up images of a dingy,
dark club that was falling to
pieces and famously unpopular out-
side of Wednesday sports’ nights.
The room wasn’t particularly great
with the tiny bar hidden away at
the back and a sideways stage that
meant no-one could stand in front of
it, and the rest of the room couldn’t
really hear properly. For DJs it was
fine, and for band nights it was okay,
and in the last few years the Union’s
multi-million redevelopment has
seen it transform into Metric, but I’m
not convinced it’s living up to its full
potential.
The Union has a good history of
attracting some big names. Previous
Summer Balls have included the Noi-
settes, Chase and Status, Plan B, and
Laura Marling. We’ve had Pendu-
lum, the New Young Pony Club, and
if you go back far enough and add a
pinch of salt, even Queen! Big Union
events have come hand-in-hand with
big names (sometimes adding to the
financial failure), and there are a
handful of student organised nights
throughout the term, but where is the
middle ground?
You might ask whether there is
a desire for live bands at Imperial,
with many people choosing to avoid
the Union for their nights out, in-
stead favouring the plethora of oth-
er clubs out in London. But decent
bands have so much more to offer
than that particular DJ’s latest music
fad, played to the max in a room so
dark you can’t see whether it’s your
snakebite or someone else’s drink
that you’ve spilt until you slip on the
polished concrete floor and it seeps
into the newly formed crack in your
head. The atmosphere in a packed out
Metric and diversity of music from
a good selection of bands is sure to
tickle everyone’s fancy, it may not
be your favourite ‘take your bra off
and attempt to make love to them on-
Reaching Metric’s full potential
stage’ boy band group but would you
expect that at Imperial (and would
you want it?). Last year’s Summer
Ball proved that people aren’t willing
to pay through the nose for their own
mini private festival, but surely there
must be a happy medium where it’s
affordable and enjoyable?
But there’s more to live entertain-
ments than your standard five-piece
band. Once upon a time, back in
2010, Isy Suttie (aka “Dobby” from
Peep Show) did her stand-up show
to a packed dB’s, her intriguing mix
of acoustic musical stand-up was
popular, witty, and went down well
amongst the crowd. But to my knowl-
edge, this hasn’t been tested out in
our new venue, the basement feel of
Metric surely must make it ideal for
stand-up, hell why not combine com-
edy and live music?
It’s unfortunate than Metric suffers
from the building it’s surrounded by,
the irregular narrowing at the Western
end forces the stage to be abnormally
small, smaller than its predecessor,
the PA design has had its teething
problems but it’s still a vast improve-
ment on its former self. However, it’s
still very possible to run successful
events, as proved by Jazz & Rock,
who run regular Jam Nights, Felix
Music Nights, and Guitar Soc, who
host Open-Mic nights, but these very
successful events are still relatively
ad hoc, the booking process is hazy
and fraught with obstacles, and limit-
ed to particular slots (We Are Metric:
Thursday & Saturday).
In my mind, the irony is that Met-
ric was supposed to be better for this,
it was supposed to be an improve-
ment! During Metric’s construction
I remember conversations with the
then Union General Manager were so
hopeful towards a bright and happy
future for Metric, with named and up-
coming bands performing regularly
and students contributing towards its
success. That vision of building up a
vibrant live music scene at Imperial
seems a long way off, building up a
fan base and interested clientele can
be difficult, but many of the student
run events have been recently born
and continue to thrive.
One might argue that there is a fi-
nancial risk from hiring in bands, and
while true it is worth remembering
that the costs of renovating Metric
still needs to be recouped over the
coming years; large festival headline
acts probably aren’t going to make it
their new home, but we can’t compete
with that so why would we try? Stu-
dents want to come to the Union for
a cheap, fun night out, but the same
thing each week will only attract peo-
ple who just want to get bladdered in
a dark room (I’ve done this, but not
weekly); the Union seems stuck in
its old ways still, and I think variety
would get profits.
The student input into Metric so
Metric, metric. Geddit. Geddit. Geddit? It’s a visual pun. What? It’s been a
long week in the Felix dungeon
In my mind,
the irony is
that Metric was
supposed to be
better... it was
supposed to be
an improvement

the iro
far seems to be on the up, and events
such as ‘Heal These Wounds’ Album
Launch and ‘Diggidy Dawg’ Felix
Music Night are on over the next
two weekends, and Summer Ball,
the biggest event of the year, soon
after. So why can’t all these great
events and proven ideas be brought
together into an accessible and well
advertised Friday/Saturday night mu-
sic scene, mixing acoustic, comedy,
live bands, open-mic, and then the
classic cheese/drum and bass/dub-
step/trance... Why shouldn’t there be
something good on at the Union ev-
ery week; that was what was meant to
be! Something to tease in the punters
to spend even more of their precious
pennies on lemonades and ice teas,
scrape back some of the recent losses
and provide top-notch entertainment
at the same time.
Cat got your tongue?
Rendezvous, with me, the Library, say 2 (am) and we can go through any
notes you want me to. Tonight will be the night. When you close your eyes,
take a minute, take a moment, realise, do you understand maths?
