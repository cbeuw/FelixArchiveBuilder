On a sweltering 27 May at the Har-

and Bernard Sunley Hornets FC over-
came last year’s winners, Beit Hall FC,
to clinch the Interhall Evelyn Gardens
Cup.
Season
Starting the season back in October,
the S&BS team looked shoddy. Open-
ing with friendlies against Holbein &
Willis Jackson FC and Fisher Hall FC,
Southwell delivered a couple of poor
performances which didn’t pick up as
the season began. The first success of
the year was a default victory against
a disinterested Pembridge FC, who
failed to show up. Hindered by incon-

a major turning point. With the posi-
tion in the league rapidly dwindling
and hopes of making the play-off stage
appearing to fade away, such a defeat
was what the team needed in order to
wake up and smell the coffee before
the season was lost entirely.
The second half of the season saw
Southwell improve drastically as
a more consistent squad of players
