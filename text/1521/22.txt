JuJu is an award winning bar located in the
heart of glamorous Chelsea on King’s Road.
It’s the ideal place for after work drinks or
a pre-clubbing warm up. JuJu offers the fin-
est cocktails in London, including the popu-
lar Pornstar Martini, mixed by undoubtedly
brilliant bartenders. For the more “spendy”
readers out there, you can also find an ex-
tensive list of wines and champagnes.
The amazing thing about JuJu is that it also
includes a short (yet fulfilling) list of nibbles.
To accompany our drinks we ordered veg-
etable spring rolls, chicken strips, duck rolls,
basil king prawns, and several dips with pita
bread. Well, you could say that it was more
of a feast than a typical Friday night out. You
would be wrong however: JuJu combines
cocktails and food very harmonically, allow-
ing us to report that it really has created a new
“bar night” experience with reasonable prices.
So, how about organizing an end of aca-
demic year party in one of the reserved ar-
eas of JuJu, especially decorated to create
the suitable atmosphere for an unforgettable
night out with friends and colleagues? You
shouldn’t visit JuJu if you’d prefer to have a
quiet chat though; get ready to dance the
night away and let the music bring you clos-
er to your summer destination!
JuJu 316 – 318 King’s Road, Chelsea,
SW3 5UH. Open Monday to Saturday, Sun-
day for private bookings. For more infor-
mation, visit www.jujulondon.com or call
