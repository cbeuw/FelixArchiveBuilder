Privatisation: the dangers of
In the second of a series of articles on the privatisation of our universities, Stephen Smith asks
and your company logo will be dis-
played in the Careers office.
Doesn’t sound worth it? I under-
stand. But if you donate more than
£1,000 you get some special benefits!
An annual dinner with Careers Advis-
ers (yes, that’s right, an annual dinner
with Careers Advisers), a link to your
company on the College website, pri-
ority booking at Careers events, dis-
counts on targeted emails and adverts
in Career Choice magazine.
You’ll be in good company, too:
with nine other Consultancy firms in
the Club (see below) you’ll never be
lonely.
Careers Fairs
You could go to one of Imperial’s five
sector-specific careers fairs in Bank-
ing, Technology, Engineering, Science
or Internships. You’ll have to pay to go
to any of these, except the Internships
fair, which is free.
You could even sponsor a careers
fair! How, you ask? Here’s how! If you
pay extra you’ll get to put your stand
at the front of the marquee, you’ll get
your logo on the front and back of the
fair brochure, you’ll get your name and
website on careers emails to students,
so they’ll never forget you.
Advertising
You can send an email to students!
£100 will buy you a “Targeted Email”
to 300 of them.
You can have your name and logo on
the Services leaflet (opposite), a book-
let that tells students what the Careers
I
t’s a searingly hot day in cen-
tral London. The sun beats
down on the Queen’s Lawn as
an acquaintance and I pass by a
monstrous, awkward marquee.
Inside, emissaries from various compa-
nies appeal for students’ attention with
all the enthusiasm of sleepy clams.
The students scurry from table to table
hoarding pens and slightly disappoint-
ing key-rings.
It’s Careers Fair season at Imperial.
We look through the door. Consul-
tancy...Marketing...Solutions... The
words melt into a bland soup of mean-
inglessness and ooze towards us like
ominous death-sludge.
Boldly, we step over the threshold,
and an all-pervasive tiredness greets us.
For a while we float around the sweaty
marquee, acknowledging but ignoring
the frequent, empty cries of bored men
in suits: “Excuse me, are you interested
in consulting?” There isn’t much for
the likes of us here.
My acquaintance and I sit bemusedly
on the steps outside the giant tent, con-
templating our futures. “I don’t want
to work in finance,” he announces, ex-
hausted by the punishing sun, “but it
doesn’t feel like there’s anything else.”
My acquaintance is not the only one
disappointed by the apparent variety of
choice we have. When I wrote last term
about Imperial’s Careers Service, a lot
of people responded. Some thought
the service was doing a good job, oth-
ers thought the opposite. But everyone
agreed on one thing: the service could
and should do more to promote careers
other than the usual banking/consulting
options.
This article asks why the service
doesn’t do this already, and indeed,
why the careers services at other uni-
versities behave in very similar ways.
A case study: Imperial
Imagine, for a few minutes, that you
are a company. A consultancy firm, say,
that offers integrated management and
workplace solutions. You follow? Me
neither. But never mind, let’s soldier
on. You want to recruit some Imperial
students: here’s a list of things you can
do.
Patron’s Club
For an undisclosed sum, you could join
the Patron’s Club! What is it? “An op-
portunity for you to invest in the future
development of the Careers Advisory
Service.” You’ll receive a newsletter,
Advisory Service does.
Or perhaps you’d prefer to advertise
in the Imperial Guide to Career Plan-
ning, or the magazine Career Choice?
These are the services which our
Careers Service offers to businesses
to “raise their profile”, services which
seem to shift the balance of power
away from students and towards com-
panies.
But according to Elspeth Farrar, the
Director of the Careers Service, “stu-
dent preferences are what inform the
Service’s operations, rather than ap-
proaches from employers.”
“The Careers Advisory Service aims
to ensure it caters for all student needs,
not just the majority,” she said.
Indeed, the Careers Service does a
lot more than is at first apparent. When
last term I complained about the lack
of help for students interested in chari-
ties, Farrar directed me to “Charity
Insights”, a brand new scheme which
gives 20 students £880 each to work in
a charity over the summer.
The responses I received to my pre-
vious article back this up.Though most
were negative about the service, nearly
everyone who had used it directly (for
example, talked to careers advisers)
had thought it was excellent. “They’re
very good, if you go in with the right
mentality,” one person told me, “some-
thing that I had to learn.”
Another student said, “the only expe-
rience I’ve had is getting them to look
over my CV for a UROP placement.
Very helpful.”
The problem, then, is not the Ca-
reers Service itself, but rather how it is
perceived by students who experience
sponsored aspects (careers fairs, tar-
geted emails) instead of non-sponsored
ones (the careers library, direct advice).
And, of course, how this perception af-
fects their own lives.
The Problem
It is so easy to get caught up in the
“banking is the only option” frame of
mind, especially when repeated emails,
adverts and careers fair stalls all push
this perspective.
As one student told me, “The life that
is most pushed down Imperial students’
throats is banking and banking-related
jobs.” Students are largely unaware of
the subtle and unintentional facts that
lead them to this conclusion.
They are unaware, for instance, that
the stalls in careers fairs are not po-
sitioned by random, but according to
how much money each company has
to spare.
It’s important to be aware that the
companies advertised on the careers
service leaflets are not those recom-
mended by advisers, nor those with the
best reputations, or the best employ-
ment rights, but rather the wealthiest
ones, who can afford to donate.
It’s important to know that we re-
