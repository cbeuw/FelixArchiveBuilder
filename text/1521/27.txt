SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots.
The numbers in each square in-
dicate how many edges of the
square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting a
week to see the solution will also
do). Answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, as the puzzles
team recieves one hour off for
Christmas per correct solution.
Your puzzles editor is back and thus a return of the quick crossword. Hooray!

Nonogram – And Here’s My Little Secret...
I KILLED MUFASA!
The cells in a grid
have to be coloured
or left blank accord-
ing to numbers at the
side of the grid.
The numbers meas-
ure how many unbro-
ken lines of filled-in
squares there are in
any given row or
column. Look at last
week’s solution to see
what a typical solu-
tion looks like.
The overall solu-
tion should yield
some sort of picture,
or as good as a pic-
ture can look in mon-
ochrome on a 15x15
grid.
As usual, answers
to puzzles.felix@im-
perial.ac.uk.
