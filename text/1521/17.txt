tracks, ‘Children at Play’ and ‘e’, that
I created under my old alias.
What does the future hold for you?
Are there any new releases we can
look forward to?
Yes, I’m working on a 7” which will
be released on Lefse Records and still
working on some other new songs for
my new album. There are some other
exciting projects planned in the near
future, but I’m unable to talk about
them yet, and there are also some re-
mixes remaining to be achieved!
My other wish is having some mer-
ch as well like t-shirts, posters, bags
etc… but that will be the next step. I
want to find someone to collaborate
with for this, so if there are some in-
I’ve been a fan of My Bloody Val-
entine for quite a while, and Kevin
Shields is someone I hold with high
regard. Reading interviews where he
talks about MBV’s sound process has
really helped me a lot with my own
work. At the moment, I’m digging
Evenings, Gold Panda, Twin Em-
pire, Jason Urik (who I met in Inns-
bruck), Shigeto and How To Dress
Well, but of course there are many
many more!
What’s the music scene in Luxem-
bourg like?
It’s a small scene but with lots of very
interesting artists making great music!
I shared some on my Facebook page
over the past few days and if you want
to stay tuned for more just follow me
on facebook.com/listen2sunglitters.
If you could sum up living in Lux-
embourg in three words, what would
they be?
Small, beautiful and good living.
What feeling do you try and convey
with your music? Or what you do
want people to feel when they listen
to your music?
I really hope people enjoy listening to
my music. I hope it captures a special
moment, a moment that they can recall
fondly in the future. It’s inspiring when
people write to me and tell me that my
music has helped them get through bad
moments or that my music encouraged
them to be creative, by doing their own
music, or making paintings for exam-
ple. That’s one of the biggest rewards
when making music.
What is the worst thing about mak-
ing music? And the best?
If there is a negative aspect to making
music, it has to be deadlines or reach-
ing a point where you aren’t happy
with the results you’ve created…
The best thing about making music is
the creative process for sure. Trying to
make new sounds or songs and playing
live and hanging around with people
who enjoy your music.
What’s your proudest achievement?
I feel I’ve achieved a lot, but every-
thing could be fine is surely my best
work ever! I still listen to these tracks
and enjoy them as much as I did the
first day they were recorded. That’s a
good sign for me. But I’m also proud
of my very first EP when I started
making electronic music, called in2
the skies. I’m pleased with two other
T
ell us a bit about your-
self. Did you grow up
in a musical household?
What kind of music did
you listen to growing
up?
My name is Victor Ferreira and I com-
pose and perform under the moniker,
Sun Glitters. I was born in Luxem-
bourg in 1973 and sadly I didn’t really
grow in a musical household…
I remember my first record was a
12”, a Hit Connection Compilation
with artists like Billy Ocean, Pia
Zadorra, Michael Jackson, Duran
Duran, etc… It wasn’t until later on
that I grew to like music by The Cure,
My Bloody Valentine and bands like
that...
How did you start making music?
I started playing bass in rock bands.
I then discovered artists like Portis-
head, Massive Attack, Third Eye
Foundation, and Boards Of Canada,
who brought about a new fascination
with electronic music. That’s when I
purchased my first Groovebox…
I also have fond memories of rap-
ping and making hip-hop when I was
younger… I first approached my sam-
pling technique when I bought a sam-
pler; it was after this that I started mak-
ing melodies with a guitar and a bass.
Is Sun Glitters your first project or
were there others before?
Like I mentioned before, I started
playing bass in several rock bands. I
was also involved in electronic proj-
ects including a duo called stereOner-
ic and another personal project called
sug(r)cane...
You don’t only make music – it
seems you also do your own artwork.
What’s the benefit of having direct
creative control over all aspects of
your music?
I worked with a small company as a
graphic designer. Ever since I was
young I’ve enjoyed drawing illustrat-
ing and creating handmade flyers, for
example. I work under the artist name
madebyjujo, and you can find my
stuff at www.madebyhujo.com. Later
on, I started to take photos which I’ve
incorporated into the artwork for Sun
Glitters. I felt it was important to cre-
ate a visual identity to run side-by-side
with the music.
Which musicians inspire you and
who are you listening to at the mo-
ment?
Sun Glitters flies over for the Felix Music Night
Kadhim Shubber talks with the Luxembourger ahead of his appearance at Diggidy Dawg next Saturday
terested people, get in touch with me!
Angela Merkel phones you up and
says, “Victor, we need you to save
the Euro with music. What songs do
you play?”
Haha, maybe ‘too much to lose’ and
‘everything could be fine’ ;)
You’re at a bakery in London, about
to buy a pasty. You can have it pip-
ing hot, slightly warm, or room tem-
perature. Which is cheapest?
I would choose slightly warm...
You’re asked to perform at the
opening ceremony of the Olympics,
but as you go on stage you notice
the absent-minded organisers have
failed to provide you with any in-
struments. What do you do?
I just felt a sense of déjà vu! Not at the
Olympics, mind you. It wouldn’t be
the first time that I arrived in a venue
and that they forgot something that
was included in my tech rider, haha
So, I would stay calm and try to solve
the problem as best as I could… I think
as long as I had my laptop, everything
would be okay, and I would just make
it work.
But if I was forced to be a bit more
creative for the situation, then I would
take the microphone and sing, mim-
icking the missing instruments the best
I could!
Did he fall asleep on those flowers or is he just hiding behind them? Is that poison ivy?
