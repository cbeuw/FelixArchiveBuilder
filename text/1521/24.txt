Hangman Declared Dead: Westeros Rejoices
Ladies and Gentlemen of Imperial
College London, it is I, the old
Imperial Memes admin. Hangman
is dead. He shall not return, and
the good people of Westeros will
no longer be forced to endure his
terrible reign. He has been found
guilty of treason, boring jokes,
and poor personal hygiene. Some
counselled me to send him to the
Wall, to take up the Black – but
Hangman is not deserving of mercy.
So that’s that then. The old
hacks have been booted out, and
Imperial’s shittiest meme fan page
now sits on the Iron Throne.
What can you expect from your
new King over the next couple of
weeks? For starts, you shouldn’t
“expect” anything – like the
historically accurate serfs that you
are, you should expect to stay out
of my way lest you are brutally
murdered or spanked with a big
sceptre at crossbow-point.
Anyone who tries to unseat me
will be summarily burnt to a crisp
by wildfire and my mother will be
dealing with any Felix douchebags
who think they know better than me.
So sit back, try not to starve, and
enjoy the ride. Complaints can be
addressed to The Rotting Corpses
at Mud Gate and if anyone wants
to marry me, I’ll be glad to drop the
Stark bitch at a moment’s notice...

This photo of the ‘Tank Man’
from 1989 is one of the most
iconic in history. It shows a
man, clearly at the end of his
tether, perhaps with nothing
more to lose, facing down a
column of tanks. The events
that led to this moment are
relatively unknown in China;
the Chinese Government
suppresses any attempts to
publicly commemorate them.
The video footage of this
incredible moment shows the
tanks hesitantly try to drive
around him, before he steps
onto the lead tank and speaks
to the tank driver. We can only
speculate as to what this brave
and crazy man said...
“My son... he got a 2:2...”

Student Decides, On Balance, That
Living in South London Isn't Worth It
Tom Riley is coming to the end of
his third year at Imperial and is
desperate for the contract on his
three-bed flat in Elephant & Castle
to run out. “I’m really just looking
forward to moving back to Fulham
for my final year,” he told The Litter
Tray. “Elephant & Castle was fun
at first, you know, it felt like proper
London. But after the 3rd or 4th
time, getting mugged really loses
its appeal”.
What does he like more about
Fulham then? “The general
soullessness of it – you can try to
fight it, but after three years of EEE,
I’ve got to admit it makes me feel
right at home...”
Student named Troll of the Year by FHM
Men’s magazine FHM has honoured
Imperial student Christopher
Kaye’s diligent efforts in the
pursuit of “Trolling”. They called
his manifesto for Gender Equality
Officer, the entirety of which is
simply “I don’t believe this post
need exist”, a triumphant piece of
feminist-baiting, the likes of which
haven’t been seen since the last
time David Starkey was on TV.
The Litter Tray spoke with one of
Christopher Kaye’s close friends,
who wished to remain anonymous,
and asked him if this kind of behav-
iour was out of character. The friend
merely shrugged and replied, “That
shit Kaye...”
