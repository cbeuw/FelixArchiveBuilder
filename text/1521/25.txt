This week, a massive gam-
ma ray burst from outer
space affects nobody and
nothing except you. You
gain the incredible super-
power of “Frowning In De-
spair” and before you know
it, you’re using all of your
newly acquired superpow-
ers on Question 1, Part (a) of
your first exam...
This week, the alignment of
the constellation of Orion with
the hairs on your ball-sack al-
low you a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to meet Samuel
L. Blackson, as you mistak-
enly call him while shaking his
hand. He Mace Windus you in
the throat. You croak “Thank
you, Mr Blackson”, but he
mercifully doesn’t hear...
This week, Venus’ transit
across the Sun will result in
a catastrophic weakening of
your anal muscles mid-exam.
Your options are to accept
the soul-destroying social
repercussions, or to go “full
retard”, throw excrement
around the exam hall and
hope you get extra marks for
“mitigating circumstances”...
This week, Peter Weyland
was on the ship all along. The
planet Prometheus visits is
home to the aliens that creat-
ed humanity but now want to
destroy us for a sequel bait-
ing unexplained reason, and
the “aaaah, freakout!” Alien
that we know and love is sim-
ply tacked on to the end of the
film as an afterthought.
This week, the conjunction
of your mom’s ass with my
“slapping hand” results in
what can only be termed as
a “restraining order” and the
irreversible end of our friend-
ship. In an attempt to lose
your “slapping hand”, you
get a big old kitchen knife
and stab yourself in the heart.
Blasted “treachery hand”...
This week, you go over to
David Cameron’s gaffe and
give him a good old Baron-
ess Warsi in his Jeremy Hunt.
George Osborne joins in for
a bit of Randy Alexander
while Vince Cables Theresa
May on the couch. Later, Ed
Miliband pops by and fel-
lates the Downing Street cat.
Poor cat...
This week, it’s 4:30am and
you’re in the Library. You hear
a horrific shriek in the dis-
tance and look up from your
books. You’re the only one still
there. You hear hurried steps
amongst the books, coming
closer. You start to get up to
run when you feel a nose on
your neck. The last words you
hear are “BLAARGHGHGH!”
This week, your parents
come to visit. You make them
a cup of tea and return to the
living room to find them blud-
geoning your pet cucum-
ber to death. The cucumber
says, “Leave me! Save your-
self!” You do as he says and
run out into the street crying,
“MY PARENTS WHACKED
MY CUCUMBER...”
This week, you visit the home
of Rector Sir Queef O’Nions.
You get lost on the way to the
bathroom and accidentally
stumble into his bedroom. On
his bed is a book called, “7
Steps to Orgasm” by Joffrey
Baratheon. Sir Queef sudden-
ly enters. Your bloody corpse
is found outside the JCR with
a look of ecstasy on your face.
This week, you become un-
controllably hungry during an
exam. You decide to go for
the guy in front of you. You
leap on him and manage to
eat his ear before you’re sub-
dued by the horrified inviliga-
tors. Worst still, you’re have
to finish the exam without
so much as a sip of water to
wash the ear down..
This week, destiny betrays
you and leaves you for dead.
You’re walking home in the
morning after a sick night
out, when suddenly a man
jumps out of a bin and twee-
zers you in the ass, mortally
wounding you. As you bleed
to death in the morning sun,
you whisper your final, eter-
nal, majestic words... “(yolo)”
This week, you’re fapping
in the Library toilets when
a guy pokes his head over
the cubicle. “Hey”, he says,
“Can I watch?” “Sure”, you
reply, and as you cum you
shit your guts out, pick them
out of the toilet and force
them back in. You look up
at his shocked face and
scream, “YOLO!”
Rector Declares Himself
Queen: Wreaks Havoc
Our Dearest Leader Sir Queef
O’Nions, shocked the nation last
Sunday by brutally murdering the
Queen and then desecrating her
body. He swam across the Thames
in the middle of the Flotilla, climbed
onto the Queen’s Royal Barge and
then proceeded to murder everyone
on board with a flaming hot poker.
He dispatched the Queen with a sin-
gle poke to the groin, before flaying
her with a hunting knife and wear-
ing her skin. He resisted volleys of
sniper fire by hiding behind Prince
Phillip’s limp body and eventually
threw himself into the boat’s propel-
lors shouting “YOLO!” Unfortunate-
ly, none of the horrific events were
televised as the BBC were too busy
interviewing Olympic Torch veteran
will.i.am about his new single “When
John Peel Spins in His Grave”.

Meaning of Irony
College Trumpets Groundbreaking
Research by Academic Who Was
Sacked in Life Sciences Restructure
Last year, the Faculty of Natural Sci-
ences decided, in its infinite scien-
tific wisdom, that research into plant
sciences wasn’t worth Imperial Col-
lege London’s time.
Just one year later, the very same
Imperial College London who told
14 plant and cell biology research-
ers that their academic interests
weren’t in keeping with Imperial’s
research aims, trumpeted the very
same research on the College’s
front page.
The press release is full of gush-
ing press releasey slosh about the
importance of the research, includ-
ing quotes from Dr Gerard Bishop,
who co-led the research. Funnily
enough, the press release fails to
mention that Dr Gerard Bishop was
one of the academics unceremo-
niously made redundant via email
last year. Indeed, one his quotes
puts the nail in the coffin (if more
were needed) of the idea that plant
sciences are unimportant – “the
outcomes of this effort are already
having an impact on the global re-
search effort to deliver better toma-
toes”. In case you doubted the im-
portance of delicious red tomatoes,
the press release helpfully notes
that “tomatoes are one of the most
important fruit crops in the world.”
One of the architects of the re-
structure, Professor Ian Owens, has
long since jumped ship to the Natu-
ral History Museum. But the wreck-

age of his ‘reforms’ is still smoulder-

that the remaining plant sciences

opportunistic press opportunities.
