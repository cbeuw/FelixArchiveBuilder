COMMENT
FELIX Monarchy is outdated
Pietro Aronica
The Union General Meeting was held
last Wednesday to a baying crowd of ap-
proximately twenty interested individuals.
It was unlikely to take incredible prece-
dence in many a calendar across Imperial
due to the stage of term. The low attend-
ance (with 200 required to reach quorum)
was undoubtedly a combination of timing
– with many still remaining in the midst
of exams and revision – a general lack of
publicity, and for want of a better word,
hype.
As difficult as it might be to build up the
enthusiasm at three weeks notice for 200
students to argue it out over a range of
issues, a significant number of students
Felix took the time to question were una-
ware that the General Meeting was actu-
ally taking place on Wednesday.
This is not a huge surprise given the
year-on-year apathy that exists not only at
Imperial but at other universities across
the United Kingdom. What it is, however,
is a shame, as the propositions brought
forward are wide-ranging and are likely
to change the Union significantly if they
come into action. The input from a wider
range of students is likely to be invaluable.
The points raised are definitely worth
your consideration. The Sabbatical Of-
ficer position of Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services) has the potential to be
removed, with the officers’ current more
administrative-focused tasks being as-
signed to permanent staff and allowing
the new emergent role the task of over-
seeing .
Sabbatical Officers will potentially have
the opportunity to hold positions on the
Union’s Trustee Board, which is the sov-
ereign and governing body of the Union.
It acts as the Union’s most powerful com-
mittee and is responsible for its ultimate
objectives and finances. It has been pro-
posed that the addition of Sabbatical Of-
ficers will reduce the President’s overall
power, but what is your view on this?
You may see some aspects of the intro-
duction of a Postgraduate Sabbatical, for
example, as necessary or unnecessary
accordingly.
The points of discussion at the Union
General Meeting will now move to Union
Council on Monday 11 June. If you have
any opinion at all on the issues at hand, it
is recommended that you raise any such
opinion here, before the propositions are
either passed or rejected. The meeting is
open to any student, and you have the po-
tential at this meeting to make the differ-
ence in the future of the Union.

Maybe you don’t want the monarchy to exist when it’s his time to be King, but we can all
agree that his hat is straight-up boss, just sayin’...

f you’ve been in the country for
the past month or so, you un-
doubtedly will have heard about
the Queen’s Jubilee and the great
festivities that accompanied it.
National holiday, extended weekend,
parades and lots of flag-waving to cel-
ebrate the monarch’s sixty year reign.
One thing that I was taken aback by
was the scale of the whole thing; not
by the lavishness and pomp, as I was
expecting that considering how proud
and wealthy this kingdom is and has
been, but rather by how much every-
one participated in the affair. As the na-
tion ground to a halt, Union Jacks were
flown everywhere and thousands if not
millions gathered to celebrate across
the globe. Faraway, and otherwise un-
related, countries covered the jubilee
in great detail and everyone seemed to
participate in wishing the Queen well.
My Facebook feed constantly showed
messages of support. My cynical side
is quick to explain how this widespread
approval might be motivated by the
four-day holiday, but that aside, the cel-
ebrations seemed very earnest.
The monarchy, it appears, is very
beloved. Not only does it still enjoy
support, but it’s thriving, if the popular
participation in events such as the Jubi-
lee and the Royal Marriage last year is
of any indication; which is all the more
jarring considering how outdated as a
concept it is, and how it is a reminder
of harsher times. The monarchies we
have today are the direct descendants
of those that were born in the Middle
Ages or prior. The spirit of unwarranted
social elitism that they embodied for
centuries is still present, though scaled
down, and they have survived cultural
changes that should have spelt the end
of a ruling class decided by inheritance.
Being a king or queen or duke or em-
peror is, obviously, no longer the same
it used be: most have no real power,
and their only official duties consist of,
mainly, waving to crowds and inaugu-
rating buildings and such. But they are
still present: their prerogatives almost
abolished, their role lessened, their
power given to others, but they are still
there. Isn’t this mostly ceremonial func-
tion a sign that monarchy is a relic of
the (bad) past, one who we cling to out
of sheer tradition?
Long gone is the age when being king
actually meant something, when na-
tions would go to war to avoid someone
being crowned and the will of a mon-
arch could make or unmake its coun-
try’s fortunes; one can hardly argue in
favour of that state of affairs. A single
individual’s whims and desires have
caused tragedies and conflicts more of-
ten than they have been beneficial, and
it should be apparent that hereditary
succession is a poor choice for heads
of state; but once we realise that, why
do they still exist? Surely, the advent
of republicanism and our progress as a
civilisation should have been the end of
all kings, but not only do many coun-
tries still have monarchies, they are
very proud of it too.
Tradition, as already mentioned, is
probably the main reason behind this: I,
myself, am not insensible to the rich and
interesting history of the British King-
dom, but I still feel it belongs, because
of this, in the history books. Monarchy,
not only as a form of government but
even as an ideal, is outdated. In its mod-
ern vestigial form it is still a reminder
of how, for centuries, the rights and pre-
rogatives of few could trump and over-
rule those of many. The closely related
concept of aristocracy thrives with it,
creating a ruling class that derives its
power from itself. And while, thank-
fully, this has been vastly changed,
the idea still exists and permeates our
culture. The celebrations for the jubilee
are a reminder of how, despite massive
social changes and greater equality, the
greatest honours are still reserved for
those born with the right set of parents.
There are other arguments against
monarchy. Notably the expense of
maintaining it – though I don’t want to
touch upon that. The discussion would
be just a finicky number war, and I’m
not convinced a republic would be sig-
nificantly cheaper. I prefer to concen-
trate on the cultural impact of still hav-
ing a monarch as head of state, which
is at odds with the meritocracy that our
society is supposed to be founded upon:
it gives undue honour and power; it pro-
motes an archaic vision of the country
as an extension of the monarch, rather
than as a nation of citizens; it is a col-
lection of old habits and traditions that
no longer make sense in a modern con-
text.
While discussing this with friends, the
prevailing sentiment was that “the mon-
archy doesn’t actually do anything”,
and hence it is harmless to society; but
a monarchy is born as institutionalised
class division, and even mangled and
diminished, many of its aspects are still
present. That we still cheer and cel-
ebrate it shows how our culture hasn’t
managed to outgrow this anachronism.
