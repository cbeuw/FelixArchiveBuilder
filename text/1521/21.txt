MacLaine’s AFI glory
The Turning Point (1977)
MacLaine started off her
showbiz career as a dancer
before turning to acting, and
so the cut-throat, ruthless bal-
let world would not have been
a strange world to dive into. In
this story of love, jealousy, am-
bition and unfulfilled dreams,
a mixture which can lead to
disastrous, explosive conse-
quences, MacLaine plays the
talented dancer who gave it
all up for having a family. It so
happens her daughter is now
being trained by one of her ex-
rivals, Anne Bancroft. A bitter
feud ensues, in which bottled
up feelings and resentment
from the past resurface, lead-
ing to intense confrontations,
and at one point, a physical
fist-fight. MacLaine is heart-
breakingly effective as some-
one who could have had it all.
Postcards from the Edge
(1990)
Here we get the chance to
see the lighter, more musical,
funnier side of MacLaine: an
actress so wonderfully gift-
ed that she can pull off just
about anything. She sings,
she dances, she screams,
she gets drunk, she crashes
her daughter’s (Meryl Streep)
car, but ultimately, she makes
us laugh. As a has-been,
washed-up star of the 50s
and 60s, MacLaine is given
the role of taking care of her
recovering addict actress
daughter. Never quite knowing
how to adjust to a less glamor-
ous and glitzy life of a faded
Hollywood star, she spends
her days criticising her daugh-
ter, drinking, hosting shambol-
ic parties, and oh yes, even
more drinking.
The Children’s Hour
(1961)
Martha (Shirley MacLaine)
likes Karen (Audrey Hepburn).
They are teachers in a school,
and they’re the best of friends.
But are they too close for the
60s? After a bitter, resentful
student starts an unfounded
yet highly damaging rumour
about the relationship the two
of them share, their worlds
come crashing down, more so
for Karen who has a fiancé.
It’s a heartbreaking tale of
forbidden love and conserva-
tive ideas, played with warm
sincerity and heart by the two
charming leads. It’s MacLaine
who has the more challeng-
ing role given her character’s
more ambiguous emotions,
and her carefully restrained
performance makes the bold
ending all the more tragic.
Terms of Endearment
(1983)
This film itself is an overlong
soap opera full of forced
tears and heavily nostalgic
moments, and it’s true it
should not have won the Best
Picture Oscar in 1984. But
MacLaine herself gives the
performance of her career, as
an over-bearing, protective, of-
ten suffocating mother whose
only real crime is looking out
for her daughter. They argue,
they fight, she doesn’t like her
son-in-law, she’s judgemental,
passive-aggressive, all in the
name of wanting what is best
for her daughter. Then can-
cer enters the picture for the
daughter, and the weepy fest
goes even crazier with clichés
and long, sad speeches. It’s
a real downer this one, saved
only by MacLaine’s presence.
Bernie (2011)
This excellent dark comedy
debuted at the BFI London
Film Festival but is yet to be
given a proper, full release.
The format of the film, a semi-
documentary dramedy set in
the southern parts of America,
must make this a tough sell,
but with Jack Black’s faultless,
highly enjoyable performance,
Matthew McConaughey’s laid-
back, sleazy legal prosecutor,
and a frighteningly convincing
performance as a lonely, pos-
sessive old lady who no-one
likes by MacLaine, Bernie is
an unexpectedly hysterical
and touching dramedy about a
funeral director with a heart of
gold, with a murder thrown in
for excitement. Curious? You
should be, and if/when this
film is released, be amazed by
Black on career-best form.
