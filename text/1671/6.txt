Two right-wing parties
are expected to take a
combined 58% of the
vote share in Austria’s
upcoming elections.

I
n the wake of a con-
troversial presiden-
tial election which
saw independent
candidate Alexander Van
der Bellen assume power
last January, Austria is
holding a parliamentary
election this Sunday.
In spring the parliament
unanimously decided to
hold early elections, after
the two governing parties,
the social democratic So-
zialdemokratische Partei
Österreich (SPÖ) and the
conservative Österreichis-
che Volkspartei (ÖVP),
concluded that they could
no longer work together
due to major disagree-
ments on policy matters.
Since then the political
environment in Austria
has changed drastically.
The Green Party for-
mally expelled its youth
organisation after a
falling out with its leading
members. At a national
Green Party congress in
June, founding member
Peter Pilz, famous for
uncovering numerous
scandals among previous
governments, lost his
place on the list of Green
Party parliamentary can-
didates. As a result, he left
the party and formed his
own organisation called
Liste Pilz, with which he
is now running for par-
liament. In an interview
with Austrian national
broadcaster ORF, he said
he hopes to provide an
alternative for non-voters
and protest-voters, who
feel unsatisfied with the
current state of affairs.
The ÖVP has also
undergone change. After
the resignation of Rein-
hold Mitterlehner as head
of the party last spring,
foreign minister Sebastian
Kurz took control of the
ÖVP. As foreign minister
he gained popularity in
recent years for closing
the Balkan route (the main
route for refugees coming
to Europe in 2015). He
aims to transform the
image of the ÖVP, by
attempting to deprive old,
established party members
and functionaries of power
and changing the party’s
colour from black to tur-
quoise.
A poll by the Market
Institut predicts an ÖVP
win with 33% of votes.
The right-wing nationalist
freedom party FPÖ comes
second with 25%. The
Social Democrats with
current chancellor Chris-
tian Kern as their candidate
have fallen to 23% from
27% in just one week as a
consequence of a scandal
involving a smear cam-
paign against Kurz. Kern
has denied knowledge of
two Facebook pages that
discredit and insult Kurz,
despite the involvement
of former SPÖ election
adviser Tal Silberstein in
setting them up. Liste Pilz
is estimated to get 6% of
the votes, followed by the
neoliberal NEOS and the
Green Party with 5% each.
It is hard to say whether
these predictions will
prove accurate. Some
experts still see the SPÖ
as a candidate for second
place. In any case the
stage is set for an exciting
election on Sunday in
Austria.
