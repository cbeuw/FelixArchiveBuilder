Cuba Libre: What’s more to achieve than
revolution?
Behind the Facebook-ready vistas and the vintage cars, there’s an unsettling truth at the heart
of Cuban society and politics.

O
n returning from
my holiday to
Cuba this year,
I immediately
got to work making a
shiny new photo album
for all those Facebook
friends out there who’d
probably rather I didn’t.
Revolutionary Square is
in there, lots of palm trees,
and even that most cliché
of images: a hollowed-out
pineapple with a straw in
it – as to indicate this is
no ordinary pineapple.
All very picturesque – as
Cuban as it gets. However,
as is always the case with
social media snaps, the
album is an airbrushed
portrayal of my holiday
and by extension of Cuba.
Much like Raul Castro and
Fidel before him, I make
sure you only see the best
bits.
What we actually saw
beyond the hotel was
a country unchanged
for decades. A place so
steeped in nostalgia it
never thought to look
forward. And amidst the
smiling faces there was
the sense that not all is
right in paradise.
Away from the ears
of hotel managers, our
guide explained to us
how Cold War-era ra-
tioning is still in place
for Cuba’s residents.
One chicken leg per
month, no beef – that’s
only for tourists. To kill
a cow illegally results
in the same penalty as
murder, the resources are
that scarce. He went on
to talk about the colour-
ful classic cars – a result
of ancient economic
sanctions which made
buying new cars virtu-
ally impossible. They’re
not just a quirky feature,
they’re a reminder to
residents of the stagnant
economy.
The next day we were
driven to Havana in
one of these old relics,
accompanied by another
member of hotel staff –
presumably so that we
didn’t stray too far from
the tourist routes. He told
us about how wonderful
Cuba is, how awful
England sounds, and
why it’s not so bad that
he can’t leave the island.
After a bit more probing
on this unexpected
remark he elaborated:
apparently Cuba does
not permit its residents
to leave unless they are
going for business or
another official reason;
even then there’s no
help them go on holiday,
see family elsewhere in
the world, or simply to
escape to a new life.
To escape is the last
thing most sun-worship-
ing, white sand-chasing
tourists think on arrival
to Cuba. But as a resident
it’s easy to understand
why: aside from their
lack of freedom Cubans
must contend with the
crumbling buildings and
infrastructure; the state
owned TV channels,
the restricted wifi and
internet access; old cars
spewing out god knows
what, choking up the
streets. Their world
famous health care is
remarkable considering
the limited resources,
but even in this depart-
ment there lie problems,
with foreigners and Raul
Castro’s inner circle
using one set of facili-
ties and everybody else
having to use another.
Here you get the
sense that the world is
passing by and people in
Cuba are helpless to do
anything about it. GDP
was down 0.9% in 2016
and yet the communist
government still loosens
its tight control on the
markets at a snail’s pace.
Out of a population of
11.1 million only 38.8%
have access to internet,
meaning the majority of
the population are out of
the loop with any current
affairs not broadcast
by biased state-owned
media. As a result of such
restrictions Cubans are
stuck in the 1960’s, both
economically and psy-
chologically, while the
nothing changes.”
Some will always
uphold Cuba as a social-
ist model of fairness and
liberation from the cap-
italist machine. Maybe
I’m wrong in saying
it’s not. People in Cuba
are equal, I suppose.
Equally down-trodden,
equally frustrated – frus-
trated by the poverty, the
decay, the stagnation.
But above all by their
lack of freedom, the
acquisition of which
will always outshine
monetary equality as a
human need. After all,
have you ever heard of
an inmate satisfied with
life behind bars because
of uniform portion sizes
in the canteen? I doubt
it, even if their prison is
a tropical paradise.

“Amidst the
smiling faces
there was the
sense that not
all is right in
this tropical
paradise”
rest of us surge forward
into the 21st century. The
Castros live on, and so
too does the feeling that
there is nothing more to
achieve than revolution.
The leaders are compla-
cent (in everything but
guarantee you will be
allowed to go. First a
letter from the travellers
host is required – fee
$128. Then permission
from their work place
is needed, and finally
and there’s an exit fee –
$150. The success of this
process is very much hit
and miss, with applica-
tions often denied and
the money collected by
the government anyway.
To increase chances of
success many of the hotel
staff had sponsorship
from the hotel guests to
“People in
Cuba are
equal. Equally
down-trodden,
equally
frustrated by
the poverty”
keeping control). Or, as
our guide put it: “Raul
is the same as Fidel –
