Men are catching up
with women when it
comes to discussing
theirmentalwellbeing,
according to data
analysed at Imperial’s
Data Science Institute.

T
he Duke of
Cambridge vis-
ited Imperial’s
Data Science
Institute (DSI) to see
the impact of Heads
Together, a mental health
initiative championed by
the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge and Prince
Harry. The duke also
announced a £2 million
investment fund to use
technology to improve
mental health.
Imperial’s Data Obser-
vatory was used to display
the results of an analysis
carried out by the DSI
on 14,000 responses to
YouGov surveys relating
to mental health. The
study found that from
February to May 2017 –
the period in which Heads
concluded. The students
are aware their behaviour
was inappropriate and
have been sanctioned as
well as warned of the
increasing consequences
of any future misconduct.
Our members are ambas-
sadors of the Union and
College and we expect
them to uphold our values
Hockey players warned to “conduct yourself in an
appropriate manner”
at all times.”
A College spokesper-
son told Felix: “Imperial
College Union has very
clear policies and rules in
place regarding the behav-
iour of all members of its
clubs and societies. Any
breach of these policies
and rules is taken very
seriously by the College
and the Union, and dis-
ciplinary action will be
taken where necessary. As
a result of allegations of
misconduct by the ACC
Men’s Hockey and ACC
Men’s Rugby clubs, the
Union suspended several
committee members of
both clubs pending inves-
tigation into the incident.
Following the outcome of
this, action has been taken
by both clubs. Those
suspended have now been
reinstated.”
ICHC describes itself as
“one of the most success-
ful London college hockey
clubs in recent years”.
They have four men’s
teams, two women’s
teams, and a mixed team.
It was among the most
popular sports clubs at
Imperial last year, with
over 100 members.
Harlington Sports
Ground is located near
Heathrow Airport. It
consists of a number of
sporting facilities, includ-
ing rugby and football
pitches, AstroTurf fields,
and cricket squares. It is
used by student and staff
at Imperial, as well as
members of the public.
QPR FC have used the
ground since 2005, when
they took it over from
Chelsea Football Club.
The College claims that the
partnership has “brought
great benefit to Imperial
students through access
to QPR FC’s professional
coaches”. Money received
from a gravel extraction
operation at the Harling-
ton playing fields led
to the foundation of the
Harlington Trust in 1989,
which grants funding to
clubs, up to the total value
of £50,000 a year.
Felix reached out to
ICHC and ACC Men’s
Rugby, but both were
unavailable for comment.

Together was most active
– there was a rise in the
number of people talking
about their mental health.
The proportion of women
talking about their mental
health increased from
52% to 61%, and for men
it increased from 45%
to 60%, narrowing the
gender gap. The change
represents an increase in
1.2 million men speaking
about their mental health.
There was also a more
gradual increase in people
talking about mental
health in general, with a
3% rise over the same time
period. Charities partnered
with Heads Together all
reported a rise in people
contacting them. These
data indicate a “signifi-
cant change” in attitudes
to mental health. Most
respondents surveyed said
they would talk to a friend
or family member about
their mental health and
a quarter would consult
their doctor. However few
felt comfortable discuss-
ing their mental health at
work. Heads Together will
now specifically focus on
the workplace, the mili-
tary, and men, who make
up 75% of suicides.
The duke said: “We
were trying to understand
why people weren’t
sharing their problems.
If we’ve made a big
impression there, we can
work on the wider societal
aspects.”
He added: “These
individuals who have
spoken have probably got
a reasonably good support
network. Are we missing
a whole set of people
who have had very bad
experiences at young ages
[or] bad mental health
already?”
Imperial president Pro-
fessor Alice Gast said: “It
was an honour to welcome
Prince William to Imperial
and to collaborate with
the Royal Foundation to
produce this important
evidence for the Heads
Together campaign.
“Imperial excels at
multidisciplinary research.
Our mathematicians,
computer scientists, data
scientists, and public
health experts identified
and presented key trends
using the forefront
analysis and visualisation
technology in our Data
Science Institute’s Data
Observatory,” she added.
Heads Together was
founded in February last
year, and has partnered
with eight mental health
charities, including Mind
and CALM. The campaign
has shown celebrities
discussing their mental
health, as well as a TV
series following mentally
ill people running the
London Marathon. The
Duke of Cambridge and
Prince Harry have both
recently spoken of their
mental health following
the death of their mother,
Diana, Princess of Wales,
20 years ago.
