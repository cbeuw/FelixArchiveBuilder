A
s Freshers’
F o r t n i g h t
comes to an
end, we can
say an official goodbye
to summer – in other
words, the brief heatwave
in June and the sporadic
sunshine since then (for
those of us who spent
the summer holidays in
London) – and a reluctant
hello to autumn. However,
as the daylight gradually
vanishes and the ground
becomes littered with
shades of red and brown,
we must remember that
the end of summer is not
all doom and gloom. It’s
time to forget salads and
light lunches, and instead,
bring on the comfort food.
Nothing says warm and
cosy like soup. Especially
for those of us with dry
throats at the moment due
to freshers’ flu, which, for
the record, does not ex-
clusively affect first years.
The classic Heinz tomato
soup is all well and good.
But if you want to try
something a bit different
for a change, try swapping
your fancy Pret A Manger
avocado-and-something
sandwiches for one of
their soups of the day.
They offer a nice mixture
of flavour combinations
for vegetarians, which are
far more interesting than
just tomato, such as kale,
lentil and roasted spices.
They also have meat
varieties , such as red Thai
chicken and veg, which
should appeal to those that
are so inclined and make a
nice change to overused
cream of chicken soup.
One pot dishes also
come to mind when I think
of comfort food. Investing
in a slow cooker would
save you lots of time. Just
chuck all the ingredients
into it in the morning and
voila, as if by magic (but
“We must
remember
that the end of
summer is not
all doom and
gloom”
actually by super organ-
isation), your delicious
dinner is ready for you
when you return home
after lectures. Your hall/
flatmates will be jealous of
your time-saving strategy
and likely be equally
surprised and confused
by the unusually pleasant
smell when they stroll into
the kitchen. You could try
making a hot pot, stew,
or even a curry in a slow
cooker or saucepan.
My favourite one pot
dish has got to be chilli
con carne though. I usually
cheat and buy a flavour
packet from a supermarket
rather than all the separate
spices. Maybe one day
I will truly commit and
make it all from scratch.
But in the meantime, I
think not. If you lack the
time or inclination to cook
it yourself, you could
always opt for chilli on
your baked potato in the
Library Café. Adding
cheese is also a good
shout if you can spare the
extra pennies. My Old
Dutch, a fantastic pancake
house with branches all
over London, including
Kensington High Street
and King’s Road, offer
a pancake with a mini
mountain of chilli con
carne on it, plus nachos
and guacamole on the
side – always welcome
additions in my opinion. I
can highly recommend.
So the take home
message here is simple. If
you find yourself stress-
ing about a lab report or
panicking about leaving
the lecture theatre with no
understanding of what just
happened, sit down, put
on your slippers, and eat
some comfort food.
