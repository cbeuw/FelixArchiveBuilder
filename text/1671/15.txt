Weird music

Beck brings all the colours

ootwork is no
longer confined
to underground
venues in the
South Side of Chicago.
The twisted style of
house music has evolved
to become a muse for
electronic music pro-
ducers across the globe,
infecting deep into the
rosters of prominent UK
labels such as Hyperdub
and Planet Mu. This ex-
pansion of the genre is no
more apparent than when
listening to this latest
release from 20-year-old
Irish producer Iglooghost.
Neō Wax Bloom
blends frantic, synco-
pated footwork rhythms
through grime, bass, RnB
and pop. Although this
collage of sounds reads
like a complete mess, it
provides a surprisingly
uniform product, making
it unsurprising that the
album was released on the
label of wonky pioneer
Flying Lotus. Soulful
vocal samples and sparkly
synth lines neatly weave
between hard kicks and
deep bass, perhaps best
heard on ‘White Gum’: a
160BPM+ grime banger
which ends in a particu-
larly uplifting breakdown.
The grime-influenced
tracks in general tend to
stand out on the album.
Pitch-shifted rapping
becomes just another in-
strument in the onslaught
of sine-waves and dirty
kicks washing over you.
On the more pop and
RnB influenced tracks
an undeniable Asian
influence shines through.
Tracks contain scattered
string plucks and vocal
samples, reminiscent of
the productions of Japa-
nese Shibuya-kei artists
such as Cornelius. ‘Infinite
Mint’ utilises layers of
breathy vocals and bursts
of percussion to make
something both loud and
intimate. Although, within
this intense maximalism
lies the albums downfall.
Sometimes the footwork
skeleton of a song is so
obscured in overdubs
the music starts to feel
fussy and robotic. This
is particularly true on the
frenzied outro ‘Göd Grid’.
Despite this, the
album presents a riveting
collection of wonky-foot-
work. In a genre full of
young and ambitious
producers, Iglooghost has
undoubtedly distinguished
himself from the crowd.
B
eck is the
chameleon of
pop music. You
want a ballad?
You want a rocking guitar
solo? You want a funky
dance song? Beck does it
all with exceptional ease.
And with new album
Colors out today (13th
October), Beck returned
to the capital to play a
secret intimate show at
London Bridge’s Omeara
last Sunday for an ‘All
the Colors Live’ show,
announced at 1pm on the
day. Despite the adver-
tising, Beck did not play
Colors in full, but he did
play all those aforemen-
tioned styles, and more.
Opening with an intro-
spective ballad section,
taken mainly from 2014’s
Morning Phase, the crowd
was hushed, listening
intensely to Beck and his
extremely accomplished
band. In his jet-lagged
state, he mentioned that
this would be the most
“Mumford moment” we’d
be getting, referencing the
fact that Omeara is owned
by one of the members
of Mumford and Sons.
However, this was nothing
like Mumford; this was
not folk for stadiums,
this was folk for each
individual in the room.
He playfully interacted
with the audience, like a
preacher, between songs.
He showed support for
Bono in the face of people
shouting “Fuck U2!” in
relation to his recent sup-
porting stunt with the
band and expressed
his dislike for the
word “lit” (he much
prefers “wowzer”).
Later on, the big
hits came thick and
fast and the party
really took shape:
‘Devil’s Haircut’,
‘Black Tambourine’,
‘Dreams’, ‘E-Pro’, and
‘Loser’, to name but a
few. Beck’s music is part
nise. ‘Devil’s Haircut’
hit hard and the crowd
responded with manic
jumping and screaming.
The temperature in the
room rose significantly,
and didn’t drop for the
rest of the show’s dura-
tion. During ‘Dreams’,
the band gently slowed
down the song slightly
but this did nothing
to stop the crowd
singing the backing
vocals so loudly that
the band were visibly
taken aback, not
least bassist

Moore, whose face
suggested he was rather
impressed with the re-
ception. There was even
time for some rarities
with ‘Nausea’, which got
its first live performance
since 2012, and newbie
‘Up All Night’, performed
for the very first time.
And with the final “I’m a
loser baby so why don’t
you kill me”, it seemed
like it was all over.
Returning for one last
song, ‘Where It’s At’, the
instrumentalists showed
all their prowess as Beck
introduced them one-by-

snippets of other famous
songs such as ‘London

was over. People laughed,
people cried, people sang
and people danced.

Sunday evening;
a perfect concert.

Colors is
out today.
