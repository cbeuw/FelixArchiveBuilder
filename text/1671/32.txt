n today’s elite aca-
demic institutions
and high-performing
workplaces, sleep
is often downgraded to
a status of secondary
importance. The thrill of
instant gratification takes
precedence over the dull
and laborious wait that
inevitably precedes the
onset of sleep. When time
is limited, our attention be-
comes a commodity – and
it is this commodification
that has heralded in the era
of ubiquitous computing.
Saying “yes” to our smart-
phone is saying “no” to
sleep. Chronic sleep loss
is commonplace in today’s
society, yet even among
the brightest of individu-
als, we are unaware of the
potential health effects of
habitual sleep restriction.
In 2015, the American
Thoracic Society heavily
emphasised the impact
that good quality and
quantity of sleep could
have on our physical and
mental health along with
overall quality of life.
The researchers suggest
that a lack of sleep could
result in decreased focus
and health issues, among
many other problems.
At the back of our
minds we know that
the well-known maxim
‘quality over quantity’
holds true in the case of
optimising productivity
and enjoyment. Scientific
literature over the years
has shown that we lose
self-awareness when
sleep-deprived; whilst
we might think we are
being hyper-productive
through virtue of spending
more time on an activity,
in reality we become
biologically impaired and
fall victim to Parkinson’s
law – where an activity
fills the time we have set
aside to complete it.
We all have experiences
where we know this to
be true: during one group
project, we ended up
pulling an all-nighter.
Having begrudgingly
agreed to stay late for a
group project, initially
there was enthusiasm
and excitement. This was
short-lived. The remainder
of the session consisted of
typing, on average, three
words per hour. We missed
the submission deadline.
Sleep is a natural period of
rest for the mind and body
and one that is essential
to our lives. Perhaps the
outcome would have been
different had we realised
this.
Mild sleep-deprivation,
when appropriate, is
often necessary and can
be temporarily overcome.
Polyphasic sleep, the
practice of sleeping at set
times throughout the day
in order to cut down on
total hours slept, can help.
Drugs that help us fend
off sleepiness – mainly
caffeine – have become
pervasive in society.
However, for most people,
developing a habit of sus-
taining enough sleep for
their genetic disposition
will help individuals live
fuller lives. Lives that fill
their internal barometers
for the aspects of life that
matter most: health, work,
love and play.
It is not enough to know
that sleep is important;
action to support this fact
is required. In our micro-
the importance of sleep
hygiene and sleep itself.
Benefits are wide-ranging,
an example being that
eating habits and weight
control are better when
we are not overtired. It is
something that we believe
could be achieved with
relative ease.
Our Sleep Imperial
campaign hopes to trans-
form the way you perceive
sleep and improve your
general wellbeing. In the
meantime, set a caffeine
curfew – cut the caffeine
prior to 6pm. Black it out
– keep your electronics
away from your bed, and
turn off all unnecessary
light around your room to
maximise sleep quality.
Meditate for 10-15
minutes prior to sleep, or
listen to some Autono-
mous Sensory Meridian
Response (ASMR) re-
cordings – this will calm
your body and prepare you
for sleep.
Keep an eye out for
further tips at Sleep
Imperial events around
campus later this year
starting with our launch
event at midday on 13th
November 2017 in the
Chaplaincy.
Campaigning for a
better Imperial
E
arlier this year when I ran to become
your Campaigns Officer, I spoke
about the ways in which previous
campaigns have changed the very
fabric of the Imperial that we know and love.
I referenced the way in which we lobbied for
quality affordable accommodation for all our
students, and for free universal healthcare
coverage for our international student
community – success or failure, over the years
there have been many excellent campaigns
that have had a profound impact on our
university experience.
What I did not highlight in great detail
was the scope for improvement at Imperial
– improvement that only effectively-run
campaigns can deliver for the student body. It
is my hope that the rapidly-changing campus
culture, partly driven by changes in senior
College and Union leadership, will sustain a
drive towards more active engagement with
campaigns from a greater cross-section of
the entire student body. My priority this year
is to support the student body to not only
initiate campaigns, but to follow-through and
successfully execute them in a meaningful
way, beneficial to the organisers – in a
personal and professional manner – and the
wider community. To provide a case study of
what we want to achieve: this year, others and
I will be pushing forward the Sleep Imperial
campaign, which aims to enhance student
health, productivity and satisfaction.
WecanlookforwardtowhatIbelievewillbe
an exciting year for campaigns.The difference
that we can make as a collective is on a scale
that, individually, we can only dream of.
