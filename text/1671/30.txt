It’s time for Autumn food – but what does that mean?
W
hen we
d e c i d e d
to make
this an au-
tumn-themed food edition,
I hadn’t realised that I am
not sure what autumn
food is. And despite the
world being in love with
pumpkin this season – and
by this I mean pumpkin
spice latte – I feel like the
only thing that deserves
to be mentioned is the
pumpkin pie. But let’s
face it, no one has time
to make an absolutely
delicious pumpkin pie. So,
after some brainstorming,
I decided that the only
other food thing related
to autumn that is worth
mentioning, is game.
Yes, you’ve heard me
right! Probably most
people are not even
aware that autumn is
game’s season, but I think
you might want to give
something different a try.
I know you haven’t been
• 4 partridges
• salt
• pepper
• 1 tbsp olive oil
• 1 tbsp butter
• 100 ml Cognac
• 100 ml chicken stock
• 4 shallots
• 20 g Juniper berries
• 5 garlic cloves, crushed
• thyme to taste
• lemon juice
• 200 g baby carrots or chopped car-
rots – keep in mind that if you go
for the normal carrots, you’ll need
to cook them more
• 200 g peas – preferably not the
frozen kind
• 1 tbsp butter
• 1 tbsp honey
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and salt and pepper the birds to taste.
2. In a pan, heat the oil and then gently fry the partridges. Remember
to turn them from one side to another from time to time. After 5 min-
utes, add the butter and continue frying them until browned. Move them
in a roasting pan or a tray.
3. In the frying pan, add the cognac and stir gently. Now, you should
make sure that it mixes with the grease and butter – that means that you
shouldn’t have burnt it. If, however, you did, you can gently scratch the
pan. Add the stock and heat on medium power until it’s reduced by half.
Pour the sauce over the partridges.
4. In the same pan, on low heat, sauté the shallots, berries and the gar-
lic for no more than 5 minutes. Add the thyme and then transfer to the
roasting pan. On top, add the lemon juice – try not to pour too much,
ok? Roast for 10-15 minutes, until the meat is easy to pierce with a fork.
After that, you can take it out, unless you want it to be roasted a bit
more – be careful, however! It can get too dry and you don’t want that.
5. For the side dish, boil the carrots and the peas for about 2-3 minutes
in slightly salted water, then drain. In a frying pan (don’t use the one
you used for the meat prep, unless you cleaned it), heat the butter and
then sauté the veggies. Add the honey and the thyme and fry for anoth-
er 5-7 minutes or until golden. Season and add a couple of spoons of
water. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook for a few minutes until
everything is nice and tender.
6. Now you are done! You should finish it in no more than one and a
half hours so, if you think about it, it’s a nice easy quick recipe, isn’t it?
Don’t forget to serve the juices from the roasting pan!
in uni for long enough
to mind eating the same
microwaved food. But you
will at some point, and
then you will want some-
thing new for a change.
So, better save this page
for some inspiration.

I imagine that living in
London provides us with
anything we want, even if
it’s out of season – if we try
hard enough to find it – but
as students, we’d prefer to
spend less. You can totally
do that if you go for game
during its season, and you
should give partridge a
chance. Now, when going
shopping keep in mind
that in the UK you can
find both grey partridge
and red-legged partridge.
For the following recipe, I
recommend using the first
one.
Keep in mind that the
partridge is a small bird
and one will feed only
one person, but because
“Most people
aren’t even
aware that
autumn is
game’s season”
I know you will actually
have a dinner with friends
(there’s no other better
reason to serve a fancy
dinner), I’ll go with the
ingredients amounts for
4 people – for any other
number of guests, you
can do the maths yourself;
after all, you are an
Imperial student
Don’t these leaves make you crave a lovely pumpkin spice latte? // Flickr/Lali Masriera
