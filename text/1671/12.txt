Making it on their own: Barbican Centre’s celebration
of young talent
Just as Jean-Michel Basquiat surrounded himself with artises, the Barbican has put together a day of collaboration
between key players in the London arts scene.

n conjunction with
their retrospective
on the American
artists Jean-Michel
Basquiat – Boom for
Real – last Saturday The
Barbican held Too Young
for What: a celebration of
Basquiat’s legacy and the
youth working in London
today. In the cavernous
halls of the Barbican
Centre, zine makers, short
film directors, poets, and
photographers set up
workshops, encouraging
the public to get involved
and displaying their art.
I made a zine, watched a
short film, and listened
to some poetry. It was
all about collaboration
and identity, which were
themes strongly apparent
in the Basquiat exhibition.
Basquiat left home
when he was 17 and
started his art career as a
graffiti artist in New York
City, a grossly deprived
and bleak city. Graffiti
became popular at this
time (1980s) to brighten
the harsh, brutalist envi-
ronment and leave state-
ments of protest. Basquiat
collaborated with a school
friend Al Diaz to create
the graffiti tag SAMO©.
Their graffiti was unusu-
ally poetic and became
the talk of New York’s
artistic circles. Eventually
when the duo’s identities
“Basquiat
formed a
community
around a close-
knit group of
artists”
“Jacob Sam-La
Rose is trying
to promote
the idea that
absolutely
anyone can
write poetry”
were revealed SAMO©
disbanded. Within a few
years, Basquiat’s fame had
grown, leading most from
an unlikely friendship
with Andy Warhol whom
he met by selling him
three handmade postcards,
each for a dollar. During
his life, tragically cut short
by drugs, Basquiat formed
a community around a
close-knit group of artists
who would gather to party,
play New Wave music and
make art.
This spirit of entrepre-
neurship and working with
a range of contemporary,
unusual media, creating
spaces was at the centre
of Too Young for What,
in which attendees, par-
ticularly young people,
were encouraged to get
involved in making art.
In one of the rooms,
Holly Casio was running
a workshop on zine-mak-
ing. Casio is an artist who
roots in pop culture and
has strong feminist and
queer bias. The latest
feature from her zine is a
warm, educational, and
humorous comic on OCD.
It is illustrated with decep-
tively simply linework,
brimming full of expres-
sion, reminiscent of Nick
Sharatt’s illustrations for
children’s and young adult
fiction such Jacqueline
Wilson’s Tracy Beaker.
Also featured was Jacob
Sam-La Rose, a poet
whose work has now been
featured in some English
A-Level curricula. He lead
a workshop promoting
spoken word emphasizing
the importance of creative
expression and collab-
oration between artists.
Highlighting that the best
work comes from learning
from others and exploring
oneself in relation to one’s
peers. Rose’s connection
to Basquiat was apparent –
he’d written a poem about
Basquiat’s confidence the
young artist had in his
own art. In an age where
young artists are increas-
ingly asked to be their own
promoter and advocate,
Sam-La Rose is trying to
battle the misconception
many young people have
that because of their
background they cannot
succeed in the world of
art, and trying to promote
a the space for people to
develop this confidence
and the idea that anyone
can write poetry.
Not all of the works
featured had direct links
to Basquiat: Grasp the
Nettle, a feature length
documentary made by the
WeAreChange collective
(which is available on
YouTube) concerns a
group of lands rights
activists struggling against
corporations, government,
and police in order to set
up a eco village in an aban-
doned plot in Brentford.
They aimed to be entirely
self sufficient – live liter-
ally off the (National) grid
and survive off food they
collected in supermarket
skips. In doing so they
attempt to create a self-
made community away
from an increasingly
consumerist world, ex-
ploring a rebellion against
the state and modern way
of living. The film shows
how the village soon
attracts outcasts who most
importantly found a sense
of place in this community.
In bringing together the
many facets of Basqui-
at’s work and psyche,
the Barbican created a
successful day that will
hopefully inspire a new
generation of young artists
to believe that they can
build their own commu-
nities and succeed in the
world of art.
