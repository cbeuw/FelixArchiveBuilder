Angel enthralls at Arcola Theatre after Fringe success
I
n London it takes
something special
to be a stand-out
venue. The Arcola
is just that: committed to
diversity and accessibility,
they stage performances
of new and exciting plays,
often fresh from festivals
like Edinburgh Fringe. Its
commitment to diversity
and equality is reflected
in its programme: over its
last season two thirds of
performances have been
led by women and stories
tackling issues of gender
and equality are a key
feature. One such piece,
Angel has just completed
a successful run. Angel
is based on the story of
Rehana, a female fighter
believed to have helped
defend the Syrian town of
Kobane from ISIS in July
2014. Although precious
little is known about the
woman herself, a mytholo-
gy has built up around her
and this play combines the
sparse facts known about
Rehana with the myths
built around her as well
as the true experiences of
many women in Kobane.
The atrocities suffered
by women under ISIS
have been highlighted by
western media, but less
attention has been given
to the women engaged in
the frontlines of defence.
Angel shines a spotlight
on these women and their
role in the conflict.
This play is a one-wom-
an show: actress Avital
Lvova plays Rehana as she
transitions from a young
girl aspiring to be a lawyer
to a legendary sniper,
but this isn’t her only
role. She plays Rehana’s
father, mother, friends and
foes, smoothly switching
between characters. In
some ways Angel feels
almost like one continu-
ous monologue – Rehana
is taking the audience
through her story – we are
right there with her, expe-
riencing every moment.
At times the play is
noticeably unsubtle: early
on in the play, a young
Rehana is bullied and
challenged by neighbour-
hood boys and prevented
from climbing a tree for
being a girl, she is forced
to pretend to be the wife
of a strange man merely
to gain passage, and, at
one point, is captured and
sold as a slave alongside
dozens of other women.
It is clear that Angel
doesn’t just want to tell
Rehana’s story: it wants
to capture the experiences
of the many thousand
women caught in this
brutal conflict. Although
such ambition should be
praised, at times, it makes
the play feel heavy handed
– Rehana’s story feels
almost unreal – she faces
challenge after challenge,
running full tilt through
it all. In the play’s short
running time of one hour
this sometimes feels more
than a little overwhelming.
Other aspects of the
story are much more
nuanced: Rehana’s own
internal conflict is por-
trayed beautifully – she
is angry and desperate,
but also guilty and afraid.
Arguably the best portray-
alofthisisinascenewhere
she shoots down invading
soldiers, narrating the
death of each one: “The
rapist with his nine-year-
old sex slave? Death. The
homesick boy who made a
terrible mistake? Death.”
It is one of the many ways
Angel acknowledges that
the people she is fighting
are not demons: like any
war, this one is multifacet-
ed and there are victims on
all sides.
The staging is intimate.
Arcola’s studio two is a
small space, with Lvova
frequently within arm’s
reach of the audience.
This makes the experience
all the more intense. The
low ceiling, stark lighting
and minimal props con-
tribute to the experience,
a clear demonstration of
just how powerful good
storytelling and acting
can be. ‘Good acting’ may
well be an understatement
when it comes to Lvova’s
performance. She is re-
markable; the one woman
show gives her no breaks
and no one to hide behind.
Her role is physically and
emotionally demanding as
she fills the whole stage,
switching rapidly between
characters and emotions.
Despite all this, she keeps
the audience enthralled
with her performance,
there is no way you can
tear your eyes away from
her Rehana for the full
duration of the play.
Its not difficult to see
why Angel was so well
loved at Edinburgh Fringe
in 2016, achieving a
sold-out run and several
awards. It’s the third of
writer Henry Naylor’s
critically acclaimed
series of plays Arabian
Nightmares and his latest
play Borders premiered at
this summer’s Edinburgh
Fringe and echoed the
success of Angel and its
predecessors. Angel’s
transfer to the Arcola
gave London audiences a
chance to experience this
gem and, although its run
at the Arcola is now over,
it has left a lasting im-
pression on its audience.
The play has been touring
the world in the past year
and, following a sold-out
short festival run, a French
version of the play is now
being performed at the
Theatre Tristan Bernard
until December 30th
.
Further performances are
expected in 2018, and
although any have yet to
be announced, hopefully
a wider UK audience will
soon be able to experience
this unique play.
Whilst we wait,
however, the Arcola’s
upcoming programme
continues to explore the
stories of women often
ignored. Foremost of
these is the currently
showing All the Little
Lights, tackling child
sexual exploitation and the
stories of women and girls
who often slip through the
cracks in society.
A remarkable performance from Avital Lvova lights up the one woman show about the ‘Angel of Kobane’ – the
legendary sniper fighting ISIS in Syria.
