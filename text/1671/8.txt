Why do science when it doesn’t make any
money?
The non-executive board of the UK Research and Innovation has been revealed, and the
implication is clear: make money or get out.

O
ne of our
shortcomings
as a country has
been that whilst
we’re brilliant at primary
research and at scientific
discovery, we’re less suc-
cessful at making the most
of those discoveries for
commercial purposes – at
getting businesses to
actually get in there and
exploit the discoveries
which our scientists are
making,” said the United
Kingdom’s Minister of
State for Universities,
Science, Research and
Innovation, Jo Johnson,
in an interview with The
House earlier this year.
Exploitation of science
a.k.a. innovation, is at the
heart of the UK govern-
ment’s economic policy
and industrial strategy.
This push has manifested
itself in the accumulation
in and of itself; it needs
to make a quantifiable
economic impact. Johnson
qualifies this carefully in
speeches: “Great science
is, of course, important in
its own right, as well as
yielding enormous practi-
cal benefits.” His delicacy
implies how he thinks
we should view science:
fundamental research is
necessary, but we should
focus on its practical
outcomes.
This analysis could
be thrown off as mere
cynicism, but with last
week’s announcement of
the non-executive board of
UKRI, the government’s
plan for research is exactly
what I feared it might be.
The UKRI non-exec-
utive board will play a
critical role in providing
strategic direction and
oversight of research
funding in the UK.
Members of the Board –
who were appointed by
Johnson, and will typical-
ly serve for between three
and five years – include
a number who specialise
in turning science into
an industry: Mustafa
Suleyman is co-founder
and Head of Applied AI
at DeepMind, where he is
responsible for integrating
the company’s technology
across a wide range of
Google products. There
are also academics with
links to big business: our
own President Alice Gast
is, amongst her other
roles, a board member of
Chevron, who “work[s] to
meet the world’s growing
demand for energy by ex-
ploring for oil and natural
gas.” Another important
member is Lord Browne,
who chaired the Browne
Review which recom-
mended the removal of
the student fees cap. He is
emblematic of universities
becoming a business. And
what would a research
funding council be without
an ex-managing director
of an investment bank, Sir
John Kingman.
Through selecting
these board members the
direction UK research will
take is evident: the only
science worth doing is
science that can have an
economic impact. On the
surface this may seem like
a fairly innocuous state-
ment. Indeed, why waste
time and spend taxpayers’
money doing something
that might not be of use to
anyone?
Science can take time
to show how it can be
useful, and some of the
to be no reason to believe
that electricity will be
used as a practical mode
of power.”
Is the UK’s push for
research to be useful in
the here-and-now, in an
economic sense, a step
in completely the wrong
direction? I would heartily
say yes, but what’s more
unsettling is that the trend
isn’t specific to the UK.
Speaking at a European
Research Area conference
in Berlin last year, Carlos
Moedas, the European
Commissioner for
Research, Science and
Innovation said the next
framework programme
for European research
funding, FP9, should have
“a more sophisticated
approach” to impact.
However, it is still yet
to be understood, what
exactly Moedas means
by his comments. Some
believe he wants to rep-
licate the UK’s Research
Excellence Framework,
REF across Europe, but
we will only find out when
the FP9 is developed over
the next year.
The EU “poorly distin-
guishes between research
funding and obsolete
forms of industrial sub-
sidisation”, wrote Peter
Strohschneider, President
of the DFG, a German
research council. He is
highly critical of the UK’s
and the EU’s stance on
impact and believes that
research can only have
true impact when antici-
pated short term benefits
are not allowed to become
the main criterion for
funding decisions.
I side with Strohsch-
neider, for in my eyes the
truth worth of science is
unquantifiable and beyond
any measure of impact.

“Through
selecting this
board, the
message is
evident: the
only science
worth doing is
that which has
an economic
impact”
most remarkable discov-
eries have come out of
looking at something that
first appeared pointless.
CERN management
thought Tim Berners-Lee
was wasting time with his
useless world wide web;
the Nobel-prize-winning
cancer researcher Paul
Nurse stumbled across
a gene for cell division
after watching yeast, and
in 1867, nine years after
Faraday’s death, a meeting
of British scientists pro-
nounced that “Although
we cannot say what
remains to be invented, we
can say that there seems
“Explotation of
science, a.k.a.
innovation, is
at the heart
of the UK
government’s
economic
policy and
industrial
strategy”
of all UK funding councils
into one super-council: UK
Research and Innovation
(UKRI). Science can no
longer survive as a worth-
while human endeavour
