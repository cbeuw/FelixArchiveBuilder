Student System Administrator Roles
We’re looking for up to three students to help out the ICU Systems
team on a casual basis to manage the Student Club, Society and
Project (CSP) web servers.
The time required each week will be small, though we would expect
a regular commitment so we are able to answer and solve requests
within a couple of days. The roles are flexible and the post holders will
be able to work remotely, though we would expect occasional hours to
be performed on site in the ICU office.
