This week you have
freshers flu. Stop calling it
that. your a PhD and you
only went for one pint
during welcome week.
This week you think
it’s a really ballsy move to
go to the RCSU pub crawl
and show people your
testicles. For the love of
god stop.
This week you decide
Bud Light isn’t that bad.
Maybe it’s because you
are at ACC or due to
previous ten pints you’ve
downed. Felix can not be
sure.
This week you return to
Felix to record the latest
episode of Felix’s flagship
podcast unfortunately you
forget to plug in the mic
and record 20 minutes of
silence. This is your most
popular episode.
This week you do all
the things that freshers
do. Unfortunately the
Felix Editor is too old to
remember what these are.
This week you write
a comment piece about
Alice Gast, you think
nothing of it until later
that night you receive a
horse’s head in your bed.
No-one messes with the
Gaster.
This week the
watersport society are
invited to Harlington to
participate in the sports
trials.
This week puzzles,
Felix’s most popular
section, is demoted off
the last page in a cynical
move to drive traffic away
from the sweet sweet
puzzles to stories of union
hackery. Fred Out! SAD!
This week you receive
a fortune cookie which
tells you “the end of the
world is nigh and it’s all
your fault”. You really
should’ve turned up to the
Felix centrefold
This week you are
the Felix Editor. You
just wish people would
stop talking to you about
crosswords.
This week your
chemistry lecturer no
shows amid rumours he’s
in another country. That’s
odd I could swear he was
at the RCSU pub crawl
last night.
This week you get a
free lightsaber with a Jedi
Knight themed cocktail
in Adventure bar. Felix
was not paid for this
endorsement.

Fresher finds next year’s housemates within two weeks
of arriving

Turns out telling
students to “Raise your
Voice” wasn’t a great
marketing strategy
after all
Nega-Felix
Editor-in-Chief
A
fresher from
Eastside has de-
scribed feeling
“relieved” that
she has found a group of
people to live with for
next year so quickly.
Samira Newsom, a first-
year student on the Mate-
rials BSc course, arrived
at Imperial approximately
two and a half weeks
ago. “When I got here on
the first day,” she said, “I
was feeling pretty over-
whelmed, but I’ve already
found a really good group
of friends, and we’re all
going to live together
next year.” Newsom went
on to describe how the
new group were “best
friends”, and explained
that “nothing will ever
come between us – we’re
friends for life!”
The group, which
includes two male and
three female freshers, have
already begun thinking
about places to live: “I
was planning on Ham-
mersmith, because it’s
really close to where my
lectures will be next year,”
Newsom says, “but Claire
wants to live in Dulwich
because it’s cheaper, and
Susan’s boyfriend lives
in Camden, so we might
go further north. I’m sure
we’ll be able to sort some-
thing out where we’re all
happy, and nobody has
any burning resentments!”
However, there were
some concerns among the
group. One member, who
did not wish to be named,
told Felix the following:
“I thought it was going
really well, but then I
was added to a WhatsApp
group called ‘House Back
Up Plan’. I was removed
pretty quickly, but I’m
pretty sure Claire and Phil
were the admins. I’m sure
it’s nothing though.”
Newsom denied any
concerns about the friend-
ship group: “Yeah, we’ve
only really seen each
other when we’re drunk or
hungover, and we’ve never
shared bathrooms, but it’ll
be fine – how messy can
other people be?”
“My friends don’t know
this,” she continued, “but
my parents have actually
begun looking into
putting a downpayment
on a house in Acton. The
gang’s gonna be so excited
when I tell them. Nothing
can possibly go wrong.”
“‘Nothing will
ever come
between
us,’Samira
Newsom says,
‘we’re going to
be friends for
life!”
“There were
concerns: one
member was
added to a
WhatsApp
group called
‘House Back
Up Plan”
