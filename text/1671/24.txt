Saunders explores the limbo between life and death in
debut novel
A fan of Saunders’ short stories, Henry Bennie thought that the transition to a full novel might not be easy,
especially for one so acclaimed in short stories - but he finds that he had nothing to fear.
I
was fearful when I
heard about Lincoln
in the Bardo almost
a decade ago. I’m
not a fan of historical
novels and was aware of
the difficulties that come
with moving from short
stories to novels. My fears
were unfounded, George
Saunders’ first novel is a
triumph. To even call it a
historical novel boxes it
in too tight, even calling
it a novel is restrictive, it
is quite unlike anything I
have ever read before.
The first thing you will
notice upon picking up the
book and flipping through
the pages is how weird it
looks inside. Please don’t
be put off, all will become
clear. The novel is entirely
composed of dialogue and
quotations from historical
texts (some of these texts
are fictitious, but Saunders
could fool even the best
historians).
Both dialogue and
quotations appear in the
same format creating a
large chorus of often con-
tradictory voices. This in
the hands of others would
seem clunky and possibly
just literary bravado, but
the genius of Saunders’
construction becomes
wonderfully apparent at
the climax and is the best
realisation of the plot.
“Even calling
it a novel is
restrictive, it
is quite unlike
anything I
have ever read
before”
The Lincoln of the title
is eleven-year-old Willie
Lincoln, beloved son of
the President of the United
States Abraham Lincoln,
who dies of typhoid fever
20 February 1862. We
follow Willie over a single
night, two days after his
death, in the Bardo. The
Bardo is the ‘intermedi-
ate’ or transitional state
between one’s death and
one’s next birth, according
to Tibetan Buddhism. Here
Willie joins the restless
spirits who are responsible
for much of the novel’s
narration.
“One must be constant-
ly looking for opportu-
nities to tell one’s story,”
explains Hans Vollman,
one of the ghosts, who
like the others, believes
himself not to be dead, but
merely ill, recuperating
after the misfortune that
has brought him to the
cemetery in his ‘sick-cart’
and makes him rest during
the day in his ‘sick-box’.
The ghosts are unsettled
that Willie isn’t moving
onto his next life, like the
young do quickly, he’s
stuck in the Bardo, and
good doesn’t come to
those spirits that tarry.
The novel centres
around the legend that
deep in the midst of
the Civil War Abraham
Lincoln, driven to
madness by grief, visited
the body of his dead child
the night before burial. In
the novel, the visit by his
grieving father agitates
Willie’s spirit, as well as
his graveyard neighbours.
His demonstration of love
calls up all sorts of weird
feelings in the lingering
souls.
“It was cheering. It gave
us hope,” a ghost called
Reverend Thomas says,
“as if one were still worthy
of affection and respect”
even in this debased state.
Another ghost, Roger
Bevins III draws a similar-
ly optimistic conclusion.
“We were perhaps not so
unlovable as we had come
to believe,” he says. If
the spirits can persuade
this boy to undertake his
rightful departure to the
Other Side, they might be
saved as well. It will be a
long night.
The souls of the Bardo
crowd around this uncanny
child. As the cast grows,
so does our perspective;
the novel’s concerns
expand. In the midst of the
Civil War, saying farewell
to one son foreshadows all
those impending farewells
to sons, the hundreds of
thousands of those who
will fall in the battlefields.

Lincoln in the Bardo
by George Saunders
“As the cast
grows, so
does our
perspective”
“The genius
of Saunders’
construction
becomes
wonderfully
apparent at
the climax
and it the best
realisation of
the plot”
As the cast continues to
expand, we see more and
more of life and out of the
voices of the graveyard we
can see a whole country.
Lincoln in the Bardo
“Saunders has
served up the
perfect novel
of the year”
was clearly conceived
before the present circum-
stances, but it is none-
theless inflected with the
tensions we can see today
with the rise of populism.
Saunders has served up
the perfect novel of the
year. It is an all-encom-
passing, exhausting, emo-
tionally involving attempt
to get up again after a fall,
to fight for empathy and to
resist.
The writer notes that
there is also an audiobook
with a cast of 166 people,
including Nick Offerman,
David Sedaris, Julianne
Moore, Lena Dunham, Ben
Stiller, Susan Sarandon,
Megan Mullally and Don
Cheadle giving voice to
plethora of ghosts, which
might be an even better
experience than reading!
With the Man Booker
Prize being announced on
17 October, Felix Books
will be reviewing more
from the shortlist over next
couple of weeks.
