E
very day, many
people travel.
Whether for busi-
ness, studies, or
leisure – the list is endless.
Travel is their living, their
future, or their relaxation,
but why else do people
choose to travel abroad?
There are many
answers, but what I am
looking for is medical
tourism. Now, some of
you may wonder what that
is and others may question
how medicine can relate to
tourism. So let’s start from
the beginning.
The literal part
Different types of
tourism categorize both
the reasons for and the
ways of travelling, as well
as the places people travel
to. For example, there’s
international tourism and
domestic tourism: the first
describes travelling to
another country, while the
second describes travel-
ling to another city/region
within the home country.
In the same way, the term
medical tourism refers
to travelling to another
country for medical
reasons. The Medical
Tourism Association gives
a nice definition of what
exactly medical tourism
is: “Medical Tourism is
where people who live
in one country travel to
another country to receive
medical, dental, and
surgical care while at the
same time receiving equal
to or greater care than they
would have in their own
country, and are travelling
for medical care because
of affordability, better
access to care, or a higher
level of quality of care.”
So if you have an illness
or need emergency health
care that your country is
unable to provide, then
travelling may be the
only choice, and can even
save your life. In this
case, travel is literally
the best, or – more accu-
rately – the only remedy.
The mixture
However, this kind of
tourism doesn’t apply to
emergencies only. Many
countries advertise their
medical expertise, inviting
people for cosmetic
surgeries, physical treat-
ments, and relaxation ther-
apies. Thus, travellers get
a chance to not only expe-
rience the medical benefits
of their trip but also enjoy
the beauty of the place
they’re visiting. In my
opinion, this is a perfect
example where travel can
act as both a literal and
a metaphorical remedy.
The metaphorical part
But there are more
metaphorical aspect to the
term ‘remedy’. Travelling
is known to have a lot
of non-physical benefits,
which indeed are the
driving force for many
people to keep travelling:
you can broaden your
horizons by visiting
countries with a different
culture than yours, getting
a taste of the way the
locals live, communi-
cating with them, trying
the local cuisine, etc.;
you can improve your
communication skills in
a foreign language; you
can fight your fears, for
example, a fear of heights
by travelling by plane,
admiring the view of a
city from a tall building,
climbing a mountain,
doing bungee jumping,
etc.; you can relax on
the beach or exercise by
hiking, cycling, climbing;
you can learn to be more
organized and to manage
your time, so you don’t
miss any important events,
such as flights; you can
either strengthen ties
with the people you are
travelling with or under-
stand yourself better (if
travelling solo); you can
gain confidence by getting
out of your comfort zone;
you can meet new people
by interacting with locals
or other members of your
group if you are on an or-
ganised tour; and last but
not least, you can collect
precious memories (and
many photos)!
So keep travelling –
because it can be a treat,
not only to your body, but
also to your soul!

Travelling can often be a healing experience, but not necessarily in the ways you might think
