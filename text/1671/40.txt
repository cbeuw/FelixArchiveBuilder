A hurling, twirling day of shinty for Gaelic Athletics
Gaelic Athletics try and claw back their old glories in Bottle Match against CSM
I
mperial College
Gaelic Athletics Club
(ICGAC) set out to
take on the Camborne
School of Mines (CSM)
with the aim of reinstating
Imperial Hurling to its
former glory (League
Champions in 2012). The
unofficial Bottle Match
fixture pitted two tradi-
tional Celtic sports, Shinty
and Hurling, against one
another. Imperial were
unlucky to lose 3-1 to 2-0
(which equivalates to 10
points to CSM against 6
points to ICGAC).
The game involved a
mélange of rules from
both sports. Hurling, a
traditional Gaelic sport, is
described as an amalgama-
tion of hockey, lacrosse,
and golf. It is regarded as
the fastest and oldest field
sport in the world and
the ball can travel up to
speeds of 120km/h. Shinty
is a Scottish game derived
from hurling with sticks
which more resemble
hockey sticks than the
Irish ‘hurl’.
The first half saw the in-
experienced ICGAC team
bravely take on the Shinty

team who were armed with
sticks twice the size of our
hurls (hurling sticks). In
the first minute, the Men’s
Captain Lorcán Cropper
had to leave the pitch due
to a battered and heavily
bleeding hand, leaving
the team a man down.
Despite some excellent
hold up play by Alex
Aboud and Beth Hassan,
CSM managed to score 3
goals taking advantage of
their well-rehearsed team
tactics against Imperial’s
still forming team.
ICGAC has, however,
faced worse odds and
survived. The second half
saw a totally rejuvenated
performance where
Imperial came into their
own. A solid defence con-
sisting of Joe Allen and
Nelson Taluker, with Nick
Oon in goal saw off every
challenge CSM could
throw at them. This, along
with the work of merce-
nary Fulham hurler Paul
Mannix, whose end-to-end
passing, tireless running
and total dominance of
the midfield helped to
ensure some pride could
be restored. He and our
own American Sniper,
Eoin Lyons, peppered
the opposition goal with
shots, scoring a goal each.
After the exciting
match, a well-deserved
pint, or two, was had by
both teams at Wether-
spoons. The occasion was
spent reflecting on how
this was fast becoming a
major annual fixture for
both clubs. The ICGAC
Chair, Beth, thanked
CSM and all the dedicat-
ed Imperial players for
dragging themselves out of
Felix is recruiting!

for the match. A special
shout-out was given to
our very own cheerleader
and photographer Sorcha
Begley (out-of-action due
to injury), who captured
some great shots of the
action on the day.
