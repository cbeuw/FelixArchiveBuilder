Fear Factor: Zombie ants
SCIENCE

umans thrive
off fear. Many
put themselves
in situations to
induce a sense of tension,
of being utterly in the
moment, feeling truly
alive; fear is a motivator
for many a near-life ex-
perience, after all. These
instances are fairly regular
occurrences: be it horror
films, deciding autono-
mously to visit Metric
on a Wednesday evening
during Fresher’s Week or,
perhaps for the downright
foolhardy, deciding to visit
once again the week after.
Looking around a busy
tube train filled to the brim
with hordes of commuters,
myself included, momen-
tarily brain-dead to their
surroundings, what better
place to start than with
man’s undead counterpart:
the zombie.
Zombies are a night-
mare, but surely nothing
more than that? Nature is
a wonderful awful thing,
however. There is a para-
sitic fungi capable of com-
mandeering the bodies of
not-long dead ants.
Researchers noticed
that fossilised remains of
leaves bared the hallmarks
of tiny ant bites. These
fossilised leaf remains
date back approximately
48 million years ago and
were found at the Messel
Fossil Pit in Germany.
Independent of this, the
same ant bite marks were
taken from the underside
of leaves in southern
Thailand. As a prior
warning, if you’re an ant,
(not colloquially) as Ophi-
ocordyceps unilateralis,
this fungus modifies the
ant’s behaviour. In some
sense, having been infeced
by the fungus, the ant is
already dead.
Professor Matthew
Fisher from Imperial
College London said
that the fungus appears
to secrete metabolites,
Guanidinobutyric Acid
(GBA) and Sphingosine,
that are “likely involved in
zombifying their hosts” by
hijacking the ant’s central
nervous system. The ant
climbs to approximately
25cm above the forest
floor, biting onto leaves
in the lower canopy,
evidenced for by the scars
seen on leaves in the Rhine
Rift Valley. The fungus
grows as a spine through
the back of the ant’s
head. Once the ant dies,
the spores held within
the spine explode out and
shower onto other ants on
the forest floor, spreading
the infection once again.
The fact that evidence
for this symbiosis exists
through varying different
epochs to the present day
is testament to the tenacity
of the infection. With little
to no protection for the
ants, the only solution
offered by the colony
is to carry off infected
members to avoid colo-
ny-wide infection in what
sounds like a somewhat
less PG sequel to Pixar’s A
Bug’s Life.
OK. OK. I hear what
you’re thinking. This is
pretty creepy stuff, but
there’s a pretty big dis-
tinction between ants and
humans. Tell me when
undead humans can be
parasitically reanimated.
In fact, maybe don’t talk
to me even then.

Fear is one of the driving factors of human behaviour, but not everything we see in horror films is a fantasy. Science
already has a wealth of horrific things, starting with parasitic fungi and moving up to bacterial mind control.

nightmare, but
surely nothing
more than
that?”

may act to maximise the
possibility of transmis-
sion of the parasite to
further hosts. Luckily, the
behavioural effects have
not yet included climbing
into trees to maximise the
efficiency of spreading
infective spores (This is
perhaps something that the
observant reader should
watch out for this Hal-
loween). Professor Fisher,
noticing my distress,
added that “examples of
fungi maximising their
potential for transmission
in higher organisms are,
fortunately, rare”.
While the chances of a
full-blown Walking Dead
style apocalypse may still
be fortunately low, the
possibility of behavioural
modification due to the
presence of parasitic
infections – immensely
interesting and infinitely
sellable to Hollywood
– is still a pretty freaky
prospect.
this next section may make
for some grim reading.
