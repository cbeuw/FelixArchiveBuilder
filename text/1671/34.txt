HANGMAN
Turns out telling
students to “Raise your
Voice” wasn’t a great
marketing strategy
after all

mperial College
Union’s Autumn
Elections have hit a
snag this as nomi-
nations close this week,
following confusion about
the campaign slogan.
Police have had to
be called to the Union
buildings several times
over the past few days, as
Union staff reported noise
complaints. The problem
has arisen due to a mis-
understanding over the
campaign tag, “Raise your
Voice”, which has seen
several students going up
to the second floor and
screaming at the Union
reception.
Witnesses have
reported high-pitched
whining and loud shouting
emanating from the Union
offices, for longer periods
and of greater intensity
than would normally be
expected for this time of
year.
While the Union has
provided its employees
with complimentary ear-
plugs, the noise has had a
significant impact on staff
satisfaction and productiv-
ity. “I was trying to focus
on organising the timeta-
ble for the staff’s massage
therapist – given the stress
of Welcome Week it was
a high-priority task,” ex-
plained one staff member,
“but all the noise was con-
fusing, so now we’ve got
a ball-pit coming instead;
that wasn’t supposed to
get here until next week.”
We spoke to Garth
Lublow, Head of Demo-
cratic Vocal Harmony at
Imperial College Union,
who told Felix: “at the
Union, we want to ensure
that every student’s voice
is heard loud and clear, just
perhaps not this loudly.”
One student told Felix:
“After they stopped me,
they explained the con-
fusion. They told me that
actually their aim was
to raise the profile of the
Autumn Elections, where
I can make an informed
decision about my
representation, and take
part in one of the largest
student democracies in the
country. I think screaming
in the Student Activities
Centre made me feel better
though”.
Seven students have
been arrested by the police
thus far, and have been
charged with disturbing
the peace. Three were at
the building for The Im-
perielles’ open auditions.
“The campaign
tag“Raise your
Voice”has
seen students
going to Beit
and screaming
at the Union
reception”
“At the Union,
we want to
ensure that
every student’s
voice is heard
loud and clear,
just not this
loudly”
Raise your voice! Louder! Louder! No, not that loud. // Thomas Angus
