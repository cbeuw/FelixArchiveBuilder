including a return
N
ormally I don’t find this kind of books
fascinating – I sometimes add them
to my to-be-read (TBR) list, but they
just stay there forever. However, this
book has something… probably the parents
who abandon their daughter in the middle of a
hurricane, the undertone of racism, the tragedy
that is actually unavoidable.
The Floating World claims to be a book about
grief, but in the same time, about so much
more and, honestly, the reason this is on my
TBR list is the mysteries behind Cora who, in the
description, seems to be a magical creature who
has more power of destruction in her family than
the hurricane itself.

and we loved them – or at least,
I did. I know that some people
might claim that it’s time to grow
up and move over children’s fiction, but, oh, you
must admit that Pullman’s books are so much
more than‘for children’.
I must admit that I wasn’t expecting him to
come out with another book set in this universe,
but now I cannot wait to get my hands on it –
ASAP, please! I mean, a book about Lyra, claiming
to explore more about the Dust (for those of you
who don’t remember: elementary particle that
connect humans to their daemon – you should
learn more about it in chemistry lectures!) Oh,
and if you wonder, La Belle Sauvage is the name
of a boat which increases this story’s potential by
at least three times.

The Book of Dust – Volume One La Belle Sauvage, by Philip Pullman

)
O
k, maybe there are too many books on
this list that are just new publications
from authors I’ve read and loved, but
do you remember The Martian? Andy
Weir is great when it comes to setting situations
in space – so great that you start wondering
when did whatever-he-is-talking-about happen
because you missed the news. So, yes, I expect
Artemis – the first and only city on the moon – to
be a very realistic location that will make me start
saving money for my first holiday there, even if it
isn’t the best place if you are not eccentrically rich,
apparently. Yes, some bits of it sound like a cliché,
but I hope it will live to the expectations.
T
he Vegetarian was quite a sensation last
year, wasn’t it? I think everyone was
talking about it at some point and now,
there’s time for another Han Kang book.
If I am to be honest, The Vegetarian was not the
best book in the world, but it was quite interesting
and the way Kang tells the story is quite catchy.
However, the real reason you should look out
for this book has nothing to do with previous
publications, but with its topic. This book tells the
story of an older sister that never actually lived,
as she died soon after birth. I mean, from the
short description I’ve read, this book has a lot of
potential. A lot!
