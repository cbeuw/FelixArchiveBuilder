ccording to a
study published
6th
of October,
75% of global
honey samples were
contaminated with several
neonicotinoid pesticides.
Levels detected are
below the threshold
deemed dangerous for
human consumption. The
report, however, adds
weight to a growing body
of evidence suggesting
that neonicotinoids, like
many pesticides, are
causing long-term harm to
pollinator populations.
Neonicotinoids have
been banned from use
on flowering crops in the
EU since 2013, but this
ban only applies to plants
such as oilseed rape and
to sowing treated seeds
during the spring or
summer. The ban does
not apply in gardens or
to crops such as winter
wheat.
Environmental groups
urged the UK government
to permanently extend the
neonicotinoid restrictions
to all crops and commit
to keeping any ban
post-Brexit. In June, Julie
Girling, a British MEP
from the European Con-
servatives and Reformists
Group, led an attempt to
block the neonicotinoid
ban. Her bid was thrown
out by the European
Parliament’s environment
committee, but is seen by
some observers as being
part of an effort by the
UK’s Conservative Party
to prevent the proposed
ban.
Over 100,000 inverte-
brate species have a role
in pollination and have a
considerable influence on
the production of more
than 150 global food
crops.
However, the most
crucial pollinators to
agricultural crops are bee
species. Over the last few
decades, many pollinator
populations have declined
due to various human-re-
lated pressures. These
include loss of habitat,
intensification of agricul-
ture, a more uniform and
less biodiverse landscape,
Fetishisation of the Nobel Prize continues
R
ainer Weiss,
Kip Thorne, and
Barry Barish re-
ceived the Nobel
Prize for Physics for their
discovery of gravitational
wave: distortions in the
fabric of space and time.
They led the Laser
Interferometer Gravita-
tional-Wave Observatory
(LIGO) project and
helped to make and keep
it a reality. However, the
hundreds of scientists in
LIGO that actually made
the discovery received
none of this recogni-
tion. The Nobel Prize
committee’s refusal to
award prizes to groups or
collaborations is causing
problems and giving a
misleading impression
of how a lot of science is
actually done.
The same issues crop up
all across science. Jacques
Dubochet, Joachim Frank,
and Richard Henderson
won the Chemistry Nobel
Prize for the development
of cryo-electron microsco-
py, which both improves
and simplifies the imaging
of biomolecules, while the
Nobel Prize in Physiol-
ogy or Medicine went to
Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael
Rosbash, and Michael W.
Young for their discoveries
of molecular mechanisms
controlling the circadian
rhythm.
The Nobel Prizes
repeatedly pedestalise a
select number of scientists
as deities, meanwhile
others who may have
had an equally important
role are eliminated from
history.
As if by some strange
occurrence, this year’s
Nobel Prize for Econom-
ics could go some way to
explaining why the Nobel
Prize committee are so
unwavering. The prize
was awarded to Richard
H. Thaler for incorpo-
rating psychologically
realistic assumptions into
analyses of economic de-
cision-making. By explor-
ing the consequences of
limited rationality, social
preferences, and lack of
self-control, he has shown
how these human traits
systematically affect indi-
vidual decisions as well as
market outcomes. Indeed
it would be interesting to
study how these affect the
Nobel Prize market.
It may not be entirely
fair to say the Nobel
Prize committees are
completely out of touch.
This year’s Peace Prize
was timely awarded to the
International Campaign to
Abolish Nuclear Weapons
(ICAN). But this raises
the question: if one prize
can be awarded to an
organisation, can the other
prizes be awarded to large
science collaborations?
If only Kazuo Ishiguro
had written more sci-fi,
we (the Science section)
could have had a clean
sweep!
Science and the world is changing quickly all around us: does the Nobel Prize need to catch up?

75% of global honey contaminated with pesticides

and increased pesticide
use.
Exposure may not
immediately kill a bee,
but the results of studies
showing sub-lethal effects
are concerning.
Impacts include effects
on immune efficiency,
foraging efficiency, re-
productive success, queen
survival, and changes in
behaviour. If the rate of
pollination or amount
of pollen collected is
lowered, the colony is at
higher risk of disease and
parasites, and may be less
likely to survive in the
long-term if colony repro-
duction is impaired.
Researchers tested 198
honey samples for the
five most common neon-
icotinoids. Samples were
collected from all conti-
nents, as well as various
isolated islands. 75%
had a minimum of one
neonicotinoid, 30% had
only one, 45% had two or
more and 10 % had four or
five. Concentrations were
highest in Europe, North
America, and Asia.
