‘Timeless’ recommendations for Autumn reading...
LetFelix Books’Andrada Balmeztakeyouthroughhertoppicksforautumnalreads,fromclassichorrortoscience-
fiction that eschews traditional genre tropes
AdulthoodisaMyth,bySarahAndersen
Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro
Salem’s Lot, by Stephen King
Illunimae, by Andy Kaufman and Jay Kristoff
I
know you are stuck in between two
assignments and three textbooks to read, so
you definitely don’t have a lot of time to lose
reading ‘for pleasure’, but I think that you can
find five minutes here and there to realise that
you are not the only one who has problems being
an adult.
Thisisanot-so-seriousbookaboutaveryserious
problem we all have to deal with now, narrated
in a very attractive way: graphic novel! Dealing
from problems ranging from “Getting dressed”to
“Dating”, there’s definitely a short comic that will
make you realise you are not alone into this! And
yes, you’ve probably seen one of these comics on
Tumblr at some point, but this book brings them
all together in a book you can rely on to lighten
up your‘Oh, no, I am failing my life!’days.
I
shiguro’s work is intense and intriguing –
I’d dare say impeccable in this story about
humanity who seems to be just a concept that
can only apply between ‘normals’ or between
‘donors’, but not between the two groups. This
book deals with so many hard questions that
it would be useless to start writing them down
here and, more importantly, it will make you find
different views no one has noticed before. No
wonder he won this year’s Literature Nobel!
The social alienation, the cultural norm, the
connection between sex and love and illness are
told in a conversational tone so that if you want,
you could just pretend you are having a chat with
your friend over a cup of tea. And, if you want,
you can pretend it’s just a work of science fiction
that doesn’t raise any questions. This book gives
you a lot of options and this is why it’s so damn
great! Stop reading this article and start reading
this book!
H
alloween is coming and this means…
perfect time for one of those horror
novels that everyone is praising! Yes,
you’ve guessed: the perfect time of the
year for some Stephen King! My recommendation
for a horror book is Salem’s Lot which, I know, is
not the most popular of his books, but it’s the only
one that gave me nightmares.
The classic vampire story manages to be scary
not due to an unexpected turn of events or
amazing actions you’ve never heard of before,
but due to the vivid descriptions. King is definitely
a master of description that can bring to life
anything, no matter how impossible it seems.

and Barlow. Or, if you think vampires are too last
season, you can try It as the movie just came out.
T
his was one of the best books I’ve read
this year and I plan on re-reading it before
the last book in the trilogy comes out –
so complex I have no idea where to start
from. This book seems so superficial at first sight
– you can read it as a nice science-fiction, but you
can, again, see so many faces of humanity in the
story that it will make you think twice. It might
lack some style for the fancier reader who doesn’t
want to be seen reading YA, but it compensates
in form – the story is told as a dossier that follows
Kady and Ezra and, my favourite character, the AI
system. If you don’t trust me when I say that this
is this decade’s space odyssey, just go to a library
and open the volume – you’ll be intrigued enough
to want to read it and then you’ll say I was right.
