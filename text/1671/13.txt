n Follies, the shine
has rubbed off from
the Weisman Theatre.
The musical sees a
group of retired chorus
girls who once performed
there gather to bid farewell
to their old haunt before it
is demolished. It is a love
letter to the New York
of old, the glamour of
Broadway and the pain of
reaching middle-age with
regrets. Older, wearier,
and dowdier the former
Weisman girls reminisce
on beauty lost, the paths
not taken, the lives not
lived. In particular the
story focuses on best
friends Phyllis and Sally
who have lost touch since
they left New York. Life
has taken them in different
directions – Sally is a
housewife still struggling
with self image, Phyllis,
more confident, more
successful, and outwardly
living the life they both
dreamed of is battling
demons of her own. Buddy
and Ben, their husbands,
are also ruminating on
the past and the choices
that have both led them
to troubled marriages.
During the night of their
reunion, buried flames
reignite, and old hurts
must be reckoned with.
Each character appears
on stage as a duplicate,
the ghosts of their former
selves mingle with
the returning dancers,
watching their future
unfold. Through the
younger incarnations of
the two couples we are
given flashbacks to their
youth. At the same time
the ghosts are conscious
of the future, watching
warily as their older, but
no wiser selves retrace
past mistakes. Here, Bill
Deamer’s fantastically
deft choreography really
comes into its own, the
sequences in which the
two versions of the char-
acters dance around each
other – sometimes mir-
roring, sometimes taking
one another’s place – are
stunningly good.
The original, first
staged in 1971, gave only
the central four characters
past and present versions,
but in the new staging
director Dominic Cooke
extends this to the entire
cast. This proves an
inspired choice, lending
buckets of pizzazz to the
big dance numbers – Dawn
Hope leads a wonderfully
energetic ‘Who’s That
Woman?’ in which the
older women recreate one
of their favourite numbers,
and as they dance, their
younger selves join in
until the stage lights up
in a wonderfully uplifting
galore of shimmies and
heel flicks. In the quieter
numbers, such as in Tracie
Bennett’s rendition of ‘I’m
Still Here’, in which she
recounts to the audience
the turbulent times she’s
survived, the presence of
her feather boa’d former
self watching from the
sidelines heightens the
poignancy. Bennett’s
song almost steals the
whole show – the moment
Terrific choreography is combined with strong performances in an inventive new restaging of the much beloved
musical starring Imelda Staunton.
Imelda Staunton as Sally in Follies // Johan Persson
when she stands from her
dressing table, belting
out the final painfully
defiant ‘I’m still here’ is
electrifying – rent, much
like the rest of the musical
with a undercurrent of
bittersweetness.
It is this recurring thread
of melancholy, beyond the
superficial glamour of the
bright lights and sequins
of the stage, that lingers
long after the curtain falls.
It has brilliantly tempering
effects on the saccharine
sweetness most of us
expect from musicals. It
is perhaps this grounding
in the shared human
experience of regret and
nostalgia that has made
Stephen Sondheim’s
music and lyrics from
Follies so enduring – as
beloved away from the
musical theatre stage as
they are on it.
James Goldman’s book
by contrast has not quite
stood up to the test of time
– here, the musical sags in
parts, feeling a bit dated,
certainly staleness is not
for a lack of acting chops

– the four leads, particu-
larly Imelda Staunton and
Janie Dee as Sally and
Phyllis are tremendous.
Staunton’s singing was a
personal revelation, her
portrayal of Sally deeply
affecting. Dee’s acerbic
wit is on sparkling form,
making ‘Can I Leave
You?’ one of the funniest,
most memorable numbers
of the musical.
There is much to
commend Cooke’s revival,
not least the wealth of
meaty characters it offers
older female actors, a de-
mographic criminally un-
derserved by the showbiz
world. It is easy to see
why Sondheim is a name
almost synonymous with
Broadway. Follies, one of
his earliest hits, is a true
musical theatre lover’s
musical, with just the
right mix of unadulterated
fun and pathos, with fan-
tastic music to boot. It is
unlikely to convert anyone
who is unsure of the form
but for the converted, it is
a triumph.
“Imelda
Staunton and
Janie Dee as
the central
characters
are both
tremendous ”
