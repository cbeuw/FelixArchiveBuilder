Acomplaintwasraised

S
everal committee
members of
Imperial College
Hockey Club
(ICHC) and ACC Men’s
Rugby were temporar-
ily banned last week,
following allegations of
misconduct at Freshers’
Trials.
The Freshers’ Trials,
which were attended by
a number of Imperial
sports clubs, took place
at Harlington Sports
Ground on Wednesday,
4th
October. A complaint
was raised against ICHC
after the trials, including
accusations that students
damaged the shower
heads in the changing
rooms, made a slip and
slide, covered the 3G
(AstroTurf) pitch in flour
and alcohol, and urinated
on the pitch and Queens
Park Rangers Football
Club (QPR FC) storage
facilities. In an email from
Imperial College Union,
ICHC were informed that
the “serious” complaint
alleged that “a high per-
centage of club members
were involved”, particu-
larly in “the urination on
another organisation’s
storage facilities”.
ACC Men’s Rugby also
had a complaint raised
against them, but Felix
cannot confirm whether
the accusations were the
same as those against
ICHC.
As a result of the
complaint, the Union sus-
pended a number of key
positions within ICHC, in-
cluding the Club Captain,
Treasurer, Secretary,
and all Male Captains,
including the Mixed Male
Captain. Members of
ACC Men’s Rugby were
also suspended. Those
suspended were unable to
carry out their Club roles,
attend events, or play for
the Club. An interim exec-
utive was appointed while
the committee members
were suspended.
In an email to their
mailing list, an ICHC
representative described
the situation as “difficult”,
asked members to be
“patient”, and emphasised
that “you are a repre-
sentative of ICHC and
therefore Imperial College
Union”, reminding them
to “conduct yourself in
an appropriate manner
at all trainings, matches,
and social events.” Some
members of ICHC posted
about the incident on social
media channels, using the
hashtag #pissgate.
The investigation
was led by a number of
Union staff, including
Tom Bacarese-Hamilton,
Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies), and its
findings passed on to
Imperial College Union’s
Governance Committee.
The investigation has
since concluded, and the
committee members have
been reappointed to their
positions.
In a statement, a rep-
resentative of Imperial
College Union told Felix:
“Last week we were made
aware of inappropriate
behaviour displayed by
some of our members
during Sports Trials on
Wednesday 4th
October.
We received a formal
complaint and suspend-
ed the student leaders
within the relevant clubs,
pending investigation.
The investigation has now
