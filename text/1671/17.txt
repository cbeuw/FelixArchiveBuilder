are direct descendants
of the Israelites in the
Bible. A few lines later,
Kendrick mentions his
cousin Carl Duckworth,
who is a member of the
Hebrew Israelites. At the
beginning and end of
‘FEAR.’, we hear voice-
mails from Carl where he
effectively explains that
Kendrick, and people of
colour in general, feel “He frequently
uses religious
imagery
to remind
listeners of the
consequences
of disobeying
God”
the concept of ‘wickedness
vs. weakness’. This con-
cept reflects the battle be-
tween faith and flesh and it
is immediately introduced
by the album’s opening
lines, “Is it wickedness?
/ Is it weakness? / You
decide / Are we gonna live
or die?”. Kendrick further
refers to this on ‘XXX.’
when a friend, whose
son was just murdered,
calls Kendrick saying,
“K-Dot, can you pray for
me? / It’s been a fucked
up day for me / I know
that you anointed, show
me how to overcome”.
Despite knowing better,
Kendrick’s gut reaction
is to seek revenge and he
replies, “I’ll chip a nigga,
then throw the blower in
his lap / Walk myself to
the court like, ‘Bitch, I did
that!’”. Kendrick ends the
verse with, “You should
chip a nigga, then throw
the blower in his lap /
Matter fact, I’m ‘bout to
speak at this convention /
Call you back”, followed
by a brief interlude: “Al-
right kids, we’re gonna
talk about gun control /
(Pray for me) Damn!”.
By contrasting the vi-
olent sentiment from this
verse with the non-violent
message from the ensuing
interlude, Kendrick gives
an insight to his internal
struggle with wickedness
and weakness. DAMN.
is a rebuke to the per-
ceived ‘saviour of rap’
position that he’s been
given since TPAB. The
weight of expectation has
become a burden and, by
juxtaposing tracks like
‘PRIDE.’ and ‘LUST.’
(two of the seven deadly
sins) with ‘HUMBLE.’
and ‘LOVE.’ respectively,
Kendrick is showing
us that, while trying to
remain humble, show love
and stay true to his faith,
he continues to struggle
with these sins of the flesh.
Kendrick’s music lends
itself to controversy and,

dropped on Good
Friday, the internet was
rife with rumours of a
second album dropping on
Easter Sunday, not least
due to troll tweets from
TDE producer Sounwave.
Although no second
album came, it has been
argued (and since con-
firmed by Kendrick) that,
with DAMN., Kendrick
actually released two
albums in one. When the
album is played from track
1 to 14, we hear the story
of the ‘weak’ Kendrick
Lamar and, when the
album is played in reverse,
it tells the story of the
‘wicked’ Kung-Fu Kenny.
This is hinted at through-
out DAMN. and it’s telling
that the album begins
with Kendrick’s death on
‘BLOOD.’. On the chorus
of ‘PRIDE.’, Kendrick
croons, “In another life, I
surely was there”, further
hinting at the duality
of character that he has
previously referred to in
his music. At the start of
‘DUCKWORTH.’, Kid
Capri literally tells us “We
gon’ put it in reverse” and
the track ends with us
delivered four completely
different listening experi-
ences. TPAB and GKMC
were met with widespread
critical acclaim due to
the visceral way in which
they evoked the modern
day black experience
and DAMN. is almost an
amalgamation of all his
previous offerings. While
TPAB was concerned with
the state of the times,
DAMN. is more concerned
with state of mind and self.
Kendrick is an album
artist in a singles era; a
unique artist who focuses
on delivering cohesive,
thoughtful, classic albums
in an era obsessed with
chasing easily-digestible
hit singles. He’s a self-
less rapper in a ‘selfie’
generation and continues
to tackle societal issues
and address the prob-
lems through his music.
Kendrick has proved
that he is undoubtedly the
greatest rapper alive. He is
a league above his current
competition and it’s now
time to debate Kendrick’s
standing amongst the
all-time hip-hop greats.
Time will tell where it
ultimately lands in the
ranking of Kendrick’s
overall discography, but
DAMN. feels like another
classic to instantly add
to the greatest rapper’s
impressive collection.
verse, Kendrick delves
into his “fear of losin’
creativity” and paranoia
around going broke de-
spite his monumental suc-
cess at age twenty-seven.
With storytelling
albums, the listener can
easily get drawn in and
there is a danger that
the concept behind the
album becomes stronger
than its individual tracks.
Kendrick avoids this
expertly on DAMN. and
takes fans on a journey
from start to finish.
Throughout DAMN.,
Kendrick repeatedly
refers to feeling afflicted,
beginning the first verse of
‘FEEL.’ with “I feel like
a chip on my shoulders”.
It has been theorised that
this chip on Kendrick’s
shoulder is in response
to those that continue to
doubt his standing as the
greatest rapper. Kendrick
doesn’t believe he’s
receiving the accolades
that his accomplishments
deserve and this could ex-
plain why Kung-Fu Kenny
came so hard on tracks like
‘DNA.’and ‘ELEMENT.’.
However, it’s more
likely that Kendrick is
expressing his frustration
at feeling abandoned by
those constantly looking
to him for wisdom, guid-
ance and prayer, whilst not
offering him the same. We
repeatedly hear Kendrick
bemoan this throughout
DAMN., alluding to it on
‘ELEMENT.’ (“Bitch, all
my grandmas dead / So
ain’t nobody prayin’ for
me, I’m on your head,
ayy”) and throughout
‘FEEL.’. He repeats,
“Ain’t nobody prayin’ for
me” on its hook, and the
final verse of ‘FEEL.’
ends with Kendrick
pleading, “I feel like the
whole world want me to
pray for ‘em / But who
the fuck prayin’ for me?”.
Kendrick has never shied
away from discussing reli-
gion in his music and this
album is no exception. On
‘YAH.’, Kendrick says,
“I’m a Israelite, don’t
call me black no mo’” – a
reference to the Hebrew
Israelite movement, a
branch of Christianity
which consists of people
of colour who believe they

sound”
afflicted because they are
being punished by God.
While some artists
focus on God’s blessings,
Kendrick prefers to focus
on the fire-and-brimstone,
jealous God of discipline
from the Old Testament.
Kendrick has since said
that he feels it’s his calling
not only to share the joy of
God but, more so, the fear
of God and, in his artistry,
hefrequentlyusesreligious
imagery to remind listen-
ers of the consequences
of disobeying God.
This ties in nicely with
another of the album’s
central recurring themes,
hearing the whole album
played in reverse before
Kendrick’s first line from
‘BLOOD.’ (“So I was
taking a walk the other
day”) is repeated, bringing
the album full circle.
DAMN. has no skippa-
ble tracks, which is just
testament to the strength
of the album. Kendrick’s
artistic innovation is
matched by few and
he always manages to
surprise us. In his four
studio albums, Section.80,
GKMC, TPAB and, now,
DAMN., Kendrick has
