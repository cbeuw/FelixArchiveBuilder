Marvel Universe’s small screen efforts make for
forgettable television
Netflix’s latest foray into Marvel’s Cinematic Universe finally brings its small screen ensemble together. But is
Defenders an Avengers-style blockbuster or a Fantastic Four flop?

A
fter two years
and five seasons
worth of epi-
sodes between
the characters, Marvel’s
darker and grittier street
level heroes finally come
together Avengers-style.
However, after all the
build-up and a lacklustre
performance from Iron
Fist, the biggest question
was whether Defenders
would be able to justify all
the hype. Unfortunately,
the answer is no; sure
it’s better than Iron Fist,
but it’s disjointed, poorly
paced, and ultimately
misses an opportunity to
be something greater.
The first two episodes
don’t do the show any
favours, as hardly anything
happens. All we see are
the individual characters
going off on their own
pursuits, which are pretty
vaguely connected at best.
I’m all for building things
up , but with only eight
episodes, it’s frustrating
that nothing majorly
relevant or interesting
happens until the heroes
finally meet at the end of
episode two. It doesn’t
help that everyone’s in-
dividual stories aren’t as
interesting or engaging as
they were in each of their
individual shows.
The show really kicks
into gear when all the
heroes get together and
clash against each other’s
conflicting personalities,
which is the real meat
of any crossover and
team-up. The chemistry
between all the charac-
ters is fantastic, and it’s
“The chemistry
between all the
characters is
fantastic, and
it’s fun seeing
them get to
know each
other”
“With all the
engaging
moments there
is an equal
number of
outright dumb
ones”
fun seeing them get to
know each other as well
as question each other’s
styles and methods. One
of my favourite moments
is when everyone’s having
dinner and discussing
each other’s situations and
information. Sometimes
you don’t need a big battle
with epic proportions to
get involved and immersed
in a story. Frustratingly,
there aren’t as many
interactions as we’d like.
Danny and Luke work
particularly well against
each other and Jessica’s
snarky personality clashes
brilliantly with Daredevil.
Once they all meet, the
quality of the show goes
up a few notches. We see
all the Defenders forced
together as a result of the
Hand, a criminal organi-
sation already established
in Daredevil and Iron Fist.
With the danger to their
loved ones, they’re forced
to work together and plan
ahead against their own
wishes. Unfortunately, the
final act is less interesting,
thanks in no small part to
the villains.
The Hand remain the
weakest villains of all the
Netflix series so far. They
have very little personality
and, in particular, Sigour-
ney Weaver’s Alexandra
is a very bland character,
especially when compared
to the likes of the other
Netflix villains. The inten-
tions of the group are also
kept very vague until the
end where their plan turns
out to be something a bit
bizarre and fanatical. The
Fingers of the Hand that
are introduced later on are
somewhatmoreinteresting
but any potential nuance
and insight they could’ve
had is foregone in favour
of plot progression. At the
end of the day, the Hand
just weren’t worth all the
build up we were getting
from the previous shows.
It’s really aggravating,
especially when there are
hints of better storylines
and ideas. The return of
Elodie Yung as Elektra
is very well-done. She’s
a more credible villain
to the Defenders and her
connection to Daredevil
already makes her more
compelling than Alexan-
dra. It’s this relationship
with Daredevil that sows
the seeds of disharmony
amongst the team as
they’re struggling to unite
in precarious circumstanc-
es. Her story eventually
gets merged with the less
interesting one of the
Hand which leads to an
uninspiring and lacklustre
final two episodes.
The action sequences
are entertaining, though
not as amazing as they
could’ve been. Highlights
include a hallway fight
where the characters come
together for the first time
and a Daredevil vs. Iron
Fist fight in the middle of
the series. The scenes with
the Fingers however, don’t
justify their supposed
fighting prowess. Ad-
ditionally, most of the
action sequences don’t
really have much weight
to them; for the most part,
it’s the Defenders fighting
ninjas in isolated loca-
tions. Without civilians
in the potential crossfire,
there’s no great sense of
desperation or tension
which could’ve added so
much more.
With all the fun and
engaging moments, there
is an equal number of
troublesome and outright
dumb moments. Danny
is told the Hand need his
power and he proceeds
to use it in a very crucial
moment (his character is
better here than in his own
show at least). Also Dare-
devil, whose entire shtick
is heightened senses, can’t
hear someone making
very little effort to sneak
up on him. Similarly,
the supporting cast from
the individual shows
don’t have much of a
strong presence outside
of Foggy’s occasional
appearances, and the few
interactions they have
seem forced.
While the show has
moments of excitement
and fun, ultimately they’re
only due to the brief
character interactions
and less from a compel-
ling plot and engaging
villains. While there was
potential for the show to
be something great, at the
end of the day it just felt
hastily put together and
average for the most part.
Hopefully, any future
endeavours with the team
are more successful, more
cohesive, and can deliver a
more interesting story.
