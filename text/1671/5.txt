Catalonia faces a uncertain future after an
independence vote riddled with irregularities

o you want
Cataluña to be
an independ-
ent state in the
form of a republic? This
was the question posed
to the 5,313,564 inhab-
itants of Cataluña, of
which an overwhelming
90% voted “yes”, with a
turnout of 42.3%.
While it is true that the
right to self-determination
is a fundamental human
right, and that the people
should dictate the govern-
ment and not vice versa, it
is of no surprise that this
referendum was deemed
illegal by the Spanish
constitutional court (a
ruling corroborated by the
European Commission).
Not because of the ques-
tion that is being asked,
but because of the way
that this question is being
asked to the Catalonian
people.
A review by interna-
tional observers conclud-
ed the referendum did not

Prime Minister Mariano
Rajoy has encouraged
Puigdemont to clarify his
statement. If Puigdemont
refuses to back down,
Rajoy can retaliate by
activating Article 155
of the constitution. This
essentially allows the
central government to take
complete control over its
autonomous communities
(i.e. Cataluña) and allows
it to take “necessary meas-
ures” to force the region
to comply with laws and
obligations imposed by
central government.
Yet again, the Spanish
central government has

standards owing to numer-
ous irregularities. These
included people being
allowed to vote multiple
times and use homemade
‘voting slips’. Some ballot
boxes were placed in the
street, allowing citizens
to vote without being
regulated, and transported
without having been
sealed. There were also
suggestions some ballot
boxes may have contained
votes before arriving at
polling stations.
Even if the referendum
had been carried out to
international standards,
it would have still been
illegal under Spanish
constitutional law, and it is
here that the real problem
resides. There is no legal
way for Catalonian people
to decide if they wish to
be Spanish or not. The
government offered no
legal dialogue or alterna-
tive to the people of Cat-
alonia to ask them about
their national identity.
Instead, they sent the
police and civil guards to
ensure this referendum did
not happen, even if that
included the use of force.

are repeatedly silenced.
The aftermath was no
less problematic than the
referendum itself. Shortly
after the referendum, the
president of Cataluña,
Carles Puigdemont, gave
an ambiguous statement

“I assume the mandate that
Catalonia should become
an independent state in the
form of a republic.” But
this was swiftly followed
by: “I propose suspending
between itself and the
Catalonian government
by resorting to the use
of force. This is still no
justification for the poorly
monitored referendum and
the uncertain declarations
of Puigdemont, but there
seems to be little chance
of understanding and
dialogue if both parties
continue to engage with
each other in this manner.
