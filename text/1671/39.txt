I
mperial College
Union (ICU)
Badminton had an
amazing turnout at
Fresher’s Fair this year,
with over 500 individuals
expressing interest in the
society. You may have
seen our giant badminton
racket and banner out on
the Queen’s Lawn – thank
you to our new partners
YONEX UK for these!
We will be working
with them, alongside Sin-
gaporean food & beverage
company Yeo’s and other
yet to be confirmed parties,
in hosting the Imperial
College Badminton
Tournament along with
ICSM Badminton and
Queen Mary University
on November 4th
at Kens-
ington Leisure Centre.
Sign up or come along to
support your friends for a
fun day of badminton and
socializing!
In addition to the
tournament and other
special events throughout
the year, our partnership
with YONEX will give
the YONEX All-England
Open in Birmingham.
Following the start of
term, we’ve held multiple
taster sessions at Ethos,
welcoming individuals
with a wide range of
playing experience and
giving those who have
never played before an
opportunity to just come
along and have a few hits.
We’ve been blown away
by the enthusiasm, having
had 60 students show up
on the Sunday before term
started, and are excited
to see what this year will
bring for the society.
The new committee
BUCS and LUSL leagues.
The men’s 1st team will
be looking to improve
even further upon their
impressive third place
finish in last year’s BUCS
Premier League, and the
2nd team will be pushing
for promotion into the
First Division, while the
women’s team will want
to reclaim their place in
the Premier League.
From the talent on
show at this year’s trials,
captains Shivam Bhat-
nagar, Noah Semonin,
Gemma McGuire and
Joseph Kim are confident
of a successful season
ahead.
Continuing from last
year’s great work, ICU
Badminton will be fur-
thering our social team
project for any members
in the club looking for a
competitive playing expe-
rience in addition to our
club sessions.
Starting this term,
social training sessions
will be available on Friday
evenings for interested
members. These will be
led at Ethos by some of our
team members, namely
Edward Liu.
Our social captains
Eugenius Ng and Carolina
Azeredo welcome indi-
viduals from a wide skill
bracket, offering the op-
portunity to attend a com-
petition to all members of
the society to if they wish
to do so!
