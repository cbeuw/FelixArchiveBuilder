Petition asks for Wetherspoons to take over Union bars
and attacks cost-saving claims as “complete bollocks”
A
p e t i t i o n
d e m a n d i n g
that the Union
“replace Bug
Light with an actual
beer” has attracted 276
signatures at the time of
going to press. Started
last Friday, the petition
claims rising prices are
“ruining the experiences
of virtually all Imperial
students”.
The Union said that
the move from Stella
Artois to Bud Light would
save students more than
£10,000 as remaining with
Stella would have required
a 10p price increase to
£2.80. The move is also
supposed to ensure drink
prices do not exceed in-
flation (currently at 2.9%).
The petition attacks this
as “complete bollocks”,
saying that the price has
risen 12.5% in terms of
alcohol content. In order to
maintain a real-terms price
freeze, the petition argues
that Bud Light should be
priced at £2.36 per pint.
It goes on to assert
that the Union could sell
cheaper and better beer
while still making a profit.
A pint of Bud Light in the
Union bars costs £2.70.
The same in Wetherspoons
is £2.30. The petition sug-
gests that Wetherspoons
be given a contract to run
the Union bars as “clearly
[Wetherspoons] could do
a better job of not ripping
off the Union’s beloved
members.”
The petition has been
signed by 1.5% of ICU
members. Supporters have
commented “no human
should have to drink Bud
Light”. Descriptions of
the beer include “trash”,
“shit”, and “fake beer”.
Deputy President
(Finance & Services)
Matt Blackett declined to
comment.

under investigation the
following day.
Eleven people were
injured when a black
Toyota Prius minicab
mounted the pavement
outside the Natural
History Museum and hit
two other cars. Emergency
services set up a cordon
and evacuated the area,
with bystanders fleeing
the scene or being ushered
into the Science Museum.
It was quickly established
that the incident was not
terrorism-related.
First-year mechanical
engineering student Kyr-
iacos Theocharides was
nearby when the incident
occurred.
“I heard a loud bang fol-
lowed by some crunching
sounds, like metal hitting
metal. My initial reaction
was there must have been
some collision. Fearing a
terrorist attack, I wanted
to make sure I got out of
the area as fast as possible.
I started sprinting to the
station in a panic, like
everyone else,” he said.
He added: “I calmed
down a bit when I realised
the danger was most likely
over and nothing had
happened since the crash.
I started to worry when
news outlets reported a
big incident. I didn’t know
how bad the situation was
or if anyone was seriously
hurt.”
Nine people, including
the driver, were taken to
hospital. Most suffered
minor head or leg injuries
and have now been dis-
charged from the hospital.
An Imperial student was
injured as people fled to
South Kensington tube
station and rushed down
the escalators. Exhibition
Road was reopened the
day after the accident
although a cordon is still
in place around a street
sign with which the car
collided.
Director of the Victoria
& Albert museum Tris-
tram Hunt has suggested
banning traffic from
Exhibition Road. Speak-
ing at the Cheltenham
Literature Festival, he
said: “We would want
Exhibition Road to be
pedestrianised though of
course we will have to talk
to the locals about how we
would accomplish that.”
