The Death of Stalin: Armando Iannucci returns
FILM

S
cotsman Armando
Iannucci is the
finest political
satirist of the 21st
century. Through his tel-
evision shows The Thick
of It and it’s American
adaptation Veep, he has
shown a propensity for
mocking politicians who
ostensibly claim to have
the interests of the people
at heart, while actually
only being concerned
about their own agenda
of obtaining as much
power and influence as is
humanly possible. He also
directed one of the wittiest
comedies of the new mil-
lennium, with 2009’s In
the Loop concerning the
West’s decision to go to
war in Iraq.
For his sophomore
effort, and his first film
in eight years, he turns
his attention to one of
the darkest periods in
European history - the
Stalin-era Soviet Union. It
is a shame that we had to
wait so long for Iannucci
to follow up In the Loop,
but this also serves to
make his evolution as
a director all the more
evident. The camera work
is more refined, as are the
other technical elements,
with costume design, hair
and make-up, score and
editing all absolutely on
point here.
The stakes are much
higher than anything he
has done before, and that
is not just because of the
increased budget, high
profile cast and the weight
of expectation based on his
own reputation growing.
Where a faux-pas from
vice-president Selina
Meyer of Veep may result
in a couple of days of bad
press, even the tiniest slip
in Stalin’s Russia likely
will cost one’s life. This is
established early on when
a manic Paddy Considine
scrambles to get his or-
chestra to redo a concert,
with all spectators still
present, as Stalin has re-
quested a recording. “No
one is going to be killed”,
he says unconvincingly.
We meet Stalin’s
cabinet, a group of ageing
men forced by their eternal
leader to engage in boozy
dinners and watch John
Wayne films, desperately
stumbling over each other
to win his favour. There
is a hilarious tension at
all times as each man so
badly wants to make their
leader laugh, but is equally
worried about angering
him. Eventually the event
after which the film takes
its name does occur, the
result of a stroke. Stalin’s
cronies gather around their
boss’ body, which gives
rise to a running joke
about a puddle of urine,
evidencing Iannucci’s
uncanny ability to mix
high and low humour to
a devastating effect. So
ensues a scramble for
power.
The leadership falls
to the hapless Georgy
Malenkov (an excellent
Jeffrey Tambor). He is ex-
tremely unsure of himself,
and finding a young girl to
take an iconic photograph
with is seemingly far
higher up his to-do-list
than running the country.
The toad-like chief of
police Lavrentiy Beria (a
devious Simon Russell
Beale), positions himself
well, essentially calling
the shots while Malenkov
is occupied with getting a
new haircut. One suspects
he has been planning his
own ascent to the throne
well before Stalin actually
croaked. In opposition to
Beria is Nikita Khrush-
chev (Steve Buscemi
sporting a prosthetic
nose). A twisting plot
involving back-stabbing
and paper-thin alliances
follows. Anyone familiar
with Russian history will
know what happens, such
is the accuracy with which
Iannucci draws from his
source material, a French
graphic novel by Fabien
Nury and Thierry Robin.
This is a true ensemble
piece, with a number of big
names who will hopefully
help draw crowds into
theatres to see The Death
of Stalin. The film’s title
does not initially scream
comedy, and so this may
be difficult to sell to those
not already familiar with
Iannucci’s work. Stalin
is surely one of the best
cast films of the year,
with Tambor, Buscemi,
Beale, Considine, Jason
Isaacs, Michael Palin (his
first proper film role this
decade), Andrea Risebor-
ough and Rupert Friend
all excelling. They use
their natural American and
British accents – Isaacs, as
Red Army chief Georgy
Zhukov, delivers his lines
with a particularly ag-
gressive Yorkshire drawl.
This helps tie what is on
screen to the modern day,
as well as establish the
film as comedic right from
the off. Also, Russians do
not speak English with
a Russian accent in their
everyday lives, so why go
for a half measure?
Expectations ahead of
Stalin opening the Toronto
International Film Festival
were sky high. Iannucci, a
man who has mastered tel-
evision on both sides of the
pond and scored success
with his debut film, takes
to the biggest stage of his
career and performs yet
again. He does not shy
away from the horrors
of the Soviet Union’s
past, and his unflinching,
pitch-black comedy is
exactly what we need in
a time that will almost
certainly be satirised by
the Armando Iannucci of
the 22nd century.
The Death of Stalin is
released in UK cinemas
on the 20th October.
Renowned political satirist Armando Iannucci’s second escapade into film. It may be The Death of Stalin but will it
be the revival of top notch satire movie making?
