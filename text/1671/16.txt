positive lyrics from ‘Al-
right’ to boost their ratings
and push their agenda.
The album’s promotion
had fans expecting a more
aggressive Kendrick
and Kung-Fu Kenny
delivers on this promise
with ‘ELEMENT.’. As
with ‘The Heart Part 4’
and ‘HUMBLE.’, K-Dot
comes with a militant vibe,
going at all other rappers
on the chorus of ‘ELE-
MENT.’: “If I gotta slap
a pussy ass nigga, Imma
make it look sexy”. With
the line, “Mr. one through
five, that’s the only logic”,
Kendrick again asserts
his dominance over the
rap game by effectively
saying “fuck your top five
MCs list, I am the list”.
He further disregards
his competition when he
says “I am legend, I feel
like all of y’all is peasants”
on the poignant ‘FEEL.’.
Kendrick’s final verse on
‘ELEMENT.’ ends with,
“Last LP I tried to lift the
black artists / But it’s a dif-
ference between black art-
ists and wack artists” and,
with these bars, one thing
is clear: gone is the Kum-
baya Kendrick from TPAB
with the uplifting message
of black empowerment.
Instead, Kung-Fu Kenny
is coming at wack artists’
necks and nobody is safe.
It could be argued that
Kendrick’s conscious
music requires too much
thought, and hence isn’t
an easy listen for casual
fans. This could explain
his lack of chart-topping
hits (prior to DAMN.,
Kendrick’s highest chart
success was ‘Swimming
Pools’ from GKMC,
which landed at number
17). However, Kendrick
has noticeably reinvented
his sound and moved
away from the jazz/funk
influences of his previous
storytelling, conceptual
albums. DAMN. has an
overall more marketable,
commercial sound and in-
cludes radio-friendly hits
like the Rihanna collabo-
ration, ‘LOYALTY.’, the
smooth ballad, ‘LOVE.’,
and ‘HUMBLE.’,
which became his first
number one as lead artist.
DAMN. is 2017’s
highest selling album and
its commercial success
is proof of Kendrick’s
ability to produce stand-
alone hits as well as
classic albums without
abandoning his integrity
by relying on shallow, ma-
terialistic subject matter.
Deep Dive into DAMN.
With the DAMN. tour on its way to London, revisit the album itself with Felix’s resident Kendrick stan

S
ince dropping
b a c k - t o - b a c k
classics with
2012’s good kid,
m.A.A.d city (GKMC) and
2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly
(TPAB), Kendrick Lamar
has been relatively quiet
– I would go as far as to
say that we’ve had to put
up with polished medioc-
rity in his absence. He did
surprise fans with Untitled
Unmastered last year,
but this felt more like an
extension of TPAB. Fans
were on red alert when, a
day after teasing its release
with a cryptic Instagram
post, he released ‘The
Heart Part 4’. “The five-
foot giant woke up out of
his sleep” to declare he’s
reached “the legendary
status of a hip-hop rhyme
saviour”, denounce
Donald Trump, and
challenge his contempo-
raries (“Yellin’ ‘One, two,
three, four, five / I am the
greatest rapper alive!’”).
He even sent subliminal
shots: “My fans can’t wait
for me to son ya punk ass
and crush ya whole lil’
shit / I’ll Big Pun ya punk
ass, you a scared lil’ bitch
/ Tip-toein’ around my
name nigga, you lame /
And when I get at you
homie, don’t you tell me
you was just playin”. Ken-
drick and Drake have had
a subliminal beef since
Kendrick took shots in his
infamous ‘Control’ verse
in 2013 and it’s telling that
Kendrick effectively stole
Drake’s thunder by drop-
ping this on March 23rd
,
just five days after Drake
released More Life.
Having said that, it’s
more likely that Kendrick
was addressing Big Sean,
who sneak-dissed the
“saviour of rap” on his
track, ‘No More Inter-
views’. No offence to Big
Sean but there is simply
no comparing him to Ken-
drick; it’s like comparing a
candle to the Sun.
Kendrick ended ‘The
Heart Part 4’ by throwing
down the gauntlet, warn-
ing the entire rap scene,
DAMN., his 4th
album,
with ‘BLOOD.’ and
we hear a story of him
attempting to help a blind
woman, only for her to
turn around and shoot
him. The track ends with a
brief sample of Fox News
reporters criticising his
2015 BET awards perfor-
mance of ‘Alright’, from
TPAB. We then launch
straight into the explosive
second track, ‘DNA.’,
and Kendrick relentlessly
bombards us with bar
after bar of pure heat.
‘DNA.’ is undeniably
an album standout, and
I’m not ashamed to admit
that it gassed me so
much on first listen that
I was punching the air
for no damn reason. The
final verse is particularly
breathtaking, with Ken-
drick using double-time
flow to seemingly fit
more rhymes in each
bar than sounds possible
without coming up for air,
breathlessly showcasing
his pure lyrical ability.
Ahead of the final verse,
we hear a brief sample
of Fox reporter Geraldo
Rivera’s ludicrous claim
that “hip-hop has done
more damage to young
African-Americans than
racism in recent years”
in response to Kendrick’s
2015 BET awards perfor-
mance. Kendrick directly
responds to this criticism
on the next track, ‘YAH.’
when he says, “Interviews
wanna know my thoughts
and opinions / Fox News
wanna use my name for
percentage” and “Some-
body tell Geraldo this
nigga got some ambition”.
Through repeatedly refer-
encing their criticism of
him and hip-hop in gener-
al on the first three tracks,
Kendrick is telling Fox
News (and mainstream
media in general) that he
sees through their delib-
erate manipulation of his
name and image, and their
misinterpretation of the

A week later, Kendrick
released outstanding vis-
uals for the album’s lead
single, ‘HUMBLE’. With
its catchy hook, Kendrick
effectively tells Big Sean
and the rest of his competi-
tion to humble themselves,
all while using Sean’s “lil’
bitch” ad-lib.
Kendrick begins
Although Kendrick
has taken a new direction
with DAMN., that’s not
to say that storytelling
has been completely
abandoned on this album.
In fact, almost every track
tells its own story. His
storytelling prowess par-
ticularly comes to the fore
on ‘FEAR.’ and the last
track, ‘DUCKWORTH.’,
on which we hear Ken-
drick effortlessly float
over three distinct beats
whilst recounting a tale
about the shocking coin-
cidental link between his
father and Top Dawg, the
head of Kendrick’s label.
Kendrick is at his most
reflective on ‘FEAR.’,
as he explores experi-
encing fear at different
stages in his life. Each
verse is delivered from
a different perspective,
with Kendrick assuming
the character of his strict
mother on the first verse,
instilling fear of author-
ity into a seven-year-old
Kendrick. Having grown
up surrounded by gang
violence and police brutal-
ity, Kendrick dedicates the
second verse to his fear
of an untimely death at
age seventeen. In the final
