Memes, marketing, and Szechuan sauce
An attempt by McDonald’s to tap into the Rick and Morty fandom by giving away a sauce from the 1990s shows
us a bit about fandoms, but a lot about how marketing works in the digital age.

A
grown man,
wearing a
snapback and a
Rick and Morty
t-shirt, leaps up on the
counter of an American
McDonald’s, and de-
mands his dipping sauce.
Shouting catchphrases
from the TV show, the
video ends with the man
writhing on the floor,
shouting “I’m pick-
le-Rick”, while underpaid
employees look on with
detached bemusement.
The accompanying tweet,
from @jackdwagner: “we
really gotta raise the mini-
mum wage”.
This video, and many
others like it, exploded
acrossTwitter last week, as
McDonald’s attempted to
drum up hype by bringing
back its Szechuan sauce,
released in 1997 as a tie-in
promotion for the Disney
film Mulan. The problem:
few stores had the sauce
in adequate numbers, if
at all, and the result was
hundreds of Rick and
Morty fans left disap-
pointed. In some stores,
police had to be called,
as people were unable to
contain their anger at the
employees being unable
to supply them with a TV
tie-in joke.
A bit of background
is needed: this particular
Szechuan sauce has been
referred to multiple times
throughout the third
season of Rick and Morty,
serving as a kind of plot
driver for the exploits of
the misanthropic, genius
inventor Rick, and his
beleaguered grandson
Morty. Justin Roiland,
one of the co-creators of
the show, received a jar
of the sauce earlier in the
The fans of Rick and
Morty have become a
cultural entity all of their
own. Their behaviour
has spawned a series of
internet memes – particu-
larly centring around the
idea that some fans had
about how intelligent you
needed to be to understand
a show in which one epi-
sode’splotrevolvesaround
Rick turning himself into
a pickle. It’s a perfect
example of what Pulitzer
Prize-winning critic Emily
Nussbaum calls ‘the Bad
Fan’ – proponents of a
show who will stop at
nothing to defend it. In a
recent article, the AV Club
writer Clayton Purdom
complained that the
show’s fans are “getting
really fucking hard to deal
with.”
While #saucegate might
capture a particularly
embarrassing aspect of
fan culture – perhaps a
by-product of countless
TV shows that tell the
audience that to be smart
you have to be cruel – the
way McDonald’s attempt-
ed to exploit the hype
actually shows something
more interesting: the
worrying trend of hy-
per-capitalist institutions
making use of internet
culture as a marketing
tool.
From Doritos using
memes to advertise on
Twitter, to pop stars at-
tempting to generate viral
videos in exchange for
album listens, no aspect
of the web is safe from
monetisation. Indeed, it
could be argued that this
is the basic purpose of the
internet. As Jaret Kopek,
author of the Silicon
Valley-satire I Hate the
Internet writes:
“[The Internet] was
designed with the sold
purpose of maximizing
the amount of bullshit that
people typed into their
computers and telephones.
The greater the intercon-
nectivity, the greater the
profits. It was feudalism
in the service of brands,
and it rested on inducing
Well actually, Morty, you need to be very clever to understand this show // Adult Swim
human beings to indulge
in their worst behaviour”.
The fashion house
Gucci attempted to do this
earlier this year, as part
of their promotion for a
watch collection. They
enlisted artists and “meme
creators”, to generate a
series of advertisements
they hoped would spark
the internet alight. In
one ‘meme’, the caption
“When you get a new
watch but you don’t have
any friends to show it to”
sits above a pre-Raphael-
ite painting, upon which
Gucci ‘swag’ has been
superimposed, in a clear
reference to the ‘classical
art memes’ that dominated
the internet a few years
ago. The campaign was a
failure.
It makes sense for these
companies to jump on
the meme bandwagon.
The internet thrives on
such user-generated
content, which has little
to no intellectual property
regulation. After all, cop-
yrighting a meme would
remove its lifeblood:
the ability to share and
alter it. For corporations,
meme culture represents
the intersection of two
market goals: an engaged
consumer base, and free
content-production. But
for those interested in
memes, such attempts at
monetisation will always
fail, since they tend to kill
of the very meme they are
exploiting. Once Burger
King starts tweeting, the
meme is dead.
While the Szechuan
sauce promotion, and its
resulting fiasco, might
reveal something about
the nature of some
die-hard Rick and Morty
fans, who were willing to
travel hundreds of miles
to partake in an internet
in-joke and scream at
minimum-waged staff,
it actually tells us more
about how marketing can
work in the digital age. It
is unlikely that this trend
will change anytime soon.
Until then, hide yo’ kids,
hide yo’ memes.
