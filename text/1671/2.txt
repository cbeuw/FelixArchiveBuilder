What is Felix for?
THIS WEEK’S LONG-READ:
Sabb-otage: What the sabbatical team have planned

W
ith this year
being my
sixth at
I m p e r i a l ,
if there’s one thing I’ve
learnt it’s that some things
never change. Curly fries
will take centre-stage
in student life, the Felix
Editor will rarely leave
the basement, and sports
teams will get in trouble
at some point during the
course of the year.
I attended my first Com-
munications Committee
meeting in the Union
this week. I learnt a lot,
like what happens in the
Union’s inner sanctum,
and what biscuits are on
offer there. One question
that was discussed a bit
was ‘what is Felix for?’
and I don’t think I have
a clear answer. Please
send in your thoughts on
a postcard to the Felix
office!
In many ways, the
role of Felix is to keep
students up to date about
what’s going on, which
then allows them to hold
the College and Union to
account. You can’t effect
change if you don’t know
what’s happening, and
– all due respect to both
the Union and College
– the way decisions are
communicated to students
and staff can be a little
‘heavy’. Part of what Felix
does is to cut through all
that, to try and ensure that
nothing is done about you,
without you.
As such, being in the
Felix team means listening
to as many different people
on campus as possible.
Every story that we print
in Felix has two sides, and
it’s our job to make sure
that both those sides are
heard, so don’t be afraid
to get in touch – unlike the
other sabbatical officers, I
never turn on out-of-office
replies, mostly because I
can’t work out how to do
it.
But another important
aspect of Felix is creating
a community of student
writers, editors, illustra-
tors, and photographers.
It’s sounds a bit glib, but
I really do believe that
there are so many talented
people at Imperial who
don’t get the exposure
that they deserve. During
my time on the editorial
team, I’ve gone through
some incredible content
from student writers,
watched new editors go
from strength to strength,
and shuttled between the
edit studio and the office
with cups of tea for our
Head Photographer as he
does a sky replacement on
Photoshop.
Being at an all-STEM
(well, and business) uni-
versity means that things
are a bit different. There
aren’t as many people who
come to uni with plans
ready-made in their head
of becoming journalists
and writers. You might
think that this is a problem
for a student paper, but
actually it can be the
opposite: the atmosphere
is a bit more relaxed, it’s
easier for people to get
involved, and students
do it out of the goodness
of their heart, rather than
chasing bylines. It melts
my cold, icy heart.
Finally, I’d like to think
that Felix is something that
students genuinely enjoy
picking up and reading
every week. When I do my
rounds of the campus on a
Friday, dropping stacks off
in departments I’ve never
been in before, I love
seeing people grab issues
hot off the press, eager for
#content. Even if people
only turn to the centrefold
and Puzzles (shoutout
to Joe for his Photoshop
magic this week, and
Hamish for doubling up
on the Puzzles spread), at
least they’re reading. And
my job is done.
Oh, and this editorial
also gives me a chance
to spill my guts each
week. Better than a diary
I guess...
