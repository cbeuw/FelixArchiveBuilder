“The gentle,
undulating
flow of his
words always
carried with
it a certain
melancholy”
I
first encountered
Kazuo Ishiguro’s
writing back in high
school, in the form of
his short story collection
Nocturnes. I had won
some book vouchers, and
was browsing the local
bookstore for something
worth buying when I came
across this slim volume.
Five Stories of Music and
Nightfall, it read, against
an austere background of
blurred fairy lights in the
twilight. Curiosity piqued,
I bought it despite having
never heard of Ishiguro
before that, and thus
began my love affair with
Ishiguro’s words.
It was his words that
drew me in. The gentle,
undulating flow of his
words always carried with
it a certain melancholy, as
if embodying the multiple
depths of emotion of his
characters. The quiet
calmness of his tone does
not attempt to articulate
every level of his char-
acters’ complex internal
world – on the contrary,
it respects this complexity
by acknowledging the
inability of words to ever
fully capture emotional
depth, and thus in the
process defers to its power.
Indeed, the Swedish
Academy conferred the
Nobel Prize in Literature
upon him for novels which
“uncovered the abyss
beneath our illusory sense
of connection with the
world” and were driven
by a “great emotional
force”. It was this ‘abyss’
that I had been getting
glimpses of across his
books that I’ve read, and
this ‘emotional force’ that
had moved me.
After Nocturnes, I
moved on to his arguably
most famous book, The
Remains of the Day, since
it had won the Booker
prize. I read it at a point in
my life when I was starting
to make larger, more
consequential decisions,
and Steven’s struggles
really stood out for me,
not as an explicit lesson
but by being a bystander
watching his internal
drama as it unfolded
before me.
Ishiguro’s novels are
never the least didactic,
unlike, say, those of
Margaret Atwood (one of
the favourite speculations
for this year’s prize whom
I’m glad did not win, but
that’s a story for another
day). We watch as Stevens
struggles to tell his story,
revealing information
then correcting himself,
wrestling with himself
in coming to terms with
his past decisions, as if
earnestly hoping for the
reader’s assurance that his
life had been lived well.
We become anxious for
him, then for ourselves.
Ishiguro’s novels
examine life incisively,
as if we are suddenly
presented the world
through hyper-sharp
glasses that illuminate our

own internal worlds more
clearly. Themes of loss,
regret, ephemerality and
the fragility of memory
permeate his work, and
the universality of these
themes are demonstrated
by the various different
settings of his novels.
Despite moving to
England at the age of five,
the hometown that he
never knew impacted him
enough that his first two
novels, An Artist of the
Floating World and A Pale
View of Hills, were set in
Japan.
An Artist of the Floating
World appeared to be the
precursor, a working draft
of sorts, for The Remains
of the Day. I read it after
Remains, but detected a
similar plotline: a narrator
looking back on his past,
wrestling with past de-
cisions, unreliable in his
storytelling because of
parts of his life he wants
to forget, decisions that
he regrets. However, their
very different settings
gave each an entirely
“Ishiguro’s
novels
examine life
incisively,
as if we are
suddenly
presented the
world through
hyper-sharp
glasses”
