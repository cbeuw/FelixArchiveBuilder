Literature, is master of words and the heart
“Themes of
loss, regret,
ephemereality
and the
fragility of
memory
permeate his
work”
“Ishiguro
is...unique
because most
past winners
tend to be
either less well-
known by the
general public,
or their wins
are political”
Kazuo Ishiguro, winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature // David Levene
different feel, yet drawing
parallels in themes across
space and time.
When The Buried
Giant came out in 2015, it
caused a stir as it seemed
to be of a style and genre
‘unusual’ for Ishiguro.
Without a named setting,
the novel is set vaguely
in Arthurian England, and
features ogres, dragons
and knights. New Yorker
critic James Wood de-
scribed it as “an allegory
at once too vague and
too literal”, and I know
what he means. I found
it difficult to get through,
because it moved slowly,
without the buzzing interi-
ority of his earlier works.
I appreciate subtlety, and
its overt fantastical nature
came across too strongly
as an allegory.
However, The Buried
Giant was evidence of
Ishiguro’s unpredicta-
bility, his willingness
to push boundaries and
experiment with new
material. In the interviews
after the book came out,
Ishiguro revealed that he
had originally intended
to set the book in a more
fixed point in time and
space, but decided to set
it in the gap in histori-
cal records about what
happened after the Roman
occupation of the British
Isles. He was attracted by
both the uncertainty over
what happened and its
distance from contempo-
rary events. Perhaps it is
a bold statement about the
universality of his themes:
fragility of memory and
relationships.
Indeed, despite his
tendency to push genres,
Ishiguro’s themes recur
time and again. In fact,
the writer himself often
maintains that he ‘writes
the same book over and
over again’. Perhaps that
is where his charm lies:
in the expression of such
universal human truths
and struggles that stand
across time and space,
manifesting and distinct
and independently enjoy-
able stories.
As a long-time Ishiguro
fangirl, I was delighted to
have a chance to meet the
writer at an event at the
Southbank Centre early
last year. Ishiguro and
David Mitchell (author of
Cloud Atlas) appeared on
stage together to discuss
writing, inspiration and
the nature of fantasy. After
the event, I got Ishiguro to
sign my hardback copy of
The Buried Giant (given to
me as a birthday present),
and told him that I really
liked his books and that
The Remains of the Day
“changed my life”. In
person, Ishiguro exuded
“Perhaps
that is where
his charm
lies: in the
expression of
such universal
human truths
and struggles
that stand
across time
and space”
an aura much like his
words: calm, unassuming,
but with an undercurrent
of a complex interior. The
only difference perhaps,
is the occasional dash of
down-to-earth humour in
person.
The Nobel Prize in
Literature is the second
most speculated upon
after the Peace prize, and
every year people place
bets on various favourites.
More or less the highest
accolade a writer can get
for a body of work rather
than winning prizes for
individual works, the prize
was given controversially
to Bob Dylan last year,
which opened up a whole
new world of speculation
as to what exactly can be
considered ‘Literature’.
Many critics suggested
that, after last year’s
unconventional choice,
the Nobel Committee
would go with a more
conventional choice this
year. Despite that, Kazuo
Ishiguro never appeared
on many of these lists of
‘conventional’ writers
tipped to win.
Indeed, the writer
himself seemed as sur-
prised at his win as the
critics, but I must say
that for me it was a very
pleasant surprise. Ishiguro
is most certainly in the
category of ‘convention-
al’ winners, but unique
perhaps because most past
winners tend to be either
less well-known by the
general public, or their
wins are of a political
nature.
For example, when the
Chinese writer Mo Yan
won in 2012, human rights
activists were not happy,
saying that he was too
close to the party, while
others said his works were
quietly subversive. People
still wonder if Salman
Rushdie will ever win the
prize, given the controver-
sial nature of his books
and the fatwa against him
for alleged irreverence
against Islam.
Ishiguro might not
be as widely popular as
Murakami, but he is still
generally well-known,
especially with the bril-
liant film adaptation of
The Remains of the Day
starring Anthony Hopkins
and Emma Thompson,
and that of Never Let Me
Go. Perhaps he will rival
Murakami in popularity
after this win. In my
opinion, Ishiguro is well
deserving of the prize,
for both the delicate,
unassuming beauty of his
language and his equally
delicate handling of the
deepest, most complex
corners of the human
psyche.
