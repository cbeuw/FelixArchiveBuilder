LADIES RUGBY
Prop
This weekend brought a hectic
schedule, after a two month
break from rugby due to adverse
weather conditions, cancel-
lations and so on, with a match
against Swansea on Saturday
and Charing X and Middlesex
Hospital on Sunday.
Swansea gave us an excellent
game with Nessie Yates making
us look set for a victory early in
the game with a run away try.
Sadly 'twas not to be with
Swansea's next five tries over-
shadowing our work concluding
the 20-4 defeat. However, the
match was enjoyed immensely
with everyone eager to get back
into the game again.
By Sunday eagerness had
dwindled with the aches, pains
and obvious bruising becoming
apparent in the stance of the
second day's turnout. Having
TABLE TENNIS
Inter-hall
Tournament
The 1984/85 Interhall
Tabletennis Tournament is due
to begin on Saturday 9 February.
Linstead, Garden, Falmouth
Keogh, Weeks and Selkirk Halls
are among the participants and
will no doubt be producing some
thrilling stuff over the next two
weeks.
Each hall team consists of
seven players, seeded in order,
and matches will be played
between the same seed
numbers. Each match will be
played on a best of three basis.
Three points will be awarded for
a win and no points for a defeat.
The maximum number of
points that any one team can
obtain is 84 (3x4x7) and the lucky
team to get closest to this figure
will be the championship winner.
Further details have already
been sent out to the team
organisers, and we shall
endeavour to keep readers in
touch with the progress of the
tournament over the coming two
weeks.
had an experienced RFU referee
the previous day Sunday's match
took on a whole new meaning
with the Hospitals' make-shift
referee Mr 'Joker' Murphy. The
Hospital side achieved four tries
with some fast, way-practiced
backline play which we had
trouble stopping. Luckily our
trusty prop Ann 'The Tank'
Burnhill bull dozed her way
through their pack managing to
out-run any attempts by the
opposition to stop her much to
everyone's surprise, to redeem
ourselves a little with a last
minute try bringing the final
score to 16-4 . Well done also to
Ann Parsons our other prop who
exhibited some determinationed
tackling and forward play.
Thanks to everyone who
turned out especially those keen
or stupid enough to appear both
days.
An appeal — intense training
in technique is required in
preparation for the national
tournament at Keele (UAU) in
March. Any offers please step
forward.
The teams are (players in seed
order):
Linstead: L Fung, S Roy-
Chowdhury, M Amechi, P
Atherton, N Ahmad, M Young,
A Aaghaakouchak
Garden: M K Li, S Barnes, T

BADMINTON
all about
nothing.
Bearing in mind the lugubrious
fact that there have been no
badminton match reports for the
past three weeks. I have decided
to put all those fervid badminton
match report readers (few as
they may be) out of their anguish.
Consequently, you now have the
non-internationally illustious
speech, 'Alternative uses of a
badminton racquet', by Mr
Christopher Bean, IC Badmin-
ton Club Captain 1984/5.
SNOOKER
Revival
Lensbury B v IC 4—8 A series of
indifferent results has left
Imperial dangerously close to the
bottom of the league and it was
important that this visit to
Lensbury, also under the threat
of relegation, should provide a
win.
The first eight frames were
shaved and so with only four left
to play both sides were still
hunting the breakthrough that
would seal the match.
Fortunately it was IC that
found the inspiration. Adrian
Feasby won both of his frames,
capturing one in style thanks to a
break of 48. John West, having
won his first frame, struggled in
the second, however, while the
rest of the team retired to the bar
resigned to the fact that John
had lost the frame he staged a
comeback and completed a very
acceptable 8-4 victory for
Imperial.
Hopefully this match will
provide a platform from which
we can lift ourselves away from
the foot of the table and clear of
the possibility of relegation.
JUDO
Friendly
Defeat
Last Wednesday, the Judo Club
went to the LSE to fight a friendly
competition.
The match was very close, but
as one fight was lost on the
decision of a slightly partisan
referee, we lost the match by
four fights to three.
Our team were Andrew
Binding, Richard Blexham, Steve
Davies, Nigel Scott, Phil
Taphouse, Chris Weedon and
Graham West.
We hope to have a return
match against LSE in a few
weeks, and to fight London
Hospital Medical School later in
the term.
Anyone interested in the Judo
Club should come to the Union
Gym between 6.30 and 9pm on
Tuesday, or in the Union bar
after 9pm. contact Kathy
Marlchan, Chem Eng 3 or Chris
Dunn Maths 2.
SAILING
Pink Team v London Hospital 2-

Blue Team v London Hospital 2-
0
Combined Team v Oxford 4-0
Once more the intrepid sailors
set off with a somewhat depleted
blue team. This did not however
deter our sturdy crew as the
results speak for themselves. It
was a beautiful sunny morning
with a gentle breeze. The first
two matches against London
Hospitals went without mishap
and we achieved several 1-2-3,
results. In the afternoon the wind
picked up—several boats
capsized. Ape successfully
maintained his record with tillers
and before long it had broken.
With a makeshift replacement he
had no better luck and he and
Andrea were soon experiencing
the delights of the Welsh Harp.
Phil and Alison finally managed
to toe them to shore and helped
them right their boat, we were
then ready to race Oxford. This
was quite exciting but proved a
fairly easy victory. With the team
working together, the results
were almost always 1-2-3.
