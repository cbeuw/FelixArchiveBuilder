Knocking
off
Mary
Thirty members of the RCS
mascotry team successfully
carried out a raid on Queen Mary
College last Tuesday to violate
their mascot Mary, a yellow and
black imitation leopard.
Armed only with a bogus
itinerary for a trip to support
QMC in the filming of University
Challenge, the RCS team posed
as QMC students to gain access
to the room where Mary was
kept. They had no problems in
removing the leopard which was
only loosely held down and
carried Mary through the
building to awaiting transport.
The whole operation was
completed in under half an hour.
RCS last stole Mary in 1982
when she was held to ransom for
eighteen months.
Theta, the RCS mascot, has
not been stolen in its ten year
history.
Barfaced cheek
Pascal Carr was shocked last Saturday when a lady accosted him in the Union Bar and proceeded to
remove her clothes. The strip-o-gram was a present from his friends.
Some regular customers in the Union Bar have observed that if women are going to indulge in this
sort of behaviour, it might be better if they were not allowed in the bar at all.
John Craven, a student in the
Department of Chemical
Engineering and Chemical
Technology, last week won the
national final of the Junior Malt
Whisky Taster of the Year
competition, held at The
Athanaeum. The first prize
consisted of a cheque for Â£ 150, an
engraved quaiche (to taste
whisky), six bottles of Macallan
ten year old, a year's subscription
to Decanter magazine and a visit
to the distillery.
The event, sponsored by the
Macallan Whisky company and
held in conjuction with Decanter
was the climax of heats held at
many Universities, each
providing one finalist. John won
the heat held at IC last term and
went on to beat stiff competition
by identifying five different malts
and correctly answering 48 out of
50 questions on the nature and
history of malt whisky.
The competition was followed
by a full Burn's Supper complete
with pipers and haggis.
