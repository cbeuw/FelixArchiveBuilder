A bore
writes
In a letter to Phil Woolas,
President of the National Union
of Students, Sir Keith Joseph,
Secretary of State for Education,
has highlighted the levels of
support for higher education
provided by taxpayers, and has
emphasised that student grants
can not be isolated from the need
to control public expenditure.
• Sir Keith said that the British
system of student support was
generous in comparison to other
countries in the western world.
He stated that parental
contributions are assessed to
provide £280 million of the total
cost of £2500 million for tuition
and research and around £800
million for student grants.
When describing the terms of
reference of a recently
announced review of financial
support for students in higher
education, he mentioned the
need to safeguard the interests of
the tax payer.
The NUS has published its
own strategy for student
financial support, calling for an
education training allowance for
all students over 16, with the
right to be reimbursed for course
related expenses and access to
rent allowances and rate rebates.
The basic rate would be fixed by a
student cost of living index and
the system would be subject to
annual review by an independent
body.
Library
up-date
Plans to introduce a bar-coding
system in the Lyon-Playfair
library have nearly been
finalised. The computerisation
should allow easier withdrawal
of books and a speedier and more
efficient service. Every book will
have a special bar-code which
can be read using a light-pen. The
system is expected to be installed
during the summer vacation.
The College's central library
will have an extra £15000 to
spend on books and periodicals
following a decision by the
Finance and Executive
Committee earlier this week. The
Haldane library is expected to
receive up to £ 1000 of this to buy
more works of fiction.
