EREVIEWS:
Teachers
Richard Mulligan plays an escaped lunatic teacher whom Nick
Noble notices as having a special gift for instruction
Teachers (Plaza)
It seems a pity that such a
w e l l r e s e a r c h e d f i l m
should be left to such a
bland p r o d u c t i o n a n d
promotion. You will have
seen it advertised as
a n o t h e r o u t r a g e o u s
American comedy in the
vein of Animal House or
Class of 84. Of course not
quite so hyped.
I did not see this as a
comedy but as a film with
more serious potential,
with that o d d hint of
dramatic comedy as used
far more successfully by
Shakespere or Pinter. This
bland production is not of
t h a t s t a n d a r d . T h e
violence, drugs, sex, police
and Teacher aspect is
corrrect but this product-
ion has managed to cram it
into another Soap Opera
plot. Included is plenty of
that, so original dramatic
corn that infects so much
modern entertainment. A s
Alex (Nick Nolte—in 48
Hours) a disillusioned
idealist attempts to get
through to a c l i c h e d ,
rebelious child, falls in love
with an ex-pupil—now a
laywer involved in a school
law case—and command
respect from his pupils and
fellow teachers.
How much more crowd
pull can you get? So a
lunatic teacher is added
(well over acted by Richard
M u l l i g a n k n o w n from
Soap). There is one good
scene as a retarded boy is
shot. The rebelious child is
played by Ralph Macchio
who has made a name for
himself in The Outsiders
and other films, but is just
another child actor. The
film reduces to Fame
standards as 'the kids' file
into the teacher's class-
room to stop him resign-
ing. A h a p p y e n d i n g
f o l l o w s with t h e last
dramatic words 'I'm a
T e a c h e r ' , f o l l o w e d by
some dramatic MOR rock
music.

SINGLES
45 *
English Evenings: / Will
Return
English evenings have
been described as a funky
Alarm and certainly this
latest single has some of
the angry excitement say
of 68 Guns but with funky
production more reminis-
cent of the Buggies! Not
their best single, but OK.
Immaculate Fools: Imma-
culate Fools
Don't know if your
remember the Bowie
single a few years back, but
I think the lead singer here
must have been well
impressed by it. This
eponymously titled song
retains a distinctly folky
b a c k g r o u n d feel (even
including Pan Pipes!) and
together with the album,
Hearts of Fortune could
herald a great deal from the
band.
Jeffery Osborne: The
Borderlines
These reviews have been
said to be adjectively
verbally overly descripitive
but sometimes it's difficult
to say anything interesting
about a disc without being
pretentious. OK, so I could
say that borderlines is
Soulful Funk and is quite
good; but does that mean
any more to anyone than
commenting that Osborne
has at last escaped the
confines of the syrup sweet
image-packing of A and M
hype with this dangerously
exciting seven inches of
electrosoul? I'm not sure.
