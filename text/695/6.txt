Ian Bull —President
Fancy being a sabbatical? It's very
difficult to answer that without
knowing what a sabbatical officer
actually does.
As a special favour to everyone
gleefully anticipating a free room
in hall and a cushy job for a year,
FELIX is providing a special cut
out and keep guide to all your
favourite sabbaticals. And if
you're one of the thousands of IC
students who aren't ICU hacks,
then hopefully you'll realise just
how much work is actually being
done on your behalf.
I aim to get into the office by 9.30.
This leaves about three hours before
lunch, which allows me to prepare
for the daily grind of committees. I
might be checking the previous
meeting's minutes, or preparing a
report. Other jobs need doing in the
m o r n i n g s . T h e P r e s i d e n t is
responsible for the permanent staff,
for instance. I had to recruit five staff
over the summer, although I hope
that next year's President won't have
this to do.
I have lunch at the Union Snack
Bar, and make sure that I'm around
between 12.30 and 1.30, when people
tend to come in with problems, or
points that they want to raise. If I
don't have a committee meeting in
the afternoon then I could easily
spend most of the rest of the day
seeing to these and meeting
personnel at Sherfield. When you
have points to raise with people at
Sherfield then it's no good seeing
them for 30 seconds. You have to
make sure that you have a few things
to see them about so you have to
keep a few things going at once.
You've got to have your facts right,
and be sensible, as well as knowing
when the interests of the students
demands that you put your foot
down.
After 5-o-clock there could be a
Major Sub-Committee. If there isn't
then I could go down to the bar, or
have a game of badminton.
Even after you think the day is over
people approach you in the bar with
c o m p l a i n t s , or r e q u e s t s f o r
autographed photos, so you're never
really off duty, even at weekends.
Self motivation is important for a
President. Maybe in the past some
have lacked this. Being President
doesn't seem to do your employment
prospects any great harm. You have
to remember that it could be a long
time before you get that level of
responsibility again. I had a pretty
good idea of what the job entailed
before I stood, although not as good
an idea as I thought. I enjoy the job.
My a d v i c e to p r o s p e c t i v e
candidates is 'Come and see me and
find out what the President really
does'.
Eric Darbyshire— Hon Sec
I tend to wake up at about 9 o'clock,
earlier if there's an Exec meeting,
later if I got pissed the previous night.
After a breakfast of Weetabix I get
into the Union Office at about 10.
Typically the first job is opening
the mail, and answering it. In the
morning I could be dealing with
transport, such as taking a minibus
to a garage, or getting some
stationery from Central Stores.
Lunch is taken at Norman's Union
Snack Bar, and I don't normally
drink, in preparation for the
afternoon.
U n i o n c o m m i t t e e s s u c h as
Finance Committee tend to take
place in the early afternoon, finishing
at 2 o'clock, and College ones later
than that.
Evenings can be taken up by Major
S u b - C o m m i t t e e s . M o n d a y ' s
Publications Board went on until
9.15, but most finish before then,
except for the notorious U L U G U C
which goes on late into the night.
After this I do some socialising in the
bar.
There are quite a few things that
are a constant drain on my time, such
as insurance, Gestetnering, or
making phone calls. Menial jobs
seem to take an inordinate amount of
time.
After being President of R C S U last
year I felt that there was a lot of
rationalisation that could be done in
the ICU, and that was one of the
reasons I stood for Hon Sec.
On the whole I think people ought
not to underestimate the work
involved, or the influence of the Hon
Sec. It's not an easy year spent in a
quiet corner of the Union Office. I'm
not sure what employers think of ex-
Hon Sees. Few of the recent ones
seem to have got good jobs on
leaving college.
If I had known what the job
entailed when I stood for it I wouldn't
have been put off.
