THIS
It's nearly the end of term
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Tis the season to be jolly falla la la.
Festive greetings in this Yuletide Cliche
Session. I'm told this issue is going to be
bursting at the seams with totally Fab
Fiction, so all I can do is weigh in with some
more.
Christmas had, in all honesty held little
significance for our hero. A plethora of gifts
and frivolities. A festival of Greed (he'd
never let greed get in his way before) but
when it came to significance, all this god bit
really didn't cut much ice. Indeed the timing
of the whole festering was coincident with a
Pagan Fest. Far more appropriate!
Never, however, had a Christmas been
more eagerly awaited. Not since the good
old days of stocking and brothers had the
count down seemed so long. Each day
opened a window in the Advent Calendar,
but each day seemed longer.
So as December entered double figures and
the term its ulimate week, he could hardly
contain himself. To help pass the time he
compiled a list of Christmas presents he
would like to receive:
Dad — a new bike
Mum — a train set
Mr Burridge — a telephone for my room
Granny F — money
Roger — interesting minutes for boring
committees
Grannie L — money
Malcolm — anything I can understand
Frank — some of his weird logic
Father Christmas — a long holiday
Merry Christmas
Merry Chris
Merry X

So the term draws to its close, and
everyone indulges in the traditional
seasoned activities: photocopying notes,
panic revising for tests and all-night report-
writing.
This past week has been Foreign
Students Week (if you didn't know — you
should have done!). Sunday was the Gluck-
Auf Celebration; everyone who came to
Stan's Real Ale Bar met our guests and
indulged in the customary international chat
over the odd drink or two.
T O D A Y is the M I N E S B A L L ! Even if
you're not going to it, Stew Vine would
greatly appreciate some assistance in
getting things ready so if you've some spare
time today roll along to the Union Office and
help.
Bernie, Simon and Trev wish everyone a
very MERRY Christmas!
J U S T A C H R I S T M A S S E C
So a decade has nearly gone by, and
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? Whilst we
might be all that much older, what have we
really achieved? Anyway, enough of these
ramblings.
Christmas is here once again, a chance to
drink everything in sight as well as catch a
little time with mum and dad. The holidays
also signal the end of a ten week term.
We all have our own favourite memories
of the term. I would like to think that your
term has been made more enjoyable by the
Union. Perhaps it was a member of a club, a
sports team etc. Whatever it was I'm glad
that we've been able to help you, and I speak
for not just the other members of the
Executive but also the officers.
What will be happening next term?
OVERSEAS STUDENTS
We will continue to try and preserve their
very numbers here. As a start we did the
leafletting of the underground last week and
have written to all members of staff.
ICWA
A number of women at College feel that
this should be disbanded. They feel that it
serves no purpose in its existing form. I will
not commit my own views to print, but will
be very interested to hear the views of any
women. Please come and tell me what you
think.
REFECTORY COMPLAINTS
I bet you cant't wait for Monday 7th
January and the chance to complain about
the quality of the food and make
constructive suggestions. O n that day the
boxes will not only be up but well displayed,
with large signs.
ELECTIONS
The spring term is the time when the
elections for all Union posts are held.
Above is just some of the things going on.
All that's left is have a marvellous holiday.
Be good!

The festive season is upon us; hordes of
students, will soon be speeding back to their
parental abode and instantaneously
become almost civilised human beings
again.
But spare a thought for those of us who
will remain at College still working
away postgraduates, o v e r s e a s
students, sabbaticals Actually, College
isn't at all a bad place without the rest of you
lot: Roger can happily sit in his office all day
revising U G M and Council policy
documents instead of having to keep
showing people how to use the badge
machine; Colin can go to sleep on Thursday
nights instead of spending all night tying
more knots in the elastic bands which hold
the FELIX paper folding machine together;
Chris can sit on his throne and survey his
kingdom without telling the rest of us what
we're doing wrong; I can curl up under my
desk and drink Newky Brown all day
without Football Club using my office every
lunchtime to rearrange their fixtures, and
we can all go down to the bar at lunchtime
without people pointing and making
comments about why we have sabbaticals
anyway.
Thanks to everyone for having helped
make ths such a good term, especially
Guildsheet for suggesting that someone buy
me a Learn-Yourself English manual — it's
not necessary, I did it at school as a second
language. Congratulations again to Roger
and Rae for both having organised
extremely successful events this term.
Happy Christmas to you all.
LST
The L S T Office will close at 1:00pm
T O D A Y (Friday). Anyone who hasn't got a
railcard by then can get one from the main
office at 117 Euston Road.
Remember, although the British Railcar
form asks for the signature of your head of
department, all you need to get a railcard
from L S T is your Union card, two
Dhotoqranhs and eight pounds.
BRENDAN
In case you hadn't heard yet, Brendan is
leaving the bar at the end of this term. O n
behalf of everyone who uses the Union Bar I
would like to wish him every happiness and
success in his new job, and also to
congratulate Jimmy on his appointment as
the new Bar Manager.
MONSTER GEORDIE XMAS PISS-
UP
Yes, this year's Annual Imperial College
Newcastle Christmas Pub Crawl will take
place on Friday 28th December, starting at
the Geordie Pride (just a few yards up a
street almost opposite Newcastle Central
Station, ask anyone for directions when you
get there) at 6:00pm. Like last year, I
promise to drink at least a pint of Scotch.
Everyone welcome, see you there!
RCS WISH EVERYBODY
A HAPPY CHRISTMAS
