L E T T E R S
THE FELIX SOCIETY
With the thirtieth anniversary of F E L I X last week, it seems
appropriate that our readers should know about the F E L I X Society,
which aims to help the Editor with the production of the paper, by way
of advice and feedback. T h e production of F E L I X is a complex
matter; not only o n the technical side, viz.proofreading, pasting-up
and collating, but also in decisions as to which copy o r material to
include, where to go for information and news, and how to achieve a
well-balanced a n d attractively presented newspaper. A n d that's
where the F E L I X Society comes in, to give a helping hand. Started by
last year's Editor, the Society is n o w fully operational, with a full
committee and a growing membership. T h e committee is organized
so as to deal with most major areas of F E L I X ; members being
delegated to deal with news, photography, finances, sports, reviews
and liason between the other media at I C and is responsible to the
Publications B o a r d of the Union; co-ordination is definitely a major
issue. Whilst major decisions o n content must rest with the Editor,
the Society c a n recommend inclusion, omission or amendment of
material requested by readers and has proved its usefulness in giving
the Editor time to include important features such as editorials, U G M
reports, etc. Next term's meetings, which you are A L L welcome to
attend,should be hot stuff indeed.so if you are interested.GO to the
F E L I X Office and either drag the Editor (Colin) out from under his
pasteups and talk to him or me.

I have made serious consider-
ation of Simon Jerome's recent
letter advocating compulsory
industrial experience between
school and university.
I agree that a 'year out' is usually
a good idea. I would suggest that a
total break from academic work is
u n w i s e , w h i l e d a y - r e l e a s e
c o u r s e s at l o c a l t e c h n i c a l
colleges my not be particularly
instructive either.
My main criticism, however, of
Mr Jerome's letter, regards his
s u g g e s t i o n that w o r k i n g in
industry makes you appreciate
university more. Unfortunately, in
my case the reverse is true. Quite
apart from t h e s p e c i a l i z e d
problems that IC students endure
to get a degree, I would probably
be irritated an any university by
living on an essentially fixed
i n c o m e , b y m i x i n g w i t h
an essentially narrow band of
society (students) and by having a
large academic workload.
Yours until G-Day

Dear Editor
Prof Bremsstrahlung has asked
me to write to you about a most
grave and disturbing matter.
Last week, two and a half years
after his retirement from FELIX,
he was astou nded to read that you
are reissuing his biography for
sale to t h e p u b l i c without
notifying him first. The Professor
wishes to remind you that
although many FELIX readers
may not remember him, he has
kept himself well o c c u p i e d
forcing back the frontiers of
knowlege, fully justifying his
continuing status as the most
brilliant intellect this side of the
Big Bang. Such an intellect is not
to be treated in such an offhand
and contemptuous manner. Even
worse, the Professor's good friend
and colleague, Mr Tony Jones, is
in a severe state of shock after the
news was broken to hm by a
scruffy urchin in a lift.
I can now reveal to you that the
Professor was intent on releasing
the contents of his genetic
manipulation laboratory into your
premises, but that I managed to
persuade hm to desist from this
precipitous action on the grounds
that the proceeds from the sale of
the book will go to a more
deserving cause than your good
self. In the circumstances, the
Professor will be satisfied with a
grovelling apology. '
Yours faithfully

Dear ICU
I hope you are aware that last
night the School of Mines had a
strip show in the Union S C R .
Many people object to this type of
'entertainment'.
It encourages men to look at
women only as objects for their
amusement, however women are
real people with minds and
personalities. Strip shows attempt
to suppress any recognition of
this fact, they instead seek to
show that a woman's physical
appearance is the only important
t h i n g a n d t h u s s e r v e t h e
exploitation of women.
Presenting women as objects
for the amusement of men
encourages men to look upon
w o m e n as t h e i r p r o p e r t y ,
women's bodies to be used at will,
the awful conclusion of this state
of mind being rape, a most violent
violation of women's rights.
It is time we questioned whether
Union facilities should be used in
this way.

Dear Colin
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all members
of IC Volleyball team for giving up
their time and (some of) their
energy to play for Imperial.
Although at the start of the term
we lost the first three matches,
once a team framework was
established we pulled off four
consecutive wins, one of which
was against U L U , and therefore
very satisfying.
Thanks go to Suki, Dave, Andy,
Marek, Lech, Henry, Peter, Bo,
Tony, Chris, Alexis and Tarn for
c o n s t a n t l y t u r n i n g out a n d
playing to win (on occasion).
Thanks also to the other
members of Volleyball Club,
particularly Sheilagh and Diane of
IF and Judith, all of whom began
playing for the first time this term,
and are rapidly improving I should
also mention Vic for supporting
us, and Carolyn forcheerleading,
writing reports, cups of coffee etc.
Anyway, Happy Christmas to
everyone, and remember that we
have two hard matches at the start
of next term, so easy on the mice
pies! Volleyball Club meet in the
Union G y m on Wednesdays
between 3:00-6:00pm and on
Sundays between 12:00-3:00pm.
New members always welcome.

Captain, IC Volleyball Club
Dear Sir,
We find it disturbing that articles
should be submitted for printing in
FELIX that contain errors which
might surely have been corrected
with a little more time and effort on
the part of the author.Being involved
in the production of FELIX this
week,our wrath was aroused by one
exceedingly long article which made
us question our faith in the ability of
our contributors to write with brevity
or even inspiration.May Santa Claus
be more liberal with gifts of articles of
a less turgid composition for the
coming year.
Yours, L. Wernberg - Moller

Dear Colin
I am writing in reply to M r
Hodgson's letter (issue 537)
concerning the advertising in last
year's Rag Mag. As Advertising
Manager last year, I do not feel that
the real problem has been given
much consideration. The root of the
problem is that we are in London and
because of this comparisons
between the advertising in our mag
and in two from provincial
universities are not possible.
Most colleges have their Rag
Mags printed by Mcmillan and
Graham who do not charge for the
printing but take in all the advertising
revenue (and make a healthy profit
from it). However, they will not
obtain advertising for any London
college, presumably because they
realise the difficulties involved in
getting advertising in London.
Last year I sent out rate cards to
about one hundred and twenty firms
and received less than ten replies,
most of which were negative.
In most cities, the students form an
integral part of the community, but
in London there are so many
different colleges that shops are not
prepared to advertise for one
particular college. M o and I went
round a lot of local shops (on High St
Ken, Gloucester Rd, Knightsbridge
and Old Brompton Rd) and obtained
four adverts. This was due partly to
the general lack of interest in
advertising and, to a large extent, to
the number of chain stores we found.
One final point is that last year the
advertising did not start until
June/July, whereas this year the Rag
Committee should be electing the
Advertising Manager at the first
meeting next term. In fact, M r
Marshall tells me that he will be
definitely proposing M r Hodgson as
Advertising Manager of the next Rag
Mag at this meeting.
Yours sincerely
Tansy Hepton
Dear Sir
I apologise to the individuals
about whom I made uncompli-
mentary remarks in my last letter.
Their amusing reply puts me to
shame. Secondly, I want to
amplify my remark concerning
affiliation to political groups.
Under the present system of
automatic membership student
unions are funded directly by the
taxpayer. Hence, union funds
should only be used for the
purpose for which they are given,
namely, promoting the well-being
of students. Students are rightly
concerned with political issues
but a student union should not
support, using taxpayer's money,
o r g a n i s a t i o n s that are not
p r i n c i p a l l y c o n c e r n e d with
students' interests.
