To encode a word using a PLAYFAIR
codesquare proceed as follows. Construct a 5x5
square of letters beginning with the code word,
which must have no recurring letters, continue
with the rest of the letters in the alphabet except
J. I does for I and J .
Ex — Codeword — outspreadingly.
Code Square:
o a T S ?
R A 1
N G L Y 3
C F H K h
a V w X Z
To encode a word, which must have an even
number of letters, split'it into pairs of letters. If a
pair of letters both appear in the same column
take the letters appearing directly below them IN
ORDER. If a pair are in the same row, take the
letters to the right (OR, if at the end of a row or
column the letter at the beginning or top). If not,
take the respective opposite corners of the
rectangel, obtained by the pair.
Eg 1 D E L A W A R E - DE/LA/WA/RE
DE-» IA
L A * H L
WA-»TL
RE-»EA
Eg 2 SWINGS - SW/IN/GS
SW-»TX N O T X T which would be WS
IN-»RB
GS-»YU
Puzzle: Having solved all the clues and completed
the diagram, notice that the leading and reverse
diagonals are all white squares, the first six
letters and the last three letters of the leading
diagonal and the first letter and last four letters of
the reverse diagonal are to be compared with the
letters of the phrase "Sean wishes you a drunken
Christmas", where they appear when the phrase
is spelt out along the diagonals in order, not ehe
middle H appears one (twice!). Compare the
required letters in pairs (ie the last letter of 35
across and the first letter of 8 down make a pair).
This S H O U L D yield seven pairs of code
equations from which the code square used in the
first place is to be deduced! Having reconstituted
the code square, the code word(s) (ten non-
recurring letters) is to be read. The first solver to
send in the code word(s) and complete diagram to
FELIX and to my satisfaction wins £5.
All clues are normal apart from scientific
definitions at 1 across, 10 down and 8 down.
