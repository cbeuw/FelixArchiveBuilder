CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
Issue No. 538
PRIME MINISTER GIVES
A FIVER TO ICU RAG
On the occasion of the Guild's Rag Carol singing; a visit
was made to a well known residence in Downing Street.
While they sang there, The Prime Minister, Margaret
Thatcher, arrived and donated Five Pounds to this year's
ICU Rag Collection. She gave the money to Chandra
Kumar Patni, an overseas student at the college; possibly
an ironic action in view of the recent education cuts which
particularly affect Overseas Students.

GUILDS XMAS UGM
Guilds held their Christmas
U G M on Monday and part of the
meeting concerned proposed
changes to Guilds' constitution.
The proposed change, that voting
should change to a paper ballot,
was passed on its first hearing, but
must be passed by a two-thirds
majority at a second U G M before
it is accepted.
During the meeting Sarah
McGuiness was ratified as the
new Guilds Honorary Secretary
and Nab Kalsi reported that
£4,000 for Rag. The meeting
closed with a slide show and a visit
from Father Christmas.

U G M on Monday, Vice-President
Tansy Hepton reported that over
£5,800 had been collected for Rag
so far this year. The meeting also
h e a r d B a r n e y M c C a b e ' s
resignation from R C S U Ents
Committee and a motion of
censure was passed on Zosia for
failing to notify anyone that the
meeting was taking place until the
morning of the meeting. The
base for the three-handled pot
was donated by Chris Fox, Martin
Watson and J o n Hall. The meeting
was finally closed with a Kangola.
LEAFLETTING IN THE
UNDERGROUND
Last Friday afternoon, thirty
students from the College went to
Victoria Station to distribute
leaflets about the proposed
education cuts. After fifteen
minutes, Guilds President J o
Armitage was challenged by a
constable who had apparently
been in consultation with the
British Rail Area Manager. He
s u g g e s t e d that she o b t a i n
permission to continue from the
area manager, but when she did
so it was refused and the
leafletters moved out of the
station to continue leafletting
outside the station. Soon they
were asked to leave station
property and the IC coffin was
carried back to IC. London
Transport refused to allow it on
the tube.
ACTRESS FROM STANS
Actress and barmaid Sarah
Kenyon had her first lucky break
on Monday, when she was offered
her first part as a professional
actress.
Sarah, a recent arrival in Stan's
Real Ale Bar, will be leaving after
only five weeks to travel to Belfast,
where she will be appearing at the
Lyric Theatre in Wedekinde's The
Awakening of Spring.
After studying with the Welsh
College of Music and Drama, Sarah
came to London to begin her
career in the entertainment
business. She was fortunate
enough to find an agent soon after
arriving.
ICU COUNCIL MEETING
The final ICU Council meeting
of this term was held on Monday
night. The report prepared by the
PWP concerning Union places in
hall, put to Council as a motion
was accepted and as a result of
this the chairmen of the Overseas
S t u d e n t s , S o c i a l C l u b s ,
Recreational Clubs and Athletic
Clubs committees, Publication
Board and Rag plus the ICWA
President will not be allocated
Union places in hall next session.
Council also decided to adopt
the adventrue playground in Holly
Street, Hackney, this having been
previously worked on as part of
Environmental Week, and IC
students are expected to pay a
working visit to the site on 19th
January. Decisions were also
taken to hold the last council of
next term at Silwood Park, the
College field station and to donate
£50 to the A c t i o n A g a i n s t
Education Cuts Committee.
Following Council, it now looks
as though the censorship of
records by the Haldane Library
will be referred to a board of
studies meeting, though there
was some talk of possible action,
such as an occupation, being
taken in protest at the decision
made by the record librarian.
The Positive Alternatives To
Abortion Society has now been
accepted as a member of S C C ,
this being decided at Council, in
addition to this, the Union is to
press for the number of places
available for reapplicants for halls
to be reduced from ten to five
percent.
