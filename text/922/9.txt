17 January 1992 Felix 922 Music
Where did you get the name for
the band from, I know it has
something to do with the Kenneth
Anger film?
It was on a long list of other names,
and we picked that because of the
imagery of the film you know,
Scorpio Rising w e ' d sort o f
associate ourselves with that, you
know, that sort of imagery. A n d
that's why basically, it's quite
simple. W e l l , umm, anyone got a
light, sorry.
I thought you sounded like Primal
Scream, on the album.Is that
intentional?
Na, N a it's just that you know, the
thing with that is that it's just a
d i r e c t i o n , y o u can see that
that' s... you know it' s a change not
to hear Ned's Atomic Dustbin.
Do you intend to follow Primal
Scream, into the Loaded thing?
No, they follow us...no we do our
own things...yeah I suppose just
like they have their bit... that's their
mentality. They've got their own bit
we've got ours, whether we do two
things that are the same I mean,
well they won't be. They went
through that relief thing where they
changed a lot of things hopefully
we'll be able to do that in the future.
Is techno really the only
interesting thing around?
It's not the only interesting thing,
I prefer the guitar sound, it sounds
very nice, y o u k n o w . . .
Theoretically though it's the only
new thing that had happened
musically, truly you know, new.
That's all we meant... you know,
Techno is totally new like, well like
guitar playing was new in '66. Well
it can be taken two ways really you
can look at it as something new
which therefore is good or you can
look at it as something new which
is shit whichever is the way you
look at it. The trouble with techno
is that it pushes people down you
know it's not, it's music for people
who are dead heads...it's used by
so many people you know... some
of it's really bad, especially the E
culture inside especially with all the
opiated E that's going into it, it's
getting everyone into smack... It
makes people be ordinary, it's like
muzak. Sometimes when you hear
it and one minute it's brilliant and
makes your hair stand on end/then
that all...what was it country and
western for the red- necks. It's like
err E generation C & W , but it is
new. Well you know all forms of
guitar music have been done, apart
from ours
Well what is your influence?
I'm rather more influenced by the
effect a group's had rather than
what they sound like. Y o u know,
there is only so much you can do
with guitar and a set of drums, but
the singing really should make
people think. It should sound
brilliant and aggressive and get
inside people because you listen to
the words of the song, it means
something to you after a couple of
times of listening to the words. Y o u
know what they're singing about
and if you don't get it right you
make up your own meaning for it.
You've then got something personal
with the song , you can listen to that
indie stuff and you can't understand
the words, as they're aren't any
really. Or the words that there are
are just pop blab. It's all quirky little
catchphrases.
What is your message then?
Think for yourself, you know and
listen to this, it's really loud and
really cool, yeah. That's about it
really. Y o u know the way I write
songs is to try and use words that
people wouldn't normally use. Well
we want to be exciting and
dangerous and sound wise and well
mentally stimulating. W e don't
write songs for other people you
know we just do it ourselves. W e
don't say like lets sound like the
Charlatans this week and just record
like I'm sure many other bands do.
We're not in any scene really you
know.
Did George Bush's collapse scare
you at all?
No not at all really. I think Dan
Q u a y l e w o u l d make a fine
president.
Would you like to see a punk
revival?
Na, it's a pile of shit, pub rock,
played by kids you know. I mean
when it was in its time it was
brilliant but musically it's nothing
it's shit. It used to be good but it's
gone, it's totally gone you know. It
was more important than disco but
personally you know I don't like the
sound of it. I'm more a Genesis,
Police sort of fan.
What's the worst gig you've
played?
Milton Keynes, no, no that was
good that was the best one. Derby,
Derby that was a horrible gig. We
did the Charlton gig the day after
we'd played U L U , we went down
there like as stars it was brilliant
there were people all over the stage
you know we went down as well as
anything and that was our 99th gig
and we thought that our next gig
was going to be even better and then
we played at this youth club yeah
it was like a labour club and there
was kids in the audience... needless
to say that we've not got the same
agent now.
When is the next time you're
coming to London.
We're playing the Marquee in early
March, so that's about a month and
a bit away.
What do you want the last line to
be of your interview?
Marijuana, fuck, Satan, kill, dogs
and err what's the other one? We
are coming to eat your children.
The end.
The Lise Yates
interview.
Do you remember when Primal
Scream were good ?
Eeeeek, Loaded!
No before that, do you remember
the first album?
Eeeeek, Screamadelica.
N o , Primal Scream. W h e n
Primal Scream were a group with
guitars. They were good then, you
know.
Eeeeek, Higher Than The Sun,
that's good.
N o it's not. N o w sod off, and
stop interrupting. I'm trying to
review this. This sounds like the
Primal Scream of that era, the
Primal Scream we, I, knew and
love. With guitars, and melodies,
and lyrics, and I'm beginning to
sound like my Dad. What's more,
it has become the new resident on
my record deck, forcing Carter
back into its sleeve. The A side's
very good, but I can't tell you the
titles, as no-one's told me. A l l the
songs on it are great, and I think
two of them are called Freedom. So
there. It's a lot better than
Screamadelica.
Eeeeek, No it's not.
