ULU Football
The following tables show the
relative positions (up till 23rd
December) of the Imperial College
football teams in the University o f
London Intercollegiate Leagues
1991-1992. A s can be seen all the
teams are doing reasonably well,
except for the 5ths w h o are
languishing near the bottom o f the
Fourth Division. The 2nds and the
4ths have both got good chances of
promotion if they can sustain their
form till the end of the season.
Four Little Dragons
Many of you Imperial College
students think o f places like
Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Korea as mysterious, far-
eastern countries to which you will
never travel. Certainly the cost o f
travel is high and the distances
large, but they are well worth the
investigation and make good
holiday destinations.
As a person from that region o f
the world, I can tell you that the
variety o f the cuisine would
o v e r w h e l m a gourmet. T h e
shopping makes a mockery of the
sales currently on in this country,
because prices are so low.
Furthermore, the economic
success o f these countries makes
them no less comfortable to live in
than any other western country. Not
more than forty years ago these
places were b a c k w a r d and
underdeveloped. Today, they have
caught up with the West and have
economic growth rates far faster
than any western country. Hence
their collective name o f the 'Four
Little Dragons'.
I write this article to attract you
to an exhibition, held by the
Chinese, Singaporean, Taiwanese
and Korean societies. A lot of effort
has been put into this exhibition,
which will have food and show
culture, including caligraphy. D o
take a look. The exhibition will take
place in the J C R on 24th January.
