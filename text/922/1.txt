A Very Select Committee
M e m b e r s o f the House o f
Commons Education, Science and
Arts Committee visited Imperial
College on Wednesday to look into
student poverty. T h e acting
chairman, Sir Gerard Vaughan M P ,
said that allegations of hardship
amongst students last summer had
caused c o n c e r n and needed
examination.
The Committee, comprised of
seven Conservative M P s and five
Labour M P s , had a brief to look
into whether some groups of
students were affected by low
incomes more than others; whether
the maintenance grant and loan
system provide adequate finance;
whether the access fund was
adequate and properly administered
and whether vacation or part time
work should play a part in student
support.
After talks with the College
administration, the C o m m o n s
Committee met with members of
the IC student Union Hardship
committee, who gave numerical
evidence of average student income
and expenditure. Zoe Hellinger, IC
Union president asked why the
Commons Committee was only
visiting Imperial College and no
David Evenelt, Sir Gerard Vaughan and Patrick Thompson, MPs of the Committee.
other U n i v e r s i t y . M r M a r t i n
Flannery M P responded by saying
that the report of the committee had
to be produced quickly - preferably
before Easter. M r Gerry Steinberg
M P later told Felix that this was
because the findings o f the
Committee would be wasted i f a
general election was called after the
Easter recess.
M s H e l l i n g e r and G r a h a m
Lawton presented the preliminary
findings of the survey conducted
over Monday and Tuesday, which
received just under 5% response
from IC students.
A number of IC students were
asked to attend, and amongst the
issues raised was the time taken for
student loans to come through. M r
Steinberg expressed surprise as he
said his 'daughter had got it within
24 hours o f a p p l i c a t i o n ' in
Nottingham. It was suggested that
the delay was due to College
processes.
One member of the Commons
Committee reported that previously
a College administrator had said
that students should rely on their
parents until 21 years o f age. This
notion was refuted by the assembled
students, who added that bringing
back housing benefit for students
would be the single most important
piece o f financial help the
Government could bring. Most
students said that it was very
difficult to cope financially and
vacation work never paid enough to
make a significant dent in the
overdraft. They said that overdrafts
of a hundred pounds or more were
considered a fact o f life.
Security Staff Roundup
The fate of the College security and
messenger staff will soon be
decided. The College's Governing
body will take the decision on
whether or not to implement
proposals to sack 88 security staff
at its next meeting on 22 January.
Negotiations are still continuing
even though the C o l l e g e
adtninstration and the
manufacturing unions officially
ended negotiations last Wednesday
8th January. The Rector, Sir Eric
A s h , met Trade U n i o n
representatives on the morning of
Wednesday 15th January, and gave
them a 'sympathetic' hearing,said
Ian French, of the Manufacturing,
Science and Finance Union, and
Mick Saul of the National Union of
Public Employees. They both added
that the Rector said he would prefer
an in-house security system but
financial considerations had to be
taken into account.
The Rector will be also receiving
a report from Gordon Marshall,
director o f Estates, through
Caroline Fox, Personnel director.
M r Marshall described this report
as factual, covering the negotiation
process and c o n t a i n i n g
recommendations that were 'too
complex to describe in detail'. M r
Steve N e w b o l d , Management
Spokesperson, emphasised that the
report from Gordon Marshall was
'advisory' but that it would contain
the original proposals to sack
security and messenger staff.
The situation has not been helped
by the release o f the new college
telephone directory, which does not
include any departmental messenger
staff. Although this was described
by Gordon Marshall as 'clearly a
mistake' and Steve N e w b o l d
expressed surprise that 'anyone
would do something as provocative
as that d e l i b e r a t e l y ' . M i c k
S a u l . ( N U P E ) , commented that
those staff at risk had also been left
out )f a statement o f wages o f
College staff which was released
recently, and they had not been
measured for new uniforms which
usually occurs at this time o f year.
The Rector met heads o f all
Departments yesterday and it is
expected that this meeting will form
the basis for any proposal
recommended to the Governing
body.
