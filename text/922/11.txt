V.I. Warshawski
Okay, here's the story. Kathleen
Turner (self-confessed 'hottest
woman in Hollywood', arf arf)
plays V I Warhawski, who I ' m
reliably informed is a 'tough-
talking, fiercely independent, sexy
P . I . ' .
Let's take that one part at a time,
shall we? First up, M s . Turner is
not the hottest w o m a n in
Hollywood; she's one o f those
secondary celebrities trapped in the
half-way hell o f mediocrity.
Second, V I Warshawski isn't
tough-talking (she just looks that
way). Third, 'fiercely independent'
means, in this context, a few lines
thrown in for authenticity. Fourth,
'sexy' .. well, each to their own, I
guess.
Warshawski strikes up a casual
flirtation with an ex-hockey player
(would you believe it?) and hey! he
gets wiped! A n d furthermore! he
has! a young daughter! who is at
risk from a sinister conspiracy for
money and land! Drug-dealers and
real- estate dealers, scum o f the
earth, that's what I say. Y o u can
work out the rest (God, I love that
sentence. It's saved me so much
drudgery over the years).
So V I goes to work, armed with
only her self-righteousness and a
series of annoyingly trite messages
about succeeding in the man's
world of the private eye biz. A s she
does so, she uses what might be
generously termed 'feminine wiles';
if you prefer, she tarts about.
And that's really where this film
falls apart. The script is pretty
dreadful, reeking o f every half-
assed cliche in Jim McCliche's B i g
Book O f Cliches; in fact, everything
hinges on the fact that V I is a
woman. Not just any woman, she's
supposed to be intelligent and
independent, so how come this boils
down to batting your eyelids in
times of danger and genital-injury
self-defense ? Hell, I can do that,
but no-one's making a movie about
me.
A no-no. If you're really an
intelligent and independent woman,
run like hell.
The Flying, Intelligent,
Independent (and Male) Gerbil
Freddy's Dead
Queen gags aside, this film really
is pretty poor. Okay, Queen gags
included. It's set ten years from
now when all but one of the E l m
Street kiddies has bit the big one
(ooer) and the final dude is nearly
crazy. He ends up in a juvenile
rehabilitation asylum and meets a
few new bits o f claw fodder and a
couple o f psychiatrists who even
half believe him for'a change. The
kid has no memory so it's back to
Springwood (Freddy ville) for
revelations of Freddy's past and a
few stiffies (fwooar). W h o is
Freddy's child? H o w did he get his
dream powers? Who. gives a toss?
Why is it 'Freddy's Dead' when he
was dead in the first film? W h y did
Wile E . Coyote always fall for the
'tear through the painting' gag?
Buggered if I know (save the
Freddy bits)!
There are only four deaths in the
movie (including Freddy), and
Freddy dies in 3D!! That crap red-
green 3D that barely worked on T V
a few years back, and then only the
last ten minutes of the film. The plot
changes from special effects a-go-
go to A-team slug out between
Uncle Fred and his fickle baby
(plenty o f gratuitous knives,
baseball bats, etc. pointing out of
the screen). Nice cameos by that git
who's engaged to Winona Ryder
(not any more - Ed. Ha ha ha) (who
had scissors for fingers), a bloaty
sarcastic stumpy 'comedienne', and
an ageing rocker (School's Out
dudes). The effects are pretty cool
and the first death is very funny
P L U S over the end credits all the
best effects from the whole set of
nightmares are shown (the poster
was right, they saved the best till
last).
A right poor film that's just there
to grab your cash. It may be the last
film for Freddy but be prepared for
Freddy - the next generation.
