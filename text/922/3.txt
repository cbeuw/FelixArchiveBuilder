editorial
In Tuesday's Guardian there was a
feature concerning the possible
break-up of the federated University
of London. Defederalisation seems
to be very fashionable nowadays,
though I expect the process would
be slightly more gentlemanly here
than in ex-Yugoslavia. There are a
lot o f arguments for and against
defederalisation which I am not
going to repeat here - mainly
because I don't know them - but I
will repeat a quote from D r Derek
Roberts, provost o f University
College.
It sounds elitist, and it is. If
anyone beleives that to get a first
class degree in one o f the not-so-
good polytechnics produces the
same quality of education and the
same quality o f people as, say,
Imperial, they are either stupid or
barking.'
In my experience, admittedly
limited to two summer vacation jobs
and a year or two trying to find a
real job (as a number of people
somehow don't consider working
80 hours a week a real job), the fact
that I have an 'Imperial' degree is
completely irrelevant. Unless you
intend to f o l l o w the exact
specifications of your degree for the
rest o f your life in your career, an
'Imperial' degree may be a positive
handicap. This may in part be due
to the intensive method of teaching,
but also in part to the type of student
this place attracts. I really don't
know.
Sabbatical Elections.
Our own, home-grown leaders o f
the future will be exalted to high
office soon. Y o u too can watch their
innocence corrupted to a vile
morass of self interested power
cravings and cynical manipulations,
machiavellian in their subtlety, until
their over inflated egos explode in
a shower o f nepotism and self-
congratulatory sycophancy.
Unfortunately due to IC Union
election rules, I am not allowed to
release all the information I might
know about any one o f the
candidates. Apart from making the
campaign tedious, it means that
you, the electorate, don't have all
the information required to elect a
suitable candidate. Since I don't
have much respect for rules or
accepted conduct, I would just
ignore them, but this might mean
an annulment o f the election, a re-
run and generally a difficult life for
all involved.
Anybody wishing to stand for the
post o f I C U President, Deputy
President, Honorary Secretary
(Events) or Felix editor should see
their respective predecessors and
despair. Papers go up on February
17, hustings will be held at St
Mary's on March 2 and at Imperial
on March 5. Voting will occur on
9 and 10 March.

Pissing Off Important People
Dear Adam,
After the recent industrial
problems with the
messengers/security staff at
Imperial I have a minor rant that I
would if possible like to see
published on the matter in general
as I think that the real issue has been
grossly clouded, I hope you will
bear with me:
Imperial College is in desperate
financial straits. It has no money at
all. It needs to make some savings
if it is to remain a viable concern.
I don't think that too many people
would disagree with the essence o f
the above but the worrying trend at
the moment is to make the place
into a money making body without
any thought for what this place
actually stands for. This is an
educational institute first and
foremost and the welfare of the
students should be its paramount
concern. O n campus we now have
a conference centre occupying a
large section of a student residence
building when we are short of
housing, the sports centre is being
turned into a general London
facility and large areas of the
campus that could be used as
teaching areas are rented out to
outside companies.
On top of all this it seems that
every service that we have in
college from our security service to
our catering outlets are being forced
along the road to outside tender, a
solution that provides a short term
cash prize but jeopardizes the very
fabric of the institution by providing
us with permanent staff who have
no loyalty to the college, who
cannot be vetted by college and who
are ultimately beyond the control of
the college. Moreover I suspect that
a few years down the line college
will find itself in a very poor
negotiating position and the cost of
this little exercise will prove to be
a rather bigger bite than it intended
to chew.
There is a bit o f a problem
however, security is crap.
Some attempts are being made to
improve it, for example the wipe
card system being installed, but this
is approaching the problem from the
ass end. The real problem is in the
staff. I can think o f at least two
members of the daytime security
force who spend most of the day in
one bar or another in a state of
partial i n e b r i a t i o n . . . O N
O V E R T I M E ! There is no daytime
security as such anyway, in the
daytime they are messengers and if
they are the night time staff they are
on overtime.
The solution to this problem lies
straight at the feet of the college
management. It is a reorganisation
of security, which ought to include
the -firing o f the incompetent
members of the staff, the promotion
of the good members and i f
necessary the hiring o f new staff to
fill any gaps. I don't think the union
would object to firing a member of
security for being pissed on duty!
A taut system would be more
efficient, cheaper and would not
have the effect of alienating and
angering a large number o f the
college's staff apart from those (in
many cases very competent and
loyal) who would have their lives
totally turned upside down in the
middle of a period o f recession
where jobs are scarce.
The way I see it college
management are taking a problem
that they are not competent to
handle and throwing it into a
someone else's problem field for a
short term hump on the balance
Getting
Dear Adam.
I'm getting fed up with people
using your letters page to argue
about whether Christianity is true
or not. and trying to prove or
disprove it. I don't believe this can
be done. Christianity is about a
relationship, and as such is a matter
for experience. Let me illustrate
with a story...
I have a friend called Jim. Y o u
have never met Jim, and only have
my word that he exists. I cannot
prove his existence to you, nor can
you disprove it. I can present
evidence; so can you. W e can each
explain away or disregard the
evidence put forward by the other,
and it is unlikely that this exercise
will change anyone's viewpoint.
Only when you meet J i m for
sheet. Thought for the day, perhaps
they are the people that should be
fired and replaced by outside tender
since they seem incapable o f
performing, perhaps they are a
useless money drain o n the
college's account?
N . B . Before people start
complaining that I have not signed
this I would like to point out that I
am a student and I have just pissed
off some very important people.
Thankyou for bearing with me.
Name withheld by request.
Fed Up
yourself (assuming he is happy to
meet you) will my claim be
substantiated. But I won't have
proved it. Jim will have proved his
own existence.
...So let's have no more of this
proof and disproof, claim and
counterclaim—it's all so much hot
air. Christians, please don't push
Jesus d o w n people's throats.
Atheists/agnostics/people of other
faiths, please stop trying so hard to
prove us wrong—it can't be done.
Can we all just respect each
other's personal integrity and let it
drop? D o people have no other
concerns to write about?
Yours.
