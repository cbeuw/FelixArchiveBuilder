investment by firms. Strict rules
will ensure that the investment is
genuinely additional. O n top of the
current 100% allowances for R & D ,
companies w i l l be awarded
additional 25% tax credit for
investment made over and above
that made in a base year.
The policy will be progressively
revised to incorporate all investment
in innovation including design and
technology transfer.
The 'Scientists in Britain' policy
will have a considerable impact. It
will create a genuine incentive for
new investment, and bring Britain
into line with the U S A , Japan and
France, whilst meeting European
Community requirements which
limit research grants to 25% of cost.
To complement the 'Scientists in
Britain' scheme, technology trusts
will be established throughout the
country during the course of the
next Labour government. These
technology trusts will be run by
technologists and business people,
and will bring together universities,
industrialists, financiers and
government.
The technology trusts will have
three main aims.
1. To improve the quality of
technology transfer to smaller
firms, ensuring that they have ready
access to the best of the world's new
technologies.
2. To open up laboratories and
their technicians to help small and
medium sized firms turn their ideas
into commercial products.
3. T o help in the commercial
utilisation of ideas developed by
universities and polytechnics in
their area.
Again, the technology trusts will
build strength into the economy.
Skills and Training.
Bridging the skills gap is a crucial
factor in recovery, and Labour's
'Skills in the 90s' programme will
bring together the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) and the
Department of Employment to do
this. A Labour government will
create a coherent national training
policy. Labour will introduce a
minimum training Contribution to
prevent the bad employer riding
free on the back of the good.
Companies should not be able to get
a competitive edge by poaching the
workers other companies have
trained. W e will therefore ensure
that those employers who do not
pay thier fair share contribute
instead to local training funds.
Young people will have a right to
learn under Labour. W e will give
a much higher priority to the
development of National Training
Q u a l i f i c a t i o n s , and prevent
employers taking on 16 to 19 year
olds without a proper training
contract.
In addition to these measures to
improve training, L a b o u r is
working on proposals to create a
University for Industry, building on
Labour's expertise and success in
setting up the Open University.
Plans are being drawn up in close
collaboration with industry, higher
education, training and
broadcasting institutions to create a
modern high tech university to
deliver a wide range of courses.

Backing British Exports.
Britain has always been a trading
nation. Our prosperity has rested on
our ability to sell goods to the
world. Export led growth is the
only guarantee of sustainable
growth.
A L a b o u r government w i l l
introduce four measures to provide
the basis for export led growth in
the 1990s.
1. We will create a revitalised and
integrated export service combining
the trade functions of the D T I ,
Foreign Office, and the British
Overseas Trade Board.
2. We will ensure through our
one stop advisory network that
small firms wanting to export have
a single point of access to market
information, advice and assistance.
3. Labour will launch regional
export drives in B r i t a i n in
collaboration with Chambers of
C o m m e r c e and regional
development agencies.
4. W e w i l l encourage
A m b a s s a d o r s and other U K
representatives abroad to deepen
their knowledge of British export
industries and become more active
in their support.
Greening Industry.
The great challenge of the 1990s is
to modernise industry to make it
environmentally friendly. A Labour
government will announce urgent
measures.
New national and European
research programmes w i l l
encourage the development of new
e n v i r o n m e n t a l technologies,
including application of information
and biotechnology. Technology
trusts will be encouraged to play a
leading role in helping small and
medium sized firms adopt more
energy efficient and waste reducing
processes. N e w l a b e l l i n g
procedures will also be introduced
•to provide consumers with full
information about the
e n v i r o n m e n t a l and energy
implications of products.
To provide maximum public
focus for the Greening of Industry,
L a b o u r w i l l launch a Great
Environment Exhibition in year
three o f the first K i n n o c k
government. This will provide a
platform and showcase for the new
environmental technologies and
give British industry an incentive to
become a world leader in the
environment.
Backing British Industry.
Labour is the only party which
recognises the central part that
manufacturing must play in our
future prosperity. Labour believes
that Britain is at its best when we
use our people's inventive genius to
make goods and sell them to the
w o r l d . A n d we k n o w that
government has a positive role in
helping industry to make it happen.
Only a Labour government would
be fit and able to do this. Labour
has listened to British business and
industry. We have looked at the best
examples of what our competitors
are doing. Labour has worked out
a real programme for recovery.
On the Road.
Labour's campaign has hit the road.
Next Monday, we will be in
Yorkshire, and in the East Midlands
on Friday. On Monday 27 January,
Labour will be back in London and
the South East.
Labour is now telling the country
about its policies for sustainable
recovery and stable growth. A l l we
need now is for John Major to go
to the country.
