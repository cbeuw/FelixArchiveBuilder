The driver of the car that broke the
leg of Stephen Dorman during a
mascotry kidnap attempt last term
will not be charged by the police.
The police were considering
pressing charges of 'reckless
driving' and 'driving without due
care' against the driver, who
received a letter on Saturday stating
that 'after consideration' no action
would be taken.
The police are believed to have
taken into account that M r Dorman
did not wish to see charges pressed,
and that other witnesses to the
accident gave favourable statements
to the police.

Over 20 thefts have occurred on and
around campus since the beginning
of the year.
Stolen items include wallets,
cash, cheque books and two fax
machines. One of the fax machines
was stolen from the C i v i l
Engineering department and the
other from the Chemistry building.
Other items stolen from that
department include a stereo hi-fi
system and a compact disc player.
The Sherfield building has also
suffered a spate of attacks since the
start of the year, with the theft of
The number of companies attending
the 'milk round', which puts many
students in contact with employers,
has halved in the past two years.
A n article published in New
Scientist on the 4th February claims
that the number of employers
participating in the 'milk round' at
Imperial College has dropped due
to excessive charges to participating
companies.
M r John Simpson, Director of the
Careers Advisory Service, said that
the article had created adverse
publicity for potential students, and
that the charging policy had been in

The ex-members of the Royai
College of Science Union ( R C S U )
who removed the R C S U mascot,
Theta. last November in protest
against the new mascotry rules will
face no disciplinary action, although
the incident almost caused a fight
in the bar.
A Union disciplinary committee
held last week decided that as there
was no actual violence as a result
of the incident, and as the
ownership of Theta could not be
proved by the R C S U , no action
could be taken.
For this latter reason the 'theft'
cannot be reported to the police.

the Careers Service. M r Simpson
commented that this year's drop in
numbers was much less than other
universities were experiencing. He
emphasised the importance of the
'milk round' in providing jobs to
graduates, and said that a change in
the pricing system was being
considered.
Zoe Hellinger, Union President,
said that she would be pressing
several points about the operation
of the careers service with M r
Simpson in the very near future.

Students and staff at Silwood Park,
part of Imperial College near
Heathrow Airport, are said to be
concerned about the price increases
in their refectory.
The last price rise was
implemented at the start of the new
term and is the third increase in
three months. College management
have received complaints from
members of staff at Silwood, and
have noticed that many students are
boycotting the refectory.
Silwood's accommodation and
catering manager, M r . Parsons,
refused to comment on the recent
increases and the affected students
have yet to decide whether to take
formal action.
