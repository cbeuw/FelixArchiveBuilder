Senseless Things- Easy to Smile Mega City 4 - Stop EP
This 12" comes with a Jamie
Hewlitt print from the back cover.
It's a lovely print. £3.50 for an art
print. Admit it. you pay more than
that from the guy down the South
Kensington subway, don't you?
And this isn't just a boring black
and white picture of someone on a
railway platform. N o , it's in colour.
Record? What record. O h , got it.
Another cut from the First O f Too
Many album. Just your average
indie sound. Nothing particularly
outstanding. Nothing particularly
obnoxious. Lovely print though.
Lise Yates.
What is the world coming to? There
used to be things you could rely on,
that a British summer is when the
rain gets two degrees warmer, that
the Conservatives will cock up the
economy and that Mega City Four
records will do serious, and I mean
serious, damage to you ears. Well,
one of these is no longer true. On
the back cover is a little comment
that they are against hard drugs,
does this mean they condone soft
'ones? P r o b a b l y . They have
certainly mellowed out a lot since
the last time I saw them when one
particularly energetic member of
the audience decided that climbing
up on the speaker stack and
throwing himself off the top was
fun. He got about as for as the
Wright brothers' early efforts. Why
is this? I hear you ask. W e l l , you
can answer that one yourself.

The Magic Box 2
The Senseless Things, on a roof.
So what do we have in the magic
box for you this week. The Fat
Lady Sings are an Irish rock group,
who more prestigious publications
than this have described as
'Ireland's finest band' ( N M E ). I'll
be there and I ' l l be looking out for
you. There's a disco at the union if
you don't want to exert yourself,
but just want to be pathetic.
Nothing on Saturday, I'm afraid.
I'd stay in and watch Brazil if I were
you. Oh no, home alone.
As for Harlesden, I doubt that
any of the R S M rugby team would
go there alone, so I suggest that you
go with a friend.
Poddy Music E d .
Ents Rave
As I was upstairs all night with all
the hyper cool and trendy people I
can't comment on Flood, or the two
other groups that supposedly played
that nobody know about. The crap
hardcore' dance music that is
somehow making it in the charts
was nowhere to be heard. It was
pure techno, rave, heavy house
here. The sort of beats that measure
8.9 on the Richter scale and if you
feet didn't move here you have no
soul. What more can I say, I had
a great and groovy time and my legs
have only just recovered.

Flood peformed during the New
Year's Carnival last Friday night.
The dictionary defines 'flood' as:
'inundate, irrigate, deluge with
water, fill to overflowing, come in
great quantities.'
Taking these definitions in the
ever traditional reverse order—they
were a four-piece band, so they
didn't come in great quantities. The
Ents lounge certainly wasn't filled
to overflowing, but they did have
an audience of over thirty for the
whole performance. N o one was
deluged with water, though it may
have crossed the minds of some of
the audience. Irrigate, er, I'll pass
on that one. A n d finally inundate.
W e l l , I can't see them being
inundated with offers, especially not
from us again.
