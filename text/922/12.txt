Felix Felix 922 17 January 1992
Stress came to as the pop up
bouncer grabbed him in a bear hug
and pulled him down underneath the
nightclub floor. The opening closed
above him and he was dropped on
to a conveyor belt in the pitch
darkness. Not yet recovered from
the flight, fright and head butt Stress
did not resist being carried along
through the dark as the club's
correcting system did its work.
'Drunken slob!'
Stress's feet signalled the approach
of a truly awesome noise.
Stress whimpered and began
pedalling like mad. T w o voices
boomed at his back.
" W E ' R E C O M I N G ! ' ' W E I R E
S T U N N I N G ! '
' Y O U ' R E R U N N I N G ! " ' W E ' R E
G U N N I N G ! '
Legs a blur he glanced around
and gasped. It wasn't very difficult
to recognise his earlier foe, ghetto
The Inner System
Chapter 10;
Perception. Troy
Tempest leads
us along the
nebulous fibrils
of surrealism.
A robotic hand whacked him in
the face.
'Animal!!'
A bucket o f water poured down
on his head.
'Dirty pig!'
A set of clubs pummelled his
body as he passed underneath.
' A l l right you!"
A blinding white light shone in
his face.
Don't you E V E R come in this
club again!!'
The voices and the light cut out,
the conveyor rolled him on to a
chute and he slid down and out into
a dark corridor behind the club.
Stress lay there, dazed. Thoughts
swam in his mind.
'I've got to get out o f this place.
This people are crazy! Riding
around on strange contraptions
under U V lights, their society
divided into meaningless classes.
Mortally afraid of minor skin
problems and different clothes! I've
got to find a ship and escape.'
He pulled himself up and
staggered d o w n the c o r r i d o r
towards the sounds of traffic. He
strode on to the main track and
keeping to the far wall, began
walking towards the head end of the
city.
'Untanned!! He's untanned and
walking!!'
People stopped in their tracks in
the tracks around. Many looked at
him in fear and revulsion, others
began to hurl abuse and close in on
him. Stress suddenly remembered
his own appearance, hidden up until
now by dim lighting. He backed up
against the wall. H i s pulse raced
and the military chemical factories
inside him began putting in some
more overtime.
'The pursuit cops are coming!'
The crowds' heads turned to the
source of the rising quadrophonic
sound. Their distraction gave Stress
the chance to run out into the track
and grab a B M X bike off a
surprised schmuck. In the distance
he could make out two tall figures
moving through the other motorists
at twice normal speed, strange
boxes attached to them. The
vibrating of the ground beneath
blasters shaking and phrases
b o o m i n g but with h i m was
something new. O n a motorised
skateboard trailing blue smoke was
a robot shorter but thicker with a
massive speaker on each shoulder
and a megaphone welded to its
mouth. They were speaking
alternate lines over the sound
crashing out o f the four amps.
' W E ' L L G E T Y O U Z I T S ! '
' A N D S C O R E S O M E H I T S ! '
' B L O W Y O U T O BITS!!' ' W I T H
A B E A T T H A T FITS!'
Pedalling like crazy Stress
couldn't make the bike go any
faster. Another bloody system
invention! Behind him a klaxon
voice spoke.
' * *In ititate anti-motorist
terrain**'
In response all the inner system
people moved off the track and
ahead o f Stress the normally flat
track turned into a garden of ramps,
holes, barricades and humps.
Yelping with fear Stress pedalled
straight on to the first ramp, up into
the air and over a barricade, down
to the g r o u n d , skidded and
carreered straight towards a skip
sized hole. Behind him ghetto
blaster leaped the same ramp while
megaphone, his voice somehow
short circuited into just percussive
sounds, rolled up and sloping wall
and bore down on the fugitive. The
beat closed in.
' W H I L E W E S T I L L R O L L ! '
' T S S H H T T A H T T S S H T T A H ! '
Y O U ' R E O U T A C O N T R O L ! '
' H M M B M M P A H S H B M M D M

H O L E ! ' K K R R H K R R R H D U M
D U M D U M M ! ' ' T H A T ' L L E A T
Y O U W H O L E ! '
Unable to disagree or change the
bikes course Stress rode straight
into the hole, somersaulted over the
bike and crashed into the far wall.
The robots rolled up on the flat
i track, finished their rough track,
stood before the prey they'd tracked
and shot him.
