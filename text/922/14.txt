Felix Felix 922 17 January 1992
Just when you thought it was safe
to go to a rag meeting a term
full o f madness, chaos and general
frolicking all around the country has
emerged. This term looks set to
follow the successes of last term and
maybe even exceed the amounts
collected so far. (Of course it's
going to exceed the amounts
collected so far - it's a mathematical
inevitability - Ed.)
So, what have we got lined up for
you? T o ensure that you have
absolutely no time free in between
the lectures and the bar nights, it all
starts on Sunday 26th January, with
a raid on all the halls around
college. We are hoping to storm the
halls and ensure that everyone has
a rag mag, a tee-shirt and a
generally lousy Sunday. See your
hall rep if you want to get involved
on that one.
Rag Update
Following that is the major rag
event for the term. Y o u ' v e had
Tiddlywinks, y o u ' v e had
Monopoly now Cluedo. Y o u r
chance to raid the whole of London
in an attempt to solve the crime,'
collect loadsa dosh for Winged
Fellowship and generally run riot.
There will be lots o f other rags
there, a huge party afterwards and
prizes for the team with the highest
points (details will be given on the
day on how to score). Watch this
space for further information on
how you could be part of the biggest
thing since the last big thing that
came along.
On Saturday 15th February, yes
the day after the Guilds Ball so most
of us will be hung over, there is the
'Back in Time' collection for
BIBIC (the British Institute for
Brain Injured Children), more
details to follow.
The next w e e k e n d , 22nd
February, there's a rag raid to
Bath. Generally a good place to
Penguin, acting
Rag Chair, with
a multitude of
ideas to ruin a
weekend.
collect as it's full of mindless
tourists who are foolish enough to
spend 'at least 50p' on a rag mag.
The weekend after that is the
Oxfam 'leap'. Suggestions include
taking part in the Firkin pub leap
or even 'Leap Draughts'. A n y more
ideas please bring them to the Rag
meeting on Friday lunch time.
On March 4th we have a City of
London licence to 'collect as we
know best'. This includes stations,
the stock-market, the underground
and anywhere else we can possibly
cause a fire hazard.
Some time later in March there
is the Mencap Parachute Jump. If
you are interested in taking part
please pop up to the rag office (ask
directions from the Union Office in
Beit Quad) and get a sponsorship
form and further details. Also, on
March 15th, the Fun Run for
Oxfam. A n annual event, held in
Birmingham, which loads of other
people will be taking part in. The
run is about three miles but is
generally done for fun rather than
competition. Sponsorship forms
available from the usual places!
Just a final note, anyone wishing
to vote in the forthcoming elections
for the post of Rag Chair should
attend the Extraordinary General
Meeting or E G M on February 6th
in the Junior J C R at one o'clock.
Remember the office is now open
every day at lunch time so i f you
have any questions, suggestions or
need some where to sit and chat feel
free to pop in.
Be young, be foolish and be part
of it!
Penguin
Marge blunders
on.
Dear Marge
Dear Marge,
I'm a budding young physicist
and I've fallen in love with my
relativity lecturer.
I try to ask really clever questions
but he just doesn't seem to notice
me.
I borrowed my sister's special,
non-drip, waterproof royal blue
mascara; but all in vain.
What next?
Yours Mr. P.H.I.
Dear Mr. P.H.I.,
There are four solutions to ensure
that no-one will ever find out about
your problem;
1. Kill him.
2. Kill yourself.
3. Kill everyone else in the
world.
4. Stop writing to Felix!
Yours Marge. The Wise Woman.
H m m m , well it seems as though I
caused a little friction in last weeks
issue. Apologies go to Melanie, I
know that you don't fancy Trigger
and I don't blame you either as he
snores in bed!
Did you know that Thames
Television seem to be migrating
into college staff? Steve Newbold
(marketing director), Valerie Straw
(estates). Keith Reynolds (head of
security) and Simon Westerman
(catering manager) are all part of
this weird breed of personnel. A
document leaked to Felix reveals
certain other facts regarding these
people. It seems that everything
going on in college is in some way
connected with Thames. This list
includes the fire alarm experts, new
card entry systems and the mess up
in relation to the sports facilities.
The document also reads:
'Call CM. The Destroyer. If you
have a flood, as in mechanical
engineering, the chances are that he
would have got rid o f experts who
could have prevented it. He is as
much use as an earache.'
If you ask me the person who
released this document is treading
on exceedingly thin ice and really
ought to watch his/her back just in
case someone concerned stabs back.
Another interesting fact is the
number of new personnel who
weren't included on this list. It
makes y o u wonder what the
intention o f the document was.
Just to end. a small note to the
two people caught bonking under
the snooker table on the third floor
on Saturday night. W e would just
like to say that you have no style,
if you're going to do it in the
snooker rooms why not on top of
the table. I won't mention any
names but we know who you are...
