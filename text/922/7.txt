Russian Scientist
On Friday January 24th Konstantin
Gringauz. a senior Russian Space
Scientist at the I K I (Institute o f
Space Research, Moscow), will be
visiting Imperial College. That
evening at 6.30pm in Elec E n g
room 408, he will be presenting a
talk which has been coordinated by
the Space and Atmospheric Physics
Department and I C U Students for
the Exploration and Development
of Space (SEDS).
Since Sputnik-1, which sparked
off the space age in the late 1950's,
the Soviet Union has been sending
probes to investigate the inner
planets and the interplanetary
environment. Throughout these 35
years of 'in-the-field' space science
research Konstantin Gringauz has
played a major role, from Sputnik
to missions to Mars, Venus and
Comet Halley.
Konstantin Gringauz's expertise
lies in plasma - charged particle-
detectors. Through his involvement
with instruments flown in Soviet
spacecraft he has made a number of
discoveries. He made some o f the
earliest measurements o f the solar
wind and hence discovered the
plasmapause boundary, which
marks the end o f the purely
terrestrial plasma regime in space.
Many o f his detectors flew on
vehicles in the Soviet planetary
p r o g r a m m e . T h r o u g h these
instruments he and his associates
discovered the cometpause at
Halley's Comet (the Vega mission)
and very large unexpected fluxes of
material drawn from Mars by the
Solar W i n d (the Phobos mission).
