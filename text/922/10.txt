Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey
Did you know that Bill & Ted's
Bogus Journey is yenruoJ sugoB
s'deT & IliB backwards? What's
more, did you know that this film
should really be called Good Bill &
Good Ted's (as opposed to Bad
Robot Double Bill and Bad....)
Bogus Journey?
Well, that's the plot out of the
way. N o w I can get on with
discussing the small print. O h ,
okay, this is how it runs: in a
completely gratuitous plot twist, the
producers decide to resuscitate Bill
n Ted for a new adventure. This
involves an incomprehensible
scheme from the future which for
some reason means that the princess
babes (if you haven't seen the first
movie, the chances are you won't
understand this one) are whisked
away into time and space. For a
further, and still more
incomprehensible reason, this
means Bill (n Ted) have to go to
Hell, Heaven and back in order to
save them. Don't worry, you won't
mind all this confusion during the
movie.
Anyway, the baddie then goes on
to send back some E v i l Robot
Doubles whose sole aim is to
confuse the issue still further. Yes,
even more. We're talking murky
motivations and unclear issues here.
E v e r y t h i n g pootles a l o n g
cheerfully, and in the most part
entertainingly as Ted (n Bill) dice
(and Twister) with Death, hob-nob
with the Easter Bunny and Einstein.
Oh, Joss Ackland plays Death. This
everyone in the Felix Office has
mentioned so far, so I guess it must
be important. O h , sorry, Joss
Ackland isn't Death, he's the
baddie. Hope that's clear.
Look, you'll enjoy it, okay ? It
stars Keanu Reeves (watch out for
him as a homeless rent boy in the
future. N o , I'm not kidding) and
Alex Winter (the other one. He was
one of the Lost Boys). They're too
old. But they're okay anyway. A n d
no, it's not as good as the first one.
That's what you wanted to know,
wasn't it ? A l l you ever bloody
want, isn't it ? Work my bloody
fingers to the bone, cuh ..
Oh yeah, the music is complete
shite.
The Most Excellent
Flying Gerbil
The Ghosts
The People Under the Stairs From Grand
Banks
The man who created Freddy (and
sold the rights, daft git) puts the
willies up you once again. A young
black boy from the ghetto is
convinced to aid his sister's
boyfriend in robbing their nasty
landlord's house to pay the rent and
get his mother 'that vital cancer
operation'. This is not as easy as it
seems, as the house is very well
protected with bars and locks. One
burglar gains entry and doesn't
come out, so the others go in. Once
in, they find a Rottweiler from hell,
and when the landlords come back
their situation is grave. The house
is tricky to get into and impossible
to get out of. If the fanged fido,
soundproof double glazing (Ted
Moult would be proud if he wasn't
dead) (to stop outsiders hearing the
shotgun wielded by the psycho
husband in his all-over leather
bondage suit and the odd booby
trap) isn't enough to contend with,
there are people under the stairs
who are so hungry they will eat
anything that comes within arms'
reach. In his wanderings, the boy,
known as ' F o o l ' , comes across the
mad couple's daughter, a prisoner
whom he must save. Faery tale
stuff, if not quite Brothers G r i m m .
The macabre ' T o m and Jerry' chase
that ensues is very compelling and
holds taut suspense.
The odd couple of wedded
landlords are played rather nicely
by Everett M c G i l l and Wendie
Robie (the couple Big E d and
Nadine from T w i n Peaks) with
plenty of humour and more than a
pinch of sadism. The story is
original and exciting even though it
degenerates to a fairly predictable
(but satisfactory) ending.
Great film, even if it is pure
exploitation. James Farrentino says,
'Forsooth, twas a gradely swath of
celluloid and did I make merry
aplenty'. He's spot on.
The Amazing Machine
Under the Bed
Arthus C Clarke's latest work. The
Ghost from the Grand Banks fits
right in with what we have come to
expect from one of the oldest
science fiction authors still writing.
The book is his contribution to the
myth of the Titanic. In this case, the
novel deals with attempts to salvage
the cruise ship in the early part of
the next century. As is inevitable in
fiction such endeavours do not go
smoothly. The plot, however, is not
important; rather it is an excuse for
Clarke to take us on a trip through
his dreams and beliefs about the
next millenium. The wild ride that
ensues covers all manner of subjects
from Mandlebrot sets to the habits
of deep-sea octopus. Along the way
the reader is kept entertained and
amused. If, at the end, you wonder
what the novel was all about, well
at least it served to pass a few hours
during term. Worth looking at.
