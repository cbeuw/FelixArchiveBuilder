Opinion Felix 922 17 January 1992
Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and
his shadow economic team have
announced their plans to pull Britain
out of recession, and to keep Britain
out o f recession.
The 'Made in Britain' package
builds on the earlier success of
Gordon Brown's 'Industry 2000'
campaign. T o develop plans for
technology and training, Shadow
Trade Secretary, Brown, published
a discussion document which was
the basis of a year long consultation
with industry.
build a strong economy is to make
the goods and services that people
at home and abroad want to buy.
This is how to secure jobs that
last, the way to create wealth to pay
for a first class National Health,
Service, higher living standards,
and a better quality of life.
What are the plans, and how will
they w o r k ? L a b o u r Shadow
Chancellor. John Smith, has the
answer.
'Britain needs a real recovery, a
recovery based on investment in
Made in Britain
Declan Curry,
IC Labour
Society Press
Officer, starts
the election
campaign. Oh
God, it's started
already.
As a direct result of this, Gordon
Brown announced at the 'Made in
Britain' launch last week that
Labour is making industrial policy
the central dividing line between
Labour and the Tories.
' A L a b o u r government is
prepared to work with industry to
address the training, technology,
investment and regional challenges
that face Britain', said M r . Brown.
Neil Kinnock told the conference
at the Queen E l i z a b e t h II
Conference Centre that Labour's
Made in Britain strategy 'combines
strong committment to economic
stability with positive policies to
build industrial strength'.
Common Sense.
The L a b o u r p o l i c y , to be
implemented on day one o f
government, starts from one simple
commonsense fact: the only way to
industry and in people, not another
candy floss consumption boom.
'Labour believes that the first
responsibility of government is to
create a stable economic framework
so that business can plan and invest
for the future.'
A Stable Economy.
Labour is to combine sustained and
balanced growth with stable
exchange rates, steady and
competitive interest rates, and low
inflation.
Labour will maintain the value of
sterling within the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism ( E R M ) .
Devaluation is not an option.
Sterling went into E R M at the value
it has averaged over the last twenty
years, and there it will stay.
Labour will tackle inflation head
on, and beat it. Inflation means too
much money chasing too few
goods. W e will solve both sides o f
the equation. Like our partners in
Europe, we will create a prudent
financial system, with sensible
credit management to prevent a
Credit e x p l o s i o n d r i v i n g up
inflation. L a b o u r w i l l end
Conservative policy of driving up
inflation through excessive price
rises for water, electricity, transport
fares, and prescriptions. Under
Labour, inflation will not be made
in Downing Street.
Investment.
Producing the goods is just as
important as controlling the money.
Investment is a crucial ingredient in
a successful counter-inflationary
policy. This is the real lesson c.
Germany and Japan, where high
levels of investment in industry and
in people have created economies
with the capacity to grow faster for
longer and with less inflation than
anywhere else.
As John Smith said at the 'Made
in Britain' launch:
'Recovery in Britain must be
investment led. W e must encourage
innovation and invest in new
technology, and in the skills of the
workforce.'
To bridge the investment gap
with our competitors, Labour are
proposing a new investment
incentive, an enhanced capital
allowance to enable industry to
expand its investment out o f
recession.
L a b o u r w i l l introduce a
M a n u f a c t u r i n g Investment
Expansion Scheme, offering a new
tax allowance for investment in
technology and equipment. There
will be an enhanced first year
capital allowance for certain
catagories o f plant and machinery,
and for investment in innovation
and design. Capital allowances will
be available for capital expenditure
involved in product development.
These enhanced allowances will run
for a fixed term to stimulate rapid
increase in investment at a time
when it is most urgently needed.
Labour will also offer new tax
incentives for individuals to invest
in new and growing manufacturing
firms. Investments will be set
against tax, and the scheme will run
for five years.
Science in Britain.
To bridge the technology gap,
Labour will implement a new
'Scientists in Britain' research and
development ( R & D ) incentive that
will offer the best incentives in
Europe and provide a direct
stimulus to high technology
companies to build strength into the
economy.
