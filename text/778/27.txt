La Bamba
A F I L M about music, love, success
and sorrow. It portrays the 8 month
rise to stardom of Ritchie Valens (Lou
Diamond Phillips), one of the three
rock and roll stars to tragically die in
the plane crash which killed Buddy
Holly and inspired Don McLean's
American Pie.
Unfortunately, unlike American Pie
the film does not live up to the
potential of the history behind it, nor
does it do real justice to the many rock
and roll stars whose music is reinacted
within it. The whole film seemed to
lack a feeling of realism which is
exceptionally sad as it is a true story.
Tacky production, unimaginative
camera shots and poorly picked props
(including a 1980s guitar in a 1950s
set) all let down what could have been
a very good story.
One performance of note is Esai
Morales (Bob Morales) who plays
Valen's rebel half-brofher. Inevitably,
Morales is involved in the more subtle
and striking parts of the film although
it must be said that his part did hold
a resemblance to a 1950s version of
Prince in Purple Rain. A l l this aside
it must be said that it was fun, I found
myself singing as I left and must
admit I shed a tear at the point when
Valen's death is heard over the radio.
It is worth seeing if only for the
beauty of the story.
As Don McLean said,
' 7 can't remember if I cried,
when I heard about his widowed bride,
but something touched me deep inside,
the day the music died. " /,//.
Full Metal Jacket
Stanley Kubrick's latest production
follows such classics as 2001: A
Space Odyssey and A Clockwork
Orange. It is another attempt to
expose the reality behind America's
self-conscious war in Vietnam. The
question still remains though: can any
single film successfully convey all
points of view? This is surely an
impossible task, yet Kubrick rises to
the challenge admirably.
Adapted from Gustav Hasford's
The Short Timers the film is neatly
split in two. Firstly we are taken
through rigorous basic training.
Despite repetitive drills and iron
discipline the various characters
develop, each coping in their own
way. Bullying and victimisation are
inevitable, with dramatic results.
Recruits, affectionately known as
'maggots', pray nightly to their rifles
as they are gradually turned into
'killing machines'.
In the second part we focus on the
fortunes of Private 'Joker' (Matthew
Modine) as a field reporter on the
Stars and Stripes, a morale boosting
rag for the grunts. Following the
battle for Hue city, the climax of the
1968 Tet offensive, Joker opts for
action in the front line over the
relative safety of the rear.
Kubrick's transformation of the
Docklands into a Vietnam war zone
in never wholly convincing, but here
lies the turning point of the film as
the characters are forced to accept
their hopeless position. A dramatic
encounter with a sniper brings home
the tragedy and cost of war in human
terms.
Ultimately a thoughtful and
intelligent production—the very
antithesis of Rambo—the film remains
a clinical, i f very worthwhile,
document. A.N.
The Big Easy
SET IN New Orleans, The Big Easy
is a familiar story of drug barons,
police corruption and gumbo. Based
on the tried and tested Tracy/Hepburn
style of romance, it tells the tale of
Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid),
homicide chief in the New Orleans
police department w h o is
investigating a gangland drug war.
Amidst the killings of rival gangs
Assistant District Attouniey A n n
Osborne (Ellen Barkin) arrives to
investigate police corruption.
Inevitably the two plots fall neatly if
somewhat predictably together.
At times the Big Easy (a colloquial
term for New Orleans itself) seems
more like a high budget pilot for a
television series a la Moonlighting,
but thankfully refrains from being
over sentimental. There are some nice
touches of humour notably M s
Osborne's introduction to McSwain's
younger brother.
The New Orleans setting with its
laid back lifestyle makes a refreshing
change from the usual N e w
York/California cop movies, and at
times the scenery is breathtaking..
Nothing new, but enjoyable all the
same. A.N.
