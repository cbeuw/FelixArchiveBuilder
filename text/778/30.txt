Fighting fit
Karate is an excellent choice for those
wishing to take up a martial art for
sport, keep-fit or self-defence. The
Imperial College Karate Club has
been running successfully for several
years and trains in the Shotokan style
which is based on speed and power.
The Club is afilliated to the Karate
Union of Great Britain and our
instructor is Caesar Andrews, a 3rd
Dan, who has in the past, coached
members of the British team and
regularly trains the Barbados national
team. In past years our club has
consistently obtained medals in the
Universities Championships and
Southern Area Competitions.
Lessons take place three times a
week ( M o n 7.30-9.00pm, W e d
4.00-5.30pm and Sat 10.00-12.00am)
in Southside G y m . With some
dedication it is possible to reach black
belt standard in the 3 years at College.
The first training session is free to
beginners, the only equipment needed
being some loose fitting clothing. N o
martial art is the best, but Karate
could be for you, so why not give it
a try. For more information come and
see us at Freshers' Fair where we will
be giving a demonstration on the
Queen's Lawn.
Blowing in
the wind
Attention a l l brass and w i n d
instrument players and percussionists!
If you enjoy playing as a hobby and
appreciate the chance to join a band
performing a variety of interesting
and often challenging music, then
Imperial College Concert Band is the
place for you.
The band rehearses every Monday
evening from 5.45pm until 7.15pm in
the Great Hall, Sherfield Building,
starting from Monday 12th October.
Concerts take place once a term with
occasional extra events. The summer
term concert is always the highlight
of the year when we traditionally play
T c h a i k o v s k y ' s 1812 Overture
accompanied by Dramsoc explosions
and the Queens Tower bells. This
event was even filmed by the B B C
this summer. W e set out to play at
least one major work in each concert
and we are fortunate in having an
excellent and very enthusiastic
conductor, D r Donald Monro, who
is quite capable of extracting the best
from the band in such pieces.
Players o f a l l standards are
welcome and i f more information is
required, look out for the stand at the
Freshers' Fair, otherwise please come
along on Monday 12th.
Science
fiction star
ICSF is especially lucky to have a talk
by the author Dave Brin as our first
event of this year. Dave Brin is one
of a select group of authors who have
come to prominence in S F over the
past few years, and many of his works
have won major awards. His novel
Startide Rising won both the Hugo
and Nebula . awards, and The
Postman, a post-World War UJ novel,
won the Locus and John W Campbell
Memorial awards. His other novels
include Sundiver, The Practice Effect,
The Uplift War and together with
Gregory Benford, The Heart of the
Comet. He has also written numerous
short stories...
Besides being a writer, Dave Brin
is a professional scientist, having a
P h D from U C S D i n Cometry and
Asteroid Studies. He presently works
as a consultant doing advanced studies
concerning the space shuttle and space
science. He frequently draws on his
real scientific knowledge in his books.
Since Dave Brin will shortly be
leaving the country, the talk has had
to be scheduled at a somewhat
unusual time—Wednesday 7 t h
October at 1.30pm in M E 220. W e
hope you will not miss this unique
opportunity to hear one of the
brightest stars of Hard SF.
Out and
about
With the Y H A Club you can get away
from it all, to such varied parts o f
Britain as the Peak District, Dartmoor
and Snowdonia.
We regularly organise weekend
trips, leaving Friday evenings and
returning in time for last tubes and
buses on Sunday night.
Weekends usually consist of hill
walking, with plenty of opportunities
for the keen photographer. W e are
active throughout the year. Some o f
the best trips can occur during
December and January: the North
Yorkshire Moors clad i n snow
provide some stunning views.
Last year's Easter trip was to the
Isle of Skye and the West Highlands
of Scotland. Other destinations
included the Brecon Beacons,
Shropshire Hills, Yorkshire Dales and
the Lake District.
Interested? Come along to our
Thursday lunchtime meetings and
find out more. (See events for
details.)
