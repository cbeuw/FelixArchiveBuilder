the loan
arrangers
Once upon a time
when things were what
they used to be,
banking was a
straightforward affair.
As a customer, it was
a matter of handing
over the cash and
letting the experts deal
with it. Nowadays,
however, audience
participation is called
for. First you select
the financial institution
(don't forget building
societies). Then you
are confronted by a
barrage of 'five star
current twenty-seven
month dual
chequebook accounts';
'student piggy bank
under sevens £5,000
overdraft' accounts
and the like while
juggling various pieces
of plastic, before you
meet on of a collection
of advisors who will
eventually consent to
deal with your money.
Unfortunately, it seems likely to get
more rather than less complicated.
Students are very good business for
banks: they have a tendancy to get
executive jobs with executive salaries
and may even need the odd loan on
the way. In order to get these student
accounts, the banks pull out all the
stops to appear friendly, legal, decent,
honest, truthful, etc, etc, as well as
showering the hapless individual with
enough free gifts to set up a small
retail business. In fact, the various
accounts on offer are fairly similar as
regards services: a cheque guarantee
card once your grant cheque has been
paid in, a cheque book and a cash
point card, statements, standing
orders and so on are all standard.
What's really worth
considering is how
much it's all going
to cost.
It's a sad fact that
about 5 0 % o f
students overdraw
at some time.
If you are likely
to do so, you will
probably want a
bank which offers
cheap overdrafts.
Most banks will
charge students a
low rate of interest
and waive bank
charges on pre-
arranged, limited
loans. Exceptions
to this are The Bank
of Scotland and
Allied Irish. Two
banks, Midland and
Clydesdale, will
even give interest-
free overdrafts of
up to £100 i f
arranged before-
hand.
W A R N I N G : if you don't arrange
your overdraft before going into the
red, or if you exceed your overdraft
limit, you will have to pay some
pretty steep charges.
Some banks/building societies give
interest when your account is in
credit. This could be worth quite a lot,
but check the overdraft policy before
committing yourself. T h e
Nationwide, for example, gives free
banking on an agreed overdraft, but
does have cheap interest rates for
overdrawn students. It could work out
more expensive than a normal account
with lower interest rates, depending
on the average state of your bank
balance.
Just about every current account
entides you to a cash point card. It's
very handy to be able to get cash
outside the amazingly inconvenient
bank opening hours. A l l the major
banks except Lloyds operate twenty-
four hour cashpoint service, but be
prepared for cashpoints which have
run out of money or generally don't
work.
As well as dispensing cash, the
machines have other facilities. You
should usually be able to find out your
balance as at the end of the previous
day, at least. The Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS) even provide a mini
statement with your last three
transactions, although you can't order
full statements there. You can also
make deposits at the cashpoints of
some banks (including the RBS).
Not only can you use your bank's
amazing cashpoint facilities, but if
you're a long way
from a branch
with a machine or
if the nearest one
is broken down,
you can use the
machine at an-
other bank. There
are three main
cashpoint groups,
as follows: Bank
of Scodand (BS),
Lloyds, Barclays
and Royal Bank
of Scotland;
Clydesdale, M i d -
land, NatWest,
Northern and
TSB are to join;
Nationwide, Co-
op and Girobank.
You can use a
card from a
particular bank at
any of the others
in the same
group, although
you may not be
able to use all the
normal services.
A word of warning about cheque
cards which also act as cashpoint
cards: it is less plastic to carry around
but if you lose your card or a machine
eats it, you might have trouble getting
hold of money.
