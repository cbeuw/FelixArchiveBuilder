Union
takeover
Reading University's Students' Union
is being threatened with a take-over
bid by University managers.
This drastic action is due to a 13
per cent cut in the Union budget over
the last two years and the lack of
financial reserves. Reading Union
may be the first of many students'
unions to have to close down or hand
over to College authorities when they
can no longer fund their activities.
FELIX Office
The Office is open between
9.30am and 6.00pm from Monday
to Friday for all Print Unit
enquiries, photocopying and
production work. Anyone
requiring to use the Office outside
of these hours should see Judith
Hackney. The Office closes all
day Sunday but it's usually open
other times for FELIX
production.
Montpelier
scrubbers
Whilst everyone else was bemoaning
the end of the holidays, Montpelier
Hall has been a hive of activity. The
Hall is situated near Harrods and was
bought by College 6 years ago.
However, except for a quickflitwith
a hoover the place hasn't been cleaned
properly since. There was however
a fat chance of getting the £4,000 to
clean it from College. So warden
Kevin O'Connor negotiated with.'
some residents so that they could have
a guaranteed place in Hall for
cleaning it. A team of 12 have been
busy this week working flat out
washing and cleaning. The reward for
most is their place but some other
volunteers are simply being taken out
for a meal. Mr O'Connor said that
Montpelier Hall residents have been
renowned for their good nature, this
year they converted a rubble-strewn
courtyard into a garden and provided
a large team for last year's Family
Day.
HELP AMNESTY!
Amnesty International will be holding its
National Door-to-Door Collection
between 4th and 11th October. The
Imperial College Amnesty Group intends
to do its duty in this regard in the halls
of residence and we need help!
Ate you interested in the work of
Amnesty International? Do you believe
in human rights? Have you got a free
evening this week? If yout answer to all
these questions is undoubtedly
affirmative then please seek us out at
the Freshers' Fair.
If you can't spare the time then try to
make a donation. Only the more gifted
students should have spent all of their
grant by this time.
Look out for Amnesty International at
Imperial this year-and get involved!
