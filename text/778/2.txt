Saving the best bit
until last...
Welcome to all of you reading F E L I X
for the first time and to those of you
who have seen a F E L I X before. I
hope you'll like the brand new format
and enjoy reading all the features
we've lined up for you this year.
Night of the Long Knives
It looks as though the Student
Accommodation Office is going
through another metamorphosis.
College administration finally realised
that the Accommodation Office was
still unable to cope with all that it had
been expected to. I fail to understand
the reasoning behind sending caring
ex-Student Accommodation Officer
Lesley Gillingham over to College's
Finance Section and allowing Michael
Arthur, who never seemed to give a
damn about students when he ran the
office before, take charge for the
busiest period of the year.
Rector
A n invitation was extended to the
Rector to write an official welcome
to, or back to, College in F E L I X . He
felt that this was not necessary and
declined the offer. This puzzles me,
as the Rector is continually
complaining about his lack of contact
with the rest of College and how he
wishes he could bridge the gap. Over
4,000 students and staff read F E L I X
each week. Surely F E L I X is the ideal
way to close that ever-widening gap.
Hamlet Gardens
Last week I joined IC Chief Engineer
David Evans, Brian Lloyd Davies and
I C U President Ian Howgate for a trip
to Hamlet Gardens. The purpose of
the visit was to show senior College
officials the state of some flats which
Fresher students would be moving
into this week. What confronted us
was rising damp, mouldy o l d
mattresses, dead mice, broken
furniture and curtainless rooms. The
visit obviously did the trick, because
both officials were suitably disgusted
and promised as much money and
manpower as was needed to repair the
Fresher flats. The flats which second
and third year students are to rent
have been given a lower priority as
these students apparently 'know what
to expect'.
The question which begs to be
answered is, why must the Union
draw such things to the attention of
top College officials? W h y was the
Student Accommodation Office
prepared to leave the flats in such a
s t a t e ?
News—or the lack of it
It has become harder and harder to
remain the newspaper of Imperial
College Union. With so few people
willing to talk to us, it's not surprising
that the F E L I X staff find it more
rewarding to write features rather
than news. This edition has been
incredibly frustrating. The main story
should have been based on the
College Finance & Executive (one of
the highest committees) held a few
weeks ago which discussed such
touchy subjects as departmental
autonomy and the fate of the money
raised from the sale of Harlington
gravel. F E L I X was not allowed to
observe at this meeting as all College
committees are closed. F o r some
reason, the Union Executive have
decided that they are not going to tell
F E L L X what went on in this meeting.
It seems that they have told every
other Union officer the tale but on the
understanding that the information is
kept secret. Every person I have
mentioned Harlington gravel to has
shied away, muttering that they swore
they wouldn't tell! It's the first time
that I have encountered anything like
this from the Union Executive. Every
Union member has a right to know
what any Union officer is doing on
our behalf. I hope to be raising this
question at Thursday's Union General
Meeting. Watch this space for more
information as the saga unfolds!
Touch not the Cat
F E L L X has a motto which has always
be«n held dear by its staff: Keep the
Cat Free. We put great importance on
our editorial freedom. Our place is to
criticise if criticism is due—whether
it be College administration or Union.
I heard today that our Union President
believes that he alone should have the
right to censor F E L I X . He has said
openly that he thinks that Union
Officers are there to do the work and
it is his place to make decisions. If
M r Howgate were to put his ego away
for one moment, he would realise that
it is not he that is The Union but every
student that is The Union. H e is
merely a representative. We are the
ones who make the decisions. I hope
that you will all attend the Union
General Meeting on Thursday and use
your vote to vote for editorial
freedom.
