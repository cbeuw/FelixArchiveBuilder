EEI 1
When you are old, crumbling and
solvent, your recollections o f
Freshers' Week will probably bring
a smile, a wince and a ghost of a
hangover, for this is the week of new
friends and tiddlywinks, first lectures
and all-night parties. It is bound to
present y o u with at least one
completely new experience, and
whether that experience is legal,
decent, honest and truthful or not is
your business.
More opportunities in this direction
happen on Sunday night, with the
RCS barnight in the Union, and the
R S M in Southside. This should put
you in a suitable mood for your first
sight of the Rector, on Monday in the
Great Hall, Sherfield Building at
10am for undergrads and 11.30am for
post-grads. If you can see more than
one of him, you really did overdo the
night before. Mixed with this on
Monday morning will be your first
stand up to face the music. This bit
is steeped in tradition and shaving
foam.
The pace hots up for the New Year
Party on Monday evening, which
starts at 8pm, and should lurch to an
exhaustive halt at around 2am. With
support bands, disco, main group
Voice of the Beehive, films, bar and
food this is not to be missed for any
reason—go for it, and good luck.
Tuesday morning—probably 'The
Morning After' to beat them a l l -
kicks off with more academic talks,
and a glimpse or two o f your
Wednesday begins—and your first
lecture! Wednesday afternoons are
always free for you sporty types to go
off to Harlington, and trials are held
there on the first Wednesday of the
year. The evening presents some
choice—Guilds are holding a Pie &
Mash do at Harlington, RCS and
R S M are drinking in the Union Bar,
RCS later venturing out for a crawl.
For the rest o f us, there's an
Alternative Comedy Night in the
Lounge, Union Building.
Thursday continues Wednesday's
trait o f offering some academic
activity, but has the added advantage
of an IC Union General Meeting at
1.00pm in the Great Hall. This is your
opportunity to quiz the Union Officers
on what they're doing with your
money. Instant democracy (why isn't
the Union privatised?—is the order of
the day—I think we should be told)
and you have great fun with points of
order and procedural motions. In the
evening Guilds and RCS go ice
skating together, meeting at the
Queen's Arms.
Friday is all work apart from the
HOW TO SPEND YOUR FIRST GRANT
CHEQUE IN JUST ONE WEEK
-the FELIX way
So you arrive, surrounded by
suitcases—necessary—and parents—
probably embarrassing—to take up
your place in hall or house. There are
selected residents in most College
accommodation whose job it is to
show you around, introduce you to
everyone else and take responsibility
for your first hangover of the week.
sight of your department, but we
won't dwell on that, or on the Union
spiel which follows it, except that
ICU Sabbaticals tend to give much
better value for money than the Rector
does.
More Union business is transacted
on Monday afternoon, when the
Constituent College Union Officers
department. Female Engineers can
wash this down with the Guilds
Ladies Lunch in Southside Bar's
Upper Lounge, after which you
should all be ready for Freshers' Fair,
a cross-College sprawl which is
designed to "introduce you to ICU and
C C U Clubs and Societies. Put your
name down for everything, but don't
part with any money—you can make
up your mind later.
After your feet have recovered
from wandering from stall to stall,
there are two evening events—the
R S M Ice Skating Trip, meeting in the
Union Bar (RCS and Guilds go ice
skating on Thursday) and the
Christmas Party. This is a disco-cum
bands and bar affair held in the JCR,
in the Sherfield Building
Freshers' Ball in the Union Building,
a fabulous event that it would be very
silly to miss, apart from the two main
bands (Rent Party and Cry Before
Dawn) there are comedians in the
Lounge (on previous occasions
including the inimitable Attilla the
Stockbroker) a jazz band, disco, bar
with extension till 2am plus
barbequed burgers and sausages.
Next morning is also
unforgettable—tiddlywinking down
Oxford Street to raise money for
charity. Don't try and avoid this as
you'll be woken up by shouting
parties anyway—meet at the C C U
offices at 9.00am to pick up your
licences, collecting cans, tiddles and
winks. Go with a friend, or grab a
passer-by at random. Afterwards
there's a Guild's Pub Crawl, meeting
at 5.30pm in Southside Bar. RCS and
Guilds have barnights in the Union
Bar o n Sunday and Monday
respectively.
Make friends, enjoy yourself; the
fun doesn't have to stop with
Freshers' Week. There are parties,
rag events and trips out all year, and
you can do as much or as little as you
like.
