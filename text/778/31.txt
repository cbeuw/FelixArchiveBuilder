AC battery shocker
Academics at Imperial College are yet
again at the forefront of a new
technology. Most of you will have
heard of Zinc-Carbon, Manganese-
Alkaline and Nickel Cadmium
batteries but soon they will be
superseeded in some applications by
Zirconium-Technetium cells. F E L I X
spoke exclusively to the head of the
project, Prof E Verreday of the Dept
of Physics.
Can you tell us about Zirconiumâ€”
Technetium cells?
Yes.
Please will you?
The different combinations o f
chemicals in a cell produces a
different form of energy release curve
like this:
Zirconium-Technetium cells behave
totally differently in that instead of
maintaining a constant voltage which
drops o f f , the voltage drops
immediately and continues through
zero to a negative voltage of the same
magnitude, it then reverses and flows
back to + V C . This oscillation
continues with a fractional energy loss
each time so that the energy release
graph looks like this:
In other words, you have invented
a.c. batteries?
Yes. Although strictly speaking they
are alternating voltage cells (AVC's).
What frequency do AVC's oscillate
at?
normal modes of oscillation but we
are working on producing different
frequencies by altering the relative
amounts of each constituent and-
trying small quantities of other
substances to see what effect they
have.
What voltages do the cells have?
They have been made in all popular
sizes; HP7, HP2, HP11, etc.
In what applications will AVC's be
used?
The main use we see for them is that
they will allow ac motors to be used
in much smaller applications than is
currently available. Your readers will
probably notice them first in things
like personal stereos and cassette
decks. There are literally thousands
of applications for the AVC.
Are any companies funding your
research?
We are currently negotiating with
many people about financial
assistance to continue the project.
When are we likely to see AVC's in
the shops?
We anticipate commercial production
by 1991.
And they will presumably make you
a very rich person?
At the moment we only have two Hopefully.
Whereas Manganese-Alkaline and
Nickel-Cadmium cells produce a
much sharper cut off of voltage like
this:
I should like to take this opportunity
to reiterate my tedious opinions about
anonymous letters in F E L I X . I may
be completely out of touch with the
students at this College, and I may
have no idea what complete bastards
some senior tutors are, but there is
absolutely no excuse for the sort of
letter you carried in your Easter
edition. If any students have problems
with their course they should follow
the normal channels for making
complaints. Firstly, they should
contact their academic year rep or
Departmental Representative.
Normally both of these people can be
relied upon to forget about such
matters, and clearly this is the
simplest and most efficient way to sort
out any difficulties. On the off chance
that the matter is raised at the
departmental staff-student committee
we can normally rely on the Director
of Undergraduate Studies to dismiss
the plaintiff with patronising remarks
about lack of committment from their
students. In the very unlikely event
that some self-important Academic
Affairs Officer brings the matter to
the College's Board of Studies,
Imperial employs a College Tutor
who will always display a great deal
of sympathy for the Students' course,
and will recommend that a sub-
committee be set up to look into the
issue. Hence there are three levels of
representation which may be used to
diffuse any academic problems. If any
student is dissatisfied, my wife and
I are fully prepared to meet them for
an informal discussion over dinner.
There is and cannot be any
justification for any spineless jerk to
write anonymously to F E L I X . W e
must all be careful to protect the
inflated reputation of Imperial College
in case the U G C discovers what a
shitty life most students lead.
I hope that you will pay more
attention than your predecessor to this
matter.
Yours
32 Monday October 5th 1987 FELIX
