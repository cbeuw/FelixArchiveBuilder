New school
opens for
business
The new Imperial College School of
Management (ICSM) opened for the
first time this summer under the
directorship of Professor Norburn.
The School is a result of the merger
between the Social and Economic
Studies and Management Science
departments.
Professor Norburn intends to make
I C S M one of the top business schools
in Europe and aims to teach over 400
students how to manage technology
effectively.
At the moment all the courses are
postgraduate but it is planned to
introduce innovative teaching to 300
postgraduates and around 150
undergraduates by 1990.
Professor Norburn is very keen to
take technology-sponsored students
and proposes that a large degree of
funding for the new school comes
from industry. He also wishes to set
up three research centres jointly with
industry and will even have tailor-
made courses for the school's
sponsoring company.
Lexham
money and
mail stolen
A large amount of money was stolen
from electricity meters in Lexham
Gardens flats this summer and several
people have complained that mail has
been stolen. The trouble is believed
to have been connected with a group
of illegal residents in House 54. A
student, who had paid for her flat
throughout the summer, let it to a
group of men she had met casually.
They wrecked the flat and refused to
go when Lexham Student Manager
Aaron Kotcheff asked them to leave.
It was around this time that money
and mail were stolen and another flat
in the same house was burgled.
Amongst the mail stolen was M r
Kotcheff s new cheque book and bank
statement, with which the robber
withdrew his entire bank balance. The
matter is currently in the police's
hands.
The illegal residents finally left
after M r Kotcheff switched off their
electricity.
College insurance mix-up
The Student Union Office is still
dealing with claims on the Halls
Insurance Policy. The Policy covers
the belongings of all students in
College Residences and Head
Tenancies, and has been administered
by the Union Honorary Secretary in
the last few years.
On average there are about a dozen
claims every month but last year there
were difficulties with claims on the
Policy. Paperwork was held up in
College Finance Section and some
claims are 11 months late. Student
Residence Committee (SRC) recently
has agreed 'in principle' that the
administration of the scheme should
be moved away from the Union, but
did not decide who should take over
the responsibility.
Lesley Gillingham (then Student
Accommodation Officer) agreed that
her office should take it over but
Managing Surveyor Residences Peter
Hallworth later said she had had no
authority to make such an agreement.
In view o f the recent ' r e -
organisation' i n the Student
Accommodation Office, current IC
Union H o n Sec Chas Jackson is
continuing to do the job. He told
F E L I X : " I f it wasn't my students
putting claims in, I would dump it on
someone else's desk right now", and
said that he was "not at all happy".
He hopes that once the Student
Accommodation Office situation
settles down they will still be able to
take insurance over.
Anyone who wishes to claim on the
Policy should, for the moment,
contact Chas Jackson in the Union
Office (ext 3503).
Data
protection
Imperial College has been issued with
guidelines on the use of computerised
information outlining the
requirements of the Data Protection
Act. The guide is mainly concerned
with access to examination results. It
says that candidates should be allowed
"the maximum reasonable" access to
assessment and examination marks".
It stresses the need to tighten security
over the information stored,
especially of a personal nature.
Business
innovation
The Student Industrial Society has
recently launched its annual
"Innovation for Business A w a r d " .
The organisers are looking for fresh
ideas which are both creative,
practicable and have the people
behind them to develop the ideas to
their full potential.
Anyone who would like further
details should contact IC Industrial
Society's Chairman Gary Monoghan,
Maths III.

Geoff Parsons, this year's President of RSMU, was part of the British
team sent to the World Athletics Championships in Rome this summer.
He achieved tenth place with a jump of 2.25m, behind P Sjoeberg of
Sweden (2.38m), two men from the USSR, I Paklin and G Avdeako (2.38m)
and P Moegeburg of West Germany (2.35m).
From Rags to
riches
Again this year there will be no Rag
Mag to start the new year. Although
Rag Mag Editor Gehan De Silva had
most of the material in time, the
censorship put a stop to it. The Board,
consisting of the Rag Committee and
the Exec, decided that the material
was 'unsuitable' with most of it being
too sick or so clean it was unfunny.
A further problem was encountered
when M r De Silva had to leave the
country as part of his course. This left
the Rag Mag without an Editor, the
problem was overcome by forming an
Editorial Committee with I C U
President, Ian Howgate, at the helm.
The situation was then exacerbated
when the Rag Chairman, Nigel
Baker, disappeared with most of the
revised material.
However, M r Howgate told F E L I X
that the Exec, and anyone else they
found in the Bar, had been working
hard collecting new material which
they were very happy with. They
already had nearly enough for a
complete Mag which included many
original ideas for the layout and
general concept of the Mag, such as
foreign language jokes. Nevertheless
they would still be grateful for any
further contributions.
M r Howgate did promise that the
Rag M a g would be ready for Rag
Week in mid-November and that it
would be a jolly good Rag M a g .
