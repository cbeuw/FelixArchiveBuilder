Two pints of
lager and a
packet of crisps...
"Food, glorious
food." How many of
you can't sympathise
with this sentiment?
But a look at our
diets reveals them to
be anything but
glorious. Among the
maze of 'discoveries'
and theories about
what we should be
eating, a few facts
stand out as (almost)
certain. Most of
us—that is, in the
western society—are
eating too much fat,
too little fibre, and
too many calories.
Other, more doubtful
suggestions—that
most diets contain
too much salt, too
few vitamins, too
much meat...
Unfortunately, the right answers are
simply not all known: experts and
commentators are still at the stage of
interpreting—each in their own way,
of course—interim results from newly
started research.
Eating patterns have changed over
the years.- Rather than three 'proper'
meals a day, people eat when they feel
like it, often far more than three times
a day. As many snack foods are very
high in fat, sugar and salt, but poor
in vitamins, this may be a reason why
heart disease kills 180,000 people a
year in Britain; or why by middle age
50% of men and 33 % of women are
too fat. More bad news; some forms
of cancer are becoming more
common. This may be diet related;
but diet must also play some part in
the fact that more people than ever
before are living to the age of 80 and
over.
So don't panic and start one of the
many fad diets. Each of the vital
ingredients in any diet can do harm
whether eaten to excess or in too
small quantities. There's nothing
wrong with individual foods, either;
their effect will depend on how you
combine them to form your total diet.
And the big question is: how do you
eat healthily on a student-sized bank
account?
'Fibre' seems to be the word of the
moment. Found only in plants, it is
credited with reducing risks of
diverticulitis and colon cancer;
possibly of heart disease; hiatus
hernia and constipation. But watch
it—too much reduces absorption of
some nutrients and may cause
diarrhoea. Your average intake
should be about 30g per day (see table
for nutritional value of several
common foods). If you think your diet
lacks fibre, increase the amount
slowly—over 2 to 3 weeks. Bran in
breakfast foods (read the packet), and
wholemeal bread are good sources.
Fruit and vegetables also help, these
can generally be bought cheaply,
especially in the markets. Brown
pasta and brown flour in cooking may
also be useful.
Fat, of course, is the main villain
in our diets. It is an important
substance as the main energy source
and a component of every cell in the
body, besides helping i n the
absorption of important fat-soluble
vitamins (eg vitamins A , D, E and K).
But it is beneficial only in the right
quantities. One can suffer ill effects
from too little fat, but you'd have to
try very hard to achieve this. No one
over the age of five should get more
than 35% of their energy from fat; for
women this usually means 60 to 85g
per day, for men 70 to 1 lOg per day,
depending on energy intake. Basic
steps to reduce your fat intake start
with eliminating as much 'visible fat'
as possible—no meat fat, no chicken
skin, less butter or margarine. Then
go on to cut down on 'invisible fat'.
This means grilling (or other fatless
cooking techniques) instead of frying
food. Switching to semi-skimmed or
skimmed milk will help still more.
Cholesterol is a problem associated
with fat in a diet, so keep an eye on
what type of fats you're eating-
animal fats have generally high
cholesterol values, egg yolks are
particularly notorious. (Cholesterol,
as everyone knows, can build up in
the arteries, leading to heart disease.)
Carbohydrates are mainly
represented in food by sugars and
starch, both of which, like fat, are
converted to body fat if eaten in
excess. Unless you have a weight
problem (too much or too little)
you're probably getting enough. Note
that some people divide this class of
food into 'valuable' and 'empty'
carbohydrates. The former deliver,
besides the carbohydrate, some
vitamins, minerals or fibre, and
include such foods as whole grain
products, fresh and dried fruits,
potatoes and other vegetables. The
'empty' carbohydrates comprise,
naturally, many of the snack foods—
chocolates, sweets, jams and other
confections including white bread.
Protein—vital for the growth of
cells and muscles—is another material
of which an excess is converted into
body fat. Most people are probably
getting plenty. Vegetarians, if they
include milk and cheese in their diet,
probably also get enough protein.
Vegans, on the other hand, have to
take special care. Important to their
diet are pulses (beans, lentils), grains,
nuts and potatoes. Meat eaters, for
various reasons, are advised to
consume more fish and less red meat.
Salt, vitamins and minerals are also
an important part of the diet. A total
lack, or more likely, low levels of any
one of a dozen vitamins or minerals
can lead to constant tiredness and lack
of enthusiasm for life, at the least.
More severe shortages cause such
deficiency diseases as scurvy or
goitre. But any moderately sensible
diet is likely to contain a reasonable
amount of each vitamin so if you feel
under-dosed don't head for the
vitamin tablets; readjust your diet.
Take the 'recommended daily
allowances' (RDAs) with a pinch of
salt (not literally, please...high salt
intake helps raise blood-pressure).
Nine years ago they were set too high,
to ensure that no-one suffered
deficiency diseases,and if you know
whether they've been lowered since,
you should be writing this article.
Speaking o f recommended
allowances, the average energy intake
recommended by the DHSS has been
found to be too high as people are
now less active in general than was
thought when the figures were set.
Women need about 1750 kcal; men
about 2000 kcal per day. It is possible
to keep to a balanced diet within these
limits whatever your eating patterns,
though it is harder when you're eating
lots of small snacks. Just remember
that your diet stands the best chance
of being healthy if you eat a variety
of foods, ranging from bread, rice and
pasta (preferably wholemeal/whole
grain), oatmeal and high fibre
breakfast cereals, and pulses, to lean
meat, (skinless) poultry, fish, eggs,
lots of different vegetables including
potatoes, fruit, and skimmed milk.
For more extensive, expert, and
possibly controversial, advice on
healthy eating, consult any of the
numerous diet books. McDonalds
(remember hamburgers?) even
produce their own 'Nutrition Guide'.
Very sensible stuff, but watch the way
they carefully avoid the word 'fibre'.
Bon appetit.
