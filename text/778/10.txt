Hello everyone, welcome or welcome
back to IC. I am not going to write
anything about IC and the first weeks
here, as the freshers among you will
have handbooks and the rest of you
will know it all anyhow. I'd just like
to remind you about the tiddlywinks
down Oxford Street on Saturday,
where we all have our first chance of
the year to raise money for charity.
At the same time don't forget
Freshers' Fair on Tuesday, cos
getting involved in clubs after that
point can be quite hard, but don't let
that deter you.
Now we've got the drivel out of the
way, here's a quick update on the
summer.
Residences
When you left last year, I C U had
decided not to recognise the Student
Residence Committee (SRC) as a
valid decision-making body. Well,
over the summer, the S R C had
decided to and is in the process of
reassessing its terms of reference, the
structure of the committee and the
management structure i n the
residences. It would appear at present
that the Union will do well out of the
reorganisation although these are
early days yet.
At the end of the year it was
reported that College rents will rise
by £7 per week over the next three
years. This is a direct result of
College purchasing an extra 200
places. It is interesting to note that the
revised College plan indicates that
there will be an increase in student
places with College-owned
accommodation of 250 places per
year for the next four years, yet there
is no indication of where the money
is going to come from to pay for this.
Surely they cannot expect it come out
of rents? Still on accommodation, the
Union has held the first meeting of the
Union Accommodation Committee in
12 years which strangely had no
matters arising from the previous
minutes. We will be looking for one
student representative from each hall
or house to sit on this committee and
look at the general problems of
housing as well as independent
problems in Imperial accommodation.
So if you live in IC accommodation
and are keen to look after the well-
being of your friends as well as
getting involved in hall or house
activities speak to your warden or
subwarden as soon as possible.
Intercollegiate Halls
Some quite interesting information
about intercollegiate halls has come
to light over the summer, but we will
discuss this at the U G M , so you'd
better be there.
The Junior Common Room
The J C R problem has not yet been
resolved but rumour has it that we are
likely to be given a new J C R
somewhere else in College, probably
in the basement of Mines. Having
been down and looked around this
basement I could not see any suitable
area. Perhaps I just have a very poor
imagination?
Damages
Having talked about residences and
the JCR, I would like to point out that
the College has spent quite a lot of
money and effort on bringing these
areas up to standard with a few
exceptions in residences. Last year
Linstead Hall was brought up to
scratch and it was so badly treated that
it had to be repainted this year. Within
a week of the J C R refurbishment
someone was found stubbing a
cigarette out on the wall to see if it
melted. These areas are put there for
your good, treat them well and if you
see anyone abusing them tell them not
to, after all it will come out of your
pockets in the end either as increased
rents or increased food prices.
College is not rich, in fact it is very
poor and they cannot afford to pay for
these things every year. A s far as halls
are concerned, I will be pushing
communal area damage and that
means repainting, to be costed at the
end of the year and taken out of
everyones' deposits. I'm sorry about
those of you who treat the place well,
but i f it doesn't come out of your
pockets it will only have to come from
your successor's and they are
definitely innocent.
Public Relations
College has made one of the most
positive and forward- looking moves
in years by appointing a public
relations officer (Ian Moore). At the
last College Finance and Executive
Committees his budget for the next 5
years was approved. This included an
input of £169,000 next year, this is
expected to be recovered by 1989
with a net profit of over £320,000 by
1990. In this I wish Ian Moore the
greatest success.
Last Point
As a last point I'd like to say farewell
to Stagefright who are turning
professional and leaving IC. I wish
them all the best with this and must
say they show more promise than any
band I've seen before. At the same
time I would like to thank Jason, Nass
and especially Peter for running the
Snack Bar so well over the summer
as they are leaving us.
Yours, Ian
PS. Remember to enjoy the
entertainments lined up for the
coming week.

Women only
During Freshers' Week most events
go on until the early hours of the
morning which leaves many women
students with the choice of whether
to miss the parties or to brave London
at night.
With the high rents around
Kensington, many students are forced
to live out in Wandsworth, Putney or
North London. It is a sad fact that
many women have very little choice
when faced with problems such as no
transport or the likelihood of getting
stuck late at night alone. Most women
know better than to walk London's
streets alone at night unless absolutely
necessary.
This may all seem a little dramatic,
especially if you come from a quiet
neighbourhood, but attacks are
reported daily so there is certainly
something for women to be scared
about.
The police advise young women not
to wear expensive jewellery or
fashionable clothes because that
would just be asking for trouble so
don't be surprised if there are a large
number of nuns at the Freshers'
events!
Luckily the Union have decided to
provide a minibus service after the
New Year's Party and Freshers' Ball
to take women students home, this
will come as a great relief to those
who would have stayed at home
otherwise.
The minibuses will be leaving from
Beit Arch from 2.00am on Tuesday
and Saturday mornings to coincide
with the shutting of the Union Bar.
This service is for women students
only.
