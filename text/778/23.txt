the FELIX places-to-eat guide
Cheap! Cheap!
Over recent years
there has been an
explosion in the
number of places
you can eat out.
This explosion has
created problems
for the average
Imperial student
who wants
something good
and cheap but
doesn't know
where to start. If
you know the
right places you
can get an
excellent meal for
under a fiver but,
if you don't, you
may get badly
cooked, factory-
made rubbish.
There are over twelve thousand places to eat in London
alone but we have only chosen 21 to recommend due to
their proximity or ease of reach. Throughout the year we
will have numerous restaurant reviews as we discover
many more of the better places to eat.
A l l places include opening times and the nearest tube
station. A l l price categories are for a minimum of two
courses without wine.
UNDER £3.00
Ghana Students' Hostel
3 Collingham Gardens, SW5
7 days, 12.30-6.30pm
Tube: Earl's Court
This place doesn't advertise that it's a restaurant so you'll
have to follow your nose down to the basement. They only
cook three hot dishes each day and they're all Gnanian
but the service is good and the helpings are generous.
Lorelei
21 Bateman Street, Wl
Mon-Sat, Noon-llpm
Tube: Tottenham Court Road
This little Italian restaurant tends to be a touch
claustrophobic but they offer many types of pizzas and
pastas at around £2.00. Good food and an enjoyable
atmosphere.
Peters
59 Pimlico Road, SW1
Mon-Sat, 7am-10pm,
Sunday, 8am-4pm
Tube: Sloane Square
Large portions of traditional English food along with the
occasional European surprise such as mussels for just over
a pound or pasta topped with home-made sauces.
The 'Pots' Chain
Stockpot, 6 Basil Street, SW1
Chelsea Pot, 356 Kings Road, SW3
Others: Hot Pot, New Hot Pot
and The Pot
The Stockpot's menu changes every day so its possible
to eat there all the time without having the same dish twice.
It's small but friendly and everything is home-made. It
serves both English and International food and most meals
include chips and vegetables. It opens between 8am and
10.30pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 9.30pm on
Saturdays. It's sister restaurant, the Chelsea Pot, is open
7 days a week from noon until 11.30pm. Most main
courses are under £2.00, with puddings well under £1.00.
Beware though of the many arty people who tend to
frequent the place in the evening!
New Piccadilly
8 Denman Street, Wl
7 days, 11.30am-9.45pm
Tube: Piccadilly Circus
If you want to combine your Italian food with a bit of
entertainment, then this is the place. Best food has to be
the steaks, omelettes or salads. Watch out for the soup,
though, as it's definitely straight out of a tin.
Nut House
26 Kingly Street, Wl
Mon-Friday, 10.30am-7pm;
Sat, 10.30am-4pm
Tube: Oxford Circus
A wholefood restaurant which serves only vegetarian
meals. Their eggs are free range and they do a mean nut
rissole for just over a pound.
La Perla
28 Brewer Street, Wl
Mon-Sat, 11.45am-10.30pm
Tube: Piccadilly Circus
This restaurant serves a mix of British and Italian Dishes.
The food is good and service excellent. It's a wonderful
place to eat if you don't mind the decor but do like being
fussed over.
Food for Thought
31 Neal Street, WC2
Mon-Fri, Noon-8pm
Tube: Covent Garden
This is a very popular vegetarian restaurant in Covent
Garden due to the quality and price of the food it serves.
At lunchtimes you must be prepared to queue and eat pretty
quickly once you've been seated.
Cosmoba
9 Cosmo Place, WC1
Mon-Sat, 11.30am-llpm
Tube: Russell Square
This Italian restaurant come highly recommended by the
residents of the inter-collegiate halls. It serves the usual
pastas and the menu is vast. The only fault is that the sauces
sometimes tend to be gluey if you come on a bad day.
Shan Restaurant
200 Shaftesbury Avenue, WC2
Mon-Sat, Noon-lOpm
Tube: Tottenham Court Road
Another Indian vegetarian restaurant which caters mosdy
