oAll of the IC clubs will be at the
Fair, and this is your opportunity to
see what they have to offer.
The Fair is split between the Union
Building (Beit), the Sherfield
Refectory and the Queen's Lawn.
Make sure you don't part with any
money - Clubs can only take your
name and department so they can
contact you later.
