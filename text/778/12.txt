There is a certain monotony in
looking back through past years'
freshers' FELIX's. Contained within
a sponge of "welcome to freshers"
all you can find are the odd currents
of "Publications Banned" and "New
Building Opened" flavoured sultanas,
precious little else.

Debt: the
millstone
around our
necks
Most students will go overdrawn at
one time or another. With the ever-
reducing grant, debt has become a
fact of life. A few of you may find
yourselves going deeper and deeper
into debt with easy-to-use credit
cards and easy-to-sign credit
agreements.
It's a good idea to take some time
before deciding on signing any
agreement. Don't sign unless you
understand everything i n the
agreement and you're sure you are
doing the right thing. Every
cancellable agreement must include a
box entitled 'your right to cancel' on
the form you sign, which will tell you
the procedure. Don't forget that you
must get a copy of the agreement—
you are entitled to this.
You can end a hire purchase
agreement when you have paid back
at least half the total amount payable
and you return the goods, as long as

you are up to date with the
instalments. On the other hand, if you
want to settle the account early, you
can do so at any time. The goods will
be yours and you should also be
entitled for a rebate.
Another way of regulating your
cash flow is a credit card. These
usually either require you to settle
your account each month or to pay off
a set minimum account at the end of
the month, interest being charged on
the balance remaining. Either way
you have the advantage of a month's
free credit. However, some people
refuse to have a credit card on the
grounds that it's too easy to get deep
into debt. You have to be sensible if
you leave a lot of money unpaid it is
a very expensive way of borrowing—
if you're charged 2% interest per
month, for example, you will be
paying 26.8% in a year. That's about
twice the overdraft interest rates!
Credit cards have other advantages
like foreign use and acceptance in
other countries.
There are still more ways of getting
credit, which can be useful i f you
want to make a 'major investment' for
example. Always shop around for the
best interest rates (usually known as
the Annual Percentage Rate—APR).
It's a mistake to over-commit yourself
and don't forget to check every bit
of small print, because once you sign
a credit agreement it is legally
A number of student publications
are produced over the summer,
particularly the Rag Mag, and the
Union Handbook. Recently there has
been much discussion, once the
students have returned after the
vacation, as to the rights and wrongs
binding—you'll be liable whether you
read it or not. Only use reputable,
long-established companies and don't
take any salesperson's/advisor's word
for granted. Check it out yourself:
Also keep a copy of the agreement
and any other papers, in a safe place.
If you are offered free credit, also
check that the individual payments
don't add up to more than the single
payment price.
You don't have to live very
extravagantly to get into debt.
Unexpected or just under-estimated
expenses can make all the difference
between having things under control
and an ever-increasing overdraft. The
most important thing to do is to act
immediately.
A good way to start is by listing all
your outgoings and income. Calculate
your disposable income (the amount
left after really essential expenses)
then work out the hightest debt
priorities. It's most important to keep
a roof over your head. Then sort out
fuel bills and hire purchase debts, as
you could be cut off or have your
goods repossessed.
Tell your personal tutor if you are
having serious money problems and
have a chat with the Welfare Advisor,
Linda Simmons.
Try to cut down on non-essentials.
You may be able to sell something to
bring in some extra money, but never
sell anything for which you still owe
of the censorship imposed by the
sabbaticals. Two years ago the Rag
Mag was banned by the sabbaticals,
a ban which was then lifted by a
U G M , but this isn't a recent
phenomena, in 1967 the Rag Mag was
banned; F E L I X reported brisk sales
'under the counter' in an attempt to
recoup the losses.
Even the welcome stays the same.
1961 President 'Seaforth Lyle'
warned, on the front page of F E L I X ,
that "the dislike of apathy is not just
a whim of the senior students". The
major change seems to be that in those
days there were was not "Freshers"
but "Freshmen".
The tasty bits of icing include the
agenda for freshers U G M in 1981,
which contained a motion proclaiming
the Chairman a baffoon, and
instructing him to wear a "clowns "red
nose" at all meetings and in 1968,
when the then RCS Vice President
was arrested on a Peace March after
allegedly throwing a stone at the
police. His alibi was that he was
walking away, composing poetry at
the time.

significant item to appear in a
Freshers' F E L K must be a news item
from 1965, announcing "Natural Gas
had been found in the North Sea".
money. See if you can end any hire
purchase agreements you have.
Now you should deal with your
other creditors. Be honest with them.
Go and see your bank manager and
see i f you can arrange an extended
overdraft, if necessary. Never take out
an extra loan to pay off all your debts
at once, such as those advertised in
newspapers. Even if you can get the
loan, you will almost certainly end up
deeper in debt as the terms are less
than generous.
Sending your creditors a financial
statement would show that you are
being realistic. You could offer to pay
back a smaller amount regularly—but
don't offer more than you will be able
to afford. Keep a copy of all the letters
you send as well as keeping any you
receive.
If you are being harrassed by your
creditors, contact the Welfare
Advisor. Creditors are allowed to
remind you of your debt occasionally
but they may not phone late at night,
call every five minutes, station
conspicuous 'Debt Collection' vans
near your home and so on.
It's most unlikely you will have any
major problems with money, but i f
you do there are always plenty of
people who are in a good position to
advise you. If you keep an eye on
your finances you will be able to spot
any worrying trends and put a stop to
them!
