John Noble, this year's Entertainments Chairman, takes a quick look
at this month's
Essential Entertainment
Before we get started could I again
remind all of you who ordered tickets
for Freshers' Week by post not to
forget to pick them up. There should
be an Ents stall in the SCR for most
of Monday morning and afternoon,
where you can buy or collect tickets.
So what's happening then; on
Monday, ie October 5th, we have the
New Year's Party headlined by The
Voice of the Beehive an entertaining
off shoot of mega group Madness,
about whom the critics swoon with
delight. On the same bill you can see
the Blue Aeroplanes 'a crazy mix of
freakish surrealism and jangly saw-
toothed guitar...I hearby nominate
them as the best thing I've heard in
The big party is on Friday October
9th at the Freshers' Ball featuring
Rent Party the best party band in the
world as I know it, supported by
Salvation Sunday who are at present
cruising the air waves with their
excellent single Come To Your
Senses. Then to top this off we have
a mix of rock, jazz, comedy, discos,
late bars, food and films to take you
into Saturday morning.
Having told you what's on I
suppose I should tell you where to go
and how much it will cost. Mon and
Fri start at 8.00pm tickets on the door
are £4.50, Wed starts at 8.30pm
tickets on door £2. You can of course
buy weekly tickets on Monday for £9,
ages'—MM, last but not least we have
the Brilliant Corners 'their songs are
set in a feeling of dizzy exhilaration
of life; really they could be called
'Delirious"—MM. M i x the above
with discos, late bar, food and films,
you've got a jolly good night's
entertainment.
On Wednesday you can see some
of the best in alternative cabaret with
Steve Rawlings, a wonderful juggler
and pyromaniac, Phil Cornwell a
stand up impressionist who's David
Bowie has to be seen to be believed
and Gary Howard who is best
described as special. The compere is
Philip Arnold who isn't yet famous,
but he assures me he will be very
soon.
these cover all 3 events.
So that's Freshers' Week out of the
way what of the rest of term. O n
Friday October 16th you can see
Circus Circus Circus in the Lounge
and on Thurs October 22nd Jim
Jiminee will be in the same amazing
venue, both at ridiculously low prices.
More on this next time. The rest of
term should be a mix of bands, discos
and cabaret, but what happens largely
depends on whether or not you turn
up which of course you will.
Don't forget if you want to get
involved with Ents come to the stall
at Freshers' Fair and sign up we'd
love to see you.
John Noble
Ents Chairman
