S U M M E R Letting Scheme (SLS)
guests caused serious damage to head
tenancy flats in Hamlet Gardens this
Summer. A s well as disturbing
nearby residents and throwing litter
out of the windows, some of the
guests had assulted the S L S
Managers, damaged parked cars in
the area and one group had sold
furniture from their flat.
Hamlet Warden Geoff Hungerford
said that SLS guests gave the flats a
"real beating" each year. The guests
who had caused most trouble were
students from a University in the
Republic of Ireland. M r Hungerford
said that although he had warned the
Student Accommodation Office, the
same people who had created major
problems last year had been allowed
to return. Even some students who
were evicted after throwing a
television through a window were
given flats again this year.
M r Hungerford said that the
students had known that a court case
against them would take more than
three months, and so they could not
be evicted even though they had not
paid their rent. He said this summer
had been particularly bad now that the
students knew what they could get
away with. The SLS Managers were
shocked to discover the condition of
the flats when the guests had moved
out. Mark Cottle, one o f the
Managers, commented: " i f we hadn't
been there, there wouldn't be any
buildings left".
A visit by senior College officials,
Chief Engineer David Evans and
College Deputy Secretary Brian
Lloyd Davis, was organised by I C U
President Ian Howgate when he was
informed of the extent of the
problems. M r Lloyd Davies and M r
Evans were reported to have been
deeply concerned and M r Evans
'if we hadn't been there, there wouldn't be any buildings left'
immediately arranged for the flats to
be put in good order.
Many of the flats have been
completely repainted and a lot o f
furniture has had to be replaced. M r
Hungerford was very pleased with the
condition of the redecorated flats and
when asked on Friday, he said that he
was confident that they would be
ready for the students to move in to
at the start of term.
• Ninety seven new students were
due to move into Hamlet Gardens
over the weekend, although there
were only ninety two places available.
M r Hungerford said that he thought
this would not present a problem as
there are always some students who
do not take up their places.
There will be more than twice as
many freshers in Hamlet this year
than there were last year. Some
concern has been voiced about the
suitability of Hamlet for Freshers.
Subwarden Chris Griffen said that he
did not think the accommodation or
social life was appropriate for first
years, many of whom had just left
home.
Accommodation Office shake-up
S T U D E N T Accommodation Officer
Lesley Gillingham was removed from
her post by College Managing
Surveyor, Peter Hallworth two weeks
ago. Assistant College Secretary
Michael Arthur has been left in
charge until a new Student
Accommodation Manager has been
found. The position is to be linked
with that of a Senior Housekeeper to
provide a closer link with hall
administration and a more "smooth
and efficient service".
M r Hallworth said M s Gillingham
was removed after a series of
complaints including those from
several Wardens. It appears that
letters had been sent out late, resulting
in anxious Freshers telephoning
because they had only two days in
which to reply. Some letters contained
no reply slips and non-existant
accommodation had been offered. M r
Hallworth said that staff morale had
been at a low ebb and there were
notices in the office which he
considered to be "offensive" and
"not welcoming". He said that such
a drastic decision had been a hard one
to make but it had "proved to be the
right one". He wants the post to be
filled by "somebody who cares".
Gravel money to be invested
IT has been decided by the Finance
& Executive (F&E) Committee that
money raised by the sale of gravel at
Harlington will be invested over the
next few years. It was initially
believed that College administration
wished to use the money to back up
their cash flow reserve. This was
discovered when Harlington income
figures appeared in cash flow
calculations in the appendix of a paper
which w a s presented to the
Committee. After the
misunderstanding was cleared up, it
was decided that a separate
investment fund would be set up by
the Investments Committee o f
Governing Body to be jointly
administered by the Chairman of
Governing Body and the President of
the Union.
It has been rumoured that the Union
Executive wish to set up a Union
Investment Committee to advise the
President, and that ex-ICU President
Nick Norton may be asked to Chair
this Committee.
A final decision will be made at the
next F & E in November.
'Irresponsible' Ian attacks planned
Freshers' Week entertainment
E N T E R T A I N M E N T S Officer John
Noble has slammed comments made
by I C U President Ian Howgate as
" i r r e s p o n s i b l e " . John was
responding to comments made in an
interview Ian Howgate recorded with
IC Radio before the start of term and
which is due to be broadcast on
Wednesday.
In it Ian pays tribute to the hard
work put in by John, but says "I don't
think we have a terribly good
selection of bands in Freshers'
Week". He admits "it's better than
other London colleges" but adds "I
don't really think it's good enough".
' T have'', he continued ' 'plans afoot
to revitalise the entertainments
system; I'm talking about getting us
up into the big time. How I'm going
to do that is something I really can't
say at the moment".
John Noble told F E L I X "I hope no
one will listen to him; we have a
brilliant Freshers' Week, and lots of
people were consulted over which
bands to have, he shouldn't make
irresponsible statements like that". It
was, he added, the first time he had
heard the statement.
The two other Union Sabbaticals
said M r Howgate's views on the
bands were not Union policy and
were his own opinion. I C U Deputy
President Alan Rose said "as far as
I know all these bands are supposed
to be great fun and that's what
Freshers' Week is all about.
Bands playing in Freshers' Week
include Voice of the Beehive and the
Blue Aeroplanes, along with Rent
Party and Salvation Sunday.
John Noble later made the
following statement:
"I think an important point to make
is that what Ian is trying to say is that
in a perfect world everything would
be sweetness and roses. We would not
have the restriction of a closed club
licence on our hands, we would not
have problems with apathy and we
would not have problems concerning
our venue size. However the reality
of the situation is that we have these
problems and many more. M y duty
is to operate within the bounds laid
down by C o u n c i l and most
importantly not to overspend my
budget. Bands of the ilk of Dire
Straits etc charge fees in excess of
£100,000, if you're lucky, a figure 32
times my budget. Personally I don't
think Ian should make high fantastical
statements about a subject which he
knows little, especially without
consulting the Ents Officer."
