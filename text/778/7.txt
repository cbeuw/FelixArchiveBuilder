UPDATE
Tax probe:
Refectories cook the books
A N INVESTIGATION by the Inland
Revenue could cost IC more than
£100,000 in unpaid tax. The problem
has arisen because of the Refectories
Section's failiure to pay tax and
National Insurance for casual
workers. It is likely that the cost will
have to be covered by price increases
in refectories and bars.
The College is claiming that the
workers are self-employed and are
therefore responsible for their own tax
and National Insurance. If the Inland
Revenue does not accept this claim,
College may have to pay up to seven
years' tax.
Although Refectories will be the
hardest hit, other parts of the College,
including the Union Bar, are also
under scrutiny. This is not expected
to reveal any major problems, since
they keep better records of casual
labour. The Holland Club may be also
investigated.
A spokesman from the Finance
Section said that there had been
efforts to reform the system and that
people who undertook a lot of casual
work were put onto the payroll. He
admitted that the investigation had
taken the College by surprise and that
it was causing the administration
some concern.
If the College is faced with a large
bill, it may consider suing the
auditors, who have passed the College
accounts every year.
The Special Office of the Inland
Revenue carried out a check of the
College's books about two years ago,
as part of a general investigation into
university finance. The check did not
result in any further action against the
College. The current investigation is
being undertaken by the Inland
Revenue's local office and was
prompted by a DHSS check on part
time College workers who were also
claiming the dole.
Boat Club victory
B O A T C L U B ' S 1st I V won the
prestigious Henley Regatta Challenge
Cup, beating top university and
college teams and cutting six seconds
from the course record in the process.
Due to the Club's Henley success,
several members were selected to
represent the Britain in international
competitions, including the World
Student Games and the World
Championships. Nicholas Burfitt,
who was selected for the World
Championships, also has hopes of
rowing in next year's Olympic
Games.
Cheap Beer
I M P E R I A L College's beer supplies
are to be controlled centrally by the
Union, following discussions between
the Refectories Manager, Holland
Club Manager and I C U Deputy
President. The idea of a combined
beer order was suggested last year by
Rob Northey, the Refectories
Manager. Both the College and the
Union stand to make substantial
savings from the increased barrellage
discount and i f St Mary's Medical
School choose to join the new system,
the order will be the largest in
London.
College puts students on the streets
T E N students who had been allocated
College accommodation over the
Summer were given only three days
notice that their bookings had been
cancelled. The problem was caused
by overbooking of rooms in the
Summer Accommodation Centre.
The students were not on academic
courses and six of them were
subsequently offered alternative
accommodation. De-allocation was
necessary to accommodate
postgraduates who were guaranteed
one year in hall.
Most rooms had to be vacated by
10am on Saturday 27th June so that
conference guests could move in on
the following Monday. This was to
allow time for the rooms to be
thoroughly cleaned.
One student called the weekend as
a "ginormous farce". He described
students who got up at six o'clock to
pack and parents who drove from two
o'clock in the morning in order to
beat the deadline. Southside looked
like a refugee camp, he added.
After rumours that College
Assistant Secretary Michael Arthur
had made the decision that students
had to leave on Saturday, anonymous
notices appeared around Southside.
The notices claimed that
accommodation was available and
gave what was in fact M r Arthur's
home number. He later stated that the
rumours were "not in the slightest bit
true" and said that he had received
"one or two" calls.
NUS boycott SA
scholarships
S T U D E N T S are being dissuaded
from accepting scholarships from
I B M , Shell and Plessey, due to their
South African links, in the latest N U S
anti-apartheid campaign. They are
also putting pressure on students not
to work in South Africa and are
asking unions to stop buying Shell
Petrol for their minibuses. This new
initiative follows the success of the
Barclays campaign last year, which
forced them to withdraw after an
estimated loss of £36m student
deposits.
Hamlet trashed
RESIDENTS in Hamlet Gardens
Summer Letting Scheme were evicted
having caused £1,000 worth of
damage.
Neighbours had complained about
bottles being thrown out of windows
and excessive noise. The residents
were also falling behind with their
rent and they were eventully asked to
leave. They decided to become-
squatters, but left of their own accord
when their possessions were removed
by the managers. Inspection of the flat
revealed that the cooker had been
taken. Manager Symon Corns later
apprehended t w o intruders,
preventing them from entering the
flat.
Expedition
cancelled
T H E M O U N T A I N E E R I N G Club's
Karakoram expedition was called off
due to illness. Some members of the
team had already arrived at Karachi
and were making final preparations
for the ascent, when one of them
became ill and had to be flown back
to Britain. Expedition leader Jerry
Hasnip decided to cancel the rest of
the trip.
Prayer Room
T H E I S L A M I C Prayer Room in the
basement of Princes Gardens is being
extended after money was raised from
the Kensington Committee o f
Friendship for Overseas Students and
Imperial College Union. This will
allow an extra 40 students to pray at
any one time and provides additional
washing facilities.
