Super discovery
Scientists have still not sorted out the
mechanism of superconductivity in
the new generation o f high
temperature superconductors. In fact,
they do not even seem to understand
each other's theories.
However, they do now understand
the structure of the new compounds.
X-ray diffraction studies have shown
that there is a plane o f copper and
oxygen atoms with each copper
surrounded by four oxygens (each
oxygen is shared between two
coppers). Superconductivity is
thought to occur in this plane. Various
studies (for example, studies of how
magnetic fields affect the
superconductivity) have shown that
the superconducting bits are highly
anisotropic—superconductivity
occurs in the same crystal planes as
the CuCh layers.
The theoreticians were surprised by
the new superconductors: the theory
that satisfactorily explains the
phenomenon in metals breaks down
in the new ceramics for two reasons.
First the old theory runs into trouble
because of the high temperatures
involved (if you can call - 1 8 0 ° C a
high temperature), second it predicts
a significant isotope effect on the
transition temperature and this has
been sought but not found.
Physicists proposed a new model
involving the motion of correlated
electron pairs between copper and
oxygen without realizing that their
model was exactly the same as Linus
Pauling's model which involves
moving chemical bonds. But what are
chemical bonds but correlated
electron pairs? The trouble is that
physicists and chemists do not read
each other's journals even in fields
where they are both equally
necessary. Ceramics are midway
between the world of the physicist and
the chemist and both will be needed
if the new technology of high
temperature superconductivity is to be
understood and exploited.

You can help
The F E L I X Science Page—
F E L I X needs eager readers of the
scientific pages to compile news
stories and features for our weekly
science page. We will have both short
news items and longer features on
topical or important subjects. We
need contributors from a l l
departments to help us keep everyone
interested. If I am the only person to
write this stuff then the science section
will be heavily biased towards
chemistry, and everyone else out
there will be bored stiff. Anyway
working for F E L I X is good for your
social life and looks good on your C V
when you want a job (scientists who
can string more than two sentences
together without a serious
grammatical mistake are still rare
enough to be valuable).
Here are some of the things I would
like to see features on:
-Food additives—are they really
bad for you?
-How intelligent are intelligent
computers?
-Chemistry as molecular lego.
-Quantum mechanics: we
understand the equations, not what
they mean.
Your ideas for features will be
taken seriously if you can find
someone who knows enough to write
them. Most of all we need people to
look out for stories for us. Also, if
there are any PGs or members of staff
out there who have just made some
earth-shaking discovery, drop us a
line before you tell anyone else so we
can report it before New Scientist get
hold of it.
bullet-proof glass cabinet. Fred Hoyle
is not pleased.
Archaeopteryx was a creature with
a reptilian skeleton but well-formed
feathers. It is a fairly good example
of an evolutionary 'missing link'
between birds and reptiles. Fred
Hoyle and his colleages do not like
this as they do not believe in gradual
evolution.
Hoyle et al are astronomers (some
unkind biologists say they disbelieve
evolution because they don't
understand it) but they proposed some
photographic evidence that the
feathers were fake. They wanted to
perform other tests but these would
have required bits of the fossil to be
knocked off ("but we only want small
bits" Hoyle and friends say) and the
museum have refused their repeated
requests. There are only a handful of
the fossils in the entire world, so the
museum's stand is probably fairly
reasonable (would they let Hoyle hack
bits off the Mona Lisa if he said it was
a fake?).
The museum have performed
various tests of their own involving
spectroscopy—to test for modern
cement or artificial rock supposedly
glued to the original reptile—and
microscopy— to prove that small
calcite-filled cracks in the rock carry
through the feather impressions. They
are convinced the fossil is genuine and
they present their evidence in their
new display. Hoyle thinks they are
not fair to his case: the bullet-proof
case is probably a precaution to stop
him redressing the balance.
I would recommend a visit, but you
have to pay to get into the museum,
and I disapprove of that.
DAT versus CD
Early in September a European
consortium was set up to develop
optical disks for computer
information storage; they may be
wasting their time.
Ordinary C D s can already hold
computer information, but what
people are really waiting for is an
optical disk that can be written on
and, preferably, erased as well. Such
disks would hold Gigabytes of
information (ie about as much as 1000
standard floppy disks). Such disks and
the machines are likely to be fairly
expensive (IBM are talking about
£125 per disk and £4000 per drive.
Recent advances in D A T (Digital
Audio Tape, which is based on cheap
video technology) are likely to
produce machines at less than £400
and cassettes holding 1.2 Gigabytes
at £8. The only reasons to prefer
optical disk storage are that the
technology is more elegant and the
disks may be much faster if good
software can be written to get at the
information on them. M y bet is on
DAT: I might at least be able to afford
it.
McDonalds stop poisoning world
The world's most famous hamburger
chain is doing its bit to stop pollution:
it will soon stop using expanded
polystyrene containers that contain
chlorofluorocarbons ( C F C s for
short).
CFCs are common inert chemicals
used frequently as propellants in
aerosols and in expanded plastics.
They are now thought to destroy the
ozone in the upper atmosphere, but
the extent of the problem has only
become obvious recently with the
observation of a large hole in the
ozone layer over the Antarctic.
A treaty is now being prepared to
commit the world to a drastic
reduction of C F C use. Without such
a treaty the ozone layer may be
seriously damaged and more
ultraviolet light from the sun will
enter the lower atmosphere. This
would cause a serious increase in skin
cancer and cataracts.
M a c D o n a l d s are voluntarily
abandoning C F C s before they are
forced to, unfortunately they are not
abandoning hamburgers as well.
