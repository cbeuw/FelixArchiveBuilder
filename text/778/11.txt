Union Cards
Due to the rather parlous state of
residence security in College, it has
been decided to revise completely
security arrangements in the Halls of
Residence, particularly Southside
Halls. The upshot of this is that
whereas previously the Union Card
has been just one colour, this year
anyone in College residence will have
the privilege of a two colour Union
Card, on one side the Union colour
and the opposite face being the
residence colour.
In order to get your new style all-
singing, all-dancing Union Card, you
will need to collect a slip attesting to
your residence at the same time as
collecting your keys. You then bring
this along with your registration slip
in order to obtain your card.
This year is just a trial run for the
new style card, but College Security
will be testing the new security
arrangements for one week i n
November.
Insurance
I require an inventory for insurance
purposes from every club or society.
The forms are in your pigeonholes,
so please collect them as this is a very
important matter. Remember, if you
don't it'll end in tears.
Transport
The new van has now arrived,
hopefully by the time of printing,
Transport Committee will have
approved some minor changes to the
operation of the van fleet, so watch
out for any changes which will be
publicised fully.
Parking Permits
The application forms can be
collected from the Union Office and
must be returned by 5.30pm, this
coming Friday (9th October). The list
of allocations will be printed i n
F E L K , and any applicant not granted
one can fill in an appeal form to fight
over a few permits kept behind for
that very purpose.
Late Night Drinking
I have negotiated a deal with the
owners of 3rd Street (once the
Cromwellian), which is opposite the
Natural History Museum. We get free
entrance to the club (open till 3am)
on 3 nights a week, plus reduced
entrance on the other nights. Also on
Wednesdays, the booze will be kept
at pub prices, between 11pm and
3am. The student membership
entitiles you to free booking of the
function room as long as you can
guarantee 50 people attending. They
will be issuing student membership
cards at Freshers' Fair.
The management want to
encourage student trade, and if all
goes well we should be able to extend
the deal. Watch for adverts in F E L I X
and Exec News.
Residence Insurance
I will continue dealing with claims
until College can find someone
suitable to take this over. I only learnt
this at short notice and the handling
of this by various sections of College
admin has left me more than a little
pissed off and rather unimpressed.
Elections
At the start of this year I have several
elections to hold. These will be
announced at the first U G M and
voting will take place at the second
U G M . Most of these posts would
ordinarily be filled by now but due
to circumstances beyond my control,
still remain empty. The posts are:
Internal Services Officer
Publicity Officer
2 first year reps on Council
1 ordinary member of Council
1 ordinary member of U F C (Union
Finance Committee)
1 member of G U C delegation this
is the highest body of the University
of London
Apart from the first year reps to
Council, anyone can stand for any of
these posts. Details of what the jobs
entail can be obtained from myself as
Returning Officer.

Welfare welcome
A n introduction to the Welfare Centre
At some stage of your time at Imperial
College you may need advice or
information and not know where to
turn. The answer could well be
waiting at the Welfare Centre, 15
Princes Gardens. There, you can if
you wish see me—Linda Simmons,
Imperial College's Welfare Adviser
for confidential and impartial advice.
I can usually be found in my office
in Princes Gardens from 10am to
2.30pm Monday to Friday (ext 360.4)
and you don't usually need an
appointment.
So what sort of advice can I give?
Briefly, benefits, housing rights,
immigration, tax, insurance,
consumer affairs, financial problems
(including debt councelling), legal
problems (at least as a first stage), etc
etc. The list could easily be extended;
please ask if you have a problem that
is not mentioned here, if I can't help
I'll do my best to point you in the
direction of someone who can.
In addition to personal advice there
are leaflet racks situated outside my
office which are accessible from
9.30am to 5.30pm where you will
find a wide range of literature. Much
is from outside organisations such as
the DHSS, the Consumer Council,
Family Planning Association, and the
Department of the Environment. You
will also find information compiled
by the Welfare A d v i s e r and
Accommodation Office on subjects
such as benefits, accommodation,
housing rights and overseas students.
The Welfare Centre is completely
independent of all other parts o f
Imperial College. It can, therefore,
aim to provide an effective and
impartial service to students whose
problems impinge on another part of
the College.
As Welfare Adviser I will be
pleased to see you and try to help in
whatever way I can.
Linda Simmons,
Welfare Adviser
