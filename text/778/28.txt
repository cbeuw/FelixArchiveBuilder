The National Portrait
Gallery
A L T H O U G H portraits have never
been my favourite form of art, the
National Portrait Gallery is definitely
high on my list of favourite museums.
Unlike other galleries, the portraits
have a short explanatory note about
the subject which is a godsend for
anyone who isn't well versed in
famous people. The mixture of media
includes photographs, paintings,
drawings and cartoons and helps to
increase the interest. The 20th
Century gallery provides an
invaluable history lesson on notable
figures of our time from the fields of
art, science and politics. In addition
to the numerous permanent
collections, there are usually one or
two special exhibitions on at any one
time. At present there are two—Clive
Barker's Portraits and In Close
Up.Laurence Olivier, both relatively
small exhibitions which can
comfortably be viewed in an hour or
two.
In Close Up:
Laurence Olivier
T H E OLIVIER exhibition is again
compact, but contains some delightful
film stills and posed portraits (the
resemblance of the young Sir Larry
to Timothy Dalton is uncanny). The
Royal Dalton porcelain, model is an
interesting novelty. Showing some of
his film work is a good idea, however
the addition of a small television
delivering tinny monologues is too
much of a gimmick and distracts from
the main exhibition.
Portraits
C L I V E B A R K E R was previously
noted for his pop art, detailing
crushed cigarette packets and chrome
plating coke bottles. In this collection,
his 53 oil pastel portraits of fellow
artists, critics and friends are rather
hit and miss. They employ a variety
of bright contrasting colours which
can work very well as shown by the
portraits of George Melly (used to
advertise the exhibition) and Peter
Blake. However, in the main they fail
to please. In addition to the portraits
there are four examples of his
sculpture on display which are a
welcome bonus, in particular his Self-
portrait with bananas.
Introducing Sculpture
DOWNSTAIRS in the basement is an
interesting little exhibition giving an
introduction to sculpture. This is well
worth a visit as it provides a guide to •
the various techniques involved,
carefully distinguishing between
sculpting (working down from a lump
of stone or wood to the finished article
eg marble busts) and modelling
(working up from a frame adding
material to make a likeness eg clay
models from which bronze casts are
made). Notable exhibits include the
death mask of Oliver Cromwell and
a wonderful wooden statue of James
Joyce. A.N.
Albums
Wonderful Life—Black
Self confessed crooner C o l i n
Vearmombe has crammed a pretty
mixed bag onto Wonderful Life. The
variety is good ignoring the empty
pop of songs like / just grew tired,
when things get rather tedious.
Smarmy American female backing
suggests a funky Phil Collins, while
in some places the sound is
reminiscent of Culture Club or—dare
I say it—Tears for Fears.
However, all is not lost. There are
some real gems amidst the striking
contrasts of the brilliant title track and
the classy, melancholy Sweetest
Smile. P-S.
Gary Numan—Exhibition
A compilation double album
containing music from 1978 to 1983,
including his singles from that period.
Are Friends Electric and Cars
show why he rose to fame, the rest
show why he didn't last. A.N.
The Bolshoi—Lindy's Party
The Bolshoi are going places. From
the recent singles Please and TV Man
to new material, every song is as good
as the last. Strong guitar-based music
together with intelligent lyrics should
move this album to the top. s.G.
Singles MSIC-
New Model Army— White Coats EP
Former indie successes now with
E M I , they are still doing the college
circuit on a world scale peddling their
energetic anti-pop for the 80's.
Primarily a live outfit their studio
performance is disappointing.
Presumably the record only serves as
promotion for the forthcoming tour...
damn! It worked! A.N.
Alison Moyet & David Freeman—
Sleep Like Breathing
Yet another ballad, with the addition
of male backing so we can distinguish
this one from the last, and the one
before that... Crashing waves, roses
and soft focus—even with the addition
of excellent make-up—do not make a
good video. A.N.
Beastie Boys—Girls/She's Crafty
(double Aside)
The Beastie Boys have never managed
to improve upon their first hit (You've
gotta FIGHT for your RIGHT....).
Girls is another weak song of teenage
bawling; B side is better, with far
more of the old thumping rhythm we
all know and love. Both songs are
already on their album Licensed to III,
so don't expect a Top-10 hit.' S.G.
