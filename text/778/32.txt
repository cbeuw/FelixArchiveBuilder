KATHY TAIT
Union Receptionist
Whilst interrailing last year, one of
the countries I visited was Hungary.
As I like food very much, I stayed
there for quite some time! I absolutely
loved their goulash, but as I've never
been very good at remembering
recipes I've adapted the goulash a bit.
So it's a mixture between my mams
broth and a cassarole. I call it Kathy's
Special! Another one of my faults is
that I never measure anything, so I
suggest you adapt the quantities to
your own taste.
The Ingredients
Serves 4
1 carton of sour cream (you can
use natural yogurt)
1 small tin of tomatoes
1 medium onion
1 red pepper
1 tablespoon of tomato puree
5 or 6 small mushrooms
2 cloves of garlic
3 small carrots
1 small courgette
1 handful of frozen peas
1 slash of Worcester sauce
A good helping of black pepper
Pinch of salt
Pinch mixed herbs
1 bottle of wine (red)
You can make this with any bit of
meat you fancy. I usually use stewing
steak, and cut it up quite small. But
I have used chicken and even
sausages. Even if you're not a meat
eater, why not add more vegetables
which I've done when we've been a
bit hard up!
The Method (I think)
Use medium size casserole dish. Fry
your meat first, coat the meat in
seasoned flour. I use a little butter to
fry in. Don't over fry it, just brown
it a little. When done, pop it in your
dish and bung in the oven to keep
warm. Oh I forgot, set your oven at
no 6. Then fry your roughly cut
onions till they are soft. Same with
the red peppers. Put them both in the
pot. N o w for the carrots and
courgettes, fry them with a little
butter and add a little water just till
they are a bit soft. A d d them to the
pot.
Put the tomatoes and puree in the
pot together with your roughly cut
garlic. M i x them all together. Y o u
now can add the rest of your
ingredients. Be very careful when
adding your wine, as you have to re-
assure your guests that a bottle of
wine has gone into your dinner, when
in fact, you only need to put V* of a
70cl bottle in, the rest you can drink!
Add the sour cream last or yogurt
(Greek yogurt is the best).
This dish doesn't always turn out
necessarily the same every time, but
it's interesting finding out what it
actually does taste like!
I usually serve it with boiled rice,
but it's nice with roast potatoes. The
best thing about it is when you've got
everything in the dish, you can almost
forget about it for VA hours apart
from the occasional stir.
The British Red Cross Society
will be running a standard
certified first aid course starting
on Monday October at 6pm. The
course will run each Monday at
6pm until the examination night,
Monday 14th December. The
course will be held in the Holland
Club. The course is limited to
about 20 members, and the cost
of the course (including book and
examination) is £12.
Die Mauer-continued
using forged United Nations
passports. Incredibly this ploy
continued successfully when the East
Germans discovered that the United
Nations did not issue these particular
documents—so concerned were they
to avoid a diplomatic incident. One
East German engineer managed to
make a small fortune by patenting his
escape apparatus in the West. In fact
the engineer had managed to build the
world's first mini submarine which he
used to power his way to the West
underwater, after having first
removed some of the spiked sub-aqua
grids which were installed to protect
the waterways.
Yet for every successful attempt
there are a far greater number of
failures. According to Western
figures seventy five people have died
trying to cross the wall, but the actual
figure is probably much higher.
Hundreds more have been injured or
imprisoned. The brutality of the
Eastern Regiem was brought sharply
into focus by the protracted death of
a seventeen year old boy. Peter
Fecher, a Red Youth leader and a
friend decided to make a dash for it
one night at a point close to
Checkpoint Charlie. Under a hail of
bullets, Peter's friend managed to
diplomats were the subject of verbal
abuse and stoning for some time
afterwards.
Escape is regarded as a serious
offence by the East German
authorities, with the penalty for
fleeing the Republic Republic-
flucht—set at six years. Westerners
caught aiding escapees are invariably
accused of kidnapping the citizens of
the D D R against their wishes; they
are said to be agents sent by Bonn to
destabilise the border. After a trial of
sorts a long prison sentence and
enforced labour await, though, for
Westerners at least, there is always
the possibility that Bonn might buy
them out of jail. Conditions in East
German prisons are decidedly
unpleasant; the food is barely edible
and medical treatment is available
only on a six week waiting list—even
then the treatment is usually wrong.
There is however a glimmer of hope
for those trapped behind the wall. In
the wake of the recent summit
between the leaders of East and West
Germany new hopes have been raised
for greater freedom for the East
Germans. Senior officials in the
DDR's S E D (Socialist Unity) Party
have hinted that greater priority might
be placed on reuniting divided

haul himself through the barbed wire
above the wall, but Peter, hit by
several shots, fell back into the East.
Then, in an incident recorded by
Western T V cameras, the Vopos
surrounded the dying boy, but made
no attempts to answer his cries for
help. It took one hour for Peter
Fecher to bleed to death before the
vopos removed his limp body. It was
not surprising large scale
demonstrations followed in West
Berlin, nor that Russian troops and
families and M r Honnecker has called
for greater unity between the two
Germanies. Yet it is clear that the wall
is here to stay. The economic and
idealogical differences between the
cultures on each side of the wall
leaves the D D R with no alternative
other than to maintain the Status Quo.
