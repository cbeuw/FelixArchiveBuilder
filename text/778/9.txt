as the D D R gradually increased the
wall's defences, escape became more
complex and more expensive.
There were always those in the
Western city who were prepared to
help those trapped in the East, often
at great personal risk to themselves.
Many of these were students incensed
by the inhumanity of the wall. They
were helped financially by right wing
political parties, anti-communist
groups and the press who were always
hungry for a good escape story.
Inevitably there were those who
entered into the escape business for
their own profit and during the 1960's
a large number of 'escape firms' grew
up. Not all of the firms were reliable.
Often customers in the East would
pay extortionate amounts of money
for a half baked escape scheme which
invariably resulted in imprisonment
for the unfortunate defectors. It
became commonplace for rival firms
to betray each other to the East
German authorities; premises were
burgled, forged papers stolen, and
lists of contacts confiscated. To make
matters worse, West Berlin was
riddled with informers and East
German agents.
The Wall was responsible for
inspiring some weird and wonderful
schemes which put even Colditz to
shame. One of the strangest occured
between October 1971 and April
1973, when twenty nine people
escaped in a converted welding
machine which was being regularly
transported across the border. The
machine had been cleverly
constructed so that guards, on
removing the panels were confronted
with a tangle of wires; the secret inner
compartment remaining hidden from
view. This compartment could only
be opened by the simultaneous
operation of two mechanical switches
and an electric relay. In 1977, the
European singer, Thedorus Kerk
smuggled Renate Hagen over the
border inside a one and a half foot
square loudspeaker case, and in 1941
a girl, acting on the spur of the
moment, escaped inside a radiogram.
One of the wackiest defections was
inspired by the Trojan Horse legend.
Instead of a horse, however, the
escapee hid inside a model cow which
was being transported to the West,
ostensibly for theatrical purposes.
In his excellent book 'Escape From
Berlin' Anthony Kemp tells the story
of Wolfgang Fuchs, head of an escape
'firm' known as 'Klunte and Klunte',
and perhaps the greatest hero i n the
escape business. Staffed by
volunteers, Klunte and Klunte was
financed by outside donators and
during its time managed to rescue
well over five-hundred East Germans.
Fuchs' speciality was tunneling and
between 1963 and 1964 Fuchs
organised the construction of no less
than seven tunnels. His last and
greatest tunnel became known as
'tunnel 57', after the 57 people who
were brought to West between the 3 rd
and 5th of October 1964. The tunnel
stretched for 130 meters between a
bakery in the F D R and a disused
apartment in the D D R . It was
equipped with lighting and ventilation
unobtrusive groups could be released
into the city.
Disaster struck on the morning of
October the fifth.. .Two men appeared
at the door to the appartment and
because they were obviously very
frightened the students assumed that
they were genuine refugees despite
the fact that they did not know the
password. The men explained that
they would like to go back and collect
a friend who had apparently lost his

and took a team of forty helpers six
months to construct.
The escape operations were carried
out in strict military style; only those
individuals recommended by people
already known to the organisation
were offered help and potential
defectors were rigorously vetted.
Couriers met their East German
contacts at Friedrichstrasse station
where passwords were exchanged. As
they made their way to the derelict
apartment, Fuchs watched through
binoculars from a roof in the West.
When he was certain that they had not
been followed he radioed the go ahead
to the student volunteers waiting in
the appartment to open the outside
nerve. They returned a quarter of an
hour later with a uniformed soldier.
One of the students fired a warning
shot to give his companions a chance
to escape; the soldier opened fire and
a fusillade of shots opened out
throughout the apartment, which by
now was surrounded by the East
German guard. In the crossfire the
soldier was killed.
Although it was unclear whether or
not the soldier had been killed by the
student or by the crossfire from his
own people, the D D R extracted the
maximum publicity from the case. In
the East, civilians were moved out
from houses close to the border and
a wide death strip was established
The Isetta bubble car
door. Further passwords were
exchanged before the escapee would
be led to the concealed tunnel,
entrance. The West lay only a ten
minute crawl away; once on the other
side they were scrubbed clean and
detained for up to six hours until small
close to the wall. Meanwhile,
preoccupied with negotiations for a
day pass system which would allow
citizens in the West to visit East
Berlin, the Western government also
began a clamp down on escape
activities.
For Fuchs, this was a minor setback
and he continued with an incredible
plan which involved driving up to the
wall in a specially equipped van and
lowering steps to the other side. After
months of planning, and searching for
a suitable location the stunt was
completed succesfully. Later, Fuchs
bribed a Syrian diplomat to smuggle
out refugees. Because the East
Berliners were anxious to maintain
good international relations,
diplomatic vehicles received little
attention at the border, and the Syrian
made a number of runs before being
discovered, or more likely betrayed.
Fuchs, however, arranged for the
Syrian to be given false documents
which enabled him to escape the death
sentence which would otherwise have
awaited him on his deportation back
to Syria.
Wolfgang Fuchs under the guise of
'Klunte and Klunte' went on to
organise even more sophisticated
escapes until his retirement in 1973
when he decided to devote a sensible
amount of time to his family, his
activities having already cost him his
first marriage.
Many of the relics from the more
successful escape attempts are on
show at The Museum Of The Wall
near Checkpoint Charlie. One of the
most striking exhibits is a tiny Isetta
bubble car which managed to make
nine escape runs across the border.
Because of their size, bubble cars
were never properly searched by the
Vopos guards who assumed that they
were too small to contain hidden
passengers. However, one Westerner
found that a small person could be
secreted above the engine when the
air filter and heater were removed and
the petrol tank replaced with a small
canister. A n adjustment to the
vehicles suspension meant that the
weight of the extra passenger went
unnoticed by the Vopos.
Also on show are photographs of
a very low slung Austin Healey Sprite
sports car, with a detachable
windscreen. Much to the suprise of
the guards the car was driven
underneath the barrier at Checkpoint
Charlie with a passenger hiding
behind the rear seat. The escape
received massive publicity in the
press, and yet only a week later the
same car was successfully used by an
Argentinian in a repeat performance
of the same stunt.
The lengths to which individuals
have gone in the quest for freedom are
astounding. Balloons, hang-gliders,
forged passports, and death slides are
just a few examples. One of the more
reputable 'escape f i r m s ' ' even
managed to smuggle out refugees
