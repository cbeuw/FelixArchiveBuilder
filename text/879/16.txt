Careers Fair
I hope that you found this a big success! Congratulations Dave
Ensell for the immense amount of w o r k put into organising the
event. Also thanks to Verity Greenaway and Jeremy Burnell
for superhuman efforts and all others involved in stewarding.
All comments about the Careers Fair: venue, range of
companies, timing, information available, etc, would be
appreciated. These should be addressed to me in the Students'
Union.
I n d u s t r i a l
Relations Officer
No, this Union post does not involve pacifying N A L G O ! The
official job description for the IRO is 'to promote relations
between IC Union and Industry and Commerce'. This involves
encouraging sponsorship of the Union by maintaining a
directory of those parts of the Union w h i c h have obtained
sponsorship and using their experience to encourage further
links with industry.
In addition, the IRO chairs the Industrial Relations
Committee which overseas the Careers Fair and co-ordinates
the Union's relationship with industry.
In short, this Union post offers rewarding w o r k for anyone
interested in working with industry and provides a good
introduction to how the Union works. If you'd like to hear
more, please contact Ben Turner in the Union Office or last
year's IRO, Nick Lay (Aero 3).
