Careers Fair
It was organised, it has happened, and
now it is over, much to the relief I am
sure of the people who ran it. The setup
seems to have worked well for both the
students and the companies who
attended.
it was sad, though, to see a large and
important Union event not being attended
by the Rector. An invitation had been
extended to him, and others, by Paul
Shanley. His presence was missed though
Angus Fraser, College Managing Director,
and the others showed.
Trouble
Having experienced problems with our
paper we were unable to run the litho at
anywhere near full speed. On this
account I had to slash the number of
pages from 20 to 16. I nfortunately this
meant the loss of the Clubs, Societies' and
Sports pages (sorry Simon), together with
some other stuff. We will endeavor to
include them, with appropriate changes,
next week.
Facilities
The print unit is available to produce,
print and photocopy posters, leaflets etc
etc, on Mondays and Fridays. Please try
to restrict yourselves to these days as the
rest of the week is devoted to FELIX.
Cheese and Wine
Finally, thanks to those who attended our
Cheese, Wine, etc night on Monday. It
was a damned good freebie and most of
you missed out. Oh well, you'll just have
to wait for the next one, which probably
won't be too far off.
The trip to Circus Archaos, over the
weekend went off well. Apart from a
return visit sometime before the end of
November, we'll be off to The Jongleurs.
A good night out, to be had on 2nd
November. Come into the office to find
out more, sign up, or join in the
production of FELIX. We are still in need
of Reporters, and Writers of all sorts.
AND don't forget the free ,and copious)
quantities of w e to DE na on Thursday
nights during collating.
