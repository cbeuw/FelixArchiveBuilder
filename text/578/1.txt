Food
LAST TUESDAY afternoon
a computing first year under-
graduate found a piece of
metal in his Sherfield Refec-
tory meal.
H e had been eating quiche,
chips and sweetcorn, when he
discovered a chunk of metal in
his mouth. His friend, who was
also eating the same food, found
a piece of metal in his meal as
well.
The person concerned took the
pieces to M r Mooney, Catering
Manager, who asked what the stu-
dents had been having to eat. O n
hearing sweetcorn mentioned, he
went to the can-opener in the kit-
chens to inspect it. H e said that the
blade was old and had to be re-
placed.

Hockey
win league
F O L L O W I N G an excellent a l l -
round performance this season,
I C 1st X I finished top of their
Saturday league — Middlesex
Division 2 — collecting sixteen
points from a possible eighteen
points and were unbeaten in the
league all season. This ensures a
return to top class hockey for the
side which will remain virtually
unchanged and hopeful of success
amongst some of the big guns of
hockey.
Last Wednesday saw further
success for the side in winning the
U L U Division 1 titles at their
first attempt. In sweeping aside
all other colleges on their way to
this title the team dropped only
two points all season — a narrow
last minute defeat by oldrivalsCity
& Guilds, who look set to finish the
season in second place.
