Exec. I feel the 'views' expressed
in the aforementioned letter do
not represent the views of the
majority of the members of R S M
U n i o n , but merely those of a
select few, and therefore should
most definitely not be signed in
the name of the union.
After all, would it not be better
to defend the Mines Review for
what it is? That is, a union event,
designed to generate funds for the
U n i o n , which will be supported
because the majority of R S M
students will want to go. So why
all this needless slander and back
biting by our exec?

Voyager scientist at IC
D R G A R Y H U N T , the only British scientist currently involved in the
Voyager space project, gave a lecture last week at I C on his work in
this field.
The purpose of the Voyager space craft is to investigate and compare
the two giants of the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, and their
satellites, in particular Titan. D r H u n t outlined the path of the
Voyager II spacecraft by the use of some truly remarkable slides taken
by the Voyager crafts. The data obtained by the spacecraft has given a
wealth of information on the geophysical nature of Jupiter and Saturn.
D r H u n t was particularly excited by data obtained from Titan, a
satalite of Saturn. Voyager II has shown that Titan has a planetary
atmosphere similar to that of p r i m e v i l arth, a n d perhaps more
important, simple hydrocarbons have been detected indicating the
possibility of life.
D r H u n t said that space had to be developed and that the returns
were only just beginning to trickle in. Advances have been made in
instrumentation allowing satellites to be used more efficiently in
meterology. D r H u n t predicted that very soon, by means of the space
shuttle, zero gravity space laboratories could be used to build things
such as perfect crystals which would be useful in microelectronics. D r
H u n t then added that he would be prepared to justify space on purely
academic grounds. " W e must go out there and explore. We are the
Columbuses and Magellans of today and we must maintain our
pioneering spirit".
W h e n questioned on what would happen next D r H u n t said that
V o y a g e r w o u l d arrive at N e p t u n e in 1989 but that a l l future
programmes, such as the Gallileo Dapiter probe, would have to be
reviewed in the light of the recent Reagan spending cuts.

Pedalling
for
24 hours
L A S T W E E K E N D , thirty Guilds
people went to Bristol for the
annual 24-hour Pedal C a r Race.
T h e new car "Snotgobbler"
was built at great speed, but,
unfortunately, could not continue
in the race for more than the first
four laps. The men's team came
fifth and the ladies team came in
eighteenth overall, and were the
top ladies team.
The journey to Bristol did not
prove uneventful, as one driver
fell asleep whilst cruising along
the m o t o r w a y , h o w e v e r , no
accidents occurred.
T o n y Heales, Pedal C a r C l u b
Captain, expressed his thanks to
all those who raced, cooked, and
helped, particularly the depart-
ment of M e c h E n g .
Giles
Shaw
speaks
Former Northern Ireland J u n i o r
Minister Giles Shaw, M P visited
the College last Tuesday at the
invitation of the Conservative
Society to give a talk on 'The
L a s t E i g h t e e n M o n t h s i n
Northern Ireland'. M r Shaw,
who became a junior Environ-
ment Minister in M r s Thatcher's
r e c e n t r e s h u f f l e , b e g a n b y
outlining the background to the
p r e s e n t s i t u a t i o n , a n d t h e n
proceeded to comment on the
security and political issues in the
last eighteen months.
H e s a i d t h a t the l e v e l of
terrorist a c t i v i t y o v e r a l l was
steadily declining, with terrorism
confined to limited areas. The
police force was gradually taking
over security duties f r o m the
army, with the eventual aims of
restoring normal policing and
the rule of law to the province.
MoreNorth/Southcooperation
is coming about on security, and
M r Shaw said he believed there
was a greater understanding by
the R e p u b l i c of the N o r t h ' s
problems and a willingness to
work together to defeat terrorism.
O n the politcal front, M r Shaw
said it was almost impossible to
distinguisharoute toacompromise

g o v e r n m e n t s m u s t c o n t i n u e
along the 'thorny road' in an
effort to find a solution because
the troubles are not going to go
away. The audience of about fifty
was t h e n g i v e n a c h a n c e to
question M r Shaw.
