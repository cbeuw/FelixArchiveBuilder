Study in the Shadow of the Gun
Bir Zeit University is a Palestinian
institution in the Israeli-occuppied
territory of the West Bank. More
than 1,500 students are currently
taking degree courses in both the
Arts and Sciences. Israel regards Bir
Zeit as a "hotbed of nationalism",
often c o n f l i c t i v e with its o w n
ambitions for the West Bank, and a
voice to be silenced. The students,
faced with the continuing denial of
their political rights, on occasion go
out onto the streets to demonstrate.
The resulting clashes with the Israeli
military authority add to the cycle of
tension.
The Youth Council of the United
Nations Association is hosting a
s p e a k i n g t o u r of two s t u d e n t
representatives from Bir Zeit. They
are c o m i n g to this College on
Thursday, March 5 to give a talk in
the Union Senior Common Room
starting at 1:00pm. This is a unique
opportunity of hearing first-hand
about the situation facing fellow
students studying under military
occupation. Don't miss this oppor-
tunity: all are welcome.
The following is a very brief
b a c k g r o u n d to the Palestinian
jrobiem.
The early history of Palestine
In very early times, Palestine was
inhabited by Semitic peoples, the
earliest being the Canaanites. When
the Tribes of Israel came to Palestine
after their captivity in Egypt, they
vere united into one kingdom by
King David in 1000BC. This kingdom
reached its greatest heights under
King David's son, Solomon, who
built the first Temple of Jerusalem.
However, after Solomon's death, the
history of the People of Israel (or
rather of the two kingdoms of Israel
and Judah) is a record of civil wars
and struggles with alien tribes.
720 B C : Assyrians destroyed the
Kingdom of Israel and carried its
inhabitants away as captives.
u O O B C : T h e B a b y l o n i a n k i n g ,
Nebuchadenezzar, attacked the
Kingdom of Judah.
»67BC: Jerusalem and Solomon's
' emple were destroyed by Nebuch-
adenezzar. Most of the inhabitants
were taken captive.
5 1 7 B C : Jews were able to return to
Palestine.
332BC: Domination by the Mace-
donians, who treated the Jews
harshly. Following the Macedonian
rale was a period of certain indepen-
dence.
C ' J B C : R o m a n conquest under
Fompey.
i ' A D : Emperor Hadrian prohibited
the Jews from entering Jerusalem.
From this period dates the disper-
sion of the Jews throughout the
world. Since then, until the establish-
nent of the State of Israel in 1948,
no Jewish Government has existed
in Palestine. Although some Jews
I ^ve always lived in Palestine, their
numbers have fluctuated depending
on the tolerance of the successive
rulers.
7 0 A D : Titus destroyed Jerusalem.
4 0 0 A D : The partitioning of the
Roman Empire. Palestine under
Byzantium's rule until:-
6 3 7 A D : Arab conquest. After the
interlude of the Crusades, the Arab
ruler invited the Jews to return to
Palestine.
1 5 1 7 A D : T u r k s conquered the
country and ruled it until the end of
the First World War (forming part of
the Ottoman Empire).
Therefore it can be seen that,
except for the C r u s a d e r inter-
regnum, Palestine was ruled by
Arabs and then by Turks for over
1,300 years following the Byzantine
era.
The recent history of Palestine:
"The Palestine Question"
The defeat of the Turkish armies
during the First World War, with the
assistance of the Arab uprising
(some Arab leaders at the time were
seeking independence from Ottoman
rule) resulted in the break-up of the
Ottoman Empire. The administration
of Palestine was then handed to the
British Government.
H o w e v e r , two c o n t r a d i c t o r y
promises had been made during the
campaign to defeat the Turks. One
was to assure ultimate independence
for the Arab peoples of the region, in
return for assistance in defeating the
Turkish army. The other was the
Balfour Declaration of 1917 which
granted the wish of the Zionist
leadership in Europe to establish a
Jewish homeland in Palestine.
In the following decades, Jewish
immigration came into direct conflict
with the livelihoods of the Palestinian
peasantry. Tracts of land were sold
by absentee Arab landlords to the
Jewish National Fund, which in turn
led to the dispossession of the Arab
tenants as the Jewish settlements
were established. T h r o u g h the
twenties and thirties, frequent
clashes between the communities
took place sometimes resulting in
many deaths.
At the end of the Second World
War, the British Government came
under increasing pressure to allow
large numbers of Jewish refugees
from Europe to settle in Palestine,
a n d f a c e d with an i m p o s s i b l e
situation they decided to hand the
problem over to the United Nations.
The U N decided upon a partition
plan to divide Palestine into two
areas, one with a predominantly
J e w i s h p o p u l a t i o n , the othe r
predominantly Arab. Whilst accept-
able to the Zionist leadership, albeit
a compromise with their wishes, the
Arab states refused to agree with
partition, such that with the ending
of the British mandate in 1948, war
broke out between the newly-
c r e a t e d Israeli state a n d the
neighbouring Arab states.
As a result of the war, and the
conflict leading up to it, most of the
Arab population of Palestine fled,
while the West Bank carne under the
c o n t r o l of the J o r d a n i a n army.
Jordan formally annexed the West
Bank in 1950.
In 1967, yet another war ravaoed
the region leaving the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights
a n d S i n a i in the hands of a n
occupying Israeli army.
Since 1967, administration of the
West Bank and the other occuppied
territories has rested with a military
government. It is directly answerable
to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and
has absolute authority over the
Palestinian population.
T h e P a l e s t i n i a n p e o p l e now
number approximately four million.
About half a million of the Palestinians
live in Israel. Another 1,200,000 live
in the occuppied territories of the
West Bank and Gaza. The remain-
der are in exile, many still in refugee
camps, many as foreigners in other
countries. The majority of those in
exile still hope to return to their own
country.
Professor Arnold Toynbee wrote
in 1968: "The tragedy in Palestine is
not just a local one: it is a tragedy for
the World, because it is an injustice
that isa menacetothe World'speace".
The Recent Situation
The recent violent street battles in
the West Bank in which Israeli
troops shot at and wounded un-
armed Palestinian student demon-
strators received considerable
attention in the W o r l d ' s Press.
Higher Education has now emerged
as the focus for the continuing
struggle between Jews and Arabs in
the West Bank.
Bir Zeit University is an indepen-
dent Palestinian institution, located
about twelvemilesnorthof Jerusalem.
It teaches to B A and BSc level in Arts
and Sciences, and its degrees are
now recognised throughout the
World.
One of the major objectives of the
University is to encourage students
to stay in the West Bank and work
with their community, rather than to
seek more lucrative employment in
the Gulf or the West. Therefore
each student must complete a
programme of community work
each year, which is then counted
t o w a r d s the final d e g r e e , the
purpose being to encourage greater
awareness and critical discussion by
the students of the problems facing
the community. The 1,500 students
in the University have to spend at
least 120 extra-curricular hours on a
community work programme. Dr
M u h a m m e d Hallaj, Dean of the
Faculty of A r t s , says that the
students "must be actively involved
in the daily life of their l o c a l
communities; higher education must
not serve as a form of escapism".
Trouble started at the University
early in 1980 when the native Arab
West bankers demonstrated their
full opposition to the Camp David
"autonomy" plan about which they
had not been consulted, and which
numerous U N bodies had con-
demned as bearing little resem-
blance to Palestinian self-deter-
mination.
The growth of a sizeable student
body in the West Bank vigorously
opposing the Israeli occupation and
any attempt to impose the Camp
David agreements clearly alarms the
Israelis, as shown by the recent
h a r s h a c t i o n a g a i n s t s t u d e n t
demonstrators. The recent moves
against the universities (Bir Zeit and
the three other Palestinian univer-
sities) are only the latest of a series
of problems experienced by the
universities as a result of operating
under occupation.
The problems include the 'invasion'
of c a m p u s e s by the m i l i t a r y ,
closures (Bir Zeit was closed down
for months in 1979), the refusal of
the military authorities to allow the
entry of certain Arabic books and
periodicals, despite the fact that they
are available to students at the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
and difficulties over obtaining work
permits for foreign members of
faculty.
Although these problems created
headaches for University admin-
istrators, they did not affect the
University's basic freedom. Order
No 854 issued by the West Bank
Military Governor in July of 1980
was thus particularly ominous, as it
was aimed at curbing that freedom
and enabling the occupation author
ities to interfere to an unprecedented
extent. It stipulated that universities
must be licensed, implying that the
licence could be withdrawn. This is
seen as placing the Universities
under permanent threat of closure.
It also said that the names of all
faculty members and students must
be approved by the occupation
authorities, in order to 'weed out'
those who had been committed for
s e c u r i t y offences or held for
questioning — and almost every
Palestinian West Bank family has
members who fall into this category.
All courses of study are subject to
the approval of the military governor
— again, an entirely new kind of
restriction. University students say
that in recent weeks their notebooks
have been seized and scrutinised by
the occupation authorities.
The universities have refused to
comply with the new decree, which
aims to 'undermine the University's
status, its independence, its legiti-
mate functions and its academic
freedom," as a statment issued by
Bir Zeit said. The statement pointed
out that the decree, by amending the
Jordanian Law of Education and
Culture of 1964, contravened the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949
which stipulates that an occupying
power does not have the right to
introduce changes in the laws of the
country under occupation.
The content of education is also a
source of growing dissatisfaction. As
Dr Ibrahim Abulughod who headed
the Palestine O p e n U n i v e r s i t y
feasibility study team says: "The
Palestinians in higher education
have been educated in accordance
with a c u r r i c u l u m over w h i c h
Palestinians have absolutely no
control. Since these curricula have
been designed by the national
authorities of various countries, they
were designed, if they were designed
at all, in the light of the needs of
those societies. The curricula in all
these countries have nothing to do
with the identity of the Palestinian,
with his heritage, with his future
aspirations. They are not designed to
serve the needs of Palestinian
society, they are not informed by
Palestinian heritage and culture".
Bir Zeit University is frequently
seen as a threat to Israeli authority in
the West Bank. Come and hear two
students from this University on
Thursday, March 5 at 1:00pm in the
Union Senior Common Room.
