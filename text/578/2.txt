Dear Mr Marshall
T h e remarks which you made
in your F E L I X Editorial last
week about H R H Princess Anne
are utterly despicable. E v e n if
you hold these views in private it
is completely disloyal to publish
them. As for criticising Princess
A n n e for her hobby (at which she
was very good) it smacks of the
lower middle class intolerance
that we have come to expect from
F E L I X this year. Princess Anne
does a good deal of charity work
(e.g. National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to C h i l -
dren) for w h i c h she receives
inadequate credit from gutter
press editors like yourself. In
closing I would suggest that you
a p o l o g i s e a n d t h e n d o t h e
honourable thing.
lours very sincerely

Sir
W i t h reference to your com-
ments of Princess Anne, you Sir
are obviously excluded from the
23,000 students " w i t h brains".
F o r one w h o c a n express
himself in such a childish and
insulting manner should never
h a v e b e e n e l e c t e d to e d i t
the College or any other maga-
zine, and as regular readers of
F E L I X , my colleagues and I are
d i s g u s t e d by y o u r o b n o x i o u s
inference to the Princess (sic).

Sir
W e feel much ashamed to be
m e m b e r s of a C o l l e g e whose
" n e w s p a p e r " publicises such
malicious insults as contained in
your last editorial. F r o m your
description H R H Princess Anne
seems to be a much more chari-
table person than yourself.
Whatever you may think of
our new Chancellor it was very
w r o n g of you to m a l i g n one
member of our R o y a l Family as
this is also a direct insult upon
o t h e r m e m b e r s for w h o m we
have reason to have much respect
and regard.
W e find it hard to corrtprehend
that y o u r e d i t o r i a l is a true
thermometer of the feelings of the
I C U Exec and even less of the
vast majority of students at I C .
W e think that the Exec would
be well advised to remove you as
editor of F E L I X before you cause
any more m u d to be splattered
over us all.
Yours regretfully

Dear Sir
Y o u may hold the opinion that
Princess A n n e is not suitable for
t h e C h a n c e l l o r s h i p o f t h i s
University, but there is not cause
to be downright abusive.
Yours

Dear Sir
O n e of the golden rules of good
j o u r n a l i s m is that i n d i v i d u a l
members of the R o y a l Family are
not 'fair game'.
O n e of the hallmarks of bad
journalism is sensationalism. It is
the last resort of the uninspired
and tired.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
Not content with repetitively
a t t a c k i n g M r M o o n e y to the
p o i n t o f u t t e r t e d i u m a n d
p r i n t i n g racist a n d g e n e r a l l y
insulting cartoons, you have now
l o w e r e d y o u r s t a n d a r d s of
j o u r n a l i s m even f u r t h e r w i t h
your pathetic and puerile attack
on Princess A n n e in your editorial
last week.
Whatever your views of our
new Chancellor (my own are
h a r d l y c o m p l i m e n t a r y ) , there
can be no defence against your
using F E L I X to air such vehement
abuse against any i n d i v i d u a l
without the slightest attempt at
p r o v i d i n g j u s t i f i c a t i o n . Y o u r
cheap attack on such an easy
target was n e i t h e r clever nor
amusing, and I must presume
that you did not consider the
harm that would be done if a
representative of the mass media,
searching for student reaction to
the choice of Chancellor, were to
seize upon your remarks as being
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of the student
body at I C . T h e public would
surely c o n c l u d e that it is us,
rather than Princess Anne, who
possess the 'intellect of a cab-
bage'. O r perhaps you were
encouraged by such thoughts,
since you appear to enjoy cheap
publicity.
If you manage to complete
your term as F E L I X Editor, I
hope you will continue to express
your opinions, but please refrain
from using unjustified and highly
personal abuse.
Yours faithfully

Sir
W i t h reference to the article
e n t i t l e d O p e r a t i c D i v e r s i o n
Diversion, I note with more than
a little trepidation that the dates
given for this opera clash with the
dates a l r e a d y b o o k e d for the
H A M D R A M 81 (Home C o u n -
ties Amateur Dramatic Festival)
Finals. As this is the first time
such a prestigious festival has
been hosted by Imperial College
it w o u l d be t r a g i c i f it were
marred by a bookings oversight.
Is there some mistake? W e would
hate to disappoint those who
have already purchased tickets
for H A M D R A M 81 (available
from the Bookshop or I C Dramsoc
m e m b e r s ) a n d hope that last
week's article was incorrect.

Ed's Comment: D r a m s o c have
assured me the situation is totally
under control.
Sir
I write in response to D V
Molesworth's foolish display of
i g n o r a n c e i n h i s l e t t e r o f
February 6 for F E L I X .
L e t me q u o t e t w o o f his
sentences: " I am not so naive that
I believe there is no injustice in
the R e p u b l i c " . T o blind D V
Molesworth, the obvious injus-
tice is not so important to be
condemned. ". . . these firms
especially some of them . . .are
p r o b a b l y l e a d i n g the w a y to
n a r r o w i n g the gaps b e t w e e n
'blacks' and 'whites' standard of
l i v i n g " . If D V Molesworth is
a w a r e of the different l i v i n g
standards based on colour, then
he ought to be aware of the
injustice in the system he admires
so much.
Perhaps, we will forgive D V
Molesworth for being so naive to
realise that being white in South
Africa, he was in such a privi-
laged position — high wages,
lots of incentives, etc. — as to pay
no a t t e n t i o n to the injustice
m e t e d on others. H e is n o w
being used (from the tone of his
last paragraph) to augment the
white population and match the
p o p u l a t i o n i m b a l a n c e i f not
white majority. W h a t he should
bear in mind is: South Africa can
never be another Australia or
N o r t h America.
Has D V Molesworth been a
black South African and seen his
wife for only two days in a month
a n d h a d seen his little sister
gunned down over a protest in
the Soweito-clash, he won't believe
that as justice.
M a y b e D V Molesworth will
be happy to hear of Botha's latest
promised to improve the position
of B l a c k s by a l l o w i n g a few
Blacks' black-representatives in
P a r l i a m e n t . I r e p h r a s e his
s t a t e m e n t as the c r e a t i n g of
Muzorewa's (Black puppets) to
undermine the liberation move-
ments. I assure him and Botha
that the liberation war continues
unabated and that paying a lip
service to democracy does not
weaken the efforts. If he wants to
be a disciple and a propagandist
of an Apartheid regime then he
s h o u l d be p r e p a r e d to c l a i m
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y fo r the v e r y
difficult times yet to come.
Let us be frank, D V Moles-
worth is not becoming anti-Anti-
Apattheid as he claims. H e is for
the Apartheid regime. T o be an
anti-Anti-Apartheid is to be pro-
Apartheid, there is no middle
t e r m . H e t r i e s to h i d e his
boldlessness by a long phraseo-
logy.
R e a d i n g his letter, I can now
understand how the holocaust of
the Jews, the genocide of A m e r -
i n d i a n s , the slavery a n d the
d o m i n a t e d e c o n o m y of the
blacks, etc., have been possible.
Yours truly

Dear Steve
T h e article of M r Paul Simons
on guide to farting ( F E L I X 577)
leads me to believe that he seems
to think that he has fired the last
shot as far as u n d e r s t a n d i n g
f a r t i n g is c o n c e r n e d . W h i l e I
appreciate his attempt to scien-
t i f i c a l l y analyse this s o c i a l l y
s t i g m a t i s e d p h e n o m e n o n , I
should like to point out that a
more detailed analysis than his
has been in existence for nearly a
century. I refer to The Art of
Farting or the Sly Artilleryman'.i
Manual by C o u n t T r u m p e t ,
Doctor of the Brass Horse. This
f a s c i n a t i n g piece of r e s e a r c h ,
which bears no date, seem to have
a p p e a r e d i n the n i n e t e e n t h
century in France. A n d thanks to
Salvador D a l i , who reproduced it
as a n a p p e n d i x to his a u t o -
biography, a greater number of
people will be able to understand
and appreciate this noble art now
(see, Salvador Dali, Diary of a
Genius - An Autobiography, A p -
pendix 1, pp 217-251, Picador,
L o n d o n 1976).
C o u n t T r u m p e t begins the
prelude to his work by saying: "II
