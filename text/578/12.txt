Consoc Opinion Poll
The Consoc opinion poll, while not necessarily
representative of IC as a whole certainly
contains some very interesting results.
By far the most interesting result is that a
substantial majority "don't know" when asked
about John Passmore, Liz Lindsay, and Rachel
Snee. The main way they are likely to get
"known" is through the pages of FELIX and
unless they do something to alleviate the
stagnant state of I C U soon, they are liable to
be forgotten completely.
It amazes me that it is just these type of
people who are awarded pots and U G A s at the
end of the year for "their unfailing devotion to
the Union".
I think Scaramouche is gradually taking over
the back page. Aaarrrgh!!!!!!
M o r e p r o b l e m s for P r i m e l i a C o l l e g e
O r c h e s t r a . T h e y have been planning an
informal musical evening for the week after
their c o n c e r t , but apart from a general
consensus that it should consist of five pieces,
the third being for oboe and piano, everyone
has a different opinion over what music should
be played.
Nevertheless, after much discussion, the
following has been agreed on. There must be a
piece for clarinet and piano immediately before
a piece by Beethoven. Something by Mozart
should immediately follow a piano trio. There
must be a string quartet, which cannot be
played next to the piano trio, but must go next
to a work by Brahms. A n d there must be a
piece by Schumann, and a piece for horn next to,
but on opposite sides of, a piece by Saint-Saens.
N o w t h e r e must be a way to please
everyone. But how?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office. There is a prize of £5 (donated
by Mend-a-Bike) and two tickets to the IC
Orchestra concert for the correct entry
randomly selected at 1:00pm next Tuesday.
Last Week's Solution
J_ I J_ 2_ 2_
4 , 4 , 2 " 3n , 3TT .
Imagine the can divided into two identical
cylinders, and consider the top cylinder. After
the first p o u r i n g , the empty part of this
cylinder is the same size and shape as the part
which contains beer. Thus the first student
gets a quarter of the beer.
A n identical argument applied to the whole
can shows that half the beer remains after the
second pouring. So the second student gets a
quarter of the beer.
N o w to calculate the fourth (and thence the
third) student's share, I'm afraid you do have
to use calculus, but there's one easy approach
and several hard ones. The easy way is to take
volume elements parallel to the axis of the
cylinder. T h e F E L I X typesetter won't do-
mathematical symbols, so we'll have to change
typeface here.
Now the volume elements are rect-
l
angular with length x.— and width
2 2
2/(r - x ) . So the volume required is
V = JJj x . | . 2 / ( r 2
- x2
) dx
21 ,r .
11
x2
)* dx
r

, 2 2,2 ,r
[- ^Cr - x ) ]0

o 2
3 * .
Since the volume of the whole can is
2 2
Tir I , the last student's share is -r—
1 2 ^
and so the third student gets ^ - -JJJ-
The winner is A Shiekh.
There can't be many students at IC who
don't have A-level maths, and so I had no qualms
about setting a puzzle which needs calculus
even if it did cause several people to pour
coffee over their lecture notes last Friday.
This week's puzzle, in case you haven't
guessed, is a plug for IC Symphony Orches-
tra's concert on March 6, not to mention their
informal musical evening on March 12. Next
week's puzzle is a plug for IC Choir. Mend-a-
Bike are still offering discounts to F E L I X
readers. A n d I feel more like an advertising
agency every week.
