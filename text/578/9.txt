Committee on Academic Organisation
This Committee was set up about this time last
year within the non-medical side of the university
to consider and recommend in broad terms what
redeployment of resources available for non-
medical studies within the University should be
adopted in order to maintain academic excellence
in its teaching and research, having regard to the
need to make financial economics and to attempt
to safeguard the future of all staff employed within
the University.
The committee have recently produced a
'Discussion document' which is fairly detailed in
its financial estimations and in the options
available. It is unfortunate however that
throughout the document most references and
statistics are made about 'the non-medical of the
University (excluding Imperial College)'. This
happens because IC is funded directly from the
University Grants Committee (UGC) while the
other colleges which are funded by the U G C
through the Court of the University.
Thus the document would appear to have little
direct relevance to IC but on reading through it, it
becomes obvious that the problems that face the
rest of the University are the problems that face
IC also, although to a varying extent.
The D i s c u s s i o n D o c u m e n t outlines the
financial prospects which have resulted from
various Governmental decisions.
The drop in U G C income to the non-medical
University (excluding IC) will be 17.6% by 1982/3.
This will occur because the Government is
removing that part of the Treasury Grant to the
U G C which has in the past kept overseas student
tuition fees below the 'full cost' rate.
Thus if all overseas students remained and paid
the 'full economic cost' to study here the grant
would not decrease.
Overseas student numbers have dropped and
it is assumed by the Committee that they drop by
50%. The Committee estimates that the drop in
student numbers in London will be about 10% and
the drop in income will be 15%.
The other main threat to income is in birthrate
which produces a consequent drop in numbers of
eighteen year-olds, so that by 1995/6 the number
of eighteen year-olds will be 69% of today's
number. This fall is mainly in the lower social
classes which are less likely to send students to
University.
Also the cash limits policy which presently
applies will cause a reduction in real grant if pay
increases are above the percentage recom-
mended by Government.
The Committee then ask if their assessment is
correct and if so how are the problems to be
solved.
There are constraints on any action taken.
Firstly the schools of the U n i v e r s i t y are
constitutionally autonomous but the financial
decisions can be taken by the Court. Secondly
there is the principle of 'academic tenure' i.e.
when a lecturer is appointed he can remain until
retirement — that is the basis of the contract and
as such, reduction or redeployment of staff is
difficult to say the least. Lastly there is a natural
resistance to change.
The possible solutions are:
1. Do nothing! This is not really viable.
2. Distribute the diminished grant equitably
among schools; thus those who have a high
proportion of overseas students would be cut
most e.g. S O A S .
3. Cut each school equally by about 15-20%.
This is a policy of 'pernicious anaemia'.
The implementation of either of these solutions
would lead to a possible 15% reduction in wages
and salaries expenditure. The choice being
between fewer and smaller departments. Smaller
departments are undesirable primarily for
academic reasons i.e. same number of lectures
for fewer students, isolation of staff, replacement
of staff in specialised fields, etc.
The methods by which staff can be reduced are
N a t u r a l W a s t a g e a n d f r e e z i n g of p o s t s ,
Voluntary Retirement or Redundancy. Natural
wastage would take a long time to implement and
mainly senior staff would be affected. This would
mean that senior staff would account for less than
40% of all staff as is laid down by U G C . Voluntary
retirement would cost too much.
Redundancy might be least harmful. But again
the question of A c a d e m i c T e n u r e arises.
Termination of contract may lead to court action
for wrongful dismissal. A special fund would be
required. A l r e a d y the C V C P (Cttee Vice
Chancellors and Principals) has asked the
Government to set up a special redundancy fund
for universities.
HOUJ it affects IC
The Discussion Document itself refers to IC very
little but the financial problems faced by the
University are faced on a lesser scale here. At
Finance and E x e c u t i v e C o m m i t t e e s staff
redundancies were well discussed; one problem
being that the time will come when the College
does not have the money to make redundancies.
That time is not far off.
Overseas student numbers here have fallen to
771 (994 in 1979/80; 1,074 in 1978/9). The
proportion of overseas students now at College is
16.9% (21.3% in 1979/80; 23.1% in 1978/9).
Numbers will continue to fall for at least a further
two years by which stage the 'full cost' fees will
have been implemented. In effect the lack of
overseas students (and their fees) and the lack of
money from Government will have a serious
effect on the College and on the University. The
Government does not realise the seriousness of
the problem which its own policy imposes on
universities.
What happens in the rest of the University will
not affect IC financially. Perhaps we are better off
as our future is in our own hands unlike some of
the smaller colleges who may face closure by the
University.
The discussions in IC which have been initiated
bv the Swinnerton-Dver discussion document are
those which would lead to independence from the
University. This would remove the University
administration and leave us as a University in our
own right validating our own degrees, etc.
For IC Union it raises the question of facilities
which we share as part of the U n i v e r s i t y
particularly sporting facilities. It also raises the
problem of the voice the Union has in student
matters which has been channelled through U L U
in the past.
Responses to the Discussion Document must
be returned by March 31. It will be discussed in
College at Board of Studies and Governing Body
before then. We will discuss it at External Affairs
and Council with the odd O P E N Meeting for good
measure on Wednesday, March 4. in the Lower
Refectory at 7:00pm.
