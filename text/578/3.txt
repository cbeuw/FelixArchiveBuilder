M r Mooney told F E L I X that
the metal could have come from
saucepans or cans. W h e n he
found out that the meal had
included canned sweetcorn, he
went to the c a n - o p e n e r . T h e
piercing nail on it was blunt, and
it ran up a r i m on the can. As
soon as he knew about it, he had
the nail changed straightaway.
T h e r e was a s i m i l a r i n c i d e n t
earlier in the week, but no one
had brought it to his attention.
H e had apologised to the student
concerned, but as he had made
such a 'song and dance" about it
he would not get a refund.
O n the subject of College food
generally, M r Mooney said that
he would have to take people's
word for it if they thought the
food was g e t t i n g better, as a
suggestion which F E L I X put to
h i m . A s k e d about the better
chips this term from the U n i o n
Refectory, he said that the supply
had been changed, and as this
was f o u n d a c c e p t a b l e it was
decided to continue it.

UC Sit-in on
Overseas Fees
S T U D E N T S at University College L o n d o n started an occupation of
their College's administrative block, in an attempt to persuade their
college not to increase fees to overseas students.
A n emergency U G M motion three weeks ago noted inter alia
"discrimination reached intolerable proportions with the introduction
of so-called 'full cost' fees for overseas students of ,£2,000 for Arts
courses, and £3,000 for Science courses . . . served only to further
enhance the elitist and racist nature of higher education in Britain. The
Government had to give colleges a special exemption from the Race
Relations Act 1977 before they could implement these increases". The
motion went on to instruct the Executive to obtain an assurance from
College not to increase fees next year. T h e college d i d not give such a
guarantee, but did agree not to impose a previously decided extra 10%.
A n emergency U G M motion a week later noted, inter alia "the full
cost fees a r e d r i v i n g overseas a w a y . T h e r e is no f i n a n c i a l
argument in favour of full cost fees, and college cannot therefore claim
that it is under financial obligation to charge these fees". A motion on
them called for " A total boycott of lectures on Februry 24, pickets of all
entrances/main departments". This was declared "the beginning and
not the e n d " .
A n d emergency U G M motion a week later resolved, inter alia "to go
into immediate occupation of college until college take a stand against
full-cost fees. T o support the N U S National L o b b y of Parliament on
M a r c h 11". In a statement issued by the U n i o n , students were urged to
support the boycott. After outlining why it was thought the increase in
fees was discriminatory and incorrect is said "only il we say boldly and
clearly that these fes are wrong, wrong, wrong, will there be any
change. A n occupation is the only way open to us now to make that
message clear. Other colleges will follow if we take a stand. Support the
occupation".
Last Tuesday, students occuppied the administration section at I C
and this was coninuing on Wednesday. U C students visited IC on
Wednesday afternoon to ask for support for their campaign, the aim
being action all over L o n d o n against the "discriminatory lee increase
a n d the general attack on education".
A l l unions are being asked to "take action" if college authorities
intend to implement the fee increase, organise a one day lecture
boycott, and, as a last resort, ocupy College administration.
I C U staged a week-long sit-in in the Sherfield Senior Dining R o o m
last year, this was once again on teh overseas students differential lees
issue. This protest, although led by the Exec, did not achieve its aims,
which were to get assurances from the Prime Minister, and Secretary ol
State for Education asking for a review of the Government's Education
policy, with particular regard to overseas students. Those people who
participated i n last year's sit-in did not feel it was totally in vain.
T H E I N T E R N A T I O N A L P A R T Y , the culmination of International Week,
was highly successful. The evening included Dinner, with Indian,
Chinese, Sri Lankan, and Greek foods. Afterwards there were stage
performances in the J C R . This included Greek, Latin American and
classical Indian dances, a karate demonstration by a group including
eight black belts. Bhangra dances were performed by a student group
who have only been practicing for a few months.
The Rector and 600 other people attended the event, which most
regarded as the best international party so far, and the most popular
event in the J C R this year.

that she thought Charles Fuller
