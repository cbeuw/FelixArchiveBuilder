is a shameful matter, dear reader,
t h a t i n s p i t e o f y o u r l o n g
experience of farting you still do
not know how you fart, or how
you ought to fart. It is commonly
thought that farts differ only in
size a n d that basically they are
all of the same type. A gross
error" (Dali, op cit, p217). T h e
analysis of M r Simons is faulted
by the same error.
As the learned scholar points
out, farts can be divided into
v o c a l s , a n d m u t e s o r s i l e n t
creepers. V o c a l farts m a y be
f u r t h e r d i v i d e d i n t o : (i) T h e
Pleuri-Vocal or B i g Fart (further
s u b - d i v i d e d i n t o s i m p l e a n d
d i p t h o n g o r d o u b l e - b a r r e l l e d
farts), a n d (ii) the Semi-Vocal or
Little Fart (further sub-divided
into Clear, M e d i u m a n d Aspir-
ated).
" M u t e farts, vulgarly known
as silent creepers, have no sound
and comprise a small amount of
very damp wind. In L a t i n they
are called Visia, from the verb
visire; in G e r m a n Fiesters; and in
Engish, fitch or v e t c h " (Dali, op
cit, p234). They may be either
dry or sunny.
T h e Count further classifies
according to the social status of
people (followers of M a x Weber
o u g h t to be p l e a s e d ) , g o i n g
largely by the subtle differences
in smell. T h e categories he lists
are: Provincial Farts, Household
Farts, Maiden's Farts, Fencing
Masters' Farts, Y o u n g Ladies
Farts, M a r r i e d Women's Farts,
Bourgeois Women's Farts, Pea-
sant Women's Farts, Shepher-
desses' F a r t s , O l d W o m e n ' s
F a r t s , B a k e r s ' F a r t s , C l a y
Potters' Farts, Whores' Farts,
Cuckolds' Farts, Clerks' Farts,
Actors' a n d Actresses' Farts a n d
finally, Learned M e n ' s Farts. I
a m sure even M r Simons would
agree that this is definitely a
more definitive guide to the art of
farting than his.
For those, who even in this day
and age, persist in their prejudice
against farting, there is a chapter
on Ways of Disguising a Fart
(chapter 12). This work of art is
sheer pleasure to read. A s the
author points out. " I t is indeed
m o r e i m p o r t a n t t h a n people
normally imagine, to know how
to fart in the right way at the
right time.
A fart that tries vainly to come
out,
A n d then turns back in fury to
send the flanks,
Often causes death.
For the life of a constipated
mortal through the dark portal
entering,
By a F A R T let out i n time
might well have been saved."

Dear Sir
Obviously M r Simons, author
of last week's "Definitive Guide
to F a r t i n g " is not a true devotee
of the art of farting. I a m fully in
accordance with his observations
o n t h e s o m e t i m e s p a t h e t i c
attempts of amateurs to " p i t c h "
or "tease" a fart, but I must
strongly object to his advocating
rebasing an S B D . . a n d then
disclaiming it!!
As a founder member of the
Flatulence is Artful, Relaxing
and Transcendental Soc. I a m
therefore drafting this short note
to point out to your readership
that farting should be looked on
with P R I D E , and not denied as a
shy perversion.
Extensive field research has
shown that 99.9% of the popu-
l a t i o n fart, so D O N O T B E
A F R A I D ! Ignore M r S i m o n s
heretical advice and break forth.
T h e world lies at your feet (note:
This could also be due to the
'Irish M i s t ' , a strange concoction
produced as a result of a peanut
butter a n d chili sauce diet. It is
often a c c o m p a n i e d by severe
blistering).

Dear Sir
Although reluctant to join the
ranks of letters page contributors
I feel moved to comment on the
' D e f i n i t i v e G u i d e to F a r t i n g '
published in last week's F E L I X .
It was encouraging to find some
a t t e n t i o n b e i n g g i v e n to this
m u c h maligned pastime, but M r
Simon's article put forward only
one of the facets of a rewarding,
t h o u g h m i s u n d e r s t o o d h o b b y .
W h i l e h a v i n g c o m p i l e d a n
excellent treatise on the auditory
variations M r Simons has paid
scant attention to the olfactory
nuances inherant i n the raison
d'etre of the fart.
A c e r t a i n i n d i v i d u a l i t y is
always imparted to the bouquet
by the particular gut flora of the
performer. This enables affici-
anadoes to pinpoint the origin of
a v i r t u o s o r e n d i t i o n w h e n
m o d e s t y o r u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s
prevents the owner claiming it.
T h e r e a r e h o w e v e r s e v e r a l
s u b s t a n c e s w h i c h w i l l l e n d
distinctive reproducible flavours
to one's emissions. M a n y trad-
i t i o n a l beers have t h e i r o w n
recognisable odours for instance,
Wadworths O l d T i m e r , known
as O l d Fart by regulars, which
c a n be i d e n t i f i e d i n m i n u t e
c o n c e n t r a t i o n s t w o h u n d r e d
yards downwind of many W i l t -
shire pubs not to mention the
Anglesea Arms. T h e combina-
tion of the calcium sulphate and
yeast content of Bass found in
many outlets produce an emena-
tion common to many I C stu-
dents. I a m surprised that the
' h i g h ' q u a l i t y of food i n the
College refectories does not cause
more motions to be passed at
U G M s .
W e l l k n o w n a r o m a s ( n o t
necessarily attributable to the
substance after which they are
named) include:
The eggy one: this varety linger
longer than M u r r a y mints.
The cabbagey one: savage! A real
swine. Airwicks the only answer.
The beany one: binds covalently to
the nasal mucosa.
The yeasty one: L D 5 0 really low,
banned by Porton D o w n .
The butter curry: combined with
the burnt ring syndrome and the
dead rat â€” charcoal underpants
a must for this one.
The S B D fart may embody
any one of these but extensive
research has proved the most vile
farts to be those that are heard as
a soft pop followed by a hiss.
A f i n a l c o m f o r t i n g t h o u g h t
attributed by some to D r Samuel
Johnson: N o m a n cannot stand
his o w n farts (or something like
that).

Sir
As residents of Linstead new
block, we were most surprised to
see your front page article in
F E L I X 557 " I m p e r i a l College
D o n accused of being a n u r d ! "
Although we are i n the habit of
displaying messages, the one in
y o u r p h o t o g r a p h has n e v e r
appeared on our windows. Most
of the printed article is fabricated
and has misled many F E L I X
readers. W e would like to stress
again that the photograph is a
forgery and we demand a printed
apology.

Dear Ed
W e went rigid when we saw the
photo; it was like a bolt from the
blue.
W e d i d n ' t realise that the
message had ever existed. H o w -
ever, we k n o w it must have
appeared as F E L I X is such a
t r u t h f u l , h o n e s t , u p s t a n d i n g
organ of the press, and would not
print a pack of filthy lies.
Although we agree you have
the intellect of a cauliflower and
the ability of a mollusc, a short
glans at your articles reveals a
d e p t h h i t h e r t o u n k n o w n i n

field).
Hope you're well

Dear Sir
We are writing against W I S T
being allowed to put on their
p i c k e t o n I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
ground. Both men a n d women
a t t e n d this C o l l e g e a n d b o t h
should be allowed the same rights
and status. Presenting women as
mere pickets is both degrading
a n d i n s u l t i n g to t h e n o r m a l
women at this College (the ones
w h o d o n ' t look like b u s - c o n -
ductors). Mines pointed out last
year. They also pointed out that
a male stripper was ridiculed i n
the event, which would thus not
be viewed as sexist. However,
from an R S M survey previous to
the event, we found out that the
women i n the audience viewed
the female stripper as a bit of a
joke a n d found the male strip-
per's chopper tantalising. W e are
w e l l a w a r e t h a t t h e m e n to
women ratio is rather large (as
are most o f the w o m e n ) b u t
would like to point out that this
p r o b l e m w i l l d i m i n i s h i f I C
doesn't continue to offer services
w h i c h e n h a n c e the image of
women.
W o m e n who cannot cope with
the problem ought to join W I S T
and go picketing at Mines events
and on field trips to Yorkshire.
We agree that men should not
actually have to pay to see a
woman naked; it should be free.
If anyone feels strongly against
the picket they are welcome to
(at) the Mines review on Febru-
ary 27 at 7:30pm.
