Thirds
T h e Thirds feasted on the visual delights of
the gorgeous ladies' hockey team for almost
two hours! This aesthetic dispaly inspired us
to decide that only ten men were needed to
stitch u p s e c o n d - p l a c e d Q M C II. T h i s

purposefully he twice nearly scored again.
T h e game was b e c o m i n g a stroll so we
decided Dave would have to be taken off. A
Q M C defender duly obliged with a tackle
from behind saving us the bother. Even with
nine men the match was too one-sided so K e v
T e a h a n was given the easiest of tap-ins past
D u n c a n B r o w n ( t h e i r f o r w a r d s b e i n g
incapable of scoring). Neil Redmayne then
smashed the most delicate of through balls
past their hopelessly split defence, allowing
Nick Flannagan to take the ball in his stride
and score with a searing left-footer from well
outside the box. In the true spirit of I C fair
play we allowed Q M C to equalise with the
llukiest of headers—after all it would have
been terribly rude lo beat our hosts with only

Bowling
O n Wednesday, February 3, two and a hall
teams set oil for Southampton Bowl to play
the last league of the Southern Division. After
a few mishaps we arrived live minutes late.
Unfortunately without a ladies team we
lost that game before we started. T h e C team
lost their game 3-1. In the first frame they
were beaten by over 100 pins, but lost
narrowly in the second frame by only 20 pins.
T h e star of the team and of the day was Jell'
Q u i n n who got three 169 scores to give him
his first 500+ series the hard way.
T h e B team lost 4-0 and in one game got a
l o w e r score t h a n the C team. T h i s was
generally disappointing as we thought they
might do well with some promising new
players. T h e A team through good teamwork
won 3-1 and only lost their last game by
about 20 pins.

Firsts
I Imperial made a somewhat tentative start
against a full strength St Thomas' team.
After twenty minutes Tommies caught the I C
defence a d m i r i n g I a n D r i v e r s thighs by
converting a free hit from the top of the D .
W i t h thoughts of last year's close match, I C
were soon another goal behind. The Imperial
defence hung on and with a minute remain-
ing Bell and (/arms tangled well on the
break and G a r m s drilled the ball home
from the widest of angles. Thus a shocked
I m p e r i a l side went into the second hall
p u t t i n g he o p p o s i t i o n u n d e r r e m a r k a b l e
pressure. T h e n a n e n t i r e l y u n p r o v o k e d
incident between Franklin and the centre
forward saw the latter receiving a yellow card
and within a minute Imperial were 1-3 down.
W i t h St Thomas and Imperial both thinking
the game was over, Bateson proceeded to
score 2 spectacular goals. St Thomas pressed
hard for the remainder of the second half but
the defence coped well with Drivers six iron
clip shots and R. Dodds runs.
T h e first half of extra time saw St Thomas
continuing where they left oil with both Riley
and in the second half, Coatesworth making
stops on the line. But with five minutes
remaining, just as Riley was pondering on
the technicalities ol p-llick taking, St Thomas
scored.
T e a m : Slatter, Coatesworth, Riley, Parker,
Ay res, Rao, Franklin, Bateson, Garms, Bell

C o n t i n u i n g o u r t r e m e n d o u s f o r m we
completed our third successive annihilation
of the season. This week our unfortunate
opponents were Q M C w h o were e i t h e r
completely useless or simply stunned by our
skill.
T h e fact that we only had nine players and
no goalie did little to deter us and good
(lowing play throughout the team produced
some excellent chances. We could have had
at least a dozen and probably would have
done but for some fine saves from their
goalie and some slightly oil target shooting
from us ( p a r t i c u l a r l y the halves). O n e
