CLUBS AND SOCIETIES-
PhotoSoc
As those of you who have read our newsletter will know, we have arrangec
two lectures and two competitions for the end of this month and the
beginning of next. T h e r e are, however, s o m e alterations to the
programme. Firstly, the lecture on M a r c h 2 entitled "The rise and fall of
the plate camera' by Martin Russell, will start at 7:30pm and not 6:30pm as
stated. M r Russell will be bringing a van-load of historical plate cameras
with him, and if you have an old camera you would like to bring along he
will give an expert opinion on it. Entrance is free, but come early, as the
theatre (Mines 3-03) is not very large and M r Roussell is an extremely
popular lecturer.
Secondly, M r A . J . Wilkinson F R I C S , who was to be judging the
coloure competition on M a r c h 16, is unable to come. W e will be trying to
find another judge, further details will be given nearer the time.
Finally, don't forget that our first event is a black a n d white
competition, to be judged by M r G.D. Harpman, on February 23 at
6:30pm in Mines 3-03. The entry fee is 20p per print, and photos should
be not less than 5"x7" and need not be mounted.

T h e r e c o m e s a time i n every
man's (and woman's) life when he
(or she) has to face up to certain
undeniable . truths. Fortunately,
this time has, for me at least, not
yet arrived, so here is a bulletin
instead. A new S F magazine has
c o m e i n t o e x i s t a n c e a n d its
British. It's called Extro and issue
one is rather good. If it continues
at that standard it will be worth
ordering. I have no information
about the other new magazine,
Interzone. Have you ever won-
dered why biblical fundamentalists
don't think the earth is flat? What
freemasonry is all about? H o w
Nigel Calder persuades the B B C
to film the scripts he sends them?

make a better Prime Minister than
Margaret Thatcher? What are the
Protocols of the Elders of Britain?
D o you know what Merovigian
means? All these questions are
l i n k e d . I r e m e m b e r l a u g h i n g
yesterday but I can't remember
what at. Does anyone think they
can write funny bulletins for S F
Soc? Do you thank Gary Trudeau
w o u l d a c c e p t t h e j o b ? Y e s ,
question marks can be fun, but
when were they invented? Some-
body call the A A : I'm about to
have a breakdown.

The Great Thames Barrier was

AudioSoc
M y sincerest apologies come along with a whole string of them from M r
Mike Daniels and he is very sorry for not being able to come along and
lecture to all you lovely afficianados but the Audio T / A T LabsShow
came first as I am sure you will understand. Maybe next time, eh? N o w
dry your eyes and after having sighed a silent sigh, read on....
Roll up, roll up, rollup; hear the bestest lecture you'se ever did
hear—Hallelujah life is anew. Although he is Australian (and they did
bring Fosters along with the Aborigne and the hopping kangaroo), Max
Townshend is a great personality and an amazing electrical engineer to
boot. How could you possibly miss this one?
Elite Electronics will conjure up mental facsimiles of small black boxes
with knobs on, sticky mat turntables with no knobs on and very good
sound quality. Well, M a x is the Managing Director of this company and
he has promised to come in and give us a lecture on some of the ideas he
had used in developing his audio system. This he has promised to do on
Monday, February 15, at 6:30pm in the Quiet Room, QR002, Sherfield
Building. So support your neighbourhood Spiderman and come along. I
vow that you will enjoy yourselves. Bring a friend, dog or bottle.
Just as an extra incentive (and someone else did this) Raymond Cook,
Managing Director of K.E.T. Loudspeakers is at Imperial College the
next day, Tuesday, February 16 at 6:00pm in Room 6.20, Royal School of
M i n e s Building. H i s lecture is entitled " T h e Development of the
Loudspeaker". H e is a very educated gentleman—witness the number of
times his product gets on Tomorrow's World.
