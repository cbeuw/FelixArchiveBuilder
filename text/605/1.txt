False start
to elections
I C U H O N O R A R Y S E C R E T A R Y M a r c o Ledwold hat made his first
mistake' in the sabhalioal election run-up.
As announced in F E L I X a n d included on this term's calendar,
papers for tin- sabbatical posts of President. Deputy President,
Honor.in Secretary and F E L I X Editor, were originally intended to go
up yesterday.
However, M r L c d w o l d discovered on Thursday morning that,
according to die bye-laws, he was not required lo put papers up until
15 College days belore the elections. Hence papers will be put up on
M o n d a y . February 15. instead.
He explained his mistake by saving that the F E L I X Editor had
pestered him lor dales at the beginning of this term lor the F E L I X
Calendar and that he had mistakenly rushed. Instead of counting 15
days before the elections, lie counted from the Hustings U G M .
Elections for the lour sabbatical positions will be by campus wide
ballot in all departments on M o n d a y . M a r c h 8 and Tuesday, March 9.
The Rector, Lord Flowers, has agreed to give College backmfi
to a charitable venture to send food and medical supplies to
Poland.
A group called Supplies to Poland (STP) was formed at IC follow ing
M r C o l i n Cooper's letter in F E L I X G03 appealing for help. The S i !
group has been meeting regularly over the past two weeks and wilt
have a large meeting today at 12:45pm in the U n i o n D i n i n g Hall.
Their intention is to collect vital supplies for Poland and transport
them via sea and road over the Easter vacation. The group has already
gained support from organisations i n the British Isles a n d arc
particularly pleased that the College is allowing them facilities lor a
temporary base.
The Rector stressed that the College gave its support only if it was
clear that this would be a totally charitable and non-political venltire.
He stressed that the group would have lo "keep their noses clean
the College eotild obviously not support a polilicial stance.
Three routes to Poland have been considered a n d are ciirieiilc
being rusted. A n announcement will be made about the viability of the
project on February 20.
One of the moving forces behind S'TP, M r Nicholas Gardni

further help. The group need more people to act as both crew
support. Secretaries would be helpful during the preparations a n
