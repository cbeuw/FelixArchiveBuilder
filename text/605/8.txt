Graffiti
F o r t h o s e w h o d o n ' t k n o w ,
Graffitti m e m b e r s are strange
p e o p l e w h o r e v e l in a r t i s t i c
activity. Perhaps more accurately
we attempt to produce screen-
p r i n t e d p o s t e r s , T - s h i r t s a n d
v a r i o u s o t h e r t h i n g s . W e are
prepared to print almost anything.
A lot of our work involves printing
p o s t e r s for o t h e r c l u b s a n d
societies. So, if you're a publicity
officer bored with F E L I X printing,
come and see us. We usually need
a couple of weeks notice because
all printing is done in spare time.
We can be found, about half-way
up the West Staircase (opposite
side to Union Office) of the Union
Building behind the G y m . There is
always someone there on Wednes-
day afternoons or alternatively
contact us throught department
letter-racks.
We have recently bought an
airbrush which will be available to
members when they have been
shown how to use it properly.
Demonstrations will be held on
Wednesdays and must be attended
by anyone who wants to use it.

well-earned, victory over Jennings

pains with S T O I C (the most fun you can have with your clothes on)

TifiZ/arion
Here's some questions the everyday student about College asks about
S T O I C .
O r g y
Q: What has a network of ten television sets and is expanding? (Clue: not
IC Radio).
Q: Does S T O I C Really have a Quantel Special Effects Generator costing
millions of pounds?
Q: Has S T O I C overspent on its budget?
Q: What is S T O I C ?
Incest
If you are remotely interested in the answers to the above or you know
how to switch on a television, S T O I C needs your technical expertise.
(Perhaps you only want to interview your favourite sex symbol.)
Carnal Pleasure
Whatever your interest in television, why no: come along to the T V
Studio (Elec Eng) at any time and meet some sincere, friendly people.
(See our illustrious Chairman, Lawrence, as well.)
H o w are we going to disarm?
T h r o u g h the p r o c e s s of o u r
Parliamentary democracy? If this
is to be the case it can only occur
through a change of government.
C o m e a l o n g to M a t h s 213 at
1:00pm on Thursday, February
18, and listen to Frank Allaun, M P
outline the Labour Party's case.
They have made many promising
s t a t e m e n t s , but w o u l d t h e y
produce the goods if they got into
power?—Remember which gov-
ernment authorised the upgrading
of P o l a r i s in the C h e v a l i n e
programme.
For your information on Satur-
day, February 13, IC is playing
host to a 'Professions against the
B o m b " c o n f e r e n c e ( m e d i c s ,
journalists, scientists, that sort of
thing). It's interesting to think that
many people attack C N D for
b e i n g g e n e r a l l y left-wing a n d
idealist, yet much of our strongest
support comes from some of the
most " r e s p e c t a b l e " groups in
society.
Scout
and Guide
Last Thursday's regular lunchtime
m e e t i n g i n c l u d e d a t a l k o n
climbing in the Alps. O u r fort-
n i g h t l y w e e k e n d t r i p was to
S n o w d o n i a last w e e k e n d . W e
stayed in a comfortable hut in the
Ogywn Valley and went climbing
on T r y f a r and w a l k i n g on the
G l y d e r s on S a t u r d a y . B e t t e r
weather on Sunday encouraged ail
of us to go for an interesting
traverse of the Carnedd group of
p e a k s . F i n e w e a t h e r gave us
b r e a t h t a k i n g views of most of
Snowdonia. After a meal at the
hut we returned to College.
Yesterday's meeting was a trip
up the Queen's Tower to yet
a n o t h e r i n t e r e s t i n g v i e w of
London's skyline. Next week's
regular meeting will be a talk on
Photography by an expert from
the R C A , in Mines 303 at 12:30pm.
T h e n e x t w e e k e n d trip is on
February 19 to 21 and is a service
project at the N a ' i n a l Scout
b o a t i n g c e n t r e in '. i a r l o w - o n -
Thames.
For further details of all events
see us at "Butties" in the South
side Upper Lounge above the bar
every lunchtime.
Soc Soc
O n Tuesday, February 16, there
will be representatives present
f r o m ' W o m e n f o r L i f e ' a n d
Women's Voice speaking on the
subject of abortion. The discussion
will t a k e place in the G r e e n
Committee Room at the top of the
Union Building at 6:30pm. All are
welcome.
Secondly this term's 'Radical' is
under p r e p a r a t i o n (Soc S o c ' s
newspaper). If you feel the urge to
write something on any aspect of
socialism (related to IC or just
socialism in general), send it to Ian
House, Life Sci 1.
Finally, don't forget our book-
store in the J C R , Friday lunch-
times. We're always ready for an
argument, so see you there.
Wing Chun
N o doubt if you've been reading
our previous articles in F E L I X
you'll be well aware of the history
and traditions of Wing Chun, so I
won't bore you all again. Instead
I'll try to give you a small idea
about the non-physical side of the
art.
Wing C h u n places great em-
phasis on the training of the mind
for without the right attitude one
c a n n o t t r a i n t h e b o d y . T h e
student is encouraged to find his
o w n way t h r o u g h the art, to
question and criticize techniques
before he accepts them, until he
feels confident that the techniques
will help him when the need arises.
The instructor's job is to guide the
s t u d e n t t h r o u g h the v a r i o u s
stages, to help him realize his
m i s t a k e s a n d h o w to c o r r e c t
them. Hence training is carried
out in a r e l a x e d a t m o s p h e r e
a l l o w i n g the s t u d e n t to t h i n k
a b o u t t e c h n i q u e s i n s t e a d of
blindly accepting them.
In writing this article I can only
give you a small idea about Wing
Chun, so if you would like to know
more, don't by shy, we are always
glad to have new members and
before I forget: we meet in the
Union G y m on Wednesday after-
noons, 3:00pm and on Saturday
mornings at 9:30am.
