Without collapsible captain Sieve Hell, the
2nd X V was once again up lo lull strength,
a n d a l t e r t h e u s u a l t e d i o u s t r a n s p o r t
problems, arrived al the City of London
P o y t e c h n i c s g r o u n d s o m e w h e r e n e a r
Istanbul.
Skilful contortions in a (hanging room
only just b i g enough to hold G a r y Pike's
attache case enabled the kick off to take place-
j u s t before sunset, a n d t h e t e a m soon
managed to gain its sea legs on a pitch that
was about as smooth as M a t t Smith's skin.
T h e first h a l f d o w n h i l l w i t h the tide
showed the usual mixture of the average,
above average and plain ridiculous, but we
scored a few and they didn't so there!
The half-time pep talk lacked Hell-like
cursing but Perv's leg-zil equalled Erika Roe
entertainment standards.
Despite continued hall handling problems
(no. not that sort) and the ever increasing
gradient, the second half saw more tries IC's
way, more agony Gary's way, more punches
Steve K i r b y ' s way and more desperate cries
of "pass i t ! " Miles Thompson's way, leaving
the final score at 29-0. Points were scored by
O w e n ( N o d d y , t h e s m a l l e s t p o s e r i n
Toytown), Miles (2 tries). N i c B r u m m e l l (2
tries) and M a r k " D e a d E y e " Hudson (1 try.
1 penalty, 2 conversions).

IC Water Polo C l u b coasted to an easy win
against St M a r y ' s Hospital i n their second
L o n d o n University League game.
Most of our effort went into the first two
quarters, when some aggressive play from
Casini (3 goals) and Heffernan (1 goal), and
some good saves by Burnett in goal, gave us a
commanding lead. The last two quarters saw
some mindless play, notably from Last and
Leach, who each missed easy goals, and from
Burnett, who watched in fascination as a shot
from the half-way line sailed past him into
the back of the net. However, a goal from
Ashwin in the last quarter took us to a
respectable 5-1 result.

opposition that the country could offer and
managed to beat all the double sculls as well.
The senior C magic I V was robbed of
certain victory, despite a new go-faster coat
of paint, when it had its rudder ripped out by

Quite a successful day in high cross winds

H a v i n g defeated Tottenham earlier in the
season the I C team made their way to N o r t h
London confident of winning this vital top of
the table clash. N o t even the brick which
came Hying through the window was going to
stop them. So despite having a previously
untried penetration system, I C built up a
winning lead in the first set only to finally let
it slip 13-15. A s a result it was decided to
simplify things a little which resulted in
Imperial raving away to take the set 15-4.
The third set proved to be a real cliff-hanger*
but I C hung on to take it 15-12, and with it
Tottenham's hopes of w i n n i n g as after this
the Tottenham team just crumbled leaving
Imperial to take the final set 15-4. I C ' s
victory over their nearest rivals was very well
deserved c o n s i d e r i n g it was a c h i e v e d i n
difficult conditions (the back of the court was
only a couple of inches from the gym wall
w h i c h made s e r v i n g i n p a r t i c u l a r very
difficult for players not used to such cramped
conditions) and now gives them an excellent
chance of winning the league.

H i there readers! Incredibly the team got it
together this week and won. Shock! Horror!
(Our shock, their horror!). It's amazing how
much faster 'and drier, i l can be if you keep
the boat the right way up 'have to try it more
often, eh. Graham,,! W e didn't even break
a n y b o a t s w h i c h w a s n o m i n o r feet
considering last week's orgy of destruction.
In the first race G r a h a m a n d R i c h a r d
m ^ p a n excellent start from a heavily port
biased line a n d lead posed, a l l the way
round. T w o enemy boats, under pressure
from Pat and M i k e , collided at the windward
mark and one of these capsized five minutes
later rounding the wing mark. Julian and
J i m showed great potential in a dra<*n out
rearguard action against the last Surrey boat.
^"he second race started with Surrey's
captain watching from a grandstand seat on
his upturned boat. H e had opted for a L c
M a n s start but, at the c r u c i a l m o m e n t ,
discovered that his walking o n water act
needed a little more practise. Kennedy and
M i l l s had a great time laying into one of the
opposition's boats, and knocked it down lo
t h i r d . M e a n w h i l e J u l i a n a n d J i m h a d
rejoined battle with 'Crushed C a n a r y ' and
finished their own vendetta on top.
W e finished 1, 2; 4 in both races to win I he
match 2-0 (137,pts-30pts).
Team: G. Kennedy and R. Tostavin, P. Mill-,
and M. Younghusband, J. Bennett and J. Redman.

" W h a t do you make of it Holmes?"
"Difficult to say old chap, all those lads
hanging that white thing about, they must be
making themselves rather tired."
"Fascinating. I really don't know how you
do it Holmes. Some sort of punishment do
you think?"
" A distinct possibility Watson, that young
lady on the sideline is certainly screaming
quite a lot. In fact, I would go as far as to say
that we have a dour midlield struggle on our
hands here."
^'Absolutely amazing. A n y t h i n g we can do
about it?"
" I ' m afraid not, although that S i m o n
Witter chappie is playing very well, he may
be able to do something."
" H o w right you are Holmes. T e l l me, do
those chaps in between the white posts ever
join in.'' They look damn cold to me."
'•"Occasionally Watson, see one o f them is
bringing up the half-time refreshments, in a

"Marvellous Holmes. D o you think we'll
see any improvement?"
" I would very much doubt it, although
that S i m o n G r a y is o b v i o u s l y t r y i n g to
change the game to fisticuffs."
?"Wonderful Holmes, anything to relieve
the boredom."
