Following last week's editorial, three
articles have been received on elections...
Reversing the
trend
by J Martin Taylor
The last two years have seen a sad decline in
the ability of the Union to have any real effort
on events in C o l l e g e . O f course we are
consulted and sometimes even listened to, but
all too often we are ignored. The reason for
this is the deliberate policy of 'co-operation' of
the last two years.
John Passmore, who it is clear in retrospect
was out of his depth as President, was elected
pledging to increase co-operation with College
after the more confrontation-type policies of
t h e p r e v i o u s t w o P r e s i d e n t s , M a r y
Attenborough and Chris Fox. This, together
with the fact that J o h n P a s s m o r e m a k e s '
Barney M c C a b e appear industrious, has led to
the state of affairs we now see, where 'anything
for a quiet life' seems to have become the
Presidential role. Nick Morton, although very
likeable and well intentioned, has failed to
reverse this. I'm sure he gets on very well with
the Rector, M r Mooney, etc. H e should do,
because he rarely, if ever, causes them any
problems. Hence the 'quiet life' approach has
spread to the College authorities, who have
consequently slipped into a comfortable
complacency.
I s h o u l d point out here that I a m not
suggesting that we should hold occupations or
take other forms of disruptive action, except
as a last resort. But the Union has been sadly
lacking any firm, decisive leadership over the
last two years. Co-operation has gone too far
when 'the Rector and the President of the
Students' Union decided' on a mid-session
r e n t i n c r e a s e (to q u o t e f r o m S t u d e n t
Residence C o m m i t t e e minutes) in direct
contradiction of U n i o n policy. T h e n N i c k
Morton says he didn't consider a rent strike
because 'nobody proposed one'. Frightened of
annoying the Rector, Nick? In the words of
Mark Smith, if we can't rely on the President to
lead, then who will?
In these increasingly difficult times the
Union needs strong leadership, which means
not being afraid ot annoying or criticizing
College 'dignitaries' when they deserve it. It
means standing up for students' interests and
not adopting the laissez-faire attitudes seen
over the last two years. It means leading in a
definite direction, rather than attempting to
drift with the tide and please all of the people
all of the time, which is only possible if you do
n o t h i n g (as N i c k M o r t o n is b e l a t e d l y
discovering).
In short: co-operation, yes; but when it
r e a c h e s the e x t e n t of a c q u i e s c e n c e to
everything College comes up with, then it has
gone too far. The Union has become little
more than a branch of the College administra-
tion when more than ever it needs to be
fighting the students' corner. This trend must
be r e v e r s e d n o w . C o m e b a c k M a r y
Attenborough and Chris Fox, all is forgiven!
1982 Presidential
Election
by Andrew Lyall
It cannot have escaped the notice of any
student who has been at IC for more than a
year and quite possibly many of those who
arrived at the beginning of this year that I C U is
a fast declining institution held in contempt by
many of its ordinary members. This is a tragic
thing to have happened to the instrument that
represents the students of one of the most
important academic institutions in the world.
Traditionally the sabbatical Union Officers
s t r e n u o u s l y b l a m e this on the o r d i n a r y
members, who they say are boring, apathetic
and not interested in the Union. What amazes
me is that after pathetic exhibitions like the last
U G M they should be at all surprised by the
non-interest. I have been at IC now for five
years and my own experience does not tally
with this commonly held view. The old joke
about boring scientists and engineers is simply
not true. One only needs to look at the many
very active clubs and societies and the large
number of events that take place every week
to realise that IC is overflowing with interesting
and intelligent people.
N o the truth is very far from this. The
problem lies in the fact that in recent years the
Union has been represented by the very small
minority of students at IC who are boring.
Those people who view the Union as a vehicle
for cosseting their own egos and providing
them with a glass of sherry when something
Effective
leadership
by Stephen Goulder
The most important single factor effecting I C U
next year will be the increase in its grant. This
increase will be not more than 5%, which is well
short of the rate of inflation. This is arguably
fair since College itself is having to sustain a
cut of 20% in its expenditure over the next
three years.
In view of this any changes made under the
regime of the next I C U President must be cost
effective. A l l the election pledges of the
prospective candidates must be seen in this
light. For example we can only bring the Union
Refectory under Union control if it is going to
generate a profit in the short and medium
term. I have used this example because it is the
pledge most often made but (as usual) never
kept, indeed accurate costings of the Union
Refectory have never been made by the
Union. This is one good reason to treat every
election candidate with healthy scepticism.
T h i s n e e d for a n a p p r e c i a t i o n of the
economic climate is most obvious in the antics
of M r Nick Morton and the Bar Committee.
His committee apparently intends to have a
bust of Prince Albert in the Southside Bar in
addition to a coloured print of Prince Albert's
coat of arms and various Victorian prints at a
cost of £750. T h i s is utter waste and an
extravagance that any President should have
stopped immediately.
T h e r e is also inefficiency in the U n i o n
administration itself which must be cut. In
particular Union Finance Committee must
have a more effective policy governing the
expenses that most clubs have in common. In
upsets them. They may well be nice people—in
fact having known almost all of them I know
this to be so, but they have not been leaders,
and worse they have not been interested in
the membership. In my view there is a wealth
of talent and potential interest and involvement
present among the membership waiting for a
suitable President to be elected.
The normal procedure for electing a Union
President relies on candidates who have been
"brought up through the ranks" in the Union
way of thinking and after the votes have been
counted they take a single step sideways and
sit d o w n in the P r e s i d e n t i a l chair. T h e s e
people are easily recognizable and 1 urge you
not to vote for t h e m as they are totally
unsuited for the position of President.
This is going to be a very important year for
students at IC. The I C / Q E C merger is still
lurking in the background and the student
grant has received a substantial cut in real
terms. The British education system has a
history of political tinkering and it is important
that the elected representatives of I C U should
resist any attempt to break the mould of the
Brit'sh education system against the interest of
the universities and students concerned. This
issue of merges is a far wider one and effects
not only I C / Q E C students. Have you heard of
the Bedford/Birkbeck merge for example?
Back at College a private caterer has at last
broken the Mooney monopoly and discussions
about an N U S referendum are starting again.
A lot of important decisions are going to
have to be made this coming year and it is of
vital importance to elect a President who is not
going to let himself be pushed around and is
dedicated to making the Union effectual and
more relevant to its members.
particular laying down norms for publicity and
speakers expenses. They have already taken
steps to effectively put the clubs that need to
buy large items of equipment onto five year
plans (hence spreading the load over five
years). This must be carried on by next year's
Executive.
In the fields of A c a d e m i c A f f a i r s a n d
External Affairs the President plays a leading
role. Again it is the expenditure cuts that
govern the range of problems that will crop up.
We must fight to keep a firm commitment to
teaching in all departments rather than let it be
sacrificed to save current research. The public
spending cuts generally mean that we are
w i t n e s s i n g a r a t i o n a l i z a t i o n of L o n d o n
University as a whole. Thus to be an effective
voice next year we must have an integrated
response from the student unions of London
University.
I hope it is apparent that next session we

w o r k s . U n i n f o r m e d election pledges can
seldom be implemented.
It is clear that the Union has lost its direction
over the last two years. This has occured
because the sabbaticals have failed to relate to
many students and have been content to wait
in the Union Bar for the masses to come to
them. But perhaps the most fatal error made
by M r Morton and M r Passmore is that they
assumed that by sitting on committees they
were actually being effective. They were in fact
becoming ever more isolated in the Union
Office never making any real effort to talk to
o r d i n a r y students. T h e y thus e x c h a n g e d
relevant feedback for hackist sycophancy.
Thus I urge you to vote for a candidate who
is at least partly experienced in Union affairs,
willing to argue the Union cause effectively,
and most importantly willing to get out of his
office and meet students around College.
