Accommodation for next year
Technical problems have once more reared
their ugly head, but 1 think that F E L I X should
have reached you on time.
However, this week an eight page supplement
on C o l l e g e a c c o m m o d a t i o n w h i c h w a s to
have been included has had to be dropped
until next week. A l l the artwork is ready and
waiting, but because the offset-litho machine
broke down on Wednesday there has just not
been time to print it.
This supplement will be included next week
and (for those really keen to find out about
Halls, Houses, etc., for next year) some copies
will be available in the Student Services Offices
from Tuesday onwards.
Welfare Week
I hope you all turn up to the events organised
for next week (see centre pages). I'm glad Nick
Pyne, I C U Welfare Officer, has chosen a fairly
light hearted approach (just read some of the
articles!) and I think Welfare Week could be
very entertaining as well as informative.
Mind you I'm getting a bit tired of all these
"weeks". I think people who organise events
should try to avoid packaging a few random
l e c t u r e s t o g e t h e r a n d l a b e l l i n g t h e m
S i l l y t w a t s w h o g e t r i g h t u p m y n o s e W e e k or
whatever. The only effect of doing so is to
draw attention away from their own and other
(possibly more general and important) causes
like student welfare.

If you are reading this on Friday morning

get it to you.
Finally a thank-you to Nick Pyne for helping
so much on his welfare spread and to Eric

Wodge was invited to a wine and cheese party
in the maths faculty last week, which was
attended by the usual mixture of pure and
applied mathematicians. For those who are
new to this column, I should point out that pure
mathematicians are perfectly truthful, whereas
applied mathematicians invariably lie, and
Wodge amused himself by letting each of the
ten people present make one statement about
the o t h e r s , a n d t h e n w o r k i n g out w h o
belonged to which department.
Len was the first to talk to Wodge. "If the
head of department is applied," he said "then
Michael is pure, but Nick is applied." " O n the
other h a n d , " put i n O l i v e r , " t h e head of
department is pure if and only if Peter is
applied and Quentin is pure." " D i d I hear you
mention Peter?" asked Richard. "If he and I are
both applied then Michael isn't, but if either of
us isn't, then he is." "If you want to know
about Michael, I'd have a few words with
Stephen," said Nick. " Y o u can believe at least
one of t h e m . " " D i d I hear y o u m e n t i o n
Stephen?" asked Quentin. "He's friendly with
Len and Oliver, and at least one of the three is
applied." " H o w can you mistrust Oliver?"
exclaimed Michael. "He's as truthful as I a m ! "
"If I'm a pure mathematician," said Tony,
" t h e n S t e p h e n , L e n a n d t h e h e a d of
department are not all applied."
"Having trouble?" asked Peter helpfully. "If
in doubt, guess pure, since over half of us are
truthful." " O n the contrary," said Stephen.
" O v e r half of us are untruthful."
Having elicited one statement each from nine
of the ten present, Wodge went over to talk to
the head of the department. Unfortunately
he was rather the worse for wine, and Wodge
couldn't get anything coherent out of him at
all. N o t that it mattered, of course, since he
had already deduced that who is what?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office please. There is a prize of £5
(donated by Mend-a-Bike) for the correct
solution randomly selected at 1:00pm on
Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
Seven triangles or six neighbours, according to
taste. There must be a line from the obtuse
angle, dividing it into two. A n d the line cannot
continue straight through to the long side, or
else another obtuse-angled triangle is formed,
and you have to start again. S o there must be
an internal node, and there must be at least
five lines leading from it, or else one of them
must be greater than or equal to a right angle.
Chris Brannick, Maths 1, was selected from
the eleven who got it right.

something difficult; see what you make of this
week's. G o o d luck!
