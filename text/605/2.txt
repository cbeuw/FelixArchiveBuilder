Sir
Your c.onimeiiis about me
in last week's F E L I X editorial
must set some sort of record
low for this newspaper; i n
terms not only of accuracy,
responsibility, and fairness,
but also the abuse of the
supposedly unbiased position
the editor of a students (or
any other) newspaper should
occupy,
'The assertion that 1 am to
stand as a candidate for I C U
President is clearly in error, as
your vaunted "news" report-
ers w o u l d have discovered
had they explored further
afield from the F E L I X Office
than the U n i o n Bar or the
B o t / Z o o C o m m o n R o o m ,
had they found time off front
watching free film previews in
the West E n d , or from writing
fatuous swimming articles. In
fact, a trip only as far as the
Guilds U n i o n Oft ice to consult
with Sue Hartley or Frank
Rowscll would have confirm-
ed that I have no intention of
cont esting the job of I C U Pres-
ident. Surely too, if you had
bothered to personally arrive
on time at IC 1J U G M s , or
a t t e n d I C U C o u n c i l , y o u
would have observed that I
h a v e p r o p o s e d o n l y o n e
motion at Council (censuring
Barney) and have not spoken
to a motion at a U G M , nor
indeed have I been a parti-
c u l a r l y f r e q u e n t c o r r e s -
pondent i n these columns.
S o m e b o d y f r a n t i c a l l y elec-
tioneering would, I believe,
have been more zealous i n
publicising his name, face and
opinions than I have this year.
Y o u continued your tirade
with an analysis of my politi-
cal opinions, describing me as
a wet Tory, about the only
remotely accurate part of the
editorial. 1 do not. however,
b e l i e v e that a p o l i t i c a l l y
moderate stance, like the one
I r e c e n t l y t o o k at I ' l l '
attacking the P C L "riot in the
streets" brand of occupation
(something of general student
interest you failed to report at
any time during the weeks the
occupation lasted) necessarily
implies that as I C l " President
I would have been a doormat
for the Rector to walk all
over. 1 partieularh resent the
u n s u b s t a n t i a t e d allegation
t h a t I w o u l d u n d e r any
circumstances sell I C students
down the river, and I would
be pleased if you would cite
e x a m p l e s o f m y supposed
insincerity.
T h e p o i n t a b o u t y o u r
failure to report the P C L riots
I mentioned above may also
have some bearing on your
production of a F E L I X wilh
two thirds of its front page
devoted to a non-news story.
In a week when Kings derided
to stay out of the N U S , when
the papers for student posts on
the University Senate went
up, and when the U L Subject
A r e a R e v i e w C o m m i t t e e s
(very important for the future
of the University as a whole)
reported, I believe your James
Deeny article was an insult to
the intelligence of students at
I C . S a d l y t h o u g h , s u c h
insularity is t y p i c a l of t he
xenophobic hatred of any-
thing outside this bit of SW7
which characterises so many
F E L I X Editors. Indeed it is
probably my continued inter-
est in U L U and consideration
of a p o s s i b l e s a b b a t i c a l
election campaign there, on
issues y o u p r o b a b l y won't
have heard of, let alone care
a b o u t o r u n d e r s t a n d that
c a u s e d y o u to w r i t e t h e
editorial you did.
In c o n c l u s i o n , as E d i t o r
you have a responsibley to
earn your sabbatical salary by
publishing a paper containing
news, informed comment and
objective reporting, very little
of which was contained in last
week's F E L I X . Y o u also
p r e s u m a b l y b e l i e v e y o u r
position gives you a good, in
depth, knowledge of at least
I his s t u d e n t s ' u n i o n : y o u r
f a i l u r e , l i k e that o f y o u r
mentor and immediate pre-
decessor, to print constructive
criticism ol'l'nion and College
officials' actions, as opposed
to easv "knocking copy" gives
the lie to that too.

Dear Mr Smith
I wish lo condemn in no
uncertain terms your editorial
regarding M r Chris Webb. It
is one of the most vicious
personal attacks that I have
read on anybody in F E L I X in
recent \ ears (and that includes
those made on Capt Lindley).
M r Webb, who proposed me
a couple of years ago for H o n
Sec. is one of flie most able
politicians in this College and
due to this he has over the
y e a r s h a d s u f f i c i e n t l y a
pluralistic attitude to take
part i n affairs beyond the
walls of this College.
There is nothing wrong in
being a wet tory and as one of
our former Prime Ministers
(Edward Heath) has pointed
out there is every possibility of
wet lories and social demo-
crats working together.
I therefore think that you
should publish a full retraction
of your totally unwarranted
attack on M r Webb.

PS: I assume that a l l the
publicity rules for this coming
election have been torn up
(not only by yourself 1 might
add).
Sir
I am writing to condemn
your attack on Chris Webb in
y o u r e d i t o r i a l last week.
Attacks on myself are fair as 1
am elected to a " p u b l i c "
position and should expect
public, criticism. Your critic-
isms of me this year have been
a little uninspired, but more
of that in later weeks. Attacks
on m y predecessor, J o h n
Passmore, are irrelevant to a
significant section of your
r e a d e r s h i p , b u t a g a i n e x -
pected as he has held the
senior post in I C U . (Inciden-
tally, John's apparent laziness
may be attributable to the
way your predecessor wrecked
his m o t i v a t i o n ) . H o w e v e r ,
attacks on a potential presi-
dential candidate are com-
pletely out of order and could
cause irreparable damage to a
' campaign.
As Chris will not (actually
cannot thanks to your editor-
ial) now stand for I he post of
I C l I President, 1 am able to
go on record as saying, with
due respect to other potential
candidates, that 1 think Chris
would have been the best man
for the job.
Chris is an excellent orator
and has w o i ked h a r d for
students (at IC and elsewhere)
in the past. Sincerity is a word
I would use in describing him.
T o slate Chris is political and
ambitious is hardly to insult
him. His politics do not agree
with mine, but I know Chris
has a genuine concern f o r I he
way any government's policies
affect studentsâ€”an awareness
many students here would be
advised to develop.
I suspect vou wrote your
editorial in the belief that
Chris would not stand for
I C l * P r e s i d e n t . I w o u l d
question the reliability of your
s o u r c e o f i n f o r m a t i o n i n
forming that belief ami ask
you if you had contemplated
the possibility Chris might
change his mind over the next
few weeks. W h i l s t a p p r e -
ciating your desire for a lively
and informed election cam-
paign, I believe you could
have prevented an excellent
candidate from running for
President.
II is possible Chris Webb
m a y d e c i d e to r u n for a
University of London sab-
batical post. If he does, I hope
many I C students will offer
support to a sincere a n d
articulate candidate.
Tours faithfully

President, I C U
Dear Sir
1 was dismayed on Friday
morning to read in F E L I X
that my colleague and fellow
degenerate, M r James Deeny,
had supposedly e m b a r k e d
upon a keep-fit campaign.
Could this be, 1 wondered,
the same James Deeny I had
seen that very morning at
Gloucester Road wandering
haphazardly towards the tail
end of a 9:30 lecture amidst a
m i a s m a of foul, cancerous
fumes being emitted from a
cigarette clenched between
his d e c a y i n g t e e t h , a n d
nursing the brain-numbing
r e s u l t s o f t h e p r e v i o u s
evening's alcoholic excesses?
Tours sincerely
