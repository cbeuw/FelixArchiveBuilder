FELIX
VIEWPOINT
On t h i s page we hope to p r i n t , from time to time,
a r t i c l e s on controversial topics and matters of gen-
e r a l interest. Contributors willbe given a carte
blanche and the Editor, therefore, accepts no res-
p o n s i b i l i t y f o r the views expressed. The f i r s t of
these a r t i c l e s concerns the new london newspaper,
"University".
P A P E R U N I V E R S I T Y
The great cry of despair, which i n c i d e n t a l l y has
l a t e l y acquired a hint of the same monotony as the
bleating of many sheep, that students at t h i s College
have no university l i f e misses one s i g n i f i c a n t fact.
London i s not a suitable home f o r a university.
With the world's greatest c i t y to explore, why
blame the students who refuses to give up time to or-
ganise dances f o r those who have to be cajoled by Jub-
l i c i t y into dancing? Why blame him f o r refusing to
play rugger or row f o r a college which w i l l support
him only i f mascots be jeopardized on touch l i n e or
tow-path? What student i n h i s senses w i l l pay/a bob
to see h i s companions' endeavours to act when the Hew
Theatre offers him the finest i n the land f o r one and
six?
I f we i n I.C. have tended to miss the obvious,
s i s t e r colleges have shown themselves even l e s s per-
ceptive. Recently a f o r t n i g h t l y publication has em-
erged from U.C's P i . o f f i c e , the intent of which i s
c l e a r l y to promote a "University of London S p i r i t " .
As a solemn seal to these intentions the paper i s c a l -
led "The University".
So f a r two 4-page editions of "The University"
have been printed. They give news of goings on at
other colleges and discuss at great length the pro-
posed d i s a f f i l i a t i o n on p o l i t i c a l grounds of the N.U.S
from the International Union of Students. (I.C. Un-
ion d i s a f f i l i a t e d from the N.U.S. f o r similar reasons
some years ago). Ofte page i s devoted to reviews,art-
i c l e s a nd a short story and the fourth page to Univer-
s i t y sport.
The newspaper i s well brought out. Really up-
to-the-minute news i s included and i f the a f f a i r s at
U.C. tend to attract an undue share of attention t h i s
i s probably the f a u l t more of other colleges than of
the e d i t o r i a l board.
The a r t i c l e s are good and the reporting, i n gen-
e r a l , e x c i l l e n t . One write-up i s marred by an abom-
inable t r i c k of using a question and answer form with
no f i n i t e verb i n the interrogative. The staccato
effect produced i s probably int»nded to rouse the rea-
der - i t c e r t a i n l y achieves t h i s but not more r e a d i l y
or less p a i n f u l l y then would rack or thumbscrews. But
i n general we may say that "The University" i a the pro-
duct of a l o t t o f very hard work and -quite considerable
j o u r n a l i s t i c and l i t e r a r y t a l e n t .
It i s unfortunate that t h i s talent i s so wasted.
London University has a d e f i n i t e function as an exam-
ining body, as a useful pool of a t h l e t i c strength to
compete with other u n l v e r s i t i e d and as an organisation
i n which colleges within f a i r l y easy reach of each ot-
her can f i n d suitable opponents and r i v a l s . London
University can and does serve no other real purpose.
It i s useless to compare London with Oxford and
Cambridge and other u n i v e r s i t i e s where a l l students
from whatever college attend the same lectures.Here
i n London each college i s an independent unit strug-
g l i n g against almost overwhelming odds to avoid bec-
oming a 10 to 5 sweat shop. Any deployment of f o r c -
es to foster an unrealisable and only dubiously des-
i r a b l e "London U n i v e r s i t y " S p i r i t " i s not merely a. wa-
ste of time but might possibly be a disservice to the
individual colleges.
The contributors to "The University" should con-
sider whether the joy of writing f o r a very large but
p a r t i c u l a r public i s j u s t i f i e d when that public has
only a very nominal cohesion. Jj H

ANSWER TO CHRISTMAS PROBLEM
The clue to t h i s problem l i e s i n the fact that no-
body would say that he was a black man, f o r a black
would say he was a white, since he always l i e s , and
a white, t e l l i n g the t r u t h , would give the same r e -
Ply. So when the second and t h i r d man both said
that they were white men, they were giving no clue
to t h e i r i d e n t i t y . In the same way the f i r s t man
must also have said •Bhat he was white. So the sec-
ond man's statement sawat the f i r s t man's reply - that
he was a black man - was untrue, thus proving the sec-
ond to be a black man. On the other hand, the t h i r d ' s
answer that the f i r s t had c a l l e d himself a white man
was true. He thus proved himself to be a white man,
and e l i g i b l e f o r rescue.

The F e l i x and the Teddy Bear
Were both proposed together,
To cheer the hearts of I.C.'s men
In f a i r and foulest weather,
But though at once great talk arose
Of Action there was none
We l e f t some other brighter sparks
The Coronation Stone.
