FELIX
LETTERS THE EDITOR
HALL DIHHER
S i r - Polypheme, i n your l a s t issue (so long ago),
took the Musical Society, among others, to task f o r
supporting Dinner i n H a l l . I must admit that i n
organising t h i s shameful a f f a i r I was somewhat em-
barrassed at the response from our music makers i n
College as well as those who help us from adjacent
colleges. We t o t a l l e d 80. Very n e a r l y everyone
wanted to come. Polypheme thought that b r i n g i n g
so many people from one club destroyed the main
purpose of a Dinner, v i z to enable people of d i f f -
e r i n g opinions to come i n t o contact with one ano-
ther; yet what b e t t e r example could you have of
people of d i f f e r i n g opinions than s c i e n t i s t s and
musicians?
Polypheme (who I take i t i s a male giant) asks,
why not hold a club dinner i n the proper manner l i k e
law-abiding Union members?* But s u r e l y to do t h i s
would only r e s u l t i n separating the musicians from
the rest - a p i t y , I think, f o r both p a r t i e s . Would
i t not be b e t t e r f o r Polypheme to ginger up "the r e s t "
u n t i l there i s such a clamour f o r places at H a l l Din-
ner that no club could stand a chance of swamping
H a l l Dinner?
But I agree - 30 was r a t h e r too many when our ac-
commodation i s s t i l l so l i m i t e d .
Tours faithfully,D.M.Tombs.
* I t would seea a "Club"Dinner"were more appropriate
to giants l i k e Polypheme.

Dear S i r
j u s t a few l i n e s I was reading the 'evening 1
about the houseing shorted w e l l I thinks those people
who hare got f a t s and house to t h e r e s e l f should be
made to share them a l l given up and l e t somebody with
c h i l d r e n we gota s i n g l e g i r l l i v e i n g i n stevens t e r r -

there are plenty more l i k e her I think i t time the

A P h i l o s o p h i c a l Group has been s t a r t e d w i t h i n the
L i t e r a r y and Debating Society. Philosophy i s i n -
cluded i n the s y l l a b u s o f science students at many
continental u n i v e r s i t i e s . I t i s f e l t that P h i l -
osophy i s an i n t e r e s t i n g subject f o r d i s c u s s i o n and
d i f f e r s from p o l i t i c a l d i s c u s s i o n i n t h a t the r e s u l t s
a r r i v e d at can sometimes be of p r a c t i c a l value.
The group w i l l i n v i t e speakers to address them
on subjects of p h i l o s o p h i c a l i n t e r e s t and d i s c u s s i o n
groups w i l l be held. I f there i s enough i n t e r e s t
i t might be p o s s i b l e to arrange a course on p h i l o s -
ophy at Imperial College.
The f i r s t meeting o f the group w i l l take place
on Thursday, 8th Feb, i n the Zoology theatre at 5.15
p.m. Dr. Whitrow or the liaths. Dept. w i l l speak on

'BRAINS TRUST'
Jan. 8th, 1950.
Gir - For several years the annual programme of the
L i t e r a r y and Debating Society has included a Brains
Trust. We have i n v i t e d several notable p e r s o n a l i t i e s
to I.e. f o r t h i s year's event, arranged f o r Thursday,
Feb. 27th.
For the maximum h e n e f i t from the 'Brains', an
ample supply of r e a l l y worth-while questions i s r e -
quired. I therefore appeal to the readers of FELIX
to produce as many as p o s s i b l e , and to send them t o
the Secretary, L i t . & Deb. Soc., v i a the Union l e t t e r
Yours f a i t h f u l l y , Paul G. J e f f e r y ,
Hon. Sec., Imp. C o l l . L i t . & Deb. Soc.
'IMPERIAL COLLEGE EXPBDITIONS'
Jan. 5th, 1950.
S i r - I t gave me very great pleasure to read i n your
l a s t number that I.e. are c o n s i d e r i n g organising f u r -
t h e r expeditions. The 1938 Jan Mayen expedition un-
doubtedly brought great p r e s t i g e to the College, but
I am c e r t a i n i t d i d f a r more than t h a t , i n the case
of i n d i v i d u a l members. They gained an experience
ahd\a sense o f achievement t h a t i s d i f f i c u l t to put
i n t o words, but which were w e l l worth a l l the s a c r i -
f i c e s that had to be made i n order to take part i n
the expedition.
As i n most e x p l o r a t i o n , whether i t be topograph-
i c a l or purely s c i e n t i f i c , i t i s extremely d i f f i c u l t
to explain to the m a t e r i a l l y minded people,just what
i s the use of i t a l l . Fortunately, the man who i s
keen to go and f i n d out things f o r himself, i s not
r e a l l y worried by what other people t h i n k , and when
h i s quest i s over he i s more than c e r t a i n that i t was
w e l l worth while.
Since the war, apart from government sponsored
large expeditions there have been few s c i e n t i f i c ex-
peditions other than those organised by various u n i -
v e r s i t i e s to take place during the long vacations.
Such 'long v a c ' expeditions have developed greatly
i n the l a s t 2 o r 3 years and there have been as many
as 6 or 7 d i f f e r e n t U n i v e r s i t y expeditions i n the f i -
e l d each summer. These expeditions, from St.Andrews,
B r i s t o l , Birmingham, Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, Oxford,
to mention some, have covered a wide f i e l d of i n v e s t -
i g a t i o n i n such places a s Gambia, P e r s i a , Kenya, Nor-
way, Spitzbergen, Greenland and Jan Mayen.
It i s good therefore to f e e l that the s p i r i t of
adventurous i n v e s t i g a t i o n i s reawakening i n the form
of a combined I.e. e f f o r t , and I very much hope the
expeditions w i l l be a great success.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y , A. Stephenson,
Reader i n Surveying, Dept. of C i v i l Engineering.
(Mr. Stephenson i s also d i r e c t o r of surveying and cur-
ator of instruments at the Royal Geographical Society;
i n t h i s capacity he has supplied many expeditions with
instruments and advice; i n a d d i t i o n he has himself
been a member of many expeditions i n recent years.-Ed.)
THIS OHRISTIAH FAITH
P a r t l y as a r e s u l t of i n t e r e s t shown during the Mis-
sion i n London U n i v e r s i t y l a s t term, the LIFCU has
arranged a s e r i e s of meeting* on the C h r i s t i a n F a i t h ,
to be h e l d every Monday (except during exams.), at
1.15 p.m. i n the Botany Lecture Theatre. This s e r i e s
i s s p e c i a l l y designed f o r t hose who know l i t t l e about
the C h r i s t i a n F a i t h - and perhaps consider i t i l l o g i c -
a l * or i r r e l e v a n t t o present-day circumstances - and
wish to know more about some of i t s aspects. Questions
w i l l be i n v i t e d .
We are confident that the f a c t s that w i l l be pre-
sented are worthy of the consideration of every true
s c i e n t i s t - and abundantly worth p u t t i n g to the t e s t . ,
Geoffrey S. Bishop, Hon. Secretary.

Wilson paid 3/6 f o r a h a l f and R.H.G.Weighill of the
Services XV was asked 7/- f o r a coco-cola! It i s be-
l i e v e d that the record f o r the evening was created by
Paul who r e t i r e d to bed at 11a.m. the morning follow-
ing. For those who could remember her size i n nylons
and f a v o u r i t e perfume there followed a few hours f r a n -
t i c shopping and on the morning of the 2nd we said
"goodbye" to P a r i s with heavy hearts and l i g h t pockets.
A mid-channel storm made many regret the e x c e l l -
ence of French cooking and the f i n e r points of the New
Year's Eve c e l e b r a t i o n s . I f you would hear more of
t h i s tour, the Union bar any Saturday night, 7-30 t i l l
10-30 i s the best place to f i n d out, but readers be-
ware! The answer to the question "Do you speak Eng-
l i s h ? " must always be NO!
