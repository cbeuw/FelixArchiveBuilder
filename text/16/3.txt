NO NEWS IS SAD NEWS!
When the E d i t o r i a l Board sat round the t a b l e
l a s t meek they c o u l d f i n d few crumbs f o r our v o r a c i -
ous c a t . We sat and thought, we s a t , F e l i x jumped
i n t o the e d i t o r ' s l a p with a p l a i n t i v e look i n h i s
eyes, the s p o r t s e d i t o r ran round the t a b l e and the
r e s t of the board dozed o f f . Then one of the b r i g h t -
er among us showed us the reason f o r our so f a r emp-
ty pages: No news! Nothing had happened t h i s term!
The ghost of apathy haunting I.C. n f t e r the f r o l i c s
of l a s t term - the S p r i n g of our year - the s l o t h f u l
genie of the brown bag was reappearing, encouraged
and emboldened by the prospect of exams. Or c o u l d
we hope that the general t o r p o r was j u s t the a f t e r -
math of Christmases too w e l l spent?
Whatever the reason, FELIX had then r e c e i v e d
only two l e t t e r s , a few e n t r i e s f o r Coming Events,
a piece of s t r i n g and a brass button. Now t h i s i s
not gocd enough f o r a c o l l e g e of c a t - l o v e r s . FELIX
expects b e t t e r treatment of f e l i n o p h i l e s . I f t h i n g s
get no b e t t e r the FELIX Board w i l l be o b l i g e d to go
out and make t h e i r own news by burning down the
Union or shooting the P r e s i d e n t .
At the time of w r i t i n g we have r e c e i v e d a few
more a r t i c l e s and news items and we hope t h a t d r a s t -
i c a c t i o n w i l l prove unnecessary. However, we would
urge you, our readers, to make more use of our cor-
respondence columns. In FELIX you can a i r your
g r i e v a n c e s , g r i n d your axes, communicate with your
enters, c a s t i g a t e your enemies or perhaps even r a i s e
a laugh. There i s p l e n t y to write about. What has
followed, l a s t term's b o l d words about a c o l l e g e mas-
cot? What has happened to the Beaver Club? What of
the controversy over d i v i d e d l o y a l t i e s i n s p o r t ?
Has the r e f e c t o r y - so soon - balanced i t s budget?
And i t s food values? Bones of c o n t e n t i o n are simply
l i t t e r e d about the p l a c e . There are dozens of top-
i c s that deserve p u b l i c i t y and d i s c u s s i o n . I f FELIX
i s to be more than a l a s t r e s t i n g p l a c e f o r the
hidebound notions of the e d i t o r and h i s minions, you
must take up your pen and w r i t e ! We p r i n t almost
anything!
A l i t t l e t a r d i l y , FELIX wishes you a happy and
b u s t i n ' New Year.
