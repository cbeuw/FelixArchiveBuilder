Well fudge-packers, it's the moment you've all been waiting for...
The winner of the PlayStation 2 is... Chris Tickner.
Congratulations good buddy, yours was the first correct grid to be drawn
out of the tombola - in case you're wondering the sheet was from issue
1214, the very first issue to feature GFQQ!. That, however, is besides the
point. What really matters is that you can come and collect the prize next
Tuesday in the Felix office as part of an exquisite prize giving ceremony
featuring myself and the good trouser snake (B.C.). I'll hopefully be giv-
ing away a similar prize next year, but I might change the rules a little -
a final play-off featuring nude peanut-butter wrestling springs directly to
mind. It's been a long year folks, and although it sometimes get lonely
back at the old ranch, with just an open spit-roast to keep me warm, your
crossword entries have always kept my spirits up, if not my pecker.
Cyclops and I are going to spend the summer in an open-top Cadillac on
a pilgrimage from the Fudge Ranch to Gracelands, scouring the Bible
Belt for young, silky-skinned recruits. So until next time friends, I shall
make like a hyphen... and dash. Dr. Hot Fudge.
