£100k Charity Total
It's been a while since the last R A G
Ramble, but things in the world of
Raising and Giving money for charity
haven't stopped. With the help of a few
short emails and an extremely large cal-
culator, Felix can announce that Imperial
students have, over one year, raised over
one hundred thousand pounds for various
good causes!
So many groups and indi-
viduals have committed
their time and effort to
helping good causes, from
organising entire charity
weeks to sponsored runs,
pub crawls, abseils, Great
Hall shows, the London
Marathon and dressing up
as Pudsey. Some events
have raised more than oth-
ers, but every single penny
raised means extra cash
for charities that desper-
ately need it. Below, in
order of magnitude but
without numbers (this
charity thing isn't an ego
trip, right?) the people
who have contributed to
that incredible charity
total are:
• The ICSMSU R A G Week
team chaired by medic
Hayley Kirsop raised
phenomenal amounts for
CLIC, the 3H Fund and
Parkside Hospital Radio.
• Islamic Society's charity appeal sup-
ported Islamic Reliefs work in
Afghanistan.
• ICU Rag Week, organised by the ICU
R A G committee, raised funds to build
the first Shooting Star Children's
Hospice in West London.
• Daniel James & Joanna Wiser ran the
London Marathon for Scope.

the A g e d at a Royal Albert Hall concert.
• LINKS Society's Jenni Wood organised
sponsored abseiling for St John
Ambulance.

raise cash for any charity you want to
support. So if you're feeling dangerous

That's if the sabbaticals don't decide it's
too offensive... Useful as both a revision
aid and spare toilet paper, it costs a quid
and proceeds go to the Shooting Star
Trust, building a home for terminally ill
children in Kensington, Chelsea and all of
West London.
Going for the bum...
