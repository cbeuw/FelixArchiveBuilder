Better than the hype, how-
ever, is the reaction that the
bar has already received i n
the first few days of being
opened. Last Friday s a w the
first bop, and there are many
reports of students arriving at
9:30 i n the evening to be
turned away due to over-
crowding being a fire risk.
While this was the first night,
many are expecting the next
few Fridays to be just as
packed, as more students turn
up to see whether the new bar
is as good as they have been
told. There have even been
fears that this may lead to less
money being taken i n the
older South Kensington Bars,
as students from that campus
investigate the n e w facilities
that are now available.
Of the students who attend-
ed last week, an overwhelm-
ing majority were very posi-
tive about the bar, with most
citing the large amount of
space and central bar as their
reasons. Only a few have been
negative, the most common
concern being the proximity of
a hospital to a bunch of loud
and drunk students. Despite
this, those w h o attended
claimed that it was generally
quiet as students left the
establishment, and apparent-
ly 'the sound doesn't travel'.
In addition to the refurbish-
ment of the bar, the basement
gym has also been re-done
and is n o w a fully functional
cardio-vascular gym with all
the standard equipment. It
was opened by former zoology
student Simon Dennis, w h o
was a gold medallist i n the
British Men's Rowing Eight,
during the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. Due to a lack of any
ribbon to cut, however, he pro-
nounced the g y m open b y
