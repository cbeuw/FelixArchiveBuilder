THE WINNER OF GFQQ 2002 IS...
by B o b b y C y c l o p s & Dr. Hot F u d g e
If your name is Simon North, then w e are about to relieve your exam stress by announc-
ing that you are the winner of G F Q Q 2002!! You w i n a brand new Sony (we think) DVD
player, worth £300 - it looks like the dog's bollocks so get salivating buddy!
It was a close run thing, but Mr. North was ahead from the start and he was always going
to be difficult to catch. A big thank-you to all the players for entering, especially Anthony
Rodrigues who battled gallantly right to the very death, and kept us amused w i t h witty
innuendo and tales of sexual endeavour (occasionally of the bestial nature).
All in all it's been an emotional ride: the dizzying highs, the canyon scraping lows, scour-
ing our video collections for worthwhile quotations, coming up with new and controver-
sial bonus questions, and for what? So Simon North gets his grubby mittens on a top of
the range DVD player, crafted lovingly by one of the worlds leading technological manu-
facturers? To while away a disturbing percentage of our chocolate and confectionery scoff-
ing lives in the Felix office, deep i n the festering bowels of the Beit Quad? We think so.
A n d yet, somehow it seems worth it. Despite the endless questions from irate players:
"why aren't my points on the leader-board?"; despite the continual analysis of Star Wars
bonus questions, ad absurdum; and being constantly picked up by you, our adoring pub-
lic, when we misspelled a quote or put a comma in the wrong, place. It was worth it, and
we've loved every minute.
What new drama will the future bring? Will Simon North be able to retain his title? Will
Anthony Rodrigues conquer his demons and return triumphant? Will some little scrote of
a first year take all the glory?
That's the END of GFQQ for this year, but we'll be back
Bobby Cyclops & Dr Hot Fudge.
