This was originally sent many
moons ago, and I'm sorry that
it is only going in now. I know
that it's not really better late
than never at this stage, but
here it is anyway... -Ed
Europe's largest student
relay races are the Hyde Park
Relays, which are organised by
Imperial's cross country club.
Every year sees n e w friends
coming to take part for the first
time, as well as the return of
the regulars. The 54th Relays
took place on Saturday 16th
February. Due to the
renowned quality of the race,
the first guests arrived on
Wednesday, and like last year
these were the Polish teams.
Again w e challenged them
to a game of darts but unfortu-
nately due to the comprehen-
sive manner of our defeat last
year, they merely laughed at
our challenge. The Polish
found themselves i n our most
luxurious accommodation,
(also known as Southside),
which they thoroughly enjoyed
as it is now part of their pre-
race ritual. There were signs
that they were starting to take
the race seriously as well as
not only were they seen train-
ing just after their arrival, but
they had also brought over a
runner i n last years World
Athletics Championships (he
ran 400m i n 45.6).
On Thursday it was time for
the arrival of the Dutch and
Italian teams. We had been
warned i n advance that the
Dutch would be bringing a
large team, but were delighted
when w e discovered that this
number was 170. The Dutch
also brought over their game of
hopsy-flopsy, but after the
activities of last year it had to
be banned due its dangerous
content. Arriving at midnight
they were raring to go and
many of them decided that
London's night life should be
Hyde Park Relays
sampled immediately. South
Kensington isn't unfortunately
quite the 24hr place that some
had hoped for, but they found
Trafalgar Square and enjoyed
themselves.
Friday started w i t h the
almighty baggage storage
event (rumours suggest that
Roly and Mike are being head-
hunted by BA), as all of the
bags had to be moved into
storage for the day. This could
have been a major problem but
it all went fine and so w e could
relax. Friday night w a s
Valentine's night at the union,
and the place was packed.
Current IC students tended to
find that, 'I don't recognise
anyone here', as lot of our
guests decided to join the
party, however this meant that
there were females i n the
union. Also on Friday w e saw
the arrival of the German and
Spanish teams, but to our huge
disappointment the girls from
Stirling didn't make it. We also
saw that the Irish didn't make
the trip across, though this
could be due to their sexual
exploits being broken up last
year.
On the day of the race, our
guests found themselves
being woken up at 7am again
(unfair advantage?!), as our
Leader (aka Demetrious)
decided that things still need-
ed to be done before the race
could begin. After breakfast
(who had some?) w e split up
and started to organise things.
The course needed to be set-
up and this saw the return of
Westminster's captain Mike
Boucher. A slight problem
arose as it was discovered that
the map showing the course
was inaccurate, but former
London marathon winner
Hugh Jones appeared and
being our saviour, managed to
re-measure the course before it
was too late, enabling accu-
rate results.
Whilst some members were
busy with this, others were
registering the teams, distrib-
uting numbers and selling t-
shirts. Soon the first aiders
began to arrive, with the mar-
shal's and timekeepers
appearing at the bandstand,
so w e knew the race would
soon begin. The official starter
of the race was the legendary
coach Frank Horwill. After he
was found (drinking i n the
union) w e moved him over to
the start and the race began.
The men were rurining six legs
of 5150m, whilst the women
were doing 3 legs of 3350m. A
good field had entered both
races with the notable excep-
tion of Loughborough.
However after challenging us
to a drinking race at BUSA, 2
weeks earlier, w e didn't think
that they would show their
faces.
To ensure that the leaders of
the races didn't get lost on the
glorious day w e employed the
use of two cyclists Roly, and
Geordie Boy w h o cycled i n
front of the front runners so
that they knew where they
were going. IC got off to a fan-
tastic start with Francois run-
ning what ultimately proved to
be the sixth fastest time of the
day. After this w e found that
in the men's teams there was a
split between those racing and
those who wanted to enjoy the
experience for as long as pos-
sible. Imperial's A team in the
men's race finished 5th from
the student teams out of over
70 finishers. What made the
day even better was the fact
that our A,B and C teams fin-
ished 1st, 2nd and 3rd out of
every student team from the
University of London that
entered. Our women keen to
take some glory for them-
selves, and also performed
with distinction being the first
college from the University of
London to finish.
Following the run w a s the
tea and presentation ceremo-
ny. Dan once again excelled
himself and along with help
from other members of the club
managed to give away (eat?)
all of the food and drink. The
winners of the prizes included
the Outdoor Activities club,
who defended their title of
best internal team convincing-
ly and also the teams from
Bativieren w h o collected 2
wooden spoons.
The after race party w a s
held i n the union again this
year, but with the presence of
a barbecue outside from 10.
The D J this year was our very
own Mike Wilcox (can take
bookings for weddings, bar-
mitzvahs, wakes...) w h o
excelled everyone's expecta-
tions by actually playing good
music i n Db's (a first?).
Unfortunately though, the
drinking games didn't go
entirely to plan, as the organi-
sation fell apart (rigging the
draw to face the eventual win-
ners in the first round) and so
we were unable to defend our
title, though a special thanks
needs to go out to John w h o
saved the day by joining the
team at the last minute (where
was Grant?). The night ended
with Daisy Boy taking a spe-
cial interest i n a Polish girl
("I've given my sleeping bag
away, what can I do now?").
Sunday began with dreary
heads rising as our guests
began to leave, and w e could
contemplate returning to our
beds. We would like to thank
everyone for all their help i n
the event, and hope that next
years' event can rise to the
tough challenge of being as
good as this one.
PS If anyone has any good
ideas of what to do with 200 t-
shirts please get in touch!
