this week
Editorial
I'm afraid I'm feeling a lot bet-
ter this week. How dull is
that? I'm unlikely to rant
about anything to speak of,
and what makes it worse is
that I now have this entire col-
umn to fill, and frankly I don't
really feel up to it. I may actu-
ally have to write a proper edi-
torial, and discuss sensibly
and with forethought some
item of news that fills one of
the earlier pages. I don't know
why this is. Apparently it's a
tradition, or an old charter, or
something. But anyway, my
opinion is obviously more
important than anyone else's,
so I get a whole page to
express my unsubstantiated
and ill-though out opinions.
I woke up in a strange place
yesterday, and was wander-
ing back in the direction of
College when I received a
phone call reminding me of
the opening of the Charing
Cross Bar. This may not actu-
ally mean much to many of
you, since I have been made
aware of the fact that most
non-medics are under the
impression that all the medics
are in the BMS. This isn't true.
There are many other campus-
es dotted round London (none
of them actually named after
the part of London they're in,
but hey, then people might
actually be able to find them. I
actually went to Charing
Cross, once. How stupid did I
feel?)
Anyhow, there's a big hos-
pital i n Hammersmith called
Charing Cross (CX), and it has
a lot of students in it, and they
used to have this bar, affec-
tionately referred to as the
'airport lounge', and it really
wasn't very nice. Certainly
people retained some sort of
misguided affection for the
place, but there we are.
Then came a man called
Lome (who shall forever be
spoken of in hushed tones,
but I met him once, oh yes I
did), a n d he managed to
secure 1.5 million pounds to
redo the place (cutting quite a
long story short). 1.5 million!
A n d this guy's only a student.
I think that deserves a round
of applause, because with
this cash they have refur-
bished the bar in CX, and I
have to say it was really quite
pretty.
But, boys and girls, this is
where it breaks down. I've
given up drinking. Can you
imagine? I have given up for a
week, starting from yester-
day! A bar opening, and my
first day of not drinking! I was
not impressed. A n d to make it
worse, the girls behind the
bar were (for the most part)
friendly, but of this lack of
drinking they were frankly
disparaging (which is a good
word). How am I meant to flirt
if I'm not drinking beer, eh?
Tell me that. It is the source of
my power. Without it I am
nothing. Less than nothing. I
need alcohol!
A n d this is only day two, of
seven. Erk.
So, two points. One, go to
CX bar, because it rocks, and
the bar staff are nice (hi,
ladieeees). Two, I'm not drink-
ing, so for this week you can
rest safe in the knowledge
that I'm not there. A n d you
don't have to be a medic! So if
you live i n Hammersmith,
Fulham, etc, go there instead
of the expensive pub down
the road. Because it's full of
students, cheaper beer, and it
makes more money for the
Union as opposed to
Wetherspoons.
CX Bar is on St. Dunstan's
Road, Hammersmith. Head for
the hospital, then follow the
drunk student noises.

I don't ever know what
to put in this space. It's
the weekend, and there
are rarely any official
events to talk about, and
I'm getting bored of just
talking complete tosh.

Is it yet? I don't know. I
just like the feeling that
you all might read this
trying to see if it's all it's
hyped up to be, and then
be really cross when I
succeed in not talking...

...about it in any useful
fashion at all. For all you
