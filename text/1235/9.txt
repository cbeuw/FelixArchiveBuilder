Monday
But I don't know what to
do about this. I suppose
it's 'cos it's Monday, so
there are no events due
to the assumption that
you're all hung over
after the weekend. I am.
Trivia
You can always rely on
trivia. Tests all through
your life, and now here
you are being tested in
your spare time! Why?
Money, of course,
da Vinci's, evening
Wotsits Of Joy
Yummy, and cheesy, and
only 80% chance of find-
ing a piece of cardboard
in your mouth. You know
the drill. I'd imagine
you'll drink something.
Union, Before B-Byes
Strumpet Flinging
Local prostitutes will
present themselves m
classic wench costumes,
and be thrown around
by massive knicker-elas-
tic powered catapults.
Hyde Park, 6am
Dolly Mixtures
These aren't, I don't
think, the ones with Mr.
Bassett, the big sweety
man, so you don't have
to have nightmares just
yet. But one day...
Be There, Or Be...

Star Wars
...last night, and actually
already know exactly
how good (or bad) it
might be. Should you be
excited? What are they
cloning anyway? Does
cute little A n i turn bad...
Star Wars
...in this one, or is it all
just a load of hype sur-
rounding a fair budget of
special effects? Well I
could tell you, but where
would the fun in that
be? After all, I know...
Star Wars
...you'll go and see it
anyway, because you
can't resist the sweet
allure of Ben Obi-Wan
'McGregor' Kenobe, and
you want to be the first
kid on your block...
Star Wars
...to o w n all the action
figures, but I've already
got the very rare Darth
Maul, so nah nah nah
nah nah! I'm better than
you are, and your dad
works for my dad...
Star Wars
Yes he does! Does too!
Does too! Well you smell,
and I don't want to be
your friend anyway. Oh
go and see it. See if I
care anyway.

Annihilator
Methinks these guys
take themselves a little
too seriously. Perhaps
they will bite the heads
off chickens while
screaming satanic rites?
Underworld
Latch
Possibly, judging by the
name, a little Indie. One
word, one syllable, no
references to armaged-
don. They're probably
death metal, now.
Monarch
Enrique Iglesias
You can't go, because
it's all sold out, but it's
happening very near
here, so I just thought I'd
warn you. You may even
hear it in your room.
Royai Albert Hall
Electric Soft Parade
In a similar 'name dic-
tates style' vein as earli-
er, I predict synth music
that should have been
left in the eighties. But it
wasn't, so go along.
Astoria
Del A m i t r i
Yippee doo! Well,
they're a bit old, but
what can I say. This is
my g-g-g-g-generation,
baby, but not that band,
obviously. I can wish.
