State Of The Union
A n n u a l General Meeting
The Union annual general meeting will
take place on Thursday 16th May. It is a
chance for everyone to find out about the
various Union activities this year. It will
also be a chance to ask the officers of the
Union about their work this year. The
main feature will be the elections for
Union officers for next year. The nomina-
tion papers are on the President's board
(level one of the Union Building). You can
email me for more information.
Degree A w a r d i n g Powers
As some of you are aware the College has
applied for reserve degree awarding pow-
ers. Currently the College awards
University of London degrees but the
College would like to award its o w n
degrees under the Imperial College name.
This will also allow greater control over
our degree programmes and be an impor-
tant part in the strategy towards increas-
ing the global brand of Imperial College.
It is fully expected that w e will be award-
ed these powers later this year.
Summer Ball
Many of you would have seen the bright
pink posters for the Summer Ball. The
event will be taking place on Saturday 8th
June. Currently the acts include
CornerShop, James Taylor Quartet,
Scratch Perverts and Artful Dodger.
Added to that the event will feature fair-
ground rides, games stalls, cocktail bars
and more. It promises to be bigger and
better than ever before. Tickets can be
obtained from the Union Reception.
Charing Cross
This week also saw the official opening of
the new student facility at Charing Cross.
This project is the biggest since the
development of the Beit Basements and is
located in the Reynolds building. This
new facility features a brand new bar,
cafeteria, BOP area complete with D J
booth, stage and lighting. The new facili-
ty also features a brand new gym in the
basements. The project greatly improves
student facilitates on the Charing Cross
Campus and is open to all students. Keep
an eye out for publicity on the events tak-
ing place there this term.
Beit Quad
The Beit Quad will undergo a facelift over
the coming weeks. The project will see
new lawns and paths laid with improved
facilities in the quad. There will also be
new bike racks for students to use. The
Union will be open for business as usual.
Lost the Union?
Apologies to all those who have been
confused by the location of the Union
reception and the Student Activities
Centre. This has in part been due to the
necessary heating works in the building.
Just to clarify the new permanent home
of the Students Activities Centre (formal-
ly known as the Resource Centre) is in the
East Wing of the Beit Basements. The
Union reception will be located on the
first floor (access via the East staircase)
and will move back to its normal position
next week.
