U.S. Cycle Challenge
This summer I, Tom Scorer, am
cycling across America from
Seattle to Boston, travelling
through sixteen states and
two countries. The journey
will take me over the Rockies,
the planes of Central America,
Pennsylvania a n d N e w
Hampshire. I will encounter
many types of terrain and con-
ditions, from the peaks in the
Rockies to the planes and heat
of South Dakota. I will also be
raising money for Whizz Kidz
During the challenge I will
be entirely self-reliant and will
carry all I need to live for that
time, except for food and
water! I w i l l be taking all
camping equipment, clothing,
tools etc with me and pulling
it behind me i n a specially
designed trailer.
It has been a life long ambi-
tion to do this trip. I have been
training hard for the last 2
years to build up the core fit-
ness I will need to complete
the distance of 4,500 miles in
less than 70 days, an average
of 70+ miles per day.
M y primary aim is to com-
plete the cycling challenge but
I felt that it was also a great
oportunity to raise awareness,
and money for Whizz Kidz.
Whizz Kidz is a national chil-
dren's charity with a very sim-
ple goal - to give disabled
children independent mobility.
By providing specialised
mobility equipment, Whizz
Kidz improves the quality of
life of disabled children across
the UK and literally lets chil-
dren be children.
The route has been planned
for 64 riding days (at a 70
miles/day average) w h i c h
gives me 6 full rest days dur-

ing the 70 day period. The
days have been planned tak-
ing into account both the ter-
rain and conditions I am likely
to experience so are likely to
change! I aim to leave in early
July and return in the early
part of September.
I am going to be having a
number of fundraising events
for Whizz Kidz in the next few
weeks t h e 1st being this
Wednesday 15th May, There
will be a Bermuda Triangle
Pub Crawl starting from the
New Charing Cross Bar start-
ing from 11am. (Nearest tube
Hammersmith)
Those that want to come
and help raise money and
have an awesome time can
pick up collecting tins, pub
crawl guide and collecting
licences from the bar and go
and have fun!
We have organised some
really good deals at some of
the pubs along on both Drink
(both Soft and NOT) and Food.
The Route in Brief:
The Pub crawl is going to be
going from Hammersmith to
South Kensington on the tube,
then onto Paddington where
we have loads of deals with
different bars in the area. Next
from Edgeware Road to
Embankment then back to
Charing cross where there is a
cocktail theme night waiting...
Anybody is welcome to
come and help raise money:
you don't have to drink; w e
will need sober minders.
Anybody that has any ques-
tions should contact Tom on
