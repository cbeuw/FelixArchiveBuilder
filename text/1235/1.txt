'Airport Lounge' Takes Off
The n e w bar on the Charing Cross
Hospital campus was officially opened
last Tuesday, a week after it had come
into active operation.
Situated in the Reynolds Building on St.
Dunstans Street, this n e w bar is the
result of the refurbishment of what w a s
(somewhat) affectionately k n o w n to
older students as the 'Airport Lounge'.
The total cost of the project w a s around
1.5 million pounds, and on entering the
bar it is easy to see where this money has
gone.
In addition to the fully licensed bar,
there is a 'snack' shop w i t h fixed seating
area, and a dance area which contains
sofas a n d chairs by day, w h i c h are
cleared away to form a dance floor by
night. Needless to say there is a huge
sound system and a video projection
screen to accommodate the entertain-
ment of a standard night out.
The project w a s initially started by
Lome M c E w a n , President of the Medics'
Student Union last year, his original
intention being to refurbish St. Mary's
The New Bar at Charing Cross
Bar i n Paddington. However, when it
became clear that this w a s not going to
be possible for space reasons, he turned
his attention to other campi, with this
final result.
Despite original problems getting fund-
ing from the Union, Mr. M c E w a n eventu-
ally managed to find independent fund-
ing from three sources: the Faculty of
Medicine itself, Hammersmith Special
Trustees, and College itself. He also has
the fortune to be one of the few students
who has ever seen a project completed
during their time here, with the total
undertaking completed i n less than two
years.
Another unusual aspect of the bar is
the license, the hours of which have been
extended by special permission after a
deal w a s struck w i t h the West London
Magistrates Court. Having heard that
medic students work very antisocial
hours, the magistrates agreed that the
Students' Union would not have to apply
for late licenses o n Wednesday a n d
Friday nights, but that they should be
granted to the Charing Cross Bar as a
matter of course.
