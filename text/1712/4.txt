T
he world has
a problem.
Absent from
the front pages
of our newspapers and
digital screens is one of
the largest humanitarian
crises in modern history.
Often referred to as “The
Forgotten War”, Yemen
has been caught in the
middle of violent conflict
between the Houthi forces
– an anti-government mil-
itant group – and the Saudi
Arabian led coalition – a
group of nine African and
Middle-Eastern countries,
of which the UK and US
have provided intelligence
and logistical support. In
the past 3 years, wide-
spread destruction has
erupted across the coun-
try with bombing and
shooting threatening the
security of its people. This
has driven the country
into an emergency where
22.2 million people are
in need of humanitarian
assistance, making up
approximately 75% of the
entire population.
Food supplies and
clean water are scarce,
precipitated by attacks
on local infrastructure.
Strategic aerial and naval
blockades imposed by the
coalition to stop Houthi
military supplies has
limited the Yemeni people
from receiving even the
most basic of goods.
With 90% of Yemen’s
food supply being reliant
on foreign exports, these
blockades have had
disastrous consequences
on the people’s access to
food. Worsened by the
deteriorating economy
– with the Rial losing
nearly 50 per cent of its
value – affected families
struggle to purchase food
as a result. All of this
means that Yemen is now
struggling with one of the
largest famines in history:
an estimated 12 million
Yemenis, including 2
million children, will be
dependent on food assis-
tance in 2019.
Diseases that have
almost been eradicated
from the country have
reappeared, with out-
breaks of cholera and
diphtheria posing a threat
to Yemen’s health infra-
structure. Violence has
led to the destruction of
water and sanitation fa-
cilities, allowing cholera
to spread quickly. Over a
million cases of cholera
have been reported thus
far, meaning that Yemen
is currently facing the
world’s largest ongoing
cholera outbreak. Further-
more, those who require
medical treatment can’t
afford it and with some
20% of health facilities
having been destroyed,
the health system is in
a state of near collapse.
This, amongst targeted
attacks on civilian homes
and buildings, contravene
international law.
This atrocity cannot be
ignored within campus.
Therefore, charity socie-
ties on campus including
Amnesty, Doctors
Without Borders, Save the
Children and Unicef have
decided to collaborate on
a week-long campaign
kicking off on Monday
4th February, to shed light
on the humanitarian crisis
in Yemen. Some of the
work of these NGOs are
shown below.
Amnesty is working to
stop the flow of weapons
to Yemen. The UK and the
US have made and sold
weapons to Saudi Arabia
that were then used to
destroy schools, hospi-
tals and other civilian
children through over 150
fixed health facilities, 21
hospitals and five mobile
health and nutrition teams.
They are involved in the
prevention of hygiene
related health diseases
with raising awareness.
They also train health
volunteers in the preven-

infrastructure in Yemen.
These arms sales only
fuel the ongoing conflict,
and by stopping the sale
of weapons, violations
against civilians could be
curbed.
Unicef has been
tackling Yemen’s cholera
outbreak with the im-
provement of sanitation
and access to clean water.
The water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) pro-
gramme allowed 6 million
people access to drinking
water through the oper-
ation, maintenance and
rehabilitation of public
water systems.
Save the Children is
treating sick and injured
tion and management of
malnutrition.
MSF (Médecins Sans
Frontières) are fighting
against malnutrition in
Yemen. Between January
and October 2018, MSF
hospitals and supported
health facilities have
treated 4,855 cases of
malnutrition. With over
2,200 MSF staff working
on-the-ground across
12 hospitals and health
centres, they have so far
treated 973,098 patients
in their emergency rooms.
Please come along
to our lunchtime stalls
from the 4th of February
to the 8th of February
to donate and find out
more. We are also hosting
a charity dinner on the
5th of February and a
speaking event on the 7th
of February. Details can
