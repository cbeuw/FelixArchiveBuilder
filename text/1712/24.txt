race left in the LUCA XC League
After a strong showing at last week’s penultimate league race at Alexandra Palace ICXC sit atop both the women’s
and mixed standings with UCL clipping at their heels

A
s dawn broke
on Alexandra
Palace, the
birds began to
sing and the mud glistened
brightly in the morning
sun.
The day was set to be
a cold one, with a gentle
dew hovering over the
freshly watered grass, and
patches of bog forming
after the recent rain.
Meanwhile, away from
the tranquility, Imperial’s
Cross Country Club were
beginning to assemble in
Beit Quad with rumours
flying of the treacherous
hill and deep mud that
awaited them 16 stops
away on the Piccadilly
line in the outer-reaches
of Zone 3.
The trek from Wood
Green tube station up to
Alexandra Palace will be
familiar to those who are
fans of reasonably-sized
gigs, the World Darts
Championships, or the
recent Masters snooker.
However, the squad
were not making this
journey to be entertained.
They were making this
journey to compete in the
fourth race in the London
Universites and Colleges
Cross Country League.
After a successful
outing at the third race
in Wimbledon Common
back in mid-Novem-
ber (see Felix, 23rd
November), the club were
seeded 3rd in the men’s
league, were leading the
women’s league by a
sizeable 97 points, and
were also top in the Mike
Baggs Trophy Standings
with the notorious St.
Mary’s just 2 points
behind.
The Mike Baggs
Trophy is in its inaugural
year and combines scores
from both the men’s and
women’s teams in all the
races, with teams scoring
8 points for a win, 7 points
for a second place, and so
on.
In doing so, the
Mike Baggs Trophy has
become the top prize in
the London Universities
Cross Country scene,
and Imperial travelled
to Ally Pally looking to
inch closer to lifting this
prestigious award.
After a hasty warm-up
and a rousing team talk
from the club captain,
the runners once more
gathered on the start line
for another cross country
“The
compulsory
face paint
masked their
grimaces as
the incline
began to take
its toll”
race, questioning why
they continued to subject
themselves to such unap-
pealing exploits.
As usual, the starting
whistle caught all the
runners by surprise and
the stampede began, thun-
dering along the bottom
of the park, hugging the
treeline, and transversing
the most waterlogged part
of the course.
A number of partici-
pants were clearly seen to
be regretting their choice
of shoes, with flat, gripless
road shoes very much
unsuited to the terrain.
Slipping and sliding
theirwaytothefirstcorner,
the mass of runners were
directed around a hairpin
bend and the slow, steady
ascent of the hill began.
By this stage the race
had begun to stretch out,
with Imperial’s famous
navy and red vests
packing well up the order,
notable for their depth and
faces of determination.
The compulsory
face paint masked their
grimaces as the incline
began to take its toll
and soon mud turned to
harder ground with those
wearing spikes struggling
to maintain good running
form on this new surface.
After what seemed like
an age for the runners but
in reality was probably
less than 1km of uphill,
the route took a sharp turn
and led the runners down
the steepest part of the
hill, reminding some of
the athletes about various
differentials from lectures.
This part of the course
saw the athletes taking
a number of different
tactics, with some opting
to take the tarmac, others
cautiously descending on
the muddy grass verge,
and a few simply closing
their eyes and hoping for
the best.
The outragously steep
and hazardous descent led
back to the start/finish,
leaving the women to
complete one further lap
and the men two addition-
al circuits.
In the women’s race
Imperial scored the first
1-2-3 of the year, with the
podium filled by Georgia
Curry (1st), Kate Olding
(2nd) and Alex Mundell
(3rd).
This was a dominant
performance from the
girls, with Mundell finish-
ing 43 seconds ahead of
the 4th placed athlete.
Remarkably, Imperial’s
final scorer for theA-team,
Chloe Baker, came home
just 4 seconds behind 4th
to finish in 5th, giving
the Women’s A team an
almost perfect 593/594
points for the fixture.
In the overall standings,
Curry and Olding sit joint
first on 595 points with a
30 point lead over 3rd.
The champion will
surely be decided by
which of them can win at
the final fixture.
Hopefully this com-
petition will rub off on
the team who - barring
disaster - will retain the
Women’s title ahead of
UCL who currently lie
122 points behind.
Back in the men’s race,
Imperial’s Niki Faulkner
cruised to a bronze behind
strong performances
from St. Mary’s and UCL
athletes.
Second home from
the boys was rising star
Charlie McFadzean who
finished in the top 10 for
the first time with a 9th
placed finish. Just outside
the top 10 was orienteer-
ing scholar Mihaly Ormay
in 11th, and the A team
was rounded off by good
runs from Mark Pollock
and Fergus Johnson who
finished within 1 second
of one another.
ThiswasImperial’sbest
Men’s performance of the
season, all-but-guarantee-
ing them a podium with
Reading languishing far
behind in 4th place in the
league.
It is also worth noting
the depth of Imperial’s
squad, with Imperial
leading the B, C, D,
and E(!) teams in both
the men’s and women’s
leagues.
In fact, Imperial’s
Women’s B team are
currently in bronze medal
position overall which
could result in an unprec-
edented double-podium at
the final race next month.
Additionally, with St.
Mary’s failing to field an
entire women’s team, the
result now leaves Imperial
3 points clear in first place
in the mixed Mike Baggs
Trophy Standings with
just one race to go.
With UCL close
behind, Imperial will need
that both their men’s and
women’s teams average
second place in the final
race to ensure they bring
home the title.
The final race of the
season takes place at
Wormwood Scrubs on
Wednesday 27th
February.
