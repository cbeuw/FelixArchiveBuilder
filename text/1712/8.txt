La Traviata continues to delight
V
erdi’s La
Traviata is
undoubtedly
one of the most
well-loved and familiar
operas of all time. First
performed in London at
Her Majesty’s Theatre
in 1856, it is now the
most-performed opera in
the world. This particular
production of the Royal
Opera House, directed by
Richard Eyre, celebrates
its 25th anniversary this
year.
Across the years,
many sopranos have
sung Violetta in various
productions. But few
have managed to embody
Violetta, the famed cour-
tesan and ‘fallen woman’
of the title. Angel Blue is
certainly one of them. In
the American soprano’s
Royal Opera House debut,
Violetta blossomed into
life on stage, drawing
the audience into her tale
of passion, sacrifice and
sorrow. From the heights
of merriment in the
drinking song - Libiamo
ne’ lieti calici - to the
troughs of sorrow and
longing in her last song
before she dies, Blue
perfectly embodies the
rich emotion that carries
Violetta and the opera
through.
Blue was a delight as
part of the second cast of
this production. Her voice
was rich and multi-lay-
ered, and the emotion
in her arias so palpable
one could almost touch
it in the air. Violetta’s
passion, and subsequent
sacrifice of her happiness
for the reputation of
Alfredo, were beautifully
put across. In one of the
most perfectly-executed
scenes, Giorgio, Alfredo’s
father (Simone Piazzola),
comes to ask Violetta to
leave his son for the sake
of his family’s reputation.
The tension hangs in the
air as Giorgio starts off
contemptuous, only to be
gradually touched by Vio-
letta’s sincerity. Violetta is
devastated, then remorse-
ful, as she agrees to sacri-
fice her life with Alfredo
for Giorgio’s daughter,
telling him that his ‘young
and pure’ daughter must
know of her sacrifice in
the future. Piazzola’s
Giorgio fully understands
that his request is a selfish
one - however, it is one he
believes he is entitled to in
view of Violetta’s status
as a courtesan. The way
he flinched when Violetta
asked him to embrace her
as a daughter was telling
of his contempt that later
melts into respect and
remorse.
Blue’s Violetta stands
her ground, walking a fine
line between self-respect
and her unconditional
love for Alfredo. She
plays neither the innocent
victim nor the wronged
woman. Instead, she faces
her fate with a kind of
stoic resignation and a
respectability at odds with
the reputation that Giorgio
accuses her of.
Benjamin Bernheim’s
Alfredo, on the other
hand, starts off shy and
tentative as he meets
Violetta for the first time
at her party, then shines
with happiness when they
are living together in the
country. When Violetta
leaves him at his father’s
behest, Alfredo reveals
his stubbornness - his
belief that the Baron had
taken Violetta away from
him made him truly un-
pleasant at Flora’s party
later on, where he throws
his gambling winnings at
her as ‘payment’ for her
time with him. Bernheim
perfectly captured the hurt
and insult thatAlfredo felt,
and the loss of control that
led to his outburst, and the
remorse that wrecks him
immediately after.
La Traviata is such an
oft-performed and classic
opera that it is difficult
to do anything fresh
without appearing con-
trived. However, in this
production the cast have
provided subtly fresh in-
terpretations of their roles
in front of a grand, gilded
set that transports us to
1850s Paris. It definitely
ranks as one of the more
interesting productions
of La Traviata in recent
years.
The Wedding – a powerful portrayal of the society
P
hysical Theatre
company Gecko
have produced
The Wedding to
tackle the large social
issues we face today.
Performed many times
since its development in
2015 and toured in 2018,
this presentation was
shown at the Barbican
as part of the London
International Mime
Festival 2019. Created
by Amit Lahav, it fuses
impressive staging, move-
ment, fast choreography,
music and minimal dia-
logue composed of many
languages.
The show opens with
giggling and laughter,
with the performer sliding
down a chute landing
on teddy bears repre-
senting the innocence of
childhood. In no time a
wedding dress is fitted
and the performer after
brief hilarity is quickly
wed to the workplace.
This sequence repeats and
we see how The Wedding
is about our marriage to
society as much as the
process.
The workplace seems
stifling and oppressive. At
one point four performers
are inside a tiny box, three
managers quizzing one
man. The small window
begins to steam up and you
feel the pressure rising, as
if you were also inside.
In a striking moment the
man rises from the box,
appearing to be hung from
his own tie. In another a
woman fights for her indi-
viduality among the many,
struggling to breathe
while trying to convince
others to join her. The
use of breath is extremely
powerful throughout the
piece and really heightens
the tension at crucial
moments.
Other workplace
problems were explored
as well. A striking scene
using white props shows
an internal struggle
between the domineering
work life and alcoholism.
Another moment shows
the strive to become a
manager, with them all
reaching for a red suitcase
during some beautiful
group choreography, for
it ultimately to be won at
random.
The fast-paced nature
of the workplace is
sharply contrasted by the
refugee characters. What
starts off as a humorous
addition, one character
coming from a suitcase
followed by three others
later becomes tragic.
Towards the end, one of
the refugees is sickening-
ly turned into a dancing
monkey for the bosses
clothed in a bomb vest and
gun. This leads to a brutal
hate crime, in a scene hard
to ever forget.
Alongside these strug-
gles the elite are shown
towering above on a
high table, without the
need to step through the
marriage process. Thus,
it is immensely cathartic
watching the socialist
revolution rise at the end,
where the elite is pulled
down from their stilts.
Followed by a moving
group choreography
where all are entwined to
rebuild each other. The
final rhythmic chorus of
the show brings hope of
a collective unity, often
found lacking in these
political times.
The whole piece is
led by a strong cast of
nine who were given a
well-deserved standing
ovation. It was refreshing
to see a piece not shying
away from a political nar-
rative, regularly breaking
the fourth wall to connect
with its audience.
With impressive
staging and lighting
throughout, the choreog-
raphy and music perfectly
combine to make an
unmissable performance.
One which will leave you
full of hope for society,
alongside anguish at the
many injustices.
