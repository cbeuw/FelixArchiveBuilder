Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, yet another Sony
Spider-Man reboot, but it’s actually good?
Spider-mans long running career of Tobey Maguire awkwardly dancing, Andrew Garfield being completely
forgettable and Tom Holland evaportating into dust, what more could Into the Spiderverse possibly bring? A lot
S
ony pictures is
very hit-or-miss
when it comes to
super hero films.
Sam Ramey’s Spider-Man
trilogy can probably be
credited with kick-starting
the modern superhero
boom, in which Spider-
Man 2 is still widely
considered an exemplar.
However, it’s been a
bumpy ride. Fantastic
4 has had three films
over two incarnations
ranging from mediocre
to unwatchabl--did you
even remember there
were Ghost Rider films?
Spider-Man Homecoming
was brilliant, but Marvel
clearly had a guiding
hand on it, and Venom
was nothing short of
terrible. Pair that with
animation house that pro-
duced Hotel Transylvania
and The Emoji Movie
and you have me very
sceptical. However, Into
the Spiderverse defied all
odds by not only being the
best animated movie of
the year but possibly the
best Spider-Man movie
ever. Let’s get into it.
I’ll start with the
obvious. This film is
gorgeous, the com-
ic-book-mimicking style
works exceptionally well,
withexpressivedetailslike
motion lines and thought
bubbles fitting right in. I
was struck by a moment
where one of Miles’s
thought bubbles actually
bumps into someone in
the background because
it was both a funny detail
most would miss and a
demonstration of how
much care went into every
frame. The three less con-
ventional Spider-Chaps
are all animated in their
own style, each distinct
from the others while
feeling consistent with the
film as a whole. On top of
all this, I cannot oversell
how fluid this film is in
motion, from the charac-
ters to the environment,
it all just works. Through
“This film is
gorgeous, the
comic-book-
mimicking
style works
exceptionally
well”
“If you see two
films, make it
this one twice”
style and skilled direction
sequences, what should
be clusterfucks are clean
and easy to read. This film
has more artistic flare than
anything from Pixar in the
last ten years and is worth
a watch just for that alone,
but there’s more than one
string to its bow.
Miles Morales is a high-
school kid from Brooklyn
who has recently trans-
ferred to a fancy boarding
school across the city at
the behest of his father.
He is unhappy in his new
setting and thus sneaks
out one night to spend
time with his uncle and
gets bitten by a radioac-
tive spider. This coincides
with the activation of a
particle accelerator which
brings a series of parallel
Spider men-and-women
to his dimension. Now,
they need to find a way
to get them home before
Miles’s dimension is torn
apart. I could go into more
detail, but A) I think you
should experience this
film for yourself and B)
the plot is nothing too
ground breaking, it’s the
characters who really
shine.
Miles is not just black
Peter Parker, he is his own
fully realised character
with a history, thoroughly
developed relationships
with his family and a set
of motivations and strug-
gles which are at once his
own while also fitting the
Spider-Man mould. A lot
of care went into adapting
him for this film--and
they absolutely nailed
it, I think I may prefer
movie Miles to comic
Miles at this point though
I’ll need to see the film a
few more times just to be
sure. Midlife crisis Peter
Parker is great, while he
is technically a secondary
character the film makes
sure to give him well-
thought-out motivations
and flaws which com-
pliment his relationship
with Miles. He is also
an absolute riot, with an
unending flow of hilarious
lines just as you’d expect
from a seasoned Spi-
der-Man. Then we have
Gwen Stacey making
Spider Woman’s cinemat-
ic debut. Like with Peter,
she has her own back story
and drives, but bonds
with Miles and develops
because of it while also
serving as something of
a straight man to the rest
of the team. As an aside,
I realised there is going to
be an entire generation of
kids who will only know
Gwen as Spider Woman
and not as the most
prolific dead girlfriend
in all of comics. That’s a
good thing by the way, a
very good thing. All the
other spider people get
their moment to shine and
just enough personality to
make them memorable.
Special mention needs
to be made for Nicholas
Cage as Spider-Man
noir, stealing the show
whenever he’s around.
Each of the Spiders get
their own introduction
Netflix version, but he
suits the movie perfectly.
The rouges galley overall
does a good job, and there
are some standouts, but
this really is the heroes’
show.
Don’t let my gushing
make you think the film
is perfect, there were cer-
tainly aspects that didn’t
work. There is a moment
or two which feel maybe
a bit too convenient, and I
find it hard to mourn while
listening to Post Malone
but that may just be me.
However, the soundtrack
is generally excellent and
fit Miles’s world well.And
that’s the thing, all my
quibbles are nothing in the
face of what a complete
triumph of animation
and storytelling this film
is. It is so stuffed with
little details, references
(anyone else remember
clone high?) and hints
at a broader world that
I had to force myself to
stop writing. The good so
vastly outweighs the bad.
If you see one film this
month, make it this one. If
you see two films, make it
this one twice.
