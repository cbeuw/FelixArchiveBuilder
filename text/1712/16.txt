P
oland is prob-
ably the most
under-rated coun-
try of the Baltic
states. It sounds distant,
cold, under-developed,
stuck in the past. None of
which is true. Speaking
from personal experience,
I too was apprehensive
about visiting Poland. In
simpler words, I was not
excited at all. But on a
student budget it seemed
like a great idea at the
time. And what a great
idea it was!
Poland is cheap: from
flights to accommodation,
food and drinks, it is an
ideal destination for a
weekend getaway.
It is a known fact that
it is almost impossible to
escape from history in a
country like Poland (or
any European country
for that matter…). We
all think we know, the
brutality of its wars and
invasions, the liberation
and re-birth of a country
and the deep marks all of
it left on the country and
its people. It is still very
visible what Poland has
had to endure throughout
history and that extends
well beyond its borders.
But if anything, it makes
visiting Poland even more
special.
In memorium to the
victims of World War
I, the Polish-Soviet
War, World War II and
Holocaust there are
countless museums, mon-
uments, churches, talks
and tours, all of which
are truly unique. The
Auschwitz-Birkenau con-
centration camp is a must
visit for what it teaches us,
for how it makes us feel
and for what should never
be forgotten. If history is
your not-so-secret guilty
pleasure, the Museum
of Second World War in
Gdansk is indescribable.
city getaway. Think col-
ourful old city centres, flea
markets with handcrafted
goods and paintings,
food stalls and music. In
Gdansk get hold of amber
jewellery at Mariacka
Street; in Wroclaw find
the gnomes (there’s over
300, each with a different
story!); in Krakow visit
the Wieliczka Salt Mines.
Warsaw, while its old
town is still very impres-
sive (check out the view
from St. Anna’s Church!)
Warsaw is a modern
city with a solid night
life and growing street
art scene. It even has a
vegan district – can you
find that in London? Must
do’s: POLIN museum,
Copernicus Science
Centre and Palace of
Culture and Science; free
Chopin Concert (May to
September); the pub crawl
in Pawilony district.
For a longer holiday
Masurian Lake District
and Trata Mountains is
a must for the thrill and
nature seekers. Skiing in
the winter; camping, rock
climbing and kayaking in
the Spring-Summer.
where they usually eat.
You will not understand
a word, the menu will be
in Polish, but you will not
be disappointed! Food is a
way of travelling too! Pro
Tip: google some dishes
in advance if you’re a
fussy eater. Traditionally
must try’s: “pierogi” (just
look it up!), “bigos” (meat
stew), paczek (wild rose
jam donut) or zapiekanka
(mushroom and cheese
open sandwich).
