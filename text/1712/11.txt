the late
poet Mary Oliver on her
radio show ‘On Being’
back in 2015, she re-
ferred to Oliver’s poem
‘Wild Geese’ as “a poem
that has saved lives”.
This might seem an
exaggerated claim, but
for me at least, it holds
some truth.
For a teenager in the
last year of school, caught
in the frenzy of applying
to universities, success
seemed rigidly defined.
Six years of formal
schooling was successful
if I got into the university
of my choice. Failure was
not getting the requisite
grades at A-levels. We
were writing and con-
stantly reworking essays
for American colleges to
make ourselves sound
interesting, outstanding. I
was torn between what a
future career should look
like, and what I desperate-
ly wanted to do.
This period of time,
although so distant and so
inconsequential now, felt
tumultuous then. It was a
time when we were trying
to give our nascent, till
then constantly-evolving
identities, some shape.
It was during this period
of uncertainty that a friend
slipped ‘Wild Geese’ into
one of my notebooks, and
thus introduced me to
Mary Oliver. “You do not
have to be good”, read the
opening line. “You only
have to let the soft animal
of your body / love what
it loves.” While I was
caught in the decisions of
my small life, the poem
reminded me that “mean-
while the world goes on”,
like the wild geese that are
“To speak to
people of all
walks of life is,
I feel, a marker
of poetic
success.”
heading home again, like
any other day.
While the poem cer-
tainly didn’t save me from
a burning building, it
went some way to saving
some part of my soul. It
reminded me that there
were larger things in life,
that expectations were
externally imposed after
all. It reminded me to look
to nature and wonder at its
vastness and my place in
it. “Whoever you are, no
matter how lonely, / the
word offers itself to your
imagination”, and no one
can take this connection
from you.
As I discovered more
of Oliver’s poems, I
realised that this was the
beauty of her words – to
evoke nature so simply
and deftly, and relate it
to personal struggles.
Oliver’s poetry is rooted
in the Romantic nature
tradition, and reminds one
of Emerson’s essays and
the poetry of Whitman
and Wordsworth. She
writes of vast painterly
landscapes – the sky, the
sea, the rivers – but also
celebrates the smaller
detail of nature. “How
great was its energy, /
how humble its effort”,
she writes in ‘Song of the
Builders’, contemplating
the efforts of a cricket
moving the “grains of the
hillside”, then relating to
“each of us going on / in
our inexplicable ways /
building the universe.”
Rather than ostenta-
tious displays of natural
beauty, Oliver chooses to
focus on quiet, unassum-
ing images of nature. In
capturing these so perfect-
ly, her poems encourage a
constant sense of wonder
and appreciation of the
beauty all around us. As
she describes in ‘When
Death Comes’, “When
it’s over, I want to say
all my life / I was a bride
married to amazement
./ I was the bridegroom,
taking the world into
my arms.” Indeed, if her
poems are any indication,
she has certainly lived her
life amazed at the world,
humbled by its beauty.
While Mary Oliver is
one of America’s best-
loved poets, she had often
not been taken seriously
by poetry critics in her
lifetime.Noneofherbooks
received a full-length
review in The New York
Times, and in its review
of a magazine in which
Oliver was interviewed,
David Orr laughed at the
idea of poetry as self-help,
revealing the general
contempt of poetry that
meets popular culture.
Oliver was by no means
unrecognised, though –
she won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1984 for her fifth poetry
collection American
Primitive and New and
Selected Poems won the
National Book Award in
1992.
In fact, it is precisely
the accessible nature of
her work that makes her
such an important poet.
A few of her books have
appeared on bestseller
lists; Gwyneth Paltrow
reads her, and Cheryl
Strayed used her poem
‘The Summer Day’ as an
epigraph to her memoir
Wild: “Tell me, what is it
you want to do / with your
one wild and precious
life?”
To speak to people of
all walks of life is, I feel, a
marker of poetic success.
Her poems are in blank
verse, easily understanda-
ble but by no means basic
in its construction. The
images are deftly woven
together, the cadence of
her words bring out these
images. To reveal the
simple beauty of mundane
images is her forte. To
inspire personal responses
with these images is her
genius.

Wild Geese
Mary Oliver
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.
