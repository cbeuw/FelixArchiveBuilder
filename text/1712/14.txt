Conclusion
Esports has slowly but steadily entered the
world of sports betting. The video gaming
industry may have been initiated by a couple of
enthusiasts,buttoday,itisaplatformforawider
audience motivated by E-sports gambling.
However, not everything is fine and dandy
as it initially seemed. Although there is a lot
of money and interest involved, there are still
opposing forces towards the introduction of
Esports into a formal sports roster. Some say
that there is nothing sport-like in them, while
others have issues with the overall violence
present in featured video games.
Fortunately, there are more and more betting
places that accept Esports as a valid sport. It is
no doubt that Esports will only rise in terms of
popularity and it is up to the NJ sports betting
scene to keep up with it.
