A hilarious ode to the UK
we know (not so) well
Lord of the Game of the
Ring of Thrones
A
bdul waits
during the
entire show,
perching in the
top of a ladder and having
nightmares about his
wife who is trapped back
in Syria. Debby stands
for almost half an hour,
strapped to a spider’s web
with a pig-masked guard
always by her side, a the-
atrical version of her days
in the modern slavery sub-
world.Abdulrahman spins
in a hamster wheel, victim
of an administrative bingo
game. Baraa is caught in
the pinball of finding all
the documentation needed
to settle in a new country
in 28 days, running
against homelessness.
Mohand combines several
jobs with the dream of
becoming an actor.
Despite the harshness
of the stories, the tone
is never self-pitying.
On the contrary, we are
invited to laugh at their
misadventures and in a
way learn some shocking
facts about the regulations
asylum seekers face that
challenge us to redefine
“generosity”. There is
an underlying feeling of
resilience, as they know
that sharing their stories
is a way to fight for
better opportunities, to
expose their experiences
to a blissfully ignorant
audience and to give hope
to others like them.
The show itself is
a lovely collection of
personal stories, humour
and creative theatrical
tricks.
From the beginning, the
audience is invited to send
their dreams to the stage,
in the form of balloons.
Light-hearted pictures of
migrant’s everyday life al-
ternate with the plottings
of a system devoted to
creating a “hostile envi-
ronment”. Witty parody
songs with hilariously
crafted lyrics are an essen-
tial part of the show, from
a cabaret describing how
to cope with multiple jobs
to a spoonful of missing
paperwork. Brexit makes
its appearance, prompt-
ing Europeans to join
the refugees in the “one
person, one question” race
for a passport. Beloved
British characters, such
as Mary Poppins, William
Shakespeare and one or
two royals are also invited
to the fun.
Hats off for some ex-
traordinary performances,
including a hilarious
interpretation of Romeo
and Juliet in “who has the
strongest accent” version,
and the best stand-alone
moment of the whole
show, a parody of a Home
Office interview with
intense witchcraft.
Almost as valuable
as the show itself was
the Q&A session that
followed. The audience
had the chance to get to
know the actors behind
the characters and to
understand the creative
process of the company.
There were lots of ques-
tions regarding the regu-
lations mentioned during
the play, and many more
about how much of the
stories were true. Turns
out they all are, albeit
embelished and satirized.
Abdul shared the good
news: his wife obtained
a visa, so they will be
reunited after four years
apart.
Welcome to the UK fills
the stage with humour,
horror, live music and
candy floss, a satirical
portrait of the UK, as
director Sophie Besse
describes it, “with a
Sudanese, Italian, Syrian,
Gambian, Iranian, Iraqi,
Afghani, Zimbabwe,
Armenian and French
touch”.
L
ondon has many
museums, the
V&A, Science
Museum, Natural
History Museum and
even some outside of
South Kensington! One
of these is the Museum
of Comedy, located in
Bloomsbury. On the last
Sunday of every month
for the foreseeable future,
the small venue inside is
seized by the “Hivemind”
improv group for what
they promise to be a night
of hilarity in a one of a
kind fantasy tale.
The show, aptly named
Lord of the Game of
the Ring of Thrones,
applies the classic art of
improv to a story from a
faraway land. Confining
themselves to this type of
fantasy storytelling allows
for a framework which
ensures at least the sem-
blance of a plot, usually an
issue for improv shows.
Presenting themselves
as “travelling bards”, the
performers ask the audi-
ences what story, from the
seemingly infinite stories,
they want. After a few
awkward silences from
the audiences interrupted
by some overzealous
individuals, the world and
the story are created.
The tale will take
place in the great land of
Domtherea (named after
Dom, the first audience
members pipe up with a
suggestion). The capital
city of this legendary land
is the city of Curloss,
known for big hair but
small hats, as shouted
out by one lady in the
front. Finally, an audience
member who probably
had a tough week de-
scribed the land to the
east as being known for
“people with the weight of
existential dread wedging
down on them” and
“kittens”. Finally the great
upside down mountain,
inhabited by horse sized
ducks, aptly named huck,
was introduced. The plot
was to be centred around
an inhabitant or this very
mountain: George, the
smallest of the horse sized
ducks.
Now that the scene has
been set, without even
a millisecond to discuss
anything, it’s time for the
actors to come up with an
hour long show. The key
to an improv show is good
chemistry, and Hivemind
definitely ticked this box.
The group is made up of
ex-Cambridge students
who were part of the
legendary “Cambridge
Impronauts”. Today, they
all seem to have top jobs
in the city so are by no
means improv profes-
sionals but the fact that
they have known each
other and have trained
together for years, means
they play off each other
with ease. There were
definitely some moments
of awkwardness but these
were usually played off
comedically by the actors.
Being part of and wit-
nessing something being
created right before your
eyes is something unique
to improv. It’s exciting.
If you want to laugh so
much you’re face starts
to physically hurt while
watching a fun plot - that
you had a part in creating
- unfold, this is definitely
the show for you!
