HANGMAN
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
N
e g a f e l i x ,
the Union
N e w s p a p e r
and source of
#FakeNews, is under
new management, as
the Negafelix editor was
kicked to the curb for
failing to stay awake
during work hours.
Sandy Djembe, who
was elected to the role
last February, was seen
outside Beit Quad yelling
obscenities towards the
Union Building.
“The role is f***ing
nocturnal, of course I’m
asleep during the day!”,
Mr Djembe remarked,
“if the Union team sent
their pages in time, maybe
once I’d manage to get
the paper in by the actual
print deadline!”
It is suspected that the
sacking was influenced
by the College, with Neg-
afelix’s ever-trustworthy
source in the Faculty
Building reporting the
oust being signed off by
none other than Janice
Fast, College Overlord.
“Yeah, she was pretty
pissed about all those
horoscopes. It was only a
matter of time – I heard
she wanted her oil friends
to deal with him the way
they deal with indigenous
people.”
