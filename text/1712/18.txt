FRIDAY, 1ST
FEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX

gsu.president@imperial.ac.uk
event that aims to exclu-
sively connect postgrad-
uate students from the
Imperial College Business
School to students from
the rest of the College.
Students with entrepre-
neurship ideas requiring
the expertise of business
management, finance or
marketing are introduced
to students from the
Business School, who
can use knowledge from
their studies to aid these
students to move forward
with their ideas. Even
without an idea at hand,
you can still come to GSU
Connect and meet other
students who could help
you turn your science into
a game changing product.
This two-day event
begins with students
spending an afternoon
participating in network-
ing events, leading them
to form inter-departmental
teams with whom they can
spend a week developing
a business proposal.
Following the first day,
teams of 4-5 members can
register to compete at the
second event a week later,
where they will have the
opportunity to compete
against each other (to
ensure teams have a fair
mix of skills, we are
asking that each team has
at least one student from
the Business School).
Student teams will be
given a chance to present
their business proposals
to our panel of judges.
There will be two rounds
of judging to nominate a
group to win a cash prize
of £500. Another group
will also be awarded a
cash prize of £500 based
on an audience vote.
In addition to our won-
derful cash prizes, we’re
offering participating
students free refreshments
at each event and the
chance to network with
our panel of specialist
judges.
The two-day event will
be hosted on the 20th
& 27th
February at the Imperial
College South Kensington
Campus. Please note, this
event is only for postgrad-
uate students.
So, if you’re excited
about learning how to
transform your innovative
science, medicine and
engineering into a poten-
tial business idea, or you
already have a budding
idea, this is the event for
you!

Women in STEM: Report from a conference
I
was at a conference
and a guy from
a research centre
approached me.
Initially our conversation
POSTGRADUATE
Anonymous
Engineering PhD Student
was on research but then
he asked if I would like
to go to a bar with him
after the gala dinner. He
looked at me in an erotic
way that made me feel
very uncomfortable. I
told him that I couldn’t
go with him because I had
arranged online meetings
with people in another
time zone. I returned to
my seat and, when anoth-
er session of presentations
started, he suddenly sat
next to me and started to
whisper his comments on
the presentations. I hinted
for him to stop talking
but it seemed as if he
just didn’t get it. During
the presentation his arm
and whole body leaned
against me - essentially
occupying the table in
front of me so I had to
lean back to escape his
body contact. I even tried
to ask to him to reposition.
However, because of the
ongoing presentation, I
couldn’t say it very loudly
so he pretended that he
couldn’t hear or even
understand me. At the end
of the presentation, while
people asked questions,
he asked me again if I
would like to go to the
bar with him. I said no
and, at that moment, I
knew I wanted to stay as
far away as possible from
this person. I started to
think about how to avoid
him for what remained of
the conference. As soon as
the session ended, I said
that it was nice talking to
him and immediately left
(ran). The next day, during
a break, he asked me for
my name card, to which I
replied that I didn’t have
one; then he asked for my
phone number (instead of
my email). I wrote down
an incorrect one. During
the second (final) day I
tried to avoid him as much
as I could. Whenever he
approached, I tried to
have conversations with
others or stay close to my
colleagues.
Finally, the confer-
ence ended and, when
I returned to my hotel
to pack, I noticed my
umbrella was gone. I
recalled that I left it in
the conference room on
the day when that guy sat
next to me. Since all I was
thinking at the end of the
session was getting rid of
him, I forgot my umbrella.
Unfortunately, I no longer
had the time to return to
the conference centre as
I had to catch a flight. I
called the centre at the
airport and asked if they
had found an umbrella,
thinking that my friend in
that city could pick it up
for me. The centre staff
told me that everything
had been cleaned up and
no umbrella was found.
The umbrella has a
small Totoro image on the
outside and small flowers
inside. It was a gift from
my grandma bought from
the Japan Centre during
a World Expo. She has
never travelled to Japan
but remembered that I
like Totoro. To this day, I
regret the loss of my fa-
vourite umbrella because
I was too hasty, running
away from a douchebag
who came to an academic
conference to hit on
women.
Supervision Story

D
ialogue. I
believe that in
the thorough
yet enjoyable
experience that the PhD
can be, we all go through
times of self-doubt and
questioning. Not only
about the research itself,
but about our own capabil-
ities and the, sometimes,
fearful prospect of having
to finish. I am glad to have
a supportive supervisor.
However, our relationship
would probably not work
so well if I did not feel
like I could talk to my su-
pervisor. I can rely on him
for guidance regarding my
research, and I also trust
I will have his support
when I am going through
hard times in my PhD or
my personal life, affecting
my work. Knowing that
my supervisor is aware
that I am a human being
who makes mistakes and
has limits but is still ready
and willing to give their
best for their work allows
me to step back during
stressful times; because I
know I have support.
What I find interesting
about my relationship
with my supervisor is
that he gives me as much
guidance as I ask for.
For the rest of the time I
am free to conduct my
research in the direction I
would like to take it. This
allows me to be independ-
ent and at the same time, I
am certain that I can rely
on someone for guidance.
At this stage of my PhD
I am still unclear about
what my immediate future
will look like. However,
having the possibility
to experience relative
freedom in my research
gives me a taste of what
it would be like to pursue
a career in academia. In
my Department, I observe
some fellow PhD students
being very much guided
in a specific way, which is
often appreciated. Others
are practically left alone,
with only their peers to
ask for moral support.
sibility from both parties.
Nevertheless, I believe
that students should never
feel trapped in this rela-
tionship. Unfortunately,
many students have the
impression that there is no
way out if the relationship
doesn’t work and that
they must stick with their
supervisor until the end of
their PhD. In my depart-
ment, new guidelines are
now being put in place
so that such situations
could be resolved. But in
the past, I have discussed
with fellow PhD students
who have been ignored by
their post-graduate tutors
when they sought help.
Hopefully this will not
happen any longer, and I
wish that any new student
at College will understand
that no matter what their
situation is, they can
always find support near
them.
