Election season is upon us...
A
s I officially
pass the
halfway point
of my tenure
as Felix Editor and,
with nominations for
the 2019 Leadership
Elections opening on
Monday, I can't help but
acknowledge that the
changing of the guard
is coming sooner, rather
than later. I also can't
shake the feeling that
people can't wait to get
rid of my fellow Full
Time Officers and me.
This wasn't helped by
a meeting we were in
on Wednesday in which
we were effectively
told that Union staff are
going to be pricks to us
for the next six weeks as
election season hots up.
Oh joy...
Anyway, this term's
improved performance
continues as I'm writing
this editorial before 10pm.
Still not quite hit the 7pm
target but we move. I also
stumbled upon how to
use spell check on Adobe
inDesign, which can only
mean good things for the
quality of the paper going
forward
This week's issue of
Felix sees the return of
the popular Postgraduate
section. The monthly
instalment in the paper,
brought to you in
collaboration with the
Graduate Students' Union,
is now in its third issue
and is going from strength
to strength! I encourage
any postgraduate students
reading this Editorial to
submit content for the
section to ensure it is as
engaging as possible. In
particular, I think the "Su-
pervision Stories" series
in particular provides an
important forum for open
dialogue about the crucial
student - supervisor rela-
tionship and its associated
dynamics.
Thisweek,Ialsohadthe
pleasure of interviewing
Emma Tucker, the Deputy
Editor of The Times. I also
2
had a seat at the table for
her meeting with Profes-
sor Lord Robert Winston
and a selection of MSc in
Science Communication
students. The discussion
was interesting and these
are the perks of the job
that I'm really grateful for.
This week also saw the
return of another messy
ACC sports night in the
Union. I actually almost
went to this one. I even
wore pink (on Wednes-
days, we wear pink), but
I couldn't bring myself to
actually set foot inside.
Mabe next time.
I got my hands on a
copy of Warwick's student
newspaper, The Boar. I
tend not to pay any atten-
tion to the other student
publications out there
- don't want to glorify the
competition. However,
I think I'm justified in
saying Felix bangs in
comparison.
Section of the week
for this week goes to the
Books Section. I want
to say a special thank
you to our Books Editor,
Jingjie Cheng. JJ has
done an amazing job of
singlehandedly steering
the Books section this
year. Sadly, she has her
Medicine finals coming
up soon and I am really
going to miss having her
around the office.
Note: This editorial has
been so so dull. I can't
really be blamed though,
not much has happened
this week. In fact, I was
really scratching my
head to think of anything
noteworthy. I don't even
know why people read this
far. In fact, I've received
multiple compliments
about how "open" and
"heart-on-your-sleeve"
I am in these. Whatever
floats your boat, I guess...
I'm flattered. If I could
blush, trust me I would be
bright red.
a clear message that we
value excellence, rather
than just complain when
something isn’t great. By
putting five minutes into
submitting a nomination,
you can (anonymously)
tell a staff member that,
despite all the ways in
which they could improve,
you appreciate them and
the impact that they’ve
made on you during your
time at Imperial. That you
appreciated that one time
that they gave you some
solid advice, or that they
are trialling innovative
teaching methods even
if it doesn’t always work
out. The SACAs make it
easy and mean so much to
staff. See for yourself:
“I felt really honoured
to be nominated. I take
care to deliver the best
teaching I can and receiv-
ing a nomination from
the students makes a big
difference to the way I feel
about spending that extra
time.” - Nominee
the biggest, most mean-
ingful, and most gratify-
ing awards of my career. It
provided me with tremen-
dous motivation to strive
to improve and modernise
my teaching further such
that it continues to be
worthy of the world-class
students that Imperial
attracts. It also gave me
a lot of legitimacy, and
credibility, when provid-
ing input and feedback
to other academics in
terms of how to improve
their teaching in order
to maximise the students'
learning experience.” –
Winner
So, what does this all
have to do with changing
Imperial? Well, every
staff member that gets
nominated, whether it’s
by one or fifteen students,
receives a special mug
even if they don’t actually
win the award for that
category. That mug is
then a daily reminder
that they are appreciated
by students. So why
does that matter? Let’s
be stereotypical Imperial
students and do some
#quickmaths. Assume that
receiving a mug makes a
staff member feel 5, 10,
maybe 20% more confi-
dent in what they do. Now
imagine 10 members of
staff in your department
putting that little bit
extra in. How about 20?
What about 200 across a
faculty? What about the
11 award winners feeling
empowered to continue
championing change?
Studentsgaveoutover900
mugs across Imperial last
year. That’s 900 members
of staff continuing to be
motivated to go the extra
mile for YOU. Get the
picture?
The bottom line is that
every nomination you
submit sends the message
that students value
aren’t missed. There
are 11 categories to
choose from and you can
nominate as many staff
as you like. The more
convincing nominations a
staff member receives, the
higher chance they have
of being shortlisted and
winning an award at the
ceremony in May, so get
your friends to nominate
too!

I
mperial played host
to Emma Tucker,
the Deputy Editor
of The Times on
Monday 28th
January.
After viewing a Data
Observatory showcase
in the Data Science In-
stitute, Emma sat down
with Felix for a brief
interview:
Felix: How do you
think fake news has
affected your job or
the job of being a
journalist over the
years?
Emma: Well I think, in
a way, it clarified our role.
Sometimes I say there’s
never been a better time
to be a journalist because
our mission is so clear
because, if you’ve got a
lot of fake news being put
out and you’re from a rep-
utable publisher, your job
is to tell the truth. Shine
light on the truth, report
accurately.
Do you have any
advice to aspiring
journalists?
My advice to aspiring
journalists is do jour-
nalism. School, college,
wherever it is that you
are, try and get involved
in whatever journalism
is on offer and write. If
you can’t get involved in
a local paper or a student
publication, write a blog.
Just get used to writing
and show your commit-
ment because it’s a bit of
a vocation, journalism.
You’ve got to really want
to do it.
What qualities would
yousaymaketheideal
student journalist?
Tenacity, a slight sense
of mischief, curiosity and
a slight pig-headedness.
You’ve got to be stubborn,
you’ve got to keep going.
What’s your opinion
on the media’s role in
Brexit?
I feel that it wasn’t the
media’s finest hour. I think
in many ways, we got to
where we are because
large parts of the British
media didn’t report the
European Union suffi-
ciently correctly or even
broadly enough. It was
reported in a very trite,
facile way and a lot of it
was seen through a filter
as if we weren’t part of
it, as if it was somehow
imposed on us and the
end result was, I think, a
lot of people were very
ill-informed about the
part we played in it. With
some notable exceptions,
not all the press did that
but, by and large, it wasn’t
treated seriously and I
think Brexit could partly
be blamed on that.
What are your
thoughts on
remaining relevant in
the digital landscape
and the future of print
media?
The old legacy publish-
ers have to embrace data
journalism. You won’t
find any serious news-
rooms that don’t have a
data team. It also opens
up so many more possi-
bilities for investigation,
stories, analysis. A good
data team can supply half
your news list if they’re
really on top of their game
so I think it’s an exciting
new branch of journalism.
In an increasingly
globalised world, how
do you decide which
news to focus on?
That’s such a good
question. I think people,
by and large, want to read
about what they know
so, obviously, we give
more priority to events
that happened in the UK.
I think you have to accept
that you can’t report
everything and, more
often than not, if you’re
picking out a foreign story,
it’s got wider relevance.
Obviously you’re still
going to report catastro-
phes, events, accidents,
earthquakes but, by and
large, the sort of stories
you choose to report will
be because they’ve got
some sort of relevance or
broader point to make.
