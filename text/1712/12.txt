Naked Dough: the good, the bad and the ugly
Have always wanted to try cookie dough but never
gotten around to it? Fear not, we’re back with a full-on
comprehensive review of (almost) everything Naked
Dough has to offer, and our honest opinions (hint:
they’re very good, but read on to find out). We promise
your taste buds will be tingling after this one
“Honestly, it’s
like a massive
real-life
marshmallow,
with neon signs
everywhere
and the cutest
little pentagon-
shaped tables”
R
emember that
cute little stand
that sells big
tubs filled with
mouthwatering cookie
dough that we told you
about in the “2 Girls, 1
Dessert” article earlier this
year? Well, we felt like we
just had to go back and
satisfy our cravings, so
we bring you the ultimate
guide to (almost) every
single Naked Dough
product so that when you
go there yourself, you
know precisely what you
want (I mean, isn’t that
always the hardest thing
when getting food? We
certainly think so).
Decision, de-
cisions
To get a full-on expe-
rience for taste testing,
we decided to visit
Naked Dough’s Westfield
branch, which is the most
adorable little bright pink
stall that smells like a
piece of heaven. Honestly,
it’s a massive real-life
marshmallow and we
are SO here for it. With
neon signs everywhere
and the cutest little pen-
tagon-shaped tables, our
Instagram feeds were also
loving the trip there. The
queue of people vying for
cookie dough certainly
added to the conviction
that this would be a good
experience.
But it was time to get
down to business - was
the cookie dough they
offered up to the Felix
Food standard? Was it
worth all the hype people
were raving about? In one
word, yes. But here’s a
more comprehensive view
on the flavours we tried
(pretty much everything,
yum!) and exactly what
we thought:
Chocolate Chip
Cookie Dough
Julia says: A classic
cookie dough that can be
found anywhere, but cer-
tainly doesn’t disappoint.
Perfectly curated to not
be excessively sweet, but
also to give you that sugar
high that you so desire
(because clearly, a sugar
high is the best kind of
high). The only thing that
could make it better is
more chocolate chips!
Eva says: Your bang-on
classic cookie dough
flavour - you just can’t go
wrong with this one. As
someone with a massive
sweet tooth, I’ve tried my
fair share of choc chip
cookie doughs, but this
one definitely takes the
crown. I was obsessed
straight away, and luckily,
each tub comes with two
scoops of cookie dough,
so I had enough left over
for another week or so!
Rating: 4/5
Kinder Bueno and
Nutella
Eva says: This was my
all-time favourite flavour.
Whether you’re a seasonal
chocolate eater or breathe,
eat and sleep chocolate,
this will 100% satisfy
every single one of your
cravings. We recommend
pairing this with soft
whippy ice-cream (as with
all the cookie dough) else
it’s slightly too rich and
will have you reaching for
that bottle of water!
Julia says: Who doesn’t
love Nutella? Chances are,
you probably love Kinder
Bueno as well as all things
Ferrero. Coming at a close
second for me, the combi-
nation of chocolate paired
with the hazelnut twist
that we know all too well
from our eating-Nutella-
with-a-spoon binges is
a match made in heaven
- although you can’t really
taste the Kinder Bueno in
here, does it matter?
Rating: 4.5/5
Vegan Cookies n’
Cream
Julia says: If you’re
vegan and concerned
about the ingredients used
in typical cookie dough,
this is the answer - one of
two great vegan flavours
offered at ND. Tastes just
like a super chocolaty and
rich brownie (and for the
No-Meat Monday haters
- you really wouldn’t be
able to tell it was vegan!),
smells great and is slightly
less sweet than the rest.
Eva says: Honestly, as
someone who’s always
wanted to go vegan but
was always too worried
about missing out on
yummy food following
an awful experience at
a vegan restaurant, this
cookie dough restored my
faith in vegan food and
felt just like the push I
needed. Probably the least
sweet cookie dough on the
list, cookies n’ cream is
probably the only flavour
you can have with no ice
cream without it feeling
too sickly.
Rating: 3/5
Salted Caramel
and Honeycomb
Eva says: Caramel is
one of those words where
everyone’s complaining
about the pronunciation
- is it car-mel or car-a-
mel? Well, one thing we
won’t be arguing about is
how delicious this salted
caramel and honeycomb
cookie dough is. With
bits of honeycomb adding
a wonderful texture to
the dough and the salted
caramel adding a little
extra oomf, this was
definitely one of my fa-
vourites.
Julia says: Although
this flavour is particularly
sweet, that should not
be taken as a vice - the
perfect combination of
sweet & salty in a tub,
plus it being one of the
more original flavours
definitely appealed to me
and places this in my top
three favourite flavours.
Add some marshmallows
on top and you’ve got a
match made in heaven.
Rating: 4.5/5
White Chocolate
Chip
Julia says: My favour-
ite thing about this is the
noticeable flavour of the
chocolate chunks, which
are often enveloped
too much in the dough
to actually taste them.
Although a bit too sweet
for my liking (dark choco-
late fans hit me up!), it was
still definitely worth a try
and will probably become
one of your favourites if
white chocolate is your
preference (is it really
chocolate though?).
Eva says: White
chocolate is one of my
favourite things ever,
and that combined with
cookie dough is definitely
something worth swiping
right for. This is your
classic chocolate chip
with a twist and is the
most amazingly indulgent
tub of cookie dough. The
small chunks of white
chocolate literally melt in
your mouth, and the after-
taste is something I wish I
could savour forever (and
always).

Sprinkles &
Marshmallow
Eva says: Unfortunate-
ly, after trying so many
amazing flavours, this
was not the one for me.
It tasted like something
they served us in school
lunches way back. Defi-
nitely the sweetest of the
doughs, this flavour was a
little difficult to eat, even
with ice cream to kill the
sweetness a bit, and gave
me the classic “sugar
headache”.
Julia says: This flavour
is like your classic cookie
dough with a little boost
- you think you’re having
the typical, until you
encounter a chewy marsh-
mallow within which
makes this flavour super
cool. The texture is also
smoother than the other
flavours, making it melt in
your mouth - only caveat
is its over sweetening
effect if you consume too
much.
Rating: 2.5/5
Vegan Lotus
Biscoff
Julia says: My number
one top flavour, left for
last! If you’ve ever had the
Lotus spreadable Biscoff
(or the true Speculoos),
you’ll get an immediate
feeling of déjà vu (déjà
goûté?), along with pure
happiness from the in-
dulgent texture that is the
essence of cookie dough.
This flavour is the one I’d
make an exception for and
definitely not leave any
for later.
Eva says: This is the
cookie dough flavour that
got me absolutely hooked.
Lotus Biscoff Biscuits
have always had a special
place in my heart, but the
vegan lotus biscoff was
just out of this world. Pair
it with toppings such as
sprinkles, marshmallows
or even an oreo (double
cookie - genius, right?)
and you’ve got a tub of
divine heaven right there.
Rating: 5/5
The ultimate lowdown
on our top 3? If you’ve
got to pick any, we’ve
made the decision for you:
go for Kinder Bueno &
Nutella, Salted Caramel &
Honeycomb or our fave,
Vegan Lotus Biscoff - we
promise you won’t be
disappointed!
DIY Cookie
Dough
After our amazing
experiences at Naked
Dough, the next step
was to try their DIY
cookie dough to see how
it compared to all the
mouthwatering flavours
we got at Westfield. Does
DIY cookie dough live
up to the high standards
of professionally curated
recipes?
As soon as it arrived in
the post, the excitement
began. The cute packaging
and the pink tissue made
for memorable first im-
pressions. When it came
to actually making it, we
got some friends together
to truly make the most of
the experience. The in-
structions on the package
were pretty simple: add
the cookie dough mix to
some butter and milk, and
stir until combined, and
you get a whole 8 portions
for you and your friends
to share (or just you, of
course!). Initially, we
were worried about the
proportions of milk and
butter suggested on the
packaging, but with a little
patience (a good exercise
to practice the skill of not
eating the whole thing
while mixing!), you will
end up with something
that looks exactly like
the cookie dough served
in their shops. Magic at
work basically.
The taste? Almost iden-
tical to the store-bought
chocolate chip cookie
dough - amazing. And
the best part of the whole
thing is, you can store it
in your fridge or freezer
for a few weeks or even
months (not like it will
last that long, who are
we kidding), so you can
just nibble on it whenever
you feel like it! This also
solves the problem of
getting into a sugar coma
after consuming an entire
tub from the store, but
that’s all easier said than
done really...
Overall, although it
costs £10, the DIY kit is a
pretty worthwhile invest-
ment if you’re satisfied
with the classic flavour
and yields many more
servings than your typical
tub, plus it makes for a
super fun bonding activity
with your friends!
Also, special shoutout
to Steph for allowing us
to try all these different
flavours, and of course
our friends for trying
them all out with us!
So what are you
waiting for? Head straight
down to your nearest
Naked Dough and you’ll
see exactly what we’ve
been raving about! Stores
in Westfield London
or Camden Market are
waiting.
