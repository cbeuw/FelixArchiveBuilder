Smash Corner - King K. Rool, the new King in Town
E
nough talking
about the
veterans, let’s
look at one of
the new faces of Smash.
Say goodbye to Bowser,
King of the Koopas and
to King Dedede, there’s
a new king of the play-
ground, character #67 of
the roster, King K. Rool.
This big bad crocodile is
the main antagonist of
the Donkey Kong series,
and is now a brand new
Heavy fighter in Ultimate.
His hefty mass not only
gives him very powerful
attacks at close range, but
his unique moveset grants
him a decent mid range as
well as protection from
enemies.
Slow as he may be,
King K. Rool still packs
quite a punch at close
range and only needs to
hit a few normal, tilt or
air attacks on his enemy
to get them at kill-percent
for any smash attack.
Although his attacks may
be impressive the real
highlight of his moveset
is his Super Armor. K.
Rool’s golden chest
plate passively blocks
any incoming attacks,
preventing him being
interrupted when using a
‘belly-attack’ (neutral-air,
side-tilt, up-smash and
down-smash). It can
however break like a
shield, leaving you very
vulnerable, if hit too
much or too hard. Hence
a incredibly powerful tool
to use often but wisely.
King K. Rool also does
a decent job at medium
rangethankstohisneutral-
and side-special attacks.
Indeed, with no input
from the stick, K. Rool
will take out his Blunder-
buss, a gun which fires a
slow cannonball, dealing
a lot of damage. Further-
more, if you hold down
his neutral-special, the
gun can suck an opponent
back in and throw them
away. This move can kill
most light characters at
100% damage! For his
side-special, K. Rool
will throw his crown like
a boomerang, creating
additional pressure for
your enemy as it comes
back. In addition to these
projectiles, King K. Rool
has 2 more tricks up his
sleeve. His down-special
is his Gut Check, which
will block a frontal attack
with his Super Armor and
counter it immediately.
And finally, K. Rool has
the best recovery of all
Heavies, with his up-spe-
cial Propellerpack, which
not only brings him back
on stage from anywhere
but slightly damages
enemies overhead pre-
venting any spikes.
Now the problem is
that your opponents are
usually too fast for you,
making it hard to actually
hit them especially with
your slow smash attack.
But worry not, as some
combos exist to help you
secure the kill. The first
one is the ‘Bury & Flop’
which simply consists of a
down-throw or -tilt imme-
diately followed up by a
down-smash; it will bury
your opponent and can
kill them from 60% and
up! An the other one is the
‘Suck & Cuck’, a cheeky
combo that uses the
neutral special off stage
as you are falling to suck
and throw your opponent
under the map. You can
then laugh diabolically
as they fall to their death
whilst you recover easily
with your up-special!
Overall, King K. Rool
can be considered as the
best Heavy in the game,
however he can still
suffer against fast and/or
ranging characters such
as Sonic, Pichu or Marth.
This brings him in low- to
mid-tier in competitive
play, but at low level,
the players sometimes
struggle to punish him
properly, bringing him
up to high-tier. But more
importantly K. Rool is
incredibly fun to play so
lock him in already and
get smashing!
Smash Corner - Ness,Totally Not Sans
T
his obscure char-
acter originates
from Mother 2, a
game originally
released in Japan but given
a western release in 1995
as “Earthbound”. Despite
his little-known status,
Ness has appeared in
every Smash Bros. game
since the original on the
N64. He has come a long
way since, with ridiculous
air mobility and combo
potential this character
has enough depth to get
any fan excited!
The name of the game
for Ness is in his throw
combos and following
aerial strings. At low
percent down throw
combos into most aerials
and at high percent
back throw is one of the
strongest kill throws in
the game. Forward air
has a huge hitbox with
plenty of priority; at low
to mid percent it can even
combo into itself. Up air
has a similar effect and
can be used to juggle the
opponent while racking
up decent damage. Back
air on the other hand is
one of Ness’ main kill
options able to kill in the
low 100’s if hit near the
ledge.
Ness’ depth comes
from the unique ways he
can use the majority of
his kit. His side special
is PK Fire. This is your
main zoning tool as well
as a combo starter. If you
can hit the opponent with
this they will be stuck in
hit stun for a considerable
amount of time.
Ness’ down special is
PSI Magnet. It is a very
unique move as it has both
a hit box and functions
as a projectile absorber,
healing Ness when any
energy-based projectile
comes into contact with
it. PSI Magnet can also be
used to stall Ness’ falling
speed, allowing his less
than stellar recovery to be
much less predictable.
His neutral special, PK
Flash while having potent
kill power is not a viable
move option due to it
being easy to avoid and
having a long charge up
time. This move should
generally be avoided
except for in very specific
situations.
PK Thunder, Ness’
up special, is a steerable
ball of lightning that can
hit either Ness or his
opponent. Hitting your
opponent, a great way to
harass the enemy when
off-stage. Using the ball
to hit yourself is the main
way you’ll recover as
Ness, and if you manage
to catch the opponent with
your subsequent flying
ball of Ness it will likely
lead to a kill.
If PK Thunder and PK
Fire aren’t enough to stop
your opponent getting
back to stage, charging
down smash while at the
ledge (facing inwards)
causes the yo-yo to stall
there, effectively prevent-
ing the enemy grabbing
the ledge.
A good combo to get
you started is as follows:
PK Fire into a grab and
then down throw. Imme-
diately follow up with a
string of rising forward
airs to knock the opponent
offstage.
This deals around 60%
and gives you significant
stage advantage right
from the get go.
I would place the boy
from Onett solidly in mid
tier. He has outrageous po-
tential in the neutral with
high priority moves and
relatively high kill power
(see forward smash),
however his exploitable
recovery leaves him in a
tricky situation against
anyone with a counter
or a reflector. If you’re
looking to learn more, I
recommend checking out
Jtails on YouTube. Happy
Smashing!
