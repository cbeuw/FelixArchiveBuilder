E
lectronic trading
has become an
i n c r e a s i n g l y
important part of
the fixed income market
landscape in recent years.
The rise of electronic trad-
ing has enabled a pickup
of automated trading (in-
cluding algorithmic and
high-frequency trading)
in fixed income futures
and parts of cash bond
markets. These recent
changes have resulted
in a transformation of
the fixed income market
structure, the process of
price discovery and the
nature of liquidity provi-
sion. Electronic trading’s
advance and structural
consequences will have
implications for market
quality and functioning
that are yet to be fully
explored. This article
provides a view of the
rising use of electronic
and automated trading in
fixed income and related
derivatives markets – a
process we refer to as
“electronification”.
Algorithmic trading
is a process of buying or
selling a security based on
some pre-defined set of
rules which are backtested
on historical data. These
rules can be based on
technical analysis,
charts, indicators or even
stock fundamentals. For
example, suppose you
have a trading plan that
would buy a particular
stock if it closes in red
for 5 consecutive days.
You can formulate this
rule into an algorithmic
trading system and
even automate it so that
a buy order is placed
automatically when your
condition is met. You may
even define your stop loss,
target and position sizing
in the algorithm which
impact on the structure
of fixed income markets
and the interplay of
various participants in
the market ecosystem.
Electronic trading has also
contributed to changes in
market-making business
models, a growing
presence of firms
employing automated
trading, and greater
weight being placed by
investors on improving
execution.
The extent of
electronic trading in fixed
income markets varies
significantly but has
been growing over time
globally as shown in Fig.
1 and Fig. 2.
Despite the
phenomenon’s growing
importance, policymakers
direct access to continuous
and comprehensive data
on electronic trading in
fixed income markets is so
far limited. It also presents
the results of an ad hoc
survey of over 30 platform
providers conducted by
the Markets Committee
Study Group. In some
fixed income segments,
electronification is now
nearly as developed as in
cash equities and foreign
exchange.
In some markets, an
increase in electronic
trading has been driven
directly by technological
improvements that have
facilitated a reduction
of the marginal cost of
providing intermediation
services and lowered
the barriers to entry
for companies with a
technology advantage.
Electronic trading is most
advanced in those markets
in which assets are most
standardised and highly
liquid – in particular,
futures and the inter-
dealer on-the-run US
Treasury market.
In conclusion, it is clear
that electronic trading in
fixed income markets is
advancing and that this is
creating efficiencies for
many market participants,
improving transparency
and reducing market
segmentation. It is
important to note that the
appropriate responses
may differ across
jurisdictions because of
the heterogeneous nature
of fixed income markets as

of “electronification”.
Four core areas for
further policy assessment
include: data, disclosure
and monitoring; market
quality and stability; risks
and risk management;
and trading practices and
regulation.

Algorithmic trading
strategies can be
roughly grouped in
three categories: Trade
Execution; Market-
aking; and Directional,
Relative Value and
Arbitrage Strategies.
Trade Execution is when
execution algorithms are
often concerned with
minimising the price
impact of a transaction.
Market-making is to profit
from the bid-ask spread,
while ensuring tight risk
control over inventory
positions and minimising
the risk of transacting with
an informed counterparty.
Directional, Relative
Value and Arbitrage
Strategies are strategies
that attempt to exploit
systematic short-term
patterns in asset prices
or arbitrages; may also
implement strategies
identifying arbitrage
opportunities in markets
with fragmented liquidity.

markets and the resulting
shift in various aspects
of market structure have
had a noticeable impact
on market quality and its
optimal measurement.
