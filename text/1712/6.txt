example of fake news and proposes some measures to combat it

A
recent incident
that was circu-
lated on social
media showed
a confrontation between
high schoolers, some
of whom were wearing
MAGA hats, a Native
American man, and a
group calling themselves
Black Hebrew Israelites,
in Washington D.C. In a
snippet that was circulated
later the smiling teenager
(Nick Sandmann) was
painted as an arrogant,
racist and xenophobic
young man, who ridiculed
and belittled an old Native
American and Marine
veteran (Nathan Philips),
who was beating his
drum. The incident gained
virality and sparked in-
tense online reactions.
Longer videos that were
later posted on Youtube
showed a more complicat-
ed story, where the high
school students stand at
the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial waiting for
their bus and Mr. Phillips
walks straight into the
student group and starts
beating his drum in close
proximity to Mr. Sand-
mann’s face, who smiles
but does not react verbally
or physically. Slurs and
derogatory comments are
being shouted by another
Native American man and
members of the Black
Israelite group, while
the teenagers perform
high school chants. The
whole story can instead
be seen as a stare-down,
common in boxing fights.
Sandmann’s smile can be
seen as either arrogant,
disrespectful or due to the
teenager’s bafflement or
confusion at the situation.
parents. Online activists
even called on potential
universities to reject
future applications from
the teenagers. Instead of
calming the otherwise
minor situation, online
pundits from CNN,
NBC and Daily Mail
as well as social media
activists on Facebook
and Twitter started an
online campaign against
the private all-male
Covington Catholic High
School, in particular, and
against Trump supporters
in general.
It seemed that some
viewed the incident as a
proxy war, a battefield on
which to protest against
US President Trump, the
MAGA slogan, his border
wall proposal and pro-life
supporters. Looking at the
case it is likely that the
media reports amount to
little more than slander
and libel. The case is
unlikely to just disappear,
with defamation suits
in the courts and should
serve as a prime example
of fake news.
Ever since US President
Trump coined the term
“fake news”, it has been
evident that various jour-
nalists have abandoned
their primary job descrip-
tions (i.e. reporting reality
and hard truth backed up
by facts and statistics) and
the government needs to
think about introducing
financial and regulatory
penalties for journalists,
who spread falsehood. A
journalist, whose articles
are retracted, e.g. say
5 times, could lose his
accreditation; media
companies could lose

have instead become po-
litical and social activists.
A system where media
companies are required to
generate webpage visits
and views to be financed
through advertising
proceeds as well as an
overflow of information
and the lack of time to
critically engage with
complex topics, has led
to a toxic environment on
social media, where speed
beats reality. Denzel
Washington, a respected
Oscar winner, famously
described the effects of
too much information as
“the need to be first, not
even be true anymore”.
By reporting fake news
and spreading inaccurate
stories, the media compa-
nies endanger themselves
and their most-important
asset: credibility, which
is hard earned but can be
lost fairly quickly and
is not quickly regained.
Readers, are fed up with
the fake reporting, and are
abandoning the traditional
media outlets for alter-
native media providers
or online personalities
on YouTube. As a result
YouTube’s net revenue,
as a proxy for viewership,
has surged by 75% since
2015.
How can this vicious
circle of fake news be
broken? Three parties
should be involved: I
believe that it starts with
the media companies.
They need to realize the
danger that fake news
poses to them and their
guild and start retracting
proven fake news stories
and issuing apologies to
their victims. Journalists,
who purposefully spread
twisted or fake stories,
should be disciplined ap-
propriately. Additionally,
their license. These could
be measures. The govern-
ment also needs to address
the issue of corporate tax
evasion (e.g. of Amazon,
Facebook, Google etc.)
and how the additionally
received funds might be
used to reimburse media
companies whose content
is being used by social
platforms. This should
reduce the need for
posting clickbait or fake
news stories. Last, but not
least we as readers need
to recognise our responsi-
bility to critically evaluate
the facts, employ multiple
sources and call out fake
news with arguments
backed up by statistics
and science. Readers need
to build their opinion
through own research,
instead of blindly repeat-
ing media statements or
spin stories.

Either way, the incident
seemed too trivial to make
national news.
Meanwhile the oc-
currence spiralled out
of proportion and led to
angry protests and death
threats against the teenage
high schoolers and their
