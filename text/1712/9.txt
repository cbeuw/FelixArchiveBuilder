No Cirque du Soleil - show
F
ollowing the
theme of circus
that started with
last week’s almost
painfully perfect Cirque
du Soleil, the show I am
reviewing this week is
about all the not-so perfect
stuff that goes on behind
the scenes. Scottish circus
performer and show
director Ellie Dubois has
created No Show, a show
bringing failure, defeat
and frustration to the
spotlight. Dubois created
this theatre/mini circus to
show the general public
(by that I mean us, non-cir-
cus people) more than just
“the tip of the iceberg, the
1%” that we are normally
exposed to. No Show won
a Herald Angel Reward
at the Edinburgh Fringe
Award in 2017 and has re-
ceived numerous positive
reviews.
The show focused on
five women dressed in
matching striped outfits,
interacting frequently with
the audience, each getting
her own 15 minutes in
the spotlight. Each of the
women shows off her
own unique talents, from
the ever-so-dangerous
steel-wheel to handstands.
One woman gets lifted up
by some sort of a trapeze
attached to nothing but
her ponytail. During
these acts the women fall
victim to critique and
harsh words from their
colleagues. As the show
promised all the women
fail at some point and are
met with disappointment
and neglect. “Better luck
next time”, “You can try
again tomorrow”, “Push
that smile” and “Could
you show us more splits,
we’ve paid for more
splits” are phrases thrown
at these poor women by
their own peers. More
often than not though,
they succeed at perform-
ing very skillful tricks,
leaving the audience is
stunned. Altogether, the
show leaves a lot to desire
for the audience. Instead
of seeing them fail time
after time, instead of
seeing sweat and tears we
get seemingly very sched-
uled missteps mixed in
with a bit of ill-performed
dark humour. The show
is predictable. During the
65-minute long playtime
we barely delve any
deeper than 10% down
from the tip of the iceberg.
Towards the end one of the
girls gives us a heartfelt
story about going to circus
school alongside boys and
always being “good… but
for a girl”. It is a topic
worth exploring of course,
but the superficiality of
it all leaves something
to desire. A bit over an
hour is not a long time
to go in-depth of course,
but there could be less
jumping around and cart-
wheeling and more explo-
ration of the actual topics.
The show tries so hard to
reach that next level but
doesn’t quite get there.
Sportsmanship and failure
for women is a concept
that has definitely been
explored before to more
success, with films such as
Million Dollar Baby and
last year’s Battle of the
Sexes. That’s not to say
the show isn’t well-prac-
ticed, the tricks do really
deserve applause. But it’s
a visually entertaining 65
minutes at most. The plot
and the acting lack that
little bit of extra oomph.
So, I say: “better luck
next time” No Show!
Anywhere – an exploration with ice
A
nywhere is
a tempting
marvel, prom-
ising a puppet
made mostly from ice,
which slowly dissolves
throughout the piece.
This is the debut UK
performance of Anywhere
as part of the London In-
ternational Mime Festival
2019. L’Théâtre de L’En-
trouvert was formed in
2009 by Elise Vigneron
and aims to create a con-
temporary approach to the
art of puppet theatre.
Anywhere is based
on Henry Bauchau’s
‘Oedipus on the Road’.
Oedipus begins the
journey back from Earth
as a blind beggar, seem-
ingly rejected and alone.
He is followed by his
daughter Antigone. The
more Oedipus walks the
clearer the path becomes
until he reaches the cross-
roads of the worlds.
In the intimate space of
The Pit at the Barbican,
the performance starts
with a lit block of ice.
Upon which a hooded
figure writes the first
lines of the poem, ac-
companied by a crisp
voiceover and discordant
music. The black writing
melts and drips down the
block symbolising tears,
creating a chilling effect
instantly drawing you into
the performance. The mix
of sound, live raindrops,
visuals and eerie lighting
creates a phenomenal
sensual experience.
The ice puppet is then
revealed at the back,
covered in fabric to rep-
resent Oedipus the blind
beggar. Using a white
cane and some small rock
obstacles, you instantly
believe in this full-fledged
silent character, wanting
to reach out to help. A
huge crash, as the ice
block crumbles to the
ground, jolts the audience
out of this state.
At this point Antigone,
Vigneron,joinsthepuppet,
removing the clothing and
revealing the beautiful ice
structure. Vigneron fully
captivates the audience
whilst carrying the puppet
round the slate circle.
The audience are on
tenterhooks, feeling the
pain of walking barefoot
on the many precarious
pieces of slate whilst
understanding the deep
connection between the
two characters.
Throughout the piece
this connection is fas-
cinating; moving from
tenderness to desperation
and by the end loss and
despair. This is beautifully
matched by the slow melt
of the puppet, with the
whiteicebecomingclearer
throughout the piece. As
the puppet begins to melt,
the live rain falls. At the
climax, where pieces of
ice fell off the puppet, the
stage is covered in mist as
Oedipus ascends into the
sky.
During the perfor-
mance little attempts are
made to hide the puppet
strings. The choice to
hoist the puppet from long
strings, controlled side of
stage by Hélène Barreau,
is made a feature at many
points. This highlights the
inevitability of the path
Oedipus would lead and
the struggle Antigone
would have to let go. It
is marvellous to observe
the precise control and
points where turmoil was
represented through the
twisting of these strings.
Whilst I loved this per-
formance and marvelled
at its uniqueness, I am
not sure I would have
fully understood the story
without reading up on it
first. Although, created by
a theatre company which
strives to provoke thought
and asks the audience to
question, perhaps this is
no bad thing.
