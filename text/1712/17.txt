Book Review: Green Giants
A
lthough ‘sus-
t a i n a b i l i t y ’
is a constant
buzzword in
our society and people
seem to understand that
its somewhat important, I
feel that many of us don’t
know what it really means
to be sustainable. Should
we stop using plastic all
together? Should we aban-
don eating all meat and
dairy? Should we never
purchase fast fashion ever
again? How can we, as a
society become more en-
vironmentally conscious?
Making these incremental
changes as individuals
will undoubtedly add up,
but sometimes it can feel
like it will take months,
years, or even decades
until we see noticeable
impacts. But in Green
Giants, Williams explores
the ways in which some
of the biggest compa-
nies in the world have
managed to implement
sustainability into their
business plan to tackle
environmental issues at
its core and enable our
society to take large
strides forward. Natura,
Chipotle, Toyota (Prius),
Tesla Motors, IKEA,
Whole Foods, Unilever,
GE (Ecomagination) and
Nike (Flyknit) are the 9
‘Green Giants’ that are
mentioned in this book.
They are the pioneers of
the inexorable green busi-
ness revolution. What is
truly incredible is that the
annual revenue of these
companies together rep-
resents over $100 billion
dollars, showing us that
with the right strategy and
vision, companies have
the potential to transform
societal needs into busi-
ness opportunities.
As a reader passionate
about sustainability, but
not so aware of business
management, this book
made me realize just
how powerful companies
can be, in contributing
to solve the greatest
challenges of our gen-
eration. The book starts
off with stories about the
individual leaders of these
companies that started it
all and proceeds to go into
details about what it takes
to lead businesses that can
succeed in the long term
- not just economically
but also environmentally.
Although my previous
impressions about ‘green
businesses’ was that
being environmentally
sustainable often came at
the expense of corporate
success, reading about
these companies proved
to me just how vital and
possible it is, for sustain-
ability to become deeply
integrated into business,
where it has the potential
to influence society on a
much larger scale than we
can imagine. By tackling
environmental problems
on both a societal and
individual level, we can
all aspire to build a more
sustainable economy. I
would highly recommend
this to anyone interested
in business management
or sustainability.

FRIENDs for life
U
Upon arrival
to FRIEND
animal sanc-
tuary, we
were greeted by the loud
clucks of chickens and
the turning heads of cows.
We made our way through
the muddy terrain to an
open field, where we were
welcomed by Dave, who
was a full-time volunteer
at the sanctuary. Behind
him followed Ging whose
puppy eyes gleamed with
excitement at the sight of
a big group of visitors.
The early start did not
seem to have taken its toll
on anyone, and just like
Ging, we were all hyped
for the day ahead.
We started by assisting
the sanctuary with its
daily chores; trainers were
exchanged for wellington
boots, and backpacks for
shovels and spades. My
small group started by
wheelbarrowing fresh hay
to the cow shed. Distribut-
ing hay amongst the cows
was slightly daunting at
first, but the mighty cows
were incredibly tranquil
and undisturbed by our
presence. Some were
even quite playful; they
approached us, eager for
a pat on the head or to be
showered with confetti of
hay.
Overall, the volun-
teering work was very
minimal, as there was a
huge group of visitors on
the day. By noon, we were
free to just spend time
with the animals. It was
lunch time for the pigs,
and their diet is surprising
to say the least. From
big trays, we grabbed
avocados, bananas,
melons and pineapples
and fed them to the pigs.
Donated by supermarkets,
the fruits were either
slightly past shelf life or
didn’t fit EU standards
and would have otherwise
been dumped in landfills.
The pigs smashed open
the melons with forceful
bites, and they gobbled
down the bananas and
avocados. Once they
were satiated, they each
tottered back to their own
paddock and went back to
sleep (relatable).
Clouds cleared briefly
and we were blessed with
warm sunshine as we fed
tangerines to the cows
who would extend their
tongues and swiftly sweep
the fruit from your palm.
If you weren’t quick to
retract your hand, you
may feel the sharp graze
of the rough tongue of the
cows. The cows had fur
that felt like velvet, and
they each had their own
unique mop of hair.
‘FRIEND was estab-
lished in 1994, when its
founder Marion bought
a disabled lamb at a
livestock market. She
then decided all animals
that came would have a
life of peaceful existence
for the rest of their days.
Today FRIEND Farm
Animal Sanctuary is run
with a vegan philosophy
of education about animal
welfare and the need for a
world of compassion to all
its inhabitants, fauna and
flora alike. As well as ed-
ucating visitors about the
animals, we are working
to make the sanctuary an
example of ecological

Environmental society hosts a visit to an animal sanctuary
sustainability, for example
planting native trees and
growing food as part of a
permaculture design.’
‘Our mission is to offer
sanctuary to unwanted,
neglected and abused
animals, while educating
about animals, veganism
and ecological sustaina-
bility. We hope to contrib-
ute to a world in which
humans and animals
can live in a mutually
sustained environment
through practices like
vegan organic permacul-
ture farming systems.’
Most of the animals
at FRIEND were either
rescued from horrific
living conditions or from
slaughter. Animals are
definitely capable of
suffering in the same way
as humans. They have a
central nervous system,
meaning that they have the
capability to suffer. Pigs
are more intelligent than
dogs and human babies,
so if people believe that
dogs and babies can suffer
then pigs can too. Since it
was my first time being so
close to pigs, chickens or
cows, it was very moving
to see them live so happily
at the sanctuary. For the
first time, I truly saw the
animals as affectionate
individuals. Each had
their own personality,
and it is difficult to think
that they could have been
chopped up and served
up on a dinner plate. The
experience at FRIEND is
a touching memory that
I will cherish, and I hope
someday to return and see
the animals.
