London, one of the
top ten universities in
the world, one would
expect to be faced with
many opportunities take
advantage of, perhaps
even more so as a Busi-
ness School student.
However, the Global
Case Competition was
not one I had expected
upon arrival, back in
September 2018, as part
of the MSc in Innova-
tion, Entrepreneurship
and Management.
This programme is the
third Master's degree I
am pursuing, after being
enrolled in a Master's in
Business Law from La
Sorbonne in Paris as well
as an MSc in Management
from a French grande
école called EMLyon
Business School. As a
former entrepreneur in
the first years of my un-
dergraduate law studies, I
have always been interest-
ed in solving today's dig-
ital-related strategy issues
and this cross-curricular
background resulted in a
six-month digital strategy
consulting internship at
Capgemini Consulting
(now called Capgemini
Invent) in Paris. Even
though I declined my pe-
nultimate-round interview
at McKinsey London to
start a full-time position
at Facebook Europe upon
graduation and, after
experiencing an amazing
summer internship there, I
have never stopped enjoy-
ing strategic case-solving;
quite the contrary.
Fun fact: I actually
heard about the Global
Case Competition on
Facebook. For those
unaware of such business
games, the concept is the
following: gather the best
students from the world's
best universities to try and
solve whatever kind of
corporate strategy cases
they are given. Hence,
the GCC is one of the
most prestigious contests
hosted by Cambridge
Consulting Network and
ETH Zurich's Graduate
Consulting Club every
year at the University of
Cambridge's St John's
College. Participants are
required to form a team
of four in order to apply.
Most of them are ideally
selected among their
university's consulting
club members so that
each team stands the best
chance of taking the top
spot.
Fun fact number two:
I decided to take a shot at
the competition the day
before the deadline, which
means forming a team was
quite a challenge in itself,
not to mention that I was
not part of any consulting
club at Imperial. However,
the MSc programme I am
enrolled in is all about
innovating, therefore I
could not miss such an
opportunity to apply con-
cepts in the field.
my closest classmates,
Edward Vernon, who I
had been working with
since October as part of
our course's group work.
I noticed his very strong
business acumen on
top of his flawless team
playing skills along the
way, which made him an
obvious partner in such
a challenge. He told me
about another classmate
Simon Jensen, with whom
Edward used to practice
consulting case studies for
interviews, making him
a solid addition. Finally,
we were missing only
one member to complete
the team, and I thought of
another fellow Business
School student, Charles
Jalali-Farhani, who is
pursuing an MSc in Eco-
nomics and Strategy for
Business. As President of
Imperial's venture capital
society, he previously
reached out to me in De-
cember to help him create
communication media to
raise awareness about a
VC Talks event gathering
some of the world's best
VC firms such as Accel.
Again, I noted his sharp
mind and collaborative
attitude when it came to
working together on busi-
ness-related topics. He
also used to practice con-
sulting case studies during
his BSc in Economics at
LSE. I felt he could be
the right match for our
team and he immediately
accepted my offer to join.
Even though we were
now a proper team, the
online application portal
still required our team's
name. Considering that
the "Fabulous Four" and
the "Fantastic Four" had
already been taken by
quite successful squads
in the past, we needed to
come up with something
else. Then I remembered
one of the coolest words
I had read, thanks to my
McKinsey buddy Nas
Andriopoulos, Imperial
alumnus and former
President of the Union:

rial students are known).
round of the competition,
all teams were required
to feature whatever rec-
ommendation they came
up with in a maximum of
four slides. Needless to
say, the 2-hour challenge
felt quite tricky for an
11-page case. On top of it,
we were not supposed to
present our conclusions,
which meant our entire
thinking process had to fit
into these four slides.
Beyond the sole
hurdles of the case, we
were immediately struck
by the devastating effects
of these hard time con-
straints. None of us had
any specific knowledge
of such a niche market,
which led us to analyse
the case for about half an
hour before even starting
to discuss it together. We
then struggled to settle
on an efficient structure
which could be both clear
and extensive. It took us
about another hour to get
to this point, while we
still had not yet started
producing any content.

“I decided
to take a
shot at the
competition
the day before
the deadline”
As some of you may have
guessed at this stage of the
story, this is how we ended
up officially applying as
"The Imperialites".
The competition started
on Saturday, 12th
January.
During the afternoon, all
the teams were required
to work on a case about
the healthcare industry.
We had two hours in order
to make a recommenda-
tion about whether an
Argentina-based medical
hardware manufacturer
called Conexia should
enter the U.S. market or
not. Their main product
was a real-time claims
adjudication system
which consisted of an IT
solution allowing health
insurance companies to
pre-authorise medical
services before they are
rendered to patients by
doctors. Even though
Conexia was a strong
leader in Argentina, the
U.S. healthcare system
was different and far more
fragmented than its do-
mestic market. During this
As soon as we agreed
on content, there were
only 15 minutes left to
design our presentation's
layout, which translated
into hardly anything.
Witnessing the flawless
workflow of some of the
world's best talent around
us was not helping either.
In a nutshell, we ended the
day not convinced of our
deliverable at all, quite
disappointed with our
overall performance.
Nevertheless, we did
not get that much time to
process or improve what
we had done, given that
one of the best parts of
the weekend was about to
happen. Indeed, all teams
were invited to attend
a private formal dinner
held in the Great Hall of
St John's College. It was
a great opportunity to
network and engage in
friendly conversations
with the different teams
and participants, as well
as staff and jury members,
in an incredible place.
Our team got to talk with
one of the two Cambridge
teams as well as the ETH
Zurich team, made up of
brilliant Engineering PhD
students who seemed to
be enjoying the moment
as much as we were.
Getting involved in such
intelligent discussions
with bright minds from
all over the world, while
being surrounded by
centuries-old historical
paintings, almost felt like
a scene straight out of
Harry Potter. Thereafter,
we headed towards St
John's College Bar where
we shared a few drinks
before going back home
in order to get in shape for
the next day.
Before starting work on a
new case, the staff made
us aware of Saturday's
general ranking. Suffice
to say, we were expecting
the worst, which hap-
pened. Overall, we earned
the second lowest grade.
However, none of us gave
up aiming for the top three.
Such a mindset was all the
more important in light of
Sunday's rules - Sunday's
score would count twice
as much as Saturday's
towards the final average
score. This is because
teams were allocated
three hours instead of
two in order to solve the
case, before introducing
their recommendations to
the jury with an 8-minute
presentation followed
by a Q&A session in the
afternoon.
Sunday's case was
about WorldLabs, a
London-based startup
developing an online
platform that connects
the innovation ecosys-
tem's stakeholders in
order to foster innovative
ideas through funding,
resources, collaborations
and support. The ven-
ture's management was
looking to scale both
their customer base and
funding. Thanks to the
hardships our team went
through the day before,
we immediately agreed
on a splittable structure
such that each of us could
work separately while
providing content which
could be directly featured
in the presentation that
I had started working
on just 15 minutes after
the round had begun.
Although we felt more
familiar with such an

innovation-related case,
our refined approach to
communication, produc-
tivity and time-efficiency

quality of what we deliv-
ered as a team. We then

first one would prevent
us from taking anything
beyond the third spot. This
is why our hopes were
dashed when that third
spot was awarded to the
ETH Zurich team, which
had already been brilliant-
ly ranked first following
Saturday's round. Further
to this announcement, the
pressure became increas-
ingly difficult to take as
second prize was awarded
to another team composed
of Master of Engineering
students from Imperial
College London, who de-
livered tremendous work
throughout the weekend.
Then came the an-
nouncement of the com-
petition's overall winners.
It would be an under-
statement in the extreme
to say that we were not
expecting to hear our
team's name, nor did we
overflow with happiness
after realising we had won
first prize. I especially felt
like I achieved one of my
oldest and most rewarding
dreams. A dream which
started fulfilling itself
with my admission to
Imperial. I would like to
extend heartfelt thanks to
my teammates Edward,
Charles and Simon for
their stellar contribu-
tion, both in terms of
quantitative processing
abilities and emotional
intelligence, their trust
in my endeavour as well
as the enlightening and
unforgettable human
experience we have been
through as a team.
In retrospect, I assume
that our story shed an
even brighter light on
Imperial College Business
School's motto: "Imperial
means intelligent busi-
ness". It strengthened
what I already believed
in as well as what we are
constantly provided with
in class. Sometimes, the
most cliché catchwords
are also the most genuine,
especially when it comes
to competing for success
globally: never give up on
your goals, ramp up your
strengths while overcom-
ing your weaknesses. At
the end of our journey,
we were honoured to
represent Imperial with
such values in mind, and
even prouder to be able
make our university stand
out thanks to the spirit it
fosters every day.
Despite such starting
conditions and several
withdrawals from poten-
tial teammates due to the
limited availability of stu-
dents around mid-January,
I was lucky enough to get
full support from one of
