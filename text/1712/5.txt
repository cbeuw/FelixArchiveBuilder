Les Gilets Jaunes: protesters or extremists?
Xiu Xiuchen argues that whilst the gilets jaunes began as a protest against fuel taxes, it has
mutated into an extremist movement

T
he yellow vest
(gilets jaunes)
movement began
in November
2018 and was named after
the high-vis jackets worn
by motorists who started
the movement. Although
the gilets jaunes started by
protesting against rising
fuel taxes, the movement
has become increasingly
extreme with the manifes-
tation of anti-government
sentiments. To fully un-
derstand the evolution
of the movement, we
must take a closer look
at events that have led to
the current state of affairs.
The first major protest on
November 17th saw large
scale barricades of roads.
The protests attracted
over 300,000 people and
caused major chaos. By
21st November there
had been 585 civilian
injuries and two deaths,
which lead to President
Macron deploying troops
to combat the violence.
The gilets jaunes has no
official organisation, no
identified leader and no
political affiliation, so just
how did the movement
become such a threat to
the French government?
It all began initially
with a single online
petition to lower fuel
taxes launched in May by
Priscillia Ludosky. The
petition quickly gained
great momentum, and by
mid-October it had over
300,000 signatures (and
now has over 1 million
signatures). The anti-fuel
tax petition resonated
with middle- and work-
ing-class motorists in
France, especially as there
were impending further
fuel tax rises proposed by
role. The idea for a
national blockade was
launched by Éric Drouet
and Bruno Lefevre
through the creation of
a Facebook event. Also,
around this period, a
viral video was posted
by Ghislain Coutard
which proposed the
use of high-vis jackets
during the protests, the
yellow vest has since
then become the symbol
of this movement.
Another important viral
video was by Jacline
Mourad who criticised
Macron’s policies as
they favoured the rich.
The video resonated with
the people of France,
as many believed the
environmental duties
are placed unfairly upon
them as the problems
were caused by big co-
operation’s.
Following the initial
protest, increasingly
violent protests ensued.
On 24th of November,
protesters set fires in
the streets of Paris, and
police started using
tear gas to deter the
protesters . By the be-
ginning of December, an
antiMacron protest was
organised, marking the
beginning of the change
from anti-fuel tax to
more anti-governmental
protests. More than
widespread support in
France (polls found that
70% of French people
supported the gilets
jaunes). The influence of
the gilets jaunes has also
spread internationally,
with similar protests
occurring in multiple
countries including

100 cars were burned
on 1st December, and
the protests resulted in
the death of a second
motorist and an elderly
Algerian woman. The
estimated property
damage was 3-4 million
Euro.
By 4th December, the
proposed tax rises were
suspended. However,
the protests contin-
ued, as the anger with
Macron’s pro-business
policies spread like
wildfire. Right now, the
gilets jaunes crisis is
becoming increasingly
difficult for the govern-
ment to deal with, as the
movement has gained
Canada, Russia, and
Croatia.
The situation in
France is also worrying
as the movement is
slowly being high-
jacked by anarchists
and extremists. Indeed,
a poll has shown that
many protesters had
either not voted or voted
for far-right or far-left
candidates during the
2017 presidential elec-
tions, and it is clear that
many of the protests are
insurrectionist in nature.
The future of France is
shrouded in uncertainty
as the protests continue;
will the government
regain its stability or
will the country spiral
further into chaos.
