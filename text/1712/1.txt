What the hell are the SACAs?

And why do they
matter?

Y
ou’ve been
s p a m m e d
with too
many emails,
you’ve seen the green
posters, flyers and tri-
angular table things in
the cafes. Maybe you’ve
grabbed a free tea or
green apple at one of the
stalls or seen someone
running around in a
ridiculous green morph
suit. All just to grab
your attention and tell
you to nominate a mem-
ber of staff for a Student
Academic Choice Award
(SACA). What’s it all
for and why should you
care? The short answer:
this is how we change
Imperial. You spending
5 minutes of your time to
submit a nomination can
make all the difference.
Don’t believe me? Let’s
see if I can convince
you.
Surveys like SOLE,
the SES, NSS, PTES and
PRES (the major student
surveys run at Imperial)
make it all too easy to
complain about what
needs to improve. And we
love to make it abundantly
clear (trust me, I’ve read
through the comments
and seen how brutal
students can be). Have
you ever thought about
how hard it must be to
read through hundreds of
negative comments about
you, multiple times per
year? I work with these
staff every day, it’s part
of what I do as Deputy
President (Education),
and I can tell you that it
gets demoralising. Even
our best staff that try their
hardest to deliver the
best possible experience
get worn down. There’s
no mention of that time
when they stayed two
extra hours to help
someone work through a
difficult problem. Nobody
has acknowledged that
they reply to emails or
mark dozens of pieces
of coursework over the
weekend when they
should be spending time
with their families. All of
that is too easily forgot-
ten. Giving your honest
feedback is extremely
important, but it’s only
half of the solution.

This is where the
SACAs come in. The
SACAs are a simple,
powerful way of recog-
nising all the hard work
that staff put in to make
our experience just a little
bit better. By praising the
staff that go the extra mile,
