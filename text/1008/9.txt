"Concerned" of Tunbridge Wells, on the demise of Beit

The Beit
Squad?
Dear Sir,
Despite only being an Imperial
student for one fortnight so far, I
read with considerable outrage the
plans currently under discussion for
the Beit Quad ("Confidential Drift",
Felix 1007).
Whilst not particularly caring
where the Union is situated, I nev-
ertheless feel that the Beit Quad
should remain for student/student-
related use. The article suggested
that the use of Beit Quad for con-
ferences would boost their atten-
dance, owing to its picturesque
aspect. Are the students deemed
unable to appreciate the Beit Quad
and worthy only of the architectural
finesse of Sherfield? It cannot be
justified, students having to hand
over their quad to conference dele-
gates who would appreciate for all
of three days. Moreover, to re-iter-
ate the article the largest room in
the quad holds three hundred,
surely inappropriate for conference
needs. Since conference atten-
dance needs "revitalising" that is,
they are not a pressing issue, will
not Southside suffice?
We read of an "expected influx"
of students in forthcoming years
and of the associated acute lack of
space to house them. In this light,
it is outrageous for the College
administration to consider convert-
ing the quad into accommodation
for delegates during vacations in
the main. With which party do the
administrators' allegiances lie?
The student body, or filling the
finance departments coffers?

To for the letter Catharine, but I
think you're getting a bit wound up
over not much - this isn't going to
happen for ages, if it happens at all.
And refurbishing Beit Halls for vaca-
tion visitors would almost certainly
be welcomed by all residents, pre-
sent and future. Just ask them!
Baggie Thanks
Dear Felix,
Rag would like to thank every-
one who took part in Monopoly
and Tiddlywinks. Special thanks to
those on Jez and Clem, Ian, Dan,
Dave, Richard and Steve for driving
minibuses, and everybody who
helped count money and Sam
Scotcher for keeping Monopoly
running smoothly.
We would also like to thank the
A-Z map company and Wadding-
ton's Games for donating prizes.
Ian Robertson, Tim Atkinson
(Rag Chair, Rag Treasurer)
Geez guys, I'm outta breath -
haven't either of you heard of full
stops?

Dear Owain,
It is sadly not unusual or even
undesirable for papers to print
provocative stories that are only
tenuously rooted in truth. Reality is
so much more mundane than
"imaginative" reporters would have
us believe. We should not there-
fore be surprised at Rebecca
Mileham's report (FELIX:
7/10/94) on the incipient dangers
of Dramsoc to the academic health
of the fragile Imperial student.
However, what sits rather more
uncomfortably is the masquerading
of what seems a rather distasteful
and virulent personal offensive as a
piece of objective journalism.
Surely we are presented with
something more suited to the
colourful regions of an opinions
page. Opinions are often pro-
posed with maximum zeal and
minimum qualification; they're nur-
tured on half-truths, as it is only
their half that interests them. And
the intrepid Miss Mileham certainly
wastes little of her precious time
burrowing for a balance, that
would be sweaty, arduous work
and one might arrive at rather dif-
ferent conclusions from those that
made this noble endeavour possi-
ble. For instance, I would be
greatfully enlightened (and not a
little surprised!) if she could identify
this whispering chorus of disap-
proval that "cite" and "raise
doubts" about the commitment that
Dramsoc "demands (!)" of it's
members.
We should recognise that the
problems of motivation in acade-
mic are not Society specific, but
specific to the individual.
Mercifully, priorities cannot be pre-
scribed and each one of us may
make of our time at university what
we choose; Miss Mileham would
probably call this dissipation, I
rather like to think of it as an
essential freedom.
The activities of the Dramatic
Society are moulded by the enthu-
siasms of it's members. One can-
not be dictated to in amateur the-
atre, PERSAUSION is the ruling
principle of any successful project!
It is a miscalculation, damaging
to the integrity of your publication,
to represent malicious rumour as
truth...or was this just Feline mis-
chievousness?!
Yours sincerely,
Iqbal Khan
Dramsoc President
Iqbal, Iqbal, Iqbal - what precise
malicious rumours did this article
propagate? Did you not fail your
second year? Did the article not
have quotes from an ex-president to
the effect that DramSoc commit-
ments caused him no academic
problems? Face it - you're repeat-
ing 'cos you didn't put the work in.
I should know, 'cos I'm doing the
same thing - but I'm not blaming
FELIX for it.
Get a Life...
Dear Poon,
It strikes me that your ignorant
attitudes need educating. Rather
than randomly abusing your
President, perhaps you should
direct yoiur comments at the per-
son that actually kicked you out.
Having suffered approximately
twenty minutes of your pathetic
and offensively unoriginal whinge-
ing, I personally felt that your pres-
ence in Beit Quad lowered the
standard of the whole event. As
you would know, if you had a life,
any other venue in London would
have charged you more and kicked
you further.
For future reference, your
removal was instigated by the
manager of the week's events,
NOT the President. Also, if you
expect to be welcomed at any late
night bar, attitudes that take the
piss are not to be recommended.
The Double-Six Club is a great
night out for anyone with a sense
of humour and bar extensions have
to be paid for. Personally, I
thought the action we took was
totally reasonable. Blaggers never
get very far.
I look forward to further abuse,
Fiona
Biology 3
Way to go, Fiona! To be honest
Ambrose, I'm surprised they put up
with you for as long as they did. As
for the apparent case of mistaken
identity - let me help: L-U-C-Y spells
"Lucy", and F-l-O-N-A spells Fiona.
NowG-O A-W-A-Y.
Tim says...
All the letters on this page were
typed exactly as they were written -
spelling, punctuation and grammat-
ical errors and all. This is apparenly
policy now, so if you don't want to
look stupid, make sure you check
through any letters before you sub-
mit them. Also, we'll give the letters
a title if you don't. A few more
paragraphs per page would help us
when typing them out, too.
By the way, Anna Ley of
BiologyZ WHERE ARE YOU? We
wanted to print your response to
Glyph, 'cos it's much funnier than
Helen's was, but you haven't turned
up to verify authorship yet....
