NEW WORLD
ORDER
Last year China, the largest
remaining communist country, had
the highest economic growth in the
world. This seemed quite surprising
especially since the Soviet Union
and its satellite states proved that
communism did not work. The
boom in China should be attrib-
uted to its reformist leader and
elder statesman Deng Xiaoping,
who turned 90 this summer. In
recent years Mr. Deng has retired
from his official posts and China-
watchers have maintained a death
watch, expecting his imminent
demise to set in motion political
transition and perhaps disorder.
Some expect the sort of vicious
fractional conflict over succession
that is typical of communist states,
leading to the fall of the
Communist Party. In its place some
see the emergence of democracy,
others forecast a military takeover.
For yet others, a breakup of China
seems imminent.
They are all mistaken. China
is different from the Soviet Union
in many respects. There are many
reasons to suspect that China's
present party leadership, headed
by party chief Jiang Zemin, will
prevail in a post-Deng era. First, it
has pursued an aggressive policy
of economic reform. These include
key institutional changes such as
banking and fiscal reform and
revamping China's foreign trade
system. Secondly, the resurgence
of economic reforms since the
beginning of the decade suggest
an unusual degree of agreement
amongst the leadership. A close
analysis of the seven member
Politburo Standing Committee
(China's main ruling body) can
clearly demonstrate this: six of the
seven members are reformers.
Third, with the exception of Deng
Xiaoping, the party elders whose
quarrels seemed to dominate poli-
tics in the 1980s are a declining
force. Death has already taken a
toll on their ranks. Four of the
eight key leaders died in the last
two years, all of them conservative.
In short, China's leaders
comprise an activist leadership that
is not weak, fragmented and wait-
ing for Mr. Deng's passing or its
own demise. The communist
regime indeed faces daunting
problems of transforming China's
economic system and governing a
rapidly changing society. China will
not see a decline such as the Soviet
Union has experienced, but is
more likely to thrive and prosper
becoming one of the world's lead-
ing economic powers. The
Communist Party is going to
become the sole party in a one-
party state, where economic free-
dom will be universal and political
freedom non-existent.
