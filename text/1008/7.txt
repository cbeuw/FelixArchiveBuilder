The S-Files' first: mega-interview. Six women from across the undergraduate spectrum gave tes-
timony: Michelle Cole and Barbara Wensing from Biology II, Sam Nagaitis from Chemistry I,
Cathy Harris from Computing I, Heather Turner from Civ.Eng.Ill, and Sarah White, Geology
with Engineering Geology III. How do undergrad female techs feel about Imperial? Is it stale and
sexist or switched on and sexy? Decide for yourself. Stay tuned for our Staff/PG followup special later this year.
Why did you do
Science/Engineering?
Michelle: I wanted to do
Are IC academics sexist?
Michelle: Overall I think
biology. It, was the only thing
I really ever wanted to do. My
outlook on science in general is
that there are a lot of boring peo-
ple in it. I think they can't show
their real selves for some reason.
• S H Barbara: I think science is
iHI really interesting. If someone
came up to me and said science is
dull and uninteresting, I would
beat them up! Some people think
science, is ...really really difficult,
but I don't think so.
ISam: I just do what I find
easy...I think, yea, I'd like to
be a scientist, wearing a white coat,
in a lab, finding cures and things.
Cathy: I wanted to be doing
something hi-tech. Industry
seemed unexciting and unap- /WL
pealing, whereas computers M
are the future...
i Heather: I did some
' that in Biology, everything's
okay, but occasionally...the male
lecturers will look on you as com-
plete and utter bimbos, some-
times, especially in practicals,
where its easy, not to make a mis-
take, but for things to go wrong.
S Cathy: They seem to be
making a conscious effort,
although sometimes they take
things too far. 10 for effort.
BHeather: On the whole,
they ve treated us exactly
the same as the boys. I'd give
them 8 or 9 for trying.
Sarah: Its not. that the RSM
WMm i s anti-female, as much as its
pro-male. There's almost, a macho
Civil Engineering work
experience at school. People
seemed to enjoy what they
were doing, and it seemed
interesting.
Em Sarah: I always knew
Si would be doing Science
My dad's an engineer. I'm not sure
if I'm going to stay in science,
though. I have to decide whether
I'm going to stick with it. or pursue
a musical career instead...
Are male students sexist?
Michelle: When I first start-
ed, I thought the boys were
looking at me, but now I think I
was just being over-sensitive.
• S B ! Barbara: Biology seems
mi okay, but I think its differ-
ent in engineering. I think you'd
be more in the spotlight. I've never
experienced sexism in the college,
but I think there must be some. I
think its not so much that people
are sexist, as that people want to
show others how smart they are.
Sam: I'm used to being one
girl in a crowd of boys. I
guess guys are sexist. They do try
to wind me up, but I don't let it
effect me, really.
B H Cathy: They give us a lot. of
attention because obviously
there are so few of us - maybe too
much attention sometimes. They
don't have any real respect, for us,
.e.g. my swipe card didn't work
initially. These guys had to grab it
and try it for themselves before
they would believe me. Most of
the girls I meet are feeling the
same way and feel we should
you know put out a united
front and face the sexist guys.
[rm Sarah: When I first came
EH to the RSM, I was very
intimidated by all the guys in
the class, most, of whom were
rugby, beer-drinking types. I
guess we've learnt not to take
much rubbish from anyone any-
more. I am the RSM women's offi-
cer, so I guess I'll be dealing with
these issues all the time now.

Do you think you have any
advantages over the guys?
Cathy: Boys... have their
own thoughts and they
believe them, and they're not,
willing to look at anything else.
Heather: 1 think I look at
the wider context of a prob-
lem, I don't just solve the equa-
tion and see what the end result,
is. I think I am a more divergent
thinker, rather than convergent. I
think that if you're doing a pro-
ject, you've got to be able to look
at. everything, whereas the boys
tend to look at one specific thing.
0 9 Sarah: We tend to think
• M i round problems, rather than
confront them head on...We tend
to think of everything rather than
just focus down on one part like
guys do.
