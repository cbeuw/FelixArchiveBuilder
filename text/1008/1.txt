A hacker broke into Imperial
College's computer network and
froth here caused disruption to the
Finnish University computer net-
work, it, emerged this week.
During the summer a hacker
from the United States managed
to gain access to computers run
by Imperial's Centre for
Computing Services (CCS). Via
the internet, an international net-
work of computers, the invader
was able to disrupt, Finland's
main University computer net-
work. It was only once Finnish
authorities rang Imperial that the
problem was chased and solved.
The computer, located in the
Department of Biochemistry, was
broken into permitting the hacker
to become a 'superuser'. As 'supe-
ruser' the hacker could bypass all
security mechanisms on the
machine. "They could tell it to
blow it's own mind away," said
Sean Bennett of the Department
of Computing. "This fault is one
that is used time and time again
by hackers to mess with the inter-
net." (Continues on page 3)

Senior academics at. the.
Department, of Mineral Resources
Engineering (MRE) have called
for further discussions over a plan
to rename the department. Earth
Resources Engineering has
emerged as the favourite choice
for a new name, after discussions
between college officials.
The change has been mooted
following a letter from the
Professor John Archer, Pro-
Rector, which asks for comments
on the new title. Professor Archer,
said that he has received only one
negative response to his letter,
and claimed that most of the
department's staff agree with the
proposal. But Professor Archer
said discussions are continuing -
despite the publication of an offi-
cial college note which says the
change will take place "shortly".
Professor Archer defended
the plans to change the name of
MRE, insisting that the change
would improve the image of the
department, and 'incorporate a
philosophical redefinition' to
reflect the 'flagship courses' the
department has been running for
two years.
One of the Department's
staff, Professor Shaw, Dean of the
RSM, pointed out that the pro-
posal has not. been adequately
discussed with students. He sug-
gested that the issue should be
debated by the Staff-Student
committee. It was emphasised
that most of the staff were away
when Professor Archer's letter
was issued, and that although a
change had been discussed the
benefits of the proposal had not.
been adequately debated.
Professor Shaw said the name of
the Department itself does not
overly matter, and said he was,
"a believer in tradition". Professor
Shaw would not say if he sup-
ported the name change proposal.
However, the new head of
MRE, and Dean of the newly
established Graduate School of
the Environment, Professor
Woods, is believed to think the
proposal is a 'great idea'. His role
as Dean will be to coordinate the
departments of Imperial, and to
present the benefits for research
of the college in line with a review
completed in May by Sir John
Mason.
The other two RSM depart-
ments may also change names.
The college's chief decision mak-
ing body, the Management
Planning Group (MPG), has sug-
gested a change in name for the
Geology department. The MPG
has not. specified a name but
Earth Sciences seems to be the
most likely name, though
Geological Sciences has also been
suggested.
A decision on this has not yet
been made, and the proposal
would officially be discussed at
the next. Staff meeting. Professor
Worthington, Head of the
Department, of Geology, said
there was a general feeling that
the Department's name is a bit
outdated, but insisted that if there
is disagreement he has no inten-
tion of forcing the proposal. If
approved, any change would be
made on the same time scale as
that for MRE, taking effect from
