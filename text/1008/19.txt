early '80s punk
Music used to be impolite. It didn't
say 'thank you' and 'please'. It
didn't say much at all, it just kicked
you in the stomach and stole your
wallet. But that was punk and this is
now. And now we're post-modern.
It's something that the John
spencer blues explosion appear
to have understood. Their new
album, 'orange' comes in lower
case characters on a shiny silver
cover of marketing purity. Inside is
a coiled stream of immediacy. Put
it on and you're prepared for action
as jon shrieks out and cuts in to
action.
So is it Blues? Not the
traditional sort 'cos history's dead.
No, this is post-modern blues in the
same way that Come are; intense
with all the right riffing but
seemingly little content. But if you
want some self-referential
treatment, get a load of the 'blues X
man' complete with Tom Waites
backgrounds vocals and slashing
chord structures. A fashion
statement? Swing out with
'bellbottoms'.
Of course this isn't really a
problem, 'orange' is a young album,
which is as full of swaggering rock as
instrumental wit as nervous energy.
The first time you let it go, Whammm,
it's a (9). Equally significant is when
this sort of classic album is reduced to
an (8) by any play thereafter. (8)
Start listening to Motocaster's
second album, 'Stay Loaded', and
you'd be forgiven for thinking that
this was merely a good excuse to
play songs influenced by cult guitar
bands.
'The Buddha' sounds like The
Fall with balls, while 'The Habit'
builds on a riff taken from the Jesus
Lizard school book. That's
something Motocaster should
definitely kick since as the album
progresses too many of the songs
suffer from the, 'Oh, they're going
to ram a single, filthy riff down my
throat' prediction. Still it's quite
interesting listening, what with the
Nirvana-style harmonies on
'Uranus' and the metallic jam of
'Motorolla Blues'. But they'll have to
plunder a bit more effectively next
time if they're going to rise above
the glut of power-chord laden,
American trios doing the rounds at
the moment. Third time lucky? (6)
It will be umpteenth time lucky
for German band Die Toten
Hosen, if they break through in this
country with their stop-gap, mini-
album, 'Put Your Money Where Your
Mouth Is'. They're trying their best,
mind, mixing melodic punk
('Lovesong'), Midnight Oil-style
socio-political anthems ('My Land')
and out-and-out mod ('Long way
from Liverpool'). Unfortunately the
guitars and drums are mixed way
too low to allow for any real bite,
but they have a sense of humour
and this should see them going
down a storm when they tour with
those japesters, Terrorvision. (6)
So it goes. Freshers' Balls must
be mass-produced to ensure the
maximum amount of tedium,
guaranteed every time. It doesn't
matter where they are, they all
have the same identikit stink of
cheap bear, cheaper thrills and the
obligatory bargain-basement lust.
Fun-da-mental's onslaught of
right-on rap did its best to keep us
interested, but they were always on
to a loser. They got up; they got
down; they wriggled around while
they were down (the kids looked
politely interested). They sweated
and screamed; threw in musical
influences with wild abandon and
generally rapped their PC little
I hearts out.
The problem, you see, is that
live Fun-da-mental are distinctly
average. They're so earnest that
you really want them to be better,
: but like so many rap acts, they
promise a twenty-dollar smile but
only ever give you spare change. 0
