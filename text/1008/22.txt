IC 1st vs UCL 1st
The first quarter was close with
both teams eager to make a good
start. However UCL began to pull
away, taking advantage of our
lack of experience in playing
together, and soon established a
good lead.
Despite IC winning the last
quarter and keeping a positive
attitude right to the end, UCL
went on to win the match.
With many first and second
team fixtures coming up, we look
forward to seeing any keen
players at practices, Thursday 12
- 2pm on the netball court next to
Linstead Hall.

ICWAFC vs ua
As per usual, the Dribblers were
short of players, by two this time,
having been let down by four
ladies. Never the less, we went out
on the pitch hungry for goals.
Neither team scored for
about 30 minutes, until a
deflection off our right, back's
knee went passed our keeper,
who was new to the job.
We held up very well in the.
second half, putting the pressure
on them, but unfortunately
missed several chances. Despite
soine excellent defending, they
scored 4 more goals. Late, in the,
second half, Erica ran up the left
wing, beat their keeper and put.
the ball in the back of the net. We
managed to gain a few free kicks
and corners, but, they didn't pay
off.
Thanks to all who played,
100% effort!

It. was with high expectations diat
IC made the long trip to play
UCL on Saturday and we were
not to be disappointed. After 10
minutes, IC's superior skill and
determination led to our first, goal
of die match. Decoy runs by the
full-backs Ben Willis and Rich
Craig left the opportunity for Wai
Kwok to send an inch-perfect
cross to Tim Lewis who headed
the ball Shearer-like past the
helpless keeper. Some strange
refereeing led to Mike Jarvis
stripping on the touchline,
however the last, laugh was with
Mike as the Ref felt, distinctly
under-endowed. After 10 minutes
of more possession football, we
felt it. was time to extend our lead
and after a Giggs-like sliney (?! -
Ed.) by Ike Ombala, he found
himself in space 25 yards out, and
sent a spectacular curling shot
into the top right corner: two -
nil. A third goal came soon after
when Tim Lewis again headed
the ball home after a delightful
cross from Bill "Kebab".
The second half consisted of
the IC back four soaking up
pressure and die midfield and
attack breaking regularly to try to
increase the lead. Some dreadful
finishing by Wai and Bill only
stopped them. Hopes are now
high for IC in both the UAU and
the League.

For the second week running we
couldn't, quite put. a performance
good enough to win a UAU group
match. Conceding two tries in
each half, IC could only manage
two scores of their own in the last,
quarter of an hour.
Christophe Sugden powered
his way over from a metre out,
after some good work by the
pack. The second IC try came
courtesy of Mark Wishart after a
scintillating run by Aled Bowen.
Unfortunately this was not
enough and IC succumbed by the
margin of 22-12.
I'm the brand new Sports Editor
for F E L I X . The idea, for this
year, is to have one page in every
issue dedicated to die sport results
for the week. Because results
which are one week out, of date
are of less interest, the sport teams
will be operating to a different,
deadline than for those submitting
articles. The sport page will be
done on the Wednesday evening
to go into the issue 2 days later.
This means that current results
can be reported. It also means
that I need to be certain that I will
be given enough material to fill a
page as by then most, of F E L I X
is already printed and there is no
margin for change.
As you can see, there are 2
parts in the page:
One part is presented as a
table with the results. Hopefully,
we will get all the results, for all
teams in all sports played
during the week. This hasn't, been
the case this week, but, thanks to
all those who have given us their
results. I hope that more teams
will do so next week. All that I
need is a phone call on
Wednesday evening (before 8pm,
so that 1 can finish the page before
3am!) telling us your sport:, team,
opponent's team and the score.
For those wondering about the
order the teams appear in the
table, this is how they are
arranged: The winning IC teams
alphabetical approach is used.
The other part contains the
reports of the matches. These
refer to the results in the table.
This means that, the reports for
those who play on Wednesdays
have to be given in the same day!
Those playing earlier in the week
have a bit more time but I still
need the articles by Wednesday
evening (before 8pm). The length
of the reports will have to depend
on how many I receive.
I know that I'm not giving
much time for people to write up,
but, I'm afraid this is the price to
pay in order to get up to date
results printed. I also need to be
100% confident that I will have
enough materials to get a full page
done by the end of Wednesday (I
won't be writing such a big
editorial every week, so I need
more articles!). If it is not. the
case, then that will be the end of
the Sports Page. It, is not easy to
get a page done at. the last minute
and it requires a lot of
organisation.
If you've got any comment, or
want to ask anything, come and
see me in F E L I X or just leave a
message if I'm not, in.
