B B C Radio is launching its third nationwide search for
young writers, so if you've got something to say and you're
aged between 16 and 30, here's your chance to have it
broadcast. FIRST BITE goes on air in September 1995 with
up to 20 plays and a selection of stories. BBC Radio 4 produces
and broadcasts over 400 plays a year to a daily audience that
would fill the Royal National Theatre for a whole year.
And for the 1995 festival, for the first time, Radio I FM
is linking up with its own special category.
We want original radio plays and stories
from writers aged 16 to 30
You could be part of the BBC Young Writers' Festival in September 1995
For more information and an entry form please send a SAE to
Room 620, BBC Broadcasting House, London W I A IAA
Closing date January 3 Ist 1995
