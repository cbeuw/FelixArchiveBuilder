Playtime: A ragster and friend during Monopoly

A two student crime wave was
stopped in its tracks when a hap-
less duo found themselves locked
inside the Department of
Electrical and Electronic
Engineering department last
Saturday.
The youths, from Warwick
University and the University of
Westminster had to call security
when locks supposed to keep
them out kept them in instead.
The two were so hopelessly lost
that they had to describe their
surroundings to college staff
before they could get out.
When security searched their
bags, the department's signing-in
book, and an assortment of mail
taken from the post-graduate
pigeon holes were recovered. The
students arc being dealt with by
their own University disciplinary
proceedures. Terry Brilcy, Deputy
Head of Security, commenting on
the event, stressed the need for
identification before holding open
swipe-card doors for strangers.
In another incident last
Saturday, brass plates outside the
Union Building were stolen.

Rag Collectors have been
blamed for the disappearances
which occurred during a Rag
party. The party had been organ-
ised by Mencap to thank the Rag
Collectors that had travelled from
all around the country to London
to participate in the IC Rag
Monopoly.
The ICU sign was removed
from the front wall of the union
security lodge. The lodge is
manned 24 hours a day.
One theft was foiled by a
Union Steward. At approximately
11.40pm the steward noticed that
the ICU doormat, which is usually
sited in the entrance doorway of
the Union Building, had been
taken. Following a patrol the mat
was located and locked away in
the Union Office for safekeeping.
It. is estimated that around 1200
people attended the party. The
Union has discussed the thefts
with Mencap. Lucy Chotia, ICU
President emphasised that they
were not taking the idea of charg-
ing the charity 'lightly' but, added
that, the sign 'obviously had to be
replaced.'
Souvenir stealing by
'Raggies' is fairly common on
these excursions and IC Rag
Chairman Ian Robertson admit-
ted, "We've not been totally inno-
cent of it in the past!."
Medics Give RCS Problems
BY ANDY SINIIARAY
The Royal College of Science's
vintage fire engine, affectionately
known as Jcz, may be evicted
from her present garage if plans
to replace the old Chemistry
building go ahead.
Although plans lor the
replacement of the building with
a new Biomedical Centre have
not yet, been officially approved,
the RCS Union and its Motor
Club have expressed concern
about, the demise of the building,
in which the RCS Union office is
also based. In interviews with
F E L I X , Mr Jon Turner of the
RCS Motor Club and the Mr-
Charlie Bell, President of the
RCSU both said that nothing def-
inite had been heard. They added
that, any movement of the fire
engine away from the College site
would deny many students the
opportunity to work on Jez in
their spare time.
Jez was donated to the stu-
dents of the RCS in 1955 for
what was described as her 'edu-
cational value'. Mr Turner said,
"She's been kept going since - by
students and ex-students, most of
whom work for engineering firms.
She commands that, much loyal-
ty...she really is a labour of love,
and she's very pretty. She's not
called Jezebel for nothing. People
get involved with the motor club
and end up devoting half their
lives to her."
He added that Jez could not
be simply put 'anywhere', as tool
space and maintenance facilities
are required. The present garage
is located directly beneath the
RCSU office, and was specially
extended to accomodate the vin-
tage vehicle. The official presi-
dential transport of the RCSU, Jez
has already been present, at the
Fresher's Fair, the RAG
Tiddlywinks and was even used
as the jail van in the RAG
Monopoly last. Saturday. Jez will
also be going to Brighton in
November with Bo', City &
Guilds' veteran car.
There is concern too over the
potential fate of the RCSU office.
However, the Imperial College
Director of Estates, Mr Ian
Caldwell, assured F E L I X that
he is "sensitive to the needs of the
Union". He added that though
the current priority was to obtain
official approval from the Higher
Education Funding Council and
the Department of Health for the
new building, the RCS would be
consulted in January. No work
would begin until next summer at.
the earliest. "But. we've got. a
responsibility to house them
somewhere," he said.
