The hacker managed to shut-
down part of the Finnish equiva-
lent of Britain's JANct system by
stopping all e-mail reaching it. It
caused the Finnish network to
disappear off of the computer
map and is known by computer
experts as, 'a major denial of ser-
vice attack'. The problem was
traced by a Finnish user who
reported this breach of security. A
high level Finnish authority then
contacted Imperial College to ask
what, was going on. It is claimed
by Professor Hynds, Mead of the
CCS, that the CCS have, "man-
aged to make sure that nothing
like that, will happen again."
However, when asked about
whether improvements had been
made, Mr Bennet replied: "None
what so ever as far as I am con-
cerned, no actions have been
taken." Currently the present, sys-
tem is vulnerable to anyone who
has a workstation on the internet
and knows the name of the local
network.
The experienced hacker,
known in computer circles as an
'Ubercracker', 'nuked' the system
which means that they sent pack-
ets of information to a machine
on the network. The machine at
the receiving end in Finland, act-
ing as a nucleus for the university
network, contained a bug that
can be manipulated to make the
machine stop 'talking' to die net-
work.
Currently all of the college's
Unix based computers, except,
those maintained by the
Department of Computing are
running a system that, is extreme-
ly easy to break into. The
Department of Computing uses a
system called Kerberos diat is far
more difficult to break into. It is
not completely safe but. anyone
wishing to break into a
'Kerberosed' system would need a
long time to do it. and know
exactly what they were doing. It
improves security by providing
extra protection on passwords
that move around the various sys-
tems. "Basically, it makes things
many times more secure than it
currently is, and the College
ought, to be using Kerberos now,"
said Bill Sharp, computing sup-
port, at St, Mary's.

October 1995, it would show that
the department wants to be
involved in the new Graduate
School.
Professor Worthington said
the change would only be of
'marginal help' in the Research
Assessment Exercise which the
department will undergo next
year in its bid to get a Grade 5
rating, this would give the depart-
ment more research money. The
rating is seen as being vital to the
financial well being of the depart-
ment. Prof Worthington admitted
that they were still not balancing
their accounts, but with new lec-

At (he Mind's Edge
My brother recently bad a motor
cycle accident, which left, him with
pins in his shoulder, left leg and
right foot and, in addition, some
very strange dreams. We were dis-
cussing general anaesthetics and I,
a veteran of two operations, men-
tioned that the last, time I had one
I was looking into the assistant's
beautiful blue eyes as she counted
down (1 giddy with gas and a mild
infatuation) and I wondered why
she stopped at 'seven'. "The oper-
ation is over," she replied and I
spent a lazy narcotic afternoon
puncturing the hours with brief
islands of consciousness. My
brother, however, seems to have
suffered rather badly. He speaks
of hallucinations and tortured
nights.
"I was in this woods, talking
to a strange monk in an iron
mask. I lay there for hours and it
was only the hospital bed that
gave it away: that I was dream-
ing." Aid: "there was this space-
man next to my bed all night. I
kept screaming at him to go away
but he just sat there. All night..."
And, slightly comically I confess,
he spent the Friday after the third
operation fervent in the belief that,
he was an 'aircraft door'. He told
me, quite genuinely, that, he was
surprised to be in hospital with all
these other doors — since when did
doors go to hospital? And why
would a nurse call a door by its
News In Brief
BY PETER LANIGAN, IAN DAVEY AND RACHEL WALTERS
Union Disciplinary
Two students have been banned
from the Union Building after a
disturbance during Fresher's
Week.
The incident occurred inside
the Union Building on the night, of
the casino and the hypnotism
show. It resulted in the involve-
ment, of security and Union
Stewards.
The students, undergraduates
in the Departments of
Mathematics and Mineral
Resources Engineering, appeared
before a disciplinary committee
shortly after the incident.
Dan Look, Deputy Union
President (Finance & Services),
said that the matter was being
treated as personal and would not
reveal any names. He declined to
comment further. It is believed
that the students had been drink-
ing heavily, and that the incident
happened towards the end of the
evening.
Women's Problems
In a new initiative for the female
population of Imperial College,
security's women staff have
undergone training by the
Metropolitan Police in dealing
with victims of sexual harassment,
and assault. Women make up
10% of the staff, which will enable
at least two to be on duty at each
shift.
tureships and the additional
£200,000 per year that a Grade 5
rating automatically generates, it
would make a balanced budget
possible.
In the case of Materials, the
third department of the RSM,
discussions are taking place for a
name which would better reflect
its activities. Professor Maclean,
the head of Materials, has insisted
that a change is not imminent,
and would be for 'marketing's
sake' rather than to reflect any
philosophical change. He
emphasised that undergraduate
courses would continue, and
pointed out that his is the biggest
Materials department in the
country. "Rumours of our death
are greatly exaggerated," he
joked, insisting that Materials will
continue to exist, as a separate
department.

What, lies behind the brain,
beneath those neurones and deep
in the heart of nothingness or
soul? I sometimes wonder if there
is a part if the brain dedicated to
believing — some peoples convic-
tions seem so bizarre and irra-
tional even in daily life. I have a
theory thai, the much hyped virtu-
al reality will not come through
billion pixel displays, supercom-
puters or lasers writing directly on
to the retina but by tapping
straight, into this 'belief lobe'. After
all, LSD and even dreaming
appear to do just. that. But dien,
my reality always was virtual...
