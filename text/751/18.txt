Dan Writes
"We figured the only way to get
more men was to go on tour"
Ye Gods, is that His Latest Flame
talking? It is you know. And what's
more, one of'em dislocated her knee
dancing to a Prince record the other
week. Wacky times, a touch of
bubblegum pop, soul, country and
now a Housemartin (fellow label-
mates on 'Go! discs' records) makes
tea.
Let's talk about Girls. Or, rather
five girls and one boy. Let's talk
about the pride of Glasgow, His
Latest Flame; Jacqueline, Tricia,
Laura, Irene and Moira (on vocals
methinks).
Their first single, "Somebody's
Gonna Get Hurt", won critical and
public acclaim (Sounds said "Oh my
my, this IS living. His Latest Flame
are girls with a passion. Sweet soul
music pirouetting and tumbling,
'Hurt' is murderously good"). Can I
say more?
Well, yes, certainly, dears. Their
latest single was N.M.E. 'single of
the week' last week and is a heart-
felt rendering of life on the never-
never; 'Stop the Tide' is its name,
and 'tis great!
Now, the thing is - I've got to
admit this - it was only going to be
private viewing. I was just going to
sit in the Lounge, with a cigar or two
and a glass of whiskey say, and just
watch the pleasant scenery. But they
forced me to make it public. So, if
you must, come along, it's only
£ 1.50 to get in and see the best all girl
band since the Shangrila's strutted
their sophisticated (boom boom)
stuff! I'm wholly besotted!. P.S.
They are playing on Friday 31
October, in the Lounge; advance
tickets available from the Union.
DRAMSOC
ScabNite
Auditions
Anybody who's ever fancied doing
something not particularly serious,
pleeeze come to the ScabNite
auditions this Sunday at 2.00pm
(meet in the Dramsoc storeroom,
two and a half levels above the I.C.
Union Office) 'coz we need lotz of
enthusiastic and untalented people
to star in Dramsoc's two ScabNite
productions, both short little plays
that are absolootly non-serious.
Inexperience is a big advantage.

THIRD WORLD FIRST
Anti-Poverty Action
Next week the College Third World
First group is organising an Anti-
Poverty Action campaign. We will
be trying to see as many students as
possible to offer you the chance to
join the scheme.
So, what is "APA"? It is a scheme
which encourages its members to
think about the problems of the
poor, the Third World, Developing
Countries, the "South" or whatever
term you use to describe the other
part of an unequal world. Members
of the scheme pay 1% of their
income (about £t 1
term,
equivalent to about h<m a pint a
week in IC units) by bankers order.
This regular form of payment is
used to make it a commitment, not
an impulsive gesture which occurs
when a collecting box and your
conscience coincide.
Half of this money is paid to a
group of Charities of your choice;
generally these will be involved in a
range of long-term projects, not
emergency aid. The remainder is
spent on information for members
which includes a number of special
campaigns and a quarterly
magazine.
If you feel the Third World
deserves more thought and
commitment than listening to Band-
Aid or emptying your pockets
outside Sainsbury's demands, think
about it. We will be trying to see all
those in hall, but if you want to help
or we miss out, please contact us in
the Union Office.
JAZZ AND ROCK
Calling All Rockers
Maybe a lot of you don't know what
the Jazz and Rock club does or
stands for. Let me explain. The club
has a practice room equipped with a
PA, electric piano, drum machine
and microphone, for individuals
and groups to use. We also have
storage space for drum kits and
amplifiers.
Jazz and Rock are only two of the
styles that we cater for within the
club, so whatever your (non-
classical) taste, feel free to come
along on Tuesday or Thursday
lunchtime for a look, and if you're
interested you can sign up and join.
If you're interested in playing a
musical intrument, or you sing, your
standard doesn't matter. We are
particularly short of vocalists,
drummers and bass players. Visit us
soon, we are one floor up from the
Union Office, and remember the old
cliche: practice makes perfect.
RCSU
Do Not Pass Go
It was great to see you all turning
out again for the Monopoly last
Saturday, despite the horrible
weather. We don't have the totals
back from Mencap yet, but as soon
as we do they will be posted up on
your departmental noticeboards.
We've had several new ideas for
raising money in the next few weeks,
and then we launch ourselves into
Rag Week. The RCSU events this
year include the Beer Festival,
1,000,001 Darts, Smoking Concert
and other minor stunts - more about
those in a fortnight. For those
interested in statistics, we are about
one fifth of the way towards our Rag
target of £15,000. Not bad' in just
under a month.
In the coming week we've got two
more Freshers' Dinners; Physics on
Tuesday, followed by Chemistry on
Wednesday. If you still havn't got
your ticket, see your Dep Rep as
soon as possible, or come to the
RCSU Office in Southside.
Finally, RCSU have a new
"positive coffee outlook" in the
office. We have large amounts of
tea, coffee, milk, sugar and a few
biscuits on hand at all times to offer
you when you enter the Office. Now
you don't need an excuse to come
and see us: pop in anytime!
P.S. Don't forget the RCSU
motor club dinner on 31 October,
and the Cabaret in Human Rights
Week.
