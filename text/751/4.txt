Feature FELIX, Friday October 24th 1986 4
The 17 Per Cent Solution
UNDERGRADUATES.
Part 1 of a feature on
Women at Imperial
College. Below, "from the
left, are Sandra Dawson
(Women's Senior Tutor),
Wendy Renshaw (UG
Women's Officer), Mrs.
Ash, Jane Bowie (WIST),
The Boss, Sam
Chittenden (PG
Women's Officer).
My name is Wendy Redshaw. I am
the undergraduate Woman's
Officer. It is my job to take care of
the women in Imperial College
especially the first years who may be
finding the traumas of moving into
London, starting at college, being in
a male dominated environment etc.
just a bit too much to cope with. I
am a very approachable person and
you are welcome to come and see me
about anything at all; if you want to
discuss your course, your career,
what to wear to college,
contraception, life, the universe,
whatever...and if I can't help you
personally then I'll put you in touch
with someone who can. You will
probably catch me dashing around
the maths department at lecture
times, or at QT (Snack bar) or
Normans (Union Snack bar) at
lunch times (you can't miss me as
I've got white-blonde hair!)
Alternatively you can write to me
(don't forget to put your name and
department, though, if you need a
reply), Wendy Redshaw, Maths 3.
POSTGRADUATES
Sandra Dawson; Welfare and
Social needs
As College Tutor for Women I am
particularly concerned with the
welfare and social needs of women
students at Imperial College. I think
I have two main responsibilites.
Firstly on a personal level it is often
helpful for students to have
someone in college who is outside
the immediate sphere of their
academic and social life of whom
they can seek help and advice. In
this role I am always ready to see
students who think it maybe helpful
to talk to me about issues or
problems which arise in their life at
Imperial College.
Secondly and more broadly I am
concerned at the collective and
social level to contribute to the
development of a more stimulating
and enriching social environment
within the college in which all
students with widely different
interests and needs can flourish.
Why then you may say 'College
Tutor for Women?' Why put the
emphasis on women? The reason is
that members of minority groups -
and less than 20% of students at
Imperial are women - sometimes
find it difficult to create enough
momentum and get enough support
and resources to secure new
developments. This can be
especially difficult if there are strong
pressures within an established
culture to behave in particular ways,
which members of minority groups
may not want to follow. I want to
help develop more diversity and
balance in the ways students can
live. Traditionally at least, some
aspects of social life at Imperial
College have not generally been
highly rated by the outside world-
the image has been one of
compulsive masculinity. I would
like to support changes in both the
image and reality of life at Imperial
so that no sixth former â€” whether
male or female - is 'put off from
coming to Imperial by this
reputation. On the contrary one of
my objectives is to support moves
which will make the social and
cultural life at Imperial College a
positive attraction rather than a
'necessary evil' which is accepted
because of the benefits of a good
Imperial degree. I would like to help
to create an environment in
departments, in refectories, in bars,
in residences and in the unions, in
which all women students will feel as
much at ease as their male
counterparts.
One consequence of greater
diversity and balance of different
interests will I hope, be a feeling of
greater freedom for women students
to do and say things 'as women'
without fear of immediately
attracting, what I am told now,
seems to be an all too common
hostile reaction from other students.
I'm writing to all new women
students inviting them to meet with
me in groups so that they can let me
know the sorts of things they would
like to see developing within the
College. I hope students with more
experience of Imperial College will
also come to see me with any ideas
and suggestions which they think I
may be able to help.
If undergraduate women feel
themselves isolated at IC, the
problem is greatly magnified for
postgrads.
In many departments PG Women
are in tiny minorities and have little
contact amongst themselves. They
may find it hard to get involved in
social and union activities for lack of
people to go along with. Unlike
UG's, many PG's work almost
entirely on their own and often have
no female academics available to
discuss problems with and to act as
role models for those who had
thought to stay on in academia. For
a lot of PG women, college becomes
more or less a place simply to study
in.
This is a great loss as there is
much to be gained from contact
with others like ourselves. Simply
having other women to share
problems, ideas and experiences
with can make all the difference.
Women who are new to London or
to Britain can find willing guides to
life in the Metropolis. Those whose
extra-mural activities might
otherwise be confined to the family
can find some alternatives. We also
hope to break down some of the
barriers between different women in
the college (ie staff, PG's, and UG's)
to the mutual benefit of us all.
As postgraduate women's officer,
I see my job as basically 3-fold.
Firstly along with Sandra, being
some one to come to with any
problems to do with being a
postgraduate women. These may
include tutor problems, harassment
or plain isolation. Secondly,
organising events where women can
meet each other socially. Those in
the pipeline include a welcoming
event for new PG women and a
series of outings and open houses.
(Anyone wanting to volunteer to be
descended upon for a small
gathering greatly appreciated.)
Finally, and more generally,
working along with my colleagues
shown here and with your help (I
hope) to make IC a more pelasant
environment for women to be in,
thereby improving the numbers
applying to come here and staying
the course and so making this a
better place for everyone.
Hope to see you at WIST and our
various events,
Love Sam
