FELIX FELIX, Friday October 24th 1986 21
Firsts
Win
Four Out
of Four
IC 1st XI continued their fine start
to the season by making it 4 wins in 4
games, and the second league
victory. In the main it was a fine
display of passing football but, as
the scoreline suggests, defensive
lapses in concentration could prove
costly, particularly against better
teams.
IC got off to the worst possible
start by allowing KQC to take the
lead in the first minute. It took IC 30
minutes or so to take control, and
even then chances were squandered;
it seemed like it would be "one of
those days". Five minutes before
half time, however, Nigel Collier
equalised with a powerful left-foot
volley, after he had cleverly made
space for himself on the edge of the
KQC penalty area.
The second half started well as
skipper Alessandro Lunghi lashed
home a loose ball from 12 yards to
put IC in front. Nigel Collier
increased the lead as he ran onto
Dave Lynne's through ball and
chipped past the KQC goalkeeper.
IC now began to put on a show for
the watching fans as passing
movements bewildered the K Q C
midfield and defence, as chance
after chance came and went. K Q C
pulled one back 3 minutes from time
from a breakaway, but Alessandro
Lunghi restored the two goal
margin when a cross-cum-shot
curled into the top corner.
IC Fight Back
Hockey; IC 2nd XI 4, LSE 2nd XI 4
After waiting for the firsts to thrash
LSE, it soon became our turn to
compete. However our match was
not to be so one-sided due to our
lack of ability to control them when
necessary. The game started badly
when we conceded an early goal.
Whenever they broke through, they
seemed to do so with a 1 or 2 player
overlap, which made things really
difficult for the backs, who played
courageously to say the least.
However LSE were pushing players
forward most of the time, which
made them susceptible to attack
from our fantastic forwards. Both
wingers, Mike Foxcroft and
Duncan Fitter, played brilliantly,
taking the ball down the wings and
playing it in front ofthe goal several
times.
Our first goal, however, was
scored from a penalty flick, by Gary
Knairesborough. Somehow he sent
the goalkeeper the wrong way and
tricked it into the goal.
When half time came we were 4-2
down but we were more determined
than ever to win. We had controlled
the game so far and yet we were
losing.
In the second half they only came
close to scoring once, and even this
was dealt with by the backs and
outside halves. Dave Whitton, who
played right half, and attacked as
well as he defended, set Mike up
several times who, in turn, managed
to beat his opponent nearly every
time and got the vital cross in. With
5 minutes to go we equalised with
the score at 4-4. Andy Lewis and
Gary had scored 2 goals each by
now, partly due to excellent support
from Mark Powell.
The number of times we missed
the goal in that last five minutes was
unbelievable; the ball would not go
in. Losing Gary when he got a stick
in his eye didn't help much either.
Everybody had done their part by
the end, with the scores level at 4-4.1
am sure the 2nds will do very well
this year, both in the U.A.U. and the
Middlesex league.
Resounding Win
ICSC does it againâ€”2 weeks in
succession the intrepid sailors
conquer the opposition with a
resounding win.
It was down to Sam (Sam who?-
Ed), our captain, to demonstrate the
key tactics and from then on in it
was plain sailing in the match
against Portishead on Saturday.
However, in the afternoon, the
wind got up to a gusty force 4 and
one of the crew, who shall remain
nameless, found herself in the drink.
On top of it all Gareth found himself
mid-water without a main sheet
block. 2-boat team racing then
ensued while hasty repairs were
quickly carried out in the 3rd race.
This was again successful with
our new helms Adam and Richard
quickly learning the finer arts of
team racing. Adam and David
valiantly covered the rear allowing
Dan and Richard (Surnames!-Ed)
through to first position.
After a crew change, the final race
increased the winning margin; Ape
and Rebecca were first at the start
and at the finish, with team-mates
Gareth and Jeremy close behind.
A good day's sailing was had by
all, with some decent wind for the
first time this term. Hopefully ICSC
will do as well at the National Foot
Trophy next weekend.
IC Dominate
Rugby; IC 1st XV 22, LSE
1st XV 10;
This was the most important game
of the season so far, being the first
match of the U A U competition. IC
got off to a slow start with LSE
camping in the IC half for the first
10 minutes or so, but the IC defence
soaked up all the pressure that the
opposition could throw (!!-Ed), and
went up the pitch to score. The pack
took a while to get together
properly, but once they did they
dominated the forward play,
winning some good second-phase
possessions. The match ended in a
convincing IC win, which made up
somewhat for the matchbox sized
changing rooms! This match augers
well for the next U A U fixture
against Kent.
Flying Start
IC Hockey club have got off to a
flying start this year. In their
opening matches the 1st's slotted
five past a hopelessly outclassed U C
side, whilst the 2nds had a
comfortable 4-1 win.
The initial round of the U A U
competition saw the club pitted
against the LSE, who were reputed
to be very strong this year.
However, the lst's notched up
another five goals, and the Ladies
were just good enough to pip their
opponents by one goal. The seconds
displayed great character to come
back from a two goal deficit to level
the scores at 4-4 in a keenly
contested match.
Amongst all this success let's not
forget the stout hearted
performance of the 3rd XI. This
crack team of high class hatchet men
has played with vigour and
enthusiasm despite losing both their
matches this season. They have now
been forced to spend endless hours
in the bar planning new strategies
and tactics to defeat their
forthcoming opponents.
The - 1st XI have a testing week
ahead, with an indoor fixture on
Tuesday, a visit from Kent
University on Wednesday and a
Middlesex Cup draw on Thursday.
It's early days yet but the team looks
very sound and should enjoy some
degree of success during the year.
Anyone who is keen to play
hockey can contact the club via the
hockey noticeboard situated just
outside the Union Bar.
