Apologies for the lack of a new
puzzle in the last few weeks
FELIX's, what with the office
moving and printing problems,
there hasn't been enough space.
This week we've got a fiendish
crossword devised by Brunhilde.
As usual there's a £5 prize for a
randomly picked correct entry.
Answers, comments, new problems
etc by 1.00pm Wednesday, please.

3 o w n & O u t in London
laving run out of people to write
- u; :;ieir favourite pop groups,
• low move on to the London
dance scene.
'\; a good season for dance, with
h jic series of foreign companies
being Drought in— notably by the
Sadlers Wells Theatre. Last week
he Central Ballet of China gave a
jtnng of brilliant performances
nere: this week it's the Ballet
Gulbenkian, from Portugal.
- pparently they're much improved
"rorii •nen I last saw them, eight
tridusand miles and several years
away. Their best piece— Ghost
Dances, by Ballet Rambert's
hristopher Bruce— is set to South
Ameri an tolk music and is 'a
rimal Mend of myth and polities',
-mong several other Dance
I mbreiia events (for which you can
get voucners to save 20%onanyfive
:r.certs): at the Riverside Studios,
• ar Hammersmith, a rather more
mi-garde group— Compagnie
.s-Anae— combines classical
•\c, Indonesian (or Malay)
a _:an .r.usic and Parisian
imc ir with a choreography
• .v influenced by Pina Bausch.
:ra to imagine— Bausch seems
rather depressing and un-
glamourous to me— but it could be
an interesting evening.
The Dance Umbrella artist-in-
residence, Dana Reitz, will be at the
Institute of Contemporary Arts on
Friday and Saturday. She does an
hour-long 'Solo in Silence' which
should be very good watching,
especially if you've enjoyed the
similar pieces by the Ballet
Rambert.
To finish off— the Royal Ballet
this week present an evening of
Frederick Ashton pieces. 'The
Dream' (Midsummer Night
variety), the classically abstract
'Symphonic Variations', and high
drama in 'A Month in the Country'.
An enthralling programme, well
worth seeing. And some time in the
future, watch out for the
productions of the London
Contemporary Dance Theatre— you
can count on some interesting ideas
from them.
Well, I'll dispense with the usual
list of events culled from 'Time Out'
and leave the rest of this page blank.
You can look up the music and films
for yourselves.
