Reviews FELIX, Friday October 24th 1986 17

There can be few bands with
relatively little chart success that
could hope to fill the Royal Albert
Hall with an authentic capacity
audience, but Everything But The
Girl managed this on 14th October.
The concert was split into two
parts: during the first half Tracey
Thorn and Ben Watt were
accompanied by their usual band
and a jazz group, some of whom had
played on their first album 'Eden'.
This collection of intense, highly
personal songs is regarded as a
classic of lonely bedsitter land and
here they managed to reproduce its
jazz sound perfectly, especially with
'Each and Everyone'. There were
disappointingly few songs from the
album 'Love Not Money' but this
was compensated for by a number
of B sides and cover versions
including 'Night and Day'.
The second half consisted mainly
of songs from 'Baby The Stars Shine
Bright' but backing was no longer
provided by saxaphone, etc. but by a
large contingent from the London
Philharmonic Orchestra! The
sweeping strings and the clarity and
strength of Thorn and Watt's voices
complemented one another
perfectly, most notably in the cover
version of 'Always On My Mind'.
Everything But The Girl did not
make the mistake of simply scaling
up their light and sound system to
perform in the massive hall; they
produced a whole new show in
order to make the maximum use of
the acoustics. They started the
whole show with a simple duet
performance of 'Come On Home'
and finished off with the same
n u m b e r but d r a m a t i c a l l y
accompanied by the whdle of the
orchestra.
This was a show of variety,
i m a g i n a t i o n and supreme
Confidence. Thorn and Watt have
great stage presence and show all the
signs of true professionalism.
However they never fall into the
trap of taking themselves too
seriously, as witnessed by the Thorn
quip about using 'everything but the
kitchen sink'.
Everything But The Girl are a
band who have progressed a long
way in the last few years, their
versatility in musical styles and
sharp, truthful lyrics make them an
interesting band to watch out for in
the future. U z H o l f o r d
I doubt if any of you have noticed,
but so far this term, only one of the
books reviewed has been by a
women (Mary Renault's 'Fire From
Heaven'). But this week it's all
change and F E L I X proudly
presents two rather good books
from outstanding women writers.
My Antonia, by Willa Cather, is a
tale of pioneerning Americans who
left home, kin and kindred, to sail to
the land of opportunity. Antonia is
a Bohemian girl, the only one of her
family to speak English. Her
mother, ambitious for her son,
brought the family from Europe-her
father, pining and homesick, dies
soon after in s u s p i c i o u s
circumstances. The spirit of the
prarie, covered in red grass and
rattlesnakes, the winds and
blizzards, small-town gossip, comes
to life. Their is even a sense of
homecoming as her chronicler
returns from twenty years at
university, law school and the Big
City to find Antonia, surrounded by
Far from the horrors of Gaston
Leroux's 1911 novel and Universal
Pictures' 1925 movie, Andrew
Lloyd Webber's latest show, 'The
Phantom Of The Opera' (Her
Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket) is a
tame though entertaining spectacle.
It is set in the Paris Opera House
and concerns a disfigured
phantom's attempt at gaining the
affections of a young Soprano,
Christine (Sarah Brightman). The
plot is complicated by rehearsals for
'Don Juan Triumphant' and Tl
Mito' taking place at the opera
house. In pursuit of Christine's love
the phantom (a distinguished
performance from Michael
Crawford) interrupts rehearsals and
performs varied but unexciting
misdemeanours: for example,
sliding down through the theatre on
the infamous chandelier.
Brightman and Steve Barton, as
her aristocratic lover Raoul
Vicomte de Chagny, perform
credible demonstrations of song and
dance but The Phantom Of The
Opera's best assets are the special
effects. The stage is initially clad in
heavy velvet curtains and collapsed
backcloths but transforms
convincingly into a graveyard, an
underground labyrinth and a misty
lake. There are mystifying illusions
and many tricks under the
floorboards, the best of which are
the sprouting candlesticks (these
were greeted by rapturous applause
from the audience). For the
mechanically-minded the show's
programme gives a guide to the sub-
stage machinery i n c l u d i n g
counterweights, crab winches and
graphited oak fillets!
The show certainly entertains and
is worth queuing for athough it is
nearly fully booked until next year
and all those thousands of people
can't be wrong, can they?

her farm, barns, orchard and
(twelve!) children, but still with all
those shared memories. This book
may even help you understand the
melting pot of America-published
by Virgo, it costs £3.50.
Murder in the English
Department, by Valerie Miner, is
totally different-brash, modern and
with none of the gentle, reflective
nature of My Antonia.
A professor is killed whilst
attempting to rape a student, and
suspicion falls on one of his colleges,
Nan Weaver, a feminist, who has
been organising an anti-sexual
harrasment campaign. It all ends
happily ever after, though I suspect
in real life that it wouldn't, but at
least some interesting ethical
discussions come out of this book,
which is lively, tightly written and
with quite good character sketching.
It's published by The Womens
Press, costing £3.75, and it's also
available in the Haldane Library. In
case any of you need to know, the
College women's tutor is Susan
Dawson, phone 7015, and the
Union Womens Officer is Wendy
Renshaw. „ , _. ,

Venessa Redgrave as Mrs. Alving in
Ibsen's "Ghosts" at the Old Vic.
This production of Ibsen's Ghosts at
the Young Vic is a meticulous and
perfect presentation of life's circles:
The present and future are merely
points on a circumference that will
eventually be repeated.
Written just over one hundred
years ago, Ghosts deals with incest,
mother-son relationships, morality
and immortality with a sharp
realism that is matched by superby
performances throughout. The
action centres around two
contrasting characters; Mrs Alving
(Vanessa Redgrave) who represents
liberalism and change, and Pastor
Manders (Tom Wilkinson) whose
'moral majority' type of attitude is a
little too reminiscent of many public
figures today. His reactionary
statements against anything that
remotely threatens the family unit to
the status of men over women are
still naive and dangerous; 'It isn't a
wife's place to judge her husband'.
Ghosts appear to Mrs Alving in
deja vu experiences as she realises
that her son, Oswald is following in
his father's steps, despite never
having known him. Efforts made to
escape his evil patriarchal fate fail as
the 'sins of the father are visited on
the children'.
The Sun rises as the son dies.
David Thacker's Ghosts is too good
to be missed.
