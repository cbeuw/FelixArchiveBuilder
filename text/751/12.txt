The Choice
An in depth study of
what to look for in the
perfect employer
"How do I choose which employer
to apply to? They all seem much the
same. I'll apply to the seven largest,
most famous employers with the
most vacancies and that will
probably do."
It might work but, if you have
spent any time at all choosing what
occupation you wish to follow, it
seems a pity to mess up your future
happiness by failing to carry out
adequate research on your
prospective employer. There are five
Directories of Employers of
graduates. 'Register of Graduate
Employment and T r a i n i n g '
(ROGET); 'Graduate Employment
and Training' (GET); 'Graduate
Opportunities' (GO); 'Directory of
Opportunities' ( D O G ) and
'Directory of Opportunities in New
Technology' (DONT). These are a
good source for your preliminary
list of possible employers. Besides
outlining the vacancies that they
may have, they tell you about the
company's size, its location, its
recent graduates brought along to
Company presentations. A
company is unlikely to bring along
people who think it's a foul
company in which to work! So how
can you find out which company is
for you? Firstly you must know
what you want from an employer;
What sort of environment would
you enjoy?, what promotion
prospects or training would suit you
best?, do you want a very open,
friendly style of management or
would you prefer a more
conservative formal firm? The
Careers Fair is a good place to start.
You might ask them why they think
you should work for them rather
than for X and Co although don't
sound too arrogant when doing so!
Another valuable way of finding out
about different employers is at the
Old Students' Association and
Careers evening.
Once you have narrowed the field
of employers you can save everyone
an awful lot of time by checking
whether the companies actually
have vacancies in the areas for
which you are applying. Every year,
a well known computing company
is inundated with applications for
computer programming jobs. They
do have between 400 and 500
vacancies but not for computer
programmers.
pattern of employment and even a
little of its philosophy. Many
employers produce special
Graduate brochures which provide
profiles of recent graduate entrants
of the 'Day in the life of...' variety.
There are many videos for those
who prefer watching and listening to
reading. These can be viewed in the
Careers Video Room, key from
Sherfield Room 309. Although all
these sources will tell you something
of the companies, they are produced
and written by the employers
themselves and therefore are
unlikely to paint the companies in
anything other than glowing terms.
The same thing can be said of the
If the company is visiting the
campus during the Graduate
Recruitment programme then you
can obtain the application forms
from the Careers library. Otherwise
you will have to apply directly to the
company.
And finally, think about 'fall back
positions'. Please consider the
wisdom of only applying to the big,
glamourous, well-known compan-
ies. Every year on the Imperial
Graduate Recruitment Programme,
perfectly respectable companies
have to cancel their visits through
lack of applications. Think what it
would do to your chances of success
if you applied to such a company.
Applications
Books have been written on this
topic and so it is not particularly
easy to condense in.. aple of
hundred words or so. A good
application is absolutely crucial in
seeking any job—wu^ut it, you
have no chance of an interview, let
alone the job! The reason why most
applications fail is because they are
badly presented (illegible writing,
coffee-stains etc), ill thought-out
and poorly expressed. One
employer reported he had rejected
90% on those grounds. Perhaps
more typically an employer with
about 15 jobs might receive 700
applications and these would be
reduced to about 150 for the first
interview. Thus it really is
significant to get an interview.
What then is the 'secret'? Actually
there is no secret at all; just plain
common sense. So here then are a
few tips.
1 Think carefully about what kind
of job you want, identify possible
employers then read up about them
and their vacancies.
2 Follow the instructions on the
form carefully. If they say 'attach a
photograph and write in black ink'
then you cannot expect too much if
you do not send a photograph and
write in blue ink (as a depressing
number of applicants did for one
employer last year).
3 Work out in advance your answers
to the questions on the form.
4 Draft and edit your answers to fit
the spaces provided.
5 Answer all the questions. If one is
not really applicable to you, explain
why that is so and do not leave the
space blank.
6 Keep it all simple; keep a copy.
7 Try and view your application
from the employers' point of view.
Would you be impressed by the
answers? It is not likely that you
would be if there were broad
unsupported generalisations eg "I
can communicate well and get on
with people"—is the evidence
elsewhere on your form?
8 If you want more help/advice see
any of the Career Advisors. If also
after a few applications you haven't
been invited to an interview, come
and see us again.
Interviews
When called to interview, the
unspoken message from the
employer is that they like the look of
you on paper and so wish to meet
you to confirm that view. The
message from the invitation to the
second interview is that "having
checked you out, we'd now like to
give you the proper interview from
which we may make you an offer".
Thus the first interview, often
held in the College and certainly for
those employers listed in the G R
Programme is relatively short.
Much will consist of points in your
application—'tell me more about
that', 'why did you do this?',
'describe your project?'. In some
cases there may be a little technical
content. The interview is also a
chance for you to ask questions—so
have some prepared! In fact be
prepared all round—dress suitably,
arrive in good time, be friendly and
positive, look at your interviewer, be
prepared to smile, be honest—if you
don't know the answer to the
question, say so and don't waffle!
The second interview is normally
on the employers' premises. This
gives a special chance for you to
evaluate the employer (after all it is a
two way process)-does the place
seem a good one in which to work?,
are the employees friendly?, how are
recent graduates getting on?, etc.
The employers may have a variety of
tests for you to do—some use
psychometric tests, some use group
discussions—here the important
thing is not so much whether you get
the right answers to the problems
but how you deal with other people,
how you react under stress. Finally
there will be the interview itself, very
often before a board. Of course you
will be nervous but the confidence
that comes from a good preparation
can help a lot.
Once again the Careers Service
can be part of that preparation. We
are easy to find, easy to consult and
we are running a comprehensive
programme of talks and seminars;
we also have much literature. So if
you want any help, do come and see
us.
