Bolt From The Blue
• H I
RCSU Vice President Ms Judith Hackney was surprised to receive a
Tarzanagram at the RCS Ladies' lunch yesterday. The burly Tarzan threw Ms
Hackney, aged 21, over his shoulder and then attempted to leave. His way was
blocked by an angry mob of RCS ladies, who persuaded him to release their
officer. "I didn't know what had hit me. It was like a bolt from the blue," said
beautiful blonde Judith, blushing shyly.
We Are Here
The New FELIX office has now
been in operation for nearly two
weeks, though the old premises in
Beit archway have still not been
completely vacated. Last week's
issue was the first to be printed on
the Print Unit's new litho, a model
made by Ryobi. The new office can
be found at the foot of the west
staircase of the Union Building, on
the North side of Beit Quad. The
new site is a little out of the way, but
it is hoped that students will soon
get used to using the office in its new
location. Alternatively, you can
contact the office by phoning 3515.
