CHRISTMAS
COURSE
58JAN. 1987
SJ5 CI is offering a Christmas Vacation Course this
= year for final year undergraduates who
are reading Mechanical Engineering at University.
• This is a chance for you to discover the wide range
of engineering opportunities typically available within
a large industrial organisation, to work in syndicate
groups and develop your practical understanding and
to speak and work with engineers who are operating
in a wide variety of different fields and with different
levels of responsibility
• The ICI environment is a demanding one which is
driven by scientists and technologists from many
backgrounds but it is stimulating for open minded
engineers who are excited by change and the
implications for making sure that we continue to be
a world leader in the future.
• Are you up to the challenge? You do not have to be
a boffin but you do need to be an achiever, with a
positive attitude of mind and a record of competent
achievement!
• The Course will be based at the Blossoms Hotel
in Chester - naturally no charge will be made for
