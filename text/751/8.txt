Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday October 24th 1986 8
Christine: Safety First
Early last Sunday morning a
woman was attacked and raped in
the basement of one of the blocks of
flats leased by College in Hamlet
Gardens. It is appalling that it takes
an incident like this to bring to light
the lack of security -measures in
these student flats. Main doors from
the street are unlockable and in
some cases missing altogether, and
the dark unlit passages and
stairwells are perfect places for
intruders to lurk. By the time you
read this, something should have
been done about these defects; if
not, perhaps Hamlet Gardens
residents should demand alternative
accommodation until they feel safe
going to the telephone or to visit
friends in their own block.
Meanwhile there is little we can
do to help the situation apart from
offering commonsense advice to all
women; be alert at all times and
remember that rape alarms are now
available from the Union Office and
the Warden's flat in Hamlet
Gardens (121). It makes sense to
carry one all the time. Don't feel silly
asking somebody to go with you
even to the telephone, stick together,
and once locking main doors are
fitted, make sure they stay shut.
If you're ever stuck at College and
worried about getting home, don't
hesitate to call Jackie or myself
(internal 3512 or 3511 respectively),
the least we can do is find you a floor
to sleep on here. If you have to travel
alone, avoid dark streets and empty
train carriages, sit near the guard or
conductor and walk near the road to
avoid dark doorways. It is all
commonsense really, it's just
sickening that we do have to be so
alert and suspicious all the time. Do
come and see me if you think we can
do anything else or if you just want
to talk this over.
Whilst on the subject of security,
I've put " A L A R M " labels on the
red buttons in the cubicles in the
Union Building women's toilets.
Please try to avoid setting the alarm
off accidently or for no real reason,
the more false alarms there are, the
less people will react in a real
emergency. The same applies to
personal alarms, of course. If you're
ever in the Union Bar and hear a
loud siren, get up those stairs fast as
it means someone has pressed the
alarm in the womens toilets or the
Union office and needs help.
U G M
The next Union General Meeting is
on Tuesday, November 4 at 1.00pm
in the Great' Hall, Sherfield
building. There will be a speaker,
Derek Edwards, the Human Rights
Education Officer of Amnesty
International. There will also be a
collection for Amnesty. Routine
business will be kept as brief as
possible to give the speaker a fair
chance! If anyone does want to
submit a motion to the U G M , give it
to Dave Colley (Hon. Sec.) or Hugh
Southey ( U G M Chair) by
Thursday, October 30.

A small tapestry (approximately 10 inch by 12 inch) has been stolen from
the Exhibition on level 2 of the Sherfield Building. This tapestry was the
work of Valerie Kirk, whose name should be on the back.
If anyone has any information about the tapestry, please contact Dr
Hargreaves (3046) or Mr Reeves, College Security Officer (3371).

Insurance
Top Up
Take
Cover!
Hello one and all, it's me again and
my small rant. The main thing that
come to my attention is "Insurance
Top Up". All students who live in
College Accommodation, including
Head Tenancies, are covered for
upto a limit of £1,500 worth of
personal effects. There is however, a
iimit on certain items such as
collections, art pieces and gold items
of £150 per item. If you possess
goods that total more than £1,500
then come and see me in my office. I
then ring up the brokers and ask
them to quote me a premium, which
I then tell you. If you accept this,
you then write out a cheque for this
amount, made payable to
Alexander Stonehouse, and when SWv>ta»<
they receive the cheque, the cover is
started.
Also, while I'm on the technical
side of life: 1) Will all drivers of
Union vans please use the parking
places marked "College Vans
Only", as these are our new,
specially reserved, spots. They are
situated near the guards barrier by
the post office, please don't park
anywhere else. 2) Will all those who
have parking permits around the
Southside and Linstead area please
bring their parking permit in to me,
so I can change them for the correct
permits, which I have just received.
Now that's a l l the dull
administrative bit over, it leaves me
very little to say, except that in the
last issue of FELIX I received a bit
of a slagging off for upholding the
publicity rules. The rules are there to
be upheld, and if a society breaks the
rules I will take the persons or
society to the publicity tribunal
regardless of political persuasion.
This, I hope, clarifies anything that
Mr. Ranson said, and I hope that
openness of mind will be at the fore
in future cases.
One last note I would like to
make; I'm really pleased with the
change of atmosphere this year and
everybody seems to be out to
socialise as well as work. The Union
building is very well attended both
during the day and at night. For this
we must thank the increased services
of Kevin and Norman and their
crews of hard working people, and
also the efforts of Ents. Remember
that events and services are here for
you, so do make the most of them.
D.I. Colley
