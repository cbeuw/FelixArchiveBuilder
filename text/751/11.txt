Life After Imperial
Or: What do
we do now
Your last year and you haven't a
clue what to do next? Awful, isn't it;
perhaps if you forget about it, it
won't happen? Perhaps if you just
send off thousands of application
forms, someone will give you some
sort of a job which you might enjoy?
No, better just ignore the problem'.
No, I know, go and see the Careers
Advisors, they'll tell you what to do.
Unfortunately, we can't tell you
what to do, we can help you towards
the decision, point you in the right
direction to get you started, test out
whether you're being realistic but,
ultimately the decision is yours.
You're on your own on this one! So
where do you start? Well you could
stick a pin into every third page of
the Graduate Recruitment
programme booklet or you could
try to be a bit more systematic about
it, first of all, you could think about
it yourself, try to compile a list of
your characteristics, traits, your
values, what you want out of life and
your skills, what you're good at, not
forgetting of course those things
that interest you and that you enjoy.
Then, when you look at job
descriptions, you can compare them
with your personal profile and see
which ones match and hey presto,
you know what you want to do next.
How did I get here?
Trouble is, it's not so easy to
identify all these things about
yourself and so here are some tips as
to how you might go about it. Look
at your life so far. Why did you
come to Imperial, why. are you
reading Mathematics or Biology or
whatever? What have you enjoyed
of the experience, why, what have
you hated? Was there anything in
your holiday jobs that you found
fun or that you discovered you were
particularly good at?
How about leisure interests, any
clues there? If you can't do it this
way round try looking at the jobs
first. Read as many job descriptions
and adverts as you can and when
you spot one that takes your fancy,
try and analyse what it is that
attracts you and then you can look
for other occupations containing
these factors. Perhaps you've seen
or talked to people whose jobs seem
interesting. What was it about that
job? Your Careers Advisor can help
you with this task or analysing your
skills and needs by asking questions
and checking out whether you really
mean it when you say, for example ,
that all you care about is becoming a
millionaire by the time you're 30!
There are brief descriptions in the
back of the Directory, ROGET but
for more detailed descriptions,
consult the series of booklets
published by the Association of
Graduate Careers Advisory
Services, all available free of charge
from the Careers Library.
Fiendishly
Ingenious
If you find all this totally
impossible and your Careers
Advisor can't help you get started
on the trail then they may
recommend that you complete
Gradscope Questionaire which is a
fiendishly ingenious little toy. You
answer 50 questions and the
computer programme comes up
with the top ten jobs, but alas you've
still got to answer the questions
what are you good at, what do you
enjoy, what do you want to do next.
Have you enjoyed yourself' so
much as a student that you're
thinking of going on to take a
further qualification? There are
many reasons for continuing your
studies but merely having enjoyed
your undergraduate years may not
be an adequate motive. Being a
postgraduate may turn out to be
very different from being an
undergraduate. Are the elements of
your undergraduate life that you
have enjoyed still present at
postgraduate level?
Another pretty pathetic reason
for taking a further course is
because you can't think of anything
else to do or because this career
choice business is just too difficult.
What's going to make it easier to
think of something else, or to decide
after another year or three at
College? If you just continue to
study and take no active steps
toward the dreaded future, you'll
find yourself in exactly the same
dithering situation only slightly
older!
But mind, the worst reason of all
is falling prey to flattery. You may
feel that you're not susceptible but
come June, when your degree
results are out and notable
professors ask if you'd like to do a
PhD with them, it's easy to be
overwhelmed by the ideas, without
thinking out the reality. Should this
happen to you, beware false pride.
Beware, the professors have reasons
of their own for wanting PhD
students and before jumping on to a
three year project, weigh up the pros
and cons and analyse whether it's
really the right move for you.
Before you get the impression
that I am totally against
postgraduate studies, here are some
more positive reasons for this course
of action. You may simply not feel
finished with studying, the more you
want to learn. Perhaps there's a part
of your undergraduate course that
you have found particularly
interesting and would like to study
in depth. Many a masters course
caters for this need, eg Astrophysics.
The most obvious reason is
vocational. Your chosen career may
require a PhD or a further
qualification eg research in the
Pharmaceutical industry or
teaching. You may feel that it will be
easier to get a job in your chosen
field if you possess a further
qualification eg Geophysics or
Petroleum Engineering. You may
wish to change direction and
another course can often help eg
Information Technology. Another
word of caution is required here. It's
easy to be misled into believing a
course is more vocational than it
really is. Admission tutors are sure
to tell you how useful their courses
are and so make sure you ask what
percentage of their previous
scholars are in employement and
what they are doing. You might also
check out the value of your chosen
course with some of the employer at
the Careers Fair or discuss it with a
disinterested person like a Careers
Advisor.
Having made the decision to
prolong your student days, the
obvious next step is to decide where
you want to study. The Careers
office, Sherfield 309 keeps a
reference copy of, 'Graduate
Studies' which lists all the PhD and
Masters and many of the Diploma
courses available in the UK. We can
also point you in the right direction
for information on studying abroad.
The Lyon Playfair library has many
prospectuses and also keeps a copy
of the 'Directory of Research' in
British Universities and Poly-
technics which contains detailed
titles of PhD projects which have
been carried out recently. Of course,
you'll need to check whether you
can get the money for your studies
and whether you need any pre-
course experience. To be safe, you
should think about applying for
PhDs and Master's around
Christmas but for many vocational
courses like teaching, you should be
applying now. If you think that
there's the slightest chance of
wanting to continue your studies,
then apply. If you get an offer of a
place, you can always turn it down,
otherwise you may find yourself
having to wait a year because you
decide too late.

and analyse whether it's
really the right move for
you"
