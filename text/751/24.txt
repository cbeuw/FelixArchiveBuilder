Annual
Report
Rape In Hamlet
A 40 year old nurse was attacked in
a College residence in Hamlet
Gardens at 7.15 last Sunday
morning. She was walking to work
along Ravenscourt Park when she
was grabbed from behind, dragged
into the basement of one of the
blocks and raped.
Police arrived within an hour and
returned twice to question residents
further. A forensic expert examined
the basement for fingerprints. A
witness, who was taking
photographs nearby, was able to
give a full description of the man: he
is coloured, about 6ft tall, of slim
build, has short black hair and was
wearing a grey jogging suit with a
hood. Anyone who saw the man
before or after the attack should
contact Detective Inspector Phillip
Shepard at Hammersmith Police
Station (Tel 741 6071).
Following a meeting between the
college surveyor, Mr Peter
Hallworth, and the landlord's
representative, the landlord,
Strollmoor, has agreed to improve
security in the Hamlet Garden
residences. Doors will now be fitted
in those blocks where the main
entrance is open, and all main doors
will have locks and spring returns.
Entryphones are to be installed in all
the blocks, which will take about a
month, and the entryphone in the
block where the attack took place
will be repaired by the end of the
week. Lights in the stairwells will
also be checked more frequently.
Student Services Officer Don
Ferguson remarked that any
security system relies on students
being sensible, for instance outside
doors should be kept locked at all
times when not in use. There are no
open stairways in other residences,
he said, but people must always be
careful.
The Rector, Prof. Eric Ash, is very
concerned about the incident, but he
does not feel that Estates have been
lax about security and repairs. "It's
very easy to be wise after the event,"
he commented, adding that it was
certainly worth looking at security
arrangements in the other
residences. Improvements could be
made, but there will always be some
risks, he concluded.
Community
Chest
Over 120 students in fancy dress
participated in Human Monopoly
for Imperial College Charity Rag on
Saturday. Due to a great effort by
everyone who took part, £2304.97
was raised for Mencap. Individual
totals will be available soon, as will
the name of the winner.
Ghostbusters, Martini men with
treacle filled glasses, transvestites
and people with inflatable
'accessories' went round London,
armed only with an A to Z, a set of
clues and a Travelcard. Some very
strange items were acquired,
including parking tickets, pairs of
underpants, a wrenched crook-lock,
matches from the Savoy and even a
BBC film—all obtained legally of
course. Everyone who participated
enjoyed Monopoly, in spite of the
weather, and all were worn out at
the end of the day.
The evening concert was also a
resounding success, with over 1200
people turning up at Hammersmith
Town Hall. Although slightly
outnumbered by sixteen coach-
loads of Loughborough students,
IC was well represented and
incurred the wrath of everyone else
by making a virtual clean sweep of
all the raffle prizes.
Rag Chairman Man Tai Tseung
told FELIX that he would like to
thank Emma the Sagittarian guinea
pig, Martin, Carl, Robert, Robin,
Jonathan and Mehesh, and also
everyone who took part.
The Imperial College Annual
Report for 1986/6 was published
yesterday. The report was released
to coincide with the Commem-
oration Day ceremony. As was
expected, the publication is an
extreme departure from the
statistic—filled reports of recent
years. The new report has been
printed to a very high quality and
includes articles on the
administration, academic research
and undergraduate activities at IC,
as well as a brief statistical section.
The Annual Report has been
restyled to raise the profile of
Imperial College, and in particular
to promote links with industry.
ULU Bash
Several hundred people converged
on the U L U building in Malet Street
last friday for the U L U Intro All-
Nighter: "Unstoppable", sponsored
by Time Out and the National
Westminster Bank.
For £10.00 students were treated to
food, live bands with Terry and
Jerry, The Potato 5, The Sacred
Hearts and Sandie Shaw, as well as
several cabaret acts, most notably
Jenny Lecoat. After the bands, films
were shown until 8.00am next
morning including the Rocky
Horror Picture Show and Taxi
Driver.
