Ash Speaks Out
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash, attacked Government
policy on education in his Commemoration Day speech
yesterday. The UGC cut of more than 4% means that
key posts cannot be filled, despite the recent UGC review
having described most of the College's departments as
"outstanding". The Rector called for greater efficiency
and stressed the importance of attracting more funding
for research programmes, including collaborative
research, from both national and international sources.
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash,
attacked Government policy on
education in his Commemoration
Day speech yesterday. The UGC cut
of more than 4
% means that key
posts cannot be filled, despite the
recent UGC review having
described most of the College's
departments as "outstanding". The
Rector called for greater efficiency
and stressed the importance of
attracting more funding for research
programmes, including collabor-
ative research, from both national
and international sources.
During the past year, industry has
established a new chair in the
Computing Department, two
lectureships in Electrical
Engineering, and one in Physics.
The Mechanical Engineering
Department has also been able to
expand due to the Government's
"Engineering Technology
Programme", and this year
Electrical Engineering and
Computing will take part in the
programme. However, the money is
available strictly in proportion to
the number of extra students taken
on. Prof Ash welcomed the
Government's emphasis on applied
science and technology, provided
pure science does not suffer as a
result.
The Rector announced that two
IC lecturers have been elected to the
Royal College. Professor Emeritus
John Argyris was elected for his
work on the solution of complex
field problems usingfiniteelements,
and Prof Roy Anderson, who is
head of Pure and Applied Biology,
for his research into epidemiology.
He also congratulated Prof Sir
David Cox, who was knighted
recently in recognition of his
achievements in Statistics.
Prof Ash reported that the
proposed merger with St Mary's
Medical School is currently under
discussion. Preliminary studies have
shown that most staff and students
would be in favour ofsuch a merger,
and the Governing Bodies of both
establishments feel that it would
bring great academic advantages, he
added. Thefinaldecision should be
made by July 1987 and if the merger
goes ahead, it shold be completed
within two years.
Goodbye Rosemary
Rosemary Hosking, the FELIX
typesetter operator, is leaving IC
Union today after working at
Imperial for two years. Rosemary,
and her husband John are starting a
family and are expecting their first
child in January.
Since joining the FELIX staff
when David Rowe was Editor
(1984/85), Rosemary has done the
job of Print Unit receptionist as well
as that of typesetter operator. She
had to cope with three of the most
difficult editors there have been, as
well as a constant stream of helpless
dumb publicity officers. She has
managed to maintain a remarkably
cheerful disposition throughout her
time at FELIX despite the frequent
unreasonable demands made of her.
FELIX would like to thank
Rosemary for all her hard work over
the past two ye#rs, and to wish her
and John all the best for the future.
