Sharp At The Cards
Dear Dave,
Colin Palmer's article on Blackjack
in FELIX 750 seems especially
written to confirm his former
reputation as IC's biggest
bullshitter. He tells us 'Blackjack is
THE GAME for students of science
and technology', yet 'hunches play
an important part' and even 'a little
bit of ESP is a bonus'. ESP?!? Isn't
that a bit much, even coming from
you, Colin?
To summarise, gambling is fun,
but you must do your homework
first; there certainly isn't enough in
Colin's article to turn you into a
winner. Read Tulcea's book "A
Book on Casino Blackjack" (by far
the best available on the subject);
look up the article on computer
simulation in the June '85 issue of
Personal Computer World; go to
the Wellsoc lecture on Casino
Gambling planned for next term; or
write to me, if you like.
Uri Palmer then goes on to imply
that he wins consistently when he
plays, so it's rather suprising that he
gives nofigureson how much he has
or hasn't won. To remedy this, let
me quote the research of CI Tulcea,
a maths professor from Yale, who
asserts that the best players can win,
on average, 1.5% of their minimum
bet per hand, but to insure against a
run of bad luck they need to gamble
with a capital of at least 400 units.
This means that, if you are playing
for £1 stakes (the minimum in
Britain), you must have at least £400
you don't mind gambling with, and
your expected profit will be about
£1.50 per hour if you are one of the
best players in the world.
It's a pity Colin gives the impression
that winning is easy, because he is
right when he says casino
restaurants are excellent (they
subsidise the food from the
gambling to make sure you don't
leave because you're hungry) and
there are other perks he didn't
mention like free soft drinks -
though I doubt if Colin knows what
a soft drink is.
But if you're pinning your faith
on ESP, you'llfindbending forks a
lot easier.

On The
Cards
Dear Sir,
May I use your columns to clear up
an apparent misapprehension
concerning the new library
borrower cards? We have
discovered that many peope think
that the allocation of 4 book loans
from the Haldane Library forms
part of their entitlement from the
Lyon Playfair Library. This is not
so, but is a bonus in addition to them.
We have an excellent stock for
fiction and non-fiction, records,
tapes, music scores, newspapers,
journals and maps (mostly for loan)
which includes the Union Library. It
is available to all members of the
College. We have recently extended
our borrowing hours, and it is now
possible to borrow from all but the
Music Library in the evenings and
on Saturdays.
Yours Sincerely,
Richard G Williams.
Haldane Librarian.

Dear Dave,
I would like to take this opportunity
to warn your readers about the large
number of toilets that are appearing
all around College.

Paradise Lost
This year's annual report, released
yesterday, is very much the glossy
publicity brochure that had been
predicted. It is excellently
produced, expertly designed, and
unashamedly bland in its billing of
IC as a Utopian centre of
education. A few months ago a
collection of students, myself
included, was invited to contribute
their Opinions ofthe College. It was
quickly apparent that the company
commissioned to prepare the
brochure were not interested in any
viewpoint which fell short of
adulation. Fair enough, perhaps;
one would not expect a College
publication, which had been
targetted from the outset at
industry and parents of prospective
students to present a balanced
viewpoint. Nevertheless, the
ubiquitous flattery of the College is
not only laughable, but rather a
little distasteful to anyone who
knows IC well. If only the brochure
had addressed itself to some of the
problems faced by IC, it would
have made a far more respectable
review of an academic year.
