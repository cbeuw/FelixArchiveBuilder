Benefit U p d a t e
Welfare Advisor Lesley
Gillingham talks about
money.
Benefit update 1986/7: The New
System
Housing Benefit:
Housing Benefit was set up in 1983
to enable people on low incomes to
get help to pay rent and rates. Until
September 1st 1986, practically all
students paying a normal London
rent were eligible to apply for help
under this system, irrespective of
where they lived, unless at the
parental home.
On September 1st the regulations
concerning student claims for
Housing Benefit were changed.
There are three major changes to the
regulations:
a No student living in College owned
accommodation (Halls and Houses)
can claim Housing Benefit in term-
time or the two short vacations,
b The student income will now be
based on the full grant taken over 38
weeks, giving a total weekly income
of £59.10 for Undergraduate
students. Postgraduates should
divide their annual income by 52
weeks.
c There will be no reassessment over
the short vacation, whatever you
receive will be the same for the
whole academic year.
Simple Calculations:
1. Work out your 'Needs Allowance':
Single Person £48.10pw
Couple £70.85pw
Single Parent £70.85 pw
Each Dependent Child £14.60pw
2. Work out your gross weekly
income:
The Undergraduate student grant
works out at £59.10pw, of which
£17.10 is disregarded for rent (but
not rates) purposes, leaving £41.40.
3. Work out your weekly rent and
rates:
If your rent includes any amounts
for gas or electricity payments,
money will be deducted from your
rent for these. Maximum deductions
are approximately £7.00pw in total
for heating, lighting, cooking and
hot water.
Your rent will then be divided
into rent and rates. Rates are usually
taken to be 30% of your total rent,
unless specified.
To get the 'eligible' rent figure
you must deduct £17.70 from your
weekly rent. No deductions are
made for rate purposes.
4. Calculate your rebate:
If your income is equal to the needs
allowance:
Rent equals 60% of 'eligible' weekly
rent,
Rates equals 60% of weekly rates.
If your income is less than the needs
allowance:
Rent equals 60% of 'eligible' weekly
rent plus 25% of the difference
between income and the Needs
Allowance,
Rates equals 60% of the weekly rates
plus 8% of the difference between
income and the Needs Allowance
If your income is more than the Needs
Allowance:
Rent equals 60% of the 'eligible
weekly rent' minus 29% of the
difference between income and the
Needs Allowance,
Rates equals 60% of the 'eligible'
weekly rates minus 20% of the
difference between income and the
Needs Allowance.
Supplementary Benefit and
Unemployment Benefit
On the 1st September 1986 the
regulations concerning student
claims for supplementary Benefit
and Unemployment Benefit were
also amended.
Supplementary Benefit
Students can no longer claim
Supplementary Benefit in the two
short vacations. They can still claim
in the longer summer vacations.
Unemployment Benefit
As the 'period of study' is now
considered to be 38 weeks, students
are no longer 'available for work' in
the two short vacations. However, if
you fulfill the e l i g i b i l i t y
requirements you will still be able to
'sign on' over the summer.
Remember if you do have any
questions or experience difficulties
with benefits, call into Student
Services and see Lesley, the Welfare
Adviser, or call into the Union on
Wednesday afternoons.
