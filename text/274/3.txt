In the traditional IC
manner two candidates are
already emerging lor next
year's IC Presidency. It
would be invidious to
mention either by name, but
perhaps salutary if we were
to reflect — in a peculiarly
English way I hope they will
understand—on what makes
a President. Now good Presi-
dents are few and far between
whereas average ones are two
a penny (no pun intended).
Take the four Presidents this
year. Now Gwyn Hughes can
argue he was only a last-
minute stand-in, so to be fair
we will ignore him. I don't
think Barry Sullivan ever set
out to be other than a typical
Mines' President and this he
has succeeded in doing. By
sticking to his job, rather
than poking his nose else-
where, and by setting a
reasonable standard of re-
sponsibility he has won re-
spect outside Mines. It will
be good if constitutional
changes are accepted which
would leave Sullivan-type
Presidents freer from IC
politics and thus more able
by Les Ebdon
to do constituent college
work.
Egoism
When Dermott Corr and
Rex Lowin were elected to
their various posts, their sup-
porters expressed the hope
that they would be a new
type of President, with a
more democratic, less egoist,
outlook on the job. It is
probably the dwindling away
of this support from progres-
sives, which in recent weeks
has hardened into outright
opposition, that has left Der-
mott rather sensitively ex-
posed. Poor Dermott finds
himself in much the same
position as Harold Wilson,
distrusted by the right and
deserted by the left. The
reason has been the same—
a lack of courage in the face
of opposition both from
people and the system, a
failure to really prove he be-
lieves in what he once stood
for. The consequences have
been much the same — sensi-
tivity towards the Press
(hence Corr's obsession with
Felix; Wilson's with the
BBC), and of late Dermott's
rather unfortunate personal
antagonism towards people

Reds under beds
Time is fast running out
for Dermott Corr, if he is
to take the kind of courage-
ous stand of which we know
he is capable against the
"reds under the beds" scan-
dal-mongering at present pre-
valent in Guilds.
On the other hand, the
clock has only just started to
tick for IC President, Rex
Lowin. Destiny calls for Rex
Lowin — the constitutional
reform sub-committee, of
which he is a member, have
produced some progressive
and useful reforms for ICU.
Obviously at some stage or
other perplexed people will
doubt the wisdom of one or
two changes. This is when
Rex Lowin must emerge
from behind his Cigarella
smoke-screen and take a
courageous stand. Any Presi-
dent can conform to what
the Union in-crowd want; it
takes a brave one to stand
for what the Union needs but
it is guts that make a good
President.
Dunces hats
to sand
domes
At the Mines Union meet-
ing on Tuesday of last week
discussion ranged from
dunce's hats to sand domes.
Mines Hatted
The Honorary Pornog-
rapher proposed that to
maintain the dignity that
befits the office, the President
of Mines Union should wear
a top hat and the secretary
a bowler hat. Amendments
gave a cloth hat to the Vice-
President and a dunce's hat
to the Honorary Pornog-
rapher. The motion was car-
ried unanimously and all
should be seen wearing their
respective headgear from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. while in
College.
No Davy
An all-day symposium on
sand domes and mascots was
discussed. Barry Sullivan ad-
mitted they would never be
able to solve the clues for
Davy and also described the
sorry state of Clementine,
the Mines' vehicle. It was
suggested that a tank would
be more reliable but Barry
Sullivan deferred a decision
on changing Clementine until
later.
He announced the way
Mines voted in the referen-
dum: in favour of constituent
colleges, ICWA, the execu-
tive system and the sabbati-
cal year for the President of
ICU (this by one vote only);
but against NUS.
Horizon
Last term, a "Horizon"
team came to IC to get
material for a programme
they were producing — "The
Drift from Science". They
took film sequences of the
College, interviewed students
and filmed members of
Physics in lectures and in the
labs. Penny Clark, Gwyn
Hughes and John Spence
took part in a recorded dis-
cussion to provide sound
background for the film
sequences.
This is being screened on
BBC-2 at 9.35 p.m. today,
Thursday 6th March.
New Felix and Phoenix
editors will he elected at a
meeting on Wednesday 12th
March at 1 pm in the Union
Office. The Felix vacancy is
for next term and next year
and the Phoenix vacancy is
merely for next year. Anyone
interested in doing either of
these jobs for all or part of
these periods should attend.

You have enough
to worry about. So we don't

The biggest cloud on the horizon
for a student (apart from
examinations) is money. A grant

So Lloyds Bank doesn't ask for
