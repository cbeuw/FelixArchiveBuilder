Page 2 FELIX 6th March, 1969
Referendum voters say;
We want to elect our
Union Officials
The referendum held
on Monday 24th pro-
duced 1742 students wil-
ling to give their views
on the constitution and
approve or disapprove
of suggested changes.
Generally, they wanted
things as they are, with
the notable exceptions
of heavy majorities in
favour of the president
and secretary being elec-
ted by a vote throughout
the college, and for de-
partmental reps, being
on council.
As stated in the last
FELIX, a Union meeting was
held the Thursday before to
discuss the referendum, but
due to bad publicity only 40
people came, so it was can-
celled as being of little use in
informing the general student
body.
Despite receiving a favour-
able vote, the proposed Sab-
batical year of the President
will not be included in con-
stitutional amendments as set
out by the working party, but
will be treated as a separate
suggestion to the college
administration.
The recommended new
constitution was due to be
presented to council on Mon-
day 3rd March, and will sub-
sequently have to be passed
through two successive Union
meetings with a two-thirds
majority.
The chairman of the work-
ing party on the constitution,
Martin Bland, seemed satis-
fied with the reaction to the
referendum, but considered
that some of the questions
had been badly phrased and
should have been more
directly emphasised; in par-
ticular he thought that the
question on 1CWA should
have been phrased relative to
ICWA's elevated status as a
comparatively small IC club,
rather than the vague "Do
you believe "
Not many postgraduates
voted, surprisingly, but the
voting was not random, as
the results show, although a
publication of the voting held
in the RSM showed a reversal
on the Sabbatical year result.
In a letter to FELIX, un-
fortunately unpublished due
to space reasons, George As-
simakis referred to rumours
that "certain members of
council tried to boycott the
referendum by asking people-
not to vote"; he also claims
that certain year reps, refused
to announce the referendum
to their years and failed to
help in manning the ballot
boxes, resulting in some years
voting almost completely and
others hardly at all.
In all, however, the referen-
dum has shown that the
students here are not as apa-
thetic as some would like to
think, and that they want a
much more democratic and
representative structure in
ICU. Certainly, the most im-
portant result of the referen-
dum has been the overwhelm-
ing majority in favour of re-
form in the president and
secretary's election system.
Constitutional Final
referendum results
The 1742 people who took part in the referendum voted as follows:
Do you believe that Yes No Abst.
Constituent colleges should exist ? 1221 491 30
ICWA should exist ? 976 727 39
Exec, should exist ? 1243 434 65
ICU should join NUS ? 781 922 39
President should have Sabbatical year ? 968 708 66
President and Secretary should be elected
by a vote throughout the college ? 1322 396 24
Departmental reps, should be on council ? 1064 603 75
Seven Vice-Presidents for I.C.U.
Proposals submitted to
ICU Council by the consti-
tutional reform working party
are reformist rather than
revolutionary. Seven Vice-
Presidents are suggested, the
additions being Welfare, Ex-
ternal Affairs, Academic and
Internal Affairs (instead of
the present Deputy Presi-
dent). Three types of UGM
are recommended, including
one without a quorum but
with s t i p u l a t e d publicity
regulations.
The size of Council would
be considerably increased to
37 by including eleven de-
partmental reps. President,
Secretary and departmental
reps would be elected by
general ballot and most of
the other Union Officers from
the floor of the Union AGM.
The party have recom-
mended Council have more
major sub-committees—wel-
fare, external affairs, aca-
demic, house and finance
beside the clubs committees.
However they have not made
recommendations on NUS,
1CWA or the constituent col-
leges on the grounds that it
was not their business. The
Executive stays, slightly mod-
ernised but due to lack of
time no recommendation,
other than that of further
study, has been made on the
question of a Sabbatical year
for the President.

The inimitable Barrow Poets.
R.C.S. Carnival raves
to Chickenshack
Last Friday night and Sat-
urday morning, the RCS
Time Machine turned on
about 500 people, just as the
adverts claimed. Such was
the enthusiasm generated by
the audience that both of the
star attractions, Chicken-
shack and The Barrow Poets
overran their time by a con-
siderable amount at no extra
charge to the organisers.
Chairman of RCS Ents, John
"Butty" Butterworth, claimed
that more stayed through the
night for their early morning
soup than ever had done be-
fore. The loss on the event is
believed to be in the region
of £100, not an overlarge sum
for such superb entertain-
ment.
'At home'
The Tizard Hall " A t
Home "' was held last Tues-
day to enable residents to
meet their tutors in the more
social atmosphere of Tizard
gallery. Punch and wine were
served and plates of biscuits
and nuts were periodically
replenished and passed round
amdng the residents and their
guests'.
Unfortunately, few students
took advantage of the
occasion to bring their tutors
or other representatives of
their departments, and the
majority just came to drink
what they, would have to pay
for anyway. The punch was
disappointingly weak, but
this was compensated for by
the wine.
The evening lasted from 6
till eight and the drink lasted
remarkably well, so the
evening was enjoyed by all.
Publicity stunt
goes astray
In the early hours of Tues-
day morning a week ago two
geology I students could have
been sitting on the top of the
wall of Wandsworth Prison
for 1| hours. The idea was to
break in, put up Carnival
posters and break out again.
But surveying the patrolling
warders and loose police dogs
they decided to just sit on the
wall. One person rang up the
Mirror for publicity and the
sin-in was then terminated
by the arrival of the police.
Four people spent the night
in jail but were released mid-
day Tuesday after making
statements.
Corr's footnote
On seeing this week's
'They Tell Me', Dermott Corr
wished to comment "Who
told him that?"
