LETTER SENT T J ^ E L I X but far too l a t e for i n c l u s i o n i n
F e l i c i t y . This l e t t e r appears here n e i t h e r with the approval nor the
disapproval of FELIX.
Dear S i r ,
The woridng party on the Reform of the C o n s t i t u t i o n produced a
report to Councl, some of i t based on the referendum^ and some of i t >
containing more r a d i c a l a l t e r a t i o n s suggested by the working party ,
themselves.
These ideas should then have been discussed, w i t h the reasons f o r
and a g a i n s t , at Monday's Council meetingt Unfortunately, t h i s was made
more d i f f i c u l t by the absence of some members of the working p a r t y .
Thos"e members of the working party './ho stayed f o r the d i s c u s s i o n
(and who were a majority of the working party) are now prepared to accept
a d i s c u s s i o n at the Union meeting based qn, the Council v e r s i o n . We would
therefore l i k e ' t o point' out that the people r a i s i n g the o r i g i n a l report
are doing so p u r e l y as i n d i v i d u a l s , and not' as the c o n s t i t u t i o n a l
reform working p a r t y .
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,
