Nine goals in U.L.
cup thriller
IC 2nd XI 4, UC 3rd XI 5
This semi-final match was
eventually played on a rather
muddy pitch after three pre-
vious attempts had been
postponed. IC attacked
strongly in the opening min-
utes and were unlucky not
to go into the lead when J.
Nicol hit the post following
a good move. This one piece
of bad luck seemed to deter
the 2nd XI and UC were al-
lowed to come more into the
game and opened the scoring
with a speculative shot for
which the IC goalkeeper
was unsighted. UC's second
goal came shortly afterwards
when a defensive error al-
lowed the centre-forward to
score an easy goal.
The second half continued
in much the same way with
IC having as much of the
play as UC but not looking
like scoring. The break came
when Nicol won the ball in
a bounce-up and short first
time into the net. Five min-
utes later R. J. Horlock,
heavily disguised as a 2nd XI
player, broke through on the
right to equalise. IC were
now in a commanding posi-
tion and it was no surprise
when A. Richards headed a
third goal with the UC de-
fence completely out of posi-
tion. With only five minutes
left to play and IC still in
a commanding position they
looked set for a place in the
final for the second year
running. However, UC con-
tinued to attack and follow-
ing a half-cleared corner.the
wing half shot through a
crowd of players to equalise.
The score at full-time was
3-3 and it was decided to
play extra time, despite the
heavy conditions. After
about 10 minutes UC went
ahead when an IC defender
was caught in possession just
outside the box. IC contin-
ued to fight back and deser-
vedly equalised when Nicol
scored his second goal. In
the second half of extra time
the play was end-to-end and
with both sides tiring it was
obvious that the next goal
would be the winner. It went
to UC when one of their tall
defenders rose above the IC
defence to head a good goal.
Ladies
Swim
Win
On Friday, 21st February,
in the first match in the Uni-
versity of London Swimming
League at our own pool, the
ladies swimming team beat
QEC by 33 points to 23. In
spite of having one excel-
lent swimmer QEC found
the all-round strength of IC
too much for them.
The medley relay was the
most exciting race, QEC tak-
ing a 5 yard lead on the
first leg only to find them-
selves trailing by two yards
after a good breast-stroke
leg by Linda Allan-Rowlan-
son. This lead was main-
tained by Jacquie Boardman
to give IC a good win.
Team: T. Brown, J. May-
cock, L. Allan-Rowlanson,
L. Campion, J. Boardman,
E. Bowker.
Joyce M. Maycock.
Reading
Regatta
The regatta at Reading
mentioned in the last issue
of FELIX did not go as well
as hoped, the first crew be-
ing defeated by 2 lengths in
their second race. In the sec-
ond VIIIs event our crew
won through to the final
where they met Reading
University. Reading led by
\ length after the start and
increased this to f length
after two minutes. However,
the IC crew began to close
up and at the finish spurted
hard and were unlucky to
lose by 2ft.
Both the Cambridge and
Oxford university crews were
practising on the Tideway
the other weekend and
though Cambridge appear
neater in their bladework
Oxford seem to have much
power available.

ICWA trounced in
UL hockey final
UC 5 IC 1
This year's final of the
UL Ladies Hockey Cup was
a complete reversal of last
year's in which IC beat UC.
iCWA's main fault was
their lack of co-ordination
and teamwork which was
demonstrated disastrously in
the first ten minutes of the
match—the ball was in the
IC half practically all the
time and UC took advantage
of this to score two good
goals. IC's play improved
after this and the match
evened out. The score was
2-nil to UC at half time but
IC looked as if they could
make a comeback. Indeed
soon after the second half
IC scored but the goal that
really stopped IC followed
five minutes later when the
whole of the IC defence
watched the UC centre for-
ward slam the ball into the
net from a corner. UC were
then spurred on to mount a
concentrated attack to which
IC had no reply and they
proceeded to score two more
goals giving the final score
5-1.
The ISWA team had not
played for a month due to
the weather but their main
downfall was the total lack
of teamwork, and if they are
to become U L champions
again ICWA must learn that
the sheer determination that
has carried them through in
the past cannot replace good
teamwork as a match win-
ner.
Ten Pin Bowlers all at
600's and 700's
Since the last report in
FELIX the club has had
several matches with a fair
amount of success. In the
National Universities League
there have been only three
matches due to an unfor-
tunate cancellation which
the opposition claimed as a
walkover.
The most recent match
was against Bath University.
This produced by far the
most satisfying match of the
whole season—a fitting end
to the season in the league.
The 1st team for once hit
form together, which pro-
duced their highest game
and series of the session.
In particular Trevor Long-
man broke all the College
individual records when he
bowled a 237 game and 610
series (173, 237, 200) — a
fantastic achievement. He was
the first bowler in the Col-
lege ever to break the 600
barrier. The 1st team there-
fore won 4-0, but unfortun-
ately the 3rds lost 0-4.
Trevor Longman's record
was short-lived. Last Wed-
nesday Dave Foster bowled
an even more fantastic 720
series (219, 223, 278). The
best game included 9 con-
secutive strikes. This not
only beats anything else
done at IC, but also beats
the ABC Acton's house re-
cord of 709.
On 1st February the club
entered two teams in a 12-
hour marathon bowling com-
petition at Birmingham at-
tended by about 30 univer-
sity clubs from all parts of
the country. The object was
for each team to accumulate
as high a pin-fall as possible
over the twelve hours. The
competition was won by
Southampton University with
a pin-fall of over 18,000,
with our 1st team ending in
a pleasing 8th position with
a pinfall of over 16,000.
Fierce struggle for 1st X V
National Westminster Bank
A week ago yesterday, I.C.
rugby firsts were honoured
by being the first team to
play against the newly
formed National Westmins-
ter Bank first team. An un-
usually large crowd, includ-
ing the Rector and Secretary
of IC and Mines Hon. Porno-
grapher, braved the bitterly
cold conditions to cheer IC
on to what was nearly an
unexpected victory.
The game began at half-
pace, the Bank looking dis-
tinctly disjointed and IC
distinctly hungover, but soon
came to the boil. A scrum
infringement just outside the
IC 25 gave the bank a 3 pt.
lead with a very well taken
penalty. This lead was very
short lived as IC replied with
a remarkable try. Having
won a good loose ball out-
side their own 25, Dave Bell
handled at speed, the ball
reaching Roy Anderson via
Noddy Connolly. Roy, seeing
J. Smithies was not feeling
too strong, threw a long pass
out to Martin Tomlinson who
passed his opposite number
with great ease, kicked
ahead and with John Smith-
9 pts. IC Ist XV 5 pts.
ies following up fast to hack
the ball on, Martin Tomlin-
son crossed the line to score.
Dave Bell kicked a good
conversion. Just before half
time the Bank scored a
scrappy try.
Half time passed with
Johnny Walker all round
(spectators only), thanks to
a kind-hearted and now pen-
niless Bank Manager. The
excitement in the second half
was so great that most spec-
tators departed to the bar for
another drink.
The second half developed
into a fierce struggle — IC
having the better of the play
but, as has been so common
this season, not being able to
turn their advantage into a
score. A dropped goal com-
pleted the scoring for the
Bank.
In the U.L. 7-a-side com-
petition on Saturday the 2nd
VII were beaten 10-8 in the
first round by R.H.C. and
the first VII went down 9-8
to U.C. in the next round
having beaten Wye College
first VII, 13-0.
4th win for
Jezette
The now perennial pedal
car race was held last week-
end in Bristol. The race was
run this year (efficiently and
profitably) by five second
year engineers from Bristol,
who undertok the organiza-
tion after the rag committee
refused due to the loss in-
curred last year.
Two teams from RCS and
one from Guilds were
entered. All of the cars when
running performed quite
well—'Bo', the Guilds' car,
having a little initial trouble
with their drive chain.
'Jezette IF, now in its fourth
year, scored its four and pos-
sibly most massive win; it
was over two hours ahead of
its nearest rival at the end
of the race. 'Big Jez', the
second RCS car, was running
fairly consistently, though
slowly, throughout the race.
I would like to congratu-
late the people who pedalled
the winning Jezette, and the
members of Guilds' and Big
Jez's teams for their gallant
efforts, and to tank all those
who came down to Bristol
to run the pits. Nick Holmes.
