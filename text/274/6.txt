COMMENT
The abysmal failure of the Albert Hall Carnival concert,
together with the decrease, compared to last year, in the
amount of money taken in street collections, suggests that
there is something basically wrong with the way this year's
carnival has been run. The question to be asked, and sub-
sequently answered, is where the failings lie and what can
be done to correct them.
The reasons given by the Carnival co-ordinator for the
failure are three-fold: a lack of experience, time and people.
Taking the final point first, the suggestion that not enough
people expressed a willingness to work for carnival is surely
borne out by the fact that one person alone was responsible
for running the concert, and only three were available to run
the discotheque at which the Carnival Queen was elected.
The fact that insufficient numbers joined Carnival meant
that the committee did not have enough time to arrange
things as they would have wished, the result being the almost
complete failure of the whole of Carnival Week.
The remedy for both the shortage of time and people
would surely be to hold the elections for Carnival co-ordi-
nator and decide the charity at the end of the previous ses-
sion, instead of the beginning of the Autumn term. The elec-
tion of the Carnival coordinator and the filling of all major
posts on Carnival at this time would give those elected
a chance to work out plans for Carnival over the summer
vacation and the choice of charity at the same time would
mean that raffle tickets and the relevant posters could be
prepared ready for immediate use at the beginning of the
new session. Arriving back at the beginning of term with all
the ground work laid, the committee would them be in a
position of being able to concentrate completely on creating
interest in Carnival (a position the present committee were
never allowed to enjoy).
Under the present system, all those people who are willing
to work in any capacity in the Union take posts at the club
and Union A.G.M.'s held at the end of the academic year,
and thus by the time Carnival is appealing for committee
members they are firmly entrenched in the various clubs, and
perhaps more importantly for them in Hall. The remaining
failing to be overcome next year is that of the lack of experi-
ence which exists in this year's committee. There must be
more continuity between the Carnival committee of this year
and that of next. Since a number of this year's committee
have expressed a willingness to carry on in some capacity
next year, this is the ideal time to bring the elections forward
and ensure this continuity. As the success or failure of Carni-
val respectively adds to or detracts from the prestige of the
I.C.U., we must do all in our power to make next year's
Carnival less of a failure than this has been.

STAFF-STUDENTS
"STERILE TO IMPROVEMENT"
Sir,
As a member of a staff-
student committee, I should
like to reply to the letter of
Mr. D. Christopher concern-
ing student participation in
university policy. He be-
moans the fact that these
committees discuss matters in
a reasonable manner. Perhaps
he would like to explain what
can be achieved through
being unreasonable. The
question "what if both sides
reason differently?" is totally
irrelevant and symptomatic
of the attitude expressed by
P. Corbyn and others of "us
the students against them the
staff". This attitude is ex-
tremely naive and completely
sterile towards improvement;
it merely serves to undermine
the existing staff - student
relations.
The aim of staff-student
committees has been, since
their birth two years ago, to
establish an atmosphere in
which all parties concerned
can meet and discuss matters
relevant to their needs. Con-
siderable progress in this
respect has been achieved in
Ithe Physics department. A
number of recommendations
by the committee have been
implemented and several new
ideas brought up by the
students have been in direct
parallel to those brought up
by the staff. A staff working
party has been set up to re-
examine the whole purpose of
physics education and the
staff will, of their own
initiative, consult student
opinion.
This degree of co-operation
and understanding has not
been attained by taking over
the senior tutor's office and
singing "We shall overcome".
Neither has it been attained
by presenting the staff with
a series of ultimatums. It
goes without saying that
students will only be given
participation in university
policy when they show them-
selves sufficiently responsible
to bear the task.
A level of confidence must
exist between staff and stu-
dents before major changes
instigated at staff - student
committees can be brought
about. Instead of casting

DINNER
Sir,
We would like to dispel the
rumour (as reported in the
last FELIX) that people
applying for the RCS annual
dinner now would be unlikely
to be allocated tickets.
In fact, our policy will be
to allocate tickets on a "ran-
dom sample" basis, all appli-
cations received before 7th
March having a chance. So
if anyone is interested, we
would urge them to fill in a
form and send it in im-
mediately.

aspersions on staff-student
relations, Messrs. Corbyn,
Christopher and Co. would
be far better employed in
building up this level of con-
fidence.

staff-student committee)
THE REDS ARE COMING
Sir,
Recently, the matter of
vandalism at LSE has re-
ceived a good deal of atten-
tion in the columns of FELIX
from our socialist sob-
sisters at IC. Generally speak-
ing they have put forward
the view that their comrades
at LSE are really good guys
and gals being oppressed by
Fascist authorities and the
police. I suggest, sir, that this
is not the case.
The gates at LSE were put
up by Dr. Adams (quite
rightly in my opinion) to stop
further illegal occupations of
the school by Communist
traitors. Some of the LSE
students then saw fit to tear
them down and as LSE is not
their property anyway they
had no right to do this.
Like Mr. Duckett (or
"Spukes" as he is known) I
attended one of the U L U
meetings and saw there (with
no particular surprise) the
usual motley selection of Red
agitators, like the well-known
pro-Chinese Communist, Mr.
Manohada. Unfortunately I
had to leave when the atmos-
phere became almost toxic.
I sincerely hope that
students at IC realise that we
have rights of free-speech in
this country which are virtu-
ally unparalleled anywhere
in the world except perhaps
in the USA.
We must make sure that
these rights are not abused
by a minority of Reds trying
to impose their views upon
all and sundry by encourag-
ing Right - Wing patriotic
students to attend all student
meetings and fight Com-
munism on the debating floor.
Lastly, I agree with John
Wayne: "f . . . Communism".

Find out first-hand
what life is like as a
Patent Examiner
You would be surprised to learn how interesting
a career as a Patent Examiner can be. Accept this
invitation to visit us at the Patent Office and find out
all about it first-hand.
Basically the job of the Patent Examiner is to vet
applications for the patenting of new ideas in electrical,
mechanical, chemical and other fields.
When you join you are assigned to a senior
Examiner who will start you off on the less complicated
specifications, to give you the chance to grasp the
mechanics of the task. As your aptitude develops so
you will be given more and more demanding work
and with less and less supervision, until eventually you
work entirely on your own.
Make no mistake about it, to meet the challenge
which this kind of work involves, you need an enquiring
mind and the ability to develop your critical and
analytical faculties to the highest degree. And you have
to be prepared to argue your case with the applicant
or his professional advisers.
You will earn an excellent salary, starting at £1,146
and reaching £1,927 after 3-5 years. Virtually all
examiners reach senior grade, salary up to £3,975.
This grade can be reached in 9-10 years. Holidays are
significantly better than you could expect in industry.
Non-contributory pension.
Now you have an outline idea of the job.
If you would like to find out more, please write to
Mr. C. L. B. Smith, The Patent Office, 25 Southampton
Buildings, London, W.C.2. He will send you full
details, and you can then arrange a day to visit the
Patent Office.
$Z You must have or expect to obtain a First or Second Class
Honours degree in engineering, physics, chemistry, or mathematics,
or an equivalent qualification, such as Corporate membership of
the I.EE., the I.C.E., or I.Mech.E.
