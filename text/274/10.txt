Apology
In, our report of the
RCSU meeting in the last
issue of Felix'we regret that
we misrepresented Jeff War-
ren's speech and accept that
he does not believe that the
forty students who wrote to
Lord Penny tried to masquer-
ade as the whole college. We
would also like to apologise
to Les Ebdon for suggesting
that he was either shouted
down or did not know what
he was talking about.
O.S.A. Dance
On 14th March the Over-
seas Students Committee is
holding an International
Dinner and Dance. This will
include an Indian Curry
Dinner, a cabaret featuring
Chinese sword dances and
Greek bouzouki songs and a
Jazz Band. An exhibition of
folk art from various coun-
tries will form the decoration
and National costume or
evening dress is to be worn if
possible.

INTERNATIONAL HALL,
BRUNSWICK SQUARE, W.C.1.
Sleepy residents of 43 and
44 Evelyn Gardens — the
latest student house to be
occupied — had to make a
speedy evaculation when fire
broke out al 5 a.m. on the
morning of Monday, Jan.
24th. Among those who
raced to the street was Steve
f-faslett, who had just moved
in after his Southside room
was also fire damaged.
At Bernard Sunley House,
a small fire broke out in
house 44 under the floor-
boards of a iirst floor land-
ing serving 4 rooms, and this
house and parts of 43 were
soon filled with a dense acrid
smoke. After a 999 call, three
fire appliances arrived. Some
students, awakened by the
noise, started knocking up
the others, and they were
joined by firemen. In the
apparent absence of an alarm
system, most residents were
unaware of the danger until
10. to 15 minutes after the
fire was discovered.
Damage caused by the fire
was small, as it did not have
time to get a hold. A small
hole burnt through the floor
had to be rather enlarged by
firemen in extinguishing the
outbreak. The landing was
barricaded off and the resi-
dents housed elsewhere.
Traces of acrid smoke re-
mained for several days.
The fire was caused by an
electrical fault, though no
official announcement has
been made as to the exact
cause or whether it could
happen again. Some residents
have complained about fire
precautions in general in the
Student Houses. Electrical
faults could arise from the
overloading of ring mains by
the use of unauthorised elec-
tric fires in place of the
allegedly inefficient and ex-
pensive heaters installed. The
wallpaper behind some of the
storage heaters on the land-
ings is badly charred, and fire
escapes are inadequate (in-
cluding barred basement
windows). Most serious of all
is the apparent lack of alarms
or fire escape procedure.
At least there were bells to
ring in Southside when elec-
trical equipment in room 647
burst into flames on the pre-
vious Sunday dinnertime and
set the curtains alight.
Although the resident was
away, a friend had the key
and the door had been left
unlocked, so the fire was
speedily dealt with. Burning
bedding was thrown out of
the window by the fire-
fighters, who included Mr.
Seaford, and most of Fal-
mouth gallery level was soon
covered in feathers. With a
badly charred window-frame,
the room will be out of
action for about 4 weeks.
R . C . S . U . n o m i n a t i o n s
Hustings for the election of
next year's RCS President
were held on Tuesday, and
a full report is in Felicity. At
the time of going to press,
there were two firm candi-
dates for the presidency —
Chris Kent and John Butter-
worth. .The former, from
Maths 2, is at present
R.C.S.U. Rep on Council
and also helps on many other
committees, while "Butty"
chairs the RCS ents commit-
tee, responsible for the RCS
Carnival Smoking Concert,
etc.
Two candidates have
emerged for the Vice-Presi-
dent. The better known is
Steve Morrisby, who has suc-
cessfully defended Theta for
the past few months. The
other is Barry Pywell, an
emanation from Physics 2,
who may be seen playing
scrabble outside the lifts on
level 3 on a fine day.
Penny Walters, who has
done much valuable work as
Assistant Secretary, is un-
opposed for the post of Secre-
tary. Although nominations
had closed by Felix press
date, the exact number of
candidates is uncertain, as
several sets of nomination
papers were stolen from
notice-boards.
The R.C.S.U. elections will
be held on Monday the 10th
of March.
Dramsoc again
The Dramatic Society's
production for this term will
be "The Two Gentlemen of
Verona". This little known
play by William Shakespeare
is the first of his works to be
performed by the Society for
more than a decade. For
some years, the Dramatic
Society has attempted to pro-
duce one popular and one
modern play a year, to cater
for a wide cross-section of
interests. Last term's play
was of the modern school,
this term's should appeal to
lovers of traditional drama.
"Shakespeare" is o f t e n
thought to be for culture vul-
tures only, but we believe
that this image has developed
from abysmally bad school
plays and "O" level English
Literature; well performed,
his plays provide a range of
dramatic spectacle ranging
from the thrilling to the
frothy. If past standards are
maintained, this production
can only be good and an
enjoyable evening is guaran-
teed for one and all.
JOE COCKER A N D
THE BONZO D O G
The second concert in aid
of the ailing carnival charity
funds was not the disaster the
first had been. All the ex-
pected groups turned up but
the hoped for audience was
scattered thinly around the
circumference of the vast
Albert Hall dome,
John Peel did his best to
hold the show together when
faced with long intervals
whilst Spooky Tooth and the
Bonzo Dog set up all their
TEACHING
AND
LEARNING
The Teaching and Learn-
ing Methods Conference will
take place on Friday 21st and
Saturday 22nd March. Six
speakers have been obtained
and a provisional programme
arranged. The Conference
will be opened by the Pro-
Rector Lord Jackson and
speakers include Dr. Ruth
Beard, head of the London
University Research unit into
Higher Education and Dr.
Topping, Vice-Chancellor of
Brunei University. Complete
programme details will be
posted around the Union in
the next week. About 40-50
students can attend with at
least one from each depart-
ment (Postgraduates are
welcome).
Anyone interested in at-
tending should drop a note
in the Union Office addressed
to Rex Lowin or Dave Wield.
equipment, but while both
these put on excellent per-
formances, the night surely
belonged to Joe Cocker and
the Grease Band, who started
rather badly but had changed
the whole atmosphere of the
concert by the end of their
act.
They did this with a mix-
ture of pure energy and a
selection of well chosen con-
trasting songs, which gradu-
ally succeeded in bringing the
audience over to their side.
Fortunately, the Smile, who
opened the show after the
interval were original enough
in their choice of style and
material to be entertaining
after Joe's act, but the Bonzo
Dog were partly spoilt by dis-
torted amplification making
a lot of their comedy un-
intelligible to the majority
near the back of the hall.
Nevertheless the only other
complaint that could be made
against the act was the short-
age of actual songs and the
proliferation of explosions,
and they must surely be
unique amongst other so-
called pop groups.
The show overran for half
an hour, and the Bonzo Dog
Band decided to donate £60
to cover this, for which we
must be grateful, and it is
only sad that more people
could not turn out to go
along and see the concert.
Although not the financial
catastrophe of the Spencer
Davis concert magnitude, a
loss of between £100 and £500
was made on this concert.
