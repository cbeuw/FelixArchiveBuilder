^tatty and ramshackle,

Enter . . . voices, music,

LCONSTANT FLUX.
Lots of things happen at
fthe Arts Lab. The name im-
plies experimentation, which
^is roughly speaking what it
E
' is about. Jim Haynes, the
main originator of the Arts
•Lab, is very concerned with
'" breaking down forms."
^One of his colleagues Frank
^Muller says similarly that
'^they want people to just go
; there, join in, and do their
;thing.
The big attraction for the
• next two months is Jane
^Arden's VAGINA R E X
t A N D T H E GAS OVEN,
:with Sheila Allen and Victor
Spinetti. This is a theatrical
production—well worth 10/-
— which is something to do
with women. It deals with
the way in which society im-
poses behavioural patterns
on both men and women.
The performance is mind-
shaking; the actors, acting
music, incredible lighting
effects, and screenplay arc
really great. Don't read a
review — go and see it!
Films, on show nightly,
are experimental / under-
ground / unusual. Both
theatre and films are often
on simultaneously with a
third area like: music,
poetry, dancing, mime, dis-
cussions, etc. Semi-perma-
nent features may be: exhi-
bitions of paintings or
photos, giant gonk shows,
light shows or whatever hap-
pens to be around, including
food.
The Arts Lab is the gate-
way to all sorts of Under-
ground Happenings. The
magazine stall has a good
range of world-wide hippy
magazines. International
Times and the notices on the
wall will tell you what's hap-
pening in London. The or-
ganisation is anarchitic and
confused •
— unlike the or-
derly lives of most people.
What happens if the Arts
Lab is too WAY OUT for
any government subsidy
(unlike the ICA which gets
massive government aid) so»
the Arts Lab grooves along{
by itself.
The atmosphere is very 5
friendly and enjoyable. Con-
versation often centres
around phoniness of curious
stories and reveals many dif-
fences in attitudes between
those who " frequent the
Underground" and those
who do not.
"The Lab" is open every
evening and night except
Mondays. There, you can
get a "calendar of what is
on", but better still read IT
(or Time Out, for some
items); for up-to-date infor-
mation dial 242-3047/8.

YOU (as a member of
USK) can join the Arts Lab
for 15/- instead of £1 (ob-
tain forms from Union Of-
fice and return them to
there). Membership entitles
entry to the building with as
many guests as you want, at
2/6 a time, and also access
to the Electric Cinema club
(find out about that from
Arts Lab or IT).
Piers Corbyn.
One of the strangest ano-
molies in the present student
grant system is the lack of a
London allowance for post-
graduates. At present even
the recently cut undergradu-
ate grant has a London
weighting of £35. How did
this situation come about?
Until 1962 there was a Lon-
don weighting on P.G.
grants. In that year the Ash-
by report was published.
This surveyed the expendi-
ture of 170 P.G.s from all
over Britain, 18 being from
London. 7 of the latter were
discounted on the grounds
that they spent too much
money, and on the basis of
the remaining 11 it was de-
cided that P.G.s did not need
a London allowance! The
report as a whole was not
accepted but this recom-
mendation was, not surpris-
ingly, adopted by the Gov-
ernment.
Reports
The case for a London al-
lowance is overwhelming. It
is manifestly obvious that it
is far more expensive to live
in London than in the pro-
vinces, and the principle of a
London allowance is accep-
ted by the Government for
the Civil Service. The report
of the Advisory Panel on
Student Maintenance Grants
recommended a London dif-
ferential of £40 for under-
graduates. For a postgradu-
ate attending for 44 weeks
this would indicate a weight-
ing of £60. Report Number
44 of the National Board for
Prices and Incomes, "Lon-
don Weighting in the Non-
Industrial Civil Service,"
stated that " it is the cost of
living which should be the
determining factor in the
question of London Weight-
ing." A survey by
A.S.T.M.S. of 60 S.R.C. fin-
anced P.G.s at I.C. was com-
pared with the figures for
civil servants considered by
the P.I.B. It was found that
the cost of accommodation,
travel, etc. of the P.G.s was
£272.5 p.a. compared with
£261.2 p.a. for civil servants
in the salary range £751 -
£1000. The P.I.B. recom-
mended a London weight-
ing of £120 for people in
this group.
Campaigns
Thus it can be seen that
the case for a London al-
lowance is very strong.
What, then, is to be done?
Already, A.S.T.M.S. is cam-
paigning on our behalf. Lon-
don weighting for P.G.s is
now official N.U.S. policy.
As yet, however, these do
not seem to have involved
the London postgraduates
themselves. On 20th Febru-
ary, I attended a meeting of
P.G. representatives called
by King's College Postgrad-
uate Society. The aim of this
meeting was to try and or-
ganise a campaign by Lon-
don P.G.s for a London al-
lowance. Strike action by
P.G.s who do tutorial work
etc, is among the possible
activities being considered.
Letters are being sent both
to Edward Short and to the
press. Clearly it will be
necessary to co-ordinate such
a campaign with A.S.T.M.S.
and N.U.S. But the P.G.s of
London should be in the
forefront of their own fight.

Cadbury's
a move ahead
Things have changed. Once Cadbury's just meant chocolate. Now there's so much
more to this growing company. Much more opportunity as the Cadbury name
appears on cakes, on Marvel milk, on Smash instant potato. More still: Cadbury's
are now united with other big names in the sweetshop —Fry, Pascall, Murray —
in a growing world of opportunity.
Opportunities that is worldwide — seven overseas companies supplying our
products everywhere.
Opportunity that you can only find in a company with a turnover of more than
£130M
Opportunity for you. Each year we recruit from the universities for many fields:
engineering; research development; production; sales & marketing; personnel;
management services; advertising and costing.
SCIENCE and ENGINEERING graduates will find that advanced thinking and the
constant search for new products, techniques and processes create a wide range
of challenging and interesting problems. The training programme and experience
arranged for engineers, for example, enables them to apply for membership of
the Professional Institution.
Management is the key-word and only graduates capable of doing a senior
management job in technical departments after a few years will be recruited.
For some there will be opportunities of more general management or production.
Suitable trainees may be given experience with one of the overseas companies.
We believe that a graduate should be given responsibility for a real job as soon
as possible and therefore we recruit initially for specific vacancies. Training is
thorough and, for the best, progress is fast.
For more information about the Company or the specific vacancies available, write
