Imperial College Union has frequently suffered i n the past from
inquoracy. This h.s often prevented e s s e n t i a l business from being
c a r r i e d out. To overcome t h i s problem we recommend two major chances.
One i s the lowering of the quorum, except for c o n s t i t u t i o n a l changes,
at ordinary general meetings. The second i s the i n t r o d u c t i o n of the
no quorum general meeting. The flow of information and ideas between
the Union o f f i c e r s and the Union f l o o r at present could be considerably
improved. This can be done by the holding of termly meetings at which
o f f i c e r s must present r e p o r t s . These meetings w i l l be sc arranged that
those i n t e r e s t e d w i l l always be able to hear and discuss these important
matters. The s i x weeks warning of dates and two weeks n o t i c e of all-
matters to be discussed w i l l ensure that a l l union members are f u l l y
informed of what i s coming up. Better communic t i o n s are ensured by
the s p e c i f i c a t i o n of p u b l i c i t y and n o t i f i c a t i o n of meetings.
We add two major sub.-committees, of C o u n c i l . The House Committee
already e x i s t s , chaired by the Deputy President (renamed the Internal
A f f a i r s V i c e - P r e s i d e n t ) , and i s merely the equivalent of an Internal
A f f a i r s Committee. The work i t does i s a load o f f Executive members,
The Finance Committee i s new and w i l l enable a small group to look i n
some d e t a i l at annual .estimates and extraordinary grant requests. I t
w i l l also enable I . C . U , to be able to discuss the general trend of
spending. This information w i l l g r e a t l y help Council to be more-
e f f e c t i v e stewards of our money.
Apart from these major changes, there are a number of minor changes
to bring the By-Laws up to date, wnich we are not amplifying i n t h i s
preamble and we f e e l speak for themselves.
Concerning s a b b a t i c a l years, .we do not t h i n k that we have considers
t h i s nearly f u l l y enough to make any recommendation. We suggest Councii
sets up a fresh Working Party to discuss t h i s very complex i s s u e ,
