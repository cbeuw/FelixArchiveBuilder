& TAKEOVER
This year Liverpool, the O.A.U. cross country
champions, w i l l compete, together with t i e i r runners-up fp'
Manchester and Reading and also Loughborough (the
present holders of the Relay troohy, the Roderic
H i l l Cup). But none of these can hone to challenge X
U.C.L., who provided 4 of the 6 London men who f i n i s h e d
i n the f i r s * 9 out of ,a f i e l d of 140. On the strength
of t h i s astonishing performance they are almost certain to
shatter Loughborough's 1955 record of 82 min. 28 sec. ( s i x
men i n each team), I.C., with Evans and Pain, might have
been able to challenge them, but are now without Locke and
Conway.
John Evans (I.C.) i s the favourite amonej the i n d i y -
i d u a l s . Last year he was 1 second slower than J . Knopf
-"CTX (Selwyn, Camb.), who set the record of 12 min. 55 sec. The

Empire # mile champion, and I. Boyd (Brasenose),
who ran with Bannister at Vancouver, while Carab-

steeplechaser. A Brown (Nottingham) and J .

in U.A.U., w i l l also be present.
The race s t a r t s at 2.45 p.m. tomorrow, and
the support of I.C. helpers and cheerers i s urg-
ently requested. If the weather is f i n e , both
records should topple and many f i r s t rate perf-
ormances/can be exoected.

Once again t h i s season has John Evans been
v i c t o r i o u s i n the b a t t l e of the giants. The occas-
ion t h i s time was the London Colleges Trophy Race,
held at Walthamstow under the auspices of SJV.E.T.C.
The going was treacherous, and a Slow time
was anticipated. However, one had to move fast t o \
keep warm, despite the mud and i c e , and most
people turned i n excellent times. Evans beat-
Richards (U.C.) by 30 yards to win the race i n a
new record time
to f i n i s h 3rd

I.C. LOSE IN EXTRA-TIME
The serai-final of the jU.,L', cup was played on
Wednesday, Feb. 15th.,, against i,.S.R. at Shenley,
the U.C. ground. The grouh$ was frozen underneath
but had thawed out on the surfjace, which uaide the
players look l i k e budding b a l l e r i n a s with, tackety
boots.
Play was very even to s t a r t with, but was more
robust than clever, owing to the conditions under-
foot. L.S.E. scored f i r s t with a well-taken goal
from a corner. Better marking by the I.C. defence
would have prevented this'goal'.
Being a goal down spurre/d I.C. to greater
e f f o r t s , as usual, and gradually became just "on
top" of L.S.E.. For the remainder of the f i r s t
h a l f I.C. looked dangerous and goals were well
taken by Holgate and May, MANY MORE .VERE MISSED.
The second half commenced with I.C. i n con-
t r o l with a 2-1 lead. However, L.S.E. took advan-
tage of a not uncommon habit of I.C. - s i t t i n g
back when i n the lead. The L.S.E. half-backs took
more control of the game and soon scored a f t e r
outskating the I.C. defence i n one of the many
pas de deux,scenes. From then on the game was very
even again, play swinging from end to end and neither
side looking l i k e scoring. Cup-tie tension b u i l t u i f
the game proceeded and several players tended
to kick b l i n d l y rather than thinkingly play the
b a l l . In t h i s s i t u a t i o n I.C. would have benefited
by a seasoned player l i k e Jim Anderson in the side.
J i n had a set of tartan kittens on the touch line!
Twenty minutes of extra time were olayed much
in the, same vein and T..S..E. scored a well taken
goal a few minutes before the end.
Play throughout was t y p i c a l cup t i e robustness
and never reached a spectacular l e v e l . The, I.C.
team was very disappointing as i t did not play uo
to standard. Unfortunately, Les Locke who had
played i n an international t r i a l i n Scotland the
previous e«ening did not strike^ torn and was a
"marked man" by L.S.E.
Hope springs eternal and perhaps next year
I.C. w i l l surmount the semi-final hoodoo- i f only
they w i l l put more "guts" into t h e i r f o o t b a l l .
Congratulations to Les Locke who has been capped
for Scotland against Ireland.
