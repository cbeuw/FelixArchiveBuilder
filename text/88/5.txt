According to your BditoriaJ in the last number of Felix,
you seem to share the view held by a numbeir of other people,
that I.C. should keep out of H.F.3. at a l l costs because of
the "politics" of the latter body.
I f a i l to find in your artiola any details whatever of
the alleged political affiliations of the N.U.S., although,
by saying that "The Union Officers have always felt i t their
duty .... to avoid connection with anything bearing a politi-
es! tag" you oertainly imply that the N.U,S. has a definite
political colour, although the possibility of this colour
changing abruptly is not ruled out either.
To support this view, you give precisely two instances
of "political activity by the N.U.S. The first is that, at
the outbreak of the last war, i t advised all students: to
avoid! Military Servioe by becoming Pacifists. Pacifists
are not members of any particular political party, as you
probably know. The second instance you quote is that the N.U.S.
defied the Cold War by "sending i t s officers to Mosoow".
Apparently, by this you mean that i t sent a delegation to
Moscow. I think I am right in sayin," that several bodies,
including nearly a l l the politioal parties of this country,
from the Conservatives to the Communists, have also sent
delegations to Mosoow. Whatever can have prompted I.C. to
leave N.U.S. because of this attempt at promoting internat-
ional understanding I oannot "imagine.
lorn mention the advantages of being a member of N.U.S.
although, because of your fear of the "politioal" bogy, I
feel that you belittle these .advantages. The excuse that
other travel bureaux also offer cheap tours and travel is a
pitiful one. N.II.S. offers the chanoe to meet STUDENTS
from other parts of the worla. Xou consider that the Vac-
ation Work Scheme is unnecessary because most of us do tech-
nical work in the summer vacation,anyhow. I would point
3ut that jobs in the Christmas and Easter vacs, are also ad-
vertised and these are by no means insignifioant. The
only other criticism you can make is that i t "appears to be
bureaucratic". I think this shoves how hard-Tjressed you
are to find fault with the scheme.
The most important reason.why I.C. should join N.U.S.
is that i t is the only recognised representative body of
students in the United Kingdom. In my view, this overrides
a l l other considerations, as i t means that this College can
make i t s voice heard, through official channels, in any mat-
ter affooting students as a whole. Take the question of
grants as one example. Our I.C. Union President could only
attend a reoent N.U.S. conference on that subject as an obs-
erver, and although he expressed the opinion that the Confer-
ence fulfilled no useful purpose whatever, I feel that "sour
grapes" entered into that viewpoint.
If the R.S.M. Union wishes to remain outside N.U.S. i f
I.C. joins i t , let them. After a l l , their job includes
putting themselves ( and their heads ) into the ground.
lours faithfully,
Prank Thilo
I.C. Union.
Dear S i r ,
Our personal experience of N.U.S, has led us
to reply to c e r t a i n points i n your e d i t o r i a l of F e l i x
No. 87. We would l i k e to draw attention to the
f a c t that the N.U.S. c o n s t i t u t i o n forbids discussion
of p o l i t i c a l or r e l i g i o u s questions not connected
with student a f f a i r s .
In our own personal experience we several times
disagreed with c e r t a i n aspects of N.U.S. policy, but
we were s a t i s f i e d that by d i s a f f i l i a t i o n we would
do nothing to improve the p o l i c y of the National Union
By r e a f f i l i a t i n g I.C. Union could exert our consid-
erable influence to ensure that through N.U.S.
the r e a l views of the students of t h i s country are
made known. It i s f o r t h i s reason that we consider
the p o l i c y of N.U.S. at a p a r t i c u l a r time to be
no v a l i d reason f o r n o n - a f f i l i a t i o n . The true issue
is that a strong national union i s e s s e n t i a l and the
absence of Imperial College i s hampering i t s .
effectiveness.

Dear S i r ,
Hawing the doubtful p r i v i l e g e of three years'
experience of a product of I.C., I am sadly led
to believe that the majority of students there are
sexually starved or neurotic. Please are there any
normal men w i t h i n those learned walls? I am about
to enter the teaching profession and I should l i k e
the assurance that a l l my l i t t l e boys interested
i n science w i l l not be doomed to the same f a t e .
As the Teaching Profession i s so short of Seeenee
Teachers I am w i l l i n g to show any interested student
around my establishment of learning, where we are
made so enthusiastic about our future jobs.
Perhaps t h i s may woo some more fools into
a good c a u s e — t h e education of future s c i e n t i s t s .
Sincerely,
S c i e n t i s t admirer
E i l e e n T a f f a .
ip.S. Kieaae p r i n t t h i s and you sstjr see that some
etfasxre agree with me .
