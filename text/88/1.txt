No. 8 8 IMPERIAL COLLEGE 24th Feb. 1956
OWL'S VISIT
C.E.M. MASCOT HELD
Tt was on Thursday, 9th. February at
lunchtime that two students, one from R.C.Sj,
the other from Guilds, entered the l i b r a r y
of the College of Estate Management. The
other two occupants looked up and l e f t the
room, leaving t h e i r cement owl undefended
on the mantel piece. It was promptly
c a r r i e d out under a coat, long before the
o f f i c i a l party of twenty I.C. men could
a r r i v e , complete with wedges to jam the
swing doors and spare trousers f o r any
casualties sustained.
The, two students who took the owl
were members of the Dramatic Society
who have taken a great interest i n
other London Colleges t h i s session.
They decorated the owl i n appropiate
colours and crest t o display at the
nocturnal f r i v o l i t i e s the following
night when the Royal School of Mines
were holding t h e i r Carnival "Dreamland"
Americans Debate with Imperial
If "Love should always come before duty"
i s a good debating motion, i t almost c e r t a i n l y i s
even better when discussed on St. Valentine's
day, and I.C. were even l u c k i e r i n that they
had a chance t o see and hear the two-man American
U n i v e r s i t i e s debating team, at present touring
U n i v e r s i t i e s and Colleges in t h i s country.
The American pair, Joseph Trattner and P h i l i p
McCellan, opposed each other, Trattner beginning
his speech by doing an impression of a " t e r r i b i y >
t e r r i b l y , English voice, don't you know'' and
proceeded t o present t o the Chairman (Les Alien)
'as representative of the house' with an American
f l a g , a bright red tartan g o l f cap (cheers as
•the Chairman put i t on), a p a i r of multicoloured
socks, ('ideal, f o r evening Wear') and l a s t but by
no means least a f u l l - l e n g t h picture of La Monroe.
The cheers f o r t h i s turned t o c r i e s of, disappointment
chagrin or possibly f r u s t r a t i o n as Mr^ Trattoer
r o l l e d up the picture again and put i t back into
his nag.
He and h i s opposite number? then s e t t l e d
down t o t a l k and show just why they were picked
from the many American1
U n i v e r s i t i e s , both pleading
t h e i r cause sincerely and at the same time
l i b e r a l l y backing t h e i r speeches with anecdotes.
The second proposer, Raphael Berenbaum, showed
as always that he was no mean speaker, and he too
was successful with such remarks as "The other day
I drove into an American c a r — h a d t o drive out
again though, there wasn't enough room t o park."
He achieved the neat balance of putting a case and
at the same time being pleasantly amusing. Michael
Be'rnstein seconded the opposition, proving on h i s
way that even speakers of Sanskrit understood a
Certain motto with reference t o a dinghy, a ladder
and a gent named Jacob.
There was only time f o r four short speeches
from the f l o o r . John Bingham's was the best, but
Mr. Webb and one other who pleaded f o r abstention
had t h e i r reward when the vote came, the motion being
c a r r i e d by 110 votes t o 33 with no less than 35
abstentions. It was an entertaining debate even i f
i t was not a p a r t i c u l a r l y stimulating one.
TO CARNIVAL
RAGGING ENSUES
Press p u b l i c i t y reached the College
of Estate Management t e l l i n g them that"

The Royal School of Mines was the
f i r s t target of those hoping t o regain
the owl, but the cooperation of the
President, Secretary and Clerk of the
Union provided an adequate information'
service as t o the marauders' where-
abouts. Chief of Staff Kitchener, \
telephone in, each hand, sat i n the
Union o f f i c e d i r e c t i n g operations.
Groups of students accumulated inside
the entrance h a l l s of various parts of
the College and routed the estate men.
One Guildsman who pursued them too
far went f o r a ride i n one of t h e i r
cars.He was redeemed f o r two of' t h e i r
own men and two p a i r s of t r o u s e r s , t h i s
r e f l e c t i n g the current market value of
technicians.
The owl has since been displayed
in various parts of the College. _____
