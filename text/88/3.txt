In the l a s t f o r t n i g h t , Imperial College
has entertained v i s i t i n g Americans. The front
page reports a debate, the f i r s t one i n London
in which the touring American debaters took i
part. An account of the Touchstone weekend its
given elsewhere at which the U.S. C u l t u r a l •
Attache was guest speaker. i
The American people have a sense of humour.
They r e a l i s e t h e i r position i n the world today
and expect to be taunted a l i t t l e , e s p e c i a l l y by
Europeans, about t h e i r way o f life.They even
make jokes about themselves, l o c a l i s i n g the
region of boasters t o Texas. This i s hardly a
reason f o r b a i t i n g our guests continuously, and
t h i s d i d occur i n a few instances recently.
If proper h o s p i t a l i t y had been extended t o '
the v i s i t e r s by the Union, instead of leaving i t
to those with an axe to grind, our guests might
not have l e f t Imperial College with the
impression that i t was a hot bed of communist
a g i t a t o r s .

Since, because of
their rowdy behaviour generally, men are not f i t to
Oe i n residence, the Hostel should be entirely inhab-
ited by women. Strange men would then be welcome i n
strange places.
Continuing i n this
vein, we might well ask
why some of the males
of this I n s t i t u t i o n of
Learning manage to be

are l i t t l e better than

Members of the botany department who, due to
Mr. Mooney's failure to provide pancakes on Shrove Tues-
day, cooked their own, have suggested a pancake-tossing
competition in the bar next year. Let us hope the new
bar i s ready by then as there i s hardly room to eat a
pancake i n the present bar. Nevertheless the usual
elbow-bending would appear to be drying up the supply
faster than ever: on Saturday night' the bar ran out of
brown and Worthington and at the extension upstairs
there was so l i t t l e choice around ten o'dock that I had
to (try to) drink ginger beer. It was also unfortunate
that the Carnival bar was very nearly dry at one o'clock
and i t was impossible, to get a drink without f i r s t find-
ing a glass. As there were very few glasses in the hall
i t was obvious where most of them were and i t was easy to
deduce where the drink had got to from the fact that a
far smaller proportion of people than usual lasted the
night out in good form. Last year i t was left to R.C.S.
to show that a Carnival does not need to be a riot; l e t
us hope that this year they can show that you do not have
to be drunk to appreciate i t .
This year has seen the appearance of noticeable num-
bers of attractive secretaries on the college scene. I t
is generally accepted that Guilds leads in quantity «+
,
least. Any offers for running a survey - or a competition?
The mountaineering community was very much in evidence
at the Carnival following a dinner which many of them had
attended. Ascents were made on the front of the Union
and on the Albert Hall. Some men from C.E.M. thought :
.
that the former climb was to hide some kind of owl. While
tackling the Albert Hall they observed a young lady run-
ning away from the Carnival pursued by an agitated-looking
fellow with a red beard.
Congratulations to the men who painted Reggie a fortnight ago.
Any form of attack on this, perhaps the most famous of college
mascots, is always news, even in "Sennet". Reggie was ac-
quired by a group of King's women some years ago when they
sawed i t off a pub in Chiswick, Perhaps Herbert could ach-
ieve such fame,, Ifw e
could persuade the rest of the Univers-
ity that he came out of an egg laid by a member of I.C.?.A.
Incidentally Herbert, who disappeared mysteriously last Maroh,
is expected to re-appear shortly.
A contingent of R.C.S. men made up a highly successful
theatre party to Chelsea Palace last Friday night to cheer
on Phyllis Dixie, who is s t i l l performing the same old antics.
All were sufficiently well oiled to approve highly of the show,'
but the' management, for some reason or other, appeared somewhat
i l l at ease. .Afterwards, as a reward for livening up a certain
Chelsea coffee bar normally noted for being rather dull, seven
cops, the Maria and a rather disinterested looking Alsatian
honoured the company with their presence.
From the "News of the World"report an the court case
following the recent rag at Liverpool:
"Assaults occurred wheh students resisted arrest or
when others,acting through misguided loyalty,went to the
aid of those being arrested."
I.C. GOES MIDDLE EASTERN
The Israeli .evening organised by the International
Relations Cltib and the Jewish Society begun etth a tourist
film on Israel-They Met i s Galilee. This film was good with
its vivid contrasts of old and new. Then came an interesting
talk by Mr L.Savir, the Israel Embassy's Prase Attache.
Everyone had been waiting for the free produce, and at
the interval there was a rush to the tables with requests-
peanuts- more oranges- lets try that sherry- what about an-
other glass. The liberal supply of nuts, fruit and wine was
all gone in ten minutes.
A group of young dancers pounded the floor of O^iaenies
accompanied by two hundred pairs of stamping feet, most of
whose owners were loudly singing to the music, and after-
wards the display of Israeli handicrafts was carefully
examined.
This was one of the beet attended social meetings so
far this session.
m.CS. MOTOR CLUB.
About JO men turned up at a meeting i n the R.CS. last
Friday to disouss the formation of a Motor Club. Derek Toms,
in the chair , emphasised that the fire-engine was in need
of cere end neintenenoe and i t sounded as tbcufh. another big-
end was e
m the way out. Furthermore, the three at jreeent
qualified to drive i t would Be leaving at the end of the
year, so i t wos necessary for more go learn.
It was decided to form a Motor CU_ with the primary
purpose of looking after the fire-engine, but which would
also organise rallies, visits and other stwHsr create. A
oommittea was set up *a enquire into ways and means, end the
club will Be put on e regular footing.
