STATEMENT OF COLLEGE POLICY
A . The present p o s i t i o n
It has long been C o l l e g e policy to protect the safety of its
members, v i s i t o r s , neighbours and the public generally within
or near its premises to the fullest extent that is practicable.
Measures in use to achieve this include:-
a) the proper provision and maintenance of buildings,
laboratories, plant, services and equipment;
b) the provision and maintenance of safe means of
escape and of a c c e s s by emergency services, and
the practice of emergency d r i l l s ;
c) the provision and maintenance of alarm systems
and fire fighting equipment;
d) the provision of information, instruction, training
and supervision in safety procedures;
e) the provision of safety rules, the enforcement of
stringent conditions in respect of hazardous work,
and the supply of protective equipment.
The good sense and technical competence of individual mem-
bers of staff contribute significantly to the prevention of a c c i d -
ents and injury. The College, corporately, seeks to promote aware-
ness of the importance of safety. The organisation which e x i s t s
to deal with matters of safety, health and welfare at work oper-
ates through five College committees, which are advisory to the
Rector.
The College Safety Committee c o n s i s t s of various s p e c i a l i s t s
drawn from the academic and technical staff, and has student re-
presentation. It reviews C o l l e g e procedures, issues Codes of
P r a c t i c e , investigates a c c i d e n t s , advises on the lessons to be
learnt from them, briefs Departmental Safety Officers, arranges
-lectures and gives publicity to information on safety . The C o l l e g e
Chief Maintenance Officer, F i r e Officer and Laser Officer are
members of this Committee. A F i e l d Station Safety Committee per-
forms a s i m i l a r function on a s c a l e commensurate with the a c t i v i -
ties at the F i e l d S t a t i o n .
'• A l l work involving hazards of ionizing radiation is controlled
by the Radiation Safety Committee and the College Health Phy-
s i c i s t in accordance with the C o l l e g e Code of Practice and in
compliance with statutory requirements. Safety at the Nuclear
Reactor is supervised by the Reactor Safety Committee.
Arrangements for medical attention within the College are
supervised by the Medical Services Committee. Three part-time
Medical Officers and three full-time nurses staff the Health
Centre w h i c h provides medical and s i c k bay services for stud-
ents. Opthalmic and psychiatric treatments are a l s o arranged.
The Centre provides cover for the treatment of accidents during
working hours and gives medical advice to a l l staff who seek it,
but is not allowed to prescribe treatment except in emergencies.
Innoculations are provided free for a l l staff. The Centre is a l s o
concerned with a d v i s i n g and monitoring on occupational health
problems.
The Student C o u n s e l l o r provides professional advice on w e l -
fare and on personal problems. Student Welfare is the particular
concern of certain members of the academic staff who are
appointed as tutors .
Within this general framework the day-to-day Implementation
of safety requirements is in the hands of the departments, oper-
ating through a Departmental Safety Committee and/or one or
more Departmental Safety Officers. They are responsible for sup-
ervision of Safety precautions, provision of safety equipment and
F i r s t A i d Equipment appropriate to the needs of each department
and for Information and publicity .
B . New Developments in Safety P o l i c y
College provisions in the field of Safety and Health have evol-
ved continuously to meet changing requirements and situations .
The Health and Safety at Work e t c . A c t (1974) provides an import-
ant new national stimulus in this area, which c a l l s for a positive
response.

ON SAFETY
The obligations and r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s which are laid down in
the A c t apply to everyone working at the C o l l e g e ; and existing
procedures w i l l be revised, where necessary, to meet them. The
review now being undertaken w i l l cover general safety policy,
the arrangements for expert a d v i c e and supervision, and the met-
hods of practical implementation at departmental l e v e l . It is
expected to lead to a strengthening and extension of current
provisions for safety; to the establishment of more formal m a c h -
inery for consultation with a l l sections of the College community;
and to the adoption of a Code of Safety as a development of the
existing College Safety manuals.
With the co-operation of a l l groups of College members fur-
ther progress w i l l be made towards the common aim of combining
efficient working with the fullest possible protection of safety
and health.
