THIS A R T I C L E is written on behalf
of a number of final year Mechanical E n g -
ineering students at Imperial C o l l e g e . A s
the year has progressed it has become
obvious that there i s a body of opinion
amongst us that was not wholly satisfied
with what we saw a s our intended role in
industry. T a l k i n g about problems is a l -
ways useful, but there comes a time when
the only way to maintain one's conviction
is to do something, and this i s an explan-
ation of what is wrong and what we are
trying to do.
We feel that the problem is best sum-
marised by saying that, in general, there
is insufficient consideration in industry
(and the educational system) for the pol-
i t i c a l , s o c i a l , human and ecological con-
sequences of Science and Technology.
Now this in Itself is not a startling new
revelation but it is we who are being
trained to perpetuate and perfect this
state of affairs. We are aware that, of a l l
people who could exert useful and pro-
perty directed pressure we would be the
best equipped.
The process of evolution of our
scheme can be summerised in a list of
points:-
(a) Although technologists of a l l d i s c i p -
lines can often see the problems and
consequences of Science and T e c h -
nology, they lack organisation and
political muscle to implement their
s o l u t i o n .
(b) The owreotly recognised organs of
the engineering world, the Institutes
are ineffectual p o l i t i c a l l y because of
their charters which debar them from
political a c t i v i t y . T h i s is because
they are registered a s c h a r i t i e s .
Steve Hinton
(c) T h e lack of engineers in the member-
ship of BSSRS indicates that it does
not cater for the industrial problems
that we would be concerned w i t h . For
example, they can push for control of
genetic engineering w h i l s t we c o n -
centrate on attacking " b u i l t in obso-
l e s c e n c e " . The ultimate goals are
undoubtedly the same, but the field
and direction of approach are very
different.
(d) A new form of a s s o c i a t i o n is required
therefore that can not only provide
p o l i t i c a l pressure to instigate change,
but equally v i t a l l y , can provide effec-
tive support for an individual member
who stands up for his principles and
suffers reprisals a s a consequence.
T h i s Intended trade-union type of
role i s essential if individuals are to
be able to c r i t i z e wherever they s e e
fault, without being constrained bv
'company loyalty' or job security
fears.
N e c e s s a r i l y our aims are rather vague
at the moment and we need to be out in
industry to be fully effective. We are not,
however, completely without experience
as the vast majority of us have spent a
year in industry before coming to c o l l e g e .
We are organising ourselves within our
college and contacting other universities
to involve like-minded people. Although
it was engineers who initiated this move-
ment, we feel that we can usefully work
with anyone with s i m i l a r aims involved
in industry regardless of q u a l i f i c a t i o n s .
We would be delighted to hear from
anyone with suggestions or who would
like to be involved. Anyone who i s Inter-
ested should contact Simon Wilson, 3rd
year undergraduate, Department of Mech-
anical Engineering, Imperial College of
Science and Technology, London 9W7
