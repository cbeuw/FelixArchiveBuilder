ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. I understand. It's the summer
term and you've got to do some work". You have got to
study for that scrap of wood pulp which promises that
you will be able to play a useful role in society when
you leave this vacuous academic haven. After all, that
letter pressed square of blotting paper is all you need
to become an instant success in Gradland, night?
But enough of this pondering as to which part of your
anatomy will receive the gloriously climactic 'rubber
stamp', let's examine what effect this stunningly
conscientious pen-pushing MIGHT have on the Union.
Tautological Iy speaking, an approximate estimate
would be:- apathy escalation and participation minimal
generally creating nauseous pains in the rear all round.
But whilst the summer term inevitably remains
psychologically jading, the issues facing students
remain the same but now they are seasonally stronger
due to the dwindling opposition. HOW DOES A 25%
INCREASE IN R E F E C T O R Y PRICES GRAB YOU?
Dramatic yes; sensationalist, no. Outrageous yes;
impossible, no. The end of this session will prove me
right in principle even if the figure is wrong. Consider
the FELIX Freshers' Issues of the past two years:-
FELIX No.340, October 2nd, 1973; headline: " R E F E C -
TORY PRICES TO B E INCREASED BY 5%." F E L I X
No .362, September 30th, 1974; headline: " R E F E C T O R Y
PRICES UP 17 P E R C E N T . " Would anyone good at
mathematical power series care to offer a prediction
for the next rise?

IF Y O U feel like going on a
calm peaceful, holiday ...join
the IC Y a c h t C lub! T h i s Easter,
N i c k Easby (our skipper),
Andrew M C F a r l a i n e , Martyn
Wells, Carol Workman and I, a l l
decided t o s a i l to Cherbourg
during the E a s t e r V a c . Carol
started most efficiently by
buying £20 worth of food only
to find that, on arriving at the
marina, the boys had a l s o
bought the food!(Have yourever
heard of a boat going for only a
week stacked with 3 c h i c k e n s ,
50 eggs, and 101b of butter?)
We set off on Sunday (after
having stopped off at Itchenor
for " l i g h t refreshment"). T h e
sea was amazingly calm, and I
remember thinking (as it w a s
my first time under sail), that
perhaps s a i l i n g w a s rather
boring. It w a s not long before
my suspicions were definitely
proved wrong!
Suddenly early Monday
morning the winds had changed
and were blowing at least a
force 6 . When we were in sight
of the French coast our Storm
J i b (sail!) blew out and w e
were forced to turn back, hoping
the gale, (which was by now a
steady force 8), would d i e
down. However it didn't! T h e
boat was swaying at 90 degree
angles every other second, and
waves were breaking over u s .
At this point one became
•somewhat bemused by the
situation! We had given the loo
up a s a bad job., jane found it
impossible to stay on i t , let
alone do anything on i t ! For us
girls sheer desperation enabled
us to cast away any inhibitions!
After 48 hours at s e a we
were far from healthy - (I never
realised a washing up bowl
could have s o many uses!!). We
were basically tired, cold, wet,
and s i c k (The presence of s o
much food didn't help!). So, w e
decided to send off distress
flares. Almost immediately a
French Merchant Ship turned
towards u s , and when it w a s
within hearing distance, a
rather confused "froggy-man"
shouted "Zee 'elicoptere eez
comeeng." After this s p i r i t s
were r a i s e d . T h e helicopter
arrived and a pilot, who found
it rather difficult to land on the
boat, eventually decended on to
the stern head seaward! He had
planned to take us girls off,
but, on seeing the state of the
boys, decided to leave us a l l
together. Hows that for an ego
boost! A n hour later Andrew
announced that a huge Royal
Navy Destroyer had arrived and
a life-boat was making its way
towards u s . Four of us were
taken off Icky (our yacht), to
the Destroyer, leaving N i c k
behind to brief the new scratch
crew for Icky.
We were hauled up on to T h e
HMS Sheffield (the destroyer),
only to be greeted by 300
uniformed sailors with cameras!
Apparently the fact that there
were 2 girls on board had
caused quite a stir! From this
moment on we were treated
royally. We were presented with
blankets, coffee, brandy, and
new gear. A t one stage I had
three officers undressing me-
Hows that for service??! We
had hot showers and were a l l
taken to the Ward Room to be
given a huge meal. T w o of the
crew had been ordered to vacate
their cabin s o that Carol and
I could sleep. We collapsed on
the bed only to find them
complete with water bottles!
We spent a day on the ship and
were taken round everywhere!
Some of the crew wrote us a
poem which we answered, only
to find it published in the
"Portsmouth News" when we
got back!
It i s s o easy to revel in the
excitement and forget a l l the
inconvenience and expense we
c a u s e d . Still we most sincerely
thank a l l those involved, and
on the part of the crew, do not
forget our highly competent
skipper!
