HAMLET GARDENS
SHOCK
"CLIQUE PERPETUATION-
ALLEGATIONS MADE
RESIDENTS IN Hamlet Gardens could be in for a shock
regarding their reapplications to reside there during the
1975/76 session. It appears that residents have been
promised places during the forth coming session by the
Warden of Hamlet Gardens dependent on whether they had
"behaved well" this year.

L A S T WEDNESDAY, about 4000 students from all over
the country marched the four miles from Lancaster's City
centre to the University campus where a rally was held'.
Over fifty student unions from as far away as Bath, Swansea,
Liverpool, Southampton, Aberdeem and East Anglia (whose
Students yesterday occupied part of their campus in support
of the Lancaster Students) attended the march and rally to
pledge their support for the victimised Lancaster students'.
Charles C l a r k e , the N U S
president-elect, l e d the march
and spoke at the r a l l y . In h i s
speech he urged student unions
up and down the country to
stand together i n the fight
against v i c t i m i s a t i o n a n d
e s p e c i a l l y to fight the educa-
tional cuts which were the root
cause of most student problems.
"This demonstration has
arisen out of the decision of
one man — vice-Chancellor
Charles Carter — to make his
students pay for the Govern-
ment's financial sabotage of
higher education", he s a i d . H e
a l s o urged a l l vice-chancellors
to dissociate themselves from
the action o f C h a r l e s Carter.
Several speakers from other
strife-torn campuses spoke at
the rally and a l l demanded that
the sentences be q u a s h e d . The
student body at L a n c a s t e r are
demanding that vice-chancellor
Charles Carter should leave
the U n i v e r s i t y .
The L a n c a s t e r University
Students U n i o n i s nearly
bankrupt because of the cost of
their campaign against the
U n i v e r s i t y authorities. A
c o l l e c t i o n w a s taken at the
rally to help ease the U n i o n ' s
financial position.

F O R I C
T H E T I T L E of 'Central
Electricity Generating Board
Professor of Corrosion Science'
has been conferred up'on Dr
P.R.Swann, Reader in Physical
Metallurgy in the Department of
Metallurgy and Materials
Science at the Imperial College
of Science and Technology,
with effect from 1 January 1975.
The Research Department of
C E G B has an a c t i v e programme
of corrosion science and w i s h e s
to support further good b a s i c
work with particular emphasis
on stress c o r r o s i o n . Professor
Swann i s a n authority i n this
field and the B o a r d has decided,
therefore, to provide funds
towards the support of Profess-
or Swann and his research for
a period o f five years, i n the
first i n s t a n c e . In addition, the
T h i s means i n practice that
those residents who had not
created any disturbance,
e s p e c i a l l y of a noisy k i n d ,
were guaranteed places for the
s e s s i o n 1975/6. Dave Salisbury,
the Student Residence Officer,
put forward proposals at the
C o u n c i l meeting on Monday
night that would e s s e n t i a l l y
preserve this status quo for
this year thus setting up a
' c l i q u e ' of residents i n Hamlet
Gardens.
The ensuing debate which
followed s a w Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
the I C U president, deliver a
very strong speech condemming
not only the action being taken
over this issue which directly
contradicts Union p o l i c y but
a l s o questioning Mr S a l i s b u r y ' s
stance on this i s s u e .
Mr Salisbury i t seemed had
succeeded i n misrepresenting
the initiatives taken by Mr
P h i l l i p s a n d Mrs Gerrard on
this matter and i m p l i e d , i n his
speech, that through their
a c t i o n s , he had been placed i n
the i n v i d i o u s p o s i t i o n o f p l a c i n g
an article i n F E L I X regarding
places i n Hamlet Gardens,
that d i d not correctly explain
the e x i s t i n g situation on
reapplications.
A working party i s being s e t
up to investigate the Hamlet
Gardens affair, although the
question of who the members
of this working party w i l l be,
has been deferred to the next
C o u n c i l meeting. T h i s w i l l be
the Joint C o u n c i l of Monday,
June 16th, 1975. In the inter-
mediate period, however, the
Union E x e c u t i v e w i l l take the
necessary decisions concerning
reapplicantsandnew a p p l i c a n t s
due to the urgency involved. ;
Board proposes to institute
some research studentships and
a s s o c i a t e s h i p s a t the C e n t r a l
E l e c t r i c i t y Research Laborat-
ories and to form a group with
e x i s t i n g Board staff undertaking
b a s i c work i n the f i e l d o f s t r e s s
corrosion with which Professor
Swann w i l l collaborate c l o s e l y .
