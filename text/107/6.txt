S U C C E S S AND F A I L U R E
In the U.L. T r i a l s , three members of I.C. dis-
tinguished themselves; Brian Curtis i n the furlong,
Terry Hyslop i n the 120 and 440 yds. hurdles events
and Dave Smith i n the Hop Step and Jump. The latter
produced a jump of 47'2", which unfortunately was
not allowed.
These three members of the Club, plus Les Locke,!
represented the University i n the match against
Paris on Sunday 5th. May. Here Smith won with a
triple-jump of 46'6". This, and Hyslop's perfor-
mance of 55-6 sees, i n the 440yds. hurdles, make
them rank i n the best twelve performers i n Great
Britain i n the last year. The previous evening i n
Paris may have had some stimulating! mental effect.
I.C. have had one match, versus Sheffield and
Birmingham Universities (at Sheffield), i n which
we were last. However, we introduced new songs
into their bar and enjoyed their Hop. Much, sport
(but no can-can dancing) was also exhibited oh
the early morning train home.
We had a weak team at the above meeting and
this i s partly due to the indifference shown by
members i n their support of the College club. In
some events we cannot even raise the required a
number of competitors and the points for placings
are thus being thrown away. More enthusiasm i s
required and a l l members are asked to keep a close
watch on the notice-board. New recruits of any
standard are s t i l l most welcome.

I.C.W.S.C. SHOCK THE JUDGES
Once again ICWSC f i e l d e d a team of gallant,
brave, dauntless, unfaultering sportswomen to
participate i n the U.L.Championships. They
fought their way t o the f i n a l s , t h e i r s p i r i t s
undamped by t o r r e n t i a l r a i n , there to give a
magnificent display of their a b i l i t y . As one
Judge was heard to remark to another during
the W>, "Oh, here ocme the other two. Do you
think they are going to finish?"And they d i d
(eventually) t o win 5 points f o r I.C.
One competitor i n the high Jump oalmly
announced her intention t o start jumping at
4'6", the I.C. entrant however flew with grace
and comparative ease over 3'6" t o f i n i s h equal
5th. The hurdler excelled herself by completing
the course leaving a l l the hurdles standing and
undamaged, to oome a valiant 5th.
The long Jump f i n a l i s t , apart from being
surrounded by cameramen clamouring to take her
photograph, also learnt how t o do the long
Jump, never before having attempted such a
magnificent feat.
The results? f e l l ICWSC came 6th f o r the
U.L.Challenge Cup and a close t h i r d f o r the
Sherwood-Factor Cup.
Special mention should he mads o f Janet Peter-
sen who came 2nd. i n the 880.yds. and has been
asked t o represent London University i n ths
B r i t i s h Universities competition.

The business of organising a tour i n S.v.
France next Christmas was put i n the hands of
next years oapable secretary before the mooting
r e t i r e d t o the bar. Here Les Wilson, our Corn-
w a l l tour coach driver, l e d a convivial evening
and l a t e r the assembled company departed i n h i s
dilapidated coach to a l o c a l hostelry)
Despite the fact that this major event was
held much earlier i n the season this year, College
Records were set up i n the Shot Putt (J.W.S.
Newman - 40' Si""), Javelin (H.T.L. Evans -
171'8'') and the mile medley relay (Guilds -
3 mins 42.4 sees.). "Best Sports Performances"
were set up i n two other events. One was i n the
120 yards hurdles by Terry Hyslop i n 15.5 sees,
and the other was i n the 1-mile by John Evans
(4 mins 13.1 sees) who made other runners re-
semble cripples.
Rumoured lack of training of the'R.C.S.
tug-of-war team was disproved when they beat
Gpilds In the final after a lengthy l s t pull
which brought spectators to their feet i n
excitement.
Brian Curtis completed the double i n the
sprints (10.2 and 23.3sees) and Les Locke won
bo^h the 440 yards (51.4 sees.) and the -jt-mile
(2 mins. 1.8 sees.).
With George Schenkel, the holder, missing
a bruised knee, the pole vault t i t l e was taken
by A.W. Smith who cleared 9'6" i n excellent
style.
Both jumps were of a good standard, John*
Hobson producing 20' 10$-" i n the long jump and
T. Hyslop clearing 5*T i n the high jump.
Other notable performances were by t r i p l e -
jumper Dave Smith who was 2nd. i n the javelin
with 160.'7'.'i only 3' short of the old record,
and Pete Rayment who led most of the way on the
•Jr-mlle (2nd. i n 2 mins 2.8 sees.).
Congratulations to Guilds who won the
Challenge Shield easily, with R.C.S. second.
The few spectators who did turn up to
support their colleges were treated to an
enjoyable afternoon's sport i n glorious
weather.
CRICKET
The 1st. XI has not made a good start to the
season, due mainly to the instability of i t s bat-
ting. However this early season rustiness i s
beginning to disappear,as seen last Saturday,when
I.C. h i t 154-8 declared against O.Sinjuns, and
lost a very close match by two wickets i n the
last over of the day. Murden (53) and Shepherd
(40) were the main contributors to the total.
Against L.S.E., the l s t . XI lost by one run,
the last eight wickets f a l l i n g for 12 runs.. In
the match against Reading University they scored
207-6, whilst I.C. only managed to make 109-9.
R.A.E.Farnborough were no match for the I.C. bow-
lers and were a l l out for 34, I.C. winning by
eight wickets. The most successful bowler to date
has been N.Bbattl, while J.Carter has bowled well
but has suffered the fate of a l l slow bowlers -
dropped catches.
The 2nd.XI has played three matches so far,
a l l of which have bean drawn.
U.L. C H A M P I O N S H I P S
In the f i n a l s of the U.L.Championships on Sat.
11th May at Hotspur Park, I.C. narrowly l o s t the
Roseberry Challenge ;Cup t o U.C. by 81 pts. to 70.
the r e s u l t would have probably been much closer
but f o r a motor-cycle accident to Hyslop on h i s
way to the track to appear i n four f i n a l s , and
the absence of Locke, playing football f o r Scot-
land. Ve oan look forward to next year with con-
siderable confidence, as several of ear freshers
performed extremely w e l l , especially I n the
events i n which we have not had f i n a l i s t s f o r
several years, Curtis 2nd. i n the 220 and t h i r d
i n the 100yds. and Newman 4th i n the shot. Evans,
winning ths mile i n 40412.6 sees and Smith 1st
i n the hop-step-snd-Jump, were our only i n d i v i d -
ual winners, and deserve congratulations on
their performances. Other I.C. positions were

REGATTAS
The regatta season has started. On Saturday,
Hay 11th. the 2nd. VIII had some hard luck when
they lost the Junior Eights final at Putney
Regatta. Having beaten Thames Tradesmen and
London Transport by.4 lengths, and Putney town
R.C. by i length. The I.C- crew raced Vesta R.C.
i n the f i n a l . This resulted in a dead heat and
a re-row was neccesary. The I.C. crew was un-
fortunately too spent and lost by 7 length. I t
was excellent racing and we should soon have our
revenge.
Tha third eight had a close race i n their
Maiden eights event. They lost by six feet from
Parksids and Lensbury. Parkside bad previously
beaten I.C. by two lengths at Hammersmith, so
this showed an improvement for the less ex-
perienced crew.
Martin Gaylord. sculling the Junior-Senior
Sculls final had a bad start i n the rough water
and lost four lengths a distance.
.Cm Ray 25th. U.L .B.C. w i l l hold their regat-
ta. I.C. hope to sweep the board clean so come
and support your crews.
