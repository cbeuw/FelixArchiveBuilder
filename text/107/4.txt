Beginning a new.eerial of love and
paaaion sat i n tha heart of the Onion.
Leonora stood on the edge of the
dance f l o o r a pathetic figure - mousey
h a i r Just touching her drooping shoulders,
her s q u i n t i n g eyes misty with the unshed
t e a r s , her mouth a l i t t l e too large f o r
true beauty. Those swimming eyes f o l -
lowed the dashing Rugger captain as he
awept by laughing g a i l y oyer the shoulder
of a b e a u t i f u l woman, and i t was l i k e *
k n i f e turning i n her tortured breast .
There was a ohoklng sensation i n her
throat, and rushing from the h a l l she
threw herself down i n the Ladies Cloak-
room, the b i t t e r tears f l o w i n g unoheoked
down her ashen oheeks. Soon the sobs
wracked her body less o f t e n , and the con-
v u l s i v e shudderings ceased. She sat up
and looked at her r e f l e c t i o n i n the mirror.
How had she come to t h i s sorry state?
Her thoughts went baok to the day she
had f i r s t met Snotty as hia friends a f f e c -
t i o n a t e l y c a l l e d him - the t a l l handsome
Snotty who only ten minutes previously had
out her dead out there on the dance f l o o r .
It had mot been a romantic meeting -
the r e f e c t o r y queue and Leonora s t r u g g l i n g
to manage a lunch t r a y , a bottle of m i l k ,
a book.and a purse. Suddenly Snotty had
appeared i n front of Leonora - soarf slung
r a k i s h l y around h i s neok, d u f f l e coat askew
and with that one aided smile whioh she had
come to love so much, he had bowed1
low and
in one sweeping movement r e l i e v e d her of
her purse. "Tou look so beautiful i n that
white dress with the pea green soup s t a i n
showing o f f your slender neok and shoulders
- I can't r e s i s t helping you." He tou-
ched her elbow and a shiver went through
her whole body whi«h set her pulses beat-
ing and sent the blood rushing to her
oheeks. "But I hardly know you," Leonora
stammered, but by the end of lunch she
f e l t that she had known him f o r a long
time. They had so many things i n common
- they both read books, ate f i s h and
ohips and drank tea; they both l i k e d wash-
ing i n the morning and shaving only onoe a
day - oh, there were so many things.
When at the end of the meal he had asked
her to walk with him across the quadrangle
i t had seemed the only n a t u r a l thing to de.
Her thoughts aped on over the happy
days that had followed. - t h e i r f i r s t r i d e
on a bus together, t h e i r f i r s t f i l m t o -
gether, and then the f i r s t time he had k i s -
sed her - Just four months a f t e r t h e i r
f i r s t meeting. They had been toalecture
on rug making and had walked back to the
s t a t i o n through the subway. Whe n they
were nearly at the end Snotty had suddenly
stopped and turned, and sweeping her faee
with hia gasa he caught her ahouldera aad
his smouldering eyes looked deep into hers
as he said s o f t l y , h i s voice trembling,
"Oh, Leonora - come and. have ooffee with
me tonight?" and than he had kissed her
very gently on the l i p s , but she oould
f e e l the burning paasion behind hia touohi
andshe had gone gladly to ooffee with him
beoause she knew with a l l her heart and
mind that she would never be as t h i r s t y aa
she was at that moment.
And now - Snotty was out there danc-
ing with another, looking into another
woman's eyes, saying to her a l l those l i t -
t l e thing* whioh mean so much.
"Oh Snotty, Snotty", she whispered,
"how oeuld you spurn my love?"
She oolleoted her crash helmet and
o i l s k i n and waked out of the Cloakrooal
Ouvstte she bumped into W i l l y - the boy
who worked on the bench next to hers.
W i l l y had made i t obvious from the f i r s t
day that they had shared the rabbit's r e c -
tus that Leonora was the only g i r l f o r him}
but to her W i l l y had alwaya been Just the
boy with the best g a l l bladder and nothing
But now he took her hand with a
f r i e n d l y gesture, and her eyes . f e l l to the
f l o o r beneath h i s penetrating gaae. Onoe
again the pearly drops welled up i n her
ohina blue eyes and voioe cracking she mur-
mured, " W i l l y , what oan I do?" W i l l y ga-
thered her into his arms. His head bent
over hers, and she looked up at him eyea
elazed, l i p s s l i g h t l y parted At _
that moment the door was f l u n g open and
Snotty stood there, muscles r i p p l i n g , nos-
t r i l s f l a r i n g . Leonora f e l l baok s t a r t l e d
What does Snotty want?
What does W i l l y want?

Like many of the f i t t i n g s i n t h i s Hew
Union of ours, the new l i f t appears to be
wholly inadequate. I t w i out of aetion
reeently f o r several days, and even when
on* oaa nae the thing everything i s not we
w a l l , f a r one t h i n g , the doors take an
• Interminable length o f time to open and i t
appears that i f the l i f t atioka between

However, we ar* informed that the porters

irresponsible couples refrained f r o a

Perhaps the fact that there waa no
women present at the aeoOnd year Engine-
ers dinner r e o e n t l y , aooouhta f o r the
exoessively rowdy behaviour whioh oaused
Ted Smith, at one stage,to refuae to serve
anyone. While t h i s column i s not averse
to "a b i t of aport" now and then, throwing
glasses over one's ahoulder, we f e e l , i a
taking things a b i t to f a r ) I n c i d e n t a l l y ,
we feear that making making cutting remarks
is g e t t i n g p r e t t y unpopular with t h i s group.
Talking about Engineers, at the dinner pro-
ceeding the Engineers' B a l l , Mr. J . L e B — t
was heard to aay that he had f a i l e d to
seduce (sorry - induoe) the Bean'a eeoretary
to do something or other.
Who waa tha young lady who waa seen
to disappear smartly through a refeotory
window a f t e r being i n v i t e d to ooffee i n
room 17, Old Hostel on Sports Bay? And
while on the subject of young l a d i e s , our
pet subjeot, the following remark was heard
from a young lady s o o l o g i a t , " I f you w i l l
lend me a s u i t of armour, I w i l l go to the
earnival with you".
Some Miners were present at a s t r i p -
tease d i s p l a y given by some inmates of the
hostel f o r young l a d i e s , whioh i s v i s i b l e
from the upper r e f e o t o r y . Inoldentally
i t i s believed that i f one turns about,
the view there ian't bad e i t h e r . Perhaps
these were the same miners who oame baok
from t h e i r survey t r i p i n Cornwall leaving

bly patoh up r e l a t i o n s with the Cornish f o l k .
As readers are already f u l l y aware,
the Queen Mother Is opening tha Roderio H i l l
Building on May 28th. Her detective i s be-
l i e v e d to have already made several security
hunts about the plaoe, to f i n d suitable
places f o r dropping arohiteotural clangers.
Two high o f f i o i a l s of the governing body were
being shown round by a prominent planner.
The elder o f f i c i a l was heard to say, "Oh,
i t ' s a nuisanoe having a l l these door*. •
•
Tou r e a l i s e that these w i l l a l l hay* to be
open so that ahe oan walk straight through,
because no one can walk In front of her.
And what about theae?" (Pointing to a p a i r
of awing doors leading to a dark oorridor)
The planner r e p l i e d , " I think we oan arrange
that the appropriate doors are open, as f o r
these doors, she doesn't have to go down
there, so they oan remain shut." L i t t l e does
Her Majesty know how her v i s i t s are arranged.
Inoidentally i t i e also brought to our
notiee that Mr. Len Sweett, the stage e l e o t -
r i o i a n , has to have 27 passes to reach the
