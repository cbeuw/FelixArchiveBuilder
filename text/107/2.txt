THE EDITORS ALARM
" W i l l 70a w r i t * a l i t t l * sooner,"said the Editor to his awn,
"Press day i s now upon us and wa havn't raised a pen.
Think how angrily our readers and subscribers would protest
I f they hadn't got t h e i r Friday rag with whioh they always jest."
W i l l yon, won't you, w i l l you, won't you, w i l l you start to writ*?
W i l l you, won't you, w i l l you, won't you, w i l l yon start to writ*?
"Ton r e a l l y have no notion how demented I s h a l l be,
I f they w r i t * and t e l l me even one* they hate the gats of me."
But a l l the board with one accord immediately said
"Ton know i t r e a l l y i s through us that F e l i x can be read."
Can't you, won't you, cant' you, won't you, can't you start to write?
Can't you, won't you, can't you, won't you, can't you start to write?
" I t matters l i t t l e at what time we a l l see f i t to come
For no matter when we start, the job i s always done."
At l a s t the suffering Editor decides HE w i l l begin,
And h i s merry band of helpers decide they w i l l j o i n i n .
W i l l you, won't you, w i l l you, wont you, won't you start to type*
W i l l you, won't you, w i l l yon, won't you, won't you start to type/

While none of the characters i n this photo-
graph i s actually carrying the Times, they are
a l l Top People. Felix offers no prize|to the
f i r s t to identify them. Their separate l i k e -
nesses have each adorned these papers before,
and they now do so together because of the it
editor's metaphysical belief i n emergent evo-
lution: the doctrine, that the assembly may add
up to more than the sum of the parts.
The parts themselves are intrinsically
remarkable. The seated,sages,Tony Goodings,
John Hart and Mike Rutter, who guide the
destinies of R.C.S., Guilds and Mines, are each
formidable figures. The last two,particularly,
bring a wider vision to Onion discussions from
their exotic backgrounds i n Rhodesia and Lancas-
hire. A l l have admired the versatile mastery of
this trio at freshers dinners, Union meetings,
carnivals,and i n the dignified old world atmosphere
of the various formal dances. Then, loomiag f
from the insets, there are the less-publicised
figures of retired oarsman Kim Ash and barn-
storming Les Allen. These gentlemen, the Chair-
men of A.C.C. and S.C.C., spin a mysterious finan-
cial web i n the background, and distribute vast
sums of Union money to the clubs.
Standing l e f t , and much improving the picture,
Miss Wendy Pipe, the President of I.C.W.A.
Seldom can this depressed class have had a l i v e -
l i e r leader, or one so accurate with a saucepan-
ful of water.
Standing right, Union Secretary Andy Levine,
one-tlae Guilds president, twice Student Orator,
and now (supreme honour!) Student Bedell-elect
for May 28th.
Centre, bestriding the whirlwind and direct-
ing the stora, the originator of the Kitchener
Doctrine of 'give'em hell'. The Union President,
a man of foresight (tipped Crepello for the
Derby at Christmas), has served i n many offices,
but never to such valuable (and sometimes de-
vastating) effect as now.
Above the individual eccentricities of this
exceptional octet rises their collective cont-
ribution to student democracy and independence
during this year of re-establishment and re-
consolidation. Tha Union depends on the willing
and capable, characters who man i t s (frequently
tedious) coamittees and give up much of their
spare time to man them.If the electorate picks
as good a collection of forthright spokesmen for
next session i t w i l l have done well.

ENGINEERS' BALL
Th* Engineer's B a l l l a s t Friday night
turned out t c be i t s usual unrivalled sue*
cess. I t started at a few minutes paat
eight whan a somewhat inebriated top table
stumbled i n , and after finding t h e i r places,
th* dinner was served. This was an excellent
meal - with shrimps, chicken, etc. The only
fault with t h * dinner was that the main dish
provided was beer. One or two of the ladies
seeaed to l i k e t h i s , but on the whole they
preferred to renaln dry.
When the dinner f i n a l l y finished the band
had already been playing for over an hour
to the few non-diners. The arrangement of
th* Concert H a l l was well done, with arm-
obnivs and tables suitably arranged. The
dancing lasted u n t i l 3 sua., the floor being
never empty and never crowded. Our corresp-
ondent considers that this was on* of t h *
best social events f o r a long tine.
FAIR DEAL FOR MILLER
KEITH MILLER, continued.
Last year Miller was rightly highly
praised for his work i n helping to found the
Exploration Board which was one of the college
showpieces. This year when trouble i s i n the
air, the college even though assured of the
good publicity from the Expedition tried to
hush up the whole business. Apparently loyalty
to i t s students does not extend to the risk of
a l i t t l e publicity. Hot that such publicity
would have any adverse effects on the college
for i s i t not reasonable to suppose that every-
one would sympathise with a college seeking to
have such a ban removed or at least to be inform-
ed of the reasons why the ban was placed/' As
Mr. Miller has been heard to say i n the Bar,
"lou know who your real friends are when you
really need them".
It i s reassuring to know that the democratic
machine does operate and that secret governmental
decisions can be reversed and someone had to
climb down. Readers of Felix w i l l rejoice in
this and wish Keith and his merry band the very
best of luck i n them thar h i l l s .
