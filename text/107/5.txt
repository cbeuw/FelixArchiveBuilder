The many drinking fountains and oattie
troughs I n tha Borough of Kensington are a
legacy whioh dates baok nearly a century.
Within ons mile of the Albert H a l l there
e x i s t more than twenty drinking fountains,
three of whioh are integrated with cattle
troughs. Surprisingly the majority s t i l l
function and most of the fountains are
f i t t e d with some sort o f battered a l l o y
drinking mug hung on a length of chain.
Th* provision of t h i s fitment enables one
to drink i n a c i v i l i s e d manner - instead of
suffering the indignity o f presenting one's
face to a wavering j e t of cold water.
Thirsty dumb animals are not neglected
either. The production model drinking foun-
t a i n supplied by the Metropolitan Drinking
Fountains and Cattle Troughs Association,
(M.D.F. and C.T. Assn.) has a small foot-
bath i n the base of the fountain from whioh
lower creatures may drink.
Many of the l o c a l drinking fountains are
Interesting as examples of monumental work
and as sources of l o c a l history. The o l d
fountain opposite the t a x i rank on Kensing-
ton Gore shows the charitable nature of the
l o c a l residents. 'Presented t o the Parish
by an inhabitant of Kensington i n 1859' i t
i s now believed t o provide tea-water f o r
the nearby taxi-drivers' canteen. The c a t t l e
trough beside the canteen bears the i n s c r i p -
t i o n , 'be kind and merciful t o a l l animals;
i n memory of Esther Benjamin, f824 -1879.'
Through the M.D.F. and C.T. Assn. the Ben-
jamin family have been associated with other
c a t t l e troughs; on* i n Bayswatar Road i s

Just o f f the Broad Walk In Kensington
Gardens a bronze fountain was 'erected i n

whioh i n 1856 was named St. Gorvor'a Well
