NOW GRANTED AFTER QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT
LAST WEEK SAW A HAPPT BSDING TO WHAT HOST HE OWE OP THE MOST SENSATIONAL AMD MYSTERIOUS EVENTS
AT I.C. FOE SOME TEARS. KEITH MILLER, THE PRESIDENT OF GUILDS UNION LAST TEAR AND A PRIME MOTER
IN THE FOUNDING OF THE EXPLORATION BOARD, WAS THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION H THE BOOSE OF COMMONS.
Daring the debate i t was announced that the
ban on M i l l e r , imposed by the Pakistan Government,!
had been withdrawn. A l l I.C. , knowing of the
tremendous untiring effort he has made i n get-
ting the forthcoming expedition to the Himalayas
on a sound footing, w i l l rejoice at this news.
There can be l i t t l e doubt, however, that some
of the facts behind the story are truly amazing.
I t appears that news of Millar having been
banned was received some weeks ago by the senior
members of the Exploration Board. Some attempt
was made to have the decision reversed, both
obviously meeting with some d i f f i c u l t i e s , they
reached a conclusion that this was impossible.
It i s noteworthy at this stage to realize that
during this period, neither student members,
nor any I.C. Union Officer, nor EVEN MILLER aU-
SELF, were informed. Eventually the Exploration
Board informed Keith that, much as they natural-
ly sympathised with him, there was l i t t l e or \
nothing he could do about i t . In an endeavour
to keep the whole event quiet, and so that no-one
need ever know, i t was even suggested that Keith
should resign because of " i l l - h e a l t h " . Evan
without knowing why Keith had been banned, the
Board advised him to accept the decision with as
l i t t l e fuss as possible.
For those who know Keith personally, i t w i l l
be no surprise to hear that he did not take too
kindly to this treatment. He visited the M.P.
for Blackburn (his home town), Mrs. Barbara
Castle, and the High Commissioner for Pakistan
in England. He asked Mrs. Castle to raise the
matter in the House of Commons. In addition,
Keith approached several College dignitaries
for help i n providing references that might
lend weight to his appeal. The student pre-
sidents and the Warden of the Hostel readily
agreed to help, and letters were sent to Mrs.
Castle, the High Commlsloner for Pakistan, and
Mr. A.H. Albu, who i s an M.P. on the governing
body of the College. The letters explained
that, he Is not only a member of the expedition,!
but also i t s originator.
M i l l e r had been a valuable and industrious
member of college society during his stay at I.C.
The letters asked that the ban be withdrwn or
else at least some reasonable explanation be
given.
The lively discussion that took place i n
the House on May 9th. was f u l l y reported i n the
Times next day and mentioned i n a number of the
other daily papers. Mrs Castle asked a ma bar
of questions about the nature of information
that i s passed by the B r i t i s h Government to the
Governments of the Commonwealth i n such c i r -
cumstances and the right of appeal i n such a
case. She also asked questions about the Miller
case i n particular. The discussion included a
speech from Mr. Albu who spoke up for Keith and
Mr. Callaghan commented that the whole case
smacked of McCarthy!SB.
A copy of Hansard has been purchased and
placed i n the reading room for a l l those whs
would Ilka to read the proceedings l a f u l l .
Tha result,as we now know was a resounding
triumph for Keith and his band of determined
supporters. Mr. Alport (Under Secretary of
State for Commonwealth Ralatioas) announced that
the Pakistan Govexnaaat had withdrawn i t s
objection to M i l l e r (this waeprasuaabiy baaed on
information supplied to them by tha B r i t i s h
Government).

WHEN B A T T E R S E A C A M E TO S. KEN
After months of comparative peace,
ragging broke out agata as a r e s u l t of the
f l y i n g v i s i t to the Union of a Battersaa
Poly p u b l i c i t y team of "hot gospellers".
Shortly a f t e r 1 p.m. a fawn Morris
truok was seen to approaoh the Union at
high speed from an E a s t e r l y d i r e c t i o n .
The p u b l i c i t y campaigners were dumped out-
side the B o l t Arohway and a a t i o l p a t i n g the
tyre d e f l a t i o n a r y and sparking plug remo-

then moved to a safer parking plaoe. The
ten and maidens from B i t t e r s e a dressed i n

A number of anomalies merit contemplations -
1) Why did the senior members of tha Exploration
Beard sot inform the student awafeers of the
decision considerably earlier, than they did.
2) How was tha conclusion reached that the ban
was irrevocable. I t seems somehow strange
that in a week Mr. Miller has managed to reverse
the decision not te grant him a visa, when the
Exploration Board had failed to do so. Kitch was
informed that raising the matter In an endeavour
to change the decision might only lead to mora
troubles and Keith jeopardised even more rf the
ban became widespread knowledge.
On the face of i t there can be only one answer
that the college i n trying not to dirty i t s nose
with any public exposure aid i t * hast initially
t i keep the whole procedure 'la camera'. Con-
sidering the position i n which the college finds
itself, that was understandable as long as Keith
did not know. However, when he had declared his
Intention to have the whole matter thrashed oat,
i f need be at the highest level irrespective ef
incidental risks, i t was the college that should
have stood at his shoulder and given his whole
hearted support.

ereseed the Beit Quadrangle and entered
the Union Bulldog by the door near the bar
Hopes f o r some goad sport In the bar were
however dashed when the1
party turned l e f t
into the lounge. They made a short but
noisy tour of the ground f l o o r without
being molested but on reaching the Beit
Arohway found that their way was barred.
Hoses belonging to the stone cleaning oom-
pany came i n very handy and the oooupants
of the Hew Hostel had t h e i r water dispen-
sing reoeptaoles primed. The Poly hop
p u b l i o l s e r s , mae and female, escaped a f t e r
the b r i e f but energetic aquatic sport ses-
sion whloh followed and very l i t t l e e f f o r t
was made to prevent t h e i r departure by
truok. This vehicle nude a return run
past the Union at high speed s c a t t e r i n g
the assembled crowd.
At t h i s point, c i v i l war broke out.
Long standing differences of opinion bet-
ween the f l o o r s of the hostel became appa-
rent as h o s t i l i t i e s broke out. The orowd
in the road were treated to an enjoyable
display of water throwing. The President
of I.C.W.A. undeterred by one drenohing,
now protected by a bathing cap, reappeared
at her window and gave vent to her feelings
by douahg thorn s h e l t e r i n g under an umbrella
on the baloony. Several blue helaeted
gentlemen were observed i n the background^
and one waa seen to enter the Union.
On the opposite side of the road a
considerable amount of water leaked frea
the top floors of the Aero department.
However, tha aeronauts discovered that the
pressure in the f i r s hose was lneaffialeat
for th* water te reach tha other side e*
the road. A l l hostilities ceased at 2p.a.
