It i s unfortunate that Dai G r i f f i n
should he away from h i s regular post a t a
time when the news has reaohed national
proportions - we do not ask him to be i n
any way responsible f o r the opinions ex-
pressed, although we suspect that he w i l l
agree with them.
The news of Keith K i l l e r and the
sentiments i t provokes are dealt with else-
where but there i s one point we would l i k e
to emphasise. The skeleton i n the Gov-
ernment department's cupboard has boon w e l l
and t r u l y r a t t l e d by Mrs. Barbara Castle)
such i s the means by which democratic rule
i s maintained. There s t i l l remains the
smell i n our own back-yard - not wishing
to base our argument on more than fact ( a l -
though d e t a i l e d rumours seem almost beyond
d e n i a l ) , we would underline the attitude of
authority described on the front page.
"Suggest you resign because of i l l
health." "Mo-one need ever know".
"Advise you to acoept the decision with no
fuss." The B r i t i s h Parliament quickly
raised the 3tone that the College was afraid
- yes, AFRAID - to touch. And a very
unpleasant a f f a i r was found underneath*
We do not seek to defend M i l l e r , however
much we may sympathise with him. We only
demand that those responsible f o r a s s i s t i n g
him to obtain a f a i r hearing be made to
r e a l i s e how badly they l e t him down. In
doing so, they have caused rather than
avoided the adverse p u b l i c i t y which seems
to be there r u l i n g passion and made the
student body d i s t r u s t the administration
under which they f i n d them-selves.
I.C. Union Meetings have be*n f a i r l y
w e l l attended t h i s year - f o r the Union
to represent us a l l , t h i s i s a very neo-
essary f a c t o r . Despite exam, pressure
i t should not be too much to expect to see
you on the 23rd. May. (Anyway, i t would
please K i t c h '•).
A l a s t serious note - F e l i x takings
In Guilds entranoe were nearly ten s h i l l i n g s
short. We assume t h i s i s due t o copies
not being paid f o r (rather than theft of,
cash) and would remind readers that i f we
are to remain independent the few s h i l l i n g s
whioh separate us from bankruptcy are very
v i t a l .
With that I hand you baok to Dai -
and the best of luok t

Sear Sir,
Tour correspondent, nr. gecchial i s
talking through the top ef his head whan he
says that our privacy w i l l not be endangered
by woman drinking i n the bar. At present
the bar i s one of the two places into which
these insidious creatures have not j e t i n -
filtrated. There are already several strains
of mala flora and fauna i n our bar which
frankly make ue baulk; women would be the
last straw.
This apart, English Womanhood snould be
protected from the sight of the wireless and
milk bottle smashing element i n their cups.
BO Sir, as anyone who has been to U.C. on
"Union Night" w i l l agree, keep tha monsters
out.

INDEPENDENT COMMENT
T H R E E POINT L A N D I N G
BY Daedalus
It i s with a certain amount of disillusion-
ment that I s i t down to pen the second i n instal-
ment i n this series. The f i r s t , i n the last issue,
was expected to promote a flood of angry letters.
The response has been negligible.
Having been i n the College for a sufficient
time to justify an opinion, i t i s mine that the
student population shows an unwarranted lack of
familiarity with the rules of English grammar
and with spelling. One may find examples of this
deficiency i n this very journal(although many of
the errors are typographical ones, i t must be
asserted). The opinion i s quite widely held that
schooling up to G.C.E. may be blamed.
Passing from walking to running, examination
of a f a i r sample of reports by undergraduates and
postgraduates of their practical work shows that
industry might benefit i f some formal instruction
were given i n technical writing at the University
stage. There have been Third year courses i n
Guild's devoted to this aim, but this appeal i s
for more widespread instruction. The writing of
Dear Six,
Last Issue's letter from Kr. J.C.Wright
prompts me to add a further query concerning
the college crest. Why does the word SKIIZIA
have to be written with such a mixture of
scripts? Also I would Like to know s reason,
able translation of the motto "SCIENTIA -
BtFJERII - DBCTS - IT - T0TANEN" as I have yet
to find one though I have asked several peopl*.
Another point which 1 have noticed con-
cerns the R.C.S. ties. Which way up should
the white and purple stripes be? I have seen
specimens both of the possible ways.

paragraphs are intended as an object lesson and
not as an example.
The topic of the "brownbagger" i s worth
keeping alive and especially comes into prominence
at examination times. I f a man decides to work as
hard as he i s able, and to resist the temptations
of the playing field and the bridge-table, and
through strength of character adheres to his dec-
ision, surely his conduct Is to be admired. On
the other hand the weak-willed person who lapses
into "brownbagging" because i t i s the easiest
way by which he can reach examination standard,
and who i s too lazy to be tempted by extra-cur-
ricular activities, i s nothing but a parasite.
The next time you sporting readers pitch into a
beery denouncement of "brownbaggers"' remember
that there are many species of worm and at least
two species of bookworm.
