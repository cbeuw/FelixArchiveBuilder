The Hot Spot
A drifter arrives in a small town, so
small infact, he's informed, there's
only t w o things to do and just one
if y o u don't have a TV...Left with only
this one thing to do, he gets involved
with two w o m e n and then his troubles
really begin.
The Hot Spot, directed by Dennis
Hopper, follows the unscrupulous trail of
Harry Madox (Don Johnson) a charismatic
kinda guy who, finding himself i n the
blistering, godforsaken Texas town,
quickly gets a job as a car salesman. T h e
two w o m e n he comes across, one good,
one bad, are both beautiful and complex.
In the good corner is Gloria Harper,
(Jennifer Connelly), a naive, young
accountant whose life is mysteriously
complicated by blackmail. In the bad
corner is Dolly Harshaw (Virginia
Madsen), his new boss's conniving,
impossibly alluring wife.
The film has blackmail, heat, arson,
heat, passion, heat, murder and a great
bluesy soundtrack. B y the way, did I
mention it's a tad o n the w a r m side?)
Based o n Charles Williams' (Dead Calm)
novel, Hell Hath No Fury, it's a film i n
which all the characters find their o w n
levels in the end.
Johnson's cool, Madsen's hot, Connelly's
cute and Hopper has a good eye, two i n
fact. Advertised as 'noir' for the 90s,
they're not lying. The Hot Spot has a
simple intensity that draws y o u in. If y o u
liked Body Heat starring William Hurt
and Kathleen Turner you'll enjoy The Hot
Spot.

Symphony Orchestra
This was a concert of contrasting
halves in more than one sense. T h e
programme was divided between
two late eighteenth century pieces before
the interval a n d an early twentieth
century symphony afterwards. It also
divided equally between the excruciating
and the exhilarating.
The orchestra began Haydn's
Symphony no 70 in D with a rich w a r m
sound and performed the first two
movements competently, but both their
tone and composure deserted them i n the
third movement and were only slightly
regained b y the end of the piece.
Imogen Cooper bravely executed
Mozart's Piano concerto no 22 in E flat,
faced as she was with support from an
orchestra and conductor rapidly losing
control. B y the end of the first
movement, the lack of balance and some
sloppy playing from the strings (especially
in the opening twenty seconds) had
A i r A m e r i c a
REVIEWS
convinced m e that writing anything i n E
flat was a mistake. T h e final movement
was performed more creditably and the
woodwind were noticeable for not lapsing
into the general disintegration. Against
this Cooper managed sufficient sensitivity
in the piece to make it merely
unpleasant.
After the interval, the orchestra swelled
to full size a n d the change to the drama
of Walton's Symphony no 1 in B flat
minor altered the mood completely. T h e
playing was crisp a n d full of gusto, doing
justice to this magnificent score. Walton's
work rivals anything being produced o n
the continent at the time a n d this half of
the programme more than compensated
for the disappointments of the first half.
Having been prepared to write off the
CBSO at the interval, I must say that they
can play - but only if they choose their
programme carefully.

Many M e l Gibson fans will find this
film a severe disappointment. Not
once is his Gluteus Maximus
exposed to the adoring masses, a n d he
never once fires a gun (despite a rather
threatening w a v e of an U z i (9mm?)). So
what does he do in the film then? Well,
fly quite a bit, crash occasionally and
generally act slightly barmy i n a Buddhist
sort of w a y .
He is a pilot for the CIA's covert airline
acting in Laos, next to Vietnam, during
the Vietnam war. Officially they are not
there, despite the fact they are flying out
of an Airbase that is effectively the
second largest city in the country. They
fly aircraft illegal in the states, dropping
anything from pigs to fire arms over local
villages. Unfortunately they are also
helping transport drugs for a local
warlord w h o is helping them subsidise
this war. W h e n a senator arrives o n a
fact finding tour it is obvious that a
scapegoat is going to be needed to take
the heat off the real organisers of this
illicit trade. Gene (Mel Gibson) and newly
arrived Billy (Robert D o w n e y Jr.) seem
the obvious candidates.
This film is one of the v e r y few that I
have seen that manages to combine both
entertainment a n d message. The film is
funny w h e n it needs to be, serious w h e n
it needs to be and exciting w h e n it needs
to be. T h e antics of M e l a n d the rest of
the pilots, (the sort of people w h o justify
the cliche 'living o n the edge'), encompass
elements of both comedy and tragedy,
while their superiors m i x humor with
threat. A l l too often films w h i c h refuse to
pin their colour to any set genre end up
muddled and lost, but this has avoided
that trap.
A C o m e d y / A c t i o n / A d v e n t u r e that
taught me a lot about the hypocrisy of
the A m e r i c a n Government, a n d loss of
belief, while entertaining m e . This
deserves to be a blockbuster.
