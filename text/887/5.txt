Contrary to what the Careers Fair
Disinformation Department
would have you think........
Schlumberger
is SHLUM-BER-JAY, not Sclumberger or Scrumburger or even Scum-Bergers
and the good news for Engineers is that although spelling the company
name can be a little tricky, our engineering graduates are spared the usual
decision of whether to stay close to the technology that fascinates them and
in which they have excelled so far, or whether to move out into
management-style functions which are perceived - often quite rightly - to be
the most effective way up to the top.
In Schlumberger, despite the colours of our logo, you don't have to face
such black-and-white decisions.
Schlumberger operates a policy of promotion from within which means that
all the senior managers (and we are talking about all the way to the
chairman) have come up from the graduate engineer level. While providing
unsurpassed management opportunities for young engineers, our system of
career development also means that employees are not pigeon-holed or
likely to experience one-way tickets into support functions. A typical career
in Schlumberger will lead in and out of technical, management and support
roles, broadening experience, providing a unique variety and building the
strongest corporate management potential of tomorrow.
And while we are looking for the potential in our recruits to benefit from this
philosophy, we do not compromise on engineering expertise. Which is why
we are market leaders in our four mainstream activities and are continuing to
invest in R&D with a commitment and confidence way beyond that of our
competitors.
If you would like to know more about these careers which range from
industrial engineering in some of the most high-tech plants in the world,
to field-based jobs supplying specialised technical services to our oilfield
clients all over the world, please consult your careers department or contact
