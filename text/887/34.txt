IPear Sir

Dear Chris,
It is surprising asking around College
how few undergraduates at Imperial seem
to have applied for any electricity shares.
Here are three reasons I have heard from
three different people.
i) I couldn't be bothered.
ii) I don't beleive the Government should
sell off the industry. I a m against the
principle.
iii) I don't want to risk any of m y savings.
To which I answered:
i) Y o u could be bothered to work 60 hour
weeks during the summer cleaning toilets
at £2.92 an hour so w h y not fill in this
form, attach a £1,200 cheque and wait for
an early xmas gift of at least £ 1 5 0 and all
for 15 minutes work.
ii) I a m against the principle, however the
sell-off will go ahead regardless, besides
surely a more important principle is that
by applying for shares you will deny M r
Loadsamoney in Chelsea of shares.
iii) A n y investment in shares involves
risk, however if you study the accounts of
the RECs (Regional Electricity Companies)
and the multitude of circumstances
behind this floatation (City Institutions
with high liquidity 'problems' etc etc) you
soon begin to realise it is riskier leaving
your money i n a building society. The
only way you will lose money is if W o r l d
War Three breaks out one minute into
official dealings i n the shares (in which
case there would be no point having
money anyway) or if you apply for too
many shares in each R E C (in which case
you might lose more interest in your
money than capital gains from the shares
you obtain because of anticipated heavy
'scaling down').
Let's be realistic by splitting £1,200 into
£100 applications in each R E C it will be
virtually impossible to lose in the short
term even after dealing costs. Even
students with no savings could have
made money b y getting a student loan,
applying for shares with the money,
selling the shares straightaway and then
repaying the loan early. For a College
with such a right-wing reputation it is
surprising how how unenterprising many
of its students seem to be.
This was a golden opportunity to make
money, golden opportunities do not grow '
on trees.
Yours sincerely,
Mark Whiting, Physics 3.

Dear Sir,
A r e there a n y pros to religion? I don't
think so. Just an awful lot of cons.
It was sad to observe in last week's
article o n religion, the complete
misunderstanding about what true
Christianity is all about. I have to say
'true' Christianity has nothing to do with
Hinduism, Islam, or Buddhism. It also has
nothing to do with Roman Catholicism or
what the majority of the Church of
England churches are telling us.
So, w h y is true Christianity any
different? Well, it is not religion.
Everyone is telling us that w e must try
LETTERS
our best to please God and then w e will
be getting somewhere with him; check
out all the religions o n offer. Only true
Christianity is saying something especially
different. In fact, it is saying that you
can't please G o d , it stands alone.
Religion is summed up b y the words:
ceremony, display and formalism. It
changes the outwards appearance,
maybe, but peoples' hearts are still the
same. Mankind is inherently bad, or
sinful. Y o u don't accept that? W a k e up.
Take a look around. Religions are trying
to deal with this problem at the 'effect'
end of things instead of at the 'cause'
end. No wonder religion is hypocritical.
True Christianity is not about rules and
ceremonies dealing with effects. It is
about supernatural power to deal with
the cause—man's inherent sinfulness. It is
about what god thinks, written in the
Bible. It is about God, who is angry with
sin because he is a God of justice. It's
about the reality that everyone has
broken God's L a w . Everyone has sinned.
It's about being regenerated—or born
again—by G o d and having G o d living i n
you. Many people in this College will
testify to this. It's their o w n experience.
Lives are transformed. Y o u get right with
God not by things you do, but by what
God has done for you. This is where true
Christianity stands alone. 'Doing good'
has to be preceeded by being 'born
again'. The cause must be dealt with
before the effects.
This letter is one of information. N o w
that you have the information you can
decide o n it. Choose to ignore it or
accept it.
Therefore, as God says, Choose Life.
