African Head
Charge Songs of Praise LP
African Head Charge is the product of O n
U-Sound maestro Adrian Sherwood's
efforts to bring his own distinctive sound
to traditional African percussion and
reggae (of sorts). A s such this is a
vigorously odd record, mixing deep dub
rhythms with bizarre electro effects and
the odd haze guitar, which in most tracks
on this album combine to form an
indescribable mantra. John Peel has been
giving this a spin of late.
Words fail me. This is a fascinating
album.

10,000 Maniacs
Town and Country Club 26.11.90
This was 10,000 Maniacs' second visit to
the T & C , m a r k i n g the release of a
collection of early material, Hope Chest.
The Maniacs' support was provided by
John Lombardo, a one-time Maniacs
bassist, and M a r y Ramsey, an Irish singer-
songwriter, w h o is a long-term friend of
the Maniacs. T h e y played a number of
similar-sounding Irish folk songs, which
signalled retirement to the bar for most
of the audience. However, on joining the
Maniacs tor the main set, they showed
their true (excellent) instrumental and
vocal skill.
The Maniacs' set opened with an old
1950s promo film for Jamestown, N Y S ,
the band's home. This is in deference to
Natalie Merchant's (the lead singer) views
on community power and alternative
politics. It was, however, sufficient to
confuse the R£M-lookalikes in the
audience.
Resisting constant calls from the
audience for favourite songs, Marchant &.
Co launched into some old material from
Hope Chest. This was an enjoyable blend
of Reggae, Jazz and Rock. However, a
fight at the front early in the set had
visibly shaken Merchant, w h o seemed to
want to be somewhere else.
However, m o v i n g to the compassion
{City of Angels) and militancy (What's the
Matter here?) of the i?£M-influenced In
My Tribe and Blind Man's Zoo, Merchant
lifted her performance—talking to the
audience, and inserting unplanned songs
like Ferry's Dance Away to the
bewilderment of the rest of the band.
Merchant, like her boyfriend Michael
(REM) Stripe, appropriates m a n y 60s
influences for use on stage. Her stage
presence is enhanced by her circling
dance, thrashing about her flowing dress
and long, dark hair. The rest of the band
temper her wild abandon with a solid
background, making for an electrifying,

& The Buffalo Club
Temptation LP
According to the press release for this
record, 'Robert Reilly is already writing
with maturity, performing with dynamism
and creating his o w n unique brand of
Rock/Blues' Unfortunately these are
words guaranteed to enshrine M r . Reilly
in Q-magazine land. A s far as this writer
is concerned, 'maturity' = 'ploddingly
unoriginal', 'dynamism' = 'turgidity' and
'unique brand of R o c k / B l u e s ' = 'the
dullest parts of Rock and the most boring
parts of Blues'. The man responsible for
mixing this record is also responsible for
Sade and Everything But The Girl. Cure
fans spotting the near-miss title Praying
For Rain will be disappointed. Wet Wet
Wet fans spotting the title Temptation
probably won't be. If anybody wants this
record please drop a line in to Felix
before I destroy it.

intense performance, albeit somewhat
short at 1% hours, but this, I suspect, was
more to do with the early curfew at the
T & C than Merchant's ability to continue.
