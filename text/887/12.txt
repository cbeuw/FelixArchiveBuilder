FELIX braves the Beers Steers and Queers in a daring encounter with.
m « W*% 1 # 1 FELIX interviews...
The Revolting C O C K S Swervedriver
If y o u walk into a hotel bar, full of rejects
from the set of Spinal Tap a n d shout
'Okay w h o are the Revolting Cocks then?'
you expect an unusual response. Mine
was; 'Yep that's us'.
They sat me d o w n and introduced
themselves: A l i e n called A l wore a
cowboy hat, shades a n d h a d three days
stubble over his entire head; Chris was
Levi-clad with straggly hair looking like
he had spent most of his life glue sniffing
and Paul Raven bassist of Killing Joke
adding some weight to the interview, as if
to prove the Revolting Cocks had to be
taken seriously.
The Revolting Cocks, have a bad
reputation; banned on Radio and T V a n d
not allowed to play gigs in this country,
after a campaign against them b y
Conservative M P Teddy Taylor. A s well
as this, members of the band have been
arrested for male prostitution a n d charges
of bestiality o n stage. The Revolting
Cocks have come to clear their name.
They set about this immediately:
A l : It's a pack of fucking lies everything
you've read...
Me: I haven't read anything honest!
Paul: Well, it's all true then.
Chris: Yeah, let's make up some n e w
ones.
A l : What w e do on stage is very strange,
five or six of us go on, with our backing
tapes and play instruments! This happens
still! I don't wear leather pants or scream
into an echo plex w e don't d o that...
Me: So where has the hype come from?
A l : I don't k n o w , I'd like to find the
bastard that did a n d beat the crap out of
him, or give h i m 50 quid, I don't k n o w
which. I mean, as far as the guitar player
getting arrested, that's true, the herd of
cattle, the electric fence, n o that's not
true, w h o w o u l d have an electric fence
on stage? It's nothing but lawsuits for the
rest of your life.
Paul: W h y not razor wire or flame
throwers?
A l : Here's what I think happened. W e
have a lot of girls w h o want to dance
with us on stage everywhere w e go, w e
don't care, race, colour, creed, whatever
as long as they don't touch our deli or
drink our beer, fuck that's great. In
Houston we had a bunch of girls none of
them under 20 stone. T h e n someone
comes backstage and shouts 'There's a
bunch of cows on stage!' a n d by the time
it gets back to the English press, I've
ridden a mechanical bull on stage, fucked
one of them, used a cattle prod on the
rest. I mean, this is just what happens.
Chris: Yeah we're a bunch of fucking
choir boys.
A l : Right we're nice lads, we're from
Basildon really.
Me: What's your version of the guitar
player being arrested then?
A l : I mean there's a lot of grains of truth
in these stories, he was pissed out of his
brain and wandering a section of Houston
k n o w n for male prostitution, cause that
was where the club was at a n d Marc was
out drunk and tried to flag d o w n a taxi,
only it was a police car and as it passed
he got mad, 'cause he thought it was a
taxi, picked up a rock a n d threw it. A s
they saw he was wearing a 'Beer Steers
and Queers' t-shirt (their latest album)
thought he was a prostitute so they
arrested him, in the process found two
sleeping pills on him because the poor
bastard can't sleep on a tour bus all the
rocking and shaking, and that gets blown
out of proportion, so he w a s giving blow
jobs in an alley with five hits of L S D o n
him, what gets me was he w a s in a cell
with a child molester facing six months
and Marc could have been up for 8-10
years, he did get off o n a l l charges, which
is good.
Ministry w e got booked into a hotel
under the pretense w e were a religious
sect in Denver Colorado for four days.
A l : Five days.
Chris: Best fucking five days of m y life.
A l : Year of course w e poured soap suds
in the pool, set off all the alarms, all the
basic shit.
Chris: These people were tripping their
brains out!
A l : This was the first time the band a n d
the actual bus driver went wacko. W e
had two bus drivers; a husband a n d wife
team. He pulled a 45 on her, w e were'all
tripping so w e got our cameras and
started shooting, while the police and the
squad team came in he was o n the 6th
floor trying to throw his wife off, he'd
drawn both buses up to the entry, it was
like a semicircle so there was no w a y in
or out, and h a d thrown a l l the luggage
out and cut the fuel lines so there was
Me: that's fair enough. O K , h o w was the
Sunday Sport party?
Chris: It was really great, it was the best
party I have ever been to, there was two
kinds of people there, bimbos with
massive tits a n d lecherous o l d men, and
me, I got m y photo like w i t h two babes
sittin' on m y knee with their tits hangin'
out, great m a n .
A l : W h e n we got back there was a
Spanish maid cleaning our rooms, so I
used all m y Spanish on her which is drop
everything and let's fuck! She left fast...!
Me: D o y o u ever get banned or thrown
out of places?
A l : No No, w e get out of places like this,
this is a rock flea bag more bands per
capita, y o u k n o w after you've seen Iggy
Pop passed out in an elevator throwing
up on himself, once you've seen one
pukeathon you've seen them all.
Chris: W h e n we were touring with
fuel everywhere, this happened during
happy hour so w e were a l l in the bar
tripping and rooting for h i m with
Japanese tourists taking pictures of the
whole thing.
Chris: He'd like taken a bunch of crystal
methadryne then hallucinogens and half a
bottle of segrams, he was out of his
fuckin' head, he drank a bottle of whisky
at seven in the morning.
A l : He just lost it, he just had a bad
day...just a bit!
Chris: It was just the ministry tour.
A l : That was the time Martin got accused
of rape.
Chris: That's right.
Paul: This is obviously a well kept secret.
A l : A s k him 'Ask him'.
Paul: Should go down well at the right
dinner party!
A l : Here's the rub man. This is Martin
Atkins of Public Image, Killing Joke. First
night in Denver, and some roadie asks a
girl back to the hotel, and they're sitting
in the bar drinking and her boyfriend
walks in and says—I w a n n a talk to you,
what are y o u doing with these heathen
scum, she goes out—says 'They
kidnapped me a n d tried to rape me'—and
fingured Martin, he's the high profile
band member, he drags her up to this
party on the sixth floor and goes round
saying 'Where's Martin, I w a n n a find
Martin', I say what for—rape—so I k n e w
it was a crock of shit cause Martin's, y o u
know...so I grab the guy a n d her in the
elevator, it's kinda like blackmail, and
said 'now say it isn't true' and it wasn't,
she says it was so I hit T ' a n d keep
hitting the guy 'til w e hit the first floor
and the doors open, a n d it was a glass
elevator so everyone was cheering me on
in the lobby, a n d she says 'it was true, it
was true, so I hit '6' and w e goy sent
back up. After the 3rd trip d o w n a n d he's
got blood pouring everywhere, she goes 'I
lied, I lied', so I let them both go, a n d
they went off to the police and they
didn't go after me or Martin but John our
tour manager, so the squad team descend
on John's r o o m right a n d break d o w n the
door and John is in b e d with another girl
whose more than willing and able so he
obviously didn't rape her a n d the police
are going 'he doesn't look like a rapist to
me' a n d the girl has sheets around her
neck going 'what's the problem officers?'
so he got off. H e had to go a n d see them
in the morning. Not that I'm like
advertising what w e do just take it or
leave it. That's what w e are, m a n .
Chris: A t least we're not banned here.
Me: Y o u are.
A l : what's this man?
Me: You're banned, they can't play you're
record on T V or radio.
Chris: But they just did an interview with
me, they can't do that and not play the
music, a n d I say fuck every other fuckin'
word.
Me: They'll just block it out.
A l : That's what w e mean man, let them
ban us w e don't care, w e just want to
make records, w e don't even want
success, if w e had money we'd just build
a studio. I mean Teddy Taylor wants us
out of here, but Chris last night caught
him sucking some girls titties, at the Sport
party w e have photographs, so he's
gonna lay off us.
Chris: A n d we're gonna make a lot of
money!
A l : This is a scoop for y o u , a world
premier, a couple of thousand students
are gonna be the first to k n o w about
Teddy Taylor. So we're gonna come here
in January a n d walk up to immigration
and say w e are the Revolting Cocks w e
would like entry to your fine empire and
if they say no, then we'll start some
shit...hey y o u don't k n o w where I can get
some cattle by any chance...
Close to midnight, backstage at the
Camden Palace. Swervedriver are due on
stage soon. Introduced b y their manager
Richard, A d a m , the lead singer and
guitarist, a n d the drummer, Graham,
seem relaxed and ready to take on the
world. Of the other two members of the
band, Jim, the guitarist is sitting with a
group of friends and Eddie, the bass
guitarist, is around somewhere!
Swervedriver have only really been a
band for eighteen months, but have
k n o w n each other for much longer.
A d a m , J i m and Eddie originally being in
a band called Shake Appeal. Graham was
in his first band at 12 years old, at least,
one with real instruments. 'Before that,
the bands I was in played cricket bats!'
Having just finished a tour of Scotland,
A d a m described it as 'Alright, but
knackering, I'm pleased it's over!'. T h e y
are currently o n tour in the U K until
December 15. Whilst travelling to one
gig, Graham reveals, his boots were
knocked off the lorry!
Signed under Creation Records,
Swervedriver have released two records
to date, Son of Mustang Ford, their first
single with which they d i d a U K tour a n d
a four track E P , Ravedown, recorded in
June-July of this year. In six weeks they
will be back in the studio recording their
album, and are then off to Holland.
A l l of their tracks have been written by
A d a m , although he admits they usually
come from a jamming session with the
band. W h e n asked how they would
describe their music, having explained
that it has been described as hardcore-ish,
A d a m replied 'Well, I'd prefer to say it
was melodical!'.
Listing their influences as 'rock in
general', they were asked which gigs they
went to see. 'Anything with a good guitar
sound, feedback' replied Graham. 'We've
seen Killing Joke, Pixies'. 'We've seen
Captain Beefheart and Miss White Pope',
added A d a m .
Describing being compared to Dinosaur
Jr. as 'fair enough'. They were asked
what they thought of the Manchester
scene.
'Well, I suppose Fools Gold was alright'
replied A d a m 'but the rest is shit, and
you can quote that!'.
Out on stage, Swervedriver, themselves
were definitely not shit, giving an
awesome performance leaving many
suitably impressed.
Returning backstage they were
extremely modest about their
performance, w i t h Eddie describing it as
'Not as good as it could have been'.
Having rated their performance as 4/10,
they rated their enjoyment of the gig
9/10. 'If y o u don't enjoy anything y o u do
then it's definitely not w o r t h doing',
stated Jim.
A d a m had referred to the bands name
to 'being out of control'. Swervedriver are
far from being out of control, a n d should
be heading straight for the top.
DJ.
Rave Down EP
This album is not for baggies, but they're
welcome to b u y it into the charts . In
fact, Swervedriver are more of a
Dinosaur Jnr meets My Bloody Valentine.
The result is a relaxing medley of roughly
produced guitar and extrovert harmonies
which melt delectably under the drawling
vocals.
It's still something that Ride do a lot
better, but if y o u go for that raw, fuzzy
sound, then these guys will be an instant
hit.
