Dear FELIX,
Why For A r t Thou
I would be grateful if y o u could pass
my comments on the above article
appeased on the last F E L I X , to Athena,
the author.
There was a surprising ommission of
Buddhism in the article above which
discusses the pros and cons of religion.
Probably, the author may not be having
sufficient knowledge of the philosophy of
Buddhism. To be frank, I k n o w only very
little of Buddhist philosophy which takes
several years of full time study for a
layman to understand. But, I would be
able to address some of the points
discussed in the article from the Buddhist
point of view.
1. A s far as women's rights are
concerned, ordination of w o m e n was
accepted in Buddhism around 600 B C by
Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism,
himself. Since then, ordination of w o m e n
was part of the Buddhist society. T h e first
w o m a n Prime Minister in the world is
from Sri Lanka, a society dominated by
the Buddhist culture.
2. O n how liberal Buddhist philosophy
is: I would like to quote directly his
words.
'Do not accept anything by mere
tradition.
Do not accept anything because it
appears in Scriptures.
Do not accept anything because it is
taught by the respected.'
'As the wise test gold by burning, cutting
and rubbing it, so are you to accept m y
words after examining and not merely
out of regard to me.'
(Gautama the Buddha)
3. Out right rejection of cast system:
' A person becomes a B r a h m i n (higher
cast) or a Havijam (low cast) not by his
origin but by his deeds.'
(The Gautama the Buddha)
'He was from a higher cast family, in fact
a prince.'
4. O n compassion:
'Go fourth for the good of the many
For the happiness of the many
Out of compassion for the world.'
'Hatred never ceases by hatred but by
love.'
(Gautama the Buddha)
5. O n intolerance of violence:
In Buddhism, harming any living being
for any reason, is not tolerated unlike
some other religions where animals lives
are sacrificed for God.
6. Buddhists are supposed to believe in
themselves, not on an all powerful God.
A person, himself is responsible for what
he/she does, but nobody else.
Hope these points would be useful to you
in the future.
With kind regards,
Priyantha.
Dear Chris,
Subject: Rejoinder to 'Michael Newman
on the right to be blasphemous'
What struck me about the article under
reference is the admission of some
assertions by individuals the author has
evident regard for as incontrovertible
evidence of truth. Unfortunately, the law
of evidence is made of sterner stuff. Dr
Jacob Bronowski is free to hold personal
opinions but his being a scientist and
humanist does not confer 'papal
infallibility' on his utterances not even the
title of Dr or Prof can do that except if
the author will want the reading public to
accept Dr Bronowski's utterance as a
'revelation'!
To further underscore the significance
of this point. Think of it, how many self-
respecting academics will today regard
themselves as Freudian Psychologists? But
Freudian Psychology was once the thing.
Can you iamgine the damage done to
society as a result of this naive attitude of
acceptive and bandying about the
utterances of individuals w h o prat
themselves about as scientists, as
scientific truth? M y advice for the author
is to carry out a thorough study into the
differences between value judgements "
and scientific facts on the one hand, and
facts and truth on the other.
Finally, may he by these sayings be
admonished: Beyond reason there is
intuition and beyond intuition there is

Dear FELIX,
I was stirred to reply to Michael
Newman's 'Blasphemy' article of
November 30. His initial thoughts on
blasphemy were sensible but he seemed
to go on to say all religion was inhuman,
cruel and thorougly evil. I would like to
contest his argument, using the example
of m y o w n faith, Christianity, which is the
only one I am qualified to defend.
To start with Mr Newman omits all the
tremendous things that Christianity has
contributed to the world. I won't bother
to start to name them here.
Secondly, he fails to make a distinction
between what Christianity teaches and
what people do in its name. One might
consider the violence of the French
revolution in the name of freedom and
equal rights, the Nazi scientists
experimenting in the name of science. Do i
we rid the world of freedom or science,
therefore.' I could point out the
monstrous evils of regimes having an

Dear Chris,
As the annual 'Christmas' sales drive
becomes more and more like a religious
festival, I'd like to offer the following
prayer:
Lord,
We thank you for our free trade, and
for the prosperity and Christmas presents
this brings. A t this time we pray for those
less fortunate than ourselves—those that
suffer in countries without financial
tolerance.
We pray for those that w o r k hard to
provide for their families, but still have
most of their earnings stolen by the
'state'. W e pray for those that have to
suffer the effects of poverty traps due to
social security measures.
At this time we pray particularly for
those willing and able to earn money, but
are prevented from working by the greed
of those with jobs, by their artificially
high wages due to collective bargaining
and m i n i m u m wage laws.
So we ask, Lord, that y o u will free the
paths to great prosperity, not just for
those with a comfortable if restricted
quality of life, but particularly those in
the most need of the freedom to work to
better their lives.
In the name of the Father, the Son and
the Spirit of Enterprise, A m e n .

absence of religion—Stalin, Pol Pot, most
Eastern Bloc countries, China...should we
rid the world of atheism?
Thirdly, Mr N e w m a n describes religion
as unempirical and unreasonable.
Christianity can be corroborated by the
wealth of evidence of the ressurection
and by the tangible and physical acts of
God in the lives of those w h o love him.
What else does he want?
Lastly, it appeared that a focus for
Michael Newman's anti-religious ideas is
the heart felt grief of a man whose family
were murdered at Auchswitz. It seems to
me that Auchswitz was the result of
man's decision to drop the God of love
and this teaching to love, and man's
decision to do whatever he wants,
whenever he feels like it.
I would be most interested to continue
this discussion with Michael N e w m a n
should he wish to do so.
Yours,
Jez Spearman, Civ Eng MSc.
