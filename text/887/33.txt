Dear FELIX,
I a m writing with regard to A l a n
Bailey's letter published in your issue of
Friday 16 November.
I was glad to note from the response to
the above-mentioned letter that 1 wasn't
the only person alarmed b y the
nationalistic a n d racialistic questions in
contained. However, none of the replies
fully captured m y personal feelings
towards it.
Almost every country in this world has
a period or aspect of its past of w h i c h it
cannot be proud. Japan is one such
example. Britain is another.
What is important however, is the
manner in w h i c h a nation emerges from
these dark periods of its history and what
it learns from them.
The Japanese have reconstructed a
cultured and humane society of which it
may be proud. Japan's defence budget
only takes up 1% of its gross domestic
product—just imagine the vast resources
which would be freed if other
industrialised nations followed this lead.
In addition to this, perhaps in
acknowledgement of its w a r guilt, Japan
has become the largest single aid donor
nation in the world.
The attraction of aid to developing
countries is that it is free of the 'political
strings' attached by other western
nations.
If it is these achievements that Prince
Charles was paying tribute to at Emperor
Hirohito's enthronement, then so be it—
they deserve wider recognition.
The Prince's support for important and
relevant causes is most impressive.
Instead of beating the blind patriotic
drum which w o u l d please Bailey even so
much, he focuses attention on the real
inadequacies of his nation—thereby
making a concrete contribution to the
society he lives in. Indeed, if it is true
that for a nation to improve itself it must
acknowledge its o w n faults, it explains
why Japan is where it is today (and
unfortunately whre Britain is as well).
In Charles' support for saving the
tropical rainforest he has his weight
behind an issue of far greater importance
to mankind than honouring the w a r dead
who—it must be remembered—may never
be brought back to life again. T o argue
otherwise, shows an ignorance of the real
dangers facing us today. A n d it is not b y
saying how 'gloriously' o u r boys w o n the
war that these problems will go away.

Dear Chris,
I would like to take this opportunity to
wish A l a n Bailey a very merry Christmas.
Unfortunately Bailey will probably not
appreciate this as Christ (Son of God—a
God accepted by the majority of this
planet's population, not just b y Bailey a n d
several other right w i n g xenophobic
bigots—have y o u looked them up yet?)
had two major 'faults' according to
Bailey's w a y of reckoning. Firstly the Son
of God was Jewish i.e. not English so
probably not a Tory. Secondly H e was
poor, so again probably w o u l d not have
been too enamoured with Thatch. (Before
anyone criticises m y use of past tense I
Sorry Bailey.
I do, however, have an honest w o r d of
advice for Bailey. I urge h i m to travel a
bit around the w o r l d and see how other
people live and think. This will: (a) enable
him to put Britain, or his perceptions of
Britain, in a proper perspective. That
includes appreciating, both its role as an
imperialistic aggressor and, its
contribution to the intellectual and
technological development of man. (b) Let
him see what makes up a nation a n d a
people—and h o w different that can be
from the ambitions of a handful of
politicians w h o claim to act i n its interest.
It is the failure of these politicians
which w e acknowledge every
remembrance day—the war dead being
their victims.

am using an historic perspective—look it
up Alan.)
Over and above this, Christmas is 'The
season of good will to all m e n ' — A L L M E N
black, white, yellow, pink, green, straight,
gay, Christian, Moslem, Buddhist, Hindu,
Shinto, agnostic, atheist, a n d yes even
A l a n Bailey.
So happy Christmas Alan, I wish y o u no
harm (you seem to be good enough at
that yourself) but do try to engage your
obviously faulty brain before y o u spout
off any more xenophobic (still not looked
it up?) crap.
Yours,
Larry O'Brien.
