Manager's Bit e
Harassment seems to be on the
increase. I have heard of another case at
University College. A l l this term a w o m e n
has been followed and verbally harassed.
To find out what she is doing he listens
to her friends a n d slags her d o w n in front
of them. He threatens suicide and
confronts numerous people at a time.
If all that wasn't enough the trained
sabbatical concerned with that kind of
problem doesn't seem to care. W h e n
approached he said that ' Y o u are just
being sensationalist' and that he wasn't
going to do anything because she didn't
approach him during office hours. Since
when does a sabbatical's job finish dead
on 5 o'clock o r 5.30pm? Especially when
such a situation arises.
The victim has received no guidance as
to what steps to take, not even to the
extent of calling Nightline for general
advice. It seems ridiculous that such a
thing can happen.
The cuts are biting hard at home' and
away. The Careers Advisory Service is
under very serious threat of closure and
so are departments at Q M W . 1 wonder
who and what will be next, and will
anybody do anything about it? I hope so!.
I k n o w that quite a few people around IC
are concerned about their future.
That said a n d done it's time to go and
so have a good one, Turkey.

Letter from Cardiff
Dear Chris,
Re: Issue 884 "IC Rag in Dispute".
Further to o u r telephone conversations
of the 26th November concerning your
intentions to print a detailed article as a
follow up to the above piece, w e would
like to clarify the following points:
1. A t no time has Rag Caerdydd or any
members of its committee made
allegations of theft or dishonesty amongst
the Executive of IC or IC Rag. W e believe
that all the money raised on the day was
passed on to Mencap. Such
sensationalisms only serve to do harm to
the Rag accused and Rags nationally.
Should any press outside the college press
follow up your article in issue 884, IC
Rag's reputation will be seriously tainted,
and in such cases everybody loses,
especially the charities benefitting from
the good w o r k IC R a g does.
2. T h e letter sent by ourselves to one
of your reporters, at his request, as a
result of an incident w h i c h happened at
IC, expressed only a chronological
account of this and other related incidents
which have happened at IC for
background information. It was marked
personal to the reporter in question since
he had offered his personal promise of
confidentiality. This was immediately
breached and the letter forwarded to IC
Rag apparently in the capacity of R a g
Caerdydd. This has resulted in
correspondance from IC R a g to the
reporter, a copy of which he forwarded
to ourselves. These two breaches of
confidential mail serve no purpose other
STATEMENT
than inflaming an already tense situation,
with the t w o Rags were trying to resolve.
Our R a g Chair is still awaiting a full
apology from IC Rag for the foolish
behaviour that occurred o n the 3rd
November, w h i c h resulted in severe
trauma and discomfort to her o n the
night and for the following week. W e also
feel that an admission of wrongful
practice on the part of the reporter and
an unreserved apology for the breach of
confidence to both Cardiff and Imperial
College Rags be printed in "Felix".
Beyond that w e feel the place for
resolving the rest of the disagreements is
in private and not through the media.
Rag Caerdydd Committee.
The Manager and the Chairman of IC Rag in no w a y agree that the allegations made in the above letter about the reporter have
any foundation. H e did not commit any breach of confidence and is not guilty of any wrongful practice.
