Candidates for the post of President were in-
vited to submit manifestos not exceeding 600
words to "Felix" by a notice placed by the nomi-
nations Hist in the Union Lower Lounge.
We have received manifestos from four of the
candidates, and they are reproduced here: Pete
Gillett failed to deliver one to the Felix office by
the prescribed time.

I.C. water polo team had their first outing of the
season on Tuesday 14th and Thursday 16th Nov. in
the U.L. inter-college's tournament. They repeated their
successes of the past two years in winning the competi-
tion by beating Barts Hospital 9—5 in thefinaldespite
giving them 4 goals start in the handicap. Two new-
comers to the team this year, Paul Hindle and Andy
Smith showed up well in this match, and in, the semi-
final against St. Thomas's getting three goals apiece
in the tournament.
The second team were narrowly defeated by Barts
In the quarter-finals by 5-3, showing promise for the
future since most of our players had very little experi-
ence. However we will welcome any new members to
the club and anyone wishing to join should come along
to our practices on Mondays and Fridays at 7.00 p.m.
at the swimming pool.
lywinks
On Tuesday, November 14, U.C. fought their way
through swamps, dark forests, foreboding mountains
and The Underground to Southside, there to squidge-
off against the Nottingham Forest of the Winks World
—I.C.H! They arrived expecting to slaughter us, but
little did Ithey realize the previously latent winking
ability of I.C. winkers. We ended the first round only
I point behind, but this was soon rectified. As I.C.
gathered momentum, we began to regain our form
and lose by a greater margin. Last year's disastrous
defeat of 1-111 was reduced to 49-63, through baffling
the opposition by not knowing what we were doing.
In one game in the last round, we thrashed 7-0 the
Yank and the sweetie Who wanted to play with red
and yellow winks "because they're such pretty colours."
This was achieved by brilliant potting out in two goes,
a tactic motivated either by the desire to show them
what we are made of'(!) or the thirst of our Charlady—
oops, Chairlady, who was promptly seen to disappear
Into the bar.
I.C. won the last round convincingly and with dissent
in the ranks, U.C. left, poor shadows of their former
selves. We challenge ithem to play us again, if ithey dare.
Roll up, roll up, get your ego-trip here: Team: Helen
Isaac, Bill Collett; Bob Douglas, Chris Cartledge; Mike
Ixer, Glyn Jones; John James and Mark S. Omebody.

I believe Imperial College
Union as it is, cannot last
much longer. The days of
the extremist are fast dying
and with it I.C.U.
Student Unions at present
are quite a Strong force; but
this force is not being direc-
ted properly. The power of
the iStudent Unions should
be used Wholly for the bene-
fit of the students (is not
this why they were formed?)
and noit to Harass everyone
else.
At present I.C.U. is a poli-
tical union; although it is not
the job of Ithe Union Execu-
tive to handle political and
external affairs, 'they repeat-
edly appear [to be doing so.
Why then do we have an Ex-
ternal Affairs Committee?
The answer is: so 'that it can
take the brunt of the load of
external affairs from the
President and to advise him
only on matters relevant
directly to I.C.U.
The President of I.C.U.
should toe non-political him-
self, yet toe 'able to'under-
stand the views of everyone
else and from them decide
which is the best action in
the particular case involved.
Accommodation at the col-
lege should toe improved. At
present a new hall is atoout
to be built at Northside; this
is a Step in ithe right direc-
tion but with the price of
flats 'and digs ever increas-
ing, more space is needed
immediately; the houses on
Exhibition Road ibacklng on
the Prince's 'Gardens should
be acquired whatever the
cost and either pulled down
in order to build a new
hall on the site lor converted
to Student Houses. Apart
from new buildings, some of
the older residences should
be renovated; the work on
Student Houses is slow and
when did Beit Hall last have
an interior face lift?
Social life should be the
main concern of the Union
but it seems sadly neglected
by the Executive. True the
Deputy President runs the
Union Building but who was
the last President to take an
interest in Rag while he was
in office. Perhaps the apath-
etic view of the Union is re-
flected toy the students; do
they have much interest in
Rag? . . . I don't even think
the Rag Committee has.

Last year thousands of stu-
dents were involved in mili-
tant actions against (the pro-
posals of (the Tory govern-
ment to weaken student
unions. They won wide sup-
port land eventually succeed-
ed in forcing ithe temporary
shelving of the Thatcher pro-
posals.
If I.'C. Union were typical,
the Tories need not have
bothered. Martin Black and
the present leading figures
in the CCU's are quite cap-
ably rendering the union im-
potent without any help
from Ted Heath.
Of course, the reason the
Union is so feeble is that it
never takes any decision to
fight for better conditions.
Why? Because it never even
discusses them. Anything in
the least bit controversial is
labelled "political" and swept
under ithe carpet. This saves
embarrassing anyone with a
soft Spot for the Conserva-
tive/Right-wing Tjafoour con-
sensus. Further, it leaves
bureaucrattcally minded offi-
cers, with plenty of time to
compile minutes, compile
agendas and concoct plots
for keeping Piers Coribyn off
NUS delegations all, of
course, life and death issues
for IC students.
Politically-Demanding Bit
The "anti-political" argu-
ment is however fundamen-
tally unsound. Issues like
grants, housing and auton-
omy will ibring us into con-
flict with the government,
the business interests who
back them land the press.
Thus Whey are immediately
and unavoidably political. To
suggest otherwise is word-
play.
Isn't it possible that a
President with a little verve
and a social interest in I.C.
could Waken the place up,
get more student participa-
tion in things for their en-
joyment and less istudent
action against everyone else.
Cut out Ithe minority sport
of running the Union, let
everyone run it; have a pres-
ident that wants everyone to
run it, a president that actu-
ally knows a few people, a
president you can communi-
cate with, a person with the
good of the student at heart.
I shall 'Strive (if and when
elected) to improve the lot
of the Student at I.C. The
only thing that I will fight
every government for is a
higher grant.
Yours Rightly and Leftily,
IAN FARNELL
(the man with the
course down the
middle)
Main Issues
The issues I believe this
union should fight on are:—
'Grants: (a) at least £100
on the grant now—to keep
up with rising prices; (lb)
Full gram for all students—
no dependence on parental
income; '(lc) No introduction
of loans instead of grants;
(d) Post-grads to get the
London allowance which un-
der-grads gelt.
Housing: (a) launch an all-
London campaign through
NUS to force the DES to pro-
vide land and money for
more h'aills and student hous-
es at the same fees; (b) to
attack the general problem
of London housing, which
affects students especially
acutely in the form of extor-
tionate rents for third-rate
rooms.
Autonomy: (a) Resist
Thatcher's proposals, if they
are re-introduced, by massive
student actions; (to) Remove
any union rules which give
College authorities any right
to 'interfere with our deci-
sions; (c) support colleges
Where attacks on union have
been made toy reactionary
principals or vice-chancellors.
Representation: What gains
have been made have been
neutralised by the real deci-
sion-making powers moving
to higher committees with
no students or because our
representatives haven't been
accountable to union meet-
ings. Representation would
also toe more important if
we had something to say! An
alternative policy for IC re-
search 'and teaching should
be proposed on the principle
that science should serve the
needs of the people and not
be distorted and misused
for profit.
Food: Mooney's catering is
a perennial problem with no
simple answer. It is also
getting worse because the
Government has decreed that
Mooney must make la profit!
Preconditions for improve-
ments are (i) subsidies for
refs; (ii) more grants for
students; (iii) more and bet-
ter-paid staff.
How to win? Success on
grants and union autonomy
campaigns requires a vigor-
ously led, nationwide cam-
paign through NUS. We
Should work to strengthen
NUS especially at London
region level. Support from
other sections who are being
attacked toy the government
especially the Trade Unions,
will be a Crucial factor which
must toe patiently built up.
The first essential is to
arouse the students of IC
around these demands. As a
sabbatical president, I believe
I can do this.
The main reason for stand-
ing again in these presiden-
tial elections is to fight to
change the currents of opini-
on in the union which
caused a re-election. Specific-
ally this means 'the absten-
tionist view. To do this those
issues most directly affecting
students lat the moment must
be analysed, the links be-
tween these shewn and also
the methods of effective ac-
tion that students can take.
The last election campaign
showed that these issues are
Grants, Housing, and Auton-
omy. The autonomy that the
student union has is of over-
riding importance since it
controls how effective any
action we take is on the
other issues.
Grants:—• two improve-
ments in the grants system
are urgently needed now.
One is a rise in the total
and ithe other a removal of
the dependence upon paren-
tal contributions. The pay
freeze 'that exists at the mo-
ment will toe the first argu-
ment (brought against these
changes. This only highlights
the clear perspective that
Students must have. It is
only united workers action
that is going to smash the
freeze and lit is only united
studeritiworker action that is
going to change the grant
situation. This means that
students must support any
workers' action directed
against the freeze and work
towards workers' support of
student action. Since we
cannot expect big business
to stop prices rising nor the
token handful of civil ser-
vants lit is imperative 'that
we take action ourselves
along with Other workers. In
college students can take
the initiative toy (boycotting
refectories if there are price
rises. We must toe clear
though that the workers in
the refectories do not suffer
in order to keep our prices
down. Neither workers nor
students must accept respon-
sibility for any increases.
There are groups working
outside of college to try and
do this and they must be
supported to make this prac-
tice general and therefore
effective.
Housing: Students are find-
ing the housing situation
affecting them in two main
ways. Those in hall find
themselves paying for the
cost of future buildings
(when these do come we
find them being built "on
the cheap"—we need just
look at Northside where
again it will be the students
that suffer). Those not in a
hall are paying excessively
high rents for poor 'accommo-
dation. At the moment nine
colleges in the country are
on 'rent 'strike'. This is an
essential first step and one
should toe organised here if
there is any increase. These
however must have a pers-
pective of broadening such
action outside the student
field.
To help those Students not
in hall ithe union must sup-
port groups, such as the
Netting Hill housing associa-
tion and tenants associations
that are working to change
the situation. These must be
supported because they
clearly ahow where the res-
ponsibility for the housing
situation lies and so are dir-
ecting their efforts in sup-
port of ithose With housing
difficulties and against Ithe
system and its laws.
The autonomy of the union
is needed for Students to or-
ganise these activities. At the
moment there are no speci-
fic government attacks but
this is no time for compla-
cency. At 'the moment col-
lege authorities are attacking
individual unions up and
down the (country. To defend
our autonomy we must both
defend these unions in
Struggle >and use what auton-
omy we have. It has already
been shown on the specific
issues of grants and housing
how our autonomy can best
be used. That is in united
action with the economic
power of the working class.
That means that in order to
be of any good to students
the union must take up a
class line in all struggles.
I would like to thank Felix
for (this chance to present
my Manifesto to the 'Students
of I.C.
My nlame is Bill 'Wood. My
policies and thoughts—which
I Will do my best to imple-
ment if I am elected—are
these:
(1) I shall not lead the
union members, they Will
lead me, and I Will do my
best to toe a representative to
you, on your ibehialf.
(2) The cliquishness of the
exec, shalltoetoirlokendown
to an acceptable level. Alt Ithe
moment, the top end of 'the
union is entombed in a rigid
case, a situation which is
obviously harmful and bad
for those thousands outside
the clan.
(3) CJC.U.S might try to
restrict their roles (to being
entertainment facilities. At
the moment they are taking
matters, like that of the
event at 'Stirling University,
as their own concern, and'
taking damaging action on
these matters. This should
not really be part of
their job, and I will try to
discourage them thinking it
is.
(4) The C.C.Us also did
much harm to I.C.U. by sup-
porting very vigorously the
idea that to abstain in the
last presidential election
would toe fun. This was
really quite wriong, because
it swayed the voters into
abstaining rather than just
not vote, as ithey would
probably have done.
(5) 'The functioning of the
college and of union enter-
tainments will continue as
before—there is no reason (to
interfere. Various social and
academic sub-commiltitees,
amenities are doing good,
and need not ibe altered in
any way by union action.
(6) Now the usual argu-
ment that I.C.U. will not be
political in any way—con-
nected With N.U.S., yes—but
not political. I don't mind
political extremists airing
their views, but I object to
them using their power,
granted (to them for one rea-
son or another, to impress
these views.
(7) M y 'policies are not
rigid—far from it—they will
be altered if necessary by
general desire or demand. In
fact I hope that the union
will act for the 'students in
the way in which ALL of the
students want it to. That is
both postgrads and~ under-
grads, including of course
first years.
(8) I hope that this time
there will not be a terrific
wave of apathy in the voting,
and thai one of the candi-
dates gets the job. I sin-
cerely hope also that it is
the best man for the job,
for it is a post of very great
responsibility.
'(9) This is supposed to 'be
a manifesto, but if I may
have licence to say this to
the first years—you can win
the election, for there are
around 800 of you. If you
want (
a union president that
Will truly represent you, las
weill as Ithe rest of the col-
lege, ialher than just the
top end, then it is within
your power to have one.
Thank you.
(10) I have tried to toe
mercifully short and straight-
forward in this rendering but
if I haven't, I must apolo-
gise.
Felix has printed this word
for word, mistakes included,
so I must ask you to forgive
the toad gramimer and poor
spelling.
My thanks again to Felix.
