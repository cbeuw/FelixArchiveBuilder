Zebra in
Exhibition Road
NUS Conference Background
(continued from page 1.)
led by groups of unions
instead of individual ones.
The wrangling over these
takes many hours, and is
organised by a lovable
bunch of people called :
'Steering Committee." It's
quite normal for what was
originally tabled as an
amendment to come out
as the main > motion with
the original • motion as an
amendment... and if you
think that's confusing, well
you have to. see it in ac-
tion to believe it! It
comes as quite a surprise,
having been to one of
these compositing sessions
to believe that anything
can come of it all, let
Zebra crossings across Exhibition Road and Prince
Consort Road are to be introduced shortly. They will
be light-controlled.
These are part of a new
traffic plan for the junc-
tion of these roads which
is shown in the plan be-
low. As can be seen, the
right turn facility from
Prince Consort Road into
Exhibition Road is cur-
tailed also under this
scheme.
Martin Black. Hon.
Secretary of the Union,
told Council on Monday
that the Domestic Bursar
of the College, Carl Sea-
ford, considers it neces-
sary to additionally have
a central refuge for ped-
estrians in Prince Consort
Road directly opposite
the college gates there. In
a Idtter to the GLC Plan-
ning and Transportation
Department Mr. Seaford
said "In a peak ten-min-
ute period an average of
480 people an hour
crossed the road (i.e. one
every seven-and-a-half
seconds) during which
time 824 vehicles an hour
passed in both directions
(one every four and a half
seconds).
"The North and South
pavements are about 50
feet apart and it would,
therefore, take a pedes-
trian about 8 seconds to
cross at an unhurried
pace.
"At peak periods there
would always be one per-
son either in. the process
of crossing the road or
wishing • to cross. As the
vehicles in this road have
a tendency to appear at
fairly - regular intervals
rather than sporadically
a pedestrian cannot nor-
mally complete a cross-
ing without halting in the
middle of the road—this
does, of course, assume
that the east and west
flows are of the same or-
der (as they appear to be)
and this seems to suggest
that we should have a
central refuge to protect
pedestrians ait this other-
wise very dangerous posi-
tion on the road."
alone agreement on com-
mon interests and be-
liefs . . . but something
does.
Having got your com-
posited motion, and the
secretarial staff having run
off 1,000 copies of it
(that's how many people
there are at conference)
you can sit down, or rath-
er stand up, and discuss it.
The "discussions" are
rather like Union Gener-
al Meetings where every-
body is a (generally either
Communist or other ex-
treme left-wing faction)
lst-class bureaucrat and
super - constitutionalist
(they know their constitu-
tion and standing orders
upside down, in other
words). There are speeches
for speeches against,
speeches on, summings-up,
Chairman's rulings, Steer-
ing Committee's rulings,
votes by show of cards,
card votes, total and utter
confusion . . . . and out
of the end drops a beauti-
ful gift-wrapped piece of
"Policy" to be added to
the already n-inch thick
Policy Document, which
the NUS can rightly (?)
claim to be the represen-
tative view of the British
Student Body.
Since the NUS will be
claiming and exclaiming
throughout the press and
media generally that what
comes out of conference
is what YOU are thinking
and doing, you'd better be
made wiser as to what
DOES go on. So next week
I'll be completing the
background picture to
how conference works,
and the week after, con-
ference being over, we'll
be telling you what was
decided, and how IC dele-
gation voted on behalf of
of you.
By the way, if you
don't like the motions
that have been sent in on-
your behalf (none of them
will probably be discuss-
ed, by the way), you've
only yourselves to blame.
The Union Meeting to dis-
cuss them was inquorate.
Come on Thursday and
hear what the IC delega-
tion plans to do at Mar-
gate . . . if you don't tell
them how you think
they should vote, they
will use their initiative
and it's up to you wheth-
er you trust them.
ED. SAYS:
I've been wondering for quite some time why
people curse me for never being in my office when,
to the best of my knowledge, I'm in there quite a
lot of the time. It has, however, suddenly come to
light that these people have been trying to ring m y
office on internal 2881. Reason why you never get
an answer—it's not connected. I am making moves
to get the internal phone reconnected . . . until then,
you can ring the office on PO extension 2229 (or,
until they move the plethora of phones in the office,
also on extension 2133 or direct line 581 1243).
