Letters
to the Editor
V a n d a l i s m

Honoured Sir,—/ note with
interest a statement in your
worthy newspaper that an
outbreak of vandalism on
motor cars is to be
anticipated: whitewashing
and tyre deflation were men-
tioned. I further note the
appearance of a smalt notice
on <some windscreens indi-
cating that insurance against
such outrages may be ob-
tained.
As an owner of an old
car I would like to make the
following points. Whitewash-
ing of my vehicle's coach
painted bodywork is likely to
cause minute scratches
which will destroy the over-
ail protective effect of the
paint; the letting down of
tyres leads to tube damage
if the vehicle is allowed to
remain with its weight on de-
flated tyres. Both of these
activities would in any case
mean a gross inconvenience.
Making some discreet en-
quiries I discovered that the
rag is not unconnected with
the above scheme.
When I help charities with
money or services, I do so
freely, without persuasion;
furthermore I choose to
which charities I shall make
donations. The scheme
proposed is abhorrent to the
idea of generous and good
willed giving; however much
it may be treated as a joke,
there will remain, in the back
of people's minds, a threat.
The agencies to benefit from
rag would, I am sure, dis-
approve of this kind of as-
sistance.
I remain,
your humble servant,
JO SIAH LILLY WALL.
M i n e s a n d
R a g
Sir,—/ am writing to you
to draw to your attention the
appalling state of affairs that
exists in S.U.K. rag this
year. It has come to my
notice that I.C. is virtually
the only college that has
so far taken part in fund
raising "activities".
Also it is obvious that the
Royal School of Mines Union
efforts provide the mainstay
of I.C. rag (as always!).
Therefore I suggest that
S.U.K. rag is disbanded and
R.S.M. rag is substituted. In
this way running costs will
be less, and more money
will be available for the cha-
rities.
I think that Mr. Paul Hos-
kin could be persuaded to
take a course in "shaft
sinking" prior to his mar-
riage, and so become R.S.M.
rag chairman!
I apologise for the above
"crap" and wish S.U.K. rag
the best of luck during rag
week (especially Mines!).
I remain your
obedient "leftre",
A. T. W. PATRICK.
Pennies
from
Heaven
Sir,—It is to be welcomed
that there is such a large
range of modes of thought
and behaviour in a college
like this. It reflects the fact
that students come from all
manner of backgrounds and
regions.
This is, however, no ex-
cuse for the kind of public
behaviour exhibited by the
sort of person that I have in
mind; on the night of Nov-
ember 14 he was seen to be
"spending a penny" — as
one observer kindly put it—
from the balcony on the
south side of the Southside
block over the railings to the
street below.
Perhaps he and his friend
Tony (probably both live
somewhere in the bottom set
of Halls in Southside) might
consider that this action is
anti-social and disgusting.
Yours faithfully,
D.A.S.

Drumming up
Support
Sir, — Could it be that
the E nts publicity officer has
a prejudice against Japanese
drummers? Or perhaps with-
out the incentive of a £400
profit he finds it difficult to
arise in the mornings.
If any of your readers are
confused by the above para-
graph, perhaps we should be-
latedly advertise the fact
that Stomu Yamashita, the
Japanese drummer acclaim-
ed by those who have been
able to see and hear him to
be a Master of his art, play-
ed here last week.
If anyone has now been
confused by the second para-
graph, let me clarify the mat-
ter. The aforementioned
drummer undoubtedly played
here on Tuesday, but as far
as my knowledge of the mat-
ter goes there was not one
single scrap of advertising
anywhere in the college.
Agreed he's not a super-
star, but some people would
have been interested, had
they but known. A little
more effort would be ap-
preciated.
Peace and love,
A. C. MILLER
(gentleman)
