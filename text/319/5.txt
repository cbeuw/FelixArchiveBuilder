THE GREAT LAGER
RIP-OFF
During the last few years lager has become a
very popular drink with both sexes and even more
before you buy your next one, we suggest you
read this:
Have you seen the advert with the wild, barren,
Scandinavian terrain, the lissom blonde and the
rugged Mr. Sweden with his clear, sparkling pint
and satiated leer? "From Britain's Norseland" goes
the narrative, but do you know where Britain's
Norseland is? That enigma of rural splendour is
probably Wandsworth or Southwark or Burton-on-
Trent . . . .
One of the biggest
con. tricks pushed
through in recent years
has been the advent and
rapid expansion of the
UK draught lager indus-
try. Lagers with Scandi-
navian names like Carls-
berg and Skol are now
household names and
consumers, believing
that they are paying good
money for the privilege
of drinking strong, Con-
tinental brews, are the
victims of a gigantic rip-
off. What they are drink-
ing is very English and
is probably weaker than
the keg bitter stood next
to it — and that hasn't
got much to say for it-
self, either.
In the UK we have six
major brewing groups
who, in the past few
years have acquired
many smaller breweries
and now control the vast
majority of outlets.
These, besides each
marketing their own
prestige keg bitter, also
retail their own brand of
English lager:—
Allied B r e w e r i e s
(Double Diamond) brew
SKOL in the UK (Skol
International is part of
the Allied group).
Bass Charrington ('E')
brew Carling Black
Label.
Courage (Tavern) and
Scottish Newcastle (Tar-
tan) each retail Harp
lager, which is brewed
by Guinness.
Carlsberg is a famous
Danish brewery, but the
draught lager marketed
in the UK is brewed by
Watney Mann (Red).
The only true Conti-
nental draught lager
marketed in the UK is
Stella Artois. Stella is
here on a reciprocal
agreement between its
Belgian brewers and
Whitbread (Tankard)
who sell Trophy bitter in
Stella houses in Belgium.
Even so, Stella is un-
common over here com-
pared with Heineken,
brewed under licence by
Whitbread themselves.
Some smaller brewe-
ries also have their own
brand-name lagers.
But the story doesn't
end there. It's all very
well having consumers
who think that a weak
English beer is a strong
Continental lager. That
helps to sell it, yes, but
the breweries go further
than that. They make a
profit which in many
cases is approaching
200 per cent on cost
price. Not a bad return!
The college can buy
a keg of lager at a price
equivalent to about 11 p
a pint. (Fractionally
greater than, say, Tartan
at 10.5 pence). This
price is obviously above
cost, since the brewery
must take a profit from
it. Cost price could be
about 9 pence, say, and
with many pubs in Cen-
tral London charging 25
pence or more for a pint,
the profit margin is up
into the 200 per cent
mark. On top of this,
the pubs where the price
is highest are not the
tenant houses but man-
aged joints where the
brewery reaps all the
profit.
Even the bitter prices,
now approaching 20
pence a pint are pulling
in profits well over 100
per cent of cost. And if
Mooney, not renowned
for efficient manage-
ment, can make a profit
out of Tartan at 13
pence a pint, then abso-
lutely everyone can. Just
think, before decimali-
sation, if you would
have meekly handed
over four bob for a pint
of bitter and 5/6d for a
pint of lager.
All of this points the
finger at the big brewe-
ries who are all pulling
in record profits (and
Scottish-Newcastle gave
the biggest donation of
all industry to the Tory
funds for the last elec-
tion).
So next time you're
handing over 26 pence
for a pint of lager re-
member that Boots do a
very nice, easy to make,
home-brew kit making
lager twice the strength
for 4 pence a pint.
And bottled lager?
You've noticed the light
ale bottles are the same
shape as the lagers —
right! With the exception
of Carlsberg Specials
and odd others (the
bottles give them away),
they're from Britain's
Norseland, too.

CONCERT REVIEW
Last Saturday about 1200 people were packed
into the Great Hall when String Driven things,
a [4-piece, drummer-less, Scottish band, took the
stage at 9.15. In the opening number, "Let Me
Down", it was evident that the only English mem-
ber, Graeme Smith, was no slouch on the electric
violin. This was followed by "Then I Met the Lady",
which was quite good despite the rhythm guitarist,
Chris Adams, breaking one of his strings. Filling in
with a shortened version of Dylan's "Just Like a
Woman", they continued and despite the rather off-
putting cries of Genesis from the crowd they finish-
ed well with "Jack Diamond", Chris and Pauline
Adams harmonising nicely, with a lengthy piece on
the violin in the middle. Colin Wilson played bass.
Later, Genesis played very well, though unfortu-
nately the quieter pieces of their music was spoilt
by a persistent buzz from the P.A. A cheer went up
as lead vocalist and flautist, Peter Gabriel, announ-
ced "Watcher of the Skies", and a smile of satis-
faction crept across his face. Otherwise he looked
very sinister with his partly shaved head and dress-
ed all in black.
This was followed by the short story of Uncle
Henry, leading into "The Musical Box", then "Get
'Em Out by Friday" and "Supper's Ready",
which was, perhaps, a little patchy, but was well
received. In it Michael Rutherford played bass-
pedals, 6 and 12-string guitars, and a rather power-
ful bass. Tony Banks played well, as always, on
keyboards and 12-string, Steve Hackett was on
electric and 12-string guitars, and Phil Collins,
wearing only a pair of shorts, worked through an
unusual number of cymbals, and other percussion
instruments.
Last was "The Return of the Giant Hogweed",
containing a well-timed flare and more prancing
around by Peter Gabriel. The encore was a mere
formality, as they returned to conclude with
"Knife". G.J.K.

Entrance 50p
Imagine a building with three large gallery spaces, a long arch equipped
as a theatre, an immense plaza area with its own proscenium overlooked by a
reasturant, with a cinema, with a control room monitoring the output of any
gadget plugged into the "media grid" that covers every part of the building,
with a boutique, with a reading room and possibly a sauna bath. Try ar.j-,l
th.'nk of the best way of getting all these facilities to cluster about each other
so that it would be possible for an audience to circle around the building in
any direction. Now the result of your fantasies might come pretty close to
resembling the facilities offered "Under the Arches": known by some as
Global Village, by others simply as the Village, and by a few simply as "it".
Next, think up a show that uses up every nook and cranny of the building,
a show created out of the synthesis of all the arts in some sort of attempt to
homogenise the abstraction in their separate fields. So what would be the
result? Solid state art? A perceptive totality? Why bother to describe what
"might b e " ?
Here is a rapid breakdown of the ingredients and some of the things we
might be doing: as well as the straight gallery shows by one group of artists,
another might be given enough bread to create work in the building; with
lights, with slides, with any material they wish, also with the sense that
people are watching their work as it grows, that their brothers are bes'rie*
them requiring props, effects, fanfares. Poems might be read among paint-
ings, dancers might discover they are musicians — and you? How will you
react when you walk into a building where a catalogue is simply a field of
words? The leap from the recognisable into the indescribable is bound to
frighten some, but say one imposes this limit on the artists; that within the
wide arena of the show they may only approach people in the terms of their
own art. Dancers shake hands but may not speak, musicians ring bells but
may not move, poets make articulate the schemes of language whilst ventur-
ing no remarks, then fear of knowing and desire to tell may reach equal pitch.
We have plans for operas which may be performed immediately by 200
people, free poems, sculpture for children, acrobatic ballets with full decor
that can be put together in an afternoon, all this linked together by the circus,
which is back in Charing Cross — where the circus began.
Add to these ingredients a Friday night HOP with groups of all descrip-
tions and also what we hope will be a regular jazz venue, and you get the sort
of nameless everything UNDER THE ARCHES could be for you—and for us.
Here's our address UNDER T H E ARCHES, off Villiers Street, Charing
Cross W C 2 . Tel: 839 2803.
