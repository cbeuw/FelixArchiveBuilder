COUNCIL
REFORM
At a stroke!
Imperial College Union Council is in existence to
manage the affairs of the Union but this fact is obs-
cured quite successfully by the extensive discussion of
trivia. This makes the meetings boring by definition
and the 169th which occurred last Monday was no
exception.
Before the reasons for
the failure of Council are
discussed, some examples
of what happens are taken
from the most recent dis-
aster. The minutes of the
previous meeting were ap-
proved. It would have
been difficult to find any-
thing wrong with them
anyway since they had on-
ly been available a few
hours before the meeting!
They run to eight pages,
and include such items as
"Somewhere around here
MCB said T don't want to
be nasty and bureaucratic
about this ! ! "
Although these extracts
might give the impression
that nothing of importance
was discussed, this would
be a wrong conclusion.
Quite relevant items are
introduced into the agenda
such as NUS Elections,
plans for the new hall, ex-
ternal affairs in the form
of the Murray Report, a
new traffic flow scheme for
Exhibition Road, etc. How
ever, these are invariably
pre-packed and require a
large amount of expert
knowledge to comment on
them. In all matters of im-
portance, decisions have
been made before the
meeting which makes it
difficult for Council to
affect the course of events.
Perhaps the most impor-
tant issues, that is those
connected with Union fin-
ance, are the most difficult
to control. It is inevitable
that A C Q RCC & SCC
expenditure will have been
determined before the
meeting with Council be-
coming no more than a
rubber stamp.
Why should this be so
After all, everyone at the
meeting comes with good
intentions. The Executive
of the Union, i.e. the Top
Six in the organisation,
prepare the agenda for
the meetings and deter-
mine how they will be
discussed. This is possible
mainly because there is
no discussion on the im-
portant items!
At this stage it is use-
ful to invoke Parkinson's
Law which goes into some
detail as to the effective-
ness of governing bodies
and councils. Parkinson
draws attention to the
strict relation between the
number of Cabinet Min-
isters and the power the
title "Cabinet" implies,
The magic number is 20;
below this, the cabinet
has an effective say in the
running of the Government
with a consequent limita-
tion of Executive power.
Above this, and a smal-
ler group (approximately
5 or 6) forms which de-
cides policy and presents
it to the castrated rem-
nants of the Cabinet. The
worst case he cites is that
of the USSR which has a
cabinet of 38.
Applying this to ICU
we find it no exception
to the theory outlined.
Council has a member-
ship in excess of 40, even
worse than the USSR!
The Executive group has
taken over all major busi-
ness, and the idea of a
Council which manages
the Union has faded into
the past.
A cursory glance at the
list of Council members
shows how it could be re-
duced below the 20 mark
The concept of a Floor
Rep is misconceived at
the best of times. Theore-
tically they represent the
"ordinary Union mem-
ber," but more often re-
present themselves. This

Presidential Elections again this week
The Presidential elections have come upon us yet again! This time, however, there
are five possible candidates of all political leanings. The Manifestos which are printed
on page 7 go into the candidates' opinions and Felix will not comment on their merits
(or demerits). However, a slight clarification of the situation is necessary.
There are 3 Soc.Soc. candidates but the "official" one is John Lane. Adrian Smith
is standing again and must be congratulated for persistence. The other two are of no
fixed political bias and might succeed in identifying with a large percentage of students.
Remember the Hustings are on Thursday at 13.00 in the Great Hall and are well worth
attending.
Elections are on the Friday and Monday in the JCR-Union Building and South-Side.

is inevitable and it should
be accepted that no-one
should be on council with-
out a specific responsibi-
lity.
The Department reps
could quite easily be tak-
en off Council since the
Academic Affairs Officer
can be responsible for
them.
The CCU Academic
Affairs officers can be dis-
regarded as an office alto-
gether since they have
been made redundant by
the Union officer.
The Old Students' reps
have no right to comment
on the affairs of the Uni-
on and should not be on
Council.

cluded from Council, the

Margate
Conference is the supreme governing body of the
National Union of Students. It meets twice a year,
once in November at Margate and again in April some
Where else (last year Birmingham, this year Exeter).
Conference consists of delegates and observers from all
the 'Constituent Organisations" (C.O's) of the NUS,
the number of delegates being dependent on the num-
ber of students in the college or institution in question.
These are (theoretically) elected by and from the stud-
ents of the college at a UGM—this is the case at IC,
but is not everywhere.
Next weekend sees the N U S Annual Conference
at Margate . . . 32 hours of debating between the
representatives of most colleges and educational m-
stitutions in the Country crammed into one weekewfl
The subjects talked about range from the sublime to
the ridiculous, the standard of debating from highly
responsible to utterly puerile.
What will the conference achieve? What does the
N U S do for you, the students of Imperial College?
Why have a national union at all? Does the NUS am-
eliorate or detract from the image of students general-
ly? How representative is the NUS . . . and how repre-
sentative of the NUS is conference?
These are some of the questions that are always
asked about the NUS, and that we will be discussing
over the next couple of weeks in "Felix." The confer-
ence will be covered in detail by Oliver Dowson audi
Ross McBeath for "Felix"' in the December 5th issue
. . . but a preliminary report will be rushed to the prin-
ters in time for next week's issue.
Each CO is permitted to
submit a certain number
of motions to conference
(IC are entitled to 6), and
when the list of motions,
called the 'Agenda" is
published, C.O.'s are en-
titled to submit amend-
ments to these motions.
There are usually of the
order of 100 motions . .
obviously far too many to
discuss in the limited
time available. (Motions,
by the way, can be about
just about anything—Ed-
ucation, Welfare Inter-
national Affairs, etc., etc.)
In order to cut down the
number drops to about 20,
This is highly desirable
since it will curtail the
powers of the Executive
considerably.
number of motions to a
discussable level {usually
4!) a system of "Priori-
tisation" is used. Each CO
has fifteen priority points,
which it can put in any
combination on the mo-
tions of its choice. For
example, it could give 1
point of each of 15 mo-
tions, or 3 points to 3 mo-
tions and 6 to another, or
put all 15 points on one
motion—it doesn't matter
as long as all the priority
points are used up. When
all the C.O.'s have sub-
mitted their priorities, all
the points for each motion
are added up, and the top
four are put on the order
paper for discussion. This
time they are Grants,
Housing, Representation
and Autonomy, The rest
are put on a reserve list.
By the time all the
amendments are added to
the original motion, these
motions get to be pretty
big and unwieldy things.
It's not unusual to start
with a small motion with
thirty or forty amend-
ments to it, and it's not
unreasonable to suppose
that some of these amend-
ments are pretty much the
same as each other, and
that some of them are non-
contentious . . . i.e. the CO
that put up the original
motion agrees with them.
So, at conference, won-
derful things called 'Com-
positing Sessions" are
held with the intention
and eventual result of
boiling down motions so
that you end up with a
main motion With between
2 and 20 amendments tab-
