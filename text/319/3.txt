Ron, regular da>-time
messenger on the Beit
Archway, is understand-
ably pretty sore about the
Union now. Last week he
was ushered into the sanc-
tum of Carl Seaford,
Domestic Bursar, to hear
that a letter had been sent
"on behalf of the Union"
complaining about him.
According to Ron, the
letter alleges just about
everything against him
except for murder and
rape. Carl wouldn't tell
him who wrote the letter,
though, nor would he tell
NUPE (Nat. Union of
Public Employees—Ron's
union) officials who went
to see Seaford later in the
week. The letter not only
accused Ron of laziness,
slovenliness and insolence,
but even of "dirtiness" . . .
and Ron considers it not
only insulting but libel-
lous. No-one in the Union
office will admit to being
the author of this epistle,
but there are strong
rumours . . . Meanwhile,
Ron is going to be moved
— and he's even sorer
about that.
While hordes of fans
invaded the Union office
on Thursday, that mirror
of hospitality and good-
will, Martin C. Black
(B.Sc, ARCS, Esq., Hon.
Secretary ICU) was away
busying himself with en-
tertaining 25 Russian stu-
dents. Foisted upon him
by the NUS as an early
Christmas present, the
"students" turned out to
be the East European
version of American tour-
ists, resplendent with their
cameras, tape recorders
and balalaikas slung
round their necks. "Spon-
taneously" exchanging
gifts (a 100-rouble note
for a Mines tie-pin), Mr.
Alexei Zagreb Popovich,
73, an average "student"
of the group, told a "Fel-
icity" scout that he loved
all of our filthy capitalist
metropolisoliski" especi-
ally the Crown Jewels and
the Cromwell Road
branch of the Natzional
Vestminster Bank. The
"students" also thrilled to
a Linstead Hall supper,
especially the green beans
which most of them left,
thinking them to be cab-
bage. The student party
has invited MCB to a re-
turn visit to their "col-
lege" in Siberia for a few
years.
A prominent notice on
one of the doors of the
JCR onto the walkway
reads "This door must be
kept open at all times that
people are in the room".
It is not unusual to find
the door still locked at
eleven o'cloek in the morn-
ing.
Are you a table football
addict? City of London
Polytechnic are organising
an inter-collegiate table
f o o t b a l l competition,
which ICU are entering.
If you don't frequent the
Union Bar, odds are
you've never heard of the
aforesaid competition —
and unless you go there
soon, you probably never
will. ICU organiser is
Brendan Clements, and all
preliminary rounds must
be held in the Union Bar
. . . which sounds suspici-
ously like the idea of the
member of the ICU exec.
Who has organised it
(well, where else would
you look for him of an
evening?).
It's about time that Weeks
Hall got their digits extrac-
ted. It's now the only hall
not to have elected its
Hall Committee for the
-year, which the Residence
Regulations laid down by
the College require it to do
at the start of each session.

The Editor of Felix has
been getting famous lately
in the pages of our negli-
gible rival, the RCS
"Broadsheet". Perhaps the
impressive thing about last
week's issue was that none
of the references to the
aforesaid gentleman were
derogatory. If you too
were wondering where
Mr. Dowson was for [he
first half of last week, in-
formed sources (the man
himself) tell us that he
was recovering from ill-
ness contracted from a
SRC meeting and Murray
press conference in close
succession. And if you
were wondering why there
are only 2,000 copies of
Felix, every week for 4,000
students, well, it's 'cos
they cost money. Come to
think of it, the extra £300
a year to print 4,000 cop-
ies per issue might be re-
paid by higher advertis-
ing rates (and make Felix
the 3rd instead of 6th or
7th biggest student paper
in the country). At the
moment the 2,000 copies
that are put on the news
stands at 9 a.m. every
Tuesday morning are
completely gone by 2 that
afternoon. Bears thinking
about. . . .
CEFE, the news-sheet
produced by various mem-
bers of Soc Soc, has been
in existence for a number
of years now. The gap in
communications that was
the original reason for the
starting of .CEFE still
exists today and so it still
performs an important
role. This is best summar-
ised in a brief explanation
of the main aims of
CEFE. The issues written
about are both local and
very general. The local
issues such as student
problems and actions in
I.C., the problems faced
by the workers in I.C. and
the housing situation in
Notting Hill are too small
to merit publication out-
side the college but never-
theless are very important
within it. In the wider as-
pect, issues that affect us
all in one way or an-
other are dealt with in
the news-sheet. Since a
.lumber of individuals
write the articles in CEFE
different views are some-
times put forward on
specific issues but this in
no way detracts from the
importance of CEFE.
The crucial point is that
the importance of the
issues is clearly shown.
CEFE also aims to pre-
sent views which often do
not get wide publicity in
the mass media and to
promote discussion on
these points. When such
views are presented then
discussion can be made by
people balancing two sides
of an argument. The
generally published line
does not always have to
be accepted.
In the "Opinion" col-
umn of Felix these aims
can still actively be pur-
sued. Important topics
can be raised and general
discussion on them pro-
moted. Because of the
w i d e r circulation of
'Felix' it may be that this
will be accomplished more
effectively. If it is then
Felix will begin to fulfil
the only purpose with
which it can justify its ex-
istence — that is as a
means of communication
for the students of l.C.
Communication does not
only involve letting stu-
dents know what is going
on (Wotson) but also in-
volves presenting views
on important issues in
order to promote discus-
sion on these.
Up till now, we have
been treated to the same
lack of priorities, which
has very effectively stifled
all real communication,
from both the editor of
Felix and the secretary of
I.C.U. The editor of Felix
has even at times over-
stepped the limits of
"wrong priorities" to at-
tempt directly to stop
discussion. Do you re-
member the call to "Ab-
stain" at the last elec-
tions? It is possible that
this was a mistake and
the impression of a call
to abstain was not in-
tended (this was indeed
the case—Ed.) but 1his is
not the view taken by a
lot of people. There have
been too many mistakes
that have stopped discus-
sion and too often the
priorities chosen by the
editor of Felix have also
had this same effect. The
extension of room in Fe-
lix for "Opinion", which
can -only help further com-
munication, is a start. The
long term view of this
must be to extend the
scope of this beyond the
few alternative news-
sheets now existing in
college to make Felix an
open and lively means of
communication.*
The secretary of ICU
has had his main effect
on communication at the
Union General Meetings.
Motions dealing with im-
portant issues of concern
to us all have been pushed
to the end of the agenda
and then talked out of the
meeting by long executive
reports. The immediate
answer to this is that
members of the union
should make strong efforts
to ensure the order of the
T H E E D I T O R R E G R E T S that, because of his
illness in the early part of last week, this issue of
"Felix" is not exactly as scheduled. The U N I O N
D I R E C T O R Y , although now ready to print, has
had to be held over because it could not be pre
pared in time for the printers to print the extra
pages required. Felix's promised new look, too,
is incomplete, although certain parts of it have
been included in this issue. Because of various
factors, the only broadsheet represented in our
new "Opinion" page this week is C E F E : "Some-
thing" follows next week and after that, hopefully,
the three constituent college broadsheets and
" C E F E " and "Something" will alternate, the first
three one week, the other two the next.
agenda is agreed at the
beginning of the meeting.
This would make sure that
all the important issues
receive full time for dis-
cussion.
During the election
campaign last spring we
heard many line words
about the communications
amongst students more
efficient. The weekly Fe-
lix, with a sabbatical
editor, was to play a pro-
minent part in this. So far
we have found both
MCB and the editor of
Felix doing exactly the
opposite. In fact, both
these people are actively
trying to stifle communi-
cation.
The opinion page in
Felix may be the begin-
ning of a long haul to-
wards the situation in
which a weekly Felix
could promote and add
to the discussion at union
meetings. In such a situa-
tion Felix would act as a
complement to union
meetings and would thus
improve communications.
