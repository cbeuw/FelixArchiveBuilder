Going Cheap...
Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education:
in the elder, part of experience. Francis Bacon it
was who penned that piece of wisdom. A n d even
allowing for the fact that the world is a much smaller
place these days, his sentiments are as true now
as they were when he wrote them at the beginning
of the 17th century.
But, call it education or experience, travel is big
business these days—and getting bigger. It's been
calculated that on any day, about three-quarters of
a million people—that's equivalent to the population
of, say, Lisbon — are travelling by air from one
country to another. And that is big business.
The cheap package tour is a standard item today.
The air charter business is growing and the fares
to exotic places are getting progressively lower.
The whole structure of expensive and rigidly con-
trolled air fares is beginning to tumble, which means
that even the most ambitious trips to faraway places
are coming within the reach of everyone.
Any time now, the colour supplements, news-
papers and television will be smothered in travel
advertising. Felix Financially is going to jump the
gun a bit and have a look at what is happening in
the travel business.
For the expert view of the travel scene and what
it holds for those who want to get away from it all,
we went to talk to Mr. Brian Powell, managing
director of Sundowners Travel, a large organisation
specialising in overland transportation and air char-
tering operations.
Here's our report:
FELIX FINANCIALLY :
We've all heard a lot in
recent months about the
coming of really cheap
air travel, and that's of
enormous interest to stu-
dents. But is it all talk
—or is it really going to
happen?
POWELL: Yes, it's really
going to happen. At last
— at long last — the
stranglehold with which
the major airlines have
held air fares at an arti-
ficially high level has
been broken, and cheap
air travel is here. For
example, one of our
small airlines took deli-
very last week of a
brand-new 360-seat jet
and they are going to use
it for transatlantic flights
which will cost you only
thirty pounds for a single
ticket to New York. And
after April 1 next year,
when many of the re-
strictions on charter
flights will be lifted,
there will be a lot of
others offering similar
low-fare flying. It's a
major breakthrough in
the travel business and I
think it is very good
news for people like stu-
dents who don't really
care whether they see a
movie while they're fly-
ing the Atlantic, so long
as they get to the other
side.
FF: Good news indeed.
How has it happened?
POWELL: In the past, the
International Air Trans-
port Association—I ATA
—has fixed all schedul-
ed air fares, as well as
laying down minimum
and maximum standards
of passenger comfort. It
meant all airlines were
exactly the same. Com-
petition was eliminated
and fares remained arti-
ficially high only be-
cause most scheduled
flights fly little more than

half full. At the same
time, the airlines did
their best to ignore the
real growth area in air
travel—the air charter
and package tour busi-
ness.
But in the end, they
got the message. Faced
with falling payloads and
the need to buy bigger
and better aircraft just
because everyone else
was doing so, the air-
lines realised that the
only way to operate eco-
nomically was to make
certain they flew with
every seat sold. And
that means the charter
and package tour end of
the business. They
couldn't beat the little
sense, they've come full
circle because it was
they themselves who cre-
ated the air charter
business. When they
bought new aircraft, they
sold the old ones
cheaply to the smaller
fellows. Where the small
fry once flew Dakotas,
they now fly 707's. They
offer luxury flying at
cheap prices — and the
public will always go for
cheap fares.
FF: So cheap flying has
become respectable. But
aren't there still restric-
tions about how and
when you can take cheap
charter flights?
POWELL: Yes, there are.
Cash—
and carrying it
If you're going to travel, what's the best
way to take your spending money? The foreign
manager of an international agency offered
this advice.
Take traveller's cheques that offer replace-
ment against loss. American Express and
Cook's do this. Bank traveller's cheques do
not.
If you don't want to pay the commission on
cheques and prefer cash, you can take up to
fifty pounds in foreign currency with you, so
change your money into Swiss francs or Ger-
man Deutschmarks before you leave. They're
about the safest currencies.
And one other thing: It's welt worth taking
out medical insurance before you go. This is
very cheap. To cover a six-week tour against
accident, sickness, hospital costs, repatria-
tion and luggage insurance will cost about £4.
Considering the kind of trouble you might get
into if you fall sick in some remote place, this
type of insurance is a bargain.
fellows, so, inevitably,
they have joined them.
Some major airlines
threatened to defy IATA,
and from there, the
whole edifice began to
crumble.
FF: Why did they wait so
long?
POWELL: As long as
the scheduled operators
could keep the cheap-
flight charter business
restricted, they were
happy to keep their
monopoly. Chartering
cheap flights was hedged
about with rules about
affinity groups and the
need to join some kind
of club before you were
entitled to fly. But what
finally broke the mono-
poly was a two-fold de-
velopment. First, the
enormous and lucrative
holiday package tour:
and the coming of the
Jumbo jet. Somehow,
they had to fill their ex-
panded seat capacity,
and there was only one
way to do it — sell them
cheaply with block
bookings, guaranteed
weeks before the plane
takes off.
Now, they're all into
it — BOAC, Lufthansa
and all the rest. In a
But that's being chang-
ed, too. From April 1,
1973, the whole business
of having to join a club
— even something as
phoney as The Friends
of Foster's Beer — will
be discarded. You'll be
able to go wherever you
want providing you can
pay the fare. You'll have
to book three months in
advance, of course, but
I think even that will be
reduced eventually.
FF: So the world's our
oyster now, is it?
POWELL: I think so.
Now that we've broken
the old cartel, airlines
are going to be falling
over themselves to cash
in on the tremendous
urge to see the world.
Mind you, they're still
moving much too slowly.
Personally, I'm appalled
at the lack of imagina-
tion displayed. Far too
many people in the
business still think any-
where east of Athens is
over the edge of the
world. But sooner or
later, they'll wake up to
the fact that people now
want to go further and
further abroad, to places
like Rangoon, Bangkok,
Latin America and
Africa. But as yet, we're
only on the brink of a
travel revolution.
FF: But won't all this
cheap travel attract the
sharks — the kind of
operator who might fly
you somewhere and then
leave you stranded?
There seems to be a lot
of them about.
POWELL: I agree that
governments and the tra-
vel business have been
deplorably slow to elim-
inate that kind of bucket-
shop operator. But from
January 1 next year, all
these kind of people will
have to be licensed and
will have to prove they
can do what they say
they'll do. And that can
only be good for every-
one.
We've all been wait-
ing a long time for these
things to happen. There
has been a lot of resis-
tance to the concept of
cheap air travel, a lot of
argument and an incred-
ible degree of short-
sightedness. But it is
happening now.
You can go to New
York for thirty pounds if
you're willing to take
the chance of a seat and
take your own sand-
wiches. If you want to
book ahead, you can do
it for £58 return. Com-
pare that to the sched-
uled fare of £168. And
that's only the begin-
ning. Already a fare of
£125 to Australia is be-
ing mooted and I think
similar cheap flying is
soon going to be avail-
able to anywhere in the
world.
FF: So that's air travel.
What about other ways
of seeing the world?
POWELL: Going over-
land is cheaper still, of
course. It's possible to
get from London to Aus-
tralia by going overland
to Katmandu and flying
from there via Bangkok
and Singapore to Syd-
ney — all for £289. A
42-day tour from Lon-
don to Katmandu and
back can be done for as
little as £105, and that
includes camping on the
way.
In fact. I think the
kind of overland tours
we operate have helped
pioneer all forms of
cheap travel. And can go
where the airlines can't
go. For example, we can
offer a six-week tour of
Eastern Europe, includ-
ing the whole of Russia,
for £110, with combined
camping and hotel ac-
commodation en route.
And now we've opened
up the northern parts of
Africa, too.
The thing is that see-
ing the world no longer
has to be the prerogative
of the wealthy. It's with-
in the reach of every-
one
you.
