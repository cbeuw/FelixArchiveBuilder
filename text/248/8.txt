Krakenauts Ahoy !
Imperial College is breaking into an area of sci«..»tific research
which has previously been dominated by governments and navies.
Project KRAKEN, organised by I.C. Underwater Club, is the
college's underwater living experiment, intended to improve substan-
tially British knowledge in marine science.
For the last ten years Imperial
College, has sent out underwater
expeditions to study topics rang-
ing from diver-to-diver communi-
cation to the .effects of light on
marine life. However, there is
some research work that is diffi-
cult or impossible to undertake
with surface divers. This is gener-
ally for one of three reasons:
The experiment may be des-
troyed by bringing it to the sur-
face, e.g. the swim bladder of a
fish may burst due to the pressure
change. There is a limit on the
time a diver can stay under water
and still surface directly. At 100
feet depth a diver who spends
more than 20 minutes on the
bottom must only ascend in a
slow carefully controlled manner.
This is known as decompressing.
It sets a limit on time and cost
of diving operations at any depth
below 30 feet. However, a diver
living in a bottom laboratory
need only surface once at the end
of the week, he only decom-
presses once per week. Finally,
the surface worker must bear
with the unpleasantness of the sea
surface. Waves, wind and rain
all combine to make life miser-
able for the poor sailor. In some
physical measurements the very
movement of a surface platform
could limit the scope of research.
Having demonstrated a need
for an underwater laboratory on
scientific grounds, the same argu-
ments can be extended to cover
commercial work. But where
could such a structure be ob-
tained. The British Navy do not,
as yet, see a military need for
one, and the cost of building one
on an industrial basis and run-
ning it for research would be pro-
hibitive. This leaves the univer-
sities. This, " Someone must do
it, and we are in a better position
than most" argument has re-
gsulted in KRAKEN. The photo-
graph shows a full size wooden
mock-up of Kraken now at the
College.
Don Boadella
Last year I.C. Union financed
Don Boadella on a trip to Canada
as part of the Great Britain Rifle
Team. He recently wrote to the
Union to tell of his experiences.
Nourished almost entirely on
specially imported Whitbread, it
seems he had a jolly good time
and, furthermore, won all his
shooting matches. He also spent
two days in Montreal at Expo'67.
Any other crackshot wishing to
visit Expo '67 had better apply
quickly—the Union is rapidly
running short of money!
Kraken is named after Lord
Tennyson's sea monster. It is a
four-man house that is scheduled
for launching off Oban on the
West Coast of Scotland in Julv
1968.
The Krakenauts will
breath a mixture of oxygen and
nitrogen at the pressure of the
surrounding water. (This is un-
like a submarine that is protected
against this pressure.) It is this
pressure of 55 pounds per square
inch that will enable them to
enter and leave Kraken at will
through a hole in the floor. The
only restriction is that these men
are forbidden to surface without
first spending many hours in a
special chamber. An attack of
the " Bends " that would follow
if a diver surfaced without this
precaution is one of the main
hazards of this kind of work.
Electric power and air will be
provided by a cable to the sur-
face shore station.
HOME COMFORTS
The Krakenauts, they will be
of both sexes, will find life
rather different to that on the
surface. Frying is not allowed,
frying smells are poisonous at
that depth. Water will not boil
at the normal temperature and it
is dougtful if tea can be brewed.
Beer and even champagne would
be completely flat. However,
they will have all the home com-
forts, hot showers, central heat-
ing, and, we hope, even televi-
sion. They cannot smoke or use
fountain pens (the ink would run
out when the tide went out). The
girls must give up perfume—it
could cause Kraken to explode !
Clothing will have to be simple
and warm.
Kraken, the third deepest long-
term living experiment, will be
breaking new ground on several
fronts. It will be the deepest to
use an air-like gas, it will be the
longest so far, and it will be the
first true underwater laboratory
that will be open to visiting scien-
tists.
To maintain the laboratory in
90 feet of water a support team
of at least 20 will be required.
The personnel will be drawn
from a large number of univer-
sities and research centres in the
country as well as Imperial Col-
lege.
What can the Felix reader do
10 help Kraken. There are a vast
number of jobs waiting to be
done. Whether your skills lie
with a paint brush or a type-
writer, do come and lend a hand.
At the meeting on Thursday
night at 7 p.m. in the Physics De-
partment, the ways in which you
jean help Kraken will be dis-
' cussed.

t h e U n i o n
Imperial College Rugby Club, boasting one of the largest and
strongest memberships of the College, has a very full fixture list
planned this season, including most of the top London Clubs' 2nd
XV's as well as the other London Colleges and Southern Univer-
sities. The club caters for Rugby players of every conceivable stan-
dard. ItfieldsafirstXV team only on Wednesdays, but on Saturdays
as many as ten sides may turn out to play. The dressing rooms and
pitches at Harlington are of a very high standard, and after an after-
noon's matches the club traditionally retires to the bar—where else ?
Last season the 1st XV reached
the final of the University Cup
but after building up an early
lead lost two men and eventually
went down by 14 points to 6.
" Undoubtedly this year the team
will walk away with that coveted
trophy, fate permitting," writes
the secretary. The close season
brings another competition, the
Spakes Cup, variously described
as an intercollegiate bloodbath or
a ninety-minute punch-up, be-
tween I.C.'s three constituent col-
leges. The cup is presented at
the Rugby Club Annual Dinner.
During the Easter vacation the
Club goes on tour. . In the last
three years it has been to Ireland
(twice) and France. Needless to
say the Club claims the wine and
Guinness drinking records of
these countries.
Freshmen should not be put off
by the size or strength of the
Club. For those who like their
Rugby hard and are prepared to
train, a place in one of the first
three or four teams is easily at-
tainable. For those who prefer
lesser or even " coarse " Rugby,
the B XVs will be eminently
satisfactory. The club provides
an excellent opportunity for
meeting other students of every
conceivable type at a very soc-
iable level. The club's president
is Professor Sparkes.
