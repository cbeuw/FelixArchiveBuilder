No matter what kind ot interests you may have, kinky or straight,
you can indulge them in London. London would take a lifetime to
get to know in any full sense of (he word, but here are a few ideas
for starters.
You like beer? " The Bird in Hand " on Rosslyn Hill in Hamp-
stead serves an excellent jar of bitter You like style? South
Kensington has some stylish pubs, but the beer tends to be well-nigh
undrinkable. A notable exception is " The Hoop and Toy " just up
from South Kensington Tube Station. Good beer and beautiful people
are to be found in any number of Chelsea pubs if you're willing to pay
for them.
For atmosphere and ort-beat
characters " The Duke of Wel-
lington " in Portobello Road is
hard to beat; while you're there,
try Henekey's, one block up the
road. You could meet anyone

Join the I.C.T.W.C. (Tiddley-

anarchist or Trotskyist or Young
Conservative. Support Dramsoc
or SocSoc or SickSoc.
In all their cries for attention
at the beginning of the year one
of our greatest assets as a Uni-
versity is often ignored — our
position in the centre of London
—a city which will excite and
depress, infuriate or stimulate.
Whether that stimulus be birds
or music ; whether you want to
lead the life of a hippie or a sober
clerk or a drunkard it's here in
"the smoke."
Martin Walker here gives a
subjective look at London.
from slumming West-enders to a
biochemist collecting semen
samples in test tubes. Notting
Hill Gate has some good pubs
too: the basement of "The Swan"
at the top end of Kensington
Church St. is gently swinging with
original decor, juke box and nice
bar girls. "The Leinster" in Lein-
ster Square is an excellent local
pub complete with coalfire,darts,
mussells and shrimps, the regu-
lars—and good beer. The West
End abounds in pubs of all sorts,
but if you come out of a theatre
near Piccadilly Circus at ten to
eleven with a powerful thirst, try
" Ward's Irish House" on the
north side; beware St. Patrick's
Day
If you are a culture-vulture,
London is unbeatable. It is worth
your while getting programmes of
future events at the Wigmorc
Hall. Allien Hall. 1'cstival Hall,
and Covent Garden. There arc
innumerable films of course, and
live theatre , Cognoscenti from
New York say that progressive
staging has died in London, but
there is nevertheless a lot of
acting talent here, and a play is
worth what it will cost you.
Don't forget the art galleries
and museums; they are good for
many a Sunday afternoon, and
they are free. If it's the under-
ground scene that grabs you—
and I don't mean yo-yoing on the
L.T.C.—there are " The Arts La-
boratory" at 182 Drury Lane, and
" U.F.O." at the Roundhouse,
Chalk Farm. The Arts Lab.
comprises an art gallery, bistro,
bar, and small theatre where
underground — and uncensored
films are shown. Students can join
for £1 and it is well worth it.
" U.F.O." is the Hippy scene and
manages to retain ascendency
over its numerous smaller rivals
despite infiltration by tourists and
teeny-boppers. Here music is the
thing, and " U.F.O." gets very
good groups indeed. It runs from
10.30 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. Fridays.
Flower sheilas abound; not all are
untouchable.
I.C. is notable for its lack of
women, but do not despair, Lon-
don is not. The Royal College
of Art has reputedly very good
dances and definitely has lots of
talent. There are more hops than
you can comfortably shake a stick
at, notably at L.S.E. If all else
fails, try one or more of the
several computer dating schemes.
They are unlikely to find you the
love of your life, but one of your
dates is bound to shape if you've
an ounce of talent. And at £1 it's
cheaper than French lessons.
So much for entertainment, it
you just want something to do,
interesting, different, but free, try
walking around Soho on a Friday
or Saturday night from 8.00 or
9.00 p.m. onwards. It is a fasci-
nating place, and there is very
much more than ageing strippers
and second floor massage. In
fact, generally speaking now, it is
interesting to savour the flavours
of different areas in London.
Hampstead Village for example is
quaint, olde worlde and very arty-
crafty Paddington is tough and
ugly Notting Hill is on the way
up and one sees, but never seems
to meet, incredibly gorgeous birds
wandering about—try Mac Fishe-
ries on Saturday. South Kensing-
ton is different again, and Chelsea
—a smarter, wealthier Hamp-
stead. If you aspire to the
switched on swinging London
scene of Time, Inc. try the King's
Road. It's expensive, and people
spend all of their time looking at
each other, and nobody will look
at you unless you have a crotch-
length skirt or are a pop star, but
it's amusing nevertheless. To get
deeper into London, it is essential
to visit at least some of London's
many markets. Here you will find
the surviving genuine Londoners,
a vanishing breed of men, gener-
ous and warm with a repartee
that will leave your head spinning.
Try Billingsgate at 5.00 a.m. on a
weekday morning. Shepherd's
Bush or Portobello Road on
Saturday The latter is a favour-
ite Hippy hangout perhaps be-
cause of the bells, bangles and
beads to be found there. It is
interesting to visit the market in
the afternoon and the pubs in the
evening; the people arc quite
different- day people and night
people.
Then there are the parks. They
too have their own unique charac-
ters, from the vastness of Hyde
Park to the prettiness of Berkeley
Square or the formal gardens of
Regent's Park. It is worthwhile
looking at all of them; they arc ail
within easy reach, and are a balm
to a blown mind or a broken
heart.
For acadaemia outside I.C it
is worth mentioning that London
houses some of the world's best
libraries. Near to l.C. is the
Science Museum Library which
all I.C. students can join, gratis
it has marvellously obscure jour-
nals on topics you've never heard
of. There are Senate House, and
nearby University College Li-
braries; both are excellent. You
are unlikely to need it, but if you
do, there's the British Museum.
If you prefer to buy your books,
the best bookshops are probably
Dillon's near Senate House,
Lewises across the road from
U.C. Hospital, and Claude Ciill
on Oxford St. opposite Selfridgcs.
For the way-out try Indica
Books, it has Zen Macrobiotics,
just in case you didn't know
By the way, I.C. runs Touch-
stone weekends at the College
field station near Ascot, so if you
get fed up to the teeth with Lon-
don's incessant noise and inescap-
able exhaust fumes, by all means
get out.
