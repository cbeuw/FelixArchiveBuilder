Ray Phillips, ebullient President of I.C. Union, has provided
FELIX with its first scoop of the year by revealing hitherto unsus-
pected facts about his formative years, both in and out of I.C.
Born in 1945 (just too late io win the war single-handed) in
Carshalton, he lived and learned in Suburbia. At the tender age of
thirteen, however, he was exported to Hampshire to complete his
so-called education at Barton Reveril Grammar School, Eastleigh.
There his activities ranged far; he sang the part of the sergeant
of police in Gilbert and Sullivan's " Pirates of Penzance" and
developed prowess in thefieldswhich was later to earn his reputation
at I.C. He played hockey (for Hants County Schools team) and cricket.
In 1963, having obtained an
entrance scholarship, he arrived
at I.C. to read Chemistry. He was
fortunate in entering Beit Hall
but the rest of his first year is
covered in silence; the law of
libel forbids speculation on this
topic.
In his second year Ray Phillips
took hisfirstUnion posts as Trea-
surer of I.C. Hockey Club and
Chemistry second year represen-
tative. Despite these laudable at-
tempts he did not gain readmis-
sion to Beit and had to commute
from the depths of darkest Ful-
ham. However in his third year
he returned to the campus once
more as Captain of I.C. Hockey
Club. He retained his connection
with R.C.S. by representing them
on the Athletic Grounds Com-
mittee. He further entrenched
himself in the corridors of power
by serving on Beit Hall committee
and later the selection committee.
These activities did not disturb
the balance he had struck suffi-
ciently to prevent him gaining an
Upper Second degree which en-
abled him to return to do research
in the Chemistry department with
a view to eventually obtaining a
PhD.
His first year PG was combined
with the Chairmanship of the
Athletic Clubs Committee into
which he introduced what he,
with uncharacteristic modesty,
describes as " startling reforms."
He continued to play hockey, this
time for the University of London
Union. As a result of his chair-
manship he obtained a third year
in Hall, this time deserting Beit
for Tizard.
This then is the President of
I.C. Union. He wants " a fair
crack of the whip for students "
and is going " to attempt to in-
volve apathetic students by better
advertising" and wants to remove
the main cause of anti-union feel-
ing by revising the attitudes of
Union officers.
The Phoenix
arises
once
more
Despite a slight setback during
the Summer Vac, the financial
prospects of THE PHOENIX are
brighter than they have been for
two years. Response to adver-
tising circulars sent to all major
industrial companies shows a
considerable interest on their
part in publishing two editions
this year. (In recent years it has
been usual to publish two edi-
tions but last year delays in the
production of the first edition
precluded a second.) It is also
hoped to reduce the high produc-
tion costs by adopting a different
method of printing.
V a r i e d m a t e r i a l
n e e d e d
A major feature of thefirstedi-
tion will be a group of articles
already commissioned on various
aspects of solitude and loneliness.
More articles on other subjects
are still required, however, to en-
sure a good balance of content.
Poems and short stories are also
required. It is hoped to make
greater use of photographs than
in the past, as well as line and
half-tone drawings. Editor Colin
Harrison said recently "I should
like it to be felt that this magazine
is produced by people throughout
the Union and not by a small
group as must be the case with
FELIX." To make possible the
correct preparation of copy for
the printers, articles, poems,
stories, photographs, drawings
and ideas are required as soon as
possible, at the latest by October
31st.
They may be left, addressed
to The Phoenix, in the Felix rack
in the Union or delivered to
Room 94, New Beit.
City & Guilds
College
Open Day
The recently completed City &
Guilds building will be open to
the public on 26th October 1967.
This includes the Departments of
Aeronautics, Chemical Engineer-
ing & Chemical Technology,
Civil Engineering, Electrical En-
gineering and Mechanical Engin-
eering. The College will be open
from 2.30 to 7.30 p.m.
COLCUTT
Colcutt was a builder, he con-
structed a tower, a tall tower,
since demolished, from which to
view the Imperial scene. For
many a year Colcutts have sur-
veyed the scene from this lofty
column. It is often a lonely point
of view and the column is fre-
quently reviled as a foul miscon-
struction.
I address these words to the
mass of innocent Freshmen lest
they fear that no one cares. Col-
cutt cares! The few remaining
second and third year students are
well aware of Colcutt's activities
(if not his name). Which brings
me to my first point, gentlemen.
It is now a commonplace to re-
mark the decreased number of 6th
Formers who decide to read
science or technology; we read
frequently of the numbers of va-
cant places in Physics or Civil
Engineering at this or that univer-
sity. Yet curiously the intake into
this College increases as ever.
Even more curiously the increase
in the number of graduates from
some departments rises less
steeply than the intake. Curious
too that although the first year
Physics intake is around the 200
mark, there are only 180 places
in the second year laboratories.
Is it fair (or right) to condemn
20 students (who 'have worked
hard to get here) before they see
a problem sheet? Consider fur-
ther that last year's third year
Physics lectures were given in
theatres capable of seating 120.
To gain entrance to a university
a student must be among the top
four percent of this country's
brain-power. Is it good sense to
decree that 10, 20 or 30 of these
entrants are only good to be
pruned away and thrown on the
rubbish heap in order that Im-
perial College may have a reputa-
tion for producingonly topquality
graduates? Perhaps our new,
though tardy, Rector can reassure
us on this matter.
O b s t r u c t i o n
it is well known thai copies ot
trenx ao not give goou protection
against the coiu i^onuuii iNigms.
for mose ot you wno are nuuuieu
on tnc diioaiikmeius, l reconi-
menu that you gainer as many
copies ot bennet as you requnc
(it s r K t t ioiks: !) and uistnouic
tne thick heavy, woolly pages
aoout your shivering toirn. DO
not, however, despair; the student
house is on us way! there is, 1
am told, a slight delay at present
whilst tne present occupant gets
a divorce. Willing co-iespouuents
should apply to Miss M . Burns,
.aoutnside.
A s e v e r
it is said that immunity to
poisons can oe ootaineu Dy taking
small, irequent doses oi tnem. it
seems that even this comiorting
thought does not induce the i c
student to patronise the Mooney
empoiia. expenditure on the
provision ot a Dalanced, whole-
some diet tor the College rose last
year Dy around 7 per cent, but the
overall loss, despite the continued
bar-boom, rose Dy 4000 per cent.
We can, of course, blame St,!',
the weather, the inconvenience oi
having to walk to the refectories
and actually having to wait to be
served, but these (as usual) leave
something to be desired.
Good luck Freshers they say
the hrst two weeks arc the worst.
