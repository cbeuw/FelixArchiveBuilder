A delegation of I.C. post-
graduates is to call on officials
df the Science Research Council
to press for a £70 p.a. London
Allowance for S.R.C. supported
postgraduates. This was decided
at a meeting of Physics P.G.'s on
12th July, organised by the I.C.
branch of the Association of
Scientific Workers. The meeting
also agreed to ask for the earn-
ings limit to be raised. It is ex-
pected that meetings in Chemis-
try and Guilds will also endorse
these demands.
J. G. Wilson was elected Phy-
Postgrads ask
sics representative on the delega-
tion, which will be led by
A.Sc.W branch secretary H.
Fairbrother, a lecturer in the
Maths, department.
Mr. Fairbrother opened the
meeting with an account of the
history of negotiations with the
D.S.I.R. (Dept. of Scientific and
Industrial Research) and the
S.R.C. since 1962, when the
P.G.'s London allowance of £60
was abolished. He also pointed
out that undergraduate students,
lecturers and technicians all. re-
ceive a London allowance, and so
do the Civil Servants who de-
cided that P.G.s could do with-
out.., In fact the P.G. now gets
less, per week spent at College,
than an undergraduate. The
A.Sc.W has produced a docu-
ment giving the background to
the claim. The values of D.S.I.R.
studentships jn the period 1953
to 1962 included between £40 and
£60 London differential. To
justify removing this in 1962, the
Civil Service produced a 4-year-
old survey of 170 postgraduates
at 11 universities to show that
Londoners lived adequately and
for more
no more expensively than their
provincial colleagues.
The next year, A.Sc.W mem-
bers held a more detailed survey
of 250 London postgraduates,
which showed that using the
same yardsticks as the Civil Ser-
vice survey, nearly £600 p.a. was
a reasonable figure for London
living. Official arguments that
" students should expect to make
sacrifices," are also easily an-
swered, since all students should
make the same sacrifices. At I
present, London P.G.'s make a
double sacrifice.
The Governments'finalanswer
is always the same : " the Nation-
al cake isn't big enough "; but at
a conservative estimate the value
of graduates entering industry
each year is equivalent to a £500
million increase in the cake. This
makes the Government's discrim-
inatory penny-pinching look more
than pound foolish.
Sixth Formers Spurn Science
APPLICATIONS
DROP
" If pupils turn away from science at the top of the secondary
school and at the entrance to higher education . . . then something
has gone wrong on the way," declared Miss Alice Bacon, Minister
of State for Education and Science, in Leeds on September 5.
This tendency is reflected in the situation at I.C., where 20 per
cent less applications for places were received this year.
The facts about the trend away
from technology should certainly
provide food for thought for the
powers-that-be, especially in this
College. The drop in applica-
tions for university places in
science and technology is reported
to be quite widespread—not just
in England but on the Continent
as well. People are going for the
social sciences, because the
science courses are too difficult.
FELIX was told by a member of
staff responsble for selection in
one of the big departments that
this will probably mean that
schools will have to change their
syllabuses. Whether the schools
will agree with this diagnosis, of
course, remains to be seen.
Miss Bacon, who was address-
ing the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, said
there was a sense in which the
spirit of science was more active
in a progressive infants (school
than in any subsequent part of
the education service. There you
had children finding out for them-
selves about the qualities of ma-
terials—of water and sand, and
paint and clay—and about their
everyday environment, with a
freshness and a sense of wonder
that somehow got lost as their
learning became more sophisti-
cated and more rooted in the
given truths of the tex&book. If
there was a turning away from
science at the top of the secon-
dary school and at the entrance to
higher education—and this was a
subject about which we needed
to know a great deal more—then
something had gone wrong on
the way.
It was important, of course,
when we talked about a shortage
of scientists and technologists, to
keep a clear perspective. In 1966
pupils following A level second
year studies confined to mathe-
matics and science totalled 36,000
compared with 30,000 three years
earlier. Moreover one of the
highly promising growth points
was mixed courses combining
science with other subjects. Here
the growth was from 6.000 to
11,000. Since the beginning of
the sixties science entries at O
level were up from half a million
to three-quarters and passes from
300,000 to over 400,000. At A
level, passes were up from 77,000
to 115,000. All this of course
would be reflected in the size of
what was called the active stock
of qualified scientific and techno-
logical manpower, which rose 15
per cent in the three years to
1965 and was expected to rise at
about the same rate in the three
years to 1968. Nevertheless it
was unlikely that demand in im-
portant sectors, notably industry
and the schools, would be met by
the end of the decade. So we
needed to keep the spirit of won-
dering empiricism alive if more
young people were to leave the
schools and the colleges still car-
ing and still curious about the
on-going transformation of life
and work that was the hall-mark
of the twentieth century.
If yon want pen, pad or paper, Veronica will have the answer. She
can be found on most days in the Union bookstall.

The Union is holding the Com-
memoration Day Ball at the
Royal Garden Hotel on Oct. 26th.
Double tickets price 5 gns. are
available from the Hon. Sec. of
the Entertainments committee,
IC Union Office. Dancing will be
from 9 p.m. till 2.30 a.m., and
then will be a running buffet
from 9 p.m. onwards.
They're d r u n k for
This week allfirst-yearstu-
dents will be receiving a ques-
tionnaire. Its subject is the drink-
ing of alcohol and the senders of
the questionnaires want to know,
among other things, whether
people drink and what they feel
about this and about other people
drinking alcohol.
The questionnaires are being
sent by a Research Team at Lon-
don University's Institute of
Psychiatry. This team, which
consists of psychologists, psy-
chiatrists and social research
workers are trying to find out
more about the social habits of
drinking and about the medical
problem of alcoholism. They
have designed this questionnaire
to meet modern requirements of
knowledge
questionnaire design and their
experience has been that people
find the subject a fascinating one
and find the questionnaire ab-
sorbing.
The researchers stress that they
are interested in what everybody
has to say about the subject;
they want everybody to reply
even if they have never had a
drink in their lives. They are
also entirely dependent on the
willingness offirst-yearstudents
to co-operate in this research and
they feel that the research will
be useful only if everyone who
receives a questionnaire fills it in
and sends it back. Sending the
questionnaire back will be easy
as there will be clearly marked
boxes in the College into which
completed questionnaires can be
put. Or, students may return the
questionnaires via the College in-
ternal postal service.
A member of the team will be
in attendance in the Students'
Union during the week following
the sending of the questionnaire
in order to discuss the survey
with anyone interested. Later on,
the team will again be in the
College to discuss the results.
All replies are going to be treated
as strictly confidential and no-
body will be asked to put their
names on the questionnaires.

BIG
LOSS
The refectories have made the
biggest loss in their history in the
year ended July 1967. It is very
probable that to offset their losses
in the coming year, prices will
have to be raised on a large
number of items.
Gross takings for the year
amounted to £170,870. This is
an increase on previous years
but while receipts have increased
costs have multiplied more
rapidly. Mr. Mooney the Re-
fectory Manager blames the loss
on increases in wages and a large
increase in the cost of living.
However while wages have in-
creased by £4000 this is a smaller
increase than in previous years
and the trend could well have
been predicted. Food prices
however have only risen by 4 per
cent.
It is believed that the Union
and Southside bars continued to
make a profit and hence the bars
in many ways continue to subsi-
dise the refectories.
The prices in the refectories
have remained static for two
years. It is now almost inevitable
that they will be increased.
STUDENT
HOUSES
The first IC student house,
which was to have opened at the
beginning of this academic year,
has not in fact materialised. A
statement issued by IC Executive
makes this clear:
" The report on Student
Houses which occupied so
much time at Council last
session, was presented to the
Governing Body on May 12.
It was very favourably re-
ceived by the Governors who
agreed that a pilot scheme
should be started as soon as
possible.
It was hoped that IC's
first Student House would be
open at the beginning of this
session but although plans
were well advanced, legal
difficulties outside the Col-
lege's control have caused
some delay.
At the moment it is not
known when thefirstHouse
will open, but if it is a suc-
cess it is hoped to extend the
scheme."
