GENERAL STUDIES
A new year, a new term—a new series of General Studies lec-
tures. Personalities speaking this year include old favourites like
Benny Green and a number of stimulating and new faces.
For the benefit of freshers—and what isn't this week ?—General
Studies lectures are given during the lunch hour every Tuesday and
Thursday on an almost unrestricted range of extra-curricular topics.
For those who wish to hear about more than just science during their
stay at I.C. these lectures are highly recommended.
This term the series is to cover
a broad scope. Among the
speakers are Mrs. B. Horton who
speaks on communication at
work, Benny Green who gives his
views on aspects of jazz and Miss
Mayer-Lissmann, who discusses
Wagner's "The Ring." There
will also be a group of lectures
on " Cosmology," in which,
among other things, the current
conflicting " Big-bang" and
"Steady state" theories of the
universe are considered; a series
of recitals by actors and musi-
cians of poetry and music; an
important set of lectures by Mr.
John Burrows on Social Policy
Today and Tomorrow, discussing
the Welfare State and its prob-
lems, our educational systems and
our National Health Service; and
a number of documentary films
about Twentieth Century history.
The full details and dates of these
lectures are available in General
Studies programmes which are
distributed about the College.
Touchstone
Another way in which to break
the routine is to go on a Touch-
stone weekend. There are two of
these this term; forty students and
staff gather at Silwood Park, /the
College field station, for a Satur-
day night and Sunday morning of
free and vigorous discussion on
an important topic of general
interest. Touchstone weekends,
held in the country near Virginia
Water, can be immensely relax-
ing after the noise of London.
Among the topics set for this term
is " Sex problems of undergradu-
ates and their solution" led by
Dr. Wendy Greengross, whose
General Studies lectures last year
were the most popular by a large
margin. Details of other subjects
have not yet been released.
M r s B . H o r t o n
MRS. B. HORTON is speaking
on Oral Communication at Work.
She claims to be following an en-
tirely new line in this field, the
fruits of which should appear in
her lectures, and has recently
been applying her ideas in a York-
shire coal mine. Her previous
activities have been many, such
as a journalist, BBC producer and
historian. She has written a bio-
graphy of Anthony Trollope. and
also two novels " too long ago to
remember." The subject of her
lectures could become important
and will certainly be interesting to
those planning a career fin in-
dustry.
Opera Mrs. B. Horton
Miss ELSE MAYER-LISMANN
is a founder and director of Opera
Workshop and passionately devo-
ted to opera. She holds an Hon-
ours degree from and is a special
lecturer in the Royal College of
Music. She also lectures on such
occasions as the Edinburgh Festi-
val and at Glyndebourne and is
certainly a well-qualified speaker
to discuss Wagner's " The Ring."
S M A L L A D S
Pete Ruhemann wishes to an-
nounce that he will be at College
during the session 1967-68.
Jazz Critic Benny Green
BENNY
GREEN
A well-known and popular
personality at I.C. this term will
be Benny Green. He will talk
in General Studies on "Aspects
of Jazz."
At present jazz critic of the
" Observer," he has had a long
and varied career either playing
jazz or talking about it. Born
1927, he was a full-time jazz
musician from 1947 to 1960 and
played with a large number of
well-known bands in this period.
Playing either baritone or tenor
sax, he worked with such well-
known figures as Ronnie Scott,
Dizzy Rees, Stan Kenton and
Ralph Sharon. His tastes in jazz
and, of course, particularly in the
saxophone tend towards the clas-
sic greats and away from the
modern avant-garde school. When
questioned about his tastes, he
admitted that he considered Or-
nette Coleman's music as " rub-
bish—and you can quote me on
that " (so we did). Among saxo-
phonists he favours Lester Young,
Charlie Parker, Coleman Haw-
kins and Stan Getz and he also
appreciates the work of Billie
Holliday and Duke Ellington,
Bix Beiderbecke and Paul Gon-
salves. All this will probably be
reflected in his lectures.
His other enterprises have
included participating in a Poetry-
Music Theatre collaboration
called " Of Eros and of dust,"
and writing two books—" Re-
luctant Art," about jazz and
" Blame it on jmy Youth," an
autobiography. He describes
himself as " a mechanical imbe-
cile " and is a blunt but witty
speaker. His lectures should be
well worthwhile—they were last
year.
