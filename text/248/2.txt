FELIX
RORY REDMAYNE
PARKING OR RATHER
NOT PARKING
Despite protests from all and sundry, not least the College
authorities, the Westminster City Council (W.C.C.) has decided that
parking meters should be introduced by January next year throughout
their area—including all the College environs north of Imperial Insti-
tute Road. This of course raises immediate problems for members
of IC for whom even now parking is difficult.
The current demand for parking
bays at College seems to amount
to 650 non-resident College
members and 150-200 residents
who own cars and keep them at
IC. In College controlled areas
there are only 400 parking
spaces. Clearly a " free-for-all "
in the use of these spaces is im-
practical because of the uncer-
tainty of finding a space, having
already brought one's car into
town. Therefore the Parking
Committee has recently been
giving its attention to the prob-
lem of fair allocation. This body
is one of the Rector's committees
and has a student representation
of two. It has, I understand, put
a number of proposals to the
Rector for establishing a system
for parking allocation.
STUDENTS MOST
VULNERABLE
As far as this issue goes, the
sluder*s are undoubtedly the
most ilnerable group concerned,
having neither the prestige of the
staff nor the militant union of
the technicians. We must there-
fore await the Rector's decision.
Of the 400 College bays a num-
ber must clearly be set aside for
essential car users — disabled
people, college vehicles and Pro-
fessorial staff, and so on. Be-
yond this however, the fairest
system of allocation would be to
select from a joint pool of com-
muter staff and students, accord-
ing to their need. In this way,
although the percentage of park-
ing spaces for students would
probably not compare favourably
with that for staff .there would at
least be spaces for essential users
such as union officials, Felix staff
and those whose journey to col-
lege is particularly difficult by
nublic transport.
EXPENSIVE
In order to make best use of
the available space I think
that few bays should be allo-
cated in college areas for resi-
dents because the W.C.C. has
agreed that people in hall may
register as residents of Westmin-
ster after the first month of each
session, thus entitling them to
metered parking space at 2/6 a
day, which is very favourable
compared to the 1/- an hour for
commuters. If the college au-
thorities feel that resident staff
have a case for cheaper parking
by virtue of their hall suite being
their home then surely it is
worthwhile for them to subsidise
their residents' parking facilities
in order to keep vacant college
bays for commuters, for whom
street parking will be so expen-
sive.
COLLEGE TO HIRE SPACES?
Further, I wonder if it is pos-
sible for the college to perma-
nently hire from the W.C.C. cer-
tain metered bays (at the normal
commuter rate) so that those who
think it worth while to come by
car may have the certainty of a
street bay which they could hire
sessionly or termly from the col-
lege.
COMMEMORATION DAY
The Special Visitor at this
year's Commemoration Day will
be the Rt. Hon. Lord Kings
Norton, PhD, DIC, DSc,
MlMechE, FRAeS, FInstF,
FIAeS, Fellow of Imperial Col-
lege.
Lord Kings Norton was a
student in the Department of
Aeronautical Engineering from
1922 until 1926, receiving his
PhD and DIC in 1926. From
1931-39 he was special lecturer in
the same department, on the sub-
ject of " Structure and Strength
Of Aircraft."
The timetable for Commemora-
tion Day includes an inter-de-
nominational service in Holy
Trinity Church, Prince Consort
Road, conducted by the Rev D.
W Cleverly Ford, with a sermon
by the Rev. Dr A. Marcus Ward

ROVER CREW IN ICELAND
Whatever system is employed
the fact remains that the supply/
demand ratio is greater than 1 : 2
for bays in college and so inevit-
ably half the present car users
will have to pay or not park. I
fear that students will have to
accept that we will probably be
worst hit and so plan accordingly.
Nordusjokull Torfajokull
The steaming edge of the
crater of Helka, a snowcapped
volcano, was one of the more
spectacular camping sites of the
I.C Rover Crew expedition to
Iceland.
The others were rather more
sedate affairs, but nevertheless the
crew managed to get its fair share
of exercise and adventure. Twelve
members sailed to Iceland last
holiday armed with,a minibus.
They set up a base in Reykjavik
and then drove to Landmanner-
lavger via a long and perilous
route. Having successfully over-
come the hazards of lava fields,
soft sand, mud and wide rivers,
the crew camped upon their crater
and from there climbed such
peaks as Kaldaksfjoll, and crossed
the icecap of Torfajokull. They
then moved on to Karkingerfjoll
and climbed Snaekollir and Nor-
dirsjokull and other well-known
Icelandic peaks, making full use
of the 24-hour Icelandic daylight.
The meet ended in traditional
style with—what else ?—a mighty
drinking session.
