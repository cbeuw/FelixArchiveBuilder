Well done to all those who found
CHALFONT AND LATIMER as the
tube station last week. A big well done
to the Harry Potter Trio who were
victorious. Here’s another one for you
to all mull over.

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 119?
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and every word
has a value equal to sum of the values
of its letters. Scan and send the Un-
derground station that is hidden each
week to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
