COFFEE BREAK
Wacko-scopes! Jack0-scopes that love little boys
It’s official: The twisted freak who writes these horoscopes is a pervert and a registered sex offender
Cancer
Hey guys! Jealous
that girls get multiple
orgasms but you have
to suffice with one
moment of purple
headed custard
chucking satisfaction? Well the clever boys
at Imperial College Chemistry Department
have created a pill that will keeping jizzing all
night long. Just send £1.525 to youdumbfuck@
imperial.ac.uk
Virgo
Oh God, here we go
again, the DJ’s put on
Journey. Now I have to
endure every pathetic
cunt scream DON’T
STOP BELIEVING in
my face as if they have to prove they know the
lyrics. Don’t you see that every idiot who sings
‘I’m just a small time girl’ in a falsetto voice is a
fucking twat! The song’s shit, Journey are shit,
the 80’s are shit! FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU-
Gemini
You can’t ignore your
recent fetishes for
Jedward. John natu-
rally has the best lips
so he would go below
and your face would
look great planted inbetween Edward’s tight
arse cheeks. And then you could easily fit both
of their skinny long cocks up behind. Oh it will
be bliss! Unfortunately Simon Cowell kicked
out Lucy instead (she’s in my cellar now).
Pisces
This weekend you’ll
get fucked on the
lastest plant fertiliser
that is kicking around.
You’ll chat too much
balls and drink too
much fag ash. You’re friend has disappeared with
that strapping sporty looking guy and you really
need a shit. Why walk to the toilet when that girls
chest will do instead? Smear it in a bit, it’s modern
art!
Leo
Please love, wear a bra
today. I saw you out-
side Huxley the other
day, your niples were
like bullets poking out
of some of the largest
melons I’ve ever seen. They turned me on in
1.236s exactly. I had two options; hide my massive
erection in the railing or go show it to my lecturer.
I chose the former, it got stuck and the fire brigade
had to come. It really hurts you bitch!
Aries
Here’s a great idea:
Take the little overseas
fresher who’s strug-
gling with the English
language and teach
him the proper way
to speak. Sit back enjoy the carnage as he calls
his lecturer a cumdumpster, and refers to the hall
warden as a cock-jockey. Wallow with devious
satisfaction as he alienates everyone now and falls
into the traditional life of isolation that is Imperial.
Scorpio
Today you’ll meet a nice
charming man. He’s
extremely good looking
and very intelligent.
Don’t be fooled though,
his house party might
sound fun but it’s not really much of party, why are
you the only girl there? Come see my cellar pretty
little fresher, your my wife now! I haven’t decided if
you’re going to be my personal favourite or to sell
you to another creepy pervert in Chinatown.
Libra
Hello again my little
fresher friend. How are
you enjoying World of
Warcraft? You haven’t
emerged from your
room in four days and
your bin has started to overflow with sloppy
faeces. You’re addiction is not healthy one bit.
You need a new vice, how about Heroin? I’m
going to sneak into room and give you a big dose
of junk. You’ll be my bitch then and I have needs.
Taurus
Mars is high above
the Penisata Major
constellation with
Venus lurking down
below the Beaver.
This brings the red
giant Clitorati in opposition against the two
fingers of the twin galaxy SmellyX10 which
makes an angry mess in the sky. The triple
conjunction of Saturn, Chlamidiron and the
star A1d5 heralds a sudden end to your life.
Capricorn
Police raided my house
I’m afraid. They confis-
cated my entire collec-
tion claiming it violated
their ‘human rights’
. I
didn’t know sex slaves
had human rights. They also found half a kilo of
coke and 500 pills. I blamed it on my housemate,
he’s black so they didn’t believe him. Anyway I
need some fresh produce, why don’t you hunt
some American girls with me in the union. Pint?
Aquarius
This week Gok Wan
gives you a makeover.
First he removes your
glasses, that instantly
makes you better
looking. Next he ap-
plies some makeup with his magic wand. Who
knew that they had makeup for your throat?
Tastes a bit cheesy. Oh come on now, no one’s
going to see my bum Gok. ‘It’s not Gok, it’s
Dan’. Oh I couldn’t tell the difference.

Sagittarius
I honestly have a
cellar in my house. It
currently conatins a
nice Romanian (very
dirty!), a pair of Filipino
twins and this Scouser
bird I found rummaging through my bin. Ever
wondered what happened to Madelaine Mcann?
She’s down there too, I had to trade my entire
supply of Thai ladyboys for her. Worth every
penny though.
