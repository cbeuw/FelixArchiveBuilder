quickly and efficiently with the three
word rule. Forget about conjunctions
or auxillery verbs, just get it out in
three words. Exceed this limit and you
risk afflicting a cranial overload, result-
ing in a convulsing, foaming mess.
In this case, Martin the middle-class
gentleman has broken the three word
rule and has paid for his mistake. It is
likely he will not receive his broadband
for another six weeks.

There is simply no way to avoid them.
They swarm the streets, Somerfield
bags in hand, protuberating stomachs
enhanced by an ill-fitting sequin crop-
top and a sagging vagina that has seen
far too many heads pass its gates.
And those heads go on to become
walking JD sports bargain bins, with a
mental capacity rivalling that of their
pet Rottweiler, Biggie Smalls.
With the dog collecting the post,
defending the house and paying the
bills, you wonder who really is the
man of the house? Surely not that fat
intoxicated inarticulate cunt watching
Sky Sports HD on his 52 inch plasma
screen, purchased on a thirty two year
payment plan from Asda?
So how do we deal with the proletar-
iat of our society? Here are some useful
tips for minismising the time you have
to spend in their company.
Tip 1 - The Three Word Rule -
The working class communicate in a
series of grunts and profanities, i.e.
‘Ruh Ruh, facking gaff gaff ruh bur duh’
translates to ‘ Where’s the job centre?’
Whilst interacting with such primi-
tive mammals can be a harrowing
experience, you can deal with them

Tip 2- USCT and how to avoid it-
You’re boiler has broken. The boiler is
still broken. You ring ‘Ed’s Plumbtastic
plumbing corp.’ Knock at door. Open
door. Confronted with toothless sloth
carrying a spanner and a hazy stare at-
tributed to a youth spent sniffing glue
and drinking White Lightning on a
park swing. He says, ‘I’ve come to fix
your boiler mate.’

DISCLAIMER
To combat USCT, try taking the
same approach and start talking to the
boiler man like he is your best friend.
Research the Premiership standings
and players currently on form.
Use rhetorical questions like, ‘Hodg-
son eh? What a twat’ or “What’s that
Anthony Gardener all about?” If he
asks you to elaborate, diligently coun-
ter-attack with the offer of a cup of tea,
or ‘a brew’.
Make sure you have an oversized
man mug prepared, with a witty chau-
vinistic phrase, such as ‘WOMEN ARE
SHIT’, slapped on the side.
Thrust the boiling tea into his hand
so hard that it spills over and scolds
him. He will respect this gesture of
manliness and congratulate you on
such a manly tea-thrust.
With your pseudo-friendship now in
place, you can safely leave boiler man
alone to install the boiler without the
fear of having to Detol his piss out of
your sink.
Tip 3- Just give up
When your Waitrose self-service
check-out tells you that the bagging
area contains one too many organic
carrots, despite you knowing other
wise, you will be forced to witness a
Titanic battle between a dimwitted
malfunctioning heap of shit and the

Now before you interject and tell the
sales assistant that he is actually stand-
ing in the bagging area, let him work it
out for himself.
Watching the working class is like
watching a dog sniff its own shit. A
brief look of confusion, a longer look
of confusion - oh wait. I did this. This
is my fault. Run away and let someone
else deal with it.
That’s right. You can’t win. They are
prolific breeders. They outnumber
you.
Their twelve retarded children will
beat the shit out of your two well-
educated darlings before egging your
house and stealing your lawnmower
and there’s nothing you can do about
it. So just to sit it out in silence and play
Trivial Pursuits.
It’s all very well telling the drunken
footballer that you have a degree in
physics, but he’s already punched you
in the face and poured his beer down
your Chinos.
There is one way you can get back at
him! Buy another pair of Chinos. Ahh
yeah, take that footballer! I’ve got an-
other pair of Chinos!

the crime rate.”
