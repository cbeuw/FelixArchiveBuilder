The men’s team fought through sun,
wind and rain to crush Brighton 10-0.
The afternoon started with the dou-
bles. Despite admitting to not being
the greatest of doubles players, both
Imperial pairs came through strongly
against their opponents.
Our first pair consisting of skipper
Pio, and Frenchman Pierre, had a close
match. Even at 7-7, the Imperial boys
kicked up a gear to take the match 9-7.
Second pair Avinash and fresher Adam
made quick work of their opponents to
win 8-4. A special mention must go
to Avinash whose volleys during the
match would have put Pistol Pete’s (i.e.
Sampras) to shame.
For the first time this season, the
Imperial lads were 2-0 up before the
singles started – a position which they
will hopefully be familiar with by the
end of the season. Adam and Avinash,

playing at 3 and 4 won comfortably, 6-0
6-0 and 6-0 6-1 respectively.
Our esteemed captain Pio (playing at
1) was back in form taking the first set
6-2 and at 5-3, 40-0 up in the second,
victory seemed inevitable. However, a
good passage of play from his Brighton
opponent, and missing a volley that he
could have made in his sleep, put the
score back to 5-5. He quickly bounced
back to take the match in style 6-2, 7-5.
Pierre had a tough singles, the
Frenchman struggled to break down
his very classy opponent in the 1st set,
losing it 5-7. However, a short rain
delay at 1-1 in the second set allowed
Pierre to regroup and reconsider his
game plan.
Once the clouds had passed, Pierre
jumped back onto the court to take the
following 2 sets 6-2 and 6-3.

Last weekend marked the start of the
Handball Division 2 and also the first
time Imperial College has ever been
represented in a national Handball
League.
Thanks to the coaching support from
Marc Fayemi, captain of our partner
team, we had the opportunity to play
a test match against some very experi-
enced Handball players on Friday and
get some last-minute advice
Despite the fact that we were only 14
hours away from the start of the first
League game, we managed to tackle
the difficult issue of playing with two
line players and worked hard on our
defence.
Motivated by our good performance
the day before, the Imperial Eagles
ventured to Leyton to face Warwick
University for the second time, after
beating them to 5th place in last year’s
University Championships.
The game started off rather slowly,
but after a few hesitations in attack
