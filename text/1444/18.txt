S
trolling down Exhibition
Road the other day I had a
rather strange experience.
Now I was in quite a bad
mood after forgetting to top
up my Oyster Card again and being
forced to take the tube. To relax myself
I played some Arcade Fire on my ipod
and suddenly I was transported into
another dimension - that of film.
Yes it sounds ridiculous but I actu-
ally imagined that I was a character
in a low-budget indie drama. Vari-
ous depressing scenarios started to
flow around my head; a close friend
or relative had died and I was looking
for answers amongst the mean streets
of South Kensington or I was search-
ing for my junky biological father after
learning I was adopted - all backed up
by the sombre tones of Arcade Fire.
I know I have a strange mind at times
and it can be perhaps a bit too creative
but I’m sure you’ve all had similar ex-
periences. Maybe you’re sitting on a
bus in the rain with your earphones in
and then a sad song comes on and you
find your head slowly turning to stare
out of the window in despair. It’s not
that you’re genuinely upset, it’s just
sometimes your brain unconsciously
constructs fabricated surroundings in
a reaction to the music you’re listening
to.
I decided to experiment with this ef-
fect. I put on some Arctic Monkeys,
the music of my homeland (Yorkshire).
Nothing in my behaviour changed
apart from my accent which has the
habit of acclimatising when I’m around
other northerners. However The Prod-
igy had me itching for some violence in
a typical footy hooliganism film. Next
Bobby Dylan placed me on an open
road in the American Mid-West trav-
elling in no particular direction.
I was really enjoying myself so I tried
some iconic music from famous films.
The Rolling Stones Jumpin’ Jack Flash
did not turn me into Robert de Niro as
I had hoped but Iggy Pop’s Lust for Life
did put me in the mood for some shop-
lifting and being chased down King
Street by police. Unfortunately Wagn-
er’s Ride of the Valkyries only remind-
ed me how annoyed I get when an-
other lazy advert parodies Apocalypse
Now (British Gas are the culprits this
time). Finally I dared to walk through
Hammersmith late at night with the
28 Days Later soundtrack in my ears. I
must admit, it did freak me out slightly.
I suppose I’m trying to highlight how
important music is to a film, imagine
Jaws, Psycho and The Great Escape
without their fantastic tunes? Anyway
enough of my rambling, this week I’ve
slaved over a French themed special
film section. We are extremely lucky to
have Ciné lumière just around corner
so read the article and then hurry your
bums down to fill their seats!
The Ten Best French Films
Les Quatres cent coups (the 400
blows). Usually mis-translated the ti-
tle actually means ‘raising merry hell’.
Truffaut’s ode to youth is a semi au-
tobiographical account following the
rebellious Antoine as he tries to break
from the rules of society. The famous
ending will leave you in a pensieve
mood for weeks.
Amelie; the French film that everyone
has seen. It’s a joy to watch of course
and Audrey Tatou shines as the self-
less protagonist who learns to find love
in the city full of it.
La Haine. Hate fuelled troubles in the
other side of Paris as suburban youths
look for revenge against violent police.
The Taxi Driver of French cinema, La
Haine is shot in stylish black and white
and always holds your attention. Did
you see the cow?
Jean Claude taught me this hold
Delicatessen. Post-nuclear apocalyp-
tic France involves the surreal tale of
black market human meat, militant
vegetarians, saw playing clowns and
patched up condoms. Pure genius
from Jeunet and Caro (Amelie)
That’s going to make quite a headache
Au Revoir les Enfants. One of the
few films that has brought me to tears.
Students at a boarding school run by
monks in Vichy France are puzzled by
the arrival of three new curly haired
students who don’t take communion.
A lot of life lessons to be learnt and the
most harrowing ending of a film ever.
Les Visiteurs. The best French com-
edy ever. Two knights find themeselves
out of the depth after been transported
to modern times by a witch. Their first
experience with a car tops anything
Basil Fawlty could do.
Should I be scared or laugh?
Jean de Florette/Manon des Sourc-
es. Bonjour Monsieur Depardieu! Set
in rural Provence, these gentle tales
of greed and revenge are some of the
most beautiful films ever committed to
celluloid.
The Choir. Mixed critical reception,
I loved it. A new master at a borstal
slowly wins over the troubled boys
through the power of singing. Think
Goodbye Mr. Chips en français!
Belle de Jour. Bored young house-
wife becomes prostitute to suffice her
needs and fantasies. Sounds like your
contemporary gritty drama. This film
was released in 1967 by the legendary
Luis Buñuel and is probably the sexi-
est film ever made (Come, on this is a
French film list!)
Sexy non?
Breathless. French cinema at its most
brilliant, pretentious best.
Godard’s breakout is a love affair to
cinema with all the classic conventions
of French New Wave in this pseudo
Noir story. Ignore the plot, this is how
films should be made; pure auteur
theory.

Programme:
Memory, A season of European documentaries
M
emory celebrates the
wealth and diver-
sity of contemporary
documentary films
in Europe. The festi-
val runs for six days (15-21 November),
and is now in its third year. It will show-
case the work of new and established
directors from across the continent.
Communism and its fall is a strong
theme in the festival. Children of the
Decree is a chilling look at the Romani-
an dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his
enforcement of the infamous Decree
770, which banned birth control and
abortion.
Other highlights include Up! No-
vember 1989, followed by a panel dis-
cussion which brings together the key
representatives of the November revo-
lutionary forces. To mark the 20th anni-
versary of the Velvet Revolution, there
will be three shorts forming a screening
entitled Close. For those seeking a look
at the history of feminism the docu-
mentary Et ELLE créa la femme offers
a fascinating insight through the French
magazine ELLE.
Memory is running at the Ciné lu-
mière (read the article on Page 19 for

Jennifer’s Body, the latest film to star
FHM’s “sexiest woman in the world”
Megan Fox, is a horror comedy about
a high school cheerleader turned can-
nibal demon. No, seriously.
Fox shot to fame playing the improb-
ably hot love interest of ‘that guy from
Even Stevens’ Shia LaBeouf, in the
summer blockbuster pap, Transform-
ers. Fox’s newest role sees her playing
Jennifer, the most popular girl in high
school who, after an unfortunate inci-
dent, becomes inhabited by the soul of
a demon and in order to sustain herself
in her new demon infected state must
track down and feed on men.
The whole film seems confused
as to what exactly it’s trying to be, it
flitters between angsty teen drama,
lightweight horror and situation com-
edy. What emerges is a film that does
nothing particularly well. Some scenes
in the film stick out jarringly. You can
almost hear the cogs working in the
minds of the cynical movie moguls as
you watch Fox swim naked, and have
a lesbian kiss, for seemingly no other
reason than appeasing male viewers.
After all, we all know demons are re-
nowned for their liking of skinny dip-
ping and sexual experimentation.
But then it’s obvious why this film
was made. It was never going to push
the boundaries of modern cinema. But
what confuses me is why Megan Fox,
after gaining huge success in Trans-
formers, and now presumably able to
pick pretty much whichever role she
wants, chose this as her next part. But,
bad career decisions aside, Jennifer’s
Body is a film which is probably best
avoided. However if you’ve been look-
ing for an excuse to stare at Megan Fox
for two hours without feeling guilty
afterwards, this may just be the film
you’ve been waiting for.
