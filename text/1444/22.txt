W
hy am I bothering
to write this. You’re
all playing Modern
Warfare 2. You’re
not reading this.
You probably even bought a copy and
left it open at the games pages next to
you as you play, just to symbolically
underline the degree to which you’re
not reading this. You bastard. Howev-
er, while you’re feverishly not reading
this on Friday night, I’ll be equally fer-
vently not caring either, because this
week I bought Torchlight.
And man, is it good. It aggravates all
my RSI problems like no other game, but
I cannot stop playing it. It’s a beautiful
effort to create a “Diablo 2.5”
, a 3D ver-
sion of the ultimate RPG hacker, with a
modern take on it and a good few years
of reflection on the design. The manage-
ment side of things, with inventories and
optimisation, is streamlined beautifully.
The world is more alive, thanks to a solid
graphics engine and more interaction
with the landscape - hordes of spiders pil-
ing out of concealed mineshafts or caves,
the kind of dyamism you just don’t get in
traditional isometric hack and slash af-
fairs. And above all else, the drip-feed of
points, improvements and areas is tuned
to perfection. I went on for half an hour
the other night. I emerged three hours
later.
But enough of my complete inability to
control my own schedule. The point is,
you either decided to buy Modern War-
fare 2 despite the string of PR cockups, or
you didn’t. Chances are you did. Games,
like almost every other entertainment
product, tend to avoid boycotts excep-
tionally well, because for all the interest
that is generated about the development
process, the people involved, the impact,
the inspiration and so on, what people are
here for is an experience. Whether that
experience came off the back of a homo-
phobic advertising campaign, whether
that experience is being sold on a date
that makes it slightly distasteful, whether
that experience is provided by the most
hilariously incompetent and PR-inept
community team ever, the experience is
the experience, and as long as that hasn’t
changed it’s still worth looking at.
It’s been a bad month for Infinity Ward,
from the first announcement that they
were dropping dedicated servers right
up until the last announcements about
smaller matches online and controversy
over advertising. But it’s all over now, and
finally you’re now able to judge what they
actually produced. Ignoring the business
side, the media side, you now have the
game. And it’s probably best just to stop
writing this, and leave you to it.
Before I go, though - we’re lining up a
whole bunch of exciting stuff for the De-
cember issues - if there’s a game you want
us to cover, a developer you want us to
talk to, or something you just think we
need to see right now, we’d love to hear
what you want to see, so email us at the
address at the top.

Ten Long Years - 2004
D
amn, if this year isn’t a
big one. Let’s get crack-
ing straight away. Half-
Life 2. Talk.
“Not an incredible
game, but a pretty major step forward
for FPS’.”
Oh. Anyone else?
“Yeah, it has real cinematic quality
but isn’t a classic game. I enjoyed my
first play-through, but ultimately it’s
all a bit underwhelming, especially the
gun-play.”
Right.
“I really hated HL2 when I first
played it.”
Alright, you miserable bastards. Not
a single one of you really came out
strong for one of the big hits of the
year 2004, but while that was surpris-
ing, you still had a wide range of likes.
“Ninja Gaiden was, and is, utterly
badass. This was the first console game
to really push me, and I loved it for it.
Ninja Gaiden gave me challenge, and
when I got past a particularly hard bit
I felt like the KING OF THE WORLD.”
Big changes in the console world
set this year up to be the beginning of
the resurgent Nintendo. The DS was
released this year to great celebra-
tion, and alongside this came the an-
God,you’reamiserablebunch,eh?Rollon2004-theyearofthehatred
nouncement of the Revolu-
tion, the console that
would eventually be-
come the Wii. Oth-
er than that, the
Gamecube didn’t
have that excit-
ing a year - Twin
Snakes came back to
Nintendo at last, but
the real gems were in
the future.
No, this was the year for the con-
soles. Killzone and Halo 2 make up
the exclusive headlines for the year
for both PlayStation2 and XBox, with
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas prov-
ing equally popular once it hit.
On the PC, things didn’t look so
great. “Year of the Ill-Received Se-
quel.” Colt tells us, “Invisible War,
Deadly Shadows and Doom 3.”
While it’s true that Deus Ex 2 : Invis-
ible War and Doom 3 were both criti-
cised on release, Thief 3 has quite the
following over here, it seems.
“Worthy of the Thief name. It re-
ally is brilliant and is only just pipped
by Thief 2. It was quite surprising
how good it was actually.” Karan tells
us, while another reader said: “Thief:
Deadly Shadows. Even though it lost
the number (in an effort to attract new
audiences on Xbox primarily), it was
still a worthy sequel. And it looked gor-
geous. It was basically shadow porn.”
We lost Acclaim this year as they
declared bankruptcy. It’s really a year
of transitions - the last-gen was dy-
ing off. Think of a game that reminds
you of being young - from Crazy Taxi
to the old Turok games - and Acclaim
probably had a hand in it. With their
death, and the rise of the big, clever
and future-looking games, things real-
ly changed in 2004. Rome: Total War
seems to be a good example.
“A great game. The Rome campaign
map made me involved like I’d never
been with Medieval and the AI’s pro-
pensity for sending armies to face you
at bridges meant that I got pretty at-
tached to specific battlefields. And the
screaming women and burning pigs
and head hurlers and war dogs were
amazing.”
This is also the year, as many will
know, that World Of Warcraft
launched. From there ‘til today, gam-
ing has never really been the same. The
MMO formula was finally cracked, co-
inciding with a burst of new technol-
ogy that meant WoW could offer an
experience that gamers had never had
before.
Not everyone likes it, but it’s hard to
deny its era-defining quality. It’s a stan-
dout game of the decade, perhaps not
for gameplay but for concept.
So, a good year for gaming, but not
for games? Feel confused.
In Pictures - The Week In News: EA feel the squeeze; wide variety of other stories
Modern Warfare 2 Released
That game that’s the sequel to another game that was alright, I guess,
has finally been released. So prepare to read NOTHING BUT MW2
for the next three weeks online.
MW2 Ships
Some game got released this week.
I dunno. A man on the news talked
about it, I guess it sounds pretty fun.
EA Struggling?
EA shed 1500 jobs and have cut ‘the bot-
tom third’ of their games lineup after sales
figures hit.
MW2: is it a game?
Some non-gamers discussed whether
Modern Warfare 2 might be a bad
game because it involves guns and
quotes by Napoleon.
