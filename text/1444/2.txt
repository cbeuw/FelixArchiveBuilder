T
he Dalai Lama
addressed tens
of thousands of
followers in the
town of Tawang,
in Arunachal Pradesh, east-
ern India.
The Tibetan spiritual leader is
on a week-long tour of the re-
gion which has brought accu-
sations from Beijing of his tour being an attempt to undermine Chinese author-
ity in Tibet. Many of the people who attended his lecture, held on a packed polo
ground, had been travelling for days, some even coming from neighbouring
Bhutan, for the chance to be enlightened by the exiled Buddhist.
The location of the Dalai Lama’s speech is itself controversial, because India
and China fought a brief border war over parts of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962,
and the issue has never been resolved. In addition, the Dalai Lama fled from
Tibet via Tawang after the Chinese occupation 50 years ago. The 300 year-old
monastery there is one of the most influential outside of Tibet, and lies close to
the border between India and China.
The world beyond
College walls
By Raphael Houdmont, International Editor
L
eaders from all over the world have gathered in Berlin on Mon-
day for events commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall 20
years ago.
The fall of the wall precipitated the end of communist rule in
Eastern Europe, and two years later in the USSR. The wall was a
symbol of division between the east and the west of Berlin, Germany, and
Europe. Its collapse was surprisingly accidental, as East Germans followed
Hungary’s decision to open its borders, the communist government modified
travel restrictions that imprisoned them and a flood of more than 3 million
people crossed the border, many for the first time.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Berlin, retraced
her steps on the night the wall fell by crossing what used to be the Born-
holmer Strasse checkpoint, the first to open 20 years ago. She was joined
by other European leaders and former leaders, including ex-Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, former Polish President Lech Walesa, and Russian Presi-
dent Dmitry Medvedev, who all held speeches for the event.

T
he navies from
both countries
have reported
that some vessels
briefly exchanged
fire at the border.
South Korean officials in
Seoul explained that the inci-
dent began after a North Ko-
rean patrol boat crossed the
western sea border, but the North Korean navy has countered that it was on
its way towards an unidentified object within its borders, when it was sud-
denly attacked by South Korean ships. The North’s boat “lost no time to deal
a prompt retaliatory blow at the provokers”, after which the South Korean
forces “hastily took to flight to the waters of their side.” Both sides have de-
manded an apology.
The countries have had at least two fatal conflicts at sea within the past
decade, and neither can agree to fix a sea border. Although no casualties were
reported this time, the North Korean vessel was apparently set ablaze before
the South’s fleet took off. The conflict comes just a few days before Barack
Obama’s visit to Asia, including his first to China.

I
mperial College welcomes our
new Deputy Rector, Professor
Stephen Richardson, who began his
new post on Monday of this week.
He is also the Principle of Faculty of En-
gineering and will now assume both roles
at the College.
Having walked within Imperial walls
as an undergraduate, post-graduate and
senior member of the College Faculty,
Professor Richardson is well-qualified
to declare that “Imperial is packed with
great people all the way through, and I’m
looking forward to working with all col-
leagues to set the College’s priorities for
the coming years.” He adds to this, “To
serve as Deputy Rector is a huge honour
and I will work very hard to be worthy of
it, and to advance the academic mission
of this outstanding College.”
Professor Richardson accepted his new
position with gratitude and inspiration,
which far humble his previous 30 years
of work at Imperial. He began his under-
graduate studies at Imperial in Chemical
Engineering, 1969, and went on to com-
plete his PhD in 1975. Once having said
that “engineering is in my blood”, it only
seems natural that Professor Richardson
has gone on to become a leader in his
field of science. His main area of research
led him, together with his colleague, to
develop a computer program which has
since been used in the design of over 200
vessel and pipeline installations for the
production of oil and gas. Within his
own Faculty of Engineering, Professor
Richardson is fondly referred to by the
students as the “machine-gun”, to which
he is attributed as a result of his tendency
to talk bullet-quick whenever enthused
by his ideas.
Sir Roy Anderson, Rector of Imperial,
said, “Stephen is a highly popular senior
academic, who has shown great dedica-
tion to Imperial throughout the more
than 30 years he has worked here. He has
New Deputy Rector appointed
been an outstanding leader within his
department and the Faculty of Engineer-
ing, and I am delighted that the whole
College will now benefit from his skills.”
Professor Richardson aims to present
himself as a role model, claiming “My aim
is to lead by example, so if I expect other
people to do things, I should also do them
myself, in some measure. For example: I
still teach, I do admin, I do consultancy
work and I still conduct some research.
A balanced diet is what you need in this
job.”
The new Deputy Rector has certainly
already spent enough time here at Im-
perial to understand the philosophy
behind what the College does as an
entity, across all of its disciplines. He
maintains a clear ambition for all Impe-
rial students, which is “to see our stu-
dents go on to be CEOs of companies,
school teachers inspiring more kids…”
Evidently speaking from his own expe-
rience, he adds, “Graduates at Imperial
still have the very real opportunity to
make a difference.”
“No, it’s true, it’s actually this big. My pay cheque, I mean. What were you
thinking I meant?”
