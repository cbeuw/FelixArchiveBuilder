that “the team played their best match
of the season and the good work by
our coach Phil Jakeman on doubles
play is really paying off”. He also gave
particular praise to Pierre saying “the
Brighton number 2 was the strongest
player and Pierre played a great match
to come back and win”.
Overall a very satisfying win and let’s
hope they can maintain their winning
form for the rest of the season. Next
week we’re up against UCL 2nds away!
Also, the tennis club has exclusive ac-
cess to tickets for the ATP World Tour

the deadlock with a precise throw
from 9 metres, which sparked more
hope amongst the Eagles. Thanks to
some excellent defending by Romain
Henry and Ivan Prnja, Imperial ex-
tended their lead and looked to be in
for a good result in their Development
League debut. Unfortunately, the team
was unable to make their counter at-
tacks count and with Warwick’s strong
half-wing slowly warming up, firing
a few shots past Imperials seemingly
helpless goalkeeper the half time score
was not in our favour.
After an elaborate analysis of the re-
petitive attacking pattern displayed by
Warwick, we managed to come back
strong after half time. Our top scorer
Kolja Ortmann added a few to his tally
and with Ruben Freytag man marking
the only player that posed a threat to
Stefan Bauer’s goal, the Eagles were in
for the fight.
However, with only one substitute
available in a game that allows unlim-
ited substitutions, it was always going
to be the last minutes, that will decide
on who is going home with the 2 points
on the league table.
Still being 4 goals down with only a
few minutes to go, the Imperial Eagles
had to go all-or-nothing in defence to
force quick turnovers and hope to be
more clinical with their counter at-
tacks, but luck was not on our side.
Despite the very encouraging per-
formances by David Müller-Wiesner
and Michael Capper in their first ever
Handball game, Warwick broke our
defence on a few occasions thereby se-
curing their victory.
In spite of the result, the team can
be very pleased with their overall per-
formance after merely 3 training ses-
sions in the term so far. Plenty of team
spirit has been displayed and some im-
pressive attacking combinations have
been shown and I will look forward to
reporting the teams’ first victory of the
season in the near future.
Tennis coast to
Success
Handball in need of improvement
