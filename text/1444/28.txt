Third annual Imperial IV comes around
With over 88 speakers, the annual Imperial Debating competition kicks off in SAF, with Kin-Hing Lo
L
ast Thursday, in the early
evening, over one hundred
European lovelies (and not-
so-lovelies) invaded the
level 7 common room in the
Biochemistry building.
The shelves at Poundland (a lit-
tle known country somewhere to the
rough side of Glasgow) had been raid-
ed for Halloween decorations, and the
shelves at Lidl for cheap lager.
There was even a ‘large’ pumpkin,
lit by a bicycle light due to that old
chestnut: health and safety regula-
tions. The party was held in collabo-
ration with Kings College Erasmus
club, who managed to send almost 7
members.

T
he Imperial College De-
bating Society has been
hard at work over the
summer to organise the
third annual Glencore Im-
perial College Intervarsity Debating
Competition.
One of the real highlights of debat-
ing is that you have the opportunity
to go to championships all across the
country and to meet students from
other universities who are also inter-
ested in current affairs. I was new to
debating when I joined the club last
year but I was able to enter competi-
tions at Kings, LSE and the University
of Nottingham. Our society has sent a
team to the World championships in
2008 and the European championships
earlier this year.
But playing a role in organising a
competition was very different from
just taking part in one! There was a
huge amount of work to be done... con-
venor Dominic was hard at work over
the summer making room bookings,
contacting our sponsors Glencore for
funding and finding a team of judges
for the competition. Meanwhile, social
secretary Enrico was hard at work or-
ganising a (epic!) social event for the
debaters. Other members of the com-
mittee spent a large amount of time
promoting the event to other socie-
ties – for example by designing pro-
motional material and setting up our
Facebook group.
As the new term began and atten-
tions briefly shifted to Freshers Fair,
everything finally came together and
the big day was here - the Imperial IV
had started as an idea: now it was a
competition.
Debates were conducted in British
Parliamentary style with four prelimi-
nary rounds and a break into the fi-
nals. The overall best speaker for this
tournament was Mr Max Kasriel from
Cambridge University out of 88 speak-
ers. The winning team was Cambridge
A with Mr Sam Block and Mr Har-
ish Natarajan. The teams debated five
topics:
1. This house would force all sitting
representatives who leave their party
to immediately stand for re-election.
2. This house would abolish all libel
and slander laws.
3. This house would break the law to
protect animal rights.
4. This house would ban all
pornography.
5. This house believes that the reli-
gious organisations that suicide bomb-
ers belong to should be punished.
After the extremely close finals of
the competition (judging took well
over an hour!) a social event was held
where much food was consumed and
drink was drunk. The Imperial IV
was one of the first debating events of
the academic year and also one of the
highlights.
The Imperial College Debating So-
ciety has organised public debates on
many high profile current issues. We
exist to promote informed, intelligent
debate in all aspects of human enquiry.
We organise show debates and provide
professional coaching by national de-
baters to members of our society. The
next show debate is on Thursday 19th
November and we will be discussing
environmental policy.
If you would like to find out more
about debating, please come to one of
our weekly meetings on Wednesday
evening 6pm-8pm in the Sir Alexan-
der Fleming Building room 120. You

So how does university debating
work? British parliamentary style is the
most common style of debating at uni-
versity level.
The debate consists of four teams
with two different sides, the proposi-
tion and the opposition. Speeches are
5 minutes long.
Motions are released 15 minutes
before a debate, which means that de-
baters will have to come up with ideas
impromptu without using electronic
references such as the Internet.
magnet Sam ‘Je parle francais avec un
accent essex’ Campaigne, the room
was full by 8pm. Members handed
their paltry £3 to Andrew ‘World
Domination’ Leung and were re-
warded with a free bar and nibbles.
Costumes were worn, ranging from
the shit to the spectacular, and prizes
were given. The stock of 250 beers
and 10 litres of wine was destroyed in
a little over two hours.
Small talk was provided by el presi-
dente, Nora ‘from Norway’ Tand-
berg, face paint by Stuart ‘Hairspray’
Higgins, food by Poundland (again)
and heating by Aga ‘Spelling Bee’
Langner. Later followed the after-
party at Onanon.
Sam, Anthony ‘Dark Horse’ Maina
and Jon ‘Human Dustbin’ Worboys
benevolently escorted the eras-
musites to Picadilly Circus and bo-
ogied the night away. Rumours that
at breakfast time cunning linguist
Anthony was still up and enjoying a
croissant neuf, are pure speculation.
Upcoming events organised by our
event managers Mark ‘Marky Mark’
Smith and Sarah ‘my surname is also
a first name. Which is weird’ Jane
include a fireworks night, a trip to
Oxford and Bath, and a Twin Tigers
night.
If you are a student here on an ex-
change or are going on an exchange
in one of your years here at Imperial,
come along to one of the events we
have planned!
Or you could Join the facebook
group!
