Strike Three!
You’re Outta Here!
Feroz Salam reports as the dark Lord Mandelson pushes for three
strike filesharer disconnection without trial in the UK
Fighting the
good fight
R
upert Murdoch, you know
that old guy who keeps rant-
ing about things that he obvi-
ously doesn’t understand, hit
the headlines this week for his ham-
fisted abuse of Google. Murdoch in-
sists that Google is profiteering off of
stolen News Corp content. What he
seems to not understand is that yes,
Google does make money from search,
and perhaps search including News
Corp articles, but when someone
searches for something in his articles
they end up going to that article on his
website. Surely the fact that they can’t
capitalise on that is their own prob-
lem? Murdoch even went as far as to
say:
‘If they’re just search people.... They
don’t suddenly become loyal readers’
Murdoch wants to make all of News
Corps online content paid for and
make users access it directly. Well for
one, I don’t see that actually working
(would you pay for The Sun online?).
And second of all, if you don’t want
people to be able to search your arti-
cles, then why not block search en-
gine spider access? It’s pretty simple,
you just put a ‘don’t access this’ in the
Robots file on your domain and the
search engine will ignore.
Google itself responded to these ac-
cusations with a statement to the effect
of ‘Whatever man’ telling Mr. Murdo-
ch that all he needs to do is tell Google
to not index his sites and just as easy as
that they’d be removed. What I don’t
think Murdoch understands about all
this is that without Google and other
search engines leading users to the
content, not many are actually going to
find and read the content. OK, a few
dedicated people might read it like a
newspaper, browsing around it, but at
the end of the day News Corp content
for the most part is hardly unique. Peo-
ple will just go somewhere else rather
than pay.
In other search news, Google has

Today I’d like to introduce you to an-
other student friendly free service that
helps you keep your bookmarks, pass-
words and other things in sync across
multiple computers, browsers and
operating systems. Now this doesn’t
sound all that exciting but if you’ve
ever used a college computer and
wished you had access to all the book-
marks and passwords you’ve got stored
on your home machine then Xmarks is
for you.
So what is Xmarks? Well it started as
a plugin for Firefox called Foxmarks,
which simply synced your bookmarks
between Firefox browsers via cloud
storage. Of course Firefox isn’t the
only browser on the planet and so the
company branched out to other brows-
ers and other platforms including In-
ternet Explorer and Safari on OSX
and changed their name to Xmarks.
Google’s Chrome on both OSX and
Windows is also currently supported
in a limited capacity through a new
Xmarks alpha build and the Chrome
dev channel, which leaves only Cami-
no and Opera out of the major market
players unaccounted for.
Xmarks essentially gives you a sync
service for all your bookmarks across
multiple systems and browsers with
one login. Bookmarks are synced
seamlessly as well as logins and pass-
words, if you use Firefox 3, for any and
all sites that your browser happens to
save. The client syncs the data in the
background to the Xmarks servers
with encryption to keep your logins
safe on their servers and across the In-
ternet. When you next logon to a com-
puter Xmarks updates any changes you
happen to have made, allowing you to
continue where you left off, regardless
of which computer or browser you
happen to have in front of you.
If you find yourself in front of a com-
puter that you can’t install the sync
client on then Xmarks also provides
you with a handy online repository of
all your bookmarks. Simply browse to
Xmarks.com, which includes a mobile
optimised site, and login to find all
your bookmarks laid out for you. This
is especially handy if you just want to
show something to someone on their
T
he ethical issues involved in
piracy have been in the news
a lot over the last decade or
so. As the music and film in-
dustries tried to come to terms with an
entirely new distribution format and a
new generation grew up with Limewire
and the Pirate Bay, conflicts sprouted
everywhere as the industries attempt-
ed to strong-arm the file-sharers, only
to be met with stubborn resistance. At
the end of the first decade of the 21st
century, the dust has settled a fair bit.
The Pirate Bay lost their court battle
against the recording industry, several
large torrent trackers were shut down
(with the fate of many more uncertain)
and Limewire (along with all the ad-
ware that is bundled with it) has more
or less been consigned to history.
That said, it appears that the RIAA
and the MPAA aren’t done yet. In a
new piece of legislation that will come
into force in the summer of 2011, per-
sistent filesharers can be blocked from
their internet connections as part of
a “three strikes policy”. This, as the
name suggests, is an American con-
cept that coincidentally has previously
only largely been used on murderers
and rapists, never before on the aver-
age spotty teenager. The implementa-
tion of this law therefore, raises some
interesting questions. Is your average
music thief banned from using the
internet for life? What if he moves
house? What about the people who
move into his old house? Can he work
somewhere with access to internet or
is this an all-encompassing burden he
must carry with him to his grave? Most
importantly, where is he to find quality
Japanese tentacle porn?
The obviously confused man be-
hind this new law, Lord Mandelson,
had shown little interest in piracy and
copyright issues until he flew to Corfu
for a meeting with Dreamworks’ co-
founder David Geffen (Dreamworks
being the studio that churns out me-
diocre animated films that no one has
ever really watched). Immediately af-
ter his small trip, Lord Mandelson saw
it fit to attempt to push this law into
existence, all the while denying the two
events were linked, in the same way
that me setting fire to my carpets and
my house burning down would not be
linked.
Aside from the political aspect of the
law, there’s the issue of innocent users
incorrectly being identified as illegal
filesharers. The ISP TalkTalk, in a re-
cent stunt, showed that roughly 34% of
wireless connections in your average
street have either little or no security at
all. Wireless security hasn’t been able to
keep up with the explosion in wireless
internet; the average user probably has
no idea about the differences between
WPA and WEP, and probably doesn’t
care. To cut these users off from the
internet is rather like permanently ban-
ning a supermarket just because there
was a shootout in their parking lot. It
makes no sense.
Looking at the broader picture, one
has to ask whether such laws are really
required, and whether they add any-
thing in the long term. The meteoric
rise of Spotify has been a testament to
the fact that financially viable free mu-
sic distribution is possible. By pushing
this new law forward as strongly as he
is doing, Mandelson is taking away any
incentive the recording companies have
to innovate and giving filesharers an
incentive to find smarter ways to beat
the system, setting the stage for another
round of long and bloody legal battles.
As we drift along into 2010, it’s worth
recalling a relatively small music shar-
ing service that operated between June
1999 and July 2001, Napster. Facing a
massive set of lawsuits from big name
record labels at the turn of the millen-
nium, Napster declared bankruptcy
and slipped into oblivion. Yet the prac-
tice of filesharing wasn’t affected much
as users simply moved on to different
technologies. 10 years on, it appears
that the film and recording industries
have learnt little, if anything, from the
past – and with laws being drawn up
by politicians who apparently have no
understanding of the underlying issues,
there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight
to the vicious cycle.

bookmarks and passwords.
For students this means that you can
carry your bookmarks for research,
notes, articles and of course YouTube
videos and time wasters (everyone
needs a little break here and there
right?) between home, college and an-
ywhere else. I would have killed for this
kind of service in my 1st year simply
for research, let alone everything else.
The kicker is that it’s totally free, no
catch, no ads, just a great service and
something everyone should be using.
So what you waiting for? Head on
over to www.xmarks.com to register
and get your sync on.
Xmarks the spot for free bookmark and password sync across multiple browsers
finished testing of its new back end
search architecture, nicknamed Goog-
le Caffeinated, and will start rolling it
out across its data centres in the near
future. You won’t notice anything dif-
ferent about the Google search page,
but you might about your searches.
Polls have shown that generally peo-
ple think their searches are better with
Google Caffeinated over regular old
Google. Will your searches be better?
I guess that will depend on your use of
Google, but overall Google Caffeinated
seems like a win for all. Whether you’ll
notice however, is debatable.
One of my favourite programs this
week is going HD. The new series
of Top Gear starts Sunday and is be-
ing broadcast in both SD and HD.
For those with Virgin, Sky or FreeSat
it’ll surely make the rampaging chal-
lenges and beautiful cars even more
visceral. For those stuck with SD TV,
you’ll probably be able to get it in HD
on iPlayer, which shows quite a lot of
programs these days in HD. After all,
almost all programs recorded for TV
are currently shot in HD only to be
converted later to SD with a lot of im-
age processing.
Talking about TV, Channel 4 is run-
ning a 3D week next week with vintage
3D films and shows being shown in all
their glory. Admittedly, the technology
Channel 4 are using to broadcast in
3D isn’t the most up-to-date but free’s
free right? Derren Brown will feature
and there’s also a greatest 3D moments
from TV, film and music videos show.
The highlight of the week, however,
has to be the first ever broadcast of
the Queen’s coronation in 3D, allow-
ing views to step back in time and be
in some small way, a part of it. Now I
don’t know about you but I’m not that
fussed about Derren Brown in 3D, but
the royalist in me is pretty stoked about
Queenie in 3D. Get on over to your near-
est Sainsbury’s to get some funky glasses
to watch C4’s 3D week while stocks last.
