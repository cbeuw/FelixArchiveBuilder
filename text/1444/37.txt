Aunty McPickle says all your problems are real. Oh dear
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I finally met someone who I enjoyed
being on a date with and the evening
went really well. We spent the night
together at his. In the morning he
had to get up for work and left before
I woke up. I had breakfast and then
went to the loo. Of course I had to
do a number 2 and much to my hor-
ror couldn’t get rid of it. I flushed
and flushed. Eventually I resorted to
putting it into a carrier bag to take
with me and then dispose of. I left
a note on the work top to say how
much I had enjoyed the night before
and was looking forward to seeing
him again and hurried out of the
door.
As soon I had shut the front door, I
had a pretty upsetting realisation:
I’d left the carrier bag by the note
on the work top. I now have only 3
hours until he’ll get back. HELP!
Carrie Gab
Dear Carrie,
Ok, you need to act swiftly. Call him
and say that you forgot something at his
house and that you need it desperately.
Then wait outside the door until he gets
back. As soon as he does, run upstairs,
grab the bag and discreetly stuff it in
your pocket. Then rapidly make haste
for the door and try to pass it off as nor-
mally as possible. Hopefully the smell
won’t be too bad. Good luck.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
One of my best friends has a really
embarrassing habit. Whenever he is
pondering something, he scratches
his balls, which makes a flappy wet
sound and then he sniffs his fingers.
I am pretty sure he has noticed my
horrified expression but doesn’t
seem to stop him.
Please help me out as I have no idea
what I should do?
Tess Tickles
Dear Tess,
This does seem to be quite coddy con-
dendrum and which may take some
fishing for a solution. I believe that he
might be sniffing his own smeg, oth-
erwise known as willy cheese. Some
people might associate this smell with
success and it can relieve stress. How
about sniffing his fingers, maybe it just
smells really good. You could give him
an exaggerated look of disgust or just
socially shun him for a while. It might
be nicer to just bring up the next time
It’s an entirely normal solution to a massive turd and a weak-pressured toilet. Pick it up and put it in a bag. You’re not a fucking dog, love! Maybe you are......
he does it but be sure to remain at arms
length.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
Last week me and my girlfriend were
enjoying a cosmical sexual session
and reached for some lubrication.
The room was dark and two tubes
lay at our disposal. One was the
desired KY jelly and the other was
some super glue, left over from my
model plane making kit.
We were soon stuck in a very sticky
situation which involved a humili-
ating trip to A&E and some very
intimate doctor hands. I know have
some of her parts left on me and me
on her. Can it ever be the same?
Louis Ligase
Dear Louis,
This is as cliche as it comes, Louis! I
would have loved to seen the sight of
you two waddling down Fulham Road
to Chelsea & Westminister A&E. It
would be an idea to keep super glue
away from bedroom area, especially
when embarking on the love journey.

Q: What are the two things Imperial stu-
dents love most?
A: Free alcohol and dressing up like
twats! If you answered stochastic dif-
ferential equations and solving Sudoku,
then quit reading and get a life.
This Wednesday, RAG is taking over the
Union, fancy dress style! The theme will
be ANYTHING starting with R, A or G.
All you Rambo, Angel or Gollum etc.
wannabees throw your textbooks aside
and head over to the Union for our
Sports Night! Only £6 will get you un-
limited alcohol until we run out (£8 if
you’re lame and don’t dress up).
As always, ALL profits go to our chosen
charities; it won’t get rid of your head-
ache the next day, but it sure will make
it worth it!
On another note, we still have some
vacant Tube collection permits, so
if you’re interested then pop us an e-
mail at rag@ic.ac.uk..
20 kegs of free alcohol! Intrigued? Well, read on...
