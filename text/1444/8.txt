W
hat happens if
you put a little bit
of yeast in a dish
full of sugar solu-
tion? Any biolo-
gist, or indeed a home brewer or ama-
teur baker, can tell you the answer.
They eat the food, they reproduce,
and they produce waste products
which include CO2 and (if you’re
lucky) alcohol. So far, so good. The
populations of the little yeasty crea-
tures multiplies until they have gorged
themselves silly on all of the sugar, ex-
creting their waste into the dish as they
go.
Unfortunately for the yeast, their lit-
tle utopia stops somewhat nastily just
on the brink of a population explosion
(and no doubt all sorts of yeasty art,
your-mum jokes and search for extra-
dish-intelligence) because at some
point they will either run out of food
or poison themselves with their own
waste products.
This is why you have to distil alco-
holic drinks to get them up much be-
yond a few percent.
A similar situation applies to our-
selves. The human species feed on
an underground source of calories,
which BP, Exxon and the like are only
too happy to sell to us in a million dif-
ferent forms to keep us happy. Trans-
port, heating electricity, clothing,
medicine, agriculture and almost all
aspects of our modern civilisation are
dependent on these cheap fossil fuel
calories to keep the economy grow-
ing. We burn it, releasing the energy
of ancient sunlight, and discharge
the waste product, CO2, into the
atmosphere.
Luckily for us, CO2 isn’t toxic in it-
self, but it is poisoning the atmospheric
energy balance, and disrupting climate
systems such as the Asian Monsoon
that we rely on to maintain agricultural
conditions optimal for our food supply.
We are also on the brink of an energy
supply precipice. The easy-to-get-
at oil, on which we rely, is being used
up. New discoveries of oil peaked in
1964, and it is likely that supplies will
start to decline within the next few
years. Population, meanwhile, contin-
ues to increase.
Let’s hope that we have the foresight
to recognise, accept, and do something
about these problems. Unlike yeast.

“Unfortunately

T
he Internet has done
many things in its brief
forty years on this planet.
But for something whose
first act was to allow sci-
entists to share jokes with each other
from the comfort of their offices, its
done surprisingly little for getting peo-
ple to realise how sad they are.
Last year I did a little tour of the
BBC’s online “Have Your Say” website,
highlighting the multitude of sand-
wichless picnics that spend their days
tapping away on their keyboards like
an infinite number of lobotomised
monkeys. They’re still funny now, not
because what they’re saying is dumb
– although it really is – but because
these people have no idea what they’re
saying. It takes a special kind of stupid
to sit down in front of a system that
connects billions of other members
of their species and not take a quick
looky-loo to see if everyone else is as
hare-brained as they are.
I only bring this up because last
week’s article by the delightful Mariash
was one of those articles that makes
me sit back and wonder whether peo-
ple ever stop talking for long enough
for their brain to finish checking it
for sense. It’s like there’s a little civil
servant sitting up there in their skull,
watching a live broadcast of what their
human is saying, frantically trying to
get through to the press on the mobile
telling them not to publish any of it. In
case you didn’t read it – and why would
you, we only publish felix to pass the
time – Ms. Mariash’s article bemoaned
the state of sexuality at Imperial. And
that’s fair enough, because a lot of the
first years do spend their days stagger-
ing around in half-on, half-off clothes
with a look in their eyes like a walrus
in heat. Then again, the first years are
still teenagers, and you’re at univer-
sity. Explain to me which bit of this is
surprising.
Anyway, bizarrely obvious assertions
aside, the bit that really gets me is the
hyperbole. It’s as if everyone she’s met
so far at Imperial tried to shag various
appendages off her within sixty sec-
onds of meeting her, as if her entire
life is one of those Japanese hidden-
camera gameshows, ‘Normal Workday
Rapist Surprise’ or something. I mean,
I know that generalisations are part
and parcel of writing comment pieces
because I’m as guilty as anyone, but
let’s at least make them vaguely rea-
sonable. It’s not like you’re a bastion
of romance, standing ironically erect
among a field of disease-ridden copu-
lating youngsters, a single tear rolling
down your cheek and falling onto the
rose you hold in your hand.
Romance is no more dead than tee-
totalling, helping old ladies across the
street or not reading the Daily Mail.
Just because fewer people are doing it
the way you want it done doesn’t mean
you get to forge a soapbox out of un-
used Valentine’s Day cards and declare
yourself the last of the Queen’s Tower
Hand-Holding Society.
I’m really happy that you folk are get-
ting the keyboards dusted off and writ-
ing for the comment section, but I’m
fairly sure I’m not alone in being of the
opinion that a few of you aren’t tapping
your sanity barometers as you walk past
each morning to check if they’re swing-
ing to “Away With The Electric Booga-
loo Fairies”
. The great thing about free
speech is that it’s a right, but not an ob-
ligation. You can say anything you want.
But you really, really don’t have to. Hon-
estly. So many more things you could be
doing. Like getting drunk or having sex
with strangers.
Ijest.Idothinkit’skindofsadthatpeo-
ple like Mariash still feel the need to de-
clare their virginity, their sensible drink-
ing, their desire for true love. Because
what it means is that the people making
all the noise are the small proportion of
idiots trying to rut anything with a cav-
ity at crotch height. Thing is, Mariash,
the solution to this isn’t for you to write
in felix how the entire world is conspir-
ing to get you into a sex education class.
All that does is make your stance look
sillier. And then someone’s going to get
depressed about how awful my gram-
mar is, go and drink their sorrows away;
you’re just feeding the system Mariash.
You’re part of the problem. So go and
talk to people, find others like you.
