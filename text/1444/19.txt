Welcome to the Ciné lumière: French film heaven
O
k, so you think you’ve
found all your local cin-
emas; the rip off Odeon
on High Street Ken, the
slightly less dear Cine-
world on Fulham Road and even the
Electric Cinema in Notting Hill. But if
I were to tell you that the nearest cin-
ema to college was just down road you
would probably look at me blankly (not
necessarily in disbelief!). Let me intro-
duce you to the Ciné lumière, your
most accessible location to keep up on
World and European cinema.
Ciné lumière is based at the Institut
français du Royaume-Uni in South
Kensington which is the official French
government centre for language and
culture in the UK. It is one of 150 In-
stitutes worldwide and one of the
oldest. Beyond its primary mission
to promote French language and cul-
ture, the Institut is also committed to
encouraging cross-cultural exchange,
and to the promotion of European and
World culture. Comprising a language
centre, multimedia library and a cin-
ema, it welcomes thousands of people
each year.
Recently refurbished and reopened
by Catherine Deneuve in January 2009,
Ciné lumière, the Institut’s cinema, has
established itself as one of London’s
top repertory cinemas. With a particu-
lar emphasis on French, European and
World cinema, its programme com-
bines new releases, repertory screen-
ings, previews and exclusive on-stage
events attended by directors and ac-
tors. Recent guests include François
Ozon, Sophie Marceau, Jude Law, Ber-
trand Tavernier, Mathieu Amalric and
Patrice Chéreau. Among the annual
festivals it programmes or hosts are
the French Film Festival, Spanish Film
Festival, London Film Festival and the
Mosaïques Festival of World Culture.
Ciné lumière enjoys a well-earned
reputation as one of the best places
in London to see French film. Thanks
to this reputation, it is able to attract
some of France’s top acting and direct-
ing talent for on-stage debates and
masterclasses; recent guests include
Claire Denis, Christophe Honoré, Ro-
main Duris, Sophie Marceau, Mathieu
Amalric, Fanny Ardant and Jean-Pierre
Bacri. It is also the cinema of choice
for UK distributors previewing new
French releases: The Beat That My
Heart Skipped, Couscous, The Diving
Bell and the Butterfly, La vie en rose,
Female Agents and more have all pre-
viewed at Ciné lumière in recent years.
The cinema screens all the best new
French releases, but is also known
for its carefully curated seasons of
classic French cinema on particular
themes (Paris at the Movies, French
avant-garde cinema of the 20s and
30s, French cinema under the Occu-
pation) or devoted to particular actors
or directors (Truffaut, Godard, Claire
Denis, Jacques Demy). Ciné lumière
also champions the work of directors
such as Marguerite Duras and Alain
Robbe-Grillet whose films are rarely
shown on London screens, and regu-
larly organises special screenings of
new French films without UK distribu-
tion deals.
Though its programming naturally
reflects a French and francophone
bias, Ciné lumière also supports Euro-
pean and World cinema, and is part of
the Europa Cinemas Network. It works
with a variety of outside partners, es-
pecially other European cultural insti-
tutes in London, on seasons celebrat-
ing other national cinemas (Armenian,
German, Romanian), or retrospectives
of non-French actors and directors
such as Pier-Paolo Pasolini, Werner
Herzog, and Marcello Mastroianni. In
recent years the cinema has welcomed
such distinguished guests as Francesco
Rosi, Abbas Kiarostami, Julian Schna-
bel, Alexi Gherman, Otar Iosseliani
and Pedro Costa; its spring Mosaïques
Festival of World Culture and the
London Spanish Film Festival in Sep-
tember have become popular annual
events and are especially significant
in that they give screen space to films
which would not otherwise be shown
in the UK.
So there you go, a fantastic cinema
with great films you may never have
the opportunity to see elsewhere in
London and it’s just on our doorstep!
There are many film festivals taking
place soon including the French Film
Festival and the European Documen-
tary Festival which are featured in this
week issues. So if you’re feeling adven-
turous one day, pop in to the Ciné lu-
mière and you might find a gem.
French Film Festival UK: la crême du cinema français
At Ciné Lumière, London, 11 November - 6 December 2009
C
iné lumière will be the
London host for the 17th
edition of the French Film
Festival UK from 11 No-
vember to 6 December.
The festival showcases the best of con-
temporary French cinema from estab-
lished auteurs to new talents, and this
year will feature tributes to two legen-
dary figures: Jacques Tati and Jean Eus-
tache. Central to the festival are several
monumental biopics, notably Sagan,
Tabarly, and Séraphine.
Highlights of the festival include
the preview screenings of Jacques
Audiard’s Cannes Grand Prix winner
A Prophet (now France’s contender
for best foreign language film Oscar)
and the seven César award winner
Séraphine.
Director Pierre Marcel will be at-
tending the festival to present his doc-
umentary Tabarly about Gallic master
mariner Eric Tabarly who finally was
lost at sea en route to Fife Regatta.
The Totally Tati season will celebrate
the genius of the film-maker and ac-
tor who reinvented the art of slapstick
comedy and through his Mr Hulot
character found the perfect foil for his
musings on humanity in the face of
consumerism and mechanisation. The
retrospective includes a newly restored
digital print of the classic Mr Hulot’s
Holiday.
Jean Eustache’s outstanding achieve-
ment was his 1973 feature, The Mother
and the Whore. Here his early works
are presented.
