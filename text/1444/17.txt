Band Bio
Hailing from Denmark, Alphabeat
provide quirky, upbeat, dance
pop at its very best. Heavily
influenced by the 90’s pop scene,
their forthcoming album The Spell
strives to recreate that feel good
vibe. The track Fascination, from
their first album This is Alphabeat
reached number 6 in the UK chart
last year.
S: Stine Bramsen Simonsen (Lead
vocals)
R: Rasmus Nikolai Nagel Nielsen
(keyboards)
D
anish pop-stars Alpha-
beat reveal a love of a rye
bread rider and how it is
impossible to be a pop-
star in Denmark... Stuart
Higgins interviews lead singer Stine
and keyboard player Rasmus before
their last gig at the end of their current
UK tour.
Alphabeat is quite an unusual name,
where did it come from?
S: It was our bass player, Andreas R.
We were playing around with words
and liked the alphabet and the visu-
als it brought to mind. The whole
children’s way of looking at the alpha-
bet, it’s quite colourful. And then we
thought of Alphabet Street by Prince,
played around with the word and it be-
came Alphabeat.
How did you guys get to know each
other, were you friends beforehand?
R: It was our singer Anders SG and
drummer Troels who started things
off and got together. And Troels knew
Anders and Anders... (There are three
Anders).
That must be quite confusing?
R : Yeah! And that was about 8-9 years
ago, and then Stine and I joined about
a year later, so we’ve been Alphabeat
together for about 7-8 years now. It
was formed from early high school.
How do you write songs? Does it be-
gin with a particular melody or lyric?
S: That’s actually very different this
time round. For the old album it was
mainly our guitarist Anders B who
wrote most of our songs, and we would
finish them off in the rehearsal space.
R: We’d then go directly into the stu-
dio. But this time round we’ve been
writing and producing at the same
time in our home studio.
S: So the forming of sound and song
is entwined into one. The new album
sounds more synthetic, one hundred
percent pop this time.
Your new single The Spell has just
been released in the UK. What’s it
about?
S: It’s a love song, like most of our
songs. We like classic lyrics about love,
and like the title suggests, you’re sup-
posed to be under a spell – something
universal that everyone can relate too.
And then, it’s of course inspired by
early 90s pop...
R: ...artists such as Black Box, and the
track Get Serious by Cut and Move.
We were definitely influenced by the
whole house piano thing.
S: Anders SG wrote it and is debuting
as a singer songwriter type, which is
cool. We also tried to put a bit more
modern pop into the album. We love
Britney and Rhianna, all of that Ameri-
can pop.
What are the differences between
playing a gig in Denmark or the UK?
S: In general the fan culture is very
different. In Denmark you can’t really
be a popstar, you can’t really idolise
anyone because it’s such a small coun-
try. No matter how famous a person
is, you’ll always know someone who
knows them, there’s always a link. So
you’re not really impressed, or at least
you’re not supposed to be. It’s fun to
experience the celebrity vibe over here,
there’s much more screaming.
Do you have any riders or rituals
for gigs? I can’t see any champagne
around here.
S: No, we have quite a boring rider
really.
R: Yeah, we’ve just added Rye bread to
Alphabeat Interview @ Heaven
it, just to feel a bit... Danish.
S: We have a little thing that we do be-
fore we go on stage, but I’m not sure
if it’s a secret or not. Did we ever tell
anyone?
R: No, I actually think it’s kind of a
secret.
S: We have a little séance.
R: For like a minute...
S: But we can’t go into detail...
Has anything unusual or crazy ever
happened at one of your gigs?
R: We were playing at V-Festival this
year and Amy Winehouse was there on
stage, and Pete Doherty.
S: They sat on the stage watching our
whole show, and then afterwards Pete
said he’d really enjoyed the gig to our
bass player. It was kind of weird - it was
the last person you’d expect to compli-
ment us.
If you heard Alphabeat on the radio,
would you sing along?
S: No, I wouldn’t.
R: Actually, when I heard The Spell
come on the radio for the first time, I
did turn the volume up.
S: Oh yeah of course, the first time you
hear it come on the radio - that was an
amazing feeling. But you only put the
record on when you’re in the process
of making it. You keep listening to it
every day.
Say you were to meet someone at-
tractive, what would be a bigger turn
on, if they said they were a physicist
or a medic?
S: Medicine
R: Yeah medicine!
Oh god, no! No! Wrong answer!
Here are some quick fire questions:
London or Copenhagen?
R&S: London
Coffee or tea?
R: Coffee S:Tea
Face2Face
Stuart Higgins speaks with the Danish invaders of the pop scene
Meaning of life in one word?
R: Enjoyment S: Love
Best song ever?
R: Whitney Houston, all of them.
S: I want to dance with somebody,
that’s probably the best sing ever.
Bill or Ben?
R&S: Ben
Sunshine or Snow?
R: Snow S: Sunshine
Favourite Mood?
R: Really happy S:Excited/
fascinated
Abba or Ace of Base:
R&S: Ace of Base
Physicist or Medic, just to be sure...
R: Medic
Are you sure?
R: Yes
S: Hmmm... no wait – it depends who
I’m talking to.
That’s better, but still not perfect...
Where would you like Alphabeat to
be in one year’s time?
R: We would definitely like to go to the
States at some point, if that’s possible.
Or just carrying on playing gigs, hope-
fully sold out - having a good time.
S: Our new album will be out early
next year, and we’re just hoping that it
goes really well. I feel really good about
it and we’re quite proud of what we’ve
done and hope people get it.
Alphabeat’s new single The Spell is out
now, to be followed up by their new al-
bum early next year.
