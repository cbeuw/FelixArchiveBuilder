Albums that you
should know
Hugh Crail looks at modern classics that
shaped music today
Q
magazine, the self-ap-
plauding, Oasis obsessed,
Bono baiting UK music
publication called this al-
bum “A hideous mess of electro noo-
dling and maddeningly obtuse, tune-
less vocals.” And they are perfectly
correct; to the same crowd who bought
Razorlight’s second album on their 5/5
recommendation, this album should
make no sense.
The brother-sister duo, the Knife
garnered an international reputation
shortly before the release of this, their
third full-length album, from a cover
of their song “Heartbeats” by Jose
Gonzales that featured on a prime time
TV advert. But instead of responding
to this new found acclaim like most
artists do, they decided to use their
new found stage to show a more sub-
tle, introspective vision of their music.
They had previously gained moder-
ate success in their homeland Sweden
by producing typically Scandinavian
eccentric pop music, but their cheesy
beats became masterfully intricate
electro, combining the simplistic
synths of Kraftwerk with rotating
Aphex Twin drums. From the robotic
bass drums of the intro of ‘Silent Shout’
they create a sparse sound that is built
on with restrained precision to form a
sound that is as equally unsettling as it
is playful. The pitch-shifted vocals cre-
ate a choir of different personalities,
with Karin Dreijer Andersson singing
all the parts as if it were a one-woman
play. Her lyrics seem to touch on eve-
ryday life, but a life bent until breaking
point to fit her dark imaginary reality.
Unlike many recent critically ac-
claimed albums, the songs stand in-
dividually. ‘We Share our Mother’s
Health’ is a single that is almost per-
fect, adding an urgency and simplicity
that makes it danceable and likeable
from the first listen. The synth refrain
itself has an uncanny ability to grasp
your attention after every listen.
The Knife is currently on hiatus, with
Karin Dreijer Andersson releasing her
solo album ‘Fever Ray’, which explores
domestic psychosis. Her brother has
just finished writing an electronic op-
era about the theory of evolution for
Darwin’s birthday. No matter what
the readers of Q would like to think,
the Andersson siblings have more sig-
nificance than the Gallagher’s have had
in the last 10 years with their rotting
corpse of a band.
Reviews
Not unlike the brooding MGMT with
its psychedelic industrial drones; if you
like new wave, it’s likely this band will
be right up your alley. ‘Bugs On Glue’
sounds like the clangers sitting in a
jacuzzi having an argument with a ka-
zoo and a vauum cleaner before kick-
ing into cool-as synthpop. The drums
and synth will march and pull you
through each track respectedly, this
really is ‘close your eyes, nod your head
and lose yourself in the music’ music.
- Tom Jennings
“The Fame Monster” and self-pro-
claimed rock star Lady Gaga presents
her latest offering in the name of mu-
sic, performance art, fashion and just
plain kookiness. Her new song “Bad
Romance” features everything from
Baroque harpsichord and distorted
strings (no doubt coming from her
classical piano training) to throaty
consonants bellowed in the form of
‘Roma!’ in homage to her native land’s
capital. It’s a dance track like all of her
others, the opening lines being as ec-
centric as always– “I want your ugly, I
want your disease”. It then builds up to
a chorus that somehow anticlimaxes
in its unfittingly mainstream, “nor-
mal” style. Nevertheless, it has a catchy
chorus and is effective in its purpose.
It’s sure to say that it will engage many
in an absent-minded humming of its
melody upon release. One might even
notice the 3 lines of French if they lis-
ten carefully. - Joanna Cai
LADY GAGA
BAD ROMANCE
POLYDOR
SINGLE Warning! This music contains soft edg-
es! The floating melodies with minimal
accompaniment make it ideal back-
ground music to listen to while con-
centrating on all the studying you said
you would do... Even songs that show
a little bit more urgency like ‘Danger
Pins’ have an ethereal dreamlike qual-
ity that seems to charm you and make
you want to sigh at their loveliness. ‘I
Shot The Mayor, Not the Deputy’ is a
personal favouite and this album de-
serves a soothing 2:1. - Tom Jennings

t’s difficult to write an informed
review of Ghanan afrobeat if
you’ve spent your entire life in
the home counties listening to
alternative rock. That said it sounds
so familliar to me, yet so different. It
appears to be based around early 70’s
funk and r n’ b music but translated
to fit to the complex cross rythms of
traditional african drumming. Fa-
mously adopted by Paul Simon in the
80’s, it’s very relavant to modern mu-
sic and seems to be about to take over.
Already having been adopted by rock
bands like TV on the Radio, Vampire
Weekend and Foals, it’s making in-
droads into hip hop, being champi-
oned by up and coming rappers like
Wale and K’Naan. The effect of this
music is mesmerising, every song on
this 2 disc compilation will make you
wanna get up and dance, but you won’t
know how– what’s more fun than that?
felix dives into the
musical unknown
T
his mesmerizing record is
the third in a series of com-
pilations from Soundway
Records. It explores the mu-
sical delights of 60’s and 70’s Panama,
through records which the compilers,
Will Hollan (Quantic), Roberto Gye-
mant (Beto) and Miles Cleret, found
in radio station backrooms and dusty
record shops in the unique Isthmus.
I’ll assume that not many Imperial
students know a thing about this vi-
brant music scene and you may simi-
larly assume as much about myself.
However, this compilation is present-
ed sympathetically and allows the un-
versed listener to form an appreciation
of the exciting context in which Pana-
manian musicians mixed language and
musical form with obvious success.
A 22-page booklet accompanies the
compilation and greatly enhances the
experience. It contains vintage photos
that provide a great visual scenery for
the music and crucially, the compil-
ers provide enthusiatstic notes which
cement the compilation’s accessibil-
ity. A prime example is in the notes
for “20 de Enero en Ocu” where Beto
highlights the “rumba” of the song by
noting the lyrics sung when the sec-
tion begins.
Beto hails “Chombo Pa’ La Tien-
da” by Frederick Clarke as the com-
pliation’s “centrepiece” and, not-
withstanding my aforementioned
innocence in this area of music,
I wholeheartedly agree. The title
roughly translates as “Chombo goes
to the store” and the comedic theatre
of his mother’s shouting along with
the colourful language make it an un-
forgettable song.
As a whole, the compilation is a
highly enjoyable record which will ap-
peal to anyone with a curious ear.
