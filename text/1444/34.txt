I’ve been
brutially raped

or those of you who don’t
know me, me and my hair
have a special relationship.
It can be likened to the re-
lationship between a girl-
friend and your mother- if they are not
spoken of in the same sentence then
everything is deemed fine. It’s not that
I don’t like my hair, more that I just
couldn’t give a shit. It grows, I was it
and it grows. Whatever I seem to do,
I look like a nonce, and when I finally
get it cut I get a cold head. Your classic
lose-lose situation.
However this week I decided that it
was about time for a trim, so took my-
self down to South Kensington with
the hope that by the time I return I’d
have the hair of Beckham. Not to be,
as the hairdressers was closed. Not the
be defeated, and now feeling like a lion
after its prey I ventured to Gloucester
Road and strode into the first one I
found. Despite the fact that I have (he
looks like a girl- ed) flowing locks that
any female would be proud of, access to
the premises was denied. Apparently
they only cut the hair of the fairer sex.
Bastards. I made sure I didn’t make my
mistake at my next stop, walked in and
asked the woman if “she could lop all
this off?”. Apparently she could, which
was good. Now, I may be acting a little
harsh on the girl, but that was the brief.
When asked if I wanted the clippers,
or if she should taper it, what did she
really expect? Seriously love, if I come
out with less hair than I what I came
in with it’s pretty much job done. Yet
the barrage of questions was unstoppa-
ble, surely after the first few grunts and
blank looks she’d understand?
Well moving onto the whole ‘hair-
dressing experience.’ What and expe-
rience! I cannot possibly fathom as to
how it can ever be classified as enjoy-
able. What with the inane chitter chat-
ter about Lola- who the fuck is Lola?
and the hair dryer constantly blasting
hot air in my face, I was almost ready
to just call it a day and bail. As my long
suffering ex-girlfriend will tell you, hair
dryers and I don’t get on that well- all
that hot air in my face... it’s not for me
really. So when I grimace at the first
jet stream, please don’t do it again, any
why do it right at the very end just be-
fore I leave? Since when did the hair-
dressers become a torture chamber? I
feel, abused and brutally head raped!

6. Sleep:
Since coming to Imperial, we all
have found a new penchant for a
good long nap. Not since I was a
small child have I ever had such a
desire for an afternoon nap, or not
being able to make it through the
day without one!
In fact, I believe that it should be
actively encouraged to nap through
any 9am lectures that you may
have and doze through the 10am
ones. If you’ve been up partying/
nailing many chicks into the small
hours of the morning you get pretty
tired. We all know that you can’t
work tired, so a quick power nap
and boom, you’re back up to 100%
working capacity.
However be warned, this is not
something that I recommend you
should do in as exam for the fear of
the dreaded over-sleep. This may
hamper you chances of a first.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in
a cell and must be surrounded with
a corresponding number of lines.
Lines cannot split and there can
only be one continuous line. Any
cells with no numbers can have any
number of lines. Look at the solu-
tion above for help.
