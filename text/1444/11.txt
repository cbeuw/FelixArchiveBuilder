Fall of the Berlin Wall: 20 years on
T
his Monday saw the twenti-
eth anniversary of the East
German government an-
nouncing that its citizens
were free to visit West Germany. This
started the tearing down of the Ber-
lin Wall at the hands of iconic crowds
on both sides, amid euphoric scenes.
Those celebrating in Germany were
joined by people around the world
who saw his as a symbol of the most
deadly ideology the world had ever
seen self-destructing. The rallying cry
“five years before the fall of the Berlin
wall no one could have predicted it” is
still used across the globe by seemingly
weak movements fighting tyranny.
Twenty years on, it is saddening to
read a recent global poll of 29000 peo-
ple by the BBC. It shows that many of
the lessons learned from the results
of seventy years of ignoring the laws
of human action appear to have been
forgotten. The poll was conducted to
assess changing levels of confidence
in markets over the past two decades.
The results, reported in an article ti-
tled “Free markets flawed, says survey”
suggest that eight out of nine people
across the 27 countries surveyed be-
lieve that the free market does not
work well and that more regulation
will make it more efficient.
The silver lining is that at least it
should help end the absurd idea many
have that “but most people think that
X” is a legitimate argument for X. But
the ignorance shown is sickening given
the extent to which the same elector-
ates that typically believe economics
is a difficult area best left to experts
are willing to go in endorsing the im-
position of policies advocated by one
school over others.
Twenty years after the symbolic end of Communism in Eastern Europe, Business Editor Sina Ataherian looks at
the changing public understanding of socialism, markets, economics and government intervention
East and West Germans meet on November 9th 1989 to tear down the Berlin Wall and reunite their nation
as mises.org, home of the prestigious
Ludwig von Mises Institute in the US.
But today it is even creeping its way
slowly but surely into mainstream
media, especially on Reuters and
Bloomberg.
In the week that ironically saw both
the twentieth anniversary celebrations
of the fall of the Berlin wall and the
passing of the Affordable Healthcare
for America Act, we should pause to
consider the significance of the BBC
poll. Are the results as bad as may be
feared? Many who felt capitalism was
not working, such as Michal Moore
who has made entire films on the sub-
ject, confuse it for the existing system
of corporatism and special interest
groups. In fact, the word capitalism
sounds like a system that favours capi-
tal above the other factors of produc-
tion and so is unnecessarily confusing.
Advocates of free markets should
emphasise that their position is not to
serve capital above all else, but to al-
low individuals to buy and sell what
they want on a voluntary basis without
the government intermediating. They
should make clear that they oppose all
redistribution – including from society
to the banks - and all central planning –
including of the money supply. Again,
only the Austrian school has done this
and so only they can legitimately claim
to understand and support markets.
The government claims to want to
help the poor, yet introduces car scrap-
page schemes that destroy the entire
market that they could previously have
accessed: cheap, old cars. It transfers
billions to the same banks that it regu-
lates to stop individuals and smaller
firms competing with. It starts unde-
gages with taxpayer money. Similar
policies have been the sole cause of
every artificial boom and subsequent
bust since the American recession of
1921. In each instance, coercive mis-
management aftrwards has greatly
worsened the problem.
Notice that was the ‘recession of
1921’ rather than the ‘recession of
the 1920s’ precisely because the War-
ren G. Harding administration rightly
embraced it as the healthy correction
to First World War over-spending. It
recognised the problem as over-priced
The recession has served a use-
ful purpose in restricting a zoo of
economic schools into two: lazy and
sound. There is a strong consensus
amongst the exuberant crowds that the
financial crisis was caused by a lack of
regulation. Most politicians and their
court intellectuals pander to this view
relentlessly. At the same time, anyone
willing to spend sometime thinking
through what happened and why, is
in for a treat. It is easy to see that the
Austrian school is unique in all of its
leading figures predicting the events of
2008 in great detail years before they
occurred.
For the first time in a while, the in-
centive for individuals to favour sound
over lazy economics is obvious – not
being caught out the next time state
intervention messes up the economy.
Much as the likes of Summers and
Stiglitz would like to pretend other-
wise, free markets will always exist in
one form or another, and especially in
the analysis of current affairs. In the
past non-economists who got confused
by Krugman’s New York Times articles
advocating a housing bubble (precisely
his words) may have turned to similar
writers dominating big media. After
seeing that each was as nonsensical as
the next, they may have concluded that
the subject must just be too compli-
cated for them to understand.
But more recently, analysis that cuts
through the spin and explains in an
intuitively convincing and exact way
the causes of economic woes and pre-
dicts the effects of further screwing
with markets has grown exponentially
in popularity. Such analysis could al-
ways be found in sources dedicated to
advancing rational scholarship, such
clared wars promising quick victories
and ends up staying aimlessly for po-
tentially decades. If you can see that
there is something amiss in all this, but
cannot see an alternative, it is because
we have never really had one within
living memory.
The political side of free market ad-
vocacy may be the most impassioned,
but it is unlikely to get us anywhere,
as individuals. Instead, we can rely on
the principle that any informational
advantage tends to yield material re-
turns. In this case, rejecting anti-mar-
ket propaganda confers two immedi-
ate benefits. It helps us understand the
true value of jobs that rely upon open
and fair competition and thus be more
inclined to go after them. Almost as
importantly, this rejection will enable
us to accurately predict the real af-
fects of government policy in any line
of business that we may chose to enter.
The recent financial crisis saw pan-
icked Keynesians and assorted other
pro-Fed sidekicks gain an early up-
per hand. They established into our
conventional wisdom the idea that
because banks are associated with
markets and with the crisis, we can
conclude the crisis was itself caused
by markets, especially unregulated
ones. This is therefore a good place
for anyone interested in uncovering
the link between damaging markets
and causing damaging to the economy
to begin.
The recession, great or otherwise,
was caused by the US government
combining the fraud of paper-money
printing (in legal tender currency that
we would be imprisoned for not using)
with the theft of guaranteeing mort-
assets, an increase in risk-aversion,
and liquidity issues for firms and their
customers. These are all problems that
free markets naturally incentivise en-
trepreneurs to solve. Unlike all pred-
ecessor administrations to date, it did
not pick out the one saving grace of
recession – lower price levels – as the
problem to ‘correct’.
Of course it is always tempting to
end our studies here and revert to lazy
economics, where we assume the peo-
ple whose views get the most coverage
must be right. If their thoughts are too
incomprehensible to be worth explor-
ing, we may think it is because we lack
the ability to understand and give up.
But it is extraordinarily dangerous to
assume something is as it is for reasons
beyond our comprehension.
It is interesting that these pseudo-
economists tend to be from universi-
ties, and so are hardly unbiased com-
mentators on government spending.
They have never had to test their ideas
in real markets. Far greater sympa-
thy for sound reasoning can be found
amongst those who do so regularly, in
places such as Mises or Bloomberg.
Economists who argue that we fail to
understand the situation should verify
this by at least attempting to enlighten
us. More and more people are now
demanding his, and educating them-
selves, which would explain support
for auditing the “Federal” Reserve, cur-
rently sanding at 75% amongs Ameri-
cans. The obvious signs of discomfort
in Bernanke’s body language on his
tours earlier this year to campaign for
Fed ‘independence’ left us wonder-
ing whether the sneers are merely at-
tempts to cover deep insecurity.
