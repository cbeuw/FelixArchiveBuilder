Overseas Students Conference
It was agreed to send Messrs. Phillips
and Kourouniotis plus any two other
interested people.
Presidents Report
Mr. Sayles reported that there were
still a few places left on the French
trip. It was agreed that £50 should be
donated towards the expenses of the
trip.
There was discussion on the possibil-
ity of moving the Union Offices into
the union building. (This was mention-
ed in the presidents report in last Felix.)
Mr. Sayles was given permission to
proceed with the required negotiations.
Mr. Sayles circulated copies of a
petition calling upon the Government
to take an urgent look at nurses pay
and conditions. These copies were to be
circulated throughout the college.
Hon. Sees. Report
Mr. Wadsworth reported that ar-
rangements had been made to receive
nominations for Soc-
ial Colours and Union
General Awards.
Council agreed to
e x t e n d reciprocal
agreements to the
London College of
Dance and Drama,
and to Aberdeen Uni-
versity.
: M r . Wadsworth reported that the
selection of the Rag Charities for the
next session would take place at the
Annual General Meeting of I C U .
Council agreed to his request that
the Entertainments Committee be al-
lowed to continue their legal case
against Fudge Enterprises over the £700
owed to them. N U S would cover 75
per cent of the costs from their legal
aid fund.
Mr. Wadsworth brought up the ques-
tion of the Pratt Committee and there
was a lengthy discussion on what
should be submitted from Imperial
College Union to the Committee. It was
agreed that an open meeting should be
held to finalise the details to be sub-
mitted. It was agreed that the following
items should be discussed at the meet-
ing
1) Maintenance—troubles that arise
due to the lack of skilled college
labour.
2) Facilities for students—the lack
of accommodation for students
during the vacations and the
overcrowding of the refectories. It
was agreed though that we recog-
nised that the extra income helped
keep the costs down during the
term.
Mr. Phillips summed up the prob-
lems as arising from a lack of finance
in the universities sector. M r . Starkey
suggested that greater use could be
made of departmental facilities.
The general consensus was that the
possibility of streamlining the adminis-
tration of College in such a fashion
that facilities could be allocated more
favourably should be examined.
C O U N C I L

Dep. President's Report
Council agreed that the existing news-
paper distribution should continue.
There was a brief discussion concern-
ing the clashing of dates of various
committee meetings. M r . Jackson
hoped that it might be possible to in-
corporate this in the Union diary so
that meetings could be agreed and pub-
lished in advance.
Finance
It was agreed that £40 should be
donated towards the cost of the N U S
Emergency conference to be held on
June 15.
Concern was expressed about the fact
that there seemed to be no reports
from the editor of Phoenix. It was
agreed that no further payment should
be made until a report was forthcom-
ing.
Mr. Sayles reported that the financing
of the Nightline sabbatical was being
looked into by the Rector, and the other
Rectors concerned in the U S K area.
There was consider-
able discussion on the
Union's investments,
mainly due to our
holding in Distillers
Company Ltd. shares.
After a series of votes
it was decided to con-
tinue with our hold-
ing in Distillers shares.
Exploratory Committee
Mr. Smith reported that the com-
mittee had met again and altered its
decisions on various items (see last
Felix).
ICWA Constitution

SCAB Report
Mr. Starkey presented his report.as
acting S C A B Chairman. It was agreed
that there would be no further Council
restrictions on Ents concerts. A S C A B
executive was agreed to, consisting of
the S C A B Chairman, Secretary, Assis-
tant Secretary and Hon. Senior Treas-
urer. In future the title "Social Secre-
tary" will be removed from any refer-
ences which allude to the S C A B Chair-
man. Finally, it was agreed that S C A B
would pay £10 each time there was a
concert in the Great Hall (with Mr.
Wadsworth giving a humorous example
of what was or wasn't a concert).
Discussion on Council
Mr. Phillips presented a discussion
paper on the limits of Council's author-
ity. Various members stated that it
would need an expert to rewrite the
Union constitution and that one should
be called in. It was generally agreed
that some sort of document laying down
what powers Council, U G M s and vari-
ous committees had would be very
useful.
The meeting closed

VACATION
JOBS
At about this time of
year, I'm sure many of
you must be searching for
means to supplement your
income during the sum-
mer vacation.
Also at this time of
year there is a continuous
flow of jobs, offered for
the vacation, coming into
the Union office.
They are all displayed
on the Union notice board
in the Union entrance.
Several of them are of-
fering fairly decent salar-
ies, so, if you are short
©f a job, just cast a glance
at the board and contact
the people concerned.
NUS
EXEC
"What is N U S Execu-
tive doing?" On Tuesday,
28th May, they had book-
ed, and paid for, a room
in the Union for an Exec
meeting.
The following note was
found pinned to the of-
fice door:
Dear * ! @ X N U S Exec,
Have been here since
6.30 p.m. We resolved not
to die of thirst. Having
noted your absence, we
adjourned to the Bar at
7.25 p.m.

JEZ
REALLY
WORKS
Featured here is an old
(1964, May) photograph
of the RCSU mascot, Jez,
travelling back from
Brighton.
Things are looking up,
however. After her recent
renovation, crash and re-
renovation, Jez has been
called back into service.
Apparently, to the amaze-
ment of passers-by, her
fire extinguisher was used
to put out a burning
moped last month. Shame
she doesn't have a pump
to do the job in style.

First, some nostalgia. Dark intrigue, malevolent suspicion and
lemon-flavoured peanuts were the ingredients of the silly little outcry
which was heard after the publication of the first Scaramanga articles
in which I collated the grass-roots opinion of the time, with regard
to the state of R C S U , into a tangible criticism which immediately
impinged itself on the faint hearts of the R C S U clique-soe of the
time. Since then the clique has degenerated from being the epitomy
of all that is secretive, juvenile and weak, to being a total shambles:
non-entities trammeled up in their grandiose delusions, who couldn't
even organise the annual R C S U dinner and the Silwood Ball properly.
But enough of Ron Kill and such trivia, on to the present.
Speculation is intense concerning how well each member of next
year's I C U Exec will cope with the other two members as millstones
around his/her neck. Co-operation and keeping personalities out of
decision-making never have been RCSU's strong characteristics. Guess-
ing to which C C U next year's I C U Exec belong doesn't quite warrant
a kupie doll. Failure to make the correct guess, however, wins you
a snot-lump in the eye.
Now for a quick collation of views which try to assess this year's
exec: Norm Sayles appears to have started out hesitantly and perhaps
a bit naively at the beginning of the session but eventually got to
grips with the task in hand. The most significant view has been that
he has steadfastly refrained from becoming isolated and aloof. 'Nuff
said.
Dave Sinclair has taken a lot of stick during his time as DP. His
cock-up over Mike, the IC mascot perpetuated the myth of his incom-
petency syndrome. Whatever his shortcomings as a Union building
manager it remains that he has worked hard at what must be the
crummiest job in the Union.
Inevitably, we coast along to our esteemed Hon Sec, P. A . Wads-
worth, BSc, ARCS, who has been unofficially dubbed "the biggest
egotist in I C U " . The basis for such criticism appears to stem solely
from personality clashes. The overriding fact is that he has succeeded
in dragging Felix from its hitherto unplumbable depths and making
it into something worth reading.
In conclusion, comrades, it is with misted eyes that I wind up the
final Scaramanga column. A question which has been raised many
times is "Why does Scaramanga do it?". Allegations of bitterness,
frustration and just-doing-it-out-of-boredom have no basis. The major
motivation has been my concern for the state of the Union and its
vulnerability to mismanagement. A l l too often, union officers (of all
the Unions) tend to assume that they are God's gift to the Union,
though there are notable exceptions. I felt then that such a silly
state of affairs ought to be put into a clearer perspective for all to
see. In short: Gory toads have been excavated, warts and all; glossy
toads have shone brightly, with fixed stupid grins; but clearly
there's nothing happier than a dead toad, believe you me.
Ecce, sodalitas ostrea mea erat!
Scaramanga
The Union meeting on Thursday, 23
May, succeeded in passing two motions
to be submitted to the Extraordinary
conference and also managed to close
without the quorum being challenged
(though it was not quite quorate).
Free Speech
Mr. Lynch proposed a motion call-
nig for a removal of the famous amend-
ment 4 and condemning the
NUS's actions. M r . Phillips
proposed a lengthy amend-
ment (to be submitted to the
conference). This advised col-
leges not to help racist organ-
isations and to make their
own decisions on whether to
allow such speakers to use
Union facilities. It also con-
demned those that disrupt
meetings by physical means.
There were speeches for and against
and, on a vote, the amendment was
added to the original motion whilst
leaving the main points of the original
intact.
Another amendment, proposed by
Ms. Attenborough, was defeated.
There were several lively speeches on
the motion with Ms. Glaser, Overseas
Students Committee Chairman getting
the best reception when she spoke for
the motion.
The motion was carried with very
few votes against.
Grants
Arising out of the new grants award,
Mr. Watkins proposed a motion to be
u
G
M
submitted to the conference.
It called for a continuation of the
campaign for higher grants but with
emphasis now being placed on discre-
tionary awards, means testing and
discrimination against women and
overseas students. It also called for
adequate nursery education.
No-one spoke against the motion
and so it became Union policy.
The passing of these two
motions means that for the
first time in a long time the
delegation for N U S confer-
ence have specific mandates
for the items under discussion.
Elections
There were six candidates
for five delegate places and
an observer's place for Extra-
ordinary conference.
Subject to official approval by a
Union meeting, Mrs. Gerrard, Messrs.
Kill, East, Phillips and Watkins were
elected as delegates and Mr. Lane as
observer.
Chip Shops
The final item referred to the decline
in the number of fish and chip shop?
(chippies), and the lack of chippie?
in the local album.
It instructed the Exec, to write to
the Prime Minister, and the Minister
of Agriculture and Fisheries complain-
ing about the situation and asking the
Government to support the fish and
chip industry.
