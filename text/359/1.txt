NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
4th JUNE 1974 FREE
GRANTS
REVIEW
So it finally happened. The grants increase that
has been waited for for so long finally arrived. The
details are given below.
At a time of severe economic difficulties we, as
University students can think ourselves very lucky to
have won a 25% increase. However, we ought to
remember that not all students are single males,
attending University, and with either drastically poor
or fabulously rich parents.
If you are a married female your grant has increa-
sed but not to the full level; but at the same time
deductions will be made according to the level of
her husband's income.
If you are not at University you are still at the
mercy of your local education authority as to whether
you get £10, £100 or £500.
If you have parents earning more ithan £1700 you
will still be means tested and have your grant cut.
I know from bitter experience just what this can
mean.
A t the last Union meeting a motion was passed
pointing out the inadequacies of the new award and
calling on the N U S to continue the campaign with
an emphasis on these great anomalies.
When the DES were contacted on Friday regarding
P.G. grants they informed us that an announcement
was not expected till the first week in July at the
earliest.
As yet there has been no announcement regarding
post-graduate grants.

(5) Spouse's Contribution
A contribution according to
income will be required from
the husband or wife of a
married student whose grant
is not subject to a parental
contribution. The spouse's
contribution will be assessed
on a similar basis to the
parental contribution. Fur-
ther details will be issued as
soon as possible.
(6) Changes in Disregards
of Income
Student's Income.—In calcu-
lating the student's income
for the purpose of assessing
his grant the amount which
may be disregarded will be
increased from £100 to £130.
(7) Improvements in the
position of widowed, divor-
ced or separated women
students with dependants
Under certain circumstan-
ces widowed, divorced or
separated women students
with dependants may at pre-
sent have their grant increa-
sed by £100. From 1 Septem-
ber the extra grant or dis-
regard will be increased to
£200.
Widowed, divorced or separ-
ated women students are
also allowed to have certain
sums in respect of their de-
pedent children disregarded
from their income when
grant is assessed instead of
receiving the normal depen-
dants' allowances. These
sums will be increased as
follows:—

(8) Improvements in the
Position of Disabled Students
The Awards Regulations will
be amended to give local
education authorities discre-
tion to pay sums up to £100
per annum to disabled stu-
dents where authorities con-
sider individual circumstan-
ces justify this.
Next year's president is Trev. Phillips, Esq. The Felix editor is Mike Williams,
Esq. Here the two can be seen working in harmony to attack a statue of Queen
Victoria situated within the Queen's Tower (surprise, surprise).
It is unknown whether Mike's index finger in her ear is indicative of how much
notice he will take next year. The positions of the other hands on a certain area
of her anatomy is open to speculation.
