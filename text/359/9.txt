CALM AT
ESSEX
The general committee
of senate at Essex Univer-
sity defeated tough new
proposals last Wednesday
week, and the picket fin-
ished last Friday week.
With these two moves
calm now appears to be
returning to the campus.
The possibility of grant-
ing an area to the stu-
dent's union for its own
use is to be looked into
and the students' union is
confident that such an
area will be found.
The disciplinary propo-
sals, which would have
vested all powers of the
disciplinary committee in
the proctor, were defeat-
ed in the general commit-
tee of the senate by 33
votes to two. \
At a students' union
meeting it was decided
unanimously to end the
picket and the blacking of
retail outlets with the ex-
ception of the general
store which is to be boy-
cotted as part of a cam-
paign against higher
prices.
The union has decided
to freeze £20 of the Con-
servative Association's
funds. Mr. Colin Bear-
don, president-elect, said
that the association had
tried to claim expenses
for the visit of M r . John
Biggs-Davison,' M.P., but
they had not adopted the
proper procedure and the
students' union had not
approved of the meeting.
The Conservative Asso-
ciation then said that they
would withdraw their
funds in any event and
the union decided to
freeze their funds for this
, year as a penalty. A
member of the associa-
tion said last week that
if the money was not re-
turned they would take
legal action.
I C and
OIL
The University Grants
Committee has recom-
mended that Heriot-Watt
University in Edinburgh
and Imperial College,
London, should become
centres for education in
petroleum engineering.
This follows the propo-
sals of an inter-depart-
mental working party in
education and training for
offshore developments,
which suggested that two
such centres should be
established in Britain.
Plans are now in hand
to finalise the details of
Imperial's course.
R C A
Annually, the Royal
College of Art (at the rear
of the Union) holds an
exhibition of the work
done by its students dur-
ing the year.
Contrary to popular
opinion, R C A students do
not spend all their time
painting nudes. Their
range of work is quite
amazing. Silverware and
jewellery, textiles, cera-
mics, still and movie
photography, architectu-
ral designs, modern sculp-
ture, painting, furniture,
graphics . . . the list is
endless. Numerous stu-
dents also work on indus-
trial design. In recent
years they have covered
power drills, hi-fi speak-
ers, cabins for boats, cash
tills, invalid carriages.
This year's exhibition is
from 13th to 18th June,
open from 10.00 - 20.00,
admission free. Most ex-
hibits are in the main
R.C.A. building, with
large sculpture in their
Queen Gate building and
painting in Exhibition
Road (back of Huxley
Vuilding).
It is certainly an exhibi-
tion not to be missed.
A BROAD
LEFT
VIEW ON
E D I T O R I A L
So at last we reach the
end of another Felix era.
As from next issue (when-
ever that may be) Felix
will be printed on offset
litho. This, however, is not
new as it was printed on
litho for a number of
years at the turn of the
sixties.
The main difference
this time is, of course, that
the printing will be done
on the premises with our
own machines. The ad-
vantages are obvious. Not
only will it be much
cheaper but also we will
have complete control
over every stage of the
production (which will
help avoid the poor paper
quality and atrocious fold-
ing of the last issue) even-
tually leading to a better
quality issue altogether.
My thanks to Scara-
manga (page 3) for his
comments about Felix,
(no comment on the
other section). I feel, how-
ever, that it is not fully
justified. A l l I have ever
tried to do with Felix is
to print the articles that
people wanted to read.
This means quite a lot of
bum-kicking (that is a k
and not an 1) to encourage
the strongest supporters of
people to write their arti-
cles on time, and on the
whole this has been suc-
cessful. The life-blood of
Felix is its articles. Before
I took over it had reached
the situation where no-
one would write articles
because no-one would
ever read Felix. A l l I
have done is to change
that situation.
I hope that next year's
editor will use some of the
ideas that I have tried,
along with others that I
haven't had time to try.
The societies' page was
an immense success, nor-
mally being subscribed for
two issues hence. I would
encourage even more soci-
eties to take the oppor-
tunity of advertising them-
selves to the freshmen
during the first term.
Sport is always a favour-
ite and here I must give
my deepest thanks to Bob
Barley for the extra bum-
kicking that he has given
the sports clubs to ensure
that they write their
articles, and for the many
hours that he must have
spent counting words so
that I didn't have the
chore. But of course my
main thanks must go to
all those that have written
articles for submission, be
they humorous, factual,
boring (sorry Trev) or
even ones that I disagreed
with.
Keep them coming dur-
ing the next year and
Felix will be even better
than it has been this year.
N E X T ISSUE,
It is not known yet
whether this will be the
last issue to be printed
this term. I hope to pro-
duce an off-set litho
printed edition in the last
week of term. This will be
mainly for annual re-
ports, colours lists and
the like though I am quite
willing to print any short
articles that you may
have, I say short, though,
because I will probably
have to type out all the
articles and typing is not
my strong point. It will be
possible to do photo-
graphs (I hope). If you
have any short articles
that you would like print-
ing could you please let
me have them by Friday,
14th June.
C H I L E
Those of you in the
know may remember, that
I am not exactly one of
the C h i l e campaigns,
mainly due to disinterest.
Despite that, I would en-
courage you to read the
article on the centre
spread. It is an eye Wit-
ness report, made recently
by a delegation to the
country that included an
NUS representative. I
think that you will find
it to be quite an eye-
opener.
A N N U A L G E N E R A L
M E E T I N G
The most light-hearted
of the Union meetings
will be held on Thursday
June 13th in the Great
Hall, College Block at
1.00. This is usually a
very lively affair, with the
added interest this year of
the rag charities for the
next session. The Union
General Awards and ICU
Social Colours are also
presented at this meeting.
The final item is, as usual
the official hand-over,
rather strange as myself,
Norm and all the others
do not relinquish our
posts till July 31 st. Any-
way, it makes a change
from the usual boring
meetings and is definitely
not to be missed. Fancy
dress is quite welcome.
ABORTION
The Society for the
Protection of the Unborn
Child, a powerful lobby
for the repeal of the
Abortion Law, held its
annual rally on Sunday,
April 28th in London. It
claimed an attendance of
80,000 — in reality a fi-
gure of between 40-
50,000, but despite the
overestimations of the
organisers, the truth is
that SPUC is growing in
size in all areas, and in-
creasing its influence
amongst working class.
On Sunday as people
assembled to the faded
tunes of organ music
reminiscent of "Stars on
Sunday" they were greet-
ed by an anti-demonstra-
tion organised by the
Women's L i b e r a t i o n
Movement, the N.U.S.
and Left groups. The
anti-demo was small in
comparison to SPUC's
2,000.
The real importance of
the Left of organisations
such as SPUC is twofold.
Firstly, the demand for
women to control their
own biology and sexuality
is integral to the Left, as
it challenges the patriar-
chal basis of our society
and the role of the nu-
clear family in class
society. Thus it is a prin-
ciple which the whole of
the Left must actively
support. Secondly, given
the allegations that the
stewards at the SPUC
events are close associates
of the National Front, we
must be aware that the
potential force for mobili-
sation over an emotive
issue such as abortion
need not necessarily stop
there — once mobilised
and organised this be-
comes a platform for fur-
ther reaction. The Na-
tional Front are not inte-
rested in protecting life—
they are interested in the
maintenance of a particu-
lar form of capitalism
within which the psycho-
logy of patriarchy plays
an integral part. They do
not support SPUC be-
cause they believe in the
sanctity of human life—
certain associates of
theirs have throughout
history played such
hideous parts in destroy-
ing it.
The Left must recog-
nise its responsibility to
counter the false ideas
perpetuated through orga-
nisations like SPUC be-
cause they highlight all
the connections between
sexism, racism and the
basis of capitalism. We
must do this by counter-
ing the organisations
themselves at the same
time as we actively adopt
the demands of the
Women's Movement and
fight for them.
SPUC maintains that
abortion is murder and
that it kills — we say that
back street abortion kills
women; SPUC maintains
that " a l l " have a right to
live — we say . that all
children should be wanted
children and that only
women have the right to
decide whether or not
they want a child. We
do not believe that 'if you
play with fire you should
be prepared to be burnt"
— we believe that sexua-
lity is an integral part of
every person and not
simply a factor for repro-
duction. We also believe
that children born un-
wanted or into the misery
of poverty suffer. We de-
mand contraception
which is safe and free and
when it fails the right for
every woman to receive
an abortion on the N a -
tional Health if she does
not want a child.
PURPLE PATCH
Here we are at the end of yet an-
other year. (Remarkable, isn't it — this
is almost identical to the way in which
I began the first article in Felix this
year!!!), and let's face it, what dif-
ference can you see in the Union to
what you could see at the beginning
of the year. N O T H I N G . In many ways
you are correct, in that not very much
has changed during our year as far as
the majority of students are concerned,
although this does not itnean that noth-
ing has been happening. Many pro-
jects have got off the ground, and it
will not be until next year that you
begin to see the benefits of these, such
as the proposed alterations to the
Union Building, and also the new
printing unit which we are getting. New
accommodation has been found which
will help students next year — in fact
we will be able to accommodate around
70 more students in houses around col-
lege and also there is a possibility of
our getting more accommodation which
we will let to married post-graduates,
but this is still in the pipeline. You may
very well see or rather hear a Campus
Radio station in action next year,
which should help you to find out more
of what your Union is trying to do
for you.
I could go on for a long time on
all the items which we have done for
you, and also about all those items
which you have been doing for your-
selves, but I am sure that you would
only get bored and begin to say: "Well,
that is what we elected them to do
anyhow, so why are they blowing their
own trumpets?", and I would say that
this would be a very justified com-
ment.
Coming up to the present, most of
you (Undergraduates especially) will be
in the throes of examinations at pre-
sent. I am very lucky this year in not
having any, but you have my fullest
sympathy, and I hope that you all at
least manage to scrape through them
and on to yet another fruitful year at
college.
One comment which I feel I must
make at this point is dealing with that
controversial topic of negotiation. I
have been told many times that we
should not become too involved in the
mechanics of college block or we will
merely become a sub-section of their
administration. Up to a point I would
agree with this philosophy but I, and
I think the rest of this year's executive,
would agree that the only way in which
to expect co-operation from the col-
lege is to co-operate from this side,
and not merely expect everything to
be handed to us on a plate. This has
always been the way in this college,
and is the reason for the good rela-
tions which we have with the college
at present, and I for one would be very
unhappy to see this situation deteriorat-
ing.
This year we have achieved a very
good working relationship and I be-
lieve that this is one which we should
nurture and foster in the future.
Coming back on to student matters.
Sick as it may seem to say this, we
have had very little trouble from the
students in the college this year. By
this 1 mean groups causing trouble
of one sort or another, especially on
the Political front. This has made my
job a lot easier, and left me to be able
to deal with some of the more impor-
tant difficulties of certain students
which have normally proved to be far
more interesting to handle, and also far
more rewarding to see the solution of.
All in all 1 have had a great year
and although I don't think that I would
ever repeat it, I would not have missed
it for the world. I would like to take
this opportunity of saying thank you
to all those people who throughout the
year have helped to make the job seem
less like Hell, and have at many times
really put themselves out to help orga-
nising and also sorting out various
items, without you it would have been
impossible to have- done those things
which I wanted to do. Thanks a million.
It looks as though my summer could
prove to be a very interesting one,
and I hope that you all get to have at
least some time to yourselves away
from college, and have a whale of a
lime.
Thanks once again for giving me a
great year, I hope that I have been
able to make a good attempt at the
job which last year you elected me to
do.
Yours in the Union,
Norm.
