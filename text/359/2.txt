LETTERS
SPEAKERS
from T. B. Tang
Sir, — We have been
accorded much attention
from the establishments in
the society, and in the
College there are a great
variety of lectures, discus-
sion meetings, etc.,
1. by eminent people, on
popular topics of current
interest
2. by "professional"
speakers, on controversial
issues.
Seldom, if ever, do we
students invite ordinary
members of other social
groups such as farm lab-
ourers, miners, nurses,
small-shop owners, and
farmers. I think it must be
because they will not be
eloquent and sophisticated
enough to be worthy of
listening to or talking to,
or is it that we are not in-
terested in their problems,
values and views, for they
are not people that matter
(to us).

THOUGHTS
from A. N. Other
Sir, —: Recent articles in
your paper provoked me
to thought, albeit most
certainly not original
thoughts, herein given ex-
pression far more poor
than that they received
when their authors first
set them forth having been
refined with much more
labour of their mind be-
fore their presentment to
the world. I acknowledge
before you my debt to-
wards them, and all men,
who live, and have ever
lived and towards our
children, and their child-
ren as yet unborn but
whose future is of the
greatest concern to every
man who is born into this
world.
What accident of birth
was it by which that I
should be born with cer-
tain mechanisms of my
mind developed that after
twenty years I should be
found among the elite, so-
called by those who belong
to it, enjoying all the privi-
leges that such a position
affords, with as yet unex-
plored privilege, beyond
the gates of this distin-
guished college, springing
from the benificent doct-
rine of the same, in which
1 am educated?
To me this is a wonder-
ful ponderable, yet I am
sure to confess for I must,
I am unable to answer it:
apply it to yourself, dear
reader, and to any other
person, whose welfare is
comprehended w i t h i n
yours. 1 could not have
been born elsewhere or at
any other time, he would
not have been I, nor I he.
We are products distinc-
tively of this generation,
our nature is derived from
the whole family of the
earth, so for this we owe
every man our allegiance,
in particular I, my parents,
to whom I cannot say "I
don't need my foot" or
"because I am a brain I
don't need a foot" (is this
not the sense of the
other?!). Would that the
fool could understand, that
feet he so despises is him-
self as much as that brain!
In the same way he says
"Begone!" to his parents
denies himself, for who is
it that bore him or deliv-
ered his seed to her?
Again, she who bore me
has cared for me, a task
impossible but for the co-
operation and of every
member of the state (and
hence the world).
In some sense then I
owe my existence today to
every other person in the
world (consider that this
country depends to a great
extent on trade), that
means Nixon and Kosygin,
as well as Marx and
Caesar, who though dead
have influenced my life. I
cannot measure the value
of their contributions, who
knows what they may be?
Nor can I condemn them
out of hand. I may say
they do wrong, but am I
any less or more of a man
than they? Do you not see
I am as much, is it any
less of a wrong that I
speak not to N . E. Boddie
in the lab?
Having seen my depen-
dence on the state, what
do I do? Bow down and
worship it? surely no! De-
stroy it? Never, for that
would be to destroy my-
self. I was born in cove-
nant with the state (cov-
enant for I had no part in
the making of the 'agree-
ment") and live under the
same. The covenant is with
you dear reader and every
other man, who is born in-
to this world. The hier-
archy we see is an evidence
of this; it serves us, not we
it, and we serve each oth-
er. Can you understand?
Surely then we must seek
to improve the society the
state (and I mean too my-
self; how can this multi-
tudinous state be better if
I am not changed?) and in
improving it we show our
love for those who follow
after us, our children and
their children as yet un-
born.
In this let us not for-
get that it will not occur
in a day, consider that the
flower that grows in the
night will perish in a day
under the heat of the sun
or Juaan s gourd which
shrivelled as quickly as it
grew, but the seed sown in
spring dies, and in autumn
is harvested providing for
many, with abundant
supply.

FISH
&
CHIP
SHOPS
i
i
CHIPPIES
Arising from the U G M
held recently, the follow-
ing letter was sent to M r .
H . Wilson.
Dear Mr. Wilson,
We have been asked to
write to you regarding the
disturbing reports about
the state of the fish and
chip industry.
At a meeting of the Im-
perial College Union held
recently, the following
motion was passed with-
out any opposition:
Imperial College Union
notes that chippies (fish
and chip shops) are
closing at the rate of
700 per year.
Imperial College Union
notes the disturbing
situation regarding chip-
pies, i.e. that there are
none in the South Ken-
sington area.
Imperial College Union
mandatess the Executive
to write to the Prime
Minister, Minister of
Agriculture & Fisheries,
and to anybody else
they can think of, pro-
testing against this out-
rage and calling for
Government support to
the fish and chip indus-
try.
The fish and chip shops
have been part of the
great British tradition and
to lose part of this tradi-
tion would be very damag-
ing to the tourist industry.
Great numbers of the
population, particularly
those from the lower paid
sector, depend on these
chippies for large parts of
their diet and to supple-
ment their low income. i
We hope that you will
reply, giving us your
thoughts on this problem.
Yours sincerely,
N . Sayles
President,
Imperial College Union,
P. A . Wadsworth,
Imperial College Union.
We have recently re-
ceived the following reply.
10 Downing Street,
Whitehall.
28 May, 1974.
Dear Mr. Sayles,
The Prime Minister has
asked me to thank you for
your recent letter contain-
ing a motion passed by the
Imperial College Union.
Yours sincerely,
S. F. Wright.
PRATT COMMITTEE
As you may know the
"Pratt Committee", under
the chairmanship of Prof.
Pratt, has been set up to
look into the use of col-
lege facilities by outside
bodies.
Evidence and comments
have been invited from all
sources and below is a
copy of the comments sent
on behalf of I.C. Union.
"The Students' Union has
always taken the view that
it is essential to the aca-
demic work of the College
that there should be ade-
quate provision of non-
academic facilities for all
members of the College
throughout the calendar
year, and that, in particu-
lar, these facilities include
satisfactory catering and
accommodation.
We recognise, however,
that for any organisation
as large as the College, to
close down for part of the
year would be uneconomi-
cal. There will always be a
case for use of college
facilities by "outside bod-
ies" during the vacations.
This constitutes an invalu-
able source of income for
the College, which, if used
to subsidise catering and
residence, directly benefits
students.
Unfortunately, experi-
ence has shown that there
is a conflict between the
necessary provision of faci-
lities for the academic
community and the need
to supplement income in
this fashion. This conflict
is particularly acute in the
areas of accommodation,
catering, and general
maintenance of College
property. Many students
have complained of incon-
venience suffered as a
direct result of this. We
feel that outside bookings
should not be" allowed to
reduce the standards of
facilities offered to mem-
bers of College at any
time.
During vacations, and
conferences, the number
of people using the refec-
tories and bars increases
greatly. This leads to un-
usually long queues. Not
only is this inconvenient,
but it may interfere with
students' academic work.
Clearly, the staff of refec-
tories and bars are occa-
sionally unable to cope
with all the custom, and
students may be the losers
here.
The demand by students
for accommodation, dur-
ing the summer vacations
especially, is largely unsat-
isfied due to the need to
provide accommodation
for conferences and block
bookings. Students who
reside in Hall during the
term, particularly post-
graduates, are extremely
perturbed at having to
move out of their rooms
during the vacations.
The use of the Junior
Common Room for exhi-
bitions is significant only
in that the routine of some
students who use it daily
is disturbed. However,
since common areas in
some departments, for
example Mechanical En-
gineering, are thorough-
fares, there tends to be
even more people wander-
ing through these areas
than is normal.
It has been observed
that conditions during the
summer tend to exacerbate
the effects of chronic un-
derstaffing throughout the
College. This is evident in
refectories and in stan-
dards of maintenance. The
Student Houses, where
many students stay over
the vacation, suffer badly
from a lack of timely re-
pair work.
The Union would like to
see the Union building
used more during vaca-
tions, though it is not pres-
ently clear as to how this
can be achieved.
. The fundamental cause
of any shortfall in the pro-
vision of facilities is, be-
yond doubt, the inade-
quate financial support for
non-academic facilities in
the higher education sec-
tor. Given this, any rec-
ommendations that we
make can only be short-
term solutions.
CONCLUSIONS
1. There appears to be
no comprehensive picture
of the use of the College
at any time. It is not
known whether some areas
are under-used, or could
potentially be used for
another purpose. We
would recommend a de-
tailed survey of all Col-
lege/Departmental / Union
rooms and areas, ascer-
taining their use through-
out the year.
2. The Union feels that
postgraduates who already
reside on campus should
have the right to keep
their rooms during vaca-
tions, irrespective of out-
side bookings.
3. Wherever possible
places should be available
for those postgraduates
who wish to reside on
campus during vacations.
4. It may be necessary,
in future, to provide ex-
clusive catering facilities
for the members of Col-
lege during Conferences. It
may be possible to use the
Union for this purpose."
CONGRATS.
Congratulations to Mr.
Alan Larsen, well known
College Block barman,
and Miss Valerie Scrivens,
on their marriage at St.
Marys, Hayes (near As-
cot) on Saturday.
