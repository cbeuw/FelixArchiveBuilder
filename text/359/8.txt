VACATION BENEFIT
If you are without any financial support for the vacation
(e.g. a job), you are eligible for supplementary benefit.
A LEAFLET GIVING THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET IT IS
BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF ITS
DAVE ASH BY,
Welfare Officer
AVAILABLE NOW IN THE UNION OFFICE.
CONTENTS.

If you are virtually without any financial support
for the vacation, remember that you are eligible, as
a student, to claim supplementary benefit during
the vacations.
There are several types of grant made by Edu-
cation authorities for vacation support and you
should check first that you cannot get any of these.
If you have to do a specific field course or com-
pulsory vacation course, the University is respon-
sible for giving you additional grant. Also, LEAs
have powers to give "discretionary vacation hard-
ship" grants to their award holders in the vacation;
the current maximum is £6.55 per week. LEAs have
their own various and stringent rules about these
and rarely give them—but some local Social Secu-
rity offices tell students to apply first to their LEA
for vacation support before they will award supple-
mentary benefit so you might be saving yourself
time and trouble by getting your LEA's refusal in
good time.
HOW TO GET IT
When you have finished your term and are no
longer required to attend University, you are free
to go to the nearest Local Office of the Department
of Employment and sign on there as available for
work. You can state a preferred type of work and
if it is available, it will be offered to you. If that sort
of job is not available you will have to consider any
job which is not clearly, in the judgment of the
Employment Officer, unsuitable for you by virtue of
your physical weakness, handicap, or some other
reason of that kind. You can insist on a specific
type of job. If there is no work on offer then you«
are entitled to supplementary benefit for any period
of unemployment—this also covers any reasonable
period when you are genuinely pursuing jobs but
turning them down for some valid reason.
You should ask for Form B1 applying for supple-
mentary benefit, and fill it in, indicating if your
need is urgent. The Department of Employment
Local Office may send it on for you, or you can
take it yourself direct to the Department of Health
and Social Security local office, particularly if your
need is urgent. You may have to make an appoint-
ment for your interview with the DHSS and you
should check on this with the Department of Em-
ployment local office.
At the interview with the DHSS local office to
assess your supplementary benefit, you will prob-
ably need to be able to produce documentary evi-
dence, such as your rent book, proof of the dates
of your vacation and terms, details of any income
such as wage slips, receipts for fuel bills, your
bank statements—for instance you may be asked
to prove that you have spent your grant. Always
give accurate information and do not withhold any
details they need to have. You may find that they
visit you—usually within a week—to make their
own assessment of the situation.
A few days later you should receive a statement
of the amount of supplementary benefit awarded;
at the same time the DHSS office will explain the
method—-usually a Giro Cheque cashable at a
specified post office by which it will be paid; and
you will also be told the day and time each week
when you are required to sign on at the Department
of Employment.
HOW MUCH MIGHT IT BE?
The maximum supplementary benefit you can
receive in the vacations depend on a number of
things—your age, where and how you are living,
your savings, various commitments, and so on, the
following is a general rough guide:
(a) If you live at home with your parents in the
vacation you are regarded as a "non-householder";
your maximum personal allowance is £5.70 a week
if you are 18 or more. An additional sum of 80p
per week is also payable to you instead of rent, as
a contribution to your parents rent, etc.
(b) If you live in a bedsit, flat, etc. in the vaca-
tion, where you are responsible for the rent and
household necessities, you are regarded as a
"single-householder"; your maximum personal
allowance is £7.15 a week (£11.65 for a married
couple). An additional sum is payable for the rent.
As a rule you can only claim rent for a flat if you
are actually living there over the vacation period.
APPEALS
If you wish to appeal against the assessment
made by the DHSS, you can do so by writing to
them stating your wish to appeal; you must do this
within 21 days of their decision. At the appeal
tribunal you may call any witness you wish, and
may be represented by anyone whom you consider
qualified to do so. Students are advised to apply
in good time to the NUS Legal A i d fund, where
financial help is needed. Examples of points on
which appeals have been made are: the Social
Security office will assume that you have received
the parental contribution due from your parents
even though you have perhaps never had anything
from them; they will assume that you have actually
had the maximum element of £2.09 a week already
in your grant; you may have an exceptional needs
problem and so on.
The above, which was extracted from "Claim
your vacation Benefit", an NUS pamphlet, gives a
brief outline of the procedures and problems you
will face. Whatever happens remember that supple-
mentary Benefit is something to which you are
entitled, it's not a fiddle.
