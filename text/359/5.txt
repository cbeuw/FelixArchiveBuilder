Postgraduates who supplement their
grants by teaching are being exploited
as cheap labour in many universities.
This is the conclusion of a survey drawn
up for the National Union of Students
by NUS official Jim Mo watt.
Nine institutions pay less than £1 an
hour to postgraduates doing demonstrat-
ing work, the lowest payment in the
country—75p an hour—being made by
Aberystwyth University and Herriot
Watt University in Edinburgh, and the
next lowest—80p an hour—by South-
ampton University.
With two exceptions, Scottish Univer-
sities come out of the survey relatively
well, all paying £1.10 an hour. The two
exceptions are Edinburgh and Herriot
Watt Universities, the two Universities in
Edinburgh, of which Mr. Mowatt says:
"Herriot Watt University . . . has de-
partmental variation between 75p in the
Pharmacy Department, the lowest hourly
rate stated in the U K , and £1.75. in the
Department of Computer Science (one
of the highest). Across 'the street at the
University of Edinburgh demonstrating
rates vary between £1 and £1.60. How-
ever, the rate for tutoring is subject to
even greater variation. The Department
of Nursing Studies, paying Op per hour
is, platitudinously. the lowest in the
academic community, whereas at £4 per
hour, the Social Studies Department
must be regarded as one of the most
munificent of academic employers."
Replies from 55 institutions are sum-
marised in the survey. Some of these in-
stitutions pay a flat annual rate for post-
graduate work, and it is not possible to
compute the rate per hour for these in-
stitutions. Among those which pay by
the hour, 9 institutions pay less than £1;
12 pay between £1 and £1.09; 8 pay be-
tween £1.10 and £1.19; 6 pay between
£1.20 and £1.29; 2 pay between £1.30
and £1.39; one pays between £1.40 and"
£1.49; 7 pay between £1.50 and £1.59.
Six institutions pay more than £1.60, and
four of these pay more than £2.50.
Perhaps surprisingly, all four institu-
tions paying more than £2.50 are Poly-
technics. The lowest-paying institutions
were all Universities, and the highest-
paying institutions were all non-univer-
sities.
NUS Deputy President Alastair Stew-
art commented: "This valuable survey
has confirmed three crucial points.
Firstly, postgraduates are being shame-
lessly exploited and used as cheap
labour. Their institutions are using the
now level of postgraduate grants to get
them to work for well below the rate for
the job. This is bad for everyone: bad
for postgraduates, and bad for the Uni-
versity teachers whose jobs and salaries
are made vulnerable by this practise."
"Secondly, it shows the need for
nationally agreed rates for postgraduate
teaching and demonstrating work. I can
promise post graduate students that the
NUS will make it a priority over the
coming year to achieve this".
. "Thirdly, the survey shows the urgency
for postgraduates to receive a living
grant, so that they are not forced to take
work at exploitive rates. I hope that the
living grant which NUS has demanded
for postgraduates—£1025 a year—will be
agreed by the Government after the re-
view of postgraduate grants in which it
is now engaged."
Union General Awards
and social colours
Nominations are in-
vited for both of the
above.
Union General Awards
are the top honour that
the Union can award and
there are rarely more
than six awarded in any
one year. The decision
on these nominations lies
with the President, Norm
Sayles. If you think you
know of someone who
deserves one of these
awards then write, de-
tailing the person's con-
tribution to the Union,
to the President, care of
the Union Office. Please
mark your envelope with
U.G.A. in the top left-
hand corner. Remember,
to have a hope of win-
ning one of these the
person nominated must
have done, to put it
mildly, "a h"*l of a lot
of work."
Union Social Colours
are a lower level award
for those who have spent
an exceptional amount
of time and effort work-
ing for the Union. These
are awarded by the Col-
ours Committee. Nomin
ation for social colours
arising out of work for
an RCC, SCC or ACC
club, and various other
Union bodies come dir-
ect from those bodies
and nominations should
in the first case, be ad-
dressed to these. There
are, however, people
who just do general
work and need separate
nominations. If you wish
to nominate members
for Social Colours write
to Paul Wadsworth, c/o
The Union Office, and
mark your envelope
"Social Colours." Nomi-
nations closing date has
been extended till this
Thursday.
D R A M A F E S T I V A L
The NUS will take part in the Sunday
Times drama festival in April, 1975, but
only on condition that it is represented
on adjudication and selection panels, a
one-day conference of N U S drama soci-
ety delegates decided.
There were about 25 present at the
conference, and they recommended that
there should be an advisory panel of
students to represent student interest in
the organisation of the festival. Fourteen
delegates and one member of the NUS
Executive were elected on to the panel.
The matter of the drama festival
arose at the NUS Easter conference,
when the executive's decision to boycott
the festival was referred back. The
executive decision was taken in April
1973 and was the culmination of growing
dissent between the NUS and the Sunday
Times over the way the festival was run.
The trouble started when the Sunday
Times took over complete organisation
of the festival in 1968.
NUS set up a working party in 1970
to examine the role and form of the
festival. Students felt the newspaper dom-
inated the festival and that not enough
experimental and workshop drama was
shown. They also objected to the com-
petitive aspect of the festival.
Other recommendations were that an
analysis of all the entries should be
made at the end of the festival. All areas
of drarrta should be represented, includ-
ing workshop, and a wide range of col-
leges should he represented with a
weighting in favour of smaller colleges.
The NUS should advise on publicity
for the festival (the conference felt the
NUS would be more likely to know than,
the Sunday Times what means would be
successful), and in any publicity the
name of NUS should appear as a joint
co-sponsor with the Sunday Times.
The recommendations have been
broadly accepted by the NUS executive.
If the interests of the N U S are not suffi-
ciently met by the newspaper, it will
withdraw as co-sponsors.
SCAB Elections
At the last SCAB meeting it was decided to elect
a Secretary and Assistant Secretary in order to aid
the functioning of SCAB, and take some of the work
load off the Chairman.
The Chairman, Secretary, Assistant Secretary and'
Senior Treasurer will form the Executive of SCAB,
as is the case with the other major sub-committees.
The job of secretary will involve the usual things,
helping the Chairman, doing the paperwork, keeping
the minutes, producing bumpf etc. The Assistant Sec-
retary will help out, keep the diary of events, send out
notices to members, produce bumpf etc. In fact any-
thing that needs doing for SCAB that the Chairman
can con them into doing.
So what are the qualifications and qualities for
these posts. Few, in fact. Any member of Imperial
College Union can stand, all they need is a proposer,
two seconders and a desire to do the job. The election
will take place at the A G M of SCAB, to take place
at 6.00 p.m. on Friday the 7th June in Room at the
Top. Persons able to vote at this event are the outgoing
and incoming members of the SCAB committee, al-
though all Union members are able to attend as
observers.
Those wishing to join in the running of SCAB, and
becoming either Secretary, Assistant Secretary, should
complete the nomination forms in the Lower Union
Lounge. Nominations will close on Friday, 7th June
at 5.00 p.m.
For additional details see Phil Starkey, Weeks 63, or
Dave Rumsey, Weeks 38 or try the Union office.

During the vacation a large proportion of those people with official permits leave
the college (either for the vacations or for good). This means that there are often
large numbers of spare parking places available.
THOSE WITH P E R M I T S STILL C O N T I N U E T O H A V E FIRST PRIORITY
FOR P L A C E S .
However, during the long vacation any student may park in the students areas.
This applies to the student areas only. The remainder of the places are distributed
amongst the staff and college officials and must not be used by students. Shown
here is a brief diagram of the student parking areas.
For those that wish to have a parking pennit for next year, the application forms
should be available in July.

THOSE
WERE
THE
DAYS
Dug from the deepest
depths of the Union's files
a document entitled
"Union House Commit-
tee: ' Notes of require-
ments" has been unearth-
ed. This referred ito a ser-
ies of renovations to vari-
ous Union rooms. It is
dated from about March,
1955. I print some brief
extracts:
Bar Uses:— (a) Drink-
ing. Singing. Dart-playing.
Horse-play (b) Housing
and displaying pewter
tankards.
Note: Women not ad-
mitted.
All furniture should be
proof against violent as-
sault.
Recommendations: —
(h) Concealed (and beer-
proot) lighting.
Lobby To be provided
with:— (d) Since women
will enter the lobby to ex-
amine the noticeboards, a
baffle screen should be
placed before the men's
lavatory door.
Ground floor lounge
Uses:— (c) waiting for.
meciing and entertaining
guests, particularly ladies •
on dance nights.
(d) a radio is installed
mainly to provide back-
ground noise—it is impor-
tant only on such occa-
sions as test matches.
Of the whole Union this
lounge is the room most
likely to be most frequen-
ted and suffers the most
wear. The furnishings
must accordingly be ro-
bust (and beer-proof).
Thr, is the students' home
from home; the institu-
tional atmosphere must
be avoided.
ICWA Lounge 6. Suffi-
cient power for:—2. fires,
standard lamp, electric
iron. vacuum cleaner,
electric clock. 3. table
lamos, light for sewing
machine.
Suggested furnishings :
4. Fine net curtains at
north windows. A i l cur-
to reach floor. 13, Mirror
