JAMES LAST
Non-Stop Dancing
Volume 15-
Well he's done it yet again! — The
Count Basie of Bremen — James Last
(brother of that other superstar Kai
Warner) comes up with another selec-
tion of popular tunes played in his own
inimitable style.
This album was released to tie-in
with Last's triumphant return to Bri-
tain this year, which included three sell
out concerts at the Albert Hall. Perhaps
the 'freaks' who organize entertainment
in the college could cater for the taste
of the majority of students for a change
(we're not all into Man and Uriah
Beep) and try and book the James Last
Orchestra (and Singers) for the Fresh-
ers Concert in October — a definite
sell out, I'm sure.
All the tracks (27 in all) on this selec-
tion are even now being accepted as
the standards of the seventies. These
include the two fabulous Slade tracks—
'S'kweeze Me, Pleeze Me', and 'My
Friend Stan,' and for all you glitter fans
T'm the Leader of the Gang', lis also
included. I'm certain Mick Jagger and
Keith Richard really intended 'Angie'
to be orchestrated in this way.
This must be the record to have at all
your parties this summer, even if you
do have volumes one to fifteen already.
However, for people just starting a
James Last collection, I have a slight
preference for 'Non Stop Dancing Vol-
ume Ten', which includes 'Na Na Hey
Hey Kiss Him Goodbye,' and that other
super 'rave from the grave' — 'Geh
Aite, Schau, Mi Net So Teppert An'.

WHITNEY
Streetwalkers
Roger Chapman and Charlie Whit-
ney were vocalist and guitarist respec-
tively with the now defunct Family and
iit was almost inevitable that their first
album as Chapman : Whitney would
be almost like a Family remake.
This is not quite so. "Streetwalkers",
the album in question, does, to a cer-
tain extent, have a "Family" feel about
it, but not so much as to make you
think that it is just them.
On looking through the lyric sheet
you find that most of them refer to
what could be regarded as streetwalkers
— prostitutes, dirty old man, former
beauty queen—whether they are inten-
ded to be a reflection on today's society
I don't know. None of them could be
regarded as happy songs.
Roger sounds as though he has been
taking an extended mouthwash. A lot
of the harshness he had with Family
seems to have disappeared leaving a
very clear, distinct voice which gives
great feeling to the lyrics.
Charlie's guitar work is steady
enough. Not flashy, not too outstand-
ing but technically perfect, and quite
capable of coming into its own when
necessary.
It is Roger's vocals, however, that
are the highlight of this really excellent
album. It is really a shame that so few
albums of this quality are produced.
THREE
MAN ARMY
Three Man
Army Two
Containing former members of Gun.
Parrish & Gurvitz and the Jeff Beck
Group one would obviously expect
Three Man Army's new album "Three
Man Army Two" to contain really
heavy rock and this is exactly what you
get.
Outstanding on this album is the
guitar work of Adrian Curtis, playing
lead and slide. Track two. "Today",
written by himself is a prime example.
It is laid back just to the right amount
so that it doesn't overpower the remain-
der of ihe band, and this is so through-
out the album. Curtis has also managed
to write some really excellent music
like "Space in the Place". Full backing
treatment is given to this with strings
and piano, producing a sound very
similar to the Electric Light Orchestra.
There are several mood changes on
this album, the first two tracks on side
2 showing this to the full. The first is
very hard driving, extremely fast instru-
mental, showing Curtis' guitar work and
Tony Newman's drumming. Track two
is much more flowing, easy going.
String and horn backings again, with
vocal support from Doris Troy and
Madelin Bell, leading to a "switch-off"
fade-out and straight into another driv-
ing, attacking number in which Paul
Gurvitz's bass work is allowed more
prominence.
The production work, by the band
and Cyrano, is also very good. Through-
out the album no one instrument is
allowed to completely drown out any of
the backing. Very well mixed and a
pleasure to listen to.
A really good album and they should
do well for themselves. They certainly
deserve to with this album.
BUCKLEY
T o n t o
Well, well, and people wonder why
irnre is a vinyl and cardboard shortage.
The reason is because it is wasted on
albums like this one. "Set'ronia" by
Tim Buckley.
Crooning, as if trying to do very bad
imitations of Tom Jones and Frank
Ifield at the same time, he has man-
aged to produce 37 minutes and 55 sec-
onds (as supplied by the record cover)
of quite unforgetable music. Unforget-
able due to its atrocity.
Portsmouth Sinfonia, famous for
throwing out musicians when they can
play their instruments, ought to take
him on as a permanent member, though
he'd probably put the rest out of work.
Final comment: avoid it like the pla-
gue and the clap combined.
THEATRE
SHAW
K i n g ;
What must be the most unusual ren-
dering of the Arthurian legends is pre-
sently showing alt the Shaw Theatre,
Euston Road. It is in the form of a
light-hearted musical (?!) comedy cal-
led, simply, "The King," (by David
Cregan), and revolves mainly around
the sex-life (or lack of it from Arthur)
of the knights in the legends.
Geoffrey Hutchings. as Arthur gives
an excellent rendering and is ably sup-
ported by the other leading players (Jon
Parker as Merlin, Neil McCaul as
Launcelot, Alison Steadiman as Guine-
vere). The remaining 16 supporting
players are not at all outstanding ex-
cepting the archbishop, played by
Charles McKeown, who could easily
double for Marty Feldman.
The play tries to show that the trou-
bles experienced in Arthur's time stem-
med from the fact that he was sexually
incapable. This leads to Launcelot being
portrayed not just as Guinevere's lover
but as a compulsive necnophiliac, and
Arthur being unsuccessfully seduced by
Morgan le Fay (Elizabeth Ward) por-
trayed as an undersexed redheaded sex
bomb.
What made the play were the sets,
designed by Tim Goodehild. A basi-
cally bare, sloped stage with simple
props (throne, round table, bed) being
moved on and off behind fairy-tale
canvasses lowered onto the stage. These
were excellent and it was unfortunate
that the play was not up to the sets.
They have inserted a crowd puller in
the form of a full frontal nudity scene
between Launcelot and a female,
Elaine (Joanna Tope) after having had
an unsuccessful bed session. Well, I
suppose there had to be some point of
interest in the play.
A light-hearted play, good for a
laugh or two, but not exactly the most
enthralling piece on the London stage
Note: Due to bad reviews from the
critics, Shaw theatre have now made
entrance free for this play.

Freedom
This book, written on request from
the Council for Academic Freedom, is
essentially an attack on the present
hierarchal structure of tertiary educa-
tional institutions, with emphasis on the
university sector. The author corre-
lates the authoritarian trends in soci-
ety with the repressive measures which
appear to be becoming more frequent-
ly taken against both dissenting staff
and students. We all support academic
freedom, says Arblaster, but freedom
for whom?
"Some have been quick to cry out
in defence of academic freedom when
professors, or MPs, have been shouted
down, or even simply heckled, by stu-
dent audiences, but they have remained
silent when radical or dissident staff
have been victimised or have lost their
jobs—a much more serious penalty."
By the use of many case histories this
book shows that, or attempts to show,
that academic freedom is being strang-
led by, or abused by, the senior aca-
demics and administrators by their
refusal to listen to suggestions or de-
mands from radical staff or students.
He maintains that the arrogance of
these men leaves little room for debate
about the proper methods of learning.
He gives Sir Michael Swann, the former
Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh, as an
example of one of these men, and one
can only bring to mind the lack of
respect for him of his students.
This book pays little attention to the
student who wants to be educated to
a particular profession such as engin-
eering. The author recognises none of
the benefits which may be derived from
a connection with industry, for example,
and only stresses the dangers of such
arrangements. He decries absolutely the
acceptance of Ministry of Defence
grants (Heriot-Watt receives very little
from the M.o.D. e.g. £10,000 under the
direction of Mr. A. N. Dickson, Dept.
of Mech. Eng.).
Despite, or because of this, depend-
ing on your point of view, the left wing
bias of this book it is an excellent
documentation of academic suppression
in the last few years and provides a
penetrating analysis of many of the
problems in the universities and colleges
today. Paperback, price 50p, Penguin.
