IC Rugby loses to Medics
in Varsity match... yet again
The stage was set. The script was written. The Imperial Medicals’
forgot to read the last act, however. Having gained promotion to
the same division that the Medicals almost got relegated from this
season, Imperial College looked set to cause the biggest upset
ever in Varsity history by beating the Medicals for the first time
since the annual showdown began in 2003. After 80 minutes the
match was tied 19-19 but during extra time the Medicals kicked
a penalty, taking the lead for the first time in the match. Imperial
College failed to respond and the game ended 22-19; the Medicals
were victorious. Oh well, there’s always next year. Chins up

Union Sabbatical Officers and elec-
tion candidates collectively breathed
a sign of relief at midnight on Tuesday
evening when the voting period for the
2008 Union Elections ended.
This year’s elections saw an impres-
sive turnout of voters with 14,872 votes
cast in total. The Presidential race at-
tracted the most voters: 2,474 in total
or 18.5%. 13,348 people were eligible
to vote. Between 1,950 and 2,200 votes
were cast in every other strand, includ-
ing the NUS Delegate and Student
Trustee Board categories.
Hopefully the results will be an-
nounced on Monday, farce permitting.
It’s traditional for the candidates to file
a few complaints against their com-
petitors, usually related to emailing list
abuse, tearing down posters or cam-
paigning in the vicinity of a computer.
Who’ll actually win the elections is
anyone’s guess. This year’s field com-
prises very few newcomers to the fun
and games of Union politics, and even
the Union’s wisest hacks can’t provide
the answers to the $64,000 questions.
Tune in next week for the results folks
(fingers/toes crossed etc)!
