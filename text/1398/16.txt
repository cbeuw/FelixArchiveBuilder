I
am not a portrait person. I much
prefer my landscapes. Give me
cows, grass, rolling hills, and
sheds any day. Not today. I was
not in the mood to stand in a
room and to be watched by people
sulkily staring out of their portraits at
my poor taste in jumpers. Maybe that
statement is a little self-centred but
that is genuinely how I felt about the
Photographic Portrait Prize Exhibition
this year. It neither inspired nor inter-
ested me…
The Photographic Portrait Prize an-
nually showcases the work of very tal-
ented photographers, be they amateur
or professional. The standard of pho-
tography was mostly very high. For
others, I couldn’t see any real talent.
There was an over-abundance of girls
standing in generic blank locations,
pouting. There was no particular emo-
tion you could read on their faces and
no story behind the portrait, as the
blurb suggested. It was just a portrait,
and certainly didn’t deserve to be in
the National Portrait Gallery, in with a
chance of a prize.
Thankfully, it wasn’t all dull and
homogenous. The strange light ef-
fects present in some of the portraits
were rather intriguing, and when this
is done well in black and white, it is
really impressive. There is a brilliant
black and white of Ian McKellen look-
ing very tired, bored, and in need of a
good shag.
The best portraits, I thought, were
the ones in which the subject was ac-
tively doing something and not just
posing for a camera. When we go out
armed with our cameras, the best pho-
tos are always the ones where we have
caught people off their guard. These
are always the most unusual. It was the
same with the PP Prize. The most char-
acteristic faces were caught in spon-
taneous shots. One that particularly
caught my eye was the small Ukrainian
boy during his break in a boxing class
looking haggard and old, despite being
only 11 years old.
I was thankful that the winner of the
£12,000 prize had not just portrayed
his grumpy girlfriend in suburban
London. Jonathan Torgovnik showed
Joseline Ingabire, a victim of rape
during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
Photographed with her two children,
born at the height of the conflict, the
portrait explored the terrible impact
of the atrocities of war. He used the
photographic medium in the best
way possible to raise awareness of the
plight of thousands of women abused
in Rwanda.
So there were a couple of interesting
portraits. Not enough to merit a visit
to Trafalgar Square, however. I would
recommend taking a look at the rest of
the gallery as well. I hadn’t been to the
NPG before, for reasons stated previ-
ously. I quite liked the space – wide,
open, and blank – as it served as a good
canvas for the portraits.
I really liked the shop – this was one
of the highlights of my visit. They sold
sufficient quirky bits and bobs and ex-
cellent coffee-table books. I was sur-
prised at how reasonable the prices
were compared to the extortionate
prices at our local V&A – £10 for a
crap pencil, anyone?
On heading to the bookshop down-
stairs for solace after the disappoint-
ing Portrait Prize I found a small ex-
hibition: Shutting Up Shop. Despite its
gloomy outlook on the future of Brit-
ain’s independent shops, this exhibi-
tion lifted my mood considerably.
In 1972, photographer John Londei
started taking pictures of small inde-
pendent shops the length and breadth
of Britain. These were often family-
run businesses, well-established in
their local communities: the butchers
and bakers, button makers, cobblers,
fishmongers, and chemists of our high
streets.
Over a fifteen-year period, he pho-
tographed 60 shops. In 2004, when
he retraced his steps and revisited the
shops he’d photographed, finding only
seven of the 60 were still in business.
Small thumbnails on the blurb show
us that these shops have now been re-
placed by ‘Delight Kebab’ or a Marks
and Spencer.
Proud proprietors are pictured out-
side their enterprises, such as Frank
Gedge, owner of a contraceptives shop
opened in Stoke-on-Trent in 1935.
Feast your eyes on that! An entire shop
of condoms! Zip-up, spray-on, extra
large, midget willy, armored truck…
In fact all the portraits are as fascinat-
ing as this – the old, jumbled, friend-
ly independent shops of 1972 show
real charisma along with their proud
owners.
Most of the shops that closed could
not survive when larger chains and
supermarkets exponentially increased
the competition. Why go to individual
dirty, muddled shops when your local
Tesco stocks the same for half the price
and half the quality?
Have faith, however. In 1972, John
Londei photographed a couple who
owned a shack on the Isle of Lewis in
the Outer Hebrides. They sold home-
made Harris Tweed. The portrait
shows them stuck in the middle of
nowhere with just a telephone box for
company … and they are still at it.
Shutting Up Shop is a real gem, por-
traying people proud of what they did.
A long way from the meaningless por-
traits upstairs in the PP Prize, this ex-
hibition shows something of substance.
Something that is perhaps lacking in
today’s consumerist society.
Fortunately, the Photographic
Portrait Prize exhibition ended on
24th February. Shutting Up Shop
is still on, however, until 5th May
in the Bookshop Gallery. Admis-
sion is free.
