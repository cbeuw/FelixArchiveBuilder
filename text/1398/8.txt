F
elix Politics is visiting each
and every corner of the globe
in order to bring the pre-
dominately godless commu-
nity of Imperialites the most
pressing of news stories. This week
features bananas, genocide, gambling,
election rigging and invasions. And in
case you didn’t know what the world
look like, we’ve included a map.
Culture minister Andy Burnham last
week confirmed that the govern-
ment’s plan for Super Casinos across
the UK have been shelved. The
scheme, drawn up by Labour under
Tony Blair with the goal of boost-
ing tourism and investment, espe-
cially in the north of the country, has

has already stated that he intends
to take up the role of prime min-
ister in the new Kremlin adminis-
tration. It is widely accepted that
Mr Putin will still hold the reins of
power in the former Soviet Union,
and many international observers,
mostly in western Europe and the
USA, fear his increasingly asser-
tive and hostile foreign policy will
lead to a new ‘Cold War’.
A former secret service agent,
Putin has overseen significant eco-
nomic recovery since the days of
high inflation and currency fears
at the end of the 1990’s. Many in
the country feel that he has re-
stored Russia’s pride and place on
the international stage. However,
his Presidency has seen a dete-
rioration of relations with NATO
countries over missile projects,
exiles in the UK suspected of
conspiring against the Russian
government, gas supplies to the
EU, and most recently, the state of
Kosovo which declared independ-
ence from Serbia last week.
Russia to vote on March 2nd
The election of President Umaru
Yar’Adua was upheld last Tuesday
in a ruling by a tribunal, following
allegations of ‘massive’ vote rig-
ging by opposition leaders. They
have said they wish to appeal to the
Supreme Court, a process which
could take months. He succeeded
President Olusegun Obasanjo as
a hand-picked candidate in 2007,
promising to reform what many
regard as an under-performing
economy and tackle corruption in
the world’s 8th largest exporter of
oil.

Thousands of Turkish troops have
been sent into the northern region
of Iraq in the latest attempt to root
out Kurdish separatists, advanc-
ing as far as 30km into its neigh-
bour’s sovereign territory. Kurds,
who form a distinct ethnic group,
straddle the Turkey–Iraq border
and have campaigned for inde-
pendence since colonialism ended
last century. The PKK, the main
political force of the Kurds, are
said to have been behind several
attacks on bases along the fron-
tiers. “The cabinet expressed its
rejection and condemnation for
the Turkish military interference,
which is considered a violation of
Iraq’s sovereignty” read a state-
ment by Iraq’s parliament. Ankara
fears a weak Baghdad government
will allow more autonomy for
the Kurds, perhaps leading to a
breakaway state of Kurdistan and
the possibility of taking some land
from Turkey.
Fairtrade, the foundation which
buys produce at what it deems ethi-
cal prices, is running ‘Fairtrade Fort-
night’ to promote awareness and ed-
ucation regarding the plight of many
farmers across the world who suffer
under the current trading regimes
as well as local laws. Suppliers such
as Kagera Coffee Union, a coffee
company in Tanzania, can expect to
benefit greatly from the premiums
consumers in the UK are willing to
pay for peace of mind. However, the
label ‘Fairtrade’, which itself pulls
sales in excess of £500m, has drawn
criticism from leading economists
who regard it as no more than a fad,
like organic food, targeting what are
in the main Liberal Democrat voting
suburbanites with cash to (meta-
phorically) splash. Furthermore, it
is claimed that the practices of Fair-
trade the foundation actually create
more economic injustice by favour-
ing a handful of ‘certified’ grow-
ers, taking emphasis away from fair
The New York Philharmonic Or-
chestra arrived in Pyong Yang last
Monday for a 3-day tour. It was the
first cultural exchange between
the two Cold War foes who do not
hold any official ties. The Reuters
news agency reported “the biggest
U.S. group to visit since the 1950-
53 Korean War”.
Despite the absence from the
concert of the Communist State’s
leader Kim Jong Il, the event marks
a significant improvement in rela-
tions between the two countries
since North Korea was believed
to have tested a nuclear weapon
in 2006.
What is often touted as the great-
est sporting event in the world, the
Olympic Games, which this year will
be hosted in Beijing, has come under
renewed political attention after the
famous Hollywood director Steven
Spielberg declined a role as an Ar-
tistic Advisor. He said “I find that
my conscience will not allow me to
continue business as usual”, referring
to China’s backing of a Sudanese
government accused of genocide.
Crackdowns on anti-democracy
protests in another State with strong
economic links with China, Myan-
mar, has also been used by various
groups including the ‘88 Generation
Students’ as a reason to boycott the
summer extravaganza. China’s For-
eign Minister Liu Jian Chao insisted

the government has gone to great
lengths to ensure the Games’ suc-
cess. Lui Gui Jin, special envoy to
Darfur, last week urged Khartoum to
cooperate with the UN hybrid peace-
keeping mission, a move touted as
‘significant’ by David Miliband.
China also maintains that its policy
is aimed at developing and improv-
ing living standards. The country
itself has seen consistent breakneck
growth over the last decade, lift-
ing nearly half a billion people from
abject poverty. Furthermore, it
highlights the hypocrisy of already
wealthy nations which prop up re-
gimes such as the house of Saud,
not especially praised for its human
rights, and claim the focus on Sudan
and Myanmar are a way of under-
mining the government in Beijing.

to be debated at World Trade talks.
