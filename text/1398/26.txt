the scene do I actually measure? How
far away is it all? What do I focus on?
Do I sacrifice image quality and depth
of field (how much is in focus) for a
shorter exposure time, so the guy quiv-
ering behind the camera doesn’t churn
out shaky shots, one after another?
The compact camera decides all that
and more by itself. And so will a DSLR,
if you put it in Auto mode. But as soon
as you start to explore the semi-auto-
matic and manual settings, you’ll find
out that your expensive black paper-
weight will do wonderful things. This
creative control is what makes the dif-
ference between a snap and a photo in
Felix that makes people go ‘wow’.
Right… I get it. So what does SLR
mean? Geekery can be skipped. SLR
stands for Single Lens Reflex. It means
that when you look through the view-
finder, you’re actually looking through
the lens. What you see is what you get.
The screen doesn’t show anything un-
til you’ve taken a photo, but that’s OK
because the viewfinder gives you more
detail than a preview screen anyway.
All SLRs have interchangeable lenses.
I’ve decided! What now? Mention
DSLR to a Currys salesman. Go on,
try it: a loud bell will ring, and lots of
balloons with “Canon” and “Nikon”
printed on them will float down from
the ceiling.
Canon and Nikon have produced
brilliant cameras since time began,
and have the lion’s share of the con-
sumer DSLR market. Pentax, Sony,
and Olympus make consumer DSLRs
too. All have their strengths and weak-
nesses, but nowadays, they’re all good.
In fact, the top five manufacturers’
newest consumer DSLRs are so good,
it doesn’t matter which one you buy:
you’ll still take great photos. But you
mustn’t choose indiscriminately; they
each have a character of their own, and
there’ll be one that feels right at home
lying dreamily against your chest. Go
to an independent camera shop, such
as Spectrum (see below). They’ll let you
have a grope of every camera you can
buy, talk about what you’d like them to
do, and even take them onto the pave-
ment to have a go with each one.
There are other categories of DSLR
on the market: ‘prosumer’ and profes-
sional. As you’re a student, I’ll assume
that, like me, you can’t afford a ‘pro-
sumer’ DSLR. Remember about the
lens: with a cheap lens, you’ll get pic-
tures just as good from putting it on a
consumer DSLR body as a professional
body. Save your pennies and buy lenses
that will run the bath – your photos
will thank you.
To give you an idea of what there is,
here’s a rundown of each of the con-
sumer DSLRs on the market.
Canon 400D: 10 megapixels. My
opinion: Extremely popular, reliable
camera. The selection of lenses is un-
rivalled. However, it feels plasticky and
ugly to me.
Nikon D40, D40x: 6, 10 megapix-
els respectively. My opinion: Popular
cameras, very comfy and extremely
light. Unfortunately, lens compatibility
(even with Nikon lenses) is mediocre.
Try the more expensive but brilliant
D80 (or older D70 or D50) for full
compatibility.
Pentax K100D Super: 6 megapixels,
Shake Reduction. My opinion: Build
quality is amazing – can be dropped
off buildings. Shake Reduction is a life-
saver, all the time. New Pentax lenses
aren’t ubiquitous like Canon or Nikon
lenses, but there are literally thousands
of old, cheap Pentax lenses that fit and
give picture quality rivalling the most
expensive new ones.
Sony α 200: 10 megapixels, Shake
Reduction. My opinion: An average
DSLR – it’ll take good pictures, but it’s
not hugely popular. Shake reduction
(“SteadyShot”) is a good thing.
Olympus e-410: 10 megapixels, Live
View. My opinion: A good performer
with a slightly strange grip. It’s light-
weight and comfortable, nonetheless,
and well worth considering.
Lenses. This may be a bit of a bomb-
shell. You’ll go and splash out on a
beautiful camera, take it home, and
wonder why it’s got a big hole in the
front. I’m afraid lenses come separate-
ly. This makes sense: why should they
supply the same lens with each camera
if everyone’s going to take pictures of
different things?
Fortunately, if you ask nicely, you’ll
be sold a basic all-purpose lens, called
a kit lens, with the camera. Typically
this is an 18-55mm zoom lens. That
means that it goes from wide-angle to
a little bit telephoto (zoomed in), and
you get the same sort of zoom range
as on a typical compact camera. Here’s
the good news: While all lenses cost
quite a bit of money on their own, a kit
lens might only add £30 to the price of
the camera. Accept the kit lens, use the
camera, and after a few months, you’ll
know what kind of lens would be best
for you next. It’s a personal choice!
This is how lenses differ. A lens is
known by its focal length. 50mm, 18-
55mm, 70-200mm. This simply means
how close it gets to something far away.
200 or 300mm is good for perving (or
nature photography), 35mm is about
the field of view of the human eye, and
15mm is really wide-angle and good for
landscapes or fat people. Clearly, a lens
called ’18-55mm’ will zoom between
18mm and 55mm, when you turn the
zoom ring. A lens called ‘50mm’ won’t
zoom, and is thus called a ‘prime lens’.
Prime lenses are compact and tend to
take beautiful, sharp pictures, but don’t
have much flexibility. You’ll just have to
run forwards and backwards instead.
The other vital statistic for lenses is
the maximum aperture size. Aperture
size is represented by an ‘F-number’.
In practice: a low F-number means the
camera can open the aperture really
wide and let lots of light in for non-
shaky photos in low light (a ‘fast lens’).
A higher F-number means it can’t let
as much light in. Kit lenses are not fast;
fast lenses are expensive but worth it.
To give you some context: most kit
lenses will open up to about f/4, a re-
ally slow lens is f/6.3, and a really fast
lens is f/1.7.
There are various special lenses
available, at a premium. Fisheye lenses
are good for taking weird curvy pic-
tures of buildings, or for giving people
HUGE noses. Macro lenses will focus
on things really close, so you can see
deep into a fly’s soul.
Of course, there’s quality. The differ-
ence between two seemingly identical
lenses costing £80 and £2,000 will be in
the image quality, and the build qual-
ity too. The more expensive one will
give you pictures with impact, beauti-
ful contrast and colours, and no weird
distortions or strange effects. It’ll also
be made nearly entirely of metal, with
weather seals and lovely gooey zoom
and focus rings, and will be sex to hold.
The £80 one will still do anyone’s pho-
tography justice, though. Kit lenses fall
into the category of most basic, get-
you-from-A-to-B lenses – apart from
the Pentax 18-55mm kit lens, which is
outstanding next to the other manu-
facturers’ kit lenses.
Canon 400D: The most popular beginner DSLR there is
Price. Assuming I’ve sold it to you,
you’re itching to know if you can afford
this garden of delights. SLR photogra-
phy is much cheaper than it used to be,
but it’ll still cost you a month’s rent to
get started. If you go to the right plac-
es, you can get a comprehensive starter
kit – camera, kit lens, memory card,
bag, even a basic tripod, for £400 to
£450. For an idea, browse Warehouse
Express (URL below). But don’t splash
out before you’ve had a feel, and sup-
port the independent shops.
Finally. Once you’re into DSLR pho-
tography, there’s no way out. It’s fan-
tastic fun and a great way to get no-
ticed and published. The possibilities
really are endless. To give yourself an
