Fun & Games
Virgo
This week, whilst on
vacation in Alaska,
you come across
a herd of giant
scorpion. A herd.
Antelopes gallop
after them like on some pseudo-earth where
brunettes are considered more attractive than
blondes and people with red-hair are heralded
as Presidents and Prime Ministers. A sharp
scorpion barb pierces your left ventricle. Your
right packs its bags and sends you packing. Er.
Scorpio
This week you
develop an
unhealthy pen
fettish. Their
smooth, glossy
surface and gently
curved barrel compel you to caress it. The
simple clicking, in-out, in-out motion appeals
to your senses of touch and sound. The sticky,
sweet smell of blue ink flows across your
textured fingers and dribbles slowly into the
crease between your nail and skin. Heaven.
Libra
This week you get
a High Barnet. The
hairdresser says
you’re his favourite
customer yet; a real
Angel. He invites
you to dinner at his Mansion House. On your
way, you walk through a Green Park. From the
corner of your eye you see the glimmer of a
gun, from which a bullet flies into your Temple.
Sagittarius
This week your
spouse redecorates
your flat with regal
wallpaper. Walking
through the front
door, your irrational
fear of wallpaper strikes rendering you a wob-
bling, wibbling, jelly mess on the doormat.
Your significant other offers you a hand-up
but her patchwork, Camden-market bought
skirt resembles the original offender. Your left
foot twitches kicking her in the clunge.
Capricorn
This week, you will
walk in to college
and find yourself
surrounded by
tiny children. They
declare you their
king and insist you marry their princess. Not
wanting to offend, you accept. I bet you like
the sound of that you fucking paedo scumbag,
“marrying” a tiny child. You make me sick.
Cancer
Despite all your
searching for
new sensations
amongst the Disney
paraphenalia, you
still cannot recreate
the sensation Beaker gave you. One night, you
light some candles and make love to Beaker.
Upon climax you realise you have your dick
inside a child’s toy and have never felt worse.
Gemini
However, Beaker’s
hair tuft rubs
up against your
testicles and you
feel an unusual
sensation. You
enjoy it too much you think. So later this
week you revisit the muppet doll to see if
this sensation wasn’t a fluke. It wasn’t. Oh it
wasn’t. You develop an unusual addiction to
various cuddly toys from the Disney Store
investigating their pleasure-giving properties.
Leo
An argument has
erupted in the office
about the aesthetics
and usefulness of
wind turbines. I’m
going to strap Greg,
Andrew and Matty to the blades of a turbine,
crank dat dynamo and let the fun begin. Roll
up, roll up! Place your bets! 5-1 for Andrew
to soar through the sky first and crash into
the nearest cliff-face resulting in mega-insta-
death.
Taurus
This week you just
did a little pooh in
your pants – it stung
a little. You have run
out of toilet paper
and having put all
your towels in the wash you have to resort to
your muppet replica. It’s fucking Beaker. Here
is your dilemma, do you waddle along to the
shop and buy some toilet paper or wipe your
arse with a muppet? You choose the latter and
utilise his hair-tuft to sanitise yourself.
Aries
Izzle kizzle, fo’
schizzle. My nizzle,
what you sizzle?
Fo’ schizzle bizzle,
ha ha.
S-N-double-O-P
D-O-double-gi-zee, D-O-double-gi-zee, D-O-
double-gi-zee! S-N-double-O-P D-O-double-
gi-zee, D-O-double-gi-zee, D-O-double-gi-
zee! Hollerrrrrrr!
Pisces
Next week you
win some student
election that people
really don’t care
about that much.
You’ll probably
jump for joy but the realisation will dawn on
you that you hate this institution and then
you’ll seek out the nearest car exhaust pipe to
inhale the intoxicating fumes. A painful, slow,
drawn out death involving you stumbling over
land-mines will ensue.

Needy McNeedy: helping since the last recession
W
hat is the use in
me having all this
wisdom if it can’t
be dispensed to
you, the undeserv-
ing general public? I believe I was put
upon this planet for a purpose, and
that purpose is clear: to sort all your
problems out. Yes, that’s ALL your
problems. Apart from Angry Geek and
Horoscope guy, the both of you need
a whole newspaper dedicated to your
issues. The rest of you: email agony.

Dear Needy Mc Needy
I’m a bit short of money this term, and
last weekend I went shopping. I bought
some cheap shoes from H&M and they
don’t fit me. I can’t take them back as I
ripped the tags off but I can’t stop think-
ing about the money I’ve wasted. I might
as well have ripped up the bank notes.
How can I get over my bad purchase?
Theyweregreywedges
Dear Theyweregreywedges
Everyone finds that at some point in
their life, they make mistakes. Some
people commit genocide, some take
drugs, and you, my self-indulgent
reader, chose to buy unsuitable shoes.
Get a grip. In the history of mistakes
yours features so small it doesn’t even
make the Planck length. I suggest a
liberal dose of reality; stop worrying
about the shoes or that annoying bit
of hair which won’t stay in place and
try taking notice of somebody else for
once. Even if it is just your equally self-
obsessed best friend (she might even
thank you for it).

Dear Needy Mc Needy
I’ve started having a recurring dream
in which I’m in a stationary shop and
can’t choose what to buy. It started off
a couple of months ago and I laughed
it off but then it’s come back and now I
dream it every single night. I’ve started
staying up late at night and working
on coursework so I don’t have to go to
sleep and dream the same damn dream
every single fucking night…
Huggles
Dear Huggles
So, what actually is your problem? You
find shopping for stationary boring? I
suggest you go to Muji, all the station-
ary there is so beautiful it’s like some-
one dreamt it. I think staying up late
working is definitely not the right way
to tackle your problem; you’re better
off having as much sleep as possible
to get all these dreams out of your sys-
tem. Skip lectures; I can provide a hard
copy of this page as evidence to your
personal tutor of your problems and
reason for your absences: email me on
agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Dear Needy Mc Needy
My boyfriend and I were in bed, going
through the usual motions, when he
suggested that he might like to “shove his
cock up my arse.
” I just ignored the com-
ment and continued as we were, and he
didn’t mention it after that. What shall
I do if he says it again?
I’mnotsomekindofhussy
Dear I’mnotsomekindofhussy
Firstly, it sounds like your relationship
needs a bit of livening up if you use
words like “go through the motions.”
Did you forget to take your slippers off
again? At a risk of sounding prudish,
though, there are better ways to spice
up the love than just picking another
orifice. Try sex in the morning (unless
you sleep in the slippers, they’ll already
be off, and thus provide scope for a dif-
ferent kind of foreplay. As for what to
say, I’m pretty sure “I’m not keen on
that,” will do the trick. Then show him
what you are keen on. As long as it isn’t
a striptease involving your slippers.

Dear Needy McNeedy
One of my closest friends has started
taking a dislike to showering. Nobody
wants to mention it to him, but we’ve
all started avoiding him because he re-
ally smells! How can I tell him about it
without being offended?
KingWesley
Dear KingWesley
Your friend needs your help: there is no
good excuse for poor hygiene. The best
way to deal with this situation is to take
him aside (don’t get too close) and say
that you’re worried that he isn’t taking
his appearance seriously anymore and
that others have started to notice. Say
it like you’re the only one who thinks it
so he doesn’t think his mates have been
ganging up on him. Then run away
shouting “You smell! You smell!”
