Leather Satchel Backpack
Very twee and indie. Worn on
your back, though, not with a
shoulder strap. That would be
unambiguously wrong.
Kimya Dawson
Yeah, I first heard of her on the
Juno soundtrack, so what!
I love her escpecially in the
Antsy Pants incarnation, and I
like the name Antsy Pants al-
most as much as their songs.
She’s also lead singer of The
Moldy Peaches, and a solo
artist.
Knitting for psychopaths
I wish I could knit well enough
to craft a unicorn goring a
teddybear. See: http://gallery.

Gap
Not actually that bad. It took
a while for me to stop associ-
ating Gap with fat American
khaki-wearing tourists. What
is it with Americans and the
three-quarter length trouser-
shorts abominations that make
them look like adult-sized
toddlers?
The newest Gap collection has
some great casual light-weight
cotton hoodies, and henley
tees.

t is no secret that shopping is
an addiction; for some the high
achieved when purchasing a new
dress or slipping your feet into
new leather shoes is matched by
little else. For others, over-indulging at
Topshop becomes a regular habit, re-
ducing those that don’t get their fort-
nightly fix to a jibbering wreck. But
who says that next hit has to be from
a mass production line (hands up how
many of you have seen someone else
wearing your polka dot dress from
Primark)? West London is home to
some of the world’s top fashionistas,
and even they tend to run out of ward-
robe space by the end of each season.
The less environmentally-inclined may
trash their old Cavalli (shockingly, over
one million tonnes of clothes ends up
in landfill every year), but most hedge-
funders feel that taking their designer
rags down to the charity shop con-
stitutes giving back to society. While
your George at Asda top shrinks to the
size of a doll’s dress after a stint in the
tumble-dryer, these classic items have
been known to out-live their owners.
Nip into any of the charity shops along
Kings Road and you’ll be fighting with
the next generation fashion designers
for this season’s floral dresses and sec-
ond-hand, two-tone Kurt Geiger’s.
Vintage clothing meccas such as
Retro Woman and Retro Man in
Notting Hill Gate (32-44 Pembridge
It’s vintage darling
Road) are where you should head for
something more out of the ordinary.
Let’s face it, second-hand Chanel aint’t
haute couture, but it’s better than
Next. Whether day-glo tank tops are
your thing, or beaded brocade dresses,
these stores guarantee items that you
won’t see your lab partner sporting at
the Summer Ball. While some patience
is required to trawl through the many
rails of clothing on offer, the gems to
be discovered are worth the effort. At
the recent ethical fashion show held at
the union, items such as a vintage black
silk Ghost dress and a cream dress with
gold detailing from Aquascutum shone
on the catwalk. For boys, their shirts by
brands such as Thomas Pink and Blu-
ray are a snip at £10-£20. Match with
a new (old) cashmere vest and jeans
and you’ll be a hit in the local bar. Even
better, there’s money to be made – nip
into Retro Man or Woman with your
nicer wardrobe rejects plus proof of ID
and address and you might be offered a
few quid for them (the same applies for
books and music too!). Not only can
vintage fashion be kinder to the wallet
and reduce the burden on landfill, its
loyal followers never fail to turn a head
for all the right reasons.
Many thanks to Retro Man and
Woman for providing clothes for the
Ethical Fashion Show held at Imperial
College Union.

T
his years’ Oscar red carpet
dresses were on the whole
shockingly vanilla. In fact,
not even vanilla, fiordilat-
te. No-one dressed up as a
swan (a dress I actually loved). Perhaps
everyone was trying to desperately stay
off the radar of “worst dressed”. Isn’t
all publicity good publicity? Everyone
knows Björk’s name. Or if not the name
Björk, then crazy-swan-lady.
Tilda Swinton, oh Tilda Swinton.
Why a black velvety sheath of a dress?
She could’ve looked so lovely with her
glowing skin if she’d worn something
flattering to her figure. I mean, she al-
ready has to contend with the fact that
she’s a ginger, why make things worse
Celebrities congregate on a red carpet
for yourself. I’m kidding, I love gingers.
Well, strawberry blondes.
Heidi Klum looks like she’s about to
do panto. She has at least a few more
years till she falls to that level. Remove
the shoulder construction monstros-
ity and it would be a perfectly pretty
dress.
Johnny Depp can do no wrong in my
eyes. When he was born he hit every
branch on the beautiful tree. I love him
with Vanessa Paradis, they always turn
it on for the red carpet with their own
inimitable style.
Marion Cotillard likes mermaids.
She likes them so much she wants to
be one. At the moment she’s just dress-
ing like a mermaid; she must do this for
a year to show her commitment. The
next step is a mermaidoscopy. Then
her outside can match her inside.
Diablo Cody’s outfit is liquid awe-
someness, solidified and made into
dress form. I love the fact that she’s
metamorphisised from stripper to
screen writer and yet has no problem
wearing leapord print. She looks like
she’s having fun in her dress, rather
than trying not to breathe in a stiff,
conventional dress.
Ellen Page – dissapointed in her
dress; she may as well have turned up
in jeans. It looks like she’s styled by
Marks & Spencer. She looked better
knocked up in Juno.
