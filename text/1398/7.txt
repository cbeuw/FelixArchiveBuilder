L
ack of sleep can increase
a child’s risk of becoming
obese, according to research
scientists at the Johns Hop-
kins’ Bloomberg School of
Public Health, Baltimore. The inves-
tigation, known as a meta-analysis,
which led to this conclusion was pub-
lished in the February edition of Obes-
ity, the official journal of The Obesity
Society.
Led by Youfa Wang, the scientists
reviewed the epidemiological data of
17 published papers, 11 of which were
used for statistical analysis. A signifi-
cant association was found between
sleep deprivation and obesity in chil-
dren from the ages of 3-15. The defi-
nite reason for this is not yet fully un-
derstood, though a couple of proposals
have been made by the research group.
It could be that the lack of sleep results
in the child being more tired during
waking hours and hence less active, re-
sulting in a reduced amount of energy
being used. It could also simply be that
the child is awake for a longer period
of time and therefore has more op-
portunities to eat; thereby taking in an
increased number of calories, over the
recommended daily allowance.
There is some variation in the advice
of how much sleep a child needs. The
research group used the recommenda-
tions that children under five require
at least 11 hours per day, children be-
tween the age of five and ten require at
least ten hours per day, with children
over ten requiring nine hours or more.
They found that those not meeting
these targets (falling at least two hours
below the recommended amount)
were at an enormous 92% higher risk
of suffering from the disease compared
with those that slept for longer. Fur-
thermore, the risk of a child becoming
obese was found to fall by 9% with each
additional hour of sleep.
Wang and his colleagues have con-
sidered the possibility that the associa-
tion has a behavioural basis as opposed
to a biological one, with physical per-
formance having more of an influence
than internal biochemical processes.
This possibility is given plausibility,
given that the link was significantly
higher in boys than girls. It has been
suggested that the ways in which the
different sexes spend their late ad-
ditional waking hours could be what
is contributing to the problem, with
boys stereotypically playing computer
games and hence not being very active
whereas girls are expected to spend
more time socialising and generally be
more energetic. It must be noted that
this suggestion has only been hinted at
by Wang and does not have any strong
scientific backing as yet.
Biology, however, must not be com-
pletely ruled out. Certain hormones
have in fact been shown to play a role
in the process. Lack of sleep has been
associated with lower levels of both
leptin and ghrelin, two hormones that
influence appetite. A drop in leptin
specifically has been shown in the past
to cause an increase in hunger.
The number of children suffering
from obesity is swiftly increasing, lead-
ing to the threat of a global obesity cri-
sis. This is especially true in the United
States where there has been a 3.3% in-
crease in the number of children who
are clinically overweight, over only a
five year period. The obesity epidemic
is also a problem in the UK where 1 in
10 six year olds suffer from the ailment
and are consequently at risk of some
major health problems, such as high
blood pressure and Type II diabetes,
concurrent with the disease. Wang
made clear that a “desirable sleep be-
haviour may be an important low cost
means for preventing childhood obes-
ity and should be considered in future
intervention studies.”
The Hopkins study also noted that
it is not only sleep duration that is im-
portant but also sleep quality, with the
lead author of the paper commenting
that with regards to obesity risk it “is
another important area where future
research is needed.”
