Varsity 2008 culminated in one of the
closest matches for years as Imperial
Medicals scored a late try to force extra
time and eventually win by a mere three
points. Elsewhere Imperial won the
Varsity Day as a whole 131/2 to 81/2.
A record 1100 spectators made the trip
to Richmond Athletic Association Ground
to watch the JPR Williams Varsity Match
2008. The first half was a close affair
with penalties keeping the score board
ticking over for both sides. The first try
of the match came early in the second
half scored by the Imperial Medicals.
Imperial fought back, however, taking a 5
point lead with an unconverted try only a
few minutes of normal time left. Imperial
Medicals hit straight back with strong
drive from the kick off resulting in a try to
level the scores and force extra time at
19-19.
Extra time was very tense with only a
penalty eventually winning the match for
the Imperial Medicals leaving Imperial
to wait another year for the elusive JPR
Williams Match victory.
Congratulations to both sets of players
for providing an amazing match for the
record Varsity crowd!

Varsity Day 2008

Imperial College Union is pleased to
announce that involvement in our Clubs
and Societies continues to grow with
total memberships already past last
year’s record number. Imperial College
Union facilitates the running of 297
Clubs and Societies running activities as
diverse as Fellwandering to Knitting - the
number of Clubs and Societies we have
is growing too!
Already we have passed the 11,000
memberships mark for this academic
year, meaning an average of 52
memberships processed every day!
Last year in total we processed 10,604
for the entire year, so we are looking
like beating that number by a long way
this year. More students than ever are
participating this year as well with a rise
from 6,279 to 6,506 students joining one
or more Club or Society. That’s 54% of
all our students, meaning we have the
highest student involvement in Clubs and
Societies of any UK Higher Education
institution, as well as the highest number
of active Clubs and Societies, and
memberships! This is something we
are extremely proud of and consider to
be a core activity of the Union; Student
Activities.
Club & Society Update
A strong involvement in Clubs and
Societies offers more than just social
benefits to our students. Leadership
skills, training and personal development
complement our students’ already
world-leading Imperial College London
education adding important non-
academic facets to increase their
attractiveness to graduate employers.
This year we have also seen increased
use of our online tools for Clubs and
Society members and Officers with 60%
of all memberships purchased online
from imperialcollegeunion.org; that’s up
from 47% last year. Online spending has
also increased by over 64% (September
- February year on year), partly driven by
the suite of tools we recently launched
allowing Clubs and Societies to add their
own products quickly and easily online.
Once again none of this would be
possible without the hard work of all
our Officers who run all these Clubs
and Societies. Don’t forget you can
still join any of them by going online to
imperialcollegeunion.org and browsing
our A-Z!
