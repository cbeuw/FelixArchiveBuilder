Music Editors – Peter Sinclair and Susan Yu
The Irn Brus are on Amy!
Susan Yu
Music Editor
I
t’s me again. Well, what a quick
two weeks I’ve had. The old
cliché says time flies when you
are having fun. ‘Tis very true...
This week we’ve finally had
space to put in the Amy Macdonald
interview. It is rather naff but who
cares? My first, so you have to forgive
me. I’m new to all this, that’s my ex-
cuse. Macdonald seemed really down
to earth, unfazed by fame and all that
jazz. Glad it hasn’t gone to her head,
not like some people. Not mentioning
any names...
Anyway, I’m drifting off the point. I
went to the Union last Friday for the
Fresher Ball 2 thingy just for a laugh,
as you do. I was not impressed with the
music! It’s not on. I mean, it was alright
at the start, playing some half-decent
dance stuff with the likes of Rihanna
and Kanye West but then it just went
down hill from there. Basically, the DJ
just played a crapload of dance that no
one in their right mind would choose
to listen to. Honestly! Anyway, I’ll stop
ranting about how terrible the music is
at the Union. I’m hoping I’ve just gone
on a bad day. Let’s move on to some-
thing more relevant in the world of
music.
The Brit Awards dawned on us last
week. Best British male went to Mark
Ronson, beating strong competition
from Jamie T, Mika, Newton Faulkn-
er and Richard Hawley. Personally, I
think Mika deserved it. Let’s not get
too greedy though; best breakthrough
act is not something to be sniffed at.
On the other side of the coin you have
Kate Nash. You either hate or love her.
Either way, she picked up best British
female. I’m indifferent. Her tunes are
catchy and singalongable but I have to
say, she’s not my cup of tea.
Two gongs went to The Arctic Mon-
keys for best album and best British
group. Take That took best live act and
single and The Foo Fighters clinched
international group and best album
for Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.
Good choices, I approve.
I have to say I am sufficiently pleased
that 19 year old newcomer Adele re-
ceived the critic’s choice. I do see a
bright future for that girl. Hands up if
you saw Kylie and Kanye West coming
as best international solo artists? Kylie
will never get old, she is the princess of
pop, after all. How can you not fall for
her charms and intoxicating voice?
Taking a slight diversion... one thing
I hate about not living at home is not
being able to play my beloved piano.
As I don’t have the luxury of living in
the 5 star hotel that is Southside, I have
to console myself by going to the music
practice rooms now and then. What
a trek. Most of the time, they’re frig-
ging booked too, leaving me feeling
dejected and angry at the whole world
in general. Ah well, that’s enough from
me. Enjoy this week’s section!

Amy Macdonald is a 20 year old singer/
songwriter from Glasgow. Having first
picked up a guitar she found left lying
around the house from her father’s pop
group days at the age of 12, Amy has
consolidated her considerable success
this year with a number one debut al-
bum – ‘This is Life’ which won her the
best newcomer of 2007 award by Ra-
dio Forth. The singles, ‘Poison Prince,’
a song inferring to the Pete Doherty’s
drug addiction and his rather messed
up life, released online as a limited edi-
tion and ‘Mr Rock & Roll,’ first allowed
her to break into the Top 20. She has
also released a live cover of ‘Mr. Bright-
side’ by ‘The Killers’ recorded at the
King Tut in Glasgow.
With a number one album under
her belt whilst busy touring being her
main agenda at the moment and with
a forthcoming single release – ‘Run’ in
March, is it any wonder that Amy is
hitting the hightime? This is definitely
the Life!
What have you been up to
recently?
I’ve had a bit of a whirlwind recently.
But it’s all been quite exciting. I’ve been
doing a lot of promotion over here and
in some places in Europe as well. It’s all
going good.
How would you describe the
music that you make?
It’s always been described as being a lot
of different things. From that point of
view, I write a lot of simple pop songs
that are easy to listen to. They are about
topics that anybody can relate to.
Who are your inspirations and
influences?
I love all different types of music. The
reason that I’ve started in this is be-
cause of the band Travis – they inspired
me. And then after that I listened to
bands like Oasis, Ocean Colour Scene
and The Libertines and now bands like
The Killers. I get inspired by loads of
stuff really.
When did it hit you that you’ve
finally made it?
I don’t think I’ve ever had that feeling,
but I mean, it’s really exciting to be in
the position that I’m in. I feel really
honoured to have been given such a
great chance and people are taking my
music so well.
And with a number one album,
that is something pretty amazing
isn’t it?
Yeah, it’s great that it went to number
one, after so long since it had been re-
leased. It just felt like the momentum
was still going.
Which track from the album are
you most proud of?
I don’t think you can choose a particu-
lar track because the album as a whole
is what I’m truly proud of.
Has success gone to your head
yet?
No, not at all. I only ever got into this
business for music. I was never in it to
be famous or have my face all over the
country on the covers of Heat maga-
zine or anything. I’m still just the per-
son I that I have always been back at
home in Glasgow and I think I will be
in the very foreseeable future.
So is it all just the music for you
then, not the money, not the
flashy lifestyle?
If I can earn enough money to get by,
by doing this, then I’d be happy.
Is success something that money
can buy?
I don’t think that my success has been
bought. I know I’ve put so much hard
work and at times it has been really
hard to keep going and I have done so
and I’m really content with how things
are.
Music-wise, do you think you are
similar to anyone?
Not really. I kind of get the obligatory
comparisons to other Scottish singers/
songwriters like Katy Tunstall, Sandi
Thom. We all sing but make complete-
ly different styles of music, so I don’t
think the comparisons are really ac-
curate. But now that the album’s been
out for a while, I don’t tend to get the
comparisons so much, I’ve just been al-
lowed to be my own person.
What are you listening to at the
moment?
Well, I constantly listen to music, I’ve
recently bought the new album by Tom
Paxton and I’m listening to that.
What do you think makes good
music?
There can’t just be a generic ‘What
makes good music?’ because everyone
has different tastes and everyone likes
different things. There are so many
things that can make a good song,
whether it be a good melody, the lyrics,
the production. So I don’t think it mat-
ters as such as there are loads of ways
that music can be good.
What aspect of being famous do
you enjoy the most?
Well, I don’t see myself as famous. I
never got into the music business to
be famous. I still live a normal life. I
do normal things like going out with
friends, going to the pub etc…
If you were to go to uni, what
subject would you study and
why?
I was meant to be going to go to uni to
study social sciences, with geography
being my main subject.
Was that your favourite subject
back in school?
Yeah, my favourite teacher was my
geography teacher and that made the
classes a whole lot easier.
Were you the teacher’s pet by
any chance?
No, not at all.
What kind of student were you?
Lazy slacker, a hard worker?
With everything I do, I have al-
ways worked hard, it’s part of my
personality.
If you weren’t making music,
what kind of job would you like
to be doing?
I’d probably like to get into radio, be a
radio DJ of some sort.
Would you say you’re a ‘Party
Girl’?
No I don’t go to that sort of stuff.
Do you ever get stage fright?
No, not at all. I’ve been really lucky as
it’s not something that I suffer from.
I think it would be terrible if being in
my job and getting nerves everyday, it
would take the fun out of it if you are
nervous and worried about how things
are going to go.
Name me something that will
always get you going? Caffeine,
hot chocolate?
Probably just music. I don’t drink cof-
fee and I’m not really a hot chocolate
fan. I can’t take hot drinks.
Which cold drinks do you like
then?
Irn Bru.
If you can meet anyone alive or
dead who would it be and why?
Frank Sinatra. Because I think that he’s
such a wonderful talent. A wonderful
singer, it would be great to a do a duet
or work with Frank Sinatra.
Who are your role models?
I don’t know. If I am honest, there are
musicians that I look up to but I don’t
think I’d base my own life on them. I
think I just take anything as it comes
and make my own decisions.
Have you got any mottos in life?
What is meant for you won’t pass you
by.
Do you ever get days where you
think sod it, I can’t be bothered
with this anymore?
Everybody gets a bit of that but it’s
never to do with playing the music or
singing. Doing promotion and signing
can get quite repetitive and tedious.
When’s your new single ‘Run’ go-
ing to be released? Tell me about
this track for people who haven’t
heard of it yet.
It is going to be released on the 3rd
March. ‘Run’ is a song that I wrote
completely inspired by the band ‘The
Killers’. I love ‘The Killers’. I went to see
them perform and I wanted to write a
song that I felt ‘The Killers’ could per-
form, essentially.
When does your tour start?
Monday 4th February in Belfast.
So is it a national tour, or will you
be going abroad?
February, I’ll be touring in U.K. and
March, the rest of Europe.
What do you see yourself doing in
10 years time?
If I can be doing this in 10 years time,
I’d be ecstatic, but if not I’d probably
go back to university and do something
related to geography. I’m happy with
what I’m doing at the moment, if that
continues then its great but if not, we’ll
see what happens.
