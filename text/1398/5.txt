N
ot unexpectedly Matt
the Hat, chief critic of
Fairtrade at Imperial,
responded to my previ-
ous letter with another
compilation of well known false criti-
cisms of Fairtrade. It’s Fairtrade Fort-
night right now and I am rather busy
organizing events like our Wine Tast-
ing next Wednesday (see www.impe-
rialfairtrade.org.uk for details). That’s
why instead of a nice coherent text I
reply in bullet points.
– Let’s start with a review of where
our little discussion is right now. Matt
doesn’t like Fairtrade and thinks free
trade is a better solution. I say Fair-
trade does not interfere with free trade
whatsoever. Instead it facilitates it as a
way to fight poverty.
– Matt thinks I am right – but only
from a consumer perspective. Appar-
ently, it doesn’t work for the rest of the
value chain. Matt claims that every
coffee producer should have to sell
their coffee for a “market price” set by
traders depending on the momentary
supply and demand. Luckily, no one is
forced to sell their coffee through one
of the big coffee exchanges where this
happens. Instead we have free trade
where anyone can sell to anyone for
any price they agree on. Starbucks, to
name one example, buys most of their
coffee through long-lasting contracts,
at twice commodity price! According
to Matt this violates the rules of the
free market.
– Matt claims Fairtrade works as a
donation on top of the actual price.
Wrong about Fairtrade
You might say this. But then you would
consider buying a bottle of Bonaqua
a donation to CocaCola because the
market price of drinking water is set by
the free drinking water tap in the toilet.
Matt is grossly wrong here. What he
thinks is a donation is in fact a mani-
festation of the free market: The price
is set by what the consumer pays.
– One more bullet point on the free
market thing. Given that you refer
to an article published by the Adam
Smith Institute and explain to the Felix
readership how a free market works, I
assume you are familiar with the con-
ditions required by neo – and classical-
liberal theories: Perfect market infor-
mation and perfect access to markets
and credit. They are non-existant for
most producers in developing coun-
tries. And here’s some homework for
Matt: Have a think why that might be.
– Let’s move on to Matt’s primary
worry: He thinks that the more people
buy Fairtrade, the more non-Fairtrade
farmers lose business. But the overall
demand doesn’t decline because of
Fairtrade! Because Fairtrade is part of
the free market the demand for Fair-
trade products will governs the rate
of their production. That’s why you do
not put one non-Fairtrade farmer out
of business when you buy Fairtrade.
Instead you give one more farmer the
chance to sell his coffee to Fairtrade
conditions.
– More as a side note I would like
to point Matt to the Wikipedia entry
on the “Fair Trade Debate” which ref-
erences a study showing that within
a community of Fairtrade and non-
Fairtrade producers everyone benefits
(due to the improved infrastructure,
credit facilities, etc.).
– One criticism that Matt raises in
his last paragraph is that Fairtrade en-
courages farmers to produce a product
for which on the world market there is
no demand. What he doesn’t know is:
Thanks to the fair pay that Fairtrade
producers receive many of them have
the chance to diversify their produc-
tion away from non-competitive crops
towards higher valued ones. Without
Fairtrade they would often not have
the capital to achieve this. Matt says
that he “would generally applaud”
such a move. I suggest he goes to the
Fairtrade Foundations offices and ap-
plauds. That would certainly be better
than condemning an idea because he
does not understand it.
– Matt points out that he has a bet-
ter solution to the problem of poverty.
He proposes to open the markets world
wide. Currently, both the EU and the
US governments subsidize their own
farmers to compete with those in Afri-
ca. At the same time they force African
countries to not pay subsidies to their
farmers. I can see two ways to stop this
injustice. You can of course write a let-
ter to your MP hoping that this will
have an effect on a political strategy
which is in place to protect the British
economy from competition. Or you
walk down to your local supermarket
and buy a range of products that fa-
cilitate the free market by giving dis-
advantaged people access to the world
market. The first method is waiting for
others to act, the second one is acting.
Fairtrade opens up the free market for
people who otherwise would not be
able to participate! It helps them help
themselves.
I hope my hastily compiled selection
of bullet points is sufficient to explain
why Matt is wrong in his critique of
Fairtrade. To end with I would like to
invite Matt to a debate organized by
the Imperial Model United Nations
Society. Next Monday you will be able
to hear a talk by Charles Abugre, Head
of Policy of Christian Aid (who inci-
dentally campaign for trade justice and
Fairtrade) and join a debate discussing
whether it should be defined a human
right to receive a fair price that facili-
tates social development for your work.
The debate will follow the rules of UN
councils so lengthy contributions like
this one will be forbidden.
