FELIX 3
C R O S S - C O U N T R Y H O P E S RISE
The results of our match against Lloyd's Bank and two
other teams a fortnight ago are not to he taken at their face
value. Although Imperial College finished 4th, six of our
runners were participating in the U.L. v Cambridge match.
Our seoond team matoh against Westminster College,
last Wednesday, was lost by two points, even; <mmrf*
Chas. Cotterill won the race whilst ostensibly "getting
to know the course".
Last Saturdays race, on our home course, really gave
an indication of our potentialities. Without Evans,
Pain, Ifeller and Conway, we came within two points of
beating Reading University, who are generally reckoned, a
powerful side. It i s interesting to note that the first
thirteen men home a l l broke thirty minutes, and many
personal best times were set up. In particular, Webster
is to be congratulated or. a fine run which will easily
earn him a place in. the University seoond team.
L.S.E. were third in this match,I.C.2nd team 4th., and
Pearl Assurance Co. 5th.

SQUASH Westfield College Won 4-1
The Hockey team i s s t i l l unbeaten and the standard of

very noticeable this season.
The squash teajn played well against Westfield, the
first string, Margaret Brown, being particularly outstanding.

round of the U.L. cup with a 4-0 v i c t o r y over Univ-
e r s i t y College Hospital on Nov.5th.Thestandard of
play was atrocious and i t i s obvious that further
progress i n the Cup w i l l only be made by increased
fitness and more constructive football.Goalscorers
were Holgate(2),May(l),and McVeigh(l).
The second defeat i n the U.L. league was suff-
ered on Wednesday,Nov.2nd.,against King's , the

esting.

schools.Their record,at present, stands at:
P.8 W.2 D.2 L.4.

The f i r s t TOUCHSTONE weekend of the new
session was memorable. Several new faces were
welcomed and the fact that Satuday Was November
5th did not impair proceedings}quite the contrary
The speaker was Mr. \I.R. Ridley, the v i s i t i n g
lecturer i n l e t t e r s to Imperial College. The
subject, "Censorship" proved d i f f i c u l t and rather
elusive. Mr Ridley delivered a stimulating t a l k
in which he successfully directed the course of the
ensuing debate and opened up i n t e r e s t i n g questions
on a l l forms of censorship. The debate then opened
and covered subjects varying from Japanese f i l m s ,
through the meaning of freedom t o Horror Comics,
Later i n the evening, nature providedlJier
own GuyFawkes display with a b r i l l i a n t lightning
storm; l i g h t n i n g struck the telephone wires and
set f i r e to the switchboard. Several members of
the party succeeded i n sleeping through the arrive)
and departure of no less than three fire-engines.
The following morning saw several groups doggedly
defying the r a i n i n t h e i r tours of the countryside.
At lunch the discussion was h e a r t i l y re-opened.
The party returned to South Kensington at 5 o'clock
and without exeption a l l agreed that a very pleasu-
rable and worthwhile week-end was spent.

W i n t e r Championships
After a lapse of fifty years, the University of London
Athletic Association have re-started the Winter Relay and
Field Events Championships. The meeting will be held on Wed-
nesday, 16th November at 2.30 in Motspur Park. The College
team will be relying on their- old-stagers in some events,
although in others everything must be left to the freshers.
Our prospects in the Relay seem brightest. In the 880 x mile
x 880 we have B i l l Pain, John Evans and Les Looker John
Evans won the 1500 metres in San Sebastian: B i l l Pain was
last year's Captain of the U.L. Cross-Country Club: Les
Locke i s a promising pupil of Franz Stampfl.
In the throwing events we s t i l l have Phil Toyribee and are
hoping that his strength has not waned over the close season.
Im the dumping events the freshers will be playing a leading
part as kUke Browne will not be available for either the
Longjump or Hop, step, and, jump and Terry Hyslop i s no
longer with us for the high jump. This meeting appears to
be a very good idea as i t will keep up interest in winter
training whioh does tend to become tedious without any
competitive running.

ersity twice and Cambridge once.

e of the freshers have had pre-
vious judo experience,and so the prospects for this year are
bright.The increasing interest displayed in the "gentle art"
can be largely attributed to the skill of our instruetor,Mr.
TiP.Leggett(6th Dan)..
The first match of this season will be fought against
uambridge ifriiversity Judo Club,away,on Saturday November 19th,

F i r s t XI Results
Sat. Oct. 29th v Vickers Armstrongs - won 2-1
Wed. Nov. 2nd v Queen Mary College - won 4-3
Sat. Nov. 5th v St. Catherines
College Cambridge - drew 2-2
The f i r s t XI have improved since the begin-
ning of the season, and i f the forward line can
play more f o r c e f u l hockey, more goals should
r e s u l t .
We beat Queen Mary College i n the f i r s t round
of the University of London Cup, with only a few
minutes t o spare. The play was lethargic i n the
extreme u n t i l ten minutes from the end. At t h i s
stage we were two goals down, but three quick
goals gave us victory. In the next round we are
to meet University College, who beat Chelsea
Polytechnic 15-0.
A hard, fast and thoroughly enjoyable game
was played at Cambridge against St. Catherines
College. In spite of the fact that they play
three or four times a week, we lasted the pace
better and should have won, but f o r a goal scored
i n the l a s t minute.
