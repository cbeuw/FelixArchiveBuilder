OLD C E N T R A L I S ' SHERRY PARTY
This year , f o r the f i r s t time , the Sherry
Party given by the Old Centralians f o r those
undergraduates i n t h e i r t h i r d year was held i n
the Armourers and Braziers H a l l , Moorgate . The
Hall had the atmosphere of antiquity, f o r around
the t a l l walls i s a c o l l e c t i o n of weapons and the
s k i l l of craftsmen which would shame any museum.
At t h i s Party, were the representatives of the
Engineering professions - a l l of them Central -
ians - to help and advise future technicians of
industry. It would be unfair to mention one firm
in preference to another, f o r t h e i r "salesmen"
were a l l persuasive. Most of the studesits who
went were surprised by the co-operation which
exists between the College and the Centralians.
The meeting lasted f o r two and a half hours,
during which time a large quantity of beer and
hot-dogs was consumed, and at least one person f e l t
his qualms had been assuaged.

At the preliminary meeting of the Imperial
College Exploration Board held on Thursday, 3rd.
November, i t became clear that there i s an urgent
need f o r p u b l i c i t y to be given to the fact that
the Board i s now ready to receive details of ex-
ploration schemes.
The Board w i l l hold i t s f i r s t f u l l meeting
on Thursday 15th December, and students who have
exploration schemes f o r consideration by the Boarc
at t h i s f i r s t meeting are i n v i t e d to send details
i n w r i t i n g to Mr. E. Fairhurst, Imperial College
Office - before 1st December. The Board wishes t o
make clear that applications w i l l be received at
any time i n the future f o r consideration at l a t e r
meetings.
Applications should contain the following
minimum of information set out i n the clearest
possible manner.
(1) The proposed destination of the expedi-
t i o n .
(2) The purposes and the results expected.
(3) The number of members.
(4) An estimate of the cost.

The Moscow Dynamos team spent the evening of
November 5th walking around Kensington. It i s i n -
t e r e s t i n g to speculate what t h e i r reactions would
have been had they t r i e d t h i s en uuy Fawke's Day
some years ago.
Meanwhile the police were as busy as ever i n
Trafalgar Square - but hot with students; disturb-
ing as t h i s may seem, the mighty influence of
Senate House does not seem to have penetrated to
the teddy boys.
King's engineers recently b u i l t a bridge
from t h e i r College to t h e i r Union to show the
somewhat slow builders that i t could be done. How
about i t Guilds? - t h i s year's Engineers B a l l i n
the second f l o o r of our Union?
S e l k i r k H a l l , i n t h e i r rocket war with the
nearby women's college, used a new-type weapon
incorporating a war-head. The return broadside
which came the next morning was even more effect-
ive - a b i l l for damage.
Ted Smith informs me that 2,852.5 gallons
of draught beer were sold from the bar between
Oct.1st.1954 and Oct.1st.1955. As there are 2,066
students at I.C., the arithmetic mean i s not very
inspiring,but the d i s t r i b u t i o n would probably be
astounding.
Mines appear to have encountered considerable
d i f f i c u l t y i n "de-bogging" t h e i r t r a c t i o n engine.
The only s o l u t i o n I can offer i s putting a cat
under f.t and sending f o r the R.S.P.C.A.
The f i r s t awards l i s t e d i n the King's News
under the heading "Sports Awards" are f o r debating
and chess, K.C.L. are obviously ne up on us i n
these f i e l d s , but we hope the b o a t i n g Society
lad plenty of sport i n t h e i r fixture with Bedford
an Tuesday.
Passers-by last Th-irsday were amused to see
R.C.M. f l y i n g t h e i r f l a g f o r the v i s i t of the
Queen Mother, and a guy hanging from the flagpole*
•ver the Beit B u i l d i n g ! i l l ! !
R.C.M. sent a l e t t e r to Chem Tec. asking them
to r e f r a i n from making too much smell; i t i s time
we sent them a l e t t e r asking them not to make too
mucb noise.
Readers of the suggestions book i n the o l d
Union w i l l appreciate the contribution by Bugs
Guthrie of a d i r t y spoon selotaped to the page.
Should Mr. Mooney's answer be a clean spoon, t h i s
form of suggestion i s l i k e l y to continue, much to
the detriment of the book.
This December Q.M.C. intend to have a
Charity Rag week much on the l i n e s of those run
by certain p r o v i n c i a l u n i v e r s i t i e s . We w i l l watch
this innovation with interest as i t may eventually
grow to something involving the whole university.

The temperature rose for a couple of hpurs i n the
Ayrtort Hall on Friday Nov 4th. as the I.C. Jazz Group
held its first practice session of the term.
Terty HacVee, a member of the old group, led an cnsemblei*
of piano, guitar, double bass, oboe , trombone, and drums.
The latter, undismayed by a complete absoence of conventional
percussion instruments, performed brilliantly on a collection
of old tin lids. After a few preliminary runs the group
Settled down and produoed some passable numbers. The double-
baas played well, but the noise ratio was too much dominated
by the brass. If the group can find a pianist up to their
standards and praotice regularly we oan look forward happily
to many noisy hours at coming carnivals.
