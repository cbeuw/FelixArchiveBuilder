Major repairs had to be carried out on the
Mines Traction engine seeently, and i t was decided
to move Clemintine from the bomb s i t e i n Prince
Consort Road to the Guilds yard.
Unfortunately the monsoons had softened the
earth after the summer draught, and more earth was
moved than the engine at the f i r s t attempt. The
following day, a group of gangers, foreman,
overseers, consultants, advisers, and even onlookers
assembled to see Clemintine leaning drunkenly to
port contriving to f l a i l the earth. S i x hour!
l a t e r a rope was produced and the engine was pulled
oat quite e a s i l y wlthowt needing any of the wedgee
planks or pulleys recommended.
while resting OIL tfoe rubbish dump i n the
Guilds yard, Clementine again developed a l i s t to
port. The angle o f i n c l i n a t i o n shows the maahlme
to have been under the weather, and i t appears that
i t s weight must be reduced or the parking sites
must be strengthened i f the engine i s to maintain
an even k e e l .

The first E.C.S. Union meeting of the year was hexd
on November 1st, under the Presidency of Brnie Guthrie,
and the Vice-Presidency of Miss Paddy Clarke. The minutes
the last meeting ware quickly disposed of by the Hon. Seams*
tary.Alastair Pairbairn, and duly signed. ICLsa Clarke was
then invested with her pjk» Bonnet of office, loudly acc-
laimed by the appreciative Scientists.
On the subjeot of Borphy Day. i t was decided that a
>
party from the R.C.S. would tewel down on a party I I mlsa!
the fire engine was going down to Putney, (with or without
3pare hig-«nds), and the Union was reminded that a gentleman's
agreement between the colleges forbade interference with
each others mascots.
Ernie Gutrorie informed the Union that i t was contributing
£250 to the proposed Exploration Board. Guilds and I.C.
Unions giving £250 and £500 respectively, lines having no
assets and •therefore raaldjig no contribution. In answer to
questions, i t transpired that- this was a sprat to catch a
mackerel, in the form of large contributions from Societies
such as the Geographical, however, onoe we had the* mackerel,
it would be bad form to ask for the sprat back. Several
members of the Union expressed concern over its large
financial resources, and the hopes that the money could be
used more profitably.
The subject of the fire engine was again "brought up,
several suggestions for naming it "being put forward, mostly
relating to ancient and terrible monsters. The Union's
decision, however, was postponed. The chairman of the
Entertainments Committee asked for suggestion for the R.C.S..
Smoking Concert, whioh is- to *s held in December. Anyone
with ideas is asked to get in touch with him.
The meeting was closed with a hearty Kangella.

Hundreds watch November 5th Celebrations
This year, l i k e l a s t year, Guy yawKes" Hop was
held at Harlington. The quiet Clubhouse was decor-
ated with lanterns and streamers; two bars had been
arranged to cater for the hundreds who would soon
arrive, and soft music d r i f t e d soothingly from the
loudspeakers as a l a s t minute check of tha programme
was made. Out on the balcony a small group o f men
watched the rockets ascending from another celeb-
ration about a mile away t i l l a loud report a t
t h e i r feet made them realize that someone was watch-
ing them. In a few seconds there was a battle rag-
ing between the men on the balcony and the men i n
the Car-park - terminated v i o l e n t l y by Sxkx's Bombs
and a Rocket-Launcher, which parted the hair of one
man indiscreet enough to raise h i s head too high.

The departure from the Union was without the custo-
mary discharge of missiles as those present with
and without t i c k e t s were conserving t h e i r supply
of audible pyrotechnics f o r l a t e r i n the evening..
As the buses arrived the passengers were
greeted by those already present with a vigorous
bombardment from the balcony. Once inside, the new
a r r i v a l s hastened to j o i n the defenders. Good use
was made of the bar which had fortunately been
extended. Hot dogs were served by a scrum half
who would charge the mob at the door with a tray
loaded with sausages wrapped with bread r o l l s .

At 8.30 what appeared t o be a London
Transport bus enveloped i n flames turned out t o
be the bonfire. The guy, which had previously
been hung from the Beit Building flag-pole by
persons unknown, was soon consumed by the flames,
A vigorous f r e e - f o r - a l l firework battlefoilowed,
in which a few of the g i r l s succombecL'to s h e l l -
shock. Those seeking refuge and a vantage point
in the buses were routed out.

The O f f i c i a l Firework display followed. The
pieces ejecting missiles making a whistling sound
were p a r t i c u l a r l y appreciated, but the pieces were
rather spread out along the rugger p i t c h , and seem-
ed discontinuous. Dancing and celebrations contin=
ued u n t i l 11.30, and there was l i t t l e of the f o o l -
ish throwing of fireworks i n t o the Dance-Hall. One
gentleman, i f he can be s a i l e d that, succeeded i n

IS REAL VALUE FOR MONEY.

with the result that many of both sexes received
an i l l - t i m e d douching.
The 'buses l e f t from 10 pm onwards, but i t
was a p i t y that the e a r l i e r departures consisted
mainly of g i r l s - doing a Cinderella act - who had
to be i n early. As many of the men were unable t o
buy t i c k e t s f o r t h e i r partners, i t would have been
better to l i m i t the i n v i t a t i o n a to Colleges whose
inmates are allowed to stay out t i l l a late hour.
The Dance was excellent f o r those wishing to take
that form of exercise - i n f a c t , a l l those people
concerned; the Social Cluba, the A t h l e t i c Clubs,
the I.C. Executive and the Entertainments Committee
must be thanked f o r the excellent arrangments made.
