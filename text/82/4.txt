Sir,
Despite recent agitation i n the Union on the subject
we were badly let down at Harlington by a premature short-
age of liquid refreshment.
At a relatively early hour brown ale, bitter, orange
juice, oider and gin were unobtainable.
Please let us see an improvement in future.
Yours,
J.M.Tagg.

Dear S i r ,
While I can appreciate t o the f u l l the
organisation and e f f i c i e n c y of the FELIX Board
and s t a f f , i n producing a raid-week supplement,
T regret t o say that i n my opinion there are
better ways of spending a penny.
The supplement had neither the point-
edness of the e d i t o r i a l , nor the appeal of the
p e t i t i o n , which i t seemed t o be, judging by the
f i r s t few paragraphs. Another point i s that a l -
though i t c r i t i c i s e d , the c r i t i c i s m offered
could hardly be c a l l e d constructive.
An alternative reason f o r publication
could be (or would appear to be) that FELIX has
become an u n o f f i c i a l organ of the Senate.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
K. J . Hopkins.
Editor's note: Since when has Senate House said,
l i k e we did, "we should have Rags"?

Dear S i r ,
Two years ago I had the good fortune
to be picked up by a mass X-ray unit. Having
seen a l i t t l e of tuberculosis I would encourage
everyone to go f o r an X-ray when the unit v i s i t s
I.C, Please note that:-
1) Approximately one i n f i v e
hundred students has T.B.ia(four i n I.C.)
2) No symptoms may be apparent.
It often takes a couple of months i n hospital
to convince a T.B. patient that there i s anything
wrong with him.
3) The disease may develop
quickly, i n a few weeks, or slowly over a matter
of years. If i t i s caught i n the early stages
the treatment required i s much shorter.
4) The mass X-ray i s quick and
simple. No undressing i s usually necessary.
The whole business of the X-ray i s so
easy and so much i s at stake. Do take t h i s op-
portunity and make sure that you are uninfected.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
The prestige of both Guilds and Mines was upheld in the
best tradition when an the evening of Friday 28th. Oct. the
Mines Hon. Pornographer gallantly accented the challenge of
Dead-Eye-Dick to a rendering of Eskimo Nell.
The result of this battle of verse was that a good
time was had by both Guilds and Mines alike. The respective
supporters present unanimously agreed that the poeaXi&a best
when renderer and audience are well "conditioned , although

S i r ,
The standard of the refectory i s deteriorating
rapidly. This i s mainly due to the 111 manners
and inconslderation among the students. Although
we are eating i n uncongenial surroundings, I do
not think we should lower our standards so that
our position becomes more invidious. Only a l i t t l e
effort i s required, l i k e returning d i r t y dishes,
coming to meals correctly dressed and refraining
from reading at meals other than breakfast.
I am voicing the sentiments o f many students ,
and hope that i n the future there w i l l be a notice-
able improvement.
yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
