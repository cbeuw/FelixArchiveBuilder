able to c o l l e c t t i c k e t s . At Ludgate Gardens another
•an hoisted the Guilds' Crest high up a lamp-post,
and although r a i n was f a l l i n g , i t did not dampen
the s p i r i t of the College. King's College threw a
certain amount of t o i l e t paper, which w i l l probably
be put to good use i n Guilds'. When the floats ar-
rived, "Boomalakas" thundered from the crowd to them
and back again!
The procession stopped just past the Aldwioh
where the students on the f l o a t s were given an
hour's r e s t , meat pies, sandwiches, and coffee.
On the return route, Guilds' passed an assembled
mob of King's students. The cheers turned to boos
when the l a t t e r viewed the former, but a stunned
silence f e l l quickly as the Guildsmen doffed their.
GUILDS' PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN BO. WITH SPANNER,
Even as the sky grew darker above, and the
rain clouds gathered, the scene i n Moorgate be-
came more picturesque and colourful as the f l o a t s
for the Lord Mayor's Show arrived, and students
dressed i n gay carnival fashion took t h e i r places
on them. An unknowing passer-bye might e a s i l y have
thought that the c i t i z e n s of past ages had r i s e n
from t h e i r graves, and indeed the pages of history
were turned back f o r a few hours. King's College
and City and Guilds' College manned the f l o a t s .
The theme "Wool through the ages" was i l l u s t r a t e d
by everyday vestment, and Colin Smith looked r e a l -
i s t i c enough i n h i s Lieutenant Colonel uniform to
be saluted by a regular private of the Royal Sig-
nals.
The procession was f u l l of the colour and
pageantry which has become so much a part of the
Show. Headed by the Horseguards and the Royal
Marines, the procession made i t s way through the
City streets to the music of eleven bands, and
the cheering crowds l i n i n g the route made i t clear
from the s t a r t that the persistent r a i n was not
going to act as a damper. After the more austere
pageantry of the Guards and the Cavalry, the Lon-
doners who packed the pavement found l i g h t r e l i e f
in the gaily-decked f l o a t s manned by even more
g a i l y decorated students.
The main body of Guilds' - over 200 - t r a v e l l -
ed down by tube to B l a c k f r i a r s . On the way, an e l -
derly gentleman descended from t r a i n , c a l l e d a por-
ter, and explained that he had an "uncomfortable"
journey. The porter entered the carriage, and was
immediately ejected with a barrage of missiles of
a non-lethal nature. When the Guilds' reachedtheii
destination, an inspector tripped over, and was un
multicoloured headwear i n unison,
Reggie (King's mascot) -md placed them over t h e i r
hearts i n mock f u n e r i a l everence. This action was
followed by a steady stream of orange peel which
l i b e r a l l y covered the front ranks of the King's
men, women and children.
Towards the end of the Show the floats were
separated froni the bands, and those upon them were
asked to make t h e i r way back to the H a l l i n which
they changed. They came upon a band marching i n
s t r i c t tempo - and joined i t i n an orderly fashion
much to the amusement of the crowds. And so ended
the 1955 Lord Mayor's Show. The organisers, both
turned to face
