The Imperial Immortals American Football
Club took another positive step towards start-
ing the regular season off brightly by attending
a pre-season training camp hosted by the long
standing Cardiff Cobras University AFC.
The team touched down in Cardiff Friday
night, and after a warm reception by the Car-
diff lads, began training the following day at
11AM sharp. The morning session concen-
trated on fundamentals, which are the basis of
any strong contesting football team. This was
a great chance for the rookies to test their skills
against different players in a friendly environ-
ment, and a good opportunity for the returners
to be coached outside of their comfort zone.
Fortunately the teams escaped the rain and af-
ter short team specific playbook sessions the
teams resumed afternoon practice. Working on
the often forgotten ‘special teams’aspect of the
game was the focus of the afternoon, and for
many of the rookies this was their first experi-
ence of kickoffs and punt scenarios. With the
session over, the long day ended after plenty
of pizza and socialising with the Cobras, and
another memorable night in Cardiff.
Sunday started light, as the main event of the
George Barnes
Immortals join Cobras
for pre-season camp
On Saturday 30th
October the first ever Netball
Fun Day was hosted by ICUNC. The day start-
ed with the sun shining, a clear sky and a lot of
excitable Netball girls.
As 2 o’clock approached, numbers at the
courts began to grow, with members from not
just the netball club, but rugby and hockey, and
even a few bioengineers as well. After a quick
warm up game of touch rugby, everyone pre-
pared for the Grudge Match between the Net-
ball girls and Rugby boys.
Players were called on court but the only
shooter for the girls, Nicole, was yet to arrive.
So usual defenders, Bernice and Nakai, bravely
stepped up to the plate and put on the GA and
GS bibs. As the whistle blew for the first centre
pass, the girls fully realised just how fast the
boys could move. C and WA duo for the boys,
Jamie and Joe showed off their dodging skills,
and despite WD, Becky, and C, Emma, play-
ing excellently for the girls, the boys managed
to successfully get the ball down into their
goal third. GD Lorna defended brilliantly, but
GA Chris was very nippy, and could jump un-
expectedly high for his height, and GS Max
showed lovely movement in the goal third,
meaning that the score was level at the end of
the first quarter.
A quick switch around of positions took place
in the quarter break. Nicole was put on as GA
for the girls so that there was an actual shooter
in the goal third. WA, Lucie, successfully re-
ceived centre pass after centre pass, getting
the ball down to the shooters. Brilliant defend-
ing from GK for the boys, Caolan, meant that
shots were pretty much being tipped right out
of the net! Even though Caolan could jump ri-
diculously high, this was not enough to hold the
girls back and at the end of the first half they
were ahead. (Apparently the boys’ lack of abil-
ity to stop running after catching the ball was
not advantageous to them!)
However, things began to go downhill for the
girls after this as player of the match (and top
goal scorer for the day), Rob Dowden, dem-
onstrated that boys can actually play Netball
whilst sticking to the rules. His great play (and
a lot of luck for the boys in general) meant that
the game ended in a 7-6 victory for the boys.
Perhaps this victory will spur the boys on to
win their second most important game of the
year, the JPR Williams Varsity match!
Though the girls lost this match they didn’t
let it dampen the mood for the rest of the day,
with a tournament taking place between all
those present. There was foul play. There was
amazing play. There were complaints against
the umpires. There were a few injuries. There
was a LOT of rain. But most of all, there was
fun had by everybody. ICUNC would like to
thank everyone that came and made the day
such a success!

Rugby exec beat netball
girls at their first annual
Netball Fun Day
weekend was the full scrimmage planned for
that afternoon. The coaches tried to touch up on
the technique taught to the players on the Sat-
urday during the morning session. By the after-
noon both players and coaches were pumped
for the scrimmage. The Immortals’ defenders
were rusty but held their own against a strong
Cobras offence, a positive sign for the upcom-
ing season. Rookies Ben and Dhayan were
thrown into the deep end but played extremely
well considering their relative inexperience.
The offence started slowly making similar mis-
takes to last season, however by the second half
there were clear signs of improvement from the
entirely revamped O. First downs seemed less
hard to come by, especially with great running
from fullback Alistair.
With the weekend over, Cardiff provided a
great experience for rookies and returners alike.
Everyone satiated their football hunger, and
both teams seemed to gain a great deal from
intensive training and hard hitting. It is hoped
the greater intensity, hard work and dedication
shown by the Immortals in the preseason will
translate to regular season success.
The Immortals play their first game on No-
vember 7th, at home to the Surrey Stingers and
cheered on by the newly formed IC CheerSoc.
Just in case you’re confused, the netball goal is the one without the backboard...
