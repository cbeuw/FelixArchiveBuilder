Scorpio
You wake up dazed. ‘Where the fuck are
my clothes?’ you think - ‘And my legs?’ -
‘and my elbows?’ - Slowly the memories
return. There were no elbows or legs
to begin with. You’re a paperweight,
you’ve always been a paperweight. It’s
shit being a paperweight.

Horoscopes
Aries
You narrowly avoid falling down an
open man hole on your way to a 9a.m.
lecture. A little shaken you arrive on
time but the lecturer has replaced him-
self with a cardboard cutout. Grimly
determined to learn you stay for the full
hour.
Taurus
You’ve finally found your tutor’s office
having been searching for it since term
started. You knock, no answer. You try
the handle, no luck, so you wait. It slow-
ly dawns on you that the door is painted
on the wall. Broken: you drop to your
knees and weep.
Gemini
You catch your reflection in the side of
a passing bus. That clown’s still behind
you. Still giving you the eye off his
unicycle. You’re impressed but mostly
just afraid. As he follows you across the
road you swear a solemn oath never to
circus heckle again.
Cancer
You’re sitting in Kensington Gardens
eating lunch, enjoying one of the last
sunny days of the year. A squirrel
scampers up, how sweet. You throw
him an almond. He eats it and explodes.
You forgot squirrels are allergic to
almonds. Minus 1,000,000 karma.
Leo
A stranger offers you sweets to get in
his car, of course you accept. He drives
you to the beach and the two of you
have a wonderful time playing frisbee
and skimming stones. Over lunch you
suddenly realise he’s a grizzly bear, in-
censed you club him to death.
Virgo
You receive a flower in the mail. You’re
puzzled, what could it mean? You find
it a pot and a sunny corner. You return
from lectures to find it’s turned into a
person, who’s claiming it’s his room and
suggesting you should leave. You’re sure
he’s wrong but who are you to argue?
Libra
You wake up, open the curtains and
find you’re at the bottom of the ocean.
‘What a startling turn of events’ you
think. Owing to your new location the
walk to college takes longer than usual
and when you arrive you’re 100 years
in the future.
Sagittarius
Passing through a turnstile you slip and
become tangled in the mechanism. You
find yourself rotating constantly head
over heels. It’s nauseating but you quickly
become used to it. Soon you start meeting
people and before you know it, you find
a nice girl, settle down and start a family.
Capricorn
That satellite’s watching you again,
tapping into your thoughts. Using your
newly-acquired knowledge of Mechan-
ics you build a giant catapult and fling
yourself up at it. You pass it by and land
with a bump on the moon where you
build a castle and live like a king.
Aquarius
You didn’t read the contract for your
house before you signed it. Now the
police and your landlord are banging at
the door. He’s wearing a coat of made
of ex-tenant’s skin and kidneys and now
he wants a matching hat. There’s no way
out.
Pisces
On your way back to halls you fall down
an open man hole. You fall for hours as
a menacing, fiery glow grows beneath
you. The screams of the damned swell
orchestrally and you land impaled on
Satan’s pitchfork. He torments you for
all eternity - but at least you’re not alone.
“North Koreans get to see their
first living South Korean”
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
Oh anonymous 2nd year Maths girl, that isn’t where you put it! Didn’t your mother ever teach you how to use it
properly? Wait don’t answer that, I’ll ask her myself when she finishes cleaning herself up in the bathroom...
