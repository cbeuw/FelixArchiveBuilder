Crossword
Theme: Fireworks
Hey guys. Once again, this is no
normal crossword, as you may have
guessed by the strange red squares.
Three clue answers (all past
participles), when combined, should
conjure up three names in your
head. They all have something in
common. Using these names, the
red squares can be filled in to reveal
a representation of something that
is most commonly seen on the 5th
November.
Pay attention to the lengths of the
clues: some red squares will be
able to be filled in just by solving the
clues; others will not, so you’ll need
to understand what’s going on in
order to fully solve this weird thing.
