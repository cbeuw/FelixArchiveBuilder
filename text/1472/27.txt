The basics of cooking begins with an odd-looking stick woman and a black pan cooking on a distasteful hob
“One cannot think well, love well, sleep
well, if one has not dined well.” – Vir-
ginia Woolf.
We at the Cooking Society came to the
same conclusion. After all, these three
things are what we’re here for, right? I’d
like to add “party well” to the list, but us
Imperial students know better...
It all started three years ago in Pem-
bridge Halls, when the founding com-
mittee members were but young Fresh-
ers. Whether upon returning from a
gruelling day at university, or stumbling
home after a good night out, a hearty
meal was always in order. Fortunately,
most people in our halls were enthusias-
tic cooks. At least once a week, ten of us
or so would each cook a dish that could
easily feed four, then squeeze into one of
the tiny kitchens and eat enough to feed
a small village. Our love for food grew
and grew, as did our waistlines, but let’s
not err on that.
It soon came to our attention that
there was a need, indeed a hunger, for
a Cooking Society at Imperial College.
Our mission? To end the student’s ste-
reotypical diet of overcooked pasta and
dodgy kebabs, to help cooking virgins
learn the basics and to further the exper-
tise of accomplished cooks, and last but
not least to promote healthy eating in a
world overrun by processed gunk.
To this end, we hold fortnightly cook-
ing events, each pertaining to a spe-
cific theme which changes every ses-
sion. Events in the past have included a
Christmas dinner, a cake sale for RAG
week and an Empanadas-themed (South
American pasties) fund raiser for the
Chilean earthquake victims this year.
This year we will be holding many
more such events, with a planned shared
session with the Chocolate society mak-
ing truffles and raw chocolates and
another one of our popular Invention
sessions where members must make do
with a random selection of ingredients.
We also offer delectable social events,
including subsidized restaurant outings
and visits to local Farmer’s markets and
food fairs. We are also hoping to secure
tickets to the MasterChef Live event on
the 12-14th November, featuring ac-
claimed celebrity chefs such as Michel
Roux Jr. and the iconic TV show pre-
senters John Torode and Greg Wallace.
A fortnight ago, we held a very suc-
The best of the 1920s: Prohibition is back
Those who paid attention in GCSE His-
tory will remember what a fantastic time
1920sAmerica was: cue Rudolph Valen-
tino, the first heartthrob of Hollywood’s
silent films; thriving underground
speakeasies under the Prohibition act
and the infamous Valentine Day’s Mas-
sacre of Al Capone. Just don’t mention
the Depression that followed...
So 80 years after the booze ban
was lifted, why on earth am I talking
about Prohibition? The illegal parties
it spawned serving moonshine and the
like has inspired an increasingly popular
event, titled ‘Prohibition’, no less.
Rooting from the humble Bourne &
Hollingsworth bar in Fitzrovia which
catered to 80 people, the impressive
Bloomsbury Ballroom is quite a step up
after four incredibly successful events.
Mark Holdstock, the mastermind be-
hind the concept, makes you sip liquor
out of teacups, hides bottles among the
plants and even organizes a mock raid
- so fear not if you think your squeaky
clean criminal record is about to be
tainted. Complete with gambling tables
and flappers dancing the Charleston,
Prohibition offers an edge to the stan-
dard RnB nights saturating the clubbing
scene. The only requirement for punt-
ers is to turn up with attire reflective of
the ‘Roaring Twenties’, whether that be
flapper dresses or moustaches and pin-
stripe waistcoats.
Saturday 6th November 2010, doors
open from 8pm at the Bloomsbury Ball-
room WC1B 4DA. Tickets cost £15
from www.prohibition1920s.com and
are selling out fast!
Dancing flappers, illegal moonshine but no Wall Street Crash in sight
