tic feeling to the record and will please
fans of Jack Johnson and James Blunt.
Overall, this is an excellent first re-
lease, showing that whilst we search far
and wide for new music, amazing musi-
cal talent may be right under our noses.

A
fter the quickest devour-
ing of a Nandos chicken
you have ever seen, my
plus one and I hopped
over to watch Feeder
play at Shepherds Bush Empire, one of
London’s most iconic and surprisingly
intimate venues.
Feeder came on to a great reception
and, after forgetting the support act’s
name mid-way through thanking them
(awkward…), got to it straight away
with a loud and energetic rendition of
White Lines, taken from their latest al-
bum Renegades.
Feeder’s music has changed so much
through the past two decades that fans
of their new music are very different
from the older fans. A bit like bringing
grandparents together with uni mates at
Feeder blast classics
and bring the rock
Don’t care for synth? Tired of auto-
tune? Then Todd Kuffner’s debut album,
‘Squirrel Hunter in Training’ may well
be the album you’ve been waiting for.
Currently studying for a PhD at Impe-
rial, Kuffner is a self-confessed musical
‘dictator’, which has led to this album
being a solo project in it’s truest sense,
with every aspect being done by the man
himself.
This album is the antithesis of today’s
bland, anonymous pop music – the com-
positions are simple yet effective and the
Lo-Fi production lends a sense of inti-
macy to the record. The honest, heartfelt
lyrics combined with melodic guitar and
mandolin lines give a summery, optimis-
Oli Wilkie appreciates a humble Feeder in Shepherds Bush
a wedding, they didn’t really mix well.
At any given time, one part of the crowd
would be buzzing whilst the rest would
be patiently waiting for the songs they
knew and loved. Luckily for the latter,
the songs in the set list were far from be-
ing in chronological order so you didn’t
have to wait long.
Unsurprisingly the bands most memo-
rable songs, Buck Rogers (hes got a
brand new carrr..you know the one),
Seven Days In The Sun, Feeling a Mo-
ment, Just A Day, and Find The Colour
all brought the house down, their respec-
tive live renditions felt so invigorating
and life-affirming that even the most
reluctant of gig-goers found themselves
shifting rhythmically in their seats.
The best thing about the gig was the
humility of the band. Here is a band that
shares playlists with Kings Of Leon, Kill-
ers, and Oasis but that doesn’t give off
that holier-than-thou crap. They came,
they played, and everyone had a really
good time. Can you really ask for more?
Glasgow has been the birth-place of
many a cheeky, ‘indie’ group: from the
excellent Frightened Rabbit to mind
numbingly banal Fratellis. Mitchell
Museum, named after a library like the
intellectual clichés they are, have just
released their debut album The Peter’s
Port Memorial Service. Their sound is
not unique coming across as a jangly
lo-fi sound of 2006. Unlike many a de-
but album this one flows from track to
track tastefully. There are only a few
delicious lyrical crumbs, producing
a cheap cookie on the highly stacked
indie music bakery shelf: briefly sat-
isfying but lacking in chocolate chips.

Liars started out as a dance-punk
four piece from the same New York
scene that bred LCD Soundsystem
before they fired their rhythm section
and dramatically changed their sound.
This abrupt stylistic shift resulted in a
series of albums that contained darker
and more experimental songs, coated in
reverb and detuned guitar. Their most
recent album, Sisterworld, finds them
bridging the gap between their more
abrasive and accessible moments to
stunning effect, and their new single
Proud Evolution, released of the 19th
of october, is its powerful centrepiece,
merging a propulsive bassline with
Angus Andrew’s chanting, spooked vo-
cals. - Jamie Fraser

Mike Hadreas quietly released his de-
but album ‘Learning’ earlier this year
to much critical acclaim. He has been
likened vocally to a particularly down-
beat version of Sufjan Stevens, however
in contrast to ornate and sprawling ar-
rangements Perfume Genius mainly
relies solely on simple piano melodies
with the mere accompaniment of synth
strings. His sound musically is rather of
a similar tone to Emily Haines’ solo ef-
fort ‘Knives don’t have your back,’writ-
ten while mourning her father’s passing.
‘Learning’ is an open heart pouring
out an ethereal sorrow for an album’s
duration, and it is clear to see how
much the songs wrench on Hadreas as
he performs only meters away. Every
line is stressed as if its contents cause
great pain to reminisce, which make

a debut album
you feel captivated by his memories but
also uncomfortable at their remarkable
bluntness and intensity. ‘Mr Peterson,’
a song detailing the suicide of an older
lover - with paedophilic undertones -
could be considered an example of the
latter.
One criticism that could be asserted
here is that really there is only one emo-
tion conveyed. Unlike the Emily Haines
album, there are no songs where you re-
ally feel as if the artist is getting through
the sorrow, or are particularly uplift-
ing. It leaves you undecided, whether
there is hope for healing these scars or
whether there is still much more hurt to
reconcile.
