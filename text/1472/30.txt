My play is called ‘Taliban bath-

Dear Diary,
I’ve just graduated with a 2:2 in Biol-
ogy. Or Chemistry. It’s one of them I
think. Job prospects in London are dire
and I didn’t think I’d be getting a pay
cheque through my door any day soon.
However, I met an extravagantly at-
tired black gentleman today who called
himself ‘J. Dawg Drying’ or ‘J. Dawg
Dryin’. He seemed like the sort of guy
who would drop a ‘g’. He told me he
had a ‘cash-in-hand opportunity’ for me
if I was prepared to ‘suck a few dicks’.
He was apparently in ‘the pleasure in-
dustry’. I knew what he meant – he
was a pimp. Whilst I was initially ap-
prehensive about sucking a few dicks,
Shakin’ J. Stab-box gave me the num-
bers and I simply couldn’t turn the offer
down. Three dicks and I’d paid my rent
for a month! Four dicks and I’ve paid
my xbox live membership for a whole
year! 475 million dicks and I’ve bought
google! After saying ‘dick’ so much, I
became desensitised to the disturbing
image in my head of me sucking dicks.
There was this really funny one where
this huge gold Buddha statue wanted
me to suck his huge gold dick. I’ve just
read that on paper and it’s sort of lost the
original joke. He told me to meet a man
outside Boots on High Street Kensing-
ton. I thought that this was quite a pub-
lic location, but I guess it’s some sort
of double-bluff for the police. I shook
Shakin J’s hand, well the tiny bit of hand
left visible underneath the profusion of
gold rings, and said, ‘You just tell me
the time, the place and I’ll go suck the
dick’.

Diary of an Imperial Graduate
Dear Diary,
I had just taken my suit to the dry clean-
ers early in the morning and thought I
could get away with wearing my dress-
ing gown. The dry cleaners is just across
the road and I’m on good terms with
the owner, Janet Hogg, so I knew she
wouldn’t mind. Halfway across the road
I bumped into an young, scrawny look-
ing fellow. I told him I was trying to get
to ‘J.D. Hogg Drying’, but he thought
that I was trying to introduce myself. Be-
fore I could correct him, he was crying
his eyes out and wailing about having
no job. I discovered that he was a fellow
Imperial graduate, so I thought I might
be able to help in out. I am the CEO of
‘pleasure industries’, a mass distributor
of massage oils and I know that phar-
maceutical companies are desperate for
biology students. Or chemistry students.
Doesn’t really matter, just so long as they
know how to put things in a test tube and
describe the colour. I have a few con-
tacts that I know are looking to recruit
for a week’s paid trial, cash-in-hand. I
told him that he might want to suck up
to the interviewers. Well I said ‘suck a
few dicks’, but I assume he knew what
I meant – I mean, he IS an Imperial stu-
dent. I told him that he could be making
£200 a day and then he sort of just stood
there smiling weirdly. He started talking
about a giant gold Buddha – fuck knows
what was wrong with this guy. I gave him
the details of a pharmacist I know at the
Boots in South Kensington and then he
said something about ‘double-bluffing
the police’. I don’t think he knows what
a double-bluff is, but the text I received
from the pharmacist is rather worrying.

What did you expect to find here? A witty caption?
A joke maybe? Fuck off and get back to the article!
After receiving an angry letter from an
angry Mexican student, I feel dutifully
compelled to write a disclaimer. Kadhim
Shubber cannot be held responsible for
anything printed in this section. He has
no control over what goes on here, but he
likes to think he does. If Felix is the Re-
public of Serbia, then Hangman is Ko-
sovo. If you read on past this disclaimer
then you are accepting that you are most
likely going to be repulsed by what you
see. I cannot be held responsible for my
own opinions because I was raised by a
delightful, but racist Italian-American
couple. My parents were tragically killed
on the Mexico-USA border, so Antoine
and Camilla stepped in and adopted
me. I assimilated the Italian-American
lifestyle and learnt the names of every
type of pasta (long pasta, short pasta and
medium pasta), how to tell other pedes-
trians that you’re walking and that every
problem in the world can be blamed on
the Welsh. However, I soon realised that
my acting guardians had quite a warped
opinion of the Welsh community and
that I should blame my problems on oth-
er ethnic minority groups as well. That’s
called equality and I stand behind it! If
you don’t like what you read then feel
free to send a complaint, but don’t take it
out on the rest of the newspaper and the
respectable editors. (Oh and by the way
angry Mexican, addressing a complaint
letter with ‘Dear Sirs’ is a very sexist
presumption about the gender distribu-
tion of the Felix office. But then who am
I to complain?)
