stalks rowing
club at trials
Last weekend, after the long four hour drive
through the wind and rain from London to
Boston, Lincolnshire (a mere 22 miles from
the awesome seaside resort of Skegness), sev-
eral of the ICBC contingent wondered “What
the hell are we doing here?”; the answer – the
GB Rowing Team’s first assessment of the
year and BUCS Small Boats Head. This ex-
hausting weekend consists of a 2km ergo test
on the Saturday, followed by 5km races on
the Sunday in singles (for all GB trialists and
any students fancying their chances at taking
a BUCS medal), double sculls and pairs (for
the remaining available BUCS points). De-
spite having a depleted squad, just nine Im-
perial students came due to multiple injuries
and illnesses, ICBC put in a sterling effort
and walked away with some impressive feats
of fitness and 18 BUCS points.
With just the erg to focus on, Saturday was
a very tense day for all. The hall was very
simple – one sports hall, 20 ergs laid out in
two rows cornered off but still visible so all
could witness the fate awaiting them. All ath-
letes were measured for height, weight and
arm span before the moment when they’d
face some of the biggest names in British
rowing. ICBC can hold their heads proudly
as eight out of fifteen rowers beat their per-
sonal bests.
After a quick paddle, a big Italian meal and
some interesting sleeping arrangements the
night before, the squad awoke early on Sun-
day morning to bright sunshine... with winds
of up to 16mph. Fortunately, it was to be a
tail wind. Division by division, the results
were released and all of ICBC were happy to

Varsity
moves to
The Stoop
After several months of negotiations
and rumours, Sport Imperial were able
to confirm that the JPR Williams Cup
match will move to The Stoop, home of
rugby premiership side Harlequins.
The new three year deal will see Im-
perial’s and the Medicals’ best rugby
teams fight it out for the JPR Williams
Cup, named after the Imperial, Wales
and British Lions full-back. The game,
which is the final game as part of Var-
sity, has been played for the last seven
years, with the Imperial Medicals win-
ning every game since its inception.
Last years game, which was held at Old
Deer Park, home of London Welsh, saw
Imperial slump to a 29-13 defeat, how-
ever, despite this, Imperial went on to
win Varsity 13-11.
This year’s Varsity will be held on 16th
March 2011, with games being played
at Ethos, Wilson House and Harlington
during the day, before the evening game
in Twickenham.
Neil Mosely, Head of Sport Imperial,
commented that the event is “the most
anticipated event of the Imperial sport-
ing calendar.” When asked about the
move to The Stoop for the next three
years, Mosely went on to say: “We are
bowled over by the opportunity to use
the venue for the next three years and
are convinced that this will result in
even more interest in the event.”
The Stoop, which can hold 12,700
spectators, is undoubtedly a move in
the right direction. However, questions
have been raised over the timing of the
move, as the match has in recent years,
only managed to get roughly 1,500
spectators. Expect a large promotional
drive in the run up to the event!
