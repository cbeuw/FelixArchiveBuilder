The New Zealand Rugby Union team,
commonly known as the All Blacks
across the world, came for a quick visit
and training session in Ethos on Monday
afternoon. According to Sport Imperial,
the team did not wanting to publicise
their visit; despite this, the sports centre
was swamped with enthusiastic students
and their camera phones, as well as jour-
nalists from Sky.
An ‘exclusive’ news conference was
held in the Cafe after they had finished
their training session in the sports hall,
where the team were doing run throughs.
The side is returned to Ethos on
Thursday afternoon, where the weights
section of the gym was reserved for
them. According to one source, one of
the New Zealand coaches was heard
saying on Monday that he was going to
‘beast’ them in the gym.
New Zealand are in the UK for the
upcoming Autumn Internationals, with
their first game against England at
Twickenham on Saturday. The game
will also be shown in 3D by Sky. The
All Blacks will then play Scotland the
following week at Murrayfield, fol-
lowed by Ireland at the Aviva Stadium
in Dublin, finishing off their tour with
a game against Wales on the 27th No-
vember.
Last week, Australia broke the All
Blacks 15-match winning streak when
they beat them 26-24 in Hong Kong to
win the Bledisloe Cup. With the game
in the 82nd minute, 20-year old James
O’Conner scored a try on the touchline
for Australia and converted the goal
himself to give them the win. Several
of the New Zealand players, including
Isaia Toeava, have vowed to learn from
their mistakes last Saturday and are
hoping for an improved performance in
their upcoming game against England
on Saturday.
This is not the first time that the All
Blacks have come to Imperial, with the
side training in Ethos this time last year.
However, they were clearly able to keep
their last visit more private than the one
this week.
