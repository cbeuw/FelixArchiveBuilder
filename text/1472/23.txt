Green Week is happening from the
22nd - 26th November this year and to
celebrate, we’re launching the Green
Photo Competition. We want you to take
photos of anything being done around
College that’s environmentally friendly - it
can be research, a practical, a field trip,
something College is doing to be greener
or just someone being environmentally
aware. The categories are:
Energy
Recycling
The Natural Environment
Water
Make sure your photos are as high a
resolution as possible and include a
caption of around 30 words describing the
photo. The top 10 photos in each category
will be displayed in the College Entrance
in an exhibition unveiled at the beginning
of Green Week. To send in your photos,
email greenphoto@imperial.ac.uk

Take part in University Challenge
For the first time Imperial plans to play off
the Faculty Unions (and one Constituent
Union) against each other to provoke
competition to create the best possible
University Challenge team. The team
selected will represent Imperial in the
new series of University Challenge. After
the team led by Gilead Amit showed us
just how far a team from Imperial can
go, the competition is on to see which
Faculty has the smartest students.
Trials for each Faculty team will be held:
RCSU
8 November 17:30-19:00
SAF LT G.34
ICSMSU
9 November 19:30-23:00
Reynolds Bar
RSMU
11 November 18:00-23:00 in
RSM G.41
CGCU
15 November 12:00-14:00 in
Chem Eng LT1
The teams they select will battle it out in
a nerve-wracking final on 22 November
in SAF LT G34 where the four best
contestants will be selected to compete
for Imperial on the TV series. Gilead Amit
will be asking the questions and it’s sure
to be fantastic event. If you’d like to take
part go along to your Faculty selection
event and see if you’re smarter than the
rest!
On November 1, Union Council met to
debate the new Higher Education Funding
Policy, which supported the overall
direction of the Browne Review whilst
pointing out its flaws.
The policy also mandates the Union to
lobby for a better bursary system and
for College to increase its Widening
Participation scheme. After a 2 hour
debate, Council passed the policy.
You can read the full policy alongside
all the other outcomes and decisions
