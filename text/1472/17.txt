F
or those of you who did
not read Alexander Kha-
nin’s comment piece from
the 22/10/10 issue of Felix,
his thesis can be reduced to
a number of playground-worthy state-
ments. I have a big problem with his
reasoning and the nature of his claims
so let us work our way through them. It
will not take long I promise, but for the
sake of intelligent debate everywhere he
needs to be cut down to size.
First, that Professor Dawkins is a cal-
lous profiteer. The author, maybe trying
to be “down with the youth”, compared
him to Christina Aguilera and implied
that he is pocketing all the proceeds
from merchandise sales on his web-
site. If you dislike someone as much as
Mr Khanin appears to, you should find
evidence to support your claims. Mer-
chandise sales from richarddawkins.net
directly benefit his foundation for rea-
son and science. To see for yourself (yes
that is evidence) go to http://store.rich-
arddawkins.net/. Dawkins, rather than
being a profiteer, is savvy in providing
monetary support (a drop in the ocean
compared to organised religions’ riches)
Elliott Hind
for his foundation at a time when reli-
gious superstition goes largely unchal-
lenged in spite of the misery it causes.
Moving swiftly on to the second
claim, anybody who has ever heard of
Dawkins is, I am sure, perfectly aware
of his opinions. He would not be a very
effective proponent of a secular society
if he didn’t state his case as frequently
and eloquently as he does. Does the
Pope stop talking about his church’s
stance on contraception and condom
use in Africa? No. Do extremist Mus-
lim preachers keep their views about the
west and women’s rights private? No.
Bizarrely, Khanin’s irrational dislike of
Dawkins appears to compel him to write
more than the despicable worldviews of
some leaders of major faiths.
Richard Dawkins is a national treas-
ure. He is passionate about encourag-
ing children to question their elders
and think for themselves. He actively
encourages a full scale assault on solv-
ing nature’s mysteries and it is clear that
he cares deeply about humanity and our
future. We could all be a bit more like
Dawkins. Yes, that includes you Mr
Khanin.
“Dawkins, rather than
being a profiteer, is

monetary support for
his foundation”
The Dawkins delusion Dear Felix,
The article titled “PG mingle delights
Union” read “GSA have done much
better job of organizing events such
as pub quizzes than in the previous
years”. This statement is slightly
incorrect. The Pub Quiz organized
once per month remains similar in
format to the one organized in pre-
vious years. However, I appreciate
Felix for noticing that the GSA im-
proved its provision of events since
July 2010 after an Events Team ded-
icated towards this goal was formed
in April of the same year.
To fill in a little history, before the
GSA Events Team started planning
events, it took the pulse of the PG
population at Imperial, by conduct-
ing an online survey. The survey,
taken by around 200 Postgrads was
an eye-opener, in which 65% of re-
spondents said that they wanted
more events and were generally un-
happy with the social scene at Impe-
rial. Subsequent personal meeting
with 15 PG’s further strengthened
our belief that the GSA should pro-
vide Postgrads a time and place
to mingle with those outside their
departments.
Since the team took-over, there
were a string of three successful so-
cial events. The first event was the
Movie Night, which turned out to be
a smashing hit with around 90 at-
tendees who paid £2 to watch “The
Hurt Locker”. The second event,
GSA Pub-Night, was another big
success and saw the participation
of around 45 students. The third
event, a Knitting and Salsa mixer,
was organized in association with
Postgraduate Society Goldsmiths
University of London and Imperial
College’s Knit Society.
The 2009/10 Events Team strived
hard to improve the social scene
for the PGs and thus have set the
groundwork for this year’s students
to enjoy a vibrant community. If the
Postgrad Mingle, with about 1000
attendees, was anything to go by,
then all signs point to a fun year.
With regards,
Shivendra
Events Director – 2009/10,
GSA
