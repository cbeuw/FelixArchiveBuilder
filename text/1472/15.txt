COMMENT
We’re all f***ed. So what?
L
ast week’s Black Sheep
certainly got the column
started with a bang. At least
I thought it had, for the first
hundred words. Then I re-
alised the noise was coming from me
smashing my head through the paper
onto the desk underneath it.
The column, headed with the whorish
grandmother of all rhetorical questions,
‘Is infidelity such a crime?’, was ini-
tially on pretty sane territory. Does John
Terry’s personal life have any bearing
on his skills as a footballer? No. He just
happens to be shit at both. Does Jen-
nifer Aniston’s love life have any im-
pact on my day to day living? Not since
I stopped stalking her in the late nine-
ties. But then the article hits engineer-
ing works at Sanity Junction and diverts
itself straight on to Crazy Towne. The
problem is this - infidelity is a weakness
of character.
That some members of Imperial are
direly in need of a Filofax to organise
their romantic engagements doesn’t
mean that it’s an understandable human
condition. We’re such a fickle bunch of
wangs in this day and age. If we can’t
Angry Geek
repress knowledge of our own faults
then the next best thing is to make it ac-
ceptable. Smoking. Drink. Donations to
‘Save The Dolphin’ charities. Why is it
that when we do stupid things our in-
stinct is to pretend it’s normal?
It wouldn’t be so bad if the Black
Sheep had maintained the moral high
ground for the duration, but by the end
they’re pouring scorn on Wayne Roon-
ey for ‘repeatedly’ lying to someone.
What? Really? John Terry slept with his
friend’s ex-girlfriend behind his wife’s
back. We’re not in the business of draw-
ing straight lines on a graph here, you
only need one data point - the guy’s a
tosser.
Humans are flawed. I’m currently eat-
ing pear drops in quantities that will give
me glaucoma by the time I’m thirty. Is
that acceptable? No it’s fucking not. Are
they uniformly delicious and am I stuff-
ing three into my mouth as I write this?
You damn well bet I am. Will my girl-
friend try to hide them when she reads
this article? Yes indeed. Will it be too
late by that point? Most likely.
Orgasm-inducing boiled sweets aside,
let’s reiterate that ‘humans-are-flawed’
point. If you’re disloyal, cheat, pay
women to do things to you that no sane
person would do in a full biohazard suit,
then you are less of a human being. If
you resist the temptation to stuff any
and all rhubarb and custards you see into
your mouth, then you are more of a hu-
man being than I.
No-one should lose their job over it,
that’s plain to see, but should they lose
the respect of their friends, family and
society as a whole? Yes they should. But
even if this doesn’t happen, even if you
can’t be bothered to summon up any
contempt for them, what you absolutely
must not do is try to justify it. “Well, we
all do it, don’t we?” is the anthem of the
slowly decaying chain-smoker, the casu-
al racist, and the serial adulterer.
So just slap yourself in the face now,
reader. Go on. Because you’re a horrible
person and you probably deserve it.
Have you been reading other col-
umnists behind my back? Tell me
they meant nothing to you at
anangrygeek@googlemail.com.
You two-timing shit.
T
hey say that when a man
is bored of London, he is
bored of life. If this is true,
I should take a running leap
off Hammersmith Bridge in
my solid concrete Hushpuppies – how-
ever, no matter how boring life may
get, I’m certain that the alternative is
even more so. To clarify, of course I’m
not bored of London, merely bored in
London.
All the usual pleas to rouse fall on deaf
ears. It’s a lovely day outside – no, it’s
typical British autumn, grey and wet.
London is filled with museums and gal-
leries – yes, and my soul is obese from
a glut of culture. It’s going on a crash-
diet of The Jeremy Kyle Show starting
tomorrow. You could always do some
work – no, I’m looking for something to
avoid boredom.
I’m sure this sounds familiar to many
of you. For all the great wonders and
sights of the capital, for all the complex
galaxies of social interaction available,
it can be painfully easy to sail into the
doldrums of interminable boredom. It’s
not like I haven’t tried; I’ve already ex-
hausted several avenues of novelty but
nothing quite scratched the itch of my
ennui.
At first I tried cleaning, that peren-
nial favourite. Everything went back in
Rhys Davies
its proper place and the newly-vacated
surfaces were polished to a shine. I
went round and round my house with
the vacuum cleaner, on all the floors.
Once, then twice and then I hoovered
the walls, just to make sure. The bath-
room was next, the toilet bleached,
the bath de-limescaled and the tiles
scrubbed of mildew. I even removed the
U-bend from under the sink and began
harrying it with a toothbrush. Althought
perhaps I should have let the bleach
pass through first. All I know is, after
seeing some phantasmagorical colours
in a faraway land, I awoke to the exact
same apathy.
I then grew more adventurous. With
some stale cheese, I was able to tempt
a few opportunistic mice into my com-
pany. Initially, they were too skittish to
learn any tricks. I thought I’d help them
loosen up by dosing them with mari-
juana (That I just happened to stumble
upon: honestly, I thought it was pot-
pourri!). Unfortunately, the only stunts
that they could perform were giggling
uncontrollably and asking if I had any
Mars bars. While this was somewhat
amusing for a little while, I stopped
laughing long before the mice did.
Adventurousness gave way to crimi-
nal insanity. Climbing to the top of the
tallest buildings I could find, I took it
upon myself to throw a series of cakes,
tarts and desserts into the metropolis
below. The result was like watching
a firework display of flour, sugar and
cream, with the same inherent joy. My
soul leapt to see a zesty lemon cheese-
cake explode across the pavement and
I felt a lightness in my spirit as pedes-
trians fled screaming from the sudden
downpour of Black Forest gateaux.
The catastrophic, instantaneous beauty
seemed to resonate with my sense of
the fleeting futility of human endeav-
our... also, it was damned good fun to
watch the custards go splat!
As my spirits began to lift, I realised
the macrocosm of my experience. Hu-
manity gets bored very easily and seeks
constantly to alleviate it through the
pursuit of the novel. We are all trying to
ease that eternal itch of the soul. Each
may have his preferred avenue; it just
takes some experimenting to find the
perfect salve.
My own experiences on this dreary
afternoon have led me to coin a stu-
pendous new proverb, or tweak an old
one (Apologies, Dr. Johnson): “When
a man is bored with inhaling bleach,
dealing illicit drugs to rodents and de-
lighting in the combination of cake and
gravity, he is well and truly bored with
life.”
Chairman of the bored
“I thought I’d help
the mice loosen up
by dosing them with
marijuana... (that
I just happened to
stumble upon)”
“Does John Terry’s
personal life have
any bearing on his
skills as a footballer?
No. He just happens
to be shit at both”
Online reactions to
last week’s
Black Sheep
felixonline.co.uk
“Well said. It’s ridiculous that
people should lose their jobs
over infidelity. Not being able to
keep it in your pants is hardly
a sign that you’re incapable
of dribbling a ball, or trend-
ing the corridors of power or
anything else for that matter. It
just shows you’re unhappy with
your relationship and it either
needs ending or at least a bit
of work.”
Nia John
“Infidelity. A hugely dramatised
word. Some people say “when
it happens to me I will...” And
some would say “ If you feel
your relationship getting stale,
either work on it, or end it.” But
don’t forget life isn’t a simple
equation. There is not a sin-
gle rule to decide what’s right.
Infidelity is so dramatised on
TV and books nowadays, that
people in it can’t think straight
anymore. Onlookers may judge,
they may give advice. But deep
down only the two person
who’s involved in it know what’s
best for them. What matters is
whether you have come out of
the tunnel a better person.”

Next week... performance
enhancing drugs should be
allowed in sport.
Letter to the Editor
Dear Editor,
During my time at Imperial I’ve
noticed that every few weeks
there is an event where conflict
between science and religion is
discussed.
I notice that the proportion
of people who express doubt
in God is much higher in coun-
tries where most people have
been educated. The propor-
tion rises further with the ‘top’
scientists. Since the scientific
revolution, religious belief fall-
en every century.
It’s clear to me that faith
groups have much to fear from
the march of progress, science
and education.

Jakov Marelic
