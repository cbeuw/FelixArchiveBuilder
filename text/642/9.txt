Di dum di diddle di dum di dum di dum di dum
di die...And now for something completely
different. On Tuesday Michael Palin will be
interviewing Dave Owen (the STOIC
Chairman, not the SDP founder member—
what do you expect, celebrities?). And now for
something completely indifferent: On
Thursday we're Breaking the News as usual.
We are also looking for a new name for the
teletext service, STOICFAX; so far Listing of
All Weekly Reports, Education News and
Coming Events (LAWRENCE) and Pro-
grammed Electronic News and Information
Service (the chairman had second thoughts
about this one) have both been rejected. In the
meantime (and the Summer Time as well),
keep watching—it may happen.
IC CND
Welcome back to College, and I hope you had
a peaceful Easter. The Easter demonstrations
were of course a big success. There will not be
much happening with us for the first two
weeks of term because I've got exams, but
here are some future dates to remember:
Tuesday May 10 a speaker from Civil
Engineers for Nuclear Disarmament;
Thursday lunchtime May 19 IC CND AGM
(keep this date free); sometime soon a speaker
from Tories Against Cruise and Trident. The
results of the Peace Canvass will be coming
out soon.

Another term, another planet.
With the islands behind me now there is only
the empty future to pull me through the debris
of the days. I'm waiting for seri, but I have mat
feeling, the one when you spill boiling water
over your left foot, that she isn't going to show
her face anymore. I'll wait around the tube
anyway. You new know. Someone came
round yesterday, but I was out. Said he was
from Rent-o-kill, but I noticed he was carrying
a gun like The Professionals. A girl was run
over later that day, and somehow I feel the net
pulling closer around me. John said that Shock
Treatment is on next Tuesday, the Rocky
Horror follow-up. I believed him.

RCS
Election papers for Ents Chairman, Publicity
Officer, Assistant Hon Sec, Bookshop Rep,
RCSA Reps, Exploration Board Rep and
Theta Bearers(l) are up at the moment.
Anyone interested in standing for any of these
posts should see either the retiring officer or
myself as soon as possible. The elections will
be held at the AGM on May 10 which is
followed by Exec initiation and a quick trip to
the Round Pond.
Other events include the Brighton Run on
Sunday and in a week's time the incomparable
Silwood Ball. The last event of the year will be
the annual RCSU v RCSA Cricket Match at
Harlington—more details next week. See you
around.
