Examinations,
Anxiety
And Commonsense
by Don Adlington:
Student Counsellor
Written, formal examinations
have a hallowed place in aca-
demic life, and while, from time
to time, educationalists have
espoused alternative methods,
they are widely accepted as the
fairest and most efficient means
of assessing students' knowledge
and understanding.
The written examination is
not however by any means a
precise instrument. It is certainly
possible, for example, on indivi-
dual papers, to come up with a
'fluke' result, that is a result
markedly better than the stu-
dent's actual ability would have
led one to expect. It is also
unquestionably possible to come
up with results that are worse
than either the student or his
teachers anticipated, and which
do not fairly reflect the student's
ability.
The risk of systematically
underperforming in a set of
examinations is linked to two
separate, but closely related,
factors: (a) an inadequate
technique for playing the exam-
ination game, and (b) an inade-
quate recognition that a formal
examination, like any other
testing situation, can generate
levels of anxiety which in
themselves may have an adverse
effect on intellectual functioning.
Playing the examination game
Examinations are to some extent
an abstraction from reality, an
artificial construct. They are a
sort of game in which the
participants are invited to
demonstrate what they know, in
writing, on a blank piece of
paper, in a set time. An impor-
tant component of the game is
that the examiners is forbidden
to give credit on any other
evidence than that presented in
the script. It is astonishing
fact that despite this elementary
point, some students insist on
abandoning common sense to
the extent, apparently of playing

another game altogether. A
common manifestation of this is
the student who spends an hour
and three quarters (out of three
hours) writing, re-writing,
polishing and perfecting one
answer out of four or five
required.
Another common departure
from the rules consists in writing
out the answers without properly
reading the questions. There are
two, equally devastating variants
to this: (a) not selecting the
questions which optimise the
candidate's chances of scoring
high over-all, and (b) misreading
individual questions and sub-
sequently writing an answer to a
question which in effect is not
there.
the end for finishing off. Some
people find that it helps to make
quick notes on each question at
this stage.
3. Be disciplined in adhering
to the timetable. Recognise that
the first few marks accruing to a
question can be obtained far
more easily than the last few—
and it is the total mark which
counts. If you get stuck in the
middle of a question leave it and
deal with the next one. You can
always return to the unfinished
answer later, and indeed the
very act of disengaging from the
difficulty may allow a resoltuion
to surface while your mind is
actually focussed on something
else.
4. Answer the easiest question
first, so that you can proceed to
the others on a psychological
'high'.
5. Don't be afraid to make
rough notes in your answer
book. When you are answering
one question, ideas relating to
other questions you are going to
answer may come into your
head—jot them down. Similarly
on entering the examination
room, and possibly before
reading the paper at all, you may
wish to write down very quickly
salient points which you have
memorised in your final prepar-
ation.
It is, of course, essential to
rule out rough work very clearly,
so that the examiners knows that
Some basic and well recog-
nised components of a good
examination technique are as
follows:
1. Read the question paper
carefully, preferably twice. Errors
of perception are highly corre-
lated with heightened anxiety.
2. Select the questions you are
going to answer, put them in
order, and write out a simple
timetable, allowing the same
time to all questions (assuming
the same maximum marks for
each). Allow fifteen minutes for
the planning and five minutes at

it does not form part of your
answer.
6. If you run out of time, tell
the examiner so, and say which
points you would have gone on
to discuss if you had more time.
Dealing with anxiety
A degree of anxiety, accom-
panied by recognised physio-
logical symptoms, is a normal
reaction to testing and stressful
situations. Everyone is affected
to some extent and should be
aware of it. You tell yourself that
you are anxious, that it is
natural, and that you can handle
it. In doing that, you minimise
the risk that the anxiety may
escalate to a point where it
becomes disabling. Again there
seem to be some common sense
ways of handling this problem.
Arrive early—far better be
biting your nails outside the
examination room, than sitting
in a traffic jam at Earl's Court.
Once you are in the examination
room, sit down and relax a
minute or two before doing
anything.
To a certain extent anxiety is
contagious. If you feel that this
is a hazard for you, then 'keep
yourself to yourself before
admission to the examination
room. It may also be worthwhile
resisting the impulse to compare
notes with all your friends
immediately after an exam.
It is also a good idea in the
examination itself, not to let
yourself be thrown if your
neighbours appear to be writing
with more facility than you are.
They may, for all you know, be
writing rubbish, and in any case,
inordinately long answers do not
necessarily bring the best results.
The most common symptoms
of anxiety getting out of hand, is
an overwhelming sense of panic,
a temporary breakdown of
our rational and ordered res-
ponse to a demanding situation.
In an examination this may, for
example, take the form of
'blanking out' — completely
forgetting everything. The
remedy for this is to switch off,
close your eyes, and do nothing
for a while.
This is far better than yielding
too easily to the powerful
impulse to resolve the tension by
giving up altogether. When you
feel that the anxiety attack has
abated, try getting your mind
working again by using a
'scribble technique'. Just write
down words —any words —
which lead to other words, until
you feel that your faculty of
recall is available to you again.
A final point. If you have a
history of becoming particularly
anxious at exam times, or if for
contingent reasons you think
that you may do so this time, it
would be sensible to talk to
someone about it well before-
hand. Tell you personal tutor or
your senior tutor, talk to a
doctor or nurse at the Health
Centre, or come to see me. Just a
small amount of practical help
may make a substantial differ-
ence in the event.
