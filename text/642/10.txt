Folkestone Easter Hockey
Festival 1983
General Report
Folkestone, Easter 1983 was
unfortunately
cancelled, leaving
knackered players lying
in bars at all hours of the
night and day
grunting (especially Charles).
While others manage
a number of games
somehow we only got
to play one which
ended 1-1.
Organisation (and Charlies
Charm)
failed miserably.
Trying to keep Chris awake was
indeed a problem.
Maybe he had some sense—
extremely unlikely.

Redman CC 25 mile team trial
on the Portsmouth road near
Guildford 27-3-83.
Appalling weather greated the
Club's first reace on fast rolling
course this year. Hotchkiss was
off at 8:00am, Williams at 8:08
and M c D o n a l d 8-22, they
looked soaked through before
they even crossed the start.
Hotchkiss was the first
indication that things were going
well, as he finished having
overtaken six riders starting at
minute intervals before him.
This gave him eventual eight
place from a field of 120.
Next back, more than a
minute before expect was Willi-
ams, who rode a stormer to take
overall sixth position and fastest
novice despite going off course.
Finally McDonald arrived,
forty seconds after his minute
man, after battling all ihe way
round to catch him and nearly
succeeding halfway.
This gave the Imperial team
fastest composite time and the
second trophy of the day.
ICl vs Guysl 2</2-2,A

Now you can see why they
were previously unreported! The
Ladies finished 7th in Div 2.
At the end of last term the
Annual Dinner at the Cumber-
land Hotel was well attended,
highly entertaining and proved
excellent value with help from
ICX. Two awards were made:
the first to Laecque Danesh-
mend as 1st team No 1, and the
second, the Neil Crozier Mem-
orial Trophy, to Ian Crindall as
the most successful team player.
The week-long tour to Pader-
born during the Vac was a great
success thanks to the large
amount of competitive squash
played, Marianne Hascher, the
British Army, mixed saunas and
German hospitality. Our hosts
were rewarded by having a
considerable number of their
rather attractive beer glasses
swiped, and by the offer of a
return tour to our slight1
v more
meagre facilities. On a slightly
sadder note I'm sorry to have to
report thai ihe tour finances will
no' stretch far enough to cover
the damage inflicted on the new
ICU minibus by Laecque during
his test.
Having dismally failed to flog
copious quantities of quality
Squash Club T-shirts to the
already overdressed Germans, I
am now in a position to deflate
the price again and offer them to
the open market at cost plus my
percentage. The artwork is
displayed on the noticebaord, as
are ordering details.
Coming up in a few Fridays'
time on May 13 is a trip to see
the Harlem Globe Trotters at
Wembley. Tickets are £4.70 and
there are (were) fourteen going.

The Boat Club gave their best
performance of the year so far in
the Head of the River Race on
March 26. The race was held on
the river Thames from Mortlake
to Putney over 4'/2 miles. It is
the largest event in Western
Europe and all the top club,
college and university crews
enter together with national
squad-based crews and several
foreign clubs.
The 1st VIII came tenth
overall out of 420 entries, taking
18min 10s. This is the best
performance of an IC crew for
twenty-five years. Of the crews
which beat them, five were
British national squad crews and
one the Italian national eight.
The only other university crew in
the top ten was from ULBC.Isis,
the Oxford second boat, came
12th, 10s behind IC.
The second and third eights
came 58th and 61st respectively,
both beating the fastest other
college crew. The novice eight
came a creditable 234th.
Following the extra long
Easter break of four days,
generously given by coach Bill
Mason, the senior squad re-
turned to racing at the smaller
scale Bedford Head. Over the
shorter 2,000m course, Imperial
College took three out of the
first four places in the fours
event, winning senior A and
senior B fours. They also picked
up the trophies for senior A
coxless pairs and novice sculls.
This was the final head race of
the winter and so the squad had
to return to intense training to
prepare for the side by side
racing of regattas. The first of
these was held at Hammersmith
over one mile last Saturday. The
college boat club dominated the
regatta winning four of the
premier events. Highlight of the
day was the senior A eights final
between ICBC, Thames Trade-
men R C and Quintin B C .
Despite a fast start by TTRC,
the 1st VIII soon hit their
rhythm and pulled away to win
by two lengths. The Senior A
coxless four won with ease as did
the Senior B coxed four and the
elite coxless pair. The next
regatta for the senior squad is at
Ghent in Belgium on May 6/7
where the opposition will be a
great deal faster.
