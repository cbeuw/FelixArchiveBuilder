Yawn!
Dear Martin
As someone, who occasionally
goes to the Union Bar for
alcoholic beverages, has on these
occasions had the need to use the
Gentlemen's Room adjacent to
the Bar I was, on Friday April
1983, amazed to notice that not
only had the basin got hot and
cold running water but also
there was soap. Even the hand-
dryer was functional. All that
was required was a nail brush,
although had there been one it
would probably have been
pinched. In my eighteen months
at College this is the first time I
have witnessed such an event.

It Wasn't Me
Dear Sir
I imagine that even the most
ardent champions of FELIX
would hardly claim that its
reports are renowned for their
accuracy and veracity. The
article you published under the
heading 'Warding off Lauwerys'
in the issue of March 23 must
surely, however, represent a new
landmark in creative journalism.
It was apparently a report of the
Student Residence Committee
meeting held on March 21 and
included the following state-
ments:
—If Mr J Lauwerys goes ahead
with the plans he proposed at a
student/staff committee on
Monday...
—The meeting...had a double
purpose: for the Union to
question Mr Lauwerys on his
report on residence manage-
ment...
and finally, best of all,
—Mr Lauwerys seemed unable
to bring forward very good
arguments in favour of the
proposal except...
This latter inability may have
had some bearing on the fact
that I wasn't at the meeting at
any point during the day, nor
had it ever been intended that I
should be present!
I remain a devoted reader.
Yours sincerely
John Lauwerys
Tea Mines
Sir
The Mines Coffee Room
Attendant would like it to be
known that A K Waner, all
streaming hords of parasitic
students, ICU hacks, physicists,
disgruntled Life Science students
and staff, and all other social
misfits, plus Mrs Shirley Veary
and Professor Wood, will all be
made most welcome at our first
floor haven of succulent trea-
sures; the Mines drinks machine
operates twelve hours a day
everyday. Run by the RSMU it
aims to subsidise nobody
merely to rip everyone off with
the least amount of effort.
Consequently it is growing
mould in the spill tray, fre-
quently jams, and slops dregs on
your feet when you bang it (or
the side panel falls off). People
rarely meet there informally
because the noise of the asteroid
machines is too great.
Visiting academic types soon
learn that the non-'scientists'
amongst us have more deeply
profound issues at hand than the
naive enjoyment of cosmetic
finery. Yet they come back for
more, such is the uniqueness of
the Mines Coffee Room atmos-
phere. So why not join them
(and us); come and share a
chocolate with a Miner today
and put life back into its true
perspective.

Speak Out
Dear Martin
We feel deprived and dis-
appointed. On the last FELIX
before the holidays we felt you
could have made a special effort
to include all the Small Ads
possible as they are often the
most interesting part of the
paper. Instead of which we have
a typically overlong Simon
Rodan article, with everything
said twice, and an appeal for the
Accommodation News
Karen Stott. Welfare Advisor, reviews the accommodation available
both for this year and for next year.
any weekday between 9:30am
and 6:00pm at 15 Princes
Gardens.
Accommodation for Next Year?
Over the last few weeks Student
Services have received a number
of enquiries from students about
private rented accommodation
for October. At present it is still
too early to make many positive
steps towards looking for
accommodation as most land-
lords are not prepared to
commit their property this far in
advance. Student Services do
have a few addresses of flats for
next year mainly for sharers but
unfortunately we won't know
about the bulk of available
accommodation until Septem-
ber. The new updated accommo*
datoin guide should be available
from Student Services shortly
and this will give you some
general hints about accommo-
dation in the private sector. In
the meantime it may be worth at
least thinking about what sort of
accommodation you may be
interested in, and perhaps
getting a group of friends
together, as accommodation
for sharers is often easier to Find
than flats for one or two people
You could also try asking
around any final year students
you know who may be living in
rented accomodation as some
landlords are happy to offer
accommodation to one group of
students on the recommendation
of the present tenants if you have
any specific difficulties, then call
into Student Services and we
may be able to help.
Your ticket to exam success?
Once again the exam season is
upon us and students every-
where begin to burn the mid-
night oil, poring over long
forgotten textbooks. It is
particularly important this term
that your life is as uncom-
plicated as possible. If you're
still struggling with your land-
lady, you may be interested to
know that Imperial College has
a limited number of single and
shared rooms in student Halls
and Houses. All the rooms are
within easy walking distance of
the College at rents of between
£20 and £25 for single rooms and
£12 to £22.50 for shared rooms.
Due to unforseen circum-
stances, we also find ourselves
able to offer a flat for four
people for the summer term in
Lexham Gardens. This is one of
the nicest flats controlled by the
College and is a bargain at only
£21 per person.
All this highly desirable
accommodation is bound to
disappear fast so to avoid
disappointment call into the
Student Services Office now or
money Simon Rodan has just
told us we haven't got.
Having only this term started
submitting' Small Ads, although
this year and last they were
generally the best part, we felt
extremely unhappy.
The Small Ads are the stu-
dent's voice. Cryptic yes, funny
yes, even if you know no one
mentioned, they provide light
relief to a boring Friday lecture.
As a result of your slashes we
were reduced to actually making
notes.
Yours disgustedly

and twelve other Physics stu-
dents
