Southside Security
In an Editorial early last term
various issues concerning secur-
ity in Southside were raised. It
was pointed out that locking the
main doors at 7:00pm achieves
little, yet annoys the residents,
and may even make access easier
for intruders, since many stu-
dents, mindful of the incon-
venience caused, Jam the doors
open or allow strangers into the
building.
The correct way in, of course,
is to use the internal telephone
system and call your host to the
door, but anyone who tries this,
having sought out the night
porters tucked away inside the
so-called 'main entrance' and
attracted their attention through
the locked glass door, will only
be allowed to use the phone
grudgingly, if at all, and made to
feel most unwelcome for dis-
rupting a relaxing evening in
front of the television.
Shortly after the Editorial
appeared Jon Barnett, the Union
Welfare Officer, and Stephen
Goulder, the President, pre-
sented College with a paper on
security to be discussed at House
Committee. This paper con-
tained several sensible and
workable ideas to improve the
situation, yet despite this (cynics
might say because of this) it has
received negligible response
from College.
Since Jon & Steve's proposals
are not particularly well known
by the student body, it may be as
well to outline some of them
here.
At the Selkirk/Keogh en-
trance to Southside there are two
pairs of doors arranged in series.

WHATEVER YOUR opinions
of Oxford University, a circular
sent to me by the Oxford
University Magazine ISIS will
do little to( improve them.
ISIS, I am told, is planning a
survey comparing the sex lives of
students at various universities
and has asked me for a rough
guide to sexual mores at IC
(a layman's guide?). From the
questions which followed one
could well believe that ISIS is
about to publish a league table
on the easiest universities to get
laid at; should the editors be
reading this, I'm sorry we didn't
reply, but put IC at the bottom
of the list, theological colleges
not excepted.
The questionnaire starts out
with a series of detailed ques-
tions such as 'How many abstain
from sex on religious or moral
EDITORIAL
Summertime, and the living is easy...according to Porgy and
Bess anyway, but they never had exams to put up with. For
the rest of us, long summer evenings and warm weather bring
the time of year when a young man's thoughts turn to hard
work, and consequently there are far fewer staff keen to
devote their every spare minute to working on FELIX.
The moral is that for those of you who don't have exams, or
who have exams very early in the term, or who don't want to
take exams particularly seriously, if you have ever
considered helping on FELIX, now is the time to volunteer.
More than ever this term we shall be needing photographers,
reviewers, writers, paste-uppers...in fact, however great or
small your ability, we can use you. Look in at the FELIX
Office at any time, but especially on Thursday evenings
when, in return for an hour's unskilled labour collating, I have
been known to buy a round of drinks.
For those of you who don't volunteer, help, or contribute in
any way this term, don't complain if FELIX gets rather
thinner than you're used to.
At present the main lock is on
the outer pair of doors. The
Union has proposed that these
doors should have the main lock
moved to the inner doors and a
Southside-network telephone
fitted in the entrance lobby
between the doors where visitors
could use it at any time. The
messengers' desk at the main
entrance should be closed and
transferred to the existing (but
unused) messengers' desk just
inside the Selkirk/Keogh doors
This would enable those doors to
be left open until midnight, or
whenever the security guards
begin their rounds; at other
times entrance would be by key
only.
The internal doors connecting
Selkirk to Tizard should be
unlocked at all times.
The Falmouth/Tizard doors
into Southside should be per-
manently on key access, while
the so-called main entrance
should be locked when the
refectory closes at 7:00pm.
The advantages of these
proposals are so obvious that
one wonders how the current
system ever came into existance.
Is there any reason for locking
the door from Selkirk to Tizard?
Why are two security guards
employed to a protect a securely
locked entrance while fifty yards
away anyone can get in by
following one of the residents?
A change in the system has been
necessary for some time now,
and the proposals Jon and
Stephen have put forward will be
welcomed by anyone who has
ever faced the frustration of
getting into Southside. The
question which must now be
asked is why has College done so
little in response. Will it take
another rape before someone
takes any notice of the Union's
suggestions?
Copy Deadline
Copy deadline is still 5:30pm on
Monday, and because there are
fewer staff in the summer it will
be even more rigid than before.
Since this coming Monday is a
Bank Holiday, though, the
deadline this week will be split:
for the Summer Term Calendar
(which will be in next week's
FELIX) the deadline is 3:30pm
today; for all other contributions
it is 10:00am on Tuesday.
Parking Permits
If anyone has a Union parking
permit which they don't use,
would they return it to Andy
Grimshaw, please.
Parties
Because of the disturbance
caused during the exam term to
students living in Beit, John
McCallion has decided not to
allow any parties in the Union
Building this term.

thanks to Tim Noyce for sparing

grounds?' 'How many virgins
arrive/leave?' 'What percentage
of boyfriends/girlfriends are
there within college?' which
assume my knowledge of IC
students' sexual habits is as
wide-ranging as it is detailed.
The questions then begin to
degenerate not only in presump-
tion, but also in accuracy of
wording. One rather quaintly
asks 'Are there any College
sleeping rules?' to which one is
tempted to reply that it is left to
individuals to decide how much
sleep they get. Another puts the
bald question 'Number of
partners?'

And if you were wondering
whether"Jhis question was meant
to be taken personally, the last
question on the list leaves no
doubt on this matter, yet still
manages to be at the same time
impertinently inquisitive, im-
mature, and astonishingly vague
as to what they really mean. It
asks 'Is your sex life better at
Imperial than at home?'
The letter, which is dated
April 18, requests a reply April
12. If anyone can get a copy of
the results of ISIS's survey, do
let me see it.
THOSE OF YOU who listen to
Radio 4's I'm Sorry I Haven't A
Clue will know that this week
and next the show is featuring
the two editions which were
recorded at IC. Shortly after the
recording had finished, the
producer, Paul Mayhew-Archer,
was rather disturbed to discover
the absence of a large metal sign
which had been erected just
outside the Concert Hall.
Obviously caught unawares
by the mascotry instinct at IC,
Mr Mayhew-Archer proceeded
to the bar where he explained his
plight to the students there, only
to be met- with firm denials of
guilt, gasps of astonishment and
incredulity that such a thing
could happen at IC, and (pre-
dictably) cries of 'I'm sorry I
haven't a clue'.
And who was the guilty party?
I can't say for certain; yet very
strong rumours around the
Union have pointed an accusing
finger at the virtuous anti-porn
crusader Michael Newman.
