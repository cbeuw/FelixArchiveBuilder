Marketing is the mainspring of modern business. It provides the focus
for a whole range of functions - Advertising, Product Development,
Sales, Finance, Manufacturing. Marketeers get major responsibility fast.
For example, a Brand Manager can be running a multi-million pound
businessthreeyears after leaving University. Not surprisingly, the
demands are high, but so are the rewards.
Procter & Gamble are recognised as world leaders in marketing. In the
UKthe company markets such household names as Ariel, Fairy Liquid,
Head & Shoulders, Pampers, Crest, Flash and Camay. We run a 5 day
Brand Management Course, which explains why marketing is so
central to business, and covers the role of the Brand Manager.
Our next course will run from 19th to 23rd September at our national
headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne. We will be inviting around 20
final year undergraduates to take part. They will participate actively in
marketing projects ranging from television advertising and instore
promotion to product development and consumer research.
The course is informal but intensive and will provide a real feel for the
dynamism and challenge of the wide range of activities which make up
a Brand Manager'sjob. All expenses will be paid.
