PHEW! WHAT A SCORCHER!
Southside will be fitted with a sauna by the start of next term if
plans put forward by the Estates are approved by the architects.
£20,000 of College money has already been allocated for this work.
The plans put to the Southside
Working Party at a meeting on
Wednesday centred around the
conversion of the old refectory
for use as a gymnasium mainly
for the martial arts societies
which at present use the old gym
in Beit. The floor is already
suitable and eventually the new-
gym will be totally enclosed;
until then the plan is to use a
curtain across one end, separat-
ing it from a table tennis room
where it will be possible to play
the game to club competition
standard—a facility so far
lacking at IC.
New changing rooms are to be
built adjoining the gymnasium,
and saunas have been included
in the plans, although these will
be attached to the relevant
changing rooms, and so will not
be mixed. The old luggage
storage rooms will be used as a
weight-training room—all lug-
gage from Southside Halls will
have to be kept in the Linstead
basement, which is being cleared
at present, and anyone who is
storing items in the basement of
Linstead who is not a current
resident should remove them
within the next two weeks.
The next stage of the develop-
ment of the Southside basement
would probably include building
new Squash Courts in the old
Servery area. In addition
discussions about the instal-
lation of a central laundry are
under way.
All of the money for this
project is being supplied from
College rather than Union
N o . 6 4 2 H H n n n
funds, and Union representatives
have apparently received assur-
ances that the money will not be
docked from the income from
gravel mining at Harlington
sports ground, which must,
under the terms of the Govern-
ing Body, be used only for
improving sports facilities at
Imperial. Union Officers believe
that the College's motive is to
attract more students of high
calibre by improving Imperial's
sports and residence facilities.
The plans were put by Estates
Secretary Don Clark to the
Student Southside working
party, which approved them.
They will now go to *he archi-
tects, who will inform College
whether the plan is feasible
within me allocated budget. If
"o, the work is expected to start
on July 1 and finish in Septem-
ber.
It is not yet clear who would
be responsible for maintenance
of the new facilities.
Not the FELIX Spot the Ball competition, but the publicity-
conscious Paul Simion streaking along the walkway in an effort to be
first in to the new sauna.
