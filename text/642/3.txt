Flood in

was empty at the time, was filled
with steam and hot water and a

turned off. Until repairs are
carried out, the office will
operate from another room in
the same building, while Student

Cardphone
Home mm
Cardphones have been installed
in the Sherfield Building. These
telephones, the result of an
experiment started several years
ago by British Telecom, are
claimed to be more reliable than
their coin-operated counterparts.
They operate from a plastic
card, similar to a creditcard,
which can be bought from Post
Offices, some stationers and the
College Bookshop. There are
two sorts of card, costing £2 or
£10, and units of 5p are deducted
by the telephone as each call is
made, -m-
Lauwerys—
Reporting
Back
Response to the epic hundred-
page Lauwerys Residence Re-
port has been swift and equally
epic. So far Union President
Stephen Goulder has presented a
seven page document of the
Union's response to Mr Lauw-
erys's recommendations, where-
as an all-day meeting of the
Students' Residence Committee
in March generated 25 pages of
typescript. But the combined
forces of the Wardens excelled
even this with a sixteen page
document and extensive dia^
grams, including flow charts
with such titles as 'Customer and
Administrative Perspectives on
Vacation Lettings'. The main
conclusion reached in all these
reports is that there is no need
for a full time Residential
Services Manager to be ap-
pointed from the ranks of the
Grade II administrators in
Sherfield, at a salary of about
£16,000—a great deal more than
most of our academic staff
receive.
Meanwhile at Wednesday's
SRC meeting, the Welfare
Officer walked out after over an
hour of procedural wrangling
between two Wardens: the
Chairman Don Monro, Warden
of Weeks, and Paul Jowitt of
Falmouth Keogh.
