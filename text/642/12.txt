Audio Soc Demonstration
The Questar QA3 is the cheap-
est interactive loudspeaker
system on the market. At just
under £400, with over 200W of
built in amplification, they are
excellent value. Combine this
with an incredible sound quali-
ty, they may seem too good to
be true, but this is in no small
way due to the active approach,
ie the system used in profes-
sional PA systems where each
drive unit has its own amplifier.
The QA3s have one amp for the
treble and two bridged amps
for the mid/bass unit. Come
and hear for yourself, together
with big brothers the QA2s
(with 400W of built-in power)
and Questar's new pre-amp in
its first public showing.
