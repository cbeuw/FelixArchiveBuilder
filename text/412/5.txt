Camborne '76
W E L L , T H E R E is just no
place to s t a r t . Words,
handshakes, commiserations
and even tears will not hide
the fact that we lost the
bottle, 1 0 - 9 . But, everyone
who w a s there knows where
the bottle really belongs
in 1976.
The saga begins with
Chris Whitely's harakiri
tackle on Camborne's left
winger which, unfortunately,
put him out of the game
with less than ten minutes
gone. Pete Botten, being
the true " p r o f e s s i o n a l "
he i s , retired to right wing
and so this unfortunate
injury saved Cambrone from
being massacred.
After twenty minutes, we
were 7—0 down, but for the
next sixty you would have
thought it w a s Camborne who
were a man short. The
dedication, concentration and
sheer technical expertise of
our team was unforgetable.
John Coates scored a l l our
points with a well judged
penalty and a fine opportunist
try and conversion after Mike
Kilbride had caused havoc
at a shortened line-out.
T h i s report though; really
concerns the pack. Pete
Waugh's three strikes against
the head were great reward
for the front row. Pete
Kinver performed miracles
in Maul and ruck with B o b
D a v i s an excellent partner.
Steve L u m w a s definitely
line-out supremo and Mike
A n g l i n deserved better
than to be foiled only a
yard short. T h e back-row,
B i l l Richards and Mike
Kilbride, covered more
acres than a l l three of the
Camborne back-row.
T h i s being said, pride
of place must go to Simon
Dance who played a stormer
of a c a p t a i n ' s game from
scrum-half.
A l i s t a i r Baird used
Simon's superb ball to a
tee and John C o a t e s w a s the
c l a s s i e s t centre on view.
P h i l Ford and Jerry Frankpitt
would have been stars in
most teams and Steve Way man's
defence at full-back w a s
immaculate when necessary.
Those last seven minutes
after Camborne went in
front with another penalty
saw R S M surging forward.
No-one east of Redrath will
ever be convinced that B i l l
Richards d i d not score in
the corner and although we
lost, there was never a better
way to go.
Earlier in the morning
we had won the soccer
match, for the third year
running, 3—1. Captain John
McKeown and Brian Thompson
were the stars of a defence

which meant that Danny
Gurr had only spasmodically
to show how good a goal-
keeper he i s despite h i s
s i z e . D i c k Wright in mid
field skated over the ploughed
field whilst up front John
Manning played the game of
his life. H i s first goal from
M a s h ' s pass w a s a screamer
and the second w a s squeezed
in from the acutest of angles.
C h r i s s y Laughton's header for
the third goal w a s just
reward for a team d i s p l a y .
