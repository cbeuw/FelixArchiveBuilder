Military coup-Alfs
army take over ICU
Would anybody care? — it seems not.
Portugal i s s e i z e d by frenzy at the .
prospect of a free election in two months.
Back at I C , the prospect of an election
in two weeks i s greeted with a buzz of
activity and enthusiasm that makes it
seem like Waterloo Station during a
rail strike.
Well I suppose we have had free
elections for quite a while now — the
mystigue i s bound to wearoff. D i d I
say free e l e c t i o n s ? What i s free about
an election where the President,
Honorary Secretary and Deputy President
get their posts purely by virtue of
having over 20 people w i l l i n g to
sign a piece of paper.
The contest for president i s really
hotting up. Will it be N i c k Brayshaw or
w i l l it be — o h ! — s h e ' s gone. F i o n a
McGregor made a valiant but short
lived opposition to the Brayshaw
walkover which gave a few people
something to talk about for a w h i l e ,
not least, Mr Brayshaw Unfortunately,
after further consideration of her
present situation, F i o n a had to withdraw.
Surely, there i s someone e l s e about
IC w i l l i n g to stand for the posts of
Honorary Secretary and President —
surely there are a few who would
welcome a year away from academic
toil to play at p o l i t i c s . Is it just that
the " b i g n a m e s " already standing are
too daunting a prospect for the humbler
aspirants to higher e c h e l o n s of internal
p o l i t i c s ?
Is this really a college c a l l i n g for
thedemocratisationof N U S ? We have not
had a quorate union meeting for years.
A l l decisions on behalf of the 4500
members of the union are taken by a
subquorate body of a c t i v i s t s at U G M s
or e l s e by that arbitrarily representative
and motley assembly — IC Union C o u n c i l
If our own attempts at direct
democracy are so d i s m a l , will not
N U S go the same way? Is it IC students
that need taking up or IC Union? What
we need i s a representative democracy.
Or w i l l A l f ' s army s o l v e the problem
by dropping their facade of fighting
" h i g h " Christianity and reveal their
true metal by taking over I C U .
Back to the present. I forgot to
mention the election of the sabbatical
sentence shuffler for this weekly
masterpiece. There, at least, there i s
strong competition by budding journalists
for this demanding and rewarding job.
I hope you w i l l a l l turn out and vote
to give us a competent editor.
Looking slightly further ahead, there
is the little matter of finding people to
f i l l the other officers posts. It i s to be
hoped that we c a n start next year with
a full set of officers — even a bureaucracy
cannot run without its bureaucrats.
Which reminds me, if anyone h a s a
keen interest in education and the way
it i s conducted at IC and in spreading
the new gospel in the alternative
prospectus or if they have illegible
handwriting and cannot s p e l l " a c a d e m i c " ,
"What i s free about an electibn
where the President, Honorary
Secretary and Deputy President
get their posts purely by virtue
of having over 2 0 people
willing to sign a piece of
paper?" - Richard Parker
then they ought to think about the a l l
action job of A c a d e m i c A f f a i r s Officer.
Bernard Shaw said - " D e m o c r a c y
substitutes election by the incompetent
many for appointment by the corrupt
f e w " . Here we substitute selection
from a competent few with proscription
of an unopposed one.

hard way, from the front. IC UGM's
are functional though it seems that
there is something desired in terms of
a hook. The average IC student (is
there such a thing?) is not interested
in the troubles of this, that, and the.
other, he is more worried about the
problems facing himself. In this light
we should endeavour to bring UGM
discussion/debate/policy home, back
to IC and the troubles of little Fred,
the budding technologist, in his daily
plight of student-type existence.
Whilst on the subject of UGM's, I
believe the mode of communication for
such meetings could be improved
even more, possibly even utilising
the already present multitude of year
reps.
I believe that it is very important
for the Secretary, as with all senior
officers of ICU, to be widely known
and accepted throughout College. I
feel that I have achieved this and it
can only help me in the job.
It is much better to know the person
who you have to see over some matter
rather than having to see the Union
Secretary — a ghostly spectre residing
in the uppermost rickety tower of
the Union Building.
To finish may I say that a lot of
hard work and real interest is demanded
in order to carry off the job of Secretary
and that I am prepared to apply myself
to these ends.
Music
The Eddy Boy Band
Heavy-duty rock
And this w e e k ' s Doobie — transplants
are known a s the E d d i e Boy band. It's
only apparent at the start, where
" O h s o h a r d " has a somewhat over-
bearing resemblance to those finger-
l i c k i n ' sons of the Lone Star State.
Track two " T h e m a z e " moves into
"Chicago' territory with some s o l i d
professional playing and very smooth
guitar work by Mark Goldenberg. After
a few minutes though a sort of poppish
tedium swamps the proceedings a s
the ideas quickly dry up. They c a n
maintain the power and pace of these
early numbers through side o n e , a s i s
obviously expected of them but the
quality suffers inthe good o l d tradition
of countless other duff bands searching
for the break that will turn them into
bona-fide superstars like H e l l o or
Slik (or is it " s i c k " ? ) . T h e y ' v e got
little if anything more to offer your
earballs than i s e a s i l y available in
any reasonably sane platter emporium's
racks.
" G o o d to have you back a g a i n " ,
starting side two is another worthy power
blues with a good hook and marginally
better solo by the aforementioned
Golden b o y , but this album's a pretty
unspectacular addition to the recent
crop, with the band restrained to well
within their operating envelope, and a s
such don't pretend to be other than
yer actual heavy-duty rock 'n boogie
outfit. T h e y ' v e probably spent aeons
s o c k i n g it to would-be A l l m a n s audiences
and for this unnatural devotion to
duty have been given the opportunity
to get an album out.
On the whole, an above average,
unpretentious release from the " C h i c a g o
rock group of the year 1 9 7 4 " . H o w
prestigious that particular accolade i s
remains doubtful I (I always thought
C h i c a g o a home of the blues) but i t ' s
better than the poor B C R ' s " T u r k e y of
the year'' award.
Note: There are actually 2 minutes of
keyboard subtlety on a song c a l l e d
" M o t h e r M u s i c " sounding comparatively
refreshing.
