NICK BRAYSHAW
Proposer: K E I T H A H L E R S
A S M O S T O F Y O U w i l l , by now, have
heard, I am standing for the post of
Imperial C o l l e g e Union P r e s i d e n t for the
coming academic year 1976—77. However,
what many of you may not be conversant
with, are my reasons for standing for
the post, and what I would like to a c h i e v e
during m y y e a r of office.
F i r s t l y , I would l i k e to explain my
present position within C o l l e g e and
why I consider I am the best suited
person for the job at the present time.
B e i n g president of a C C U involves me
i n a great deal of U n i o n b u s i n e s s , both
as a representative of my own U n i o n ,
and a l s o as a V i c e - P r e s i d e n t of Imperial
C o l l e g e U n i o n .
A s an I C U V P , I am of course a
member of the I O E x e c u t i v e , I C C o u n c i l ,
I C U n i o n F i n a n c e Committee, and many
more committees too numerous to mention,
but a l l giving me an invaluable insight
into the running of a large and complex
body such as I C U . A l s o , I spend a great
deal of time on Imperial C o l l e g e b u s i n e s s ,
such as refectories, bars, athletics,
careers advice etc and consequently
have come to know almost a l l of the
C o l l e g e administrators by working with
them. T h i s is an invaluable aid in ful-
f i l l i n g the job of I C U P r e s i d e n t .
Another important point is that I am
well-known around C o l l e g e and so I am
able to keep (and be kept) in touch
with student opinion rather than being
an ivory tower adminsistratorf
Next, I have l i s t e d the points on which
I should l i k e to see I C U interested in/not
interested in during the coming year
(not n e c e s s a r i l y in order of merit):-
(i) In order to make Imperial C o l l e g e
Union more appealing to I C students it i s
e s s e n t i a l that I C U concerns i t s e l f with
those i s s u e s which are of importance and
relevance to the student body. In this way
I should like to see I C U become more
interested in the problems of students as a
whole, particularly IC students. Whilst
not suggesting that I C U should become
completely insular, I believe that problems
encountered by groups and countries which
are not of direct relevance to I C students
are ones which should be of secondary
importance to a students union.
(ii) Due to the fact that grants are fixed
annually, I feel that I C U must oppose
any mid-sessional increases in C o l l e g e —
provided f a c i l i t i e s (eg refectories, hall
and house rents) as this puts undue
financial pressure on students. In order
to prevent these m i d - s e s s i o n a l increases
becoming necessary, I C U most pressing
for concerted efforts to minimise h a l l and
house rents and also for increased
standards in the refectories, in order to
increase custom and make them a financially
viable proposition within I C .
(iii) N U S has b e c o m e a topic of
controversy within I C recently and the
question has arisen whether we should
remain affiliated or not. T h i s is a very
complex question with much deeper
ramifications than at first appear, such
as "If a l l the moderate colleges pull out
of N U S , then N U S w i l l become even more
left-wing than at p r e s e n t " . Although my
final opinion on N U S must be governed
by the opinions expressed at a U G M , it is
my considered opinion that the most
fruitful p o l i c y for I C U to pursue i s one
of instigating radical changes whilst
remaining within N U S , and in this way
we w i l l continue to benefit from the
services provided by N U S , and at the
same time trying to alter the structure
of the N U S hierarchy.
A s w e l l as the points I have outlined
above, many more topics are of critical
importance to IC students, but to hear my
v i e w s on other topics, you w i l l have to
come to the Hustings Meeting and ask
then, when I w i l l be only to glad to
give my opinions.
F i n a l l y , a l l I can say is that I am
really keen to do this job and if elected,
w i l l work for the benefit of I C students
to the best of my ability.
Candidate TONY FITZGERALD
Before considering any candidate for
the presidency one must first consider the
work of a President. One of his main
functions is to represent the students of
the c o l l e g e on a large number of
committees, within both I C U and the
C o l l e g e administration, wherein he must
give the " s t u d e n t o p i n i o n " . A s
Departmental Representative for P h y s i c s ,
i n which Department I am a third year, I
have gained experience of working
w i t h i n committees, both those c o n s i s t i n g
of students o n l y , and those having
academic staff and administrators as
members. A l s o I have had the very
necessary experience of sitting on
C o u n c i l this year. It, is obviously
important that the v i e w s put forward on
Proposer: S T E L L A G O D F R E Y
these committees are those of I C students.
A s a p o l i t i c a l moderate, who has proved
himself approachable enough to represent
student opinion within his department,
I think I would be able to represent the
majority of IC students.
In his role as " c h i e f e x e c u t i v e " of
the union, the President is the main
instigator of d i s c u s s i o n within the
union on matters relating to its p o l i c y ,
and, as s u c h , must again be responsive
to student opinion. Areas which I think
are relevant to IC students and my
opinions on them are l a i d out b e l o w .
N U S , forms a major i s s u e at the
moment and, whilst it is unrepresentative
of student opinion, remaining within a
national representative body i s in our
interests, in my opinion. In this way we
should strive to change any p o l i c i e s
we disagree with from within N U S — this
being obviously impossible from without.
C o n s i s t e n t with this, I should like to
see the External Affairs O f f i c e r ' s
work being expanded. Internally, I would
like to see more done in A c a d e m i c
A f f a i r s , with a unification of what is
considered, at the moment, largely a
departmental matter. A l s o , much of the
work on committees would be aided, by
a d i s c u s s i o n of the issues to be r a i s e d ,
in F E L I X , at U G M s , and on a personal
level before the committee meets and I
would consider the generation of such
d i s c u s s i o n a major priority. Moreover, this
would mean that U G M s would be more
relevant to the individual students in
that there would be more d i s c u s s i o n of
internal matters.
Another important f a c e t of the
P r e s i d e n c y is the s o c i a l one, in that
he must attend a large number of functions
on an official b a s i s . In addition, he
should meet and be receptive to as
many students as p o s s i b l e during the
year. My penchant for " s o c i a l c h a t "
would make this part of the job l e s s
onerous. However, I am lacking a
qualification held by one of my opponents
— I have never been to an RSM B a l l !
In c o n c l u s i o n , I would like to reiterate
the necessity of electing a President you
feel can represent your v i e w s .

M A N I F E S T O S
N i g e l Miller is a first year chemist,
who, nevertheless, is not completely
new to p o l i t i c s . He was previously a
representative of A s s i s t a n t S c i e n t i f i c
Officers in the Harwell branch of the
I P C S ( C i v i l Service S c i e n t i s t s ' Union)
for a year. H e writes of this:
" T h e situation there was similar in
many ways to the situation amongst
students here. Apparent apathy and
disillusionment with the " l e f t w i n g "
U n i o n beaurocracy was a symptom of
the fact that, as for students here, the
national executive of the union seemed to
be preoccupied with various adventures
w h i c h seemed designed more to satisfy
the whims of the beaurocrats than to
serve the members' interests. T h i s was
for the I P C S , as it is for the N U S , a
result of the difficulties of organising
a group of people who have no real
economic power in the way that people
working in productive industry h a v e . "
In order to combat this w e a k n e s s , we
need a student leadership which under-
stands it, and knows how we must
therefore act. We must build a strong,
united, and democratic N U S , and reject
adventurers the Right and the far-Left
I believe my leadership can do this.
Union meetings should be better
p u b l i c i s e d in a l l the college media, and
should be on i s s u e s of importance to
students. Only this can the Union
involve its members.
I shall give full support to the media,
I C R a d i o , S T O I C , and F e l i x , and seek to
involve as many students as p o s s i b l e
in these, if necessary by being con-
troversial so that students must use
the media to reply. I shall work for
more democratic control of them,
because, after a l l , i t ' s your U n i o n , and
your media, and it is you who should
run them.
With the present inflation, we need
higher grants every year to meet the
cost of l i v i n g . I shall ensure that I C ' s
opinions are voiced in the grants campaign
and that it is e f f e c t i v e , without
unnecessarily antagonising the p u b l i c .
T h e campaign w i l l be organised to hit
home just how badly off many students
are, and, should negotiation f a i l , w i l l
not simply accept this.
Two other issues are c l o s e l y tied in
with this — the abolition of the " m e a n s
t e s t " , and the high fees charged to
overseas students. Many students
receive pitiful grants, and their parents
either w i l l not, or cannot, afford to
pay the parental contribution. A l s o we
have many foreign students at the
c o l l e g e , who have to pay much higher
fees than U K students, and who face
s o c i a l problems that the rest of us do
not. The recently announced fees
increases are a complete disaster for
many overseas students, who w i l l
find they cannot afford to pay them.
T h i s can only result in a contraction
of the college and the closure of some
courses. If you e l e c t me as president,
the Union w i l l do its utmost for people
who are hit in there w a y s , and w i l l
campaign against the c a u s e s .
Only if we resist there attacks can
IC retain its high academic standards,
and only thus can IC continue to be
recognised a s a place of learning,
whose qualifications w i l l stand us in
good stead in years to come.
If this is what you want, vote Miller

How I See The Job
T H E P O S T of Deputy P r e s i d e n t is one
of the most important and demanding
in IC U n i o n . The D P s main function
is to supervise the use and maintenance
of the Union f a c i l i t i e s , for example,
regarding the booking of rooms and
the repair and replacement of furniture
and fixtures. He i s also responsible
for the maintenance of d i s c i p l i n e and
for prosecuting offenders. The D P i s
in charge of safety and has a watching
brief over the refectory and bar. The
job also involves responsibility for
other matters such as the safety of
the Union mascot
Why I Think I Can Do The Job
' During my mis-spent time at I C ,
I have taken a constant interest in
the Union and spent a considerable
amount of time in the Union building,
notably in the refectory and bar. Over
the last year I have been External
Affairs Officer of ICU and in that
capacity I have been inyolved with
outside bodies such as the N U S . I
am at present a member of the Student
Representative C o u n c i l of the University
of London Union and V i c e - C h a i r m a n
of the Western Area of the London
Students Organisation. Within I C U
I have of course chaired the External
Affairs Committee and served on other
committees and on C o u n c i l . My experience
on the Union F i n a n c e Committee
should be of particular use of a Deputy
President. I believe that my experience
of C o u n c i l and committees should
enable me to cope with the bureaucracy
of the job, which I hope I c a n reduce
a bit.
I hope that during my year as D P
I s h a l l be able to get more students
involved in one way or another with
the Union and using i t s f a c i l i t i e s ,
and I hope that those f a c i l i t i e s can
be improved. *'

A Word About P o l i t i c s
A s well as the functions of the
D P outlined above, I hope to make a
useful Contribution on the Union
E x e c u t i v e and on C o u n c i l . I would
also like to continue with the work
I have started this year in the N U S
because I think there is a great d e a l
of work which must be done to improve
this organisation; and by that I do
not mean replacing the present dominant
p o l i t i c a l clique with a different one.
F o r those of you who are interested,
my • own p o l i t i c a l • v i e w s are fairly
straightforward L i b e r a l i s m . I. b e l i e v e
in free trade, the mixed economy,
representative democracy, the freedom
of the individual and I advocate a
federal Britain in a F e d e r a l Europe.
I am opposed to any increase in the
power of the state such as i s advocated
by the extreme left and by the extreme
right.
I want to see a grant for a l l students
sufficient to enable them to study
for 52 weeks in each year. I would
like to see N U S do more for s p e c i f i c
groups of students such as Overseas
students, who are a large proportion
of* students at this c o l l e g e , and for
d i s a b l e d students. I am quite prepared
to answer any questions you might
have about p o l i t i c s at the hustings;
see you there!
