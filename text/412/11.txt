IC cruise to victory
T h i s i s a story of nineteen
pots, twelve hats and tee
shirts, nine ties, two trophies
and a harp. It a l l took place
on the river at Reading
where the IC Boat C l u b
won three of the s i x events
and collected the above
mentioned items.
The days racing began
disappointingly with the
N o v i c e s losing a hard fought
race against Reading by a
length and a half. Reading then
went on to w i n their two
other races e a s i l y , s o in
fact, the n o v i c e s d i d quite
w e l l .
The second eight had
a field d a y ; they won a l l
their races by more than
three lengths. R a c i n g against
Reading 2nd VIII R o b Quinn
took the crew a l l the way
round the outside of the
final bend, a sporting gesture
from a crew which w a s
eight lengths ahead. T h i s
rather set the pattern of
their day.
Rowing in on o u t s i z e boat
the ladies lost to Cambridge
second eight who went on to
win the final e a s i l y . Another
case of an IC crew meeting
the eventual winners in
first round.
The firsts* went for a
warm up before the race. A s
they came in a B a l l i o l
oarsmen w a s heard to remark
'I suppose that's their
fifth eight and they still
look better than the (Oxford)
blue boat'. T h e first heat
was against Reading 1st who
went a length up at the
start but I C , in a slightly
uneasy stride came back
and gained a length. A n
uninspiring race followed
and the firsts won by a length
and a half. In the final
they met B a l l i o l and Oriel
('I thought Oriel w a s a soap
powder until I went to
Reading'). T h e three crews
were still level after the
start and during the stride,
IC pulled away from B a l l i o l
and after a good s o l i d row
beat Oriel by three lengths.
When Andy Bay I is passed
the finishing post in the
s c u l l i n g competition, the
judges had to be reminded that
the race was s t i l l in progress
because two minutes later
h i s opposition came in
sight. Later Andy turned back
up stream to f i n i s h the outing.
A s promised, P h i l s '
party at the Boat house turned
out to be a Memorable
O c c a s i o n with much merriment
and swimming.

E v e r S o Q u i c k !
F O L L O W I N G last w e e k ' s
article " W h e n , O h W h e n " ,
M i s s P a m e l a Johnston, the
Union R e c e p t i o n i s t , has
been transferred from her
position in the hallway of
the Union B u i l d i n g to the
U n i o n O f f i c e . Immediately
F E L I X w a s released, it
appears, a worker w a s sent
to " s i z e u p " the j o b , and by
Wednesday the telephone
had been transferred. She
moved to her new desk
yesterday (Thursday).
A l l messages for R C C s ,
S C C s and A C C s w i l l now be
left on the noticeboard outside
the Union Office, not, a s ,
previously, in the Lower
Lounge.
Pam s a i d of the change:
"/ feel like a new girl now.
But it's obviously a belter
arrangement — Jen and I can
help each other out now. I
think I'll miss the 'Wednesday
Pardade' of sports teams,
though." She w i l l now have
five telephones to contend
with: " / am sure that one
day they will all ring at
once."
(We apologise for both
confusing M i s s Johnston's
marital status and misspelling
her name in the last w e e k ' s
article.)

No To Disaffiliation
p o s s i b l e . N U S , he said, could
not be changed from w i t h i n .
" T h e domination of the
Broad Left dates from the
late ' 6 0 ' s and the organisation
(NUS) i s now so deeply
entrenched in the U n i o n ' s
structure that yearly sabbatical
officers of ordinary student
unions c a n have little
i m p a c t " , he s a i d .
R e p l y i n g to the statement
that organisations such as
the Federation of Conservative
Students wished to remain
in N U S , he pointed out that
these were p o l i t i c a l bodies
which wanted p o l i t i c a l
power. T o those people who
wanted to stay in because of
the services such as
E n d s l e i g h , he said that
these services were available
to most members of the
p u b l i c .
C o n c l u d i n g , he conceded
that students needed a
Atonal negotiating body,
but one which was respected,
and p o l i t i c a l .
Several members spoke
on the motion, including
Mr N i g e l M i l l e r , a presidential
candidate, who thought that
d i s a f f i l i a t i o n would be a
c a t a s t r o p ' i y " .
