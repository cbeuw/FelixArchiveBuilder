ON S U N D A Y a motley
collection of c o l d s , hangovers,
girlfriends and a dog journeyed
to North park Wood near
Pu I borough for the saxons
club event. The network of
paths, the lack of dense
undergrowth, gorse bushes
and other n a s t i e s , made the
courses very fast. However
some of the controls were
awkwardly sited in pools,
ditches and under plank
bridges. So A l a n Leakey, who
had his control card pinned
to his chest, had to assume
some od'-i postures, not
normally associated with
people in their right minds,
in order to punch his card.
In spite of this disadvantage,
A l a n finished 5th on the
8.7km ' A ' course in 69mins,
which is his highest ever
position in senior competition.
Rob A l l i n s o n also did well
to finish 9th, only half a
minute slower; this was also
h i s best ever p l a c i n g . On
the B course, 6.6km, Ian
I sherwood showed great
improvement over previous
outings and came 30th in
92 mins. Len Fawcett also
improved in coming 17th
on the C course; 4.9km, in
71 mins. The two cross-
country stalwarts, Steve
Webb and 'Iron Man' Pete
Johnson, acted with great
chivalry (possibly under
orders), and took the soft
option by escorting the
ladies round the C course,
to give t h e m a gentle
introduction to the sport.
Steve and Karen completed
the course in 91 minutes,
but Pete and J o were less
s u c c e s s f u l . They were
accompanied by N e l l , the
dalmatian who narrowly
defeated Mike We I ford in the
elections for club mascot.
After a good start, they
wasted a lot of time after
overshooting one of the
controls, and eventually
dropped out after completing
80% of the course, because
of the rapid approach of
c l o s i n g time. They have
however high hopes of
completing courses in the
future given earlier start
times. N e l l did not enter
completely into the spirit
of the sport: at one point she
refused point blank to walk
through some brambles and
had to be carried.
T e c h n i c a l l y the hardest
orienteering of the day was
in finding the nearest real
pub, with inadequate directions
and map. Only one of the
cars completed the course
in time, significantly the car
containing the most successful
orienteers and determined
drinkers. They were rewarded
by some fine King and Barnes
ale.
Meanwhile David Rosen
was having a busy weekend
in the North. On Saturday he
came a very c l o s e 2nd as
an Oxford past competitor in
the Varsity match near
Blackburn, and on Sunday
he came 4th in the snow at
the Delamere trophy event
near M a c c l e s f i e l d in a high
c l a s s field.
F i n a l l y on Wednesday
the 25th F e b , the club are
holding an event in Richmond
Park. Anyone remotely
interested in orienteering is
very welcome, and this event
is particularly suitable as
an Introduction for beginners.
A party will leave the Union
at 1.00pm, for further details
see the club notice board, to
the right of the stairs in the
Union main entrance.

IC'S First
Defeat
A run of s u c c e s s e s was
brought to an end when IC
Darts C l u b lost last Tuesday.
T h i s was a return match after
IC had already won an
exciting game at C O L P . S o ,
IC started confidently and
managed to win the first
game of 1001. However
IC started to slip and after
two games of 501 were 2—1
down and following the
doubles were s t i l l one down
at 4—3. Everything depended
on the singles and the
pressure was on. A s is
customary, so it seems, the
captain lost the first single
after starting s l o w l y . The
second single also went
C O L P ' s way when N e i l was
unable to get the finishing
double after leaving his
opponent at the start. After
this things started to improve
for IC until again we were
just one behind C O L P at
7 - 6 . However after a very
good try L i z was unlucky to
lose, so giving the match to
C O L P , through no fault of
her own. P a u l a won the
last game as a consolation
to give the final result of 8—7.
Team: M Gibson, N Rust, J
Ford, J Halsey, A Slack, Ian,
L Macklnnon, P Whitlock.

A must for every rugby-
blooded person. IC 1st X V
have reached the Gutteridge
Cup F i n a l on Saturday
28th to be played at Motspur
Park after a 14—0 victory
against Q M C . Before the
report, a big 'thank you' to
all the supporters out there
at Harlington to cheer us on.
After 'My Son P a u l ' won
the toss IC played against the
wind (although it was mostly
across the pitch). The' first
ten to fifteen minutes was
the kind of start to any
semi-final, crunching t a c k l e s ,
with no side dominating
completely. The height,
weight and strength of the
IC team began to tell us the
half progressed with fine
clearance kicking by the
backs.
IC began to put the smaller
QMC side under more and
more pressure and the
inevitable score came after
25 minutes. ' M a s s i v e ' Keith
Lipscombe a b s o r b e d a
clearance punt in his gut
from three yards, shrugged
off at least three tackles
and slipped the ball to P h i l
Turley who powered over
the line for an unconverted
try.
The game then came alive
and IC were on the boil as
never before this season.
Great rucking by the pack
IC won four consecutive
loose rucks and completely
disorganised the Q M C ' s
defence. The backs moved the
ball quickly 'Martin Bo-cock'
beat h i s man drew the
winger and fed Zappa on
the wing who darted through
for the second try.
IC were really on top
now and shortly afterwards
the third try was run in.
An overlap developed from
nothing and Mark West on
the other wing scored the
try. The conversion made the
score 1 4 - 0 and for the last
ten minutes Q M C were given
heart as IC sat back on
their lead, going badly off
the boil up to half-time.
The second half was a
disappointment, with a
weakened Q M C pack matching
IC who did enough to stop
them scoring but could not
break through to score
themselves.
Team: B Finney, M West, M
Cotter, B Stern, A Williams, A
Devaney, T Fearn, R Doyle, B
Austin, I Maclain, S Booth,

Crushed by Colts
Imperial College A ' s 0 Streatham and Croyden C o l t s : 22
THIS W E E K the A ' s travelled
south to play the Streatham
and Croydon C l u b ' s colt s i d e .
They turned out to be a
youth s i d e . Having won the
toss, the A ' s elected to play
up the (about one-in-four)
h i l l , the idea being to defend
in the first half and then to
use the hill for an attack in
the second. A s it turned out
the A ' s spent seventy
minutes in defence! The best
laid plans etc etc.
The first try came early.
The ball was won in the
scrum but bounced free
eluding two A ' s players,
but, unfortunately, not the
Streatham player who s c o r e d *
That was converted. Another
mistake enabled Streatham to
stretch their lead to 1 0 - 0 at
half time. The A ' s were
looking forward to playing
down h i l l , but a l a s it was
more downfall than down hill
for the A ' s . Before the A ' s
could exploit the advantage of
the slope another try had
been conceded. However, the
team did not give up and there
were long periods of intense
pressure most of which were
withstood by the A ' s . John
Thomas, had a good debut,
at scrum half, saving the
situation many times by
his a c c u r a t e passing.
Ironically, the A ' s looked
more threatening in this
half but, nevertheless,
were continually pinned
back by the good k i c k i n g
of the Streatham side.
So, in the end there was
defeat. But never mind the
score, the A ' s put a lot- of
effort into the game, and,
although it was not such a
good team performance as
last week, the A ' s were not
disgraced. John Day had a
good game at hooker in
spite of being kicked in the
head by Rich Jenner early
in the first half. Steve
Downing has also earned
himself a complimentary
mention.
The memorable event of the
day was when the reason for
the delay of the departure
of the team from the Streatham
club house was discovered.
They were a l l upstairs
watching 'Doctor Who'.

C Becque, M Gibson, L
