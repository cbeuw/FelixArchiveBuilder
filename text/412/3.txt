C L I V E D E W E Y is a third y e a r
mathematician who has spent the
past two years heavily involved in
student journalism. T h i s year he has
been I C U P u b l i c i t y Officer, consolidating
h i s expereince on offset-Iitho.
T o do this very demanding job,
the Editor of F E L I X must in my view,
have certain prerequisites. F i r s t l y ,
the Editormust be technically compentent.
He must have a far-reaching knowledge
of offset-litho — its advantages,
limitations, versatility, drawbacks,
everything. Secondly, the E d i t o r must
be au fait with how both the Union
and the College function. He must be
more than familiar with the structure,
hierarchy and the bureaucracy of both
IC and I C U .
Additionally, the Editor must be
a competent writer, and it helps
immensely if he is familiar with the
multitude of personalities, characters,
individuals which make up the C o l l e g e
and the U n i o n .
I believe ( l i v e Dewey f u l f i l s these
criteria outstandingly and better than
any other candidate. H i s technical
competence speaks for itself if you
have seen the excellent U n i o n publicity
which he has produced. It is by far
the best publicity the Union has seen
in a long time. H i s involvement in the
Union in the past two years can hardly
have gone unnoticed. He has often
observed on C o u n c i l , regularly attends
UGMs and his involvement in I C
Radio has taken him to the depths of
the Sherfield B u i l d i n g . He has written
a great deal for Sennet, which gave
him a very valuable insight into student
journalism. He i s familiar with the
vast majority of Union and C o l l e g e
officers. Just look at h i s list of
seconders, if you get the c h a n c e .
Despite the differences that he and
I have had in the past, it remains
abundantly clear to me that C l i v e
Dewey is the most capable candidate
for the job of F E L I X Editor. A s an
ex-Editor myself, I feel a very simple
moral obligation to support the candidate
whom I feel is going to do the best
job.
Acting in the best interests of
F E L I X must transcend all personal
c o n f l i c t s . B y doing so, one is acting
in the best interests of the U n i o n ; and
one will be furthering those important
interests by voting for C l i v e D e w e y .
Mike Williams, F E L I X Editor 1974-75
B r i e f l y , under my editorsnip
would like F E L I X to become a regular
sixteen-pager, with a weekly four - page
E n t s / A r t s pull-out supplement. T h i s
would include the Wotzon column.
My fairly extensive experience in
getting advertising would hold me in
good stead; £100 a week i s not p i e - i n -
the-sky when you know how to get
it, and that is what I intend to do.
More in-depth features, more copyreaders,
and better layout are other areas of
planned expansion. However, the
first priority w i l l always be news, more
of it, and more follow-up s t o r i e s .
To conclude, if elected, I shall
make F E L I X better than ever. That's
a promise.

M A N Y P E O P L E think of the Editor as
the person who produces F E L I X . T h i s
is only partly true, since he relies
heavily on the co-operation and good
w i l l of two paid staff and the voluntary
help of students.
Duncan Suss has the support of
all this year's F E L I X staff. They have
a l l agreed to remain with the paper if
he is e l e c t e d . At the start of every
year a hard core of experienced staff
is essential — w i t h o u t them the
production of the paper would be
seriously hampered. F o r this p o s i t i o n ,
past experience of how F E L I X runs i s
necessary. Duncan has contributed
articles to F E L I X ; as technical a s s i s t a n t
he gained an intricate knowledge of
the problems and techniques of offset—
L i t h o printing, and as B u s i n e s s Manager
he has acquired the necessary a b i l i t i e s
to run the paper's f i n a n c e s and
advertising.
Duncan has many new, practical
ideas, which if implemented would
improve the quality of your paper.
More importantly, he has the common-
sense ability to carry them out. H i s
unpretentious approach, coupled with
a realistic understanding of what is
p o s s i b l e , makes him the ideal choice
for next year's Editor.
Mark C a l d w e l l , Chairman of S T O I C .
T O F U L F I L L ITS R O L E , F E L I X must
reflect the interests of its readers.
A good coverage of student affairs
is e s s e n t i a l , particularly on those
matters which concern students directly,
such as refectory prices and h a l l
fees. Room must also be found for
articles on c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s so as
to arouse interest in them and ensure
their continued e x i s t e n c e . T h i s would
also encourage local b u s i n e s s e s to
advertise in F E L I X — if a feature on
a particular club was planned, any
suppliers in the district could be
approached with more confidence in
the, at present, unfavourable climate.
It is also important that both overseas
students and postgraduates be encouraged
to contribute more to F E L I X . After
a l l , they each constitute w e l l over
20% of the population of I C . The lack
of a regular article for overseas students
has been a noticeable failing of this
y e a r ' s F E L I X , , and in the last five
i s s u e s , only one article has been
s p e c i f i c a l l y related to P G s .
So, my plans can be stated quite
simply:
(1) to maintain the support of the
absolutely crucial staff of F E L I X ,
(2) to encourage students' societies
to utilise F E L I X to a greater extent, and
(3) to make students more aware of
the i s s u e s which affect them.
A l l of these objectives are r e a l i s t i c ,
all can be achieved, and a l l of them
w i l l benefit F E L I X and I C U .
