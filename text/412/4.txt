Legal Aid-at court
English courts are divided
into c i v i l criminal courts. The
Scottish system is similar.
C i v i l courts
Most c i v i l c a s e s are heard
in the County Courts. Each
of these covers a certain
area of the country (not
usually a countyl). They
deal with disputes over
items worth less than £1,000
and possession actions on
most houses and flats. T h e
judicial work is carried out
by a circuit judge and a
registrar, who doubles a s
an assistant judge and
deals with small c l a i m s .
Small claims (less than
£100) may now be brought
without a lawyer. Y o u pay
£5 which is returned if you
win the c a s e .
The High Court Situated
in the Strand takes any c a s e
over the C o u n t y Court
financial limit. A p p e a l s from
the County or High courts go,
firstly to the Court of
A p p e a l , and then, finally to
the House of L o r d s .
Criminal courts
Criminal proceedings begin
at a Magistrates' Court. T h i s
Court will have a bench of
three lay magistrates, or in
large c i t i e s , one full-time
panel magistrate. Se(ious c a s e s
are committed to rail by
jury at the area's Crown
Court either automatically
or at the accused person's
request. The Central Criminal
Court (the O l d Bailey) deals
with major trials and c a s e s
where the person might get
an unfair hearing locally.
Tribunals
Due to the length of time
of court procedures, tribunals
have been set up to deal with
such problemsassupplementary
benefit appeals, rents and
national insurance. These
are intended to be quick and
informal and are not in
g e n e r a l judged by a
professional lawyer.
Lawyers
The legal profession is
divided into s o l i c i t o r s and
barristers. Solicitors are
members of the L a w Society
and can appear in Magistrates
and county courts but not in
the higher courts. Barristers
can appear in a l l courts, but
are not allowed to deal
directly with a client. They
must be " i n s t r u c t e d " by
a solicitor. A l l barristers
are members of one of the
Inns of Court and their
professional body is the
General C o u n c i l of the B a r .
Judges in the Crown and
Central Criminal courts are
usually barristers.
C i v i l legal A i d
No legal a i d is available
for tribunals. T o obtain
legal aid at a c i v i l court, you
apply for a " l e g a l a i d cert-
i f i c a t e " through a solicitor.
The application is considered
by the local committee of
the L a w Society. They w i l l
consider whether you have
" r e a s o n a b l e grounds" for
bringing or defending the
c a s e . There is a right of
appeal to the S o c i e t y ' s
area committee if you are
turned down.
Financial eligibility
D i s p o s a b l e capital and
income are worked out in a
similar fashion to the legal
advice scheme described
last week. That i s , disposable
income is equivalent to
gross income less allowances
and disposable capital is
equivalent to gross capital
less debts.
In this case, however,
disposable, income is c a l -
culated on a yearly b a s i s and
aid is not given if this
is greater than £1,580 per
annum. A i d is only free if
your disposable income is
less than £500 per annum
and your disposable capital
is less than £250. Above this
you pay a contribution.
The maximum value of this
contribution is calculated a s
the amount by which your
capital exceeds £250 plus
a third of the amount by
which the disposable income
exceeds £500 a year. Should
the actual costs fall below
this sum, the balance is
returned to y o u , while if the
costs are higher, the balance
is paid from the Legal A i d
Fund. T h e contribution is
payable in instalments.
If you win the case and
are awarded costs, part of
your contribution may be
returned. Alternatively, if
you lose and costs are
awarded to the other side,
you may be asked for an
extra contribution. Moreover,
if you win and the total
c o s t s are quite considerable
or you are awarded damages,
and not c o s t s , the Legal
A i d Fund has the right of a
"Statutory c h a r g e " from
the damages you receive.
Criminal Legal A i d
T h i s is only available to
persons charged with a
criminal offence and not to
those prosecuting. T h e
financial limits are not
quite a s restrictive a s in the
c a s e of C i v i l Legal A i d
although one is still liable
to a means test. T o obtain
criminal legal aid you apply
for a " l e g a l aid o r d e r " ,
either to the clerk of the
court itself. After a s s e s s i n g
your means, the court w i l l
decide whether you are
liable to pay a contribution
or not.
From then on you are
entitled to the services of
a solicitor and barrister
if required. The solicitor can
be of your own choice.
The legal aid order also
includes advice on appealing
if found guiIty.
F i n a l l y , anyone charged
with an offence would
immediately s e e k legal
advice either from a solicitor,
C i t i z e n s A d v i c e Bureau or
L a w Centre. P l e a s e contact
the welfare Centre for useful
addresses, more information
and if you wish to talk to the
U n i o n ' s Solicitor. We are
open 12.30 — 1.30pm, Mondays
to F r i d a y s , at the top of the
Union B u i l d i n g .

LETTER
Deprived of
Union facilities
Sir, — We wonder, on the
day that Pete Teague is
quoted as saying " t h e
Union is for s t u d e n t s " ,
the depth to which this
statement extends.
Last Friday night we
wished to play snooker on
the Union tables, but we
rated our chances low,
because the tables are
always in great demand;
but hope! the lights were
off. What chance lay on
the horizon? None, the
D P , Mr (IC is a c l i q u i s h
College) Shakir, had had the
doors locked because of
" f l a m b o y a n t " behaviour by
the Snooker C l u b .
We were deprived of
Union facilities owing to a
personal grudge between
the D P and certain members
of the Snooker C l u b .
Should this situation be
tolerated in a students'
Union, should such action
as that of our refurbished
Deputy President go unreported
in F E L I X ?
We think not.
When challenged, in the
Union Bar, Mr Shakir said
What an Increase!
The F i n a n c e and Executive
Committees of the Governing
Body will be deciding, a s
you read this F E L I X whether
to increase the college
tuition fees and by how
much. The Department of
Education and Science has
recommended an increase in
fees of thirty percent, and
the C o l l e g e is almost certain
to follow this guideline.
T h i s will mean that next
year the fees for under-
graduates w i l l be £211 for
U K students and £426 for
Overseas Students, increases
of £46 and £96 respectively.
F e e s for postgraduates w i l l
be ten pounds less in each
c a s e .
If the C o l l e g e does not
increase the fees next year
then they will loose that
amount of money from their
grant from the U n i v e r s i t i e s
Grants Committee, a s they
w i l l assume that our fees
have gone up. Does the
C o l l e g e have any choice
therefore? The total income
" t h e innocent a l w a y s
s u f f e r " .
Yours faithfully,
J L A T T E R , C M I L L S . C E 3
to the C o l l e g e from student
fees was only 2.8% of the
C o l l e g e ' s total income. The
majority of this money is
paid by local authorities,
foreign governments, or the
B r i t i s h C o u n c i l . Self —
supporting students pay their
own fees and this makes up
the balance. These students
who come from both the
U K and Overseas are the
people hit hardest by any
fees increase. Could the
C o l l e g e waive the fee increase
in the c a s e of self-supporting
students. T h e students
paying their own fees number
about 1,000 and their fees
represent about 0.7% of the
C o l l e g e ' s income.
The loss of income to
the C o l l e g e is quite s m a l l ,
but the hardship caused to
students paying their own
fees w i l l be considerable
particularly if the hardship
arrangements which operated
last year are not continued
fullv this vear.
Breakfasts and Weekends
The Refectory Committee
has decided that a change
in breakfast and weekend
working is required to try
and put these services on a
more economic b a s i s . The
choice available at breakfast
w i l l be more limited and
the service w i l l be moved to
the snack bar in southside. To
cut c o s t s on the weekend
service, it i s intended to
change to a snack service
similar to that provided in
the Union during the week.
T h i s will mean that less
staff need be employed and
hence cut c o s t s . I hope that
you will make full use of
these new ideas, particularly
as the refectory intends to
stay open for much longer
at weekends.
Elections
Perhaps I should not say
anything a s I was elected
unopposed but the lack of
candidates is really appalling.
I am pleased to say that
there are now several candidates
for President and F E L I X
Editor but the Hon Sec and
Deputy President E l e c t i o n s
are still unopposed. If you
feel that you could do the
job then stand!! If you
cannot be bothered to put
out a campaign and spend
two weeks trying to get the
job, then you do not deserve
it.
