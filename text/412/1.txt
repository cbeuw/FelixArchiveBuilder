Don't want to lose you - Clarke
No to disaffiliation
But I think we ought to go - Teague
S T U D E N T S A T T E N D I N G
the debate on N U S in the
Great H a l l , yesterday,
voted, by a n a r r o w
majority, in favour of
Imperial College Union
remaining w i t h i n the
National Union of Students
(NUS)'. T h e voting was
195 to 146 to stay in with
63 abstentions.
The meeting, attended by
nearly 450 students, w a s the
largest of its kind in recent
years. The motion d i s c u s s e d
was in two parts, the first
noted the unrepresentative
nature of the national union
and the second expressed
the view that disaffiliation
was the only way to ensure
that N U S . becomes more
representative of the student
members.
T h e first part of the
motion w a s overwhelmingly
carried.
Ian M i n n i s , President of
Aston U n i v e r s U y G u i l d of
Students, who w a s originally
going to speak i n favour of
d i s a f f i l i a t i o n , d i d not turn
up because of a misunder-
standing over the time at
which the debate w a s
supposed to begin.
He w a s replaced by Peter
Teague, I C U President, who
debated against Charles
C l a r k e , N U S President.
Mr Clarke opened the
debate amidst much heckling
and began by reiterating the
problems facing students
and cited the N U S ' s record in
dealing with them. Only
N U S , he s a i d , could organise
a national, concerted effort
to affect Government p o l i c i e s .
Admitting that, at the
moment, N U S were " o n the
d e f e n s i v e " , he stated h i s
belief that " b y organisation
students can change t h i n g s " .
"It was no accident", h e
pointed out, "that NUS is
the strongest student union
in Europe. Britain is the only
country where student loans
are not given. We are living
in a society where instability,
not stability is the order
of the day. Things which up
to now have been taken for
granted,are being challenged",
he said.
On the question of
democracy within N U S , he
emphasised t h a t this
depended crucially on the
representative nature of
individual student unions.
The only way to change N U S
was from within these
student unions, by the
involvement of a l l members
in campaigns.
Mr Teague, i n h i s reply
said the N U S w a s inherently
unrepresentative because of
its structure. The organisation
was based on " a c t i v e
d e m o c r a c y " . Only p o l i t i c a l
a c t i v i s t s attended the
n e c e s s a r y U G M ' s and
conferences, so only the
opinions of these activists
were represented.
C r i t i c i s i n g the domination
of the N U S executive by the
Broad Left, he blamed the
widely p u b l i c i s e d p o l i t i c a l
opinions of the national
executive for the bad
public image of students.
He believed that students
needed a national negotiating
body, but this body should
be apolitical as far a s

RCS recover shields
ICWA challenge Exec
ICWA hereby challenge the
Imperial C o l l e g e Union
E x e c u t i v e to a pancake
race round the Beit Quadrangle
on Tuesday 2nd March at
1.00pm, the match to be
refereed by the F E L I X
Editor, P a u l Ekpenyong.
Chris ' Morrell with the
T H E SIX G U I L D S shields
stolen last term were returned
to the C & G Union last night
during the R C S sketch at the
G u i l d s Revue.
The s h i e l d s , valued at
over £2000, were recovered
from a locked cupboard i n
the University C o l l e g e Union
by members of the Royal
College of Science Union
last week. They h a d been
waiting for an opportune
moment to return the s h i e l d s .
Guilds* Shields.
A spokesman for R C S U said
the shields were being returned
as a goodwill gesture.
Members o f R C S U , last year,
removed some of the s h i e l d s
after Guilds h a d stolen
T h e t a at the Mathematics
F r e s h e r s ' Dinner.
The recovery came after
members of R C S U h a d drawn
the attention of G u i l d s to
an article i n P I , the University
C o l l e g e newspaper, claiming
that U C were i n p o s s e s s i o n
of the s h i e l d s .
Refectory
services
slashed
T H E B R E A K F A S T and
weekend meals s e r v i c e s in
Southside are to be drastically
reduced i n a n attempt to
reduce the refectory deficit.
The d e c i s i o n w a s taken by
the refectory committee under
the chairmanship of D r J F
L e v y , after much d i s c u s s i o n
with Mr Mooney, the refectory
manager.
Mr Mooney put several
proposals to the committee,
which the committee decided
to implement. A s a result,
from Monday 23rd February,
only one cooked dish w i l l
be available for breakfast
(eggs and bacon). T h i s w i l l
enable a reduction o f staff
and a consequent saving of
money.
From Saturday 28th
February, the weekend meals
service w h i c h , at present i s
making a l o s s of £75 p e r
weekend, w i l l be reduced.
The full s c a l e menu w i l l be
discontinued a n d i n i t s
place a menu similar to that
offered i n the Union refectory
on week days w i l l be sub-
stituted. Here too, ft i s
hoped to reduce kitchen
staff and save money.
T h e new service w i l l
require the purchase of a
convection oven and more
storage space, the total cost
of which is expected to be
approximately £1000.
Labour charges are the
main factor i n the cost of
running the refectories,
hence it i s i n this area
that economies are to be
concenrtated, but there may
be friction with the U n i o n
concerned over reduction i n
staff.
