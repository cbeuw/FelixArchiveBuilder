'Man Friday' ('A' Carlton, Haymarket.)
D O N ' T B E F O O L E D by the jolly
posters and jokey radio ads — the
commercial ' D i s n e y image' is a facade
behind which lurks a pretty heavy
story. F o r the benefit of those lured
in expectation of easy-going entertain-
ment, there are plenty of jolly japes —
some of them very amusing — and the
Mexican scenery is very n i c e . Meanwhile,
Daniel Defoe having been thrown out of
the window after the first two minutes,
'Man Friday' reveals itself as a vehicle
for filming the biggest ethnical c l a s h
of all time.
Unfortunately the characters turn
out to be just too black and white (sorry!).
Friday (Richard Roundtree) comes from
i d y l l i c , s o c i a l i s t U t o p i a where
prejudices, taboos, status, and even
Defoe discarded
competitive games, are inconceiveable
concepts. Crusoe (played by Peter
O'toole) despite twelve lonely years
thinking, remains the complete antithesis
of this: as the all-white, God-fearing,
self-castigating master, he is determined
to 'educate' Friday — .and remain his
master. Inconsistency" runs through
the film; Crusoe (who has built a
stockade like Fort Knox, complete with
automatic drawbridge) makes a pathetic
attempt at building a raft on which they
hope to escape to Fridays island-
predictably it s i n k s on launching.
C o n s i s t e n t l y , though, the film is
against all that the white-man stands
for, and he is progressively depicted
as a ranting maniac; a role that Mr
O'toole perfected in ' T h e R u l i n g
C l a s s ' but here seems like over-acting.
The turning point comes at the
end of a long tirade when Crusoe,
screaming about the white-mans'
" v i l e , purple b o d y " to a fettered
Friday, blows his p r e v i o u s only
companion, the parrot, to pieces in
mid-squawk. From here on, the white-
man's malignancy spreads to F r i d a y ,
who turns the gun on his 'master' and
forces him to build another boat — this
time a sea-worthy one. Together they
s a i l to F r i d a y ' s i s l a n d , but fearing
he might influence their children, he is
rejected by the tribe, and returned to
resume, once again, h i s solitary
existance on the island.
So ends another saga; one that I
enjoyed, but would have enjoyed all
the more had it reached its potential
and been constructive rather than
destructive.

Double-jigs and curious rhythms
C A T H O L O ' C O N N E L L , Robin Morton,
Ali. Bain and Dave Richardson are four
of the best traditional musicians in the
country. Individually they are superb.
Together they are " T h e B o y s of the
L o u g h " .
Cathol plays flute and whistle, and
has a fine singing v o i c e . Dave Richardson,
a Tynesider, plays stringed i n s t r u m e n t s -
banjo, cittern and mandolin — and
sometimes doubles with Robin on
concertina duets, or when Robin plays
Bobhran (Irish hand-drum). The last
member of the group, A l i B a i n , a
Shetland fiddler, is probably the best
known of the four, and is generally
considered to be one of the best fiddlers
in the country. Other than what is
absolutely essential to make themselves
heard, they use no electronic gadgetry,
and they play music the traditional
way, without altering tempos or imposing
heavy rhythms.
The a u d i e n c e was s m a l l , but
enthusiastic, and the B o y s quickly had
them warmed up with a couple of
double-jigs. In the first set, it was
mainly Cathol and A l i playing their
way fast and furious through reels and
flings, but time was found for a March
tune from A l i ' s native Shetlands, with
its curious r h y t h m and intricate
harmonies.
Then came Richard Digance, a

(not n e c e s s a r i l y in that order) who
managed quite s u c c e s s f u l l y to bore me
to death with his intros and revive me
with the noise output of his songs,
(hence the phrase " l o u d enough to
waken the d e a d " ? ) . Not really my cup
of tea, but the audience seemed to
enjoy him, and all joined in on his
final song, "Working C l a s s M i l l i o n a i r e " .
By way of returning the compliment,
e joined in with the audience, walking
amongst those between the stage and
permanent seats, looking rather like
a cockney Ghandi.
The highlight of the B o y s ' second
set was undoubtedly " T h e M a s o n ' s
A p r o n " , when first C a t h o l , and then
A l i , went into variations on the theme
and produced some of the best music
I've heard. A l s o notable, was the
p i e c e that they "put together"
themselves, " H o u n d and H a r e " , the
story of a hunt. In this, Robin opens
with two verses from a hunting song,
followed By a jig to portray the pre-
hunt warm-up. A duet between C a t h o l ,
on flute, and A l i describes vividly the
chase, capture, and finally, the k i l l .
A marvellous concert for those who
like traditional music - those who
don't might do so now if they went to
the concert. They were called back for
two encores - what more can you say?

A long road
to perfection
T h i s week I've been to see a new
play by the budding Welsh playwright,
Arthur Williams. A s in his three previous
plays, Williams presents the predicament
of a man beset with all the problems
that living in the 1970's e n t a i l . In
his first play, " T h e L i v i n g L a k e "
the hero's washing machine overflows
and floods his maisonette in Paddington.
in his following two plays the hero
s u c c e s s i v e l y was stranded in the
middle of a remote village in west Wales
when his c a r ' s fan-belt broke and
was unable to attract the stewardess'
attention on board a British A i r w a y s
Jumbo as it sped towards Johannesburg.
Whilst h i s earlier plays have some
autobiographical element in them,
" N o t Spaghetti Junction A g a i n " is
pure fantasy. The anti-hero is the
driver of a sixty-foot articulated lorry,
doomed for ever to drive the motorways
of Britain in search of the perfect
service station meal. In his travels he
meets others with a less fastidious
appetite, eager to sample the delights
of Fortes. T h e s e hitchhikers provide
a fresh dimension in a play which could
otherwise appear very boring; they
are able to bridge across the hard
shoulders of the motorway and provide
a b a s i s for meaningful relationship as
Shunt applies himself to his relentless
task. Can it be pure coincidence that
his cargo is of frozen c h i c k e n s ?
T h i s is the story of one man's
struggle against temptation on to the
B roads of life, and although he takes
several plunges towards them, it is
giving nothing away to say that he does
not end up betraying his personal
Highway Code.
