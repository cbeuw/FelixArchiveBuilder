bank by t h e i r coaches, C h a r l e s Bristow. and Derek Coomber.
The j o u r n e y upstream on the S a t u r d a y was w i t h o u t much

coaches s t r u g g l e d m a n f u l l y i n and out of the p o t h o l e s on
the tow-path between Richmond and Twickenham.

w i t h c o n s i d e r a b l e s p i r i t and., i n d e e d , were b a r e l y r e s t r a i n e d
by t h e i r coaches from rowing s t r a i g h t over the w e i r . As i t
was, t h e r e were s ome anxious moments d u r i n g w h i c h boats and
f i s h i n g l i n e s because c u r i o u s l y i n v o l v e d , and remarks were
passed between a n g l e r s and coaches which would have done

The boats were l e f t f o r the n i g h t at Molesey Rowing
