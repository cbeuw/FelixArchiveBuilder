Galaxy Weekend
Various'
(MOS)
Another top compilation from the peo-
ple at Ministry of Sound. Galaxy Week-
end is a double CD album that features
the high quality music which has made
the Galaxy radio network one of the pre-
mier networks in England. The first CD
is mixed by Boy George and is not very
good - no surprise there then. The sec-
ond CD, mixed by Allister Whitehead, is
much better featuring artists such as
Underworld, Mr Oizo, Phats & Small and
James Brown. This album is more funky
than the trance one and there's more
variation to it as it covers a huge amount
of dance music, from the classic tunes to
the underground dancefloor anthems
by some of the finest names in dance
music. If you like the music they play on
Galaxy then this album is for you.
good compilation album.
Out now.

Live at the Heavenly Jukebox Volume 3
Various'
(React)
Mixed by Andy Weatherall and Richard
Fearless, this is a high quality compilation
album featuring the music you can hear
at one of London's premier nights. Once
again it is a double CD with a huge
range of tracks mixed by the above DJs.
Lasting well over two hours it fuses fast
beats, phat bass lines and uses the full
spectrum of dance music.

Olmec Heads
'Spiritualised'
(Neo)
When Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong and
Paul Van Dyk are playing a tune, you
instantly know it is the dog's bollocks
- and that's what this tune is. This sin-
gle is a massive progressive tune
opening with some amazing 303
sounds followed by a catchy piano
beat and culminating in a massive
first break down before launching
into one of the epic tunes of the year.
There are a couple of mixes, one pro-
viding the uplifting evrsion whilst the
second gives a very deep and dark
variation. 'Spiritualised' will be one of
the hits of the summer and it's not
hard to see why.
Out 1st June.

Nightmares on Wax
'Finer'
(Warp)
Taken from the highly acclaimed 'Car-
boot Soul' album and featuring mixes
from Paul Nice and Alex Gopher this
is an excellent double 12" package.
The track itself is a very uplifting, soul-
ful ballard featuring the delicious
vocals of diva sara Winton. But the
strength of the single lies in its remixes
with hip hop and french house influ-
ences. Also featured is the much
sought after DJ spinna mix of Les
Nuits.

'Big Foot'

More high quality D&B this time on

'The Arrival' being just as good, if not
better than 'Big Foot'.

The filtered pads form the
backbone for the spritcly breaks ,
swirling sci-fi effects combined with
the melodies give a real dancefloor

which features a deeper ride through
D&B music.

Astrotrax
Y o u Are My Everything'
(White Label)
Shola Phillips provides the vocals on
this very tasty slice of MAW inspired
garage track. The 12" comes with a
quartet of remixes giving the track a
soulful, uplifting garage, house ver-
sions. The vocals are sweet and inno-
cent whilst the beats and bass lines
allow the single to flow into a dance-
floor anthem. Not your usual com-
mercial rubbish but more of your high
quality garage.

De-ryus
'Grass Ain't Greener'
(Boiler House)
Debut single from De-ryus featuring a
couple of top mixes from MJ cole and
CJ Macintosh. It's a smooth garage
track with a hint of soul to it. The cole
mix brings out the best of the silky
vocals whilst the CJ Mac. mix uses a
smooth filtering meolody with strong
drums and a deep sound. The B side
offers 'Times Together' with its great
guitar lick and laid back groove.
Out 7th June.
