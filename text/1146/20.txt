20 Sport & Crossword 24 May 1999
On a pitch far, far away (well, just next to
Heathrow in fact), 3 weeks ago, the IC
cricket team began the second consec-
utive defence of the ULU Cricket Cup.
And what a good start they made. Three
wins out of three in the preliminary group
stages, sees IC cruising into the quarter
finals for a home tie against either Royal
Holloway or LSE.
Imperial's defence of the title they
have won the past two years began with
a game against St. Georges. All the ULU
matches are 40 over limited over affairs,
but all of IC's matches so far have been
affected by rain. IC batted first against
St George's and made an impressive 230
for 5 off 35 overs, Jawwad Rasheed
(Mech Eng I) hitting 118 not out. There
was more rain and St Georges couldn't
cope with their new target, finishing on
109 for 9, ULU captain Simon Holliday
scoring a half century and Kav Patel tak-
ing 3 for 33.
IC captilised on this opening victory
the next week, by thrashing GKT 2nds. IC
made a massive 252 for 3, again off 35

overs. Jawwad, who has obviously been
watching Brian Lara's recent form, hit
the GKT attack to all parts in scoring 168
- at one point scoring 106 out of a part-
nership of 108 with Alex Wright. A shell-
shocked GKT couldn't even come close
to IC's total, being skittled out for just 76,
Kav taking 3 for 29.
The third game was a much closer
matchup against St. Bart's. The winners
would guarantee a home tie in the Quar-
terFinals, and both teams were confi-
dent of victory. A beautiful afternoon at
Harlington saw IC win the toss and score
191/9 off their 40 overs, against a Bart's
team containing only 10 fielders (they
had forgotten to bring an umpire with
them so were forced to use a fielder as
square leg umpire). Jawwad couldn't
continue his form, but he still joint top
scored with 32, sharing a 62 run part-
nership with Murali (also 32). Last wicket
pair Nigel Terry and Mark Dawkins scored
15 runs off the final over, which was to
prove crucial later on. After the tea inter-
val the players returned to a backdrop of
black clouds and lightning bolts, and the
umpire was unwilling to begin in the
potential hazardous conditions. After
an hours break, the players returned to
a soggier field, Bart's requiring 72 off 15
overs. They complained about IC
bowlers bowling more than 8 overs each,
but were rebuffed when the tules were
produced. They proceeded to spend
their innings whining on the boundary,
while a very tense match was unfolding
in the dim light out in the middle. The
medics lost their first 4 wickets cheaply
and were never able to get back ahead
of the run rate, although 16 extras con-
ceded by IC allowed them to reach 69 for
5 off their 15 overs, meaning IC won by
just 2 runs. Kav bowled unchanged from
the motorway end and captured 2 for 30,
taking his season's wicket tally to 8.
So IC proceed to the Quarter Finals,
and hope to go one better than the last
winning IC team from 1971/72, who
could not manage to capture the cup
three years on the trot It looks to be an
exciting summer ahead.
