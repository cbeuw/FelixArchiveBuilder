One line Summary:
Wise cracking gecko, rescues the girl,
gets the baddie, saves the entire planet
by tall spinning and bouncing through
this 3-D action adventure.
What's It all about:
Gex gets a urgent message. Rez is back
and this time hes gone and made it per-
sonal by kidnapping Agent Xtra (Mar-
liece Andrada - large breasted actress of
Baywatch
fame). Its once
again time for
Gex to enter
the various
themed worlds
to collect mis-
sion remote
controls in
order to unlock
her TV prison.
Yep its the
PlayStation's
favourite Mario
clone back again.
Good Graphics:
Gex once again spoils us with cartoony
fast flowing detailed animation, colour-
ful and detailed backgrounds. Mario is
really starting to look dated and slow in
comparison.
Seraphim Sounds:
Standard themed tunes for the different
areas, Chrismassy tunes for the Santa
World, Creepy Scooby music for the mys-
tery world even a Egyptian
themed tune. No big
names for the music...but
Danny John-Jules (Cat from
Red Dwarf) is the voice of
the shifty little lizard, and
amazingly enough Marliece
Andrada gets to read her
own lines.
Great Gameplay:
Gex the Gecko was annoy-
ing difficult to control and
although having had a bit of
a thought about it they have sorted out
a few things but missed others. The ana-
logue control gives a bit more of a
chance of making the long jumps, but
the damn camera angles can lead to
throwing things at the TV in anger after
missing the jump for the tenth time -
make sure you have a large supply of pil-
lows and cushions. The missions go from
the trivial to PhD problem complex and
passing through the level expected of a
solo reviewer quite soon - oh yeah kill the
Santa by flying kicking the Xmas pre-
sents obvious really - not.
Sex and Violence:
Lizard human hybrids are definatelty not
on the cards and the poster left is the
nearest we get to see any flesh. Vio-
lence is as violence does - its all car-
toony tail swishing.
Best bit:
The snowboarding and other stages like
it. Gex playing snow dude while smack-
ing evil elves with a spinning snowboard
- madness and much mirth.
Worst Bit:
The whole
repetitive
nature of the
game, each
world has
four missions
each starting
from the
same entry
point, with
the same
enemies with
the same
moves. Oh and Danny John-Jules saying
the same thing fifteen things does not
make the phrase any funnier. This is not
Vic and Bob's big night out any more.
So who will get It: Gex the Gecko play-
ers, Playstation mario converts. It's a
good 3D cartoony platform let down by
a few niggly camera angle problems
and repetitive gameplay spots, repetitive
gameplay spots, repetitive gameplay
spots....

O n e line Summary:
Voodoo bloke, no heart,
seeks evil brother to perform
nasty revenge on - please
send photo.
What's It all about:
On the eve of a marrage to
the local rival clan leader's
daughter Akuji gets the
worse of a sibling rivalry that
started when Akuji tricked
his brother into eating dog
shit or something equally
bad. Orad gets his mates to
rip out Akuji's heart condeming him to
hell and is about to sacrifice Akuji's bride-
to-be for desert. Akuji strikes a deal which
would allow him to exit the underworld
and sort out Orad good and proper -
unfortunately this deal is a bit on the
harsh side - well who said getting out of
hell was easy.
Good Graphics:
Makes Lara look dowdy and tatty. Akuji
walks, jumps, slashes his way through
his high detailed hell. The lighting effects
alone are impressive and the monsters
look very polygon like, they move fairly
quickly though.
Seraphim Sounds:
Voodoo
styled music,
the odd
whoosh of
magic,
buzzing of
monsters in
the area.
Nothing too
impressive
and defi-
nately noth-
ing out of
the ordinary.
Great Gameplay:
Lara had her two pistols up front and per-
sonal to take out the bad guys. Akuji
instead prefers to go for it claw against
claw, and has a rather sharp shaving
blade strapped on the end of his mittens.
Now while this seems a good idea for
taking on the local cats and dogs the
average hell hound comes with sharper
teeth. The solution - voodoo magic.
There is more magic down in the hell
world than a million Paul Daniels and
David Copperfields and most of it pretty
effective at stopping monsters chomping
on your cheeks. The contol method is
good - with a neat sniper mode for those
long range precision spells. Fourteen
levels will also keep the interest up. If you
are expecting lots of puzzles this isn't
really it, more a Tomb Raider 2 than 1.
Sex and Violence:
Well violence anyway, with Freddy Kruger
gloves, the ability to morph into a pan-
ther and a wide range of fire, blast and
blood drainin^
. | i. It. i :
plenty of vio-
nr ~" Best bit:
Morhing into a
panther is pretty
cool, so are some
of the nastier
spells - the poses-
sion spell allows
Akuji to take over
• the enemies
body and rattle
them till they explode. Scanners eat your
heart out - or on second thoughts.
Worst Bit:
Nothing really stands out. The monsters
can look a little bit mechanical espe-
cially when compared against Akuji's
detail and the backgrounds.
So Who will get it: 3 D Third per-
son action adventurers who
believe that Gex and Mario are
for the kids - O k the Lara Croft
crowd. Anyone who wants a
decent adult themed 3D plat-
former.
But Is It better than Gex 3 :
It hasn't got the little irritating
problems that just knock the
edge off Gex so yes.
