The Importance of Coffee
There is a lot of truth in the old joke that
mathematicians are devices for turning
coffee into theorems. In fact Kevin
believes coffee is the fuel, the raw mate-
rial for much of the work which goes on
within IC. Students can often be over-
heard talking to each other about the
effects of caffeine addiction,- withdrawal;
and as exam time approaches worrying
about the possible side effects of their
increasing caffeine intake. Two branches
of the brilliant Starbucks, within a few
minutes walk of the South Ken. campus
only encourage the habit. Kevin has
heard of some students being lucky
enough to get tutorials time tabled at
Starbucks! However due to the rather
cosy size of the place, if this becomes
common practice double bookings could
be problematic. Perhaps Starbucks
should be incorporated into the IC room
booking system, so as to ensure the
comfortable seats are free. Coffee
addicts looking for accommodation for
next year may be interested to note that
the flats above Starbucks on Kensington
High Street are up for sale at the
moment. Kevin sees this coffee culture
as quite ironic - for an institution which
was once proud to be known worldwide
as "The PG Tips College".
New Phone System
Internet access at home for all IC stu-
dents could soon be a reality. College is
presently holding dis-
cussions with the
communications
company Ericsson
over a "private
finance initiative"
which would provide
IT / Phone services to
the South Ken cam-
pus and Halls of Resi-
dence. Ericsson A Mostly Harmless Column by
stands to make a lot Kevin, a random entity who
of money out of IC knows nothing about nothing
students in the long
term, and it is vital that we as students
make sure that we get the best deal we
can. Kevin, who has experience of prob-
lematic commercial phone systems in
many institutions has the following, real-
istic wish-list: *AII phones should receive
incoming calls irrespective of whether or
not the student decides to subscribe to
additional services such as Internet or
outgoing phone calls.
"The phones should act as IC inter-
nal telephones, ie. Phone calls between
the new Ericsson phones, and to other
university phones should be free.
"Students should be free to cancel
their agreement with
Ericsson at any time,
they should not be
committed to a year/
term's worth at a time.
'Ericsson billing
should be entirely
independent from
accommodation
billing.
Ericsson are quite
open about the fact
that they are only in
this to make as much
money as they can. Having already stated
their intentions to expand their services
lo IC's other sites, even to students in pri-
vate accommodation and alumni wher-
ever in the world they might be! This
puts both college and us, the students in
a very good position in negotiations.
Don't be an apathetic lemming: "Make
your self heard". The student represen-
tative in discussions with Ericsson is Chris

Lights Out
Kevin has noticed yet another example
of technics going wrong in IC. This time
trying merely to accomplish the simple
procedure of turning the board lights
on in a Lecture Theatre. Faced with a
lectern adorned with more buttons than
your average scientific calculator, the
lecturer was out of her depth. She
decided to attempt to explain the reason
for the flickering lights to the students:
"It's taking about thirty seconds for the
information to get from the switch to the
lights. Which of course means when I
turn them on, by the time they come on,
I've turned them off again."

Presidential Talk-Back
T
omorrow AUT members are going
on strike. The NUS have already
given the action their full backing,
but as a President w h o has to deal
with real issues and not just give sound
bites against them I would advise stu-
dents not to boycott exams. Although
some may interpret this message as
one of opposition to the strike, my
advice to all students was to pay
their tuition fees, despite how much
I disagreed with them.
This Friday is the Annual General
Meeting at 1pm in the Union Din-
ning Hall; it is the most important
meeting in the Union calendar. For
the meeting to be quorate (to have
the number of people required to
make the meeting legitimate) we
need to have 200 students attend-
ing, so please c o m e along a n d
bring your department with you.
The Annual General Meeting is
your one opportunity in the year to
question any of the officers on what
they have d o n e throughout the
course of the year. The Union will
present its Annual Report, outlining
what the Union has achieved in the
year and review what services it
offers its members. The Officers of
the Union for next year will then be
voted in, every student there gets a
vote. These officers have their own
areas of specialisation, but all
receive a vote in the Union Council,
the sovereign body of the Union, in
which all major decisions and poli-
Davld Hellard, ICU President
cies of the Union are made. If you
want to stand for any of the positions,
all you need to do is sign up on the
notice board outside of the Union
Office, with a seconder and ten pro-
posers.
In celebration of this great event
Anderson Consulting are holding the
Pit Stop Challenge, in which you can
play on a giant skelectrics set, change
the wheels of a formula one car and
take advantage of the all day bar. If
the Annual General Meeting is Quo-
rate, I might even buy one lucky par-
ticipant a free pint.
