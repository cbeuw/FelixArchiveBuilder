To Strike or Not to Strike?
You are not at school, and lecturers are
not simply teachers. Benefiting from uni-
versity education requires having a good
working relationship between students
and academic staff, and that means that
both groups should show some interest
in the other's problems.
Patronising comment aside, what I
am trying to say is that you can't ignore
the AUT strike. Listen to the arguments
and opinions, and make up your own
mind. If you decide that the AUT's action
is justified, at least in principle, then you
are faced with a problem; what should
you do tomorrow?
What follows is NOT official advice,
nor Felix editorial policy, merely my own
view. If you do not have exams tomor-
row, do not come in to college.
Lectures can be caught up, and probably
won't happen anyway, and you can sur-
vive without the library for a day. Skip that
lab project and watch the cricket instead.
If you do have exams, it's probably
a good idea to turn up - college may well
fail students who do not turn up, and nei-
ther the AUT nor ICU may be able to fight
such a ruling. Having said that, if you
know most of the people taking the
exam, get together before hand and
decide to skip it as a group. It will be dif-
ficult to validate an exam if only 1 0 % of
the students turn up and, besides, col-
lege can't afford to have that many fails
in a year - it might lose us our second
place in the league tables.
If all that sounds too militant for you,
then why not add a small paragraph of
protest to the end of your exam answer
paper? Write a brief note to the examiner
explaining how you had to cross AUT
picket lines to take the exam, and how
you feel it is wrong for college to go
ahead with exams on a strike day. Per-
haps suggest that Colleges listen to their
staff's demands and respect industrial
action.
Such a note will either be read by a
non-striking member of London Univer-
sity, in which case it will remind them of
the action being taken, or will otherwise
eventually end up in the hands of an AUT
member, which will demonstrate your
support. If you are not prepared to risk
your degree then at least show you
appreciate the issues.
The Union will be open as usual, so
if you do come into college and then
decide not to pursue academic work for
the day, you can always relax in the bar
over lunch.
As for me? I will be around for most
of the day (after all, someone has to
actually cover the strike!), but I am unlikely
to answer enquiries and suchlike from
College - not that it'll matter, as no one
from the other side of Prince Consort
Road ever phones me anyway.
Again, these are personal views -
decide what to do for yourself. - Ed
