Right Angles to the Rising Sun
The Mosquitoes and Pineapples of Okinawa
M
e n s o r e uchina! as the locals
say, or as anyone born south
of the Watford Gap would
have it - "Welcome to Okinawa". O h
good grief, I hear you cry, where the
hell is he this week? Pray let m e
explain. Every year at the beginning of
May, a series of conveniently-placed
public holidays gives rise to the phe-
n o m e n o n of G o l d e n W e e k during
which the worker bees of corporate
Japan down tools and d e c a m p en
masse for sunnier climes for a well-
earned spell of R&R. This little drone
being no exception, I decided to take
this opportunity to head off to Japan's
most southerly province to escape
from the constant shuttlecock and bat-
tledore of life on the mainland. I must
admit to having an ulterior motive - my
girlfriend (it might surprise you to learn
that even I have one) comes from
Nago in northern Okinawa, and as
such I could kill two birds with one
stone and see her and have a holiday
on the cheap at the same time.
Okinawa - in reality a collection of
several little islands which takes its
name from the largest of the group -
is the smallest, and some would say
most spectacular, of the jewels in
Japan's geographical
crown. Its southerly
location - closer to
Taiwan than Tokyo - b e n O t C - H O U S t h r O U g h -
ensuresthat it is also
the warmest and O U t t h e h u m a n W O r l d
this fact is reflected

are now no longer for-
eigners in their own country, there
was another difficulty associated with

in the distinctive
nature of its flora
and fauna. The
main island is only a
shade over 60 miles
from end to e n d ,
and is divided in
almost equal part
between a grey, forbidding US military
base and lush, mountainous forest
inhabited by centipedes the size of
cats. Actually that's a bit of an exag-
geration - the Marines life is not quite
as extensive as all that and the creepy-
crawlies are really only as big as a
large kitten at most. However, there
is no escaping the American military
presence, a legacy of WWII when Oki-
nawa was the only part of Japan
invaded by the Allied forces prior to
the post-1945 US occupation of the
mainland. In fact, up until its return to
Japan in 1972, Okinawa was under the
government of the States, and the
locals actually needed passports to go
to the mainland (and you thought hav-

failed to notice
that in direct con-
travention of all
known conven-
tions of decency
and c o m m o n
sense, the Ameri-
cans will insist on
driving their cars
on the right hand
side of the road.
By contrast the
Japanese, in c o m m o n with the rest of
the civilised world drive on the left,
and thus when Okinawa - until then
the de facto 51st state of the Union -
returned to the fold, the local popula-
tion in the inimitable words of Charl-
ton Heston "had themselves a
situation". But in a gargantuan feat of
organisation, only outdone by the
efforts of the Apollo programme, the
entire population of the island
switched from dri-
ving on the right to
driving on the left
overnight. Any-
where else such a
dramatic realign-
ment would have
been unthinkable,
but in Japan cooper-
u n p a l a t a b l e , b u t t h e ative activity on this
scale passes off
i n s e c t k i n g d o m c l e a r l y without a hitch. In
fact I sometimes get

would be easier to
get the entire population of 125 mil-
lion to pick a single set of Lottery num-
bers than it would to get two
Westerners to agree on which pub to
go to on Friday night.
But there's a lot more to the place
than Gl Joe and astounding feats of
consensual motoring. There's insects
for a start. Lots of them. Mosquitoes
in particular. There was I, being
wowed by fabulous scenery, getting
my ears back on local delicacies in
charming little roadside restaurants or
marvelling at seas so clear and blue
that they looked like a kindergarten
kid's painting of "what I did on my
holidays", and all the time I was slap-
ping at swarms of the little perishers

Matt Salter until I sounded like the
rhythm track off a Snoop
Doggy Dog song. They didn't seem to
bother the locals who wandered about
totally unmolested, but as soon as I set
foot outside the car a cloud of winged
syringes m a d e a
beeline (or should
that be a mos-
quito-line) for my
pasty white flesh
like something out
of "633 Squadron".
M a y b e they saw
me as a chance to
get a bit of variety
in their diet I don't
know, but what-
ever the reason
they were impossible to ignore. British
food might be notorious throughout
the human world for being bland and
unpalatable, but the insect kingdom
clearly begs to differ.
This profusion of (sometimes
unwelcome) wildlife comes about as a
direct result of Okinawa being situ-
ated in the sub-tropics and, whilst this
can lead to occasional bouts of tem-
porary anaemia, it also makes for
scenery which is
really something to
behold. Driving
around the coastal
roads (on the left of
course) I was struck
by the sheer variety
and lushness of the
greenery that seems
to overwhelm every
spare patch of coun-
tryside. It wasn't just
that there was a
heck of a lot of it
that surprised me, it
was that pretty much all of it were
totally new to me. There were spiky
plants and twisty plants, plants with
huge, broad leaves that looked like
they had grown upside-down, and
trees that resembled 30-foot tall broc-
coli florets covered with thick creepers
that would have had Tarzan of the
Apes nodding with approval. It was a
bit like being on the set of Jurassic
Park. At one point, looking out over
the wide expanses of verdant forest
from my vantage point of a mountain-
top cafe that was accessible only via
long winding roads the width of a
human hair, I was struck anew by the
unbelievable density and variety of
the vegetation which, I felt sure, must
conceal an army of majorly gigantic

spiders.
Its not just the inedible foliage
that is different over there. O n
another occasion, whilst driving across
country I asked my girlfriend - who
had bravely opted for what my father
used to call the "suicide seat" - what all
the odd-looking bushes growing in
the fields were. "Pineapples" she
replied, faintly irritated that anyone
could ask such a stupid question. I
think the next field contained a crop
of mangos, but I wasn't about to open
my mouth and run the risk of looking
even more of a berk. What goes for
the fruit goes double for the fish and
seafood. O n e afternoon we went to
a friend's house for a barbecue the
star attraction at which, apart from
heroic quantities of succulent Pacific
crab, was a bewildering array of trop-
ical fish caught fresh off the reef that
very morning. They weren't your usual
cod, haddock and skate, these wete
pukka "Jacques Cousteau's Amazing
World of the Deep" fish complete with
peculiar fins and long wispy feelers,
and colours so bright and vibrant that
they looked for all the world like they
had been caught up in an explosion in
a paint factory. Some of the less lurid
amongst their num-
ber were wrapped in
foil and slapped
straight on the grill
whilst the rest were
cut up there and
then, marinated per-
functorily in soy
sauce and lemon
juice, and eaten raw
washed down with
large glasses of the
local brew which, as
far as I could make
out, consists of 2
parts lighter fuel to 1 part pink paraf-
fin diluted with mineral water. I now
know what really fresh fish tastes like
and it ain't Harry Ramsden's.
During our al fresco feast one of
our party proudly informed me that
Okinawa boasts the largest number
of centigenarians per head in the
whole of Japan and after what I'd
seen, smelled and tasted in my all too
brief visit I would have though that 100
years was probably too short a time to
spend in this place. I've already
b o o k e d my next trip when I
shall come armed with twice as many
rolls of film as this time, my swim-
ming trunks and a fishing rod. And an
industrially-sized tube of mosquito
repellent.
