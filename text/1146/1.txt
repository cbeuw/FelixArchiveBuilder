Imperial Staff Will Strike Tomorrow
Members of the Association of Uni-
versity Teachers (AUT), which includes
the majority of Imperial's academic
staff, are to strike tomorrow, Tuesday
25 May. The strike is likely to effect lec-
tures and examinations, as well as dis-
rupting other services throughout
college. The strike, which is the result
of an ongoing pay dispute, will only
affect the South Kensington campus,
as clinical staff have received a differ-
ent pay settlement to other acade-
mics.
As Felix went to press, the scale of
the strike's effects was unknown. It is
possible that some or all of tomor-
row's examinations will go ahead, with
the college finding alternative exam-
iners. Alternatively, the day's acade-
mic work could be rescheduled for

later this term. Ms Laura Barker, IC's
AUT president, hoped "that the stu-
dents do not come in that day", as a
sign of support for the strikers, adding
that she "will stand behind students
who skip exams", suggesting the col-
lege could successfully reschedule
them. David Hellard, ICU President,
was more wary, suggesting that if stu-
dents had exams or other essential
work to do, then they should come in
to college. O n a more conciliatory note
he added "if you don't need to come
in, I wouldn't bother, as a sign of com-
radeship". Students will not be pre-
vented from entering the campus and,
although it is likely that there will be
picket lines, Ms Barker assured Felix
that strikers would merely "seek to per-
suade peacefully".
The strike action has the support of
the National Union of Students (NUS),
as well as other unions representing
university staff. In a letter dated 10
May from NUS President Andrew
Pakes, to the AUT, he described the
3.5% salary increase that had been
offered to AUT members as "a derisory
pay offer". The letter continued; "I have
every faith in you and your union that
you will do your utmost to minimise
the impact of this action on students
at exam time." Ms Barker agreed,
emphasising "students aren't our tar-
get". She went on to explain plans for
the pay deducted from striking staff to
be given to student hardship funds at
Imperial, an action which could be
seen as an attempt at compensation
for the disruption.
It is unlikely that the strike on its
own will achieve the AUT's objectives.
Ms Barker agreed, describing it as "a
demonstrative action - the start of a
process". That "process" is likely to
involve a four day boycott of exami-
nation administration in June, which
could further disrupt students' exams,
and action during the hectic recruit-
ment period in late summer.

London Student Blows Up a Storm
London Student, the newspaper serving
the students of the University of Lon-
don, was threatened with legal action
as a result of an article published in
their issue of April 30. Professor Zellick,
the Vice Chancellor of the University of
London, allegedly threatened to sue
London Student and its editor, as well
as the University of London Union, in
response to the article, entitled "Mad
Prof Demands Barmy ULU Ballots".
The article in question reported that
he had caused some disturbance in
union circles with his judgement that
the recently held ULU elections "didn't
comply" with the Education Act. Pro-
fessor Zellick ruled that all future elec-
tions to ULU posts had to be done with
a cross-campus ballot. This was widely
criticised as being impractical, too
expensive (estimated cost Â£60,000) and
logistically horrendous, since over
100,000 students would need to be
polled.
According to one source the cur-
rent ULU president and publisher of
London Student, Matt Hyde, was pres-
sured by Professor Zellick to withdraw
that issue of London Student. Mr Hyde
By Mansoor Choudhury
wrote a letter to London Student, pub-
lished in May 14 issue, criticising the
article as being "somewhat misleading"
in its criticism of Professor Zellick since
he had not been Vice Chancellor when
the Education Act was drafted, when an
exemption from cross-campus ballots
for ULU should have been obtained.
Dave Hellard ICU President com-
mented, "If... Matt was trying to get it
censored, it was pressure from above".
He also added that he believed in the
freedom of the press and concurred
with what had been stated in the Lon-
don Student article.
Matt Hyde dimissed allegations
that he tried to stop the release of the
issue in question as "unsubstantiated
rumours"; Professor Zellick was unavail-
able for comment.
