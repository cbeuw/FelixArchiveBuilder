I
ndie-thriller... dark and broody...
twisty-turny plot... trying to escape
small-town America... murder...
decent cast of young, sexy, next-big-
thing types... intricate plan goes wrong...
Sound familiar?
Eventually all these movies begin to
blur into one - one big, unpleasant vision
of a crime filled world, where everything
turns out for the best, yet everyone gets
hurt. In this case, that image is imposed
onto Nivola and Witherspoon, as the
boyfriend/girlfriend duo who come up
with an incredibly contrived plan to raise
the money which will pay off Nivola's
debts to a local gangster. Having per-
suaded Witherspoon (who, worryingly,
looks 17 despite being 23) to seduce
Brolin in order to rob his house, the plan
goes pear-shaped when Brolin goes men-
tal and locks her up in the basement.
Cue much swearing, anguish and, of
course, blind panic.
Generic it may be, but thanks to a
constantly swirling plot and appealing act-
ing from the leads, it's an engaging tale.
Sadly the ending fails to surprise, despite
trying hard to confound your expecta-
tions, yet the plot as a whole is far enough
America, where all the streets are paved with gold..
removed from anything else you'll have
seen to keep you engrossed from start to
finish - despite being an essentially moral-
ity-free zone. Moreover, the movie's suc-
cess in the US will undoubtedly pave the
way to future stardom for the leads - par-
ticularly Witherspoon, who, with three
more movies due this year, has been
picked out as one of the faces of 1999.
Sacrificing genuine originality and
depth for style and appeal, Best Laid Plans
is nonetheless a decent and entertaining
- albeit downbeat - movie. D

The waterboy
This surprise US box office hit comedy
features Adam Sandler playing Bobby
Boucher, a lowly water boy for his
local university football team.
Although he's a bit 'slow', BB thinks
that the dispensing of the halftime
water is the greatest thing he's ever
done. However, a series of blunders
costs him his job and so the scene is
set for BB to take his local town by
storm.
Not content with being a Holly-
wood star, Sandler is also a recording
artist in his own right and has sold
well over 31.5 million albums. He also
understands how important a sound-
track is to a film and The Watcrboy
soundtrack is no different, featuring a
remarkable mix of rock classics by ELO,
John Mellencamp, Lenny Kravitz, Rush
and the Doors with more contempo-
rary artists such as Goldfinger, Can-
dlebox and The Candyskins. The CD is
out now.
Blast From
The Past
Eclectic or eccentric would be the nice
way to describe this one; uninspired
would be the less kind way. Mixing
REM, Randy Newman, Perry Como and
US 'Alternative' bands (with such 'hilar-
ious' names as Squirrel Nut Zippers,
Cherry Poppin' Dadies and Dishwalla).
Somehow, it ultimately blends
together surprisingly well (in a cheesy,
happy kinda way) but nonetheless it's
definitely not the kind of thing you're
likely to want to buy.
At First Sight
Composer Mark Isham is best known
for writing jazzy scores and for his
proficiency on the jazz trumpet, and
consequently it's hardly surprising that
he stirs a lot of jazzy piano-tinkling
into the unashamedly soppy score for
this Val Kilmer/Mira Sorvino starrer.
Drifting between gentle musing
and haunting restraint, it's designed to
accompany a candlelit dinner, rather
than a lengthy Quake session, and
mixes seven original songs with some
classic Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Arm-
strong. Pleasant enough if you like
that kind of thing...
