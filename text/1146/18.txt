Summary:
Creatures of the night, fight!
What's it all about:
Beat-em-up arcade g;
from the Capcom neo-
family. Naughty old Jed
In theDarkWorld-asm,
side Chelmsford, has fc
urrected and with not
Saturday night. Fancyin
of a fighter he's sumn
owners of Valuable soul
unite under one rule -
lowing one too many
arguement over who w;
of Rod, Jane and Fredc
has been blown out of
Good Graphics:
Arcade quality cartoon graphics - though
I'm saying Neo geo southside arcade
quality not Namco World. Sure they move
like they are meant to but there is very
little here that is new or special.
Seraphim Sounds:
Like a Neo-geo unit. Come back in five
years and it might be retro but it Just
sounds very dated.
Great Gameplay:
Better than the average 2D beat-em-up.
There is the usual combination attacks,
auto defence for beginners, even secret
moves you can find out how to do on
web sites throughout the world.
But this is the
whole problem.
The 2D beat-em-up
is stuck in a bit of a
rut. We've had car-
toons, motion cap-
ture and even
model animation
beat-em-ups but
there is very little
new here. The ana-
logue controller
might rumble and
the one player
game contains the
feature where the character gains expe-
rience and new moves after every battle,
but it belongs in the same bin pac-man
and space invaders -
till someone sorts out
a better way of con-
trolling the player
other than pressing
keys this type of
game is not going to
make a big come
back. The future
might just be VR con-
trollers - eventually.
Sex and Violence:
As most of the char-
acters are either dead
or undead we will pass straight over the
necrophilia jokes on stiffs. The violence
aspect - well it is a fighting game after all.
Violence and fighting, hmm there could
actually be a link here. Though in true
Capcom style the only thing on the floor
will be tears when you get beat ten times
in a row. Blood is definately not an
option.
Who Will buy It:
Darkstalkers 2 players, fans of manga
cartoons wanting a beat-em-up. Buffy
the Vampire slayer watchers buying
purely based on the large breasted
woman on the front cover holding the
skull is really dark.
