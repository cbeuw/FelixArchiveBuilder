Tank Racer (PC) Lego Chess (PC)
Grolier Interactive Lego Multimedia
I once drove a tank. No wait, it's true -
a day out from school took us to some
god-forsaken wilderness where we were
let loose with various forms of lethal
hardware,
one of
which was
this bloody
great tank.
I didn't
drive it for
long
though -
for some
reason
they
seemed to
feel that
letting
someone
with my psychological problems loose
with 10 tons of armour and enough fire-
power to level a small Wiltshire village
wasn't too hot an idea. Anyway, as a
result of this considerable experience in
the field, I can exclusively reveal to you
here in Felix that tanks are not designed
to be raced. They lack acceleration and
cornering ability. The Italian Job would
have been a very different film had the
makers used tanks rather than minis.
Remember - you read it here first.
Now, given its name, there may be
some of you who have jumped to the
conclusion that Tank Racer is a game
which involves racing tanks. And you'd
be absolutely right. Think Mariokart64
with tanks and without the irritating Nin-
tendo-stylee cuddly animals, and you
have a pretty good idea of what lies
within this game. You have a variety of
tanks (which could never
be confused with real
tanks, oh no) to drive
each with slightly differ-
ent characteristics, you
have a variety of courses
some of which could be
confused with a small
Wiltshire village) over
which to discover what
those differences are, you
have things to run over
(cows, signs, dustbins and
- ' - ' s o on) and you have a
variety of power-ups with which to shoot
your fellow Tank Racees. And that's
about it.
Except that it's fun. Lots of fun.
Even the sin-
gleplayer
game (usu-
ally the big
let down in
games of this
sort) is fun.
Tank Racer
I doesn't pre-
tend to be
pushing back
the bound-
aries of PC
gaming in
any way, just
does exactly
what it says on the tin. And in the
process has become the best arcade
racing game on the PC since MicroMa-
chines.

Back in the old old days ol
hai id
blocks or red, while, blue and
if you were roali
Ihen came along space lego -
with fancy rocket shaped bits, Â» -
and technical lego - wilh Ihe
big
that was not enough I
denly themed everything -
medieval lego, pirate lego,
cowboy lego, there is even
now a Star Wars Phantom menace lego
set of kits (early large birthday present
hint). Lego are taking over the brick
world.
Not happy with just occupying the
physical world Lego Multimedia are try-
ing to take over
the virtual gaming
world. This time
the bricks are
muscling in on the
ancient game of
chess, and
attempting to
make it fun for
more than the
swot at the back of
the class.
Please don't
make me have to
explain chess. You might not have played
it for a while but surely you remember
the eight by eight grid and the little
pieces you still might call prawns and
horses and castles. Though continuing to
call them prawns will usually earn you a
smack on the back of the head from your
opponent any time after the fourth
move. Try it if you dont believe me.

Ok so this is chess in lego form. In
order to get the kids interested and tie
in the lego aspect the pieces can either
come from the cowboy or pirate range
of lego. So in the cowboy game the
pawns are Indian braves, the rooks artil-
iary men.
These all
march,
and run
across
the 3D
board as
the laws
of lego
allow
(there is
a 2D nor-
mal view
game for the purists, but if you are one
of those purists then this game is not
really for you). Each time you take a
piece there is also a cute and bloodless
cut scene - well it is lego. Some of them
even had this old hack smiling - well
some of them were straight out of the
old Road Runner scripts.
Well ok perhaps you have guessed
its not really been designed for
the University student in mind
- more the 6 year old set, so
the level of the game is hard
rather than Deep blue level.
But this aside it is just so very
cute you can't completely
ignore it. The sort of game
your gran and grandad could
play, not like that nasty vicious
kingpin game...oooohhh all
that swarelng.

Competition Corner
Age of Empires and Expansion Pack answer and winner
Oh please boys and girls, what do they teach you guys in school ?
The answer to the question : What clothing Innovation are the celts usually associated with are the trousers.
(The kilt is just a little bit too much like a skirt to be an innovation really.)
So the winner is Suwa Du Fung
He can pick up the prize from the office any lunch time this week.
