14 Clubscene 24 May 1999
St. Matthew's Church, Brixton. £10/£12, 10pm - bam
monthly Fridays. Capacity - 1,000. Dress code - none.
You'd expect this night to be a bit of a corker seeing
fas how one of the members of the seminal band Leftlield
f has a hand in it. However, seminal is not how I'd describe!
Ihis night. If you've been a regular reader of Clubscene
; then you will know what a great venue Mass is, and h o w |
nights such as Nymph use it to its full potential. The Shift-i
l i n g Gears people have something to learn from them, If
p e l .
Half empty venues, monotonous, non-descript house, |
|and seemingly pissed off punters does not really make for
.the ideal night o n the tiles. Also, the backroom w a s |
|devoted to some sort of perverted cross between dance!
imusic and the early 80s music. This is a worrying trend,
fwhich must be stopped dead in Its tracks. Disco house may|
| be a welcome addition to the increasingly wide genre o f |
| dance music, but any association with that most unfash-
i o n a b l e of decades can only be harmful to a scene, which |
is, after all partly driven by fashion.
But I'm not going to be totally harsh on the Shifting!
jGears people. There was potential there, and their sub
jsequent move to the glorious Scala club, may help diem
| t o really take off. I just hope they bin the 80s fixation o n |
the way.
First gear all the way |
Carwash's I Oth Birth-
day @ London Astoria
10pm - 4 am, £15, Saturday 1st May, capacity - 2,000. Dress code - very very
glam.
You'll have seen our review of this extra-glam disco/funk night a few months
ago. And you know what we thought of it here at Clubscene. Absolutely fan-
tastic - the only place to be seen strutting your stuff whilst donning your (or
your parents) finest 70s attire. So it'll come as no surprise that when we were
asked along to their 10th b'day party we had another stunning night.
It had all the best aspects of any Carwash Saturday night, but it was, of
course, very much bigger, and personally, that little bit better. But, of course,
you'd expect that on anyone's b'day, now wouldn't you? It appears that size
does matter after all.
The London Astoria is an old converted theatre, and this is still reflected
in the layout of the club. It is very much like The Fridge in Brixton, with a huge
balcony-style upstairs area looking down on the huge dancefloor, and the gigan-
tic stage. Plenty of room to pose above the rest of the crowd - as everyone
likes to do on these type of occasions. And, after all that's what Carwash is all
about. Being as extrovert (in a 70s kind of way, of course) as you want to be
and just letting it all hang loose for the night.
A great night for all you Saturday Night fever freaks out there, which con-
tinues every Saturday at its usual London Astoria 2 venue. Go along and make
Tony Moreno (aka John Travolta) proud with your funky moves.
