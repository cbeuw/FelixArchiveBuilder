What would Legalisation Lead to?
Attitudes towards drugs are as diverse as the people who hold them. In the first of a two part feature, Felix examines the
attitudes and arguments for and against the legalisation of drugs. This week Andrew Vivian explains his view that cannabis
should be used for medical applications under strict regulation, whilst remaining commercially illegal.
Following the respectable comments proposed by
Mr 'Anonymous' (coward) last term and in the after-
math of the recent pro-legalisation march I feel
that it is time to present arguments against the legal-
isation of cannabis.
May I first utterly refute the claim made by
Howard Marks published in last week's article that
two thirds of all under 25s take cannabis. Perhaps
he assumed that the statistics of his
friends and colleagues were
applicable to the British youth as a
whole...
As I see it the main problem
with legalising cannabis is that it
would unequivocally lead to an
increase in all drug usage. Com-
mercial marketing through wide-
spread advertising would increase
the awareness and availability of all
drugs (not just cannabis) to the
entire populace. Attracted to the
relative safety of cannabis new smokers would
arise, most of w h o m would no doubt enjoy the
experience; s o m e of these new arrivals would
branch out into other forms of drug use in search
of different inducible experiences. Kids w h o get a
kick out of breaking rules or through trying to
impress others will use harder drugs if cannabis is
legalised and loses its coolness or even 'hard' sym-
bolism (lets be honest, - this is how some of you
started smoking in the first place).
Sure, some kids are already on hard
drugs but numbers would
rise. The last two points
are basically the results
of different forms of
peer pressure. A tiny
minority may crave
new challenges
and even hold that
if the government
relents o n
^ cannabis then
they can get away with more
moderate crimes (I'm not sug-
gesting anyone at IC would
be stupid e n o u g h to think
that though!); imagine if the
government were actually to
give in - a whole new gen-
eration of protesters would
\ emerge pressing for slack-
\ ness on other issues -
just how far would this
"Commercial market
ing through wide-
spread advertising
would increase the
awareness and avail
ability of all drugs..."
"Keep cannabis
commercially
illegal, although
exploit any
medicinal benefit
it may have..."
go? (c.f. suing actions in the USA)
tet us consider the scenario where drug usage
increased but knock on effects
were themselves insignificant.
What grounds are there for
o p p o s i n g increased drug
usage - surely it is the individ-
ual's choice if they partake?
Well, actually
that's not the
case. You're
forgetting the
non-smokers.
The users are content but the non-
users lose, subject to the behav-
iour, influence and smoke released
by the smokers. Some of you may
recall the letter I submitted last
term requesting at least a
small area of the
union to be
designated non-smoking. My
thanks to the Union officials
w h o didn't even bother to
reply.... bastards. Our Union is
a classic example of non-smok-
ers being subjected to the whim
of those who smoke. Legalising
cannabis and increasing drug avail-
ability will increase the already high
number of such sit-
uations, - not good for
the non-smoker who quite
rightfully wants to have a
social life without unnecessary
health hazards. Not only that, but
drug usage isn't exactly aestheti-
cally pleasing. While being boxed
in behind a smoker around Ihc
pavements of Piccadilly with no
way of avoiding the smoke 'catch-
ment area' may drive me positively
livid, the sight of cigarette butts
everywhere is horrible, especially in areas of oth-
erwise natural or indeed artificial beauty. These cir-
cumstances should be actively reduced and not
encouraged by promoting further drug use through
cannabis legalisation.
You may argue on this account thai I would
have to concede that tobacco and alcohol should
also be illegal. Well In the case of tobacco I agree
whole-heartedly, as for alcohol it is less rational
(and I'm not saying that in bias -1 hate the taste of
alcohol and very rarely drink) even though it has its
"...ask yourself why the
legality of a drug should
actually bother you if you
can easily get hold of that
drug anyway?"
fair share of related damage to innocent citizens
(drink-driving). The issue is that the consequences
of cannabis can be foreseen
whereas for tobacco they were
not (and in the ignorant 60s
tobacco was even regarded as
good for your health).
Solutions? Keep cannabis
commercially illegal, although
exploit any medicinal benefit it
may have in controlled medical
establishments. Quite frankly
though, I would be happy for
you to smoke whatever the hell you want in your
homes if you consented to never doing so in
public - and then strictly adhered to such
*w a compensation.
You may still completely disagree with
what I have said, but then ask yourself why
the legality of a drug should actually bother
you if you can easily get hold of that drug
' anyway? Cannabis is not high on
the police's a g e n d a as the blatant
usage during the pro-legalisation
march proved, and I can only think
lhat if any of you are still for legali-
sation then you must cither be self-
ish or have business propositions...

Next week Danny Kushlick, spokesman for Transform, a pressure group who believes that current British
drug laws should be re-examined, presents arguments for the legalisation of most, if not all, drugs.
