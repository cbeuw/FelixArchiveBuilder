Journalist's Rights Violated
BY LYNN BRAVEY
A former Felix Editor is to have his
case heard in the European Court of
Human Rights after he was fined
£5,000 for refusing to reveal his
sources.
B i l l Goodwin (27) was Felix
Editor in the academic year 1988-
89. He went to work as a trainee
reporter for The Engineer where he
received confidential financial
information about Tetra L t d , a
computer company. He was told
over the phone by an informant that
the company was in financial
trouble and was urgently seeking a
large loan.
Mr Goodwin contacted a senior
executive of Tetra Ltd about the
information. The company then
obtained an injunction preventing
publication of the story. It claimed
that the information had been stolen
from its offices and might be passed
on to customers or competitors,
threatening the jobs of 400 employ-
ees and the company's survival.
Tetra Ltd wanted to take action
against the informant but were
unable to as Mr Goodwin refused to
reveal the person's identity, even
when the High Court ordered him to
in November 1989. Mr Goodwin
was later fined £5,000 for contempt
of court, which he felt was a breach
of his freedom of expression. At the
time, he told Felix that, although he
had faced a possible 12 year jail
sentence, he had not been impris-
oned "because of the publicity". His
case was later thrown out of the
court of appeal and discarded by the
House of Lords without a hearing.
However, it was revealed last
Wednesday that The European
Commission of Human Rights is to
refer the case to the European Court
of Human Rights after ruling that
the British Government violated the
reporter's rights. If the court agrees
with this ruling, Britain will be
forced to provide stronger protection
for journalists under the 1981
Contempt of Court Act.
In a ruling that the Government
had violated article 10 of the
Convention of Human Rights the
Commission said: "[We] consider
that the protection of the sources
from which journalists derive infor-
mation is an essential means of
enabling the press to perform its
important function of 'public
watchdog' in a democratic society."
The Commission felt that, as the
matter was not one affecting national
security, there was no justification
in ordering Mr Goodwin to identify
his source. They also decided that
the company's claim that 400 jobs
would be lost as a result of the
information being made public was
unsubstantiated and that it had not
suffered any of the harm predicted.
Geoffrey Robertson, QC for Mr
Goodwin said: "This decision is
important because it is the first time...
[the Commission] has accepted that
the right to freedom of expression
must extend to protect people who
disclose newsworthy information to
journalists. Our contempt law fails to
give journalists the protection they
need to tell the public the truth."
Mr Goodwin told Felix that he is
hoping for a favourable ruling,
saying: "As part of a settlement, I
would ask the Government to
change the law...Britain is very
backward [in contempt law] com-
pared to other European countries."
Imperial Enters The Big League
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Imperial College is once more in
the top three in The Times
University League tables.
This is the second year that The
Times has published tables ranking
all British Universities. It has also
printed the criteria on which the
league table was based.
Although Imperial College has
come third in the overall league, it
has been placed at the top of four of
these criteria tables. Imperial
College held the pole position in
Government supported research,
staff with PhDs, contract research
and the number of students attaining
first class honours.
In an interview with Felix Dr
Rodney Eastwood, Deputy
Managing Director of Imperial
College, questioned the reliability
of the tables saying that although
they are "good publicity", the
College could not "put a lot of cre-
dence on it".
The league was not all good
news. The College came a poor
37th in the student accommodation
league, with only 40% of students
living in accommodation provided
by College. Institutions rating high
in this category offer housing for
over 70% of their students.
Imperial College also fared
badly on drop out rates (40th, with
10% of students not completing
their degrees) and graduate employ-
ment (59th, with 13% of graduates
still unemployed six months after
graduation).
Teaching Awards
BY MIKE INGRAM
Imperial College is to present new
Teaching Awards to staff at the
Commemoration Day in October.
The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, has initiated the setting up
of a scheme to raise the profile of
teaching within the College. A
provisional plan for the awards has
been developed by the Pro-Rector,
John Archer, and discussed by the
Board of Undergraduate Studies.
The staff/student committees and
heads of each department will
choose the recipient of their
'Excellence in Teaching' award on
the grounds of who has made the
most outstanding contribution to
undergraduate teaching in the
department.
The names of winners, along
with supporting citations, will be
submitted to an adjudicating
committee (including student repre-
sentatives) who will choose the
recipients of the 'Teaching Fellow
of 1994' awards in science, engi-
neering and medicine. These
awards, including cash prizes of
£1000, will be presented at the
Commemoration Day ceremony in
October.
Soup Run
In Peril
BY LYNN BRAVEY
The future of the Soup Run is in
doubt due to a lack of minibus
drivers.
The Soup Run is organised by
the Imperial College Community
Action Group (ICCAG) and offers
food to London's homeless.
Despite placing adverts in Felix
requesting more volunteer drivers,
none have come forward.
The current minibus driver leaves
at the end of this term, leaving the
volunteers without transport. They
need people over 21 with a current
driving licence who are willing to
take the Imperial College Union
minibus driver test.
I C C A G operate the Soup Run
every Thursday evening, leaving
Weeks Hall at 9pm.
