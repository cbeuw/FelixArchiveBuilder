Royal Visits to Imperial College
Computing student Rafal Lukawiecki discusses his work with Princess Anne
BY PATRICK WOOD
The Princess Royal, Chancellor of
the University of London, opened
the Imperial College/Fujitsu
Parallel Computing Research
Centre in the Huxley Building on
Tuesday 24th May.
The Japanese electronics giant
Fujitsu, in its first such collabora-
tion with an academic institution,
has donated an AP1000 parallel
machine to the College. The
API 000, located in the Department
of Computing, is available to
research groups throughout Europe
via the SuperJANET network.
Access will be free to registered
users, who will share all software
developed on the machine. Areas of
research in which the API000 is
already being used include chaos,
virtual reality and artificial life
simulation. The new machine is
also available for use in relevant
undergraduate projects.
The Princess Royal was shown
the API000 in operation and then
unveiled a commemorative plaque
in the newly refurbished foyer of
the Huxley Building. Some have
criticised the £60,000 refurbishment
as a cosmetic exercise. Professor
John Darlington, Director of the
Centre, defended the decision. "It
was pretty dowdy...a depressing
place to enter," he said. "You've
got to refurbish the infrastructure
sooner or later and it does lift the
morale of people working here."
A second royal visit took place
two days later. Prince Andrew
attended one of the talks given in
the Huxley Building as part of the
seminar 'Is Life Becoming Hard?'.
The lectures dealt with topics
common to both the physical and
biological sciences, such as neural
networks. The seminar, jointly
sponsored by Imperial College and
S E M A Group pic, was one of the
events taking place to celebrate the
200th anniversary of the Ecole
Polytechnique in Paris.
Drop In University Funding
BY LYNN BRAVEY
University funding has been slashed
by 25% per student over the past
four years, according to a report
from the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals (CVCP).
The report, published on 20th
May, warned that standards of
teaching were bound to be affected
by this reduction in funding per
student. They also forecast that
funding will fall by a further 14%
over the next three years. The
authors feel that the resultant short-
fall, estimated at around £2 billion,
"has already impaired the quality of
the student experience because of
larger teaching groups...[and] less
spent on library books".
The C V C P want to enter into
discussions with the Government
about a new funding system able to
deliver both expansion and quality
in higher education. C V C P
Chairman, Dr Kenneth Edwards,
said: "To invest in universities is to
invest in the future...demand for
university education and research is
rising fast and will not abate. The
Government should recognise that
the universities are one of the U K ' s
success stories. How long will the
Government continue to risk the
quality which underlies that
success?"
In the past ten years, the pro-
portion of school-leavers going to
university has risen from one in
five to almost one in three, but
Government funding has not kept
up pace with this growth.
First Year
Student
Expelled
BY SIMON SHAW
A Physics student has been
expelled from Imperial College
after breaching the conditions
under which he was temporarily
suspended.
Ronnie Wong, a first year
Physics undergraduate, was sus-
pended from College for harassing
a female student {Felix 996). He
had anonymously sent the woman
messages by handwritten notes and
electronic mail for more than two
months before he was identified. A
College disciplinary hearing on
29th March suspended M r Wong
until the next academic year and
banned him from his victim's hall
of residence.
Just over a month later, M r
Wong was spotted in the woman's
hall of residence by three students
who alerted College Security. A
second College disciplinary hearing
was held on 16th May at which it
was decided to expel him. M r
Wong appealed to the Rector, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, but the decision
of the hearing was upheld.
College Security have put up
warning posters around College
bearing a photograph of Mr Wong.
If he is sighted in College,
Sherfield Security should be
notified directly on extension 3372.
