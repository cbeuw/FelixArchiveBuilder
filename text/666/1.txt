S TO TAKE STUDENT FLATS
The two student flats on the Southside Penthouse level are to be returned
to academic staff warden occupation after just five terms as student
residences. The decision is amongst a number of controversial moves
contained in a College notice on The Management of Student Residence
issued by College Secretary John Smith. The notice is the end result of
the Report on Student Residence at the College by Mr John Lauwerys
Senior Assistant Secretary, published in February last year.
Also in the notice is confirma- pastoral, social and disciplinary
tion that the College is to acquire
an additional 125 places in
College-owned residences. There
are a number of properties under
consideration, including some
additional houses in Evelyn
Gardens. These additional places
are necessary to keep the total
number of places over the target
of 2,000 with the loss of some
places in head tenancies.
The management of residences
is to get a shake-up as well, the
notice reveals. A new post of
Managing Surveyor (Residences)
will be created to take some of the
wardens' administrative and
domestic workload, for example
control of cleaning and mainten-
ance. M r Peter Hallworth,
presently a surveyor irl Estates,
has already been appointed to the
new post. This new post con-
forms largely with the recom-
mendations of the Lauwerys
report, and is designed to enable
wardens to 'concentrate on their
roles'.
The financing of residence is
also considered in the notice. It
seems that more effort is to be
made T
o separately identify costs
of residence and charge them to
the residence account. This in-
cludes the cost of security patrols
and services such as heating and
lighting. This is likely to result in
higher rents or less money being
spent on residences.
The power of the student
residence committee is also to be
reduced to that of an advisory
committee rather than a policy-
making one. This is generally
believed to be a way of reducing
the blocking power of wardens,
who have in the past t>een
successful in frustrating College
and Union plans for changes in
the running of the residences.
Two years ago the College
took a decision to reduce the
number of wardens in Southside
from four to two as an economy
measure, and to use the two
vacant wardens' flats for student
accommodation. This resulted in
each Southside warden being in
charge of two of the four 'halls'
which make up Southside. This
move was strongly opposed at the
time by the wardens themselves
and some Southside residents
whose warden was being re-
moved from the job. It is
common knowledge that the two
remaining Southside wardens,
Dr Paul Jowitt and D r Henry
Hutchinson, were opposed to
having students as neighbours on
the Penthouse level. This resulted
in a term's delay in getting
students in the vacant flats whilst
wrangling went on about the
conditions to be imposed on
residents.
The latest decision represents a
complete change of direction in
College policy and amounts to an
admission that John Smith now
believes the earlier decision to
reduce the number of wardens
was a mistake. The real reason for
Mr Smith's change of mind on
this issue may well be pressure
from Mews residents who com-
plain about lack of discipline in
Southside. The appointment of
another two wardens may well be
John Smith.
seen as a concession to them.
Although it has been decided
to put two extra wardens in
Southside it has apparently not
yet been decided which resi-
dences they will be in charge of. It
is possible that there will be a
reversion to the previous situa-
tion in Southside with four'halls'
each with its own warden. But
John Smith told F E L I X that
consideration would be given to
putting the new wardens resident
in Southside in charge of other
properties such as Evelyn Gdns,
Montpelier Street or unspecified
new residences which the College
is hoping to acquire. The most
likely of these new properties is
Cadogan Court, situated be-
t w e e n Q u e e n s g a t e a n d
Gloucester Road.

Q-What do Mike Stuart's head and the site of the missing
shield have in common? A-they're both bare!
No 666 I
Twenty-one of the twenty-two
shields stolen by a University
College mascotry team last
Thursday were returned to the
Guilds Union last Friday evening.
Guilds President, Mike Stuart
had issued an ultimatum to
University College Union that
unless the shields were returned
before 2:00pm on Friday he
would inform the police, as
reported in last week's F E L I X .
At 4:00pm on Friday the
Guilds Office received a call from
U C Union stating that 21 shields
FELIX, February 10, 1984 I ^ H H H H B H
had been recovered and could be
collected from the U C Security
Office. When they were collected
it was discovered that a number
of the shields were scratched and
slightly damaged. It is understood
that if the missing shield is not
recovered, U C Union will be
asked to pay for a replacement.
The hostage captured by IC
students, Adrian Head, a U C
student, was held overnight at IC.
He was finally released when the
21 shields were handed back.
