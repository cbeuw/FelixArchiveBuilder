The story so far
The system of higher education in
this country has largely evolved
hand-in-hand with the industrial
and economic expansion which
followed the last war. In 1963. the
influential Robbins Reports was
published, with the conclusion
that there should be open access
to Higher Education for all those
with two or more A-Level passes.
In order to cater for growing
popular demand, therefore, the
University system was subse-
quently expanded and. later, the
Polytechnics were developed.
This growth continued up until
the mid-1970s.
In 1980/1 Government cut-
backs in public expenditure
finally hit the Higher Education
sector with a venegence. Cuts in
the Universities averaging 15%
over the period 1981-4 were
announced. These cuts were
administered by the University
Grants Committee (UGC), who
were widely criticised at the time
for acting hastily and without
sufficient consultation when de-
ciding where the cuts were to fall.
The most obvious effects of the
U G C cuts were reductions in
student numbers and staffing
within the Universities, although
there is little doubt that teaching
and research have also suffered.
Despite cuts in the number of
students entering the Univer-
sities, the intake of students into
the Polytechnics increased, and
the last Conservative government
was able to say that, because the
proportion of eighteen-year-olds
taking degree courses had grown,
the 'Robbins principle' of open
access had not been breached.
Unfortunately, Polytechnic fund-
ing did not increase in line with
the expanded intake. This meant
that in many cases resources were
strained to such an extent that
students were being very much
'mass produced', consequently
receiving an inferior quality of
education.
The National Advisory Body
In 1981 the National Advisory
Body (NAB) was set up to advise
the Government on the distribu-
tion of funding for the Public
Sector of Higher Educaton. The
public sector consists of the
Polytechnics and Further Educa-
tion colleges, which are adminis-
tered and funded by Local
Education Authorities, and a
variety of 'special' colleges.
The N AB's short-term aim was
to advise on provision for the
public sector for 1984-5 in the

light of an overall 10% cut in
funding. Sir Keith Joseph, Secre-
tary of State for Education, has
recently accepted the N A B
recommendations, which will
mean the closure of several
institutions and courses and
initiate a trend towards the
centralisation of Higher Educa-
tion. Nevertheless, the Polytech-
nics and Colleges will be expected
to continue increasing their stu-
dent intake. Despite decreasing
numbers of part-time students
and a Â£20m 'top-up', the unit of
resource per student from the
central pool of money will drop
still further. Local Authorities,
who in the past were able to
provide extra money from their
budgets for Further Education;
also face strict spending limits
and are unwilling to increase
their contributions. This means,
in all probability, even bigger
classes with poor teaching. To
quote an extreme example, the
North East London Polytechnic
will have to declare at least 125
academics redundant by the end
of the year in order to comply
with N A B recommendations.
It appears, that from now on,
students entering polytechnics
are destined to receive a second-
class education.
Long Term Planning
Sir Keith Joseph has recently
asked for debate to be opened on
the issues that face Higher
Education over the next ten years
in order to formulate a long-term
strategy for the future of the
sector. For this reason the N A B
has initiated a consultation with
the Polytechnics and Colleges
under its supervision, and is
currently processing the replies to
this consultation. Towards the
end of last year the U G C sent out
its now famous '28 questions'
letter and opened a similar debate
within the Universities.
Such debate has been long
overdue, and the outcome will
have profound effects in subse-
quent years. The debate provides
a golden opportunity to reform
our Higher Education system.
This is necessary for a variety of
reasons. For instance, public
confidence in the present system
is not high. It is also necessary to
redefine the 'Robbins principle'
of access to Higher Education if
people with suitable ability but
without formal qualifications are
to be offered places on courses.
The need for reform has not
prevented severe criticism of, in
particular, the U G C consulta-
tion, since the emphasis within
their questionnaire is placed
heavily on financial and econo-
mic issues rather than on the
social purposes of education.
Universities are asked what
--changes they would make over
the period from the present until
1989/90 on the basis of steady
funding and alternatively on the
basis of a 1 or 2% cut in the unit
of resource per student every year
over this period. This follows
suggestions from Sir Keith
Joseph that cuts in the order of 5-
10% in University cash over the
next five years may well be
necessary in order to reach public
expenditure targets, although he
emphasizes that the Government
has no present intention to
implement any such cuts. This is
scant consolation to the Univer-
sities, who already consider
themselves to be receiving the
minimum amount of money
required to maintain academic
standards and who were told at
the lime of the 1981 cuts thatthey
would face no further reduction
m funding.
The UCiC questionnaire also
asks tor comments on a wide
range of related issues. These
include possibilities of lessening
dependence on public funds and
for shifting emphasis away from
the Humanities and towards
technical and scientific subjects.
Questions are also asked about
the nature of the 'binary divide'
between Universities and Poly-
technics and about the feasibility
of divorcing research from teach-
ing within the sector. Issues of
particular relevance to students
are raised, such as the possibility
of reducing degree lengths to two
years and the possibility of
introducing courses allowing
'conversion' between Arts and
Science subjects.
Individuals and interest groups
within Colleges have been asked
to put forward their own views in
order to make the debate as wide-
ranging as possible. However, it
is set within the constraints of the
current political thinking that
education is an expensive mill-
stone around the neck of the
economy and that it should
therefore be provided on utili-
tarian grounds alone.
