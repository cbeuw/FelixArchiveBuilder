The exhibition begins with a
potted history of Holography and
its development from its inven-
tion in 1948 to the present day
with examples of the early
holograms. There is then a
simple yet clear explanation of
holography and the way in which
different types of holograms are
produced. The most interesting
part of the exhibition (and the
part most people come to see) is
the holographic art gallery.
There is a great deal of resistance
within the art world to accepting
holograms as an art form. The
argument is that creative control
in the production of a hologram is
, limited, any spectacular results
are obtained through accident
rather than design. Holographic
art is as yet in its infancy the
works on display at the exhbition
t h o u g h f a s c i n a t i n g a n d
spectacular could not really be
described as masterpieces.
However the works do illustrate
the potential of holographic art,
making use of colour, form and
movement simultaneously in a
manner which has not been
possible with any other medium.
Eves Crystal I and II by
Linda Law both display
geometric crystalive structures,
bathed in an intense, almost
hypnotic green laser light.
A hologram differs somewhat
from a picture or slide in that
each point in the hologram
contains the whole image. If you
cut a piece off a hologram, you
can still see the whole image-
only the definition is reduced.
This makes the hologram a very
useful medium for storing data,
such as text, c o m p a r e d to
microfilm, as minor damage
does not cause any loss of
information.
Intcrferometry
At present, one of the most
important applications is inter-
ferometry. A double holographic
exposure of the object while
stressed and unstressed shows
light and dark bands which
cluster together near potential
fractures. The technique has
been applied to nuclear fuel
rods, loudspeaker cones, the
living human body, car tyres and
a host of engineering structures.
It is even possible to see shock
waves in the air due to the
passage of high velocity bullets.
Of course, for such applications,
very fast exposures are needed,
but lasers can supply pulses
shorter than a picosecond (a
million-millionth of a second) so
there is no problem.
Dennis Gabor, who lectured at Imperial, dis-
covered holography in 1948. As it required an
intense, monochromatic light source, it lay dor-
mant until 1960 and the invention of the laser.
You can marvel at just how much holography
has come on since then if you visit the Light
Dimensions Exhibition in the Science Museum.
Also, on Level 4, Sherfield, there is an exhibi-
tion of the life and work of Dennis Gabor, who
died in 1979.
One of the problems with
displaying holograms is thta
unless your eye is within the
correct angle of view you cannot
see the image. Tucked away in
the corner of the exhibition are a
series of three holograms of the
crucifixion of Christ which uses
this drawback very effectively.
The portraits seemingly jump out
at you, one after another as you
pass them.
12 Milliwatt boogie by
Rudie Barkhout is a very
ingenious white light transmis-
sion hologram. The holographic
plate has had several images
exposed to different parts of it
such that the image changes as
your eye moves across the plate,
providing a shifting kaleidoscope
of colour and shape. The artist
Rudie Berkhout says about is
work that he regards the viewer
as a needle of a record player
playing a hologram.
There are over 100 spectacu-
lar holograms by artists from all
over the world. The exhibition is
open seven days a week until 29
April. Y o u would be better to go
during a Weekday as the
exhibition is jam packed during
weekends. It is excellent value at
£1 for students (£1.75 otherwise)
and is a must for anyone interest
in holography.
Art and Restoration
In the Soviet Union, holograms
are taken of p r i c e l e s s art
treasures, so that Soviet citizens
from Kiev to Vladivostock can
visit travelling hologram shows
of their national heritage. When
restoring paintings, it is useful to
know if any areas of paint are
likely to chip and fall off. By
taking a double exposure and
warming the painting up by a
few degrees between exposures,
the weak spots in the paint can
be easily and safely identified.
Advertising
Holograms can be made to
'come out' of the plane of the
holographic plate and the effect
is so convincing that people
are willing to make fools of
themselves walking around the
image and trying to touch it.
This is very useful for advertising
and also for displaying objects
temporarily, for instance at
exhibitions, when the objects
are too large or fragile to
transport easily.
Portraits
Holographic portraiture is very
successful and uncannily lifelike.
There were initial problems due
to the fact that a living subject
has blood moving under the skin
and this motion destroys the
image. Ultrashort laser pulses
overcame this. Also, enlarged
pupils due to sitting in the dark
are prevented by shining a
bright light at the subject before
the exposure.
Optics
There are an enormous number
of applications in the field of
optics, for instance, head-up
displays for pilots attract a lot of
military funding. Also, optical
elements such as lenses can be
made from holograms. (There is
even some hope of making
holographic contact lenses.) Dr
Robin Smith of the physics
department designs holographic
microscope objectives and there
is much activity in holography in
the department's C o h e r e n t
Optics group.
