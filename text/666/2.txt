Dear Pallab
I was disturbed to note that in
last week's F E L I X the Selkirk
Hall Disco appreciation society
felt that the improvement in the
quality of a certain food product
by the Catering Manager should
have taken second place to the
weekly disco in Southside Bar.
Naturally, M r Mooney should
diversify his interest over the
whole of the refectory system,
though I have no doubt M r D
Rowe would believe that baked
beans should take a higher
priority than the weekly disco.
However, to set the residents of
Selkirk Hall at ease—not only
has M r Mooney improved the
quality of the baked beans in the
Union refectory but, contrary to
their accusation, has also agreed
to purchase new disco equipment
specifically for use in the South-
side weekly disco, and the
College has undertaken to
improve the 'sound proofing' of
the Real Ale Bar area such that
the discos and maybe even other
events will continue on a regular
basis! Perhaps M r Mooney is not
such a 'cheapskate' after all!
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
Please could you. confirm
whether rumours I have been
hearing about one of the Union
media (not F E L I X ) are true or
not . It has come to my attention
that the medium in question has
denied membership to certain
students purely on the basis of the
personal feelings of the commit-
tee. Not content to discriminate
against those they do not like, the
friends of the banned students
have been feeling the wrath of the
current Junta. One such friend
was to conduct an interview with
a celebrity and had done a great
deal of background research only
to be told that he wouldn't be
doing the interview afer all.
Instead, his place has been filled
by an ex-member of College who
has had no experience of such
interviews and who is no longer
in the union.
I can already hear the cynical
saying, 'So what?' But I believe it
is important that everyone who
holds a unioncard should at least
be allowed the opportunity to
join every college society. Of
course it will be difficult to prove
this state of affairs but if matters
change because of this letter then
the issue will no longer be
important.
Such a change is unlikely, but if
the present situation goes on un-
criticised, then the video-nasties
will surely have won.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Ghosh
Many congratulations to your
sports page editor for managing
to reduce the normal two pages of
sport to just one side of bland
reports. We note that only five
clubs could be bothered to
submit articles which conformed
to your stringent guidelines.
We sincerely hope that you
manage to remove the sports
page altogether by the end of the
year.
Yours sincerely

actually read F E L I X but on the
assumption that some do we try
to publicise our events in it, it
seems, however, that you have
other plans. If you cast your mind
back to last term you may
remember we complained about
this to you both verbally and in
writing. Needless to say you did
not print the letter of complaint
and you are still as unhelpful as
ever. Perhaps if you cut out half
of those boring film/theatre
reviews (which nobody I know of
reads) you might just be able to
find room for a paragraph or two
about us.
Yours with considerable annoyance

PS: If this letter gets printed I will
be unable to contain my joy.
Ed's Note Clubs articles and
What's On entries will not be
published if they are submitted
after the Monday 1:00pm
deadline. Neither will they be
published if they consist of the
inconsequential irrelevant drivel
that you regularly submit
Priority is given to concise
informative articles that
advertise forthcoming events.

Dear Pallab
I just thought you might like to
know that somebody out here (ie
me) thinks you are doing a really
pathetic job. Over the last two
weeks Astrosoc has submitted
two entries for the clubs column
and two for What's On. Of these
you condescended to print part of
the last entry for What's On,
most generous of you. It may not
have occurred to you that people
mascotry, but also that many
regard it as the epitome of
mindlessness? He even sneers
that 95% of Chelsea College
students 'haven't even seen their
anchor'. —Lucky 95%!
Outside readers might assume
that the letter was written by a
typical IC student whereas it was
in fact written by a typical C C U
(RCSU) hack—a very different
thing.
I believe that the rift between
most IC students and the CCU's
is very large, and that the latter's
activities can be summed up as
kissing each others arses and
pretending they are doing it for
everyone else's benefit.
The strange ratio of the sexes in
this College goes hand in hand
with the mascotry mentality and
the ratio will only improve as
science and technology attracts
more rounded personalities al-
together.

Dear Pallab
I suggest that the obnoxious
Simon Banton's letter in Feb 2's
edition of London Student does
much more damage where it
matters to this College's image
than anything which Michael
Newman is responsible for.
Indeed, while Michael Newman's
campaign against Mines' ridicu-
lous porn night shows a glint of
human values within the College,
Simon's ranting letter on mas-
cotry suggests strongly that the
writer is a moron. Is he unaware
that not only are the majority of
London students uninterested in
Dear Sir,
Having read your report in
your January 19th issue, I feel
your readers should have the
record set straight as regards
our Mascdtry activities.
F i r s t l y : " M a r y " the
leopard (which is incidentally
plaster and wood, not con-
crete) belongs to Queen
Mary College, not Chelsea.
Secondly: Chelsea Col
lege's mascot is an anchor,
not a leopard.
Thirdly: The ransom paid
by Q M C was a cheque for
£40 and 80 pints of blood, the
cheque and a receipt for the
blood being handed over on }
Wednesday the 11th of Janu- J
ary outside the Royal School {
of Hygiene, opposite SOAS 2
in Malet Street. In return we
loaded the leopard into
Q M C ' s van in order for them
to take it home.
Fourthly: To our know- 1
ledge, neither Q M C , who
paid the cheque, nor Chelsea,
who didn't, have cancelled it.
I am glad Steve Woodward
has got something to gloat \
about, considering that 95% T.
of Chelsea College students \
neither know of, nor have /
ever seen, their anchor. I
Indeed* the majority of stu- J
dents there that have heard {
rumours of a mascot, firmly
believe that it is dumped in
!
^he River Thames!
Lastly: It was the Royal
College of Science Union that
relieved Q M C of their mascot
two years ago, and we are
proud to be an Independent
part ot Imperial Colllege!
Yours faithfully
Simon Banton
