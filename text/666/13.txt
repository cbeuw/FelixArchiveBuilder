Semi Final
IC 1st X V were beaten 0-11 by a
well drilled side from West-
minster Hospital Medical School
at Harlington on Wednesday.
The win earned Westminster a
place in the final of the University
of London's Gutteridge Cup
Final.
Captain Dave McGee's team,
urged on by a multitude of loyal
supporters, maintained constant
pressure throughout the match
with grim determination.
But it was the mistakes and
missed chances that cost IC the
match. It started off well
balanced but IC gave away a
penalty after a somewhat suspect
decision.
In the scrum and lineouts
which were frequent Westminster
dominated with their well re-
hearsed set moves, IC finding it
hard at times to secure their own
balls from the scrum.
Hopes returned to the now
cold team of supporters ten
minutes from the end. At least
