More lowdpwns and hot tips for
1984 from the FELIX music page
LIVE!
Not for the first time this year a support band eclipsed the
headliners at an Ents gig. Friday's billtoppers RED LORRY
YELLOW LORRY were content to stand still and pound away
at their guitars in a one dimensional attack on the senses.
Unlike other practitioners of this bludgeoning form of new
wave—eg the Nightingales-RLYL seem to take themselves
very seriously and fail to show even the slightest hint of a
sense of humour. Like much of the malaise/magnificence
associated with the bleakest of the eighties bands RLYL
problems/ strengths (delete latter) are directly traceable to
Joy Division's first album. Whereas most listened with
amazement to the redefinitions of the previously anaerobic
constraints of guitar, bass and drums RLYL heard little more
than the guitar grossout that was Interzone and failed to notice
that even it kicked ass.
Kicking ass is not a term to be applied to the Skeletal
Family, they prefer to whip their audience into a frenzy with
a compulsive beat overlaid by guitarists Stan's contributions
of multitextured guitar distortions which combine primitive
brutality and joy in equal measures. Dominating the sound is
eye-catching singer Anne Marie, swathed in yards of white
cotton save her black dancing pumps and coloured crimped
fringe. She soars, wails and whoops as well as Slouxsle and
the band are commited to a direction the Banshees will never
be brave enough to follow again. Overall their ability and
total lack of pretension leave most similar gothic types for

SINGLES
My opinions of the SKELETAL FAMILY are stated above
and there seems little point saying anything more about their
single SHE CRIES ALONE (RED RHINO) bar 1) it's very
good, especially played loud 2) the B-side The Wind Blows is
also very good 3) it's available from Rough Trade (Colville
Terrace) 4) the lead singer has an Irish background—what
more could one want?
BOURGIE BOURGIE seem to have caused an awful lot of
press interest considering THE BREAKING POINT is their
first single. This seems largely due to the recent
preponderance of new young Scottish bands. Interesting and
well performed as it is the single seems little more than a
further example of what now shall be called the 'New
Retrospection'. Bowie sound-alike Paul Quinn sings well over
a James Bond type orchestration (ie ABC) on the A-side, a
dead ringer for an Undertones riff on the B-side and
although overnight stardom seems far away a Q-Tips live
reputation seems highly probable.
