Ah, But Your Land is
Beautiful by Alan Paton
Set in South Africa in the 1950s,
Ah But Your Land is Beautiful
traces the lives of a number of
people struggling against the
r e s t r i c t i o n s of a p a r t h e i d .
Brought together by joining the
newly formed Liberal Party, the
book traces their progress as the
party fights against a hostile
establishment.
Alan Paton writes in a
passionate style, which though
disjointed makes the book
difficult to put down. Written
from a variety of viewpoints
including that of a junior
government minister who
justifies the governments actions
in frequent letters to his aunt, all
his characters achieve a high
degree of credibility whatever
their political standpoint. For a
person unused to the philosophy
and practice of apartheid many
of the attitudes of the characters
in the book may seem so alien, as
to be unbelievable, but the power
of Alan Paton's writing will leave
the reader in no doubt by the end
of the book. Whatever the
opinions of the person reading
this book they cannot help but be
m o v e d by this p o w e r f u l
passionate novel, a book that it
will be difficult to forget

The Cement Garden - Ian
McEwan (Picador) £1.95
This is a splendid modern short
novel, which can be read in one
sitting. It is one reason why
McEwan stands in the front of
the young novelists of the 80s
It's the story of how a family of
four children handle the event of
their mother's death, told from
the view of an adolescent boy.
This makes the book seem very
fresh, and McEwan's descrip-
tions are first rate. It's a book that
makes you want to read it; a
forthright n o v e l with an
unpleasant ending.

The Power and the Glory -
Graham Greene.
The single man is on the run. He
is the last Catholic priest in a
country that has outlawed them.
A state of religious persecution.
Through the failings of this
whiskey drinking priest, his
failure to communicate, his
failure to help and gain love from
his illegitimate daughter, his
failure to repent his sins this
pathetic character, portrayed so
well by Graham Greene, evokes
from the reader more than mere
sympathy giving a common
sense of humanity. We feel this is
what real heroes are about,
human weakness and the fight
against it.
Only at the very end do we see
in the death of the priest his
success. The tragic ending
revealing 'The Power and the
Glory' of the priest's life. Rather
than cry at his execution I was
filled with the feeling of wonder
and beauty of what he had left. A
strangely happy ending even for
those readers who do not
believe.

Reviews
On the Black Hill - Brue
Chatwin (Picador) £1.95
This was a book I had heard
a b o u t as b e i n g h i g h l y
r e c o m m e n d e d , a m o d e r n
masterpiece and so on. I had
been looking forward to reading
it, and yet dreading to start it in
case I just couldn't get into it.
Now, having read the book, I
think it does indeed deserve its
high critical acclaim.
The novel covers the lifespan
of twin Welsh border farmers
from childhood until one died at
80 years of age. Chatwin is forced
by the nature of his characters to
w r i t e m u c h a b o u t t h e
countryside. H e does so,
successfully, writing both with
the passion of the aesthete and
an understanding of the farming
community.
The book is a series of short
chapters each covering events
from some period of the twins'
lives. The themes running
constantly through the tbook are
technology, pacifism, the nature
of a small community and the
bond between the twins.
A marvellous experience, and
well worth reading.

The Life and Times of
K - J M Coetzee (Seeker &
Warby) £7.95
J M C o e t z e e a highly
a c c l a i m e d S o u t h A f r i c a n
novelist, presents a serious and
unconventional new book. It is
the story of Michael K, who is
mentally deficient, in his
attempts to avoid a war that is
being waged in S Africa. Much of
Michael's behaviour is hard to
understand. He tries to find a
place away from the war, but it
always catches up on him; part of
his struggle is in the form of
fasting, which is unconscious at
first.
Towards the end of the book,
the format is changed, and the
story is told by the medical officer
of a rehabilitation camp where
Michael is held. The M O
s t r u g g l e s to u n d e r s t a n d
M i c h a e l s p r o t e s t . H e is
frustrated by Michael's star.ee
but eventually thinks he
understands him, and is in awe of
the protest.
Michael is just one civilian
caught in the reality of war, from
which he cannot escape. But he
tries to live his life as he wants as
much as is possible, even though
this may be life on a very minimal
basis. This is a book which
frustrates the reader and has him
in terror of the unpleasant social
c o n s e q u e n c e s w h i c h are
unescapable in war.
