Estates Washed Out
In Paint Fiasco
It should have been a red letter
day for RCS Motor Club last
Tuesday! Their prayers (requests
to Estates) and patience had been
rewarded! The yellow lines to
oust the pesky parkers outside
their garage were being painted.
They were overjoyed!
Until it started to rain that is!
And it was then that they
realised that Estates had used
water-soluble paint!
'Now you see them, now you
don't,' said an RCS Motor Club
spokesman as he watched the
yellow lines disappear in a
rainstorm.
'There'll be some red faces in
Estates tonight,' he added.
The garage is used to house the
RCS motorised mascot Jezebel, a
1903 Dennis fire engine.
RCS Motor Club were getting
hot under the collar when people
started parking their cars outside
the door, making access to the
garage impossible.
It is hoped that Estates may re-
paint the lines. And next time
they won't use a water soluble
paint!
Leading the Way
A four year extension to a
contract for research into lead
dust in the environment has been
awarded to Dr Iain Thornton of
the Applied Geochemistry Re-
search Group in the Geology
department. The contact is
awarded by the Department of
Environment.
The work which began in 1981,
involves the study of lead,
cadmium and other heavy metals
in urban and rural dusts and
soils. A massive survey was
conducted during the first two
years of the study. Dusts from
schools, floors and streets were
sampled. The survey will now be
extended to include lead in old
paints and from car exhaust
fumes. The levels of lead to which
young children are exposed will
be investigated, in particlar.
Paddy's Punch Up
IC. Union Hon Sec Sean Davis
was nearly arrested last Tuesday
during the Guilds Field Cup
event when he threw a punch at
prs of the Guilds marshalls
supervising the competition.
The object of the event is to
collect points by drinking,
collecting treasure and carrying
out odious tasks in a number of
local pubs. Sean Davis was
prevented from entering one of
the pubs by a member of another
team, lost his temper and threw a
punch. The landlord of the pub
responded by calling the police.
However our Hon Sec, as elusive
as ever, escaped before the paddy
wagon arrived.
A Guildsman was not so lucky
when during the event he was
caught red handed by the police
attempting to remove a car
registration plate (one of the
items of treasure).
As a result of the treasure
collecting Beit Quad was
festooned with red bicycle racks,
wheel barrows, bricks and
Sainsburys trollys on Wednesday
night.

Clement's Freudian
Theories
Clement Freud, MP and Liberal
M r Clement Freud M P spoke on
'The Future of British Education'
at a meeting organised by the
Liberal Club on Tuesday. In an
informal atmosphere, facilitated
by an audience of around twenty-
five, M r Freud discussed the
problems facing higher education
in this country.
It was the policy of the present
government, he said, to place
economic considerations above
political or educational ones. A
generally short-sighted approach
was being adopted, little care
being taken to ensure that the
system was capable of sustaining
Club Chairman Simon Nield.
the recommended cuts, so
damaging institutions and the
people within them. In fact, the
Tory party has no education
policy as such; education is
merely affected by the financial
policies.
The aim of a Liberal govern-
ment, said M r Freud, would be to
provide as many people as
possible with the opportunity of
going into higher education, and
to broaden the pattern of access
involving the inclusion of extra-
mural courses. They would also
try to break down some of the
barriers between work, leisure
and education.
Merlyn Toes the Line
But He's not Fooling Anyone
Last Tuesday Labour M P Merlyn
Rees spoke to an audience of
about fifty students on 'Labour
Party Defence Policy'.
M r Rees explained that the
Labour Party manifesto repre-
s e n t e d the v i e w s o f o n e
conference and should not be
taken as permanent. He believed
the defence policies had to be put
to the people in a more credible
way, and may need to be
modified.
He attacked the government's
increased defence expenditure,
particularly on the Trident
system, but gave the warning that
if we were to unilaterally give up
our nuclear defence Britain
would need a greatly increased
conventinonal defence.
Mr Rees has often been seen
as a strong opponent of Labour's
defence policy within the party.
In his speech at College whilst
indicating criticism of the defence
p o l i c y he stQpped short of
outright opposition to it.
