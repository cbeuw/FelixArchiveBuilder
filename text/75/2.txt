2 FELIX
P R O F I L E
is. sum
John ia the rather rotund figure who has
been the unobtrusive but guiding hand on Felix
this year. A l l of you w i l l remember the
"Freshers' Felix", which was sold on the f i r s t
day of last term, and on the three preoeeding
days. Few of you w i l l realize the tremendous
amount of work whioh John did to make i t sueh
a success. The record sale speaks for his
organising a b i l i t y , and energy.
He refused to say where he was born, but
he was brought up i n Minehead, Zummerzet, where
he broke his nose. In John's own words, "It
happened when I f e l l out of my pram after being
bitten by a dog!" In Minehead he went to a
co-ed school, but didn't like i t , and left at
the early age of sixteen to become a M.O.S.
apprentice at Malvern.
After working on radar equipment for a
couple of years, he came to Guilds i n 1951 as
a f i r s t year electrical engineer. For the
next two years, John said he was a brown-bagger
- singing as a tenor in the Imperial College
Choir, and working as a conscientious helper on
Felix. He played rugby, but a slipped disc i n
his spine brought a premature cessation to his
athletic pursuits. S t i l l an active ohorister,
John i s a p i l l a r of the tenors. At a l l Felix
meetings, hl3 advice is.valued. He i s a member
of the sedate body known as the Residents'
Committee, through which he now owns the largest
bed i n the Old Hostel.
His likes? Well, these are many and var-
ied, but amongst the more predominant are music,
both classical and contemporary, Valerie, and the
quietness of the f i f t h floor of the Old Hostel.
He says that he dislikes work, but the
intricate structure with which he labours as a
post-graduate has received regular attention at
his hands. Confidentially, John HATED writing
Editorials. He invariably l e f t these t i l l the
last minute, i n the hope that news could go i l l
the column instead I
SWEET THAMES RUN SOFTLY.
Shivering on the hard at Chiswiok under the
unfriendly eyes of U.C,L.S.E. and the rest, stand
five f r a i l Icwarians. These are the dauntless
few who chose to row and braved the storm of dis-
approval from Putney. And how, you may ask, i s
the I.C.W.B.C. ooxed four faring" The answer i s
quite simple - we're doing a l l right. We haven't
put on pounds of muscle, our hands are only very
slightly blistered and we haven't fallen i n (yet!).
The i n i t i a l d i f f i c u l t i e s have now been sur-.
mounted and we were very glad to receive some good
coaching during this period. Now, after tanking
and tubbing, we have ventured out i n a clinker.
None of us care to remember the f i r s t time - we
must have resembled an agitated water beetle, but
we kept afloat. The second time out there was an
immense Improvement and a l l Is now set f a i r .
Except - doesn't anyone want to coach us?

HOUSE PARTIES
Sleeping i n the bedrooms, sleeping in the
barn, and i n the games room - and even in the
local Youth Hostel - Two hot water bottles, and
ton blankets - Everybody welcome. Come In, i f
you can get In'. Such was the s p i r i t of the two
winter house parties run by the I.C. Christian
Union.
In the days when many societies have good
cause to complain of student apathy and disinter-
est, I t Is a pleasant change to find a committee
running round in circles to accommodate a demand
far exceeding anything i n previous years. About
f i f t y people took part on each occasion, and a
very helpful and enjoyable time was had by a l l .
Washing up, and pleasant company were by kind co-
operation of a small party from Q.E.C. Christian
Union.
Our host at the second party was Mr. Metcalfe
C o l l i e r , by now a well known figure at I.C.
Many of us had cause to be grateful for the help
and advice of a man with 33 years of v i t a l
Christian living behind him. He spoke to us on
"The Second Coming of Christ." The fact that
this event Is coming as surely as the June exam-
inations was clearly set forth, and with i t the
age-old c a l l of the Gospel. To those apart from
God, the c a l l to reconciliation, - to the Chris-
tian, the c a l l to a holy and consecrated l i f e .
The value of these housepartles can only be
measured i n terms of our answer to this c a l l .

YMWELIAD I GYMRY
On Wednesday, 2nd March sixty Goildanen spent an
exotio day as guests of a group of electrical companies
in South Wales.
The party wont to Newport by train and on to the
works of South Wales Switehgear Ltd. at Blackwood by
ooaoh. Directors of the firm and a representative of
the Welsh proas aooopanied us to lunch after whioh the
Managing Director, Mr. A.J. Nicholas, described the
basic principles of Switqhgear. The works went to
considerable trouble to make the visit interesting and
numerous exhibits and demonstrations had bean arranged
in the factory.
Saying good-bye to the guides we entered the
ooaohaa again and crossedsonny valleys on the waytoa
Cable works in Abardare. nor* wo were conducted round
the factory and given an excellent tea. We thanked
our host* and retained to Newport in time for the 7.20
train to London. After fifteen minutes wait everybody
was becoming a little restive and i t was a relief for
the station master when the train arrived, greeted ay
the roar of a Boomalaka. In spite of arriving nearly
an hour late at Paddingten, credit i s due to British
Railways for the first class dinner that waa served.
Shsnry and beer were also provided - in fact instead
of taking part in the usual pub crawl i t
appeared that we wore in a crawling pub! Our bene-
factors oertainly know the best way to a Guildaman'a
heart. One theory explaining the slow progress of the
train. Was that the insulation paper, streaming from
the windows, had wound round the axles of the coaches.
The party rolled out of the coaches at T0.45 p.m. and
finished the day with another Xoomalaka.
It is with pleasure that we will r—smber what
anst have boon the most lavish visit ever offered to
the Inginserlng Society.
