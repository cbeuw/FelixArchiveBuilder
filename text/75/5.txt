GUILDS VOTE "de-bag"
Guildsmen packed into Room 17 last Thursday
bo attend what, has been one of the most l i v e l y
Union meetings i n reoent years. I t started when the
minutes were questioned — am unheard of event i n
the lives of many present. Andy Levine, Guilds
president, opened business with the reading of a
letter from the president of Heading University,
who wanted some coloured bulbs returned .
Unfortunately, the bulbs, having attended the last
two Carnivals, were i n no condition to be returned
and because or the financial i n s t a b i l i t y of the
Heading union a cash repayment, together, with
twenty-one coloured oandleBjfor good measure, werj
to be presented to our poorer neighbours.
The seoond item on the agenda was one of
considerable importance as Keith M i l l e r emphasise
when he said that the measure he advooated would
net to form the Guildsman of the future into a
f u l l y mature engineer i n spite of the proposed
increase i n numbers whioh might otherwise have
prevented him taking part i n Union a c t i v i t i e s . J
a very large majority, the house passed the motioi
in favour of a Fresher's Dinner, i n whioh each
"Freshman" would have his own host for the eveninj
This host would pay a l l , or part of, the oost of'
the dinner.
A plea for less course work and a proposed
criticism form on lecturers was loudly applauded
Then followed a stormy and widely differing
discussion on college hours, the original proposal
being to lengthen the lunoh-hour on every day of t l
wdek. Mr.MaoKenzie expressed moot people's feelijs
on saying "Let us not tamper with the college hour*
against the wishes of the majority." The basic iaa
behind the proposal was to enable the smallest olubss
to attract more members, but i t was. f e l t that these
olubs were i n a definite minority.
Keith M i l l e r was on his feet again, this
time i n indignation at the queue-jumping at tea-time
in Queenies, and wishing to l i m i t each person to one
cup of tea. "I was twenty-fourth i n the queue one
day," he said "and I had the forty-eighth cup of teaJ"
The house was amused, and before most people realised
i t , the motionthat "Any person who i s obviously queue
jumping i n the tea queue should have his trousers
removed and suspended from the flag-pole outBide Guilds"
was proposed, seconded and carried i n a storm of cheers
Ivan Abbott leaped up and cried to the president "We
have passed a dangerous motion." A sotto voioe
suggested he should see a.doctor.
Finally, an nour after the meeting began, Mr.
Graham proposed that Mr. Kenneth Horne should be eleoted
an honorary member of the Union to give Guilds the
"right sort of publioity".
As soon as the president brought the meeting to
a close however, a crowd of j o s t l i n g , laughing Guildsmen
hurried to Queenies to debag the f i r s t queue-jumper.
We wonder what the form i s i n the case of a her, not
a himl
