The extraordinary tale of
Scene I
A deserted refectory, save for a solitary
figure, slouched over his empty gruel bowl.
A Chorus of Waitresses is assembled off-
stage.
Eric Darbyshire, for it is he, lifts his gruel
bowl, and staggers towards Mr Mooney.
Eric: Please, Mr Mooney, may I have some
more.
Mr Mooney: More? More? MORE!?! N o
one has ever asked for more.
Mr Mooney clicks hisfingers and the Chorus
of Spanish Waitresses trumps in.
Chorus of waitresses (singing in Spanish
accents)
Darbyshire, Darbyshire, Never before has a
boy wanted more,
Darbyshire, Darbyshire
Non haciendo, senor, per favor.
Mr Mooney: For God sake shut-up, you old
bags, or I'll send you back to Fulham where I
found you.
(turning to Eric) And as for you, young fellow
me lad, you good-for-nothing layabout —
you'd better go before the Rector.
Eric: But what use would I be to him? I'm
good for nothing (rubbing his eyes blearily).
Mooney: Are you ideed? Well you're
banished to Estates, in that case.
Eric packs his belongings into a soiled
handkerchief, and is escorted out of the
kitchens by Choruses of Waitresses. They
take him to the Estates Department where
the Fire Alarms, Telephones and other
disasters are arranged.
Scene II
Union Office
The Union Office staff sit around with their
feet up, slurping sherry, and complaining
about their work-load.
Aunty Jenny is getting sherry from the
intravenous drip, Dave Parry.
Suddenly the befuddled calm of the office is
shattered as Hippo Claybrain hurtles in:
Hippo: Snort, pew, grunt.
Aunty Jenny: Darling, what do you mean
'Mooney's banished Eric'. Where's he
banished him to?
Hippo: Estates,snort.
Aunty Jenny: Oh don't worry dearie — it'll
be weeks before they do anything to him.
Have a nice sherry — it'll help you get your
breath back.
Hippo: Gosh, thanks Aunty.
Aunty serves the sherry - but unseen by the
others sneaks off into her office and dials
one-seven-oh, the. secret hot-line to the
Rector.

Scene III
Rector's Flat
Ian Bull sits on the hearth-rug in the Rector's
drawing room, idly stoking the fire. The
Rector reclines in a deep arm chair giving Ian
his instructions for the week. Every few
minutes Sir Henry Bufton-Tufton of that Ilk,
Governor-in-Chief, jumps out from behind
the sofa and shouts 'I disagree, I disagree'!
The Rector ignores these interjections.
Suddenly a red and gold telephone rings
faintly - the Rector answers.
Rector: Hallo, Baron of Queensgate.
Aunty Jenny (for it is she): Hallo, dearie.
Can you tell lan, they've varnished the Union
gates.
Rector: Can you speak up, please. This is a
College telephone, you know.
Aunty Jen (screeching) C A N Y O U TELL
IAN, T H E Y ' V E BANISHED ERIC T O
ESTATES.
The Rector drops the telephone receiver and
turns to Ian, who is by now asleep.
Rector: Wake up, young fool, they've
banished Eric to Estates.
Sir Bufton-Tufton: Don't call me a fool, you
old fool.
Rector: Not you, you fool, it's Ian I'm talking
to.
Ian (awake): But what am I going to do?
Rector: I don't know, go and get him back, I
expect.
Ian: But I can't do that. Nobody ever returns
from Estates.
Lady Flowers enters, stage left, obeying the
no entry signs pinned to the other doors,
carrying a tray of sausages.
Lady Flowers: Come on, you've all got to
eat up your bangers — I won't take no for an
answer!
Ian: (groan) Oh, all right then, just one
more.
As Ian eats the sausage, a curious
tranformation takes place. Horns begin to
sprout from his head, his nose becomes
broader, and his ears long and hairy. He
starts grunting and snorting, and then
charges towards the open French Windows,
and out into the garden.
Lady Flowers: Well that's what I call
gratitude — I shall never hold another beer
and bangers as long as I live.
Scene IV
Eric in Estates
Eric sits in the Estates lair. He is alone, for
the entire Estates section is 'in a meeting'
according to their secretary. Around Eric,
on the floor, lie hundreds of old dial
telephones removed by Estates during the
phone modernization scheme.
Eric lifts one of the dirty instruments, and
idly starts to rub the handset.
Suddenly, in a puff of smoke, a figure
appears.
Aunty Jenny: Hallo dearie, your wish is my
command.
Eric: (Rubbing his bleary eyes) But who
are You?
Aunty Jenny: Why I'm the Jenny of the
phone of course, your fairy godmother. Now
what's your first wish.
Eric; Well, I'd like a sherry, please.
Aunty Jenny: Yes, of course deary. But
what sort.
Eric: I'll have a pale, please.
Aunty Jenny: (giggling) A pail? Why dearie,
isn't the glass big enough?
Aunty Jenny (handing Eric the sherry): And
for your second wish?
Eric: Oh that's easy. Please get me out of
Estates — I can't bear all this sitting around,
doing nothing.
Aunty Jenny skips round the sherry bottle
three times and taps it with her wand.
Just at that moment the mad bull crashes
through the flimsy Estates doors and
screeches to a halt.
Aunty Jenny and Eric jump on his back
and he charges out towards Mooney's
kitchens.
Scene V
Mr Mooney's kitchen (later)
The three chefs prance naked around the
stove incanting:
Double, double boil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Eye of newt, and toe of frog
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog.
Mooney: By the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.
Enter mad Bull, Eric and Aunty Jenny.
Accompanied by Hippo, the Rector, Sir
Henry Bufton-Tufton of that Ilk, Chorus of
Waitresses, Dave Parry's girlfriend,
Refectory Suggestions and Complaints
Committee, Internal Services Committee
and the combined Refectory Boycott.
Aunty Jenny: Oh Victor dearie, I implore
you, won't you relent? Won't you release
Eric from his banishment?
Rector: He'll never do it.
Sir Bufton.Tufton: Oh yes he will!
Rector: Oh no he won't.
Sir Henry Bufton-Tufton: et omnes: O H
YES HE WILL!
Mooney: Stop, stop, stop. I will do it, but
only if you can beat my chorus of
Waitresses at a bun fight!
Everyone: All right!
Chorus of Waitresses waddle out on to the
main refectory armed with Mooney's rock
buns.
Aunty Jenny: Come on dearies — we can
easily beat them — arm yourselves with
baked minced beef rolls.
But suddenly a hush descends over the
assembled hordes, with a glint in his eye
Mooney wheels in his gleaming sausage
trumpet. And it is pointing directly at them -
for a moment no one moves. But then Hippo
strides across the refectory and defiantly
jumps into the barrel of the trumpet
Hippo (laughing as she is drawn into the
mechanism): N o sausage trumpet can
survive this!
Mooney: Damn it! She's jammed my
trumpet. I concede. I concede. Eric is
unbanished!
Everyone: (Cheering)
The crowd disperses, everyone going back
to their ordinary jobs, to continue their work
of old.
As they leave:
Mooney (to Ian): Just one question, Ian.
Why are you dressed up as a lamb?
