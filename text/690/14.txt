SINGLES
Toy Dolls: Nellie The Elephant
It's a rerelease but I had to
review it. I had only ever heard
'Jitterbugging' by the Dolls
until last week when this came
out. Within two days I'd
bought it. What can you say?
Well, if you've ever enjoyed
yourself you'll love this. At IC
Radio, everyone, from the
classical show presenter, to
the heavy metal DJ say it's
great. So do I.
Fraggles: All Around The
World
A couple of months ago, did
you get as pissed off as I did
with idiots putting on Fraggle
voices! I hope this is aflopjust
so they don't all start again.
Having just listened to the
Toy Dolls I can find absolutely
nothing I like about this one.
Another song, with nothing
lyrics, nothing tune and
nothing appeal.
Lou Read: lLove You Suranne
Starts like a Trio song but
soon breaks into an American
funky rock song with a god
awful clapping machine in the
background. As a rule I don't
like American rock. This is no
exception. The flip, 'Vicious',
is produced by Dave Bowie,
but seems like a failed Stones
.take off. Forget it, Lou,
whatever you do I prefer the
Toy Dolls!
Meat loaf: Nowhere Fast
The follow-up to 'Modern
Girl' is also from the highly
s u c c e s s f u l a l b u m ' B a d
Attitude'. Mr Loaf has at last
got back the excitement of
'Bat Out Of Hell' and with
'Nowhere Fast' I think he'll
regain his rightful place at the
top of the rock world.
Stevie Wonder: Love Light In
Flight
Believe it or not (and you
p r o b a b l y w o n ' t ! ) S t e v i e
actually asked me if I thought
this would make a good
single. I said yes (well what
else do y o u say to a
megastar?) but now I'm not so
sure. A good quality sound,
excellent production, but I'm
afraid it does nothing for me.
Perhaps that's just 'cause I
love his ballads. I'll tell him
next time!!
Kenny & Dolly: Christmas
Without You
I bet this gets played all the
time on Radio Two. Apparent-
ly it's from the new 'Once
Upon a Christmas' album. I
can just see my grannie
getting it this year, and
subjecting us all to aural
purgatory when I want to see
the Top Of The Pops special.
Thank G o d for videos!

THEATRE
The problem with reviewing
Dramsoc plays is that by the
time this is published it'll be
too late to see the play
anyway. Which is a shame for
those who missed this their
latest offering, the third
production this season.
Pythagoras is a light-
h e a r t e d c o m e d y with a
thoughful message. Set in a
mental hospital, the play
derives its humour mainly
form the antics of the patients.
W h i l s t n o r m a l l y s u c h a
subject could be considered
risque, it's all done in the best
possible taste.
John Burgess is well cast as
the megalomanical Pytha-
goras. Convinced he is the
reincarnation of the Greek
mathematician he is able to
cause thunder and lightening,
make the phone ring at will, do
difficult calculations in his
head and generally walk on
water. When cured and back
to sanity he loses these
a b i l i t i e s a n d h i s s e l f
confidence. With the other
parts, whilst one or two of the
characters were either slightly
unconvincing or a bit over
played, on the whole the
s t a n d a r d of a c t i n g was
commendably high.
Thursday night, Coronet
Street in the basement of a
converted warehouse, an old
man with sunken eyes and
long flowing beard moves up
to the stage microphone
amidst whistles and applause
for a handful of hard-boppers,
now settling themselves in the
bar. 'Tell allyourfriendsabout
us', he cries. 'Running a club;
well its no trip, but its a
groove'. The band is the
intensely powerful Weller
Spring Quartet. The M C is
Peter Ind, one time session

musician for Bird and Davis,
now co-director of Wave
Recording Studios, below
which his club, the Bass Clef,
is based.
Although open for just three
months, Mr Ind has already
made the Clef a name to
remember, alongside Ronnies
and the 100 Club, as a place to
find serious music of all types
in the jazz spectrum. With an
enormous backup of artists to
call on, it can provide live
m u s i c , l u n c h t i m e a n d
evening, six days a week.
Thursday's offering of hard-
bop clinched it. Friday night
came early; Weller, tight-as a
kettle drum, lauched some
terrific riffs on occasions,
constantly nagged, as ever by
hypnotically precise rhythm
work from Brian Spring. Errol
Clark, all too often too quiet to
be heard, is a terrific pianist,
and the intimate atmosphere
was well suited to giving him a
fair hearing. The syncopation
has shifted from Spring to
Weller since I last saw them
two years ago, but they're still
red hot and razor sharp.
In the recording studio
above the club, I talked to Ind
more closely about his new
ventures. Having spent much
of his life in New York and the
States, he was well aware of
the lack of proper jazz-venture
in London. Stateside clubs

never seem to close; they're
always ticking over, always
busy. Since the demise of the
dance halls in the forties and
fifties, however, jazz over here
has revolved around the 'jazz-
pub'. Beer, skittles and blues,
but at the patron's discretion
a n d s u b j e c t to n o r m a l
licensing hours. Some pubs
have tried to overcome the
problem, (the Bull and Gate in
Kentish Town uses its large
snooker hall and stage to seat
400 people) but with no base
to rehearse and work from,
many musicians find con-
stanty 'touring London' hard
whilst many others never see
the light of day.
Many jazz enthusiasts think
that the few late-night clubs
that do exist in the capital
have a monopoly on the
scene. Ronnie Scotts, the hub
of London's jazz club network
is exorbitantly expensive,
attracting an elite of wealthy
posers, with little interest in
hard jazz. But Ind defends
Ronnies, ('He helped me open
this place'). The acts Scott
brings over from the States
have to be paid for, air fare and
all. So artists play at Ronnies
for weeks, not nights and get
to know the place before
going home. How does Peter
Ind expect to do the same?
American jazz-players have
recorded at Wave for a long
time now, (most recently
guitarist, Buddy de Franco
laying down a new L P called
'A Chip off the Old Blop').
Other muscians he can catch
on tour or from the national
festivals. 'Of course, its early
days yet', but Ind has many
contacts. And for clubs who
have no studios or capital or
contacts? 'Well, its no trip but
its a groove'.
