ORIENTEERING
Weekend
orgy?
T'was the 'o'-event to end them
all when Imperial took on Oxford
University, Kent Poly, and
everyone else last weekend in
Scrotty Woods.
Browning really put the skids
under the opposition for a van-
slide win in M2IE, beating Bloor
(who hadn't drawn the map this
week) and the top Imperial men.
Forster ran like he was carrying a
sackful of potatoes, while Andy
and his E X V O C chums had
stopped to play with the sheep.
Eppington, who had drunk a
whole pint of cider the night
before (Sally helped) didn't feel
well at all; while Wu wan the
wong way and hasn't been seen
since.
Meanwhile, in W21, Sally was
left holding the trophy after a
Controller's enquiry into Patsy's
elastic stocking revealed the
shocking truth!
TABLE TENNIS
Close to
victory
As the term draws to a close I
thought I would write a summary
of what has been happening on
the top floor of the Union
Building.
This year we have five teams in
the Central London League:
Team one, although not having
actually won any matches yet in
Division two are improving and
are only just losing each game.
Team list: Wladeh Forysiah,
Geo/ Parsons, David Rhodes
and various Team two members.
Team two, got off to a flying
start, appearing top of Division
four on the last table produced.
This is ai! due to good teamwork
and we ail hope that the results
keep coming in next term.
Team list: Graeme Cant,
Andy Lewry, David Gallagher,
Detlef Kopp and Pong Leung.
Team three are the dark horse
of the group. As the results only
appear on the sheets periodically
their present form is not known.
However from all accounts they
are doing all right so far.
Team listBrian Norminton, L
Sabotinov, Kim Male,NChahal,
Steve Desbruslais.
Team four, having won their first
match of the season 9-0 have
been losing all subsequent
matches by a similar margin.
This state of affairs should
improve though next term now
that the players have gained
some league experience.
Team list: Richard Homan,
Joseph Monkham, Mike
Shewan, Dean Sarson,
Matthew Bridgewater and
Radar Nuwayhid.
Team five, in the words of the
divisional secretary 'Erica's
doing a grand job'! They have put
together some good team
performances and have reaped
the rewards in the form of a
string of good (Many against
teams well above them in the
Division). Their first match next
term should be interesting
however, as they are scheduled
to meet Team four who are
determined to secure their
second victory of the season as
soon as possible.
Team list:Erica Parkes,
Richard Brookfield, Christine
Spears, Gerry NG, D Tilley,
John Tilley, John Davies.
Hopefully there should be
some more regular reports
printed next term as the season
really starts hotting up. So keep a
look out and if you're interested
in playing in a team come up any
Wednesday afternoon. We will
be very pleased to see you. Also
the T T ladder is in operation now
.and is open to all members so
come up and join it if you don't
want the commitment of Team
play but want some competition.
GOLF
Christmas
challenge
Last Wednesday IC golfing
Society held their Christmas 36
hole stableford competition.
Adam would have won if the
weather had had a Zambian
flavour to it. However Dave Long
being over-handicapped at four
was hard pushed to gain a
narrow victory over Jeff Morris.
The other seven players also
achieved memorable perform-
ances although Bill Passmore did
manage a meagre 38 points for
the entire 36 holes, and was
subsequently last. Perhaps he
should worry less about cheque
books and it was suggested that
he return to his skis! Despite this
bad performance by Bill who was
two down with three to play
against the treasurer he did
manage to win thanks to 'Dimwit'
Chris three putting the last two
greens.
Improving weather conditions
in the afternoon did not enable
Huw Jones to improve. In the
gathering dusk the less
competent players finally holed
out as the clubhouse lights
twinkled beyond the 18th green.
An excellent meal was followed
by a concerted attack on the
Sudbury fruit machine and Bill
was once again a loser.
On a more serious note new
members are welcomed and if
there is any interested beginners
maybe able to get subsidised
tuition, otherwise next term
there will be a pairs 'fourball
better ball' competition as well as
friendliers. Finally congratu-
lations go the Captain Phil who
managed to knock a ball onto the
tube line at Park Royal station.
BADMINTON
End of the
road
UAU Ladies Badminton last 16
IC(South East 2) Vs Bradford
(East Midlands 1)
Despite our (near) perfect
performance which enabled us
to get this far, this occasion not a
memorable performance in
terms of both team participation
and success.
Arriving at King's Cross at the
unearthly hour of 9am on
Wednesday, we learnt that two
of our players had, the previous
night, unearthed unsuitable (yet
effective) reasonsjor not playing:
too much work. (This apparently
overlooked the fact that we were
6 hours on BR trainsâ€”allowed
unlimited work).
Hence, the team which left for
Bradford consisted of only four
players: Julie Goodeve, Farida
Katelli, Jane Radford and Susan
Yates. This team faced with the
problem that we had already
conceded three games, and
would have to win five out of the
remaining six to win the match.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y (for us),
Bradford produced a good team,
and we won only three out of the
remaining six games, leaving
Bradford with a six-three win.
Sincere thanks to all those
who have participated in U A U
Badminton Matches (Ladies and
Mens), and our success can only
improve next year!
10-PIN BOWLING
Thrashed
Well, we did it again! The 'crack'
IC bowling squad cracked! Yes,
another 10-0 thrashing by
Southampton Univ. They even
decided to toy with us by hiding
four of their team members.
Actually, the rules say that if a
missing team member does not
run up during the first half of a
game, the team must do without
them. Their missing four just
turned up with virtually seconds
to spare. Dammit, we might have
taken a few points off them!
So, what about the match?
The A-team played below par
and lost. The B-team again had a
closer match and were unlucky
to win a point. A good game from
Gary Koh here. The C team
were beaten. So were the ladies
team. You can't really make up a
team of five ladies when only one
girl has been all term!
As a bonus to all you silly-
prone people, there is a multi-
prize bowling session today. Win
cans of coke, Mars bars etc for
doing just about anything and
have a good chance of winning a
bottle of something rather
alocholic.
HOCKEY
Cup win
IC moved into the second round
of the cup aware that, although,
RCS were undoubtedly the
underdogs, they were not going
to be brushed aside easily. The
oppositons tactics were obvious
from the start, and the use of the
packed defence may well have
worked if Smith and Luffkin
hadn't contrived well to score
two short corners early in the
first half. This forced R C S to
a t t a c k a n d b o t h s i d e s
squandered chances as IC tried
to put the game beyond RCS's
reach. The second half saw IC
dominating the midfield and
pushing up hard in order to
increase their lead. However the
RCS defence held firm with
McGillivary and Parker finding
the sweeper, keeper or
narrowness of the goal difficult to
overcome.
So the game ended with IC
happy with their two-nil victory
but reflecting on the fact that to
progress much further they will
have to start scoring a few more
of the easier chances.
