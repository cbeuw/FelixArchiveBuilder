UFC agrees cuts
Going through
the motions
General U n i o n C o u n c i l
(GUC) the ruling body of the
University of London Union has
passed a motion condemning the
Royal School of Mines Union
(RMSU) for holding Hon Porn
Night. The motion was proposed
by U L U executive and Michael
Newman, a former student at
fmperial College spoke on their
behalf. Ian Bull as ICU President
opposed the motion as it
contradicted I C U policy. After
several minor alterations the
motion was passed by a
substantial majority. The U L U
executive were mandated to
organise and publicise a picket of
Hon Porn Night.
The two motions proposed at
last week's U G M were both
passed. The first concerned
student grants and was proposed
by Mike Young Chairman of IC
SDP Society. This gained a
Grants
climb down
Parents of students in higher
education will not have to pay
tuition fees in the next academic
year following changes in the
government's proposals for
education spending. The changes
are seen as a partial climb-down
for the Education Secretary, Sir
Keith Joseph and they arose
following threats of a major Tory
backbench revolt. Coupled to the
changes will be consideration of a
'radical change in the student
support system' including the
possibilty of a loans system.
The major victim of the
concessions is the Science budget
which will be cut by £9 million to
pay for some of the £21 million
cost of the changes. Of the
remaining£12m needed, £2m will
come from educational research,
adult education and the micro-
electionics programme , and £10
million form the Treasury. It
seems as though funds to support
the College will be reduced but is
is not yet know by how much nor
what effects the cuts will have.

substantial majority and Ian
Bull, I C U President, urged
everyone who had voted for the
motion to send letters to their
MPs.
The second motion on
F r e e d o m of C h o i c e was
proposed by Tim Williams of
R S M U . This sought to alter a
previous motion passed last year.
An amendment was proposed by
Rosemary Dickin to change the
motion to prevent use of I C U
rooms for pornographic events.
Tim Williams spoke against the
amendment which was defeated
by 57 votes.
The main motion was opposed
by Roger Preece who claimed
that pornographic events would
be detrimental to the College in
the eyes of the public. A
procedure motion was put to
vote on the issue and the motion
on Freedom of Choice was
passed by a narrow majority.
(NUS) has described the changes
as a 'half baked withdrawl'
reiterating that at least 180 000
families will have to pay more to
support students and there will
be no guarantee that students will
receive their full parental
contributions. He claims the
changes will only help well off
families.
Mr Ian Bull, I C U President,
welcomed the changes. He hoped
that further concessions could be
obtained after a consistent
campaign of letter writing and
other peaceful protests. He also
intended to ask the Rector to
speak out on behalf of students.
