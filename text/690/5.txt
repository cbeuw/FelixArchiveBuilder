Dear old pig
Dear Sir,
As third year Parasitologists we feel that
we should correct the gross errors which
appeared in T Sheriffs article in last week's
Felix, 'The Bible, the Qur'an, Science and
Pork Chops'.
The correct spelling of the parasite
infection from undercooked meat is Taenia
Solium. The parasite is a Cyclophyllid
Cestode, ie a tapeworm, and is therefore a flat
worm and not a round worm as stated in the
article. The adult worm Taenia solium causes
Taeniosis in man, which is only mildly
pathogenic. A complication of this disease is
Cysticercosis and this can be fatal. The two
forms of the disease are due entirely to low
standards of human hygiene and cannot be
blamed on the dear old pig!
Furthermore, it was stated that Taenia
solium causes a desease called Trichinosis. In
fact, Trichinosis is caused by a Trichurid
Nematode, Trichinella spiralis which is a
round worm. This can also be found in pork
but is easily destroyed by adequate cooking.
We would like to point out that due to
exceptionally high standards of meat
inspection in the U K , these parasites are
extremely rare.
Yours sincerely,
Deborah Bailey, Sally Power, E Bell
C P Careford, Nicholas Renn, Mark Viney

Dear Sir,
I wish to express my thanks to all the
people that helped me when I had my
accident, many thanks also to all the people
that sent get well cards and messages.
I am at last on the mend again.
Merry Xmas and Happy New Year to all.

Maxwell's demon
Dear Sir,
I would like to congratulate M r Nick
Maxwell on his election to the post of Vice
Chairman of Wellsoc. I would also like to
congratulate him in the open-mindedness
that has allowed him, with due consideration,
to accept our case that he was an unsuitable
chairman of the society, and then to step
down from that post.
I wish M r Maxwell's Wellsian magazine all
the success it deserves. It is due out,
hopefully, at the start of next term.
Yours
Dave Clements

Dear Sir,
I would like to draw your reader's attention
to the resurrection (it is Christmas —sorry) of
IC North American Club.
We exist to organize, at the IC level, the
administration, publicity and company for
trips for students to the US and Canada.
These are either of the Camp counselling
type, or the casual work type. In either case,
we can arrange the necessary visas.
Only as a student do you have the time to
see North America from the inside. If
interested please contact me through SCC
letter racks, or through Maths.

Dear L A Zenteno,
Having read your letter in F E L I X 6891 feel
you have made a slight error. The room hire
and deposit was paid by L A C C and not by
LAS. Therefore we cannot give any money
back to L A S .
I hope this information is of use to you.

Rissotto
8oz rice
2 rashers of bacon
2 tomatoes
a large green pepper
1 onion
salt and pepper
4oz mushrooms (optional)
2oz butter
Rinse the rice thoroughly. Pour boiling water over the
tomatoes, leave to cool, then peel. Chop the bacon into
pieces and fry in the butter. Cut the pepper in half and
throw away the seeds and stalk. Slice the onion, pepper,
mushrooms and tomatoes thinly and fry with the bacon.
After five minutes add the rice and stir occasionally for
two minutes. Stir in a pinch of salt and pepper.
Add 13floz water (a half pint glass of water and quarter
glass of water), stir, cover the pan, bring to the boil, turn
the heat down low for eight minutes, then off and leave for
a further eight minutes. Fluff up with a fork and serve.
Hellman's mayonnaise is marvellous with this.
