Imperial Pinkies vs City 2-0
Imperial Greenies vs UL2 0-1
City University mustered all their
courage and actually turned up
this week for what was to be a
very blustery match. The start of
the first race saw the pink team
take command and finish
convincing winners against City.
The second race was equally
one-sided although one of the
City helms was allowed to lead
the way around a very tricky
course while Imperial cruised
home second, third and fourth.
The green team raced UL2 in a
much closer match. The
outcome was finally decided by a
multiboat collision, during which
Aoe smashed up yet another
rudder. UL2 were extremely
lucky to emerge un-scathed from
the melee and scored a very
undeserved victory. Further
racing was attemped, but the
starting officials boat developed
sub-aqua tendances and, as the
former were not equiped with
snorkels, racing was abandoned.
BADMINTON
Individual
U A U Badminton individual
Championships 1984, played at
Nottingham University 23-25
November.
Friday at 5pm saw the arrival
of the squad in Nottingham. The
squad consisted of five Post
Grads (Mike Bradley, Steve
Willis, Chris Gaukroger, Alan
Pither, Janet Folkes) and two
freshers (Susan Yates and Julie
Goodeve). First on the agenda
was a raid on Sainsburys,
followed by reporting in at Nott
Univ Sports Centre for the
singles matches.
In the men's singles, Mike and
Alan were knocked out in their
firstmatch, whilst Steve survived
one round, only to lose to the No
2 seed in the next; who
eventually won the final.
In the ladies singles, Janet lost
her first match as did Julie (to the
No 2 seed), but Susan won one
match, which gave her the
dubious honour of returning for
9am on Saturday when she
promptly lost her second match.
In mixed doubles both Mike
and Susan, and Julie and Chris
had hard fought games — both
pairs eventually losing in three
games. Steve and Janet fared the
best of all — they won three
matches, which enabled them to
reach the quarter finals, where
they finally lost to a pair from
Loughborough.
The mens doubles saw IC's
second appearance in a quarter
final, this time from Steve and
Mike, where they were unlucky
to lose a very close game. Our
other mens doubles pair (Chris
and Alan) got knocked out in
their first match.
Our only entry in the ladies
doubles was Susan and Julie,
and they played some hard
fought games — both pairs
eventually losing in three games.
Steve and Janet fared the best of
all — they won three matches,
which enabled them to reach the
quarter finals, where they finally
lost to a pair from Lough-
borough.
The mens doubles saw IC's
second appearance in a quarter
final, this time form Steve and
Mike, where they were unlucky
to lost a very close game. Our
other mens doubles pair (Chris
and Alan) knockered out in their
first match.
Our only entry in the ladies
doubles was Susan and Julie,
and they played some hard
matches, enabling them to reach
the quarter-finals, where they
lost to No 2 seeds from Warwick.
Altogether our first appear-
ance in the U A U badminton
tournament was well worth while
with three pairs reaching quarter
finals.
VOLLEYBALL
UAU
triumph
IC Mens Volleyball team are on the
way to a repeat of last year's win in
the University Athletic's Union
Championships coming out top in
the South-East regional competition
held at Essex University,
Colchester, last Saturday. After
convincingly beating East Anglia ,
Surrey and Sussex Universities, IC,
as expected, found themselves up
against oldrivalsKent. The first set
of this match resulted in an anti-
climatic 15-2 victory for Imperial —
the very first IC attacking move
showed the way with Pete 'Finger'
Walker setting a beautiful short ball
for Christos to spike down in a
metre inside Kent's attack zone.
The second set was closer, with IC
relaxing a bit, but with hard work
from Steve and Dom on the long
ball, Al blasting everything remotely
like a half ball and Stef pounding the
odd half-behind with glee the result
was a foregone conclusion, the
score 15-11 for us. Unfortunately
Mike didn't have a second chance
to try his new attacking jump-dig as
he was on the subs bench with
yours truly providing moral
support.
Congratulations also to the
Ladies team which played on
Sunday — they won for the first
time ever, a convincing victory over
the girls of Brunei University. We
hope this isjust the beginning, as the
potential and the enthusiam exists
in plenty!
Unfortunately, things started to
go to pieces after that good start
and we lost to Kent and Sussex,
with the digs letting us down a bit —
though some good blocks and
covering helped, and the serving
was marvellous at times, more
communications would have
helped, though this could be difficult
in a team of two Greeks, an Irani, a
German, a Czech, a Scot and the
token minority Englishwoman —
Captain Viv Not to miss out the
Irish coach! Well done all round.
A quick mention for the lads of
the men's second team who
unfortunately lost to Shoreditch last
week. Never mind chaps stiff upper
lips — things can only get better,
keep up the hard work.
HOCKEY
Records
Last Saturday the thirds
encountered the best opposition
so far this season. However
undaunted by this fact we were
determined to set new 3rd XI
records, and we suceeded. The
records created were:-
a Largest squad of the season
(13 players).
b M o s t s h o r t c o r n e r s
conceded in a half (apporox 12 in
first half).
c Least number of shorts
converted into goals (none),
d Longest throw of a hockey
stick, thanks to Mark cubitt.
c Most goals scored by a goalie
(well done Chris Jones),
f Greatest number of goals
scored by opposition (five).
Finally we also managed to
maintain our 100% home record.
SPORTD
LADIES CRICKET
End of
term
For the last six weeks the men's
cricket team has had company in
the nets at Lord's Indoor Cricket
School. A n enthusiastic nucleus
of women cricketers have been
taking advantage of the excellent
coaching facilities in preparation
for six-a-side and eleven-a-side
fixtures in the approaching
season.
There is one more net booked
before the end of term. From
6pm to 7pm on Wednsesday 12
December, but more are
planned for next term as we've
got an i n d o o r six-a-side
tournament to get in shape for.
So if you want to learn the finer
points of our national sport, get
in touch with Kate Gilbert,

A b s o l u t e b e g i n n e r s are
welcome.

Treble
success
IC 4 Weavers 3
IC 4 Lord Palmerston 3
Well, that's three in a row, a
result not seen at IC for the last
two years. In truth the victories
should have been by larger
margins, but victories they were
nonetheless. A g a i n s t the
Weavers Pete was crap (what's
new), Buz and Alan were
probably the best players
although Alan's nine and eleven
somewhat b l e m i s h e d his
performance. Against the
Palmerston Ian (our glorious
leader) was drinking slimeline
BITTER L E M O N , and JAZ, who
was on Penicillin (possibly due to
a nocturnal transgression) drank
O R A N G E S Q U A S H . Both
changed to bitter (what men!)
during the evening, but the initial
impact caused untold conster-
nation amongst our team of
hardened alcoholics. Pete was
surprisingly put in at number two
and played almost compatently
although still scoring a seven and
a five. Ians' sobriety allowed his
best performance of the season
with Buz and Richard playing
well again. The cup eights was
won by a walkover, the cheap
beer causing the opposition to be
too pissed to compete.
