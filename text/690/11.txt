CFEATURE;
Next term, the dullest, most tedious
competition IC Union has to offer will
begin. We are talking, of course, about
the elections for President. While
FELIX Editor and Deputy President
both involve hard work and require real
talent, to get yourself elected President
you need different qualities: egotism,
megalomania and the ability to drink at
great length all help, but most
importantly you need to be able to
encourage everyone to believe that you
are simply the only one for the job.
Last year, smart-arse Ian Bull managed
to pull this con-trick with admirable
skill. Perhaps squiring the then
(female) President, Gaynor Lewis all
year did something to help. However,
this year no such obvious candidate
has appeared. But this does not mean
that the position is open to all takers.
We all know that the average student
has less than a snowball's chance in
hell of becoming President. No, the
post will go to one of the so-called
hacks-people who have spent two,
four or even five years sipping sherry
in the Union Office, sitting on obscure
and largely ineffectual committees and
proposing the odd (but never
controversial) UGM motion. How many
of you have ever done any of these?
Now let's get on and look at some of
the candidates who might become
NEXT YEAR'S
Carl Burgess
Incontinent ex-rag mag
editor, Carl inhabits a strange
world of drunkeness and
delusion. He stood for
President two years ago on a
furry toilet seat platform and
will probably stand again this
year on anything he can find.
He is reported to have
addressed the hustings U G M
in Italian, Greek and sign-
language as well as English,
with the aid of three
simultaneous translators.
Whether this gained him any
minority votes is unclear. As
you may have realised, Carl
can only command the status
of a joke candidate, and such
people rarely win ICU
elections.
Joanna Claydon
During the last year, as
External Affairs Officer,
Joanna has been a constant
reminder that some students
suffer horribly from inflation.
Many, however, consider her
nickname 'Hippo Claybrain'
grossly unfair. It has been
stated in her defence that she
does, after all, have the grace
and dignity of a reversing
elephant. We at FELIX are the
last to be hippocritical. We
don't want to make too much
of her singing Bestiality's Best
at a recent barnight, either.
How else is a hippo to have
some fun?
Mike 'Baldthing' Stuart
As ex-Guilds President and
Welfare Officer, altruistic,
responsible, knowledgeable
and mature enough to accept
his nearly hairless state,
'Baldthing' would be an ideal
candidate were it not for one
thing—he has been recog-
nised as a 'wet', and in ICU
politics, that is fatal.
J Martin Taylor
Without doubt, Boolery
Woolery is the most ably
qualified candidate having sat
on more committees than he's
eaten hot dinners in his fifty
years here to date.
His most noteworthy skill
(apart from his rare wit and
intelligence) is the ability to
talk indefinitely on any
subject. His three major
handicaps are:
1. His funny regional accent
(he hails from Lancashire)
invariably reduces a captive
audience to tears, boredom, a
hypnotic trance, or most
often, to incapacitating
hysteria.
2. His extreme right-wing
views are anathema to most
impoverished students and so
he would be well advised to
keep hisoblong mouth shut as
much as possible.
3. Due to an unfortunate
personality disorder he finds
the recommendation in 2
impossible.
Perhaps these faults were to
blame for his defeat in the
Presidential elections two
years ago. But since then,
Boolery Woolery has had the
highlights put in his hair and
exchanged his glasses for
contact lenses, and thus
disguised, will probably stand
again.
J Martin's new look
Hugh 'Bigbum' Southey
The youngest of the field,
Bigbum is known as the blue-
haired, blond-eyed boy of
FELIX and the buffoon of IC
Radio. He is so energetic and
enthusiastic that he tends to
leap about in conversations.
Although widely regarded as
naive, Bigbum does have
considerable expertise in both
Union Affairs and pub-
lications; in other words a
right pain in the arse!
a Huge cheeky smile
Hugh Greystoke' Stiles
Without doubt the most
shambolic and foot festering*
candidate, and at best a rank
outsider, Greystoke (so called
because of his biannual dress
sense) is nevertheless an
experienced Union Officer.
Despite his shy and retiring
manner, Greystoke is
currently engaged in shit-
stirring in the Chemical
Engineering Department.
(This does not mean that he
ever had anything to do with
Guildshit).
* doesn't change his socks
So there you have it—the best
ICU has to offer. Who will you
vote for?
