It seems the anti-porn campaign
against events at College
involving strippers has not ended
despite the exam failure of its
main driving force, the infamous
Michael Newman. Far from it,
having continually lost votes at
IC U G M s Michael has now taken
his fight out of College. The first
step was his approach to the
national papers last year which
resulted in an article in the Daily
Express, after which he claimed
to have been threatened with
expulsion from the College by the
Rector. Now he has written to
every student union president in
the country to stir up trouble,
resulting in the motion at U L U
G U C last week. However, not all
anti-porn campaigners in College
agree with his tactics. F E L I X
staff were disturbed from their
labours last Wednesday by the
sound of Newperson himself
being verbally savaged by a
member of WIST under Beit
Arch. However, spare your
sympathies since I am able to
report that Michael was able to
give as good as he got!
Now that the Southside fire
alarm system seems to be getting
over its 'teething troubles' the
real reason for the problem has
come to light. The contracters
appointed by the Estates Section
to install the system went
bankrupt before they'd finished
the job! It has not yet been
revealed whether or not the
College paid them, but it is clear
there is no chance of recovering
the considerable costs involved in
ironing out the problems from
the now demised company.
Possibly a shake-up in the old
boy network by which Estates are
said to invite tenders for such
contracts is in order after this
latest debacle.
