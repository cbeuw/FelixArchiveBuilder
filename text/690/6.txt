CREATURE
F E L I X - 3 5 y e a r s
This issue commemorates 35 years of FELIX. Staff member
Grenville Manuel takes a look back at the birth, childhood,
adolescence and maturity of the newspaper of Imperial College
Union.
The need has been felt for some
time for a frequently published
journal to comment upon the
affairs of the College whilst they
are still topical, and to bring to the
attention of its members the
activities of Clubs and Societies
of which people at present know
little, and knowing little care even
less.
Thus began the first paragraph of
the first issue of FELIX,- who was 35
years old on Sunday.
The first issue was primitive by
today's standards, thin and contained
little that would be of relevance to
today's student (rather like
Broadsheet is today). The first editor
was E M Hughes, and it cost 3d.
However, students in 1949 did
share some pursuits with their
modern counterparts. The first
editor tried to emphasise the good
value of FELTX by stating that a
term's subscription cost less than a
pint of beer.
Most of the cover stories in the
early issues are about student arrest
after various pranks: two students
who scaled the Albert Memorial
being fined a whole shilling.
Students in 1950 must have been
relatively prosperous, as Issue
Eleven started a series of road tests
with the Morris Cowley. The
motoring correspondant especially
liked a hand operated klaxon, which
'commanded respect even from the
old ladies of Kensington'.
Some of the early issue did have a
delightful 'Olde Worlde' feel, with
headlines such as 'Rummy Doings at
the University'. One 1950 cover
story concerned the disgraceful
sacking of Mr Sellers , the Union
Dining Hall butler in a cost cutting
exercise. This was roundly attacked,
as Mr Sellers 'provided one of the
differences between Imperial
College and other less august
colleges'.
By 1957 the circulation had risen
from the intial 600 to 1400, and the
quality of production was improving
steadily. A May issue carried a
special rag supplement with stories
of a fake zebra crossing erected by
students which was accepted as
genuine by traffic and pedestrians
alike, and a brawl which had to be
broken up by 'policemen with
waterproof underclothing', though
how this fact was ascertained was
not clear.
By 1961 the price had risen to 4d,
and FELIX was becoming closer to
the superb and vibrant publication it
is today. Headlines included 'You
And Your Grant', 'Union Meeting
Inquorate' and 'Increased Refectory
Charges'. FELIX was being printed
on better quality paper, with
