NETBALL
A wealth
of talent
Imperial Ladies Netball Club
entered U A U for the first time
this year. Two teams were
entered, and they both came
third in the challenge round,
which was a respectable result
considering neither of the teams
had trained together for more
than a couple of training
sessions.
However, since the U A U
fixtures at the beginning of term,
neither team has lost a match!
The squad training is proving to
be very useful, with lots of
sneaky tactics being 'rehearsed'!
During the first team match at
Goldsmiths College last week,
one member of the opposition
told us that they were 'dreading
playng us, because of our good
reputation'! That must go down
in the archives as the quote of the
season — as long as everyone
believes it, and no-one talks to
Brian behind the Union Bar, we'll
be OK!
Goldsmiths were being
hammered by us to such an
extent that they injured one of
our team, (accidentally, of
course), just before half time, but
in the end, we still managed to
draw with only six players.
Congratulations to: Carol, Julia,
Geraldine, Jane B., Debbie, and
Jui, and 'Get Well Soon' to
Melenie , who is still on crutches!
Tomorrow, we have got two
matches at home, with the
following teams.
Team one: Geraldine Archer,
Julia Avery, Sarah Holmes-
Woodhead, Carol Singleton, Jo
Savage, Jane Orford, Debbie
Charlett.
Team Two: seura Bakman, Jin
Georgion, Janet Fakes, Nathalie
Laidler, Angela McLean, Gillian
Langford, Cath Griffeth.
All supporters are welcome,
(at 9am!), and if anyone out there
is a netball referee, please please
contact me, (Sara Holmes-
Woodhead, Physics UG).
A n y o n e else w a n t i n g a
sweatshirt, sign up by this
weekend please — I'll collect
money next term!
WATERPOLO
Repeat
success
IC's first game in the Southern
Region U A U final was against
Southampton. IC scored their
first goal very early on and
proved to be the faster of the two
teams. Southampton never
really showed any cohesion and
College w o n easily. After
huddling for an Ian Spooner
team talk IC next played Surrey.
College scored from a number of
well drilled set moves. Three
Surrey shots unfortunately
whizzed past IC's goalie Dave
'the' Wall. Robert, playing 'man
in the hole', twice turned his
defender to score a couple of
good goals. Tight marking was
needed to contain Surrey and IC
went on to win the game. Against
Bath a practiced 'man up' drill did
not work. This was an ominous
sign for the forthcoming game
against Bristol. Bath however
were dismissed for nothing after
College scored seven times. The
last game against Bristol was the
decisive one. College were
playing in white for the first time
and, out of turn, Bristol scored
first. The game was fast and the
hurried atmosphere meant a few
opportunites were missed IC's
man up drills did not work,
however college did have many
good shots on target. Bristol
though, with the help of their
goalie, won 6-3. Imperial College,
now as the runners up in the
Southern league, go through to a
further semi-final round in
January. The winners of that
round might meet Bristol again in
the final. From the waterpolo
team, 'Happy Christmas'.
