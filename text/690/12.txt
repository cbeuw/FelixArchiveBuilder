Money
Housing Benefits
The most likely way in which you
will be able to get additional
money during the vacation is by
getting a sizable contribution
towards the rent which you pay
during the vacation.
Most students can get housing
benefit during term time if they
pay over £21 per week, exclusive
of heating and lighting. Many of
you are already taking advantage
of this. In order to get more
money during the vacation, all
you have to do is write to the
housing benefit section which
you are already dealing with, tell
them that you are paying rent
over the vacation and that you
want your claim to be re-
assessed. In most cases you will
get around 70% of your rent back
in this way.
If you have not already claimed
then you can either sign on as
unemployed in which case you
will get certificated housing
benefit through the D H S S .
Alternatively you can submit a
claim for standard housing
benefit.
The DHSS option involves
signing on in London as and
when required so it is probably
easiest to go for standard
housing benefit which can all be
done by post.
Supplementary Benefit
If you are not getting a grant you
can sign on for supplementary
benefit so long as you are
unemployed and available for
work. This is worth around £26
per week.
Unemployment Benefit
To be eligible for unemployment
benefit, during the Christmas
vacation you need to have
worked and paid National
Insurance Contributions during
the relevant period. In effect you
need to have earned over £1350
between April 1981 and April
1982 or over £1475 between April
1982 and April 1983.
NB Overseas students, that is
non-EEC students are not
eligible for these benefits.
Furthermore it can cause
serious problems if you try to
claim them.
If you would like to find out more
about any of these benefits and
how to go about claiming them,
please call into Student Services
15 Princes Gardens.
Student Services will be closed
from 17 December to 1 January
inclusive.
