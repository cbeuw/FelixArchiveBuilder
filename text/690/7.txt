;,al. having been with us for two long terms and a few
weeks of this one, finally passed away quietly on May 6th at
Christmas 1973 saw IC students
protesting with 'Grants Campaign in
full Swing' and Mr Mooney
threatening to close the refectories

FELIX carried a spoof article in
which the political correspondent
Vladmir Catnip attempted to smash
the system with the help of 'The
Advisory Centre for Bolshevism'.
The article ended with the not-so-
spoof phrase 'If the graduate
unemployment doesn't get you the
premature redundancies will'.
FELIX maintains its editorial
independence. Large numbers of the
last issues of Steve Marshall's
editorship were stolen in an attempt
at censorship, possibly because of
Issue No. 499 Friday 17th November 1978
THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
the two page article on Freemasonry
it carried, showing masonic
handshakes and making allegations
about College personnel. A second
edition was hastily printed, with the
cartoon cover being replaced with a
story detailing the attempt at
censorship, and the edition was
successfully distributed throughout
the College.
FELIX has moved a long way in 35
years, from a duplicated news-sheet
to a printed newspaper with a
sabbatical editor and the services of
a printer and a typesetter. However,
the principal of 'commenting upon
the affairs of the College whilst they
are topical' still remains, and is the
foundation upon which FELIX is
built.
