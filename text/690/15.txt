Christmas
Diary
Theatre
The Nerd
At the A l d w y c h . Starring
Rowan Atkinson. If you like
the faces and the whimsical
habits of this man, then this is
your chance to have a good
laugh. Guaranteed to let you
know the American definition
of ' N e r d ' . S o m e g r e a t
one.liners as well. (Ring 836
6404)
Little Shop of Horrors
At the Comedy. The Play of
the B-Movie disaster, but this
is no flop. This pastiche about
a naughty plant is now
running well and worth a
watch. (Ring 930 2578)
The Hired Man
At the Astoria. Based on the
novel by Melvyn Bragg. A
braeing, rugged, simple and
utterly exhilerating musical
adaption of Bragg's novel
about life in a rural Cumbria
community during the years
bridged by the Great War. A
highlight of this year. (Ring
734 4287)
Loor
At the Lyric Shaftesbury. By
J o e Orton. This c l a s s i c
funeral parlour farce is still a
hoot. Compulsory viewing!
(Ring 437 3696)
Of Mice and Men
At the Mermaid Theatre.
Adapted from Steinbeck's
moving tale of ranch-hands in
30's California. A show of
carefully tuned sensitivity.
(Ring 236 5568).
Trumpets and Raspberries
At the Phoenix Theatre. With
Grift Rhys Jones and Gwen
Taylor. An entertaining if
diminishingly fruitful farce
about mistaken identity in the
Italian car industry. (Ring 836
8611).
Pump Boys and Dinettes
At the Piccadilly Theatre. With
Kiki Dee and crew. Nothing
profound or challenging here,
even a bit rough, but good
musical entertainment. (Ring
437 4506)

Cinema
Films now showing all over
London
The Killing Fields
It's got to be good if it's British.
Or has it? David Putman's film
about Vietnam, Cambodia etc.
Surely you've heard?
A Private Function
An Alan Bennett script. Piggy
jokes during the late 1940's
when everyone wanted pork
for dinner. Layered onto a
sub-plot of middle class social
warfare. As timid Michael
Palin and wife Maggie Smith
nick a porder ear-marked for
the town's celebration of the
c o m m i n g m a r r i a g e of
Princess Elizabeth.
The Natural
Starring Robert Redford. G o
along and scream or get your
wobby bits tingling. This is a
good, clean filmthatwill make
you want to clap. Redford as
baseball player coming back
to the game in comparitive old
age, but boy can he still hit
that ball. Hara!

H i g h l y r e c o m m e n d e d .
Burton's last role alongside
J o h n Hurt. The greatest
a c h i e v e m e n t is to have
incorporated the impossible
preaching and crazed ideas
into the fabric with hardly any
loose threads.
Bolero
Bo Derek does it again and
again and again and... In
search of a latter day sexual
hero.
Dune
Set to be a real scorcher. A lot
of hype and money has gone
into this. Its about the creation
of a religious leader I think,
and spans at least four
p l a n e t s . S t a r r i n g S t i n g ,
among others.
Visual Art
The Print in Germany 1880-
1930
At the British Museum. A
m a g n i f i c i e n t c o l l e c t i o n ,
including works by Kollwitz,
K i r c h e r , H e c k e l , M a r c ,
Kandinsky, Klee, Beckmann,
Schwitters and Grosz if that
means anything to you. (Ring
636 1555).
Glyn Philpot
At the National Portrait
Gallery. Hype, hype! The
recently rediscovered Philpot
is back in vogue. Completely
convincing. (Ring 930 1552)
Modern Masters from the
Thyssen - Bornemisza
Collection
At the Royal Academy until
Dec 19. A show definetely not
to be m i s s e d , of most
d i s c r i m i n a t i n g taste and
enormous scope. (Ring 734
9052).
Susan Rothenberg and
George Stubbs
At the Tate. Worth a look if you
happen to be down that way.
(Ring 821 1313).
John Deakin
At the V&A. Pure photo-
graphs of well known sitters in
an entirely unpretentious
style. Highly Recommended.
(Ring 589 6371).
Bookshop News
The Bookshop sign on the
wall which leads to Chemical
E n g i n e e r i n g h a s b e e n
b o r r o w e d by p e r s o n or
persons unknown! As these
are rather expensive, I would
appreciate that particular one
back. I wonder if they are the
same people who took the
finger plates off the shop
door?
There is a collection bottle
on the counterforthe Douglas
Bader Foundation. The aim of
the foundation is to create a
much needed sports and
rehabilitation centre where
the limbless will be able to
meet and participate in a
number of activities, so if you
want to get rid of any old
paper money before it goes
out of print, here is an ideal
way.
O n l y t w o w e e k s to
Christmas, don't forget we
have a wide range of general
b o o k s c o v e r i n g m o s t
subjects, stationary items,
Christmas cards and wrap-
ping paper. If in doubt, you
can always give a booktoken
which can be used in any
bookshop.
The Sportshop has T-shirts,
s w e a t s h i r t s , j u m p e r s ,
trainers, s q u a s h rackets,
Speedo tracksuits and various
other sporting requirements.
