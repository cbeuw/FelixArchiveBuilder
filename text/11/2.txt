PROFILEâ€” DEREK COOMBER
Derek came to Imperial College in the far-off
days of 1944, and was soon established as a rowing
man with a vague interest in Physics and a dis-
criminating taste for beer. In this turbulent
period of his youth, when the Union was coming back
to l i f e after the war, he was an early and active
member of the 69 Club. Hone, i t is said, was more
prominent in the party which bore back the stone
lion that now broods over the Union entrance hall.
He rowed in the famous I.C. VIII of 1946, though
mumps kept him from Henley, and he would have been
President of the R.C.S. in the following session but
for the hand of fate and the board of examiners.
Concerning his time in the Army, I.C.'s man of
destiny i s strangely reticent. He i s wont to smile
inscrutably, puff his pipe, and smooth the Coomber-
ian coiffure. Pressed, he w i l l admit modestly the
rapid promotion which carried him to the (local)
rank of unpaid lanoe-corporal, but the rest is
everybody's guess. At least the harsher circum-
stances ofthe military l i f e have had no discernible
effeet on his unlugubrious character.
Returning in 1948, Derek succeeded In con-
founding the academic opposition, getting a Second,
and at the end of the year he moved into that
esoteric region of the R.C.S. devoted to the per-
secution of fundamental particles. At the same
time began his long-delayed presidency of the R.C.S.
(and of the '22 Club) and his o f f i c i a l association
with the irrepressible Dai Nicholas, which now
operates in a wider sphere. In these hands R.C.S.
Union had i t s ramshackle finances marvellously
restored. Moreover i t gained the unique distinc-
tion of a President who i s current shove ha'penny
champion of I.C.
This final pinnacle of success, the culmin-
ation of such a versatile record, can have left few
doubts in the minds of Council when they came to
elect I.C.'s new President. The future will no
doubt present i t s difficulties, (November the f i f t h
approaches), but here one feels i s a man who is un-
likely to lose touch with student opinion, or f a i l
to interpret i t to the remoter seats of power.
Here, freshers, i s one who will listen to you
sympathetically at Union meetings (he has to), and
who w i l l not spurn the proffered glass should you
approach him informally in another place. One who
will be your guide, philosopher and friend in Union
affairs; and one whom you should never partner at
bridge. He i s terrible at i t .

To The Editor of FELIX.
Sir,
City & Guilds College
12 Oct. 1950
I wish to oomplain about our own British Rail-
ways. On Sept. 26,1950 I dispatched from home a
nice big box containing most of my earthly posses-
sions and among other things - my rugger k i t .
Up to Monday, Oct 9 my box had not arrived and
as you can imagine, Iwas getting rather worried.
On Monday, Oct 9, however, a representative of
the B.R. rolled up and proceeded with the delicate
task of unloading a baby carriage..
Now sir, I have never to my knowledge ordered
a pram and to the best of my belief never had cause
to. Furthermore, I am a batchelor and intend to
remain so for some years to come. To add to the
indignity I received a note from Wlllesden Junction
a few days ago stating that:- "On and from 13 Oct
'50, storage charges w i l l accrue at the rate of
1/0| per ton per week " .
Yours faithfully,
P.D.Rich.
P.S. Do you think i t would be possible to motorize
a perambulator?
I.C. Union.
To the Editor of Felix.
Sir,
When I came to this College I read with
satisfaction that the bar was licensed from 12.50
to 2.30 and 5.30 to 11 p.m. Here, I thought, is
a Union with a proper grasp of essentials. Ima-
gine my chagrin, therefore, when I discovered that
the bar was in fact only open from 12.30 to 2 and
6 to 10.30 p.m. I have made a few enquiries and
learn that the hours were curtailed during the war
due to staff shortages, but the war finished 5
years ago and I notice that there are two barmen.
Surely the time has come to rectify this error in
our ways?
Yours etc.,
Thirsty Fresher.
