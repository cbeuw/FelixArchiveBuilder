THE
ROAD TEST - No. 1
1926 MORRIS COWLEY
An inexpensive
car that provides
sound motoring,
fresh air and a
sporting chance of
survival.
General Remarks. The
1926 Morris Cowley Is
a car which w i l l ap-
peal to the more spor-
ting type of owner
rather than the busi-
ness man who wishes to arrive on time at the of-
fice in Immaculate condition. The model tested
has a reasonably good hood that Is easily erected
In half an hour; the side windows are quickly de-
tachable with the aid of a tyre lever, although
they suffer to some extent from a paucity of cel-
luloid. In other respects, the 2 door, 4 seat
body is well designed; the doors are both on the
near side, the front seat Is of the popular bench
type, and - a feature that w i l l appeal to the ner-
vous passenger - the front floor board when pressed
disengages the clutch.
Engine. The 4 cylinder side valve engine i s rated
at 11.9 H.P. and incorporates many new features,
including magneto ignition, reciprocating pistons
and a 3-bearlng fully-rotating crankshaft. It
starts easily on the handle and is light enough
for lady passengers to turn over without distress.
Electrical Equipment. The starter motor and dynamo
are combined i n a Lucas Dynamotor, and i t is be-
lieved that It would start the engine i f i t was
connected up. (Do not use redundant prepositions
- B.J.P.) In other respects, the electrical sys-
tem i s pleasantly free from shocks. The position
of the ignition switch m a k e 3 no difference to the
running of the engine, a feature that should ap-
peal to women drivers.
Chassis. The steering at low speeds is a t r i f l e
heavy, but at normal cruising speeds i t is light
and stable, enabling one to drive for satisfactory
periods with both hands otherwise engaged. (The
model tested is rapidly learning i t s own way home
from the Prospect of Whitby). The suspension i s
a l i t t l e hard by modern standards but bouncy types
should be amply satisfied; the name "Springless
Wonder" is not wholly justified.
The brakes stop the car quite nicely, but a
l i t t l e patience i s required.
Accessories. The auxiliary equipment Is compre-
hensive. Tools are kept in a box on the running
board, under the rear floor and under the rear
seat. The portable welding plant, however, has to
be tied on the back. The 12 volt battery is car-
ried on the near-side running board, and the spare
wheel was carried on the off-side until some clot
stood on i t ; i t i s now carried on the rear seat.
An effective, albeit toxic, form of heating i s
provided by air from the engine having free access
to the front compartment.
Probably the most pleasing auxiliary is the
manually operated klaxon, a truly magnificent de-
vice that commands respect even from the old ladies
of Kensington.
