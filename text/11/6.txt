THE SABIN TANKARD
From our Rowing correspondent.
The Autumn Tideway Clinker Eights, organised
by the Vesta Rowing Club, for the Sabin Challenge
Tankard, will be rowed off on Saturday, 21st. October]
The race, which is rowed in a clinker built boat is
for junior oarsmen, i.e., those who have never won
a race. The I.C.B.C. have always entered a strong
crew for this event and on Saturday, will be defend-
ing the trophy which they have won for the last two
years. The date being so close to the beginning
of term means that the crew has had l i t t l e opportun-
ity to train and "get together". Nevertheless, they
are a keen and enthusiastic bunch and should giye
a good account of themselves.
The crew is as follows:-
D.J.Gardner (bow); D.G.Brook; G.Benson;
P.E.T.Baylis; A.Caffarey; C.B.Stevens; P.Osborne;
H.Metcalfe (stroke); D.H.W.Thomas (cox).
"Have a Rood row chaps".
HOCKEY
On the occasion of the first t r i a l , i t was
only too evident that the summer vacation had ta-
ken a heavy t o l l on stamina. However, after this
loosener (or stiffeneri), play at the second t r i a l
showed an astonishing Improvement.
Freshers who caught the eye were J. Bennett,
fullback (who has captained Christ's College, Cam-
bridge), J. Power, a forward of great promise, and
D. Waterland (from U.C. Cardiff), who showed con-
siderable speed on the right wing.
A substantial proportion of last year's t r i -
umphant sides have escaped the examiners' plough
and Peter Justesen should lead the club in yet
another successful season. Competition for team
places will be very keen; four teams will be i n
the field for the first time in the history of the
SOCCER
The trials at Harlington sho.ved a considerable
improvement in the general standard of play; this,
combined with the record number of 80 playing m
e
m
-
bers,- suggests that the prospects for the soccer
season are extremely good.
It is hoped to f i e l d 5 XI1
s, the 2nd. and 3rd.
XI's having been entered for the University league.
For the f i r s t time in the history of the club
matches will be played on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
This will of course entail extra work for the
club officials, but as there are two extra pitches
available the position has been greatly eased.
RUGGER
Two facts have emerged from the rugger t r i a l s .
Firstly, that there i s talent amongst many of the
freshers. Secondly, that of those freshers who
signed the t r i a l s l i s t only f i f t y per cent turned
up to play. That, to say the least, does not help
to build club s p i r i t .
From the V.L. t r i a l s came word of one Higkin
of Guilds v/ho was claimed to be the best fly-half
the University had seen for some years, but his
triumph was short-lived for he was returned to Rut-
l i s h School after a fortnight at I.C., to do Inter-
mediate Chemistry. "Brown-bagging" at high level!!
Be that as i t may, one ray of hope remains. Four
I.C. teams returned victorious from their f i r s t
games of the season, so perhaps, after a l l , the
selectors were not quite so blind as they appeared.
