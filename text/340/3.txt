Hello and welcome to Imperial College, doyen of
the technological institutes. Y o u are not alone i n con>
ing fresh to I C for we have a new rector: S i r B r i a n
Flowers, following the retirement of L o r d Penney this
year.
Imperial College was formed by one of the earliest
tripartite 'agreements when the R o y a l College of
Science, City and Guilds Institute and R o y a l School o f
Mines decided that as they all cohabited the same patch
of bog i n prehistoric South Kensington they might as
well merge and pool their facilities.
The inter-collegiate wars that occurred as a result of
that amalgamation have since subsided and are now-
adays mainly fought on the battlegrounds — sorry,
sports pitches — at Harlingiton, and i n the pinching of
violate mascots.
Such constituent college chauvinism c a n have very
constructive results, e.g. monster R A G collections, a n d
the occasional lapse if it impinges on federal bodies
like I C U .
Freshers' week is under w a y now i n tjhe U n i o n
building and is the only chance you'll have of getting
free membership to clubs and societies. W e have over
eighty here at I C which cover a l l possible interests,
however deviant. So do join and remember I C doesn't
aim at producing academic automatons, o r i t wouldn't
grant so much money for ithe social and political sides
of student life.
Although the inequality of ithe sexes at I C can pro-
duce problems for both sides, there is a lot of social
liaison with the numerous women's colleges i n the area
and helps ameliorate the situation.
A n y w a y these should be three of the most interesting
years of your life and when you w i l l have the chance
to get involved in more varied pursuits than at a n y
other time. So, there it is, go ahead and above all, enjoy
yourself.
Tf you feel like writing any impressions y o u have of
your first few days at IC, comments, criticisms o r what-
ever, then please address them to the Editor, Felix and
pop i t into the Felix pigeon'hole i n the outer. U n i o n
office.
M a n y thanks — A l i .
