& NEWS P A G E S . . .
On the Sunday before publication the
sports, features, letters and editorial pages
are returned i n proof form. This is when
we realise what a mess we made of the
initial layout and articles are again ex-
panded o r cut to get them to fit.
A t about four o'clock on Sunday when
this stage is finally completed the work
starts o n the news pages. T h e editorial
staff can be again seen scratching their
greying heads and asking what happened
during the week that is interesting and
printable. A t the same time as this is hap-
pening, the photographic editor is busily
trying to transform the vertical pictures
to fit horizontal spaces and vice-versa.
The final pages then begin to shape up
by a process not dissimilar to that of the
first pages. O n e member of the staff is
then detailed to entertain the printers'
representative, our great friend M r .
Milsom, while this process is completed
With great haste. H e then transports the
pages to the printers who bring these ten
days' work to harsh reality.
The photos below show various views of
the printing machines which produce
F E L I X , T h e process is described i n the
captions below the photos.
The photo below shows in greater detail the
process of setting up the type, photos and adverts
in the frames ready for printing. Each frame con-
tains two pages so i n fact- this whole article has
been set i n a frame as shown below. T h e person in
the picture c a n be seen setting the clamps con-
tained in the actual frame which hold the material
firmly in position during printing.
When the pages have been
printed they have to be col-
lated together to form the
newspaper. T h e photograph
below shows the folding
machine used to fold the
double pages in half, under
the watchful eye of the
operative.
The photo on the right is
a general view of the work-
shop where the type is set.
The news pages thus follow
the same process as the ear-
lier pages but are not return-
ed for proof reading because
of lack of time, instead they
are checked for any obvious
errors at Bailey's. Greater
care is therefore needed ove9
the last pages to try and
ensure they fit the available
space.
The picture below shows
the exterior of the printing
works of F. Bailey and S o n
at Dursley in Gloucestershire.
The two thousand copies of
F E L I X are finally completed
before publication and trans-
ported to London,
by Bailey's on the M o n d a y
