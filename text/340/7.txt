RACKETS AND REAL
TENNIS
W o u l d any undergradu-
ate, postgraduate or staff
member of the C o l -
lege who is interested
in playing (or i n learning
to play) either Rackets or
Real Tennis please con-
tact Professor J . R. A .
Pearson, Department of
Chemical Engineering and
Chemical Technology (in-
ternal ext. 3801) b y F r i -
day, 12th October.
Those already familiar
with these incomparable
court names should need
no further encouragement.
However, many enthusias-
tic games players may be
unaware of their charm
and of the facilities avail-
able for playing them at
Queen's C l u b (near Bar-
on's Court tube station).
Those of us who have
savoured their delights
would welcome an oppor-
tunity to establish a cor-
pus of players i n the C o l -
lege and to make arrange-
ments to play When con-
venient.

Spiterstulen w e r e along
a narrow dirt track that

the w a y in bottom gear,
owing to the large n u m -
