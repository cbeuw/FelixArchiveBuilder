E FROM LINM
Dear All,
I would just like to thank everyone who contri-
buted to my Leaving/Wedding present last ses-
sion. At the Union Council Dinner and Dance I
was presented with a cheque and an inscribed
pewter tankard. No better present could have been
given me than a tankard, as it really symbolises
Imperial College Union, doesn't it? However, it
will be well used, I can promise!
I'd like to wish the Union every success for the
future, I'm sure that under the guidance of Norm,
Paul and Dave things will look up again!
Goodbye.

Union Clerk)

Weil, here we are again
at the start of yet another
academic year. For some
of you this is the begin-
ning of a new phase as
either an undergraduate
or as a postgraduate. F o r
most of you it is merely
the beginning of another
yjar in your University
career. I would like to
take this opportunity of
welcoming each and every
one of you into the U n i o n
for the coming year, and
hope that we get on well
together.
I "raw*- •-*wfsm*xtm^m
For me, this year is a
completely new experience
in that 1 am in the H O T
seat both for and with the
Union. I have never been
in a situation like this
bei'ore, and so all the help
or ideas which you can
give will be most appre-
ciated.
One thing which should
be made clear at ithe be-
ginning of this year, is that
the Union meetings should
take the form of a F o r u m
in which anyone can
speak. What makes these
meetings so boring is
When the same people
speak on every motion,
and thus one satisfactory
conclusion ito the bore-
dom problem is to speak
when you have something
to say. It doesn't take
much to stand up and say
what you think. If you
honestly don% have the
nerve to Stand up then
please come ito the U n i o n
office before the meeting
and put forward your
views to one of us in here
and we will try to put for-
ward your point of view.
The first tasks which
Will beset the Union this
year are the election of
certain union officers. We
also have to elect a group
of people ito represent the
Union at the November
N.U.S. conference. A l -
though these elections may
seem boring, it is essen-
tial that we have a repre-
sentative vote at the meet-
ing so that those persons
elected really do represent
you.
The larger issues which
we will face this year are
again those of the A c c o m -
modation crisis and also
the Grants situation. A l l
freshmen should have-* re-
ceived i n their mail from
the college a sheet outlin-
ing the grants situation as
it stands alt present. Dur-
ing the U n i o n meetings
this term we will be dis-
cussing our position in the
fight for better grants for
all, with special reference
to area action at the end
of October, and the cor-
rect forms of action for the
rest of the year.
The problem of accom-
modation is a very com-
plex one in the area
around College, and poses
gigantic financial prob-
lems for both the U n i o n
and also the College. M o r e
about this problem will be
seen in future editions of
F E L I X , as we get more
information on the prob-
lem. B y the way, if any-
one either knows of some-
one, or is in possession of
about £2 million wh'ioh is
not being used for any-
thing, then please see me
as soon as possible as this
is the sum required to
build the new hall of resi-
dence on top of the sports
centre ! ! ! ! ! !
Have a good year, and
please feel free at all times
to come into the U n i o n
office for a talk about any
problems which you have
—either your own, or the
Union's.
Looking forward to
seeing you, that's me be-
low!
Norm.
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e P u b l i c a t i o n s
All ICU publications are under the aegis and
sanction of the Publications Board. They fall
objectively into two categories: regular and
irregular.
Felix and the R C S Broadsheet appear weekly
and fortnightly respectively. The former needs no
further mention as you're reading it now. The
R C S Broadsheet is produced in the R C S U office
(opposite the Southside refectory entrance) and
costs a penny. It has been the subject of many
threatened libel suits but through a liberal dosage
of Tartan to the suitors remains as yet unlitigated.
This year it is in the hands of editor Digby L.
James. It is rumoured that another edition of
Pentsheet, the infamous cornucopia of naughty
bits that appeared last term, will not be attempted
this year as the entire stock was stolen before it
could be sold last time.
The irregular publications are Guildsheet
(once/twice a term) and Minesletter (defunct).
The former is filled with ribald stories, articles and
poems and occasional political comment (see the
Moscow Trials issue) as well of course as flow-
ing tributes lauding the successes of Guilds
sportsteams. Only those geriatric few doing re-
search or deferred honours can remember the last
appearance of Minesletter but rumour has it that
it was even more blue in content and politics than
Guildsheet.
There is one other student publication at IC :
CEFE. Produced weekly by Socsoc it contains
political commentary and analysis from the various
groups that attend Socsoc meetings. Last term
it sprang to fame when it published the name of
the third minister involved in the Lambton/
Jellicoe affair when everyone tried to disown it,
fearing a libel suit. However nothing happened
and since the Young Liberals published a similar
expose and didn't get sued it seems that nothing
will. .
Other publications that find their way into 10
are "Sennet" the University of London Union
newspaper which appears fortnightly, and
"Magnus" the NUS glossy which will actually pay
you for articles.
Not to be forgotten are the University of Lon-
don Bulletin published primarily for staff, and our
own IC News which appears weekly and is difficult
to read owing to its texture of intricately folded
sheet metal. However both of these will keep you
up to date with what's going on in the lofty circles
of the non-student University areas.
Produced once a year (at present), and in the;
distant past the only publication at IC, is the
Phoenix. Primarily a literary magazine it prints
stories, poems, drawings, photographs and com-
mentary and welcomes any contributions from all
students. Last year's Phoenix was somewhat de-
layed in going to press but should be out in th£
beginning of this term.
So then, with all that to occupy your sleepless
nights as well as the occasional flurry of bumprt
sheets, you will soon discover that not being able
to read and write is no excuse for doing science!
HON. SEC'S BIT
Welcome to Imperial College. I would like
to spend time explaining all the virtues and
the ins and outs of various aspects of college
life but there are numerous other publications
in which this is adequately done and there is
enough business in this column this week
without this extra burden.
BOMBS
I would like to give a timely warning.
Already during the vacation, the college has
been the victim of a bomb hoax. The next
one, however, may not be a hoax. A l l students
are asked to keep a look-out for any sus-
picious parcels, boxes, bags, etc. If you have
any doubts as to its contents then don't touch.
Warn the people in the immediate area and
contact College Security/Fire Officer on in-
ternal 2741. D o not under any circumstances
tamper with the parcel yourself.
Make sure that you are acquainted with the
college alarm systems. They are here for your
benefit. Please take notice of them.
L E G A L AID
The Union has telephone access to a quali-
fied solicitor. If you have any legal problems,
e.g. accommodation, drugs, motor accidents,
etc., contact me in the U n i o n office and I will
put you in touch with him.
C O M M E M O R A T I O N D A Y
This annual event takes place on Thursday,
October 25th. A l l members of the college are
invited and admission to the degree ceremony
at the Royal Albert Hall and the following
tea is free. Note: to get the free tea you are
expected to attend the ceremony! In the even-
ing the Commemoration Day Ball is held. F o r
the second year running this will take place
in College Block. The price is £5.50 a double
ticket and this includes a five course meal
with sherry, dinner wines and port. Also pro-
vided is a late bar (approx. 2 the next morn-
ing), a dance band, cabaret and discotheque.
This is the first formal event of the year and is
an excellent introduction to this aspect of
college life. Tickets are limited and last year it
was a complete sell-out well in advance, so get
your tickets early. They are available from
Jen (Union Clerk) in the Union office.
U.G.M.
As you will soon find out, these happen at
frequent intervals throughout the year. They
are supposedly the most important meetings
within the Union. Through these, elections are
held, policy decided and numerous debates
held. For the sake of the U n i o n it is import-
ant that you attend all U . G . M s . The first one
will be held this Thursday, October 4th in the
Great Hall, College Block at 1.00. A m o n g the
items to be discussed are entertainments,
Chile, S. Africa, Grants Campaign, as well as
elections for numerous posts. Before you
come, however, please read carefully the
standing orders for Union Meetings which
will be found on page 45 of the Union Blue
Book.
U N I O N D I R E C T O R Y
This year there will be a U n i o n Directory,
To be of most use it is necessary for this to be
published as soon into term as possible. This
is an urgent plea for information. A l l clubs,
societies, bodies and anyone who has reason
to believe he/she should be included in this
directory are asked to send me information as
to their name, address, telephone no., etc. If
possible I would like this information before
October 10th.
P A R K I N G
Parking space at Imperial College is limited
and because of this it is the policy of the
Union to choose the applicants on the merit
of each application. Parking application forms
are available from the U n i o n office and these
should be filled in and completed on or before
Friday, 5th October. O n the 6th and 7th at
October the U n i o n parking committee will
meet and consider the applications and a list
of successful people should be published in the
Felix edition of Tuesday, 9th October with
details of how to obtain the permits.
There are areas within the college precincts
specifically allocated for- motor-cyclists. In
particular these include an area to the south
of Linstead Hall, west of the P.O. in Imperial
Institute Road and behind the Physics build-
ing. Motor-cyclists are asked to keep to the
marked areas and to refrain from parking be-
tween cars.
REGISTRATION C A R D
On the back of your yellow registration
card you will find two sets of boxes. At the
bottom there are seven numbered 1—7, These
are crossed off when you vote in college elec-
tions. A t the top there are 15 boxes lettered
A — P . These are crossed off when you buy
discount tickets for the large I.C. Ents con-
certs held in the Great Hall.
