AH refectory prices are to be increased by
5% over last term advise the Board of Gov-
erners in their meeting on June 29th.
Realising the huge debt been eaten away by inflat-
that was mounting up on
the catering side of the
refectory services, the
Refectory Committee had
drawn up for its meeting
of 21st M a y a series of
five proposals for stopping
the loss. These suggested
price increases of between
zero and 7| per cent.
These increases have
been necessitated, from
the College point of view,
because of the soaring
cost of food i n the last
year which shows little
signs of abatement i n the
coming term.
Although hardly a sur-
prise this news must come
as a shock to many stud-
ents despite the extra £40
for the year just started,
which some claim has
ion already.
there is no motion u p
before the U G M on this
question at the time of
going to press (a week
ago) and President N o r m
Sayles said, "It's difficult
to know what else we can
do apart from accept the
increase."
The increase advised by
the B o a r d of Governors
could have been more if
£6,000 hadn't been taken
from two 'emergency'
funds to help cover the
costs of replacements and
repairs.
The President will be
checking over the recom-
mended new prices to en-
sure that the 5 per cent
rise is not surpassed.
Free Books!
Free Records!
Free Films!
Free Plays!
Free books, records, theatre and film tickets are
Y O U R S for the asking from the F E L I X office. Every
week we get bombarded with free objects and services
from Sir Oswald Moseley's autobiography " M y L i f e "
to L e o n Trotsky's autobiography also called " M y Life",
and from tickets to communal grope sessions at the
Camden Town Revolutionary People's Almost Free
Theatre to Godspell.
The choice is yours: free literature, music or enter-
tainment or, of course, any combination thereof. In
fact even as I sit here and write this, the mid-day post-
man has just brought a range of Fonitana books and
Polydor records.
A h a h ! Cynical student, I know what's going through
your head, you're asking what's the catch? Well, to give
you a clue let me draw your attention to a few more
vacancies on the F E L I X staff:—
Book reviewer(s) F i l m eritlc(s)
Record reviewer(s) Theatre critic(s)
A n d that's a l l y o u have to do! Just churn out a bit
of spiel, or write a highly sensitive review embodying
all your artistic experience of the infrastructure of the
medium. W e couldn't possibly review everything we get
without a 12 page daily paper, but as long as some-
thing gets reviewed occasionally they will keep on send-
ing!
So call i n the F E L I X office during the Freshers'
Fair or anytime and let us load y o u up with gratuit
goodies.
NUS Conference
Motions due in by
October 5th
The National U n i o n of
Students is holding the
next of its twice yearly
conferences at the be-
ginning of December
this year. T h i s Confer-
ence will decide policy
of N U S on basic issues
for the rest of this year.
Imperial College U n i o n
will be sending a dele-
gation to this conference
to represent your views
and w e are also entitled
to send in up to s i x mot-
ions to be put on the
agenda for the confer-
ence. M o t i o n s m a y be
sent in on any subject
though only those o n
subjects of a fairly gen-
eral interest stand a
chance of being debat-
ed. Subjects debated at
recent conferences i n -
clude grants, student re-
presentation, housing,
union autonomy, enter-
tainments, gay rights.
A s y o u probably know,
grants is at the moment
a priority of the National
Union a n d will almost
certainly be debated
again in December.
M o t i o n s submitted
by individual unions,
known as Constituent
Organisations, have to
reach N U S Headquarters
by Friday, October 5 t h ,
thus a final decision has
to be taken on the views
Imperial College U n i o n
wants to put to N U S at
the Union General Meet-
ing on Thursday, Octo-
ber 4 t h . A n y member of
ICU is entitled to put
forward a motion to be
debated at this U G M —
in this case the text of
motions s h o u l d reach
Paul W a d s w o r t h in the
U n i o n Office as soon as
possible. However, there
w i l l also be an open
meeting of the External
Affairs Committee (since
the Committee has not
yet been elected) on
W e d n e s d a y , 3 r d Octo-
ber.
ber at w h i c h all stu-
dents are invited to put
their ideas a n d try to ar-
rive at some motions to
be submitted to the
U G M . T h i s is designed
to save time at the U n -
ion Meeting.
Last year it proved a l -
most impossible to have
m u c h d i s c u s s i o n on
these motions at a union
meeting, m u c h business
was done in lengthy
committee meetings a n d
the final policy w a s hard-
ly known let alone ap-
proved of by the majori-
ty of students. T h i s time
we hope procedure c a n
be more democratic but
it w o u l d help both us
and N U S if motions are
kept fairly short a n d if
the texts come in as
soon as possible. There
w i l l be further stages at
w h i c h w e c a n put our
views to N U S , such as
the amendments to mot-
ions stage later on in the
term about w h i c h I shall
keep y o u informed. If
you want your union to
represent y o u , y o u must
actively take part in
forming its p o l i c y . Fur-
ther information is avail-
able at the meeting o n
W e d n e s d a y of from my-
self c/o the U n i o n
Office.

IC/US COMPUTER
LINK
, A plan to link the computer research de-
partment of British universities with the
A R P A network in the United States which in-
corporates the computing facilities of a large
number of research centres and universities
there has been put into operation.
"We should be linked
up by the end of the
week," said Mr. Marovac
of the Elec Eng depart-
ment here at IC. He went
on to say that the link
with A R P A should mean
advantages for both sides
as computer night time
can be used by the other
hemisphere.
It is hoped to form fur-
ther links with other Eur-
opean countries later on,
and to increase the num-
ber of terminals in Brit-
ain to 24.
He said that there was
not much likelihood of a
terminal for general use
but consideration will be
given to projects especial-
ly if they involve langu-
ages or programmes not
available in this country.
The project, jointly
sponsored by the Institute
of Computer Sciences, the
National Physical Labo-
ratory and the Post Office,
is being led by Professor
Peter Kirstein of the In-
stitute's computer systems
and programming depart-
ment.
Already research groups
from Cambride, Heriot
Watt, Essex, D u r h a m and
some L o n d o n colleges i n -
cluding I.C. have expres-
sed interest in the scheme.
The link is from the
S R C ' s 360/195 computer
at the Rutherford Labor-
atory v i a Norway to the
A R P A network i n the
U.S. F o r the first year the
link to Norway is being
paid for by the Post Office,
but later on it is hoped
the finance will come from
the universities.
This link may give ac-
cess to far larger storage
facilities than are at pre-
sent available in this
country, T o r example the
1 L E A C 4 computer, part
of the A R P A network,
can store u p to 100 times-
the amount of bits of i n -
formation as can the
360/195.
CAYSOC
bumph sent from N U S
has been about gayness.
So if anyone wants to
find out about how to
run a gaysoc or gaydiscos
or read up about gay-
rights or where y o u can
buy or produce gaymags,
then contact Dave Sin-
clair, Deputy President
I C U , who has it all at his
fingertips.
IC/NERC
Professor A l a n Skemp-
ton, professor of civil en-
gineering at Imperial C o l -
lege has been appointed to
the National Environment
Research Council. H e will
take up office immediate-

The lavatory/shower/

the first floor of newly
integrated Beit H a l l ,

of their identity.
The doors of the loos
each have a w o r d a n d
a neatly nailed cartoon
figure of a m a n or a
w o m a n o n them. H o w -
ever due to a technical
oversight, or an impish
sense of humour, the fe-
male diagram is stuck
over the w o r d M E N a n d
vice versa.
Still incinerators ap-
art, no doubt they w i l l
soon settle d o w n to be
used by both sexes like
they always were.
