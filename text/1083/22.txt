Pride cometh before a swim
Some of the finest swimmers ever to
grace Imperial College are set to
break the national BT swimathon
time this week. The team of 5 have
to swim under an hour for 5km
(which means averaging a gruelling
lmin 12secs per 100 metres). Coach
Norman Jones is confident the team
will rise to the occasion and outper-
form any previous teams.
The team is also hoping to raise
some sponsorship to be added to the
BT swimathon good causes, for
more information contact Norman
Jones (Sports centre) or Andrew
Westhead a.westhead@ic.ac.uk.
ACC shows its true colours
After there being talk of one for the
past few years, we finally managed
to pull it off - an A C C colours din-
ner. Kicking off at 7.30pm in the
union dining hall, there was a distinct
lack of medieval fancy-dress, but I
think that anyone actually contem-
plating it was probably relieved
when they hadn't gone ahead with it.
With the quasi-medieval style food
and excessive amounts of wine going
down nice and easy leading to the
main event - the colours presenta-
tion. The colours are awarded as fol-
lows (bearing in mind that anyone
receiving colours of any kind had to
down a pint):
Full colours - for those of U L U
standard or higher but who are still
committed to their IC team.
Half colours - for those competing
at a high standard in their team.
Social colours - for members who
have put a lot of effort into their club
throughout the year.
This year two new awards were
introduced by the union which were
named Sports Person and Sports
Personality of the year.
Congratulations to everybody who
received colours. It was an excellent
night and I hope it will become a
perennial event. Thanks go to the
union staff.

Karate kids kick arse
14 people from the University of
London (ULU) Karate Club attended
the KUGB student Championships
in Chesterfield. The event is popular
and attracts many students. This is
the one that people fear! Physically
demanding and very tough, months
of intensive training went into this.
We were quite confident in our

London team fighters (Tony,
Godwin, Edwin, Rami and Lewis) all
got of to good starts. Hughes was one
of the favourites having come third
in the Shotokan Cup two months
ago. He'd to beaten two England
fighters to get there. Rami (UCH) is

small but quick, agile with plenty of
stamina. Godwin is bigger and more
powerful with deft timing and reflex-

few hundred pounds to finance just
one team out for the 6th-8th

RSM buried in RCS landslide
After last weeks performance all did
not bode well for RCS in this year's
Spark's Cup. But an almost embar-
rassing defeat dealt out to the boyz
last week was all the incentive they
needed when taking on the old
enemy, RSM. This match was what
the whole season had been targetted
towards..
RCS's overwhelming forward
superiority was evident from the
whistle, allowing the backs to run
rampant. Straight form the kick-off
Darren Bryce took the game to the
opposition. He fended off three tack-
les and beat their winger and fullback
in a sprint for the coiner. Just before
half-time, Captain Courageous Karl
Stand executed a cunning grubber
kick which he followed up, collected
and grounded under the posts.
Justin "15 stone" Lee showed
awesome momentum before diving
over the line. An immense dicking
display resulted in Justin converting
all but one of the tries, including two
from the far right touchline.
The other scorers are too numer-
ous to mention but credit goes to our
entire squad for turning up. If R S M
had managed to field anything
resembling a full team, then perhaps
there would have been a slightly
more even contest. But maybe not.
