What are you doing on 1st
May?
With the General Election just weeks away Felix has
gathered together a host of politicians to lay out their
stalls and describe why they are worth voting for. We
chose the candidates for the 'Cities of London and
Westminster', an area which covers Prince's Gardens,
Bayswater, Knightsbridge and Buckingham Palace.
We questioned them on issues such as the privatisation of London
Underground, their views on the need for a strategic authority for the
capital, and other constitutional matters. However space has not
allowed for their wisdom on these matters to be displayed. Overleaf
is a brief synopsis of their background, their views on tertiary educa-
tion, its funding, and how they see the local constituency situation.
If for some strange reason you would like to see the full extent of
their outpourings, then the full 11,000 word epic is available from the
Felix office. Otherwise you can read the condensed versions and
make up your own mind, or just rely on your own preconceptions.
How to m a k e sure that you get your vote
The easiest way to find your relevant constituency is to use
Onlinemagic's 1997 General Election website and their
'Constituency' section. Using your postal code you will be informed
of your constituency, the three main party candidates and the relevant
Borough. Remember to use the place where you were on 10 October
1996, as this is the address which is used for electoral purposes.
The next stage is, knowing your relevant Council, to find a local
library and check to see whether your name is on the electoral regis-
ter, or alternatively to make a grovelling phone call to the Council. If
your name is on their list then you're fine, but if it is not there then you
need a Claim Form, which can be obtained from your local Council,
some of whose numbers are listed below.

What happened last time and what's going to happen this time?
While the 1992 General Election was run with
very different constituencies to those that are being
used this time round, their results are presented
here for comparative purposes. The main change
is that the 'Kensington' constituency has been bro-
ken up, the majority of which has been added to
Sir Nicholas Scott's old 'Chelsea' seat to become
'Kensington and Chelsea'. The remainder, five
northern wards which had predominantly sup-
ported Labour, is being added to the majority of
the old 'Westminster North' constituency to
become the new 'Regents Park and Kensington
North' seat. The final change is that the Bayswater
and Lancaster Gate wards, both Conservative
minded areas, have been added to Sir Peter
Brooke's old seat to become the new 'Cities of
London and Westminster' constituency.
The above changes mean that Alan Clark
should have little trouble winning the new
'Kensington and Chelsea' constituency for the
Conservatives. Considering the votes cast in the
last General Election his party has a 51.5% major-
ity over the Labour Party's contender, Robert
Atkinson. Robert Woodthorpe Browne from the
Liberal Democrats is also contesting the seat.
Sir Peter should have an equally easy ride in the
new 'Cities of London and Westminster' seat as
the redrawn boundaries give him a spectacular
35.2% lead over Labour. Michael Dumigan is
contesting the constituency for the Liberal
Democrats, Sir Alan Walters for the Referendum
Party and Kate Green for the Labour Party.
Regent's Park and Kensington North is very dif-
ferent since using the 1992 votes Labour have a
'notional majority' of 7.3% over the Conserva-
tives in this newly created seat. In Brentford and
Isleworth, which includes Clayponds, the high
profile Conservative MP, Nirj Deva has a major-
ity of 2.8% over Labour. Their candidate is Ms
Ann Keen, while the Liberal Democrats are
putting up Gareth Hartwell and the Green Party
is fielding John Bradley.
The situation in other areas can be found by
