Extra sabbatical post urged for ICU
JITEN PATEL
At Tuesday's Student Representative
Council meeting, a ground-breaking
motion put forward by Sarah
Corneille, Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies), requested the creation
of a fifth sabbatical post.
In the proposal, the post was given
the nominal title "Deputy President
(Student Affairs)" The responsibili-
ties outlined for the new sabbatical
include the setting up and manage-
ment of an effective Academic
Affairs Officer and Department
Representative system, improving
communication between the student
body and the Union, and co-ordinat-
ing welfare issues.
The proposal was put forward in
response to various problems
encountered by the current sabbati-
cals in their work this year. One of
the main issues raised by Ms
Corneille was the amount of time
officers spend "pushing paper", cut-
ting into the time they have to spend
on actual planning, discussion and
action.
Ms Corneille also stressed that the
current sabbatical officers all have
specific areas of concern and so have
little overview of the student body as
a whole. One of the new sabbatical's
duties would be to liaise between
students and the Union, encouraging
feedback and allowing IC students to
become more involved with the run-
ning of their Union.
As ever, planning for the imminent
medical merger is a growing concern
for Union officers. The Coucil heard
how one of the new sabbatical's ini-
tial responsibilities would be to rep-
resent medical students during the
transitional stages of their move to
the South Kensington campus during
1997 and 1998.
Despite stressing that the new staff
member would not be a "medic's
sabbatical", Deputy President Ms
Corneille expressed her opinion that
someone ought to be available to
help medical students in "coming to
terms with moving from a small inti-
mate college to a large anonymous
one." It is intended that the post
become a more general position after
a couple of years when the merger
issue is less critical.
Mark Pursey, a sabbatical officer
from University College London,
happened to be attending the meeting
with respect to an unrelated matter.

The Imperial College fencing team
has conquered all, winning the
British University Sports Assoc-
iation team event in Birmingham,
defeating Birmingham University
in the final after thrashing
Durham in the semis.
Back in South Kensington, the
fencers are hoping for some extra
money from the Union to pay for
repairs to the BUSA cup after it
was damaged during their slightly
over-zealous victory celebrations.
Both Imperial College's fencing
squad and dance team were victo-
rious in their respective national
competitions, leading a trend of
Imperial College dominance in
these sports.

St Mary's Rag record for Circle Line pub crawl
KENT YIP
St Mary's Hospital Medical School's
annual Rag week has generated
£35,000 so far this year, and more is
expected from sponsorships and
from the London Marathon, in which
many medical students hope to par-
ticipate.
This year also saw a new record
set for the most money raised by a
single event. The Circle Line Pub
Crawl, involving around 400 stu-
dents, brought in an estimated
£19,500. This is an increase of
around £2,000 on the previous
record, set last year.
St Mary's Rag plans to donate
about £20,000 to Motor Neurone
Disease, an organisation devoted to
funding research and providing care
for patients suffering from various
forms of nervous disability. £4,000
will be given to Help The Aged for
their purchase of a new minibus.
What remains will be distributed
among the internal charities of St
Mary's Hospital.
Other Rag Week fund raising
events included the Breakfast Party,
when £4,000 was collected from
Waterloo and Paddington Stations in
the early morning rush hours; the
Rag Dash to Dublin, which yielded
£1,500; and the numerous entertain-
ment evenings - Games Show, Bands
Night, and Comedy Night - all of
which enjoyed an attendance of well
over 300.
Speaking to Felix, Rob Slater,
President of the Rag Committee, said
that he was extremely pleased with
the amount raised and impressed
with the effort put in by all the stu-
dents. Andy King, secretary of the
Rag Committee, expressed his hopes
that after the merger, medical stu-
dents would be able to collaborate
with their scientist and engineer
counterparts and show them how to
run an even more sucessful Rag
Week from the South Kensington
campus.
