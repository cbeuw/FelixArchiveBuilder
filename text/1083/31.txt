TWILIGHT IS UPON IIS ALL
Dark chocolate strikes a blow for taste over silly packaging of inferior milk based products
A fierce debate has suddenly sprung
up over the danger of Easter egg
packaging to small furry animals,
notably gerbils. It is believed that
these seemingly innocuous and
brightly coloured boxes are responsi-
ble for a bizarre epidemic of deaths
amongst small mammals, especially
gerbils.
Nazis
A recent series of experiments per-
formed by former Nazi war criminal
Herr Evell, has uncovered a strange
defect in the way the decorative
packaging is perceived through the
visual cortex of the smaller variant of
furred mammals, particularly gerbils.
It is suspected that the bright colours
combined with the curved dimen-
sions of eggs creates a form of hallu-
cinogenic cross-circuit within the
brains of our more diminuative rela-
tives, making them seemingly
believe that they are eggs and roll
around motionless, pausing occa-
sionally only to explode as a reinact-
ment of the hatching process.
Dead kids
This has lead to growing fears, espe-
cially from concerned parents, that
the boxes might bridge the species
gap and have an adverse effect on
children who don't know any better.
Given that in many cases chocolate
Easter eggs are targeted at the
younger consumer has lead to allega-
tions that the confectionery industry
are involved in some global mind-
control project and it is only sheer
luck that the conspiracy was discov-
ered.
Hypocritical commercialism
Pet shop owners are stunned at the
potential loss of life but when it was
pointed out that many parents whose
small furry pets were inflicted would
have to replace the said pet in order
to keep little Johnny happy, several
pet shops have been reported to have
started stocking Easter eggs them-
selves.
Danger scale
Given these appaling revelations we
at Felix, in the true interest of com-
munity spirit and self-sacrifice, have
taken it upon ourselves to be guinea
pigs and bravely face the unknown
by testing the treat level of the vari-
ous Easter eggs currently available
on the market.
