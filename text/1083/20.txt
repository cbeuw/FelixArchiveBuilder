Letters to Felix
...ride my bicycle?
Dear Felix,
As another bike goes missing pre-
sumed stolen from Beit Quad, not
mine but a friends, 1 wonder what
could be done to try to stop the
thieves doing this. Then it occurred
to me why not make it so that the
entrance and exit were positioned
over by a security room. Then if we
gave all members of college (staff
and students) some form of ID they
could identify themselves as they
entered or exited with a bike.
Revolutionary ideals that would
cost a fortune, the cost of converting
that room at the entrance that dis-
penses snooker equipment and per-
haps installing some gates would run
to millions possibly, and as for
removing the individuals rights by
making everyone have a ID card I
can see the court of human rights
having afieldday.
Yours heavily labouring a point
Gary Smith (Elec Eng PG)
Yes, it does make you wonder how
a bike can get stolen from the most
secure area in college...
political bias in Felix
Dear Alex
While Felix's long established
neutrality was severely strained by
last week's front page news story,
which many saw as advocating a vote
for new election, this week's new
columnist seems to believe that your
paper is a party political instrument.
Readers may be used to Mr Baker's
right wing fascist tendencies, but to
have a writer openly advocate voting
for the Liberal Democrats was just
too much.
Previous issues of Felix with the
aforementioned Tory ranter have
been intensely annoying and I did
wonder whether any balance would
be applied with alternative view
points. Then came along Hamish
with his brand of 'wet conservatism'
to further emphasise your journal's
right of centre tendencies.
But was a column dedicated to the
possibilities of a Lib Dem revolution
with an exhortation to vote for Ms
Osei's favoured group really bal-
ance? Are we to expect a column
urging students to vote New Labour,
and what about Old Labour, the
Referendum Party and the Official
Monster Raving Loony Party?
With the General Election rapidly
approaching I would urge you to
publicly state where your paper
stands on this issue. Would it be too
much to ask for Ms Osei and particu-
larly the ravings of Messers Baker
and 'Common' to be controlled, if
not gagged?
In the hope of an independent and
neutral student newspaper,
Ben Weir
Delegations from the parties you
mentioned have yet to beat a path
to my door, so for now we shall
have to suffice with the metered
opinions of those who are prepared
to put pen to paper.
In any case, I would refute the
suggestion that Miss Osei's piece
came down firmly for the Liberal
Democrats. The view that some
form of change, as opposed to the
united front presented by the two
main parties on most issues, would
be beneficial for the country is a
valid one. The Liberal Democrats,
coming next in line and with a size-
able political heritage themselves,
would be the logical suggestion for
someone purporting to support a
new direction for British politics.
For more detail on this matter
and to set your mind at rest over
the bias of this paper, I would
direct your attention to this week's
feature on the PPC's for the Cities
of London and Westminister con-
stituency.
imperial totty nil point
Dear Felix,
In response to your "Imperial
Totty" article in last weeks Felix, I
would like to make the following
comment to the female student quot-
ed. Although not all the 71.4% of the
male students at IC are "top notch",
of the remaining 28.6%, not all could
be considered to be women, but more
appropriately could be described as
farmyard animals.
Offended IC student
Dear Felix,
Having read your News in Brief
article 'Imperial Totty' I felt I had to
reply. Bollocks.
Talk about the pot calling the ket-
tle black. The law of averages dic-
tates that at least a few of the 6000
males at IC must measure up enough
for the mere 2000 birds, whereas
they, frankly, fall into the category
'rough'. Perhaps if some Cosmo
readers would come sharkin' it
would provide us with some decent
scenery. For a change.
Signed on behalf of the frustrated
male majority of Imperial who have
standards by a selection of
Imperial s manhood
Considering the fact that the
source of the article had nothing to
do with the female population of
the college, these two replies seem
to go after them rather unfairly.
Are we perhaps seeing some inferi-
ority complex coining out here
boys? It would be a shame if the
hordes of Cosmo reading women,
who are without a doubt making a
beeline for our august institution
as I write, were to be put off by the
examples of IC 'manhood' that are
presented here.
So I suggest that all of you (and I
note that the authors of these let-
ters have hidden behind the shield
of anonymity) turn yourselves in to
the 'grotesque IC male' amnesty
that Felix is willing to operate for
the betterment of our environ-
ment. That should leave the better
adjusted people behind to lead rea-
sonable, valuable fat-free lives.
review blues
Dear Felix,
After reading the review of the
new U2 album, POP, in Something
for the Weekend, I felt compelled to
write. There is a serious need to set
the record straight for any of the
readers out there who feel slightly
bemused.
It's a sad state of affairs when the
reviewer finds a need to waste half of
his column space on attacking the
band's new direction. U2's fans have
not been brought up on steady "eco-
rock and emotive ballads". True,
those who appreciate U2's creative
drive and eagerness to include new
ideas and new directions will appre-
ciate the album the most. But those
who do not, have either been spoon
fed a diet of Oasis & Blur three times
a day for the last 2 years or they find
no joy in change. Lets face it U2 have
been so successful because of the
ability to incorporate new style and
direction into their music. Not by sit-
ting back and relying on the same
tried and tested formula.
Another point which I found quite
hard to comprehend was the slam-
ming "Bono and the boys" got for
continuing to give the public a show.
Rather than spitting and sticking two
fingers up at any question or chal-
lenge posed to them, they come right
back and produce an album with all
the hype that goes with a U2 produc-
tion. Hype and change are what
we've come to know and love about
the boy's.
The hype aside, the album on a
first listening did not seem to give all
that was promised. However on a
second listen it becomes apparent
why we've waited in anticipation for
so long to be given the next install-
ment. The wait was worth while and
if any of the reviewer listened to the
album more than once and gave a shit
about what he was doing, then this
would have become apparent.
Discotheque was a production
which shocked and wet the appetites
of the waiting public when released a
few weeks ago. Bono is in his ele-
ment writing some moving ballads
such as If God Will Send His Angels
and If You Wear That Velvet Dress.
There is so much to take in during
one listen, electro experimentation,
soaring melodies, and emotive lyrics,
forgetting to mention the breaks and
Mullens strongest drumming to date,
which does far more than keep the
rhythm. The rest of the album deliv-
ers as far as I'm concerned, roll on
the tour in the summer. How will
they top the Zoo tv tour? is the ques-
tion on most peoples lips. I'm sure
we won't be disappointed.
A final word to any of the review-
ers. Listen to what the fuck your
reviewing and don't dismiss some-
thing because that's the easy option.
And remember we are people con-
cerned with change not sitting stag-
nant dismissing any progress, simply
because its not the norm.

Sometimes it would be nice to get
something right! I agree with a lot
of what you say, though I would
point out that you are speaking
form the perspective of a U2 fan.
The reviewer in question wasn't.
If you feel so strongly about
music, then we want you in our
team of reviewers! Come along to
the meetings in the Felix Office
(far-left corner of Beit Quad),
every Friday lunchtime at 1.30pm.
long live the queen
Dear Felix,
Over the past few years I have
learned to groan every time I see an
article about the pros and cons of the
monarchy. This is not because the
subject does not interest me, far from
it, but because of the frustrating poor-
ness of the arguments usually advo-
cated by the monarchists side. As a
general supporter of the principle of
Parliamentary Monarchy I know that
there are sound reasons for retaining
the institution; reasons concerned
with the liberty and welfare of teh
people, not just the usual polemic
about symbolism, tradition and the
