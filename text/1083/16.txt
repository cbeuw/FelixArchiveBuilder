16 CAPITAL PUNISHMENT F E L I X W E D N E S D A Y 19TH M A R C H
String
On the 28th of October 1965, a
Private Member's Bill received
Royal Assent, abolishing the death
penalty for murder in the United
Kingdom. It had originally been
abolished in the 11th Century by
William the Conqueror, and was
then reinstated by his son William
Rufus. Hangings in England
reached a peak during the reign of
Edward VI in the 1550s, when on
average, one person was executed
every day. The death penalty could
be imposed by magistrates, and
hangings were often carried out on
village greens.
In the 1970s, the Supreme Court in
the United States declared the death
penalty constitutional, reinstating it
after a period of absence. In Britain,
all major political parties have
committed themselves to not rein-
stating the death penalty, and it is
considered politically very danger-
ous to support it. In contrast, the
rate of executions are rising in the
USA, with 38 of the 50 states
allowing for it. Usual methods
include hanging, electrocution,
lethal injection, gas chamber and
firing squad, with some countries,
notably ones observing Sharia
(Islamic Law) beheading, amputat-
ing and stoning prisoners. More
imaginative methods of dispensing
with prisoners include cannibalism
(practised in Africa), Necklacing (a
rubber tire placed around the neck
and set alight), and the 'Thousand
Cuts' (being lashed to death), prac-
tised in China. Historical methods
of execution and torture include
being boiled alive (used against
poisoners in medieval England),
being buried alive, burnt at the
stake (to purify the soul, apparent-
ly), eaten by animals, flayed, drawn
and quartered, impaled (but only
through non-vital organs), being
put on the Iron Chair/Bed (which
was then put on the fire), the Iron
Maiden (female effigies, hollowed
out, with spikes inside: prisoners
were 'embraced' by the Maiden),
crucifixions (originally done from
trees), drowning, being blown from
a cannon, the pendulum (read
Edgar Allan Poe?), poison, press-
ing, rack, sawn in half, death by
insects (popular with Native
Americans against troublesome set-
tlers), shot by arrows (popular with
the Vikings), the Wooden Horse
(you don't want to know), starva-
tion (France had oubliettes who
were imprisoned and 'forgotten
about.'), garrotte, thrown from a
great height, and the Cauldron (you
want to know about this one even
less). There are plenty of interna-
tional treaties banning such horrific
punishments, but it makes me feel
very happy to have been born in the
late 20th Century!
The death penalty is still in force
in the United Kingdom for the mil-
itary offences of mutiny, failure to
suppress mutiny, obstructing opera-
tions and assisting the enemy, plus
the joint civilian and military
offence of treason (itself a very
wide definition of crimes, including
damaging military property or mur-
dering a judge). No-one has been
executed in the UK since 1963.
According to Amnesty
International, 2331 prisoners were
executed last year (the actual figure
is believed to be much higher), with
China scooping the prize with 1791
executions, 77% of the world's
total. Only five countries executed
juveniles in the last few years: Iran,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United
States and Yemen, with the USA
executing more than any other.
The death penalty will forever
remain one of the most controver-
sial world-wide political issues,
although its media exposure in
Britain is reduced. One of the most
controversial executions in recent
years was that of Jesse DeWayne
Jacobs, who was executed in Texas
in January last year, with the vic-
tim's family, and the original pros-
ecutor and court judge protesting
his innocence. The Supreme Court
ruled that it could not overturn the
original jury's verdict. This even
managed to evoke a response from
the Vatican, which described it as
"monstrous and absurd".
Under European Union Law, the
death penalty is now banned in all
states unless in times of emergency.
This has been the case with British
Law for many years, since the mil-
itary offences are only capital 'in
the face of the enemy', and the
death penalty would only be sought
for treason in the most dire cases.
Proponents of the death penalty
cite law and order, and the increas-
ing crime rate as reasons for its jus-
tified existence. It is considered the
best absolute sanction by the State
against the truly evil.
