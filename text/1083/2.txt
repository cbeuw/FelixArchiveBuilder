News in Brief
Department of Mining shafted?
TONY OFORI
At the beginning of March, mining
students in IC's department of
Environmental Resources
Engineering heard that three of their
four lecturers would probably be
leaving. During a meeting held by
Professor Rawlings, Dean of the
Royal School of Mines and head of
department, undergraduates were
told that as of next September there
would be significantly less teaching
staff. Not only will they lose 80% of
their lecturers but this will be accom-
panied by a reduction in support
staff.
Currently there are five courses in
ERE of which two are broadly con-
cerned with mining techniques.
Some 26 students stand to be affect-
ed by the changes. The mining
department may be small, but many
students and staff have expressed
their belief in its value as an individ-
ual subject. Gone are the days when
miners are are pictured wearing
Wellingtons and hard hats, bearing a
Davy lamp in one hand and a pick in
the other. Many now regard mining
as a scientific discipline.
Speaking to Felix, Prof Rawlings
insisted that the quality of the degree
courses will be maintained despite
the cuts, and went on to point out that
the courses are regularly scrutinised
by various examination bodies and
any fall in teaching standards will be
quickly picked up. However, many
students remain unconvinced.
Present plans include keeping one
of the department's principle lectur-
ers, while another three are encour-
aged to take early retirement. These
three would return to work on a part-
time basis, but they would only be
required to work around a tenth of
their current hours.
Understandably, many ERE stu-
dents are bewildered by the current
situation, and cannot see how their
department can function properly
with such a large reduction in teach-
ing staff. Two new courses will be
offered to prospective mining stu-
dents, both focussing on the environ-
mental aspect of mining. Some
observers fear that the intention is to
phase out 'pure' mining degrees and
replace them with shallower courses
concentrating on environmental con-
cerns.
According to Prof Rawlings, "eco-
nomic considerations" are the dri-
ving force behind this radical staff
restructuring. At the moment the
department feels unable to maintain
its current staffing level within its
budget. The mining department in
the RSM is the only one in the coun-
try supported solely by research
funding. This presents the depart-
ment with a problem: they may not
be able to support the staff they have,
but without these staff cannot hope to
win the funding they need.
Some students argue that the move
to fewer teaching staff may make
financial sense but is academic non-
sense. ERE undergraduates may face
a significant drop in teaching quality.
With only one full-time lecturer and
26 students the staffstudent ratio
will be relatively high. In addition,
links with industry forged by current
lecturers may be severed upon their
departure, making it difficult for stu-
dents to gain a foothold in commer-
cial mining.
ERE also suffers from a deficit of
new recruits to the teaching staff,
with three lecturers within 5 years of
retirement age. In response, Prof
Rawlings alluded to the difficulty in
finding new lecturers in the mining
discipline combining both youth and
talent.
Another point of concern is a new
European university exchange
scheme for mining students. If the
teaching staff leave the department
as proposed, IC will no longer be
able fulfill its commitment to the stu-
dents from German, Dutch and
Finnish universities. This will may
also have serious implications for the
IC students participating in the
exchange, as they may be rendered
unable to complete their course.
THIEF ARRESTED
A man wanted by the police was
apprehended in the Biochemistry
Building on Monday evening. He
was found in possession of several
stolen items and went to court last
Tuesday charged with a variety of
crimes.
Security were alerted by a woman
in the Biochemistry Dept who rang
them after recognising a man whom
she had disturbed rifling through her
handbag a week previously. After a
brief chase, Security caught and
detained the man, managing to hold
him until the police arrived. On their
arrival the police informed Security
that the man was wanted for burglary
and theft by both the Metropolitan
and the City of London police forces.
A disconsolate Ken Weir, Head of
sucurity, expressed his dismay over
the level of knowledge displayed by
the thief "He seemed to know his
way around the building quite well,
he was going into offices with open
doors and taking wallets and purses."
This incident again calls into ques-
tion the effectiveness of College's
security and raises the possibility of a
full surveillance system being
installed.
UNION SHOPS A R O U N D
FOR NEW BUSINESS
The Union Bookstore closes for busi-
ness on Friday 21st March, and will
remain closed for a month while
refurbishment takes place. When the
Bookstore re-opens on the 21st
April, it will bear the new and imag-
inative title, 'The Union Shop'.
The new shop will sell the same
product range as before but without
the books, the contract to supply
books on campus having been taken
over by Waterstones. The 'Shop'
will essentially sell stationery, but
should include a few new product
lines. The newsagent on the opposite
side of the Walkway will remain
unaffected by the changes, and the
20% sale on all books remains in
place until the close of business on
Friday. Waterstone's expects to
begin trading on the first day of next
term, the same day as the new Union
Shop.
ELECTION RULES C H A N G E
Several changes to the rules govern-
ing ICU's sabbatical elections have
been proposed, following the contro-
versy generated by this year's cam-
paigns.
At a meeting of ICU Council last
Tuesday night, Eric Allsop, ICU
President, commented that there
were "holes in the election rules", but
that the opportunity exists to rectify
this. The most significant changes
are likely to surround the 'New
Election' campaign, with the possi-
bility of a body being set up to regu-
late its actions.
This would attempt to avoid a
repeat of events this year, when Felix
was heavily criticised for its pes-
simistic reporting of the hustings,
and was accused of inciting students
to vote against the candidates. Some
supporters of defeated candidates
have claimed that Felix deliberately
attempted to influence student opin-
ion, openly supporting the alternative
candidates should 'New Election' be
returned for the post of ICU presi-
dent.
Also under consideration is a pro-
posal to place a copy of each candi-
date's manifesto along side each bal-
lot box, to allow students to read
them before voting. The Elections
Committee will decide when they
meet next week exactly what
changes are to be made.
The nomination papers for the new
ICU Presidential elections are to be
put up opposite the Union office on
the first Monday of next term.
Speculation over exactly who will
put themselves forward for the post
is still rife.
SILVER LINING FOR
C L A U D S ?
'Mr T's', the snack shop on the third
floor of the R S M building closed
down for good on the 3rd of
February. In its place has opened
'Clauds', a very similar venture oper-
ated by Everdina Clarke.
The decision to close T's came
well before last Christmas, with Ms
Clarke, placing her tender for the
shop soon afterwards. The College
spent roughly Â£2000 cleaning and
sanitising the premises before its new
proprietors took over. Ms Clarke
then bought new equipment and dis-
play cabinets for sandwiches and
drinks. The College placed condi-
tions on the operations of the shop,
including a ban on frying as "it made
the place smell" and also to try and
keep prices low. According to Ms
Clarke, the few months it has been
open were being used as a trial peri-
od. In October, she plans to add
more types of food to the menu
including baked potatoes and intends
to change the tables and chairs in the
eating area at some point, describing
the present furniture as 'grotty'. The
primary concern, however, would be
the food.
