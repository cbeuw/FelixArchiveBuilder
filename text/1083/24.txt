Sailors cruise home
Once more the colleges of the
University of London fight it out for
the "Castaways Team Racing Cup".
For once Imperial weren't the
favourites with Guy's & Thomies
fielding helms from London's first
team. Imperial were thrown in the
deep end with their first race against
Guy's & Thomies which ended up
being a close action, adrenaline
pumping, Euro 96 kind of race, with
of course a final mistake costing
Imperial the white ribbon. After a
few confidence building races
against other colleges and some time
to sober up from the night before, the
DT shaken Imperial squad were set
up for the leagues second round race
against Guy's & Thomies. This time
Imperial took control with Simon
Smith and James "FLEES" Lees hav-
ing to slow down due to their
immense speed, while the 2 Andys
(Jones & Keen) played around with
Guy's & Thomies boats holding
them back.
So the stage was set with both
teams recording one loss each and a
one race final being the decider. The
first start was a lucky escape since
Simon & FLEES were using London
Underground watches, so they
thought the start was a minute later
than everybody else thought. So
after the Guy's & Thomies boats
were recalled back, after sailing into
the sunset in a clear winning position,
the start was once more sounded but
this time Imperial taking the com-
manding position and WINNING.
Thanks go out to Tony and Tash
from Castaways for running the
event. Good luck to Imperial Sailing
Team in their BUSA qualifiers.
All-comers tangoed by IC
On Saturday 8th March, 24 Imperial
College Dance Club Team members
travelled to Watford Town Hall to
compete in the Inter Varsity Dance
Association (IVDA) Competition. In
their usual spectacular style they won
the competition, beating strong
opposition from Cambridge, Oxford,
Bristol and U L U to name just a few.
They picked up the A-Team trophy,
2nd Place B-Team Trophy and 3rd
Place C-Team, displaying yet again
their superiority on the dance floor.
With feathers, sequins and chiffon
flying everywhere, Jo Silmon-Clyde
(Team Captain) and Helen Chung,
David Schaefer and Ruth Bundy
achieved 2nd Places in the Quickstep
and Waltz respectively for the A-
Team. The Jive competition was a
closely fought affair with Nevil
Pesika and Hazie Hamzah collecting
2nd Place for the Latin A-Team after
only five days practice. Naveen
Gunawardane and Lianne Huang
sailed into their 2nd Place position
with their evocative version of the
Cha-Cha-Cha.
101 Dalmations, (well, 16 any-
way), slid, pranced and prowled
around the dance floor to win the off-
beat competition, (formation danc-
ing). However, even the cute dog
outfits made by the team members
could not have won without the
amazingly attractive Cruella De Vil
(David Schaefer) in his/her black
dress, long eyelashes and wild hair-
do.
Winning is not a new concept to
IC Dance Club. They are arguably
the best University Dance Team in
Britain winning competitions across
the country for a number of years.
Two factors contribute to their con-
sistent success. The first is the amaz-
ing dedication of the dancers
involved whose long hours of prac-
tice are paid off with excellent com-
petition results. The second is the
superb coaching of Dorothy Charlton
(Modern) and Vicky Cunniffe
(Latin-American). Thank you for all
your hard work and patience. Sadly,
at the end of this year we lose some
of our senior members to bigger and
better things. Jo and company -
You'll be missed.
Another sports editorial
With a two-one win against
Holloway on Wednesday, ICFC
firsts could still be crowned league
leaders if they win their last match of
the season.
The fencers and dancers have
proved again that mighty IC can
compete on a national stage, even if
we can't win University Challenge
two years on the trot.
Swashbuckling swordsman
slash to victory
A lot of people have accused the
fencing club of being rather arrogant
this year. Which is fair enough,
because we are. We have also lived
up to our own high expectations by
winning the BUSA championships
in Birmingham last Saturday. With
foil team pulled off the last 8 fights
to give Imperial a 13-5 lead going
into the epee, one short of victory.
The first fight went to Birmingham,
but in the next Henry brought us
home with a 5-4 victory to give
Imperial its first title since 1991. We
victories over Nottingham, Bradford
and reigning champions Oxford en
route to the finals, we could already
taste victory. After the free draw we
faced Durham in the semi-finals,
possibly our biggest threat.
With our weakest weapon (epee)
up first, our opponents went 1 -0, and
then 2-1 up. From then on, it all
went horribly wrong for the north-
erners [Oi watch it - northern and
fencing team Sports Ed.], as we took
the last 6 epee fights to lead 7-2
going into the foil. Such is the
strength of our foilists, that the
BUSA individual champion is the
weakest member of the team. Hence
we rattled off another 9 victories
without breaking into a sweat to take
us past the 14 wins we needed for
victory. So a demoralised Durham
decided that they would run for
home, and conceded the sabre bouts.
A final score of 25-2 to Imperial.
In the final we faced the home
favourites, Birmingham, who had
narrowly squeezed past the token
Scottish team from Heriot-Watt in
the other semi.
Sabre was up first this time, and
some good fencing from
Birmingham restricted us to only a 5-
4 lead going into the foil. A minor
hiccup in the first foil fight let
Birmingham draw level, but after
that we were never in danger as our
could now afford to relax, and won
two more fights to leave the final
score 16-11 to Imperial.
In the absence of club chairman
Reuben Kalam, men's captain Nick
Manton went forward to receive the
trophy, together with Henry Morton
to receive a tankard for fencer of the
tournament. The team for the finals
was: -
Foil - Henry "Mad Dog" Morton,
Eddie "Crazy Legs" Rysdale, David
"Damage" Davidge (who remained
unbeaten all season)
Epee - Nigel "Old Geezer"
Davies, Henry "Mad Dog" Morton,
Eddie "Crazy Legs" Rysdale, Phil
"Perry" Miller
Sabre - Thorsten "Sebastian"
Meyer, Mo "Mr. Animal" Mansoori,
Nick "Ray" Manton
Also, thanks must go to Sarah
Corneille for organising the week-
end, and especially to Duncan
Tindall for giving up his weekend to
drive us to Birmingham, and sup-
porting us without a clue as to what
was going on!
Don't worry BUSA, we'll fix the
trophy before next year, its only in
three bits, and the cup can be ham-
mered back into shape - we'll have
our passing skills improved by then
as well.
If we still have any money left, we
want to go on a tour this year.
