Union President is pawn to King's Rag stunt
KELLY ROBINSON
Students from King's College took a
detour from traditional fund raising
routes during their recent Rag week,
by holding assorted Students' Union
representatives from the across the
University of London to ransom.
The Rag Committee fired off a
series of hoax faxes, purportedly
from Duncan Rasor, KCLSU presi-
dent, calling for an emergency
Executive Committee meeting to dis-
cuss the disaffiliation of King's
College Union from both University
of London Union and the National
Union of Students.
Senior officers from the aforemen-
tioned organizations, as well as
prominent representatives from other
London Universities were requested
to attend, under the apprehension that
King's students were in desperate
need of their expert opinion.
The honoured 'Guests' included
Alison Griffin, the National Secretary
for the NUS, and the London
School of
Economics
U n i o n
G e n e r a l
Secretary,
Dan Crowe,
as well as
I m p e r i a
C o l l e g e
Union's own
President, Eric
Allsop.
The meeting
c o m m e n c e d ,
without Mr
Allsop, in the
usual fashion, but
was suddenly inter-
rupted when the
' E x e c u t i v e
Comittee' removed
their tops to reveal King's R A G T-
Shirts. They then led their bemused
victims to the bar, where they pro-
ceeded to ply them
with beer and sand-
wiches. The unsus-
pecting Mr Allsop
arrived late, but was
met by the same
fate.
Kenny Roberts,
K C L S U Vice
President, later
c o m m e n t e d :
"We would like
to stress that
none of them
were tied up
or treated bru-
tally in any
way. It was a
typical rag
week joke, and
didn't cause any harm to those
involved. In fact, I think most of us
enjoyed it quite a lot!"
Those present greeted the whole
incident in the spirit with which it
was intended and were promptly
released when their respective
College Unions begrudgingly paid
the £50 ransom demands. KCLSU is
reported to have made a grand total of
£200 for their nominated charities, a
princely sum for an afternoon's
drinking. Later, Eric Allsop described
the jape as "poorly timed but well
constructed." He went on to comment
that "I was treated adequately; as in
accordance with the Geneva
Convention."
Despite a specific personal invita-
tion to the fictitious meeting in the
fax, University of London Union
President, Sarah White, failed to fall
for the fundraising stunt. Presumably
Ms White learnt her lesson last year
when, as ICU President, she was kid-
napped by St Mary's Rag in a similar
incident. Although the then President
was missing for over 24 hours, no-
one at ICU noticed until they
recieved the ransom demand.
C&GCU Election results
N E W S T E A M
The City & Guilds College Union
executive elections took place last
week, with the results announced on
Friday evening.
Vivake Bhalla beat off stiff com-
petition from four other candidates to
win the race for President after five
rounds of counting, with Aku Patel
acceding to the position of Vice-
President.
Soren Dymond will be Honorary
Junior Treasurer, following his sur-
prise victory over Akshay Shah, who
seemed assured of victory until a
third round count awarded the vast
majority of New Election's reallocat-
ed votes to Mr Dymond. Mansoor
Ahmed was returned as
Entertainments Officer, narrowly
achieving the quota to beat his oppo-
nent on the first round.
Candidates for the three other
C&GCU executive positions were
opposed only by New Election, with
Hamish Common becoming
Guildsheet Editor, Hannah Pearson
returning to the executive next year
as C & G C Association Rep-
resentative, and Selina Vinayaga-
Pavan elected by the largest majority
of any candidates Publicity Officer.
A total of 350 votes were cast at
ballot boxes in six departments
around the campus, representing
roughly a tenth of those eligible to
vote and an increase of 27% over the
number of votes cast last year. This
relatively high turnout comes in the
wake of the success of this year's
ICU sabbatical elections, where 17%
of the electorate expressed a prefer-
ence. One concern for students
counting the votes was the number of
spoilt papers, with around a fifth of
the ballot papers filled out incorrect-
ly in some departments.
The present executive were report-
ed to be pleased with the number of
people standing for positions, the
highest in recent years, and with the
number of people voting.
They look forward to an active
year for City and Guilds College
Union, and invite anyone who is
interested in working on the team to
get in contact with them via the C & G
Office.
ULU Election results
N E W S T E A M
At U L U Council on Monday night,
the four sabbatical officers who will
represent the University of London's
82000 students next year were elect-
ed.
First up were the two candidates
for President, where Siva
Ganeshanandan (this year's General
Secretary at Royal Holloway Union),
beat off Mark Pursey (ULU Chair
and U C L sabbatical at UCL), win-
ning by 40 votes to 33. Both candi-
dates seized upon the need to act fast
to secure London Transport discount
cards for U L U students, before pri-
vatisation takes place. Both candi-
dates promised to oppose any threat
of fees or top-up charges, Mr Pursey
repeatedly stating his success in
keeping fees out of the UCL prospec-
tus. Neither candidate put forward
any scheme which they would defi-
nitely support, and followed each
other in expressing the need for U L U
to take a greater role in the NUS,
drawing cries of 'shame' from the IC
delegation.
There was very little difference
between the two candidates, and
questions from the floor did little to
draw a distinction as only three ques-
tions were permitted by the
Returning Officer.
Imperial's own Jo Paice stood
unopposed for the position of Vice
President (Finance & Services) and
beat off the New election challenge
by 36 to 25. She promised to give
greater financial accountability, a
greater return on the investment
which College Unions put into U1,U,
more resources for sports and soci-
eties and smaller Colleges, and more
forward planning to allow U L U to
work alongside, rather than in com-
petition with, constituent Colleges
and Unions.
Elsewhere, Dan Brown combated
the (non-existent) New-Election
challenge, wining by 41 votes to 16
to take the post of Vice President
(Sports & Societies) for 97/98, and
Sam Parham won the role of V-P
(Welfare & Representation) 30-29
after the first reallocation of votes,
having tied 29-29 with Mark Hill on
the first count.
