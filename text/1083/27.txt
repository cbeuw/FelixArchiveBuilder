TOP TPS
Don't waste money on new books.
Simple take an old one, tippex out
the writing and put new text on top.
A biro (15p) is perfect for this.

Bookstore.
For a more professional looking
result, cut out letters from old news-
papers and use them instead.

If you must buy new books, meet me
under the Sherfield steps at 10pm on
Tuesday. Cash only. Just don't buy
them in Waterstones. Please.

Taxi drivers - save yourself the
trouble and expense of running a cab
by simply wandering around with a
Uzi and shooting students' legs off.
M. Roadkill.
Brixton
Southside shop - don't waste time
opening the shop in the morning,
simply mug passers-by in broad day-
light.
E.J Smith
Tizzard Hall.
Security officers - A French loaf
makes an excellent holder for
doughnuts, and when you've fin-
ished them you can spread it with
chocolate, bend it into a ring, and eat
it. Mmmm. Doughnuts.

The Sandwich Shop
Students - don't go to the effort of
washing your pillow case each year,
simply use a black bin bag instead.
When you've finished your degree,
just throw it away! (and sleep in the
bag).
Stink
Battersea
Builders, don't make the extra effort
to be quiet, just keep banging away
until everyone is deaf and can't hear
you anyway.
B. Student
the Library
Builders, why try and string coher-
ent sentences together when just
shouting random crap interspersed
with the occasional word will keep
everyone guessing as to what your
really trying to complain about.

The Library
Astrophysicists - a disposable cam-
era sellotaped onto a brick and
thrown vigorously into the air makes
a great alternative to a satellite-based
spectrometer. And you can spend the
remaining money on beer. All £2.50
of it.
Faceless Bureaucrat.
Sherfield.
Ian Bayley - Try eating less biscuits
and sausages and more real food,
you tory scum.
Major
Downing St.
Alex Feakes - a microphone con-
nected to a fuck-off massive amplifi-
er might just allow people to hear
what you are saying. Possibly.
Maths students - Avoid making
embarrassing snoring noises during
lecture by not going in the first place.
Then recreate the notes by cutting up
a Greek newspaper and throwing it
about.
Pleb
Biology.
Biochemists - stop making up new
words as I am trying to revise and it
makes life difficult.

Football fans - don't waste money
on expensive tickets. Just put your
table football table on a spinning
washing machine and yell
URRRRRRRGH!
Vegetarians - dried dog turds make
a fine alternative to expensive soya
protein. And piss can be used to turn
milk in to vegetarian cottage cheese.
Run out of vinegar? Just squeeze
out a copy of Guildsheet and the vit-
riol will provide a tart taste for your
chips. But the crap won't.
Mr Sarson.
Dustmen - amuse yourselves by
kicking open bags of rubbish and
yelling instead of collecting them.
T Banks-
House of Commons
Students - get your own back on
dustmen by filling your rubbish bags
with shit. This also saves on water
bills.
