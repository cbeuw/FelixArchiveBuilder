As regular readers of this column
will know, every now and then I get
caught with my trousers down.
Statistically, that is. And so it
appeared last week following Mike
Hansen's letter. I thought that this
might be picked up on, since I was
less than sure about its veracity, but
being a responsible journalist I
thought what the Hell and went
ahead with it. Then, better late than
never, I checked it out. Nottingham,
so their General Office tell me, have
15,600 students. Figures provided by
my friends in the Registry say that
we have 7,790 (1995/96). Since
number of students has some bearing
on university size, let's say that they
are about twice as big as us. Using
Mr Hansen's own figures, since
Nottingham have yet to respond, we
have 30% more staff in our Finance
function than an organisation that is
100% bigger. Make of that, ladies
and gentlemen, what you will.
The highly entertaining series on the
great and the good of IC reached
Personnel last week. First rate inter-
view, but I suspect that a couple of
questions were cut for reasons of
space. They might have been the fol-
lowing. Firstly, how do you justify a
department which consumes over
£1 million annually and requires 33
staff? M y limited experience of
industry suggest that this is over the
top. If this department C i vy-i /-v yi
has been rationalised,
I dread to think what
Dr Kimberley inherit-
ed; incidentally, I
thought restructuring
was intended to cut
costs not decrease
workload. Not con-
tent with 33 staff, we
see that this number
will rise by a third
when the medical
mergers are complet-
ed. This is getting y 0 j C e 0 f
ridiculous, particular-
ly when one notes that some of these
staff will, if I understand correctly,
be handing out P45s to some of the
technical support staff from Mary's
lost in the merger. Secondly, why is
it damned near impossible to remove
staff who are clearly incompetent or
superfluous- the only example that
springs to mind is the Mary's cashier
that half-inched £650,000. Perhaps I
am being a little harsh, since Marion
Kimberley is relatively new in the
job, and I have every confidence that
she will rapidly realise the lunacy of
what was probably handed to her on
her arrival. Time will tell.
Incidentally,
B a k e r
I appreciated, though
totally disagreed with,
the force of your con-
victions on the
monarchy and the
hereditary principle.
Since property lies at
the centre of this, I
naturally assume that
you will not make a
will, so as to avoid
charges of hypocrisy.
Away from SW7, it
was marvellous to see
D A / i P A M that my master plan
tor the welfare state is
becoming government policy
(there's modesty for you). The effec-
tive privatisation of pensions will
ensure that we, the first generation to
benefit if it comes to fruition, will
receive substantially more money
than our parents for much less outlay.
The net result should be a saving of
about £40 billion per year from 2040
onwards. In today's prices that would
allow an income tax cut of about 22p.
The potential for economic growth
stemming from this policy is awe-
some, and it is good to see such a
long-term outlook taken on an issue
which could become very serious if
left alone, as is the case in Germany
and France. The pensions deficit in
Germany is predicted to be 430% of
GDP in 40 years, in other words $16
trillion. Yet again, we lead and
Europe follows, as they surely will.
Some of you will remember that at
times I have been less than charitable
about Schal. Unfortunately, those
with the best memories all seem to
work on the BMS project, so it was
with some trepidation that I accepted
an invitation to look around the site.
I must say that I was very impressed
and found it most enjoyable. Thanks
must go to Phil Hilton and Oliver
Clarke who gave the tour, but a spe-
cial mention is in order for the 120+
men (and women) currently on the
site. An altogether un-motley crew,
who resisted numerous opportunities
to throw me off the top of the build-
ing. Without meaning to sound
incredibly patronising (who, me?),
these lot really know the score, with
the project on time and to budget, in
stark contrast to every other IC pro-
ject in living memory. Shame they're
giving it to the medics...
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
And now
for some-
thing com-
pletely dif-
ferent. The
arrival of
the internet has brought with it polit-
ical parties of all hues. This has been
a silent revolution to the 95% of the
country who don't have a modem
(and couldn't care less anyway), but
has caused friction on the issue of
censorship and the question of juris-
diction over the net.
Of course, no one country does
have jurisdiction: national laws are
merely bye-laws covering a small
portion of the net. What can be done
is to make it more difficult for
'unsuitable' material to appear on the
web, by putting pressure on Internet
Service Providers, and passing infor-
mation to the police within the coun-
try concerned. This can only have a
minor effect, as small well-funded
organisations can easily move
around, with the bureaucracy of each
country never quite able to catch up.
Such problems have already tied
many countries censorship laws in
knots, which gives a wonderful
opportunity for this columnist to look
at some of the good, the bad and dan-
gerously ugly among the political
landscape.
Naturally, the mainstream political
parties have a professional if rather
bland presence on the web, accessi-
ble at www.conservative-
party.org.uk, www.labour.org.uk,
and www.libdems.org.uk. The
Conservative and Labour websites
do look worryingly similar to each
other, but all three have the usual mix
of membership information, their
own spin on major news stories, plus
various other titbits including
Labour's on-line shop. Smaller par-
liamentary parties are well represent-
ed on the web, including the Scottish
National Party, Plaid Cymru (Welsh
Nationalists), and the ubiquitous
Referendum Party, at
www.snp.org.uk, www.plaid-
cymru.wales.com, and www.refer-
endum.org.uk. The two nationalist
parties (it is interesting that nothing
could be found on Northern Ireland -
anyone out there know of any?)
demand their usual things: self-gov-
ernment, 'improvements to our cul-
ture' and so on. Indeed Plaid Cymru
triumphantly announces its attempt
for Wales to join the United Nations
- good luck! Finally, the Referendum
Party witters on about Europe.
The reasons why mainstream
political parties and extremist organ-
isations use the web are different.
Political parties must be seen to up
with the latest technology (being old-
fashioned is rarely in vogue) and a
web site is a good way of doing this.
The political benefits are small: only
a tiny number of people have internet
access, and are unlikely to change
allegiance due to a trendy site. It is
more a case of not looking a fool in
front of other parties by having an
obviously inferior site, with all the
unfavourable media attention that
that may bring. There was a case in
December last year, when a group
calling themselves the Digital
Anarchists hacked into Labour's web
site, replaced Blair's photo with his
Spitting Image puppet, added links to
porn sites and generally amused
themselves at Labour's expense.
The web is a much more powerful
tool for extremist organisations,
however, and there plenty of them to
be found. Given their nature as small
and often international organisations,
the web provides a perfect medium
for information and contacts to be
established cheaply and quickly.
Such sites include: British National
Party, at ngwwmall.com/frontier
/bnp/, Crosstar: www.nationalist.
org, the New Communist Party of
Great Britain, at www.geocities.
com/CapitolHill/2853, and the
Natural Law Party at www.natural-
law-party.org.uk. It is worth noting
that these sites are far more sensible -
many professionally produced - than
their usual image would suggest. The
BNP's website informs us that they
do not condone violence, and take
care to remain within the law regard-
ing racial relations. Digging a little
deeper, the racial supremacists' dis-
cussion groups are brimming with
racist ranting, so there is little doubt
as to the real motives of the parties.
The Communist Party's site is a fair-
ly sensible discussion on socialism
and communism, talking of what
might be realistically attainable and
discussing mainstream political
events in a socialist light.
Although the web is only a minor
part of political debate - newspapers
and television and infinitely more
powerful tools for publicity - it is an
interesting one. It is not only a medi-
um for publicity but the subject of
much publicity itself, partly due to
some of the organisations listed
above. It may not necessarily do
much to further political debate,
since you are only exposed to one
opinion at a time, but it does allow
you to look at the issues rather than
the soundbites and the smiles. There
is some interesting, boring, verbose
and quite sickening material around,
but for a change the content is more
important than the packaging.
