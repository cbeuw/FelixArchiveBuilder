BAYS days SET '97 off with a bang!
MATTHEW BENNETT
Friday saw the Queen's Lawn invad-
ed twice for the launch of two sci-
ence and engineering initiatives.
Science and Technology Week 1997
and The British Association of
Young Scientists shared a network of
temporary marquees covering the
lawn for a number of events and dis-
plays.
The first invasion was for the start
of the BAYS two day event, which
combined exhibitions in the Natural
History Museum, the Science
Museums and in IC, on both the
Queen's lawn and the Sherfield
building. The two BAYS days were
billed as "Two days of fun and dis-
covery for 6-13 year olds, schools
and families at the science festival
that launches SET '97- the national
week of science, engineering and
technology."
Friday's event was mainly intend-
ed for school parties, who turned up
in their hundreds to see displays by
British Aerospace, Sun Systems,
Thames water, Glaxo Welcome and
the Armed Forces. The demonstra-
tions included experiments with
chemical slime, raspberry jelly lasers
and that perennial favourite, explod-
ing custard.
The participating companies
adopted varying approaches to the
event, with some displays, such as
that from Sun Systems, aimed main-
ly at the adults in the parties while
Glaxo Wellcome's presentation was
clearly intended to provide 'hands
on' experience of basic science prin-
ciples for the younger visitors.
Demonstrators at the British
Aerospace display claimed that their
main thrust was in sparking interest

in science, while their display also
contained elements obviously
designed to promote BA among a
more mature audience. Their collec-
tion of small autonomous robots,
however, proved popular with every-
one that saw them.
The teachers and parents present
also differed in their attitude to the
event, with some bringing pupils
hoping to promote an interest in sci-
ence, while others saw the occasion
as an opportunity to give their
charges a brief respite from the tedi-
um of the classroom.
The second invasion was some-
what more carefully regimented,
consisting a small army of middle
aged men in suits, attending the
launch of SET '97, YES (the Year of
Engineering Success) and the BAYS
days.
In turn, the Duke of Kent, Ian
Taylor M P (Minister for science and
technology) and heads of the various
interested organisations showered
the assembled suits with acronym-
laden rhetoric concerning the
increasing importance of science and
in particular engineering to our
everyday lives.
Many observers were disappoint-
ed that pure science was largely
ignored in the speeches, although
those on the stands stressed that
today's science will be tomorrow's
technology. British Aerospace in par-
ticular were positive about working
with universities (including IC) on
projects with no immediate techno-
logical applications.
Numerous pieces of technology
developed by Imperial College
groups were on display, including a
laser cutting device which launched
SET '97, theatrically etching the ini-
tiative's name into a piece of plastic.
This technology is similar, it was
pointed out, to that used in cutting
holes to reduce turbulence in aircraft
wings.
One teacher described the event as
"brilliant", while the minister for
Science and Technology somewhat
mistakenly described it as a coming
together of IC and UCL, which it was
not. Elsewhere hundreds of uncon-
cerned school children squealed with
delight over green slime.
Incompetent' Overseas Students' Committee under fire
MARIA IOANNOU
The executive of the Overseas
Students' Committee faced the possi-
bility of a vote of no confidence at
ICU Council last Tuesday, after the
Union's Budgets Advisory Group
recieved no annual budget from the
OSC despite repeated reminders of
the approaching deadline for budget
submissions.
B A G , a subcommittee of the
Union Finance Committee, recom-
mended to Council that the OSC,
who they described as "grossly
incompetent", recieve a vote of no
confidence, effectively sacking them.
However, believing that this some-
what extreme measure might result
in the total disintegration of the OSC,
members of the Council turned down
the proposal as there would be no-
one to replace the existing executive.
In an attempt to defend herself,
Despina Crassa, the present OSC
chair, raised a myriad of points, some
of which were confirmed by various
members of Council. That the B A G
does not provide a good 'model'
budget, Despina claimed, is problem-
atic for many of the Union's clubs
and societies.
Ms Crassa went on to confess "I'm
useless at tax and VAT, I don't know
what's going on."
Despina also told the Council how
she had recieved last year's OSC
papers in a Sainsbury's bag and
asked how she was meant to write
budgets, arrange International Night,
and sort out the "mess" left by the
previous years OSC, all with the help
of "one competent, and one incom-
petant treasurer, who in effect cancel
each other out."
Piers Williams, Deputy President
(Finance and Services) who headed
BAG this year, proposed that those
clubs that behaved incompetently
with regards to their budgets recieved
either a "Slap", a "Big Slap" or a
"Very Big Slap". The OSC were
deemed worthy of a "Very Big Slap",
and the beleaguered Ms Crassa was
asked to submit the budget by next
week at the latest. She was also
informed that all the Overseas
Students' Societies for which she is
responsible face having their budgets
cut to two-thirds of the amount they
recieved this year.
In defence of Despina, Sarah
Corneille, Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies) said that she did not
think that the OSC had "neglected
their duties over the year as a whole,
not to the extent where a vote of no
confidence would be the correct
course of action."
