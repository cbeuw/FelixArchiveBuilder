' the PA Cup was
sadly diluted by Chelsea's win at,
Portsmouth, but if Chesterfield can
put m the kind of performance that
Hcdnesford managed against
Middlesborough they might :,be in
with a shout. They have already
knocked out Blackburn, Nottingham
Forest and Bolton who were i l l on
good form at the time of the match.
Meanwhile Leicester quietly booked

Wimbledon's expense on Tuesday
night,"they are likely to face
Robson's Middle.sborough. With

C&G slaughter everyone
On the morning of Saturday the first
of March, the massed ranks of
ICRPC mat to compete for the
Courtman Shield at Bisley. This is an
annual rifle competition held
between the constituent colleges of
IC. The morning was spent shooting
full-bore rifles at three hundred yards
at targets with a V-bull of three and
three quarter inches in diameter. By
the end of this, C & G had taken an
early lead, closely followed by RCS
and RSM.
The afternoon saw shooting at
five-hundred yards. Here C&G's star
shot, Andrew, decided that our
Spanish army surplus ammo was not
good enough for his rifle and
switched to his hand loaded, radar
guided rounds, each of which cost
£44.99 and is lovingly polished on
the inner thigh of Belinda the
Beautiful Bisley Butt marker. He
then proceeded to score 34.4 out of
35.7. He was said to be disappointed
at dropping one but this performance
still guaranteed C & G victory thanks
also to sterling efforts from Rupert
Ingham and Lawrence von Gould.
The exact placing were 1st C & G
185.8; 2nd RSM 173.0; 3rd RCS
171.4.
Wednesday nineteenth of March
gas been declared a full-bore day.
This could be your last chance to
shoot the guns that will soon by
banned. End of season membership
costs only £4.
In February the IC canoeists went to
the Last Chance meet in Wales.
Well, this weekend's rain has just
conspired to give us not only one of
the most challenging weekend's
canoeing - but also one of the most
expensive.
Frank and Rob showed improve-
ment on the upper section of the
Jools in the front of the Duo for safe-
ty reasons. Everything proceeded
without hitch, until we were con-
fronted with a tricky section near
Bethseda. Ross at this point consult-
ed a local for route advice (he fol-
lowed a duck), but Colin swam under
our feathered friend's route guid-
ance. Plenty of choice on the next
Glaslyn, whilst Jools tackled the
gorge with more enthusiasm than
control, after the reserve force of
Garth, Colin and Adam turned up
with some new kit, very handy when
your best set of paddles have just
become 'missing in action'.
Food in the pub was OK, but there
was a disappointing level of interest
in the beer from the boys, although
the backwards ladder climbing game
was strangely popular on return to
the hut.
Rain that night caused rivers to
rise. Scouting early, the Ogwen
looked ripe to paddle, but on arrival
later the level had risen considerably,
and just looking inspired 'The Fear'
in most members present. Today's
paddle looked to be an exercise in
proving adrenaline to be brown and
to accumulate in the back of your
wetty. After checking what the rest
of the river looked like below the
Gun Barrel (it's that fast!), it was
decided that this was probably just
about within (at?, beyond?) the limits
of most of those present. We're a
sturdy bunch, but this was a trip only
the truly mad would attempt.
Setting off, Piers and Garth took
the foolish step of running the Gun
Barrel, in the Topo Duo. After a
painful swim and some comedy rope
rescues, we set off again, but with
stretch as we made it to the start of
the hard bit - Fisherman's Gorge.
Lots of water pouring down a boul-
der channel made for a very technical
and intensive descent. This certainly
took it's toll on the boys - Jez and
James falling early (although the
Duo did land on an upside down Jez,
rather prompting him to get out).
Garth and Jools ran most of the
length of this section with few prob-
lems -the Topo sheds pins very easi-
ly, and they almost seemed in con-
trol. However the sheer number of
drops meant that a mistake had to
come.... only three more little drops
to the end too. The Gorge claimed
five swims, with Neil demonstrating
his stunning lack of ability to paddle
roll. Ben and Adam also swam on the
last section, to their great annoyance
(and our delight?), and so with just
three left paddling, it really meant it
was time to throw in the towel.Our
thanks to Frank, Rob and Piers for
standing in the rain and strapping the
boats on must be recorded here.
Poor swimming excuses from this
trip -
Nothing at all from Ross, for being
the only one not to swim.
