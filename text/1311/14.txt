So we kick off the year with a picture
quiz, for a change.
It’s pretty straightforward: we’ve
mixed up (badly) two famous (or not-
so-famous) faces, and you just have
to tell us who’s who. Just to give you
a little helping hand, there are nine
actors, three musicians, two ‘lead-
ers’, a director and a model.

4. “I’m afraid. I’m afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can

5. “You’re a hell of an instinctive pilot. Maybe too good. I’d like to bust your

do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the
breaks.”
Who said this?

as well just turn back, keep right on going.”
