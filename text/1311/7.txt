‘The truth will come out one day’
Former Imperial College student and staff member Babar Ahmad is imprisoned under
terrorism legislation, awaiting extradition to the US. Today, he writes exclusively for Felix
I read with interest Felix’s coverage
of my case and the dramatic meet-
ings that were held to campaign for
my justice. I would like to begin by
offering my heartfelt gratitude to
all those who have and are still sup-
porting me, especially those who do
not even know me personally.
Some of you raised concerns that
you did not want to get involved with
the campaign because it was ‘too
political’. On the one hand, one could
argue that campaigning against stu-
dent top-up fees is also political,
because it does not directly con-
cern Imperial’s students of today
– it concerns future generations of
undergraduates. The good nature
of human conscience dictates that
we will always wish better for our
future generations than what we
had ourselves.
On the other hand, I don’t really
blame you for not wishing to support
my campaign. I mean, who would
want to support someone who could
be planning to blow you to bits or
someone who is, as on The London
Evening Standard’s front page of 7
October 2004, “Bin Laden’s London
General”?
You see, not very long ago, I
was like you. When I saw dozens
of Muslims (mainly North Africans
and asylum seekers) being rounded
up in Britain post 9/11, I myself was
reluctant to campaign for them. I
thought: “There is no smoke without
fire. Maybe these people did have
explosives and terrorist plans. The
police don’t just lock people up for
nothing. I mean, how come it hasn’t
happened to me?”
And then it happened to me.
I saw for myself the ‘fire’ upon
which the smoke of my arrest was
based: my father’s 1973 tourist bro-
chure of the Empire State Building,
a 9/11 documentary DVD that was
screened on national TV, and other
‘evidence’. However, none of this
should come as a surprise to any-
one. After all, we live in an era where
countries go to war, destroy homes,
create orphans and kill thousands of
people, based on reasons that turn
out to be lies. Do you think that it is
beyond such people to imprison a
handful of individuals based on lies?
They are capable of anything.
Having now spent five months in
prison, I am trying to make use
of my time. I don’t have a guilty
conscience weighing on my mind
like other prisoners have, simply
because I know, and God knows,
that I am not a terrorist and that I
have not done anything wrong or
illegal. That is what matters to me
more than what others think. And I
will have my day, for sure, no doubt
about it. There is a saying in the
East that “the tongue of a lie is very
long, but its lifespan is short”. The
lie of the weapons of mass destruc-
tion in Iraq eventually came out,
albeit a few years on. Likewise, the
truth will come out one day, and
the liars and the hypocrites will be
exposed.
There is nothing wrong if you do
not wish to support my campaign,
because you are entitled to your
own views. However, I would hum-
bly request you not to prevent those
who wish to campaign for my plight
from doing so. After all, they could
turn out to be in the right and the
truth could turn out to be on their
side.

BABAR AHMAD
On 25 January 1885, General
Charles G Gordon completed his
final diary entry, poured his last gin
and tonic and strolled across the
balcony of the palace of Khartoum.
Stretching out in front of him, the
great city of the Nile had been over-
run by Madhists. His dream of a
great Saharan kingdom for Queen
Victoria was in tatters: Britain was
losing the Sudan. His incarceration
nearly over, the general loaded his
pistol and turned to face the door:
“Bloody dervishes,” he muttered.
It took a few years for Gordon’s
‘murder’ to be avenged, and 14
years in total before Sudan officially
became a British colony. As the cul-
mination of the scramble for Africa,
the race for the Sudan became a
matter of national pride, frequently
occupying the front pages of the
European newspapers at the time.
Britain got there first, Sudan turned
from white to pink on the politi-
cal map, and a disgruntled France
was given help colonising Morocco
to stop her whingeing. A Franco-
English war was only narrowly
avoided, and within a few years the
Entente Cordiale was signed.
Today, interest in Sudan is low.
This is despite what, according to
the UN, is one of “the world’s great-
est humanitarian disasters” hap-
pening within its borders. Perhaps
it is because its vast sands turned
out to be resource poor and its cur-
rent exports to the west are insig-
nificant. The US and Europe delay
intervention and sanctions while
an estimated one million refugees
struggle to survive famine and dis-
ease. As news of the Sudan crisis
slips from the press, it appears that
ethnic cleansing does not shock
us as much when it happens to
Africans.
A sincere-looking Jack Straw
appeared on BBC News over a
month ago to express his “extreme
concern” at recent events in the
region, but the Foreign Secretary
has not done anything to improve
the situation since. Yet, the arriv-
al of the new year must galvanise
action.
On 1 January 2005, Britain took
over the presidency of the G8 indus-
trial nations for 12 months – what
will be “a make or break year for
development” according to the
Chancellor. Britain has an opportu-
nity to use this position to increase
the foreign aid given to developing
countries by the other G8 nations.
For years, Sudan has been a for-
gotten slab of Africa, an arbitrar-
ily drawn shape conjured up in a
European office, its straight-line
international borders a sad relic of
its colonial past and the General
Gordons of the 19th century.
Relatively poor in resources,
Sudan serves little use to the West,
and the genocide of its people
apparently does not merit military
intervention. The West claims that it
has learnt from Rwanda, but it must
not sweep Sudan under the same
African carpet.
Britain’s leadership of the G8
group provides a real chance to
assist a continent it helped to carve
up and exploit, and it should start by
seriously addressing the Sudan cri-
sis. It is our government’s responsi-
bility to make the most of this oppor-
tunity. Only then can we begin to
heal this ‘scar on our conscience’.
Humanitarian crisis in Sudan
Following ethnic cleansing, millions of Sudanese people suffer from famine and disease.

Room bookings
Dear Editor,
I would like to bring up the sad and
sorry state of the room bookings in
the Union this term. Also last term.
In fact, most of the time.
I am directing this year’s pan-
tomime, and with my brave band
of actors I struggle through our
script in various rooms across the
College.
Last term, I was cramming 25-
30 people into rooms in the Royal
School of Mines building, because
the Union could offer me nothing,
even with plenty of warning. This
term, I booked as soon as it is pos-
sible, to find not only that exter-
nal people have the places before
we, students of the union, can book
them, but also I can be offered barely
any space at all. Seminar Room 2 for
30 people? Who are trying to act?
This situation would be OK if the
Union was full to bursting, in fact
I would have been grateful for a
room that everyone could find eas-
ily. But what do I find on Thursday
night? dB’s and the UCH are both
totally empty! Had I not thought of
looking around the building briefly,
my merry band would have been
on each others laps while the two
venues with lots of space and proper
stages were locked and silent. Does
this sound wrong to anyone?
A Disgruntled Director
Exam anguish
The two-week holiday was partic-
ularly short this year, and many
representatives and ordinary stu-
dents raised this with me last term.
However, for various logistical rea-
sons, the term dates are provision-
ally set ten years in advance by
the Academic Registrar, and con-
firmed by Senate (the College’s sov-
ereign academic body) two years in
advance. Therefore, whilst it was
particularly unfortunate that this
impacted badly on those with exams
or coursework deadlines, there was
nothing that could be done about
the length of the vacation at such
short notice. However, thanks to the
vigilance and persistence of fourth
year Aeronautics students, the
department agreed to put back the
exams by two days, allowing a little
extra revision time. As with all these
things, the sooner a potential prob-
lem is brought to my (or one of my
reps’) attention, the more likely it is
that we will be able to change it.

Babar Ahmad
Dear Editor,
Correction: Babar was still a mem-
ber of staff when he was arrested
on Exhibiton Road having just left
his workplace, Imperial College. It
seems that some have been read-
ing the inaccurate reports by media
outlets that follow the notion of
“guilty until proven innocent” when
it comes to terror arrests etc.
Yes there are several organisa-
tions that are standing by Babar in
his fight for justice. However, per-
haps if Babar Ahmad was your rela-
tive or close friend you would think
differently and try to rally all the
support you could get.
This campaign is not just about
Babar, it is about gross abuse of
our basic human rights and civil
liberties. In the name of this War on
Terror, the government is bending
all the rules and demolishing the
foundations of this very democracy
we fought so hard to get. This is a
matter that affects all the citizens
of this country, students and non-
students. There is life beyond IC for
its students.
I suggest you first read his side of
the story on www.freebabarahmad.
com. Also, there is going to be a doc-
umentary about Babar’s campaign
on Wednesday 26 January, 10pm,
BBC2. It is important to look at both
sides of every story before we judge
anything.
Zara
Dear Editor,
I believe that the Union represents
only the existing students of the
College. There are other groups that
can campaign for that person [Babar
Ahmad]. People who are interested
on that case can form a group and
campaign on their own.
