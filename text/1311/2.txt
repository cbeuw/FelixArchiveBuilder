The City and Guilds office,
having become the headquar-
ters for Imperial students’
tsunami appeal, is resonating
with the sound of our brand
new coin counting contrap-
tion.
As I write, RAG chair Chris
Jackson has just announced
the arrival of 32 more tins
full of money. The students
and staff at Imperial College
have come out in full force
to support this venture. The
medics have had a bar night
at the Reynolds, and all clubs
and societies have taken it
upon themselves to collect as
much money as they can, at
the same time raising their
own profile.
Islamic Society has appar-
ently raised about £700 in a
single meeting, and the Sri
Lanka and Tamil societies
have been involved in cross-
campus collections along
with the Thai and Malaysian
societies.
At the moment, more than
a 120 tins are in circulation in
and around College, in halls of
residence and bars. To date,
we have collected £2591.49.
So if you see a tin, empty
your pockets, please! This is
a catastrophe that needs a
sustained effort and is more
than just the flavour of the
season.
To all those directly involved
in the collection, you are doing
a worthy service and should
continue your efforts.
If anyone else wants to
get involved, contact RAG
(rag@ic.ac.uk) or walk into
the City & Guilds office, room
340 in mechanical engineer-
ing, and take a collecting tin.
For those who have tins, it
might be a good idea to return
them any time this week.
We need volunteers to get
involved and to continue
raising money. More oppor-
tunities will arise in RAG
Week, scheduled from 7 to 11
February. Get involved!
Students raise thousands
for tsunami appeal
Make the College
contribute
By Colin Smith
Imperial College Union
Welfare Campaigns Officer
The generosity from ordi-
nary people all over Britain
in response to the disastrous
effects of the Asian tsunami
has been remarkable, with
many millions of pounds hav-
ing already been donated. In
stark contrast, the current
government figure still only
stands at the equivalent of
five and a half days’ spending
on occupying Iraq.
There is a similar contrast
within Imperial College. The
response from students has
been fantastic, with the total
raised currently standing at
around £2500 and set to rise
further. In response to this,
a motion will be presented to
Union Council on Tuesday 18
January, resolving to do two
things.
Firstly, the paper will
demand that the College,
with all its money and spon-
sorship deals with oil and
pharmaceutical companies,
donates ten times the final
amount raised by students.
As it stands, that would be an
extra £25,000.
Secondly, it will demand
that our Rector, Sir Richard
Sykes, gives the same pro-
portion of his income to the
appeal as the students have.
The average donation from
students seems to be around
£2. Given that the non-
means-tested loan for home
students in London is £3,790
per year, and given that the 27
February 2004 issue of Felix
reported Sir Richard accept-
ing a pay rise to take his
annual salary to £251,000, he
would have to give approxi-
mately £126.
Anyone wishing to lend
their support to the motion
by seconding it should email
me at cs602@ic.ac.uk.
