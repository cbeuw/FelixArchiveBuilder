After last week’s rather long and
mostly quite pointless ramblings, I
thouught that it would only be fair if
I kept it shorter and to some sort of
point this week. The topic is Wagner,
and in particular the new Ring cycle
at the Royal Opera house... but you
may have already guessed that from
the headline.
There have been a number of
new Ring cycles around the world
recently, in fact the one at the Royal
Opera is in direct competition with
the English National Opera’s own
productions, the most troubled so
far being that for Bayreuth. For
those that don’t know, Bayreuth
is the annual Wagner festival in
Germany. Performances are held
in a specially designed theatre,
but unfortunately it is rumoured
to be somewhat uncomfortable.
Bayreuth, apart from being plagued
by an assortment of Wagner fam-
ily problems, suffered something of
a set-back when their director for
the planned 2006 Ring cycle quit
last year. However, a replacement
has just been found in the form
of the German playwright Tankred
Dorst.
Enough of other people’s prob-
lems; back to the Royal Opera. Last
night was the final night of the first
run of performances of the first
part of the Ring, Das Rheingold,
and as luck would have it disas-
ter struck. Things were even worse
than when Mutti pulled out of La
Forza del Destino earlier on in the
season. This time, Bryn Terfel lost
his voice, confirmed an hour before
performance. Terfel had been sing-
ing the role of Wotan, a rather cen-
tral role in the opera. Fortunately
the evening was rescued by the
chance appearance of Sir Donald
MacIntyre, a great Wotan of the
past, in town. So, the show did go
on, with MacIntyre singing from
the pit and Terfel miming on stage.
Not the ideal set-up, but this was
not the least of the production’s
problems.
The much-awaited new produc-
tion, directed by Keith Warner and
designed by Stefanos Lazaridis,
was something of a let down. The
opening sequence where the Rhine
Maidens taunt the dwarf Albrecht
worked well, but that was about it.
To match the sweeping music of
Wagner, one would expect equally
sumptuous sets, however, in the
age of stylised re-thinking, we were
presented with a black and white
nightmare. The palace of the gods
was barely approaching majestic,
and Nibelheim was just unpleas-
ant beyond words – a vile vision of
a morgue with lobotomised slaves
being electricuted, not to mention
the ridiculous box with shiny bits on
it that was meant to be the all-pow-
erful helmet with which Albrecht
was going to bring the world to
submission.
All I can do is hope that the next
installment, Die Walkure, is an
improvement, and that Bryn Terfel
will not lose his voice again, as I’d
actually like to hear his Wotan.
The Royal Academy is currently
hosting an exhibition of the work of
the British painter and printmaker
William Nicholson (1872–1949). The
exhibition closes very soon, on 23
January, and so if you want to see
what is actually a rather pleasant
exhibition you’d better get a move
on.
This is the first major review of
Nicholson’s work in London since
1942, when the artist was still alive.
The exhibition is comprised of 68
paintings and also includes more
than 50 prints as well as some of
the books he provided illustrations
for, including the classic by Margery
Williams, The Velveteen Rabbit, the
almost criminally sad children’s
book.
Now, while the illustrations in
The Velveteen Rabbit are beauti-
ful and touching, what one is most
likely to recognise of the works on
display are Nicholson’s prints, par-
ticularly if your family or any of your
friends’ families had a penchant
for Victoriana. The series of prints
for the artist’s The Alphabet (1898)
are the source of what are possibly
Nicholson’s most iconic images, not
to mention some rather amusing
examples for words beginning with
the letters of the alphabet: Y is for
Yokel.
The early part of Nicholson’s
career was spent as a printmak-
er and poster designer. In 1891,
Nicholson enrolled at the Académie
Julian in Paris, and while in Paris
he was to meet fellow artist James
Pryde with whom he collaborated
with under the name of Beggarstaff
Brothers, producing the design for
a series of posters. This was during
the time of the grand print revival
in Europe, led by the Frenchman
Toulouse Lautrec. Work from this
period in the exhibition includes the
Beggarstaff Brothers’ poster for
Don Quixote (1895) which is striking
in the simplicity of the design.
While Nicholson may be most
remembered for his prints and post-
ers, the exhibition does focus on his
paintings.
A wide range of paintings are
included in the exhibition, however,
his still-lifes are consistently his
best work. One begins to think that
the description of his landscapes
as ‘strikingly minimalist’ is some-
thing of a cover-up for some rather
uninspiring works, however, the still
lifes are magnificent in their use
of colour and texture as well as
the simplicity of their composition.
Portraits are also featured in the
exhibition, and from the selection
given it is clear that Nicholson had
a fabulous talent for capturing the
moment that was only in its nascent
stages as he was nearing the end
of his life. His paintings at the time
of World War I, though not strictly
portraits in a traditional sense, are
mesmerising.
The exhibition is compact, as is
usual for the Sackler Wing, but high-
ly recommended; the art is interest-
ing, and it is a small exhibition and
so one won’t be horribly worn out by
the culture (as you may well be by
the new exhibition to be held in the
Main Galleries, Turks).

● The Raphael exhibition at the
National Gallery will be closing this
Sunday. Tickets for this exhibiition

larly like queuing. Booking infor-

It might not strictly be pantomime
season any more, but Dramsoc
bring you a late festive treat with
their performance of Jack and the
Beanstalk next week. Normally at
this point in an article, it’s tradition-
al to give a brief resumé of the plot,
but frankly if you don’t know what
happens in Jack and the Beanstalk
you should probably be complain-
ing to your parents about having a
neglected childhood!
However, I guess there are a
few differences in this production
so here is a (very) basic storyline:
Jack and his mother are going to
be thrown out of their house by the
nasty Squire Macguire (boo hiss)
as they can’t pay the rent. In an
attempt to raise money, Jack takes
their cow to market and swaps it
with the evil Witch Whey for a bag of
beans (stupid boy!)
The beans turn out to be magic,
a mighty beanstalk grows and up
it climb Jack, his mother, the prin-
cess Penelope, a blind royal servant
called Stammers, Jack’s sister Jill
and her boyfriend (simple) Simon
(yes there is also a pieman, and pies,
many pies!)
At the top is a giant’s castle, home
to Mr and Mrs Giant (who aren’t very
giant), Captain Detergiant (evil cap-
tain of the giant’s guards who looks
quite a bit like Squire Macguire (boo
hiss!) and his evil henchmen (or
should that be man) Pungiant and
Stringiant (mutants that resemble
‘Two-bad’ from He-Man).
The evil captain then steals the
golden goose from the giants and
forces it to lay golden eggs by play-
ing with a harp. It’s up to Jack
to save the giants, save the goose
and harp (God only knows what
Dertergiant might do to them, he
is a very naughty man), save his
house, save his loyal cow Annabelle
and win the heart of the princess.
Will good triumph over evil? What
do you think?
Well there you go, you are probably
thinking, now I don’t need to come, I
can guess what happens! But you do
need to come, because this review
wasn’t very funny and the actual
pantomime is! There are some great
comedy moments (including some
wonderful ‘Imperial’ jokes), some
brilliant characters and people in
various animal costumes. Also, one
night, the actual author of this ver-
sion, an ex-Imperial student him-
self, is popping along, so you get to
see a man tearing out his hair as he
sees what we have done to his mas-
terpiece (at no extra cost!)
If you like saying ‘It’s behind you’
and ‘Oh no you didn’t’, and if you
enjoy seeing men dressed up and
women and women dressed up as
men (and lets face it, who doesn’t)
then there is definitely no better way
to spend an evening. In addition to
this, all the profits are going to the
Tsunami relief appeal, so by putting
yourself through a couple of hours
of mild pain you’ll be helping people
who are suffering far more.
Jack and the Beanstalk is on at the
Union Concert Hall from Wednesday
19 to Saturday 22 January, starting
at 7.30 each night. Tickets cost £4.50
for students or £6 others. Advance
bookings can be made at www.dram-
soc.org (book early to avoid disap-
pointment!). Any questions can be
directed at the director, Tom, whose
email is thomas.cafferkey@ic.ac.uk.
