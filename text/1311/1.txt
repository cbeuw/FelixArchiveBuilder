Students who work part time
for Imperial College have
suffered serious problems
receiving their pay in recent
months.
Despite opposition from
the Union, weekly pay was
scrapped last term, with the
College imposing a monthly
pay system on all student
staff. Proposed compensation
payments and cash advanc-
es have been slow in reach-
ing many workers suffering
financial hardship, while oth-
ers have been paid incorrect
amounts.
A considerable proportion
of Imperial students work
for the College part time, in
areas such as Conferences,
ICT, Southside bar and the
students’ union. For many,
the work is an essential part
of student life, without which
they would be unable to fund
their education.
Malcolm Aldridge, the
College’sFinancialController,
said that the change from
weekly to monthly pay had
been made for two main
reasons. Firstly, he said, “in
time, it will enable us to save
money on payroll processing”.
Secondly, “quite a large pro-
portion of the student labour
force are also recipients of
student bursaries”, which are
paid monthly, and there were
problems co-ordinating these
with weekly pay.
One student worker told
Felix: “If I needed money [in
the past], I could do some
work and have the money
in my pocket the next week.
Now I may have to wait six
weeks to get paid.”
Mr Aldridge responded:
“There are some places in
central London that would
pay you within days, but the
overwhelming majority of
employees in this country are
paid on a monthly cycle.”
Morten Olesen, an aero-
nautics student, recently quit
working in the Union bar. He
said: “The straw that broke
the camel’s back was the pay
issue. I didn’t see the point
in signing up for regular
shifts if I couldn’t expect reg-
ular pay.
“Although I do understand
it is much cheaper for the
College to run a monthly
scheme, they run the risk of
losing a lot more part time
student staff as a conse-
quence of this change.”
Mr Aldridge said: “If we had
serious difficulty in recruit-
ing, we would have to look at
this again... [but] large num-
bers of students still want to
work for the College.”
Another part time worker,
a chemistry undergraduate,
told Felix: “I was supposed
to be paid on a Thursday, but
on the Wednesday they sud-
denly told me I wouldn’t be
paid for three weeks. This job
is supposed to be tailored to
students. The people working
here have money problems,
and this is making things
even harder.”
Many employees who
worked in December will
not be paid for that month
until February. Mustafa Arif,
President of Imperial College
Union, said this was “unac-
ceptable” and offered cash
advances to his staff. Mr
Aldridge said: “I agree, it is
unreasonable,” and went on
to explain that this was due
to problems with the instal-
lation of new management
software.
Mr Arif outlined the Union’s
position: “The pay situation is
causing hardship for students
and headaches for manag-
ers. I think the College have
now accepted that there is a
problem, and I hope we can
resolve it quickly.”
He added: “The most gall-
ing aspect of this saga is that
whilst students have been
moved to monthly pay, non-
student casuals are still being
paid weekly.”
A number of student work-
ers have already told Felix
that they have not been paid
for several months. Others
have been given the wrong
amount. Some have also com-
plained about incorrect tax
deductions, a lack of com-
munication from the College
Finance department, insuffi-
cient amounts of compensa-
tion and a lack of advance
notice about the transition
from weekly to monthly pay.

Pay problems for student staff
Short on cash: this bar worker is just one of the hundreds of part time student staff at
Imperial College who have been affected by recent payroll problems
“The College run
the risk of losing
part time student
staff...”
