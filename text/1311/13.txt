Alexander the not so Great
Sadly, Stone’s ‘epic’ is a waste of time and money

One of the world’s greatest masters
of war, Alexander the Great con-
quered the ancient world before the
age of 30. So how amazing it must
be to have an epic that explains
the man behind this legend with
a cast list of Hollywood’s best and
Oscar-winning Oliver Stone as the
director.
The film follows Alexander all the
way through his life as his moth-
er Olympias (Angelina Jolie) fills
his head with stories of Achilles
and the siege of Troy, fuelling his
imagination and inspiring him
later on in his life to conquer and
drive his way through the east.
Olympias is determined to see him
achieve greatness and turn him
against his father King Philip of
Macedonia (Val Kilmer). After his
father is assassinated, Alexander
sets out to Persia in order to avenge
his death.
The film has some beautiful sets,
particularly for Persia – they are
stunning to look at and the fight
sequences, yes all two of them, are
very impressive. Be warned, though
– they do get quite bloody. If you
weren’t a fan of Kill Bill’s usage
of spurting blood and hacked off
limbs then perhaps this film isn’t
for you. Actually, I can also give you
several other reasons not to go and
see it.
How can I possibly start to tell you
how shockingly bad this film was?
The script was terrible. There was
no way for the audience to relate to
or care for any of the characters. I
left the cinema knowing nothing new
about this supposedly great man or
any of his reasons for conquering
the rest of the world. Frankly, at the
end of the film, I didn’t care.
The main point of the film seemed
to be that Alexander liked boys. Was
it really necessary to keep bringing
up his bisexuality? And if it was, why
was Hephaistion made out to look
like a lady boy walking around in
feminine robes when he was actual-
ly a skilled warrior and commander
in real life?
Relationships between men in
ancient Greece were very differ-
ent. They went through so much
together – there was an intimacy
that couldn’t be replicated with
women, who were there for sex, and
children. The film made it out to be
more sordid, and the sex scene with
Alexander’s ‘barbarian’ wife didn’t
really help, although the growling
and naked fighting may appeal to
some of you. The words ‘bouncing’
and ‘melons’ come to mind.
What Stone seems to have forgot-
ten is that Alexander had ambition
that was driven by figures such as
Achilles, Heracles and Dionysus.
His quest for glory and his need to
surpass his heroes was the reason
why he emerged as one of the great-
est military geniuses in history, not
because he had an over-bearing
mother.
The film is laughable. Jolie, Kilmer
and Leto do their best with what
they’ve got, but it’s not enough. Their
characters are two-dimensional and
they end up playing stereotypes; the
crazy snake-handling mother, the
drunken tyrannical father and the
effeminate lover.
And can anyone tell me why the
Greek have Irish accents? Colin
Farell sounds surprisingly less
Irish than the rest of the cast, apart
from the random Scottish guy who
wants us all to stop our belly-aching.
Confused? So am I.
Another area this film lets you
down in is the lack of battle scenes.
We never find out why Alexander
is still remembered today for his
strategic tactics. Important histori-
cal battles and major events in his
life, such as the trek back to Persia
through the desert, have been left
out. What makes this film even
worse is that Farrell doesn’t have
the right charisma (or acting skills)
to portray this icon – he makes him
out to be some sort of crazed wimp.
I’m not even going to go into the
brainless Matrix-like fight scene
between a horse and an elephant
– how moronic can you get? The
Saving Private Ryan style battle at
the end is equally terrible.
This film is so ridiculous that it
will have you laughing all the way
through, but something tells me that
wasn’t what Stone intended. Don’t go
and see this film. It’s a waste of your
time and money. Even the comedy
factor won’t help you endure three
hours of this self-indulgent movie.
