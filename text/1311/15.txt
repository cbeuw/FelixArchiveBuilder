Greetings, cruciverbovoracists!
We introduce some cross-referenc-
ing in clues this week (eg 10 across,
13 across, etc). The idea is that when-
ever a number appears in a clue, it
references the answer obtained by
solving the clue to be found at the
corresponding number (of course,
only if such a clue exists).
However, I am afraid some clues
came out more difficult than intend-
ed, so some tenacity will be neces-
sary. I have used Chambers (1998).
Good luck! Jabberwock

London Winter League
Matchday 3
By Ian Ballantyne
Christmas is a great time
for festivities... but not for
Ultimate. Two weeks of fris-
bee-lessturkeyandChristmas
pudding eating had slowed
Imperial’s Disc Doctors down
to a crawl.
Disc Doctors 13
Curve 7
Unsurprisingly, the first game
against Curve was a little on
the slow side. Everything was
in Imperial’s favour. There
was no wind, and the Curve
guys had even chosen to play
into the sun! Still, the Disc
Doctors (DD) went 2–0 down,
due to a couple of overhead
hucks.
No sooner had the Disc
Doctors put an end to the
overheads, the score began
to turn in their favour. A quick
comeback left the final score
at 13–7.
Dr PAF 9
Disc Doctors 5
Due to a last minute pull-out
in Division 3, a new pickup
team, ‘Dr PAF’, was formed
from PAF players, a few very
eager Americans, and our
very own Nathan and MadK.
Dr PAF fought harder than
shoppers at the January
sales, sending a couple of
quick upfield passes. They
had great organisation on
pitch, especially for a team
who don’t usually play togeth-
er. MadK scored a couple
against DD, almost losing
his ‘Committee Status’ in the
process (only kidding!)
DD had the opportuni-
ties, but, quite frustratingly,
dropped a number of end-
zone passes. There was one
very long point that seemed
to drag on for an eternity,
wearing everyone down. Not
even some fantastic hucks
from Jay and Stylish could
save DD.
It finished 9–5 to the PAF
folks, but the free massages
fromtheDrPAFplayersmade
DD’s efforts worthwhile!
Discuits 2 10
Disc Doctors 9
This game was likely to be
the toughest. Discuits 2 were
formidable opponents, jam-
packed full of experience and,
dare I say it, tall players!
They came straight at DD
with a zone, catching the
guys unaware. They blocked
a hammer to score the first
point, then two consecutive
points after that. A brilliant
flow of passes from Magic
to Kev to Stylish to Stas got
DD back in the game. With
Doctors’ discs flowing like
raging rivers, Discuits resort-
ed back to man marking to put
a plug in DD’s scoring spree.
When Discuits were 8–5 up,
they began to throw away a
number of discs, but as the
horn went at 10–8 to Discuits,
it was clear they had won.
In the true style of Ultimate,
the final point was played out
with just as much intensity,
even though the outcome of
the game had already been
decided. DD won the point
and the game finished 10–9.
The day ended with a sing-
song from Discuits, a game of
Kabaddi and a trip to the pub.
At this point, Nathan remind-
ed me that he actually won all
of his games, since he played
for Dr PAF for the last two.
Cheeky hucker!
ULTIMATE FRISBEE
Disc Doctors back in action
City & Guilds Men 1st 26
HAC Men’s 1st 5
By Andrew Towers
Cast in the phallus-like
shadow of the city’s erotic
gherkin, the mighty City and
Guilds rugby team played
their final match of the
autumn term. The opposi-
tion: the Honourable Artillery
Company.
Severely depleted through
injury, apathy and alcohol,
the C&G squad consisted of
14 men, two of whom had
been called out of retirement
to boost numbers. However,
upon arrival at arguably the
world’s most valuable rugby
pitch, it became appar-
ent that the HAC were also
struggling, with only 13 men
to avenge their 66-29 defeat
at the hands of a rampant
C&G team last year. Rugby
league style, the flankers
were dropped to accommo-
date these numbers. Their
lack of front row also meant
unopposed scrums.
The result of this was an
unusually open game, with
the HAC exposing gaps
around the fringes, and the
C&G backs exposing the
space out wide. With the
ageing Adrian “pretty fat
for a fast man” Lewis step-
ping in at 10, Mike “I love
Imperial too much to bother
graduating” Hicks deputis-
ing for our entire back row,
and Will “I had to cycle from
Croydon to get here” Green
kindly substituting for us,
an otherwise young and
sprightly C&G dominated
much of the first half with
some flowing moves and
direct running, coming
close to opening the scoring
on a number of occasions.
Although both teams man-
aged to cross the opponents’
line, the first half ended a
disappointing 0-0.
The good humour and fair
play disappeared quickly, as
the second half turned into
a scrappy, somewhat ill-tem-
pered affair. Late tackles,
sliding tackles, stamping and
even trash-talk crept into the
game. The referee only exac-
erbated things by allowing
much of the dangerous play
to continue throughout the
half.
However, the superior fit-
ness and skill of C&G start-
ed to make the difference,
resulting in a dubious try
for the prolific Matt Taylor
after some Zidane-like foot-
balling skills from the backs.
The powerful Mike Hicks
waltzed through the goal-
line defence to add to the
C&G lead, before fresher and
ladies’ favourite Luke Taylor
snatched his first try for the
club.
The C&G scoring was
wrapped up by an incisive
finish from the tenacious
Matt Bangor after some hard
work from Nathan Alliston.
The HAC managed a try dur-
ing this spell of scoring, but
never threatened to take
control of the game. With
Lewis contributing a respect-
able three out of four conver-
sions, the game ended 26-5
in favour of the Guildsmen.
Other notable performances
include that of debutant Neil
Turkington, whose “aggres-
sive” tackling kept much
of the HAC back line very
quiet for the duration of the
match.
This provided a satisfy-
ing end to an enjoyable
year which leaves the most
glamorous team in Imperial
unbeaten, and reigning
Sevens Champions (many
thanks to the Numanator,
and particularly to Alex
“he’s behind you” O’Rourke,
for all their help and hard
work). Plans for 2005 include
mini-tours to Oxford,
Cambridge and hopefully
Dublin!
