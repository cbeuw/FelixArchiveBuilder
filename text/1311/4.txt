Ask many and they will tell
you that tuberculosis (TB)
has come back. The sad truth
is that it never went away.
This disease has been kill-
ing us for thousands of years,
with evidence of TB being
found in Egyptian mum-
mies dated from 2400BC.
Thankfully, we are now a little
better equipped in our fight
against TB than our ances-
tors were, as in the last 50
years effective drugs and vac-
cines have been developed.
The 1970s saw Britain arro-
gantly believe that TB was no
longer a threat, but, since the
1980s, the disease has under-
gone a resurgence, both here
and abroad. In fact, the rate
of incidence in London has
increased so rapidly in the
last ten years that the city is
now the TB capital of Europe.
The TB burden of some North
London boroughs, such as
Hackney and Newham, is
equivalent to that of Russia,
China and Brazil – countries
that have some of the highest
rates in the world.
Around two million people
die of TB each year, making it
the biggest single infectious
disease killer in the world. The
World Health Organisation
(WHO) estimates that
every second, someone new
becomes infected. The causa-
tive agent of TB is a bacterium
called Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis, spread via inhalation
of droplets expelled when
an individual with the active
disease coughs or sneezes.
Some of the symptoms that
are seen in someone with an
active infection are coughing,
shortness of breath, fatigue,
weight loss and fever.
So how is it that despite the
best efforts of so many, the
world is still plagued by TB?
The problem is that this bac-
terium is a lot smarter than it
looks. As well as possessing
numerous methods to avoid
and subvert the host immune
system, it also knows when it
is not winning and can chose
to go into hiding. Somehow
the bacterium enters a per-
sistent state in which it does
not really do very much; it
just waits patiently for its
enemy, the immune system,
to become compromised.
Around one third of the
world’s population harbour
a latent TB infection. This
obviously represents a huge
reservoir of potentially infec-
tious bacteria and presents
a major obstacle to any effort
to eradicate the disease. It
would be invaluable if we
could develop drugs aimed at
these persistent bacteria and
effectively treat those with
latent infections.
Deteriorationoftheimmune
system can often trigger M
tuberculosis to make the tran-
sition from latent infection to
active TB. This weakening
can occur through ageing or,
increasingly more often, upon
infection with HIV.
Only 10% of those infected
with TB will go on to develop
the active form of the dis-
ease during their lifetime,
but this percentage increases
dramatically in those infected
with the HIV virus. In Africa,
HIV is the single most impor-
tant factor in the increase in
TB cases observed during
the last decade. TB and HIV
are a lethal combination, and
we cannot hope to beat one
without also attacking the
other. The huge number of
HIV cases in South and East
Asia has led to a huge pro-
portion of the total TB cases
being found in these coun-
tries alone.
It does not help that these
people are some of the poor-
est in the world, and the loss
of income associated with TB
infection can only increase
poverty in these communities.
Treating – and, more impor-
tantly, preventing – both of
these diseases is not exactly
easy for low income coun-
tries. African leaders recent-
ly called for more money for
the UN’s Global Fund, which
fights AIDS, TB and malaria.
An additional problem
with the control of TB is the
huge number of displaced
and needy migrants around
the world. This number was
estimated at 20 million dur-
ing 2003 and, according to
the WHO, as many as 50%
of these people could have
TB. These mobile populations
pose a problem for the treat-
ment of those infected. Poor
living conditions, such as
overcrowding, poor nutrition
and poor health care, lead to
the easy spread of the infec-
tious agent. This appears to
be at least part of the reason
behind the recent increase in
TB cases in London. Many
of the identified cases are
among immigrants born in
countries outside the UK,
leading to calls for the com-
pulsory screening of all those
planning to reside here. It is
a suggestion that has been
condemned as extremist, rac-
ist and unworkable by some.
Screening would most prob-
ably save lives and slow the
spread of TB, but whether
such a policy could ever be
successfully implemented is
debatable. Perhaps voluntary
screening at GP surgeries
and hospitals should be made
available to allow those at risk
to decide for themselves.
Even when TB sufferers
are identified and treated,
the next barrier to the fight
against this disease is the
current vaccines and treat-
ments available. The protec-
tion offered by the current
BCG vaccine varies greatly
throughout populations, and
while it is very good at pre-
venting serious childhood TB,
adults only have between 0
and 80% protection from the
more common pulmonary
TB. It comes as a surprise
to many that, despite receiv-
ing the BCG vaccination, they
are still at risk of catching
TB. Better education and
increased awareness would
at least lead to more indi-
viduals recognising the symp-
toms and receiving treatment
before the disease spreads
and infects more.
One of the most disturb-
ing trends associated with TB
today is the gradual increase
in drug resistant strains
across the world, leading to
the possibility that our cur-
rent methods of treatment
will someday become useless.
Drug resistance occurs as a
result of evolution. Within a
population of bacteria, there
will naturally be variants that
possess unusual qualities,
such as resistance to antibi-
otics. Treatment with an anti-
biotic does not itself cause
resistance, rather it selects
bacteria that are able to tol-
erate the drug and a ‘sur-
vival of the fittest’ scenario
results in resistant variants
multiplying to take over the
entire population. Multi-Drug
Resistant strains (MDR-TB)
cannot be treated by at least
the two most important anti-
TB drugs, Rifampicin and
Isoniazid. In response to this
problem, 2004 saw Latvia
and the WHO jointly open
Europe’s first centre to fight
the spread of MDR-TB.
The emergence of resistant
strains is partly as a result
of inadequate or incomplete
treatment of the disease. It
takes around nine months of
chemotherapy to completely
banish TB, and when many
feel better after just a few
months, they stop taking the
antibiotics. Furthermore,
in countries where anti-TB
drugs are not readily availa-
ble, expensive and incorrect-
ly used, complete treatment
of infected individuals does
not always occur.
The aid agency Médecins
San Frontières recently stat-
ed that drug resistant TB and
HIV pose major threats, and
they believe that inadequate
attempts to control the dis-
ease mean it is now spiralling
out of control. The charity
called for massive investment
in the development of new
diagnostic tests and drugs.
The problem of drug resist-
ance is not limited to TB. So
called ‘superbugs’ have been
well documented in the press,
with the public becoming
increasingly worried about
thehospital-associatedMRSA
infection. Again, this problem
is the result of incorrect use
of antibiotics, both in human
and veterinary medicine.
For many years, there was
a culture of taking antibiot-
ics for every cold we became
infected with. Doctors were
only too happy to prescribe
antibiotics, despite the fact
that viral infections do not
respond to antibiotic treat-
ment and this course of action
only results in the strength-
ening of potentially infectious
bacterial populations present
in the patient. Doctors have
now cut down on the number
of prescriptions they write;
unfortunately it is too late to
prevent the emergence of a
number of drug resistant bac-
terial strains that are much
harder to treat.
Treating drug resistant
TB takes much longer than
treatment of the non-resist-
ant strains, and the drugs
are significantly more expen-
sive. Once the drug resist-
ant strains have emerged,
they are spread through
the air as for non-resistant
TB. More and more of the
newly detected infections
involve these new variants.
Therefore, detection of drug
resistance is important in the
fight against TB as it allows
the cocktail of drugs used to
treat these infections to be
varied as resistance is detect-
ed. However, in some seri-
ous MDR-TB cases, antibiotic
treatment becomes intoler-
able and surgery presents a
better alternative. The early
20th century saw removal
of parts of the infected lung
as the only resort for seri-
ously ill TB patients, and it
is extremely worrying that
the situation today sees us
desparately moving back
towards this somewhat bar-
baric method of treatment.
Rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB
can prevent further people
being infected by the suffer-
ers, hopefully slowing the
spread of these strains.
Prevention is better than
cure when considering drug
resistant TB, and worldwide
TB control is important. The
DOTS (Directly Observed
Treatment Short course) pro-
gramme, implemented by the
WHO, is an internationally
recognised approach to TB
control. It involves govern-
ment commitment to TB con-
trol, better detection of those
infected, treatment with high
quality drugs, recording and
reporting of cases, and super-
vised taking of the chemo-
therapy for at least the first
two months of treatment.
However, a recent Nature
Medicine paper used math-
ematical modelling to sug-
gest that MDR-TB will in
the future become a major
public health threat despite
the current attempts at con-
trol. Their argument was that
despite the lower fitness of
many MDR-TB strains com-
pared with the fitter non-
resistant strains, the rare
emergence of relatively fit
MDR-TB strains would be
enough to allow these bacte-
ria to eventually out compete
the less fit MDR-TB and non-
resistant populations. This
is obviously an extremely
worrying prospect, making
the development of new and
more effective drugs and vac-
cines vital.
It appears that drug resist-
ance, HIV and poverty have
all played a role in the current
TB situation. I personally am
amazed by this bacterium that
has survived among humans
for thousands of years, but
when you consider the 16 mil-
lion people worldwide with
active disease, and the one to
two billion with a latent infec-
tion, eradication of TB cannot
come too soon. For the time
being, however, it appears
that TB is here to stay.
“TB and HIV are a
lethal combination, and
we cannot hope to beat
one without also
attacking the other.”
TB or not TB: is this a global epidemic?
Tuberculosis: 1-2 billion people have the latent infection, 14 million have the active
disease, and around 2 million die from it every year

“One of the most
disturbing trends
associated with TB
today is the gradual
increase in drug
resistant strains...”
“...the situation today
sees us desparately
moving back towards
this somewhat barbaric
method of treatment.”
