CLUB REVIEW
Fabric is one of those places you real-
ly can’t have missed. Whether you’re
a clubber or not, you’ll no doubt have
seen or been handed their stylishly
designed monthly flyers in record
shops, on leaving clubs, gigs or bars,
and even around College.
With three rooms, each easily big
enough to be a venue in its own
right, and a capacity of 3000, the
place attracts an astounding array
of well known and very good DJs.
It consistently offers a quality night
out.
For many people, Fabric is where
they popped their clubber’s cherry.
For some, it’s epitomises the club-
bing experience. I know people who
rarely, if ever, go elsewhere. It’s also
a bit of a tourist attraction, and why
not? I would advise anyone to go,
even out of idle curiosity.
There really is a lot to love about
the place, but personally it’s the
variety that keeps me coming back.
On any given night you’ll find dis-
tinct and sometimes very different
music in each of the rooms, and even
more of a mixture in the crowd itself.
There are first-timers alongside reg-
ulars and ageing old-school ravers,
Londoners and people visiting from
the provinces as well as tourists
from further afield.
Normally I’d go for house nights,
but tonight I’d come to check out
some hip hop. Of course, since it’s
Fabric, there was also drum and
bass in room 2 and electro in room
3. The line ups were, as ever, mouth-
watering, including Craze (two sets
– one hip hop, one drum and bass)
Scratch Perverts, The Herbaliser,
Klashnekoff, Tigerstyles, Dillinja &
Lemon D, and Bones and Ramsey.
Arriving pretty early, our first port
of call was room 2, where the drums
and bass were already in full effect.
Now, I do like drum and bass, but
when confronted with a heaving
mass of bodies as we found, I tend to
wimp out and head for somewhere
with a bit more space. At least until
I’ve found my dancing feet, anyway.
So we continued through to room
1 where we found The Herbaliser
behind the decks.
These guys are the pride of Ninja
Tune, representing UK hip hop.
Given this, the scene before us was
something of a disappointment. The
room was pretty empty, and whilst
this was partly due to the early hour,
the music wasn’t really helping. I
admit I’m not a hip hop afficionado,
and I’m used to being impressed at
Fabric. Maybe I’m spoiled, but this
just didn’t seem to be cutting the
mustard. In a city where there is a
lot of ‘bling’ around, any DJ playing
R‘n’B, soul or hip hop needs to stand
out, or at least make the grade. I
love their music, but these guys just
sounded generic and bland.
And so onwards and upwards to
room 3. This is the smallest of the
three, but it has its own sense of
intimacy as the DJ booth is at the
same level as the dancefloor, so
you can check out the jock’s skills
whilst enjoying the sounds. Hoxton’s
Bones and Ramsey were pumping
out some electro beats, and this was
really doing the trick. After a while
spent vegged out on a sofa, indulg-
ing in some people-watching, my
feet were itching. A few vodka shots
later, and we were all quite happily
wiggling around the room, which
was nicely full – enough people for
an atmosphere, but not so many that
you had to watch where your arms
were swinging.
After an hour or so, we headed
back to room 2, and this time I was
a lot more impressed. Now the stage
was filled with many decks and mix-
ers, with a similar amount of DJs
and MCs. We saw Desi collective
Tigerstyles, and another crew that
I can’t name, but, to coin a phrase,
this shit was heavy. There were
fusing hip hop beats, double-speed
drum and bass breaks and all man-
ner of bass and scratch sounds, with
a good smattering of to-the-point
rhymes. Now the room was full, and
bumping – just the way it should be.
Aside from Herbaliser’s uninspir-
ing performance, there were only
a couple of things wrong with this
night. Sadly, Klashnekoff was a
no-show, but in his place the MCs
organised an impromtu beatbox
competition, pulling two contestants
from the audience. This was actu-
ally quite enjoyable – these guys had
some serious oral dexterity. As the
MC put it: “If he can beatbox like
that, what’s he gonna be like with
the ladies...?”
The only other let-down was
myself – Fridays can be a bit hectic
if you’re tired from a hard week. I
was, and had to quit and go home at
2am, missing headliners the Scratch
Perverts. I think I may finally be get-
ting old. Simon Clark
