US deficit dips further
As the US current account deficit reaches record levels, Numaan
Chaudhry explains why it may not be such a bad thing after all
A lot of the papers seem to
talk about the US current
account deficit with great
emotions and anxiety. But the
fact is, over a quarter of that
deficit is as a result of US-
based companies operating
in countries abroad.
True, the US seems to
have an insatiable appetite
for imports and currently has
a particularly low savings
rate. US policy-makers have
considered many options to
counter this, including giv-
ing tax breaks for exporters
to make their products more
competitive in a global mar-
ketplace, renegotiating bilat-
eral trade agreements to sup-
press trade barriers, pushing
for the Chinese government
to let the market dictate the
price of the Yuan and limit-
ing imports, especially oil and
gas, by instigating energy-
saving programmes.
But the benefits of US com-
panies operating outside of
their home market are tre-
mendous, including creating
enormous values for consum-
ers, corporations and share-
holders.
Today, nearly 25% of US
multinational profits come
from foreign subsidiaries.
This adds roughly $2.7 tril-
lion dollars to their market
capitalisation, bringing great
benefits to shareholders,
the vast majority of whom
are household consum-
ers. Expanding into foreign
markets and restructuring
operations internationally
can make multinationals
more productive and more
competitive, which would in
turn allow corporations to
offer consumers lower prices
and better quality and, in the
long run, add jobs at home.
This last step is achieved
because multinationals will
have greater funds to invest
in development opportuni-
ties, and for this, recruiting
will be inevitable.
This trade between foreign
affiliates, offshore subsidiar-
ies of US-based corporations,
and US companies and con-
sumers will grow in the years
to come as companies con-
tinue to expand their global
sales, production and sourc-
ing operations into emerging
markets.
Any negative net impact
on the trade balance must
therefore be weighed against
the economic value created
from these activities. It’s very
simplistic to assert that the
record-breaking US current
account deficit is an indicator
of a weak economy. Critics of
the US deficit need to take a
global, rather than a national,
view. They should consider
what is necessary for a pros-
perous economy rather than
one that is heavily indebted.
Among these, the Fiscal
deficit does need to shrink
to ensure that the US con-
tinues to be a magnet for
global investment and that
the dollar remains a favoured
currency. Tax and regulatory
policies need to be better
co-ordinated across nations
so investment decisions are
made on grounds of econom-
ic efficiency.
The US current account
has been consistently in def-
icit since 1982. Since 1998,
however, it’s growth has rock-
eted and has reached levels
unseen before, when looked
at as a percentage of GDP
,
exceeding 5%.
One problem with the way
the current account deficit
is measured, however, is that
it measures just the physi-
cal movement of goods either
side of the market, regard-
less of the nationality or own-
ership of either party. This
can cause serious mispercep-
tions as demonstrated by the
next example.
When Ford produces it’s
vehicles in Mexico, many are
sold to Mexican consumers
and this generates income
and hence profits for the
economy. But an excess of
vehicles are made so that
they can be shipped back to
the US. See the problem?
Even though they are pro-
duced by a US firm, they are
counted as imports.
At the same time, foreign
companies such as Toyota
and BMW produce goods in
the US and some of these
are sent abroad to Canada
and the links. These are then
counted as exports and we
end up with a very intricate
web of global firms ‘import-
ing’ and ‘exporting’ to the
US.
In theory, a current account
deficit should adjust itself
through exchange rates. In
this case, a deficit causes the
value of the dollar to decline,
stimulates exports and
reduced imports. However,
the US current account defi-
cit has shown no sign of cor-
recting in the past 2 decades,
even with the dollar’s decline
over the past two years.
In the first quarter of 2004,
for example, the deficit was
20% higher than in early 2003.
Many theories are conjured
up as to the reason behind
this tumbling deficit; but
the main possible reasons
include foreign government
intervention, problems in US
trade agreements, and the
rise of multinational organi-
sations.
Manyeconomistsagreethat
the US trade deficit is unsus-
taniable and that adjustment,
when it does occur, could
be painful. Since the deficit
has been at large for over
a decade, Alan Greenspan,
head of the Federal Reserve,
is indeed concerned with
the matter and has issued
warnings himself. Although
he does not predict catastro-
phe now or in the future, the
inevitable adjustment might
come in a disruptive form.
One such disruption he out-
lines in a speech in Germany:
“Cumulative deficits, which
result in a marked decline of
a country’s net internation-
al investment position – as
is occurring in the United
States – raise more complex
issues.”
Basically, a trade deficit
needs to be supported by for-
eigners investing in the US.
If, for example, China sud-
denly became reluctant to do
so, the result could be either
a sharp rise in interest or a
fall in the dollar, which, judg-
ing by its current rate, could
make its value ridiculously
low.
Greenspan points to the
US government to tackle
the deficits in its finances as
one step towards recovery.
President Bush, as a result,
has said he plans to halve the
deficit in the government’s
finances. But it is evident
that the government will con-
tinue borrowing. One blatant
example of this is the signing
in November, by President
Bush, of a new law that will
allow his government to bor-
row further $800bn.

Dismal Morrison sales
Morrison, the UK’s fourth-
largest supermarket chain,
reported a poor 0.1% increase
in like-for-like sales over
the core Christmas period.
Despite the £3bn acquisition
of Safeway in 2003, Morrison
has seen profits fall and its
market share drop since then.
However, no profit warnings
were given and the group
said it was ‘on track’ to meet
its expectations for the year.
Store cards get beating
High interest rates and the
anti-competitive behaviour
of retailers was the focus of
attacksbytheUKCompetition
Commission directed at the
store card market. Over 90%
of this market is controlled by
just four organizations: GE
Consumer Finance, Creation
Financial Services, HSBC
and Argos. The commission
is angry with the fact that
store cards charge an aver-
age of ten percentage points
higher than standard credit
cards. The variation in APRs
can reach double digits. Some
of the most criticised are:
M&S 18.9%
Argos 25.9%
Habitat 29.0%
BHS 29.0%
UK gilt yields dip
As last December turned out
to be the worst Christmas
season for a decade, retail
sales on the whole fell 0.4%
year-on-year. This led two-
year gilts, the securest form
of bonds that mature in two
years, down 0.5 basis points at
4.35%. The Bank of England’s
monetary policy commit-
tee will have a meeting this
week regarding interest rates
specifically, but there’s little
chance of the cost of borrow-
ing decreasing. The current
level is 4.75%.
PS2 sales dive
Yet another consequence
of the poor Christmas sea-
son, Game reported a drop
of almost one fifth in sales
as compared to the same
time last year. Sony failing to
supply enough PS2s, cou-
pled with weak UK consumer
expenditure, led Game to
warn that annual sales in
2004 would be lower than in
2003. Sales should be better
by mid-2005.
US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan has warned that the deficit in US trade cannot be sustained indefinitely, even
though the current account looks set to do so
