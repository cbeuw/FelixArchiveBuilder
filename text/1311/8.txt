“It is with great pleasure that
we announce the date of the
57th Hyde Park Relays…”
When I was elected as the
2005 Hyde Park Relays chair,
I dreamt that I would be help-
ing to organise the biggest
and best road relay race yet
– sad I know, but humour
me, I’m a third year electrical
engineering student!
Speaking to some of my
mates, I found out one of
them had been elected first
team rugby captain; anoth-
er was now president of the
wakeboarding society.
“So what about you Pete,
have you been elected for
anything?” they asked. With a
big grin on my face, I proudly
told them that I was chair
of the Hyde Park Relays
Committee.
“Fantastic, well done,”
they’d say, “…er, what is it?!”
I couldn’t believe what I
was hearing. This is, after
all, Europe’s largest student
relay race we are talking
about!
What was going on? I came
to the conclusion, after much
thought I might add, that
either everybody I met was
just taking the mickey out
me (very possible), I’d been
elected to organise a race that
wasn’t the one I thought it
was, or nobody from Imperial
actually knew anything about
the Hyde Park Relays.
I decided to investigate why
this was and to try to remedy
the situation.
As the name might suggest,
this prestigious race takes
place on a traditional course
in the historic setting of Hyde
Park, London. Fantastic! Not
rocket science I know, but
at least I knew which park
we were talking about – the
one right next to Imperial
College.
Since its inception in 1949,
the race has provided the
opportunity for thousands of
students from across Europe
to compete in a friendly yet
competitive atmosphere.
Last year, we welcomed
teams from Poland, Holland,
Germany, France and Spain
as well as over 100 university
teams from across the United
Kingdom. In total there were
around 600 competitors who
ran – the men each running
three miles and the women
running two. Great! It was
the race I thought it was!
This left me with the
remaining two thoughts
– either people were hav-
ing a joke at my expense or
Imperial students really did
not know anything about the
event. Thinking of how I could
solve this one, I returned
to my electrical engineer-
ing department for lectures.
And then it hit me: what bet-
ter place to find out if I was
being mocked than speak to
students in my department
– everybody knows that EEE
students don’t have a sense
of humour between them, so
I could be quite sure that I
would get a serious answer. It
soon became clear that most
students had not heard of the
race.
So why do so few Imperial
students know about the Hyde
Park Relays? Why didn’t ACC
teams, departments or lec-
turers enter?
The answer is simple – we
have never asked you to take
part before! The cross-coun-
try club has always promot-
ed this event externally, but
never with any real convic-
tion, internally. Many of the
world’s greatest distance
runners have run this race
‘before they were famous’,
but hardly any of the greatest
Imperial students have.
Well, I still intend to make
this race the biggest and
best yet and I am asking you
Imperial students to help
me to do this by agreeing to
take part. The race, with its
start and changeover point
situated on the banks of the
Serpentine in Hyde Park,
is perfect for those of you
who love competition or sim-
ply just want to experience
racing in such a renowned
and beautiful location. So,
come on! Get yourselves a
team together and sign up
– departments, lecturers and
halls teams already have.
To encourage you guys to
put a team in, entry has been
slashed to half price – £12 for
a team of six men (or mixed)
and £9 for a team of four
women (payment by cheque
only). This includes the race
(obviously), some food, poten-
tial prizes if you do well (or
really badly) and the exclu-
sive after-race party, where
dBs is, for once, full of men
and women dancing away
until two in the morning.
The only problem is that
you will have to move fast.
Even though the race date is
Saturday 12 February, entries
officially close on 22 January.
To get an entry form, call
into the Student Activities
Centre in Beit Quad. For more
information, please visit the
official website, www.union.

I hope to see you all there
on race day!
HYDE PARK RELAYS
‘Imperial’s biggest sporting event?
I’ve never heard of it!’

On Thursday 20 January,
the Pinks will be holding an
evening to raise money for
Breast Cancer Care in dBs,
including an Ann Summers
party and Blind Date.
Pinks are a group of girls
at Imperial who got together
to form a social club. Pinks
is not an official Imperial
College Union club or society;
it is just a group of girls who
get together once a week to
have a chat and meet new
people.
Breast Cancer Care is the
UK’s leading provider of
information, practical assist-
ance and emotional support
for anyone affected by breast
cancer. Every year, they
reach over one million people
with breast cancer or breast
health concerns.
Breast cancer is the most
common cancer in women
– nearly one in three cancers
in women occur in the breast.
The lifetime risk is one in
nine, with 13,000 women dying
from breast cancer in the UK
in 2002. Only 5-10% of breast
cancers are hereditary or
due to family history, mean-
ing that increasing people’s
awareness of it is vital.
For these reasons, Pinks
decided to hold an event
at Imperial to raise money
for the Breast Cancer Care
charity. The partnership that
they have with Ann Summers
(10% of the sales are donated)
seemed to provide an excel-
lent opportunity to have an
evening at Imperial solely for
women. Although some peo-
ple may be offended by the
nature of an Ann Summers
party, it is Pinks’ opinion
that it will be an excellent
evening and a great novelty
for Imperial women.
The evening starts with a
talk from a Breast Cancer
Care representative at
7.00pm. This is followed by
the very strictly girls-only
Ann Summers party. Later
on, we are auctioning off
some of Imperial’s finest
bachelors and having our
very own Blind Date, also
to raise money for the char-
ity. Throughout the evening
the Pinks (easy to recognise
– look for fairy wings and pink
t-shirts) will be selling Breast
Cancer Care pins and taking
donations.
Tickets are £3 in advance
and £3.50 on the door, and
include entry to the raffle.
