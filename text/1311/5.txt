Licensed sex? Human rights violation
By William Gates
Bioengineering department
Following the birth of its
1.3 billionth inhabitant on
Thursday, China’s birth con-
trol measures are as neces-
sary as ever. Their policy of
‘one child per family’ has
already produced a reduc-
tion in birth rates, causing
the population of the country
to be an estimated 300 million
people short of what it would
have been had there been no
restriction. A population peak
of 1.46 billion is still expected
by 2035.
He stared nonchalantly at
his firstborn, a girl. Great,
he thought. Tick that box on
my license. Then hello life
of celibacy, life of chastity,
life of the incapacitating
vasectomy. He shuddered at
the thought. It would be any
minute now that the men in
the white coats would burst
violently into the room,
demanding his submission.
Because they, after all, will
be the ones holding the scal-
pel. Accidents do happen,
they will say. Play along and
we might just be extra care-
ful with you.
Did he just glimpse a shad-
ow?
“Don’t worry, honey,” his
wife ventured compassion-
ately. “You could always
wear a condom.”
A what?
“One of those relics?” he
snorted back. “They haven’t
been in use since the begin-
ning of the century. Get with
the times, woman!” Rage
and desperation were boiling
within him. Suddenly, the 36
hours of labour she had just
endured seemed to be unduly
truncated. Melancholically
he considered the irony of
‘unduly truncated’.
He handed back his dimin-
utive newborn, the symbol of
his woes, into the welcoming
arms of his wife.
OK, there was definitely a
shadow loitering outside the
door.
A flash of metal.
Yet this measure has had
far-reaching effects. Mothers
are increasingly likely to have
an abortion if their child is
female due to the desire for
a male heir, causing a pre-
dominantly male society to
develop. The restrictions also
mean that no child can have
brothers, sisters, cousins,
aunts or uncles, causing a
loss of family values in the
community. Also, the reduc-
tion in the mean number of
children per family will cre-
ate an ageing population with
fewer able-bodied people to
support it.
“This is the end of my life
as I know it,” he pleaded to
no-one in particular.
His wife misunderstood.
“What, having a daughter?”
she asked absurdly.
“No, never being able to
procreate again” her hus-
band retorted. “I know what
they’ll do. Come in here any
minute; drag me off for the
snip. Impotency will con-
sume the rest of my life! One
child and then that’s it! Your
license is revoked, no more
children, no more sex life.
Ever!”
His voice rose in pitch,
probably in premonition of
the fate that awaited him.
“They have no right! All
these childbirth controls, all
these limits. No wonder there
are so many prostitutes!
No wonder sexually trans-
mitted diseases are rife! No
wonder abortions are ram-
pant! No wonder there are
so many orphaned children,
abandoned by their parents
as they symbolise the true
extent of the restrictions
imposed upon them! Orwell
had it right! The death of the
orgasm!”
Yet perhaps the most dam-
aging aspect of birth control
is the infringement on human
rights. Is it fair to dictate to
a couple how many children
they are allowed to have? And
what of the future, when the
ever-increasing population
needs sterner restraints. Will
stricter childbirth policies be
introduced?
In his controversial and
emphatically prophetic
novel 1984, George Orwell
describes a totalitarian state
whereby the Party, the force
behind the ‘Big Brother’ slo-
gan, creates an environment
whereby sex is demonised
and hated, where family val-
ues are destroyed as children
are indoctrinated to become
completely subservient to the
Party, and love is annihilated
as an emotion. The motiva-
tion for the hate campaign
against these essentially
human tendencies is so that
everyone is entirely devoted
only to the Party, and this is
where all their desire is chan-
nelled. The drive is towards
a social system resembling
a bee hive, where all mem-
bers are only concerned with
the welfare of the queen and
ignore any desire of their
own.
At that moment four men,
two wearing white coats,
two wielding batons, erupted
into the room and swallowed
the new father up into a sea
of limbs and wood. He strug-
gled convulsively until one
of the doctors (he hoped they
were doctors) injected some-
thing into his neck. Instantly
he went limp. Unable to
protest either physically or
verbally, he was carried in
triumph into an adjoining
room, where the last rites of
his sex life were performed.
His wife, meanwhile,
drew her child closer to her.
“Well,” she said, “at least
now I might get some decent
nights’ sleep.”
Although I do not suggest
that China is on the verge of
totalitarianism, the similari-
ties exist, and should be con-
sidered a warning, allowing
us to avoid the unwitting path
to subservience and dicta-
torship of ideals. Other birth
control measures, such as
through education, hormone
manipulation and mechanical
barriers (such as condoms)
need to be introduced and, if
already present, more enthu-
siastically enforced so as to
avoid any violation of human
rights. Personally I believe
that it is education and
responsibility that will ‘solve
the problem’.
A nation of only children: China’s ‘one child per family’
policy has had far-reaching effects
News
in brief
US space shuttle
crew eager to
return to flight
Astronauts assigned to
NASA’s first space shut-
tle mission since the 2003
Columbia disaster said they
are confident mistakes and
technical problems that led
to that accident are in the
past. The launch is set for
mid-May and the crew are
scheduled to spend 13 days
in space on a test flight to
practice inspection proce-
dures and heat shield repair
techniques developed since
the Columbia accident.
German team
finds new way to
block HIV
replication
German scientists have
found a new way to prevent
the HIV virus from repli-
cating, offering hope in the
face of the virus’ increasing
resistance to existing drugs.
Joachim Hauber, a profes-
sor at the Heinrich-Pette
Institute in Hamburg, and
his team have identified a
protein in human cells that
the HIV virus uses to repro-
duce and have run tests on
a chemical that blocks this
protein’s action.
Swift catches first
cosmic blasts
The Swift space telescope,
launched in November, has
seen its first gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) – the mas-
sive cosmic explosions it was
built to study. The telescope
detected its first burst on 17
December, only a few days
after its instruments were
switched on. GRBs are the
most powerful explosions
in the Universe, releasing
more than one hundred bil-
lion times the energy our
Sun emits in a year.
Rats can tell
the difference
between human
languages
Rats can use the rhythm of
human language to tell the
difference between Dutch
and Japanese, research-
ers in Spain reported. Their
study suggests that mam-
mals evolved some of the
skills underlying the use and
development of language
long before language itself
evolved. It is the first time an
animal other than a human
or monkey has been shown
to have this skill.
Huygens Friday and the countdown to Titan
By Darius Nikbin
Science Editor
Stop everything you are doing
right now.
Launched on 14 October
1997,sixyearsontheHuygens
probe is set for its arrival
on Titan’s surface. With any
luck, we should be seeing the
first images and sounds from
Titan on Friday.
The probe will arrive at
Titan and dive into the atmos-
phere of Saturn’s largest
moon. ESA TV will provide
extensive live coverage of
this event, as detailed on the
right. All transmission and
satellite details are online at
http://television.esa.int.
Coverage should begin
from 8am on Friday morning
when the Huygens probe is
being switched on from the
state of hibernation it has
been in since it separated
from the Cassini mothership
on 24 December 2004.
At 9.06am, Huygens is
scheduled to enter Titan’s
atmosphere at a relatively
steep angle of 65 degrees and
a velocity of 6km per second.
The probe will then decela-
rate to 400 metres per sec-
ond within 3 minutes before
deploying a 2.6m pilot chute
at about 160km altitude. After
two and a half seconds, the
primary parachute will pull
away and the main 8.3m
diameter parachute will open
to stabilise the probe. From
this point on, Huygens will
be collecting information on
atmospheric composition
and dynamics. The data will
be transmitted to the Cassini
mothership which should be
flying over Titan at a distance
of 60,000km.
The descent will last two
hours 20 minutes before
Huygens impacts with the
surface of Titan at 6m per
second. If it survives all this,
Huygens will then have (at
most) 130 minutes to directly
characterise Titan’s surface
before its mission is over.
Although there is very lit-
tle chance that we will have
images of giant insects or
sounds of little green men
singing Fly Me To The Moon
into the on-board micro-
phones, any results will be
fascinating.
Titan is bigger than the
planet Mercury and slightly
smaller than Mars. It has a
thick hazy nitrogen-based
atmosphere containing
carbon-based compounds.
Scientists believe that the
similarities Titan bears with
the Earth in terms of its
atmosphere and composition
will yield some clues to help
them understand how life
emerges on planets.
British bookies Ladbrokes
had set starting odds of
10,000/1 that the mission
would find intelligent life on
Titan.
