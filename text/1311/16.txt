GKT Women’s 1st 5
Imperial Women’s 1st 25
By Scotch
We beat GKT!
For those of you who do
not follow women’s rugby, let
me put this is context for
you. GKT have been finalists
in the ULU Cup for the last
five years, are the reigning
league and cup champions,
and last year hammered us
98-0. We don’t like them very
much.
As always with the Virgins
(Imperial’s women’s rugby
team), there was much fun
to be had before we even got
to the ground. We shall spare
the blushes of everyone who
was in the van on the way to
the match, as we all revealed
rather too much about our-
selves. Suffice to say that
sex therapist DangerMouse
has a new project to work
on. She has decided to pass
up the challenging case of
Spandex, who asked if “To
be a serial monogamist, does
that mean you have to be
faithful?” Perhaps we should
have made her keep her old
bar name, Whore!
So, to the game itself. We
quickly rucked and mauled
our way up to their try line,
and from 5m out Gump took
the penalty to crash over for
a try. And then we did the
same again; this time prop
Wonkey was screaming “give
me the ball!” Try!
From a line out on their
22m, several phases of play
found Wonkey on the wing,
who selflessly passed the ball
to DangerMouse in the dead
ball area, and thus came our
token backs’ try of the game.
Thefinalfewminutesbefore
half time were hair-raising
to day the least. A succes-
sion of penalties were given
against us for not retreat-
ing 10m, and pretty soon we
were 30m back. GKT found
their winger, beat our guard
and then raced off down the
touchline. A brilliant tackle
by Tumbles saved us, forcing
the winger into touch as she
touched down.
At the start of the second
half, good hands from the
backs let DangerMouse loose
on the wing, who made up
half the pitch for us. This
passage of play finished with
Flipper nearly scoring, only
to have the ball knocked out
of her hands as she crossed
the line.
GKT opted to run the pen-
alty at the restart, but Gump
ripped the ball in the ensuing
maul, popped out the other
side and just kept on run-
ning.
Thanks to Joss’ fine ter-
ritorial kicking, we gained a
penalty on their line. One of
theirs feigned injury, mean-
while the ref gave Gump the
nod to take the quick tap and
score her third of the after-
noon, causing us to to briefly
consider the headline ‘How
Gump Gubbed GKT’.
In the final ten minutes,
things started to get rather
heated. Tempers flaired
– we’d had enough of their
pinching in the rucks, thank
you very much – and the ref
seemed determined to even
things up a bit. Wonkey was
sin binned (she was already
on a warning) for body-barg-
ing their tiny winger into
touch and was off for the
rest of the game. We were
back on our line, scrambling
defensively to cope with self-
inflicted bunching of defend-
ers and a seven-man scrum.
The referee erroneously
awarded a penalty try to GKT
for coming through the ruck.
Honourable mentions must
also go to twirly Easy, Beater
for playing musical forwards
throughout the game, Flipper
for coping particularly well
under pressure, and loadsa
trademark Spandex penalties
– she even managed to pass
the ball once, which really
confused them!
A dishonourable mention
goes to the ref, for being
the most sexist buffoon I’ve
encountered in five years of
playing. The awards went to
Killer and Gump (what a sur-
prise) for back and forward
of the match respectively.
Felix is the happiest captain
Imperial has ever seen, as we
are now top of ULU.
Celebrations continued
with a nice game of ‘19 plus
three’.
Finally, most importantly,
congratulations to Coach
Dave on the birth of Baby
