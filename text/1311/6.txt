I’m a zombie, get me out of here!
Apologies in advance if this week’s
column is a little random. The
Editor’s deadline to get copy to the
printers was 12 noon on Wednesday.
It is now 12.43pm and he is glaring
at me. I didn’t go to bed last night
(for the second time this week, so
far) because I was caught up with
work in the office. If, for some rea-
son, you are able to combine the
qualities Sam talks about below
with the sheer commitment and
drive required to do this on a regu-
lar basis, then I suggest you stand
for election as Union President.
Nominations do open next week
after all. You might want to re-read
my (allegedly scary) column from
this time last year to get a glimpse
of what you are in for...
HMV Discounts
Here is my response to a letter in
the 9 December issue of Felix. You’ll
be pleased to know that all Imperial
students are indeed able to get dis-
counts at HMV, without an NUS
card. In fact, HMV give us their own
discount cards every year to hand
out at Freshers Fair. If you are hav-
ing any problems, it’s because the
branch manager is simply a moron.
If you email the Union’s market-
ing manager, Penelope Parker
(p.parker@ic.ac.uk) you’ll find that
a quick email from her to HMV
head office will solve the problem.
Please remember to give Penelope
the details of the offending HMV
branch.
Student staff pay problems
I believe Felix is covering this issue
in detail on the front page. I think
the College recognise the problem
and it will get sorted out. My only
comment is that it’s disappointing
that the Union was not consulted
beforehand. Had we, as the repre-
sentative body of students, been
asked for our opinions, this could
have been prevented. Instead, the
College has created six months of
hardship and headaches for stu-
dents and managers alike.
Radical change
One of the hardest things to do
in any leadership position is to
engage in a meaningful change pro-
gramme. Imperial College Union
should be, first and foremost, the
representative body of students at
Imperial. The initial results of the
strategic review survey are very
clear – we are failing to engage the
vast majority of the membership.
This is untenable and things must
therefore change.
Inevitably there will be conflict
– and the machinations of student
politicians will spill over into the
pages of Felix. The thing to remem-
ber, however, is that conflict demon-
strates a willingness to challenge
deeply entrenched interests. Just
so long as everyone’s aims are
the same and it doesn’t all get too
petty...

THE UNION
The joy of... making a difference
Ever wanted to make a difference?
It is a common human trait that
we like to think we have made the
world a better place, having given a
worthwhile contribution to society.
Some might look for a labour-sav-
ing invention, while others seek the
cure to a debilitating disease. Many
have wished to spread peace and
happiness, while others still have
hoped to inspire the world by their
artistic contributions. It is a com-
mon driving force that most people
want to leave their mark on the
world.
Whilst few of us will probably have
the opportunity to make such world-
changing influences as this, there
are ways in which people can make
a difference to their local communi-
ties. In our community of Imperial
College, one of the networks that
holds many people together is
Imperial College Union. The Union
is the recognised voice of Imperial
students, and constantly strives to
improve the lot of our students and
look after their educational, sport-
ing, social, and welfare needs. In
short, the Union is more than just
a bar!
How about doing something that
will really help you stand out from
the crowd, learning practical skills
in a supportive, fun environment and
helping your fellow students along
the way? Have you thought about
becoming a sabbatical officer?
Elections to the five sabbatical
posts of the Imperial College Union
will be taking place in February and
this may just be the year for you to
make your mark. While it is undeni-
ably hard work, serving as a sabbati-
cal offers a unique opportunity to
develop skills and experiences that
will stand you in good stead what-
ever you choose to do in life.
As Deputy President (Finance &
Services) you would be responsi-
ble for the day-to-day running of
the Union’s finances and would get
to manage an annual turnover of
around £6 million. You also have a
say in the strategic planning of the
Union and are responsible for ensur-
ing that the services and facilities
that the Union provides meet the
students’ needs. If you don’t have
any previous financial knowledge,
don’t worry – the Union’s experi-
enced permanent staff are there to
help you out and teach you all you
need to know.
The Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) is responsible for the man-
agement of the Union’s many clubs
and societies, monitoring feedback
from clubs and working on strate-
gies to improve the service offered.
You will take responsibility for train-
ing and student development as well
as health and safety.
As Deputy President (Education
& Welfare), you would be responsi-
ble for the Union’s network of aca-
demic and welfare representatives,
the Union’s “eyes and ears on the
ground”. Using these representa-
tives, you would be involved in pro-
moting important welfare issues and
campaigns, as well as safe-guarding
the education of Imperial College
students.
As Felix Editor, in addition to edit-
ing the newspaper you will also be
responsible for its financial manage-
ment, which involves raising around
£30,000 in advertising revenues over
the course of the year. The day-
to-day editing involves everything
from trying to turn rather difficult
submissions into printable content
– this can be anything right the way
down to sports reports written on
the back of a fag packet – to image
manipulation and graphic design.
If you want a varied role that
presents a real challenge, you might
consider standing for President. As
the figurehead, you would not only
have ultimate responsibility for all
of the Union’s activities but would
also be the public face of the student
body. As a College Governor, you are
the only student who can be sued
or prosecuted (the Union is a £6
million organisation, for which you
have unlimited personal liability).
You have to balance this against the
breadth of the role, the celebrity sta-
tus and the support from hundreds
of staff and volunteers.
Former sabbaticals say they’ve
used their experiences at the Union
in all manner of ways. From help-
ing them start out on their chosen
career path to learning essential life
skills, it seems that nobody forgets
their sabbatical year.
Nominations open on Tuesday, 18
January at midday and close on
Tuesday 1 February at midday. For
further information, or to nominate
yourself, please visit www.union.
ic.ac.uk/elections. Voting will be
held online in mid-February – more
details on this will follow.
If you’re thinking of standing and
would like to find out what being
a sabbatical is really like, or need
any more information on each of
the posts, the current sabbati-
cals will be happy to speak to you.
Please contact Rebecca Coxhead
(r.coxhead@ic.ac.uk, 020 759 48060)
to arrange an appointment.
On a personal note, I think stand-
ing for a sabbatical position was one
of the best decisions I’ve taken, and
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time so
far. So if you’d like to make a differ-
ence to the lives of students, while
gaining valuable life skills, why not
stand for election?

Time to tighten the purse strings?
Well, I hope you all had a great holi-
day and enjoyed yourself. After all
the partying and over-indulgence of
Christmas, it is easy to forget about
the bills that are coming your way
after the festive period. Credit card
bills, accommodation fees, fuel bills
and tuition fees can all build up long
after Santa has left your chimney.
It is often easy to bury your head
in the sand and worry about these
issues when they come up after the
holiday, probably about now, but
what happens when you get these
bills and you actually cannot pay
them, no matter how much you try
to find the money?
One option in this situation is to
ask your bank to extend your over-
draft, but what happens if the smil-
ing bank manager says no?
When you find yourself in this situ-
ation, it is easy to forget that there
are people around who can help you.
One area of the College that can help
is the Student Finance Office. They
deal with the Access To Learning
Fund, which gives students amounts
of money up to £500. To find out if
you are eligible for this fund, please
contact the student support officer
at p.worley@ic.ac.uk.
If it gets to the point where you
are receiving letters from compa-
nies and they are demanding money,
then come to the Information and
Advice Centre. We can act on your
behalf to try to negotiate payment
plans for the bills. We do this by writ-
ing a letter from the centre to the
different companies that you owe
money to.
We can also work out what you can
actually afford to pay and negotiate
with this figure to the companies.
Basically, if you can’t pay, it is better
to let people know than to hope that
it will all go away. The Information
and Advice Centre can assist you
with this situation and help you to
come through the other side.
The Centre can also help you if you
cannot pay the College. Whether this
be tuition fees or accommodation
fees, we can advocate for you and try
to get the relevant people to either
give you more time to pay or negoti-
ate a payment plan.
I hope that this article has given
you some idea of the support avail-
able to you if you find yourself in
financial hardship. Remember: don’t
let your concern turn into a crisis.
Make The Information and Advice
Centre your one stop shop for all
welfare issues.

Centre is now in the East Wing base-
ment of Beit Quad. Open: 10am-6pm
