Non Sabbatical for
Felix to be elected
A motion proposing the election of a non-
sabbatical Felix editor will be put to the
Union General Meeting (UGM) on
Thursday 8th November. He or she will
work alongside a Print Unit Manager w h o
will arrange the printing of Felix and
outside print jobs. The editor will receive
an honorarium similar to that received by
the Presidents of C & G U , R C S U and
R S M U , equivalent to two terms' rent in
Southside.
This solution to the lack of a sabbatical
Felix editor was produced by an election

committee comprising the Executive
Committee and four others. The Union
Council has agreed to the motion being
put to the U G M but the College must
agree to the change in election
procedure. The running of a non-
sabbatical election when a sabbatical post
has not been filled is a departure from
the normal system.
If the motion is passed papers will go
up on the 12th, down on the 23rd. Voting
will be on the 3rd and 4th December.

A Cosmic Ray and Solar Particle detector,
part of which was built at Imperial, was
switched on by remote control on the
23rd October. It is aboard the space
probe Ulysses, more than 18 million k m
from Earth. T w o days later Imperial's
magnetometer was made operational by a
signal that took over a minute to reach
the probe.
The magnetometer is a highly sensitive
magnetic field detector, capable of
measuring fields up to a million times
weaker than the Earth's field. It will study
the large scale structure of magnetic field
lines in the heliosphere.
All of the observations of the sun's field
have so far been confined to the ecliptic
plane. The observations made with
instruments from Imperial College and the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory will provide
data to test the three dimensional models
proposed by theorists. This may help us
to understand the eleven year solar
activity cycle. Related to the Sun's
magnetic phenomena this is believed to
affect weather patterns on Earth.
Imperial's other instrument on board, a
set of two atomic particle detectors, will
measure fluxes in energetic protons
released from the sun in solar flares. The
instrument, part of a complex of detectors
provided by an international consortium
of scientific institutes, will investigate the
way in which the heliosphere, and in
particular the sun, can act as a highly
efficient particle accelerator.
Chaos
'Chaos in Biological Systems' will be
discussed by Professor R . M . May on
Thursday 7th November. The lecture will
be held at 1.15 in Physics Lecture
Theatre 1. E v e r y b o d y welcome.
Fire
Fire broke out in Bernard Sunley last
Monday w h e n a grill caught light. Chris
Donegan, a past warden of Bernard
Sunley, said that a student discovered the
fire and put out the flames with an
extinguisher. He said that there had been
a large amount of smoke produced which
set of the alarms at around midnight.
Mr Donegan said that the cooker
involved had been examined by the
College electrician and had been passed
as safe. It was n o w back in use.
Mr Donegan said that there had been a
good response' to the alarm. H e
commented that there had been a fire
alarm test only that morning at 8.00.
