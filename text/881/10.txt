International poet and scientist to visit IC
Science, Art, and Ethics
H o w long is now? Looking back it
seemed like ages of silence.
I was standing at the bar, a pint of
bitter comforting my sense of doing, as
thought about what I could say. He was
an artist, and the other a poet. They
looked at me. I said nothing. They
wanted me to speak. 1 had nothing to
say. H o w could I, a student scientist,
relate to their
ways of seeing
and doing.
Miroslav Holub
concludes the title
essay of his book
a metaphorical monument to the heroes
of science, in his short story Argonauts of
the Air.
Miroslav Holub is a scientist, in the true
Wellsian sense. He is a prolific writer of
poetry and essays, whilst researching into
immunology in Prague.
Is he an unusual mam? Undoubtedly. A s
Ted Hughes, poet Laureatte, has written
The Demension
of the Present
Moment and
other essays with
'In this sense, our
ego lasts three
seconds.
Everything else is
either hope or an
embarrassing
incident. Usually
both.'
M y
embarrassing
incident was a
feeling of two
worlds, the artist
and the scientist.
The world of the
creative
imagination and
personal
statement, and
that of the dry
repetitive
cramming,
measuring and
counting. Yet
does science
really destroy our
sense of wonder
and creativity,
whilst art
nurtures and
expresses it?
This is a
question that H.G.
Wells raised as a
student here. In the preface to the
student magazine he founded and edited
he writes down his expectations. He
expected scientists to be writers and
poets. Part of this vision of a creative
scientist was inspired by his lecturer, the
Dean of the College, Professor T . H .
Huxley. Wells was bitterly disappointed
and uses the destruction of the College as
Brief Reflection on test-tubes
Take
a piece of fire, a piece of water,
a piece of a rabbit or a piece of a tree,
or any piece of a human being,
mix it, shake it, stopper it up,
keep it warm, in the dark, in the light, refrigerated,
let it stand still for a while—yourselves far from still
but that's the real joke.
After a while
you look—and it's growing,
a little ocean, a little volcano,
a little tree, a little heart, a little brain,
so little you don't hear it lamenting
as it wants to get out,
but that's the real joke, not hearing it.
Then go
and record it, all dashes or
all crosses, some with exclamation-marks,
all noughts and all figures, some with
exclamation-marks,
and that's the real joke, in effect a test-tube
is a device for changing noughts
into exclamation-marks.
That's the real joke
which makes you forget for a while
that really you yourself are
In the test-tube.
'Miroslav Holub is one of the half dozen
most important poets writing anywhere'.
But is he an abberation? Is his
combination of science and art a freak
accident against the nature of these
subjects?
This is one among many questions that
Miroslav explores, questions about the
nature of our behaviour, what is a sane

person, ethics and science, disease and
society. His personal reflections give a
sense of excitement and wit whilst
travelling d o w n beautifully guided
pathways of discovery, full of unexpected
views and destinations. Y e t his grappling
with the relationship between truth and
meaning places at the heart of his work
this relationship between poetry and
science.
This is a
problem he will
be discussing on
Tuesday
November 13 at
1.15pm in the
Read Lecture
Theatre. It is a
unique and
exciting
opportunity to
listen to a man at
the forefront of
the explorations
of the creative
nature of science.
This event is part
of a nationwide
tour organised by
the National
Poetry Society.
His theme is
one that he
shares with the
late Jacob
Bronowski,
scientist,
broadcaster and
writer, whose
own explorations
of science took
him to the
concentration
camp at
Auschwitz where
his family died.
His response
illustrates the
importance of the
issues at stake.
Issues about the
subjects you are
studying, the way
they are taught, how you perceive them
and how you may approach work in
science.
Miroslav Holub may change your views
about science! He certainly raises
questions at Imperial that are sometimes
hard to find due to the silence, that Wells
also heard, of the cramming of science
training.
