FELIX
Hope you all enjoyed the gig on Friday
last, Spirit of Ecstacy—those of you who
came, tell your friends how to have a
good time. Once again any comments or
suggestions will be welcomed—see us
last week's but different bands, obviously
(you're not stupid, are you!!). W e have
the effervessent Muscle Shoal plus support
from the Cuckoos. The Muscle Shoal play
their annual show, well they have played
probably wouldn't believe me. So come
along and see for yourself. A s for the
Cuckoos—well the name speaks for itself.
The price is £2.00 in advance, SI with
ents cards and £2.50 on the door. Tickets
around or drop us a line in the Ents
pigeonhole, this applies to tonight's event
as well as all events.
Tonight, once again, is one of our
Lounge events. On a very similar vein to
every year since I've been here and they
are great. 1 could tell you about their
haunting melodies and excellent
harmonies these four lovable mop tops
from Moptop T o w n can generate but you
can be obtained from the Union Office or
from the friendly hands of the Ents kids.
Oh, by the way, tonight there is also the
great Ents disco in full effect and a bar
extension until 12 o'clock. See you there.
BJ, Ents Chair.
