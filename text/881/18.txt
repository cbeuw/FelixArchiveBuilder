Sooner or later, engineering
graduates have to make a decision
whether to stay dose to the
technology that fascinates them
and in which they have excelled so
far, or whether to move out into
management style functions which
are perceived often quite rightly to
be the most effective way up to the
top.
In Schlumberger
you don't have to
make such black
and white
decisions.
| MANUFACTURING
Schlumberger operates a policy of promotion from within which means that all senior managers (and we are talking about all
the way up to the chairman) have come up from the graduate engineer level. While providing unsurpassed management
opportunities for young engineers, our system of career development also means that employees are not pigeon holed or
likely to experience one way tickets to support functions. A typical career in Schlumberger will lead in and out of technical,
management, and support roles, broadening experience, providing a unique variety and building the strongest corporate
management potential of tomorrow.
And while we are
looking for the potential
m our recruits to benefit
from this philosophy,
we do not compromise
on engineering
expertise. Which is why
we are market leaders
in our four mainstream
activities and are
continuing to invest in
R&D with a commit-
ment and confidence
way beyond that of our
competitors.
The Oilfield Services half of the
Schlumberger group is recruiting
Field Engineers to work all over
the world in often isolated
conditions and with irregular hours
providing advice, expertise and
specialised technical services to
our clients. Such assignments
require a high degree of initiative
and give a huge amount of early
responsibility. These field jobs
lead after a period to management
and staff positions. Moves are
regular and development and
training never stop

Schlumberger
The industrial half of the business comprises nine
autonomous business units designing, developing and
manufacturing a range of very high quality products
using state-ot-the-art facilities. Our engineers work in
small project teams that enjoy a great deal of
operational independence. Graduates go straight into a
productive role in such a team with training tailored to
the individual by means of relevant courses. Careers
may be developed in R&D, Production. Purchasing.
Sales. Client Support to name but a few. In our
relatively small business units, your achievements are
quickly noticed and rapid career development will
include movement between sites, across disciplines
and overseas
