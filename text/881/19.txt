Manager's Bit
Massive Typo!
I bow my head in shame for the
inclusion this week of a humungous
typographical error. O n the back page in
big letters, the U G M is advertised as
happening on Tuesday 8 November. It
should of course read Thursday, before
you sharp eyed devils write me lots of
letters on the matter. Also contained in
this issue is another typo of some
considerable amusement (well I thought it
was funny). No prizes but a pat on the
back if you can spot it...and a slagging if
you find and tell me of a really mundane
one.
ULU G U C
With their usual style and panache ICU
travelled to the U L U General Council this
week with various matters, heckles and
witty retorts in mind.
I was amused to hear of the verbal
tackling of the U L U V P (Services),
Desmond Quilty . W h e n speaking about
the U L U A l l - N i g h t e r , he was asked by
Benjamin Turner about the size of the
loss made on the night. Quick as a flash
FELIX is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College
SW7 2BB (Tel: 071-225 8672). Manager: Chris Stapleton,
he returned the sharp b l o w of 'about two
grand less than yours did!' Not
overwhelmed by this apparent defeat,
Benjamin went on two consolidate his
stand by interrogating the V P further.
Regarding the event he tightened the
thumb screws and asked w h y the matter
had not been included in his written
report. He was told that the report had
been printed before the matter had been
discussed by the Exec. W h y then, Benj
continued, had he not added it as a
verbal report. Desmond had no good
acerbic response to that one! and was
instructed that he should bring the matter
up at the next meeting. Nice one
Benjamin.
Box Ads and Collators
If anyone wishes to place box ads in
F E L I X they are most welcome to do so.
The arrangement is for the respective
people to organise some help for the
Thursday night collation of FELIX.
Alternatively the group can pay for the
advertisment or simply settle for a free
Small A d or What's O n inclusion.
Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Imperial
Business Manager: Jeremy Burnell, Advertising Manager:
A box ad was put in last weeks issue
for the Chinese Society, for which a
minimum of three collators were
requested. One lonely chap turned up and
no blame on him, but the rest of the
society owes me some w o r k (or money!).
If neither is forthcoming next week then
no ads of any kind will be included untill
their debt is repaid. Y o u have been
warned!
