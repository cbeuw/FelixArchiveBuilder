CARS
For Remembrance Service
From 7am Friday 9th to Sunday
evening, cars, bicycles and
motorcycles will be R E M O V E D by the
Police from A L L roads and public
areas around the Royal Albert Hall.
This includes Prince Consort Road and
parts of Exhibition Road and
Queensgate.
The U G M on November 8 will now be
held at the main Kensington site, at 1pm
in the Great Hall. The main item of
debate revolves around proposed changes
to the College day.
A W o r k i n g Party, on which 1 sit, has
been set up to make recommendations.
These will probably include one or more
of the following.
• Starting the day earlier
• Finishing the day late
• Lengthening the lunch hour
• Moving the lunch hour
• Holding an evening session
Some suggestions are more probable than
others—the most likely one is to extend
the day to finish at 6.30pm.
In order to report back to the W o r k i n g
Party in time for its next meeting on
November 9, I need feedback from
everyone at the U G M .
It is possible that these changes may be
implemented next term—it thus affects
everyone. Please turn up and voice your
opinion.
