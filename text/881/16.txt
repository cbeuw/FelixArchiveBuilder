LETTERS Scribblers' Corner
Spotty
Dear Sir,
First the reply, from Saleem Choudhery,
to m y previous letter. 1 indicated that the
Arab Nations were perhaps 400 hundred
years less mature culturally. It also
appears that they are less mentally
mature. In reply to the reply; what do
you think 'per capita' means? If you're
going to invade our allies, and study at
our Universities, perhaps y o u had better
learn our language.
But to this week's letter. What is the
RCS playing at? Last year three guys
stood for President, all three failed their
year. So this year to fill the vacated
space, they held some new elections! This
produced two candidates. O n e has lots of
experience, but is not yet registered, has
failed her year, and will be in the RSM
having dropped out of physics into
Material Science! T h e other guy is the
opposite; arrogant, no experience

Hacks
whatsoever, got 80% and is just doing it
for C V points! I'm not sure which one is
worse. N o w that the one i n the R S M has
got in, two out of three of the RCS exec
are in the RSM!! People in the RCS seem
to be either spotty idle failures or spotty
workaholics.
I only saw the maths voting station, but
it consisted of a black box, a hack, and a
chair. No one was encouraged to vote;
there was no sign, no 'hello have y o u
voted yet?' nothing. Would y o u go up to
a hack and ask him what he was doing?
I'm not sure I'd want to know. T h e RCS
complain of apathy amongst their
students, but what about the hacks
themselves? It's no wonder that none of
their elections are quorate; ie 300 people
(out of 1,500) have to vote for it to be
quorate so that it is a fair representation.
If it's not quorate it has to be ratified b y
a U G M (which are never quorate

themselves) which only the hacks attend,
so it's no wonder the hack w o n .
Amongst the RCS general population
the w o r d 'hack' is used as a n insult. It
donotes a bunch of self-perpetuating
degenerates. A n d it's hardly surprising
when the hacks count the vote. Before
you mention it M r Hack; who's to say
that members of staff aren't pro-hack? Is
it a n y wonder that they have this image
if the elections are not well publicised,
are subsequently not quorate, and then
ratified by an even smaller minority!!
Guilds is excellently run a n d very
popular. T h e President is top of her year,
the Vice-President is top 12. Perhaps this
is not a coincidence. Most people at
Imperial are here to get a degree (except
for, apparently, the RCS hacks), and so
long as they think that being an RCS
hack means being spotty and fucking up
your degree none of them will get
