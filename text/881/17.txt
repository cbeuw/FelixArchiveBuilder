involved. W h i c h means more hack
elections, and more apathy. Catch 22.
Come on RCS. Fuck the hacks. Everyone
at Imperial is intelligent but if you can
sort out your degree, y o u c a n be a good
President, as Miss McClay proves.
Perhaps in the next election in
February the union will publicise its o w n
elections, and encourage people to vote.
If the RCS students see that the elected
executive were voted in by, perhaps, half
the student body, they might have a little
more faith in their union.
If M r Briant had the experience then he
would, in m y irrelevent opinion, have
made an excellent figurehead, if only to
encourage others (perhaps less big
headed). I hope he sticks around till
February.
Yours, Athena.
PS. Maybe a nuke could 'miss' Iraq and
hit the RCSU?

W h e n I wrote the article concerning
Cecil Parkinson I took great care in being
as accurate as possible; especially as far
as quotes were concerned (now that
students are poorer than ever I cannot

Conservative Party). After m y article was
published in F E L I X (on October 19) I
spoke to many people (ranging from
Conservative to normal), a l l of w h o m said
that the article was fair a n d accurate. I
therefore take strong objection to being
called a liar b y M r McCarthy, w h o in a
subsequent letter to FELIX states that he
was not even present to hear M r
Parkinson speak. Either he is psychic or
Mr McCarthy was told by one of his
reliable and totally unbiased ConSoc
friends (he neglected to mention that he
is the treasurer of ConSoc) that 1
misquoted M r Parkinson.
If I did misquote, I d i d so completely
unintentionally. M r McCarthy may like to
know that in future FELIX will endeavour
(where possible) to keep tape recordings
in such situations to resolve any
subsequent differences of opinion
between concerned parties.
Lastly I would like to congratulate Mr
McCarthy in making fun of the complete
lack of security during M r Parkinson's
visit; he m a y have stumbled upon an anti-
terrorist policy that is much more
effective than the government's present
one; let's laugh at serious lapses in
security and maybe the IRA won't blow
us up. I think that M r McCarthy's attitude
in this matter shows a complete lack of
sensitivity towards families w h o have lost
relatives in terrorist activities. Just one
example is the comparatively recent
murder of Ian G o w M P . I'm sure that his
family would not find his letter all that
amusing.

LETTERS
Dear FELIX,
Murray's apologies accepted. But next
time someone in authority wants our
posters taken down ask us. 1 would much
rather take d o w n all icsf posters myself,
than have them ripped d o w n and binned.
W e then have to print more, wasting
time, money a n d paper (which we waste
to m u c h of already).
A n d as for the other times when the
walkways have been cleared for no
apparent reason, I consider them as acts
of vandalism. E v e n if the College cleaning
staff are responsible.
Alex McLintock.
