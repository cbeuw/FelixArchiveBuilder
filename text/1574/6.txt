Confessions of a GTA: Part 14
The GTA
Anonymous
Are GTAs working hard or hardly working?
In the early days of my GTAing I
thought it strange that all the other
GTAs became twitchy when there was
a quiet tutorial. I mean what is better
than getting paid a decent wage just
to stand there, literally sometimes for
hours. Some of the longer labs can be
up to three, not a bad little break from
banging your head against the wall of
“research”. I mean after a few years at
Imperial a bit of boredom is welcome.
But out of the corner of my eye
I could see them, the older PhDs.
Hovering around groups of students
that might be stuck (or in fact just
discussing who the power couple of
thedepartmentis).Ortheywouldpace
up and down, start sweet talking the
lecturer or start heckling the students
outright to make sure the students did
not even have an inkling of a question.
What was really noticeable was
these veterans never chatted. They
remained on point, prepared to leap
to the needs of any student and would
always be seen answering a question
when the lecturer walked back into
the room.
This hit me at the common
denominator: the lecturer. As a PhD
you have moved a few rungs down
on the apathy level. Not only will
lecturers now know your name,
they might also have met your like
boyfriend or something. (Even
sometimes they might know where
your parents live and yes, this has
disturbed my sleep). But with great
power… well a recognisable face …
comes great responsibility. I came to
realise when a lecturer asked me to
teach in a class, he/she (probably he)
would remember if the students asked
me things or avoided me at all costs,
which has happened.
The main reason for this is that the
lecturers pay for the pleasure of our
company out of their funds for a class.
If they employ too many GTAs they
will have over paid for something they
could get for less. The first symptom
of this is a quiet class. This is where
the veterans come in to their own.
They become indispensable as they
are the only ones working while all
these newbies are standing at the
front chatting. They also have known
the lecturer longer. They will be the
first for the call backs and the pay
check for next year.
Now in a quiet room of students
working beautifully quietly, I find
myself insanely pacing, drumming up
questions even the students did not
think they needed to ask and being
totally icy to my chatty colleagues.
So my confession is that you need to
give GTAs work to stop this obsessive
behaviour. Ask them that question
however stupid you think it is, they
will love you for it.
