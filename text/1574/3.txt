70m from South Kensington tube
L
ondon was plunged into
travel chaos again this
week: another tube strike
left commuters stranded
as parts of the city ground
to a standstill. For those of you who
somehow missed the first one, this
is the second strike instituted by
the Rail, Maritime and Transport
Union (RMT) as they protest the
planned closure of all of London
Underground’s ticket offices. This
latest 48-hour walkout comes after a
planned strike in March was halted by
the RMT at the eleventh hour – but
unfortunately for Londoners, no such
reprieve came this time around.
The dispute began several months
ago when TfL, chaired by the Mayor of
London Boris Johnson, announced its
modernisation program for the tube.
This plan envisaged increasing some
tube services to run 24 hours a day
over the coming years, and shutting
the ticket offices at stations (which are
allegedly a drain on resources that is
used on fewer than 3% of journeys).
Under this agreement, there would
have been no compulsory job losses
– but the RMT leadership refused
to accept this and balloted their
members on calling a strike. Despite
only around 30% of the RMT’s London
Underground Chapter members
voting in favour of industrial action,
strikes were announced by the former
leader of the RMT Bob Crow earlier
this year.
Following the successful mediation,
there was hope amongst Londoners
that they would be spared further
disruption, however the process
took an unexpected turn following
the shock death of Bob Crow from a
heart attack in March of this year. The
timeline of events has led to some
suggesting that this latest strike is a
manifestation of the RMT’s infighting,
as different hard-left members of the
union attempt to gain their members’
loyaltybeforetheupcomingleadership
election – though the front-runners in
the election unsurprisingly deny this.
In addition to the expected
opposition from Johnson who called
the strike ‘pointless’ and ‘farcical’,
both David Cameron and Ed Miliband
have stepped in, with the Labour
Party leader saying that it was ‘wrong
for the strike to go ahead whilst
negotiations were still taking place’.
London Underground’s Managing
Director Mike Brown offered the
chance for a review of the decisions
made so far, but insisted that the ticket
offices would remain closed. The RMT
dismissed the offer as meaningless.
The Tube chaos has seen the
city’s streets grind to a standstill.
TfL is running nearly 300 extra
buses including several heritage
routemasters, but even this couldn’t
alleviate the gridlock that faced many
commuters on their journeys today,
whilst in the west of the city the travel
chaos was heightened by a separate
strike on the Heathrow Express by
RMT workers. In addition to the 40
mediation meetings held to date,
more will no doubt happen over the
coming days.
Whether they will come to any
fruition with both sides refusing to
back down is another question, but we
can only hope…
Travel Chaos – Strikes Again!

NEWS FROM OVER EASTER
Scientists Discover
Dwarf Planet
Joe Letts Editor-In-Chief
The newly discovered dwarf
planet 2012 VP113 was discovered
by astronomers at the Carnegie
Institution of Science, Washington in
April.
With a diameter of 450km it is the
smallest celestial body to lay claim
to the title of the most distant planet
in the solar system, usurping dwarf
planet Sedna (2003). Precisely, while
Sedna is the body in the solar system
that travels furthest from the Sun,
with an orbit ranging from 76-937
AU, 2012 VP113's minimum distance
from the Sun is 80AU, and so qualifies
as the most distant solar system object
when ranked by minimum distance.
Nicknamed ‘VP’, the discovery of
the dwarf planet proves the existence
of the inner Oort cloud, a doughnut-
shaped region in the spherical outer
Oort cloud. The Oort cloud is a region
of icy bodies that exists far outside
Neptune’s orbit.
Looking at the elliptical orbits
of both 2012 VP113 and Sedna,
astronomers believe that there may
be a large undiscovered planet that
interferes with their orbits due to its
large gravitational pull. Nicknamed
“super-Earth”, it would in theory need
to have a mass 10x greater than Earth
and orbit the Sun at roughly 250 AU.
Evelyn Gardens Set
To Close in 2015
According to anonymous sources,
the entire network of halls in Evelyn
Gardens (providing accommodation
foratotalof613students),issettoclose
in 2015, with student accommodation
spaces being transferred to the
accommodation in Acton that is
under current development.
The fate of the accommodation in
South Kensington seems unclear,
with some of those involved believing
that the halls will be refurbished, and
opened again for use, while others
believe that due to the short number
of years left on the Evelyn Gardens
lease (less than 30 years), College will
deem the investment (rumored to be
between £10-60 million unviable and
will permanently relocate the hall
spaces to the halls in Acton.
A College Spokesperson provided
the following statement:
“Imperial commits to provide all first
year students with a place in a hall of
residence and aims to offer a broad
range of room types and rents. To do
so the College continually reviews its
accommodation portfolio to ensure it
meets current and future needs. The
College leases Evelyn Gardens. With
the lease set to expire in 34 years,
Imperial is currently exploring options
for the future of this accommodation.
From 2015 the hall will either be closed
for a period while refurbishment takes
place, or the property will be removed
from Imperial’s accommodation
portfolio.

Honors For Imperial Academics
Joe Letts
Editor-In-Chief
P
rofessor Erol Gelenbe
(Dennis Gabor Chair,
Dept. Electrical and
Electronic Engineering)
was recently awarded
the honour of Chevalier de la Legion
d’Honneur (Knight of the Legion of
Honour) by French President Francois
Hollande for 43 years of service in
Higher Education and Research.
Professor Gelenbe, who also holds
an Honorary Professorship at the
University René Descartes, invented
the Random Neural Network Model
and is highly respected in the field
of Computer System and Network
Performance Evaluation.
Meanwhile Regius Professor of
Engineering Chris Toumazou was
nominated by the European Patent
Office as a finalist in the ‘Reseach
Inventor Award 2014 earlier this week.
Professor Tomazou is known for
the development of a speedy DNA
test that is run by a microchip on
a USB stick. In just 20 minutes the
chip detects differences in DNA by
measuring hydrogen ions that are
released during the synthesis of DNA.
The professor is one of 15 finalists,
spread between the categories:
Industry, SMEs, Research, Non-
European countries, Lifetime
achievement.
Professor Mike Finnis was presented
the Humboldt Research Award by the
German “Alexander von Humbboldt
Foundation”. The award, which is
given in recognition of the entire
lifetime achievements of an academic,
is valued at 60,000 EUR and includes
a year long invitation to work with
german scientists on a long-term
research project.
Another academic, Professor Sir
Brian Hoskins, the first Director of
the Grantham Institute for Climate
Change will be presented the 2014
Buys Ballot Medal by the Royal
Academy of Arts and Sciences for his
work in Meteorology.
Finally, while not an academic,
the Rt. Hon The Baroness Eliza
Manningham-Buller, chair of the
College Court and Council was
recently appointed Lady Companion
of the Most Noble Order of the Garter
by the Queen.
