Everton vs. Man City (Saturday,
5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
After impressing for long spells, it
looks like the season will end in dis-
appointment for the Toffees, who
will surely have to settle for a Europa
League finish. But Roberto Martinez
can be proud of their maiden sea-
sons in the job. By contrast, Man-
chester City are still very much in
the title race, and with Sergio Ague-
ro and Yaya Toure both fit, they have
the incentive to end their poor run at
Goodison Park and take the initiative
again in the battle at the top. 0-2
Chelsea vs. Norwich (Sunday, 4pm,
Sky Sports 1)
Despite not picking up a single point
yet under Neil Adams, you have to
say he has done a remarkable job, as
based on the number of chances cre-
ated they should arguably have beaten
Fulham and picked up a point at least
against Liverpool. But turning chanc-
es into goals has been the Canaries’
problem all season long. Having gone
77 home games without defeat prior
to the Blues’ last tie at Stamford Bridge
against fellow strugglers Sunderland,
Jose Mourinho will not tolerate losing
2 on the bounce and I expect normal
service to be resumed at the Bridge
this weekend. 3-0
Crystal Palace vs. Liverpool (Mon-
day, 8pm, Sky Sports 1)
Tony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers both
deserve to win the Manager of the
Season award after masterminding
two very different success stories this
season. Palace, seemingly long gone
when Pulis joined in late November,
might have been made a challenge for
a Europa League spot if the season
went on another couple of months,
while to potentially rise from 7th to
1st place in one season for the Reds is
even more astonishing than Manches-
ter United falling from 1st to 7th.
Selhurst Park is now a mighty tough
place to visit, but Liverpool’s mentality
this season has been to outscore their
opponents, and with Palace short of
goalscorers, the Reds can win this. 1-2
Best of the rest (Saturday 3pm un-
less stated)
West Ham vs. Tottenham (BT Sport
1, Saturday 12:45pm): Big Sam will
always demand a performance from
the Hammers but even though he
won’t get the manager’s job full-time it
seems, Tim Sherwood’s Spurs are end-
ing the season on a high. 0-1
Aston Villa vs. Hull: Realistically,
both these sides are surely safe as it is
almost impossible for the teams below
them to make up enough points to
catch them. Hull have an FA Cup Fi-
nal to think about, Villa don’t do home
wins and a point apiece would settle
any lingering relegation nerves. 1-1
Man United vs. Sunderland: This is
a bad time for the Black Cats to travel
to Old Trafford, as United will put in a
shift for Ryan Giggs. But Gus Poyet’s
men always raise their game against
the big boys so this won’t be plain sail-
ing for the outgoing champions. 3-1
Newcastle vs. Cardiff: As has been
the case for several months now, the
Magpies are on their summer holidays
already. The Bluebirds have to win at
St James’ Park to stand any chance of
survival, and having already done so in
the FA Cup, I think they will. 1-2
Stoke vs. Fulham: The Potters were
my tip for relegation at the start
of the season but hats off to Mark
Hughes for overseeing their transi-
tion to a passing side. It has been a
nightmare season for the Cottagers
and they may be masters of the great
escape, but this is fortress Britannia.
2-1
Swansea vs. Southampton: The
Saints players will not want to risk
injuries with so many in contention
for the World Cup, while the Swans
are safe, so this looks to me like a
dead-rubber. 0-0
Arsenal vs. West Brom (Sunday
1:30pm): It remains to be seen
whether this will be Arsene Wenger’s
last home game in charge but either
way, he will want them to finish in
the top 4 as they always have under
his tenure. Aaron Ramsey can lead
the Gunners to victory. 3-1
Underwater Hockey comes
3rd at Nationals
I
mperial’s Underwater Hockey
team won their first ever medal
at the University Nationals
tournament on Saturday 8th
March in Plymouth, finishing
3rd out of 17 teams.
A team of 9 players went to
Plymouth Life Centre (the home of
Tom Daley) over the weekend as part
of the biggest students’ underwater
hockey tournament in the UK. We
were up against 17 teams, ranging
from Oxford and Plymouth to places
further afield such as Stirling and
Bangor. There were 3 Barbarian
alumni teams from Plymouth,
Portsmouth and Warwick, who were
ineligible to win the competition.
The Imperial team led by captain
Eric Leung & vice-captain, Rajeev
Dattani, were hoping for a top 5
finish. We had four young players who
had never played in a tournament
before (Nathan Patel, Yiyu Wang,
Arnab Debnath and Derek So). The
relatively inexperienced players are
backed up by more experienced Alex
Whittington, Dan Barker, David
Harris and Rajeev Dattani.
Imperial College fought hard but
did not have the best start losing to
Portsmouth A (1-2) and Plymouth
A (0-5), the eventual winner, in the
opening games. However, with every
player giving 110%, team Imperial
had solid performances in the later
games. After some tough games
with Warwick A (1-1), Plymouth
Barbarians (1-1), Liverpool (4-0) and
Oxford (3-1), team Imperial found
themselves finishing 5th in their
group. A win over Stirling (6-0) in the
play-off put Imperial in the quarter
final against Plymouth Barbarians. It
was a tense match, but the final score
was not in Imperial’s favour. The
score was at 1-1 and a minute left to
play. Imperial had captain, Eric Leung,
sent off and were down to 5 players.
Plymouth Barbarians scored with 10
seconds left on the clock. Losing the
game 2-1, the team were in the play
off for 5th/6th place against Oxford.
There were two Barbarian teams who
were ineligible to win a medal in the
semi-final. A win over Oxford (4-
0) gave Imperial a 5th place finish;
meaning Imperial came 3rd amongst
the student teams.
The team walked away with a medal
hung round their necks for the first
time. It was a fantastic experience for
young players in the team, and was
the last student nationals for some
experienced players (Dan Barker and
Rajeev Dattani). The team is looking
forward to getting more new players.
Anyone interested in trying out please
contact Eric Leung (swl12@ic.ac.uk).
Thanks to Sport Imperial for non-
BUCS funding as well as to Plymouth
University Octopush Club and the
British Octopush Association for
organising the tournament.
What is Underwater Hockey?
Underwater Hockey is a fast paced
sport, played by teams of six at the
bottom of a pool with four alternating
substitute players. The aim of the
game is score more than the other
team by moving a lead puck along the
bottom of the pool using a ‘pusher’.
Snorkels allow the players to keep
moving with the game while they take
a quick breath between long dives. A
team scores by working together to
push, flick and pass the puck down
the pitch and getting it into the
opponent’s goal. This is often achieved
best through skill rather than brute
strength- proven by the fact this is a
mixed sport at adult level.
Want to play?
We train every week at St.
Mary’s pool, Paddington, at 8pm
on Mondays. This new and rapidly
expanding club is always looking for
more members. If you want to play
email Eric Leung (swl12@ic.ac.uk)
