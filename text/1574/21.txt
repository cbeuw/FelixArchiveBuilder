Maciej Matuszewski presents an eclectic selection of five great
books to help you help you relax during the busy revision period
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
Douglas Adams
Douglas Adams’ famous humour
series has appeared in many formats
– a radio show, a TV series, a film.
The books, however, remain many
people’s favourite. The story follows
everyman Arthur Dent, who is
rescued from the demolition of
the planet Earth in order to build a
hyperspace bypass, by his best friend
Ford Prefect, who he discovers
is actually an alien from “a small
planet somewhere in the vicinity of
Betelgeuse.”
The books are all wonderfully
inventive in their absurdity. Adams
was a comic genius who managed
to create both a unique and
colourful universe as well as fun and
compelling characters. There are
laughs on every page and the series
is a quick and easy read but it is also
very well written and has a surprising
depth. A must read.

Space Captain Smith
Toby Frost
Toby Frost has often been referred
to as Douglas Adams’ spiritual
successor and his first novel,
following hapless Captain Isambard
Smith of the British Space Empire’s
Royal Space Navy, certainly doesn’t
disappoint.
The book is very accessible and
laugh out loud funny, with a lot of
broad humour and jokes on topics
such a traditional British stuffiness.
However, this is a particular treat for
long time fans of science fiction, with
countless references to, and homages
of, classics of the genre – from Blade
Runner to Starship Troopers.
The novel also manages to be an
engaging action story, of a type
rarely seen nowadays in SF fiction.
The plot is fast moving and exciting,
while never feeling superficial, and
the characters are well sketched and
likable.
Collected Stories
Evelyn Waugh
Early twentieth century writer Evelyn
Waugh is widely regarded as one of
the greatest masters of the English
language. Possessed of a keen insight
and sharp wit his work is always
both intellectually stimulating and a
pleasure to read.
This collection of short stories
spans Waugh’s entire career, covering
a number of different themes and
styles of writing. Enthusiasts and
scholars of Waugh will appreciate
this book as a chance to get a better
understanding of his development as
a writer. Many of the stories are also
linked to, and help provide one with
a deeper understanding of, some of
Waugh’s longer work.
The Collected Stories, however, are
also a brilliant introduction to the
writer for novices. Pick up the book
and dive into one of the stories –
you’re sure not to regret it.
The Third Bear
Jeff VanderMeer
Jeff VanderMeer is one of the leading
figures of the New Weird movement,
which aims to link fantastical and
supernatural fiction with high
literary quality. This short collection
is one of the best examples of this
new subgenre.
VanderMeer has an amazing
imagination, creating a wide range of
fantastical, unsettling and downright
bizzare settings and characters.
These work well together with
VanderMeer’s mastery of style, tone
and atmosphere to create powerful
and surreal fiction.
It is difficult to describe the
individual stories since they are
completely different from anything
else that I have ever read before,
and from each other. If you want to
experience something unique and
utterly original be sure to check this
out.
Candide
Voltaire
Though first published in over 250
years ago, in 1759, Voltaire’s great
satire of the classical philosophy of
Leibnizian optimism still retains its
relevance today.
The novel follows the eponymous
protagonist, who lives in luxury in
the castle of his uncle, the Baron
Thunder-ten-Tronckh. Instructed
and encouraged by his tutor Pangloss,
he firmly believes that the world he
is living in is “best of all possible
worlds”. However his idyllic life is
soon disrupted as he is thrown out by
his uncle and, as he begins to explore
the wider world, he begins to find it
more and more difficult to reconcile
his philosophy with the real world.
Voltaire’s legendary wit is on full
display in this work and one can
easily see why it has inspired so many
people. It’s a very short novel, but one
certainly worth looking up.
