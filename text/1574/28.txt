PISCES
This week you decide to utilse your
good-for-nothing indentical twin,
you know the one that studies ‘how
to implement successful pyramid
schemes’ at the Business School.
You decide to swap exams with
your twin and delight yourself with
ticking arbitrary answers during
their multiple choice exam. You fail
spectacularly, while they pass with
full marks. Life’s a bitch, isnt it?
This week you tank up on
Rouge Bul and stay up all
night before that exam you
forgot to study.
Guess what bozo, you re-
vised for the wrong one!
Cheer up, at least you’ve got
a fantastic grasp of soil me-
chanics. Also you fall asleep
in the exam. Bet you wish
you’d never heard of Break-
ing Bad...
You’re hot. No, don’t worry,
it’s not a compliment, mere-
ly a statement of fact. You
should probably leave the li-
brary before you faint of heat
exhaustion. With any luck
you’ll wake up after your ex-
ams are over and be forced
to take the year again.
Hopefully they’ll have air con-
ditioning by then if they took
notice of your christmas wish.
This week you rejoice! As a PhD
candidate you happily gave up
the stress of exams years ago
and are feeling much better for
it. Instead you delight yourself
by invigilating an exam.
Bored beyond belief you de-
cide to make things more diffi-
cult by closing your eyes. When
you wake up everyone has left.
They got 100%, you’re fired!
This week you’re more than a bird,
your’re more than a plane... you’re
a birdplane!
A part of you is a bird, the other
part of you is a plane, and this
fundamental lack of understand-
ing of flight mechanics is why you
just flunked that Aero module you
took just for larks. You wish that
you could cry, but your cockpit’s
a bit rusty. It’s not easy.
This week you’re the Presi-
dent of the Union. While not
as wild as the President of
Oxford Union (not that one),
you try to put an injunction on
Felix after it threatened to run
a story about the fact that you
“actually quite enjoy the oc-
casional can of Pepsi, thank
you very much!” Foiled!
This week you decide to take a
fresh approach to life, deciding
to talk to the people around you
rather than focussing on the
floor. The first person who you
talk to happens to be a police
officer who thinks you’ve es-
caped from the local asylum.
As he takes you back to ULU
you swear to never try to be
normal again!
This week the Union finally closes
the gift shop. One can only
dream. Still, you still have a few
more months to work in there until
you’re freed from your glass cage.
Somebody walks by and throws
you some breadcrumbs. You
scream in rage, jump through the
glass window and strangle them
to death. Free at last! Noooo,
handcuffs!
This week you turn 24. That
provides enough misery.
Seriously, why are you still
here? Don’t let them suck you
in with promises of fame and
fortune. Fly you fools! Claw
back what time you have left
in your life! Did you know that
you’ve spent as long a time at
Imperial as the time you have
left until you turn 30?
This week you end up at the
Union. As you wait for your friends
in the foyer, you look up at the
television screen and see a video
with the Summer Ball logo. Con-
vinced the Ball will have lots of
girls in bikinis and sandy beach-
es, you stump up the £35, only to
be mugged on the way home by
a tramp in a mankini. If you close
your eyes it’s almost the same...
This week you decide to go all
out for revision and conquer
a small part of the library and
claim as your kingdom. Af-
ter your first exam you return
to your “castle” to find that a
group of freshers are waiting to
ambush you. You die in a blaze
of glory, only wishing that you
had been given a chance to
find out your marks first.
This week you’re free! There are
no more lectures! As you take a
sip of coffee and dance in cele-
bration you decide to make your
next stop Eastside! Two pints
down you realise that you forgot
to attach a formula sheet to the
exam your students are taking
right now! Shit! You could run
back now, instead you have an-
other pint and fail them all later...

Don’t Worry,
Exams Aren’t All
That Important
They’ll Only Determine
Your Future Employment,
Lifestyle, Spouse And
Happiness
SIGN LEFT LOOKING
PRETTY IMPOTENT
Spring Now Season Of
Death For Londoners
W
ith many of you
facing tough
exams in the
coming weeks,
we at Hangman
felt it was only right to remind you
that they really don’t mean much
in the long run. Well, if you’re not
counting how they directly contribute
to your future employability which,
of course, determines how much
money you make and obviously that
impacts on your lifestyle. And, I guess,
when you think about it, your lifestyle
determines your odds of meeting a
life-partner. In turn, this will almost
certainly effect your overall happiness.
But other than that, they’re basically
not important at all.
Smog Now Unstoppable
S
pring, a season once
appreciated as one of
renewal and rebirth
is now exclusively
seen as one of death
and disease in London.
The season, which is traditionally
associated with the passing of
winter and an explosion of life,
has confirmed itself to be a
bringer of death in recent weeks.
A season which, in recent years,
attempted simply to mark itself as
one of rain and misery, has taken
it one step further this year by
systematically suffocating us all.
The smog, rising like some agent of
Hell, proceeded to make everyday
activities extremely unpleasant
and a harbinger of doom for those
with respiratory conditions [read:
the weak] or a passing need to
venture outside [read: everyone].
Whilst staying indoors can help,
sources confirm that nothing you
do can stop the smog indefinitely
and that the easiest way to deal with
the whole thing is to simply lie back
and await the slow asphyxiation.
One can only hope for accelerated
global warming so that, in the
future, the transition from bitterly
cold winter to scorchingly hot
summer will be mercifully short.
These people are clearly successful,
probably because they didn’t fuck up
their exams.
It’s rumoured the smog first began to
rise up from the Hell-like environs of
the City. Photo credit: Getty Images.
