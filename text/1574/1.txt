“Keep the
Cat Free”
T
he Chinese Students and
Scholars Association
(CSSA) has joined the
Christian Union in having a
major election dispute this
year after a number of its members
wrote a joint letter of complaint to
the Imperial College Union reporting
that ballot papers were destroyed and
that the current committee holds a
weighted vote allowing them to chose
the new committee. David Goldsmith,
Union President, has declared
the original election invalid citing
multiple violations of the Union’s Bye-
laws for Minor Elections.
The new election will take place
on May 2nd 17:00 in Meeting Room
3 and the Deputy President: Finance
and Services will be acting as the
Returning Officer.
The list of reasons why the election
needs to be re-run (as stated by the
Union President) are that:
a) Publicity and voting cards were
in Chinese
b) Individuals who were not full
members of the Club were allowed
to vote
c) The election was not run under
the Single Transferable Vote or
Alternative Vote (as appropriate)
d) Objections to the results were
ignored
A facebook event has been set up
by the user “Ordinary Person” called:
The Corrupted ICL Society Of CSSA
and how you can help which has a
partially redacted copy of the original
letter of complaint sent to the Union
and the subsequent responses from
the Union. In the event description
students are called on to join the
CSSA to “prevent the second ballot
from being controlled by the current
committee members and pave way
for a truly clean and fair election.”
Criticisms of the facebook event have
been raised based on its potentially
slanderous comments about a large
number of the members of the CSSA
and the fact that comments which
give opinions differing to the of the
creator having been deleted.
For many Clubs elections are low
key matters and often candidates run
without opposition (save re-open
nominations if clubs are following the
Union Bye-laws properly). However
they are an important part of a Club’s
governance and in ensuring that
members get their voices heard.
With the CSSA being the second
Club to have a major election
complaint this year, it raises questions
as the how well Club elections are
actually being run. It is widely known
that many clubs struggle to get
the attendance necessary for their
Annual General Meeting to be valid
- the Union rules say 50%+1 of the
Club’s membership must be present.
This year saw a number of Clubs
run their elections using the Union’s
voting website as part of the Big
Elections rather than at a Club
meeting so are we seeing the rise of
the new voting system for Clubs?
When asked whether the Union has
any plans to change the election
procedures, the Union President
replied:
“We constantly review the support
we give to all Club, Society and
Project processes and will consider
recent events in any future reviews.”

CSSA in hot water over problematic election practices – new election pending
T
he Government recently
announced changes to
the Disabled Students’
Allowance, expected to
take place in 2016-17.
The changes, which according to
Universities and Sciences Minister
David Willetts are set to modernise
the system, will see a reduction in
the amount of financial support the
government is set to provide students,
instead placing a larger proportion of
responsibility on their universities.
As part of the changes to the
system, Willetts proposed that the
government would only pay for
“higher specification” or “higher cost”
computers when needed by a student
“solely by virtue of their disability”,
ceasing support for students requiring
regular computers, as well as help
with warranty or insurance costs.
Additionally, while the government
will continue to support “the most
specialist Non-Medical Help”, they will
also encourage universities to change
the way their courses are structured
and delivered with the aim of reducing
the “need for support workers” while
encouraging “greater independence
and autonomy for their students”.
Willetts also announced that in
the future the government would no
longer support additional costs of
specialist accommodation, other than
in exceptional circumstances.
The cuts are expected to reduce the
quality of university education for
many students with disabilities due
to the reduced support, and is being
heavily opposed by the NUS.
