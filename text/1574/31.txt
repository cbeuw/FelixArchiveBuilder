Women’s Rugby Bring Back
the Silverware
I
n the final game of the season,
Imperial needed a win against
Kingston to successfully defend
their LUSL title. The weather
and train engineering works did
not seem to be in the team’s favour
but once on the pitch, little could
stop Imperial continuing to play some
magnificent rugby.
The game began with both sides
looking pretty even. They were well
matched in the forwards, with posses-
sion being kept by the attacking side
through good supporting play around
the breakdown. In a classic forward
play from the maul, Heather Grant
went over for a decisive try.
Eventually, Kingston got sloppy over
the ball and were penalised on mul-
tiple occasions for not rolling away
at the tackle. They didn’t learn from
the quick tap penalty which allowed
Imperial to gain forward momentum
more than once and score.
Kingston clawed one back using the
wind to kick into the distance and al-
lowing their pacey wingers capitalise
on the 50-50 balls. At half time, both
teams had scored but Imperial led by
three tries to two.
In the second half, Imperial put
pressure on Kingston’s clearance kick
which led to the most spectacular
individual try by Clara Gago on the
wing. She caught the ball just beside
the try line on the 22 m line and held
strong to break two tackles and score
right in the corner.
Changing tactics Imperial opted
to exploit their strong centre com-
bination and pass out quickly in the
backs. Inside centre Charlie Stephens
crashed through to score a hat trick
and was well supported by outside
centre and player of the match, Car-
olanne Vouriot.
Imperial could’ve extended their
lead if only they chose to pass out
more and exploit the overlap from the
wing. However, they kept moving for-
ward thanks to supporting runs from
forward of the match Kirsty Edward
who followed up every break.
However, Imperial’s performance
couldn’t be equalled with the final
score at 58-10. Congratulations to the
team to securing the LUSL champion-
ship again!
T
he Imperial Falcons
participated in the BSUK
Inter-university Baseball
Spring Cup over the
weekend of the 22nd and
23rd of March with a team composed
largely of newcomers and achieved
a respectable third place finish after
close losses to the top two teams.
The Falcons opened up their
campaign with a rousing 15-6
demolition of the UCL Capitals with
a strong pitching performance from
freshman pitcher Zack Wang. The
team also put up a good offensive
showing with 6 hits and 8 walks
drawn. The huge win put the Falcons
in first place overall going into the
second game against the Nottingham
Thieves who had earlier been routed
by the University of East Anglia Blue
Sox 17-7.
The second game got off to a good
start with the Falcons cycling through
the entire batting order for 4 runs off 2
walks and 4 hits from Matt, Stephane,
Ashley and Zack. One more run would
have scored but third batter Rhys was
tagged out at home in an attempt to
steal. The Thieves then put up a strong
batting performance and capitalized
on Falcon errors to score 3 runs and
get back in the game. The second
inning saw the Falcons extend the lead
by 1 run before closing out the inning
in style with ace pitcher Vincent Li
putting up a monster performance
with 2 strike outs to give the Falcons
their first 1-2-3 inning. The third
inning saw the Falcons pile on more
pressure with shortstop Ashley
leading off with a massive ground rule
double that was centimeters shy of a
homerun. Vincent and club president
Chris Carter then drove in 2 more runs
to give the Falcons a commanding 4
run lead. The Thieves responded well
however and answered with 3 runs of
their own to bring themselves back in
the game. The fourth inning proved
to be the most disastrous one yet for
the Falcons, as they failed to score
any runs and committed multiple
errors to allow the Thieves to score
5 runs and take the lead which they
did not relinquish for the rest of the
game. Despite a huge 2-run homer
from Zack in the top of the sixth, the
Falcons fell to a 10-15 defeat, putting
them in second place going into
the final round-robin game against
tournament favourites, the UEA Blue
Sox.
After a much needed rest, the
Falcons were back in action on
Sunday against the Blue Sox. The
Falcons exploded out of the gates
with a massive 8 run top of the first
to instantly take a commanding lead
against the Blue Sox. Ace Vincent then
held the Blue Sox offense to 3 runs
to give the Falcons a 5 run cushion.
However, the Blue Sox then stepped
up their game and showed their
credentials as tournament favourites
to score 19 runs while holding the
Falcons to none in subsequent innings.
A late pitching switch by the Blue Sox
allowed the Falcons to notch up some
more runs for a respectable 18-24
scoreline as the Falcons fell to third
place in the tournament standings.
Following a walkover over the UCL
Capitals in the third place play-off, the
Falcons emerged as overall third in the
Spring Cup. Despite the disappointing
showing, the Falcons showed their
strong potential with newcomers
Alex, Stefan, Rhys and Monal
putting up strong performances in
the field and on the plate. With the
strong improvements made despite a
limited training schedule, the Falcons
are confident of better results in
the coming year as the team looks
forward to the BSUK Inter-university
Softball tournament on Saturday
(29th March).
