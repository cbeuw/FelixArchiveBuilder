The cutest spring 2014 trends
Spring is here and the sun has come out, so its time to update
your wardrobe! These trends are sure to keep you cool in the sun

Jogger trousers
This loose style of trouser is perfect for spring -
not as heavy as jeans but still not as exposing as
as a pair of shorts. They’re ideal for the milder
weather, and not to mention, they’re super
comfortable!
Skater dresses
Skater dresses are the easiest dress style to pull off
in the warmer months. They’re loose and breezy
and flatter all body shapes thanks to their A line
skirt that skims over the hips and smooths out any
bumps. Dress up a simple style (like the one above)
with some bright accessories.
S
pring is slowly starting to set in
in London, and although we’re
not feeling the mini-skirt wearing
heat yet, these trends work for the
transiton stage between winter and
summer. On a cooler day, carry around a chunky
knit sweater to ward off the occasional chills of
the British spring time, and don’t forget to keep
a portabe umbrella with you in your hanbag,
because one things for sure in this city: There will
be spring showers!
Jogger trousers, Missguided
£14.69
Jersey skater dress, H
and m
£7.99
Sandals
This season, the metallic trend is big.
Sandals in gold or silver hues are great
for dressing up casual looks. If you’re
not big on shiny shoes, you can go
for basic black sandals with jewelled
details to dress up your outfit.

Tory Burch, £200.00
Crop tops
Crop tops are a cute and girly spring trend.
They’re showing up on the desinger runways and
all the high street fashion stores and you can find
them anywhere from H and M to Alexander Mc-
Queen. On a warm day, rock it with a cardigan,
and on a cooler day, you can still wear the trend
with a cropped sweater.

simple look. Go for a a colourful
one if you’re accesorising plain
black or white outfits.
