installation.
I freely admit to being a bit of a
Wordpress snob, it just seems so
commonplace. While I must concede
the fact that it is another extremely
powerful blogging system with a
friendly User Interface (UI), I think
it has become the MySpace of the
blogging world. There are so many
plugins that the Wordpress (WP)
platform has become a bit too cluttered.
On an average WP blog, a visitor can
be easily distracted by the page layout,
the interesting widgets on the sidebar
(including a count of the tens of people
who have recently visited from across
the world) and the ability to log in and/
or leave a comment.
Meanwhile I feel that Tumblr (or
Yahoo for the commercially conscious)
blogs are too sporadic in nature. They

If you choose to go ahead with
installing Ghost on a server, you should
follow the easy official instructions
available on the Ghost installation
page. The platform runs on the modern
Node.js web framework, so be ready to
install it.
Tip: Use the “nave” virtual
environment manager for nodejs in
order to keep your Node.js project
dependencies separate. I’m sure you
don’t want to break an older Node.
js app by upgrading your currently
installed version :)
After following the fairly simple
installation guidelines (make sure you
pay special attention to the version of
Node.js the project depends on - see
packages.json file), the new blog will
be available on port 2368 of your new
server (also don’t forget to change to
change the host to host: ‘0.0.0.0’ in
config.js otherwise you won’t be able
Google announced a few weeks ago
via a Google+ post that it has plans
to create its very own smartwatch.
No concrete details on the wearable
device are known as of yet, but
the sources across the netscape
indicate that it could build on already
established partnerships with HTC,
Asus, LG and others.
The foray of Google into the
wearable device industry raises the
interesting fact that despite the
assumption made by many that Apple
is the most innovative company in
the world, Google has in recent times
done much to earn that recognition,
and its announcement to create a
smartwatch is further evidence of this.
The company has skillfully built on
software engineering, its business’s
core competency, and has been able
to generate innovative outputs like
its driverless cars and the recently
released Google glass. These two
projects are a testament to its business
environment which harnesses the
creative talents of its workers, as
opposed to ideas coming from a
singular individual as was the case
with Apple, if this is fair to say.
Not all Google’s attempts at
innovationhavebeenasuccessthough,
in fact, these failings could easily be
slated as the company’s falling short
of developing a monopoly. A product
like Google+, its social networking
offering could arguably be classified
as an over-reach, just as its attempts
in buying Motorola to have a foothold
As soon as I had finished installing
Ghost on a cloud virtual server, my
good friend Luke G-B pointed out the
existence another awesome blogging/
CMS platform called WagtailCMS.
WagtailCMS is a Django-powered
Content Management System created
by Torchbox, a web design consultancy
based in Oxfordshire. The project
homepage also features a case study of
the platform in use by our neighbours
at the Royal College of Art (RCA).
The platform is completely Open
Source, with the source code available
on Github along with a demo website
and a handy tutorial by Serafeim
Papastefanos.
WagtailCMS requires a lot more
configuration and customisation
than Ghost in order to be useful. As
well needing to define page types
before being able to create an article,
the platform also comes without any
packaged style sheets, in fact you have
towritethetemplatesforeachpagetype
from scratch, which means that you can
create a fantastically complicated blog
with a lot of planning, but also have the
chance to customise the application to
your needs, once you understand how
to use the system.
While using the WagtailCMS
platform requires a large amount of
specialised technological expertise
(if you don’t even know what Django
is - apart form an awesome modern
python-based web framework),
with the right frame of mind, and an
experienced Web Designer you can
create works of art (have a look at the
RCA website).
Meanwhile, for those of you with a
bit of server-admin know how, or more
time than you know what to do with,
the Ghost platform is fairly easy to set
How to get into Ghostblogging!
Choosing a platform
Why Not Wordpress
or tumblr?
seem to be almost Twitter feeds made
permanent, a few fleeting thoughts and
a large pool of pictures poured into a
disjointed list of posts. I am aware that
David Karp, the 27 year old founder
of Tumblr wished to make a blogging
system with a difference, and he did
achieve his aim, however I believe that
it fails to meet the needs of the slightly
more serious or mature blogger.
The reason why I am such a fan of
Ghost (so far) is its simplicity, clean
design and Open Source nature. Any
soul with a $5/mo (USD) server, or a
kind friend (with a server) can easily
host their own personal Ghost blog on
a domain of their choice.
Alternatively, you can pay $5 a month
to have your blog hosted by Ghost
themselves, which roughly adds up to
£36 per year.
The cost is more than the cost of a
free WP blog, but this basic plan does
boast
“... premium email support, unlimited
features, unlimited users, unlimited
themes & apps, and support for custom
to view the blog from outside the host
server - which is only useful if you have
a VPN via the server and want to keep
your blog private).
Logging on to http://your-domain-
or-ip-address-here:2368/ghost brings
you straight to the login page of your
blog. This allows you to set up a user
and start blogging!
The blog posts are written in
markdown, which is a fairly simple text
markup (oh the irony) language (I’ve
just learned it) and the writing interface
is really easy on the eye and simple to
use. The blog comes with a standard
theme that can be easily customised or
replaced with a pre-built theme.
In order to get your blog ready for
the production environment, the Ghost
team suggest using the Nginx web
server solution, rather than running
the Node.js development web server. I
am still on the Node.js web server (the
application is running in a “screen”)
however, I have also used the apache
http_proxy module to route all requests
for port 80 to port 2368(it took 5
minutes and Google) which means that
my blog now serves as the homepage of
my domain.
Finally, as an extra step, if you’d like to
receive emails from the blog, (especially
if you’d like to be able to reset your
password one day), I’d also recommend
following the instructions to set up
an email address for the blog to send
notices from. Gmail is particularly well
supported, so the procedure should be
simple.
Tip: Remember to restart the web
server application after changing the
website’s configuration files on the
server in order for the new settings to
come into effect!
So, Congratulations! If you’ve
followed each step in the article (and
the linked instructions) you should now
have a fully functioning (and slightly
hipster) blog to amaze your friends, or
hide your deepest thoughts.
How to install Ghost
in the smartphone industry similarly
proved futile.
However, although it couldn’t
establish a foothold through the
conventional means of creating a
smartphone, its inception of the
android operating system which
is openly licensed to smartphone
makers has made it a major player
in the industry, as far as operating
system goes, with 76% market share.
This can be chalked up as an example
of innovative problem solving which
again marks Google out from the rest
of its competition.
Returning to the smartwatch,
Google aren’t the first to conceive
of the idea of making the wearable
device. Sony as a matter of fact are
prepping the release of their second
watch, while Samsung released its
own smartwatch, the Samsung Gear,
last year. As Ewan Spense of Forbes
argues, the smartwatch industry
is still “virgin territory”, despite
these entries, which leaves it open
to Google’s vision and let’s face it,
resources, to dominate the industry,
unless ofcourse, Apple has something
to say about it.
