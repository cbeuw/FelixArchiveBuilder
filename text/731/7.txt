Planning For Disaster
Incidents at nuclear power plants, like the one in 1979 at
Three Mile Island in the United States, are fortunately very
rare. However, it is important to consider the potential
consequences of such accidents and pre-plan emergency
procedures. Debbie Wilkes examines the research being
done at IC in this field and the safety measures being
taken at home and abroad.
T h i s assessment of
possible c o n s e q u e n c e s c a n
be extremely c o m p l e x , as it
has to take into a c c o u n t all
the factors of the release,
its dispersion into the
environment, a n d the
resultant contamination
and exposure of h u m a n
beings. Here at Imperial
C o l l e g e , in the M e c h a n i c a l
Engineering Department, a
g r o u p under D r H e l e n
A p s i m o n is looking at
numerical models for the
dispersion of pollutants in
the atmosphere; with the
aim of estimating risk on a
probabilistic basis a n d to
help in the planning of
e m e r g e n c y procedures.
P r e - p l a n n i n g of
e m e r g e n c y procedures is of
the utmost importance, as
in the event of an accident
at a nuclear power plant
rapid action might be
needed to protect people.
T h e form of any protective
measures w o u l d d e p e n d o n
many different factors
including local geography,
situation of population
density relative to the plant,
weather conditions a n d the
magnitude of the release.
In the early phases during
the release steps might be
taken to protect people
close to the plant from
contamination through
atmospheric exposure. For
any protective action to be
effective there w o u l d need
to be prior k n o w l e d g e of
w h i c h areas were most at
risk. O n c e an a t m o s p h e r i c
release had finished there
w o u l d then be the problem
of foodstuffs, especially
milk and crops, b e c o m i n g
contaminated with activity
deposited from the c l o u d .
At this stage it might be
necessary to protect people
at a greater distance from
the plant a n d the protective
measures might well
include destruction of any
milk p r o d u c e d in the area.
Finally there w o u l d be an
inquiry, w h i c h w o u l d
involve an in-depth analysis
of the c o n s e q u e n c e s over a
greater distance. If the
most effective e m e r g e n c y
p r o c e d u r e s are to be
p r o d u c e d then all of these
factors have to be taken
into account.
Dr A p s i m o n ' s work
originally began with a
research project b a c k e d by
the F r e n c h C o m m i s s i o n
Energie A t o m i q u e ( C E A ) .
T h e project was to estimate
the collective d o s e to the
w h o l e population that
w o u l d c o m e from the small
d o s e s (small c o m p a r e d to
the natural background)
that result from routine
operations. T h i s involved
looking at h o w radioactivity
might be d i s p e r s e d o n a
E u r o p e a n scale, a n d has
subsequently led to further
work in this area with the
E u r o p e a n C o m m i s s i o n . T h e
C o m m i s s i o n requires
countries planning to build
nuclear power stations to
report to the E E C o n the
potential transfrontier
c o n s e q u e n c e s of an
accident in o n e m e m b e r
state o n another m e m b e r
state. B y using c o m p u t e r
simulations of the
dispersion Dr A p s i m o n has
been able to obtain a m u c h
fuller picture of the
potential c o n s e q u e n c e s of
an incident.
W h e n looking at the
potential risk all the many
different environmental
dispersion pathways have
to be taken into account,
with the result that
assessments c a n be
extremely complex. For
instance, the characteristics
of the terrain around a
nuclear power plant may
greatly affect the
dispersion. Weather
conditions at the time of an
incident may also have an
impact, particularly rain, as
precipitation brings the
radioactivity d o w n to earth
s o contaminating the
surface and affecting the
safety measures needed. A
recent development at the
Meteorological Office means
that there is n o w better
information about the
distribution of rainfall in the
United K i n g d o m . U s i n g
radar s c a n n i n g they now
p r o d u c e a map, o n c e every
five minutes, s h o w i n g
w h e r e it is raining.
However, at present this
type of service is not
available for most other
E u r o p e a n countries. T h e
g r o u p have also been
c o n s i d e r i n g the effect of
living in cities. In particular
whether buildings provide
any shielding, and the ways
that radioactive material
may penetrate buildings.
D r A p s i m o n will shortly
be chairing an E E C group
w h i c h is being set u p to
review c o m p u t e r i s e d
assistance in accident
assessment. B y m a k i n g u s e

Valentine Verisimilitude
Yes, it's Valentine's day
again, folks, the day when
all your friends get more
cards than y o u , even
t h o u g h y o u posted o n e to
yourself on W e d n e s d a y ,
a n d deep in the heart of
Imperial C o l l e g e there is
excitement in the back row
of lecture five of the
A d v a n c e d C h a t t i n g - u p
T e c h n i q u e s course. O u r
heroes, Luke, Mike, Neil,
Oliver, and Pete, all
b u d d i n g IC B a c h e l o r s have
each received a Valentine
from one of the five
luscious beauties in the
front row; A n d r e a , Barbara,
Christine, Diane, a n d
Elizabeth. T h e y are trying
to guess w h i c h girl sent
w h i c h card.
L u k e r e c k o n s that A n d r e a
sent Neil's card. Neil,
meanwhile, is certain that
there is no way Luke's card
c o u l d have c o m e from
w e r e originally d e v e l o p e d
for use with radioactive
pollutants, but they are also
valuable for use with other j
pollutants a n d are currently
being used in G e r m a n y for
acid rain studies.
Dr. A p s i m o n is also a
motivating force behind the
E u r o p e a n A s s o c i a t i o n for
the S c i e n c e of Air Pollution
( E U R A S A P ) , of w h i c h s h e
is currently c h a i r m a n . T h e
association, w h i c h w a s o n l y
formed recently, aims to
provide a forum for
c o m m u n i c a t i o n and
coordination between
scientists, from Eastern as
well as Western E u r o p e ,
w o r k i n g in the field of air
pollution. S o far there has
been an e n c o u r a g i n g
response from scientists all
over E u r o p e , a n d
E U R A S A P has full
p r o g r a m m e of meetings
planned for 1986 b e g i n n i n g
in B u d a p e s t in A p r i l . T h e
international flavour of the
association is reflected in
the committee w h i c h has
m e m b e r s from P o l a n d ,
N o r w a y , the United
K i n g d o m , F r a n c e , H o l l a n d ,

C z e c h o s l o v a k i a . T h e
m e m b e r s are also drawn
from m a n y different
disciplines including
meteorologists, chemists
a n d biologists. But also
very important, the
association aims to i n c l u d e
the people implementing air
pollution air pollution
control measures, so also
has m e m b e r s from industry
a n d government bodies.
Last week's incident at the
Sellafield r e p r o c e s s i n g
plant is a reminder that
although accidents at
nuclear power plants are
rare, they do h a p p e n . In the
event of a more serious
accident measures to
protect people might need
to be taken with great
speed. T h i s c a n best be
achieved if well researched
pre-planned e m e r g e n c y
p r o c e d u r e s exist.
D i a n a or Eliazabeth. M i k e
thinks that Pete's card is
probably from Barbara, and
Pete s a y s that Mike's card
was definitely not from
Elizabeth.
N o n e of the cards was
actually sent from the girl
that c a n be d e d u c e d sent it
on the basis of these
statements. Not only that,
but every statement turned
out to be wrong.
O n e of the girls is Pete's
sister, and thus hasn't sent
him a valentine and,
k n o w i n g w h o she is w o u l d
enable y o u to give all the
details about w h o actually
sent Valentines to who.
S o who did s e n d a
Valentine to w h o , and w h o
is Pete's sister? A n s w e r s ,

I've had no solutions to
this, so I'll let it run for
another week with a few
clues—it really isn't that
hard. The easiest strategy
works as long as your
opponent doesn't put any
of his c o i n s along a certain
line. A more c o m p l e x
version of this s a m e
strategy relies on w h o puts
their c o i n right in the
centre of the table. T h e
strategy works for a
circular or rectangular
table, but not for a
triangular one. E n o u g h ?
