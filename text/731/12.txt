amusement in the IC camp.

The N/S IC pair reached
6NT when everybody else
was playing 4H. It was a
desperate try to reach the
King of Diamonds in a
dilemma. He led another
spade which gave the IC
pair an outright top.
And lo, it came to pass in
the days of Frank the
Usurper there arose a great
torment in the land. Runes
were cast and prophets
warned of omens
foretelling doom. A
leprechaun was seen
playing the bagpipes, whilst
two goblins were overheard
discussing the benefits of
aluminium replacement
window frames. And there
arose in the land a great
wringing of hands and
rubbing of genitals and
people cried 'Oh who will
lead us out of these dark
times?'
The task was undertaken
by one Bilbo Jefferson,
prince of the Halfcuts. The
Great Deeds of Bilbo,
Scourge of Middlesex, are
recorded in the book 'There
and Back Again (stopping
for a few bevvies on the
way.' This document
records Bilbo's clash with
the forces of darkness, his
struggles with ores,
dragons, trolls and housing
benefit officials. For at this
time a great darkness lay
over the land, and good
people walked in the
shadow of fear. In the
hours of darkness it is said
that innocent-looking
kitchen utensils performed
unspeakable acts with
consenting pieces of
' cutlery.
But Bilbo rode forth. Red
was his banner, black was
his steed and brown were
his trousers. With the help
of a few loyal Rotarians,
Bilbo overthrew the
Darkness and made the
land safe. Once more a
man could walk freely in
the open and purchase
Nescafe over the counter
without fear of
recrimination.

Hyde
Park
Relays
On Saturday 22nd February
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics Club
are holding the 38th Annual
Nike Imperial College Hyde
Park Relays.
The event is a road relay
of 6 laps for men and 4
(slightly shorter) legs for
women held over a course
of some 3 miles a lap in
Hyde Park.
The competition is held
mainly for students and,
probably boasts the largest
student participation in the
country for such an event.
Particuarly strong this year
amongst the students are
of course Loughborough
University who include
amongst their number
Chris McGeorge. Ikem Billy
and recently crowned
U A U / B U S F cross country
champion David Buzza.
Also look out for ex-IC
student Sam Carey—now
running for Sheffield (2nd
in UAU/BUSF). A certain
Tyneside guest team is
causing considerable
interest this year and will
prove a stern test for the
students teams. It includes
Geoff Turnbull, 1984
London Marathon winner
Charlie Spedding and
possibly a Mr S Cram
(World one mile no 1, world
2000m no 1, world no 2 and
first man below 3.30min at
1500m etc etc— I think you
know the guy!!)
On the home front, the
London University front
man is Mark Scrutton of St
Thomas's who was 5th in ^
the World Student Games
in 1985 at 10000m: Imperial
College have a strong
presence in the London
University side with 3 of the
six man team.
Imperial College entrants
We will enter as many
Imperial College teams as
possible—people (men and
women) wishing to take
part should contact IC
Cross-Country Captain,
Jon Lea, Chem Eng IV
immediately—teas and T-
shirts for participants.
Since the authorities will
not allow us to mark the
course we need people to
prepare refreshments and
to help marshal the
course—volunteers should
turn up at 9.30am on the
morning of the event and
ask for either Bryan
Gamblin, marshal officer,
or Mike Jones, Hyde Park
Relays Organiser: If you
are interested, it would be
helpful if you could contact
Bryan Gamblin Mech Eng 2
before hand.
