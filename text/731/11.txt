Baha'i
The third world war has
already begun. Its victims
are the populace of the
starving third world,
murdered by us because
we choose to spend our
mis-gotten money not on
them but on SDI and
Trident. And no doubt,
when we have finished with
them, like mad dogs we will
turn on ourselves, finally
smithereening spaceship
earth as completely as the
unfortunate 'Challenger'.
Present technology and
present attitudes do not
allow any softer option.
I would not paint such a
gloomy picture if I thought
there was any way out.
It would be customary for
a person of any religious
persuasion such as myself
to see as a solution to the
world's problems the need
to unite in a common cause
('after all, we're all Gods
children aren't we? So let's
forget our differences and
Opsoc
Opsoc's thirtieth Annual
production in College will
be 'Princess Ida' by WS
Gilbert and AS Sullivan.
Imperial College Operatic
Society , to give it its more
formal name was formed in
1956 to 'produce light
opera in the South
Kensington Community'.
Ever since the first show
('Victorian Melodrama'), we
have presented an
extravaganza, usually by
G&S, each February,
although in the past we
have performed works by
Offenbach, Mozart and
Bizet. The society
completed the fourteen
G&S Opera canon last year
with the 'Grand Duke'.
The society maintains a
high standard by the
involvement of Music
students, as well as
consistently having a high
quality orchestra made up
of old members, music
students and IC students.
Each year we put on a tour
to Budleigh Salterton, and
last year, our 18th visit, we
were given a civic reception
in the town. This summer,
we are to tour with 'The
Mikado', and if you are
interested in being in the
show, please contact any
member at 'Ida' after the
show.
Princess Who?
'Princess Ida' was written
around the same time as
lolanthe' at the height of
G&S's success, and despite
the illness of its composer
live in peace...'). But while I
believe that to be true in a
way, at the present time it
is not a particularly
illuminating or useful
observation for there are
genuine ideological
differences fragmenting
society. Communist and
Capitalist, Christian and
Muslim, Conservative and
Labour, 'and everybody
hates the Jews' (Tom
Lehrer). 'Forgetting our
differences' means, for
many people, forgetting the
faith for which they stand.
But history is full of tales of
people dying for their
beliefs, and there is no
particular reason to believe
that the trend will not
continue, especially since it
is at times of crisis that we
are called upon to be more
principled, not less.
So I suggest that we do
not waste effort by
pleading with people to
forget their ideological
differences. Rather, we
should suggest to them
that they postpone the
conflict, and meanwhile get
at the time it contains some
of the best music
throughout. It differs from
the rest in that it has three
acts as oposed to the
normal two, and the libretto
is written in blank verse;
the actual libretto being a
reworking of an earlier
Gilbert play. The show was
a satire of Women's
lib.being written as such
establishments as Girton
College were being built,
continuing Gilbert's use of
controversial subjects.
Sounds boring—what's it
about?
Fortunately the plot is not
as complex as you might
remember last years 'Grand
Duke'...It is set in the days
when knights were bold.
Well it's like this, there
were two kings, one of
whom's daughter was
betrothed to the other's
son. In the meantime,
however, the Princess had
gone away and started a
'Woman's University' to
which, not surprisingly, men
were not permitted. The
Prince and a couple of his
friends decide to dress as
women to try to capture the
love of the Princess.
Needless to say they get
found out and his father
turns up and a good old
fight takes place. Of
course, a lot manages to go
on as well, but then you'll
just have to come to see
that—it's worth coming to, I
can assure you!
Who's doing what?
The show is conducted by
Dick Stockton, who was in
the Society for many years,
and has now returned to
wave his arms. Meanwhile,
along with the business of
keeping ourselves alive -
'ourselves' including, of
course, the people in the
third world, or what is left
of them. All this is, indeed,
in the long-term interest of
the continuance of the
ideological debate, since
this would otherwise be
impossible if we were all
dead.
In practical terms this
means making a mental
note to prove the
ideological point some time
in the future, and for the
present, to heal the
wounds. How nice it would
be to hear conciliatory
language between religions
and political parties. How
nice it would be to see the
back of 'Rambo' and 'Rocky
4'.
It's just like in a marriage
(I speak from experience).
One has to be mature and
rise above the level of
petty, unending bickering,
by making a mental note to
resolve the point of
principle at a less highly
charged moment, and in
William White, who played
Grand Duke Rudolph last
year is Directing. Please
come along if you can, it's
not as boring as you may
think....
Where can I get tickets?
Tickets are available from
the Haldane Library, level
2, Sherfield at lunchtimes,
Opsoc members and the
door (whilst stocks last).
See you there.

make up.
Bahais believe that while
the 'Most Great Peace'
(Which I interpret as being
the time of the solution of
ideological problems) is
still a long, long way off,
nevertheless the 'Lesser
Peace' of political trust and
tolerance is imminent,
because mankind has now
reached the stage of
maturity. I do hope that we
Bahais are right, because
otherwise, quite honestly,
it's curtains.

Many people in this
country have never read
one of the four gospels in
the Bible since they were
children. Many people have
never decided who Jesus
was. He definitely existed
historically, many other
sources apart from the
Bible testify to this.
Who was he? A brilliant
teacher, orator, moralist-
yes but he claimed to be
more than that.
Who was he? God.
Anyone who claims to be
God today would normally
find himself in a lunatic
asylum pretty quick. Jesus
could hardly be described
as mad. Was he a
deliberate trickster or an
evil man? It doesn't fit with
the facts. The way he lived
and other people's
testimony about his life
don't leave us this option.
Jesus said 'If you have
seen me, you have seen the
father' (JOHN 14) Why not
read John's Gospel, look
for yourself, find but what
Jesus actually claimed and
decide for yourself. Who
was He? What did He
come to do? Come and
find out.
