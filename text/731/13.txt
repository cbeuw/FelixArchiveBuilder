IC*s w i n n i n g league run

walkover) in a rather
scrappy affair at
Harlington. H a v i n g b e e n
beaten twice by N e w
C o l l e g e already this seasx
it w a s imperative that IC
beat this particular jinx side
to maintain their c h a l l e n g e
for the Premier Division
title.
In a g a m e in w h i c h
neither side m a n a g e d to

A l m o s t immediately. N e w

10 minutes from time, Alex

10 yards out.
Despite a few m o r e late

W h e n the legendary team
set of for N o r w i c h o n
Saturday morning, even
s o m e of its o w n m e m b e r s
couldn't bei.eve that they

the rather unsuitable
weather a n a the
d i s c o n c e r t i n g c o m m e n t s of
boring reasonabia p a s s e r s
by, the hard c o r e of the
team set cff in high spirits
to fight its way t h r o u g h
blizzards and arrive at the
frozen broads of Norfolk.
The first fight to b e w o n
was c o n v i n c i n g the
o p p o s i t i o n ( U E A ) that w e
w e r e seriously c o n s i d e r i n g
to break the thin layer of
ice and race against t h e m
For s o m e mysterious
reason they were m o r e
keen to g o to the pub a n d
challenge our drinking. A
short talk a n d a p r o m i s e
from our team that w e w e r e
willing to have a drinks
race afterwards c o n v i n c e d
them there was no place
for w i m p s in our team
(even if our C o m m o d o r e
still insists on using a lilo
to sleep on) a n d that we
were determined to g o out
there a n d race.
T h e start of the first race,
with the IC boats in first
and s e c o n d position and
the opposition trailing
behind s h o w e d that we
really meant what we said.
The rest of the races
proved to be as easy, so by
the end of the day we
c o u l d boast that we had
w o n al! the races in the
match, an achievement that
shouldn't b e
underestimated.
T h i s w a s d o n e without
the help of A p e , w h o
viewing the weather a n d
the lack of his dry-suit
d e c i d e d that being team
photographer wasn't a bad
idea after all. This proved
rather useful when R o b s o n ,
after winning the last race
d e c i d e d that he didn't need
to hold on the tiller
a n y m o r e . L o w e , w h o was
unfortunate e n o u g h to be
c r e w i n g for him at the time,
was not delighted when he
s a w the boat capsize. After
this demonstration of skill
by our team m e m b e r s , U E A
admitted defeat a n d
everyone was pleased to g o
back into the c l u b h o u s e
