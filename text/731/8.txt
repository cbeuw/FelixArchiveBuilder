Pantomime...
•Jim Clayden's top movies.
•Sunny Bains sniffs flowers.
•Jane Speigel gets on the hot line.
Movie, movie
...and a waste of time.
Everyone loves a list. And we at FELIX are definitely no exception. So,
to mark the British Film Industry's worst year for Oscar nominations to
date, (not a sausage), FELIX Film Editor, Jim Clayden, has come up
with 30 of the best films in and around London. Everything from love
heartfelt, (Letter To Brezhnev), to below the belt, (Rocky IV); from
crooning women, (Sweet Dreams) to dirty linen, (My Beautiful
Laundrette). Needless to say its only our opinion, and who are we to
talk? So, if you think you can do better, and we're sure you can, send
us a list of your favourite Oscar nominations, using any categories you
can think of. We'll publish the best of the bunch next week.
