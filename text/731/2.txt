""Bar
Certain FELIXs this week
have vouchers entitling
'them to a free half pint in
the Union Bar. This is a
genuine offer and not a
practical joke by U C L . Go
to the Union Bar tonight.
The promotion tonight
looks set to be a massive
success.
Survey
Remember to get your
Union survey forms in by
21st February if you want
to win a prize.
FELIX
This week I had planned a
twenty page special
Valentine's issue. It would
have contained a guide to
.Dateline agencys, a
pro'blem page, etc.
Everything had to be cut
because of technical
problems. This week I've
worked bloody hard to get
a basic FELIX out. All I get
in return is letters of
complaint. Dave Pearce has ,
complained that the news
stories about R S M U are
one-sided. This is because
we tried repeatedly to
contact Dave on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday
and could not find him. I've
also had numerous letters
complaining about our
story on the Bishop of
Durham. Like any
newspaper, we have limited
space for news. This means
that you have to select the
points that will be of
greatest interest to the
greatest number of readers.
FELIX is not some
Christian newsletter that
can ramble on at length
about the details of Dr
Jenkins speech. Over the
last few weeks we have had
several L O N G Christian
articles. The Christian
societies have had more
than their fair coverage.
FELIX can not cover every
news story as the people
concerned would wish, 'f
anyone else comes and
complains about the
Bishop of Durham article I
will be extremely rude. You
have been
warned Incidently if
anyone is still interested in
my job after this moan,
please come and see me in
confidence as soon as
possible.
Southside
I spent half an hour on
Wednesday with Pat, the
Southside Messenger. He is
worked of his feet because
he is having to answer so
many enquiries for mail.
College must do something
about this. Pat is being
overworked. In the
meantime may I suggest
that all Southside residents
only check their post every
other day or check it in the
afternoon to ease Pat's
load.
Sabbatical Elections
Unfortunately I can not
give you any details about
how to go about producing
publicity for the sabbatical
elections because of
icvt i s . . . 1IWH j j j * M**<T
ca.6
production problems.
Would anyone likely to
want to use the Print Unit
for publicity, come and see
me in confidence on
Tuesday so that I can
discuss arrangements.

Spencer:
Proposterous
Twit
Dear FELIX,
I see that preposterous twit
Tony Spencer is back at his
ranting. Whilst I won't
comment about the bulk of
his egotistical rambling in
last week's letters page, I
must object to the partisan
rubbish in his last few
sentences. For a start the
Below the Belt column in
FELIX has been running for
years longer than the trivial
and cliquey Vicious
Rumours page in
Boredsheet (only accurate
material in the title?).
Further seeing as I myself
wrote the Below the Belt
column last term, it owes
as much to my good friend
Hissing Sid (and Frank
Rowsell for those who
remember him) as to
anyone else.
I don't want to sound
pompous with all this but I
would just like to say that I
know people who will go to
great lengths to avoid Mr
Spencer ranting at them for
hours. Why someone of the
advanced years and hair of
Mr Spencer (I myself have
spent years trying to look
that aged) should waste his
time promoting all that is
worst in C C U rivalry I don't
know. How such a mind
bendingly boring person as
Tony can slag FELIX when
his idea of literature is this
year's Rag Mag is beyond
my puny brain. Personally I
find mountain cycling in
Albania far more appealing
than listening to Spencer's
drivel.
Yours wondering why ICU
spent £.1500 on Spencer's
Rag Mag
Mark Cottle
Hallworth Get
Your Act
Together
Dear Sir
Whilst finding Peter
Haljworth's letter in
January 21 FELIX very
informative, there are some
points that I would like to
query. Firstly, misuse of
property and equipment by
residents is cited as a,
presumably substantial,
loss of funds and I would
like him to specify what
actual type of damage was
done.
It was mentioned that on
site communication,
coordination and
supervisory qualities were
'severly affected' due to the
absence of the
Housekeeper, through
illness. If this was such an
important problem why was
there no temporary
replacement found for the
Housekeeper, or
appropriate transfer of
duties to someone in
authority?
I concede that Mr
Haliworth's argument that
painting the outside of the
Houses was to prevent
further crumbling of the
fabric may be valid but I
should mention that the
railings of the Houses were
painted also, which is
surely one of the most
cosmetic repairs to Evelyn
Gardens possible, whilst
inside, window locks and
pigeon-hole locks—surely a
priority in view of the
appalling state of security,
remained unrepaired or
absent.
Finally I find Mr
Hallworth's comments that
'there is little point in
increasing College security
when we are surrounded by
so many self-appointed
Clerks of Works' needlessly
destructive and implicitive
that his organisation and
deputation of responsibility
leaves much to be desired.
Surely Mr Hallworth should
be getting his act together?

Chemistry
Cash
Wasted
Sir
I write to draw your
reader s attention to the
new garage being erected
at the rear of Chemistry 1.
Unbelievably, this structure
is destined to house some
of the vehicles of Professor
Hartley and his wife, who
live in the penthouse on
top of Biochemistry.
With College spending
much time moaning about
lack of finance I am
astonished that a four
figure sum of money can
be found to provide a
garage to house cars which
aren't even used for
College business. T o make
matters worse, several
parking spaces have been
lost—parking spaces used
by people who are on
College business.
As they are local
residents, one wonders why
they can't get a street
space from the council, and
leave the car park for those
who drive into College
each day.
Yours etc
Nick Davies
