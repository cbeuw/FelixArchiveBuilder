E p o s e s a r e r e d . . .
Valentines day is upon us
o n c e again and little hearts
are fluttering all over
college. N o doubt s o m e of
y o u have sent little
messages of endearment to
your loved ones through the
Valentines c o l u m n , but if
y o u really want to win over
your sweetheart, what better
way than with flowers.
S i n c e C h r i s t m a s I have
visited twenty florists all
over L o n d o n , all of w h i c h
had been r e c o m m e n d e d to
me through various s o u r c e s
Out of these, / w o u l d only
be prepared to r e c o m m e n d
ten, and of these only three
are really suitable for a
Valentine posy from a
student (some were far too
expensive). Felton's and
Pulbrook and Gould, as y o u
will notice, are nice and
close: whereas The
Flowersmith is in the centre
of town - please don't let
this put y o u off, it's well
worth the trip.

Felton's is, in my estimation
at least, the best place for
fresh cut flowers in L o n d o n .
Its prices are very
reasonable and its flowers
are of very high quality.
Felton's actually g o e s to the
trouble of cutting their
flowers with a knife rather
than a s c i s s o r s b e c a u s e
they feel that this prolongs
the life of the bloom by not
closing up the stem. Their
service is very g o o d , their
delivery charges within
L o n d o n are a m o n g the
lowest I've c o m e across
(about Â£4 max), and they
have the added attraction of
a tempting display of
delicious (but fairly
expensive) h a n d m a d e
chocolates. T h e y accept all
four major credit cards and
are founder m e m b e r s of
Interflora.
Pulbrook and G o u l d

O p e n : 9-5.30, M o n - F r i .
A n old family firm, P u l b r o o k
and G o u l d specializes in
flowers and foliage from the
British countryside. A little
bit more expensive than
Felton's, (as y o u c o u l d
probably guess from the
address) this s h o p certainly
has more s n o b appeal. Sells
lovely roses in varying
shades of red, pink and
cream, any of w h i c h w o u i d
melt the heart of even the
most icy individuals.
A c c e p t s all four major credit
cards a n d is a member of
Interflora.

If y o u want something
unusual, alternative, or
avant-garde, then this s h o p
is a must. Exotic varieties of
fresh and dried flowers
(from the beautiful to the
grotesque) will be arranged
for y o u for exactly the effect
you want. A l l of the work
d o n e is very up-to-date,
stylish, and g o o d value for
money. A s well as having all
sorts of o b s c u r e but
g o r g e o u s flowers they d o
o r c h i d s in a glass... one of
the few places in L o n d o n
w h i c h does. Excellent
service, reasonable delivery
prices within L o n d o n . T a k e s
Diners C l u b , A c c e s s and

I h o p e y o u enjoy the
flowers... and the effect they
have!

Two minutes with Roger
could do wonders for your
love life.
N o , not a quotation from
2nd Lt. Preece's Presidential
C a m p a i g n but a bold
heading from the back page
of this week's Time Out
magazine.
R o g e r is R o g e r Elliot, his
telephone n u m b e r is 0070-
00777 and he offers a
telephone H o r o s c o p e
service with a
romantic/sexual twist. With
her heart in her mouth,
F E L I X deb Jane Speigel
tapped the keypad and
listened to the dulcet tones
of C u p i d Elliot over the
wires. T h i s is what he said:
Aquarius
Pisces
Scorpio
;ancer
You may have
difficulties
transferring
your
affections
from one lover
to another.
Be prepared
for a suprise:
heart-melt and
trembling
knees.
Something
good will
happen today.
Today is the
day for being
warm and
open-hearted.
Expect to be
manipulated
by your sweet-
het, but the
opportunity for
revenge will
arise.
Aries
Leo
Sagittarius
Capricorn
Today will be
busy and you
may be late for
a r o m a n t i c
date - so use
the telephone.
If y o u a r e
g o i n g to a
party today,
you may exp-
ect a flirty
atmosphere.
Get very near
to the person
you love today.
Even if you're
not f e e l i n g
sexy, at least
you'll be close.
Don't let any-
thing get in the
way of plans
you have made
with your part-
ner.
Virgo
Taurus
Gemini
Libra
If you have a
problem wjth
love then now
is the time to
talk it over with
a friend.
Lunchtime is
the time for
f l i r t i n g , but
don't act sexily
at dinner.
Today is the
day that you
will get into a
pickle with two
loved ones.
You will find it
easy to shine
both at work
and play.
FELIX Friday 14 February 9
