"In the future everyone will look like a baked bean can for 15 minutes..."
Andy Warthog
Some caustic wit pointed out to me
that today is Valentines Day and it
would be a good idea to include
some appropriate ideas in this
column. So having read Time Out's
little piece on their own lonely
hearts column I thought something
like, 'Scruffy mature journalist
seeks kindred wally for mutual
cynicism, boredom and tedious
conversations about Roy Harper
gigs' might fit the bill. Looking at
the sort of witicisms which actually
make it into print I feel a bit
humbled though. In addition I am
not really seeking to meet London's
Gay population on an intimate
basis, which would cut out a large
proportion of the small ad reading
population. But it must be said that
commercialisation does seem to
have crept into the way people meet
each other to a tremendous degree.
I'm sure there's very little you can't
get delivered to the loved one of
your dreams by an out of work
actor. Maybe this is one of life's
necessary evils in a place like
London, where social life is so
often interpreted as 'strutting your
funky whatsit' in a darkened room
where the music is so loud that, the
person you thought was a liberal
minded student into outdoor
pursuits is actually a married young
conservative into collecting
Victorian bondage gear! Personally
I think it cheapens the whole affair
if you pay (ironic, huh!) some
Albanian mountain cyclist to mutter
pre-composed words of endearment
and thrust a box of 'Black Tray' at
the target of your affection. Mind
you if it's all for Rag that's another
matter. And hey! — why are we
only allowed to be romantic one
day a year?

AVhen I took over this page
someone said something about ideas
for things to do in our glorious
capital. But once in a while there's
nothing wrong with taking liberties
— so this week's suggestion is
"clear off". 'Very droll' I hear you
say, but I'm desperate. Even the
less astute of you might have
noticed that BR has slashed fares
for Railcard holders for February
to one-quarter of the normal cost.
This means the reduction on some
journeys can almost pay for the
card — spend money, save pounds
(er?). Last weekend I went to
Bristol to see a gentleman called
Roy Harper. This will make anyone
who knows me cringe at the
thought of another plug for some
ageing ex-hippy (but he really is
dynamite live, makes Billy Bragg
look like Noddy goes to social
commentary land). The point is that
most people can probably think of
someone or somewhere they'd like
to visit and now is a smart time to
go and (in the words of the
immortal Pink Fairies) DO IT.
Well so much for pointing out
the obvious (as an old colleague on
the Tirane Times once said to me
while relating the story of how he
had pointed out to the great Eugene
Zhog, the 1962 Albanian cycling
champion, that it would be
impossible to leap to freedom in the
west, on his pushbike from the top
of Mount Hoxha — the old fool
was blown out of the air by half a
dozen machine guns before he
plunged into the Strait of Otranto
— but they never did find the
h,ody!). More depressing
disappearances this week include
Spitting Image and half a pint of
milk out of my fridge. I must admit
that the former is more distressing
but the replacement Hot Metal,
about the sordid newspaper
business, has got some good
reviews. Right now a bit of
sordidness would go down just great
around here to liven things up.
Speaking of things sordid I
always wondered what people who
play Dungeons and Dragons really
got upto. But I have been informed
by our local afficionados that there
is more to role-playing games than
sitting round a table saying things
like "I've just zapped your dragon
with a Magic Missile". The general
impression seems to be that D&D
is a reasonable but rather limited
Give your heart away this Valentines Day
game, and cheap once you've spent
thefirst£100 on books and starter
packs! The local loonies seem to
prefer Runequest (edition 2) —
mysterious by name, and a mystery
to me. It's wrong to be too cynical
about this as some of the games
shops around London are well
worth a browse (Ifindthat
browsing shops is often the
cheapest and most engrossing
pastime in London). THE shop for
people with strong fantasy urges is
Forbidden Planet in Denmark
Street, but the place itself, although
it has a wide range of SF books
etc, has been described as a 'hole in
the wall in Tin-Pan Alley'. Near to
Hamlet Gardens is Games
Workshop which is full of posters
giving a vast number of events and
seems to be very helpful. Games
People Play up in Notting Hill is, I
have been told, good for
independent models (ie other than
the usual Citadel crud). And two
more mainstream shops worth a
look at least are the Virgin Games
Centre and Hamleys. Personally I
can usually spend hours in Hamleys
regressing to childhood.
On tofilmsand my favourite
venue, The Scala, has some good
bills this month. On Saturday the
15th there is an all-nighter
featuring Dune, 200 Motels (Frank
Zappa), The Wall, Barbarella and
Up In Smoke. Then on Thursday
20th there is Dr Strangelove and
Apocalypse Now (two of the best
films on the madness of war ever
made) as a double bill. Saturday
22nd sees anoth" all-nighter with
Nightmare On Elm Street, Blood
Simple, Videodrome, Company Of
Wolves and The Evil Dead (yes the
one you're not supposed to be able
to get on video). Andfinallyon
Friday the 28th there is The
Terminator and a film called Death
Line. The latter is about a group of
survivors from an 1892 rail tunnel
disaster preying on commuters on
the underground, it's got to be
gross!
All night bills at the Scala are
£3.70 and start at about 11:30pm.
Normal bills are £2.70 (or £1.70 on
prduction of a student card during
the afternoon). There is also a 50p
initial membership. I can't claim
that the Scala is the most luxurious
cinema in London but it has a
certain character and the food stall
is a lot better than the tacky,
indigestible, overpriced, rubbish
found in most west end flicks.

So to the end of another week's
rambling and pretending to be a
pretentious listings mag. I would .
like to dedicate this week's column
to all those people who have made
mountain cycling in Albania what it
is today. Its not always fun being a
critic, in the words of Eric of
Aramathea the sports correspondent
of the Galilee Observer 'crucifixion
is murder on the hands....'
