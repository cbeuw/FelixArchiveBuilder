Dear H u g h ,
What a miserable a n d
misleading little article
F E L I X carried o n the
B i s h o p of Durham's visit
last week It c o n v e y e d
nothing of the infectious
enthusiasm with w h i c h the
B i s h o p spoke, n o r the
delight with w h i c h he w a s
received by his large
audience. Here w a s a m a n
alive with the faith,
knowledge a n d experience
of G o d , doing his uttermost
to bring together his faith
and the realities w e live
with without fudging or
d o d g i n g the issues.
W h e n he w a s a s k e d the
inevitable questions I heard
him say that the
resurrection w a s s o m e t h i n g
objective G o d did to
c h a n g e the disciples' belief
that J e s u s w a s dead into
the conviction that he w a s
alive a n d active in their
lives. A s for the virgin birth
he 'wouldn't put it past G o d
to do it that way, especially
if G o d w a s acting as she.'
but he h a d to note there
were other virgin birth
stories about g o d s a n d
heroes current at the time.
It would be refreshing if
F E L I X reporters wrote with
a fraction of the B i s h o p ' s
liveliness, wit a n d integrity.
It w o u l d d o your credibility
s o m e g o o d too.

Dear S i r ,
F E L I X recently carried a
story ' M o o n i e Blues' (31st
Jan.) containing several
untruths w h i c h I w o u l d like
to correct.
1) C A R P a n d the Unification
C h u r c h
C A R P is a movement for
people seeking high moral
and spiritual standards.
M e m b e r s h i p is not
restricted to m e m b e r s of
the Unification c h u r c h ,
although w e are proud to
have R e v e r e n d M o o n as
our founder.
2) T h e M y t h of
B r a i n w a s h i n g
T h e charge that M o o n i e s
practice brainwashing
techniques has been fully
discredited by recent
sociological a n d
p s y c h o l o g i c a l studies.
Prominent a m o n g these is
the ' T h e M a k i n g of the
M o o n i e ' (Basil B l a c k w e l l ,
£12) by Dr. Eileen Barker of
L S E . S i n c e the publication
of this a n d other studies,
the allegation of
brainwashing has been
discontinued.
3) C A R P 'offers students a
release from the drudgery
of work'
Students seeking a
release from work, o r an
easier path, will not find
what they are l o o k i n g for in
C A R P . C A R P expects its
m e m b e r s to excel in
a c a d e m i c studies. W e want
to demonstrate h o w to live
for the benefit of others
and for the sake of G o d
and mankind. T h i s is not
easy, but it is truly
worthwhile for those w h o
can rise to the challenge.
4) ' P e o p l e w h o join...are
separated from their
families (and) their
belongings'
Dr. Barker's study also
exposes this allegation as
untrue. T h e great majority
of members are in regular
and open contact with their
parents. T h e r e is n o
evidence of a n y o n e being
deprived of a n y
possessions u p o n joining
the Unification C h u r c h or
C A R P . S o m e like to m a k e
contributions, but these are
neither solicited n o r
required.
5) 'People w h o join...suffer
p s y c h o l o g i c a l d a m a g e '
T h i s is n o n s e n s e . In ten
years of m e m b e r s h i p , I
have never met a n y o n e
w h o has suffered
' p s y c h o l o g i c a l d a m a g e ' a s
a result of contact with u s !
T h i s is a media invention
n o w totally rejected by
serious scholars a n d
observers.
T h e R e v e r e n d M o o n is
also d e s c r i b e d in the article
as 'a c o n m a n ' . N o t h i n g
c o u l d be further from the
truth. In recent years,
leading figures from all
walks of life have c o m e to
know a n d respect the
Reverend M o o n for the
great work he is d o i n g -
scientists (including N o b e l
Laureates), professors,
politicians, ministers a n d
other religious
leaders...even journalists. In
reality, the R e v e r e n d M o o n
has always been ready to
invest not only m o n e y , but
also his blood, sweat a n d
tears for many projects;
often these are not even
associated with the
Unification movement.
R e c o g n i t i o n of this work is
also reflected in recent
m e d i a coverage. T h e trend
n o w a d a y s is neutral, often
supportive. T h e F E L I X
article is anachronistic in
its simple, inaccurate a n d
prejudiced response.
In c o n c l u s i o n , I urge all
IC students to find out for
themselves about the
challenging work of C A R P
and the Reverend M o o n , b y
contacting us at the
address given.
Yours sincerely,
Mike Balcomb
