Pinko Pete
Writes
Dear Hugh,
I've said this before at the
time of the Socialist
Society picket of Keith
Joseph, but in answer to
John Martin's letter (FELIX
728) I must repeat that the
defence of our education
and welfare isn't a left-wing
cause. No student, be
she/he Left, Right or
Centre, should be so stupid
as willingly to consign
him/herself to the poverty
which Sir Keith has
planned for us. Neither
should we stand by and
allow the destruction of the
education system on which
our younger sisters and
brothers will depend.
That our Union should
produce the impressive
turnout it did for Gren
Manuel's leaflet protest
shows, I believe, that most
IC students feel the same
way. Dave Kingston, hardly
a Left-wing activist,
attended the protest, as did
J Martin Taylor.
Finally, in the light of the
decision by K Q C students
in their recent referendum
to affiliate to the National
Union of Students (FELIX
729) , and that by U C L at
their U G M not to
disaffiliate, may I
congratulate those students
on their sound judgement,
and express the hope that
Imperial won't be too long
in following their example.
Faced as we are with
threats to our education
and to our standards of
living while at College, the
importance of national
representation for all
students, and of co-
ordinated response to the
threats has never been
greater.
Yours,
Pete Hobbis.
RSMU Defended
Dear Hugh,
I'd just like to comment on
two of your articles:
(1) Every Wednesday is an
RSM barnight.
(2) I gather the RSM Rugby
Club's 'disgusting
behaviour' consisted of
standing on a table singing
'We're going up sunshine
mountain'-a totally
innocuous song.
(3) The RSMU budget was
a statement of expenditure,
not the final claim to ICU,
which has to have income
deducted from it. Even so it
has risen, but this is due to
a rise in interest in RSMU
and the new clubs being
founded within it.
But did FELIX ever try to
ask our side? No! Yet again
one sided rumour is
printed, and the resultant
image not cared about. I
personally am beginning to
get pissed off with this anti-
RSMU stance. I Hope next
year's Editor will try and
ask the other side before
printing inflammatory
rumours.
/ remain yours, etc

Sexist SF Soc
Dear Hugh,
I wish to moan bitterly
about the grossly sexist
attitude displayed by Dave
Clements (I believe), SF
Soc Chairman (on
permanent loan from South
Bermondsey Sewage
Reprocessing Unit) ie
'...when men were men and
women did what they were
told' in last week's advert
(hardly a feature) for
'Picyornose 4'. It is bad
enough having to endure
the Cosmic Ferret's
abysmally pretentious
stories which weekly
masquerade as articles, let
alone being subjected to
his doctrinally unsound
attitudes. I suggest that
Temporary Women's
Officer Christine Taig
should ritually disembowel
him in Beit Quad next
Wednesday lunchtime. It
should do wonders for her
presidential election
campaign...
Yours non sexistly

MSc Arseholes
Sir,
When U G freshers come to
IC they tend to fit in pretty
quickly. Some are a
pain—maybe they've had a
year in industry, or come
from public school, and
think they know how things
ought to be—but it's their
first experience of college,
so they moderate their
views. PhD freshers are fine
too—either working quietly,
or being of such hyper
intelligence that they fit
into the 'IC Attitude' easily.
Most MSc's are great
guys/women too—but
some are real arseholes.
They come from some
crappy provincial little
university where they were
top dogs, and bring their
crappy provincial little
attitudes to Imperial.
There is a case in point
who attends the MSc/3rd
Year Al lectures in
Computing. What a wally!
He banters the lecturer with
pointless quips, interrupts
with irrelevant quips and
then loudly admonishes
any other student
murmuring in the
background. Yet he seems
to have no comprehension
of how incredibly irritating
he is to everyone else.
I am not criticising his
ridiculous dress or the way
he wrinkles his nose, like a
Pekinese on heat—each to
his own. What I object to is
his attitude to lectures. At
IC we listen reasonably
quietly and attentively.
Questions are used to
make ideas more
comprehensible. They
should not be used to
score points to enhance a
student's personal
standing. It is a pain in the
butt that one student can
so completely waste eighty
people's time for no better
reason than to try to make
himself look good.
Yours faithfully,
3rd Year Computing
Undergraduate

Thanks
Dear All,
May I, on behalf of Pete
and myself, say a big thank
you to everybody,
especially Tom, for the
support which the guests at
the R C S Annual Dinner
gave us on the
announcement of our
engagement. We expected
everybody to fall about
laughing but they were
great and it was just about
the best evening of our
lives so far. Cheers!
Pete and Callie
It's
