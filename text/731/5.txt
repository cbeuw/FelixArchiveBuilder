Judith H a c k n e y is to be the
Editor of the 1936 U n i o n
H a n d b o o k . Ms H a c k n e y
was elected by paper ballot
at "
1 uesday's IC U G M .
Sarah Kirk was the only
other candidate for the
post. P r o p o s i n g M s
Hackney, Alan R o s e said
that he believed that her
work on IC Radio. S T O I C
a n d FELIX, along with her
two years as a first year
student at C o l l e g e , would
bo invaluable qualities for
the job. Ms Kirk, the F E L I X
Reviews Editor, w a s
p r o p o s e d by last year's
H a n d b o o k Editor, Nigel
A t k i n s o n .
A m o n g the other issues
debated at the U G M was a
motion instructing the
U n i o n to c a m p a i g n for
flexible licensing hours in
English, and Welsh pubs.
Despite s o m e c o n c e r n that
this would contribute to the
Union's 'boozy image', the
motion was carried. T h e
last motion to be dealt with
p r o p o s e d that the U L U
policy of having 16 female
sessions at their Health
C o m p l e x , c o m p a r e d with
only 12 male sessions,
amounted to sexism. T h e
motion was attacked by
External Affairs Officer
Grenville Manuel and D P
Dave Kingston, w h o
reported that there is a far
greater d e m a n d for female-
only sessions, and the
motion was defeated by a
clear majority.
O n e further motion was
on the agenda, p r o p o s i n g
that U n i o n publications
s h o u l d refuse
advertisements from
B a r c l a y s Bank, and that the
U n i o n should discourage
students from banking with
Barclays. However, the
q u o r u m was successfully
challenged by A n d y Juscott
of D O C 3 w h o believed that
the poor attendance w o u l d
not provide a representative
vote. T h e meeting was then
brought to a close.

E s t i m a t e s R e v i s e d
T h e Royal S c h o o l of M i n e s
U n i o n have r e d u c e d their
estimate for next year from
£17 000 to £14 000. T h e
Estimate of R C S U and
C & C U are £11 000 and
£14 000 respectively.
I C U Deputy President
Dave Kingston has
suggested that these
estimates may be a c c e p t e d ,
with perhaps only a few
additional cuts. This w o u l d
mean that R S M U would be
allocated more money than
R C S U , w h i c h has more
than twice as many
students.
Mr K i n g s t o n justifies this
state of affairs by
explaining that R S M U
members tend to be more
active in their union than
their counterparts in G u i l d s
and R C S , thus meriting the
extra expenditure. He also
c o m m e n t e d that his
attitude towards such
matters was not swayed by
the n u m b e r of students
w h o would beneifit from
the money, but the
intensity of the activity
involved, and the
dedication and c o m m i t m e n t
of the people involved.
U n i o n F i n a n c e
C o m m i t t e e was due to
meet yesterday lunchtime.
O w i n g to printing
problems, F E L I X is unable
to report on the meeting in
this issue.
B a r S u c c e s s
T h e U n i o n Bar is more
popular now than it was
last year, I C U Deputy
President Dave K i n g s t o n
told F E L I X this week.
Mr Kingston believes this
is partly the result of the
positive U n i o n a p p r o a c h to
rowdiness. H e cited the
signs that have been
posted in the Bar
requesting people not to
stand on the tables as an
example of the way the
U n i o n was responding to
disturbances.
T h e Bar, has in Mr
Kingston's view, c h a n g e d
from being a 'hacks' bar to
one of a students' bar in
w h i c h students can feel
w e l c o m e , not intimidated.
T h e promotion of guest
ales a n d the presence of
B o d d i n g t o n s Ale has
attracted many students.
M r K i n g s t o n a d d e d that he
h o p e d that students w o u l d
be attracted to the U n i o n
B a r o n Friday night for a
pre-revelry b o o z e - u p as
many drinks are being
offered at 50p/pint.
F r o m Friday night
B u d w e i s e r will be on sale
instead of C a r l s b e r g
b e c a u s e of complaints
about the quality of
Carlsberg.
New Garage

Biochemistry is to have his

Department, after being
delayed for a few weeks
o w i n g to bad weather.
Professor Hartley lives in a
penthouse flat in the
Biochemistry building. J a c k
Parry of the Estates section
is handling the building
work, but it is unclear as to
w h o is providing the funds.
C o l l e g e Secretary J o h n
Smith said on T h u r s d a y
that Prof Hartley's garage
would replace one
d e m o l i s h e d when

important facility for Prof
Hartley b e c a u s e he has a
disabled daughter.
