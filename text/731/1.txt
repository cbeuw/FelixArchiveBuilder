Nightline Crisis
College Win Case
The future of West London
Nightline may be in doubt
unless other London Colleges
are prepared to provide a larger
proportion of the funds. College
Secretary John Smith has
indicated that IC will not be
able to maintain the current
level of financial support for
Nightline in 1986-87.
West L o n d o n Nightline is an
information and c o u n s e l l i n g
service run for and by students
in L o n d o n , and is based in
Princes G a r d e n s , S o u t h
K e n s i n g t o n .
Last year the total cost of
Nightline was £10,769. T h i s
figure i n c l u d e d the rent for flat
w h i c h Nightline o c c u p i e s ,
£3000, a n d the director's salary
of £4,469 as well as a telephone
bill of £1,352. Of this £1,835 w a s
provided by participating
students unions, including I C U .
In 1984-85 Imperial C o l l e g e
provided the a c c o m m o d a t i o n ,
and paid the phone bill and a
substantial fraction (40%) of the
director's salary.
I C U Welfare Officer Peter
Wilson has sent a circular to all
L o n d o n University student
u n i o n s and student newspapers,
highlighting the threat p o s e d to
Nightline. Mr W i l s o n e x p l a i n e d
that Imperial C o l l e g e will be
prepared to continue f u n d i n g
a c c o m m o d a t i o n a n d
administration costs, but that
other c o l l e g e s must m a k e a
substantially larger contribution
if Nightline is to survive. H e
called u p o n all student unions
to let their college
adminstration k n o w of the
difficulties. In particular he asks
that all college secretaries be
made aware of the p r o b l e m s
before the meeting of the
Secretaries of S c h o o l s
(Univeristy of L o n d o n ) on r
Febraury 28. A proposal will be
put forward at the meeting,
s u g g e s t i n g that Nightline-
s h o u l d b e c o m e a University
service, a n d the cost spread
thinly over a large n u m b e r of
colleges.
F E L I X s p o k e to C o l l e g e
Secretary J o h n Smith about the
Nightline issue yesterday
m o r n i n g . M r S m i t h pointed out
that other colleges are planning
to withdraw m o n e y from
Nightline, and he was not
enthusiastic about IC having to
support the service. H e was
u n h a p p y about the present cost
of £4 per call to Nightline.
West L o n d o n Nightline took
over 2,600 calls in 1984-85, on
average 12 per night during
term-time. Of hese around 25%
w e r e of 'counselling' type,
rather than straightforward
requests for information.

Imperial College has been
awarded High Court damages
of around £850,000 against the
firm of architects who built the
Electrical Engineering building.
The ruling against Norman &
Daburn, announced on
Wednesday, brings to an end
legal action which first began
more than eight years ago.
In 1977 it was discovered that
the ceramic tiles used to face
the Electrical Engineering
building, built between 1962
and 1963, were breaking away
and so c a u s i n g a serious safety
hazard. Work to replace the tiles
was finally b e g u n over two
years a g o in 1983, after C o l l e g e
s e c u r e d a loan for the repairs
from the U G C . W h e n the work
was c o m p l e t e d , and the full cost
