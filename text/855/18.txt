Is there anything you can do?
T
h
e motion T
h
e reason:
Voluntary Membership
ICU should not affiliate to the NUS until it
becomes a democratic organisation that is
accountable to it's members.
What is a Majority ?
Present ICU bylaws require a simple
majoirity of those who vote to affiliate to
the NUS. We want to change this to a two
thirds majority.
In it's present form the NUS does not allow
voluntary membership,is largely
undemocratic and holds views that many
of its members find abhorrent but which
they are powerless to change.
Every college in the NUS requires a two
thirds majority to disaffiliate. In fairness we
believe a two thirds majority should be
required to affiliate.
Polling Day
We wish to set the polling date to be in the
last week of the Spring Term.
The motion above requires a bylaw change
and the earliest this can be done is 16th
March.
Vote for independence at the U G M o n January 25th, Union
Dining Hall, Union Building at 6pm.
