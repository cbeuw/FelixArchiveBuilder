Q ew of those who apply become Schlumberger
engineers. After all we need our graduates for real
jobs. No ticking off stock in warehouses or vetting
petty cash vouchers, nor banks of automatons working
on "defence contracts".
THE ENGINEERS
They will be this year's best engineers, looking for a
career with their sleeves rolled up and their wits about
them. They must be physically fit and technically
excellent, as, working in all climates and at all hours,
they are responsible for measuring the characteristics
of an oil reservoir by lowering sensitive instruments
into newly drilled wellbores.
THE JOB
Then they interpret the data gained and make a
quantitative and qualitative scientific assessment of the
potential of the well and advise their clients. As well as
running the job for clients, Schlumberger engineers are
responsible for maintenance and calibration of their
equipment; and when the job is done they follow up
with the client and write the invoice.
In return, Schlumberger offer those who are good enough,
a career training and company background which will
gain them worldwide respect in the oil industry.
THE CAREER
We will stand by you, promoting you on merit. We won't
fail you on examinations designed to restrict the numbers
in a profession, nor will you have to wait for people to
retire before you can exploit your potential to the full.
In Schlumberger everybody starts as a field engineer and
engineers are on our board and at the heads of our
companies.
If you could be one of the few, working anywhere in the
world the company sends you, responsible for your crew,
your equipment and yourself, obtaining data on which
multimillion dollar decisions are made, in sweltering heat
or North Sea gales - contact your university careers
