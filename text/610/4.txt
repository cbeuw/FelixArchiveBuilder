M a r c o L e d w o l d considers
himself such an expert on the
Constitution so as to declare
(in true d e m o c r a t i c spirit)
U G M votes null and void,
h a v i n g a c t e d u n c o n s t i t u -
tionally himself in the same
week. But no, he's throwing
the book at us, demonstrating
w h a t a parasitic body the
U n i o n Officers have become.
It is obvious to anyone
present at the meeting that
the issue at hand was the l a d
that S t e p h e n G o u l d e r was
short of the quota required for
his election. Clearly, since the
antipathy towards Stephen
Goulder is so big that the
student body chose to dismiss
the whole procedure, rather
than ratify his election, he
ought to resign himself and
stand for re-election. If he
chooses to abide by the wishes
of I C students, then I'm sure
next time he will not be short
of a quota.
I do sincerely hope that a
re-election will take place and
that someone brings up a
motion lor a constitutional
change that calls for a man-
d a t o r y r e - e l e c t i o n i f no
c a n d i d a t e reaches q u o t a .
Anything else is a mockery of
democratic practice. A n d I
also hope that someone puts a
censure motion on the table in
the next U G M . M a r c o ought
to be reminded who the real
boss is in the Union.

Dear Mark
I hope you will allow me
t h e s p a c e to pass a few-
comments on M r N . Willson"
S o a p b o x " T h e A r t s a n d
Sciences a n d Technology""
a n d his review of v o l u n u
t h r e e of G e o r g e O r w e l l ' s
Collected Essays in last week's
F E L I X .
That M r Willson knows
little about what he loosely,
terms the arts is quite appa-
rent from both pieces. In his
O r w e l l review he suggests
that " F r o m the point of view
of getting recognition from
the l i t e r a r y establishment,
being boring is probably an
advantage for a writer" and
cites authors such as Dickens,
Kafka and Solzhenitsyn as
evidence for his contention.
Leaving aside M r Willson's
allusion to the literary esta-
blishment, since he does not
specify what he means by this,
anylwdy who can find Sol-
zhenitsyn's Russian writings
boring (and rememlx-r they
were written at great personal
risk to himself) is lacking in
literary appreciation.
Turning now to his Soap-
box article. His first claim
that polytechnics were Ibund-
ed as not to have too much
science a n d technology in
universities is quite simply
w r o n g . T h e p o i n t of the
polytechnics was (whether it
is now, is open lor discussion)
to provide vocational educa-
t i o n . T h a t is to e d u c a t e
people specifically for the
careers they would pursue in
later file. Thus not only does
technology figure prominently
in the polytechnics, but also
such vocational subjects as
languages, law, architecture,
social sciences, etc. N o w the
object of a university is to be
strictly non-vocational in that
it provides an education by
which individuals may attain
the widest possible career
choice. In other words univer-
sity e d u c a t i o n is there to
educate the mind. N o w this is
the theory ol" tertiary educa-
tion in this country and in
order to understand why the
system is as it is, it is necessary
to appreciate what it was
designed to achieve. Thus the
d i s c i p l i n a r y d i s t i n c t i o n s
which M r Willson draws are
simply not valid. I would very
much like him to name a
university i n this c o u n t r y
which does not have a science
faculty. Whereas there is at
least one university (Brunei)
w h i c h does not h a v e a n y
students m a j o r i n g i n arts
subjects.
I shall ignore w i t h due
contempt M r Willson's re-
marks on the amount of work
t h a t a r t s s t u d e n t s d o i n
c o m p a r i s o n w i t h s c i e n c e
students (i.e. very little in his
opinion) and pass on to what I
t h i n k is the most serious
aspect of M r Willson's article.
This is that he himself makes
a crucial distinction between
science a n d the a r t s . H e
assumes that arts an- more
"pleasant" (his word) than
science. That is in some way
he is accepting the idea of the
intellectual superiority of the
artist over the scientist. This is
nonsense. He assumes that
serious artists concentrate on
b r o a d issues such as the
"significance of the Russian
revolution" while the scien-
tists have to concentrate on
the minutiae of the "thermo-
stat". This is again nonsense
as M r Willson would realise if
he took the trouble to discover
what he is t a l k i n g about.
M o s t artists are also con-
cerned with the minutiae of
their subject such as the role
of the railways during the
Russian revolution in Central
A s i a . O n the o t h e r h a n d
scientists deal w i t h broad
issues such as the origin of the
universe. The point is that the
sort of generalisations that M r
Willson made are not only
wrong they are also dangerous.
They perpetuate the myths
that each discipline has of the
o t h e r so that d e s t r u c t i v e
people like M r Willson can
endeavour to cast a slur on
those people who are more
interest in other things than
they are in science or techno-
logy.
One reason why M r Willson
has a low opinion of the arts
compared to the sciences is
that he thinks that the latter
are " u s e f u l ' ' a n d have a
"utilitarian" value, both of
w h i c h q u a l i t i e s he t h i n k s
artists despise. I quote "Artists
can only preserve their work
because (his emphasis) someone
else is l e a r n i n g about soil
mechanics". What does M r
W i l l s o n m e a n by this? In
what logical sense is the word
because used? I would suspect
t h a t M r W i l l s o n m e a n s ,
although it is not at all clear,
that scientists and engineers
and soil mechanicians, help
p r o v i d e the w e a l t h of the
country which he thinks goes
to support artists. litis is a
simplistic argument since it
ignores the fact that artists
first of all produce things—
books, paintings, etc.—and
secondly they help consume
the products of the economy;
consumers are as important to
the economy as producers, a
l a d which M r VVillson appears
not to have grasped. So where
are we left with the word
useful. It is simply a word
which M r Willson defines in
such a way as to justify his
bigotted attitudes. In other
words he is a t t e m p t i n g to
deny the freedom of the
individual to study what they
wish to study; Orwell rules!
M r Willson also has a very
p e c u l i a r a t t i t u d e t o w a r d s
science in that he thinks that
the content of science is fixed
in a way that art is not. He is
tight in the latter, but wrong
in the f o r m e r . H e s h o u l d
know, but appears not to
know, that the content of
science changes and that this
is the purpose of research.
Even where the content of
science is acknowledged it
may be subject to different
interpretations. For example
in the recent discussion of
Darwinian natural selection
which was conducted in these
pages I argued for a strictly
materialistic interpretation of
the nature of life while others,
in my opinion mistakingly,
argued lor a diestic inter-
pretation.
In c o n c l u s i o n I w o u l d
suggest that M r Willson does
not know what he is talking
about a n d s h o u l d follow
Wittenstein'sdictum "whereof
one cannot speak, thereof one
should remain silent".

Dear Mark
In last week's Soapbox, N .
W i l l s o n i n f o r m s us t h a t
"....most people interested in
the arts are pratts; they're
usually pretentious, arrogant
and self-important."
N o w , passionately inter-
ested artist though he obvi-
ously is, he has totally failed
to make use of the basis of
arts, i.e. communication of
ideas; his otherwise excellent
a r t i c l e * does not t e l l us
a n y t h i n g we d i d n ' t k n o w
already. However, if he would
let me know what he is trying
to say, I (as a pretentious but
literate scientist) would be
delighted to put his thoughts
in to an article for inclusion in
next week's Small Ads column.
