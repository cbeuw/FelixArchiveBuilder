Pilot Plant
Takes Off
Decision Today
The Governing Body will today consider proposals to set up a
biotechnology company jointly with industry, which will
effectively make Imperial College's fermentation pilot plant a
commercial unit.
As far back as November 1981 it was revealed in .Xew Scientist that
the College were gathering information on possible links with industry
in order to offset the ^100,000 loss which the pilot plant currently runs
at.
O n February 5 a financial sub-committee of Governing Body
instructed College Secretary M r John Smith to negotiate the formation
of a company called Imperial Biotechnology. M r Smith will submit his
information today, although he is unwilling to reveal which industrial
company or companies are concerned.
In November's .Xew Scientist article it was stated that Technical
Development Capital, the venture capital arm of the investment house
finance for Industry, were discussing the venture. T h e plant would be
used to produce enzymes commercially and hence far less time would
be available for research. T h e extent of control which the College
could retain is uncertain.
It is known that some of the 35 members of Governing Body are very-
concerned about the possible elicits of the involvement of big business
in British universities. A statement is expected by the end of the month.
On the box again
Beeb films at IC
Imperial College Union will be featured on television once
again this year when a programme on overseas students is
broadcast during the Easter vacation.
A television crew from the BBC's Open Door were filming at I C
yesterday and interviewed a number of foreign students. T h e crew are
filming at Silwood Park today.
Apart from highlighting the plight of overseas students studying at a
British university a n d having to pay lull fees, it is hoped to show that
although current government policy on overseas students is saving
money, it will not be beneficial in the long run.
During the next fortnight the programme will be edited b y the three
sabbatical members of the Executive, S T O I C C h a i r m a n M r L a w r e n c e
VVindley and M r Nick L a m b r o u , Vice C h a i r m a n of the Overseas
Students Committee. It will be broadcast on B B C 2 at 6:30pm o n
Saturday, April 17.
