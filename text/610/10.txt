Death is My Trade, Cert A, German film,
English subtitles. Directed by Theodor
Totuila. Opened Paris Pullman yesterday.
A sombre, humourless tale that reflects its
subject matter; the life story of the Comman-
dant of Auscwitz concentration camp. The
central character is called Franz Lang, the
pseudonym adopted by the real life character,
Rudolf Hoss, while on the run before his trial
and execution in 1947.
The film follows Lang's life from the age of
sixteen in the First World War and shows the
formation of his strong respect and fanatical
desire to obey an abstract entity: Deutschland.
The S S are shown in a most harrowing
manner, dealing with Jews as "units" and
Death is My Trade is played in a very low
Lang is given a job to do and never doubts that
it is wrong, as authority has deemed him the
best man for the job. He would prefer to be
fighting at the front but as authority want him
to remain commandant to take care of Hitler's
Final Solution, he stays on, never questionning
Reichfuhrer Himmler, who has told him that
the Final Solution is necessary. H e seeks only
ways to improve his efficiency—he invents the
gas chamber!
Death is my Trade is played in a very low
key, it steers clear of shocking news reel
f o o t a g e , w o r k i n g o n t h e p r i n c i p l e that
everyone already knows of the atrocities of the
SS. It is not a film about the victims but a film
about the murderers, men who were not born
to decimate a race but to whom it came with
relative ease whem commanded by authority.
More hideous crimes have been committed
in the name of obedience than have ever been
c o m m i t t e d in the name of rebellion. A n
enthralling, well-acted, very serious film.

Alternative London. Edited by Georganne
D o w r i e s , Kathy Holme and Max Handley.
Price £3.50 from all (in)decent bookshops.
A t last! T h e long awaited (since 1977) new
edition of Alternative London was officially
published yesterday.
Alternative London has always been a
c o n t r o v e r s i a l b o o k but this latest edition
certainly knocks spots off its predecessors.
This is not the book to tell you about the
history of the Tower of London, but rather the
route of Magnox Flask traffic to Windscale.
Subjects covered are sometimes general in
nature a n d bear no real relation to London
itself, so the text is peppered with useful
addresses to put it back on the right track
again. Topics covered included squatting, sex,
strange religions, t a x , dole, drugs (very
comprehensive!), etc., etc. Nothing seems out
of place in Alternative London, it tries to be
c o m p r e h e n s i v e a n d I t h i n k it a c t u a l l y
succeeds.
Probably the only worthwhile book on living
(as opposed to holidaying) in the Big City.
The book has information that will appeal to
all sorts of people, though naturally the
enthusiasts who produced it assume only left-
wingers are really interested. This is my only
criticism (although now and again I found
myself doubting the validity of some of the
information). Strange interesting facts abound:
d i d y o u k n o w t h a t t h e s e x a t t r a c t a n t
advertised in gentlemen's magazines is the
same as "Boarmate" used by farmers at a fifth
of the price to speed up pig mating? D o you
know the "best" magistrate (by name) to be
done by for possesion of grass/hash? O r that
Hitler owned 8,960 acres of Colorado. Not a
lot of people know that.
While the book has something for everyone
and I wholeheartedly recommend every single
one of you to go out and buy a copy, it will no
doubt appeal most to those few interested in
'Alternative I C . Perhaps we could get together
some day to publish it: heating tunnels, Arthur,
Wally and the Freemasons, naughty blueprints
confidential documents, the reflectory flat
voyeur, corruption in high places, the lot!
Could be fun!

Sunday saw a club expedition to Bisley, a
practice for next week's i n t e r - C C U full-bore
competition. While the Mines team travelled
in luxury (Kev's car!), R C S and the n o m i n a l .
Guilds contingent travelled by B R , allowing
the M i n e s t e a m s o m e p s y c h o l o g i c a l
advantage on the range. H a v i n g completed
the formalities of hiring the guns, etc., the
group adjourned to the 900yd range for a
spot of shooting..
Once shooting commenced, everybody
i m m e d i a t e l y h i t t h e targets w i t h the
exception of the esteemed Guilds team, who
suffered wind problems. In the afternoon
good scores were registered by everybody
with the exception of Gary Smith, with
notable achievements by Steve, Neill and
Tony, who notched up 47 apiece. A late
a t t r a c t i o n was a n i m p r o m p t u k n e e l i n g
competition between Gary and Steve, in
which Steve achieved a notable victory by
one point, thus adding to Gary's growing
complex. Fashion on the range showed a
good deal of imagination and dress sense with
stunning outfits being modelled by Steve and '
K e v , with Neill's hat showing promise for the
future.
Yacht
In the beginning there were fourteen pseudo-
queasy quasi-sailors and two O O D 34 yachts.
T h e n G o d (or s o m e o n e w h o s o u n d e d
remarkably like H i m ) spaketh unto us:
" H e y you guys, verily thou shalt saileth
upon the Solent."
So naturally, we went there last weekend.
A n d lo! It blew. Twas really brillig. Behold,
we had a gale to amuseth ourselves with;
which we d i d . O K , so it's not far from
Lymington to Gosport and back again, but
'twas a wizard caper in that wind. A n d lo!
We were amused.
So if you are turned on by the idea of
walking around wearing a rather soggy halo,
come to a meeting in the Botany C o m m o n
Room, Beit A r c h , 12:30pm Thursdays. There
is another trip in a weekend's time, also a
w e e k ' s s a i l i n g i n the E a s t e r v a c a t i o n ,
probably across to France (and back?).
Tennis
In the first match of the season, a weakened
I C t e a m , l a c k i n g m a t c h p r a c t i c e , were
beaten by Reading University first team.
Star performances by R a l p h D a u d and
Rob Easton saved the day for I C , by winning
all their matches. Christian also played well.
M a n y thanks to Steve for getting out of
bed a n d t u r n i n g u p as a last m i n u t e
replacement. (I hope she kept the bed warm
for you when you got back!)
Team: R. Easton, R. Daud, Christian, D.
