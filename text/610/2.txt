Dear Mark
I would like, through you,
to a d d r e s s the C h a p l a i n
(David Ashforth, for those not
in the know). It seems, M r
A s h f o r t h t h a t we a r e to
tolerate the unjust way in
w h i c h the S o u t h A f r i c a n
p o w e r s t h a t be, treat the
m a j o r i t y of people in the
c o u n t r y , s i m p l y because it
would be "unrealistic" to do
otherwise. M y mind shud-
ders, boggles and is generallv
left in a state of complete and
utter confusion at the thought
o f l i v i n g in a country deprived
of such essentials as wedding
rings, masonry drills, printed
circuits and the myriad other
i t e m s t h a t y o u r i n f o r m e d
m i n d has cited. M y position
as regards to your views M r
Ashforth, is not totally disap-
probationary. It does have a
certain twisted logic about it.
Is it not the case that the
English cricketers currently in
South Africa needed all that
l o v e l y m o n e y the S o u t h
Africans offered them? Given
this, surely it was 'unrealistic'
to expect them to turn down
the offer to play in S A . Is your
p o s i t i o n any different, M r
Ashforth?
" W e can in the meantime
concentrate on improvements
that are possible" states M r
Ashforth. Y o u know the type
of thing. Pressure on British
companies, with ties in S.A.,
cultural boycotts, lectures to
skilled tradesmen emigrating
to S.A I mean things of
c a t a c l y s m i c a n d c o s m i c a l
consequence, the lull works!
Really, M r Ashforth....this is
realism? If so it is worse than
complacency, it is outright
and blatent support for the
S o u t h A f r i c a n oppressors
(assuming, of course, that not
all sentient beings are afflicted
by the type of logical thought
that you very evidently suffer
from). I urge you M r Ashforth
to generalise. If you were a
b l a c k S o u t h A f r i c a n , a n d
were l i v i n g in the present
dcgredation the white regime
now subjects you to, and you
had seen your parents and
b r o t h e r s a n d sisters a n d
g r a n d p a r e n t s subjected to
such degradation, and were
conscious that lor generations
your family had been sub-
jected to similar and worse
d c g r e d a t i o n , w o u l d y o u r
definition, M r Ashforth, of
' r e a l i s t i c ' measures against
S o u t h A f r i c a r e m a i n u n -
changed?

Dear Sir
There is in our College an
e x a m p l e of d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
b e s i d e w h i c h the S o u t h
African cricket tour pales into
insignificance. I am referring
to W I S T (Women in Science
and Technology), an organi-
sation that has consistently
relused admission to men. I
demand that this organisation
re-name itself " P e o p l e In
Science a n d T e c h n o l o g y " ,
otherwise we will stop playing
rugby against them.
I remain, sir, your humble
and obedient servant,

Dear Mark
I should like to comment on
the anonymous F E L I X review
of Mad Max 2. First of all,
could anyone actually under-
stand the review? A n example
of the unintelligible style is
given below:
" M a x eventually ends up
defending a type of city state
which has sprung up around
a n o i l w e l l d e g e n e r a t i n g
mechanisms being the most
sort-after asset, a n d w h i c h
provides, for M a x , a mitigating
circumstance, of sorts, lor the
e n s u i n g s l a u g h t e r as he
decimates the hallucinogenic
assortment of bikes, ranging,
from the strangely punk-like,
mohicans and bondage, to
stylised gladiators, who are
laying siege."
It is an interesting review,
seeming to possess the maxi-
m u m amount of commas and
m i n i m u m number of sentences
possible in a given length.
We are told in the following
h a l f - p a r a g r a p h that M a x ' s
dog appears to survive:
" A l l individual characters
except M a x and his faithful
dog are ultimately dispensable
in form, with M a x ' s mad,
violent vision, derived from
pre-holocaust assumptions,
requiring only the occurance
of c h a r a c t e r to c o n s t r u e
action."
Yet during the film, M a x ' s
dog is quite clearly shot with a
crossbow, and the two charac-
ters who survive are M a x and
the alxnigne hoy.
T h e review concluded b*
saying the film is trash.
Mad Max 2 is not the sort ol
film I would go and see but I
was invited to the premier in
Chelsea and found it a grip-
ping film and would recom-
mend it to anyone.

Dear Mark
M a r c o Ledwold's decision
to declare a U G M card vote
"unconstitutional" confirms
the long standing suspicion of
I C students that their elected
officers have become a self-
c o n g r a t u l a t o r y , s e l f - p e r -
petuating, incompetent clique
who do not give a toss about
the v i e w s of the a v e r a g e
student.
Last week the U G M voted
against their advice to ratify
the e l e c t i o n o f t h e n e w
sabbaticals, because accord-
ing to the view of the student
body the objections lodged
were valid. A n d it is up to no-
one to overturn their inter-
p r e t a t i o n o f t h e r u l e s . I
s u p p o s e the fact t h a t a l l
candidates signed a piece of
paper that they would abide
by election rules other than those
laid down by the Constitution was
not a valid objection! Indeed,
the fact that the candidates
a n d M a r c o a c t e d " u l t r a
vires" themselves during the
e l e c t i o n , w a s o n e o f t h e
winning arguments against
r a t i f i c a t i o n p u t f o r w a r d
during the U G M . It is inter-
