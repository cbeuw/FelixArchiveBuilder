Elections
Those who haven't just fell into a gibbering
heap at the mention of the word may be
interested in a few comments on the sabbatical
elections.
Firstly, any suggestion that the Presidential
election should be re-run is nonsense. Steve
Goulder was constitutionally elected. I feel that
if the advice given in FELIX affected any of the
elections adversely, then it was the D P and
H o n Sec elections where twice as many people
abstained as in the Presidential election. Thus
if any elections should be re-run for this reason
then it is these two. However, I don't think that
m y a d v i c e m a d e that m u c h d i f f e r e n c e ,
although I admit that I made a mistake by
saying that an election could be re-run if
nobody passes quota due to abstentions. This
is wrong for several reasons, primarily because
it would severely disadvantage any election
where three or more good candidates stood.
But the real reason that the Presidential
election was messed up is easier to find. Bob
Holding succeeded in making the whole thing a
farce. H e carried out a rabid anti-Goulder
campaign which culminated in a weighted
U G M w h i c h decided not to ratify Steve
Goulder purely because he won, rather than
for any other reason. The irony is that if Bob
Holding had not stood at all, then the result

would have been much clearer. I expect that
either Steve Goulder or Andrew Lyall would
have been a clear winner (ignoring that wimp
J . Martin Taylor who has turned out to be the
worst loser in the history of Imperial College).
But this, like so m u c h else about these
elections, is only speculation and you can't re-
run an election on that.
Finally, now that M r Goulder has been
ratified I urge you to forget all the bitching and
give him your support. I hope that he will be an
able President who will do his best to protect
and improve IC Union.

Soapbox article. Unfortunately I cannot print
all of them and chose one (the longest) from
Frank James. Whilst this letter is abnormally
long I think that it sums up the arguments in
