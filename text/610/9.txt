The Portage to San Cristobel of A.H.
Directed by John Dexter. Mermaid
Theatre.
Is it possible that Hitler may still be alive?
Some people have their fears. His last reported
movements left behind a trail of puzzling
i m p r i n t s a n d t h e r e a p p e a r s to be n o
incontrovertible truth that he died in that
b u n k e r . This nagging fear is exploited in
George Steiner's fictional work The Portage to
San Cristobel of A.H., adapted for the stage by
Christopher Hampton.
The ninety-year-old Hitler, played by Alec
McCowen, is found in the Brazilian jungle by a
commando of Israeli agents. They secretly
attempt to convey him to the airstrip at San
Cristobal, but the sensational news of his
capture is leaved out. Governments through-
out the world start flapping their wings and in
no time at all vultures are preparing to swoop
down for the kill. A s the Jewish commandos
hack their way through the jungle they are
tormented by the hostility of their surround-
ings and by the presence of their horrifying
prey. What possible sentence could befit the
enormity of his crime? Would hanging him not
create the illusion that the whole affair could
be concluded by this one act? Could he even
be a Jew, the Second Messiah foretold in
Jewish mystical scripts?
Most of the time Hitler stumbles along in
silence, but towards the end he delivers an
e l e c t r i c s e l f - j u s t i f i c a t i o n , an a t t e m p t e d
vindication of his policy of racial extermina-
tion, pent up but unforgiving after thirty-five
years of seclusion. M c C o w e n (famous for his
two hour long solo renditions of St. Mark's
Gospel) plays a grizzly, stooping nonagenarian
who from his wasted body manages to hurl
words with gruff but piercing eloquence. A
Alec McCown as Hitler in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.
thrilling piece of drama, his twenty-five minute
monologue delivers a sharp blow to one's
senses. His arguments are that the Third Reich
was no more than a grotesque parody on the
racism of the Jews; their obsession as being
the chosen people. That the utopia erected by
the Jews throughout their long history, and
notably, in the last two thousand years those
erected by Rabbi Jesus and Rabbi Marx, are
impossible to achieve, w o u l d leave m a n
permanently guilty, and bring about the
destruction of civilisation. A n d that the crimes
of Stalin are infinitely greater than his own.
Hitler's speech enters a region of moral
argument very plausible but very dangerous. It
is not a vindication of Naziism but provokes a
debate about good and evil, and in particular
that most ancient of dilemmas, does the good
end justify the evil m e a n s ? T h e s p e e c h
exposes our own hypocrisy s u c h as our
alliance with Stalin in the war, a man who
before had slaughtered thirty million of his own
people in the Russian Revolution.
Despite the foregoing the play is not 'heavy'.
However, it is a little lop-sided in that the great
final speech makes the first part of the play
seem, on reflection, a little tame. A n d superb
use is made of 'surround-sound'.
The theatre is close to Blackfriars tube
station on the district/circle line and student
standbys are available.

The Book of Lech Walesa, various
authors, Penguin £2.50.
This book (according to the blurb) was a
bestseller in Poland until December last year,
when Solidarity was suppressed during the
military takeover. The first six chapters are
essays and recollections about Walesa by
journalists and professors and the like. None
of them are very interesting to read a n d
several of the authors write like windbags. The
best of the first seven chapters is one by Jerzy
Kolodziejski who was Governor of Gdansk
P r o v i n c e ( a c c o r d i n g to the " N o t e s o n
Contributors" on page 11) from 1979 until his
dismissal by the military government early this
year. He was the negotiator on the Govern-
ment side during the strikes in G d a n s k
shipyard in August 1980, which gives him an
unusual point of view for describing Walesa.
His chapter called " H e is Most Certainly a
Tribune of the People", is very sympathetic to
Solidarity and it's better written than the other
essays. Although Kolodziejski is a professor at
a technical university he isn't afraid to say that
" P e o p l e are a bit fed up with all those
professors, clever men who take the country
from one crisis to another". It's a good sign
that someone like him could reach high office
in Poland. There's also a good sign in another
of the accounts: "....Walesa's wife Danuta
went....to have her hair done. While she was
there she heard from one of the two customers
present that 'a fellow (Walesa) has moved in
(nearby) who visited the Primate-Radio Free
Europe broadcast in....they have given him a
whole floor luxuriously appointed.'" This
passage is more revealing than entire chapters
elsewhere in the book because it shows that
(a) Polish housewives are prosperous enough
to be able to have their hair done and (b)
they're unafraid to say in the presence of
strangers that they listen to Western radio
stations (at least they were before the military
takeover). (And it also reveals that Walesa
accepted the authorities' offer of alarge new
flat after he became Solidarity's leader.)
The eighth chapter is a compilation of letters
sent to Walesa by people from all over Poland,
they're mostly fan mail. Chapter 9 consists of
extracts from recollections sent in by people in
r e s p o n s e 10 an a p p e a l f r o m the P o l i s h
Sociological Association. Their tone is much
the same as the letters and they're repetitive.
C h a p t e r 10 is an interview with another
w i n d b a g , A n d r z e j W a j d a , director of the
boring films Man of Marble and Man of Iron.
The last chapter is the transcription of an
interview with Lech Walesa, and it's by a long
way the best part of the book. The inter-
viewers ( M a r z e n a a n d T a d e u s z W o z n i a k )
asked deliberately provoking questions and
the replies from Walesa are fascinating. For
e x a m p l e : " . . . . y o u see yourself as s i n c e r e ,
honest and frank, do you?" "That's right."
FELIX, March 12, 1982 .
"Would you say that those were desirable
qualities in the field of politics?" "What I meant
was....look, obviously you can't say everything
there is to say. A n d even though I can and do
answer every question put to me, I can't be
expected to reveal every single detail." "So
you are a tactician "
The contrast between Walesa's straight
forwardeness and the oiliness of politicians
(such as student union leaders) is marvellous,
and this chapter makes the pages and pages of
praise for W a l e s a elsewhere in the b o o k
almost superfluous. He makes some inter-
esting suggestions too: "Before we go ahead
(with a strike), we (should) have talks with
pensioners and orphanages and find out how
many cars they need. A n d then, all the cars
that are manufactured during the strike are
handed over to people free of charge....we
don't give the government anything." Again:
"Things can't go on the way they are at
present with railwaymen getting free travel and
me not getting it because I don't work on the
railways. Miners dig the coal, so they'll get an
extra ton of coal each—what's socialist about
that?" (Imagine how M r s Thatcher would reac!
to the first suggestion, or Arthur Scargill to tht
second.)
In spite of the boring passages this is a good
book and it would be well worth buying if it
w a s n ' t for the high p r i c e . T h e b o o k is
advertised as a "special rush publication" and
it does seem that Penguin are cynically trying
to cash in on the Polish crisis.
