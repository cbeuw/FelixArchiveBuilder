Our Annual General Meeting is to
be held on Tuesday, March 23, in
P h y s i c s L e c t u r e Theatre 2. If
enough people stand for commit-
tee posts, then next year should
see the bookstalls running proper
ly in both departments, sufficient
p o s t e r s will be m a d e , m o r e
lectures can be held, more people
will attend, more visits can be
a r r a n g e d , a n d we will have a
Mathematical and Physical Soci-
ety, instead of a Physics Society
with a few members from the
maths department. So, we need:
President; V P (Maths): V P (Phy-
sics); Internal Secretary; External
S e c r e t a r y ; T r e a s u r e r ; Publicity
Officer (Maths); Publicity (Phy-
sics); Bookstall Manager (Maths);
B o o k s t a l l M a n a g e r ( P h y s i c s ) .
P a p e r s a r e now up in b o t h

Photosoc
Candidates are invited to stand for
the following posts on next year's

T r e a s u r e r , D a r k r o o m Officer,
Colour Group Leader, Publicity

Candidates must have a pro-
poser and two seconders, who
should be members of the society.
Election papers will be put up on
the noticeboard in the U n i o n
Building Entrance Hall on Mon-
day, March 22, and will be taken
down on Friday, April 30. The
A G M will be held on Monday,
May 3.
UN Soc
This Tuesday we are lucky to have
a representative of the Canadian
High Commission giving a talk on
"The Canadian Nuclear Policy".
This should be very interesting
due to Canada's recent change in
attitude, banning nuclear weapons
on their soil. Would an action such
as this be practical in Britain? Why
not come along and find out.
First week of next term we will
be holding the A G M . Please come
along if you are at all concerned
about issues affecting the quality
of life for any section of mankind.
Industrial Soc
The dinner on Monday was great
fun and good value—we all pigged
ourselves.
Main news is Norman Tebbit,
the Minister for Employment, is
coming to College on April 29, i.e.
first Thursday of next term. To
entice him along, we decided to
approach Consoc, who obviously
hold more sway over a big Tory,
with a view to a joint event. So
watch out for that
Unfortunately the trip to Lotus
Cars was called off at the last
minute because the I C U minibus
had to go into dock—some oaf
had apparently "broken off the
prop shaft". This event will be
rescheduled for next year, i.e.
October, so apologies to third
years!

Scout & Guide
Well, we did it. Forty-two miles of pure masochism across the north York
moors. Friday saw the start of a very special S & G weekend. Our aim was
to complete an east to west crossing of the Lyke Wake Walk, starting
from the radio mast at Ravenscar. We arrived a t two in the morning and
after an initial cup of coffee we set off into the night.
By the time we reached the first checkpoint, the blisters h a d begun t o
take their toll, Austin needing the biggest repair job. As we walked o n , the
dawn broke over the impressive Fylingdales "golfballs" and t h e light
helped us pick our way through the heather to the next butty stop.
Then came the bogs. Bog techniques vary, from skipping (Vicky) t o
swimming (Jenny) but everyone made it to the breakfast stop, although
the party had now split up somewhat. Eight miles of "graunch" along a
disused railway line followed, dropping down onto the last butty stop.
Andy dropped out, but then had his mind changed by our hero back-
up support team, Malcolm. The last stage gave everyone an opportunity
for a good " w i n g e " as we staggered the last ten miles back t o
Osmotherley.
Having arrived at the hut, we discovered to our dismay that there w e r e
steps up to the sleeping room! The next day was spent falling asleep i n
the pub and, due to our various aches and pains, doing the " L y k e Wake
Silly Walk".
SF Soc
Not a happy bulletin this week I'm
afraid. It is with regret that I inform
you of the death of two science
fiction writers. Y o u may have
heard that Edmund Cooper died
because he used to review books
for The Times and they therefore
acknowledge his existence. What
you may not know is that Philip K.
D i c k d i e d e a r l i e r this m o n t h .
Anyone with any knowledge of the
SF field must admit that he was
one of the "greats" with a list of
books of high quality as long as
your arm. Fortunately, his com-
mand of English was better than
mine. Alas, you'll be lucky if you
see any o b i t u a r i e s a n y w h e r e
except in the specialist publica-
tions. Space does not permit me
to give him his due.
Complete change of subject.
O n Tuesday we show Night of the
Lepus in Mech Eng 220, 6:30pm,
etc., etc. This is a special Easter
presentation as this film involves a
stampede of giant killer rabbits.
Paragraphs contrasting more than
these are hard to find.
ICCAG
We have now moved to the Rag
Committee Room which is oppo-
site the lift on the top floor of the
Union. Meetings as usual, Monday
12:30.
Last week we had David Hunter
from Task Force to talk to us. H e
described the projects they are
involved in with old people. They
can arrange for a young person to'
visit a pensioner o n a regular
basis. They also arrange trips for
the p e n s i o n e r s w h i c h r e q u i r e
energetic young helpers. Inter-
ested? If so, get in touch.
We have our own links with old
p e o p l e : v i s i t i n g t h e m at S t .
Pancras Hospital or at a h o n e on
High Street Kensington.
Soup Runs as usual on Tues-
days and Fridays.
We need helpers to build an
adventure playground on Wed-
nesday afternoons in Acton for
the handicapped children we help
w i t h o n S a t u r d a y a f t e r n o o n s .
Come forward all you budding
engineers and put it in practice!
See you soon!
Astrosoc
T h i s T u e s d a y , M a r c h 2 3 , at
6:30pm in Physics L T 2 , Astrosoc
is proud to welcome Dr Chris
I s h a m f r o m the T h e o r e t i c a l
Physics Group. The subject of his
lecture will be "Quantum Gravity",
discussing the problems involved
in r e c o n c i l i n g c l a s s i c a l a n d
relativistic gravitational theories
with the modern quantum mech-
anical view of the other physical
forces, especially as we delve
deeper into the heart of the atom
and distances as small as 10"3 3
cm
h a v e to be c o n s i d e r e d . T h i s
promises to be a very interesting
and intriguing lecture to which
everyone is welcome. There will
e v e n be c o f f e e a n d b i s c u i t s
afterwards for those with the
strength of will to resist the call of
Dr Who.
Not to be outdone by any other
club or society, on the following
Thursday, at 1:00pm in Physics
LT2, we will be holding our A G M ,
with all the usual annual reports
a n d e l e c t i o n s for n e x t y e a r ' s
committee. The papers will be up
until Wednesday, so if you want to
stand for any post (and you are an
Astrosoc member!), drag yourself,
a proposer and two seconders
over to the Union Entrance Hall
and sign your life away. And don't
forget to come to the AGM on
Thursday!
