Next Tuesday (March 23) we are
proud to present a fun evening in
the Southside Bar (Stan's). Ace
buskers "Pookiesnackenburger"
(who recently supported Madness)
will be there, as will an extremely
large v i d e o - s c r e e n showing
several hours worth of videos
featuring such heroes as: Bow
Wow Wow, Grace Jones, Davie
Bowie, and New Order, to name
but a few.
We almost forgot to mention
the cheap beer yes! Cheap
Beer! Admission is only £1.
Next week's film is The Great
Rock'n'Roll Swindle staring
several infamous people.
WIST
WIST is the IC women's group,
and is the only active repre-
sentation of women here. As you
will read further on; we are holding
a WIST evening on Wednesday,
March 24, and hope that as many
people as possible will come, since
members interested in learning
more about the position of women
at IC and the outside world are
badly needed. Our activities this
year have included a questionnaire
sent out to all women in College to
find out why more women seem to
follow scientific rather than
engineering courses. We have also
invited a number of speakers from
organizations such as WAVAW
(Women Against Violence Against
Women), a Polish women's group,
biological theories on women,
women in the media. Wc are also
hoping to organize and host a
national conference on Women in.
Science and Technology at IC
next autumn.
So, please come along and find
out more about WIST, which
meets regularly on Tuesday
lunchtimes in the Union Upper
Lounge.
We also have some leaflets and
books (to borrow) at the Socialist
Bookstall during this F r i d a y
lunchtime.

Silly Sale - Silly Sale
Books at silly prices. Ballpens at stupid prices. 1982 Diaries at
ridiculous prices. Starts Monday, March 22, 1982.
"I was staggered when Toni brought the manuscript for this book
to us at the National ZX80 and ZX81 Users' Club. We'd talked
about it, and Toni had given us a broad outline of the contents of
the book. But until I had the chance to read it, I did not realise just
what a comprehensive and easy to understand work it would be."
So sayeth Tim Hartnell of the National Z X 8 0 and ZX81 Users'
Club. When shown this book by Toni Baker, a third year at
Imperial College.

Thanks goodness we've gotridof
those two lumps of metal at last. I
was beginning to think they would
never go. Thanks to all those who
bought annual dinner tickets, it's a
pity more of you didn't.
The main events remaining are
a Rag Mag trip to Guildford on
Wednesday (12 people only) and
the Paris trip at the very end. So
far about 25 people are going, but
ask Simon Moore, LS2, if any
places remain (post-dated cheques
welcome).
Next term is the Silwood Ball, a
gentle evening at a country house,
with buffet, dancing and enter-
tainment. The date set is May 7,
and ticket reservations are already
coming in, so make sure you are
not disappointed.
Congratulations to the P G team
for winning the Rugby Sevens on
Saturday, but thanks to everyone
for turning out.
Elections are next Thursday;
so, if you're thinking of standing
for something sign up quickly.
Tomorrow (Saturday, March
20) is the Deaf Kiddies Party in
S C R Southside (2:00-5:00pm).
Please come along and help during
the afternoon. Anyone wishing to
help with the food, see me today.
Gaynor
Snooker
In the frantic rush to complete the
league, matches have been played
all over the place. The B, at very
short notice, beat Bedford 4-1, but
then slipped up against the A
team, losing 4-1, with Hurford
saving the whitewash. Things are
now looking pretty good for the A
team.
This Sunday saw Mr C . Tripp
claim his place at the top of the
league rankings by winning the
U L U Championship. It was a good
day for IC all round, with Simpkin
finishing runner-up and Gaskill
turning in a fine performance.
The Club A G M will be held on
Thursday, March 25, at 5:30pm in
the Snooker Lounge. All members
are entitled to attend and vote for
next year's executive. This will be
followed by the club annual
dinner, details of which can be
found in the Snooker Room.
Another forthcoming attraction
is the final of the IC Open between
Tripp and Calvert. This promises
to be a classic match, so look out
for the time and place on the
noticeboard.
