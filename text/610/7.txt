There is a very large branch of puzzles which
up to now has been totally ignored in this
column, which is a great pity since it includes
many of my favourites. I a m referring to
manipulative puzzles, the type where you have
to remove a string from a wire shape, or slide a
wooden bead along a cord, or dismantle and
reassemble a set of w o o d e n b l o c k s . F o r
obvious reasons it is quite difficult for me to set
a puzzle of this type as a prize puzzle, but a
few weeks ago someone showed me an idea
which enables me to set a manipulative puzzle
using nothing more than a rectangular sheet of
paper.
1. Obtain from somewhere an ordinary
sheet of paper. The size and quality are
unimportant, but it must be rectangular. If you
are reading this at 9:30 on Friday morning, you
could while away a boring lecture (and annoy
the lecturer) by using a sheet from your
notepad. O r you could try the puzzle in any
other situation where there is a plentiful supply
of rectangular sheets of paper. Anyhow, take
the sheet, fold it in half, score the crease
heavily, and unfold again.
2. Fold it in half the other way, then in half
again. Once more score the creases heavily,
and open the sheet out flat. Four creases
s h o u l d n o w d i v i d e the p a p e r i n t o eight
congruent rectangles.
3. Number the rectangles as shown in the
figure.

Easter
A r e m i n d e r of the benefits w h i c h some
students may be entitled to apply for this
Easter vacation, especially those paying rent.
For a more detailed description call in at
Student Services, 15 Princes Gardens for our
h a n d o u t sheet a n d i n d i v i d u a l a d v i c e if
required.
Unemployment Benefit
This can be claimed if you are available for
work during the vacation and have earned at
least £1,350 between April 1980 to April 1981,
or £975 between April 1979 to April 1980.
A n y o n e w h o qualifies will receive £25pw
provided they 'sign on' the first week day of the
vacation and when required thereafter.
Supplementary Benefit
Any student who pays rent over the vacation
and can 'sign on' at the D H S S office in the area
4. Turn the paper over, and number the
reverse of the rectangles so that each has the
same number on both sides.
5. Without tearing the paper, fold it along the
creases so that the rectangles lie on top of each
other in the order 1 5 6 4 8 7 3 2.
6. Send the thing to me at the F E L I X Office,
together with comments and criticisms.

Last Week's Solution
Eight is the smallest number of triangles (see
diagram). Andrew Powell, Physics 2, was the
only person to find this.
Previous Week's Solution
The problem, you will recall, was to find which
of twelve coins was of different weight from the
others using three weighings to be determined
Benefits
where the accommodation is, should be able
to claim part or all of their rent back since this
expenditure is not allowed for in the vacation
element of the grant and effectively reduces a
student's income to below subsistence level
during this period. It is important to go to the
J o b C e n t r e early on the first day of the
vacation in order to get the full entitlement.
Rent Allowances and Rate Rebates
If you are paying rent and will be going home
for the whole of the Easter vacation this may
be the only benefit available to you. It can be
applied for at any time from the Town Hall for
the area where you are paying rent. Normally
they will assess you on the basis of your
termtime income (£54pw) and it will be up to
you to contact them after the vacation to re-
assess it on your income for that period
(£21.50).
FELIX, March 19, 1982
before the results of any of the weighings are
known. I am grateful to Andy Strangeways for
the following mnemonic for the solution. Letter
the coins with the letters of the phrase F A M
N O T L I C K E D . Then the phrase M A D O L I K E
M E T O FIND F A K E C O I N tells you to weigh
M A D O against LIKE, M E T O against F I N D
and F A K E against C O I N . These weighings will
always determine the fake.
...And The Week Before...
This caused so much confusion that I shall give
both the right way and the wrong way to do it.
First, the wrong way. From Amble's last
statement, we get B - A - 2 C - D is greater
than or equal to zero. We know A . B . C . D
equals 270 (=2.3.3.3.5) and since A is the
smallest of the four, A is 2 or 3. The case A=3 is
easily eliminated, leaving A=2, C=D=3 and
B=15.
The right way takes into account the fact
that 1 is also a factor of 270. Amble told the
C a p t a i n that everyone w h o a t t e n d e d the
display visited just one of the four stalls, from
w h i c h the C a p t a i n c o u l d d e d u c e t h a t
A+B+C+D=K for some value K w h i c h he
knows (but we don't). A n d this was not
enough for the Captain to work out the values
of A , B, C, and D. So K has a value which
makes the simultaneous equations
A+B+C+D=K
A . B . C . D = 270
have more than one solution. There are four
such values:
1+1+15+18 = 35 = 1+2+5+27
1+2+9+15 = 27 = 1+3+5+18
1+3+9+10 = 23 = 2+3+3+15
2+3+5+9 = 19 = 3+3+3+10
Amble's additional information enables the
Captain to work out the correct numbers as 2,
3, 3, and 15.
...And Ages Ago
Finally, there were several misprints in Zar
Amrolia's solution to the piano moving puzzle
in the Christmas FELIX. The correct solution
goes: U U , left timp U , other timp R, D L L ,
t i m p U one u n i t , R D R ( U L ) U L ( L D )
D R R U U L L D (DR) R R D L L U U R D R U L U (RU)
L D D R D L (UL) U U R (RD) D (DR) R U L D , D
one unit, L , music stands U , music stands U ,
R, lower timp D , grand piano R, D L L L L U R D D
R U (LU) U L L D R R U (UL) L.
When claiming S B and R & R rebates the
following information will normally be needed:
proof of rent payable (letters can be obtained
from Student Services for those in the Head
Tenancies), copy of grant allocation, recent
bank statement, plus any documents relating
to other income or investments. If heating and
hot water is included in your rent this reduces
the amount eligible for a refund by about £6pw,
unless you can get some form of documentary
evidence that it is less (we can provide this for
claimants living in Halls and Houses).
Dental charges go up again on April 1, so it
might be worth getting an appointment in
before that date if you are over 19. However,
during the vacation it should be possible for
most students to get a refund, while those on
Supplementary Benefit are automatically
exempt (ask for the exemption certificate
while you're at the D H S S office). If you have a
rent committement of around £25pw it may
also be possible to claim back charges during
termtime. D H S S leaflets on N H S dental
treatment, medical treatment during visits

obtained from the Student Services Office.
