Cross Country
The penultimate race of the season, the O l d
B o y s ' R a c e , was h e l d on S a t u r d a y i n
R i c h m o n d Park in bright sunshine. A small
contingent of about half a dozen present I C
runners braved the competition all to no
avail, as a large majority of the first ten
finishers were old boys. A notable exception
was H u g h D i x o n , our guest runner from
Q E C , who won the five mile race. As is
traditional, after slight numerical m a n i p u -
lation the result was deemed a draw.
The dinner that followed the run later in
the evening was a tremendous success with
copious quantities of high quality cold bullet
edibles. Towards the end of the evening our
Captain, Pete Holdsworth, provided a little
light entertainment with his speech including
c o m m e n t s on the t e a m a n d i n d i v i d u a l
successes a n d failures d u r i n g the season
together with a few amusing anecdotes.

Firsts
This game was played on the astroturf at
Crystal Palace against St. Johns touring side
(full o! drunken bums!). IC dominated the
first hall and were 3-0 up at half-time.
T h e c h a n g e of u m p i r e s at h a l f - t i m e
allowed St. Johns to score three times in the
second half, but I C m a t c h e d this w i t h
another three.
Notable performances were from Ayers
(four goals) and Franklin on the pitch; and
from St. Johns, and Avers, Bell, Franklin and
Coathangei (IC) in the bar afterwards.
St. Johns lost the boat races in the bar at
the Guilds Bar Night and were shown how to
drink by IC on M o n d a y morning.

Q Sailing
Sailors don't set sail on the 13th—except for
I C sailors that is, who travelled to Oxford last
weekend to sail Oxford University. The boats
were Laser lis which are light, fast and wet.
The wind was strong, which made it difficult
for the I C dirty tricks brigade to use their
usual 'techniques' and the first race consisted
of two I C boats h o t l y p u r s u i n g O x f o r d
around the course whilst practising capsize
drill several times, just to show how it's done.
The second race showed some improve-
ment with Bennett and Dalton lighting each
other for fifth place, whilst Kennedy and his
recovered crew showed how it's really done
and finished first.
After lunch, Oxford's ladies provided the
challenge. Kennedy and Bennett battled it
out with the opposition whilst D a l t o n and
Younghusband realising that they were now
the only dry crew, had encounters with the
starters launch and an Oxford boat before
illustrating the technique of falling overboard
at speed.
W i n n i n g this race on p e n a l t y p o i n t s
proved too close for Oxford, who reacted by
winning the second race decisively and thus
took the match.
Team: Bennett, Dalton, Fawcett, Kennedy,
I ostevin, Younghusband.

Fifths
With one game still outstanding the Fifths
stand proudly top of Division 2 R , a massive
ten points ahead of their nearest rivals K i n g s
Thirds.
The Filths, newly promoted to 2 R , having
lie previous season won 3 R (and also the
serve cup), have completely decimated
their opponents. O n l y R H C II who the Fifths
tteat 3-2 and 3-1 have avoided the Fifths
-coring ten past them in two matches. Goals
-cored a g a i n s t o t h e r t e a m s h a v e b e e n
Goldsmiths 18(3); Barts Hosp 18(2); Q M C
III 13(3); Guys Hosp 11(2); I G I V 11(3);
R H C III 10(3). L o n d o n Hospital II were
thrashed 4-1 away despite numerous first
team imports but were unable to raise a team
for the home match. Kings III who have still
lo play the Fifths in their final game on
M a r c h 24 (spectators welcome) have already
been beaten by the Fifths 8-1 away.

Sixths
The Sixths finished their season as unbeaten
league champions with a final playing record
of:'
P W D I. F A Pts
14 12 2 0 63 16 26
The average of over four goals a game
would have kept a crowd entertained. G o a l
scoring honours were shared by a mixture of
age and experience: the Hying wingers K e n
B a l d w i n a n d Steve C o x . P a u l ' s d e a d l y
finishing produced another eleven, and even
M a r k managed two. Highlights of the season
included: Ken's unselfish attitude towards
opposing keepers; Gary's subtle touches and
thoughtful distribution; Roll's ability to find
the noticeboard once every three weeks; the
only loss of the season—the supporters club to
B R ; Mark's gentle words ol encouragement
on the field; George's Hying headers; Anton's
haircut and Steve's inability to count past
two, so avoiding a strained wallet. It was also
encouraging to see the number of young
keepers that have been blooded towards the
end of the season. Finally, tune in next year
to find out if Trevor ever scores.
