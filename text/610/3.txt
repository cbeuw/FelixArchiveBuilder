Resigns
As p r e d i c t e d last week M i s s
Sarah Laithwaite has resigned
her position as Editor of London
Student. H e r last issue appeared
yesterday.
The reason for her resignation
is that she must sit exams which
she deferred last year at the
London School of Economics.
London Student will still appear
next t e r m , . a l t h o u g h d u e to
financial restrictions there may
be very few issues.
Rent Scheme
Shelved
The alternative method of rent
payment for College Accommo-
dation proposed last week by the
U n i o n P r e s i d e n t h a s b e e n
shelved.
T h e s c h e m e w o u l d h a v e
i n v o l v e d p a y i n g r e n t o v e r
thirty-nine weeks, as opposed to
thirty-one, and c l a i m i n g the rent
paid over the vacations from the
Department of Health and Social
Security.
M a n y residents i n C o l l e g e
H e a d T e n a n c i e s c u r r e n t l y do
this.
However the scheme has been
rejected on moral grounds.
Spanner 'Mislaid'
C i t y and Guilds U n i o n are still
without Spanner and Bolt after
the R o y a l C o l l e g e of S c i e n c e
U n i o n mislaid the items before
the expected handover yesterday.
A new date for the handover has
been decided as 12:30 on W e d -
nesday in the Beit Q u a d .
This meant that the mascots
could not be present at yester-
day's G u i l d s U n i o n M e e t i n g .
Why I over-ruled
a UGM Decision
The Results U G M decision to re-run the sabbatical elections was ultra
vires the constitution because the objections made were not on
constitutional grounds. There are various reasons why an election can
be re-run and the only one that could have been brought up at the
Results U G M was that I, as Returning Officer, had run the elections
unconstitutionally.
There were two main objections raised at the U G M . T h e first was
that people had been misled into thinking that candidates had to pass
quota before they were deemed to be elected. The only place from
where students could have gained this misconception was in M a r k
Smith's editorial in the Manifesto Supplement in F E L I X issue number
608. A n editorial by definition is the personal opinion of the writer and
people should treat it as such and not accept it unquestioningly.
M a r k Smith did not deliberately mislead people and did not bias his
advice towards any one candidate. It is not even certain that his
advice played any major role.
The second objection concerned a written undertaking which all the
candidates signed immediately prior to the count. This stated that
candidates had to pass quota before they could be deemed to be
elected. O n consultation with the Electoral Reforms Society (experts
on proportional representation systems) and on closer examination of
the U n i o n Constitution this was not found to be so. H a d I acted in
accordanc e w i t h this u n d e r t a k i n g I w o u l d have been a c t i n g
unconstitutionally.
Any suggestions that this undertaking inlluenced the outcome of the
elections are ridiculous since it was not made until after votes had been
cast.
Elections C o m m i t t e e are empowered to ratify the sabbatical
elections and this was done before the results were announced at the
U G M . A U G M can only object to that ratification on the grounds of
unconstitutional election procedure. N o objections were raised on these
grounds. The fact that the only objections raised were against the
ratification of the presidential election indicates that people were
objecting to the results and not the procedure. Obviously there were
people who voted for the other presidential candidates but Stephen
Goulder was constitutionally elected and these people should accept
the result.

A look at the figures
Not surprisingly, many students are still confused about the results of
the sabbatical elections. T h e actual voting figures are shown in full
below. Figures in brackets are percentages of total U n i o n membership.
President
Goulder
Lyall
Holding
Taylor
Stage
364

Stage 2

Stage 4

Total valid votes: 1307 (28.57%) Q u o t a 654
Abstentions 156 (3.41%)
Spoilt papers: 25
Goulder is elected at stage 3 (rule 9.2(b) of the V o t i n g Schedule),
but would in any case have exceeded quota after Lyall's votes were
re-allocated.
Deputy President
Stage 1
Greenstreet 838
White 172
Livett 116
Total valid votes: 1126 (24.62%) Q u o t a 564

Greentstreet passes quota at Stage 1 and is elected.
Honorary Secretary

Cryer 239
Total valid votes: 1,118 (24.4%) Q u o t a 560
Abstentions: 317 (0.93%)
Spoilt papers: 36
FYeeman passes quota at Stage 1 and is elected.
A l l quotas are calculated in accordance with rule 4 of the V o t i n g
Schedule (i.e. abstentions are not counted) and are not those orginally
given by the Returning Officer.
The interesting question is how the voting was affected by the
misleading advice given by F E L I X to abstain in order to have the
election rerun. Clearly, if all the people who abstained had spoilt their
ballot papers, the elections for both Deputy President and H o n Sec
would have been inquorate (i.e. less than 25% of U n i o n members h a v i n g
cast a valid vote or an abstention). T h e presidential election, however
would still be quorate with 28.57% voting.
