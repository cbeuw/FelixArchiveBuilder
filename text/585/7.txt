Well Hung!
OVER T H E EASTER Bank Holiday weekend, the
wind was a moderate easterly and the sky was
blue with a few scattered clouds. Perfect weather
conditions to go flying at Pandy in South Wales. I
had also borrowed one of the new fifth generation
hang gliders for the weekend and set off early to
Wales with it strapped down to the roof-rack.
When we arrived I rigged up quickly and was in
the air in forty minutes having launched from an
800ft spur that sticks out from the end of the
ridge. The glider felt superb and I soon gained
1,000ft above take off and was heading out along
the seven miles of barren Welsh mountains that
lay between myself and "the Gap". This is an
upwind jump of about a mile which has to be
crossed before reaching the end of the ridge. I
had been forced to land there two days earlier
and I made sure of crossing it with a ground
clearance of 2600ff.
The end of the ridge was Hay Bluff. A huge
barren block with vertical faces chopping 1,500ft
on all sides. 1 flew along its NE face for a half an
hour just beating backwards and forwards, feeling
the way I was thrown around in the air as a
thermal came through and learning how to circle
in the region of best lift. I was joined by another
pilot and soon after a huge thermal came through
and we both circled back over the Wye Valley
and away from Hay Bluff which grew smaller and
smaller below me.
At 3,500ft I set off downwind and glided five
miles to Telgarth where I picked up another
thermal and lazily corkscrewed into the now
perfectly blue sky up to 4,000ft. I could just see
below me the other glider landing, he had left the
thermal too soon and had been caught in the
surrounding downdraft.
1 flew off down wind in search of my third
thermal but this time things were not so easy. The
lift was weaker and I circled for thirty minutes
drifting downwind slowly covering the miles. 1 was
again getting low and was desperate to find some
more lift....but no....I had to choose a landing field
clear of pylons but near habitation. I found one
three miles south of Brecon and on landing 1 was
met by three amazed local farmers who gave me
local cider and let me phone for my pick-up.
The twenty five miles from Pandy to Brecon via
Telgarth had taken me over two and a half hours
spending most of the time over 2,000ft above the
valleys below.
Surely no other human experience could more
closely approach birdlike flight.

L A S T T H U R S D A Y E V E N I N G , the club held its
annual dinner at the Schooner Inn in Panton St
(breaking the tradition of Mooney meals). The
event went exceptionally well and everybody
enjoyed it enormously (especially those who
collected prizes for winning various Motor Club
events). There were in fact forty-five people
present (we counted them!â€”or was it 46?)
Undoubted star of the evening was Mr Ian
Bracey, the guest speaker, this after dinner
speech commanded the attention of everyone in
the room and tears of laughter were visible in
many an eye. His speech started by dealing with
the early days of his career. After leaving school
with 'the best education money could buy' and
two O Levels, he built his first racing machine, the
'Tiger Strike' where the driver's head was the
back of the car and his feet the front, with the
engine mounted alongside. Mr Bracey then went
on to recount some of the more amusing events
that befell him while racing the car, concluding
with its demise when he got a lapful of red hot
engine remains.
Progressing to his fortunes at Le Mans (the
most prestigious race in the world) he related his
problem of torn loyalties in the year of the
Queen's Jubilee. Deciding to go to Le Mans he
took with him a 22ft flag pole in sections which he
duly raised in the paddock on arrival. Having
taught himself to play the bugle, he proceded to
ceremoniously raise and lower the flag at the
beginning and end of each day. This infuriated the
French who never like to be outdone on the
patriotic front, especially by the British!
In short, Ian Bracey is an Englishman of the
true tradition and is a credit to his country. On a
ridiculously small budget, he has held his own in a
British car against the might of the factory teams
such as B M W , Porsche and Renault. On behalf of
the Motor Club and College as a whole we would
like to wish him the best of luck in this year's 'Le
Mans 24 Hours'.

NovJ tor one final climactic paragraph as the SF
Soc bulletin pushes ever onward, further up and
further in. As our secretary once said, "It's the
handfuls of fruit that bother me". Our library has
expanded beyond belief. Not only have we
bought fourteen new books, but we have placed
those we already have further apart. There will be
no library meetings until further notice. So long
folks, here's waving dangerous flags at you.

F O L L O W I N G THEIR 2-1 massacre of Guilds,
R C S met Mines last Wednesday. The result
was a humiliating experience for Mines, the
present holders of the S t e p h e n s o n C u p .
Although the half-time score was 0-0, R C S
had dominated the game, attacking continu-
ously. Only good defence by Gatley, Newman
a n d s o m e othe r g u y s a v e d M i n e s from
conceding several goals.
The second half saw the continued plight of
a besieged Mines side. For*unately, for Mines,
the p r e s s u r e w a s r e l i e v e d w h e n R C S
retreated to the half-way line following ar
excellently worked free-hit just outside the
'D'. Parker and Hughes working together '.o
produce a good shooting chance for Cope,
the shot a l t h o u g h saved was s l i p p e d to
Sharpe, who duly drilled the ball home.
The game then became deceptively even,
as R C S slacked off, but R C S clinched the
game, when a shot by Taylor was half saved
by the goalkeeper. But a bit of G B H on the
goalkeeper by Hughes eventually resulted in
the ball hitting the back of the net. But no one
quite knows who scored; although general
sympathy was in favour of Taylor.
R C S ' s t r i u m p h a n t r e t u r n to IC w a s
somewhat alcoholic, although John Daving
insisted that the minibus was only weaving
because of the steering.
T E A M : C a p e , Sharpe, Parker, Taylor,
Hughes, Williams, Moran, Leinster. Riley,
Farrington, Rogers.
Football
T H E C L U B has had its most s u c c e s s f u l
season ever with five of our six teams winning
their divisions and the thirds coming fifth in
the same division as the seconds. The fifths
also won their cup, beating L S E IV 1-0 in the
final at Motspur Park.
I should now have the cups and medals and
players who have won them should see me as
soon as possible (Union Office, lunchtimes)
to collect them. We will be having a few drinks
in the Union Bar on Tuesday evening, May 26,
when the silverware will be on show and
medals will be available.
Our firsts have been invited to play in a
' c h a r i t y s h i e l d ' m a t c h a g a i n s t R H C at
Motspur. Anyone who would like to come
along and support should put their name on
the list on the C l u b Noticeboard just outside
the Bar. If there is enough interest the coach
will leave at about 2:00pm on Wednesday,
May 27.
C o n g r a t u l a t i o n s to M i n e s 2 n d XI for
winning Division 4R and many thanks to all
the people who ensured the club's success
this season.

T H E D Y N A M I C new C o m m i t t e e are now
gradually taking over in preparation for a
tremendous, fun-filled, record-breaking time
next year, so be prepared.
The doubles champions are Proudlove and

decided to contest the open final between
themselves as well. The really interesting

progressing slowly, so stop revising (??) for a
moment and go and find your opponent. Put
a notice up on one of the boards if you're not
sure who he is, and arrange a time, or face
immediate and complete disqualification.
