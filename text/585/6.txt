CND
or complacency?
By Owen Greene
THE N U C L E A R arms race has been accelerating
over the last thirty years and nuclear war now
seems a probability. The international tensions
which have generated it, and the role of various
vested interests, are complicated and urgently
require analysis so that people can act to reverse
the process before it is too late. Unfortunately,
articles on nuclear disarmament and C N D are
often simply a mixture of mystification, pseudo-
analysis a n d c o m p l a c e n c y . F r a n k J a m e s '
'Soapbox' article in last week's FELIX is just one
more example of this.
Firstly, "better red than dead" is not a C N D
slogan. Many people think that it contains a grain
of common sense, but to present it, as Frank
James does, as central to CND's position is
ignorant. The rest of the article only boils down to
a reassertion of the views of the military, Reagan,
Thatcher, etc. That is that due to the inherent
expansionism of the USSR, we (i.e. N A T O ) must
continue t o develop o u r nuclear arsenal,
particularly in Europe and China, in order to
contain and deter it. By campaigning against this
policy, C N D is accused of making nuclear war
more likely. There are so many assumptions,
omissions and implications to be challenged in
such assertions that I cannot hope to take them
all up here.
The U S has always been in the lead in the
nuclear arms race. Although the U S S R has
recently caught up in terms of the total explosive
power of its missiles, the U S is still years ahead in
terms of technological sophistication a n d
accuracy. Since the U S had several years head
start, has always spent at least as much as Russia
on nuclear weapons, and has a more highly
developed economy and skilled workforce, it
would be amazing if this wasn't the case. The
present phase in the exalation has largely been
the responsibility of N A T O . I neither admire or
trust the USSR and condemn the invasion of
Afghanistan, etc, etc, but facts are facts.
Both sides had the capability to obliterate a
large proportion of the others population by the
early 1960s, a n d yet the race continued.
"Deterrence" has been obsolete as a meaningful
justification for over a decade, and is now only
retained for its propaganda value. This was
officially confirmed around 1975 with the
Schlesinger doctrine and Presidential Directive
59. Nuclear war is now not only thinkable in the
strategist's mind but also maybe "winnable".
N A T O is now prepared to use nuclear weapons
first in conflict (i.e. "flexible response"). The aim
is t o limit the holocaust to the E u r o p e a n
"theatre". This would clearly involve the total
destruction of European civilisation but the U S
might s u r v i v e r e l a t i v e l y intact with only
acceptable losses (up to about 20 million deaths).
Such a strategy holds little attraction for the
USSR since its obliteration would be certain.
Most of Western Europe is littered with N A T O
nuclear weapons, nearly all of which are entirely
under U S control. It is in this context that C N D ,
along with many other disarmament movements
in Europe, is campaigning for unilateral nuclear
disarmament. Since over 70% of NATO's nuclear
warheads are in submarines it is silly to suggest
that such disarmament would leave the West with
no "deterent". However it would certainly force
strategists to abandon the idea of a "theatre" war
"limited" to Europe.
Frank James can't even find room to pay the
customary lip service to multilateral negotiations.
To those who do pin their hopes on them, I ask
you to reflect on why they have failed up till now.
Unilateralists fully accept the crucial role
multilateral agreements will ultimately play in
securing world nuclear disarmament, but
experience shows that unilateral actions are also
crucial. After all, each step in nuclear armament
is unilateral. Either way, being a (genuine)
multilateralist m e a n s w o r k i n g h a r d f o r
disarmament too! There isn't much time.
