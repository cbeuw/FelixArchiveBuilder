Physics Open Day
Fiasco
Three hundred and fifty sixth formers attended an open day in
the Physics department last Friday. The event, organised by
students, was intended to give A Level students interested in
science a chance to look at an undergraduate department, and
was not intended to be any form of recruiting exercise.
The sixth formers were given a chance to see many aspects of student
life. Professor B u t t e r w o r t h , H e a d of D e p a r t m e n t , gave a short
welcoming speech, which was followed by a talk on studying physics at
IC by the departmental rep, M a r k Gillett. T o give a general view of
student union activities, I C U H o n Sec, L i z Lindsay, also gave a
speech.
The most interesting part of the visit was probably the tour of first
year laboratory projects. These are prepared every year in the
department as part of the first year lab course and are normally
displayed to students and stall' of the College. The display was
extended to a second day to allow the sixth formers to witness the wide
variety oi topics covered. These ranged from studies of microprocessor
and laser applications to biophysics, and even included a fascinating
reconstruction of "Practical Physics" in the nineteenth century. There
were some fifty projects in all.
T o give a wider view of undergraduate life a short lecture on
astronomy was also included in the programme.
The open day was considered a great success by stall and students
alike and is likely to be repeated nexl year.

hence the name. Most teams are
made up of service cadets, police

to show late in the first afternoon

slowing the pace.
Despite every effort, the team

Don't say you weren't warned, I'm
talking now to you who are the
president/chairman, etc of any of
the above groups, who couldn't be
bothered, either through total lack
of competence, literary talent or
just plain bloody laziness, to have
submitted even a blank sheet of
paper to me for this year's Hand-
book. You are the dregs of the
Union. I shall have great pleasure in
writing some of the articles e.g. Rag,
Iranian Soc, etc, and especially (as I
am a Guildsman) the R S M and R C S
articles. (Steve has told me he has
some great photos that he hasn't
dared to print this year and I am
eager to get my hands on them.)
If you haven't got the message so
far, then don't bother writing your
article because I won't accept it.
