Dear Sir
T h a n k y o u very m u c h for
p u b l i s h i n g " C N D — A ( ' t i m -
m e n t " by Frank James in lasl
week s F ' E L I X . H e expressed
what is my considered opinion on
C N D . thai supporters are "mis-
guided idealists", etc.. in a very
excellent logical argument.
I do regret that we actually
n e e d I o s p e n d so m u c h o n
defence, but I don't think il can
be avoided. Russia apart.imagine
if some other extremist govern-
ment derided lliai they wished to
impose their views on the rest of
us. if they managed to develop
their own nuclear weapons and
knew thai the rest ol the world
had disarmed. I believe that even
this is a small lineal compared lo
the lineal from Russia.
I have talked lo many oilier
students and stall al I C who are
also opposed lo C X I ) , and il
a p p e a r s l o me that a l a r g e
proportion of IC is opposed to
C N D — p o s s i b l y a majority.'
W e have heard so much about
tin- C N D point ol view icee-iilly.
I'm glad the opposing point ol
view ioiuid lis way into F K I . I X

Dear Sir
W i t h r e g a r d to last week's
a r t i c l e b y F r a n k J a m e s i n
F ' E L I X . commenting on C X D .
F i r s t o f a l l , he c o n s i d e r s
members ol C X D to be -•genuine-
idealists, but . . misguided,
because they have not considered
all the lac I s . " How can he make,
this generalisation:' (The only
facts he himself considers are
those s u p p o r t i n g his point ol
view). There is a tendency lo
admire realists for their cool-
headed approach, but when his
idea of 'realism" is an escalating
arms race, far beyond any need
for d e t e r r e n c e , w i t h e n o u g h
nuclear weapons to kill everybody
on both sides several times over,
then something is wrong.
" A nuclear war would be an
evil thing . . . which every person
s h o u l d w o r k to a v o i d . " W e l l
w h a t a r e n u c l e a r w e a p o n s
protagonists doing lo avoid a
nuclear holocaust? There have
l>een multilateral disarmament
talks lor many years now, but the
total number ol nuclear weapons
has been growing all the time-. By
increasing the number ol missiles
in this country, and improving
our own nuclear capability, do
we make nuclear war less likely,
or its effects less terrible?
"Better red lhan d»-ad" is not
particularly a C N D slogan, true
though it is.
" C N D thinks that the threat te>
our security comes from Russia
lather lhan America. Where
does F r a n k J a m e s t h i n k the
l i n e a l is c o m i n g from? ( T h e
answer lies in his fourth para-
graph: "we in Europe must be
p r e p a r e d to r e s i s t R u s s i a n
a g g r e s s i o n . ") W h y s h o u l d
America threaten to occupy us.
and if they d i d , what chance
w o u l d we s t a n d o n o u r o w n
when most of Britain's nuclear
w e a p o n s a r e c o n t r o l l e d by
N A T O (which is controlled by
America)? A n y w a y , it is precisely
the idi-a of the so-called Russian
threat", and the division ol the
world into East bad. Wesi good
thai we dispute.
' F i l e o n l y t h i n g that they
u n d e r s t a n d is p o w e r ( w i t h
leleienee to the Russian system)
is a Russian human being all thai
different from an A m e r i c a n one.
or are- I hey some soil ol animal
devoid of human feeling.' " 1 lie-
Russians would nol have- any

n u c l e a r w e a p o n s . " B u i the
Russians have- tried lo initiate
el isa r m a m e n I ne go I ia I ions at
leasi as much as America lias.
Ibis is line, if you consider all
I he- lac is.
However, apart from all these
disagreements, my major objec-
tion lo Frank Janus support ol
inn lear deterrence is thai tile
w h o l e icle-a is out ol d a t e .
Nowadays, with Cruise missiles
accurate- lo within 100 metres.
America reckons on F I G H T I N G
a nuclear war in Europe. 1 don t
deny thai Russia and Britain arc
prepared or preparing lor this,
but lliat only makes il worse. The
whole thing getting absurdly out

something positive was clone to

Dear Sir
O n Friday I was interested to
look round the first year Physics
projects, sejme of w h i c h were
involved with the experimental
reactor. Fascinating though these
e x p e r i m e n t s are, the n u c l e a r
power programme raises more
questions than are answered in
the undergraduate physics ease.
Tlie 197(i Royal Commission
o n N u c l e a r P o w e r a n d t h e
Envionmcnt' (chaired by our own
Sir Brian Flowers) recommended
that there be no large seale
expansion ol nuclear power until
the problem ol radioactive waste
disposal had be-en solved.
It has nol. although there are
h o p e f u l d e v e l o p m e n t s in the
synthetic rock substitute in which
to incorporate the waste. H o w -
ever, the time-scale over which
high level radioactive waste must
be isolated and lack of monitoring
experience phis the irreversible
e o n s e q n e n e e s — t h e w a s t e is
ultimately intended to be non-
ictrievable—make this part of
t h e n u c l e a r c y c l e a s e r i o u s
gamble.
Proliferation ol nuclear weapon
slates as a byproduct of civil
programmes is unavoidable: the
N o n - P r o l i f e r a t i o n T r e a t y has
been ineffective in preventing
this. South Africa is probably the
late-si country to develop nuclear
w e a p o n s , this b e i n g its a c k -
nowledged intention: it certainly
now has its own reprocessing
facilities. Imperial College may
have mades its own contribution
to this disturbing development
by r u n n i n g a nuclear technology
ionise with students sponsored
by the S African government.
I he e c o n o m i e s ol n u c l e a r
power do not take into account
the unknown costs of decom-
missioning and waste disposal.
the fact that most research and
d e v e l o p m e n t has been clone
under military- budgets (admit-
tedly ibis could be regarded as a
spin-off), nor ibe g o v e r n m e n t
subsidy in taking over most ol the
i n s u r a n c e p r o v i s i o n l o r the
nuclear industry. (This insurance
provision, a m a x i m u m ol r
5()m,
is pitifully inadequate.)
Britain's nuclear programme
in particular is in serious trouble;
the early M a g n o x reactor's uselul
life is coming to an end. whilst
the A G R p r o g r a m m e w h i c h
superceded the M a g n o x program
has b e e n d e s c r i b e d the e x -
C h a i r m a n of the C E G B as " a
disaster we must not repeat".
Dungeness A G R has slill not
been completed, over ten years
behind schedule, whilst Hinkley
P o i n t a n d H i i n k e s i e n h a v e
siilfered serious accidents—the
latter occurred when sea water
was let into the reactpr in an
o p e r a t i o n c o n t r a v e n i n g safety
procedures, and cost /.10m (plus
X'40m lost electricity) to repair.
T h e a l t e r n a t i v e s now are lo
continue with ibis program or lo
develop an imported design such
as the A m e r i c a n P r e s s u r i z e d
Water Reactor (one of which will
be built al Sizewelli.
T h e recent Commons Select
Committee on Energy censured
I he C E G B for having no coherent
plan and disregarding downward
trends in energy growth al a time-
when il and the S S E B (which is
s t i l l g o i n g a h e a d w i t h the
construction of Towness nuclear
p o w e r station at a cost now
approaching jT2billi6n) already
h a v e h i g h g e n e r a t i n g o v e r -
capacity.
The Department of Energy has
still hot provided figures on the
relative benefits ol an energy
conservation programme versus a
power plant building program,
and ibe government has cut back
its energy c o n s e r v a t i o n p r o -
gramme, is attempting to run
down the coal industry (which
will have to expand as oil prices
rise), a n d p r o v i d e s l u k e w a r m
support for research into new
coal c o m b u s t i o n technologies,
renewable energy sources, and
e n e r g y c o n s e r v a t i o n s u c h as
c o m b i n e d h e a t a n d p o w e r
schemes.
T h e government is trying to
defuse the environmental aspects
as the n u c l e a r p o w e r debate
whilst the industry is currently
increasing the already consider-
able sums of money dec reed to
providing its simplistic (il not
actually misleading propaganda,
especially in schools (and pre-
sumably universities .
T h e failure to adopt a more
r e a l i s t i c a n d less r e s t r i c t i v e
energy polity will be disastrous.
