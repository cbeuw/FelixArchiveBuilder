Letters to
the Editor
Dear Sieve
I must confess that I was most
surprised at the mildness of your
attack on Meet I C '81 in last
week's F E L I X . However may I
congratulate you on the manner
with which you captured the
salts tany of Capt Lindley "s ( R X
Retd) remarks.
In my opinion, as an assistant
at one of the exhibits. I thought
that the event was a complete
Hop. In order lo understand how
a n d w h y t h i s u t t e r f a i l u r e
occurred the following questions
should be asked oft he appropriate
College authorities.
1. D o e s a n y one s e r i o u s l y
t h i n k that s u c h a n o b v i o u s
propaganda exercise will exert
the least inlluencconorganisations
s u c h as t h e K n i g h t s b r i d g c
associaiton w h e n It comes to
future College planning applica-
tions.'
2. H o w many local residents
attended the event?
.'5. How many letter of thanks
were received afterwards?
4. C a n anyone provide a full
analysis ol the cost ol the event?
i.e. what was the cost for the
flowers, the posters, handouts,
food and (not very good) wine,
the overtime of the stall kept on
late. A n d last, but by no means
least, an estimate of the cost ol
the time put into the event by
members of the academic and
non-academic stall and research
students, II these figures cannot
be provided, why not?
5. W h a t w a s t h e cost o f
specially importing cleaners to
( l e a n the stairs i n the m a i n
Sherfield Building?
6. W h a t w a s t h e cost o f
printing the invitations?
7. H o w m a n y outside cars
arrived for the event for which a
t r a f f i c w a r d e n was s p e c i a l l y
provided?
8. At which entrance to the
C o l l e g e w a s M a r k C a r l i s l e
supposed to arrive and which
entrance did he actually arrive?
9. How long did M a r k (Carlisle
have to wait while people looked
for his car?
10. Does anyone think that
M a r k Carlisle was siilficiently
impressed with the efficiency of
the event to make him change his
mind on College cuts.'
11. H o w m a n y i n v i t a t i o n s
were sent out?
12. How m a m acceptances
were received?
13. D i d the answer lo question
12 suggest to anybody that the
event should be cancelled?
1 4. W h o d e c i d e d t h a i i lie
event should begin at ():()()?
15. W h o decided that no lood
or drinks should be served until
an hour and three quarters alter
the event began?
Hi. Was it thought that the
exhibits were of such stunning
interest that people would be
m e s m e r i s e d for 105 m i n u t e s
without nourishment?
17. Whose responsibility will
it be to decide whether or not
there will be another event of this
character in the future?
) mm sincerely
The Sherfield M o l e
PS: I happen to know the ans-
wers to some of the questions.
Dear Sir
In pursuit of the matter raised
in last week's letters page by M r
A Ri/.vi, I would like to inlbrm
any interested readers thai as a
Beit H a l l (mixed. 40% women)
resident, I recently found, slipped
under my room door, a question-
naire addressed to "Residents of
M i x e d H a l l s " intended for the
guidance of the Student Resi-
dence Committee.
Assuming that this question-
naire is not three months late
being circulated, the S R C are to
be commended for the promptness
of their response to the outcry
about the decision taken on bow
Halls should be mixed. However,
there are a lew things about il
which I would like to point out.
O n e is first asked ones sex and
one's H a l l of Residence, then,
and I quote " B e a r i n g in mind the
composition of I C " to rate the
proportion of females in ones
residence on a scale from " m u c h
too h i g h " to " m u c h too l o w " ,
and finally, in one's own opinion
(and "Please inform us il anyone
tries to influence your response"
— is t h e r e a m a f i a a r o u n d
College I hadn't heard ol?) to say
whether the present ratio is ideal,
or very unacceptable, or some-
where in between.
Well, surely one's answer to
the last q u e s t i o n is a d i r e c t
consequence ol his answer to the
question above it. and is as such
redundant, and. more important-
ly, ones answer to the above.
most significant, question, given
the phrase " B e a r i n g in... ol IC
quoted above, ceases lo I)*' one ol
personal opinion but one based,
on the contrary, purely on fact
rendering ibis question redun-
dant also.
So. this leaves one to answer
I lie first two questions, and I
t h i n k I hat I he S R C ' s i n i t i a l
request lor only one response to
each is most unfair to those ol us
who may be unsure of their sex or
who may perchance inhabit lour
residences simultaneously.
I would therefore, sir. like to
complain.

Dear Sir
W e are writing to you because,
lor the second week running it
has been discovered (hat deci-
sions c o n c e r n i n g student hall
accommodation for next year
h a v e been t a k e n by C o l l e g e
a u t h o r i t i e s a n d I C U w i t h o u t
p r i o r c o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h those
most d i r e c t l y i n v o l v e d — the
students a n d those c o n c e r n e d
with running t he halls in question.
Apparently it has been decided
to merge S e l k i r k / T i z a r d a n d
K c o g h Falmouth following the
early retirement of the Keogh
Warden and subsequent non-
renewal of contract olfered to
Selkirk Warden. T h e Warden of
T i z a r d will now be responsible
for Selkirk, and the W a r d e n of
Falmouth will be responsible for
Keogh.
While we in no way question
the a b i l i t y of t h e W a r d e n s
c o n c e r n e d , we w o u l d like to
make the point that in view ol the
special situation ol small halls like
Selkirk, we feel that they require
the l u l l a t t e n t i o n of just one
warden. In the past Selkirk has
been particularly successful in
p r o v i d i n g a s u p p o r t i v e a n d
stimulating environment for the
students allocated to it. Its size
has meant that the warden and
subwarden have been able to
g i v e t h e i r l u l l p e r s o n a l i s e d
attention to those who need it.
directly assisted by the overall
c o n d u c i v e social e n v i r o n m e n t
engendered by the warden's close
involvement with a small hall.
There is a need for such small
balls in c o m p l e x C o l l e g e e n -
v i r o n m e n t w i t h its m a n y d e -
mands and pressures placed on
s t u d e n t s w i t h v a r i e d h a r d
students w i t h v a r i e d p e r s o n a l
needs and response. N o matter
how well intentioned or hard
w o r k i n g the n e w o v e r s e e i n g
warden is. lie will now have bis
attention split between two halls.
This individual attention will be
sacrificed for the sake of the tent
gained on the old warden's fiat.
W h i c h is w o r t h m o r e : t h e
wellbcing of students catered Ibr
by lhe special, personalised social
environment of these halls, or a
lew thousand pounds a year in
rent?
Even il such arguments are
ignored, surely such a merger
w o u l d belter be tried out in
K c o g h alone (whose takeover
was intended on retirement of the
warden anyway), rather than
s i m u l t a n e o u s l y n o w o n i h e
recommendation of I C U . D i d
they ask us?
Like the situation complained
about in last week's F E L I X by
the subwarden ol Beit, this is yet
another example of the failure of
the a u t h o r i t i e s responsible to
consult the opinions of the people
i n v o l v e d , w h o may h a v e a
perfectly valid input to make.
T h i s f a i l u r e is p a r t i c u l a r l y
reprehensible on the part ol I C U
(who supported the merger) since
it is they who are supposed to
represent the student interest and
have, as on previous occasions,
singularly failed to do so.

Dear Sir
I a m writing this letter con-
cerning the recent political crisis
in Northern Ireland, and the
attitude adopted by the British
press, p a r t i c u l a r l y The Tunes
towards the situation there.
In an article on the recent
funeral of the hunger-striker M r
Bobby Sands. M r Christopher
Thomas of The Times stated on
May 8, 1981: " T h e 2,000 victims
of his collaborators will never bi-
as famous."
The only logical conclusion
one can draw from this is that M r
Thomas is totally unaware of the
fact that Loyalist paramilitaries
are responsible lor almost half of
the civilian deaths in X Ireland,
not to mention those innocent
people shot by the British A r m y .
1'he other possible interpre-
tation of this statement is that M i -
Thomas thinks that the I R A . the
British A r m y , the I ' D A . U Y F ,
etc are collaborators!
X o one is denying I hat the
I R A lias been responsible for a
lot of deaths in X Ireland but M r
T h o m a s a n d f e l l o w B r i t i s h
journalists seem to have lost all
sense ol perspective, if not truth.
The fundamental reasons for
the d i s t u r b a n c e s in N o r t h e r n
Ireland have once again been
conveniently forgotten by the
B r i t i s h G o v e r n m e n t , a n d the
B r i t i s h p r e s s . T h e r o o t s o f
violence in X Ireland can be
traced directly to British policy
which succeeded in establishing
the q u a s i - f a s c i s t state of X
Ireland where one party rule
existed for fifty years, against the
wishes of the majority of the
