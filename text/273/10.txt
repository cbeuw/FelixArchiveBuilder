1. Much c f the organised entertainment i s useful and should be kept.
Sub-sections of I . C . Ents could deal with formal b a l l s , c a r n i v a l s and
informal dances.
R i v a l r y does not have to be i n i t i a t e d by Constituent C o l l e g e s .
Most U n i v e r s i t i e s have groups which engage i n f r i e n d l y r i v a l r y and i f
there were no Constituent Colleges r i v a l r y would s t i l l be seen, probably
through h a l l s of residence and departments.
2. The sporting clubs mostly e x i s t only for the int<,r-college trophies
i n each s p o r t . The more important sports e . g . Rugby, have t h e i r own teams
but I see no reason why I . C . cannot arrange matches as for soccer.
Academic clubs are u s u a l l y departmentally based and there i s no
reason why they cannot carry on as they are.
3. Academic A f f a i r s at the moment are dealt with mostly by the constituent
c o l l e g e s . There are staff-student committees i n each department and each
constituent c o l l e g e has an academic o f f i c e r (rep) who co-ordinates a c t i v i t i e s
for the constituent c o l l e g e s . As one who has been p a r t i c u l a r l y involved
i n t h i s aspect of union a c t i v i t y , I have thought hard about t h i s subject.
The J o i n t Rector Governing Body and Student d i s c u s s i o n body, JURGO, concerns
i t s e l f to a considerable extent with academic a f f a i r s . Having worked i n both
R . C . S . and I . C . , on academic a f f a i r s I f e e l that i t i s at an I . C . , not
constituent c o l l e g e l e v e l that we need academic a f f a i r s e x p e r t i s e , the
constituent c o l l e g e intermediate l e v e l being merely an encumbrance.
One reason f o r the existance of constituent c o l l e g e s i s h i s t o r i c a l .
I . C . and I . C . U . has always been subsectioned i n t h i s way. But, i n the l a s t
few years students have been much more involved i n dooisiori making than
p r e v i o u s l y and have, therefore, had to change t h e i r t h i n k i n g a c c o r d i n g l y .
For example, Student Welfare and academic a f f a i r s have become very important
and deserve? to have f i r s t c l a s s people running them.
For the important job of running I . C . U , we deserve much more co-
ordinated a c t i o n than the constituent c o l l e g e s a l l o w . I . C . must be sub-
sectioned, but the sub-sections do not. have to be autonomous. Remember,
when you vote that i f you vote f o r constituent colleges you are voting
for 3 autonomous unions. I submit that taese constituent c o l l e g e s weaken
Imperial College Union.
The Case f o r the Existence of ICWA
Imperial College Women's A s s o c i a t i o n , or ICWA as i t i s commonly c a l l e d ,
f u l f i l s several important f u n c t i o n s . I t i s encouraging more women to come
here by arranging for g i r l s to go back to t h e i r schools to t a l k about I . C .
and by meeting female interviewees, so that they can ask questions about the
c o l l e g e and so that we can attempt to encourage them to come here. ICWA
organises fresher arrangements from the f i r s t week of term, which range from
meeting freshers at the Royal Geographical S o c i e t y , to e n t e r t a i n i n g them to
coffee throughout the week, i f they want to come. Besides t h i s , ICWA
organises various s o c i a l functions throughout the year, and acts as an
o f f i c i a l body through which contact can be made. It also ensures that the
women have a voice on c o u n c i l , which they e l e c t themselves and who they
probably a l l know.
Whether you b e l i e v e that ICWA should e x i s t or not depends on whether
you t h i n k that i t s a c t i v i t i e s are d e s i r a b l e or not. One of them main
arguments against ICWA i s i t s 'per capita* grant. This argument can also
be used against the Constituent College Unions and I . C . U . i t s e l f because
although i t i s 'compulsory' to be a member, i t i s always v o l u n t a r i l y that
one takes p a r t .
At t h i s time some women are beginning to make t h e i r own way i n t h i s
c o l l e g e and I welcome t h i s as i t i s a sign that ICWA i s achieving i t s end
for ICWA i s t r y i n g to increase i t s numbers s u f f i c i e n t l y so that i t does not
need to e x i s t ; u n t i l then I would urge you to support the existence of ICWA.
