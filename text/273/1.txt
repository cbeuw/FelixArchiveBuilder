Following the Emergency Guilds meeting (reported in the last Felix) disapproving of the
actions of a " militant minority" of LSE students, the next week was dominated by a
reaction against the Guilds vote. On this page is reported the motion proposed at last
Thursday week's ICU meeting in support of the student position. On the back page a
similar motion at RCSU. On page 4 prolific correspondence on the issue.
D.E.S. grants reply
A letter (from the Depart-
ment of Education and
Science) was received last
week by the External Affairs
Officer, Dave Wield, reply-
ing to the petition on grants
sent to Mr. Short from IC
(for details—see Page 3).
The letter reads, " The
Secretary of State has noted
the terms of the motion
passed at a recent meeting of
your College Union. While
he is sorry that it was not
possible to give full effect to
the recommendations made
by the Advisory Panel on
Student Maintenance Grants,
it was unavoidable in the
present economic circum-
stances. At a time when re-
ductions have had to be
The Extraordinary Meet-
ing of ICU was greeted not
only by a superquorum but
also by one or two non-ICU
members, presumably there
to hear the inevitable motion
on LSE.
Firstly, however, there was
George Assimakis' motion
proposing a referendum to
find the opinions of students
on several possible changes
to the constitution, including
changes of status of the con-
stituent college unions and
ICWA, and whether or not
IC should join the NUS.
In his proposal speech he
stressed that a rejection of
college unions and ICWA as
a result of the referendum
would not automatically lead
to their abolition; possibly
only a reduction in their
powers. It would take a long
time and a lot of work to
change the constitution, he
claimed, so it would be best
to make sure that any
changes would be as a result
of a referendum, and thus the
wish of the student body. The
motion was amended to in-
clude a meeting to discuss
the subject before the refer-
endum would be held.
Dermott Corr's basis for
argument as opposer of the
motion was that the working
party set up to discuss con-
stitutional change had not
yet progressed far enough to
make a referendum at the
present time anything more
than a waste of time, energy
and money, and the seconder
of the motion said little
except that the Union could
be no worse, so any change
would be for the better. John
Perrins referred to the "yes-
no" nature of the answers
required by the referendum
as being far too restricting for
questions which could result
in fundamental changes to
the constitution; apart from
this he thought that the mass
of IC students were too ill-
informed for the results of
the referendum to be mean-
ingful. The President inter-
vened to tell the meeting that
the arguments brought up
by the proposers of changes
would be printed in FELIX,
which reached the majority
of IC students. (In fact, a
duplicated sheet should be
found inside.)
The motion was finally
carried by 181-144, and the
dates of the discussion meet-
ing and the referendum set-
tled for Feb. 20th and 24th
respectively. George Assi-
makis, Chris Parker, Chris
Kent, David Foster, and John
Perrins were appointed as
members of the working
party for the referendum.
L.S.E.
The second motion was
proposed by Piers Corbyn,
and was that ICU believes
that the problems of LSE
should be resolved by the
students of LSE alone, and
that the school should only
be re-opened under the con-
ditions decided upon at the
last meeting of 1500 stu-
dents. Despite an unsuccess-
ful attempt to move next
business by Mr. Olley and
Mr. Mackman, Mr. Corbyn
made an informative speech
about the school, putting the
blame for its troubles on Dr.
Adams and his action in put-
ting up gates without any
consultation with staff or any
warning to students, also in
his supposed victimisation of
staff sympathetic with stu-
dents. He cited two examples
of staff at LSE acting as in-
formers to the police, and
accused Dr. Adams of
believing in double punish-
ment.
C. C. Parker began by
speaking against the motion
but later proposed an amend-
ment to the motion, that the
resolution to the problems of
LSE should be based on
tolerance. Tolerance did not
mean apathy, he said, and
spoke of "agitating groups"
in LSE, reading some of their
literature to the meeting. Mr.
Corbyn questioned the con-
stitutional right of Mr.
Parker to attempt to change
the motion in such a drastic
way in the middle of an
opposition speech, but Rex
Lewin decided it was permis-
sible, and called for a vote as
to whether the amendment
could be accepted. After
Jeff Steer had caused utter
confusion by accidentally
phrasing the motion in two
contradictory ways, and the
result of the vote misread, the
amendment was defeated.
The seconder of the motion
pointed out that the students
at LSE were back to the same
position as they were in the
days of Adelstein and Bloom,
although he agreed that the
students had taken direct
action against the gates in
the wrong way. A move to a
vote was carried, but 20
people present decided they
wanted a ballot vote, which
met with disapproval from
the majority, but the stand-
ing orders upheld their right
to do this. The problem was
neatly sidestepped by sus-
pending the standing orders
whilst a vote was held. The
motion was carried 190-159,
and the orders reinstated.
Les Ebdon making a point at the I.C.U. meeting.
Challenge
Les Ebdon stood to pro-
pose the motion that ICU
refuses to accept "double
punishment" for students
under any circumstances, and
mandates Council to open
negotiations with the Rector
and bring the matter before
the Board of Governors
before the end of term.
Before Ebdon could speak,
the traditional challenge to
the quorum was made—the
time being 2.30 — but
astoundingly the number of
people still present was 304.
Rob Collinge opposed the
motion on the practical
grounds that the Board of
Governors did not meet
before the end of Term.
Bbdon then amended the
motion to overcome this
objection — for "Term,"
read " session " — and after
his summing-up speech in
which he disassociated him-
self from the militant opin-
ions of his seconder, the
motion was carried on a
show of hands,
made over a wide range of
educational and social ex-
penditure it was not possible
to justify the treatment of
students as a special case.
"Despite this decision
there has been no falling off
in the quest for university
places. The student grant
system in this country re-
mains a generous one com-
pared with the systems
adopted in other countries
and we believe it unlikely
that students will or have
suffered any serious hardship
solely as a consequence of
the decision."
The London Regional Or-
ganization of NUS are taking
action on grants as well as
IC, and the timing of the
petition happily coincided
with the start of their grants
campaign.
Philip
for R.G.S.
dinner
This year the Guest of
Honour at the Annual Royal
College of Science Dinner
will be H.R.H., the Duke of
Edinburgh. The Dinner is to
be held in Southside on 14th
May.
A top-class Mooney is
guaranteed and with the
Union subsidy the Dinner will
cost 30/- per person. Out of
300 places, 100 are allocated
to guests and the reception
committee and the remaining
200 will be for sale. Tickets
are by application form
only, either from the RCS
Broadsheet or from forms
to be distributed throughout
the Union. However it is
rumoured that the Dinner is
already oversubscribed and
people applying for tickets
now would be very lucky to
get one.
Culture at Guilds
The Guild's Union meet-
ing on Tuesday 11th Feb.
concerned itself almost totally
with its Festival of Music
and Culture. Chem. Eng.l
won it with a skit containing
a budding young female im-
personator.
In the aftermath of their
controversial motion passed
a week or so before, Guilds
seem the least concerned of
all about it. No mention of
it was made, except, perhaps,
for a few cries for P. Mar-
shall himself to perform
something. As he was one of
the judges of the Festival, his
refusal to do so can only be
deemed obvious.
