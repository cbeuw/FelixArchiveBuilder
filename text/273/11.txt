The Case against the Existence ofiCWA
In a l l recent d i s c u s s i o n concerning ICWA, no-one appears to have
explained why i t e x i s t s i n the f i r s t p l a c e . As I understand i t , ICWA
e x i s t s to provide female representation i n the Union and to protect the
f i r s t year g i r i s from the l e e r i n g males of t h i s c o l l e g e . This may have
b«_en necessary i n the days when there were only a doj en or so Icwarians,
but today the s i t u a t i o n i s t o t a l l y d i f f e r e n t ,
Excluding the ICWA P r e s i d e n t , there are three women en t h i s y e a r ' s
C o u n c i l , thus clear}y making the 'female representation' angle t o t a l l y
i r r e l e v a n t . I sumpathiso with those g i r l s wh> f i n d i t d i f f i c u l t to adjust
to u n i v e r s i t y l i f e , and would l i k e to see some form of s o c i a l club to help
them. But I cannot see why t h i s necessitates a grant of £350 a year from
the Union.
What does ICWA do with t h i s money? I t i s spent on ICWA sport, the
ICWA Formal and numerous sherry p a r t i e s for ICWArians. In t h i s way ICWA
has e f f e c t i v e l y set i t s e l f up as a fourth constituent c o l l e g e . Is t h i s
necessary? I should say no. ICWA sport could be handled quite adequately
by ACC and a s p e c i a l , a p p l i c a t i o n for a grant could be cade for the ICWA
Formal<,
• It would be grossly u n f a i r for ECU to merely disband ICWA. I f the
women of I . C . want t h e i r own .society then they should be allowed-to have
one, ' : v\ ,
I do not b e l i e v e , however, that ICWA deserves i t s present s t a t u s .
The only d i r e c t action that ICU should take i.j to transfer ICWA to SCC,
where i t would receive a gr ;nt appropriate to i t s needs.
I t i s , perhaps, worth noting that only about kCF/i of Icwarians play
any par-'; i n ICWA. The need for reform i s c l e a r l y .imminentthough t h i s
must come from within ICWA.
I would o c c l u d e by saying that i n i t s present form ICWA i s an
expensive anachrcr-i Hra, i t i s time the system was changed.
Executive - For and Against
The duties of the Executive a:; l a i d dow*. i n the C o n s t i t u t i o n , are
to deal w i t h matters of urgency and the day to day running of the Union,
The Executive c o n s i s t s of the President, Deputy P r e s i d e n t , Secretary
and three Constituent College P r e s i d e n t s , and meets -e a week during
term time.
The day to day running of the Union e » g . furnishings and the booking
of rooms can now be dealt with by the newly formed house cormittee. In
p r a c t i s e the Executive deal With urgent matters and anything concerning
the Constituent College Unions and u s u a l l y has very l i t t l e do do. Since
Council i s now meeting approximately once a f o r t n i g h t , instead of twice
a term as p r e v i o u s l y , the number of urgent matters has dropped correspond-
i n g l y .
The argument against the existence of the Executive i s that there
now e x i s t s very l i t t l e for i t to do. I t i s very d i f f i c u l t for such a
group of people to meet r e g u l a r l y and do nothing and so the temptation
w i l l always e x i s t to bring up matters which should properly be dealt with
by Council or a union meeting. Hatters concerning the Constituent Colleges
could e a s i l y be dealt with elsewhere.
Against t h i s , some other body would have to be c a l l e d (rather than
meet r e g u l a r l y ) , to deal with any genuine matters of urgency. Whilst
t h i s could be done f a i r l y e a s i l y , i t i s c e r t a i n l y not as convenient as
having regular meeting;.!.
The choice i s between a s l i g h t i i crease of inconvenienre,and a
p o s s i b l e increase of more democratic d e c i s i o n s -
