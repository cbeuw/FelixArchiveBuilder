"A sustained enquiryjnto the roots of our present possibilities and disc
Among several h i g h -
sounding words and phrases
which have come into use
and misuse during the past
decade, the "underground"
and the "avant-garde" seem
to have come to stay. Most
people have some idea as to
the general concept of the
underground movement in
the arts, but to many the
avant garde is just a vague
phrase connected with mod-
ern art.
The Institute of Contem-
porary Arts (ICA) describes
the avant-garde as a name
given to artists working in
and exploring the spaces
between the general classifi-
cations of Art — Painting,
Sculpture, Music, etc., and
the gaps between artist and
audience. The ICA is at the
centre of the avant-garde
movement in England, the
largest arts centre in Lon-
don and one of the biggest
in Britain.
The idea of such a centre
was first formed in 1936 at
the time of the first Inter-
national Surrealist Exhibi-
tion, but progress was
delayed by the war and the
ICA was not founded offi-
cially untl 1947, in the base-
ment of the Academy
cinema in Oxford St. In the
following year it moved to
more permanent premises in
Dover St., off Piccadilly,
where it remained until just
two years ago. The founding
group included Sir Herbert
Read, who saw the ICA as
a group experimenting with
and promoting education
through art in Britain, and
Sir Roland Penrose, who saw
it more as a link between
creative activity in Britain
and on the Continent.
Besides producing the
first London exhibitions of
work by several leading
foreign artists, including
Cartier-bresson and Dubuf-
fet, the ICA was instrumen-
tal in laying the foundations
of what is now known as
Pop Art.
Now the ICA is the major
member of five separate
societies occupying Nash
House in the Mall and has
come under the directorship
of Michael Kustow, former-
ly of the Royal Shakespeare
Company. Kustow believes
that the experimental art
being produced today should
not all have its origins in
the underground; that main-
stream institutions like the
ICA can also provide top-
grade non-traditional work.
He sees the aim of the ICA
to be to provide " a free
space in which the deepest
questions of the age which
concern us as individuals
and as a society can be ex-
plored in continuity, not just
as a series of colour sup-
plements or television dis-
cussions but as a sustained
enquiry into the roots of our
present possibilities and dis-
contents."
The new premises house
facilities for all the arts,
including a modern cinema,
a theatre for 250 people, an
art gallery, a restaurant and
a bar. The gallery provides
an outlet for the works of
visual artists wishing to ex-
periment outside the restric-
ting influence of the com-
mercial galleries, and a
similar function is preformed
by the ICA cinema.
O u t l e t
The theatre caters for
playwrights trying to break
away from traditional thea-
trical form. The conditions
of the commercial theatre
preclude the permanent
companies and long rehear-
sal periods the most com-
mitted actors and directors
need, and although the
subsidised theatres do not
have to be concerned with
" box-office" to such an
extent, they are still com-
mitted to public work which
prevents their producing
much experimental work.
The ICA provides a non-
commercial outlet for direc-
tors and writers working in
this experimental branch of
the theatre.
The magazine Mix, which
the ICA produces, provides
space for writers trying new
forms of expression, and
their work can also be re-
viewed at readings and
seminars held within the
building.
Perhaps the most impor-
tant area of the arts, how-
ever, is that pertaining to
modern education, for there
is a feeling that traditional
education is lacking in some
essential moral and imagin-
ative content which could
give it coherence, a role
once played by religion, but
no longer so. The ICA is a
centre where the work of
the professional artist and
educationalist can be co-
ordinated to fill this gap.
In brief, then, the Insti-
tute exists to break down
the barriers between artist
and audience and replace
the few discerning patrons
of the arts with a more or
less mass public, and to pro-
vide the avant-garde with
the physical recognition and
facilities that the RSC
affords the theatre and
opera.
To use another word
which has taken on a new
meaning in the past few
years, the ICA is the centre
of a new scene, a counter-
scene to the underground, a
meeting place for the artist
and audience which that
loose nucleus of ideas and
systems cannot supply.

"A Bitter
Financial
Winter . . .
Despite a huge success in
building up its membership
to 10,000 in nine months
(this was originally the tar-
get for twelve months), the
ICA faces what Michael
Kustow describes as " a bit-
ter financial winter ". This
position has arisen because
of the failure of the Arts
Council to meet ICA's esti-
mation of a reasonable
grant. When the ICA moved
to Nash House, they pre-
sented a set of estimates to
the Arts Council for the cost
of the new operation. This
they claimed would be
£75,000 per year, which they
considered reasonable in
comparison with the £90,000
subsidy received by the
Royal Court Theatre. The
Arts Council allowed them
only £25,000. which merely
covered the rent and servi-
ces.
The ICA thus started a
mass recruiting drive, which
has proved to be an out-
standing success. Admissions
and membership fees to-
gether brought in £46,000,
which still leaves a deficit of
£34,000. The cost of mount-
ing, preparing and advertis-
ing their programme is cited
by Kustow as the main rea-
son for the large deficit, and
the lack of foresight in not
comparing these costs with
the expected income.
The first year was rather
special, however, as costs for
such expenditures as equip-
ing the gallery, creating the
membership campaign, and
paying for the introductory
publicity will not have to be
met in the future. The ICA
is still nevertheless left with
the job of repaying the defi-
cit, and to this end they
have brought a few econo-
mies into force, for example
the Magazine has been sus-
pended.
They are also appealing
for help from their friends,
both industrial concerns and
private individual, to help
them through their present
financial difficulties.
The demand for a centre
such as the ICA has been
shown in the large member-
ship they have built up over
a short period of just one
year. Everyone who has visi-
ted any of their functions
will realise that in the range
and quality of its produc-
tions, the ICA is unique as
a non-Underground organi-
sation catering for the tastes
of the younger generation,
and I for one would hate
to see it dissolve because of
the financial problems it has
met in getting off the
ground.
