About a month ago the
second Student House was
opened, bringing the num-
ber of students accommoda-
ted to 180. After their
initial teething troubles, and
the rumours that have been
circulating, it's time for
some facts to be provided.
The idea of buying up
existing houses to provide
accommodation s t a r t e d
some years ago, with the old
Selkirk Hall which was at
50, Holland Park. This was
followed by the building of
Southside and Weeks, after
which the old Selkirk Hall
was sold. However, as the
money for providing accom-
modation in Halls of Resi-
dence dwindled, interest in
houses was rearoused. The
original feasibility study was
done by Council and was
based on information gath-
ered from Hull University,
which has a system of Stu-
dent Houses. Although the
capital outlay was higher in
London than in Hull a sig-
nificant saving was evident
in respect to building Halls
of Residence. The ideas
were put into practice in
1967/68 and some houses
were acquired at Evelyn
Gardens, S.W.7. The finance
for conversion of the first
eight houses into two Stu-
dent Houses was obtained,
the first being opened in
October 1968 and the second
in January 1969; by Octo-
ber 1969 it is hoped to have
a further three Houses, tak-
ing 360 students in all.
In contrast to the Halls of
Residence, the Houses have
to be self-supporting and
cannot rely as heavily on
College services, or the
income from Conferences to
subsidise costs. However, by
reducing the amount of
cleaning provided it has
been possible to keep rents
low in comparison with
similar accommodation. Stu-
dents are able to rent either
single, double or treble
rooms, the rents being £3,
£2 10s., and £2 and can
apply for the multiple rooms
as a group. Each student is
provided with a chest .of
drawers, bureau, and shelves
in a Ladderax unit, a coffee
table, a wardrobe, a bed, a
working chair and an arm-
chair. Residents are provi-
ded with linen and bedding
which they have to launder
themselves. In each House
there are also communal
kitchens with cookers and
refrigerators, a small lounge
with easy chairs and a tele-
vision, and also a laundry
with an automatic washing
machine, drying and ironing
facilities.
Although the Student
Houses cannot provide all
the facilities which the Halls
provide, they are distinctly
cheaper, better and nearer
than any other place in
which students may live.
Moreover besides their fin-
ancial advantage, they have
less obvious advantages such
as no rents to pay over vaca-
tions or the soul destroying
GRANTS PETITION
The grants petition which
was distributed to under-
graduates by year reps last
term has finally been sent to
the Secretary of State for
Education and Science Mr.
Edward Short. Just over
1,200 students' signatures
were collected.
Petition
The petition " deplored
the decision to award only
£25 out of the £50 increase
estimated as necessary to
maintain the students stand-
ard of living" and ended
" We believe that if the
Government continues to
adopt such policies the pre-
sent shortage of graduates in
science and technology will
become more acute and the
Government may be held
responsible for Britain fail-
ing to become more econom-
search for a room at the
beginning of each term.
Also being behind South
Kensington they are out of
the parking meter zone and
yet within easy walking dis-
tance of college.
So the Student Houses
are a real alternative to the
Halls of Residence; and
remember, one of the next
three Houses will be one

The National Union of
Students conference in Nov-
ember passed a motion
instructing their executive to
run a grants campaign dur-
ing this Spring to put
pressure on the Government
mainly to increase grants by
£25 but also to change grants
system for Dip. Ed. and
some B.Ed, students.
The conference also urged
that postgraduate awards be
negotiated in the same way
as undergraduate awards
and that NUS be permitted
to submit evidence in the
matter. The same motion
had a clause strongly urging
that a London differential
for P.G. awards be insti-
tuted immediately.
Meeting
I.C. observes at the grants
sub-committee meeting of
the London Regional Organ-
isation of NUS. At the
moment L.R.O. is only co-
ordinating grants campaign
activity and is not initiating
any action of its own except
for a meeting on grants
tentatively on March 19th
with Shirley Williams as
main speaker for the Gov-
ernment.

RECORD REVIEWS
Rhinoceros EKS 74030
Following their first sin-
gle release a few weeks ago,
here is Rhinoceros' album.
'Rhinoceros' comprises seven
top musicians from Ameri-
can groups, who recorded
this L.P. last year.
The origins of the group
are evident in the exactness
and skill with which the
numbers are performed; the
songs are mostly penned by
group members. They do
seem to be biased towards
by Phemius
live performance however,
and most of the songs are
of the powerful, uncomplex
type which are not particu-
larly well suited for the
translation to record.
I liked a number of the
tracks, notably 'Belbuekus',
' Along comes tomorrow',
and the two tracks which
are on their single. Perhaps
here is a clue: I've come to
like the single tracks after
some four weeks of hearing
them — maybe the whole

Saga PSY 30001—
" The Children of Lir "
Called by the Irish Bards
" the second sorrow of story-
telling ", "The Children of
Lir " is an Irish legend tell-
ing the story of Lir's four
children, Tinola, Aed, Fiaca
and Conn. The children were
cursed to become swans for
900 years by Lir's second
wife in a fit of jealousy.
Eventually the swans are
stirred by a church bell and
change into three ancient
men and one old woman to
be baptised and die in the
Christian faith.
The poem, written by
Michael Simpson depicts the
story as he believes the old
Irish monks told it, as a
parable. The language used
is simple and descriptive,
greatly enhanced by Robert
Lamb's symphonic preludes
and Ferdy Mayne's moving
rendering.
The music ranges from
classical through jazz to
m o d e r n contemporary.
Lamb's composition not
only adds greatly to the
poem but should be consid-
ered as seven musical com-
positions, held together by
the words of-Michael Simp-
son.
The record is worth ob-
taining for both its poetry
and its original, enjoyable
music.
