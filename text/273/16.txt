The Case for the Constituent College Unions
Constituent College Unions have e x i s t e d for approximately 70
years w i t h i n the Imperial College Uniona T h e i r o r i g i n a l existance
was j u s t i f i e d for the simple reason that the students wanted them to
e x i s t . There were f a r fewer students i n Imperial College when i t a l l
s t a r t e d than there are now i n e i t h e r G u i l d s . R . C . S . , or probably Mines -
but f o r the sake of promoting i n t e r - c o l l e g e r i v a l r y and developing
' s p i r i t ' both sentiments heavily knocked by many these days - the
o r i g i n a l students wanted the constituent colleges to e x i s t w i t h i n I . C . U .
As i s obvious to a l l . the s i t u a t i o n i s very d i f f e r e n t now.
Whether students as a whole s t i l l b e l i e v e t h a t , for the sake of r i v a l r y and
s p i r i t alone, constituent c o l l e g e s should e x i s t , i s now only a minor p o i n t .
The most important consideration i s the r o l e the constituent c o l l e g e s now
have to play w i t h i n I . C .
I . C . U . i s now so large an i n s t i t u t i o n that i t i s a major task to run
i t e f f e c t i v e l y and well - for the benefit of the students. In t h i s context
I b e l i e v e the most important aspect of Unicn A d m i n i s t r a t i o n to be the r e -
a l l o c a t i o n of the Union Grant i n such a way as to enable as m ny i n d i v i d u a l
students as p o s s i b l e to have a say i n how t h e i r money i s used. Constituent
College Clubs, such as the Maths & Physics S o c . , the Chem. Eng. S o c , . the
Mining and M e t a l l u r g i c a l S o c . , a l l have t h e i r respective grants c o n t r o l l e d
by the Constituent College Unions - r e l i e v i n g I . C . U . of the burden of t h i s
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n - and enabling students i n the relevant t e c h n o l o g i c a l f i e l d ..
to d i r e c t l y c o n t r o l the S o c i e t y .
There are many other s o c i e t i e s and clubs i n s i m i l a r s i t u a t i o n s and
to c o n t r o l them through I v C . , would necessitate the i n t r o d u c t i o n of many
more committees or sub-committees, which would have to be chanelled through
a c e n t r a l committee - probably C o u n c i l . Tc me, t h i s i s to c l u t t e r up and
confuse the s i t u a t i o n n e e d l e s s l y .
. Within each Constituent College Union i s an Academic A f f a i r s Committee.
The benefit to the student of these committees has been proved ever since
t h e i r i n t r o d u c t i o n , net only by improved Staff/Student r e l a t i o n s h i p s , but
a l s o , i n many cases by improvements to p a r t i c u l a r courses as a r e s u l t of
_work done by the Committees. Trying to organise the same set up on an I . C .
basis would, I b e l i e v e , r e s u l t i n poorer communication between staff/students
because the o r g a n i s a t i o n would be too big and impersonal.
Considering the executive side of I X A d m i n i s t r a t i o n , the present
system not only works -- and despite what the knockers say, works well -
but guarantees a permanent c r o s s - s e c t i o n of opinion on the Executive
Committee,
One f i n a l point about the Constituent Colleges - i n a d d i t i o n to the
fact that they have a great h i s t o r y - they s t i l l add a tremendous amount
of character to Imperial College - character which i s the envy of most
other London Colleges and frequently expressed as cynicism by them.
The Case against Constituent College Unions
The business the Constituent Colleges deal with can be divided i n t o
three main areas : -
1. Entertainment i , organised e n t s , , b a l l s , c a r n i v a l
smoking concerts e t c .
i i , c a r n i v a l (rag) and other i n t e r -
college r i v a l r y (swimming g a l a ) .
2. Clubs & S o c i e t i e s (sporting and academic)
3. Academic A f f a i r s
