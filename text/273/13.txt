Against N . U . S . continued
F i n a l l y , the cost of j o i n i n g M.U.S. For Imperial Union to j o i n
as one body would cost Â£1000 (5/- per head). The Union i s at present
on a very t i g h t budget and has more important things to spend i t s money
on. In any case, what i s the point of spending a l l t h i s money when we
cannot e f f e c t i v e l y get anything i n return that we cannot get elsewhere?.
5. The Case f o r a S a b b a t i c a l Year for the President of the Union
With academic work to do, i t i s h i g h l y impracticable for the
President to be i n touch with students. With no acadesicc work, he would
have the time to go the rounds meeting h i s f e l l o w students. Far from
being a p r o f e s s i o n a l P r e s i d e n t , he could be i n better contact with student
o p i n i o n . Thus he would be far better able to act i n the best i n t e r e s t s
of the m a j o r i t y .
The President would have more time to devote to E x t e r n a l A f f a i r s ,
as well as I n t e r n a l ones - E x t e r n a l A f f a i r s at t h i s c o l l e g e tend to be
rather neglected.
Also i t i s p o s s i b l e that with a s a b b a t i c a l year we may get a t h i r d -
year or p r e - P . G . (better) w i l l i n g to take on the j o b . Of l a t e the choice
for President has been l i m i t e d , and there i s not much point having a
democratic e l e c t i o n system i f there i s only one candidate.
The Case Against a Sabbatical Year f o r the President
The p r i n c i p l e arguement against a s a b b a t i c a l year i s that i t i s not
at present necessary. This i s true at I . C . and perhaps not so at other
c o l l e g e s - mainly because the Constituent College Presidents deal d i r e c t l y
with the academic s t a f f , a function which elsewhere might f a l l to the
Union P r e s i d e n t , i n a d d i t i o n to h i s other d u t i e s . As a r e s u l t of t h i s ,
the job at present occupies about h a l f of an average day.
I f the President had a sabbatical year, then i t weald be considerably
more d i f f i c u l t to appreciate some of the problems c f the average student,
and so be a genuine representative. A l s o , one of the many functions of
the Union i s to give students some experience of o r g a n i s a t i o n . The
move to a s a b b a t i c a l year could push almost a l l of t h i s work onto one
person, w h i l s t the present system allows the load to be spread over many
people and over a wider range of o p i n i o n s .
F i n a l l y , the establishment of a s a b b a t i c a l year would be expensive
to the Union, since the grant for the P r e s i d e n t ' s year of o f f i c e would
have to come out of the Union income.
6. E l e c t i o n of President and Secretary by a College b a l l o t
General The present system i s that the president and secretary are
elected by the j o i n t incoming and outgoing members of c o u n c i l . The
candidates can be from the whole c o l l e g e . The proposal has been mooted
that the system be changed so that the e l e c t i o n i s by a b a l l o t of the
whole c o l l e g e . This system i s used at a number of colleges but l i t t l e
research has been done by I . C . to a s c e r t a i n i t s e f f e c t i v e n e s s . I t has
also been suggested that the President and Secretary should run f o r o f f i c e
i n p a i r s of candidates.
M e r i t s of Proposed system The President and secretary represent the whole
c o l l e g e and as such should have the f u l l democratic backing of a majority
of the c o l l e g e and not just c o u n c i l . Much of the apathy associated with
i s o l a t e d beaurocracies can be a l l e v i a t e d by the involvement of the whole
people i n determining the future leaders.
