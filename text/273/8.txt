RCSU dissociate from Guilds motion
The R.C.S.U. Extraordinary Meeting last Tuesday lunch-
time, held in the main Physics Lecture Theatre, was attended
by over 200 students. The primary purpose of the meeting was
to debate the motion that "R.C.S. Union dissociates itself
from the recent C and G motion (passed at the emergency
meeting of Friday, 31st January) and requests R.C.S. President
to inform the press that C and G is not I.C."
This motion was proposed by Martin Bland who went into
details about iron gates and also about the misrepresentation
of I.C. by the national newspapers. His opposer, Pete Dolwin,
had not prepared a speech and didn't really say very much.
The seconder for the opposition put the point a bit more
clearly saying that if such a motion was carried, and the
national press heard about it, they would naturally assume
that R.C.S. was in support of the recent actions of L.S.E.
At this point, Piers Corbyn decided to suggest an amend-
ment to the motion; the amendment being that R.C.S. believes
that the solution to the problems of L.S.E. should be left in
the hands of the L.S.E. students' union. Various people voiced
their opinion of the amendment (and of P. Corbyn as well),
but when it came to voting on whether or not the amendment
should be made, those in favour won by a large majority.
The first speaker for the amendment motion was an ex-
L.S.E. student who claimed that L.S.E. students had been
quite justified in their actions. The opposition maintained that
with the amendment the press would be even more likely to
misrepresent R.C.S.'s decisions if the motion was passed. Les
Ebdon attempted to speak about the "militant apathy in C
and G " until it was discovered that he hadn't even been
present at the Guilds meeting in question and therefore didn't
know what he was talking about. An R.C.S. student who had
been at that meeting began to tell us the truth about the
meeting but in the face of repeated interruptions and the swift
passage of time, he was unable to finish his speech.
The motion was then put to the vote and carried by 123
votes to 89 with 13 abstentions.
The second motion was to condemn the letter sent to Lord
Penney a fortnight before. Jeff Warren, proposing the motion,
claimed that the letter was an insult to Lord Penney and that
the forty students concerned had had no right to make these
demands on behalf of the whole of the College. The only
opposition came from Les Ebdon—not surprisingly, as he
helped to write the letter.
As time rapidly ran out, his views including the one that
people should try and think about the real root of the prob-
lem, the concept of a university, were disregarded and the
motion was carried on a show of hands.
Hard days for
Carnival ahead
Tonight sees the first of
Imperial College's two con-
certs at the Albert Hall, when
Spencer Davis tops the bill
for the Carnival Committee's
hopeful big money-raiser. At
the time of writing, it seems
that tickets will still be avail-
able so, if you fancy a night-
out, give carnival some much
needed support as well.
Meanwhile, on the Ents front,
the continuing tale of their
concert goes on from strength
to strength. The Crazy World
of Arthur Brown are crying
out of their commitments,
including next Thursday's
Ents concert. So who have
Ents got instead—none other
than one of their previous
choices: The Bonzo Dog
Band. Since the tickets had
'Bonzo Dog' printed on them
before Ents got Arthur Brown
instead, the re-arrival of
Bonzo Dog is doubly fortu-
itous.
On the financial side, Car-
nival is not doing too well at
all. The last estimate for col-
lections is £1,365 and the
cash from the Carnival Walk
is being very slow in coming
in. At the present rate of sy-
phoning money from the
public, IC don't stand a
chance of getting anything
like the £12,000 that the
National Council for the Un-
married Mother and her
Child need if they are to be
saved from financial collapse.
With exams coming up in the
summer term, the bulk of the
money will have to be col-
lected before Easter. Success
means everybody pulling
their fingers out in the re-
maining four weeks of term.
Penney passes letter to Council
Copy of the letter sent to
Rex Lowin, I.C. President, by
the Rector. This was sent to
Lowin on 3rd February.
It concerns, first, the
motion passed by Guild's
Union on 31st January and,
secondly, the letter sent to
Lord Penney by P. Corbyn
on behalf of 40 I.C. students
on the 30th January, both as
reported in the last issue of
Felix.
Dear President,
I enclose copies of two communications I received on
Friday last. The first is a published statement of a series of
resolutions passed by the City and Guilds Union. The second
is a letter addressed to me and signed by Mr. Corbyn on
behalf of about 40 students.
As Rector, I am of course always available and very
pleased to discuss with a student any particular matter where
he or she is seeking my advice or help. The letter from Mr.
Corbyn is a completely different kind of approach, where I
am called on to give assurances on some hypothetical
questions and also to interfere in the affairs of another
university institution.
I feel that to receive and answer group representations puts
me in the position of acknowledging that the proper channels
for the communication and expression of student opinion—
namely the Union can be by-passed.
I should be grateful therefore if you and the Union Council
would consider Mr. Corbyn's letter and let me know if you
wish on behalf of the Union to make any representations to
me on the points he makes.
Yours sincerely,
Penney.

Governors have been invited
and several have already
accepted. An invitation has
also been sent to the Minister
of Education, Mr. Edward
Short.
Several more fork suppers
are to be arranged; the
Rector will be the guest at
the next one, later this term.
A suggestion that Enoch
Powell be invited to another
supper had caused some con-
troversy, but it was later
decided not to invite him.

Bicycle shed
Contrary to last week's
Sennet, IC has not taken
over the Albert Hall as a
bicycle shed. We did, in fact,
requisition the Alb' last year
for a Railway Station.

£180,000 for college appeal
Following Council's request
at the last JURGO meeting
the Rector offered represent-
ation on the Development
Committee.
Rex Lowin was placed in
the embarrassing position of
reporting that Council had
decided against it, and
wanted some other 'machin-
ery' set up.
The 3 Deans reported that
information on the marking
of examination papers and on
the relative weightings of
courses were being made
more generally available.
The expected continuation
of the discussions on discip-
line, begun last term, was
avoided by the Rector who
proposed that a working
party should be set up to
draw together all the con-
flicting views. The three main
points are : double punish-
ment, the powers of Wardens
and bringing the name of the
College into disrepute.
It was reported that
£180,000 had been promised
for the College Appeal to
date, most from Banks, Insur-
ance and the Stock Exchange.
Barry Hood suggested that
1C should have commercials
on TV. Mr. Holbein thought
that LSE and other student
troubles did not help our
cause but that the publicity
following the C & G motion
was 'good'.
The Pro - Rector, L o r d
Jackson, gave a very inter-
esting report on ' Growth
Points' in IC; saying ' we
must project ourselves into
the future ', in which he could
see increasing numbers of
interdisciplinary specialities.
Attention was drawn to Sir
Robin Darwin's ( R C A
Rector) recent address to the
court of the R C A in which
embarrassing allegations were
made about the behaviour of
the Dept. of Ed. & Sc. (and
hence IC) in negotiations
over the site proposed for the
Architectural Association
building.
