Stand or Fall? Egoistic
Ebdon?
Dear Sir,
I should like to say how
impressed I was by the very
definite improvement in the
last issue of FELIX; not
only in printing and layout,
but also in content and the
factual style of reporting.
One thing, however, that
requires comment is that Mr.
Ebdon should use his opinion
column (I doubt if anyone
would agree with his state-
ment that it is a " news
column not an opinion
column") to describe ideas
that he has put forward to
the constitutional reform
committee as " promising
and vital." That appears to
be slightly egoistical.
A further note. Speakers
at our meeting may have
been jeered but none were
" shouted down" no matter
what the national papers
may say. Isn't it ludicrous
that while one group who
opposed the motion have
distributed sheets complain-
ing about the press reporting
of the event as " misrepre-
senting, misreporting, mis-
leading " you tell us to read
the nationals for an account
of what actually happened.
Yours sincerely,
Dermott Corr
London School of Hygiene
& Tropical Medicine
Dear Sir,
I was disgusted to read in
the National press the report
of " students of I.C." issuing
hysterical statements about
LSE. Fortunately I have
since learnt the true facts—
that it was the opinions of a
small minority of militant
right-wingers—and the press,
not unusually, had failed to
make this point clear. Despite
this it is still extremely dis-
turbing to find out that these
students had failed to use
their intelligence sufficiently
to study the situation before
making such grossly in-
accurate remarks. One won-
ders whether the taxpayer is
getting full value for his
money—scientists with unin-
quisitive minds ?
No Riots
I took the trouble to
attend the discussions at
U.L.U. (which certainly be-
came more dynamic and
attractive during the occupa-
tion) and to talk to L.S.E.
students, including repre-
sentatives of the " moderate "
minority. At no time were
there " riots", academic
thuggery, intimidation etc.,
which were all described so
vividly in the press. The re-
ports in the press indicated
that the press had been to
completely different meetings
to those I attended, though
they claimed them to be the
same. As some of your stu-
dents know I am a little left
of centre, but more conserva-
tive colleagues of mine will
also witness to the lies of the
press.
Bad Reputation
It's about time the stu-
dents of Imperial got off
their fat arses and started
thinking of others, and not
just themselves. No college in
the country has a worse
reputation for its students'
attitudes—you'll find out
when you leave. And if you
continue to make statements
as nonsensical as the ones
made about Tariq Ali the
situation can only worsen.
You are the students who
are wasting the taxpayers
money—your prejudices, lack
of thought and investigation
and your conclusions founded
on no evidence are hardly
indicative of good scientists.
Tf you look at those at I.C.
who have had enough social
conscience to concern them-
selves with moral and
political problems you'll
probably find a rather high
academic standard also.

opinions of Felix.
Battery Bred
Imperial College will only
achieve what it could do
when it stops producing its
battery bred apathetics and
starts giving the country
some free range products.
Finally I'd like to remind
I.C. of its past, I like to
think it's changed, a record
of drunken violence against
property and persons. One
only has to look through
FELIX for the damage to
property, and some of the
attacks on persons (Morphy
Day etc.). While I was at I.C.
several people were beaten
up by one well known per-
sonality on one night and no
action was taken. I myself
received a warning, ad-
dressed from certain rugby
players, to watch out on a
dark night, because I
wished to make the Union
more democratic. Also an
T.C. President, during his
term of office, threatened to
smash my head in for
opposing him.
Before condemning L.S.E.
for violence against steel
gates placed there to pro-
voke, look at your own un-
justified, meaningless vio-
lence.
You really make me want
to puke.
Yours very sincerely,
Malcolm Duckett
Dear Sir,
Freedom is not a luxury
but the recognition of neces-
sity. But democracy in this
country is based upon the
idea that it is a concession
allowed to us by the generous
authorities, and is built up
in terms of a static morality
based on ideas of absolute
right and wrong, which it is
wrong to challenge. As
Moses said, " thou shalt
not kill", " thou shaft not
commit adultery ", and now
from FELIX " thou shalt
not stir up trouble where no
trouble exists ". But how can
killing be always wrong,
adultery always wrong and
most confusing of all how
on earth can trouble be
stirred up where, we are told
no trouble exists.
The ' trouble ' is socialists.
We do exist and come to our
conclusions and act upon
them in such a way as to
achieve the most success,
and publicise our point of
view in the most effective
way. Obedience is the same
virtue as mediocrity in a
mediocre society. The contra-
diction of minority action
not being condemned by the
majority will always be with
us. Democracy is for the
protection of minorities. If
democracy means more than
hot air it means freedom to
dissent and take action in-
side the existing structures
(which are ridiculous enough
anyway).
The majority can dissoci-
ate themselves, as they have
done: (C&G Union made
absolute fools of themselves;
R.C.S. Union were more
civilised). The minority who
sent the letter have insulted
Sir,
The criticism from I.C. of
the L.S.E. students centres
around the use of violence.
Bearing in mind the records
of the groups concerned
(need I say Morphy ?) and
the fact that the L.S.E. stu-
dents only attacked selected
objects, not persons, and
only after much discussion,
this is hypocrisy bordering
on the illogical. One may
conclude that they do not
condemn violence, but mass
political action.
Mass action is something
strange to I.C.; it is not
understood and is feared.
People feel it might some-
how lead to totalitarianism.
Their answer is to leave the
command of information and
decision making to the con-
trolling hierarchy, who rein-
force their position by resist-
ing change in most aspects of
college life. Occasionally,
however, even the doziest
student wants to change
s o m e t h i n g . When such
no-one, but have as yet not
even received an acknow-
ledgement which is less than
courteous of the Rector.
Now what about the letter
itself ? We asked the Rector
to clarify his position on
certain fundamental prin-
ciples of freedom in universi-
ties (implied by our ques-
tion):
(1) Freedom of movement
and hence association.
(2) Political freedom from
Police.
(3) Academic freedom from
commercial and govern-
ment interest.
(4) No victimisation for
Political views.
We wonder if the National
Committee of Vice Chancel-
lors and Principals (NCVCP)
has any coherent view of
these questions. We are sure
that even those who feel we
are ' irresponsible' to ask
these questions would like
to know the answers.
In the second part of the
letter we ask Lord Penney
to help solve the problem by
using his influences, which
are c o n s i d e r a b l e :
N.C.V.C.P.; Sir Sidney Caine
(ex L.S.E. Director) and Dr.
Ware (chairman of JURGO's
recent subcommittee, who
are both on the Governing
Bodies of I.C. and L.S.E.;
Dr. Adams is alternatively
chairman with Lord Penney
of the joint I.C.-L.S.E. com-
mittee on administration
technology & economics;
House of Lords; Industry.
I.C. and L.S.E. are not as
separate as most people have
been led to believe, neither
are universities in general,
industry and the govern-
ment, as was clearly demon-
strated by Ted Short's bitter
opinion clashes with the
policies of the administra-
tion, we see the true power-
structure.
I.C. is very proud of its
staff-student relations, feat-
uring countless committees
where both sides get together
and discuss matters REAS-
ONABLY. What if both
sides reason differently ? The
student-reps on J.U.R.G.O.,
for instance, may not be
mandated on any line of
policy, and thus, as they
meet the Rector as isolated
individuals, personal pres-
sure on them is inevitable.
But then, what if the Union
were to negotiate over some-
thing ? Negotiations only
mean anything when the two
parties command comparable
power. The Rector is not
going to grant anything
against his own wishes and is
usually only approached
over changes that he would
implement anyway.
Castrated politicos like
Philip Marshall recognise
attack on student socialists.
Students stand or fall to-
gether.
Yours etc.,
Matthew Duncan Jones
Chairman Soc.Soc.
Piers Corbyn
Chairman I.C.P.A.G.
this situation and its effect
on the awareness of most
students, accept it as inevit-
able and contrive to make it
all seem rather jolly.
L.S.E. students, however,
have recently shown us the
a l t e r n a t i v e s . They too,
eventually recognised the
futility of negotiations, but
did not just give up. They fell
back upon their ordy
strength : their numbers and
the level of their committee.
Whether or not their de-
mands are eventually satis-
fied, they have clearly
demonstrated the superiority
of direct mass involvement
over any other method of
participtation, with regard to
both accurate representation
and effectiveness.
It is clear then why mass
action is so feared and
slandered by those who con-
trol our environment and so
many of our attitudes. It is a
direct challenge to their
positions.

Traitor or Arbiter?
Sir,
Originally this letter was
written two months ago, but
was never sent to Felix.
It was with a great deal of
interest and incredulity that
one read " They tell me
. . ." by Les Ebdon, which
appeared in Felix published
the 11th December.
Let us agree that nobody
should be punished twice for
the same offence; this is a
very old principle in English
Common Law. However,
consider a case of arson com-
mitted by a student within
the college. Local magis-
trates are very unpredictable.
The student may escape
with only a six months pro-
bation. What does the col-
lege do ? Should not it
protect the other students
and administer a punish-
ment. For example, restrict-
ing the student from handling
expensive equipment or any-
thing hazardous to other
students.
According to I.C. Council,
at that time, the College
should do nothing. The I.C.
Council wish to put the
principle of "no double
punishment" into the I.C.
code of discipline without
any reservation. This is
much too inflexible and may
be subject to abuse. Surely it
would be better to agree in
principle to "no double
punishment". but for the
College to reserve the right,
in certain cases, to safe-
guard the well-being of
other students.
As an individual in a free
society I demand the right to
speak freely. It is most un-
fortunate that Mr. Ebdon
should regard a free-speaking
individual as having " sold-
out" to the I.C. Council
decision, particularly when
the individual concerned
never agreed with the orig-
inal decision for the reasons
stated.
Now, two months later,
the I.C. Council has agreed
to what a few have jokingly
called " The Hood Solu-
tion ". It is a great pity that
originally the voice of
reason did not prevail and
that no-one showed any far-
sightedness into the matter.
It is also strange how one
may hold one view stead-
fastly, and be judged traitor
one day and arbiter the next
according to the whim of
public opinion.
Yours etc.,
