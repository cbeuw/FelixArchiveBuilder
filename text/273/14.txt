E l e c t i o n of President and Secretary by a College B a l l o t continued.
The campaign can be used by the candidates to put forward points of
p o l i c y and thus e l e c t i o n can be made on the b a s i s of merit rather than
which candidate has bought the most d r i n k s f o r c o u n c i l . This i s why we
want a p l e b i s c i t e .
Merits of Present system
The type or person who w i l l be most suitable, as President or Secretary i s
better known by c o u n c i l who are b e t t e r informed of the candidate's v i r t u e s
than the general c o l l e g e . Council has to work i n close l i a i s o n with both
the president and Secretary and i t i s thus better that they should choose
people with whore they can work i n harmony. An intimate knowledge of the
views and ideas of the candidates can be b u i l t up during the i n t e n s i v e
canvassing p r i o r to the e l e c t i o n . There i s no p o s s i b i l i t y of r i g g i n g the
e l e c t i o n . This system h.s& proved i t s effectiveness and should not be
changed f o r one that i s , to say the l e a s t , unproved.
7. Case f o r Departmental Reps on Council
Having Depcurtmental Reps on Council would produce several useful
r e s u l t s .
F i r s t l y , the Depto Rep. would provide (at l a s t ) the much needed l i n k
between I . C . U . , the year reps, and the ttudent f l o o r . The concept of
Departmental Subcommittees (which e s p e c i a l l y i n t h i s k i n d of u n i v e r s i t y
Should provide the backbone of any f l e x i b l e and e f f i c i e n t union a d m i n i s t r a -
t i o n ) would achieve more prominence, and the clumsy and l i m i t e d channels
of communication v i a the constituent c o l l e g e s wo^ld be bypassed.
Secondly, while providing -â€¢. b e t t e r contact between I . C . U . and
i t s members, a departmental rep, i s most l i k e l y to be an independent
whose aim i s s e r v i n g the student i n t e r e s t , and not t h a t of perpetuating
the present petty p o l i t i c a l scene.
T h i r d l y , when the A r c h i t e c t u r a l A s s o c i a t i o n j o i n s us, t h i s system
i s the one which w i l l most e a s i l y accommodate them.
The majority of students are apathetic as regards I . C . U . because
they f e e l they have l i t t l e or no connection with i t . The greater personal
contact between students, dept. reps and year r e p s . , (a much abused and
neglected group of people doing very useful and important work) w i l l make
not only f o r a much more e f f e c t i v e union, but one which also serves i t s
members i n the way that they want i t .
Case Against Departmental "ueps on Council
At present Council c o n s i s t s of 24 members of the Union and three o l d
student reps and a Senior Treasurer. I f departmental reps were on council
i t would become a very unwieldy body and Council i s an organising body
to deal with finance and d i s c i p l i n e and i s an easier body to manage i f i t s
members have s p e c i f i c j o b s . Departmental reps would not. 3y having these
reps on Council there would be a ' c e n t r a l i s a t i o n of power' which i s contrary
to most peoples b l i e f s at present. Major p o l i c y decisions would be made
by c o u n c i l because i t would be f e l t that i t was oiore representative of the
Union members views, but t h i s would take away the usefulness of the Union
meeting. In my opinion Council should be l e f t at the s i z e i t i s , enabling
the Union General meeting to make the major p o l i c y d e c i s i o n s , ( a n d the
v a s t l y d i f f e r i n g s i z e s of the departments could lead to over-representa-
t i o n i n some cases,)
