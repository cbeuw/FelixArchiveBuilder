For N . U . S . - What We w i l l Gain
Last Tuesday I went along to see what the N . U . S . was a l l about and
came back w i t h an armful of t r a v e l brochures, insurance schemes and copies
of 'New S t u d e n t ' . We would gain very l i t t l e i n terms of concessions (except
s i m p l i f i c a t i o n ) by j o i n i n g and they are mostly abroad. The s o l i d p o l i t i c a l
issue i s whether I . C . can gain from the wealth of experience the N . U . S . has
i n student a f f a i r s and the answer i s - of course, p o s i t i v e . I t ' s w e l l worth
I . C . j o i n i n g for a number of reasons.
For instance, the J o i n t Committee of the Union, the Governors and the
Rector (JURGO - look i t up i n the Calendar, P.33) has been d i s c u s s i n g
student d i s c i p l i n e . The N . U . S . has been consulted by the Department of
Education and Science on t h i s and has produced a well-thought out pamphlet
(Code of D i s c i p l i n e ) i n d i c a t i n g g u i d e l i n e s for general procedures, one of
which i s no double punishment. The N . U . S , view here coincides with the I . C . U ,
view on d i s c i p l i n a r y committees and double punishment.
Ted Short, Secretary of State for Education and Science has s a i d that
"Students who had genuine grievances about . . . . . . u n i v e r s i t i e s . . . . . would
f i n d almost i n v a r i a b l y today that they were negotiable and that they were
pushing at an open door". The N . U . S , quite c l e a r l y can help us here.
The N . U . S . i s the only n a t i o n a l student union with mass membership
and what i t says i s taken as being the student point of view. We must have
a share i n shaping that point of view.
The cost of j o i n i n g i s 5/- f o r students i n an a f f i l i a t e d union, Â£2

A u t h o r i t y with the fees e t c .
The N.Uc.Sc produces many useful p u b l i c a t i o n s on t r a v e l , grants, rents,
insurance, education, p a r t i c i p a t i o n , vacation work, discounts advice and
d i s c i p l i n e d
N . U . S , i s our n a t i o n a l students union and while i t leaves much to be
-desired the N . U . S . i s the student view. We must end our i s o l a t i o n and take
part i n the N . U . S .
Against N . U . S .
N . U . S . promised the following to students.
1. To look after student welfare and to speak for students
by b u i l d i n g up a p o l i c y over the years.
2. To provide cneap t r a v e l
3. To enable students to obtain c e r t a i n p r i c e reductions
and concessions.
As regards the f i r s t point of student welfare and representation,
Imperial College Union i s large enough to put forward i t s own views t o
the M i n i s t r y of Education and U . G . C . , and i n fact has done so very
e f e c t i v e l y i n the p a s t . I t i s b e t t e r f o r each Union to put forward i t s
own needs, ather than have i t done for them by such a large o r g a n i s a t i o n
as N . U . S ,
On the second point of cheap t r a v e l , most of us now know of many other
other organisations such as G . S . T . S . , I . S . T . S . , B r i a n Hughes L t d . , which
provide t r a v e l at p r i c e s comparable with and, i n many cases, b e t t e r than
those of N , U . S .
You have a l l heard of the g l i t t e r i n g promises of concessions which
N . U . S . has obtained and how hollow many of these promises are. N . U . S .
claims to p u b l i s h 1500 concessions and I have found out that many of t h i s
number do not e x i s t . Dominion Press issue a p u b l i c a t i o n containing 3500
concessions,at a cost of only 2 / l l ,
c o n t i n u e d . . . . .
