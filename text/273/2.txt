Yeoman of the Guard
"The Yeomen of the
Guared" by Gilbert and Sul-
livan, this year's production
by the I.C. Operatic Society,
was colourful and sur-
prisingly good, considering
the size of the stage. The
thud of the axe into the
block in the execution scene
was obviously designed to de-
light the hearts of ardent G.
& S, fans. The chorus work
was in general sound, though
the blend of singers and
orchestra was not always
what it might have been.
Undoubtedly, the star of
the show from the acting
point of view was Richard
Hull whose brilliant por-
trayal of the Head Jailor and
Assistant Tormentor brought
w e l c o m e interludes of
humour. John Bass did well
with the difficult part of
Jack Point, the strolling
Jester, and the singing of
Colin Davis, Colonel Fairfax,
certainly approached profes-
sional standards. A l l the
principals attained a good
standard of performance and
the quartets were very well
balanced.
It is a pity that all the
dramatic productions at I.C.
are so badly attended for the
first performance—although
not quite up to West End
standards the productions
are worthy of more support.
The show was very well re-
ceived by the audience and
there were numerous curtain
calls.

THEV
TELL
ME
by Les Ebdon
So much has happened since this column was last written
that one is hesitant to write anything unless it is overtaken
by events. The reverberations from LSE have caused changes
in attitudes in IC not far short of revolutionary.
The first Union reaction, from Guilds, to the LSE dispute
was predictable, especially with memories of the distasteful
events at ULU still fresh. The press, clutching at straws to
prove Ted Short's " agitator theory ", reported the affair in
lurid detail. Corr and Marshall must have come close to add-
ing a TV appearance to their other glamour prizes. Within a
week of this meeting RCSU and ICU passed radically
different motions. Why ?
Probably the attempts to present the Guilds' decision
traditionally a " sporty Union ", as a sign of support for the
Adams-Short hard-line attitude brought some reaction. The
idea that all the trouble at LSE is caused by thirteen
" academic thugs " is a far from satisfactory answer to the
complex student problems there. As rumours of the manner
in which the Guilds' meeting was called spread, and details
of its conduct discussed, further reaction was engendered.
One Guildsman told me : " I only heard about the meeting
on the morning and I was told the motion affected student
grants, but our year rep did not know the wording." Opposi-
tion speeches were apparently drowned in jeers.
Further stimulation to the radicalization of IC students
was given by the vote of the LSE students, at Friends House
on 3rd of February. The by now famous " no victimization,
no gates, no police" motion finally killed the " agitator
theory ".
It was these events, plus a new spirit amongst first and
second year undergraduates, and increased activity by over-
seas students, that provided the majorities for the more
militantly worded motions of support for the LSE students
at both the RCSU and ICU meetings.
There were some attempts by the old guard right-wing to
quench this grass-roots fire. Chem. PG. rep., Rodney Hobbs,
Weeks hall's stirring barman, brought a large contingent of
Chemistry P.G.s to RCSU, but the establishment relied on
the old curse of inquoracy to prevent ICU passing any pro-
LSE motions. So great has the swing of opinion been that
even old-guard left-wingers have been amazed and outpaced
by popular opinion.
It now seems Certain that the ordinary member of ICU is
reaching out for some kind of power—let us hope we can all
use it responsibly.
After the last issue of Felix I received an anonymous
letter containing certain interesting " information " I do not
use anonymous letters but if " IC theatre-lover " would come
forward perhaps I can use what he tells me. Naturally I
would treat his identity as absolutely confidential.
