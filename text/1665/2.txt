Summerlovin’
S
ummer is officially here. You can tell by the
hoards of panting students waiting to get
served at FiveSixEight. You can also tell
because felix has succumbed to society’s
pressures and has dropped to half its
original weight in preparation for the
beach. For real though yesterday was so hot I almost
passed out while waiting to grab a coke at the bar.
Other tell-tale signs of the arrival of Summer include:
an increase in threats of libel, the evaporation of
the editorial team, our desperate use of freedom
of information requests to generate content, the
questionable quality of the centrefolds, the front
covers and overarching themes, and of course the
distinct feeling that everyone at Imperial has stopped
caring and is one curly fry away from giving up and
fucking off to some sea-side destination.
Still we’ll persevere. At least until mid-June. Then I’m
off on holiday.
This week we thought we’d do a homage to
everybody’s second home, the Central Library.
Imperial’s glistening rectangular temple of learning;
shrine of tears, sacrificial altar of broken dreams and
every delivery person’s favorite late night destination.
We wrote a retrospective on every major work it’s
undergone over the last decade, laced with insights
on expenditures gained from targeted freedom of
information requests.
We also took a look at the Central Library’s night owl
culture because clearly we have nothing better to do
than wander around the library after midnight and ask
people what they think of the toilets.
Sure, this edition might be a bit dry but so are our
parched mouths and if we had it our way we’d have
closed shop already. So enjoy and don’t forget, when
in a pinch use felix as a classy sun-hat.
