Imperial College Israel tech trip
I
would like to start by
thanking the committee
that spent days and nights
working hard to put this
amazing trip together. I
must say I’ve gained so
much from this trip in many
aspects.
I didn’t do any background
research on the destination
beforehand but went with the
hope of letting the country
and its people surprise me
while there. The whole expe-
rience started before even
checking in at the airport
when I was ‘interrogated’ for
10 minutes on lots of random
questions. These included
why do I study in the UK,
who packed my luggage, and
who has touched it during my
travel to the airport etc. After
that, I was cleared to pro-
ceed to check in. This made
me realise that this country
definitely prioritises security.
On the flight, my mind was
refreshed by the slogan of
in-flight duty free shopping:
“lowest price at highest
altitude”. This made me more
eager for the upcoming
tech trip and to find out how
this country has become a
world-leading start-up coun-
try whilst at war with most of
its neighbours.
Upon arrival, our tour guide
Yoni asked everyone to think
of the most embarrassing
story in our life and what we
learnt from it. While exchang-
ing our stories we laughed,
learned and started to under-
stand the spirit that makes
the Israeli State – people
here don’t fear failure, they
learn from it and rise again
on it! This spirit was further
seen in the many start-up
companies that we visited
later (Google, Intel, Reporty
etc.). While visiting these
start-up/technology compa-
nies, their successful business
models were discussed, the
new investing market was
explored and the latest prod-
ucts/ideas were introduced.
This was a well-rounded
learning experience.
Though each day’s agenda
was really packed, there was
a good combination of visit-
ing revolutionary companies
and mingling with the 40
other students on the trip from
across 12 Imperial depart-
ments. Every night we drank,
we danced, we chatted and
the next morning would wake
up at 6:30am for another
long day. To be honest, I only
had 3 hours sleep every day
for a week and I still don’t
know how I managed to live
through that. It was one of the
most colourful weeks of my
life! When I see the people
from the trip again on campus
now I really can feel there is
a special bond between all
of us!
The committee also
arranged dinner with local
Israeli university students
during the trip. I enjoyed
listening to these students
sharing their military
experience and how it has
toughened their personalities.
Personally, the most touch-
ing moment during this trip
was the visit to Yad Vesham.
We have all heard sad stories
about Jewish people from
WWII but actually standing
in the museum, seeing these
historical preserved objects
and listening to the stories
from Yoni everyone couldn’t
help but tear up. This heavy
history reminds humanity that
we shouldn’t let any similar
tragedy happen again to any
race.
We then moved on to visit
the holy city of Jerusalem.
Instead of seeing chaos and
conflicts between those of dif-
ferent religious beliefs I saw a
Jewish old man sat down with
a Christian old man having
tea and chatting about their
day. This wasn’t the picture I
held for Jerusalem but now I
could see there was friendship
between conflicting religions
in this so-called conflict city!

I
love travelling and
discovering new places.
So when I heard
about the trip to Israel
organised by the Israeli
society I jumped on
the opportunity to go to a
country I had never been
to. I expected to explore the
start-up and historic culture of
Israel, visit some companies
and sights and have a great
time. But the experience
was beyond all of my
expectations. It wasn’t great,
it was phenomenal! I came
back with so many incredible
memories of places, people
and moments, truly impressed
by this country built in such a
short amount of time and am
very realistically considering
living there at some point in
my life.
Everything we did was
interesting, captivating and
entertaining from the talks by
start-up legends to culinary
tours of the street markets of
both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem
to the visit to universities and
historical landmarks. We had
nearly no time off or sleep
but looking back none of us
would have had it any other
way.
I love food and consider
myself a very real food
tourist, so obviously I need to
mention the food as it was an
integral part of my experi-
ence. Shak-shuka, falafel,
shawarma, and of course my
constant hummus food-baby
were definite highlights of the
trip.
Our guide took us through
all the aspects of the state of
Israel, its history, its econom-
ical and political situation
and its people. I found it
especially important that we
met with locals to discuss and
get a perspective on what we
had learned about including
the start-up nation, the
military service, the history
of the Holocaust, the Jewish
religion, and student life. Not
only did we meet locals, but
we also met foreigners who

program, what made the
trip was the people. 40 of
us who didn’t all know each
other at the start yet in just 6
days we laughed, danced,
shared moments like we do
with friends we’ve known for
years. I met people from the
Business school that we never
usually interact with and dis-
covered a whole new aspect
of Imperial that is full of the
funniest people ever. The dif-
ferences in age, nationalities,
subjects made it all the more
special.
I will be eternally grateful to
Daniel and the committee for
organising this fantastic trip.
Lecheim!
