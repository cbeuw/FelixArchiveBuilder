Doctor Who

alfway into the
latest season of
Doctor Who,
set to be Peter
Capaldi and
showrunner
Steven Moffat’s last, we have
yet to be disappointed. After
a rocky few seasons, the
show began to show signs of
recovery with last Christmas’
delightful, superhero themed
fix. The first six episodes of
series ten have continued
this upward trend, with new
companion Bill proving to be
quite a highlight, and Capaldi
being allowed to flourish.
Finally, we get to see
Capaldi’s Doctor come
together in a coherent way.
Moffat has now established a
firm grip on the 12th
Doctor’s
personality; rough around
the edges, but not unkind
or mean-spirited as he often
seemed in previous series.
This Doctor is now more of a
Fagin or Willy Wonka figure.
It’s just a shame that this shift
in characterisation comes just
as Capaldi is set to leave. The
unique choice to make our
protagonist blind, albeit we
can infer temporarily, also
affords Peter Capaldi the
opportunity to flex his acting
muscle.
In fact, one must commend
Moffat on the choice to
seemingly make the Doctor’s
blindness a running plot
point. Given that the show’s
long history, it always runs
the risk of repeating itself. This
new development, however,
offers a range of intriguing
narrative possibilities to the
writers. Whether or not these
are seized fully, remains to be
seen. So far, at least, it has
been used in interesting ways.
Another welcome change
is the fresh dynamic between
Doctor and companion. Over
the past half-decade or so,
viewers have grown increas-
ingly frustrated by Moffat’s
need to make female com-
panions fawn romantically
over our lead. Thankfully,
this season instead opts for
a much more interesting
student-teacher dynamic. This
actually calls back to earlier
Doctors, and returns the
show to its roots somewhat.
Still, it is a dynamic we have
seen far too little of since the
series’ revival, and so offers
a necessary reprieve from the
constant lovesickness Doctor
Who has taken to wallowing
in recently. This treatment

enhances the Doctor’s larger
than life nature, and makes
the audience too feel like
they’re along for the TARDIS
ride.
Central to the success of
this new dynamic, of course,
is the new companion, Bill.
Pearl Mackie’s turn as the
Doctor’s latest accompa-
niment is a tour-de-force.
Mackie brings a youthful
energy, and refreshing
perspective to the show that,
in retrospect, it had really
been lacking. It helps that
she feels more grounded and
self-aware than some previ-
ous companions. Also worth
noting is that Bill Potts is the
Doctor’s first openly gay com-
panion. Here, again, Steven
Moffat deserves credit, as her
sexuality is handled with rela-
tive grace and poise. While it
is certainly commented upon
periodically, it does not ever
feel like an afterthought or a
tokenisation. Bill’s love life is
treated with as much respect
and comedy as previous
companions’.
Another of the strengths
of this season is that each
episode is relatively self-con-
tained, and there doesn’t yet
seem to be the sort of overuse
of continuity that had become
endemic of the last few years.
The decision to use new mon-
sters of the week keeps things
exciting, and also solves the
power creep problem for
classic villains by using them
sparingly. Additionally, while
the plots in the season so far
have been relatively straight
forward, they have been
exceed-
ingly

well executed. This excuses
much of the, admittedly
inevitable, recycling of villain
concepts, too. Subtle varia-
tions also help this; zombies
become Capitalist Space
Zombies. Worth special
mention is David Suchet’s
unnerving appearance as The
Landlord.
Naturally, the season
hasn’t been without its faults.
Mostly the typical issues that
plague Who, a bit too much
cheese here and there, and
obvious twists. A commend-
able exception to the latter
trend however, was found in
the season’s sixth episode,
‘Extremis’. The episode’s
A-plot was very unique as

far as concepts explored
in Doctor Who go, and its
genuinely bleak moments
were sobering. This is all
despite the tenuously linked,
although quite well acted
and funny, segments with the
Master. There is a risk that as
we flow into the second half
of the season with this plot-
line, we will once again fall
into the trap of circle-jerking
continuity too hard. However,
despite it seemingly being the
main plotline for the current
season, Moffat has managed
to keep it appropriately
restrained.
This season has been a
noticeable improve-
ment compared to
the last few, and I
actually look for-
ward to watching
new episodes
of Who again. I
hope this trend
continues through
the back half of
the season. I only
wish Capaldi could
have been allowed to
settle into this very com-
fortable groove earlier. If
only we could turn back time.
