More importantly though,
you might want to take a
closer look into the underlying
reasons behind your escapist
tendencies. Sooner or later,
you’re going to need to face
your problems. You can’t run
away from your commitments
forever and the longer you
wait, the worse things will get.

but UROP places fill out fast.
I
t should come as no
surprise to anyone that
life is a cruel mistress,
especially if you’re in uni.
With deadlines, exams
and project work, it can
quickly get overwhelming.
Things can also be insanely
frustrating (when for example,
you put all your heart and
soul into revising for a course
but you screw up the exam,
just because the compulsory
question was about waves
in the solar wind which you
obviously hadn’t revised
thoroughly because it barely
came up until now!).
And so, with all of life’s
hurdles thrown at you, no one
will blame you if you look for
means to escape. At Imperial,
the so called ‘geek culture’ is
great form of entertainment
and release. The real world is
brutal and sometimes you just
need to zone out in a fantasy
world.
Without the ability to
escape, we would all burn out
a lot faster. Sometimes we just
need to step away from our
problems, and return to them
with a fresh mind. Just don’t
take it too far. When escaping
turns into a pathology of
escapism, you might find you
have a problem. You might
recognise this as the point
where you’re neglecting all
your work, skipping lectures
and becoming a shut in to
have 15-hour sessions of
League of Legends. This could
be catalysed from anything
remotely negative, be it a
poorly marked lab report,
rejection from another job
application or just a bad day.
The key, like most things in
life, is to strike a balance and
make sure you remember to
snap back to reality at the
right time.
“How do I strike a
balance?” I hear you ask.
Let’s start by identifying
when you’re struggling with
escapism. If you find yourself
feeling disdain for the real
world and its subjects, and
a need for something better,
something separate to this
reality you might have a
problem. We’re not talking
about taking a break or
seeking some relief. The
latter is about building up
your energy for something
important as opposed
to abandoning the real
world for a ten-hour-long
Overwatch session. It may
seem simple, but gaining
perspective and recognising
when you’re crossing the line
is the first fundamental step to
In the words of Andrew Ryan
from Bioshock, “We all make
choices in life, but in the end
our choices make us.”
Escapism is a great defence
mechanism but watching the
entirety of 13 Reasons Why
isn’t going to help write up
your thesis (in fact if you’re
struggling with depression
or suicide, maybe stay away
from that one). You need to sit
down and identify the sources
of stress and upset in your
life. And when you’ve done
that, think of ways to tackle
them one baby step at a time.
Don’t forget, it’s OK to talk
to people and ask for help
whenever you need it, what-
ever the obstacle may be. No
one is perfect and most of us
have at some point sought out
support. Sometimes a friendly
voice is all you need to get
back on track.
Obviously, if you’ve been
hit by something major, you’re
not going to feel like tackling
it or thinking about it. But it
won’t do you any good to
shut yourself out altogether
and use artificial achieve-
ments to make up for it. Take
time off to feel better and
get whatever’s bothering you
out of your system. Then you
need to identify when you’re
ready to deal with things and
get back on your feet. It’ll
definitely be hard, and your
low self-esteem at the time
might be pushing you to stick
to the fantasy world, but you
can beat it and rise above
it. Your only worst enemy is
yourself.
Don’t get me wrong,
Dealing with escapism
binge-watching is fun and
spending my nights saving
princesses is basically how
I spend my holidays. Just
remember that you need to
live in the real world as well
and no amount of levelling
up can make you move for-
ward in life (unless you’re a
professional gamer but that’s
another story). At the end of
the day, everything comes
down to you, you’re the one
in control of your life. Taking
time off now and again to
unwind and entertain yourself
is fine, just as long as you
keep your priorities straight.
At the end of the day, fantasy
worlds are beautiful and
should be fully enjoyed, not
turned into harbours of guilt
and denial.
