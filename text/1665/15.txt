In defence of being flaky
Tessa Davey, professional flake and now officially a doctor, encourages you to follow your heart
and be the best flake you can be
B
e honest, we all
have that friend
who’s a complete
flake. You know,
you make plans
with them only to
have them cancel at the last
minute. Maybe this happens
repeatedly. They’re really
fucking annoying, right?
Maybe you don’t even want
to bother to reschedule.
Maybe they’re so flaky that
you eventually ghost them
as friends or maybe they
drive you nuts but something
keeps you from severing ties,
despite the mild dread that
comes every time you make
plans with them.
I am this person. I am a
massive flake. I am someone
who makes plans and can-
cels them all the time, and I
generally don’t feel at all bad
about it. It’s controversial,
I know. But before you just
push me aside as a terrible
person, hear me out.
People get hella angry
about flaking. Honestly, I
would say that the majority
of rants that I hear from my
friends about their social lives
are about people cancelling
on them at the last minute.
It is really annoying, I get
that. But I don’t think it’s the
cardinal sin that it’s made out
to be.
Perhaps it’s just the introvert
in me, but I’m not usually
hideously offended or put
out when someone cancels
on me. That’s not to say that
I wouldn’t otherwise have
made plans with someone
else if I had that evening/
afternoon/brunch slot free
– I have a perfectly active
social life with more friends
than I have time to see as
much as I want to see them,
I’m just not in the mood for
people. Sometimes, no matter
how much I love you and
no matter how much I enjoy
being around you, I will
not enjoy a social engage-
ment, and I will not be good
company.
And this is okay, It’s good to
recognise this. It’s better for
us both and for our friendship
exclusively say that cancelling
because you’re just not in
the mood isn’t an excuse,
because if you go anyway
you’ll end up having a good
time. I mean, great, if that’s
always the case for you, but
I know myself well enough to
be able to say what is gonna
cheer me up and what is not.
If I don’t want to see you right
inconvenienced someone.
There is now someone out
there either scrambling to
find someone else who has
been flaked on to hang out
with, or resigning themselves
to a slightly boring night in.
But you know what, that’s
not going to kill them. I have
no problems admitting that
I’m going to put myself first
day to day, and if that means
cancelling plans, so be it.
Like, don’t be a dick. If
you’re consistently cancelling
plans, don’t make so many
plans. If you’re always can-
celling plans with the same
person, be mature enough to
re-evaluate that friendship.
Don’t be a flake because
you can’t tell the difference
between an obligation
friendship and a friendship
that you’re actually gaining
something from. Be a flake
because you don’t want to
force anything or to have a
shitty time. But accept your
flakiness and cancel early,
be the best possible flake you
can be, and you don’t have to
feel guilty at all.
\\ I am someone

\\ It’s just not
socially acceptable
to say you’re a
glake – unless you
have exclusively
excellent, self-care
respecting friends,
you’re going to
come up against
some hostility if
you bail on drinks
because you just
want to be alone \\
thank you very much – but if
it means that I end up having
a rare evening to myself, I
don’t really mind that either.
Whether or not my friend has
given me a good reason or
is obviously just too lazy to
travel into Central London, it
doesn’t really matter.
Because the thing is, I cancel
plans at the last minute.
Again hear me out, I’m not a
monster – if something big is
happening and my support is
truly needed as a friend, if the
person I’m meeting is already
en route, if we have tickets to
something or we’re meeting
to do something specific and
long-planned, then I will be
there. However, sometimes
that we don’t endure this inter-
action that will be making me
increasingly tense and prob-
ably grumpy – not exactly
ideal properties in a friend.
But this is just not socially
acceptable to say. Unless you
have exclusively excellent,
self-care respecting friends,
you’re going to come up
against some hostility if you
bail on drinks because you
just want to be alone. If
you’re not being called out
to your face, you can almost
guarantee that behind the
scenes there’s some passive
aggressive bitching about
your unreliability.
If you ask anyone in strong
opposition to flaking, they will
\\ Or maybe you
just recognise that
what you really
need to do is to go
home and catch up
on some Netflix or
do whatever you
want to do, either
way you’re an adult,
and if you don’t
want to hang out
with someone, you
don’t have to \\
then, I’m not gonna, and it’s
really not a reflection of our
friendship, but a reflection of
how I am feeling right then.
Maybe it’s because you’re
overbooked that week
because you don’t like to say
no or because something
came up that’s eating into
your time. Or maybe you just
recognise that what you really
need to do is to go home and
catch up on some Netflix. Or
do some problem sheets. Or
to chat to your housemates
or to do whatever you want
to do. You’re an adult, and if
you don’t want to hang out
with someone, you don’t have
to.
Yes, you have mildly
I just want
to be
alone
Tessa! Let’s
go out!
