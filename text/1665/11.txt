irector Joe
Wright has pulled
out all the stops
for the Young
Vic’s new staging
of Bertolt Brecht’s
Life of Galileo. Under a huge
makeshift planetarium dome
actors in modern dress hurtle
around the circular stage.
Brendan Cowell as the titular
man never seems to stop, at
one moment stabbing apples
to illustrate the concept
of gravity, and the next
bodily spinning Billy Howle
playing Andrea, his pupil to
demonstrate the rotation of
the earth; he never seems
to lower his voice beyond a
mid-bellow. That it’s energetic
cannot be denied, but at times

act essential to building the
atmosphere of the produc-
tion; but in others it lends the
aura of an over-egged Brian
Cox documentary to the
proceedings.
Joe Wright, who some
years ago directed the Keira
Knightley version of Pride
and Prejudice is clearly a fan
of modernising classic stories
with modern twists (the film
doesn’t much concern itself
with staying faithful to the
period). It’s easy to see the
allure of shaking off historical
trappings to make a work
relevant. In this production,
the effect is mixed. Life of
Galileo is already a story of
an era defining discovery, it
has passion and oppression,
love and betrayal, it is a story
of revolution (both literal and
figurative); grand enough in
scope without the sexing up
that Wright seems to think is
requires.
When the action reaches
its more emotional peaks,
and the actors are left to
simply deliver the lines, it is
electrifying. Brendan Cowell
as an ailing Galileo taking
stock of his life is deeply
moving, Ayesha Antoine is
criminally under-used, but in
the brief flashes she appears
on stage in her role as the
put upon no-nonsense Mrs
Sarti, she sparkles with wit,
we don’t see much of Anjana
Vasan as Galileo’s daughter
Virginia either, but she too
gives the small character
plenty of pathos. The standout
performance is by Billy Howle
who as Galileo’s protégé
delivers a performance
that is very often funny and
occasionally deeply affecting
as he spans three decades
of the life of Andrea, from
petulant curiosity as a ten-
year-old, to uncompromising
idealism eight years later,
and finally to humility and
forgiveness as he sets out
to carry on his estranged
tutor’s work. Brecht’s work,
commonly associated with
Marxism, is fiercely political.
Like so many of the works
that found poignancy in the
80s, the focus on the dogma
of authority figures, the wilful
ignorance and suppression of
knowledge by governments
and leaders in power strikes
a chord now. Just as a little
way down the south bank at
the National Theatre, Angels
in America is about the inevi-
tability of progress, here too
in Life of Galileo the recurring
theme of the importance of
truth is both a rebuke to the
current climate of double
speak and “fake news”, and a

it gets a little too much.
The first act is almost entirely
exposition, indeed, at times
it feels uncannily like a low-fi
Royal Society Christmas
Lecture demonstration. While
it effectively establishes
Galileo as a teacher and a
scientist brimming with energy
and bombast, it drags a little
towards the end. The scenes
are intercut occasionally by
light shows on the screen
suspended like a dome above
the stage: there, vistas of
constellations and far off gal-
axies appear to a soundtrack
of seat shaking, feel-it-in-
your-bones, bass-heavy rock
music. The music has been
composed by Tom Rowlands,
one half of the Grammy-win-
ning The Chemical Brothers.

The Young Vic is always a
joy to visit, the small venue,
the proximity of the actors
and action lends immediacy
to the performances. Here,
where so much for the staging
was done to include the
audience, it was more so. Life
of Galileo tends towards the
heavy handed, but is no less
enjoyable for it. Whatever
its' shortcomings it is never
boring: laugh out loud
hilarious in places, menacing
in others, this production
thrums with energy; it is, in
trademark Wright style, pure
entertainment from start to

M
anwatching
offers an
insight into
the world
of sex from
a female
heterosexual point of view.
The show consists of a roughly
60 minute monologue, which
explores several aspects of
sex, including masturbation,
sexual fantasies and consent.
The prose is raw, explicit
and dynamically written.
In every performance the
monologue is read aloud by
a male comedian who has no
previous exposure to the text.
The result is an impromptu
experience that is funny and
at times a bit shambolic.
I went to see the piece
on its second night at the
Royal Court in Sloane
Square. I sat amongst a
diverse audience (both in
age and gender) in the
small upstairs auditorium.
The room was painted
black and on the stage
floor there were two raised
platforms housing a printer
and a jug of water. After a
few minutes a man walked
out in an expensive shirt
and shorts with a vaguely
familiar bearded face. He
announced that his name
was Adam Buxton and he
would be giving tonight’s
performance. Perhaps the
expectation was palpa-
ble; on other nights Nick
Frost and Phil Jupitius
would be performing.
Buxton addressed this
with characteristic ease,
“so I know you are all a
bit disappointed”, before
proceeding into a light
hearted biography. He is a
comedian and actor, with
an impressive portfolio of
script writing and he now
hosts a podcast. Mean-
while the printer whirred
behind him, producing the
28 page monologue. The
appearance of two yellow
pages, Buxton explained,
would mean the reading
could begin.
He started, and at once
the audience relaxed into
the rhythm of the piece. You
could tell Buxton had practice
in script reading, his pacing
was good and his phrasing
dynamic. Most importantly
he adopted the jocular tone
of the author. We could tell
it was his first time seeing
the script, and through
eyebrow raising, dramatic
pauses and what I presumed
were ad-libbed comments,
the whole experience felt
organic. There were some
stumbling points, 28 pages is

by the writer’s discursive train
of thought. Seemingly benign
anecdotes become sexualised
and the narrative jumps
between distant themes with
only the most rudimentary
segues. The fact that the nar-
rator is as surprised by this as
the audience creates a pow-
erful shared experience. We
are more prone to laughter
when we feel slightly uncom-
fortable, and the nervous
chuckles that accompanied
the first minutes reading soon
gave way to hearty roars
from the crowd.
Does it matter that the nar-
rator is a man? In many ways
it’s vital for the success of the
piece. Manwatching is after
all just that. Watching a man
react and respond to the truth
about feminine heterosexual
desire. Personally I found
some of the passages to be
genuinely enlightening. I have
no doubt that this was the
case for Buxton and the male
component of the crowd as
well. Pieces like this are not
only important because they
break down the taboo culture
of talking about sex, they also
unify the gender divide in
understanding it.
Who wrote Manwatching?
We never find out. I think it’s
important that we don’t. The
themes covered in the text
are universal and anonymity
reflects this. This is further
conveyed in the monologue’s
conclusion where women in
the audience are prompted to
stand and claim provenance
of the work. It’s in appro-
priate end to the 90 minute
reading and the applause
that follows is undoubtedly
sincere.
After the show, Buxton is
given flowers and then leaves.
We follow behind, having all
laughed and thought a good
deal. Unanimously, I think we
all feel a lot closer to Buxton
now too.

a lot to get through in one sit-
ting. Occasionally these were
funny, misread words creating
additional dirty meanings
in the text. Sometimes they
were prohibitive, and we
would have to wait as Buxton
retraced his thoughts. This
was to be expected; Buxton
handled it all very smoothly.
To help him, the monologue
could have been made
shorter, and perhaps some
of the awkward phrasing
smoothed to make it more
first-read friendly.
It’s important I do not give
too much away regarding the
content of the monologue.
Part of the fun in this piece is
being shocked and surprised
