Election hustings to take place at Imperial
Lef Apostolakis
I
mperial will be hosting
general election hustings
on the 1st
of June,
inviting five speakers
representing the
Conservatives, Labour,
UKIP, Lib Dems and Greens.
Speakers were selected by
picking the constituencies
in which the most Imperial
students live (Hammersmith,
Kensington and the Cities of
London and Westminster).
“I approached the PPCs
from the parties one by one
initially, and was successful
in getting interest early on
from local Lib Dem, Green
and Labour,” says third-year
chemist, Michael Edwards
who’s been organising the
hustings. “UKIP and the
Conservatives proved more
tricky to pin down. I initially
had my sights on sitting MPs,
such as Andy Slaughter in
Hammersmith, but what with
the short term announcement
of this election, most people
still had engagements, so it
was a struggle.”
Edwards and his team
have been polling students
to find out what main issues
embers of Imperial have on
their minds. Burning questions
unsurprisingly involve issues
on the NHS, Higher Education,
and Brexit. However we
should expect a discussion on
a range of topics including the
economy and job prospects,
climate policy, the ‘Snoopers’
charter, research funding,
immigration and the housing
crisis.
The plan is for the event to
take the format of Question
Time, wherein audience
members suggest questions
before going in, and one
of the chairs presents those
questions to the panel.
Organisers are still waiting
on clearance for some
speakers, though the ones who
have been cleared have come
back with a minimal security
warning. It’s safe to assume
campus will be kept breezy,
with likelihood of protesters at
a minimum.
The debate will hopefully
offer the chance to Imperial
students to be exposed to
their potential democratic
representatives. “Although not
all of the panel may end up
with a seat in the Commons,”
says Edwards, “some of them
are local councillors for wards
with a significant student
population, and getting them
to come to campus to talk with
students is beneficial for both
students and politicians.”
I’ve been talking to people
who are considering not
voting as, due to the nature
of the FPTP system, their vote
won’t count in either their
home or uni constituency, and
being exposed to the people
battling for your vote can
change mindsets.”
If nothing else, Edwards
hopes that meaningful
exposure to students will make
politicians think more about
how they can pass policy that
benefits us as both current
students and future taxpayers.
Nas Andriopoulos who
will most likely be chairing
the event said “the London
Forum for Science and Policy
have asked me to chair the
event and I look forward to
putting students’ questions to
the panel. I would encourage
voters to come along, as it will
be the perfect opportunity
for our members to quiz local
party representatives on
how their policies will affect
students, STEMM in general as
well as wider socioeconomic
issues. “
This year I have been
apolitical and will continue to
do so, I will be merely keeping
the peace during debate
and asking the students’
questions.”

Mental health related drop-outs on the rise
Lef Apostolakis
I
n only five years, the
number of students who
have dropped out from
higher education has
quadrupled according
to data from the Higher
Education Statistics Agency
(HESA). The findings which
were highlighted earlier last
week by the Guardian, show
that just in 2014-15 a record
1,180 students struggling
with mental health left higher
education.
A series of freedom of
information requests by the
Guardian which managed
to collect data from over 90
universities echoed these
reports. The investigation
found that just during the
academic year of 2015-
16, nearly 88,000 students
requested counselling, up
28% from the previous year
and this demand is only
increasing.
It’s unclear whether this
trend reflects an increase
in the occurrence of mental
health problems amongst
university students or whether
it’s a result of the fight against
mental health stigmas, the rise
in awareness of the existence
of mental health services or
trends of over-medicalisation.
At Cardiff University for
example, the demand for
counselling services which
rose by 96% in the last three
years is believed to be down
to the institution’s campaign to
encourage students to access
support. At least according to
Ben Lewis, director of student
support and wellbeing.
At Imperial according to a
2015 student survey, 20%
of students reported a mental
illness diagnosis, with a further
40% believing they didn’t
have a mental illness but
having experienced mental
stresses anyway.
Available services here
include the Student Mental
Health Advisers (SMHA)
but to see one students need
to be referred by a staff
member. Following a referral,
the long wait for a suitable
appointment begins. There is
no indication of how long this
takes on average but many
students reportedly have to
wait weeks before receiving
an appointment, during
which time their condition
can rapidly deteriorate with
dangerous effects.
In response a pilot scheme
was launched at the start of
the 2015-2016 academic year,
offering the option of over-
email counselling. Students
the referral process is easier (it
involves filling in a registration
form and questionnaire) and
if successful leads to an initial
four email exchanges with a
counsellor. Still the service has
it’s limitations, including the
depth of information that can
be conveyed in an email.
With overstretched and
unresponsive mental health
services combined with an
increase in the number of
anxiety sources, dropping
out of university might be the
fastest and best way to cope
with mental stress.

It’s easier to drop out than find support
