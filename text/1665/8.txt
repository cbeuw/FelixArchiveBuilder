Are we
medicalising
personality?
Tessa Davey thinks sometimes we cross
the line when it comes to diagnosing
mental health disorders vs personality
traits.
N
one of my
friends from
home have
mental health
p r o b l e m s .
This is in small-
town, rural Wales, where
knowing about the wider
world isn't really a thing, and
buzzwords like self-care and
mindfulness might as well be in
a totally different language, or
are laughed at from behind a
veneer of defiant stoicism. This
isn't to say that some people
in my hometown don’t suffer
like my friends in London, but
certainly more of them claim
to be happy. Maybe it’s the
country way of life, or maybe

experiencing and help us
find guidance and ways to
cope. But there comes a point
where these descriptions
become our whole identity, we
become nothing more than a
collection of precisely defined
traits. When these are our
defining features, rather than
simply being aspects of our
personality, we can lose track
of who we are and use them
as excuses to inhibit ourselves.
There is scientific evidence
that acting happy can raise
your mood and adjust your
brain chemistry. There is
also evidence to suggest
that thinking you should be
miserable can make you sad.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not
for a second suggesting that
those who truly are suffering
from medically diagnosable
mental health problems or
social issues that affect their
quality of life are doing
anything wrong by identifying
these issues but some people
hide behind them, which can
have a negative impact.
Instead of just calling
themselves a bit shy, people
are jumping on the Youtuber-
backed trend of self-diagnosis,
claiming social anxiety for
example and using that as an
excuse for avoiding things that
they actually like to do. This
isn’t everyone – a lot of people
use it as a starting point to find
tools to work on things they
want to change, but for others
it justifies a complacency.
When we force our
personality into boxes, we
are sometimes forced into
manufacturing problems.
As soon as we’ve found a
problem, we can then fall into
our personality traits? When
we do that we are implicitly
saying that the perfect person
is one without any of these
‘problems’: a person without
personality.
Awareness of mental health
problems and removal of the
stigma that surrounds them is
hugely important, and I fully
support the huge societal
drive to work on these things.
But some of the things we’re
diagnosing aren’t problems,
they’re just traits. It’s the same
when we look at all disabilities
as illnesses in need of a
cure rather than features of
people that makes them who
they are: it’s alienating and
dehumanising.
Given that so much mental
health research is done by
pharmaceutical companies
trying to flog you mood
adjusting drugs, does it
not seem a bit sinister that
we’re rushing to medicalise
normalcy? It’s now normal to
be diagnosed with depression
following a bereavement,
where in the past it would
have been a given that you
were grieving. If a diagnosis
helps you get support, then
I’m all for it, but all too often it
makes people think that there
is something wrong with them,
and it starts an endless cycle
of depression that can be hard
to break.
It's really important to be
able to recognise and talk
about problems that we are
experiencing, and familiarity
\\ As soon as we’ve
found a problem,

it's the lack of awareness
that all too often leads to
self-diagnosis and, like a self-
fulfilling prophecy, misery.
Does the hyperawareness
of issues like social anxiety
and mental health problems
help diagnose and give us
the vocabulary to discuss our
issues, or does it merely serve
to overmedicalise personality
– something that in turn makes
people unhappy?
Having words to describe
ourselves can give us an
identity. It can help us
easily share what we are

this cycle of being unhappy
because we think we should
be. Sometimes ignorance is
bliss, and an undiagnosed
personality disorder is just a
quirk.
You’d be hard pressed to
find anyone who you couldn’t
diagnose with some sort of
personality disorder. You want
a citation for that? – There are
plenty in the medical literature.
But why do we do need to?
How is it helpful to diagnose
and compartmentalise all of
with the vocabulary to do so
is an important first step. But
in a world where the numbers
of people who claim to be
suffering increases with the
numbers of words we have
for a problem, we should be
cautious in applying these
definitions to ourselves. Self-
improvement is always a good
thing, but sometimes instead
of looking to cure ourselves
from the pathology of
personality, we should accept
our individual differences and
celebrate them.
