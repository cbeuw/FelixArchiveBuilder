CANCER
VIRGO
This week you
try being a Yes
Person, saying yes
to everything you
get offered. You end
up with gonorrhoea
and a pet snake you
decide to call Magic
Mike. Yay?

This week you are
told your boyfriend of
three years was just
“really good friends”
with you and just
happened to sleep
with you five nights a
week. #SummerLuvin
This week you
accidentally order
Coke instead of diet
Coke and realise they
taste exactly the same.
You feel like a dick
briefly and get over it.
This week you get
threatened with legal
action if you’re to
publish that thing
you’re not allowed
to publish because
people are OK with
dicks on the front cover
but not with making
fun of scientists.
This week your
housemate walks in
and yells: “I JUST LOST
MY VIRGINITY TO AN
ICE CREAM TRUCK!”
You can’t wait to
move out.
This week you’re
Jonathan Masters
and your alter ego
has taken over your
body and tries to do a
murder suicide on you.
Sadly you don’t have
any kitchen knives at
your house because
they glorify violence.
This week you’re a
security guard. You’re
disappointed you haven’t
received any gifts. The
Provost lied about an
increase in security
presents.
This week you’re a
bunch of school-kids
running about on
Queen’s Lawn. You
don’t even go here.
This week you’re
Imperial’s legal
team and you’re
disappointed felix
would make fun of the
President’s awards.
It’s like they don’t even
read the paper.
This week you are
a random man in
the Union Bar and,
after finishing your
mozzarella sticks,
you fill the dish with
ketchup and sneak off
with it. Who are you?
What are you doing?
This week you feel hotter
than you’ve ever felt
before. Maybe it’s that
avocado-toast. Maybe it’s
Maybelline. Oh wait no it’s
the Central Library.
This week you spend
all your time on Trip
Advisor looking for
sweet travel deals, at
the expense of your
degree. You fail your
final exam but at least
you bagged some
dirt cheap tickets to
Morocco.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m a first year Chemist and while everyone’s out and about
enjoying the sun, my looming end-of-term exams cast their
shadow on me and are seeping off all my joy.
All I feel is an impending sense of doom, whether that’s
when I stand in line waiting to get served at the library cafe
or trying to enjoy a friendly game of ultimate Frisbee.
I’ve tried kick-starting my revision but I either get tempted
by the lovely weather and get dragged outdoors by my
friends, or if I somehow muster the willpower to stay home I
have to deal with everyone at halls who’s finished exams and
is flaunting their care-free lifestyle without respect or empathy
for the rest of us who still have shit to pass.
How do I deal with this?
Carrie Less
Dear sweet innocent fresher Carrie,
We’ve all been there. How can anyone
be expected to work and study when it’s
30 degrees outside and even hotter in the
library? It is a known fact that no serious work
gets done after the 15th
of May. So technically
if you still have exams to revise for or if you
haven’t completed your final year project, I’m
sorry my dear but you’re up for elimination.
You might be asking yourself “But why did
nobody tell ME?” Honey, Imperial is a dog-
eat-dog world. For every student that fails, the
future becomes a tiny bit less hopeless and
uncertain for the countless PhDs and postdocs
with dreams of tenure.
But to be fair no one tells first years anything
and that’s OK be because your year counts
for peanuts in comparison to the rest of your
HOROSCOPES
time here at College. I’d really recommend
a couple chill pills. Just go out have fun, pass
ideally and it should be fine.
“BUT GRADES!”
*Sigh* If you really need to get that 2:1,
there’s only one solution – Central Library
camp out. Pack your snacks, pack your toiletry
bag (which should include toilet roll and an
enema kit just in case) and bring that USB fan
your friends got you as a joke three Secret
Santas ago cause things are about to get
steamy. Literally.
But seriously chill, you’re just a baby. Come
back when you have a 150 page thesis to
write.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
