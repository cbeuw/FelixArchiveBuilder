government, let's take a
moment to think about
the fallout for the political
landscape of the future.
Leaving aside the speculations
as to the potential success
of Mrs. May as future PM,
consider what will be left
wilting on the opposite
benches of the House: a
decrepit, highly unconvincing,
and functionally incapable
opposition. If we're lucky,
and the gods of political
amusement are smiling upon
us, this could be spearheaded
by Tim Farron, backed mightily
by his four fellow Lib Dem MPs,
but, then again, we might see
him pipped to the post by the
fish finger running against him
in his constituency (true story).
What is inevitable, however, is
that whatever opposition we
may have in the Commons,
it will be an embarrassment,
which will negatively affect all
voters, whether the blood that
runs in their veins is blue, red,
orange or green.
The ridiculously low bar
set by Comrade Corbyn and
Co. of the past two years has
been, inexplicably, undercut
in the weeks running up to
the election. Now, I don't
especially lament over a
Conservative victory, but the
fact that they don't have to
make any real arguments in
this campaign, and are able to
sit back and watch the other
parties implode, is a little

depressing.
Just look at the quality of
opposition in this campaign. As
I'm writing, the Conservative
party has just released their
Manifesto, and the customary
replies from major opposing
Party members have come out.
To say that their arguments
were weak would be an
understatement; their attempts
at genuine political discussion
couldn't support a matchstick.
first place. Adding a 2.5%
clause isn't generous, it's just
silly. You don't need a higher
income per year if prices stay
the same – a change that
is measured precisely and
regularly by inflation rates.
The Winter Fuel Allowance is
being scrapped only for those
pensioners wealthy enough
to pay for their own fuel –
something Labour havebeen
clamouring should happen for
years. As for social care, the
Tories are raising the amount
of money that you can keep
whilst still being eligible for
free care – thus extending
the number of people who
won't have to sell their home
or raid their pension pots to
pay for it. Not a single one
of those 'opposing' arguments
is logical, supported by fact,
or even reflects the official
Labour Party policy.
Though there are some
genuine political discussions
to be had in support Labour’s
foundations, instead of
making these, Corbyn is
desperately trying to throw
mud at Mrs. May, but seems
to fail even at that. His total
lack of ability as a political
opponent might be good for
Mrs. May, but it isn't good
for the governmental process
of the United Kingdom, and
it isn't good for you and me.
We need politicians to hold
each other to account, and a
framework where the attempts
to do so are almost comical
doesn't help anyone.
The Lib Dems are even worse,
not that that's any surprise.
Instead of looking at the
serious issue of the European
Union, a key policy divide
to which they are offering a
genuine political alternative,
they decided instead on this:
"Theresa May is betraying
working families by snatching
school lunches from their
children and their homes when
they die."
Dear oh dear. Not only does
this patronisingly, and very
unconvincingly, try to wield the
great trigger words – 'working
families' – but it is just factually
incorrect. Under current rules,
the elderly have to sell their
assets, including a long term
family home, to pay for care.
Under the Tory proposals, not
only would they be able to live
the rest of their lives at home,
but they could keep more
money to give to their family
at the end of it.
As for the school meals
the Conservatives have
pledged to increase education
spending, a measure funded
by scrapping free school
meals for all pupils. The Lib
Dems have promised the same
increased expenditure on
education, but, as yet, haven't
explained how they'd pay for
it – perhaps they figured that
they're not getting in anyway,
so who needs a reasonable
financial approach? I don't
care much for the Conservative
policies on social spending,
but I am not going to publicly
debase myself, as the Lib
Dems have done, by lying for
no other reason than to make
headlines and glumly shake
my head on TV.
The Lib Dems should be
touting the honest political
dialogue that they bring to the
table, and extolling the other,
valid political opinions they
have, instead of the frantic
name-calling and flag-waving
in which they're engaging.
I honestly believe that all
political parties have good
arguments, appeal to sensible
votingpeopleindifferentways,
and play a vital role in the
democratic landscape of our
nation. In the current political
environment, however, parties
are wandering aimless in a
sea of meaningless soundbites
and thinly veiled stupidity; it is
a sorry sight.
In the Lord of the Rings,
a powerful female ruler,
Galadriel, mulls over what her
potentialfuturewouldlooklike,
if she takes the Ring of power
and becomes a supreme,
monarchical figure. Although
she heroically denies the
opportunity, in her pondering
she declares that, if she ruled
as such, "All shall love me
and despair". I think a similar
analogy might be applicable
to the current election. Mrs
May might rule with a great
majority, but we the people,
although supporting her
leadership, might forlornly
look at the broken pieces of
our democratic process left
lying in the ashes of a decent
opposition.

Take Labour: "She is hitting
older people with a classic
nasty party triple whammy:
Scrapping the triple lock on
pensions, removing the Winter
Fuel Allowance and forcing
those who need social care to
pay for it with their homes."
Even someone with Corbyn's
level of education should be
able to see how dishonest –
perhaps even stupid – those
claims are. The triple lock on
pensions is being replaced
with a guarantee to increase
state pensions by the higher
of either inflation or the rise
in wages, the only reason that
they need to be raised in the
