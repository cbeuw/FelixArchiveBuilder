Engineering dominates Imperial awards
SACAs, President’s Awards and NSS scores all say the same thing
Lef Apostolakis
T
he Union honoured
Imperial staff
last week at the
annual Student
Academic Choice
Awards (SACAs
for short) after sifting through
a record breaking 831
nominations. The ceremony
saw eight humans of Imperial
getting recognised for their
contributions in teaching.
Categories include
supervision, tutoring, teaching
assistant, undergraduate
and postgraduate teaching,
feedback, innovation and
support.
Though Imperial has a
long history of honouring
members of its community for
their teaching and research,
the President’s Awards (and
formerly the Rector’s Awards)
with their selection panels
overseen by the Provosts
lack significant student
involvement.
SACAs, on the other hand,
give students the opportunity
to be involved in the process
of shortlisting nominations
by acting as panel members
and/or panel chairs. This
means that shortlisted staff
have been nominated and
shortlisted by students.
According to Deputy
President (Education), Luke
McCrone, this makes the
SACAs extremely valuable.
“It is a widely held belief that
the repository of data we
generate through SACAs is
about the best indication of
‘teaching quality/excellence’
that we can get our hands
on – the direct, untampered
views of our students who
voluntarily come forward to
speak out about best practise,”
says McCrone. “This data will
inevitably lay the necessary
foundation from which we
can innovate educationally
in future, including as part of
the Learning and Teaching
strategy.”
Looking at the outcomes of
theSACAs,aproblemthatVice
Provost for Education, Simone
Buitendijk has repeatedly
expressed becomes evident –
the student experience varies
widely across faculties and
departments. This year for
example, while most awards
were given to members of
the faculty of engineering,
the faculty of natural sciences
managed to snag a couple
and the faculty of medicine
also took home one (the
department of bioengineering
was the only department to
bag two awards).
However, the faculty of
engineering has consistently
dominated the awards. Since
their establishment in 2012,
members of the faculty have
received over half of all
awards. Out of the 40 SACAs
awarded over the last five
years, only a quarter of all
SACAs have been awarded
to natural scientists while
members from the department
of medicine have only received
six. The Business School and
the Centre for Languages,
Culture and Communication
(home to Horizons and the
Science Communication Unit)
have only taken an award
home once so far (which,
considering their size, is quite
an achievement).
To an extent this is to
be expected. 45% of all
students at Imperial are
engineering students, whereas
approximately a third and a
quarter are natural scientists
and medics respectively.
However, the award
distribution also reflects
the NSS results. With the
exception of the department of
mathematics, natural sciences
and medicine typically
perform poorly at the NSS
survey. The crux of Imperial
seems to be assessment and
feedback with just over 40%
of physicists last year agreeing
that they were happy with the
quality of assessment and
feedback they received.
Though numerous voices
at Imperial have repeatedly
expressed that NSS scores
are not the be-all and end-all,
the dissatisfaction they reveal
seems to come up at every
opportunity.
In the case of the President’s
Awards too, distinctions are
disproportionately awarded
to members of the Faculty of
Engineering.
In Education, excellence is
recognised across teaching,
pastoral care, research
supervision and support
of the student experience.
Twenty staff members
were recognised across all
categories with over half of
them occupying roles within
the Faculty of Engineering.
Another 16 awards were
given for research. Engineers
dominated again, gathering
nine distinctions, whereas the
faculties of Natural Sciences
and Medicine took home
four distinctions each (one
distinction was joint between
faculties).
Looking at the winners lists
available online, it is evident
that this is a consistent pattern.
Both in 2016 and 2015,
engineers received half or
more of all awards.

Physics flops in league tables
Oh how the mighty have fallen. NOT Joanna Wormald
I
mperial is regularly
declared one of the best
universities in the world.
The latest Guardian
university league tables
reaffirms this, placing
us in joint 6th
place overall.
Imperial ranked top in Earth
and Marine Sciences, Civil
Engineering, Electronic and
Electrical Engineering, and
Engineering (general).
Physics however was a
different story. Last year,
Physics retained its place in 8th
position. The 2018 rankings
see it plummet to 30th.
Why have we fallen so far so
fast? Statistics provided by the
Guardian over the past three
years don’t make for happy
reading. The overall score
awarded to Imperial fell from
86.3 out of 100 in 2017 to a
lowly 57.2 this year. Scores
are calculated from a range
of metrics, largely taken from
the National Student Survey
(NSS), which measure not
only what benefits graduates
gain but also how much the
university puts into the course.
The Department of
Physics has maintained
\\ We certainly
don’t think this drop
in rankings is a true
reflection of the
quality of the
course \\
expenditure per student and
the student:staff ratio has
remained reasonably steady
at 11.0. Yet overall satisfaction
has dropped for the second
year in a row, from 86% in
2017 to just 68% this year. This
seems more an effect of exams
and coursework (assessment
satisfaction has dropped 20
percentage points to 42%)
and less a result of poor
teaching quality — teaching
satisfaction is only down seven
percentage points at 82%.
Strong teaching may be
why achieving a 1st
or 2:1
is considered slightly easier
now. That’s according to
the ‘value-added’ score,
which has fallen to 4/10.
This piece of “sophisticated
indexing methodology”
measures how difficult it is
for students to graduate with
good degrees based on their
entry qualifications. A low
value-added score indicates
it is easier to get that all-
essential 2:1 or above. It’s
unclear whether this year’s
lower score is a positive or
negative thing — a higher
number of students achieving
a good degree could have a
devaluing effect. Concerns
among students that their
degree might be perceived
as worth less are mitigated
by doubts that employers
have sufficient knowledge
to compare the difficulty of
completing a Physics degree
at different institutions.
Currently the Guardian
league table indicates 85%
of physicists find graduate-
level work or further study
after six months. Yet students
remain optimistic, hoping the
transferable skills they gain
will be viewed well and boost
their career prospects.
Whether the results are fair
or accurate is a different story.
“It strikes me that [the rankings]
are more a measure of how
much students enjoyed the
course rather than how good
the course is academically,”
says first-year Cameron
Hughes, though he adds
that “generally satisfaction
isn’t great, particularly for
feedback.”
What about College’s own
league table analysis? It
is keen to note that unlike
other domestic league tables,
the Guardian dismisses
research-related metrics
as unimportant. Imperial
disagrees, implying we
would rank higher had these
measurements been included.
In the spirit of intercollegiate
rivalry, the analysis highlights
where Imperial has beaten
Cambridge, Oxford and UCL.
What it neglects to mention
is UCL didn’t just rank more
highly than Imperial in Physics
— they replaced us at 8th
position. Talk about adding
insult to injury.
Speaking to Professor
Jordan Nash, Head of the
Department of Physics, it
seems the rankings weren’t
a surprise. NSS results have
been available from the start
of the year and a rankings
drop was anticipated.
“We have been changing
how our course is delivered,”
Professor Nash explained.
These changes in response
to previous student feedback
mean last year’s cohort were
probably subject to more
disruption than other years.
The department has “taken
very seriously the results
of the NSS last year” and
been working to implement
changes based on “a number
of complaints where [the
Department of Physics]
certainly agree we can do
things better.”
The department has
examined complaints and
identified improvement areas,
such as demonstrations and
feedback in labs and tutorials.
Students say “it feels like
our lab reports are marked
fairly haphazardly.” Students
receive different marks
despite writing similar things
to their peers and receive
contradictory advice. For
example, students told to use
Harvard referencing in their
next lab report were informed
they should actually have
used Vancouver referencing.
To remedy this, further training
will be provided to members
of staff involved in labs and
tutorials.
Another source of
unhappiness was “a small
number of errors in exam
scripts.” Changes are now
being made to the way in
which exams are prepared
and checked to reduce future
errors.
Additionally, extra staff have
been taken on to assist with
undergraduate administration
issues. This includes a new
Student Liaison Officer to
better support students.
It is not expected the league
tables will adversely affect the
number of future applicants.
There are many other rankings
available, all drawn from
different data. Imperial ranks
very highly in most of these,
including on career prospects
and the “scientific excellence
of the staff”, which are often
important considerations of
prospective candidates.
Professor Nash assures
us that “as a department
we certainly don’t think this
drop in rankings is a true
reflection of the quality of
the course we offer, and in
talking to our students I also
get the impression they don’t
feel so negatively about the
department.” He is confident
results will improve. Next year
may see Imperial reclaim its
position towards the top of the
table.
