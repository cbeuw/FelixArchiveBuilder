Central Library air-con cost £11m College
increases
security in
wake of
Manchester
attack
The Central Library spent more money in 2017
than it has over the last ten years

n a statement sent out by
President Alice Gast and
Provost James Stirling,
Imperial students and
staff were told that there
will now be an increased
presence of security at
College’s campuses.
This announcement comes
two days after 22 people
were killed and dozens were
injured at an Ariana Grande
concert at the Manchester
Arena. Another eight have
been confirmed missing.
On Wednesday soldiers
were put on guard outside
Buckingham Palace and
Downing Street after Theresa
May said another attack may
be “imminent”.
Although the President and
the Provost reassured members
of Imperial that there is no
reason to suspect any specific
threat to our institution or other
universities, it also warned the
Imperial community “to remain
vigilant and to immediately
report anything suspicious to
Security”.
A College spokesperson
said new security measures
will include “increasing both
the number of patrols and the
number of officers stationed
in public areas around the
campuses. We are also
working closely with our
neighbours to enhance safety
and security in the surrounding
areas as well as on campus.”
College urges students
who have been affected to
contact their personal tutors,
supervisors, senior tutors or
the College tutors at any point.
For staff, free confidential help
is available from Confidential
Care 24 hours a day, by
telephone (0800 085 4764)
or online.

I
t might have taken a
freedom of information
request but we found
out how much the new
Central Library air-con is
going to cost. And while
we were at it we thought we’d
ask for the cost of every single
refurbishment the Library
has undergone since 2004.
Because nobody keeps secrets
from felix (and also because
College is only requested by
law to keep data for up to 12
years).
Starting from the top. The
Library’s single biggest
expense still on record is the
Central Library Reimaging,
which will see the Installation
of “chillers” on the roof and
might help reduce face-melting
temperatures. But we already
knew it cost a fortune (£11
million to be precise) since it
took a decade of complaints,
plummeting NSS scores and
Brexit for College to commit
to improving the single most
used space on campus.
This is the Central Library’s
single largest expenditure in
recent recorded history. The
attempt to please overheating
students is costing more than
all refurbishments the Central
Library has undergone over
the last decade.
The second and third
most notable ‘Treat Yo Self’
moment in recent memory
were (collectively) the 2008
refurbishments which cost
£10.4 million.
The ground floor, which
back in the day housed a
Waterstones (oh yes) and the
Science Museum Library, was
merged into the old walkway
and became the Library Cafe
and the group study area
dotted with cosy think tanks.
The Haldane Collection (also
known as the Humanities
collection of the Central
Library) which used to sit in
the north side of the library
was evicted and replaced by
the Wolfson IT Learning Suite
(prime napping spot).
This project also marks the
beginning of the “air-con
curse”. The dimensions of
the rooms which were meant
to house the ground floor
air conditioning units were
different to the ones in the
original plans. As the units
are built according to the
specifications of the room
they’re housed in, considering
the specs meant the Library
re-opening was pushed back
three months to July, after
summer exams. To avoid
drilling noises revising students
were at the time advised to
study at higher levels, which
however had started reaching
intolerable temperatures. All
in all not much has changed
since 2008.
The fourth splurgiest
moment since the Athens
Olympics was the 2015 Level
2 Development which saw the
Science Museum library being
once again evicted and the
creation of additional student
study spaces on Level 3. This
cost £350,000.
Finally, last place on our Top
Five and personal favourite
(in fact the main reason
behind this FOI) Is the Library
Main Entrance Vestibule
(commonly referred to as “the
fucking Library doors”). The
foyer enclosing the Central
Library’s main entrance was
constructedinjustoveramonth
and was meant to Improve
climate control and conserve
energy. It’s unclear whether
it’s achieved these goals,
but it’s certainly increased
student frustration and might
even have something to do
with the mental health crisis
facing higher education. We
are finally proud to reveal that
the Library doors outside the
Library doors cost £143,000.
Other notable expenditures
include two decoration
projects (one in 2008 and one
in 2013) which cumulatively
cost £18,000 and £192,000
flushed down the toilets. Oh
and wind catchers worth
£75,000 in 2004, but even
our Millennials editor, Tessa
Davey, who’s been at Imperial
for almost a decade wasn’t
around back then to tell us if
they successfully cooled down
the Library, so I guess we’ll
never know.
And now that you know
how much that snazzy study
space we call home has cost,
stop trying to smuggle in pot
noodles.
“Wait. How much did library doors cost?!” \\ felix
Mentality launches new survey
T
wo years after its
launch, Mentality is
conducting another
survey to gain
insight into stress
andmentalhealthat
Imperial. The survey will close
at the end of June, with results
expected to be published by
the end of term. According
to Mentality chair Ariana
Sadr-Hashemi, the previous
report focused on getting
Imperial-specific statistics on
what mental health issues are
most prominent in the student
body and measuring general
attitudes to mental health.
“This survey is more
campaign-oriented, aimed
at finding out in detail what
students use what mental
health services, both college
and NHS ones, and what their
experiences were so we can
campaign for improvements,”
says Sadr-Hashemi.
The survey will also
investigate whether there has
been a significant change
if any, in the prevalence of
mental health issues within the
student body since 2015.
The initial survey which
was conducted in 2015
resulted in a report with
several key findings and
recommendations. According
to Mentality, 20% of
respondents at the time stated
that they had been diagnosed
with a mental illness, and a
further 40% of respondents
felt that they didn’t have
a mental illness but had
experienced mental stresses.
In addition, 69.5% of Imperial
students surveyed reported
feeling stressed at least once
a week. In comparison an
NUS wide study reported
31% of respondents feeling
the same way. The report
also highlighted the key role
of academic pressure in the
propagation of stress.
This time the survey hopes
to reveal what services
people use to get support and
their positive and negative
experiences with each
individual service. Mentality
are hoping this will shed more
light on what needs to be
campaigned for and where
most of the focus needs to go.
A link to the survey can be
found on the Union website.
EEE Library to close at the end of term
Lef Apostolakis
T
he Electrical
and Electronic
E n g i n e e r i n g
library, one of
only a handful
of departmental
libraries remaining in the
South Ken Campus, will
be turned into a study
space over the course of
the summer. Departmental
Facilities Manager for the
EEE department, Andy Paice
told felix that following
consultations with the students
and as part of a larger
development taking place at
the EEE building the teaching
office will be moving where
the EEE library currently
resides, and the vacant space
will be turned into a study
area.
According to Angela
Goldfinch, EEE liaison
librarian departmental
libraries were gradually
absorbed into Central Library
over a prolonged period of
time. Library spaces within the
Faculty of Engineering were
closed/redeveloped back in
2009 with the agreement of
the Faculty. Where agreed,
physicalstock(books,journals,
etc) was absorbed into the
Central Library collection and
subject support staff moved
into Central Library (but were
still accessible to students
and staff). The departments
then redeveloped the spaces
including the provision of
student study space.
In the case of Electrical
and Electronic Engineering,
the Department opted to
retain the Library stock as a
reference collection for staff/
researchers.Theyredeveloped
the space to provide study
areas for taught students,
and also for staff/researchers
(restricted access). The space
is still called the Electrical and
Electronic Engineering Library
but is more a study space
rather than a working library
and is a department space.
As Paice puts it “the actual
library closed six years ago.”
Paice says no one is taking any
books out and when student
representatives were asked
whether the library should
be kept as, is they declined,
opting for a new and improved
study space instead.
The last departmental library
on the South Kensington
campus belongs to Civil
Engineering. The Department
took over management of the
existing library (retaining their
stock) and so provides an
additional library facility to
their staff and students (which
