Afterhours sessions in the Central Library
H
ow does one end up in the Library past midnight? Maybe you had
a paper to submit tomorrow. You thought you had everything under
control. You were halfway there but you made the mistake of taking
a break and committing to an episode of the Great British Bake Off.
Six hours later you get a text from your coursemate asking you what
reference you used for a thing you haven’t even heard of. You look
at the time and have a mini heart episode. You get up from the sofa, the sudden
movement giving you head-rush, take a deep breath and make the only decision
that makes sense at 1 a.m. on a Thursday. You go to the Central Library.
We’ve all been there. Some of us more than once. Frankly if you haven’t
pulled an all-nighter in the library do you even go here? Still the Central Library
gets transformed into a magical realm, littered with candy wrappers, popu-
lated by orphan lecture notes. If you keep still you might get approached by a
sleep-deprived undergrad, desperately looking for a functioning toilet. Who are
these study-machines who power the Central Library’s afterhours sessions? Are
they victims of circumstance? Are they bad time-managers? Are they the overly
keen, the serial night owls, the best people you will ever know? How do they do
it and what wisdom do they have to impart on us? We decided to find out and
reveal their secrets.
We arrived at our destination just after twelve. As any seasoned Imperial student
will know, at eleven all College study spaces shut and students are thrown out of
their departments, leaving the desperate with only one option: the Central Library.
By twelve, everyone has settled in, got their snacks spread out, had a little cry
maybe and is probably three chapters deep in revision. Clearly that’s the best time
to be interrupted.
We started with the ground
floor and made our way up.
We’d start with the group
study areas and build our
confidence up until we
reached the silent study
floors.
The first guy we bumped
into was Andy Whitfield, a
Metals and Energy Finance
Masters student who was
surprisingly chatty.
Why are you not home
working?
I concentrate better here. It
forces me to work – there
are too many distractions at
home.
What is your relationship with
the library?
I hate it, it’s a terrible place!
No, it’s a good facility really.
I’d just rather be somewhere
else: asleep right now.
What is the longest amount of
time you have ever spent in
the library?
Probably twelve hours.
How do you get through it?
Music, or I go out on my bike
and ride around London for
half an hour and wake up a
bit.
What about snacks and
drinks?
Mini cheddars and I don’t
really drink coffee although
I did bring pro plus with me
today but I haven’t had it yet.
What sort of person do you
think you have to be to come
here for an all-nighter?
There are some who just
come here for fun and enjoy
it. One guy on my course
just enjoys working in the
middle of the night. He would
rather sleep all day and work
through the night.
That’s not me – this is just a
last minute thing.
Let’s talk hygiene. Tell us
about the toilers.
They’re fucking horrible in
Imperial. I don’t know what’s
wrong with this place. I’ve
spent four years in central
Africa working on a mine and
the toilets there were better
than the ones at Imperial.
How would you describe
yourself?
Laid-back. Too laid-back
apparently as I left this all to
the last minute.
We thanked Andy and
wished him good luck. We
said we’d come back to check
up on him. We lied.
Next we cornered someone
on his way back to his group.
He didn’t see us coming.
Actually he did and was
really cool about sparing
five minutes to talk to us. But
we managed to mess up the
recording so we’ll never know
what this beautiful stranger
had to say.
We then decided we should
probably move on and harass
people on other floors. But
not before intruding the
privacy of one of those weird
little study cubes and force
Shafakat Bashir, a Chemical
Engineering Masters student
to talk to us
Is this your first all-nighter?
It’s not my first no. I can’t
revise during the day as there
is no space in the library. So
I sleep during the day and
revise all night.
How many all-nighters have
you done?
Loads. Even when I’m not
revising I’d come in the
morning at about five o’clock
just before lectures and do six
hours – do my lectures and
then go home. During the day
there is too much distraction
and the library is quite busy
as well. It’s always hot. At this
time you can revise at your
own pace and it’s quiet – and
it all goes in.
Is there any sort of routine
you have when you revise?
If I understand something and
I’m just practicing something
then I listen to music. If I don’t
then it’s a distraction.
You’ve got a very large bottle
of water there but do you
ever have any other drinks or
snacks?
No, if I have sugar I feel
sleepy and go home. So, I
stay away from sugar and
foods. I just have the big
bottle of water. It goes, it lasts
me the night. I don’t do any
refills – I can’t drink London
water, I’m from Leeds.
How much do you spend on
bottled water a year?
This bottle is 50 pence and I
have two bottles a day proba-
bly. About £7 a week. When
you think about it it’s quite a
bit.
What about toilets and
hygiene?
They have their ups and
downs. Lately, the toilets in
the library have been out of
order. There’s always been
stuff clogged in the toilets and
shit around the bowl – it's
kind of off-putting.
What kind of person do you
think you need to be to do
all-nighters in the library?
What kind of person are you?
Because I’ve moved here
from a different part of the
country and don’t really know
anyone where I live the only
social aspect of my life is at
university. If you’ve got a very
social and active life, it’s a bit
more difficult to do all-night-
ers. If you’re living secluded
away from student areas
it’s a bit more dull – you’re
a lot more likely to study,
especially at this time. If it's a
Thursday, Friday or Saturday
night and you’re a student
and you wanna get wrecked
you’re not going to come to
the library.
After wasting a good fifteen
minutes of Shafakat’s time we
reluctantly decided to let him
go back to his big old bottle
of water and make our way
to the second floor to tackle a
silent study area.
We tried talking to a good
six or seven students on the
second floor. Luckily Fabiola
Mann, a first year medic, took
pity on us before we lost all
our remaining morale.
How many all-nighters have
you done?
Not that many, I try to avoid
them when I can.
Is this an all-nighter?
No, I’m probably going to
go to bed in the next hour
hopefully.
How do you feel about the
library?
It’s pretty good. It’s a nice
environment. I get a lot more
done here than I do in my
room. It’s good to have a
constant place to work in – it
kinda gets you in the zone.
What's the longest time
you’ve ever spent in the
library?
Probably about nine hours
during the day.
So you’re not really a night
owl then?
Well I am but I’m trying to
sleep earlier. That’s not going
well because exams are
coming up.
What’s the weirdest thing you
have ever seen in the library?
There was fire drill at 1AM. It
was weird, we were just chill-
ing outside. There were 50-60
people and that was during
the Easter break.
What about snacks?
The vending machine
downstairs has my favourite
chocolate bar – Snack bar.
It tastes a bit like chocolate
fingers.
...and drinks?
Mochas or diet cokes or
waters if I’m planning on
sleeping.
How would you describe the
sort of person who spends
a lot of time in the library at
night?
Cramming.
So that’s what you’re doing?
No, I’ve got a month and a
bit before my exam but I feel
behind. I just kind of wanted
to get ahead.
What’s your relationship with
stress?
Highs and lows. Generally at
a high I’ll come to the library.
Anything else you would like
to add?
I just really like this space.
As we bid Fabiola farewell,
Cale pointed out people
come here because they want
no distractions and that we’re
hella distracting.
So we decided to cut our
losses and move on. As we
arrived to the third floor,
another silent study floor, we
were overtaken by dread as
we thought about all the stu-
dents we’d once again have
to bother to be done with
this article. Then a structural
engineer popped out of the
loo and we snatched him and
asked him to step out for a
sec to answer some questions.
After spelling his name for us
Angel Ruizdelarbol told us all
about his relationship with the
library.
Are you gonna spend the
whole night here?
No one more hour.
How often do you do that?
Every day. I study here and in
Skempton. I prefer working at
nights especially now that I no
longer have lectures.
What’s the longest time
you’ve spent in the library?
In one sitting between Skemp-
ton and here – today for
example I had an exam – I’ll
be in the library from 2 p.m.
to 2 a.m. So twelve hours.
That’s a lot of hours. What do
you do for snacks and drinks?
I bring stuff from home nor-
mally. Or go to Wasabi.
And what about the loos?
It’s not fine. Normally… Not
fine.
What’s the most horrifying
thing you’ve seen in the
toilets?
Really? You want to know
that? Blood… piss [He said
jokingly. We presume.]
What kind of person are you?
What kind of person do you
need to be to study so much
at the library?
I’m a happy person, a stress-
ful person.
How do you deal with stress?
I study. It’s better than going
home and watching TV series.
I prefer to study in the library.
At home I can’t concen-
trate, I just watch Netflix or
something.
Angel laughed through-
out our chat. It was unclear
whether he was truly finding
the interview entertaining,
whether he was using laugh-
ter to hide the pain that
usually comes with spending
twelve hours straight in the
library, or whether he was
about to flip out and do a
double murder on us. So we
let him go and went up a level
where we met a chemeng
student that preferred to stay
anonymous.
Are you spending the whole
night here?
I think so. This is the second
or third time I’m doing an
all-nighter.
How do you find it?
I think it’s quite peaceful here
at night. I love it when there’s
not a lot of people around. It
would be great if there were
more beds, I mean couches,
you know places to nap.
Protip: check out the ground
floor computer room.
Yeah I’m thinking of going
there later tonight.
How many hours have you
spent here straight?
Probably twelve hours plus.
I can’t really remember but
definitely at least twelve
hours.
Why are you not home
working?
I used to stay home to study
but recently I found a study
buddy so I come here to
study with him and I think it’s
a great place to come for a
meet up.
You have any snacks you
enjoy during your sessions?
Ah, a Snickers bar? I don’t
know. A Kinder Bueno bar.
Once. I don’t usually have
any snacks or coffee, but I do
drink a lot of water.
Let’s talk hygiene and toilets.
I think the situation could be
improved. Not much else to
say. I don’t mind using them, I
can generally tolerate it.
What kind of person are you?
How do you deal with stress?
I generally don’t mix with
people much, but recently
I found a close friend. Late
at night you’ll probably find
hardcore studying people
here. During the day I usu-
ally go to sleep or to lectures
and tutorials. If I have to. As
for stress, I was really stressed
till I found a buddy.
Anything else you’d like to
add?
I haven’t seen a mouse in the
library but I hope to see one
soon.
On that note we thought it
might be time to head off. So
we finally made our way to
the fifth floor where we were
met with super keen biology
newbie and all-nighter expert
Gunay Arcan.
Have you done this before?
Yes many times. I have a
tutorial for tomorrow. Usually
I’ll leave the tutorial sheet till
the last minute and I’ll have
to stay up all night. I do this
about three times a week
[laughs awkwardly]. I think I
have insomnia.
What’s the longest time
you’ve spent at the library?
Probably from eight in the
evening till eight at night.
Twelve hours.
What’s your routine?
I don’t bring food with me
but I drink a lot of water and
usually take breaks to go the
toilet. But I don’t have any-
thing to eat usually.
So that’s not yours? [pointing
at some sort of wrapper
tucked under a computer]
Yeah I ate that [laughs].
Why are on the fifth floor?
It’s so hot here. I mean you’re
basically in your underwear.
Is it? Well when I got here
it was around 6 p.m. so it
wasn’t that cold. I always
choose the fifth floor ‘cos the
least people come here so it’s
not very busy.
What’s the weirdest thing
you’ve seen in the library?
Mice, there’s a lot of mice. I
have videos of them. They’re
everywhere.
Talks to us about the toilets
and how you deal with them.
They're not good. They smell
bad. I’ve just been and they
are not clean. It doesn’t
bother me too much because
I have to study here. I can’t
concentrate in my room so I
have to stand it.
The fifth floor has a reputation
for boning. Have you ever
seen anyone get it on here?
I’ve never seen anything. I
see girls sitting on the laps of
boys sometimes kissing but
nothing more. Sometimes the
guard making rounds spots
them and asks them to stop.
He’ll say “the Library is a
public space.”
What kind of person are you?
I’m a night owl and I do stress
a lot. I always leave the work
till the very last day and I
don’t learn from my mistakes.
This is why I’m here right now.
I don’t revise properly every
day, I leave it till the last
minute.
How’s that working out for
you?
It’s not working out. I
managed to survive my first
exams but it’s not going to
work now I think. My next
exam is in late June but I’ll
leave it till mid June before I
start revising.
So you’ve already predicted
your failure?
[laughs]
Feeling a lot more care-free
after our conversation with
Gunay we started our decent
back down to the Ground
Floor. We were about to
leave when we decided to
talk to one last person before
calling it a night. Mobolaji
Adekanmbi who was on duty
at the main desk. We talked
for quite a while but we’ve
boiled our conversation down
to two key questions:
Tell us about your relationship
with food and drink.
Oh… We encourage students
to eat food at the cafe or
leave it outside, but some
will try and sneak it inside.
Students complain about
food smells and we have to
tell students that cooked food
isn’t allowed in the library.
Students will eat and keep it
under the table. When you
go around you’ll see it but
you don’t’ know who’s it is.
Some students will sneak in
pizza. Some people come
with electric water boilers
[kettles] to make coffee. But
obviously that’s not allowed in
the library.
Have you ever caught people
making out or boning in the
library?
At night we never experience
that. Apart from one time,
there were some students in
the ladies toilets and that got
reported. The person [who
reported it] heard the voice of
a few people, girls and boys
in the toilets but he didn’t see
them do anything, he didn’t
establish the fact. We spoke
to the student and I think he
said she celebrated her birth-
day and was trying to give
her boyfriend a special treat.
You have a house, you should
have gone to the house
instead of the toilets!
Damn straight.
