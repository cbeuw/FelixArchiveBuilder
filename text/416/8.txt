was a s wet and cold a s usual
as eight shivering runners
set off to prove to a l l and
sundry that were able to run
three m i l e s . T h e race w a s
the metric equivalent of 3
m i l e s or 5000m (we don't
live in the past you know).
It is the C l u b ' s individual
championship race and this
year w a s not unexpectedly
won by R o b A l l i n s o n in a
creditably fast time of 15.17
s e e s . Mr Webb, saving himself
for the Nationals came round
in 16mins 10secs. M i k e
Welford, regaining h i s
youthful I vigour was narrowly
beaten by Rich Harrington in
a good battle for fifth place.
The race of the s e a s o n ,
the E n g l i s h National C r o s s -
country Championships s a w
an overflowing IC team
contending for the 9 places
a v a i l a b l e to run nine miles
with 1,300 others. Both
Andy and Mike were persuaded
to run for the L S E thus giving
us only one non-runner.
The senior race started
downhill and a sea of bobbing
heads could be seen flowing
down the h i l l . T h e temporary
euphoria w a s replaced after
half a mile when the uphill
section started and the
running became difficult. A
number of sand traps and a
sharp downhill stretch were
only fun bits on a remarkably
uninteresting spectators course.
Rob A l l i n s o n had a fine
race, finishing 163rd in h i s
first senior N a t i o n a l . George
Si v e i l , from the little known
Nutritional science department
could not h o l d ' R o b o n the last
lap and finished 351st. Ian
E l l i s finished in 586th, 56
p l a c e s in front of David Rosen
(of crossword and Orienteering
fame) and 79 places in front
of Steve Webb. T h e whole
team finished inside 1000,
a notable achievement in
itself. IC should therefore
finish about half-way in the
team order out of about 200
athletic c l u b s entering.
The post race enquiry
revealed that Mr Webb had
lost a shoe, losing him about
a minute. Mr Davey noted this
down a s excuse number one
and w a s rewarded later in
the evening when the standard
four were a l l revealed.

assured of the league title,

any of ours, a n d he w a s

Andy Smith, despite h i s
substantial f a c i a l injuries
incurred in a previous game,
when tempers were lost.
Dave Lowther started us
off, the way we were determined
to go o n , slotting the b a l l
into the top corner of the net,

trying to stop a ball which
was c l e a r l y on i t s way into

Thermal soaring contest
Out on the plains of
Richmond Park last Saturday,
ten intrepid members of IC
Model Aircraft C l u b could be
seen searching for hot a i r , in
our first ever radio-control
thermal soaring contest.
The idea w a s for each of
he nine entrants to make
three flights from a towline,
the highest average flight
•ime d e c i d i n g the winner.
Fortunately the contest
•vent without a hitch, the
C i u b ' s hard working " A M I G O
!
i " glider taking the twenty-
seven contest flights in her
stride. E s p e c i a l l y gratifying
was the top three p l a c e s
being taken by members who
had never flown radio-control
models before we built the
" A M I G O II" last C h r i s t m a s .
A l s o Mike L e e s broke the
c l u b duration record with h i s
second contest flight, in which
he steered the model into a
strong thermal and stayed
up for over ten minutes.
In a l l , a very enfeyable
contest and free-for-all

LADIES ROWING
Ladies in
first ten
T H E L A D I E S were back on
home waters (a very choppy
Thames, again!) last Saturday
to compete in the Women's
Amateur Rowing Committee's
VIM'S Head from Barnes to
Hammersmith Bridge. This is
one of the main events
in L a d i e s R o w i n g .
Hasty repairs had to made
to the boat before the race
and when we finally d i d
get started, it w a s only very
slo.wly. However, we d i d '
catch-up and overtake Reading
U n i v e r s i t y I who were rowing
in a higher d i v i s i o n in a far
superior boat.
We were the fastest
col[ege crew, and finished
ninth overall, a very creditable
performance.
