" T h e Chairman" by Philip Mackie

T H E R E A R E certain plays on the West
End stage at the moment which shouldn't
be there, and this is one of them. That
was my first reaction to this p i e c e . It's
perfect for a two part television play
but it just doesn't work on a live stage.
If I were required to put it into a tidy
slot I would c a l l it an O f f i c e Comedy
with added ethics.
Having pondered this for a little
while I s e e that my first ideas were
quite wrong. If our aim is to get more
people to go to the live theatre, for the
first time, and I quite sincerely believe
that a great number of people who have
never seen professional live acting are
m i s s i n g an awful lot, then this must
be the right sort of thing, and it is for
this reason that I c a n identify it s o
c l o s e l y with the sort of television
output we see on our screens week after
IC Dramatic Society's Production of
Two Gentlemen of Verona
by William Shakespeare
Directed by Mark Frank
T H E P L A Y i s one of Shakespeares
earlier ones, and one of h i s less well
known. T h e plot is simple — one young
man (Proteus) f a n c i e s h i s friend's
(Valentine) girlfriend, and nearly s u c c e e d s
in winning her.
The stage props are a challenge to
anyone attempting this production as
the action passes from street to house
to forest to abbey, and this problem w a s
ingeniously overcome by using an
abstract back cloth which w a s modified
between s c e n e s . T h e normal stage w a s
abondoned in favour of a (perhaps
more traditional) open one, placed
sideways in the concert h a l l , and with
no curtains or other barriers between
actors and audience. Altogether, it
week.
Set in the public relations office of
a large manufacturing organisation,
"The Chairman"depicts the manipulation
of the members of the department by
their director. T h e first a c t contains
a l l the old routines of farewell parties
for loyal employees, welcome to new
e x e c u t i v e s and the v i s i t of the dreaded
business efficiency expert. T h e latter
appears after the director h a s c o n -
veniently found an e x c u s e to head for
N e w York, and h i s maniacal deputy is
left to hold the fort. T h e underlings a l l
confess the pointlessness of their jobs
w h i l s t the deputy proves to be the
odd-man-out with h i s conviction that he
i s indispensible. T h e director returns
at the critical moment to restore
everyone's confidence by pointing out
that without the public relations depart-
ment the mysterious bogey man, "The
Chairman' , would be shown up to be
the cardboard figure he really i s ; he
then goes on to manoeuvre h i s sub-
ordinates into fresh posts without
anyone realising and we are surprised
to see how- easy it i s .
Tony Britton plays the director with
the suavity we would expect from any
appeared the director's intention to
bring about a c l o s e rapport between
actors and audience, and this w a s
only marred by the stage hands w h o
walked boldly onto the stage between
scenes a s if they were part of the
play. T h e simple expedient of dimming
the lights between scenes could have
done much to maintain the atmosphere.
The acting w a s at times, quite
impressive: e s p e c i a l points of note were
Ian Morrison's very lifelike portrayal of
the periods when Proteus w a s at h i s
most s l y and devious, and the comic
interplay between servants L a u n c e
(Eric Stovell) and Speed. (Chris Wells).
Both these parts of the play must come
a c r o s s if the play is to be a s u c c e s s —
the first part because the whole plot
depends on the credibility of P r o t e u s ,
while the second is a light hearted
break for the audience without which
the play would become too heavy.
The boldness of Valentine (Richard
Smith), the thorough idiocy of Thurio
self-respecting P R man. T h e real tour
de force comes from Peter Blythe a s
the deputy who can seldom manage to
end one sentence before lunging into
the next. Although h i s performance
started out a bit j o o self-indulgently
he w a s soon into h i s stride with a
laugh which should have driven h i s
c o l l e a g u e s out of the office in five
minutes.
Whether this i s a vehicle for Mr
M a c k i e ' s d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n with the ethics
of public relations or a comedy pure
and simple c a n be decided by the
audience, but I suspect that the latter
w i l l win the day and the former w i l l
sink without trace. I must confess that
I did enjoy myself.

I hope to be reporting fully next
term on the National Student Drama
F e s t i v a l . T h i s takes place in Edinburgh
from the 2nd to 11th of A p r i l . T e n
U n i v e r s i t i e s and C o l l e g e s w i l l be
represented by productions ranging from
Chekhov, through Beckett and Orton to
several n e w plays by student writers.
D i s c u s s i o n s w i l l be l e d by J o a n B a k e w e l l
Jonathan H a l e s , J W Lambert, C h a r l e s
Marowitz, E A Whitehead and many others.
(Roger P h i l i p s ) , the emotion of J u l i a
(Pam S e l l a r s ) , the perception of S y l v i a
(Helen L a w s o n ) , were, o v e r a l l , s u c c e s s -
fully transmitted to the audience, a s
was the lack of acting talent of
Lasince's dog.
The difficulties that the cast had
in making sure that the p l a y ' s pace w a s
kept such that the witty lines appeared
fast without leaving the audience behind
were apparent at certain times. Whereas
a l l the most important s c e n e s were
timed very w e l l , I w a s made very
apprehensive at the start by some l o s s
in the clarity of production. T h e same
happened at the e n d , but this may be
blamed on Shakespeare's sudden " a n d
they a l l lived happily ever after"
ending.
I felt a little disappointed at the
programme which I paid for, and no
doubt at least one of the actresses i s
somewhat peeved at the unhelpful
c a s t list ordering.

Opera
King Roger by Szymanowski (English
National Opera at the London Coliseum
March 2 2 , April 1 and 9',
IT WAS more thought-provoking than
purely pleasureable to s e e a rare
performance of this P o l i s h opera dating
from 1926.
King Roger ruled in S i c i l y in the
12th century and this opera concerns
his transformation from a man of the
intellect alone to one who acknowledges
the equal claims of beauty, sensuality
and freedom, personified, or one should
say deified, by Dionysos who appears
to the K i n g and h i s Court in the form
of a shepherd proclaiming a new
religion. When persuaded by the e c c l e -
s i a s t i c s to banish the shepherd for
heresy, the K i n g loses a l l h i s courtiers
to the land of freedom and delight
and s o finally decides to cast off the
attributes of royalty a n d , wearing only
a loincloth, offers up a hymn to the
sun on the altar of a ruined Greek
theatre where h i s search for the shepherd
has led him.
Szymanowki is a name probably
unfamiliar and daunting to most, but I
found h i s mgsic reminded me most of
Debussy with an additional smattering
of Richard Strauss to represent the
sensuousness of D i o n y s o s . In many
ways the opera is similar to D e b u s s y ' s
P e l leas et Melisande sharing with it
a lack of obvious dynamic variation s o
that the final act seemed to stop rather
than build to a climax. Unfortunately it
lacked D e b u s s y ' s subtlety s o that the
more dramatic points in the narrative
were emphasised in the music with
sudden, loud dischords of brass and
percussion made a l l the more histrionic
by their' contrast with the surrounding
repose.
The E n g l i s h National Opera matched
the music with a staging that used little
movement and s o the combined effect
was rather s t a i d . T h i s w a s not helped
by the u s e of a huge gauze for the
final act which covered the entire
proscenium arch a n d , lit from behind,
provided a transparent wall between
singers and audience. I found the
effect most disconcerting and it seemed
extreme for the few visual effects which
it allowed.
O n e ' s parting doubts were not
eased by a self-indulgent s u c c e s s i o n
of curtain c a l l s to the sound of rapidly
diminishing applause from a full first-
night house. E r j c s t o w e , |
Cinema
" F a r e w e l l , My L o v e l y " (Fox-Rank,
A A ) . Directed by Dick Richard;
starring Robert Mitchum, Charlotte
Rampling, Sylvia Miles'.
I have never really thought of
Charlott Rampling a s a sex-symbol, but
if s h e keeps c r o s s i n g and uncrossing
her legs a s she does in this film then
my opinion could undergo rapid change.
However, her performance w a s not very
c o n v i n c i n g and acting credits here must
go to Robert Mitchum a s P h i l i p Marlowe
and S y l v i a M i l e s a s the a l c o h o l i c
Mrs F l o r i a n . She could teach some
people in this C o l l e g e a thing or two
about drinking!
