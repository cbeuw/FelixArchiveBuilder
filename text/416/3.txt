Reporter: Well Sir, what do
you think of this guy L a i t h -
wate? Do you think that h i s
lecture and demonstration w a s
just a box of tricks covered
thinly by a facade of impressive
formulae and half truths? A
clever fraud?
HGW: Young man, I think you
miss the point. T h e Professor
undoubtedly knows what he
can do and is able to do but
a l s o , a s he s a i d , he is often
unable to explain how he
performs h i s " t r i c k s " . What
is more important I feel, is
that he forces u s to question
what we know and accept a s
true. We blindly acknowledge
many so c a l l e d facts and
laws, without question, a s
the indisputable truth. Pro-
fessor Laithwaite shows us'
the paradoxes inherent in
many of the laws and truths.of
P h y s i c s . I think that he may
be capable of destroying not
only the complacency of
physicists but a l s o the
aquiesence of other s c i e n t i s t s
to the dogma that everything
can be described ultimately
in terms of P h y s i c s .
Reporter: Do you think that
he is undermining the
foundations of s c i e n c e ? I
mean, to understand phenomena
we must describe them ip
specified terms. Is it not
destructive and indeed
ridiculous to c a l l a magnetic
field "nothing described in a
rather elaborate w a y " .
HGW:' That I cannot s a y . H e
is undoubtedly risking a great
deal of s c i e n t i f i c respect-
ability in presenting h i s
theories in such a popular
way. In a similar way s c i e n c e
fiction is treated with con-
tempt a s fanciful and flippant
dreaming, yet there is often
an underlying basis of truth.
Science i s not always dry,
humourless and serious yet
it breeds so many serious and
humourless s c i e n t i s t s .
Reporter: Do you agree that
there is a difference between
doing and knowing how?
HGW: Y e s I do. In this lies
the difference between
technology and s c i e n c e . There
should be no dichotomy. There
should be hybrids of theoretical
scientists and practical
technologists; the Professor
provides a good example. Y e t
even h i s ideas sbould be
viewed with an objective
and critical mind.
Reporter: Thank you S i r ,
and good luck with your
Time Machine.

ICWA LOOSE THE BALL
TONY FITZGERALD (above) and Fred Tutcher
(below) were two luckless victims who fell foul of
the ICWA Rugby team at Harlington last Sunday.
Both left the field somewhat under-dressed after
playing ICWA in the RCS Rugby Sevens. Even the
referee managed to loose his trousers in iCWA's first
game against Physics I - though not at the hands
of ICWA!
Other ICWA tactics included loose-ruck ball-play,
trouser fondling, off-the-ball handling and close
quarter tickling. Despite drawing two of their three
games the team just failed to qualify for the semi-
finals of the competition. The eventual winners were
Chemistry I who beat Life Sciences in the final.
The only real casualty of the event was Adrian
Sudworth who managed to loose his memory.
