ORIENTEERING
Cry havoc
RUGBY
Navy sunk
Imperial College A ' s :
Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve:
"The defence cuts have gone
too far." That was the cry
from the A ' s changing room,
when it was discovered that
the Royal Navy Volunteer
Reserve had arrived with only
twelve men. The A ' s reserves
had to be press-ganged into
service to even things out.
Steve Downing and P h i l
John were the 'volunteers',
although it must be recorded
that it took a tea ticket to
get Steve into the right frame
of mind for doing his duty.
A l l that having been settled
the game commenced with the
R N V R electing to play into
a deceptive wind. It took only
five minutes, and Mike
Siomiak, to show them the
error of their w a y s . Dick
P u l l e n converted and the
flood gates (sorry I) were
opened. The A ' s were up 1 8 - 0
before R N V R could rally to
offer any significant resistance
and that, not to put too fine a
point on it, was contemptuously
swept aside. The A ' s plunged
on to a 3 4 - 0 lead at half time,
following tries by John Day
(two), Rod Porter and George
Sweatman.
P l a y i n g into the wind was
a different story. Soon after
the start P h i l J o h n , (on
loan to the R N V R ) , suffered
such a confusion of loyalties
that he pulled a try back fq,r
the JNIavy, (but he made up for
it later by giving Mike
Siomiak h i s second try). The
50
13
lead was cut further by a
penalty. Having conceded
nine points the A ' s decided
to make a comeback. M i k e ' s
second try was followed by
tries from Bob Leeson and
John Thomas (making amends
for last week). The last score
of the match went to the
N a v y . It should have been
scored by the A ' s but Rich
Jenner, with a three-man
overlap, gave a forward p a s s .
Thus, the A ' s won by
5 0 - 1 3 , their highest score
of the season and a fitting
end, for it was the last
game.
The A ' s have played fifteen
games of which they have
won eight and lost seven,
with 268 points for and 216
points against. Jon Pitcher
finished top try scorer with
seven, just ahead of C h r i s
Becque with s i x tries. Top
scorer Queto h i s seven
conversion's on Saturday, was
D i c k P u l l e n who finished
with thirty-three points.

9- Chris Cuthbectsbn
A 9 A M S T A R T on a Sunday
morning is difficult, but a
9am start on the morning
following the 9 mile National
C r o s s Country championships
is impossible. So the group
of athletes who double as
C r o s s c o u n t r y and Orienteering,
were the last to arrive at the
H A V O C badge event near
Brentwood, E s s e x last
Sunday. The late start meant
that unless some very fast
times were recorded IC would
not be able to make the pub
before c l o s i n g time.
The course was fairly flat
but there were some areas
of rather dense undergrowth
(including holly bushes!) to
fight through. A l s o the
compact nature of the course
meant that it doubled back
on itself many times and
o c c a s i o n a l l y gave a distinct
sense of deja vu.
On the 11km ' A ' course
D a v i d Rosen was 1st home in
a time of 69.23 underlining
the reason for his selection
for the international match
in France next week. A l i s t a i r
Doyle of U L was 9th home
in 86.25 followed c l o s e l y
by A l a n Leakey 18th in 89.40
and Rob A l l i n s o n 23rd in
The first try of this match
was scored within 90 seconds
of the start and that virtually
heralded the end of it. The
score could e a s i l y have
reached three figures but for
the handling and running of
the forwards and b a c k s .
Nevertheless, L a d l e jinxed
his way to two tries and
Flanagan playing his first
game for IC for two years
coasted over for a hat-trick.
L a c k , the infamous footballer
starring on the left wing,
a l s o put the ball over three
93.05. Some way back were
Steve Webb in 109.40 and
Pete J o h n s o n , who was seen
at various times leading in
random directions, in 123.55.
On the 9km ' B ' course Ian
I sherwood had a very good
run, achieving a s i l v e r
standard, finishing 12th in
94.25 while Mike Welford was
21st in 112.37 after reading
his compass at the wrong end
and setting off west instead
of east!
Other good placings were
Ian McAnulty and Len Fawcett
finishing 4th and 7th in
112.25 and 123.16 respectively
on the under 21 Course.
Martin K e s s l e r decided
the ' B ' course was too much
like hard work and instead
ran 'out of c l a s s ' on the C
course finishing in 112.35.
I C ' s only woman athlete
Diane Benge finished 5th in
98.33 on the woman's ' B '
course.
We all made the pub with
10 minutes to spare except

the finish) and J o , Marcus

did the way farers course but
unfortunately m i s s s e d a
control).
times. Keith Munday normally
legless, found them and scored
after a 60 yard burst. Mike
also got on the score sheet.
Clements had to go off in
the second half, but the
highlight of the match was a
rather inexplicable move
by Wilkinson. F o r reasons
apparent only to himself, he
kicked at a line-out and^tne
forty yard follow-up almost
finished off the referee.
The most s u c c e s s f u l outing
for the B 2 ' s in recent weeks
was celebrated in fine s t y l e .

A s with all Chandler stories, the
plot is fairly involved and moves at a
fairly brisk pace. Marlowe is hired by
Moose Malloy (Jack O'Halloran), an
oversized brute and bank robber, out on
parole and looking for his girl friend
Velma.
Velma, however, does not want to
be found and poor Marlowe gets really
kicked around and pumped full of drugs
in h i s attempts to find her. H i s lot is
not helped, by the police who want to
use him as a scapegoat for several
unsolved murders.
In the final scene, on a floating
c a s i n o , everything is revealed and
each gets h i s / h e r " j u s t " deserts.
The winner; Marlowe.
" D i a m o n d s " (Fox-Rank, A) Directed
by Menahem Golan; starring Robert
Shaw, Richard Roundtree, Barbara
Seagull and Shelley Winters.
The Hodgson brothers have only one
thing in common; diamonds. C h a r l e s
d e a l s in them and Earl protects them.
A little brotherly hatred c a u s e s problems
and poor Archie (Richard Roundtree),
fresh out of j a i l , is caught in the
middle.
A r c h i e is hired by C h a r l e s (Robert
Shaw) to " r o b " the largest Diamond
exchange in the world. The exchange, in
Tel A v i v , is supposedly fool-proof
(with s a f e s and security by E a r l ) .
There is a " s i m p l e " plot with a few
distractions thrown in. The acting is
reasonable with Robert Shaw leading the
pack, a varied bunch. The Three Degrees
sing the song " D i a m o n d s " â€” just
beautiful.
Music
Heaven and Hell (RCA) by Vangelis
T h i s is a varitable one-man marathon.
V a n g e l i s composed all the music,
played a l l the instruments, sundry or
otherwise, and produced and arranged
the album to boot. Y e t , the album does
not sink into the self-indulgent rut
that similar s o l o efforts tend to d o .
It is however, rather difficult to
describe his music, certainly, it has
many influences. My first impression
was that he had taken some Magma times,
cut out most of the percussion, and
substituted m a s s e s of keyboards, and
thrown in the vocal chorus to hear what
it would sound like. (Good in parts, a
bit strange in others).
If you are into s e m i - c l a s s i c a l music
y o u ' l l enjoy this one. One point worth
noting here is the excellent production.
The Tymes: Tymes Up ( R C A )
Once you get over the nauseating
cover design it is p o s s i b l e to get down
to enjoying what is a rather pleasant
album. It comes from the stable of
commercialised soul/funky music.
I personally find the album somewhat
over produced, but a few tracks do stand
out. " O n l y Your L o v e " and " I t ' s C o o l "
on s i d e one, the latter is a particularly
good e s p e c i a l l y in the v o c a l s department.
The only track I actually went into
raptures over is the first one on side
two; " H y p n o t i z e d " . Everything that
should be in a good record is embodied
in this fine p i e c e .
Produced by B i l l y J a c k s o n , for
F l o w e r Pot Productions, the album also
features T S O P on strings and horn.
