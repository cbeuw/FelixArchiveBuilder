IC Radio-the why's and wherefore's
" W H A T A R E those strange sounds we
hear on Tueaday lunchtime"? you may
wonder to yourself. You might a l s o
inquire as to who is behind it and
even further, is it really necessary?
F i r s t l y , the n o i s e s on Tuesday
lunctimes are made by Imperial
College Radio. The idea of a radio
station on campus w a s conceived
about two years ago and has been
snowballing ever s i n c e . Up till recently
(see F E L I X No 414) the lack of a
test licence had been prohibiting
progress. In order not to lose enthusiastic
members, they searched for something
to do that was vaguely connected with
their ultimate g o a l . The college public
address systems were the obvious
target and that is why you " l i s t e n " to
Imperial C o l l e g e " R a d i o " on Tuesday.
Secondly, the question of n e c e s s i t y .
The answer is quite simply, debatable.
They obviously think so, as do the
Union and the C o l l e g e . The way IC
Radio look at it, they are attempting to
provide a service to the IC community
within the immediate vicinity of C o l l e g e
in an entirely new way. IC Radio
produces n e w s and " w h a t ' s - o n "
bulletins which include national and
student news, and intersperse them
with good music and witty;?) comments
from D J ' s .
So far, the music policy has been
left entirely to the individual d i s c
jockey, which means that certain
types of music are left untouched. T h i s
is evidenced by the obvious lack of
soul and reggae music in the music
put out. However, they have yet to
receive complaints.
At present, the programmes can be
heard, at various times, in the J C R , the
Buttery and the refectory in the Sherfield
B u i l d i n g . They have had to end trans-
missions to the Main Refectory because
of the bad sound quality. At one time
they tried to produce programmes which
could be heard in the Union and Southside
refectories, both of which p o s s e s s good
acoustic properties.
Here they hit more snags; there
were no f a c i l i t i e s for live programme
production at either location. T h i s
meant that the programmes had to be
pre-recorded, but this was a time-
consuming method and the idea was
finally abondoned. They are at the
moment talking about laying cables
from the IC Radio room to the Union and
to the Sherfield B u i l d i n g . T h i s would
then enable them to put out live broad-
c a s t s to these places and reach a
bigger audience.
One of the main driving forces (and
general P R man) behind IC Radio is
John A l l e n , a Management S c i e n c e
P G . He was also one of the pioneers of
the scheme and has been instrumental
in the progress so far achieved. Those
of you who " l i s t e n " to IC Radio w i l l
know him as the "Moody B l u e s F r e a k " .
The other station managers are Steve
Barron and Paul May who is responsible
for the " j i n g l e s " .
Another prominent member of IC
Radio is its N e w s Editor, Nigel Miller.
He does a remarkable job sifting
through newspapers, finding relevant
and topical news stories for his bulletins.
Ian C a i r n s is their Promotions officer,
although he is rarely seen about the
place. He c o l l e c t s and c o l l a t e s the
m a s s e s of advertising material sent to
him by C o l l e g e s o c i e t i e s . Another
grafter is Dave Chance, the Secretary.
He is the paper-work man - a symptom
of a bureaucratic U n i o n .
Behind the scenes are three stalwarts
known as T e c h n i c a l Managers. They
are John Comfort, Mike Elgey and Tim
Shelton. They run everything on the
technical side.
Now that they have received the
test licence they are faced with a
manpower problem for next year. T h i s
is because many of their present members
are third year students so if you want to
try your hand at d i s c jockeying, interview
or can help technically, get in touch with
John A l l e n or Steve Barron - they w i l l
be glad to hear from you.
Whose BOSS? South Africa
-the London connection
T H E L I B E R A L P A R T Y has been rocked
by scandel in recent weeks and South
African companies have been named
a s financing the " f r a m i n g " of prominent
o f f i c i a l s . However, the full range of
South African a c t i v i t i e s abroad ranges
from slander to espionage. Incredible
as it may seem, this murky, sub-James
Bond world is nearer than you think ...
On Friday 20th February, the lodgings
of an IC student in Tufnell Park, North
London were broken into. H i s landlord
is the chief representative in Western
Europe of the African National Congress
of South A f r i c a . Several valuable
items were stolen, but the thief had
a l s o shown a peculiar interest in
documents and files; opening several
letters during his stay. It was as if
he was looking for something.
South A f r i c a has recently been under
a great deal of pressure from all sides
and not surprisingly, appears to be
protecting its interests by an active,
if secret, participation in the affairs
of other countries. The E n g l i s h - s p e a k i n g
world, and in particular, Britain, seems
to be the main sphere of activity outside
Southern A f r i c a .
Involvement seems to be split into
two types; the first to enhance the
image of South A f r i c a and cultivate
friends, the second, and perhaps more
sinister traditional espionage concerning
dissident groups operating inside and
outside their country ( A N C , etc).
The goings-on in the Liberal Party
were attributed by Harold Wilson to
South African companies operating in
Britain. He denied the influence of the
South African government, but there
can be little doubt that BOSS, the S A
Bureau of State Security w a s implicated.
B e s i d e s the " f r a m i n g " of Peter Hain
and Jeremy Thorpe, anonymous letters
have been sent to the M P , C y r i l Smith
and his mother. Rumours have a l s o been
circulated concerning the involvement of
Clement Freud's daughter in a porno-
graphic film.
Why might the South African government
wish to destroy the reputation of the
L i b e r a l s ? Purely for revenge, as they
have been amongst the most outspoken
and bitter c r i t i c s of apartheid in the
past? Or, as Peter H a i n thinks, to elect
a Conservative government which would
look more favourably on them than
Labour?
A more obvious way of promoting
South A f r i c a can be seen in one-page
advertisements in the national press,
in H o l l a n d , two newsreaders were
sacked for changing the text of news
bulletins. The reports, which were
broadcast to South A f r i c a in Afrikaans
became more favourable to apartheid
after being translated from Dutch.
The other s i d e of BOSS is no less
active. There have been numerous
break-ins attributed to security agents.
Another member of the A N C was robbed
while he was out of the country;
several documents were taken, and the
theif left Â£80 in cash in an opened
drawer.
Mr J a m e s Wellbeloved, Labour M P ,
delivered last week to the Prime
M i n i s t e r ' s office a d o s s i e r of over
twenty such c a s e s of suspected South
African involvement in B r i t a i n . He
believes that recent burglaries of the
Prime Minister and three of his staff
show simi lar features.
A n ugly consequence of these
robberies can be seen in the c a s e of
Peter Moumbaris. In 1972, a fair-headed
young man approached Mr Moumbaris'
mother in London, with a forged letter
asking for the key to his flat. She
gave it to him and at Moumbaris' trial
in South A f r i c a , documents were produced
in evidence which could only have
come from that London flat.
Prime Minister Vorster, of South
A f r i c a d i s m i s s e s these allegations as
" a b s o l u t e rubbish", but stolen documents
were a l s o produced at the trial of the
Dean of Johannesburg.
It is unlikely that BOSS is involved
in all that it's name has been linked
with. A s the head of BOSS s a y s , "I
would not be surprised to learn my bureau
was being held responsible for the
death of a Persian cat in a London
s t r e e t . "
A l l the evidence points, though, to
an unhealthy and illegal interest in our
domestic p o l i t i c s , which prompts the
question, in Britain, " W h o ' s B o s s ? "
