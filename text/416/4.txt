Football Club
F I V E MEMBERS of this club have blatantly shown them-
selves to be incontinent and irresponsible. In addition,
they have perpetrated acts that can only be described as
deliqnent.
It is no sniprise that the Club has dissociated itself
from the activities of its five members; however, the club
officials cannot totally be absolved of all responsibility.
As organisers, it is their duty to ensure that Union rooms
booked in the Club's name are left in a reasonable condition.
This clearly was not done.
The rise and . . . .
T H E IMMINENT demise of Sennet has created quite a
furore in U L U , especially amongst smaller colleges which
depend on it for news of events happening in the London
student area. This is not the first (and probably will not
be the last) time that Sennet has faced doom. As before,
the problem is one of money.
Financial crisis finally jumped into Sennet's path when
their advertising revenue began to drop. To date, Sennet
has accrued a loss of £1500; this is expected to be £3000
by the end of next term. U L U have £22,000 to spend on its
78 clubs and societies this year — the dent, U L U feels,
that Sennet's debt would make is rather large.
However, they have been given a chance to stay alive —
if they obtain enough advertising revenue to cover costs
then Sennet will appear that week. It is a sensible decision
by U L U , especially when there is a strong feeling that the
standard of the paper has gone down drastically this year.
Refectories
IT IS ENCOURAGING to see that the criticisms levelled
at the Catering Service have yielded positive results.
Without doubt, the food served in the refectories has
improved, especially in the Union — witness the increased
number of students eating there.
The hard work that the Catering staff have put in is a
credit to them. The new meals service introduced in South
side seems to be working well. Given some money to modern-
ise the equipment, the sky may be the limit.

PROF. BREMSSTRAHLUN6
Pakistan Society
SOME O F Y O U may wonder
what the role of the Pakistan
Society is within IC? The
simple answer i s that one of
its purposes i s to acquaint
you with the Art and Culture
of P a k i s t a n , and to convey to
you, through this media, the
message of P e a c e and self-
respect for which we and
our culture stand.
The P a k i s t a n Society is
an organisation of students
from Pakistan and those
interested in it. Our aim is
two-fold; firstly, we endeavour
to provide P a k i s t a n i students
at IC with a forum for meeting
each other and getting to
know this country. Secondly,
we try to arrange functions,
film-shows, lectures, e t c . ,
to introduce Pakistan and
its ideology to the students
pf Imperial C o l l e g e .
To these ends, we arranged
a film show, a musical evening
celebrating E i d f e s t i v a l (the
M u s l i m s e q u i v a l e n t of
Christmas) and our most
adventurous event to date, a
musical variety programme
which featured Mohammad
K a s s a m .
The film show, staged in
conjunction with the Islamic
Society in order to reduce
c o s t s , consisted of s i x
f i l m s . These introduced Islam,
P a k i s t a n and the Arab struggle
for the liberation of P a l e s t i n e
and Jerusalem.
The musical variety
programme was very colourful
and attracted an audience of
about 1000 people. 'Parvartee',
a young, beautiful singer and
dancer, was probably one
of the main reasons for the
large crowds.
Recordings of the show
were put out by B B C Radio
London on its programme for
A s i a n listeners.
We a l s o held a rag c o l l e c t i o n
at the end of the show and
c o l l e c t e d about £24. T h i s
idea, I believe, could be
pursued by other s o c i e t i e s .
However little such a c o l l e c t i o n
might be, it would be an
additional contribution to
R A G .
I would a l s o like to suggest
that a l l s o c i e t i e s should
look into the p o s s i b i l i t i e s
of staging functions jointly -
t h i s would help to m i n i m i s e
c o s t s providing there is no
c l a s h of interests.
F i n a l l y , I would like to
extend my thanks to the
E x e c u t i v e Committee and
members of the Society who
helped to make the programmes
a s u c c e s s .
