This is the latest film from Bill
Forsyth, director of that brilliant
comedy about young love Gregory's
Girl.
Helen Stone drops her two children
with her mother before committing
suicide. The childrens' grandmother
takes devoted care of them until she
dies seven years later. The children
are placed in the unwilling care of
Helen's sister, Sylvie Fisher, and
slowly grow up.
One of the most notable things
about Bill Forsyth's films is his
refusal, even at the risk of having his
films condemned as 'charming', to
lend any weight to the elements of
myth and magic that lurk below their
surface. The elaborate ritual which
guides the unwitting Gregory to the
girl destined to be his sleeping beauty,
or the influence that Olympian
goddesses Stella and Marina wield
over the affairs of men in Local Hero.
Housekeeping has the slant-eyed
view of reality that hallmarks all
Forsyth's previous films; when
goaded by the children about the mess
of old tins littering the kitchen, Sylvie
lovingly scrubs them all and arranges
them in beautiful, gleaming pyramids
on the table.
Housekeeping is a film about
growing up, about the pressures in the
world to conform. The film retains
much of the subtlety of the novel by
Marilynne Robinson from which it
was adapted.
'To crave and to have are as like
as a thing and its shadow. For when
does a berry break upon the tongue
as sweetly as when one longs to taste
it...and when do our senses know
anything so utterly as when we lack
it? And here again is a
foreshadowing—the world will be
made whole. For to wish for a hand
on one's hair is all but to feel it. So
whatever we may lose, very craving
gives it back to us again.'
The craving the girls experience is
for a sense of family, denied to them
as circumstances pass them along
from one pseudo-family to another.
They pore over meaningless
photographs, asking eager questions
about their parents, and receive only
vague answers. A shot near the
beginning shows the two apparently
about to fall from their high window
perch. Then we see that they are in
fact safely tethered—but the image is
that even family ties are no security.
This all may make Housekeeping
seem like an unbearably grim
experience, but it isn't. It's a great
film, one hundred per cent Forsyth in
manner and mood.

(Cert 15)
Yet another modern vampire movie,
following hot on the heels of last
week's Near Dark.
In the small California town of
Santa Clara, the two teenage sons of
just-divorced Lucy Emerson, Michael
and Sam, run into trouble. Sam is
warned by the owners of the local
comic-book store that the town is
infested with vampires. Michael is
tricked into drinking blood, and is
half turned into a vampire. Sam
realises what's going on when his
brother's reflection starts to fade, but
he can be saved if the local head
vampire is destroyed before Michael
makes his first kill.
The Lost Boys is an uneven film,
reflecting the fact that it's been kicked
around by and rewritten by too many
people. It was originally supposed to
be a sort of Peter Pan, but has been
stripped of all its J M Barrie
associations, except for the title and
the mixing of the kindly father figure
and head villian into one role. The
film does have a few witty lines, but
it seems that the influence of co-
producer Richard Donner has been far
too strong—in parts, The Lost Boys
gets uncomfortable like The Goonies,
which Donner directed for Steven
Spielberg. In one sequence, the young
kids run screaming through a maze of
caves infested with teenage vampires
who hang upside down from the
roof—too close to The Goonies for
comfort.
The film is firmly directed towards
commericalism—MTV rock, pretty-
boy teen vampires with trendy clothes
and haircuts, doses of comedy
whenever anything starts getting too
horrific, special effects trickery and
Spielbergian flying scenes. All this
eats away at the fascinating potential
of the vampire genre; in fact, The Lost
Boys is the complete opposite to Near
Dark. The film seems to start
promisingly enough, with on-the-
streets footage of listless weirdos
hanging around the streets of Santa
Clara, drifting from boardwalk to
fairground. But the introduction of
junior Rambos who talk comically
tough, combined with the heavy doses
of garlic-throwing slapstick and
smark alec exchanges, all combine to
spoil the film.
The Lost Boys tries to be another
Fright Night, and fails; it has none of
the class of the previous movie. It
isn't as funny, frightening or striking
as Fright Night because it doesn't
have a consistent tone. This is a
shame, since there are some fairly
exciting melt down effects, and one
or two eerie touches, such as the
vampires stepping off a bridge to
disappear into the fog below.
Probably the worst thing about the
film is the fact that it's villains aren't
at all frightening, but very stupid,
blundering into all sorts of traps. I
came out of the film wishing that the
vampires had got the panicky,
tiresomely hyperactive crew of junior
brats that are supposed to be the
heroes.
If you must go and see a vampire
movie, see Near Dark—it's
thoughtful, funny and well vm&t.The
Lost Boys has good effects, some
funny lines, but loses out when it
comes to likeability.

Paul Newman manages to step from
impressive achievement to impressive
achievement and his direction of The
Glass Menagerie is no exception. The
film is really a film-of-the-play by
Tennessee Williams, who regarded it
as an attempt to break away from
conventional theatre and 'the
photographic in art'. The film is a
perfect photographic record of the
play—yet Newman manages to
circumnavigate this fact—the actor's
cinema, in the best sense, creating
from theatrical ensembles and interior
dramas an undeniably cinematic
mood.
Newman directs his excellent cast
expertly, and doesn't succumb to the
temptation of 'opening' everything
up, which would have totally
destroyed the atmosphere.
The central image of the film is
light: light symbolises both the pain
and inextinguishability of memory.
Dim lighting is remembrance. Lights
from the dance hall across the street
are a distraction from enclosed family
life. The prisms of light in the
menagerie are refugees from the
shadows outside. Then all light is lost,
because the family can't pay their
bills. So candlelight takes over-
radiance at the expectation of life.
The Glass Menagerie is this week's
'deep' film. It's long, but well worth
sitting through if you're one of those
people who likes a lot of intelligence
and no gunshots in your films. I
thought it was excellent.

y and Rosie Get Laid
(Cert 18)
From the director of My Beautiful
Laundrette comes a tale of society
threatened by anarchy and disorder.
It opens with vistas of urban waste
and squalor, Margaret Thatcher's
voice-over ordering the inner cities to
heal themselves through hard work
and hope. But, unfortunately, the film
isn't nearly as good as My Beautiful
Laundrette—Hit characters are a bit
too one dimensional, and the
sketching in of family and social
relationships is too episodic. The
main character—an ex-colonial
freedom fighter, Rafi Rahman-
commits suicide. In the wake of this,
it's difficult to care whether or not
Sammy and Rosie do indeed get laid.
Sammy and Rosie Get Laid is worth
a look if you're really keen on
contemporary 'thinking' films.

Why oh why? This film i« designed

This film is the genuine article-
