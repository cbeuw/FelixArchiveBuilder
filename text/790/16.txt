DANCE CLUB
National
R o c k ' n ' R o l l
Competition
On January 30 Imperial College will
play host to the National Student Rock
'n' Roll Competition. Far from it
being 'just another' dance competition
the evening promises to be a
spectacular event to watch and/or
participate in.
Generous sponsorship from Grant
Thornton Chartered Accountants has
enabled us to book an exciting and
talented dance group by the name of
the Kansas City Jivers. Their lead
dancer is presently the British Free-
Style Dance Champion.
The student rock 'n' roll event,
hopes to attract entries from all over
the country, hence the early start of
5.30pm. These couples will perform
one minute of intricate continental
style footwork followed by a further
two minutes of dazzling and
sometimes dangerous acrobatics in
each of the elimination rounds. Only
six couples will reach the final.
In addition to the above event there
will be a more light-hearted event
open to anyone and everyone as long
as they follow these few rules:
1. Couples only (but - any
combination of sexes is acceptable!!).
2. Absolutely no acrobatics.
3. Winners will be judged on
entertainment value based on style of
dress as well as style of dance.
Last year nearly everybody that
attended the evening entered this
event.
Throughout the evening there will
be plenty of opportunity to dance,
learn to dance or even just to watch
the dancing. There may be a few
light-hearted competitions and there
will be a bar available with light
refreshments. The evening is due to
start at 5.30pm in the Great Hall,
Sherfield Building. Tickets are only
£3 available from Neil McCluskey
(Min Tech 3), Dinah Woodhurst
(Physics 3) or from the Union Office.
Everybody is welcome, staff,
students, dancers, non-dancers.
Support will be particularly
appreciated for the Imperial College
couples competing which included the
defending Student Rock 'n' Roll
Champions.
IC YHA
Escape to somewhere wild
Have you ever thought about escaping
from IC into some wild part of
Britain, to relax, take in fresh air, and
revitalise your mental state?
ICYHA can take you away from
London to the vast, desolate moors of
the Peaks or Dartmoor, to the
spectacular hills of Snowdonia or
Brecon, to the rolling lands of the
Purbeck coastline, or the quiet world:
of the New Forest.
Last term ICYHA travelled to these
destinations, on average, about a
dozen people packing into a minibus
on Friday nights, to spend the
weekend away. Usually walking. We
may split into smaller groups
following different routines, the
club's activities should be within
everyone's reach. Accommodation is
arranged, of course, in Youth Hostels
and is essentially basic but using a
small hostel hidden in the trees of
Dartmoor Village makes a great
alternative to Linstead Hall or Evelyn
Gardens.
This term we plan to go up to the
moors and dales of Yorkshire, down
to Exmoor and at Easter to Scotland.
The groups are friendly and the
weekend vacations are excellent. So
joining ICYHA may be your chance
to make new friends from all
departments and years. Meet us for
lunch in Southside Upper Lounge,
Thursday, 12.30pm.
John Schofield, Geology 1.
