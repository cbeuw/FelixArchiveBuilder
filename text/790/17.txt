BALLOON CLUB
Are you wondering what this is a
picture of? If so then you now know
what the bottom of our hot-air balloon
looks like!
In 1783 man took to the air in the
first ever 'aircraft'—a hot air balloon
powered by a fire made of burning
straw and twigs! But a month later the
first (hydrogen) gas balloon took off.
In those days it was a much more
practical device than the clumsy and
rather dangerous hot-air balloon (its
design has changed little since). Hot-
air ballooning had died a quick death
and it was not until almost 200 years
later that new materials and modern
technology were used to help generate
and contain hot air. A hot-air balloon
can now be operated at about one per
cent of the cost of that of a gas balloon
and hot-air ballooning has now
become one of the fastest growing air
sports.
One's first balloon flight is a
mixture of fear, appreciation of
beauty and a wonder that the thing
works at all. To float 'out of this
world', away into the clouds and 'ride
the winds' is an experience hard to
explain.
As a club we fly, weather
permitting, most weekends and
throughout the summer. Our local
launch site is down in Newbury (near
Reading) but we also participate in
many balloon meets around the
country where there can often be seen
special shaped balloons (have you
ever seen a flying chateau, Mickey
Mouse, Donald Duck, light bulb, ice
cream cone...to name but a few!).
Everybody is welcome to our
regular Thursday lunchtime meetings
at 1pm in Southside Upper Lounge
(above bar)—just ask around for the
balloon club! It really is a beautiful
sport and surprisingly inexpensive, so
please come and say hello.
Jan Vonka, Chairman.

AMNESTY INT.
The Syrian Campaign is still
Continuing. Please take ten minutes of
your time to write a letter to: Mahmud
al-Zu'bi, Prime Minister, Office of
the Prime Minister, 'Abd al-Rahman
Shahbandar Street, Damascus, Syrian
Arab Republic, concerning this
woman:
Hind Qahwaji, a 31 year old
agricultural engineer from Tal al-Nin,
was first arrested for her membership
of the Party for Communist Action
(PCA) in October 1982. She was
released on March 3 1983 and
rearrested on March 21 1984. Initially
detained in the Military Interrogation
Branch in Damascus, she was tortured
soon after arrest and reportedly
required an operation on her uterus
as a result. She is detained without
charge or trial in Qatana Women's
Prison, south west Damascus. This is
a civil prison but it is used to detain
both political and non-political
prisoners. Hygiene and medical
services in the prison are reported to
be extremely poor. In mid-June 1985
Amnesty International appealed
urgently on behalf of Hind Qahwaji,
who sufferes from asthma, and six
other detained PCA members,
following reports that they were in
poor health and that medical care and
family visits were being denied them.
No response was received from the
Syrian authorities. Hind Qahwaji is
married, and was adopted by AI as
a prisoner of conscience in June 1985.
Please send courteous letters
appealing for her immediate and
unconditional release. Please also
refer to F E L I X issues dated
November 13 1987 and December 4
1987 for more details. If you would
like to know more about Syria and/or
more about Amnesty, feel free to
contact Guy Sims or Monique Yeo
(both Maths 2).
Watch this space for the upcoming
Refugee Campaign!
SCOUT & GUIDE
Last term was a successful one for
S&G, with plenty of events taking
place. There were four weekend
trips—to the Peak District, North
Yorkshire and the Brecon Beaconsfor
walking and climbing and a weekend
'off' barging on the Grand Union
Canal.
In the Peaks, various groups of
walkers went on 'bog-trots' around
Kinder Count, while the climbers
anjoyed a superb day at Froggat
Edge. The party included several
freshers who learnt basic climbing
techniques. Yorkshire saw a partly
successful attempt at the "Three
Peaks' and some rather damp
limestone climbing in Giggleswick
Scar. The Brecon Beacons was an
area the Club had not visitedfor some
time but proved to be a popular
venue. The three main peaks of the
Brecdns were reached and groups
also walked the stretch of the Off a's
Dyke path over the Black Mountains.
The barging weekend was
something else entirely. A constant
battle was waged between the crews
of the two barges—there was plenty
of ammunitionfor use in the shape of
water pistols and buckets. Several
good bridge-hops were also carried
out.
All the weekends were well attended
and thoroughly enjoyed by all
concerned. Several social events took
place during the term, including the
annualpub crawl and restaurant trip.
Over the New Year, we spent a
week in Killion, Central Scotland, for
some winter mountaineering. The lack
of snow put paid to the 'winter' bit,
but despite the foul weather, a total
of nineteen different Munros
(mountains over 3,000ft) were
climbed by various people.
This term, the Club will be going
to Snowdonia and the Lake District
(twice each) for some winter walking
and scrambling and hopefully also
some ice-climbing. We still have room
for some new members, if you are
interested contact Justin Petty (Min
Tech 4) or see us in Southside Upper
Lounge any day except Thursday at
12.30pm. On Thursdays we have
j meetings (slide show and talk) at
! 12.30pm in Mines B303.
