Do we really
control our destiny
or is our fate
mapped out for us?
The very idea that
we are not acting
with total freedom
of will in our lives
is, today, of course
quite ridiculous: but
at the same time
prophecy is still
present apparently
without justification
in our otherwise
advanced world.
Alongside the
scientific predic-
tions of
meteorologists, and
the statistical
forecasts of
analysts, we have
inconsistencies such
as palmistry and
astrology. It would
seem for all our
quest for freedom,
we still cling onto,
and even
encourage, some
element of pre-
destination to our
existence.
NOSTRA
DAMUS
b > v I V I e i r t i n C o l e
While soothsayers specialising in the
study of slaughtered lamb entrails
have little place in modern day
society, astrologists have established
a lucrative little niche for themselves
through the tabloids and various other
publications of similar standing. But
astrology has been around for a long
time, with perhaps its greatest
exponent being one Michel de
Nostradamus—will anyone remember
Russell Grant in 400 years time?
So, who was Nostradamus and why
has he not faded into the same
obscurity of others of his ilk?
Nostradamus was a sixteenth
century French seer (almost
indisputable fact), who predicted
events such as the rise of Napoleon,
Hitler, the assassination of J F
Kennedy and the Ayatollah (absolute
conjecture!). It is of immediate
apparence that his predictions were
characterised by predictions of doom;
and why not? Even the most cursory
study of human history will reveal
that, if we are predictible at all then,
for certain we will go to war, have
evil leaders, and plenty of
assassinations to boot! Predicting
beneficial and U
t
o
p
i
a
n futures is best
left to campaigning politicians and
religious leaders.
So why, having discredited his
predictions, are they still worth
writing about? Well, however his
prophecies are taken, they make an
interesting read, but even better are
the tenuous deductions and
interpretations made by the various
experts; their logic is always
infallible(!).
To make things difficult the
'quatrains', as they are called, are
written in old French rhyme,
collected into ten centuries, each with
100 quatrains (apart from the seventh,
which mysteriously contains only
42—is this the answer to life the
universe and everything?). Unless
you are fluent at French, it is
necessary to rely on official
translations, usually by people only
too willing to further the legend. And,
if this was not enough, the quatrains
are deliberately obscure, ambiguous
and chronologically jumbled: the
explanation being that Nostradamus
did not want to risk prosecution as a
magician—very convenient!
One of the popular themes of
Nostradamus, was the effect of three
brothers on the world, commonly
believed to be a reference to the
Kennedy's and one must concede that
no three brothers have had greater
potential influence on the world
(excluding Andy, Robin and Maurice
Gibb, of course). Nostradamus
'foresaw' their assassinations. Saving
you the French:
