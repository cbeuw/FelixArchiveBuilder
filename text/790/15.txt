Hiccups after
indulgence
New College III—1
IC II—3
After the Christmas festivities, IC
took a while to get back into their
stride. Lethargic at the back, slow in
the midfield, and asleep up front.
However, It was IC who dominated
the first half, on a heavily sanded
pitch, but couldn't turn chances into
goals, only managing to hit the
woodwork twice, and have the ball
cleared off the line. At half-time the
score remained at 0-0. IC started the
second half as slow as the first. New
College then took the lead as IC's
defence stood still. This woke IC up,
and Pip Peel, back from inury, began
to link up with Rob Kelly, to
dominate the midfield. Chris Burton
and Mick Plummer made surging
runs down the wings, and Guy Phiri
and Alan Glass began to work as they
did last term. Russ Dark and Stuart
Miller dominated the the heart of the
defence, and Ian Charlton and Bas
Basma, making their debuts for the
2nds, contributed on midfield. Soon
the equaliser came, with an own goal.
IC surged forward again, hitting the
bar several times, before Alan Glass
forced the ball home in a goal line
scramble. After hitting the bar several
more times, Alan glass ran through
FOOTBALL
over-
again, and his shot was deflected in
by an unfortunate defender. A solid
second half performance, indicated
that IC 2nds are purring again,
hungry for the divisional
championship.
IC 6th-7
Charing Cross & Westminster—1
An emphatic 7-1 victory finally
confirmed the promise this largely
unheard of team has shown
throughout the season. Coming at the
start of this year's campaign it has
immediately resurrected their
promotion hopes.
The goals began within 5 minutes
when a cross from Richard Miles was
cleanly volleyed home by the team's
Scottish ace Cameron Gilmour. The
goals continued throughout the match
with two goals for Aiden Chandler
and Richard Miles and a goal a piece
for A l Bamford and Andy Draine.
The one slight hiccup occurred early
in the second half but should really
be ignored in this fine all round
performance which considerably
brightened' this damp and foggy
afternoon for all in attendance.
HOCKEY
Burton makes the hat-trick
IC 3rds 5
Chalfont St Peter 1
Within seconds the first goal was
produced by the 3rds, a spectacular
goal from Vish Ashiabor slamming
the ball hard against the backboard.
A second goal was made by some
passing around in the D until Steve
Burton managed to get the ball in
followed by another later in the first
half to make the score at half-time 3-0
Almost straight after the whistle for
the second half Hassann Majid hit the
ball into the net, 4-0. Shortly
afterwards the opposition managed to
get their first goal, the keeper came
out to attack the player but he was just
able to sneek the ball in. The final last
minutes saw a final goal by Steve
Burton—A hattrick for him and a jug
for us.
I C - 1
Charing Cross—1
This was not a very memorable
match. Players were lethargic and
unfit after the Christmas break.
Charing Cross began well and quickly
scored one goal. For the rest of the
first half IC had most of the
possession but failed to take the
chances this created to score. IC came
from behind to score a scrappy goal
accredited to Seward. Bettendge
played well at inside forward. The
second half saw Charing Cross
looking much more likely to score.
However good defence from Faldon,
Pownall and Tucker prevented this.
ORIENTEERING
Large amounts
There was a good turn out for the first
event of the term last Sunday, to
Basildon Park, Streetley* This was a
friendly colour-coded event and
despite impaired fitness due to large
:amounts of over-indulgence over the
| Christmas period, all members of the
Club were brave enough to attempt
a hard 'blue' course. All completed
the course with good times, well-up
on the results lists. This shows the
improvement made over the last
couple of years in the overall standard
of orienteering in the Club.
This week's event is a colour-coded
event on Esher Common, see
noticeboard for details, all welcome.
CRICKET
The time has come once more for you
to bleach the grass stains out of your
whites, oil the trusty willow and step
up to the crease. Yes it's the pre-
season nets at Lord's every Tuesday
from 8-9pm. All you have to do is
sign up on the Cricket notice board
outside the Union Bar and meet in the
lobby of Mech Eng at 7pm, equipped
Creasing up
with whites, training shoes, and the
talent of Ian Botham. As always our
first eleven will be packed with
international stars, but there is plenty
of room in the other teams for the rest
of us mortals. So all players are
welcome for a 'mervellous' day's
cricket.
Tony Greenfield.
