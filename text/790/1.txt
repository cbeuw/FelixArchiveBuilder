College will not be able to honour their guarantee of a year in hall
to all first year undergraduates and overseas postgraduates next year,
despite the addition of 200 new places in Evelyn Gardens. According
to figures from the Students Residence Committee and College
Registry, there will again be a shortfall of about one hundred student
places, says Union President Ian Howgate.
Mr Howgate has criticised College
administration for its short-sighted
policy of increasing student numbers
to reduce the College deficit.
He has based his claims on estimates
of next year's student intake made by
College Registrar Peter Mee. Mr Mee
has indicated that undergraduate
numbers must increase by 5% and
postgraduate numbers by 10% to
reach targets. He also says that these
estimates are 'conservative' because
the Governors have set a target of an
extra 100 overseas students, over and
above the increase to pay off the
College's projected £2m deficit. Mr
Howgate says that this means a total
increase of more than 68 freshers and
35 overseas postgraduates needing
College accommodation this October.
A further 26 places will go when
Rayleigh house is sold off this year
to pay for the furnishings for the new
Evelyn Gardens block. 30 places will
be lost in the new Evelyn complex as
subwarden rooms and higher priced
flat accommodation. On top of this 25
places in Evelyn Gardens are to go
altogether.
Adding up the losses and the
projected gains in student numbers
gives a probable deficit of 184 places.
But at the beginning of this year there
were 103 freshers who had, to be
housed in head tenancy flats in
Hamlet Gardens because of the
current short-fall. Mr Howgate told
FELIX that this effectively meant that
over 287 new places were needed to
Bar prices: on the up and up
maintain College's guaranteed place
scheme. Only 200 will have been
gained by taking over the new Evelyn
Gardens building.
This comes as a particular blow to
students who will have to face an
average increase of £7.80 on top of
inflation in their rents over the next
two years. The Union agreed to this
last year, in return for the 200 'extra'
places. Part of the deal was a
temporary reduction in the number of
re-applicant places from 8% to 4% of
places available, which would be
reinstated after a year. The proportion
of re-ap places was cut from 10% to
8% when the Freemantle Hotel was
lost in 1985.
Students may be faced with a
further increase in rents. The
College's Residence Account is
currently £215,000 in debt, £120,000
as a result of the new Evelyn property
being unoccupied for the past year.
Mr Malcolm Aldridge from the
College Finance Section told FELIX
yesterday that this debt will get
steadily worse if rent increases are
held at the rate of inflation. He said
that the only alternative would be to
increase income from the Summer
Letting Scheme (SLS) and the
Summer Accommodation Centre
(SAC). The SLS money, which
comes from letting out Hamlet
Gardens and Evelyn Gardens flats to
students over the long vacations, goes
to the Residence Account. The SAC
. profits, made from conference guests
and casual trade from the Tourist
Board in Linstead and Southside over
Easter and Summer, is currently split
between the Conference Account and
Residence Account.
ICU President Ian Howgate wants
to see all the SAC profits going into
the Residence Account. He said
yesterday that this would give the
Account an extra £100,000 pa.
'Effectively students rents are
subsidising the Conference Account
because the Conference Office pays
less for the 400 rooms than students
do during term-time,' he told us. 'In
return, they are making around £70
per room a week. They're making a
stinking profit out of residences.' He
believes that within two years the
deficit could be completely wiped out.
Mr Aldridge, however, has made
it clear that this can only be done if
the Union is prepared to accept an
increase in bar prices. He explained
that the Conference profits were
needed to pay the interest on a £lm
loan they had secured in order to
refurbish the- Sherfield Main
Refectory. He told FELIX that the
Refectories would have to make
£150,000 each year to cover this and
it was 'obvious to make the money by
increasing beer prices.'
