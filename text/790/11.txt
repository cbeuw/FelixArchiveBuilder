Reggie was born and brought up in
the heart of Northern Ireland which
he describes as 'a very poor but
beautiful place'. His surname is
French, taken over to Ireland by the
Normans, where his family have
remained for generations.
Reggie finished his education in
Dublin, taking a four year course at
the equivalent of a polytechnic which
resulted in a degree in Business
Studies awarded externally by Trinity
College, Dublin. While at college he
spent a year as Public Relations
Officer and so has a good idea of
Student Unions and how they work.
With degree in hand, he set off for
'the bright lights of London' looking
for a job, in true Dick Whittington
style, and became 'graduate assistant'
to a publishing company. Although it
was good experience, the company
was undergoing a reorganisation at
that time, under a new American
manager and Reggie admits that it was
as disaster. The company was cutting
down on its workforce and after a
year he was given six months notice.
Again he quickly found a new job,
working in the City for a small
shipping company. Apparendy it isn't
that difficult to find a job in finance!
After two years, he then decided to
move on again and applied for a job
as the finance worker at the recently
opened London Lesbian & Gay
Centre (LLGC) responsible, with one
other person, for looking after the
accounts for the whole centre. He
admits it was good experience of
'how not to run a business', the centre
which was run as a collective is nuite
large and contains a bar and cafe. One
problem with the job was that he had
to be a 'duty officer' at the Centre two
nights a week, and this was very tiring
when combined with his full-time
work during the day. His job entailed
a great deal of meetings but although
he was working with some 'very good
people' at an interesting place he left
after two and a half years because he
wanted to move on. He left just as the
LLGC was facing an uncertain
financial future as the Local
Government Bill was going through
Parliament. This would, if passed,
prohibit spending on bodies that
'promote homosexuality', and the
main source of funds of the LLGC are
the London Local Authorities.
While at the LLGC he had set up
a new computer system and he feels
this will come in useful for the job at
Imperial. The job for the post of
Financial Officer for IC Union was
advertised in the Guardian and he
applied in November. After a
gruelling interview he was awarded
the job and began in January. This
was the second time that the job had
been advertised; previously the Union
was not able to offer enough money
to attract anybody capable of doing
the job and had negotiated a larger
salary from the College.
He has been stationed in the
refurbished Upper Lounge where, not
only is it very pleasant and quiet but
also has a view of the Albert Hall!
Situated with his new desk and
personal computer, he has started off
on the Snack Bar Accounts, but is
intending to eventually take over all
the financial dealings for the Union
and put them on the computer. The
problem at the moment is that the
College Finance Section audit the
books at the end of the year and,
because of the amount of work they
do, the Union don't get the books
back until half-way through the next
year. This causes great problems as
the Unions' Clubs and Societies do
not know how much money, if any,
is left over at the end of the previous
year until the books are audited, and
it is this 'carryover' money that makes
up the contingency funds for the
following year.
With Reggie working preparing the
accounts, however, the work that the
auditors have to do will be much
reduced and the system will run much
more smoothly. Also, the Union
trading oudets will benefit much from
up-to-date trading accounts, with
week-to-week knowledge of their
trading position.
The job of sorting out the Union
accounts will involve him going
around various parts of the Union to
find out how their finances work and
looking for ways to put them on the
computer. He is looking forward to
this and actually getting out and
meeting 'real students'.
Reggie describes himself as 'shy
and unassuming'. Asked whether he
was efficient, he replied 'Oh God, I
suppose I had better say yes!'. He
describes accountants as 'the most
boring people in the world' but insists
that 'Financial Officers' are different
and are actually 'dynamic'. He hopes
to join in with Union activities and has
a special interest in, believe it or not,
ballroom dancing. He doesn't intend
to sit closetted in his office for the
next two years.
Although he claims to talk too
much, when he found himself
surrounded in the FELIX office, he
became curiously quiet. He was
particularly quiet on the subject of this
year's sabatticals, T haven't been here
long enough to know yet' he claims,
but added 'I'm being a politician'.
He comes across as very warm,
friendly and interesting, not your
typical accountant, 'I'm trying to
break the mould' he claims, 'being an
accountant is a way to get on'. He
would like to move away from
finance eventually, perhaps into
Management or something similar.
As to the future, he intends to stay
with IC Union long enough to set up
the new financial system and then see
what further challenges he can take
on here. He is under no illusions
about what he has taken on, although
he gives the impression that he is
more than equal to them. Despite only
being here for two weeks he has made
a lot of friends and has quickly settled
in.
We wish him luck.

Biggest
G a m b l e
At the start of the 1985/86 session IC
Union staged what was probably the
most successful student boycott to
take place in London this decade. As
a result of this outstanding effort IC
Students' Union took control of the
Union Bar.
This year the Bar Birthday is being
celebrated on January 29, from 8pm,
when the whole Union building is
being taken over for a carnival type
event to be called the Bar Birthday
Ball. Outside of including three
bands: Jim Jiminee, Stagefright and
Chillon, who have all held highly
successful performances at IC
recently, the event sports a 2am bar
extension, beer from 60p a pint from
'8pm to 10pm, a disco and films until
3am, a string quartet in the Union
Bar, jazz piano and a casino.
The casino is without a doubt the
largest revelation to hit a Union event
in years. A ticket to the Ball, costing
only £3.50 in advance and £4 on the
door, entitles you to all the above
events and a programme for the
casino, which provides you with not
only the gaming rules but also a set
number of chips which you can
gamble with at no cost to yourself at
a choice of three tables: Roulette,
Craps and Blackjack. At the end of
the day when all the chips have been
collected in, the top winner will win
one of the £1,400 worth of prizes
generously donated by Capital
Leisure, owners of Third Street
Nightclub and organisers of the
casino. The prizes include the hire of
Third Street Nightclub one weekday
night, at no cost, for your own private
function for up to 200 people; the
Ambassador Suite at Third Street for
a night, for 80 people, for free; a
gallon bottle of red wine; half a case
of house wine and much more
alcohol.
This is your chance to enjoy the
best night out of the year and try your
luck at the tables for next to nothing
whilst the Union subsidises your
evening.
Tickets are on sale from the Union
Office, Union Snack Bar and
departmental reps from next Monday
onwards.
