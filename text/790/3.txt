Paul Shanley makes Rainbow official:
Zippy has no comment.
JCR burger eaters were astonished to
find themselves in the midst of a
UGM on Tuesday. The surprise
meeting caught the entire RSMU
unawares, so that they were unable
to muster even a single representative,
despite the extensive publicity (one
small advert in FELIX).
The meeting got off to a bang with
Chair A l Seymour barking into the
speakers at top volume, churning
stomachs even more than a
McNorthey burger.
Before anyone could even eat a
chip, Beans Club stooge Martyn Peck
moved the meeting on to their motion;
controversial stuff, involving the
adoption of the characters from
Rainbow as new CCU mascots. The
main bone of contention appeared to
be an argument between Captain
Braincell of Guilds and the new look
Clare McErlane (RCS) about who
should get which one. After a bout of
nail biting tension, a solution
emerged—ignore Braincell!
Once this obvious solution had been
adopted the meeting moved on to

lesser issues. ICU President Ian
Howgate had hurt his thumb which
resulted in a far longer spoken report
as he couldn't write anything—this
was greeted by the masses eating then-
burgers with rapt attention...
Obviously not a fan of corny
headlines like 'Hamlet House of
Horror', Ian made the shock
pronouncement that 'we should get
rid of the head tenancies'. Not content
with this he felt that ICU External
Affairs Officer Neil Motteram should
also be given the chop. Ian protested
that Neil hadn't done anything for a
term and didn't even attend the GUC
meetings which his job decription
demanded. Poor old Neil was no-
confidenced for the second time and
thus lost his post. Where will it all
lead to—will other Union officers be
expected to do work as well? What
a tyrant Mr Howgate is!
together with a rumour about bai
price rises. Watch this space for earth-
shattering up-dates about the latter.
Good of Cosmic Dave Clements
got in a plug about SCC and Chas
Brereton managed a little free
publicity for his forthcoming election
campaign, by complaining about the
Academic Affairs Committee.
However, they could not compete
iwith the hard-sell tactics of
Publications Board Chair Chris
Martin plugging FELIX's new
photocopier, resplendent with—
gasp—blue and red colours!!!
Ever keen to promote inter-CCU
rivalry, new Rag Mag Editors Dave
Williams (RCSU Hon Junior
Treasurer) and Gail Turner (RCSU
Publicity Officer) managed to get a
dig at both the Print Union and
Guildsheet at once, by describing it
as being printed on bog roll. Tactful,
More reports followed, including a
proposed shift of the sabbatical year,
with the handover date moving from
the end of June to the end of July ('ask
other unions what waiting sabbaticals
do before taking over', said comrade
Jackson; we suspect it involves the
generosity of the DHSS—or a holiday
in the Bahamas).
Alan Rose revealed some
interesting news about toilets,
as they want their Rag Mag printed
chez FELIX! .
A huge sigh of relief was expelled
by UGM Chair Alistair Seymour as
he closed the meeting at 1.45pm, the
shortest and first completed meeting
within living memory—well, for
several months at least.
Union watchers are now eagerly
awaiting the publicity for the next
UGM. Don't hold your breath!
