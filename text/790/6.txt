Hi, everyone! Just a quick note to
assure you all I have survived the
holiday intact. I have a couple of
interesting bits of news for you.
1. We should have an official
Society (SLAGS—Society for Lesbian
And Gay Students) after next Council
meeting!
2.1 am now helping to run the ULU
Lesbian & Gay Group, meeting
Thursdays at 7.30pm in Room 2e at
ULU (Russell Square tube). Come
along it's good fun and no one at IC
need know where you're going if you
don't want them to.
3. Clause 28 of the Local
Government Bill. I will write more
on this subject very soon. This is a
severe attack on the rights of local
government councils to provide help
and support to gay and lesbian people.
Contact me if you want more
information.
As a final bit—just wanted to tell
everyone about my New Year's
resolutions! I resolved to eat anything
fattening that caught my eye (watch
my waistline), only to go to lectures
if I really felt like it, to go to a
nightclub at least once a week and to
sleep with anyone I met whom I
fancied (everyone thinks I do anyway
so I might as well enjoy myself!). I've
managed to keep all my resolutions
so far this year! Let's hope I can keep
it up!

Lesbian & Gay Welfare Officer.

What do you feel about the
accommodation that you are living in?
Wouldn't you have liked to know
what it was really like before you
arrived here? I would like to hear all
you have to say about your present
or past housing so as to pass it on to
future students and perhaps pass some
on to FELIX. I would also like to hear
your views on the CCUs, IC Union
and your courses. This is your chance
to get your views across to the
College. It's not just freshers who
read the AP!
Martyn Peck,
Alternative Prospectus Editor.
Q: What's bi-
sexual, fat and thin
and has four legs?
Hold on to your towels everyone
because Rag Committee has finally
done it. They've lit the blue touch
paper, taken a step into the unknown,
pressed the red button, pushed the
stone over the precipice, etc and ad
nauseum...
The new Rag Mag editor is
remarkably schizophrenic, known
generally as Gail Turner and David
Williams or David Williams and Gail
Turner (it depends whose talking), we
are funny, intelligent, witty and
desperate for input from you. We
want jokes, big jokes, small jokes,
WASP jokes, JAP jokes, any jokes
at all. No one need be safe, write
them down and leave them in the IC
Office, the RCS Office, the Physics
pigeonholes or stop us in the street,
in the bar, just about anywhere but
in the bath. (Dave would even
welcome you in the bath if you're fit
and female but you might see a joke
Rag Mag: you '11 Dai laughing!

bigger than the whole Rag Mag—
Gail.) This year, for various reasons
we are changing the size of the Rag
Mag to A4, if you object strongly
write and tell us and we may change
our minds. As we are editors of
quality we don't intend to reduce the
number of pages so we still need
twice as much material. Witty poems,
current affairs, cartoons, captioned
photos, stories and crosswords will all
be greatly appreciated and as we may
be running competitions in future
issues of FELIX, get your thinking
caps on.
So now you've got the idea we will
wait in anticipation for the flood of
response. Whether you've loved or
hated past IC Rag Mags you now have
the chance to change this year's. Only
the funniest jokes will go in. Send us
your jokes and make this year's Rag
Mag the best ever.
Gail & Dave.
It is apparent throughout the Medical
School that Rag has finally come to
town. Posters are up such that one
really would have to be blind to miss
the fact that Rag is here!
The behind the scenes work in
organisation is in full stride, after a
late start. It is amusing to enter the
SU Office and see someone
attempting to negotiate 'a good deal'
on borrowing an anaconda and some
chimps from London Zoo for the
breakfast party on Paddington Station
on the morning of Wednesday March
2nd, the traditional start to Rag Week.
This year the chosen beneficiary is
the 'Tuberous Sclerosis Association
of Great Britain' which has been more
than helpful about the whole event.
While one realises that the St Mary's
Rag Week is not on the same scale
as IC's, it occupies an important part
in student life here and it would be
a great pity if it were to be swallowed
up in the merger.
This year we are attempting to
create a public spectacle in the hope
that a great public involvement will
lead to more money raised. Events
include a band in Hyde Park
(hopefully) on Sunday 6th, a Paris
Dash, and a general 'make fools of;
yourselves and collect lots of money
afternoon' on Wednesday 2nd. With
a little luck and a few celebrities,
media involvement may be'
considerable, leading to more;
MONEY!
So when 'That Week In March'
comes around once more, look out for
the raving loonies roaming the streets
of London rattling collection boxes
and please do contribute, as it will
help to cement relationships that are
essential for the future well-being of
the College.
