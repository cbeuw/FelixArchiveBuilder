Highlight of this week should prove
to be The Triffids at the Astoria
tomorrow night. Adequate
descriptions of this band—
'interesting' and 'Australian' hardly
suffice—are hard to come by. Their
repertoire covers a wide range of
styles largely dominated by indie pop-
rock with a psychedelic touch. They
are on the way up so catch them now
before ticket prices go way above
student budgets.
Echo and the Bunnymen continue
to go through the motions at Brixton
Academy on Saturday. In recent years
the Bunnies seem to have lost interest
in their music, displaying little
imagination on their last album (the
name: Echo and the Bunnymen—how
did they come up with that one?) and
with minimal live performances. Still,
at Brixton you have no problem with
seats and can enjoy the music even if
the visuals are less than inspiring.
Another week and another round of
league games with a couple of big
guns in town. All games take place
on Saturday January 23 at 3pm
(unless otherwise stated).
Charlton vs Liverpool
Selhurst Park (Norwood Junction BR)
A real bottom versus top with the
Reds having triple the amount of
points as the luckless valiants.
Charlton are showing signs of a
revival and earned a point at
Nottingham Forest last week, Andy
Jones being the hero for the day. It
has all been written about Liverpool
this season and 23 league games
without defeat (18 wins) speaks for
itself. It is their method that disgusts
me. They buy and buy until they have
all the best players, how can the other
teams fight that. I admit that John
Barnes, Peter Beardsley et al are
proving to be brilliant, but if Charlton
can beat them I will be over-joyed.
I will stick my neck out and say that
they can do it. A victory for the
minnows over money.
Also tomorrow are Imperial
College's Purple People Eaters,
Doors influenced 60s and 70s
psychedelia. See them plus their light
show featuring oil projections,
prisms, slides and strobes for FREE
in the Union Bar.
MUSIC
by Phil Young
Gig Review: Pop Will Eat Itself,
Friday Jan 15, ULU. There were
hundreds of them, leathered and long
haired young ladies and gentlemen,
piled six deep in the bars, lying
bombed out of their heads on god-
knows-what on the stairs and
wandering aimlessly around outside
after the gig was pronounced 'sold
out'. Greboes, goths, headbangers,
hip-hop fans, psychobillies and
hippies waiting for the band who are
what the Beastie Boys will never be.
Chelsea vs Portsmouth
Stamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)
A match between two teams in the
bottom half of Division One, two
teams with no real form, does not
seem to offer much for a neutral
spectator. Chelsea are unbeaten at
home but are eleven games without
a league win. Portsmouth have
brought into the division a mixture of
disgraceful behaviour both on the
field and off, a dictator chairman and
a moaning manager in Alan Ball.
New captain Noel Blake has put a
little more iron into Pompey though,
and they are playing a little better.
Stamford Bridge is an awful ground
for a terrace spectator, you are miles
from the pitch, and with teams that
possess such unruly 'fans', I would
keep away from this one. A 0-0 draw
is the sort of result to expect, though
Pompey could snatch it with a little
luck.
Leyton Orient vs Stockport
Brisbane Rd (Leyton tube)
Orient only drew last week thanks to
a 90th minute goal, a disappointing
result for manager Frank Clark who
has moulded a good side into a
promotion winning outfit, fit to take
on Forest next week. Stockport have
veteran Asa Hartford and managed a
draw against table-topping Wolves
last week. I expect Orient to win
comfortably.
FOOTBALL
by Adrian Grainger
Game of the day:
Charlton vs Liverpool
Pop Will Eat Itself arrive on cue,
opening with a low deep drum beat
and grinding guitars, all done on
backing-box. For the first song or two
it appears that this band go for power j
at the expense of all imagination and
talent, but you know it's all a piss-
take, a chance to shout and stomp and
go totally mindless. The songs are so
offensive that they become
inoffensive. Still, half an hour was
long enough to get the point; every
subsequent minute was wasted. The
attitude of the night was summed up
by the slogan on the t-shirt of one of
the band: 'The Poppies are crap'. A
joke, a bit of a laugh but not to be
risked too often.
Arsenal vs Manchester Utd
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
This is the live game on TV on
Sunday and although it features two
of the top five, a series of 0-0 draws
in the past overshaddows the game. -
2-0 defeats for both teams last week
virtually ended their championship
asperations. Arsenal can be exciting:
at times and Alan Smith, David
Rocastle and Niall Quinn produce
flair up front. United are having a
good season with McClair providing
a punch in the attack that has been
missing before. Bryan Robson has led
his team well this year but I think that
the Gunners will take the 3 points.
This will be a good game for the
partizans but the neutral would be
better staying at home this time.
Fulham vs Chester
Craven Cottage (Putney Bridge tube)
Both of these middle of the table
teams lost their third division games
last week by 2-1 and there aren't any
pointers to show that this will be a
game to see. Crowds of less than
4,000 will look empty at the ground,:
so I would give this one a miss.
Fulham to win.
