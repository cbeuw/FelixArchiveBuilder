SAILING
T e a m first
despite no
wind
Last Saturday, a team from IC sailed
against teams from Sheffield
University. Although the wind was
virtually non-existent, we managed to
sail three races during the day. A
good result was achieved by IC,
despite having to sail with no team
captain.
Two races were sailed against
Sheffield Men's team in the morning,
both were won convincingly by IC.
After lunch, the wind had dropped
even more and so only one race was
sailed, against Sheffield Ladies' team.
Until the last leg things looked bad
for IC in this race, with first, fifth and
sixth places. However, IC sailed well
as a team and pulled through to finish
first, second and third.

H O C K E Y
IC Ladies—8
St Thomas Hospital II—1
IC, with a seriously reduced side,
were expecting a tough match. This
was not to be. In her opening game
for IC ladies J Houlden scored the
first goal of the match. Blair played
well in midfield and was rewarded
with a goal. Jackson scored another
goal from a short corner. This leaves
Ottway who played well as the
forward line to eventually score five
goals. Somewhere in this mass of
goals St Thomas managed to get into
IC's half and score.
IC lsts—2
UCL lsts—2 (UL League)
IC lsts-1
Reading 3rds—2 (Friendly)
IC Hockey lsts started this term as
they did the last, badly. Still floating
on their Indian gymkhana cloud, the
men restarted against U C L on the
astroturf at Paddington. As a general
rule, IC either score or concede a goal
in the first two minutes of every
match. On Wednesday it was IC's
turn to score first through a
Vamadevan-Collman short corner:
routine. Still following the game plan,
L i m p and clumsy
after ten minutes of good play, IC
came off the throttle and let UCL back
in. Limp and clumsy tackling caused
a spate of defending short corners
which rewarded UCL with a farcical
goal. In a short corner switch, the
defenders all ran to the right, the ball
went left and in. In the second half
IC continued to play sporadically.
Colin Wright struggled in his first
game back from injury and Gary
Knaresborough looked out of position
at inside left. Justin Brooking ran
hard, but was rarely in the middle of
the field to marshall IC's play. The
outstanding performance of the day
was by Jon Stonham who, covering
for an uncharacteristically indecisive
Jim Garside, was hard and clinical in
the heart of defence. Against the play
UCL won and converted a penalty
flick. Their lead was to be short lived.
Paul Skipworth, beating four players,
equalised with a brilliant individual
goal. However, he and Vamadevan
missed 'sitters' in the closing minutes
as IC struggled to improve the
scoreline. The drawn result means
dropped points for the lsts in a league
that they should retain.
