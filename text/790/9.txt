'Then for the great brothers, death
and dissension.'
Well, of course JFK and Robert
duly obliged, but Edward seems to be
proving a little stubborn:
Nostradamus goes on to elucidate:
'The great man will be struck down
in the day by a thunderbold.. .another
falls at night time.'
With a further reference to the
death of three brothers and 'lightning
on top'. The thunderbolt is seen by
commentators as a medieval
impression of a bullet. JFK was
indeed shot in broad daylight, by Lee
Harvey Oswold, from the top of a
building in Dallas, 1963. Robert was
shot nearly five years later, at night,
while celebrating a presidential
primary election victory. But all these
links between various of his 942
quatrains have been made by those
keen to find some meaning to
Nostradamus words.
Hitler apparently saw himself in
Nostradamus' predictions, he and Dr
Goebbels using them for propaganda.
In the quatrains, reference to
'Hister'—before the 1930s this was
taken as being the Danube river, as
this is 'Ister' in Latin, but 'Hitler'
does give the quatrains more
relevance (well relatively, at least).
Nostradamus talks in context of,
- '...the child of Germany observes
no law'
and,
'In the deepest part of western
Europe a child will be born of poor
family who by his speech will entice
many peoples.'
but, perhaps more specifically,
'Near the Rhine from the Norican
mountains will be born a great man
of the peoples come too late. He will
defend Poland and Hungary and they
will never know what became of
him.'
Hitler was indeed, born of humble
beginnings in Norican, Austria, and
was also a great orator. He invaded
Poland and Hungary to save' them
from the Allies—defensive? And, of
course, the ultimate final teaser—did
he really die in the bunker in Berlin?
Admittedly some of this is intriguing,
but it does seem that if you look hard
enough you will find something of
relevance, however tenuous.
Nostradamus' style lends itself well
to free-interpretation, especially if
adjusted in translation.
But enough of the distant past, what
is there of a more topical nature? Well
how about this,
'The Libyan Prince will be
powerful in the West, the French will
become so enamoured of Arabia.'
The Libyan Prince? Well, quite
obviously Colonel Gadaffi; at least
he'd like to think he was powerful in
the West. But what about the French
affection for Arabs? Could it be the
release of the Iranian envoy, believed
to be involved with the Paris
bombings, in exchange for French
hostages in the Lebanon?
Wait, this one's even better,
'The Arab Prince, Mars, the Sun,
Venus and Leo, the rule of the Church
will succumb to the sea, towards
Persia...
The conjunction of Mars, the Sun
and Venus occured on August 21,
1987—the height of the Gulf War and
the navies of Christendom even get
a mention and a reference to Leo/lion
does of course refer to the Royal
Navy escorting re-flagged
tankers—obviously!
Now to the future, no surprises
here, it is a prediction of gloom, but
with a specific date. I hope you're
ready for this;
'In the year 1999, and seven
months from the sky will come the
great King of Terror. He will bring
back to life the great king of the
mongols. Before and after war reigns
happily.
On a lighter note, there is even a
previously unattributed quatrain
making clear reference to Imperial,
'Near to the port with no sea, The
fields of friendly battle shall yield
three-fold riches from the very earth.
Ani shall be contented.'
A port with no sea—an airport! But
a friendly battle is a clear
contradiction, unless it could be sport
(in principle at least). So a sports field
near an airport; Harlington is near
Heathrow! Riches from the ground-
it must be the Harlington gravel—£3
million. But who or what is 'Ani'—a
difficult one for any student of
Nostradamus, but could it be a
devious anagram of Ian—a happy
Union president?!! This beats solving
3-2-1 clues!
But, what's this? Century VI,
Quatrain 100;
'Incantation of the Law Against
Inept Critics...'
Linda Simmons, College We
with advice to all overseas
L e a v e t o r e m a i n
Renewing your leave to
remain in the UK
It is only possible to renew your leave
to remain through the College in
September and October each year.
Any notices still up in College
advertising this service are out of date
and shoud be taken down. I'm sorry
if they have misled any students who
have read them.
Remember. The golden rule when
attempting to get leave to remain
extended is to apply before the expiry
date. Even when the College scheme
is in operation, we are unable to
accept applications from students
whose leave to remain has already
expired. However, I will always try
to help students in this situation,
although the College has no special
resources to guarantee that a late
application will be successful. As
soon as you overstay your leave to
remain, even if it is by only one day,
you are in breach of the Immigration
Rules (ie you are an Overstayer) and
thus lose your right to appeal against
any refusal to renew your right to
remain in the UK.
Home Office Backlog
Due to an overwhelming number of
applications for registration for
citizenship, the Home Office case
work division now has a huge backlog
of work. This means that written
applications to the Home Office are
taking about six weeks before the
envelope is opened and up to three
months before the enquiry is
answered.
Similarly, people applying in
person at Croydon are facing queues
of up to 8 or 10 hours. As there are
no eating facilities in the Public
Enquiry Office, I should take some
sandwiches and coffee!
Greek Students
From 1st January 1988, Greece
became a full member of the EEC.
This means that like other EEC
Students, Greek students are now able
to work part-time and study part-time
if they wish. It also appears that they
should be able to claim Housing
Benefit, although the situation
regarding EEC students and Housing
Benefit is unclear at the moment and
anyone in doubt should check with me
before claiming.
Any Greek student who has
restrictions stamped in their passports
who would like them removed,
should write (recorded delivery) to
the Home Office requesting that their
leave be changed to that of an EEC
national. But wait until the end of
January before applying, in order to
let the backlog of work described
above die down.
Extended Leave to Remain
It is stated Home Office policy to give
genuine overseas students three years
leave to remain if they apply at the
beginning of a three year course.
However, it does appear that this
is not happening in practice.
UKCOSA (The United Kingdom
Council for Overseas Students
Affairs) recommends that all overseas
students who have only one year's
leave to remain, but whose course is
longer and wish to extend their
permission, should write (recorded
delivery) to the Home Office
requesting an extension of their
present leave to cover the duration of
the course. You should, of course,
submit all the usual evidence.
In order to see if the Home Office
are carrying out their officially stated
policy, I would be most grateful if
those students who do apply would let
me know how they get on especially
1
if they are refused, as UKCOSA have
stated that they will do everything
they can to help students in this
situation.
If you need help' or information on
any of the above topics or almost
anything else, you canfind me on the
1st Floor, 15 Princes Gardens,
Monday to Friday, 10am-2.30pm,
ext 3604.
