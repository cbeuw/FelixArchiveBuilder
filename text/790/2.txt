F E L I X
I would be interested in receiving any
opinions about student travel
companies, good or bad stories of
disastrous holidays, especially Inter-
Railing or BUNAC stories. Please
take the time to pass on your tips or
views to other students who are
considering similar holidays this year,
preferably by giving me copy next
Monday.
Finally
There's a staff meeting today. Thank
you to all the new staff members who
turned up to help this week.
I must congratulate John Noble, ICU
Entertainments Officer, on a brilliant
Carnival 88 last Friday. It seems that
the poor man can't do a thing wrong.
I must say that I was a little dubious
when I heard that he had been ratified
to the post last year. My only dealings
with him had been as part of the
audience watching his".ex-band Blue
Blue Ice. It was easy to think of him
as just another 'haircut' who wanted
the post for his street cred._Since then
I have been amazed by the amount of
genuine hard work he has put into the
job and how, with the help of a strong
Ents team, he has brought IC Ents out
of the doldrums.
Bar Birthday Ball
Originally Ian's wacky birthday
party, this has turned into a full-blown
Union celebration. There's a
featurette about the event on page 11.
You have absolutely no excuse for
missing such a value-for-money
evening.
Snack Bar
They're absolutely desperate for staff.
Please" see Mark today if you want to •
earn £2 ph during the morning.
Next Week
We are planning a student travel
feature section for next week's issue.
