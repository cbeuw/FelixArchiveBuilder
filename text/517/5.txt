official Soviet feature news agency with
London offices at Rosary Gardens in South
Kensington.

Durham University president elect stands
down
Durham Student Union president elect,
Chris Johnson, resigned last week. Criticism
of Mr Johnson started after a 'highly
controversial performance' at N U S
Conference.
T h e D u r h a m s t u d e n t ' s n e w s p a p e r ,
Palatinate, describes how a motion to D S U
Council moved that Mr Johnson should be
censured giving the following reasons.
(1) He cast his vote for a 'joke' candidate in
the elections for a sabbatical treasurer in
NUS.
(2) He persuaded the delegation to instigate
an Emergency motion which, it transpired,
was inaccurate and even slanderous to
another student.
(3) He missed the last session of the
conference in Blackpool without informing
other members of the delegation.
Mr Johnson's supporters state that 'Chris
stood for President in the belief that what the
President did should always be relevant to the
ordinary student, that student unions often
take themselves too seriously and consider
themselves to be more important than they
actually are and he felt it important to rise
above all the petty political squabbles that
don't benefit anybody but waste a lot of time'.
