IC IV 5 v 1 Goldsmiths III
C a n Anyone Stop Rowley?
People say that games are won and lost i n midfield, but
unless a team has a reliable goal-scorer, midfield control goes
to waste. However when a team possesses such a lethal
m a r k s m a n as James Rowley the normally exhausting tasks in
a game become a pleasure.
Thus it was with great confidence that IC IV faced this top of the
tabic clash against league leaders Goldsmiths III. Even 'preacher of
doom' Bill CafTyn was forced to admit before the game that given the
right conditions we might actually win. When the rest ofthe team heard
that Bill had given the ok, confidence reached a peak.
So it was that the full strength IC team took the pitch against the
team that had beaten them 4-0 earlier in the season (to work up some
aggression Bill CafTyn told some jokes before the game).
James Rowley went close very early on when he stole between two
defenders only to be foiled by an excellent reflex save by the Goldsmiths
goalkeeper. Minutes later O'Kelly outsmarted the opposition's right
back and his cross (somehow) found John Shuttleworth (FELIX Editor
elect) who scored easily. Another O'Kelly pass was measured into
Rowleys path and he made no mistake when he rounded the keeper and
slotted the ball in.
The third goal came when a
Goldsmith's goal kick went
straight to Rowley who volleyed
the ball past the shocked goalie
from 30 yards. This goal typifies
the quick thinking and excellent
control which is such a large part
of Rowley's vital contribution to
the team.
Rowley finished his first half
hat-trick after some good work in
left midfield by recent acquisition
Glen Millar. From a corner
Goldsmiths snatched a late first
half goal that even the athletic
goalkeeper Witts [joint IC
footballer of the year) failed to
stop.
J u s t b e f o r e h a l f - t i m e
Shuttleworth (injured in a tackle)
was replaced by Nick Matthews
whose positive and decisive runs
were at the centre of many ofthe
second half attacks.
In the solid IC defense, Steve
Veats returning to his natural
position as centre half, was most
noticeably in control,particularly
in the air against a swilling w ind
and the Goldsmith's attack (in
that order).
Despite their near total control
and with the help of goal shy
O'Kelly and Marten, IC added
only one goal in the second half
when a good combination of
Matthews and Rake put Rowley
through for his fourth.
So Imperial came out victors by
5-1, a scoreline which in no way
flattered them, in particular on
their first half performance.This
was the teams 8th win the last 10
games, scoring 47 goals in the'
process. James Rowley has now
scored 20 league goals in his
season's total of 39! A point of
interest is that player-manager
Okelly would not deny that Brian
Clough had been in touch about a
possible James Rowley - Trevor
Francis swap. He did however ask
to be quoted when he said. James
Rowley Is an IC I]' player. This
situation will continue until Ihe end oj
the season. After that we are open lo
offers.

IC IV 2 v 1 RHC III
F o u r t h s out-witt H o l l o w a y
With a masterful display of goalkeeping agility, Barry Witts
played perhaps his best game of the season to help IC IV to
victory by 2-1 against R H C III. T h e co-holder ofthe M a n h e i m
trophy was called upon onmany occasions tomake brave saves
from the onrushing R H C forwards, and he was not found
wanting!
T h e day started with the u s u a l h a g g l i n g over players in the
U n i o n l o u n g e . E x p e r i e n c e d m a n a g e r O ' K e l l y t h o u g h t

the ball firmly into the c o r n e r of the net.
T h e n there was a sudden sharp
change in the weather causing
painful sheets of sleet to be driven
toward the I C goalmouth. This
p r o d u c e d a l m o s t c o n s t a n t
pressure on the I C defence for the
rest of the half since the I C
forwards found it difficult to run
into the sleet without closing their
eyes (though some would claim
that the 'les yeux fermes'
technique is an essential feature of
their play anyway!)
H a v i n g survived the first half
with a 1-0 lead, I C were
desappointed to find that the
wind had died down so that
Holloway were not faced with any
meteorological problems in the
second half. However in the first
20 minutes of this half. IC played
their best football and after
Hanke. M i l l a r . O ' K e l l y and

Balliol College, Oxford
180 for 6 declared
For a match due to begin at 2.15, 2.00 arrived and found only 9 IC
players at Balliol and Just 1 member of the Oxford team. The four latest
arrivals from IC therefore wisely elected to sample the local
Brakespears and less local Wadworths. At 2.30 all of both teams were
present, Maqulre and Salter having caught a stopping train from
Paddington.
IC won the toss and having barely examined the wicket but closely
examined the batting line-up, Balliol were asked to bat.
Salter was conned into acting as wicket keeper for the day and spent
half the afternoon re-enacting a stumping once performed when he was
16; unfortunately whilst the batsman's feet were firmly in the crease.
Despite the odd extraneous appeal from the slips it wasn't until the
Oxford College were 98 without loss that a half-hearted question from
Bunten received a dubious Ibw decision to remove one of the openers.
Balliol now pressed on more quickly, and IC did well, with a bowling
attack mainly from Care and Wyatt, who took 2 wickets each, and sharp
outfielding to contain the opposition to 180 for 6 when the declaration
came.
Imperial College 2nd XI 60 for 7
Match Drawn.
IC had 55 minutes plus 20 overs to reach the target, and never really
had a chance to chase the total, losing opener Smith, unluckily to
another dubious decision, in the 3rd over. Uncharacteristically Furnish
had scored 9 when the IC total was on 9, but then managed to avoid a
straight ball on middle stump, so that he could do some umpiring. More
IC wickets fell quickly, but some solid batting from Bunten and Wyatt,
and later Maguire, saw IC through to the close.
In the bar we congratulated ourselves on allowing 2 opposition
players to score 50, and another to take 5 wickets, as this gave them the
privilege of each buying a jug of their excellent Hook Norton brew.
We finally left by British Rail and car between 9.00 and 10.30, when
Care, Wyatt and Bunten proved how hard they had played by failing to
raise enough energy to push start the captain's car, so that he was
forced to use the subtle method of cleaning the spark plugs.
