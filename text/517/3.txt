Rent Increases
I was pleased to see that a long-term (70 year) lease for
all the Evelyn Gardens student houses has been bought.
Admittedly the twenty-two per cent rent rise w i l l come as a
shock to most, but it's worth it for the advantages in the
long run.
Ken Weale, the Union Senior Treasurer, has pointed out
that if the short-term lease had been bought instead then
the resultant increase in ground rent would still have to be
paid for. Either way the rents would go up, but this way IC
hangs onto E v e l y n Gardens for another 70 years.
Meet IC Day
Rumours abound as to the cost of "Meet Imperial C o l l -
ege". Fortunately the often-quoted figure of £70,000 was
totally inaccurate, the final figure being about £1500. With
200 guests in a l l I'm sure that relations between us and the
residents w i l l have been improved.
It does seem a pity, though, that very few students had a
chance to visit the displays or see the Sherfield Building
decked with flowers. A one-afternoon event does not do
justice to the effort and hard work put in by the staff. Per-
haps if it had lasted longer more residents would have been
able to come and more students could have appreciated the
wide range of academic/recreational facilities IC has to
offer.
F E L I X Election
At last! A contested post for Photographic Rep on the
Committee. The election will be held at 12.30 in the F E L I X
Office today." A l l members are urged to attend and vote.
ICU Handbook
The copy deadline for all articles for next year's Hand-
book is June 10th. A l l clubs and societies, Union Officers
etc who have something to say to next year's intake should
have their copy (typed please) in by then at the very latest.
What a week!
May 7th to 10th must easily rate as the worst week I've
ever had. Not only did the bank holiday put us one day be-
hind schedule but things grew steadily worse, culminiating
in the self-destruction of the Comp Set late Wednesday
night. Many thanks to A M International for their speedy ser-
vice. No thanks to Simon (when do I get a mention) Milner
for starting the rumours about Mel K i n k i e and myself. We're
just good friends. Cheers,
John
NEWS IN BRIEF
More Opposition To Quotas
The University of London's
Joint Committee of Senate and
the Students Representative
C o u n c i l has come out against
any quotas on overseas student
numbers. The Committee is
opposed to any limits on
academic freedom and upholds
the university's right to decide
admission.
In 1981 students w i l l be r e -
presented on London Univer-
s i t y ' s Senate by the University
Of London Union President and
ten student senators, s i x of
whom w i l l be faculty represent-
atives. The Joint Committee
has agreed to increase the num-
ber of its own student members
from five to six and these are
to be elected as faculty repre-
senatives as a "dummy r u n "
for 1981. This procedure is sub-
ject to agreement by the U L U
S t u d e n t s Representative
C o u n c i l .
No Opposition To Massive Rent Rise
An expected 22 per cent rent rise in h a l l s and student houses
has provoked no objections from Union Officers or ordinary
students.
A t last Tuesday's Union meeting President Mary Attenbor-
ough outlined the proposal which would increase Southside rents
to £14.00 per week from £11.50.
She explained that the r i s e , which is greater than an inflation
increase, is necessary to start repayment of a £670,000 loan made
to the Student Residence A c c o u n t from College funds.
The loan is for the purchase of the 70 year lease on a l l the
student houses in E v e l y n Gardens as w e l l as on three extra
houses to be available in about seven years. The present lease
was due to lapse next year and would otherwise have only been re-
newable for seven years. The interest rate on the loan is 10 per
cent and it is to be repaid over 35 years.
Mary Attenborough's view is that College is acting to safeguard
future student residence, a line which the Union has been urging
for a long time. Although the rent rise is large she is in favour of
its acceptance, and believes that if this purchase goes ahead
College w i l l be favourably disposed to making more money a v a i l -
able for accommodation should any further property in E v e l y n
Gardens come onto the market.
The rise is not as large as was first mooted. C o l l e g e ' s F i n a n c e
Office earlier asked for a 27 per cent rise based on maintaining
Residence Account reserve funds at a level of 10 per cent of ex-
penditure. The present rate reduces the reserves to about 7 per
cent.
Mary Attenborough is waiting for further student reaction before
informing College of the U n i o n ' s considered v i e w .
Good Response From Residents
The Rector has received about 30 letters so far from l o c a l
residents who came to l a s t week's " M e e t I C " day saying how much
they enjoyed the afternoon. Captain L i n d l e y who organised the
event is very pleased with the response. He hopes the College
can maintain the initiative and consolidate the contacts made with
local residents. But College has not decided whether to organise
similar events in future years.
The cost of " M e e t I C " was about £1,500, of which the largest
single item was catering. The organisers tried to save money by
producing much of the material within C o l l e g e .
The final total of guests was around 200, several of whom
arrived later in the afternoon. The figure of 130 quoted in last
week's F E L I X was the number who had arrived in the first hour.
