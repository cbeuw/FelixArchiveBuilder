NEWS IN BRIEF
Jez Threats Anger Executive
Students from Queen Mary
College sprayed blue paint over
the two lions at the foot of the
Queen's Tower last Sunday
Morning.
And on Tuesday I C Union
received a threat that J e z w a s
" n e x t on the l i s t " .
The threat came in a letter
composed of words cut from
newspapers. It read: " M a r y
roars back at her o l d friends.
L o o k after your fire engine.
Next on the list? We w i l l w i n
in the long r u n " . M a r y is Q M C ' s
mascot, kidnapped by I C stud-
ents earlier this year.
Executive members were
furious because J e z , the R C S U
fire engine, is an inviolate
mascot. Deputy President
Malcolm Brain told a Union
meeting that he would report to
the police any attacks on J e z .
R C S U President Chris F o x
visited Q M C Union on Tuesday
afternoon and spoke to their
V i c e President N i g e l Woodcock.
He explained which of I C ' s
mascots could be raided and
which were inviolate, and i n -
formed h i m that any action
against J e z would be regarded
as criminal. N i g e l Woodcock
said that he would look into
the matter and consider making
a contribution to the cleaning
of the lions.
This is the second time this
year that the lions have been
painted. On 8th December they
were found covered in red paint
which was removed by College
workmen before it had a chance
to dry.
News in Brief continued on
back page.
It is now possible to remove a Departmental Representative from
office. The By-Law change had its second hearing at last Tuesday's
UGM. To dismiss a Dep Rep it is necessary to draw up a petition with at
least 10% support from that department and present this to the Hon Sec
of ICU who will then call a general meeting of the department where a
discussion will be followed by a ballot.
This change was necessary because there was previously no method
of ousting Dep Reps from their posts.
Also past its second reading was a clause stating that the U L U Rep,
FELIX Editor and Union Publicity Officer should be permanent
observers on Council.
Some confusion reigned over
Jeremy Farrell's amendment to
the Standing Orders. This was in
fact designed to clarify previous
amendments to the standing
orders.
The original changes con-
cerned the right to speak for and
against procedural motions but
was not clearly worded and this
a m e n d m e n t w a s a i m e d at
rectifying the situation.
The proposed change was
eventually w i t h d r a w n to be
â€¢discussed at a later date.
Only six people stood for P W P
so no election was required and
Mike Elkin must surely be
d i s a p p o i n t e d at m i s s i n g an
opportunity to demonstrate his
skill with STV. The six ratified
were Gary Dearmer, Mick Berry,
Mark Clegg, Tansy Hepton, David
Lyons and Colin Palmer.
John Passmore was ratified as
External Affairs Officer for the rest
of this session.
Tim Hillyer was elected at the
U G M by a show of hands, in
preference to the absent lain
Shacklock, and will be joined on
the E A C by Kevin Courtney,
ratified as Ordinary Member.
N o c a n d i d a t e s were fully
nominated for Union Finance
C o m m i t t e e , U n i o n P u b l i c i t y
Officer and the Publicity Officer of
the External Affairs Committee.
The one ballot taken was for
Union House Committee where
four candidates were contesting
for three places. Those elected
were J Tidy, M Town and M
Wiszowaty.
Barry Austin spoke to his
motion withdrawing support from
the National Abortion Campaign
and putting a motion to U L U
Student Representative Council
to d o l i k e w i s e . M r A u s t i n
explained with a visual aid that
abortion late in pregnancy was
'abhorrent'.
An amendment proposed by
Bryan Smith deleting previous
U n i o n p o l i c y w a s narrowly
passed. A second 'delete all and
insert...' amendment proposed by
Kirsten Pratt urged that ICU write
to N A C voicing our disapproval at
late a b o r t i o n s but d i d not
a d v o c a t e U L U w i t h d r a w i n g
support. This was defeated and
the main motion carried despite a
speech against from Merche
Clark.
ICU President Mary Atten-
borough said afterwards that
because the U G M was so poorly
attended and immediate action
was required by this motion she
would be recommending to
Council that they refer this back to
a future U G M .
Iranian Society proposed a
motion deleting all previous
policy on Iran, calling on ICU to
support the Iranian Revolution
and condemn discrimination
against Iranian students in
Britain.
An amendment proposed by
Tony C o x was passed which
ridiculed the original motion, but
before a vote could be taken
Kirsten Pratt challenged the
quorum and the show ended.
