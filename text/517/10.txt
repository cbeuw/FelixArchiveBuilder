The 'National Blood Transfusion Service' will be visiting IC on
Tuesday and Wednesday 29th and 30th May. They need 320
contributions of blood (from 320 people) to make it worth their while so
I hope you will give them your full support. In exchange you will receive
a drink of some sort and some biscuits. Also you will have the
satisfaction of knowing that your blood is going to help someone who
needs it more.
To avoid 'bunching' and the consequent inefficiencies, there is, or
should be, a notice in the JCR where you can select your own particular
time slot (with apologies to Kinkie and the Celts) and assist with the
smooth running of the collection. Optimum is 8 people per quarter hour.
The actual donating takes place in the Union Concert Hall in the
Union building. If you are unable to commit yourself to a specific time
you can always turn up on the day and see if you can be squeezed in.
Thanks, John Whitehouse.

P.S. I have some background leaflets on blood groups and Rhesus
babies if anyone would like to see them.

Nearly they stood who fell;
Themselves as they look back
See always in the track
T h e one false step, where all
Even yet, by lightest swerve
O f foot not yet enslaved,
By smallest tremor of the smallest nerve,
M i g h t have been saved.
Nearly they fell who stand,
A n d with cold after fear
Look back to mark how near
They grazed the Sirens' land,
Wondering that subtle fate,
By threads so spidery fine,
The choice of ways so small, the event so great,
Should thus entwine.
Therefore oh, man, have fear
Lest oldest fears be true,
Lest thou too far pursue
The road that seems so clear,
A n d step, secure, a hair's
Breadth past the hair-breadth bourne,
W h i c h , being once crossed forever unawares,
Denies return.
