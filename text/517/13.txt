NEWS IN BRIEF
IC Radio In London Marathon Programme
E l e v e n members of IC Radio
helped Radio London set a new
world record for the longest
continuous radio programme
last weekend, and found the
experience immensely enjoy-
able.
The programme was broad-
cast on Radio London and
Radio Medway from 6.00am on
Sunday until 6.30am on T u e s -
day. It was also transmitted
by IC Radio from 1.00 to 8.00
am on both nights, and IC Radio
staff were proud to hear their
station identifier included in
the broadcast every 15 minutes
throughout the night.
The IC Radio volunteers
provided mainly "hands off"
production back-up in several
shifts throughout the programme.
IC Radio Station Manager John
A l l e n put in a total of 30 hours
including both nights, providing
assistance to Radio L o n d o n ' s
producer D a v i d Carter. Other
students answered telephones,
manned reception and showed
parties of visitors around the
station.
The programme has as its
aim the raising of money i n an
appeal for the Year of the
C h i l d . O v e r £10,000was pledged
during the programme. The
money w i l l go into a fund ad-
ministered by , the Marylebone
Rotary C l u b to be distributed
among children's charities.
Throughout the broadcast
listeners phoned in and pledged
money in exchange for dedica -
tions, reguests and gifts. A
number of items were auctioned
including a signed cricket bat
which raised £150.
Several show business guests
took part including D i c k i e
Henderson, Tony Blackburn,
Simon Bates, and Lorraine
Chase, who helped by donating
money or gifts. Actor Richard
Briers of the " G o o d L i f e "
donated his trousers.
Much of the programme was
chat, records were played, and
musicians performed live on the
air.
Many of those involved work-
ed hard for hours at a time. John
A l l e n s a i d afterwards that he
was very happy with the way it
had gone. I C Radio staff had
gained useful experience.
Fees Rise Protest
The External Affairs Com-
mittee is c a l l i n g for a lobby of
the College Governors following
the recently announced rise in
tuition fees.
They want the College to
stop charging overseas students
more than home students and to
set up a hardship fund for
students who cannot meet the
new fees.
The Governors' Finance and
Executive Committees are meet-
ing on 25th May and tuition fees
is on their agenda. The lobby
w i l l b e outside 170 Queens Gate
from 10.30am. The E x t e r n a l
Affairs Committee w i l l also pre-
sent the Governors with a
petition signed by students
backing their demands.
T h i s action follows a month
long campaign against fee i n -
creases last term.
Colour Lunchbreak
S T O I C (Student T e l e v i s i o n
of Imperial College) broadcast
their first major television pro-
gramme in colour yesterday.
The production was their regular
lunchbreak programme.
This has been made possible
following the purchase by the
College T V Studio of a colour
camera and editing equipment
which is available to S T O I C .
Colour can now be received in
Southside but not in the J C R .
Future Housing Considered
A new College committee
for the development of student
accommodation is to be formed.
Its brief w i l l include consider-
ation of the setting up of head
tenancy arrangements and hous-
ing associations.
The proposal came from the
C o l l e g e ' s Student Residence
Committee. The Union has
recently been pressing for head
tenancy schemes.
New Houses
Conversion work on the new
student housing at 9 P r i n c e s
Gardens is on target and five
flats w i l l be ready in October,
Union President Mary Atten-
borough told Tuesday's Union
meeting.
Most of the flats can accom-
modate four students and a p p l i -
cations will be dealt with by the
College Residence office.
The recently acquired student
house at 53 E v e l y n Gardens w i l l
als o be ready in October and
w i l l house about 20 students.
Furniture Go Ahead
College has agreed to furnish
the new L i n s t e a d H a l l exten-
sion to the same standard as
existing L i n s t e a d H a l l rooms.
The allocation of £35,000
from the University Grants
Committee was found to be in-
adequate to furnish the new h a l l
of residence even using the
cheapest furniture. The Rector
has now said that College w i l l
find extra money.
