As proposer of Gruffydd Wyn
Jenkins for IGU A A O , I should
like to comment on the short
article on him which appeared in
last week's News In Brief.
Firstly, there was a little
confusion about the reason for his
resignation:
It was believed that his academic
standard was not good enough.
However, the real reason was that
he was thinking of standing again
next year, when he would have
more experience and do an even
better job, if elected. In his
unselfishness he decided to resign
for the time being.
Secondly, he was voted in fairly
and secretly at a quorate U G M ,
and I fail to see how it can be
assumed that the Miners, in
particular, voted for him.
I hope that the Union is
grateful for the invaluable work
which he has done so far.
A l l the best,
Iain Shacklock
Dear John, - Having been
involved in Meet IC on
• Wednesday 2nd May on the IC
Rag stall and having seen the
interest shown by the hundred or
so residents who attended the
function. I feel that it would be
much more desirable if this event
could be extended, possibly over
several days. This would enable
the college not only to encourage
more local residents to attend, but
also to invite representatives from
different companies with a view to
interesting them in employing
students from IC. It should also be
possible to allow the students to
iook around the exhibition, which
obviously took a lot of time and
effort to prepare, to let them get a
better idea of what is happening
in other departments.
This, I think, would be
valuable both for the college and
for the visitors.
Yours sincerely,
(love and Kisses)

Dear Sir, - I object to being
treated as an imbecile each time a
General Election comes round. I
knew that my vote would have no
effect on the result in my
constituency as a Conservative
M P was bound to be returned
with an increased majority. How
much longer will the intelligent
voter have to put up with a
situation where there are over 400
safe seats in which his/her vote is
bound to be wasted?
Of course, now that a Tory
government has been returned
with a substantial majority, there
will be no further mention of
electoral reform for five years
since they do not need to reiy on
Liberal votes to maintain a
majority. The cruel irony is that if
we had had proportional
representation at this election, the
Liberals would have had about 90
seats and would, in fact, hold the
balance of power.
We need to restore to people
the sense that their vote counts, no
matter who is cast for. The 'first-
past-the-post' system merely leads
to negative voting whereby
people do not vote according to
their true convictions.
Yours, etc

Dear John, -1 would like to thank
Mr Mooney and his staff for their
efforts at the R C S Annual dinner.
They gave me a lovely meal, even
though I am a 'difficult'
vegetarian. I know Sara
McGuinness would also like to
express her appreciation.

Dear Sir, - I wish to express my
gratitude to the Tizard Hall
warden for vetoeing my re-
application to hall after being
passed by the reselection
committee, (very democratic!).
T h e reason given: my
unsuitable attitude b e i n g
detrimental to hall life. This
complete judgement of my
character being backed up by the
numerous trouble incidents
(none!) and our very lengtthy
acquaintance (at least two
minutes).
My gratitude also for his excellent
timing, it now being impossible to
apply for Hamlet Gardens
accommdation and therefore a
big question mark over my future
'home".
Obviously as warden he
considers there to be excellent
reasons for this action. But as I am
sure many would agree, reaching
a decision of this importance from
a small conversation, an amount
of non-complimentary heresay
and the total rejection of a
committtee (who are obviously
better acquainted with myself
than the warden is ever likely to
be!) does not correspond with the
helpful, understanding and fair
person I associate with the post of
warden.!
Yours, a dissatisfied
