? MEET FIONA GILSON:
IF's PUBLICITY OFFICER.
Well, before m y esteemed
President and your esteemed
Editor start going on at m e , I
had better put p e n to paper
and do as promised, write an
article about myself (what an
awful thought!)
H o w e v e r , I a m not t o o k e e n
on b o r i n g p e o p l e s o l will be as
brief a s I c a n . I, like a l l this
year's IF E x e c , a m o n t h e 2
year c o u r s e for b u d d i n g ,
y o u n g , b i - l i n g u a l secretaries.
Although I come from Guernsey
don't r e c k o n o n getting t o o
m a n y free p i n t s out of m e ! ! I
c a n a n d have b e e n seen at not
t oo infrequent intervals i n
either S t a n ' s b a r or t h e U n i o n
bar, so I t h i n k my face is
already fairly well k n o w n .
H o w e v e r , I have just h a d my
hair cut so d o n ' t b e s u r p r i s e d
if at first y o u don't r e c o g n i s e
me.
N o w , a b o u t my j o b i n t h e
U n i o n . I a m t h e P u b l i c i t y
Officer, a title w h i c h c o v e r s a
m u l t i t u d e o f sin s i n c l u d i n g the
p u b l i c a t i o n o f a b r o a d s h e e t
now a n d t h e n (all articles
a b o u t c l u b s e t c v e r y
w e l c o m e ) . But, apart from
that, I have to p u b l i c i z e a n y
f o r t h c o m i n g events w h i c h are
m o r e o f t e n t h a n n o t
c o n n e c t e d with I C . B e c a u s e
our c o l l e g e is so small w e
really d o a p p r e c i a t e b e i n g
able to be i n v o l v e d with all
y o u r activities, so please don't
hesitate t o c o n t a c t m e or a n y
other member of t h e U n i o n i f
y o u think that t h e p r e s e n c e o f
y o u n g l a d i e s w o u l d b e
w e l c o m e d at any event.
W e w o u l d also like t o see
m o r e I C p e o p l e c o m i n g down
to I F to visit u s a n d o u r
o v e r w o r k e d coffee m a c h i n e s .
T h e U n i o n r o o m can be f o u n d
at 13A C r o m w e l l M e w s a n d
y o u a r e a l l m o r e t h a n
w e l c o m e . H o w e v e r , d u e to t h e
p o w e r s that be, this w e l c o m e
c a n only be e x t e n d e d from
12.50 to 1.30pm - short but very
sw e et!
W e l l , as I a m not a very
prolific writer, that's about all I
have to say, but if, at a n y time,
y o u see m e a r o u n d c o l l e g e
(IC) d o c o m e a n d have a chat -
I'd be only t o o p l e a s e d .

Hungry? In need of shelter?
Unable to keep your body warm?
W e l l here's news of a group you
can't afford not to be in — T H E
W O R K I N G C L A S S .
Y e s , for just eight hours a day,
forty eight weeks a year for all
your active adult life, you can
become a member of the world's
fastest growing class. A n d what's
more, W E P A Y Y O U F O R
Y O U R L A B O U R P O W E R !
This is how it works. Y o u come
to one of our thousands of
employers — the technical term is
capitalists, but don't worry about
that — and he gives you a J O B .
F r o m then on you make goods for
us — commodities — and we sell
them to people with money to
buy them. In return you get
W A G E S — or, if you work hard
and buy a suit we give you
S A L A R I E S ! Y o u can spend your
wages or salaries on anything you
need with O N E S I M P L E
C O N D I T I O N — you have to buy
cheap to stay alive.
W H A T ' S I N IT F O R U S ?
Nothing at all. W e employ you
because we want to use our
superior brain power to help the
less fortunate majority keep
alive. A s an added bonus we take
the P R O F I T S from your surplus
labour in order to maintain our
standard of living.
A s a W O R K E R you get plenty
of facilities. Cheap H O L I D A Y S
on crowded beaches in specially
allocated resorts, jolly
entertainments on the
T E L E V I S I O N and R A D I O to
keep you happy for the day
ahead, and free P U B L I C
H O U S E S where you can drown
your sorrows while boosting our
profits.
Life in the working class is
F U N , H A R D W O R K and
V E R Y R E W A R D I N G . W e need
Y O U to help us to help y o u !
A n d one final thing. W E ' R E
D E M O C R A T I C ! That's right!
Every five years we give you the
right to elect our representatives
into power again!
Not that m u c h to say this week
(Just as well - I have not got
that m u c h time) except that if
you are a regular attendfer of
U G M s you will know that we
are renewing all union policy
that is more than three years
old. At Tuesdays U G M I
brought to the attention of the
U G M the internal section of
the Union Policy Document
(pages 6-16). If no amend-
ments are received within a
week of the next U G M then it
is automatically ratified for
another three years unless a
specific motion is put forward
deleting or amending it.
Consider yourself notified!
