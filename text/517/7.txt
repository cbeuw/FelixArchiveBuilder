Welfare
It is often said that if you want to find somewhere decent to live, you
have got to start lookingforM a long time in advance of when you want it.
Unfortunately, this does not always work unless you are prepared to
start paying rent at the full rate from the moment that you find what you
are looking for.
There are still some landladies who are prepared to make bookings for
next year during the Summer term, they tend to be more of the lodgings
variety rather than any of the more independent kinds of
accommodation. The University of London Accommodation Office is
by far the best place to go to for this kind of bookable accommodation
and, if you want to use them, their procedure is set out below.
Apart from places where you live in the landladies house, there are not
many places that you can book in advance because most landlords are
more interested in keeping their places full rather than in having
students as tenants and this means that you have to compete for
accommodation with a great many people who are here all the year
round and who are quite happy to take a place on during the Summer for
- the rest of the Year.
The Summer period and the first term are not the best time for finding
accommodation, because from June until September a lot of landlords
let to overseas visitors at grossly inflated rates and then from September
onwards you are competing with thousnds of other students looking for
exactly the same kind of accommodation. This means that if you can't
find anything that you can book in advance, you have to be prepared for
the mad scramble at the beginning of term.
The best thing that you can do this term is to contact the University of
London Accommodation Office and the Welfare Centre towards the end
of this month and otherwise keep your ears open for news of anyone
giving up accommodation this term which might be available in the
Autumn.
ULU Accommodation Office
Procedure for Current Students
Single Students Rooms
Those seeking single or double roooms for September/October
should call at the Accommodation Office in late May/early June
allowing themselves a few free days to look at the accommodation.
(Flats for one person, ie room and kitchen or more, are included here,
but they are very difficult to find and expensive.) A retaining fee does not
have to be paid for this type of accommodation when it is booked in
advance. After the end of term priority is given to students who will be
new to London. Current students who have not found accommodation
by then, however, can consult the notice board in the Accommodation
Office.

How About A Place To Live
Next Year For Â£3 per week?
If enough people are interested, there is a possibility
that we may be able to form an IC Housing C o - o p and
take on some short life properties which could be done-
up and which would then provide very cheap
accommodation for two years or so.
'Short-life' properties are those which have been
earmarked for demolition (so that the area can be
redeveloped rather than because they are about to fall
down!). Cuts in public expenditure have meant delays in
redevelopment and so the houses have been left empty in
the hope that one day there will be enough money to
carry out the redevelopment.
Some of these houses have been left empty for some
time and they need quite a lot of work doing to them to
make them habitable. The idea is that those interested in
living there next year could do the work during the
summer vacation and pay back the cost of materials and
outside help in the form of rent over the next two years. If
you are interested and feel that you could make a fairly
heavy committment to the scheme this summer, contact
the Welfare Centre on the third floor of the Union
Building.
Single Students Flats
Any accommodation larger than one room with cooking facilities is
considered a flat. Only very few owners of such property will take a
booking for the next session without charging full rent during the
vacation. Unless the group is able to pay rent from late June/early July it
is unlikely that a flat will be found before the end of term, but enquiries
can be made from late May onwards. Otherwise, the search should start
about four weeks before the rent can be paid and the earlier in
September this is the better. It is advisable to allow at least a few days to
find a flat; in September it is often possible to book temporary
accommodation in the Halls of Residence whilst seeking a flat for the
term.
Married students
Current students requiring accommodation for a couple or family are
advised to try and find it in July or August rather than leave it until
September. It is generally fruitless to start looking more than four weeks
before the rent can first be paid. Addresses cannot be sent out of
London and the mailing list service is generally suspended in late July.
