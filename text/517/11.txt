Spirits Having Flown - Bee Gees (RSO)
If the title of this record is any comment
upon the musical content then I tend to agree,
there does not seem to be much 'spirit' in the
music.
There is a great temptation to slang any
new piece of music from the Bee Gees, if
oniy because of the sickness affecting critics,
being that the approval of the music press
must be inversely proportional to the group's
popularity with the record buying public.
However in this case, I think that a lot of the
criticism levelled at the Gibb Brothers is
deserved. 'Spirits Having Flown' is unoriginal,
lacks variation and shows the brothers as
being totally uncreative. I believe that this
album is a waste of talent, which the Gibbs
surely have.
It seems that following the success of
'Saturday Night Fever' the Bee Gees 'rightly'
decided that there was more money to be
made from following that blue-print.
In general this album can be very well
summed up by a phrase used for describing
one of Elton John's albums, by a non-
understanding mother 'But it all sounds the
same'. Having heard the singles you don't
need to listen to the LP. But perhaps this is an
unfair generalisation, there is a definate
variation in tempo, some songs are fast,
others slow. Also there is one moderately
pleasing track, at the end of the entire album,
'Until', which is two minutes and twenty-five
seconds long, the vocals are harsher, not so
highly-pitched, disco-beat is absent (in fact it
is difficult to detect any beat at all) and pleas-
ant use is made of a string section. Much of
this songs mediocre success though must be
due to its brevity.
Having been a mite vitriolic above, let's get
onto the good points. The Bee G e e s know
how to sing, they hit every noteexactly, and if
you don't get very irritated by their insistence
on singing falsetto, the harmonies stick
together very well. The majority of the songs
have a highly formularized structure,
consisting of a short chord sequence
repeated continuously throughout the song,
with an adequate, if unimaginative, rhythm
laid down on the drums, not forgetting the
squeaky vocals; all excellent disco material,
and very catchy tunes. There is one
outstanding sax solo, from Gary Brown
R E C O R D S
(unfortunately only outstanding due to the
quality of the rest of the music, it would not
stand up against anything played by the
venerable Grover Washington J n r or any
other saxophone master), which occurs
during 'stop, think again'.
It is hardly surprising that no word sheet is
supplied with the album, unless it was printed
with very large letters not much of the sheet
would be filled, and as for the lyrical content,
every song on the record is a love song, and
mostly of the type Boy-loves-girl, girl-no-
longer-loves-boy . I am still trying to work out
what is meant by the lines:
I did not realise that it was possible to climb
love.
The main criticism of 'Spirits' is that it is
very similar to previous material that the Bee
Gees have produced, and that most tracks on
the album are extremely alike. I also happen
to find their squeaky singing decidedly
irksome.
This sort of music is eminently suitable for
piping into a cafe, as background music to
slurping coffee.

TENNIS
O n Saturday the 1st V I had
their first outing ol the year with
an away match against Wycombe
House. Being unable to secure
A C C Transport the team and an
A - Z trotted oiftoOsterly by tube.
O n arriving on the great West
R o a d we were told where to go by
a smart girl in a sports car and had
to ask someone else the way.
We set off to groans from the
secretary w h o d i d not want to
walk owing to a rough Friday
night. A s we w a l k e d , we
marvelled at the large planes in
the sky, and exclaimed 'isn't
nature wonderful'. Then, wait for
it, concorde (chorus of trumpets).
Traffic ground to a halt, a pram
ran into a tree and O'Boyle fell
over (he too was not feeling his
best).
After such excitement the
whole was ready for anything and
we soon found Wycombe House
(credit to Sean who had the
book). O w i n g to the rain we had
to look elsewhere for dry courts.
Happily Osterly is a mating
ground for tennis courts of all
bread and colour and we were
soon playing on the local council
tarmac courts.
The match progressed to a
happy ending (like all stories
should) with only one short break
for rain, I C winning by 11 1/2 sets
to 6 1/2. Everyone played well at
times, though almost everyone
was afflicted with nerves, lack of
practice and the effects of the
previous night, especially Sean
who shall remain nameless.
A n excellent tea followed with
the team contriving to finish
e v e r y last m o r c e l . S e a n
threatened to spoon up the j a m
but we got a lucky reprieve.
In conclusion, it was an
excellent start to the season with
everyone enjoying the summer
sport of b o m b a r d i n g their
opponents as hard as they could.

IC 1st XI v South Stanmore
JCRICKET IC 2nd XI v Chelsea College 1st
The 1st XI finally found
opposition of their own standard.
South Stan">ore fielded an
unhealthy looking bunch of
Pensioners who might have been
more at home in a cardiac ward.
Toplis w o n the toss and
g e n e r o u s l y i n v i t e d S o u t h
Stanmore to bat. Early on the
wheelchairs got rusty in the rain
and even Stantiford was quick
enough in the field to produce a
run-out. After this Ellacott was
able to rip through their batting
with his slow left-arm leg-breaks.
He finished with 6 wickets. Two of
these wickets fell to lucky slip
catches by Pitts whose nose is
s h a r p e r than his reactions.
Meanwhile Chadband had lulled
the opposition into a false sense
of security and picked up a wicket
thanks to a magnificent full-
length, one handed catch by
Mano Mylvalganan. There was
also another run-out and South
Stanmore declared at 60 for 9.
This declaration was anobvious
mistake as Stantiford was out to
prove that he is the luckiest
batsman in college. A series of
dropped catches and edged shots
meant that he managed to reach a
fluky 43 runs in a first wicket stand
of 61 with Mylvalganan. The latter
c o m p l a i n e d b i t t e r l y t h a t
S t a n t i f o r d h a d ' f a r m e d t h e
b o w l i n g ' . F a r m i n g w a s an
appropriate term for Stantifords
innings.
The outcome of this afternoon
of fun and gaiety was, therefore, a
win for IC by ten wickets.
S p e a k i n g as a n i m p a r t i a l
observer, I can only say the first
eleven had the luck of the gods
and obviously needed to promote
key members of the 2nd XI.
South Stanmore: 60 for 9 dec
IC: 61 forO
Result: Narrow victory

P.S. Any resemblance to real fact
in this report is purely
coincidental.
Skipper Furnish started the day
off as he meant to go on - badly.
He arrived late but we would have
been better off if he had not come
at all. After demonstrating his
talents as ace tosser, he
misguidedly elected to bat. The
two opening batsmen offered an
interesting contrast in style.
Morton looked the classical
straight bat whilst Kenrick would
have been more at home in a hay
b a r n . S o m e h o w K e n r i c k
cultivated 34 runs in an impressive
looking opening stand of 69,
(soixante-neuf to you Hewkin).
Furnish then came to the
crease. The quickest thing he did
all day was to leave again after an
edgy 5 runs. The day was saved by
John (I didn't miss out this time in
Oxford) Care. With his classy
forward defensive swipe over mid-
wicket managed 28 not out.
At this stage Furnish made a
huge blunder. He declared at 144
for 2 depriving IC of certain
victory, and, more importantly,
depriving the excellent Morton of
a certain century. Morton had to
settle for a meagre 73 not out.
The IC bowling was opened by
Dean and Wyatt. Their opening
attack had the penetration of a wet
rice-pudding. The joke was
carried to a farce by introducing
Care to the fray. The three
bowlers bowled a mixture of full
tosses and long-hops and it was
no surprise when Chelsea raced
to 146 for 3 to win. Care blamed
the fielding and saved some
special abuse for Morton w h o
missed a stumping. It should be
pointed out, however, that Morton
was so surprised by Care's
straight ball (his rare speciality)
that the thought of a stumping
was far from his mind.
A p a r t from t h e a p p a l i n g
captaincy, the only other noteabie
feature of the game was the sub-
arctic conditions. The teams were
continually on and off the pitch
and this obviously spoilt the IC
teams concentration which may
account for the defeat.
IC : 144 for 2 declared (very
sporting)
Chelsea: 146 for 3
Result: Lucky win for Chelsea.
