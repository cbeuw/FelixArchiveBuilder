KEYMER DOE8 IT AGAIN! - B U T ONLY JUST!
Last Saturday (5th May) saw the U L U Snooker Championship,
second only to the embassy world championship, with £10 as first prize,
and £2,000,000 for a maximum 147. 21 contestants entered (2 LSE,
2RHC, 1 Guy's, 1 Charing Cross Hospital, 15 IC). The contest started at
11am, and yours truly was lucky enough to draw Geoffrey Donald
Stokes Keymer, the defending champion, in the first match of the day
(needless to say that I got hammered). Mr Keymer, in fact, had it easy for
most of the day until he got to the semi-final and met a very on-form
Dave Crossland. He scraped through 2-0, and at 11pm, the first frame of
the final started. Mr Keymer's opponent was Keith Underwood, from
Guy's Hospital, who had played steadily and well all day. Keymer,
feeling the title so close, played casually for the first two frames, and lost
both of them, Keith Underwood taking all the chances that were
presented to him. In the third frame, however, Geoff asserted himself,
and won 90-8. The fourth frame was nail-biting, eventually going to a
black ball shoot-out. Keymer succeeded in potting the black after
Underwood narrowly missed a long pot. And so everything depended
on the fifth and final frame, and once again Keymer asserted himself,
and won convincingly. So at 1.15am, Sunday morning, I handed Geoff
the first prize of £10, and he became the first student to successfully,
defend his title.
I would like to thank the following staunch members of IC Snooker
Club, who refereed matches and helped me get everything ready for the
contest: Mark Cherry, Martin Proudlove, Alex Cameron, Gareth Machin,
Steve Jeans, Geoff Keymer and John Healy.
Club Matters: There will be a joint
committee meeting on Wed 16th
May in the Union TV Lounge at
1pm. Any member of the club is
welcome, but may only speak at
the Chair's discretion (this is not a
general meeting). Among the
items on the agenda are the
discussion of the estimates of
expenditure for next year, and the
handing over of power to the new
committee.
Other Matters: As of last week, a
new system of booking the table
has been in action.
It gives all members a better
chance to book the hours they
want so after the exams, why not
come and have a nice relaxing
game of snooker? Next year, I
hope to field 3 teams to play
against other London Colleges. If
you would like to play in any one
of them, why don't you come up
and see me some time? Unlike
previous years, everyone will be
given a chance to play in a team if
they are good enough, not only a
selected few. I will elaborate on
this matter later.
