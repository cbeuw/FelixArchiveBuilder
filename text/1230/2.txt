Wine Stolen From Union
Thirty-two bottles of wine,
worth over £200, were stolen
from the Union Dining Hall last
week in the latest of a series of
thefts and attempted thefts in
the Union building.
The consignment w a s
placed there at lunchtime i n
advance of a wine tasting ses-
sion by A B V - the RCSU club
formed b y the merger of the
former wine-tasting, cocktail
and real ale societies - but
was taken at some point dur-
ing the afternoon. A B V mem-
bers are able to use the ses-
sions to learn h o w to 'taste,
sniff and slurp' wines under
the guidance of an expert.
The Union has conceded
joint responsibility for the
wine having being left i n the
unsecured room but h a s
agreed to fully reimburse A B V
for the loss. Security are cur-
rently checking C C T V footage
in the hope of identifying
those responsible.
The theft comes in the wake
of a series of similar incidents
on the first floor of the Union
building. A student had their
bag stolen recently from
reception, and the handbag of
M a n d y Hurford, Union
Manager, was taken from her
office in a 'walk-in' theft.
In addition, the office of
Dave Parry, Union Finance
Manager, w a s involved i n a
similar incident a month ago.
It is thought that thieves
entered and searched for valu-
ables, but nothing was taken.
In view of the location of the
office, it is thought that the
perpetrators were likely to be
either students or staff, and
may have been scared off
before they were able to take
anything.
Ken Weir, head of College
Security, told Felix that stu-
dents and staff alike should
remain vigilant with respect to
securing their personal prop-
erty. He added that bags and
coats should never be left
unattended over the back of
chairs, for instance when i n
the libraries. Room doors
should always be locked when
rooms are to be left unattend-
ed, even if it is only for two
minutes. Valuables should
never be left where they can
be seen from outside, espe-
cially i n rooms i n the base-
ment or on the ground floor.
Similarly, windows should not
be left open when rooms are
unattended.
A B V hopes to hold its intro-
ductory wine tasting session,
which h a d to be postponed
following the theft, in the near
future.

RAG Week Success
More than £9000 w a s raised
for the Shooting Star
Childrens' Hospice A p p e a l
during this year's R A G week.
The eight-day extravaganza
culminated i n last Friday's
'School Uniform Day', in which
students took the opportunity
to turn up in the apparel of
their alma mater in return for a
small charitable donation.
Money was also collected on
the day b y a pair of R A G
kissagrams, and several hun-
dred balloons were released
from the Queen's Lawn in the
R A G Balloon Race. Collectors
also hassled money from busi-
nessmen a n d women i n
Canary Wharf before heading
back to Friday night's R A G
party at the Union.
The week of fundraising had
begun on Valentine's Day, just
over a week earlier. A barber-
The long road home: Parachutists head to ICU
shop quartet had toured the
campus to deliver serenades
and roses to unsuspecting
sweethearts. Many volunteers
armed w i t h collecting tins
were out in force at the gates
of College early on Friday
morning and the International
Pub C r a w l raised yet more
money for the appeal the fol-
lowing day.
R A G fundraisers took to the
streets of the capital with a set
of challenges to complete on
Wednesday i n the London
Raid. IC Radio acquired a life-
size cut out of a man and
woman locked i n somewhat
more than an embrace and
managed to obtain the sup-
port of Radio l ' s Mark and
Lard. Other fundraisers took
part in a game of tiddlywinks
along Oxford Street.
The C & G Slave Auction took
place on Thursday, a n d IC
Radio's 'Ben and Jerry' broad-
cast the event live from the
JCR. The Hit Squad were also
out and available for hire to
attack any student or staff
member with 'custard pies'.
Other events included a
night of Jazz at the Union and
abseiling down the Chelsea
Design Centre. In a fundrais-
ing event not connected with
RAG, a group of students also
took part i n a 'Sponsored
Naked Kamikaze Parachute
Jump", and ran from Harrods
to the Union building sans
clothing.

went on during the biggest
week of the ICU calendar, see
