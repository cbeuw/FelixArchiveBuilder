A Fine Cornish Pasting
Carnbourne 17 29 R S M
The sun rose around Hyde
park last Friday as "all three"
of the R S M rugby team "the
best looking team in IC" made
their w a y to the union office.
They, were greeted b y the
sight of Enrico i n the early
stages of a nervous break-
down. Spirits were high as the
RSM were on their w a y to
humiliate a bunch of Cornish
retards - Camborne School of
Mines - for the sixth year in a
row.
We settled on to the coach,
and were introduced to Dean,
our driver for the weekend,
and no sooner had w e reached
Queens Gate, J i m " T h e
Panther" Mccuscker produced
a p o m stash that would rival
the contents of any Soho sex
shop. Somewhere near Exeter,
Flo decided that everyone w a s
in need of a bit of light enter-
tainment, Light it wasn't,
Dean couldn't keep his eyes on
the road and the bus swerved
wildly across the motorway,
(think t w o marrows being
forced in a smarties tube). We
arrived in Newquay to drop off
the Homosexual footballers
and associated riff raffso they
could go drinking. The real
men arrived at the panty-cel-
lyn's sister hotel (ask geology
3) and settled in for the night.
A Chinese a n d a game of
arrows later, people went to
bed, but not before Rhys had
squeezed in a sly pint or two.
Those that h a d not suc-
cumbed to hypothermia dur-
ing the night rose for breakfast
and were served b y the
Cornish female wrestling
champion, and a training ses-
sion later and w e were ready
for action. T h e drive to
Camborne w a s accompanied
by Chin-Choi's musical collec-
tion to get in the mood, and a
brief stop at Tescos resulted in
the purchase of half a Banana
plantation and 50 gallons of
Lucozade. Following a word of
inspiration from Dean, along
the line that w e were to go
and F*cking murder the scum,
we set out for a trek through a
cow field and arrived at the
Camborne ground. Camborne
were training nearby, a spying
party was sent out, and Henry
set the tone for the day by
abusing the Camborne cap-
tain Sideshow Bob. The crowd
arrived and the game w a s
about to start live on Cornish
radio and taped for masses, as
unfortunately the T V has not
yet reached Camborne. Segun
punched a few doors in prepa-
ration for a Camborne players
head. T h e game started,
Segun got an early try which
resulted in the R S M propagan-
da minister Brewster bursting
into life and announcing to the
masses that Camborne had
cracked. They h a d cracked,
into their ringers...
A few tactical substitutions
later and Camborne were 45
stone heavier in the pack, but
they couldn't do anything to
halt the black magic, and The
Angel Gabriel ran i n a try or
two. A passing seagull picked
up the ball and dropped it over
the R S M posts giving the
inbreds 3 points.
At some point i n the first
half Segun broke his shoulder
but didn't notice until Sunday.
Who knows what the score
was or when the tries were
scored, but half-time arrived.
Some w a g from Camborne
tried to streak, but he hadn't
bargained for the Northern
streaking king i n the R S M
crowd. The Ginger prince Don
Juan de Christian burst from
the crowd and chased away
the Cornish pervert before
being floored by a back injury.
The display of pasty flesh put
the R S M boys out of synch for
a few minutes letting
Camborne catch up to 17-19.
The panther was injured so
the R S M secret weapon Super
Brewster made his debut,
quite w h y no one knows, but
he provided entertainment by
swiftly having his nose pul-
verised b y some thug. Bigg
Dave had an argument with a
concrete post a n came off
worse, any sympathy from the
ladies would be appreciated.
Some inbred surf boy stamped
on Henry and was sent off, Flo
desperate to hit the dance
floor scored, then deciding
that w a s not in the constitu-
tion Enrico rattled one i n .
What a surprise, w e w o n
again the final score 17-29 to
the RSM.
The drinking began i n
earnest, Henry w a s live on
the radio, a star in the making.
We went to a dinner, where
there was a lack of wine so w e
sent someone down the off
license thing descended into
anarchy, lots of people had
birthdays a n d Brewster
chucked the flower arrange-
ment at some Horn from
Camborne football a n d
announced Henrys engage-
ment, which was news to him.
Balson entertained the local
ladies, to put it mildly. We
drank some more there were
some fireworks and then it all
went a bit hazy. O n the w a y
back Mr Nigeria "found" some
cigars, the bus Withers tried
to dismantle the bus, Brewster
tried to grope anything that
moved. Much food was stolen
from the service station, and
that's a l l I c a n remember.
Victory bar-night ensued and
we think Nightingale got tied
up somewhere, but who cares.
