C ondom-inium?
Dear Felix,
I would like to write to both
Jolyon Thompson and Irene
Weinreib with regard to their
reply to an Inkwell article
printed the issue before, an
article I wholeheartly agreed
with.
Surely the single most
important aim should be to
promote being responsible
and safe to those who are
going to have sex, and to make
this as easy as possible. A n d
the worst argument has to be
that displaying condoms
would be offensive to those
whose religious group oppos-
es contraception. I'm sorry, but
if I was a member of one of
these religious groups then I
would find this argument itself
offensive. We undoubtedly live
in a multicultural society:
Surely it is time that we are all
able to accept each other the
way we are, and live peaceful-
ly together? She argues that
it's disappointing that we live
in a society that is too
repressed to talk about sex,
yet seems happy that we live
in a society too repressed to
openly accept each others
beliefs. I'm not arguing that
we should be brazen or insen-
sitive, but I would ask how
many people would admit to
be offended by a few packets
of condoms placed discreetly
in the corner of the health cen-
tre?
In reply to Irene, if the health
centre has to provide statistics
concerning their supply of con-
doms, how are they able to
give 2500 to the ICSU to dis-
tribute during freshers week?
Do the freshers have to fill out
a form? Since they are able to
do this, can they not for exam-
ple provide 20% without this
frankly ridiculous bureaucra-
cy? These could be placed in
the health centre at start of
each morning's surgery and
made available to those who
do not feel confident in having
to fill out a form and having
their "statistics" placed on
their patient record.
Sadly, it seems that because
the health centre has
favourable statistics regarding
unwanted pregnancies, it
therefore feels that there is no
motivation for trying to make
those statistics even better.
It's easy to accept things for
the way they are, but much
more difficult to strive for
improvement. Especially in the
face of people such as Jolyon
who seems delightfully happy
in blindly accepting the status
quo, without any considered
thought for the issues
involved.
Yours,
Anonymous.
Just for the record, we believe
Jolyon is a man, contrary to the
belief of our correspondent.

Elect-rocution
Page 12 of last week's Felix
explains the ICU voting rules:
'You will then be required to
vote by the Single Transferable
Vote System... If you put a 1
next to RON, all other numbers
will be ignored.'. Why is this?
It's reasonable you could put
RON as your first choice and
then go on to give a second
choice, if you want to say:
none of the above candidates
is really up to the job but if it
has to be one of them then
candidate X is the best of a
bad lot. This way of giving
second and subsequent choic-
es (in case your first choice
doesn't get in) is what STV is
all about.
With the current system, if
you put RON as your first
choice you effectively lose the
rest of your vote. But this does
not apply to other candidates.
Perhaps someone from the
Union could explain the reason
for this discrimination against
RON.
E d Avis
We have contacted the
Returning Officer for the sab-
batical elections, David
Francis, who replied that there
was indeed an error in the arti-
cle. RON's votes will be reallo-
cated just like any other candi-
date if RON is eliminated from
any ballot. Ed.
LEQ-rocution
Dear Felix,
Please could you find out from
Prof Rawlings:
1. How much did the L E Q sys-
tem cost IC?
2. Where did the money come
from (internal, government,
or private sector)?
3. Who built it (was it in-house
or contracted, and if con-
tracted, who to)?
4. Are departments forced to
use the college L E Q or are
they free to develop and use
their own system instead?
5. Would he welcome an alter-
native system developed by
IC Students?
The rumours I have heard
answer:
1. £40 000
2. Government
3. Contractors
4. They have to use L E Q
5. Unknown (likely no)
but I would appreciate having
the truth from the person who
should know best...
Regards,
Philip Willoughby

The Hall Guy
Dear Felix,
It has come to my attention
that Sir Richard Sykes is
intending to sell Garden Hall,
in Prince's Gardens (Felix, 25
January).
Garden, as is affectionately
called by all its residents, was
only refurbished in the last
couple of years, and has a
warm and friendly atmos-
phere, with the obvious
advantage of proximity to uni-
versity. Even if you choose to
disregard such important fac-
tors, you cannot help but won-
der whether Sir Richard really
has his students' interests at
heart, for surely it makes no
sense whatsoever to sell one
of the only remaining halls
which offers such cheap
accommodation (from £35 a
week in double and triple
rooms). In doing so, Imperial is
effectively being turned into
an ever more exclusive univer-
sity. Moreover, if anything,
Imperial needs more rooms not
less. Can it seriously afford to
lose any? For example, most of
the other great London univer-
sities offer accommodation for
third or final year students.
If this plan is allowed to go
ahead, then surely there will
be nothing to stop any further
decisions to close down other
halls. It is all good and well
that Imperial needs to raise
money, but at who's expense?
I urge Felix and its readers to
question the motives behind
Sir Richard's plans, and to
ponder on the implications of
reducing cheap rooms near the
University. Is this really the
best way forward?
