Ultimate National Championships
The first game for Discdoctors
was against the lowest seed,
Exeter, and Discdoctors took
the game comfortably, 6-1,
but were not in full swing by
the arrival of the second game
against the Lancaster, and
the game was lost 6-4. This
game appeared to wake
Doctors up, who then played
against the home team,
Loughborough. After the pre-
vious weekend's demolish-
ing, Doctors w a n t e d
vengeance. In a tight game,
w i t h some difficult calls,
Doctors managed to keep
Haze to a low score, and
eventually took the game 3-2.
Sheffield were the next oppo-
nents, and the Doctors turned
them over 8-4. The following
game was against tourna-
ment favourites, Glasgow.
They were commanding
throughout the game, and
although Doctors were full of
effort, and played some good
ultimate, the better team w o n
comfortably, Glasgow taking
the game 7-4
The next game was against a
strong Ow! side from Oxford,
and ended in a 7-7 drawleav-
ing Doctors w i t h a 3-2-1
record, and a following match
against Portsmouth. Doctors'
nemesis once again threw
their zone and killed off the
Doctors' offense. Doctors
heads dropped, and sublime
took the game easily, 6-2.
Due to a very close group, the
final result of the first round
put Doctors in third place in
the pool, now seeded 6th
overall. This was a dramatic
improvement on their initial
Dancesport
The IC Dance Team arrived in
Reading for the Southern
Universities Dance
Champion-ships, ready for
battle against the rest of the
Big Three (i.e. us, Oxford and
Cambridge). We arrived early
and everyone had a full £2
breakfast courtesy of 'the big
ASDA', which could perhaps
justify the good atmosphere
and hence our good results
that day...
For the first time this sea-
son, our Beginners managed
to outnumber Oxford in their
Latin section of the competi-
tion with 3 of 5 finalists in the
Jive and 2 of 5 in the Cha. Two
couples also managed to get
into the finals of the
Beginners Ballroom, so all in
all, well done to Phong and
Gait, Philip and Annelise,
Tom and Jo, Konrad and
Melissa, as well as Simon
and Sarah. A s for the Opens,
Ellis and Indika w o n the
Advanced Latin and the
award for 'the couple show-
ing the most promise as voted
for by the judges' (or some-
thing along those lines).
Special congratulations to
Ashoke and Bryony for win-
ning the Novice Ballroom .
The Team event went well,
with every mixed final having
at least one IC couple (2 in the
Jive, Waltz and Quickstep).
We didn't w i n a team trophy
this time round but it was still
a good day (which was meas-
ured by the amount of
singing, or screeching,
depending on who you talk to,
generated on the coach the
way back). There's IVDA in
two weeks, guys and gals,
and we K N O W we're good
enough to beat 'Watford'.
CP
seeding of 13th, and also
guaranteed a top eight finish.
The party went along with
the Doctors team, as usual at
the centre of attention. Well,
perhaps not. At least we all
had a nice sleep and were rar-
ing to go the next day.
The quarterfinal was against
the oldest club in the country,
the Warwick Bears.
Discdoctors were very fired
up for this game, as were the
opposition. Discdoctors were
on defence first, and man-
aged to force a turnover and
get the crucial break point.
Another point followed, and
Discdoctors were looking
good. Bears managed to get
back to 2-2, and from there
the teams traded points. It
was 6-6 at the end of time,
and so the game went into
sudden death. After numer-
ous nervous errors from both
teams resulting in a number
of turnovers, and a difficult
situation w i t h some music,
Bears eventually took the
win.
After this disappointment,
Discdoctors played against
Leeds. The spirit of the team
was very low, and a poor per-
formance meant Leeds took
the game comfortably.
The 7th-8th place match was
then against Cardiff. The
game was played in a very
light-hearted manner, as both
teams were disappointed not
to be in the top four. So, final-
ly, Discdoctors ended up 8th
in the country. Well done to
Glasgow, the worthy winners
of the competition.
