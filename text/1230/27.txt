I'm back at the helm of the crossword this week to keep you buggers on
your toes. We've tried to make the quotes a little harder this time as
some cheeky young scamp complained about last week's efforts. It looks
like me and Bobby C might be getting a bit more space next year to
entertain you with our witful wizardry, so if anyone's got any ideas for
cool, new coffee break features or fancies themselves as a budding
crossword compiler let us know, cos' we'll be on the look-out for fresh
talent. Last week's winner is Kris Dickerson, Biochem III. He/she (sorry
I don't know) will join the ranks of millions in the draw for the PS2. Keep
up the good work my pretties. Dr. Hot Fudge
