Royal Holloway III 2 6 IC II
Shock! After piling the pres-
sure on, Holloway hit us on
the attack and their player
skinned Magic,spent from the
night before, before doing
Mills in a similar manner. A s
Judas began to sing at him,
the striker responded by nut-
megging the keeper. IC were
now fighting. Magic atoned
for previous errors by drilling
a twenty five yard free kick
into the bottom corner. When
Brad poked in a rebound from
close range. Chances came by
the bucket load and the match
could have been killed before
half-time. .
Barry summoned us to draw
on our strengths and stay on
our feet against players who
were clearly unable to defend
against the electric pace of
the seconds attack. We flew
at them, punishing their
efforts to push forward. One
way traffic ensued as Baskett
completed a fantastic hat-
trick, Lansdowne scored a
deserved interchange goal
and Cartwright hit the goal of
the game, a bolt from twenty
five yards into the top corner.
Their only response was to
pile men forward and when
Dave H "lost his man" at the
far post Holloway had man-
aged to score the token two
goals the seconds concede as
a matter of habit in the cup.
The final whistle went and the
celebrations started. The arch
rivals of Holloway had been
thrashed an embarrassing 6-2
to send the mighty seconds to
the final, on March 9 .
Come along and support in
the provided coaches, and see
us bring the cup back to South
Kensington. Boost.
Wushu
"Awesome!" - In one word,
this is how the IC Wushu
Team would unanimously
describe Sifu Chen Lei's mas-
terclass that took place on
Saturday 9th February in
Southside Gym.
Sifu Chen Lei's breathtaking
performances of Taijiquan,
Changquan 'long boxing' and
the Drunken Style (which are
part of the highest level of this
discipline) clearly testified to
his absolute mastery of the
different wushu forms - both
in space and time. They were
not merely demonstrations of
human physical fitness at its
highest level, but of mental
and spiritual awareness as
well.
Watching Sifu Chen Lei, a
quadruple National Wushu
Champion of China, one
would be very tempted to say
that truly, there is no better
mirror than wushu to reflect
the beauty of Chinese thought
and the Yin and Yang philoso-
phy. Indeed, wushu is about
harmony between contrasts.
It is grace and strength com-
bined; it is both relaxed fluid
moves and powerful energy
explosions. It can be slow and
languid on the one hand but
swift and precise on the other.
Wushu is about discovering
the secret of a calm mind
guiding a quick body for max-
imum efficiency.
5 hours of intense training
with one of the most inspiring
martial artists of our times
turned out to be, indeed, a
most fulfiling experience for
all those present - for IC
wushu lovers, definitely an
earth-shattering sensation.

The first period was the
calmest and least eventful:
good for the new players still
finding their feet, and allow-
ing our more experienced
players to give us a 2-1 lead
after a couple of goals from
Mikko.
Things started warming up
in the second period, with our
self-titled 'C. Penguin' being
given a five minute penalty,
along with his victim, for prac-
tically slicing one of the
Cambridge boys in half. By
now Cambridge were used to
our ice, with their dwarfish
centre making several danger-
ous breaks toward goal.
However, thanks in no small
part to keeper and man-of-
the-match Adrian Gill, and
some nifty defence work, we
kept a clean sheet during this
period. Our attack thoroughly
outclassed the Cambridge
defence this period, w i t h
impressive shifts from all
three lines. At the close of the
second we led 7-1 thanks to
goals this time from Mikko (3),
Dmitry and Alex.
Despite a couple of consola-
tion goals which excited their
centre enough to stick his
tongue out at our bench (keep
it for your bird you hairy twat),
there was now no way back
for them. We pulled ahead fur-
ther with Mikko, Dmitry and
another of our attacking elite
putting three more past them
to end the game 10-3. A solid
performance from experi-
enced and new members
alike, the game will provide us
with a good base for the series
of matches and possible tour-
naments we have lined up in
the near future.
