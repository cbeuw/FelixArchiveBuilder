Last Chance to Vote Today
The election race to decide next year's
sabbatical team has been heating up all
week and culminates today in Imperial
students' last chance to cast their vote.
The most prominent election events took
place on Tuesday and Wednesday, when
the candidates were quizzed by students
at hustings i n both Wye a n d South
Kensington.
At the Wye campus there w a s a good
turn-out, and the candidates for President
and Felix Editor were particularly careful-
ly grilled. Wye's integration (or not) moti-
vated most of the questions along with
funding issues and, perhaps unpre-
dictably, fox hunting.
The second ordeal for candidates came
on Wednesday in the Union building, but
was overshadowed by controversy about
these elections' returning officer, David
Francis.
The first candidates to take the stage
were those for Deputy President (Finance
& Services). A l l the candidates performed
similarly, usually agreeing both on their
manifestoes and answers to questions.
David Francis: Returning Officer
At this point, Tasha Newton, former
Union President and maybe not as much
of a College celebrity as Andy Heeps,
unexpectedly took the stage to request
that questions be taken from the audi-
ence. The original intent had been to sub-
mit candidate questions through David
Francis, some of which he declined to
pose, but she w a s backed up by an emer-
gency convention of the Union Executive,
which took place near the bar. Regardless
of whether or not this meeting w a s valid,
the Election Committee decided to over-
rule M r Francis' questioning strategy,
thus allowing questions from the floor.
After all this fun, the candidates for
President were put through their paces.
The traditional pints were downed
(though M r Francis declined strong audi-
ence requests to do so too) and issues
from the NUS to the L E Q system and
funding were raised.
Questioning for the Clubs & Societies
Deputy President and that of Education &
Welfare proved reasonably uneventful
and were followed by the hustings for
Felix Editor, which were as colourful as
expected.
The results from the elections will be
announced in Felix early next week.
