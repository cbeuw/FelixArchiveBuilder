Ermmmm
Similar to the weekend,
but on a Monday
instead. One of my
favourite days, because
I go mad. Come and help
at Felix if you want.
Felix, All Night
Trivia
I'm good at this. I know
all about completely
useless things. M y
maths teacher told me it
was pointless, but now I
w i n cash at pub quizzes.
Da Vinci's, 7pm
Wotsits Wot Are Cheesy
They take a form of corn
based substitute, and
mix it with yummy
cheese flavourings. A n d
then get very drunk
with sportsmen. Yum.
Union, All Night
Karaoke
Go on, you know you
want to. Not to mention
the fact that there are
many drunk American
girls there who will also
be 'singing'. Hehe.
Union, 8pm
Kandy
M M M m m . Sweet sweet
Kandy. Hip Hop, Rock
the Shop, Get a Mop and
Grind to a Stop. Then
D A N C E ! That kind of
music, and more.

Shipping News
Dogger, Fisher, German
Bite, North Westerly
Gale Force 3 Proceeding.
Sorry, that's the fore-
cast. Kevin 'Don' Spacey
rebuilds his life, possibly
with Judi Dench.
From Hell
I'm still excited about
this, since it's got
Johnny Depp in it, and
I'm afraid he is funda-
mentally cool. So go and
see it. Even if he does
have a silly accent.
Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar
Kiya
Not sure, but it's doing
pretty well in the charts.
It seems like Bollywood
to me, and I think it's a
love triangle story. If you
like dancing...
Ali
Strangely not about the
Felix deputy editor, this
is instead about some
boxer who was quite
famous once. Who
knows, maybe he was a
war hero?
Training Day
I could do with one of
these, since I seem to be
losing my touch. Maybe
it's because I drink too
much. Maybe it's just
'cos I'm naturally stupid.
Oh yes, go see it.

Nu-soul bintings from
some binty bint who
may or may not be
attractive. No-one will
tell me, becuase I'm so
one-dimensional.
Shepherd's Bush Empire
Walkmen
They wander around,
and they're men. Maybe
playing musical instru-
ments, rather like travel-
ling minstrels. Perhaps
they play lutes. Or not.
The Monarch
The 45s
Presumably a band
relating to vinyl record
speeds. They were quite
good when they were
the 33s, but now they've
sold out. Boo.

Brixton Academy
Royksopp
No idea at all. Never
even heard of them. Nor
has anyone. Not a single
person. So they're prob-
ably really alternative
and cool.
