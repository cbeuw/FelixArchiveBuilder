H U N D R E D R E A S O N S - If I Could
I wonder if Hundred Reasons (pic above) will ever be popular?
Too odd for the monkeys who go ape for Blink 182, and too pop
for the hardcore masses, these over-earnest lads fall heavily
between two stools. This time around, they've neglected to
include either a decent, memorable tune or some good rock
action. They've been good in the past, but this is disappointing.

G O M E Z - Shot Shot
At last, some new material from Gomez. This is not a bad
song, with a catchy chorus and many different instruments, but
it's not in the same league as Get Myself Arrested or Bring It On.
Nonetheless, it makes a welcome change from the sombre
remix album Abandoned Shopping Trolley Hotline.

THE EIGHTIES M A T C H B O X B-LINE DISASTER -
Morning Has Broken
This band have got a lot to answer for - their name is a veri-
table mouthful, and their new single Morning Has Broken is
enough to cause any small child listening to burst into tears.
Sounding a bit like a satanic cross between the Strokes and the
Sex Pistols, this single is sure to annoy parents across the coun-
try. Having said all that, and although the A and B-sides are vir-
tually indistinguishable, this is well worth a listen or five.

THE D A N D Y W A R H O L S - Get Off
A catchy tune that picks up pace as it goes on, with a simple
rhythm and strange chanting voices in the background. At first,
I didn't think much of this, but it's definitely one of those tracks
that just sounds better on radio.

LAST M A N STANDING - Nobody
Glam-rock meets punk in this dark effort from Last Man
Standing, whose mixture of heavy guitar riffs and gravelly yet
tuneful vocals sounds like King Adora's Maxi Browne singing
for The Clash. The B-sides are more of the same, proving that
this band are definitely one to keep an eye out for in the near
future.

C O R N E R S H O P - Lessons Learnt From Rocky I To Rocky III
Tjinder Singh is back! A n d this time round he doesn't need
the remixing talents of Fatboy Slim to make him sound good.
Lessons Learnt From Rocky I To Rocky III sounds a bit like early
Super Furries without the Welshness, and the song title itself
has to be the greatest for... well, ages. Expect this to be on the
Radio 1 (over)playlist for at least the next ten months. Good B-
side, too.

THE S U P E R N A T U R A L S - What We D i d Last Summer
Oh dear! Whatever happened to The Supernaturals? They
used to be known for happy guitar-based rock, bringing us such
fabulous songs as Smile and Lazy Lover, but now all we get are
drum machines and too many synthesizers. What We Did Last
Summer is such a mess that nothing can repair it. The vocals
grate, the beats don't work and there are too many Human
League noises. Westlife aside, I never thought my ears could be
hurt this much.

ALPINESTARS - Snow Patrol
Snow Patrol is a lively dance track with a thumping bass line
and electronically mastered vocals, singing lyrics which seem
to be based on some kind of alpine sport. The B-sides are a bit
of a let down, however - a Lo-Fidelity Allstars remix which
sounds too much like the original, and a pretty non-descript
track called Social Circles which sounds like it could have been
made using a Commodore 64.
