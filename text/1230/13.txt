Events
Shaft
70's wibbly stuff with
overtones of CHEESE. I
love cheese. So fragrant,
and if you leave it in the
sun long enough, it will
evolve into a rabbit.
Union, All Night
Ummmm
I don't know what I usu-
ally put in here. Maybe
something happens. I
don't know: Leave me
alone, I'm trying to have
a nervous breakdown.

O
Not to be confused with
the story of O, which is
naughty and mildly

version of Othello, which
is apparently quite good.

Waking Life
Get stoned. Watch this.
Check... bloke meditates
on the nature of reality
in this partly animated
tale of a man trying to
teach himself how to
control his dreams. Cool.
