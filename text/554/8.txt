In 1968, a group of public schoolboys from Charterhouse,
Surrey, approached a music company with some tapes of
songs they'd written at school. Nine years later, their band
was simultaneously "Best British Band" and "Best Live
Band in the World" in the Melody Maker Readers' Poll.
This Sunday at 5, Simon Milner presents Focus on
Genesis, part one, tracing the careers of the band and its
members from 1968 to the departure of Peter Gabriel in
1975.
The second part, bringing the story up to date, will be
broadcast the following Sunday at 5.
