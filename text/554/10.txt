Practical joke
fails to amuse
Police
On Sunday residents from Weeks
Hall drew an outline of a body on the
pavement outside their Hall. The
added some tomato ketchup and
surrounded the figure with barriers.
A local resident phoned the Police
and they questioned some of the
students who live in the hall. The
Week's security guard stayed with
the students while they were being
questioned.
FINNISTON REPORT
I have had a bitterly disappointing
response to* my enquiries about the
views of the students in City and
Guilds College on the Finniston
Report. Our original plan was to
formu'ite a student response to be
sent to the Department of Industry
at the beginning of April, but with a
mere 18 replies from our 2,316
students we could hardly be
representative, but IT IS N O T
TOO LATE.
Mr Richard Morris, who is to
organise the conference on Engineer-
ing Education, the offical reply to
Finniston, to be held in October,
has expressed a keen interest to
hear our students' views and so we
are once again aiming to produce a
student response.
So please keep your comments,
criticisms, and ideas on the Finniston
Report rolling into the Guilds
Union Office, Mech Eng Dept
anytime until the end "of term. It is
obviously important that we, as
students of the foremost engineering
institution in the country, voice our
opinon effectively.
Thank You

Massive scores
on Asteroids
machine
On Wednesday night, students
scored a high set of points on the
Asteroids machine in Southside. The
above photograph of the top ten high
scores table shows that IC students
are getting pretty good at the game.
When will we challenge other
London colleges?
EDITORIAL
The incident, last Saturday,
indicates how easy it is for
unauthorised people to get into
Southside. The architectural design
of the building adds to the problem.
There are 3 entrances and it is almost
impossible to stop a determined
person from entering the building.
Moving on to other less serious
events. The FELIX Motor Rally takes
place on Sunday 15th June.
If you are interested, please
contact your C C U President. The
Rally takes the form of a simple
treasure hunt round London. Teams
of 2 to 5 members. The winning team
have their nan.es enscribed on the
FELIX Rally pot in the Union Bar. I
would like to thank Martin Watson
for his help in organising the event.
Last Tuesday the ICU A G M voted
that ICU should buy 200 copies per
week of London Student next year.
The paper hoped that we would buy
more and London Student will need
to have many large orders from other
colleges if it is to survive.
What do think of London
Student? Please write to FELIX
with your views.
Thank-you to Marie-Therese,
Jeremy Nunns and Tim Hillyer for
paste ups. Ian for impatiently waiting
for eight hours while we rearranged
the front page. Once again Mickie
lias been a great help with printing
photographs. Steve Groves has been
helping print up pics for the review of
the year. On page 3 of this issue I
have included one of the photos from
the Rugby tour of Holland .... there'll
be lots more special photos in the
review of the year!
Cheers to Justin Newland for
writing another article this week.
Mark Smith enjoyed 'The Empire
Strikes Back' and 1 hope you do too.
Congratulations to everyone who
was awarded colours.

The Badge Soc Bit
The Badge Society A G M took
place last Friday in the Bridge
Room, as the Green Committee
Room was shut. The attendance
wasn't quite as high as expected
with many of our keener members
being unable to make it. However,
the elections went without hitch
with the following people taking the
major posts unopposed.
Chairthingy - me
Secretary - Dave Postill
Treasurer - Dave Greenwood
The remaining two posts, Co-
ordinating Committee members,
will be decided at the first general
meeting of next term. Membership
for next year will be on sale soon,
price 50p, and there will also be a
competition to design the members
badge, so get thinking!
Have Fun.

The Fox Strikes Back
Inarticulate—Life in aFox hole
" A n d now," as Frank (the blue-eyed one)
has oft s a i d , " t h e e n d is n e a r " . L a s t
Tuesday's A G M , although heralding that
occurrence is not however the finale. I'm
still pressy until the end of J u n e , which
m e a n s I still h a v e to w o r k a n d w r i t e
F E L I X articles (or inarticles).
Firstly, I must express my sorrow and
hbrror over the occurrence last Saturday.
A n y a c t i o n t h a t n o w f o l l o w s w i l l be
shutting the stable door after the horse
h a s b o l t e d , b u t it is i m p o r t a n t t h a t
Southside and Beit are now made more
s e c u r e . C o l l e g e are c u r r e n t l y m a k i n g
internal investigations, I C U C o u n c i l has
called for a Rector's W o r k i n g Party to be
set up immediately to m a k e r e c o m m e n -
dations by the e n d of June. In the mean
time it lies with the residents of Halls and
H o u s e s , m a l e a n d f e m a l e , to be b o t h
m o r e vigilant a n d m o r e c a r e f u l . T h e r e
must be no further repeats of incidents of
this kind.
Staff
O n e of my jobs as President, which not
many people realise is as an employer.
I n c l u d i n g t h e F E L I X staff, t h e u n i o n
employs seven people, all of w h o m are
excellent, thereby rendering my job far
easier than it might be. This is just to
remind y o u , that whether you be in the
U n i o n Office, the Welfare C e n t r e or the
F E L I X Office to treat those people who
maintain the Union, despite people like
me, with the respect they deserve. Failure
to do so in the past has led to disciplinary
action.
Council
C o u n c i l last M o n d a y , as well as exceeding
itself in t e r m s of n a s t i n e s s (my fault),
discussed the U n i o n reply to a letter from
Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer who is chairing
a Flowers-type working party on the non-
medical bits of the University of L o n d o n .
C o u n c i l decided that it would like IC to
stay in U of L and that there should be
m u c h closer academic interaction between
the schools.
It t h e n w e n t o n t o s p e n d h o u r s
discussing Finniston and U L U , at which
p o i n t C o u n c i l b e c a m e i n q u o r a t e a n d
ended.
Before the end C o u n c i l had discussed
boats and S o u t h Africans, the proposal
by College to build a new hall of residence
at Silwood which the residents are not
too keen about, and lots of other things.
WUS Third World Scholarship
N o t e s w e r e sent to all a c a d e m i c staff
asking for donations so far the response
h a s b e e n g o o d s o k e e p t h e c h e q u e s
rolling in.

M a n y congratulations to all those who
were awarded C o l o u r s at the A G M and
especial congrats to M a l c o l m , Wodger,
T i m and Bill for getting U G A ' s (the top
award).
O h well back to the Office.
