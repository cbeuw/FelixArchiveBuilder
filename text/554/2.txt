Boat Club
Dear Colin
I would like to publicise Steve
Webb's (the captain of Boat Club)
comment to me as his justification
for challenging the quorum as the
motion censoring the recent action
of the Boat Club was about to be
voted upon.
His comment: " T h i s isn't a
representative meeting — she goes
and drags all the overseas students
in".
Firstly, the "she" refers to Mary
Attenborough, as if this issue was
her personal axe to grind. In fact,
the Anti-Apartheid Group at IC
numbers about thirty people,
which, I should think is a number
not far removed from the number
of active members of Boat Club,
and we are joining an international
campaign to break links with the
racist regime of South Africa.
Secondly, Steve seems to assume
that the overseas students were
forced to attend the meeting, that
they cannot make up their minds
for themselves and that their vote
does not carry the same weight as
that of the home student. For the
first time that I can remember, we
had a large contingent of overseas
students at a UGM because they
wanted to show how strong their
feelings were about the issue being
discussed — why else did they
bother to attend the meeting? This
is surely the type of response we
are aiming at by holding UGMs.
Steve has so far argued that his
way is the best way to alleviate the
situation in South Africa and up
until the uttering of those two
phrases, even I thought he really
believed that and I merely felt
sorry. But now I realise that he just
doesn't care — "Steve's alright,
Jack."

Noise
Dear Sir
Sunday 18 May, 02:10am
As I pen this letter three hours
after retiring to bed, I am regaled
by the sounds of boogie-woogie
and rock'n'roll music from the
Union Building opposite my room.
Who decided to allow parties till
this hour in the morning during
exams? I know, it's the weekend
and we poor Beit residents must
expect to put up with some disturb-
ance (loud music, empty beer cans
and kegs being kicked and rolled
round the Quad, etc), but 2:00am?
How many more such events are
planed for our delight during the
exam period I wonder?
Yours sleeplessly

Dear Colin
May I suggest that the Editor of
FELIX issues guidelines on how to
construct a logical argument, in
order to avoid the nine letters
which rambled on to no purpose
on Iran in last week's issue.

Could you please ask your Islamic
readers not to write on our College

thing in Tehran, but certainly not in
London.

From the Anti-Anti-Apartheid
Group/Masses at RSM(IC)
Following the IC Boat Club's
successful and prestigious sporting
tour of non-racist South Africa, we
were pleased to learn that RSM
(IC) has offered RSM(IC) Union
equipment ot a non-racist white
South African team visiting the UK
this summer to row at Henley.
In view of the progressive inter-
national campaign tg promote
sporting links with the enlightened
non-racist sporting community of
South Africa, we totally endorse
the Boat Club's sporting offer.
We are considering holding a
RSM(IC) non-racist U G M to discuss
this further in PO Box 645 Joburg
RSA during July; come and vote
for the anti-anti-apartheid revolu-
tionary government at IC.

ConSoc
Dear Colin
Following the much publicised
intent of Mary Attenborough to
stand as Conservative Society
Chairman, the Consoc Committee
cordially invite her to do so
provided Mark Clegg (Consoc
Chairman) is invited to become
ICWA President for the coming
year. We feel she will be as welcome
in Consoc as Clegg will be in
ICWA.

Rediculous
Spelling
Dear Colin
Your spelling is rediculous.

Dear Colin
IC and South Africa
As one who has been at various
times described by Sennet as "a
Conservative" and by Ms Atten-
borough as a "McCarthyite Fascist",
I find it rather amusing to be
described by the Captain of IC
Boat Club as one of "Mary Atten-
borough's cronies". IC's growing
involvement with the South African
regime is rather less amusing. It is
a pity that the apartheid system
should have as an advocate in your
columns someone so ignorant of
the facts (re South African education)
or at least guilty of terminological
inexactititude (eat your heart out, J
Newland).
To return to the serious points:
there are no mixed-race univer-
sities in the Republic. A very small
Iran
Dear Colin
The current interest in the
Iranian situation from members of
this college seems somewhat
misdirected in view of the plight of
minorities in Iran. The most violent
repression is occurring now in
Kurdistan. Kurdish cities have been
indiscriminately bombed in an
attempt to 'crush the rebels' as
Khomeini has ordered. He has no
qualms about using the military
might built up by his predecessor
for his own imperialistic adventures.
A problem closer to the hearts of
students is that of attacks on
universities. Many students were
murdered only recently in a number
of universities during violent
clashes. Now examinations are
being taken early as the universities
are to be closed down because of
disagreements between university
authorities and government. The
students of this college could make
an effective protest to the Iranian
government by passing a motion in
the UGM condemning the persec-
ution of students and attacks on
the higher education system. A
telegram should then be sent to
President Bani-Sadr informing him
of the opinion of the Union.
Yours sincerely

number of non-whites are admitted
to courses in certain technical
subjects at white universities, but
are not allowed the social benefits
of full membership of the university.
These courses are not offered by
the poorly-funded non-white colleges,
which cannot of course afford
rowing clubs.
It is ironic that Imperial College
is offering collaboration with the
South African nuclear industry,
when a recently graduated Oxford
PhD is now under house arrest for
alleged spying on the installations
of that industry. In the context of
the SA-Israeli H-bomb project,
such collaboration is against the
policy of the UK government. I am
all for academic freedoms, but I
would urge the Dean of City and
Guilds to consult the Foreign
Office on this matter.
For reasons which I would be
glad to explain to any Physics
undergraduate (perhaps a good
comprehensive paper question for
next year?) the characteristic X-ray
emission of a 4 kilot on atmospheric
nuclear explosion is unmistakeable
The detection of this signature by
the Vela test-ban monitoring
satellite last September, during a
South African naval exercise,
shows how far this project has
progressd. Are we (as a College)
prepared to assist in the production
of a nuclear arsenal in a Fascist
country?
