CRICKET
IC SUNDAY XI vs BAYGREEN
Skipper Price won the toss for the sixth
consecutive time, this time using the
double-tailed coin to maintain his
unbeaten run this season (despite
winning the toss every game, though,
he's only won one match, drawn one,
and lost the rest). He elected to bat on
a beautiful summer's afternoon.
Forshaw soon sacrificed his wicket by
being stumped for 1. Then Chadwick
came in and dominated an hour long
partnership of 72 with his contribution
of 15. Meanwhile at the other end,
Stantiford was showing a bit more
calm and composure with his batting.
He took 58 minutes to reach his 50,
being dropped only once on the long-
on b o u n d a r y . He was joined by
Morton after Chadwick was caught,
and the crowd were treated to two
vastly different styles of batting.
Stantiford was punishing the bowling
with his usual textbook-style shots
whilst Morton, showing his forming
background demonstrated most of the
shots that you wouldn't find in textbooks.
Stantiford reached his 100 in just two
hours and finally finished up with 127
N O, including four 6s and twelve 4s
whilst Morton scraped a meagre 61 N
O in his ninety minutes at the crease.
Consequently Price was able to
declare at 210 for 2 at ten (reluctantly,
though, because he had lost the two
games in which he had previously
declared).

Senkiw and Morton opened the
throwing after ten. The former, although
ageing, showed plenty of class and
was most unlucky not to get a wicket
in his opening spell. The latter,
Morton, with a wider variety of short
balls and long hops down the leg side
managed to pick up the wicket caught
by his partner Stantiford behind the
stumps. The next bowler brought into
the fray was tennis player, Middelboe.
He boweld with great spirit, if not skill
and took a wicket in his mammoth
four over stint. Next we were treated
to a truly breathtaking display of the
art of spin-bowling, by Myers and
Price. Myers bowled over 11 overs, 1
for 30, the wicket being a diving catch
by the skipper at mid-off. Price,
keeping his spinning ball for every
10th over, managed with deceptive use
of flight and pace to take four wickets
for 44 runs off 15 overs, all of them
being cuaght off half volleys just
outside the off stump. Despite these
breakthroughs and the re-introduction
of Senkiw into the attack, Baygreen
held on to a draw and finished on 137
for 7. Forshaw helped Baygreen by
very ably dropping 2 catches in the
slips off Senkiw's bowling. The evening
was crudely rounded off by Morton,
Stantiford and Middelboe suggesting
various poetic phrases for the skipper to
write on his 'good luck' card to, as
Morton, put it, his 'passion flower'!
Team (only 10): Price, Morton,
Stantiford, Maguire, Clark, Chadwick,
Senkiw, Myers, Middelboe and Forshaw.

IC may have lost University Chal-
lenge, but C & G Aerosoc won
Aeronautical Challenge.
Aeronautical Challenge is an
annual competition run by the
Graduate and Students Section of
the Royal Aeronautical Society with
the same format as University
Challenge.
Teams of three, from each of the
four London sub-sections (Imperial,
Queen Mary, City and Kingston
Poly) competed against each other,
answering questions on aeronautical
subjects.
In the first round Imperial beat
Kingston Poly by 170 to 50 points
and in the final we beat City by 130
to 60 points.
The team consisted of Mike
Napier (Aero 2), Paul Butcher
(Aero 2) and Huw Robert (Aero 2).
Once again, this confirms the high
standing of Aeronautics students at
IC.

BOAT
CLUB
Nottingham City Regatta
Over the weekend, the majority of the
Boat Club were competing in the Two
Day Nottingham City Regattas, held
on the Glare international course at
the National Watersports Centre.
The 1st VIII had a weekend of mixed
fortunes. Competing in the Senior 'A'
event on Saturday, their only opposition
came from Durham University. However,
the crew had a bad row and were
beaten by about two lengths. Sunday,
however, was a different story, and
despite being down in the first part of
their final they rowed well, and
eventually rowed through to win by
just over a length'from Lady Margaret
BC Cambridge.
The 2nd VIII, qualified easily for the
final of the Senior ' C Vllls event, by
finishing third in their heat. A good
start gave them an early lead in the
final, which they increased throughout
the race, to win by about three to four
lengths. On Sunday, suffering from
the night before, and competing in a
higher class, they were fifth in the
Senior 'B' Vllls final.
The most unfortunate competition of
the weekend was novice Sculler
Alistair Rowe. On Saturday he finished
second In his final and seemed about
certain to win the same event on
Sunday. However, with about a minute
to go in Sunday's final, as he was
taking the lead, equipment failure
robbed him of victory.
The Ladies Senior 'B' IV, had a very
hard race with a Hereford RC crew in
their Saturday final, but just managed
to hold them off to win by about half a
length. On Sunday, they had to row in
the Unclassified IVs event, where they
came up against a potential inter-
national crew from Thames RC. The
girls rowed well to keep in touch for
the first half of the race, eventually
losing by about four lengths to
Thames, but beating a Nottingham BC
crew.
A Ladies Seniro ' C IV and a Ladies
Novice IV were also entered for the
Sunday event, but neither of the crews
rowed as well as they can, with the
Senior ' C IV losing to a very good
Wallingford School crew.
