Despite the avalanche of post Star
W a r s rip-offs, the sequel must be one
of the most eagerly awaited films of
all time. F o r those of y o u who
enjoyed the original, I can assure y o u
that T h e Empire won't be in the
least disappointing.
The original cast return in their
familiar roles along with a few
interesting newcomers. D a r t h V a d e r ,
having survived the destruction of the
Death Star, is out for revenge. H e
eventually finds the secret rebel base
on the ice planet H o t h , where L u k e ,
H a n , the Princes, et al are hiding.
They are attacked in spectacular style
by hugh mechanical walking 'tanks' â€”
a real triumph for the effects team of
George Lucas. In the confusion L u k e
takes R2-D2 off to the m a r s h world
of Dagobah, where he is tutored by
Y o d a , an 800 year old Jedi master.
Y o d a is no strapping hero though;
the character was created by M u p p e t
man Frank O z and is rather like a
cross between G o n z o the G r e a t and
a hobbit.
Meanwhile the others escape in the
Millenium Falcon through an asteroid
storm, again utilising a series of
magnificent special effects. Their paths
eventually converge on the cloud city
of B e s p i n , w h e r e D a r t h V a d e r finally
confronts L u k e .
Luke Skywalker rides a tauntaun on the ice planet Hoth.
The newcomers are L a n d o Calrissian,
an old friend of H a n Solo and
the mercenary B o b a Fett. L a n d o turns
out to be quite a hero, but little is made
of B o b a Fett who will obviously figure
prominently in the next episode of the
saga.
In true Star W a r s style, the plot is
a non-stop action r o m p which
pretends to be nothing but entertaining.
A little love interest filters in, but to
my mind the outstanding strongpoint
of the film is the special effects. T h e
wooden acting pales into insignificance
when supported by the stunning
Darth Vader confronts Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett.
illusions, which are created by G e o r g e
Lucas' company, Industrial Light and
Magic. The spacecraft weave in and
out of asteroids and swoop d o w n
into craters; -the dinosaur-like taun-

H o t h a n d sparks fly as light sabers
clash again. A l l great stuff.
Finally, the confusing bit. If you
thought Star W a r s was the beginning
of the saga then you're wrong; L u c a s
is planning a NINE part saga in
which Star W a r s and The Empire are
parts 4 and 5. These will be followed
by "Revenge O f T h e J e d i " , part 6.
T h e n two other trilogies are planned;
1 to 3 explain Vader's development
and 7 to 9 will probably be the
downfall of the Empire. It's difficult to
see how long the appeal will last, but
at the moment I can't wait to see
the next instalment. S o until the
Revenge O f The Jedi . . . .

Foreign Oskar Winners
Two other films well worth mentioning are The
Tin Drum (X, Odeon Haymarket) and Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs (X, Curzon), both
of which won oscars for the best foreign film.
The former concerns the development of Nazi
Germany as seen through the eyes of Oskar, a
three year old boy of uncanny talents. Not only
does he refuse to grow up, but he has a glass
shattering scream. The film is quite fascinating,
but drags in places.
Better, however, is the latter. A young man
decides to give his wife away to another man in
order to make her smile, which eventually
leads to further affairs with a neighbour and
then a very nasty child genius,
stylish and at times very
enjoyable, indeed.
The humour is
subtle. Very
