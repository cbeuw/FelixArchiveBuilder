Editorial comment (back page)
The rape of a female student in
Southside is the most serious incident
that I have had to report in FELIX.
I was on the scene moments after the
incident occurred and have full
knowledge of the incident. However, I
have not included many details of the
rape in this week's FELIX because I
believe that it would be wrong to do so.
The priority is to help the POLICE
apprehend the rapist before he is given
the chance to strike again.
