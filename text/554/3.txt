Studentae Imperialis
a review of the species
The average visitor to South Kensington rarely
concerns himself with anything other than one
or m o r e of the n u m e r o u s m u s e u m s , or
perhaps the Albert Hall. It is easy, amongst the
grandiose Victorian architecture, to overlook
the shabby, inconspicuous inhabitants of the
area. More than a casual glance, however, will
soon reveal the exciting variety of creatures to
be found. One of the most interesting of these
is Studentae imperialis. It is only recently that
biologists have been able to describe this
species, and I present here a review of the
work so far.
Studentae imperialis is confined to the South
K e n s i n g t o n a r e a , where there is a total
population of 4,000 individuals. Because there
is great variation in appearance, behaviour and
habitat, five sub-species, or variants, have been
described.
The 'type' species is normalis. This is the
most common variety, comprising 80-90% of
the population, and is believed to be the most
primitive. Normalis is a placid, dull creature. It
a v o i d s c r o w d s , a n d p r e f e r s w a r m , safe
environments such as lecture theatres and
libraries. Males and females are difficult to
distinguish, due to their similar habits of dress.
However, males do vastly outnumber females.
The result of this unbalanced distribution of
the sexes is that a high proportion of normalis
males have poor eyesight and have to wear
s p e c t a c l e s . A l t h o u g h solitary by n a t u r e ,
normalis occasionally joins a group of five to
ten individuals to form a 'clique'. These cliques
are uncommunicative and withdrawn when
confronted by other individuals, and can often
be seen sitting by themselves in a circle in a
c o m m o n r o o m or bar. T h e s e g r o u p s are
extremely boring, and the keen naturalist
should not waste time observing them.
The most common variant after normalis is
socialus, which accounts for between ten and
t w e n t y p e r c e n t of the p o p u l a t i o n . T h i s
colourful variant is friendly and affectionate.
They are more adaptable than normalis, and
have a consequently more diverse habitat.
Rarely found in libraries, socialus can often be
found in bars, pubs, or the noisy crowded
places which normalis avoids. T h i s variant
would undoubtedly increase in numbers and
bring about the extinction of normalis if it were
not for the activity of the predator Examiner
imperialis. This seasonal creature appears for a
month in the early summer. W h e r e a s the
habitat and behaviour of normalis makes it
unappetising to the predator, poor socialus is
highly vulnerable, and the population may
be drastically reduced. (Indeed, the fear of the
predator may be so great that a socialus
i n d i v i d u a l m a y s p o n t a n e o u s l y revert to a
normalis, becoming just as drab and boring,
and frequenting the same habitats.) Unlike
n o r m a l i s , where c o p u l a t i o n is u n k n o w n ,
socialus may practice a primitive form of
sexual reproduction. The production of young
is rare.
Three other small but important varieties
have been observed. The largest of these is
vulgaris. This evolved from socialus, but is
u n d o u b t e d l y d e g e n e r a t e . T h e r e are one
hundred and fifty or so individuals, each having
its own distinctive behaviour pattern. Vulgaris,
which is often found in the U n i o n B a r , is
m o r p h o l o g i c a l l y d i s s i m i l a r to the o t h e r
varieties, usually being thick-set and rather
ugly. One interesting feature is that the right
arm may be better developed than the left.
This may be due to the unusual diet, which is
high in liquid content. Other authorities believe
that, like the eyesight of normalis males, it is
due to the relative scarcity of females. Vulgaris
c a n be one one of the most interesting
creatures for the,keen naturalist to study. One
of Nature's most delightful spectacles is to see
a vulgaris individual bend his head towards the
ground, to hear the distinctive gurgle-splash-
gurlge splash sound that indicates that he is
having, or rather, has just had, a good time.
There are only four individuals of the fourth
variant, Sabbaticalus. They have a short life-
cycle of only one year. Nothing useful can be
said about them, other than that they make a
lot of noise, out of all proportion to their size.
The rarest variant is the much sought after
Eroticus. These females are highly attractive to
males of all the other varieties. T h e y are
extremely rare, and a live individual has not
been recorded for many years. Some authorities
claim the variety is extinct, and others claim it
is a mythical creature that has never existed
outside the warped minds of socialus and
vulgaris males. It is claimed, however, that
there is a stuffed specimen in the Natural
History Museum. This is hard to believe, since
it is well e s t a b l i s h e d that it is v i r t u a l l y
impossible to stuff such a female.
In summary, it can be seen that Studentae
imperialis is an extremely interesting creature.
So, for an exciting day out with the kids, get
out the car and drive down Prince Consort
Road. Remember, keep the windows closed,
don't get out of the car, and definitely do not
feed them!

article w o u l d probably be my last, my a r m
has been slightly twisted and a typewriter
put in front of me, so here it is.
T h e Seaside T r i p on S a t u r d a y was well
attended with negative e m p t y seats being
available on the c o a c h . T h e weather was
very g o o d w h e n we left Beit A r c h but a
few clouds appeared as we a p p r o a c h e d
our destination. Y e s it was M a r g a t e . O n
arrival the first task was to sample the
sea and a few stalwart (foolish) m e m b e r s
of G u i l d s rushed towards the sea. T h e y
r u s h e d away from the sea pretty quickly
as well due to t e m p e r a t u r e d e p e n d e n t
shortening effects although s o m e people
m a n a g e d to stay in the sea. A s n o r m a l ,
o n c e everybody had left the sea the sun
decided to c o m e out and the rest of the
day was rather good. After a few pints
and s o m e greasy fish and chips we all
went off to the fun fair to try and find a
way to get rid of the food. M o s t of the
rides were tried. J o liked one so m u c h
s h e w a s s e e n s t a g g e r i n g a w a y f r o m it
after having-had two rides. M o s t people's
o v e r d r a f t s w e r e c o n s i d e r a b l y i n c r e a s e d
and a g o o d time was had by all. I don't
r e m e m b e r m u c h of the return trip as I
fell asleep until we r e a c h e d the pub on
the way back.
N o w on to an event you will probably
not k n o w about. A s we have collected
about £18,200 this year for Rag, it was
d e c i d e d at R a g C o m m i t t e e that it w o u l d
be a terrifically spiffing idea if we c o u l d
increase this total to over £20,000. T o this
e n d t h e r e w i l l be a final m a s s i v e R a g
c o l l e c t i o n o n 14th J u n e . D o n ' t w o r r y ,
most people's e x a m s will have finished so
there is no reason for not turning up.
