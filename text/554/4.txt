A Modest Reply From Justin Newland
Two weeks ago, an essay entitled
"The American-Iranian Conflict:
Some Historical Perspectives"
appeared in this magazine (FELIX
Issue No 552, dated 9th May 1980).
The following week, a number of
letters criticising my article were
published in FELIX. I should like to
thank the Editor for allowing me
this opportunity to reply to these
criticisms.
First of all, I humbly apologise to
any and all Muslims whom I may
have offended by describing their
religion as Mohammedism, rather
than Islam. This was entirely due to
my ignorance.
Now, the letter from Islamic
Society kindly informs us that "the
teachings of Islam . . . regard men
and women ps equal before God".
While the italics are theirs, I would
be more inclined to emphasise the
word "regard". Perhaps Islam
regards equality in such a way that
it bears an uncanny resemblance to
gross inequality? Have you ever
seen a Muslim man wearing a veil?
Nonetheless, I did admire the
nimble dexterity with which they
have exploited the current situation:
in the same letter, they tell us that
"the aim" of sending us all their
religious propaganda was not to
disseminate the Muslim faith, but
on the contrary, "was to clear
many misconceptions about Islam,
common in England". Indeed, I was
interested to read in their 'Brief
Guild to Islam' that "from dawn to
sunset every day for thirty consecu-
tive days . . . a Muslim voluntarily
gives up eating, drinking and sexual
habits". I wonder if they could
explain why, in some Muslim
countries, this "voluntary" activity
is supported by legislation.
Yet I fully realise that this is a
captious objection to a faith which
is a magnificent spiritual sanctuary,
but whose articles, like those of
Christianity, are being insistently
questioned.
Two critics commented on my
literary style. May I ask them, was
my essay merely a piece of prose,
and nothing else? If so, then all
criticisms should have been aesthetic,

or judgements on the form, rather
than intellectual or logical, or
judgements on the content. But my
article was not a poem; it was a
serious attempt to examine the
current American-Iranian struggle
from both sides and to draw some
historical analogies. Therefore, any
aesthetic comments should have
been supplementary to a review of
the content of my work, and
should have been confined to a
single issue: whether the style was
appropriate to the content.
If I am to understand their
aesthetic judgements correctly,
writers in FELIX should use no
metaphor, similie, or any literary
embellishment save cliches, and
God forbid if they should ever
quote any foreign words and
annotate these with their meanings.
And eternal damnation to an
author whose vocabulary forces
his readers to pore over a dictionary.
On a personal note, I cannot
believe that my essay offended Ms
Ann-Marie Tomsett as much as her
spiteful, vindictive letter wounded
me.
However, this same lady suggested
that my essay should have been
entitled "The American-Iranian
Conflict: Some Personal Historical
Perspectives". Allied to her objection
that my work was " . . . opinionated
. . . verbal tenesmus" (what the hell
does that mean?), these arguments
may seem like those of a fool
whose bolt is soon shot. In fact,
they raise an important issue. For
example is the historical perspecitive
called dialectical materialism (n.b. if
I explain this theory, I'll be accused
of verbosity, if not, then pomposity) a
universal law, or merely one
personal interpretation of history? I
had always thought of looking at
history as similar to looking at a
panorama: some folk pick out this
aspect, this detail, this tree, or this
leaf, while others see the valley, the
forest, and the landscape as a
whole. Either way, the view is
individual, and therefore bound to
be opinonated.

a Mr Stephen Goulder concerned
my "libellous" accusation that the
Western media is notoriously
biased. I should say here that, as a
good citizen, I believe everything I
read in newspapers, down to the
last monosyllable in the Sun. How
can the British Press be slandered
in such a way when, for example,
just recently they unerringly
explained to the curious British
public just why the Day of Action
had been called? God forbid! It
would be like accusing these
honourable journalists of distracting
the attention of the public from the
central issue (ie, the present
administration's iniquitous policies)
by creating a ballyhoo about Len
Murray's holiday.
Indeed, the same critic thought
that my conclusion "we must look
beyond . . . the framework of
international law for the eventual
resolution of this crisis", did not
account for the presence of the
UN to deal with such situations.
Well, I suppose they have managed
it so well that they have already
resolved the conflict, but are
keeping it a secret for the time
being? Like its illustrious prede-
cessor, the League of Nations,
whose mere existence did so much
to halt the onset of the Second
World War, the United Nations has
feathered its cap by preventing the
Suez crisis, the Korean and Vietnam
wars, and a couple of Middle-East
wars to boot. Seriously though, I
accept that the U N may help
resolve international quarrels once
they have arisen, but are their
conventions universally recognised,
or, more to the point, are they
never broken?
However, it was this alert gentle-
man who alone raised any fresh
questions on the content of my
essay. His realistic analysis, as far
as it went, was excellent, but in
some places, dogmatic. At one
point, he states that: "If the
Americans agreed to the terms
demanded this would then put
every foreign embassy in the world
at risk." Here he fails to establish

the principle motive of the Iranian
students in occupying the American
Embassy in Tehran; originally, this
was to force the US to extradite
the ex-Shah back to Iran, where he
would face a treason trial. Inciden-
tally, new evidence seems to
suggest that one reason the Amer-
icans refused to comply with this
demand was that the ex-Shah had
enormous dollar holdings in the
US
While I do not have the space to
comment on some other pertinent
criticisms raised by Mr Goulder, I
will say this: in my opinion, it is
now irrelevant whether the Ameri-
cans accede to the terms of the
Iranian students, in so far as the
current vogue in terrorism has
shifted from plane-hijacking to
attacking embassies.
Finally, any discerning reader of
my original article will have realised
that I deliberately adopted a stance
of non-alignment; hence thecriticisms
levelled against me by both sides. I
repeat my claim that the one
positive common factor shared by
the American and Iranian people is
that they are each and all members
of the human race. Thus it is the
springs of humanism that must
eventually join these, and all,
peoples together.
At the risk of provoking-
the
derision and hostility of some of my
readers, I will couch my concluding
remarks in a figure of speech.
It is only when every country's
belief in the UN, or some other
institution embodying the principles
of humanism, has been nourished
by the rains of time that the flower
of universal peace and equality will
prosper.
Until then, we must endure the
stench of wars, the sickness of the
Third World, the starvation of
millions, and the most nauseous
sight on this earth . . .the suffering
of children.
