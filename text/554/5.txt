J U S T A S E C
Thank you all for turning up to the Annual General
Meeting, it was indeed good to see the place full.
The social and athletic awards, which were announced
then, are printed in this edition of FELIX. If you ai;e on the
list you may purchase from the Bookshop a tie or pendant.
However, don't rush along now, wait for a certificate to be
sent to you in the internal post. This must be presented
when you go to buy it. Congratulations to you all.
Union General Awards were presented to Chris Fox,
Malcolm Brain, Bill Robertson (Senior Assistant Registrar
at College since 1967), Tim Hillyer and myself.
Your comments on the French kids completely backed
up my own thoughts. " A pain in the arse" was the phrase I
heard most around Southside. Since then I have taken the
matter to the Union Council Meeting, held last Monday,
and the Union does not support any profit making venture
which* is to the inconvenience of students. Clearly this
means the French kids if you are studying in your room for
exams. A letter has been sent to the Refectory Chairman.
I have been asked to inform you that members of the
College have been invited by the Mayor-elect of South
Kensington and Chelsea to attend the Civic Service at St
Mary Abbots Church at 11:15am on Sunday 1st June.
That's all for this week, except have a good Bank
Holiday.

Last Tuesday's ICU AGM was held in the Concert Hall. About 200 students
were at the meeting.
The Officer's reports were printed in a special edition of EXEC NEWS and
after these were discussed, social and athletics colours were announced.
Members of staff were then given their social colours and the Union General
Awards were presented. Â»
The post of U G M Chairman was handed over to Jon Firth and the meeting
moved on to the motions. A successful attempt was made to change the order
of the Agenda. The motion on the Boat Club (see letter from Jo Armitage on
page 2) was heard. After one speech for and against the motion, the meeting
moved to a vote. At this point the quorum was successfully chalenged and the
meeting continued in the Queens.
