This January sees the opening
of the Gilbert & Ildiko
Butler drawings gallery
at the Courtauld. The wonderful
purpose built gallery, designed
by 2013 Stirling prize winners
Witherford Watson Mann Architects,
finally gives the public a chance to see
one of the most celebrated collections
of drawings in the country. With
over 7000 works, this is a remarkable
opportunity to see a glimpse into the
overlooked riches of the Courtauld
Institute.
In this first exhibition in the new
gallery, Unseen presents a small
selection of works, all of which have
not been exhibited at the gallery in
the last twenty years. Predominantly
by lesser known artists, the works
range from the renaissance to the
twentieth century with a remarkable
breadth of subject matter and style.
Although the works of some well-
known artists are presented including
Rubens and Henry Moore, the true
delight of this exhibition is the
number of works which show styles
and technique often centuries before
their time.
Caricature of three Ecclesiastics
by the high baroque painter Pier
Francesco Mola (1612 - 1666) is one
of the most captivating works I have
very come across. In this highly
stylised caricature, Mola depicts
a fattened bishop begging from
his comparatively malnourished
cardinal. With the pope seated in
the background, this profound
satirical image not only feels like
a work from the 20th
century but
could comfortably be shown in any
satirical magazine today and not
feel out of place. A sketch which
couldn’t have taken the artist more
than ten minutes, the image gives
a remarkably deep insight into
religious tensions throughout Mola’s
career.
Shown by Mola’s caricature
and a number of other works, the
exhibition is particularly successful
in highlighting the artistic freedom
drawing offers artists.
At a time where the majority of
major works were produced for the
aristocracy or the church, sketches
could often touch on subjects that
larger works couldn’t. This is why
Mola’s incredibly modern caricature
is so profound.
Other pieces such as Valentin
Klotz’ 1675 work View of Grave
graphically depicts the destruction
following a siege against the heavily
damaged church of St. Elizabeth
in the background. With the
foreground littered with a number
of cubic houses, delineated with
nervous pen, the work shows a
fascinating combination of realism
and impressionism. Like Mola’s
caricature, the modernity of Klotz’
structures seem to be from another
time, not reflecting what is typically
expected from the late 17th century.
The exhibition also displays a
number of more typical works
including a number of including a
study of the female head and a 1962
work by Larry Rivers, the “godfather”
of pop-art. While beautiful in their
own right, they do not offer quite
the same surprise that a number of
the lesser works do. However, as a
collective, the pieces exhibited are a
christening for this wonderful new
space at the Courtauld. Spacious
and incredibly well lit, the new
gallery fills a gap in the Courtauld’s
repertoire and will give the public
another gem to see when visiting the
institute.

Ahipster little theatre in
Kilburn. A cast of young
actors. An improvised piece
on the meaning of life. As far as hints
go, the Secret Theatre production
of A Series of Increasingly Impossible
Acts hadn’t got me too fired up. And
yet, despite my initial reticence, I
was completely blown away by what
proved to be a brave, hilarious and
heart wrenching show.
The Secret Theatre formed a few
years back when the Lyric Theatre in
Hammersmith was undergoing huge
building works. In order to continue
putting on shows ten young actors
joined up to create unusual shows, in
which the audience would turn up not
knowing what would be performed or
where it would be performed within
the building site. It turned out to be
a huge success and the company has
carried on producing shows in much
the same way, despite the fact that
they know have a fully-constructed
theatre.
Confusingly, London has another
Secret Theatre company (Secret
Theatre London) which veils its
shows in mysteries and forbids
reviews from spilling the beans.
Prepared for total secrecy, I was
surprised to see that a quick Google of
A Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts
returned reviews openly sharing the
main outline was being referred to
openly: a cast member gets chosen by
the audience to undertake difficult,
unpleasant or impossible tasks on
stage.
What’s the point of a secret if
everyone knows it already? Perhaps a
better name would be the Unexpected
theatre — it wasn’t the show’s
format which was a surprise, but the
emotional charge it carried.
On the night I went, Leo Bill’s
name was drawn out of the hat, and
he proceeded to be subjected to a
farcical fitness circuit: bending iron
bars, licking his elbow, eating lemons.
This lap was repeated throughput
the show, a symbol of the change
the actor was undergoing under our
eyes. He was assaulted, offended,
hurt, helped, teased, embarrassed and
kissed by the rest of the cast, as the
performance turned into a journey
of discovery of the actor. The journey
was subtle and natural, with moments
of comedy punctuating an otherwise
very moving and touching show. By
the end of it I really felt as if I knew
Leo very intimately – his hopes and
his humour, but mainly his fears,
insecurities and wounds, which he
had laid bare in front of the audience.
Yes, of course I know that the
show was semi-rehearsed, and that
the spontaneity stemmed from the
actors’ talent rather than from them
totally opening up on stage, but the
effect it had was nevertheless truly
poignant. The real physical duress
the actor undergoes strengthens the
emotional upheaval you seem them
go through – the dialogue may well
be contrived, but you can’t fake the
acidity of a raw lemon, the cold of an
ice bucket or sweaty, shaky muscles
after a wrestling match.
Somehow, through all the silliness,
the Secret Theatre has managed to do
what all theatre strives to do – they
struck on something true. Something
that resonates at some deep level,
by showing you that this is life.
This chaotic, difficult, loving, scary,
pointless and beautiful thing is life.
The Secret Theatre will perform all
of their 6 shows between the 12th
of
February and the 1st of March at the
Lyric in Hammersmith, as a farewell
before the company parts. Tickets
are £15 and I really urge you to get
yourselves some!
