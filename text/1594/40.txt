Take a look around in your
lecture hall. What do you see?
Considering that all of you are
studying at Imperial College, there
will probably be people of different
races, nationalities, ethnicities and so-
cioeconomic backgrounds all packed
into one room. Now take a closer
look. I’ll wager that there will be a
group of Chinese students bunched
together in the front. the Indians will
have congregated somewhere around
the back. There will be a whole bunch
of Europeans scattered around the
room, sitting together according to
their nationalities, and the English
will probably be found all around the
room in two’s or threes.
Although the arrangement of the
different nationalities might vary
from class to class, there is one thing
that will not; people from the same
country will invariably end up sitting
together. This national unity will
not be confined to the lecture hall;
students will usually eat, live, go out
and in general spend their entire
university lives with a small number
of people and these people will in all
likelihood be from the same region,
if not the same country. Don’t believe
me? Look closely at your own circles
and you will know that I am right.
The single most important selling
point of an international education
is the opportunity to meet and
interact with people from different
backgrounds and cultures. It is the
promise of making friends with
people from all around the world
and opening your mind to different
to things that you would never have
considered before and experiences
that you would not have otherwise
have had if you hadn’t come to live
abroad. By interacting only with
people from our own countries we are
greatly reducing our chances to grow
and develop.
I get it. Living thousands of miles
away from your friends and family is
scary and you are seeking comfort in
the familiar. There is nothing wrong
with that. Let’s face it, it’s easier to
make friends with people from the
same culture as you because you
probably have experienced the same
things, celebrate the same holidays,
have watched the same movies or
shows, eat the same kind of food and
probably have similar worldviews and
opinions. Given all the similarities
it’s easier to bond and talk to people
from the same country.
After a point though, by spending
a point with a homogenous group
of people your worldview becomes
limited and narrow. To really make
the most of your education you have
to make an effort to overcome your
fear and anxiety and move out of
your comfort zone to talk to people
who are different from you. Even if
we put personal growth aside for the
moment, the world of work today is
becoming increasingly globalized.
If we are even to survive in a global
work environment the ability to
work and make friends with people
who are different from us will be an
invaluable skill.
Now that we have the why covered
let’s move on to how you can make
friends with people from different
backgrounds.
The first and easiest way to meet
new people is by joining a society.
Societies are usually organized
around an interest or hobby, allowing
you easy access to people from all
around the world with whom you
can bond over your shared love of
whatever it is. Societies also tend to
organize fun mixers and socials to
make it easier for their members to
get to know each other in a relaxed
environment.
If you are feeling particularly brave
you can even join a cultural society
of a completely different culture. I
once knew an Indian girl who joined
the Cypriot society simply because
she was curious about Cyprus and its
culture. She got on so well with the
Cypriots that she eventually went
on to become the social exec for the
society.
The second way to meet new people
is to not form a group with your
friends for class group work. Opt,
instead, to be randomly allocated to a
group. When you enter the world of
work, you are not going to be able to
choose your team so why not try and
work with strangers and see how you
handle the challenge.
Lastly, and this is my personal
favourite, travel! Go to a new place
and explore its history and culture.
Try local foods and learn a bit more
about its folk art and stories. If
money is an obstacle there are plenty
of cheap deals for students that can
be found on the Internet. It doesn’t
matter really where or with whom
you go but only that you do go and
visit as many places as you possibly
can.
It’s human nature to be scared of
the unknown and the unfamiliar, but
don’t let that fear stop you breaking
out of your comfort zone, I can
promise you from experience that
you will never be the same once you
do!
Mental illness affects a
quarter of the population,
yet at Imperial it’s swept
under the rug. Alongside a small
group of fellow students Bethany
Davison is aiming to change this.
The new group Mentality is going to
be campaigning throughout the term
to raise awareness, reduce the stigma
surrounding mental health and, most
notably, help people to seek support
for their problems. Suffering from
mental health problems can be scary,
isolating and confusing, especially
Mentality: IC Anti-Stigma Campaign
when you feel there is nowhere to
turn. Mentality seeks to highlight and
clarify key points of access within
college when seeking help.
Additionally, Mentality hopes
to reduce the stigma surrounding
mental health and educate students
EMILY CRAMPHORN
about the importance of mental
health. They aim to do this in
numerous ways including some
activities at an upcoming stall in
Sherfield. Why not come along to
see what it’s about?
Not sure how relevant this photo is, but I couldn't find anything more adorable to get the message across.
