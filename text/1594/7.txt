Felix investigates: the admin that
didn’t remain anonymous
Felix has reason to believe that
a single student may be behind
many of the popular Imperial
Facebook pages.
We suspect the individual has
now graduated, after completing
an undergraduate degree in
Aeronautics. Felix has managed to
procure email correspondence and
personal anecdotes from a number of
students, giving us more information
on the individual behind many of
the popular pages that students are
posting to currently, and that were
active last year.
The student started at Imperial
in 2008, and has been intrinsically
linked to the now defunct Tell
Someone Something (TSS) page,
Humans of Imperial (HoI) and 4th
Floor Central Library. Felix also
suspects he was also behind Imperial
Secrets in its infancy, although we are
yet to confirm he is still the admin of
Imperial Secrets this year.
The individual was first linked to
the Imperial TSS page after making
an admin post during the last RAG
Week, asking for sponsorship under
the name “TSS Admin” to take part
in their annual bungee jump. After
approaching the stall and presenting
the funds raised through a post on the
page, he had to give the committee
his full name and CID number.
The same student was also
identified as the photographer, and
and probably the admin, of Humans
of Imperial last year, as he would
approach students and staff himself
to post their photos on the page. The
posts on HoI though are all amicable
and friendly, and ownership of the
page has since been transferred to a
team of five students still at Imperial.
For the TSS page, members of
Imperial could anonymously send in
messages via a Google form, which
were then collated and published. It
didn’t take long for the TSS page to
come under fire for its content, which
ranged from racist and sexist posts to
defamatory ones.
These included posts labelling
an individual as a “n*****r” and
“[smelling] awfully bad”, accusing a
hall warden of sniffing the underwear
of students, and asking a student with
a “fugly Indian-Chinese” partner
“what’s it like putting a piece of s***
into your vagina every night”.
Complaints made by students
about objectionable content, as well
as requests to remove said content,
were repeatedly defended under a
“freedom of speech” banner. This is
in spite of the fact that legally, the
admin of a page is responsible for all
published content under defamation
laws. At this point, the page had
amassed just under 3000 likes.
Several people whose full names
were published on the page made
use of Facebook’s “Report Abuse”
system, as well as directly messaging
the admin of TSS to remove the
posts. These were met with threats
and a spike in the targeted bullying
messages on both the page and an
affiliated Twitter account.
In one instance, when asked by one
student to remove defamatory posts
towards them, the admin became
defensive and threatened to post
more. When asked for the name(s) of
those posting the abuse, the admin
replied: “Don’t bite the hand that
feeds, dear lady. Do what you think is
right, we know we will.” A post from
the admin subsequently appeared on
TSS, encouraging those who authored
the threats to confront the victim
directly.
Following this, they continued
to post abusive and upsetting posts
concerning that student on a daily
basis before the group was shut down.

refused to censor offensive remarks

against students, comments that
questioned or were critical of the page
were swiftly moderated. At one point,
a student’s complaint regarding an
insensitive joke about the missing
MH370 flight was removed, but the
post containing the joke was allowed
to remain. A post with the same
MH370 joke is still visible on the 4th
Floor Central Library page.
The issue was escalated to ICT, with
screenshots of their conversation
with the admin included in the
complaint. However, ICT dismissed
the complaint and said there was
nothing they could do, as Facebook
pages were beyond their control.
RAG released details of the admin
to Imperial College Union to aid
with their investigation into abusive
Facebook pages. The individual was
reported to the College Tutors, a
group of department-independent
senior pastoral advisers, in a series
of emails sent from the Union. No
formal action was taken against
him, however meetings were held
between College Tutors, the Union
and students affected by the cyber-
bullying posts on the page.
While College and the Union were
collating evidence against the admin
responsible, a number of the more
offensive posts and comments started
to disappear from the TSS page. The
page admin then published an open
letter, seemingly speaking out against
bullying. However, students believed
this was an attempt by the page owner
to whitewash their actions.
Despite the Union advising against
it, following an article by The Tab
Imperial during the course of the
investigation, the Imperial TSS page
was removed from Facebook, leading
to the investigation being suspended
indefinitely. The Tab were unaware
of the progress of the Union’s
investigation, with the reporter in
question later saying that they were
not aware that the College had been
given a name from the Union.
All three pages cited here (Imperial
TSS, 4th Floor Central Library, and
Humans of Imperial) feature(d)
identical posting styles, graphical
design and use of language. These
features are also consistent with the
Imperial Secrets page.
Lastly, Imperial TSS and Imperial
Secrets bore huge similarities in how
their header graphics mimicked the
graphic identity of Imperial College,
especially in font and colour scheme.
Felix has spoken to those who
previously lived in halls with the
student believed to be behind the
pages, and also cast a net further to
find more out about his background.
The individual has been confirmed
as suffering from a number of health
issues, and often exhibited irrational
behavioural patterns.
Those in halls reported that he
was asked to move out due to a long
stint of thieving food and equipment
from the kitchens over an extended
period of time. The individual was
only caught once, as those who shared
a kitchen with him planted a camera
overnight, and repeatedly caught him
on film emptying the fridges and
cupboards.
There are also a number of reports
in the public domain about the
individual being involved in multiple
cases of theft in his home country
during a year out from Imperial,
complete with pictures. This has
subsequently led to a criminal record,
as well as a fine and jail time.
College were unable to provide us
with a reason for the suspension of
the investigation, stating that “action
taken by the College is considered
on a case-by-case basis. It would
not be appropriate to comment on
individual cases.”
We emailed the individual in
question for comment, although they
did not respond. Separate attempts to
contact the Imperial Secrets and 4th
Floor Central Library pages also went
unanswered.
