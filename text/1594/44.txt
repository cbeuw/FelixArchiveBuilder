Shock and
Disappointment
at Imperial
Themed Orgy
Hangman was shocked, and
not at all aroused, to learn
that internet sex-freaks have
been holding Imperial themed orgies
at Premier Inns up and down the
country.
Sources reveal that the rooms are
specially conditioned by pumping in
the sweat, desperation and wank-
flannel aroma of the 5th floor of the
library, before the doors are opened to
lines of socially awkward and sexually
frustrated young men desperate to
experience the no holds barred fuck-
fest that is Imperial College.
Rooms are kitted out to emulate
the campus, with bottles of aloe vera
(library Cafe standard) available close
at hand, jacket potatoes for those that
get peckish and a few live pigeons
thrown in for good luck.
Early reports from the South West
of England indicate that legendary
Imperial BNOC Kris Kraye has
been spotted in one of these dens of
Imperial iniquity, convincing the
only girl present to ‘climb on top of
his Queen’s tower’, which Hangman
has been reliably informed is ‘more
Pisa than Big Ben’, while the other
attendees awkwardly stood around,
made small talk, and offer up
mathematics based chat up lines,
although ironically, of course.
One man driven to the edge of
sanity by the sheer volume of man
available spent four hours muttering
the words “Imperial was my first
choice, it really was,” over and over
again, standing in nothing but his
socks with a red lanyard hung around
his neck.
Desperate for a taste of the sexual
thrill that is Imperial, men from
all walks of life have been donning
masks of the Felix cat and former
Rector Sir Keith O’Nions, then
sending dick pics to a mysterious
‘orgy mister.’
Several turned up and were charged
extortionate entry fees after 10pm,
which outraged a lot of the attendees.
Said one participant, “Why should I
have to pay to attend my own orgy? If
they keep up with this no-one is going
to want to take part on a Friday night
at all.”
Said another, “I’m pretty sure I
voted on the orgy survey for the
entry fees to be reduced. I swear this
happens every year! Disgraceful.”
With one in five participants
leaving the orgy without actually
having sex, some are now asking for
their money back.
Another attendee told Hangman,
“I’m usually a healthy, normal, and
sexually active person, but I’m always
looking for a new sexual thrill.
“Spending a night in a room
that smells like nightmares with
35 neckbearded men while the
only girl in the room is chatting to
someone else sounds like an amazing
experience.
I just wish there was a way I could
make it last four years, and not just
one magical night.”

Tom what he
thought about
the upcoming

“I can’t wait!”
He cheekily
grinned.
“I love a
good song
and dance
when it
comes
to men.”
Do you
think
you’re
funny? Do
you like
orgies too?
