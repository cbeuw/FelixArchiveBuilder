Send in the Clowns — A Return to Traditional Circus
Ben Howitt reviews Cirque du Soleil’s Kooza at the Royal Albert Hall
We arrived at the Royal
Albert Hall for
the Friday matinee
performance of Cirque du Soleil’s
Kooza, and almost immediately
began a mission to find somewhere
to buy the programme and video
recording. It turns out that the
Londoner’s assumption of “oh, they’ll
probably take card” does not extend
to ushers on doors at theatres – and
also that I get disoriented very easily
in circular buildings. Nevertheless,
glossy purple programme in sweaty
hand, we made our way to the Grand
Circle.
Kooza last played at the RAH in
2013, as part of its continuing world
tour. It is the 20th show that Cirque
has produced, and is described by
Guy Laliberté, one of the company’s
founders, as “the return ... to the
roots of Cirque du Soleil”. David
Shiner, the director, describes it as “a
show ... devoted to the ‘spirit’ of the
clown”.
As such, the show contains all of
the circus staples: high wire, swinging
trapeze, unicycles and people
standing on other people (standing
on a third person). It also features
no less than three clowns, and a full
body puppet dog that caused no end
of laughter from the various school
groups in attendance.
The storyline follows a central
character, Innocent, as he discovers
the mysterious world of Kooza.
Played by Stéphan Landry, he is led
into a mysterious world of acrobats
and wonder, controlled by the
mysterious Trickster. In the second
act, entrusted with the power to
control the world, he discovers a
more sinister and unsettling world
altogether. But there is beauty here
too, and during the second act, he is
appointed King of the realm by one
of the clowns.
Landry gives an excellent
performance, and acts as the
audience’s perspective on the show.
His status as a clear Mary Sue is a
device also used in Cirque’s feature
length retrospective, Worlds Away,
but it is not tired here.
The three clowns pervade the
performance, and are in general
very loud and slightly irritating:
a quality that good clowns should
aim for. Despite being stymied by
a sound operator who could have
been watching far more closely, they
pulled off some excellent audience
interaction, especially during the
second half and their dance break
with ‘some guy called Chris’.
However, the standout
performance came from Barry
Nathan Lowin as the Trickster, the
ruler and controller of the world
of Kooza. Effortlessly poised, and
possessed of an unsettling ability to
flip upside down without warning,
he has been with the production
since its inception in 2008. It is
perhaps reasonable that he’s got
his act down flat, but from his
emergence from a jack in the box
at the beginning to the ceremonial
closing of the curtains in the finale,
he is a pleasure to watch.
Lowin also proves himself as a
performer in his own right as the
Skeleton King in the second act.
It is rare to find such a talented
dancer in the circus community,
and Clarence Ford’s 40s and 50s
inspired choreography give him the
chance to show up his compatriots in
appropriate style.
Kooza, quite sensibly, uses the
tradition of making sure that the
‘most stupid’ things to do happen at
the beginnings and ends of acts. The
beginning and end of the show are
performed mostly by a single group
of acrobats – the Charivari. Three-
high shoulder stands and an early
man-supported trampoline establish
the show as classic circus.
To end the first half, we are treated
to a circus staple – the high wire act,
in this case involving 4 acrobats.
Starting fairly lightly, with some
fake fencing, runs and skipping(!)
on the high wire, the act culminates
in one acrobat, standing on a chair,
on a pole, on two more acrobats
riding bikes. On a high wire. It was
unfortunate that the apparatus took
so long to set up, though, and the
use of a confetti cannon on various
sections of the stalls didn’t do much
to pass the time.
The Wheel of Death, the first
acrobatics of Act 2, also disappointed
me slightly. Having seen what is
possible on the apparatus in the
recording of Worlds Away – it’s on
the US Netflix, I highly recommend
having a look – it was a shame not
to see any somersaults outside of
the wheels. The performance, by
its very nature, also lacked a strong
character, and unfortunately it felt
rather too much like an exhibition
and not enough like a masterclass.
Other weaker performances were
the contortion, unicycle and hoop
acts. I am increasingly convinced
that all hoop artists look almost
exactly the same, and despite the
circus adage of “those in the first
few rows, may get wet”, I do feel that
many within the auditorium might
have wanted to see the sweat – or at
least the performer’s faces.
I did, though, highly enjoy the
swinging trapeze and hand-on-hand
acts – and not just because they’re
styles I love to watch in any forum.
The acts were seamless, and the
emotional love story in the hand-on-
hand was truly excellent.
The Charivari return at the end to
perform a teeterboard act. For those
of you who don’t know, this consists
"The range
of acts is
huge, and
there is
something
for
everyone"
"It is rare to
find such
a talented
dancer in
the circus
community"
of something that looks very like a
children’s see-saw. An acrobat places
themselves at one end, and then
two to four more jump on to the
other end. The flyer is catapulted
5-6 metres into the air, and flips
occur. Occasionally the acrobat being
thrown starts on one or two stilts.
One of my favourite aspects
of the production was in the
non-traditional treatment of the
ringmaster. The show is started
by one of the clowns, a ridiculous
creature, before being superseded
by the enigmatic Trickster. In a rare
twist however, Innocent makes most
of the decisions in the second half;
indeed, by the finale the show is
placed firmly into the hands of the
audience.
The range of acts is huge, and there
is something for everyone in the
show, completing Shiner’s aims of
“[revealing] the interior life af the
clown… his hope, innocence, fear,
solitude, joy, and above all his love”.
Kooza is emphatically a Western
production. Despite visually
engrossing costumes and set,
implementing Indian and Eastern
European influences, the style,
character, and indeed language
are agressively North American
– specifically, Canadian. It leaves
behind abstraction to return to the
fun-loving circus of Cirque’s early
days, and is well worth the price of a
ticket.
