This week, The Times reported that
The Sun had dropped their Page 3
feature. Following the writing of this
article, the naked ladies were reinstated
on Thursday.
The Sun dropped its Page 3
feature this week, ending a
40 year tradition of featuring
young, beautiful women on their
third page, mostly topless and
with suggestive headers or sidebars
with “The News in Briefs”. The
change comes following a 28 month
campaign by No More Page 3, lead
by Lucy-Anne Holmes. The No More
Page 3 website states, “This is not
about censorship, or passing an Act of
Parliament to force Dominic Mohan,
the editor of The Sun, to scrap Page
Three. We are asking him – politely –
to remove it voluntarily.”
This week they succeeded in their
aim, but the response hasn’t been
totally supportive. Some women
have accused the movement of being
anti-sex-worker, of being prudish,
and of opposing the free press. Past
campaigns to remove the pictures
have led to women being branded
“fat and jealous”, and as “battleaxe(s)”
by the newspaper itself, which
has maintained silence over the
surprising decision not to feature the
pictures since last Friday. Why the
feature was removed from print is
still a mystery, but since new topless
photos are available on the Sun
website daily, something tells me it
wasn’t a sudden feminist epiphany.
Personally, I think the removal of
Page 3 is just a small step towards a
fairer representation of women in
the media. Whilst I am in favour
of the freedom of women to utilise
their bodies in any way they would
like without reproach, from glamour
modelling to serving in the army, I
believe that while the British media
continue to underrepresent the words
and actions of women in the news,
and focus instead on looks and boobs,
they are still upholding sexism and
inequality in our society.
In a 2012 study on women in
journalism, it was found that 84% of
people mentioned or quoted in front
page articles were men. Only 24% of
journalists at daily newspapers are
women and male experts who were
quoted or interviewed in science
pieces outnumbered women 4 to 1.
Women will have fewer mentions in
political and scientific news, because
of the dearth of women in these
fields, but the refusal of national news
to acknowledge the opinions and
actions of half the population leads in
turn to the view that women do not
belong in these spheres.
No More Page 3 has got into trouble
with some critics due to members
of the campaign shaming the Page
3 models, and extending this shame
to all female sex workers. It is this
side of the campaign which lead
many members of Imperial Feminist
Society, including myself, to decide
against supporting the campaign,
because we believe that sex workers
deserve the same respect as any
women, and that the Page 3 models
are not the people acting in ways that
we should be campaigning against.

titillation, but with the backdrop of
the continuing absence of women’s
voices in British news it takes on a
more serious role.
If we can work towards a more
equal media representation then by
all means plaster erogenous zones (of
all genders!) all over your tabloids.
Until then Page 3, scantily clad celebs
in “candid” photographs and the lack
of women’s voices in the daily news
all simply seek to reinforce the idea
that women have no more to offer
than their looks, and that is what we
should really be campaigning against.
This goes out to all the bad
people. This is for the
terrorists and the murderers;
for those who are violent and
bigoted, or ignorant and entitled;
for the unscrupulous businessmen
and the hypocritical prigs; for the
unrepentant criminals and the self-
righteous moralisers. To you, I want
to say thank you.
You bad people make my life
so much easier. You see, I’m not a
good person by any stretch of the
imagination. I’m lazy, self-centred,
pretty arrogant and spoiled. I’ve been
known to not recycle, and I demand
of others more than I ask of myself.
I’ve never volunteered, I barely ever
donate to charity, I struggle to eat my
five-a-day and I once killed a puppy.
I lie a lot and spend too much time
playing video games. But, I’m not a
bad person. Not while people who are
worse than me exist.
It’s really, really easy to destroy any
feeling of self-improvement when I
compare myself to you, bad people.
I may not spare two thoughts for
impoverished girls in Africa, but at
least I didn’t kidnap them and force
them to marry me. I may have vague
and ill-informed opinions about
society and gender roles, but I have
never harassed someone over the
internet in the name of abolishing
the patriarchy or defending ethics in
game journalism.
When I look at my failures and
my faults, they all seem small and
insignificant when measured against
the enormities that other people
commit. It becomes clear to me that
even if I did try to improve myself,
I’m still better than many others
through inaction. By simply minding
my business, I do not harm other
people, which is more than can be said
for those who are bad. Sure, I don’t
help other people either, but indolent
passivity seems like an acceptable
second to being a good person.
Besides, the modern age has made

it all the easier to be good. Donating
to most charities takes a few clicks
at most, and simply hashtagging the
buzzword of the week shows that I
care. If I’m feeling extra-helpful, I
could even change my profile pic on
Facebook to something like ‘Je suis
Charlie’ or whatever will be the next
catchphrase in order to “increase
awareness” and “show solidarity”.
I mean, I haven’t done any of those
things, but it’s good to know that
there’s always the option in case I
need it.
In a better society, I would be a bad
person. I would feel forced to improve
myself, to sacrifice something to
help others, to stop wasting time and
money for selfish reasons, to try to be
something more than I am right now.
But that would take effort. So I’m
glad I live in this society, where I can
justify my flaws by saying, ‘at least
I’m not as bad as those guys’.
And for this, I have to thank you,
bad people.
Should we celebrate the
loss of Page 3?
