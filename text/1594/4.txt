Former cabinet minister
and current MP for Sutton
Coldfield, Andrew Mitchell
spoke to students this week about
the importance of aid and charity in
improving the lives of people in the
developing world.
In front of large audience in
Blackett Lecture Theatre 1, Mitchell
– perhaps best known to readers
for his involvement in the so-called
“plebgate” scandal – spoke about
his two years as International
Development Secretary.
Tuesday’s event, organised by
Imperial Raising and Giving (RAG),
covered a wide range of topics, from
the importance of educating women
in overcoming the hardships faced by
those communities living in extreme
poverty.
What Britain excels at, Mitchell
said, is using development funding to
generate lasting social and political
solutions: training teachers and
doctors, not just building schools and
hospitals. Mitchell was also keen to
emphasise the benefits that foreign
aid spending can bring to the UK:
helping British business and reducing
the risk of conflict and terrorism.
Turning to his record in
government, Mitchell said he is
proud of pushing through the Bribery
act that prevents companies engaging
in corrupt practices abroad that they
would never consider doing in the
UK.
He was also keen to stress the
decisions made at DfID to ensure
efficiencies and value for money
for the taxpayer, often, for instance,
paying charities and NGOs to carry
out operations, rather than using an
already overstretched military.
Mitchell also defended the UK’s
historic aid to India. Although
this funding is now being wound
down, the government has been
criticised for still providing aid to a
country, which now has its own space
programme.
In response, he pointed out the
levels of poverty that still exist there,
and that the space programme is
privately funded, and will aid India’s
development through improved
communications across the vast
country.
Mitchell was also keen to
encourage students to get involved
in international development, and
offered advice to those considering a
career in the sector.
When asked how he would respond
to those critical of funding projects
overseas in a time of difficulties in
the UK, he replied: “charity begins at
home, but it doesn’t end there.”
Mr Mitchell has had a varied
career including spells as an army
officer and an investment banker
before first entering parliament in
1987, before eventually rising to the
position of Conservative chief whip.
RAG chair Ben Fernando said:
”I'm really glad Mr Mitchell could
come along and engage in a really
interesting discussion with us about
International Development.
It was also good to see how many
passionate people there are at
Imperial on this subject.”

Another broken coach
window and a suspension
for the ICSM Boat Club
Another sports club tour has
resulted in a broken coach
window, with the club now
currently suspended as a result.
The incident happened on the
mixed Medics Boat Club tour to
Leuven, Belgium, last weekend, as
the coach was waiting at Dover to
board the ferry. The coach was not
in motion, and as we understand no
students were hurt.
The low quality CCTV shows a
member of the party falling against
a window, and they either broke the
window as they fell or they may have
used an emergency hammer. It is
believed that the person responsible
is a qualified doctor.
Felix understands that the coach
also required valeting as, allegedly, 25
bottles of port were recovered from
the floor of the vehicle, eight seats
were covered with vomit and three
condoms were found down the side of
some of the seats.
Sources also have said that during
the journey many students were
out of their seats, which may have
increased the risk of a student falling
against a window in the first place.
Felix has also been told that the
total damages amount to £3,075,
which the company are currently
pursuing through Imperial College
Union. This includes the cost to
repair the window, valet the coaches
and also the loss of earnings after
having to take the coaches off the
road to be cleaned properly.
The club were suspended on
Monday (yesterday), and were told
in a club email that they are banned
from any sort of training and
social activities until “they are told
otherwise.” They have been advised
to not wear any kit with their logos or
branding on them, and refrain from
posting on social media in regards
to the tour. They have also been told
not to “discuss what happened with
anyone not involved.”
Another email, sent to the mailing
list shortly after, advised students not
to attend a suggested party after the
tour, and also thanked students who
helped to clean up the coaches after
the journey.
This year’s tour to Leuven, Belgium,
known as the 10+1 Tour since it is now
in its eleventh year, was organised last
term, and both students and doctors
who had recently graduated were in
attendance. The tour consisted of 100
students, spread across two coaches,
and each coach ticket cost £55 per
student, with the club paying £5,250
in total to book the coaches and the
ferry trip.
The students left Hammersmith at
11pm Friday night en route to Dover
to catch a ferry. However the coach
company had to send another vehicle
to Dover at about 2am to take the
stranded students to Leuven, after
their previous vehicle was rendered
unsafe due to the broken window.
They arrived in Leuven around
1pm on Saturday, remained

overnight in a hotel then returned
Sunday evening. The coach arrived
back in Hammersmith at 9.15 pm.
The coach company had previously
told the students it was permitted to
drink on the vehicle.
Tom Wheeler, Imperial College
Union President, when asked for a
statement on the matter, told Felix:
“During a 48-hour Medics Boat Club
Tour to Belgium, damage was caused
to the rear window of a Coach. The
damage was caused by an alumnus
of the College. It is believed that the
window became damaged following
contact with the member’s body. The
Club has been suspended pending a
Union investigation.”
Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, the
President of Imperial College School
of Medicine, told Felix: “The incident
that occurred recently is not being
taken lightly by ICSMSU. We are
currently investigating the incident
in order to get a full picture. ICSMSU
Boat have been co-operating fully
since the incident was reported.”
The club declined to comment on
the incident.
This comes only months after
the Imperial Medicals Rugby team
smashed a coach window last term
whilst on tour too, that time to
Bristol. The team was also suspended
as a result.
