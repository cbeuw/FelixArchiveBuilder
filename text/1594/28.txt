Max Falkenberg interviews Vampire Diaries’ Michael Malarkey, as he releases his debut EP
Interview with a vampire
Ma: What's the experience been
like on the set of The Vampire
Diaries?
Mi: It’s a charming and passionate
group of people who all look out for
each other. It’s a beautiful thing when
you get to work with that sense of
camaraderie and it allows you to relax
into the work with abandon. We film
in Atlanta, Georgia as well (our home
away from home) and I’ve come to
really love the vibe down there.
Ma: What influenced the decision
to change to music from acting?
Mi: I am by no means changing
horses midstream. Music is what I
have always done in my downtime,
even before I was an actor. They are
two different forms of expression and
I feel like I am at the point in my life
where I feel I am creatively able to
juggle both.
It’s not a crossroads, more a
merging of lanes!
Ma: What process do you go
through to write your music?
Mi: When the spark isn’t there I
don’t force it. I have to be in a certain
mood. Coffee helps.
Ma: What made you take the
decision to move to London from
the states?
Mi: I had to relocate for The
Vampire Diaries. I’ll be back…
Ma: Do you have any big plans
for the future? Where can our
readers find your work?
Mi: I am currently planning to
get into the studio as soon as I can
to record some more music and we
are currently still filming Season 6
of The Vampire Diaries. My EP ‘Feed
The Flames’ is out now and you can
download it on all media outlets.
You can catch The Vampire Diaries
here on itv2 on Tuesdays at 9pm.

Tucked just off Cable Street, a
short walk from the hustle and
bustle of Aldgate, Wilton’s
Music Hall is one of the hidden treas-
ures of London’s East End. Positively
steeped in history and tradition, it is
one of the capital’s oldest music halls,
and one of the very few surviving
ones that retains its original features.
With such an illustrious legacy, it is
understandable that some musicians
may feel nervous when they emerge
onto the stage.
However, last week saw the London
debut of a performer who is no
stranger to treading the boards, and
commanded the audience with poise
and grace.
Michael Malarkey may be best
known for playing the role of Enzo,
the handsome anti-hero of the
American drama series The Vampire
Diaries, but has actually been writing
music for the best part of a decade.
While this combination of music and
drama may sound strange, Malarkey
is part of a rich tradition of actor-
musicians; after all, what would Kylie
Minogue be without Neighbours,
Drake without Degrassi? We had a
quick chat with Michael, who made
an appearance at Wilton’s last week,
following the release of his EP ‘Feed
The Flames’ late last year:
Max: When did you start making
music?
Michael: I started off playing in
punk and hardcore bands just after
high school in Ohio. I didn’t play
any instruments; I was the singer –
although I was screaming most of the
time. I began teaching myself how to
play guitar around this time and have
been writing my own songs ever since.
Ma: Is there anybody in
particular you have taken
inspiration from for your music /
acting?
Mi: My holy trinity, if you will, of
musicians is Tom Waits, Nick Cave
and Leonard Cohen, though Tom
Waits is the main reason I wanted
to start writing my own songs. It
literally blew my mind when I first
heard ‘Rain Dogs’.
As far as acting inspiration goes,
I’ve had the pleasure of working
with a wealth of incredible actors,
directors and mentors over the years
and it’s fair to say that they have all
influenced me in different ways. I
feel like I learn from everyone I work
with, whether I know it or not...
