We are not standing up for free speech
The Comment section of
last week’s Felix made
for interesting reading,
unsurprisingly, the writers for the
most part choosing to focus on the
Charlie Hebdo massacre, which has
been dominating headlines these
past weeks. I’ll start by saying that
there were good ideas expressed in
those articles, and in the centre-left’s
media response as a whole, however,
I believe that Felix and the rest of the
mainstream media is wrong not to
stand up for freedom of expression
and publish the cartoons.
Firstly, there’s no question that
Charlie Hebdo is a crass and offensive
publication – albeit that particularly
delightful brand of crass and
offensive, reminiscent of South Park,
which achieves impartiality through
indiscriminate lampooning. They
shine a light on hypocrisy, whether
it can be found in synagogues (they
were ferociously critical of Israel’s
bombing of Gaza), churches or
mosques. They have also always been
extremely disparaging of the far right
bigotry which many seem quick to
assume they represent, few having
taken the time to look at anything
other than their cartoons of Muslims.
A quick perusal of their past
publications is enough to reveal that
the magazine – whilst undeniably
unsubtle – is satirical, as well as
morally sophisticated and consistent,
meaning that obtuse comparisons
of the cartoons to Nazi propaganda
are neither apt nor helpful. I’m not
here primarily to defend Charlie
Hebdo, however I think that the
interpretation of the ‘Je suis Charlie’
campaign as agreement with
anything in particular published
by the magazine would be a
misunderstanding.
I feel that the mistakes that liberal
journalists and intellectuals have
made can often be traced back to
good intentions – they are wary of
criticising the beliefs of minorities
for fear of inciting or contributing to
persecution, and are very conscious
of the historical (and contemporary)
oppression of foreign peoples by
Western powers. This attitude
becomes dangerous when it stifles
criticism of virulent ideologies
through reflexively and uncritically
defending any position, simply by
virtue of the fact that it is held by a
minority. Basically, the existence of
persecution against Muslims doesn’t
mean that Muslim ideologies and
sensibilities need defending at every
turn.
Charlie Hebdo satirises anyone and
everyone, and I think that it’s plain
to see that the groups which show the
greatest resistance to that practice,
even going so far as to threaten and
exact violent retribution, are those
most in need of it. Not only because
their sensitivity is usually a product
of the weakness of their position, but
because if men with guns tell us not
to do something perfectly harmless
and we comply – even though it’s
clearly the safest and easiest option,
and many of us may not even have
thought to perform the offensive
action in the first place – we have
capitulated.
They go away (for now) secure in
the knowledge that violence has
once again trumped peaceful debate.
Others watch, and eagerly load their
weapons. The cartoons may not mean
much by themselves, we may even
find them distasteful and crude, but
demonstrating to the world that the
western media can be silenced with
such threats weakens our credibility
when it comes to criticising extremist
Muslim ideology on other topics –
homophobia, misogyny and sectarian
conflict to name a few – of far
greater importance. It is important
to try to get along with people and
embrace their ideas, but some ideas
are genuinely terrible and need to be
criticised, whether in cartoon form or
any other, and doing so isn’t bigotry.
I am sure that many will object to
my assertion that publishing these
cartoons is ‘perfectly harmless’.
Of course they don’t exactly fly
in the face of visual stereotypes,
and it would be something of an
understatement to say Muslims
have objected to them on religious
grounds. But the truth is it isn’t
reasonable to be offended by satire
to this extent. Relative to the violent
response amongst extremist Muslims
to offences of this kind – and the
‘deafening silence’ in the wake of
that violence we see all too often in
moderates – the drawing of satirical
doodles is completely harmless, and
asserting anything else is lunacy.
It doesn’t make ethical sense to
complain that a murder victim was
‘needlessly offensive’ for insulting
their attacker’s haircut, and doing so
would veer dangerously close to an
attempt to justify the crime. And yet
we see this being argued all too often,
in the Felix last week as well as in the
liberal media as a whole.
Those moderate Muslims who
share our desire for freedom should
understand why we have to make this
statement and print these cartoons,
and that we mean no particular
offence to them in doing so. I would
say the same thing to moderate Jews
or Christians if terrorists of their
faith were willing to kill journalists in
the name of censorship.
In the long run, if we don’t stand
up for the ideals that our society has
strived to institutionalise over the
past centuries then we risk losing
them. And if we don’t defend them in
print or by other peaceful means then
we allow it to get to the stage where we
must do so with police snipers, as was
the case in France. So that’s why Felix,
and every media publication with any
respect for the enlightenment values
so central to our society, should have
published those cartoons.
