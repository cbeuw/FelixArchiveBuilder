The rise of Imperial Facebook
pages spans several years, but
despite sprouting a number of
different pages they are all for pretty
much of the same audience. These in-
clude such as Imperial College Secrets,
Spotted: Central Library and Humans
of Imperial, some of which allow stu-
dents to anonymously submit content
to be posted on the page, with others
having admins that track down and
curate content themselves.
The first page to gain serious
traction was Imperial Memes back
in 2012, with posts accumulating
up to 200 likes apiece and students
commenting and submitting
constantly. The page became inactive
when the moderator graduated the
following year, although by then
more pages were springing up and
attracting thousands of likes by
students across campuses and year
groups.
The pages’ popularities seem to
coincide with holidays or revision
periods, and understandably so.
Imperial College Secrets, which
began in September 2013, has only
recently exploded as the Christmas
holidays came to an end, with posts
dramatically increasing in frequency
on the page and the number of likes
increasing by a few thousand in a
matter of weeks.
The obvious draw of these pages are
the sense of community they provide:
Imperial College Secrets in particular
has attracted a lot of students posting
about mental health difficulties, with
other students posting comments of
support.
Slightly more bizarre was also the
attempt to organise some sort of
orgy for students complaining about
sexual frustration, but generally
the posts have been sincere, if not
saddening to hear about students
struggling with various issues.
Other posts have not been so
savoury or positive: one included a
link to a photo of someone’s faecal
matter in a sink, which was viewed
hundreds of times. Another post is
about medical student who admits to
sleeping with a consultant, with many
more posters admitting to drug use,
illicit sex, hatred for room/hall mates,
and a general apathy for Imperial as a
University.
A shocking number seem keen to
discuss ejaculate, whether it is in food,
shampoo bottles or a jar kept on the
window shelf.
It is easy to underestimate the
number of students that are actively
interacting with the page; despite
many posts on Imperial College
Secrets attracting tens of likes, some
of the polls posted, such as “Which
Biology lecturer would you sleep
with?” have seen over two hundred
votes (Tim Simpson was the winner of
that, by the way).
These admins can also be held as
liable for the content posted online,
as propagating lies or slander to an
audience is considered defamatory
and can even be sued as a result.
Even if the admin doesn’t write the
defamatory comment, the fact that
they republished the material to an
audience, regardless in size, leaves
them liable under the Defamatory
Act 2013.
Felix investigated exactly what
College could do about these pages
should they become unsavoury.
A spokesperson said that users
of College’s IT facilities must not
“display, store, receive or transmit
images or text which could be
considered offensive e.g. material of
a sexual, pornographic, paedophilic,
sexist, racist, libellous, threatening,
defamatory, of a terrorist nature
or likely to bring the College into
disrepute.”
They continued: “Where
appropriate, the College will
investigate and may take action
under its procedure for dealing with
student disciplinary offences.”
They also told us that written
consent should be sought from
College to use “Imperial College,”
either alone or as part of a longer
name. This also extends to the crest,
and applies to both commercial uses
of both of these elements and social
purposes too.
“It is the responsibility of all
members of the College to ensure that
publications and communications
bearing the name Imperial College
London should not contain material
that is inaccurate or detrimental to
the good reputation of the College.”
Such pages are not unique to
Imperial, and in fact, some aren’t
even run by Imperial students. The
page Things Imperial Students Don’t
Say is ran by the Tab HQ, the national
student tabloid group, alongside
Imperial Facebook pages: the good,
the bad, and the downright hilarious
PHILIPPA SKETT
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
many other “Things students don’t
say” pages for other Universities.
Some have also attracted a lot of
bad press in the past, especially those
that became popular nationwide.
Laura Bates, the founder of the
EverydaySexism project in the
Guardian last year, called out the
“Spotted” pages, which were very
popular with Universities nationwide.
These pages often contained posts
from students about others, they had
“spotted” in the library, although
many people were photographed
without permission and then posted
on the page for thousands to see.
Bates said the pages were
demonstrative of “Objectification,
harassment and misogyny.” She
outlined how female students felt
awkward or nervous going to places
which had these pages associated with
them.
Rate Your Shag pages also attracted
the attention of the national media in
2013 after Facebook removed them
because of naming students in full.
Loughborough University warned
students that they would be kicked
off their course if they were found to
be posting on the pages.
The pages aren’t limited to
Facebook either: there has been
several Twitter pages of the same
nature, although it seems students
aren’t ready to move to Twitter just
yet. The anonymous twitter account
Imperial Gossip Girl (@ICGossipGal)
has currently 54 followers, and has
only tweeted 23 times.
No doubt more pages will spring up
in the future, probably in conjunction
with the exam season, although for
the time being it seems that the
niche is pretty saturated with pages
addressing pretty much all aspects of
a student’s life at Imperial.
That’s not to say the majority of the
posts on the Imperial Facebook pages
aren’t funny or entertaining. Many
of the posts on Imperial pages seem
to capture the ethos of the university
very well and make for a great
procrastination tool, if nothing else.
If you ever wanted to scroll endlessly
through snippets into the lives of
Imperial student, these pages are
probably the best place to start.
