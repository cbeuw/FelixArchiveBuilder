Brooklyn Nine-Nine: For Your Consideration
Sitcoms are notoriously hard to
get right; and cop genre comedies
especially so. TV history is full
of huge success stories and miserable
failures. For every triumphant series
there are four or five flops, many
of which never even make it to the
pilot stage. But despite the significant
challenges involved in creating
a popular situational comedy,
the occasional show is destined
to succeed. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is
one such success story. Created by
Michael Schur and Daniel J. Goor,
Brooklyn Nine-Nine is arguably 2014’s
best new comedy series and has only
just premiered in the UK.
The single-camera series follows
a team of detectives and a newly
appointed captain in the fictional 99th
Precinct of the New York City Police
Department in Brooklyn. Captain
Ray Holt (Andre Braugher) takes
over the precinct, which includes
Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), a gifted
but childish detective whose non-
conformist practices inexorably
become questioned by his new
Commanding Officer. The main cast
includes Detective Amy Santiago
(Melissa Fumero), Jake’s driven and
diligent partner; Detective Charles
Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), Jake’s people-
pleasing and hardworking friend;
Detective Sergeant Terry Jeffords
(Terry Crews), a keen bodybuilder
who recently left field work after
the birth of his baby girls; Detective
Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), a
rugged and mysterious coworker;
and Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti),
the precinct’s cynical yet perceptive
administrator.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine packs in the
jokes, ranging from very smart
to very stupid. The series seems
refreshingly playful and there

is a noticeable effort to get in a
substantial amount of character
development for by sitcom
standards. For instance, Captain
Ray Holt is one of the most nuanced
and multidimensional gay men
I’ve ever seen on television. Holt
suffered in the NYPD and despite
many years of outstanding service
to the department, has only just
been promoted to the position of
Commanding Officer. He ascribes
this to prejudice against his
homosexuality and created a group
that supported gay African-American
NYPD members to address the
problem. The Captain himself shows
little in the way of outward emotion
(something which the cast regularly
refer to) but proves to be an attentive
and considerate boss who cares deeply
for his team.
Despite the core power struggle
between Holt and Peralta, Brooklyn
Nine-Nine is very much an ensemble
series. In shows of this kind, it is often
the case that the group will feature
one or two characters that aren’t quite
as funny or developed as the others.
However, each actor seems perfectly
cast for the part and they all get a
share of the big laughs.
The series employs flashbacks
that make for interesting pacing
and character advancement. If
the dialogue contains some highly
convenient piece of information,
you can bet someone will point out
that it was far too convenient. Yes it’s
American and yes it’s a little corny
at times, but far less cheesy than
the likes of The Big Bang Theory or
some other cringe-inducing sitcom.
To be clear, I admire the writing of
The Big Bang Theory, but somehow I
can’t stand watching it. I’ve probably
polarised the audience there. Okay,
I (don’t really mind/honestly loathe)
The Big Bang Theory. Delete according
to your prejudices. Happy now?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine grows on
you like any effective sitcom until
you crave the sense of warmth and
familiarity that the characters give
you. It is this emotional investment
in the characters that makes a
popular sitcom look like gold dust to a
television network. An added benefit
to well defined characters is that the
plot can occasionally be less engaging
in and of itself and the quality
won’t suffer. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is
an example of one such series and
the quality over the first 22 twenty-
minute episodes only improved as it
went on.
It goes for more enlightened jokes
and often deals with topics such
as race, gender and sexuality in an
intelligent manor. All this, combined
with the motley crew of personalities
and the peculiar scenarios they
are put in, makes for high quality
amusement that warms the cockles
of our cold, cold hearts. If you are
looking for an entertaining and
uplifting sitcom to watch during a
break from revision or just to relax,
then Brooklyn Nine-Nine might just be
for you.
The first series is now on Netflix and
the show premiered in the UK on E4
January 15th.
