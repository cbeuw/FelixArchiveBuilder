London’s Best Small Theatres - Part 1
Max Falkenburg kicks off our guide to overlooked city venues
The Finborough Theatre
If every small theatre were like
the Finborough I’d probably
never have any complaints.
Punching well above its weight,
the Finborough has long been
regarded as one of the absolute
best fringe venues in London for a
number of years.A small theatre
which uniquely hosts a number
of well-known actors and writers,
the Finborough’s creative vision is
unique in that they pursue a policy
of never performing a play which
has been shown in London in the
last 20 years.Whether that is new
writing or unloved masterpieces,the
Finborough is known throughout
the theatre community as a sure-fire
bet for a good show.Completely
unsubsidised,few other theatres
need your support as much as the
Finborough.

As much as I hate musical theatre,
this may genuinely be a show to
look out for.The European premiere
of a multi Tony award nominated
musical,the re ispotential to
completely immerse the audience
with its deeply unsettling story set in
Nazi occupied France.

Wilton’s Music Hall
Although once a mainstay of
London life,the music hall has
dissapeared from our streets;
luckily for Wilton’s,the historical
value of such venues has been
recognised,and the hall is now
Grade II*listed,protected from
demolition.Others have not been
so lucky
Currently under restoration,
although not closed,the hall plays
host to a number of productions,
including opera,music,cabaret,
and dance. Its location is also
unique: just off Cable Street,the
hall is at the junction between the
city and the East End,an area that
has been dynamically changing for
years,and is now rapidly gentrifying.
With many original features still
remaining,Wilton’s Music Hall is a
one-of-a-kind venue,and certainly
worth checking out for anyone
interested in culture,architecture,
and even the history of the city we
all live in.

A Rococo romp through Marylebone
in the mid-18th Century,this
production should serve as a
perfect introduction to the world of
theatre and opera for those who are
intimidated by their reputations.

Theatre 503
As their website likes to remind us,
Theatre 503 is“arguably the most
important theatre in Britain today”.
Known for their support of new and
exciting playwrights,the theatre
–an offshoot of the superb Gate
Theatre in Notting Hill–offers more
new writing opportunities than
any other theatre in the country,
cementing its reputation as one of
London’s leading small theatres.
Winner of a number of awards and
nominated for countless others,
this charming small theatre makes
the most of its humble space.With
only around a hundred seats,the
503 offers an intimacy which many
larger theatres can only dream
of.(the seats are exceptionally
uncomfortable,but that’s hardly the
point.)Theatre 503 really is a special
venue,since it offers so many shows
which wouldn’t/couldn’t appear
anywhere else.But,as is always the
risk with new writing,sometimes
what you see is a complete travesty…

Set in the run-up to Ireland’s
historical divorce referendum
of 1995,this play explores the
mechanics and intimacies of a
breakdown of a family in crisis;
within a domestic setting,dark
truths are brought to light and
expunged in this dramatic tale.

Playhouse
Southwark Playhouse
Southwark Playhouse is alive.With
the look and feel of an Edinburgh
Fringe venue,this theatre is one of
the most vibrant and interesting
spaces south of the river.Built into
the railway arches just along from
Elephant & Castle,Southwark
Playhouse is on the larger side of
the small theatres in this series
while still using every inch of space
available.The auditorium is filled
to the brim with seats and the set is
only a metre or so from the back of
the room.While I imagine the layout
feeling somewhat ominous when
the house is not full,when sold out
the theatre has a buzz that I can’t say
I’ve felt in a London venue in many
years.
With a pretty chilled bar (if a little
on the expensive side),and what
feels like a devoted,regular crowd,
Southwark Playhouse offers
the chance to see young,edgier
productions,while still retaining a
sterling reputation.
