It seems a safe bet that never
before in the history of the
Royal Academy of Arts has the
Tennant Gallery been adorned
with either a bowl of glass eyes or
a mannequin that can lay claim to
having posed as the Queen for a world
famous portrait. Black and White
Gothic offers both of these and more.
Pairing personal artefacts with pieces
both polished and in progress, this
exhibition provides a rare glimpse of
not only of the works of a first rate,
yet little known artist, but also an
opportunity to examine something of
both the process of their creation and
the character of their creator. Despite
the fact that more than two thirds of
the members of the Royal Academy
have worked as illustrators in the
past, this art form has remained
unfairly neglected. This one room
showcase focuses largely on Stewart’s
illustrations for an edition of Joseph
Sheridan Le Fanu’s 1864 novel Uncle
Silas; a series of darkly evocative stills
brimming with barely contained
motion, it is well worth a visit for
anyone with an interest in the gothic
or in illustration and its influence on
modern cinematography.
Charles Stewart was born in 1915 on
the island of Panay in the Philippines.
Due to poor health and questionable
logic on the part of his parents, he
was shipped off to the ‘restorative’
climes of Scotland as an infant. The
influence of Shambellie House,
the family’s baronial estate near
Dumfries is unmistakable throughout
his work. A turreted, gothic house
“lit by oil lamps and candles… [that]
to a small child… seemed a giant’s
castle… [in which] ghosts were
largely taken for granted by the
inhabitants”, Stewart’s formative
years were heavily influenced by his
physical environment. A series of
beautiful, though haunted landscapes
provided a dark frame for his
developing artistic vision. As an air
raid warden in London during World
War II Stewart endured a world of
terror and darkness on a day-to-
day basis. These experiences lend
his work a power that elevates his
illustrations from purely decorative
addenda to the novel’s text into the
realm of independently gripping
works as atmospheric as any of the
accompanying prose.
Described by a colleague as a
“neat, rounded man with a gentle
pink face and snow white hair”
who was often to be spotted dressed
in tweeds lunching at the Royal
Overseas League in nearby St
James’, he approached his work in
a scholarly fashion. Meticulous
research of Victorian costume
and artwork was integrated with
a lifelong appreciation of both

cinema and the stage. A number
of visits to the set of a 1947 film
production of Uncle Silas were to
be highly influential upon Stewart’s
work, as his illustrations in turn
influenced the cinematographers.
The artist’s profound understanding
of movement on stage and its
depiction in still art stems from his
balletic training, undertaken while
simultaneously studying at the Byam
Shaw School of Drawing and Painting
in the 1930s. Learning quickly,
Stewart went on to perform with
the corps de ballet at Covent Garden
during the 1936-37 season under the
direction of Sir Thomas Beecham. It
is clear that he was in a particularly
advantageous position to marry still
art with that of the theatre. This
naturally led him into the company
of cinematographers, especially those
who shared his passion for tales of
gothic horror. This is reflected in the
wide range of media on display in
the exhibition, ranging from a scene
from the 1947 film, through many
of Stewart’s original drawings to a
1953 watercolour of a larch tree in
the grounds of Shambellie. The tree
immortalised in an instant, darkly
silhouetted against a bright winter
sky. Stewart feared in later life that
an increasingly competitive world
would induce the corralling of young
people’s interests into an overly
narrow focus in order to drive up
academic or professional standards.
The frontispiece for Uncle Silas
(1947) is convincing argument against
any such a shift in educational
practice. Whirling figures straining
with movement speak volumes of
the influence of his balletic training,
something he suspected that he would
not have been able to pursue had he
been born today into a more limiting
environment.
Today, many find themselves
alienated from fine art by the
perception of the culture that
surrounds its appreciation. The
stream of seemingly randomly
assigned symbolic meanings and
interpretations that bear little, if any
resemblance to the works on display
leaves many cold to the prospect of
giving galleries a chance. I would
like to think that Stewart would have
sympathised with this position. The
indifference of most art critics was
something he faced throughout his
career and was something that seems
to have left him largely unmoved.
Gothic art at its best speaks to us on
a visceral level, evoking the creeping
sensation present at the back of every
mind that all is not as it seems. Much
of his work is simple, but rather
than a weakness this represents its
greatest strength being indicative
of the universality and importance
of the themes he explores. There
are few works of art that manage to
engage with humanity’s universal
terror at its inescapable mortality
while concluding on a fundamentally
invigorating note. The fact that
Stewart has achieved this is as
impressive as it is important. In 1976
Stewart gave Shambellie House to
the government, which was soon
reopened as the National Museum of
Costume. In 2013 it was announced
that the museum was to close despite
intense local opposition due to
financial pressures.
The underlying message of
Stewart’s work is simply too
important to be allowed to similarly
fade into oblivion. At times we are all
of us beset by horrors, but more often
than not the key to our salvation
lies in finding the strength within
ourselves to slay our demons, once
and for all.
