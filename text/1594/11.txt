Charlie Hebdo just isn’t funny enough
Let’s face it, 2014 was not a
great year. Tragedies ranging
from epidemics to political
tension to aviation mysteries to
religious extremism defined those
twelve depressing months. Even the
supposed sporting highlights were
overshadowed by allegations of greed
and corruption. At best, it was a 3/10.
Everyone is hoping that 2015 will
be different. Is a 6/10 too much to
ask? Only seven days in, however, the
dream suffered a huge body blow. The
Charlie Hebdo attack has been widely
covered and I’m sure you all know
what happened.
The mass shooting was as moronic
as it was despicable. To kill over a
cartoon is the kind of improbable
overreaction that you only see
in a cartoon. The attackers’ plan
was deeply flawed and the assault
on Charlie Hebdo’s head office,
considering their motivations, was
incredibly counterproductive.
I doubt that many Muslims have
ever read Charlie Hebdo. It was not a
hugely popular publication, with a
circulation of around 45,000 a week.
The left-wing magazine describes
itself as strongly anti-religion.
This makes the paper very easy for
Muslims to avoid. But after the attack
the paper became the most talked-
about publication in the world, and
the subsequent edition increased
its print run to 7 million in order to
meet demand, and it seems that an act
of savage terrorism has temporarily
saved the print industry.
Unsurprisingly, the Prophet
Mohammad made an appearance on
the front of the magazine. It is now
a lot harder for those who will be
offended by the publication to avoid
these cartoons, and support for the
satirical newspaper has increased
exponentially. This attempt to
suppress freedom of expression has
seriously backfired.
Like most people, I had never
heard of Charlie Hebdo before news
broke of the senseless killings, and
knew nothing of their controversial
depictions of the Prophet
Mohammad. After the unforgivable
shootings, I had a look at the
cartoons, and if I’m honest, I had a
problem with them: they just weren’t
that funny.
Charlie Hebdo’s portrayals of
Mohammad are cliché and stale, and
don’t even attempt to make any kind
of point about Islam. Any satirical
message is undercut by juvenile
humour, and this makes reasonable
followers of Islam less likely to
understand the majority of the West’s
peaceful position.
Most Brits want to coexist with the
Islamic world but these images will
not get us any closer to this ambition.
I whole-heartedly support Charlie
Hebdo’s right to publish the cartoons;
but that does not mean that I like
them.
Society functions best when citizens
can have reasonable debates about
their views, and challenge each
other’s opinion. One such vehicle
for this is satire, but it seems to me
that the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in
question barely qualify as satire. It’s
just a dumb picture of Mohammad
– a lazy caricature devoid of wit and
commentary. The correct response
to these cartoons is to voice your
opinion about them, or write a
column like I have here, not to shoot
the people responsible. People who
will kill others over a joke, no matter
how offensive, are sick in the head.
In order to prove the terrorists
have lost, we must go back to business
as usual. When I heard that Charlie
Hebdo was going to print the next
edition only days after the brutal
deaths of their colleagues I applauded
their courage and perseverance. The
‘Je suis Charlie’ demonstrations that
took place reassured me that people
are ready to protest against threats to
a free society. I just think it’s a shame
that the cartoons provoked a lot of
hatred without making many people
laugh, or even think.
Charlie Hebdo increased their print run dramatically in light of the attacks, but it's a shame
that it had to be over something so unfunny. Photo: The Independent
