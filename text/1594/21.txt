How to Train Your Dragon 2
You might have noticed there’s
been a bit of controversy about
the Oscars. The LEGO Movie
got completely snubbed for Best
Animated Feature, and a lot of people
got very angry, very, very quickly.
The directors (Phil Lord and Chris
Miller) responded in their typically
wonderful style, with the former
posting a picture of an Oscar statuette
made of LEGO, and the latter issuing
heart-felt thanks to all involved in the
film, as well as noting that “everything
[was] not awesome.”
But with the obvious outrage over
an animated snub aside (even though
it’s true, The LEGO Movie has been
pre-emptively robbed), there’s been
a more pressing and glaring issue, in
the complete overlooking of Selma
– or, for that matter, any actor or
actress of colour. Selma’s Best Picture
and Best Song nominations feel like a
token gesture – a vague gesture in the
direction of a film that has won near-
universal acclaim. Morten Tyldum
– the director of The Imitation Game,
a film that was good because of its
strong lead performance, not its weak
direction – was nominated over Ava
DuVernay, who produced something
truly incredible in Selma.
Elsewhere, there were some
genuinely valid nominations –
Michael Keaton’s turn in Birdman
is almost a dead cert, and rightly so,
while Wes Anderson finally gets a
nomination for his directing work
for The Grand Budapest Hotel, his
finest film to date. Rosamund Pike’s
performance in Gone Girl finally got
her the recognition she deserves,
while seeing J.K. Simmons nominated
for his appearance in Whiplash just
feels right.
Guardians of the Galaxy sneaks
in with two nominations – Visual
Effects and Make-Up & Hair, while
the film that it was hoped would
finally mark British director
Christopher Nolan’s embrace by the
Academy falls a little short, with
Interstellar only making appearances
in the technical categories, albeit
deservedly so.
It’s a mixed bag of nominations,
all in all. There are some very, very
right calls, and there are obvious
front-runners for the awards. But
there also some worrying omissions,
with the fact that the Academy is
predominantly old, male and white
being more obvious than it has in
years.
Felix Film’s Guide to Oscar betting
As the awards season builds up to its maximum climax that is the Oscars,
it becomes increasingly easier to predict the winner. And so here are
some of the predictions in the popoular categories. Bet at your own risk.
Best Picture: As shown in the poster above, the clear frontrunner here is
Boyhood, a film of remarkable achievements that was made over the period of
twelve years. The only real competitor this faces is Birdman, but given how Boy
has triumphed over Bird in pretty much all the important awards thus far, the
top prize of the night is likely to go in favour of what has been dubbed 12 Years
a Boy, taken after last year’s winning picture, 12 Years a Slave.
Best Actor in a Leading Role:
Michael Keaton, in his fantastic
return to form in Birdman is bound
to take home his first ever Oscar
of his career. He does face stiff
competition from audience-favourite
Eddie Redmayne of The Theory of
Everything, but the Brit actor is far too
young to be winning in this category.
Best Actress in a Leading Role:
Julianne Moore, believe it or not,
has never won an Oscar. She has
been nominated a bunch of times
and has sure been snubbed over the
years. 2015 will be her year, in her
heart-breakingly real portrait of an
early-onset Alzheimer’s patient, in
Still Alice.
Best Actor in a Supporting Role:
J. K. Simmons, who has long been
working as a character actor
appearing in bit parts, finally has
the chance to shine as a ruthless,
terrorising conductor of a jazz
band. His supporting performance
in Whiplash is winning all sorts of
accolades, and rightfully so.
Best Actress in a Supporting Role:
Patricia Arquette’s beautifully
nuanced performance, spanning a
period of over a decade, is a part of
what makes this ambitious tale of
Boyhood work so well. With a Golden
Globe already in the bag, an Oscar is
looking very much a likely scenario
for this underrated actress.
