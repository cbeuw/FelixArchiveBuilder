"The story
is more

way that
warfare
distorts
peoples'
childhoods"
"You feel
affronted
by the
intimacy
and
violence,
yet can still
empathise"
The debut work of 31-year-
old playwright Diana Nneka
Atuona, Liberian Girl has
already made an impact, performing
at the Global Summit to End Sexual
Violence in Conflict last year and
winning Atuona the Alfred Fagon
Award for Best New Play of the Year
in 2013. So what is all the commotion
about?
The play tells the story of Martha
(Juma Sharkah), a fresh-faced
fourteen-year-old girl on the cusp of
womanhood, who lives in a village
with her grandmother, Mamie
Esther (Cecilia Noble). When rebels
attack, the two head for Monrovia to
find refuge with a relative, Martha
disguised as a boy so as to not distract
the gaze of the coked-up soldiers.
But when they are separated at a
checkpoint, Martha finds herself
propelled into the surreal world of the
‘Small Boys Unit’, stuck in her false
identity as a man. From then on, you
watch as Martha, now named Frisky,
loses her childhood and becomes
numb to what she experiences, a sad
reflection of the other children in the
unit, now hardened, who must have
gone through the same traumatizing
process. Whilst at the start you
felt fear towards these soldiers,
confronting you and shouting you,
just under the skin lies a child,
terrified of the situation they find
themselves in.
This insight into the Liberian Civil
War and the perverse press-ganging
of child soldiers certainly did leave
an impact on me. Set designer Anna
Fleischle wanted to create a space that
“physically infringes on you, as if you
are somehow complicit” and, as you
are herded around the space, at one
point split into males and females,
you cannot help but feel privy to what
was happening, totally immersed in
this horrifying world. Shockingly
immediate, you are verbally
confronted by the child soldiers but
are powerless to intervene in the rape
and murder on the red earth in front
of you.
From 1989 to 1996, a civil war that
pitted Charles Taylor against rival
Prince Johnson ravaged Liberia,
leaving 200,000 dead and millions
displaced. But what particularly
stood out about this conflict was the
recruitment of children into ‘Small
Boys Units’, separated from their
families and forced to fight in a
world of rape, death and destruction.
Although Atuona doesn’t particularly
dwell on the circumstance of the war,
we are given insight into its terror
through the story of these children,
robbed of their childhood but
yearning for a father figure in their
leader Taylor, whom they call ‘Papay’.
But because of this, the story becomes
less about the particular historical
context but more one of the way
warfare distorts of childhood, one
that could be applied to any conflict
around the world.
This play represents Sharkah’s
professional stage debut, impressive
seeing the quality of her acting
and that of the rest of the cast,
especially the younger members,
such as Weruche Opia (Finda) and
Michael Ajao (Double Trouble). Her
stony façade as Frisky as she slowly
becomes incorporated into the unit
does not stop her true inner self,
delicate and caring, to shine through,
especially in her relationship abused
and imprisoned Finda. I only wish
there was more in-depth analysis of
the psyche of children in warfare,
more quiet moments between the
gun-wielding bravado to explore the
background of these children, their
mentality and how they yearn for
normalcy.
But the work did get most other
things right, helping you understand
that the world of drugs, violence and
misogyny was not the fault of these
ignorant, lost children, but the work
of the adults who manipulated them
into committing atrocities through
the promise of a father figure and
some kind of stability.
It really was an excellent play. You
felt affronted by the intimacy and
violence yet you could empathise
with the perpetrators, knowing,
through the story of Martha, that it
is not their fault but out of necessity
that they act this way. And whilst the
production might not be everyone’s
cup of tea, I think it does an excellent
job in demystifying this world
that superficially seems utterly
unbelievable to outsiders.
Liberian Girl is on until the 31st
January, at the Royal Court. Tickets are
available online, £20 each; concessions
available. Age guidance 16+.
