A Capella comes to Imperial
The semi-finals of the ICCA’s will be held this Saturday at Imperial
The semi-finals of the
International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA)
will be held this Saturday at Imperial
College. The competition is presented
by Varsity Vocals, in conjunction
with the Union’s A Cappella Society,
which is also sending three groups to
compete against a range of University
A Cappella groups from around the
UK.
Felix spoke to Henry Harrod, the
A Cappella Chair, about the progress
of the competition: “Ever since the
New Year came around, suddenly it
dawned on all the groups just how
quickly it was [coming up] ... that we
have actually quite a lot of pressure to
advertise it.”
The groups competing are The
Techtonics (all male), Imperielles (all
female) and The Scopes (mixed), all
of whom perform regularly and have
previously competed in local and
national A Cappella competitions.
There are five other teams attending.
“The fact that we’re hosting has
given everyone a massive boost,
compared to what we had at Voice
Festival... it’s nice to have the home
advantage, you’ve got the home
crowd. I think that will go a very long
way in the results. I mean, who knows
what group, if any, will win.”
Following the competition, the
winning group will go on to compete
in the Final at New York’s Beacon
Theatre in April. They will follow
in the footsteps of Birmingham
University’s Sons of Pitches, who
won the International video round
in 2013. The group has since released
their debut EP, Not Too Shabby, and
will be MC’ing the event and giving a
guest performance.
“The excitement’s definitely
building. There’s been a kind of...
issue surrounding the ticket pricing...
there are quite a few extra charges.
Having chatted to people who’d done

it before, I requested paper tickets...
it’s been good having a lot of them at
the list price”.
Despite the discussions surrounding
ticket pricing, and some crossed lines
regarding whether the event should
be an external or internal event, with
the system described as “completely
arbitrary”, all the rooms are booked.
The event begins at 19:30 tomorrow
evening (24th January) in the Great
Hall.
More than 400 tickets have already
Women’s rugby team to
headline at the Stoop
The Women’s Rugby team have
been asked to play their Varsity
match after the JPR Williams
Cup at the Stoop in Twickenham. The
match, which will take place on 18th
March, will be contested with ten
players a side. It will be 20 minutes
each way, to form a 40-minute match.
The logistics of the rest of the day,
such as timings, aren’t known yet, but
it is believed that the men’s match
will be first, and the women will
headline afterwards.
The captain of Women’s Rugby,
Mona Theodoraki, said of the event
“This is a great opportunity for
women’s rugby and for women’s
sports in general. Hopefully it’ll
inspire more girls to join and help the
club grow. Just hoping people won’t
head to the bar the second our match
starts though.”
Last year the Imperial College
Medicals side were triumphant in
the women’s fixture, winning 26-10,
which served as sweet revenge for the
26-5 reverse they suffered in 2013.
The Stoop is the home of
Harlequins FC and has played host
to many high profile matches. Next
month, they will host the England
Women’s Team as they play Italy.
The England Women’s team won the
Rugby World Cup in 2014.

been sold, with confirmed attendees
including Tom Wheeler, Imperial
College Union President, and Richard
Dickins, Imperial College’s Director
of Music, in addition to Varsity
Vocals senior management. Based
on the tickets sold so far, more than
half of those attending will likely be
Imperial students.
Henry wanted to pass on his
thanks to the Sabbatical Officers
and the Union staff for their help in
putting the event together, and the
Conferences team for their continued
support.
“It’s going to be a very exciting
time; there are going to be a lot
of emotions riding on the night,
regardless of what happens... it will
literally be a real life Pitch Perfect.”
Tickets cost £15 for students and
£20 for adults. Tickets can be bought
online, or you could buy a physical
ticket today at 13:00 in the JCR.
There will also be tickets on sale at
the door.

NBA Star John
Amaechi visits Ethos
National Basketball Association
(NBA) star John Amaechi
visited Imperial College
London’s sports centre Ethos last
week as part of a promotional drive
for the Global Games London.
Amaechi is widely regarded as one
of the best British players in NBA
history.
Amaechi had attended the event
as part of a promotional drive for
the Global Games London game
between the New York Knicks and the
Milwaukee Bucks at the O2 Arena,
which took place last week.
At the event, which was a grass roots
event for youngsters, Amaechi shot
hoops with the players. The clinic
was organised as a joint venture by
the NBA and Warner Bros. and was
named the “Looney Tunes JR NBA
Clinic”. Other distinguished guests
included Bugs Bunny and Daffy
Duck. How good they are at basketball
is open to interpretation.
Speaking at the event in Kensington
Mr Amaechi said: “These are the best
times of the Global Games, as you
really get to involve the community.
The children are able to have contact
with real players, an experience which
isn’t regularly repeated in many
other sports, and they have been
unbelievably excited.”
During his time in the NBA
Amaechi played for Orlando Magic,
Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets.
He is credited with being “one of
the world’s most high-profile gay
athletes” after he came out publicly
in his memoirs. At six feet ten inches
tall (2.08m) Amaechi played his first
game in the NBA for the Cleveland
Cavaliers in 1995, and his last game
in 2003.
