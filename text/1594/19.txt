“You all look the same to me”
Ellen Mathieson on three films with just one plot between them
This week I somehow found
myself with a day free, so
made the choice to go and see
a triple bill of Whiplash, Birdman
and Foxcatcher, which between them
have accumulated an impressive
selection of award nominations
and wins, including nineteen Oscar
nominations. So there was one thing
about them that really surprised
me, and I possibly only noticed it
watching them back to back. Though
they are set at different times, in
different places, with vastly different
plots, they are exceedingly similar.
The first and most obvious point is
the theme of these films. All feature
a male lead, trying desperately hard
to be the best that they can be, to be
someone who will be remembered.
It’s the same fear that fills all three
of these men, and the same hope.
The hope that after they die, they
will be the sort of person who is
worth remembering, the sort of
person to be discussed around the
dinner table.
Which is pretty similar to what
you find in The Theory of Everything.
Stephen Hawking’s search for the
eponymous theory is portrayed
as not only wanting to find it for
science, but as way to be remembered
too.
It’s a well known fact in the film
world that pretty much every film
is the same. This was first made
famous by Blake Snyder, who wrote
a beat sheet in his book Save the Cat
(if you’ve got a free moment, take a
look. You will never look at films the
same way). It’s a plot template that
break films up into a nice three act
structure. And it can be applied to
almost every film, often down the
page number on the script.
The thing that surprised me
about the three films is the not only
how similar they are in reaching
their climactic moments, but how
similar they are too. You could
literally switch the two scenes from
Foxcatcher and Birdman over and the
films would still make sense.
One of the big issues that plagues
all three is the lack of strong females
characters. It becomes harder and
harder to make an acceptable film
that doesn’t really feature any
women. Look at the Hobbit trilogy.
Yes, there were a lot of complaints
about the addition of Tauriel, but
there would have been even more
complains about the lack of females.
Some of the Oscar nominees are
fine, look at Felicity Jones in The
Theory of Everything for example,
or Keira Knightly in The Imitation
Game. Both played strong female
characters, and both received a Best
Actress nomination for their efforts.
I was less than impressed by the
three I saw. Emma Stone in Birdman
is wonderful as an actress (and a Best
Supporting Acctress nomination
to boot), but is not particularly well
characterised. As for every other
female, they barely exist other than
for convenience.
In Whiplash there is one female
character, and I still haven’t worked
what she added to the film, if
anything. The only thing worse than
a bland character is a pointless one.
Foxcatcher manages to have a
healthy two, but I’m fairly sure
they were only there because this
was based on a true story and they
thought they couldn’t really get away
with not adding the characters.
The soundtracks are oddly similar
too. All are incredibly drum heavy.
That makes sense in Whiplash, it’s a
film about a drummer after all. But
all three films? Solo drumming is
something that you don’t normally
find in a film score, after all you
normally have access to an entire
orchestra so why would bother only
have one instrument. I was bemused
by the fact that three films released
at the same time had such similar
music.
I feel that it wouldn’t be fair
to pick apart these films without
mention how wonderful they are.
They are well made, interesting
and enjoyable, fully deserving the
recognition that have received.
Each takes a subject with a fairly
limited fanbase (drumming, theatre
and wrestling respectively), and
make them interesting to much
wider audience.
Perhaps it is only because I saw all
three at the same time that the seem
so similar or perhaps I am just being
pedantic, but the more I think about
it, the more similar they seem to me.
