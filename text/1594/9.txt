Controversy has broken out over
the decision by 69 of the 151
Universities eligible to take part
in pressure group People & Planet’s
University League to pull out of the
survey. Imperial College were one of
the institutions to not submit a return
this year.
The survey, known until this
year as the ‘Green League’ ranked
universities based on a number of
factors attributable to environmental
sustainability. Factors in this
year’s survey include water and
carbon reduction, staff and student
engagement, sustainable food
sourcing, and ethical investment
policies.
This year, Plymouth University
came top of the table, while Imperial
College ranked 112 of 151. Last year
Imperial came 113rd of 152. In a
breakdown, People & Planet gave
Imperial a score of 0% in categories
of “Environmental Policy”, “Ethical
Investment”, “Workers Rights”,
“Sustainable Food”, and “Waste
Reduction”.
Institutions are allocated ‘degree
classifications’, with Imperial
attaining a ‘third class’. Considering
only Russell Group institutions,
Imperial was joint 16th with Glasgow
and Cambridge.
Whilst many institutions refused to
submit data, they could still be ranked
as higher education institutions
are subject to the Freedom of
Information Act and hence People &
Planet could obtain information via
alternative means.
In a joint statement dated
August 4th by the Environmental
Association for Universities and
Colleges, and the Association of
University Directors of Estates, they
praised the Green League for its role
in “helping us to account for and
improve performance.”
However, the organisations raised
“serious” concerns, referring in
particular to the “[insufficient]
timings given to universities, and
changes to the survey which are
perceived as time-consuming and
detrimental to the credibility of the
results.”
The Guardian also reported that the
University of Cambridge expressed
concern about the “[failure of the
survey to] recognise the difference
between institutions”, referring
to the older nature of its buildings
leading to concern that comparisons
with other institutions with newer
buildings would be unfair.
Meanwhile, according to a
spokesman from Goldsmiths,
University of London, providing
the information requested would
have taken “up to a month of full-
time work”, continuing “smaller
institutions in particular – those
with just one or two members of staff
working on sustainability – do not
have the resources to gather the data
requested.”
Under Freedom of Information Act
rules, organisations are not obliged
to provide information under the
Act if it takes longer than 18 hours to
collate the information.
There have been accusations that
the majority of the institutions
who chose not to take part did so
because of prior poor performance.
Commenting on reports that three
quarters of the institutions who did
not reply were in the bottom half of
Controversy as Imperial joins others in
boycott of Universities “Green League”

Students protested at the University of Glasgow Photo: People and Planet
last year’s table, University League
manager Hannah Smith said, “This is
a boycott against transparency led by
under-performing universities. When
people ask our universities what
they are doing to meet the biggest
challenges of our time, we’d expect
them all to answer.”
In a statement to Felix, a College
spokesperson said, “Imperial is
committed to carrying out its mission
sustainably and to minimising
the environmental impact of its
operations. The College recognises
that sector comparisons have a role
to play in helping us continue to
improve our performance.”
“However, in line with the approach
taken by 68 other UK universities,
Imperial did not submit a response
to People and Planet’s Green League
survey in 2014. The College shares the
view expressed by the Environmental
Association of Universities and
Colleges and the Association of
University Directors of Estates that
changes to the methodology used
in the Green League survey are
detrimental to the credibility of the
results.”
“Given this, the College considered
that the substantial time and
resources it would take to respond to
the survey would not be justified.”
The League started under its
previous name in 2007 and has been
critically acclaimed by a number of
organisations including the World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and
has received a Green Gown award
from the Environmental Association
for Universities and Colleges. Chris
Huhne, has also publically praised the
league.
