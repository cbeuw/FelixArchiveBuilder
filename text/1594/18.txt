The art of war for faceless people
The previous few weeks have
seen a surge in cyber warfare
like no other. From the
Sony Pictures hacking over The
Interview – a satire film depicting
the assassination attempt of Kim
Jong-Un, to the ISIS hacking of US
Central Command Twitter account.
The hacktivist group Anonymous
have vowed to take down pro-Islamic
extremist websites and social media
accounts in light of the recent Paris
attacks on Charlie Hebdo. The main
objective that all these hacks have
in common is not necessarily to
undermine security, but to create a
psychological impact.
Towards the end of November,
a group known as the ‘Guardians
of Peace’, or GOP for short, were
able to sneak into Sony’s computer
systems and obtain ultrasensitive
information. This ranged from top
movie casts’ salaries, such as Seth
Rogan and James Franco, to private
emails regarding Hollywood actor
Adam Sandler’s performance with his
movies described as “mundane” and
“formulaic”. But by far the biggest
weight these hacks had on Sony
Pictures and theatres across the US
was the fear factor of the 9/11 style
attack threatened by GOP. It seemed
that GOP did not want the movie
to be released at any cost which led
many to believe that North Korea was
behind the attack due to the leader’s
reverence by the regime. The US
government claimed that all evidence
pointed towards North Korea as the
culprit with methods used in this
attack similar to those used in a 2013
hack on South Korean companies.
After the terrorist threat made by
GOP, theatres at the time chose
not to screen the movie and quite
rightly due to fear for viewer safety.
Arguably the hackers had won in
forcing The Interview not to be aired
through their methods of coercion.
Naturally this led to the criticism of
Sony for backing down, with Sony
defending itself by stating that it
was the theatres’ choice to screen the
movie or not.
With regards to their actions,
GOP were quoted as saying: “We
will clearly show it to you at the very
time and places The Interview be
shown [sic], including the premiere,
how bitter fate those who seek fun
in terror should be doomed to. Soon
all the world will see what an awful
movie Sony Pictures Entertainment
has made. The world will be full of
fear. Remember the 11th
of September
2001. We recommend you to keep
yourself distant from the places at
that time.”
One of the most important aspects
of terrorism is the mental impact
that the aftermath of an attack
has. Regardless of the physical
consequences, if the terrorists see the
reaction they desire then they have
achieved their main objective. In the
case of the GOP attacks, the cyber-
terrorists managed to obtain their
desired response. In order to salvage
a comeback over GOP, Sony decided
to air the movie in select theatres
on Christmas day, making it also
available online for purchase or rent
grossing $17.8 million overall.
Another hack with a similar
fear-inducing agenda was the most
recent cyber-attack from pro-ISIS
hackers who dubbed themselves as
the Cyber Caliphate. They managed
to compromise the Twitter account
of US Central Command, filling
the account with ISIS propaganda
and threats to US soldiers. The
significance of this was that one of
the most feared groups in the world
had seized control of one of the
most prominent US government
organisations and despite their reign
lasting a mere 30 minutes, they
were able to deal significant mental
damage. The US Central Command
website commented in response:
“I recognize that this has caused
significant angst among family and
friends who are understandably
concerned about their loved ones’
safety. I want to personally reassure
you that we are taking this matter
very seriously and we continue to
take all possible measures to keep our
personnel safe.”
The recent Charlie Hebdo attack
in Paris, where 12 journalists were
murdered by two brothers claiming
to avenge the Prophet Muhammad
due to cartoon depictions of him,
brought the concept of freedom

Osama Awara discusses the modern weaponisation of hacking
"Anonymous
is looking
to not only
do mental
damage but
physical
damage to its
opponents"
"The world
will be full of
fear. Remem-
ber the 11th
of September
2001. Keep
yourself dis-
tant"
of speech into the spotlight. Many
people believed that this was a direct
attack on their freedom of expression
and went out in the streets of Paris
to express solidarity with the Charlie
Hebdo victims. In response to the
attack, Anonymous hacktivists have
declared a cyber-war against terrorists
naming it “Operation Charlie Hebdo”
or “OpCharlieHebdo” as its social
media hashtag. The first website
reported to have been taken down
was ansar-alhaqq.net, with the result
of the attack posted on Anonymous’s
Twitter account. Anonymous is not
out just to undermine the extremists
through social media and website
hacks but to also expose individuals
who are involved with extremism.
Anonymous is looking to not only do
mental damage but physical damage
on its opponents also, through their
veteran experience in cyber warfare.
As we enter the second half of the
decade, it becomes ever clearer that
cyber-attacks are more prominent
in social media websites, illustrating
that hacking is no longer used merely
for obtaining sensitive information
but also for undermining the attacked
organisation on a psychological level.
Cyber warfare is no longer about
the material gain. If you are going
to keep up with the battle of minds
you are going to have to keep up with
the battle of tweets and posts. If you
control your opponent’s tweets and
posts, you will have a major advantage
on the mental platform.
