Ever thought of joining Floorball?
“MAN! ON!” The howls
resonate through the
hall as each team eggs
the other one on. A feint to the right,
a twirl and another dodge before the
striker is through the defensive line.
She manipulates the curved head of
the floorball stick with the deft and
ease of a water bender as she races
towards the goal line. 20 yards and
closing...
The goalkeeper crouches at the
ready, his legs crossed for fear of
letting the small, aerodynamically
honed ball through. With his helmet
and padding protecting him from
the wickedly fast launches he knows
that are about to come, he tenses his
muscles, blinks away the sweat and
grits his teeth. 10 yards and closing...
The striker weaves in and out; she
knows she needs to make this count.
She looks up once more, almost 8
yards out... She moves her left leg
forward, bends down towards the ball
with her stick, almost as if to scoop it
up, and whacks the ball with all her
might.
The keeper barely has time to react,
as he leaps to stop the blur that has
become the ball. Alas, he has failed
as screams of joy come from the
opposing team.
This is Floorball: a game of
intense action and agility. A
Swedish invention, it draws a lot
of inspiration from field and ice
hockey, but is played on indoor
courts.
The Imperial College Floorball
Club is committed to training its
members, no matter their skill level,
to be the very best, but amongst
a very relaxed atmosphere. We
provide all the necessary equipment
for training and charge a modest
subscription fee.
As one of the United Kingdom’s
best Floorball teams, we have
regularly placed top three at
competitions throughout the
country. At the Midlands Floorball
Tournament, in Birmingham, we
fielded a top notch, eight member
team and went on to clinch second
place after a hard fought final match.
Our team demographic is very
mixed both in terms of gender
and nationality with a substantial
number of our players from
Scandinavia, Singapore, England and
the Czech Republic.
If you’re looking to have a lot of
fun and a great workout, get in touch
with us through email or join our
Facebook group. We hope to see you
soon!!
