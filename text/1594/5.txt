On Monday, an event hosted by
the Imperial Entrepreneurs
society (IE) saw Huxley
flooded with students hoping to see
ASOS co-founder and CEO, Nick
Robertson, give his insight into the
success of his company. As the queue
of hopeful students extended onto
the Sherfield walkway, members of
IE handed out flyers “guaranteeing”
entry to the event.
Once first year Maths students
finally left Clore lecture theatre, the
room was inundated with students
from all courses and years.
The ambience was decidedly electric
and students were very excited. Some
tried to save seats for their friends,
only to be told by members of IE that,
due to high demand, no seats could be
saved for anyone – places were to be
allocated on a first-come-first-served
basis only.
Once the crowd was finally seated,
Nick began his inspirational talk.
He came across as laid back and
confident, and was clearly used to
speaking in front of large crowds of
people.
The 30-minute speech saw Nick
take the audience on the journey
towards the highly successful
company that ASOS is today.
The fashion retailer, established in
2000, was originally called As Seen
on Screen, which featured links to
websites where people could buy the
furniture and clothes featured in
their favourite movies and sitcoms.
At the time, Nick bought the domain
name for just £50. The website gained
revenue from featuring relevant
brands on the website. Eventually,
Nick and his business partner (his
brother) decided to source the actual
products and sell them for a mark up.
ASOS saw a big change in its
business model after it hired a new
buyer, who used to work for Topshop.
The new buyer sourced the most
demanded items from wholesale
stores around London to be sold
online.
With growing success and noticing
that the fashion side of the business
was performing better, the firm saw
a transition from retailing clothing
and homewares to just accessories and
clothes.
The brand encountered a setback
in 2005 when a nearby fuel depot
exploded near the ASOS warehouse,
causing the online business to close
for six weeks, with a loss of stock
worth £5 million.
ASOS’s target customers are young
people in their twenties, particularly
women, who are fashion conscious.
Since its founding, the business has
slowly accumulated an impressive
portfolio of huge brands.
During the Q&A session after
Hundreds queue to see ASOS CEO
Nick Roberston give a talk in Huxley
Cecile Borkhataria goes to the event hosted by IC Entrepreneurs
his talk, Nick Roberston said “five
years ago, if you’d have told me that
River Island would be sold at ASOS, I
wouldn’t have believed you.”
Indeed, the fashion retail website
started out supplying smaller,
independent brands (such as Lipsy
when it was first introduced),
and as traffic grew, the business
gained traction and larger global
brands began to join the businesses
repertoire.
The ASOS ‘free returns’ policy
has been a significant aspect of the
brand’s success, and Nick said the
decision to implement it in 2006 was
simple, as he thought he should “give
the customers what they want”. Nick
emphasised that this was a marketing
spend that improved customer
loyalty, and is important as 35% of all
orders are returned.
The next priorities for ASOS are to
optimise its app, as 30% of its sales are
made through a mobile device.
Along with mobile device
optimisation, Nick hopes to
transition from spending huge
sums for Google search engine
optimisation, to building the ASOS
brand and media even more.
When I asked Nick if he would
consider opening ASOS stores in the
future, he said that he’s been tempted
to secure attractive retail spaces,
but would prefer to stay online, as
most young people spend a large
proportion of their fashion budgets
on the internet.
Nick proves that you don’t have
to be a whiz kid to found a hugely
successful business: he got a D and
an E at A-Level, yet ASOS has an
estimated worth of £159 million.
As the UK’s largest independent
online and fashion retailer, ASOS has
revolutionised the fashion industry
and continues to grow rapidly.
