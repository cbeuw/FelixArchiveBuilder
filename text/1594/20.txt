Chandor’s trifecta
Chandor has a faultless record
as a writer/director with his
previous films Margin Call
and All is Lost. The record continues
unblemished with his newest
simmering crime drama. This time
he is tackling 1981, statistically the
most violent year in New York City
– hence the title. Trying to expand
your business, and wanting to make
it to the very top is a dangerous
ambition to have, even more so when
the climate is this volatile. Yet this
does not stop Abel Morales (Oscar
Isaac) from pushing forward with
his plans. He puts in a significant
amount of deposit for a new oil
refinery, with big dreams to get
ahead
Abel faces a lot of challenges to be a
successful businessman. His sinister
rivals look as though they are up
to no good, there is a particularly
persistent District Attorney (David
Oyelowo) who is investigating Abel’s
company for illegal activities, his
oil truck drivers are constantly
getting attacked and the oil itself is
getting stolen left and right. Who
is behind this attempted sabotage?
It is difficult to tell or pinpoint
one person given how many would
profit from seeing Abel fall from his
position of power. As a hard-working,
idealistic immigrant, Abel wants to
keep things all legal and clean. He
wants to have nothing to hide but
when the atmosphere is this corrupt,
he soon learns that it becomes
increasingly difficult to have his
morality intact. His wife Lady
Macbeth Anna (Jessica Chastain), on
the other hand, is more realistic in
her vision of the world, seeing it for
what it truly is. She laughs and scoffs
at her husband’s naive beliefs.
Always impeccably dressed and
accessorised, Chastain’s supporting
performance is a real treat. “You’re
not gonna like what’ll happen once
I get involved” she says, and she
means every word. She also has
no trouble facing off against the
District Attorney, insisting that
he should treat her family with a
little more respect. Abel’s struggle
to keep everything under control as
an upstanding citizen is captured
immensely well by Isaac, an actor
who has racked up a number of
impressive roles in a variety of
relatively smaller, independent
films, largely in supporting roles.
Here, he makes for a very engaging
lead, and his charismatic presence
fits in well with the smart narrative.
Chandor is not interested in
packing the film with big, showy
scenes that tend to make their
appearances during the annual
awards seasons. Even in a story
that could call for a big bust-up
between competitors and a never-
ending body count, the film remains
intimate, staying as close to the
central characters as possible. What
secrets, if any, is Abel hiding? Is he
really as honourable and trustworthy
as he claims to be? Running into
financial troubles, and an imminent
threat that puts him, his wife, and
their daughters at risk, will no doubt
push him into the ambiguous, hazy
zone of moral values. Keeping the
violence mostly at bay, despite
the title, delivers further shock
to the audience when blood is
eventually and unavoidably spilled.
The story keeps you guessing, and
that is because even the characters
themselves cannot figure out just
what they are ultimately capable of.
A MOST VIOLENT

Mark Wahlberg goes for
the most serious, scruffy
performance of his career
so far, playing a gambling addict
who just cannot help himself go on
a majorly self-destructive path that
affects not only him, but also many
of people around him. Jim Bennett
(Mark Wahlberg) loves the rush of
playing blackjack, betting on roulette
colours, and even going so far to cut
cards with loan shark Neville Baraka
(Michael K. Williams), the kind of
person who does not look kindly
on late payments. Taking part in an
underground gambling ring owned
by violent Koreans only takes up the
night time of his life. When he is not
busy losing money and owing a lot
of important people lots of money,
Jim is a literature professor who is
struggling to keep his class interested
in the subject he is teaching.
Is he purposefully setting himself
up to hit rock bottom? It is an entirely
conceivable theory, given the way
he is acting. His shockingly cavalier
attitude towards everything certainly
suggests that whatever harm that
may come to him is of absolutely no
concern to him whatsoever. Threats
from both the Koreans and the loan
shark seem to have unfazed him.
When he is given the deadline of
seven days to come up with a grand
total of $260,000, he has no trouble,
nor any sense of shame in strutting
Wahlberg’s gamble
THE GAMBLER

Lange, John Goodman

back to his wealthy mother Roberta
(Jessica Lange) to beg once again
for money. Another very unwise
plan of his includes approaching
yet another loan shark, as if he does
not have enough of those in his life.
Frank (John Goodman) is quite an
individual who enjoys talking the big
talk, and showing to everyone who is
boss, and Goodman has fun with this
larger-than-life character, despite his
limited screen time.
Wahlberg is in a highly dislikeable
role, and seeing him as a supposedly
intelligent English professor, who is
quite possibly a genius as is hinted at
throughout the film, talking about
Shakespeare to a classroom full of
college students is not without its
awkward moments. His portrayal of
an addict is never given enough room
to breathe, which does nothing for the
actor to show anything unique in his
performance. Gambling addiction,
like any addiction, can be seen as
a disease, and the protagonist’s
relentless effort to do nothing about
it, provides interesting opportunities
for the writer to explore in depth just
what on earth is going on inside his
head.
Sadly director Rupert Wyatt is
interested only in stringing together
one implausible subplot after
another. Jim’s blossoming romance
with his genius student Amy (Brie
Larson) marks a particular low, as is
everything that comesfrom it, and yes
that includes that final clichéd scene
of a last-minute dash. The talented
Jessica Lange deserves a meatier
supporting role than this, one that
preferably includes something more
than slapping Wahlberg across the
face for being an ungrateful brat. The
film also dabbles in sports betting,
and an intentional rigging of scores
to satisfy powerful betters. The
well-intentioned message is clear: an
addiction affects more than just the
addict. The final execution however
falls short of delivering it.
