Lauren Ratcliffe on doom, gloom and the sixth mass-extinction
"The start
of the
Anthropocene
was at the
start of the
Industrial
Revolution."
Sunset for the Holocene
Last week scientists confirmed
that we have entered a new
geological era called the
Anthropocene. To put this into
context the last epoch, known
amongst geologists as the Holocene,
began around 11,700 years ago after
the Pleistocene, whose beginning
was punctuated by the wide-spread
mass extinctions of large megafauna
– animals weighing over 40kg –
apparently due to the synergistic
impact of both climate change
and the colonisation of mankind,
whose populations during this time
quickly spread across the world from
Africa across to South America and
Australia.
Like an invasive species mankind
gradually dominated the landscape,
species therein and Earth’s energy
fluxes. The proposed current
Anthropocene epoch is defined as an
age where this spread and expansion
of human populations during the
Holocene and present day has had,
and continues to have, a widespread
influence over the planet. The precise
beginning of this era, however, has
been heavily debated. Exactly when
did humans start being the main
drivers of environmental change?
A destructive new dawn
Since the late 17th
century it has
been recognised that mankind has
had a disproportionate effect on
Earth’s systems, but pinning down
a precise turning point along the
planet’s timeline has proved to be
difficult.
Many geologists have suggested that
the beginning of the Anthropocene
was at the start of the Industrial
Revolution, while others suggest it
started even further back during the
dawn of agriculture.
Last week a group of scientists
agreed that the Holocene-
Anthropocene boundary should be
defined by the first A-bomb test in
1945, which carried radionucleotides
into the Earth’s atmosphere. The
presence of these radioactive
elements ties closely with other
large-scale changes brought about by
mankind.
Triggered after World War II, the
Green Revolution pushed to intensify
agriculture and converted pristine
habitats to crop and pasture land in
order to crank up food production.
The global transformation of land
for agricultural use has been forecast
to take up over half the world’s land
surface by 2050.
To increase efficiency and yields a
myriad of fertilisers, insecticides and
pesticides began to be mass-produced
and extensively used with disastrous
consequences for native wildlife.
The imprint of these agro-
chemicals can still be seen today;
recently corn farming in the USA has
taken over the landscape to meet the
demand for biofuel production.
This in turn has caused fertiliser
run-off into the Mississippi River
and the mass deaths of marine life in
the Gulf of Mexico due to nutrient
enrichment. Furthermore, a rise
in commerce and international
transport has relocated non-native
species into new habitats, such as
the infamous Cane toad in Australia
which has since dominated and
destroyed native communities.
En-route to a sixth mass
extinction?
You don’t need much imagination
to envision how humans have
appropriated the landscape – just
look around you. Mankind has
historically exploited, manipulated
and destroyed parts of Earth, often
without thought of the consequences
for other species or long-term
repercussions for humanity. This has
led to what scientists suggest is the
beginning of a sixth mass extinction.
Again, let us put this into context.
As a whole, over the last 3.5 billion
years since the beginnings of
photosynthesis and life on earth,
approximately 4 billion species have
roamed, swum, flown and giggled
their way across this planet. 99%
of these species have subsequently
gone extinct, demonstrating just how
common extinction is; however, this
is over a very long time and is usually
balanced by speciation.
In contrast, the ‘big five’ mass
extinction events are times in Earth’s
history where extinction rates
were far greater than normal, often
defined as times where over 75% of
species were lost. These include the
infamous Cretaceous-Tertiary mass
extinction event around 66 million
years ago, when we waved goodbye to
the dinosaurs and around a quarter of
all other species.
Normally extinction rates are
actually much lower than this, with
an average 1 extinction/million
species/year. However, estimates of
current extinction rates range from
100-1000 times this background
rate and are projected to reach the
same magnitude as the ‘big five’ mass
extinctions within three centuries.
So the future is not looking so
bright, and the rapid expansion of
mankind’s populations and our
exploitation of Earth’s resources
has continued mostly unchecked,
bringing us all into a new era of global
destruction.
Sunrise and sustainability
But it’s not all doom and gloom,
I hasten to add – and you probably
knew most of this already, or at least
had a hunch. The introduction of
government environmental policies
and monitoring is reducing the
impact of some of mankind’s damage
to the planet, for instance in the case
of agro-chemical regulation.
In addition, increased
understanding is enabling scientists
to better inform global decision
makers. The Lima Climate Change
Conference in Peru late last year
reached an agreement to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, in order to
limit the global temperature increase
to 2º Celsius above current levels.
Furthermore, the Convention on
Biological Diversity have set out
specific targets – Aichi biodiversity
targets – to be achieved by 2020.
These include the transformation
of 17% of terrestrial land and 10%
of coastal and marine areas into
protected areas.
So we now know that the
Anthropocene era has arrived. What
happens next will depend on our
response to environmental change
and a movement towards a geological
era defined not by mankind’s
destruction but by our sustainable
use of the planet.
"Current
extinction
rates are
projected to
reach the same
magnitude as
the 'big five'
mass
extinctions."
