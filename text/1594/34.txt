A Fight to the Death in the World of Office Politics
Fred Fyles explains how Young Vic’s Bull misses the target in places
Three people enter. Two
people leave. Anyone who is
familiar with the BBC show
The Apprentice, in which a collection
of terminally unlikable corporate
drones are paraded in front of the
camera, will be familiar with this
format; every week a contestant is
sent packing, the grizzly tones of Sir
Alan’s catchphrase “You’re fired” still
ringing in their ears. In the Young
Vic’s latest production Bull, this
format is brought to the stage, and we
are presented with a similar dilemma.
With the recession causing their
company to downsize, three office
workers must compete for the two
jobs that will remain after (in business
jargon-speak) the ‘restructuring’.
Over the course of a mere 55 minutes,
we watch as simple power plays –
‘Why aren’t you wearing your nice
suit?’ – turn to something much more
sinister, with two corporate sharks
ripping apart their limp colleague.
Sam Troughton plays Thomas, the
unfortunate pawn in this game of
social Darwinism; with his receding
hairline, wire-frame glasses, and
slightly-too-tight shirt that does
little to hide a developing paunch,
Thomas is a difficult character to
like, let alone sympathise with.
Sweating under the stage lights like
a televised Richard Nixon, Thomas
is like a deer in the headlights before
his colleagues: the stereotypical
high-flying ice-queen Isobel (Eleanor
Matsuura) and the horrifically ‘alpha’
Tony (Adam James), described as a
person who “runs marathons to sleep
with the charity workers”.
Slowly and surely, subtle digs and
misinformation turn into something
much darker, with a clear conspiracy
emerging between Tony and Isobel;
Thomas can only watch as any
chance he had of remaining in the
job slips away from him (this isn’t
a spoiler – the game is fixed from
the very beginning). Troughton
plays the part with aplomb, his
desperation eventually spilling over
into sheer physicality as he charges
around the stage. However, while
his performance is simultaneously
heart-breaking and revolting, there
are moments where the dialogue feels
slightly stilted; in some parts of the
play, what should be lightning-quick
witticisms are delivered somewhat
laconically, disrupting the tensions.
That being said, as individuals,
all the actors are fantastic; even
Neil Stuke, whose role as the CEO
amounts to little more than a cameo,
manages to imbue his short time
on stage with a sense of sadistic
power. Special mention, however,
must go to Matsuura, who inhibits
her character with a cold, clear-
cut sensibility; quite the opposite
of Troughton’s bumbling stature,
she manages to maintain a ramrod
posture throughout the performance,
heightening her frigid physicality.
It is also Matsuura who delivers the
stunning closing monologue, giving
a bravura performance in which she
remorselessly shreds any dignity that
Thomas was clutching onto.
Director Clare Lizzimore, working
with designer Soutra Gilmour, has
made the bold choice of presenting
the action in a boxing ring; in one
corner ominously sits a monolithic
water cooler, while the audience
is divided into tiered spaces, both
seated and standing. This gives us a
much greater sense of a spectacle, and
also makes us somewhat complicit
in the torturing of Thomas; as
observers we are also collaborators,
especially when barbarous taunts
are flung from Isobel and Tony. We
really shouldn’t be laughing at such
a pathetic creature as Thomas, but
Mike Bartlett’s witty script makes it
difficult to resist.
Ultimately, while Bull is certainly a
strong play, held up by a terrific small
cast, there is a feeling that something
is missing.
Before the play starts, while
the audience is assembling,
loudspeakers blare out Frankie
Goes To Hollywood’s Two Tribes,
and Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger,
psyching up the audience in a way
that the play never quite lives up to.
Whilst watching, I was reminded of
two similar plays, which tackle the
same themes: firstly Yasmina Reza’s
God of Carnage, in which two sets
of suburban parents try and settle
a dispute between their sons, but
end up drunkenly hurling insults
at each other; and secondly Lucy
Prebble’s Enron, which exposes those
responsible for the Enron scandal of
the early-noughties.
Whilst Reza’s work bristles with a
slowly mounting tension, Prebble’s
sacrifices tension and reserve for
larger-than-life characters, who
become horrific near-caricatures
of actual financiers (although, the
play is that much more chilling
because even then the characters
are completely believable). Bull
tries to do both, oscillating between
a mounting suspense and outré
moments in which the characters are
unbelievably revolting. As a result,
we never really get a full picture of
what is trying to be done; are things
supposed to be tense, or horrifically
comic? At one point, a bit of dialogue
about sexual abuse gives us hope – if
that is the right word – that things
will take a much darker turn; but
then this is simply dropped, and
never mentioned again. Rather than
charging around in the dark, Bull
would surely be better if it had a clear
target and vision that it could aim
for. Despite the great cast and the
innovative direction, it is difficult
not to get the sense that something
more could be done with the plot
to elevate it beyond a simple tale of
office politics.
