SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
We accidently attributed an article
to another author, when in fact
Kunal Wagle wrote the piece last
week “All change come election
time.”
THIS WEEK’S EDITORIAL
Fancy finding out how we write news?
It’s not just scrolling through facebook
looking for orgy posts, we promise.

This week we are doing an
analysis on the rising trend
of Facebook pages ran by
Imperial students, that are gaining
a lot of traction again as people are
sitting January exams and therefore
also spending a lot of time on
Facebook.
With pages amassing thousands of
likes at a time, and individual posts
being liked and shared too, and then
throwing in the fact that students are
talking about the page and showing
it to their friends, the cumulative
reach of these pages in total, all things
considered, can be quite vast.
One of the pages we investigated
this week is Imperial Tell Someone
Something, a page that is no longer
active and was shut down last
academic year, after the admin was
reported to the College Tutors. This
page was especially slanderous, with
the admin also being particularly vile
to students voicing their complaints
and refusing to take posts down that
were mentioning their name if the
admin thought the offensive posts
were justified.
Both the admin and the page
was reported to both ICT and the
College Tutors, and although College
Communications could not discuss
individual cases to us, as far as we
are aware, nothing was done to the
individual despite his full name
passed over to this board of senior
staff that deal with disciplinary
procedures and are also there to keep
the welfare of the student body in
check.
Students are joining these pages
because of the sense of community
they emulate, not just for the joke
posts and the humour. They join
because they see a page named after
their university, and, as a student
body that is often criticised as being
fractured and divided, enjoy these
online windows that capture the ethos
of Imperial so succinctly.
Liking it takes no effort at all, and
suddenly any post from that page is
catapulted straight to their timelines.
Despite College offering all of
their policies on IT, branding and
image use, in their responses to our
questions this week, in practise no
page has ever been shut down or any
action taken against students running
these high-profile platforms. And
we are not saying they should; most
pages and their posts are amicable
and are not a cause for concern at all.
However some posts tread a thin
line, and with such a large audience
and seemingly no consequences
for what is posted and when, and
Imperial seemingly powerless to
intervene, these pages are almost a
ticking time bomb. With admins
changing as people graduate, and
some pages taking content from
anyone through those Google
submission forms, one pressed button
or poorly worded message can reach
the corners of campus in a matter of
minutes, including the student it may
be about.
If people are joining a page because
they are using the Imperial name to
draw that large audience in, Imperial
should also be intervening when
students come to them for help over
the posts. It’s all well and good to have
these policies, but when College is
aware of the pages and they are still
posting defamatory posts and even
attacking students, College is failing
in keeping their students safe.
For now though, there seems to
be nothing more threatening than
students attempting to organise a
distasteful orgy, along with some
pretty dodgy science chat-up lines.
Enjoy them, even post to them
if you like, but remember that
anonymity can make people feel
even more alone and compound
that feeling of being targeted. People
may be more brazen on one side
of the screen, but they are equally
more vulnerable when on the other,
receiving side.
