Iam not a fan of musicals. There,
I’ve said it. When you grow up
spending every waking moment
with ‘theatrical types’ who sit around
reciting ballads from Les Miserables,
musicals can make you hate them.
Listening to song after whiny song
which all fail to add any story to the
show, and with music which is at
best a notch above mediocre, for me,
musical theatre is a curse.
That said, as much as I despair
admitting it, there is the odd bit of
musical theatre I’m quite partial
to (big U-turn I know, bear with
me). Chicago can’t really go wrong;
Billy Elliot was a good tory-bashing
laugh, and Cabaret, well that’s just
pretty awesome (although it’s a push
even calling it musical theatre). The
difference is that in these musicals,
the scenes between the songs don’t
feel like they’ve only been included
to give the band a break. A real plot,
with interesting characters and,
to top it off, good music is such a
rarity in musical theatre. So, with
all that considered, this week I went,
voluntarily, off to see the Morphic
Graffiti production of Batboy.
Batboy is about a boy, who is a bit
of a bat, and a bit of a boy. In what
feels like the deleted scenes from a
low-end episode of South Park, the
show opens in the beautiful town of
Hope Falls (or High Falls… I can’t
remember), and a delightful group of
fundamentalist Christians stumble
across what can only be called a mini-
Dracula. Right from the get go we
are greeted to a huge, spectacular, if
pretty dull opening number. With a
set not far off a west end stage, and
the costume and lighting to match,
all the indicators are that of a high
end production. Directed by Luke
Fredericks for Morphic Graffiti and
produced by Paul Taylor-Mills Ltd,
the team behind Batboy is stunning
for a small theatre show.
The problem is that in musicals,
all the singing and the dancing and
the band mean that actors have to
wear microphones (another thing I
hate). In principal this would have
been ok, but, whether it was the fault
of the American accents or the tech,
I couldn’t understand a word. For
anyone who has ever been on stage,
two of the first things you are taught
are to perform towards the audience,
and diction. Not for the sake of it,
but because above everything else,
the audience have to understand
what you are saying. So it was for the
whole first half, in which we see a
typical American family take in and
teach Batboy, that all the big musical
numbers sounded like a glorious
chorus of mumbling.
Somewhere between a college
humour sketch and a tame version
of the Book of Mormon, the first
half of Batboy doesn’t really know
what it wants to be. Having jumped
around the stage with almost no
purpose for the first thirty minutes
of the show, in the space of one song
Batboy suddenly develops into a well-
spoken, intelligent and (somewhat)
caring member of the family. With
his newfound wisdom, Batboy
desperately wants to be accepted into
the community, but of course not all
goes to plan.
Usually, I’d leave out the rest of the
story not wanting to spoil it, but this
time there isn’t really much plot to
talk about. The first half continues
in much the same vein, stuck in
second gear with little prospect of the
show picking up. It’s a shame since
the production value of the show
is particularly impressive for such
a small venue, but the mixture of
random serious moments and a white
guy rapping (badly) makes the whole
first half feel oddly ridiculous.
As you can imagine, I did not have
huge hopes for after the interval
but remarkably, the second half
opened with vastly more energy and
enthusiasm than before. A number
of particularly funny moments and
an almost interesting story finally
gave me something to smile about.
Although the Christian revival scene
fits all the secular clichés, the music
(a jazzy number with a bit of life) had
my foot tapping away to the almost
certain irritation of the guy sitting
next to me (he seemed to enjoy the
show even less than I did). Followed
by a few raunchy scenes between
Batboy and his pseudo adopted
sister, and a hilarious appearance by
“mother nature”, the show reached
a somewhat sexual climax that the
second half certainly deserved.
Topped off by an amusing twist at
the end, the show finished on a high
with the only regret being that it took
them over an hour to try and impress
us.
The cast need to be given their due
credit when it comes to performing
in musical numbers. Although few
performances really stood out, more
experienced members of the cast such
as Lauren Ward and Matthew White
playing Mr & Mrs Parker came across
as more comfortable on stage and
felt more convincing when singing
and acting. That is not to say that the
performances of Batboy, played by
Rob Compton and of Shelley Parker
played by Georgina Hagen did not
impress. However, too many musicals
compromise on a performer’s ability
to sing, act or dance. It takes an
incredible performer to pull off all
three parts of musical theatre well
and although the cast of Batboy gave
it a good shot, such performers are in
particularly short supply.
So the question is would I go see the
show again? No, probably not. I hate
musical theatre and Batboy really
doesn’t fulfil many of the criteria
which would make me change my
mind about a musical. It is funny, and
at times even the music is good. But if
you’re like me, as good as the second
half was, the first is just too boring to
voluntarily sit through. As is often
the case, large chunks of the audience
absolutely loved the show; I guess I’ve
just got too many of the critical genes
in my family. I’m just way too boring
for musical theatre (give me Hamlet
any day). But if you’re not like me
and actually like to have a good time,
should you go see Batboy? I don’t
know. Go watch it and if you loved it,
I will happily take the credit - if you
hated it, I told you so.
Bat Boy: The Musical runs until
31st
January. Tickets £22 adults; £18
concessions.
