Conquering Mount Rinjani

Chris Richardson’s epic three day hike up Lombok’s beastly volcano
"if you're
heading to the
archipelago be
sure to make
conquering
Rinjani a top
priority."
To the unacquainted, volcano
climbing in the Indonesian
archipelago might seem a little
dumb, but in reality there’s only so
much tanning and partying you can
handle before you get the itch to do
something a little more challenging.
Having done my homework, I’d come
to the conclusion that Mount Bromo
on Java was a glorified tourist trap,
and the two hour climb offered by
Mount Batur on Bali wouldn’t really
scratch my hiking itch. So I decided
on Mount Rinjani on Lombok, a
treacherous three day hike, to be
completed before passing out on the
neighbouring Gili islands.
Lombok is just a couple of hours
east of Bali by speedboat, and a lot
more chilled. Truth be told, I think
this is the Indonesia a lot of people
are seeking when they head to Bali,
but miss as they remain too glued to
the buzzwords and trodden paths.
Many make it as far as the Gilis,
three small islands just off Lombok’s
northwest coast, but venturing
further out is certainly worth the trip;
there’s excellent surf and beaches,
untouched villages and countryside,
and – of course – a massive looming
volcano to be climbed. Some would
argue that Balinese hospitality is
unrivalled, and appears to dissipate
quite quickly as you move away from
the island, but I didn’t find this to
be the case at all. After sparking up a
conversation with a couple of Polish
medics on the boat over from Bali we
headed to book the tour and retired
early ahead of a 4am start.
The first day was a somewhat
forgiving seven hour stroll, partly
down to the stretch being non-
technical, but mostly down to us
being well rested, having exerted no
energy over the days leading up to
the trip. It’s mostly gentle incline
through meadows and forest until the
last couple of hours up to the crater
rim, which is slightly steeper incline
but still perfectly doable. Here we
set up camp for the night, indulging
in tasty food by a roaring campfire,
soaking in the views of the gorgeous
crater lake below over a tasty sunset.
I’ll admit that from here the summit
looked pretty close, and as the day
had been almost too easy, I heavily
underestimated what was yet to come.
After a solid eight hours sleep it was
2am, and so we began to work towards
the summit in time for sunrise. To
describe this final stretch will still
do it no justice: despite being only
3800 metres, I’d say it rivalled the
6200 metre Huayna Potosi climb I
completed in Bolivia last year. The
stretch to the summit from the crater
rim is essentially a massive volcanic
sand dune; for every three steps you
take up, you side back down two, a
disheartening state of affairs lasting
three to four hours. In any case, the
eventual views are worth it, as you’re
rewarded with epic panoramas on
both sides – Bali and the Gilis behind
the crater lake to the west, and a
scorching sun rising over Sumbawa to
the east.
Following the summit is the gleeful
skip back down to the crater rim
camp. From here it’s possible to bail,
but we opted to venture inside the
crater rim, adding an extra night to
the trip that was certainly as much
of a highlight as the summit itself.
After three tough hours downhill,
we eventually reached the ethereal
lake that had caught our attention
since we first made it to the rim on
the previous day. This was the perfect
place to camp, as behind the lake were
some picturesque hot springs, ideal
for chilling after nine hours of hard
graft.
The final day involves climbing
back out of the crater and heading
down the other side, continuing along
a different path to avoid any route
repeating. It’s a tolerable eight hours
that pass by fairly quickly, assuming
you’re still running on the high
from having managed to summit.
Finishing up puts you in the perfect
spot to carry on to Lombok’s famed
Senaru waterfalls, where you can kick
back and relax. Alternatively, you
could head hop on a boat to another
island to sink a few beers and revel in
the fact that you survived, which is
what I did. It certainly scratched my
hiking itch and also helped to keep
the Bintang-induced beer belly at bay;
if you’re heading to the archipelago
be sure to make conquering Mount
Rinjani a top priority.
Rinjani Trekking Club –
Lombok’s hiking specialists
When I first docked in Lombok I
went to have a chat with Mr Ronie
and the gang at Rinjani Trekking
Club (RTC), whom several sources
had told me were highly reputable.
I’d stress that this is the most
important step that you want to get
right; you need a reputable agency
with knowledgeable guides, reliable
equipment, and decent food to keep
your energy levels high. RTC has all
three. Furthermore, they are – to my
knowledge – the only organisation on
Lombok dedicated to conservation
work, organising sustainable hikes
and also cleaning up after less
environmentally-conscious groups
along the way.
They’ll also give you options when
it comes to crafting your route. If
you’re opting to go to the summit,
which I’d strongly suggest, then
you’ll want to take the route outlined
above: commencing in Sembalun and
finishing in Senaru. The great thing
about this route is that it’s so well
structured; you get the summit out of
the way while your energy levels are
high, get to camp at the crater lake
(not possible otherwise), and finish
at some serene waterfalls rather than
arid savannah. Hiking with RTC
certainly made this experience; their
professionalism coupled with their
ethical approach to hiking makes
them the obvious choice for your hike
up Mount Rinjani.
