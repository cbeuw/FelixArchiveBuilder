Taking another step into the smartphone world
The new Felix App Update is available to download this week.
Felix Technology takes a closer look at the latest version.
This week Felix released the
latest version of its app for
iPhone. It includes a major
revamp of the way it works, adding
benefits both in its user interface
and in its engine for the user. Today
Felix Technology takes a look at what
we should expect from the latest
addition to Felix’s digital “empire”.
For those who had either of last
year’s versions of the iPhone app,
the difference is obvious from the
start. The user interface has been
completely changed. Gone is the
splash screen that prompted the user
to “Click on the cat to launch Felix”.
No, the user is sent straight into the
action of the news page. Users are
greeted with the top three articles
for the section, and an easy to read
table of the remaining articles for the
section.
One of the first things you notice is
the speed. Previous versions of Felix
have been designed in a way that they
always download the latest content
instantly, images and all. This takes
time. Precious time. Now it’s all
different. The Felix app downloads
the article once and saves it. Beyond
that, you can manually refresh to
get new content. This has many
benefits, but speed is a major factor.
Now that all your articles are already
downloaded, the app doesn’t try and
download them again whenever it
loads. It’s just there, instantly.
But these benefits obviously have
the occasional sacrifice with them.
In order to ensure that the app loads
as quickly as possible, images are
not downloaded together with them.
This means that the app downloads
the images again each time it
loads. This has both advantages
and disadvantages. The major
advantage is that it saves memory,
ensuring that the Felix app doesn’t
take an unreasonable amount of
space on your phone. The obvious
disadvantage is that images don’t
appear instantly.
One big change to the new edition
of the app is the ability to read articles
while offline (without images).
As long as the article has been
downloaded to the app (the latest
content can be downloaded using the
traditional “pull-to-refresh” feature
in the table), you can relax with the
knowledge that it can be read even
when you aren’t connected to the
Internet.
So what else can you do on the new
Felix app? You can access profile pages
for all of the Felix section editors, and
use that to contact them with any
comments, feedback or suggestions
that you may have for their section.
It’s easy to get to this page; just swipe
to get to the right sidebar, and click
on the section editor you wish to talk
to.
There is a search feature, which
allows you to search for articles based
on article name, article teaser, author
name or author username. To access
this incredibly useful feature just
swipe to get the left sidebar and click
on “Search for an Article”.
When viewing an article, there are
many things you can do. You can
send the link for the article by email
to a friend. There is also a button
that opens Safari and takes you to
the comment section of the article,
so that you can have your say, or
see what others are saying about the
article. And of course, you can access
profile pages of each of the authors of
the article.
Felix is always looking to improve
the way that it presents content to
"The
differences
are obvious
from the
start"
"One of the
first things
you notice
is the
speed"
you, our esteemed readers. If there is
a change you want us to make to the
app, or indeed anything we do, please
don’t hesitate to contact us. The best
way to offer feedback about the app
would be to leave a review on Apple.
But if you want your comments
to be aired in a slightly less public
environment, please email kmw13@
imperial.ac.uk with any suggestions.
The Felix app is available to download
from the iPhone App Store. If you have
your smartphone handy, you can get it
