Tha Inter-collegiate raging
•ana to a f i t t i n g climax during "Morpby
Week". High pitched rivalry resulted
in the mascots changing hands several
times,and College Presidents walking
with their heads permanently looking
over their shoulders for would he kid-
nappers.
In the London University World
I.C. i s again showing it's great
superiority on the sports f i e l d , the
Rugby and Hookey teams dealt with their
f i r a t round U.L.U. Cup opponents, S i r
John Casa and Wye College, i n a ruthless
manner. On the Literary side, the
debating team smashed a Kings team to
defeat in the f i r s t round of the debating
competition.
a l l these activities are great moral
boasters to the College, but Oh! hew
piteful i s the support that they receive.
Scoring tries is so much easier, when
the touohline i s packed with supporters;
and winning a point i n a debate i s a
matter of form when willing voices from
the floor reiterate the Speakers views.
So why not forsake the one-eyed
monster, why not give the drinking
arm a rest, and help the College teams
to greater honours.

Dear Sir,
May I advise the Entertainments
Committee to brush up their modern
history before they make more blunders
similar to that at last Saturday'a hop,
24th Ootober.
(For their information. King
Edward VIII aooeeded to and *Miea*e*»
from the British throne in I936J.
Apart from giving ammunition
to those.critics of the narrowness of an
Imperial education, this blunder caused
chagrin to my oharming partner from N.T.
C.CjjUj. who, quite rightly thought she
deserved the "six-pound prize".
however, on discovering the
nature of the prize, she indicated, in
nO uncertain manner, what she thought
Messrs. H i l l end Matthews should do with
their potatoes.

Dear Sir,
The decision made by the
President and Council to make Fresher's
Dinners more formal has surely oome as
a welcome one. I would now like to
make a suggestion that would alter the
whole tone of the dinner and would
enhance the impression laid upon
Freshmen to a great degree. The
suggestion being that wine and not beer
should be drunk at table.
Surely when going to an
important dinner i t i s not customary to
emvxaage em evening's lewaj entertainment
oauaed by people taking advantage of the
plentiful supply of beer. But rather
an evening meal in the presence of
senior officials and guests of
importance, when the mode of eating,
drinking and general behaviour should be
restrained i n accordance with the
respect to be shown to the guests.
A half bottle of wine between
two people, with water ad l i b for anyone
who i s particularly thirsty oould be
considered entirely adequate for the
meal. On top of this the attitude of
the conception of the meal should be
more important than the mere preference
in taste for beer over wine; the former
being so readily obtainable after the
dinner, i n tha Union Bar, as i s now and
Dear Sir,
I waa most upset recently to find
the College flag flying to celebrate the
fact that the number of women students
at I.C. is now i n excess of 100.
Hitherto the flag has been flown on such
auspicious occasions as the College's
offioial birthday,cor proclamation of
succesea on the fields of sport. With
the best w i l l in the world one cannot
describe this latest feat of femino-
multiplication as a sporting achievement;
i s i t then as a landmark i n the history
of the College that we are to regard it?
It has long been a cherished custom
to bewail the lack of beautiful young
girls at I.C.,and to while away lectures
by conjuring up visions of hundreds of
lovely maidens to sooth the brow and
delight the eye. This used to be a
perfectly safe pastime. Nobody
envisaged any actual change in the
status quo, and consequently no thought
was devoted to what the results of suoh
a change might be. We are now reaping
the harvest of this negligence. Like
many a scientific experiment, alas,
large discrepancies are developing
betwixt theory and experiment. It is
being brought home that while 40 or so
women are distractions,and just about
tolerable as such, any increase forms
an incalculable menace to a l l that we
hold nearest and dearest. With
increasing vigour w i l l the perennial
squeaks of "Why can't we oome in the
Bar?" be squoken. With increasing sest
w i l l the bright young things disfigure
their anatomies and the view with
hideous garments of fluorescent hue (an
extremely bright red pair of stockings
has neon bedazaling the precincts of
late). Fly the flag by a l l means,sir -
but f l y i t at half mast.
Tours despondently,
L.H. Peters.
may i t always be a custom.
I oontend, however, that beer
should not be considered a mitable drink
for an important dinner where Freshers
are being formally introduced to the
College.
Please may there be more
correspondence over this matter, perhaps
from an offioial of the Union Council or
Wine Tasting society, when some facts a
and figures could be surveyed.
lours Truly,
M.C.A. Brett. (Civil 2)
Dear Sir,
The distribution of daily
papers i n the Union Lounge i s most re-
markable. The total supplied is only
19, and this seems olearly inadequate
for a lunchtime gathering of up to 80 or
100.
Here is a complete l i s t of the
daily supply;
3 copies of the Daily Telegraph,
Daily Express,
Daily Mail,
2 copies of the Daily Herald,
News Chronicle,
The Times,
1 copy of the Daily Mirror,
Daily Sketch,
Daily Worker,
The Guardian.
Besides asking for an overall
increase,-! want to make a particular
request for at least 1 more Guardian and
preferably 2. My reasons are;-
1) There are frequently two people
waiting for i t .
2) The majority of Foreign Students seem
to prefer i t .
3) It i s a serious paper which cannot
satisfactorily be quickly glanced
through and this adds to the shortage.
4) It has long ceased to be a
predominantly regional paper and is now
the only serious paper whioh claims to
be radical.
Which Committee is responsible
for the supply of papers, and w i l l i t
pleaae correct the shortage?
Tours faithfully,
J.P. White,
