No. 139 FRIDAY NOVEMBER 13th 1959 4d
MORPHY W E E K
Although the a i r between the Colleges
of 0 & G and R.C.S. had been f i l l e d
with expectation since the Soraaenoeraent
of the Session, i t was not until Morphy
Week that the storm broke; then in
three short days the supposed ingenuity
of R.C.S. was matched against the ob-
viously superior brawn of C ft G.
On the day of the l s t Guild's
Union meeting, a combination of lack
of foresight by the Guild's President,
and a smartly executed plan by a group
of R.C.S., resulted i n the Spanner
going southwards, and not to the Union
meeting. A somewhat surprised Jolyon
Wove was left seated in the road shouting
â€¢Guilds, Guilds;Hill " i n rather pathetic
tones.
Rather upset at having lost their
treasured mascot, a large percentage
of -be Guilds' Union Meeting went
round to Weeks Hall to try, i n a
vain attempt, to recover i t . Mr.
Forstar, President of S.C.S., waa then
invited to visit the Guilds Union but
as he was i n the middle of an important
'ladies' meeting found i t Impossible
to accept.
The Spanner, now suitably bedeoked
in R.C.S. colours, then went on-a trip
to the South Downs. A series of olues
led the pursuers past such famous spots
as Rodean School, an ancient Monaster*,
W E E K S HALL S I E G E
a mental Establishment, and picking up
the last due at the village Inn, arrived
at a ring of trees i n the middle of no-
where. Meanwhile towards the end of
the Guilds Union Meeting, a rumour was
circulated that the spanner was now i n
residence i n the middle of the Bound
Pond.
Led by a rather purturbed Pres-
ident, a band of Guildsmen wondered
over to Kensington Gardens. The
deeoy Spanner, a sherry bottle i n
Guilds colours, was nowhere to be seen,
so the Guilds President for want of
exercise (he said later) swam out
to what turned out to be an upturned
table. We are pleased to announce
that the fish he oaught during his
epic swim, won Third Prize i n the
Lower Wopping fishing contest that
was taking place at the same time.
Morphy Day, essentially the
o f f i c i a l I.C. Bag Bay, due to the
considerable amount of damage that
had occurred i n previous years had
taken on a new look. , Instead of the
dour do or die defence of the Tow
Path Bridge, the constituent Colleges
had agreed to wage battle over a rubber
tyre on a part of the Tow Path well
away from Boat Houses and people.
The College winning the tyre (i.e.
holding i t when the Lowry Boats passed)
would then be presented with the other
Colleges mascot.
After nearly half an hours fighting,
the tyre was Guilds, and although a few
R.C.S. man fought on, the rest trouserless,
muddy, and a l i t t l e dejected swayed the
vice president of R.C.S.'s opinion and
Mr. Green conceded victory to Guilds.
Later that evening the thermometer
was presented to the Guilds president,
unknown to the Guildsmen, R.C.S. had
plotted to recapture Theata, and two
plans had been prepared. As i t happened,
a much simpler opportunity arose, and
perhaps the finest piece of mascot
removal resulted i n the thermometer
returning to R.C.S. hands i n twenty
minutes.' To f i l l i n the details, an
R.C.S. Fresher walked into the dinner
with the main Guilds party, sauntered
behind the top table, removed theata
and walked out the other door-way!
Thursday saw the last of the
B.C.S. Freshers Dinner, and Guildsmen
in force, made the Union building
crowded. The evening began with an
unsuccessful attempt to remove the
R.C.S. President, and so the Guildsmen
removed to Queens for a Council of War.
The Dinner was of a very high standard
and made ewen higher by the presence of
a large proportion of the ladies of the
College.
Deciding on their plan of campaign,
Guilds returned to Union Bar, and packed
i t almost to capacity. Picking on the
officials of the S.C.S. Union f i r s t of
a l l , Guilds soon had a trouserless Mr.
Edwards singing to them. When Mr.
Forster returned to the Union, after
changing (premonition?) his Kangella
JOURNEY'S END
was well received and after he had fin-
ished, despite his struggles he was
removed to Stonehenge where he was
deposited barefoot.
The triumphant President, returned
to Weeks Hall i n the early hours of
Friday, and recounted his almost
inorediilous return to I.C.

FOOTNOTE;
The l i t t l e boy who removed the
spanner from i t s hiding place i n the
tree has, so rumours haws i t , been
made on Honory member of Guilds Union
- We can but hope he makes the grade
and comes to R.C.S.1
