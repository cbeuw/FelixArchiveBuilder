The Kings team hinged their arg-
uments on the theme that one was more
experienced at 21 than at 18 and con-
sequently one was more competent to
decide whichi way to exercise the vote.
Unfortunately for them they based this
argument on their own experience by
claiming that they had matured greatly
at University between the ages of 18
and 21. This enabled Les Allen summing
up for I.C. to point out that only a
few per oent of the 18 to 21 age group
went to University. Was there an
increase in maturity amongst people
who had to mark time doing or avoiding
National Service? People who had no
opportunity to take responsibility -in
their oountries affairs and.who in
oonsequence took no interest i n i t
even when they became 21? He doubted
i t .
The judges retired and came back
with the pronouncement that they were
unanimous that I.C. had won and that
I«s Allen's speech was the best of the
evening.
The Kings team was not terribly
strong and I.C. w i l l have to improve,
as they can, on this showing i f they
want to win this years .cup. One thing
is clear, I.C. would b i helped immensely
i f an audience came and supported the
debates) debating to empty chairs
is not calculated to bring out the best
in any teas*
GUILDS ON FIRE
Once again the November 5th oele-
brations at Harlington proved extreme-
ly popular. Many people who had
been unable to buy tickets beforehand
arrived at the gates in varied forms
of transport, and having been charged
the appropriate sum were allowed in.'
Thi3 year the Entertainments
Committee spent rather a larger sum
on fireworks. Even though the display
lasted only fifteen minutes, i t seemed
to be much enjoyed.
The bonfire this year was made up
mostly of wood from the old Guilds
building and proved to be one of the
largest ever. So much so that i t set
the hedge behind on fire and had the
police extremely worried as flames
twenty or thirty feet high swept
over the road.
The inside of the paviJS.on made
a sharp contrast with the eflld, damp
and somewhat foggy atmosphere of tae
playing fields. Couples danced,
jived, drank and ate innumerable hot
dogs in the gaily decorated and very
warm upstairs portion of the pavilion.
Nearly everybody seemed to be better
behaved this year and only two f i r e -
works were thrown onto the dance floor
to drown temporarily the lively music
of Derek Pyke and his band.
The evening's entertainment ended
at about 10.45 p.m.twith a rousing
Auld Lang Syne and i t was very com-
forting for the Entertainments Com-
mittee to see so many people really
reluotant to leave.

JUDO
On Wednesday the Judo team re-
venged themselves for their previous
defeat,by a decisive win over Gold-
smiths. There were six contests, and
instead of the usual one point oonteats,
the best of three points were fought.
This did not affect the result which was
5 wins and a draw to I.C. These contests
were stopped inside the time, and a varied
collection of techniques tried.
M O T O R I N G N E W S
The big news of the week i s that
of Bo's arrival i n Brighton with 55
minutes to spare. Pushed up a l l steep
h i l l s by several keen Guildsmen with
only the driver aboard, Bo won her
medal and pennant for punotual arrival.
This rather laboured performance
which i s unusual for Bo who usually
romps up a l l the h i l l s with a f u l l
complement aboard was due to her run-
ning on only one of her two cylinders.
On the previous Friday, the exhaust
valve seating developed some cracks
and water poured into the cylinder.
This had been temporarily repaired but
the repair had proved to be inadequate.
Bo was rigged lip with a temporary
oooling system, but she lost water at
a fantastic rate, probably faster than
the 3team cert'. In fact, during the
trip, about }0 gallons of water were
poured in.
Aa usual Jezebel followed tj»»
•veterans" down to Brighton, taking
longer over the journey them ever
before. The dry day brought out many
motorist^ but roadworks along the
A 2
3 'caused large jams. Unlike last
year, Jez had to keep on the left for
most of the way, giving vany to vet-
erans travelling on the "wrong'' side
of the road. Brighton was reached
just before 1 p.m. The absence of
Bo detracted from the excellent lunch
to which the crew was invited by the
Guilds Motor Club.
t Sunday, A l l Saints Day, dawned
clear and soon became brig^fi* most
went to Church at Wytham, which was
packed. Lunch followed, and the
afternoon was spent with an Oxford
guide ( l i t t l e g) touring some of the
Colleges. These were impressive
for their quietness i n such a busy
City^and their partially restored
beauty. We were generously enter-
tained to teat iti a College room, and
departed our Viriou3 ways after a
mem^ible weekend.

HOCKEY u l . CUP.
In the l s t round of the U.L. cup,
I.C. made a slow start against Wye College
Good approach work was spoilt by bad
finishing throughout the f i r s t half.
Consequently at half time I.C. had scored
but one goal.
Cn the resumption of play Wye went
near to equalizing but the I.C. defence
remained cool and collected. Suddenly
I.C. sprang to the attack and scored
four quick goals whioh left Wye reeling.
At this stage I.C. were playing their
best hockey of this season and with better
luok the score might have been further
improved on. Thus the f i n a l result was
I.C. 5 - Wye 0.

Although a small college, Wye must
not be underestimated since last season
they reached the semi-finals of this com-
petition. This win reflects much credit
on the I.C. attack. The defense showed
some weaknesses which will have to be
remedied,nevertheless Syd Lenssen,
obtained his f i r s t 'Shot-out' of the
season.
As yet the l s t XI i s having mixed
fortunes having won 4 and lost 4. The
2
n
d XI has made a fine start with an
unbeaten record. The strength of the
olub i s underlined by the support fOr
the 3rd and 4th XI's which are accounting
well for themselves.
The mixed hockey have won,lost and
drawn the three matches r_laye*? As in
previous years more support is required
from the ladies especially the freshers.
Those interested 3hould contact Tony
Miller Room 43, Garden Hall.
GOLF
The captain and one other member
of the team played regularly for the
University 2
n
d team - the Blasters.
They have both won more than half their
matches.
At present arrangements are being
made for a tour i n Scotland with match-
es against several of the Universities
north of the border.
The season promises to be a good
one as considerable support ha3 resul-
ted from our f i r s t meeting, when about
4
0 people attended.
The introduction of group lessons
is a success and some dozen people
go up to Highgate every Wednesday.
Our matches this term have ended
i n uncertainty - both times the
opposition has failed to turn upj no
doubt they had been pre-wamed of the
a l l round strength of our team.
ATHLETICS
The result of the Athletics Club
Trial on Wednesday 4th November proved
that the strength of the Club may be
even greater than last year. However,
at this t r i a l not a l l of last year's
outstanding athletes were able to attend.
The be^t performance *as put up by
the University f i r s t string 220 yds run
runner A.W. McDonald, when he clocked
12.1 seconds for 120 yard3, and 22.8 for
220 yard3 against a wind. A runner who
never seems tp fade from the fore in
College Athletics is John Collins who
produced an extremely good effort when
winning the mile in 4 mins. 35 seconus.
I am told that the results of the
t r i a l compare very favourably, with
those of Cambridge University only two
weeks earlier.
