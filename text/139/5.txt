GLIDING
Midday of a sunny July Sunday found
as lasted i n the cockpit of Phoenix, tha
I.O.O.C. Skylark II sailplane, having
just oast off froa a somewhat bumpy aerO-
tew behind an ancient Tiger Moth. Soar-
ing conditions were quite good, and I
coon found quite a reasonable thermal
whioh gave about 7 fps of l i f t , after a
bit of coaxing. Climbing i n smooth,
strong, thermals i s a relatively relax-
ing process, and I had plenty of time to
oonsider the next move. I have taken off
from Lanham 10 minutes previously, having
declared Nympsfield as my goal, on the
advice of Prank Irving. I wanted to do
a oross-oountry flight of more than 50k.m.
in order to qualify for the third and
last leg of my silver C certificate, and
as Roger Vaile, the I.C.G.C. captain, had
completed his own silver C the previous
week, I was reasonably determined to
succeed. There was very l i t t l e wind
blowing and so from that point of view
the direction of flight was unimportant.
The Nympsfield direction had the two ad-
vantages that there was only one airway
to worry about, and that the country was
good, both as a source of thermals, and
far landing in. Hympsfield i t s e l f i s c

adles W
N
W of Lasham, and i s the home
site of the Bristol Gliding Club. I t i s
situated on top of a ridge overlooking
the Severn and Stroud valleys.
I followed my f i r s t thermal up to
aloud base at 5»0OO», and as conditions
seemed good, I decided to press en* with-
out delay. There was a promising cloud
about a mile away i n the right direction,
and so I headed straight for i t , putting
the speed up to 55 knots so as to get
out of the intermediate sink as quiokly
as possible. I lost about 1,000' i n
flying to this cloud, but there was a
good thermal underneath i t , as I had
hoped, and I worked this one back up te
cloud base. The clouds themselves were
too small to make worthwhile any attempt
at entering them i n the hope of finding
stronger l i f e , and i n any case my exper-
ience of cloud flying was ( and is) so
limited that suoh an attempt would prob-
ably have made me airsick.
I proceeded i n this way, hopping
from cloud to oloud, and covered about
20 miles i n the f i r s t hour. My f i r s t
obstacle then appeared i n the form'of the
Green One airway, which runs i n an East-
West direction and i s about 5 miles wide.
Gliders are not encouraged to loaf
around i n airways and so I out directly
across i t by flying due North, a l l the
time keeping .well clear of clouds with
their possible lurking airliners. In
so doing I lost a l o t of height and by
the time I was clear of the airway I waa
down to about 1,500'. Fortunately I
was directly above a disused R.A.F.
aerodrome, and I was thus: Ibis to con-
centrate an finding l i f t . Otherwise I
would have had to keep one eye open for
possible landing fields, and i n the res-
ulting confusion I would probably have
come unstuck and had to land. However,
I was lucky and found a good thermal
whioh soon had me baok at 5 , 0 0 0 ' . Far
the next two hours I flew f a i r l y leisurely
along the northern edge of Salisbury
Plain, flying over Brise Norton, L i t t l e
Rissington, Cheltenham, and ending up
over Gloucester.
.My map shewed Nympsfield to be
about 12 miles to the south, but I didn't
know exactly where the site was, and i t
had the reputation of being d i f f i c u l t
to find from the air. The v i s i b i l i t y had
been excellent up t i l l then, affording a
magnifioient view for about 50 miles i n
each direction, but with the approach
of evening i t was rapidly worsening, and
I couldn't see far more than about 5 miles.
In the meantime a headwind of about 5 knots
had sprung up from the S.W, and an ugly-
looking sea breeze front had formed about
y miles to the south. Sea breese fronts
make the a i r i n between themselves and the
. r i x n c
"caaMvery1
l U b l e and hence oompleVeJLy
unsuitable for' soaring.
However, I fumbled about for an hour
ant. a half i n the front i t s e l f, where
there were a few weak thermals, and ended
up about 3 miles N.W. of where I hoped
Nympsfield was. After a long sorutiay
of my map I had finally deoided i t could
be on one of several nearby ridges when
to my Joy I spied a distant Tiger Moth
land on one of them. Further inspection
shewed two gliders parked outside a
hanger, the sun glinting on their wings.
This oonfirmed that i t was i n faot my
goal, but 1 wasn't sure i f I had enough
height to get there. However,.by ther-
mal had petered out, and as there didn't
seem to be any others nearby, I decided
to press on regardless. There were sev-
eral fields i n the Stroud Valley into
whioh I oould have landed i n the event
of not reaching i t .
However, fortune favoured the Bold,
and I ran into 'a thermal whioh, although
weak, gave me ample- height to reach my
goal. I was thus able to enjoy a few
minutes of pleasant relaxation, s i t -
ting back i n bovine content and admiring
the magnificent view over the Severn
estuary.
After a very high and wide A i r - "-,
ouit, a l a B.0.A.C, I f i n a l l y landed at
1730, after 5^ hours of decidedly hard
work. I waa given a very warm welcome,
and more-to the point, a good cup of
tea. The f i r s t job was te phone back
to Lasham and i t was decided to send out
a private aeroplane (a Miles Messenger)
to tow me back. The return flight took
about 50 minutes and was most enjoyable
on aooount of the by now excellent v i s -
i b i l i t y and the very smooth a i r which
mads aero-towing such easier.
Baok at Lasham I found that i t
had been a very good day for gliding,
and both Frank Irving and Paul Minton
had separately flown their Skylark III
around a 100 k.m. triangle at a very
high speed indeed.
The day ended, as was inevitable,
with a long session i n the Lasham bar,
and this I think i s a good place to
stop.

HOPMANSHIP
A depressing truth must by now,
have beoome apparent to every socially
minded fresher. This is that selection
of a really suitable female at a oollege
dance i s by no means an easy matter.
The reason for this i s the eleven to
four man to woman ratio l a the
University, a Senate House-inspired plot
which i s painfully evident on entering
the cook-pit of a oollege hop.
With this urgent problem in view a
handy l i t t l e booklet "The Woman for You"
oy A. Hopman (Nosuoh Publishers Ngns.)
has recently been published as a guide
to the frustrated student. In i t the
author, who submits an interesting
personal record of having defended
allegations of abduction, seduction;
breach of promise, legal paternity and
l i a b i l i t y as co-respondent as an
indication of his authority in the
gentle art, draws upon a'mine of exper-
ience to compile a code of practice for
college dances. The whole strategy i s
unfolded in this priceless volume, but
for the benifit of those who cannot *
afford the book, or whose self -
conciousness would not allow them to be
seen reading i t , the essence of i t i s
given here.
The f i r s t task on arriving at the
dance i s to inspect the prey, opposition,
and the terrain, i.e. the women, men and
their distribution, both in number and
position. Usually the women w i l l be
sitting around the%aides (apparently
engrossed in chatter, but watching you
as d e a r l y as you are sizing up them,
make no mistake) and the men will be
jam-packed into a few square yards at
one end of the floor, also talking and
watohing (the women). If the organiS"
era have done a good job the numbers
should be about even.
The next job is to make a close,
but, unobserved, surveillance of the
female element, noting any particularlv
acceptable pieces «f.beauty, .this-is best
done by strolling the length of the
floor, as unconcernedly as possTtsew-
After extensive develppement of observ-
atory powers, and much practice, i t sho
should be possible to deoide whether to
remain or to repair to the Bar. The
beginner, however, w i l l now probably
have noticed about a dozen pretty faces,
several pairs of shapely legs, and
perhaps ten body assemblies worthy of
further investigation.' If he i s lucky,
in two or three cases one of each of
these w i l l a l l belong to the same g i r l ,
and the game i s on.
Now to make an aqquaintance. Here
is where the f i r s t signs of opposition
atpear. . That zrouio of men standing,
near her, who seem to have not the
faintest notion that she exists* have
already noticed what you have seen. Aa
soon as the next dance i3 announced the
there w i l l be a simultaneous dash to
gobble her up. Here you must decide
whether she i s worth a momentary loss of
dignity. Assuming she i s , and that you
win the race, you have about ten minutes
- until the M.C. calls 'Next Dance
please' - to find out whether she really
is what you want. This obviously'
depends on what you are, in fact,
looking for, and the author aevotes
fourteen chapters to methods afi
discovering i f she is. Such detail
cannot be attempted here, but the main
fact is to remember to avoid wasting
time on the 'Do you come here often?
What college do you oome from? Do you
like the band?' roundabout. This is
not to suggest, though, that you enquire
whether she is an advocate of free love;
at least, not until you are sure of your
f ooting.
.During the course of the dance you
are advised to keep an eye out for any
more agreeable merchandise you may so
far have missed. Do this with regard
to the third finger of the left hand
which is, happily, held in a prominent
position when dancing. This will
prevent future disillusionment.
So the dance ends and you must
make a snap decision whether to lure her
by offering her a drink, or to try else-
where. This i s the focal point Of the
evening. If you think she i s worth
having, you may be surprised to find she
doesn't feel the same about you, and
w i l l "Have to go baok to a friend".
Don't offer to go as well, or she may be
foroed to spell out the invitation to
get lost. On the other hand. if_she
aeeepta, you may regret that gin and
orange when you learn later that she-
lives at. Watford.
One happy evening-, though, you will
find that she only drinks orange squash,
and lives no further than Earl's Court.
Then you can be sure that you have truly
developed the art of HbpmanshipL_
