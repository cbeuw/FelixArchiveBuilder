SOCCER
Curing the past fortnight the
aoooer olub has met with mixed suooess
hut i t i s expeoted that as the teams
are now beginning to settle down results •
w i l l improve to their usual high level.
The seventh XI have played a further
four games sinoe you last had the pleasure
of reading Felix, winning one and losing
three. However, inspired by their new
oaptain Paul Davies, and with some
further hard training in 'bottle' this
trend oan be rapidly reversed.
The 6 t h XI by reason of their
pre-eminent position play many other
College 2nd and 3 r d XI's and having
started off the season with a batch of
League games are fighting hard to maint-
ain their place in the U.L. League.
The 5 t h XI are probably the most
successful side i n the olub to date having
had several good victories. A long t r i p
to West Ham far an unsatisfactory 0-0
draw must have been very strenuous for i n
the next game St. Thomas's Hospital
out them up by 10-1. With a good start
in the League however, perhaps they well
emulate the glorious deeds of last years
"Fighting Fifth*.
Like the 5 t h XI, the 4 t h team have
had same unfortunate cancellations,
which have given them l i t t l e opportunity
to show their mettle. They lost a very
close League game 1-0, to old rivals,
Inst, of Ed. last week (31st Oct.) but
the stirring enoouragment of oaptain,
Brian Wheeler, should prevent a re-
occurence of this.
The 3 r d XI promise very well this
year having already had a great victory
over Kings by 5-1 i n the League.
Urged on by the blood-curdling threats
of George Bebster, "captain extraordinary",
they have won 3 of their last 4 games
only losing 3-2 to Southampton University
I H .
Another good start i n 'the League
has been made by the 2nd XI who have
beaten both Sings and U.C. already.
The team i s settling down well now and
under the able leadership of Chris.Ryan
they should Improve on last years 2nd
team record.
Last but not least we come to the
1st XI. The season having started
with several close-fought games, apart
from a crushing 6-0 preliminary round
win i n the U.L. Cup, the team have had
varied luck against the opposition i n
the past fortnight. A 2-0 lead against
Lulwioh Hamlet was wiped out i n a
fighting r a l l y by the visitors i n the
second half. An injury to the I.C.
goalkeeper then gave Dulwich the ad-
vantage t o run out eventual winners
by 4-2. Much the same story occurred
in the following match against L.S.E.
when I.C. again had much of the play
but unluckily the goalkeeper Hugh Payne,
broke his collar-bone just after half-'
time. Playing with 10 men I.C. were
s t i l l well i n the game until in the
closing minutes a quick cross and a
running header gave L.S.E. the victory.
I.C.1
s next gams against Old Bradfieldians
was a l l too easy and the 8-0 win was
poor preparation far the stem struggle
against Kings on the following Wednesday.
A 3-3 draw might well have been converted
into a good win with a l i t t l e extra effort
a l l round.-
Training sessions are s t i l l being
held every Tuesday and Thursday lunch-
time, (meet i n the Gym at 12.30), and
in spite of Mr. Webster the Captain
enjoys these tremendously and positively
guarantees that everyone else w i l l
eventually.
After a respectable start to the,
season, with a l i t t l e more spirit and
enthusiasm on the field and a l i t t l e
more sport off the field, this oould well
be a vintage year for I.C. soccer.

BOAT CLUB
A crew whioh had never rowed
together before, distinguished
i t s e l f last Saturday by winning the
Sabin Cup, awarded annually to. crews
not of Junior status. The large
handsome tankard was won by f i r s t
beating Thames Tradesmen, after a
rather scrappy row, by 1 length.
In the final, the crew oombined a
l i t t l e better, end took 4 lengths
off Ibis Rowing Club.
This i s the f i r s t I.C. win i n
this event sinoe 1951, and augers
well for next year.
B.H.P.
CROSS COUNTRY
The teams have continued in fine
form winning three matches and losing
one, two more being declared void due to
people going off oourse. On Wed. 28th
the seoond and third teams beat Marjpns,
due mainly to some fine running by
E. Bennett (l),C.R. Huntley (2), P.
Auton (3) and C. James ( 4 ) .
On Sat 31st, whilst nine members
of the olub were running for the
University against Cambridge, a weak-
end second team easily beat teams from
University College and Goldsmiths. This
race saw this seasons debut of an allegedly
unfit G.P. T i l l y who lead the team to
victory followed by A.G. Hooker (2) and
E. Bennett ( 3 ) .
Racing over an unusually short course
on Wed. 4th, the second team defeated
R.A.F. UxPridge and L.S.E. but were them-
selves well beaten by a very strong Borough
Road team.
The Bust canary "Scrubbers'' match
against R.U.C. was held on the same day
when the captain lost yet another 5 pint
due to the teams unfortunate victory.
The main oulprits being R. Woolf ( 3 ) ,
D.G. ream (4)/D. Rymer (5) P.S. Smith
(6) and B. Butler ( 7 ) .
Saturday 7th saw the olub pioneer
several new courses during the Midlands
matoh at Leicester. When the three
main parts of the f i e l d reported to make
their own different ways baok to the
finish, the team was in the commanding
position of having a l l seven men in the
f i r s t sixteen in a f i e l d of about f i f t y .
In the meantime the seoond team,
due to losing a member i n the fog
were unable to chose a team in the
match against Shoreditch T.C.
HONOUR FOP ICWSC
As a result of the f i r s t matoh
played by the University Womens
Hookey XI against Cambridge Univer-
sity, which London won 8 - 3»
Biliary Tompsett has been selected
far the oombined London-Camlridge
team. This team later played a
combined Universities team from whioh
is chosen the England Universities
XI.
The soccer olub i s s t i l l managing
to run 7 teams at the C03t of much
anxiety and hard work on the part of the
olub officials. This would be con-
siderably eased i f air- (repeat ALL)
players would tick pff a£ cross off on
the availability'list-and also tick off
early on team sheets. Remember this
is your olub and you are not at Univ-
ersity to be spoon-fed, so play your
part and look at the 'board when you
came into the Union.
RUGBY
Last Wednesday I.C. entered the
seoond round of the U.L. Rugby cup com-
petition by beating S i r John Cass
42pts to 11 — 6 goals and 4 tries to
1 goal and 2 penalties.
Try scorers for I.C. were Strick-
land (1), Peart (3), Bruce (2), Banks
(1), Milward (l), Lanoe ( l ) , and
Thompson ( l ) . Peart kicked four
conversions and Bregazzi two.
Outstanding for I.C. was Peart
who alone scored 17 pts and came very
near on several other occasions.
There was l i t t l e to c r i t i c i s e in this
I.C. team except perhaps some rather
slack play during the second half
whioh -allowed Cass to score 11 points.
The game started with a bang and
the I.C. forwards immediately showed
their superiority over a very ragged
Cass pack. After ten minutes I.C.
started to move the b a l l to the backs
with immediate results. For the
f i r s t time this season the sacks reallj
looked dangerous and soon started
piling up points. At half time I.C.
led 26-0 and the 3oore was a true
reflection on their superiority;
backs and forwards and played well
and for a relatively untried combina-
tion showed good cohesion.
In the second half this cohesion
was not so apparent and Cass were
allowed to penetrate our defence on
one occasion and score; though I
feel that their try came about hut
beoause of lethargic tackling but
rather through an overeagerness on our
part to score mere points. If one
could pick out individuals who were
outstanding i n a team whioh played so
well then they would be Randal Peart,
Dave Howell, and Pat Bruce. Randal
always looked dangerous when i n
possession and one feels that his t a l -
ents are rather wasted at f u l l back.
Dave Howell our new hooker was a real
live wire i n the loose. Pat Bruce
scored two tries but was worth many
more. He was always up at the front
of the play ready to pounce on any
mistake.
Well we won 42-11 but a ward
about Cass. Although they were in
their own words 'outclassed' they
never once gave up trying and after
the game they were a l l there at
closing time i n the I.C. bar. A
good bunch of fellows and a pleasure
to play.
In the next round of the cup we
meet Kings and i f we are to regain
our cup that they borrowed last year
and I'm sure we w i l l , then we need
plenty of support. . So come along and
support us i n this match. Details
of coaches etc. w i l l bo put up on
the union and rugby club notio boards.

SWIMMING
During the last two weeks, the
fixtures of the olub have imprnwerl..
The* f i r s t team defeated Kings 5-0.
Chatham R.E. 4-3,and a Joint "Sap-
pers" team from Chatam and Aldershot
6-1. A oombined 2nd and 3rd team
played Marphy Richards and won 6-3
and the 2nd team drew 3-3 with
Chelsea. The f i r s t team standard
has definitely improved, but the 2nd
team i s s t i l l lethargic. Lack of
fixtures seems to be the trouble here,
and more b a l l praotioe would result
in a l l the olub teams improving.
A l l the olub teams are now looking
forward to the U.L.U. knock-out
faandioap competition, the prize for
whioh i s a pint of beer.
Here's hoping.
