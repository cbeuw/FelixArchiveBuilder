Very shortly the Anderson Com-
mittee Report on student grants w i l l
be presented to the House of Commons
and i t s findings made publio by the,
usual white-paper. Apparently draft
copies are already i n circulation to
those i n the know and from the informa-
tion available, secured from reliable
sources, i t seems probable that the
following recommendation w i l l be made.
All parental contributions to grants
w i l l be abolished, and the necessary
means test w i l l cease to exist. This
step has been advooated by the majority
of students for many years, and should
a b i l l to this affect pass through the
House, students w i l l welcome i t , and
enjoy the greater independence that
should be the outcome.
It i s very interesting to consider
the possible and even probable steps
whioh w i l l follow. The University
Authorities have long been trying to
discourage students from taking on
general manual work during the vacations.
Shey want the 52-week academic year.
The National Union of Students, i n
policy and opinion, agrees with this
viewpoint, and i s therefore pressing
for the grant increase necessary to
enable students to live oomfortably
throughout the year, without having
to accept parental help, or having to
resort to well-paid labouring jobs.
Of oourse such proposals oould
not go forth without any ties, and the
N.U.S. agrees that under the above
conditions, the students should be
given compulsory vaoational academic
work, to be handed i n or examined after
the vacations. This i s perhaps fair,
and the Universities claim that not
only i s i t desirable, but i n a few years
time, i t w i l l be necessary, i n order to
cope with the expansion of courses and
fields of study. But how w i l l a l l
this affect the students and their
education? Surely such policies as
this are going to hasten the end of
the true university, putting i n i t s
plaoe great 'glass-house' cram-shops,
churning out by the thousant,super-
speoialized, pseudo-intellectual
morons, 'things' as remote from
people,as I.C. i s from the moon -
sorry the sun.
Speculative this mi^it a l l be, but
the above trends are real, and the
actual emergence of the 52-week
academic year oould be within the
next two or three years. What w i l l
i t mean, and how w i l l the future
students of this college or any other
college react to these sweeping changes?
How w i l l the Postmaster General
delivery a l l the Xmas mail? Tour
voice influences these matters, - l e t
i t be heard!

How often has i t been said, that
a theatre' critic's,first night and i l l -
considered reviews have killed many
an interesting play on the spot?
How often do I wish that i t were true.
Yet this i s very rarely the case.
Audiences seem to derive some form of
masochistic pleasure from ignoring the
wise words of those "enlightened"
gentlemen and continue to go, almost
as i f to spite them.
This would seem to be the sad
story of "Aunt Edwina", new running
(at least I think that it's s t i l l
running) at the Fortune theatre.
On the first night the critics very
rightly damned i t , (I was there on
the fourth night, and I doubt whether
i t had got any worse i n that time).
The management decided to withdraw
the aforesaid disgusting object at
the end of the week. On the sixth
night, the author of this farce,
William Douglas Home, presents him-
self to the audience and says, speaking
of the critics, "that means we
dramatists, (how dare he call himself
by that t i t l e ) are writing for 10,
14 or 16 men and that i s bad, and
i t i s wrong. The poor demented
crowd cheer ecstatically, and the show
goes on.
Let my advice remain. Do not
go and see this petty farce. Do
not go and see the reincarnation of
Edwardian drollery. Do not go and
see this charade.
Although I have not yet had the
innocuous pleasure of visiting the
"Duke of York's" to see Miss
Margaret Lookwood i n "And Suddenly
Its Spring", I am informed on author-
ity, good enough not to make me want
to v i s i t the "Duke of York's", that
this play might f a l l into the same
general category as "Aunt Bdwina".
In either case i t i s highly probable
that the audienoe would shout their
joy so much that you would be unable
to hear the humour i n any case.
The Russians have at last laun-
ched themselves into the "wide screen".
At La Continentals i s showing a
magnificent Soviet film entitled "The
Beast", which once again proves to
us that the Russians are s t i l l
capable of producing excitment on a
large scale. I t i s not the story,
as you might expect of a monster from
outer space, wielding tentacles and
six legs, but a rather moving account
of the explits of Iiya Muronets, a
legendary super-hero of the Russian
people, who by the use of his great
sword was able to punish evildoers.
If your taste i s one for the mag-
nificent and grandiose, then perhaps
you w i l l be interested i n the new
Cinerama film entitled "South Sea
Adventure" at the London Casino.
Personally, I feel that a l l
Cinerama productions so far have
tended to be the same, relying for
their impact on large postcard views
of South Sea Islands etc. This i s
not an exception. A film for the
Cinerama enthusiast rather than the
dramatically minded film-goer.

It i s with great regret that we
inform our readers of the sudden death
of Richard ("Dick") Litchfield. Dick,
as he was known to everyone, collapsed
and died on his way to I.C. last-
Saturday. Dick was a veteran of
the First World War. Whilst serving
with the R.E., he lost one leg and
part of the other foot at the battle
of Vimy Ridge. Despite this dis-
ablement, he carried on with his
trade of cabinet maker (he was a real
,craftsman)with H.M.V. after the war..
He oame to I.C. i n 1951 and was
reoently promoted to head porter.
He always had a smile and a kind word
for everyone. He w i l l be missed by
. a l l who knew him.
