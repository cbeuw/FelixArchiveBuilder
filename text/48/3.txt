Springtime i n Kncland, and lovers are straying
Cer trie glad green and along the bright Janes,
Sj-.rkling with laughter and carelessly playing,
Youth i n i t s glory, young blood i n i t s veins.
Sing of the Springtime, the time of the morning;
Days when the dawninf: o f l i v i n g , seems bright.
Sing of the Springtime; too soon comes the yawning,
Yearning, for peace i n the blankness of night.
Sing of the Springtime; co:<te j o i n the mad caper.
Sing u n t i l time c a l l s a halting for breath-
Softly t h e y l l sing then, entombed where a taper
Casts a cold gleam on the d u l l mask of Death.
The storms continue, but the E d i t o r i a l column
emerges for an Easter respite, scarred with traces of
the old wars. Though the Spelling Controversy, the
Carnival Controversy, the General Studies Controversy,
the University Controversy, the Hostel Controversy,
a l l have had t h e i r place i n t h i s column, we leave them
alone and l e t peace and the joys of meditation f a l l
from our weary pen on to our f a i t h f u l readers.
While those who have developed the habit of
turning straight to the E d i t o r i a l to find the latest
howl w i l l be disappointed, there must be others who
w i l l sigh with r e l i e f now that FELIX, after so
turbulent term, has curled up i n front of the f i r e t o
dream of the vacation, while Viewpoint and Letters
continue the c o n f l i c t s .
We have heard i t said l a t e l y that FELIX i s
much more serious than he used to be, and f a r less
funny. We can only lament our lack of humour, and
pray for gifted w r i t e r s , but on the other point we
make no apology at a l l . As a responsible servant of
the College, FELIX must act i n an adult way concerning
student l i f e and any matters which may influence xne
conditions i n our College. In particular coverage of
the new expansion programme deserves as much space as
we can supply, and f a r more facts than are made known to
us. I t i s our business t o act i n accordance with the
students' interests.
But we are wandering from the Springtime philosophy
of the poem which herds t h i s E d i t o r i a l , and which has not
yet j u s t i f i e d i t s appearance i n t h i s column. I t was
written as a reminder that there are more things i n t h i s
world, Kr. Syllabus Setter, than are dreamt of i n your
philosophy, and that the v cation which i s even now
surging towards U3 i s one of the times for finding t h i s
out.
F i n a l l y , t o degenerate from a lofty E d i t o r i a l "we"
to a very personal " I " , I wish i n the last paragraph of
my f i n a l E d i t o r i a l to thank a l l the members of the FELIX
s t a f f for t h e i r fine v/ork during my term of o f f i c e .
While I should not i n "aimess mention ^any names without
mentioning them a l l , I feel that the work of the
Production Department i s p a r t i c u l a r l y worthy of the
highest praise. We have several people who never achieve
(cr even aspire to) the glamour of p r i n t , but. who work
consistently a.nd quite admirably to ensure that FP'LIX
appears. Thanks also to several other r e t i r i n g members:
Secretory Mary L i s t e r ; News Editor Louis Cohen;
Photographers Peter Clewer and John Andrews. The new
Editor, D.C. Kale from India, a Miner, w i l l have a great
deal of work taken o f f h i s shoulders i f t h e i r successors
are as h e l p f u l a.s the above r e t i r i n g s t a f f have been.
The second issue of next term w i l l be FELIX No. 50.
v/e hope t o run something of a bumper number. I f i n s p i r a -
tion comes t o you over the v-.-c., please l e t us have-the
results.

The Hag Coixmttee are very interested i n the creation
of an I.C. Jar-Cry. I.C. has always been lacking i n t h i s
essential complement t o student high s p i r i t . F e l i x w i l l
print any promising suggestions i t receives, and the Rag
Committee w i l l c a l l a meeting to decide on the I.C. cry.
Here i s a chance for a student t o make h i s t o r y , so l e t
the efforts pour i n .
V I E W P O I N T
W H A T I S G O I N G O N ?
It i s very easy t o c r i t i c i s e decisions which Ir-ve
been taken, ana i t i s singularly useless. Imperial
College P-as been asked to 3rbm.it pirns for i t s expansion,
based on the assumption t l r t we are to have r i o r i t y over
ether claims for land and b u i l i i n g i - s they be coir
available. V
/
e have a chance of influencing decisions
before they are mode, a.nd t h i s makes the absence of any
o f f i c i a l r-O-vs or views deplorable. T
Ve students might
possibly be able to ra-ke useful suf; esiions; we may even
have one or two food Ideas.
Rumour has i t that the post graduate departments -re
to expand most, and indeed, i f we are t o provide the best
men rather than the merely very good men, i t i s necessary
for uo to have an unequalled post graduate department.
Such a department deserves t o be f i l l e r with the best
graduates available, irrespective of t h e i r o r i g i n a l
University or College. Yet personally I should l i k e to
see a goodly proportion of them ex. J.C, undergraduates.
P/hr.t about them?
Are our undergraduates a.s highly qualified for t h e i r
jobs as they ought t o be? Wander round a.ny f i n a l s ye--r,
l i s t e n to the S t a f f , talk to the employers, not one of
those groups i s s a t i s f i e d . Yet the present syllabus i s
a good one. The Boa.rd of Studies and the Externa.1
ixariiners are both conscientious bodies. Jievertheless .
on the whole, Imperial College produces, say, the chief
chemist, rather than the head of department, the technician
rather than the managing director.
Much money i s to be spent on expansion. Please
spare a l i t t l e for improvement. We hive the opportunity,
let us take i t .
I have two suggestions to make. F i r s t I should l i k e
to see hostel accomodation expanded and to make i t com-
pulsory for undergraduates to spend the f i r s t two years i n
a hostel. Secondly, whilst I have no quibble with the
award of B.Sc's, I should l i k e there to be some non-
academic q u a l i f i c a t i o n required before an A.R.C.S.) A.R.3.M
or A.C.G.I, were awarded. What form t h i s takes i s not
essential, but, for instance, because a b i l i t y to persuade
others that you are right i s so essential i n l i f e , attend-
ance at a minimum number of Dinners i n H a l l would be
reasonable.
What annoys me most i s that no suggestion can be
constructive u n t i l we have some information. Please, w i l l
someone t e l l us what i s going on?
