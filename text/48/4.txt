Dear S i r ,
Our Union purl Hostel .-re far from be inf. adequate
for a college of the size,of T.C., and. on t h i s count alone
extensions t o the present f a c i l i t i e s are highly desirable.
With a hostel of such a size as t o accomodate a far higher
proportion of students than the present one i s capable of
doing, the corporate l i f e of the College would be increased.
It does not rollovi, no never, that such an increase
w i l l necessarily transform the "I.C. sausage" - pardon
my use of your metaphor - into whatever desirable type i t
is that you may envis-ge. 'lather i t seems that the
general result w i l l be t o produce a person who i n addition
to having been well-stccked with technique has imbibed a
certain amount of a s o c i a l atmosphere i n a society which,
by virtue of i t s closed nature, w i l l smack somewhat of a
ghetto. I n fact i t does not appe' r that the improvements
you demand, and which I assure you I am far from decrying,
w i l l greatly improve the q u a l i t i e s of personality i n our
future technologists. To those who have these q u a l i t i e s
i t w i l l be a boon perhaps, t o those who have not i t w i l l
be a social amenity; the 'sausage' I fear we s h a l l always
have with us. The best hope i s that by improving the
environment the far r- rer man of personality w i l l be
fostered thereby.

Dear S i r ,
While agreeing with the bulk of your e d i t o r i a l i n the
last issue of FELIX, I f e e l that your idea of a large hostel
i n a single unit c a l l s for some comment. Surely one of
the things wrong with I.C. nov; i s i t s size. To exist as a
r e a l university with the "well-bred club atmosphere" re-
quires a College size of not more than about 500 students
(The size of most 'Oxbridge' Colleges).
Nothing w i l l be gained by building a gigantic hostel
to house 1200 or 1500 students - the only atmosphere w i l l
be that of a dormitory. I believe the answer i s t o plan
for a number of hostels, i n t h i s d i s t r i c t i f possible
s u f f i c i e n t i n a l l to give each student at least one year's
residence, but one small enough t o exist as a compact unit
i n i t s e l f . Each should have i t s own lounges, refectory,
etc., and should cater for students reading as wide a
range of subjects as possible.
This is' a long-term plan, but i f we are determined t o
create a r e a l Technological University, some such arrange-
ment iB the only one possible.
Yours etc.

Several other l e t t e r s express s i m i l a r sentiments. My idea
of a large h o s t e l i n a single unit was an idealised rather
than a geometrical notion. The fundamental underlying idea
is that there should be a. large number of students l i v i n g
w i t h i n a stone's throw of the College

A l a n D u f f i e l d .
Owing t o a s u r f e i t of dances, the annual debate with
Bedford on Friday vies rather smaller than usual, but those
present enjoyed a debate of unusually high standard.
For Imperial College "Jr. Spriggs proposed "That Music
be the Food o f Love" i n a quick f i r i n g , w e l l i l l u s t r a t e d
speech. He Was ably countered by K i s s Ruth Meadows o f
Bedford, who analyzed the proposer's Freudian tendencies
and her own i n unequivocal terns.'
Mr. Pocock and Miss Wendy Dwyer seconded f o r t h e i r
respective Colleges, with speeches which although good
both - suffered a l i t t l e from nerves.
The f l o o r speeches, which followed, were w i t t y and
cogent and led t o an uproarious informal derate. P h i l l i p
Allsop l e d the opposition atta.ck with an attempt at "impar-
t i a l " a n a l y s i s , while Mike Rich convulsed everyone with an
innocent story of the Ladies of Spain.
The Motion wo.s defeated by 14 votes t o 4 with 4 absten-
sions, but the donate contimied furiously over coffee and
sandwiches i n the Lower Dining H a l l .
A New Departure i n General Studies,
One oTThe most persistent oritiscms o f the General Studies
Leoturea has been of the passive part taken by those attending.
Possibly as a r e s u l t , a debate was held i n the Union on Marcfe
5th on the motion "This House considers s o c i a l welfare may
reduce i n d i v i d u a l r e s p o n s i b i l i t y " .
Proposing, Mi1
. Alan Peacock, M.A., o f L.S.E., Btated that
i t was not s o c i a l welfare i t s e l f that he was attacking, but
the method by which i t i s being carried out. I n d i v i d u a l
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y means having the w i l l and the opportunity t e
conduct one's own a f f a i r s and t o take important decisions.
The increase i n 3tate organisation i s r e l a t e d t o the decline
i n l o c a l governmental c o n t r o l and e f f i c i e n c y .
Opposing, Mr. Michael Stewart.M.P. and one-time President
of the Oxford Union, agreed that l o o a l government badly
needed overhauling, but declared'- with what seemed to the
w r i t e r rather doubtful l o g i c t h a t as a crowd i s leas res-
ponsible than the individual,,•so the state can be more
virtuous than the o i t i z e n . I t was t o be expected that i n a
c i v i l i s e d community those with advantages i n health or wealth
should help those at a disadvantage. People only appear to
be l e s s responsible than t h e i r predecessors because of
improved standards o f beha.viour.
Seconding for the proposition, Mr. N.F.E.Blackmore,
President of the L i t . and Deb. S o c , considered s o c i a l
welfare i n i t s present form was"the thin end of the wedge"
and that causes and remedies have become so obscured that
i n d i v i d u a l r e s p o n s i b i l i t y haB had to be replaced by nation-
alism - which can be strongly objected to on e t h i c a l grounds.
Mr. S. Ruhemann, President o f the P o l i t i c a l Society,
seconding for the opposition, said that much of todays social
welfare was r e a l l y state charity; only when i t i s the result
of c o l l e c t i v e i n d i v i d u a l action - the contradiction is only
apparent - i s i t permissible. He concluded the principal
speeches by asking i f the actions of unemployed or uneducated
people could be considered responsible.
There were only 10 minutes l e f t for speeches from the
f l o o r , the two best points being that the welfare state seta
a maximum on human endeavour and that the individual today
i s not freed from r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , but feels separated from i t .
The v o t i n g was close; 100 f o r , 92 against and 21
abstentions, and i t would have been better to have cut the
speeches from the platform, none of which showed outstanding
debating s t y l e , t o give speakers from the f l o o r more time
to discuss ideas as they came up. Such a procedure,
although not i n the best debating t r a d i t i o n , would have
been closer t o the aim stated by the Chairman; but perhaps
the organisers o f Special Studies do not consider under-
graduates capable of i n t e l l i g e n t discussion.

Dear S i r ,
The success of the Union Debate held on Thursday,
'larch #atjh. has l e d t o many requests f o r another, t o be
held at"the beginning of next-term. A Union Debate sub-
committee has been formed f o r the purpose o f choosing a
motion and i n v i t i n g outside speakers, and t h e i r task would
be greatly f a c i l i t a t e d by suggestions from members o f the
college.
' I f anybody has any ideas would they please pass
them on t o me or t o a member of the sub committee.
Yours E t c ,
