"More daring than L a Ronde" the advertisements i n
the tubes say. Hm . . . Well, perhaps. I f you f i n d
the i n t e r i o r of a m i d - V i c t o r i a n French b r o t h e l daring
i t c e r t a i n l y would be. But i f you look forward t o
t h i s f i l m as an aphrodisiac you may be disappointed.
The f i l m i s based on three s t o r i e s by de Maupassant,
"Le Masque", about a dance tragedy, "Le Maison T e l l i e r "
about the v i s i t of Mme. T e l l i e r ' s "young l a d i e s " to one
of her country r e l a t i v e s , and "La Modele" about the t r i -
b u l a t i o n s of a young a r t i s t ' s love f o r h i s model. I
should l i k e to say nothing at a l l about the f i r s t , i t
was almost ruined f o r me by reading a c r i t i q u e before 1
saw i t ; i t i s r e a l l y f a r more subtle than most o f the
c r i t i c s r e a l i z e d , and should p r e f e r a b l y be seen with an
open mind. Also don't be s u r p r i s e d i f the emotional
impact doesn't a r r i v e u n t i l some time l a t e r . The
"Maison T e l l i e r " episode has been h i g h l y p r a i s e d , but
f r a n k l y i t i s both inept and t a c t l e s s , something of
which one would hardly have thought Max Ophuls, the d i r -
ector, capable. I fear that he has turned de Maupas-
sant's d e l i c a t e , s e n s i t i v e , atmospheric l i t t l e s t o r y
i n t o a s l i c k l y suggestive t a l e about the sex l i v e s o f
the roues of a kind o f Clochmerle-sur-Mer (and how d u l l
i t was - Oh f o r some r e a l l y s i n f u l doings on the films!)
It may be box o f f i c e , but I'm s i c k of f i l m s which, i n
the worst American t r a d i t i o n , promise to be pornographic
and then f a i l to d e l i v e r the goods. The l a s t s t o r y I
found f a r the best; anybody who has been i n love long
enough to know the queer growth of a deep intimacy, of a
kind of compassion, which i s s t i l l there i n the midst o f
the worst rows, w i l l recognize the r e a l t h i n g and w i l l
be glad because i t too i s a l l too r a r e l y seen i n the
cinema. See the f i l m f o r t h i s alone, although the f i r s t
episode too i s worth n o t i c e .
In a l l , t h e f i l m i s not as good a s "La Ronde". Per-
haps i t i s Max Ophuls' a t t i t u d e to sex which i s the

Statement Issued to FELIX a f t e r the Union Council meeting
held last night.
UNION EXPANSION
History; Plans for two extra stories on present building
were drawn up i n 1927 as desirable accommodation for the
student population of that date. This was reviewed i n 1950
by the student Presidents i n the l i g h t of a population of
1500. YJhem. the Govt, announced t h e i r approval of a new •
expansion we were asked to approve plans. We sent to the
Rector & Governing body a report stating: ihqt tha plans
were t o t a l l y inadequate for the f i n a l population; that for
what w i l l be i n e n e c t tne nation's Technological Univers
i t y there should be f u l l & comfortable club f a c i l i t i e s ,
together with h a l l s for meetings, concerts and the l i k e ,
and WITH A DESIRABLE MINIMUM OF 1000 IN HALLS OF RESIDENCE
(capitals inserted by FELIX).Alterations to the 1950 plans
were necessary to provide interim accommodation.
The case was stated to the Governing Body on Friday 13th
March & a reply wa.s received that the building would be
enlarged, but that t h i s v;ould not prejudice i n any way the
larger & adequate plan which would be gived a l l practicable
p r i o r i t y i n r e l a t i o n to the general plans to be produced
for the expansion of the college.
Plani Council decided to obtain a large scale map of a
suitable s i t e ft produce with the aid of an architect pinna
and models of the Union as we wish to see i t .

and a demonstration by a national champion.
U N P E T I T R A C Q U E T
on the Underground. I t i s not a habit p e c u l i a r t o
those of a p a r t i c u l a r l y S o c i a l turn of mind, nor t o
the e s p e c i a l l y observant. I t i s i n f a c t common t o
a l l those who, f o r various reasons have nothing to read
or smoke, and don't f e e l i n c l i n e d to sleep. Which
u s u a l l y f i t s me.
That i s the paragraph which i n essay plans i s c a l -
led I n t r o d u c t i o n , and i s j u s t a verbose way of i n t r o -
ducing the f a c t that I too watch people. Not very much
watching i s necessary to enable one t o c l a s s i f y passen-
gers i n t o Types, and to gauge t h e i r incomes w i t h i n ± £100;
the whole t h i n g r e a l l y becomes a bore unless one s t a r t s
applying, some imagination. I t i s quite easy to guess
whether one's v i c t i m i s married, or what i s contained i n
a t o o l bag or b r i e f - c a s e o r s u i t c a s e ; moderately easy
to guess what a C. & A. c a r r i e r conceals; but what o f
brown paper p a r c e l s ?
Observe how that second paragraph b r i n g s me round
to the main subject of my t h e s i s . Brown paper p a r c e l s
know no b a r r i e r s at a l l ; n e i t h e r o f country or creed
nor c l a s s . A remarkable property i s t h e i r i n d i s t i n g u i s h -
a b i l i t y ; thus i f they were a l l jumbled up on the f l o o r
of the c a r r i a g e i t would not be p o s s i b l e t o estimate
t h e i r q u a l i t y and p r i c e and decide on t h e i r owners on a
c l a s s b a s i s a s i t would be with shoes or hats. T h e i r
other remarkable property i s the mesmeric e f f e c t they
have on t h e i r owners. A brown paper p a r c e l i s placed
r e v e r e n t l y between the f e e t , or r e s t s i n the l a p with
i t s owner's hands g e n t l y , yet s l i g h t l y a r r o g a n t l y
clasped over i t . I t i s not put behind the l e g s , as i s
a b r i e f - c a s e , or l e f t by the door, as i s a l a r g e r case,
nor i s i t slung onto the luggage rack, l i k e any o l d
umbrella.
What do they c o n t a i n , these mysterious packages?
This workman's i s neat, but c l u m s i l y t i e d - has he
s t o l e n some t o o l s from the workshop to t r y and make ends
meet at home, where h i s w i f e , a n e u r o t i c creature lashes
out money on frozen vegetables and quarter-pounds o f
r e a l ham, impervious to mentions of economy i n the house-j
hold? The s o f t , k i n d , w e a r i l y resigned l o o k about h i s
eyes suggests he i s a dreamer, which i s confirmed by the
h a l f grime-hidden yet undefeated s e n s i t i v e n e s s of h i s
f i n g e r s as they worry that knot . . . . that knot; that
knot symbolical of the bond between htm and h i s w i f e .
It i s a bond which he i s l o a t h to cut. He knows that
a cut i s h i s only way to escape; and he knows that he
has not the .hardness i n him to cut i t . And the c h i l -
dren? How could he leave them with Her, knowing as be
does that they l i v e only f o r ten to s i x to come round
and b r i n g Dad home. No, t h i s i s the only way out. He
s t a r t e d two months ago, when he got some taps out, and
sold them to an e v e r - s o - s l i g h t l y shady plumber f r i e n d ,
and t n i s i s the secona l o t . He kjtiuws tnat Jim down tne
road i s i n the trade and would give him h a l f p r i c e and
no questions asked; but where i s i t a l l going to end?
Baker S t r e e t , t h a t ' s where I get out, and my dream
has to stop. But you see hoV i t works, and even i f you
haven't been t e r r i b l y i n t e r e s t e d i n my pet hobby or my
t i n y s t o r y , you won't be able to help t h i n k i n g about i t
when you next see someone on the t r a i n with a brown paper
p a r c e l . Y o u ' l l t h i n k up a l i t t l e s t o r y , probably
poignant and y o u ' l l wonder i f perhaps i t i s t h e i r f i r s t
set of poems, even now being c a r r i e d p r e c i o u s l y to a
p u b l i s h e r who w i l l probably r e j e c t them; but there I
go again. I know though that you w i l l imagine, and
t h a t ' s j u s t what I want you to do. This paragraph by
the way i s what they u s u a l l y c a l l Conclusion, which means
The End..
