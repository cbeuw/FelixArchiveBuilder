Second- ry "to ycur elation " t sudden we" 1th you m y when
collecting- your cheque at the Registry e- ch t e r n , r i v e a
thrjught to the people on the other side .of the counter.
They are part of the administration, the people occupying
the eastern part of the Beit b u i l d i n g who direct the
smooth running of the college. Since he's one of our
administrators who more closely effects you, Mr. O.K.
McDowall, the occupant of one of the small offices i n
t h i s block, i s today's subject for P r o f i l e . He i s the
man who does the backroom v/ork of finding speakers for
your edification i n General Studies Lectures.
Like most of us, Mr. -LcDowall has been connected
with education most of his l i f e ; the difference i s he
likes i t . His father was a schoolmaster at Eton, where
he was a c l a s s i c a l s p e c i a l i s t , which means that he could
translate the school motto (slip.de of a notorious I.C.
president). From then to B a l l i o l where he led the
noriaal undergrad's l i f e , which means that a l l the i n c i d -
ents you'd be interested i n are unprintable.
Af*ter attaining the rare d i s t i n c t i o n of a 4th
olase i n Modern Greats he spent three years with Lever
Bros, soo.pboiling and clerking i n Market Research.
This period contained h i s g r e t e s t concentration on
"embarrassing moments." "Have you had your free packet
of Stork margarine, Madam? Do you use i t as a substitute
for butter i n cokes?" As commercial t r a v e l l e r he con-
vincingly displayed the superiority of P e r s i l ; he can
t e l l you why i t washes whiter.' During t h i s time he had a
'harem' of €C g i r l s i n Birmingham - not polygamy though,
merely a P e r s i l education ca.'-raairn.
a v i s i t to Germany a i s i l l u s i o n e d him about National
Socialism, a f t e r which he was for a period acting unoffic-
i a l unpaid sub-editor of 'The Times'. Six years as a
teacher of Modern languages i n two different schools
brought him to the War and the conclusion that a school-
master's l i f e i s too narrow. In the best undistinguished
fashion he slowly rose to rank of Major at which he was
demobbed to spend three interesting years i n helping to
:
reorganise German education being i n charge of the
Teachers' Training Colleges of a Region. Serving as
chairman on a committee of German Education Officers he
took great delight i n curbing the loquacity of each
speaker to a f i v e minutes allowance, loudly ringing a b e l l
when time was up. This job was essentially transient and
back i n England he was almost 'on the dole', but by now he
was used to relying on himself, s.nd spells as L.C.C. clerk
reporter of The Times Educational Supplement and teacher
of English to foreigners only served to f i l l a view already
of considerable breadth. This brings us to h i s appoint-
ment as Administrative Secretary at I.C.three years ago;
while recently he has donned a g r a t i f y i n g mantle with an
odious t i t l e : he i s now Touchstone Secretary.
Mr. McDowell hae the easy unselfconscious assurance
which i s the e s s e n t i a l product of our public school
system. His wife, who teaches French to Society bea.uties,
says that he always goes "where angels fear to tread".
This doesn't mean that he's one of the fools who rush, but
gives a. picture of h i s naturu: a l i t t l e impetuous a.nd over-
confident but quick to learn by his own mistakes. H i s
aim with General Studies Lectures i s that they should be
always interesting - he himself i s always interested.
And then as part of h i s interest i s S o c i a l Welfare.
Taking part i n the Allotments for the Unemployed scheme i n
South Wales during the depression he corrected hie
erroneous impression of the characters of the recalcitrent
" i n e r s , and at Oxford he organised a party of undergrade
to help i n r e l i e f work for the Rhine floods. A Second
V i o l i n i n 1.0.Orchestra-he i s also fond c f music and he
reads widely i n severe.1 languages; he even reads Science
for laymen but doesn't understand Hogben.' F i r s t year
chemists (and those who didn't -ass f i r s t time!' know him
as t h e i r science German teacher.
Fascinated by h i s work at I.C. which includes public
relations , organising Commemoration Day and Touchstone
as well as General Studies, he i s keenly aware of the
higher demand i n industry f o r the engineer and s c i e n t i s t
with l i b e r a l interests. He thinks i t w i l l be a pity i f
1.0. develops into a University for Technology alone,
believing n.lso that i f I.C. became completely residential
i t would be the best thing that could hrwpon. ; i r .
IcDov.w.ll cherishes hopes of greater f a c i l i t i e s for li'm-ral
studies for J,a. students i n the fvture based on t h e i r
f r e e w i l l and interest and not bound to a rigorous
curriculum.

ANALYSIS. Anybody with more than 3 b's i s a raving ex-
t r o v e r t and should 6tart t a k i n g bromides. Those with
more than } a's are s i l e n t introverts, probably secret
s o c i a l i s t s p l o t t i n g major r e v o l u t i o n s . Any with more
than 3 c's are too average t o be o f interest to any ex-
cept the manufacturers of those many products which
appeal t o the average man. Those with more than three
of two types (e.g. 4 a's and h c's) s u f f e r from schizo-
phrenia, and w i l l probably be o f inestimable value to
