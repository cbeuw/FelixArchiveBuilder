Rent Strike Continues
at Reading
14 Students t o be disciplined
Despite set backs the rent strike still
continues at Reading. Although every-
body paid their hall fees for last term,
about 1,400 are withholding rent for the
summer term.
T w o weeks ago the authorities at
Reading wrote to the parents of a l l stu-
dents w h o had not paid last term's hail
fees. T h e letter that ithey sent threatened
the parents with legal action if the
money owing to the University was not
paid promptly. Since that letter was sent
all the money owing from last term has
been paid. In protest against the U n i -
versity's action, which the President of
the Union, M a r k C a n n , described as
moral blackmail, a n occupation was
started. However it was discontinued o n
the first evening after the V i c e Chancel-
lor had entered the occupied building
with others, to see if any of the people
taking part could be identified. Four-
teen people were identified a n d internal
disciplinary action is to be taken against
them. T h e V i c e Chancellor himself is
to be judge, prosecutor and jury.
The students at Reading are trying to
delay the disciplinary hearings until
after exams have finished o n 12 June.
They are writing t o the secretary of
the disciplinary committee saying that
the V i c e Chancellor is too deeply i n -
volved and committed on one side to be
an impartial judge.
University regulations forbid a staff
member with knowledge of an incident
leading to disciplinary action to sit o n
a. disciplinary committee. T h e students'
union believes that the same should
apply to the V i c e Chancellor. They feel
that someone else should b e appointed.
If they are successful i n delaying the
hearings they hope to hold a national
rally i n Reading soon after 12 June.
They are sending out notices of this to
a'.l student unions.
Art Colleges
Campaign
The Spring Bank Holiday weekend
saw action by art college students, pro-
testing at Government plans for art edu-
cation. The art students are opposed to
the Delaney Report, and to the raising
of the entry requirement for the Dip-
loma in A r t and Design to two A levels.
The Delaney Report, produced by the
local authority pooling committee,
recommends a worsening of staff, stu-
dent ratios of, i n some cases, 50 per
cent. A cut of this size threatens both
students and staff i n art colleges. It
particularly threatens part time teaching
staff at art colleges. Artists often depend
on part time teaching. It is frequently
the only way they can eat and practice
their art at the same time.
T o draw public attention to their
case that it is not relevant for art col-
leges to insist that students have two A
levels and that the Delaney Report
should not be implemented, various ac-
tivities were planned and carried out a l l
over the country.
Students at Harrow School of A r t
made a sculpture out of scrap metal
outside the Harrow civic centre. A t
Chelsea College of A r t and at Maidstone
students engaged in a n a l l night work-
in. Petitions were delivered to local a u -
thorities by all manner of means, includ-
ing effigies of M r . Heath and 60 foot
dragons at Wolverhampton Polytechnic.
Portsmouth Polytechnic performed
st'-eet theatre in the town's shopping
c :ntre. Where students did not use paper
as a base for their protest they painted
on the pavements.
Derby College of A r t held a teach-in
on 9 June and the Artists' Union plans
to hold a conference here at Imperial
College on 23 June, preceded by a
demonstration from Hyde Park Corner.
London art college students are hoping
to be able to take a coffin into the
National Gallery this Friday as a fur-
ther example of their feelings about the
Delaney Report and the two A level re-
quirement for the D i p A D .
Maidstone College of
Art Exhibition
F r o m 19 June to 1 July the walls and
floors of the Institute of Contemporary
A r t will be given over to the work of
students at Maidstone College of A r t .
The I C A believes that the exhibition of
painting and sculpture will show the i m -
mense diversity of the work going on at
Maidstone. It will stress forcibly that a
policy which includes drastic cuts i n
staff c a n only result i n loss of quality
and invention. Maidstone is one of the
colleges which would suffer badly from
the Delaney recommendations. T h e I C A
hopes that the exhibition will be seen as
a fine example of what can be achieved,
and hopes that the D E S will think again
before making 'further cuts i n teaching
staff.
Alternative Education
at Garnett College
Students at Garnett College, dissatis-
field with the w a y i n which they are
taught, took over the college for a day
on 7 June. Garnett trains students to be
teachers i n Colleges of Further Educa-
tion and a Garnett student described the
college as "one of the more normally
apathetic colleges of education". A pro-
gramme of alternative lectures has been
devised covering such topics as free-
schooling, alternative systems of educa-
tion and course content. A s well as lec-
tures a n d seminars practical work-
shops will be running throughout the
day. Departments of the college will be
opening up to allow students to try their
hands at things which are normally not
included i n their course. There will be
opportunities for scientists to attend a
music workshop and for musicians to
turn lathes.
More news from Garnett is that Buzz,
the student newspaper, is going to merge
with the Roehampton Village Voice, a
local community paper, on 1 June. The
union has approved the move. Buzz is
taking a four page spread a n d paying
for its production. This merger should
help to integrate the students more
closely into the community and involve
the local community more closely with
the students. This is thought to be the
first time that a community paper has
merged with a student paper.
Invitations to South
Africa and Rhodesia
not to be withdrawn
About 300 students demonstrated i n
Edinburgh o n Monday i n protest against
the attendance of delegates from South
A f r i c a and Rhodesia at the congress o f
the Association of Commonwealth U n i -
versities. .The demonstration was timed
to coincide with a meeting of the court
of governors of Edinburgh University,
which met to consider its response to
a petition signed by 2,500 people. T h e
petition asked for the invitations to
South African and Rhodesian Univer-
sities to be withdrawn. A t the end of
the meeting the court anounced that
they were not withdrawing their invita-
tions.
The Edinburgh students say that if
the invitations are not to be withdrawn
the A C U should find somewhere else to
hold their congress. Speakers, including
Digby Jacks, President of N U S , ad-
dressed the protesters.
No more Sabbaticals
A working party of the Governors at
the C i t y of Leicester College of E d u c a -
tion have refused to recommend the ap-
pointment of a full time Deputy Presi-
dent. Three Union General Meetings
had taken the decision to elect a second
sabbatical officer and a n Extraordinary
U n i o n Meeting last week expressed its
disgust at the Governors' decision. A
motion passed by an overwhelming m a -
jority stated:
" T h i s U n i o n believes that this de-
cision is completely contrary to the i n -
dependence of the U n i o n as stated i n
the Articles of Government."
The U n i o n has decided to campaign
for a second sabbatical officer and is
hoping to be given five minutes speak-
ing rights on the subject at the N U S
Emergency Conference o n 9 June.
The Council of Senate at Cambridge
have refused to give a sabbatical to any
officers other than the President of the
Union. A meeting of the Cambridge
Student U n i o n last week voted to go
ahead with elections anyway. T h e fin-
ance for another sabbatical officer will
come from an extra 7^p a head o n the
colleges' Cambridge Student U n i o n con-
tribution. Miss M u r r a y , Cambridge
University's next V i c e Chancellor, is
strongly opposed to more than one sab-
batical officer. However, last term o n
the representation committee she
strongly advocated three sabbatical offi-
cers. A petition is being organised ask-
ing h e r to explain her two faced be-
haviour.
Censorship Protest at
Edinburgh
A local trade union branch i n Edin-
burgh has protested to the Edinburgh
University authorities about the exclu-
sion of an article on homosexuality from
the Bulletin, which is the University's
official publication. T h e reason for its
exclusion was stated to be o n the
grounds that it was Hot a "neutral" ex-
position of the subject.
The article was submitted by M i c h a e l
Coulson, a member of the university
staff. A teach-in on homosexuality held
at the University was the reason for the
article. T h e protest has been made by
the Edinburgh branch of the Associa-
tion of University Teachers. They be-
lieve that to decline an article o n the
grounds that i t is not "neutral" is dir-
ectly counter to any idea of intellectual
freedom. T h e A U T branch i n its sub-
mission to the University Constitution
and Structure Committee recommends
that " t h e way i n which the editorial
policy of the Bulletin is determined
should be reviewed."
Protests against
Portugal -
The Duke of Edinburgh, w h o flew
to Portugal on 5 June, was dogged last
week b y demonstrators charging that the
trip marks British approval for Portu-
guese imperialism. The protests are part
of the E n d the Alliance Campaign
launched on 1 M a y by the Committee
for Freedom i n Mozambique, Angola
and Guine. A t the Welsh village of
Bryn Siecyn on 16 M a y about 50 stu-
dents harassed h i m when he arrived to
inspect the oyster beds, and handed h i m
a petition with 350 names protesting at
the Lisbon visit. They also staged a
guerilla theatre piece o n Portuguese op-
pression of its African colonies.
In Scotland the following day he was
picketed at an Edinburgh club and later
at a Glasgow club. A t the Northsea heli-
copter base outside Aberdeen he was
also greeted b y demonstrators. In L o n -
don women's groups took up the picket-
ing at the Chelsea Flower Show.
The E n d the Alliance Campaign also
plans pickets outside the 21 Portuguese
consulates i n Britain o n 16 June, anni-
versary of the alliance. T h e vice presi-
dent of Frelimo (Front for the liberation
of Mozambique) will speak at a meet-
ing i n Central H a l l , Westminster, o n 20
June. A mass demonstration will be
held i n L o n d o n on 16 June when Portu-
guese premier, Marcelo Caetano, starts
an official visit to Britain.
Principal Forbids
NUS Affiliation
The Principal of Kettering Technical
College has refused to allow the stud-
ents' union to affiliate to N U S . Susan
Mitchell, President of the college union,
said: " A t the moment the union gets
£400 a year grant for social functions.
But the Principal, M r . M c K i n e l y , has
threatened to stop this if we join N U S " .
Apparently M r . M c K i n l e y ' s objections
to N U S stem from his belief that N U S
is only concerned with polytechnics and
universities. H e does not believe that
its activities concern technical colleges
or further education colleges.
Presumably M r . M c K i n l e y is not
aware that the focus of the N U S grants
campaign has been on discretionary
awards, which would affect most of his
students. M r . M c K i n l e y said this morn-
ing: " T h e students talked to me about
joining N U S . I told them to give m e
a breakdown of the costs and benefits
and then I would consider i t " . Presum-
ably M r . M c K i n l e y has come to the
conclusion that the costs would out-
weigh the benefits to his students.
Joint Statement by
NUS and the A T C D E
Sabbatical Leave for Union Officers im
Colleges of Education.
A joint statement b y the Association
of Teachers i n Colleges a n d Depart-
ments of Education has just been issued.
The subject i t covers is sabbatical leave
for union officers in Colleges of Educa-
tion. A previous joint statement b y
A T C D E and N U S was agreed i n M a y
1967. A t the time it was written no
president of a student union i n a college
of education had ever been granted sab-
batical leave. T h e first such leave was
granted i n 1967/8 and has become more
common ever since. T h e statement by
the new working party follows the main
principles laid down i n 1967, b u t be-
lieves that it is important to review pro-
cedures i n the light of the last five years*
experience.
In this five years the question has ar-
isen as to whether a college authority
can veto the appointment of a particular
person to a sabbatical office. The state-
ment insists that provided the correct
constitutional procedures have been
followed the college authorities have no
right to interfere with a particular ap-
pointment. T h e student's local authority
and the D E S must b e informed if a
sabbatical position involves an interrup-
tion of a course.
A student officer o n a sabbatical year
must retain the status of a student sub-
ject to the same regulations as other
students. T h e joint working party rec-
ommends that a formal exchange of
letters should take place between the
college and the student officer elect so
that his status is clear and uncontra-
versial. It suggests that the sabbatical
officer should in his own interests main-
tain some contact with his academic
studies, b u t that college authorities
should not lay down "formal academic
commitments as a precondition for
granting sabbatical leave to student offi-
cers".
The statement also mentions the i m -
portance of adequate finance being pro-
vided if the student official is to be able
to carry out his job adequately. It be-
lieves that financial support should be
met from union funds to safeguard i n -
dependence and should at the minimum
be equivalent to the student grant. Both
the college authority a n d the student
union should try to provide the best con-
ditions it possibly can for student union
sabbatical officers. T h e statement con-
cludes that "the contribution which *
good student union president can make
to the relationship between the college
authorities and the student union is
inestimable."
