GAY STUDENTS COME OUT
T h i s article w i l l be read by some w h o are defi-
nitely gay, some w h o are definitely not, and s o m e
w h o aren't sure. 1 can't write in a w a y that speaks
equally to everyone, but I hope that gay people
reading this will put up w i t h m y answering a few
criticisms first before c o m i n g to the main point of
the article.
That word 'gay' puts me off straight away_. Why
can't you be honest and say 'homosexual'.' Or
'queer'?
The w o r d s don't mean the same things. ' Q u e e r ' is
derogatory, as in " y o u ' r e just a load of queers
r e a l l y " . I dont' m i n d using ' h o m o s e x u a l ' , but it has
medical or scientific overtones to it, as in " H o m o -
sexuality in the ten-spined s t i c k l e b a c k " . The thing
about each other. It suggests something y o u c a n
ary thing, that it is an adjective not a noun so that
it describes feelings a n d relationships without put-
ting people into boxes, a n d that it w a s coined by
homosexual people themselves as a w a y of talking
about each other- It suggests something y o u can
enjoy rather than something to worry about.
But it's not ordinary like you say. 'I've never met
a homosexual, and the ones you see sometimes in
the street have very peculiar mannerisms, they're
not ordinary at all. There can't be any to speak of
in I.C.
You've probably met lots of gay people without
realising it. J7ew h o m o s e x u a l m e n choose to talk
like Larry Grayson, a n d y o u probably have no aware-
ness of gay w o m e n at a l l . There are probably as
many gay students in I.C. as anywhere else. S o m e
confident a n d k n o w i n g where to go in London for
pleasure, some sitting alone every evening desper-
ately lonely; some enjoying steady affairs, some
w h o can't a d m i t their feeling to themselves, let
alone to anyone else. S o m e guiltily p u s h i n g them-
selves into affairs w i t h the other sex, some shyly
and quietly in love w i t h their best friends. There's
no distinguishing mark of gay people exept their
sexual a n d emotional need of their o w n sex.
If it's as common as you say, why don't I ever
see it?
Because w e were brought up the same w a y as
everyone, to see homosexual feelings as ridiculous,
inferior, shameful. Although w e find out h o w false
this view is, w e are very aware of h o w prevalent
it is, a n d w e hide our feelings s o as not to be
laughed at a n d rejected. It's very easy to lead a
double life a n d pass straight.
That's only sense. What's the point of your
society then, won't it make you more laughed at?
If I were a homosexual, I'd keep it to myself.
One reason w h y gay people are despised is that
they are secretive. Another thing is that people
are ignorant about what w e are like. A n d w e have
been too afraid to stand up for ourselves. Each of
us has grown up in a w o r l d very hostile to our In-
nermost feelings, a n d it is often with great difficulty
and only after long battling with the guilt induced
in us by parents, school, church a n d the medical
profession that w e come as individuals to accept
and enjoy your homosexuality. S o m e of n o w want
to go further than that, to aot in a w a y that w i l l
make it easier for future generations of gay people
to discover their sexuality, a n d also to challenge
the discrimination to w h i c h w e are still subject.
This is not something w e c a n d o a s i n d i v i d u a l s ;
the opposition of society is too massive a n d daunt-
ing. The point of forming a society such as the
University G a y Students' Society is that a little
mutual support can achieve a great deal. T h e fact
that it exists as a university society like any other
publicises the lack of shame a n d the confidence
in our value as h u m a n beings that otherwise w o u l d
be known only in our private lives. We have been
able to arrange openly p u b l i c i s e d d i s c o s a n d dances
for gay students, a n d to get a G a y Rights resolution
passed at the N . U . S . C o n f e r e n c e — t h i n g s that
w o u l d have been unthinkable a few years back a n d
quite impossible for a n individual to achieve. T h e
university Gaysoc (as it is usually called) is meant
or all gay people in the U n i v e r s i t y — i t doesn't de-
mand individual militancy or . c o m m i t m e n t to a
political point of view, but it is based on the idea
that it is worth doing something openly to support
each other.
You won't make me a homosexual.
I don't want to. But our talks a n d d i s c u s s i o n s
are open to anyone interested in sexual liberation.
To gay readers: The L.S.E., University C o l l e g e
and King's College have their o w n G a y s o c s , a n d
it w o u l d be nice to see I.C. follow. If someone took
the initiative this term by going through the formal
process of setting up an I.C. Gaysoc then there
c o u l d be publicity for it in the Freshers' Fair next
October. I can't pretend it's easy coming out a n d
doing that, but gay people in I.C. are promised the
full support of the University Gaysoc a n d the e n -
couragement of the I.C. U n i o n . I w o u l d suggest that
anyone interested should contact us first.
Information: Gaysoc has meetings (talks or dis-
cussions) every Friday in the University U n i o n , at
7.30 p . m . There is also a dance a n d a party ar-
ranged for later this term. Please write for further
information to T h e Secretary, Gaysoc, U . L . U . , Malet
Street, London, W . C . 1 , or telephone 3 8 8 - 0 0 6 3 .
