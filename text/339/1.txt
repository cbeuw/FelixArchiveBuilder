ON A POINT OF
ORDER, MR. CHAIRMAN
I'M BORED
O L I V E R D O W S O N visits the N U S Emergency Conference on Grants.
The Grants issue is dead, at least until the start of next year. This was the only
message to come out of the N U S Emergency Conference on Grants held at Imper-
ial College in South Kensington on Saturday. Student leaders now have no clue of
what to do next.
The conference was not-
able among N U S confer-
ences for the poor quality
of the speeches, the almost
total lack of organisation,
and the general confusion.
O f the 800 delegates and
observers, less than 400
stayed to witness the end
of the 48-amendment,
seven-hour debate. A n d
the usual cameraderie was
gone, too. Those that did
stay rushed off home as
fast as they could after-
wards.
Suspicions
It was the general feel-
ing before the conference;
indeed, for many weeks
beforehand, that it would
be a complete waste of
time. The suspicions were
well-founded. Every sug-
gestion for new forms of
action — or. indeed, for
any action at all — was
crushed, leaving a sub-
stantive motion that serv-
ed only to reiterate poli-
cy agreed upon at the E x -
eter Easter National Con-
ference.
Campaign
Continues
In brief, the N U S has
now rejected the Govern-
ment's officer as inade-
quate, and have decided
to continue the campaign
in order to attempt to sec-
ure the demands at the
triennial review, which
happens next year.
The N U S has made es-
pecial demands for the
abolition of discretionary
awards, on which no ac-
tion was taken in this
yaer's interim award, and
married women students'
grants. The government
has already promised revi-
sion of married women's
grants next year.
Mass Action
Conference, hardly sur-
prisingly, is convinced
that mass action is the
only way to win a grant
increase, and the motion,
contained this gem under
the heading of 'Campaign
Philosophy.'
'Conference realises
that the foundation of ef-
fective mass action is the
commitment and under-
standing of the student
body. Conference is fully
aware of the magnitude of
the task of building the
campaign from the start
of the academic year.
Conference envisages a
steady escalation of the
campaign during the au-
tumn term as a consci-
ousness of the issues in-
volved is developed with-
in the student movement.
Conference recognises
that building such a firm
base is an essential part
of a campaign that will
have to be sustained
throughout the year."
The only problem
would seem to be that al-
though they are "aware
of the magnitude of the
problem" they have no
way of solving it. Rent
strikes are to continue
and be stepped up where
possible, and this is the
only action now envisag-
ed. One speaker warned
against "turning rent
strikes into a religion"—
but conference did not

National Occupation
Week and other "unspeci-
fied militant action" was
decided against by a
crushing majority.
Boring
But, assuming you
know what's happened
this year. I need hardly
continue. If you've been
reading the student press
this year you will be as
bored with the grants
campaign as conference
was on Saturday.
Come December. Mar-
gale A n n u a l Conference
will be upon us. Then
there should be some de-
cisions and some new
policy. It won't be in the
middle of exams, and de-
legates will be in a con-
ference mood in familiar
surroundings. Until then,
one can hardly expect the
campaign to get off the
ground — and by Decem-
ber (say January before
anything gets going) it will
probably be too late.
Students of London, if
you want a grant increase
for 1974/5, you'd better
lay your faith in the Gov-
ernment. The N U S won't
do much for your cause.

Building
M a n y an old l . C . student will turn in his grave this
summer. From July 21st to 29th the Unin.
Building will house some 300 left wingers discussing
the Marxist view of everything from Economics to A r t
and Design.
The students of the 5th Communist University of
London will have two complementary aims.
Firstly they will work out their criticisms of the pre-
vailing bourgeois thinking which, consciously or uncon-
sciously, underlies most academic teaching of every
subject in the Western world today.
Secondly, they will regard Marxism, not as a dry,
book-learned dogma from the past, but as a living
guide to action in the present day. They will be discuss-
ing and developing M a r x i s m themselves.
Students of the Communist University can attend: 1
Specialist Course from the following: A r t and Design.
Economics, Education History, L a w , Literature, Philos-
ophy, Science and Technology. Sociology or an "Intro-
ductory Course on M a r x i s m . "
Plus 1 General Course from: Marxist Philosophy.
'Marxist Economics, The State and Class struggle, Im-
perialism.
In addition there are lectures on The Marxist A p -
proach to Philosophy and History, The Marxist View
of M a n , British R o a d to Socialism.
The course on Science and Technology should es-
pecially interest I.C. students few of whom will have
heard a Marxist viewpoint on the controversies raging
in the scientific World. T o pick out just a few: "Science
in Advanced capitalist Society" "The Crisis of M a n and
the Environment," "Technology as a F o r m of Social
Control and D o m i n a t i o n " " M o n o d s , " critique of M a x -
i s m " in choice and necessity and "The Non-Neutrality
of Science."
The left in Britain have a very poor record for work-
ing out the theory that underlies their practice. The
A n n u a l Communist University aims to change all that.
