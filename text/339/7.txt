I hope that y o u have enjoyed this year at Imperial
College. I most definitely have done so. I shall be leav-
ing the U n i o n Office for the last time at the end of
July so this treatise w i l l ooze nostalgia for the next
few paragraphs.
Martin's B i t this year has been witty, informative, a
mirror of the U n i o n Bureaucracy and factually accu-
rate. It has reflected the trend i n the College and U n i o n
to return to, perhaps, a more traditional style of life.
M o r e people, for example, are going to Dinner an H a l l
now than during the last few years. T h e interest i n
mascotry is brewing again—I c a n almost see M i k e
once more sitting on its plinth i n the lower lounge. O u r
sporting clubs are thrashing all opposition and bringing
back vast numbers of silver cups.
It is very difficult to pick out one or two events
during the year which are especially worthy of men-
tion. I suppose that the profusion of elections stand
out i n most minds but there have been other things:
every U n i o n Meeting bar two was closed due to i n -
quoracy, the new U n i o n lounge b a r is still not opened,
Piers C o r b y n is still wearing the same pullover that
he had i n m y first year. T h e politics of I.C. U n i o n have
gone full circle. Piers was president of the U n i o n i n
1969, his H o n , Secretary, K e i t h G u y , h a d been Chair-
man of both Ents and the Conservative Society. Next
session with N o r m a n Sayles i n the H o t Seat, shortly to
be vacated by Comrade Lane, we are promised a year
of moderacy; I think Paul Wadsworth must have a few
capitalist leanings--I-ints made £1,000 profit this year
(the money has been spent on a new carpet i n Southside
Upper Lounge).
I have tried to take as much part i n the life of the
College as I could. I realise nobody will believe me
when I say that I have been working so hard for the
U n i o n that I haven't h a d time to find myself a j o b —
but it's true. When M G B leaves I.C., unless something
turns up i n a Micawber-like fashion, he will be un-
employed.
But enough of this—to business. There are one or
two happenings worthy of note.
The Council D & D will take place on Friday, 22nd
June, 1973. Tickets, available from me, are only £2.25
sach which includes a full dinner, sherry, wines and
port, a cabaret and a bar until 3 a.m. The Guest Speak-
er Will be Ian Hogg, Esq., P.C.
Miss L i n d a Creagh, the U n i o n Clerk, is leaving at
the end of term to get married. W e will be making a
small presentation to her to mark her "retirement".
Anyone who wants to contribute should send or bring
his donations to me (cheques made payable to I.C.
Union). t
I a m still interested in buying copies of photographs
of me doing interesting/silly things to show to my grand-
children when I'm rich and famous. This is a serious
notice a n d should not be treated either lightly or with
subtle references to Lords Lambton and Jellicoe.
The I.C. U n i o n Colours List appears elsewhere in
Felix. Ties c a n be purchased from the bookshop. If
anybody c a n think of a suitable substitute for a tie
for a lady please let me know.
I a m informed b y reliable sources that there is a cycle
thief at large i n I.C. Please lock up your cycle when
you leave it at College—you know it makes sense.

VAC INVOLVEMENT
Dear Editor,
We are wondering i f y o u would be so kind as to include
this letter i n your newspaper or magazine, i n order, perhaps,
to ca!tch those wavering beings who have not yet decided
how ito spend their summer v a c ?
! 'The Foreign Legion is dead'. B u t there A R E alternatives
fdr a true hero or heroine Of Modern Adventure. W h y not
come a n d spend your summer w o r k i n g with T h e Cyrenians?—
there are now Cyrenian projects i n many cities a n d towns
throughout England and Scotland.
'The Cyrenians exist to care for uprooted, socially isolated
people who have nowhere to go. In the case of the single
homeless person the most needy are often rejected or repulsed
by Ithe existing facilities; T h e Cyrenians try to reach those
for whom no adequate provision exists, or who refuse to
accept certain kinds of existing help.
i
(They therefore set up projects, w h i c h may differ according
toj ithe local need—which is, perhaps, for a night-shelter i n
Which there is food, overnight accommodation, a n d the offer
of companionship; a second-tier house; or a third-tier, long-
tenm residential house. Cyrenian houses are small a n d i n -
formal, functioning as communities a n d not as hostels, a n d
generally offer no specialisation walth one particular 'problem'
gr|oup o r isex. Ideally, o u r residential communities accommo-
date about 10 residents along w i t h itwo o r ithree workers,
although a shelter w i l l have larger numbers. Worker identifi-
cation is strong—Cyrenian workers live alongside the resi-
dents a n d share the life of Ithe house i n a l l respects, getting
the same pocket money as a man on Social Security would
have. T h e idea of resident participation is also vital—resi-
dents are asked to co-operate i n the r u n n i n g of the house
arid participate i n the weekly house meetings.
Workers normally come for a period of between six a n d
twelve months, b u t we also need people for short-term periods
of between six a n d twelve weeks i n ithe summer.
'pf y o u are interested i n finding out more write to; T h e
Cyrenians. 13 Wi-ncheap, Canterbury, Kent.
Yours sincerely,
A N G E L A C R E E D ,
Administrator.
