Marco's Swedish
Beano
Last week I attended the sixth International Conference of Students of
Technology at the University of Lulea S w e d e n , the northernmost
Institute of Technology in the world. There were a total of 28 delegates
from Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland,
USSR and Sweden. I was the only delegate from the U K .
W e arrived in Lulea o n Monday, M a y 10 for the official opening of the
conference after which we were allocated to students who would be our
hosts for the week. T h e following day saw the start of a hectic
programme that left everyone shattered by the end of the week. W e had
to be at the College at 8:00am most mornings and discussion sessions
normally went o n until 9:30pm.
Trips were organised to a steel factory, a research centre and an iron
ore mine. These visits consisted of a lecture and then a tour. The size of
the ore mine was stunning; we toured 600m below ground in a coach o n
asphalted roads and had lunch in their canteen 500m down. Other trips
were arranged to a conference centre, around the city of Lulea and to a
skiing resort—across the arctic circle. Unfortunately we were too late to
be able to ski as there was not enough snow and we were too early in the
year to be able to see the midnight sun although we were quite close with
only V/2 hours of darkness.
At various points during the day we would split up into groups for
discussions. A t first there was a large amount of information exchange on
how o u r respective education systems worked and our students unions.
W e went o n to discuss technical development with specific reference to
computing and the effects o n society both positive and negative. All
sessions were minuted and a booklet will be produced and forwarded to
participants with a summary of these discussions. At the end of the week
all the delegates put together a Final Document with a statement from
the conference stating that " I N C O S T 82 agreed that it is important that
the technologist takes his or her responsibility for the technology that
they develop. It was also agreed that in these days when development is
more important than ever, it is necessary to put more resources into
technical education and research."
Union Honorary Secretary Marco
Ledwold has just returned from a £200
all expenses paid trip to Sweden on the
Union! He reports his findings.
Since drinking is frowned upon in Sweden the nights were not spent in
bars but in saunas where informal discussion would continue together
with singing sessions, the repertoire ranging from Morning Has Broken
to Four and Twenty Virgins. The week ended with the tenth anniversary
dinner of the university attended by many local celebrities and over 500
students and members of staff.
I enjoyed the conference immensely and made many friends and I was
sorry to have to leave at the e n d of the week. I would strongly
recommend that we continue to participate in I N C O S T which gives
students internationally a chance to meet each other as people and
discuss issues of technological importance, and not as politicians as is the
case with other international student conventions.
