H a m m e r s m i t h Regatta — A p r i l 24
H a v i n g spent a week at Henley in preparation
the squad were ready (?) for competition.
VIII—entered Senior C and Senior B.
After a good race in the semi-final of Senior C
the e i g h t m o v e d a w a y f r o m R e a d i n g
University in the final to win by 3 lengths.
In S e n i o r B the u b i q u i t o u s T i d e w a y
conditions took a hand (the boat filled up
with water) and from being a length up the
eight were rowed down by 2
/ t length by the
Lea R . C . (Rats!).
(Coxless) I V — t h e senior four had a good
race but as in times to come, the steering
proved rather w a y w a r d , and they lost to
eventual winners, Reading U n i v .
Putney A m a t e u r — M a y 1
V I I I — d o u b l e d up again Senior C and Senior
B. This time no mistake.
Senior B was against Westminster School
and the eight pounced on an early mistake
and went away lo win easily.
S e n i o r C — the final was r a t h e r m o r e
d i f f i c u l t against S h i p l a k e C o l l e g e but a
margin of 2
/ 3 length was maintained.
I V — t h i s time coxed, and steering better
the four produced a gutsy row to come
behind to win by ' / 2 length over a fast
Gravesend crew. (Champion!)
Coach Pete Summers showed us all the
way by winning novice sculls (at last!).
Metropolitan — M a y 2
V I I I — n o w at Senior B the eight flushed with
success produced a 'monster' row in the 4-
lane straight final to leave the L e a R C for
dead and a v. fast St. Edwards crew by 2
lengths. The time was not far (1 second) off
Cambridge University's winning Senior A
and elite time.
I V — a g a i n they were coxed but left their
late burst too late and lost.
Ghent (Belgium) — M a y 8 and 9
Following an idea of our boatman we went to
Ghent Internatinal Regatta.
VIII—because of a couple of over-age
elements we had to row senior eights both
days. But the experience of rowing against
crews like the French national squad was v.
beneficial.
The London to Brighton Bike Ride
Saturday 22nd M a y 1982
Leaving C l a p h a m Common at 7.00a.m.
M e e t B e i t A r c h 6 : 3 0 .
I V — o n Saturday they were disqualified
(they decided to 'take a Toby'. O n Sunday
they had a straight final and obviously felt
they hadn't seen enough of the course the day
before, so they explored most of all 5 lanes on
the way down.
T h a m e s Ditton and Putney T o w n —
M a y 15
N o v i c e girls d i d the C o l l e g e p r o u d by
winning their event at Putney T o w n .
M e a n w h i l e back on the farm (Thames
• Ditton).
V I I I — t h e eight doubled up in Senior B
and Senior A . They bit off a bit more than
they could chew (5 races was just too many)
and they lost their two finals in close, fast
races.
I V — t h e S e n i o r A f o u r a g a i n w e r e
w a y w a r d o n s t e e r i n g ( t h i s is g e t t i n g
monotoneous) and could not quite make up
the deficit.
J o h n O ' B r i e n came close in the sculling,
but suffered from some odd steering requests
from the umpire.
Vesta Dashes — M a y 16
I V — J o h n (fat man) U r r y did it again, and
after two attempts the I V were disqualified
by a rather amazing u m p i r i n g decision—"I
was a m a z e d " — J o h n .
Ladies I V — t h e girls looked good for a win
but a bad start left them too much to do over
the sprint course.
V I I I — Senior A eights was entered with a
scratch crew; the I V plus others from the
eight and J . O ' B . The final was so close that it
was called a dead heat and we had to re-row,
the boys made no mistake and came through
off a stormer of a start to win by / 2 length.

Tennis
As man\ of you will know by now, the
Linstead courts arc being resurfaced. The
surface will be tarmac and the nets and posts
will be replaced. It is not expected that the
courts will be rcadv before June 16. Even
t h e n , use w i l l be restricted because the
surface must be allowed to harden.
The men's team have a strong squad of
players to choose from this season, and is now
through to the second round ol the Middlesex
C u p . Special credit must go to the team
superstars C. Langervin. R. Daoud and G .
Pike.
It is hoped that a men's open tournament
may be arranged for the end of term. Anyone
i n t e r e s t e d s h o u l d see the t e n n i s c l u b
noticeboard in the Sports Centre.
Cricket
IC vs Inst of Ed
Heigh ho! Never did the cornflakes taste
better, never did the eggs taste fresher or the
bacon crispier in the Bussey household last
Thursday morning. W h y you ask? W e l l when
the chips were down for the I C Cricket team
on that fateful Wednesday afternoon, young
Steve Bussey (he admits to being only 42)
scored two runs off the lost ball to secure
v i c t o r y for I C against some I n s t i t u t e of
Education celebrating afterwards with half a
shandy Steve said " I remember the last time
I scored a run. It was just after the W o r l d
C u p (1966) when I delicately snicked the ball
past the wicket-keeper for single."
After another half a shandy Steve was put
to b e d , w a k i n g n e x t m o r n i n g to r e a d -
headlines in The Sun about his activities with
the Vicar's wife.
The only other notable performance in this
match was Hinmer's bowling like a m a n with
no arms and Eastland being hit for six onto
the m a i n runway at Heathrow.
T e a m : White, Simpkin, Bell, Helsby,
Eastland, Marsden, Bussey, Farmer, Tear,
I Hinmers, Heptinstall.
Score: Institute of Education 125 for 8, I C
126 for.8.
IC vs St. Peters Oxford
ILast Saturday saw another memorable I C
victory against St. Peters College, Oxford.
Initial problems began with most of the I C
team setting off for Cambridge and by the
a p p o i n t e d s t a r t i n g t i m e o n l y f o u r I C
members were present, adjournment to the
local pub was then decided as the best course
of action. Three hours later a crumpled I C
team took to the field. Eastland opened the
bowling with his donkey drops and daisy
cutters accompanied at the other end by that
eloquent colonial Hinmers, bowling like a
m a n e m b a r r a s s e d a b o u t his u n d e r a r m
o d o u r s . F a i r l y s o o n w i t h w i t h s o m e
b e n e v o l e n t u m p i r i n g , St. P e t e r s w e r e
reduced to 22 for 5. It would have been for six
except for that remarkable slip fielder Bell
(who incidentally bears a striking resem-
blance to Henry the H i p p o , that well-known
ballet star), who proved that he was a dab
hand at dropping catches (a quick mention^
for his sponsors, Teflon). Bussey then got the
sixth by bowling a straight ball, but Eastland
made up for this unsporting show by aiming
for Bell at second slip, who not being as
stupid as most of us would have h i m , moved
daintily out of the way of the ball, onto the
skipper's foot, who was not impressed (how
could he have been with that weight on it!?)
Finally we all trooped off with opposition
declaring of 124 for 8.c
As our innings began, it started to rain and
White decided that he did not want to get
wet, so he got out. H e n r y the H i p p o then
went in, scored a few runs, and then retired
w i t h a n o r e x i a n e r v o s a , due to his vast
amount of running between the wickets. Next
out was 'Ooh-aar-me-back' Simpkin and he
was followed by the infamous I C middle
o r d e r collapse, o n l y to be saved by the
coolness of Tear and Water, who turned
certain defeat into definate victory by two
wickets.
Scores: St Peters College, Oxford 124 for 8;
I C 125 for 8.
