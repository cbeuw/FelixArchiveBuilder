Congratulations to the valiant six
members of the Ten Tors team
w h o fought heat, e x h a u s t i o n ,
b l i s t e r s a n d l a c k of w a t e r to
complete the 55 mile course. Well,
five of them completed it, and the
sixth only dropped out at the ninth
tour with the "biggest blister seen
all weekend" according to the
medical post covering his heel. A
pity it was the captain, but that's
how things go.
Many thanks also to the people
w h o h e l p e d at the R a g F e t e ,
especially Fiona, and to those who
a t t e n d e d the S w i m m i n g G a l a
when it finally happened.
D o n ' t forget to start a s k i n g
Chas about the Freshers' Dinner
tickets, Fiona about her wonderful
Rag events, and Karl about taking
his clothes off at barnights and
other unsavoury activities in the
Bar.
Photos and articles will still be
accepted for the handbook, black
and white pictures only please,
especially if they're like the ones
we have of Nick Morton in action.

G r e e t i n g s , m u s i c l o v e r s ! (I
thought that a really corny phrase
w o u l d be a g o o d way to star
because then the quality of the
article can only improve.) Yes, IC
R a d i o is still alive a n d w e l l ,
contrary to a recent Argentine
military communique. There are
e v e n i n g p r o g r a m m e s , w h i c h
include information about enter-
tainment in and around College
(for those who want a break from
revision) also there is the request
p r o g r a m m e , w h e r e y o u t h e
listener can choose the music.
However, Monday sees the return
of the world-famous (well about)
IC Radio Breakfast Show. It
includes music to get you ready
for the day, what's on in College
and lots of other stuff, so tune in
s o m e t i m e b e t w e e n 8:00 a n d
9 : 1 5 a m on M o n d a y . A n o t h e r
programme to watch out for is:
" J a s p e r on S u n d a y — I t ' s what
S u n d a y ' s been m i s s i n g " , w h e n
Jasper plays loads of 'great' album
music almost non-stop on Sunday
afternoons starting at 3:00pm.
Finally, if you thought that
reception of IC Radio was a bit
bad in Southside last term, I hope
that you will be pleased to learn
that during the vac, our trans-
mitter went to transmitter hospi-
tal; after several hours in surgery,
it is now feeling much better and it
is quite a lot easier to listen to IC
Radio on 301m (999kHz) medium
wave. T a ta for now, see you next
, week!
