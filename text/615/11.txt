apologise to those w h o have suffered from my
sudden discovery that I am capable of losing my
temper.
It is in my character to be a peacemaker and a
diplomat which is one reason I stood on a platform
of cooperation with College. The other good reason
is that the more I think about it the more I believe the
only way forward is by cooperation. I often feel
C o l l e g e o f f i c e r s a n d c h a i r m e n of C o l l e g e
committees are misunderstood by students as being
"them" against " u s " . This- is wrong, most of them
have the g o o d of the students at heart. Unfor-
tunately they also have the problem of balancing the
books, and virtually everything comes down to
money in the end. I hope next year's executive will
be tolerant and aware of the problems faced by the
C o l l e g e as a whole and I hope they can maintain
good relationships with the C o l l e g e administration.
After that diatribe above, I must thank the many
people on the " C o l l e g e side", especially J o h n Smith.
A l s o I must thank the Union officers w h o have, in
general, worked hard, especially at the start of the
year, and they have been very good about keeping
me informed of what they are up to. Thanks also to
my political advisers including "The Think Tank",
Chris W e b b and Colin. A big thank-you to people
from a whole range of sources, too numerous to
mention, w h o have kept me entertained over a beer
or two. The more social side of the job has been a
pleasure.
Special thanks to
The '22 C l u b for their continued inspiration.
Philip Nathan for restoring my confidence on two
separate occasions.
Christine Teller for doing a huge amount of work
both before and after Barney's demise. (This is
back-slapping amongst hacks.)
M a r c o for his s o u n d and reliable support.
Ken Weale for continued dedication to the cause
despite problems with Union junior treasurers.
J e n , J o and Pat w h o s e efforts and good nature are
beyond description. I have falien in love with all
three.

Deputy President's Annual Report
Introduction
My claim to write this report is tenuous at the least.
At present I am the acting Deputy President for a
t e r m of t h r e e m o n t h s o n l y a n d o n l y by t h e
agreement of five people at that, but I have been
involved in many aspects of the D P ' s job throughout
t h e y e a r a n d I t h i n k t h e r e s h o u l d b e s o m e
a s s e s s m e n t of the y e a r e v e n if it is g l a r i n g l y
incomplete.
Finance
This has been a hard year financially mainly due to
the loss of earnings from several sources and the
rundown of H o u s e and Finance Committee funds.
This will reflect next year in a further decrease of
flexibility in a l m o s t all areas and I particularly
sympathise with those small clubs and societies
w h o will probably suffer most.
O n e of the areas of finance that has always
worried me is the correlation between the allocation
of large amounts of money and an eloquent or loud
mouth (a past A C C C h a i r m a n being a prime sinner
in this respect) at U F C major claims meetings. Nick
and I initiated a new system earlier this year based
on the setting up of five year plans started by Rae.
W e have replaced major equipment claims by five
year plans in order that our major expenditure can
be assessed in advance. I hope this will remove the
personalities aspect of major claims, though I think
five years is too long a period, two or three years in
advance would be sufficient, and will make the
setting up of plans less daunting for clubs. I hope
that claims will now be assessed more on their
merits. There will still be a fund for unforseen
emergencies so no one will lose out.
House Committee and internal Services
I have been very disappointed at the performance of
these two committees. I have sat on both of them
throughout the year and have felt the meetings to be
a waste of time. T h e low attendance and complete
d i s i n t e r e s t of m e m b e r s a t t e n d i n g the m e e t i n g s
confirms my suspicions that people stand for these
committees in order to add another tag to a list of
committees for their own selfish aims. In the case of
H o u s e Committee the interest of the other ordinary
m e m b e r s in both l o n g a n d s h o r t term i s s u e s
affecting the U n i o n Building seemed non-existant
and even with Internal Services (where apart from
the Exec and P W P , each member is supposedly
responsible for a particular area) attendance and
c o n s t r u c t i v e interest w e r e m i n i m a l , w i t h s o m e
noticable exceptions. This is particularly worrying
since many of the problems this year were in areas
supposedly covered by Internal Services.
Anyway, Nick and I will propose a change in the
structure of both of these committees that I hope to
see through next year. All I can say to people w h o
s t a n d for c o m m i t t e e s w i t h o u t t a k i n g the post
seriously is B E W A R E .
H o u s e Committee has made several major and
controversial purchases this year. We've added a
partition to the Lower Lounge and upgraded the
furnishings, c h a n g e d the key system in the U n i o n
Building, bought a baby grand piano for the Concert
Hall, recarpeted Southside Television L o u n g e and
decorated the Concert Hall dressing rooms. There
have also been many small but important additions
to the furnishings, particularly we've bought several
cupboards though at present I'm having trouble
tracing their whereabouts. The lockers in the G y m
have also been replaced and we've spent all year
trying to buy new typewriters. I'm presently trying to
find out whether we had a redecorating allowance
from C o l l e g e and if so what Barney did with it!
Internal Services has done virtually nothing this
y e a r , t h o u g h w h e t h e r t h e f a u l t l i e s w i t h t h e
committee or the Deputy President is a matter of
conjecture. Internal Services covers areas like the
L i b r a r i e s , B o o k s h o p , B a r s a n d a m u s e m e n t
machines, and more recently the Shop. Despite
pressure from the Committee, no summary of the
state of the S h o p was forthcoming from Barney so
little policy was decided upon. However this is in
hand now.
Union Building, Bookings and Defects
The U n i o n Building is in a sad state of repair, the
rooms are shoddier and cutbacks in the C o l l e g e
redecorating program are definitely showing. G o o d
areas at the moment are the Upper L o u n g e and
Lower Lounge, a particularly bad area is the S C R
which is virtually unfurnished. This room has great
potential as a large committee meetings room and
I'm sure is worth improving.
The booking system has been chaotic with the
competing interests of so many groups and several
particularly troublesome outside bookings. T h e
v i c i o u s c i r c l e of a n i n c r e a s i n g l y u n a t t r a c t i v e
building and a greater need to generate i n c o m e f r o m
external bookings is becoming a major problem.
This is coupled with a lack of meeting and storage
space for own clubs. Fortunately major changes are
in the air!
The defects I have dealt with have been many and
various ranging from the decaying mens toilets
outside the Bar and their effects on the basements
(my thanks to the various men who provide me with
detailed reports of the state of the toilets) to the
d i s t u r b i n g b r e a k - i n s In t h e G y m s t o r e , m o s t
probably from an outside body looking for one of
those bloody mascots.
Amusement Machines
By Easter, the amusement machines were virtually
unusable and had clocked up a deficit of £500. With
the additional cost of getting rid of the infamous
coffee machine, this area of the accounts was
looking dismal. Nick and I negotiated a contract, with
a new firm, that is safer for low turnover but less
lucrative for large earnings in an attempt to combat
loss of earnings through break-ins and vandalism
(the c a u s e s B a r n e y a t t r i b u t e d to t h e l o s s of
earnings). T h o u g h it is early days, the machines
seem more successful, there have been no break-ins
and the service we have received has been good.
Southside Shop
This is probably the greatest innovation in the
D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t ' s a r e a s i n c e the j o b b e c a m e
sabbatical, and was a marvellous idea conceived by
Barney and Nick. However practical difficulties and
the neglect of tedious day-to-day aspects s u c h as
reordering have lead to a rather tough first year. T h e
S h o p n o w h a s a p a r t - t i m e m a n a g e r a n d t h e
organisation finally seems to be settling down. This
is the area to which I have devoted the greatest
proportion of my time and I hope to see things on a
firm basis by the end of June, there is still plenty of
scope for development over the next two or three
years.
A S h o p Committee has been formed and I hope to
see an independent rep sitting on this committee
and the rehashed Internal Services. I'd like to thank
those people in C o l l e g e who at times have s e e m e d
more c o n c e r n e d over the fate of the S h o p than the
Union has itself, especially Lina Pelham, R o y H i c k s
and Dave Smith.
College and Union Committees
I h a v e h a d v e r y l i t t l e c o n t a c t w i t h C o l l d g e
committees as Barney and I never d i s c u s s e d them
and Phil has already stepped in here. I'm sure most
students aren't interested anyway.
Similarly, my contact with U n i o n committees that
I didn't a l r e a d y sit o n h a s b e e n m i n i m a l . M y
apologies.
Council
What a waste of time, perhaps when C o u n c i l is
c o m p o s e d of o f f i c e r s w h o feel s o m e s e n s e of
responsibility to the Union and to the students they
serve, C o u n c i l will earn some respect. A first move
in this direction must be to remove s o m e of the
members, the obvious c h o i c e seems to be the Q e p
R e p s w h o w i t h a c o u p l e of e x c e p t i o n s h a v e
contributed nothing this year and seem to me to be
amply represented by the A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer
and the three C C U A A O s . T h e other body I would
like to see removed is P W P .
Odds and Sods
Several areas I've had little contact with:
Transport—this seems fairly stable now and is
running to break even though we are not providing
enough vans to meet all our needs.
Bookshop—this is vastly improved this year. I am
sorry that last year's problems have not resolved
themselves.
Finally
I'd like to thank all those who've supported me in my
unprecedented situation, especially Matthew T o n k s
who has undertaken many practical jobs for me, the
Union staff (heroes), Marco (particularly for his help
with the noticeboards) and finally that drunken
degenerate Nick, the only President under w h o m I
would have considered s u c h a ridiculous propo-
sition (?!).

Honorary Secretary's Annual Report
International Conference of Students of Technology
This year's I N C O S T , the sixth held so far, was
origirfally intended to be held in Poland in Katowice
but unfortunately after the onset of martial law
communication was impossible and I heard nothing
from Poland for months. The Swedes who were to
be the alternative organizers if Poland c o u l d not
host the conference then took on the task A l t h o u g h
having little time they set to the task with great
e n t h u s i a s m s e t t i n g up a s c h e d u l e of w o r k i n g
g r o u p s , t o u r s a n d f u n c t i o n s a n d a m a z i n g l y
obtaining e n o u g h sponsorship from industry to
make the conference free apart from return fare to
the country. At the time of writing the conference
has not yet been held but I shall report on my return
what I am sure will be a most successful and useful
conference which I hope IC will continue to support
by c o n t i n u i n g to s e n d d e l e g a t e s a n d m a y b e
generating interest in other U K universities w h o
have not participated actively in the past.
Elections
i) Sabbatical T h e sabbatical elections this year
were a great source of controversy with confusion
all round over election procedure, interpretation of
the v o t i n g s c h e d u l e a n d m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g of
terminology. Luckily in the end sense prevailed and
people realised that the elections had not been
u n c o n s t i t u t i o n a l l y r u n or b i a s e d to a n y o n e
candidate and were therefore fair and could stand.
The main point of contention was whether or not a
candidate has to pass quota. Our voting schedule
states that if there is only one post then it is not
necessary to pass quota and this is only a level set
w h i c h o n c e p a s s e d , i n d i c a t e s that no f u r t h e r
reallocations need take place.
In one sense it is lucky that this has occurred
because it has resulted in many people taking an
i n t e r e s t in t h e e l e c t i o n s a n d a l s o o u r v o t i n g
schedule possibly with a view to reviewing it. There
have even been suggestions of not using S T V but
u s i n g the first past the post s y s t e m , s u r e l y a
g o d s e n d for future H o n Sees!!
