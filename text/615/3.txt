Council cancelled again!
Last M o n d a y ' s I C U C o u n c i l meeting failed to open due to inquoracy,
as over 50% of the 47 members of C o u n c i l failed to turn up.
T h e meeting was to have discussed several important matters,
including the proposed linen service for Halls, the plan to run an
experiment housing two people in Weeks H a l l rooms and the awarding
of colours.
U n i o n President M r N i c k M o r t o n called the absent members " a
bunch of miserable shits" and said " t h e y ' d better turn up on M o n d a y ,
M a y 24, when we'll try to have another meeting." H e confessed that
some important College committees were meeting this week for w h i c h
C o u n c i l s h o u l d h a v e d e c i d e d U n i o n p o l i c y . H o w e v e r , i n a
meglomaniac outburst he said " I f no other fuckers can be bothered to
turn up then C h r i s t i n e T e l l e r a n d I will make some b i - l a t e r a l
decisions!" This obviously indicates that M r M o r t o n did not wish to
hold informal talks with the twenty C o u n c i l members who did turn up
on M o n d a y or even consult Honorar y Secretary M r M a r c o L e d w o l d .
Next M o n d a y ' s C o u n c i l meeting will also discuss a motion removing
departmental representatives from I C U C o u n c i l and transferring
their duties to C C U academic allairs officers. This motion has been
prompted by the fact that only two dep reps attended last M o n d a y ' s
meeting.
The Southside Brothel
T h e linal conversion of the lounge area of the Southside Bar to
Victorian style should be completed within the next month.
T h i s conversion is being financed by brewery loans and was started
in J a n u a r y . Presently all the seating area needs to be upholstered and
the lighting work has still to be finished.
The wood panelling and flock wallpaper is already completed
although it is hoped to hang some pictures on the walls. However Bar
M a n a g e r M r H a r r y M a g n a y would like the pictures to change on a
two monthly basis.
A l l the work is being done by outside firms and (the lack of) co-
ordination between these, and general administrative delay is being
given as the reason for the extended completion date.
Almost all of the structural work behind the bar has been finished
and is a great improvement on the old real ale bar, w h i c h is adjacent
the V i c t o r i a n bar and is now only used for functions. T h e modifications
have already improved conditions lor bar staff and the quality of the
beer, leading to an increase in turnover.
At present there aie live real ales availabe (one from each brewery
financing the conversion) and it is hoped to have a sixth pump on soon.
In addition to pics and rolls currently available H a r r y , an I C m i n i n g
graduate, intends to stock ploughmans lunches and hot food soon and
also to increase the range of wines and cocktails. Several cocktails,
including some exclusive to Southside, are already available and
include a green variety, Windscale.
There are also ambitious plans to show lilms, more live bands and
perhaps even plays but these are unlikely to materialise before next
October. These would be financed by the Bar Amenities fund which is
partially funded by the profits of video games a n d pool tables
belonging lo the refectories (who run all College bars).
The current alterations do not seem to be causing undue discomfort
lo the patrons, although one customer was heard to say "It's changed
again; it's like a brothel."
Guilds win
Gala
Guilds beat R C S by 111-81 in
the ' i n t e r - C C U s w i m m i n g gala
last M o n d a y . T h e event was held
in the sports centre and a sizeable
c r o w d a t t e n d e d d e s p i t e the
failure of M i n e s to field a team.
R C S won the mens race 52-42
but Guilds easily won the ladies
race and also won the water polo
match to give them a comfortable
victory.
There was also an executive
race which did not count towards
the competition points and this
was w o n by R C S .
Let's get
physical
The third Physics O p e n D a y
which was held last Friday was
a n u n q u a l i f i e d success w i t h
a l m o s t f o u r h u n d r e d s i x t h -
formers attending.
P r o f B u t t e r w o r t h , H e a d of
Department, gave a short wel-
coming speech and D r M e i k l e
gave a short lecture on astro-
nomy.
T h e O p e n D a y was first held
in 1980 and is always organised
by p h y s i c s u n d e r g r a d u a t e s ,
p r i n c i p a l l y the d e p a r t m e n t a l
representative who this year is
M r D o n a l Bradley.
M a r k Smith, currently F E L I X
Editor, organised the event in
1980 and this year gave a short
talk about life at university.
A major part of the O p e n D a y
is a display of first year labora-
tory projects and this year they
included biophysics, computer
simulations of radio-active decay
and R u b i k ' s C u b e , holography
and a study of the time of arrival
o f s t u d e n t s f o r t h e i r e a r l y
morning lectures.
Rag Fete
Sucess
I C U n i o n R a g Fete took place on
S a t u r d a y a f t e r n o o n o n t h e
Queen's L a w n . A b o u t 400 people
a t t e n d e d a n d over £400 was
raised for charity. T h e fete was
o p e n e d by the R e c t o r , L o r d
Flowers.
T h e Queen's T o w e r was open
for those who wanted to pay 30p
to go up it a n d other entertain-
ments included the ritual shaving
of P r e s i d e n t - e l e c t M r S t e v e
Goulder.
A n o t h e r a t t r a c t i o n was the
s o g g y - s p o n g e t h r o w i n g s t a l l
which gave an opportunity for
participants to release their pent-
up frustrations. Finally, L a d y
F l o w e r s a n d I C W i v e s C l u b
offered h o m e - m a d e j a m s a n d
preserves for sale on their stall.
Who gives
a damn
about Mike?
There has been absolutely no
progress in the search for the I C
U n i o n mascot M i k e . In fact there
has been no effort e x p e n d e d
whatsoever.
T h e 1701b micrometer, which
w e n t m i s s i n g f r o m the I C U
Office in the early hours of M a y
6. seems to have been forgotten
a b o u t a l r e a d y . T h e A c t i n g
Deputy President. Miss Christine
Teller has quite rightly left the
matter for the President and H o n
Sec to deal with as they were
r e s p o n s i b l e for l e a v i n g M i k e
unattended in the U n i o n Office.
However, I C U President Nick
M o r t o n told F E L I X " D o you
think anybody really cares about
the thing?"
An apology
F E L I X would like to apologise for a serious omission which occurred in
the M a y 7 issue. Amidst the excitement of the loss of the U n i o n mascot
M i k e , we failed to c a n y a report on the U G M which took place on
Tuesday, M a y 4. However, our on-the-spot reporter N . Willson has
managed to recall the following about this exciting and extremely
important occasion.
About twenty boring farts gatheredfor the non-event of the term, the I'GM in
the (ireat Hall on Tuesday. May 4. Some fat bloke with a moustache, or maybe
the fat slob with the beard, opened the meeting several minutes late. Quorum was
challenged and the fat slob with the beard ignored it. At a second attempt at
challenging quorum the bearded slob tried lo wiggle out of it by demanding to see
the challengers' unioncards. even though one of the challengers (me) was known to
him by sight. Ian House, the other challenger, showed his card. The meeting
closed aflei one minute anil twenty-fire seconds.
T h e I C U A n n u a l General meeting will take place on Tuesday, M a y
25, at 1:00pm in the Great Hall—see you there!
