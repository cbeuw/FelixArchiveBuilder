What's On
Is Nick Morton Insane?
Bumbling mascoteer Nick Morton is showing
his true colours again! O l d peabrain spent
Monday evening screaming about people not
turning up to IC Council, and yet which little
schemes crop up this week? Only the closing
of the Lower Refectory, demolition of the
partition and the sharing of Weeks Hall rooms.
He says that he and the Archangel Teller will
have to make all the decisions that Council
didn't. However, he's known about all these
important items since February and only sees
fit to mention then now, while people are busy
with exams.
Crikey Nick, give us a break! If you were
really bothered about student opinions (which
you obviously aren't) you would have told us
earlier. So shut you fat gob and sit down!
Montpelier St.
Further evidence of Morton's premature senile
decay comes with his haughty I'm not doing
anything for Montpelier St. until they come to
me attitude.
H e was elected to serve student interests
and yet for the second time he is willing to sit
on his backside in the Union Office until
Montpelier St. come crawling to the Mighty
Morton, cap in hand. It's amazing how Morton
m a i n t a i n s that he's r e p r e s e n t i n g s t u d e n t s
considering that he's spent the best part of the
year helping College, to rip-off and deceive
these same students.
But then again, I hear that he does want a
place on the College staff and a wardenship
next year
Annual Reports
T h e A G M on T u e s d a y s h o u l d be a real
wheeze! The annual reports of the great three
are enclosed in this issue and, as you can see,
they are the normal m i s h m a s h of boring
rubbish and half-truths. If you manage to read
them end to end and attend the A G M on
Tuesday I hear you'll get social colours!
VGA
A t Tuesday's A G M the President will award IC
Union General Awards to a lucky few who
(supposedly) have given a great deal for the
Union. H e says that he's had sleepless nights
deciding these, so here's a helping hand:
Nick Morton: you're joking!
Christine Teller: a dead cert (and she'll
get a U G A ) .
Barney M c C a b e : 1,000—1
Marco Ledwold: (Who he?—Ed.)
The Rector and why not? He's given
John Smith them everything else.
Scaramouche: Well, if Christine Teller
gets one and John
Smith doesn't, add 4,
think of a reason why
Nick should give
himself one and you'll
win a haircut from
Mend-a-Bike.
N . Willson: 2—1 (services to litera-
ture).
Bob Holding: 3—1
William Cortazzi: 99—1
J . Martin Taylor: 2,000—1
Competition Time
The winner of last week's competition is one
N . Willson of Physics 2 whose suggestion for
the whereabouts of Mike is:
Martin S. Taylor has it-he's using it to
measure the size of his head!
He wins a Jingles haircut voucher (on the
condition that Martin and I can attend the
shearing and take photos).
This week's competiton: seeing as people
may be doubling up in Weeks Hall, I think it
needs a new name. A Jingles hair cut voucher
for the wittiest suggestion (plus a weekend for
two in Weeks Hall!).

Just over a year ago I described the intriguing
telephone system in the East European town
of Kuratowskigrad. Y o u will remember that
there is no central telephone exchange, and
you can only phone one house from another if
there is an independent underground cable
joining the two houses. N o u n d e r g r o u n d
cables cross, and no cable passes under a
house; each cable serves only the two houses
at its ends.
N o w when I set the puzzle, I mentioned that
a friend w h o lives in the t o w n ' p r o u d l y
informed me that he is connected to six of his
friends, and no one in the town is connected to
less than five others'. This means there must
be at least fourteen houses in the town (see
diagram). But my friend has since written to
point out a slight inaccuracy: while I was right
in saying that no one is connected to less than
five others, I should have said that my friend is
the only p e s o n c o n n e c t e d to e x a c t l y six
others.
So now what is the smallest number of
houses there could be in Kuratowskigrad?
Show your answer is possible by drawing a
possible network of telephone lines.

they have to be easy or no one enters. A n d
