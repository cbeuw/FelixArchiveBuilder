WANKING
IN WEEKS
-OFFICIAL
Senior W a r d e n D r D o n M o n r o
has proposed plans to house two
students in single rooms in Weeks
H a l l , of which he is also W a r d e n ,
next year.
Weeks H a l l is a mixed H a l l
with 64 single rooms and it is
proposed to "double u p " eight of
these. T h e p l a n w i l l i n v o l v e
putting bunk beds in the rooms
and has been put forward as a
means of offering all freshers a
place in residence.
There has been widespread
objections to the idea on the
grounds that the rooms are m u c h
too small.
I C U President M r N i c k M o r -
ton was told oi the scheme several
w e e k s a g o a n d a g r e e d " i n
principle". Neither he nor D r
M o n r o consulted any students. It
was only when a student became
aware ol the scheme and objected
that the U n i o n decided to oppose
i t , a l t h o u g h t h e y c o u l d n o t
formulate policy as C o u n c i l was
inquorate on M o n d a y .
U n i o n W e l f a r e O f f i c e r M r
N i c k Pyne discussed the scheme
at yesterday's Halls S u b - C o m -
mittee meeting, but the outcome
is u n k n o w n at the time ol going
to press.
President-elect Steve G o u l d e r
said " I t ' l l stop on July 1st," while
as an alternative to testing the
s c h e m e o n s t u d e n t s , F E L I X
Editor M r M a r k S m i t h suggested
that D r M o n r o a n d his s u b -
warden test the scheme them-
selves by sharing a room d u r i n g
the summer (hence facilitating
the use of t h e i r fiats for the
S u m m e r L e t t i n g Scheme too).
M o r e details should be avail-
able next week.
REFECTORY TO CLOSE!
A plan to close the Union Lower Refectory and open a pub-style food outlet in the Union
Lower Lounge was revealed by IC Union President Nick Morton late last week. The proposals,
first discussed as long ago as February, include the possibility of demolishing the recently
built partition in the Lower Lounge.
Morton brings house down
Residents of the Montpelier St. Hall have at last gained the
support of the Union President Mr Nick Morton over their
complaints about the current state of the building.

T h e discovery of dry rot in the H a l l has led to extensive repair work,
involving serious noise and dust problems d u r i n g the vital examination
period.
M r M o r t o n was informed over two weeks ago that a group of
residents had written to Student Services complaining about the
current work and the lack of facilities in the H a l l . Some had refused to
pay rent but M r M o r t o n told F ' E L I X that " I ' m going to do abosultely
nothing for them until they come up to the U n i o n Office to see
me—and you can quote me on t h a t ! "
Earlier this week a resident approached the President with a copy of
their letter and he finally agreed to act on their behalf.
W h e n F E L I X visited the b u i l d i n g on Tuesday workmen from the
Phoenix Restoration C o m p a n y showed us the extent of the rot. T h e y
are at present completing work on the kitchens and bathrooms on one
side of the b u i l d i n g up to the second tloor, which have been out of use
•for over a month. W h e n these are in use again they will start on the
same areas in the other side of the H a l l .
T h e process of restoration involves r i p p i n g away plaster and wood,
treating affected surfaces and then replacing these materials. T h i s
results in a certain amount of very unpleasant dust, as well as noise and
inconvenience. D r y rot, we were informed does spread very quickly
and the w o r k m a n said it was necessary to treat it as soon as possible
before many floors and ceilings became unsafe.
T h e proposals originate from the
College Refectory Committee,
chaired by D r R . Schroter a n d
were the subject of e x t e n s i v e
discussions yesterday afternoon
b e t w e e n M r N i c k M o r t o n ,
A c t i n g D P Miss Christine Teller
a n d c o n c e r n e d p a r t i e s i n the
College administration. These no
doubt include Refectory M a n a -
ger V i c t o r M o o n e y , the manager
of the L o w e r R e f e c t o r y a n d
representatives from the Estates
department (who would employ
p e o p l e to k n o c k d o w n t h e
partition w h i c h they employed
people to build last summer!).
T h e closing of the L o w e r Refec-
tory w o u l d , in N i c k M o r t o n ' s
eyes, be favourable, he thinks
that the space can be used by the
LInion for other purposes includ-
ing sports (table tennis, b a d m i n -
ton, etc.) and the usual use for
discos.
T h e old cloakroom at the foot
of the central U n i o n staircase
would be used as a kitchen and a
hole k n o c k e d i n t o the L o w e r
Lounge to act as a serving area.
This would mean that the games
m a c h i n e s w o u l d h a v e t o be
moved a n d , under the current
plan, these would be placed in
the Ents R o o m while Ents would
be moved to the L o w e r Refectory
kitchen.
Efficiency of service under the
new scheme would have to be
very good; a pub style outlet
would have to satisfy the large
number of students who currently
arrive in the L o w e r Refectory
around 12:30pm. N o details of
M r Mooney's plans are k n o w n at
the time of going to press, but it is
c l e a r t h a t t h e m o v e w o u l d
involve substantial problems for
a m a n who cannot adequately
| r u n the present system.
