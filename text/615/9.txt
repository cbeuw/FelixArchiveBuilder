President's Annual Report
University Cuts
The most important issue of the year was probably
the government's massive cutback in university
funding. Although mediated by the University Grants
Committee ( U G C ) , the cuts were clearly government
policy and not a sudden wish to rationalise by the
universities themselves.
T h e cuts will have serious effects on all universi-
ties, including Imperial College, and I tried to convey
the gravity of the situation to the student body. My
success was limited but I C U did send over one hun-
dred letters to M P s and also managed a token pre-
s e n c e o n the m a r c h a n d l o b b y of P a r l i a m e n t
in November. The replies to s o m e of the letters was
encouraging.
T h e action taken by I C U was hardly extensive and
left me wondering how to convince our students
that a m a j o r attack o n the u n i v e r s i t i e s w o u l d
seriously affect their successors, if not themselves.
However, we were only a small part of a massive
national campaign incorporating students, trade
u n i o n i s t s , a c a d e m i c s a n d a d m i n i s t r a t o r s . T h i s
campaign has not s u c c e e d e d in reversing the cuts
but has ensured further cuts are not imposed.
O n a local level, we have seen various attempts to
save money around the College. The c r u n c h here
will c o m e after I have left as the major item of
expenditure in C o l l e g e is salaries. Will voluntary
resignations and retirements be enough, or will
there be compulsor y redundancies? If there are,
perhaps individual students will wake up to the
reality of government education policy. Never mind
l i m i t e d a c c e s s to l i b r a r i e s , or f e w e r p r a c t i c a l
classes, how will students feel when their favourite
lecturer is axed?
Queen Elizabeth College
O n e response to the cuts in L o n d o n has been the
consideration of C o l l e g e mergers. O n e or two may
well c o m e to fruition, talks between Bedford and
Royal Holloway being particularly well advanced.
O n e merger considered was between Imperial
and Q u e e n Elizabeth. The initial talks started in
early November and I reported this to a U G M on
November 10. The meeting nodded their heads and
said nothing. A week later I reported to C o u n c i l that
a working party had been set up to consider the
merger. In that report I stated that I felt nothing
would c o m e of the talks because of a c a d e m i c
opposition. C o u n c i l nodded its collective head and
said very little.
About three weeks later it became clear that the
most likely "area of closer collaboration" was in the
life sciences. Suddenly R S C U and especially the
biologists were up in arms. What was going o n ?
Why hadn't the President told us about all this? I
nodded my head and said very little.
The initial c o n c e r n of our students seemed to be
over the future of the A R C S and the history of R C S
t r a d i t i o n s . E v e n t u a l l y s a n i t y p r e v a i l e d a n d an
emergency U G M decided it s h o u l d be more worried
a b o u t s t a n d a r d s , s t u d e n t n u m b e r s a n d c o u r s e
options within the University. I C U adopted the
policy that if we were forced to live with the cuts, we
should offer the hand of friendship to another
C o l l e g e (albeit under certain conditions). Whether
or not they took up the offer was up to them.
Eventually the offer was not taken up because the
conditions agreed by I C U and a large body of
Imperial academics were too stringent for Q E C . The
academic differences between the two colleges
were too large. A Q E C / K i n g s merger is now being
discussed.
Grant Cuts
Another way of saving money on higher education
is to cut student grants. A 4% rise for next year
together with no changes in the levels at which
parental contributions are calculated is obviously a
cut in real terms.
There seems little anybody can do to persuade a
non-listening government that we are approaching
poverty. The one glimmer of hope has c o m e from
the C h a i r m a n of the House of C o m m o n s Education
Committee, Mr Christopher Price M P . He has shown
an interest in the results of our Cost of Living survey
and I hope S i m o n R o d a n can make an effective
campaign out of this over the next fifteen months. It
is quite obvious that IC students are not going to
campaign by massed demonstrations on the streets,
so it is f o r t u n a t e that I b e l i e v e w e l l - r e a s o n e d
arguments put to M P s are a far more effective
campaigning tactic. Thanks S i m o n and good luck!
The government has shelved the idea of partly
replacing grants with a loan s c h e m e as they would
be unable to get the detailed legislation necessary
through this Parliament. This is g o o d news but may
only be a temporary reprieve as they still believe it is
a good idea. I don't.
Overseas Students
The numbers of overseas students at IC continued
to decline as a result of high fees.
A minor c o n c e s s i o n on this front was that the
government did not increase the fees for overseas
science and engineering students.
A loss for overseas students was that in future
most of them will have to pay fees for hospital
treatment during the first year of their stay in the
UK.
M o s t of t h i s r e p o r t s o far h a s b e e n r a t h e r
depressing. The situation is serious and the morale
of the higher education sector is low. However, it is
not all bad and I C U had a major stroke of luck in the
campaign against "Full C o s t " fees for overseas
students:
Open Door
Thanks to the initiative of Roger Stotesbury two
years ago, I C U was presented with the c h a n c e to
make a T V programme for B B C 2 on the subject of
full cost fees for overseas students.
I w a s q u i t e p l e a s e d w i t h the e n d result; the
programme made its point in a reasoned fashion
without resorting to sensationalist television. The
feedback I have had from C o l l e g e staff, students
and one ex-student agrees it was a well-presented
case. Unfortunately I have only had two letters from
complete strangers. I thought more people would be
interested in further information on the topic (there
is certainly a lot to offer). Still, the audience should
have been around the million mark and if we have
made just a few people more aware of the problem
then we have achieved our aim.
It was certainly quite fun to make the programme
but none of it would have been possible without the
team. Thanks to G o r d o n Quartey, Nick L a m b r o u
and M a r c o for their research, Barney for finding a
superb quote from Henry II! and a very special
thanks to Lawrence Windley who gave up a great
deal of his time to help in research and production.
Some Jolly Bits
Congratulations are due to our University Challenge
team for winning three times to qualify for the
knock-out part of the competition. Regretably, this
report was written before the quarter-final against
St. A n d r e w s was recorded.
I was very pleased that the Rugby C l u b and
F o o t b a l l C l u b both w o n their U n i v e r s i t y C u p
competitions.
It was a pleasure to host the British University
C h e s s C h a m p i o n s h i p a n d a U n i v e r s i t y C h e s s
international in the Union. (All the organisation
brilliantly carried out by Tim Wright.)
Thankfully, these sort of events remain an integral
and important part of student life at IC.
Academic Affairs
Like my predecessor, I believe the Union's work on
the academic front is crucial.
F o r t h e u n d e r g r a d u a t e , w e o b v i o u s l y w a n t
lecturers with the best quality lecturing skills. I hope
training courses will continue to be taken seriously
by probationary lecturers, even as the money for
s u c h c o u r s e s d e c r e a s e s . H o w e v e r , I b e c a m e
c o n c e r n e d with more experienced lecturers. H o w
do we tell them the message is not getting across to
t h e s t u d e n t c o n s u m e r ? T h e a n s w e r w a s t h e
introduction throughout C o l l e g e of questionnaires
on each course. T h e s e have had s o m e s u c c e s s in
physics where lecturers have noted dissatisfaction
with their speed, handwriting or whatever. I hope
the system will work in every department but it is
very much up to the A c a d e m i c Affairs Committee to
ensure it does.
O n the question of student feedback, I was most
impressed by the open discussion of an M S c course
in the geology department I attended. T h e frank
exchange of views was highly constructive. For
small groups this system is ideal and may be worth
consideration in other departments.
Research postgraduates have a very different
problem (close to my heart, this one!). The over-
r u n n i n g of r e s e a r c h t i m e h a s a t t r a c t e d t h e
consideration of staff, students, administrators and
the national press this year. B e c a u s e pressure is
c o m i n g from many quarters, improvements on the
system are being found. Board of Studies at IC
passed proposals to take greater care with selection
of students, to include the progress of a lecturers'
r e s e a r c h s t u d e n t s w h e n r e v i e w i n g a l e c t u r e r ' s
promotion, to limit the number of students per
supervisor and to press for a close planning of the
third year between student and supervisor. T h e s e
changes are steps in the right direction. At Graduate
S t u d i e s C o m m i t t e e , I C U p r e s s e d for c l o s e r
monitoring of a research students progress at the
end of the first year. It is better to leave then than drag
on the problems. Formal monitoring is O K , but most
useful would be a change in attitude. N o stigma
should attach to a research student w h o leaves after
o n e y e a r . T h e c h a n g e f r o m u n d e r g r a d u a t e to
postgraduate is a massive one and it is inevitable
that it will not suit everyone.
I was less pleased with the Board of Studies deci-
sion to limit the writing-up period to 3 months. D o u g
Armstrong and I tried to warn P G s this would
h a p p e n both t h r o u g h the p a g e s of F E L I X a n d
through departmental contacts. Did anybody seem
to care? No. The decision slipped by u n o p p o s e d .
Residence
This subject made me rather unpopular in many
parts.
I w e l c o m e d the College's purchase of a new Hall
in Montpelier Street. I hope (when finances have
eased again) that I C U will continue to adopt the
constructive long-term view that it is right to obtain
more C o l l e g e a c c o m m o d a t i o n .
However, there is no doubt that s u c h purchases
can bring short-term financial problems and these
were obvious this year. T h e price of buying and
converting Montpelier Street c o m b i n e d with high
interest rates and a surprise increase in heating
charges meant the residence account would not
balance for 1981/2. The action taken was to cut
d o w n o n f u r n i s h i n g s a n d r e d e c o r a t i o n s a n d
increase rents. W h e n surveyed, the majority of Hall
residents said they would prefer a rent increase to a
further cutback in furnishings, etc. Reluctantly I
agreed to the rent increase. The oniy other course of
action open to me was to organise a rent strike. This
option was not constructive as eventually future
residents would bear the c o s t — m o n e y would not
suddenly appear from C o l l e g e or anywhere else to
subsidise our rents. Indeed, hidden subsidies from
College will be disappearing over the next few years
w h i c h is g o i n g to m a k e b a l a n c i n g the s t u d e n t
residence account increasingly difficult.
(Incidentally, most of the money lost through the
refectory boycott a few years ago also had to be
r e c l a i m e d f r o m t h e c o n s u m e r . H o w e l s e a r e
boycotts or strikes financed? Sack a lecturer or
two? Are short-term benefits to one year's students
worth the long-term losses to future students?
When will students realise that there is no magical
fund to cover these things?).
So what to the future of residence? The heating
problem will be dealt with within a year as we take
t h e r e s i d e n c e s o f f t h e D e p a r t m e n t of t h e
Environment's heating supply. The decorating and
refurbishment programme must be reinstated. Let
us hope that the money is wisely spent, it has not
always been in the past, e.g. the installation of
double power sockets in s o m e Southside rooms this
year for no apparent reason. There are shabby and
positively unsafe areas and facilities are not up to
t h e s t a n d a r d s r e q u i r e d b y t o d a y ' s s t u d e n t .
Hopefully interest charges will stabilise (Falkland
I s l a n d s p e r m i t t i n g ) , a n d w e h a v e m a d e m a j o r
savings for next year in the removal of the linen
service. The savings will be in the form of n o n -
replacement of retiring cleaners as well as actual
laundry bills. All this means the increase for next
year's rents should be roughly the s a m e as the
increase in the grant.
