concerned, perhaps the answer at present lies in
H e a d T e n a n c i e s where no great capital outlay is
involved. T h i s year Michael Arthur has picked up the
o d d property with one or two major properties in the
p i p e l i n e at p r e s e n t . M i c h a e l a l s o h a s a m o r e
ambitious project for a student village. I would
advise my s u c c e s s o r to follow this idea as it has
great potential.
D o n M o n r o is retiring as Senior Warden and
deserves the Union's thanks for the work he has
done, even if we don't like his style of doing it.
Welfare
Whilst half on the subject of Student Services, all
welfare matters seem to have been handled in
P r i n c e s G a r d e n s . I h a v e h a d v e r y f e w w e l f a r e
problems across my desk this year. I have also had
no complaints about Student Services so I assume
t h e y h a v e s u c c e s s f u l l y h a n d l e d a l l w e l f a r e
problems. Thanks to M i c h a e l and to S u e Telling.
In the wider sense, the U n i o n has been active in
the welfare field. Nick P y n e (with a little help from
me) s u c c e e d e d in getting the installation of security
bolts in Southside. This was a major step forward in
the prevention of rape and possibly theft. Nick also
organised Welare Week. Well organised and badly
attended, his efforts were wasted on IC students. I
h o p e our Welfare C o m m i t t e e can produce a welfare
booklet this year which will be another step forward.
The Health Centre is under financial pressure and
m e t h o d s of m a i n t a i n i n g all f a c i l i t i e s are b e i n g
examined. There have been no complaints to me
about the Health Centre, a pleasant change from
f o u r or five y e a r s a g o . C r e d i t m u s t g o to the
Director, Dr Haines I regret he is moving on to new
pastures.
Morton's Mystery
I thought I w o u l d put this in here to c h e c k how m a n y
people really read the whole report. There is a
s c h e m e of major importance to the U n i o n under
discussion in C o l l e g e . It may c o m e to light during
my term of office or it may be left to next year's
executive.
Bars
I have really enjoyed my job as Bar Committee
C h a i r m a n this year.
With a decline in the drinks industry nationwide,
C o l l e g e bars have held up very well. This is partly
d u e to s e n s i b l e p o l i c y o n p r i c e s i n c l u d i n g an
October discount and to the guest ale s c h e m e . I
hope tjiese policies will continue.
S u c c e s s h a s a l s o b e e n d u e to c h a n g e s in
individual bars.
Over the summer, Barney, the barmen and I
discussed the possible changes to the U n i o n Lower
Lounge. A l l of us set to different aspects of the
c h a n g e s and we ended up with a partition, a new
carpet, hand p u m p s and decent beer. A l l proved
successful and the bar has been o p e n for most of
the year. T h e m u c h maligned partition, " M c C a b e '
Folly", has greatly improved the atmosphere of the
drinking area.
B i g g e r c h a n g e s c a m e in S o u t h s i d e . B r e w e r y
loans were obtained and a great deal of redecoration
was carried out. I believe Southside should be a real
s h o w p i e c e b a r by t h e e n d of t h e y e a r . T h e
surroundings will be very pleasant when all the work
is complete and pictures obtained (and thereby
hangs a tale!). A d d to this g o o d quality beer, bar
snacks, pleasant barmen and o c c a s i o n a l entertain-
ment and the bar should really do well.
M y t h a n k s to R o y a n d t h e r e s t of t h e B a r
Committee. A l s o to everybody else who offered
suggestions for improvements (both big and small)
in the bars. Finally my thanks to the barmen but
e s p e c i a l l y Dirty Harry In S o u t h s i d e . His list of
s u g g e s t i o n s w a s v i r t u a l l y e n d l e s s a n d h i s
e n t h u s i a s m to i m p l e m e n t t h e m w a s ( n o r m a l l y )
equally infinite.
Refectories
The U n i o n started the year with a survey. This
Involved a vast amount of work but all was probably
worthwhile. T h e results were both useful and used.
A new range of sandwiches and salads was put in
t h e B u t t e r y . T h e f e e d b a c k , i n c l u d i n g w r i t t e n
compliments in the suggestions and complaints
box, was all g o o d about the new range.
T h e survey also threw up (!) the fact that simple
matters like the c o o k i n g of vegetables in Southside
a n d t h e S h e r f i e l d m a i n r e f e c t o r y w e r e b e i n g
mishandled. T h e s e complaints were all followed up
by M r M o o n e y and should have led to improve-
ments.
F i n a l l y , t h e s u r v e y b r o u g h t to l i g h t m a n y
complaints about the catering in Linstead. Mark
Gillette and the rest of Linstead Hall Committee
followed these up. A cessation of catering in the Hall
is possible but was not wanted by the majority of
residents. Instead Mark has negotiated a number of
changes in the service, including a cafeteria style
service o n trial this term.
T h e Southside Refectory was moved down a floor
over Easter. This idea c a m e from the Refectory
C o m m i t t e e C h a i r m a n a n d w a s l a r g e l y to s a v e
money. Saving money is important as it will be
reflected in the prices. ICU hopes that the move will
also improve quality by putting the outlet nearer the
kitchens.
T h e Union Refectory has lost a lot of customers
s i n c e I first c a m e to College. G o n e are the days
when there is a queue around three walls of the
room. There are big changes under consideration at
present. The proposal is to close the lower refectory
and use the Lower L o u n g e as a catering outlet. The
style of service will change, probably towards a wyie
bar type service. I think these changes will greatly
improve catering in the Union.
If these changes take place, taking over the Lower
Refectory b e c o m e s an irrelevant issue. However, I
d i d s a y I w o u l d i n v e s t i g a t e this matter in my
manifesto last year. I have spoken to a number of
U n i o n P r e s i d e n t s in other c o l l e g e s about their
c a t e r i n g . I h a v e a l s o s e e n c a t e r i n g a c c o u n t s
prepared by other universities. S o m e of the losses
are spectacular! P W P visited a couple of viable
outlets in L o n d o n but on balance I think it would be
a financial disaster to attempt a takeover. Besides,
the C o l l e g e probably would not allow it.
Finally, the Union should thank Dr Schroter for his
work as Refectory Committee C h a i r m a n over the
last three years. I believe he has always worked with
the interests of the c o n s u m e r at heart, he is acutely
aware of the social role of catering in this C o l l e g e
and he has always been keen to co-operate with the
Union. T h a n k s Bob.
UGMs and Council Meetings
At the time of writing, six out of eight U G M s have
been quorate at one stage. This is an improvement
and I don't care why that is; if we need to discuss
Rag M a g s every meeting then that's fine by me. The
important point is to get people to meetings so they
can see what the Union is all about.
U G M s have often been fun but rarely has a
meeting given me an idea to chase up. Indeed, the
only mandate I recall from a motion was to check up
on our Chancellor's behaviour in Nepal.
Similarly C o u n c i l has given me little to do but
C o u n c i l meetings have had the added drawback of
l a c k of interest by its m e m b e r s . T w o C o u n c i l
meetings to date have ended inquorate. Still, they
h a v e b e e n fun at t i m e s a n d it has often b e e n
amusing to observe political backstabbing from
s o m e members.
Rag
O h dear! I would have liked to be able to report the
e x e c u t i v e t o o k an a c t i v e part in p r o m o t i n g
collections. Regretably my involvement has only
been to negotiate with civil servants at Scotland
Y a r d a n d w i t h v a r i o u s f i n a n c i a l b o f f i n s o v e r
accounts and licences.
R o n y n e M a c D o n k e y and his committee have
w o r k e d very hard to salvage something from the
mess and I hope we will see R a g back on a sound
footing next year.
FELIX
In general F E L I X has been lively but has o n c e or
twice slipped into sensationalism. However, I know
Mark presents stories the way he feels students wish
to read them. Mark's editorials have generally been
w e l c o m e d as constructive criticism and only once
did I feel he was being unfair. O n e regret about
F E L I X was that the layout was exactly the same as
the year before and this may lead people to look
b a c k o n M a r k ' s y e a r a s a n e x t e n s i o n of h i s
predecessor's.
Mark Smith deserves the Union's thanks. He has
w o r k e d h a r d at what is a r g u a b l y the hardest
sabbatical job. I hope it hasn't worn him down too
m u c h !
Personnel
It has been a pleasure to add J o H e w a n i c k a to our
staff. S h e has proved to be tolerant and charming
and has many admirers.
Other personnel matters have involved negoti-
ating wage rises for our staff and keeping them
happy! Fortunately, this has not been too difficult.
Last s u m m e r I was involved with a long series of
w a r d e n s h i p i n t e r v i e w s . T h e s e g e n e r a l l y p r o v e d
i n t e r e s t i n g a n d I t h i n k the right p e o p l e w e r e
a p p o i n t e d . H o w e v e r , b e c a u s e of p e r s o n a l
involvement I cannot claim to have actually enjoyed
most selection procedures.
Barney McCabe
O n e of the most newsworthy events of the year was
B a r n e y ' s r e s i g n a t i o n f r o m the post of D e p u t y
President. This decision was precipitated by a no
confidence vote at C o u n c i l . However, there was
m u c h more behind the decision than just a few
h a c k s g e t t i n g u p s e t . T h e d e c i s i o n w a s o n l y
Barney's. I think the job had ceased to entertain him
and this made him lazy. Barney felt very strongly
that I C U should be more fun and entertainment.
Perhaps he was right but there will always be boring
aspects to the D P ' s job, it cannot all be fun. Barney
was not very good at the boring bits and left one or
two interesting tangles over finance, etc., because
he had not taken the time and care with the boring
bits. Barney's love of entertainment occasionally
made him fun around the officer but at other times his
playing of banjos, etc., was bloody irritating.
Still he was an occasional source of novel ideas
and always loyal to me, M a r c o and the U n i o n and for
that, at least, I thank him.
I must report on three aspects of his job which I
have been involved with either before or after his
resignation.
Finance and Clubs and Societies
W e have spent a lot of money this year. Last year's
officers left us a healthy balance and we have made
great inroads into this. This has been a pleasure as it
has been almost entirely due to new activities within
clubs and societies or completely new clubs. I have
said it before but involvement within clubs and
societies is possibly the most important part of I C U .
With the other officers of the U n i o n , I prepared the
estimates for next year's budget. The problems all
c o m e on the i n c o m e rather than the expenditure
where sub-committee chairmen and C C U Presi-
dents s h o w e d great restraint. At the time of writing, I
am not sure how much the C o l l e g e will allocate us
so the extent of the problems is undetermined.
We have consolidated the five year plans and we
h a v e a very c l e a r p i c t u r e of w h e r e e q u i p m e n t
expenditure is going over the next few years.
Shop
Over the summer, Barney and I independently came
up with the idea of a Union Shop. After talks and
further thoughts it was decided to go into a joint
venture in the Southside S h o p with the refectories.
Estates did the conversion quickly and all was ready
for the start of term.
Teething problems arose from our end in the re-
ordering of stock and the promotion of sports
goods. It was very disappointing that the students
were unaware that we were selling some of the
cheapest goods in L o n d o n .
However, the shop will still make a trading profit
this year and with s o m e work from successive D P s
should make a realistic annual return on the initial
investment.
C e r t a i n l y t h e a p p e a r a n c e of t h e s h o p h a s
improved and the refectories have benefited from
the joint venture.
Games Machines
There were a number of reasons why the U n i o n lost
money this year on our vending operation. Barney's
biggest mistake was that he did not actually realise
this was happening.
However, it won't happen again. Christine Teller
a n d I h a v e n e g o t i a t e d a d e a l w i t h a different
c o m p a n y on which it is virtually impossible for us to
lose out.
Bureaucracy and Fiddly Bits
I have spent a vast amount of time dealing with
enquiries and problems from students and many
other people. These c o m e in the form of telephone
calls, letters or personal visits. It was inevitable that I
would spend a lot of time on s u c h matters and
thankfully they have been varied enough to remain
interesting. A l l these enquiries and problems are
either too routine or too delicate to report here.
T h e C o l l e g e bureaurcracy does often take time to
churn out response but it has not been too bad this
y e a r , e s p e c i a l l y as m a n y s e c t i o n s h a v e b e e n
u n d e r s t a f f e d t h a n k s ( a g a i n ) to U G C c u t s .
Surprisingly, the Union is equally bad and it has
often taken ages to sort out financial or other
matters with club or union offices.
Me
At the end of a very lengthy report, I thought I might
add a few personal comments. I have thoroughly
enjoyed this year. Apart from the month of April, I
have worked extremely hard both in terms of hours
and productivity (but you only have my word for it).
Only occasionally has the job got to me and I
