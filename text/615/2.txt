Dear Mark
I feel it's about time the
events of the South Atlantic-
got a mention in the pages of
F E L I X . M a n y of the more
i g n o r a n t a n d i l l - i n f o r m e d
students around College think
they are only here to get a-
degree so wider political issues
are irrelevant to their self-
contained, insular cocoon of
self delusion and well worn
platitudes. I would like to
point out to those people that
they are living in the real
world and its about time they
grew up and opened their
eyes to this fact; College is an
i d e a l f o r u m for i n t e l l i g e n t
d e b a t e of t h e i m p o r t a n t
political issues which concern
each and every one of us.
Returning to the Falklands,
I fail to see why this anachron-
. i s t i c r e m n a n t of b y g o n e
British Imperialism has to cost
this country thirty odd lives to
d a t e , a n d s e v e r a l b i l l i o n
pounds which could be far
better spent elsewhere, not to
m e n t i o n the lives of three
hundred Argentinians, who
are, after all, only pawns in
the p o w e r s t r a t e g y of a
contemptible fascist regime
g u i l t y of i n n u m e r a b l e v i o -
lations of human rights.
T h e government has, of
course, as with all its policies,
a c t e d h i g h h a n d e d l y a n d
without due consideration of
the consequences, motivated
solely by the desire to reflate
its popularity in the hope of
w i n n i n g the next election.
The decision to send the task
force fits into the predictable
pattern of events one is now
conditioned to expect from
the emotionless zombies who
are clinging to power by any
means they can.
T o them, it seems perfectly
natural to waste ^lObillion
pounds on a ludicrous naval
exercise around the Falkland
Islands rather than spending
it to create employment for
some of the 3m unemployed.
They chose their present
h i g h h a n d e d m i l i t a r i s t i c
course of action, which puts
them in a comparible league
as the A r g e n t i n i a n j u n t a ,
rather than over a sensible
and peaceful solution. The
Islanders should have been
g i v e n the chance of being
evacuated and flown back to
Britain and then sovereignity
immediately handed over to
the islands rightful owners,
the Argentinians, instead of
which the government has
d u g us into an untenable
position w h i c h it is t r y i n g
through its intransigence to
maintain. I would hope that a
m o t i o n i n s u p p o r t of the
A r g e n t i n i a n s c l a i m to the
Falklands will receive support
from all the thinking members
of this College at the next
U G M .

Dear Sir
Last Saturday's R a g Fete
was a great success, and I'd
like to thank everybody who
came along but in particular
the Minesmen who not only
had a good turnout of stalls
(including the peep show!)
but seemed to be the only
students spending money, and
carrying off most of the Raflle
prizes. Cheers lads.
Yours
John ( R S M V P )
P S : T h e p o o r M o g g i e ' s
been on paracetamol all week
and still isn't the better for the
28 passengers she carried.
Dear Mark
Isn't it about time that R a g
changed its charity. For the
three years that I've been
here, the money has always
gone to the National Deaf
C h i l d r e n ' s S o c i e t y . It's a
worthy cause I'm sure, but
there are also many other
worthy charities.
So w h y has the N D C S
received so m u c h support
from Rag? Is it that the R a g
Committee is so busy trying to
stay i n tack a n d suppress
internal squabbling that it
hasn't any time to decide to
whom the money should be
given; or is i t that they are so
unimaginative that they can't
think of another charity.
I'm told that there is a
meeting at which all this is
decided; if so, it's never been
sufficiently advertised. If the
R a g C o m m i t t e e e x p e c t s
p e o p l e to p a r t i c i p a t e i n
collecting and raising money,
then it ought to allow them to
have some say in where it
goes.
Yours sincerely
Graeme Shaw-
PS: O K â€” s a y it's not con-
structive criticism, but I'm
willing to provide suggestions,
if they t e l l me w h e n the
meeting is.
Dear Mark
I have to protest about the
lack of controversy in F E L I X
614. Y o u have left me with
nothing to correct or complain
about. I have nothing against
accurate factual reporting in
principle but I do appreciate
the regular opportunity to
scribe you a note. K i n d l y
ensure this does not happen
again.
Yours
Nick
Obituary
Richard Tate
Richard Tate, a research assistant in the
Department of Computing, was hit and killed
by a train on Wednesday, May 12, at the age of
31.
O n graduating from Brasenose College,
Oxford, where he was awarded an M A in
mathematics, he worked at Cortaulds for
several years before moving to Zambia to join
a mining firm. Returning to England in 1978 he
took an M S c in Computing at IC and was
placed top in his year. H e then worked for
Scicon for a short while before returning to the
Department as a Research Assistant.
Richard possessed considerable musical and
artisitic abilities about which he was almost
embarrassingly modest. As well as singing lead
in the barbershop quartet 'Four to a Bar', well
k n o w n to I C students, he played several
musical instruments well and was a talented
composer and arranger. While in Zambia he
was musical director of a production of Oliver,
a job which involved rearranging the entire
s c o r e to suit the range a n d a b i l i t i e s of
musicians available. His skills as a graphic
artist will be remembered not only by those
who visited his flat or received a Christmas
card from him, but even by anyone who
passed by his office door.
But he will be remembered best for his sense
of humour and friendliness towards everyone.
W h o but Richard would compose and record a
musical jingle for his telephone answering
machine? His openness about his own life
made it easy for his friends to share any of
their problems with him. He will be missed by
everyone he came into contact with.
MST
Richard Tate had shown himself to be a person
of outstanding promise. He had already made
a major contribution to the research work of
the department. For nine months he was a
leading member of the Augusta project team,
work which culminated in papers presented at
a conference at the N P L where Richard's
contribution was widely considered to be the
most outstanding. He had already actively
entered into the planning of a new project
showing great insight and judgement.
H e h a d a l s o d e m o n s t r a t e d a flair for
teaching both in lectures, where his artistic
talents were used to the full, and in supervising
projects. He will be sadly missed by all his
colleagues.
