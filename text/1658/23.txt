This week you go
to an Eating Disorder
Awareness Week
panel discussion. You
raise your hand and
ask whether eating
ass is a disorder. You
promptly get kicked
out.
This week you go
home for the weekend.
Your mum comes to
pick you up from the
bus station. She hugs
you and whispers in
your ear “Nobody
loves you”. Every
fucking time.
This week you’re
excited to play in an
adult ball pit your
friend’s taking you
for your birthday.
Until you realise that
it’s actually a pit of
testicles.
This week you come
into the office to find
someone has left a jar
of ‘virgin’ milk on your
desk. You don’t say
anything but you’re
pretty sure you’ve
been cursed.
This week you watch
The Crown and realise
that lieutenant is
actually pronounced
leftenant. Mind.
Blown.
This week you get crabs
and rush to the hospital
because you’re allergic
to shellfish. You’re also a
complete idiot.
This week you get
drunk and wake up the
next morning in a pile
of balloons. They make
you promise never to
speak of the night of
passion you shared.
This week you can’t
believe you’re being
dragged by your
friend to an adult ball
pit for their birthday.
Until you realise
it’s actually a pit of
testicles.
This week you decide
to be edgy and grow
back your mono-brow.
Before you know it,
your mono-brow has
consumed your entire
head and is making its
way down the rest of
your body.
This week you decide
as a joke to run for ICU
President. On Monday you
realise that you’re running
uncontested. KA-CHING
This week you’re
IC Women’s Hockey.
You said you’d send
headshots in to felix by
Wednesday but you
lied. Why? WHY?
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m writing to you because I’m bored. Nothing in my life
brings me joy anymore. Not my Playstation, nor my Playsta-
tion 2, neither 3, nor 4 and I’m pretty sure that even when
the Playstation 5 comes out and I eventually buy it, it will too
fail to bring me joy. Even my work in Quantum Mechanics
has stopped bringing me joy. Even my afternoon pot noodle
tastes like ashes in my mouth.
OK that last part is a lie. I mean how can a pot of chicken
and mushroom noodles taste like anything other than sweet
sweet ambrosia?
As you might have noticed, I have a flare for the dramatic.
But the fact remains: nothing brings me joy anymore (except
pot noodles). What do I do?
Best,
Bombay Bad Boy
Dear Bombay (if that’s even your real name),
You’ve listed a very particular set of things that
bring you joy. Then again you are a physicist
so what else can one expect.
The way I see it, your ‘love’ for pot noodles has
overshadowed every other pleasure in your
life. I’d like you to try a mental experiment to
assess whether your relationship with pot noo-
dles is healthy or not. Whenever you have to
make a decision, for example choosing x over
y, I want you to also throw into the mix option
pot noodle.
For example, let’s say you’re on a flight and
the flight attendant asks you whether you’d like
the meat or the vegetarian option, I want you
to mentally add the option pot noodle. Like-
wise if you’re going to the cinema and your
friend asks you whether you’d’ like to watch
HOROSCOPES
Arrival or Beauty and the Beast, you add the
third option pot noodle. Or in bed when your
partner asks missionary or doggy style, I want
you to think ‘but what about pot noodle?’
If you find that you’re always going for the pot
noodle option regardless of the scenario, you
might have a problem. Your only option might
be filling an inflatable pool with pot noodle
and submerging yourself in it in an attempt
to oversaturate your brain and get over your
obsession with pot noodle.
This is my professional opinion as a florist.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
