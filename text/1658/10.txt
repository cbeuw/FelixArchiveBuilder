his admiration of the films of
Wong Kar-Wai, and in many
ways Moonlight’s closest rel-
ative is Kar-Wai’s masterpiece
In the Mood for Love. Both
feature characters convey-
ing their inner struggles in
hushed tones, and also revel
in the sheer sensual beauty of
cinema – in Moonlight’s case
this is achieved with James
Laxton’s incredible cine-
matography, which explores
the bewitching effect of
lights: moonlight, neon lights,
streetlights. In Moonlight, like
In the Mood for Love, key
scenes take place in a diner
– this time soundtracked by
Barbara Lewis’ haunting Hello
Stranger rather than Nat
King Cole’s Quizas, Quizas,
Quizas – which acts as a third
space, between private and
public, in which connections
are tentatively tested.
To call Moonlight a ‘univer-
sal film’ is to do it a disservice,
to downplay its ensconcement
in particular cultural contexts,
to sand it down to a bland
message on ‘masculinity’, as
if a single word can contain
the film’s multitudes. It is a film
about pain and love, yes –
although perhaps intimacy is
a better term than love – but
it explores these emotions
through the specific lenses
of growing up gay, black,
and poor. Flattening this out
in pursuit of universality is to
ignore the particular features
of the film’s conception:
Jenkins and McCraney both
grew up in the Liberty Square
housing project; both had
mothers addicted to crack;
both carry the weight of this
experience in their life and
work. Moonlight does not
contain any universal truth
about the nature of life, but
rather particular truths, about
particular lives – it is all the
more powerful for it.

armour for Chiron, one that
leaves him invulnerable, yet
constrained. Just as in the
second act, in which violence
begets violence, Chiron seems
unable to escape the societal
and familial influences that
shape him.
What is striking about
Jenkins’ and McCroney’s
script is the volume of silence
contained delicately within it,
like a delicate skein of words
surrounding a core of emp-
tiness; at times, Moonlight
plays like a silent film, a point
underscored by the scenes in
which the sound cuts out, in
favour of Nichola Britwell’s
haunting, string-heavy score.
The compelling performances
of the three actors playing
the young, teenage, and
adult Chirons – Alex Hibbert,
Ashton Sanders, and Trevonte
Rhodes, respectively – under-
score this idea, all simmering
with intense, quiet physical-
ity. All seem to be judging
each line carefully, deciding
whether breaking through the
isolation is worth the vulnera-
bility it will bring; all too often
they choose to remain silent,
making certain lines all the
more powerful, such as teen-
age Chiron’s heart-breaking
confession that “I cry so much
sometimes I think one day I’m
gonna just turn into drops”.
Hibbot’s performance, which
is the most mute of the three,
is the most compelling; his
presence on the screen is
hypnotic, and his unflinching
gaze completely magnetic.
This wordless perfor-
mance directly contrasts
with Naomi Harris’ role as
Chiron’s mother. We follow
her too, through a journey
from crack-addict to tentative
rehab inpatient, in a narrative
that runs parallel to Chiron’s;
the two are tied together
with shared trauma. By turns
comforting and intimidating,
Harris is able to effortlessly
ricochet between moods in
the blink of an eye; in one
terrifying scene she asks teen-
age Chiron to let her into their
apartment, staring straight
down Jenkins’ lens like a
woman possessed. The fact
that she filmed the entirety
of her scene over only three
days just adds to the tremen-
dous achievement.

Amiraculous
masterpiece
us to examine the patterns
that establish themselves in
people’s lives, and the cycles
that the characters seem
unable to escape.
We first see Little, as he is
known, running from a group
of bullies, Jenkins’ camera
trailing him in a tight, anxie-
ty-inducing close-up. Taking
refuge in an abandoned
flop den, Little comes across
a used syringe – the full
impact of the discovery is
only revealed later, when we
learn that his mother is a drug
addict – and is eventually
found by Juan (Mahershala
Ali), a local drug dealer.
We were first introduced to
Juan at the start of the film,
in a dizzying tracking shot
that immediately establishes
him as a known figure in the
neighbourhood – Liberty City,
Miami – keeping its inhab-
itants supplied with crack
cocaine.
From the off, Jenkins is
interested in challenging our
conventional ideas about how
a drug dealer should act:
Juan and girlfriend Theresa
(Janelle Monaé) take Chiron
under their wings; when
Chiron asks if he is a ‘faggot’,
Juan replies “you can be
gay…but you don’t have to
let anyone call you a faggot”.
Juan takes Little to the beach,
teaching him how to swim in a
scene that is more-than-remi-
niscent of a baptism; Jenkins’
camera bobs up and down
beautifully in the warm Pacific
waters. Chiron will return to
this beach in the next two
acts, first literally, when he
runs into Kevin and desire
spills over into action; and
later only figuratively, as the
two men re-explore that night
in their memories.
But while Juan may want to
provide some kind of father
figure to Chiron, the fact that
he supplies the drugs that
turn Chiron’s mother into a
monster means he will never
be able to – a fact revealed
in a crushing scene at the end
of Act I. This sees the end of
Juan’s role in the film, but he
echoes throughout Moonlight,
with the older Chiron mod-
elling himself on Juan, right
down to the small crown on
his car’s dashboard.
Putting on Juan’s appear-
ance is like a mantle of

of-age of a gay black man is
