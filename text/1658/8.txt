efficient and reduce the burden
on student volunteers in Man-

This is on top of the day-to-day
support we offer CSPs and stu-
dent-led events, such as Green
Week and the City Varsity.
Following EJ’s work, the
Imperial Health Centre will

vulnerable of our members
are less likely to fall through
the cracks or run out of their
medicines. EJ has also worked
closely with College on a grant
bid for bystander intervention
training and Sexual Violence
Liaison Officers, who will coor-
dinate College’s response to
sexual violence and act as a
point of contact for students
and staff. EJ has also reinvig-
orated the Union’s approach
to tackling study stress with
the Under Pressure campaign.
As well as constitutionally
changing the role of Deputy
President (Finance & Services)
to be less administrative and
more strategic, Rachel has
directly overseen the intro-
duction of the new Electronic
Points Of Sale (EPOS), which
will mean faster service for
you at our bars and shops.
Furthermore, in order to make
the Union’s accounts more
accessible, in line with Our
Strategy, Rachel has started
a series of account infograph-
ics to allow students to have
a more direct say in how the
Union is run. Rachel has also
taken the student lead on push-
ing for College, and the Union,
to become leaders in environ-
mental sustainability. Let’s not
forget to mention that by work-
ing with the Islamic Society and
College we managed to refur-
bish the Brothers’ Prayer Room
in Princes Gardens this year.
Finally, we have also launched
Our Strategy 2017-20, which
sets out how Imperial College
Union intends to deliver a
world-leading student expe-
rience. This, like many of the
accomplishments above, could
not have been achieved by just
the OT team, but relied on the
valuable contributions from
permanent members of Union
& College staff, members of
Council and a huge number
of student volunteers – and I
would be remiss to not thank
them for their efforts to improve
the lives of students at Imperial.
However, there is still a lot for
the team to do in order to give
you – our members – the expe-
rience you deserve. In the next
six months we will be relaunch-
ing our new and improved Life
Membership, supporting the
roll-out of the College’s Rent
Guarantor Scheme, improving
the student sport experience,
consulting on the new Well-be-
ing Reps roles, extending the

So as nominations close on
Sunday, you may be thinking
"why should I run to be an
Officer Trustee?" Run to effect
significant change, and run to
improve the student experi-
ence for years to come.

Does this statement hold given
our plummeting economy?
How many working groups
did it take? Did all the hours
in working groups really
reduce the burden on student
volunteers overall? Although
we do back this – good job.
Is this training going to be in
the same vein as the mental
health first aid training that
was supposed to be given
to welfare officers during
handover, which was finally
rolled out towards the end
of second term, with not all
welfare officers being invited
to receive it?
"send nudes"
The Green Week guest burger
isn't even vegan - unless it's
actually golden syrup and not
honey. WHAT IS IT?
What is this? How can we
comment on something we
don't know exists? Are there
going to be puppies?
We have already made our
thoughts on the strategy clear.
That cost £46,000 – but fine.
It would be nice to see a push
for environmentally sustaina-
ble divestment, too.
And it only took seven years.

Thanks, Jennie!

What have the
sabbs actually
been doing?
Nas Andriopoulos explains what the
sabbs have been up to in the first half
of their term in office, while the felix
editorial team fills in the gaps.
The sabbs were warned
about the felix teams's evil
streak but they went ahead
anyway. Kudos.
E
lections are fast-
approaching and
campus will soon
be overwhelmed by
candidates eager for
your votes, but it may
surprise you that February
only marked the halfway
period for the current Officer
Trustees’ (OTs') term of office.
It’s normally around this
time of year that the well-
worn criticism, “the sabbs
don’t do anything”, is trotted
out to play down the coming
elections. Pleasingly, I hav-
en’t heard that phrase very
often this year, either because
I am completely out of touch
or perhaps because this
year’s Officer Trustees have
been getting on with things.
So, what have Emily-Jane
(EJ), Luke, Rachel, James
and I been up to? Well, here
is our highlights reel for the
first half of our term in office.
After years of blood, sweat
and tears (and that was just
me during revision time) the
College have agreed (and
final authorisation has now
happened, whoop) to install
air-conditioning in the Central
Library! This is a huge win for
us students, costing millions of
pounds, which follows years of
lobbying by Officer Trustees
on students’ behalf, and shows
that the College are listening to
us and willing to invest in our
student experience. Whilst on
the subject of infrastructure,
working with College we have
invested £180,000 to sound-
proof and remodel the Jazz
& Rock studio (opening again
next term) so student bands
can rehearse and record
in a purpose-built facility.
In education, Luke has led our
work with Vice-Provost (Edu-
cation) Prof. Simone Buitendijk
to develop a new Learning &
Teaching Strategy that, when
completed, will underpin an
active, technologically-en-
hanced teaching revolution
to future-proof Imperial edu-
cation for the 21st
Century.
Furthermore, heading up the
Academic Rep Network, Luke
has led our response to Col-
lege’s worst National Student
Survey scores in ten years,
coordinating and encouraging
change across departments,
faculties and College. We’ve
done all this to a backdrop
of huge legislative change in
the Higher Education sector,
caused by the introduction of
the Teaching Excellence Frame-
work and the Higher Education
& Research Bill, which has trig-
gered the Union to develop a
new Higher Education Funding
stance. Oh! And we also
scrapped the zero-tolerance
policy for late submission.
Meanwhile, James completed
a major manifesto pledge
when we announced that
funding for Clubs, Societies
and Projects would increase
next year by over £35,000
to £390,000 – the highest
increase in our history. He has
also delivered a CSP Man-
agement Group restructure,
something that has been pain-
fully overdue, which will make
administrating clubs more
Maybe because student
apathy is at its highest point
ever. This is probably not true.
We just felt like we

I hear frosted tips is also a
good look.
Feels like it's been years.
Don't know how much the
Union had to do with this. The
library went rogue.
Yay?
And a felix petition – don't
forget the felix petition.
What does that even mean? Is
this a toothpaste commercial?
What students actually wanted didn't
happen, College shot them down. Students
wanted a 10% penalty for every day of
being late.
From the Union website: "The Union stood by
this as the preferred alternative to zero-toler-
ance in favour of the views of students." "The
new policy will mean that work that is submit-
ted up to 24 hours after the deadline will be
capped at the pass mark, anything submitted
beyond 24 hours will then be zeroed." "The
Union are delighted in achieving one of its
pre-existing objectives by lobbying College
with our most powerful mechanism: the stu-
dent voice!"
Such stunning innovations include the
rebranding of Biomedical Science
to Medical Biosciences. Can't wait
for the rebranding of DPFS to DPSF.

I don't really understand it. I'm
never late. I either do the work or
I don't.
Ah the Jazz and rock saga which started three years ago. When the Union
spent hundreds of thousands in the West Basement redevelopments. But
the construction company completely fucked up and ripped the Union off,
making a practice room which lacked appropriate insulation, which led
to noise complaints from students living above it in Beit, which has led to
another £180,000 going into it. Originally the Jazz and Rock re-redevel-
opment was meant to have been completed by the end of the winter break.
Then it got pushed back to February, then March, now it's not expected to
be complete until next term. Our guess is the Jazz and Rock room will not
be done until 2020.
