Are sweet potato fries really worth it?

costs? Were there difficulties
programming the sweet potato
fries into the new tills? Have
there been significant training
costs to prepare staff for the
onslaught of sweet potato fry
orders? How are kitchen staff
coping with trying to balance
three types of fries?
Johnston tells us everything
is fine and that the tills are
being reprogrammed and fine
tuned constantly anyway. She
did point out the existence of
the new pulled pork pizza
though. “Apparently it’s not
very nice. I watched someone
eat it and they were not
enjoying it.” Good to know.
T
he Union has
launched a new
menu and is now
a proud server
of sweet potato
fries. The new dish
is another addition to the
Union’s growing vegetarian
and vegan options in support
of Go Green Week (yes, sweet
potato fries are vegan, we
asked).
A side of dem sweet potato
fries will set you back £2.50,
70p more than student
favourite curly fries and 20p
more than curly fries WITH
cheese. But is it worth it?
“They’re so good…”, says
vegan Francesca Aras, “but
they’re so expensive.”
We sent in a felix reporter
to evaluate the new menu
addition. We selected Theresa
Davey, who’s been at Imperial
for almost a decade and
knows what’s up. “I’m super
basic, so obviously if sweet
potato fries are an option, I
have to have them. I haven’t
even tried them yet, but I just
know they’re going to be even
better than the curly fries!”
Upon entering FiveSixEight
and looking at the menu,
Davey spots the sweet potato
fries and the pricing. “They’re
slightly more expensive than
curly fries with cheese so I’d
expect them to be better than
the staple option” Davey says.
“On the other hand the price
doesn’t seem to be deterring
anyone because everyone is
ordering them.”
But let’s talk fries.
“They were hot and crispy
which is pleasant. Sweet
potato was well cooked
throughout. Good consistent
layer of batter on all fries.
They definitely need salt
though. They’re very bland.”
Just like the sweet potato
fries, this review should also
be taken with a pinch of salt,
as Davey is not a food critic
and we’ve been informed that
the sweet potato fries aren’t
actually fried in batter.
“They’re almost nicer when
they’ve cooled down a bit and
the batter has solidified into
a separable layer.” To each
their own.
What does the staff think
of the new fries though? We
talked to Sophie Johnston.
“They’re pretty good, but
pretty expensive” says
Johnston. “I feel like we’re
trying to be too fancy. We’re
not h-bar, we’re not a gastro-
pub.” Fact.
But what about logistical

Greens speak up for suspended students
L
ast week we reported
on the suspension
and arrests of several
students from King’s
College London
following their
involvement in a campaign to
persuade KCL to divest from
fossil fuels. Since then, several
members of the Green Party
have written to King’s to show
their support for the students.
After hearing about the
protests online, Siân Berry
AM, a London Assembly
Member for the Green Party,
was approached on Facebook
by one of the students involved.
In response to our email
inquiry, Ms Berry said she
had been “more than happy
to do something” and wrote
to Professor Edward Byrne
AC, the current President and
Principal of King’s. The letter
(which was also posted on
socialmedia)wasco-signedby
elected Green Party members
Caroline Russell AM (and
Islington Councillor), Jean
Lambert MEP, and Councillor
Scott Ainslie. It is hardly
surprising that the Greens
support divestment, which Ms
Berry has advocated for in her
capacity as both Assembly
Member and Councillor for
Camden.
The letter begins by
suggesting the students
involved in the protest merely
wanted a “proper discussion”
regarding the future of fossil
fuels at KCL and that calling the
police was a “very unusual”
step. The letter goes on to
explain that divesting from

fossil fuels (a move reportedly
supported by 96% of KCL
students) would not only help
to reduce climate change, but
could be financially beneficial
for the university as well.
Referring to previous
examples of divestment, the
letter explains that fossil fuels
are fast becoming stranded
assets and investing in
companies reliant on their use
is increasingly risky. Ms Berry
told us that she thought it was
a good idea to put forward
the financial case because this
issue is “not just about ethics
but investing in things that
actually have a future, such
as renewable energy, rather
than fossil fuels”.
The letter concludes by
urging KCL to reconsider their
actions against the students,
imploring them to talk to the
campaigners rather than
punishing them for their part
in an “entirely non-violent and
peaceful protest” on an issue
“of great concern to us all”.
King’s has not yet issued
a response but Ms Berry is
hopeful that they will pursue a
dialoguewiththecampaigners
rather than imposing these
“harsh sanctions”. Academic
careers may depend on it.

What if you’re only a casual
smoker that just partakes in a
little bit of chain smoking after
you’ve had a few? Fear not,
as smoking will be permitted
in Beit Quad on Wednesday
and Friday evenings during
term-time when you have to
pay to get in.
Imperial’s smoking ban has
been branded as an attempt
to fulfil its ”duty of care
to staff and students”. The
driver behind the ban is the
recognition of smoking (and
its passive counterpart) as the

I
t’s official: Imperial will
implement a smoking ban
on all College campuses
and properties starting
the 1st
of August.
The move which has
been in the making for quite
some time now, is a result of
various lengthy consultations
including a ‘referendum’ that
took place earlier last term.
The referendum was meant
to gauge the feelings of the
student body and asked the
question “Should smoking
be allowed on campus?” A
total of 748 students (or 4.5%
of the student population)
participated, with 219 voting
“Yes”, 421 students voting
“No” and a further 108 voting
“No, except for Beit Quad”
The referendum results were
taken to a College Working
Group, which has been
discussing the issue since
January 2016.
The Working Group’s
decision was finalised and
made public earlier this positions”. If confronted with

week, with an announcement
declaring that starting
next August, “all Imperial
campuses and properties will
be smoke-free. This means that
smoking by staff and students
will not be permitted on or
within 20 metres of College
land.”
The ban is expected to be
implemented through the
cooperation of staff and
students “but particularly
staff in management
individuals who refuse to
take their smoking elsewhere,
Imperial students and staff
are encouraged to contact
College. It is unclear what
the role of security will be in
monitoring smoking not only
on campus, but especially
off campus, given that the
South Kensington campus
neighbours extremely busy
public venues such as The
Royal Albert Hall and the
Science Museum. A college
spokesperson however did tell
felix “it will not be principally
the responsibility of security
leading preventable cause of
disease and death in the UK.
Although vaping is already
prohibited inside College
buildings, a gap in health and
tobacco related legislation
means vaping is not included
in the ban, and students and
staff will be allowed to vape
on College Land as long as it
does not break existing rules.
With Imperial trying to fulfil
its ”duty of care to staff and
students” the question arises,
what about its duty to society?
A felix investigation last year
(Issue 1636) uncovered that
£2.3 million was invested
into tobacco companies via
intermediate funds, which is
in direct contradiction with the
smoking ban and “benefit of
society” sentiment prevalent
in the institution’s mission
statement.
It remains unlikely that we
will soon see a divestment
from the tobacco industry in
conjunction to the smoking
ban.

s we’re enter-
ing this year’s
national Eat-
ing Disorder
A w a r e n e s s
Week, which
takes place over the first week
of March in the UK, Imperial
College Union will be hosting
events and launching a social
media campaign in support.
A screening of eating disor-
der documentary THIN will
kick off the events. The crit-
ically acclaimed 2006 doc-
umentary and winner of the
John Grierson Award for best
feature-length documentary at
the London Film Festival, fol-
lows four women with anorex-
ia nervosa, bulimia nervosa
and other eating disorders in
their struggle for recovery.
There will also be a lecture
by eating disorder health spe-
cialist Dr Paul Robinson who’ll
be discussing the benefits of
intensive community treatment
vs inpatient treatment.
This year’s EDAW is themed
around early intervention.
“We’re trying to show the
importance of early interven-
tion,” says Emily-Jane Cram-
phorn, DP Welfare, ”from
THIN which shows the less
than ideal conditions within
many treatment centres, to
Dr Robinson’s lecture which
touches upon the benefits of
community treatment and
risks associated with waiting
to treat patients until they’re
physically unstable”
To raise funds for b-eat ICU
will also be offering tours of
the tunnels and the Queen’s
Tower, doing an online prize
draw and a hummingbird
cake sale. B-eat is a national
eating disorder charity. They
provide support lines and run
support groups, invest money
into research, training and
ment. Only one in five people
with anorexia fully recover but
evidence suggest that early in-
tervention could significantly
improve this”
In conjunction with Sport Im-
perial, ICU will be launching
an online campaign to pro-
mote body positivity. Though
hopefully the campaign will
avoid the sexist undertones
that characterised Sport Im-
perial’s last campaign, which
aimed at encouraging women
to pick up sport by “jumping
away the calories”
