relationship with food, the starving
and the binge-eating, and hopes for a

Week, I would
like to share
my personal
experience and hopefully
help someone out there.
“You are going to get fat.”
”Don’t let yourself go as I did.”
“Remember: a moment on the
lips is a lifetime on the hips”.
These are all expressions I
have been hearing at home
since I was a kid.
Simce school I have always
been chubbier than my friends,
but it was not something that
bothered me till the summer
before arriving at Imperial.
Wanting to be fit for university,
I started running for about an
hour a day and limiting my
portions significantly, which
resulted in eight kilos lost and
compliments from literally
everyone.
In my first year, and due
mainly to my lack of cooking
skills and laziness, all that
weight returned to me and so
did the ‘friendly reminders’
regarding how wide my hips
were getting and how 'curvy' I
was. I was continuously getting
comments from random
\\ For the first time
in ages, I listened
to my body. I ate
till satisfaction and
I ate what I wanted
wihout having to
think about the
"consequences" \\
people about my body and in
all honsesty, feeling objectified
is quite disgusting.
After the Christmas break
of my second year and as
a new year’s resolution, I
made the decision to get
fit for once. I started doing
weight training and tracking
every single bite of food that
went into my mouth. Was that
the solution to my problem?
Nope, that is when my eating
disorder properly started.
I remember checking online
how many calories I was
supposed to eat a day and
believed that just by following
that approach I would get
my dream body, I would feel
great and happiness would
immediately appear in my life.
I was definitely wrong.
At the beginning, I managed
to follow a crazy diet while
excessively exercising but on
the third week I remember
being completely starved. I felt
quite disappointed at myself
and thought I was just lacking
willpower. That weekend I
decided to have the famous
'cheat meal' which turned into
a 'cheat weekend' and then
into binge eating.
This cycle of starvation
Monday to Friday followed
by binging on the weekends,
continued happening all the
way through my third year –
not to forget the hours in the
gym with a calorie-burning
mentality.
My hair was falling out, I
stopped having my period and
that – together with Imperial’s
workload – made third year a
complete nightmare. Another
factor that contributed to the
development of my eating
disorder was the external
pressure I felt to look a certain
way due to all the exercise I
was doing.
Once third year finished, I
decided to start dieting strictly
for the summer season while
simultaneously attending
counselling. I remember going
to my counselling sessions and
always wondering how I got
to that point – I used to be so
happy and full of energy all
the time.
We used to talk about my
degree, my friendships, my
plans for the future and my
family, but exercise and food
were topics that I barely
mentioned even though they
were something that was
taking a lot of space in my life.
On the fourth session and after
a lot of thought I decided to
be open about my relationship
with food and the stress that
this was causing.
After saying that out loud
for the first time, I felt like
something finally clicked
in me, I was ready to stop
making food and exercise
controlling mechanisms in my
life. I started searching online
for articles about binge eating
disorder, spent hours on
\\ I remember going

sessions and
wondering how I got
to that point \\
Youtube watching videos but I
was still quite confused. Some
said binging was just a way
to cope with emotions, others
that it was part of our survival
instinct.
By that time I was six weeks
binge-free, till that Sunday:
another binging episode. That
upcoming week I was meeting
the counsellor again and that
Thursday was honestly one of
the most meaningful days of
my life. I realised in the session
that I forgot what being
satisfied and most importantly
having a balanced life meant.
I remember him mentioning
the expression 'intuitive
eating' and I felt completely
scared about it. For me at
the time there was only black
and white, moderation did not
exist. Suddenly, I realised that
my problem was that I was not
eating enough.
The following morning when
I woke up, for the first time in
ages, I listened to my body.
I ate till satisfaction and I
ate what I wanted to have
without thinking about the
'consequences'. I remember
having for breakfast some
scrambled eggs on toast and
an apple dipped in Nutella.
Something as simple as
having Nutella without binging
the rest of the day or feeling
guilty and embarrassed about
it was a huge step for me, and
ever since the 15th
of August I
have been binge-free. I found
that being open about my
unhealthy relationship with
food was the most important
thing I did and even writing
this has been liberating and
helpful to remind myself how
far I have come.
I can finally say that eating
is not a stressful activity
anymore, that I have found my
passion for lifting again and
that I truly love myself and my
body – including every stretch
mark and every bit of fat and
cellulite.
