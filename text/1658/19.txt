Saad Ahmed talks about how some games really aren’t fun to play and are immensely
challenging, and how that makes them some of the most fun games around
\\ Dark Souls is a
game where you
really need to learn
the right combos
and strategies \\
together they provide more
satisfaction and fun than
Mario Kart could ever hope
to aspire to. It’s kind of like
some BDSM relationship
where feeling the pain is all
part of the pleasure. Instead
of a safe word, you bash your
keyboard and pull out your
hair in frustration.
So what’s the real issue?
Why isn’t everyone enjoying
O
nce upon a
time, games
used to be
hard. Like
really, really
fucking
hard. You had to spend hours
grinding and levelling up,
looking for the right items or
NPCs and learn the technique
needed to progress.
By comparison, the majority
of games these days are rel-
atively easy to play and get
into. Not much skill is required
to play a game of Angry
fun. However, in this large
market of games, there are
those that retread the style of
the early games and are hard
for the sake of fun. Ask any
number of veteran gamers
for a frustrating and difficult
game and you should be
hearing the name Dark Souls
crop up several times.
Dark Souls has earned
itself a reputation due to the
nature of the gameplay. It’s
a game where you can’t just
button mash, where you’ll
die multiple times, not just
because you don’t know how
to best the enemy but also
because killing them depends
on you dying multiple times.
But dying is not forgiving, and
death comes with the loss of a
few items from your inventory.
Dark Souls is a game where
you really need to learn the
right combos and strategies
and have incredible patience
to make it through.
Several other games aside
from Dark Souls share this
complex playstyle. Even a
cute looking indie game like
Story Meat Boy requires
pressing the keyboard at
precisely the right moment
(easier said than done). Does
this difficulty spike diminish
the game’s appeal? Far
from it. Executing the right
commands, finally getting
through an obstacle and
advancing to the next stage:
the awesomeness of dark
souls? It’s because the kind
of playstyle and techniques
needed to really enjoy these
hard games just isn’t compati-
ble with most people, or even
casual gamers.
I’d love to invest over a
hundred hours into a game,
earn the best weapons and
build the muscle memory to
execute the right combos.
But frankly, I have other shit
I need to do. Looking after
myself, attempting to go to
lectures as well as catching up
on animé or the latest marvel
movies. Sometimes people
want to relax and have fun,
as opposed to be punished
for their incompetence, lack
of cat-like reflexes as well
as painstakingly earning
achievements.
As hard and as tiresome as
these games may be, some
people are still able to play
them. And once you really
get to experience their depth
and precision, you realise that
they are damn awesome. The
reason why so many people
love these games is because
they get better each time they
play them, so they’ll progress
further and further. Yeah,
you die a lot. But you’ll know
Stressing out to chill out
why you died, and you learn
from that. And you’ll improve.
Maybe one day, when I have
more time on my hands, I can
see for myself what makes
Dark Souls so captivating for
others. Until then I’ll bang my
head over problem sheets
while daydreaming of the
days when I can bang my
head over the final boss fight.

spawning evolution objects
at random, covering distance
and hitting as many places as
possible becomes the name
of the game. So I got out my
phone mount for my bike,
and started hunting on my
commute. At first I was a bit
wobbly, nearly swerving into
parked cars as I threw my
Poké Balls or spun PokéStops,
but after a few minutes I
D
o you remember
that blissful
moment in
Pokémon Red
when, after
walking around
at a snail’s pace for so
long, you could finally get
your bike in Cerulean City
bike, whether it was when I
was immersed in my Game
Boy, or actually outside in the
real world (where, thanks to
growing up in the country,
a wild animal really did
occasionally appear). Now,
as an adult, I have managed
to combine these two pas-
sions, and finally, more than
seven months after this was
nothing more than an exciting
concept, I have perfected the
Pokémon Go bicycle rig.
I know that our esteemed
Games Editor thinks Pokémon
Go is over (and is lacking a
lot of the bits that made the
original RPGs fun), but the
Gen 2 Pokémon dropped
last week, bringing 80 new
Pokémon and huge changes
(OK, small additions) to the
mechanics of the game (more
berries and evolution items).
Along with the holiday events
that made everyone bored of
novelties like Pikachus wear-
ing Christmas hats (but not six
hour lures, they’re still great),
this has caused a small resur-
gence. Not enough to get
everyone playing again, but
it’s stirred the completionists
like me – who sometimes likes
to catch a few Pidgeys on the
bus while hoping I’ll run into
that Aerodactyl I’m still miss-
ing – back into full catching
mode.
Back in July, I hunted a lot on
my bike, holding my phone in
one hand and steering with
the other, while cycling slow
enough to hatch eggs along
the residential streets of West
London. As well as getting
a very sore steering arm, I
fell off (or more accurately,
fell into stationary objects)
a couple of times before I
got the hang of it, but it did
up my game. Now, with
a nearly full Pokédex and
the existence of an actually
functioning tracker, I can be
more selective about what
I catch, and with Pokéstops
caught three Pikachus while
cycling along Shepherd’s
Bush Green without leaving
the middle lane of traffic
(don’t do that, it’s stupid and
you will get hit by a truck and
killed). You don’t get as much
distance as if you walk or
take the bus (a quarter of the
distance if you’re lucky), you’ll
get to your destination slower
than if you cycle full pelt, but
it is really very fun. Hunting
Pokémon on a bike captures
the essence of the game,
where you can excitedly dash
between locations to get the
Pokémon you need. There’s
nothing like the unbridled
joy of finally hatching that
Togepi while free-wheeling
down High Street Ken, and
getting all of the evolution
sets for common Pokémon is a
breeze.
Safety warning: it is a huge
distraction when cycling, and
you need to keep your wits
about you. You need to be
prepared to cycle past that
Tyranitar that spawned on
Hammersmith roundabout
when you can’t stop safely
(you can always go back
for it!) or leave a Pokémon
hovering uncaught on your
screen for five minutes while
you navigate through a traffic
jam. On balance, I don’t think
it reduces your awareness
much more than listening to
music when you’re cycling
(no matter how leaky those
earphones are, it’s just not
safe), which I do not condone
at all, but if you aren’t very
confident in your ability to not
get too sucked into the game
then you definitely shouldn’t
do it at all.
If you do want to reignite
your love for Pokémon
Go, now is the time. Buy
a handlebar phone mount
(they’re only about a fiver on
Amazon), and embrace your
inner nine-year-old me, excit-
edly speeding down Route 17
picking up all those delicious
hidden items. But maybe don’t
do it at rush hour, drivers in
London are crazy.

No, you probably don’t
because now it’s been a long
time and you were probably
barely born when they were
released. Well, I do, because
I was nine years old when
they came out (in the UK)
and along with all the boys
in my class, was immediately
obsessed.
For me, there was almost
no greater pleasure than
whizzing along the routes of
Kanto on my bike. Maybe it
was the jaunty MIDI keeping
my spirits up, or maybe it was
just the increased efficiency
of starting fights with Bikers,
but it was a wonderful time.
