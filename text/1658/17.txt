Peace, Love,
and Death
Metal | Nos
Amis
Anurag Deshpande
In HBO’s latest
documentary
film we follow
the Eagles of
Death Metal as
they return to
Paris following
the attack on
the Bataclan.
C
olin Hanks’
directorial debut,
Nos Amis, is a
powerful albeit
atypical music
documentary.
Opting to focus on the
humanity of its subjects far
more than their music, this
HBO production follows the
band Eagles of Death Metal
as they attempt to recover
from their ordeal at the
Bataclan. An impactful cold
open shows us the beginnings
of the concert as the energy
and life seen juxtaposes
with the foregone conclusion
already simmering in the
viewer’s mind. But the footage
ends abruptly, long before
the tragedy would occur. The
spectre of dread this evokes,
however, hangs over the rest
of the feature.
The piece is measured with
its pacing, spending the first
third of its runtime laying
the building up our central
subjects. At its core, this is a
story about two best friends,
and their almost extraordi-
narily clichéd friendship. We
focus, initially, on the shared
adolescence of Queens of
the Stone Age frontman
Josh Homme, and Eagles of
Death Metal frontman Jesse
Hughes. We hear about the
beginnings of their friendship
and the ‘fucking John Hughes
cliché’ that was the first time
they really got to know each
other. In their own words,
Jesse and Josh share this
story with us. Jesse, a stereo-
typical square is being bullied
at a high school party; forced
into the pool and not allowed
to come out. Josh, lumbering
Viking that he is, walks into
the party and comes to his
rescue. Exploration of the
incident sets up the major
themes of the documentary:
guilt and responsibility. In this
case, Jesse’s feeling of guilt
for not standing up for himself
and fighting back, and Josh’s
growing feelings of responsi-
bility towards Jesse.
In fact, these frank, honest,
and intimate interviews with
the pair form the emotional
backbone of the piece and
really help keep the audi-
ence’s interest. For obvious
reasons, more focus is given
to Jesse, with his retelling
of his childhood and early
adulthood painting a picture
of a man who has always
struggled to fit in, frequently
broken by circumstance.
Many observers, myself
included, have expressed
discomfort with some of Jes-
se’s statements. But for a man
that’s already so haphazardly
put together to take such a
shattering blow?
Well, it’s incredibly hard
not to give him a free pass.
It doesn’t help that, as with
many outspoken artists these

HBO
days who are aren’t the best
at expressing themselves,
detractors are ready to
bastardise and amplify cer-
tain statements over others.
Hanks, at least, goes to great
pains to portray Hughes
sympathetically whilst still not
shying away from addressing
Jesse’s more controversial
statements. Homme too
shows a vulnerability here
that, outside of his music, we
don’t see much of.
Following the story of the
formation of the Eagles of
Death Metal, which again
highlights the responsibility
Homme takes for Hughes, we
move onto the events of the
Bataclan. These are the doc-
umentary’s most harrowing
and tense moments,
as we hear
retellings
of the

night from those who were
there. Spliced in with inter-
views from the band are
interviews from members
of the concert’s audience,
together with actual footage
from it. The result is a frantic
and sobering immersion in
the brutality of the attack.
This equalisation of performer
and patron ties into the
piece’s title of ‘nos amis’; ‘our
friends’.
It codifies what Jesse talks
about throughout, the fact
that they were all in this
together and consequently
how he feels responsibility for
it. We also alternate between
Josh’s and Jesse’s stories of
the night; Jesse as he strug-
gles to escape, and Josh as
he finds out about the incident
and tries desperately to do
something about it. As these
parallel odysseys unfold,
each party’s feelings of guilt
over the night become clear.
Whilst Hughes experiences
survivor’s guilt, Homme feels
guilt over not having been
there to watch over Jesse, as
he always has before. That
this man and this band, who
have made fun and simplicity
their vocation, must know
find themselves in the midst of
such complexity and tragedy,
is unfortunate.
There’s plenty of star power
to be found here, as the
documentary even manages
to get an appearance from
Bono. It goes without saying
that the feature has a kick-ass
soundtrack, sampling not
only EoDM’s three albums,
but also QotSA’s exten-
sive discography. This is,
undoubtedly one of the
most poignant and
well-crafted docu-
mentaries of the
year. While fans
will of course
enjoy it, the
wider audi-
ence may
actually gain
more out of it;
getting to see
for themselves
the larger-than-
life people we
already know Josh
and Jesse to be.
\\ At its core, this is
a story about two
ordinary friends and
their extraordinarily
cliched friendship.\\
