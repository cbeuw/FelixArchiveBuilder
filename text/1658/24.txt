The Confused Nursery exhibition
A look into the intriguing Blythe gallery display from LeoSoc and PhotoSoc
Tom Mutimer
F
riday of last week,
I had the pleasure
of attending the
Blyth gallery for the
opening of a joint
exhibition between
Leonardo Fine Arts and
PhotoSoc, titled ‘Confused
Nursery’.
The space is a time machine
that will take you back to
days you hardly remember
and juvenile feelings that you
forgot existed (remember
feelings?). An eclectic array
of children’s toys, many of
which you’ll recall fondly,
is on display. And although
‘display’ is ostensibly the right
word, many of the items in
the space are not just meant
to be looked at, but to be
picked up and played with,
enjoyed in precisely the way
they were originally intended.
There’s no ironic element
intended; this exhibition is
to be enjoyed simply and
sincerely. There is a card-
board box tunnel/fort, but
not just any; the epic kind that
your six-year-old self would
have dreamed of building.
There’s a ball pit, and a
gigantic crayon doodle on
the floor. Slightly disjointed
with the rest of the display,
but nonetheless effective, is
a collection of hanging guns,
crafted from plastic bottles
and other domestic items.
Their silhouettes are cast on
the wall opposite, creating an
interesting illusion. Smatter-
ing the walls is a selection
of tasteful, and sometimes
thought-provoking, imagery
contributed by PhotoSoc.
I heard one guy announce
that he didn’t ‘get it’, which
highlighted for me the fact
that this is not the form of art
you will find in the Tate or
Tate Modern, for example:
unlike other exhibitions, that
try their hardest to appear
proper and fit expectations,
this one isn’t trying to imitate
the archetypal Art Gallery.
This is its greatest strength.
It’s not about standing for
ten minutes, reverent and
solemn, while you try and
unravel some impenetrable
monstrosity made by an artist
who cares more about being
avant-garde than making
something you’ll be able to
appreciate. In fact, reverent
and solemn are two words
that have nothing to do with
this exhibition. The joy that
it contains is immediately
apparent, and there is no
need to think too hard about
what any deeper, darker
meaning could be.
More interesting than the
space was doodled upon
with great velocity and aban-
don. There was face painting.
No one appeared to embody
the spirit of the exhibition as
much as LeoSoc committee
member Jack Campbell, who,
wearing an animal onesie,
juice box in one hand, crayon
in the other – but somehow
with dignity – strolled around
the place, just enjoying the
whole thing.
The evening was punctuated
with bursting balloons which,
like at a childhood birthday
party, are an unavoidable
side-effect, one that strangely
brought the whole room
together for a moment in
shocked gasps, while we fig-
ured out that none of us had
in fact died. It only reinforced
the best qualities of this
unique exhibition: inclusivity,
authenticity, and fun. Those
qualities LeoSoc Dev Sec
Sophie Inman imbued so
effortlessly into this defiantly
cheerful installation, behind
which she was the creative
and organisational driving
force.
The ‘Confused Nursery’
runs until 23rd
February, free
of charge, and is in the Blyth
Gallery, level 5 Sherfield
building.

exhibition in and of itself
was how it came alive on
the opening night: wine and
snacks were laid out, which
for a typical Blyth exhibition
is intended to provide a
sense of sophistication and
decorum. But the exciting
atmosphere of the room
swiftly did away with formal-
ity, and within minutes shoes
came off and people could
be seen crawling like toddlers
as they disappeared and
emerged at various points
in the tunnel. People sat on
the floor, playing with Lego
and assembling marble-runs,
and dived into hauntingly
epic novels such as ‘Elmer the
Elephant’. The assigned floor
