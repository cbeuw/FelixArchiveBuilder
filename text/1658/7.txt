Is the Union
fixing the
leadership
elections?
An anonymous writer discusses the
Union's interference in the democratic
process
I
t's a well known fact
that if you’re one of
the beautiful people,
you’re more likely to
be successful in the
Union elections. But
as well as having beauty
be a requirement, there is
also a culture of successful
candidates being chosen from
above.
To say that the Union (and by
that I mean the staff and stu-
dent trustees) have no say on
who wins the elections would
be to deny them credit for
their hard work in obscuring
the democratic process. While
technically, yes, the student
body does vote and elect the
winners, who chooses to run
and the nature of their cam-
paigns is incredibly dependent
on the advice they’ve been
given, which makes a huge
difference to who we elect.
Suitable candidates are often
headhunted, vetted, and per-
suaded to run. Year on year,
I’ve seen offhand comments
from a Sabb at a bar night
– “You’d be great at DPFS,
you should run!” – that were
not so offhand: they’d been
discussed extensively in the
Union offices before. Of
course, it is sometimes just
friendly encouragement to do
something you’re obviously
passionate about – they’re
\\ Whatever the Leadership
Elections are, they're definitely
not democratic, so let's not
pretend that they are \\
not all terrible people. But
these conversations about
the role and what’s best for
it going forward can subtly
brainwash candidates into
trusting the current policies,
not questioning and improving
them as would be their role.
Chosen candidates might
be told historically successful
campaigning strategies, and
informally prepped for the
role through friendly chats –
nothing technically against
the rules, but not everyone is
receiving this information, and
it lends a huge advantage.
Those who’ve won know that
campaigning often comes
down to a simple formula of
who gets their name out there
most and who does the most
lecture shout-outs (name recog-
nition and a trustworthy face
is key), and being backed by
someone in a position you
respect does a lot to help you
power through the exhausting
weeks of campaigning.
The Union (and by that I mean
the staff and student trustees)
have been known to help their
chosen candidates write mani-
festo points that they know are
achievable and in line with
their current aims: they fulfil
their bigger picture. In other
words, these candidates aren’t
bringing anything new to the
role in terms of ideas and stu-
dent representation.
It’s in the Union’s interest to
have docile, obedient officer
trustees. They want sabbs who
won’t make waves, who won’t
push a strong agenda. They
will work hard at the tasks
they’re given, sure, but their
manifesto points are just reiter-
ations of what was in the works
anyway. In other words, they
keep their mouths shut and let
the staff do their job: running
this multimillion pound charity
in the way that they see fit,
away from the interference of
annoying students who dare
to have opinions on what it
should be doing.
The students who do this
best are the ones who are in
it for the CV points – they care
a bit, but not enough to pro-
test too much at only being a
figurehead. Undeniably, this
is efficient. Nothing prevents
an idea being realised like a
clash between Union staff and
an officer trustee, where butt-
ing of heads can lead to deep
unpleasantness and a stalling
of any progress whatsoever.
From the perspective of those
who have worked hard on poli-
cies, either for a year or longer,
you don’t want someone with
different ideas to come in and
trash all your work. There’s
nothing like the illusion of
power to make people think
that what they’re doing is the
best, and it’s easy to lose track
of that and become incredibly
protective of your (sometimes
misguided) policies.
In many ways, the current
sabbs are the most qualified
to choose their replacements.
They know the ins and outs of
the role, and they should be
able to recognise what traits
will make a good candidate.
It’s great that the Union are
thinking about the students in
the many volunteering roles
and considering how they
could progress to bigger
things. When the Union hits
the mark, and wants to do
things that really are best for
Imperial students, this can be

really good. Our Union staff
have largely come to Impe-
rial after working in student
unions all over the country, and
between them have a wealth
of experience. Unfortunately,
the nature of Imperial as an
elite, science and engineer-
ing university means that the
needs of our students are a bit
different to those of students at
other British universities, and
too frequently the staff don’t
tailor their ideas to this. They
don’t always realise that what
worked well in Leeds may not
work at Imperial.
The policies and strategies
are being guided by the staff at
the Union and those who have
spent a year in the belly of the
beast and can’t remember the
real struggles that affect stu-
dents most. Bringing in more
people who are on the same
page can be a huge waste
of money that’s supposed to
be spent on representing the
actual voice of students. It isn’t
the students who stick to the
Union agenda who make a big
difference – it’s the ones who
call for radical change.
Whatever the Leadership
Elections are, they’re definitely
not democratic, so let’s not pre-
tend that they are.

An ode to my
roommate,
whom I love
\\ Sometimes I just wish
that everyone coud be
at least as lucky as I
am and have such an
awesome roommate \\
An anonymous writer shares their love
letter to their room- (and soul-) mate
I
love my roommate. Quite
the statement, isn’t it?
I love the way she never
turns off the lights and
always turns the desk light
on when I go to sleep
(even though I do it too). I
think it’s her way of making
sure that I get my light dose for
my photosynthetic processes.
I love how she makes a lot of
noise whenever she comes in
late – I think that the amount
of noise she is making is
proportional to the hours she’s
spent out before midnight and
inversely proportional to my
capacity to deal with it.
I love her street language –
I am just annoyed that I don’t
speak street. I would reaaaally
like to be able to say ‘yo’ and
’bruv’ the way she does. But I
know that she thinks about me
all the time because she says
these words only when we are
in public – when we are in our
room, she doesn’t say a thing.
I love the way she waits in
front of the door whenever
I go into the bathroom in the
morning and invades the
bathroom as soon as I am
out, even if I am just out just
because I forgot my lipstick
in the room. I guess that I just
have to wait or skip lipstick
because she ain’t gonna finish
in time for me. See, I actually
can speak street, I’m just not
very good at the 'yo' part. But
I’ll learn, no worries!
I love how she never gets
her hair out of the shower
and it regularly gets stuck in
the drain and how regularly
the bathroom gets flooded;
and how afterwards, she
just pretends that nothing
happened, no matter how
many times you ask her;
and after a while, the room
floods too and then she can
no longer pretend nothing
happened but she still audibly
wonders how this happened!
And I don’t say that my hair is
not in there, too – but it is not!
I dare you to DNA test it and
see if you can find more than
one hair that’s mine.
I like how her half of the room
is just a mess. I don’t say that
my half is the cleanest place in
the universe, but I try to keep
my things on my desk mainly –
the only messy things about me
are vast quantities of papers
and books pilling up– on my
desk! But her clothes and shoes
and food and everything just
invades her desk and the floor

place. It looked really
cool – exactly the
kind of art I love \\

her not-so-sexy underwear
hanging everywhere all the
time. Who wouldn’t?
Did I mention that one time
she went hiking for a weekend
and when she came back she
left muddy traces all over the
carpet? It looked really cool –
exactly the kind of art I love!
Isn’t it really nice of her that she
thinks about my mental well-
being and aesthetic choices?
Of course she didn’t bother
to clean up, but (un)lucky me,
the cleaning crewwas due to
come the following Tuesday.
And on top of everything,
she actually knows how much
and the beds and everything.
I am quite amazed by what
wonder my half of the floor
is not packed with all kinds of
'treasures'. Oh wait, I know –
because normally, my half is
the one that gets flooded first.
I love how she loves the
environment so much that
she never uses the washing
machines and always hand
washes her clothes in the sink
– don’t ask me how it works! I
think it must be another one of
her super-powers or something
because she still just manages
to flood everything all the time.
And of course I love to see all
\\ The amount of

I love her. Probably. That must
be why she just assumes that
she can just take my things
(almost) all the time, from pens
and staplers and papers to
soap and once, my foundation,
even if my skin tone is at least
four shades lighter. Or has the
wrong undertone. But, hey,
she totally managed to rock
the look!
So, yes, I do love my
roommate and, as you can
see, I have a lot of reasons
to. Sometimes I just wish that
everyone could be at least as
lucky as I am and have such
an awesome roomie! Yo!
