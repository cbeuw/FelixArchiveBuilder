Enter the kink | Looning B.C. Maile
Have you ever looked at a balloon and thought “I would”? Well you know what they say. You
haven’t really played until you’ve played with a 16-inch balloon. And by they I mean looners.
D
an got into
the shower,
washing himself.
Holly said she
would clear up
the mess they
had made after the pump-
to-pop in the sleeping bag.
He still couldn't believe what
Holly did for his birthday.
They had had a few sessions
with balloons before but
nothing like this. Last time
they had a blow-to-pop race
with twelve inches, it was fun
but Dan didn't know Holly
would get into it, she must
have been practicing. After
a few minutes Holly enters
the bathroom, completely
naked, holding a red balloon.
It’s deflated but looks like a
16-inch.
"Ready for a bit more fun?"
She says in a sexy voice.
Dan feels his heart starting
to race. Holly steps into the
shower with him and takes the
shower head off.
"What are you doing?" Asks
Dan.
"You'll see." She places the
neck over the balloon, it starts
to fill with water.
"Sit down, you're going to
enjoy this." She says.
That was an excerpt from a
story written by Wildheart, a
senior member of a ‘looner’
forum called blow2pop.
Looners are people who
have a sexual attraction to
inflatable objects or the act
of inflation, deflation or burst-
ing. Looking online I found
vast quantities of YouTube
and XTube videos exhibiting
this exotic fetish, and forums
for like-minded people to
share experiences. Like most
well-established fetishes,
looning comes with a nice set
of terms to describe specific
activities or subgroups.
object for popping.
From reading popping
stories, it looks like a lot
of the sexiness lies in the
anticipation. For the B2Pers,
the uncertainty of when
the balloon will pop plays
a big role, so it’s sort of an
abstracted form of sexual
teasing. Like a lot of kinks and
fetishes, there seems to be an
element of catharsis involved
too. The sudden change of
state from order to disorder
seems to bring with it a sense
of release, which fits into the
sexual dynamic.
Non-poppers are inflatable
some custom-made to include
a ‘love hole’, although this is
an uncommon feature.
I saw a lot of fantasies
about being in collapsing
bouncy castles, or involv-
ing the ‘riding down’ of an
inflatable, which is basically
sitting on it until it’s out of air.
The sound of the air rushing
out of the object is apparently
quite a turn on. There were
also those who liked the idea
of sitting on something as it
was pumped up, with some
of like butts, legs and boobs
so that’s probably part of it.
As for the smell and sound,
past experiences can shape
people in extremely complex
ways. Most people on these
forums believe that their inter-
est started very early on, with
some remembering specific
childhood experiences. One
user wrote about a balloon
being popped in his face
at a birthday party, which
led to a life long phobia of
balloon popping, but a strong
sexual affinity for balloons
and inflatables. This type of
story is far from uncommon in
the looning community. They
even endearingly describe
people with this relationship
to inflatables as ‘Phobics’.
It seems that, whatever the
reason, looning runs deep.
For one man, it ran deep
enough to destroy his mar-
riage. Sharing these feelings
doesn’t always end up going
well, but for the vast majority
of cases, the partners tend to
be at most indifferent. In some
cases they’re even willing to
indulge, so it doesn’t always
end in tears.
Whilst I’d be lying if I said
this isn’t bizarre for my stand-
ards, I know for sure that it’s
not hurting anyone (beyond
maybe causing a slight ring-
ing in the ears). So if you’re a
looner, popper or phobic, just
know that you’re not alone.
Be yourself and loon on, you
crazy diamond.
fetishists who don’t have any
interest in the bursting of
inflatables. Whilst having a
lot in common with poppers,
their interest lies solely in the
objects. A common theme
is the rubbing of inflatable
objects on the body or
genitals, inflating them with
a pump, or deflating them.
Inflatable pool toys, love dolls
or airbeds are often ridden
or sat on for satisfaction, with
having preferences for types
of valves, with Boston valves
being a common favourite.
The derivation of pleasure
seems to stem from a wide
range of stimuli, but for most
looners it is about the feel,
smell and sound. It’s hard to
pin down exactly what is sexy
about a fetish. If you could,
it probably wouldn’t be a
fetish. I guess inflated things
have curves and shapes kind

Looners are separated into
two main groups, ‘Poppers’
and ‘non-poppers’.
A popper is an individual
who derives satisfaction from
bursting inflatable objects.
This can be achieved in a
variety of ways and enjoyed
for a multitude of reasons.
Poppers enjoy activities such
as popping balloons under-
foot, hugging and squeezing
balloons tight until they burst.
Another popular one is B2P
or blow-to-pop; this is inflating
the balloon, usually by mouth
until it pops. This is generally
done with ear plugs so not to
damage hearing as the noise
can be loud, especially when
playing with larger balloons.
Others are aroused by the
idea of popping balloons with
pens, pencils, pins or knives,
and often have a preferred
