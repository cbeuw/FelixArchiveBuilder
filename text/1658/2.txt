et’s be honest. Everything we do, we do in the
name of fun. Sure you can use fancy lingo, such
as pleasure, satisfaction, gratification, joy, and
even gusto if you’re that kind of person, but at
the end of the day, fun does the trick just fine.
The reason we make babies is because sex
is fun. The reason we keep ourselves fed is because
eating good food is fun. The reason we push for social
justice, is because being fairly and justly is fun. Printing
2,000 copies of this self-indulgent paper every week
is FUN.
I guess in a way it’s appropriate that this is the fun
issue – we always had great timing. It’s our last issue
before nominations close and campaigning for the
Leadership Elections begins. It’s appropriate because
if you’re thinking of running, you should be thinking
about fun. The sabbatical roles (the officer trustee
positions, the ICSM pres and the felix editor roles) can
be surprisingly hard, especially if you are even going
to attempt doing a good job. Sure they can be easy,
because you could just sit around all day doing fuck
all and no one would bat an eyelid (with the exception
of the felix editor – people would very quickly notice
if the paper stopped coming out, or if instead of a
centrefold you just got a scan of my butt… though now
that I think about it...), but if you’re planning on doing
that you really shouldn’t be running in the first place.
If you’re going to be running you need to think about
the enjoyment you’ll be getting out of your work.
Whether that’s through problem solving, or caring
for people or publishing a pretty kick-ass paper
every week (with “new age centrefolds” and snazzy
graphics). If you don’t get a high from carrying out the
duties of the role, then you’ll either not care enough
to do your job properly, or give it your best and crash
and burn.
The sabbatical roles are a great opportunity for
students to get their hands dirty and bring about some
much needed change. And with the right people filling
these roles they can be and should be fun.
So if you’re running, good luck and if you’re not, you
have till Sunday to change your mind!
