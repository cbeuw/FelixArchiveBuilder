Little Simz
Welcome to
Wonderland:
The
Experience
L
ittle Simz, real name
Simbi Ajikawo,
returned to the
Roundhouse Rising
show, having
performed a headline
set in 2014. This year, she
headlined and curated a
varied line-up of emerging
talent. An art installation
accompanied the show,
with the Wonderland theme
in focus throughout. An
animation introduced her
performance, with a cartoon
Little Simz asking Cheshire
“Why am I here?” His
response: “Simply, you’re
here to fuck up the balance”.
Ajikawo’s energy is on full
pelt from the start. The set list
is based heavily off her latest
LP, Stillness in Wonderland.
The tracks take on a new
optimistic life with the live
band. On the album, the
vibe is hazy – it seems the
wonderland is an escape
Simz uses to cope with her
struggles. We’re invited along
to follow her in her journey
though the rabbit hole, and
the experience is immersive.
Even when the lyrics are
dark, her dynamism onstage
means the mood is liberating
rather than wallowing. On
Trust Issues, she raps Nobody
is an angel these days/if you
disagree please speak up
please say. It is clear Little
Simz is at her most comfort-
able rapping and singing,
is God Bless Mary, a song
dedicated to her neigh-
bour for never complaining
about the loud music next
door. The audience gains
perspective: Simbi is only 22
and was working from her
home not long ago. Despite
her success and critical
acclaim worldwide, Little
Simz has remained defiantly
independent and true to
herself. Kendrick Lamar said
she “might be the illest doing
it right now”. Her style is
more hip-hop than grime,
but she is no stranger to the
scene, having worked with
an impressive set of artists
on the album. Ghetts and
Chip join her onstage for an
electric performance of King
of Hearts, and for the finale
of the show she is joined by
Stormzy and Kano for Dead
Body.

\\ She might be the

and she commands the stage
effortlessly. Between tracks,
the atmosphere falters slightly
– there is little introduction to
each song and the fact that
this is her biggest show to
date starts to show. Despite
her nerves, she never ceases
to be lively and charming.

J
ust last week,
Camden’s very
own Roundhouse
opened its doors to
artists and industry
professionals as
part of their Artist Toolkit Day.
The event included a series
of performances, clinics, talks
and collaborations during the
weeklong Roundhouse Rising
Festival.
I made my way to the iconic
venue on Sunday morning,
collected my wristband and
nestled into a seat amongst
roughly forty others, pen and
notebook in hand, starry-eyed
and eager to learn something
I didn’t know about the world
of music. Around me, others
eyed up their peers. Some
made a daring effort to stand
out with 90s inspired bowl
cuts, snake skin knee high
boots and in one instance,
a Hello Kitty bomber jacket.
Others were social butterflies,
floating from one guitar sling-
ing twenty-something year
old to the next with the oddly
familiar: “what kinda music
do you make?”, or “what
genre do you listen to?” More
often than not people smiled
and shrugged: “A bit of
everything y’know?”
Soon after, lights were
dimmed, and the talks began
with the familiar squeal of
mic feedback and a unani-
mous wince. We were taken
through the various gears and
cogs of the music industry.
First with an introduction to
the world of PR, then licens-
ing, management, publishing,
booking agents and finally
the label industry. The panel
included speakers from Coda,
Imagem, BBC Extra and Uni-
versal Music each with their
own set of tips, insider secrets
and almost always a story
of struggle, opportunity and
eventually success.
Throughout the day we
were reminded that though
there was no fixed recipe for
success, you could only go so
far without a manager, label,
PR agent and yada yada
yada.
“Can I send in an appli-
cation to a PR company or
publisher?” Someone asked.
“Not really” replied the
speaker, “we don’t accept
unsolicited mail.”
“Can I apply in hopes of
unsolicited mail.”
Soon enough, there
appeared to be a trend and
we were left baffled by the
catch-22.
With the means to make
music becoming far more
accessible and with music
itself becoming far more avail-
able, industry professionals
have had to shield themselves
right in the middle of a web
of industry professionals, they
curate their roster, represent
their artists, but most of all
they deliver consistent talent
to their peers. A manager
with a solid reputation are
your keys to the industry.
This way, PR representation,
licensing, and booking gurus
are simply an email away. So
instead of trying to win over
your allies one by one, simply
get yourself a well-respected
manager.
“Can I email a management
company and ask to join their
roster?”
Ironically, management
companies too do not accept
unsolicited mail. However
unlike their industry coun-
terparts, these guys can be
found floating around the
live music scene keeping
their eyes peeled for the
next big thing. And that’s
not all. In fact, behind the
scenes industry professionals
will frequently share hotly
tipped artists to one another,
trying to gauge the interest
of their peers. With their ears
pressed up against closed
doors, managers will listen
out for chatter. The louder the
chatter, the more appealing
it becomes to add the artist in
question to their roster.
So where does all this chat-
ter come from?
Lets say you play a gig,
or you upload a track to a
streaming website, or you col-
laborate with an established
artist and somehow word gets
around. More likely than not,
the news will be picked up
by the safety net we called
A&R scouts. Scouts dwell in
the corners of dingy clubs
and gig venues and will often
look unassuming, sipping on
a pint of lager. The difference
is, once they’ve finished that
pint, they report straight back
to HQ. Good, bad, or simply
weird, the message gets back
and nothing goes unmissed.
Why? Because nothing is
worse than missing the next
big act.
So what does that mean
for you? Not much really. But
understanding what goes on
behind the curtain is a nice
little reminder that you and
your music do the talking.
With a couple of solid tracks
under your belt and a stirring
live performance, you too
could be the next big thing.
Just remember, “We do not
accept unsolicited mail”.
from the resulting fall out.
It appeared as though
companies across the board
gradually started relying on
stamps of approval from their
contemporaries as a means of
time and resource manage-
ment as they sifted through
the heaps of emerging new
music.
Surely this makes it more
difficult to land a deal with
anyone in the industry?
Nope. In fact, this couldn’t be
further from the truth.
Instead of having to impress
multiple members the industry
with your singer or songwriter
skills, now you merely need to
impress one. A manager.
