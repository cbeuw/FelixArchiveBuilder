H
a! Yes, this news
brings a hearty,
jolly, honest laugh
from the deepest
regions of my heart.
The man himself, the
wondrous Donald Trump has taken
on yet another pitiful ‘progressive’
law and crushed it in his mighty,
massive, and muscular hands.
Jeff Sessions is one of the most
honest to God men that I have ever
known. He was a delight to have
as a dinner guest just last week at
the Dasters’ Mansion, and truly
a saint as the Attorney General.
With his expert guidance and
ability, I have no doubt that the
United States will return to its roots
of being an institution made for the
American people, by the American
people.
His decision to roll back the
devil’s schemes to pollute our
children’s minds with sick ‘choices’
and ‘freedoms’ is true progres-
sion. Yet another huge victory for
those who will remain in the right
of history. Finally, my daughters
will not have to fear a ‘self-identi-
fied woman’ man from staring at
her body in the restroom. Those
poisoned freaks will be taught
the true meaning of freedom.
Remember, there is no freedom
without restriction. True American
freedom is, and has always been,
grounded in the Christian values of
purity. This refers to purity in our
hearts and minds, and the ignorant
and delusional ‘progressives’
have spent most of the 21st
century
corrupting our youth with sexual
immoralities. Such hypocrites, as
they seek liberation with the devil,
they lobby to take away our God
given rights to bear arms and free-
dom of speech. Pushing their toxic
narrative through fake news outlets
such as CNN and Huffington Post,
and taking away the voices of
good, honest Americans.
Yes, their motives are clear: by
poisoning our young ones, they
gain power over the future of our
wealth. But we, the 0.01%, didn’t
get to our socioeconomic standings
by being stupid. No, it was through
our fathers’ hard work and dili-
gence and our continued hoarding
of the country’s wealth. So we will
fight back, as we always have, by
maintaining our purity. Purity of
heart and mind, as well as of the
body. That is correct, Demarco,
you will not be taking my daughter
to prom this year, and you will
only refer to myself as Sir and my
daughter as Miss.
Donald Trump, keep up the
fantastic work. I continue to look
forward to tomorrow, to see what
this magical man has to offer
humanity.
I
didn’t want to mention this
scum again. I didn’t want
his Cheeto flavoured name
appearing anywhere near
my mouth, violating it with its
orange, rancid, artificial taste.
I wanted to focus on the beauty
of this world from my safe space
(in my mum’s bed) and just enjoy
my Matcha green tea latte (made
from real Matcha, unlike those that
touch the tongues of uncultured
swine who visit oppressive chain
coffee stores like Starbucks
*literally vomiting right now*) and
explore my sexuality and emotions
through Instagram comics.
But here we are. The oversized
oompa loompa has finally gone
and done it. He’s done the one
thing that ensures that the age of
self-determination and self-respect
are far behind us. He has endan-
gered our children in the most
disgusting and vile way possible.
Yes, this pussy-grabbing cislord has
doomed us all. He has rolled back
the guidelines for the protection
of transgender students, citing
“a need to consider further legal
issues”.
Now transgender students
will no longer be able to use
restrooms and facilities associated
with their gender identity. This is
rape. There is no other way of
putting this. These sick bastards
are forcing innocent, curious chil-
dren to adhere to expired social
constructs, and continue to cram
sexual misinformation down their
unprepared throats.
Make no mistake, this is a
direct assault on the freedoms
of all people: young, old, black,
Asian, trans, gay, female… What
is stopping these dictators from
“rolling back” on other discrimi-
nation laws? Perhaps they don’t
want black people voting or else
in 2020 they would get another
Barack Hussein Obama Bin Laden
at the helm of the “greatest country
in the world” (except it’s not,
because the USA is literally under
oppression at the moment). Or,
may the spirits forbid, they take
away women’s rights. Well alright,
women barely have rights to begin
with, since men continue to deny
their institutionalised, societal, and
internalised misogyny. IT’S NOT
THAT HARD TO ADMIT YOU’RE
A SEXIST. What is stopping them
from taking away the liberties
that women deserve? Of course
I am not a woman myself, but I
personally believe that women are
definitely the leaders of today and
tomorrow. Watch as it will be a
female scientist who will discover
the cure for cancer, not a man. We
are of the past.
We have truly entered the dark-
est timeline, may the spirits have
mercy on us all.
Except for you, white cis males,
you will be just fine. Oh and that
orange pile of dung as well.
WOMEN WILL INHERIT
THE EARTH!
Don Ma has had it with this
regressive policy bullshit
Our fathers worked
hard for all our
inherited wealth
Mon Da just wants to be held by
Donald Trump’s strong, manly,
yuuuuge hands
