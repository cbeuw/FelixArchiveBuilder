Macbeth |
Breathing
new life into
Shakespeare
S
hakespeare
for schools is
an attempt by
director Justin
Audibert to bring
Shakespeare
closer to a ‘younger
audience’: school children,
especially those who may
have been disillusioned by
endless GCSE English lessons
analysing iambic pentameter,
may not have had the
chance to step back and
simply appreciate gripping
Shakespearean narratives,
such as Macbeth.
Macbeth is a play that you
would think well-suited to
an adaptation of this kind
– with satisfying amounts
of black magic, murder,
and back-stabbing, which
Audibert, together with the
cast and team, attempt to
exploit to the fullest extent.
The play’s pace is rapid and
the scenes action-packed,
with the production’s length
half that of the traditional
script, making for an engag-
ing storyline that makes
it difficult not to become
engrossed in. The characters
are expressive: Macbeth
(Nana Amoo-Gottfried)
delivers animated soliloquies,
which were fairly terrifying;
Lady Macbeth (Madeline
Appiah) is as tragic as you
could hope for – the cold
ghosts of her terrible deeds
haunting the Dorfman Thea-
tre as she attempts to wash
a perennial smear of
non-existent blood
off her hands as
she stares blankly
through the
audience,
pupils the size
of pinholes.
From the
off, there
was the
immediate
evocation
of a tribal
atmosphere.
A thunder-
ous, rhythmic
percussion com-
plements much
of the action, with
war drums banging in
a regular rhythm: sound
is evidently a major part of
this performance – a part of
the attempt, it seems, to keep
younger viewers of the play
interested – and it seems
to work. Actors in ragged
clothes run round chanting
and bashing sticks together,
with the odd haunting
Gaelic chant giving a nod
to the play’s original Scottish
setting.
What I found particularly
odd, were the strange
anachronisms that introduced
themselves now and again
– notably Macbeth dons a
WW1-era gas-mask at sev-
eral points. While my initial
thoughts were that they were
short on props, it became
clear that this was a delib-
erate theme, with jerry cans
and metal flasks popping up
everywhere. It was refreshing
to see Macbeth performed in
such a different way, but I felt
the mix of tribe-like culture
and post-apocalyptic society
were too much with too little
explanation and were poten-
tially confusing.
Although the fast pace of
the play, combined with the
archaic language, did make it
slightly difficult to understand
the finer points at times, this
was compensated for by
other methods of exposition:
there is much movement in
the play, and many thrilling

fight scenes to keep the
story moving, all different
in their own way – eerie
necromancy being practiced
in one mad scrum turns into
a rough knife-fight to the
death in the next. Despite
an arguably docile scene at
the end, where a gas mask is
raised into the air in triumph,
as opposed to a real head,
in general they don’t skimp
on the gruesome details: in
one particularly horrifying
moment Lady Macbeth’s
throat is slit in a frankly hor-
rifying display which would
satisfy the hunger for gore of
the greediest viewers.
It seems as though Audibert
wished the characters to stay
true to much of the original
dialogue – Shakespearean
language is, of course, part
of the experience – with the
occasional addition, and
frequent omission to cut
the performance to a more
manageable length, allowing
for scenes to focus on other
aspects such as physical
movement. The abridgement
of the script was done well:
the story didn’t really feel
as if it was missing anything
and flowed throughout. Most
importantly, the production
accomplished its goal of
adapting Macbeth to enthuse
younger audiences about
the works of the literary
behemoth, whose plays are
often unfairly stereotyped
as difficult or outdated. The
creative way in which the
story of Macbeth was
told throws a new
light on Shake-
speare and begs
the question of
why – given the
success of a TV
show like Game
of Thrones,
which is similar
in terms of
the combina-
tion of kingly
power-struggles,
violence, and
betrayal – tales
like Macbeth don’t
have just as much of
a passionate following
among the youth of
today. Perhaps the old tales
simply need new voices.

T
homas Ostermeier’s
production of
Richard III is a
celebration of the
wicked, the tragic,
and the profane.
The play is on tour from
Schaubühne Berlin and is
performed entirely in German
with English surtitles on the
stage.
Not only is this a departure
from the original Shake-
speare in terms of language,
but also in setting and style.
Thanks to a soundtrack of
loud industrial music, a live
on-stage drummer, pyrotech-
nics, and shouted German,
the play at times feels like
a concert by heavy-metal
band Rammstein. Fittingly
Richard is portrayed by
Lars Eidinger – a renowned
German theatre and televi-
sion actor – like a depraved
rock star. This portrayal is
no doubt greatly influenced
by Rammstein’s frontman
Till Lindemann... Edinger
flourishes in a role where he
can be lewd and shocking:
his comedy is deeply cynical,
and he delights in breaking
the fourth wall. At one point
He is a hunchback with a
deformed foot, deeply bitter
and cynical: “I am deter-
mined to prove a villain /
And hate the idle pleasures of
these days”. Pathological in
his obsession for power, and
very much aware of the irony
of his circumstance – “I'll

know whether to laugh or
be appalled. The setting is
self-consciously anachronistic,
the opening scene begins
with the cast in tuxedos
and designer dresses as the
royalty sip from champagne
flutes. This works well – Rich-
ard III is full of references to
the debauchery of the house
of York, at a time when lei-
sure meant banquets, masked
balls, and waltzing. Making
this apparent to a modern
audience means updating
costumes, locations, and
references.
Richard III’s corpse was
identified and exhumed
from a city council car park
in Leicester, by a team of
archaeologists and scientists
at Leicester University in 2012
who then restored the remains
to Leicester Cathedral. He
was the last English monarch
to be killed in battle and his
death marked the end of the
house Plantagenet and rise of
the Tudors. Over generations
his physical whereabouts may
have been forgotten, but his
character was not, and thanks
to Shakespeare’s pro-Tu-
dor agenda he has been

Whether his infamy is
deserved or not is still an
area of debate. Either way,
Richard III is not a great play
due to its historical accuracy,
but instead because it tells a
timeless story of the creation
of an anti-hero through the
politics of rejection. For all its
absurdity, Schaubühne Ber-
lin’s production touches the
heart of Richard III’s charac-
ter – it is a shocking depiction
of the face of tyranny at such
an apposite moment in global
politics.

is filled with similar interrup-
tions, such as Edinger reading
aloud the English surtitles,
interrogating members of
the audience going to the
bathroom, or at one point
rapping the script out loud to
rock music.
Despite these alterations the

the right casting choice to
carry these traits forward.
The progression of Richard
from anti-hero, whose actions
appal but whose rhetoric
enamours, to pure villain is
eloquently portrayed. By the
time the two princes have
been murdered in the tower
we very much empathise with
Queen Elizabeth and Marga-
ret, despite earlier their being
the butt of Richard’s jokes and
scorn. One striking alteration
is that the battle at the end is
replaced by a short physical
monologue where Richard
is murdered and suspended
precariously from the theatre
ceiling by his foot.
The production does not
surrender any of its idiosyn-
crasy to the English theatre
tradition, and retains the clear
marks of German absurd-
ity: Richard strips nude and
removes his hunchback and
club-foot when courting Lady
Anne; similarly the murder
of Clarence is made darkly
humorous but also excessively
gory, and the effect is one
of cognitive dissonance –
