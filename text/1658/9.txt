ave you ever
been bitten by a
tick? Hopefully
not. But if you
have, maybe
make sure you
are not infected with any
of the near fatal diseases
that ticks sometimes carry.
Ticks, like mosquitoes can
be vectors of diseases like
Kyasanur Forest disease and
the more widely spread Lyme
disease which affects nearly
3,00,000 people in USA and
65,000 in Europe each year.
Apart from causing extreme
discomfort in the form of
itchiness that sometimes
borders on agony, people
suffering from Lyme disease
experience severe muscle
aches, fatigue and high fever.
How is it that the bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi
responsible for Lyme disease
affects humans to such a
large extent, without harming
the ticks themselves? Scientists
from University of Maryland’s
School of Medicine have
now found out how ticks
manage not to succumb to the
infection of the bacteria they
so generously harbour.
Though ticks appear
similar to most insects, the
functioning of their immune
system has been found out
to be very different. They
seem to be missing the genes
that are pivotal in directing
immune response. Through
a process called RNA inter-
ference, where RNA is used
to obstruct the expression of
a gene, a gene named IMD
was identified that contains
the key codes required to
trigger an immune system
response in mosquitoes. This
gene was however missing
in ticks. Several other crucial
genes were also found to
be missing. For example,
PGRP, a crucial molecular
component required for
immune responses in mosqui-
toes, helps identify invading
microbes by the presence of
sugar in their cell walls and
thereby triggers the immune
system response. Though this
molecular component was
also found to be present in
ticks, it did not seem to affect
Borrelia burgdorferi in any
way.
The pathways that link the
immune system, the IMD and
PGRP are the same in both
mosquitoes and ticks, how-
ever the mechanism in which
they work are entirely differ-
ent. In mosquitoes and other
insects, the immune system
responses are triggered
on the detection of sugar
molecules in the cell wall of
the invading bacterium. But
the tick immune system is
triggered upon detection of
fat molecules instead.
Further examination of
Borrelia burgdorferi revealed
that it does not have a sugary
cell wall that mosquitoes and
other insects respond to, but
that it has one composed of
fat molecules instead. Ticks,
therefore, appear to have an
immune system that is spe-
cifically adapted to handle
this. It is also believed that
Borrelia burgdorferi may also
contain an anti-freeze protein
that helps ticks to thrive in
freezing temperatures.
The differences in the
mechanisms and work-
ings of the immune system
between insects and ticks are
an indication that the two
evolved separately. Scientists
therefore believe that ticks
and other insects have an
evolutionary distance of
nearly 500 million years, sim-
ilar to that between humans
and fish.
Increase in the deer pop-
ulation is believed to be the
reason why more people
are being infected by Lyme
F
act: Dogs can smell
cancer.
A charity called
“Medical Detection
Dogs” is undertak-
ing the first clinical
trial looking at using sniffer
dogs to do something a little
more holistic than seeking
out drugs and sausages at
Manchester Airport.
The procedure is simple –
wee in a pot, pooch gives it
a sniff and if they sit down
you have over a 90% chance
of having prostate cancer.
Men everywhere should be
rejoicing: current detection
of prostate cancers relies on
tests with high false positive
rates. This can lead to men
undergoing unnecessary
exploratory surgery (which
carries complication risks
of erectile dysfunction and
incontinence), but the use of
detection dogs as a second
line of testing before surgery
could help to reduce the
damage caused by unneeded
procedures. It’s not just for
men though – early reports
suggest that the dogs may
detect other types of cancers,
including breast and lung.
Their secret is a highly
tuned sense of smell (about
100,000 times more sensitive
than humans). Cancer cells
show altered metabolism to
normal cells, and so produce
different waste products.
These waste products are
then released in the patient’s
urine, breath or blood and
dogs can be trained to pick
up their characteristic odour
to help diagnose early and
elusive cancers. Yet more
proof that dogs > cats.

disease in the recent years.
Extended periods of warm
weather further help the ticks
not just to survive and persist,
but also to spread. Ticks are
most likely to catch the Borre-
lia ‘bug’ during their lymph
stage from smaller animals
like rodents and birds which
they cling on to. As they grow
bigger, they transfer onto
larger hosts like deer. The
deer however are not infected
or affected by Borrelia
burgdorferi, even though they
play hosts to the ticks.
Scientists are now exploring
ways in which the immune
system of the ticks can
be tweaked in order to
strengthen it and make the
ticks less vulnerable to a bac-
terial invasion. They hope this
helps prevent transmission of
bacterial infections like Lyme
disease from ticks to humans.
