All hail the mighty Internet
Do you remember the days when you had to actually chat to your friends or neighbours or call
your mom to find out how to cook something new? Well, neither do I, because we’re all used to
using the almighty godly internet instead.
G
ood
thing that
nowadays
you are
only a
search away
from “I want to try some
Thai tonight!” or “How
am I supposed to eat an
artichoke?”. But sometimes
the Internet does more bad
than good and gives too
many recommendations. I
mean, how are you supposed
to decide between that
perfect steak and the perfect
cake? What about that oh
so easy to make soup recipe
you stumbled upon the other
day? I mean, I know you want
to eat them all, but you don’t
want to waste all your life
cooking – a.k.a. becoming
a chef – and you promised
yourself that you are going to
lose a few pounds so you’re
money to spend on a nice
cut of meat, I will be writing
about something that is not
a cake – my weak point. For
me, this recipe has a nice
story because this is the first
time my friend (read it as that
special someone) told me
that normally they hate pork
but they have no problem
eating mine because it’s just
so good – and there’s nothing
sexual in that statement. My
self esteem as a cook after
that grew exponentially which
I’m thankful for. But enough
about my life, assuming that
you are not here to read a
diary.
This time we’ll be trying Vin-
daloo ribs – recommended
by Tastemade. This is the kind
of food you don’t make unless
you have a lot of time and
you are pretty confident in
your skills. The actual cooking
is pretty simple, but there are
a lot of ingredients and I sus-
pect that just too much or too
little of any one of them could
ruin the whole dish. The main
point about this particular
recipe is the harmony of the
spice combination. But give
it a try next weekend when
you are once again pretend-
ing to be studying. Keep in
mind that you should know
beforehand when you want to
eat it as it requires a 24 hour
preparation. I recommend
two slabs of pork ribs.
Cucumber dip
½ cup Greek yogurt
½ cucumber
½ tsp cumin – also skipped this
cumin; can you see the pattern
here?
Zest and juice from ½ lime
Salt and pepper
Andrada Balmez
Marinade
10 garlic cloves (in my opinion,
the more, the merrier and yes, I
remember what I said about the
proportions of this recipe, but no
one ever complained that there’s
too much garlic in my food – ok,
maybe once)
2 serrano peppers – can be
replaced by jalapenos
ginger root
Grind the garlic, ginger
and serranos (or jalapenos)
together. Rub into the ribs and
wrap tightly with plastic wrap
and let it rest in the fridge for
24 hours – or less, if you are
in a hurry.

me here as I typically have a
bunch of people to feed at all
times and don’t feel the time
pressure to test everything the
internet has to offer. For obvi-

at the best dish I’ve tested in
the past month (worth all the
trouble).

When you decide that you
really need to eat the ribs,
toast all the spices in a pan

are cooking. The key in this

you don’t have a grinder – is
to grind all the spices to a

Brunch means lazy morning,
indulgent eating, and a general
disregard for adult meal norms. If
you’re anything like us brunch is
more important to you than both
breakfast and lunch. This is why
we went out and found the hottest
spots around London where you
can eat what you want, when you
want.
