Emily
Middlebrough
Whether she can see or not,
Emily always finds the back of
the goal. Just don’t touch her
coat, alright!?
Emma Couves
Provided she isn’t getting
injured, this girl will get that
ball up the pitch no matter
what. If you’re lucky you may
even get to see her signature
move.
Emma Flynn
You can always count on
this defender to not let those
freshers past without a fight,
no matter how dirty she has
to play.
Hayley
Thompson
The longest standing team
member, Hayley has four pre-
vious varsities under her belt.
Specialising in stick work,
this girl knows how to handle
hockey players.
Georgie
Wearing
After a year’s hiatus from all
things varsity, our goalie is
back! She may sound nice,
but she will stop you from
scoring, unless of course
you’re Irish with big thighs.
Jess Omassoli
After a brief stint on the dark
side, she finally saw the light
and donned the blue kit. Her
main focus is hockey, but that
doesn’t mean she is afraid to
engage in some rugby.
Jess Sharp
Fancy a cocktail? You’ve
found your girl! Don’t worry
though, she still has time to
showcase her mean hitting
skills and something else if
you’re lucky.
Nora Clarke
This defender has got our
right side covered. Known for
impressive fancy dress, she
will be sure to fool you. Sorry
to break it to you though,
you’re not the only one she
loves!

Alice Tidswell
Regularly spotted in RSM
attire, this girl is ready to
increase her already high
scoring record.
Oh, and she is pretty sweet at
hockey too!
With Varsity fast approaching, we thought we’d put a spotlight on the women over at IC Hockey. Their sticks are ready, their gumshields have been washed and the kit has been given the Daz treat-
ment. Let’s find out who will be facing off against those pesky Medics.
Alicia Logan
A new Masters addition,
Alicia may be small but she is
a force to be reckoned with.
You won’t know she’s there
until she’s long gone, with the
ball and your dignity.
Becky Rickman
You think Finding Dory was
this year’s hit, more like Find-
ing Becky! Never knowing
when she will show her face,
one thing is for sure: Becky
strutting her way into Varsity.
Bobbi Lang
She may be playing club, but
that doesn’t mean she has
forgotten ICHC. This physicist
knows all the right angles to
get IC the win.
Chantal Fifield
A forward’s nightmare, our
girls know nothing gets past
Chantal. With an unrivalled
stamina that is just waiting to
be put to good use, no doubt
Varsity will be the perfect
occasion.
Charlotte
Baumhauer
Whether Charlotte’s skilfully
playing her way up the left
wing or downing the drinks
in the union, our resident
German will happily show all
you boys how it’s done!
Claudia
Jackaman-White
This captain may look like a
Disney princess, but just wait
until she’s on the pitch! Like
a true Scouser she will play
hard to the end or at least
until the lights come on in
metric.
Lidewij Gossink
Representing for L1s hockey
freshers, this Dutch transfer
has been running rings
around everyone. No one
can catch this girl, no matter
how hard the RSM boys have
tried!
