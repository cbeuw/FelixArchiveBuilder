n Saturday,
the 11th
of
February,
more than
600 runners
from
universities across the UK,
Netherlands and Sweden
took part in the 69th
Annual
Hyde Park Relays, hosted
by Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics Club.
Men’s and mixed teams were
made up of six runners and
women’s teams of four, with
each runner completing a
five-kilometre lap around the
east side of Hyde Park.
Imperial College students,
staff and alumni from across
all faculties were kept
company by teams from Cam-
bridge, Oxford, Portsmouth,
Reading, UCL, LSE, King’s
College, St George’s and
more.
At 2pm sharp, the relays
were set underway by a
cheap plastic air-horn (the
budget was tight) with the
weather conditions less than
favourable for athletes and
spectators alike; cold winds
and occasional flurries of
snow.
Harry Scriven was first
up for the Imperial Men’s
A team, and jostled with
the lead runners to post an
impressive 16:07 (minutes).
Cambridge led the first leg,
closely followed by Oxford
University & Alumni teams
along with UCL, with many
runners dipping under the
15-minute mark.
Asia Hamdorff took the
Imperial Women’s A team to
a speedy first leg of 19:31,
narrowly behind Oxford and
leaders Cambridge and UCL.
The race moved quickly
along, with hundreds of stu-
dents out on the course, some
sporting a hilarious range
of fancy dress costumes, to
the delight of the spectators:
grandmas, the Avengers,
Pac-Man, and all variety of
onesies were out on display.
Matt Douthwaite was up
next for the Imperial Men’s
A team, putting in a strong
performance to run 16.35,
followed by Club Captain
Will Jones in 18.06. Over in
the women’s race, Hamdorff
handed over to Amy Davila
who finished with an impres-
sive 19.25. The mass of teams
around the bandstand cre-
ated a fantastic atmosphere
with spectators cheering
runners around the length of
the course, and documenting
the occasion with the help
of the all-new exclusive race
Snapchat filter!
The Men’s A team held a
strong position with a great
run by Fergus Johnson, who
completed the lap in just
over 17 minutes and also
organised the excellent
event along with fellow club
member Lewis Jackson. John-
son handed over Greg Jones
(17:38) before the baton was
finally given to Chris Allison,
who ran the fastest Imperial
leg of the day in 15:51. The
Women’s A team also battled
away with great runs from
veterans Jess Prior and Alex
Mundell running 19.44 and
18.44 respectively.
The Men’s B team gave
some very good perfor-
mances with almost all the
team coming home in sub-
18.30, and led by Andre
Gourdon in a nifty 17.41.
Notable runs for other club
teams The Sesh and Boyz
Boyz Boyz were Will Scott
(18:34) and Duncan Ingram
(18:26), both with the fastest
leg for their respective teams.
In the women’s, ICXC WE
SO SXY were led home by
Leanne Lyons in 21:31.
After the excitement of the
relays, the teams headed to
the SCR for the customary
jacket potatoes, prize-giving,
and a chance to warm up.
The Men’s A team placed
a respectable 7th
, with the
teams from Oxford, UCL
and Cambridge proving too
strong on this occasion. The
girls fared better, placing 3rd
overall and winning one of
the coveted engraved relay
baton trophies, behind UCL
and Cambridge.
Many other teams from
Imperial also competed, with
All the Boys pipping Triath-
lon’s Tri-als and Tri-bulations
to the finish line and leading
hall team Wake Me Up
Gabor You Go-Go to top spot
in the internal student cate-
gory. Triathlon tasted victory
in the women’s race however,
with the Tri-hards coming in
less than a minute ahead of
ICSWP Girls 2, followed by
Keith’s Caravan.
The internal student teams
are often noteworthy for
their choice of team names,
with this year’s particularly
witty ones coming from
the Electronic Engineering
department: No Pain No H(f)
and Fast and Fouriers.
In the battle of the halls,
Wake Me Up Gabor You
Go-Go led the way ahead
of Falmouth & Keogh, Pem-
bridge Hall Gents, Parsons
Tigers, and Xenia Wardens.
In the ladies’ race Pembridge
Hall Ladies beat Parsons
Tigresses to the line.
Following this, many of
the runners headed to the
after party in Reynolds Bar
with celebratory drinks for
organisers Lewis Jackson and
Fergus Johnson. This was also
an excellent opportunity for
all involved to get to know
runners from other universi-
ties and dance until the early
hours!
The club would like to say a
massive thank you to them for
all their hard work in ensuring
both the day ran smoothly
and everyone had fun, and
also to the volunteers who
helped throughout the day.
