Imperial students outplayed by
Chandigargh Hockey Academy

players had very little time to recover
from the lack of sleep, however, they
were not going to let this affect their
performance.
Chandigarh Hockey Academy, as
the name suggests, is an academy for
the up-and-coming hockey stars of the
Punjabi region. The Academy provides
full room and board for the players as
well as a free education; all they have
to do in return is train in the morning
and evenings. With all the hours these
athletes put in, it was inevitable that
the standard was going to be high. This
was a fact that Chandigarh knew all
too well and their arrogance knew no
bounds when they decided to put out a
side full of 16-18 year olds.
At 18:00, after the formalities of
meeting various officials, their boys
went out to play our men in the hot
and sweaty Chandigarh Hockey Stadi-
um, which had roughly 400 spectators
ready to watch the match. The Impe-
rial team, running out in their mustard
yellow tops, started off well with some
solid defence and threatening attacks,
however, their attempts were fruitless
and the score remained 0-0 for the first
ten minutes. It was at this point that
the heat and humidity started to af-
fect the Imperial men with substitutes
coming on and fast as they were com-
ing off.
Unfortunately the heat had no af-
fect on the home side who effort-
lessly scored four goals in the space of
ten minutes, despite the best efforts
of Chris Baker-Brian, Chris O’Reilly
and Man of the Match Owen Con-
nick (Charles Murdoch was distinctly
average!)
Eventually Imperial found the faint-
est of weaknesses on the right hand
side of the Chandigarh defense, with
Sachin Jivanji breaking down the right
hand side before crossing it in for Cap-
tain Ewan Quince to score a diving
goal leaving the score at half time 4-1
to the hosts.
The second half didn’t see the best
of starts for Imperial, with Chandigarh
scoring another four goals in the first
ten minutes. To add salt to the already
gaping wound, Captain Ewan Quince
told his team at half time that: “4-1 is
not a bad score, we’re still in it if we
play sensibly for the first ten minutes!”
There was no doubt amongst the Im-
perial squad; the Chandigarh players
were clinical in attack.
Despite their best attempts, Imperial
were unable to penetrate the Chandi-
garh defence, something that left strik-
er Daniel Lundy very frustrated after
not being able to find the back of the
net for the full 60 minutes that he was
on the pitch. With the game reaching
its conclusion, Chandigarh managed to
score three more times leaving the final
score 11-1 to the hosts.
The second match of the night saw a
swarm of mosquitos, flys, bats and all
manner of bugs replace the sweltering
temperatures in the stadium. Despite
this, the ladies, led by Captain Teddy
Middlebrok, went out fighting (both
the bugs and the players) with Emma
Beresford popping up all over the
pitch, something that caught the
attention of a certain 13 year old
Indian boy who wanted her phone
number.The attack of the Chan-
digarh ladies was a vicious as
the men’s, however, goal keep-
er and Man of the Match
Jess Purcell pulled out
some spectacular saves,
as did Suzie Squire who
managed to scrape
the ball away from
her own goal line
from a Chandi-
garh short cor-
ner. Imperial’s
attack performed
admirably with
special mention
going to Katie Cul-
len who played her first
game in seven months.
Despite their best ef-
forts, the Imperial ladies
finished the match without
scoring a single goal and the fi-
nal score being 11-0 to the home
side.
In the early hours of the follow-
ing morning, the touring side got up
for the mixed match, with the push-
back at 07:00. Again Chandigarh dis-
played some tremendous arrogance by
putting out a side full of U13 players,
which led to two-time Twat of the Day
Nick Jones boldly saying: “Is it OK if I
run around all of them and score on
my own?”... He did not! Jones’ massive
ego took a beating when a 10 year old
managed to knock him over on one of

his runs, something that was going to
be the theme of the day. Phil Kloucek
also had a bit of a tommy tumble when
he fell over a Chandigarh player whilst
Kavit Nathwani had a similar fall after
a spectacular swing-and-a-miss.
Other notable incidents included
Douglas Blackie introducing a
small Indian players face to
the astro and then blaming
him for being too small
and also to Charles Mur-
doch whose first touch
on the pitch resulted in
a P-Flick to the home
side, unfortunately goal
keeper Alex Summers
was unable to stop it go-
ing in. In complete con-
trast (and I mean com-
plete!), the Chandigarh
goalkeeper, who was nine
years old and four-foot-
fuck-all tall managed to save
Teddy Middlebrooks P-Flick.
The game itself was actu-
ally an eventful one, with Chris
Baker-Brian and Luke Reynolds
both managing to score for Im-
perial. Unfortunately, this was
not enough and the final score
ended at 5-2 to Chandigarh.
As you can see, the
headlines that appeared
in the Indian newspa-
pers were fairly accurate,
but everyone left India
with their spirits high, especially after
seeing their faces on the sports pages
of a paper which isn’t felix.
