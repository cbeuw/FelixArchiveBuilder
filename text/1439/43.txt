“UT Hockey Academy teams toy with
visitors” said the Hindustan Times,
“[...]humble the guests” said the Chan-
digarh Tribune. The fact of the mat-
ter is that these headlines are actually
quite accurate.
The touring side left early on Tues-
day morning [30.06.2009] from Delhi;
thanks to the work of Edward Lacey,
the Tour Lord (Luke Reynolds) and the
High Chief Wizard of the Fun Police
(Jack Cornish) the group got up early
to catch the 05:50 train to Chandigarh.
To add to the woe of the 40 travellers,
it was decided by the higher powers
that the visitors should experience the
real India and therefore booked the
cheapest train possible. The outcome
of this trip was not surprising: one sto-
len rucksack full of Chris Baker-Brian’s
passport, wallet, phone and camera
and one case of the shits for Jack ‘don’t
buy any food on the train’ Cornish!
After a five-hour journey the visi-
tors arrived at Chandigarh and made
their way to the hotel. With only a few
hours before the games started, the

“Formula One is a Joke. Much akin to
Vince McMahon et al. at WWE.”
Sport and controversy are two things
that never seem to escape each other.
However when controversy overshad-
ows the competitive spirit one must
ask questions whether the sport can be
taken seriously anymore.
First off let me not offer an apology
to those of you who love Formula One
(F1) to bits, this isn’t a criticism of you,
even though you waste your weekend
waking up at stupid o’clock to watch
the interminable ordeal of races which
have more excitement after the race
than during. This behaviour reminds
me of my pre-pubescent years watch-
ing WWF (now WWE) pay-per-view
events, on channel 4, on a too early
Monday morning. But more on that
‘sports entertainment’ show later.
Controversy. McLaren spying on Fer-
rari, McLaren feigning ignorance in or-
der to win more points, Schumacher’s
unsportsmanship years ago, and Bria-
tore’s brief fetish of putting his team’s
championship prospects above that of
the life of one his team members. Just a
selection that instantly pop into mind.
I admit I am not a die-hard F1 fan,
so I shan’t go into detail in any of these
cases, however I do hope I show some
colour into the soiled image of this
once well-respected sport.
World Wrestling Entertainment
(WWE) is a sports entertainment com-
pany specialising in acting professional
wrestling. It is privately controlled by
the McMahon’s, a family who often
make decisions on who should win
the various championships and special
ring matches. Most of the McMahon’s
have taken part in wrestling bouts and
have been former champions in differ-
ent wrestling classes.
Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone.
The clear winner in an informal sur-
vey I carried out a couple of weeks ago
where I asked ‘Who controls or owns
Formula One?’
Not to delve into the personal lives of
either person, but I have never heard
of a sport where two people have a sig-
nificant authority over it. Adding they
will have assumed significant roles
in the managing of F1 for over two-
decades after Mosley steps down his
role as the president of the Fédération
Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)
later this year. This brings about a lack
of innovation in the management of
the ‘sport’ and provides an environ-
ment where significant reliance on
engineers and team bosses to provide
this innovation, whether that be legally
or illegally.
The beauty of Formula One of the
past was the fact that it was unadulter-
ated. Pure. And dare I say it, danger-
ous. Though I appreciate the leaps and
bounds F1 has made in terms of pro-
tecting their drivers, nowadays every
fortnight I half expect there to be an-
other scandal when reading the back
pages of Monday morning’s papers.
I for one do not take notice of the re-
sults. Unlucky for Button, this is prob-
ably the worst year to win the champi-
onship as it will more likely than not be
overshadowed by this year’s escapades
of certain constructors.
To conclude, though the engineers
and drivers have every intention of
playing the sport as it should, the man-
agement of Formula One is a joke.
Much akin to Vince McMahon et al. at
WWE. Perhaps if F1 changed it status
to a light entertainment show, I would
enjoy it as much I used to love WWE.
