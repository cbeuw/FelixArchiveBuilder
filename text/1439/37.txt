I don’t feel
sprightly

onsidering how bad I feel
now, I am going to say that
last night was a good night.
It was the ACC freshers’
party and it really got out of hand. A
few beers with the freshers turned into
pints of gin and tonic, and falling asleep
on three busses trying to get home. As
I said, good night. However I am a lit-
tle bemused as to how the whole of my
body hurts, and how I have managed
to spend every penny in my wallet. Lit-
erally every single penny. This is not
the first time it has happened either.
How does that happen? I am under the
impression that when a bit smashed I
manage to barter a pint of Fosters for
£1.86 because that’s all I have left. Ei-
ther that or I just lose it.
Anyway, whilst on the subject of
drink, I met a Scottish pissed bloke
on a bus over the summer. I am sure
we have all been in a similar situation
as every bus appears to have recruited
their own late night pissed bloke, but
this one was different. I tried my best
to ignore him, and even used the tried
and testes nod-and-smile method.
However I soon realised that he was
hilarious. Never before in my life have
I met someone who has the ability to
talk so knowledgeably on a subject that
he clearly have no clue about. Not even
a taxi driver. In the journey home, he
told me about the ‘horses putting their
tails over the wall and fucking shitting’
and about the ‘fucking huge gun pal’
in Chelsea barracks. We also touched
upon the subject of the Albert Hall and
‘its fucking shit sound’ and offered me
an insight into how to fix it.
After a while he waved a bottle at
me and asked ‘you want some of this
pal? Fucking brilliant.’ I told him that
no, I didn’t, especially as it looked like
medicine. To this he laughed, and told
me that it was in fact medicine. I very
much doubt that he could produce a
prescription if asked. He then went on
to shouted at some Americans com-
ing up the stairs, assuring them ‘that
I don’t care if you’re a fucking yank,
we’re all friends on this fucking bus.’
Followed by a heavily accented version
of The Beatles’ Hey Jude. It wasn’t very
good.
So, if you happen to be on a bus and
a pissed Scottish bloke starts to tell you
about the world whilst offering you
medicine, he’s actually very amusing!0

2. Reduced:
I don’t know whether it is solely
Imperial students who like the
reduced section of Tescos, or all
students... but we do love a good
bargain. Before now I have come
home with a mushroom risotto de-
spite the fact that I don’t like mush-
rooms, or risotto for that matter.
But it was reduced so my head told
my hand that I did, ergo I should
but it. I ended up throwing it in the
bin after one mouthful.
However there is no better feel-
ing than going to the shops to buy
your dinner and picking it up for
‘special price’. soon you freezer will
become stocked with all kinds of
exotic foodstuffs that you will never
be able to eat due to elongated de-
frosting times. Regardless of this
fact you will still feel it necessary to
continue in your one man quest to
personally rid you local supermar-
ket of all its almost-gone-off food.
Yes, they’re reduced!
