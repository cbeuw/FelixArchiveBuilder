“Disguised as an
Iranian scientist,
Roger Moore is able
to bluff his way into
the underground
nuclear facility. ”
Y
ou will often hear it said
— usually, I might add, by
those people who believe
that the Inuit have twenty
different words for 'snow'
and regard the prefix 'apparently' as
an acceptable substitute for rational
thought — that the truth is stranger
than fiction. Fortunately our own lan-
guage has been blessed with more than
twenty words for 'rubbish', allowing
me to correctly characterise that ex-
pression as being a mixture of garbage,
tripe, balderdash, tommyrot, hogwash,
gibberish, bunkum, claptrap and ba-
loney, combined with liberal doses of
flimflam, horsefeathers, twaddle, pop-
pycock, bilge, hooey, bollocks, piffle,
trash, nonsense and drivel.
The real world frequently is so
breathtaking, so beautiful and so bi-
zarre as to rival the most twisted im-
agination, and the truth would make
for strange and compelling fiction. But
that is all. The platypus may be a cu-
rious and remarkable creature, but I
will bet you a lifetime's supply of insect
repellent that Gregor Samsa's meta-
morphosis into a cockroach is stranger
still. If Man can be rendered speechless
at the sight of a lush English meadow
after a rainstorm, you might as well
remove his larynx altogether if a white
rabbit hops into view who knows how
to read a pocket watch.
But on some rare occasions, when
Jupiter sees fit to rise in Capricorn
and Taurus does unspeakable things to
Uranus, reality goes one better. To the
sound of Ian Fleming and Alistair Ma-
cLean kicking themselves from beyond
the grave, the Telegraph published
a story earlier this week to rival any
published work of espionage or politi-
cal intrigue. It seems that Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, the well-known anti-
Zionist, anti-Semite and antiquated
autocrat may have been born Jewish.
How perfect. How impossibly, how
incredibly, how unfathomably perfect.
You can almost picture the climactic
scenes in the James Bond movie. Dis-
guised as an Iranian nuclear scientist,
Roger Moore is able to bluff his way
through enough physics to penetrate
the heart of the country's secret un-
derground reactor. Once inside, he
sabotages the moderator and drives a
fuel rod through the chief engineer's
spine. As he races for the exit, Marjan
al-Karakter, the beautiful UN diplomat
and CIA double-agent, beckons to our
hero from a side door. As he approach-
es, the Revolutionary Guard surrounds
him and the sultry and treacherous
Marjan leads her prisoner to the Presi-
dential bunker.
Our hero enters the August Pres-
ence with a quivering jowl and a barely
perceptible raised eyebrow. He is faced
with the back of a revolving armchair,
underneath which two tiny feet swing
half a metre in the air. A complicated
array of controls lines the walls, and a
very simple array of guns points at his
chest.
"Ah, Mr. Bond:" oozes the voice from
behind the chair. "How good of you to
join us. Your timing is impeccable. All
that remains for my plan to be com-
plete is for that button to be pressed. A
nuclear missile of unprecedented pow-
er and efficiency will come out of the
ground beneath our feet and soar into
the night sky. And soon, very soon, it
will land. And so the Zionist cancer
will be pushed into the sea, and the
world will once more be pure."
"So why do you need me?" drawls our
hero as the camera shows his hands
reaching for his supersonic tiepin.
"I would love to press that button
myself, Mr Bond," says the tiny man
as the chair begins to swivel. "But you
see, it's Friday night, and my religion
forbids me from activating machinery
on the Sabbath."
The news that the President of Iran
may be Jewish is sure to have wide-
spread repercussions throughout the
Jewish world. If only because there is
now another handsome and power-
ful Jewish man who may be interested
in a Jewish wife. And darlings, he's an
engineer.
In the days since the Telegraph ran
with their story the Guardian has
taken it upon themselves to snuff out
one of the most promising and enter-
taining news stories of the year. For a
short while it was all too believable.
Ahmadinejad's reasons for claiming a
global Zionist conspiracy would have
been crystal clear: even his own coun-
try might be run by a Jew.
Old Hand wrings his younger brother
“I was worried that
Freshers’ Week
was going to be my
most exciting week
at university. How
wrong I was.”
F
uck me I’m old.
For a while now, I have
come into College for 08:30,
buy my morning coffee – a
double espresso – and cr-
oissant from the Junior Common
Room, go to my office and check my
emails. I tend to leave all my Col-
lege work at College, that includes all
emails, which means the evenings are
free for relaxation, socialising with my
housemates and, of course, Fifa 09 on
the Playstation 3. I’ll admit it now, I’m
not very good at the old Fifa, Mario
Kart on the Wii is more my sort of
thing, but the main reason I was never
good at Fifa was simply because my
youngest brother used to beat the crap
out of me on that. That was eight years
ago when I was 16 and my little brother
was ten!
This last week, however, as I got off
the bus and made my way to College,
I noticed that things were a little dif-
ferent. For a start I have to queue in
the JCR for my coffee, the croissants
seem to have all been eaten and all
I’m left with is a crappy, little, stale
piece of Danish that no one wants to
eat because, let’s face it, they taste like
[qwerty]. Even on my way to the of-
fice things are different; the walk is no
longer a solo one, the silence replaced
with a mixture of voices from so many
races and backgrounds, and the corri-
dors packed with eager eyed faces all
preparing themselves for their first day
at university. I look at these faces, and
all I can see is my youngest brother, the
same young brother who dominated
me on the Fifa field and regularly hu-
miliated me with 5-0 and above beat-
ings. That’s when I realised; fuck me
I’m old!
I spoke to my brother later that
week, mainly to see how things were
going, but also to see how he was en-
joying Freshers’ Week. As expected, he
replied with one word. “Messy,” said
my brother down the phone, clearly
suffering with a hangover from the
night before. Not really a big surprise
if you ask me.
“But at least I don’t have to go the
all these introductory lectures, or lec-
tures at all for that matter” he said as
someone was having a go at him on the
other end for being so cocky. I laughed
back and told him that it served him
right. I asked how his mates were cop-
ing and if they were looking forward to
the year ahead. “No!” was the reply I
got. Apparently, they were all worried
that Freshers’ Week was the only bit
of fun they were going to have all year
as they were going to spend the rest of
the year working and not having a lot
of time to relax.
Thinking back to my first week, I felt
the same. I was worried that Freshers’
Week was going to be one of the most
exciting weeks during my time at uni-
versity, how wrong I was. Yes, Fresh-
ers’ Week was fun (and boy do I have
a story for you guys about what hap-
pened to me at my Mingle — but we’ll
save that for next week) but it was by
no means the only fun week I had. The
workload was demanding, the hours
were long, we even had a Maths test in
the first week which didn’t help, but I
still managed to find time to enjoy my-
self and get a good degree.
And you can do it too. This is not
just aimed at the freshers out there, the
same will apply to second, third and
even fourth years. If you ever needed
any proof, a very good friend of mine
only became the social animal that he
is today in his third year. We dragged
him out with us, had fun, studied hard
and he still came out with a 1st, and
not any sort of 1st, top of the year 1st.
Today, he is in America doing a PhD.
It is possible, it can be done and it
has been done and you could do the
same. The proof, my dear readers, is in
the writing. So tune in next week and
I’ll tell you what we got up to at our
Freshers’ Mingle.
