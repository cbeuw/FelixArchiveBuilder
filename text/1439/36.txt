We all know that the rich are all ge-
netically and morally superior to mere
plebs (that’s YOU btw). So I’ll forgive
you for being excited at the thought
that a whole swarm of them were due
to congeal at Eastside, known to lo-
cal residents as Wankside (that’s the
least funny joke you’ve ever told, get a
life - Ed).
The College was understandably hop-
ing that the £64 million project would
increase the quality of Imperial stu-
dents, good breeding as they say, is
everything. With rooms costing over
£200 per week, there was some justifi-
cation to this hope.
Unfortunately those hopes have
turned out to have been premature and
unfounded.
An in-depth 20 minute Hangman
investigation (by me) has discovered
that many of Eastside’s new residents
are not in fact from the upper crust of
society, some even had grandparents

A
s I forced a smile and
pretended to give a shit
about starving children
in some deprived coun-
try half-way across the
world, I thought to myself: ‘Why? Why
have I come here again?’
To remind myself that rugby players
enjoy ‘smashing poon’? To consume two
hundred Starbursts at the cost of having
two hundred mailing lists to unsubscribe
to? To stand between ‘Islam soc’ and
‘Christian soc’ and feel immense disap-
pointment at the amicable atmosphere?
Perhaps I’m being overly negative.
Oh, wait a second, I’m not. I had to
endure a half hour lecture about soft-
ware society - yeah, software society.
‘Aw bless, No-one is signing up to their
C++ wankfest, I guess I could put a
fake name down- Shit! Eye contact!
OH GOD! She’s talking to me! She’s
Eastern European; I can’t understand
anything she’s saying! Just nod and
agree, nod and agree...’
I thought that’s how my life was
to end; I was going to nod and agree
myself to death. Thank god for my
unbeatable escape tactic. I just hope no-
one notices a missing member of soft-
ware society, or finds my suitcase and
hacksaw.
And where is BNP soc? There is
nothing better than a cup of tea, a bis-
cuit and two teaspoons of casual raci-
sim. I’m not advocating any of their
policies, it’s just that I now find the
BNP protestors more annoying than
the BNP. ‘Did you watch BBC question
time last night?’ ‘Yeah, Nick Griffin
turned me into a racist.’ ‘Yeah, me too!’
After moving to a slightly rougher
area of London, I thought it might be
sensible to learn self-defence. Those
guys walking around in cloaks, wield-
ing sticks looked pretty threatening,
but that’s because they had a stick
and I didn’t. If I had a gun, or a sword,
those stick wizards would be fucked!
Imperial College Freshers’ Fair is bur-
dened with the tag, ‘Imperial College,’
which translates to most others as ‘I’m
a twat!’ So essentially it doesn’t matter
what society you join; you’ll never be
cool. ‘Cool’ probably isn’t even a cool
word anymore. Welcome to Imperial!

I went over to Eastside halls to meet
the new residents and what I found
was frankly shocking and repulsive.

fabulous night out with London’s good
and great, one student responded
“Well yeh, maybe on Monday night, if
we get there early it’s cheaper entry”.
Simply depressing.
I carried on through the halls before
stumbling on a group of girls (I know,
weird right?) chatting in their kitchen.
They had just been back from a
shopping trip, Asda bags littered the
kitchen. “I would shop at Wholefoods
coz it’s like y’know expensive an yeh
but Asda just FEELS better y’know?”
No, I have no idea what you’re talking
about. I left them before retching in the
hallway as they began discussing a trip
up to Newcastle for a mates hen party.
The only semblence of civilization
in Chavside (no sorry, that’s the least
funny joke you’ve ever told - Ed) (stop
editing my section you chav - Hang-
man Ed), was an Arab student called
Rashid who rents an entire corridor in
the halls. He knew what Villebrequin
is and his dad owns like every camel in
Jordan. His maid’s hot and totally over
16 I swear...
Guy: “Do you watch Star Trek?”
Girl: “Yeah, I loved the film!”
Guy: “Oh, I meant the series...”
awkward silence
Guy: “Hi, my name’s Mohammed”
Girl: “Cool! So’s my teddy!”
awkward silence
Girl: “How many As did you get?
Guy: “Oh, I got 2As and a B”
awkward silence
Guy: “You have that monthly thing
right?”
Girl: “errr...”
awkward silence
Guy: “You’ve that monthly thing
right?”
Different Girl: “Yeah! Do you wanna
see?”
awkward silence
Guy: “How many level 80’s do you
have on WoW?
Girl: “What’s WoW?
awkward silence
Guy: “I hate these girls, it’s so much
better chatting with guys”
Dude: “Yeah, I agree”
Guy: “One girl didn’t even know what
WoW was”
Dude: “Yeah... crazy... you’re hot...”
awkward silence
Guy: “Hi my name’s Chris”
Dude: “Cool, what’s your real name?”
Guy: “Toh Kok-wai”
Dude: “lol...”
awkward silence
Girl: “This place is such a shithole,
these guys are jerks”
Lass: “I know, this is so lame”
Girl: “Stop touching my hand”
awkward silence
Guy: Hey, I’m doing maths and com-
puting, what do you do?
Girl: It’s quicker to say ‘I’m a virgin’
awkward silence
Guy: “Do you want to come back to
mine?”
Girl: “I’m twelve and what is this?”

Guy: “Hello”
Dude: “Hi”

AWKWARD!
