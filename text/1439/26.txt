W
ould you like
to write for us?
Wouldn’t it be a
dream come true?
Living the journal-
istic dream, telling others your opin-
ion on games while proclaiming to all
around that you write about games and
are really knowledgeable and stuff.
Well, fuck knows where you’re going
to get that from. But if you fancy jotting
some words down for us, that’d be just
dandy. We’re looking for enthusiastic
gamers to write for our section — you
don’t need to be a perfect writer to do
it! You just need to love the thing you’re
writing about, and as long as you can
give us that, we’re really interested in
publishing you.
felix Games is looking for a variety of
articles this year, ranging from weekly
news roundups to columns with a
twist, as well as the usual dose of news,
features and the occasional review. We

H
ey folks, and welcome
(unless you’re a fresh-
er, in which case I’ve
beaten this schtick to
death already) to felix
and another year of games coverage.
While the folks at Another Castle bea-
ver away to bring you a glossy, sexy-sex
edition of their termly games maga-
zine, we’ll be doing our very best to get
you informed and entertained about
that hobby you don’t like telling people
you meet about.
I’ve been following the Tim Langdell
story this week as it takes another in-
teresting, and probably its final, turn.
For those who aren’t aware, Langdell
appeared to be bullying companies
and individuals who had used the word
“Edge” in their product title, claiming
he held the copyright to this term.
It came to the attention of the wider
games community when a highly-an-
ticipated iPhone game got taken out
of the Apple store after a claim filed
against it by Langdell. They backed
off, not having the legal werewithal to
challenge him for his ludicrous claims
(Langdell himself has not actively used
the trademark for over a decade, but
has made plenty of claims) but the me-
dia picked it up and spread it around.
A few small communities began fol-
lowing the story, documenting it and
exposing some of the more ridiculous
accusations being made. But nothing
would have come of it, I don’t think,
had Langdell not made a fatally stupid
error - goading Electronic Arts into
action by making a claim against their
stunningly beautiful first-person plat-
former, Mirror’s Edge.
Anyone who’s looking to take EA
on has balls, but they also have a lot
of stupidity balancing it out. Recently,
EA very quietly submitted a docu-
ment petitioning for the removal of all
trademark claims made by Langdell,
including those he did not attempt to
use against them. In one fell swoop,
EA have cut through everything
Langdell has and will now presumably
be putting their full legal and financial
weight behind getting it through. It’s
quite astounding.
The reason why I like this story is be-
cause it shows how gaming is growing,
growing enough to produce genuine
villains, as well as heroes. Langdell is
an utter c**t, harassing journalists, de-
velopers and gamers themselves when-
ever he found himself being questioned
or investigated. Ultimately, he hasn’t a
leg to stand on, but he knows he can
manipulate and scare people.
But in the end, the truth won out,
and that’s even nicer to see. The fact
that EA, typically the devil of the gam-
ing world, stepped in to deal the kill-
ing blow was particularly interesting.
It might be a bit far-fetched to think it,
but I like to imagine a small smirk on
Games Editorette
That was not
journalism
W
elcome. I’ll be edit-
ing a bit here and
there, mainly to an-
tagonise Mike. For
instance, this week
his picture is a girl. This is funny! It’s
funny because he’s a girl.
Anyway. Want to know what I’ve
been playing this week? Well too bad,
because I’ve been playing Jedi Acad-
emy too much to write about it. Oh
right, that. Yeah. LucasArts, in a rare
moment of sanity, put more of their
games up so they could be paid mon-
ey. This ingenious business proposal
allows you to play some of the best
games ever made for cheap. Jedi Acad-
emy is not one of these.
However, it is one of those games you
canplayoverandoveragainsaying:‘How
have I missed this?” Because it’s superb.
It’s not merely that they give you a light-
saber from the start of the game, it’s the
whole feel. By the time you’re well into
the game, your force powers are easy to
use and very satisfying. The game knows
what you want to do, so it throws more
and more weak enemies at you, allowing
you to experience challenges in the most
enjoyable way possible – seeing the force
push throw six enemies onto their backs,
for instance, or mind-tricking a rocket-
launcher into nuking his allies.
It’s so much fun, I’ve completely
missed the Left4Dead update which
I really should’ve been doing on a
nightly basis. Not to worry, though, as
Left4Dead2 is just on the horizon. Grab
the 4-pack with a few mates, because it
brings the digital download price down
to £20, with free early access to the demo
and a baseball bat in-game. Hugely
worth it, provided you’re not capped for
downloads.
This week, I’m going to try and get
back into GTA4. But a little more light-
sabering is in order. I’ve found a cheat
that enables limb removal. I love games.

Tune in next time to see if our developer has managed to rival Spelunky. Our guess is not, though. Sorry, man.
Diary of a Games Dev
I
am going to make some games.
Not big games. Not good games.
But it’s high time I stopped
moaning about Bioshock’s ter-
rible level design and starteed
getting out there and getting my hands
dirty. So I’m going to make some
games. And tell you about it.
Spelunky is what pushed me to do
it. Derek Yu’s sublime platformer was
created with a blend of sexy python
programming (www.python.org) and
the slightly less sexy Game Maker pro-
gram (www.yoyogames.com/make), an
application that he’s seemingly pushed
to its very limits in order to produce
his game.
It’s inspiring mostly because it’s so
simple, but it uses one single clever
idea to underpin some great gameplay.
The randomness the levels feels right,
it feels good. It’s not true randomness,
the levels have basic templates which
are embellished with details. And it’s
that that gives off such a lovely aura of
playability.
However, I won’t be starting off that
big just yet. The first stop on my tour
of gaming creation is the extremely
super-simple realm of the text adven-
ture. I say super-simple not because it
is, but just because it pisses off people
who like making and playing them. In
actual fact, interactive fiction is hugely
hard to design and make, but I’m really
interested in doing one.
This is partly because I played Make
It Good this summer (www.playthisth-
ing.com/make-it-good) which is a
film noir text adventure where you’re
sent to investigate a murder as a po-
lice detective. It’s rendered so richly,
with so many lovely and unexpected
gaming touches, that it’s a joy to play.
The crime is intricately written to al-
low people to unpick it using their own

intelligence, with a time limit to make
sure you don’t spend too long solving
it the first time around. I’ve failed to
solve the crime three times now, with
a fourth run waiting for me next week.
But it’s the logic, the common sense
that wraps the whole thing up and real-
ly sells it. It doesn’t feel stupid or badly
designed. I’d like to do something like
that.
I’ve downloaded Inform 7 (www.in-
form7.com) which seems to be a nice
and friendly way to write these things.
It uses natural language to describe
the world and how it works, including
the definition of language rules. This
makes it much more approachable to
someone like me, who’s a messy twit
when it comes to laying stuff out.
I’ll let you know how I get along, and
hopefully I’ll have something playable
for you all soon! Until then, take a look
at Make It Good. It’s superb.
Fancy writing for us?
Who wouldn’t? We’re manly and stuff. Also; really sexy.
want to know what makes you tick,
what you love about gaming,
because that’s the kind of
passion that makes for good
reading.
Why on God’s Earth
would you want to do
such a thing? Well, you
might put it on your CV
— past writers for felix
have gone on to great
things; it’s a fantastic
opportunity to meet
new people, network
with members of the
games press and the
wider industry itself.
Former felix editor
Owain Bennallack went
on to edit Develop maga-
zine as well as Edge Magazine
and co-create Pocket Gamer,
and we’ve had plenty of
other journalists go on to
great things in other fields of journal-
ism. We’ve met Peter Molyneux, David
Braben, the Introversion folks, Media
Molecule and more.
If you’d like to write for us,
drop us an email at games.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. We
weren’t at Fresher’s Fair, but
we do hope you came and
took a look at felix anyway
and signed up.
If you’ve sent us an email
and we’ve been too lazy
to reply, you can get writ-
ing straight away. We’re
looking for entries to our
new Tonight, felix... feature, which
requires about 600 words on a char-
acter you love. Alternatively, you can
send anything you’ve been working
on, but bear in mind that we need
a good wordcount to fill a page
comfortably.
