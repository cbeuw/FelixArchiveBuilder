SONS
SIGH NO MORE
ISLAND
RECORDS
Folksters Mumford & Sons have been
spearheading the London modern folk
scene with the likes of Laura Marling
and Johnny Flynns for quite some time
now, but while their peers have found
record deals and Mercury prizes, it’s
only now that they’ve been given the
opportunity to apply their talent for
tugging and pulling apart the heart-
strings in album form.
Lyrically this record is mind-blowing.
The band refuse to underestimate their
listeners and weave imaginative meta-
phor, inventive hyperbole and a little
bit of Shakespeare to convey a power-
ful sense of lost love.
The music is by no means ‘sappy’ how-
ever, they combine some old-fashioned
banjo with thumping double-bass and
such huge drums that one wonders if
the drummer might take steroids. The
record is ultimately has an accessibility
that leaves mainstream success all but
inevitable. - Kadhim Shubber
ALBUM
PR have been pushing The Saturdays
like an expectant mother who’s three
weeks overdue. I don’t want to be
mean so I’ll just say that whether or not
this single sells a lot of copies or not,
it’s just not interesting music, not at all.
- Kadhim Shubber
Forget Marilyn Manson, it’s music like
this that makes me want to blow up
a school, so that none of the children
ever grow up to make music like this.
Anyone who ever listens to this out of
choice is not human. They are a rep-
tilian shape shifter and should you en-
counter one, I’m pretty sure it is within
the law, if not required by law, to kill
them immediately.
The lyrics don’t even make sense:
“forever is over”? what does that even
mean? Did you just find words with
similar letters in them and put them
together? This sounds like a sketch
show parody of how bad pop music is.

EMI
SINGLE
In my day drum & bass music was
about raving and skanking and waiting
for the bass to drop. With this single
Chase & Status have decided that it’s
now about pop songs with an over-
used beat. It doesn’t work and if it’s the
shape of things to come then I’ll kill
myself. - Kadhim Shubber

If the Saturdays are the epitome of
everything bad about music right now,
this song is the epitome of what is good
about music right now. When I listen
to this I think of a future utopia where
hip hop and electro and indie all merge
together like the Power Rangers mega-
zord of modern music. - Alex Ashford

onfidence is half the game
and The Boxer Rebellion
were overflowing with it.
They walked on stage with
an attitude that said “We know how
fucking good our material is, and we’re
going to make you love every second
of it”.
They didn’t fail to deliver, with every
song the cheering simply grew louder
and by the end of the gig most fans had
their hands permanently in the air. The
mix of mainly 30+ lads and lasses were
held firmly under the spell of front-
man Nathan Nicholson’s (“well fit” ac-
cording to my companion) impressive
vocals. He switched seamlessly from
ghostly falsetto during “Flashing Red
Light Means Go” to screaming lunatic
as he dived over the barrier to party
with fans for “Watermelon”. Despite
the belting delivery, he made it look
like a walk in the park (although his
sweat drenched shirt gave the game
away. He was outdone by guitarist
Todd Howe who genuinely had sweat
dripping from his fingertips).
It’s often been said that the band
writes music designed for large arenas
and this sentiment exactly sums up the
sensation of hearing them perform live.
The guitar, drums and vocals seem to
hang in the air above you giving the im-
pression, even in a small venue like the
Garage, that they’re playing to a packed
Wembley Arena. The impact is that

you’re left with the sensation of the epic.
Luckily this was tempered to a cer-
tain extent, in part by the bands exu-
berance and charisma but also by the
increased intimacy of their new mate-
rial from album Union as opposed to
their 2005 debut EXITS.
In short, armed with some sweet
material, The Boxer Rebellion blew the
crowd away. - Kadhim Shubber

here is an old adage that says;
‘if you speak, they will listen.’
This did not hold true for
Noah and the Whale, who
grew increasingly frustrated as a signif-
icant section of the audience privately
conversed. ‘You can talk about the gig
afterwards,’ urges frontman Charlie
Fink. Would it be cynical to suggest
that an enthralling performance would
remedy this situation? Quite possibly,
but nonetheless Noah and the Whale
hit somewhat wide of the mark this
evening, often drifting into monotony
to the point of being disinteresting. It
probably doesn’t help that female ac-
companiment has now been deemed
surplus to demands, which would
often add a much needed contrast to
Fink’s often invariant vocals.
Respite is redeemed within the bands
most jaunty, jangley songs such as Jo-
casta and 5 Years Time. When the lat-
ter begins, naturally the talking trans-
forms into singing as sections of the
crowd remember why they attended
this evening. This seemed to be a stage
too big for this band to fill, resulting in
a stagnant atmosphere where the most
crowd participation was in the form of
hissed shushes.
As far as the performance goes,
there was little to be overwhelmed by.
They felt like a band running through
the motions, with the exception of the
violinist trying to shred his bow during
a prolonged middle eight. Fink occa-
sionally stepped away from the micro-

phone and hunched over his guitar, as
if he couldn’t decide between rock or
twee.
To be fair to them, when they write a
decent pop song, it really works. Their
ballads are also not bad but there seems
to be a real lack of depth and variation
in their repertoire which seems to be
the prime culprit to not maintaining
the crowds attention.
