Mozart Hushed as Royal Albert
Hall welcomes unsigned bands
Pop star? No
thanks.
I
really can’t write this column
about what’s going on in music
right now, having been away
from the real world all summer,
travelling through the backwa-
ters of India, where record shops bare-
ly exist and the only CDs people own
are psytrance and goa leftovers from
LSD-fried, enlightment-seeking hip-
pies. I have no idea what is happening
in music right now, and in all honesty I
don’t mind at all.
I had the rare pleasure, a few days
ago, of seeing my friend Terry who
had come over from New York to DJ
and drum in London. We ended up
in that weird dive of a bar, the 333 in
Shoreditch. While they were playing
the Major Lazer track “Pon de floor”
he quitely mentioned, “this is me
drumming”. How cool is that? That is
pretty cool. That is so cool. I think I
told every single person I encountered
for the next few days about how cool I
thought that was.
But it probably isn’t very cool if you
are the person saying it. If anything
you would probably be bored of peo-
ple telling you how cool it is. So many
boys pick up guitars and dream of the
day their band makes it big, the next
Libertines, the next Rolling Stones, the
next Sonic Youth. But what if you are,
would it be cool then? Look at Pete
Doherty, if you can bear to look at his
sweaty-cheese-left-out-of-the-fridge
face. All the sadness of his life choices
began with being in a band that made
it big. Maybe the same would have
happened to him if he had taken an-
other path, but I doubt it.
I don’t think I could ever be a musi-
cian (not that I have one thimble-full of
the talent required anyway). If I talk to
anyone about music, there are always
a generous handful of musicians that
people will say “I fucking hate _____”
about. Why? Because they make
music you don’t enjoy? People say,
“oh, I hate that La Roux! She says she
doesn’t like Lady Gaga” and “Lily Allen
is a bitch! Did you hear what she said
about Girls Aloud?”. For some reason,
to make music and not be venomously
hated by large proportions of people
you have never met, you have to avoid
having an opinion on anything, and
even then maybe you would be called
boring. Artists get bottled at festivals.
They are picked apart and chewed
up and judged like no-one else in any
other field, except perhaps Hollywood
actors. Only unlike Hollywood actors,
they don’t really make any money, they
live on freebies.
Being a rock/pop/rap star is like a
modern equivalent of the American
Dream. A fantasy that will never live
up to it’s promise. Perhaps I’m pretty
cynical and jaded. I would ask my
American friend what he thinks but
he’s playing a festival in Beijing with
Buzzcocks, partying in the swanki-
est hotels and waking up in beds with
anonymous girls. Hmm. Maybe it’s
not too bad after all.

Perhaps in Denmark ‘90s pop mu-
sic didn’t happen, because this music
sounds like a Gina G b-side, it’s light
and frothy but it doesn’t have that “ooh
ahh” that Gina G had. On the one
hand I love ‘90s pop music and I hope
this is a sign that music might go back
to making pop classics like “get into
the groove”, but I fear this song already
sounds like it belongs in the bargin bin
at a petrol station. - Alex Ashford
A
gig venue for indepedent
artists and unsigned bands?
In South Kensington, at the
Royal Albert Hall? I didn’t
believe it either, this had to be seen to
be believed.
As I walked to the recently refur-
bished Elgar Room (in the past used
by The Central School of Speech
and Drama to train actors such as
Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Judi Dench
and Harold Pinter) it was a little diffi-
cult to imagine skinny jeaned indie kids
traipsing through the building. But also
pretty exciting. In a venue that usually
plays host to dinner jackets and gowns,
a few hoodies and checked shirts walk-
ing around is almost subversive.
The Hush nights have been around for
a while but it’s only now that the Elgar
Room has been specifically converted
for gigs. In the past artists such as John-
ny Flynn, Little Boots and Cocknbullkid
have been intruders in a faux-Victorian
room but now with past greats such as
Jimi Hendrix adorning the walls and an
ultra-low stage, this is now a truly inti-
mate venue for unknown, up and com-
ing artists.

This is lovely, floaty, folky, indie music,
with a singer that sounds a bit like An-
thony from Anthony & the Johnsons /
Hercules and Love Affair. The lyrics
are a bit weird, “scaring the oldies into
their dressing gowns/as the dripping
dogs howl”? But it’s good. I like it. You
might too. - Alex Ashford
If you like music with lots of sweep-
ing guitars and some tinkling pianos
and heartfelt vocals, but Radiohead
are a bit depressing/weird for you, you
might like this. The lyrics are a bit
rubbish but I think this sort of music
is for boys who will hear it on Radio 1
in their car and aren’t likely to listen to
the lyrics anyway. - Alex Ashford

ALBUM
‘At the Bottom’ is the first single from
Brand New’s new album, Daisy. Re-
leased digitally a month prior to Daisy,
the New York band continues to mu-
sically lurch ahead of their peers with
each album. However, ‘At the Bottom’
indicates a progression from 2006’s
‘Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me’
less drastic than those between previ-
ous LPs.
Though the pop-punk roots of old
have truly decayed with the release of
‘At the Bottom’, the emotion of their
tracks is still fruitfully evident in
the screaming chants of Jesse Lacey
overlaying the measured whines of
guitars.
‘At the Bottom’ just falls short of the
tag of an impressive first single from
their new album, but it is sure to lead
a steady flow of quality singles in the
next year; it will please fans but will not
catch the casual listeners’ attention. -

Apparently Japanese Voyeurs (not
actually Japanese at all) make music
about “infantile fantasies, crushing
disappointments and sexual repres-
sion”. This song seems to have a bit of
all 3 and if you can get past the slightly
strange vocals and lyrics, it’s a fairly
solid piece of noise rock.

It’s fairly promising, but unfortunately
this piece of Scottish post-hardcore
never really goes anywhere. Flood of
Red are worth a listen if you’re hard-
core keano, but there isn’t really much
there to stand out above some of the
more established groups.

They’re back after 15 years without an
album with a new singer, this album is
very good. It’s got enough of the old
style AIC crunch but does enough to
sound current. Most importantly Du-
vall’s vocals offer a fitting replacement
to the late great Layne Staley without
sounding derivative. Superb.

I hoped a band called “Animal King-
dom” might sound like Animal Col-
lective covering the Lion King sound-
track, but sadly this sounds like a blend
of all the indie/folk bands around at the
moment. I could see myself enjoying it
in the middle of a playlist but it’s not a
stand out track. - Alex Ashford

It’s true what they say isn’t it? MGMT just don’t have much stage presence...
