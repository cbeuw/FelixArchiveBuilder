What a storm the World Athletics
Championships have caused this year.
Not only did Usain Bolt win both the
100m and 200m world title, but he
did it in style by utterly destroying his
own world record in both races. It was
quite amusing seeing the look on Ty-
son Gay’s face at the end of the race,
the man clearly knew that he had been
beaten good and proper. I believe that
after Bolt’s performance, Gay has now
realised that not only did he finish in
2nd place, he is the 2nd best, i.e. there
are no prospects of him displacing
Bolt. It must be a hard title to digest.
I remember watching the 100m fi-
nal and simply looking at the screen
in sheer disbelief at how quick Bolt
was running down the track. I had the
same reaction when I saw him do the
200m in 19.19s, that’s an average of
roughly 9.09s per 100m.
But Bolt’s performance was not the
only one that caused some heads to
turn in Berlin this year. Out of virtually
nowhere, 18-year-old Caster Semenya
from South Africa turned up and won
the women’s 800m final by nearly 2.5s
and, on top of that, her performance
during the season had improved by
nearly seven seconds. This vast im-
provement in performance led to the
International Association of Athletics
Federations (IAAF), backed up with
tests carried out by the South African
athletics body, asking for a “gender
verification” test before the final race
in Berlin, a decision that has angered
the vast majority.
Rather unsurprisingly people began
to rally around the 18-year-old, includ-
ing the South African athletics chiefs

Crossword No. 1,439
Hello all. In the time-honoured tradi-
tion of such great papers as the Times,
the Telegraph, the Metro and the Lon-
don Lite, we at felix publish a weekly
cryptic crossword to make the sports
section worth reading.
We are currently looking for aspir-
ing crossword setters to write for us as
regularly as they would like. Please get
in touch to sudoku.felix@imperial.
ac.uk if you think that might interest
you.
Until we can force someone to vol-
unteer for the role, however. we will
be publishing puzzles from previous
issues. This week’s product was pub-
lished in last year’s freshers issue, and
resulted in sufficiently few charges of
grievous bodily harm to be worth the
risk of reprinting.
Hopefully the weekly crossword
will help to distract from the pain of
lectures, or at least make them seem
trivial by comparison.
Enjoy the first week of term proper.

the brief gender issue with the current
800m women’s world record holder,
Jarmila Kratochvílová.
With that in mind, I’m sure that
IAAF were relieved to see that initial
tests indicated that Semenya had tes-
tosterone levels that were three times
more than the normal, giving them a
more solid ground for their claim. This
did make me wonder though, what
would happen if she does turn out to
be a man, or more to the point, what
would happen if it turned out she used
to be a man?
The IAAF acknowledge several med-
ical conditions to giving the athlete an
advantage, but still let them partici-
pate, in particular congenital adrenal
hyperplasia. This is a condition in
which the body produces more andro-
gen, a type of male hormone. If a girl
has it, she will usually have normal in-
ternal female reproductive organs, but
may not have periods and may have a
male appearance.
If they find out that she does have
this condition, then everything is fine,
but again, what would happen if she
used to be a man? Would transsexuals
be allowed to compete at all? If they
are allowed to compete, would they
compete in the male or female events?
If they used to be a male, then they
would have male muscles, which are
bigger and more powerful clearly giv-
ing them an advantage. Even if they
take hormone supplements to make
them more female, would there still
not be an elevated level of testoster-
one in their body, levels that are higher
than in a normal female? I’ll leave that
to you dear readers to decide amongst
yourselves wether or not they should
be allowed to compete.
mentality of conforming feminine out-
look within the white race, and that as
long as it does not fall within this race
or starve and paint itself in order to
look like the white race it therefore is
not feminine.”
Personally I’m a little annoyed that
they would use the race card and I
would like to think that the IAAF
didn’t make their decision based on
the physical appearance of Semenya.
