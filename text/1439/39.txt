Cancer
Browsing through your
mates pictures of their
freshers weeks you
notice something very
different; there appear
to be attractive females
in every photo. You look at your new friends - a
midget, a speccy asian geek and a lanky european
guy who says nothing. Get use to a life of
celibracy mate, you won’t be losing your virginity
for a long long time.
Virgo
Today you sit in your
room and cry for three
hours because you can’t
make any friends. Dont
worry little fresher,
theres magical place
called World of Warcraft where it doesn’t matter if
you wear shit clothes, smell of regurgitated faeces
and have no chat. Lock yourself in your room, get
some tissues and never show your mutated face
again.
Gemini
Recession has hit
your family hard and
your mum has sent
to sell the cow. A nice
man trades you it for
some magic powder
that makes you fill happy and light. What thats?
Your falling into a hole? Sorry mate, but you’re
going to no wonderland, just keep staring at
your hands whilst your friends glue you to a
chair. Fail
Pisces
You know that fishy
smell in your room that
you can’t seem to get
rid of, despite having
bleached every square
inch of bleachable
surface you’ve managed to find? Clearly you didn’t
realise that it is actually possible to bleach your
roommate. Mate, you should just set fire to all his
clothes and replace them with several hundred bot-
tles of deodrant. Then set those alight.
Leo
At this week’s LAN
party in Training
Room 1 of the Library,
you encounter a World
of Warcraft character
based on real-life el-
ven Hunter, Ravi Pall. He will beat your bollocks
into a dripping pulp of ball-meat. You lie there in
a pool of blood as a Library assistant screams in
horror at the sight of your raw scrotum. Fail.
Aries
Your penis burns
when you use the
toilet and you swear
your pubic hair is fall-
ing out. Should you
go get one of those
free chlamidia tests? No you twat, you need to
have a sex before you can get a cool disease like
that. You should never have shoved your finger
up your arse before tossing off to hentai porn.
Fail
Scorpio
You’re in one of two
groups of people: the
few lucky bastards that
managed to actually
get inside some slapper
this week, or a cuck-
olded slapper’s boyfriend. What unites the lot
of you, however, is that you all now have herpes.
Mate, I heard it’s definitely the best STI to have
out of all of them anyway. Enjoy!
Libra
Today you pop into
your local Mcdonalds
for a greasy Big Mac.
With no napkins at
hand you wipe your
hands in the guys afro
in front of you. You shit your pants as he slowly
turns around only to be face to face with Moss off
the It Crowd. You walk off relieved as he swears
he’s going to fuck you up on Warcraft. He fuck
well will too.Win.
Taurus
You have unsettling
dreams of Pikachu
breastfeeding her
litter of little Pichus.
Don’t worry, this
recurring nightmare
is typically a precursor to a heightened interest
in gerbil play. Get ready to join the likes of the
great Richard Gere. Mate, there isn’t a feeling
like putting a hamster in a dark place.
Capricorn
Hurrying to make your
next lecture you bump
into a posh looking fella’
.
“Watch where you’re
going mate!” you shout
at him but he decides
not to hear you. “Are you a DEAF CUNT?” you
not so politely inquire. He informs you that he is
in fact deaf before beating the shit out of you with
a hockey stick. Still, you cant help laughing at his
voice. Pint?
Aquarius
This week, you will
arrive at university,
all ready to go to
Freshers’ Week, but
you soon realise you
were a week late. You
cry in the corner of your common room as
your peers mock you for being such a pathetic
c*unt with a very poor sense of timing. They
take issue with your wet pants and kick you
until you can’t even piss anymore. Fail.

Sagittarius
Recently you’ve been
wondering why Chris
Evan’s shit banter
appears in your head
everytime you get an
errection. You soon
figure out your penis is so long and skinny it acts
as a radio aerial. At least if you’re bored in lectures,
you now just have to stare at that fit chinese girl
three rows in front of you. A couple of tugs and
you should find Radio 2. Ah Terry...
