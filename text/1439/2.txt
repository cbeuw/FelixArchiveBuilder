Felix, ICRadio and Live!
nominated for national awards
T
his newspaper is once again
proud to announce another
nomination for the most
prestigious student media
award in the country. As Guardian
Student Newspaper of the Year in 2006
and 2008, felix is now aiming for a hat-
trick in 2009.
City & Guilds College Union-run
news website Live! has once again been
nominated for Website of the Year.
On Wednesday IC Radio also picked
up its first nominations for the an-
nual Student Radio Association (SRA)
awards since 2006. Student radio types
from all across the south came togeth-
er in a basement at Westminster Uni to
find out if they had been lucky enough
to get one of the 6 places on the short-
lists for 13 categories.
felix is nominated on the back of
2008’s triumphant victory as Student
Newspaper of the Year. Last year’s
Editor-in-Chief Jovan Nedic is said
to be pleasantly suprised with the
nomination.
Live! were winners of Website of the
Year two years ago under the editor-
ship of now Union President, Ashley
Brown.
The NUS started an annual student
journalism competition in 1947. From
1978, the Guardian has been involved
and since 1999 the newspaper has
been running its own separate Awards.
The Awards are today the most highly
prized by the UK’s university news-
paper writers. The nomination brings
substantial kudos to felix, improving
its ability to provide first-rate news
coverage even further. Sky News and
NME magazine are now also involved
in the Awards, making it a major event
in the peer-recognition calendar.
Congratulations also go to Dylan
Lowe, who has been nominated for
Travel Writer of the Year. The number
of awards for individual sections of the
paper has steadily grown over the years
and there are now thirteen different
categories. Dylan is the latest in a long
and growing list of felix writers whose
work has been recognised at a national
level by the Guardian. These included
two Overall Journalists of the Year over
the past three years including 2007-08
Editor-in-Chief Tom Roberts.
IC Radio saw off competition from
about 500 entries from over 30 stations
to pick up SRA nominations for Best
Male, for Roushan Alam, Best Enter-
tainment Show for The Roushan Alam
Show and Best Interview for one done
with Derren Brown. Done by, surprise
surprise, Roushan Alam.
It has been suggesed that the three
Channel four is clearly commited to using only the most respectable sources

nominations sets a precedent at the
SRA Awards. But in any case, 3 nomi-
nations is certainly mighty impressive
and ICRadio have expressed their ex-
treme pride at the nominations.
The man himself could be seen in
a state somewhere between ‘over the
moon’ and ‘I just won the lottery’ to-
wards the end of the night and will be
no doubt hoping to receive some of the
honours in at least one of the catego-
ries when the winners are announced
on the 5th of November.
IC Radio will putting on its glad rags
and hoping to pick up its first award
since 2002 at the glamorous/drunken
ceremony which takes place at Lon-
don’s swanky IndigO2. Live! and felix
will find out what the judge’s final deci-
sions are on the 25th of November.
Well done to all who have worked
hard to get this recognition of Imperial
College’s excellence in student media.
Freshers’ Fair soggy yet again
