Slow News Summer
I
f you have just joined IC, wel-
come – I’m sure you will love
your time here. If you are a re-
turning reader, hang in there,
it will soon be over. Those who
like to keep up with business and fi-
nance news but could not be bothered
to read over the summer are in luck.
This section will offer the laziest way
currently available to sound like you
know what you are talking about. We
also throw in some right-wing rants for
good measure. Feel free to email me if
you disagree with our analysis or wish
to write for felix Business.
felix reviews the first prolonged period of few surprises and
relative normality since the start of the financial crises
Since the recent triumph of the DPJ in
the Japanese elections, we have been
getting some rather mixed messages.
The main reason for this is that the DPJ
have needed a coalition with the PNP
of Shizuka Kamei to hold a majority in
the upper house. Mr Kamei’s views are
at odds with the DPJ leadership’s will-
ingness to embrace the free markets as
a means of returning dynamism to the
Japanese economy.
The DPJ has been insistant that the
government should interfere less in the
foreign exchange markets than it has
done in the past. But it must contend
with Japanese exporters, hit hard by
the recent recession, who are lobbying
strongly for a weaker Yen. Meanwhile
the PNP has been demanding govern-
ment write-offs of bad consumer debt
and opposing privatisation plans.
The result of all this has been a
number of mixed statements that have
moved the markets substantially in dif-
ferent directions in recent weeks. The
most likely outcome will be short term
moves to appease the exporters along-
side longer-term plans to allow the Yen
to float more freely. Expect to see less
sensitivity to such comments in future.

O
n September 25th HR1207,
a bill that will remove key
restrictions on the Gov-
ernment Accountability
Office’s ability to audit the Federal Re-
serve got its first full hearing in the
House Committee on Financial Serv-
ices. Lifelong anti-Fed campaigner Dr
Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, is the
Bill’s sponsor. He believes it will help
stop the Fed’s ability to fund large gov-
ernment programmes such as wars
and will make its manipulation of the
currency more difficult.
The Bill has bipartisan support with
over two thirds of the House signed on
as co-sponsors, as well 80% of Ameri-
can voters according to the latest polls.
There nonetheless remain serious
challenges from the likes of Congress-
man Mel Watt. He who drew the com-
mittee’s attention to a recent open let-
ter by economists arguing against the
legislation, published in the WSJ. “It
was signed by about eighty academic
intellectual err academic type people
so yeah” he added.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has
been attempting to alleviate some of

G20 Meet in Pittsburgh
T
he recent financial crisis
was particularly difficult for
its supposed culprits – sub-
prime borrowers in Amer-
ica. They are typically poor, heavily
indebted and unable to purchase basic
necessities such as cars. Meanwhile,
in its attempts to save the economy
from its debt and over-consumption
problems, the US government has ex-
panded its debt to almost $6 trillion in
order to stimulate consumption.
A small but illuminating way to deal
with such problems was up and run-
ning by August. ‘Cash for Clunkers’
involves the government handing out
$4500 of borrowed money to Ameri-
cans to destroy their cheaper cars –
the sort poor people would otherwise

have been able to afford on the second
hand market. They must then use this
money, probably alongside additional
personal loans, to buy newer cars.
These are themselves built at a loss
to the American taxpayer who is cur-
rently subsidising their manufacturers.
Alongside the trillions spent (or at
least appropriated for spending) here
and there, this may seem small pick-
ings. The scheme was declared a huge
success for exhausting its initial $3 bil-
lion budget, for instance. But the larger
significance is the insight it gives in-
vestors into the thinking of the current
administration. During the depression
they destroyed food and farmland. In-
vestors could have been forgiven for
thinking they would have learned their
lesson by now. It would appear they
still need a little more time.
T
he main outcome of Septem-
ber’s gathering of the world’s
nineteen supposedly-most-
influential governments plus
the EU was a general agreement to give
more say to developing nations.
For example, it was decided that the
group should replace the G8 as the
main forum for more important states
to move on global policy faster than
the UN would be able to. The consen-
sus comes after growing sentiments
that the lender-borrower relationship
now consolidated between poor and
rich countries should be more even.
There was some scepticism on this
due to the tone of much of the conver-
sation and the limited change in vot-
ing rights. This consisted of pledges
to transfer 5% of IMF voting shares
from over-represented nations (such
as Belgium that gets more votes than
Brazil) to emerging economies, and a
similar transfer involving 3% of World
Bank shares. The meeting also covered
policy areas considered more effec-
tively tackled with global co-operation.
Free trade and climate change took a
back seat to the hotter populist top-
ics of banker pay and global financial
regulation.
Concerns over high banking sector
pay have some justification given the
taxpayer bailouts earlier in the year. It
is particularly difficult for the bailed
out banks to make the argument that
caps on bonuses may lead their most
talented to leave, since their talents are
now in serious question.
This development should not, how-
ever, concern prospective entrants
into the sector. London’s usurpation
of New York’s seat as financial capital
of the world amply demonstrated the
industry’s sensitivity to interference
and the lightness of its feet. That the
lesson was not lost on the French and
Germans explains their otherwise du-
bious advice to London about the need
for tougher curbs.
On the broader issue of financial reg-
ulation the world was also saved from
the G20’s deluded thinking only by the
weakness of its will. Having given tac-
tical business advice and suggestions
of deferred bonuses to better capture
longer-term systemic risks to bank-
ing executives, the delegates moved
on to proposals for centrally-planned
finance. Even the Pope took a break
from the Vatican’s traditional support
for private property to endorse global
financial regulation in his encyclical,
Caritas in Veritate, published July 7th.
They should have been able to agree
on substantial changes given how
mainstream their cause has become.
They largely failed.
Shizuka Kamei of the PNP
the concern surrounding the nature
of its operations. Senior staff led by no
less than Bernanke himself have been
touring the country promoting the case
for Fed secrecy in order for it to ‘stay
independent’. In the process they have
already made available new informa-
tion. Even strong allies such as former
New York Fed President Tim Geithner
and House Financial Services Comit-
tee Chair Barney Frank have suggested
that some sort of relaxation on GAO
audit restrictions may be benefitial. A
Federal Judge recently found in favour
of a Freedom of Information Act re-
quest by Bloomberg News of the Fed’s
books. Given the global significance of
the Federal Reserve System, this will be
an important space to watch.
T
he democrats have spent the
best part of the year so far
trying to make healthcare
cheaper and more accessi-
ble to uninsured people in America.
Estimates of the bill for the Bill range
from self-funding to about three tril-
lion dollars. Congressional democrats
have spent the summer trying to sell
the plans to increasingly hostile voters
at town hall meetings. The protestors
at such meetings have in turn been
getting more vocal about their objec-
tions to the increased involvement of
a demonstrably incompetent govern-
ment in an extremely sensitive area of
their until-now-private lives.
They point out that of the forty-five
million people with no health insur-
ance, eleven million are prevented
from purchasing any because they
are illegal immigrants. Fifteen million
earn more than the average Ameri-
can but feel insurance is bad value for
money as current regulations force
them to subsidise the less healthy.
Another sixteen million are already
eligible for Medicaid, which specifi-
cally covers the poor, but choose not
to fill out the forms largely because it is
easier to be treated on demand for free
in emergency wards if needed.
If you believe the polls, most Ameri-
cans view the main problem as not
access but cost. In the past decade,
healthcare inflation has consistently
been three times the overall figure.
Today America spends 16% of its GDP
on health. This is a greater propor-
tion than any other developed nation
and twice the OECD average. The les-
son from the freer parts of the sector,
namely dentistry and optometry, are
clear.
At present state governments only
allow providers based in the state to
offer insurance. So far federal authori-
ties have not attempted to enforce the
inter-state commerce clause, which
would increase competeion in the in-
surance sector and drive down prices.
The other major problem causing high-
er prices is severe limits on the ability
of healthcare providers to compete on
price because of discrimination laws
as well as the single-price bargaining
practice of Medicaid and Medicare.
Oh, don’t slip now. Oh wait. I already did. Is that meant to be in two pieces?
