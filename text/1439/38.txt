How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

No answers last week, but I trust that
this is just a minor blip and this week
we will be flooded with answers. If not
I am going to get very angry indeed.

So last week’s answer was
HARDPENIS, if any of you were
interested, seeing as none of you
sent it in, if you don’t send the
answers in we’ll keep the ipods
for ourselves, topical answer for
this week.
Scribble box
Going underground
Well done Thomas Woods for the
getting the underground station, We’re
not sure what station it was because
Chaz is a twat, with a memory to match.
This week’s station has probably got the
best name of all the station, but then I
am biased.

28
= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 70?
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
