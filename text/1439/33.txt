Epic fail on this young Fresher’s part. Not only does he have a bald penis
on his three chins, it looks like he’s got fingernails a drag-queen would
be proud to have.
Messy start to the year? We’d love to see
the results. Please? Email your photos to

WHAT ODD IMPERIAL STEREOTYPE
HAVE YOU NOTICED ABOUT?
I attended the Medics’ Pubcrawl and
had far too much to drink. I ended
up in Fabric where my friend broke
her ankle. We went to the hospital at
about 4am. Bear in mind I was still
dressed in scrubs and off my head.
After walking straight past security, I
proceeded to skip around the hospital
singing Oasis and persuading patients
I was their doctor.

I was sharing a room with a Medic
in halls, and he brought along a life
size plastic skeleton with him to
university. It just took up loads of
space in our room.
So when he was out (my roommate
not the skeleton), me and some people
I barely knew took the skeleton on a
round trip of London, took pictures at
famous landmarks and posted them to
my roomate throughout the year.
I’m not quite sure he’s figured out
what went on, but I know he can’t
sleep in the same room as the skeleton
anymore!

At the Mingle I told Jo Whiley I loved
her. She seemed charmed at first, but
being off my face, I tried to crowdsurf
to the front. My plan was to jump the
barrier onto stage and hug her.
Instead I fell head-first onto the floor
and broke some bones in my shoulder.

Whilst I was moving into Halls,
I wanted to make a really good
impression and introduced myself to
everyone. Being excited and a few too
many glasses of Pimms, I jumped up
on a chair to greet someone else and
my trousers fell straight down in front
of the entire hall at the Coming-Up
dinner. I don’t think I’ll live this one
down. Well, you know how I am if
you’re in my hall.

Me and my new mate had this thing
where we’d jump on each other when
we saw each other. It was all jokes.
However, I got mistaken and launched
myself onto my lecturer.

I had never eaten Chinese food
before, and on a hall trip to
Chinatown, I ate something which
my stomach didn’t agree with, and
vommed all over my plate and on the
girl I fancied in my hall. Safe to say I
didn’t end up with her.

My mum turned up on my 3rd day
because she missed me too much. She
came to the Freshers’ Ball with me. I
have never been so embarrassed in
my life.

I got so drunk I woke up in Hyde Park
yesterday with bird crap all over my
hands. Well, I think it was bird crap.
Anyway, I’m at the GP surgery being
checked for any diseases right now.
Drunk!
I met with my buddy I was assigned
through my course. She caught me....
rearranging myself and won’t stop
calling me ‘Wanky” in emails.
