[Insert travel-related title here]
What would the inserted title be some thirty years prior to our time? Dylan Lowe explores what trav-
elling was three decades ago, and compares it what we know as ‘tourism’ today.
T
he house glittered only
with lit candles and
oil lamps. It was noth-
ing like the glamour
of illumination ‒ I say
squander of electricity ‒ back at
Coral View Resort. But then, when
one was cross-legged on the mat,
bilos of kava passed around and
drained down throats under the
thunderous claps, I saw it as utter
bliss.
Blissfully drunk on the narcotic pep-
per plant root, and blissfully isolated
from my fellow resort residents.
So when I wasn’t busy gulping, I
turned my attention to my hosts, and
my short-term travel companion. Only
earlier in the afternoon did I meet Jun-
ior over a resort staff’s game of touch
rugby, and in true Fijian fashion the
conversation topic drifted to kava.
Hours later, not before the treacherous
near- pitch black jungle trek, we were
treated to hospitality in a stranger’s
house and surrounded by his entire,
equally kava- fanatical, family.
And wherever the magic drink goes,
interesting dialogues follow.
Junior’s father was busy flaunting his
collection of items, from the beautiful-
ly preserved antique guest book ‒ the
household doubled as a guesthouse in
the ’80s ‒ to decades-old maps. They
all, he explained, represented the re-
gretfully passed days of travel, when
travellers could legitimately title them-
selves as adventurers.
Seizing the opportunity, I dropped
the big question. If I can remember it
right, alongside the numbness in my
lips and limbs, I grew fascinated with
the priceless perspective of a local on
how travelling has changed since thirty
years ago.

These were the first images to be
conjured from my memory bank
when STA Travelbuzz ‒ I began
working for them as a travel blogger
several months ago ‒ asked me to
write something about how much
travelling has changed for the last
thirty years, the age of thirty be-
ing the birthday STA Travel has re-
cently celebrated. And since I spent
the ’80s being scattered molecules
and part-time foetus, and the ’90s
as an unworldly toddler, I naturally
required the wisdom of elders to
complete my task.
Anyone from Spain, a Greek island,
or one of many European cultures
of an older generation can tell you
how much tourism has drastically
reshaped their homeland, from the
mere increase of man-flow to the big-
ger landscape-reforming stuff. This is
especially true when the destination
comprises of long strips of white sand
and warm seas.
This is the new manifestation of co-
lonialism. For evidence look no further
than the hordes of tourist settlements
occupying the Spanish coastline.
But hey, this isn’t the ‘change’ in
tourism that I am dwelling on with
nostalgic sentiments – in European
terms tourists nowadays merely have
less perfume, more showers and horse-
power compared to their counterparts
a century ago. It was what said on that
breezy August evening by Junior’s dad,
over the grog, that caught me sighing.

The atmosphere wasn’t sombre –
or sober – but the question raised
some seriousness in his tone.
“But don’t you think the Yasawa
Flyer is bringing in too many tour-
ists?” I was referring to the cata-
maran that dumps senseless visi-
tors daily onto the Yasawa island
group, northwest of Fiji, like nu-
clear waste. Only moments ago, the
master of the household was de-
picting the sole method of reaching
the outer islands in the olden days
– by hitchhiking on fishing boats.
“It brings jobs, opportunities,
technology. The Yasawa Flyer
makes it easier for islanders to
travel to the mainland, and vice
versa…”
“But what about cultural integ-
rity?” I gesture towards my resort.
“When most of those tourist come
in they want to lie on the beach and
sunbathe, not learning your cul-
ture. Doesn’t that bother you?”
It did bother him.
There was that glint of nostalgia
in his eyes when he spoke of the
old-school kind of travellers back
in the ’80s. The ones who would
cross mountain ranges and open
seas just to reach a genuinely exotic
location, and build genuine friend-
ships with the indigenous folks and
leave with enough moral obliga-
tions to return. Every signature in
his guest book was testimony that
this race of travellers exists.
And there was this Canadian
book illustrator, who first came to
the island in 1985 and returned to
stay for six months. He remains a
regular visitor, despite the hefty
distance between Vancouver and
Fiji. He still speaks to the family on
the phone – in Fijian.
One subtle thing I have noticed
about our conversation – even
though I was mercifully intoxi-
cated – was that the father spoke
better English than his children,
Junior and his brother Moses. One
may account this to the dwindling
British influence in Fiji, an ex-col-
ony, and consequently the decrease
in English-orientated education.
However, I saw a grimmer cause.
With more guests less willing to
mingle with the resort staff, the
locals are more inclined to spend
time amongst themselves and con-
verse in their local dialects. And
with the mutual respect between
English and Fijian speakers broken
down, English is treated as a lan-
guage of the tyrannical ‘masters’
and Fijian the local renaissance of
the free-spirited and oppressed.
This is especially true when many
tourists, as I observed, go on holi-
day hoping to cast aside the sup-
pression they endure during their
normal lives and expect to afford
royalty treatment. What they tend
to forget is that, like themselves,
their ‘servants’ are human beings
too.
Meanwhile, my ‘servant’ was
now escorting us back to our dor-
mitories. It was pitch black in the
tropical forests, with little illumi-
