Get involved!
So you’ve read what I’ve got to say, but don’t let that stop you. If
you’ve got a passion for technology, got something to say, or just
want to heckle me over some sordid gadget then get involved!
Email me at: technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk
If it’s something decent you might even end up in felix one week.
Hello Google Wave!
What’s all this Waving business about and why should you care?

In a place filled
with digital
A
pple Tablet. Ha, now I
have your attention. It’s
all over the news, some
mythical, do it all device
that’s going to replace your computer,
your phone, your life. It’s going to end
world hunger, make you super-human
and might even get you laid.
Bollocks! You say? Well you’d be spot
on. The thing is, it’s all bollocks. At this
stage no one knows anything. Serious-
ly, it’s all hearsay and rumour. Some
might be more legitimate than others,
but it’s all still rumours. Yes, Foxconn
might make it (they’re the chinese
company who makes the iPhone, and
the one with the ‘suicide’ secracy pol-
icy). And yes Apple probably has been
trying to make one since 2003, but
most good tech companies make in-
roads along all avenues of research and
development at one stage or another.
Otherwise they wouldn’t be ‘good’ tech
companies. So until Mr. Jobs pulls one
out of his pocket and/or manialla enve-
lope, don’t believe everything you read.
More Apple news this week which
should be of interest to anyone think-
ing of getting an iPhone in the near fu-
ture. O2 exclusivity deal for the iPhone
in the UK will run out in the next cou-
ple of months. Both Orange, which is
in the process of trying to merge with
T-mobile to create the biggest UK net-
work, and Vodaphone have already
announced availability of the iPhone
from late 2009/early 2010. I say great
news as O2 totally rips iPhone users off
with crappy tarrifs and arguably poor
3G service anywhere but London.
Of course O2 still have their grubby
mits on a Palm Pre exclusivity con-
tract, so anyone seeking a bit of we-
bOS are still stuck with the Telefonica
off-shoot.
Spotify brought their offline playlist
caching to the desktop this week fol-
lowing in the footsteps of their mobile
apps on Android and the iPhone. Un-
fortunately requiring a premium, £9.99
per month subscription, the desktop
Spotify app now comes armed with a
simple offline switch. Spotify is cer-
tainly gunning for your hard-earned
here and a piece of the iTunes market
share. Personally I think they should
enable the mobile apps and caching for
the free ad-supported accounts, but I
guess you’ve got to have some sort of
incentive to go premium.

Weekly Wrap Up - The Best of the rest in the world of technology
T
his week has been an in-
teresting week for Tech.
First off on the big news,
Apple/Intel announced
and demonstrated a new data trans-
mission system the aptly named,
Light Peak, which is capable of up
to 10Gbps over an optical intercon-
nect up to 100m in length. Managing
to both smoothly drive a greater than
HD res monitor and saturate a speedy
SSD raid with a file transfer over one
connection, shows this could be a real
contender with USB 3.0, FireWire and
DisplayPort.
The idea behind Light Peak is to re-
duce the number of connections and
standards you need on a single device
and with that kind of bandwidth I can
seriously see it replacing a lot of con-
nections on your laptop, palmtop and
even your desktop. Mind you looking
at the hulking rig they used to demon-
strate it, I wouldn’t expect to see this
in your iPhone/iPod any time soon, but
rumours have it appearing in the Au-
tumn 2010 Mac line.
In other news, the first ever writ
via Twitter was served by the British
High Court this week. The injunction
was one against an anonymous Twit-
ter user impersonating the right-wing
blogger Donal Blaney, owner of Griffin
Law. This decision to employ Twitter
as a legitimate service for serving the
injunction is interesting from many as-
pects. The law tends to be a somewhat
S
o, what’s all this Wav-
ing business all about and
should you care?
Well, Wave is Google’s new
communication project that is some-
what difficult to describe, but is based
around an amalgamation of IM, email
and real-time collaboration services.
It’s currently in a closed beta, recently
expanded to 100,000 testers (all in-
vited manually if we’re to believe the
buzz) and may revolutionise the way
we communicate with our friends, co-
workers and family across the internet.
I’ve got MSN/Yahoo/AOL/Gtalk IM
already, and email, why would I want
something else? Well, imagine a we-
bapp that you can login to from any-
where with a browser, that gave you
collaborative blend of IM and email
with a load of sharing features all in a
tidy and unique package. That’s what
Google’s aim is for Wave. It’s some-
thing that you’ll have to see to really
understand but one of its stand out
features is the instant character broad-
cast. That is, the text you type instantly
appears in the Wave for everyone to see
the moment your finger hits the key.
Now in my mind this will lead to a load
of typos, but if we gloss over that, we
could have collaborative conversations
where you can interpret what people
are saying, edit it in real-time and even
finish their sentences for them. Replies
can be started in a separate message,
but you can also reply to someone’s
sentence right in that sentence mean-
ing you no longer have any ambiguity
to who or what you might be replying
to. The Wave also represents a persist-
ent message a bit like email, meaning
you can invite people or send them the
Wave at a later date. They’ll get all the
conversation and edits and be able to
play it back blow by blow with the re-
play feature. Say you’ve got a conversa-
tion about a busted piece of equipment
between two colleagues. They can talk
it all out with costs and alternatives in
a Wave, once they’ve come to a conclu-
sion of how to proceed, they can then
send the whole Wave to their boss. He
can see all the information but doesn’t
need to haggle over the details to sign
off on it. It’ll be a lot cleaner and much
more efficient than sending a chain of
emails, especially if more than one or
two people are replying, something
that makes a complete mess of emails.
Waves are more than collaborative
IM sessions though. You can directly
embed media in them via simple drag
and drop. Photos, YouTube videos and
Google Docs can all be directly em-
bedded within the Wave for watching,
editing, reading or viewing. Examples
given by Google for real world use of
Wave could be checking of a contract,
reviewing the document and pulling
bits of text out into Waves for collabo-
rative editing. Now I can see myself ed-
iting journal articles and joint project
write-ups like this, so for students it
could be incredibly useful for all the
group projects everyone seems to have
to go through.
Another stand out feature that might
be incredibly useful, if it works as de-
scribed, are the use of Wave extensions,
one of which was real-time (can you
see a trend here?) translation. Imagine
talking to a friend in Brazil in Portu-
guese, just by typing in English. Now
I must admit that machine translation
has never been particularly accurate,
but it should be sufficient for your
friend to work out what you’re say-
ing. Language barrier be damned, we
will converse about that sick YouTube
video, even if we don’t speak the same
language.
The beauty of Google Wave however
has to be in the code, and forgive me
if this is boring to some of you, but it’s
mostly written in HTML5. This means
that without any major effort, it should
work on any up-to-date browser on any
platform on any device with feature
parity. The obvious implementation is
mobile platforms. Google is right on
this and as of the developer preview, a
working iPhone webapp complete with
pretty home screen icon was working,
with one exception editing. It’s some-
thing that’s not supported directly in
HTML5 but is also something that
could change by the time the webapp
hits the wider world.
So will Wave succeed? I find it hard
to believe it won’t afterall it is Google.
Will it be useful? Undoubtedly it will
be useful, especially for anyone who
wants to collaboratively edit some-
thing, so for students I think it could
simply genius. Will it replace every-
thing else? No, and I think that’s where
the hype out-reaches the possibility for
the product. With a load of social net-
working sites, IM networks and good
old email pretty entrenched, Google
Wave is not going to roll in and wash
all else out. Should you be excited?
Well I’m intrigued and I think you
should check it out as soon as you can,
which may not be for a good while, but
it’s not going to be earth shattering
when it lands.

slow and behind the times force which
has shown unexpected forward think-
ing. It also means that a precedent has
been set for both serving writs across
the service and also the targeting of
anonymous abuse across the internet.
As the film industry and now both
Sky and Sony among others all push
towards 3D TV, Sony made a signifi-
cant announcement of a single lens
3D video camera. Up until now, all
3D recording was essentially done by
bolting two lenses with two sensors to-
gether. This meant that the camera is
both bulky and not suited for any fast
moving recording such as sport.
Sony have shoved two CMOS sen-
sors behind one lens with the light
split by a system of mirrors. This is
good news for anyone who’s after 3D
football in the near future or fancies
themselves a 3D film maker (with a
large bank balance).
Electric cars also got some love this
week in the form of another fantas-
tic looking sports car, the e-Wolf e-2,
which is set to give the Shelby Aero
and of course the Tesla Roadster a run
for their money. Looking like the boys
from Lambo gave it the once over and
boasting more than 1000Nm of torque
with a top speed of 250Km/h (that’s
155mph in old money) the e-2 might
make a decent pin up yet.
Batteries also got some love from
IBM this week, with the announce-
ment that they’ve assigned a task force
of about 40 to the Battery 500 project.
The aim is to boost battery storage
density by a factor of 10 in an effort
to get electric cars to the mythical
500mile range.
Focusing on lithium-air technology,
they’re not going to feature in a car
you can buy any time soon, but it’s re-
ally important for the evolution of the
electric car to have a storage system
that can power it for a decent distance,
so good on you IBM, fingers crossed
for a swift breakthrough.
