Being away from home can be hard
So here we are, Freshersâ€™ Week has
finished and youâ€™re now faced with lec-
tures and getting down to some hard
work at the institution that is Imperial
College.
For many of you, youâ€™ve probably
have had one of the most exhilarating
weeks of your life, made loads of new
friends along the way, and have settled
in quite comfortably to student life.
For some, however, this may not be the
case.
It is natural in many aspects to feel
homesick at certain times of our lives.
Leaving home for the first time and liv-
ing with people you donâ€™t know in a big
strange city like London can be diffi-
cult; a daunting experience to come to
terms with.
Not being around things that are fa-
miliar to you can often bring on feel-
ings of loneliness, anxiety and sadness;
this may put doubts in your mind
about becoming a student and study-
ing at Imperial.
Be assured, though: all is not lost.
These feelings may only last a week or
so until you have settled in, and there
are methods and tips you can use to
help make you feel better. For now,
check out the The Advice Centreâ€™s top
tips for trying to avoid or getting over
homesickness.
If you do have feelings of homesick-
ness and you feel it is more than just
a phase, you can seek some impartial
advice on these feelings and also on
how you can go about sorting through
theses issues, please feel free to con-
tact The Advice Centre. The Advisor is
totally impartial and will talk through
your worries with you.
If you feel you need more of an emo-
tional support rather than practical ad-
vice it may be worth you approaching
the Student Counseling Service on: 020
7594 9637. If these feelings are caus-
ing you serious distress and you feel
you need to speak to a doctor make an
appointment at the Imperial College
Health Centre on: 020 7594 9375/6.
Just remember there are people avail-
able who can help, you are not alone!

The Advice Centreâ€™s Top Tips for beating homesickness:
â€¢ Try to get out there and see what the College and
Union have to offer for example joining a club or
society is a great way of meeting new people and
taking your mind away from thinking about home.
â€¢ Acknowledge your feelings but try to convince
yourself that it is just a phase: feelings of
homesickness almost always pass in the end.
â€¢ Talking to people about your feelings can sometimes
help, so make sure you talk to a trusted friend
regarding your feelings this can often make things
seem not as bad or if you feel you cant talk to anyone
make use of The collegeâ€™s counseling service or you
can talk your concerns through with a personal tutor
or the student Adviser at the Advice Centre.
â€¢ Try to establish a routine as soon as possible often
when you are kept busy it helps to take your mind off
thinking about home.
â€¢ Keep in touch with your friends and family in some
cases they can offer you support, however make sure
that this is the right choice for you as sometimes
talking to home can bring on your homesickness
feelings.
â€¢ Give yourself some time donâ€™t rush in to any rash
decisions like quitting your course and leaving, it
could just be a small phase of theses feelings you are
going through as its your first time away from home,
there is support out there you are not on your own.
â€¢ Remember that many people suffer from home
sickness at sometime in their lives also there will
be students on your course and in the college that
are suffering the same as you, it does not make you
inadequate as plenty of people are experiencing
exactly the same feelings as you.
