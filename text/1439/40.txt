Needy McNeedy has left felix. NO ONE LEAVES
ALIVE. Here’s Aunty McPickle in the meanwhile
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have a worrying and embarrassing
qualm. I have recently been subject
to the cacophonous sounds of my flat
mate’s climatic orgasms. The odd
thing is no one ever seems to enter
or leave her room before or after. I
can only assume that she is an expert
auto-pleasure-er. The thing is, I have
started to join in when I know that
she’s “on it”
. I don’t consider myself a
lesbian; I have up until now only had
heterosexual desires. Do you think
I’m gay?
A confused Sally Fanita
Dear Sally,
This is a puzzling predicament. The
way I see it you should consider explor-
ing this recent recreation. Maybe go for
some sneaky online girl on girl porn
and see if this has any effect.
There’s nothing wrong with explor-
ing and as long as you are quieter than
your flat mate, nobody has to know.
Maybe you should also check the valid-
ity of your heteorsexualness... hook up
with some hunky hussie? Then perhaps
you could “accidently” stumble into the
flat mate in question’s room and slip
into a threesome?
Try to break the barriers and you
might find yourself exercising a liber-
ated libido.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have recently found a massive blue
dildo in my girl friend’s draw. I am
struggling with feelings of redun-
dancy, what should I do?
A deflated Derik
Dear Derik,
Well sounds like your girlfriend is pretty
randy. Are you sure you are exploiting
this rather handsome characteristic?
Maybe she doesn’t use it anymore, and
ironically the dildo is the redundant
party.
How about “innocently” suggesting
using one and observe her reaction or
be honest and just ask her about it.
Depending on the openness (no pun
intended) of your relationship she may
be likely to embellish the truth, so try to
read her body language.
If it really bothers you, you could hide
it or throw it away. She’ll probably
think she’s lost it. If you find a new one
in its place, then you’ll know what’s go-
ing on and confrontation may be need-
ed. Otherwise, how about slapping on
some body paint?

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am currently stuck in the union toi-
lets with a rather persistent deposit,
which won’t go down. I have friends
waiting and their suspicions are un-
doubtedly growing by the minute.
Please help!
Lillie McPhilyme
Hi Lillie,
Mmm this is a dilemma. Here are what
I consider these to be your options:
1. Leave the unpleasant present for the
next unlucky toilet dweller to discover
and prey that you don’t know them and
never see them again.
2. Stay there all night, flushing away
until it finally goes or the lights are
turned off which would open up the
perfect opportunity for your escape.
3. Try the toilet brush trick
4. Avidly defend that it wasn’t you to
the next frequenter.
5. Crawl seamlessly under the door into
the next cubicle and make a run for it.
6. Put the toilet seat down as a pre-
warning, (probably the kindest option)
and leave ashamedly, face down.
7. Put something baggish over your
head to avoid future recognition for the
rest of your time at Imperial.
On return to your friends you can
either make up an elaborate but be-
lievable story or just pretend that the
duration of your absence wasn’t an ab-
normally long time. Hope that helps, in
the future maybe you should consider
improving the timing of your digestive
traffic.

Not blue, but definitely a dildo
As of this year, RAG has a weekly
piece in felix, meaning I get to an-
noy you issue after issue! For all
of you who have never come across
RAG before, let me enlighten you (all
of you who already know what RAG
is should read on cause it’s really very
quite interesting). We raise money for
our chosen charities in any way possi-
ble. And when I say any, I mean ANY!
RAG provides a means for you to have
a great time, while raising money for
people who actually need it.
If you didn’t make it to our Freshers
Fair stall, then don’t feel left out ‘cause
we’re always looking for enthusiastic
altruists.
Throughout the year, we go on loads
of collections on around London, as
well as putting on a bunch of events
worth going to.
The first one is LOST on the 28th of
November, which involves being cart-
ed onto a bus in teams of 2 or 3, blind-
folded, and driven to an undisclosed
location. You then need to make your
way back to the Union for the after
party. Someone told me there will be
prizes…
Everything we do is great fun (oth-
erwise we wouldn’t organise it!), so it’s
definitely worth giving it a try. If you
thing RAG is something you’d enjoy or
you want to get LOST, give us a shout
at rag@ic.ac.uk.
RAG is here to stay
...and the most illustrious RAG chair, Alex Dahinten, is here to tell
you all about the wonderful things they have planned for you
