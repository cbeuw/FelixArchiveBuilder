And now...
Back to reality
T
o those who had sighed
in relief that your dev-
ilish exams were over,
blossomed from your
burial of lecture notes,
and kick-started holiday mode just
to see the end of summer, welcome
back to Imperial College. Here, the
sun is shining, and academic en-
slavement awaits.
As for the rest of you, down your
pint fresher.
Hopefully many of you would’ve
had the blessings of St Christopher
and done a decent amount of trav-
elling; I certainly have myself. Even
now as I speak, I’m in my bed of a
guesthouse in Port Vila, Vanuatu,
where the owner, upon deciding
I’ve done a runner without pay-
ment, has detained all of my be-
longings. Fun times.
As I recline in bed waiting for
the key holders, festering heat and
barking dogs in as backdrop, I be-
gan musing on the inevitable: in no
time my journey would come to an
end, and I’ll be back in the lecture
room feigning concentration.
I may be on holiday daydreaming
about reality, though in a month’s
time it’ll be no doubt the other way
round.
But why not daydream? After all,
travel-related ambitions sprout
from the absent-minded moments
don’t they? Give yourself plenty of
time to make preparations and wait
for the inspiration to click. Who
knows where your next adventure
takes you?
And to help you dreamers out, I’m
going to do my best as travel editor
to relieve your Friday-afternoon
blues. Two terms of experimenta-
tion and a great deal of thinking
later, allow me to introduce some
of the new features and improve-
ments to the existing format.
The main feature continues to
deliver colourful accounts of epic
locations, breathtaking sceneries
and personal thoughts, all written
by members and friends of Impe-
rial College. The coming year will
see many more guest writers shar-
ing their experiences; those fed up
with reading about my Morocco
hitch, rejoice.
The editorial will address many
more travel-related issues, wheth-
er it was something I’ve stumbled
across during my travels or my al-
cohol/kava-fuelled conversations.
There will be several new addi-
tions gracing the travel section.
‘Postcards from afar’ will have
readers sending in postcards or
photographs from their foreign
ventures, with an attached story to
tell of the place or encounter. For
more details see the column below.
‘Interview with the extraordi-
naire’ will feature interviews I’ve
conducted with legendary figures
in the world of travel. To begin
with, my interview with Ben Keene,
co-founder of Tribewanted (http://
www.tribewanted.com), will be
published shortly alongside a fea-
ture article on the project ‒ stay
tuned for that one.
In the meantime, stop lamenting
that your holiday was over ‒ in-
stead why not look forward to the
vacations yet to come? With some
positive thinking and a bit of help
here from the travel department,
perhaps reality isn’t that grim af-
ter all.

nation save a half moon and mal-
functioning torch. Junior’s silhou-
ette grew to intimidate me a little
– the adrenaline was there pumped
through the veins.
That instant, I had a taster of the
sense of adventure my predecessors
would have experienced when they
came to visit the same island, the
same forests and same hospitality.
And with the increasing conven-
ience in air-conditioned coaches,
business-class airport lounges,
top-speed catamarans and five-
star hotels, the entire market is al-
most exclusively catered for luxury
seekers, and less inclined to serve
the intrepid adventurers the thrill
they seek.
But then, they had little reliance
on what was an almost inexistent
tourist industry.
Our generation has been pam-
pered with so much comfort and
convenience that, at first oppor-
tunity, we cling onto what deemed
‘safe’ more so than our counter-
parts three decades ago, even
without us knowing. As much as I
would love to condemn the tour-
ism industry for ruining my ideal
adventure, I must admit: am I capa-
ble of shredding my Lonely Planet,
ditching STA Travel, embracing
100% local diet and rambling into
the sunset on local transport?
Let’s be realistic. The answer
is no. And hands off my amazing
Lonely Planet collection.

It has been at least two weeks since
winding up in bed, feeling merry,
after a pensive evening – appar-
ently the other guests settled for an
uneventful early-night. It may have
been an archipelago of close prox-
imity, Vanuatu possesses a distinc-
tive culture that not only starkly
differs from that of Fiji, but also
varies from island to island.
Besides that, I treat Vanuatu with
affection as a less-developed substi-
tute of the Fiji I had previously fallen
in love with.
And by less developed I meant dusty
guesthouses, canned tuna and corned
beef for lunch, and dinner, gas lamps
for staggering back to the bungalow
under the guidance of a visible Milky
Way. Rowdy tourists found a spot in
my distant memory. Dirt tracks were
a norm, mini trucks a must. No seat-
belts? Just cling on tighter, and enjoy
the ride.
My thrill-seeking inner self was
satisfied.
Turning to Kelson, my guide and
fellow bird hunter, I accepted a glass
of water infused with lemon leaves.
We chatted under the stars.
Getting along with local cannibals...err...friendly tribesmen
But then, what the hell is kava?
*Clap, Bula...*gulp gulp gulp..*clap *clap *clap...hmmmm, mucky water
I
f someone has recently re-
turned from Fiji or Vanuatu,
and told you that kava is
muddy water that taste like
piss, do me a favour – tell
him/her to get a palate transplant.
Preferably swap brains too.
For heaven’s sake, don’t be misled
into hating it automatically.
Kava, or yaqona, or grog in Fi-
jian slang, is a type of pepper plant
(Piper methysticum, for you botany
fanatics out there) found in the
western Pacific. Only the roots of
the plant is used in the actual prep-
aration of the drink.
Kava roots are generally pounded
into powdered form – islanders in
Vanuatu are known to chew the
potent root. The powder is then
emulsified with water until it all
“I don’t get tourists,” he went on
bluntly. “They come to the island, and
they spend so much money on food
and accommodation and everything.
But why do that, when they can come
and live with us for free?”
I could explain to him the entire
concept of monetary values, just as
some American kids were attempt-
ing to teach locals business manage-
ment. But did I want to contribute in
destroying their cultural concept of
unconditional sharing?
Besides, I was disgusted to hear
about what the Americans were
doing.
It did get me thinking, wouldn’t this
be what an older generation of Fijians
– think twenty years ago – have un-
dergone, the same wind of change?
Before they could resist the tempta-
tion to drift away from tradition – I
have met many money-orientated
ni-Vans – their surroundings would
have been ‘upgraded’ to suit our
needs, and them having to adapt ac-
cording to our needs. The world is
indeed changing.
At least I got a glimpse of a time
portal before the storm strikes.
resembles muddy water.
The effects of kava includes
numbing of the tongue and lips,
general relaxation and, as a narcot-
ic, sensations that resemble effects
of alcoholism.
It also apparently combats stress,
insomnia, anxiety and helps lower-
ing chloesterol levels.
In Fiji the concept of kava-drink-
ing is firmly cemented to the strict
codes of tribal culture. While a
tabua (smelly whale tooth) is pre-
sented at occasions of business
conducts, kava roots symbolises
goodwill and are presented as you
visit a village, making request for
marriage, or as a gesture of grati-
tude or apology.
While little etiquettes are im-
posed when drinking kava in other
Melanesian and Polynesian cul-
tures, Fijians give a resonant clap,
chanting bula (cheers) before ac-
cepting the bilo, usually a cup made
from a coconut shell, and knock the
bitter drink down in one go. It is
then finished with three claps as a
gesture of gratitude to the server.
You can control the quantity of
grog by uttering a specific, novelty
phrase to the server. This ranges
from low-tide to high-tide, fol-
lowed by tsnami. My memory tells
me – albeit not vividly – that I have
once accepted an ‘ambulance bus’.
For obvious reasons, I can’t remember
much of the evening.
So you like staggering out of a kava
bar not able to walk in a straight line,
drowsily giddy with the sweetest grin
across the face? Join the club bruv.
