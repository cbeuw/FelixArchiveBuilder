Today, felix, I’m going to be... Garrett
Where we ask gamers to tell us about the characters they love to take control of. This week, SKW sneaks in.
S
o I creep, yeah
Just keep it
on the
down
low
Said nobody is sup-
posed to know
Now, don’t get me
wrong. I like being
the hero. I like be-
ing noble, valiant yet
humble; its like I just
stepped out of an old-
fashioned ‘Sign Up
Now’ army poster; I
can almost smell the
apple-pie and freedom
that I’m supposed to be
fighting for.
But there is a limit.
I may say I am vastly
understating it when I
say that games are not
known for their exqui-
site character devel-
opment. Your aver-
age gaming hero is
a one-dimensional
piece of card; a Hol-
lywood cliché lifted
from a thoroughly
indifferent block-
buster. Also – it
might just be said –
cheerfully American,
no matter where their
character is actually
supposed to be from.
That is why I find Gar-
rett, from the Thief series of games,
such a refreshing character to play.
Liberty? Freedom? Garrett doesn’t
care for these idle notions, these in-
tangible ideals. Garrett fights for
no-one but himself, and even
then, he’d prefer to run away
and slip into the shadows.
Garrett is no hero; don’t
you come to him with
your bleeding-heart
tales of woe, your
warnings of a dire evil
that threatens mankind.
Unless you have a damn
good lever on Garrett –
and a reward of a bulg-
ing coin-purse, of course
– Garrett will show you
the door. And pick-pock-
et you on the way out,
naturally.
‘Does Garrett have
no soul, no heart?’ you
might perhaps cry. But
Garrett’s steampunk
world is nothing like
the cut-and-dried
world of less real-
ised games; there is
no black and white
divide between
good and evil in
Garrett’s world.
His city is a mass
of struggling pow-
er blocs, with their
own agendas and plans.
Garrett has truly lived out
the maxim ‘the enemy of my en-
emy is my friend’ in a way, few gaming
heroes get to experience: he knows that
one man’s ‘threat to mankind’ is anoth-
er man’s saviour. After all, he used to be
a member of the Keeper sect; a group
of powerful seers that seek to keep the
city’s power blocs in balance. Chafing
under their restrictive ways, Garrett left
them, and turned their teachings in the
arts of stealth to his own glorious profit.
Garrett is jaded, cynical, wry and
laconic. Garrett’s sarcasm is no fake
bluster, though: he truly would let the
world go hang for a penny.
Garrett is also – lets not beat about
the bush here – pretty damn sexy. The
amount of lascivious fan-fiction writ-
ten about him probably exceeds that
of any other gaming hero. Those other
heroes are usually healthy 6 footers,
defined more by their looks or muscles
than their characters. Garrett is pretty
much an opposing figure; his face is
more interesting than handsome –
hell, he only has one eye (the other is
a mechanical replacement that gleams
eerily). Nevertheless, his dry sarcastic
voice, his ruthless self-servicing ways,
his hard shell, his efficiency... he has
more personality than most games can
manage to create in all their characters
put together, never mind in their hero.
“Does Garrett have
no soul, no heart?”
Other games waste no time in flaunt-
ing their hero’s physique, but Garrett is
hardly ever even seen, let alone going
around strutting his stuff. Loose black
garb and a hood are Garrett’s chosen
wear, not a tight-fitting ‘look at me!’
wardrobe. Garrett is all about mys-
tique. Will his hard shell ever crack,
and let Garrett show anything other
than very, very measured affection for
no one but himself? I devoutly hope
not.
