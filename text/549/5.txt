entering the Mines Review on Wednesday

WIST
Less than half the entrants found out
about the review from the posters a n d
most were not influenced by the type of
poster which suggests that its offensive
nature (a silhouette of a nude woman)
was totally unnecessary.
A similar proportion, under fifty percent
of those questioned would go to a strip
s h o w o u t s i d e of C o l l e g e a n d m a n y
s u g g e s t e d t h a t t h e l a t e b a r l i c e n c e
influenced their d e c i s i o n to a t t e n d the
review rather than the type of entertain-
ment offered.
T h e m e n did not accept that they were
maintaining a stereotype image of a ' m a n '
(nor reinforcing it) (question 6), however
the p a c k i n s t i n c t w a s p r e v a l e n t , w i t h
many people answering in groups; on the
o t h e r h a n d m a n y p e o p l e e n t e r e d , as
stated above, for the bar.
W e , in W I S T , believe that strip shows
hinder any moves towards equality in our
u n i v e r s i t y s o c i e t y . T o w a t c h a s h o w
which displays w o m e n as objects to be
looked at and assessed in terms of their
performance, and then not to translate
t h e s e v a l u e s i n r e l a t i o n s w i t h o t h e r
w o m e n o n the s a m e c o u r s e , t a k e s a
conscious effort. The fact that so many
going to the review saw the stripper as a
w o m a n can be seen as a worrying coment
o n h o w t h e y v i e w w o m e n in g e n e r a l .
Question 7, though, did provoke many to
c o n s i d e r t h e d i f f e r e n c e s b e t w e e n t h e i r
ideas of w o m e n a n d s e x o b j e c t s a n d ,
perhaps, highlighted some of the contra-
d i c t i o n s p u t f o r w a r d i n t h i s s o c i e t y
regarding sexual conditioning.
Yet another contradiction can be seen
in the responses to question 8. relating to
the male stripper. Three quarters of those
asked saw the male stripper as a clown.
W e should next ask: W h y is it that the
male stripper is a figure of ridicule and
the w o m a n stripper not? C o u l d it be to
do w i t h ' s t e r e o t y p e s ' , 'sex r o l e s ' ? W e
suggest that one of the reasons female
strippers are 'exciting' is that a naked
w o m a n is vulnerable and so the men in
the audience can derive a sense of power.
A male stripper however does not depict
a h e l p l e s s c r e a t u r e s . O n e o n l y h a s t o
note that male nudity is often aggressive,
eg, in the cases of flashers and rapists.
Mines may say (and if they don't many
others will) that by having a male stripper
the event b e c o m e s non-sexist because
then women can look at a m a n , but this,
a g a i n , is just a c a s e of m e n w a n t i n g
w o m e n to c o n f o r m to t h e i r i d e a s of
sexuality.
This college has a very unequal ratio of
men to women and as previously stated,
we do not believe such spectacles as the
Mines Review will improve it. The results
of the survey suggest that Mines should
review the need for this type of entertain-
ment in College (on purely economic or
p o p u l a r i t y g r o u n d s if not e g a l i t a r i a n ) .
S u c h events are not warranted (nor
desired) by people in this College and
should not continue.
T o e n d on a slightly different (though
topical) note, the fear with which people
r e g a r d I C W A o r g a n i s i n g w o m e n - o n l y
events (which it does not do anyway) or
events pertaining specifically to w o m e n is
alarming and yet with only eleven w o m e n
out of 186 people entering the review, will
Mines be accused of providing discrimina-
t o r y e n t e r t a i n m e n t ? Is t h i s n o t j u s t
a n o t h e r c o n t r a d i c t i o n h i g h l i g h t i n g
i n e q u a l i t y i n t h i s c o l l e g e ( a n d a n o t h e r
reason for keeping I C W A . . . or else to
disband M i n e s â€” let's be consistent at
least).
