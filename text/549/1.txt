OPPOSITION T O BOAT C L U B TOUR
Opposition is continuing against the Boat
C l u b T o u r . F E L I X was in its final stages of
production when further developments
occurred. O n this front we outline the
background to the discussion and include a
letter from the Imperial College Boat C l u b
Captain, Steve W e b b . A n open letter
written by the Anti-Apartheid G r o u p at I C is
printed on page 2.
A t last Thursday's Results U G M a motion
was discussed relating to the Boat C l u b tour
of S o u t h Africa. T h e meeting turned into a
heated discussion with two amendments
being proposed to the original motion.
H o w e v e r q u o r u m was called before the vote
could be taken on the main motion.
Last Tuesday an initial meeting of the
Anti- Apartheid G r o u p at Imperial College
discussed the present situation of IC Boat
C l u b rowing in S o u t h Africa. T h e y decided
that the following action should be taken:
T h e U n i o n s of colleges and universities
with major rowing clubs have been
contacted informing them of IC Boat C l u b ' s
proposed trip and asking them to boycott
fixtures with I C B C .
A l l colleges and universities with Boat
C l u b s are to be contacted asking them to
demand the withdrawal of I C B C from all
rowing events.
T h e A R A (Amateur Rowing Association)
is to be contacted, demanding the expulsion
of I C B C - the club would no longer be able to
enter any events since all are A R A fixtures.
It was proposed to present a petition,
containing the names of people opposed to
I C B C rowing in S o u t h Africa to the A C C
meeting held yesterday evening.
75 T R O L L E Y S A T IC
As a result of a visit from the assistant Manager
of Mssrs Waitrose Store on Friday 14th March
some 75 or more of their trolleys which were
scattered around the college were collected and
restored to the company. There may be others
still on the campus and the Chief Security Officer,
Mr A D Dawson, has advised that it would be in
the interest of the college to publicise this matter
with a view of encouraging persons to return
them.

Yesterday a meeting was organised by
the newly formed Anti-Apartheid G r o u p at
I C . T h e speaker was S a m R a m s a m y
C h a i r m a n of the S o u t h African Non-Racial
Olympic Committee ( S A N - R O C ) . H e
spoke on the position of sport in S o u t h
Africa a n d pointyed out that racial
integration in sport in S . A . has only taken
place at an international level, not at club
level. H e said that this has been simply a
result of S. African teams being expelled
from international competition in many
sports, which was damaging to the white
population of S. Africa.
A t the end of the meeting, a vote was
taken on the issuing of a press statement to
the student and national press, outlining the
situation, and calling for a boycott of
Imperial College Boat C l u b . This proposal
was accepted by the meeting.
T h o s e present included several members
of IC Boat C l u b who had been invited to
attend by the Anti-Apartheid G r o u p .
T h e letter from the IC Boat C l u b C a p t a i n ,
Steve W e b b :
I feel a lot has been said about the Boat
Club. T o u r to S o u t h Africa. S o it is about
time the record was set straight, since the
opponents seem to throw a lot of
statements and untruths around.
1) T h e Boat C l u b was invited to S o u t h
Africa purely due to its successes over the
last few years. Henley winners 1978, semi
finalists 1979 a n d Southern University
winners 1973-1980. It is a performance with
which we at college should be jointly proud,
how often do you have the best college team
in the country?
2) It has been completely financed from
outside sources with no College or Student
U n i o n help whatsoever.
3) N o n e of the crew, to my knowledge,
support in anyway the Apartheid policy of
S o u t h Africa or any other regime.
4) That in general, people do not approve
