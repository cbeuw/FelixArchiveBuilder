Dear Boat C l u b M e m b e r
W e are writing to urge you
to refuse to go o n the proposed
Boat C l u b trip to S o u t h Africa,
and to argue strongly against
others going. Y o u are no doubt
aware that the S o u t h African
g o v e r n m e n t a d m i n i s t e r s its
country according to the prin-
ciples of apartheid. T h e con-
s e q u e n t d e g r a d a t i o n a n d ex-
ploitation of the majority of the
p o p u l a t i o n m e a n s t h a t it is
u r g e n t t h a t t h e r e s t of t h e
world campaigns against any
activities which may be seen to
c o n d o n e s u c h p o l i c i e s . T h e
system of apartheid has, itself,
brought politics into sport and
W a n t e d : I n f o r m a t i o n as t o
why J o h n Passmore should be
seen steering a car at 30mph
over Vauxhall Bridge without a
d r i v i n g l i c e n s e o n a S u n d a y
morning.
s o it is c o n s i s t e n t t h a t w e
s h o u l d c u t all s p o r t i n g links
with S o u t h Africa.
W e have reluctantly decided
that if the Boat C l u b competes
in S o u t h Africa, we shall pub-
licise the fact and urge other
colleges in the U K to cancel
fixtures with it. This proposed
tour can only be interpreted as
s p i t t i n g in t h e f a c e s of the
majority of the S o u t h African
people.
If y o u w i s h to c o n t a c t us

Dear C o l i n
W h a t s u r p r i s e d m e m o s t
about last week's U n i o n Meeting
was not that over a hundred of
the students present voted to
suspend a group of students
from U n i o n membership, but
t h a t a s i m i l a r n u m b e r ( a n d
presumably, many not present)
did not care about what those
individuals were up to and why
the name of Imperial College was
being soiled by their actions.
F o r those w h o were not there,
let me explain. A n IC team are to
take p a r t in sporting fixtures in a
police state (which is where the
M o s c o w a n a l o g y begins a n d
ends) against teams selected
from a racial minority, before
racially segregated audiences. If
any of the readers of F E L I X find
nothing distasteful in this state of
affairs and nothing disgusting in
the imprisonment and torture of
those who peacefully oppose the
S o u t h A f r i c a n s y s t e m , I find
their humanity very question-
able.
Y o u r s in extreme disgust

W e like going on the boat

heard B i g B e n striking 3 o'clock.
W e h a d a good time in L o n d o n .
W e saw the dusty road that
horses ride o n . W e saw the
smallest police station. W e liked
the m u s e u m and everything in
the m u s e u m .
T h a n k y o u for giving us a very
good tea at your university and
when we got home we felt full up ,
and slept and we will look out for

A N OPEN LETTER
R A G
Well just a quick w o r d this week, but make sure you read the
letters — y o u are appreciated!
Last Friday's party was a success, in that everyone who went
enjoyed it, but not enough people attended — so if you missed a
good night it serves y o u right. M a n y thanks to everyone who did
help though and congratulations to everyone with the enterprise
(sorry, M r Spock!) to produce some excellent fancy dress.
Y o u may think it's all over now, but on the contrary the Rag
Fete is looming large on the horizon. It's on Saturday 3rd M a y
and we need lots of enthusiastic general helpers and people willing
to run stalls. If you're interested drop a note to me in the U n i o n
Office, or come to one of our meetings. They'll be on the first and
second Wednesdays of next term at 7:00pm in the I C W A Lounge.
See you there,
R a e .
Dear Rachel,
We would like to thank you so
m u c h for the Auditory Training
U n i t p r e s e n t e d to A d a m a n d
Benjamin on Saturday last. This
piece of equipment will play a great '
part in teaching them to speak
more clearly. We both thank you
and all the other students concerned
in the fund raising activities who
helped to raise the money for this
Auditory Training Unit.
We would also take this oppor-
tunity of thanking all concerned for
last Saturday's super afternoon.
The children thoroughly enjoyed
the activities and I know that a lot
of hard work went into the planning
and preparation of the day, and the
whole afternoon was a great success.
Once again our sincerest thanks to
all for your support and kindness.
Yours sincerely
Carol and Brian Pike
Dear Miss Snee
I would like to thank you and
your fellow students who organised
the Imperial College Rag on Saturday
8th March, for all the hard work you
did, for the money you have raised
and also for the wonderful afternoon
you gave the deaf children who
attended. It was a joy to see and hear
the pleasure they had in tossing the
caber and in the games which were
so ably demonstrated and played. I
think the great secret was in the ratio
of students to children and the active
and able manner in which you all
communicated with them.
I know that deaf children all over
the country will have good reason
to be grateful to the students of
Imperial College when they receive
the equipment which will have been
bought with the money you have
raised.
Yours sincerely
C h a i r m a n of the National Deaf
Children's Society
