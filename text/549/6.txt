Easter witnesses the greatest show on
earth (well, nearly) in the form of drag
racing (as seen on T V , although not very
often). T h e v e n u e b e i n g the i n f a m o u s
Santa P o d Raceway. D r a g racing began
v e r y h u m b l y as c a r s r a c i n g b e t w e e n
traffic lights in sunny Southern California
and Florida. T h e guys got so fed up of
being harassed by the police, that they
began to use a disused airfield and things
went on from there.
T o d a y drag racing is a booming multi-
million dollar business which is becoming
popular worldwide, having active partici-
pation in at least ten countries. The sport
is b a s i c a l l y a n a c c e l e r a t i o n c o n t e s t ,
between two cars or bikes of about equal
m o d i f i c a t i o n o v e r a s t a n d i n g s t a r t of
quarter of a mile, the winner being the
one who crosses the finish first. Sounds
simple! Don't be fooled, a lot can happen
in such a small distance, things can go
seriously wrong, such as disintegration of
clutch or engine, punctures, tyre shake
(where the tyre only grips the track for
part of a revolution), etc, etc. Y o u don't
have long to react before you hit a solid
guard rail and that's when trouble really
b e g i n s , it d o e s n ' t d o y o u r h e a l t h (or
overdraft) too m u c h good travelling at
over 200mph upside down. However, that
doesn't happen too often.

T h e most important part of a drag race
is the start, if you get off badly there's a
l o t o f w o r k to d o t o c a t c h u p . T h e
starting mechanism being an electronic
light s y s t e m ( C h r i s t m a s tree) the c a r s
being placed between light beams, if you
leave the line before the countdown is
finished you're disqualified. O n a 'legal'
start a clock begins to count your time,
and is terminated when you break a light
beam at the finish line. Y o u r speed is also
r e c o r d e d u s i n g , a f u r t h e r s e t of light
b e a m s p l a c e d t w e n t y feet a p a r t . T h e
clocks are very accurate, the closest race
I've s e e n was one of 0.0001 s e c o n d s
separating the two cars. M o s t races are won
by hundreths of a second.
T h e cars a n d bikes are divided into
classes a n d sub-divided into sub-classes.

Before the actual r u n itself the cars go
t h r o u g h a ' b u r n o u t ' p r o c e s s ; the r e a r
wheels are moved into pools of water,
and the accelerator floored, spinning the
r e a r w h e e l s , m e l t i n g t h e r u b b e r a n d
clearing the tyres. The layer of rubber
which is laid d o w n gives excellent traction
(or grip) off the start line. T o make use'of
this grip and the power available wide
wheels and tyres are used; the tyres are
made useless after no more than three
miles racing. A t the end of a good day's
racing the track can have a good quarter
of an inch of rubber covering the start
line. A t the end of a day the whole strip is
c l e a r e d b y h e a t i n g a n d s c r a p i n g to

T h e main classes:

Light the blue touch paper and run, would
be an ideal comment, so I won't write it.
These cars are definitely exhibition cars, i.e.
they are not allowed to race in pairs,
because of the danger of a high speed
collision followed by possible detonation of
the H y d r o g e n Peroxide (neat) tanks. T o p
m a n is 'slamming' S a m m y Miller of N e w
Jersey in the Vanishing Point Rocket. H i s
quickest run to date being 3.94 sees at 360
m.p.h. over a standing quarter mile. The
rocket is actually a converted lunar lancjing '
module propulsion system (converted from
liquid O x y g e n to Peroxide).
The top racing class is l o p t-uel, the
cars most people associate as dragsters
(if, in fact, they k n o w what a dragster is)
— the l o n g - b o d i e d w i d e r e a r - w h e e l e c
machines, which run on a diet of nitro
m e t h a n e ( e x p l o s i v e ) a n d m e t h a n o l . I
challenge anyone to drink beer as fast as
they do nitro; just about one gallon per
second when in 'full song'. T h e best cars
c a n r u n the q u a r t e r i n just u n d e r s i x
seconds at 245mph plus. T h e cars have
so m a n y s a f e t y f e a t u r e s b u i l t i n , i t ' s
unreal; fire extinguishers, explosion-proof
leak-proof fuel cells, dual parachutes, and
m o r e , g i v i n g t h e m a v e r y safe t r a c k
record.
O n e of the newest a n d most popular
classes is the funny car (effectively short
wheel base T o p Fuel cars with a fibre glass
replica production car bodies). A wolf in
s h e e p ' s c l o t h i n g p u m p i n g ^ o u t o v e r
2,000bhp ' w h i c h shake the ground, and
can be felt, for a good hundred feet, thus
t h e e f f e c t of ' b r a i n s h a k a g e ' is a l s o
k n o w n , this is nothing to do with D P s ,
but an effect where the scalp and brain
m o v e i n d i f f e r e n t d i r e c t i o n s d u e to
resonances set up a n d is quite fun.

Handling can also be quite a problem
as you may well imagine with the power
of four f o r m u l a one c a r s o n t a p . T h e
European cars are nearly as good as the
A m e r i c a n cars (5.95sec/246mph).
There are six other major classes which
a r e s u b - d i v i d e d i n t o as m a n y as 52
c a t e g o r i e s i n t h e c a s e of p r o d u c t i o n
which is 'normal' cars merely tuned up.
T o p Fuel and F u n n y C a r s use many
specialist parts, such as aluminium engine
blocks for lightness or iron engine blocks
for reliability depending on which you can
afford. Exotic metals are used for internal
p a r t s . S p e c i a l i s t p a r t s g e n e r a l l y c o m e

D r a g Racing gains its popularity from the
friendliness at each meeting—where in
F o r m u l a 1 Racing could you go into the pits
and talk to the drivers about their cars etc.
After all the top men can earn quite a lot
each year (over $400,000 in the case of
R a y m o n d Beadle, driver of the famed Blue
M a x F u n n y C a r , a n d thats in sponsorship
alone) yet they still find time to talk to the
paying public.
D r a g Racing gets into your blood; once
you've tryed it you can't give it up. there is
always so m u c h action, be it o n the strip or
in the pits.
