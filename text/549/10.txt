ULU CUP FINAL
Last W e d n e s d a y at M o t s p u r Park
saw the highlight of what was for IC
H o c k e y C l u b an o t h e r w i s e p o o r
season: the University of London C u p
Final.
We arrived in g o o d time for the
start, in s p i t e of the c o a c h d r i v e r
taking what can only be described as
the 'scenic' route, to be greeted by
about twenty percent of Wye College,
along side which the small contingent
of quiet, but confident, IC supporters
seemed quite insignificant.
T h e m a t c h eventually started on
time, and all eyes were on the diminutive
figure of Poon Foke Loke, our'imported'
M a l a y s i a n i n t e r n a t i o n a l , w h o with
almost his first touch of the ball place an
inch-perfect pass through Wye defence
to the left wing. This led to a cross that
found the veteran Bob Middleton totally
free at the top of the circle. With the goal
at his mercy Bob mishit the ball wide.
Minutes later, however, following a
long c o r n e r , P o o n weaved his way
through the defence and slotted the ball
into the net to open the scoring.
Though controlling the centre of the
field IC were unable to capitalise on their
early lead, and were often troubled by
some speedy wing play which seemed to
impress the snoozing Daily Telegraph
reporter.
The rest of the half produced no
dangerous attacks by either side and the
only excitement was provided by the
o p p o s i t i o n ' s r o w d y s u p p o r t a n d
Shirley Coarse's wellies.
In the s e c o n d half W y e C o l l e g e
survived an early onslaught by the IC
attack, before the game settled down
into its earlier pattern of IC midfield
domination, but with a lack of punch in
the attack. With less than fifteen minutes
to go, Tony de Barr decided to wake
up, which resulted in more effective
front r u n n i n g a n d a s u c c e s s i o n of
penalty corners.
Bob Middleton was unlucky not to
score when, after a series of fouls by
Wye defenders at the top of the circle,
he beat the goalkeeper. But before he
could shoot into the empty goal the
u m p i r e gave a short c o r n e r for the
earlier infringements.
Up till now IC's short corner routine
had been very disappointing, caused
mainly by the absence of an effective
hand-stopper, but Chris Ftielly's neat
stick-stop and subsequent sidestep of
the o n - c o m i n g defender left him a
clear shot at goal w h i c h m a d e the
score 2-0.
Minutes later, in the dying moments
of the match, Bob was up-ended in
the circle and Chris Rielly competently
converted the inevitable penalty flick,
making the final score a deserved, but
not inpressive, 3-0.
After the match there was a little bit
of subdued celebration during which
Phil Webb inexplicably decided to take
off his t r o u s e r s in o r d e r to drink a
yard in the Union Bar.
Team: G Corbin, I Crowe, R Davey,
C Rielly, P Hughes, T de Barr (Capt),
Poon Foke Loke, G Forbes, L Rich, R
Middleton and J Afilaka.

BOAT CLUB
In the second half of this term, the
Boat C l u b has c o m p e t e d in several
events.
The first of these was the Henley IVs
H e a d , where we entered four m e n s
and two ladies' crews. N o n e of the
mens crews did as well as they could
have d o n e , a l t h o u g h three of t h e m
c a m e in the first eleven. T h e girls'
crew finished third in their division.
Next was Reading Head of the River
R a c e , w h e r e t h r e e m e n s a n d one'
ladies VII Is were entered. The mens
first VIII f i n i s h e d s e v e n t h o v e r a l l ,
d e s p i t e b e i n g h i n d e r e d by s l o w e r
boats starting in front of them. T h e
second VIII finished equal eighteenth,
only nine seconds behind their class
winners, and although the novice VIII
rowed well, they were no match for
fitter school crews. The ladies probably
did better than the other IC crews,
finishing fourth in the ladies division,
behind two national squad crews and
the Oxford University Ladies VIII, and
beating the U L L a d i e s First VIII by
twenty-one seconds.
Last Wednesday, 12th March, four
c r e w s e n t e r e d t h e U n i v e r s i t y of
London Head of the River Race, for
U L c o l l e g e s . In the a b s e n c e of the
mens first VIII, the IC second VIII won
the event o u t r i g h t , b e a t i n g K i n g s
College I into second place by twenty
seconds. The mens novice VIII, rowing
better on their home water, finished'
fifteen seconds behind their division
winner. A University College crew,
rumoured to be the U L VIII, withdrew
f r o m the l a d i e s e v e n t at t h e last
m i n u t e , p o s s i b l y b e c a u s e of t h e i r
defeat at Reading. This meant that IC I
only had to beat IC II to win the Sir
C e c i l P h i l i p s P l a t e , f o r t h e t h i r d
successive time. Yet again IC proved
their dominance of U L college rowing.
On Saturday, the ladies VIII competed
in the K i n g s t o n H e a d of the River
Race. The home crew's knowledge of
the c o u r s e p r o v e d to be a d e c i s i v e
f a c t o r , w i t h t h e K i n g s t o n l a d i e s
beating IC into second place by only
e i g h t s e c o n d s , o v e r a t w e n t y - t w o
minute course.
Tomorrow, the men's first, second
and novice VII Is are competing in one
of the m a j o r e v e n t s in the r o w i n g
calendar; the Head of the River Race
from Mortlake to Putney. Four hundred
a n d t w e n t y c r e w s , i n c l u d i n g t h e
national squad and several overseas
crews, will be taking part, and IC hope
to do as well as last year when they
finished sixteenth and thirty-first.
