EDITORIAL
Eye witnesses described my
accident by saying that I looked
like a crazed circus acrobat
cartwheeling down towards the
Sherfield building. I may have
been in a topsy turvy situation a
month ago but 1 intend to stick to
my guns on the subject of
sporting links with South
Africa. All sport should be
allowed to continue, no matter
where or with whom the games
are played. I am a proud holder of
Rugby colours for a South
African team. I support the Boat
Club's tour of South Africa.'
I wish the Rugby club well'in
their present tour of Holland.

The manager of Mssrs Waitrose Store
Gloucester Road is very concerned about the
large number of shopping trolleys not returned to
the store after being taken home by customers.
Following a visit to the college by his assistant
Manager on Friday 14th March approximately 75
of these trolleys were recovered from various
parts of the campus and restored to the firm. It
was pointyed out by the Assistant Manager that
his firm had in the recent past instituted a number
of prosecutions against customers for illegally
retaining the trolleys but this was not his objective
on this occasion. T h e purchase price of these
trolleys is £30.00 and the firm were in fact were in
fact very pleased to recover so many. Many of
these trolleys have been used around the college
for different purposes and it may be that there are
still a number which have not yet been recovered.
Persons currently in possession of these trolleys
are advised to take them to the Beit Quadrangle
where the Students Union Administrator Mrs Jen
Hardy Smith will arrange for them to be returned
to the owners. Failure to return one of these
trolleys could place the person found in
possession of it at the risk of a criminal
prosecution.
