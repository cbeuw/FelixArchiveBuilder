of sport being used as a weapon for political
p u r p o s e s , a s c a n be s e e n f r o m
the recent opinion polls, that 75% of people
reject the call for an O l y m p i c boycott, a n d
the union policy is, at this moment in favour
of all sporting contacts with all Nations,
colours and creeds.
5) That the motion of the Anti-Apartheid
G r o u p at Imperial College, has found 300
odd signatures in several days which
amounts to about 6% of active students!!
This hardly seems to be a " s t o r m of
protests" which M a r y and her cronies have
put on their Press release to the student
Newspapers and a few Nationals!
6) That all the channels for application
were gone thro' i.e. A C C - C o u n c i l - U G M s
and there were no official changes of policy
to instruct us not to go. N o w after all has
been arranged threats of retaliation are
being voiced by an unofficial organisation
calling itself the Anti-Apartheid group at
Imperial College.
In conclusion I would like to appeal to all
students at college (especially those of y o u
who enjoy sport) to try and show the
student politicians amongst us that we are
not prepared to be instructed what to do
and who to play against but to leave the
decision up to the individuals w h o play the
game.
I would also like to say that I went ahead
with this tour in the honest belief that it
would be a good thing for the college, a n d
our sportsmen, in general, with no intention
ever to show support for any Political
System.

the U n i o n were admitted a n d
engaged in a conversation with
an Embassy official. H e made
the point that they would not
accept the petition as it dealt
with an internal Russian affair.
A f t e r m u c h a r g u m e n t t h e
official stood firm in his stand
against accepting the petition.
W h i l s t t w o of t h e p a r t y
engaged the official in obtaining
t h e a d d r e s s of t h e R u s s i a n
Minister of the Interior a third
discreetly 'left' the file containing
the petition. A t this point all of
the students left.
Thus, though not accepted,

'Russian soil'.
This protest was organised in
conjunction with the nationally
