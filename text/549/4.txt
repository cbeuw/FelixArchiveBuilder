THE GREAT IMPERIAL RAG RACE: FINALE
After C h a p t e r T w o last week, it falls to
the undeniably bionic superhuman R C S
c o l l e c t o r s t o f i n a l l y s e t t h e r e c o r d
s t r a i g h t . T h e d i a b o l i c a l i n j u s t i c e s a n d
blatant propaganda were perpetrated not
b y u s b u t b y I a n t h e " A n o n y m o u s
G u i l d s m a n " .
T h e feats of the immortal few G u i l d s m e n
(sic) were e x p o u n d e d with a noted seif-
c o n f e s s e d l a c k of m o d e s t y . W h a t w a s
modestly forgotten w a s that the jolly band
from C h e m E n g 1 were bolstered by the
addition of a n R C S person to their ranks.
Indeed, were it not for D I E C O O K J A W
( y e s , w e t o o c a n p r o d u c e u s e l e s s
anagrams), the doyenne of C h e m 1, the
C h e m E n g team would have sunk into
ugly obscurity. T h e apparent R C S cock-
up at the start was only due to the fact
that the I C R a g C o m m i t t e e , a n d indeed
most of those w h o attend Rag Committee
meetings, are R C S persons. Perhaps a
point for o u r G u i l d s m a n elect chairman to
bear in mind.
S o we c o m e to the travels of Deviant
doing it his way over eight hundred miles.
Eight hundred miles a n d Rolls Royces do
not make a hero of modern times. W e
showed the stuff which m e n are made is
S c o t c h , crisps a n d nearly one thousand
miles of continual travel.
Besides, what did Deviant do when he
got to Perth? Nothing! H e just turned
round a n d headed home. T h e great long
distance R C S R a g machine left Dundee
r e e l i n g u n d e r a n o n s l a u g h t u p o n t h e i r
d e f e n c e l e s s w o m e n i n t h e i r u n i v e r s i t y
halls.
But what of the future? A R a g race
sometime i n the first term of next year
should see us with a complete supply of
Rag M a g s for everybody to overrun the
country. R u m o u r has it that this year's
real c h a m p i o n s (ie R C S ) a r e g o i n g t o
head for a N o r t h S e a oil rig, or failing
t h a t , t h e B i g A p p l e a c r o s s t h e p o n d .
Should B E 1 like to learn h o w to Rag race
properly (eg, one thousand miles gone,
two hundred a n d thirty-seven R a g M a g s
sold by one person, etc) they k n o w where
to c o m e for lessons.
Yours heroically,
M & S (not the clothes shop, but Matt
and Steve)
(For those of y o u readers w h o think this
i n t e r - C C U slagging is going a bit far, don't
worry, we're only doing it for the kiddies.)
