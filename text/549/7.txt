Election day at Illogos College was
even more bizzare than usual. F o r
when the tellers came to tot up the
votes cast for the post of U n i o n
President, they found to their surprise
and bewilderment that many of the
voters had ignored the three names
on the ballot sheet, a n d had inscribed
an extra one. Indeed, their perplexity
increased when it was realised that
this u n k n o w n nominee, whose name
was M r L a m p o o n , had been elected
to the presidential post.
Apparently, during the previous
night, some agent provocateur h a d
plastered the walls of the college with
propaganda in support of the mysterious
candidate. T h e seminal originality of
the art-work o n these posters had
been inspired; a n d it was for this
reason alone that many of the voters
had pledged their alliance with M r
L a m p o o n in preference to his
opponents, whose election propaganda
had been rancid with cant. Although
this was the general consensus of
opinion, one girl said that it had
been his F r e n c h sounding name that
had appealed to her, while another
fellow insisted that it had been M r
L a m p o o n ' s Marxist bent that had
swung the election his way.
All the same, whatever the pitch of
the man's policies, it didn't help the
union executive to discover the 'true
identity or the whereabouts of this
fictitious president-elect. F o r three
hours after the result w a s k n o w n , a
fierce debate ensued between the past
president, the returning officer a n d
the chief teller. W i t h their customary
unanimity, each suggested a radically
different solution to their predicament.
T h e n suddenly, w h e n the whole
election seemed in grave danger of
being reduced to the level of a
comic farce, a deus ex machina
appeared in the guise of a tattily
dressed, unshaven fellow w h o just
seemed to materialise o u t of the
L o n d o n smog.
With great gesticulations, he
introduced himself as B r u n o , apologised
for being so late, then announced that he
was none other than M r L a m p o o n ' s
political agent. M r L a m p o o n , he
explained, would not be available until
the following morning, when he,
B r u n o , would gladly accompany the
union officers to meet h i m . H e then
requested that they assemble outside
the gates of Whipsnade Z o o , since
this was in close proximity to
L a m p o o n ' s party H Q .
The next morning, the three union
officers met up with the eccentric
B r u n o , w h o arrived carrying a c o p y
of the morning edition of the
Grorniad, a b u n c h of ripe bananas
a n d a c a n of anti-fly spray. Their
consternation over this was not
allayed when B r u n o bought four;
entrance tickets t o the z o o , yet this
was nothing in comparison to the
shock that awaited them.
B r u n o led them to the chimpanzee
cage, doffed his cap to the hairy
male inside it, then, without the bat
of an eyelid, handed him the
newspaper, the bananas and the anti-
fly spray. "This, gentleman," B r u n o
said, "is L a m p o o n , your president-
elect." T h e three union officers had
some difficulty digesting this morsel of
information. They stood as if transfixed to
the ground, a n d stared stupidly at the
animal, w h o meanwhile had consumed
the eight bananas, and was busily
searching out the sports page in the
newspaper. Behind him, six or seven
female chimps romped and loped around
the cage.
The m a n w h o received the brunt of
their anger a n d confusion was, of course,
B r u n o . H o w could L a m p o o n be president
when he wasn't even a h u m a n , let alone a
student, they cried. B r u n o parried this
objection by presenting them with
L a m p o o n ' s student union card . . .
complete with photograph a n d authentic
stamp. Y e t numerous other objections
were raised; h o w would the feminist
movement react when it became k n o w n
that L a m p o o n had a dozen or so wives . .
. . after all, to the G r e e r s of this world,
polygamy is about as popular as celibacy
in a bordello. B r u n o , w h o disliked the
smell of prejudice, could see no
connection between a man's sexual
appetite a n d his politics.
A n y w a y , B r u n o insisted that all these
impediments were illusory; L a m p o o n had
won the election, that was all that
mattered. Besides, he was sure that
L a m p o o n ' s charismatic personality and
insouciant smile would carry all before
him.
After several hours of disputation,
Bruno's eloquence and profound faith in
his prodigy had convinced the executive
that L a m p o o n ' s potential as a president
was unrivalled. Nevertheless, they
decided it would be prudent not to break
the news of L a m p o o n ' s identity to the
curious public until the next day, when an
E G M would be arranged. T h e n the
president could be introduced in person,
and a formal inauguration could take
place. A t this point, B r u n o indicated that
L a m p o o n ' s release was imminent . . . i n
fact, he h a d been carrying out a
sociological study during his stay at
Whipsnade, which h a d been completed.
Thus, the following day, B r u n o led
L a m p o o n before an aghast audience of
students. O f course, L a m p o o n realised
that he was the centre of attention, a n d
with the dramatic sense of a w o m a n ,
danced around the floor doing
summersaults. Finally, to the furore of the
assembled company, he demonstrated his
incredible gymnastic abilities by swinging
from chandelier to chandelier, a n d with
one enormous leap, landed in the
presidential chair.
B r u n o eventually managed to placate
his high spirits with the aid of a b u n c h of
bananas. B u t the next problem arose
when L a m p o o n was handed a fountain
pen with which he was to sign the
inauguration document. This seemingly
straightforward task was made all the
more hazardous by L a m p o o n ' s mis-
chievous insistence o n squirting ink over
the union officers. E a c h time the pen
ejected a long silvery blue discharge of
ink, a roguish grin would spread across
his hairy face, a n d his open lips would
reveal a set of dazzlingly white gnashers

N o w , these outrageous events occured
over a week ago. D u r i n g this time, all the
disputes, wrangles, points a n d counter-
points over Lampoon's hedgemony have
been dissipated by those two great
redemptive features of any democratic
system â€” apathy a n d resentment. While
most of the students have sunk back into
their previous state of intemperance a n d
debauchery, a few have begun to cast
aspersions o n the new president. O n e
particularly vitriolic attack was aimed at
Lampoon's policies a n d in the apparently
haphazard way in which they were
formulated. In all honesty, it was being
said that the president was more
concerned about the importation a n d
exportation of peanuts a n d bananas than
about the welfare of his students.
Obviously, y o u will agree that such
libellous accusations are both unfounded
and unjustified.

In addition, it was being claimed in
some circles that L a m p o o n ' s manifesto
was written on and hidden inside a
nutshell, which he keeps hidden
somewhere about his person, a n d from
which he occasionally takes a little nibble.
During the past few days, L a m p o o n has
been o n a concentrated field study of the
nearby Jekyll Park. Indeed, at this precise
moment in time, his exact whereabouts
are not k n o w n . S o m e say that he's
meditating in solitude o n the world's
problems, while other more skeptical
observers suggest that he's galivanting
about the grasslands like a sandboy a n d
practising some novel acrobatic trick with
which to enrapture the next U G M .
