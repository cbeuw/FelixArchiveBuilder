The Selecter package got to London on
M o n d a y amidst a welter of p u n k s ,
skinheads and mods, all busy bopping
frantically away.
First on were the Swinging Cats, who
played a good solid set of sixties revamps
with an excellent swirl organ, very much
to the fore, even if the rest of the band
had left their notes at home. The
Bodysnatchers, an all-female band, were
much better; playing a wide range of
reggae revival, but mainly their own
material including the single Ready,
Steady, Go. Everyone was well warmed
up by now and ready for the Selecter,
who were incredible.
I have never seen a band so tight or so
hot. Within minutes the whole crowd was
leaping about, and two kids had been
unceremoniously dumped by the bouncers.
They are a seven piece multi-racial outfit
playing what can best be described as
'fusion music'. Whatever it is, it's great to
dance to! The songs went through in
rapid succession; Danger, Three Minute
Hero, Too Much Pressure, Street
Feeling and It Makes Me Mad amongst
others. A lot of the songs are about racial
and class tension, and the need for black,
white, skin and punk to get together, stop
fighting and have some fun. This worked
with most people, who were bopping
themselves stupid by this time, apart from
a small section of skinheads who chanted
slogans now and then.
The band came on for three encores,
including the obligatory On My Radio, a
ska version of James Bone and a final
version of Madness with the Bodysnatchers
RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB
As is customary at |his time of year, the
Rifle Club organised three inter-CCU rifle
and pistol competitions. The first, the full
bore competition for the Jocelyn Thorpe
Cup was shot last Sunday at the NRA
camp Bisley. Two targets were shot at
three hundred and six hundred yards, with
the best five out of six to count, giving the
maximum possible team scores of 500.
Visabiity was good, but a fresh, blustery
cross-wind was blowing which caused a
tew problems for the less experienced
members of the teams.
City and Guilds won with the following
results.

back on stage to join in. The reception was
fantastic. The crowd went frantic all the
time they were on. If "you like the Two-
Tone scene, something to bop to, or just
a bloody good time, make sure you catch
them at the other London date, this
Saturday at the Lewisham Odeon.

Last Friday, at Kensington Town Hall,
Imperial College Choir gave a performance
of Bach's St Matthew's Passion. They sang,
augmented by members of the choirs of
Mary Dafchelor Girls' School and Notting
Hill and Ealing High School, under the
e x p e r i e n c e d baton of Eric B r o w n ,
accompanied by a special orchestra with
leaders John Bacon and Penelope Howard.
The change of venue (choir concerts are
usually held in the Great Hall, Sherfield)
was agreeable, producing a magnificent
sound, although the red brick and lights
produced something of a kiln effect for both
performers and audience.
In this superb work, the full emotion of the
Passion came through, beginning with the
rulers conspiring against Christ and
following the story until the burial of Jesus.
The soloists experienced difficulties in some
parts of the performance, but on the whole
they did very well, and John Tudhope as the
Evangelist gave a particularly memorable
and excellent performance. ,
I think regular attenders of choir concerts
would agree that, although this was perhaps
not technically the best concert they had
ever given, it was however very moving and
enjoyable. Partly due to the large size of the
c h o i r , the entries were w o o l l y a n d
sometimes weak, but the fullness of the

On Wednesday afternoon the .22 prone
rifle competition was shot for the Courtman
Shield, followed by the pistol competition
(for which there is no trophy at present) in
the evening. Both competitions were held
in the rifle range in the Sports Centre.
The Courtman Shield was the closest
competition for years. Teams of six each
shooting two cards with the best five to
count gave each team a maximum of 1,000
points. Each team shot very well with
Guilds only beating Mines and RCS by
three and five points respectively. Unfor-
tunately for Mines it is still not good
enough to win their captain a pot in the
Union Bar (which requires them to win the
Courtman Shield), . . . perhaps next year.
The Pistol was far less competitive with
only Mines and RCS with any sort of pistol
shooters The teams shot 5 x 2 cards with
the best four to count and the non-existant
trophy eventually going to Mines.
The final results were as follows.

sound they made during the choruses
almost made up for this.
For me, the most memorable and moving
part of the performance was the beautiful
chorale When I Am Close To Dying, which
the choir sang unaccompanied. This and the
final chorus In Tears Of Grief made the
whole concert worthwhile.
Despite it being a lengthy performance, it
was most enjoyable, and congratulations
should go to choir, soloists, orchestra and
conductor for such a moving rendering.

D R A M S O C
Last week D R A M S O C put on a play, 'We
can't pay? We won't pay!' Ironically the plot
centred on a group of women who took
goods from a local supermarket. The
publicity was based on the Waitrose bag
design. The play was produced by Peter Ed
and was fun to watch. All the company were
polished in their performances and I enjoyed
the chance to relax for a tew moments.
