I.C. entered two crews i n the University of London
Vinter VIII's Regatta on Saturday Dee. 4th., one i n
the Senior and one in ths Junior division. We nan-
-aged to win the day convincingly, taking both the
Senior and Junior events.
The Junior crew beat two King's crews in their f i r s t
two heats. In the third heat they had a dead-heat
with St. Georges Hospital, but beat them by a canvas
In the re-row. aye witness, accounts say that they
were half a length down some half a minute from the
finish; they then disappeared in a flurry of foam
and spray, and emerged In tha lead I In the final
they beat a good King's orew.
The Senior crew beat the London Hospital • A "
orew i n their f i r s t heat quite comfortably. They
then beat Q.u.a. " A • crew easily. In the seml-fin-

the start, but I.C. settled down very well and drew
away to win by 14 lengths. They then went on to win
the Final by beating U.C.& H by 3 length.

S O C C E R / c FORWARDS STILL GOAL SHY
Since the last Issue of FELIX two Important
League games have been won. Kings were defeated
. 4 - 2 and a vary closely eontaated match with
Westminster resulted i n a 3 - 2 victory. This
xatter result had one pleasing and one disturbing
feature. After being two goals up, the I.C. team
was l u l l e d Into a state of complacency and the
motions of football ware gone through at l i t t l e
•ore than half pace, whioh resulted i n tha Wost-
-ralnster team snatching two goals. Tha redeeming
feature then occurred; a l l complacency vanished .
and tha team attacked, with real vigour. At this
onslaught ths Westminster defence cracked and I.C.
won nuoh more easily than tha eoore .suggests.
Wastainstar are the opponents i n the next round
Of the U.L. cup ( to be at Harllngton on Dec 11th

Since their elimination from the University"Cup,
the Increasing t o l l of injuries may be responsib-
l e for the I.C. team's somewhat mixed fortunes.
I.C. did well to reverse the result of previous
years when they defeated Westminster Hospital at
Cobham by 9 pts to 3 pts on a rain soaked pitch.
The forwards playing with a l i t t l e more s p i r i t
than of late fed their backs amply and two tries
from Spencer on the wing clinched the game i n the
second half.
The following Saturday, against Sutton Ex.1st XV,
I.C. played with the gale behind them i n the f i r s t
half but failed to take f u l l advantage of the opp-
o r t u n i t i e s which the conditions afforded them.
Three tries gave I.C. a 9 pt lead at half time, but
In the second half, the Sutton' side showed how best
use could be made of the wind and i t was not long
before they scored a try which was converted,
Playing almost entirely In their own half for the
remainder of the game, the I.C. defence held until
the last minutes when Sutton again crossed the line
but failed with the deciding oonversion.
St.Mary'O College defeated I.C. by two penalty
goals and a try to a try/ at Twickenham In a hard
fought game. Again I.C. did not use the wind in the
f i r s t half and so at the interval the scores-were
level, each side having scored one try. The play"
of the I.C. pack Improved a l i t t l e i n the second
half, and their baeks came near to scoring on a few
occasions. Neither line was crossed again however,
but two fine penalty goals gave St. Mary's the .
match.
