"Send i n a crossword" was the ory.
I t c a l l e d to me, I thought I'd t r y .
My f l a g g i n g b r a i n I took by storm
T h i n k i n g wonders t o perform.
The f i r s t - m a d e c l u e i t seemed t o me
Required a word w i t h l e t t e r s t h r e e .
But then I thought a g a i n of those
To whom the problems I might pose-
You, and you, and you and you,
And you and you and I.C.W.A. t o o .
Of the t r i a l and t r i b u l a t i o n
Of audience p a r t i c i p a t i o n I
For- t o the Guildsmen. i n t h e i r specs
The only answer would be SEX.
While miners, men of simple tongue
(The b i g g e s t rogues as y e t unhung),
Would simply answer — — I and though
T h i s has f o u r l e t t e r s , in. t'would go.
And"if the space was not enough

They'd f i g h t w i t h the c o n s t a b u l a r y
And need but s m a l l vooabulary.
Brownbaggers of the H.O.S.
Would not have time a t a l l u n l e s s
The Board of Governors ( L o r d Save U s i )
Put crosswords on t h e i r s y l l a b u s .
(.Strange t h i n g they don't, f o r t h e n I t h i n k
T'would but r e q u i r e the k i t c h e n s i n k
To make t h e l i s t complete and send
Those t o i l i n g beggars round the bend.)
That only l e a v e s the l a d i e s , who,
Content t o d w e l l i n I.C.W.A. zoo,
t
Know o n l y one t h r e e - l e t t e r word
And t h a t i s MEN, or so I've heard.
Though p'raps some poor i l l i t e r a t e t h e r e -
Dumb blonde, b r u n e t t e or red of h a i r ,
Would t h i n k the answer was I DO.

Moved by the i n t e n s i t y of h i s gaze her l a s h e s
