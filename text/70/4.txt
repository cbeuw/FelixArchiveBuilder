We a r e r e g u l a r patrons of the I.C. Bar and,

We were, as i s our wont, e n j o y i n g a few p i n t s

crowd o f j u v e n i l e hop goers who, a p a r t from c l o g -

customers, smashed a g l a s s on the f l o o r .
May .\e sugcest t h a t i n f u t u r e tne t r u n s i t o r y

Dear P e l i x Ed., i n your l a s t No.
Appeared an e r r o r c o n c e r n i n g Bo.
A moment's thought and y o u ' l l agree.
One can't c a l l a Boanerges "She".
That's a l l f o r now, f o r g i v e these moans,
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,

Dear S i r ,
Strong ment tremble, and P r e s h e r s grub t h e i r
bat_e and run, under Cassandra's v i o l e n t a t t a c k
on the s p e c i e s . ±he words echo through the R.C.S-
T h i s woman demands blood. How oan t h i s woman
be appeased? S h a l l we throw her a F r e s h e r once
^ li?
T h i s problem S i r has now been solved. Some-
one must wed t h i s fiendr, must renounce beer with
b tja and Saturday n i g h t hops, so that he may
t ner the e r r o r of her ways. I , S i r , am
, • upured to make the supreme s a c r i f i c e , to martyr
myself that my fellow-men may 'sleep soundly i n
i,their) beds. I w i l l i p u t SWSjr my beer-mug, and
take down my hot-water b o t t l e . No f l o w e r s , p l e a s e .
Yours, Galahad
P.3. Altnough I have no t e r y l ene socks or
nyloh s h i r t , I do posses two p a i r s of
ouuin-mail combs.
GHOST STORY
There was a wispy waviness about the
wutnr and an ethereal q u a l i t y about the late
iifternoon a i r . The t h i n Deoember sun oast
sparkles from the chalk c l i f f s where the
man was standing, and behind him the green
downs r o l l e d seemingly e n d l e s s l y . The man
saw a l l t h i s ; and more b e s i d e s . He saw a
woman, h i s newly-wedded w i f e , smooth and
lovely beside him on the o l i f f . He saw the
c l i f f - e d g d crumble and go crashing t o the
rocks below. He saw his w i f e b«low, crushes
and b l e e d i n g i n the shallow sea. He saw i t
as i t happened, Just a year ago.
He stood awhile and watched. And as he
watebed he saw his wife again. l o t brush* 1

CHRISTMAS STORY
Once upon a time there was a g i g a n t i c maze or
L a b y r i n t h , on the left-hand s i d e as you go down
E x h i b i t i o n Road, and every year there came to t h i s
L a b y r i n t h young men and maidens who devoted years
of t h e i r l i v e s to p e n e t r a t i n g to i t s c e n t r e .
Strange t a l e s were t o l d o f the p i t f a l l s l u r k i n g
w i t h i n and o f the t e r r i b l e death by ploughing
which awaited those who l o s t t h e i r way through,
r e l y i n g on C a r t e s i a n c o - o r d i n a t e s when they s h o u l d
have been i n homogenous p o l a r s , o r who got out o f
t h e i r depth i n the wave equation. But t h i s was
as n o t h i n g to the h o r r o r s r e p o r t e d to await those
who at l a s t reached the centre o f the L a b y r i n t h .
A monster was reputed to l i v e t h e r e , who s u b j e c t e d
those who met him to a t e r r i b l e Ordeal by Examina-
t i o n , from which the s t r o n g e s t emerged t r e m b l i n g
and b a b b l i n g i n c o h e r e n t l y . T h e i r c o l l e a g u e s shook
t h e i r heads i n d i s t r e s s over the poor, obsessed
c r e a t u r e s who were once human beings and c a l l e d
them "Mathematicians." For years t h i s went on,
the f l o w e r o f the land being transformed i n t o sub-
human wrecks, u n t i l one day there a r r i v e d a man
outstanding among h i s peers. H i s d i f f e r e n t i a l s
were p e r f e c t , h i s f u n c t i o n s were not o n l y con-
tinuous but monotonic, and the s p a r k l e which came
and went i n h i e eyes was i n d e s c r i b a b l e , save as
the sum o f an i n f i n i t e s e r i e s o f s i n e s and
c o s i n e s .
Now the monster i n the centre o f the maze
kept c e r t a i n hand-maidens to m i n i s t e r to him, f o r
h i s food c o n s i s t e d s o l e l y of punched c a r d s , and i t
was h i s maiden's duty to arrange the h o l e s i n the
cards i n a p a t t e r n c a l c u l a t e d to whet h i s a p p e t i t e
One o f these maidens was g r e a t l y s t r u c k w i t h the
beauty o f the young man: she admired him as,
e a r t h - s t a i n e d and spade I n hand, he grubbed among
the r o o t s o f q u i n t i o equations: she p i t i e d him
as, t r a v e l - w o r n and weary, he stumbled on to a
graph, c l u t c h i n g a u n i t p o l e he had brought from
i n f i n i t y . He, i n h i s t u r n , was not i n s e n s i b l e to
her beauty and at l a s t they d e c l a r e d t h e i r l o v e .
She Bet h e r s e l f to h e l p her beloved to the best of
her a b i l i t y , so much so that h i s mentors were
amazed by h i s f i r m grasp of the b r a f u n c t i o n , and
h i s account of the "Moments o f an I n p u l s i v e
Couple" was e a g e r l y sought a f t e r , e s p e c i a l l y a f t e r
i t WBS banned i n Swindon.
At l a s t the time a r r i v e d f o r the student to
venture t o the very centre of the L a b y r i n t h . Be-
fore he l e f t , h i s lover t o l d him what to expect
and gave him f u l l I n s t r u c t i o n s on how to d e a l w i t h
I t ; yet even so he was a p p a l l e d at the loathsome
creature he found there - an Automatic D i g i t a l
Computer, t e r r i b l e among i t s networks and banks of
valves. As i t caught s i g h t of h i s s h r i n k i n g
f i g u r e , the A.B.C. gnashed i t s r e l a y s i n g l e e and
c r i e d (by means of an Ingenious mechanism f u l l y
described i n another paper):
"What have we here? Another puny m o r t a l oome
to p i t I t s f e e b l e b r a i n a g a i n s t me; I t won't take
long to t u r n you i n t o a r a v i n g mathematician."
And a l l i t s v a l v e f i l a m e n t s glowed w i t h p l e a s u r e .
"I'm going to g i v e you a problem" I t s a i d , "and
you must get the answer before I do, and you w i l l
stay here u n t i l you win. Quick now; a man takes
a random walk on a E u c l i d e a n plane and between
each step he takes a d r i n k o f whisky. What i s
h i s p o s i t i o n a f t e r a thousand steps, t a k i n g h i s
i n i t i a l P 0 8 l
t l o n as o r i g i n ? " Almost a t once there
was a t e r r i b l e c l a t t e r o f r e l a y s and i t gave the
answer.
"Come, come, you must t r y harder" i t s a i d
smugly. "Take an e a s i e r one . . . "
Dimly, i n his confused b r a i n , the student
remembered h i s i n s t r u c t i o n s .
" I s n ' t i t my turn to put a question now?" he
s a i d .
The A.D.C. r a i s e d i t s f l i p - f l o p s i n s u r p r i s e .
"No one e l s e has ever asked f o r a turn.
S t i l l , " i t chuckled, " I don't see why not. Ask
away, "
"What," s a i d the student nervously, " i s the
exact value o f "JT?"
"3"1U15 ..." began the computer and continued
s t e a d i l y a t the r a t e of two hundred and twenty-two
d i g i t s a minute. The student l i s t e n e d to i t f o r
h a l f an hour and then s t o l e away, e smile on his
face. The computer would never t r o u b l e students
again.
The student and the maiden l i v e d h a p p i l y ever
a f t e r . The L a b y r i n t h s t i l l e x i s t s , of course, but
the monster was f i n a l l y bricked up; although i t
is s a i d that i f you place your ear to one particu-
lar wall you oan even now hear a d u l l metalli*
vole* reciting an endless string of meaningless
numerals. The theory that this i s merely the
voice of a well-known lecturer i s , of course,
purely malicious.
