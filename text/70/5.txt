"There was a young lady of Gex"
On examining the e n t r i e s f o r t h i s remarkably
s u o o e s s f u l c o m p e t i t i o n , i t r a p i d l y became c l e a r
t h a t a l l a e s t h e t i c c o n s i d e r a t i o n s had to j e t t i s o n e d ,
and the judgement was narrowed t o a search f o r the
most acceptable f i l t h y s t o r y . Of 120 l i m e r i c k s ,
a good h a l f dozen d i d not r e f e r i n some way to Sex,
and none of these was very good. I t i s p l a i n that
our poets are i n s p i r e d only by the most d i s g u s t i n g
s u b j e c t s ; a t r a i t whioh I have l o n g suspected.
Once again H. Berenbaum has produced the most
c o n s i s t e n t l y u n p r i n t a b l e e n t r y , ,the best of which
oonoerns a hexagonal m o d i f i c a t i o n to the anatomy of
a l a d y produced by the author of " E u c l i d on Sex".
No s i n g l e l i m e r i c k stands out as the worst, so
we s e l e o t as j o i n t winners, H. BiiRENBAUM, P.H. LEVIN
and Id, GILB1SRT, a l l of whom submitted s e v e r a l good
specimens. Other e n t r a n t s , i n c l u d i n g some l a d i e s ,
have the s a t i s f a c t i o n of knowing that t h e i r poems
were e x h i b i t e d d u r i n g our\ dance and were s t o l e n by
ardent admirers of the muse.
Report by Watt A. Wordsworth
A s e l e c t i o n f o l l o w s !
There was "a young l a d y ' o f Gex
Who hated a l l s o r t s of i n s e c t s .

There was a young lady of Gex
Whose b r e a s t s were unduly convex.
