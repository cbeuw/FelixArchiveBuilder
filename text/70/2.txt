I.C. D E B A T E
In h i r i n g the main theatre of the I n s t i t u t Francais
for a lunohtime f u n c t i o n , the L i t e r a r y and Debating
Society ran a considerable r i s k of debacle. How-
-ever, the n o t o r i o u s l y f i c k l e common hard turned up
In s u f f i c i e n t numbers to j u s t i f y the experiment and
a s u c c e s s f u l debate followed.
Mr. James Walters, propoeing that " This House
Hefuses to Toe the Party Line ", pointed out some
bad r e s u l t s of party management i n recent years,and
o c c a s i o n a l l y s a i d something relevant to the motion.
Ur.Walters i s a L i b e r a l , and l i k e many others has
stood f o r Parliament; so I t vac i r o n i c a l to hear
him say " the death agony of the Labour P a r t y has
begun."
Ur.Austen Albu, U.P. (Labour), an ex-Guildsmam
turned I.C. Governor, opposed. His l i n e was P r a c t -
i c a l Government. He described the l n s t a b i l t y of
the French system with too many p a r t i e s , and the
• g i f t i n g f l u x of American p o l i t i c s dominated by
mass clamour and the T.V. screen. Neither method
s u i t e d us: " France has gone to the dogs, and U.S.A.
i s powerful enough to d i t h e r s a f e l y . B r i t a i n needs
a two-party system, i n whioh a united opposition
attacks the p o l i c y of a united government i n order
to probe and expose i t s weaknesses. While small
deviations from the " party l i n e " are d e s i r a b l e ,
there should i n general be a united f r o n t .
Ur. UcCormick of Q.U.C., who spoke very w e l l r e -
-oently about the actress and the bishop, seconded
the p r o p o s i t i o n by banging a b i g L i b e r a l drum with
a red h e r r i n g . He succeeded i n tapping a resonant
frequency i n Ur. Ibbetson, who m e r c i f u l l y r e l i e v e d
the monotony by Jumping out of his seat i n expost-
- u l a t o r y p r o t e s t towards the end of the speech,
which seemed Very long. U r . A l l e n of I.C. (cheers)
spoke f o u r t h . He appeared nervous, but h i s d e l i v e r y
was e x h i l a r a t i n g , and although the l e a s t p o l i s h e d ,
he was the most a t t r a c t i v e speaker. He was very b r i e f
his arguements having been used by the e f f i c i e n t
Mr.Albu, and h i s p r i n c i p a l c o n t r i b u t i o n was to sug-
-gest t h a t , as an M.P. i s elected e n t i r e l y because
of h i s l a b e l , then he must act by i t . I t i s f a i r to
say that such a t h i n plank held Mr. A l l e n up only
because he t r i p p e d along I t so l i g h t l y .
An i n t r i g u i n g remark from the f l o o r came from Mr.
Ibbetson, who propounded the L o g i c a l Dilema t h a t ,
since the proposers were a c t i n g together on the mot-
-ion they were i n faot toeing the party l i n e . This
l i n e was not c l e a r to the Proposers.
Mr. Walters then gained some p r e s t i g e by conrect-
-ing Mr. Berenbaum, who quoted G i l b e r t & S u l i i x a n .
Ur. Berenbaun,has the l a s t laugh however, since Mr.
• a l t e r s has since been proved i n c o r r e c t .
Ur Bingham suggested that government could only
be a compromise between E t h i c s and Experience, and
t h i s i d e a , echoed by Ur. Albu I n summing up, may be
considered an accurate expression of the general
sentiment. _ Forty s i x people l o s t t h e i r deposits,
and seventy two found themselves, perhaps to t h e i r
s u r p r i s e , toeing the p a r t y l i n e .
T H E S P I R I T O F C H R I S T M A S
"Thou s h a l t c a l l Hi s name Jesus, f o r He
s h a l l save His. people from t h e i r s i n s . " As
the year draws round to Christmas once more,
may we a3k how many of us have ever troubled
ourselves to search beyond the facade of
Christmas, to f i n d the meaning and purpose
Of t h a t f i r s t Christmas. The b i r t h of a
great prophet? a teacher? a philosopher? a
leader? -- or the incarnate Son of God? T h i s
i s a question which weumay ignore to our
p e r i l , f o r such a momentous question demands
that each of us should seek, as d i d those
wise men of o l d , to f i n d t h a t c h i l d c a l l e d
Jesus, that we may be able to f i n d the answer
to t h a t question.
We may not be able to look, as they d i d ,
upon the newborn i n f a n t , but we oan see f a r
beyond t h a t s t a t i n . 'Te see the l i f e of one
i n whom the Jews could f i n d no f a u l t . We
see him dying, not because he hf.d no other
choice, but because i t was to die that He was
born, to die f o r you. „ ,
Such a one demands an answer. Yes or
"No". A l i f e belonging to Him, or to y o u r s e l f .
He cannot accept "perhaps".
