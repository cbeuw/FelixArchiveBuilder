24 June 1992 Felix 939 Clubs & Societies
new records: six consecutive
triumphs, a records point margin,
and the most successful hospital of
all time by overtaking Guy's record
of thirty win in the competition. The
game itself will be remembered for
two glorious tries involving the
whole team and finished under the
posts by the second row. Later on
in March, Mary's went on to win
the National Medical Schools
Sevens competition for a third
consecutive time. During the
tournament, the team received
raving reviews by all who saw them
in action. However, Cardiff took
Mary's into sudden death extra time
in the final, but they held their nerve
to win 21-18. The IC 1st X V also
had their finest season to date.
Having won the South-East title for
the fifth consecutive time, they beat
Charing Cross and Westminster
Hospital 31-0 to win the Gutteridge
Cup, in a one sided contest.
However, three days later, they
were beaten in the semi-final of the
U A U championship by Durham.
This was the first time an IC rugby
team had ever ventured beyond the
quarter-finals of the U A U - a very
distinguished performance.
The IC women football team, aka
The Dribblers, also had a very
successful season. Having been
depleted of a few players (notably
Captain Permi) they were beaten in
the semi-final of the U L Cup by
Kings College. However, at full
strength, the Dribblers were a
rampant team, over-running all in
their path. In the end, the University
League title rested on the final game
of the season, against K C H . Victory
for either team would ensure them
claiming the championship. With
the defence working overtime, the
Dribblers managed to fight off an
early surge by K C H to take a 2-0
lead at half time. The second half
produced some good skill by both
teams, but the Dribbler increased
their lead and finally ran out
winners 4-1. Together with the
league title, the Dribblers also
secured their title as top boat racers
in London, with a fine display after
the game!
On a little reporting note, the
Dribblers were the only A C C club
to provide regular match reports of
their games throughout the year.
Their attitude was nothing less than
exemplary. Since these pages are
the sports pages of the IC, it would
help if the A C C clubs got their act
together and actually contributed on
a more frequent basis. My job
description does not entail me
chasing up captains in the vain hope
that they may put pen to paper. If
nothing else, the members of these
clubs should expect results and
reports to appear in FELIX. After
all, if a team or person has played
exceptionally well during a game,
I think it is worth a mention in a
magazine which is supposedly
meant to represent them.
The fortunes of the womens team
compared favourably with those of
the six mens teams. The 1st team
remained unbeaten whilst fielding
their strongest team. But as is the
case with a long season, injuries put
paid to any hopes they may have
had of gaining trophies. Of the other
teams, the 4ths managed an
excellent achievement by winning
promotion to Division 3, while the
2nds and 3rds finished fourth and
third in their respective divisions.
winning medals stakes, the womens
running team are the champs by far.
The team, consisting of Edwidge
Patel, Kristina Semple, Kate !?! and
Maria Raimondi, managed to win
no less than fifteen medals in the
U L championships, held at the
Tooting Bee track. Well done girls!
After not fielding a team in the U L
championships for ages, the
swimming club not only entered a
team, but won the tournament team
trophy convincingly. I think they
should enter a team on a more
regular basis!
I would like to thank Simon for

Of other clubs performing well,
the Ten Pin Bowling Team reached
the quarter-finals of the U A U
championship. They also ran a 14
hour sponsored bowl, raising
£821.26 for the Sportsman Aid
Ward at Middlesex Hospital. The
ladies badminton team reached the
U A U semi-finals before being
overwhelmed by Exeter ladies
whereas the men faired less
favourably, being knocked out in
the early rounds of the U A U . In the
British Universities Judo
Championship in Glasgow, IC took
six medals in total. Kev Brooks,
Reg Cook and Hermann Gottschalk
each won silver in the ten-man team
event, whilst Kev also won silver
in the five-man team event.
However, the best performance
came from Reg who won silver
medals in the individual U60 kg
event as well as the combined
British Universities and
Polytechnics competition. In the

FilmSoc and ICSF
Lethal Weapon 3, Batman Returns,
Basic Instinct, Alien 3, The Player
and Wayne's World...some of the
blockbusters showing at Imperial
College Union very soon. The all-
new FilmSoc and ICSF cinema will
be opening its doors straight after
Freshers' Week and these are just
a handful of the films on offer next
term.
Brand new 35mm projection
equipment is to be installed over the
summer for better picture quality
and improved film availability.
Thre is a change of venue; if
everything goes to plan, new
seating is planned for the Union
Concert Hall, and a new, bigger
screen will be fitted. Films will be
shown in Dolby Stereo, hopefully
on a full surround sound system. To
start off with, FilmSoc will present
a hit movie every Thursday evening
and there will be Science Fiction
goodies from ICSF every Tuesday,
with as many films as possible in
70mm cinemascope.
Admission prices have not been
fixed yet but should not exceed £ 2 ,
very reasonable for an evening
showing in London. You can even
get in for free—in return for doing
a bit of projecting, or helping with
publicity. There are some ambitious
plans for the future—multiple
showings, double bills, weekend
all-day marathons...the possibilities
are endless. So, next term, see films
as they were meant to be seen—on
FilmSoc's big screen.

FilmSoc Chairman 92/93.
