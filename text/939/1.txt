Car Park Money Spinner
John Archer. College pro-Rector,
has written to College staff this
week informing them of the new car
park management. The new scheme
is expected to generate £100,000
per annum for the College from
charges on weekend and evening
users. The franchise for the car park
is now in the possession of
IMPACT (Imperial Activities Ltd),
which has a registered office on the
fifth floor of the Sherfield building.
Financial sources have indicated
that this franchising arrangement
means that the College may no
longer be liable for corporation tax
on income generated by the car
park, and may also be able to waive
V A T payments on car park related
expenditure. IMPACT and Axess
Management Ltd, the company who
have the tender for the car park
management, will be accountable to
the newly created post of Car
Parking Manager.
Sports Centre Shutdown
St Mary's students are reported to
be disgruntled with arrangements
made by Carolyne Osner, IC Sports
and Leisure Manager, to replace the
facilities in the South Kensington-
based College Sports Centre. The
Sports Centre is being extensively
renovated and will be closed until
January 1993. Ms Osner was
making arrangements with St
Mary's, the University of London
Union, and sports centres in
Wandsworth, Westminster, and
Kensington and Chelsea so that
disruption during the renovation
period would be kept to a
minimum. She is on record as
expressing regret at the
'unavoidable' closures.
St Mary's students have
expressed surprise at the demands
that Ms Osner placed on their
facilities, and one student said that
'she didn't get most of what she
wanted.' Senior students added that
they felt a duty to help the students
in South Kensington, not the
college. They said that they would
welcome any South Kensington
students coming to Paddington.
'Students coming to Mary's is
always useful.' said Simon
Stockhill, St Mary's Union
President.
The Sports Centre renovation is
being paid for by a £650,000 loan
from the Harlington Trust. The
trust was set up in 1989 to oversee
money raised from the sale of
gravel extracted from the Imperial
College Union (ICU) owned
Harlington playing fields. The
fields were bought by ICU in 1936
using money paid to the Union in
return for the War Memorial
Ground in Wembley, which was
bought by the Union in 1918. The
War Memorial Ground was paid for
by funds raised by the Union after
the First World War.
The War Memorial money was
also used to purchase the boathouse
and property in Putney. The
College Executive committee is
now considering plans to refurbish
the boathouse. The Sports Centre
renovation will provide increased
changing space room, more
showers, a sauna, steam room and
an eight person poolside spa
(Jacuzzi). There will also be a larger
gymnasium and an exercise and
training studio will also be
provided.
Speaking to yesterday's Union
Annual General Meeting, Zoe
Hellinger, ICU President,'defended
her 'about face' on the Harlington
funding of the renovations. On 4th
October. Ms Hellinger said that 'if
the Sports Centre intends to try and
dig into Harlington Trust funds, the
Union will strongly contest it'. By
5th June, she had changed her
position to believing 'an improved
Sports Centre would attract better
students and provide improved
sports facilities'. Speaking to the
meeting, Ms Hellinger said that in
October, she 'didn't know the facts
first time'. Ms Hellinger's decision
on allowing the use of Harlington
money has been attacked privately
by one of her fellow sabbaticals,
who pointed out that the Union is
losing approximately £400,000 in
interest on the loan.
Underground
There is speculation this week that
the College is considering the
construction of an underground car
park behind the Sports Centre. It is
beleived that the owner of the land
under which the car park would be
built has previously applied for
planning permission for this, but
was refused as there was
insufficient access to the ground.
The access to the land is owned by
the College. The College is beleived
to be very interested in buying the
land from its present owner.
