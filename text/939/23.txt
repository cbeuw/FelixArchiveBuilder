The Pimlico Connection, a tutoring
scheme run at Imperial College,
published its 17th Annual Report
last Friday. The report shows a
30% increase in the number of
Imperial College students taking
part in the scheme, which involves
them acting as volunteer tutors in
local primary and secondary
schools. John Hughes, BP Fellow
for Student Tutoring, has expressed
his thanks to the 130 Imperial
students 'who have given up nearly
six thousand hours during the
course of this year to assist local
teachers and pupils'.
The scheme has been widely
hailed by educationalists and the
educational press. Imperial's tutors
have been called 'pioneers in the
appliance of science' by the
Guardian, and 'role model
students' by the Times Educational
Supplement. After an afternoon's
training, students volunteer to go
out on a Wednesday afternoon to
tutor in maths, science or
technology. The tutors work
individually or in small teams under
the direction of the teacher. The
tutors mainly help with practical
work, where an extra set of hands
and a fresh approach proves useful.
The work involves a partnership not
only with the teacher, but also with
the pupils.
Pupils say that the tutors are
'easier to relate to'. 'They were not
like teachers, they were like
friends,' said one. Teachers are also
appreciative of the tutors' work.
Stephanie Pojak, a link teacher at
St Clements and St James Primary
School said, 'Wednesday
afternoons with the students are a
gift. You have an intelligent,
scientifically minded young adult
able to help. The greatest reward is
knowing that the children are
getting immediate and constant
contact and supervision.'
Of the Imperial students, 95% felt
they were getting practice in simple
scientific communication skills;
85% felt their self confidence
increased; and 95% felt that they
were doing something useful with
what they had learned. Only 3%
thought the tutoring scheme greatly
interfered with their college studies.
One tutor said, 'tutoring has given
me some of my happiest moments
at Imperial. The children told me
organised several dinners in
Chinese and Indian restaurants, to
celebrate Christmas and half term
and such like. Tutors from across
London were invited to a free
Carvery Pre-Christmas dinner at the
Cumberland Hotel. The society
organised an Open Day for Pimlico
children in March. Nearly 150
children came to Imperial College,
The Pimlico Connection
and showed me how much they
enjoy us being there. We, as well
as the kids, benefitted from each
other.'
The tutoring is complemented by
social activities, organised by the
Pimlico Connection Student
Society, part of the Social Clubs
Committee (SCC) of Imperial
College Union. The society has

such as climbing Queen's Tower.
The Open Day followed on from
the success of the Annual Christmas
Caper, organised jointly by the
Pimlico Society and the H U B

Imperial's experience of student
tutoring will be one of the schemes
to be discussed at a London
Teachers' Workshop on Student
Tutoring this Thursday. The
workshop, which is jointly
sponsored by BP and Imperial
College, will study the development
of tutoring schemes, with a view to
further expansion. This expansion
is being aided by Community
Service Volunteers (CSV), whose
'Learning Together' programme is
being funded by the City of
London's Lord Mayor's National
Appeal. C S V ' s Education
Manager, John Potter, aims to
develop the scheme in Scotland and
Northern Ireland, and there are
plans to extend tutoring into arts and
languages. At Imperial, John
Hughes hopes that the new
academic year will see yet more
tutors involved with the Pimlico
Connection, when it restarts in
October.
