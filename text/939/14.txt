A Tale of Two Rectors Felix 939 24 June 1992
I'm not funny, I'm not left wing
Farty issues are just my thing.
One by one, the candidates began to emerge, most from
the closet. The college had planned to raise its public
profile, and not as the Robert Maxwell Home for
Financial Recluses. They wanted an endearing
personality and easy public manner. So why is Ben
Elton standing?
I'm up for the Rectorship? Holy Moses!
I'd sooner go down with myxomatosis.
This candidate was a hot runner, especially away from
the end of a shotgun. This would make him ideal for
dealing with the Inland Revenue, but unfortunately we
will never find out how good he would have been on
the job. Simon Westerman got to h i m first. Truly a
rogered rabbit.
Selection procedures are far reaching
I'll like to know what he's been teaching.
The rigor mortis induced by previous methods were
discarded this time. Not that this solved that problem.
The Governing Body, the old academic graveyard,
instituted new challenging procedures. Apart from
abseiling down the tower, candidates had to rename as
many job titles as possible in sixty seconds. Conversing
in fluent American was also a new requirement.
Water, water, everywhere.
Has no-one thought of this for Clare?
The exercise went on long into the day. Some children
came to watch, confusing the procedure with the H U B
Christmas Caper. The Governing Body, that new
collection of Father Christmases, or indeed Scrooges,
considered the children as the more appropriate
candidates. More appropriate, that is, to that who they
chose before.
