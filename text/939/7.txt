24 June 1992 Felix 939 News Review
Working party on Residences.
'Embarrassing' was one response to
this report. 'A load of crap' was
another. Apparently, the draft copy
of the document contained 8 pages
of errors concerning the residence
situation.
Felix ran a lead story on the
apparent disagreements in the
Sherfield building about the cost of
Furse House. Unfortunately, the
only sentence in the entire piece that
did not contain a qualifying word
meant that Prqfessor Geoff New
was dragged to the Managing
Director's Office like an insolent
schoolboy. It is not for us to suggest
that Mr Fraser is an intolerant bully.
What was Professor New's crime?
He had refused to comment on a
rumour contained in the story.
Clearly Professor New is in the
wrong job; if he were a Civil
Servant this behaviour would surely
be rewarded by a Knighthood.
Estates is now on the job, and is
considering a suitable replacement
for Southside. A feasibility study is
now being conducted into the
placing of cardboard boxes on the
Strand. Tenders from Thames or
London Weekend Television are
especially welcome.
Blatant fraud occurred in the
Imperial College Union (ICU)
building in the first term, and not
in the first floor office. Several bank
notes with the words 'forgery' in
large red letters stamped on them
were taken in the Union Bar.
Innocent students were said to be
using them unaware of what they
were. This is not surprising.
Students do not have money for
long enough to remember what it is.
If you do have some, then hide it,
as you will not see it again for some
time.

Christmas came late to Imperial
College. In February, the
Universities Funding Council
(UFC) awarded a 19.7% increase
in the research money the College
receives, this being the largest
amount to any single University. In
May this award was cut to just
14.6% due to funding error by the
U F C . The ever modest Rodney
Eastwood, Director of Planning, so
eloquent in his praise of Imperial in
February, made himself unavailable
for comment to the Times Higher
Educational Supplement when this
news broke. To get round this, the
Higher came to Felix for
information, and in return they
publicised the great Felix jumble
sale, still running at a Felix office
near you.
Ailing research funding was
given another knock when Her
Majesty's government suggested
that charities should be charged up
to 40% extra for work done in
University labs. This increase was
supposedly to cover administration
costs, and it was suggested that it
would lead to more money for
research institutes. The charities
didn't see the increase with such
clarity, and raised trite points such
as 'we are not going to pay more
for the same research'. Indeed, they
suggested that the measure would
lead to 40% being cut from funding
budgets. Developments are
awaited.
The most subtle cost-cutting
move came on 7th November when
all Messenger, Security and Car
Park (MSCP) staff received a letter
from Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, informing them that the
College would no longer be
requiring their services. M r
Marshall told them that their jobs
would be contracted out to private
companies, and that consultations
on 'staffing reductions' would begin
the next morning. Of course, the
staff were not being issued with
redundancy notices. They were just
told that 'a period of 90 days will
elapse from the start of
consultations before the first
dismissals take place'.
The plans for contracting out or
'outsourcing' of MSCP services
were drawn up in a paper submitted
by Val Straw to the College
Management Planning Group
(MPG) on 19 April 1991. This
paper was revised by Gordon
Marshall, and resubmitted to M P G
on 27 September. The anticipated
negotiations with the unions and
notifications of redundancies were
discussed by Caroline Fox, John
Payne and Val Straw on 1st
November. Marshall told the staff
on 7th November.
Those unions affected, the
Manufacturing Science and Finance
Union (MSF) and the National
Union of Public Employees
(NUPE), immediately called strike
action. An unofficial lightning
strike was held on 8th November,
and this was followed by a 24 hour
stoppage on 4th December. College
entrances were picketed, and
Imperial was described by the
Unions as 'quieter than Christmas
Day'. The strike was timed to
coincide with a meeting of the
Governing Body, and the MSCP
dispute was discussed at length by
the Governors Body. The meeting
was attended by only one Imperial
College Union (ICU) sabbatical
officer, Jonathan Griffiths, the
Deputy President. Both Zoe
Hellinger, ICU President, and Steve
Farrant, ICU Hon Sec (Ents),
refused to cross the picket line
outside the Rector's residence.
Sir Eric Ash, the Rector, and Sir
Frank Cooper, the Chairman of the
Governing Body, went outside to
talk to the pickets, and were
presented with a petition. Inside,
Angus Fraser, College Managing
Director, set out what he saw as the
background to the dispute, and said
that trade unions had been supplied
with all the information they had
requested to make an in-house bid.
He added that a union in-house bid
had been rejected by the college
before the meeting of the Governing
Body.
Alan Taylor-Russell, of the
Association of University Teachers
(AUT) said that the M S C P dispute
was 'no ordinary trade dispute', and
that it was 'a culmination of a
number of events which had led to
a rift between senior management
and the rest of the College'. This
had been evident for some time.
Professor Bruce Sayers, the Dean
of City and Guilds, had written to
Mr Fraser in November drawing
his attention to the 'brutality' and
'impertinence of Gordon Marshall',
and deploring 'functionaries who
have nothing but rote learned skills
to offer'. This letter mysteriously
made its way to the front page of
the Guardian. What particularly
incensed Professor Sayers was
Gordon Marshall's opinion that the
newly recruited officers would be
'appropriately trained and loyal to
Imperial College', which was
regarded as an implicit questioning
of the loyalty of 'long serving and
dedicated' staff. 'These factory
floor manoeuvres are wholly
unworthy,' he wrote.
