Student Debt NUS Closed Shop
Over a quarter of students in Great
Britain have taken out a student
loan, according to recent statistics
from the Department of Education
and Science.
More than one hundred and
eighty thousand students have
applied for a total of £69.9 million
worth of credit. Earlier this year
Tony Cullen, who co-ordinates
loans applications at the College,
said demand was 'greater than
expected' and 1,300 IC students
applied for access funds this year.
These funds are available to those
in financial difficulty.
The Department of Education and
Science has revealed that the
numbers of students in Higher
Education has increased by 47%
from 1980 to 1990. In 1990 there
were 318,000 full time students in
Britain, the total number of students
in Higher Education being quoted
as 1.3 million.
Commenting on the figures in a
press release, Nigel Forman,
Higher Education Minister,
emphasised the Government's aim
to put 1 in 3 young people into some
form of Higher Education.
PostGrad Initiative
Imperial College is to participate in
an initiative launched by the
Government, in which post-
graduate research assistants can
gain their higher degrees through a
partnership with an industrial
company. The 'Postgraduate
Training Scheme' has been
established in a collaboration
between the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI), the Office of
Science and Technology, and five
major higher education institutions.
Each of the five partnerships will
take on 20 researchers, 10 in 1992
and 10 in 1993. Universities taking
part in the scheme, including IC,
are assigned to an industrial partner,
which will provide research projects
and a possible bursary for each
student taken on. The scheme will
lead to MSc and PhD qualifications
in industrial disciplines, such as
materials science, information
technology and process
engineering. The Science and
Engineering Research Council has
allocated a £7000 grant per student
per year. The DTI has allocated
funds of £2 million to cover the cost
of the project.
The Higher Education minister,
Nigel Forman, has postponed a
meeting planned for later today with
the executive of the National Union
of Students (NUS). The minister
and the NUS were to discuss the
prospect of introducing voluntary
membership for student union
members. The proposal to remove
funding from student unions and to
end compulsory student
membership of student unions has
been on the educational agenda
since the minister met Conservative
Students early in May.
The matter was discussed in the
Commons last week during a late
night adjournment debate.
Conservative backbench M P ,
Graham Riddick, told the minister
that he had urged the Government
to abolish the 'student union closed
shop' in March 1988, and was
dismayed that this still had not been
done.
Mr Riddick said that it was
'indefensible' for students not to
have choice in membership of
student unions. Welcoming
newspaper reports that the
Government was to make
membership of the NUS voluntary,
he said that the NUS and student
unions were a 'double closed shop.'
He called sabbatical officers 'a
taxpayer funded army of political
activists, predominantly of the left,'
and condemned the policy of many
unions in banning Nestle products.
Mr Forman said that there were
some ways 'in which campus
(individual) unions are a form of
closed shop.' adding that 'there are
differences as well. Campus unions
are not pre-entry closed shops.
Unlike a trade union closed shop,
a campus union exercises no control
over which students may join the
educational institution.' He further
said that the NUS 'differs from a
closed shop arrangement in that
campus unions vote on whether or
not to affiliate.' The most surprising
comment from the minister was 'the
principle of freedom of association
would suggest that students should
have the right to join an
organisation to meet their legitimate
needs.'
Mr Forman's response to the
debate has elated the NUS, with the
executive claiming that the minister
did not accept that the NUS is a
closed shop. They add that the
charter issued last week by the right
wing Adam Smith Institute
conceded the 'right of student
representation.'
Election rules and Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment was made an
Imperial College Union (ICU)
disciplinary offence following
yesterday's ICU Annual General
Meeting (AGM). The policy, which
was drawn up by Zoe Hellinger,
Union President, was passed
without objection. The existing
College policy on sexual
harassment only applies to assaults
by staff on students. Until
yesterday, there was no mechanism
to deal with assaults by students on
students.
The A G M also passed alterations
to the rules governing Sabbatical
Elections. The revised rules were
drawn up by I C U Elections
Committee after consultations with
what Steve Farrant, ICU Returning
Officer, described as 'interested
parties.' The new rules are
considerably looser than those
previously in force, though some
former rules remain in place. Poster
size is still restricted to A l , and
only 'Blu-Tac' may be used to affix
posters to notice boards. Gum
backed material may now be used
for lapel stickers. The removal or
sabotage of posters remains an
offence, and all campaigns must be
conducted within the publicity
budget set by the Elections
Committee.
A new emphasis has been placed
on the reporting of elections by
Union media, and College and
Constituent College Union media
will fall under election rules for the
first time. Union media must
remain freely available to all
candidates, and candidates must be
informed in writing of Union media
interviews or discussions three days
before deadline or transmission.
Several appointments were made
to Union posts. Simon Govier and
James Grinter were ratified as Felix
Business Managers, and David
Goddard was elected Haldane
Record Buyer after promising to
buy 'more Kylie.' Marc Ellis was
returned as, one of the ordinary
members of House Committee. The
second ordinary member was
opened to nominations from the
floor, and Gina Mortley was elected
over Jonathon Griffiths. The posts
of Postgraduate Affairs officer,
Haldane Book Buyer and Transport
Officer will be filled in the next
academic year.
Business and financial affairs
were detailed by the Deputy
President, Jonathan Griffiths. His
year saw the early payoff of the
Bookstore loan and a reduction in
the operating losses of the Snack
Bar. M r Griffith's report did not
refer to plans for the refurbishment
of the Union lounge bar and snack
bar, which will take place over the
summer. These plans were
discussed by Union House
Committee and Union Bar and
Catering Committee. Detailed
tenders from four companies are
now being discussed by a seven
person working party, with a
member of College administrative
staff on the working party. The
College has been informed of the
plans, which are being considered
by Angus Fraser, Managing
Director, and Gordon Marshall,
Director of Estates. Both men are
expected to approve the plans
before the end of the week.
Mr Griffith's was criticised for
not informing an earlier general
meeting of his change of telephone
number. Next year's Union
President and Felix editor informed
the meeting that they would be
living out of Halls of Residences
next year. Chris Davidson and
Jonty Beavan asked the A G M to
approve the payment of their
expected hall bills towards the cost
of their outside accommodation.
After both stating that phone
numbers and addresses of their
outside residences would be made
public knowledge, their request was
allowed by the meeting.
Mr Griffiths' final comment was
student unions did not need
sabbaticals, and that they should be
run by professional Managers. He
did add that if he was asked to be
a Sabbatical again, he would
probably do it.
Reports were also presented by
Steve Farrant, Honorary Secretary
(Events); Gina Mortley, Union
House Committee Chairman; and
Steve Newhouse, Social Clubs and
Committees Chairman. These
reports were ratified. The award of
Union Social Colours was also
ratified. The conferring of Union
General Awards will be confirmed
at Thursday's I C U Council
meeting. Joe Fernley, A G M Chair,
said that all students cou'ld attend the
Council meeting at 2.00pm.
Thursday 25th June in the Union
Dining Hall.
