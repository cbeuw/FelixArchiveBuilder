A Tale of Two Rectors Felix 939 24 June 1992
16 / think your choice of Rector should be
Someone who has woodwork CSE.
Both Todd and Flannelli shook slightly when this elder
statesman appeared to pass judgement. For this man to
impart words of wisdom took no time whatsoever, but
several mugs of tea. H e is apparently barred from the
Felix office because of this, despite his musical talent.
Well, at least Arthur listens to him.

Head of Security, an instant hit
they chose him by a video fit.
John Poindexter was indeed an ideal choice for head of
security. His experience includes gate watching, paper
shredding, bananas; he was also chosen for his ability to
organise Semtex and Tupperware parties. His middle
name, not to say his bank balance, is Kalaschnikow.

It's those friendly girls from HUB
What do they do ? Now there's the rub.
The qualities and indeed texture of the applicants'
spouse are to be actively considered. The last spouse
bequeathed the H U B office to the college by poisoned
chalice. The poison probably came from some
amphibious creature, such as a toad. It' serves to
coordinate the air flow, and recycle the hot air. It is
currently involved in an accounting exercise. A rather
creative exercise.

She laughed, I'm Conferences, I'm impartial,
Check it up with Gordon Marshall.
Oliver North knew the ins and outs of halls, especially
Fawn Hall, his former secretary. H e was the model
appointment to the Conference Office, affairs being all
the rage. According to his wife, who is also his best
friend, he is a bit of an action man. This should help
immeasurably with the maintenance. A stickler for
Iranian roulette, he easily sheds waite from his
shoulders.
