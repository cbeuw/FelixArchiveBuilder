News Review Felix 939 24 June 1992
With the consultations due to run
out in a matter of days, the
Governing Body instructed that the
consultation period be extended 'by
no more than a month in order to
facilitate an acceptable resolution'
of the dispute. To further facilitate
a settlement, the Governors decided
that the Messenger and Security
dispute should be resolved first, and
that the future of the Car Park
would be decided at a later stage.
An agreement in principle was
reached, between management and
unions, and protracted negotiations
were concluded in February, with
the Rector announcing a
compromise, and the unions
claiming to have won the argument.
The results of the new security
system are clearly visible, with new
Prime Ministerial costumes, and
plastic identity cards.
Whither the car park? The unions
became restless in April and May,
Never has so
much been
written about so
little
but the College was keeping mum.
They certainly weren't revealing
that the future of the car park had
effectively been decided on 11 July
1991, that tenders were being
accepted around the time of the
M P G meeting on 9 April 1992, and
that by the M P G meeting on 14
May, a tender from Axess
Management Ltd had been
accepted. The story of the
concealed tender only became
public when Felix broke the story
on 5 June. Again this happened
without consultation with any of the
unions, but it apparently has the
Rector's tacit approval, so expect
changes soon.
The entire story behind the
proposals is enmeshed in layers of
contradiction, subterfuge and
ignorance. John Payne was
involved in the 1st November
discussion which drew up the
'redundancy' announcements. John
Payne wrote to Mick Saul of NUPE
on 14 June, with the phrase 'it is not
Management's intention to fill
vacancies with Contract staff.
Steve Newbold, the College
Marketing Director, said that the
letter issued to staff detailing the
consultation timetable was not a
redundancy notice, despite Gordon
Marshall saying that 'a period of 90
days will elapse from the start of
consultations before the first
dismissals take place'. Staff were
told that the car park was to be sold
off on the recommendation of a
consultant's report, even though the
report never being openly
circulated. All that was published
was Val Straw's interpretation of
the report, which may have been
coloured by her job description.
More sinister is the fact that the
brief or instructions given to the
with his arrest, and was described
by another student newspaper as a
'militant atheist'. His latest project
is to condemn the Education
Secretary, John Patten, to eternal
damnation.
In Imperial College Union,
disagreement was just starting to
boil over when Dan Shields, Social
Cultural and Amusements Board
(SCAB) Treasurer, discovered he
could be financially liable for any
losses made by societies under his
control. After several heated
exchanges, Mr Jonathan Griffiths,
ICU Deputy President, said, T was
about to hit the little shit'. The
matter was later resolved amicably.
The position of Honorary
a review that was critical of a
Dramatical Society - Operatic
Society co-production of Grease,
she helped remove 3500. copies of
Felix. She was then one of a group
which replaced it after the show had
finished its run (See letters page).
Although Ms Hellinger later
apologised for her actions, she did
manage her first appearance in
national media, when The
Independent covered the story in its
Diary column.
The disappearance of Felix
triggered a number of events:
Richard Eyers, Publications Board
Chairman, resigned in protest. His
successor, David Henderson-Begg,
also resigned later in the year,
consultants remain classified. After
all, they could have been told to
recommend the sale of the car park,
and ignore any evidence to the
contrary.
The full story may never be
known, as freedom of speech was
one of the first casualties of the
security dispute. Bruce Sayers and
other academics were criticised by
the Rector for speaking out, and at
one stage the Rector imposed a
'discipline of silence' on
management and unions. Freedom
of speech was also attacked in the
other example of the role of the
censor this year. A former IC
student Michael Newman was
arrested for trying to sell a
blasphemous video to a member of
the Police force. Mr Newman told
Felix that he was extremely satisfied
Secretary (Events) has been held by
many esteemed and reasonable
people. But M r Steve Farrant, this
year's holder, has brought more
publicity to the post than any other
occupant. M r Farrant managed to
get a warning from the Police after
walking naked, tied to another man,
between Harrods and Imperial
College during the Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump for Rag. An
innocent piano became the object of
Mr Farrant's affections in the spring
term. While relaxing in the Union
Building M r Farrant made a
throwaway comment about the state
of the piano which resulted in an,
as yet, unidentified group of people
destroying the instrument.
But Mr Farrant's excesses were
outdone a week later by his fellow
Sabbatical Zoe' Hellinger. Upset by
quoting 'immature behaviour' in the
Union Office as the source of his
frustrations. The only candidate to
fill this gap is Hugh Eland; M r
Eland did not care to comment on
when he would resign if elected to
the post.
The other Grease-related event
was the Trappist Monk syndrome,
to wit, the mysterious silence of the
notorious Gavin Pearson during the
theft of Felix. M r Pearson arrived
in the Felix Office after the theft,
stating he had been threatened by
Tim Proctor, President Of City and
Guilds Constituent College Union.
Later that week he denied all
knowledge of the allegations. M r
Proctor, whose constituent college
union (CCU), along with the Royal
School of Mines Union had
financially underwritten part of the
