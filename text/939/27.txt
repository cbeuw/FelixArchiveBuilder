'NOOOOOOOWWWW!!'
Stress's body signalled it had
completed the change. He reached
forward, grabbed the club, leaned
to the side and swung the apeman
around him through the air. Totally
lost for grunts the tribal leader arced
around, lost his hold on the club and
sailed straight into the far wall.
Thirteen skulls cracked, one with a
squishy sound.
Stress lifted the club high to a
wave roar from the crowd and
started to move forward. Unable to
move his right leg he looked down
to see a neanderthal wrapped
around it trying to gnaw through the
armoured leggings. Uttering a
crazed laugh Stress threw himself
forward on to his hands and flipped
himself into a forward somersault
sending the very disorientated
apeman through the air and into the
second row of the audience.
Unfortunately he landed among the
werewolf supporters who began
barbecuing him for the victory
celebrations.
'An incredible move there by the
half-back leaves himself room to
manoevre though I don't see much
support for him breaking through
the neaderthal pack. Bloodfang
looks cooked and the rest of the
team, lacking a leader or at least
someone who could think, have
resorted to fights to the death with
anyone who comes near.'
The commentator paused to let
the admiring screams of the crowd
fill the mike.
'The half-back's off and running!
He might be ragged but he sure can
move! He's heading for the goal
line leaving a wake of destruction
behind him. The neanderthals have
set up a last ditch defence. They've
dug it about four feet deep. Lined
it with spikes and are standing
before it with weapons they've
smuggled on to the pitch.'
. Seeing the obstacle ahead Stress
gathered pace and running at top
speed dived into a series of
somersaults, pulling out and up as
he hit the ground before the
defending neanderthals. Spinning
through the air he planted his flying
hands on the neanderthals heads and
pushed into a final dive, landing
him on the touchline beyond the
barricade.
The crowds' screams of applause
turned into a shocked silence as
Stress pulled off the wolf mask and
began walking towards the pedestal.
The silence around him was soon
filled with howls of anger and
hatred as the crowds, unable to get
beyond the fences around the pitch,
spat and shouted at the pale invader.
As Stress climbed the first of the
steps a commotion behind him
made him turn. One of the
neanderthals had clambered through
the barricade and was charging at
him, spear in hand. Stress fired
point blank, sending the caveman
stumbling back. The neanderthal
paused, looked at himself and cried
out.
'What have I done to myself?!'
Stress climbed two more steps.
'PREPARE T O M E E T Y O U R
F A T E , W O R M ! ! '
Stress looked up to see the
superheroes Dark Destroyer and
Regenerator circling overhead like
overdressed vultures. As the Dark
Destroyer swooped down, mains
power punching the ground around
him Stress aimed and fired. The
Punisher of the evil ones fell
towards the ground in a smoking
spiral of indecision and began
collecting information for an
accurate and careful judgement of
the wrong-doer. A similar attempt
by Regenerator left him canvassing
opinion for a collective discussion
on the correct rehabilitation needed.
Stress climbed some more steps.
'DIE Y O U TRAITOR!'
Stress ducked as Carefree fired
the futility gun, it fizzled over his
head and struck the neanderthals
climbing through the gap in the
barricade. They dropped down in
a circle and began wheedling little
wooden totems while discussing
firemaking. Stress fired back,
leaving her to collapse in a heap and
begin crying.
He climbed the final steps and
was approaching the dias when
smoke billowing up from his hand
made him look down. The truth in
his hand was glowing red, spouting
black and white smoke as it
overheated from excessive use. As
Stress started at it in indecision it
exploded.
Picking himself up from the floor
he brushed the smoke away and
staggered the final feet'to where the
symbol of the inner system,
mounted at the centre of the grand
pedestal, needed only a twist to set
the changes rolling. As Stress
grasped the statue the contents of
the truth's gun explosions had their
effects. Stress felt all his single
mindedness, all his anger filled
drive evaporated and the weight of
perception settled on him.
'NO!'
Seeing clearly the pain that he
would cause, how could he do this?
To tear away the coccoon around
these people. He could now feel the
pain that they would go through, he
could now empathise. He curled up
before the dias, head in his hands.
Lying there he heard the silence
around him fall, the weak range
effect of the blast stilling the anger
of the audience. In this quiet the dim
sound of a marching band could be
heard, slowly rising. Stress lifted
his head up to the far end of the
stadium where, flying majestically
out of the high exit, the pursuit cop
appeared.
On silver wings it swooped down
across the pitch and landed before
the statue. To the background of
pipes and drums the robot turned to
the audience and spoke.
' W H E N I ' M R H Y M I N G I

NO GAIN!!'
And then he twisted the statue.
T H E END.
