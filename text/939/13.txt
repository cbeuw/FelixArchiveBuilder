24 June 1992 Felix 939 A Tale of Two Rectors
Before, they chose Sir Eric Ash
To come and run this heap of trash
As there had been change in recent times, and still more
short changing, our lords and mistresses decided to
widen the duties. In future, all Rectors will have to do
work experience with Kensington Council (director of
homosexual studies, Bryan Levitt). This will give them a
greater appreciation for what passes as decision making.
Come in, I'm friendly, nice and keen.
I won't put a spanner in the machine.
In most organisations, the job would pass to the number
two. The reason w h y it didn't happen here is shown in
the photograph. Enough said.
This time they thought they'd get it right,
By promising it three times a night.
Of course, as Angus Fraser found, all top flight recruits
are recruited by an outside agency, completely ignoring
the internal personnel sector. The calibre of the recruit is
proportional to the fee levied. Prime examples of the
rigidly run advertising campaign could be seen around
London.
And on his behalf, his latest appliance,
A campaign to run like Ashdown's alliance.
Not that he would give up without a fight. Following
the lurid standards shown in sabbatical elections, and
indeed afterwards, he decided to use the
Stapleton/Beavan approach, and flaunt not himself but a
seemingly brainless bimbo. A free lash to anyone who
spots the difference?
