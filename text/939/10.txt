News Review Felix 939 24 June 1992
Another contest was announced
during the sabbatical elections.
Time is running out for Sir Eric
Ash, who will step down as Rector
in the next twelve months. The egg-
and-spoon race to succeed him is
now drawing to a close. The
decision will be made by a sub-
committee of the Governing Body,
with the result due on the 26th June.
The committee normally contains
all Deans of the constituent colleges
of Imperial. Interesting to note that
one PR man and notorious self-
publicist has asked not to be
included on the panel. Whatever
reason could be given for refusing
such an influential position?
Professor Peter Richards has
been making a name for himself
recently, with a controversial
statement on how Junior Doctors
should be treated, and a rejection
from the Junior Doctors'
Committee of the British Medical
Association (BMA). Professor
Richards is also launching a survey
to coincide with the Patients'
Britain had
become
Europe's only
one party state
Charter, and a proposal to save
Charing Cross Medical School, if
not the entirety of London
University, by merging it with
Imperial College. He also has a
formidable reputation for his crime-
beating rugby tackle.
One merger that will definitely
take place this summer is the joining
of the Science Museum Library
with the Imperial College Central
libraries. The joint building should
only be closed for a few days over
the long vacation, but because of the
nature of the necessary excavation,
the Haldane Library will not be
moved to the ground floor until
during the Christmas vacation.
1992 was also the year of the long
awaited General Election, which
successfully avoided student issues
altogether, by holding the election
during the vacation. This played
absolute havoc with the National
Union of Students (NUS) Target
70' campaign, an ill disguised scam
for the election of Labour
candidates. April 9th brought IC
Radio's most ambitious venture:
live results and analysis, music, and
coverage of reaction in live reports
from all the major party
headquarters, and the local count.
Although the programme was a
runaway success the result did not
please the producer of the Election
extravaganza, who claimed that
Britain had become Europe's only
one party state.
Student issues, though wilfully
neglected in the General Election,
have made a strong showing in the
news output of Felix and IC Radio.
Archer. Professor Archer is the
pro-Rector responsible for
industrial contacts, and in an earlier
life was the scientific advisor to the
committee.
After lunch with the Governing'
Body, the committee granted an
audience to an ICU delegation. The
committee members were presented
with a 'financial hardship' poll
representing about 5 % of Imperial
College students, and Zoe Hellinger
made clear that the committee 'had
come to the wrong college'. The
report from the committee was due
In January, the House of Commons
Select Committee into Education,
Science, and Arts came on tour to
Imperial, to help them draw up their
report into levels of student
hardship. This was their idea of
meeting the students of the country,
and assessing the situation on the
ground. Surely not? After all.
Imperial was the only higher
education establishment that the
committee visited, though it is just
up the road from Westminster, and
the committee does have excellent
contacts with Professor John
to be published in April, but the
election disturbed things a bit. This
has caused a ripple of protest, with
Lorna Fitzsimons, NUS President-
elect, calling for its immediate
publication, to avoid another
'summer of discontent'.
The other strong student story
was the idea of a students' charter.
The idea was first leaked last
February by the Cabinet Office to
David Henke, The Guardian's
Westminster Correspondent. The
story has caused more than a little
interest in / C N N , and never has so
much been written about so little so
frequently. Hypothetical conjecture
is ail very well, but a major part of
the scheme could be voluntary
membership to college Student
Unions. Indeed, the matter has shot
up the political agenda, being the
subject of an adjournment debate in
the Commons, and featuring in
Prime Minister's Questions last
week.
What does voluntary membership
mean? Effectively, the money from
college that pays for student unions
will instead go to students directly,
and they will then be billed for
affiliation to the union should they
so wish. The catch? Given the
choice between roughly one
hundred quid or the odd bar
extension, which would you
choose? This has raised the blood
pressure of many ICU Officers, so
expect some campaigns next year to
promote 'how wonderful your
Union really is'. This will make the
student feel that it really should
invest in a Students' Union.
'Students may
think they're
poor'
Crime has been on the increase
all year at Imperial. As one well-
placed Security source put it,
'Students may think they're poor,
but every thug from Paddington to
Brixton knows that mummy and
daddy gave you a stereo as a going
away present'. The amount of
crime, both reported and
unreported, in the College is huge.
The Dramatic Society lost £10,000
worth of equipment in the first week
of the first term. A n
ex-student got
security men to help him load a van
with computer equipment. £950 in
cash was stolen from a room in a
Hall of Residence. These are just
the major thefts this year. There are
many others. To try and reduce
these.losses, security was revamped
(above), and a swipe card system
was introduced to the College over
Easter. It required all students to
carry an identity card with them at
all times. After initial problems, the
system is now reported to be
working smoothly. Like chocolate
peanut butter.
