24 June 1992 Felix 939 News Review
In tandem with Security cards,
ICU has introduced ICU Card
checks on most Wednesday and
Friday nights to try and reduce
crime and preserve its licence. One
place that might not retain a licence
is Southside Bar. Residents have
taken up games of target practice,
aiming beer glasses at passing
police cars. No one has been hurt
so far, but expect serious
investigations in the near future.
The fuzz, as Queen Victoria said,
were not amused.
Some crimes cannot be stopped
by security cards. After a long
surveillance operation, Wing Chun
instructor Master Sid Sofos was
caught by Police exposing himself
to members of Alexander Hall on
Kensington Gore. Bernard Sunley
House was the scene of a major
undercover drugs operation. One
member of staff was involved along
with several students, all of whom
were gently asked to leave College.
Not leaving the College is Richard
Macrory, recently promoted to
Professor of Environmental Law at
the Centre for Environmental Law
in Prince's Gardens, and appointed
a member of the Royal Commission
on Environmental Pollution.
Professor Macrory was once a
lawyer for Friends of the Earth, and
his chair is being sponsored by
Denton Hall Burgin & Warren, the
law firm employed by Friends of
the Earth during the public enquiry
into the building of a reprocessing
plant at Sellafield. Carolyne Osner
was appointed as Sports and Leisure
Manager, after a career as acting
Head of Recreation at the Royal
Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea.
Dr John Hardy, formerly of St
Mary's, was awarded the IPSEN
Prize for Research into Alzheimers
Disease in November 1991. By
January 1992, Dr Hardy and four
other members of his team had left
for the United States, in search of
better pay, conditions and job
security. In April, the last senior
members of the old team left in the
shape of Dr Alison Goethe and her
husband. Professor Peter Richards,
Dean of St Mary's, now hopes to
build a new team to continue the
trailblazing research of Dr Hardy's
team, or to expand out into new
areas.
Professor Tim Shaw, Chairman
of the Academic Staff Assembly,
was re-elected to the post of Dean
of the Royal School of Mines for a
further three years. Professor David
Phillips was appointed Head of
Chemistry, in succession to
Professor Steven Ley, who was
head hunted by Cambridge.
Professor Mike Mingos, who
arrived as the Sir Edward Franklin
BP Chair of Inorganic Chemistry
just before Christmas, was elected
a Fellow of the Royal Society in
April. Professor Bruce Sayers, that
wonderful letter writer, was re-
appointed to the Global Advisory
Committee on Health Research of
the World Health Organisation.
Professor Sayers is Dean of City
and Guilds College.
What changes will be seen in
1992/3? The Rector leaves us in
July 1993; Gordon Marshall is
expected to leave not long after, and
possibly before. It's all change in
the ICU office, with new faces, new
ideas and even a new approach
promised. As for the current
sabbaticals, Zoe' goes off to start
research into AIDS, with Biology's
Professor Roy Anderson becoming
more publicly identified with
treatment of the disease. Other
medical developments will come in
the shape of the much deferred
Tomlinson report. Sir Bernard
Tomlinson is currently looking at
the rationalisation of London health
care. The only questions being
asked are which hospitals will he
close and which teaching hospital
will go.
Furse House will probably be
bought, causing glimmers in the
eyes of receivers and liquidators
everywhere. The poll tax will
finally die in 1993, sometime,
allowing the re-enfranchisement of
doing a day's work (with BT?), and
Jonathan and Steve become students
again. Adam is expected to do a bit
of travelling, around Poland,
Czechoslovakia and such like.
Anything to escape the retribution
he expects. He will be sorely missed
by Whiskers, the new Felix mouse,
which will probably die next year
anyway. When he does, we're
buying a cat.
The possibility of a staff protocol
looms ominously, as does the threat
of voluntary membership. Reform
of college unions looks like causing
further major reforms in the
National Union of Students. They
are seriously considering an opt out
clause for students of affiliated
colleges.
Research into Alzheimers
continues under the direction of the
new, post-Hardy team, as does
the disenfranchised. Tube fares will
probably go up. Alan Bailey
threatens to come back to do a PhD.
The Management School will
probably continue to give away
scholarships to the chosen few. FBI
becomes the Finance Society. Our
very own one parent family, the
duck, will return to Beit Quad and
produce yet another brood.
Finally, in October, the new
fellows and associates of the college
will be inaugurated. Step forward,
Sir Roger Bannister, Professor Sir
John Cadogan, Doctor Anthony
King, John Smith (not the next
Labour leader, but the former
College Secretary), and Robert
Wilkins. The inauguration will be
in the Royal Albert Hall on
Commemoration Day, and they will
be beside those lucky graduates.
