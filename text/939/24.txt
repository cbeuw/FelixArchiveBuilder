Feature Felix 939 24 June 1992
This year has seen the
development of one of IC Union's
mSCs (minor subcommittees) to
heights previously undreamed of.
The subject in question being Rag,
Imperial's excuse for doing loads of
silly things in the name of charity.
To celebrate our rise to fame, here
is a look back, in words and
pictures, over the last year.
Bug-A-Ewe '92 kicked off in
style with the infamous
Tiddly winking down Oxford
refers to a pile of cannonballs—
humm), eighty of IC's bravest
lunatics leapfrogged over Camden
Lock, danced on bus shelters
outside B B C T V Centre and
searched frantically for pieces of
ladies underwear outside the "Cutty
Sark. Not a day to be forgotten in
a hurry!
Three weeks into term and with
the fun only just beginning, Rag had
already raised a staggering
£ 1 2 , 5 0 0 . And that was
Rag's Rise to Fame
Tamsin
Braisher,
ragette
extraordinaire,
reviews the past
year's
behaviour. Such
a waste of an
education...
Street—tough on the hands and
knees, not to mention the poor
shoppers. Consolation for the 220
still enthusiastic students involved
came in the form of the even more
infamous Drink-A-Pub-Dry, a
small, sober pat-on-the-back for
those that helped raise over £2,800
for Action aid in just one morning.
Tiddlywinking and tiddlydrinking
were closely followed by Rag's
second event of the year, the hugely
successful Live Monopoly, which
incorporated a crazy 18-hour, non-
stop, overnight collection. Fancy
dress was the order of the day with
outfits ranging from plain silly to
the downright absurd—and moods
to match.
Having rampaged through
London collecting bits of Old Kent
Road and desperately trying to
avoid the roving jail van, the
surviving, and as yet undaunted,
collectors passed on to the next
event—The Great Sightseeing
Challenge. In weather that would
have frozen the balls off a brass
monkey (I'm told that actually
before...wait for it....da da da
dum...Rag Week.
A whole nine days of sheer
stupidity and total disruption that
many people still recall with
horror.. .What but Rag can explain
why 38 otherwise normal, sane (in
most cases anyway) students stood
up in their underwear in front of a
television camera and huge
slavering audience to auction off 24
hours of their time;
Why else would two people stroll
naked and 3-legged through
Knightsbridge on a busy Saturday
morning in November getting
stopped by the police on the way,
if not for the Sponsored Nude
Kamikaze Parachute Jump? (OK,
OK, so they were actually wearing
bow ties around their necks.)
And as for the RCS Beer
Festival—what more an excuse do
1,200 people need to spend 11
hours celebrating the ancient art of
drinking than that of raising over
£3,000 for charity at the same time?
The second term began with a
bang...or a stabbing...or the
inventive use of a blunt piece of
piping and a piece of candlewax
(?!), as an atmosphere of murder,
mystery and suspense pervaded
College in the run-up to the second
outsize boardgame of the year,
Cluedo.
Accusations and hypotheses filled
the air as teams tried to discover
who killed Penguin, by visiting the
board locations and bribing the
marshalls to tell them the identity
of the murderer. Many people were
none the wiser when the dirty deed
turned out to have been done by
Mrs Peacock, a sabbatical at Keele
University, but this did not detract
from the general fun and frolics at
the massive party afterwards.
Shock, horror, oh my God! No
one quite realised how far Rag was
(still is) prepared to go in the name
of charity...jumping off a 180 foot
crane with only a piece of elastic
attached and actually enjoying it?
But then, the experience has been
compared favourably to sex, and at
four seconds is reputed to last
longer! No comment, but if there's
enough public demand, Rag could
be persuaded to try it again...!
May 16th saw the long-awaited
Rag Fete, complete with coconut
shy, balloon race and the major
attraction, Gunge Wrestling. Slimy,
slippery and indisputably green—
what better to cover yourself with
on a sunny Saturday afternoon?
With the opportunity to throw
nasty, cold, wet sponges at the
Union sabs, and the return of the
Hit Squad and their speciality flans,
those people that turned up had a
much better and messier time than
those that stayed and revised in their
rooms.
One of the attractions of Rag
events is the chance to do not only
things that are not normally morally
expected, but also to go to things
you couldn't normally afford. For
instance, a group of dedicated
collectors turned up to six nights of
Sinatra concerts at the Royal Albert
Hall. Not only did everyone amass
loads of dosh for Leukaemia
Research, but they also got the
chance to see Cleo Lane and
Johnnie Dankworth (naff jazz
singer and better saxophonist), not
to mention the great, the amazing
'Frankie Boy' himself singing My
Way and New York New York.
Just goes to show that collecting has
its perks.
Well, so much for the quick run-
down to this year's events.
Hopefully those of you that were
'Mad, Silly and Part of It' have had
a laugh remembering some of the
stupid things you got involved in,
and those that didn't now have more
idea of what to expect next year.
Last year Rag was discreet, but next
year we're gonna be unavoidable.
