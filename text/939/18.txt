Opinion Felix 939 24 June 1992
Viqar Ahmad
and Declan
Curry were at
the University of
London Union
General Council
at which the
issue of racism
was brought up
Despite heroic efforts, Imperial
College Union (ICU) meetings have
a bit of a reputation for bureaucracy
and officiousness. Yet all this is
forgiven, as it pales into
insignificance when compared with
the antics at the University of
London Union (ULU) General
Union Council (GUC). G U C
meetings are horrific, and I am told
they always have been. At one
there were U L U card checkers
when we tried to register, but none
u few minutes later. Curious.
Was the chairman of this meeting
really as irritating as I remember?
He pleaded for easy treatment,.
excusing himself by saying that it
was his first meeting. Unfortunately
it won't be his last, as he will be
next year's G U C chairman as well.
Minutes and announcements were
procedural motion to move past the
elections and reports to the first
motion. This was an anti-Fascism
motion, heavily amended by the
Union of Jewish Students (UJS).
This procedural motion was
defeated. There were then
nominations for three posts of G U C
representative to the U L U
management committee. Smita
Biswas from the London School of
A Question of Race
Fun and games at a completely unconnected Union meeting.
dispensed with, and on to the
elections we went. Not quite. First
a frustratingly futile discussion on
who should be allowed into the
meeting to observe. Given that this
is the General Union Council of the
University of London Union, one
may have assumed that any student
in the University of London would
be allowed to watch what was being
stage, we were discussing whether
to vote on allowing a vote on an
amendment to an amendment to the
motion. I kid you not.
This advanced form of torture
was convened to elect a fistful of
officers, hear four reports and
debate seven ordinary motions. Fat
chance. Three and a half hours later
we had got as far as debating, but
not voting on, the first motion.
Well, not exactly on the motion per
se, but eight times on the
amendments to it.
The meeting began innocently
enough with opening remarks from
the U L U President. She should
have saved her breath - most
delegates we're massing towards the
bur or coffee machine in
preparation for the long night
ahead. A swift perousal of the
minutes showed that IC had skipped
the last meeting. Such a vast
number of IC delegates mobbed the
entrance - four in all - that there was
a danger of us being turned away
from this meeting. Apparently I was
Angie Creissen and rather strangely
perpetrated in his or her name. One
is naive. A list of all the observers
demanding death by boredom was
read out. No names were
immediately recognisable, though
our very own Louise van der
Straeten, the IC Union Finance
Officer, turned up later. The
Chairman then barred the observers
from entry, a decision which was
challenged from the floor. The
Chairman refused to accept the
challenge because the c\.Hllenger
couldn't quote chapter and verse
from the constitution. Copy of
constitution passed round.
Chairman rechallenged. Observers
allowed in at last. Roll on voluntary
membership.
Immediately there was a
Economics, David Lee Peller of
King's College, and Mark Richer
of the Royal Veterinary College
were elected unopposed. Smita
Biswas was also elected unopposed
as G U C representative to the
Committee on Student Activities
and Management. Mark Richer
defeated Re-Open Nominations for
the post of Access Officer. Nazmin
Hussain was defeated by Re-Open
Nominations for the post of
Postgraduate Officer. Richer was
the only candidate to circulate a
manifesto before the meeting, and
the only candidate to speak.
After the elections came a repeat
of the procedural motion to move
straight on to the anti-fascism
motion. This caused considerable
annoyance and it was defeated even
more heavily than before. Oh, the
futility of it all. Had the meeting
continued without these
interruptions the anti-fascism
motion may well have been reached
by this point.
The report from the U L U
President concentrated on proposed
cuts at the School of Oriental and
