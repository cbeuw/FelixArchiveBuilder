Clubs & Societies Felix 939 24 June 1992
Well, with two days to go before the
end of term, now seems a good a
time as any to reflect upon the
happenings of the year pertaining to
the clubs and societies pages of
FELIX.
The year started with a bang as
usual with the Freshers' Fair. This
is the annual event in which naive
new students came along in their
masses, wondering what the hell
college life was all about. However,
they only found slightly older and
wiser students ready to take their

Ben. which is a darn sight more
than what other people mustered
during the rest of the time.
Throughout the year, Film Soc
and ICSF provided us with regular
bits of news concerning their latest
showings. So a round of applause
to them for being so well organised,
and for fully utilising the advertising
power of FELIX for their members.
However, these plaudits are not
meant for Alex McLintock, who in
rather mitigating circumstances,

hard earned money (in the name of
memberships) in exchange for
promises of activities and events as
suitable alternatives to the
monotony of lectures and practicals.
On reflection, it may be said that
some of these promises may have
been fulfilled, but it is a sad fact that
very few clubs actually met the high
expectations placed in the minds of
members whilst enlisting. I bet
many of you are still wondering
why the hell you joined a particular
society, especially one that hasn't
even bothered to contact you
throughout the year. Well now
you're all a bit wiser and will know
better next year.
Once the hustle and bustle of the
first week died away, clubs started
to use FELIX as a medium in which
to lure more unsuspecting students
into their grasp. A good example of
this was a series of articles by Ben
Quant on behalf of ICU Christian
Outreach. . These were by all
accounts very long and well
reasoned arguments, but to the
majority of us they were, and lets
be frank about this, rather pointless.
was appointed Typographical Error
Editor by Adam (we've made up
now - Ed). Since he failed
miserably in fulfilling this post, the
editor is still accepting applications
for this vacancy. So if anyone is
interested, please come into the
FELIX office for an application
form.
As the novelty of being at IC
wore off. November saw the first
photos of one of the IC's clubs in
action. Yes, our intrepid FELIX
photographer had taken on mission
impossible, and travelled with the
RCS Mens 1st X V rugby team to
Chiswick. (Not bad, since I had sent
him to Harlington!). The team,
somewhat chuffed at having its
picture taken, produced a
performance which was sufficient
to beat Goldsmith College 7-6, and
for them to appear on the front page
of issue 915.
With this apparent willingness of
FELIX to provide a photographer,
other clubs decided to get in on the
act. And thus the Hockey Club, the
Mens Basketball team and even the
Dribblers wanted to have their
photos taken. What will all this
vanity come to!
Together with this increased
awareness amongst the cl.ubs, the
results table (a regular feature in the
"good old days) made a jubilant
come-back. This enabled clubs to
let the rest of IC know about the
progress in their respective
activities rather than having to write
tedious reports, which as we all
know, are very hard to come by,
especially those that actually tell us
what really happened during a
game.
The less well known clubs also
had their moments in the year. The
T H Huxley (come Humanist)
Society mourned the death of Gene
Rodenbury, the creator of Star
Trek, (yes, he's dead Jim), while
the Chess Club organised The
Mestel Challenge: 16 simultaneous
games of chess against the former
British champion, of which he lost
only one. IC SEDS also played their
part by inviting leading names in the
space world to gives talks on the
space shuttle and the appolo
missions. And what about the canoe
water-poloists who gamely
conceded a match against Bath, all
in the name of sport! However,
later on in January, they did manage
a win or two, but as with all good
things, this is when I lost touch with
them and can't honestly say what
became of them.
So, what major award winning
achievements did IC clubs attain
during the year? Well, the Dance
Club won the annual Intervarsity
Dancing Competition, held in the
Sheffield Octagon, by beating their
old rivals Cambridge in the final.
This was a tense affair, with both
colleges producing fine
performances, but the exceptional
dancing of the Waltz and Quickstep
pairs, in the final, managed to edge
the result in IC's favour. Further
afield, the IC First Eight Boat Crew
travelled to Japan to compete in
their version of the Henley Regatta.
Having won their heat, by beating
a very strong American crew (five
of the oarsmen being
internationals), they faced Bristol
University in the final together with
two Japanese teams. The final took
place in terrible conditions, but with
true gritty determination, the IC
crew beat the opposition to clinch
victory and retain their title. With
the entire race screened live on
Japanese television, the Boat Club
must truly now have an
international reputation!
In our domestic scene, St Mary's
Rugby X V emphatically won the
Hospitals Cup (the oldest rugby
competition in the world) by beating
University College 49-0 in the final.
In the process Mary's created three
