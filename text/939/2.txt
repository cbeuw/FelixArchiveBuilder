Letters Felix 939 24 June 1992
On and on and on Not Apathetic
Dear Adam,
Pool old Declan, we have
obviously hit a sore point for him
to go on the way he does. Through
your letters column, may we clarify
our position regarding some of the
relevant points Declan has raised.
Conservative Students have a
membership of over 10,000 making
us the largest voluntary student
political organisation in the country;
despite this, Declan's opinion that
we are setting the pace in student
reforms, rather overstates our
influence.
Our efforts to date have been
largely to press for liberation of
students from compulsory
membership of the NUS and
Student Unions; it is not our policy
to destroy the college unions and the
services they provide.
As for the Students' Charter,
which at time of writing, has not yet
been launched, we eagerly await its
Dear Adam,
Last week's front page story,
with its shock horror headline,
'Furse Row as Southside faces
Demolition', will have misled those
of your readers who still believe
that what is printed must be true.
Let me tell you how I see it:
Southside is a massive concrete
structure. Love it or hate it—it is
here to stay. The foundations are
not crumbling. It was not designed
for a 25 year life. I would be ever
so surprised if it were not still
standing, equally solidly, at the turn
of the next century—though neither
of us might then find it entirely easy
to communicate our feelings on the
subject.
Furse House would be a
marvellous addition to Imperial
College. There are not many
opportunities to acquire a major
building quite so close to the
College. I know of no one who
disagrees with that judgement. How
much can we afford to pay for it?
Well, now you are entering an area
where the number of opinions will
be precisely equal to the number of
those looking at the problem. That
leads to debate. There has not been,
is not and will not be a 'row'.
The Residence Strategy
Discussion document was just
that—a document for discussion. It
has been widely disseminated. It
presents the clearest appraisal of the
College residences that we have
assembled so far. It received
accolades (—some from me); it
received criticisms (—some from
arrival; however, the party that
produces a commitment promising
choice for students as to which
bodies they wish to join will be the
party to legitimately claim to be
both the defender of freedom and
the voice of students. We as
Conservative Students expect the
Government to rise to that
challenge.
I am pleased Declan has a strong
sense of realism, his regarding of
the '92 election as 'One to lose'.
Clearly the '79, '87 and '96/7
elections may be held in similar
regard.
Finally may I offer personal
congratulations on the general
standard of Felix under your
control, I am told that its quality
exceeds that of previous years.
I remain the 'Enemy Within'.
Yours,
James Baker,
Secretary ICU ConSoc.
me) partially on what was in it and
partially on what was omitted. That
was the purpose of the exercise1
.
No, I was not 'cold with fury' on
reading the letter written by the
wardens. I noted a tendency to view
glasses half empty, rather than half
full—but that does not affect the
objective nature of the comments
received.
The Working Party will produce
a revised version which will seek to
make amendments—additions,
deletions and corrections. Far from
seeking to 'cancel the publication of
the report' I recommend that we
bring out the revised edition, in the
light of all the comments received,
as soon as humanly possible.
How soon is that? Well here that
is a problem and it goes under the
name of Universities Funding
Council (UFC). The research
assessment documentation has to be
submitted to them by 30 June. It is
a monstrous task which has burnt
up a great deal of academic staff
time as well as that of some key
people in the administration. There
have been other loads, again
imposed by the U F C , on, amongst
others, the Planning Department.
There simply has not been time to
devote to the revised version of the
Residence report this month, with
luck it will happen before people go
on vacation. As soon as it is to
hand, I will be glad to send you a
copy.
Yours sincerely,
Sir Eric Ash.
Dear Adam.
There has been much written
about the lack of attendance" at
UGMs in past issues. The blame
has been almost exclusively laid on
the lack of student interest. I would
like to suggest that there lies only
half of the problem.
The other half lies in the fact that
most of us are completely ignorant
of when and where these meetings
are happening.
As a fairly serious 'Raggie' and
as regular visitor to the Felix office
I consider myself well acquainted
with the Union. I have been to 2
UGMs this year, both of which I
was directly involved with. I
probably would have attended more
but I only found out about them
after they wereTong finished. Last
term I proposed Rachel Mountford
for the post of Rag Chair, and as
such assumed that I might be
required to attend her election.
When I tried to find out when the
relevant U G M was it took me the
best part of a week. Even the
usually well-informed Felix staff
couldn't tell me when or where it
was. Eventually I found the Hon-
Sec who was full of useful
information.
It is a rather sad state of affairs
when people have to actively go out
of their way to put forward a vote
Dear Adam,
As an observer I must comment
on the infantile reply you made to
Mr Proctor's letter in Felix 938 (12
June 1992). Mr Proctor's attention
will obviously be brought to the
annonymity issue if the letter in
question attacks 'his parish' and, in
some cases, him personally, but is
this a reason to disregard the
principle? I think not. If the
individual told the president that he
had written the letter, why withhold
his name anyway? Is it a cheap trick
by the author to gain attention in
these days of his waning popularity?
As for finding fault in the letter, no
one who knows the author would
take his opinion seriously enough to
waste their time doing so. If,
indeed, C & G U is so terrible, why
is he so keen to be popular?
The comments in your letter have
the overtones of a spoilt brat who
is exploiting his control of the paper
to humiliate a person who has
actually got off his backside to try
and do something for the hoards of
apathetic students at Imperial. He
is not doing it for personal gain
because there is no gain from the
hapless task of President. Maybe he
that generally will hardly affect
their lives.
Is it not part of the Hon-Sec's job
descripion to let the student body
know that there are decisions to be
made?
As things stand, the majority of
the people that know about and
attend UGMs are friends of the
people that are trying to pass
motions. During the last meeting
that I went to, almost half of the
students there were involved with
Third World First who were, once
again, trying to pass a rather
controversial motion. This, I am
sure, is not representative of student
opinion.
I hope that next year the Hon-
Sec's job will be better fulfilled.

Dear Adam,
Re: editorial Felix 938
concerning Felix receiving
coverage in the national press.
Who would have believed that a
small group of students delaying the
distribution of a students newspaper
by three days could be newsworthy
enough to reach the pages of the
Independent?

has made mistakes, he is human
after all, but we all know how easy
it is to criticise other's performance
from afar. Maybe his biggest
mistake was believing he could
improve C & G U , it can only be as
active as the students it caters for.
One thing I do agree with you on
is that the President could do far
more damage than you ever could.
Those of us who attend Guild's
events regularly can see, at a
glance, that you have little idea of
what you are talking about. The
power has certainly gone to your
head. As for snideness, I am sure
it is nothing to be proud of. Maybe
you should spend as much time
perfecting Felix as you have
practicing your juvenile behaviour.
After four years at Imperial College
I can honestly say that this year's
Felix has been worse than other
years. I hope that next year's editor
is capable fo taking criticism of all
kinds in a more mature manner. In
this case it will not be necessary for
the students to resort to your tactics
in order to retailliate.
Yours sincerely,
Rachel D.R. Smith, Mech Eng 3.
