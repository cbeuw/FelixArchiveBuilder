'And it's me, Frenzied Chatter,
here at the thunderball arena with
a simply GI-NOR-MOUS event on
this evening!' Yes, the sector one
werewolves are played the sector
nine neanderthals and it looks to be
a B R U T A L game in store for us
tonight!'
An unbelievingly tanned face split
apart to reveal ivory white teeth
glowing in the U V light, behind
Frenzied flags and banners were
being waved in the massive arena
by an ecstatic audience.
'Yes, we've got an EC-STAT-IC
audience here waiting for their
teams to emerge from their pens on
to the pitch. Rumour has it that the
neanderthal team have attempted
regressing back to dinosaurs. Is
there much truth to this Rumour?'
The camera swivelled to where
Rumour Monger sat in a helpfully
expansive chair.
'Well, Frenzied, you can see the
benefits they would have if they
succeeded. A team always hopes to
be able to walk over their opponents
but if they could physically do it!
Well, they'd win the league for
sure.'
'So will we be seeing thirty foot
high lizards on the pitch then this
evening?'
'Well, I don't think so. You see,
Frenzied, meat eating dinosaurs
have vestigial arms so even though
they'd be able to eat the entire
opposing team they wouldn't be
able to move the ball off the centre
spot. Senior tacticians in the
neanderthal camp, known as the
shamen in the big tent, put forward
several ways of overcoming this but
then realised that their team
wouldn't be able to get through the
player's tunnel and so gave up.'
'And the werewolves, any
interesting news?'
'Yes, the sector one werewolves
are known as the thinking man's
thunderball team. One of the
reasons for this being their
introduction of the then unknown
tactic of protecting the man with the
ball and staying with him when he's
running. This was unheard of in a
game where coaches spent most of
their time training the team not to
fight over the ball. But the tactic
worked and the pack system is a
major in today's game.'
'And the news?'
'Well, Frenzied, this use of
tactics was a major strain on the
minds of the team and the news is
that the recent attempt by their
coach to get them to pass the ball
resulted in him being slowly eaten
by the front row.'
' A - M A Y - Z I N G ! That's
G R E A T , Rumour. There's still a
few minutes folks before the teams
come on so we're going to show
some clips of previous games,
S T A A A A A A Y T U N E D ! '
'Okay Stress.'
The assistant talked to him while
he fed the contents of the wolf suit
some more pills.
'You know you need to take these
red pills to boost your military
chemicals otherwise you'll be killed
before you even reach the pedestal.
Now these blue pills are to help the
red pills if they get into any
problems. The green pills are to
watch out for any trouble and the
yellow pills are along for moral
support.'
'Are all these necessary? I've had
enough stuck in me as it is. The
lepton's probably doing this just to
have his fun.'
'Don't be paranoid and drink up.'
In vital parts of Stress's internal
parallel. And the teams are coming
on to the pitch!!!'
'Thank you, Frenzied. The teams
are coming on to the pitch now and
the neanderthals are showing no
signs of nerves, in fact no indication
of mental activity at all! At the other
end the captain of the werewolves,
Bloodfang, has been thrown a piece
of Sirloin steak by a very attractive
female fan. The rest of the team are
howling and whistling while their
captain eats the token of admiration.
And the horn has gone signalling
the fifteen second countdown to
fence raise.'
Pulling his helmet on over his
wolf mask Stress positioned himself
at the back of the pack.
The Inner System
metabolism antibodies were fighting
a losing battle tyring to evict
molecule squatters from a drug
ridden flat. Unknown to them an
even bigger gang of no goods were
arriving for an unofficial party and
were notorious for smashing up the
place as part of the fun.
Stress began to walk away.
'Wait'.
The assistant sprayed him with a
foul smell.
'Got to smell right, that's the only
way the wolves recognise each
other.'
Pilled up and stinking Stress
slipped in behind the rest of the
werewolf team as they walked to the
pitch .
'And the atmosphere in the
stadium is A - M A Y - Z I N G ! The
crowd is wild with anticipation
waiting for their teams who have
gone wild with chemicals. The
hollowglam cheerleaders are
executing their dances in perfect
precision thanks to their 3D
projectors being wired up in
'The teams are assembling in
front of the fence. The neanderthals
are hopping down in expectation
except one who is urinating by the
wall, the clock reaches zero and the
frence is up!!'
Bloodfang grabbed for the ball
too soon, grazed the fence and
jumped back with an electric shock.
The neanderthal grabbed the club,
rattling the skulls around his neck
as he held it aloft in triumph. Stress,
suffering the beginning of another
metabolic change, watched the
tribal leader knock an approaching
werewolf to the ground and run
straight at Stress.
'Grog has the ball and is heading
for goal, the only werewolf between
him and a point is a mangey
half-back.'
Unable to move his muscles as
they were being restructured Stress
watched helplessly as the
neanderthal approached, screaming
his battlecry. Swinging the club
behind he brought it down towards
Stress's head.
