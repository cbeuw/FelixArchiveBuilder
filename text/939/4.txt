Editorial Felix 939 24 June 1992
I do not relish causing irritation,
surprising as it may sound. But this
has never stopped me from doing
so if there is even so much as a
smidgen of a reason to, real or
imagined. Hence the oft-flung
vitriol contained within these pages.
I hope it was of some use.
Many apologies are extended to
those who have!

The Union
It would be an overflKment to,

It is expected that t r shflH
of about twenty iple^^lt
highly trained in their respective
fields, all older and more
experienced and all held together by
three or four managers who have
had a lifetime's experience of
getting their own way. These
administrators have been given a
brief to make the College more
cost-effective, to commercialise it,
in effect. No doubt a caveat has
been given that damage to student
life should be minimised, but I
suspect this comes quite low on the
list of priorities.
The purpose of the Union should
be defined, and once defined,
adhered to. Is it to educate four
students a year in the ways of
politics, or is it to forward student
welfare? The ability to decide this
is yours; is the good fortune of one
sabbatical candidate all you demand
of your vote? Felix is here to inform
you of the machinations of bodies
such as the Union, but we have, on
occasion, met with intransigents.
For instance Dr Schroter, who is a
fine Union Senior Treasurer, has
told me that he does not
communicate with Felix 'on
principle.' Dr Schroter is not alone
in this reticence, but since he does
a good job, I find his view
confusing.
In much the same vein, it seems
likely that Mandy Hurford, the
Union Manager, will attempt Jo
bring in a staff protocol next year,
which will prohibit any Union
meeting or publication from
mentioning Union staff. Seems
innocuous? It would effectively
stifle all comment on the Union.
The reason given for this protocol
is that staff complaints should 'go
through the correct channels,'
namely the sabbaticals or the Union
Manager. The former will do
nothing as they are unlikely to be
au fait with man-management and
the latter will try to smooth the
waves and calm things down (a
much-needed talent in a student
union), ie the whole issue would be
fogged out. Even worse, the issue
raised at a Union
and lost forever in a
k of forgiveness. I
thought. As do most
saulted Union Duty
Officers. This is the sort of thing the
Government can point to as an

because quite soon it may have the
financial rug removed from under
it. All these faults and many more
are only there because you let them
be. It is your responsibility, and you
will be responsible when you are
disenfranchised and bemoaning
your miserable lot because you
were a miserable lot.
The College
I am afraid you cannot dismiss the
College administrators as satanic
hell-spawn and by so doing waive
all responsibility. You can affect
them - it is just that it takes more
time and effort. They have a job to
do and they generally appear to do
it well. It is unfortunate that in most
cases their job descriptions run
counter to the needs of student
welfare, particularly accom-
modation. Why anybody would
want to run a department which
controls the single most
problematic, expensive and vital
piece of student life I cannot
understand. I consider it obvious
that to do this job would inevitably
result in the reception of more than
usual attention and insults. So, on
a personal basis, I apologise
unconditionally to Mr Marshall for
the amount of grief he has had to
take, and I apologise to everybody
in College residences with a
legitimate grievance that more has
not been made of it. Such are the
paradoxes of the job.
You may note the disparity in
length between the Union and
College sections in this editorial. Is
this because I have greater
sympathy with the College? No - it
is because I know more about the
Union. College administrators are
very good at closing ranks - the
College is not democratic. The
Union has managed to deal with the
often bizarre attentions of its own
press, and I feel credit must be
given to the Union for being so
democratic up until now. Likewise
credit should go to College'for
dealing with Felix by completely
ignoring it, which is far more
effective but much more frustrating
for both the researcher and the
readership.
Many thanks are due to the
Rector, Sir Eric Ash, for providing
the Felix Office with two
distribution trolleys at the beginning
of the year. I hear tha

The CCUs
The phrase 'banana republic'
springs to mind when referring to
these wasteful anachronisms.
Rather like the monarchy, there is
no reason why they should not exist
if people want them, but I fail to see
why they are given any sort of say
in how the total organisation runs.
The only useful purpose they could
serve would be through
departmental representatives, which
is excellent as far as it goes, but
tends to be as erratic as you would
expect from a voluntary service.
What other purpose do they
serve? Surely all the clubs and
societies could be financed as well,
if not better, by ICU? They only
exist because of the ancient origins
of the College and they still uphold
the nineteenth century ideal and the
Jingoism of gentlemen's exclusive
clubs, run by a few for the purposes
of that same few. The playground
of the socially inept and emotionally
immature, it is almost beyond belief
that elitist squads of MI5 rejects can
gather ranks in the name of their bit
of metal in order to steal someone
else's bit of metal. This pathetic
tribalism seems to form the
powerbase for juvenile politicking.
This is fine if you want it, and I am
certainly guilty of some such, but
I am not entirely sure that this is
what taxpayers think they are
paying for, bearing in mind the
present Government's attitude, all
of us (including Felix) ought to start
looking towards greater efficiency.
St Mary's.
The majority of St Mary's students
are extremely anti-Imperial and
especially anti-ICU. Three years
ago I started to regularly attempt to
research news stories relevant to St
Mary's. I noticed at the time that
very little was forthcoming - and
this disinterest has slowly grown
into contempt and aggression over
the intervening years. This has left
me with the conclusion that they
wish to be left alone and out of
Imperial College as a whole. I see
no reason why this wish should not
be granted. St Mary's Student
Union were forced to join with ICU
because the two college adminis-
trations wished to merge the two
colleges for financial reasons - there
is no commonality between the
student populations. I hope that
Jonty will do better, but I am afraid
I have totally given up on them, and
this saddens me as they could add
so much more to IC life.
And so to the future.
I don't know next year's Union
Office Sabbaticals very well, so I
my comments are based on very
little. Chris Davidson - next year's
President - has been showing great
interest in Union affairs this term.
This is a very good sign and my
instincts tell me that he will be able
to deal with the College - and Felix
- in a more mature manner. This
will probably not be good news for
Felix as we thrive on presidential
juvenilia. Rick Bilby - next year's
Deputy President - has not been
seen in weeks. Dom Wilkinson -
Hon Sec (Events) - is still heavily
involved in Ents and so should
know what that side of his job is all
about. My only concern is that as
he stood only on the second election
he may have doubts about wanting
to do the job. Jonty Beavan - Felix
Editor - has got a lot to learn about
more-or-less everything very
quickly. But being intelligent and
usually hard-working, I think he
will be able to do it.
The College will get a new
Rector, appointed not elected, who
will most likely be an opinionated
authoritarian carefully selected so
as to minimise obstruction to the
ongoing costcutting. The
government will institute a 'students
charter' which will contain the key
words 'democratise' and 'choice,'
and will offer nothing but words
and threats to paralyse most student
unions. Polytechnics will become
universities and increase
competition for research and
government money.
The College will grind slowly
closer towards being a commercial
operation, the students will still not
care a jot, remain wilfully ignorant
of everything except their course
and whinge about things they could
do something about. In the words
of Ford Prefect to the
Golgafrinchans, 'you're going to go
extinct. You know that don't you.'
How can I be so sure? Why because
the only people who will complain
about the negativity of this editorial
- if anyone does - will be a few self-
important hacks. The rest will not
think it applies to them. Quod erat
demonstrandum.
