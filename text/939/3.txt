Fifteen major hospitals will close
and 5.000 beds will be axed,
according to a report issued
yesterday. The report from the
'Kings Fund Acute Services
Initiative' says that inner city
residents have difficulty in getting
standard hospital treatment because
of the concentration of specialist
provision in central London.
Entitled 'London Health Care
2010', the report calls for a radical
shift of resources to keep London
as a world centre for medicine.
The King's Fund, the largest
independent health research body in
London, states that the general drift
of people from central London has
resulted in an expensive pattern of
health care which is no longer
sustainable. It recommends the
consolidation of London's medical
research and teaching capacity into
four strong Faculties of Medicine
within London University, and a
reduction in the numbers of medical
students in the capital.
The Goverment's Health
Secretary, Virginia Bottomley, has
welcomed the report. 'The
Government will not shirk from
making difficult decisions on the
future of London's health services,'
she said, repeating the message
spelt out by junior minister Brian
Mawhinney last month. Labour's
Shadow Health Minister, Robin
Cook, said that ministers were not
honest about London health policies
before the election. 'The new
market forces in the NHS are
driving London hospitals towards a
cliff-face. Ministers must now
accept the case for a planned
strategy for London's health
services'.
The report comes before the
results of the government's official
inquiry into London health care are
published. The Tomlinson inquiry
was set up in October 1991 to
examine 'how London's health
care, medical education and
research should be planned in the
1990s.' Sir Bernard Tomlinson, a
former chairman of the Northern
Regional Health Authority, has
been meeting with health
authorities, funding bodies, the
London University, medical schools
and teaching hospitals, and was
expected to report in November.
The publication of his report may
now be brought forward by the
Government, in the light of the
King's report.
The conventional wisdom before
the King's report was that
Tomlinson would recommend the
closure of two hospitals and one
medical school. The left wing
pressure group, London Health
Emergency (LHE), had said that St
Thomas' Hospital and Charing
Cross Hospital would close. These
reports were vigorously dismissed
at the time by the hospitals.
'London Health Emergency are to
health what the Socialists Workers
are to politics' said a spokesman for
St. Thomas's. L H E forecast that the
Tomlinson inquiry would close
2,000 beds, which can be compared
to the figure of 5,000 quoted by
King's. L H E Campaigns Director,
Geoff Martin, said yesterday that
Westminster Medical School is
expected to move to the
Westminster and Chelsea site.
IC has been considering a merger
between St Mary's Hospital
Medical School and the Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
School. In a paper to a recent
College Executive Committee
meeting, Professor Peter Richards,
Dean of St Mary's, proposed the
Hospitals to Close
The new Westminster and Chelsea Hospital on the Fulham Road
the King's report was paving the
way for Tomlinson. 'The Kings
Fund report will give an air of
academic respectability to the
carnage that is being set up for
health services in London.' The
L H E statement was dismissed by
Simon Stockhill, president of St.
Mary's Hospital Medical School
Students Union, who called it 'pure
propaganda', adding that the King's
Fund report said 'nothing new.'
Attention is now focusing on the
Charing Cross and Westminster
Hospital on Fulham Palace Road,
and the Westminster and Chelsea
Hospital, currently being built on
the Fulham Road. The new
hospital, described by L H E as a
'drain on resources', is expected to
take over beds currently in the old
Westminster and Charing Cross
hospitals. The Charing Cross beds
are to be taken by the Royal
Marsden Hospital, the Brompton
Hospital, and the Hammersmith
Hospital, leading to the formation
of a specialist cancer hospital on the
Charing Cross site. Such a specialist
hospital would be regarded as
inappropriate for teaching purposes,
and the Charing Cross and
establishment of an enlarged
medical school spanning the
Imperial College (South
Kensington), St Mary's
(Paddington) and Westminster and
Chelsea (Fulham) sites. The
proposal currently being considered
is for the first two years of a
medical course (the basic medical
course) to be taught in the new
Imperial Cancer Research building
on the South Kensington site, with
the course being completed either
in Paddington or Fulham. It has also
been suggested that the management
school could be enlarged to teach
health service management as part
of a new medical course.
Professor Richards, currently a
candidate for the post of Rector,
regards the merger proposal in
terms of IC taking the lead in
medicine in West London, and
becoming the centre of medical
research and teaching in the area.
He has expressed the hope that a
new School of Medicine would
have an annual intake of 250
undergraduate students, and that the
School would attract greater
funding from the Universities
Funding Council for the College.
