24 June 1992 Felix 939 News Review
production of 'Grease', began a war
of words (short and unintelligible -
mostly grunts) with Felix, and
particularly the Felix editor, Adam
Harrington.
The CCUs had a bit more to
worry them when it became clear
that the College Union Office was
about to start investigating ultra
vires (literally, out of rules)
payments, otherwise known as the
illegal use of union (taxpayers)
money. It was revealed that C C U
balls had between them spent a total
of a few thousand pounds on
complementary tickets. In a
separate incident, the Royal College
of Science Union found that its
finances were in such disarray that
its senior treasurer considered not
signing any more cheques. The
upset this caused among the CCUs
was nothing compared to the chaos
and confusion in other places. Ultra
vires payments are defined by a
letter from the Attorney General's
office, issued in 1983, with the only
problem being that even the
Attorney General's office has
difficulty interpretating the rules.
The losers in the whole affair are
the Imperial College Day Nursery,
which had its I C U payments
stopped several years ago, and the
Silwood Park Day Nursery, which
was threatened with similar
financial starvation. The payments
were stopped because it was felt
Jonathan
Griffiths, then a
sprightly 29
they were ultra vires. As it turns
out, they may not be. To raise their
profile, the Imperial College Day
Nursery held a 'Nursery Awareness
Day', involving stalls, fun, and lots
of little children striking terror in
the hearts of those timid Southside
residents.
ICU Rugby Club members have
also been showing us all they've got
this year, in some cases far too
literally. Their dinner was the scene
of 'outrageous and obscene
behaviour' (an ICU sabbatical). 'It
got a bit out of hand' (ICU Rugby
Club Captain). Indeed. The affair
provoked a certain element of navel
gazing in ICU, the end result being
a new draft policy on sexual
harassment. The policy was
discussed at Tuesday's Annual
General Meeting (AGM), and a
copy of the document can be
inspected at the ICU office. The
policy will become official policy
if it is ratified at a further general
union meeting.
Other peculiar practices (apart
from rugby) this year include
mascotry, which was described as
'the sport of Gentlemen' in a letter
to Felix by Paul Kendall, putting it
along side Bear-Baiting, Dog
Fighting and Fox Hunting.
Constructive things mascotry has
achieved this year include breaking
the leg of Stephen Dorman, a first
year chemistry student; destroying
the door of the Mines' Union office;
and encouraging tired, long
departed, old hacks who should
have more sense, to play 'James
Bond' across the College in pursuit
of large chunks of metal. Gold?
Nothing so useful.
Money was dealt with in better
ways by Imperial College Rag,
despite having several internal
wrangles. Rag Chair Penguin,
occasionally known as Marc Ellis,
threatened to resign more times than
he has flippers. When Mr Ellis
actually did resign he was almost
immediately re-elected with only a
weak challenge from Aled Fenner,
who was also to mount a weak
contest for the Hon Sec elections,
but more later. How many millions
Rag has collected has yet to be
discovered, but contributions to the
Maxwell pension fund are not being
ruled out.
St Mary's also had a successful
Rag week this year. Unfortunately
this coincided with the hustings for
Sabbatical Elections. This brought
back memories of last year's
hustings in which Jonathan Griffiths
(then a sprightly 29) had his shirt
burned. Apart from the exchange of
large quantities of shaving foam and
bribery by one
of the Felix
editor
candidates
bribery by one of the Felix editor
candidates (/ wonder which one -
Ed), the Hustings came to a
peaceful conclusion. All the
candidates emerged alive but
mauled. The IC (South Kensington)
Hustings were a more sedate affair.
Zzzzz.
Sabbatical Elections are usually
harshly fought because candidates
really have something to lose at the
ballot box, apart from some face.
.1992 was no exception and with a
large media coverage (Felix,
STOIC and IC Radio) the stakes
were raised even higher. Publicity
rules for election were ignored by
many candidates and one managed
to get elected after going over
budget. This flaunting of the rules
was matched by the contempt with
which the media regarded them.
Indeed, the novel step was taken of
covering the elections according to
news values. This proved to be too
much for some. Nick Allen
complained strongly about bias after
he was interviewed on IC Radio,
and Aled Fenner was not much
happier. Chris Davidson,
apparently, thrived on his
interview, while Angelo Gardini
overslept, and so missed his 8pm
slot. Phil Sharpe went one better.
While he couldn't make his
interview, he did know one St
Mary's student who could fill in for
him, even though he was
considerably under the influence. In
fact, not only was he 'on the piss',
he decided to take it as well, live
and on air.
Chris Davidson was elected as
President, defeating Anthony
Baldwin, New Election and Angelo
Gardini. Rick Bilby was elected as
Deputy President, in preference to
New Election and Phil Sharpe.
Jonty Beavan was. elected Felix
Editor, defeating New Election and
Toby Jones. After a win by New
Election over Nick Allen and Aled
Fenner, and the subsequent re-
election, Dominic Wilkinson was
elected Honorary Secretary
(Events), over Toby Jones and New
Election.
