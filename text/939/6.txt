News Review Felix 939 24 June 1992
This summer will see the departure
of yet another group of lucky
graduates, "with souls intact and
bank balances in tatters. To add
penury to poverty, they will
probably be sent a leaflet
advertising the wonders of Imperial
College Alumni, entitled 'Imperial
College and you'. A copy of this
useful document has reached Felix
with the title altered by some wit to
read 'Imperial College and your
Money'. One could be forgiven for
thinking that this comment sums up
the way Imperial has been run this
past year.
Manager, called the Halls
'generally shabby'. One resident
called it 'living like squatters'; Mr
Daniels responded with 'faults
cannot be rectified overnight'. Or
indeed annually. Read next year's
Felix for news of sudden
developments.
More sinister events occurred
later in the first term in Southside
Hall, home to 374 students and
commonly called a 'fire hazard' by
polite members of the College, a
'death trap' by those that live there.
A lift in the Hall was set alight by
a 'socially challenged' (moronic)

this year's news
The new intake arrived at the end
of September to take their places in
Hall. First years who had not
brought any linen with them found
that they had to pay for bed covers
and pillow cases that, in the past,
had been provided free. Paying for
using College Linen seems
reasonable, until you discover that
new first years had been assured by
their departments that bedclothes
would be provided free. As ever,
the departments found that they
were one of the last groups in
college to be informed of anything.
This was one of the repetitive
themes of the year.
It was not long after that the
overall state of College
accommodation was also being
called into question. Letters of
protest were received in Felix about
Southwell and Holbein halls in
Evelyn Gardens. Leaks in roofs,
lack of stable desks and cupboards
and inadequate cooking facilities
among the more minor complaints.

Luckily, the blaze did not spread,
but due to the frequency of false
alarms in Southside no one bothered
to answer the alert. The Police
verdict was 'lucky to escape without
some people dead'. This was
followed by a false alarm in the
Mechanical Engineering building,
where the departmental
superintendent only found out about
the emergency when the Fire
Engines arrived. You could be
forgiven for asking what would
happen if there was a real fire at
Imperial. Answers on the back of
a firelighter.
The state of University buildings
all over the country was condemned
in a working party report of the
University Funding Council in mid-
November. In a unique and never
to be repeated interview with
student media, Gordon Marshall,
Director of Imperial College
Estates, said that buildings in the
College were 'getting tired'. As is
he. Another source of student
irritation was the increase in food
charges in Linstead Hall. The cost
of living there is so great that the
rent of a single room would leave
you with £100 change from your
grant cheque. Our advice is to eat
the cheque. It's cheaper and more
nutritious.
Students were stung into action in
the Spring Term after Felix
reported that students staying in
Southside Halls could have to pay
£18 a night to stay over the Easter
Vacation. A petition circulating
around Southside gathered over 100
signatures in a few hours. The
contents of the petition was a
description of the state of
accommodation at Imperial. This
description did not worry those in
high places at Imperial. What
worried our Lords and Masters was
the threat to send the letter to all
schools and Sixth-Form colleges
which may send students here.
Angus Fraser, Managing Director,
and the elusive Gordon Marshall
got onto the case immediately;
meeting the students who had
gathered the petition. They listened,
spoke, but said nothing. The
delegation of students left, satisfied
only by winding up the Director of
Estates until he had to be pacified
by the Managing Director. How
soothing.
Things improved for some.
Those students who had exams in
the first week of the summer term
were to be allowed to return to a
room in Hall so long as it wasn't
being used for those all-important
conferences. There was a warm
welcome back for the residents in
Tizard Hall. Some found that their
room had been flooded by sewage,
compliments of the Estates division.
The advice from the College was 'to
keep an eye on your health',
presumably after signing a little
form absolving Imperial from any
responsibility if harm were to
result.
The news that Gardens restaurant
is to close came as a surprise to
many, if only because very few
people actually know where it is.
That Southside Bar is to go on tour
proved an altogether greater shock.
Southside's very own den of
iniquity will now move to the
Sherfield building. What would
happen if the whole of Southside
was to clpse became a very real
question, as it was reported that the
Hall was near the end of its
expected lifetime. Replacing the
student beds with rooms in Furse
House on Queen's Gate Terrace has
been on the Rector's agenda for
some time. Whether the Imperial
College Residence account could
afford this £5 million purchase was
to be contained in Report of the
