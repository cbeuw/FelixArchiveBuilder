Felix Felix 939 24 June 1992
Well it's been a storming year for
Rag with over a hundred people
benefitting from our wonderful
incentive scheme. For anyone who
doesn't know, raising £50 gets you
a Rag mug, £ 1 5 0 for a Rag
collector's T-shirt and if you've
raised the amazing sum of £300 you
become the proud owner of a 300
club sweatshirt. We'd like to take
this opportunity to thank everybody
who's collected for Rag this year
and record here for posterity those
people who've collected enough for
an incentive (or three!)
Anyone who hasn't yet picked up
their mug can collect it from the
Rag office (second floor, east
staircase of Union Building). If
you've already got your mug and
fancy getting another we'll be
selling spare ones off while stocks
last for £2.00.
In Case you feel you've missed
out on all these goodies let me
assure you that the Rag year isn't
over yet! We still have collections
at the Proms Concerts in the Albert
Hall and the Royal Tournament. If
you're going to be in London at
anytime during the summer and
want to do a spot of collecting come
up to the Rag office before the end
of term to find out more.
Remember, you too could get some
of these lovely goodies.
Rag's Bounty
Midsummer '92
It's the end of term and we're
organising a party for everyone.
You may have been so emersed in
exams that you couldn't think
beyond the day—so open up your
diaries now and make a date for
Midsummer 92 on 26 June at
Sherfield—no one need celebrate
the end of term alone. Relax in the
festive summer spirit of the
occasion, put your troubles behind
you, come and join us at Sherfield
for a fun packed evening.
Midsummer 92 gets off to a
sporting start at 6.00pm when
croquet makes a welcome
comeback on the Queens Law. The
Imperial College Orchestra
conducted by Richard Dickens play
Richard Strauss Serenades at 6.30
and delicious hors d'oeuvres will be/
served by some of the 22 overseas
societies represented at IC. Other
entertainments before a fantastic
dinner at 8.30 include jugglers,
wandering musicians, fortune
telling and portraiture. And to
round off this fabulous summer
evening? Toe tapping jazz from our
favourite jazz band—the perfect end
to a hectic term!
Tickets at £9.50 include all
musical entertainments and dinner
and are available from HUB, Room
355 Sherfield extensions
3021/3405.
