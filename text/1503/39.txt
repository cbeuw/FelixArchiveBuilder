were also opportunities to befriend
students through playing educational
games. Through my volunteering ex-
perience, I learnt a great deal about
myself and how to relate better with
younger children and other people.”
We asked Ada what her views were
on completing CV2012 Award and
she told us that “it has been a great
experience. I was able to add to my
local community whilst gaining new
skills and learning how to critically
assess the skills I was gaining in or-
der to make the best use of them in
the future.”
CV2012 Award Scheme is currently
open for applications and info ses-
sions are run until December 6. For

Recognition for volunteering
Have you ever considered volunteer-
ing? Or do you already volunteer for
example as an elected officer in one of
the Clubs & Societies, or are involved
in some other extra-curriculum activi-
ties within the local community?
During the last few years the Col-
lege has rewarded those students
who are doing extra activities on top
of their busy study schedules. The
CV2012 Award is something an in-
creasing number of students are con-
sidering as it is an excellent addition
to anyone’s CV.
The Award is linked with the Olym-
pics in the sense that the College
aims to create momentum around the
Olympics in order to demonstrate that
our students are doing so much more
than just studying, and also to show
that the College is not just a place for

On Tuesday 15 November, a number of
brave viking souls from the Scandiavian
Society descended upon Wembley Sta-
dium to witness a football game of epic
proportions between the Kingdoms of
England and Sweden. Although the raid
ended with the first defeat for Sweden
against England in 43 years, the vikings
were deeply impressed by the perfor-
mance of our very own Zlatan Ibrahimov-
ic as well as the merry atmosphere with
over 48,000 football fans in attendance.

excellent teaching and research, but
also a vibrant place full of different
activities.
We met one of last year’s CV2012
volunteers in order to find out what
they thought about the scheme. Ada
Onwubiko, who studies chemistry,
told us that before she came to Im-
perial she spent time assisting GCSE
maths students whilst still studying
her A-levels.
As she thoroughly enjoyed this
experience she decided to join the
Pimlico Scheme but also Response
Homework Club. Pimlico Connection
places volunteers in local primary and
secondary schools for one afternoon
per week as support staff. Response
Homework Club on the other hand
offers community-based support for
young people with their school work
after the end of the school day.
Ada told us that she decided to
participate in the CV2012 scheme
as “it was a bonus to also be part of
the CV2012 scheme because it meant
I consciously had to develop profes-
sionally”.
Ada further described her role as a
volunteer: “As a lead tutor responsi-
bilities included liaising with the con-
tact teacher and the rest of the tutors,
giving an induction at the first session,
and organising a rota to ensure the
homework club was evenly supported
by tutors throughout the week.”
Ada continued: “I was able to help
students to complete homework in a
range of subjects, textiles, religious
studies as well as the expected sub-
jects. During the homework club there
