Lolcats of teh week
If there’s one thing that’s toughest to pull
off, it’s a decent headline. So, naturally,
when I see a page full of effortless puns
before articles, it’s pretty impressive.
Congratulations to this week’s Arts Section
(Pages 20–21), their comedy versus word
number potential is to be feared. Literally.
Other than a brief two second chuckle at
the wordplay on offer, this week’s section
includes mention of Tim Minchin, Richard
Herring and Greg Davies alongside the
introduction of a ‘Doodle of the Week’
competition. Notepads at the ready.
