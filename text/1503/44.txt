Appointments Brief
Reporters
Nosy? Busy-body? Cunning like a
Dr Fox? The FT is always looking
for budding hacks. Preferably not
the Johann Hari sort though. Having
to surrender his Orwell Prize. Really,
George would compare him to one of
those pigs in his book, only that his
face would be turning more porky.

Commentators
Opinionated? Irritating? Pompous?
If the answer is yes to at least two of
the above, please send in some blurb
about religion or the Tories robbing
poor people. As they say, “No FT No
Comment”. Page 4
Copy editors
If you are as pedantic as Ben Bernan-
ke and find yourself thrilled when you
spot an errant comma in The Guard-
ian, then you will be right at home ob-
noxiously sniggering at the mistakes
of others. And like Hemingway and
at the FT we like to use polysyndeton
and replace all our commas with the
word and and then our articles always
lead up to something and are just one
massive climax. Page 16
Investors
If you have too much money from that
UBS summer internship and have not
splashed it all on coke and whores,
then do send it in to Felix via cheque.
We are rather like a corrupt Saudi
Prince, nothing less than £100,000
please and we do not appreciate time-
wasters. Despite appearances, busi-
ness is sometimes black and white
(and not salmon). Page 18

A pseudo-intellectual ambassador, speaking at PETA, observes ‘all meat is red’
crunch time negotiations with David
Cameron. Pamela Anderson, a leading
PETA ambassador, was also at the table
and called upon Hugh Fearnley-Whit-
tingstall to consider fronting a “Big Cow
Fight” campaign. She failed to notice
that he was holding a meat cleaver in his
right hand.
Talks drew to a standstill when the

Meat Free Monday causes malnutrition spike Cows in one day high
By Quentin Management, feeling slight-
ly queasy in a slaughter house, and Lex-

near Yorkshire
Shares in UK farming saw a sharp fall
as markets reacted to the ecomentalist
fightback requiring food aficionados to
not eat any meat between the working
hours of 9am to 5pm on Monday.
As the nutritional sector saw a worry-
ing decline, Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, issued a
legal challenge to the move citing “the
vile disregard for human rights being
practiced in countries where senior man-
agement should simply know better”.
Jeremy Clarkson, who has a 40 per cent
share of the vegetarian-hating market, is
seeking the suspension of all walking ac-
tivities in protest and compensation for
the lack of CO2
emissions on Monday
by increasing the national speed limit to
100 mph – a call that will still frustrate
Bugatti Veyron drivers worldwide.
Cows, the first sector to publicly back
the Meat Free campaign, is an important
test case for the venture. While stocks in
Bovinae saw an early surge as the Meat
Free Monday event got underway, their
market value plummeted late afternoon
as traders caught on to news that slaugh-
ters would be doubled on Tuesday to ad-
dress a surplus in supply.

Blair indicted on
war crimes after
accidentally step-
ping into the dock
at The Hague
By Frank Exchange in Amsterdam
After multiple trips across the North
Sea, Tony Blair, former Prime Minis-
ter and current deliverer of over-priced
lectures, has finally had a trip of anoth-
er sort as he stumbled into the Interna-
tional Criminal Court on Tuesday.
Mistaking the ICC for a bank offer-
ing a non-executive board-level posi-
tion, Mr Blair strolled in, outlining in
some detail his global influence and
sway in geo-political mergers and ac-
quisitions. Once the fifteen second talk
finished, a police officer presented Mr
Blair with a warrant for his arrest.
Cherie Booth, the reputable lawyer,
who drafted the warrant, says its pur-
pose is to address the long-term sus-
picion that Mr Blair is in fact a Tory.
He has been known to be dismissive of
working class staff members, not least
his home cleaning lady.
Accused of being a Trotskyist by
staunch Conservatives due to his man-
tra of “education, education, educa-
tion” failing to specify “for the poshos
only”, it has increasingly transpired
that Mr Blair vigorously supports the
Tea Party Republican movement.
In what is as yet an unsubstanti-
ated rumour, Ms Booth is apparently
dissatisfied by Mr Blair’s over-hyped
sexual bragging in his pious work of
fiction A Journey. Mr Blair declined to
comment, awaiting further instructions
from George Bush, his chief advisor.
