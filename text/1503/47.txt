country
Sport Editor
Another week, another interview for
your intrepid Felix Sport editor. Today:
Synchronised Swimming! Yep, I know
you’re excited about this one. I meet up
with Carla, the treasurer, Delphine, the
club secretary and Zara, the club presi-
dent in 568 to talk swimming pools,
holding your breath underwater, and
fancy routines. Owing to the triple inter-
view format, this week is presented as a
Q&A session. Enjoy!
Felix Sport: So, to start off with, a
couple of questions for you guys: how
did you get into synchronised swim-
ming? Did you do it before university?
Zara Ganase: I sort of got interested
when I went to the US during the sum-
mer of 2008, and saw the blanket media
coverage of the American Olympic team
– including synchronised swimming. I
thought it would be a cool thing to try,
and found out that there was a club at
Imperial…and here I am, three years
later: Club President!
Carla Canturri-Gispert: I’ve always
loved the water, but not competitive
swimming which I find boring. Syn-
chronised swimming seemed like a lot
of fun, even though I had never done it
before uni, and I signed up when I came
to Imperial.
Delphine Rolando: I have actually
been doing this since I was 11! I picked
it up in France as a kid, but had a long
break during my studies and didn’t do
any for five years. I picked it up again
here, though, and am enjoying it as
much as ever.
FS: Okay, so two out of three com-
mittee members were complete begin-
ners before coming to Imperial. How
many members do you have? What
proportion of that is made up of be-
ginners?
DR: This year we had about ten peo-
ple sign up at freshers’ fair, and we’re
almost hitting thirty members…
CC-G: Although one thing to know is
that the club only started four years ago.
FS: So you’re growing slowly but
surely then?
ZG: I think that’s kind of the objec-
tive. We’ve sort of got three level groups:
the absolute beginners, the intermediate
people such as Carla or myself who have
done it for a couple of years, and then
there is a group of swimmers who had
started synchronised swimming before
university and want to continue, such as
Delphine.
FS: How does the competition struc-
ture work? I mean, do you have tour-
naments or things like that with other
universities?
DR: Actually, when Carla said we
formed four years ago she forgot to
mention that we’re pretty much the
only university synchronised swimming
club in the country. It really isn’t a big
thing here, and there is no such thing as
a BUCS tournament or the equivalent
for us. Having said that, we are trying to
enter a team into the French university
championships, to be able to compete in
something!
CC-G: Even that competition is rela-
tively new, it didn’t exist two years ago.
FS: What does a typical training
session consist of? Do you practice a
particular routine?
CC-G: It’s generally 45 minutes of
warmups and stretching outside the
pool, followed by an hour and a quarter
of practicing the different figures, lifts
and positions you can do in the pool.
DR: We have one main coach and two
assistant coaches, all of whom used to
represent their countries at an interna-
tional level. Our main coach Eugénie
is especially good at teaching beginners
the basics!
ZG: We actually have two sessions a
week, on Mondays at Ethos and Thurs-
days at St. Mary’s. We want to get as
many people as possible to come along,
so if you’re interested, don’t hesitate!
FS: A question about the sport itself,
because I don’t think that many peo-
ple are familiar with it: what does a
team consist of in synchronised swim-
ming?
DR: A routine is usually done by eight
swimmers, all performing the same
thing, and can last up to about five min-
utes. In the Olympics, it is an all-female
sport but outside of that more and more
guys are taking it up, and competitions
allow for mixed teams! We really want
to get more guys in as this gives you
more possibilities for lifts and other
things during a routine, because guys
just have more strength.
FS: What are the skills you need to
be good at synchro? Is it easy to prog-
ress quickly if you start from scratch?
CC-G: It isn’t too hard to learn the dif-
ferent moves and techniques involved in
synchronised swimming, you can pick
those up in a couple of weeks. However
you do need a level of fitness and mus-
cle strength to pull these off, and that’s
where it takes a lot of work.
DR: You need flexibility, core strength
and you have to learn to hold your breath
for long periods of time – these aren’t
things that come overnight. Having said
that I still think synchro is a very acces-
sible sport, and can be a lot of fun!
