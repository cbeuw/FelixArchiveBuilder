he reign of the tyrant
is over. In Italy, people
celebrated in the streets
as Berlusconi resigned;
across Europe, markets
sighed in relief and hoped that his suc-
cessor would be able to unscrew the
pooch that he so thoroughly enjoyed
screwing. The ‘it has to get worse be-
fore it can get better’ part of this finan-
cial crisis seemed to be behind us, and
Italy could get back on the road to nor-
malcy. Times, finally, are looking up.
It’s easy to forget why we got here,
why Berlusconi was allowed in the
control room for so long. There is very
little doubt that he was a terrible leader
and a pretty reproachable human being
to boot. So how could this man have
been allowed such a heavy influence in
the politics of the eighth largest econ-
omy in the world for close to twenty
years? Simply put, he was elected. On
three separate occasions, the major-
ity of voters looked at this man and
thought that, yes, that was the guy they
wanted to run their country.
Arguably, Berlusconi is amongst the
greatest failures that democracy has
ever produced, rivalled only by the
stint by a terrorist organisation in Pal-
estine (and that time which cannot be
mentioned without invoking Godwin’s
Law). He’s living proof that you don’t
need sparkling ideas to convince a na-
tion that you should lead them; a char-
ismatic demeanour and a truckload of
money to spare will suffice. He was
hailed as a media genius, as someone

The dark side of democracy
who spoke to the common man and
handled information in a modern way.
He was given far too much credit. Ber-
lusconi simply managed to play the
system.
Of course he looks like a media ge-
nius: he directly controlled three of
the six main channels of Italian televi-
sion (which exist only to propagate his
message), alongside some of the most
influential newspapers and magazines
of the country. His stranglehold was
almost total, and he made sure that it
was only his views which got across
to the general populace. He named his
first party “Hooray for Italy!”, which
is about as uncultured as it gets, and he
won on the back of the “revolutionary”
slogan “Less Taxes For Everybody”
– second only to “More Money For
Everybody” in the ranking of inanely
populist catchphrases.
Berlusconi has always been por-
trayed as an anomaly. An outlier, a
freak occurrence. But the truth is that
democracy will always be prone to
these sorts of hiccups. On paper, de-
mocracy ensures that the best course
of action is undertaken, because the
people, who bear the consequences
of those actions, get to choose; in
practice, people are a cowardly and
superstitious lot who rarely bother to
research or care about the election.
Elections, as Berlusconi showed, can
become little more than popularity
contests, with candidates winning sim-
ply because they have the tightest grip
on the information channels, and are
T
here are many ways to
travel and I like to think
that I’ve experienced
most of them. Each one
has its own charm, best
suited to different needs and situa-
tions; from the humdrum of buses to
the out-of-this-world splendour of
airplanes, and, for the adventurous
among you, the awesome majesty of
riding an ostrich to college. But there
is one form that will hold a special
place in my heart.
Little boys and train sets go hand
in hand. Little boxes with wheels on
the bottom are suddenly transformed
by the magic of the imagination into
the Flying Scotsman. Most boys out-
grow this tryst, moving on to Action
Man or football or girls, or whatever,
but I never did. In the most impres-
sionable corner of my mind, trains
will always be associated with magic
and wonder. Basically, I think they’re
pretty cool.
Now that I’m (for want of a bet-
ter word) grown-up, the games have
changed but the love affair goes on.
I remember first coming to London
and arriving at Paddington Station.
My jaw dropped as I took in the ca-
thedral of steel and steam, built by its
prophet Brunel. The trains were mod-
ern models by First Great Western
but it was not too hard to paint over
the grubby diesel engines with shin-
ing brass pistons. I wept.
I have travelled from Paddington
many times since, and from other
grand stations, but the journey is
never dull. The best form of cardio, I
have found, is pelting down the plat-
form, trying to catch the train before
it leaves. Once, when I had a suit-
case full of library books in tow, it
was just as good for weight training
as well.
And once aboard the train, I am
submerged in a most divine melting
pot. Surrounded by strangers from all
walks of life, I must sit and interact
with people I would not normally mix
with. No man is an island, said John
Donne. I can only assume he coined
this on the 9:17 from Euston. The
train is for everyone and it is where
we all meet. Apart from those bas-
tards in first class.
It goes further than that. As well as
meeting all peoples on the train, we
can travel to all times on the train. All
times after 1825, anyway. There are
small village stations out in the mid-
dle of nowhere, with tiny red brick
cottages that have not changed in a
hundred years. When the train oc-
casionally deigns to stop, the whole
village turns out to see it. But the age
of trains is not over yet. If we look to
the future, and by that I mean Japan,
trains shoot across the landscape at
impossible speeds, powered by mag-
thus able to sway public opinion. It is
not political creed or ability to govern
that put people in charge, but the abil-
ity to control the media.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not advo-
cating for some revolution to destroy
the system; I would just like to point
out that democracy, often seen as the
gold standard of governments and
hailed as the solution that, if imple-
mented, will singlehandedly lead to
the prosperity of a nation, is deeply
flawed. As with many ideas that are
great in theory, it relies on assumptions
that simply aren’t true: in this case,
that the general public is a reasoning,
rational beast which always makes the
most intelligent choices for the future.
Democracy, as it is evolving, works
better than other systems but is in
nets, gravity, faster-than-light neutri-
nos and other tools of science-fiction.
This all comes back to the same
general idea. A train ticket is a ticket
to adventure, as well as Didcot Park-
way. Very rarely have I been bored
with a train journey, and even then I
pretended to like it as so not to hurt
its feelings.
Even when the trains are gone,
the magic lingers. In the woods near
where I live in Cardiff, there is an
old railway line. The tracks have
been ripped up long ago but it still
resists the encroachment of nature.
For maybe a mile or more, an impos-
sibly straight path leads through the
forest, occasionally overshadowed by
brickwork arches. There is a humble
serenity about walking in the wake of
something long passed.
And yet, I can’t help looking over
my shoulder in case the 17:36 to
Tongwynlais is coming.

danger of falling in disrepair due to
complacency on our part. Serious laws
on conflict of interest and greater em-
phasis towards technocracy would be
desirable in order to avoid a populist
drift of the institutions. Most impor-
tantly, we need to reconsider the way
in which we, the public, approach it.
Holding as the ultimate authority the
opinion of a population who may or
may not be informed on the issue at
hand and are easily swayed by the me-
dia is an idea that deserves very careful
scrutiny.
Italy’s latest mistake cost them fif-
teen years of missed progress and is
threatening to collapse the euro; we
must acknowledge, and prepare for the
fact, that vox populi doesn’t equate to
vox dei.
Ladies, please, stop arguing. There’s enough of me to share with you all
