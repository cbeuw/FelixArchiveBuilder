Cost of War on Drugs “fruitless”, argues Imperial
Council Chairman in call for drug reform review
Could we soon be seeing cannabis being put on trial in a battle for legalisation?

Originally made illegal in this
country in 1928 as part of a in-
ternational drive to rid the world
of opium and other such nas-
ties, the legal status of weed in
the Britain depends on where
it is classified under the 1971
Misuse of Drugs Act. Up until
the early part of the last decade,
that was Class B, which comes
with a maximum 5 year jail term
for possession and 14 years for
supply and trafficking. However
in an attempt to free up police
time the government announced
the reclassification of cannabis
to a Class C drug. According to
some reports, 190,000 police
hours were saved the following
year because of the reclassifica-
tion. What didn’t happen, though,
was the complete or even partial
legalisation of Cannabis.
The story resumes with Jacqui
Smith, who announced that weed
was to be reclassified back up to
Class B in 2005. This was amus-
ing in a not particularly funny way
because it was completely and
utterly contrary to what the Ad-
visory Council on the Misuse of
Drugs recommended. Scientists
resigned but the reclassification
carried on as declared. Amster-
dam is notorious in the tourist in-
dustry as the city where you can
easily obtain cannabis. Special
‘coffee shops’ are open with their
drug policy, selling items such
as cannabis-cakes and general
marijuana. In previous years, the
Dutch regulations were divided
between ‘hard’ drugs and ‘soft’
drugs, where cannabis is classed
as a soft drug. The policy on soft
drugs is simply that they can be
taken under ‘personal use’ so
that even smoking weed in pub-
lic is legal. Dutch drug policy is
unique as it is centred on the
idea that every human being may
decide about the matters of its
own health.
Unlucky for some, earlier this
year it was announced that there
will be a change in drug regula-
tions in the Netherlands. The
Dutch government decided that
by the end of 2011, the infamous
cannabis coffee shops will no
longer be open to tourists. In-
stead they will only be open to
Dutch citizens where each cof-
fee shop will act as a private
club of around 1,500 members.
Dutch citizens will need to obtain
a membership for a coffee shop
in order to use it. Additionally,
some coffee shops have been
forced to close due to their prox-
imity to schools.

Baroness Eliza Manningham
Buller is not the only person con-
nected with Imperial to voice con-
cerns about the “War on Drugs”.
Professor David J Nutt, who holds
the Edmond J Safra Chair in Neu-
ropsychopharmacology has long
been an outspoken critic of Brit-
ish drug policy. Last week he
joined Baroness Manningham
Buller and other major public
figures, including Jimmy Carter
and Lech Wałesa, in publishing a
public letter, which appeared as
a full length advertisement in the
national papers, entitled “The
Global War on Drugs has Failed,
It is Time for a New Approach”. In
the letter, they urge governments
to “consider shifting resources
away from criminalising tens of
millions of otherwise law abiding
citizens, and move towards an
approach based on health, harm-
reduction, cost-effectiveness
and respect for human rights”.
Last year Nutt co-authored a
paper in The Lancet which sug-
gested that, taking into account
the harm done to both users and
others, alcohol was more danger-
ous than heroin. The paper also
claimed that “present drug clas-
sification systems have little rela-
tion to the evidence of harm”.
Of course, Nutt is best known
by the general public for having
been removed from his post as
the head of the Advisory Coun-
cil on the Misuse of Drugs after
speaking out against the govern-
ment’s decision to ignore official
advice and reclassify cannabis
from Class B to Class C. Alan
Johnson, the then Home Secre-
tary, wrote to Nutt, saying that he
could not “have public confusion
between scientific advice and
policy”. Shortly after the incident,
however, the Guardian reported
Nutt saying: “All I was trying to do
was help. I wasn’t challenging the
government. We can help them.
We can give them very good ad-
vice, and it would be much more
simpler [sic] if they took that ad-
vice rather than getting tangled
up in other sorts of messages
which frankly really do confuse
the public.”

The History of Legalisation David Nutt advocates new approach
ber of the Centre for Social Justice. In
the speech, she was quoted as saying,
“What I said [about knee-jerk opposi-
tion to any change] has been proved
right.”
“Those politicians and commenta-
tors who may recognise, at the very
least, that there are serious questions
about the efficacy of current policies,
go quiet or retract when faced by the
crude assertion that any other policy
would do corrosive and irreparable
harm.”
Prime Minister David Cameron,
once member of a Home Affairs Se-
lect Committee in May 2002, was
once quoted in the full report, which
examined the Government’s Drugs
Policy at the time: “Drugs policy in
this country has been failing for de-
cades.”
The report continued: “I hope that
our report will encourage fresh think-
ing and a new approach. We need to
get away from entrenched positions
and try to reduce the harm that drugs
do both to users and society at large.”
In her speech, Eliza acknowledged
that “I don’t pretend there are easy
options as this is a complex problem.”
“We need to collect information on
what works, on how harm can be re-
duced and on what is cost-effective.”
Eliza took on her current role as
Council Chairman on July 16 this
year following on from her role as
Deputy Chairman since 2009.

“Given its effect on
us all ... I find it ex-
traordinary that [drug
policy] is not at the
forefront of national
debate.”
