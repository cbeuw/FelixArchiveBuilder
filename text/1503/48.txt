Last weekend saw the Imperial College
Fencing Club Men’s 1st team travel to
Oxford for their first Southern Premier-
ship weekend tournament.An early start
(too early for some) meant leaving the
Union at a time when most people are
still in bed. After picking up a couple of
wayward sabreurs the minibus made its
way up the M40 towards the inhospita-
ble climes of the Oxford cricket school,
where the matches were to be played.
The anticipation was tangible; the
team are current defending champi-
ons of the BUCS competition and had
a reputation to uphold. Unfortunately,
the vagaries of graduation and years
abroad had left them bereft of a couple
of talented epeeists. The new epee team
of Harry Gulliver, John Ashcroft and
Chris Gilliam was as yet untested –
how would they fare? The foil had seen
some changes too, with fresher Glen
Ostacchini making a place for himself
and Indy Leclercq returning from a year
abroad to join Ed Collier and Chris.
Sabre remained unchanged, thankfully,
and the team knew they could count on
captain Didier Nohlmans, Henry Gann
and Maiyuran Ratneswaran to crush the
opposing teams.
IC’s first match was against ULU,
who turned out to be a shadow of their
former selves. Lacking some key fenc-
ers, their second place in the league last
year seemed a long way away as first
the sabreurs, then the foilists and finally
the epeeists came away with comfort-
able victories. Final score: 135-74 to
Imperial.
The fencers knew, however, that the
real challenge was yet to come, with
Cambridge, Bristol and Oxford all hav-
ing turned up with strong teams. Cam-
bridge were next, and having won the
toss Imperial determined the order of
fencing: sabre, foil and epee for last.
The sabre ended up being a relatively

comfortable victory, although lapses
of concentration towards the end of
the match cost them some silly points.
Imperial went into the foil with an al-
most twenty point lead. Some strong
opposition from Cambridge, along with
some harsh refereeing by one of their
fencers, meant Imperial lost the foil by
a few points to go into the epee with a
sixteen-point cushion. This meant that
the epeeists had to score at least thirty
points for IC to put the match away. Do-
ing their best to hold things up, the boys
in white nevertheless started dropping
points here and there, and at one point
came very close to losing the overall
lead. Coming into the final bout, Harry
was but two points ahead overall. He
produced a blistering performance to
hit the magic number of points and even
won his match in the process, meaning
that Imperial came away with a seven-
point victory, 114-107. As the team
split up for the night, the designated BK
MVP of the day was duly deemed to be
Harry.
The following morning saw a 9am
start versus Bristol in the cold cricket
school. While there was reason to be
cautious, as Bristol have always been
a strong team (carried by their star
foilist), the consensus was that they
were beatable. Foil started the match,
doing very well to come out with a slim
deficit after the match – considering the
strength of the Bristol foilists). The sa-
breurs then did their thing and re-estab-
lished a strong lead, Henry in particular
producing a strong performance to walk
all over the Bristol fencers.
