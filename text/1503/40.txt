Researchers declare proverb ‘misguiding statement’
T
hree PhD students in the
Department of Physics
recently undertook a proj-
ect with two Biomedical
Scientists to see whether
the proverb ‘People in Glass Houses
shouldn’t throw stones’ was a well-
founded piece of advice.
Building two rooms, one com-
pletely of glass, the other com-
pletely of concrete, a total of 200
participants were asked to throw 16
stones in any direction they pleased.
CT scans were taken before and af-
ter the activity and compared using
a new piece of modeling software.
“There were no significant dif-
ferences between the participants
in the glass house and the concrete
house,” Prof Languette, the lead re-
searcher, declared. “One subject in
the glass house did lose a finger,
If the Biology department refuses to agree to engineer the leopard,
researchers may need to resort to Photoshop.
however we deemed this an anom-
aly and as such can conclude this
proverb is misleading.”
The experiment was largely suc-
cessful, apart from one incident in-
volving a pneumatic drill and frus-
tration that the concrete house was
invulnerable; measurements were
terminated once participants in re-
spective houses began talking to
imaginary cameras voting to evict
one another.
Many have criticised the decision
to fund this research as unnecessary,
but the study has been welcomed by
the Asperger Syndrome Foundation,
as the potential inaccuracy of such
proverbs has allegedly been the
source of chronic sleepness nights
among the pedantic end of the autis-
tic spectrum. However, critics have
been quick to point out that these

cases of insomnia are, much like
many cases of Asperger Syndrome,
self-diagnosed.
The team are planning to proceed
with more experiments in this field
and are planning to genetically com-
bine chameleon DNA with that of a
leopard’s to see whether the modi-
fication makes the creature change
its spots.
Negotiation with the Biology de-
partment will be necessary: in ex-
change for genetic engineering,
they are expected to ask for access
to MAGPIE, which is capable of
generating up to 26 million amps.
In an interview with the head of Bi-
ology about his department’s plans
for the machine, he told the Turnip:
“We’re not actually going to use
it for any research. We just have a
score to settle against Chemistry.”
Worried that you may be the sort of person
that people see and think “hey, I wouldn’t
mind knowing that guy/girl”? Never fear,
here is your guide to being a massive dick-
head in the Library cafe:
1. Walk around in your school hoodie with
a hilarious nickname like “THE MUFF-
MEISTER”. So people know you get all
the bitches and are A FUCKING LAD.
Not enough for you? Go to 2
2. Don’t have a hoodie like that as you
weren’t popular enough at school to get a
nickname? Just wear one of those “comi-
cal” t-shirts, like the one pictured. I bet
every time you wear that to the Union
you have to just keep
your head down
as all the girls
just swoon.
Even though the
joke was never funny
in the first place, you
will look like a true
comedy genius.
3. Don’t drink the coffee in the library.
Only bring in Starbucks, or other branded,
coffee. Loudly shout that you “cannot be-
lieve that people actually drink
that shit they call coffee here”.
4. For extra points, drink only
coffee from independent cof-
fee shops, telling everyone
“Starbucks is sooooo generic”.
5. When putting sugar and milk in your
drink stand in front of the dispensers. Take
as much time as possible. If someone tries
to go around you to get sugar, slap their
hands away and tell them to be polite. The
rude fuckers.
6. Poison the sugar sachets with crys-
tal meth. This doesn’t make you
look like a twat,
it’ll just make the li-
brary more fun. That’s
not sugar cane.
7. Sit in a booth on your
own and use the computer. Log into Face-
book and go onto chat. Make sure to talk
to someone and laugh when you send or
receive a message. Then everyone will
envy your amazing conversation.
8. Talk loudly about how much work
you have. Make sure everyone knows
it’s more work than they have as your
degree is better than theirs, and by exten-
sion you are a better specimen of human-
ity than they are. Or, you’re just insecure
about your degree.
9. Tell everyone about how you’re hun-
gover as you drink a lot, and that you’re
in the library as you never do work. Then
people will know you are a true badman
who has managed to get through an
Imperial degree without doing any
work. WOW.You must be a genius!
Or a liar.

This isn’t a picture of the library? You’ve tricked me with your picture.
Why are you doing this to me. Stop making me read picture captions.
An apology from
Hangman
Hangman would like to apolagise to
all the readers of Felix, and not just
for that spelling error. Over the past
few weeks, we have done, and said,
some things that we are not proud of.
Hangman recently read a story
in The Daily Mail about two LSE
students who wrote a very offensive
Agony Uncle column. They suggested
that a student should rape and beat
his girlfriend. It seemed to cause
some outrage.
After reading this, we had an
epiphany. We realised that what we
had been doing was wrong. We would
therefore like to apologise for not be-
ing offensive enough to provoke such
a reaction. We hang our heads in
shame and will, in future, aim to be
as offensive and vulgar as possible,
where applicable.
We have never aimed to not be of-
fensive. It seems that, lately, like a
plane piloted by a newly trained Mus-
lim pilot, we have landed safely on the
non-offensive runway with no fuss, I
hope you racist shitbags didn’t think
that was going somewhere else? If
you did, come write for us.
