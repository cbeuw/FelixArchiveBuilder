Fencing: promising weekend

As before, the outcome of the match
was to be decided in the epee; as be-
fore, it was a nerve-wracking affair. The
epeeists started out with an 11-point
lead which they had to maintain to win
the match. As it went on, though, Bris-
tol asserted their dominance and the
Imperial fencers saw their lead shrink.
Once again it came down to Harry, an-
choring epee, to win his match against
Matt Billing, Bristol’s best fencer, to
be able to win the match overall. Both
sides were feverishly tallying the scores
to figure out when the match would be
put beyond doubt. Unfortunately for
Bristol, they were doing the sums a bit
too feverishly and got them wrong (or,
according to them, ‘misread the score
sheet’) – meaning that when the final
three minutes were up, both sides start-
ed cheering, to mutual bewilderment. In
the end, though a team with two physi-
cists and a mathematician were always
going to get it right and IC came off
with a one point victory, 101-100.
The final match against Oxford was
to prove a clash of titans, as both teams
had won all their matches and had been
on form all weekend. Having lost the
toss, sabre went first, producing a com-
prehensive win to put Imperial almost
thirty points ahead. The foilists then
went ahead to try and put the match be-
yond reach; however what started off as
a closely-fought match crumbled into a
ten-point win for Oxford. It was up to
the epeeists to save the day. In the most
nerve-wracking moment of the week-
end, they had to reach twenty-seven
hits to be able to claim victory for the
team…but it was not to be. The final
score was an agonisingly close 45-26
to Oxford, meaning the two teams were
perfectly tied, 98-98. The fact that Ox-
ford won two weapons, though, meant
that victory was theirs, and a dejected
Imperial team made their way back
down to London.
Overall, the weekend was a positive
result, though, and the the motivation to
win everything at the next premiership
weekend is greater than ever.
On Saturday, the Imperial Eagles set out
to play their first competitive match in
the Development League. The planned
opening game betweenBy now, several
changes to the league schedule were un-
dertaken after Olympia II pulled out of
the division, which meant that instead
of facing the Ruislip Eagles II, Imperial
had to face the Newham Flames, who
were often praised for their extensive
youth development and link to the GB
U16 squad, where some of their players
receive very extensive training - or so
we thought.
During the warm up period, the lack
of skill and variation in the admittedly
very young teams game was becoming
more and more obvious and they failed
to surprise a well-trained Eagles site in
decent form.
The Flames showed great spirit and
never stopped fighting for what would
have been their first ever competitive
victory, but, despite catching the Eagles’
defense off guard on several occasions,
failed to match the scoring and goal-
keeping abilities of their very handsome
opponents.
Newham tried to move the ball fast in
attack, but could not exert much pres-
sure on IC team, unless their physi-
cally intimidating centre-back set out
to storm towards the 6-metre line, with
which he was successful on a few oc-
casions. Neither of their wingers was
able to stretch the game and create
space for an over-motivated pivot,
which narrowed their attack down to
their berserker and a marfanoid-looking
left-back, who despite of his impressive
height of over 2m, was unable to make
a real impression on Imperials veteran
goalkeeper, Stefan Bauer, who is slowly
rediscovering his true form after a good
pre-season and managed to save an im-
pressive 3 penalties in a row.
In attack, the Imperial Eagles were
lacking the patience to play well renown
schemes like “Wurst” and “Heidi”,
leading to some hasty and unsuccessful
shots. However, superior counter-at-
tacks and some individual skills meant
that Newham would concede 29 goals
by the end of the 60 minutes.
At this point, it is important to point
out that our president, Kolja Ortmann,
scored a counter attack, which should
be an indicator of the level of resistance
Imperial had to face.
All in all, this game was a good way
to ease players back into the routine
of the Development League before IC
is set to face stronger opponents, such
as Great Dane II, Ruislip Eagles II and
arch enemies UCL, who have yet to beat
Imperial in a league match.
However, considering that some of
the Newham Flames’ players are hailed
as Engalnds Handball hope, everyone
would have hoped for a more challeng-
ing game.
