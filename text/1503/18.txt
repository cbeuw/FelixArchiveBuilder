ever such an interesting
piece on the Occupy pro-
tests the other week. You
remember? It was the
one that kept using the word socialist to
describe a bunch of people expressing
an opinion. You don’t remember. That’s
alright, it’s not really necessary for what
I’m going to say anyway. Let’s begin
with the Occupy protests, and leave
George to one side for a while.
The Occupy protests are interesting.
I’ve long since stopped reading Internet
news-wheel Reddit thanks to an increas-
ing torrent of people using it to post
opinions they know others will slav-
ishly massage back at them, and a lot of
this came down to posts about the Oc-
cupy protests. The protests were right,
Reddit said. Everyone else was wrong,
Reddit said. That was that. It’s a special
brand of single-mindedness, which, to
me, almost always indicates someone
who has not really thought through what
they are doing.
Despite this, the Occupy protests
have interesting points. If you go to the
homepage of Occupy London Stock
Exchange and look at their public state-
ment, the first point is simple and con-
cise, and mostly apolitical. It’s a simple
statement of opinion, and it reads: “The
current system is unsustainable.” These
people are protesting because they be-
lieve the people who have the capacity
to change the current system are also
the people who stand to lose least from

the way the system is currently running.
That is not the statement of a socialist.
That is the statement of someone who
has a concern about the way a govern-
ment is being run.
Socialism is a talk for another day, but
– and George, you can come back now,
thanks for waiting – whenever it is to be
used in conversation it cannot be used
as a vague cudgel with which to smack
around arguments. You don’t have to be
socialist to object to government action.
You merely have to have an opinion,
and a voice.
I don’t think people have to stay out
in the cold at night to make use of their
voice (incidentally, the thermal-scan-
ning of the tents was debunked a few
days later as fraudulent), and I don’t
think people have to be nice, clean,
well-dressed and well-behaved people
in order to be allowed to hold an opin-
ion. If we were allowed to expel people
from society for the way they looked
then I’d have exiled any and all people
who decided a white shirt under a jump-
er looked ‘trendy’ at the start of the cen-
tury. But that doesn’t make the people
who wear those shirt/jumper combos
less justified in holding an opinion. It
just makes them look like a sixth-form
student who recently discovered Marks
and Spencer.
George’s article is troubling. Like
many people who hold views similar
to him, George is interested in attack-
ing the people behind the protests, their
ways of life, their standards of living,
A
couple of weeks ago, I had
an interesting discussion in
the kitchen in my hall about
a quite exotic topic. I want-
ed to share my ‘insights’
into the issue with you and maybe give
a helping hand to those of you struggling
with this peculiar question. The question
is: “How would you kill yourself?”
Now, don’t get me wrong, I don’t have
any desire to do so, and neither did any-
body who participated in that discussion
(I hope). But this is the kind of topic you
come up with if you’ve worn out the
question “how was your day?”, which,
if we are honest, just deeply annoys us.
I mean, seriously, if you ask that question
to somebody, it is just to make conversa-
tion. On most occasions you don’t even
listen to their answer. And since most
people at Imperial study all day long,
even when I occasionally listen to other
people telling me how shit their day was,
the only thing I get out of it is that I’m not
the only one feeling likeAmy Winehouse
sober – and we all know how that one
ended, right?!
So here we are again, back on to the
question I asked earlier. Would you just
drink yourself to death like somebody
famous whom I don’t have the balls to
mention here, or would you take poison
and fall asleep? Would you throw your-
self off a bridge or a tall building, or
would you rather cut your arteries open?
Would you throw yourself in front of a
train, or would you hang yourself fixed to
the ceiling of the men’s room?
All of these methods have been proven
to be successful, with some more ef-
fective than others. Personally, I would
never throw myself in front of a train be-
cause you create a) emotional trauma for
the train conductor and b) a major delay
for all the people in the train. No, if I go,
I want to leave no mess behind and no
major inconvenience. I also don’t want
anybody to be traumatised for the rest of
their life after finding me.
So what remains: drugs? Yeah, that
would be an option, although I have to
say that I don’t like the thought of that
brief period of helplessness between tak-
ing the pills (or whatever form of drug I
am using) and death. The idea of waiting
for death to come sounds like hell to me.
Throw yourself off a building? A bridge?
The building is not an option because I
could fall on somebody, accidentally
bringing harm to others, when really I
was only trying to end my own miserable
existence. The bridge would be better be-
cause any major obstacle could be spot-
ted in advance and if I fall on a seagull,
I pretty much don’t give a shit. My prob-
lem with that solution is that I don’t trust
all these guys that say “water becomes as
hard as concrete after 15 meters”, maybe
because I’ve seen too many C-class mov-
ies where guys survive 100 metre falls
out of hovering helicopters.
Well, this leaves us with two viable op-
tions: to cut your arteries open or to hang
yourself, preferably in a bath tub/men’s
room (or girl’s room, I don’t want to dis-
their worth as people – instead of look-
ing at the reasons for their protests, and
discussing those issues properly. This
isn’t troubling because it’s poor journal-
ism – that would be rich coming from
the man who wrote six hundred words
comparing porridge to atheism. It’s
troubling because Imperial, unlike other
places where such matters might be dis-
cussed by people our age, actually con-
tains many of the people who will go on
to make up the 1% in decades to come.
While I joke on an almost weekly ba-
sis about my reasons for despising all of
you, the truth is that there are moments
of genuine disgust as I read Twitter, Fe-
lix or listen in to conversations in the
JCR. Many of you aren’t just humour-
ously dislikeable. You’re worryingly
single-minded. That goes for both sides
of the political spectrum, whether you
cry socialists when people express opin-
ions that differ from yours, or cheer on
the Occupy protests as evidence that
the Government was out to get you all
along. If you think the answer to any of
our future problems lies in just the one
ideological textbook, then you’re going
to do more harm than good.
Think I’m wrong about the Occupy
protests? Do you think the shirt/jumper
combination helps you score with the
ladies? Feed me your wrong opinions
at: anangrygeek@gmail.com
criminate against anybody) so it’s easier
for others to clean. I know, it is not ideal,
mainly because the person that’s going
to find me is going to be quite shocked.
That’s why I would call the cops and tell
them that I heard a noise in my room and
that I think that somebody broke in. Of
course, I would leave a letter on the floor
apologising for the inconvenience since,
although they are cops, they don’t see
dead people every day like Haley Joel
Osment in The Sixth Sense. The only
question that remains is: what is worse?
Finding somebody hanging from the
ceiling looking down at you with a pale,
white face of death? Or seeing somebody
submerged in a bath tub full of blood?
As you can tell, this discussion has
gotten both rather detailed and a little
disgusting. And with an inexhaustible
amount of ways to end your own life, it
is a discussion that could last for a very
long time. So, maybe, after all, it is best
to stick with a simple “How was your
day?”...
Some people just can’t do anything right...
