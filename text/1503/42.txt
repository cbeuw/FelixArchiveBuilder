SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots.
The numbers in each square in-
dicate how many edges of the
square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting
a week to see the solution will
also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, as the
puzzles team recieves one false
promise per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
TARGET: 18
