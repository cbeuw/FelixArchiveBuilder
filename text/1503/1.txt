The Council Chairman of Imperial
College, Baroness Eliza Manning-
ham-Buller, has called on the govern-
ment to reconsider its current drugs
policy following the ongoing expense
of the “War on Drugs”. Speaking at
a meeting held by the All Party Par-
liamentary Group on Drug Policy
Reform, the ex-Director General of
MI5 and crossbench life peer raised
potential points of consideration in a
speech, including regulation of can-
nabis and a focus on drugs as an issue
of health rather than of crime.
Stating her awareness that the is-
sue is a “minefield” and that potential
misrepresentation by the media was
likely, Eliza acknowledged that drug
policy is a “taboo subject for discus-
sion”, while criticising “knee-jerk re-
action to any change”. Eliza went on
to state that her surprise at the lack of
discussion: “Given its effect on us all
and the enormous cost of our efforts
to limit the problems which drugs
cause, I find it extraordinary that it
is not at the forefront of national de-
bate.”
Eliza continued with a dismissal
of the “same well-worn policy” uti-
lised by the government for the past
50 years, following the aim of a 1961
UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs
to create a drug-free world: “We are
unlikely to address the harm that is
being caused to the world unless we
accept, as the US Senate recently did,
that much, though not all, of the vast
expenditure on the so-called “War on
Drugs” has been fruitless.”
In discussion with Felix, Eliza re-
stated her aim to “reduce the harm
that drugs do” following the recog-
nition of “extensive human misery”
caused by the illegal drugs trade.
Eliza also criticised a response to
the speech which labelled the call to
review current policy as ‘waving the
white flag’, as described by a mem-
