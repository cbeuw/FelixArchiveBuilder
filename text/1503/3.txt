Students and staff affiliated with Mem-
bers of Cambridge Defend Education
have been staging a sit-in protest in a
university lecture theatre at University
of Cambridge since Wednesday 23 No-
vember.
Protestors took over the lecture the-
atre as Universities Minister David
Willetts was about to give a talk on
The Idea of The University. The talk
was intended to form part of the wider
lecture series being delivered by the
Centre for Research in the Arts, Social
Sciences and Humanities’.
Students were protesting against the
plan to increase the cap on tuition fees
in England to £9,000 a year and to
withdraw public funding for university
teaching budgets for many subjects.

Student occupations return in force
James Robinson, an English gradu-
ate from Corpus Christi, stated: “We
have all heard Mr Willetts’ idea of a
university but we wanted to share
ours, and also lend our support to next
Wednesday’s public sector strikes, oth-
er occupation protests across Europe,
and protests against the Government’s
White Paper on universities.”
Further occupations have been re-
ported at universities across the UK.
Students have occupied part of the
University of Birmingham in a protest
that is also over a planned increase in
tuition fees and education cuts.
Birmingham University said in a
statement: “Students and staff have the
right to protest peacefully but the safe-
ty of students and staff must remain
our priority.”
Up to 100 students have taken part
in a protest at the University of War-
wick. University spokesman Peter
Dunn said he was not concerned by the
occupation, organised by the Nation-
al Campaign Against Fees and Cuts
(NCAFC), stating: “We’ve had occu-
pations before. This is another one and
I’m sure we’ll have occupations in the
future.”
The latest call to occupy universities
across the country comes approximate-
ly one year after sit-ins at the Univer-
sity of Manchester and the University
of Sussex. Students occupied a build-

University of Sussex in Brighton occu-

proposed plans to cut 115 jobs and cre-

Organiser for the NCAFC Michael
Chessum posted a statement on the
NCAFC website “Nothing could be
clearer from the past year of struggle
than the ability of clear political de-
mands to mobilise numbers in the
streets. If the student movement can
spell out and fight for a genuine ideo-
logical alternative to fees, debt and
marketisation in education, it may well
be closer to winning than many pre-
sume.”
Life at Imperial continued as per
usual.
“We’ve had occupa-
tions before. This
is another one and
I’m sure we will have
occupations in the
future.”
“[The student move-
ment in the UK] may
well be closer to
winning than many
presume.”
