Gospel Choir has the X Factor
If you were watching ITV closely this
Saturday evening you may have seen
some familiar faces. Members of the
Imperial College Gospel Choir (ICGC)
were featured giving it their all, with
their best clicks, jazz hands and on Sat-
urday evening’s live edition of The X
Factor.
15 members of ICGC and 25 mem-
bers of King’s College Gospel Choir
were recruited to perform with Mar-
cus Collins, one of the X Factor con-
testants, in his number of the week
‘Higher and Higher’, (originally sung
by Jackie Wilson). The performance
was crowned the “performance of
the night” by Gary Barlow, and Kelly
Rowland commented on the energy of
the act which could be credited in some
respect to the enthusiasm of the choir.
Six girls from the joint Imperial/King’s
College choir were also selected to fea-
ture in Amelia Lily’s performance of
the Aretha Franklin song ‘Think’.
One of the X Factor producers com-
mented after the show that the choir
was, “The best choir we’ve ever had.”
This then led to half the choir sponta-
neously bursting into tears and wild
screeches that almost brought down
their porter-cabin dressing room.
The gospel choirs were selected for
the show as a result of their involve-
ment in July’s University Gospel Choir
of the Year competition, in which both
ICGC and King’s College were final-
ists. In true showbiz fashion the news
of the upcoming appearance was very
last minute. Members of the choir
learnt of their potential TV debut at
lunch time on Thursday, and confirma-
tion that they had a place on the show
was only received on Friday morning.
The choir spent all day Saturday at
the ITV studios in Wembley Park,
where they were taught their routine
by the show’s choreographers. The rest
of the day was spent rehearsing… and
discreetly stalking various members
of the X Factor team. As evidence on
Facebook shows, this was very produc-
tive.
Saturday has brought welcome pub-
licity for a thriving and fast growing
Imperial society. Christina Crossette-
Thambiah, President of ICGC com-
mented that she “never could have
dreamed something like this could
have happened to ICGC”. Chris Far-
rell, one of the original members of the
choir when it was founded six years
ago, said he remembered when the
choir was only “ten people gathered
round a piano”.
With rumours of the joint choir be-
ing called back for the X Factor final,
staged live at Wembley Arena on De-
cember 11, the sky is the limit and ev-
eryone involved is excited about what
is to come. However, the choir can be
seen in action a little closer to home at
their Christmas concert at Holy Trin-
ity church on Prince Consort Road
on December 13; tickets are available
through the Union website.
