W
hen a friend came
from home to visit
me this weekend,
the Occupy protest
at St Paul’s Cathe-
dral was an obvious stop on the tourist
trail. Whether you agree with the protes-
tors or not, the creation of a functioning
tent civilisation with its own library,
media centre and even a ‘university’ is
really quite impressive. But you don’t
need to see what they’ve done to the
City of London landscape to see the im-
pact they’ve had on the political arena
– our economy and society are under the
microscope like never before in our gen-
eration. And as the long suffering Felix
Comment editors know only too well,
the debate has been raging fiercely in
these pages.
The Occupy legitimacy debate has
beengoingonformorethanlongenough.
But one thing that has come out of it,
and other related pieces in this paper, is
the prevalence of a certain view among
some students in this college. This isn’t
a question of the standard right/left di-
vide – there are perfectly sensible peo-
ple and arguments on either side – it’s
a question of attitude, of outlook. Your
political opinions should be formed by
an honest look at the world around you
and by thinking how best it should, and
realistically can, be organised. But in ad-
dressing the issue of poverty and why it
exists, certain commenters have instead
Rory Fenton
Poverty should occupy your mind
chosen to justify and defend their own
social positions at all cost, as a default,
regardless of the consequences and self-
delusions involved.
Without naming names, we were here
told that poverty is “the appalling situa-
tion that ten abysmal years of serially in-
competent socialist Labour government
has created”. Which is curious, because
I recall poverty existing before 1997.
But more fundamentally this betrays an
instinct to blame first and think later, if
at all. The world is simply more compli-
cated than that.
Most of us, myself included, have
very little experience of what it is like to
live below the poverty line in the UK. I
have always wanted to believe that you
can achieve anything if you work hard
enough at it, and in my own life I have
found this to be fairly true. And surely
if you work hard you should enjoy the
fruits of that labour? Bankers work
bloody hard and get duly compensated
for it. The problem is this: they aren’t
the only ones working hard. Few Im-
perial students will have to know what
it is to wake up early to take the bus to
work because you can’t afford the tube.
Surely that too is hard work. Few of us
will know what it is to go to a school
where we are branded collectively as
failures, where we are only ever ex-
pected to achieve a few GCSE passes
and feel the overwhelming pressure to
simply comply. For most of us, the road
to success has been clear and defined –
we go to good schools, get spoon fed our
A Levels and get into a great university.
Of course this takes hard work along the
way but it is a clear and well-trodden
path. Just how open is this path to the
14 year old in a failing comprehensive?
That 38% of students here were private-
ly educated should give you some idea.
To be poor is to face challenges be-
yond what most of us are used to. To rise
above them is laudable but it is all too
rare. There are undoubtedly lazy people
in this world who earn very little and
hard working people who earn a great
deal but to infer that those who are poor
must therefore deserve it is a failure of
understanding.
Poverty is a complex issue with no
easy solution. But simply laying the
blame at the feet of feckless individu-
als and an overgenerous government is
unhelpful, lazy and cruel. Where exactly
poverty’s “solution” will come from is
still a subject of much debate, although
it’s clear that it won’t necessarily come
from the left (New Labour showed pret-
ty well that simply throwing money at
poverty won’t make it go away). But un-
til we face up to the realities of the chal-
lenges faced by the poor in this country,
no meaningful debate can be had.
