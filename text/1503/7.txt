Organisation recommended guidelines
are not. Currently, only 37% of people
in need of treatment in sub-Saharan
Africa actually receive it despite one
of the Millennium Development Goals
being universal access to treatment for
HIV/AIDS for all by 2010. Treatment
regimens in these settings are limited.
There is a continuing issue with resis-
tance to the antiretrovirals and the need
for second line drugs in these cases
complicates regimens further and steep-
ly increases the price of antiretrovirals.
We’re a long way off coverage for the
most in need; expanding drug access to
those who aren’t even sick looks like a
distant dream when faced with the real-
ity of these facts. If the current cut of
the pie that goes to AIDS isn’t enough
to fund treatment for those in need per-
haps there should be more money going
to AIDS treatment and, if this is the best
prevention measure available to stop
the spread of this virus, we should be
whole heartedly pushing for an increase
in funding for treatment as prevention.
Asking the cynical questions, howev-
F
or anyone who has an in-
terest in the global AIDS
pandemic and the preven-
tion strategies underway
to counter it, this summer
proved to be a very exciting one. The
results from a ground breaking inter-
national HIV prevention study prov-
ing the practical elimination of sexual
transmission of HIV through the effec-
tive treatment of those infected with
antiretroviral therapy were released
this July and sent the AIDS community
a tweet with possibilities. Shortly after,
The Economist published a title of ‘The
End of AIDS?’ as its cover feature. Af-
ter 30 years of searching for a solution
the hopes of many in seeing the end of
this devastating infection have been
revived. The only issue is that the idea
of treatment as prevention is costly.
In fact, it’s the most costly prevention
intervention ever seriously considered
for HIV. A total of $6.9bn was given in
international assistance to HIV/AIDS
in 2010 – that represents almost 10%
of total foreign aid given from govern-
ments to assist less fortunate countries
for last year – that’s a large slice of
the aid pie for one disease. So, should
we really be demanding an increase
in funding for this latest ‘elimination’
strategy?
Antiretroviral therapy or ART is the
treatment given to HIV positive peo-
ple at risk of immunocompromise to
prevent the development of AIDS dis-
eases. It works by preventing replica-
tion of the HIV virus in the body and
therefore reducing the levels of the vi-
rus and its destruction of immune cells.
This also reduces the infectiousness of
an HIV positive person and their risk of
transmitting the virus on to others and
this is the basic premise in treatment as
prevention. For a few years now there
has been an excitement bubbling below
the surface amongst those working in
HIV/AIDS. There have been models
put forward by hopeful souls foreseeing
the end of the epidemic in sub-Saharan
Africa within half a century and reports
from across the world including Spain,
Taiwan and Canada claiming reduc-
tions in HIV infection rates since the
widespread use of ART, but it wasn’t
until Myron Cohen and his team at the
HIV prevention trials network conduct-
ed a study which showed a 96% reduc-
tion in HIV transmission that people re-
ally began to take the idea of treatment
as prevention seriously.
On the face of it, the idea of increas-
ing funding for treatment seems to be
perfectly plausible and morally justifi-
able. Treating people who are HIV pos-
itive earlier in their infection isn’t such
a huge leap from a clinical perspective
as evidence shows that it’s likely to
prolong their life. If this also practical-
ly eliminates the risk of onwards trans-
mission onto sexual partners that is a
massive bonus and makes it well worth
the increase in investment. The prob-
lem is many of those around the world
who are HIV positive and should be re-
ceiving treatment under World Health
er, is important when dealing with the
issue of AIDS funding and one of the
cynical questions here is exactly who is
it benefiting from this funding for treat-
ment? There is no doubt that treatment
is good for the patient and it now ap-
pears to be good from a public health
perspective as well, if it reduces trans-
mission, but it’s also very good for re-
search institutions and drug companies.
Expanding treatment to all those who
are HIV positive means more invest-
ment in antiretroviral therapy develop-
ment and much more money going to
drug companies, the majority of whom
are based in the high income countries
that are kindly ‘donating’ all this mon-
ey to prevent HIV/AIDS in the poorest
countries in the world.
Whatever happened to those other in-
terventions to prevent HIV? The origi-
nal HIV prevention messages promot-
ing abstinence, consistent and correct
condom use and remaining faithful to
your sexual partners seem to have been
drowned out by the excited screams of
the treatment as prevention advocates.
Many rightly argue that these messages
have failed in greatly reducing rates of
HIV infection but the fact is that con-
doms are almost 100% efficacious in
stopping the transmission of HIV and
aren’t anywhere near as expensive as
a lifelong course of antiretrovirals.
Can’t we persevere with these tools to
tackle this disease instead of increasing
funding at the expense of other causes?
And these other causes are important.
It is a sad fact in international aid, that
funding for a cause is dependent on
how conscious people are of it and not
necessarily how worthy the cause is.
The Schistosomiasis Control initiative
(SCI) is an Imperial-based initative
which treats Neglected Tropical Dis-
eases or NTDs (so called because few
people are aware of the impact they
have on the very poorest in the world)
in several countries in Africa. These
devastating diseases result in huge
amounts of long-term morbidity and
mortality but are relatively unheard
of. Treatment to cure a group of 7 of
these infections, including Schistoso-
miasis, costs just 50p per person annu-
ally. 200 million of the most impover-
ished people in Africa are infected with
Schistosomiasis and despite how easy
and cost-effective it is to treat this and
other NTDs they receive a fraction of
the aid funding given to HIV/AIDS
simply because they don’t grab the
headlines and move people to activism
in the same way.
Perhaps the real issue with AIDS
funding isn’t necessarily the amount
that goes to it but the highly directive
way in which aid to countries must be
spent. Aid for AIDS comes in a variety
of forms but primarily bilaterally, from
one government to another, or multi-
laterally through organisations such
as the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria. The money
received by national governments must
go directly to funding HIV/AIDS pro-
grammes in the country with no scope
for reallocation of these resources to
other causes such as NTDs or wider
healthcare needs. These other causes
are all at least as worthy of investments
as HIV/AIDS and some would argue,
due to the number of people they af-
fect, more worthy and in need of great-
er investment. Governments should be
granted greater flexibility in the way
they allocate aid resources and this can
be achieved with the adequate checks
in place to ensure it goes to the good
of the population at large, whether this
is investing in HIV/AIDS or other pro-
grammes.
Perhaps it is not be a question over
how the aid pie is cut but more a ques-
tion of how big the pie is. If current aid
levels aren’t enough to ensure treat-
ment for those in need of it be it for
HIV or NTDs surely the solution isn’t
greater funding for one or the other but
greater funding overall. Convincing
governments of high income countries
to increase overall aid funding at this
time is, however, in itself a whole new
challenge and a different aid debate.
