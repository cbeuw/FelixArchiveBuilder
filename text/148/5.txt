FELIX 5
S O C C E R
On the f i r s t Wednesday and Saturday aft-
ernoons of term the College Soccer
t r i a l s mare held at Harlington.About
70 freshers attended,and I should l i k e
to take t h i s opportunity of -welcoming
them to the Club.The standard of f o o t -
b a l l amongst the freshers appeared to
be high,and as a large number of l a s t
years' players are s t i l l i n College,I
think we can look forward to another en-
joyable and successful season,It i s i n -
evitable,however,that i t w i l l taKe one
or two weeks before the teams s e t t l e
down,and freshers should not become too
impatient i f i n i t i a l l y they f i n d they
are playing i n a team whose f o o t b a l l
r e a l l y does not s u i t t h e i r own a b i l i t y .
It i s hoped,as f o r l a s t season,
to run seven teams.As w e l l as matches
in the London University Leagues many
f r i e n d l y matches have been arranged so
that most people w i l l be playing i n two
matches each week.Trips to Swansea,Ox-
f o r d , Cambridge, Southampton.etc. have
been arranged and i t i s hoped that each
team w i l l make at least one t r i p during
the session.
This season i a p a r t i c u l a r l y im-
portant i n as much as we hope to com-
plete a hat-trick of London University
Cup P i n a l winoVIn the 1959 and I960 Cup
Finals.,respectively,Kings! and G o l d -
smiths were beaten and t h i s session we
must again start as favourites.Nine of
l a s t year's winning side are s t i l l i n
College.
The C o l l s g * Cliib has, in the- paarft,
supplied a large number of players to
the University XI's,and i t i s probable
thatthis t r a d i t i o n w i l l be continued'.
B a s i l Jamea,the Welsh Amateur toternaÂ»W-
ional,has again been elected captain,
while C o l i n Caseraore i s f i x t u r e s secret-
ary.
I was sorry t o see John Ereece
walking about' College with his arm i n a
s l i n g . I hope John makes a speedy recov-
ery,and that we w i l l see him i n action
again a f t e r Christmas.
Fixture cards are now a v a i l a b l e
and can be obtained from o f f i c i a l s of
the Club.Training sessions are held on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12.30 p.m..
F i n a l l y I should l i k e to remind every-
one to t i c k t h e i r names o f f on the team
sheets as early as possible.
C R O S S C O U N T R Y
At the Freshers reception,twenty fres-
hers sighed on for the club. On Wednesday
5th October,ten of these accompanied byaa
similar number of old lags,went to Peter-
sham for a training run. Although this
run was officially not competitive,two
freshers,led Wilkina and John Young,show-
ad excellent form.
Despite the absence of captain Jim Ber-
nard, I.C.runners were' very much to the
fore i n the UL "trials held over 65 miles
at Parliament H i l l Fields on Saturday 8th
October, John Collins and John Cleator
finished 6th and 7th, while Fete Warren
was 9th. The last named followed by Sod
Wilkina,Dave Hammonds and John Young.
Ted Wilkins and John Young were the only
freshmen from any oollege to he placed, in
$he f i r s t twenty.
J U D O
Last year the Club had a most im-
-pressive season, bringing o f f several
rather s u r p r i s i n g -victories. Perhaps
the most pleasing r e s u l t of the season
was a win over a rather large and hefty
Met. P o l i c e team a f t e r some vigorous
and s p i r i t e d f i g h t i n g .
Wo are hoping t o have a f a i r l y
extensive programme of matches again
t h i s year and I would once again l i k e
to appeal to members of I.C. t o allow
the p o l i c e team to come safely t o the
gym. as we would l i k e to have a bash
at them f i r s t .
Last year the Club had three members,
J.Sheperd, M.Butler, and N.Ramsbottom who
fought r e g u l a r l y f o r the University team
and represented the combined South East
England U n i v e s i t i e s team. John Sheperd
also fought h i s way i n t o the English team
and i s now reserve t o the Great B r i t a i n
team.
This term we are holding a course f o r
beginners on Wednesday evenings i n which
we are hoping t o teach the a r t of break-
- f a l l i n g and some of the b a s i c throws of
judo. Why not come along and be secure
in the knowledge that you w i l l be able t o
defend yourself wherever you go, when-
e v e r you are f i t to go out.
