On rhursday,6th October, twenty memb-
ers of the AGO assembled in the Snack bar
and the chairman,Mr,P.Davies,opened the
meeting with- characteristic efficiency
at about 5-30 pm. The minutes of the l a s t
meeting were read and passed as atrue and
correct record,there being no alternative,
since of the assembled company only the
Chairman and the two secretaries had been
at the last meeting.
Under t!ie "matters arising",Mr,MacCrae
asked i f the fence which the hockey club
had asked f o r had been ereoted.The Chair-
man replied in the negative,but s a i d that
as an alternative the grass had been a l l -
owed to grow and he hoped this would pro-
vide a suitable solution. He added that
he was s t i l l Saconsultation with the ground-
sman about this.
In reply to a polite question from the
chair, the Hon,Sec. said that there was
no oorredpondenoe.
•
: lections followed. For the vacant post
of Vice Chairman,there was one candidate
only,Mr.Brough. He was duly elected. N.
Ramsbottom and C,MaoCrae were elected to
the 'Executive.Mr.Kealey was elected to
the eolours sub-committee and was also
appointed gymnasium organiser.
On the question of finance,the Chair-
man emphasised the importance of ""the
accuracy of the estimates,so that the nec-
essity Bfb asking for supplementary grants
at abater date night be avoided. This i s
important because the ACC budget i s wor-
ked out at tha beginning of the session
and supplementary grants tend to upset
.the balance.
The Chairman also said that a l l olub
income must be paid directly to the Hon.
Senior Treasurer(Dr.MoCoubrey)and that
this money must not be used as a source
of petty cash. This was to be obtained
from Dr.MoCoubrey.
Two tour reports war* read.The orioket
club gave an expurgated version of the
Devon tour,, and the Lawn Tennis olub gave
an account of their tour i n Holland.
With regard to the matter of colours,
several observations of note were made by
Mr.hill(Frea.I,C.U.).
When the gymnasium timetable was dis-
cussed, the Chairman asked i f the Athletic
<aub^pi®wides f a o U i t t e s f o r people who'
wanVecf" to do olrouit training for the sake
of cicuit training.Mr.Cleator s a i d that
such "brownbaggers"would be welcome.to
train with members of the Athletic Club.
Mr.Yorke said that these people ware
quite welcome to train with the Boxing
Olub (?)
N. Ramsbottom drew attention to the)
untidy habits of certain weight-lifters
i n the gymnasium. In reply.Mx,Hill said
that the a Union rule existed whioh emp-
owered the Gymnasium Officer with the
right to forbid people to uae the gymnas-
ium without his approval,and that this
rule oould be invoked i n suoh cases.
Since there was not muoh other busin-
ess, the meeting was closed"somewhere about
R U G B Y
The Fresher's reception proved once
again that the game i s increasing i n
popularity. This year 100 freshmen or
thereabouts have expressed the wish to
play. Attendance at the constituent c o l -
lege t r i a l s on Wednesday and the I.C.tr-
i a l s on Saturday(de3pite the t e r r i b l e
weather)were excellent.

A team of seven left London for
Rotterdam on Wednesday 29th. June for
a ten days tennis tour of the Nether-
lands.
Unfortunately we were not able to
send as Strang a team as we hoped, and
only two of the touring team were reg-
ular members of the 1st.VX. When the
teur was f i r s t proposed rost of the
College's better players had been en-
thusiastic, but at l a t e r stages found
•'themselves unable to come for various
reasons. Thus our hosts were.inevita-
bly left with a very erronious impre-
ssion of our standard of play.
Our f i r s t day i n Rotterdam was™
ipent in sightseeing,and the following
lay we travelled to Delft,the strongest
of the Dutoh Universities^or our f i r s t
matoh.Roger Haycock1
3 f i r s t singles was
against Wilhelm Maris,the Holland No.1,
who had just returned from Wimbledon,
having been beaten by Neale FraserJfeed
less to aay,Maris won a l l his singles
and doubles matches,and our only v i c t o -
ry was i n the bootom doubles,where Ian
Cameron and Tim M a r t i n won narrowly.Af-
tfit the match we were entertained mag-
n i f i c e n t l y by the students at t h e i r
club.
From Delft we travelled to the Ha-
gue, After a day's sightseeing i n the
Hague, we played our next match againt
Leiden University, which was also lost,
but only by a narrow margin. The most
exciting match was between our f i r s t
pair, Roger Haycock and David Glasser,
and the Butoh f i r s t pair. I.C. just
won 8-6, 9-11, 13-11.
Next day we went to Amsterdam, and
played against the students on the m
covered courts of the Amsterdam Lawn
Tennis Club. The matoh was drawn 4 - 4 ,
Mioheal Bottomly and Alan Metheroott,
each winning two matches.
The l a s t match was a friendly affair
against Haarlem Lawn Tennis Club, and
the following day we returned to London
v i a Rotterdam.
