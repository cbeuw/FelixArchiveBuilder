Dear S i r ,
I am w r i t i n g to express
my amazement and disgust a t the
c h i l d i s h d r i v e l l i n g s of R. T.L.Foth-
eringham. I must assume that he comes
from RSK,as/only there oan one f i n d
suoh immature expression of the o l d
White Sahib o u l t .
Mr.Fotheringham objects* to
the interminable wranglings encoun-
tered at Union Meetings. Surely the
whole point of a Union Meeting i s t o
allow each member the opportunity to
express h i s views on the running of h i s
Union. Perhaps Mr.Fotheringham forgets
that the Union belongs to a l l i t s mem-
bers and not to the sheltered few. - even
the slimy left-wingers pay t h e i r fees.
As f a r as the propagation of
new s o c i e t i e s i s concerned,Mr.Fothering-
ham aaatly t w i s t s tha- facts'. to s u i t - h i s
d i s t o r t e d argument. Despite a Union meet-
ing r e s o l u t i o n supporting the Boycott,
there has never been a Boycott society,
and there has never been any suggestion
of a P a c i f i s t Society.
Mr.Fotheringham objects ^o the
l o g i c a l suggestion that the President be
elected by the Union General Meeting.
Obviously,the only hope of having a Pres-
ident supporting h i s v i o l e n t l y reaction-
ary views i s to have the e l e c t i o n done
i n camera by a few sycophantic oroniea,
purporting to represent the more respon-
s i b l e elements of the College,
I suggest that Mr.Fotheringham
returns t o the home of the gentleman
and exgrcises his venom by whipping a
few wogs.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
J.Watson.
Dear S i r ,
In reply to c e r t a i n remarks
about the nomenclature of the business
manager of F e l i x , I must t e l l you that
he i s P.Young,and,as f a r as I kacmr
Young is. the bearer o f the name P.Young.
I f P.Young wishes to d i s s o c i a t e him-
s e l f from Felix,he w i l l have t o either
a l t e r h i s name or adopt the t i t l e P P . ^ J i .
B.Young himself. I suggest he has invented
ths name f o r himself .Is P.Young,sir,a nom-
ie-plume? 0 r i s i t a w i l d f r e a k of P.
Young's imagination? I,sir,am P,Young,and
refine to disappear merely a t the whim of
an anonymous preparer of mineral waters,
»ho has assumed my name.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
P.Young.(Business Manager)

Dear S i r ,
I demand an apologyj Your i n f -
amous rag has(inadvertently)committed a
gross slander on my name and lowered my
reputation from next-to-nothing t o noth-
i n g - a t - a l l . But perhaps I-should explain
the s i t u a t i o n .
I t a l l began l a s t Wednesday when
I bought a copy of your l a t e s t issue and
turned i n a desultory fashion to the E d i t -
o r i a l page-I was ourious to see who was
producing the paper this year. I was e l e c t -
r i f i e d t o see,at the bottom of the l i s t ,
that I was business manager. I didn't rem-
ember being appointed t o t h i s post,but
that i s not s u r p r i s i n g since I usually
forget a whole p i l e of junk - science
f o r instanoe - over the summer vacation.
But then i t struck me that I was
holding a espy i n my hand without anyone
having told me to get on with the bus-
iness of managing; - I mean the managing
of the business,or whatever I was sup-
posed to do. That was most odd;how the
h e l l would you have produced the wret-
ohed thing without my assistance? I was
hegining to get r e a l l y worried - was. I
s u f f e r i n g from a Peouliar Case of Amnesia?
Had I imagined the whole thing?Was i t
r e a l l y F e l i x I waa holdlng?Where was I ? . .
....Who was I? What was I?
A l i g h t dawned, - i t wasn't me a t a l l ,
but someone else;there i s another P.
Vfoung in. the college.
Now Sir,you oan understand my
f e e l i n g s about t h i s matter and you und-
oubtedly see the reasonableness of my
request. I f - as I suspect - t h i s "P.
Young"is r e a l l y p.B.Young,or P.Z.Young,
or even P.Q.R.S.Young,would you please
p r i n t h i s f u l l complement of i n i t i a l s ;
i f he has just one name would you bring
i t t o the notioe of the whole of I.C.
that I am not your business manager.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
P.Young.
To Mr.R.T.L.Fotheringham.
Dear S i r ,
I Due t o the aleak o f art)-'
onymity that surrounds you,there i s no
record of you being a t I.e.,I am forced
to communicate w i t h you i n this fashion.
You state that l a s t year
there was an attempt made to form a South
A f r i c a n Boycott s o c i a t y . l t i s true that
there was a South A f r i c a n society propos-
ed,but i t s aim was t o counter the boyoott
and i t very soon f a i l e d due to laok of
support. However,you may be r e f e r r i n g to
the Boyoott sub-oommittee of the I n t e r -
national Relations Club. I would point
eat that t h i s i s aa established eoamittae
and not a proposed society. Moreover, to
my knowledge there has been no attempt to
form any other group to deal with t h i s
aubjeot. What then were you r e f e r r i n g t o
i n your l e t t e r i n the l a s t issue of F e l i x ?
I f you were r e f e r r i n g t o the
IRC sub-oommittee,then.aa founder of t h i s
aootaittee.and as Hon.Sec of the IRC,I would
appear t o q u a l i f y as "a person i n charge
of a society and t r y i n g to form a South
A f r i c a n boyoott society." Thus,I am des-
cribed by you as "a slimy left-wing Foot-
nick" or communist. My main occupation,I
discover, i s e i t h e r dragging out Union
Meetings by interminable wranglings, or
i n s i d i o u s l y s l i d i n g myself i n t o command
of sooieties.
In r e p l y , I would say that *
>
before your l e t t e r , I thought I was a r e l -
a t i v e l y normal I..ACKILLAN TORY. I genuinely
thought that I had been democratically
elected to my o f f i c e and I f e l t sure that
try speeches a t Union meetings never lasted
more than a minute.
Thus I would ask you to help
me. I f you'are not mistaken,then,can you
explain how,overnight,I have turned i n t o
the e v i l monster you describe.
I eagerly await your esteemed
r e p l y .
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
D.S.Keroer.
