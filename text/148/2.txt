The Union's s o c i a l olubs can be
roughly divided i n t o three groupsi nat-
-ional clubs, r e l i g i o u s clubs, and p o l -
- i f c i c a l olubs. In the former category
arm* the Arab, Chinese, Indian, Pakistan,
e?.,i PcVish Societies. The general aims of
th*i»3 «>oieties seem t o be the streng-
-thea.-;<% of morale among t h e i r own members,
who a r e ' o s s e t i a l l y resident i n a strange
country and t o act as ambassadors t o the
rest of the College.
The Jewish Society seems to f a l l mid-
-way i n c l a s s i f i c a t i o n between the nat-
-ional clubs and the r e l i g i o u s olubs.
There are two evangelical C h r i s t i a n soo-
- i e t i e s , the Student C h r i s t i a n Movement
(S.C.M.) and C h r i s t i a n Union (C.U.)
The C.U, requires i t s members to aco-
~ept ten points of doctrine, whereas
the S.C.M. w i l l accept members of any
C h r i s t i a n denomination. To c a t e r f o r
s p e c i f i c a l l y denominational i n t e r e s t s
there are the Catholic, Church),Anglicm./
and Methodist Societies. There i s a l s o
the nawly formed Islamio Society.
Humanists are represented by the Huxley
Society.
The p o l i t i c a l s o c i e t i e s have represent
-atives of the four main p a r t i e s i n the
Conservative Sooietyjsthe S o c i a l i s t
Society, the L i b e r a l Society, and the
Marxist Forum. In addition there i s
the Inter national Relations Club (I.C.R.)
which acts p a r t l y i n the r o l e of hosts
to overseas students and p a r t l y as a
forum f o r the discussion of i n t e r n a t i o n a l
p o l i t i c s . L a s t l y there i s the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament (C.N.D.)
The a c t i v i t i e s of these s o c i e t i e s
are c o n t r o l l e d , co-ordinated, and pro-
-moted by the S o c i a l Clubs Committee
(S.C.C".) on which a representative of
each society has a place. The S.C.C.
administers grants to the s o c i e t i e s ,
disbands the moribund s e e i e t i e a and
approves the formation of new ones.
As a reminder to members, the next
S.C.C. neeting'is a$ 5.45 p.m. on
October 17th. i n Conmittee Room "A".
The Recreational Clubs Committee has
been formed i n order to- ease the admin-
- i s t r a t i v e burden of the S.C.C. Last
year the S.C.C.r 8 n f o r t y clubs., These
olubs have now been d i v i d e d i n t o two
roughly equal committees.
The f i r s t meeting, of the R.C.C.
w i l l be convened ifft h e near future
and the o f f i c e r s f o r the year w i l l
be elected.

Doc Pritchard,late of t h i s oolumn,is
now blowing r e a l l y way out i n Canada.
His Prof.wears a grotty o l d T-shirt,and
plays tenor.Sounds l i k e an absolute gas.
On the l o c a l scene,Miles Davis has been
gigging around town. Reports I have rec-
eived.state that Chambers and S t i t t were
a gas,in f a c t r e a l l y way-out,but the
rest of the f e l l e r 3 spent most of t h e i r
time "blowing off-stage.Not having seen
the show,I must r e l y on the monosyllabic
vocal d e l i v e r y of the Hammersmith Gaum-
ont ice-cream vendors. They were d i s -
appointed.
The Imperial College jazz scene looks
a l l set f o r a b l i s t e r i n g year. Notable
new ventures are the new hard-bop group,
a funky piano-les3 quartet,an outfit,
f e a t u r i n g two trombones,and a seventy-
f i v e piece rock band. Jazz club chief
Mike Saith'.is expected to blow hard-
d r i v i n g skins,with the odd s k u l l and
Chinese block thrown i n . Nut-boy baS3
player,John Farnsworth,will be bend-
ing that big-toned f i d d l e . I am t o l d
he was l a s t 3een heading south from
Glencoe,on the road with bass,trom-
bone and f i v e crates of Scotch, Like

Since the end of l a s t session,the Jazz
club yak-harness has disappeared. This i s
going to make things d i f f i c u l t f o r the
Jazz club yaks. I am hoping to introduoe
standardised jazz uniform f o r a l l the
f e l l e r a this year. Green shades,beat' white
duck trousers,smock and rope sandals.
L i k e , d i g those swing threadsT Dad.I,am
also compiling a beat d i c t i o n a r y ,
packed w i t h swinging phrases straight
from i n f i n i t y . A must f o r anyone hop-
ing to make the scene.
We end,this week,on a p o l i t i c a l note;
I mean,Khruschev's a sweetie,but l e t ' s
face it,he just doesn't swing.

. ov; that the President and Secretary
of the Union are both Roman Catholics,
the time may have come to consider the
suggestion of one Union member that the
bar be closed during Lent. We also hear
that the Union o f f i c e i s to be used f o r
lunch hour confessions. Charges w i l l be
modest,and a pay-as-you-confess scheme
i3 to be introduced.
Overheard*on the ICWA c o r r i d o r ; " I don't'
think I s h a l l have to get married."
We hear that Bob Finch's s i s t e r i s be-
smirching the f a m i l y name by j o i n i n g the
C.U. Perhaps the college's leading i n f i d -

He are pleased to note that the 1

Congratulation- -o Jtooney On the open-
ing of the Buttery i n Queensgate,for ev-
ening meala for postgraduates and members
of s t a f f . The q u a l i t y of the food here
i s very good.One improvement to a l l the
r e f e c t o r i e s which would cost very l i t t l e
i n terms of time and money,is the provis-
ion of paper table napkins.
We have heard that the takings i n the
Bar during the l a s t 3ession showed a rec-
ord p r o f i t . The p r o f i t made i n the bar
has,for some years helped to reduce the
l o s s madein the refectory,but l a s t year,
the refectory also made a p r o f i t . Surely
i t i s not Union p o l i c y to run the bar at
a p r o f i t , a t the expense of student's hard-
earned grants. Then why doesn't the ref-
ectory committee reduce the price of beer?
I t i s to be hoped that i n the immedi-
ate future the antiquated magic-box i n
the reading room w i l l be replaced by a
more r e l i a b l e model. The present one suf-
f e r s from severe f a t i g u e . Strange buzzing
sounds are c o n t i n u a l l y heard and myster-
ious white l i n e s occasionally whizz acr-
oss the screen. The Union can c e r t a i n l y
a f f o r d the e x t r a 1+3 per week(out of bar
p r o f i t s ? ) f o r a new super-de-luxe model.
This would c e r t a i n l y s a t i s f y the most
i l l u s t r i o u s and overworked gentleman at
I.C. Indeed,an i n s p i r e d President could
go f u r t h e r and arrange f o r a gigantic .
screen to be f i t t e d i n t o the wall,as at
ULU. The s i g h t of beautious ICWArians
a c t i n g as usherettes and s e l l i n g pop-
corn and ice-cream would soon make the
reading room the most popular i n the
Union.
With the s t a r t of a new session,refec-
tory queues have once again become quite
i n t o l e r a b l e . The trouble i s that nothing
can be done about them. The k i t c h e n , i n
fact,seems to have been designed i n order
to defy a l l attempts to improve i t . With
r e f e c t o r i e s on three f l o o r s to be suppl-
