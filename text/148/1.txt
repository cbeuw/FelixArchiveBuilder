FUST PRIZE FOR JEZEBEL
Daring the vacation the R.C.S.
Motor Club took Jezebel, the f i r e -
engine nasoot of the Royal College
of Science Union, down to Basildon
near Southend, to compete in a rally
organised by the Historic and Com-
-meroial Vehioles Club.
Setting eff early i n the morning
of Sunday 11th. September in bright
sunshine we soon ran into heavy traff-
-ic and were delayed in several jams.
As a result Of this we arrived late i n
Basildon and missed the start of the
parade. However, by judicious use of
the accelerator we managed to catch up
along the route. appropriately enougl
the parade ended up at a oenaercial
vehicle repair station where the oom-
-peting vehicles were lined up far the
Conoours d'
Dominant among the entries were
eleven Model "T" Fords, and a 1922
de Dion roadsweeper. This fine veh-
-iole was complete with de Dion rear
axle and with a l l attachments in werk-
-ing order.
The Conoours d' Elegance was f o l -
-lowed by a driving test. In this the
President of the R.C.S. Motor Club,
Jin King, incurred the least number of
penalty points and consequently won
f i r s t prize. One of the photographs en
this page shows Jim reoeiving the prize
from the president of the H.C.V.C. The
other photograph, for the benefit of
those new to the College, i s an older
picture of "Jez." in Prince Consort Kd.
After securing the prize money we
made a hasty getaway. On the return
journey we stepped only twice, f i r s t l y
to quench our own thirsts at a pub,
and secondly to quench Jez's when she
ran out Â»f petrol.

There are,in t h i s college,a large riSira-
ber of inoffensive people who are v a r i o u s -
l y called yachtsmen,sailing-types,etc..
They may look inoffensive,but I oan assure
you that when they get a f l o a t , o r whatever
the technical termis,they are d e v i l s i n -
carnate.
Once,and only once,have I ever been
sailing,and i t was the most i n c r e d i b l e
a f f a i r . The gentleman started by t e l l i n g
me a l l about haliards,rudders,sheets and
a l o t of other s t u f f that I didn't un-
derstand.
We set o f f . "Steadyl"he cried,"We're
going aboutJ""Aboutt?" I said."About
what?"And then i t happened, tilth a sud-
den swing the boat attempted to turn a
r i g h t angle,the thing that hangs from the
mast hit me,and I was hurled into the
water. I clambered back,It was some time
before he stopped laughing.Of course
we repeated t h i s process a l i t t l e time
later. That was i t as f a r as I was con-
cerned.
Last week,a s a i l i n g club man asked me
to go s a i l i n g w i t h him. I declined the
o f f e r . Wouldn't you?
