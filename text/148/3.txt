It w i l l be obvious to more other-
direoted among my readers, that not a l l
the future leaders of industry who
oome to I.C., achieve the (status* of,
say, President of the Union. I t i s

Remesoer.in the Union organisation
there i s a niche f o r everyonel
The task, then, whioh faces
each and a l l of us, and some more
than others, i s to consider objectively
in what way, however "humbly, we oan
best f i t into the general pattern.
Having achieved t h i s , i t merely
remains to establish oneself un-
ambiguously by aquisition of the
appropriate status symbols.
The objeot of this guide i s there-
fore, to analyses the main levels
•of Union organisation, and t o point
out some of the mare obvious symbols
other than the Colcutt t o s w %
B a s i c a l l y , members of the Union,
by which term I mean those who have
paid the-stipulated fees (or rather
have them paid), f a l l into three o a t —
agories, which f o r ease of ident-
i f i c a t i o n I w i l l designate: Top Men,
Keen Types and Brown-Baggers. The
latter.form, an overwhelming majority
and are essential to the smooth
running of the organization. By
vbluntardlyt f6regoing t h e i r
legitimate rights, they free the
finances and f a c i l i t i e s of v'the
Union, whioh are, i n any oaso,
quite inadequate to cater f o r a l l
potential customers, f o r the use
of the less-aeademloally f i x a t e d .
Brown-Baggers are usually smartly
dressed and have the appearance of
harbouring inoipient u l c e r s .
By no means are they *e~*be oon-
faaed with those other smartly
dressed men of hurried step and
preoccupied expression, whom you
w i l l f i n d are going not to leotures
but to oommittee meetings. These
are Tpp ilen (or Union O f f i c i a l s ) and
r e a l l y are harbouring ulcers, i n s p i t e
of the tennis, Suoh men w i l l often
be seen wearing ourious t i e s on Thur-
sdays: t h i s i s d e f i n i t e l y the ultimate
status symbol sartorialwise.
Between these elegant extremes
slouch a variety of oiks, odds and
sods, clean-limbed, clear.eyed quick -
thinking B r i t i s h Youths, e t s . , who
alone provide the administrators with
something to administrate. I t i s to
them, the very baokbone of our Glorious
•College, that, these remarks are primar-
i l y dlraoted. Who else reads F e l i x
any way; i t is.no substitute f a r 2**
Times,Wool, etc.
These Keen^Typee oan be sub-divided
into Beerdrinkers and Others. This d i s -
t i n s t i o n tends to beoome rather 'indistinct
• e s p e c i a l l y around d o s i n g time. Never-
the-less one should point out the o f f i c -
i a l objeot of Frehers Dinners i s to loo-
ate the obvious supping talent as early
as possible w i t h a view to grooming i t
f o r future stardom. ]^«ajjeo$ive
Sporting Types should bear this w e l l i n
mind especially when not r e a l l y f i r s t
teas material; i t oan make all' the*
difference .
Those, who donlt happen to l i k e
beer (especially the southern v a r i e t -
ies derived by degradation from de-
natured dish-water) sftould, in-gen-
e r a l and along with the less energetio
beer drinkers head f o r the l e s s e r
glories and greater oomforts offered by
the numerous Social .Clubs, Sou'ld you
be Exsoutive 'material' t h i s route to
the Top i s not unduly disadvantageous.
The sain objective of.Joining any
club i s to get elected to the ccatmittee,
33»&« i s simply a maSter vT getting:
pbsed and seoonded by other prospective
oommittee members an return f o r similar
favours. Having thus become a demoora
tioally chosen representative on as many
committees as possible you will then
stand 3ome'sort of chance of getting i n
to Hostel It.is ofcourse true that some
Freshers are already i n residence.
We can only hope, that the Union w i l l
survive this fundamental blow to i t s
struoture . The optimum p o s i t i o n i3
to have been i n residence as long as
possible and then to move into a f l a t
i n Queen's Gate; but t h i s takes
time. Meanwhile, you should aquire a
motor bike or battered o l d par, which
w i l l be dead cheap i n view of the
advent of Vehicle Testing, and park i t
in sens prominent place. It i s an
advantage to be seen working on i t
at intervals, since i t w i l l not then be
neoeaaary for the thing to astaally go
and money oan be saved on p e t r o l ,
'On the academic side i t can be
a good thing to repeat a year but t h i s
i s t r i c k y and, i n any case, you w i l l
want to get a s u f f i c i e n t l y good deg-
ree to do a i.G. course. This i s
e s s e n t i a l i f you are to f u l f i l l your
Union potential. In general, do not
make the mistake of pushing tooramubh;
i t rubs people up the wrong way.
For example don't go jumping Sefreotory
queues, however long, just to.be seen
with the right people; i t i s much
better to buy them a drink i n the Bar
afterwards. They may buy you one some
day and then you are in - a f t e r a
fashion. A policy of conformity with
i n your chosen group always -pays o f f
best.' ' The faot that this group may
hold r a d i c a l opinions; pro-N.U.S.-,
down-with-Council, etc., i s neither
here nor there provided you are
consistent. By a l l means a i r your
views i n Fell*"and at Union Meetings,
then everyone w i l l know where you
stand. That i3 the eaential point.
I have, of necesity, had to
generalise extensively i n this short
treatise. Never-the-less i t i s my hope
that a careful appraisal of my remarks,

And that was a l l - for a moment
, nothing happened, the cigarettes glowed
on,the smoke rose upwards, then:
"Okay, Lights" - the director slew-
ed round in bis chair. "I think you'll
agree,Nicky, that was pretty hopeless.,
We'll have a re-shoot, but i f you can't
do better - wail, we'll have to get
someone else. Dejan_.it a l l , the script
says ' terror in the eyes'. Yours were
aa terrified as the herrings."
I stood at the back of the projec-
tion room and watched the falling star.
F A L L I N G S T A R
I stood in the dark and watched,
Nicholas K. Housman had had this
coming to him for a long time, the
egotistical swine. So I stood i n
the dark and smiled.
The amerioan diplomatist pat-
tered down the stairs from the Emb
basay. Briefcase under arm, carna-
tion in buttonhole and the emaoul-
ately clean suede gloves gripping
the elegantly tapered cane, he
swung off down the road into the
dusk. The confident stride of
the man who oontrolled".the destiny
ies of hundreds of states,
thousands of towns, m i l l i o n s of
lives, oould be heard long a f t e r
he had disappeared into the failing
light.
The tread of his follower was
the very antithesis. Furtive,
skulking, the swarthy foreigner-
kept the Ambassador in sight. -
They threaded their way
through the Belgradian Mews coun-
try, through the thickening
yellow gloom, over the glistening
eobble-stenes. They were in the
heart of the maze now. They pass
~ed the pink and yellow doored flats
and the long lines of dirty garages.
The*foreigner knocked on a garage
whioh instantly opened on well o i l -
ed hinges. But we followed the
striding American along the foot
of the ravine formed by the tower
ing flats, passed the battered
dustbins, their lids askew, with
the emaciated kitten gnawing at
the rotting herring with the
phosphorescent f l e s h .
The American paused on,the
corner and fumbled f o r h i s gold
cigarette case. 4ie oatoh him up
here'beneath the cone of feefble "light
emitted by the street lamp with the
dramatically broken pane. I t s
rays slanted h i s well-nourished face
and deep-set eyes. The rumble of
West"*End t r a f f i c could be heard i n
the distance and was now joined
by the purring of a large car as i t
crawled up the mews.
Ha tossed the maftch away and
stepped on to the cobbled road. The
Renault's headlights pioked him out.
The roar of t h i r t y horses, released
simultaneously,ricochetted up the
mews. Housman threw himself des-
perately backwards,blinded by the
blazing lamps. He slipped on the wet
cobbles.' His legs waved grotesquely
in the a i r . The s i l v e r buffer reared
over him, the on-side tyres soythed
towards h i s body. F r a n t i c a l l y he r o l -
led i n t o the gutter. The next second
the cold g r i t t y rubber appeared t o pass
over h i s elegantly creased trouser-
leg. The car jolted and swerved and
Houseman must have f e l t the heat of the
exhaust beat on h i s face. The car
skidded to a h a l t .
The Amerioan l a y there writhing i n
a pool,of i r r i d e s c e n t o i l - s t a i n e d water,
writhing amongst those b e a u t i f u l colours.
That expression on h i s face - i t was
damned funny r e a l l y , I could hardly stop
myself-laughing. The doors slammed.
Housman made a desperate struggle to
avoid the i r o n bar which flashed down
on his close-cropped s k u l l - but i t ' s
d i f f i o u l t to move f a s t when both your
legs are broken. That part was done
well enough. The now f i l t h y suede
gloves feebly warded o f f the blow, but
i t landed neatly on h i s temple. His
head dropped back into the oil-stained
water and the blood, t r i c k i n g from h i s
ear, added i t s l u s t r e to those beauti-
ful colours.
