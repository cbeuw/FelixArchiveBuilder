Twickenham
Regatta
Boat club
double triumph
Last Saturday trie Boat Club's
elite coxless four entered their
first regatta of the summer at
Twickenham. The course was
1100 metres long, upstream on
the River Thames.
In the first round, the crew
faced the might of Reading
University, who will probably be
one of their opponents later in the
summer at Henley. The IC crew,
who had had difficulty steering in
training, had problems on the
twisting Twickenham course. Off
the start they quickly took a one
length lead and then rowed and
steered as badly as possible, still
holding their one length lead.
Just before the finish, Reading
sprinted reducing the deficit to
half length on the line.
In the final the IC crew faced a
four from University College.
The IC four once again had
difficulty steering, but once
straight quickly pulled away to
win by 3 lengths.
•EDITORIAL*
Papers are up for posts on the ACC Exec next year. I would like to
encourage people to stand for a post. Anyone requiring information about'
the job is welcome to contact the current holder of that post via the Union,
Office. Please note: the ACC Chairman doesn't automatically get to
knock off the President next year!
You probably won't have noticed the ad for Sports Day on this page.
Sports Day is a good chance to have a relaxing day out after the exams.
Contrary to popular belief, it's not a 'hacks' day out, but a chance for
anyone in College to have a run, whether they can run or not. Oh, yes I
almost forgot, there's a good bar at Motspur.
In the last FELIX on 20 June, I will do a Sports Review of the Year.
Unfortunately, I've forgotten who's done what, so could clubs list their
achievements this year and send me any good pictures as well by
Wednesday 13 June.

Record Score
A winning draw for IC was
m e m o r a b l e for a superb
undefeated 136 by Chris Cole
which was the highest ever score
by an IC batsman recorded at
Harlington.
Acting captain Lionel King
lost the toss and rapidly had his
pads on and off as two quick
wickets fell for 22. This brought
Chris Cole to the wicket and he
immediately showed his disdain
for some absolutely rank bowling
by not bothering to play himself
in and, dispatching the ball to all
parts of the ground. Cole,
striking the ball hard and clearly,
with particularly impressive
straight driving, scored his runs
in better than even time and
removed Q E C skipper Madelin
by taking 36 off his final two
overs.
At 136 stand-in opener Tom
Nicholls was out for a slow 25
and with John Collins not
troubling the scorers. Kenny
Jarret joined Cole at the wicket.
Soon afterwards Cole reached his
century with his 12th four. The
partnership had thrashed 95
when the innings was declared at
244-4
