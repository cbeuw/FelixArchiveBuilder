ACCOMMODATION
Summer Vacation
If you're wondering how to occupy yourself over the next three months
or you're looking for some remunerative employment in an attempt to
wipe out this year's overdraft, then staying in London could be the
answer to your problems. Many students spend three years in London
without ever really discovering the city and since London abounds
with large department stores who regularly seek extra staff during the
summer, why not stay in London and combine work and holiday?
Accommodation is available in IC Halls and Head Tenancies for
both staff and students at term time rates throughout the summer.
Although the closing date for applications has officially passed, we do
still have a few vacancies, so if you're interested collect an application
form from Student Services.
You may also have some friends or relatives who want to spend
some time in London over the summer. Again we offer
accommodation at cheap rates so why not call into Student Services
for further details.
Next Year
Obviously many of you are now anxious to start the search for
accommodation for next year. Although October may not seem far
away to you, unfortunately most private landlords/ladies do not plan
their accommodation this far in advance and therefore Student
Services don't become informed of the vast majority of
accommodation until September. We do have a limited amount of
accommodation for next session on our noticeboards at the moment,
so if for any reason you can't use September to find accommodation it
is worth calling into Student Services to see if we can help.
If you are able to come down to London in September, this is by far
the best time to look. We should be able to accommodate you in an IC
residence any time up to 22 September, just give us a ring on 01-589
5111 ext 2033 a couple of weeks before you come down. After that
there should be crash pad accommodation in the Student Union (just
bring a sleeping bag). In September Student Services should have
comprehensive lists of vacancies«and an accommodation guide to give
you hints on where to start. You may not discover the home of your
dreams, but with a little patience, footwork and a lot of 5p pieces you
should be able to find something reasonable.

Further details & application forms from
Your grant 1984/5
As most of you are probably aware the undergraduate rates of grant for 1984/5
were announced in April. For those of you who missed the original announcement,
the figures are reproduced below. Also for those students (and their parents) who
want to plan their finances ahead I have included the new scales for parental,
spouse's and student's own contributions to the grant which should enable you to
make an approximate calculation of how much money to expect from yaw local
education authority. The basic rates of grant have been increased by 4% but there
is bad newsforthose students living on a minimum grant as this has been halved to
£210 for the year. The other significant change is the doubling of the travel clement
in the grant from £50 to £100 but remember new students will no longer be able to
claim any excess travelling monies on top of this and current students will only be
able to reclaim expenses above £250.1 have included this year's grantfiguresas a.

The Means Test
l ndergraduate grants are means-tested against parental, spouse's and student's own
income leaving very few students collecting full grants from their education authorities.
Grants are means-tested against residual income. Residual income equals gross income for
the financial year preceeding the start of the academic year in question, less certain
allowances which for 1984/5 are:
a) Dependents (other than children or spouse) £980
b) Domestic assistance in certain circumstances £780
c) Parent who holds a statutory award £400
In respect of each dependent child (other than the student) the following deductions will
be made from the assesed parental contribution: Non-award holders £80; Award holders
£225.
1. Parental Contribution
The scale of parental contributions is given below. The 1984/5 scale slightly decreases the
burden on parents whose incomes are below £11,000, but increases the burden on those
w ith higher incomes. This is likely to increase students' dependence on their parents at a
time when many will already be suffering due to the halving of the minimum award.
Residual Income 1983/4 Contribution 1984/5 Contribution

7500 77 —

16000 1038 1370
18000 1237 1703
20000 1391 2036
Rate of contribution is assessed at £ I in £7 between £7460 and £9700 and £ I in £6 from
there on.
2. Spouse's Contribution
The scale of spouse's contribution is as follows:
ne 1983/4 Contribution 1984/5 Contribution
5500 1

6000 no 30

12000 1010 990
13000 1110 1090
14000 1210 1190
Rate of contribution is assessed at £1 in £5 between £5400 and £9600 and at £1 in £10
from there on.
3. Student's Own Income
Any student who has a term time income of over £400 (vacation earnings don't count) will
be expected to contribute to their own grant. Any additional income above £400 is
deducted £ 1 for £ I from the grant. However there is an additional disregard of £580 for
scholarships or payments from employers and a special disregard of £850 for National
Engineering Scholars.
