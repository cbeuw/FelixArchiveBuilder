JOHN SMITH REPRIEVES FLATS
Students to
keep Penthouse
for 2 years
Two of the Southside penthouseflatsare to continue to be let to
students until the present Southside Wardens complete their
contracts, it was revealed this week. In a clarification of his earlier
statements College Secretary John Smith said that this would
mean bothflatsbeing occupied by students next session and one
the following session, after which they will both be used by
academic staff wardens.
There are four flats on the
Southside penthouse level which
were originally all occupied by
wardens, one for each of Selkirk,
Tizard, Keogh and Falmouth
Halls. Two years ago two of these
were let to students and the
number of wardens reduced to
two. It has now been decided that
when the present wardens, D r
Paul Jowitt and D r Henry
Hutchinson, finish their terms of
office two wardens will be
appointed to replace each of
them, so reverting to the original
situation with four wardens for
four halls.
This leaves the reason for the
change even more obscure than
before. It was thought that
opposition from the present
wardens to students occupying
the flats was a major reason, but
this now seems unlikely and
indeed was strongly refuted by
Dr Jowitt in an interview with
F E L I X this week. Dr Jowitt also
said he was not bothered one way
or the other regarding the
appointment of the additional
wardens now or next year. Both
wardens had agreed that John
Smith could appoint the
additional wardens this year if he
wished, but they would not object
to students continuing to occupy
the flats.
P G Handbook
A Union working party are to put
forward proposals for an I C U
Postgraduate Handbook. The
aims of the publication will be to
explain to final year under-
graduates what research is like,
and to provide a general
introduction to the P G lifestyle
for fresher postgraduates.
The handbook will have two
functions. It will be distributed to
present undergraduate students,
at IC and elsewhere, who are
considering applying to do a
postgraduate course or research
at the College.
The H a n d b o o k is the
brainchild of Hugh Stiles, R C C
Chairman and a first year
postgraduate in Chemical
Engineering. He explained that
the idea for the Handbook came
from a document he saw whilst at
the NUS Conference in Hull. He
set up a working party including
Chris Hendy (PG Affairs), Robin
Graham (SCC) and David Rowe
( F E L I X Editor-elect) to consider
the problem. This group will put
forward their proposals to the
Joint Council meeting on 22
June.
Sinclair Gdns sunk
Residents of the Head Tenancy
flats in Sinclair Gardens are
protesting about the College's
decision to drop the accommo-
dation next session.
The decision not to renegotiate
the agreement with the landlord
was taken as long ago as last
summer and was approved by the
Student Residence Committee in
October. Student Services Officer
Michael Arthur told F E L I X that
it was impossible to keep the flats
full in the summer vacation since
they were a small isolated unit of
only four flats with 26 beds in
total. It was uneconomic to
employ a summer lettings
manager for such a small number
so it could not be let in the same
way as Hamlet Gardens. Few
students wanted to live there in
summer, and so as a result a lot of
money was lost. In 1982/3 as a
whole (including the summer
vacation) the flats lost Â£4,516.
In a letter to F E L I X (see page
2) Student Manager Caroline
Low claims the flats offer
perfectly good accommodation
and have only been losing money
as a result of the Student Services
Office's failure to let them in the
summer.
Miss Low has offered to
attempt to let the flats personally
over this summer, if this will lead
to a review of the College's
decision. The College will have to
keep the flats on until September
in any event as the present
agreement does not expire until
then and they have been included
on t h i s y e a r ' s s u m m e r
a c c o m m o d a t i o n a p p l i c a t i o n
forms for IC students. But the
College is unlikely to reverse its
decision unless it is confident that
no losses will be made in the
future.
The motorised mascots of RCSU and Guilds Union repaid a
debt on Saturday by providing the bridal car and fire engine
escort at the wedding of the son of Mr A Dowden, supervisor of
the Mech Eng workshops. JezabelandBoenerges are serviced
and repaired in the workshops and the mascots Mike, Theta
and Spanner & Bolt were made there. Mr Dowden's son,
Storm, was marrying Elizabeth Wakefield, secretary to the
Head of the Department of Mineral Resources Engineering.
After the wedding the mascots gave joy rides around College
for the guests and children.
