Head Tenancy
to Close
Dear Pallab
As Student Manager of the
Head Tenancy at Sinclair
Gardens I think that the threat
of its imminent demise should
be brought to notice before lack
of discussion is taken for
compliance and the matter is
allowed to slide under the
carpet.
S i n c l a i r G a r d e n s was
acquired three years ago as four
newly converted flats purpose-
built as a Head Tanancy by the
landlord of Hamlet Gardens—
the co-originator of the Head
Tenancy Scheme (with Michael
Arthur). Like all such places it
has its problems but. in general,
the flats represent a high
standard of spacious accommo-
dation—in contrast to that
generally available for second
/third years and PGs.
Michael Arthur feels that the
rent levels are too high and is
(quite rightly) concerned with
the loss of income during the
Summer Vacation. Equally, it
should be pointed out that no
loss is made during the nine
months of term time. The losses
in question were £4.000 the first
Summer, when r| s flats were
left virtually empty, and
further £ 1,800 last Summer as a
result of Student Service's
haphazard method of assigning
S u m m e r a c c o m m o d a t i o n
places. This has resulted in an
element of £2.50 per week being
included in our rent levels to
cover the anticipated loss for
this summer. Despite this our
rents are •iirectly comparable to
tho-e in other Head Tenancies
for what is, after all, higher
standard of accommodation.
In contrast. Hamlet Gardens
'Summer Letting Scheme' made
a profit of £245.000 last year by
advertising on the open market.
So successful is the scheme that
this year it has been expanded
to include Lexham Gardens for
the first time: however. Sinclair
Gardens is regarded as too
small a unit to participate.
I have been told that our lease
will only be renegotiated if I can
personally guarantee that there
will be no vacant places not this
summer but that of 1985! Since
inclusion under the Summer
Letting Scheme has been
deemed unsuitable, I have
suggested advertising to
students in either London, or
another university, or letting to
the general public via a legal
holiday-let lease. This could
most easily be accomplished
by letting Sinclair Gardens as
'family flats' over the entire
three month period—thus
avoiding administrative hassle.
I am perfectly prepared to do
all I can to help Student
Services, but their rejection of
my suggestions leaves me in the
impossible position of being
responsible for filling the flats
but with no obvious way of
achieving this.
In the last few years Student
Services have done well in
obtaining a large amount of
accommodation suitable for
first year undergraduates in
order to attract them to the
College. However, it seems a
great pity that a first, badly
needed, step in improving the
standard of accommodation for
second/third years and PGs
(who do. after all, constitute
75% of the student body)
should be abandoned and 26
more students condemned to
bedsitter land.

Shit-stirrers
incidents occuring at N U S
conferences. Jonathan's letter
provides no evidence to show
that the N U S did not act
impartially in the handling of
this year's Easter conference. I
suspect that far more students
would respect Jonathan's
stance against NUS if he was to
back it up with reasonable
arguments (of which there is
certainly no shortage) instead
of with provocative rhetoric, no
matter how tongue in cheek this
may be.
It would be dangerous for
Imperial College Union to
incite the student unions of
other colleges into disaffiliating
from N U S . We owe it to our
fellow students elsewhere to
provide them with an impartial
view of the consequences of
disaffilation so that they can
make up their own minds
before t a k i n g such an
important decision. Further-
more, IC Union has policy
stating that it is a non party
political body. I have no
intention of going against this
policy and pursuing a blatantly
party political course of action
of the whim of Jonathan and a
small minority of students at
IC.
Yours sincerely
Peter Burt
PS: Lest your readers suspect
that the there may be a trace of
animosity between Jonathan
and myself, may I hasten to
assure them that we are, in fact,
good friends.
Dear Pallab
At the risk of prolonging a
somewhat tedious exchange of
views. I shall briefly reply to last
week's letter form Jonathan
Gerson.
It is quite proper that there
should be debate within student
unions about the merits or
otherwise of affiliation to the
National Union of Students.
The Federation of Conservative
Students have chosen to
espouse the case against N U S
membership, but it appears that
they have adopted the tactics of
s e n s a t i o n a l i s m i n t h e i r
campaign by making a series of
unproven allegations about
Accident
not forgotten
Dear Pallab
Following the publication of
Giovanni Vacago's observa-
tions on RCC's safety policy
last week, I feel obliged to
explain a few points in rather
more detail.
Firstly, whilst as far as the
club were concerned the
accident of Christmas 1981 had
been forgotten, College had not
Page 21
•Friday, June 8, 19841
dismissed the matter so quickly
and were, when the Safety
P o l i c y d o c u m e n t s were
submitted, on the point of
contacting the Union regarding
club safety. College was
especially concerned about the
fate of a document produced in
June 1982 laying down various
rules in a code of safety
practice. Whilst well inten-
tioned, the proposals were
impracticable and unwieldy
principally because the widely
differing interests of the clubs
concerned had not been taken
into account.
It was because R C C had this
unimplemented document
hanging over it that in
November last year I took steps
to produce a more workable
scheme.
< At a meeting of the clubs
concerned, it was decided by
c o n s e n s u s to d r a w up
i n d i v i d u a l safety p o l i c y
documents featuring:
1. A formal agreement to
maintain a log book of the
names of participating club
members along with names,
contact address and, ideally,
telephone numbers of next of
kin and to take this log on all
outings. This log would be left
in a readily accessible place in
order that notification of
persons missing or dead could
quickly be passed to the
relatives.
2. Further safety standards
which the club in question
might wish to adopt.
T h u s it is the c l u b s
themselves who decide just how
much individual freedom will
be curtailed and not, as might
be construed from M r Vacago's
article, the R C C Exec.
The log book was felt to be
necessary because in the
Christmas 81 accident there was
considerable delay in next of
kin being informed since no one
knew the dead student's
s u r n a m e — o b v i o u s l y a n
unacceptable state of affairs.
Finally if, as Giovanni puts it
"another accident came to
shake our consciences" I would
most certainly hope that the
nature of, and the events
leading up to, the accident
would be scrutinised to see i f
anything could be learnt rather
than dismissing the idea of
further 'restrictions' out of
hand.
