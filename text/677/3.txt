Links MCPs get
off scot-free
Two senior Guilds Union
members who chanted 'no
women in the bar' to a number of
female students in the Union Bar
have not been disciplined by the
Union Executive. A complaint
was brought by Diane Love, A P
Editor, and Hugh Stiles, R C C
Chairman, about the offensive
behaviour of about a dozen
members of the Links Club,
including Jim Boucher, Guilds
Academic Affairs Officer, and
Steve Bishop, last year's Guilds
President. The Executive met last
Friday to consider the complaint,
and decided merely to write to the
students concerned expressing
the hope that such incidents
would not be repeated.
The incident took place on
Thursday 24 May shortly before
closing time when the group of
students entered the bar. It was
clear they had already been
drinking for some time. They
proceeded to chant phrases such'
as 'no women in the bar' and 'get
your tits out, girls'. This caused
considerable embarrassment to
the five women present in the bar.
In a letter to the Executive
Miss Love said she felt that it was
intolerable that 'individuals
ritually harass women who are
enjoying their right and privilege,
as members of IC Union to drink
in the Union Bar.' She also went
on to say that she did not object
to the singing of bawdy rugby
songs since these songs, although
crude, only concerned fictional
characters. She felt that by
chanting 'no women in the bar' the
Links Club were insulting real
people to their faces, simply
because they are female.
The Links Club is an all male
drinking club, elected from
members of Guilds usually from
G u i l d s U n i o n . I C U n i o n
President Gaynor Lewis told
F E L I X she did not object to this
type of behaviour and did not
think it would put women off
coming to Imperial.
Badge of Honour
It was learnt this week that Roger
Serpell, a technician in the
aeronautical department, has
been awarded the Badge of
Honour of the British Red Cross
Society. The Badge is given by the
Society in recognition o f
exceptional service and carries
special significance for M r
Serpell since it's more normally
presented to retiring members.
His involvement with the
BRCS goes back twelve years but
it is during the last eight years,
whilst working as a technician in
Aero, that he has made an impact
on College life. During that time
he f o u n d e d the B R C S
Detatchment at College (of
which he is commandant), helped
to obtain the College ambulance
which was purchased with Rag
funds in 1978, and taught many
hundres of students first aid at his
regular courses.
Parsons narrowly beaten
Britain's top high jumper Geoff Parsons, a first year student in the
Mineral Technology department, narrowly failed to automatically
qualify for the Olympic Games when he was beaten by his rival Mark
Nayler at the Crystal Palace Olympic trials on Wednesday.
Although both athletes cleared the same height of 2m 22cm, the
Olympic qualifying standard, Mark Nayler won because he took fewer
attempts.
