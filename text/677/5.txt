NO BOTHA! NO APARTHEID!
This was the message that reverberated through the streets of London last
Saturday. A mass demonstration and rally ajjainst the visit of M r P W
Botha, prime minister of South Africa, was organised jointly by the Anti-
Apartheid Movement and the Greater London Council in which a number
of Imperial College students took part.
After assembling at Speakers
Corner around midday, the
demonstration set off through
the streets of London. It was
expected to be the biggest ever
response to the Apartheid regime
of South Africa. The lines of
demonstrators spread through-
out the city confronting everyone
in sight with the unified voice
"We, the people of Great Britain,
do not wish to play host to this
racist leader."
Arriving in Jubilee Gardens
for the rally, the marchers were
met by even more demonstrators
who clapped and cheered as they
arrived. Flags were waving and
banners held high. There was a
joyous sense of victory. The
warm sunshine, the pleasant
music, and the unified strength in
numbers. It took over two hours
for everyone to flow into the
Gardens and the speeches had to
begin before all had made it.

space in all newspapers, only to
be undermined by The Times who
censored their advertisements.
Messages of support and
encouragement were read out,
ranging from leading figures in
the African struggle to a young
boy who couldn't make it down
from Scotland to attend the rally.
A message from Oliver Tambo,
President of the A N C of South
Africa made a clear distinction
that summed up the whole day.
"We in the A N C have always
believed that a distinction should
be drawn between the British
government and the British
people, between those who aid
and abet the apartheid regime
and those who support our
people's struggle for freedom.
We hope the British people in a
unified and massive demonstra-
tion will disassociate themselves
from Mrs Thatcher's action and
reaffirm their abhorrence of
apartheid."
A l l the speakers agreed that
Mrs Thatcher had not invited M r
Demonstrators congregating at
Jubilee Gardens.
Botha in order to rid South
Africa of the apartheid system.
This is not the way of our 'Iron
Lady' and one speaker compared
her hospitality to that she gave
the leaders of Argentina, the
miners or the Socialist parties.
This is a lady of, in her own
words, 'no compromise'.
