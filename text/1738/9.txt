An Act of God
I
was first introduced
to An Act of God
years ago, when Jim
Parsons, best known
for playing Sheldon
Cooper on The Big Bang
Theory, was a guest
on some kind of a late
night show, promoting
the original Broadway
play-slash-stand-up-show
with him playing God
Almighty. I was curious to
see how it would come to-
gether, given the sensitive
nature of the show could
have either easily turned
into controversy, or ended
up as a complete bore if
played safe in fear of said
controversy. However,
given how often I get to
see Broadway shows in
New York (almost never),
I thought my odds of
seeing it were unlikely.
Years later, just when I
had pretty much forgotten
its existence, I found that
the show was announced
to be gearing towards its
London debut, starring
comedian Zoe Lyons
as God, with the script
updated for London audi-
ences by the original play-
wright, David Javerbaum.
Here was my chance to
go!
As I approached the
venue, I was convinced
that Google Maps had lost
its mind, making me twist
and turn into dodgy back
streets only to end up at
some kind of a dungeon
near Waterloo Station.
Turns out, I was at the
exact right place - the
aptly named ‘The Vaults’.
Upon entering the au-
ditorium, if you could call
it that, you were greeted
by a double bed facing a
bunch of chairs in what
can only be described
as a dark basement. Not
knowing what to expect
exactly, I was further
intrigued by the setting I
was thrown in.
Over 90 minutes, God
tried Her best to answer
many questions that have
plagued human existence
for millenia such as ‘why
do bad things happen to
good people?’, at times
with extreme brutality.
One of my main takea-
ways from the show was
the way humans tend
to find ways to justify
everything, however
horrible or absurd,
through God. There was
one particular line that
was very impactful, and
one which I’ve been pon-
dering upon since.
‘You are my greatest
creation, and I am your
worst.’
The updated script is
overall hilarious, touching
upon expected issues such
as the then-upcoming
general election, Brexit,
and making ample refer-
ences to pop culture, such
as Kanye’s recent, weirdly
self-centred gospel album.
The underground vibe
of the theatre helped to
set the mood, making me
feel like I was at some
sort of secret gathering.
Complete with the oc-
casional magic trick and
outbursts of God’s wrath,
An Act of God was a
smart, entertaining script
brought to life skillfully
by Zoe Lyons, and her
two Angels, Matt Tedford
and Tom Bowen.
After the collapse of man comes… jellyfish?
H
ow art in-
teracts with
and depicts
the changing
climate is pivotal to how
we think about climate
change. This is the
underlying idea of Eco-
visionaries running right
now at the RoyalAcademy
of Arts. Very much a
multimedia exhibition,
it features works from
DeepMind, AntFarm
and Olafur Eliasson (you
might have seen his art in
your instagram feed fol-
lowing his Tate Modern
exhibition earlier this
year), just to name a few.
At Eco-visionaries you
can see everything from
video compilations of
giraffes dying and ships
wrecking; architectural
archetypes that aim to
attract air pollution or
foster dolphins; to a life-
sized CGI-rendition of the
last male white rhinoceros
that ever lived. All of
these works are amazing
individually, but there’s
one that stands out of the
crowd as the absolute
showstopper. The very last
work before you exit the
exhibition is a 16-minute
long video. You can only
enter the room every 16th
minute, when the doors
open. Inside, the viewers
get their own headset and
sit down facing a mirror.
Thrust into a dystopian
narrative, you leave the
room fully believing that
jellyfish are going to
take over the world. The
film is made by Rimini
Protokoll, a group of
three German artists situ-
ated in Berlin. Normally
working with theatre, this
interactive experience
is surprisingly smoothly
executed and is, like
many theatres, dependent
on audience participation.
The narrative voice inside
your headphones will
suddenly ask you to do
slightly ridiculous and
uncomfortable things,
but please bear with it as
it makes it more fun for
everyone else.
The narrative of the
exhibition is clearly
portrayed in the art space
itself. There’s a little
introduction-pathway that
leads you into the exhibi-
tion and summarises the
interface between climate
change and art and signs
hung up around the exhi-
bition invites the visitor
to think about the art in a
certain way.
As a whole, it works,
but unfortunately, it also
isn’t enough. There are
two recurring themes;
video installations and
architectural prototypes.
You’d think that in today’s
world with climate
marches left and right,
there’d be more variety
of art to exhibit in a place
like this. The stuff that is
good is EXCELLENT,
but there isn’t that much
to see. Walking out past a
bunch of kindergarteners’
climate action posters,
you’re left with a craving
for more. Maybe if the
curators had more time,
they could have found
more artists. Perhaps
this sense of urgency is
the best climate change
analogy this exhibition
has to offer.
