W
hile you
might be
full of
excitement
about the better version
of yourself you are going
to become this year, no
one wants to hear about
your New Year’s Res-
olutions. They are shit.
Replace them with some
of our suggestions
Number 1 - Start
drinking
We all know the union
has funding problems.
We all know that we have
mental health problems.
Kill two birds with one
stone by drinking till you
forget and simultaneously
providing the union with
more revenue that can be
spent on therapists.
Number 2 – Get fat
Remember, you can’t
get called up to fight in
Iran if you are Type 2
diabetic and built like four
Hungarian shot-putters.
Then again, you might get
used as a sandbag.
Number 3 – Spend
more money
From your mangled
reading of Keynesian
thought you work out that
if you spend more money
you will end up with even
more. It’s called the mul-
tiplier effect, read a book
man.
Number 4 – Don’t call
your mum
Stop kidding yourself.
She doesn’t want to hear
from you.
Number 5 – Become
an incel
Your screenplay has
been dying to get written
and those femoids were
only holding you back.
Break the chain, focus on
science.
Number 6 – Don’t
revise
All the people that get
the best marks never do
any revision.
Number 7 - Start
vaping
You have never smoked
in your life but this is a
great time in your life to
start vaping. Just think
how good you are going
to look when all that hand
waving actually makes a
smoke ring.
Number 8 - Join a
new club
The rugby club initi-
ation is still ongoing. I
am sure they won’t mind
if you slip in at the back.
Just call everyone mate
and once you perfect your
circular drinking (drink
pint, throw up into pint,
drink pint, repeat) you
should be fine.
This year it’s time to
expand your horizons, get
more literate and embrace
the humanities. Peterson’s
12 rules for life and the
novelisation of seasons
1-3 of Rick and Morty are
Amazon primed and on
their way!
Number 10 - Teach
yourself how to cook
The union kitchen
closure forced you to do
some introspection. How
hard can it be to stick
some frozen curly fries in
a microwave?
Top Ten Resolutions to Fail at Before January 1st
This week you are Baby
Archie.
While not old enough
to walk yet you already
know that you and state
school arent going to mix
well.
This week you’re the
new Faculty of Natural
Sciences Dean.
You are immediately
dismissed over “lack
of sensible work-life
balance”
This week, you go to the
gym to “burn off the extra
Christmas pounds.”
Don’t lie to yourself.
They were there before
Christmas.
This week you watch
Cats the movie.
You castrate cats in
revenge
This week, Ryanair
charges you £50 for
being over your baggage
allowance.
You regret packing your
shitty Christmas presents.
This week you give
up alcohol, smoking,
staying up late and your
personality.
It was holding you back
anyway.
This week, you post
about your dream for a
white Christmas next
year.
You get cancelled on
Twitter.
This week you’re
suffering through exams.
You hope that you’ve
argued with enough
Americans on Facebook
to merit a drone strike on
your flat.
This week you are the
Iranian goverment.
You have Millwall away
next week and your
chants are already all
over the internet
This week, your nan
mishears you while
talking about the
Australian bushfires.
“There’s a cream for
that”, she says.
This week you actually
read Felix.
Exam procrastination has
made you desperate.
“Teach
yourself to
cook. How
hard can it be
to stick some
frozen curly
fries into a
microwave?”
