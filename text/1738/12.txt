Cyrano de Bergerac: Love
Letters to Language
The Ocean at the End of
the Lane
I had no idea of what kind
of show to expect,
Swayed to attend by media
buzz and the prospect
Of seeing James McAvoy
- live on stage!
A welcome break from his
golden age
Of threequels and reboots,
Green screens and CGI
substitutes,
Blockbuster, record-bust-
er,
So-called cinematic fili-
buster.
How glad was I to have
witnessed something so
spectacular
As a (very French) love
story told in British ver-
nacular:
Boy, Cyrano de Bergerac
(James McAvoy), a mas-
terful wordsmith,
In love with
Girl, Roxane (Anita Joy
Uwajeh), brains, beauty
and balls,
Who’s fallen for
Other boy, Christian (Eben
Figueiredo), handsome
and attractive,
Although, unfortunately,
mentally… inactive.
Might I add that Cyrano is
disfigured
With a nose so big Pinoc-
chio would be triggered.
Remarkably, with Jamie
Lloyd’s direction and
aesthetic,
Cyrano appears with no
olfactory prosthetic,
A comment, perhaps, on
self-perception –
What holds us back is
often of our own creation.
Likewise, the stage had a
minimalist air,
Devoid of props, save
some microphones and
chairs,
Turning the audience’s
sole focus on
Each line of the script, a
linguistic phenomenon.
Highest praise to Martin
Crimp, translator-adaptor,
For managing to capture
The magic of verse and
rhyme
Sorely missed from
current playwriting
paradigm.
Through vocabulary,
rhythm, accent, and meter,
Each character was
presented a fully-formed
feature.
MacAvoy shone as
tortured poet,
Brimming with talent and
not afraid to show it.
In fact, the whole cast was
absolutely stunning,
Althoughoutofallofthem
I was mostly gunning
For Nima Taleghani’s
Ligniere,
Whose cheeky demeanour
and cockneyed diction
aired
A more vulnerable trait
and delicate soul
Than the traditional
drunken-best-friend
reading of the role.
Crimp’s Cyrano de
Bergerac is a novel adap-
tation
That revels in its celebra-
tion
Of words and language
and unpitched sound
(There’s even beatboxing!
I guess “in for a penny, in
for a pound”),
Move over Hamilton,
there’s a new guy in town
Looking to take your
verbal gymnastics crown.
His name is Cyrano de
Bergerac
And he’s bringing
rhyming couplets back.
T
wo truths, one
(partial) lie: A
fighting shape-
shifting being
from the edge of the
universe, called a flea,
disguises herself as a
wonderfully helpful
lodger called Ursula and
enchants Sis and Dad.
You’re just a lonely boy
with books as your best
friends. The Hempstocks,
the three crazy women that
are your neighbours live
on magical woodlands
and coins keep appearing
ever since you touched a
fish from the Hempstocks’
pond. The world is an
inexorable chasm punctu-
ated with fantasy.
The Ocean at the End
of the Lane, based on the
novel of the same name by
Neil Gaimon and adapted
by Joel Horwood is an
extraordinary tease about
a mystical, inexplorable
childhood. After all, what
is childhood without an
indistinguishable mix of
imagination and memory.
The play is an after-
thought, a homage to
the tougher elements of
growing up: reckoning
with death and loss. The
protagonist, imaginatively
named The Boy, saddened
by the news of his father’s
death comes back to his
hometown and ponders
about his childhood, par-
ticularly his 12th birthday
when he first saw a dead
person. And this begins a
leapfrogging process from
the past (1988, to be exact)
to present, as peace is
made with an imaginative
version of the past. Adult
Boy is the spitting image
of his dad (Adult Boy and
dad played by the talented
Justin Salinger), both who
were troubled by familial
tensions when The Boy’s
mother died.
For comfort, benches
appear for the despaired to
ruse on. Moments of panic
and chaos are augmented
by doors which only lead
back to the same place and
the hair-raising, lunging
beasts from the Edge are
a staggering puppetry
performance which wreak
a rhythmic havoc onstage.
Whether the crepuscular
lighting for a transient
escape, or a ravaged dead
body discovered in a car,
there is a continuous jump
from the normal to har-
rowing fantasy. Puppetry
Director, Finn Caldwell
and Costume and Puppet
Designer, Samuel Wyer
(both involved in notable
works such as War Horse
and Wizard of Oz pre-
viously) have created a
wonderfully splendid set
wiled out of imagination.
The acting is powerful
and clearly well-re-
hearsed. Despite a few
unsmooth exits, the show
ran seamlessly, testament
to great teamwork. The
witty humour of the
Hempstocks coupled
with their eccentricity
are a source of continual
amusement in this action
filled monster fest of a
play.
The Ocean at the End
of the Lane is one of Neil
Gaimon’s most autobio-
graphical book. I left the
Dorfman 2.5 hours later
wondering what a trau-
matic childhood he must
have had.
