I Think it’s Lie Time for some Polygraphs

P
revious research
has indicated that
the success of a
lie is held in the
prowess of the liar, rather
than the gullibility of
their audience. A recent
study led by Dr. Brianna
Verigin at the University
of Portsmouth has at-
tempted to ascertain who
the “good” liars are, how
they lie and why they are
successful.
A “good” liar might seem
somewhat oxymoronic.
However, for Dr. Verigin
and colleagues, they are
someone who can success-
fully deceive, so that “the
intended false-belief has
been produced” in their
audience. The researchers
conducted a survey of 194
people (mean age = 39,
with a 1:1 self-identifying
male:female ratio), in
which each participant
self-reported their 1) basic
personal information 2)
lie frequency 3) deception
strategies and 4) ability
to deceive successfully.
Using this final criterion,
the sample population was
categorised into “poor” (n
= 51), “neutral” (n = 75)
and “good” liars (n = 68).
From this dataset, the
researchers found that
“good” liars were twice
as likely to be men than
women, with men repre-
senting roughly two thirds
of “good” liars. “Good”
liars also lied more fre-
quently than poorer liars,
and therefore may be
responsible for a dispro-
portionate number of lies
told in daily life. Previous
studies have indicated that
on average people lie at
least once per day. These
recent findings from Dr.
Verigin and her team
support the idea that the
subset of the population
who are more proficient
liars (the “good” liars of
this study) are driving up
this average and that not
all people lie every day.
In the case of this sample,
the majority of lies were
reported by only 40%
of the tested population.
Astoundingly, the six
most prolific liars (less
than 1% of the sample),
accounted for 38.5% of
the lies, meanwhile 76
participants (39% of the
sample) reported telling
no lies at all. The nature
of the most common lies
from those marked as
“good” liars are inconse-
quential, or ‘white’ lies,
predominantly to friends
and colleagues (rather
than to employers or fig-
ures of authority).
So, how are good liars
successful? In this study
“good” liars reported a
preference for lying face-
to-face, and they succeed
by keeping their lies clear,
simple and intertwined
with threads of truth.
However, it is noted that
the self-reporting nature
of the data collection is a
shortfall of this study, and
that more research needs
to be done, to look further
into “good” liars’ability to
embed lies within truthful
information. Anyway, in
the meantime, I wish you
the best of luck re: con-
vincing your housemates
you didn’t finish off the
holiday snacks!
Researchers from the University of Portsmouth have discovered that self-reported “good” liars are (among
other things) twice as likely to be men than women.
