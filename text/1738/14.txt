Little Women (2019)
A review of Greta Gerwig’s recent adaptation of the much loved American classic, Little Women
L
ittle Women is a
classic piece of
American liter-
ature. This is all
I knew of Little Women’s
story walking into the
cinema on Boxing Day,
but despite this, I couldn’t
help but be enticed by
the strong cast (notably
Timothée Chalamet) and
director. By the time I left
I knew I wanted to know
more.
Published in 1869,
“Starring
Ronan, Watson
and Chalamet,
Little Women’s
cast is enough
to turn any
Hollywood
producer
green with
envy”
with the civil war fresh
in public memory and the
industrial revolution in
full swing, Little Women
warmed hearts, telling
the story of four eccentric
sisters, as they grew
from girls into (little)
women. Heavily inspired
by Louisa May Alcott’s
childhood, it’s pages brim
with tales of misadven-
ture, love and family. One
cannot help but feel that
to many readers, Little
Women offered a glimpse
of country life’s rosy
twilight, as an increasing
number of Americans
emigrated to cities.
Greta Gerwig’s inter-
pretation frames these
poles of urbane adulthood
and provincial infancy
more sharply by chopping
up Little Women’s
timeline. The audience is
thrown between two nar-
ratives at will, à la Pulp
Fiction. This effectively
heightens the film’s emo-
tional potency, drawing
out bittersweet pangs as
we cut from an adult Jo
(Saoirse Ronan) wrestling
with mortality and indi-
viduality, to an endearing
March family ‘play’.
Much of the film,
focusing on country life,
is framed with warm
pallets and snug camera
work, literally enveloping
the viewer in the family
goings on of the Little
Women. The result is a
satisfying and pleasant
cinematic experience,
that comforts rather than
challenges.
Standout cine-
matographic moments
come in twin beach
scenes: one sees the sisters
and friends frolicking on a
warm summer’s day, the
camera wonders loosely,
like the sea birds it traces.
The other depicts Beth
(Eliza Scanlen) strug-
gling with scarlet fever
complications, her figure
distant against sheer white
sands and skies, creating a
muted, bleak moment.
Alexandre Desplat
takes responsibility for
Little Women’s music, a
somewhat safe choice,
given his credentials: The
Shape of Water, Argo, The
Grand Budapest Hotel,
and even the final Harry
Potter feature his deft
compositional hand. This
was in fact the first film
whose score I enjoyed so
much I actually sought it
out for repeat listening.
While removed from its
cinematic context, the
composition is perhaps
more quaint than awe
inspiring, it succeeded in
enhancing my experience.
Little Women’s cast
is enough to turn any
Hollywood producer
green with envy, while
Emma Watson (Meg)
and Timothée Chalamet
(Laurie) provide strong
support, it is the crackling
sibling rivalry delivered
by Saorise Ronan (Jo)
and Florence Pugh (Amy)
which really sparkles.
With by far the meatiest
story arcs, packed with
conflict, sacrifice and
beyond that, passion,
Amy and Jo are incredibly
sympathetic, their actors
breathing life into the
whole March family.
Greta Gerwig’s inter-
pretation of Little Women
is well worth a watch
if you haven’t already,
and for any viewers
who have read this far,
perhaps a second. All the
ingredients of a great film
are here, and while it will
not revolutionise the film
industry, Little Women
will warm your heart, the
perfect tonic for exam
season.
