dence for Impe-
rial’s Grantham
Institute for Climate
Change and Environ-
ment, Áinne Burke,
presented an exhibition
in the College’s main
entrance between the
6th and 8th of January.
The exhibition was
comprised of four cloaks
constructed from litter,
sourced from street
sweepers across London,
and highlighted the value
of engaging in sustain-
able practices – such as
recycling and decreasing
usage of disposable pack-
aging.
Specifically, they were
made of coffee cups, cans,
plastic bottles, and crisp
packets – all of which are
heavily under-recycled
materials. The cloaks
were displayed alongside
facts about the materials
the litter is comprised of
– plastics such as polyeth-
ylene terephthalate, paper,
and aluminium.
The cloaks were pre-
viously worn to the Lord
Mayor’s Show on 9th
No-
vember, at which the new
Lord Mayor is sworn in
each year. The procession
through the city features
floats and marches from
military detachments,
schools, companies, and
other institutions. Áinne
was invited to join the City
of London Corporation’s
Recycling in the City
float, at which she wore a
previous piece – the ‘Earth
Gown’, constructed from
cling film, polystyrene,
bubble wrap, and other re-
cyclable materials – while
others who had worked
with her wore the four
cloaks. The nature of the
event inspired the choice
to develop ceremonial
cloaks, Áinne says.
Each piece was made
using the certified cra-
dle-to-cradle method,
which approaches the
design process by model-
ling the used materials as
nutrients circulating in a
healthy metabolism. The
method encourages indus-
try and product creation to
protect and enrich ecosys-
tems in their processes,
fitting with the thematic
of the cloaks themselves.
On this methodology,
Áinne said “I feel this
certification should be
mandatory for all design.
Each of the four cloaks
is a story of a product of
many companies – flatten-
ing the 250 tin cans with
a five-kilogramme weight
felt as though I was part
of the destruction of the
manufacturing process,
to tell the story of its
way from the street to the
grave.”
The exhibition was
part of The Earth and Me
(TEAM) project Áinne
has developed alongside
the Institute, which aims
to combine visual art
with a scientific aspect –
namely the chemistry of
the periodic table and the
elements – to emphasise
humanity’s relationship
with the earth and how to
better care for it.
The project looks at
the 92 natural chemical
elements contained in the

biomes of the land, air,
and water of the Earth,
64 of which are also
contained in the human
body, and uses art and
science to educate and
raise awareness of that
relationship and the (im)
balances between each
element – for example, an
imbalance of cadmium as
it's overloaded into water
causes the itai-itai disease.
Thus far, TEAM has
created a periodic table
using the colours of ores,
using specimens online,
known as the TEAM
Periodic Table, which will
then be matched to specif-
ic pigments in February to
create the TEAM Pigment
Palette of the Periodic
Table. Áinne then plans
to create 92 paintings, one
for each natural chemical
element, using art to com-
municate the science and
the relationship between
those 92 and the 64 com-
prising the human body.
As she puts it: “when you
pollute land, air, and water
through human activity,
we pollute ourselves!”
Felix will follow up
with an interview with
Áinne in next week’s issue.

Rent Negotiations
As a brief recap: every
five years, the Union and
College negotiate the rent
price in halls. This year,
the College proposed a
model they described
as “break-even”, which
would see a 12.2% overall
increase in the price of
halls. The Union Council
voted to reject this model,
disputing both the steep
increase and whether the
model counted as “break-
even” given that new
costs were included and
the value of the asset was
not taken into account.
Since this decision, the
Union has continued to
meet with the College’s
Campus Services division
under whose remit this
discussion falls. The
Union President has said
that Campus Services had
been very open-minded
in their discussions, and
helpful in providing infor-
mation when requested.
As of yet, no further deci-
sions have been made.
Ethical Investment
As a brief recap: the
College was revealed in
2017/18 to have several
million pounds invested in
companies with dubious
ethical track records,
such as fossil fuels,
arms, and pharmaceutical
companies. There has
been a growing pressure
for the College to assess
its investment portfolio
and account for ethical
concerns. This culminated
with the submission – and
passing – of an ethical in-
vestment paper at College
Council, written by the
Union President, the
Deputy President (Finance
and Services), and the
Ethics and Environment
Officer, which sought to
establish a working group
to investigate.
The Socially Respon-
sible Investment (SRI)
Policy Working Group set
up as a result of the paper
has met twice already this
term, working at a fast
pace due to the short turn-
around time on feeding
back findings to College
Council – which are due
in mid-February.
They are in the process
of consulting with various
experts in the areas of
climate and investment
policy. The group will
also be assessing the
impact of investing into
other areas, such as arms,
or pharmaceuticals. They
are also accepting sub-
missions from the College
community, which can be
submitted at sri.policy@
imperial.ac.uk, before the
31st
of January.
