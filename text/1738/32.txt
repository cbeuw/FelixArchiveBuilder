December was
no ordinary day
for the Imperial
College Immortals. It was
not only a chance for pay-
back against our rivals,
but the last game the
Immortals would play in
the decade. The rematch
against the Kent Falcons
is always a big game in
the season for the team
as it sets the tone for the
second half, and the team
were as ready as ever for
the upcoming challenge.
Fortunately, any spirit
that the team was lacking
was strongly supported by
the ever-dedicated cheer-
leaders, who managed to
field a season’s best of 2
supporters to the match.
With the players
holding several injuries
from previous matches,
it was a slow start to the
game. The team were
quickly 14-0 down and
it was beginning to look
like the same old story…
However, a quick play by
Rookie Quarterback Alex
“Golden Arm” Moran saw
the immortals attain their
first touchdown followed
by a two-point conversion
leaving the score 14-8.
Kent didn’t know what hit
them next as an impres-
sive run by David “F**k
Cheer” Cobbinah saw the
score being levelled to 14
all at half time.
The team has struggled
in the season thus far to
remain motivated and
see off the game, but this
was going to be no such
day. Despite the Falcons
scoring early, the team
were quick to reply and
Ben “Ex QB2” O’Brien
showing his skills at
receiver scored a touch-
down leaving the game at
21-20. But the Immortals
would not stop there,
with all the momentum
safety Anuj “It was fake”
Mehra managed to catch
an incredibly difficult
interception… and lost
the team 20 yards in the
process. However, this
interception began a drive
which allowed Grummers
“OC 2020” Grummers to
score putting the squad in
the lead for the first time
in the match.
Kent however, were
not impressed and quickly
regained the lead putting
the score at 28-26 with
only precious minutes to
go. It was a tough battle,
but Ben O’Brien’s red
jeans distracted Kent
for long enough for him
to score, successfully
securing Alex Moran’s
QB 1 spot in the process.
With only seconds to go
the confused Falcons side
didn’t know what had hit
them and the Immortals
regained the ball on an
onside kick. As the clock
ran down the team took
the knee and secured the
first Victory of the season.
The final score came
to 32-28 to the Immor-
tals. It was an incredible
game, and every one
of the players played
their heart out, however
the team would like to
congratulate the MVPs,
Offensive Rookie: David
Cobbinah, Defensive
Rookie: Riccardo “Ga-
roppolo” Valperga. D-
Line: Grummers “Who’s
Daniel” Grumberg,
Offensive: Ben O’Brien,
Defensive: Marcin “Kit
Sec 2020” Olesinski,
Overall: Alex Moran. The
Team celebrated the well-
earned victory, however
even on the one-year an-
niversary, it was decided
that for budget reasons
that they could not Buy
