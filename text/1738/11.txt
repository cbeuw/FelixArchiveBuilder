A Christmas Carol
T
his ‘musical play’
is an original
adaptation of a
well-known and
loved novella, thanks to
the fresh use of music and
direction. The use of car-
ol-singing and handbell
performances to break up
the well-known narrative
play a role in creating a
Christmassy and joyful
environment on stage, but
it is not used as a major
component of story-tell-
ing as in a musical.
The ambience through-
out the play was the most
remarkable component of
the production. Before the
performance had started
actors located around the
auditorium interacted with
the public, handing out
mince pies and oranges.
During the play fake snow
would also fall over the
music.
As the production was
intended for adults and
children, it was fun and
creative. They rolled
vegetables and fruit down
from the Dress Circle seats
onto the stage using sheets
and railed a roast chicken
across the stage, creating
festive feelings. This was
all made possible by the
imaginative utilisation of
the cross-shaped stage.
However, changes in
mood as the plot develops
were often jarring, es-
pecially in the transition
from the Ghost of Christ-
mas Yet-to-Come’s visit
to the joyous Christmas
Day celebrations. The
turn in Scrooge’s attitude
was also overacted. The
performance by Paterson
Joseph made him come
across mad, which did not
emphasise the happiness
in the last scenes but
rather made it strange and
reckless. A less abrupt
change would have felt
more natural. In general,
most of the performances
seemed slightly too
intense.
Nevertheless, the play
was still a good reminder
of the kindness, love and

audience and, in a certain
scene, even a boy from the
audience joined the stage.
This execution made it
seem as if we were part of
the town with a secondary
role in the play. Accompa-
nying this atmosphere of
inclusiveness was a heart-
warming feeling created
by the lanterns hanging
from the ceiling and the
generosity Christmas
promotes. As reiterated
by Scrooge in the play,
“Christmas time is a good
time; kind, forgiving,
charitable, pleasant time”.
Though the feeling of
gratefulness was present,
it did not do the book
justice.
