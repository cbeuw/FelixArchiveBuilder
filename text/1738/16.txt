Sony Vision-S
T
he company that
brought you
the Walkman,
P l a y S t a t i o n ,
and a number of other
popular electronics
gadgets has now entered
the vehicle industry. As
much as it’s surprising,
Sony indeed showcased
its vision for “future
concepts in the area of
mobility” by unveiling its
prototype car — Vision
S. The car, which focuses
heavily on safety, has a
whopping thirty three
automotive grade sensors.
In addition, the car has
an interesting safety
feature that uses sensors
to monitor the driver’s
facial expressions and
body movement to assess
their concentration level;
this allows the system
to alert the driver when
they’re being distracted.
Another feature of this
system is to assess the
overall emotional mood
in the cabin and adjust the
temperature, thus helping
passengers feel comforta-
ble. On the entertainment
side, the car features a
panoramic screen that
stretches all the way
updates. Sony’s vision of
safety, entertainment, and
adaptability does indeed
give us a more realistic
glimpse of what the future
of transport could hold
over the next decade.
Samsung Odyssey G9
Samsung has proved its
mastery of curved displays
with its new Odyssey
G9, a massive (and not
to mention extreme) 49”
1440p curved gaming
monitor that boasts a
buttery-smooth 240 Hz
panel. It’s hard to com-
prehend it’s size unless
you’re sitting in front of
it. To give you an idea,
it envelops your entire
horizontal field of vision!
To put it in a bit more per-
spective, it’s like having
a dual monitor setup
without an interfering
bezel in the middle. With
such extreme specifica-
tions, don’t expect this
monitor to be cheap, and
to make use of its full po-
tential, you’ll need quite a
beefy gaming rig.
OnePlus Concept One
OnePlus unveiled a
new concept phone at
the consumer electronics
show (CES) that features
a disappearing camera
module. The phone,
like many concept cars,
showcases the company’s
potential and ability to
experiment with newer
technologies and ideas.
In this case, OnePlus
used electrochroamatic
glass to cover the camera
module, so when the
camera isn’t being used,
the glass turns opaque and
vice versa. Also, this new
layer acts as an ND filter
when toggled through
the camera app. An ND
filter essentially helps
reduce the amount of light
entering the sensor when
shooting in bright con-
ditions. OnePlus hasn’t
stated whether this tech
would make its way into
its upcoming smartphone
lineup, but it’s neverthe-
less an interesting idea.
Alienware Concept
UFO
Alienware showed off
an unexpected prototype
that merges handheld
portability with the game
selection that a PC has to
offer. Meet the Concept
UFO - an aggressive,
angular looking Nintendo
Switch that runs on a
version of Windows 10.
For the demo, the device
ran Rocket League,
Mortal Kombat 11, and F1
2019, and players reported
a smooth and lag-free
gaming experience. Now,
you might be wondering
what powers this tiny
Dell Concept Ori &
Concept Duet
Foldable laptops
are now slowly taking
shape. Last year, we saw
Microsoft’s Surface Neo,
a foldable, dual screen
device. This year, Dell
is showing off two of its
latest prototypes: Concept
Ori and Concept Duet.
Concept Ori follows
along Lenovo’s foldable
PC prototype (unveiled
last year) and features a
continuous, foldable 13”
screen that’s QHD+. The
other prototype, Concept
Duet, follows Microsoft’s
approach by mounting two
displays together through
a hinge mechanism. This
device is essentially an
XPS 13” 2-in-1 where the
lower keyboard deck is
replaced with a second-
ary display. Again, just
like other concepts, Dell
hasn’t commented on
whether these prototypes
would soon take shape
in the consumer market.
Though, with Microsoft
adapting Windows for
foldable and dual screen
devices with Windows
10X, the place for these
devices in our near future
is guaranteed.
“Sensors to
monitor the
driver’s facial
expressions
and body
movements”
across the dashboard
and a 360 degree im-
mersive audio system
that’s integrated into
the seat and other parts
of the car. Furthermore,
just like a Tesla, this
car would adapt to the
future through regular

“It envelops
your entire
horizontal
field of vision”
monster. Well, Alienware
refused to comment on
the internal specifications
of the device. Further-
more, there was no say
on if or when this product
would hit the market.
With 5G connectivity and
game streaming services
slowly propping up on
the horizon, it’s only a
matter of time before we
see the evolution of both
on-the-go as well as PC
gaming.
