Midsummer in Midwinter
Wolf of Wall Street - an
attempt at high-octane fun
burns out quickly
F
or those unfamil-
iar with the plot,
A Midsummer
Night’s Dream is
a classic Shakespearean
comedy. In this adaptation
by the National Youth
Theatre (NYT), several
changes to the plot and
setting have been made.
The most obvious setting
change was that instead of
the traditional Athens of
Ancient Greece, the NYT
version was set in the
slightly more run-down
Athens-on-Sea, a stereo-
typical seaside town, gone
to the dogs over years
of neglect. The scene
was set with a hilarious
modern introduction of a
son harassing his mother
for ice cream on the
beach. However, this brief
dalliance with modernity
seemed no more than an
afterthought as the rest of
the story was carried out
entirely in Shakespearean
English.
Straight from the off,
an atypical choice was
to cast Helena, usually
a female role, as a man.
Jamie Foulkes was a con-
vincing Helena who had
clear chemistry with the
other three lovers of the
tangled love quadrangle -
Lysander, Demetrius and
Hermia. Oberon and Puck
lurked in the background
of the play. Bede Hodg-
kinson convinced as the
authoritative fairy king,
ordering his minion this
way and that. I am afraid
thatPuckinthisadaptation
left a little to be desired.
As opposed to the usual
mischievous knave that
delights in the trickery of
the night, this Puck (Ella
Dacres) seemed to resent
the orders from on high
to sow discord against the
Fairy Queen and the Athe-
nians. Her serious manner
was incongruent with the
light-hearted nature of
the rest of the production.
Speaking of jarring, the
cast regularly broke
into well-choreographed
dance, accompanied
by rhythmic thumping
music. Although I have
no objection to the inclu-
sion of dance in a play,
the music was often so
loud that it and obscured
dialogue, not to mention
the tendency of the dance
segments to suddenly
appear without warning.
A key part of any
successful Midsummer
Night’s Dream hinges on
the casting of Bottom. The
deluded egomaniac that
makes Bottom so much
fun to watch, as well as,
I imagine, play, was
wonderfully embodied by
Jemima Mayala. The rest
of the of the Athenian
Actors Guild were classi-
cally comic. I have never
before seen such a well-
built and smooth-moving
Wall as that provided by
Jordan Ford Silver.
Overall, I feel that this
was a fresh, modern and
well-executed adaptation.
If only they had provided
a more playful Puck and
danced a little less, I
would have enjoyed it a
lot more.
T
he Wolf of Wall
Street is the latest
immersive offer-
ing from director
Alexander Wright, based
on the 2013 film about
unscrupulous stockbroker
Jordan Belfort. The prem-
ise is that we, the audience,
are all new employees at
Belfort’s cash-swindling
firm Stratton Oakmont.
Right from the off,
we’re told to pledge
allegiance to Belfort by
dropping to our knees,
thumping our chests and
chanting “Jordan f**ck-
ing Belfort!”. Party music
blares as fake £100 notes
rain from the ceiling. Then
the FBI comes on a raid,
and we hastily skedaddle.
It’s all very exciting
at first, and the maze of
different rooms at the
specially-designed venue
give a satisfying sense
of being transported
between locations as one
moves around. Once the
initial novelty wears off,
however, what promises
to be a high-powered
evening of entertainment
quickly fizzles out.
The actors do their best,
slipping into multiple
roles and accents to
maintain momentum.
Unfortunately, they’re all
one-dimensional carica-
tures, a casualty of seeing
only brief interactions as
we’re herded from one
scene to the next. Oliver
Tilney (Jordan Belfort)
makes a cartoon-worthy
stockbroker gone bad, and
actress MJ Lee impressed
if only with the sheer
number of different roles
she took on. The dialogue,
which starts up like Punch
and Judy once we crowd
into each room, feels
wooden and we have little
agency to deviate from
our predetermined path.
Despite the scripted bits
of audience interaction –
stuffing money into duffel
bags, smuggling pills
in condoms – it fails to
engage.
Even our presence in
the show is questionable.
As newly-hired employ-
ees, it makes little sense
for us to be flown en
masse to Geneva for Bel-
mont’s business meeting,
and all pretence of realism
is dropped when we
inexplicably end up in
Belmont’s family home
witnessing his domestic
argument with his wife.
The darker themes of the
play were completely
undercut by the audience
– the wild card of immer-
sive theatre. It was hard
to concentrate on Stratton
taking an overdose with
tipsy, giggly City workers
horsing around behind
him, and the dismal image
of Stratton’s wife sitting
alone on the stairs was
cheapened by people
tittering at her as they
walked by.
When you think about
it, what is the point of
turning the drug- and
fraud-fuelled world of
Stratton Oakmont into an
immersive experience?
Despite the show depict-
ing domestic violence
and an account of Belfort
sexually assaulting an
air stewardess, there is
little point in pretending
that this is a moral tale of
warning. Rather, for £60
a pop, the show enables
attendees to revel in the
chance to say “f**ck
the poor” and “it’s too
f**cking easy to get away
with sexual assault if
you’re rich”. Oh, but iron-
ically of course, because
it’s in-character! At its
core, the glorification of
Belfort’s ill-gotten, lavish
lifestyle leaves a bad taste
in the mouth.
