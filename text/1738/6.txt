Iraqi Revolution Against the Norms of Society
The prime minister has resigned, but protests in Iraq continue. Women are increasingly demanding their rights.
Will there be a social turning point in this patriarchal country?
T
he demonstrators
in Iraq have
won an impor-
tant battle. On
December 1st, the Iraqi
Parliament accepted
Prime Minister Adil
Abdul-Mahdi’s resig-
nation. A key demand
of the demonstrators
was fulfilled. The head
of the government, who
wanted to brutally crush
the current Iraqi uprising,
was gone. However, this
has not ended the wave
of protests that have now
reached their 68th day.
The people who have
been taking to the streets
in Iraq since October 1st
are demanding more than
just the resignation and re-
placement of politicians.
They want something
fundamental to change in
their country. Not only po-
litically, but also socially
and culturally. There
are a striking number of
women, young and old,
who are supporting this
movement and making it
exceptional.
Never before in the
history of Iraq, have
women raised their voices
so openly. Women play a
key role in the protests.
Hundreds of thousands
have joined the rallies in
the capital, Baghdad, and
other Iraqi cities. Photos
of women who have
wrapped the Iraqi flag
around their heads like a
veil or thrown it over their
shoulders are circulating
on social media platforms.
The female protesters are
at the forefront of the
protests, but their role in
the background is at least
as important.
Female doctors have
joined the uprising to vol-
untarily treat the protesters
wounded by government
security forces. Despite
the security crackdown,
a significant number of
women have sided with
their fellow countryman
to help make the protests
succeed. Cooking and
baking took place in
stations set up in Tahrir
Square, the makeshift
epicentre of the protests
in Baghdad. Hospitals and
medical practices have
provided healthcare to
the protesters. In a tunnel
under the square, artists
have painted wall murals.
In the evening, candles
are lit to commemorate
the dead.
“We need to get rid
of the idea that it is not
right for women to par-
ticipate in everything,”
Shaima, who joined the
rally in Baghdad with
her daughter, sisters and
nieces, told The National.
“Women must participate
in everything. If women
were in the government, it
would be even better.”

mostly shaped by Islamic
conservative and patriar-
chal norms. Men have the
say in both politics and
society. Women are often
marginalised. “Unfortu-
nately, we have traditions
that have held us back,”
said Shaima. “And even
if women do not demon-
strate, you can see them
standing at their door for
moral support. It is the
first time that something
like this has happened in
modern-day Iraq.”
In previous waves of
protests there were hardly
any female demonstra-
tors: now the young men
in Baghdad are accepting
that women are an essen-
tial part of the movement.
Like men, they are risking
their lives too. “All the
women here know that
they can die at any time,”
activist Haneen Ghranem
told The Independent. The
exact number of female
demonstrators that have
been killed in the protests
so far is unknown, but
there have always been
reports of women being
kidnapped on the side-
lines of the protests.

women of this movement.
Many believe that her
case along with the other
kidnappings and deaths
have only motivated more
women to join the demon-
strations as they no longer
see violence as a restraint
for the pursuit of a new
Iraq.
Some are already
speaking of a turning point
for the role of women in
the Iraqi society. “We
are the generation of the
future,” stated 20-year-old
student Haneen to The In-
dependent. “As children,
we lived through the fall
of the Saddam regime and
its aftermath. As teens, we
lived through terrorism
and ISIS. As a youth, we
have been living through
failed governments,
stealing our rights. The
time has come for us to
speak out.”
Baghdad’s Tahrir
square – epicentre of the
anti-government protests
In the capital, Baghdad,
representatives of polit-
ical parties have met to
discuss the formation of
a new government to put
an end to the ongoing
violence in the country.
Following the resignation
of Abdul-Mahdi, the par-
liamentary group leaders
discussed the draft of a
new electoral law to make
the Parliament younger
and more representative
and appealing to the pro-
testing youth. So far, more
than 1,000 protestors are
reported to have been
killed, and around 25,000
others have been injured.
The protests are showing
no signs of stopping.

The best-known case
was that of Saba al-Mah-
dawi, a young doctor from
Baghdad who helped the
wounded and distributed
food on the frontlines.
The doctor was gone for
eleven days after armed
men dragged her out of
her car. She was released
earlier this month. Ac-
cording to her family, she
was held in a house and
was repeatedly questioned
and interrogated.
If the goal of such
attacks was to intimidate
and prevent other women
from taking part in the
protests, then they have
