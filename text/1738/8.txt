S
o for those of you
who have not seen
it yet, let me briefly
describe a speech
recently given by the lead
actor for Borat and The
Dictator, Sacha Baron
Cohen. He gave a speech
at an Anti Defamation
League dinner, emploring
Facebook and Twitter to
censor its content even
further than presently. He
cites surging hate crimes
as evidence that social
media is taking us away
from the good old days
without social media,
where there was very
little hate crime, with
the exception of the odd
Holocaust, lynching and
World War.
So without going over-
board on the mockery,
because I’m certain to
lose that battle with a man
who is admittedly a fine
comedian, let’s get into the
authoritarian bits of the
speech which I take issue
with. Sacha says that his
proposals are ‘not limiting
free speech’ because
Facebook and Twitter are
private companies and
the first amendment only
prevents governments
from infringing on free
speech. This is valid, were
it not for a point later in
his speech where Sacha
pleads to ‘let our elected
representatives … have at
least some say’. Does that
sound like the government
to you? There are very
good reasons why the
government should not
infringe on free speech,
and it is regrettable that
the British government
does not hold this right
in so high a regard as
the Americans. Allowing
governments to take
effectively in the past, is
not a recipe for liberation,
rather a path to unlicensed
authoritarianism. Let’s not
forget that governments,
i.e. the embodiment of
majority rule, frequently
exalt the wrong ‘facts’ as
indisputable. WMDs in
Iraq, Slavery in Empires,
Economic Denial in 1929,
Fascism in the early 20th
Century: all government
sanctioned actions based
on the accepted truth at
the time. People should be
allowed to argue with the
state backed truth; who
knows, it might turn out
that Jeffrey Epstein didn’t
strangle himself with thin
air?
He reckons it would be
pretty simple for Twitter
to implement an algorithm
to filter out the ‘racists’
and ‘homophobes’ with
the only downside being
that ‘it would eject some
prominent politicians’.
He goes on to say ‘maybe
that wouldn’t be such a
bad thing’. Aside from
the dystopian reality of
elected officials passing
legislation to force social
media to ban other elected
officials, Baron Cohen
misses one unfortunate
point. Does he think that
these algorithms will be
able to determine that his
joke song ‘throw the Jews
down the well’ is in fact
sides of ‘whether the
Holocaust happened or
not’ are not equally valid.
That is a truth that he, I
and most other people
share. But to close off
public discourse for those
who are provably wrong
simply pushes them back
to their living room racism
where no-one can see it
until it is too late. I want
my racists out in the open,
where they can be heckled
and proven wrong. I ask
Sacha, and anyone else
who might think to lobby
for more censorship, to
reconsider, and think
whether they really want
to live in a world where
every meme on Facebook

“Allowing
governments
to take
control of the
narrative is
not a recipe of
liberation”
a joke? If so, how confi-
dent? If he made a million
similar jokes a day, which
is certainly far fewer than
appear on Facebook and
Twitter currently, would
he be confident that he
wouldn’t get banned at
least a thousand times
over? This hypocrisy is
stunning, and illustrates
the problem with begging
for authoritarian control.
To reproduce the entirety
of ‘First they came’ is
tempting in this situation,
but I shall refrain and
simply ask you to look it
up if you have not already
come across it.
Baron Cohen is right,
of course, that the two
control of the narrative,
as they have done so
has been fact-checked by
Aunt Algorithm like some
boring, sanitised BBC
article on sleeping pills
and where blatant jokes
are met with censorship.
And if you do want to live
in a world like that, just
don’t look at Facebook
and Reddit. Go read the
Thomson Reuters ticker to
get factual, quantitative,
boring bloody data on the
news of the day.
