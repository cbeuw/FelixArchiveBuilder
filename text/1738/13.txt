Heavy is the Head: It’s ok... I guess?
R
ising from
the UK’s
criminally un-
derappreciated
grime scene with his
Wicked Skengman free-
style series in 2014,
Stormzy was one of my,
and many of my peer’s,
first introductions to
Grime. Lyrically excellent
and with a friendly charm,
Stormzy was a breath of
fresh air in London’s dark
take on rap. With drill
music, and associated
killings peppering the
news, and knife crime at
a high, Stormzy’s positive
outlook, more present
here than ever is much
needed.
His first record, Gang
Sings and Prayer, was the
first Grime album to top
the UK charts, winning
critical acclaim and a
Brit award for best UK
album to boot, to say it is
a hard act to follow is an
understatement. Pressure
at #Merky Records
must have eased then,
when ‘Vossi Bop’, his
2nd record’s lead single
became the rapper’s first
to reach #1 on the UK
singles chart, with more
streams first week than
any other rapper in the
UK’s history. The track
showcased much of what
had taken Stormzy this
far, namely a relaxation
of Grime’s syncopated
sensibilities, in favour of
more conventional and
importantly danceable
grooves, while retaining
the flexible, rhythmically
engaging flow and British
wit which keeps fans of
the genre coming back.
How could ‘Vossi Bop’
not have been a hit?
Allegedly, in a private
listening Ed Sheeran,
pop sovereign, advised
Stormzy as much.
Merky’s lyrical skills
are not wasted on idle
boasts on Heavy is the
Head. Well, mostly not,
his brags instead take
the Kendrick Lamar
route, focusing on facts,
his achievements which
place him a cut above his
“competitors”, (and in the
process of course, earning
him the crown that weighs
upon him so heavy) this
colour isn’t the most
flattering, but Stormzy
is more than entitled to a
degree of snobbery.
Stormzy’s writing is
warranting of criticism
here, certainly, many great
records have less techni-
cal flows, compensating
with intelligent rhymes
and witty wordplay, little
of this compensation
is apparent on H.I.T.H.
Instead, the listener is
met with lacklustre, one
syllable rhyme schemes
“smoke/close/toke/coat/
adults/boat/GOAT/Dope/
Hulk/Broke”, with middle
of the road instrumentals
and decent flows, the LP’s
‘hardest’ tracks come to
less than the sum of their
parts, but are by no means
poor.
On other tracks,
Stormzy takes us behind
the throne of grime, ex-
amining the struggles and
impossible expectations
that accompany modern
celebrity, his mental health
and the community he
came from. These softer,
distinctly more melodic
tracks deliver well when
backed by detail, like
‘Superheroes’’ sample of
children’s TV show Tracy
Beaker, which adorns the
track with nostalgia very
well. ‘Rachel’s Little
Brother’ and ‘Do better’
however, lack the visceral
vulnerability that would
allow them to hit their
mark.
Instrumentals follow
the same trend: simple,
danceable, but with
barely enough spice to
distinguish them from US
consumer-grade beats.
There is no doubt that
they will land the album
much popularity, tracks
like ‘Big Michael’, ‘Pop
Boy’ and ‘Lessons’ are
eminently listenable but
achieve this by sacrificing
some of what would merit
more sincere appreciation
or praise.
Heavy is the Head, is
far from a bad album, but
there is little that could
pit it against classics of
the genre like Boy in the
Corner and Playtime is
Over or even more recent
works like Grey Area,
Nothing Great About
Britain and Integrity,
which readers are advised
to listen to instead of this.

Z
eñel is a south
London based
jazz trio, in-

more spacious, brass driv-
en sound, forged by leg-
ends like Theon Cross,
The Ezra Collective or
Yussef Kamaal. Instead
the listener is met with a
bubbly and precious synth
groove, interjected with
coy breaks as the tune
builds momentum before
melting before the listen-
ers ears, giving way to a
second riff.
Here, delay drenched
trumpet pierces the synth
driven soundscape as ten-
sions build once again into
a galaxy of sound, constel-
lated with streaks of trum-
pet and drum fills, crafting
an atmosphere guaranteed
to consume your world. A
brief reprise of it’s opening
theme suddenly rounds
the track out, leaving the
listener thoroughly diso-
riented.
‘Bubble Leaves’ is well
worth a listen for any
jazz fans wondering
what the future of jazz
might sound like, with it’s
unique synths, colourful
trumpetery and ingenious
grooves, there is plenty
here to enjoy.

As I edited the above review of Heavy is the Head, coverage has been circulating of a feud between Stormzy and Wiley. Wiley, often labelled the ‘Godfather
of Grime’, rose to prominence in the early 00’s with his crew Roll Deep. Continuing to produce singles and chart strongly into the 10s as Grime became more
palatable to the mainstream, he has found himself in somewhat of a social media black hole, seemingly unable to hold himself back from insulting fellow
rappers on twitter, most notably calling Drake a “culture vulture”.
Some back and forth, circulating around Wiley’s brother, as well as Stormzy’s perceived “watering down” of grime, and collaboration with Ed Sheeran
(which Wiley has also done), has cumulated in a series of ‘diss tracks’. ‘Eediyat Skengman’ 1 and 2 from Wiley’s camp followed Stormzy’s single ‘Wiley Flow’.
Stormzy clapped back quickly with ‘disappointed’, in which he attempts to take the higher ground. While Stormzy’s instrumental and flow are slightly
stronger, there is yet to emerge a clear winner.
Entertaining as the feud is, one cannot help but feel that the truest line to have come from this conflict is Stormzy’s: “Heavy is the Head is out now, so go
buy it”. The pair have yet to justify their media attention (and the accompanying sales) with any interesting writing, instead resting largely on cheap swipes.
