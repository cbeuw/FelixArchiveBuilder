Hungry for More
The effects of coffee, alcohol, and sleep deprivation on the gut microbiome and our health are a mixed bag,
offering both benefits and drawbacks
“Coffee
contains
polyphenols
and
antioxidants
which can
boost our gut
microbiome”
I
t may no longer
surprise you to hear
that our bodies are
composed of more
microbial cells than
human ones. Our bodies
are nutrient-rich surfaces
which allow these organ-
isms to thrive, inside and
out, when conditions are
right. The microorgan-
isms that live within us
contribute to the ecolog-
ical community of our
microbiome. Our gut mi-
crobiome (GM) forms as
soon as we are colonised
at birth and continues to
alter throughout our lives.
A vast and varied
population of bacteria
and other microbes live
along the gut lining. The
interactions between
microorganisms, as well
as the interactions they
have with our human
cells, are highly complex.
Some microbes provide
beneficial metabolic
products or help with ab-
sorption of vitamins and
nutrients, such as certain
B vitamins or vitamin K.
These ‘good’ microbes
are known as commen-
sals, living in harmony
with us – literally eating
from the same table (the
meaning in Latin of their
name). However, along
with the good, come the
bad and the ugly. These
are known as pathogens
and cause disruption and
disease. Luckily, com-
mensals often keep the
more dangerous microbes
under control, preventing
infection.
The effects of these
tiny organisms are not
limited to the gut. As our
gut and brain develop
together from the vagus
nerve during gestation,
overlaps between mood
and diet are increasingly
shown in recent research.
For instance, total
GM diversity was shown
by researchers to have
a positive correlation
with increased sleep
efficiency and total sleep
time. Waking and eating
at regular times is very
important for maintaining
a healthy GM. Time and
time again, research into
sleep shows how we are
creatures of habit and that
a good sleep routine of
around 8 hours is required
for adults. This should be
time in bed to wind down
and wake up at least, even
if the total time is not
spent actually sleeping.
Whether we want to
admit it or not, many of
us struggle to start the day
without a cup of coffee.
Coffee’s popularity comes
not only from the ritual
of preparing it or its
pleasant aroma, but from
its physiological effects
of short-term wakefulness
that our brain begins
to rely on. In a healthy
wake/sleep cycle, a com-
pound in the body, called
adenosine, accumulates
in waking hours to trigger
tiredness at the end of the
day. Caffeine, the active
stimulant in coffee, allows
us to overcome tiredness
temporarily by blocking
adenosine from targeting
its receptor, acting antag-
onistically. As adenosine
receptors are present in
the gut as well as in the
brain, the effects of drink-
ing coffee are not limited
to temporary alertness.
Caffeine can also cause
stress through vasodi-
lation of blood vessels
and can lead to an upset
stomach. However, coffee
contains polyphenols
and antioxidants which
are naturally-occurring
compounds in plants that
can boost our GM. In
recent studies, a higher
consumption of caffeine
was correlated with a
richer GM and reduced
inflammation of the gut.
So – as with anything,
caffeine is best consumed
in moderation.

Alcohol is another
commonly consumed bev-
erage. Within the gut, the
alcohol we drink is largely
absorbed in the small
intestine and stomach.
Alcohol contains high
quantities of sugar which,
once inside the body, can
drive over-proliferation
of hungry bacteria in the
gut, causing unbalanced
microbial growth (known
as dysbiosis). Paneth
cells in the small intestine
detect bacteria levels and
can secrete antibacterial
compounds to prevent
dysbiosis - but when alco-
hol is present these cells
become suppressed, and
we lose the protection they
offer. This can be very
dangerous for our health;
with more bacteria pres-
ent, competition for space
and resources increases,
so the bacteria secrete
toxins in self-defence.
However, the toxins cause
harm to their immediate
environment, which is the
case within our gut. Our
immune system reacts to
clear the danger by in-
creasing an inflammatory
immune response to the
bacteria.
Alcohol also causes the
gut to become ‘leakier’,
weakening the cell-cell
barriers. This is dangerous
as it allows more alcohol
and toxins to be absorbed
into the bloodstream.
Many cancers and cases
of liver disease can be
worsened by alcohol-in-
duced inflammation in the
gut. Evidence has shown
that excessive alcohol
consumption is associated
with liver damage, a key
organ in filtering toxins
and expired immune cells.
Studies which monitor
diet may give clues on
how to alleviate the risks
of poor health associated
with dysbiosis and gut
inflammation. More
“The effects
of these tiny
organisms are
not limited to
the gut”
human trials are needed
to confirm the benefits
of using dietary supple-
ments, such as probiotics,
to reduce side effects from
the over-consumption
of alcohol and caffeine,
sleep deprivation, or
even taking a course of
antibiotics.
Each microbe within
ourGMhastheintentionto
survive and either help or
hinder our bodies as a side
effect. When dysbiosis
occurs, often the growth
of pathogenic strains is
favoured, disrupting GM
health. Recuperative sleep
is essential for the body to
work optimally. The var-
ying outcomes of dietary
components are largely
down to personal habits
and the best thing is to be
aware of your own limits,
especially in the case of
alcohol. Regulating our
diet is a manageable step
we can take to ensure
we feed our body, and
its guests, to maintain a
balanced, healthy GM. As
complex as the body is,
tiny microorganisms can
have a great effect, just as
small and simple changes
can make impressive dif-
ferences to our health.
