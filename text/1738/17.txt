Googling into Extinction
T
he terminology
associated with
the internet
always seems to
paint a picture of a benign
and magical service that
transports data across
the planet without any
physical trace. Accessing
data instantaneously from
every corner of the earth,
we rely on the ethereal
bank of information in
most aspects of our day to
day lives, but the ‘cloud’
as we know it can have a
much more damaging and
visible impact than we
have been led to believe.
Every action that uses
the internet, be it web
browsing, sending/receiv-
ing emails or using apps
that require WiFi invokes
the use of a server to
transmit data to the device
you’re using. These online
requests are sustained by
physical servers, large
electronic structures
which form a global
network held together
by miles and miles of
undersea cables, switches
and other gizmos. It’s not
surprising to hear that this
infrastructure requires an
immeasurable amount of
electricity, wherein lies
our problem: 80% of all
data centers are powered
by energy derived from
fossil fuel consuming
power stations. A study
from 2015 estimates that
CO2 emissions from
internet activity are com-
parable to that of the entire
global aviation industry,
and others suggest that
the communications
industry could constitute
20% of all global electric-
ity output by 2025, which
could severely hinder
attempts to meet global
climate goals, such as
those outlined in the Paris
Agreement.
The sites with some
of the biggest request
inﬂuxes are unfortunately
not doing enough. Despite
making data servers
more energy efﬁcient and

attempting to source more
of their electricity from
renewables, Google’s
claim of carbon neutrality
since 2007 simply doesn’t
cut it: the US internet titan
is responsible for 40%
of the internet’s carbon
footprint stemming from
the 3.5 billion searches it
processes a day. Facebook
also has a role to play, in
that its data centres and
business operations led
to an output of 718,000
metric tons of CO2 in
2016. The usage of the
internet isn’t going to
slow down anytime soon
either; more and more
daily activities are being
substituted by WiFi
powered data storage and
transfer, so clearly some-

campaigns”
thing has to give.
One powerful initiative
with the aim of reducing
this wave of ‘digital pollu-
tion’is Ecosia, a non-proﬁt
search engine which uses
revenue it generates from
advertisements to fund
ecological campaigns,
most notably reforesta-
tion. Its ethos is simple:
the company pledges to
plant a tree for every 45
searches, it publishes its
monthly ﬁnancial reports
which demonstrate how
80% of all revenue goes
towards its environmental
projects, it doesn’t sell
your data (tut tut Google)
and importantly, all
searches are powered by
100% renewable energy.
Imperial on Ecosia is a
campaignaimingtoimple-
ment Ecosia as the default
search engine instead
of Google at Imperial.
With more than 65,000
searches and already 445
trees planted by Imperial
supporters, Imperial has
the potential to make
transformative impacts on
ecosystems, biodiversity
and livelihoods across
the world by making
this simple change. Take
part in this campaign
by spreading the word
and making Ecosia your
default search engine
using the Imperial link on
