ThinkingofWorkingforDominicCummings?
Think Again.
The PM’s Special Adviser’s call for scientists, software developers, weirdos, and misfits seems
well suited to Imperial students. But Cummings’ venture may be doomed to fail.

I
t’snotyourtypicaljob
posting. 2,900 words
long, and prefaced
with quotes from var-
ious intellectuals, the blog
post recently authored by
Dominic Cummins calls
for applications from “un-
usual” mathematicians,
physicists, economists,
computer scientists and
data scientists, along with
“super-talented weirdos”
with “odd skills” (no
doubt the pool of potential
applicants at Imperial is
rather large). Cummins,
current Chief Special
Advisor to PM Johnson,
intends to deploy this elite
team of misfits to address
certain “profound prob-
lems at the core of how
the British state makes de-
cisions” through big data,
artificial intelligence, and
advanced mathematics.
I confess that my first
reaction to skimming the
post was a positive one.
The general thrust of
what Cummings is trying
to do here is absolutely
correct. He has previously
discussed his frustrations
with trying to get anything
done within ‘the blob’that
is the civil service, full of
“Oxbridge English gradu-
ates who chat about Lacan
at dinner parties.” At the
same time, British univer-
sities are producing many
talented problem solvers
from STEM backgrounds
who can rarely apply their
skills for the betterment of
society. Instead, they are
caught by corporations
who have them nudge
around numbers to make
the wealthy wealthier,
or apply bleeding-edge
data science techniques
to optimising the number
of chicken sandwiches
stocked on a trans-At-
lantic flight. While large
companies have realised
that acquiring this kind
of talent is essential to
remaining competitive,
Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment seems to be lagging
desperately far behind.
Given all this,
Cummings’ new initiative
seems like a step in the
right direction. But if
you consider the posting
in more detail, and read
published responses to the
posting from academics, it
is clear that this approach
is fatally flawed.
On the surface,
Cummings seems to
have insight on how sci-
entific and mathematical
ideas can be applied to
understanding society.
In his blog post, he lists
several technical papers
that an applicant would
be expected to understand
and discuss. But impres-
sive as this list may seem,
it has been pointed out
that many of these scien-
tific concepts have been
around for a long time,
and their links to social
phenomena, while well
explored, are ultimately
very tenuous. Indeed, as
commented by science
writer Philip Ball in a
piece for The Article: to
those familiar with these
concepts, Cummings’
text is reminiscent of a
“rookie postgrad spouting
a breathless stream of
buzzwords and random
citations, devoid of depth
or context, in the hope of
convincing his supervisor
that he knows his stuff.”
Without a broad vision
for how these disparate
concepts from statistical
mechanics and machine
learning will fit together
to produce new under-
standing, this initiative
would be starting on
shaky ground.
But, let’s give
Cummings the benefit
of the doubt and assume
that he knows his stuff. Is
he right to think that the
application of these ideas
to social problems will
yield the “low hanging
fruit — trillion-dollar bills
lying on the street” that he
describes? It’s taken as an
article of faith in certain
circles (most notably,
tech companies) than any
problem is soluble if you
have: a sufficiently com-
plicated algorithm, a suffi-
ciently voluminous hoard
of data, or a sprinkling
of the magical pixie dust
called ‘machine learning’
(whatever that means).
Johnson’s Conservative
Party, I struggle to believe
those goals will serve
to improve the lives of
ordinary people.
I’ve not addressed
certain other ‘deficiencies
of appeal’ the job itself
has: the posting advertises
that “you will not have
weekday date nights,
you will sacrifice many
weekends — frankly it
will hard having a boy/
girlfriend at all” and “I’ll
bin you within weeks if
you don’t fit.” Plus, you
would be working for a
man who, in the same
blog post, claims that
Westminster does not
need more “drivel” about
Brexit is Cummings’God child that brought him to prominence //Pixabay
But if you keep abreast
of tech news, you’ll know
that algorithms can be
racist, and data collection
can be downright Or-
wellian. These things are
powerful tools, but they
can backfire, and they can
be applied to nefarious
purposes just as easily as
admirable ones. What’s
really missing from
Cummings’ 2,900 words
is any sense of moral
direction. There’s no
indication at all of the sort
of policies these technol-
ogies would be deployed
in aid of. ‘Solving the
nation’s problems’ is
by no means an objec-
tive goal, and when an
organisation is free to
define its own metrics of
success, it should come
as no surprise when those
metrics happen to align
with the interests of its
masters. And under Boris
gender identity diversity.
But ultimately, anyone
still considering applying
for this job has to ask
themselves whether they
really believe that joining
Cummings’ basket of
oddballs will see their
labour contribute to the
betterment of society. And
if not, do they care?
“What’s really
missing from
Cummings’
2900 words is a
sense of moral
direction, with
no indication
of what
policies will be
supported”
