Here is What You Missed at Winter Wonderland This
I know you thought you were free of the instagram
posts about churros and ferris wheels from Winter
Wonderland, but I wanted to appeal to you all, hungry
student to hungry student, about what it has to offer
when it comes to the food. As Imperial students this is
the best way to try some of London’s biggest food stalls.

You know that the
term is back in full swing
after the winter break
when Winter Wonderland
starts packing up. This
attraction is an iconic part
of London’s Christmas
season and it’s obvious
why. And as much as
we love to complain as
Imperial students, we are
placed in an extremely
convenient position.
Located in Hyde Park,
it’s a short walk way from
the South Kensington
campus. The huge Ferris
wheel guides tourist to
their destination once they
leave the station like the
north star. From the right
building here, you can see
it from a window, calling
to you to give yourself
a well-deserved study
break.
I can’t keep going
without mentioning that it
is completely free to enter.
Even if you aren’t one for
thrill-seeking rides and
riggedgames,justwalking
around and looking at the
amazing lights and attrac-
tions can lift any Grinch’s
mood and get you into
the Christmas spirit. And
yet, I know people who
have never been. Every
year they let the fair pass
them by. So this is my
final attempt to let people
know about what they’ve
been missing the only way
I know how: food.
If you aren’t a parent
of 4, trying not to lose
track of your kids, the
most likely type of food
option you will go for are
the stalls. Yeah they have
proper restaurants that you
can book ahead and all but
I feel that there should be
some sort of spontaneity
when you come to a place
like this.
Winter Wonderland has
their own stalls spread all
over the site so you will be
able to bag yourself some-
thing the second you feel
peckish from any section.
Hyde Park in December
can get quite chilly so
they’ve got a bunch of
options to help you stay
warm and keep you going.
Just make sure you don’t
puke it all up on one of the
rides if you manage to be
able to afford that.
The options at their
stalls are pretty much
the same every year. The
churros are an iconic
staple. If you didn’t get
a picture with a bag of
churros, did you even go
to Winter Wonderland?
They came out as a fiver
for a bag of them with
just sugar as the topping.
They are really generous
with the toppings (though
with prices like that they
are definitely still making
a comfortable profit). You
leave with a measly 5
stick of varous sizes. It’s
no where close to a meal
but the sweet content will
make you feel queasy
after it all the same.
The donuts are a
personal guilty pleasure of
mine. They are the freshly
cooked ones that you find
at amusement parks so
they remind me of the
times when I would go
to Thorpe Park or Chess-
ington with my family - a
much simpler time. These
are good for if you want
to recreate the experience
or just didn’t get a chance
to take advantage of their
student deals over the
summer. They are very
You can’t go to Winter Wonderland without getting one of these // Zahra Abiola

reminiscent of the ones
you get in the United
States which also means
that they are very greasy
and filled with enough
sugar to give you a sickly
surprise at the bottom
of the bag. Although the
brandless stands all seem
to have different names to
lure you in, they are the
same products. They give
you the illusion of choice
by calling the same item
different names or having
new combinations to make
you think you gamed the
system to get the best
value for money on an
already overpriced treat.
Their stalls are something
to experience at least once
in your life but not crucial
to the experience. The
novelty of a half-metre
hotdog wears off quickly
for me.
My favourite part of
the park is the street food
section. Some of London’s
biggest food stalls set up
shop in the park to get in
on the tourist action the
fair has going on. These
are usually operating in
areas and times that are
just out of my reach with
the way that my timeta-
ble is set up. It’s hard to
