H
ello again to all
of you budding
future bankers.
By the end of
this article you’re going to
be experts on quants. Sort
of. More like moderately
informed.
What are quants?
They’re people who can
Computer Geeks who earn more than you: Quants
understand and build
complicated mathemat-
ical models that will in
some way be used to
make more money and
perhaps mitigate risk.
Those who work directly
with the traders are front
office quants and those
who sit in the dusty room
in the basement are back
office quants. There are,
of course, different sub-
categories such algorith-
mic trading quants, risk
management quants and
others, but by and large
these guys are fundamen-
tally quite similar.
As you can imagine,
the pay for these positions
tend to be quite high.
Those working in front
office positions are better
compensated than their
peers in back office, but
have more stressful and
demanding roles.
For example, someone
working as a back office
quant will probably have
the title quantitative re-
searcher. Their job could
be to validate statistical
models and analytics
programs or to research
and analyse market trends
among other things. Being
in the back office may
sound quite dull to some
but it is essential to a bank.
The more exciting role is
working as a front office
quant, typically termed
quantitative trader. Here
you’ll be working directly
with colleagues on the
trading floor coming up
with some fancy pants
algorithm that’s going to
make the trader a lot of
money. As you move up
the ranks, you’ll usually
specialise in a particular
area – derivatives pricing,
quantitative investment
strategies, algo trading
etc.
Becoming a Quant
To be a quant you need
to have Big Brain, but that
doesn’t mean everyone
who can do it should do it.
The sort of problems you
face and the work you do
is quite narrowly focused.
You’re not going to meet
with management or talk
to shareholders and there

isn’t much opportunity to
move to positions where
you manage people. This
is however compensat-
ed for with very large
salaries. If you’re serious
about becoming a quant,
be sure that you actually
like the work that it entails
and aren’t doing it for the
money. That being said,
how do you become a
quant?
Typically, they have
an extensive background
in statistics, computer
science, or something
closely related. PhD’s
among quants are not
uncommon. If you’re
looking to get ahead of the
competition, you might
want to consider further
studies. Some quants
tend to focus more on the
mathematical side of their
work whilst others lean
towards the data model-
ling and programming
side.
Banks prefer that all
future quants have some
background or at least
familiarity with program-
ming, according to the
Goldman Sachs strat who
rejected me. Not bitter
about it. I swear. A ‘strat’
is a mixture of someone
who works in structuring,
quantitative finance and
engineering in a bank.
Perhaps there’ll be an

article on this at some
point in the future.
The future of Quants
There seems to be a
lot of discussion about the
future of quants. They’re
hot right now but that
could easily change in the
future. Go back 3 decades
when Microsoft Excel was
introduced into banks. The
traders no longer needed
to send a ton of numbers
to the guy in the back
room to crunch because
they could do it them-
selves. This resulted in a
decrease of the number
of back and middle office
employees as they were
now obsolete. Apply the
same sort of scenario to
the modern day. Take a
cash equities project for
example, traders used to
have to ask quants to do
basic post trade analysis
for them. With the aid of
Python, traders can do this
themselves in turn making
some quants obsolete.
This is exactly what’s
happening at Barclays. Of
course, most quants have
significant amounts of
other, more complex work
to do and these guys will
probably be around for a
while. It’s the ones who
only push out 20 lines of
code in a day that Barclays
are looking to axe.
The best quant jobs are
probably not in banks but
on the buy-side. So if this
article has inspired you to
become a quant well then
you should look to work
in a quantitative fund like
Two Sigma or Citadel.
Here, there’s much
more of an opportunity
for you develop as a quant
and they pay astronomical
amounts. These roles
however, are ridiculously
competitive but we go to
Imperial so we must be
able to get any job we
want right? Right..?
