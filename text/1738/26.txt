lagued by years
of complaints
of low quality
teaching the
College has announced
that they are resorting
to desperate measures.
In order to boost morale
and enthusiasm, the 10
lowest performing lec-
turers, as reported by the
SOLE survey, will be
pitted against each other
in a no-holds barred
cage fight with only the
top 3 survivors retaining
their jobs.

Vice-Provost (Blood
sports) has declared that
he is saddened that the has
had to do this. It is not all
