Insane Cryptogram:
I don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you want. If you’re looking for ran-
som, I can tell you I don’t have money... but what I do have are a very particular
set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a
nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end
of it - I will not look for you, I will not pursue you... but if you don’t, I will look for
you, I will find you... and I will kill you.
