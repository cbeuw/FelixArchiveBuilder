H
ey everyone
and welcome
to a new term/
year/decade at
Imperial! Apologies for
the near total silence from
me in these columns in the
last few issues – last term
was incredibly busy for
me, as I’m sure it was for
many of you, with project
deadlines, lectures to
revise and some important
Union business, such as
the debate on rent prices
in halls. I promise I’m
going to try to make use
of this column more reg-
ularly this term (with the
key word being ‘try’)!
We in the RSMU have
a very busy term ahead
of us, with some fantastic
events, campaigns and
traditions. Here’s a brief
summary of what you can
expect, although of course
you should always keep
an eye on your emails and
our Facebook page for
more information!
Hill Cup Week (16th –
23rd January)
A trio of events to
celebrate and accentuate
the ﬁerce rivalry between
our three Departmental
Societies. Beginning
with Curling (16th Jan),
followed by the Bake
Off (20th Jan) and cul-
minating in a Pub Quiz
(23rd Jan), it’s sure to be
a fantastic week of events.
Tickets for curling are on
sale now!
Bottle Match (21st –
23rd February)
The undisputed
highlight of the RSMU
calendar, this weekend of
sport and festivities will
be held in Cornwall this
year. 150 Royal Miners
will be heading down
to Penryn to play in and
support a range of sports
teams
Leadership Elections
and RSMU Awards
While the timetables
for these is yet to be an-
nounced, this term we’ll
be electing next year’s
RSMU Committee; the
Elections may seem like
a long way off, but they’ll
come around sooner
than you expect, so start
thinking about running for
a position if you haven’t
already! We’ll also be
awarding RSMU Colours
and Awards later in the
term. Both the results of
the Leadership Elections
and the recipients of the
RSMU Awards will be
announced at…
RSMU Spring Dinner
(Mid-March, date
TBC)
The ﬁnal formal
dinner of the academic
year, Spring Dinner is a
fantastic way to ﬁnish off
the term and to celebrate
your achievements and
the achievements of your
colleagues. With guest
speakers, election results
and a lovely three-course
meal, this is not an event
you’ll want to miss!
Of course, we have
much more planned for
you in the coming term,
including a fantastic
campaign to celebrate the
diversity of the RSMU,
as well as many smaller
events, which we’ll publi-
cise closer to the time.
That’s all from me this
week; so Happy New
Year, good luck with any
remaining exams and
enjoy your Spring Term!
