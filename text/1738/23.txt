persuade your friends to
follow you to Southbank
for lunch and get back
to lectures in time, but
it’s lot easier when it’s a
20-minute walk away. All
the street food stands are
together in one part of the
park, so if you managed
to stay strong and resist
the lull of the half-meter
hotdogs then you’ve got
a much better range to
choose from. This time
they had options from fish
and chips to Indonesian
food, so it’s perfect for
every taste.
The Mac Factory was
incredible. They do New
York style mac n’ cheese
and they do it well.You get
your classic creation with
some creative toppings
that send the whole thing
to another level. Just
the base is great. It’s so
creamy and warm with
the macaroni cooked to
perfection. I really appre-
ciated this because there is
nothing I hate more than
mushy pasta. It was well
seasoned, bursting with
enough flavour to keep
every bite interesting. The
cheese pull was out of this
world.
I got the Super Mario
for £8, which consisted
of the usual topping of
breadcrumbs as well as
truffle oil, sautéed mush-
rooms, and garlic. Truffle
has been a trend on the
food scene for a while
now. Some people find it
gimmicky, while others
cannot get enough of it.
“Truffle has
been taking
over the
internet and
is quickly
becoming
my favourite
trend”

Before that day, I hadn’t
really thought much of
it, but after this, truffle
is quickly becoming my
favourite trend, because it
did so much for the meal.
The people running the
stand were great and I was
able to get myself an extra
helping of breadcrumbs.
To me, the breadcrumbs
are the best part, because
they add so much to the
texture of the dish. You
also get a good-sized pot
as your order to fill you up
as you continue to wander
around the park.
They don’t incorporate
the toppings with the dish,
and with how deep the
pot is, more than the layer
I got would have been
beneficial. Be careful of
how you eat it or you’ll
end up with plain mac n’
cheese to end your meal.
Like I said earlier, not the
worst thing in the world,
but I personally love
finishing off with a bang.
If you want to really see
what you missed out on,
you can head to Camden
or Euston to give it a try.
The other highlight
of the trip was Truffle
Burger. And yes, more
truffle. It slaps, okay. This

Year and No It Was Not Just the Churros
burger joint has a cult
following on the internet
so when I saw it was
finally 20 minutes from
me, I knew I had to try
it. We didn’t think we
could handle one of the 5
patty once we see on their
feed but we still went for
their most popular option.
We are very happy to say
“This burger
joint has a cult
following. We
are happy to
say that it lives
up to the hype
and more”
that it lives up to the hype
and more. The burger was
so good we had to get
another. The meat had a
good texture – cooked
to perfection. The truffle
mayonnaise and onions
gave the whole thing a
unique taste. Sad to say
that if we want anymore
of it now, we will have to
miss a lecture or two by
going to Covent Garden’s
Seven Dials Market.
Don’t take my word for
it when it comes to these
reviews: go try them for
yourself. There is a reason
these places got a spot in
one of the London biggest
Christmas markets so next
time the tourist trap comes
to Hyde Park, expand
your tastes and have a
look, or just stick with
the mandatory picture of
churros to let your whole
feed know how close you
are to one of London’s
famous attractions.
If you eat at
any of the
places we
recommend,
try any of
the recipes
in Food, or
think there is
somewhere
we really have
to check out,
tell us! We
would love to
hear what you
think. It can
be articles or
just general
comments or
feedback.
