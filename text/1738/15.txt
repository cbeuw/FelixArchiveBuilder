rowsing the
Steam store
one day, I came
across two
intriguing roguelikes. Just
as Dead Cells brought
something fresh and fun
to the genre in its fast-
paced Metroidvania style
gameplay and iterative
approach to difficulty,
Hades and Noita bring
some unique ideas to the
table and have certainly
piqued my interest.
Hades is the latest
from Supergiant Games,
the indie team behind
Bastion, Transistor and
Pyre. Hades follows suit
with Supergiant Games’
style of dropping a player
into their meticulously
crafted world and feeding
them options to play
the way they want. You
play as Zagreus, son of
Hades. Equipped with just
a sword at first, you’re
thrown into Tartarus, the
lowest floor of Hell, and
are left to take on your
mission - to escape the
Underworld. The music
starts as you descend,
and you’re left to absorb
the tense atmosphere sur-
rounding the lavish House
of Hades.
As you progress
through chambers by
slashing through shades
in gloriously fluid and fast
paced combat, you’ll find
myriad ways to buff-up
and determine your
playstyle for the current
run. The game is rich in
dialogue and charming
characters. It doesn’t just
hand you buffs silently,
your relatives, the Gods
of Olympus aid you with
a choice of unique boons
and converse at every
free moment. Even better,
the dialogue doesn’t get
stale as the Gods will
make comments specific
to who you’ve met and
what you’ve done so
far – a trait shared by
the entire cast. Sisyphus,
among other characters,
aids you mid-run, giving
a handsome amount of
health or gold, or levelling
up some of your boons,
among other gifts. Even
the bosses have several
unique lines, all voice
acted, with more lines
added every update. The
attention to detail in the
characters and their inter-
actions, such as Hypnos
(the embodiment of sleep)
that annoys everyone
around with his snarky
quips, is what makes
Hades so special and
memorable, .
While the limited
chamber layouts do get
repetitive at times, the
combat options help keep
the game fresh. Other
than boons and gifts, your
weapon itself can change.
This isn’t just changing
between the sword and
the unlockable spear,
shield, bow and railgun;
there’s further diversifi-
cation of playstyle given
by unlockable variants of
these weapons - though
there’s a significant grind
required to unlock some
variants. During runs, you
can power up your weapon
with unique upgrades
using one of Daedalus’
hammers; one run my
spear would be bouncing
between enemies with
each throw, and another it
would land with a blast for
AOE damage! Combined
with boons like poison
damage and critical hit
chances, my tactics each
run changed drastically.
Additionally, there’s
keepsakes with their own
effects that can be changed
between each level of Hell
and purchasable upgrades
for Zagreus himself at his
mirror before a run. All in
all, Hades is a masterful
mixture of addictive,
engaging gameplay and
captivating storytelling.
Leaving behind the
beautifully drawn art and
landscapes of Hades,
we move into the pixel
wizardry of Noita.
Plopped down into a
randomly generated
world, you’re simply
taught how to move, kick
and view your inventory
which includes a water
flash and two wands – one
fires small but unlimited
bolts, and the other fires
up to 3 bombs. Anyone
who has played the
physics simulation game
Powder knows how much
fun it is to mess around
in a pixel-based physics
engine. Noita makes the
most of this, starting by
placing torches all around
to be shot open, raining
fire down onto wooden
structures to burn for
the player’s pleasure.
Then you find your first
non-default wand, and
eventually make your way
to the bottom of the level,
to find a massive glowing
purple portal.
In-between levels,
you’re able to edit the
spells loaded into your
wands, buy new wands or
spells, and pick a perk. I
sometimes found myself
too short on gold to buy
much, and it took some
time mixing and matching
the spells I wanted in each
wand and trying them out.
Despite this slight tedium,
Noita breaks free from the
tradition of accumulating
powerups of predeter-
mined nature with this
mechanic. Every wand
has random stats such as
cast delay, spell slots and
maximum mana, and the
number of possible spells
is in the hundreds, making
thousands, if not millions,
of possible combinations.
Wands can produce
energy spheres with trails
of fire or shoot explosive
crystals that deal critical
damage to slime drenched
enemies or fire bouncy
orbs that ricochet all over.
This system has great po-
tential alone, but combin-
ing it with the physically
simulated world unlocks
a treasure trove of golden
moments.
The developers have
made the most of this
with an inbuilt replay
function that can record a
few seconds of gameplay
– useful for the many
amusing and frustrating
deaths you’ll experience.
Dying in Noita takes many
forms, and you’ll often get
“Noita’d”. What I mean
by this is a death that you
simply can’t predict. An
enemy could pick up a
wand with a nuke spell
and instantly obliterate
you in an all-encompass-
ing circle of fire. You
could be trying out a new
wand and foolishly turn
yourself into whiskey,
dying instantly, or acci-
dentally douse yourself
in a polymorphine potion
and become a useless
winged sheep during a
crucial fight. While fun,
the chaos does lead to
being very cautious and
making snap decisions to
the point of being almost
unfair.
Noita’s massive scale
extends past the 8 floors
downward to Hell,
however, and the com-
munity has come together
and discovered secrets
and areas intentionally
hidden. The lack of infor-
mation can be off putting
for new players for sure,
but seeking knowledge
for yourself is a key theme
of Noita. So, if you hear
rumours of a cursed egg,
an altar in the sky, hidden
treasure, an Eastern
desert, a Western lake,
mysterious orbs, parallel
universes or alchemical
potions… well, just be
prepared to dive in and do
some exploring.
Hopefully both games
clean up their minor
issues and improve their
strengths further – I’ll cer-
tainly be keeping a close
eye on their development
cycle in early access for
now.
