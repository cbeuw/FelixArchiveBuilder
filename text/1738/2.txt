Memes and Feelings
W
e’re back!
Hopefully,
e v e r y o n e
had an ex-
cellent Christmas break.
Now it’s back to the
grind, which is a relat-
able feeling for many at
the moment. I’m pretty
sure a significant chunk
of our student body
currently feel like they
are facing their own
apocalyptic meltdown –
much more dire than the
Australian bushfires and
the oncoming eruption
of WW3 – the colloquial
name for which is, I
believe, “exam season”.
There’s a famous
tale about the Russian
engineers who braved
the radiation in order to
mitigate the Chernobyl
disaster. Without them,
the meltdown would have
resulted in a fallout zone
both larger and more
irradiated. The details are
often exaggerated, but
nonetheless their heroism
should be remembered.
I’m positive, however,
that it pales in compari-
son to the courage with
which a hungover student
who skipped 18 of their
course’s 26 lectures
faces down the prospect
of spending three hours
locked into their personal
torture chamber – an
exam hall.
Rather than downing
vodka for so-called Dutch
courage, they grimace and
chug down plastic bottles
of water, trying to clear
their heads of the boozy
daze remaining from the
Christmas break – or
perhaps just wishing for
the sweet embrace of
death-by-burst-bladder.
But truly, their stoicism
is made clearest in the
aftermath. They grimace
at their mates and laugh
it off, or head home to cry
quietly to themselves.
There’s two sides to
the above satirical bit of
nonsense – the fact that
many students do not talk
about the problems they
are facing, and the fact
that simultaneously we all
overdramatise the trauma
of exams. Let me explain
that dichotomy, before I
get lynched for downplay-
ing people’s troubles.
Exams and coursework
are stressful. They’re
grueling, long, hard, and
often the work that goes
into them is unrecognised.
One of the core pieces
of advice I’d give any
student is to develop a way
to value and take pride in
your own work, because
you sure as hell aren’t
going to receive that val-
idation from elsewhere.
The sleep-deprived PhD
student marking your lab
report is not going to grace
you with the approval
your teachers or parents
might have in school.
As a result, we all
complain regularly and at
length about how awful
our exams or courses
are. That’s entirely fair.
But I think that too often,
this mutual grouching
does not actually ade-
quately express our own
individual problems and
complaints, which, being
science nerds more at
home with equations or
code than actual hUmAn
EmOtIoNs, we’re all
often rather terrible at
dealing with.
There isn’t much
of a culture of sharing
feelings at Imperial. You
can debate where that
stems from all you like,
but that’s the result – and
it’s well-documented.
Students often suffer in
silence, until they’re in
a state and it’s too late
to provide meaningful
support. Personally, I
distinctly recall my doctor
telling me she didn’t need
me to write down the
Senior Tutor’s email – she
already had it memorised
from seeing so many stu-
dents from my course in
the preceding week before
exams.
Not all of those students
would have been on the
“wellbeing radar” before
it gets to exams and they
crumble – because they
do not talk about their
problems.
The memes and jokes
we use to complain about
our suffering can be great
tools for sharing and alle-
viating some of the stress.
They give us a shared
language and shared ca-
tharsis. But they can also
mould the doctrine of our
thinking and expression.
We default to saying them
in the place of active and
considered expressions
of our own personal
suffering. Every person’s
struggles are unique to
them, and come from their
own individual factors,
personality, history, and
so on.
A joke which is gener-
alised so as to be broadly
applicable to everyone
cannot, ever, accurately
communicate how you
truly feel. Using it is like a
salve to soothe pain – it’s
a symptomatic treatment
that doesn’t actually
address or solve the core
underlying problem.
Indeed, it means your own
feelings are left unarticu-
lated, even to yourself,
just as alleviating pain
can cause one to ignore a
wound. They’re an easy
path to share in the mutual
relief every student feels
by griping to one another
– which is healthily ther-
apeutic – but can also ob-
struct the understanding
you have of yourself and
that others have of you.
It’s a weird sort of
Orwellian Newspeak. By
communicating only in a
smaller set of generalised,
pre-fabricated phrases,
jokes, memes, thoughts,
whatever, we can end up
struggling to adequately
recognise individual
pain, to provide individ-
ual support for individual
problems.
In the worst case
scenario, this can be
catastrophic, leading to
feelings of isolation and
loneliness – something
is wrong, but we lack the
ability to articulate it,
and lack the desire to do
so when we can instead
temporarily soothe that
pain by bitching together
on IC Exposed.
This is not to be taken
out of proportion. Memes
are not going to destroy
society as we know
it – at least, not in this
way, though a trip to r/
cursedcomments or /b/
does demonstrate the utter
degeneracy of the human
race.
There is, however, a
danger to be recognised.
Talk about your problems,
and where they come
from, that are specific to
you and your feelings. Ar-
ticulate them, and speak
to friends, family, and
support networks. Don’t
just laugh it off with an
image macro and believe
you are better after.
