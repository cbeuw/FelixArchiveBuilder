Shifting attitudes towards MDMA
Lauren Ratcliffe reports on the medical side of the popular clubbing drug
"Utilising

MDMA, or for you chemists
out there 3,4-methylen-
edioxymethamphetamine,
more recognisably referred to as
ecstasy is a prevalent and well-known
drug. It’s no state secret that a major-
ity of the people who are reading
this have encountered it – whether
that be through occasional to regular
recreational use or simply knowing
someone who has taken it.
In the 2013 Felix drug survey,
MDMA was revealed as the second
most regularly used illegal drug
amongst students at Imperial College,
closely following cannabis. Further-
more, according to a recent drug
survey by The Guardian, 31% of the
UK population aged 16-24 have taken
illegal drugs and 25%of this subsam-
ple admitted to having taken MDMA
at least once in their lives. It is safe
to say that it is a promiscuous drug,
whose usage has been shown to span
across all ages and social classes.
Regarded among scientists as an
‘empathogen’ encouraging social
interaction and openness, but better
known by clubbers for its ability to
make you feel like you’ve just eaten
a golden mushroom in Super Mario,
MDMA makes your heart race, booty
shake and sweat pour as it fuels an all-
night dance workout of the like you
would never see at Ethos.
Researchers at Imperial are taking
a different perspective on MDMA
and shifting attitudes away from its
widely renown clubbing reputation
and moving them towards its medical
potential. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris
(you may have read our article a few
weeks ago about his research with
LSD), alongside other researchers at
Imperial College and University Col-
lege London including the infamous
Professor David Nutt, are utilising
MDMA’s empathy-inducing and
positive emotion-enhancing qualities.
There is potential for use amongst pa-
tients in therapy, to help sufferers of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
This team of scientists screened 19
volunteers on fMRI scanners after
taking small doses of the drug (100mg
MDMA-HCl) to detect changes in cer-
ebral blood flow (which has been caus-
ally linked to neurological activity).
They also conducted tests involving
memory cues describing participants’
best and worst autobiographic memo-
ries to see their reaction on MDMA
compared with controls.
Volunteers rated their favourite
memories as significantly more
vivid, emotionally intense and posi-
tive after MDMA than placebo and
experienced worst autobiographical
memories as significantly less nega-
tive, alongside a reported reduced
fear-response. One participant of
the study described their experience:
“When I reached back for the bad
memories [under MDMA] they did
not seem as bad; in fact, I saw them as
fatalistic necessities for the occur-
rence of later good events.”
With a marked positive shift in
emotional perception of both good
and bad autobiographical memories
the results of this particular study
indicate that MDMA holds potential
for use in conjunction with psycho-
therapy. After looking over scans of
the volunteers’ brains, they also saw
that in participants that had taken
MDMA there was increased blood
flow to an area of the brain known to
be involved in processing complex
visual stimuli, such as faces. They
therefore hypothesised that this in-
creased activity related to the reports
of heightened vividness of memory
recollection while on the drug.
Exposure therapy is the current
treatment for PTSD and is very
effective. It requires patients to
remember traumatic memories in
order to re-engage and overcome
them (similar to treatments for pho-
bias). One theory for using MDMA
alongside exposure therapy is that it
could allow the patient to more easily
engage with traumatic memories,
making psychotherapy more effective
and also shortening the length of the
costly treatment procedure.
As with almost everything in
science, the results from this study
should be taken with a pinch of
salt and with the limitations of the
methodology in mind. Despite an
improved sample size compared with
previous research, it is still small and
there is always room for expansion
with these studies, which is partly
the reason why they are carried out
in the first place. Dr Carhart-Harris
also stressed the need for more
research into further understanding
exactly how MDMA has such potent
and influential effects on emotional
processing.
Last week I conducted an interview
with Dr Carhart-Harris about his
career and ongoing research into LSD.
He is a charming man and interesting
speaker – keep your eyes peeled for
his feature article in a future edition
of Felix.
