What’s on this week:
Defamation training
12:00 - 13:30, November 4th,
Meeting Room 1
If you fancy meeting our
news team and getting
involved, come along and
learn about libel, defamation
and just how freely we use
the word “allegedly.”
Attendance is free, and food
will be provided.
To the right of this editorial is
the initial front cover we had
for this issue. We carved that
pumpkin during the late hours of
Tuesday night, and we then took it to
ACC Sports Night to photograph it on
Wednesday. After chasing down some
drunk fresher who tried to steal it
from us when our backs were turned,
we managed to get a great shot that
would have made an eye-catching, if
news-less front page cover.
Unfortunately, The Evening
Standard went to print before we
did, and published the story about
misbehaving rugby players, that we
cover more extensively on page 4.
Felix was already investigating the
story concerning some of the Medic
Rugby players streaking on camera
when this story hit the headlines, so
we have merged them together to
show that in reality, what may have
been an isolated incident may, in
fact, link into a larger subculture of
drinking through sports clubs.
It is debatable whether or not such
a subculture is damaging to those it
involves (or excludes as it may be),
and those it inadvertently involves
too. People were annoyed when their
tube was delayed by eights minutes,
and they probably didn’t enjoy seeing
a student strip to his boxers on a tube
platform.
But the damage such behaviour
from such a small subset of students
does to the reputation of students on
a whole is far worse.
Sports clubs will always drink
during their socials; they always have
done. Students will drink themselves
silly too, regardless of being in a team
or not; we only have to look back to
three issues ago when we covered
the drama surrounding the drunken
medic student on the boat, another
story picked up by The Evening
Standard.
Unfortunately, outside of the
Imperial bubble, and outside
of socials, drunken students
misbehaving carry with them the
connotations of all students being
a public menace, a waste of tuition
fees, louts and idiots. It is the people
outside of this bubble that know that
these connotations translate into
clicks on an article, hits on a website,
and, eventually, money in their
pockets.
However, after speaking to the boys
on the team today once the story
broke, many do not seem to be any of
these things at all, and were keen to
point out that it was the case of a few
people misbehaving and tarnishing
the reputation of the rest of the team.
Consider this an example of how
the press regards students, and
perhaps be wary in the future about
how you conduct yourself once you
leave the Union walls. The isolated
actions of a few have stopped the fun
of their team members, and can harm
the reputation of students as a whole
in the long run, something we are all,
no doubt, keen to avoid.
SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for some mistakes in
Issue 1585. These were:
- Mis-spelling Conall O’Neill’s name
at the top of his article in Music
In issue 1584, in our article on
the amenitites fund, we printed
the wrong igures for Gabor and
Linstead in our graph, confusing
them with igures for the entirity
of Eastside and Southside.
Thanks to Vasa Curin for correcting
us. With the adjusted igures, the
true amount of cuts to the funds is
closer to £150,000.
