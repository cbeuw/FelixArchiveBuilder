I’m Depressed. Let’s Sing About It.
Why am I depressed?
What is the cause of my
depression?” aren’t exactly
questions easily remedied by ringing
up NHS Direct and asking. This
opera, though, strives to find answers.
This contemporary opera takes
inspiration from Robert Burton’s
1621 textbook The Anatomy of
Melancholy, which was the first
serious discussion of depression and
renaissance medicine for melancholy.
The sole feat of transforming
this archaic text into a modern
performance deserves credit, and
inspires hope that opera is not a dying
breed, but one that may find its own
renaissance through taking on a
contemporary form.
Entering through heavy wooden
doors, the audience is led down a
dimly lit warehouse-like hall into
a cavernous space more fit for an
underground nightclub than a
conventional opera stage. Cracked
tiles on the wall and cement pillars
enhance the unorthodox setting,
whose raw, urban-decay ‘vibes’
naturally compliment and resonate
with the tone of the opera, rather
than appearing forced and out of
context.
The opera – performed by a total
of seven – weaves a fragmented
exploration of the central figure’s
– the Son’s – melancholy. The
Son’s depression is analyzed by
the Grandmother, the Father, and
a peculiar addition of the four
humours, each personified. Certain
other stylistically distinct additions
such as multiple large screens and
an assembly of a hundred terra
cotta warriors visually enhance the
experience, but a lack of plot and
character development is ultimately
a drawback.
What makes this opera
worth seeing are the vocals and
accompanying score, both of which
contrast alluringly against the
dimly lit underground setting. Six
performers provide a solid mix of
tenor, countertenor, soprano, mezzo
soprano, and bass. The rich vocals are
bel canto in the most traditional sense
and – if not necessarily flawless – lack
any painfully apparent weakness. The
eclectic range of instruments adds
texture to Benjamin Tassie’s score,
resulting in a surprisingly pure sound
from the haunting accompanying
orchestra. Moreover, an expressive
Gran with a megaphone proclaiming
deep space metaphors will surely
provide enough comic relief to get
one through the opera’s frequent
obscure musings.
In terms of thematic
accomplishment, however, the
opera is not nearly as impressive.
Like many contemporary art forms
which aim to tackle a complex
and somewhat abstract topic, The
Anatomy of Melancholy orbits the
central idea like an electron around
a nucleus, but never manages to
strike its core. Somewhat loosely
woven phrases and aforementioned
pseudo-poetic musings seem try-
hard without accomplishing any

purpose – aside from being crowd-
pleasing due to their superficially
confusing nature. Though at times
aspects such as philosophical Goethe
texts and enlightening metaphors
provide the ability to penetrate the
dynamic theme of depression, the
opera remains, ultimately, grazing
its surface. The ending is abrupt. The
baffled audience leaves with no more
understanding of depression than it
had upon entering the theatre.
Perhaps, though,in not providing
the audience with any concrete
conclusions regarding the causes or
cures for depression, the opera does
indirectly and subtly accomplish its
task. In not defining the nature of
depression it does define the nature
of depression for just what it is –
undefined, abstract, confusing, and
uncertain.
Anatomy of Melancholy ran from 22-
25th
October at Testbed 1, Battersea.
