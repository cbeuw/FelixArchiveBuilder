Ask Annie, your approachable Agony Aunt
Help! During last year I took on
quite a few club responsibilities.
The problem is, now that I’m in
second year I’m a lot more busy
that I thought I would be, and I
don’t feel like I have time to do
everything that I’m supposed to
do and keep up with my degree at
the same time. I’m worried about
letting everyone down. What
should I do?
Overwhelmed in Oxford Street
First, let’s have a look at what
happens if you don’t stop. The
pressure from all sides will keep piling
up, and something is going to have
to give. You might manage to keep
on going, not doing a satisfactory job
for anything, and just about scrape
through your exams. You might
concentrate too much on clubs and
fail your exams. Or you might crack,
decide to curl up in a ball for a week
or two and ignore everything. None of
these options are great, so you need to
change something.
Though you may not like the
idea, the best thing for you, and
probably everyone in general would
be to give up one, or some, of your
commitments. Try and figure out
which one would be the best equipped
without you. Did someone run
against you in the election who could
take over and give you a break? And
don’t worry about delegating some
of your tasks. Everyone finds it a bit
overwhelming at times, and there
will be people around who can take
some of the work, you just need to
remember to ask.
Just make sure to keep going to your
lectures, and don’t forget to revise.
Clubs can be some of the best parts
of uni life, but you’re here for the
degree and sometimes you need to
remember that.
Help! My girlfriend has just told
me that she is going to apply for
a PhD in America. We’ve been
together for over a year, and
everything has been going great,
but I’m really worried about what
going long distance is going to do
for our relationship. I don’t want
to stop her from doing what she
wants to do, but surely a bit of
consultation wouldn’t have gone
amiss?
Worried in Westminster
The very short answer to this is
simple: talk.
It’s not hard to talk to someone,
especially when you spend a
lot of time with them. Good
communication is one of the most
important things for a healthy
relationship, and it seems like maybe
neither of you have been doing this as
much as you might need to.
Going abroad for a few years is a big
step to take, and can have a massive
impact on a relationship. Should
she have told you about this before
now? Probably. But there might be a
reason that she hasn’t. Perhaps she
was worried about your reaction? If
so, strangely enough, the solution is
probably to talk to her. Let her know
if you’re okay with her going; letting
her know that she has your support
will make things much easier. Let her
know what you worried about, and
Agony Aunt Annie Whiteley is the woman who fought for women’s cloakroom facilities at Imperial,
and thus is qualiied to solve all your problems.
Hello all, Aunt Annie is back to help. You’ve been sending in your worries and I’ve done my best to try and help. We’ve also
brought back lonely hearts this week to see if we can help some of you lonely Imperialites ind love.
make sure that you discuss where you
stand.
Long distance is a big commitment
that can be pretty difficult to deal
with, and you need to make sure that
it’s what you both want to do. Just
don’t worry, talk about it, and things
might work out much better than you
think.
Help! I’ve been hanging out with
this guy on the floor below me in
halls. We’ve been texting all the
time, and I want to take things
further, but he just doesn’t seem
to get the hint. How do get him to
make a move?
Waiting in Wilkinson
This is not the first time that I’ve
dealt with this problem, and I
really doubt that it will be the last.
Hopefully you, and everyone reading
this, will get the message. It’s quite
simple. Just because you are a girl,
doesn’t mean that you can’t make
the first move. I continue to find it
amazing that so many people just
don’t seem to realise this. You think
you’re scared? You know what, so is
he.
It might be traditional for the male
to make the first move, but this is
just stupid. Everyone can go up to
someone and say ‘Hey, I like you, let’s
go for a drink’. If you are too much
of a wimp to do it in person, send the
same thing in a text. It won’t look
quite as good as doing it in person,
but at least you’ve done something,
which is better than sitting and
around and waiting.
Or maybe there is a reason that
Lonely Hearts
he hasn’t made a move yet, and he
just isn’t interested in being more
that friends. In that case, you get
rejected, get a bit upset, and move
on. And hopefully you’ll have learnt
something. Don’t let men be the only
ones to be rejected, that just isn’t fair.
Help! My roommate is gay, and
while I’m happy to be friends with
someone gay, I feel uncomfortable
with sharing a room with him. I
feel really vulnerable when I’m
getting changed in the same room
as him, like he’s eyeing me up as a
piece of meat. I know I’m probably
being paranoid, but it really
bothers me. What should I do?
Paranoid in Park Royal
The truth is, you probably are just
being paranoid. You don’t fancy every
girl you see, and he feels the same way
about most guys.
However you do have a point. There
is a reason that we don’t have co-ed
rooms, and it’s not because boys are
icky. Many females wouldn’t feel
comfortable getting changed in front
of a male, roommate or not, and it’s
sort of the same situation for you.
What you probably shouldn’t do it
bring it up. He’ll feel like you are
accusing him of being a bit of a perve,
and that ain’t great for roommate
bliss. If it’s really bothering you, try
and get changed in the room when
he’s not there. Or you could get
changed in the shower rather than
coming back to your room in a towel.
Of course, if he actually eyeing you
up, you might want to have a chat
with someone in your halls, because
that isn’t really okay.
Help! We got assigned our lab
partners for this year last week,
and though we get on pretty well,
he just isn’t pulling his weight.
He’ll ask me to meet up with him
to discuss lab reports but I feel like
I’m the only one contributing to
the conversation, and he just uses
my hard work to make his own life
easier. I don’t think it’s fair, but
I don’t want to bring it up in case
it makes things awkward, as we do
have to work together for the rest
of the year. What should I do?
Annoyed in Acton
There isn’t much point in not
bringing it up. If you don’t, there is a
good chance that you might just start
resenting him for not doing enough
work. Resentment will lead to snarky
comments and before you know it
you won’t be able to do anything
without making a comment about it.
It’s better to get it all out in the open
now before the resentment has time
to build.
If you don’t want to mention it
to him, try a different approach.
Why not control the direction of
the conversation, ask him questions
about the work you’ve been doing
rather than offering him answers
on a plate? If he can’t answer, he’ll
probably feel awkward, and hopefully
do more next week. Or discuss
what you’re both going to research
beforehand. That way you can both
contribute, and if he hasn’t done the
work you have more reason to be
upset.
