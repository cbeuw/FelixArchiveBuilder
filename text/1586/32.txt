After all my preaching about
de-stigmatising mental
illness, I think it’s about time
I talked about my own experiences
in the hopes that it will help at least
one person who is currently suffering
and feels like they’re alone. I have
struggled with anxiety for as long as I
can remember. It is no secret that I’m
known as the stressy, anxious, over
planner of my circle of friends, and
I’ve been known to literally worry
myself sick over small disagreements
and arguments (once in 7th
grade, I
spent an entire weekend in bed with
a fever because I had had a falling out
with my best friend). Now, I never
thought I had a problem,
I just thought I took things a little
too seriously, but that it was com-
pletely normal to burst into tears
every time someone shouted at you.
I felt like I was just weak, that it was
a personality flaw, and that I just
needed to ‘man up’ (don’t get me
started on that phrase, that’s reserved
for a whole different article) or grow
out of it, but it never even occurred to
me to ask for help or talk to someone,
because I was afraid I would just get
laughed at, or worse, chastised for
seeking attention or whining when
there was nothing really wrong. It
didn’t even matter that much, I was
living at home with my parents, I was
coasting through school and despite
a few hiccups, I was mostly getting by
alright.
It wasn’t until I came to university
that things started getting notice-
ably worse. I was suddenly thrown in
an environment where I was finally
being challenged academically, and
I’m not going to lie, I was struggling
for the first time in my academic
career. The perfectionist tendencies
that I’d, you know, perfected, over the
past twelve years of my academic life
meant that I would become paralyzed
every time I made a mistake or was
given feedback that showed I was
anything less than perfect (which was,
unsurprisingly, very often).
I had my first panic attack during
my 2nd
year programming exam. One
moment I was trying to code a struct
and the next I was gripped with fear,
with my heart attempting to make
a hurried escape from my chest.
Now, for those of you who’ve never
experienced panic attacks (and I hope
that’s most of you), it legitimately
feels like you’re about to die.
Breathing became difficult, I couldn’t
hear anything over the buzzing in
my head, there was a metallic taste in
my mouth, and most strangely, I felt
like I was watching all this happen to
me. Nothing felt real. I would later
find out that this depersonalisation
is a normal symptom of a panic
attack but at the time, it was the most
terrified I had ever been. I sat there
gripping the mouse for a good twenty
minutes, trying my hardest to just
breathe, before the fear started to
subside. By the time I could finally
think clearly again, there was only
half an hour left to the end of the
exam, and I rushed to finish all that
I could, trying to hold back my tears
enough to see what I was doing. The
moment we were allowed to leave, I
bolted for the bathroom, had a good
cry, and then went on with the rest of
my day, still frazzled but not saying a
word to anyone.
My biggest mistake that day was
not going straight to my academic
tutor and telling him what had
happened, but I just didn’t think that
I could. What would I say? That I had
suddenly gone into some trance and
couldn’t do my exam? I had no idea
what a panic attack was, I had never
heard of anyone having one, or what
it was like, so I had nothing to go on.
I didn’t think anyone would believe
me, or worse, that they’d tell me to
grow up and stop making excuses.
Things only got worse after that
first incident. Every time I was in a
similar, stress-filled situation, I would
feel the familiar fear tighten its grip
on me, and I would be back to the
whimpering mess I was in that stuffy
computer lab. It wasn’t long before I
was dreading even going to small tests
because just the thought of having a
panic attack would send me reeling
off the edge.
I had trouble sleeping, I was lucky if
I could get three hours of rest a night,
I would snap at everyone around me,
lie to my friends and family about
what was wrong, and constantly
talk down to myself because I
thought I was just being a wimp and
overreacting to things.
It took almost a year before my
boyfriend finally convinced me to
see a college counsellor, and when
that didn’t work, to contact my GP,
and that was only after I confided
in him about just how many times
I’d considered ending my life. After
that first GP appointment, and the
diagnosis of saying I had anxiety
disorder that everything started
making sense. I finally knew what
was wrong with me! There was a name
for what I was going through, and
it turned out to, unfortunately, be a
much more common condition than
I could have ever imagined. Although
there was still a long way to go to
recovery, just the fact that I knew
what was wrong came as a huge relief.
I was put on a waiting list for
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, was
prescribed antidepressants, finally
told my department about everything
that had been happening and started
getting the support I so desperately
needed. I won’t lie and say that
everything suddenly got better, and
that I stopped feeling terrible and
everything was instantaneously
dandy; almost a year later and I still
sometimes have to leave lectures
in a hurry because I’ve started
hyperventilating, but now I know that
it passes. I know that it gets better,
no matter how permanent it feels at
the time, and that’s enough to get me
through another day.
So if there is anything you take
away from this, it is that you’re not
alone, and as cliché as this sounds, it
does get better. Maybe not right away,
maybe not completely, and certainly
not linearly, but eventually, you’ll
learn to deal and you will start to feel
better.
So please, if you’re reading this
and think that you’re going through
something similar, don’t make the
same mistake I did and wait until
things get catastrophic before seeking
out help. Your well-being is the most
important thing, and no one who
matters is going to judge you for
asking for help. There are measures
put in place to try and make sure we
all get the support we need, so don’t
be afraid to use them, and remember,
you’re not alone!
