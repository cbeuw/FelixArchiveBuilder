Council descends into game of British Bulldog
Singaporean President visits Imperial
Thomas Lim and Kunal Wagle report on the second State Visit in a year
The second meeting of the Coun-
cil descended into confusion
when students were made to
literally take sides in an attempt to
work out where people stood on an
ambiguous motion.
The paper in question, presented
by Ben Fernando, RAG Chair,
was succinctly called “Motion to
Implement the Council Resolution
of December 10, 2013.” Its aim was
to introduce voting accountability
to Council. Ben proposed that
the Council should “publish
voting records in order to be truly
democratic,” which proved to be
a contentious issue with those in
attendance.
With the Council Chair unable to
reach a definitive conclusion of how
many people were for or against the
motion, it was suggested that students
stand to either side of the room to
physically show just exactly where
they “stood.”
The motion to introduce
publication of the voting records was
finally rejected, although a working
group has now been organised
to investigate the feasibility of
introducing electronic systems to
record voting anyway.
Said Ben Fernando, the man
behind the movement (literally and
figuratively), “It’s nice to see that the
issue of how the Council votes is being
publicised, even if you’re making fun
of us. Hopefully people read this and
wonder why they can’t go online and
find out how their representatives
have voted!”
One Union representative present
told Felix “It was a farce; I attend
council to sit and nod off, not to have
to physically move from one side of
the room to another.”
The council also decided to strip
the Executive Committee of its
powers. Although the functions of
the committee are yet to be formally
reviewed, since a lot of what is
decided by the committee is also
within the remit of the day-to-day
roles of Sabbaticals and paid union
staff members, it was decided to have
no members, have no function and no
longer meet.
The Executive Committee was
previously made up of the Sabbaticals,
Constituent Union representatives,
and four members of council. They
could previously oversee the financial
changes, but this was stripped from
their remit when Paul Beaumont,
then Union President, revised the
Constitution.
Philippa Skett describes the “action” as recorded votes motion is debated
What is council?
Considered the“hackiest”meeting
in the Union calendar,Union
Council meets roughly once a
month.Council is open to all
students to attend,but only those
elected with a seat in Council
can stand and be counted when
making decisions.
Students can take papers that
those in council then vote on,and
the changes are put into practice as
a result.
Any student can take a paper
to council,but most of those
submitted are by the Sabbaticals
or other members of Council.
The Sabbatical Oficers also
produce reports that people can
question,and have to vote to
accept.
Those who can vote include
Faculty representatives,
Constituent Union representatives,
and those elected in the council
elections that took place last week.
The Council is run entirely by
students,and no members of
staff from the Union are allowed
to attend except those that take
the minutes.The current Council
Chair,Paul Beaumont,was Union
President two years ago.
The Union Council describes itself
as“in effect the democratic voice
of the student body,”although
this should not be confused with
Felix,the“student voice of Imperial
College London.”
The Singaporean President
Tony Tan Keng Yam came
to visit Imperial College
London last Friday. Singapore forms
one the College’s largest groups of
international students. Recently
Imperial launched joint medical
school with Singapore and a new
Phenome research centre. This
week a new cybersecurity research
agreement has been signed.
President Tan visited the
Carbon Capture Pilot Plant, where
academics, students and industrial
partners test and develop new ways
of capturing and harnessing CO2
emissions before they can harm the
planet.
Speaking at a State Banquet
for President Tan, the Queen
said, “Today Imperial College is
helping to train a new generation
of Singaporean doctors, just one of
many important partnerships that
it and other UK universities are
building with Singapore.”
The practical aspects of the
Singaporean President’s visit
came apparent when the Sherfield
Walkway and Dalby Court were
sealed off. Confused students had
to wait patiently whilst a large
contingent of Metropolitan Police
Officers searched the courtyard for
any signs of explosives of weapons.
Sniffer dogs were also out in force,
with at least two seen checking the
campus. Frustrations grew as the
minutes ticked by with students
and staff alike forced to wait for the
President to arrive, shake hands with
students, and leave so Imperial could
continue with their routines.
A momentary lapse in security
caused a panic when the President
was meeting students on Dalby
Court. A student managed to walk
through the Bessemer entrance and
through to the ramp down to the
Queen’s Tower Lawn. At this point,
College Security chased after him
and secured him. Whilst they were
telling him off, the lack of security
at other door entrances meant other
members of the College patiently
waiting decided to try their luck
and walk through. Chaos ensued
as Security then tried to stop more
students from entering Dalby Court.
Imperial’s student body has 400
full-time Singaporean students in
addition to many more exchange
students.
Professor Alice Gast, President of
Imperial College London, serves on
the Academic Research Council of
Singapore.
Professor Gast said, “We are
honoured to welcome President
Tan to Imperial, as we celebrate the
College’s rich history of collaboration
with Singapore. President Tan’s
firm commitment to excellence in
research and higher education is
helping us to build on these strong
foundations as our relationship
develops.”
This is the second time that a Head
of State has visited the College in the
last twelve months. In November
2013 the President of South Korea,
Park Geun-hye, visited the College.
