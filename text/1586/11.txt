So if you’ve been reading the news
recently, you’ll surely be aware
of the impending apocalypse
sweeping Western Africa and soon
enough, we are assured, the rest of the
world.
I know, I can hardly wait myself.
I am, of course, referring to the
recent outbreak of Ebola, which
has recently claimed its first victim
in the United States: the first such
death outside of Africa. All over the
US, cries from the big names on the
American Right (Jindal, Paul, Christie
et al) have called for: the closure of
borders, the grounding of flights, and
the implementation of draconian
quarantine procedures. Their calls
stand in stark contrast to the opinions
of much of the scientific community,
who say that the greatest defence
against Ebola is a good offence; that
we must smother the outbreak before
it becomes too widespread to handle
effectively. This means allowing the
free movement of manpower and
material so as to equip aid workers
with the tools necessary to fight new
outbreaks, and suppress existing ones.
Their opinions have fallen on deaf
ears. A few days ago, Mr Christie took
matters into his own hands, forcing a
young healthcare worker into a badly
ventilated, poorly sanitised tent in
Newark; the first example of his oft
talked about ‘quarantine measure’.
With the likelihood of the GOP (or
the Republican party) making large
gains in the senate in November,
further such cases are almost an
inevitability.
Of course, Christie and his ilk
are easy targets. Theirs is a cry of ‘a
common-sense perspective’, where
nuance and subtlety give way to
simplicity and facility. Their cries are
part wilful ignorance, part midterm
electoral pandering. However, they
are wholly damaging and harmful.
They are not the only culprits.
The disproportionate levels of
alarm in the states - and in many
other countries around the world
– is propagated by a trifecta of
uninformed policy making, shoddy
reporting, and a muted scientific
community. The last point is perhaps
the most important of the three:
journalists will report poorly, and
policy makers will act ignorantly so
long as they are able to do so with
little opposition. The scientific
community must be that opposition.
Of course, the scientific community
chooses not to. After all, we have
better things to occupy ourselves
with, right?
The truth is that we must assert
ourselves. We should be looking
In Signatures of the Visible, Fredric
Jameson states that “the visual
is essentially pornographic”
– that is, its end is in “mindless
rapture”. That being said, as any
reader of Orwell knows, there
are degrees of equality; that is to
say, while all ‘visuals’ (forgive the
clumsy expression) are essentially
pornographic, some are more
essentially pornographic than
others. The trial of Oscar Pistorius,
so widely broadcast this summer,
was one of these paradoxical beasts
– the Napoleons and Squealers, the
generally ‘more equal’. The obscene
spectacle of a sordid celebrity tragedy
was seized upon by the major news
channels as not only a worthy news
piece but further as so important as
to merit global coverage. It seems
this turgid carnival with a faceless
protagonist succeeded in trumping
George Alagiah and Adam Boulton
alike. The trial even inspired some
program titles – my favourite:
‘Oscar Pistorius: The Sentencing’ –
reminiscent of the cheap thrillers
purchased in airport lobbies,
half-read before swiftly falling into
desuetude.
I must confess that I did not follow
the trial. I don’t know the ins and
outs of the case, the arguments or
the technicalities. I didn’t actually
know the verdict until I googled
the trial for this article. I was, to
be frank, mostly indifferent to an
essentially private affair and slightly
repulsed by the vulgarity of the
coverage. I am dubious about the
propriety of broadcasting a trial from
a country which constitutionally
presumes innocence and I suspect
media coverage does not a little
to undermine formal equality
before the law. These are, however,
subjective impressions and the proper
sociological studies would have to
be made before asserting them with
any confidence. I was disgraced by
a media which can dissect like a
vulture the offcuts of a domestic legal
affair while refusing to broadcast the
devastation of Israeli bombs on the
grounds of ‘respect for the dead’.
The worst of it, however, becomes
apparent if we compare it to
the media response to the state-
sanctioned murder of 34 South
African miners at the Marikana
platinum mine in 2012. A further
78 were injured. If I Google the
words “Marikana platinum mine”
there are 274 thousand hits in
comparison to the 13 million for
“Oscar Pistorius trial”. This though
the Marikana strikes kicked off the
year of greatest protest in South
Africa since Apartheid. This though
two years on no policeman has faced
jail for the use of live ammunition on
fleeing crowds. This though the strike
marked South Africa’s “first post-
apartheid massacre”.
It appears that the mass murder
of black workers in South Africa
and the most important event in the
country’s recent history deserves
a week of coverage – as much
condemnation of the strikers as
sensible analysis – while the violent
“indiscretion” of one of the country’s
ex-‘darlings’ several months. Sadly
this balance will not be redressed
through the major media channels.
There are, however, other ways; next
Wednesday the documentary film
‘Miners Shot Down’ which follows the
events at Marikana is showing at the
Hackney Picturehouse. It would be an
irenic fantasy to expect this to bring
about greater parity, but the more
people who are aware, the more can
be made aware. Book a ticket.
Should we accept reporting of factual errors?

"The cost to
human life will
only increase;
we cannot
afford to be

COMMENT WRITER
at Christie with the contempt we
reserve for homeopaths, or anti-
vaccination advocates. We should
be loudly and obnoxiously picking
apart every single factual error,
every single mote of bad science they
make. Otherwise, we run the risk
of allowing the big decisions to fall
into the hands of people who simply
lack the knowledge and intelligence
to make them. Christie, and the rest
of the GOP run the risk seriously
jeopardizing our ability to effectively
deal with current – and future –
outbreaks.
