TECH EDITOR
Hello there! I’m Osama Awara,the editor who last
year brought you the technology murder list series
with his partner in crime Maximillian Eggl.For my
second year as tech editor,get ready for more reviews
on the latest tech products and top ten tech lists that
will leave you questioning whether that iPhone 6 you
bought was a bent idea.
If you are interested in writing an article for tech,as
a one off or on a regular basis,just send your articles
to me or Jamie via technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
We will make sure your articles are up and running
for the next issue; any positive reviews on Apple
products will be marked as‘junk’.
All jokes aside,please do not hesitate to contact us
about any ideas you have for an upcoming article.
"Expect

leave you
feeling like
you're
gaming on
a flipbook."
The third generation of
Windows tablets, or Lablets
as I like to call them, have
been released by Microsoft. They
claim that the Surface Pro 3 is not
only a tablet, but a laptop as well,
potentially replacing both of those
devices in your home. After owning
one for several weeks, I can honestly
back Microsoft on this one. I have
not touched my old laptop since the
purchase; it is currently sitting in a
bedroom drawer collecting dust.
The beautiful thing about this
device is how seamlessly you can
interchange between using it as a
tablet and a laptop. For instance, as
I write this article I am in desktop
mode tapping away at the keyboard,
whilst being able to touch anywhere
on the screen to select anything from
the Word 2013 and Google Chrome
icons to the volume adjustment icon.
However, by selling the attachable
keyboard separately Microsoft has,
in my opinion, shot itself in the foot,
appearing to be like the [video games
developer] EA of the tech world. I
purchased my Surface Pro 3 with the
core i5 processor and a 256 GB solid
state drive for a relatively hefty price
in Canada. The keyboard sold for
$150 (Canadian dollars that is) which
is around £80 – an unreasonable
extra charge considering the initial
price of the system (around £830).
However, in terms of ergonomics the
keyboard works well and is backlit.
Most of the Surface Pro 3s come
with 256GB of memory which is not
a lot if you are planning to properly
use your device as a laptop. It is
compensated by the fact that this
device is solid state (free of moving
mechanical parts), meaning that
your Surface Pro will have much
faster loading speeds compared to
traditional hard drives which run
on rotating magnetic discs. Also,
if you’re planning to game on this
device, you will certainly fill up your
memory quickly.
On the topic of gaming, the Surface
Pro is very decent for a tablet but if
you are planning to run hardcore
games such as Battlefield, expect
frame rates that would leave you
feeling like you’re gaming on a
flipbook; the integrated graphics card
just won’t be able to handle it.
The tablet has multiple degrees of
positioning due to the flap on the rear
of the device; this gives the Surface
Pro 3 several different modes of use.
If you want the device to work as
a laptop you would position the flap
so that the screen is vertical with a
slight slant. If you are in a lecture and
want to take notes with the Surface
Pro stylus, you can position the flap
such that the screen is positioned
horizontally with a slight vertical
slant – the perfect position to write.
The stylus does a good job at writing
and although your handwriting with
a pen won’t be mimicked, you will
still get reasonable results.
Overall, am I satisfied with the
Surface Pro 3? It definitely checks
both the boxes that a tablet and
laptop should, running everything
Tech-companies want to expand
their product portfolio outside
of smartphones, and with iPad
and tablet sales falling quarter after
quarter and all the variety in screen
sizes pretty much exhausted, where
do they go from here?
For some, the answer to that
question seems to be wearable
technology. The market is still in its
infancy, but sales have tripled in the
last year and are predicted to rise
to 250 million devices sold in 2018.
Apple Watch is certainly next year’s
device to have but with a market as
big as this it’s anyone’s game.
Companies like Samsung and
Pebble have been rushing to lead the
pack; even Google entered the game
just 3 months ago, but with the Apple
Watch imminent for the start of 2015
and Microsoft rumoured to release
its own wearable this holiday season,
things are certainly heating up.
Just 3 million smart-bands and
smartwatches have sold all over
the world up until now – while
companies are still struggling to hit
the right combination of usability,
‘comfortability’, longevity and
most importantly design. With our
lives already surrounded by and so
dependent on our devices, the most
difficult hurdle manufacturers
are facing is actually convincing
consumers that we need another one.
One company who seem to have
found the recipe for success is Pebble.
Before any of the big boys were even
thinking about making a smartwatch,
Pebble was already breaking
crowdfunding records with its own
extremely simplified smartwatch.
It managed to raise 10 million
dollars and take 85,000 orders on
Kickstarter with just a low resolution
black and white LCD display, a simple
plastic design and a price tag of £79.
The company has reported that
more than 400,000 units have been
moved since January 2013, which is
impressive considering how young
the company is.
The Pebble was successful but not
revolutionary, its sensible features
and low price tag appealing mostly to
the tech-savvy niche market without
it ever really going mainstream.
Shortly after, Samsung came along
with the Galaxy Gear, a smartwatch
which tried to do too much without
really getting any of it right.
Samsung’s first smartwatch cost a
ridiculous £299 and it left behind a
lot of displeased tech-reviewers. But
since then the company has managed
to release a total of 6 smartwatches
in just 2 years. Sales numbers are not
very clear but Samsung seems to be
heading up the wearables market
with more than 800,000 total units
sold, a minuscule number when put
in perspective with Samsung’s other
device sales. The Korean company’s
latest effort, the Galaxy Gear S, is
able to act as a standalone device
working independently of a phone.
However, it does not support Android
Wear making it only compatible with
Samsung phones.
Similarly, Sony has released several
wearables but none of them have
managed to cause a real stir in the
market, mostly because they offered
only Sony handset support.
Android Wear seems to be the only
solution to these compatibility issues.
One of its most interesting features is
from Microsoft Office and Netflix
to standard apps downloaded from
the store. It certainly would come in
handy to any student and it also fits
neatly in your bag like a textbook.
The main problem is its price
which stands alongside elite gaming
laptop brands such as Alienware or an
ASUS Gaming Powerhouse. You can
expect to be set back £1400 with the
keyboard if you are going to make a
purchase in the UK.
Surface Pro 3s come at similar
prices to Apple Macs, but I would
definitely recommend the Surface
Pro 3 as the must-have device for
students over Macs, simply because
of its touch screen and laptop/tablet
interchangeability that the Apple
devices lack.
"It
definitely
checks both
the boxes a
tablet and
laptop
should."
its support of round displays giving
manufacturers the opportunity
to produce some gorgeous and
inconspicuous wristwear. LG has
the sleek G Watch R on the pipeline,
while Motorola’s Moto 360 has
been on sale for over a month, even
selling out at one point. It is the first
device to have a round display, and it
has almost no bezels making for an
incredibly attractive design.
Wearable devices are not going
to be hidden away in consumers’
pockets, they are going to be strapped
on our wrists, worn on our faces,
hung around our necks, increasingly
interconnecting with our lives and
more importantly representing who
we are. If manufacturers want the
smartwatch to be the next big thing
they need to be thinking much less
like the tech industry and a little
more like the fashion industry.
