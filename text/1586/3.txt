The RCSU is currently holding a
by-election to replace its Vice-
President (Operations),who
resigned earlier this month due
to reasons of a personal nature.

(formed as a result of splitting
the Events Oficer role in two

The role of Vice-President
(Operations) is a powerful
one,chairing one of the main
committees of the RCSU (the
Operations Board),and also has a
vote on the Executive Committee.

Queenie goes all social on Twitter
KUNAL WAGLE
Her Majesty the Queen sent
her first tweet during a visit
to the Science Museum last
Friday. During the visit she opened
the new Information Age gallery at
the Science Museum.
The tweet, which was the first
tweet to be sent by a reigning British
monarch, read: ‘It is a pleasure to
open the Information Age exhibition
today at the @ScienceMuseum
and I hope people will enjoy
visiting.Elizabeth R.’
The exhibition displays the
“technological breakthroughs
that have transformed how we
communicate.” As part of the
exhibition, the Queen and His Royal
Highness The Duke of Edinburgh
listened to people whose first glimpse
of television was watching the
Coronation in 1953.
The Director of the Science
Museum, Ian Blatchford, said that
Queen Victoria has taken a great
interest in new technology since
the invention of the telephone. He
recalled when she “made the first live
Christmas broadcast in 1957” and was
“the first monarch to send an email,
during a visit to the Royal Signals and
Radar Establishment” on 26 March
1976.
The tweet was retweeted over
41,000 times and favourited over
44,000 times. It wasn’t the first tweet
from the account (
@BritishMonarchy) but it was the
first tweet that she personally had
sent.
The early days of the exhibition
have been extremely well received,
with Baroness Lane Fox saying,
“this gallery reminds me of the
extraordinary ambition of so much
of the UK’s past - from laying the
transatlantic telegraph cable, to the
invention of the World Wide Web. It
therefore throws down the gauntlet
for the future and provides fabulous
inspiration.”
Simon Segars, who is Chief
Executive of ARM, added: “The future
is always nurtured in the minds of
our children and a gallery such as
the Science Museum’sInformation
Agecan inspire them to unleash their
ideas. If just some of the young people
coming to see the exhibition go on to
become engineers and scientists then
we’ve succeeded.”
Imperial College Union’s Deputy
President (Welfare) Chris Kaye, an
ardent follower of the Queen, was on
hand to tell us what he thought of
the news: “It was brilliant to see Her
Majesty take her first steps into the
digital stratosphere. It was so exciting
that our esteemed Monarch came so
close to Imperial College. It reminds
me of a quote she made in 1947: ‘I
declare before you all that my whole
life, whether it be long or short, shall
be devoted to your service and the
service of our great Imperial family
to which we all belong.’” When it
was pointed out that this might not
be about the College, he said that the
quote was “open to interpretation”.
However, the tweet did not escape
controversy. When the BBC reported
on the momentous tweet, they
inadvertently showed a reply by
someone called WolfgangDikface (
@WolfgangDikface), who said “fuck
off”. Dikface then tweeted “Look
mum, I’m famous”, and followed it
up with “New followers: Have a look
round, make yourself comfortable
but telling an 88 year old woman to
f*** off on the BBC is about as good
as i get (sic).” In response to this
Chris Kaye said, “I feel that the only
consequence for people who befoul
SECTION EDITOR
Her Majesty on social media should
be to have their heads on spikes. The
tweet by Mr Dikface could only be
described as treason.”
