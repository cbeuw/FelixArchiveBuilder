Are you interested in
portraiture and the state of
affairs in Italy during the
sixteenth century? Have you ever
wondered how the great masters
like Caravaggio and Velasquez
were inspired? The answers lie
in the Royal Academy’s latest
exhibition, where you are faced
with works from throughout the
life of Giovanni Battista Moroni, a
relatively unknown Italian painter
who was able to capture the likeness
and personality of his sitters with
apparent ease. The portraits are
done with such skill that they seem
to capture precise moments in time;
rather than simply standing in the
room, you are transported back to
late Renaissance Italy.
The rooms are grouped with the
type of sitters Moroni painted, one
of the best being the full-length
portraits of the aristocrats. The
clothes worn by Italy’s top class
are beautifully portrayed, with
extraordinary details such as lace and
pearl beads. As light reflects off the
taffeta skirts or velvet trousers of the
men and women that surround you,
somehow you know exactly how the
material would have felt
One of the brightest pieces – which
happens to be my personal favourite
– is a portrait of Gian Gerolamo
Grumelli. Aptly titled ‘The Man in
Pink’, Grumelli is shown wearing a
Spanish-style tight-fitting jacket with
puffed pantaloons, both beautifully
embroidered with silver, paired with
pink stockings and shoes of the same
vibrant shade. As your eyes adjust
to the colour and detail, you soon
realize that a lot of thought had gone
behind his costume of choice: the
Grumelli’s coat of arms was a coral
branch with the motto “Far from my
tears it reddens and turns to stone”; the
center of the portrait culminates in a
jet-black sword resting in Grumelli’s
hand, depicting him to be a man of
action. Next to him hangs a picture of
his wife at the time – Isotta Brembati
– also dressed in a stunningly
intricate gown. Although being
positioned next to each other, Moroni
illustrates how important each of
the characters were individually, and
keeps the viewers concentrated on
the individual figures through use of
simple grey stone backgrounds, each
tailored specifically to the person’s
identity.
Each character has a different
title and story, drawing you into
the politics and connections each
person had – sometimes with other
individuals hanging just across the
room. As you progress you find
yourself amongst Moroni’s later
works, which are different from the
aristocrats; rather than creating an
elegant air they capture the real life
of the person. The use of tone differs
with a limited palette of colours
used, offset with only a small vibrant
portion of bright hue. As the portraits
stare mysteriously out at you, we
are compelled to know more about
them, with the context adding to the
experience.
This well-crafted exhibition shows
Among the cultural highlights on
the calender for next year, one sticks
out as a particular oddity: March
2015 will see the grand opening of
The National Videogame Arcade
in Nottingham. The £2.5 million
project, which aims to become a draw
for tourists visiting Nottingham,
will be the first of its kind, aining
to become a “hub for videogame
culture”.
The Arcade, which will take
up residence in a 33,000 sq foot
building, will spread its permanent
collection across five entire floors.
A vast majority of the pieces in the
gallery will come from the National
Videogame Archive, a vast collection
numbering 20,000 objects, currently
held by the Science Museum, London.
This will be the first time that
many pieces in the collection will
have been exhibited to the public, a
prospect that excites Ian Livingstone,
a member of the museum’s advisory
board; “for the millions of people who
love them,” said Mr Livingstone, “it is
only natural that videogames should
have their own permanent, cultural
home”.
The announcement comes at a
time of heightened debate about
whether exactly videogames can be
called ‘art’, an issue that has increased
in prominence over the last few
years. Once thought of as only the
preserve of snotty teenage boys, it
has become increasingly apparent
that videogames can present an
exciting artistic medium, with games
such as Flower (2009) and Journey
(2012) showing how developers can
transcend the traditional tropes
that have formed the core of many
videogames, and create something
both beautiful and meaningful.
The argument is not just
constrained to artistic theory either;
economically, games represent a
major force. The UK video game
market is the largest in Europe, and
Grand Theft Auto V (2013), the latest
in the popular series, grossed more
than $1 billion within three days of
its release.
With games representing such
a large presence in the UK, both
culturally and economically, it
seems that the National Videogame
Arcade is the logical next step, and
should help the industry shake off the
long-running stereotypes that have
followed it around for the last three
decades.

us the rare
chance to
immerse
ourselves
fully in
Moroni's
world"
this obscure artist’s progression in
skill throughout his life in regards to
brushstroke, likeness and expression
as well as his use of colour. It not only
displays the works in their full glory,
but also explains details of the sitters’
lives, allowing us the rare chance to
immerse ourselves fully in Moroni’s
wonderful world.
Giovanni Battista Moroni is on at The
Sackler Wing of The Royal Academy,
until 25th January 2015.
Tickets are £12 for adults; £10 for
students; members and under-16s go free.
