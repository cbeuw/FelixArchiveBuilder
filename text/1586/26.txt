Creatures of the Night

Nightcrawler starts off
innocently enough, with
classic shots of the LA skyline
at night, millions of lights fending
off the darkness, before crashing
down to a man cutting through a
wire fence. A police car pulls up,
revealing the face of Lou Bloom (Jake
Gyllenhaal). Gaunt – unnervingly so
– Gyllenhaal is an instantly magnetic
screen presence. A twitching bundle
of nervous energy, speaking in a
high-pitched, nasal patter, his Bloom
is the vehicle for Nightcrawler’s story,
the tale of a man driven to succeed,
a man who uses the vapid, bland
language of ‘management speak’ to
justify his every action, regardless of
the morality – or otherwise – of the
situation.
It’s that absurd contrast – the use
of everyday, borderline meaningless
terminology in the fact of actions
far beyond ordinary situations –
that lends the film a large swathe of
its dark humour, as well as the key
thrust of its satire. The rest of the
humour is found in Bloom’s bluntless
in romantic matters, as he avoids
any sense of tact when dealing with
Rene Russo’s TV producer Nina. This
isn’t a comedy, by any stretch of the
imagination – it’s quite the opposite
– but laughter still slips through the
cracks.
Nightcrawler is most definitely a
satire, however, albeit not the one
you’d expect. Dealing as it does with
the freelance ‘journalists’ running
around with video cameras in L.A.
at night (the titular ‘nightcrawlers’),
filming the results of crimes and
accidents and selling the tapes to
the news, there’s a lot of room to
maneouvre when it comes to taking
potshots at the press. To the film’s
credit, while it takes its fair share
of swipes in that general direction,
it also opens fire on the culture of
business. Bloom’s sole aim – his
entire purpose – is to be in charge
of his own, successful business.
Everything he does, everything he
says, all is in the name of achieving
that goal, morality be damned; which
NIGHTCRAWLER
Director: Dan Gilroy
Screenplay: Dan Gilroy
Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene
Russo, Bill Paxton
is partially why he’s so terrifying.
Despite the sheer amoral
malevolence that Bloom radiates,
the film manages what should be
impossible, twisting the audience’s
sympathies until you actively want
Bloom to succeed. The score by
James Newton Howard is among
the main culprits for this successful
manipulation – never too intrusive,
always simmering in the background,
it subtly toys with traditionally
heroic themes as Bloom succeeds,
quietly suggesting something more
than the obvious scorn and fear the
character deserves.
The sheer number of times Bloom’s
name has already appeared should be
some indication as to how vital he is
to the film – and through that, how
essential Gyllenhaal’s performance is.
It is an utterly transcendent showing,
easily the best performance of his
career so far. It is a Robert de Niro in
Taxi Driver for the modern day, with
strands of de Niro’s performance
in King of Comedy, and it deserves
all of the praise and Oscar buzz it’s
getting. It is not an obvious contender
– very much the dark horse of the
contest – but don’t be surprised to see
Gyllenhaal’s name on more than a
few shortlists come awards season.
When it comes to bringing up
the de Niro/Scorcese films and
Nightcrawler’s obvious heritage in that
department, it’s worth noting that the
film can’t escape other comparisons
to the past, not least to fellow L.A.-
based Drive (it certainly shares a love
of the grimy, the claustrophobic, the
dark, seedy side of the city), but it
still manages to rise above the risk of
appearing solely derivative, instead
becoming something so much more.
Credit for this must almost
certainly go in no small part to writer/
first-time director Dan Gilroy, a
man previously responsible for the
screenplay/story for the likes of
The Bourne Legacy and Real Steel:
nothing particularly terrible, but
nothing – nothing – quite like this.
It’s a confident debut, utilising all the
tricks of the trade, and still finding
room for minor innovations to ensure
the film never slows down or feels
old. There’s a vast array of glorious
shots, occasional flashes of symbolism
that demand this film be rewatched,
studied, dissected. Not something you
could say about Real Steel.
There’s a lot more to be said about
Nightcrawler. The supporting cast
are universally excellent, but all
so overshadowed by Gyllenhaal
that it’s hard to pick one out. The
cinematography is perfect, oozing
sleaze and grime in every shot, but
it all comes back to the leading
performance, and the writer/
director behind it. This is Gilroy and
Gyllenhaal’s moment. And if this
should prove to be another Scorcese/
de Niro style partnership, long may it
continue.
ANNABELLE

JOHN PARK
SECTION EDITOR
Why someone in their right
mind would want to take
home a doll that looks
like Annabelle is anyone’s guess.
But Mia (Annabelle Wallis) cannot
seem to contain her joy when her
doctor husband John (Ward Horton)
surprises her with this new addition
to her doll collection. But one night,
the couple is attacked in a home
invasion attempt by a pair of violent
lunatic cult members. The police get
there on time, a remarkable rarity
in horror films – or in any film
for that matter, the intruders are
killed, after which the doll ends up
possessed by an evil demonic spirit
(even the demon knows which sinister
looking toy to go for when it decides
to hang around) of the female cult
member named Annabelle, and it is
all downhill from there for the once
happy couple.
As is usually the case with
demons, there is a whole host of
weird and wonderful things that
start happening. As the young
mother begins to struggle with
the supernatural haunting of her
house, the doctor husband who is
supportive but hardly ever home and
misses much of the action, thinks
she is unwell, and advises rest and a
professional to speak with.
Granted, there are some spooky
moments that work well. It helps that
the doll itself is quite the disturbing
looking creation, and especially when
it starts doing its own evil things the
terror that mounts up momentarily is
effective.
It is a shame, however, that
Annabelle herself does not take the
initiative to start killing everyone
around her like Chuky did in Child’s
Play.
A young girl and an older woman,
both dressed in ragged, bloody sheets
just will not leave Mia alone. There
appears to be something rising from
the darkness, a powerful force of
darkness whose strength is getting
bigger every day. It is all familiar
stuff, but the scares do remain the
highlight of The Conjuring prequel.
The trouble is that there simply
are not enough for it to sustain
the running time, even though the
film only runs for 99 minutes. It is
particularly disappointing to see such
an uneventful finale using appalling
supporting characters who randomly
go in and out of the protagonists’
lives.
The worst written role here is
Evelyn’s (Alfre Woodard). As a wiser,
older lady, she gives useful advice,
only to throw it all away in the end by
being literally tossed aside. Woodard
gives the film its much needed
emotional core, but her scenes never
follow through to amount to anything
special.
Very little makes sense in the end,
not that you would expect a horror
film to have much logic running
through in its script, but with
Annabelle, the sheer lack of coherence
is too significant to ignore.
