For most people the thought
of attending Union Council
is not good – to be honest,
most people don’t even know what
Council is – but for those who do it
is often thought of as a chore and is
an evening that they would rather
spend elsewhere. Personally I rather
enjoy the process of locking people
in a room until they come to an
agreement on some important issues.
Tuesday’s Council Meeting (the
second one this year) was true to
form; it had the usual mix of papers,
reports, lots of arguing and generally
getting a numb bottom from sitting
around for some time on hard seats;
but it also had the delightfully
amusing spectacle of members
having to get up and walk to opposing
sides of the room to vote – left for
yes, right for no, and standing in
the middle for an abstention. To
add to the confusion, the matter
under discussion was about how
Council votes and whether the votes
of individual members should be
recorded, with the number of sub-
points to be voted upon constantly
changing. As a candidate that ran
against Paul Beaumont (Chair of the
meeting) for the job of shepherding
Council, I am not sure if I’m glad I
didn’t have the job of trying to deal
with the chaos or not.
Another wonderful product of the
meeting is that the Union’s Executive
Committee now has no members,
does not meet and does not have
any remit whatsoever – this is to get
around the rule that Council can’t get
rid of the Exec but has decided that it
has no function.
I reckon that this has been one of
the most fun-filled Council meetings
with yet more prime examples of
how Council is bad at its job, and that
sadly is why I am upset. Don’t get me
wrong, I do think Council can be fun,
and it doesn’t need to take forever;
but when people bemoan the fact
that they have to attend a two hour
meeting as an elected representative
(which they chose to run for) which
has massive power over how our
Union is run, I get quite worked up.
Council is an important part of
the Union’s structure, regardless of
whether you know or care about it.
If you are on Council then you have
decided to run for a position that
means you have to be at Council, so
turn up, and express opinions.
I do not consider that a two hour
meeting is that long, and when even
the Chair of the meeting complains
about the length or apologises for
the same, then all that happens is
you reinforce the image that Council
is too long and is boring. Read the
papers, engage with the debate, and
accept that there will be some items
of business that don’t necessarily
directly impact on you.
Whilst the spectacle of some of
the brightest minds in the Country
having to resort to walking to
opposing sides of the wrong to add
up who votes yes (or doesn’t vote)
is fun to watch, the general farce
that surrounded the debate and the
final decision of sending a group
away to research something that was
researched last year and to come back
and report on whether something
is feasible despite a general lack of
interest in adopting the new approach
is ridiculous and sad. Surely we can
actually produce a series of decisions
that makes coherent and logical
sense, with a final outcome which
actually achieves something.
What Council needs is a change of
attitude – especially amongst some
of its members. It needs to recognise
that it has a big role, that spending
40 minutes debating something is
productive (assuming good chairing)
and that for the amount of power
and responsibility it has, taking
the time to do things properly with
clear resolutions to vote on is the
way things should be done, and
that means that the meetings may
be longer than people may be used
to. The real test will be whether the
attendance of members of Council
continues to be high over the course
of the year, and whether it once again
will struggle to achieve the level
of attendance to it needs to make
decisions (something it struggles with
every year).
What we as members of the Union
need to do is discuss the topics that
are coming to Council, engage with
them and tell them what the issues
are for us, what we think the cost of
University degrees should be, and
ask them whether they had fun at the
last Council meeting. You could even
come along yourself and contribute,
you may find it fun – I do.
