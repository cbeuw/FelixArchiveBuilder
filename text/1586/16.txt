"To
summarise,
this game
is good
fun. It
definitely
doesn't
take
itself too
seriously."
Are you alright? The guy next
to me leans over and asks, a
worried look on his face. Crap.
He’s on to me. I’m playing Lords of
the Fallen, a Hack ‘n’ slash heavily
influenced by Dark Souls. When I
play games of this intensity, I start
mouth breathing pretty heavily (think
combination of Darth Vader and
nervous stoat), eventually graduating
into continuous angry muttering. I
would feel bad for my neighbour, but
I’m too busy getting killed for the 33rd
time, and saying unprintable things
about the mother of the First Boss.
Lords of the Fallen is a blast.
You are Harkyn, a criminal in a
world where no sins are forgotten
(literally tattooed on your face, in fact).
The rulers of the world are apparently
close to banishing evil from humans
(which sounds like it might involve
lots of brainwashing and murder, but
whatever). However, an ancient enemy,
a broken God, has decided to attack the
human realm with his army of demons.
Harkyn has been offered a chance at
redemption. He must use his sins and
beat back the army. I can tell you from
the 2+ hours I played, that this involves
little diplomacy but lots of murdering
everything you see with a hammer.
This is the story from the official
website. It’s is revealed slowly, and I
spent most of the time being brutalised
by the sword of the second boss, so I
can’t really comment on how accurate
it is. What I can tell you about is the
gameplay. It would be difficult to talk
about any part of Lords of the Fallen
without mentioning Dark Souls (a
Hack ‘n’ Slash notorious for its brutal
difficulty). If you’ve already played it,
then the game will seem very familiar
to you. The mechanics, the storytelling,
the art style and the general feel of
the game are all pretty similar. You
do get a real sense however, that
while the developers have been quite
conservative with their core design,
they really have tried to embellish the
old formula. It also looks very, very
pretty running on a PS4.
The most notable difference is the
fact that the difficulty is slightly less
intense. This doesn’t mean it’s easy. I
was allowed to record my game session,
and I died a total of 72 times (this is
partly due to the fact that I had to use
a controller, which I suck ass at using.
I think at one point I was just doing
forward rolls for about 3 minutes).
When you die, your experience from
your previous life is slowly depleted,
unless you find your “ghost”, upon
which the remaining XP is restored.
XP can be banked at checkpoints to
upgrade your attributes and skills.
However, If you choose to play balls-
to-the-wall you can keep the XP,
increasing your multiplier, but with
the risk of losing all of it if you die and
can’t find your ghost.
There are six potential classes,
ranging from the lumbering tank of
the warrior, to the extremely quick
and fragile rogue. There are also
the usual multitude of weapon and
armour options, allowing for a lot of
customisation. The core mechanic of
Your name is Giorgio Manos.

cash, but there’s a twist… literally. You
don’t just drive the way your wheels
are pointing (what would be the point
in that?), your limousine is constantly
spinning while you attempt to navi-

However,thisgameisnotwithout
the game appears to be thus: Die, try a
different strategy and combination of
gear, rinse and repeat until you find
one that works. This sounds dull. It’s
not. The balance on the game is very
well done-at the start it’s all absurdly
frustrating, but this evaporates fairly
quickly, and you start feeling like an
unconquerable badass. Naturally, the
game punishes your hubris, and kills
you again. But importantly, when you
die, it usually feels like it was because
you did something stupid, rather than
the game.
There are a couple of weaknesses.
I only played for a couple of hours,
so I couldn’t really get into the story.
However, from first glance it does seem
a bit derivative, and the gameplay is
very linear. Harkyn is gruff white male
with dirty past/beard combo #3712,
but that’s not specific to Lords of the
Fallen. In addition, considering the
number of control options, the PC port
is almost certainly going time, and
saying unprintable things about the to
be horrendous, but you can always play
with a controller.
There are problems certainly – it
feels a bit too close to Dark Souls,
the learning curve is initially very
steep and profoundly frustrating.
But there are moments when, after a
change in strategy, you hit the sweet
spot, get the perfect combo and crush
some demonic’ warlords face in with
a huge hammer, that I guarantee you
feel like the most powerful guy on
the planet. And when you inevitably
die a minute later, instead of rage
quitting you just mutter “I’ll piss on
your corpse, fucker” then jump back
in. The feeling of success after intense
effort is profoundly satisfying, and
unbelievably fun. In the end, that’s all I
want from a game.
