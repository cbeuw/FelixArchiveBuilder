Diary Of a Fresher, aged 18 3/4
Sunday 26th October
I spent all of this weekend trying to chat to Dorothy, but every time I wanted to speak to her I sort of fell
over awkwardly. By ‘sort of’, dear diary, I literally tripped over my laundry basket and chipped my tooth on
the washing machine. She then fainted at the sight of my blood and then another girl started screaming
and I blacked out.
Monday 27th October
So it turns out when I blacked out one of the wardens came in to ﬁnd two people comatose, one person
screaming and blood everywhere and things didn’t look great. I’ve missed two lectures today having to explain
myself to College tutors. I hope I didn’t miss anything cool.
Tuesday 28th
My jaw feels so much better now, also my tooth looks kinda cool chipped, I reckon Dorothy will dig my new
scarred look. If only I could get her to speak to me.
Wednesday 29th
Halls Haloween party on friday getting really excited. I reckon this will be where I can really get a chance
to talk to her. Jennifer won’t answer my Skypes, I’m begining to doubt Newcastle has been without Inter-
net for 3 weeks...
Thurs 30th
OMG got my outﬁt planned, gonna go as zombie Spiderman. I’ll let you know how it goes diary.
Friday 31st
OMG I”M SO SAD. Half the people at the halloween party turned up as blood-soaked washing machines.
Then a Snapchat account called NewcastleBanterLad sent me pictures of MY NOW EX Jennifer making
out with some football lads with the caption “Spiderman Suxx loser”. I ran to my room crying. Excuse me
diary, there’s someone at the door, I’ve told them to fuck off. Wait... Hang on... it’s Dorothy.....
