Where the hell did this come from?
Dan Harmon’s beloved sitcom
Community has long been
known to fans as a ‘genre’
show smuggled onto our screens
under the disguise of a regular
comedy about a community college.
In Adult Swim cartoon Rick and
Morty, co-creator Dan Harmon has
done the opposite – he’s managed
to smuggle an earnest, real family
drama out to us under the disguise
of a wacky, high-concept sci-fi
adventure series.
I’ll prove it. Here’s two versions of
the premise:
1. Rick is a genius scientist who
goes on exciting, dimension-hopping
adventures with his reluctant teenage
grandson Morty.
2. Beth is a woman with an on-
the-rocks marriage to the guy who
knocked her up at prom. One day, her
estranged, deadbeat dad (who happens
to be a genius scientist) shows up at
her door asking to live with her. After
she agrees he becomes somewhat of
a surrogate father to her teenage son,
Morty, much to the chagrin of his
actual dad.
If “Rick the scientist, Morty
the teenager” sounds familiar, it
should. The show began its life as an
(incredibly lewd) internet cartoon
short called Doc and Marty, in yet
another parody of the famous Back to
the Future duo. Knowing that helps to
put the show in its context, and shed
light on the exact conversation it’s
having with nerd culture.
The brilliance of Rick and Morty is
in how it seems to exist in a quantum
superposition of the two premises.
Obviously ‘using sci-fi adventures to
talk about real relationships’ is some
Writing 101 stuff – of course your sci-
fi show should be grounded in human
drama! But the magic is in how
naturally it all flows. It strikes the
perfect balance between sly winking,
lampshading itself/various genre
tropes, and playing those tropes just
straight enough to wring the human
drama out of it. It’s never cheap. It’s
never obvious. Every episode keeps
you guessing. And yet here’s that
word again, it’s just so earnest.
But that’s not to belittle the sci-fi
elements. The show may delight
in parodying sci-fi concepts to hell
and back (“my grandpa’s a magic
scientist!” would be the end of the
story in a kids’ show, but being on
Adult Swim the show has a healthy
dose of cynicism to temper it), but
it’s clearly done from a place of love,
and you end up with some pretty
interesting stuff like a Jurassic Park
parody in the form of a theme park
of various diseases, but miniaturised
and inside a hobo’s body.
All of this culminates in what is
without doubt the best episode, Rixty
Minutes. To a cynic, the premise of the
episode is just ‘Rick and co. watch TV’.
And the fact that it’s more than that
is a testament to the strength of the
show. The setup is that Rick upgrades
the family’s cable box to get channels
from ‘every dimension’, and yes,
much of the episode is the content of
those channels in the form of short
vignettes… yet the whole escapade
is just setup for the ‘real’ story: one
channel is from a dimension where
the parents, Beth and Jerry, aborted
the elder daughter, Summer, never
got married, and Jerry became a
movie star (and they see a movie he’s
in). Ouch.
This leads the parents to explore
various dimensions where their
lives seem to be a lot better by never
getting married, and leads to Summer
learning for the first time that they
even considered aborting her.
Part of the resolution is an out-
of-nowhere moment of profundity
from Morty, which involves him
unexpectedly calling back to the
traumatic events of a previous
episode which involved him burying
a dead duplicate of himself, finally
remarking: “Nobody exists on
purpose; nobody belongs anywhere;
everybody’s gonna die. Come watch
TV.”
This is all to say nothing of the
vignettes themselves, all of which
were ad-libbed in their entirety by
the writers. This is rare in animation.
Usually by the time voice recording
Tom Rivlin looks at Rick and Morty in the Cartoon Corner
"Nobody
belongs
anywhwere;
everybody's
gonna
die. Come
watch TV. "
"My
grandpa's
a magic
scientist!"
starts the storyboards are finalised
and animation has begun, leaving
little ‘wiggle room’ for improv.
Here, clearly the storyboards
were drawn around the improv
sessions, a difficult feat. The results
speak for themselves. Each vignette
is weird, free-flowing, creative
and totally hilarious. Some are
downright Lovecraftian, or perhaps
Cronenbergian, as Rick would put it.
The incredible thing about Rick and
Morty is that this is all done in only
eleven 22-minute episodes in the
first season. Already (but really, from
the start) the show has found a clear
voice/tone, has a message to say and
knows just how to say it.
It’s returning for a second season
this year. Hopefully, like Community,
it will last six seasons and a movie.
