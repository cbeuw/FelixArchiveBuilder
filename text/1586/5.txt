Wednesday night played
host to the first Athlet-
ics Clubs’ Committee
Sports night of the year. The evening,
themed around S & M (Sadomaso-
chism) or M & S (Marks and Spencer),
saw an estimated 350 online sales and
around twice as many on the door.
Initial figures suggest that over
1,100 people attended the event,
approaching the total capacity of the
Union bars.
Tickets were £8.50 in advance and
£9.50 on the door. This covered the
entry fee and the cost of four drinks,
including beers and bombs. Online
tickets sold out three days prior to
the event, for the first time in the
history of the infamous ACC bar
nights. £6,500 was taken on the door
alone, with £16,000 taken at the bar.
One ACC committee member told
Felix: “The only hitch was when
people were dancing on the stage, and
one bouncer got a bit lairy. However,
big dog Sam the bouncer sorted it all
out.”
“Apart from that, it was banging.”
The night kicked off around 8pm,
and by 11pm the bar queues were
four or five people deep. Despite the
rather flexible theme, many people
chose to come dressed in various
costumes completely unrelated to
bondage or stereotypical pensioner
attire.
It is rumoured only one fresher
truly committed to the theme,
turning up in sparkling hot pants
and a thin white string vest. When
asked if he was cold, he declined to
comment.
One particularly brave individual
came with his face covered in duct
tape. Felix offers their condolences
towards this individual who had to
remove that at the end of the night.
Many people also wore M & S
plastic bags, although it is unsure
whether this was a display of irony or
plain laziness.
With a burger stall positioned
outside until the late hours of the
evening, and the Christian Union on
hand to give out free tea and coffee,
the night was an amicable affair.

The Christian Union in particular
has been heralded as an exemplary
presence, and even helped some
people return home safely.
The night was organised by the
committee members of ACC in
conjunction with the managers of the
We’ve all taken some pretty
shocking selfies we regret
the next morning, but I’m
willing to bet none of you have ever
screwed yourselves over to the extent
of these guys, who were sentenced to
prison on Friday when police seized
phones containing pictures of them
posing with wads of cash and sacks of
mary-jane.
The gang of five from North
Kensington were raided at dawn
by police, after being put under
surveillance for suspected drug
trafficking and their connection to
recent violent attacks thought to be
linked to West London gang-banging.
They managed to retrieve half a kilo
of cannabis, as well as some bags of
crack and cocaine, worth a few grand
on the street.
The last time the city saw crime of
this calibre was the fated ‘Basmati
Rice Thief’ of the 2011 London
riots, who took an uncannily similar
picture to our incarcerated friends,
but of himself with a kilo of Tesco
value in his arms.
Detective Constable Helen Lomas
spoke on the case: “These convictions
are a real win for the communities
of Kensington and Chelsea and its
residents who have been blighted
by the intolerable annoyance of this
gang.” She added “These individuals
used their mobile phone cameras to
gloat about their success in illegal

A man has been found dead by
a church just north of High Street
Kensington station.
Paramedics and firefighters were
called to the scene after a passer by
discovored the body at around 6:35
on Wednesday morning.
The body was discovered in
Kensington Church Walk, an alley
by St Mary Abbots Church, and
pronounced dead upon the fire
brigade’s arrival at the scene.
Police are not treating the death
as suspicious, but an investigation
continues. No comment was provided
regarding the theory that the man
slipped and fell while trying to climb

decided on the theme because “it
would be quite funny for people to
actually turn up in bondage wear.”
The next ACC bar night is in
November, the theme is yet to be
confirmed.

an area known as a sleeping spot for
homeless people in the area.
A Parks Police Constable
acknowledged an awareness of
homeless people in the area, naming
it as “a growing problem which we are
tackling.”
Reports of the man’s age vary
between 38 and around 55.
The Metropolitan Police have
stated that they know who the man is,
but are waiting for more information
and confirmation that the family
has been informed before releasing
further details.
Local residents have expressed their
relief that the students at the nearby
school are currently on half term
– although Kensington High Street
remains busy during the day.
