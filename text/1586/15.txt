Last week, it was reported that
Darek Fidyka, a man from
Poland, had begun to walk.
He had been paralyzed from the
chest down since 2010 after a knife
attack. His recovery was hailed as
‘more impressive than man walking
on the moon’ by Geoffrey Raisman,
whose research at University College
London almost 30 years ago made
Fidyka’s recovery possible.
Many decades of research and trials
have gone into spinal cell repair
techniques, but few have yielded
successful results. Until now it was
commonly thought that paralysed
patients would unlikely to ever walk
again. This is because the nerve
cell axons that connect the rest
of the body to the brain, allowing
movement and sensation, are
notoriously difficult to repair once
damaged. The body’s natural healing
process forms a thick glial scar over
the injured region that inhibits
the regeneration of nerve axons,
permanently severing connection
to the brain, and so sensation and
movement are lost.
Professor Raisman’s research
in 1985 showed that the nerve
connection to the brain following
spinal injury could be regained in
mice following transplantation of
olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)
into the injured spinal cord.
OECs are support cells in the body’s
complex circuitry for the sense of
smell. This neural circuitry is the
only part of the human nervous
system that regenerates throughout
adult life. This is because each odour
we encounter is transmitted back to
the olfactory bulbs at the top of the
nasal cavity by nerves in the nose.
These nerves are constantly being
damaged and need to be replaced.
OECs facilitate this regeneration
process.
A research team led by Dr Pawel
Tabakow, a consultant neurosurgeon
at Wroclaw University Hospital, has
built on this concept by transplanting
OECs to the site of injury on Mr
Fidyka’s spinal cord. The team
removed one of the patient’s
olfactory bulbs and used it to derive a
culture containing OECs.
The cultured OECs were then
transplanted into the spinal cord
stumps above and below the injury
in 100 micro injections, and the
eight millimeter gap created by the
knife wound was bridged by four
strips of nerve from Mr Fidyka’s leg.
The transplanted nerve acted as a
scaffold and the OECs allowed the
nerve axons in the spine to regrow. As
all the cells came from the patient’s
body, there was no risk of rejection.
Following the surgery, Mr Fidyka
has undergone intense physiotherapy
almost every day. After just three
months his doctors noticed that
he had gained muscle mass in his
left thigh. Six months later, he was
able to begin to take his first steps
using parallel bars and the help of a
physiotherapist.
Now, 19 months later, he is able to
walk outside the rehabilitation centre
using a frame. He has regained some
sensation in his left leg, and his bowel
function has improved.
Imaging has shown that the grafts
had bridged the left side of the spinal
cord, where the majority of the nerve
grafts were implanted.
None of the researchers want to
profit from the discovery. Professor
Raisman has said “it would be my
proudest boast if I could say that no
patient had had to pay one penny
for any of the information we have
found.”
It is to be noted that the two
patients treated previously with
this technique by Dr Tabakow did
not regain function. The scientists
are hoping to recreate Mr Fidyka’s
success in another ten patients in
Poland and Britain over the coming
years, research grants permitting.
It could take many years for the
technique to become mainstream, but
until now there has been little hope
for paralysis patients to regain their
independence. What is doubtless is
that Mr Fidyka’s tentative steps have
meant a giant leap for mankind.

The Ebola outbreak has claimed
about 4,900 lives to date,
mostly in the poverty-stricken
countries in West Africa — Sierra
Leone, Liberia and Guinea. As the
death toll and number of cases rise ex-
ponentially, scientists are scrambling
to develop treatments that would stop
this epidemic, which Oxfam describes
as a “humanitarian disaster”. Until
there are vaccines approved by the
FDA, standard public health contain-
ment measures will be used to control
the situation.
The Ebola virus is particularly
adept at evading our immune system,
and among the proteins which play a
role in it are VP35 and VP24. VP35
assembles into a dimer and then
coats the RNA backbone of the virus
to prevent detection by the immune
system. VP24 blocks the cellular
production of interferons, molecules
which signal the presence of the virus.
The receptor site of the virus remain
hidden beneath its glycoprotein
branches, also to avoid recognition,
until the branches attach to the host
cell and allow the virus’ penetration
and entry. Another characteristic
in its favour is the filament-like struc-
ture of Ebola virus particles which
gives it a large surface area to attack
many cells.
The virus starts by infecting the
leukocytes, then nearly all other cell
types, which leads to death less than
16 days after the onset of the disease.
The first symptoms include fever and
headache, followed by severe stomach
pains, sore throats and bloody diar-
rhoea as the virus multiplies. The
infected cells then attach to the ves-
sels and arteries, weakening them and
resulting in haemorrhage.
In hopes of sparing more Africans
from this unbearable pain, a massive
research effort has begun to discover
ways to defeat the Ebola virus. A vac-
cine known as ChAd3 is a chimpanzee
cold virus vector incorporated with
ebolavirus gene segments. Along with
another vaccine called VSV, it was ob-
served to give durable immunity and
both vaccines are currently undergo-
ing clinical trials.
Recently, the Wyss Institute of
Harvard University announced their
ongoing work on a biospleen device
which may (or may not) obviate the
need for vaccines. The device acts
rather like a spleen, filtering viruses
from the blood using a magnet. This
has brought hope for the treatment of
Ebola, but its development and test-
ing would take months or years.
There is also the possibility of the
Ebola virus mutating to become more
virulent or infective, in which case it
would outrace the current efforts of
targeting the current virus strain.
Now we can only hope that treat-
ments will be available soon, and that
the Ebola virus will not become too
prolific until the situation gets out
of control. All this shows us the para-
doxical nature of viruses, which are
such simple organisms yet so difficult
to control. The Ebola virus causes uncontrollable internal bleeding
