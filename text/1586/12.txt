Bernadett: Where are you from?
Pascal: I’m from Belgium, born in
Brussells but my family is German.
B: Do you think that the Sabb
team can accurately represent the
international student population
of Imperial?
P: The Sabb team is not as diverse as
we hoped it to be, or as we could be,
but in the end it’s down to who runs
and who gets elected.
B: Do you think that international
students want different things
from their education, because
they're paying more etc?
P: On the whole, there is a higher
turnout of non-international
students for sports and arts societies.
But the international societies are
popular with international students.
And the main difference seems to
be between level of commitment
students want to offer a society i.e. to
just be members of a society rather
than committee members who are
involved with running the clubs.
B: So do you think to justify the
amount of money some of the
students are paying for their
education, education at Imperial
should be improved? For example,
NSS (National Student Survey)
result (2014) for "assessment and
feedback" was 124th in the HE
sector.
P: That was one of my manifesto
points. However, with improving
feedback, you can’t definitively
pinpoint when feedback improves,
the outcome may only be seen in
a few years’ time, when student
satisfaction results improve.
B: I've heard that different
academic departments at Imperial
make different kinds of mistakes
every year. But the mistakes
seem to be consistent for each
department.
Would it not be better to
integrate the faculties so that all
the problems are solved?
P: We can’t do that because every
department is autonomous. It has
benefits, because every department
generally finds what works best for
itself. One of the issues of integrating
all faculties would be to do with
standardising.
B: What other manifesto points did
you have?
P: One was to improve e-learning,
to provide lecture recordings (the
completion of this aim is more
tangible) and maybe extend it to
Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs).
The other manifesto point was
to integrate with the postgrad
population of Imperial, because of
Imperial’s large postgrad population
(55%undergrads, 45%postgrads).
B: Why do you not think the
postgrads are as engaged?
P: Extracurricular activities are less
important for postgrads, their main
priority is their research. They tend
to view being involved in the student
Union as extra workload and tend to
see their CV benefits less.
