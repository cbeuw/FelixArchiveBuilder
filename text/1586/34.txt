Philippa Skett’s basement is
teaming with creepy crawlies.
In other news, the Felix office
now has pet stick insects. The small
bugs are making things rather
uncomfortable down there, however
the stick insects are proving very
popular with the writers and editors.
One reporter was quoted as saying
“it’s really sad that these parasitic
life forms mean we all have to get
tested weekly, and the atmosphere
of antiseptic spray in the room is
making my eyes water; however I’m
a big fan of the new pets we have,
they’re great.”
No one is quite sure who gave them
to whom, “I think it was probably
Crisis has broken out at the
Student Activities Centre,
where a lack of printer paper
has lead to guerrilla warfare between
clubs and societies at Imperial.
The printer, which is often used
for printing millions of pages of
coursework and the odd flyer for
Imperial Cinema, ran out of paper
after a particularly large print job
sent by Annabel Apple, a third year
biologist, who accidentally printed
the entire human genome instead of a
sponsorship contract for her club.
Divisions have already started
appearing throughout campus.
Outdoor Club have teamed up
with Medics Football to build a
barricade around what is rumoured
to be a “substantial” cache of paper
somewhere near the Central Services
office.
Meanwhile, RCS Motor Club’s
Jezebel has been seen to be driving
into the doors of the Queen’s Tower
to see if there is any of this rare
commodity to be found within.
Jazz & Rock, Assassins, and Cheese
Society simultaneously stormed
the Blue Cube, apparently finding
a large stash under the desk of a
certain Philip Power.
Over at other campuses, the
CGCU have taken over Charing
Cross, replacing the Phoenix flag
hanging off Reynolds with their
own. However, when pointed out to
the CGCU that the SAC is based at
South Kensington, they felt rather
embarrassed and left their mascots
behind when they left, later picked
up by the RCSU.
The RSM have been capitalising
on the mayhem and destruction
happening across campus by
organising a bar night. Vice-
President (Activities) Tor Tennant
told Felix, “Well, we may as well
get pissed while this is all going
on! #yolo” Rumours that the
Union Shop will be releasing a
commemorative t-shirt may be
exaggerated.
Felix Editor, Philippa Skett,
accidentally told Hangman that
Felix owned a printer and some
paper. Upon this news becoming
public, she was lynched and then
subjected to the ancient punishment
of being hung, drawn and quartered
at dawn outside Huxley. Her
remains was later paraded down the
burning streets to much delight.
Deputy President (Betrayal)
was seen cackling manically and
swinging from the Union flagpole,
commanding those to join “the
uprising.”
Union President Wom Theeler
pleaded for calm around campus
during the ongoing warfare.
Standing atop the Sherfield
Building, he promised free pizzas
to anyone who laid down their
Society’s weapons and join him in an
open forum regarding bursaries.

DISASTER: Union Printer Paper supply runs Dri
the late night copy editing session
we had last Wednesday” a Deputy
President of Welfare told Hangman
under the conditions of anonymity.
“We were all in quite a funny mood.
An argument about the appropriate
length of an en-dash got everyone
rather animated.
One thing lead to another and
frankly I don’t want to go into too
many details, there were about 8 of
us in there so it was hard to know
who was coming and who was going,
let along who was carrying any eggs.
Anyway the next morning we all
realised that half of Felix’s basement
areas were just full of these bugs.”
The DPW then went on to say, “it’s
a pleasant tonic though that these
stick insects turned up though, they’re
excellent fun”.
Hangman tried to interview
Philippa about the arrival of the bugs,
but all we could hear through the
toilet door were screams of “it burns,
it burns” and the sound of cream
being applied liberally to the affected
areas. However she was spotted in
Beit Quad later shuffling awkwardly
and collecting leaves and twigs,
presumably for the new arrivals.
Rumours still abound about
Felix getting a pet cat, and frankly
Hangman cannot wait for the terrible
pun opportunities that arise from the
word “pussy”.

Library Taking The Piss
This week a faux-Dulux colour
chart was spotted by the toilets
on the third floor of the Central
Library.
The chart encourages students to
monitor their hydration levels by
checking their wee hue against the
hand colour scale.
Student’s with piss in the Fosters to
Stella colour range are doing just fine.
If your wee is veering more towards a
shade of Aspall’s or Blackthorns, you
are advised to imbibe some water post
haste.
If your urine is Newcastle Brown
Ale or worse, you are thoroughly
advised to get a couple of pints of
water down you right now.
If your piss comes out as a colour
not included on the useful chart
you are advised to call a doctor or
mortician.
