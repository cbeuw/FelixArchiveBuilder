Rugby team hits the headlines over
stripping on tube platforms
Philippa Skett on the misbehaviour of Medic and IC Rugby members
The Imperial College
Rugby First XV team have
been suspended pending
investigation into reports that team
members were stripping on a District
Line train.
The behaviour led to the train being
terminated at Stamford Brook. All
passengers were then told to leave the
train, and the police were called to the
station.
The team, under the impression
that the train was terminated due to a
signal failure, left the station unaware
of the unwanted attention they had
attracted.
The reports, made in the Evening
Standard, described how the tube
train was taken out of service after
playing the Rugby players started
a “booze-fuelled stripping game on
board.”
Members of the team were seen
stripping on Richmond station,
engaging in a game where they run
onto the platform, strip to their
boxers, then re-dress before the train
doors close and the train pulls out
again.
The group were identified due to
their kit, which bore the Imperial
College Rugby emblem. Team
members were also seen to be
swigging wine whilst on the tube.
A TfL spokeswoman said: “At
around 5.30pm yesterday a train
was held for about eight minutes
at Stamford Brook station due to a
customer incident.”
“It was then emptied of passengers
and de-trained. The British Transport
Police were called.”
A British Transport Police
spokeswoman said: “Our officers were
called to Stamford Brook London
Underground station shortly after
17.30 on Wednesday, 29th
October,
to reports of a group of naked men
on a District Line train between
Richmond and Upminster.”
James Cox, the first XV Captain,
spoke to Felix. Cox said, “ We would
like to clarify that this was an
independent occurrence, it did not
happen as a group. It was purely
people acting out independent of the
rugby team.
“This behaviour is completely out
of nature, and steps will be taken to
ensure it doesn’t happen again. Those
involved will be disciplined, and I
apologise on behalf of the club for
any upset caused.”
Imperial College Union has
suspended the team until an
investigation takes place to establish
exactly what happened.
The team in question has already
met with the Union to start the
process, although it could be a
while before the team plays again.
The Sabbatical team will lead the
investigation, although there is no
definitive answer as to when the
investigation will be completed.
This follows from an incident last
week, when an anonymous source
revealed to Felix that the Medics 3rd
Rugby Team were caught on camera

running around naked, and urinating
and vomiting at Heston.
The footage was released to the
Union, who are now investigating the
matter, although it is uncertain as to
what the consequences maybe for the
team at this time.
The cameras, installed for security
reasons around the Heston ground,
caught the footage. On screen,
members of the team were identified,
and as a result, are under a self-
imposed ban to not drink at the venue
for the next two months.
Abi de Bruin, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) said that
the Union will be launching an
investigation next week into the
Heston incident too.
The event occurred after the
team were drinking at the Heston
bar, named the Teddington Bar,
or “Teddy’s”, in a nod towards the
former medic sports ground that
closed earlier this year. The team
members then proceeded to run
around the grounds naked.
Tom Wheeler, President of
Imperial College Union, said to Felix:
“Dariush [Medic’s Student Union
President] and I are engaging with
the Club Captain and Team Captain
to ensure that a decent standard of
behaviour is abided by when students
are participating in Club-related
social events.”
“Potential sanctions have not yet
been decided, however continued
poor behaviour such as this could
result in punitive measures, such
as reduction in or expulsion from
BUCS.”
Representatives from Sport
Imperial were unavailable for
comment.
