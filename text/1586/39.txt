THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 39
FELIX
Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle
31.10.2014
It was cold and windy last
Wednesday afternoon when 25
members of the Imperial Cross
Country and Athletics Club arrived
at Hampstead Heath to take on the
other London Colleges in the first
Cross Country race of the season:
Parliament Hill.
With their shiny new red & blue
Imperial vests in hand, the newest
members of the club were ready
to represent their Uni against the
masses of UCL, Kings, Brunel and St.
Mary’s to name but a few.
The London College League (LCL)
is a series of six cross country races
which take place throughout first
and second term all over London,
including Richmond (Coming this
Wednesday) and Bushy Park.
Parliament Hill is the first race;
8km for guys and 4km for girls,
and containing some of the most
notorious climbs, it is often muddy,
though the new members of the club
were blissfully unaware of this.
Arriving at 2:45, there was time
for the team to have a short warm
up, apply some imaginative red &
blue face (war) paint and snap a quick
team photo before the race started
at 3:15. At this point a long-standing
tradition known as King-of-the-Hill
took place, when several runners
raced to the top of the steep climb
which makes up the first few hundred
meters of the course.
Imperial’s nominated contender,
James ‘I run 101km mountain races
for breakfast’ Ellis, surely had a
fine chance, but alas, St. Mary’s had
anticipated this threat and were quick
out of the blocks to just steal the
crown by a few metres, adding more
evidence to the case that they are in
fact running cyborgs.
The race continued on over the
scenic hills of Hampstead Heath,
with a number of Imperialites setting
out well to the support of Women’s
Captain Cloudy Carnegie, who had
been forced to sit it out. The course
was complicated by limited marking,
and there were several cases of
runners going the wrong way.
Thankfully after a couple of laps,
all made it back without adding too
much distance to their race. After
some hard-fought battles against
fellow students, mud, dogs and ‘The
Flash’, team Imperial came home
strong. Returning member Kimberly
Mason was first woman back for
Imperial, and debutants Jess Prior
and Anna Lawson brought home the
top three girls team after their lap.
They then turned their attention
to an incredible sight; fresher Chris
Olley coming home in first place!
An impressive victory considering
the many good runners from St.
Mary’s and Kings. Not far behind was
another newcomer, Mike Ridley, and
old timer Liam Smith.
Great displays were also shown by
Rupert Hepton and Johnny Bosch,
while newcomers Tom Stokes and
Chloe Mason had navigational issues
and Will Jones gallantly dropped
out of the race to help a runner from
another college who’d sprained
their ankle. All in all this was a great
performance in tough conditions and
a brilliant start to the year for team
Imperial.
A well-earned club meal in GBK
followed. Feel free to join us next
week for a far flatter run amongst the
deer in Richmond Park or one of our
many other scenic Training sessions.

Rugby 2nd XV lose close game
Imperial’s 2nd team made the
long journey to Kent to play
Christchurch Canterbury,looking
to rectify last week’s game which
by all rights should have been won.
Imperial clearly coped better
with the delayed start as they
had the upper hand in the early
exchanges,which resulted in Tom
Mavin making an inspired run
involving steps and fends going
over to score a seven pointer.
This seemed to ire up the
opposition and their large hoard
of supporters thus allowing them
to gain some front football,using
their big runners unimaginatively
yet effectively.A combination of
this and some poor defending from
Imperial allowed Christchurch into
the lead to with two tries.
Christchurch kept the pressure
on but improved defence from
Imperial limited them to a
couple of long range penalty
efforts which they were unable to
convert. Eventually Imperial,with
Tom Mavin setting the example,
switched on again and worked
their way up the ield and after
some nice back interplay Ruairi
Dunne was able to score in the
corner.
This was backed up by a nice
conversion by Anthony Cheuk to
put Imperial back in the lead just
before half time.The second half
was not quite as entertaining as
the irst,with neither side really
able to gain a foot hold.
A lack of match practice
showed for Imperial as we
spent vast amounts of the half
trying to play rugby in our own
red zone.Ultimately this cost
us as Christchurch were able to
capitalise on an Imperial mistake
and score again.
Imperial tried to ight back but
unfortunately time was against
them and the match ended in a
17-14 defeat.

The unbeaten ICURFC boys
proudly journeyed all the
way out to North London
to challenge the medics of UCL –
officially the RUMS rugby club – in
what was sure to be a crucial, possibly
title-deciding fixture.
All was faring well on the Imperial
boys’ quest to become men as Coach
Rich was seen to have found his
way to the correct ground for a
Wednesday fixture.
Confidence was high as Ed
“Paper Plane” Durkin (Captain of
Morale, season 14-15) cheered on
his housemate and on-field captain,
James Cocks, to kick over the first
three points of the game in favour of
Imperial.
The early lead was well deserved but
unfortunately short-lived as RUMS
ran in two tries in quick succession to
take a cushioned lead.
The Imperial reply was powerful
with Tom Hedley scoring close to the
posts to allow easy addition of the
following two points.
A double interchange of scores
between the two sides saw Hedley
tally again and the board begin to
look like a village cricket total.
26-22 to RUMS. The Imperial boys
spent the first 20 minutes of the
second half retaining the ball and
playing the best rugby of the game
but were held out by a gritty defense.
The forwards worked their way up
the field with powerful breaks from
Adam Postlethwaite and Joe Bowden.
Finally the ball was released to the
backs to be spread wide and Fred
Brown used his pace to evade his
opposite number and touch down in
the corner, granting the away side the
lead again.
Unfortunately a two-footed
challenge from the opposition landed
near Freddie’s, formerly untouched
and innocent, sphincter as he dived in
to score resulted in a substitution of
wingers to see young Carlos Sheppard
take the field, all the way from British
Columbia.
Ladies of Imperial you have
nothing to worry about as I’m sure
Mr. White, one of the founding
faces of RigSoc, will not be deterred
from attending ACC this coming
Wednesday.
IC’s defense appeared to become
more and more flimsy as RUMS put
in another thirteen points to take a
comfy lead.
With only minutes to go Olisa
Ufodiama (certified BNOC) brushed
off numerous tackles to charge up
centerfield and score between the
posts to narrow the margin.
Unfortunately the boys’ hopes were
crushed as RUMS relentlessly scored
another ten points and sealed their
victory late on.
The despondent Imperial lads
trudged back to South Kensington
without Sylvia to drown their sorrows
and begin preparations for the fixture
against St. Mary’s. This game is sure
to result with a victory.
Be sure to make your way through
the hot gate on Wednesday 29th
October to attend ACC and observe
the might of the disciplined and
uniform ICURFC.
