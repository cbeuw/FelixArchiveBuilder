This week at Imperial Cinema
By this point,the Imperial midterm
blues are probably starting to hit; it’s
getting colder and darker outside
and the work is piling up but never
fear we’re bringing you two hilarious
comedy sequels to cheer you up!
The Inbetweeners 2
Directors: Damon Beesley,Iain
Morris
Screenplay: Damon Beelsey,Iain
Morris
Cast: James Buckley,Simon Bird,Joe
Thomas,Blake Harrison
Inbetweeners2 sees more of the
gross-out humour that we have
grown to know and love from Will,
Simon Neil and Jay.
Picking up from the irst ilm,Will
and Simon are at University and
iguring out it’s not all it’s cracked
out to be,Neil is working and
Jay is on his gap yah in Australia.
When Jay,who has always taken
rather generous liberties with the
truth,brags to the boys about his
abundant Australian sexscapades,
guess what happens next…
Inbetweeners2is another
hysterically funny installment in the
series that also looks like it’ll be it’s
last.

22 Jump Street
Directors: Phil Lord,Christopher
Miller
Screenplay: Michael Bacall,Oren
Uziel,Rodney Rothman
Cast: Channing Tatum,Jonah Hil
21JumpStreet was the surprise
smash hit of 2012,seriously who
knew Channing Tatum had comedic
(cough cough acting) chops?!
For anyone who was living under
a rock circa 2012,Jonah Hill and
Channing Tatum play bromantic
rookie cops who are sent to
iniltrate a high school drug ring
with hilarious results.As is one of
the golden rules of Hollywood:‘if it
ain’t broke don’t ix it’so in 22Jump
Streetthe boys are back doing pretty
much the same thing but this time
at University!
What could seem like tried and
tested material feels fresh with the
help of the chemistry between Hill
and Tatum and smart,self-aware
writing about the dumbness of
sequels.
Top tip: stay behind for the credits
reel.

How to surive a horror ilm
Ellen Mathieson gives you some top tips to make it through any evil
encounters you might have this Halloween
It’s late night on Halloween, and
you and a group of friends are
walking home from your party
of choice. One of you takes a wrong
turning and somehow you suddenly
lost in a part of London you don’t
know. You stop and ask for directions,
but no-one is being helpful. And even
though there are only five of you,
for some reason you can hear a sixth
set of footsteps. Is there someone
following you?
Oops, it seems like you’ve
inadvertently walked into the scenes
of a horror film. If you’re going to
survive the night, you’d better follow
my advice.
Be the right person
First off, to survive you need to make
sure that you’re the right character.
Everyone knows that it’s the blonde
bimbo in eight-inch heels, and an
inappropriately small amount of
clothing for the time of year, that goes
first. So make sure you have a pair of
sensible shoes for running on, and
try to care more about your life than
breaking a nail.
Next up as a victim, it’s probably
either the jock or the outsider – the
alpha male is a pretty easy target for
any self-respecting murderer, for
multiple reasons. One: they probably
stand the best chance of stopping you.
Two: I don’t know, it’s just the rules.
I don’t write the rules. I don’t even
know who writes the rules. As for the
outsider, they’re just easy pickings,
right? I mean, nobody really talks
to them, they’re always off being
intellectual – no-one will notice if
someone casually sneaks up and
violently and noisily murders them.
If you’re a girl, your best bet for
survival is to be the meekly pretty
virgin with a bit of backbone that will
tell the guy chasing you that they’re
evil, or crazy, or a murderer, then run
for the hills. If you’re a guy, being the
romantic interest is probably your
best bet. Even evil, crazy murderers
are romantics at heart.
Go to the right place
Congratulations, you’ve managed to
be the right person and survive the
first couple of killings, but you’ve got
a while to go before you’re safe. You
need to find a good space to hide and
wait until morning. Unfortunately
it’s fast approaching three in the
morning and anyone in there right
mind is going to asleep, or at the very
least ignoring the crazy sounding
person banging on their door
screaming about a killer.
The first place you should probably
avoid is anywhere obviously
abandoned. Creepy old factories, or
train stations, or office blocks are
easily the sort of place that a dastardly
villain could set a trap. You don’t
want to nip to the loo in the middle of
the night only to be impaled by old,
rusty equipment.
Try not to go anywhere that is
imbued with history either. Though
you may manage to avoid the guy
chasing you for a bit, you’re bound
to bump into some nasty ghoul
that doesn’t like the fact that you’re
invading his territory, and come after
you.
I hear that hotels are quite nice
places to spend the night, why not see
if you can find one?
Things you shouldn’t do
Don’t have sex. If you do, you will
die almost immediatly, if not during.
Everyone knows that the couple who
have sex are always the next ones
to die. Why not fill your time with
useful things like trying to escape
instead?
Don’t split up. For some reason in
every horror film someone decides
that it is a great idea to split up. Don’t
be the idiot who suggests it. Splitting
up is the one of the stupidest ideas
you can have. You’re not Scooby Doo
and his friends, you don’t need to
search for clues. Just stay together.
Don’t lose your phone. Don’t put
it down. Don’t drop it and break
it. It’s one of the most important
possessions you have for getting out
of trouble. If you lose it, or lose your
phone signal, you’re probably already
dead.
Finally, don’t be an idiot. And
maybe, if you’re very lucky, you
might escape. Good luck!
Seriously, don’t be this girl Photo: Joss Whedon/Lionsgate
