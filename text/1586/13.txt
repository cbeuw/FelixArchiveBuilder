"Why did
you run
for a sabb
position?
P: The
chances of
winning
were good!"
"When
I was a
student,
I never
really knew
what the
Union was
or what
the Union
provides"
B: But are they not concerned
about the standard of education
they are getting? Is the standard of
postgrad teaching better than for
undergrads?
P: I’m not in a position to say yet,
I’ve only had this job a month and a
half. There are concerns, involving
league tables, just like with undergrad
league tables, so there is an interest in
wanting to get postgrad students to be
involved with feedback on education.
B: How do you think Nat did last
year?
P: I think she did a great job. I wasn’t
as heavily involved in the Union
before I got the role as Nat was, so I
can only really judge now how she
did. Her involvement with the year
and dep reps was outstanding.
B: It has been suggested that the
students who complete the NSS
perhaps give an unrepresentative
view because of the amount of
surveys students get sent to
complete.
P: Yeah, the Union recognises that
students may be getting over-
surveyed.
B: But is there a better way than
conducting surveys to find out the
student opinion?
P: Maybe better use of year reps?
Regular student engagement is useful.
B: Why did you run for a
sabbatical position?
P: A friend of mine recommended
to Nat that I should run for the DPE
position. I gave it some thought.
B: Why did your friend
recommend to Nat that she talk to
you?
P: I was a year rep before, and I was a
treasurer for another society before
with my friend, so I guess he thought
I did a good job!
B: What are you doing after this
year?
P: I have just finished my 3rd
year of
EEE, so I’m going back to complete
my degree. It’s going to be interesting
changing back going from a working
environment back to student life.
B: Why did you run for a sabb
position now rather than later on
in your degree?
P: The chances of winning were good!
B: What do you think about
Chris saying that the DPE and
DPW should be combined? Or do
you think you two are doing two
separate jobs, the roles worthy of
two full-time employees?
P: Yeah, I think there should be two
separate roles.
B: What do you think about him
donating a third of his salary?
P: I think it’s very admirable.
B: Is there anything you like or
dislike about the Union from a
student perspective?
P: Good question, when I was a
student, I never really knew what
the Union was or what the Union
provides. But now I realise that
the Union has some great schemes
running the representation network
and also having all the clubs and
societies. I think some students take
the Union for granted, and I think
that the Union should maybe address
this, by better communication.
B: What do you think about having
hot desk sessions?
P: No. I don’t think it’s very
approachable. Open office policy is
better; it’s more private and would be
more successful.
B: What manifesto points did you
have for this year?
P: Feedback, E-Learning, Postgrad
involvement.
B: What about the issue of
changing the deadline policy?
So students don't get zero marks
for being a minute late for the
deadline?
P: That’s a welfare point.
B: Why is it primarily welfare?
P: Because it was Chris’ manifesto
point! It’s his project, but we’re all
behind it. It brings back the issue of
DPE and DPW. The line is blurred
between them, because Imperial is an
educational institution, but student
welfare is obviously an issue.
B: Did you go out a lot in
your Freshers week? Can you
recommend any places or any
places to avoid?
P: I didn’t go out a lot. East London’s
quite exciting! I used to live in East
London, so just go out in the area and
see what’s there.
B: If you were trapped on a desert
island with the other Sabbs, who do
you think you would collectively
decide to eat first?
P: Whoever would provide the most
nutrition. Don’t know who that is!
B: Who do you think would be the
last person to survive?
P: Probably Tom, he can climb over
rocks and everything!
B: If you had to have tinder, what
bio would you have?
P: Normally, I would leave those
profiles blank. With regards to
online dating, I think it’s interesting
to provide as little information
as possible, so then when you get
chatting, you have things to talk
about, like “What do you do?” and
“Where are you from?”
B: Okay, say your tinder profile
earns you a date but because you
are so busy with all your Sabb
duties, you don't have time to
leave campus, and have to have
your first date at an Imperial
establishment. Where do you go?
P: Either the Union Bar or Eastside.
Depends which one’s quieter.
B: If you had to eat one meal from
FiveSixEight for the rest of your
life, what would it be?
P: Chicken burger with cheese and
bacon with curly fries!
B: Didn't even have to think about
that one!
