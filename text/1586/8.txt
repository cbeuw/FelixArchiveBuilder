Should non-participants be forced
to subsidise events?
Oh how trendy it is to decry
the College for their financial
decisions! Mind you, short of
stating parallels with ‘Butcher of the
Somme’, we can settle for glorifying
an ambiguous term such as ‘student
experience’ – nails in the coffin, I
tell you! But do we try to view this
topic from a rational perspective?
I’m afraid the morality fever has
permeated the campus a little too far
for that - let’s hope I’m mistaken.
A few clarifications I require with
regards to the article. What’s the
point of saying 220k budget is 0.22%
of the College’s endowment fund? Do
you think that it should be 0.23% or
maybe 0.26%? Your argument only
decries a loss of money from the fund
for social events of halls, on the basis
that otherwise, it would go to achieve
some ‘common good’, aka student
experience – and promptly say that
that 220k is ‘fully affordable’ for the
College. You put forward arguments
for the existence of the fund, not
its degree of financial resources;
justifying affordability of the fund
based on a statistic of 0.22% looking
meagre, getting the gullible to agree
with your alarmist approach. Not to
mention that endowment actually
concerns partly the investment of
the principal the College cannot use
to fund on-going expenditures, only
the interest return it brings. So one
actually needs to fiddle with the
definition of endowment to arrive at
0.22%.
Your view of budgets, that if an
activity in isolation is deemed as
affordable because it represents
some small part of the budget hence
justified, is somewhat of a ridiculous
premise. We need to consider 1)
whether given activity is in the
remit of the College, 2) the costs
and benefits of activity 3) compare
the activity to the host of other
possibilities. That’s a complex task,
but tackling step 1 will be sufficient to
absolve us of any need to proceed to
steps 2 and 3.
Do social events by halls have 100%
attendance rate? No. Whatever it
is, it implies that non-participants
are subsidising the participants –
the money ultimately comes from
students paying for halls. What
right do people attending the events,
including the hall seniors, have to
justify forcing non-participants
to subsidise these events? Student
experience? First, money’s taken off
me, then I find out it goes to pay for
some piss-up, and finally I’m told I
can attend whether I like it or not –
some experience, eh? (Before you say
I don’t have to live in halls: isn’t that
a bit rich when we have a system of
public universities, receiving proceeds
from general taxation? College is not a
private entity.)
This is the pretence of knowledge –
alleging that hall seniors know better
how to provide student experience,
rather than each individual student
deciding what events to pay for
and engage to boost their ‘student
experience’. Value is subjective,
each individual is valuing trade-offs
differently and by denying me choice
of spending my own money (that
I had to chip in for the fund in the
first place) on other events that will
improve my ‘student experience’, I
am denied the ‘student experience
surplus’. Let’s say that I decide to go
to a student event to socialise, and
hence boost my ‘student experience’,
for which I pay £x; I will pay for it
if I personally value the ‘student
experience’ I get to be above £x; that
difference is the surplus that oh,
makes me happy! A one-size fits all
approach of redistribution cannot
achieve this.
Alas, the answer is nearly provided
in your article. You say, that with
the loss to the fund, there will be
fewer events by halls. If the events
are in demand by residents of halls,
seniors can put them up, charge for
them, and see how it goes. Let them
compete with what this ‘unfriendly
city’ has to offer.
Now, I assume you could say,
because I benefit from social
cooperation of students, I am
obliged to give back to boost their
student experience. Sorry, but social
cooperation is a result of human
action, not a perquisite – no subset
of the student body provides it for
my enjoyment which would justify
charging me for utilising it and
neither do I. It is a spontaneous result

with no ownership; one can withdraw
to their own detriment. But what
about students who benefit less from
that social cooperation? It’s their
choice how much they act to benefit
from it – we have an equal right to
social cooperation, but no right to
equal outcomes from it.
Now what do I think of the
College’s action? We pay them fees
and in return we expect education
in an environment conducive to it.
They should strive to provide, this
but that doesn’t justify engaging in
redistribution of ‘student experience’.
Scrap the fund and lower the fees for
halls. Don’t give into wailing about
student experience – otherwise, you
support their conclusions that you
know better how to provide ‘student
experience’ then students themselves.
And I am holding the College to this
standard because at the end of the
day, they are a public university –
don’t let me keep this small argument
that would favour the idea of
privatising Imperial.
George Butcher’s response...
It’s nice to get a response from a
comment article–it means at least
one person read it.
Sadly I don’t see the parallels
between the‘Butcher of the
Somme’(presumably referencing
Field Marshal Douglas Haig who
lead British soldiers to 2 million
casualties in the irst world war)
and the halls amenities fund,but
that may just be me.
Halls are more than just
accommodation,they are about
building a community.I know I
wouldn’t have met many of my
good friends without the strong
community that the hall seniors and
wardens built up around my halls;
friends at other universities don’t
know anyone outside their corridor–
don’t underestimate how important
organised social events are in your
irst year.
We expect more than just a
lecture course from College,that’s
why it also funds our student union,
employs counsellors,has a doctor’s
surgery and yes,provides irst years
with accommodation.It’s a dificult
balance from College to make,but I
believe it has failed to recognise the
signiicance of the amenities fund
to many students.
