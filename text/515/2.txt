Sir, - W c feel that it was very
undemocratic of you to close
correspondence about abortion
rights. Surely as a n officer of a,
democratic union, i n charge ofl
the means by which the members j
of the union correspond their
feelings you have superseded your
a u t h o r i t y as p r e p a r e r of
publications with dictatorship.
Y o u were democratically elected
not to censor but to set.
W e feel that the last letter you
passed for publication, from Miss
Earnshaw. was contraversial and
open to extreme criticism. T o
deny us the right to do this in
F E L I X implies your support for
its content (which may be the
case), a n d indicates the misuse of
F E L I X for private purpose.
Whatever reasons you may
have h a d for this, it cannot
possibly have been due to lack of
space for an exhausted argument.
A s long as individuals wish to
comment they must not be denied
the means by which to do so. As
for lack of space, this certainly
cannot be, as you have found
room for publication of letters
between J a n Czernuszka and the
editor of the M o r n i n g Cloud
which are of the nature of a
personal vendetta between the
two and which we are sure invoke
nothing like the interest which the
case of abortion rights does
among readers.
W e therefore ask you to reverse
your decision, and in future not to
intervene in a discussion in such
an autocratic manner.

Dear Sir, - Oops! Rereading m v
last letter ( F E L I X 514) I see how
offensive some parts seem to be. I
must have been in a funny mood
when I wrote it. Apologies all
round.
But I want mainly to discuss
here the far more worrying
aspects contained in a letter from
a M a t h s P G Thingy about being
called Miss. T h e kind of raving
man! - h a t i n g c l e a r i n that
paragraph is most disturbing and
does no credit to the writer or the
movement it (I assume thingies,
are genderless) tries to further "A
itoman needs a man like a fish needs a
bicycle" quotes thingy in self-
asserting smugness. I can at least
understand what feminists are
trying to achieve, but why oh why
the ever-present almost rabid
man-hating? T h e point, thingy, is
that although a woman does need
a man, what is equally important
is that a man needs a woman. T h e
sooner thingies a n d C o . realise
this the better it will be for us all.
Yours, etc etc

P.S. Notice how, with great sell-
control. I avoided saying ' M i s s
Thingy'.
Dear Sir, - Congratualtions to
everyone for their support for the
refectory boycott last term. I had
not realised that feeling was so
strong in the College and would
like to apologise for the time I
wasted at the last U n i o n meeting
opposing the total boycott in the
belief there would not he
sufficient support for it to work.

Dire C u r . - In reply to M r Rastus
A d o l f Napolean O d i n g a Odinga's
letter ofthe 23rd M a r c h ( F E L I X
514). may I just say that I have
been censored by three successive
F E L I X editors, and censured by
M i c k M a g h a r during my three
years at iC?
Yours faithfully.
K e n (Random) Fenning.
Dear Sir. - Has the College finally
taken over F E L I X ? Has the
Editor sold his soul for several
Megapennies? Does the Rector
c e n s o r F E L I X ? A l l these
questions and more flashed
through my mind on reading your
recent front page headline:-
F E L I X - T H E N E W S P A P E R
O F I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E . I
trust, however, that it was
merely a rare composing error &
we will see a speedy return to
F E L I X - the Newspaper of
Imperial College U n i o n and leave
Topic as the Newspaper of
Imperial College.

O n Wednesday, 2nd M a y next we hope to entertain some 300
personally invited visitors to the College from about 4.30 p.m. until 7.30
p.m. T h e visitors will be drawn entirely from the local community and
our object is to let them see something of the College i n action, how
many a n d varied are the occupations and activities in which we are
involved and to learn something more, at first hand, about what we are
trying to achieve in Imperial College. As a result, we hope to enhance
the goodwill of our nearest neighbours for the College, its staff and
students.
The programme is being arranged by a working committee drawn
from departments and administration under the Chairmanship of the
Domestic Secretary and includes a considerable number of both static
and working model displays, pictorial and photographic displays, the
"Transformation Scene" recently mounted by M r s . Pingree, the
College Archivist, certain laboratories with their associated displays, as
well as many I.C. U n i o n Societies' exhibits.
O u r visitors will arrive between 4.30 p.m. a n d 5.00 p.m., have tea,
and after an opening address, copiously illustrated, by the Rector in the
Great H a l l , be free to view the exhibits which will be mounted i n the
A n t e - R o o m and the Junion C o m m o n R o o m of Sherfield Building and
visit the laboratories arranged in the Electrical and C i v i l Engineering
Departments; guides will be provided. T h e visit will be rounded off
with an informal glass-of wine in the Senior C o m m o n R o o m of Sherfield
Building taken with some members of staff and students and those
involved in the mounting of the exhibits and displays.
