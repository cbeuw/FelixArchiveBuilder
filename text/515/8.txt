IC at NUS Conference!
As Piers C o r b y n said: IC always gets there whether they are
in or out.
Anyhow, out or i n , we were represented at what was
probably the most boring, a n d possibly the most important
conference for m a n y years
As usual, the Broad Left Junta was re-elected, Junta i n this
case being T r e v o r Phillips, Dave Aaronovitch, A l a n Christie
with various others being reshuffled notably Helen Connor
becoming Treasurer and the Incredible H u l k Fiona M c T a g g a r t
switching f r o m V.P. Welfare to V.P. Services. The major upset
of the elections occurred when M i k e G o o d m a n (Pres Brunei)
defeated John M e r r y (B.L.: not British Leyiand though one
wonders at times) for V.P. Education.
Conference opened with T. Phillips condemning the 13% rise as too
little and describing the lack of coordination in the D.E.S.
The serious content of conference consisted of debate on
Constitutional changes, the Exec report and a short period towards the
end for emergency motions.
In the Constitution debates proposals were presented by the
Constitutional Review Body ( C R B ) with numerous amendments from
the Constituent Organisations, many of which were not debated, much
to the dissatisfaction of many present. T h e most contentious subjects
were structure and Elections, Part time Student Membership, Finance
and Subscriptions and Women.
The Structure of N U S will continue to be confederal ie. a 3-tier
system of N U S , C O s and students, rather than a National U n i o n of
individuals as proposed by the Tories who were also in favour of
nationwide elections for N U S posts.
Part time students will be represented in a 10:1 ratio to full time
students as part of a phased introduction. Postgraduates will be
considered as a separate group and will have their own conference.
W o m e n will have two conferences, one open / one closed as opposed to
the present single open conference. This was also opposed by the Tories
(They had a monopoly on Amendment 1 to most motions).
The major defeat on the constitution was the new finance a n d
subscriptions M o t i o n which proposed to increase the polytcch. sub and
not surprisingly was opposed by them.
The Emergency Motions on the last day had little time and only two,
Grants and Cuts and Overseas Students, of the four prioritized were
debated and were predictable although very necessary.
Conference finished with an hour of self-indulgence and all dispersed
tired.
Overall it was personally a worthwhile although exhausting
experience and would gladly be repeated. A h ! , I forgot the Liberals but
never m i n d .

Parliamentary Candidates
and G a y Rights
Last s u m m e r when everyone thought there would be a
general election i n October, I wrote to the Party leaders and
various prospective Parliamentary Candidates to discover
their opinions on G a y Rights.
M y letter asked about their attitudes to the following:
(1) The legal age ol consent should be the same for homosexuals as
for heterosexuals (i.e. 16). M a l e homosexual relationships are
completely illegal in Scotland a n d Northern Ireland a n d illegal in
England and Wales for all people aged under 21. Since everyone can
vote at 18 and get married under 18. it is outrageous that the law does
not consider men and women aged 20 sufficiently mature to determine
their own relationships without its intervention.
(2) W o m e n and men should have the right to freedom from a l l
discrimination (e.g. in employment, accomodation) resulting from
either being gay, openly gay (e.g. wearing badges at or outside work), or
actively gay (e.g. participating in demonstrations or joining political,
social or eouneelling gay organisations).
(3) Lesbianism should not be used as justification either for
presenting custody of children being granted to their mother or for
refusing A.I.I). (Artificial Insemination by Donor) to lesbians,
(4) " P r i v a c y " , "Indecency", and " S o l i c i t i n g " should be defined so
that homosexual conduct would not be prosecuted where comparable
heterosexual acts would not be an olfenee.
(5) Literature and advertising directed to homosexual women and
n u n should not be prosecuted where similar material directed to
heterosexual men and women would not be liable to prosecution.
(()) There should be an end to the harassment of gays by police (e.g."
recent raids on gay clubs a n d pubs particularly in L o n d o n a n d
Manchester; such raids rarely result in prosecution but merely threats
of prosecution which have caused several clubs to close).
(7) The ban on G a y News, the fortnightly gay newspaper, by W . H .
Smith should end. In many parts ofthe country W . H . Smiths were the
sole distributor of Gay News which is a lifeline for many isolated gay
men and women.
(8) T h e .conviction against G a y News in the 'Blasphemy Trial',
initiated by M a r y Whitehouse, which resulted in fines totallingÂ£1500,
should be quashed when it is reconsidered in the House of Lords in the
near future.
The replies received were as follows:
P A R T Y L E A D E R S
J i m Callaghan, Labour Party opted out and did not reply but sent
the letter to various Government Departments including the H o m e
Office, Northern Ireland and Scottish Office, and the Department of
Health a n d Social Security. T h e H o m e Office said that the law of
blasphemy would be looked at by the L a w Commission during a review
of offences against religion and public worship. O n other issues of law,
the Policy Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences was supposed to be
looking at possible areas of change although at that time (24 August),
the Government had no plans to change the law.
The Northern Ireland Office and Scottish Office both said that
attempts were being made to bring their laws on the matter into line
with England a n d Wales. T h e Scottish Office said that although
homosexual acts between consenting males were illegal i n Scotland
there had not been any prosecutions.
Maggie Thatcher, Conservative Party. Gave a short reply that she
was not interested in extending the law on any of the subjects
mentioned.
David Steel, Liberal Party, said that his general stance was that
there, should be no discrimination against homosexuals, a n d he
enclosed a resolution from the Liberal Party Council supporting a
Homosexual L a w Reform Bill promoted by the C a m p a i g n for
Homosexual Equality (C.H.E.).
L O C A L C O N S T I T U E N C I E S
City of London and Westminster South
Conservative Party Candidate - Peter Brooke supports gay rights
although he felt some of the points in my letter were not matters for
legislation.
Labour Party Candidate - Russell Proffit. Supports gay rights and
thinks there should be a law against discrimination because of sexual
orientation. H e sees the issue as related to the way rights are denied to
others, such as Blacks.
Liberal Party Candidate - Harry Ball Wilson. Supports most of the
changes suggested in m y letter a n d that it should be unlawful to
discriminate in matters such as housing and employment on grounds of
sexual orientation.
Kensington Constituency
Liberal - no reply
L a b o u r - A n n Holmes said she was very firmly committed to the light
for homosexual equality and said that there should not be a definition of
heterosexuality as 'normal' and homosexuality behaviour as
'abnormal'. As a comment about police behaviour she supported
greater accountability of the police force.
Chelsea Constituency
L a b o u r - no reply
Liberal - Peter Driver agreed with gay rights and called for greater
police understanding of minority rights.
Conservative - Nicholas Scott sent an acknowledgement only (but
C . H . E . inform me that he is a supporter of gay rights).
I hope that these attitudes on gay rights will aid you in your decision
on how to vote in the General Election.

President I.C.U.
