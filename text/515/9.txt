Vote Labour on May 3
For those who have managed to avoid all papers, television and
radio over the last lew weeks, you will be amazed to hear that next
Thursday, 3 May Is General Election day.
Socialists argue lor the election of a Labour Government - not
necessarily because of the record ol the right wing Labour politicians in
the past but because of the need to build a socialist future for Britain
which can be achieved through a left Labour government bringing
about fundamental changes to our society. The MP's elected under the
name of the Labour Party often do not reflect the policies of the Party as
decided by conference but this can be changed through the
establishment of greater democracy and accountability.
What changes are needed in Britain today? We need more spending
on social services, on community projects, on the health service and on
education. This will open up facilities for the population and increase
the social standard of living. Economic changes are needed which will
revitalise the economy and end the scandal of the 1 V 2 million
unemployed.
Through taking major companies into social ownership there can be
investment, expansion and planning of production such that the basic
necessities of life are provided for all the population. New technolgical
advances can be used to help increase living standards instead of being
used by employers as an excuse to throw people out of work.
All these things may seem a

the AGM on Tuesday 1 st May, Stans Bar at 8.30pm at which voti ng for all

Last but not least is a mammoth trip to France, canoeing in the
Pyrenees or Alps, for two weeks (9-22 July). Would anyone who wants

long way off achieving but there
a r e a n u m b e r of L a b o u r
candidates worth supporting who
would do their best if elected to
Parliament. For those who live in
Hall you are in the Constituency
of C i t y o f L o n d o n a n d
Westminster South and your
Labour candidate is Russell
Profitt who is fighting a 7,000 Tory
majority. H e is p a r t i c u l a r l y
interested in Educational issues.
He was originally from Guyana
and educated at Goldsmiths
College and is involved in the anti-
racist fight.
The candidate for Kensington is
Ann Holmes. The Tory majority
there is only just over 1,000 and
she has a good chance of winning.
The Conservative ex M P Sir
Brandon Rhys Williams, who is
the Tory candidate has also been
selected as a candidate for the
South East London Constituency
for the European Assembly. This
constituency at the far end of
London is regarded as a safe Tory
seat. It seems highly unlikely that
Sir Brandon can do justice to both
jobs.
A n n Holmes is a research
worker and a mother of 2 and has
been active in many local
c a m p a i g n s i n c l u d i n g t h e
campaign for a North Kensing-
ton nursery and against racism.

Anyone interested in canvassing
should meet at the Kensington
offices, 92 Ladbroke Grove, W11
(229 6259) any evening after 6pm.
People are also needed to leaflet
during the day and also to help on
polling day.
If y o u live in Croydon or in the
area y o u may be interested in
supporting the candidate in
Central Croydon David White who
is a strong socialist fighting a tiny
164 C o n s e r v a t i v e majority,
(phone Frank Leppington, 4278,
for details).
Where ever you are, vote for Left
candidates in the General election
and stop the possibility of one of
the most reactionary Conserv-
ative governments for many
years.
