RECTOR'S CONTRA-
DICTION ON OVERSEAS
STUDENTS
T h e Rector has indicated that
he will not oppose a quota on the
numlier pf overseas students al I C
imposed by the University Grants
Committee. But he still maintains
the right of the College to select
students regardless of origin.
In a letter to L o r d A n n a n , V i c e
Chancellor of L o n d o n If niversity,
he says that the proportion of
overseas students has been falling
slightly over the last few years and
therefore the College would have
no difficulty in meeting the target
of 7 per cent fewer overseas
students in 1981/82 compared to
1975/76.
In another letter to N U S
President Trevor Phillips he
expresses the view that a quota
system may be "Me best means of
preserving access for poorer students
jrom underdeveloped countries",
rather than high lees w hich favour
rich students.
But in the following paragraph
he states that "lie have a
fundamental right, as a I nirersily
institution, to select our own sludenls
whatever their origin". H e makes no
attempt to explain how he
reconciles the two views.
S E X D I S C R I M I N A T I O N
REJECTED
Captain Lindley, Domestic
Secretary, should have known
better than to ask IC U n i o n to
provide lour women student
receptionists for the College's
' M e e t - I C " day next Wednesday.
M a r y Altcnborough's ready
response was that the U n i o n
w o u l d be w i l l i n g to f i n d
receptionists but would refuse to
provide students of a particular
sex.
Captain Lindley's argument
that women were prettier and
more charming failed to persuade
M a r y who remained adamant,
and he has been forced to recruit
his receptionists without U n i o n
assistance.
A further request for 20 Guides
of any sex for " M e e t - I C " will be
complied with.
AP READY

A l t e r n a t i v e P r o s p e c t u s has

ORDINARY RESIDENCE
GOVERNMENT REPLIES
T h e Department of Education
and Science has finally replied to
a letter sent by IC U n i o n three
months ago about the inter-
p r e t a t i o n of the o r d i n a r y
residence requirement lor the
award of student grants.
A change in interpretation
resulting from a D E S circular to
local authorities last year has
deprived six IC students of grants
they had expected to be awarded.
But the D E S say that "there has
not been a change in policy or
regulations concerning the 3 year
ordinary residence requirement", in his
paper.
IC U n i o n is not satisfied by the
D E S reply and intends to
challenge the new interpretation
in the courts.
