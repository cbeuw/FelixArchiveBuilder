contemporary society does
not lie in pandering to our
s o c i a l c o n s c i e n c e s . F o r
although all of us, during our
three years at Imperial
College, will become aware to
v a r y i n g e x t e n t s o f the
i n j u s t i c e s , f a i l i n g s a n d

prevail in m o d e r n life, it is
not enough for us simply to
keep our hands clean. It is not
enough for us simply to spend
money on social services,
education, â€¢quHabta! admin-
i s t r a t i o n and the welfare
state. That wealth must first
be created: and this is the real
challenge. M o n e y must be
earned before it can justly be
d i s t r i b u t e d . It is t h e
challenge of industry: for
those engaged in industry at
whatever level, are those who
are creating our society's
wealth.
In answer to this very real need,
an Industrial Society is being,
formed at Imperial College. It
will offer speaker meetings and
presentations from all levels and
types of management and trade
unionism. In addition, there will
be visits to factories and other
i n d u s t r i a l a n d c o m m e r c i a l
premises, which will include not
only a tour around the works, but
also discussion with managers and
shop stewards.
It is hoped that this society
will give you an invaluable
insight into the workings of
industry and an understanding
which is important whether or not
you intend to take up an
u n d e r s t a n d i n g w h i c h is
improtant whether or not you
intend to take up an industrial or
business career. Most of us will, in
fact enter industry when we
graduate; and if we are to be
useful and successful in the jobs
we do, we must choose our job.
That choice depends on our
understanding of industry before
we take the piunge.
Industry is
people
If you find yourself sharing the
objectives and challenges of the
Industrial Society, you are invited
to the inaugural meeting, for the
election of chairman and other
members of the committee. This
will take place in the I C W A
lounge on Thursday 3rd M a y at
6pm.

Tuesday the 20th of M a r c h should always be remembered for a
dramatic developement in the growth of S C A B s youngest child
D E B S O C .
The society came of age when Miss Barbara Smoker, President of the
National Secular Society arrived at College for the debate 'This house
believes twentieth century m a n needs relgion'.
Debsoc have sought outside speakers ever since they reformed abottt
year ago. Their list of refusals is both impressivef depressing )but they
soldiered on regardless: tried kidnapping, grave-robbing, bribary,
blackmail and writing begging letters. A l l to no avail, until at last, from
out of the world of religious scepticism came a reply like a voice of one
crying in the wilderness. The cry was heard and so it was arranged for a
battle of words and wits to take place in Huxley Building.
The most available of the religious, the Rev D. Ashforth (College
Chaplain) was heralded at short notice and the stage was set for history
to be made.

M A R A N A T H A
The way the, the truth and the LIFE...
Existing is ...
R e a r e d on good morals ,
and a fair share of quarrels
I guess you had
a predictable start.
but these teachings in your m i n d
to be honest, fair and kind
bear little relations
to what is i n y o u r heart.
Desperately you appeal
to humanist ideals
but find yourself attacking
what others defend.
this confusion may unravel
through y o u r hitch-hike travels
but inevitably
therel a knot in the end.
Its easy to lean
on y o u r income dream
that in reality cannot be bought,
and experience found
by sleeping around
is the
irretrievable: sort.
So you disappear
into f'ulltime career
only to ulcerate away
as a brief case
when all else forbids
turn to doting on your kids
but they have to leave
to take up the race...
....what is existing without Life?
Existing without k n o w i n g what for
is like rowing with only one oar:
plenty of power
but little direction.
