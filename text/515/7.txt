The Death of S O L O M O N M A H L A N G U
In June 1976, while be 1
s c h o o l s t u d e n t , S o l o m o n
M a h l a n g u witnessed at first
h a n d 'brutal suppression' of
student protests i n U s h o m e
township o f M a m e l o d i . These
protests lead to the death of
over a thousand of the
d e m o n s t r a t o r s a n d p e r -
suaded M a h l a n g u to leave
South A f r i c a and train as a
freedom fighter with the
African National Congress
(ANC).
He and two companions
returned lo SA in June 1977 and
were intercepted by police in
Johannesburg and a running
battle ensued. Mahlangu and
another escaped but the third.
Mondy Motloung. was cornered
in a warehouse where he killed
two whites before being captured.
Mahlangu was detained later
when trying to find out what
happened to Motloung. As a
result of injuries sustained after
his arrest, primarily a fractured
skull. Motloung was declared
insane as a result of brain damage
and was unable to stand trial.
Thus Mahlangu. a youth of 21.
was left to stand trial alone. For
his part in these events he was
sentenced to death, even though
he h a d n t p e r s o n a l l y b e e n
involved in any killing (though no
doubt he was prepared to be).
This sentence was carried out on
the 30 M a r c h this year.
I first became aware of this
scenario when I was dragged
along to the South African
embassy by a certain M s Att... (to
hold the other end of the I C U
banner) on the Wednesday before
the execution was scheduled, and
I subsequently attended an all
night vigil at the same embassy
the f o l l o w i n g night F r i d a y
morning. The purpose of this
protest was to try and persuade
the S A government to abandon
this execution, which we failed. I
also expect that this protest has
ahead) been forgotten by most
people bar the demonstrators and
the 50 plus policemen women
who kept us company but I can-
hope that my illiterate ramblings
might remind some of you.
One disturbing point about this
protest was that while we were
supposed to be appealing against
the execution of one person, the
A N C faction was leading us in
chants along the lines;
W h o do we want? ... Vorster
H o w do we want him?...
dead!!!
O n the other hand however, at
5am, the time of the execution,
after the traditional moment of
silence, we were treated to a talk
by some official of the A N C who
after giving us the usual state of
war and just struggle bit went on
to promise that any South African
soldiers captured by A N C forces
would be treated as P O W s in
accordance with the Geneva
Gonventions (International R e d
Cross, 1949). H e then challenged
the S A government to treat A N C
prisoners the same.
T h i s i s w h e r e the v a l u e
j u d g e m e n t c r e e p s i n !
The question that has to be
answered here is: At what point (if
any) does terrorism evolve into a
just struggle against oppression?
and the complementary question:
What circumstances, (if any)
w a r r a n t the e x e c u t i o n ,of
individuals (citizens or otherwise)
by a government?
Even if I had any well formed
ideas about the answers to these
questions I would probably
refrain from airing them here but
I can leave them for you to think
about as they are both relevent in
this country at the moment. The
first governs our treatment of the
I R A and similar organisations,
eg. S h o u l d the p r o t e s t i n g
prisoners in H-Block be given
P O W status? the second is highly
r e l e v e n t w i t h the c u r r e n t
resurgence of the campaign to
reintroduce the death penalty
into British law.
Just as a foot-note, probably
totally irrelevant to the rest of this
discourse, is that a group of
mourners at the graveside of
M a h l a n g u were dispersed by
security forces with tear-gas, not
because they were posing any
threat to those police but this
was simply the easiest way of
breaking up an illegal gathering,
and act hardly endearing one to
the forces of order in South Africa.
