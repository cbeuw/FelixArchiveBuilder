IAN HUNTER - Youre Never Alone With
a Schizophrenic. (Chrysalis)
Move over! Totfre standing in my light.
T h i s apparently is Ian H u n t e r talking to himself,
w h i c h is his way of explaining the albums title -
wouldnt Y o u f e Never A l o n e W h e n Y o u r e a
Schizophrenic' be nearer the truth?
T h i s is Hunters fourth a l b u m , the first for
Chrysalis, a n d except for the excellent A l l
A m e r i c a n A l i e n B o y ' he has not really lived up to
the promise of his M o t t t the H o o p l e days.
T r u e , there are some very good tracks on this
record, but there are also some pretty pointless
ones. Life after D e a t h * is a good example; ' i s there
life, is there life after death?.. , H u n t e r moans as if
he had something new to tell us - he doesrft.
However, consider the good points, w h i c h
include his use of Bruce Springsteen^ r h y t h m
section, excellent joint production with M i c k
Ronson a n d about four potential hit singles.
Side one, track one is f
Just another N i g h t * ,
traditional E Street rock and probably the best cut.
T w o fast numbers follow, the latter of w h i c h ,
C l e v e l a n d Rocks n
, is far stronger than the
p r o t o t y p e , ' E n g l a n d Rocks', w h i c h was used on the
last tour. f
S h i p s is a hymn-like account of Hunters
relationship with his father and very touching it is
too, but not quite as good as * W h e n Daylight
C o m e s * the new single, w h i c h closes one w i t h a
short of light, quasi-reggae love song.
O n the whole it is side one w h i c h carries the
a l b u m with only two of the four longer tracks on
side two (the other H u n t e r w h i c h explains the
albums title) c a r r y i n g their weight, these being
'Standing in the L i g h t ' a n d ^Bastard7
, the latter a n
exciting song of hostility.
Yes, H u n t e r c a n write infectious pop, neat hooks
and solid rock backings; a good a l b u m , not a great
one, but still well w o r t h a listen. It is even I C
Radios A l b u m of the week, so it cant be b a d !

JEAN JACQUES BURNEL - Euroman
Cometh. (UA).
I a m a Stranglers fan, let me state that right from
the outset. In fact I have been k n o w n to play
*Rattus N o r v e g i c u s ' continually to. myself, but I
shall endeavour to direct my comments in an
unbiased manner.
J e a n Jacques Burnel is, ofcourse, the
Stranglers'French bassist and, possibly tired of
their recent work, he has branched out into
modern E u r o p e a n electronic pop. T h e result is a
promising a l b u m with good intentions w h i c h on
the whole doesnt come u p w i t h the goods.
A p p a r e n t l y E u r o m a n C o m e t h is the result of J J ,
homeless and sleepless, staying i n the studio for
days on end, gradually a d d i n g to each work. T h e
cover, w h i c h shows o u r m a n standing beneath the
multi-coloured pipes and poles of the P o m p i d o u
Centre, sets the industrial tone and this is
continued on the record.
It opens w i t h ' E u r o m a n ' in w h i c h Burnel tells us
(in French) that he is descended from
Charlemagne, C r o m w e l l , N a p o l e o n a n d H i t l e r - so
its going to be one of those you think, but 'jellyfish'
redeems the situation with its continuous d r u m -
machine beat. In fact it w o u l d not be a bad single.
T h e track ^Freddie L a k e r (Concorde and
Eurobus), comes next and I can't help liking its
boppy r h y t h m , despite the fact that the vocals are
almost unintelligible, w h i c h is a pity as it is
supposed to be quite complimentary. ' E u r o m e s s 1
has a superb lead in with bass and a beating heart-
pulse intertwined. T h e D a m n e d ! Brian James
figures prominently on r h y t h m guitar, as on many
other tracks, and L e w Lewis adds some pretty good
h a r m o n i c a work. D o n t rely o n lies', sings B u r n e l ; it
is a l l rather good.
T h e second side is definately stronger, opening
with ' D o the E u r o p e a n ' , J e a n Jacques'attempt at
Eurodisco, w h i c h is quickly forgotten when
^Triumph (Of the C o o d City)* the best track on the
a l b u m , comes around. This instrumental,
featuring motorbike engine noises, has been
produced using a semi-dub technique w h i c h keeps
the sound flowing as instruments come a n d go in
short snatches. C a r e has been taken a n d it shows;
Burnel achieves what he set out to accomplish but
only on this track.
*Pretty F o o l * a snatch of R ' n ' B , w h i c h sounds not
unlike the Stranglers, is not in the general tone of
the a l b u m but adds to its quality w i t h James
w o r k i n g hard.
T h e other three tracks on the side, one of w h i c h ,
fcrabs', is particularly annoying, are not worth
m u c h so that is it really. If the care lavished on
^ T r i u m p h * had been spread around a bit and if
Burnel d i d not insist on singing in F r e n c h , G e r m a n
or extremely distorted English, this w o u l d be an
excellent a l b u m . But it wasn't and he d i d . Better
luck next time, J e a n .

TABLE TENNIS
The T.T. club Annual General Meeting last
term elected the following officers for next
year:
Semi-immortal (President) P Rutherford
(Maths I),
Neckwear Advisor (Secretary) A Tye (Civ Eng
D.
T h e T r o u b l e m a k e r ( T r e a s u r e r ) F
Sobhanpanah (CCDI),
G o d of Humour (Publicity officer) Me.
The results of matches that took place over
Easter follow:-
IC II v Fulham IV (away) 1 - 8
IC II v St Johns (away) 7 - 2
IC I v Various Teams - no results.
Sorry about the lack of results and info, but
time was short (relativistically speaking) and
certain team captains (come in number one)
have not left any results in the letter-racks.
And finally, what you have all been waiting
for... the team averages.
1st Team:
K Lakhani .... 71%
G Hong .... 67%
K Singarajah .... 50%
2nd Team:
A Tye .... 83%
F Sobhanpanah ... 71%
R Martin .... 56%
3rd Team
J Stean .... 71%
I iReed .... 47%
P HewKIn .... 4 1 %
4th Team
P Rutherford .... 89%
M Lambert.... 5 1 %
S Cobrin .... 37%
The final team positions have not been
received yet, but a good guess, would be:-
1st team : 3rd, division 4
2nd team : 2nd division's (certain)
3rd team : 6th division 6b
4th team : 5th division 6b
Probably no more ireports this term from
J the No-longer super or incredible HEWK.
SSS Easter Elk SS,S
Well I see you all decided to
forsake M u m and Dad and come
back to IC despite the fact you'll
have to do exams this term, and
can only therefore go out drinking
six nights a week instead of seven.
Just when I was getting used to
being able to sit in my office and
play with myself without being
disturbed, hordes of students
once again descend on me. Ah,
well that's life I guess! Right now
onto the good times.
Elections
You thought your chance to
become an ICU superstar had
passed hadn't you? You thought
that next year you were doomed
to be an ordinary student with
absolutely no power and no ability
to attract hordes of people who
would desire your body and hang
on every word. Well you were
wrong - trot along to the Union
Lower Lounge and you will see
papers up for FELIX the Business
Manager, Permanent Working
Party (includes a place on
council) - 6 vacancies, External
Affairs Committee - 6 vacancies,
ICU Publicity Officer, House
Committee (3 vacancies) and
Union Finance Committee (2
vacancies). Not only this but we
also have a vacancy for External
Affairs Officer for the rest of this
year due to Sheyne Lucock's
[resignation. So all you power
(grabbing fiends out there who
see membership of the House
Committee as a way to a full and
successful sex life - now is your
chance.
Parking
There is a proposal afoot to
make one of the summer months
permit only parking and have the
two other months a free for all,
instead of m a k i n g t h e usual free
for all for all summer months. I'd
be grateful if anybody affected by
this would let me have some
feedback on this, ie if you are
staying in College over the
summer and you intend to use
your car but have no permit, but
let me k n o w by T u e s d a y
lunchtime. I'd also be grateful if
you're an undergrad. with a permit
and intend using it over the
summer.
Meet IC
Stewards are wanted to show all
the local residents around during
Meet I C . It is on Wed May 2nd
from 4.30 - 7.30 and in the last
hour you can have a few drinks on
college and chat to the locals.
A n y b o d y interested c o n t a c t
Annie in the Union Office.
Well I really can't write anymore
- all that bondage and flagellation
with leather whips in the Union
Office with the Executive over
Easter really took it out of me.
Cheers then, see you in the bar.
Mike Elkin
ICU Hon Sec.
