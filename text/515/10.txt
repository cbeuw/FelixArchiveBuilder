BOAT CLUB
Down by the river bank
Following the long winter
of h a r d training, the Boat
Club withdrew f r o m its shell
and decided to test the
standard of competition.
After a moderately successful
Reading Head, the First VIII went
on to win the Championship
E i g h t s at T h e S o u t h e r n
Universities Regatta, comfortably
defeating Cambridge University
Lightweights and establishing a
new record of six successive wins.
The Second VIII, magna-
minously, wer"e eliminated in the
first round thus enabling the
Ladies to show their skill with the
u s e of t h e m e n s ' b o a t .
Unfortunately they were unableto
fulfill expectations, due to their
success in the Womens Rowing
Council Head the previous day
where they were placed 8th, and
were disqualified whilst leading
Oxford University. The Ladies B
team nearly reached the second
round but were beaten by
Reading University First VIII, who
made a very late appearance at
the Regatta. The Mens Novices
comfortably won their first race
but came up against harder
opposition in the second race and
were eleiminated.
The major event of the term, the
Tideway Head of the River saw
disastrous conditions with 15
crews sinking, but typically the IC
teams came through unscathed.
The First and Second VII Is
finished 16th and 31st respect-
ively out of over 400 crews with
the Mens Novices positioned
237th.
Several members took part in
the Scullers Head on the 7th April,
the most successful being Chris
Howell positioned 49th out of 500.
Over the Easter Holiday several
crews took part in events in
Bedford, Evesham and Lea. At the
Bedford Head, Chris repeated his
good performance winning the
Novice Scullers Pennant by a
wide margin. The Senior A IV
selected finally on that day,
surprised everyone, not least
themselves, by winning their
division. The Elite and Senior C
coxed IVs both came 3rd in their
respective sections.
On Easter Monday at Evesham
Regatta both the Elite and Senior
A IVs won their events making
good use of the new'carbo'lVs.
The final regatta of the holidays
was at Lea where the Senior A IV
in their attempt to win the Elite B
event were beaten in the semi-
final by the eventual winners. The
Ladies, somewhat unfit after four
weeks of comfort and inactivity,
won their first race without undue
effort and reached the final after a
close fought race against the
University of London Ladies.
Unfitness told in the final which
was won by Thames. Chris again
was the winner of the day in the
Senior C sculls.
Thus the Boat C l u b has been
very a c t i v e w i t h a l s o the
lightweight IV training extensively
over the Easter Holidays with a
view to qualifying for international
representation. These events
bode well for the summer season
where, with hard training, further
s u c c e s s e s s h o u l d be forth-
coming.
