Boycott Off
The continuous refectory boycott scheduled for the start of
this t e r m is off following management's withdrawal of a 2.5
per cent price rise.
After last term's one day boycott, discussions between the
Union and Domestic Secretary Captain Lindley resulted in the
stopping of increases of 1 per cent for M a y and June to cover
increased wage costs. A 1 per cent rise for A p r i l was put on but
later halved.
Price rises to compensate for food price inflation will still go ahead
each month and a 4 per cent price rise put on in M a r c h will remain.
A full discussion ofthe wages regulator will take place at Refectory
Committee on 3rd M a y and the U n i o n will argue for smaller increases
than College has proposed.
As a result the U n i o n Executive called off the boycott from M o n d a y
and yesterday's U n i o n meeting accepted their decision without
opposition. The meeting agreed with M a r y Attenborough that it was
now more important to concentrate on improving quality. There will
be discussions about the installation of a cook freeze system.
The U n i o n will also go ahead with participation in the College's
Meet-IC day. Cooperation had been threatened as part ofthe Union's
action on refectory prices.
The meeting also passed a motion proposed by M a r y Attenborough
that the U n i o n should look into the possibility of providing its own
cheap snack bar. This suggestion arose out ofthe students experience in
providing alternative food during last term's boycotts.

B E E R - U P
Beer prices are up by 2p ajiint
this term following a price rise by
the brewers. M a r y Attenborough
is investigating whether the rise is
fully justified. The Bar accounts
for last J a n u a r y show a surplus of
£14,500 for the previous six
months representing 12.3 percent
of turnover.
M A R Y IN S W E D E N
A l t e r y e s t e r d a y ' s U n i o n
m e e t i n g P r e s i d e n t M a r y
Attenborough was in a hurry to
leave as she had a plane to catch.
She was taking up an invitation
to visit Chalmers University in
G o t h e n b u r g , S w e d e n , to
celebrate the 75th Anniversary oi
the f o u n d i n g of C h a l m e r s
University Students' U n i o n . She
will be away until Wednesday.
I C has academic links with
Chalmers which sends a group of
students in the 4th year of their
degree course to attend M . S c .
courses at IC. There are about 15
Chalmers' students here this year.
Chalmers' Rector was made an
honorary fellow of IC at the last
Commemoration Day. W h i l e
visiting the College he came into
contact with I C students in their
most down-to-earth state when he
entered the U n i o n Bar wearing a
dinner jacket and was greeted by
the comment l---ing dinner
jackets.
G R A N T S UP 13 PER C E N T
L o n d o n undergraduates are to
recieve £1,485 next year in a 13
per cent grant award announced
earlier this month, but there is to
be no change in the means test.
This means that the majority of
students will, continue not to
receive the full grant because
most parents do not pay the full
a m o u n t of t h e p a r e n t a l
contribution.
The increase awarded is less
than half the 27 per cent
demanded by the N a t i o n U n i o n
of Students. Another N U S
demand lor grants for 16 to 19
year old students has also been
ignored.
Education Secretary Shirley
Williams in her announcement of
the new grant rates said that the
Government had been prevented
from responding to the N U S
proposals because of the General
Election, but major changes
would be considered in the
t r i e n n i a l g r a n t s r e v i e w of
1980/81.
T h e home grant rate goes up to
£985 from £870 and the full grant
for students outside L o n d o n goes
up to £1245 from £1100. T h e
Government has promised similar
increases for postgraduates.
