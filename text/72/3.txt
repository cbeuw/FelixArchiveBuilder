THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL C O L L E G E
EDITOR: JOHN REKLBY. C i r c u l a t i o n s 1200
This FELIX i a Being sold on the l a s t day
of the f i r s t half-session, a time whioh. i a
generally quiet f o r the Union, and within, the
Colleges. Thia i a naturally so because f o r many
people i n the Mines and R.C.S. i t i s examination
time. The quietness i a as I t should he f o r we
should a l l take our examinations seriously.
Sinoe we oome to Imperial College f o r technol-
ogioal training seoond to none i n the oountry,
i t i s right that our work should oome f i r s t .
Any student of t h i s College who unnecessarily
neglects h i s work f o r other a c t i v i t i e s i s being
unfair, both to himself and to those people res-
ponsible f o r sending him here.
However we are members of a University ins-
t i t u t i o n here at I.C. and we owe obligations t o
the student body to which we belong. A Student
Union i s a self-contained community, and should
be a preliminary training ground f o r l i f e i n l a r -
ger and more adult communities. Yet how many of
us use the opportunities thus offered to beoome
p a r t i c i p a t i n g members of our community, coming to
terms with i t and obtaining a more mature outlook
on l i f e ? The answer of course i s , too few.
Out of 2000 students at Imperial College, a very
conservative estimate would be that 1000 take no
part i n any Union a c t i v i t i e s . Who are the miss-
ing 1000 ? Do they have no s o c i a l interests or
hobbies, or a sport to play ? Of course they do,
but their free time i s spent away from College,
the reason being the general d i f f i c u l t y and expense
of t r a v e l l i n g about London. With a College as
vast as ours, situated i n Kensington, r e s i d e n t i a l
schemes as. exist a t other U n i v e r s i t i e s are imposs-
i b l e ; although we f e e l that something oould,
and should be done f o r those people who would
l i k e t o l i v e nearer to I.C. , i f something were
provided.
The r e a l trouble i s too much apathy. Work
can be f i t t e d i n with Union a c t i v i t i e s and trav-
e l l i n g problems as many Union Officers have shown
i n the past. Even lunch-time a c t i v i t i e s are
supported by no more than 400 people, who we sus-
pect are the same people who j o i n i n during the
evenings and at weekends. As the College expands
we hope that more people w i l l make their Univer-
s i t y education a complete one, otherwise too much
w i l l continue to be done by" too few f o r too many.

It has been a short while since "Viewpoint"
appeared l a s t i n F e l i x , but the reoent Carnival
deserves no small oomment i n view of the atten-
dant happenings.
A Carnival i a the College equivalent of a
Chelsea Arts B a l l , and oosts a f i f t f j °f the amount
to attend. I n t h i s l i g h t , the ticket price i s
very reasonable, and the margin f o r p r o f i t i s neg-
l i g a b l e . The Guild's Carnival net l i a b i l i t i e s
t o t a l at least £110.
To balance these l i a b i l i t i e s , i f a working
figure of one hundred tickets i s used, then
tieket sales should have netted £100. About 70
tlekets were sold.
To quote the Evening Standard, a party of a
thousand people attended - we divide t h i s by four
to obtain a f a i r estimate - which gives us 250
people present.
Total present: 250
Present with tickets: 140
Present without tickets: 110
About £5 was collected In h a l f crown admission
to the Cabaret, that i s , 40 unpartnered men paid.
This leaves 70 people who paid nothing to attend -
2
8
?
£ of the number there.
"This Carnival has run at a bigger loss than
any previously" says a member of Guilds Entertain-
ments committee.
Is i t l i t t l e wonder that the Carnival runs at
a loss, with these unscrupulous people, i n the words
of the Yorkshire proverb, "Takin' a l l and payin' nowt"?
One does not need to contemplate long before
the r e a l i z a t i o n that Carnivals w i l l cease to exist,
with such a state of dishonesty, becomes apparent.
These people have come to expect danoing, buffet
and cabaret as free, gratis and f o r nothing.
There i s one solution: throw the louts out -
in the gutter where they belong.
F e l i x w i l l cake much pleasure i n printing the
names of such people after the next carnival.

L. 3. E.
On Wednesday, January 19th I,C. entertained
L.S.ii. to a Judo matoh. L.S.E. i s rather a new
club, and apart from one 1st Kyu, or brown belt,,
their team consisted of 6th Kyus, or white belts.
1.0. i n return fielded 6th Kyus, with one 5th
(yellow) and one 3rd Kyu (green). The I.e. begin-
ners did ,.ell, a l l winning their bouts, and the
older hands were also successful with well yrao
tised osotogari's, taiotosni's, and haraigoshi1
s.
L.S.E. also brought along Mr. Nakanishi, a
Japanese 4th Dan (Black Belt) now studying at L.S.S.
As there are very few men i n England of that high
a grade, l e t alone i n I.e., Mr. Nakanishi kindly
acted as referee. After the match, which resulted
in a 12 to 1 victory on points f o r I.e., he gave
valuable advice to both teams.
H.M.A. Sandhurst
The following Wednesday, Jan. 26th, I.C. went
down to Sandhurst. The Cadets team was fighting
Oxford, and I.C. fought a team consisting mostly of
wonderfully f i t P.T. instructors and other regular
Army instructors.
Burford succumbed to an ogoshi by one P.T.I.,
and seth did well to draw with an even bigger one.
Rotgans had an easier task, and convincingly beat a
languages lecturer, but after a battle of hip throws
Williams narrowly lost to a Grenadier sergeant.
Science as opposed to strength i s the principle
of Judo, but as one of our team discovered there i s
not a l o t one oan do s c i e n t i f i c a l l y when picked up
bodily anf hurled to the ground. One of tne most
interesting bouts was between the I.C. captain,
Macpnerv.on, and his cadet opponent, when osotogari
was matched by kbsotogari.
The f i n a l result was a win to the H.M.A. by
5 points to 4s. this being I.C.'s f i r s t defeat this
year.
