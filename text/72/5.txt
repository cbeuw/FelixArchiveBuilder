general Description
The glass was i n the form of a frustrated
none. Down one side was a f i s s u r e probably
caused by impaot. I t bore the i n s c r i p t i o n
"Property of G.W.H. . Not to be taken away."
Determination of Cubic Capacity
The number of times the mug had to be r e f i l l e d
to produce a sozzle factor of 10 was noted.
Determination of Suokabillty constant
To determine the Suckability Constant, the mug
was f i l l e d , and the contents drunk. The Suokabillty
Constant was found to be so good that t h i s test was
repeated a large number of times, u n t i l not only
were the contents drunk but the operators as w e l l .
I t was found to be very d i f f i o u l t to test a single
mug when one appears to have 2 mugs and twioe the
normal number of laboratory s t a f f .
Determination of Rate of flow
The rate of flow was measured with a Moving
3ucket ffallonometer of a type designed by Messrs.
3urp and Pardon of the Ministry of Alchohology.
The normal measuring cylinder of t h i s instrument
had been replaced by a reverberating Hick Cup of
our own design.
The integral of rate of :Jlow x time f o r
flow i n and out were found to be equal proving
tnus the empirical law that what goes i n must
come out. (This was found to be applicable to
operators as well.)

MIN
p i n t s / Min = f(mina)
Area under graph rep-
resents the volume
consumed.
PO/int p represents
the ultimate Sozzle
'Factor. This varies
from person to person
being nearly equal to
i n f i n i t y f o r Miners.
Comment on Design
The f i r s t thing about the mug that strikes
one, i s the foam. There ought to be some way
of removing i t . (A small fan perhaps with a
dancer to propel i t ) . Another improvement we
suggest, i s the provision of some form of alarm
to inform the operative that the mug i s nearly
empty so that steps could be taken to r e f i l l i t
before genuine <listress was caused.
Conclusions
As everyone knows, the conclusions are the most
important part of an experiment.
