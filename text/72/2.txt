Since the early hours or an October morning
i n 1933 the world has known the genial personality
of one Ivan Michael Abbott. Born and bred i n Sutton,
a Suffolk village where f o r the past eighteen years
his father has kept the l o c a l hostelry -'The Plough1
The second decade of his l i f e began at Lelston
grammar Sohool where he spent eight years i n a
carefree co-educational atmosphere. -Headers, can
you not see the environmental effect on ehara-cter
building up even at that age!.
1952 found him at Guilds pursuing h i s chosen
career of C i v i l Engineering. However i t was through
the R i f l e Club that he f i r s t became known. L i v i n g i n
the country he has and makes use of shooting rabbits
e t c ; surprisingly enough he HAS a licence. I t seems
that on one occasion during the war, whilst p r a c t i s -
ing p i s t o l shooting with a U.S. army revolver, he
nearly shot the cat,descendants of which must s t i l l
be f e e l i n g the blast. His steady eye- no comment -
has earned him iris I.C. f u l l colours f o r shooting.
However this year h i s happy smile, or should
I say lecherous leer, graces Council i n the capacity
of Entertainments Chairman and i t i s i n this post
that most of you w i l l recognise the above p o r t r a i t .
He has wandered around the world on Vac. jobs
over the past four years to places as f a r apart as
Stockholm and the London Docks. In the former h i s
steady eye was 'put out' for a while after he c o l l i -
ded with a lampost through looking at a passing
g i r l . She certainly gave him the eye - a black one!
In I.C. Hostel he i s well known f o r h i s loud
'good-nights' and h i s referring to intruders as
miserable pieces of turf.Mention must be made of
the lampshades i n h i s room. Their colour i s not
blue f o r a boy or red f o r but a subtly Ivannic
shade of pink!
His hobbies are women and c o l l e c t i n g earrings -
an excellent combination.
He l i k e s Swedish coffee, h i s pipe and throwing
- t r i f l e .
He d i s l i k e s loudly t i c k i n g clocks,early r i s i n g
ahd being on tne receiving end of an airborne t r i f l e .
F i n a l l y , as a t i p to would be party pivers here
is u i s recipe for a good oup of coffee:
as hot as h e l l , as black as night and as sweet
as love.

Apart from the Carnival, the main social
event since the last issue was last Sat-
urday's Charity Hop. This Hop was a great
success from a l l points of view and re-
minded one of the better Hops of
the good old Gym and Upper Dining Hall days of
last year. There was a complete s e l l out of r a f f l e
tickets for a bottle of " grand old Scotch liqueur
whisky",and 'Hags' conducted the Dutch Auction with
much aplomb. We feel that he has probably missed
his vocation i A sobering influence, however, was
the Soccer Captain's black tHe and dark suit - for
the Cup semi-final we didn't win,but the gay atmos-
phere soon cheered him up. (Jueenie's Bar was perhaps
her best effort i n that direction to date!
For the s t a t i s t i c i a n , approximately £30 was raised
for the B r i t i s h S.T.F., £7 from the Tax at the door
and £4.10 from the r a f f l e and Dutch auction. The
Entertainments Committee extent a big THANK YOU to
a l l who helped to make the Hop a success.
Though spoiling someone's committee meeting i s not
quite comme 11 faut, bis pueri senes,and the third
year Miners successfully diverted many Guildsraen
bound for a metallurgy lecture to the Metallurgy
Library, where Chairmen and Secretary became quite
hot under their collars as heads popped round >he
door at the rata of ten a minute. A l l was taken i n
good s p i r i t and perhaps forthcoming exams had some-
thing to do with this childishness.
The Guild's Carnival, reported elsewhere, appears
to have raised some controversy regarding the pos-
i t i o n of future carnivals. I t seems that Carnivals
are rapidly becoming a shamblas and i f they degen-
erate further, some one i n authority i s going to
put a stop to them. When we visited the Guilds
Carnival at about 6.40 there seemed to be l i t t l e
superficial signs of hooliganism and a few die-hard
couples appeared s t i l l to be enjoying themselves i n
their.various ways I Perhaps there were numerous
newspaper reporters' prostrate bodies secreted i n some
special room.
Felix i s produced under some duress this week. The
Editor was considering publishing a page blank but
for the notice 'Gone to Exams - back after Half
Session1
.
We are informed that the London Police
have set up a speed trap opposite to City and
Guilds College. A gentleman, clad only i n a
d i r t y raincoat, can be seen standir.g on the
opposite side of the road, watching the top of
Exhibition Road. On seeing a vehicle t r a v e l l -
ing faster than i t should, hs waves an off-
white handkerchief vigorously to attract his
partner at the bottom of the read.
Don't forget to wave back'.
