Not only was a FELIX reporter present at the
Guilds Carnival on Jan. 21st., the EVENING STAND-
ARD also was there. An item entitled "Cavemen"
appeared In the "In London last night" column of
their next day's issuo. Although the write-up was
very flattering from some points of view, i n other
â€¢aspects i t was Just plain inaccurate. These gossip
columnists Just don't know what goes on.
This was the STANDARD'S description of
Carnival:-
the
Bones, animal hides, prehistoric birds
and charcoal braziers decorated an enormous
cave where druids and cavewomen danced
wearing bath towels and leopard skins. Stud-
ents at the City and Guilds College, Ken-
sington were celebrating the New Year with
a carnival.
f\ pterodactyl - a prehistoric flying mam-
mal - was suspended from the c e i l i n g of one
of the three dance floors.
During the buffet at mldnlt_*.t there was
a fight with t r i f l e pudding. At eight this
morning breakfast was served to the remnants
of a party of more than a thousand people.
Judging by the tone of the whole thing the
Standard was expecting a small Chelsea Arts B a l l .
With a touch of imagination (stimulated by alcohol
perhaps?) our snack bar with decorations might be
likened to an enormous cave, Oh Where! - did the
1000 people come from?
The sentence about the fight with t r i f l e pud-
ding was unfortunately quite correct, and that i s
not the kind of publicity for our Carnivals.
The decorators set about their task with much
vigour and o r i g i n a l i t y . Perhaps the Snack Bar
did not look quite l i k e a vast cavern as they
had hoped, but the effect was good and the
innovation of having two bars most popular.
The decorations were definitely the high
spot of the evening but the cabaret, i n suite
of the hard work put i n by the performers,
was for the most part rendered inaudible by
the audience. Only Mr. B a s i l Svans was able to
quell the r i o t whilst he gave a rulphecitulph
at ion which amused us a l l even i f only half
understood 1
The buffet degenerated into a t r i f l e fight
and the Jazzmen i n the Upper Dining H a l l , apart
from the indomitable Johnny Parker, tendefl to
f l a g after a while.
But i n general the majority did have the
good time they looked for

The Refectory Committee met on Monday 24th
January. The main part of the meeting dealt with
problems of alternative catering arrangements after
Saster. As yet, nothing definite has been decided
but both the Rector and the Planning Dept. regard
the matter as being urgent. I t i s very probable
that i n addition to Ayrton H a l l and the new tem-
porary Refectory i n the Union Building, an addit-
ional room w i l l be available i n the neighbourhood.
The Easter closing w i l l be complicated t h i s year
by the fact that kitchen equipment i n the Union
Building has to be transferred from the West end
of the building to the temporary space on the s i t e
of the Old Lounge. This w i l l put the Refectory
out of action for probably the whole of the vac-
ation. Alternative arrangements w i l l be made to
cope with this situation so that meals w i l l be
obtainable within the college during the vacation,
except f o r the normal f i v e days closing over the
Easter period.
Other business discussed by the Committee
was the announcement that a N u t r i t i o n expert,
Miss Ward, w i l l shortly make a survey of the nut-
r i t i o n a l value of our menu. In succession to
the Rector, Professor Ubbelohde has been appoin-
ted Chairman of the Wine Committee.
The Ayrton H a l l sub-couimittee were able to
report that Ayrton H a l l was now f u l l y available
for evening functions, and that f a c i l i t i e s had
been made f o r Attendants and f o r Ladies Cloak-
room space.
