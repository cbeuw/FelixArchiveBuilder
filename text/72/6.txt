UNIVERSITY CUP SEMI FINAL
GOLDSMITHS ONE, I.C. NIL.
Though thara was no lack of s p i r i t in this Cup
gaaa, there was a lack of good football, partic-
ularly from I.C. who did not make f u l l use of the
"ball whan they had i t . I t was disappointing be-
cause they had tw«~*hlrdB of the play.
At 2.19 on I Battarsaa Polytechnic Ground,, GoI&mi
smiths kicked off,with a strong wind blowing across
from their l e f t . . I.C. soon went into the attack
coming near to scoring and forcing a corner. The
Goldsmiths defence withstood this i n i t i a l pressure
and the gas* developed into a raldfleld thrust and
parry with I.e. having most of the b a l l and looking
• • i f they war* s e t t l i n g down. They were rarely a
cause Of trouble to Goldsmiths goalkeeper tiough,
and occasional 'Smiths raids produced fine saves
toy McLeaan. So ended the f i r s t half with no score.
The seoond half* continued very much In the same way
M the f i r i t had ended, but the Goldsmiths raids
were looking very dangerous. Soon wo saw Dytham
kicking clear with lloLeaan beaten. I.C. then attack-
ad and Brindley headed a good corner from the right
wing that H i Just • l i t t l e too high for him over
the bar. Soon after this came the Goldsmiths break-
sway which was to produce their goal which was a
well taken chance from clever exploitation of the
weaknesses In the I.C. defence.
Though exciting to watch, the game began to degen-
erate and became rather scrappy. A near miss for
I.C. came however when Bay, diving, headed Just past
the post. Until the f i n a l whlatle I.C. continued
to press for an equaliser but the Goldsmiths defence
were never rattled.
Goldsmiths deserved to win. I.C. should have made
more use of the long b a l l out to their wingers and
the wing halves might be c r i t i c i s e d for playing too
much of an •ttacking game leaving their opposing
inside forwards very often unmarked.
I.C. TEAM: MeLeman, Anderson. Dytham, Moore, Richards
Blaokall, May, Hoigate, Green(Capt), Brindley, Hodge.
L.Locke, a former University player who s t i l l occas-
ionally plays for I.e., was chosen to play for the
Scotland amateur XI versus Falkirk on Monday 71st of
January, He Is now playing for Bromley.

Last Saturday Q.M.C. organised their annual ^^ mile
race at Brentwood In Essex,an event regarded as the
University 7 i mile championships.
The Banks shield for the winning team went to
University College who also supplied the individual
winner,D.Richards, with a time of 4Im-54s.
A bout of influenza appeared to have circulated
the University cross country clubs,which reduced
the number of starters to thirty three,an unusu-
a l l y small number for this event.The most seriously
affected team was Kings who couldn't even manage
to raise a team.Because of this the expected struggle
for the second teas place between King's and I.C.
never materialised.Instead I.C. who were without
Dearden and Meller (viotlms of the 'flu.) had a
long and interesting b u t t 1
* with Q.M.C. who were
at f u l l strength,Imperial Just beating the home
team by f points.
Evans(4 th),Basley(5th),Stewart(14th).Turner(16th)

College,who won last year's Cambridge University

an even share of the ball.The backs lacked
cohesion and the St.Catherine's l e f t wing scored
three good tries,two of which were converted from
near the touch-line.
