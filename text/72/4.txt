LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
I.e. Hostel.
The Editor,
FELIX.
Dear S i r ,
May I take advantage of the spaoe offered
by your columns to a i r a few thoughts on the sub-
ject of Carnivals.
The great thing about Carnivals Is that
tney represent some of the few occasions In the
year men everyone Is intent on enjoying themselves
You can get to know anyone, do or say almost any-
thing and know that i t won't be held against you on
the following day.
as well as giving people a ohanoe to t r y
their hand at decorations and humoroub dramatics,
tney enable them to get to know the opposite s e x —
anall we s a y — a l i t t l e better, and to l e a r n t h e i r
own capacity for alcohol} and why not? We have to
learn sometime, and among one's friends at I.C.
seems to me the best place that one could wish to
do i t .
personally, though, I am not sure that
we are achieving our object at the moment, as there
i s a definite increase i n general i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t y
as d i s t i n c t from free and esay enjoyment.
I nave never been completely sober at a
Carnival, myself, except onoe when I was recovering
from a party the night before, so this i s not
written from any narrow-minded viewpoint.
It i s quite noticeable that, however,
that the cabarets are having more and more d i f f i -
culty in.making themselves heard, and the breakages
in the refectory and the bar have increased alarm-
ingly. I s f l i n g i n g t r i f l e across the refectory
r e a l l y fun after i t ceases to be o r i g i n a l , and did
the people who tore down a large quantity of the
decorations at the Mines' Carnival during the f i r s t
hour r e a l i s e that they were destroying the work of
their fellow students?
Of course they almost certainly weren't
sober, and perhaps that i s r e a l l y the point. Isn't
a d d i n g one's liquor? as the saying goes, not mere-
ly a matter of physically holding i t , but of showing
that you are a reasonable character when the s h e l l
of sobriety i s washed away, and i f you f i n d that
you're not, of doing something about i t .
This, of course, probably means that I
can't hold mine, so perhaps we a l l ought to think
about i t .

Dear S i r ,
Investigations are being made by a group of
I.C. students into the state of Morality within
the college, they asked one of their number to
write a report on the Guilds' Carnival. Happily,
t h i s reporter was quickly Imbued with alcoholic
a p i r i t , rather than the s p i r i t of righteousness,
so possibly this report w i l l not be written i n
a form acceptible to those who wish to decry the
behaviour of I.e.
It i s f e l t by these students that I.C. i s
immoral, and that the outward manifestations of
t h i s i s evident from the conduct of those e.t the
Guilds' Carnival. s i r ! Immorality implies
coarseness and vulgarity. I f we were s J, then
the J e l l y Battle i n the refectory would have
degenerated into a punching brawl. B'.t no. We
soon wont across to " l i s t e n " to the Ct-oaret. The
audience were kept waiting, so they trapt the show
waiting - and how! The Cabaret wen-, on bravely,
but itt was a case of who could shou. the loudest.
One side having many times the voijes, and the
other, a couple of microphones (rraerophones?)
With a l l this chaos, including 1jsing of scripts,
collapse of curtains, and near iestruction of
musical instruments, not once j i d any one be-
come crude or offensive.
Everyone had a j o l l y d i>ime at the Carnival
and i t i s about time t h i s siapid confusion between
"Immorality" and "Good Tlae-' ended.

The navigation r a l l y held l a s t Friday night
was a great auoeas, even though i t was the f i r s t
time an a l l night r a l l y had been organised by the
C ft d Motor Club. Seventeen drivers signed on
at the •Peggy Bedford}" - near London Airport - and set
off with t h e i r crews about 10 p.m. on a 100 mile
search f o r an even greater number of Guildsman
hidden at obscure points among the chilterns.
To f i n d the f i r s t point, Competitors hadto
tramp about i n a swamp. The hidden marshals had
to exeroiae the greatest restraint on hearing the
searchers c a l l i n g f o r them i n the strongest tones
fin/i terms, One navigator was heard blowing a
whistle f r a n t i o a l l y f o r a marshal (who of course
did not appear to the summons). Even so, one poor
man, deeply discouraged, wandering vaguely around
holding h i s route card i n h i s hand wa s amazed when
someone he was about to pass took h i s card from him
and" time checked i t ! One would have thought that
the t i t l e of a point, "Everest", would have lead
t i r e d competitors to expect some relaxation but the
sight of a row of l i g h t s leading to a tent at the
top of a h i l l unaccountably caused him to climb the
thing rather than search at the foot where the
marshal was patiently waiting.
The course eventually lead to the halfway
point where a short break could be taken. Amuse-
ments were provided - the Chief Perpetra or i n v i t -
ing a l l navigators to a round of golf 'At Two
O'clock i n the Morning'. After envious glances at
the Organisers' cooking arrangements - and Cook -
the Competitors went "To the Woods". The marshals
and the Moustache so well known i n 20 were only
located a f l e r a chase over numerous ploughed f i e l d s .
Then to Che>-,ham to "Late Night F i n a l " where the
language was said to be the worst on the whole r a l l y
due to the i l l u s i v e positions of the Marshals and
the f r i v o l o u s notices they had exhibited. After
a further point, cunningly concealed among Burnham
Beeches, back to the f i n i s h at "June's Cafe" where
competitors clocked o f f a t about 5.30 a.m. and
strengthened themselves f o r the journey home with
cups of coffee and plates of ? and chips.
Opinions on the r a l l y , although i n particular
cases unprintable, were generally very favourable.
The organisers wish to take t h i s oportunity of
thanking a l l the many people who have helped to
make t h i s event so enjoyable.
The f i r s t I.C man (seoond man home) was
K.G. Hound — Wolseley 18. The f i r s t motor-
c y c l i s t was Bob Walker, R.C.S.
Thirteen people out of the seventeen starters
finished the course. I t was said that the four
non-finishers found t h e i r female companions too
distracting.

Dear S i r ,
We .i e heard mueh of the mission to Catholios
and Non-C hollos i n recent days. We found i t
quite novt . to disoover those l i t t l e oards posted
in every iLgeon-hole i n the Union racks and surely
that staau1
& have brought the Ulaaiom ta the notice
of praeti a l l y a l l th e students In the college.
But no. Jne further aot of intrusive publicity
was deem'd neoessary by the organisers.
We /rare not amused to s i t down i n the Refectory
and f i n staring at us from the middle of the table
yet mo?e of these oards. We feel that some means
of oor crol should be exerted over the publioity
metjicis of certain clubs and societies. Publioity
stupi^d be uonfined to the notioe-boards provided f o r
the purpose and possibly to oanvassing i n entrance
h a l l s , etc. I t should NOT be allowed to intrude on
r-ir daily habits, and particularly not on our meals.
Yours sincerely,
T.Bailey,
G.Grimshaw.
