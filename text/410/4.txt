Theatre A magnificent production
Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2
T H E R O Y A L S H A K E S P E A R E C O M P A N Y
a e currently presenting 'n repertory
Shakespeare's trilogy concerned with
the education of Henry V in kingship.
Terry Hands' three productions (Henry
V was reviewed last week) have now
been transferred from Stratford-upon-Avon
to the R S C ' s London home at the A l d w y c h .
The unity of style with which the
three plays are presented, is perhaps
their most striking feature. For, having
seen all three, it is difficult to realise
how they could be performed or seen
individually. They are indeed an e p i c
story of H a l ' s progress from his d i s s o l u t e
life with Falstaff and his companions in
Eastcheap to the field at Agincourt.
A l a n Howard g i v e s a marvellously
controlled performance; as Hal both in
Eastcheap and at court w h e r e he
resolutely faces his father's wrath. It is
in the two reconciliation scenes, before
Shrewbury in part 1 and before his
father's death in part 2, that the drama
really comes a l i v e . Henry IV, played by
Emrys James, makes no pretence of the
fact that, now he has wrested the crown
from his cousin Richard II, he is going
to die a natural death with the crown still
firmly in place. In part 1 it is the threat
from Northumberland that he fears most.
Northumberland's son, Harry Percy (Stuart
Wilson), makes a telling contrast with
Hal as he raves on the iniquities that
the king has visited on his family. In
part 2, as the king is near to death, it is
the apprehension that his kingdom may
be lost by his son that worries him most;
here H a l ' s more patriotic brothers who
support their father's every move are
used as the yardstick by which we can
measure H a l ' s transgressions.
Brewster M a s o n ' s Falstaff towers over
all the others. Not only is he remarkably
fat, a state that can be achieved by
judicious padding, but he seems' to have
greater height, in his bare feet, and a
larger head than anyone e l s e . Unfortunately
he gives the impression that he has
played the part so often in the past that
it has now become a bore.
Terry Hands is clearly in control in
these magnif icient productions. Shakespeare
left very few stage directions in the
text but the wealth of imaginative detail
that has been put in deserves the highest
praise.The three plays have been examined
in the finest detail for possible doubles
entendres and idiosyncracies of character
in the text, making the performances
more comprehensible than most Shakespeare
productions are to modern audiences.

M u s i c High voltage Runt
Todd nundgren's U T O P I A - Another L i v e (Bearsville)
I must admit that I've a l w a y s had
something of a penchant for Rundgren's
music. Todd is s t i l l a more viable
proposition at his self-indulgent nadir
(ie his last two albums) than many of
the poseurs that have found their way
onto the turntables of unsuspecting
punters.
T h i s live album is far and above
a better record than Utopia or Initiation,
not that it is without a few faults typical
of the Runt. Most of them come with
the only acoustic feature ' W h e e l s ' ,
which shows the man at his most lyrically
asinine, the melody too is pretty non-
descript. The song i s flanked by two
other new tunes. 'Another L i f e ' , which
opens the album, could be plucked from
the A W A T S e l p e e , showing T o d d ' s
music at its melodic and industrious best,
the song being full of the high voltage
electricity which permeates the rest of
the album. 'Seven R a y s ' , although again
lyrically doubtful, has enough going for
it to sustain the listeners interest.
A g a i n high on melodic content, the
song employs at various stages up to
three synthesiser players, providing a
controlled barrage of warp sound. Rundgren
is o n e of the few people who can use
e x c e s s i v e techno-flash and still make
viable music, unlike say E L P , who
have mastered the technique of musical
farting.
Side two opens with ' I n t r o / M r T r i s c u i t s ' ,
a short instrumental excursion featuring
the Human C a p i c i t o r dueling it out with
a lively synthesiser. Only Rundgren
could then let the tune fall effortlessly
into a B e m s t e i n / S o n d h e i m standard
from West Side Story, namely 'Somethings
C o m i n g ' , without making a complete
p i z z l e of himself. IT works beautifully.
We are then treated to two straight rockers,
that is if any of Rundgren's music can
be c a l l e d 'straight'. The brilliant
'Heavy Metal K i d s ' , s t i c k s pretty c l o s e
to the high energy original that appeared
on the ' T o d d ' double, the Runt's acid
guitar solo mixed down with the band,
but s t i l l managing to penetrate the
melee of notes provided by the rest of
the m u s i c i a n s . Then it's straight into
the old Move number ' D o Y a ' , which is
almost as good as the latter. F i n a l l y ,
the band return to ground control with

Profile: Riz Shakir
"If students feel that a national
body like NUS is not required at all,
in any shape or form, then we should
disaffiliate... it we think that there is
a need for a national body which
represents our views, negotiates on our
behalf, runs a profitable travel service,
has competent leadership — (this is
what NUS could be if a little bit of
effort was made by the average student) —
then they should vote to stay in".
If what students desired was a
change in N U S , then he felt the best
way to do this was from within N U S for
the simple reason that our v o i c e s would
not be listened to or even heard from
without.
R i z is an independent sort of chap,
and this is reflected in h i s plans when
he leaves c o l l e g e . H e hopes eventually
to run a business of his own. Although
time has prevented him playing the various
and multitudinous sports he enjoys, there
has not been too much of an obstacle to
h i s favourite sport — shooting.
He sums it up: "Perhaps above
everything else, my interest is shooting.
This is something a lot of people
reserve opinion about and I respect
their opinions. But, I think, with all
due respect, they don't know what it
involves. A shooting person knows a
great deal more about the animals,
understands them much better, because
you have to learn their habits and
behaviour. This brings one closer to
nature and since man is an integral
part of nature, it improves one's
understanding of mankind".
T h i s then is R i z Shakir, a man of
assonate personality; with 'definite
the sedate ' J u s t One Victory' c u l l e d
from the A W A T S album.
J u s t , how much of this twelve inch
piece of plastic is truly a ' l i v e ' album,
recorded as it happened is anybody's
guess. I mean as far as production goes
this man is such a master of the overdub
he makes Mike Oldfield look positively
clumsy. For instance, I was a little
disappointed with his performance at
Hammersmith a few months back, feeling
that his band Utopia played it all a bit
flat, not creating any real 'atmosphere'.
Yet a couple of weeks ago, Radio One
put out an 'In Concert' (produced and
re-mixed by Rundgren) of this very
same gig, and to hear that you'd have
thought it one of the best performances
by an artist in years. I suppose s c i e n c e
has finally got to grips with r o c k ' n ' r o l l .
Anyway, what has to be judged is the
end product and as far as that goes, this
record is on the whole very fine indeed.
Recommended for anyone who was
unfortunate enough to pick up on Rundgren
with his last two efforts, and so perhaps
misjudge the man's talent.

Dear F E L I X Readers,
A s you may have noticed, the
