T h i s is a subjective review of what
is arguably the best, smallest and
cheapest side of London's vast cinema
world. Some of these cinemas are undeniably
the haunt of beardy wierdies lost in the
s i x t i e s and beautiful intelekchools, but
they do show excellent and very varied
films. Most project a different film
each night; for details see " T i m e O u t "
in the Haldane Library or from newsagents
price 25p each Thursday.
.Electric Cinema C l u b , 191 Portobello
Road, Wil 7 2 7 - 4 9 9 2 ) Membership 15p
per annum.
Probably the best alternative and
ndependant cinema in London. A catholic
selection of films are shown from early
E i s e n s t e i n to late Leone, from B horror
movies such as " T h e Corpse C r u s h e r s "
to F e M i n i ' s "8V2". They tend to have
seasons of films based very loosely
around a theme and show each film
several times in a week.
The cinema is in a grotty district
(especially at night), it is ancient and
scruffy, the seats are hard and uncomfortable
if you are thinly padded, but a double
bill c o s t s only 75p. Late night shows
at weekends. C a n be reached by 52 bus
or tube to Notting H i l l Gate and w a l k .
Gate Cinema, Notting H i l l Gate (727 - 5 7 5 0 )
A recent and welcome addition to Londons
other cinema minorama. Its late night
film club seems to have expired but its late
night f i l m s live on. A continuous
performance feature is shown through
the day and early evening; they have a
predilection for new German films at the
moment and are showing F a s b i n d e r s
" F o x " . E a c h evening at 11.15 this
makes way for a double bill of assorted
films; the hits of the 4 0 ' s , 5 0 ' s and
6 0 ' s . It is a plush, comfortable with a
beautiful c i e l i n g (if you like those sort
of things) but is expensive. To be found
on " t h e G a t e " (as it is known) at
Notting H i l l ; tube or 52 bus from the
Albert H a l l , or a short walk up Kensington
Church St.
' C A , Nash House, The M a l l , SWI (930-6393)
The Institute of Contemporary Arts as it
is rather pontifically known, lives in a
grand setting underneath the aches on the
Mall near Trafalgar Square. Student
membership is £2 a year and entitles
use of its s o c i a l f a c i l i t i e s and 10p off
each cinema performance. Not really
worth it for the odd film, which c o s t s
75p for each programme. Rather fond- of
showing political and s o c i a l l y meaningful
films but should not be d i s m i s s e d with
such a sweeping generalisation. To get
there take bus numbers 9 and 14 to
P i c a d i l l y C i r c u s then walk south down
lower Regent St to the m a l l . It's under
the first arch on the left at the base of
the steps.

German films are the vogue. The late

the rest of the week cost £ 1 . Present

and contemporary films from all over
the world.
Kai F a F i l m C l u b , Hong Kong C i n e m a ,

Concerts
Power, drive and control
R E N A I S S A N C E ' S C O N C E R T last Saturday
was not . so much an assault upon the
sense, more a calculated d i s s e c t i o n of
them. It was a brilliant concert, by any
standards; embodying power, drive and
control to produce one of the best gigs at
IC for many a day.
The scene was set by Bob P e g g , a
worthy country folk singer well beloved
by all F o l k C l u b veterans, who kept the
audience happy with his usual blend of
self-composed tales of the North, playing
his guitar and tin whistle simply and
effectively. Indeed some people came to
see " t h e Bob Pegg c o n c e r t " !
I would have said that Mr Pegg
warmed the audience up, but that would
not be strictly true a s , in fact, the hall
was blood c o l d , as John Camp remarked
When R e n a i s s a n c e took to the stage at
later.
By that time, people were getting
r e s t l e s s . The T V cameras had trundled
up and down the packed hall a couple
of times, and I had finished my can of
N e w k y . The lights suddenly faded, the
stage was enveloped in darkness, and'
R e n a i s s a n c e hit town going straight into'
"I C a n ' t U n d e r s t a n d " .
For those of you who know their
m u s i c , they played a variety of the old and
the new; " R u n n i n g H a r d " , " O c e a n
G y p s y " , "Mother R u s s i a " , " P r o l o g u e
(from way b a c k ) " , and the excellent
" S c h e h e r a z a d e " , the title work of their
last album.
If you are not so well acquainted with
the band and you did not read F E L I X
last week, they are a five-man group:
percussion, p i a n o ; a c o u s t i c and bass
guitar and Annie Haslam on v o c a l s . Their
" c l a s s i c a l i n f l u e n c e s " are most prevalent
in the excellent work of the pianist,
John Tout, whose use of the synthesiser
was exemplary. The power behind the
band's music comes from the drummer,
Terry S u l l i v a n , and bass man John
Camp, around whom much of the music
e v o l v e s . He also plays the bass organ
pedals, so, all in a l l , he is a pretty
important part of their sound.
T h i s really is a band to s e e . T h e
whole concert swept along in a vein of
vitality and aggression, the band playing
loud, but maintaining good sound quality.
It was refreshing to be actually able to
hear the words being sung without
straining. The use of special effects
aided, rather than detracted from the
performance. The encore, " A s h e s A r e
B u r n i n g " , (another L P title track)
fairly pinned the audience to the floor,
e s p e c i a l l y when John Camp launched
himself into his solo.
At the end of the piece, no-one
c a l l e d for another encore — the band
could not possibly have had anything
more to give.
You may have gathered that I liked
this gig — I d i d , and so did everyone
else there. Thanks, R e n a i s s a n c e .
