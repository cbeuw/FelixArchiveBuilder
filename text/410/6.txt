Perhaps you suffered the dubious pleasure of w a i t i n g i n long queues at s o c i a l
s e c u r i t y o f f i c e s l a s t Christmas. Perhaps you had a problem with claiming your rent
or the cohabitation r u l e . I f you are a n t i c i p a t i n g going through a l l that again t h i s
Easter then read on!
THERE MAY BE A CHANCE OF SETTING UP A SPECIAL STUDENT CENTRE IF WE CAN SHOW ENOUGH
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE IT.
Therefore please f i l l i n the f o l l o w i n g questionaire and return i t to the Welfare
pigeon hole i n the Union O f f i c e or by i n t e r n a l mail to SUE KALICINSKI, WELFARE
OFFICER, IC UNION.
At present the question of whether students should be able t o claim at a l l hangs
i n the balance. Such a centre would be an extremely h e l p f u l way of minimising the
antagonism caused by students overloading l o c a l s o c i a l s e c u r i t y o f f i c e s . In your own
i n t e r e s t s f i l l i n t h i s form.
If anyone wishes to give me t h e i r opinions i n person I ' l l be at the Welfare
Centre (top of the Union) Monday-Friday, 12.30-1.30pm.
