Deserved win for IC
Imperial College 1st XI 2
St Bernards Hospital 0
H A V I N G s u c c e s s f u l l y located
the playing fields, the pitch,
the changing rooms, the T V
lounge and the opposition
the 1st's then changed to
face a team for St Bernards
H o s p i t a l . IC started well on
a completely solid pitch and
soon looked the better side
under the conditions. With
a great deal of movement from
the forwards, (probably trying
to avoid frostbite) the hospital
defence was soon under
pressure; Trev Tutu causing
all sorts of problems on the
right wing. However ICs first
goal came from a Sig Golding
cross, well picked up by Trev
Tutu whose shot hit the post
half way up, and Bob Middleton
scored from the rebound.
With the midfield trio
picking up most of the loose
b a l l s (brass monkeys beware),
IC looked much the better side
up to half time, when, all the
team were provided with cups
of tea except Trev Tutu who
went to make sure the changing
room was locked.
Despite a shaky start to the
second half, IC gradually
moved beck into the game,
Nigel Woodhouse at centre
half having a fine match.
Now we come to the highlight
of the game, the second goal,
scored f r o m I fanfares
Trumpets i a short comer.
A Mike Isles shot was deflected
and A l i s t e r R o s s scored from
c l o s e in. IC now had the
game secured, St Bernards 2nd
in the League, started to get
frustrated and the game began
to get a bit p h y s i c a l . However
in the end IC finished the
deserved winners with a good
team performance, well worth
the two points.
Team:- C Brown, J Marshall,
JCook, KHoulden, N Woodhouse,
J Andrews, S Golding, M Isles,
R Middleton, A Ross, T Tutu.
Last minute goal
earns I C a draw
Imperial College XI 2
City University 2
A F T E R T H E good performance
on the previous Saturday, the
1st XI started well against
C i t y , most of the play being
in their half for the first 20
minutes. T h i s was rewarded
by a fine opportunist goal from
Ramesh F a t a n i a mid way
through the half. However
concentration lapsed at the
back and two goals were
quickly conceeded just before
halftime.
C i t y started the second
well and at one point looked
set for a w i n , but IC fought
back and gradually the play
switched to the other end.
Despite the pressure, the
necessary goal was not
forthcoming and C i t y , still
looking good on the break,
almost scored again, Hugh
Barrat saving well on the line.
However with the last hit of
the match, Sig Golding scored
from a Trev Tutu cross after
Bob had missed the ball
again (dummy?)
On reflection a good fight
back, but it would have been
unnecessary had the defence
been tigher in the first half.
Good performances from
Ramesh F a t a n i a and John
(the Umpire) Latter. (
Team: C Brown, J Marshall, H
Barrett, K Houlden, A Brown,
J Andrews, S Golding, R Ratania,
R Middleton, A Ross, T Tutu.
Aching men's feet
T H E W E E K started with an
eventful run against Brunei
and Surrey U n i v e r s i t i e s , the
latter an unexpected guest
team, who then demanded a
tea.
The race was won by the
man with the watch, Rob
A l l i n s o n in 28.10. A minute
later the pride of the IC team
was restored, after a prolonged
spring in by Ian E l l i s who
just managed to defeat J
Mahon, inflicting on him the
same punishment that Rob
was given last season. The
IC team managed to win by
scoring s i x runners (any
other number would have lost
us the match) by the effort of
Dave 'have a Carrot' Jones and
Rich 'I don't believe the time'
Harrington.
After a bad run on the
Wednesday, Andy ' F l a k e r '
Davey made a c l a s s i c non-
appearance at the Southern
Counties C r o s s - C o u n t r y
Championships. The temperature
was below zero, and the
ground was frozen. In spite
of this, eleven IC runners
clocked up almost 100 miles
in this gruelling race.
Rob A l l i n s o n once again
led the team home in 92nd
position, Dave Rosen of
Orienteering fame came next
for IC finding the going more
to his liking than Steve " I t ' s
a real r a c e " Webb, who came
next.

Better luck next timel
A l l the starters for IC
finished the c o u r s e , a
c o m e n d a b l e performance,
considering the distance and
the number of frozen ruts just
waiting for someone to sprain
an ankle in.
The after-race enquiry was
held in " T h e F l a c k " and it
concluded that we couldn't
have done better if we had
tried, however by the " H o r s e
and G r o o m " some members
had thought a little more
training might be in order,
and by the Nags Head had
decided ' to get up the next
morning to do some! Who
can blame them with the
St Edmund Hall relay so c l o s e ?
Table Tennis
IC overwhelmed
Imperial College 2nd 0
Paddington 1st 9
F O R T H E F I R S T time this
season both IC table tennis
teams were beaten in their
respective fixtures. At the
start of the week the unbeaten
division leaders came to IC
and showed why they are
the league's best team by
overwhelming our regular
second team 9—0. T h i s ends
the teams run of 7 league
victories in s u c c e s s i o n and
virtually secures the d i v i s i o n
title for Paddington 1st.
Promotion
chances cut
Imperial College 1st 4
Paddington 2nd 5
If this wasn't enough their
second team became the
first team to win against IC
1st on their home ground. At
one ' stage -IC were 3—1 up,
but the writing was on the wall
when Paddington won two
games after deuces in the
final s e t s . It now seems almost
certain that IC 1st won't win
their league, and unless the
team improves, it could even
drop to third place, and so
fail to get promotion. L e t ' s
hope next week sees a change
in form.
