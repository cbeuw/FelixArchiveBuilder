S U E W I N T E R B U R N , this
y e a r ' s B o ' B e l l e h a i l s from
Manchester. She i s a member
of the infamous C C D 1 and i s
an extremely active G u i l d s -
woman. Originally second to
the sensuous Tom F i s h e r in
the B o ' B e l l e e l e c t i o n , she
was elected after Tom resigned.
(He bad no intention of
wearing a dress).
In her.capacity as B o ' B e l l e ,
she thinks of little e l s e . To
her, B o ' i s a beautiful car and
her ambition i s to become B o '
driver. In fact, one of the
foremost reasons for her
wanting to p a s s her first
year exams i s so that she can
ride in B o ' on the Brighton
run next y ear.
Although not actively
involved with ICWA, Sue i s
Secretary of WIGS (Women in
G u i l d s ). WIGS has recently
been formed to encourage
more G u i l d s women to come
and join in U n i o n a c t i v i t i e s .
She b e l i e v e s that if women
make an effort they can do
all right for themselves at
I C , even with a ten-to-one
ratio.
Sue told F E L I X that many
men/boys at C o l l e g e are not
very gentlemanly. Incidently,
she was recently banned from
the Union bar after a slight
fracas with a Mr Z a k , the
circumstances of which were
not made clear to F E L ' X .
Sue has many interests,
apart from B o ' and C C D 1 . A s
a Mancunian she supports
the great Manchester U n i t e d ,
who, according to her, w i l l
win the double this season.
She recently took part in the
G u i l d s ' Rugby Sevens and
her team won 42—4 against
the Morons. She h a s just
added ballroom dancing to her
many extra—curricula a c t i v i t i e s .
Sue will not be standing for
any U n i o n posts this year,

The Future of Higher Education in Britain
" E d u c a t i o n ! ' ' said Eeyore bitterly jumping on his s i x s t i c k s .
"What is l e a r n i n g ? " asked Eeyore as he kicked his twelve
s t i c k s into the air, " A thing Rabit knows! H a ! "
"I t h i n k . . . " began P i g l e t , nervously.
" D o n ' t , " s a i d E e y o r e .
E l i t i s m ! T h a t ' s what Eeyore
suffered from, and apparently,
not through c h o i c e , we all shall
be a statistical elite until
higher education is a v a i l a b l e
to over 15% of the 1 8 - 2 2 y r s
age group.
T h i s is the view of Prof
Niblett, the guest speaker at
Si I wood Park on the last
Touchstone weekend. Our
desire for further education
could be a s s e s s e d by the
eagerness with which we
piled into the coach to be
taken as q u i c k l y and far as
possible from South K e n .
(Those of you who thought
Silwood Park an educational
establishment, think again;
they only do Botany and such
I ike there.)
" N o t a briefcase in s i g h t , "
I noted as we got off the
coach at S i l w o o d . C l e a r l y ,
everyone had come to d i s c u s s
higher education, not indulge
in any. After tea, the nitty-gritty
Prof Niblett talked about the
rapid growth of higher education
in the last 25 years, and the
broadened concepts of higher
education. U n i v e r s i t i e s , he
explained, have a tendency to
be too e l i t i s t , too academic,
and too research-orientated
(ouch!). P o l y t e c h n i c s , which
offer more subjects, and
cater for a wider cross-section
of students, were introduced in
1965 for this very reason.
The future of higher education
is in the hands of the increasing
number of people outside the
18—22 age bracket who demand
it. The open University
demonstrates the growth of
this demand: it now has
55,000 students, of a l l ages.
Yet it s t i l l cannot cope with
the floods of applications,
and has to refuse some who
wish to study with them.
Money is the key to increased
availability of higher education;
in the 1930's, about £2 million

was spent on university
education. Now the figure
exceeds £4000 million (in
1969, education spending
surpassed defence costs for
the first time.) A s s u m i n g
that no more money is a v a i l a b l e ,
what there is must be shared.
T h i s entails increasing the
student I staff ratio, cuts in
postgrad education (sorry,
Rick), charging overseas
students higher fees, (I plead
anonimity), and a cut down in
student residence (this isn't
really written in the comfort
of a Beit Hal I armchair.)
But there are other problems
to be faced when trying to
introduce mass higher education
(ie for more than 15% of the
18—22 age group), or U n i v e r s a l
higher education (over 50%).
A much wider range of courses
is needed, and the merits of
part-time education should be
fully explored.
Prof Niblett summed up by
comparing our higher education
system with those of other
countries. H e concluded
that the poor showing Britain
made, compared with Japan,
for instance, w i l l prompt the
Government into developing
higher education.
We returned, refreshed, from
supper, to d i s c u s s some of the
questions raised by Prof
N i b l e t t ' s lecture. We all had
a natural interest in the
subject, and the mistaken
impression that the whole
country revolved around higher
education could e a s i l y have
been taken by an onlooker.
The predicted figure for
1981 students in higher
education is 18% - and doubts
have been cast as to whether
or not demand will continue
to increase at its current
rate. "What about w o m e n ! "
someone should have shouted,
but didn't. (Our demands are
constantly increasing.) After
liquid refreshment, all retired,
and the d i s c u s s i o n resumed
after Sunday lunch.
Apart from the distinctly
male appearance of the
" a v e r a g e student" of the
future, the w e e k e n d ' s d i s c u s s i o n s
were very s u c c e s s f u l and
forward looking. It was with
regret that we boarded the
coach (after another very
satisfactory tea) and returned
to IC.
Incidentally, C o l l e g e is the
subject of the next Touchstone,
entitled " I C — Airport Culture
or C o m m u n i t y " . The guest
speaker is our very own
Sinclair Goodlad. I recommend
it most strongly — these week-
ends are enjoyable, informative,
and incredibly good value.
So, if you want a weekend in
the country, with as much
to eat as you can manage,
good company, and interesting
conversation, sign up for the
next one. It w i l l be the last
weekend in February, and
costs £1.50. Y o u might come
back feeling that education
is just something that Rabbit
knows, which is where I came
in.
