L A S T M O N T H the Consultative
Committee for Co-ordinating
D i s c u s s i o n on the Recommend-
ations of the Murray Committee
presented its fifth and final
report, in which it recommended
that the Committee be wound
up. So now the ball is in our
court, that i s , we must think
about what sort of federal
university we wish to be
part of, if a n y .
The most i m p o r t a n t
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n of the
Committee, which reported in
1972, w a s that the University
(of London) should a s k
Parliament for the power to
alter its own statutes without
recourse to Parliament. It is
expected that the University
w i l submit the B i l l for the
1976-77 session of Parliament.
Both University College,
and K i n g ' s College are seeking
to obtain their own charters
and statutes and when these
are granted, these c o l l e g e s
will leave the University
(of London). Imperial C o l l e g e
w i l l then be the largest
college in the University,
and will retain the present
financial arrangements, at
at least through the f 9 7 7 - 8 2
quiquennium. F o r those of you
who do not know about the
latter, the U G C makes a
recommendation to the Senate,
when allocating money for the
University as to how much of
the allocation should go to
IC. T h i s recommendation
is always followed by the
Senate.
I should be interested to
receive comments on the
matter of the University
and might possibly raise it
at the next Union meeting of
people who are interested.
St Andrews disaffiliates
from N U S
Last week St Andrews voted
to l e a v e , the National Union
of Students by 1,384 votes
to 6 5 3 . It is also reported
that two Cambridge c o l l e g e s
have decided to leave, no
doubt prompted by the recent
antipathy shown towards such
c o l l e g e s by the N U S E x e c u t i v e .
A s this article has to be
submitted before the vote at
Manchester (on Wednesday),
the result w i l l be elsewhere
in F E L I X . I expect the result
to be closer than at St Andrews,
but a higher turnout c a n be
anticipated.
Derrick Everett
Photographic Society
Lewinski lectures
Sit I . C
MR J S LEWINSKI is to visit
the C o l l e g e on February 10th
to give a lecture on modern
aspects of 35mm photography.
Mr L e w i n s k i , who is a senior
lecturer at the London C o l l e g e
of Printing, has had many of h i s
photographs published in
leading Sunday newspapers and
in August 1970, the National
Portrait Gallery bought 60
of Mr L e w i n s k i ' s prints for a
permanent c o l l e c t i o n .
In 1972,Mr L e w i n s k i also
held a one-man exhibition at
the G a l l e r y . In addition, he
has recently published a book
entitled, " C o l o u r in f o c u s " .
The book is the first of its
kind in its attempt to a s s e s s
and evaluate the nature of
photography as an independent,
creative medium of e x p r e s s i o n .
It deals extensively with
matters pertaining to subject
treatment, design and composi-
tion in colour.
The lecture being given will
a l s o include d i s c u s s i o n on
photography from the photo-
journalist's point of view. T h e
lecture will be held in the
Geology Lecture Theatre (room
2.28 in the Royal School of
Mines) and begins at 7.00pm.
Cross Country
Hyde Park Relay
The Cross Country C l u b ' s
major home event of the
year is to be held on Saturday
21st February, beginning at
15.00hrs at the Western end
of Rotten Row.
About 100 entries have been
received for the event from
student teams from a l l over
the Country as well as from
the Continent.
Each runner w i l l attempt to
complete a 3 mile circuit of
the Park as one of a team of
six running consecutively.
A good time for a s i x man team
would be in the order of
11
/i hours.
A number of marshal Is
are needed to direct the
runners on their correct
course and any offers of
help in this respect would
be rewarded by a free tea
plus a mystery item w h i c h ,
for security reasons, cannot
be revealed until the d a y .
Marshalls would be required
from 14.00hrs until about 17.00
hrs. If you think you may be
able to a s s i s t , please contact
Richard Harrington (by a note
in ' H ' of the Union letter
rack) or any member of the
cross-country club.
T h i s event is the largest
of its kind in the Country,
and is being supported by
the National Westminster
Bank.
Stater Patter
What are you doing this
summer?
We have obtained, at
considerable expense, several
books which could help you
when looking for something
to do this summer. T h e titles
are as follows: 1976 Summer
Employment Directory of the
US, 1976 Summer Jobs in
B r i t a i n , 1976 Summer Jobs
Abroad, Jobs and Careers
Abroad, Travellers Survival
Kit Europe. These are a l l
available for reference in the
Welfare room on the top floor
of the Union B u i l d i n g , and on
a preliminary inspection
seem most useful. T h e 1976
J o b s available books are
broken down into areas, in this
country and abroad, and the
opportunities vary from fruit
and hop picking to milkmen.
T h e Travellers Survival K i t
E u r o p e " gives a great insight
into the countries of Europe,
telling you how to travel
cheaply, the most economical
accommodation, where to eat,
and where to find the best
nightlife. A n indispensable
book for the traveller. Longer
range job and career prospects
abroad are dealt with in
" J o b s and Careers A b r o a d " ,
which outlines job opportunities
in many countries and s o if
you are contemplating a career
abroad why not pop up and
consult this.
Self-Catering Halls?
Kitchen F e e ? -
The college refectories are
heading, if things continue as
at present, for another large
deficit at the end of this year.
After the forty percent increase
of last summer the takings
in refectories have only gone
up by eight per cent. I do
not feel that the solution that
will be adopted for this problem
is going to be another massive
price increase. So, what are
the alternatives?
There have been several
suggestions so far and the
first two of these are aimed
at increasing the refectories
fixed income. A " k i t c h e n f e e "
which would be paid by a l l
members of the college to
cover the refectories fixed
costs is a p o s s i b i l i t y . People
eating in the refectories
would then only have to pay
the cost of food. It is not
sure whether this fee would
be met by each students
L o c a l Authority, although I
personally doubt this. T h e
other possibility is to make
the Southside halls of residence
full or partial boarding. E a c h
resident would then have to
pay for a certain number of
meals a week and take those
meals in Southside Refectory.
The third suggestion that I
have heard is that we start
to c l o s e refectories and
concentrate on one or two
areas.
I shall be glad to receive
any comments on these suggested
alternatives.
Royal C o l l e g e of Art
Refectory
I have received a complaint
from the new President of the
R C A about the number gf IC
students using their Refectory
at ' luncht^me. Many of the
R C A students are fed up with
queueing for a long time
behind IC students. I have
been asked to remind you that
IC students should not use the
R C A Refectory before one
o ' c l o c k and must pay a 10p
surcharge. These two rules
are going to be enforced far
more strictly in the near
future. Y o u have been warned,
so don't come moaning if you
are thrown out of R C A at ten
to one.
New Hall of Residence
The ability to announce a
benefaction to enable an
extension to L i n s t e a d H a l l
to be built i s one of the
events of this year that
gave me great pleasure. It is
a marvellous gesture on the
part of one individual to see
that IC is able to fulfil i t s
purpose properly which it i s
feared it cannot without a
large proportion of students
in residence. I have written
to the anonomous benefactor
to express our thanks.
I hope that the building
work w i l l be able to start
q u i c k l y , though I would not
expect the new extension to
be habitable for at least
three years.

Letter
Dear Sir,
I would I ike to a s k those
who would disaffiliate to
consider tho position of
B ' i t i s h students should a l l
c o l l e g e s and coal m n e s ,
both distributed fairly randomly
around the country, both
having " s i m i l a r " union
structures and both striving for
the betterment of the bodies
they represent.
Now think back to the last
great coal strike and a s k
yourself; where does the
powar of this body lie? Is It
In individual action of local
mines or in consolidated action
of the National union? It i s
a simple step to compare
just how effective IC Union
on its own will be when
compared to the pressure our
national body c a n bring
upon our effective employer,
the Government.
Fo>' th3 Ti.jjority o ' students
at IC who need a simple
question, a s k yourself, " D p
you need a national represent-
ative body or n o t ? " . Questions
concerning C h i l e , A n g o l a and
so on are policy matters that
can be changed by sufficient
disapproval; do not destroy
the N U S over minoc political
matters.
Yours faithfully,
