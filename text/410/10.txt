F I R S T , T H E R E IS Peter Hain
accused of a bank robbery, then
there is Jeremy Thorpe accused
of a serious "error of judgment"
by the national media concerning
his venture into secondary
b a n k i n g . A l s o the smear
campaign conducted by the
media on behalf of some
w i l l a g e idiot who branded
Mr Thorpe a pout.
So, let us take a look at the
Liberal Party. Dog-food
gourmet Clement Freud and
everybodys favourite pumpkin
C y r i l Smith. Then there is
David Steel, John Pardoe and
D a v i d Penhaligon — Penhali
who?
How about the Lords?
Well, we all know about
Lord (Eric Lubbock) Avebury
and also Lord (lost all his
money) Beaumont. So what?
Credibility is what it's all
about, of course.
At the last two e l e c t i o n s ,
the Liberal Party announced
that it was now being taken
seriously by a large proportion
of the electorate — all that was
needed was a little faith.
Since then, one can only say
that the Party has steadily
gone downhill in popularity
and e s p e c i a l l y in the credibility
s t a k e s . Is the Liberal Party
anywhere near the stage of
leading the country back on
its feet again?
Y e s . And that is the answer
from the rank and file of
the Liberal Party. The tens
of thousands of active party
workers up and down the
country believe that there is
very much all to play for.
There are many, many loonies
in the other two parties, yet it
seems that there is truth
indeed in the old s a y i n g ,
Safety in Numbers.
The few Liberal M P s
stand alone under the awesome
banner of Liberalism - alone,
that i s , in Parliament, and
their stand is admirable
considering the odds against
making any impact at a l l .
Out in the country, the
m a s s e s rally to the party
c a l l . Never has support for
the Party leadership been
stronger than it is today.
When the other two parties
are attacked by the media,
they cringe and sulk. The
L i b e r a l s , however, take up
the challenge and strive
harder for justic, equality
and freedom for the individual.
The Liberal Party has
been mauled by the P r e s s and
T V like never before - but
far from being
fight has only
The Party is
leadership.
So beware Harold, beware
Maggie, the L i b e r a l s are
after your blood!
