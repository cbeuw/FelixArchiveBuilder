"We need criticism
Clarke fights back
N U S P R E S I D E N T , C h a r l e s
C l a r k e , yesterday replied to
increasing criticism of the
N U S , in a speech at E s s e x
U n i v e r s i t y .
Speaking to a Union General
Meeting there, he stated h i s
belief that the disenchantment
with N U S was based on two
ideas: that the p o l i t i c a l
d e c i s i o n s of governments and
Parliament have no real effect
upon students and that even
if they d i d , the N U S could
have no real influence over
the d e c i s i o n s .
"Bui", he said, "students
are not immune from the
economic , position which
affects all of us." He outlined
the effects of the present
economic c r i s i s on the education
sector in particular. T h e
closure of teacher-training
c o l l e g e s , the cutting back of
discretionary grants by local
authorities and the closure
of nnili-r-siibscribed c o u r s e s ,
he thought were a l l a direct
result of the Government's
decision to reduce public
spending.
But this w a s not the only
way in which students were
affected. On a more personal
level, the prospects for
employment were grim. T h e
number of " t r a d i t i o n a l " jobs
available i s l e s s than the
number of graduates seeking
them, according to the " S t a n d i n g
Conference of U n i v e r s i t y
Appointment S e r v i c e s " . A l s o ,
at present, there i s a surplus
of 8000 qualified teachers.
Undergraduates are not

problems because up to 50%
of parents are not paying
their full contribution toward
the grant. A l l these things, he
s a i d , affected students directly,
particularly those who will be
looking for jobs within the
public sector. Any belief
that students were economically
isolated was a "dangerous
i l l u s i o n " , whether the college
was a "further education
college in an industrial city,
or one of our beautiful ivory
academic tower* of i s o l a t i o n . "
Mr C l a r k e then went
on to defend the record
• o f the N U S in affecting
educational p o l i c i e s . l i e
cited the stand of N U S ,on
social security payments for
students during vacations and
also mentioned overseas
students. " F o r overseas
students the worst possible
thing now is a weakening of
the national union.", he
warned.
He claimed the " R e g i s t r a t i o n
S c h e m e " , dealing with proposals
on student housing was
withdrawn s o l e l y at the
instigation of the N U S . T h e
National Union had put forward
and fought for the present
grant system which was intro-
duced in 1962, and h a s been
fighting for i t s improvement
ever since: bitterly opposing
the " l o a n s y s t e m " which
e x i s t s in many other W European
countries.
In 1972, the N U S stopped
a change in the financing of
Student U n i o n s , in 1973 a
mid-year review of grants was
forced.
These s u c c e s s e s , he felt,
came from the unity of the
N U S . He deplored "its failure
to successfully communicate its
policies and activities to all
its members. We need criticism
in order to improve. But that
criticism must come from
within the movement". Student
Unions which disaffiliated
made themselves "more
vulnerable to the wolves in
the blizzard."
Charles Clarke w i l l be at
IC on 19 February, when he
will participate in a debate
on disaffiliation together with
Ian M i n n i s , President of A s t o n
University G u i l d of Students.

L A S T S A T U R D A Y evening a
postgraduate student at I C
had a brush with the L a w .
It i s a l l e g e d , that after
leaving a party in Wandsworth,
he ran out of a chip shop
without paying. He was
apprehended by a p a s s i n g squad
car. The police claim that,
while resisting arrest, he hit
them three times; outside the
shop, in the p o l i c e car and
while entering the station.
The student claims that he
only retaliated after provocation
each time a n d , that whilst in
the c a r , he w a s hit with a
torch.
After being arrested he
was j a i l e d on Saturday evening
and w a s only released on
Sunday evening, after finding
£100 b a i l .
