IC is a cliquish college
P R O F I L E : Riz Shakir
B O R N IN the P u n j a b , R i z Shakir
eventually arrived in England at the
age of 13 after having lived in various
countries from the far east to the far
west to join h i s parents. He came to
IC f r o m a sixth form c o l l e g e in
L e i c e s t e r s h i r e . The school is s t i l l
recovering from the reverberations of
the revolutionary wind of change which
swept'it during R i z ' s presence.
It is with the same energy and gusto,
that he has approached his job as
Deputy President of Imperial C o l l e g e
U n i o n . Being a surprise candidate at
the election, he was something of an
unknown quantity. However, he has
s i n c e proved to quite a few people,
including his department, that he can
cope with the job and do it adequately
whilst simultaneously pursuing a degree
in Chemistry.
He himself says of the job: " / think
I have lived up to what I intended to do,
but there's a lot more I'd like to do".
The job of D P is one of the most difficult
in the Union to carry out, he s a y s . A
sabbatical D P would be useful although
a restructuring of the U n i o n and
redefinition of the job description would
first be required.
The extent to which students relate
to the Union is minimal and this, he
s a y s , is because it has been allowed
to become a political stepping stone
(with the exception of this year, of
course). Another contributory factor is
that the sabbatical officers are so
overloaded with work that they are
unable to go out and meet with the
students they represent. "A situation
has been reached where ICU is regarded
solely as a political entity rather than
a social and cultural one as well, which
in fact it is", he s a y s .
"IC could retain its reputation by
producing graduates with good degrees
and without dehumanising them in the
p r o c e s s " .
IC students are apathetic, not because
they wish to be, but because the system
forces them to be s o . F a r too much
emphasis is put into keeping up the
C o l l e g e ' s academic reputation. T h i s
demands that IC students be put through
intensive c o u r s e s , which are not only
boring, but deny them the opportunity
to broaden their education — he stated
this, meaning that IC turns out computer
like people instead of educated human
beings.
"IC could retain its reputation by
producing graduates with good degrees
and without dehumanising them in the
process".
He is worried that very little is
being done to make courses interesting
and he knows of many c a s e s in which
students have had to be persuaded to
continue with their c o u r s e s . "Little or
no consideration is given to the varying
interests of students which might other-
wise give them the stimulus to continue
with their courses". Courses, he feels,
are structured very impersonally and
without much thought for the student
taking the degree.
T h i s impersonal atmosphere bred the
c l i q u e s which permeate the C o l l e g e ;
a result of students spending too much
timr- in the company of only those
students in their own course. "IC is a
cliquish college , ne says in a damning
tone. "If you don't form a clique, then
you're out".
Overseas students are a particular
example of this phenomena of clique
forming." They come out of their countries,
more often than not from a different
culture, and are made to feel ill at home".
The alien c u l t u r e , language and
embarassment over their spoken E n g l i s h
forces them to form c l i q u e s of their own
countrymen — a situation which leads to
very little or no racial integration.
"This is totally at odds with IC's
reputation as an international centre of
learning".
He takes a principled stand against
the proposed increases in the fees of
overseas students because, he says,
many of them come from poor countries.
He does not expect them to take a stand
against the fees increase, lest they
are deported.
"We have to stand up and help these
people — people, who like us, would
like knowledge, but are not being given
the same opportunities to learn — just as
we would stand up for our own grants to
be raised, we must campaign on their
behalf after due consultation with them".
Moreover, he s t r e s s e s that the problem
is a humanitarian rather than a political
one and should be seen as s u c h .
"ICWA, although not perfect, is at
the moment, an essential part of the
U n i o n . . . "
The problems of overseas students
at IC are c l o s e l y linked with those of
the postgraduate students of whom
50% are from o v e r s e a s . R i z agrees
with the Rector, Sir Brian F l o w e r s , that
the Union does not cater adequately
for P G s . "However, the question of
how to get PGs more involved in the
Union is a much more difficult one",
he s a y s .
There are two main areas in which
he sees p o s s i b l e solutions developing.
The lack of involvement amongst P G s is
exacerbated by the very small laboratory
units into which they are split. One
way to bring them together is for the
C o l l e g e to organise more associated
studies lectures, (which they are given
credit for), s p e c i f i c a l l y for P G s thus
aiding integration and s o c i a l i s i n g . T h i s ,
he feels, would provide a b a s i s for unity
among P G s .
"The Union itself should try and
organise a lot more events for PGs".
If the Union should find itself at a
loss as to the type and kind of functions
it should organise, then it could try
finding out through those P G s who
are already active in the U n i o n . He
also does not think that there is sufficient
provision for married students (many are
P G s ) in C o l l e g e owned accommodation.
Another group of IC students whom
he feels, are similarly hard done by are
the women "ICWA, although not perfect,
is at the moment, an essential part of
the Union and will develope a lot more
in the future years". It is a healthy
sign, he s a y s , to see d i s c u s s i o n being
instigated within ICWA on a wide
variety of topics affecting women.
"It seems IC is either go and swot in
the library or go to the bar and drink
yourself s i l l y . . . "
However, the attitudes in the C o l l e g e ,
s o c i a l l y and academically, he s a y s , do
not take women's presence into account.
"In many cases women are regarded as
Riz Shakir
people who have lost their way into a
course". A poor state of affairs con-
sidering we want more women at I C .
"The social structure has to be
changed radically before the male to
female ratio can begin to improve.
At the moment the social structure is
very much based on a drinking man's
club — most of the social functions
involve drinking. It seems IC is either
go and swot in the library or go to
the bar and drink yourself silly... Firstly,
there shouldn't be so much academic
pressure on people as is the case at
the moment... Secondly, we have to
change social functions from principally
drinking to s o c i a l i s i n g and drinking'.
Too much emphasis is put on drink in
his thinking.
" N U S at the moment does very little
for students"
H i s most outspoken comments w e r e /
however, those regarding the National
Union. On the question of representation,
he states categorically that, "It (the
NUS) doesn't represent anybody but the
few political activists that are at the top
or are in the pipeline to replace them in
turn. It is very much a political stepping
stone for opportunist students, that is
all. It does not represent a damn student
and the opinions that it puts forward are
very often those that suit them".
"NUS at the moment does very little
for students".
That a national organisation represent-
ing students is a great a s s e t , he agrees;
however, his image of such a body is
very different to that of N U S at the
moment. He does not think that N U S
should be a p o l i t i c a l l y motivated body
and it should restrict its area of concern
to those issues directly affecting students.
If, in any such i s s u e s , p o l i t i c s is involved,
then fair enough, but otherwise strictly
no p o l i t i c s . International issues are
also out, in his opinion, as regards
campaigning work although we should
d i s c u s s and adopt p o l i c y on them.
Whilst he thought it extremely u s e f u l ,
at a local level, to l i a i s e with trade
unions, he was against the ' p o l i t i c a l
grovelling' of the N U S executive to the
T U C .
Despite these attitudes to the National
Union, he i s , in principle, opposed to
d i s a f f i l i a t i o n .
