Union Hall Places in Jeopardy
A meeting of the ICU PWP on
Monday, discussed plans to
abolish all union places in hall.
This included withdrawal of the
automatic allocation of a place for
sabbatical officers, though aftei a
long discussion, it was generally
agreed that the Deputy President
was-
" the only person who
warranted a room in hall. Letters
are to be sent out to all current
holders of union-allocated rooms,
asking them to justify why their
successors should have a place in
hall. The next PWP meeting will
analyze the replies and will decide
whether to put a motion to the
next UGM on the subject.

Disappointing Turnout for DES
Picket
Only one hundred people
turned out for last Friday's picket
of the DES and fifteen of them
were from IC. The protest was
abandoned after a few speeches
and slogan chants, only an hour
after it started. The protest was
against the current DES attitude
to overseas students and against
the 32% increase in their fees this
