T H E H I T C H H I K E R S GUIDE
T O T H E G A L A X Y
This is a long awaited book, by me and
every otr 5
r fan of the immensely popular (the
book cover says famous) Radio Four series of
the same name. The book is based on the
series, which was first broadcast in March
1978 and has since had two repeats. It covers
the first four episodes, but with minor
differences throughout - the plot diverging
significantly at the end.
For non-initiates into such mysteries as
Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters and the
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, the story
starts at the West Country home of Arthur
Dent (a local radio employee), which is just
about to be demolished to make way for a by-
pass. When the earth is subsequently
destroyed by the Vogons to make way for a
new hyperspace by-pass Arthur and his
friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be from
a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
and not from Guildford after all. hitch a lift
with the Vogons' cooks. The book follows the
highly improbable events ofthe next few days
in the course of which Arthus and Ford are
rescued from certain death by an
experiment?! ship with the new Infinite
Improbability Drive, crewed by Zaphod
Beeblebrox - the three-armed, two-headed,
renegade Galactic President, Trilliam - a girl
Arthur once completely failed to get off with
at a party in Islington, and the intensively
depressive and (depressing) robot Marvin -
nicknamed by the humans 'the Paranoid
Android'. The next day they reach the
legendary Magrathea, home of luxury planet
builders and, after escaping certain death,
meet Slartibartfast, who gives them some
important information concerning earth
history. The story continues and before long
they are facing certain death again. At this
point the book differs from the radio series
and they are not blasted through time to the
Restaurant at the End of the Universe. To find
out what happens you will have to buy the
book
The book is highly enjoyable throughout,
this being in no small part due to the frequent
inclusion of passages from the electronic
book, "The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy'
for which Ford is a field researcher, and
which, as he says, tells you everything you
need to know about everything from towel to
God to small furry creatures from Alpha
Centauri. The book retains the ironical
humour of the series with equal success
although, on the whole, I preferred it on the
radio. Even so the book is definitely worth
going*without two pints for tonight, so you
can afford it.
