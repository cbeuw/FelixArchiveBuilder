Dear Sir,
The presidents of the C C U s were
quite correct in their assumption
that freshers will have formed
their own opinions of the C C U s , I
am a fresher and I have.
I sat through the absurdity of the
R C S U meeting on Oct 1st,
observing antics more often seen
in second-rate comedy shows,
culminating in a mock trial which
took place because the president
was not wearing the presidential
underwear! The occasion seemed
not to be democratic, but chaotic,
a platform from which any ham-
actor can boost an elephantine
ego to Olympian heights. More
seriously, we were asked to vote
representatives into union posts,
which were ill-defined, without
knowing anything about the
candidates, which is surely
against the spirit of democracy.
Another point the presidents
raised, was that all the first week's
activities were well attended,
which was true, since they were a
n e w p h e n o m e n a t o m a n y
freshers. Yet to me, there seemed
to be a credibility gap between the
incoherent inebriates I saw at the
R C S U bar night and supposedly
responsible union officials. The
entire evening was devoted to the
belief that to drink to excess and
mouth obscenities is the pinacle
of joy, which the R C S U officials
must believe, since they arrange
everything.
The many good points the.
presidents did mention can easily
be tackled by a reformed body
and so cannot be an argument in
their defence.
But my most basic criticism is
that the system forms a self-
perpetuating clique, while many
of B r i t i a n ' s q u a i n t l i t t l e
anachronisms, glorious at a
distance, but when viewed closely
reveals its decadence and decay.
It is time this 'spoilt infant' was
brought kicking and screaming
into the economic and social
realities of 1979.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
During Tuesday's U G M , I was
amazed to find that despite heated
discussion on two controversial
notions, the only breach of the
peace was committed by our
President, Chris Fox. M r Fox flew
into a tantrum at the sight of some
union members leaving before the
debate on occupation and let
forth a tirade of incoherent abuse
and foul language. His anger and
frustration were understandable,
but his behaviour was disgusting
and reprehensible.
Yours sincerely,
L. Hunt
Dear Editor,
Wandering down Queen's Gate
Terrace (you know, the road
between mathematics and the
Queen's), I noticed a sign tied to a
parking meter which said: "People
dumping rubbish here are liable to
persecution." Is this a new word
for 'attention by the law'?
L G Kirby
Sir,
T h e letters f r o m M i c h a e l
O'Connor and Frank James got
stuck on my shit filter as I read
FELIX last week, so I felt I had to
reply to them.
M r O ' C o n n o r ' s "intelligent,
responsible and socially aware
behaviour" already occurs, or is
supposed to, within ICU. ICU
U G M s are also incredibly boring,
but fortunately, attendance is
optional. You don't have to go to
C C U U G M s either.
I would consider anybody to be
lacking in "social development" if
they were unable to let their hair
down in some way. Guilds people
have plenty of work to do, and
between lectures, tutorials, labs
and so on,.many like to relax in
an energetic fashion. Nobody has
to go to a Guilds U G M , but people
do, throughout the year, and I for
one don't feel in the least
degraded. (I don't go to Morphy
day.) Y o u say that this kind of
behaviour must sour the public
against students; surely it is better
for us to play in Mech E n g 220
than at home or in the street,
where the public can in fact S E E
us?
The C C U s A R E a "centre for
organizing action", some of it on
a c a d e m i c affairs, f r e s h e r s '
dinners, etc., but an awful lot on
Rag. If you have any doubts about
the beneficial effect on Rag of
internecine C C U rivalry, consider
two matters:
1. The amount of extra money
often collected just to beat
another C C U ' s total.
2. A s a commercial parallel, the
steamroller success of General
M o t o r s ' v a r i o u s c o m p e t i n g
divisions.
As for the strange game played
with coins: I thought it a bit odd
too. But can you honestly carp
about the waste of time? Have you
never sat in front of a television
when you didn't have to, or had
five minutes' extra morning
snooze for the hell of it?
Mr James: y o u strike me as a
puritan, a bore or both. Did you
really think that your abolition
was suggested seriously? Your
total lack of humour demon-
strates how pathetic these ICU
people are....
I think that you are doing more to
enforce conformity than any
number of beer-swilling latent
homosexuals (personally, I prefer
Scotch, beautiful cars and fast
women). A C C U is an expression
of individuality and enterprise
(not to mention insanity) to which
it's great to feel you belong (to
'borrow' a slogan). Before coming
up to IC, I experienced a broad
range of social situations, from
discussions on nuclear energy at
2am to learning to dance (while
i n e b r i a t e d ) at a r o c k a b i l l y
concert. When I came here, I
chose Guilds as my social
medium - all by myself. It did
involve thought; it did not involve
coercion.
You suggest that C C U s should
exist solely for sports and
academic affairs. Surely this
would make them automatically
superfluous, as sports have their
own hierarchy, and academic
a f f a i r s a l r e a d y h a v e I C U
committees. Megalomania is alive
and well and living in South
Kensington!
Your postscript seems to betray
a somewhat smug and childish
a t t i t u d e : s o m e w h a t a n t i -
i n t e l l e c t u a l , I w o u l d s a y .
This has been rather a long letter,
but my blood boils no longer. You
may note that I can write words of
more than one syllable, and that I
c o n s i d e r " a b o v e a v e r a g e
intelligence" to be an insulting
understatement for a number of
people at IC.
Yours faithfully,
Kenneth R Strachan
Dear Sir,
Last term I voted for Chris Fox
because he campaigned for a
balanced Union. Yet in his
support for the occupation he has
shown a complete lack of balance.
He has failed to balance idealism
and realism. He has failed to
balance ideals with what the
country can afford. He has failed
to balance aspirations with what
can be acheived. He has failed to
balance the authority of the
National Government elected by a
huge majority with the close result
of the last UGM and his lack of
overwhelming support, (the first
count, on the 3rd amendment,
before 2 . 3 0 p m . , s h o w e d a
difference of less than 15 with
more than 400 votes cast). He
expects the Government to
reverse their p o l i c i e s when
Cabinet Ministers spent most of
last week saying that they would
never do such a thing.
B y failing to b a l a n c e the
disadvantages of an antagonistic
destructive approach with the
a d v a n t a g e s of a d o p t i n g a
constructive attitude, and by
putting his politics before the
interests of those who elected him
he has shown that he himself has
found it easy to do a U-turn.
Indeed, our President, has
become totally unbalanced.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Wormsley (Maths II)
DEBATING
SOCIETY
The Debating Society held its freshers'
debate on Thurday, 11th October, tt was
decided that it should take the form of a
balloon debate. Each speaker was to speak
for three minutes on his chosen character,
explaining why he should not be ejected from
the imaginary sinking balloon.
First was Nick Ajderian, who spoke as
himself, a tolerance engineer. Next Richard
Kicks spoke as Tony Benn, explaining that he
believed in free speech, as long as you agreed
with him. Adrian Black also spoke as himself,
explaining that he was the lightest. Next was
Mark Jeffcock, who spoke as Eugene
Ferdinad, commander of Apollo 17, the last
man on the moon. Then Jonathan Briggs,
doing an excellent 'kissy-kissy' spoke as Miss
Piggy. There followed John Murphy as a
pregnant Elkie Brooks. Tom Owen spoke as
Martin Luther King, claiming he should be
saved in order to be assassinated. Philip
Greenstreet claimed to be that great Victorian
social reformer, Jack the Ripper, Finally, Ken
M a n n s p o k e as D o c t o r C r i p p i n .
Questions and comments then came from
the floor, such as the morbid observation that
a pregnanat Elkie Brooks could not stay
aboard the balloon since, strictly speaking
the rules only allowed one person to remain.
Finally a vote was taken, and Ken Mann was
the winner, thus becoming eligible to drink
from the freshers debating pot in the Union
Bar.
If anyone out there would like to attend
debates or help with the society generally,
scour FELIX for our notices and look for our
posters.
COMMUNITY
ACTION
GROUP
TASK FORCE
There are over 10,000 old people living
alone in Kensington, many of whom never go
out and have very few visitors. Some of them
do not claim (or even know about) the
benefits that they are entitled to, such as
'meals on wheels' and home helps and others
regard these as 'taking charity' and would
rather starve to death. They may be
persuaded to stay alive if their life was made
worth living. Volunteers are needed to visit
them regularly, to talk to them, to take them
for walks {in a wheelchair if necessary), and
to make sure that they are claiming enough to
live on.
There are some pensioners who are being
turned into vegetables by the institutional
attitudes and staff shortages in some old
people's homes. Some are literally dying of
boredom and others are going senile. This
could be prevented by volunteers visiting
them, and keeping the old people alive
(mentally at least). Those who have always
led full and active lives can not stand the
thought that they are now useless, and lose
the will to live when they start losing their
faculties.
If you would like to help these people,
please contact:
John Whitehouse (ICU office or ICCAG
room),
Surila Nimalasuriya (Maths 2)
Simon Chandler (Red Cross Members'Group
leader, Maths) or anyone wearing an ICCAG
badge.
We also do work with more active
pensioners such as taking dogs for walks,
taking people to the seaside (in the summer),
digging gardens for people who can manage
all right otherwise, etc. ICCAG alos works
with young people, children, anyone else in
need - tell us if you know of anyone. Come to
our room at the top of the Union Building any
lunchtime and John Whitehouse will give you
a cup of coffee.
Soup runs as usual - Tuesday and Friday at
10:30pm. in Falmouth Hall kitchen
