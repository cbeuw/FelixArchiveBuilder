Dear Colin,
We would just like to correct
some facts wrongly written in last
week's FELIX, under Malcolm
Brain's article.
Surely, the purpose of a duty
officer is to ensure that there is no
trouble in the bar and when there
is (and not before!) correct the
situation. It is also the duty
officer's responsibility to assist
the head barman in any way
possible.
It is not their duty to effect
trouble (perhaps by calling the
police) when no trouble has been
caused.
We would also like to point out
that the e x - R S M U member quoted
in the article did N O T make any
comment in verbal form to the
duty officer that evening. Thus an
ordinary citizen of the street, as a
guest of an IC student was thrown
out of the bar for no reason at all.
A duty officer must have the
tolerance and integrity to handle a
situation - let alone handle one's
own emotions.
The question of abuse on that
particular evening is grossly
exaggerated, in fact invented.
' T h e final incorrect point comes
in the first paragraph of this topic,
whereby, it states that the "match
having been arranged mainly by
R S M U . " Since no union money
was spent on the arrangements
a n d that n o n - s t u d e n t s also
assisted in these, we don't think it
is right to quote R S M U as the
organizers.
Yours sincerely,
R S M U Exec C o m m
Dear Colin,
Your letters page is probably not
the best place to air my views on
the Rag Mag, but I feel I must reply
to last week's letter, which grossly
m i s r e p r e s e n t s t h e f a c t s .
Firstly, I protest strongly to the
label "blatantly sexist" - I have
studied it thoroughly and can find
n o t h i n g w h i c h d i s c r i m i n a t e s
against either sex - except
possibly the cross-word, which I
suppose could be described as
'degrading' to men. (Indeed Justin
Newland's incredible story last
week was a thousand times more
sexist.)
As for it being racist, here are the
facts: it contains one 'Rastus' joke,
mentions the word 'wog' once,
and has a series of lightheaded
jokes - eight Jewish (not including
the Volkswagen' joke, which I'll
mention later), nine Irish jokes
and one Scots - not to mention
several aimed at the English.
Please let me stress that these are
Jokes a n d I doubt if the Irish
a m o n g u s w o u l d l a b e l us
"bigoted" for such fun-poking.
This is far less racist than the
average Rag Mag.
However, on the sick jokes, I
agree, they are depraved, very
sick and I personally find them
totally unfunny (though many
disagree oh this). What's more
s e v e r a l ( t h e 'Volkswagen',
Moorgate and Aberfan jokes in
particular) are offensive, and
Chris, Malcolm and I did all in our
power to stop them being
included.
Unfortunately, we failed, which
is why we dissociated ourselves -
so that all complaints etc. should
go to the person responsible -
Steve Marshall.
I certainly have never made the
excuse "....that by the time I
realized what was happening it
was too late." - perhaps if the
writers of last week's letter had
tried to find out the facts of the
case, they wouldn't have made
such mistakes.
A far greater error, however, is to
state that "....such an obviously
talented person as M r Marshall
should have produced a Rag Mag
without foreseeing the obvious
consequences." I agree he has
talent - one only has to glance at
the layout of this Mag, or the R C S
Handbook to see that, but he most
certainly did foresee, if not
actually encourage the "obvious
consequences", as throughout
production he took the attitude,
firstly, that he was the Editor and
not even ICU Exec had the right to
curtail hs editorial freedom and
secondly, that this Rag M a g
should be as depraved and
obscene as he could make it
w i t h o u t it a c t u a l l y b e i n g
prosecutable.
Also, just for the record, I did
consider acting to stop it being
printed, but felt I hadn't the power
to do so, without consulting at
least my committee, if not a U G M .
Perhaps this is a fault of mine that
I would try to represent the views
of those who elected me, as
opposed to those who simply use
their posts to give power to their
o w n p e r s o n a l o p i n i o n s . . . .
Rachel Snee (NOT Ms!)
Rag Chairman
PS - A s we have so far been
concerned with the bad points of
the Mag, may I also put forward
the good: it is superbly laid out,
e x c e l l e n t l y printed, c o n t a i n s
many very funny jokes and some
of the best cartoons I've seen.
Many consider it easily the best
Rag M a g they've ever read.
Dear Sir,
I know that this is the permissive
age, and I consider myself to be
fairly broadminded, but there are
limits! I am of course referring to
the R a g Mag. Apart from the
crossword, which is blatantly
obscene, there are some jokes
which are somewhat offensive
also. O n e which particularly
comes to mind is the one referring
to the number of Jews that can get
into a Volkswagen. Any, indeed
every Jew has the absolute right
to be deeply offended by such a
'joke', and for that matter, so has
the Volkswagen car company.
I realize that the staple diet of
Rag Mag humour is sex, and the
type of remarks that comment on
the intelligence of the Irish etc.,
but some level of decency must be
m a i n t a i n e d . If not, then it
d e g e n e r a t e s from b e i n g a
humorous publication into one of
unmitigated filth and as such
damage the reputation of the
College.
In his editorial, Steve Marshall
says: "I have attempted to
produce a Rag Mag that is actually
different to A L L others." In this
respect, he has most certainly
succeeded, as I am sure that there
is not a great many Rag Mags that
have been refused by a publisher
on grounds of obscenity, and has
been disowned by the President,
D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t a n d R a g
Chairperson of its own College
Union!
I therefore thoroughly endorse
the views of Aftab Gujral et al
(FELIX, 12 Oct).

Dear Sir,
I think it is time that several
Union officers spent more time
worrying about matters of direct
concern to the majority of
students ie, accommodation and
college catering, rather than
w o r r y i n g t h e m s e l v e s a b o u t
foreign students' fees.
I would like to draw your
attention to some facts about
f o r e i g n s t u d e n t s f e e s , as
published in the 'Financial Times'
of 10 A u g . T h e government
currently spends £100million on
subsidies for foreign students. It
must be considered wrong that
60% of the average unit cost of a
foreigners further education is
met b y t h e U K t a x p a y e r .
The increase of 77% for 1977/78
and the proposed increase of 33%
this autumn still doesn't go far
enough. In order for a foreign
undergraduate to pay the full cost
of his education a further 25%
increase is required to bring the
fees up to the true cost of £2,350.
This year government cuts
require £200million to be trimmed
off education expenditure. What
better way of doing this than to
reduce the current £100million
subsidy.
About 60% of foreign students
come from countries who could
easily afford the large suggested
increase in fees. This increase
need not necessarily reduce the
number of foreign students,
which currently stands at 82,000.
I do not wish to prevent students
f r o m p o o r c o u n t r i e s f r o m
studying here, but I think that
countries such as the rich o i l -
producing Arab countries, w h o
don't know what to do with all
their money, should pay a realistic
price rather than expect the
British to subsidize them. I am
proposing a 'means test' to be
applied to their native country. Do
people not realize that the
£100million government subsidy
does not come out of a bottomless
pit, but out of everybody's pocket.
Yours sincerely,
J C Pearson
Dear Sir,
Though the recent U G M was my
first, I feel it necessary to
comment on the way in which the
occupation motion was passed.
The supporters of the motion,
were obviously expecting to take
part in the occupation that
afternoon, already prepared
themselves to miss all lectures
until further notice. The opposers
however, as the sit-in would not
directly involve them, felt they
could not afford to miss their
lectures. Thus as the actual vote
was taken after 2:30pm, the
majority of the people remaining
in the hall were those supporting
the m o t i o n . T h e r e f o r e t h e
resulting vote cannot be said to be
a true representation of the
feelings of IC students
I would also suggest that the
union exec were too concerned in
being the first union to take any
sort of positive action and let their
impatience take priority overafair
debate and vote.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Colin,
We feel that after this letter,
Justin Newland will strike us as a
very articulated young man.
However, with reverence to his
article in FELIX 529, and indeed in
the words of Philip Bliss (1838-
1876), viz., "Hold the fort, for I am
coming," might one not waiver in
t h e j u x t a p o s i t i o n o f s u c h
r e l e n t l e s s v e r b o s i t y w i t h a
s i m p l i s t i c a n d l i n g u i s t i c a l l y
unadventurous discourse o n the
antics and animadversions of
those catalytic young freshers?
Indeed, was Beaujolais some
psychic predecessor of the
concpiscent Anne? Is Justin
Newland merely a gnome de
plume for some semantically
mercurial messenger with corn of
plenty?
