Fourteen month old Jerome lay in the hospital
cot, almost lifeless, dressed only in a napkin with the
fan playing on his hot little body. He'd been like that
for a couple of days - would the drugs work? We sat
anxiously watching him for any sign of real life.
He'd caught meningitis and we had rushed tiim
the twenty miles to Truro Hospital. "We'll have to
make some tests to see what is causing the pain - it
could be meningitis. If it is, we need to know the
virus," the house doctor informed us.
Tests confirmed meningitis, and the next day the
virus was known too. We were told that the
treatment may have some side effects but the
alternative - alternative? - was likely to be death.
Gradually he showed signs of life, but what we
remember most were his eyes; dull, lifeless and
unseeing, so unlike the sparkling eyes of our baby,
but even they came back to life again and soon he
was home again - almost as good as new, except
that he was deaf!
We didn't learn that he was deaf though for a few
months, as he didn't learn to talk or respond to a call.
At four and three-quarters he went to a partially
hearing unit in a school at Honiton, twenty-five
miles from our new home on the edge of Dartmoor,
unable to hear properly and unable to speak. The
devoted attention from the staff of the partially
hearing unit together eith the NHS hearing aids
worked wonders. Soon he was talking so that at
least we could understand him, even if strangers
couldn't until they became 'tuned-in' to his strange
intonation.
Jerome and most of his eleven friends atthe PHU,
although with differing degrees of deafness, were
blessed with the ability to learn. So with sheer hard
work from the staff, not to mention from mums and
dads coping with homework most nights, they have
maintained a high academic standard at the primary
level, and probably more important, they can mix
without embarrassment with children their own age.
But the deaf world is very demanding and Jerome
began to become conscious of his body-worn
hearing aids. He would cover them over in public, so
they couldn't be seen - and so cut down their ability
to pick up sounds, indeed they picked up the sound
of coats and pullovers rubbing together. The danger
signs of withdrawal into the deaf world were
showing.
It was at this stage that the phonic ear made its
presence felt in Devon. One little girl's life was

transformed by her ability suddenly to hear with the
aid of a phonic ear. This piece of gadgetry is a radio
receiver/hearing aid worn by the child, tuned into a
radio transmitter worn by a teacher or whoever.
Teacher can be up to a hundred yards away, while
those who are talking face to face with the aid-
wearer can still be heard with the hearing aid part.
The key to its success is that it amplifies
magnificently, but will not amplify beyond a certain
level, those frequencies that could harm any
residual hearing that may be.
The phonic ear seemed to be an answer to the
problem of teaching beyond primary school age. A
willing teacher wearing a microphone could talk
whilst writing on the board and still be heard by the
deaf child. But at £750plus each, Devon Education
Authority couldn't see their way to buying them.
Over a period of a year Rotary Lions and other
groups of generous local people provided the
youngsters with a phonic ear each, for school use.
Their rate of learning increased appreciably. While
strain on the teachers decreased. Outings were no
longer a nightmare for the staff and more were
arranged, even to London.
There was one major drawback however, the
built-in rechargeable batteries would last during the
school day, so in the evenings and over the
weekends it was back to the good, but inferior,
ordinary body-worn aids - and the growing
embarrassment with them.
One or two youngsters were even provided with
their personal Phonic Ear for home use, and it was at
this time, in March 1979, that RCS stepped in and
held-up' and busked their way to the £750 for
Jerome's phonic ear.
What a difference that has made! From the
elementary language he has been using he now has
started speaking 'colloquially' (as the euphemism
has it). Mum can call him from another room without
having to rush around and find him, while a device
enables him to listen to the television without the
rest of us being deafened. But the greatest
advantage is that he is no longer embarrassed by the
receiver on his chest - on the contrary he is proud of
it! So now we have a more confident, happy boy and
the withdrawal has been reversed.
Oh yes, he has a speaking part, albeit small, in the
local amateur dramatic society production of the
'Caucasion Chalk Circle'. "Be quiet will you, I'm
learning my lines."
