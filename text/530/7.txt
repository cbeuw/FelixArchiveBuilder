THREE'S A PROBLEM
Mistakes abound in both the bidding and
play of hands in contract bridge. These lead
to many intriguing results. The bidding on the
folowing hand from a duplicate, at love all and
North as dealer, is given below:

East's bid was tentative while South's
showed a limit raise. The defence evaporated
on the lead of the eight of diamonds, which
was taken by the queen. After a heart to the
ace followed by three more rounds of trumps
East had discarded three spades. The ace of
diamonds was cashed and the defence
thrown in with a club. West won with the jack,
cashed and the defence thrown in with a club.
West won with the jack, cashed with A K and
led the three of spades. Declarer read East for
at least A J of spades and inserted the king, so
coming to nine tricks.
West started the post-mortem by asking
what had happened to the defence's six
tricks. East looked at the travelling score
sheet and commented that this would not
beat two spades or three diamonds. One N/S
pair had doubled three diamonds!
If you were West would you double three
hearts?
