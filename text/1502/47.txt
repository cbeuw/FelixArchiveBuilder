The current squad
is in great shape

build on last year’s
achievements
Sport Editor
I hope that the avid Sport readers (you
know who you are) have been enjoying
the Captains’ Interviews series – be-
cause we’ve decided to go weekly on
you. After having the Rugby first XV
captain last week, we turn to an equally
popular (and equally gruelling) sport.
Live from the Boathouse in Putney,
Rowing Club Captain Patrick Hudson
answers my questions.
I have always been slightly in awe
of rowers, with their steely, up-at-the-
crack-of-dawn training ethos and their
sheer drive for success. Somewhat in-
evitably, the first question I ask Patrick
revolves around this: where does he
find the motiviation to get up at such
scarily hours to train?
“I don’t know where the motivation
comes from...Possibly the fact that I
live at the Boathouse and my crew will
bang on my door to get up?” Ah, it’s all
about location then? Not quite, he says:
“Seriously though, it’s a rewarding
sport and we do everything we can to
win – anything less wouldn’t be good
enough.” Impressive stuff.
My next question is about the Boat
Club itself. Historically, it is one of Im-
perial’s strongest sporting outfits, with
the Putney Boathouse a testament to
that fact. What is the level of the cur-
rent senior squad? How has the club
fared in recent years?
Patrick proudly admits that “last sea-
son saw our best performance in the
last few years”:
“A 4th place out of 300 for the girls
at Women’s Eights Head of the River;
winners of the University Pennant and
four crews in the top 25 out of 400
at the Men’s Eights Head – no club
matched that achievement, student
or otherwise. Those successes were
followed by wins and strong perfor-
mances at the Henley Regattas in the
summer. The current squad is in great
shape and looks set to build on last
year’s achievements.”
I ask him to elaborate further; what
are the main objectives for this season?
“The most prestigious events for us
are the Eight’s Head races in March,
then Henley Royal Regatta and Hen-
ley Women’s Regatta in the summer.
Building the fastest possible crews to
compete and win at these regattas is
our focus.” What about BUCS points?
“BUCS is good fun,” he says, “and
we’ll put in a strong performance to
do our bit for the uni, but it’s not our
ultimate goal.” Sport Imperial do have
some lofty objectives for this season,
but I feel that Patrick and the boat club
will deliver – his hunger for winning is
unmistakeable.
Moving on to something slightly dif-
ferent, I ask about an association that a
lot of people make in their minds: the
one between rowing and the Olympics.
It’s a very exciting time for any sports-
man-or-woman to be in London; will
any Imperial rowers be involved in the
Games?
“Mel Wilson from Imperial is in the
Women’s Quadruple Sculls and Adam
Freeman-Pask, an alumnus who still
rows with us, is also in the frame for
a seat. Both Mel and Adam competed
at the World Championships this year.”
After my noises of wonder and excite-
ment subside, Patrick continues: “A
few club members are volunteering at
Dorney Lake and for the rest of us, or
those lucky enough to get tickets, we’ll
be cheering for GB from the bank.”
Personally, I’ll be cheering on any
Imperial athlete who makes it to the
games – in any sport.
Speaking of cheering, what of the so-
cial side of rowing? We don’t often see
the oarpeople (not sure if that’s PC or
not? – Ed.) around the union, as they
tend to be down by the boathouse any-
way. Does he have the time to take a
breather and enjoy a drink with your
rowing mates, I ask – or is the training
regime just too strict?
According to Patrick, it’s about get-
ting the balance right: “Training is de-
manding but there’s a big social side
built around the Boathouse and the
fact that most of us live in Putney. We
normally save the mad-for-it nights out
for after races.” He then lets me in on
a further piece of (confidential?) infor-
mation: “ICSMBC were kind enough
to expose the weaknesses in our drink-
ing ability at our joint pub crawl re-
cently . . . maybe we should work on
that, but we wouldn’t want to steal
their thunder.” Wise words from the
captain there.
Finally, as is customary, I ask him a
bit about himself. How did he get into
rowing? “I started rowing as a begin-
ner in my first year at IC by default –
I was too fat at the time to make the
squash team. It’s incredibly addictive
and I like the potential for personal

development as well as teamwork.” I
can’t help but think that squash lost out
somewhere along the way.
What have his personal achivements
been so far, then? He is hesitant to
make much of this question – unsure
whether people are going to be inter-
ested or not. I tell him that most stu-
dents are interested in seeing the peo-
ple behind the clubs. “Well, I won three
BUCS gold medals last year, and came
23rd at Men’s Eights (also in 2011)
winning a pennant.
On the back of that, I think it’s safe
to say: bring on the races! Good luck to
ICBC for the rest of the season.
