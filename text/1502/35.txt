To believe or not to believe?
Was Shakespeare a fraud? The gener-
ally accepted answer is “no” but the
debate will go on, new evidence will be
found, and the sceptics will always find
holes in the already laid-out, widely
known historical events. It’s an inter-
esting notion though, something that
shouldn’t possibly be immediately
dismissed. If there is compelling rea-
son to actually doubt the authorship
of William Shakespeare, the man who
has been the icon of English literature
for centuries, then bring it on, which
is what the brave Emmerich sets out to
do.
Yes, the man who loves destroy-
ing our beloved planet (Independence
Day, The Day After Tomorrow) is the
man directing a thought-provoking,
“what-if” period piece. A change in
genre for sure, but Emmerich’s Anon-
ymous is just as intense as when he
spends millions of dollars sucking ev-
ery last breath out of the human race.
Set in Elizabethan England, London is
transformed into a grim, damp place of
greed, betrayal, jealousy, and a whole
load of back-stabbing. This moral cor-
ruption extends to people of all social
classes, from the grey streets of the
English capital, to the colourful royal
courts where the ageing Elizabeth I
(Vanessa Redgrave) rules her country
with her humongous dresses and fright-
ening make-up.
A firm prologue, delivered with con-
viction by Derek Jacobi, sets the tone –
that William Shakespeare never wrote
a single word of “his” work. How is
this possible? First, there’s Edward
de Vere, Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans),
whose brilliance with his words and
prose came to life even at a young
age. Playing Puck from A Midsummer
Night’s Dream at the age of ten, he
even enchanted the then-young Eliza-
beth I (Vanessa Redgrave’s daughter
Joely Richardson). But writing plays
is no job for an Earl, especially when
his father-in-law, William Cecil (David
Thewlis), a close advisor to the Queen,
vehemently protests anything involv-
ing art or theatre. He claims that theatre
is the satanic product of worshipping
false idols.
One day however, he stumbles on
something extraordinary. A crowd of
two thousand being moved and united
through one play alone. With his own
plays, he predicts that he could bring
the house down. He approaches Ben
Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), a virtually
unknown playwright, to stage his plays
for him. For years, de Vere has spent
hours putting ink to paper, producing
works such as Macbeth, Hamlet, and
Julius Caesar. By complete accident
however, the good-for-nothing drunk
actor Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall)
ends up taking the writer’s credit. He’s
illiterate too, but the crowd doesn’t
know that. They embrace him, and are
moved by his words.
Success and money corrupt Shake-
speare and his obnoxious behaviour
starts to get on Jonson’s nerves. Spall
is fantastic as the slimy yet hilariously
stupid Shakespeare, a horrifying por-
trayal for anyone who respects the man,
but this unique depiction is a welcome
change, and Spall is an invaluable pres-
ence. Our sympathy goes out to Jonson
more than to anyone else, and Armesto
plays the frustrations of a wronged man
with enough intensity and anger.
Flashbacks that are comprehensibly
edited in reveal more than expected,
diving into the intimate sides of de
Vere and Elizabeth. Disturbing twists
and turns are presented, with dirty se-
crets that have been buried for years
starting to surface. The subplots hardly
ever have happy endings, and the brutal
fight for power is a good fun romp, with
numerous seedy characters pitching in
for unpredictable developments. The
harsh palace life with unstable dynamic
is boosted by the dark scenery made
even more sinister by plenty of shad-
ows coming from hundreds of candles.
Ifans is effortlessly convincing in the
role of a literary genius, and no mat-
ter how hard it may be to believe that
he can whip out a stirring play in a
matter of days, the struggles of an op-
pressed genius, trapped in a society of
strict boundaries is shown well in his
character’s genuine passion for the-
atre. The mother-daughter casting for
Queen Elizabeth works brilliantly here,
as hints of Richardson in Elizabeth’s
youth can be seen later in Redgrave,
both of whom are magnetic their piv-
otal roles; they hold so much power.
This makes her the perfect target for
snarky “advisors” to poison with their
venomous lies, adding another layer of
treacherous palace drama to the already
packed narrative.
Whether you believe in this alter-
nate theory is obviously up to you. But
Anonymous is a confident spin on what
was thought to be a well-known tale.
It would serve well as a period thriller
even for those who are fans of Shake-
speare and his works. Emmerich shows
plenty of promise in directing films
outside his usual disaster-film genre,
and he has managed to create one of
the most exciting guilty pleasures of
this year.

Let’s talk about mummy’s little monster
moment at which they clearly become
responsible for Kevin’s evil. He appears
to have made it his mission to destroy
his mother’s life before he is even born
– at least from her perspective. Their
behaviour towards one another is self-
perpetuating and fascinating to watch.
Eva certainly considers it to be her
fault, whilst being manipulated by her
son into apathy as he mutilates his little
sister.
Tilda Swinton’s portrayal of Eva is
masterful. By the (chronologically)
later scenes her life has been destroyed
so utterly that the viewer is left unable
to empathise with the strange shell that
has been left. After losing her family
and business (exactly how she loses
her money is not really explained – one
of the film’s few narrative slips) and
gaining the almost universal hatred of
the townspeople she is left completely
alienated and alone. Kevin is all she
Every scene contains a strong under-
current of violence, from Kevin’s trau-
matic birth through to the mass-murder
which is the culmination of his life.
There is extensive use of bright colour
– most obviously red, which symbolises
first the threat and later the paralysing
guilt of Kevin’s traumatised mother.
The camera focuses on awkward and
anxious movements of hands, feet and
mouths. A shot involving the consump-
tion of a lychee is particularly vile.
The film opts out somewhat from the
discussion of nature/nurture that was
so prevalent in the book, exchanging
realist interactions with an oppressive
and immediate sense of doom. In this
it has much more in common with para-
noid horror films like Rosemary’s Baby
than the kitchen-sink mundane school
of nastiness. While Kevin’s mother
Eva and father Franklin are not the best
parents, it is impossible to establish a
I can’t say that I walked into We Need
to Talk About Kevin expecting a trippy,
synaesthetic nightmare. But that’s what
I got, and it was very good with it too.
The film is intensely visual – sparse on
dialogue and filled with kaleidoscopic
and non-chronological sequences, par-
ticularly in the first half. The linearity
of the closing scenes is less impressive
in many ways, in spite of Ezra Miller’s
hypnotically ugly and malevolent pres-
ence as the teenage Kevin.
Oh my god...you’ve been tangoed!

Kevin
Where the hell’s the tomato soup?!
has left. Since his infancy, each has
been the only one to truly understand
the other. Their love, written in hatred
as it is, is the only survivor of Kevin’s
massacre. As individuals, neither made
it out alive.
Incidentally, who should sit next to
me in the cinema but Simon Amstell! In
retrospect I probably should have asked
him what he thought.
