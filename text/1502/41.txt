Library Cafe
As I generally feast upon the sandwich selection and the occasional
jacket potato in the Library Cafe, my comments will be based upon
these! In general, the taste is rather good (maybe except for the
falafel...). Value is good compared with the closest non-campus food
sources. 7/10

I often eat here. Portions are large and the price is fair. Sometimes,
especially during peak times, the queue is a bit too long. However,
students are served fast so I don’t have to wait for long.
Sandwich selection is good too, I usually have the Chicken & Bacon.
Salads, on the other hand, aren’t so good. The one time I had one, it
was tasteless so I had to add every kind of sauces I could find.
Overall, the Library Cafe offers good quality food and it’s a nice
place to have your snack. 6/10

Sometimes, the food is quite
good but sometimes it’s not.
There is mostly Asian food
on offer, and it’s not of the
best quality. 6/10

Half of the days the food is good
and half of the days it is not. There
certainly is room for improvement. It
definitely qualifies as a second choice,
not as a first.

Your opinion could make a change!
Most of the times, there are
only one or two dishes I can
eat. Food is of average quality
and the prices could be lower,
maybe by 30p or 40p. 6/10
