The (actual) League table is back! It doesn’t have all the
teams in it yet, as some of you haven’t played yet...but will
be updated every week.
The Imperial Immortals American Football
team stormed through for another victory this
Sunday with a hard fought battle against the
Royal Holloway Bears. At their last meeting
the Bears had won by the closest of margins
(scoring a field goal in 3rd overtime) so the
Immortals stepped on the field with something
to prove. With the momentum of last weeks
win behind them the Immortals finished the
game with their first shut-out of the season
and a well earned 19 points.
The first half went very well for the Immor-
tals, receiving the kickoff and driving the ball
up the field repeatedly with power running by
Tino Millar; breaking a number of tackles and
carrying two of the Bears Linebackers into
the endzone to score the first touchdown of
the game. However, there were moments that
the Immortals struggled against some power-
ful players, needing to make long yards on
third down. With the weather perfect the team
could turn to its passing game; Michael Pea-
cock making an important catch in the Bears
red zone to ensure first down. The catch of the
day however came just before the half, with
the Immortals Quarterback Bob Wolsten-
holme having plenty of time to throw a 40
yard pass to rookie Wide Receiver Max Hol-
lister who was free to run it to the endzone for
the last score of the half.
The Surrey offense struggled all game; hav-
ing a number of players injured by the hard
hitting Immortals defense. Not only were the
Bears unable to keep the Defense away from
their quarterback, any completed pass or run
was shut down quickly by fast pursuit and
quality tackling. To top off their awful half,
the Bears second choice Quarterback, under
pressure from rushing lineman Temi Ladega,
threw a lofted pass straight into the arms of
waiting linebacker Dexter Valencia who re-
turned for the first defensive touchdown in
Immortals history. With the Surrey offense
pushed back to their touchdown line after
kick-off, Imperial hopes for a safety (sacking
the quarterback in their own endzone) were
dashed when the half was called and a down-
cast Holloway team stumbled off the field
with the score at 19-0.
However in the second half Royal Holloway
stepped up their game. The Immortals clearly
were suffering from over-confidence as the
offense seemed lackluster; failing to drive the
ball repeatedly and having to punt a number
of times. Meanwhile the Holloway defense
showed aggression and fought incredibly hard
for every tackle, with a solid effort to try and
pull Holloway back into the game. Even with
this Imperial still came close to scoring again;
until Bob Wolstenholme threw yet another ill-
conceived pass straight into the arms of a Hol-
loway Linebacker. Thankfully he was tackled
to the ground immediately before any yards
could be made. The defense maintained their
dominance throughout the second half, with
Holloway losing their Centre due to injury it
was even easier for the Immortals to blow-up
any potential running plays in the Holloway
backfield. In fact, this game had the highest
number of interceptions and turnovers as the
Immortals forced the Bears to keep making
mistakes. Veteran Cornerback George Barnes
making a fantastic interception but was unable
to run it in to the Bears endzone due to age and
lack of pace.
In the final quarter of the game Holloway
realized they had been thoroughly beaten and
instead turned to poor sportsmanship. Unfor-
tunately resorting to poor play and question-
able behavior in an attempt to force the Im-
mortals to their level. Thankfully, the Imperial
team remained calm and played the football
they wanted to play; finishing the game with
a shut-out.
The game was incredibly hard fought but
the team look forward to their game next Sun-
day against the Reading Renegades. If you’d
like to get involved in the sport the team is
currently looking for physically large guys to
play as linemen. If you think you would like to
give it a go, message us by searching ‘Impe-
rial Immortals AFC’ on Facebook or Twitter.
