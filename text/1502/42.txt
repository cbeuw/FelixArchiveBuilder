Student emerges from Huxley after 20 years
A
40-year-old man re-
ported to have a beard
“as long as your mum
is wide” was spotted
exiting the Huxley
building via Queen’s Gate last Mon-
day, having spent two decades find-
ing his way out. After being stopped
by security, who mistook him for a
homeless person seeking shelter, he
claimed to be an ex-student of Im-
perial who got lost after looking for
the room he had a tutorial in.
Huxley’s layout is notoriously
confusing: room numbers run in
an order not discernible without
advanced mathematical knowl-
The particular individual who “pulled” these pints was very dehydrated.
Don’t even ask about where the froth came from

H
Hydrogen
Ooh, look at me, I’m 70% of all
visible matter in the Universe! I
was around before the Universe
was cool! Do you want another
Universe to house your ego as
well? God, just do the periodic
table a favour and fuck off. Oh,
and while you’re at it, take off
those oversized glasses.
edge, resulting in the commonplace
sight of undergraduates circling the
building like pillocks.
“I tried to ask people for direc-
tions, but everyone avoided eye
contact like they were socially
awkward or something. After two
weeks I gave up trying to escape so
I learned how to survive by sneak-
ing into offices for food and water
while their owners were out. I even
stole the odd problem sheet to keep
myself entertained.”
The student is expected to receive
counselling and be brought up to
speed about the world’s events since
1991, as per protocol for individu-
als who have been stranded from
civilisation or travelled forward in
time.
Currently Universal Studios is in-
terviewing the man, with a view to
make next summer’s blockbuster:
it has been described as “Castaway
meets The Terminal, but with nei-
ther the humour, suspense nor Tom
Hanks”.
Channel 4 is also jumping on the
bandwagon, with plans to com-
mission a six-part survival series
starring Bear Grylls. Bear Grylls
celebrated the good news with an
ice-cold pint of urine, noting that it
still tasted better than Blackthorn.
The Alternative Periodic Table
Chemical elements can’t talk, no matter how much acid you take. The
following is a completely bizarre world created by someone who feels
the need to assign human qualities to everything, because
deep down they are so very lonely. Hands-on-crotch-on-
Chatroulette lonely.

Cs
Caesium
What a stud, eh? Voted “Most
Electropositive” in his high
school yearbook, since francium
was nowhere to be found. Fluo-
rine can’t get enough of him, it’s
just a shame that he gets a bit
too excited and literally explodes
when he touches her. Only once,
though. That guy from American
Pie is still the bigger loser.

Hg
Mercury
The metal that just cannot keep
its shit together. Looked upon
with disdain by fellow transition
metals: “You call that a melting
point? You should be ashamed
of yourself!”. Iron likes to pre-
tend he’s a big man like that
until tungsten comes along and
shows him who’s the real wolf-
ram among sheep.

Au
Gold
Have you ever tried winding this
guy up? There is almost nothing
that will get to him. Mention his
(atomic) weight? Eh, he’s not
the fattest. He just sits there,
glistening yellow with a stupid
grin. He does get creeped out
by mercury though, and runs for
cover if you ever mention “aqua
regia”.

F
Fluorine
The biggest slut of the periodic
table. Christ, you’ll even sleep
with xenon, that fat ugly thing
in group 8/on the rugby team.
Chlorine is constantly jealous
of her because she gets to do
some “hydrogen bonding”. If
you’re shagging number 1 why
try harder?

He
Helium
You’re anorexic and nobody
will go near you. From afar, you
hear jibes from neon and argon:
“lose more neutrons, fatty!”. You
pick yourself up and head off
to the nearest particle collider
and throw yourself in front of a
proton beam.
