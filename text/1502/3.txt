A new online calculator was launched
this week by Imperial, aiming to give
prospective students better access to
information on the financial support
available to help fund their studies.
With tuition fees rising to £9,000 per
year and new financial support arrange-
ments being introduced by the College,
the calculator is designed to help pro-
spective undergraduates considering
joining in September 2012. By input-
ting details about their financial cir-
cumstances, prospective students and
parents can receive information on the
support they may be entitled to, from
both Imperial and government sources.

rial College London, said: “Over the
last year, we’ve been working closely
with out Students’ Union to develop
a financial support package that is at-
tractive and reassuring to prospective
students. The new web tool helps us to
communicate that package alongside
the other types of financial assistance
available to students from government
sources. It gives anyone considering
undergraduate study at Imperial clear
advice on what support they may be
eligible for and reinforces our message
that if you have the ability to manage
our courses, we will help you manage
our costs.”
Scott Heath, President of Impe-
rial College Union, said: “As a stu-
dent from a single-parent family I am
greatly aware of the financial consid-
erations around university application.
Tools such as the finance calculator are
invaluable, as they make it clear how
much support prospective students
could get if they come to Imperial. To
anyone who is considering applying, or
is just curious about the result, I rec-
ommend that they try the calculator
today.”

Exhibition Road hosts festival to
coincide with Olympic Games
For those of you planning a work place-
ment this summer, here’s something that
might make you reconsider. The (Ex-
hibition) Road Show, a nine-day street
festival being held right on Imperial’s
doorstep, is set to be unmissable. Part
of the wider celebrations for the 2012
Olympics, the event will be held from
July 28 until August 5, coinciding with
the beginning of the Games.
The event draws parallels with Ex-
hibition Road’s original namesake: the
Great Exhibition of 1851. The blueprint
for all ‘Great Exhibitions’ to come, it
drew people from all over the world to
marvel at its exhibits, presented in the
spectacular (now destroyed) Crystal
Palace in Hyde Park.
During next year’s festival, the
lengthy refurbishment works on Exhibi-
tion Road – long the chagrin of Imperial
students rushing to morning lectures –
Navid Nabijou
will be displayed in all their glory, along
with large trailers hosting an array of
different entertainments. Amongst the
exhibits lined up are a number of art-sci-
ence collaborations; and in the evening a
live orchestra will accompany ballroom
ual household income of up to £60,000
will be eligible. Those students in the
top bracket (from households with an
income of £55,001 to £60,000), will
receive a £900 bursary. At the other
end of the scale, a maximum amount
of £6,000 will go to home undergradu-
ate students from households with an
annual residual household income of
up to £25,000. Of this £6,000, £2,500
of this will be used directly towards
paying tuition fees, whilst the remain-
ing £3,500 will be paid directly into the
student’s bank account.
The launch of the new calculator
on Monday coincided with Student
Finance Day, designed to explain the
changes to student finance from 2012
and improve understanding of the new
system.
