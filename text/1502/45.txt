The harrowing, horribly pixellated
effects of climate change are shown
in this puzzle. Watch as your twisted
logic slowly reveals inevitable envi-
ronmental destruction. Hmm... Maybe
puzzles isn’t the best place for this stuff
after all...
The cells in a grid have to be coloured
or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many un-
broken lines of filled-in squares there
are in any given row or column. Look
at last week’s solution to see what a
typical solution looks like.
The overall solution should yield
some sort of picture, or as good as a
picture can look in monochrome on a
15x15 grid.
As usual, answers to puzzles.felix@
