O
ur streets are currently
being occupied by
aggressive, murder-
ous, polluting inhab-
itants: cars. They are
effectively environmental squatters.
Unfortunately, whereas the crimi-
nalisation of squatting, which was
voted through the Commons the
other week, will throw thousands of
the most vulnerable in our society
onto the street, it will do nothing to
solve the environmental and social
ills of cars. However, as it’s Green
Week and all, I’m taking this oppor-
tunity to explain why we don’t need
them (which hopefully won’t be too
difficult as west London is the most
congested area of London I cycle
through).
Simply put: our society is trapped
in a dangerous car culture. As Lon-
don students, it may not be an issue
during term time, but a large propor-
tion of us probably drive when we
get home in the holidays. A quarter
of journeys though are less than 2
miles; which for the majority of us
can be easily substituted by walking,
biking and/or taking the bus. The
longer journeys can also regularly
be replaced by train and coach. It’s
an interesting point from research
that people tend to overestimate the
length of time to undertake a jour-
ney by public transport but underes-
timate that same journey by car. We
have actually warped the usefulness
of cars in our minds, and the pseudo-
freedom they promise us. Ask your-
self: how free are you in traffic jams
or stuck behind a tractor? This car
obsession is damaging our planet, as
nearly a fifth of our country’s carbon
dioxide emissions come out of their
exhaust pipes.
Environmentally, cars are not just
responsible for a large proportion of
climate change, but also, in cities,
pollute the air we breathe. A recent
report of 17 European cities by Ger-
man environmental groups ranked
London as one of the worst for air
pollution. This was attributed to the
retraction of the congestion charge
from West London, rises in public
transport costs and a lack of invest-
ment in clean buses.
There is also a social justice issue
in this pollution. The statistical ge-
ographer, Danny Dorling, found that
the places with the highest poverty
rates were the areas of greatest pol-
lution, but that also the inhabitants
of these areas emitted the least. Es-
sentially, due to our road distribu-
tion, the most affluent – who are re-
sponsible for the majority of driving
and polluting – are destroying the air
quality where the poorest in our so-
ciety live.
On top of the environmental fac-
tors, cars are too often overlooked
as the murderers they are. You may
think this is strong language, but
when a terrorist attack, often pro-
voked by imperialist wars, to every-
one’s regret kills 50 people we are
up in arms. New laws are brought
in, our civil liberties etched away
and we go to war with two countries.
However, this is minor compared to
the deaths at the hands of cars, which
we do nothing about as more people
die every year.
Danny Dorling has done a lot of
work on the deaths caused by cars.
He showed that the ratio of men to
women dying between the ages of 20
and 30 has hit an historical high. It is
greater than the World Wars, and that
this is a consequence of car deaths.
Car deaths are the single biggest kill-
er of the under 35s, and for people
of undergraduate age, cars account
for nearly half of the non-medical re-
lated deaths. These deaths are com-
pletely pointless and Danny Dorling
refers to cars as the open sewers of

The news that the management training
company Coalescence Consulting has
received payments of £39,570 this finan-
cial year may raise a few eyebrows. While
Mark Davies, Chief Executive of the Im-
perial College Healthcare NHS Trust, has
stated that, “On joining Imperial I rightly
declared an interest in the company and
resigned as a director of Coalescence to
avoid any issues of a conflict of interest.
I have had nothing to do with the commis-
sioning of any work historic or ongoing,”
he remains a Senior Consultant and Ex-
ecutive Coach for the company, with his
wife in the position of Managing Director.
Not only is the issue of conflicts of inter-
est at best not entirely clear, but in the
current economic climate and continu-
ing financial instability, it is fair to ask
whether it is appropriate for a company to
continue to pay out large sums of money
for what are described as “innovative,
bespoke organisational development ser-
vices for health and social care, to help
you, your team and your organisation suc-
ceed” on the Coalescence website. The
intrinsic value of such courses should be
thoroughly determined and subsequently
reviewed.
The Imperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust is facing a budget deficit in excess
of £35m and there have been strong alle-
gations that St Mary’s may close as part
of a cost saving exercise, despite protes-
tation from senior figures. It is therefore
not entirely surprising that the news was
picked up in varying degrees by the na-
tional media: Private Eye, The Telegraph,
and The Sunday Times all covering the
issue. Despite Mark Davies’ attempts to
clarify the allegations, the story is certain
to at least cause a few blushes amongst
senior staff.
In his email to the staff, Davies con-
cludes that “At a time when it is very clear
that we are facing very large operational
and financial challenges, I would ask
that they do not deter us from our abso-
lute priority of providing the best possi-
ble care to our patients.” While Felix ac-
tively supports his keenness to resolve
the financial issues of the Trust, it does
not preclude that until the matter of any
wrongdoing is fully resolved the news will
remain disquieting for staff, concerned
not only for the their own job security but
for the wellbeing of the entire Trust in a
week when figures showed unemployment
rising by a further 129,000 to 2.62m in
the last three months and the Bank of
England cutting its forecasts for growth in
2011 and 2012 to approximately 1%. We
sincerely hope that there will be a robust
and proper investigation into the affair.
the 21st century, and that hopefully,
like with open sewers, we will soon
rid our streets of cars and the deaths
they cause.
We have not let cars invade our
lives without a fight. The 90s saw the
anti-roads movement with the cam-
paign to stop the Newbury bypass
and ‘Reclaim The Streets’, shutting
down roads and motorways for large
parties, showing how fun life without
roads can be. The anti-roads move-
ment caused the most expensive evic-
tion ever as a soon to be demolished
street had a 70ft tower erected on
top of a house to stop the motorway
that was inevitably built in its place.
Currently, monthly bike rides, called
Critical Masses, of up to 1000 people
swamp the streets of London bringing
cars to a stand still as they regularly
cycle to places where cyclists have
been killed, paying their respects
(South Bank of Waterloo Bridge,
7pm, last Friday of every month if
you’re interested). The ex-mayor of
Bogota, Enrique Penalosa, remarked
that you can have a “city friendly to
cars, or a city friendly to people, not
both”. Let’s make ours friendly to
people and the environment.
