Lolcat of teh week
So we’ve gone a little environmentally
mad this week. Next Monday marks the
beginning of Green Week, where Imperial
holds several environment-themed
events. You might just notice the green
headers throughout the paper this week.
Check them out, we’ve also gone fact
crazy. And I mean literally everywhere.
Our Environmental Fact Guru has earned
their year’s (zero) salary with this week’s
performance. Have a look at our double
page spread, see what events take your
fancy, and get going!

What’s on
RAG LOST
Beit Quad, Imperial College Union
Saturday 26 November
Possibly the most fun you can have without spend-
ing any money, LOST is a unique event where you
wind up somewhere in the countryside and all you
need to do is get back to the Union for a well-earned
drink. The day starts with a blindfolded coach trip,
and then you need to beg and barter your way back,
with prizes for most interesting ride hitched and
highest raisers.
