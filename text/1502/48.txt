Travelling the long distance to Chiches-
ter and producing a convincing perfor-
mance against a physical minded team
is not an easy feat and as a result this
fixtures has, in recent years, been a tight
affair. Unsurprisingly, the most recent
clash was no different, yet the grit and
determination shown by Imperial was
typical of the never say die attitude
which this side has shown over the past
few years.
Imperial arrived well ahead of kick
off and were able to enjoy a relaxed
and lengthy warm up, despite their
ideal preparation, it was Chichester who
struck first. After Imperial put good
pressure on the Chichester scrum within
the Imperial 22 meter line, the ball was
recycled and Chichester’s full back
cut between George Lane and Michael
Floyd in the centre to go through and
score, with the conversion added. Go-
ing behind so early did not spring Impe-
rial to life but they good pressure deep
within Chichester’s half allowed fly half
James Cox to take a penalty opportunity
and cut the deficit to four points. Al-
though Chichester may not have had the
technical acumen which Imperial pos-
sessed, they were using their physical
game to good effect around the fringes
of rucks. Their physical endeavour was
rewarded with a second try which was
again converted. Imperial struggled to
find an opening and exasperated coach
Brimah Kebbie implored them to use
the open side to greater effect. After
good pressure within the Chichester
half, Imperial were able to use their
driven lineout, caught by Chris Mc-
Geough, to good effect and come away
with five points courtesy of Sean Baker.
Imperial lost full back James Hayward
before halftime to a neck injury but
were able to hold out until the break
trailing by just six.
Again it was Chichester who had the
upper hand at the outset of the second
half; despite this good work by the front
row of James Scaife, Roby Kyle and Si-
mon Fenton had the upper hand in the
scrums whilst openside Jack Flanagan
was constantly committing multiple
defenders to bring him down. Impe-
rial scored their second try of the match
through replacement Josh Lowe but
Chichester were not deterred and a long
range effort in order to lead 21-13 going
into the last twenty minutes. Imperial

and needed to dig deep to rescue their
game. Wingers Joe Weddon, who was
named man of the match, and Syarif
Hertog were stretching Chichester out
wide and ultimately it was superior fit-
ness which proved to be the decisive in
determining the match.
Imperial spread the Chichester defence
on the open side before switching back
to the blind side and slick hands allowed
replacement Olisa Ufodiama, on for Mi-
chael O’Connell, to score in the corner.
Imperial gave away a needless penal-
ty within their own 22 which Chiches-
ter’s full back duly sent over to cushion
their lead. Sensing the game was still
alive, Imperial surged up the pitch after
the restart and James Cox went over in

the opposite corner to cut Chichester’s
lead to one point with less than five
minutes to go. Upon winning a penalty
within their own half, Imperial kicked
for territory.
David Wilson shrugged off the aver-
age chat directed at him by Chichester
supporters at the lineout which was won
by Charlie Esberger, Imperial then put
on an impressive drive from outside
the Chichester 22 with Ufodiama at the
back going over for his second try to
give Imperial the lead for the first time
in the match, with one minute to go. Im-
perial wound down the clock and came
away with an impressive victory, which
will hopefully spur them on for the rest
of the season.
