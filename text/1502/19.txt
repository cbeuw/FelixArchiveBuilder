COMMENT
FELIX Friday 18 november 2011 19
We’re not going to patronise you by saying that the views expressed are
the opinions of the authors, not Felix. Oh, wait, we are. Ooops.

T
he fact that I’m still alive is
surprising to say the least.
Every day, my life is a
constant struggle against
the innumerable dangers
that surround me. Some are obvious;
cycling to college focuses the sum ha-
tred of all commuters on my little two
wheels. My home is no safer; I actually
pay for deadly substances like electric-
ity and gas to be pumped through into
my living space. At night, I sleep with
a blanket and pillows. How I haven’t
smothered myself is a mystery.
But of all these dangers, there are two
I am especially wary of. These nemeses
are all the more dangerous because they
are so often overlooked. They are com-
monly encountered by most people ev-
ery day, in some shape or form. Most
don’t pay them a second thought but
I pay them third and fourth thoughts.
Even fifth thoughts when I’m feeling
particularly paranoid. Knowing of the
threat they pose is one way of protect-
ing myself against them.
I’m talking about cats and babies.
Don’t laugh.
It is a criminal offence to carry a knife
but there is no such crime for carrying
a cat, despite having more than a dozen
times the number of blades. I have per-
sonal evidence that a cat’s claws can
penetrate denim, corduroy, lead and
human skin – in that order. Just as an
offensive weapon cats are dangerous,
but it is coupled with a cold and most
supreme intelligence. The most benign
expression I have ever read in a cat is

Calm down dear, it’s only an opinion!
Cats and babies
one of weary tolerance. Cats are more
than capable of taking over the world.
The only reason that they don’t is that
they would have to feed themselves
afterwards, which would be the most
tremendous bother. But conspiring to
ruin my life and/or corduroy trousers is
child’s play for them.
Babies are even worse because they
are even more innocuous. They just lie
there all day, laughing and crying, eat-
ing and pooping. Not an obvious danger
to anyone, providing they’re wearing
nose-clips at all times. They don’t even
seem to have the same otherworldly in-
telligence of cats – or do they? We talk
nonsense to babies and suppose that
they have all the smarts of a steamed
pumpkin. I think these biases colour
our views. Ask a baby about the missing
works of Shakespeare or the Riemann
hypothesis or string theory and you may
be treated to some very sagely stares.
But sadly we don’t – instead, we dangle
our keys in front of them.
This constant underestimation com-
bined with a child-like image of justice
can lead babies to be pretty vindictive.
You make choo-choo sounds with a
spoonful of mushy peas; the only fair
retaliation is to vomit over the back of
your fancy evening dress. If you happen
to be wearing it at the time, that is just
icing on the karmic cake.
A house with both a cat and baby is
where angels fear to tread. Cold intel-
ligence and tempered, pure, diapered
vengeance is a match made in the dark-
est bowels of hell. There is nothing a cat
S
ilvio Berlusconi has proved
himself a great salesman
and a poor statesman.
Sounds good, doesn’t it?
Has a certain panache. The
only thing is, I didn’t come up with
it. The succinct, elegant sentence was
written by Beppe Severgnini, the repu-
table Italian political commentator,
in a recent Financial Times column.
My opinions on Berlusconi’s reign
as Prime Minister of the eurozone’s
third largest economy are limited to
what I have read in national media; I
have never met an Italian politician, let
alone voted in an Italian election. And
herein lies the problem with student
opinion pieces: they cannot be more
than a regurgitation of other, profes-
sional, columnist’s original thoughts.
A newspaper’s prime objective is
to inform the reader. It is fair to ask
how this can achieved by voicing the
opinions of students whose best source
of information is Question Time and
Newsnight. Arguably, the News sec-
tion of Felix is the best place where
the reader can find unique, researched
journalism in this publication. Unlike
Nick Robinson or Simon Jenkins, stu-
dent columnists don’t lunch with top
brass politicians, patiently digging for
the truth behind the headlines.
Yet, unlike national media, Felix’s
key purpose is to act as a hub for stu-
dents to express their creativity. At a
predominately science-based univer-
sity, Felix holds a unique role in pro-
viding a much needed artistic outlet
and puts to bed the misconception that
Imperial students are all geeky, singu-
larly focused boffins. The News sec-
tion is there to inform the reader, both
students and staff, of college events
in a similar vein to local town news-
papers. The Comment section of Felix
is debatably a more selfish place where
students get to indulge in forming, at
times ill-constructed (much like this
piece), rationalised opinions on, pri-
marily, current affairs.
This paper has, over recent weeks,
published many articles on religion.
It’s encouraging to see that students
take a keen interest in the issues, but
if I want to form my own view on the
subject I will read Dawkins’ infamous
book and speak to the College Chap-
lain personally. The same goes for the
Jeremy Kyle debate; if I want to make
a judgment, I’ll watch the show for
myself. And, more recently, if I wish
to form an opinion on the Occupy Lon-
and a baby cannot do and heaven help
you if you have crossed them. For this
reason, not only do I lock my doors at
night – I also lock the cat-flap.
What terrifies me most is not cats and
babies themselves – though awful in
don movement, I’m better off going to
St Paul’s than reading an atrociously
formed argument in Felix. In short, I’ll
resort to more robust, better-informed
outlets.
As a result, if I disagree with some-
one’s opinion in this paper, I am likely
to turn a blind eye and move on. No-
body likes to be demonised by their
peers for something they have writ-
ten, especially when one has often
meant the tone to be light hearted. Any
single Comment piece in Felix merely
reflects the thoughts of one student,
some you’ll agree with and others you
won’t; each has been written to enter-
tain. Each has also been founded on
incomplete subject knowledge, and as
such should be taken, as per Mr Berlus-
coni’s self-confessed sexual prowess,
with a pinch of salt.
I have personal
evidence that a cat’s
claws can penetrate
denim, corduroy,
lead and human
skin – in that order.

deadly of predators. And babies?
We all know what they grow up into.
This is terrifying. Look at that yarn ball. Creepy
