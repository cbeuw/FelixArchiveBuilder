M
y unquestionable
faith in the non-
existence of an inef-
fable, unfathomable
and utterly unintel-
ligible being has been brought into
question. “Aha! The fundamentalist
atheist finally sees that the existence
of the ultimate voyeur (as Sartre
would put it…) is still very much up
for debate.” What has brought about
this paradigm shift?
The past couple of weeks have seen
a hurricane of religious and at some
points even rational debate. PhilSoc’s
“Is there a rational proof for God”
debate, a guest lecture from William
Lane Craig and a flurry of Felix ar-
ticles on related topics have raised
the age old issue of God and religion
again.
At this stage I must confess. As a
fundamentalist, I have not changed
my mind. My dogmatic faith in rea-
son, evidence and rational thinking
remain an obstacle. Brainwashed by
Bertrand Russell I cannot see the util-
ity of adopting beliefs which are un-
true or at best unlikely. Thus, just as
I have faith in the non-existence of
unicorns, fairies and girls studying
CompSci, I also believe, yes believe,
that anything like the God of Abraham
falls into this category. I would like to
remind the reader that it would be im-
polite to pooh-pooh at my faith at this
stage, as that would be disrespectful
and cause offence. As we all know it is
outrageous to dispute someone’s faith.

I want an armistice
Flogging a dead God
I write this article in response to an
article written two weeks ago entitled
“There’s probably no Dawkins…”
in which Joshua asks “why does
Dawkins refuse to debate Craig?”. It
appears that Joshua’s queries were
answered when Dawkins himself
wrote an article (20th October) in The
Guardian entitled “Why I refuse to
debate William Lane Craig.”… The
only real question to ask is whether
Dawkins’ reasons are legitimate. I
shall not venture down such an alley
and let the reader make up their own
mind after reading Dawkins’ article.
I’d rather get to the next point.
The closing remark of Joshua’s ar-
ticle was of most interest. The article
claims that 4000 views of a YouTube
video of Craig arguing for the exis-
tence of God indicates that this area
is “still a hot topic…” and “very much
open for debate”. Being a blind fol-
lower in the Cult of Dawkins I de-
cided to examine the claims and use
reason to come to a conclusion.
Fifty minutes of my life were
thrown into the past as I watched the
Craig lecture. Unsurprisingly, Craig
was flogging a dead God. All of his ar-
guments are at least 500 years old and
have been thoroughly refuted (See
Russell, Wikipedia, Kant, Google,
Hume). Craig’s arguments included
great classics such as: the ontological
argument (where God is defined into
existence), the cosmological argument
(causality implies the Universe has a
first unphysical cause, let’s label this
L
ast week, we marked the
death of millions of sol-
diers. They had all died
in action at some point
in the last 93 years, since
the start of the First World War. The
eleventh day of the eleventh month
has been marked in this way for years.
In fact, only a handful of people cur-
rently alive today were also alive
when it was not. You might think that
as those who were there in WWI start
to die, the seriousness would start to
wane, that the idea would start to lose
its punch. Even as children we were
all acutely aware of the significance
but also the distance from us. But have
you noticed recently how the tone has
changed?
When I first knew about it, it was an
obviously reverential day called Re-
membrance Day that rarely fell on the
11th November, as it was bunged over
to the nearest Sunday. Some people
wore a poppy for the week or so up
to that weekend, and not afterwards.
By contrast, now, it seems to have re-
gained its previous name, Armistice
Day, and it really does happen on
the 11th November. Almost everyone
wears a poppy, and many people wear
black arm bands or black ribbons as
well. There is also a certain uniformity
to it, with pretty much everyone doing
it in the same way; many of my French
colleagues also wore a poppy despite it
being a symbol of a British charity. In-
evitably some people managed to cock
it up in a thoughtless and shy-making
way. An American I know updated her
Facebook status with “Happy 11th No-
vember”, proving that she has no idea
what Armistice Day means. I tried to
point this out gently but it turned out
that all of her friends who bothered
to comment thought the same as her,
and as doctors, they do not even have
the defence of being stupid. And the
nutters who choose to complain about
wars fought half a millennium ago by
burning large poppies are talked about
at this sort of time, though their activi-
ties are fortunately no longer public.
So, we have a change of tone towards
Armistice Day being taken much more
seriously, at least in Europe. There
is no upset about this; there is an in-
built politeness to anyone in mourning
that deflects negative criticism. But
at any rate, this change seems at odds
with the fact that WWI is a far distant
memory. The last WWI combat vet-
eran died earlier this year. My grand-
parents’ generation were amongst the
youngest to fight in WWII and they
are dying out at alarming speed. So
where does it come from, this change
in tone? It is obviously not a politi-
cal or governmental thing. Even if the
coalition did want to push national
mourning, it would not work: people
do not grieve if they do not want to.
God and stop thinking), the teleologi-
cal argument (the Universe appears to
be made for our existence just like the
puddle on the road thinks the pothole
was made for its existence) and many,
many more.
In Felix’s interview last month,
Craig was asked whether his belief in
God would be diminished if he found
refutations (which he found convinc-
ing) to the arguments he presented.
His response was “I would still have
my belief, because my belief in God
is not based on these arguments… I
think my faith in God is based on the
inner witness of God’s Spirit…”. The
arguments are not strong enough even
to convince himself. This and com-
ments in which he explicitly supports
God’s instructions to commit a geno-
cide are enough to bring into question
the intellectual integrity of any such
debater.
After hundreds of years of argu-
ment, there has been little progress
concerning God’s existence. The de-
bate is only “open” to the extent that
we keep reiterating the same argu-
ments and refutations time and time
again. On all things concerning super-
natural entities which transcend the
understanding, we should take the ad-
vice of Ludwig Wittgenstein: “What
we cannot [intelligibly] speak about
(i.e. the ineffable) we must pass over
in silence.”
The answer is that they do want to, and
this is of course because of the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a new
generation of mourners. The tone has
changed because pretty much every-
body knows someone, knows someone
who knows someone, or knows some-
one who went out with someone who
knows someone, that was killed in the
Middle East. And that does include
‘both sides’ of the war. Realising that
someone you either knew, or were not
that far away from, was killed by an
IED inevitably makes a day of remem-
brance much more personal. It makes
you think about those in the trenches
in WWI who met a similar fate, albeit
a muddier and wetter one. It makes the
Blackadder joke, about what happens
when you step on a landmine, all the
more poignant. And actually, shutting
up and standing still for two minutes
on a given day is a pretty small price
to pay even if you disagree with it.
