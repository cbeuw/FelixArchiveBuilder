Dear Sir,
I know that I am not alone,
when I express mji views about the last
edition of 'Phoenix'.
Mr. D.J. Irving must realize that
the magazine is an outlet and a show
piece for the literary works of members
of I.C., and must to some extent reflect
the nature of our College.
What has happened to Mr. Hill's
Social Page this term?
Messrs Irving, Jarman and Wheeler
have almost monopolized the magazine.
Is this the purpose of the Editorial
Staff?
Mr. Wheeler has succeeded in get-
ting his name into print twenty times,
also his photograph, a competition egot-
istically entitled 'Wheelerisms' and an
article about himself.
Mr. Jarman has been more successful.
His name appears thirty times, and often
in 'big-print'. He too has managed to
get his photograph and a facetious art-
icle about himself printed.
Mr. Irving ought to know that the
Editorial i s not a vehicle for his fas-
oist political views (I oan only hope
that he was trying to be humorous),
while his attack on Professor Blackett
is degrading and fanatical.
The selection of Reotorial Wheel-
erisms was i n extreme bad-taste.
No attempt has been made to collect
or encourage literary material from
students of the College, and the hund-
reds of freshmen probably s t i l l have no
idea that this is also their magazine.
Why have they not been approached?
I feel that the present editorial
policy oan only result in a decline of
the sales, and give both students and
outsiders a false and lowering impression
of what I.C. is oapable of doing.
Tours truly,
Peter Clark.

Access to Booksfor Science Examinees
Lord Verulam said at the Oxford
conference for schoolmasters on Jan.
7th that candidates sitting examinations
in the science should have access to
books during the examination, at any rate
in the more advanced subjects* Such K
examinations should be held in libraries
or within easy reach of them.
Dea- Sir,
I wish to protest, as we a l l
should, against the ton* and content
of the editorial of the last issue of
Phoenix. Whether the editor meant
hia words to be taken seriously or not,
the Fascist dogma contained in thi3 edit-
orial is inexcusable. I may add that
i f he did not intend i t seriously I think
his sense of humour deplorable.
No doubt Mr. Irving has the right
to express his political views but should
he have the right to express them in the
College Magazine? The distribution of
political material within the Union is
forbidden,as Mr. Irving well knows.
Surely then, i t should also be forbidden
in the Phoenix.which is financed by and
widely circulated among members of the
Union.
In noting the glaring untruths and
misconceptions which could only have
stemmed from an ill-informed (or dare I
say uneducated?) mind I have to assume
that the editor is sublimely happy, for
as he himself says,"Ignoranoe is Bliss",
I also feel that critioisra and
attacks on persons well known in I.C.
are more appropriate in the "Confid-
ential* magazine than in a literary
publication of College Students (or
should i t be "several" College students?)
Yours sincerely,
P.N. Potter.
PAUL ROBESON
AT
IMPERIAL COLLEGE
Last term Imperial College was
honoured by a visit from Paul Robeson,
as part of his European Tour. A
guest of the Indian Society, he warned
a packed and expectant Ayrton Hall that
this was neither a funeral nor a
serious recital - "Relax" was his
message at this point, and relax the
audienoe did, under the influence of
the songs with which he opened the
proceedings.
Some critics in this country claim
that Time has robbed Paul Robeson's
voice of some of i t s volume; true or
not, the new rich mellowness that is
here combined with the old Robeson con-
trol and sensitive feeling, gave us a
vocal instrument of astonishing
emotional impact.
The major part of his v i s i t was
occupied in a "conversation" with his
hearers on a wide range of topics -
from tonal languages and jazz rhythmns,
and the debt in this connection that
the New World owes the Old, and thus
back to peace and international co-
operation. Although generally anti-
American, there was no stated political
bias to a l l this - an attempt from the
floor to involve him in an "East
versus West" controversy was, in fact,
suppressed by other members of the
audience.
Facts Figures and the Future of the
Phoenix
* We are printing 2000 copies of
SPRING PHOENIX, almost double the
1957 circulation.
• We have not touched the Union Sub-
sidy since the present editorial team
team took over.
x We are subsidising the mailing of
J00 copies to a l l the British public
Schools and selected boy's grammar
schools out of Phoenix profits.
• Thanks to the efforts of an extre-
mely efficient sales staff, we now sell
more copies of our magazine than does
any other College magazine in the Unitec
Kingdom.
> Kind's College magazine LUCIFER sells
500-600 copies in a College of 2,^.00
students
I THINK THAT THESE FACTS SPEAK FOR
THEMSELVES.

FELIX COMMENT
"The policy of a College magazine i s
a very difficult thing to define in det-
a i l . Unlike most other periodicals the
purpose of such a magazine i s not to
reflect the outlook of the editor and
the editorial staff, although no doubt
in minor details the magazine will owe
something to the idiosyncrasies of
these individuals."
From the Editorial of Phoenix Oat 1925
In an Ayrton Hall f i l l e d with
students whose countries feel so stron-
gly about the questions of independence
and self-determination, Mr. Robeson's
message was very well received. Later,
however, some of the European members
of this audience - and there were not
so very many - expressed a sense of
disappointment. Perhaps "anti-cli-
max" i s the better term. For,
although no one can but admire and
respect Paul Robeson the singer and
actor, Paul Robeson the diplomat and
peacemaker does not ring so true -
his please for "Peace" was almost,
an apologetio intrusion into hia con-
versation, too a r t i f i c i a l to affect
emotionally. Perhaps European reser-
ve ha3 something to do with this
impression, for i t is a l l too easy to
compare Schweitzer with Robeson, as
two musicians serving the world for
other causes.
It seems that the emotional app-
eal (or "publicity value"?) of curing
a few hundred unfortunate natives i s
much lower than Mr. Robeson's.
