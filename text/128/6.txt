PERSONAL VIEW
D E B A T I N G A T IMPERIAL COLLEGE
Lecture notes, example sheets
and laboratory reports are a heavy
yoke to bear, so i t i s only natural
that every student should seek some
means of relaxation: some outlet of
self expression. One may prefer
scrunching other people's heads into
the ground at Had. ington, or another
may be finds breaking arms in the
sophisticated Japanese fashion more
to his taste. (One man's meat i s
another man's poison). My own
particular relaxation i s debating,
because I rather like being rude
politely and there is,to m
y mind,
nothing like a good scrap over r e l i -
gion or politics.
Of course, not a l l the debates
com-'iittee are as intellectual as I
and they have to be humoured by the
slipping i n the odd intellectual mot-
ion like: "This House prefers a
Saucy Sue to a Lovely Lucy", where-
upon I have to entertain the visiting
speakers from Bedford College to coffee
afterwards (because that i s the only
polite thing to do).
Whenever someone starts a speech
by saying: "Unaccustomed to public
speaking as I am " you can be
sure there i s a good time coming, as
he is obviously an old hand. You may
have noticed quite a number of old
hands around the college, and we hoping
they w i l l be pressed into service again
for this term's programme. Among the
forthcoming battle slogans are:
"This House prefers thermometers
to spanners*
"That Britain's Nuclear Policy
i s Inconsequent"
and "That this House should
adjourn indefinitely"
(which w i l l not be regarded as a
motion bf confidence).
I will not give you a l l that
fresher's letter stuff about how good
i t i s for you to learn the art of put-
ting your thoughts into words. Quit*
frankly I do not think debating does
much good for you at a l l , the only
thing that I have acquired since Join-
ing the debates oommittee being a
liking for drawing wicked posters. In
fact, you oome to debates at your own
risk. (I look forward to seeing you
there.)
Finally.on a rather less flippant
note, the debates committee i s anxious
that the society should be a true
reflexion of oollege opinion and we are
always ready to hear suggestions for
motions from any member of the Union.
These Vshould be addressed v i a the Union
Rack to the President of Debates, who
w i l l deal with them suitably.
With which, Mr. Editor, I declare
the House adjourned.

President, Literary and
Debating Society.

The traditional motion: "That
this House has no confidence in Her
Majesty's Government", debated on 4th
December was unique in that i t was
defeated for the first time i n several
years.
Mr. Desmond Donnelly MP who
proposed the motion went to great
pains to explain that there really
was a difference between the Conserva-
tive and Labour parties. Apparently
the House was unimpressed.
Introducing Mr. Anthony Kershaw
MP as a past Secretary of the Conserva-
tive Parliamentary Army Sub-Ctte. and
past Parliamentary Private Secretary
to the Secretary of State for War and
Defence, Mr. Richard Garnett said he
expected a fine warlike speech. How-
ever, Mr. Kershaw remained on the
defensive, proud to be associated with
the Government's record of achieve-
ments.
John Cox, seconding the motion,
decided to ooncentrate on education
alone, attacking the proposed govern-
ment expenditure of Â£400m p.a. on
education as totally inadequate.
Cox's failure to make an a l l -
round declamation of Tory policy left
Martin Bames, seconding the opposi-
tion, i n a quandary. He could only
answer the points he thought Cox might
have made.
A number of lively speeches from
the floor condemned the government for
rising prices, unemployment and out-
dated foreign and colonial policies.
Nor was the government without vocal
supporters, some of whom rose to speak.
One speaker at least this year thought
that government should be taken out of
politics.
Mr. Kershaw summed up by answering
the allegations; made against the govern-
ment. While Mr. Donnelly described
Mr. Kershaw's speech in the way that
the Texans describe the horns of a
steer, there being a point here and a
point there, but an awful lot of bull
in between.
The motion was defeated by 60
votes to 56 with 13 abstentions.

The treatment of the surface and
of the colour of a painting i s an
essential feature of Modern Art, said
Basil Taylor, Librarian of the Royal
College of Art, who was introducing a
series of five General Studies lectures
on Modern Art to be held this term.
The olassioal idea of the surface of a
painting was that i t acted as a win-
dow which led to a three dimensional
world beyond. In contrast, many of
the moderns treated the surface as
a solid impenetrable barrier so that
the painting slapped the viewer in the
face.
Basil Taylor illustrated these
points with a variety of art from a
variety of art from a two dimensional
mediaeval book illustration through the
classical age and the impressionists to
the abstracts and the fauves. He
showed a Deraln with a river green and
the sky red to illustrate what part
colour played i n the grammar of Modern
Art. There were reproductions of
Monet, Cezanne , Gauguin, Kandinsky
and Piet Mondrian. One thing to bear
in mind a l l the time, suggested Basil
Taylor, was that, due to the decline
in patronised art, the contemporary
artist was self employed and was there-
fore concerned to express a personal
philosophy. A particularly startling
Paul KLee was shown to emphasise this.
Further lectures in this provoo-
ative series w i l l be: Jan. 13th,
Cubism; Feb. 3rd, Fauves and Expre3s-
ianism; Feb. 19th, Abstracts; Mar.
12th Surrealism.

THEREBY HANGS A TAIL
The Science Museum Library was
f u l l ; many students were studying and
a nuaber of people were standing at
the bookshelves. An eminent person
walked in, looking very serious, and'
grave. In his hands was a large and
important-looking book. He was reading
this book very thoughtfully and earn-
estly. He was wearing a neat sports-
jacket and flannels. A l l the. occu-
pants of the library were very impres-
sed.

body laughed. His shirt t a i l was
