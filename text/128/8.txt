The first matohss of the Spring
Term were played on Saturday, Jan 10th
and a very promising 3tart to the year
was made with a l l teams recording a win.
The l 3 t XI, playing very wej_i,
heat Finchley 'A' 3-1 on a hard frozen
pitch at Harlington, After being a
goal i n arrears at half-time, three fine
goal3 by Coups, after some good approach
work, finally clinched the i3*sue.
The Znd. and 3rd XI's playing well
on form, beat Battersea I and Poly-
technic Strollers 3-2 and 3-0 respect-
ively. Not to be outdone in any way,
the 6th and 7 t h XI*s kept up the day's
ran by defeating Chelsea II and B.B.C.V
teams respectively.
This Saturday the first three teams
travel to Cambridge to play Christs I
and II and Emmanuel College II, where a
very entertaining day i 3 anticipated.
SAILING
The Autumn term, a term to be rem-
embered as a term with an almost complete
absence of wind,, ended with three I.C.
boats being well placed in the Winter
Series of intercollegiate races for the
KacPherson Trophy, 1,0. boats being
1st., 2nd., and 5th. out of 40 boats.
The helmsmen responsible for this
are Janisz Wilezynski, Graham Taylor
and Colin French.
During the vacation two I.C. boats
visited the Royal Lymington Yacht Club
for the Christmas Open Meeting, where
Fireflies competed for the "Twins
Cup". After some very interesting s a i l -
ing i n fresh winfs the Cup was won by
Graham Taylor of I.C., the other College
helsman - John Welsh - finishing 5th,
RIDING
Fresh spirit and interest has been
infused into the club since last session.
Several new members of a high standard
of horsemanship joined us last term,
and beginners attended courses at H i l l -
oote, Coombe H i l l , and the Civil Service
Riding Schools. Two day rides were
held i n the Chiltem Hills , and were
greatly enjoyed. No mishaps occurred
on these outings apart from after-effects
marked by a tendency of some members to
remain standing on a l l possible occas-
ions for several days after.
Social events included two coffee
evenings i n conjunction with Bedford
College Riding Club at which films on
horsemanship were 3hown; and a very
successful hop. At the latter event,
a remarkable quadruped containing two
budding explorers made' i t s appearance,
and many people put i t down to the
effects of drinking the beer provided
in the Nags Head, alias the Upper Ref-
ectory.
The club is hoping to organise a
summer trek i n the Highlands, and new
members will be welcomed to a l l our
activities.
S W I M M I N G
With the term but a few days old,
the Polo section can report 3 vict-
ories and a dra.? to i t s credit; the
only disappointment being the failure
of the first team to beat Battersea in
the first League match of the season,
the result being a 4-4 draw. However
the second team gained ample revenge
over this slight by hammering Batter-
sea II in thier first League Div.III
match by 10-2. Hills being congrat-
ulated on getting a fine nap hand.
In friendly fixtures, the third team
scored a resounding 6-1 victory over
Westminster College, and the seoond team
followed this up by a 3-0 defeat of
Northern Poly. Despite these successes
the Club has 3 t i l l need of the servloes
of a goalkeeper for me of the lower
teams; could anybody interested please
contact the skipper 7ia the Union Rack.
The last Wednesday of last terra
saw the Mines win the Linstead Swimming
cup for the first time in i t s history.
The gala held at U.L.U. pool for the
fir3t time, was an outstanding success,
and with Mines supporters, who out-
numbered the Guilds and R.C.S. cont-
ingent by about 10-1, literally cheering
their team to victory. The Polo Cup
was won by Guilds, after a series of
close hard-fought games.
M I N E S A T U L U
The President and a large proportion
of the Royal School of Mines Union paid
their first official visit to the U.L.
Union to support the Mines' Swimming
Team i n the Inter-Collegiate Gala. The
RSM team won the swimming events quite
oonvij-iV'-incjlv by 22 points, to the 17
of Guilds, ana the 13 of RCS. Don Shorey
won both the 100 metres freestyle and
butterfly, and the team won both of the
relays.
In the water polo Mines were unfort-
unate in being drawn to play SCS first,
and Immediately afterwards to play Guilds.
They won the first, and then lost to
Guilds. RCS then drew their match with
Guilds, and so the latter were the victors.
Fart of the Mines' victory could be
attributed to the moral support given by
the crowd of 70 Minesmen lining one side
of the pool, with Hitch i n their midst.
There were three supporters from RCS, and
one from Guilds.
After the Gala the crowd retired to
the ULU Bar, which they promptly livened
up. The Editor of Sennet and some of his
staff were there too, and following his
remarks about the Vets singing in the
Bar, he was threatened with debagging.
Rather than face this ignominy he retired
Cwith his staff) to a small room behind
the actual bar, from which he did not
escape until the crowd left.
As ladies were present the songs did
not perhaps reach the usual high standard
of the IC Bar, but nevertheless a rowdy
evening was had by a l l before they
retired to the seclusion of our own
licenced premises.
