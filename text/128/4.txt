For most students, I suppose, "New
Year's Day" i s the Ist. October, and
not the more usual date i n the world
outside. This new calendar year, how-
ever has brought with i t a mixed bag
of College news - the mentions in the
Honours l i s t ; the attack^ from some
quarters, on our oontemporary, "Phoenix",
and the distinguished visit of some
members of ICWA to Holland. The new
year has also brought with i t a;new
upsurge of interest i n the subject of
expeditions - sufficient to carry a
f u l l page in this edition. This i s true
College news, for, even i f you are in
no way connected with any of these
projects, i t i s part of your privilege
as a student to enjoy the feasibility
of doing so.
We are indeed fortunate in this
College in the active work of both
the Exploration Board and the Society.
In recent weeks there has appeared
on various notice-boards around College,
a cyolostyled newssheet called the
"R.C.S. NEWSLETTER". While in no way
intended as a rival to this publica-
tion - this was pointed out at the very
beginning,, the Newsletter i s an
attempt to inform R.C.S. members about
events which affect them personally,
through their union, and to act as a
commentary from R.C.S. point of view,
on College l i f e .
Peter Clarke i s attempting to
produce this regularly, under the aus-
pioes of his Union Offloors, on the
principle that Union Members should
know «1T the time, every time, exaatly
what i s going on.
When i t i s considered, this i s an
unusual service provided by a Student
Union to i t s members - a free informa-
tion bureau, i n fact.
The last issue of last term was
also the last association of "Killer"
Kerrod with this publication - see
profile elsewhere - we shall a l l be
sorry to see him go, but we have at
least made him promise to write to, and
for us, now and again.
Meanwhile, i t is "Business as
usual" and the Editor would welcome
criticisms and certainly material for
insertions into these columns - after
a l l , this i s the paper of our Union.

On the rounds i n the North and West
this week i s THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPP-
INESS, the story of a servant g i r l who
went to China as a missionary, and, after
much tribulation, won the hearts of the
local population. Ingrid Bergman gives
a superb performance as the missionary,
and is ably supported by the late Robert
Donat.

Dr. Helen K. Porter, D.Sc,F.R.S.,
whose appointment to the Chair of
Plant Physiology at the Imperial
College of Science and technology is
announced by the University of London,
becomes the first woman to hold a Chair
at the College.
Dr. Porter's association with
Imperial Collene date3 from 1921 when,
after graduating from Bedford College,
she spent a year in the Department of
Organic Chemistry and was then appointed
Research Assistant in the Department of
Botany. Ten years later she joined the
staff of the Research Institute of Plant
Physiology attached to the College and
concentrated primarily on research in
the field of carbohycrate metabolism.
Shortly after the war she spend a
year in Washington University, St. Louis,
studying enzymological methods. The
subsequent development of her work, in
collaboration with a group of colleagues
and postgraduate research students, led,
with the support of the Nuffield Found-
ation, to the opening in 1953 of an enzy-
mology laboratory in the Plant Physiology
section of the College, to accommodate a
research group under Dr. Porter's direc-
tion.
In 1956 she was elected to Fellowship
of the Royal Society, the twelfth woman
to be so honoured. In 1957 Dr. Porter
was appointed to a new Readership in
Bnzymology at the Imperial College.
Two repeat performances of the
Hoffnung Interplanetary Music Fest-
ival are to be given at the Royal
Festival Hall on Friday Feb. 6th:
no doubt tickets will again be scarce
for this popular event.
The following day a jazz concert
is being given by the Count Basie Orch-
estra: tickets from Harold Davison Ltd.

Terry Thomas and Bernard Bress-
law have teamed up in a new film
TOO M
A
N
Y CROOKS, which is to be shown
next month: this should prove who
really is a "nut-case".
On general release soon will be
BACHELOR OF HEARTS, an amusing skit
on College l i f e in Cambridge, which
should not be taken too seriously.
THE RETIRING EDITOR
His retirement from the post of
Editor of FELLX marks the end of an
active phase of Robin Kerrod' 3 career.
"Killer" (a nick-name of unknown origin)
is a social but not always a sociable
type. He approached the Hostel slowly
over the period of his first two years,
starting at Ndttin? H i l l Gate and rea©-
hing Queen's Gate Terrace last Spring,
where he became one of the most reliable
•ouroes of ooiiee in the vicinity of
•he college. This phase might be
summed up by the paraphase * Per ardua
ad I.C.W.A." The period was alio marked
by a slightly obsessive tendency to oover
available wall-space of his room with
the free gifts from cornflake packets
leading to a debilitating monotony of
diet.
Killer is a believer i n self-
expression: hence the beard, 8-foot
scarf and outsize sweaters. The above
trends, coupled with the influence of
the Wine-Ta»ting Soo. and a liking for
D.H. Lawrence and Aldous Huxley have
produced the man we now find.
His interests are widespread, but
insufficiently varied, leading to a
ooarplex emotional envirorunent whose
influence i s felt as far a field as
Hampstead, Ealing, Sevenoak* and Bristol.
The books by Freud, Jung and Adler on
his shelves probably aggrevate the
situation. A French g i r l , whom he had
known for 3 years, came o.-er last Sumner
and tried to marry him. The shook has
had a lasting effect.
His reasons for resigning may be
summed up by saying that i t i s a pity
to leave I.C. without a degree. This
and certain of the proceeding remarks
may well be noted by first-year men as
an indication of the occupational
hazards of an undergraduate l i f e .
