This year's Mines Ball was held
later i n the tern than usual, on the
last day of t e n i n fact,and provided
a very plesant finale to -what had
become for some an m r increasing
round of parties.
Aa usual, the Ball was vary wall
organised, and the demand for tickets
was such that a l l unsold ones were
called in a week before the Ball took
place, and the subsequent black market
in spare tickets reached astronomical
proportions (on* ticket holder was
offered £3). The Mines Entertainment
Officer, Alan Lewis, in a exclusive
interview, stated that approximately .
30 tickets were sold above last year's
total, and expressed the hope that the
Concert Hall would not be too crowded.
In the event, the hall was full but
not overcrowded, and everyone had a
very pleasant time.
As a change from dancing, there
waa a cabaret featuring Messrs. John
Looae and Thorn. King, accompanied by
Alan Lewis on piano and a musical sketch,
again by Alan Lewis and his wife.
There were a series of commercials in
which Graham King figured as a high-
pressure salesman of various dubious
products. (it was pointed out to
R.C.S. President Peter Kassler that not
one dubious joke was included -
fortunately, he took the remark the
right way).
The official band left at 3 a.m.
an hour later than last year, and the
Jazm Band took over when the proceed-
ings warmed up somewhat.
Mr. Lewis and his helpers should
be congratulated on providing a fitting
olimax to the Christmas term. What
was only a few years ago almost exclus-
ively a Ball for Miners i s new a Ball
organised ljy_ Mines for I.C.
This Ball also saw positively
the last official appearance of Denis
Leston - i n his favourite role of jazs
pianist - an appearanoe which terminated
around 6.30 i n the morning, as with
undiminished fervour he improvised to
an empty Hall. "Even geniuses must
sleep" was verified - even Denis had,
at last, to snatch a l i t t l e rest.
Thus passeth an era.
THE CHRISTMAS ISLANDERS
The Christmas Islanders are not
half so remote as you might imagine.
They are really of this world and w i l l
finitely meat at 5.15 p.m. i n the
Committee Room off Jhe Lower Union
Lounge on the following Fridays:
January 16th, when Tony Brookes w i l l
chat about Shakespearean J ass; Jan-
uary 30th, when an informal symposium
on The Short Story w i l l be introduced
by Peter Jarman and February 13th,
when a similar informal symposium will
be held on Why do Scientists especially
appreciate Music? This will be intro-
duced by George Ripka. An advanced
warning: i f sufficient members have
road the book, i t i s hoped to discuss
Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago on March
13th.
STUDENT SERVICES
On Sunday, January 18th, at
9.30 a.m., the Bishop of Kensington
w i l l oelebrate Holy Communion i n Holy
Trinity Church, next door to the Union.
This service i s intended to meet the
requirements of students i n West Lon-
don, and in particular - students at
Imperial College. This w i l l , in fact,
inaugurate a regit •
* series of services
on «n Sundays du. ; term at this time,
thanks to the kindness of Rev. Clever-
ley Ford and his Parochial Church
Council.
We hope all members of the Church
of Kngland in the College, both stud-
ents and staff, w i l l support the Chap-
laincy in this new venture. The ser-
vioe i s intended not only for those
resident nearby but also for a l l those
in lodgings who have no real a f f i l i a -
tion to any local churoh - and there are
many such people here. Breakfast will
be available afterwards i n Queen Alex-
andra's House, opposite the Union.
We trust that we w i l l see many of
you at this first celebration. Further
details may be obtained from the Acting
Chairman of the Secretary of the Church
Society.

Three independent parties held
meets i n Scotland this Christmas, two
representing the Mountaineering Club,
and the other was- a training trip for
four members of the forthcoming Peru
Expedition.
The party arrived at Braemar, via
the Lake District, on Boxing Day. The
march up into the Cairngorms was started
that evening owing to fine weather and
a f u l l moon, but was halted for the
night s t i l l some five miles from Loch
Etchachan, Ben Macdui, the propsed dest-
ination, by a snow f a l l which continued
for some twelve hours. However, Loch
Etchachan was finally reached, the
weather having deteriorated by this time
to a blizzard, this affording good
practice for pitching tents in high wind
and thick snow. After three days of
continuous blizzard, i t was decided to
return to Braemar, where all clothing
and equipment might be thawed and dried
out. The return was eventually achieved
after an eight hour march, in places
through waist deep snow. New Years Eve
was duly celebrated in the traditional
manner, and the party moved to Glencoe
in the hope of better weather and a
l i t t l e climbing. Fortunately, this
proved the case, and made an excellent
conclusion to the meet, which should
prove invaluable experience in the
Andes this summer.
The latter party had intended to
spend just over a week in practicing
high level camping and snow and ice
climbing in the Cairngorms, this area
being chosen as that having the most
extreme conditions of weather during
this time of year. This was certainly
the case!

TABLE TENNIS
The Table Tennis Club has had a
varied season. The first team have
played with consistent success, with
one match outstanding they have won
six out of their seven matches. Wool-
wich Poly I, the only team to have
beaten I.C. I are expected to win
the League and Cup. I.C. I have also
reached the 3emi-final of the Cup.
The remaining teams have had a
poor season
COOPER A TlON.
It would hardly seem to be necessary
to remind dubs and Teams that i t i s
undoubtedly i n their own interests to
keep their followers informed and up
to date with their fortunes.
Sometimes, however, i t i s necessary
to bully and badger Club offjoints or
members before any sort of report i s
in fact handed in. These reports are
not a test of English - they need only
be a straightforward account of your
team or Club's progress linoe the last
edition of Felix came out.
Surely such cooperation would be to
the benefit of both parties - so why
not write, no matter how l i t t l e or how
much 1
