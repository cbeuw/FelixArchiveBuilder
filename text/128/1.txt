I.C.W.S.C., FOR LONG REGARDED AS THE CINDERELLA SPORTS CLUB OF 1.0. ,
DUB SOLELT TO THE GENERAL LACK OF SUPPORT THAT IT RECEIVES FROM THE
ALREADY- SMtT.T. NUMBER OF POSSIBLE MEMBERS MADE GOOD USE OF THE FIRST
WEEK OF THE CHRISTMAS VACATION TO REMOVE ANT DOUBTS AS TO ITS POTENT-
IAL - WHEN AT FIGHTING STRENGTH.
A team of 10 I.C.W.S.C. members
paid, a long-enraited v i s i t to Holland,
to compete against girls from the Tech-
nical College of the town of Delft,
famous as a centre of Hollands pottery
industry.
Six Events
The team had planned to compete
against the Dutoh girls in no less than
six sports during the f i r s t three days
of their v i s i t . In faot, only four
Batches were eventually played, a l l
resulting in outstanding wins far xxftx
I.C.W.S.C. The two matoher abandoned,
were f i r s t l y , hookey owing t a t he state
of the pitch, and netball- here the
difference in the rules made a
impraticable.
The tenia match was played on an
excellent indoor oourt in the sports
building of the College and despite an
unusual flooring, a l l the matches were
won. There was another easy win, by
U games to 1 i n the table tennis ecu-
test. It was unfortunate that only
two of the Dutoh girls oould play bad-
minton, but these provided the last
competition for I.C.W.S.C. and were also
beaten.
Swimming Surprise
Swinming has never been a strong
I.C.W.S.C. sport, usually owing to the
lack of numbers,a joint entry with
Middlesex Hospital has been necessary
in thi3 country, to raise a oomplete
team. The most exciting match of the
v i s i t to Holland, however, turned
out to be the swimming match. Held
in a public bath, alongside a water-
polo match, the Dutoh girls were at
level pegging with I.C. at the end of
the individual races, so that the fin-
al result depended on the relay. In
this, I.C.W.S.C. established a good lead
at the end of the f i r s t lap, and contin-
ued to increase this to give a decisive
win.
The visit to Delft was also some-
thing of a social occasion, and the I.C.
girls paid a visit to khe Delft pottery
factory, to Amsterdam and Roterdam
before they left.
One can only hope that this
excellent performance in Holland will
encourage some more I.C.W.Arians to be
a l i t t l e less shy about Joining in the
activities of I.C.W.S.C.
The Imperial College Union

Of two of i t s members - both'

They were Ray Gibbons (ex
R.S.M.), killed in an o i l -
field accident and Ray Stone
(ex R.C.S.), killed i n a road
accident.
