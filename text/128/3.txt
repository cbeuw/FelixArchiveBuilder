The prophets of doom who 3 i t , pen3 raised, waiting to write the obituary of
I.C., must he sadly disappointed in the enthusiastic activities resulting in the
various expeditions whioh leave this country with the participation of Imperial
students and the hacking of the Exploration Board.
Following on the scientific expeditions, to Ghana, Iceland and Norway, there
are 6 proposed for this. Two w i l l visit South America, one to the Azores,one to
Jugoslavia, one to Iceland and the sixth to Jan Mayen Land.
APOLOBAMBA
Formerly known as the Peru
Expedition i t i s almost a year since
the first idea was born. Since this
time sufficient support has bean forth-
coming to put this expedition on a •
sound working and financial basis.
The i n i t i a l support from the I.C.
Exploration Board was £500, followed by
a second grant also of £500. Support
has also been received from the Mount
Everest Foundation, the Royal Geographi-
cal Sooiety and from the Bolivian
Andino Club.
The mountain area to be visited
is on the borders of Bolivia and Peru,
called the Nudo de Apolobamba ranging
from 16,000 to 20,000 f t .
Felix announced the members of the
expedition when they were selected early
in the first term of this year. Under
the leadership of Dr. Geoff. Bratt (now
with Eric Shiptan in Patagonia), the team
is as follows:
a
B i l l Melbourne (Aero P.G,
John Jenkinson lChem.Eng.
Tony Ewart (Mining Geology P.G.)
Arthur Smith (3rd Yr. Mining Geo)
Paul Garrard (2nd Yr. Geology)
The aim of the expedition i s to
explore and map the Bolivian part of
the mountain range, oarry out a geolo-
gical survey of a slightly larger area
to join up with previous work, and to
climb the Soral Peaks which are on the
Bolivian side. The approach w i l l be
from La Paz in Bolivia, i n i t i a l l y by
truck and then i t is hoped to be able
to set up a base camp after several days
march with a mule team and porters.
ICELAND
Although not officially an indivi-
dual expedition but an extension of
work carried on in I.e., this party
has also applied far support, but not
financial aid from the Exploration
Board.
The Party w i l l be mapping a vol-
oanic area and carrying on the work
begun by previous expeditions (1956 and
1958) and by Dr. Walker of this College.
The three members w i l l be:
R. Edwards
G. Borsley (Mrs.) ) II Geology
C. Blake )
JUGOSLAVIA
Next July an expedition will spend
two months near Dubrovnik on the Adriatlol
Coast of Jugoslavia. As the party i s
a mixture of several Departments and
Years i t intends to carry out general
floral, faunal and geological surveys
of the region. Several ecological
problems w i l l be attempted and a collec-
tion of plant material w i l l be made for
the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew as well
as for the College Herbarium.
The party w i l l oonsist of the
following 10 people:-
Botany H
M. Stuart )
C.L. Ryan
Miss H.C. Tompsett
A.B. Snioer
Miss S. Burbedge )
R.G. Stickland)
Miss M. Woodbum Botany H I
P. Chen Zoology H
C. Welch Zoology I
G. Hawkins Geology II
This i s the first I.C. expedition
to visit a Communist country and they
would be grateful far any helpful
advioe or first hand knowledge of
Jugoslavian conditions.
BRITISH GUIANA
The organization of this expedition
was started during October of Last year
with the main aim of bringing back
recordings of tropical animals. These
will be both sound recordings, using
battery tape-machines, and visual records
by means of a colour cine film The
two w i l l be later superimposed to give
a sound-track to the film.
British Guiana was chosen as being
one of the nearer tropical regions under
British control and i 3 an area about
which very l i t t l e i s really known.
There will be 3 members in the
party - M.R. Honer, J.R. Pamell and
J.C. Taylor - a l l third year zoologists.
Their destination i s Imbaimadai on the
upper reaches of the Mazaruni River and
i t is hoped that the expedition w i l l
occupy a total of about 3 months.
The Exploration Board has provided
a grant of £100, and the B.B.C. seems
willing to provide equipment and advice.
AZORES
The application of the 1.0. Under-
water Cub to the Exploration Board for
support for i t s plans to visit the Azores
this sumner was successful.
As well as approval of the expedi-
tion, the Board gave a grant of £600.
Under the leadership of N.0. Cross-
land, Zoology III, a team of divers
will make a general collection of the
marine fauna near the island of Terceira.
The expedition has been fortunate in
that, the U.S.A.F. maintain a base on
this island and have offered daily
supplies of compressed air for the exped-
itions aqualungs.
Underwater photography w i l l be an
important part of the work with an
official expedition photogra^ner, a l -
though most of the party w i l l have their
own cameras. Thanks to a loan from the
Royal Geographical Society of the
necessary equipment, i t i s hoped to make
a cine film of the expedition.
Many marine biological institutes
and museums have already shown great
interest i n the expedition and are
helping as much as possible with advice
and equipment. The Portuguese author-
ities concerned with the Azores are
being most helpful to the Expedition.
The party w i l l consist of :-
- H.0. Crossland,
(Miss) CM. Brookes,
A. Berryman,
R.H.T. Gamett,
W.M.J. Paskin,
D. Lamberth,
D. Grey,
A. Larkin, and another member yet to be;
chosen.
JAN MAYEN
This is another expedition which
has applied to the Exploration Board
for approval of i t s plans. It is
intended to visit the island during the
summer to continue some of the work
done during the 1938 expedition.
Unfortunately the remote position of the
island ha3 caused transport difficulties,,
but the members of the expedition are
hoping for the best.
