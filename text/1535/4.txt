Widespread opposition from residents
St. Mary’s Hospital. New
home for Imperial medics?
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Debby Shorley, the Director of Li-
brary Services, has retired
She arrived at Imperial in 2007
and told Reporter, the College maga-
zine, that she “loved (almost!) every
minute of it.” She went on to say that
“Diﬀerent universities have diﬀerent
cultures, and the College has a real
indeﬁnable buzz about it”. During her
time she has campaigned for open ac-
cess to knowledge and says “I am cau-
tiously optimistic about the prospects
for more open access provision over
the next ﬁve years. In 20 years’ time I
think the model will be turned on its
head – I’m not sure quite how, but the
landscape will look very diﬀerent”.
She said that she will miss the work-
ing environment and praised her col-
leagues saying that she has “learned a
lot and watched some very clever peo-
action.
The backlash to the decision has
been remarkable. The ‘Save Charing
Cross’ campaign stated how the NHS
ignored 66,000 signatures of residents
on 18 petitions. Patient Donald Gray-
Raus said: “I am appalled by the idea
of closure of the A&E department at
Charing Cross Hospital. I am severely
disabled and the thought of not having
easy access to a hospital may be fatal
to me. Hammersmith & Fulham is too
large an area to be without a well-run
centrally located A&E department.”
Councillor Nicholas Botterill, Lead-
er of H&F Council, said: “We are
deeply upset at the result. The NHS
consultation was appalling and the
service level left available to residents
is appalling. This is bad news but there
are options available to us and we are
determined to see a hospital retained
at Charing Cross.”
The main worry is that the initial
closure of the A&E department and
stroke unit of Charing Cross hospital
will lead onto the eventual closure of
the hospital itself. Another worry is
the increase in ambulance journey
times to a predicted 53 minutes, which
could potential endanger lives. Resi-
dents are not satisﬁed with the idea
of the remaining A&E departments
accommodating for 400,000 people
which is around 50% more than the
national average.
Councillor Marcus Ginn, commu-
nity care leader, said: “We have been
warning of the threat to Charing Cross
hospital for many months and this
conﬁrms out worst fears.
“Over many months of questioning
on this, NHS bureaucrats have failed
to address concerns that this will leave
thousands of residents dangerously
distant from emergency care or to
show that lives will not be put at risk
by these closures.
“We will be ﬁghting tooth and nail
to save Charing Cross – the public are
not going to accept this plan quietly,
especially when the case for stripping
all the major service out of such a well
loved and respected centre of excel-
lence is not supported by evidence.
“They have not taken account of the
thousands on new homes being built
in west London which will mean we
need more local access to hospitals,
not less.
“We have warned them not to go
down this path. The public reaction is
going to be immense.”
The reasons behind these changes
have been linked with the massive
£1.8 billion deﬁcit that the NHS North
West London is trying to deal with. If
the Charing Cross Hospital A&E de-
partment is closed there will be a lot
more space for residential re-develop-
ment which the Imperial College NHS
Trust could sell for a large amount of
money.
However, Anne Rainsberry, NHS
NW London chief executive, said:
“The main proposal is to transform the
care provided in local communities.
More care should be delivered closer
to home. And by also centralizing
some specialist hospital-based ser-
vices, the NHS can ensure that people
can beneﬁt from receiving treatment
at centres of best practice and excel-
lence.
“This isn’t about cutting corners or
getting by with the bare minimum. We
want to change the way we deliver care
so that outcomes are improved, both
in terms of clinical outcomes and pa-
tient and staﬀ experiences.
“We’ve used robust clinical evidence
to set targets, and clinicians have set
out the standards by which we can
measure our performance against
them.”
The downgrade of Charing Cross
Hospital threatens the future of the
hospital as the teaching site for Impe-
rial College students. Charing Cross
Hospital is currently the main campus
for Imperial medical students but this
may be moved to St. Mary’s Hospital
in Paddington after the changes have
taken place.

that she will “appreciate not having

travel in from Brighton!”. She says that
she will now spend more time at her
house in Burgundy.
