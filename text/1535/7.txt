•A special offer for Imperial students
from Denis Smyth
•Driving Standards Agency (DSA)
Accredited Instructor
•Mock Test Examiner
5 Driving Lessons for
£95
"Denis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely
inexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test. He is
always calm and his comments are constructive; his knowledge of London and his
knack of engineering driving routes that test the learner make the lessons more than
worth it. Since I have met him he has shown a great desire to offer cheaper lessons to
Imperial students and with the backing of other students I am more than happy to
support him."

"I learned to drive in one of the busiest cities in the world. I passed first time. Would I
recommend Denis? Without hesitation."

Imperial’s got no SOLE?
Complete participation rates for SOLE released: a mixed bag
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Participation in SOLE shows that
Earth Sciences once again has 100%
participation rate, with the lowest be-
ing Biomedical Science at 34%.
Life Sciences also showed a disap-
pointingly low 48% turnout.
This year the Department of Earth
Sciences and Engineering piloted a
scheme where you could ﬁll out SOLE
on the Imperial Mobile App available
for smartphones.
Reasons to not ﬁll out the survey
range from apathy, not thinking peo-
ple will listen or care, not being both-
ered, and exams meaning people don’t
feel as though they have time to ﬁll out
the survey. There has also been the
suggestion of survey fatigue amongst
students.
Some Departments gave away prizes
as an added incentive. Chemical Engi-
neering and Aeronautical Engineer-
ing had a competition between years
with prizes. Evidence suggested this
worked to encourage students to ﬁll
out the survey as they had high par-
ticipation rate.
Medicine is more complex, and, in
general, had a very poor turnout.
The full results
With the SOLE survey being a way
for Imperial College and Departments
to gauge student opinion on lecturers
and the course, getting as high a pos-
sible turnout is key to improving the
course in line with students’ wants.
