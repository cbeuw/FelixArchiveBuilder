Charing Cross and Hammersmith
A&E departments are going to be
closed.
Following a public consultation last

the closure of the hyper-stroke unit of
Charing Cross Hospital.
Imperial College London, which is a

cised and was behind a login wall on
the website.
It will likely take about three years
for the plans to fully come into
