Our workload woes
s students of Imperial
College, we often regard
ourselves as some of the
hardest worked students
in the country. A quick
Google search reveals many students’
reviews of their time at Imperial. One
such review on a website called Wha-
tUni.com, which oﬀers advice to those
applying to University, from a former
Physics student says:
“The most important piece of advice
I can give you is that if you come to
Imperial you need to work HARD.”
Another review from a CivEng stu-
dent says:
“[The College] set so much work
for the sake of it, and really do not
care about you but instead only about
their own reputation... Way too much
work…”
Also,
“The boy girl [ratio] is a complete
joke. It is bad enough being at 68:32
but when you look at the standard of
girls you would cry”
But that’s for another article...
Are these damning reviews at all
true? We may spend the odd night too
many in the Library, but how do we
actually compare with the likes of Ox-
ford and Cambridge when looking at
compulsory work hours?
Arguably, as members of the Gold-
en Triangle (an unoﬃcial group of
the leading universities in the UK,
consisting of Oxford, Cambridge and
London-based universities including
Imperial and UCL), we should expect
contact hours, such as those spent in
lectures, to be roughly the same. Let’s
look at the average number of contact
hours per week for ﬁrst year students.
Surprisingly, for three of the four
subjects listed (Physics, Medicine and
Biology), Imperial has far fewer con-
tact hours than Oxbridge.
Physical Natural Scientists at Cam-
bridge have almost twice as many
contact hours as Physicists do at Im-
perial. Not only that, but both Oxford
and Cambridge have almost twice as
many lab hours. It could be said that
lab work is an incredibly important
part of a Physics degree and the tech-
niques learned in practical sessions
are incredibly valuable throughout
a physicist’s career, especially if they
continue on to do research. The thing
is, most ﬁrst year physicists at Impe-
rial, including myself, think that we
have too many lab hours each week
(perhaps the content, not the lab
hours, needs an overhaul). It’s not as if
our course is more theoretical either,
because both Oxbridge courses have
more lecture hours too.
Mathematicians at Imperial get a
slightly better deal, with the same
number of contact hours as those at
Oxford as well as more hours of lec-
tures than both other universities.
Cambridge students have four hours
of tutorials or ‘supervisions’ each week
whereas Imperial students only get
one hour. A ﬁrst year maths student
who studies at Imperial and wishes
to remain anonymous questions the
merits of tutorials however, “I think if
you have a good tutor they can be real-
ly helpful but sometimes I think tuto-
rials with older pupils might be more
helpful because they still remember
going through the process of learning
the concepts themselves.” About com-
puting sessions, which Cambridge
students miss out on, “They’re tricky
but quite interesting… if a little time
consuming.” Another maths student,
Eamonn Postlethwaite, agrees, “Even
though we have only two hours of
compulsory computing contact hours
a week, it’s probably the most individ-
ually time consuming one of our mod-
ules because of the nature and relative
diﬃculty of the coursework.”
Medicine is a similar story to Phys-
ics, with Oxbridge medics having
many more practical hours than those
at Imperial. However, unlike those at
Oxbridge, medics here get the chance
to meet patients in their ﬁrst year.
Lottie Whittingham, a ﬁrst year med-
ic at Imperial questions the beneﬁts of
this, “I’m not entirely convinced of the
value of seeing patients, other than for
motivation.” She is unperturbed how-
ever by the unequal practical hours, “I
think they’re more suited to a course
which frequently leads to research
rather than clinical practice… I don’t
think it makes you a more compe-
tent doctor, they are more just to aid
understanding.” Melanie Coates, an-
other medic, disagrees. She explains
why she believes patient interaction
is important, “It keeps all the science
and theory you’re doing in lectures
relevant to becoming a doctor.”
Biology, a traditionally lab-based
subject, suﬀers the same problems
that Physics does: very few lab hours
and tutorials. Ryan Cooke, a Biology
student, still ﬁnds that he has a lot of
work to do: “Note-taking is engulﬁng”
but questions whether a degree from
Imperial is really worth the high fees
when compared to Oxbridge, “I feel
cheated out of my £9000… and re-
lieved I don’t have that many hours
[as Cambridge] but cheated! A sour
breeze rolls over my relief!” Of course,
this opens up a whole other debate
about whether the high cost is justi-
ﬁed, but other factors such as employ-
ment prospects have to be considered.
When comparing the average num-
ber of contact hours to league table
rankings, we see that Cambridge,
topping the majority of lists, has the
highest average and Imperial, the bot-
tom of the three here, has the lowest.
Does that suggest that heads of fac-
ulties should revamp the timetables?
Does it mean that we actually don’t
have that much work? Well yes and
no. Contact hours are exactly as the
name suggests: we are in contact with
the lecturer/tutor/demonstrator and
we have to do some work, be it mak-
ing notes or performing experiments
(or at least turning up). But this is only
really half the story, how heavy some-
one’s workload is depends on how
much independent work they want to
do too not just how much time they
spend in lectures*.
Just to make you feel even worse, if
you still think you have a stupendous
amount of work to do, what about arts
students? James White, a Classics stu-
dent at Cambridge, has seven hours of
lectures & seven hours of supervisions
a week. Miriam Stoney, an Art His-
tory student at Oxford has only three
hours of lectures, one hour of classes
and an hour’s tutorial. She explains,
“My workload in comparison to the
scientists probably appears consider-
ably kinder, but I think the nature of
my degree demands a greater contri-
bution to introspection.”
James oﬀers an explanation to his
seemingly light timetable, “At ﬁrst
glance it may seem that science stu-
dents have a lot more work than arts
students but I think the amount of
work and reading that has to go into
some essays is sometimes underesti-
mated by science students. It took me
ﬁve hours to understand a chapter of a
book on my reading list.” Right James,
right...

*Disclaimer:
Of course, compulsory hours aren’t
completely representative of how much
work students at one university do over
students somewhere else. It depends
on the individual and how much they
put into doing lab reports or problem
sheets. Interviewing lots of people to
find out how much time they spend on
independent work would itself take an
age so that’s why I’ve only compared
contact hours. But in a sense, the work
you do independently is proportional
to the number of contact hours you
have, so this article isn’t a complete
waste of time.
