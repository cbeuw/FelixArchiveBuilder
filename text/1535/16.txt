n the 16th of December
last year while
Bangladesh celebrated
its 39th Victory Day and
Japanese voters brought
about a change in government, a
23-year-old physiotherapy student
was brutally raped and assaulted
in the Indian capital, New Delhi.
Within a week as news of the vicious
attack spread through the country, it
sparked widespread protest and cast
glaring light on what some call India’s
‘rape problem’.
While the woman and her boyfriend
were waiting at a bus stop in order to
return home after an evening show of
Life of Pi a passing private mini-bus
stopped and the couple boarded after
being informed that it was headed to
the same destination. After around
10 minutes the fellow passengers, all
inebriated males, started eve-teasing
and passing lewd comments at the
girl. When her boy friend objected, a
scuﬄe ensued with the men beating
him up with iron rods. While two of
them held on to the boy, the others
took turns at raping the girl. They
then assaulted the girl by inserting a
metal rod into her body and causing
irreparable damage to her intestines.
Both of them were then dumped on
a deserted road near the outskirts of
the city.
By the 21st of December, the rape
had caught the public imagination
leading to a mass protest at India
Gate and Raisana Hill, the location
of the Union Parliament and the
residence of the President. Relatively
peaceful earlier on, events took a turn
for the worse with the government
employing tear gas, lathi charges and
anti-terrorism laws to breakup the
protests. Several metro stations and
public transport services were also
shut down for a few day. Subsequent
clashes with the police lead to injuries
on both sides with a policeman dying
from cardiac arrest at the protest site.
Meanwhile the victim was being
treated at a hospital in Delhi and
remained in critical condition due to
damage and infection in her intestines
that had to be resected. On the 26th
of December, the government, based
on a cabinet meeting headed by the
PM, moved the victim to Mt. Mary
Hospital in Singapore for an intestinal
transplant. This decision to move
the patient while on life support was
criticized heavily in the media leading
to more protests, which had by now
spread to other major cities in the
country. On the 29th of December,
the victim succumbed to her injuries
and died of cerebral edema.
So far 6 men have been arrested
in connection with the vehicle,
including a 17 year old minor who
is alleged to have been the most
brutal of the accused, raping her
twice and ripping her intestines out
with his bare hands. After the death
of the victim, murder charges were
added to the other charges of rape,
kidnapping, destruction of evidence
and attempted murder. These charges
mean that the accused stand eligible
to receive the death penalty if found
guilty.
Taking cognisance of the protestors’
demands for harsher rape laws and
sterner action against sex oﬀenders
several state assemblies have tabled
amendments in state laws and
enforced measures such as the
creation of a dedicated help-line for
sexual abuse victims, and six “fast-
track courts” to deal with crimes
against women.
These protests come on the heels of
other protests against the beleaguered
central government, which has been
the target of several protests over the
last 18 months against corruption.
The heavy-handed reaction of the
government and the absence of any
early sympathetic response to the
protesters are likely causes for the
rapid intensiﬁcation of the protests.
The outpouring of public anger in the
cities is seen as a result of a rapidly
growing middle class revolting
against a misogynist and conservative
culture. Fundamentalist political

Tragedy sparks debate over attitudes to women
parties were quick to blame the rape
on the westernization of Indian
women and these reactions appear to
have spurred the protests yet further.
Itisnow63yearssinceIndiaadopted
a constitution promising democracy,
justice and equality of religion, race,
caste, sex and place of birth, and yet
its justice system remains plagued
with widespread corruption among
the police and judicial oﬃcers. Police
oﬃcers are often seen as oppressors
of the general public and guardians of
the ruling political class. Notorious for
being un-safe for women, the capital
New Delhi was recently branded the
‘rape capital’ of the country by its
own Chief Minister. Crimes against
women appear in the newspapers
with frightening regularity and
include rape, dowry related abuse,
marital abuse and eve teasing. Police
ﬁgures show a rape reported on
average every 18 hours and reported
rape cases rose by nearly 17 percent
between 2007 and 2011.
It is in this environment that a fast-
growing educated middle class, at war
with a patriarchal and male chauvinist
tradition, has seized the brutal gang-
rape and murder of a young student
to raise awareness and international
attention to India’s ‘rape problem’.
With statements from UN Secretary
General Ban Ki Moon and the
governments of France, the USA and
others, the issue has certainly gained
international notoriety; whether this
results in any real legal and societal
progress in the country remains to be
seen.
63 years since India adopted
a constitution promising
democracy, justice and
equality of religion, race,
caste, sex and place of birth...
its justice system remains
plagued with widespread
corruption...

Key Stories from the Holiday Season
Italian Elections Heat Up
On the 9th of December Mario Monti,
Italy’s “technocrat” leader, stepped
down amid a boycott by Berlusconi’s
Freedom People party over budget
decisions. Appointed after Berlusconi
lost his parliamentary majority and
resigned amongst personal scandals,
Monti’s government was tasked with
balancing Italy’s books before stepping
down this April; his early resignation has
pushed the Italian elections forward to
February..
Silvio Berlusconi had already
confirmed his intention to run for a
fourth term in upcoming elections,
but it remained uncertain what Monti
would do; this was mirrored in the
markets, with fears over Italy becoming
“the detonator that could blow up the
eurozone”.
Now it’s been announced that Monti
will run supported by a coalition of
centrist parties under the name “Monti’s
Agenda for Italy”, though as a result of
his austerity policies the group currently
trail far behind Pier Bersani’s centre-left
Democratic Party.
Syria Conflict Deepens
The Syrian conflict remains decidedly
unresolved, now being deemed an all
out civil war. Recent estimates from the
UN have put the total death toll from the
conflict at 60,000 since it began some 22
months ago, as much as half of which are
estimated to be civilian deaths. Ten times
as many people are now registered as
refugees in neighbouring countries.
Many cities such as Aleppo and
Homs remain the site of intense
fighting between government forces
and the increasingly internationally
accepted National Coalition of Syrian
Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.
However the vast majority of the capital,
Damascus, is still held by forces loyal
to Bashar Al-Assad, save the suburb of
Douma held by rebels since October
18th.
Europe Debate Rolls On
Here in the UK, debate over the
country’s role in the European Union
and single-market has continued at a
low key rumble. David Cameron is due
to announce his ‘action plan’ on Europe
in weeks. But he has been warned by
various figures including the Obama
Administration that withdrawal
would risk damaging the UK’s political
significance and economic power. An In/
Out referendem seems unlikely, but it’s
possible Britain will push to renegotiate
it’s “role” within the union. How that will
be received by other members remains
to be seen.
