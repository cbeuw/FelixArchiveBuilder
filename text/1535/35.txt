This week you have more stu-
dent loan! However, after shop-
ping in Whole Foods for a week
it is all gone again – you have to
live off plain pasta all term and
your brain shrivels up from lack
ofnutrients.Inadesperatemea-
sure, you cut your arm off and
cook it in your toastie maker. But
you can’t quite bring yourself to
eat it and die of starvation.
This week, you develop an ir-
rational attachment to Gilson
pipettes. You smuggle a p1000
out of the lab, lovingly caress
its shaft, and even buy it a vel-
vet cushion so it can sleep next
to you with your head nuzzled
against the tip ejector. Howev-
er, while you sleep it jabs you
in the eye and escapes back
to the lab. You are heartbroken.
This week you have finished ex-
ams :D !!! You are really looking
forward to a weekend off, with
sometimetoreintegrateyourself
into society following revision
exile. However, your lecturer de-
cides to put the first lectures for
your next module on Saturday,
and sets a coursework deadline
for Monday. I hope you don’t
think you deserved a break.
This week you’ve been steal-
ing your housemate’s shower
gel, thinking they won’t no-
tice. Unfortunately for you,
they craftily replace the gel
with hair removal cream. After
your next shower, you look in
the mirror and realise you are
completely bald – all over. Let
that be a lesson to you all, you
stingy twats. Pint?
This week Venus is aligned
with Saturn, which is a sure
sign that this term you are go-
ing to have loads of course-
work, develop rickets from
sunlight deficiency, get re-
jected by your crush, get 10
bike punctures, and spend
Valentine’s Day alone again.
The planets never lie; it’s go-
ing to be another great term.
This week you get the biggest
rejection of all. Oxbridge. Nah,
just kidding. You got that ages
ago. Looking at how well your
exams went last term, it’s prob-
ably a good thing you didn’t
get in. Things are on the up as
the sexiest thing you’ve ever
seen is dancing near to you.
They push you away, saying “I
only like Cambridge boys”.
This week you won’t fucking
stop sniffing in the Library in
the QUIET AREA. Nobody
wants to hear your cold loudly
played out while trying to re-
member random shit we’ll
never need to know. You end
up being a passed a note that
simply reads “sniff this please
- signed everyone” containing
anthrax. People are mean.
This week you fall in love with
a test tube. It just fits so snugly
around your warm genitals.
Ohhhh yeah. Your love affair
blooms and soon you just can’t
get enough of each other. You
get stuck and have to go to the
emergency room. You have a
10 hour wait and nothing to eat
but your ejaculate. You decide
you’veeatenworseintheLibrary
This week you go collecting
money for charity hoping that
good karma will neglect the
lack of writing on your exam
script. You whore your body
out, but it turns out nobody
wants it and even medical
research turns you down with
the doctor performing the
study saying “it’s not you, it’s
me, I like you as a friend”.
This week you look to the
heavens for the answers. Un-
fortunately, someone found
the paper that you hid on the
ceiling and you’re now in the
shit for cheating unless you
can pull off pretending to have
an incredibly strong twitch in
your neck. Turns out you’re not
a good actor, and you’re defi-
nitely doing resits.
This week revision and high-
high-
lighting all of your notes
lighting all of your notes has
made you a crazy person who
must highlight everything. All
work and no highlighting makes
Jack a DULL DULL BOY. Will
page 5 of lecture handout 6 be
crucial. WILL IT. ANSWER ME.
Maybe they’ll double bluff and
use something from the first
lecture. No-one revises that.
This week you have to choose
betweenswimmingacrossalake
ofcolostrumorhaving100raisins
crammed up your bum. Both are
nutritious options; the colostrum
would go great with your ce-
real but might be a bit fatty, while
goodness from the raisins could
infuse through the lining of your
anal passage but might get quite
sticky. What’s it going to be?
