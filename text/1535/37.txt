In case you forgot them over Christmas,
here are the rules. You need to draw a sin-
gle closed loop by joining the dots (not di-
agonally!) so that the numbered squares are
surrounded by the corresponding number
of lines.
FUCWIT is resetting this term, so keep send-
ing your answers to puzzles.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk.
The numbers show you how
many groups of black squares
are in a row or column, as well
as how many black squares
each group consists of. Filling
in the grid produces a pretty
picture.

Connect all the islands with
bridges so that you can get
from any island to any other
one. There are restrictions,
though: the bridges have to
be either vertical or horizonal
and they must not intersect.
You can have up to two bridg-
es between any two islands
and, last but not least, each
island must have exactly as
many bridges as the number
on it states.
If a knight says “I believe that X”, X must be true, because if he is sane, he does believe X and
what he believes is true, and if he is insane, he believes ‘not X’, but what he believes is false.
Similarly, if a knight says “I believe that I believe that X”, if he is sane, X must be true, but if he
is insane, X must be false, since he doesn’t believe that he believes X, which from the above
means that X is false. The above holds for an odd or an even number of “I believe that”s, re-
spectively.So,thefirstinmateensuresthattheheadissane.Thesecondinmatecanbeeither
insane or sane, but assuming he is sane leads us to a contradiction, because the statement
of the inmate behind him means he is insane. So he must be insane. Thus, we can proceed
in pairs (1-2, 3-4, ...), all of whom are sane-insane, and also deduce that the 99th inmate is
sane. This, along with the head’s statement, means that the horrible conclusion Craig came
to was that, apart from the head doctor, all the doctors in the asylum were insane and all the
inmates sane!
