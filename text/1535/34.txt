A T-shirt from Sammy sayin ‘I’m not
conservative in the bedroom ;)’. It
actually has the wink face as well.

M type.

No, it’s all her. She’s fucked up. She
told me to piss in her mouth and call
her Cleggman.
E
ccentric global entrepre-
neur Santa Claus has ﬁled
for bankrupcy and put his
company “Christmas In-
dustries Ltd” into admin-
istration.
This follows on from a very diﬃ-
cult holiday period in which he faced
problems from high demand from
children as well as declining belief
due to kids becoming sceptical little
shitbags.
This holiday season more people
on Earth were on Earth. This meant
that he had more work than ever be-
fore. However, many children had
stopped asking him for presents as
they realised that their parents hand-
writing looks suspiciously similar to
Mr Christmas’ and that they thought
they saw their dad creep downstairs
last year.
Christmas Industries Ltd also suf-
fered a major scandal when the con-
ditions and pay of the elves were
revealed by the Guardian, with the
Daily Mail latter picking up the story.
The widespread coverage saw unprec-
edented industry action by the elves
who demanded payment and to be
allowed to wear diﬀerent clothes. Mr
Claus is also currently on trial for the
mistreatment of animals and a suit is
being ﬁled by Mr Rudolf of the North
Pole claiming that Santa ignored him
until his nose became an asset. Mr
Rudolf has also said that Mr Claus
“knew of the bullying and alienation
that I was being subjected to. He just
stood there and laughed in his trade-
mark jolly manner. That Comet and
Dasher are nasty pieces of work, de-
spite their placid image they project.”
Santa was also controversially ar-
rested after CCTV evidence showed
that he has been pioleting a ﬂying sled
whilst under the inﬂuence of thou-
sands of glasses of alcohol, with the
oﬃcer at the scene saying the breath-
alyser blew up when he was tested.
Mr Claus has denied all accusations
and has pledged to ﬁght them all. He
has also lashed out at Amazon and
other online retailers for stealing his
elves work. He continued with “Seri-
ously, Apple and Samsung are ruin-
ing local businesses like mine. How
are my elves supposed to make as so-
phisticated devices as a smartphone?
Do you think I have the resources to
invest in that kind of research and de-
velopment?” Mr Claus also denied the
drink driving charge.
Fresher resorts to Facebook rather than
terrible clubs in latest bid to find love
Hisfriendsare
reported to be
“more inventive
than just typing
‘I’m gay’ as his
status”.

it was a body double

I think she might need some coun-
selling.

Nah, she’s right. It is sort of better
when she looks like Cleggman
