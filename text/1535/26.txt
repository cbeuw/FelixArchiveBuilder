Is South Park going south?
Maximilian Eggl gets animated about the latest season
ike it or not, South Park
is a cultural phenomenon,
often quoted, reminisced
about or each episode
carefully dissected. The
fact that South Park just ﬁnished its
16th season does nothing to lessen its
appeal; in fact the show has now been
extended to ﬁnish in 2016 bringing it
to 20 seasons.
The 16th season ﬁnished on the
7th of November, and the reviews are
mixed. There was some good as well
as some bad. Here are my opinions of
the latest season.
The ﬁrst half of the season overall
was somewhat disappointing. On
ﬁrst viewing of almost all episodes I
either was confused at the story line
or disappointed at the missed oppor-
tunities for great and memorable epi-
sodes. “Reverse Cowgirl”, the season’s
opener about an apparent need for
toilet safety and an attempt to sue the
dead, parodied the security checks in
airports (which was quite ﬁtting) as
well as the US legal system. It was a
promising start and it did have some
funny moments, however it will not
be a South Park classic so to speak.
That summary can be applied to most
of the other episodes of the ﬁrst half
– “Faith Hilling”, “Cash For Gold” and
“Butterballs” all had very promising
beginnings, but either ﬁzzled out
quietly or ended on an incomplete
note. The most memorable in this
set of episodes was “I Should Never
Have Gone Ziplining”. Parodying the
adventure/reality documentaries that
usually run on the Discovery Chan-
nel, History Channel etc., it featured
an extended scene in which Cartman,
Kyle, Stan and Kenny were all acted
out in live-action. While not adding
anything in particular to the plot, it
is a memorable moment in the sea-
son as all of a sudden you see actors
in the place of your favourite cartoon
characters.
The second half of the season was
markedly better, with the majority of
episodes impressing on the ﬁrst view-
ing. Here, the real deﬁning episodes
of the season were revealed. “Rais-
ing the Bar”, dealing with the whole
Honey Boo-Boo situation and with
James Cameron saving the day, was
almost perfect, hitting exactly the
right places. “Insecurity” tapped into
the Batman mania that surrounded
that time. I chuckled quite regularly
during that episode, and must say it
is vying for a place for my favourite
with the previous episode mentioned.
All the other episodes, bar “A Scause
for Applause,” were of that same high
standard and in my regard, restored
South Park to its high pedestal, from
which it had fallen during the ﬁrst
few episodes. The last episode of the
season – “Obama Wins!” – was the
perfect ending for a much improved
set of episodes. Hailed the best epi-
sode of the season (which I agree
with), it deals with the US presiden-
tial race and in a stroke of genius ties
it in with the purchase of Star Wars
by Disney (starring the absolutely
phenomenal Mickey Mouse).
All in all this season of South Park,
while not one of the best, is one of
the better ones, mainly thanks to
the strength of the latter episodes.
These later seasons do not have the
great plots of earlier episodes, how-
ever their success in dealing with
current issues is astounding. Gener-
ally with this season and other recent
episodes, I found on second viewing
that even the ﬁrst half of the season
was enjoyable. This may be attributed
to the fact that once I knew that the
plot really wasn’t going anywhere, I
could focus on the jokes within the
episode itself. South Park is a show
that is at times very random, and so
perhaps I should have expected this
from the start. However one thing I
did not like about this season, is the
apparent change in the character of
Cartman. Cartman used to be the kid
you just loved to hate. Nowadays he
just seems to have lost his touch; in
fact he gets quite friendly with Kyle
and even seems to follow some kind
of moral code. This is not the Cart-
man I love watching, maybe he will
come back again. Nevertheless let us
hope for the future that Trey Parker
and Matt Stone do not lose their
touch and keep churning out enter-
taining television.
L
Doctor Who is a contentious show.
It is praised by some critics for its
great imagination and the inﬂuence
it has had on other SF programming.
Others claim that it has never really
gone beyond its original concept as a
‘family show’ – a term seen by many
as a euphemism for ‘children’s pro-
gramme’. Not that these opposing
points of view are mutually exclusive
– a major London fan group recently
voted Doctor Who the worst SF show
of 2012 while at the same time pro-
claiming its leads the best genre tel-
evision actors of the year. I have much
the same attitude myself, having pre-
viously said on pages that I believe the
show’s episodes can be split up into
three categories – a third of them are
brilliant, a third are just plain disap-
pointing while a third are so bad that
they’re good. I had, however, found
all the episodes in the ﬁrst half of the
latest series, broadcast earlier in the
year, surprisingly enjoyable so I had
high hopes going into this Christmas
special. Unfortunately, as I was soon
to ﬁnd out, ‘The Snowmen’ lies ﬁrmly
in the ‘disappointing’ category.
The episode begins an indetermi-
nate amount of time after the end of
‘The Angels Take Manhattan’ – with
the Doctor, still grieving for the loss
of Amy and Rory, living the life of a
recluse in Victorian London. How-
ever, the return of old enemy the
Great Intelligence and the appear-
ance of the mysterious Clara, looking
suspiciously like Oswin Oswald – the
woman turned into a Dalek who was
killed at the end of ‘Asylum of the
Daleks’ – soon convince the Doctor
to come out of his early retirement.
There was nothing particularly
wrongwiththestory–itwasjust,well,
painfully average. Using the Great
Intelligence as the antagonist meant
that there were plenty of references
for fans of the Second Doctor and
old Doctor allies Strax and Madame
Vastra make a welcome return but
the episode itself was just a repeat
of the same tropes and cli-
chés that I’ve seen in Doc-
tor Who and in countless
other SF shows dozens of
times. Perhaps the show’s
creators thought that a
safe, uninspiring episode
with a cookie cutter plot was
just the thing for audiences
who had just ﬁnished their
Christmas dinner and
were unlikely to be paying
full attention to the episode
but for someone who’s seen
as much genre television as
I have it was just boring.
The best thing about
the episode was the introduction of
the Doctor’s new companion, Clara.
Intelligent, adventurous and witty,
she seems the perfect addition to the
show. She also has a very in-
triguing ability, which looks
like it will dominate the
story arc of rest of the se-
ries – whenever she dies
she seems to be reborn in
some diﬀerent period of
time. For a while it even
seemed that the Doc-
tor was ﬁnally going to
have a companion form
a time period other than
our own, until the episode’s
coda revealed that it was a
present day version of Clara
that would be travelling with
the Doctor. Still, I am looking
forward to seeing more of her
when Doctor Who returns in
April.
OMG they keep making shitty episodes. YOU BASTARDS
Dr Who is coming to town
