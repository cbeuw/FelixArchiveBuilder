Big Brother... On Mars?
ars One is a not-
for-proﬁt organi-
sation planning to
use money donated
from sponsors and
that generated from a reality TV show
‘media storm’ to fund a project that
will put a human habitat on Mars in
2023. In the ﬁrst half of this year the
application process will open to ap-
plications for their astronaut training
program, which itself will be ﬁlmed
and broadcast as part of the TV show.
Mars One claim to have already re-
ceived over 1000 emails expressing
interest in signing up for the project,
regardless of the catch: the trip to
Mars will be one way.
With the goal of reducing
the costs of funding such
a project the outgoing
astronauts will live
and die on Mars. The
organisation has not
ruled out the pos-
sibility that a return
trip may become
feasible at some
point in the future,
but for the moment
the trip remains one way.
This means that the habitats
on Mars will have to be self-
sustaining, with planned hydroponic
farming and water and oxygen extrac-
tion from the soil being essential for
the astronauts’ survival.
The habitats, components,
and other essentials for
the settlement will
be transported
and set up in
various stag-
es, with the
majority of
preparations
taking place
before the as-
tronauts reach
Mars. The organ-
isation will send
a communications
satellite, necessary for
beaming the live feeds of the habitat
back to Earth for the television show,
whilst also allowing communication
“”between the settlers and people back
on Earth. Shipments and rovers will
also be sent over, with the rovers ﬁnd-
ing the best place for habitation, then
moving the supplies there and setting
up the base of the human settlement,
ready for the astronauts.
Once the astronauts arrive they will
have to make some ﬁnal adjustments
to the habitat, maybe dust oﬀ some so-
lar cells and then they will be ready to
move in and be watched by the world.
Some components and supplies will
arrive on Mars shortly after the ar-
rival of the astronauts and, after this
initial batch, new astronauts, supplies
and components will arrive every two
years, expanding the habitat further.
All of this process will be televised
24/7/365, from the astronaut training
program to a live-feed from the rovers
on Mars; even the historic moment
of the ﬁrst person to set foot on Mars
will be captured for the viewing pub-
lic. As beﬁts a reality TV show pub-
lic interaction will also play a part in
the show, with the public being able
to choose which team of 4 will be the
ﬁrst to be sent to Mars. That is, if the
project ever gets there.
There are many dangers that will be
faced by a project such as this. There
could be any number of technical
problems that simply couldn’t be ﬁxed
by a normal person, or even disasters
that could kill all of the crew. There’s
also a danger that funds could dry
up if the project’s media storm didn’t
sustain momentum, leaving the astro-
nauts abandoned on Mars.
The website for the project ad-
dresses some of these issues, such as
the plan to cover the habitats on Mars
with soil, reducing radiation received
by the people whilst on Mars. The
shielding of the main capsule of the
spacecraft for periods of violent solar
activity is another plan to reduce the
risk to the astronauts from radiation.
This gives me hope that the project
team have at least some idea of the
dangers and that the project could ac-
tually achieve its goal.
The project, if successful, would be a
testament to human ingenuity, paving
the way for likeminded projects, and
who knows what projects like these
could end up achieving. Maybe one of
them will even manage to solve some
of our problems down here on Earth.
The major issue faced is how people
will be evicted from the show

Fund cancer research, gain immortality. Maybe.
Laurence Pope Science Editor
Ad5[CgA-E1A-miR122]PTD isn’t a
catchy name. But, for just one million
pounds, Ad5[CgA-E1A-miR122]PTD
(Ad5 for short) could be renamed —
after you.
But why would anyone want this
seemingly pointless honour? A Swed-
ish research team modiﬁed Ad5, a basic
adenovirus, so that it ‘eats cancer’
. More
accurately, it speciﬁcally targets and
kills neuroendocrine tumours (NETs),
cancers arising from the hormonal
(endocrine) and the nervous systems.
However, lack of funding means that
the virus remains untested in humans.
What would this mean for potential
sponsors? Either your name would be-
come known worldwide (‘I got a dose
of the Romney today. Never felt bet-
ter!’), or relegated to the footnotes of
obscure scientiﬁc papers if the research
ﬂops.
But why isn’t it attracting more fund-
Steve Jobs died following complica-
tions relating to a pancreatic neu-
roendocrine tumour. Apple have so
far not offered any funding.
ing? Allegedly because it won’t bring in
much money for biotech companies,
due to much of the research being pub-
lic and therefore unpatentable. Hence,
little potential return. In theory. In real-

ity a little modiﬁcation to make it more
oncogenically lethal or speciﬁc and a
patent could be feasibly granted.
The main reason funding is not forth-
coming is likely the reduced interest in
gene therapy for cancers, following the
death of 18 year old Jesse Gelsinger
after injection of the adenovirus being
trialled. Coupled with the diﬃculty of
virus modiﬁcation and the requirement
for the virus to destroy every cancer
cell whilst not killing your own results
in a cancer therapy sponsors shy away
from. It doesn’t help either that NETs
are rare cancers to begin with.
Where is this research likely to head?
Considering the media storm whipped
up by the story someone will likely
come along and cough up the dough
for a chance of immortality. Whether
this will fuel further funding in ex-
change for having cures named after
sponsors — and how ethical this is — is
another question entirely.
