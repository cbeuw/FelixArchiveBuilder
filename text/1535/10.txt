Highlight EVERYTHING
Caroline Wood on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of studying
his week many of you will
have been camping out in
the Library preparing for
exams. (I feel your pain.)
This is the ﬁrst time in 4
years that I am not sitting exams this
January (ﬁst punch) and so instead of
frantic cramming I’ve taken some time
to look into some of the best, and the
worst, revision techniques. (Once a
nerd...)
It’s two days before your ﬁrst exam.
As the last minute panic starts to set
in, what is your weapon of choice for
ensuring you get the content from
those last few lecture slides oﬀ of the
page and into your head? Many of
us are guilty of turning to the trusty
highlighter. Bland lecture notes are
transformed into a sea of ﬂuorescent
yellow, green and pink as we pray that
the technicolour page will imprint it-
self on our minds. The hope is this can
then jump from our head to the exam
paper. However, in new research pub-
lished this Wednesday by the Associa-
tion for Psychological Science (and re-
ported on by TIME magazine), it has
now been proved that highlighting is
one of the most ineﬀective methods
of study for most people. (I could have
told you that based on my 2nd year
exam results, but now it’s “scientiﬁ-
cally proven” and “all oﬃcial”.)
To all those serial highlighting of-
fenders out there: read on to ﬁnd out
how to go from cramming zero to
cramming hero. This is a guide to the
good, the bad and the ugly of studying
techniques.
The Good
You envy the person who takes revi-
sion in their stride. (Or maybe you
are that person, in which case – con-
gratulations!) But with these few tips
you should breeze through your stud-
ies like you are as cool as Vanilla Ice
(baby).
The study reports that there is a
“cheats” way of learning very large
quantities of challenging material in a
very short time. A method never be-
fore known outside the psychology lab
has now been revealed.
OK, I just made that up. Sorry. In
reality, the result of the study is un-
derwhelmingly expected. One of the
most eﬀective methods reported is
called “distributed practice”. Basi-
cally this is a fancy term that means
studying over a long period of term.
Yep, covering lecture notes during the
term and then re-covering them at
regular intervals has been proved to
be one of the most eﬀective methods
of study. Cramming gets a big thumbs
down. Hardly surprising.
But wait a second. Before you start
heading over to your tutor’s oﬃce to
quit your degree, there is a dim light
at the end of the gloomy studying tun-
nel. The second best learning strategy
is what the authors call “practice test-
ing”. This means that recalling infor-
mation from memory is conducive
to learning. Eﬀectively, all those past
papers are actually worth while! Yesss!
Another method that can help
“practice testing” is the use of ﬂash-
cards –as you are forced to recall in-
formation from memory. And in yet
more good news, if getting all arts
and crafts and making ﬂash cards is
not your style you’ll be pleased to hear
that there are now digital app versions
of ﬂash cards such as Quizlet, Study-
Blue and FlashCardMachine. Pretty
sweet.
The Bad
You know the bad already. You just
don’t want to admit that you know. I’ll
make it short and painless. Things not
to do when studying:
1. Reading
2. Underlining
3. Re-reading
4. Highlighting
5. Summarising
Of course these methods may work
for some people. But in general, high-
lighting can draw you attention to spe-
ciﬁc facts and decrease your ability to
draw connections between diﬀerent
areas. Reading, I assume, can be good
for some people. However half read-
ing, half day-dreaming about what
you’re going to do after exams have
ﬁnished is probably not ideal. It may
be a bit surprising that summarising is
on this list of what not to do. An of-
ten endorsed method is shunned by
the authors of the report as they claim
that there are more eﬀective ways to
best utilise study time. You got told.
The Ugly
To say these techniques are ugly is
slightly misleading. They are actually
the techniques that are not especially
eﬀective, but not completely crap. But
the good, the bad and the medium
doesn’t have quite the same ring to it
so here goes: the ugly.
Visual learning or using mental im-
agery has been dubbed ‘alright’. It can
be eﬀective but it’s also quite time
consuming and is, of course, only use-
ful for things you can visualise. Wave
goodbye to this method for your
quantum modules...
Elaborative interrogation is another
complex term used that has quite a
simple meaning: question everything.
Continuously ask yourself ‘why’ ques-
tions as you study so you check you
understand where everything comes
from. This sounds great in theory.
However the likely outcome is that
you will discover you have no idea
why you assume x is positive and sub-
sequently realise you don’t even know
what x represents before deciding to
“just accept it”.
Self-explanation, or forcing yourself
to explain the text in detail instead of
passively reading it over can be good.
This comes with a caution: eﬀective-
ness depends on how complete and
accurate your explanations are. High
risk – high reward strategy?
Finally, the keyword mnemonic. You
associate new vocabulary with other
words in imaginative ways. For exam-
ple when learning the French word for
key, “la clef,” you can imagine a key
on top of a cliﬀ. (Example curtesy of
TIME magazine.) Good luck associat-
ing something with “macromolecu-
lar structure determination by X-ray
crystallography or solution nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy”.
Most of these techniques require a
high time:learning ratio. They can be
eﬀective but when you have 8 mod-
ules to learn in 8 days they are pretty
much a no go.
So there you have it. Two tips to
exam success! Go over your lecture
notes and give ﬂashcards a chance.
Happy revision and good luck if you
still have exams this January!
