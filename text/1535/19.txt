FRIDAY 11 JANUARY
people to achieve their goals but I feel
the organisers were stepping out of
their remit and the spirit of rational-
ism here. The idea that success can be
aided by imagining how great it would
be to lose those pounds, get that job
or kiss that girl is only one philoso-
phy and not only is it not supported
by evidence, the evidence actively op-
poses it. This unscientiﬁc approach
was further highlighted by choosing
a Steiner school as the host venue
for the meeting. This was not a co-
incidence. I raised this with Sander-
son Jones afterwards who said that
a Steiner school was what they had
initially sought, the fact that this one
was in an old church building was just
a happy coincidence. This is no small
matter. Steiner schools promote ho-
meopathy among their pupils and do
not provide inoculations, which puts
children’s health at great risk.
Then we came slightly closer to a
proper prayer. Sanderson got us to
shout “Life is good” and “Life is great”,
again with the reasoning that sim-
ply saying this would have a positive
impact on us. But ignoring the lack
of psychological evidence here, I’m
not sure I agree with this. You see,
life isn’t necessarily good. Really shit
things can happen and we need to see
them for that. If atheists are to adopt
the stance that “life is good” then we
make ourselves no better than those
who slavishly repeat “God is good” as
a hurricane bears down on them. An
important part of maturity, I feel, is
accepting that shit happens so make
the most of the good stuﬀ. Blind
“hope” is simply an atheist’s version
of blind faith and equally ﬂawed. Bah
humbug.
Should interest in pseudo-science
continue, The Sunday Asssembly will
not ﬁnd me or many other rational-
ists in its numbers. However, I have
hope. This was just the ﬁrst session of
what is hoped to become a permanent
monthly ﬁxture. There is room for
discussion and change, as the organ-
izers themselves stressed throughout.
Being comedians, the organisers have
done a great job of creating a fun, live-
ly atmosphere which will be a big sell-
ing point for the services. But no one
could expect them to be ‘all things to
all men’. They may not know about the
research behind so-called ‘self help’ or
of the beliefs of Steiners. As they gath-
er momentum and interest and take
on more voices, there is no reason to
think that the Assembly can’t change.
Here’s hoping they will.
Leaving the service, I, and most of
the godless congregation, were struck
by a bolt of irony as a real, bona ﬁde
Christian church service was going on
in the hall next door from an African
evangelical congregation. So how dif-
ferent was our service to this, the ‘real
thing’? And what is it that will make
those who actively oppose one join in
the other? The atheist church needs
to provide the good stuﬀ of regular
church with none of the bad stuﬀ of
irrational belief or evangelical zeal.
My verdict from the ﬁrst day? It’s on
the right track. I and most attendees
left the service feeling a little happier
about life – we certainly had a good
time. The idea of sermons is a posi-
tive one, but may need more focus on
a message than making people laugh.
Hymns were fun and the reﬂection
time may have a purpose but they
should be sensitive to those who may
be made uncomfortable by the reli-
gious overtones. The ‘self help’ style
stuﬀ should be toned down and not
central to the service. The connec-
tion with the Steiner school should
be seriously questioned. But I do feel
that The Sunday Assembly could well
be the start of a great thing. I left the
place like most did, feeling like I’d
enjoyed myself and encouraged to
be around like minded people inter-
ested in exploring and celebrating
life. Sanderson and Pippa make for a
great team – what they need are more
voices on board. Sciencey people, arty
people, philosophy-y people – people
to give the church a wider vision and
a wider appeal. There are improve-
ments to be made but I’d like to be a
part of those improvements. London
now has its ﬁrst atheist church. In
time, I think I might just be a convert.

itting at my desk, slaving
over acres and acres of
lecture slides, I hear the
familiar two-tone emerg-
ing from my laptop. An
email has arrived. I hurry to check it,
eager to escape the dull monotony of
work. ‘Dear Student, Please note that
SOLE is open for evaluating...’ Aaar-
gh! Delete the email, and continue
working...
The endless SOLE emails are a
nuisance for most people, who have
lots of things going on with their
lives, and no-one seems to want to/
have time to respond. We’ve all been
there. It’s completely understandable.
Until recently, I was thinking the
very same thing. Then, on the last day
of term, I had the chance to have a
chat with my Faculty’s Head of Qual-
ity Assurance and Enhancement. He
lamented that the rate of response to
SOLE questionnaires was low, but
what struck me was what he said
next: “How can the Faculty possibly
change anything, if they don’t know
what the students think is going bad-
ly!”
Now a signiﬁcant number of people
will respond to this saying: a) Their
Faculty does not do anything even if
complaints are registered; b) Their
Faculty has a laissez-faire ‘We don’t
care’ attitude towards students (or c)
Their faculty actually has done some-
thing good after receiving a com-
plaint, but we’ll get onto that later).
Our apathy seems to be inherent
in many areas. Turnout for Student
Union Elections for Postgrads and
Undergrads, were 19% and 58% re-
spectively this year (we were the best
in the country!). That’s still a huge
number of people abstaining from
their right to inﬂuence their quality
of education. Considering that our
degrees are our ticket into working
life, I ﬁnd this ‘lack of interest’ shock-
ing.
I have to ask: why is there such a
‘lack of interest’ in our own educa-
tion? Being a medic, I feel best placed
to talk about some of the problems
that we have been having. The over-
riding feeling is that we feel com-
pletely and utterly uncared for by the
Faculty, as highlighted by Imperial’s
recent problems with Student Satis-
faction. There just does not appear to
be any help or support readily avail-
able from the Faculty, contributing to
the sense of apathy felt by students.
There is very little academic help
forthcoming to students who may
be struggling with the rigours of the
course. There is no help oﬀered to in-
ternational students, for things such
as accommodation, in the event that
they have a resit. There is no help for
the travel costs between the various
campuses and hospitals that we are
required to be at, which is inherently
unfair on poorer students.
For our problems, we have to rely
mostly upon our excellent Union,
most of whom have volunteered to
do the job and are working on a shoe-
string budget. In my view, it is com-
pletely unfair to burden the Union
with jobs the Faculty is being paid by
us to do.
No wonder levels of apathy are so
high!
But the Faculty can and has
changed things for the better. For
example, we received a lecture for
which the lecturer did not cover the
learning objectives set out, and did
not even appear to know what was
on his own lecture slides. There was
a lot of dissatisfaction amongst the
300-odd people sitting in the lecture
hall, which was immediately made
known to the Faculty. Within a very
short period of time, they sent out a
response, apologising for what had
happened and the action they would
take to remedy the issue.
The key here (unlike the other times
I have protested) was that a vast
proportion of those aﬀected, com-
plained! The Faculty simply had no
choice but to respond! In many cases,
the curriculum has been changed as a
response to large amounts of collec-
I was going to write a column on apathy...
Alok Prasad is tired of our lackadaisical attitude
tive student feedback.
The higher the number of people
giving feedback, the more obliged
the Faculty is to change things! Low
response rates ﬂy in the face of the
fact that each one of us is investing a
substantial amount of time and mon-
ey (especially international students)
into pursuing a qualiﬁcation here at
Imperial.
We have to collectively be vocal in
our views to make a diﬀerence. Write
more emails, do more SOLE, talk
with your Year Reps!
We are paying customers of Impe-
rial College London and it’s about
time that we demand the service that
we deserve.
