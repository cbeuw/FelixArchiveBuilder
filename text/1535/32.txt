New Year’s 2048x1152
Ross Webster reallycouldn’tpassuponthatjoke.Sorry.
ith the Steam
sales now over,
it’s oﬃcially the
start of the 2013
gaming calendar.
Even before I got to mark ten days on
my pin-up calendar of Alyx ‘Miss Jan-
uary’ Vance, there’s news that blows
away the cobwebs of 2012. As it’s exam
time, I’m gonna be light on your mind
and not hide any secret messages in
the article this time (No, really. Go
and look back at the old article titles
and ﬁnd where I’ve hidden the Decla-
ration of Independence). So, here’s a
low-down on what you should be pay-
ing attention to – a 2013 menu, if you
will. Some things may have gone oﬀ by
the time they arrive at your table, some
things may have been left out for too
long, making them bland and
rubber y,
whilst other options may have been
burnt beyond recognition, leaving a
horrible taste in your mouth. Bear
in mind, I’m only picking out a few
choice selections here – I can’t men-
tion everything that should be a good
show. Bon appétit.
Project SHIELD
Hot oﬀ the press, is news of Nvidia’s
pet project of 2013 – Project SHIELD
– a handheld console. I can’t fault them
for wanting to try; a games-focussed
hardware giant has a good chance of
stealing some of the love that sits solely
within the bank accounts of Nintendo.
Yet, the images we’ve seen so far, look
like an Alienware-branded console,
which probably doesn’t mean they’re
aiming it at the younger audience. One
problem I can see, is that the older
audience that’ll be prime for play-
ing this, already have a variety
of ways to play games – from
fully-ﬂedged consoles, to smart-
phones. Looking back to the
slow sales of the PS Vita, this
might not be the right choice
for this normally behind-the-
scenes company, but time
will tell. As will sales. (As an
aside, I hope this thing has
amazing ventilation – I
don’t like the idea of
holding a radiator.)
Paired with SHIELD
is GRID – a graphics
cloud. It’s powerful
on paper, and people
are touting it as a great
way to compete with desktop comput-
ers, with the ability to stream gameplay
to handheld devices. Does anyone else
remember what happened to OnLive,
or is it just me?
Watch Dogs
First seen at E3 2012, Watch Dogs is
an open-world game, set in a world
slightly more technologically depend-
ent than ours. Gameplay revolves
around hacking and gadgets, but it still
keeps true to the current style of open-
world games, incorporating third-per-
son shooter elements, along with the
stealth and parkour aspects of the As-
sassin’s Creed series. I personally think
the game will be quite a hit, probably
with a large viral marketing or tech-
based advertising scheme. It currently
looks as serious a game as GTA4 (ig-
noring anything that involved Roman
and his love of big American tee-tees),
but with any luck, there will be the
opportunity to add some Saint’s Row
madness (maybe not going as far as
Whored mode, but still).
Wasteland 2
My ﬁrst foray into the world of Kick-
starter – Wasteland 2. There’s a bit of
a history here -–Wasteland 2 is the se-
quel (well, duh-doi) to Wasteland, the
grand-father of all post-apocalyptic
role-playing games, such as the Fallout
franchise. The development team is
made up of inXile Entertainment and
Obsidian Entertainment, groups cre-
ated after the dissolution of the origi-
nal Fallout development teams, and
who are also responsible for the age-
less Neverwinter Nights 2 and Fallout:
New Vegas. Obsidian Entertainment
is practically Black Isle Studios 2.0 –
Black Isle Studios was responsible for
Fallout 2. Considering their creden-
tials, and the progress we’ve already
seen, Wasteland 2 should be great – a
harkening back to the olden days of
the role-playing genre. Except
with better graphics. And
probably more bugs.
Pokémon X & Y
You can tell what social circles you’re
in by the number of Facebook posts
mentioning the reveal of Pokémon X &
Y on your feed. Everyone’s so excited,
it’s as if they’ve seen an Oasis vending
machine in the middle of the desert,
despite the latest Pokémon games
coming out less than three months
ago. I watched the CES reveal and to
be honest, these editions do look good.
The 3DS and its offspring seem ideal
for the first handheld 3d Pokémon
foray and to be fair, there’s a predicted
worldwide release (in other words, we
all get the game at the same time) for
October this year, so there’s plenty of
time to fill up that Pokédex with *flips
pages* the 649 current Pokémon. I feel
old.
Star Wars 1313
I loved Star Wars Bounty Hunter. That
feeling of being the bad-ass Jango Fett,
and ﬂying throughout the galaxy to
capture your unwitting targets was
great. Star Wars 1313 is a re-
turn to bounty-hunting
bad-assery, now set dur-
ing the rise of the Galactic
Empire. You’re going to be
hunting your prey on
Level 1313 of Cor-
uscant, so be
prepared

ControverZ
It’s not exactly a secret that I’m a fan
of zombie games. From fully-ﬂedged
team-based games such as Left 4 Dead,
to mods such as No More Room in Hell
and DayZ. If you’ve been around this
genre before, you’ll notice that it nearly
always takes place in the ruins of cities
and towns. It makes sense, to be honest
– it allows for a more varied playground
of zombie-killing madness. DayZ took
advantage of a massive piece of coun-
tryside, and made it lonely and brutal.
And best-selling. Well, it’s free, so it’d
be best-selling if you could actually sell
it. Another group ﬁnally noticed this
chasm in the market, and promised us
The War Z. The one thing that smelled
ﬁshy to the oﬃce, was that it quickly
popped up on our radar, months after
DayZ started building momentum, and
less than a year later, The War Z was up
on Steam. And now we know how.
Despiteeveryonepayingfullpriceand
the developers stating wonderful facts
about the game, the whole thing was in
an alpha-stage (to put it nicely). In other
words, The War Z team lied to get more
sales. Steam pulled the software from
their store and allowed refunds (a rare
occurrence within the Steam oﬃces).
Labelling itself “The World’s First
Survival MMO Zombie Game” The
War Z gives (well, gave) gamers a mul-
ti-environment open-world zombie
slaughter-fest. Now, lots of games will
fall under the wheels of the gaming
train each year. (A new year, and I’m al-
ready creating horrible analogies). Un-
favourable reviews, broken gameplay,
bad advertising – all routes to the bar-
gain bin. None are as heinous, however,
as bad PR. Upon the murmurings of
dissension within the community, the
developers replied with ‘If you don’t like
the game, it’s not our fault. If you fol-
lowed the the game’s description, word-
for-word, then you took us too literally.
‘ (not their exact words, but you’ve got
the jist).
Needless to say, unhappy customers
ensued and the aggressive stance of the
developers did nothing to help. Pro-tip:
don’trushyourgame,justsoyoucanget
it out ﬁrst, and don’t tell your customers
to go frack themselves when they point
out your mistakes.
Ifyou’veahankeringforanopenworld
zombieorgy,eithergiftthegametoyour
housemates for April’s Fools, or wait for
the DayZ standalone to power through
to victory triumphant. Hopefully.
I was hoping that they’d be able to
recover, at least, but they’ve dug them-
selves into even deeper holes now. Bans
based on your k:d ratio, the inability to
play the game for four hours after you
die (unless you pay, of course) and a
class-action lawsuit will probably ﬁnish
the game oﬀ.
