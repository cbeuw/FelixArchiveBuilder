Union to hold referendum on NUS
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Personally, I have a great deal of re-
spect for Liam Burns. I should im-
agine he has an incredibly diﬃcult
job attempting to mire the two ends
of the tertiary education system:
Higher Education (Universities) and
Further Education (more vocational
courses). The two systems – in my
opinion -have very diﬀerent needs
and objectives. And so how can one
body, the NUS, ever hope to proper-
ly represent everyone? Well, I don’t
think it can.
At a recent NUS Conference the
phrase “Well, there’s the Russell
Group, and then there’s the rest of
us…” left the mouth of the NUS’s Di-
rector of Policy, Jim Dickinson. As
much as I found Jim a great speaker,
this sentence, for me, perfectly ex-
plains why I don’t think Imperial is
a suitable member of the NUS. NUS
policy is written to appease the ma-
jority membership of Further Edu-
cation institutions that make up the
NUS governance structure; little
reﬂects the needs and wants of the
‘top end’ of the Higher Education
market – the G5 and Russell Group
Universities. If we had been aﬃliated
to NUS, I would have felt insulted
listening to Jim disregarding the
Russell group from his conference
speech.
Historically, our relationship with
NUS has always been fraught – be
it arguments over aﬃliation fees
to stances on conscription during
WWII. I didn’t help the situation by
telling someone from Bristol whilst
at the conference that “NUS doesn’t
really like us” (or words to that ef-
fect…) only to be overheard by Liam
and be told “Oh, you must be from
Imperial!” We agreed that the issue
was more mutual than a one-sided
dislike.

Union President 2012-13
The debate, however, of whether we
should be in the NUS has not been
given to the student body for nearly
ﬁve years. Very few of the students
who voted to leave the NUS back in
2008 are around now – we are a new
cohort who should be able to make
that decision for ourselves. I very
strongly believe that we should re-
main out of the NUS – its ‘beneﬁts’
are far outweighed by its costs and
associated policy stances.
My arguments are for another Felix
article, however – at this point in
time, I invite anyone interested in
organising a ‘vote yes’ and a ‘vote no’
campaign to come forward and get
involved in the discussion.
A referendum will – if all goes to plan
– be held during sabbatical elections.
As in elections, all full members of
the Union are eligible to vote.
NUS: A pottered history
Imperial College Union will hold an
NUS referendum during this year’s
sabbatical elections, which will take
place from 8-15 March 2013.
The referendum will be to decide
whether or not we re aﬃliate with the
NUS (National Union of Students).

OUT
(History compiled by Paul Beaumont)
An investigation was launched after a
staﬀ member thought a kestral may have
been either shot (yes, shot, as in by a gun)
or had died after colliding with Sherﬁeld.
After the investigation, it turned out
that nobody had been doing some hunt-
ing of kestrals on campus, and that the
bird was actually a Woodcock that was
attacked by another bird, possibly a Per-
egrine Falcon.
A post mortem by a College vet also,
unsurprisingly, found no evidence that
someone had “popped a cap in the
Woodcock’s ass, yo”

Imperial hires first ever Provost
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Professor James Stirling CBE FRS has
been named the ﬁrst Provost of Impe-
rial College London.
He will be in charge of all academic
matters, and so will be in charge of both
education and research. He will report
to the President and Rector, who will, in
future, be more front facing in the UK
and overseas. The position of Provost
comes from a separation of the Rector’s
former position.
Professor Stirling, 59, is currently the
Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philos-
ophy and Head of the Department of
Physics at the University of Cambridge.
He is a theoretical particle physicist.
Professor Stirling will take up his role at
Imperial by August 2013. His appoint-
ment follows an international search to
ﬁnd the ﬁrst Provost.
Professor Stirling has worked in the
UK and overseas. He became a full Pro-
fessor at the very young age of 39. He
founded the particle physics institute
at Durham University, where he also
served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Re-
search. He is a Fellow of the Royal So-
ciety, having been elected in 1999, and
has chaired many UK Research Council
scientiﬁc committees.
Professor Stirling said that he has
“admired Imperial from afar for many
years”
. He continued: “To me that
means excellence in scholarship – both
teaching and research – and excellence
in innovation and taking our knowl-
edge outwards to address big societal
challenges.” He also said: “I am im-
pressed that Imperial has a very clear
view on what it needs to do to grow
its academic mission and maintain
this excellence, and I believe Imperial
has everything that it takes to provide
a great experience for its students,
a wonderfully strong aﬃnity for its
alumni and supporters, and a brilliant
environment for its staﬀ to teach, dis-
cover and innovate”
Announcing the appointment, Keith
O’Nions, President & Rector, looked
forward to welcoming a man with an
“outsanding scientiﬁc mind as well as a
track record of leadership in universi-
ties”
.
