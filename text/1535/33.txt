FRIDAY 11 JANUARY
The Hangman review of 2012
T
his year will probably be
most remembered for a few
things: fat men dancing ir-
ritatingly, and then other
people copying it even
more irritatingly. The year that Prince
Harry’s bumhole was paraded around
as though he were a drunk fresher on
the way home from TigerTiger. The
year that Princess Catherine the ﬁrst
of Middletonian was photographed
naked on holiday with His William-
ness-thank-fuck-he’s-not-Charles
Prince “Wills” of Windsor. This prox-
imity to him in an undressed state
(allegedly) caused a Royal BabyTM
to
be announced. This was just after the
Levesen enquiry produced a roughly
2000 page report that nobody read
about how people who take pictures
up women’s skirts are slightly dickish,
amongst other things that are less tit-
tilating. One person who read this (the
count is now up to a grand total of two
– one being Levesen himself) was Da-
vid Cameron. If you don’t know who
he is then please avert your eyes, as
you probably don’t want to ﬁnd out.
Sure you want to proceed? Fine. He’s
a sort of robot made from pastys that
are taxed at 3000% who was created for
the sole aim of hiring men who may or
may not call policemen plebs but deﬁ-
nitely rides a bike like he’s from a BBC
show about 1920s Cambridgeshire.
Back on to David Cameron: he’s the
Prime Minister. That means his job
is to be posh, or something. He read
the report, which basically apparently
said something about having a watch-
dog for the press. This is what every-
one can only presume was said in it,
because obviously no journalists have
had the time or will to read the report:
they either a.) skim read for ﬁve pages,
got bored, and skipped to the conclu-
sions and watched a video of Leveson
saying what he thought if they work
for the Guardian or b.) control found
“sex” and “drugs” – try it for yourself
– in the hope of ﬁnding out that some-
one from TOWIE sniﬀed cocaine
from Prince Harry’s bumhole if you
work for the Daily Mail. None of them
did by the way. His Prime Ministerist
David Cambot said: “NAH, fuck that,
let’s just basically have it like it is now
and go back to not watching Steve
Coogan talk about paparrazi and OH
MY GOD THERE’S A ROYAL BABY
ON THE WAY! FUCK YEAH! WILL
IT BE TWINS?”
Anyway, other signiﬁcant happen-
ings were that everyone suddenly
heard about a guy named Kony that
people started caring about for a bit
then forgot who he was and no longer
really care about. It seems Kony is tak-
ing lessons from Assad on how to be
an arse and noone care.
There was also big news for Brit-
ain. The Olympics turned out to not
be shit, which everyone thought
they would be. There was a massive
Opening Ceremony telling the story
of Britain until it was stopped to let
Lord Coe talk about how great eve-
rything is, and the man with the least
charisma in the world, Jacque Rogge,
win a bet he made with a mate about
how dull he could make his speech. At
one point the Queen jumped out of a
plane and was then forced to watch an
hour or so of athletes walking around
dressed up like ﬂight attendants or, in
Britain’s case, a teenager from 1993
going on a night out in his best pair
of trackies. There was also a slightly
crapper Closing Ceremony, which
resembled the entertainment at But-
lins. Although Butlins would never let
George Michael perform a high en-
ergy version of “Freedom” followed by
his new song that nobody reading this
can remember. The Closing Ceremo-
ny’s shittiness can be summed up by
the fact that the even got downgraded
in the “what Royal is forced to watch
this” league.
It’s safe to say that it wasn’t a good
year for Jimmys. First it turned out that
a man who acted like a creepy, sinister
old man actually was a creepy, sinister
old man. ‘Sir’ (obvious reasons for the
inverted commas) Jimmy Savile was
such an unpalatable character that
if he were an ingredient even every
contestant on Masterchef combined
couldn’t ﬁnd a way to work him into
an okay dish. Then Jimmy Carr turned
out to be avoiding tax like it was the
plague. Although, when juxtaposed
with Savile like that, his scandal was
deﬁnitely not that bad by comparison.
Of course George Osbourne, who, if
you don’t know what he is, is a sort
of pug nosed man with a debilitating
condition causing him to permanently
be pulling a cum face, was “shocked”
to hear this as his job doesn’t involve
money and taxing people at all.
Oh, and the Queen has been on the
throne for ages. To celebrate this, a
load of boats went paddling about in
the Thames, with the Queen and oth-
ers forced to stand and wave for so
long that technically it could be clas-
siﬁed as torture (USA will have taken
note no doubt and start making pris-
oners do this too).
Boris Johnson, who’s a ﬂoppy haired
children’s cartoon that occasionally
plays the London Mayor on TV saw
a surge in popularity as he bumbled
about, got stuck on a wire (sadly no-
one had any eggs handy to throw), and
generally worked the PR machine in
his bid to be crowned King.
2012 was the year that Obama got
re-elected as it became increasingly
diﬃcult to defend voting for Mitt
Romney solely based on the fact that
his hair is nice and he looks a bit like
an actor who might play the President
in a disaster ﬁlm. Fun fact: this isn’t
the ﬁrst time he’s run for President.
He never got this far before though,
as clearly seen when his inexperience
showed through as he forgot to stop
saying dickish things and calling near-
ly half of the population free loaders.
Last year will also be remembered
for the year that you could be knighted
for being really good at riding a bicy-
cle. “But it’s about the hard work and
dedication and training and not tak-
ing performance enhancing drugs and
being inspirational and a good role
model”. True. Good point. But still,
dedication to riding a bike. Fast. Yes.
But still riding a bike. A feat that many
children are dedicated to for a while.
Where the fuck are their honours?
Corruption.
Timeline of the year
Kony, as you prob-
ably didn’t recog-
nise him.
The Queen on her
row boat.
Quote from Jimmy Carr’s neighbour,
Sarah Spence. Look out for the in-
credible parting thought: “There was
a group of about 10 or 15 builders at
the school and when they heard that
Jimmy Carr lived in the area they kept
an eye out for him.
“Although he’s away on
tour a lot he values the
time he has at home and
was obviously getting
a bit annoyed being
reminded of his tax
affairs every time
he walked out of
his front door.
“Still, that will
teach him to pay his
taxes in future.”
A still from a new film
about a man who has
a tragic illness where
he has to dance like
a twat all the time or
he will have no money
to eat.
Pornographic
cartoon showing
Lisa Simpson giv-
ing head.
That white beret
may make him
easier to spot.
Royal Baby Mamma.
We all know you Goog-
led those pictures.
I believe around
his neck is what
you call “bling”.
Leveson and his
report. Nice blue.
Second place is
good too bro.
