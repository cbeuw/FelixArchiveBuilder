FRIDAY 11 JANUARY

Not a debateable outcome
or the ﬁrst time in living
memory, Imperial College
has been represented at the
annual World Universities
Debating Championships.
This year’s WUDC competition was
hosted by the Berlin Debating Union
in Technische Universität Berlin from
the December 27th until the January
4th.
By the conclusion of the competi-
tion, Ed Middleton, an Imperial 5th
year medic, was placed as the 84th
highest ranked speaker in the world.
The whole Imperial team, virgins of
the WUDC, ranked highly in the top
20% of the 400 competing teams.
Imperial’s judges were also person-
ally chosen by the event’s organisers to
judge the highest quality debates at the
competition.
Each competing team, made up of
two people, takes part in a gruelling
nine individual rounds of diﬀerent de-
bates over a ﬁve day period. Each de-
bate is against a room of teams made
up of the best student debaters in the
world. The event is the largest debat-
ing tournament in the world, with
over 1000 speakers, judges and organ-
isers in attendance.
The Berlin competition was eventu-
ally won by a team from Monash Uni-
versity (Australia); a university that
has now won the WUDC three times
in a row.
The Imperial team and judges were
selected in internal trials within the
College, which were adjudicated by
external judges. The victorious team
was chosen to compete and two run-
ners up representing Imperial as judg-
es.
For next year’s competition in Chen-
nai (India) the Debating Society will
again hold open trials for anyone to
compete for an opportunity to rep-
resent Imperial and they say they are
encourage new people to “have a go”
at debating.
Debating Society President, James
Clough, who along with Ed Middleton
made up the other half of the Imperial
team at the WUDC, had never debat-
ed before he came to university.
“We are looking forward to new
people competing in debating for a
chance to represent Imperial in next
year’s WUDC competition and at
other competitions closer to home,”
he said.
“I think I can safely say that all of us
had an excellent week in Berlin and are
already looking forward to next year”
There was also of course a social ele-
ment to the event, with a lot of what
Niall Jeffrey gets arguing with everyone in sight at the World
Universities Debating Championships
has been described as international
“networking”. The competition, last-
ing from December until January, gave
all present the chance to celebrate the
New Year in the manner expected of
1000 university students.
