Rory Fenton
Religion for Atheists
n atheist church”
I repeated the sen-
tence a few times to
myself while making
my way along Isling-
ton’s St Paul’s road on Sunday morn-
ing. St Paul’s famous road to Da-
mascus led him to found Christian
communities but this St Paul’s road
was taking me to a whole new con-
cept of human community: an atheist
church. As in, a church for atheists.
Could this work? Did it even make any
sense? I wasn’t sure. But I was keen to
ﬁnd out.
I was on my way to the ﬁrst ever
meeting of The Sunday Assembly, the
brainchild of comedians Sanderson
Jones and Pippa Evans. Formed under
the motto of “live better, help often,
wonder more”, the monthly meetings
aim, in the words of Jones, to give
London atheists “all the things that
are good about bringing a community
together and make us better people,
just without God being involved”. The
group have no problem with borrow-
ing directly from religion, the services
themselves are held in an old, decon-
secrated church.
But Sanderson and Pippa aren’t the
ﬁrst people to have this idea, although
they seem to be the ﬁrst to put it into
practice in London. The thought of
creating a religion-like community of
atheists, agnostics, humanists etc. has
been a hot topic of discussion since
Alain de Button published his book
Religion for Atheists almost exactly a
year ago. De Button argued that rath-
er than shun everything with a “reli-
gion” label, non-believers should look
at where religion did get it right, in-
cluding in building community, pro-
viding perspective, realising our hu-
man ﬂaws and giving us a focus for art
and architecture. It is the ﬁrst of these,
building community, that the Sunday
Assembly chieﬂy targets.
The idea is pretty controversial with
many atheists. Some can’t see there
being anything worth learning from
religion. After all, if it’s based on a
false premise, how could a religion get
anything right? And doesn’t the idea
of an atheist church open up the non-
religious to the age-old accusation of
“you’re really just another type of reli-
gion”? I decided to withhold my judg-
ment and see for myself what this type
of atheist community would look like.
So up St Paul’s Road I went…
The building itself was indeed a
stereotypical Church of England
stone house of worship, now used as
a Steiner school. Having grown up
Catholic I’m pretty used to church
A
Rory Fenton shares him impressions from the first meeting of The
Sunday Assembly, London’s new ‘atheist church’
buildings but many atheists, espe-
cially those from religious but non-
Christian backgrounds, may ﬁnd this
oﬀ-putting. But I quickly stopped
thinking about that, because the big
news of this Sunday Assembly be-
came immediately clear as I walked in
– the idea is incredibly popular. With
ﬁve minutes to go before show time,
the place was completely packed with
about 200 people. I was just about able
to grab a child’s stool at the back (as in
a stool meant for children, I wouldn’t
steal from a child; not unless they had
it coming) and a minute later heard
half panicked, half jubilant commands
to open up the choir balcony to ac-
commodate even more people. By the
time the meeting started, there were
still a good 30 people either sat on the
ﬂoor or standing at the sides.
So it seemed I wasn’t the only one
curious to see this idea in action. The
service itself lasted just over an hour
and was, again, very much inﬂuenced
by Christian services. It had much of
the format of an evangelical service
with sermons sandwiched between
hymns. Yep – sermons and hymns.
So what is an atheist sermon? Well it’s
very funny, or at least these ones were.
Since the Sunday Assembly’s founders
are comedians, their sermons felt very
much like a stand-up gig. The event is
compered by the messianic-ly bearded
Sanderson Jones who introduced the
whole idea behind the project and was
generally very funny. There was also a
guest speaker, this week’s being chil-
dren’s author Andy Stanton. I can’t say
I got too much from Andy’s speech.
There was a general atmosphere in
the church of the organisers being
very keen not to seem “preachy” but
what that meant with Andy was that
instead of giving his words of wisdom
on “beginnings”, supposedly reﬂecting
on how he became an author, he just
made a lot of self-deprecating jokes
interspersed with pauses that felt a
bit too long to be intentional. That
said, the idea of an atheist (or perhaps
more precisely a humanist) ‘sermon’
is far from a crazy one. Humanists
admire great scientists, philosophers
and poets and a sermon based around
their works and a secular theme like
‘wonder’ or ‘relationships’ is perfectly
reasonable, in the understanding that
these are just words of advice intend-
ed to provoke personal reﬂection.
Pippa’s stand-up style talk about not
sweating the little stuﬀ was a nice ex-
ample of this. So atheist sermons get
a thumbs up.
And an atheist hymn? This Sun-
day’s hymns were ‘Don’t Look Back in
Anger’ and ‘Build Me Up Buttercup’.
They even had a live band and lyrics
on a projector screen. Hey, I’m cool
with this too. As a Catholic I played
in a church group and quite miss this.
Songs are always full of messages
about life, why not enjoy them togeth-
er? Convincing a room of Londoners
who don’t know each other to sing to-
gether is a whole other story. I don’t
reckon anymore than 20% of us had
the gall to join in, but maybe that’ll
improve with time. I like this idea –
atheist hymns also get a thumbs up.
And then came the prayer stuﬀ. OK
not actual prayers, since no deity was
invoked, but some very prayery stuﬀ.
A ‘moment of silent reﬂection’ was en-
couraged which made me, and I imag-
ine others, feel pretty uncomfortable.
Not so much because I didn’t like the
reﬂection thing, mind. When my fam-
ily prays before meals I don’t join in
but I do try to remind myself that I’m
pretty lucky to have food and should
be glad of this fact, even if I’ve no god
to thank. So I do see how atheists can
use moments of quiet reﬂection in
their lives. But to see this form a part
of the atheist church service made me
pretty uncomfortable, quite probably
because it just felt so religious. Per-
haps I should just get over this, but
the Sunday Assembly need to remem-
ber that many attendees may have had
uncomfortable religious experience
in the past, making organized silence
challenging.
But the silent reﬂection was a little
more prayery than mere silence. Be-
ing January, the service’s theme was
around beginning new things and
resolutions. In our silence, we were
encouraged to think about something
we want to change in our lives and
how great that would feel to achieve.
We were told that scientists have
shown that just by saying something
out loud, our brains will believe it is
true. Now I am all for encouraging
“
It had much
of the format
of an evan-
gelical service
with sermons
sandwiched
between
hymns. Yep –
sermons and
hymns.
“ The Sunday Assembly focuses
on building community in the
same way that religions do,
but without including God
