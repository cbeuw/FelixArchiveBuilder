Satire
The Gospel according to St. Felicitus
1"Many men did lie and the papers
did write much bullshit for there
was an election in the land"
A n d it came to pass in the land of
Brit'ain in the year of one thousand
nine hundred and seventy nine that
there was chaos in the land. Many
men did lie and the papers did write
much bullshit for there w a s a
election in the land.
A n d from the turmoil, there rose
victorious a woman by the name of
Margar'et who fought with the
blessed Saachi's and she went to
live in the palace of ten D o w ' n i n g
Street. A n d , lo, there was a little bit
of joy-making and Margar'et did
turn to face the Sun and sayeth unto
them: 'Thank thee, Larry Lamb and
have thee a Knighthood and thank
thee Rupert Murdoch and have thee
the rest of the press.'
A n d all was wonderful. But there
was a voice crying in the wilderness
saving Took upon the land and thou
will see a multitude with no work'.
A n d this was Foot, the prophet of
doom.
Many did believe the words of the
false prophets and the people sayeth
unto the government through the
great M O R I that sixty percent liked
not their policies. A n d another
election approacheth and yea did
the people of Brixton and Toxteth
rise up in revolt.
2"King Galti'eri arose from the
south to do battle loith Margaret."
Immediately from the Seas of
the South came a great cry for help
and, lo, King Galti'eri from the land
of the Argentine walked upon the
shores of the FalkTands. A n d the
sheep and both the inhabitants were
very upset.
Margar'et d i d look upon the
FalkTands and she did blow her top
and sayeth unto her advisers 'This
is all thine fault. Get thee away
C a r r i n g t o n , Knott a n d P y m . '
A n d she did goeth on 'We will send
a force of ships to smite the
Argentine'.
A n d Parliam'ent did reply ' O h
absolutely, O h divine leader, whose
handbag w e are not fit to look
upon.'
A n d the great fleet did sail for
forty days and forty nights. But the
general knew no law for he sent
forth his finest boat, the General
Belgrano. A n d the divine Margar'et
did look upon this boat, saying
Yonder boat may not enter the holy
Zone of Exclusion for if it does it will
feel my wrath'. A n d the Belgrano
did not enter the Zone of Exclusion
but she sank it anyway.
It came to pass that Margar'et did
beat the sh*t out of the Argentines
and there was much rejoicing and
all the people did celebrate the great
victory. But Tarn Dalyel rebuked
Margar'et saying unto her 'thou
hast cheated.'
A n d the scribes of The Mail and
the Express did say 'Maggie, thou
art Wonderful' and the people did
agree.
4" A great photo-opportunity"
Now, the barbarians of the
IR'A who kneweth no law and
no honour did tryeth to blow up the
divine Margar'et and lo, they did
make a cock-up for Margar'et
surviveth and there was a great
'photo-opportunity'.
And the Cabin'et was like a house
divided for Hesel'tine, lord of the
jungle, did fight with Britt'an the
master of the trades over the great
St. Feliticus started life as a Tabloidian
Monk and is perhaps best known for his
visions. He frequently claimed to have
seen such marvels as flying pigs and
translucent pink elephants, especially
after long days spent saving souls at local
Inns.
He was also the author of the first
Tabloidian Bible: a fascinating text,
unique for its original interpretation of
many of the Biblical Stories especially the
highly imaginative accounts of what
Adam and Eve did when God wasn't
looking.
This article was originally written by
the Saint for the 'Medieval Mail'.
3"And the Star of David Owen
arose in the West"
Now, there arose in the west
the shining star of David O w e n .
A n d the star did lead the three wise
persons of the S D P to seek out the
tribe of the Li'berals and they did
make alliance with gifts of gold,
commoncense and claret.
But still it came to pass that
Margar'et did win the next election.
And the prophets of doom did say
unto their leader Foot, 'Get thee
lost' and he was banished to the
land of the Backbenches.
There arose a new prophet of
doom, Kinnock, a bag of wind from
the land of the Dragon and he
saveth many things and lo, the
people paid him no heed.
A n d there were rumblings from
the Land of the Pits and Scargill,
Lord of the Pits, did stand up and
rebuke Margar'et saying 'Thou
destroyeth the jobs of the men of the
pits.'
But Margar'et did turn to Scargill
and sayeth 'Piss thee off, for my
disciple Mac'Gregor and the loyal
hosts of the boys in blue will smite
thee for thou art the enemy within'
and yea, battle commenced.
For a year did the tribe of the pits
fight the boys in blue until at last the
men of the pits did cry, 'Alright, you
win' and returneth to work. A n d lo,
there was wailing and gnashing of
teeth and the miners were indeed
sequestrated.
flying machines of WestTand. A n d
Hestl'tine did leaketh unto the
Lord's of Fleet Street that the
Americans did covet WestTand and
this w a s n o t right. F o r the
Europ'eans did also covet WestTand
and, behold, they were our partners
in the Community of Europe.
A n d Britt'an also leaketh and the
Island was awash with leaks. A n d
Bernard Ingham who was known as
' s o u r c e s - c l o s e - t o - t h e - P r i m e -
Minister' did let the World know
that this was not the fault of the
divine Margar'et. A n d time d i d
pass and Hestl'tine did resign and
Britt'an was banished to the darkest
depths of Bruss'els.
5"The people of the centre did fight
one another on the field of the
Guardian letters page"
Across the sea from Brit'ain was the
old king Rea'gan who sayeth unto
his people 'Okey-Dokey, we must
- er - smite the M a d Dog Quaddafi
of Lyb'ia for - er - he is a man
without honour who knoweth no
law'. A n d all save Margar'et did say
unto him 'Well, we will help thee
not' i
But Margar'et, who knoweth all
under heaven, did help Rea'gan for
she gave h i m her country for his
machines of war. A n d the machines
of Rea'gan did fly out across the
world and did bomb babies and BBC
Reporters. But they did miss the one
known as the Mad Dog and Rea'gan
sayeth unto the World 'Thou ain't
seen nothing yet'.
A n d , yea, it was again time for
another election and the followers
of Margar'et did fight the prophets
of doom, who were now called as
the followers of the rose, and did
fight the many headed people of the
centre. A n d O w e n , the prophet of
the centre, did say unto the people
'Vote for me for I have no policies'.
A n d Margar'et d i d smite the
followers of the rose and the people
of the centre and did again ascend
the throne of Dow'ning Street. A n d ,
lo, the people of the centre did right
one another on the fields of the
Guardian Letters Page and, yea,
thev were stricken never to rise
again.

' 'Let there be privatisation of gas,
water and electricity"
O n the other side of the Earth,
a man by the name of Wright did go
out among the people and did say
unto them 'the lord's of intelligence
in Brit'ain have been very naughty'.
A n d Margar'et did say unto the
Judges 'He cannot say that'. A n d
the Judges of Brit'ain did agree. But,
lo, on the other side of the earth the
Judges did say 'thou art wrong'.
A n d Margar'et sent forth Lord
Arm'strong k n o w n as he who is
economical with the truth to argue
with the Judges but to no avail. A n d
it came to pass that all the peoples
of the World, save those of Brit'ain,
did read the book of Wright and
they found it to be of no worth.
A n d on a Rock in the Sea in the
Middle of the Earth the barbarians
of the I R ' A did again plan a deed
most foul. Yet they had no bomb.
But this worried Margar'et not and
the barbarians were slain by the
divine warriors of the S A ' S . A n d
the warriors did say unto the people
'We cannot tell thou what happened
for it is an Official Secret'.
Lo, Margar'et c o n t i n u e d i n
power. A n d she did say let there be
privatisation of gas and water and
electr'icity, a n d lo, there w a s
privatisation of gas water and the
electri'city and there were many
who made a killing o n the stock
market. A n d on the second day she
did introduce loans for the poor and
for the stud'ents. A n d the widow
had to give up her mite to the poll-
tax. A n d Margar'et went on and on
and on, but on the seventh day she
irested.
