Koko
Author of more than a dozen horror
stories, including Ghost Story and
The Talisman (co-written w i t h
Stephen King), this marks Peter
Straub's first venture into pure
thriller territory.
A group of Vietnam vets, casually
fronted bv Michael Poole, reunite
with a new mission objective. In
South East Asia a string of murders
has come to light, each victim
mutilated and with a playing card
stuffed in his mouth. The cards all
have the word Koko scrawled on
them.
Other than the four platoon
members i n N e w York there are
only a couple of likely perpetrators,
an author Tim Underbill thought to
be in Singapore and Victor Spitalny,
missing since during the war.
The murders duplicate incidents
in a small Vietnam village, la Thuc,
twenty years ago, and it appears
that Underhill must be to blame. So
three of the comrades fly off, hoping
to catch the recluse writer, gain the
syndicated mini-series rights a n d
earn a packet, and the other stays
in N e w York to get rid of his
cockroaches, his restaurant open,
and eventually killed.
In telling this tale, potentially a
wild and racey chase across the
world, the author has relied on
changing location and dropping in
a new clue now and then to provide
the pace. This would be quite
effective if only the need to supply
c o m p r e h e n s i v e detail h a d n ' t
padded out the events so much.
The past is recalled here and there
a piece at a time, but the intricate
narrative again clouds the salient
incidents, and having failed to put
the clues together I needed it
spelling out in the end.
The culmination of the search is
fairly exciting, well written and
cleverly constructed, but it takes a
little long getting there. Straub
certainly has a feel for his subject
matter, and provides a convincing
account of his locations, especially
the brothels and bars of Bangkok.
You may be surprised what can be
done with a cigarette or a couple of
ping-pong balls.
Koko is well written, at times
stylish, and although its length
makes it drag occasionally, it also
makes for a thick, chunky book
that's good to get your hands
around. It will be out in paperback
soon.

Mississippi
Burning
The last of the great Oscar nominees
is here. Alan Parker, director of
Angel Heart and Midnight Express
presents us with a movie revolving
around the suppressive bigotry of
1964 America.
Mississippi has a cancer, the
danger of racial integration.
Salvation for the rednecks comes in
the form of the White Knights of the
K u Klux Klan, determined oppose
the infiltration of equality in their
stolid anit-communist Anglo-Saxon
world. Removing the threat involves
removing three young civil rights
workers—two white, one black—in
a brutal murder.
Washington is suspicious of the
Sheriff's 'missing persons' report,
and ] Edgar's finest are dispatched.'
When the Feds come to town a
solution doesn't accompany them,
as tempers fray, tension soars and
the real cancer, equality's
opponents, proves to be malignant.
The turbulance is reflected in the
FBI also, as the uncooperative locals
pressure their sensibilities a n d
compromise their work ethic. Agent
Ward (Willem Dafoe) is a straight,
by-the-book lawman, in charge of
the operation, but not of events.
Agent Anderson (Gene Hackman)
is the natural snoop, digging deep
and keeping wounds open with
provocative, unerring proficiency.
Their tardiness causes Ward to call
in more men, time and again, only
fueling the situation. He only knows
the rules, not the mentality. 'Where
does it come from, all this hatred?'.
But Anderson is a Mississippian
emigre, and he knows the people.
Ultimately it is d o w n to his hard-
nosed attitude and ball-squeezing
tactics to sort the case out.
Mississippi Burning tries very hard
not to be bracketted as a buddy
movie. The abrasive relationship of
the two leads, and their eventual
unity infer the description
throughout though. N o r does the
film tackle it subject matter of racial
hatred and obstinate bigotry with
any real conviction. The events are
used quite well as a backdrop, and
often scrape a raw nerve, but the
corruption and suffering are never
pushed solidly as the pivot of the
film.
There is one resounding victory
for the movie however. The North-
South divide is expressed very well.
The good old boys from Dixie want
to get on with drinking sour mash
and making their own rules. They
do not need the District of Columbia
making decrees absolute, and they
don't need the Hoover-boys.
At the bottom line though, this is
just a cop story, albeit a tense,
atmospheric and poignant example
of the genre. It should be said
though that it deserves its seven
Oscar nominations, but I ' m not
surprised it was beaten to the post
by Rainman and Dangerous Liaisons.

STILL SHOWING
The Tall Guy
Slammed by some, applauded by
others, this directorial debut from
Mel Smith is not the stuff of legend,
but it never pretends to be. It's just
a comedv, and a good one at that.
American actor Jeff Goldblum
suffers on-stage at the hands of
Rowan Atkinson, a n d off-stage
through h i s ' o w n f u m b l i n g
incompetence. But it gets h i m the
girl, Emma Thompson, complete
with nurse's uniform and a good
stock of wisecracks. His disarray
also lands him the lead in the RSC's
musical version of The Elephant
Man.
The script is so strong that when rubbery, and everyone concerned
it flicks effortlessly to solemnity handles R i c h a r d C u r t i s s ' s
you're left embarrased by a stifled (Blackadder, The Young Ones) script
laugh. Atkinson is at his most admirably.
Rain Man
A heart-warming journey across
America with brothers Charlie and
Raymond Babbitt. Tom Cruise is the
younger brother, up to his eyeballs
in shit and in need of a break to save
his sports car business.
He discovers his brother, his ticket
to cash, and ultimately his past.
Hoffman had no competition for his
Oscar and he creates a shuffling
nervous character providing a fixed
point for the movie and benchmark
for Cruise.
Barry Levinson, director of Good
Morning Vietnam makes the film look
good, awash with colour a n d
emotion. Thoroughly deserving of
all its awards. Don't forget the
kleenex.
