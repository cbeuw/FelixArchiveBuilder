Opinion
IC-A Worse Class
By Sydney Harbour-Bridge
I feel compelled to write a second article concerning the academic situation
at IC. Over the past two weeks, following the last article, many people
have spoken to me. With the exception of one person, who said it was
depressing, everyone else liked it. Many have stated they are seriously
considering leaving IC and a number had sent it home to their parents.
Among other comments I was told 'I f**king agree with everything you
wrote' and someone else said 'Why didn't you write it last year, I'd have
left if it wasn't my final year'. The biggest question people have asked
is 'Is it all true?'. The answer is, of course, yes, but I have to admit picking
the two most obvious examples of those friends who entered with me but
did not graduate.
Considering the impact of that
article I feel it important to outline
the fate of the others who did not
graduate. The only people I know,
other than Giles and Caroline, who
did not graduate from that year of
entry in my department, were four
men and one woman. We will call
these people Simon, John, Robert,
Chris and Sarah. Simon finished his
first year with a third and promptly
left to go to Reading, changing his
course from Geology to Geophysics.
When I spoke to Simon two months
ago he informed me that he had
graduated with a 2:1 and, although
he said so himself, was unlucky not
to get a first. He is presently earning
a considerable sum of money with
a geological firm i n Africa. (Less
than five of the original IC set got
jobs in geology on graduation.)
John also got a third and left to go
to Durham, a university he had
qualified for through U C C A but had
rejected i n preference to I C .
Although I hear this by word of
mouth alone, I believe John also
graduated with a 2:1.
Robert failed to complete his first
year due to glandular fever and quit
his resit year in March, becoming an
accountant in the City, a job many
of his fellows took u p after
graduation.
Sarah was resitting her first year
as I entered and she eventually
failed completely at the end of the
year. Depressed and dejected she
returned home to Sweden to restart
her degree there. I have not heard
from Sarah since.
IC really screws you up
I have purposely left Chris until last
as this is a rather different story.
Chris entered the department as an
enthusiastic and socially active
character. H e scored w e l l
throughout the first year, coming
top nearly every week i n one
particular subject, despite being
dissatisfied with the course and the
amount of work. B y half-way
through the year he had given up
all sport, which he was very good,
and, as exams approached, he
became more depressed. He hardly
attended more than an hour of any
of h i s exams a n d continually
suffered from b a d migraine
headaches.
Chris failed his first year exams,
he did not resit or re-enter education
elsewhere. He became a waiter in a
London hotel and, when I last
heard, was a heroin addict and
unemployed.
IC rid Chris of all his faith in the
education system and though many
of his College friends tried to help
him get off drugs he showed
nothing but hostility towards them.
What makes people leave?
Imperial College surveys all of its
stuaents six m o n t h s after
graduation to ascertain their success
in finding a job. Outside of asking
a student who is leaving why he is
doing so, they do not make any
attempt to find out anything about
those who do not graduate. Surely
these people hold the key to how to
improve the standard of education
here.
All of the people who fail at IC
have passed the entry requirements
and hence we can presume have
achieved good enough ' A ' level
grades to enter almost a n y
university in Britain. At the same
time the vast majority of students
entering IC enjoyed their work at
' A ' level a n d have obviously
developed a strong understanding
of the subject. .
The academic staff of IC have
often told me that ' A ' level grades
are not a good indicator of success
at degree level. If this is so, why are
people chosen on the basis of these
grades? If you managed to get good
' A ' level grades and failed your
degree whilst someone with lower
grades passed with flying colours at
another u n i v e r s i t y , there is
obviously something wrong with
the system and not you.
In my mind the problem lie?in the
amount of work that this college
expects of its students. Compare
your situation to that of your friends
at home. Consider what they
thought to be hard work at school
and think about what they are doing
now. In almost all cases you will
find they are doing considerably less
workâ€”staff-student contact hours
and private study.
College ignores the facts
So, is it just the author's opinion
that the amount of lectures and
quantity of material covered at IC is
stifling for an adventurous mind?
Every five years each undergraduate
course is reviewed and 'external
assessors' are invited to comment.
Almost every assessor suggested a
dramatic cut in the lecture and other
contact time. This point is ignored
by the College. T h e College
Undergraduate Studies Committee
and Board of Studies have
recommended a weekly contact time
of twenty hours with a maximum of
25 hours. Nearly every department
breaks this regulation; m y
department does so almost every
week.
So, do we really work too hard?
I believe so, having spoken to
geologists from other universities.
The best example of how hard we
work w a s demonstrated i n a
convention to which IC invites
teachers from schools to convince
them of IC's excellence During a
discussion I was asked if IC was
hard work. I said it was very hard
and that it tended to squash one's
enthusiasm for the subject. I
qualified this by saying that this
prepared students for the outside
world. Immediately three of the four
teachers present said that I should
wait to get into the 'outside world'
and insisted I would find it even
harder work. I retorted saying that
I'd worked i n industry twice for
more than a year and it was easy
and enjoyable compared to life at IC.
They were obviously not convinced
then the fourth teacher spoke up. 'I
was at I C (doing Maths, the course
with the lowest contact hours). 'You
work hard, you work bloody hard,
you worked so hard I left and went
to Southampton where I had a good
time and got a good degree. I
wouldn't recommend one of my
students to come here unless they
. were absolutely brilliant, would
walk through Oxbridge and didn't
want a social life.' She hadn't even
bothered reaching her exam term to
leave IC. To her it just wasn't worth
all that hassle.
All work and no play
I believe that students at IC do want
to work hard, they enjoy doing well
and generally enter College filled
with enthusiasm for their course,
but the workload at IC rids them of
this.
The College will tell you that it is
impossible to cut the size of the
course and contact hours. This is
absolute rubbish. The courses that
have to be approved by external
bodies are described i n o n e
paragraph. The questions set in the
exams rarely cover more than 15%
of the course that is lectured, hence
the same exam a n d course
description could be applied to a
lecture course half as long.
The lecturers of this College do
not understand what they are doing
to the social development of their
students by making them work so
hard. The year before I joined this
college I played bridge every day
and was involved i n national
competitions. I played hockey every
day and badminton once a week. I
still had the time to get four ' A '
levels and gain entry to IC. Within
one term at IC I found I could only
afford to play hockey once a week
and I haven't p i c k e d u p a
badminton racket since.
I was conned when I joined
Imperial College.
