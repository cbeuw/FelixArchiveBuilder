Anger at new building
Academics at Imperial have hit
out against the University Funding
Council's decision to allocate only
Â£3.56m for an extension to the
Chemistry department. They claim
that the extension will not be large
e n o u g h f o r the department's
requirements a n d are concerned
that safety standards will be
compromised because of shortage of
funds.
The building, which is due for
completion by 1993 was given the go
ahead two weeks ago, 20 years after
the initial application to the
Univeristy Grants Committee. A s
part of the deal, the 'volley ball'
block a n d parts of the O l d
C h e m i s t r y b u i l d i n g w i l l be
demolished.
College officials are still
negotiating w i t h the Science
Museum to retain possession of the
lecture theatre block, as n o
provision for replacement theatres
has been made by the U F C .
H e a d of the C h e m i s t r y
Department, Professor Steve Ley
has complained that 'There are no
lecture theatres and it will severely
damage o u r ability to recruit
students.'
He went o n to say that the
building w o u l d not allow the
department r o o m f o r future
expansion and pointed out that the
money allocated by the U F C would
not allow a sufficient number of
fume cupboards to maintain current
safety standards.
The department had originally
applied for a building of 5000 square
meters i n 1965 to rehouse
laboratories a n d lecture theatres
held i n the old chemistry block.
Because the U F C award will only
allow for a building of 2000 square
meters the college will be unable to
replace the labs and lecture theatres
in the old blocks and plans to site
an Interdisciplinary Research Centre
for semi conductors in the new
building have been dropped.
This has angred many academics

delapidated state of the lecture
theatres w i l l discourage t o p
students a n d academics f r o m
applying to Imperial.
'We have lost three senior
professors i n t w o years' said
Professor Ley.
The College has not undertaken
any repair w o r k o n the o l d
C h e m i s t r y b u i l d i n g since the
application for Chemistry II was
made 20 years ago i n the belief that
the older buildings would be
entirely replaced.
The nine storey extension will be
constructed i n t w o stages, with
work on the foundations and an
electrical sub-station due to begin in
April.
Imperial's first application for a
new Chemistry building was turned
down in 1965 after the U G C had re-
adjusted their assessment criteria. A
second application for a smaller
building was turned down in 1972
because the U G C were already fully
committed financially. The College
applied for a building of 4000 square
metres of usable space in 1982
following recommendations by the
Physical Science Sub Committee
who were 'sympathetic with the
conditions in the old buildings.'
This application was postponed
until the College could produce an
appraisal of the amount of free space
available elsewhere in the College
and had determined valid reasons
for these being unsuitable for use by
the department.
The U G C accepted that the
department needed a building with
3000 square metres of floor space but
reduced this figure to 2000 square
metres w h e n they a p p l i e d
assessment criteria more stringently.
Initially the U G C required the old
C h e m i s t r y b u i l d i n g s to be
demolished.
Tt led us to the point where we
couldn't see h o w to r u n the
department with that amount of
space' said a spokesman from the
department.
The U G C relented in April,
allowing the department to retain
the lecture theatre block, subject to
agreement w i t h the Science
Museum who own half of the land
occupied by the building.
The department has tried,
unsuccessfully to obtain extra
funding for the building from
industry.
'Industry is willing to invest i n
research, but not in buildings' said
a spokesman.
Senate
Library
to go
Senate House library may be
forced to throw away thousands of
science textbooks because London
University lacks the money to
redistribute the books to its
constituent Colleges.
The library's 17,000 textbooks
were due to be redistributed to
Imperial, Royal Holloway a n d
Bedford, Kings, Queen Mary, and
University College, but neither the
library nor the colleges are likely to
be able to afford the costs of
recataloging and transporting the
books.
Tt would be easier and cheaper for
the colleges to buy new rather than
to pay for recataloging new stock'
said a spokesman from the Senate
library.
Dr Bernard lamb, a member of the
library's Science Working Party,
told FELIX that many of the books
would have to be 'recycled for waste
p a p e r ' because of the costs
involved.
Senate house library is due to
become an 'arts only' library in 1990
following the recommendations of
the Ryan report o n the library's
future.
A working party is currently
considering the future of the
library's medical collection which is
also d u e to be r e d i s t r i b u t e d
throughout the constituent colleges.
The University of London Union
(ULU) headed a campaign last year
to retain the science and medical
collections of the library and to
prevent the library from becoming
reference only. Although the plans
for a reference only library were
dropped, U L U President, Ruth
Benzimera told FELIX that there was
nothing U L U could do to save the
science and medical collection.
