Feature
Lloyd's List: the new and the old
the central floor are the three
symbols of Lloyd's that have been
moved from the Royal Exchange via
Lime Street to the present site: the
Lutine Bell, the Casualty Book and
the Casualty Board.
The Lutine Bell hangs in the
Underwriting Room and is used
when important announcements are
to be made: one stroke for bad news
and two strokes for good news. The
bell is not rung for every loss at sea:
it was formerly sounded when an
announcement of an overdue vessel
was to be made, but is now sounded
most frequently o n ceremonial
occasions. The bell originally
belonged to a French frigate, the
Lutine, which was captured by the
British in 1793 and used to carry
gold and silver to Hamburg in 1799.
It was wrecked off the Dutch coast
in a violent storm and the claim was
p a i d i n full by the L l o y d ' s
underwriters w h o had insured it.
The bell was raised in 1859 and has
hung i n the Room for ninety years.*
The Casualty Book or Loss Book
contains details of all vessels,
whether insured at Lloyd's or not,
which have become or are likely to
become total losses. The entries are
still made by quill pen and represent
a unique history of nearly three
hundred years of shipping. The
sinking of the Titanic is recorded
with the words:
Tuesday 16th April:
Titanic:
isi British mail Southampton for New
York foundered April 15 about 2.20am
in lat. 41.16 North long. 50.14 West
after collision with ice. Reported by
wireless from Olympic si to the Cape
Race wireless station. Further reports
state that the ioss of life is very great.
The Casualty Board contains the
latest casualty reports in all areas
relating to Lloyd's business. Marine
casualties are printed on yellow
sheets, non-marine on pink and
aviation on blue. News of important
world events is also posted on the
casualty board.
Another source of information is
Lloyd's List. This is a daily paper,
one of the oldest still surviving in
London, which is published by
Lloyd's of London Press. It contains
shipping movements, marine and
aviation casualty reports and details
of fires, strikes and riots. Regular
reports also appear on ship sales,
launchings and charterings. There
are several other publications which
deal in more specialist areas.
Lloyd's Register of Shipping is
not actually produced by Lloyd's,
although its origins go back to
Lloyd's Coffee House and there are
close links between Lloyd's Register
and Lloyd's of London Press. The
Register catalogues characteristics
and construction details of
individual ships to help them in
their insurance activities.
What does Lloyd's insure?
There are four main areas, or
markets, in which Lloyd's insures:
marine, non-marine, aviation and
motor. The marine market covers
everything from oil production
platforms (such as Piper Alpha, see
box) to yachts. The non-marine
market insures against such things
as burglary, earthquake and loss of
profits due to fire. The aviation and
motor markets are offshoots of the
marine market. The aviation market
will cover Concordes to helicopters
and passenger liabilities to com-
munications satellites, while the
motor market covers every aspect of
U K a n d C o m m o n w e a l t h road
transport.
Lloyd's has never been involved
in life assurance; the nature of its
operation makes it unsuitable for
such long term risks and all life
insurance is carried out by private
companies.
Lloyd's is also famous for its
w i l l i n g n e s s to insure almost
anything. Strangely enough, most
of the unusual risks are taken on by
the marine market. Past risks have
included:
• The 'Animal Magic' sea lion,
G e m i n i , for £5,000. She was
brought to Lloyd's and filmed on
the box where her cover was
underwritten. Upset by all the fuss,
she escaped and bit a passer-by.
• Forty members of 'The Whiskers
Club' i n Derbyshire insured their
beards for £20 against loss or theft.
• A grain of rice with a portrait of
the Q u e e n a n d the D u k e of
Edinburgh engraved on it was"
insured at Lloyd's for $20,000.
• A whisky distiller insured his
nose.
• Famous people covered by
Lloyd's insurance include: Betty
Grable's 'million dollar legs',
Christopher Reeve, insured for $20
million during the filming of
'Superman', Bjorn Borg and Pele.
Many English football teams are
insured at Lloyd's under a special
scheme.
• Companies marketing Royal
Wedding souvenirs were insured at
L l o y d ' s against financial loss
resulting from cancellation of the
ceremony.
• Stuntmen are often insured at
Lloyd's and actually represent a
good risk because they take every
possible precaution during stunts.
For the filming of one Cadbury's
Milk Tray advert, champion skier
Jean-Claude Killey had to ski at high
speed d o w n a mountainside,
pursued by a 'controlled' avalanche.
He found himself racing for his life
when the avalanche was detonated
too soon.
Lloyd's is not the only underwriting
market in the world, or even in
London, but it is the oldest and
most remarkable.
How to become a name
Underwriting insurance is obviously
highly profitable, but becoming a
name is not so easy. To become a
member, someone must be re-
commended by two existing Lloyd's
members, undergo strict interviews
by the Council of Lloyd's and prove
that they are worth at least £100,000,
60% of which must be i n liquid
assets such as shares, cash or gold.
The other 40% may consist of
property or land, but not the
candidates home. If things go
wrong, members can lose every-
thing they own, but the rewards for
success are high.
Members are not only at risk from
claims by policy holders. A n
underwriter has recently been
committed for trial on charges of
fraud and mismanagement of
affairs, and, until outlawed quite
recently, it was c o m m o n for
u n d e r w r i t e r s to have s m a l l ,
personal syndicate, called 'The
Baby' for which they would take say
Vi% of a risk they felt was a good
bet.
Lloyd's of London proves that
insurance is a gamble for high
stakes. It is unique i n its history and
the personal touch to business and
moves into its fourth century
stronger than ever.
The 'Piper Alpha' Loss
'Piper Alpha' was owned by four companies: Occidental
Petroleum (36.5%), Texaco (23.5%), International
Thomson (20%) and Union Texas Petroleum (20%).
Estimation of the loss was hindered by each company
having its own share separately insured at different total
valuations. 80% of the loss was insured in London.
Estimated value of loss
(US$ millions)
Physical damage 680
Cost of control 34
Seepage and polution 4
Removal of wreck 85
Redrilling expenses 187
Damage to pipelines 26*
Business interruption 275
TOTAL 1291
The effect of 'Piper Alpha', the largest man-made loss ever
to hit the insurance market, was to force cash flow
problems for the underwriters, 50-100% increase in
premiums and a radical reassessment of the safety of
platforms and operating procedures.
