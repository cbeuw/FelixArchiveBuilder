Lloyd's: the risk business
The name Lloyd's of London is synonymous with the high tech building
in the heart of the City which you either love or loathe. But just what
exactly goes on inside the Richard Rogers contentious creation? Liz Warren
went to find out.
Lloyd's of London is not a company
but a society made u p of
approximately 32,000 members or
names, who undertake to insure
anything from oil tankers to ballet
dancers' toes. The members group
together to form syndicates, of
which there are currently about four
hundred, ranging in size from a few
names to several thousand. Each
syndicate may accept part of a risk.
It will receive that percentage of the
premium a n d have to pay that
percentage of any claims made.
Underwriters and Brokers
Each of the syndicates is re-
presented in the Lloyd's building by
an underwriter (who may have
several assistants). It is the job of the
underwriter to decide on behalf of
the syndicate which risks he will
accept and how much of them he
will take. The name underwriter
comes from the fact that he or she
will write their name under the first
person to accept part of the risk.
This person is called the leader and
ic is the leaders w h o decide on the
size of the premium for the risk.
The risks are presented to the
underwriters by brokers, who act as
middlemen between the clients and
the underwriters, and who receive
a percentage of the premium as
c o m m i s s i o n . They collect the
premiums from the clients to pay
the syndicates and, in the event of
a claim, arrange a settlement and
collect the m o n e y from the
underwriters. There are currently
280 b r o k i n g firms w h o are
authorised to trade with Lloyd's
underwriters.
The Room
All Lloyd's underwriters work i n
one place—The Room. Originally
one room in the Royal Exchange on
Threadneedle Street, the Room now
occupies the ground floor and three
of the galleries in the impressive
glass covered atrium that forms the
centrepiece of the new Lloyd's
building.
The underwriters sit on 'boxes',
a group of desks for each syndicate,
and it is a reflection of the origins
of Lloyd's that the brokers still visit
the underwriters personally to
arrange their business.
When the broker receives the
details of a risk from a client he puts
them on a card, known as a slip, and
visits a n u n d e r w r i t e r w h o
specialises in that risk, for example
oil tankers, whsjm he hopes will
lead the risk. After^questioning and
haggling, a premium will be agreed
and the underwriter takes a line by
writing on the slip the share of the
risk he is prepared to accept for his
syndicate, together with the agreed
p r e m i u m . O n c e a leader is
established, the broker can then
approach other underwriters to take
a share of the risk and write their
names under that of the leader.
The History of Lloyd's
L l o y d ' s is n o w an enormous
institution, and the actual signing of
policies and transferral of money
between brokers and underwriters
is carried out centrally by the
Lloyd's Policy Signing Office. This
is just one of the ways in which the
Corporation of Lloyd's supports and
services its members, others being
the leasing and administration of the
Llovd's building and the collation of
news—both of shipping losses and
important world events.
But where did this efficient and
enormous marketplace emerge
from? The origin of Llovd's was in
Mr Edward Lloyd's Coffee House in
Tower Street in the late seventeenth
centurv. Merchants, shipowners
and captains would gather in the
Coffee House to exchange news,
and Llovd's coffee house gained a
administration of Lloyd's which was
chaired by Sir Henry Fisher, ex-
chairman of Imperial College's
Governing Body. This set up the
Council of Lloyd's which today acts
as both a managing group and a rule
making and self regulatory body.
The Lloyd's Building
Lloyd's has had several homes—Mr
Lloyd's Coffee House; the N e w
Lloyd's Coffee House and the Royal
Exchange, followed by a move to a

reputation for trustworthy shipping
i n f o r m a t i o n — a n d also t h e
recognised place for marine
insurance.
With time, this informal gathering
of L l o y d ' s became more
established—although marine
insurance went along hand in hand
w i t h other less respectable
'insurance'—bets on sick kings
dying within a certain time, for
instance. In 1769, the more
reputable of Lloyd's customers
broke away a n d formed ' N e w
Lloyd's Coffee House' i n nearby
Pope's Head Alley, devoted solely
to marine insurance. In 1774 the
business moved into rooms in the
Royal Exchange on Threadneedle
Street and Cornhill and left its
Coffee House associations behind
forever.
The Society of Lloyd's was given
a formal legal basis by the Lloyd's
Act of 1871 and five subsequent acts
have followed which have met the
changing needs of the society. The
most recent of these was in 1982 and
was the result of an enquiry into the
new building i n Lime Street,
opposite the present site, in 1958.
Each of these moves was the result
of the ever-increasing number of
underwriters as both the number of
syndicates a n d the amount of
business transacted increased.
By the time Lloyd's moved into its
current site, the Richard Rogers
building, in May 1986, the strain on
the Lime Street building was such
that two underwriting rooms were
in use (contrary to the practise of
having all the underwriting in one
room, which was considered to be
Lloyd's strength). The second of
these rooms had formerly been an
underground car park and, as it was
painted yellow, was known by
those who worked i n it as 'The
Yellow Submarine'.
The new building is constructed
around a central atrium with a glass
barrel roof which contains the Room
and all the offices and meeting
rooms. One end is filled with glass
walled escalators that seem to crawl
up and down like caterpillars and on
