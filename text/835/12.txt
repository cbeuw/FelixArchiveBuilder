Ghetto
by Joshua Sobol
Ghetto tells the story of the Jewish
ghetto in the Lithuanian city of Vilna
under Nazi occupation, and of the
desperate struggle for survial of its
inhabitants. Since Jews w h o had
employment survived, one of the
schemes was the formulation of a
threatre troupe, which, incredibly,
p l a y e d to packed houses
t h r o u g h o u t its f e w years of
existence.
The play opens with the discovery
by Kittel, the local SS commandant,
of a Jewish singer i n possession of
some stolen beans. H e insists that
she repay the value of the beans in
performances of which he will be
the judge, since he is an art connois-
seur, and it is true that the real
Kittel patrolled the ghetto with a
machine gun i n o n e hand and a
saxophone i n the other.
Gens, the chief of Jewish police,
and later the leader of the Jewish
c o u n c i l that r u n s the ghetto
supports the formation of the
theatre group, as he does for
anything which can save Jewish
families, despite the idealistic
Z i o n i s t , l i b r a r i a n K u r k w h o
campaigns for ' N o theatre i n a
graveyard!' Gens' stance was that
of a l l the Jewish councils i n
general—they went along with the
wishes of the Germans, although as
Gens demonstrates, their main
point was to save Jewish lives, since
as Gens points out, the Germans kill
more Jews if they resist. H e is even
w i l l i n g to let the despicable
entrepreneur Weiskopf become a
millionaire on the backs of others,
by repairing G e r m a n uniforms
because it gives employment.
The play is full of music and jokes
as the inhabitants of the ghetto try
to live their lives, and to maintain
their moral standards, but, i n its
evocation of the Yiddish theatre, the
action is faithful i n that the laughter
is tinged with tears, and the tears
with laughter. A l l the time there is
the threat of Kittel, the artistic,
sadistic Kraut with the habit of
popping u p everywhere. Kittel,
played by Alex Jennings, shares a
curiously k n o w i n g rapport with
Gens, a superbly gritty performance
by John Woodvine, which makes it
all the harder to accept the inevitable
conclusion, which extinguishes the
hope you share with the Jews.
A H the songs—some of which
survive f r o m V i l n a itself—are
peformed very well and some make
poignant set peices, such as Hayyah
singing of her sorrow that her man
has been shot, whilst the Nazis
enjoy an orgy with Jewish girls, a
bribe to save families. The clever set
gives a good impression of a
c r a m p e d ghetto, a n d the
performances are good, notably that
of L i n d a Kerr Scott, as a
ventriloquist's dummy.
The play also has a strong
message in it, insomuch as the
ghetto is a microcosm of modern-
day Israel. The Jews are i n conflict
over whether to fight out against the
Germans, and strive for their Zionist
beliefs, or whether to follow Gens
path of passive resistance. Gens
justifies the existence of the theatre
to Kruk by saying that only through
the pursuit of culture and moral
behaviour i n the ghetto will the
souls of the Jews remain clean, not
'riddled with their filthy disease'.
This ties i n with the author's
statement that, if the Jews in Israel
have taken on the beliefs of the
Nazis, they are spiritually dead, and
Israel is lost.
Ghetto perhaps introduces more
themes than it can reasonably cope
with in its three hours, but despite
this, it is the most moving play I
have seen about the Holocaust and
is highly recommended.

Fletoh Lives
With a four year break since his first
adventure, investigative reporter
I.M. Fletcher is back, determined to
worm his way into some villainy
and conspiratorial wrong doings
whether he likes it or not.
News from Louisiana informs
Fletch of an inheritance; his recently
ICSO
Funk Master
Chopin
Frederic Chopin was born. Years
later he died. In between these two
major events in his life, he wrote a
large a m m o u n t of music,
particularly for the pianoforte.
A m o n g these pieces were his great
works, Piano Concerto No 1, Piano
Concerto No 2 and a large number of
sonatas, followed a year later by a
large number of sonatas N o 2.
Chopin was Polish, k n o w n i n
piano playing circles as M r Sheen,
though today, there are only a few
surviving circles still able to play the
piano. He did not ride a motorcycle
nor did he play in goal for his native
Poland at Wembley i n 1974 in the
World C u p qualifying match against
England. H e did however, lose the
manuscript for his first piano
concerto whilst on a journey from
Warsaw to Paris. It was later found,
unfortunately he h a d already
published its sequel and called it
Piano Concerto N o 1. Luckily the
two stories were not intertwined
and only a few of the same
characters were involved.
Chopin, being dead, will be
unable to attend tonight's
performance of his second (or first
chronologically speaking) piano
deceased aunt's eighty acre
plantation called Belle Isle. Visions
of a languid existence in the South
attract him, and with typewriter and
suitcase-load of disguises, off he
goes.
The property is a tumble-down
wreck, overgrown and worthless.
Or so it seems, until a number of
strange characters impede upon the
tranquility and proceed to hound
Fletch into a sale. With a murder
spicing the intrigue, our hero has
something new to investigate.
Recreating his unpredictable,
eccentric lead is Chevy Chase,
swanning around the screen i n
numerous disguises worthy of Peter
Sellers, with his natural grin and
benign charm shining through.
Fletch Lives offers another ideal
platform for Chase's brand of
harmless wit and facetiousness, so
characteristic of previous outings,
Caddi/shack, National Lampoon's
Vacation and the like.
Director is once again Michael
Ritchie (The Golden Child) and his
experience through the original
Fletch should enable him to bring
out the best in Chase. Fletch Lives
was a box office hit in the U S
recently, and promises to do the
same here.
Release date: May 19
