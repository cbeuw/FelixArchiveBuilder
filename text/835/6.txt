Dear Marge,
Last time I wrote to you about
my e r m p r o b l e m w i t h
the....you remember...., and you
wrote back and told me about the,
uh, thingies. Well, I sent away to the
address you gave me, and the
'package' arrived yesterday. The
trouble is, I don't think I'm using it
right—1 keep getting electric shocks,
and I can't get the 'attachments'
clean afterwards. What should I do?
Confused in Computing.

Perhaps you are putting the
batteries in wrong. Anyway, latex

skin ailment. Try using less olive
oil next time.

perverted prank mail—it's really
disgusting. There are laws against
things like that you know.
Dear Marge,
I am terribly worried about my
daughter. I always thought w e
raised her well and now after just
a few months away from home she

Leave it off, mother. You know
I only do it for the money.
