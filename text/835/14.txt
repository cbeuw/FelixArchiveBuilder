RCS Initiation
Carol Luscombe, Gareth Smith (above) and Chas Randies were yesterday
formally initiated as next year's RCS President, Honorary Secretary and
Vice President. The ritual involves each being painted from head to toe in
the Union colours and being covered in a mixture including old milk, smelly
fish and tampons in tomato sauce known as The Mix.

Expelled
M r Jan Castelyn, the representative
of the South African Government
who addressed the Debating Society
last December, had been expelled
from the Country following South
Africa's abortive attempt to steal a
British Blowpipe Missile.
M r Castelyn was one of three
Embassy officials ordered out after
French police uncovered a plot to
smuggle a working model missile to
the South Africans. The missile had
earlier been stolen b y Ulster
Loyalists i n Northern Ireland and
had been offered to Pretoria i n
exchange for arms.
South African premier P.W. Botha
has apologised for the incident and
his foreign minister R.F. Botha has
emphasised that the three officials
were chosen at random and had not.

Plea
Chairman of the Undergraduate
Studies Committee, Professor Ewins
has issued a plea to students to fill
in the lecturer performance
questionnaires which are being
circulated t h r o u g h o u t the
departments.
Professor Ewins is concerned that
the results of the survey will be
rendered unrepresentative if
enough students do not complete
their questionnaire accurately.
"There are cases where only a
third of the students on a course
provide valid results', he said.
Although some departments have
been conducting their o w n lecturer
assessments for some time, the
standardised U S C surveys were
introduced throughout the College
last year.
The results of the questionnaire
will be processed by the College1
registry and the results will be used
by individual departments when
considering changes i n lecture
courses.
Bearman
Professor Bearman, Professor of
Experimental Aerodynamics will
replace Professor Davies as Head of
the Aeronautics Department from
September 1st.
The Department of Trade and
Industry together with the Science
and Engineering Research Council
have announced a three year grant
of a Â£365K for the development of
logical neural nets to Professor I
Aleksander of the Department of
Electrical Engineering at Imperial.
The programme is a collaboration
with the Department of Electrical
Engineering at Brunei University
and Computer Recognition Systems
at Wokingham.
The research is based on the
development of the 'Probabilistic
Logic N o d e ' (PLN) which was
invented at Imperial College. It uses
existing computer technology to
imitate the function of a human
brain cell. When many P L N ' s are
connected together to form a parallel
network they can be made to
perform complex recognition tasks.
The IC research group have
already developed W I S A R D , the
Wilkie, Stonham and Aleksander
Recognition Device w h i c h can
recognise images in 1/25 of a second.
The machine can drive a robot or
express a n opinion about the
identity of an unknown image, and
so it has a very wide range of
applications in industry. The system
has been used to recognise faces,
expressions o n faces, speech,
presence of intruders in secure areas
and production line parts.
The goals of t h e research
programme include the design of a
neural computer consisting of 16
million neural nodes,implemented
on a chip, which would be among
the foremost neural computers i n
the world. Such a machine would
be able to operate i n real time
processing difficult v i s u a l
recognition problems very rapidly.
Research will begin in May.
Display
The photosynthesis group i n the
Biology Department w i l l be
presenting a display at a Royal
Society Soiree on June 21st. T h e '
group, which is the largest i n the
country, will be presenting an
exhibition of their research into the
photosynthesis reaction using
pulsed lasers.
Style
Style is n o w the w o r d o n
everybody's lips, at least that's what
Grolsch would have people think.
They have n o w launched their
'Question of style' competition for
the second year, and are trying to
get as many paricipants as possible.
A l t h o u g h the competition is
sponsored by Grolsch, that is their
only involvement; no advertising
slogans or heavy purchases of beer
are needed.
The competition is divided into
four categories; creative writing,
song writing, fashion design and
photography. If you think that you
might be any good at one or more
of these, then an entry form can be
obtained from
Grolsch Question of Style,
Livewire,
Garden House,
The Cloisters,
8 Battersea Park Road,
London, SW8
Or you could phone 622 4055.
And
Finally...
A new beer has been launched
onto the market in France which is
claimed by its brewers to contain
special herbs with aphrodisiac
qualities. It is not yet available in this
country but when it is, FELIX
promises to conduct a full scale
scientific investigation into the
claims. A n y o n e w i s h i n g to
participate i n the scheme should
contact the FELIX Office. The Union
Bar has not yet said if it will be
putting in an order.
