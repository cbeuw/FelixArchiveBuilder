IViva India!
Bowel disorders are big topics of
conversation amongst western
travellers to India. Everyone has
them but everyone gets over them.
W e u ere possibly a bit foolish in that
we would eat anything anvwhere
.ind Malcolm paid for it by catching
gardia. This made cycling slightly
unpleasant, but nothing that a few
davs and lots of antibiotics couldn't
euro.
At midday we got o u r first
glimpse of the mountains rising
abruptlv from the plains. This sight
filled us with enthusiasm but the
seven kilometres a n d fourteen
hairpin bends, that it took to climb
the 400 metres to Nahan, soon
knocked that out of us.
We pulled into a dhaba that was
crowded with people listening to the
cricket o n a transistor radio.
E n g l a n d were being s o u n d l y
thrashed by India and there was a
gleam of satisfaction on the faces of
the men when thev saw us. Indians
seem to be very familiar with
English cricketers and we were
subjected to a continual stream of
jokes about the quality of English
play.
The dhaba wallah informed us
that there would be a festival to
celebrate the birthday of G u r u
\anak so we decided to spend the
day here. The interesting thing
about the festival was a large female
participation which we found rather
strange as we hadn't, up to this
point, seen any women taking part
in any kind of activity.
Next morning we set out for
Shimla. The road runs through deep
forests and high passes. There is
some incredible scenery to be seen
on this road, especially on the
stretch between Solan a n d
Kasumpati. W e booked into a
H P T D C (Homadhal Pradesh Tourist
Development Corporation) lodge
(but only after the usual hassles with
the local chowkidder). The lodge
was built over the edge of a ridge
and our room had the finest view I
had probably seen to date. It is at
times like this that w e started
ranting about the relative merits of
taking a year off rather than going
straight into employment. We both
felt that the experiences gained are
worth a lot more than t h e
advancement in a career.
O n reaching Shimla by this route,
there is a fine view of the town; pink
rooftops against the dark green of
the forest. The town is built on a
very steep ridge between Jakko hill
and Observatory hill. The first
houses being built by Livet Kennedy
in 1823. By 1928 the town was
established as the favourite summer
residence of the British. Indeed, the
buildings surrounding the Mall are
reminiscent of India's colonial days.
On arriving in Shimla we were
swamped by touts insisting that we
stayed at their hotel. Once the hotel
was decided a crowd of coolies
moved in and insisted that it was
necessary that our baggage be
carried for us. A few harsh words
and a dominating personality never
seem to do the trick in situations like
this.
Eventually we got, what must
have been, the shabbiest room in all
of Shimla (even though we were
assured that it had all 'mod cons').
The highlight of our stay i n
Shimla was a trip up Jakko hill
(2455m) from which there are views
of Shimla and the snow capped
mountains. There is a temple at the
top of the hill, dedicated to
Hanumanâ€”the monkev god. It is
famous for the monkeys that haunt
it and while here Malcolm was
attacked by a monkey which stole ,
a bag of peanuts out of his hand.
While this was happening an old
ladv who was almost bent double
with a child on her back, was being
harrased by a monkey pulling at her
handbag. She was screaming, what
I assume were H i n d i curses.
Fortunately someone saw fit to hurl
a stone at the monkev which then
disappeared into the forest.
It was now late November and a
man in a dhaba informed us that
Kashmir would be covered in snow
within the month, so we decided
there and then to get a bus to
Jammu.
Ten hours later we arrived in
Jammu, only it isn't Jammu. We had
somehow managed to arrive i n
Pabhenkot which is in the Punjab.
(A bit ironic considering we've
spent days trying to avoid the area.)
1 am informed bv the bus conductor
that the bus was diverted from
Jammu because of riots that have
just taken place there. We are now
expected to get a train to Jammu
from here.
Getting a train ticket in India is
difficult but slightly more so at four
o'clock in the morning and getting
a ticket for a bike as well is virtually
impossible. I left Malcom with the
bikes and picked mv way carefully
through the sleeping bodies that
littered t i e platform to the ticket
office. The technique to use in these
situations is; head down and barge
your way through.
After a great struggle I manage to
get two tickets to Jammu but the '
ticket vendor was convinced that
bicycles were never allowed on
trains. We found the guard of the
train and offered him a small bribe
if he allowed us to put our bikes on
but we were shocked when he
refused the money.
As the train pulled out we decided
to barge into the first class
compartment, bikes and all. All the
compartments were taken so we
settled down on the floor in the
corridor to sleep. At dawn we were
awakened bv an extremely mean
looking army official wondering
whv we were there. We explained
the previous night's events to him
while he tinkered with our bikes.
This seemed to satisfy him and he
disappeared back into his carriage
for another hours sleep.
At the station we were stopped bv
a guard who must have been given
information on us from somewhere.
We realised that this guard was only
out to extract a little money from us
so we gave him fifty rupees and
hurried on. Our next obstacle was
to get past the ticket collector at the
gate but this was nothing that 20
rupees couldn't solve. Leaving the
station w e were immediately
pounced on by a group of touts
trying to sell us bus tickets to
Sringagar. W e chose the most
trustworthy looking tout and we
were soon on the bus on our way
to Sringagar, the summer capital of
the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The bus ride from Jammu to
Srinagar is without doubt the most
spectacular journey I've
undertaken. Leaving Jammu to road
begins to rise a n d continues
upwards for the next four hours.
Passing round a high mountain
ridge at Pataitop the road starts to
descend and the brown roofed
mountains, peaked with snow come
into view.
Arriving in Srinagar the house
boat touts were out in force. Each
one trying to convince us that they
have exactly what we're looking for.
The houseboats come to be i n
Srinagar because in the days of the
Raj the British were not allowed to
own land i n K a s h m i r a n d a
houseboat seemed the best solution.
The boats are decorated in an
Edwardian style and it is easy to
spend days and days just lounging
on the houseboat and occasionally
going for rides in almost decadent
luxury in one of the local Shikaras
(a water-taxi).
Even in the middle of Dal lake it
is impossible to get away from touts
trying to sell you something. Thev
paddle u p i n their floating
hypermarkets and offer all kinds of
souvenirs.
Perhaps the summer, when tht
tourist trade isn't so slack, one can
get bv with a lot less harrassment.
