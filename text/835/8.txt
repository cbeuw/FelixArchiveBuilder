Rag Fete
Rag time rag fete
Tomorrow sees that great national
institution that marks the start of the
vear for Rag, the Rag Fete.
This is the last opportunity to raise
more monev f o r R a g . T h e
entertainment will be rather diverse
and will include everything from
viewing London from the top of the
Queen's Tower to stalls and a
chance to guess where the animal
will dump (more of this later).
During the afternoon this year's
charities will receive their share of
the £25,000 raised at the Rag
Reception.
The Fete itself starts at 2pm on the
Queen's Lawn. You can sample the
Roast Pig (which will have gone
onto the spit earlier in the day) or
possiblv a curry or a burger washed
down with a Pimms. After a quick
game of Splat the Rat or pelting
someone in the stocks you could try
vour luck at winning some of the
mind-boggling prizes on offer.
There will also be a tombola, and
from Guilds the H u m a n Fruit
Machine, 1 C C A G the Coconut Shy
and of course the Raffle with a first
prize of a microwave oven (boring
but practical).
The day winds up with what is
soon to become an Olympic Sport,
M u d Wrestling. This year's official
mud-wrestling coordinator is Hal
Calomvokis, so if you want to take
part purely for the gratifying effect
of getting covered in mud from head
to toe or because you are a closet
exhibitionist, get in touch with him
via the Union Office.
After all the general muck has
been cleared up, the Rag A G M will
be held in the Queen's Tower where
next year's offices and recipient
charities are chosen.
Anybody involved with the Rag
Fete should turn up at the meeting
today in the Union Dining Hall and
hopefully will attend the Rag Dinner
on the evening after the Fete.
This game is totally tasteless
Where w i l l the animal dump?—
devised by Links Club.
This competition involves an animal'
(breed to be announced) and a
circular area which is divided into
360 points at 5°/lm intervals.
The animal is tied to a stake at the
centre of the area and allowed to
wander. Each point can be bought
for £1 either in advance from the
Union Office or o n the day from
Links members. The winner is the
person whose point receives the first
anal blessing f r o m t h e
aforementioned animal (there could
be some collaboration with Chap's
curries to ensure that the beast is
needy). Prizes include a night out
with a pig and an all-expenses-paid,
turd clearing weekend.
