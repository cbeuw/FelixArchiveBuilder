OGGI
In October 1952, a fresher named
Brian Henrn arrived at I.C. Pew could
have realised at the time that here was
the biggest enigma that I.C. has ever
known: one dny the quiet and bashful
Brian, another the extroverted clown
Ogad: one day a great rugger player,
another a picture of l o l l i n g incompet-
ence: one minute sober, a minute later
reeling drunk on a couple of tomato
juices.
Before Baster 1955, the name Oggi
meant nothing to I.C. But at that time
the I.C. Bugger Club undertook i t s
f i r s t tour of Brian's home county of
Cornwall, and Brian waxed long and ve-
hement on the qualities of the Cornish
national Dish, the "Ogjd" which consists
of "great lunros of potato surrounded by
stodgy pastry, Just l i k e yourself, Brian?
From that moment the name was Oggi, and
i t stuck.
The cult of Oargl grew. In late Nov-
ember 1955, a student from I.C. swam the
Thames, and a DAILY KAIL front-page head-
line read OCCY SWIMS IHAMSS FOB A BET.
with a suitable a r t i c l e beneath. A month
or so later the BVENING STANDARD carried
a headline TOMAHAWKS FLY AT COLLEGE BALL,
followed by an astonishing description
of the Guilds Carnival where "..squaws
and Indian chiefs danced round 20 f t
totem poles. One chief swung h i s toma-
hawk too exuberantly and accidentally
scalped engineering student Brian Oggi.
who was rushed' to St 3eorge's Hospital1
;
Yet this Is the Golden Boy of I.C.
Bugger. B r i l l i a n t but unpredictable,
one day the Lester Piggott ef Harling-
ton, the next Coco the Clown (whom he
closely resembles when attired i n his
baggy blue pyjamas), with a horrible
habit of dropping the b a l l or f a l l i n g '
f l a t on h i s back when about to score s
i r j . In ths Cup matches of 1955-56, he
scored 18 of I.C.'s24 points against
King's and claimed a l l 6 i n the f i n a l
against U.C. Two weeks ago he scored
14 points i n I.C.'s f i r s t round win by
20-3. On another occasion the Wasps
were so smused Vy his antics that they
advised him to sign up for ths Harlem
Globetrotters.
As a erioketer, too, he i s a model
of b r i l l i a n t inconsistency. Five maiden
overs may be followed by two of rank
long hops. With the bat he can be a
dominant figure, as when scoring 59 i n
40 minutes to snatch a glorious one-
wicket victory against B.B.C. Plymouth
i n 1956. Two days later at Torquay he
skied the b a l l twice and was dropped,
then was clean bowled while over-balan-
cing i n his efforts to h i t a f u l l toss
out of the ground. Hs i s the only I.C.
Captain who has declared at lunch i n an
all-day game and than withdrawn h i s dec-
laration,
Oggi spent three years i n the Hostel,
where his activities frequently loomed
large i n the miserable l i f e of the Ward*
en. The culmination of his twentieth
birthday party was a procession round
Kensington, headed by an accordion play»
er and followed by a record number of
neighbourly complaints. Oggi miraculously
survived this and there was speculation
as to whether his hostel l i f e would be
prolonged beyond his twenty-first as
well. But this immortal occasion saw a l l
his guests recumbent at an early hour,
including Sunday disciplinarians. Oggi
is s t i l l a welcome v i s i t o r to the Old
Hostel, as J . Hoeksma and F.Irving w i l l
t e s t i f y .
Oggi gained a 2nd i n Chemical Eng-
ineering i n '55 —"spent too much time
playing c r i c k e t " — and i s now a learned
research student. His apparatus contains
a capacitance bridge, the balance-point
being found when the humming note i n the
loud-speaker reaches a minimum. I t was
wholly i n keeping that at f i r s t this
speaker emitted the B.B.C. Home Service
while his radio back at ths digs emit-
ted only a screech.
His hobbies include sketching and
writing poetry about "human wreckage
d r i f t i n g hopelessly through the streets'!
" A l l the world's a stage" and Oggi i s
one of i t s greatest comics. Certainly
I.C. would be 'Hie poorer without his
bonhomie and good humour.

"Wine i s not a childish sport:

"We must make eating more humane" was
the cry of the Committee.
So i t has been decided to investigate
the building of a small hatchway i n the
- a l l , go that the diners can themselves
return their empty plates. Ths sordid
justness of the scraping w i l l thus remain
out of sight and perhaps out of mind. The
'.rollers w i l l no longer be required, and
the diners w i l l be caused the minimum
amount of trouble. This i s surely more
satisfactory than the present arrangement.
Mr. Hallgarten l a a regular v i s i t o r to
the Society; his Germanic countenance and
guttmrslity of speech enable him to convey
the atmosphere of Ehinelsnd to his listeners.
He rendered great assistance i n ex-
plaining the hieroglyphics whlsn inevitably
appear on a l l German wine bottles. His
talk waa followed by a f i l m appropriately
t i t l e d Wines of Germany, after whioh the
main business of the evening oonmenoed.
Five wines were tasted; ths majority
young with a pronounced grape-bouquet
and an said tests. The last was a "boeren-
anslsse", one of the choicest of the Rhine
wines, combining finesse with the sweetnsss
of nectar.
Another problem confronting the Co
ittee was the extent of the cutlery and
crockery losses from the refectory. Mr,
Mooney's allegation that the Hostel may
be responsible has probably some element
of truth i n i t . (Hint; take 'em back
before Mooney swoops) . He quoted as a
typical example the disappearance of
dessert spoons. Out of a t o t a l of 280 at
the beginning of term , only 120 now
remain, (One hears that the younger gen-
eration i s spoon-fed, but this i s r i d i c -

SUCCESSFUL
SWEDISH EVENING
About 180 people came t o the Swedish
Evening, one of the best attended meet-
ings the International Relations Club
has held during i t s five years of exist-
ence.
The Concert Hall was well decorated
with travel posters and photographic
and handicraft exhibits. The l a t t e r ,
loaned by the Swedish Institute, con-
sisted of traditional Swedish Christ-
mas decorations, straw goats, stars and
wooden toys. The photographic exhibits,
mainly the work of Tony Eycott, at-
tracted a large number of people. The
photograph of the midnight sun (by A.
Halhomme) was also popular.
The proceedings began on the arrival
of the Swedish guests, most of whom were
female. The f i l m 'Roaming around Stock-
holm' was weU received although i t s
commentary was poor. 'Christmas i n Swe-
den' proved to be an unurcnal film, f u l l
of charm and thoroughly enjoyable.
Mrs. Xilburn gave an interesting
t a l k on Sweden i n general, and thus i n -
vited many varied questions (mainly
from P.W.Tress) ranging from the morals
of Swedish women to exemption from
National Service and income tax.
In the Interval the bar, a oonverted
table laden with Danish lager, was very
popular, a l l refreshments going very
quickly. Loud Swedish s i : ging provided
by the Chaps' followed the interval
with the guests i n popular demand.
The l a s t h5 mins. were taken up by
d u n n i n g . Many were sorry t o leave
whan the duty o f f i c e r arrived at 11.10
to c l e a r tha h a l l .
