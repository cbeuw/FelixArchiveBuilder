The College Administration has come under a hoary f i r e
of c r i t i c i s m , since the Inception of the Prince's Gardens
Residential Project he came known, for withholding inform-
ation and for their general lack of communication with the
outside world. On Tuesday next, i n the Concert H a l l , the
Rector and Mr Richard Sheppard P.R.I.B.A. w i l l speak at a
special College meeting on the plans f o r Prince's Gardens.
Models, samples of furniture and a number of photographs
and drawings w i l l be on view, and Br Sparkea of the plan-
ning offioe w i l l j o i n i n answering questions after the
speeches.
This i s the f i r s t opportunity that the College has had
of seeing and hearing the details of "...this fundamental
step i n the creation of a new and better Imperial College.
In fact, this Is the f i r s t 'public' meeting on the Prince's
gardens Project, and perhaps i t i s an indication of Admin-
istrative concern that members of the College should be the
f i r s t to know of possible future developments. Accordingly
we hope that future leaks w i l l come to PBLH rather than to
the MANCHESTER GOAHDIAH.

P L A N S Q U E U E C U T S
MT Mooney w i l l shortly begin an ex-
periment to prevent the enormous supper
queues which have of late graced the
Lower Refectory. The plan i s that he
w i l l guarantee a good selection of food
at any time between 6:00 and 7:30. In
addition the upper Refectory w i l l now
remain open u n t i l 6:30, which should re-
lieve some of the pressure downstairs.
The majority of I.C. students w i l l
agree that they do not indulge i n our
native habit of queuing for any patriot-
ic reason: they queue to be sure of a
meal, and who oan blaae them! I t Is
hoped that the experiment w i l l prove
that one can eat later and s t i l l have a
reasonable meal. Once this i s assured,
i t i s f e l t that most students w i l l pre-
fer to miss the rash.
This queue staggering w i l l benefit
both the student and the serving staff.
It i s earnestly hoped that TOU w i l l co-
operate with Mr Mooney i n what may prove
to be a costly experiment.
At the recent Refectory Committee
meeting the oleariag of refuse was also
extensively discussed; the present system
ef asraping the greasy remains from the
plates sate the trolley is very unpleas-
ant, affeaAing to the eye, the car and 1hc
nose, fas presence of the trolleys Is also
an ooeuaetieBel hasard for tray-bearl-f

An Exhibition was staged i n Senate House
last week devoted to the planning of both
academic and residential buildings i n Univ-
ersities. The soope was wide and covered
the whole of the western world, ranging
from English Redbrick, through Scandinavian
Colleges to the massive State and Private
Universities of the United States.
As f a r as London University was oonoer-
ned the sole example of t h e i r expansion and
rebuilding programme was Imperial's devel-
opment plan f o r residential accommodation
i n Prince's Gardens; design work on this
appears to be slowly materialising.
This scheme shows a high degree of
clear thinking i n the modern idiom, and
must be treated as a whole; the architects
Richard Sheppard and Partners are to be
congratulated on the revolutionary lines

they have followed. The three sides of the
Square that are going to be developed are
each treated i n a similar manner. With a
scheme i n whioh each building w i l l be hous-
ing anything up t o 400 students, something
must obviously be done to out down the i n -
terminable problem of corridors and this
has been b r i l l i a n t l y solved by designing
the building round that most English of
architectural features, the staircase.
The easiest way of understanding Shopp-
arda idea i s to study the building floor
by floor. The ground floor w i l l oontain
such things as refectories and other
communal f a c i l i t i e s ; the actual allocation
of f a c i l i t i e s does not seem to be f i n a l l y
decided. The f i r s t floor contains common
rooms whioh serve the residents who have
study-bedrooms on the second, t h i r d and
fourth floors; i n addition wardens' f l a t s
are included on this floor. The fifth floor
i s a repeat of the f i r s t , while the sixth,
seventh, eighth and ninth are repeats of
the lower block of three floors of study-
bedrooms.
By t h i s means one has obtained essent-
i a l l y two separate Halls of Residence, one
on top of the other. The crux of the whole
Batter i s i n the way each of those sets of
three floors have been designed.
On entering the ground floor the student
goes up to the f i r s t or f i f t h f l o o r by l i f t ;
he then passes along the common room gallery
u n t i l he ocmes to his own particular s t a i r -
case, he ascends this u n t i l he arrives at
his own particular floor. I t seaaa that
about eight rooms are arranged round east
landing together with ooaaunal bathroom
and t o i l e t accommodation. By this mrtinn
a cloeer unity ought to be obtained than
with the conventional type of n»n of
Residence. In each study-bedroom a long
window—seat i a planned, a floor area of
140 square feet i s believed to be that
used, and a wash basin i a also included.
The architects' sketch views of the elev-
ations and fsneatrationa are d i s t i n c t l y
interesting, and i t i a to be hoped that
they do not f a l l down i n the actual
cladding of the structure.
