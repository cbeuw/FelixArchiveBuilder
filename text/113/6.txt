ROOM DECOR
It Is often said that students of
soientific and teehnologioal subjeets
are Just human robots and lack the Inv-
agination and a r t i s t i c sense essential
to rounded personalities. Of course this
is just a l o t of propaganda put out by
narrow minded people with so called
" c l a s s i c a l " educations.
Of course we are not machines with-
out the g i f t of original thought. Ton
hare only to c a l l on any member of the
I.C.Hostel for instance, to see how by
eager endeavour his a r t i s t i c temperament
is explored to the f u l l - expressed i n
the decoration of his room.
This form of a r t i s t i c expression i s
only begotten by experience over the
f i r s t year or two of college l i f e . I n
order to promote this t r a i t the author
has here a few suggestions to make con-
cerning the more popular types of dec-
oration suitable for student bedrooms,
'though i t must be emphasised that or-
i g i n a l i t y of idea i s an essential part
of the whole thing.
Beer mats are perhaps easiest to ob-
tain, - you can pick up one or two at
each new pub. you v i s i t and you w i l l be
surprised how soon the space round the
top of your wall gets f i l l e d up.
Posters of any size or description
give colour and interest to your room.
Travel posters can be obtained at most
national travel agencies around Picc-
a d i l l y but you may have to use some
tact i n getting them since the available
stocks soon run low In the Autumn. The
best way i s to say that you are a geog-
raphy teacher and want them to i l l u s t r a t e
your lessons to the kiddies.
Theatre posters and programmes add
distinction to the room as do tube t r a i n
adverts and college hop and carnival
notices but i n the l a t t e r case take care
not to remove them before the function
advertised i s over.
unfortunately certain people i n Senate
House have made the aquisition of blue
helmets and bus stop signs rather harder
than a few years ago but naturally this
gives the aquisition even more value.
Coloured cartoons from P-HCH and other
magazines can be used at a pinch but cut-
outs from the EsQ,—E- calendar are more
pleasing to the (male) eye. However, i f
you are entertaining Aunt Fanny to tea
in the future, these had better be de-
tachable .
This brings up the thorny problem
of removal of such decorations. Some
landladies actually objeet to their
ceilings being plastered with f u l l
length portraits of Ava Gardner and
nay even have forestalled you with de-
corations of their .own such as notioss
bearing the legend "Lodgers w i l l be
hold responsible tor any damage to pro-
perty through the f i x i n g of ornaments
etc. thereon." There are three things
you oan do i n a oase like this:-
1. Have no decorations at a l l and
watoh the wallpaper peel off of i t ' s
own accord.
2. Experiment with various forms of
adhesive on the part of the wall least
l i k e l y to be noticed by the eagle eye,
3. Go ahead and l e t your frustrated
ereative instinct have f u l l rein.
If you chose no. 3 make sure you have
other digs fixed up f i r s t .
If you have some money to spare you
can buy one or two reproductions of clas-
s i c a l or modern paintings at several
galleries such as the Tate, the Phoenix
or the Jfedici. A large reproduction w i l l
cost something i n the region of 15/- or £1
For a special occasion why not buy a
bunch of flowers? Some real bargains may
be had from Covent Garden i f you get up
early enough. Naturally, members of
I.C.W.A. have flowers every day(as well
as goldfish) but I think this i s going
a b i t too far - although some members
of I.C.W.A. l i k e going a1
It too f a r .
These are only a few ways of decor-
ating your room, but even the President
of the Union w i l l no douby agree, i n
spite of the euphonium and television
set i n his room, that the best deooration
for any room i s the presence of an att-
ractive member of the opposite sax.

I*XI STILL UNBEATEN
The l s t XI Is s t i l l maintaining a 100*
record, although two of the last four mat-
ches have been won only by the odd goal.
On Hov. 6th I.C. beat Westminster Col-
lege 5-0 i n -Hie f i r s t round of the U.L.
Cup, The opposition was not strong: our
chief rivals In the Cup this year are l i k -
ely to be U.C. who we meet i n the next
round on Dec. 4th,
On Hov. 9th the lst XI just held on
to a half-time lead of 3-0 to beat Eeble
College at Oxford by 3-2. This i s a re-
versal of previous matches i n which 2nd
half ascendancy has been a feature. I t
shows that we could s t i l l be f i t t e r .
On SOT, 13th I.C. beat King's 3-0
and on Hov. 16th beat Hendon 2-1 i n spite
of four of our men playing that day for
the University.

V I S I T S R U G B Y
On the 13th of November ten members
of the I.C. Hallway Society paid a v i s i t
to the Locomotive Test Plant at Rugby.
After an uneventful Journey up to Rugby
in the "Royal Scot" they were f i r s t shown
round the Motive Power Depot, ancient
but Interesting, where a number of loco-
motives i n various stages of undress
were explored.
After lunch the party went down to
the Test Plant. This i s a large and :
highly specialised laboratory, opened
in 1948, where any type of locomotive
can be tested i n every conceivable way.
(although there are no records of any
engine - as yet - being tested to des-
truction) . Although the plant was orig-
i n a l l y intended for steam locomotives
only, i t i s now working more and more on
other types: the one seen on test i s
s t i l l on the secret l i s t and cameras
were not allowed.
Some time was spent i n the oontrol
room, which i s allegedly soundproof (!)
and some fascinating gadgets were inspect-
ed. Built into the middle of the vast
control panel (which i s loaded with
instruments of awesome accuracy) i s one
ordinary domestic barometer, labelled
"Set f a i r " etc. i n Te Olde-type letter-
ing. One wonders i f i t says "Rain" when
steam engines start priming on the bed.
It was a delightful and unusual
v i s i t , made even better by our partic-
ular ly hospitable guide, newly arrived
(with a number of stories) from I r i s h
Railways.
THAT LIFT
The l i f t i n the Union l a s t i l l suffer-
ing from periodic disorders which are at-
tributable to nothing more than gross
over-loading. Csses have occurred of 12
people being trapped i n i t . The l i f t i s

tinue, action w i l l be taken to prevent a
larger number getting i n .
