REBIRTH OF
THE PHOENIX
The four", sub-editors of THE PHCENTX
have recently drawn up a report on l t a
present situation. The need for, and aims
of, THE PHOEHIX are discussed and detailed
suggestions made for future improvements.
Prom conversation with students froa
other universities, one gains the impres-
sion that I.C. i s l i t t l e more than a re-
l a t i v e l y advanced technical eolleg* —-
beyond s c i e n t i f i c prowess and-euccesse'a
in the f i e l d of sport we are'nothing.
It i s a prime duty of THE PHOENIX to
destroy this conception - those copies
which i r e sent to other colleges1
and un-
i v e r s i t i e s must show the other aspects of
I.C. students, i t the same time, however,
THE FHOEHTX must be made Interesting and
attractive to the students themselves.
Tha sub-editors have suggested a con-
siderable number of improvements that they
think need to he made before any voluntary
increase i n circulation can be expected
(the sales c e i l i n g i s about 1700, but act-
ual sales are of the order of 800 at pre-
sent) . They propose, among other things,
that i n future THE PHOEBTX should include
a 'theme' supplement, something after the
fashion of the spasmodic PUNCH supplements
on the Motor Show, the Close Season, etc.,
possibly In the form of a 16-page dummy
pull-out.
The report recommends that i n future
articles should be commissioned from past
subscribers, there also being i n each
issue a b r i e f invitation to students to
submit c r t i c l e s . The practice of publicly
begging f o r material i s to eease - i t
serves only to make readers aware of the
paucity.
It i s advised that THE PHOEHIX should
not attempt to report news, and be more
careful with p o l i t i c a l articles than i n
the past - In the summer of 1949 i t was
forced to admit that I t had been publish-
ing a i l y very left-wing articles. The
society reports should be merged into a
single article on College a c t i v i t i e s ,
with brief mentions of the outstanding
events.
There appears to be scope f o r a more
Imaginative use of space."it present every
page has f u l l width columns, with a t i t l e
at the top and the author's name at the
bottom. This suggests a bankruptcy ef imag-
ination on the part of the person respon-
sible f o r layout? I t i s suggested that some
pages be divided Into two columns and that
type faces and headings should be variedi
the cover too should be treated In a more
eiroulatiou-eenaoioua Banner. Some of these
suggestions have been incorporated i n the
present issue.

GUILDSMEN FREED
The two Guildsmen arrested i n Exhibit-
ion Boad on Morphy Bay appeared before the
magistrate the following aorning, charged
with insulting behaviour.
The constable who gave evidence said
that he had seen these two opening a car
door, but one of them then pointed out
that the Police had not arrived u n t i l 15
minutes after the incident. The Polioe did
in fact admit that the arrested men had ha
been picked oat at random, and the Magis-
trate had no alternative but to discharge
them, which he d i d .
The Magistrate asked the two Cuildsmen
to report i n the College Magazine that
goodnatured rags very seldom gave rise to
any serious trouble, but hooliganism such
as this was looked upon very seriously by
citizens i n general, and by the law i n
particular: these sentiments are heartily
endorsed by Dave Stevens.
HONOUR SATISFIED
BOAT CLUB IB" SPOBT RACES V. KING'S
In an interesting fixture, which was
by nature of a duel, the Boat Club com-
pletely defeated King's College Boat Club
both In water and i n beer.
The fixture arose i n order to regain
the Boathouse Plag, which had been stolen
by members of King's 2nd T i l l on Morphy
Day. Five crews participated i n the race,
which took place on the afternoon of Wed-
nesday, November 15th, the I.C. 3rd T i l l
and King's 2nd T i l l having a two lengths'
start on the I.C. 1st and 2nd and the
King's 1st T i l l s . The course was from the
University Boat Race Stone to the Mile
post, and the f i n i s h i n g order was I.C. 1st,
I.C. 2nd, I.C. 3rd, King's 1st, King's 2nd.
In the Thames bar afterwards there
followed a beer boat race, King's being
again defeated. The f l a g was returned i n
a pure T i r g i n state, a f i t t i n g testimon-
i a l to I.C.'s supremacy i n the l i q u i d
sports.
