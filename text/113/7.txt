CIRCUIT TRAINING
For the past few years, C i r c u i t
Training - a new form of progressive training
for physical fitness - has been arousing
Interest i n t h i s country and overseas. Ths
possession of a healthy body i s a prime
necessity i n this modem age i f we are not
to break down under the strain of l i v i n g ,
and this i s especially true i n the case of
the hard-working student. The ideal:
•Mens sana i n oorpore sano' i s too often
forgotten. Circuit Training (C.T.) meets
this need i n the physioal education of
students, and was i n fact evolved i n the
gym of the University of Leeds.
I t i s a medical fact that the best way
of developing a healthy muscle i s to exer-
cise against an ever-increasing resistance,
and there i s no better way of dJJing this
than weight training, increasing the number
of repetitions performed, or steadily
increasing the poundage used. The bar b e l l
system i s ideal, since the weight can be
easily adjusted by as l i t t l e as -
J
- l b . at a
time.
Weight training i s now used as a basio
training for a l l pports . Examples of
sportsmen who claim that t h e i r suocess 13
largely due to regular doses of "iron
p i l l s * can be found everywhere. Famous
athletes include Chris Brasher, Gordon
P i t i e , Brian Shenton, John Savidge,
Pharoah, Ian Anthony, Emil Zatopeck, etc.
The athlete who does not use weights i s the
unusual type. Swimmers l i k e Mike Breckneil
t r a i n regularly with weights, as do C3r
clists
Reg. Harris Dave Bedwell, C y r i l Peacock.
Many f i r s t division Soccer teams include
weights i n t h e i r training schedules...
Rugger.. Rowing..Need we continue ? For
the benefit of the IC Musical Soc. Guy Mit-
c h e l l i s a regular weight trainer as well.
Weight training i s used as a mean3 of
physioal culture ( body-building techniques
used to build the physique to the best size
and strength) as a sport i n i t s own right
(weight l i f t i n g } and i s also extensively-
used as a remedial treatment (rehabilitat-
ion). The improvements possible are very
rapid and have to be seen to be believed.
(Not usually quite as quickly as Ch-rl-s
Atl-s promises, though!) The fourth use
of barbells i s the comparatively recent one
of C.T.
At present the c i r c u i t i s open i n the
Snack Bar every evening at 5.00pm. or 5.30
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I f you are
interested, please come down one evening
and have a look at the oircuit. Enquiries
from beginners and unfit men ( and women)
especially weloome. I t would be
appreciated i f non-sportsmen would use the
Wednesday training period so that overcrowd-
ing i s avoided.
The main purpose of this a r t i c l e was
however to draw the attention of non-sports-
men to the value of c i r c u i t training for
reaching and maintaining a reasonable
standard of physical strength and endurance.
No s k i l l i s required and the exercises are
graded to suit a l l types. Another advan-
tage i s that the c i r c u i t can be completed
i n less than half-an-hour.
The IC. c i r c u i t consists of n _.e simple
exercises whioh are l a i d out round the room
The training rate, i e . the number of repe-
t i t i o n s carried out on each exercise, i s
taken as one t h i r d of the maximum rate for
each exercise, whioh i s the number of repe-
titions which can be performed i n one minute.
When training one passes from one exercise
quickly to the next i n an anti-clockwise
direction u n t i l three laps of the circuit
have been completed.

VICTORY OVER U.C.
I.C. overwhelmed U.C. recently,
winning by 10 matches to 2. In the top
foursome, Mills and Wallace won comfortably
but Constable and Scriven were much too
casual and onLv won on the last creen, a
result which did not truly refleot their
superiority. Anderson and Parkinson,
however, gave nothing away, winning well out
i n the country, while Butters and Oxley made
i t 4-0.
The procession continued i n the after-
noon. M i l l s , demonstrating the golf that
has established him as the University's top
player, won easily, and Wallace, turning
5 up, met a determined counter-attack bvat
weathered the storm and eventually won by 3
and 2. Constable, i n determined mood,
thrashed his opponent and the captain,
Parkinson, won easily, as did Anderson and
Scriven,
Butters, however, encountered
s t i f f opposition and went down by 4 and 3
i n the face of some excellent irolf. Oxley
also lost, to give U.C. their only other
win.
SWIMMING
I .C. had mixed fortunes i n the
match against Battersea. An early
success was gained i n the only swimming
event, the medley relay, where steady
performances by Harford, H i l l s , Loveman,
and Beckett trained a comfortable victory.
The l s t . polo team were apparently not
inspired by this, and did not settle down
aeainst a hard-tackling side. An early
roaX for Battersea unsettled I.C. and
despite having a goal disallowed, the side
never quite had the measure of their
opponents. Battersea scored as the ref.
was blowing for half time and f u l l time,
and the f i n a l score was 7-4.
The 2nd. team rained a resounding
victory, winning 8-1. Beckett acored 3
quick eoals and the team then scored at
regular intervals. Beckett eventually
scored 5, Harford 2, and a long-haired
individual (i.e. the skipper) 1.
Prospects for the league look brlaht
for the 2nd, team, but the l s t . team w i l l
have to improve their play a l i t t l e .
