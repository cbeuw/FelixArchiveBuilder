LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
PUERILITY
Members of the Union w i l l doubtless
hare noticed the markings that hare appear-
ed on the lawn i n the quadrangle. They were
burnt into the grass with creosote, some of
which has penetrated to the roots. As a re-
s u l t , that part of the lawn w i l l have to be
returfed. Since the winter i s now upon us,
this cannot be done u n t i l next A p r i l at the
e a r l i e s t .
This wanton destruction, obviously pro-
meditated, i s hard to understand. One as-
sociates the 'scribbling on walls' mental-
i t y with backward school-children, not
Members of an university, es the c u l p r i t s
presumably are.
THE PHOENIX
The importance of THE FHCBHTX to this
College can hardly be over-emphasised. Con-
sidered purely as an advertisement of I.C.,
i t deserves f a r more thought and effort
than i t has been wont to reoeive i n the
past. I t i s encouraging, therefore, to note
the refreshing attitude of the report sum-
marised elsewhere i n this issue. The sub-
editors have produced new ideas, not only
with regard to the contents, but also the
typography and layout. There i s plenty of
o r i g i n a l i t y and Imagination In I.C.s at.
l a s t we have some signs that they are find-
ing their way into THE PHOENIX.
We are glad to note that Tony Hodgson
i s bask i n our midst once more, and wish
him a speedy return to f u l l mobility.
WANTED
E d i t o r i a l staff required. PELLX urgently
requires production helpers. No previous
experience necessary, although a b i l i t y to
type would be an asset. Come along to the
next make-up In the PXLTX room (on the Srd
f l o e r of the Union, opposite the l i f t ) on
December l s t and help us to deliver PELIX
o 114 into this horrible world. I t Is hop-
, 1 that this Christmas issue w i l l contain
12 pages, and any contributions w i l l be
gratefully received.

MIKE presents his Limerick Competition,
Headers are invited to construct a Lim-
erick, the f i r s t line being:

They w i l l be Judged at the PBLTX danee l a
the Coaoert Hall on tho 50th. She winning
entries w i l l earn a prise (small) sad fame
(enormous).

and families may not take part. Bribes
will he accepted,
Dear S i r ,
After numerous letters on stud-
ent dress and behaviour at Hall Dinner
and other aspects of these Tuesday-night
niceties have appeared i n FELIX, I f e e l
that some close inspection of Hall Din-
ner i s not untimely.
Each week the Upper Dining H a l l ,
S.C.H. and, on occasions, the Beading
Room, are given over to the crowd of
crawling backalappers basking i n the
candlelight under the approving aegis
of the College.
I feel that this attempt to promote
social intercourse between students and
the other members of the College has de-
teriorated to such a level as to be only
worth considering i n the same l i g h t as
"business luncheons'.' Lfey I request
through your columns that we as students
endeavour to change this bourgeois res-
pectability that dominates Hall Dinner,
and hope that i n future there w i l l be a
hearty amiable atmosphere and that the
stuffed shirt brigade w i l l charge for
the better.
Yours etc.,
Benediotus Benedicat.
ADAM I MAC AM
Dear Editor,
On Wednesday November 6th I
found myself reclining i n a muddy puddle
on the banks of the Thames. Five lusty
Guildsmen were endeavouring to remove my
trousers, while five more were determined
that I should go for a swim. As I vainly
fought the thought struck me that any
sane person would not allow himself to
be i n such a position, and yet, there I
was. I could only conclude, i n despair,
that I was insane.
But wait, dear E d i t o r , this i s more
serious than you suspect, for i s not i n -
sanity inherited? Then my father i s quite
mad, and his father before him, and so
on, u n t i l i t occurs to me that Adam was
stark raving bonkers. I f , S i r , this i s
the case, so were a l l his children and,
by simple genetic laws, so i s the com-
plete human race. You, S i r , are an idiot'.
X remain,
insane,
Bruce Cobnuts.
Editor's note: Nonsense!
I C W A C A N ' T S T O M A C H IT
Dear S i r ,
Have you noticed how slim we
have been lately?
It i s not because we are dieting.
It i s not because we are impecunious.
It i s not because the food i s bad.
It i s not because there i s no food.
It i s merely because
Ian Charles Robertson has apparently
collected his outlery after the last i s -
sue of FELIX.

BILLIARDS
Dear S i r ,
In view of the fact that I was
appointed Chairman of the B i l l i a r d s Room
Committee several weeks ago I would have
liked to have been informed of Mr. Hodg-
son' s letter re B i l l i a r d s by yourself
rather than read i t for. the f i r s t tine
i n FELIX. However, I would l i k e to thank
you for your comment.
Mr. Hodgson i a right i n that block
bookings have been made, but that these
have been made by any o f f i c i a l to do
with the b i l l i a r d s room i s not eorreot
and much was the wrath I had to bear
because of i t .
For the benefit of Felix readers
I would l i k e to point out that I am
doing my best to keep the situation i n
hand as they w i l l find i f they read the
notice board i n the B i l l i a r d s Room. I
f e e l however, that the best way to run
the B i l l i a r d s roon i s by means of a club
(social, not ancient-British-type hard)
which I am In the process of forming.
If any member of I.C.Union i s i n -
terested i n joining such a club would
he or she please sign the notice on the
'Internal' board i n the main h a l l of
the Union?
Yours f a i t h f u l l y
M.A.Webb
Chairman, B i l l i a r d s Room Ctte.
VIOLATION
Dear S i r ,
I was disgusted to note on Mor-
phy Day that certain people i n thia Col-
lege did not honour the agreement between
the constituent College Unions that the
mobile mascots should be inviolable during
rags and at a l l other times. The pelting
of Clementine with flour i>nd rotten f r u i t
can possibly be blamed cn exuberant fresh-
ers not knowing of the agreement, but i n
the ease of Jesebel having 'mud' thrown
at her while she was standing outside the
Union, freshers can obviously not be blam-
ed.
I hope, S i r , that oertain of jour
readers w i l l take note, and that such
regrettable incidents w i l l not recur.
Yours etc.,
I.M.Plummer.
CHURCH SOCIETY
Dear S i r ,
In reply to Mr Royoe's letter i n
the last issue of FELIX, the leaders of
S.C.H. and I.C.C.U. agree that the Church
Soeiety has i t s place i n the College. In
any case, the C.U., with 75 members, i s so
large that i t must s p l i t into eells i f i t
i s to grow There are other Christian
cells i n .he College (Dr Cameron's, and
one or more i n R.C.S.) and one, now the
Church Society, which grew up as as out-
post of the Chaplaincy to U.L. This l a t -
ter c e l l has a new, keen oomnlttee and a
mailing l i s t of 88 Anglieans not i n CtU.
or S.C.H, - and we have scarcely started
looking for them yet.
A l l we want i s permission to use the
College's name, and to use naiioe bean's
and Union rooms. We are not ambitious to
join S.C.C., and we intend to raise our
own maaey from members.
Yours ainserely.
Peter Evans
Chairman, Church Society.
