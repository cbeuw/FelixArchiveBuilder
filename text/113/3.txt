GUILDS CLEAN UP
AFTER LORD MAYOR
OH WHY AEE WE ?
For the tenth time, the Film Society
has emerged from a six month period of
hibernation and bankruptcy. How, granted a
new lease of l i f e by the Union Treasurer,
i t faces yet another season of breakdowns,
cancellations and h a l f - f i l l e d auditoria.
One may wonder why the Film Society
exists at a l l . Founded i n 1948, audiences
i n the early years reached astronomical
figures - i n the region of 200-300 - and
often shows were held twice nightly. How-
ever, since those propitious days, the
Society has reoeived a number of setbacks.
F i r s t , the advent i n 1951 of the Nat-
ional Film Theatre sounded the death-knell
of the Society, a blow from which logic-
a l l y I t should never have recovered
NO P R O J E C T O R
In the second place, the Society does
not possess i t s own projector. I t there-
fore borrows one from the College Author-
i t i e s , and must hire a projectionist ap-
pointed by them. Financial considerations
apart, this means that the Society has no
control over the quality of projection.
Older members may remember an evening when
the projectionist gave a capable demon-
stration of almost every technical fault
that can possibly occur. His efforts were
not appreciated.
Thirdly, the Society has been hounded
round the College, from one unsuitable
h a l l to another. Perhaps the most notorious
was the main Chemistry Lecture Theatre i n
the E.C.S. In order to increase the volume
of sound, the loudspeaker was placed i n
front of the microphone of the public ad-
dress system. The result was that those
who sat at the front could hear the loud-
speaker perfectly but were too olose to
ths screen. Those at the back of the the-
atre had an excellent view of the soreen,
but could only hear a loud booming sound
and the whirr of the projector. The smart
Header w i l l now ask "Why not s i t i n the
middle?" But here the audience was so dis-
tracted by the antics of those at the front
who could not see, and those at the back
who could not hear, that they never sat
there twice.
PSST
The f i n a l blow came when the f i l m dis-
tributors banned the s e l l i n g of tickets at
the door. Tickets must therefore be sold
In the Union. There were speculations on
the meaning of the phrase "at the door?
Within what distance of the door was one
not actually at i t ? 20 ft...30 ft...300
yds...§ a mile? One could imagine furtive
ticket vendors, lurking i n the shadow of
the Boderlc H i l l Building.
The attendances at the f i r s t two shews
this season suggest that this period of
hardship has been only temporary. A major
reason for ths change of fortune must be
the luxury of the new Chem. Eng. Lecture
Theatre i n which our shows are now held.
Those who have experienced the comfort of
this h a l l of culture have enjoyed i t . Why
not you?
The formation of a University Jazz Band
i s always a d i f f i c u l t matter: keeping one
together i s even more d i f f i c u l t . Last year
there was a f a i r l y successful jazz band i n
the college but at the beginning of this
term i t was found that two of the most im-
portant members of the band were missing,
the trumpet and clarinet players, so that
any new band formed would have to start
v i r t u a l l y from the beginning , building
up a repertoire of numbers and rehearsing
them into a playable condition.
Freshers' Day brought a l i s t of about
t h i r t y musicians interested i n playing
jazz and from these we managed to ob-
tain musicians experienced enough t o f i l l
the vacancies i n the old band. The new
band i s very similar i n style to last
years and may be described as "traditional1
'
with leanings towards Chicago style, but
employs a somewhat unusual front l i n e of
four - two clarinets, trumpet snd trombone,
leading four rhythm. I t i s f e l t that the
addition of an extra clarinet produces a
f u l l e r tone than i s normally produced with
the standard three front l i n e . The band
has played at Saturday hops i n the college
and i s going to play at Guilds' Carnival
and at the Jazz Club hop on November 2 3 r d .
There also exists i n the college a
"New Orleans" style band which i s having
some d i f f i c u l t y i n obtaining musicians,
and a s k i f f l e group which played at Har-
lington on Nov. 5th. I t i s also intended
to form a quartet playing a more modem
style i n jazz; such a group would be the
f i r s t one of i t s kind i n the college.
Once again the band i s going to play on
Sunday afternoons i n the Nucleus Coffee
Bar, 9 Monmouth St. The Nucleus i s a fav-
ourite haunt of Jazz musicians, and mem-
bership of the club entitles one to attend
all-night jam sessions on Saturdays, The
band also hopes to play at the Nucleus
during the Christmas vacation.

This year Guilds were again represented
i n the Lord Mayor's Show, having been i n -
vited to man some of the Floats and t o
provide bodies for other tasks. 27 Guilds-
men assembled i n Sun St. Barracks,near
Moorgate, to change into costumes of many
shades and styles,and to regale themselves
i n a t i r e suitable t o the windy, but not
too o d d weather. The efforts of the two
heralds t o obtain pleasing tones from
their bugles met with a mixed reception,
especially from the W.R.A.F. band who
were standing immediately behind the. p r i n -
c i p a l Guilds float awaiting the start of
the procession.
Once the procession moved off the cold
was forgotten amidst the shouts and laugh-
ter of the crowds - much provoked by the
s t i l l unpractised efforts of the heralds,
The rear of the procession was brought
up by those redoubtable Guildsmen Mike
Gorb, Syd Lenssen and Jon Blok i n charge
of the the traditional dust oarts^ That
they were thoroughly enjoying themselves
was evident from the laughter of the
crowd and the bruises on the nether of
Gorb, who was hurled from a hand dust
cart i n front of the Mansion House by an
over eager Blok. The even earned their
keep by'sweeping up Arundel Street after
the many horses had passed on their way.
The usual reception was enjoyed as the
Advertising float passed the Spanner, Davs
Stevens and Guilds down Ludgate H i l l , i n
the shape of a Booraalaka, with drummers
drumming. Heralds bugling and Postmen shout-
ing i n chorus.
A most excellent lunch was had by the
participants when they arrived back at Sun
St. John Hobson silenced the London School
of Printers and King's - who were also
somewhere i n the show - with quite a witty
speech of thanks to the organisers, cal-
culated to j u s t i f y Guilds and confound the
"others" i n the eyes of those present.
There followed a most energetic and heart-
quailing Boomalaka i n traditional Guilds
style, led by Tice President John Sheldon.
It can f a i r l y be said that Guilds have
made their mark on yet another Lord Mayor's
Show, and, by their enthusiasm and wit,
provided the crowd with quite a spectacle
not least the walking figures and commas,
who confessed to being somewhat troubled
by their loads and the wind, but otherwise
provided their own spontaneous show. The
whole a f f a i r was most enjoyable, and
Guilds are looking forward to next year
and another show.
