BOXING CLUB WIN U.L. TRIALS
At the U.L. t r i a l s on HOT. 7th. a
strong contingent of I.C, borers succeeded
i n winning the Blott Cup. (Unfortunately
the Cun was " l o s t " some years aeo and we
were not able to bring i t back with us.)
Of the seven contests , I.C. were repres-
ented i n f i v e and won three.
In the f i r s t contest of the evening,
K i m l a n i , althorn* lacking experience, beat
an obviously unfit opponent on points i n
no uncertain style. In tbe next bout Ycrke
gave an impressive display to win against
a boxer who had the advantage i n size, and
i s to be congratulated on his s k i l l and
toughness; the referee stopped the fight i n
the third round to prevent what would
probably have been a K.O.
Gordon Halsey, I.C. Captain, f i g h t i n g
the man whom he beat i n the t r i a l s last year
made good use of his greater reach to hold
off a very determined opponent, and won on
points, i n the best contest of the evening.
A fresher at I.C.Jim P i a t t , boxing as
a lirtit-heavy, gave a very good performance
and seemed certain of winning, when i n the
t h i r d round he caught a w i l d right swing on
the jaw which nearly K.O.'ed him, and the
referee stopped the contest a few seconds
later to prevent his opponent finishing off
the job. With more experience i n the art
of defence he should uphold the honour of
I.C. well i n the future.

I.C. soundly beat the Royal Veterin-
ary College i n the f i r s t round of the
U.L. Cup, due mainly to the courage and
fitness of the forwards.
The f i r s t half was closely fought,
with honours just going to the Vets.,
who managed to convert a penalty just
before half-time to make the score 3-0
at the interval. Right from the start
of the second half the I.C. forwards put
on a great display and began to get the
better of the Vets. pack. The b a l l was
taken into the Vetsl half when a penalty
was awarded to I.C. f o r a loose scrum
infringement. Fly-half Hearn converted
to make the score 3-3. This put heart
Into the I.C. team, and f i v e minutes
later another long-range and f i n e l y -
angled penalty by Hearn put I.C. 6-3 up.
The I.C. pack was now r e a l l y on top and
play took place mainly i n the Vets!
h a l f i with their attacks being broken up
by good covering.
Tbe I.C. forwards now took the b a l l
at t h e i r feet and dribbled over the VetsI
l i n e where Gilbert beat a Tats, man to
the touch-down with a splendid dive. The
try was not converted and the score waa
now 9-3. Hearn then added a further 6
points to the I.C. score with a drop goal
and another penalty, both good kicks. The
f i n a l score f o r I.C. earns from a three-
quarter movement starting on the I.C. 25,
the threes sweeping through the opposit-
ion and sending winger Gibson over f o r a
try which Hearn converted.
The date of the second round of the
Cup w i l l shortly be announced and the Rug-
ger Club w i l l be running supporters'
coaches — so come along and support I.C.
The team:
Peart, Smith, Berrynan, P h i l l i p s , Gibson,
Hearn, Lens, Wronaki, Riley, Evans,
Burns, Crosier, Wright, Gilbert, Parker.
Mike Clarke, that bearded veteran of
I.e. boxing, provided much material for
the wits i n the audience, but was unable
to overcome his opponent and lost on points.
It was good to see a large crowd of
I.0. men watching the contests and lending
vociferous aid to the participants;
perhaps some of them would like to come
along on Friday nights at 5-30 pm. to the
gym, where the boxing club holds i t s
training sessions, and we are always ready
to welcome new members, with or without
previous experience.

i n crediting I.e. with 4 wins; the error
was due to a mistake i n the programme.

The Club has now passed the half-cen-
tury of matches played. The record so
far achieved i s 40 matches won, 1 drawn,
and 12 lost and 229 goals have been
soored to 123 against. During the l a s t
fortnight the 3rd XI lost their f i r s t
game, leaving the 4th XI the only team
s t i l l unbeaten.
The 1st XI have been playing const-
ructive football i n recent matches, and
have generally outplayed their opponents
but many chances at goal have been was-
ted. This was particularly evident when
I.0. lost 1 - 3 to a strong Corinthian
Casuals side. I.C. had most of the play
particularly i n the second half when Ca-
suals were reduced to 10 men, but wasted
chances lead to our heaviest defeat of
the season.
In the other two matches played since
the last issue I.C. reoorded two wins,
2 - 1 against Wimbledon 'A' and 5 - t

CROSSCOUNTRY
On Wednesday November 6 ^ IC. was not
only defeated f o r the second time within
a fortnight by Kings^ but also outnumbered
even on the home course. As before, the
defeat was due to the close packing of the
Kings' men but the individual winner was
J. Conway of IC. who had the incentive o f
being the o f f i c i a l soorerl
However, the 9 t h . of November was a much
more encouraging day, as IC. produced two
f u l l teams f o r the f i r s t time this season.
The second t3am,including some " o l d lags"
turning out f o r the f i r s t time,did well t o
beat Goldsmiths'easily over a d i f f i c u l t 5
mile course. The f i r s t team,which was not
nearly as strong as i t should have been,
competed i n a major f i x t u r e i n Loughborough.
The team result was disappointing, as IC
was not only beaten by superior opposition
from Manchester, Birmingham and Loughboro',
but also by LSE. and UC. Nevertheless,
some of the individual performances were
praiseworthy. John Collins was sixth i n
a f i e l d including some of the best runners
i n UAU. J . Conway was 11 In gaining a place
i n the UL. f i r s t team, and AL. Brown, 28th.,
was awarded a well-deserved place i n the
UL. second team.
On Wednesday 12th., IC. were shamefully
defeated by QMC. a result due solely to the
poor club turn-out of members who would
otherwise have gained places i n the middle
of the f i e l d . As usual we provided the
f i r s t man home due to a magnificent effort
by John Collins,who completely l e f t the rest
of the f i e l d , achieving the s t i l l rare time
of under 29 minutes.
I t i s {-ratifying t o see the consistently
keen support of the lower second team mem-
bers who are turning out for a l l fixtures.
Finally, over the notorious cuurse a t
Parliament H i l l Fields on November 16, the
second team gave one of i t s best performan-
ces to f i n i s h Second to Guy's Hospital,
but defeating UC. ,Bcrcugh Road, and
Institute of Education. J.Jaeger, f i t a t
l a s t was Jrd., and other IC positions were
8 t h . , 1 2 t h . , i t t h . , 1 4 t h . , and 1 8 t h . , show-
ing that even IC can practise packing.
The UL. Championships into whioh i s i n -
corporated the annual battle between RCS,
Mines and Guilds, takes place on December7.
This event has always been characterised
by a large entry from 10., including
competitors running f o r their constituent
oolleges, who do not normally compete.
We again invite these"oasuals"to turn out
(no previous experience required)
