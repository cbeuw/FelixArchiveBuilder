Commemoration Day "blunder"
BY ALEX FEAKES
Imperial College's 1996
Commemoration Day celebra-
tions were salvaged from disaster
last week when they were
rescheduled for the 31st
October, instead of the 24th.
The Registry Division responsible
for the ceremony had overlooked
a mistake in the booking of the
Albert Hall in what was
described by the Rector, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, as a "gross blun-
der. "
Commemoration Day, when
graduating students receive their
degrees, is traditionally held on
the closest Thursday to the 25th
of October, which allows the
Albert Hall to be booked for the
event years in advance. However,
this year the graduation ceremo-
ny is pencilled in for the 31st
October instead of the 24th, a
fact that nobody in Registry dis-
covered until recently, when
preparations for the ceremony
and the Ball following it were
well under way.
In particular, invitations to
the event had already been sent
out, and Imperial College Union

have had to move the £90 a pair
Commemoration Ball forward a
week. ICU narrowly avoiding a
repeat of the May Post-graduate
Ball debacle in which they
incurred a penalty for cancella-
tion at short notice due to anoth-
er Registry mistake.
Efforts were made by the
Registry to solve the problem,
but they were unable to move the
date to the 24th October. Speak-
ing to Felix, Vernon Mclure, head
of the Registry Division since the
beginning of May, confirmed that
they had made efforts to "sort it
out," but plans to move the event
to the 24th were scotched when
a pop group booked into the Hall
for the week before were unable
to move. Questions remain,
though, as to why three weeks
went by after the blunder's dis-
covery before Registry notified
anybody of their mistake.
The Rector was told last
Wednesday, and apparently
unimpressed by the situation
declared that "those who [made
the mistake] would have to sort it
out." Sarah White, ICU presi-
dent, described the affair as "very
unfortunate" and said that it was
"lucky that it happened in time
for the students that were leav-
ing," though it was too late for
overseas students.
ICU sources put the cost of
the Commemoration Ball in the
region of £15,000, which is nor-
mally covered by the double tick-
et price of £90. However, it is
now doubtful whether or not the
overheads of the Ball will be met
from ticket sales alone. Sarah
White, incredulous that the
Registry had made yet another
mistake, suggested that some of
the cost of the Ball may be passed
on to the Registry.

In a move marked as a "sad day
for students," the London School
of Economics' academic board
voted to recommend the princi-
ple of top-up fees to its governing
body as a way to reduce a pre-
dicted £3.7 million deficit.
If implemented, the LSE
would become the first universit-
ty in the UK to charge top-up
tuition fees for EU students. The
vote, 43 for and 12 against,
reverses an earlier decision not to
support the fee.
Estimates for the size of the
fee have ranged from a prelimi-
nary figure of £850 to a £3500
charge which would recover the
School's budget deficit. Other,
short term measures had also
been agreed by the academic
board, including raising the fees
for overseas students and reduc-
ing staffing costs by 4%.
Claire Lowrie, LSESU's
treasurer, commented that
"Tuition fees should be an option
of the very last resort," and sug-
gested that poorer students and
those from less privileged back-
grounds would be put off coming
to university. However, the
Director of LSE, John Ashworth,
said that "as [LSE] are an inter-
nationally renowned centre of
excellence, we must not let our
reputation be damaged by the
reduction of state funding."
Imperial College officials
have consistently denied that IC
would begin to charge top up
fees. However, it remains to be
seen whether the London School
of Economics' move will start a
domino effect of high-flying uni-
versities succumbing to top-up
fees, and whether or not Imperial
College will be able to resist
these pressures.
