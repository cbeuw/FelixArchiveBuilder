Suggestions for a final editorial, suitable for all occasions
Dear Felix,
I and the rest of the band "Urban
Spice" were very suprised to read
that our performance at the union
on February 9th had won an
award as we didn't know we'd
been entered (Feiix 1060). We
would like to thank STOIC for
sending the tape in and selflessly
taking all the praise on our behalf.
We must all congratulate
STOIC on their success as so many
unscrupulous people these days
would not ask the band before
entering a video of one of their
gigs into a competition now would
they?
Urban Spice (Simon Wilkins,
Stefan Finch, Rick Aldred, John
Martin, Russel Stothard)
P.S. Do you know they
charged us Â£10 for a copy of the
video too!
Dear Felix,
I am extremely disappointed at the
quality of your news reports. The
article on the Iranian Society ban
in last week's Felix (issue 1061)
was full of inaccuracies, misrepre-
sentations and even spelling mis-
takes.
First of all, I am not sure what
your news team mean by the "inci-
dent in the Huxley building".
Despite hot weather, poor air con-
ditioning system and a late start
imposed by the college security,
the lecture went extremely
smoothly, and no particular "inci-
dent" took place.
Secondly, I found your
description of Dr Soroush (not
Sonosh!) as someone who "is
known to Scotland Yard" extreme-
ly offensive and derogatory. Dr
Soroush is an internationally
renowned thinker and philosopher
who has been invited to some of
the most prestigious academic
institutions in Europe and North
America. In any case, the fact that
he spoke here at Imperial College
can only add to the college's inter-
national reputation.
I very much hope that, in
future, greater care is taken fo
ensure that college news is report-
ed accurately and without distor-
tion.
Yours sincerely,
A member of the audience

Dear Felix,
'We are sensitive to exam pres-
sures, although some students
may not believe that.' Ian Caldwell
is so sensitive to exam pressures
that as Head of Estates he allows
the library to be taken over by
workmen intent on making the life
of those studying inside a misery.
Considerable numbers of stu-
dents were so disrupted in their
study over Easter Vacation by the
horrendous drilling beneath
Southside that some of them had
to be given a second room in
Weeks Hall. Maybe the fact that
they have been monetarily recom-
pensed leads Ian to the conclusion
that he is 'sensitive' to student
needs.
The latest, and most sicken-
ing incident of college's blatant
disregard for students is the
recently exposed 'Week's inci-
dent'. It just happened that work
started at 8am each day and that
a 'Let's impress the high and
mighty' event was due to occur a
few days later. The story may have
been believable at the time, but
how is the dispassionate Director
of Estates going to live this one
down?
If he is willing to stand up for
what he did - and justify it - then
maybe he deserves to be listened
to, otherwise the man is exposed
as a fraud. At the very least Felix
should investigate every word of
what he says before believing that
the man is ever out for students
rather than his precious VIP's and
the plaudits of His Royal Highness
the Rector.
Yours,
Disgusted of Southside

Dear Rachel,
COMMEMORATION DAY 1996 -
CHANGE OF DATE
Please note that the date of
Commemoration Day this year has
had to be changed from Thursday
24 October to Thursday 31
October due to the Albert Hall
being unavailable on the earlier
date.
Yours Sincerely,
Jackie Sweet
Assistant Registrar
a) One last irritable snipe back
at the enemy
There are a few final ends to
tie up: the Warden of Selkirk
and Tizard Halls was quoted in
an ambiguous context last week,
for which I apologise. When he
said that "there is no security in
Halls other than that which the
students provide themselves" I
think he was trying to say that
we are all responsible for those
we let in. He was certainly not
expressing any lack of confi-
dence in security staff. But I
have to say, Dr Hassard, that I
would feel much more inclined
to offer an apology if I had got
the complaint directly from
yourself, rather than second
hand.
b) Luwie tear-jerker
Mum and Dad: thank you
for supporting me through it. I
promise I'll get a proper job now.
Inky: it's been fabulous.
c) Straight forward apology
I'm sorry: I tried to meet
the students' complaint of "too
boring!" and the staff complaint
of "too sensationalist!" and failed
at both. I'm moving on now -
time for someone else to have a
go-
maybe you all had very high
expectations for what is still just
a students' newspaper. If the
Iranian Society speaker's name
was misspelt, maybe it was
because someone spent hours
trying to track down a knowl-
edgeable source before giving up
to go to his Aeronautics lecture
instead. We're tried our best.
e) Bid for freedom
Look, lighten up, will you? If
you're not going to take it all
with a pinch of salt and a healthy
set of expectations, then I'm off.
Up north to make girders lor
British Steel, actually. Wouldn't
touch journalism with a ten-foot
barge pole ever again.
I) Littlc-kid-meets-VIP awe
There was something
tremendously inspiring about
meeting the Rector. Somehow,
and I don't know how, he made
me feel really proud to be part of
this tremendous institution.
g) Genuine nostalgia
I'm very, very tired right
now, but I'm still not looking for-
ward to saying goodbye to it all.
I've had superb fun... and you
know, there are bits of it I'm
quite proud ol.
d) Pathos-laden bid for the sym- h) All of the above,
pathy vote
It's been really, really diffi- Thanks for bearing with me.
