Karian resigned to no confidence
ULU President quits to preempt QMW motion
BY ROBIN RILEY
The University of London Union
president Ghassan Karian ten-
dered his resignation in a letter to
the University of London Union
General Union Council on
Tuesday, pre-empting a vote of
no confidence in his presidency.
Mr Karian had partially with-
drawn from the presidency much
earlier, on May 17th, when he
accepted the offer of a position as
West London elections cam-
paigns co-ordinator for the
Labour Party. Ghassan was con-
tinuing his administrative duties
as president, but was no longer
drawing a salary from ULU. The
apparent conflict of interest led
delegates from Queen Mary and
Westfield College led to the pro-
posal of no confidence in the
president.
Dissent was strongest at
QMW following an incident ear-
lier in the year when Ghassan
fiercely criticised their NUS con-
ference delegates, who had been
mandated to support his New
Solutions (for funding higher
education) proposal, but ignored
their mandates and voted against.
In retaliation, QMW students
voted to ban Mr Karian from
their Union premises.
Speaking to Felix, QMW
sabbatical Anthony Hume ques-
tioned Ghassan's motives in
pushing through both 'New
Solutions' and the new ULU con-
stitution, in light of his new posi-
tion. He also expressed anger at
Mr Karian's lack of accountability
to the students he represented,
who had been paying his wages
for at least the majority of the
year. More specific complaints
included Ghassan's refusal to call
a G U C meeting until forced, his
contravening of the ULU consti-
tution in holding the two jobs at
once, and his failure to give the
required one month's notice
before resigning.
These arguably trivial com-
plaints may have led to Ghassan's
description of QMWs Union
officers as "petty politicians, who
have nothing better to do than
grind their axe," (Felix 1061) but
Mr Hume was adamant: "We
hold the moral high ground, I
feel, without a shadow of a
doubt."
In Ghassan Karian's absence,
ULU Vice-President Tara
Jefferson has stepped in as acting
president until the end of July, in
a brief interview with Felix, Ms
Jefferson was downbeat and
expressed her frustration at the
course of events, claiming "It was
brilliant when he was doing the
work and not getting paid... We
were getting maximum value out
of Ghassan." Ms Jefferson went
on to express her dismay at Mr
Karian's forced resignation, and
denied rumours that she too
would resign.
Concerning the objections
raised by QMWs Union officers
regarding Ghassan's policies now
that he was working for Labour,
Ms Jefferson said "Perhaps they
should have tried harder to win
those arguments at the time."
However, when pushed on
whether Mr Karian's overt politi-
cal affiliation was appropriate,
Ms Jefferson conceded that the
other ULU sabbaticals were all
either apolitical or Labour Party
members themselves.
Under the U L U constitu-
tion, the motion of no confidence
still had to be discussed at the
G U C meeting even though
Ghassan's resignation rendered
the result entirely academic.
Ironically, the motion was defeat-
ed by the narrow margin of two
votes, so Mr Karian would have
remained U L U president had he
not resigned. However, Anthony
Hume, the motion's original pro-
poser, claims that if this had been
the case, stronger arguments for
sacking Ghassan would have been
put forward and the result would
have been radically different.
The repercussions of Mr
Karian's resignation may well
continue into the next academic
year. Sarah White, ICU presi-
dent and U L U president elect,
will be denied the usual handover
period of training by the outgoing
president. This could conceivably
knock-on to the incoming ICU
president, Eric Allsop.
Ultimately perhaps only
Ghassan Karian himself can claim
any victory from these proceed-
ings, as his rapid rise within the
Labour Party seems assured
despite the souring of his term as
ULU president.
China to England by tandem for IC duo
BY ALEX FEAKES
An expedition by a post-doctoral
researcher and her boyfriend who
cycled from China to England
reached its conclusion a few
weeks ago when the couple final-
ly arrived to a champagne recep-
tion in Ramsgate.
Dave Montain, a technician
in the Physics Department, ini-
tially received the suggestion
from his girlfriend Bronwen with
surprise. Bronwen was nearing
the end of a year's research in
the Chinese capital, Beijing, and
wanted to take the opportunity
to do something adventurous.
"I'd been saving up for some-
thing like this for a while," Dave
recalls, "but when Bron suggested
it, I was a little surprised." - nei-
ther of the pair are dedicated
cyclists. The idea grew on him
and he attended a course on bike
building, and built their own tan-
dem.
For the first month of their
year-long trip they stayed in
Beijing, then headed south
through Vietnam, across to Nepal
Dave and Bronwen met a Pakistani homeopathic doctor who cycled
around the world in the sixties.
and India. They travelled through
Pakistan and Iran, which Dave
described as "brilliant" and some-
where he would like to go back
to, and then to Turkey. Everyone
they met on their travels was
friendly, and willing to help the
unusual travellers. It seemed that
everywhere they went they
attracted attention, and were
often chased by curious locals. In
one Indian town they nearly
caused a riot as onlookers crowd-
ed around.
When they reached Europe,
they found that this feeling of
being 'special' soon wore off, but
they were glad nonetheless when
they disembarked the cross-chan-
nel ferry at Ramsgate and were
greeted by Bronwen's parents
with champagne.
