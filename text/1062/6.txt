T h e O u t s a n d Ins o f '95 - '96
Andrew Dorman-Smith cuts the losses of the year, and sees what we've been left with.
1. The RCS I
I Building
Out (eventually): RCS II
Every year a number of subjects
seem to reappear in Felix with
such regularity that you wonder
if they will ever disappear. Last
year it was the unending spree of
computer thefts and the on-off-
on N U S referendum. This time
College estates developments
dominated the news.
While the proposed exten-
sion to the IC's boat club premis-
es at Putney may have been one
building project which featured
prominently, it was another of
the Estates projects which really
shone out as the issue that could
not be avoided in 1995/6.
IC had been fortunate to
obtain adequate funding for a
new Imperial School of
Medicine, but the logistics of the
scheme didn't appear to follow as
happily. As meaty arguments
between the constituent medical
schools and College continued
over the provision of social space,
planning applications were caus-
ing concern. The old RCS II
building should have been demol-
ished by Christmas 1995, but it
was still standing three months
later. English Heritage weighed
in because the site was a desig-
nated 'Conservation Area', and it
was mid-March before 'Green
Light for BMS' graced the front
page of Felix.
We were told of a wall of
silence from college authorities as
they plotted and planned in an
attempt to wrest ICU from its
grip on the high revenue potential
of Beit Quad. Since Biology
would be departing to enter the
new Biomedical building, the
logic was that ICU should follow
the botanists and zoologists out
of the way, but this time into the
sumptuous surroundings provid-
ed by the Sherfield building.
ICU sabbaticals and officials
were not particularly receptive to
College overtures, with one
'senior official' suggesting that
there would be a staff sit-in if any
pressure was brought to bear to
vacate the Quad. In what was to
be the first of many incisive quo-
tations Sarah White, the then
newly elected President, said that
she was "extremely cross."
Communication started to
improve with an "amicable yet
frank meeting" between the
Director of Estates Ian Caldwell,
and the four ICU sabbaticals. But
it seemed that rising costs had
more to do with College's even-
tual decision to put the plans 'on
hold' than ICU's preferences.
Still on the ICU agenda was the
adoption by College of the 'Beit
Option', enabling the Union to
expand into some of the space
vacated by the Biology
Department.
Elsewhere on campus,
preparations for the new library
extension began with the appro-
priate degree of controversy. The
first stage of the developments,
excavating the concrete-filled
basement, untactfully started as
the third-term exam season got
underway. "We think the worst is
over," the Rector said.

2. Rag
Richard Willis, elected as Rag
Chair at the A G M in June 1995,
opened his year with a blustering
attack on the return without
compensation of a pilfered mas-
cotry item. 'It's a bloody dis-
grace' he shouted as Felix showed
Reggie, King's College stone lion,
being handed back by the Royal
College of Science.
The Rag man had barely set-
tled into his new job when he
himself graced the front cover
with a report that he had given
away whisky and vodka at a
fresher's reception. The matter
was highlighted when one inebri-
ated newcomer was found in a
'barely conscious state' by a
College official. Happily the stu-
dent recovered.
Mr Willis was less fortunate
as he found himself subject to the
full force of the disciplinary
might of the Union, brought on
in part by the embarrassment
caused by the incident. While a
technicality and an appeal looked
like delaying his departure, the
Rag Chair eventually preempted
the outcome of the censure
Out: the heady days of charitable success
motions by resigning.
It was just two weeks later
that they were once again in the
headlines, this time with even
worse news. A missing Â£300 was
the subject of this latest contro-
versy as the rudderless group
struggled to come to terms with
"the mentality of someone who
would steal from charity."
Jon Lambert took the helm,
without a noticeable improve-
ment to the group's fortunes.
There was an incredibly poor
turnout at the normally boister-
ous Mines Dirty Disco as part of
a similarly disappointing Rag
Week. Even the famous Beer
Festival, a highlight in many IC
student calendars, was under
subscribed as the trend contin-
ued.
The final nail in the coffin of
what must be one of their less
auspicious years came with the

Rag Fete at the end of May. This
has traditionally been held on the
Queen's Lawn to show apprecia-
tion to those who have cam-
paigned throughout the year and
to raise even more money. With
rain forcing the event inside, the
crowds failed to materialise with
a pitiful six students visiting the
stands - a miserable end to a mis-
erable year for Rag.
