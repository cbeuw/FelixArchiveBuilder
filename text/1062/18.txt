cold meals which are both edible and affordable?
I think not.
/ loved, I laughed and cried, I had myfill, my
share of losing. Up until recently, the fortunes of
the England football team had closely followed
my stunning success on the National Lottery.
While I still throw money away on a weekly
basis, the expected upturn following the replace-
ment of Anthea Turner by Bob Monkhouse hav-
ing failed to materialise, the boys with three lions
on their shirts are now playing better than I can
ever remember. The stunning demolition of the
Dutch last week was incredible, and the sound
of Rule Brittania bellowing out of Wembley was
deeply moving, and now as tears subside, I find
it all so amusing. To think they did all that, and
may I say, not in a shy way, that game will go
down as one of my greatest sporting memories,
and I am sure I am not exaggerating. By the time
you read this we should be in the semi-finals,
having despatched Spain, but let's not tempt
fate. On the basis of their current form, they
could and should win it, which would give the
country an incredible boost and remove the self-
doubt that many have about Britain (or should
that be England, as my Celtic flatmate has
observed?). We can but hope. If they do win,
John Major could do worse than call a snap gen-
eral election to take advantage of the rampant
feel-good factor which would sweep the country.
It worked for Harold Wilson after 1966 and I see
no reason why it wouldn't work again.
England's resurgence on the football field
could not have come at a more opportune time,
given the beef ban and the resultant tide of
Euroscepticism. Those of you who have closely
followed this column will realise that I am as
likely to jump into bed with the federalists as
Elle Macpherson is to jump into bed with me
(realism had to dawn eventually), as over the
year I have had cause to question the path which
has been chosen for Europe by France and
Germany. It is frustrating that the debate in
Britain is split between the extremes of mone-
tary union or out, both of which are very dam-
aging aims. We are accused of anti-European
behaviour over the beefban, but let us not forget
the way that France helped prop up the entire
GATT Agreement to secure what it wanted for
its farmers, almost causing the collapse of five
years of painstaking negotiation. I refuse to take
lectures on co-operation from countries whose
self-interest is so fiercely defended regardless of
anything.
And that's yer lot, kids. May I thank every-
one who has read my humble prose over the
year and especially those who have commented
on it with ideas, criticisms or praise. Oscar Wilde
was absolutely right about being talked about. It
has been very enjoyable and, I'd like to think,
made a few ripples on the Imperial pond.
For what is a man, what has he got, if not
himself then he has not. To say the things he tru
feels and not the words of one who kneels. T
record shows I took the blows and did it my
Yes, it was my way.
•a summer reading listsa ulnl.s
Looking through the four bookcases which I can
now justifiably call my 'library', I am reluctant to
single out those books which I like a lot from
those I like a little less. What follows is not so
much a list of favourites as a selection of recom-
mendations, and if you notice a propensity
towards a certain genre, you are correct. I make
no apologies.
Whatever you read, have a good summer!
Iain Banks: The Crow Road
The 'archetypal' Scottish Novel, of a young man
finding his way and the settling of old family
feuds. A mixture of the macabre, black humour,
a few deaths, and an atypically upbeat ending
make a very readable novel.
John Brunner: Stand on Zanzibar
If you want to understand the origin of 'road
rage', then this chronicle of overcrowding is very
convincing. The unique style, which uses
extracts fromfictionalbooks, takes a while to get
used to, but pays off. And I wish there really was
a book called 'You're an Ignorant Idiot'.
John Crowley: Little, Big
Sleep, dream and the lethargic pace of life are
the basis of this story of Faerie in the modem
day. What really distinguishes this book are the
embellished pages and the language: "The room
seemed larger than it was, or was smaller than it
looked, he couldn't decide which."
Simon Ings: Hotwire
Sentient cities, manufactured organisms and
technology-ambivalent societies are the scenery.
The foreground is a story ofmisunderstood love,
and the blurring of the distinction between nat-
ural and manufactured.
Ursula K. LeGuin: The Dispossessed
The story of one man's development of a meta-
physical communication theory, set against the
juxtaposition of two ideologically opposed soci-
eties. As each system tries to manipulate him, he
becomes convinced that neither is best. LeGuin
argues that solutions are not found in ideals.
Nicholas Royle: Counterparts
The lives of an aspiring actor and a tightrope
walker are interwoven through dreams and
other blurrings of reality- Although very readable,
it's not for the squeamish.
Neal Stephenson: The Diamond Age
Although somewhat tongue-in-cheek, this novel
of education in a high-nanotech, stratified society
still has real ideas to discuss.
Kurt Vonnegut: Slaughterhouse 5
A man is forced to confront his memories of the
Dresden firebombing. The possibly heavy phi-
losophy is digestible due to the self-deprecating
style, and the "so it goes" refrain.
Roger Zelazny: Doorways in the Sand
Aliens disguised as marsupials, a Mobius-twisting
machine and an eternal student. If you want
weird and wacky, they don't come much more
so than this.
