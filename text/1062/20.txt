-film: beyond the clouds
Beyond the Clouds is made up of four stories
about tragic love. Short scenes, narrated by and
starring John Malkovich as a film director, link
each story seamlessly.
Story 1: Chronicle of a love affair that never
existed. As the production notes puts it, "The
strange story of Carmen (Ines Sastre) and
Silvano (Kim Ross-Stuart) whose sexual desire is
so strong that the act itself is a desecration".
They have both been touched by love, despite
only meeting twice in three years. Their love
remains unconsummated at their reunion and
Silvano leaves Carmen undressed on the bed.
Story 2: The girl, the crime. A director
(Malkovich) meets a sales assistant (Sophie
Marceau) in a shop. Fleeting glances (between
the two) turn to uncomfortable stares. He
leaves, she follows and she tells, "I killed my
father - stabbed him twelves times".
Story 3: Don't look for me. A married man
(Peter Weller) has an affair with a young woman
(Chiara Caselli). Exasperated by his inability to
decide between his wife or the young seductress,
his wife leaves him. She moves into a rented flat
and meets Carlo (Jean Reno) whose wife has just
left him and taken all the furniture with her.
Story 4: The body of dirt. Vincent Perez
chats up Irene Jacob and walks with her to
church. He suddenly wakes up in the church
and desperately searches for her, he catches up
with her and asks "Can I see you tomorrow?",
she answers, "Tomorrow I...".
Depending on the way you look at it, the
endings are either tragic or incredibly amusing.
Despite being four separate stories the under-
lining tone ol Beyond the Clouds is melancholy
mainly due to Malcovich's thought provoking
narration. This film is about love, and its novel
approach makes for an interesting view.
"film: beautiful thing ,: ,,
If I had to name the worst part of Beautiful
Thing, I'd have a hard job deciding between the
soundtrack and the ending. Very much a feel
good movie, it tells the tale of Jamie (Glen
Berry) and Ste (Scott Neal), two teenage boys
who fall in love. Two straight actors play the main
parts and give a realistic edge to some of the awk-
wardness of the early steps of realisation, but the
film's biggest fault lies in the speed and simplicity
with which they come out. If anything the plot
belittles the (difficulties the boys would face in
reality, especially in the uninviting setting of the
33hamesmead estate.
Coming out would be so much simpler if all
mothers got used to the news of a gay son as
quickly as Sandra (Linda Henry). There is a hor-
rendously naff wailing violin soundtrack, with
some Mamas and Papas thrown in from next-
door neighbour Leah (Tameka Empson) and her
drunken antics, but if you can ignore it the scat-
tering of humour brings out a good laugh. In fact
it is the humour which saves the film, with some
excellent one liners from Sandra's prat of a
boyfriend Tony (Ben Daniels). And the ending?
Well, the less said the better.
-video: jack and s a r a h t
Rchard E. Grant (Withnail & I) plays Jack, a
successful lawyer married to the pregnant Sarah
(Imogen Stubbs). After moving into their new
house and having a house-warming party at
which Jack gets hideously drunk, Sarah goes into
labour. In the ensuing panic Jack is knocked
unconcious. He awakes later to be told that
Sarah has died giving birth to a baby daughter,
whom Jack names Sarah. At first Jack turns to
the bottle for comfort, but his parents soon
make him face up to his responsibilities by
leaving baby Sarah with him. During his adjust-
ment to fatherhood he hires Amy (Samantha
Mathis) an American nanny with too little expe-
rience in looking after small babies, resulting in
several arguments between her and Jack. After
regaining his feet Jack begins dating again but it
is only when Amy leaves, having told Jack she's
fed up with being taken for granted, that Jack
realises how much he has come to love Amy.
Richard E. Grant plays the middle-class,
prospective father in the typical way: appearing
flustered, over-protective, and totally unpre-
pared for fatherhood. Dame Judi Dench plays
Jack's mother a woman, who has no faith in her
son's ability to cope with a new-bom baby and
certainly doesn't agree with his choice of
babysitter.
The film, although dealing with rather tragic
circumstances takes a rather light-hearted view
of it and has some extremely fonny scenes, the
dialogue including some wonderfully timed sar-
castic one-liners from Jack.
This video is well worth checking out if
you're after a video which requires the min-
imum of concentration to follow the story-line.
