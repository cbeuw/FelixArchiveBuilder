3. Ghassan
Karrian
The Rag politicking was nothing
when compared to the machina-
tions at the University of London
Union. Following close behind in
the 'most mentions' category was
that long-serving friend of ICU,
that unavoidable Ghassan Karian
(formerly called the ULU
President). You could hardly
have missed his transformation
from 'friend of IC to 'villain of
the year.'
It all started with a soft
focus study of a rather drunken
Mr Karian and even more inebri-
ated Sarah White - ULU/IC
relations seemed to have a bright
future. The Labour Councillor
was pushing his initiative to over-
turn the NUS policy of fighting
for a return to 1979 grant levels.
He was not alone, with ICU's
President attending his 'New
Solutions' group in an unofficial
capacity. What could possibly
stop this budding relationship
bearing fruit for both parties?
The cooling-off started in
February, when Mr Karian
attended a ICU Council meeting
which was debating his proposal
for a new ULU constitution.
With accusations of "half-cocked
appeasement," but still with the
support of other ULU sabbati-
cals, his proposal was eventually
accepted.
Next in the ULU/Karian
saga came the revelation that
ICU's own Sarah White was bid-
ding to become Karian's succes-
sor. A result of 35-23 in Ms
White's favour, even if she did
think that it was "A bit closer'
seemed a good omen for an ever
closer relationship between the
two Unions. But nobody was
ready for the final slide into the
mire through which student pol-
ln: all alone
Out: friends together
itics seems only too happy to
travel.
'New Labour' connections
had been well-documented in
previous issues, but Mr Karian's
employment by Tony Blair's
party came as a shock, especially
as he still had two months of his
contract to finish. Breaking
agreements clearly did not pose a
problem for the soon-to-be
Labour spindoctor.
"I just don't understand
him," Sarah was quoted as saying
in one of her analyses of events
surrounding the debacle. The
problem was that the ICU
President would have limited
training for her new role which
the July handover period was
supposed to provide. So far had
they travelled from their drunk-
en intimacies at the beginning of
the year.
Worse was to come as Ms
White was hard-pressed to stop
ICU Council from forcing her to
propose a motion of no confi-
dence in her former friend. A
compromise whereby she would
support a motion only if it was
proposed by others seemed to
have got Sarah off the hook.
With friends rapidly falling
away from the previously-popu-
lar Karian, the ICU compromise
looked increasingly meaningless
as a motion of no confidence
became inevitable. The ULU
President was now on the attack
calling his opponents "petty
politicians who have nothing bet-
ter to do," insisting that he
"would prefer not to have to do
two jobs anyway."
The year of friction drew to
a close with Ghassan Karrian
resigning his position before the
vote of no confidence went
ahead.
4. Higher Education Funding
Beyond Imperial, the national
debate on the future funding of
higher education came to the
fore this year. We learnt in
December that Imperial was to
lose £2million through the gov-
ernment's decision to transfer
money from higher education to
the primary and secondary sec-
tors.
While Gillian Shephard was
'trumpeting' the action, those
who had lost out were under-
standably feeling somewhat inse-
cure. The Rector of Imperial
College described the cuts as
"derisory," and one vice-chancel-
lor went as far as describing them
as "an act of vandalism bereft of
any strategic direction."
As some of the hardest hit
universities were openly debating
top-up fees as an alternative
source of funding, opposition was
mounting. The rather uncoordi-
nated spectacle of the Durham's
SU President suggesting one
move, while Manchester's
Student Union leader suggested
another, may not have evoked
optimism, but help was at hand
from a rather unexpected party.
That well known opponent
of student poverty, Her
Majesty's Tory Government,
scared of losing even more of its
falling middle class vote, moved
in behind the students against
the universities. They insisted
that there was "no need for top-
up fees," and expressed concern
over the suffering that tolls
would cause those students from
"less well off families." The Pro
Rector suggested that the
Government was "getting other
people to do their dirty work,"
but College authorities admitted
that they were seriously consid-
ering how top-up fees could be
imposed.
The political
posturing increased
as a divided
Committee of Vice
Chancellors and
Principals decided
to impose top-up
fees in the run up to
the next Genera
Election. Imperia
College's Rector did
Out: fat of the land
not support this move, insisting
that "IC has no intention of
charging a £300 fee."
Whatever the real feelings of
this disparate group of University
and College heads, the desired
effect was achieved with the
Secretary of State for Education
being manoeuvred into an
embarrassing 'backtrack' by the
high profile campaign. With dis-
agreements between Govern-
ment Ministers themselves, the
Tory's education 'policy' looked
in increasing disarray.
But while Richard Wilson, of
'One Foot in the Grave' fame,
was getting elected as Rector of
Glasgow, the National Union of
Students had greater issues to
consider. The great funding
debate - whether the NUS
should still demand a return to
1979 grant levels - continued to
dominate proceedings at student
gatherings.
When Douglas Trainer, the
moderate Scotsman, was elected
to be next year's President, it
looked as if last year's decision
would be overturned. With the
ubiquitous Mr Karian insisting
that, "The [present] policy is
unachievable and will not address
the problems we face," the long-
standing, and much-criticised,
policy was summarily aban-
doned.
In: let them eat cake
