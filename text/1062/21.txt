album: the blue nile -
peace at last, dick
Your faith can be sorely tested when the sign
you've been waiting for is not quite all that you
expected. So it was with me when 'Hats' (The
Blue Nile's second album) was released in 1989,
some six years after their first stunningly beauti-
ful creation. The two now sit side by side, never
far from the C D player, the gap next to them
waiting to be filled by Paul Buchanan's next
vision. And here it is, seven years on (and with
only one tour to their credit, where the religious
fervour of the audience was all-encompassing).
But what of this, the latest offering? Best
described as earthy, perhaps. The polish of the
first two albums has been tarnished to a degree
where the accompaniment for the first track,
'Happiness', is a foot tapping on echoing floor-
boards. And it works beautifully, growing into a
rousing gospel praise-be.
Never before have the drums been left so
barren of effects as on 'Love Come Down',
refreshing in their simplicity. Not that everything
on the album works; Holy Love' is the worst
thing they've ever committed to tape, and
thankfully short. Whilst the music is still largely
resplendant, the lyrics are strangely limp. You
can only sing love and yeah yeah yeah so many
times before it becomes passe.
Redemption comes in the form of 'God
Bless You Kid' and the obligatory sparsely-deco-
rated 'Family Life'. These two are the true sav-
iours but I now know from experience that the
rest will reveal themselves in their own good
time.When a Blue Nile disciple hears the strains
of 'Tinsel Town in the Rain' emanatingfromhis
neighbour's house, he is seen to nod sagely -
belief is never more powerful than this. Only the
most hardened agnostic will not be swayed by at
least some part of this album. Go on... light a
candle (8)

I nl. jrti.ilately, this album faUs disappoint-
i
up with sonic pretty good tunes, such as on
ljopcz. sung by James Dean BradfieJd of the
gig: sleeper + longpigs +
octopus™^
It was an Indolent night at Brixton Academy,
with all three bands from the same label. First up
was Octopus, who supported the Auteurs at
their last London gig. They've improved vastly
since then; the trumpets have tightened up and
the lyrics are delivered with passion. The band
play fairly middling songs which tend to become
a little confusing at times, due to so many things
happening at once. It seems as if all the band
members are playing a solo simultaneously.
Having said that, the final track of the set is the
excellent current single 'Your Smile' and the
band leave on a high note.
By the time Longpigs come on, Brixton
academy has turned into a sweat box and the
frenetic moshing encouraged by Crispin and co.
does little to cool the air. Brilliant renditions of
the brilliant tracks on a brilliant album makes the
set, well, brilliant. The whole crowd join in with
that scream from 'She Said' and the band leave
the venue buzzing with excitement.
I have to admit it, I thought Sleeper were
going to be crap live. How wrong can you be?
The stage starts off in pitch darkness and sud-
denly guitarist Jon Stewart is illuminated by two
piercing spotlights, frantically stmrrrming the
first chords from Dress Like Your Mother'. The
drums kick in and then Louise appears - the kids
go utterly bonkers. And this is just the start.
Louise commands all the attention, scam-
pering round the stage like a rabbit on speed, and
mad-man drummer occasionally stands up to
beat the hell out of his kit. All this energy builds
up into 'Inbetweener', the Sleeper anthem. The
crowd descend into total insanity - everyone in
the gig is pogoing up and down, including the
thMysomething couples with their arms around
each other. Most of the rest of the material is
from 'The It Girl' but the old favourite
Delicious' sends all the teenage lads into a fren-
zy, and one even makes it onto the stage.
Sleeper hammer through 'Sale of the
Century', 'Ue Detector', 'Good Luck M r
Gorsky' and several more until the set ends with
the loudest bit of feedback/random drumming I
have ever heard. The encores were
'Shrinkwrapped' and the band's debut single
Alice', a blast from the past if ever I heard one.
That's how wrong I was - top tunes, top
lights, and a top bird - what more can you ask
for?
Manic Street Preachers, and the 'Pacdie'-esque
'Joyrider', but the rest oi it is rather ll&rentO,
Almost every tune vomes oxer If i poar
mixtu people's work, sounding in turn
like Mike< )ldfield, 'ah Wobble, AphexTwin and
to emulating die craft of its 'influences', and just
ends up urt *l and cliche-fcd A hu> let-down (2)
