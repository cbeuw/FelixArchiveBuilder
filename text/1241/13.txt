different teams. Races are close-
ly fought as a whole, but regu-
lars to the series will not easily
forget the sight of Jason Plato
putting Stevie Hodgson on the
grass at over 170 mph or the
repeated and frequent clashes
between Colin White and
Nicolas Minassian. Many of the
other drivers and some of the
team managers have also added
spice to the regular bouts of con-
troversy - particularly in the sea-
son-long needle match between
the circuit racers and the oval
boys.
Everything about ASCAR and
its support package of Legends
and Pick-ups is geared towards
the fans, and the whole atmos-
phere of a race weekend is
friendly and welcoming without
the bustle and impersonality of a
major meeting. In only its first
full season of competition, it is
still a voyage of discovery for the
organisers, technical crew and
the teams, but they appear to
have the balance right, from the
intense and extremely close rac-
ing to the approachability of
team personnel; drivers are
Speedway in Germany.
Rockingham is just outside
Corby so there is absolutely no
excuse in saying its too far away
or hard to get to. The facilities
are top notch and really puts
places like Silverstone and
Brands Hatch to shame. The
Rock is also the only circuit in
the UK where you can watch the
racing from the roof of the pits
garages - well worth a visit for
that alone. Aside from ASCAR,
Rockingham also plays host to
the only European round of the
FedEx CART championship as
well as other top-class national
race meetings.

For the most part, the racing
had been hard but fair and with
just two races left to run, there
are still four drivers capable of
winning the championship and
taking the Mintex Cup away with
them at the end of the year. The
battling quartet of Kelvin Burt,
Colin White, Nicolas Minassian
a
nd Jason Plato are seperated
h a paltry 59 points, and with
1 7
5 available for a win (not
hunting bonuses), anything can
st
-ill happen and most probably
M l - ASCAR is like that.

more than happy to pose for
photos and to sign autographs
while mechanics delight in pro-
viding fans of all ages with used
tyres to take home as souvenirs.
Rockingham Motor Speedway,
known by regular racegoers as
The Rock, is the spiritual home
of ASCAR - built on the site of a
former steelworks, it is the UK's
newest circuit and only purpose-
built oval. All but four of the
Mintex Cup races are contested
here, with the remainder being
run at the Lausitz Euro
both days. If you do decide to go
along and see for yourself, you
can be sure that the good 'ol
boys of ASCAR will put on a
show that won't disappoint. Get
real - who needs Formula One
when you can have racing that's
this good?

There is still time to sample
the ASCAR experience this year,
with the final two races that will
decide the championship taking
place on the weekend of the 5th
and 6th of October. For those
interested in going to
Rockingham, a car pass for the
practice and qualifying on the
Saturday costs £5 and a ticket
for Sunday's races is £15.
Access to the paddock is free on
Jonathan Clark for their time
and co-operation in producing
this feature. Additional special
mentions must go to Kelvin Burt
for giving up some of his time in
order to give me a good insight
on ASCAR from a driver's per-
spective and to the RML and
Bintcliffe Sport crews for their
news, views and comments
throughout the season.
