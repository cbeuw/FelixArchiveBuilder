Hi De Ho, campers. I am here so
we can usher in the new term
together, as old friends, and hope-
fully as new.
I hope you are all fully rested
after your lovely summer holidays.
You should rest happy in the
knowledge that I am now signifi-
cantly more tired than when the
holidays started out, and not in a
good way, let me tell you.
For those of you who don't
know, I'm Will, and I edit this here
newspaper. Although officially still
a student, I graduated in July
2001, and since then I have been
working on this. Not this issue,
obviously, but Felix itself.
You should also, perhaps, be
warned that I am prone to reveal-
ing fairly personal issues in this
column, so if you are easily
offended, then look away now.
Until the end of the year.
But all this aside, I can write, as
you can tell from my excellent use
of a conjunction at the beginning
of a paragraph, reasonably well,
as well I should, given the amount
of practice I've had over the year.
However, I do not like it, because
I believe that Felix should be writ-
ten by you lot, since it's you that
read it. Therefore I'm asking any-
one who's interested to come
along and see us at Freshers Fair,
or just come down to the office in
the West Wing basements of Beit
Quad, and you can help out com-
pletely at will. And this is because
we're special here. There are no
members to this club. Every other
club you have to join, and give
money to, but not this one. 'Write
when you like, edit when you like,
come and go as you like, and
spend a fair amount of time in the
bar if you like (researching stories,
obviously)'. That was our motto,
by the way. It's more catchy in
Latin, no really - 'In vino Veritas'.
So yeah, it's nice to see you all
back here already. It seems like
only yesterday that all my friends
left, leaving me here languishing
in my basement, but you'll all be
pleased to know that I have fully
succeeded in having several men-
tal breakdowns over the year, but
I still manage to avoid becoming
addicted to psychotropic drugs.
Sorry - this is a reference to some-
thing I wrote at the beginning of
last year (and I can assure you I
am the only person that remem-
bers), where I considered past edi-
tors and their mental healths hav-
ing completed this job for a year. I
am pleased to say that I am the
most sane one, in my opinion.
Which obviously goes to show
how little work I must do.
So, to bring some of you up to
scratch. The cat's name is
Bridget, and while the more astute
of you may recognise her from last
year, you have to agree she's had
a bit of a make-over. In case
you're interested 'Felix' is her mid-
dle name. Yes, boys and girls, this
is the whole new-look Felix that's
had the Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen
treatment and everything. And I
must say she looks fantastic
(thanks Al). So yes. Only a few
more hours until my deadline is
really, truly upon me, and in that
time all I have to do is write a few
news stories. But why am I writing
them, when you could do a so
much better job? I don't know...
maybe you're too lazy or busy dur-
ing Freshers Week.
All those of you who are fans of
my more interesting tales of woe
and broken dreams may be sad to
hear that at the moment I'm feel-
ing relatively stable, but there are
a few surprises in store for me
next year, I'm sure, so do not fear:
mental trauma will not be long in
coming. And for the rest of you
who like a bit of political com-
mentary in your editorials, then let
me just say that the current eco-
nomic climate does not lend itself
to the usual form of self-satisfied
self-grandiosement to which you
may well be accustomed.
And on that note, my good
friends, Adios. Or should that be
Au revoir? I don't know.
