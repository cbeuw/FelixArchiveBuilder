Salomon Smith Barney & Citibank
This year, he traded £200 Million worth
of them.
During a course in investments, something "clicked"-Jeff knew he wanted to
become a derivatives trader. A year later, he was helping to conduct some of
the biggest trades in the world. Jeff believes this could have only happened
at Citigroup. With a revolutionary business model that is quickly changing the
industry, Citigroup recruits ambitious, highly talented people and allows them
to find their own path to their potential. To find out more, come to one of our
on-campus presentations or have a look online. Who knows? It could be one
of the best investments you'll ever make. Citigroup.com
