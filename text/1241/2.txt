Beit Quad Improved?
Beit Quadrangle, the grounds out-
side the Union building, were refur-
bished over the holidays, mainly to
remove the unsafe surfaces and
improve wheelchair access.
The new design leaves the Quad
entirely without steps, though
much of the original paving was
retained and reused. The Quad
now has paths around the outside
and a single central path from the
Quad archway through to the main
Union entrance. As reported previ-
ously in Felix, the aim was for a
more Cambridge-like quadrangle
feel, but we might have been tak-
ing the piss.
There has been some concern
among Union drinkers using the
tables outside about the 'bonded
gravel' which has been used to
cover those areas which aren't on
the main path, but which are also
unsuitable for turfing due to heavy
traffic. The gravel is rapidly
'unbonding', creating more of a
sandpit effect and problems for
those charged with sweeping the
quad of cigarette butts.
Apart from that, it is hoped the
new layout will satisfy the Health
and Safety Executive who argued
that the previous paving was a trip
hazard in event of a fire, which
might lead to a nighttime stampede
of drunk students if it occurred dur-
ing a large Union event. Despite
Union interests, however, the proj-
ect received only a small amount of
funding from the Union for some
additional facilities, the remainder
coming from College.
The greatest challenge yet for the
new quad will be Freshers Week,
which will no doubt see many
attempts to destroy it. AW
