Greetings everyone! A quick word from me, Wailer Ned, to intro-
duce this week's crossword, shamelessly stolen from Turnip Henry.
In case you're new to these parts, you'll get a crossword each week
written by someone with an increasingly stupid name. Usually
we'll give prizes, but this is a repeat and we don't trust you not to
look in your secret Felix archive.
If any of you would like a stupid name, or even better, would like
to write crosswords, then e-mail us at felix@ic.ac.uk. With lots of
love from your ever-camp crossworders, Wailer Ned
