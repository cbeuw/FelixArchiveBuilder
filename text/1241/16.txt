Gliding
As we neared two thousand feet,
I pulled the release, turned hard
left and waved good bye to the
tow 'plane. As he dived away to
my right I headed for the cloud
dead ahead - a white, fluffy, well-
developed cumulus cloud, it
looked like it could be marking a
strong thermal. As I passed under
the sunlight side of the cloud, I
felt the right wing of the glider
being forced upwards. I pulled up
and turned hard right to stay in
the lift. Glancing at the instru-
ments, and adjusting the radius
of my turn, I soon found myself in
the core of the thermal. The
altimeter needle began to wind
round the dial... 2000'...2100'...
2300'. Five minutes later, at
4000', the climb eventually
petered out. I was now flying level
with the cloud base, staring
straight down at the airfield I
launched from; now a tiny green
strip between the trees.
Well, the weather wasn't quite
that good every day, but many
members of Imperial College
Gliding Club (icGC) had similar
experiences during our recent
four-week summer expedition to
the Black Forest, Germany. Last
year's expedition took us to the
Spanish Pyrenees, while an expe-
dition to the Czech Republic is on
the cards for 2003. icGC is the
longest established and best
equipped gliding club in the UK,
with a fleet of gliders consisting of
a two-seat training glider and two
high performance single seater
gliders. Union subsidy means that
icGC is without a doubt the
cheapest and most accessible
opportunity to learn to fly avail-
able. And if you're not sure if it's
for you, why not take a no obliga-
tion trial flight for just £25.
Finally, several of the pilots
who participated in this year's
expedition took up gliding only
last autumn, so if you start train-
ing now, you could be joining us
next summer...
