M y philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:
1. Reality exists as an objective absolute — facts are facts, independent
of man's feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.
2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material
provided by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality,
his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic
means of survival.
3. Man — every man — is an end in himself, not the means to the ends
of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to
others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational
self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of
his life.
4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a
system where men deal with one another, not as victims and
executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free,
voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may
obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no
man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The
government acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights; it uses
physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its
use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full
capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a
complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for
the same reasons as the separation of state and church.
