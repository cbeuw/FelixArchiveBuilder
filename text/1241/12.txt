Time To Kick A S C A R
If you're sick and tired of watch-
ing Formula One, you could well
be forgiven for thinking that top
line motor racing is interminably
boring. That observation is
amazingly far from the truth
however, because on an indus-
trial estate in Northamptonshire,
you can see racing of a sort that
will really make your hair stand
on end. Imagine going to a cir-
cuit where you see cars dicing
three wide at 170 miles an hour,
where the action is relentless
and where mistakes are met by
a painful and expensive
encounter with a concrete wall.
Think of a place where bigger is
most definitely better and where
the noise is almost guaranteed
to make your ears bleed.
plenty of manic action from the
moment the first wheel turns in
anger. Each race is over a fixed
distance of 100 miles, with a
single qualifying session setting
the grid for the first race of the
weekend. The finishing order of
the first race determines the grid
for the second race and so on. At
the start, the field is held behind
the pace car until the track goes
green, and when it does, it
unleashes a 60-lap frenzy of
panel-bashing, paint-swapping,
wall-scraping, high-speed draft-
ing and that genuine rarity in
Formula One - overtaking.
Mandatory pit stops to take on
two fresh tyres add to the spec-
tacle and with only three
mechanics allowed over the wall

Ladies and gentlemen, wel-
come to ASCAR.
Anglo-American Stock Car
Racing (or ASCAR for short) is a
no-holds-barred, high-octane
oval racing series loosely based
on NASCAR Winston Cup.
According to the specialist
press, it is a championship that
is going places fast, and one
that is rapidly increasing in pop-
ularity among fans and drivers
alike. It is not just a question of
flooring the throttle pedal and
turning left - there is far more to
it than that, and as drivers are
willing to testify, ASCAR is more
of a way of life, one that is fast
becoming very, very addictive.
The ASCAR format guarantees
into the hot pit lane, it always
guarantees a certain level of
mayhem. Plenty can go wrong
during an ASCAR race and
invariably does; this is racing
where staying out of trouble is
an art form and where the
opportunist is king.
Underneath the eye-wateringly
garish paint jobs, the 500 bhp
V8-powered cars are essentially
identical (if somewhat agricul-
tural in the technology depart-
ment), so succeeding in ASCAR
depends purely on talent, balls
and an astute racing brain.
Driving a car at average lap
speeds of 155 miles an hour just
inches away from a concrete
wall is a real test of skill at the
best of times, but doing that in
the close company of other cars
requires nerves of steel along
with a peculiar brand of insanity.
It takes a special kind of person
to compete here - this is the
stomping ground of hard,
uncompromis-
ing racers and
that is why only
the best will ever win
at this particular game. ,—v—^— t ,^ N
