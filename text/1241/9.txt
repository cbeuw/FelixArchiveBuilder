FELIX
stoic is Student Television Of
Imperial College. And we do
exactly what we say on the tin. In
that we make television, in a stu-
dent-y way. In the way that the
major props on our light ents show
last year were pints of beer, and
one of the presenters was made of
cardboard... but we also make
serious news programmes twice
weekly, as well as documentaries
and live coverage of important
events around college. We've
been known to make music videos
for student bands in the past and
will respond to any ideas from
clubs and societies who want their
event filmed.
We start this year with an
almost-new station to be found in
the west basements of Beit Quad,
making us the best-equipped stu-
dent television station in the coun-
try, and you'll often find someone
down there making use of the
facilities - whether filming a show,
planning production with other
people, or broadcasting. In fact,
all aspects of making a television
programme are covered- from
STOIC
scripting to shooting, reporting to
editing.
And you can get as involved as
you want- turn up occasionally to
operate a camera or sound mix, or
take on your own show on any
subject you want. You'll always
find someone willing to help you
with it.
If you think that this all sounds
intriguing (or even if you don't),
come and find us in Beit Quad at
the Freshers Fair on Tuesday 1st
October and talk to our members
or come to one of our workshops
on Sunday 6th October at 2pm or
4pm, where you'll have the
chance to get some hands-on
experience at making a show.
Anyone is welcome to join - we're
always looking for new ideas and
presenters. When else are you
going to get the chance to run a
television station, blag your way
into gigs for free, or get horribly
drunk with a potential audience of
10,000 people?
Even if you don't want to join,
we broadcast to the JCR and dBs
some lunchtimes, so you can
always watch and see what we've
decided to release to the general
public. Typically, we'll screen the
most recent of the news pro-
grammes, a few music videos,
some light entertainment and
other more specialist shows.
To see the type of show we're
currently making, visit our web-
site, www.stoictv.com and have a
look around. There you should
find a recent edition of our news
programme, as well as a docu-
mentary to download.
This documentary is a guide to
the Union, filmed in the weeks
before term started, for anyone
who's ever been interested in how
the Union works, and exactly what
these sabbatical people we vote
for every year do. Included is a
guide to the Union building itself,
as well as interviews with every
sabbatical.
To get in contact with stoic for
any reason at all, just email man-
ager@stoictv.com, call 48104
from any college phone, or just
come down to see us in the Media
Centre in Beit Quad.
IC RADIO
Hello, and welcome to the first IC
Radio column of the new year. IC
Radio is the student radio station
here at Imperial, broadcasting 24
hours a day, 7 days a week dur-
ing term time.
Our programmes
So, what sort of music do you
like? Indie, rock, alternative,
R&B, rap, hip-hop, reggae, soul,
dance, trance, house, drum and
bass, garage, cheese, pop...
We"ve got shows playing all
those styles and more, and if we
don't have a show that caters for
your taste, then come along and
make one. We also have some
speech-based shows and regular
news bulletins.
Make sure you tune in to our
special programmes throughout
the whole of Freshers' Week,
including a live broadcast from
Freshers' Fair. We'll be giving
away a crateload of CDs, and
fou r one-year supplies of McCoy's
crisps.
Get involved
We have opportunities in all
areas of radio, from presenting to
publicity to production, and no
experience is necessary. Our new
studios would put many a com-
mercial station to shame, and our
professional level production
facilities are used by bands from
both inside and outside College.
You really can have your very
own radio programme within a
few weeks, heard around campus
on AM and worldwide via the
internet. You could join our music
team and review the latest
releases before they hit the
shops. How about being a
reporter or presenter for our
College news service? To find out
more, come and see us at
Freshers' Fair, visit our studios in
the west wing of Beit Quad, or
