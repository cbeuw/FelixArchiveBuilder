UGM Report
A UGM was held on the 5th December at 6.00p.m. in the
lower Union refectory^" The first attempt at this new time and
place was thought to be a success.
The latest 'softening up'
technique used on the some-
times ill-behaved floor
(remember all the paper dart
throwing in the Great Hall) was
the showing of three cartoon
films prior to the meeting albeit
one black and white. The
President seemed pleased
with the result as he kept
muttering loudly 'Good, they
are behaving themselves' or
words to that effect, for the
first part of the meeting.
The sorting out of red tape
(minutes, matters arising,
questions, President's report
etc.) was done with amazing
speed; the only thing of note
being the ratification of the
last set of elections — two
publications board members
and a couple of departmental
reps. W
e now came to the
substantive part of the meeting:
the motions on policy. The
first opposing the proposal that
'sixth form students should
pay £2 upon entering the VCCA
scheme' was carried after some
discussion. The second motion
was passed, declaring ICU's
opposition to recent cuts in
education and their effects
upon students and the quaifcy
of education, this followed an
amendment by Mr. John Lane
which read: 'Since the cuts
will mean a worsening of both
the conditions of those working
in College and the quality of
education of students, they
must be fought in a united way
by all the unions in IC. ICU
should as soon as possible,
call a meeting of the JCU
(consisting of ICU, ASTMS,
NUPE. AUT) with additional
representatives from NALGO
and ICPGG'.
This amendment was put in
place of the original section 4
and was accepted by the
proposer Tom Abraham. The
motion was passed with minor
deletions.
iThe real bone of con-
tention in the meeting was, of
course, the third motion on
terrorism proposed by Mr. Kill,
'This motion noted and believed
in the need for Mr. Jenkin's
BUT. The President (having
passed the chair to Pete
Teague) proposed a 'delete
all. insert all' ammendment
declaring ICU's support of the
NUS motion and opposing the
aforesaid legislation. The
President's ammendment was
defeated.
In all eleven amendments
(which took up one and a half
hours to discuss), in total were
proposed, which- varied in
importance. Several of these
amendments were only passed

after a show of hands.
One of these amendments
was, 'ICU instructs the
Honorary Secretary to write to
the National Council of Civil
Liberties and the national
press expressing their disgust
at the NCCL's statement
condemning the BUT. At this
the President intervened to say
that he felt that this amend-
ment would be undermining his
position and that it was his
duty to represent the views of
IC students regardless of his
own opinions. He proposed an
amendment to this amended
motion which had the words
'Honorary Secretary' replaced
by the 'President'. The amend-
ment in this form was over-
whelmingly carried.
A 'move to the vote' cry on
this motion (motion 3 —

terrorism) was immediately
followed by a challenge to the
quorum at 8.46p.m. which was
upheld by Pete Teague who
was in the Chair. The meeting
then closed with thanks, from
Pete Teague to the members
of the floor. A meeting of
Imperial College Students was
not held as usual due to the
fact that everyone left
immediately the UGM ended.
