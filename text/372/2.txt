ONCE AGAIN the perennial problem
has arisen: Certain members of the IC
Union Council find themselves at odds
with the Editor. Exactly why, is, as
usual, uncertain. Cannot those people
who have so much to say about FELIX
come to me and simply say it?
'The Editor's not doing his job'.
What job? Tell me, what job? My terms
of reference have never been laid down—
I have to rely on Council and the rest of
the Union for guidance. What guidance?
Tell me, what guidance? Few Union
officers have ever bothered to make
constructive criticisms. I have been
left to my own devices and ideas. If you
think they are wrong, tell me. If you
think they can be improved, tell me.
If you can think of better ones, tell me.
If I am not informed about people's
feelings, if I am to be totally ignored
and the third sabbatical kicked around
like a football, then what else CAN I do?
I sincerely hope that I will now get
some sort of response.
Drastic steps had to be taken size-
wise in order to make this, the last
issue of the term, a viable proposition.
Six pages were felt to be the absolute
maximum if we were going to be able to
be able to get FELIX out at all by
Thursday. (Distributing it on Friday
was felt to be of no use whatsoever).
Apologies are in order to Tom
Abraham, the Postgraduate Affairs
Officer, on two accounts. Firstly, his
PiG Affairs Corner was pasted-up
incorrectly leading to discontinuities in
the text. Secondly, through sheer
physical production difficulties we have
had to postpone the feature on whether
the PGAO should be on the Exec or not
yet again. Suffice it is to say that the
feature could well appear as a centre-
feature next term which in any case
will be closer to the time when the
actual constitutional issue will be
debated.
Quote heard at last Monday's
Council meeting from a highly-respected
member, when the meeting seemed a
little confused over an amendment to
standing orders: 'Council seems in
danger of disappearing up its own
orifice'.
Thanks!

Dear Sir,
Please may I take up space
in your magazine to record a
big 'Thank You' to the Students
Union on behalf of the Over
60's Club at Fulham. Their
kind donation will be put to
good use, for their Christmas
Dinner outing to Sunbury Court.
Once again many thanks and
God Bless You All.

IF Only...
Imperial College Union,
10th December, 1974.
Dear Sir,
We ask how can such
diatribe be allowed to be
published in FELIX, the
Imperial College Newspaper,
as last issue's IF Only..?
Indeed, Ms Fletcher talks
about the advantages of
following a bi-lingual course;
however, it would seem
apparent to us that she has
in fact lost the ability to use
simple English, In addition,
she would seem to be following
a hypocritical attitude since
on the one hand she asks
students '..to take a res-
ponsible attitude towards
helping to finance themselves..'
and immediately proceeds to
make it clear that she herself
would resent having to sub-
sidise anyone else.
She reminds us of our
responsibilities to our country
and in the same breath goes on
to say that she is looking for a
wider choice of countries to
emigrate to!
She then goes on to bitch
about '..wonderful intricacies
of IC..'; '..women excluded
from the bar..' (what nonsense,
the IF President uses it!) and
'..THAT ragmagV which helps
those in need — no thanks to
Ap Soc members like Ms
Fletcher.
As regards her remark 'In
true school tradition, I was
volunteered..', we suggest that
in future she extends her
general apathetic attitude to
include the writing of articles
for FELIX. It will be a
blessing for all concerned.
Yours faithfully,
Paul Ekpenyong,
Riz Shakir.
