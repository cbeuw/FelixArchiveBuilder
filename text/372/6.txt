IC women's enthusiasm in
forming a 'Women's Boat Club'
since Morphy day last year.
They rowed for the Flowers
Cup (surprisingly enough
awarded by Lady Flowers).
The first race was the
Lowry race, rowed from the
Mile Post to the University
Stone (1 mile). Guilds' steadily
gained water at the beginning
of the race RCS were about
!6 length down until someone
caught a crab and they were
5 lenghts down. Guilds' kept
this lead, and took it easy
(Simon Baker stroking well
below 30) through the finish.
Mines followed 2 lenghis
behind RCS.
The official umpire managed
to arrive in time for the next
race, the women's restricted
fours. This race was more
interesting as the crews were
much more evenly matched.
After a somewhat controversial
start Mines were in the lead.
ROS had about " 2 length on
Guilds but before half way
(iuilds overtook them, but then
failed to take advantage of the
stream. Mines won by a con-
vincing 3 lengths and although
they had a slight advantage at
the start they rowed well
(especially since two of them
hardly rowed before).
As soon as the Lowry
Crews left their boats, the
Rugby 8's took their place.
They had virtually no ex-
perience (the cox was supposed
to have some for safety's sake)
the crew zigzagged their way
slowly past the fight, up to
Fulham Football Stadium. One
guy smashed his finger on the
side of the boat and the crew
stopped at the bank to let a
stinking polythene sack row in
his place. The race was short
(1200m) but dramatic. Guilds
started way out of the stream
but their cox played well and
aimed straight for the other
crews. By half wah coxes were
screaming obscenities through
the flying spray and sweat.
Tension was mounting as- the
crews drew closer and closer
together, the blades were
missing by millimeters,
Charlie (the boatmen) was
cringing. But Guilds' Cheni.
l.ng. Rent-a-C'rew were in-
creasing their half length lead
all the time. Past the boathouse
Guilds glided at Charlie
Wrigley's Sunday Afternoon
rating while lesser mortals
splashed behind. But then the
other crews made a comeback,
at every stroke Guilds were
losing water. Paul (whatever
you do, don't panic) OTIara
was panicking, Charlie (can't
get the f'ing thing out) Wingley
had most definitely lost his
cool. But with 10 gigantic-
strokes Rent-a-Crew nearly
capsized the boat and won the
race by over a length. Mines
and RCS lost (well, you ought
to write your own article).
The Morphy Race (1st 8's)
followed later. Although
Guild's had to substitute one
of their Lub.Lab.internationals
(Tim Crookes) at the last
minute, it was still expected
they would win.
At the start of the race
Guilds were in fact, slightly
down on RCS. But when (iuilds
passed Mines (who had the
stream), Pete Hughes steered
them (successfully cutting up
Mines) into the fast water.
With this advantage Guilds
took 3 or 4 lengths. No Sweat.
Past the boathouse it looked
as though Mines * RCS were
neck and neck but it was an
illusion since RCS came in
second with a length of clear
water over Mines. (Never mind
Mines, at least you didn't have
to stop and row backwards this
year).
The man at the finishing
post was Haydn Thomas
(Guilds) so don't blame me.

After the grounding of the
new style IC team the previous
Saturday the same side was
given the chance to shine in
the first round of the (iutteridge
Cup. Despite the visit of the
London fire brigade to Har-
lington the game took place on
a pitch which was in suprisingly
good condition.
For the first time this season
IC were unfortunate enough to
lose the toss but this did not
stop IC from playing in the
opposite direction to normal.
The match started on a
fairly even basis with QF.C
tackling the IC players with
great spirit. Nearh . all the
early pressure was from IC,
however, butwewere rewardei
only by a (-rank Forbes penalty
after about twenty minutes. The
much bigger IC players were
bound to come out on top
eventually and soon after this
penalty the muscle did, in fact
pay off. For the first time this
season the tea and biscuits
brigade supplied some quick
loose possession and the backs
were not slow to capitalise.
'The Prisoner", at outside,
half supplied quick ball to the
centres and the Frog entered
the line with excellent timing,
the result of these manoeuvres
being the creation of a great
number of overlaps.
A few strange faces turned
up in the lower lounge last
Saturday which meant that
2 late comers for the A's and 2
for the extra's did not get
games. The Hxtra Ist's went to
Harlington for a return match
with Belsize Park, who beat
us earlier this season (I'm
sure it has nothing to do with
the fact that I wasn't playing).
The game started at a fast
pace which never lowered and
itis some surprise that D.Turner
kept going. The Hxtra's scored'
early on by a try from G.Pat-
terson which M.Spencer
converted and then Spencer
dropped a goal to give u's a
9-0 lead arid the possibility in
our minds that we were going
to walk away with the game.
However, after A.Clapham (he
put footwear on for the game)
laid out one of the opposition
things started to swing away
from us and Belsize scored
(£-4). After an interception by
C. (I haven't scored this
season) Whiteley, T.Fearn
scored to> give us a 13-4 lead
which Beisize took from us and
left the half-time score as
A succession of tries were
run in the last twenty minutes
with the wings Zappa Williams
and Bo Bo Furter both running
well, the fonner scoring the
odd try. Mitch Hinstien also
scored a good try after a peel
which was superbly taken by
frank Pants. The hall time
score was 23-0.
The second half saw the
consolidation of the I
C dom-
inance and several more tries
were scored. The line
continued to move well bu; the
odd tea cup was seen 10 be
secreted in some of the
forwards belly buttons. Tries
were scored by Bo Bo Hurler,
Mitch Hinstien and Frank
Pants (2) and 'The Prisoner'
converted some.
An all round good per-
formance was given by the
players and spectators both
during and after the match.
After our visit to F.arls Court
flights to Australia were
booked up for the next six
months. The star of the show
must have been 'Mad' Mitch
Hinstien.
Team: F .Rog, Z.Williams,
F.Gilbert, F.Stern, B.Furter.

F.Austin, F. fapi'i r. f .Booth,

F .Smith.
(13-18).
Playing against the con-
ditions the Hxtra's made the
better of the halves and
T.Fearn put us within sight of
victory again with a 50yd run
to make the score (17-18). At
this the extra's pulled out the
slops and the game livened up.
After some excellent backing
up play by the whole side,
S.Churdy went over to put IC
in the lead, M.Spencer con-
verting to make it 23-18. The
last 10 minutes were tense
with Belsize trying to retake
the game and the extra's trying
to make sure of the game.
Finally J.Rose, working a
scissors with M.Spencer, went
over with half the team at his
shoulders to clinch the game
with a final score of 27-18.
Team: D.Turner. Ned, J.Rose,
G.Patterson, C.Whiteley,
M.Spencer, T.Fearn, M.Hughes,
S.Hoyle. C.Wrigley, P.Jeffs.
A.Clapham, J.Marklow, R.Doyle

Thanks for finishing off the
term so well. See you all next
term.
