TWO FIRES AT THE WEEKEND-—
PYROMANIACS AT IC?
Burning Controversy - SWEET perform with 'flair'!
•u ^ F I R h S l><
-curred in College Block over last weekend.
Ihe first on Friday evening when persons unknown started the
alarm, and smoke was found pouring from a locked storeroom.
Smoke filled a corridor
where RCS were holding a
party. The fire alarm was rung
intermittently and not con-
tinuously as it should be after
6p.m. on weekends. This could
have put the 1300 people in
College Block at risk, lour
fire engines and a turntable
ladder came up Imperial
Institute road at 12-15 with
sirens going.
Rector Disturbed
This disturbed
who was . seen
the Rector
wandering around in a yellow
paisley dressing gown and,
it is alleged, no pyjamas.
Fire Brigade Error
The fire officers were
narrowly prevented from
breaking into Bio-Chem even
though they had been told the
fire was in College Block.
When they eventually got to
the room, the fire was already
on the wane' 'and only an
extinguisher was required to
finish it off. The cause of the
fire was two old typewriters
and their covers burning. The
fire may have been caused by
a cigarette end or possibly
deliberately.
Against Regulations
The second tire occurred
on stage during the Sweet
Concert on Saturda> night.
While using some magnesium
flares as part of their act some
other material round the drum
kit caught fire. Though damage
was superficial, the use of
these flares was against fire
regulations, and no one from
Ents had consulted the- college
Fire Officer beforehand.
Fire Officer
The college Fire Officer is
Bob Foggon, who is to be
found in the Security Office in
College Block. He is concerned
that many clubs and societies
do not use his services. He is
there to be consulted before
any party, show, etc. on any
possible fire risk. He would
also be happy to advise
individual students on fire
prevention and precautions
where they live at college.
WOULD LIKE TO WISH ALL ITS READERS
A
VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS
