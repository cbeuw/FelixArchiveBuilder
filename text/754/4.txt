Reply
Dear Sir,
I suggest John Martin goes and
puts his head in a very large bucket
of ice-cold water. How can a well-
produced, balanced paper such as
FELIX agree to carry half a page of
moronic drivel from someone
whose literary appreciation would
not appear to extend further than
the Sun.
I fail to understand what is
grossly arrogant in distributing
leaflets at the Careers Fair,
encouraging people to think of the
implications of a career, say, in the
arms industry. Students were free to
take them or reject them as they
wished. Surely to allow companies
to distribute propaganda material
unchallenged would have been a
gross violation of the student right
to freedom of thought. British
Nuclear Fuels, for example, issued a
brochure showing someone holding
pieces of fuel material in their bare
hands. ICI produced a brochure
telling us how much they cared
about the environment. Isn't it
about time that Scientists and
Engineers at Imperial thought a
little about the morality, say, of
working in South Africa or in
designing weapons? I fail to see what
is cowardly in not wanting to be
responsible for a weapon designed
to kill a family half way across the
world, simply because they
happened to be brought up under an
idealogy not as perfect as our own.
I can now reveal that, surprise
surprise, John Martin has a
Barclays Bank account. Could this
perhaps have affected his
judgement? The simple truth is that
Barclays quite openly funds the
racist regime in South Africa and
actively participates in the
exploitation of Namibia against the
U N charter. No amount of
conscience money to token blacks
or statements by Barclays on the evil
of apartheid can change the fact that
Barclays has blood on its hands.
Wake up John! There is a war going
on in South Africa which will have a
fundamental effect on the whole
world. Stop being so bloody naive!
Yoursfaithfully,
Andy Welter

House That
Jack Built
Dear Editor,
I would like to explain why
College decided to get rid of the
Student Residence Committee's
gold block.
As it happens this is a proposal I
put to SRC. The reason for this was
that, for at least the last four years
SRC has been sitting on just over a
quarter of a million pounds in the
aim of using it as a deposit for a new
hall. This amount of money is
completely inadequate, on top of
which all the interest from it goes to
college due to college policy, and the
residence committee doesn't see a
penny.
At the same time the SRC is
paying 7% interest to college on
money borrowed to buy residences
in the past. Hence by using a large
percentage of the gold block to pay
part of this off, the SRC and hence
the students will be earning 7% on
the money in real terms.
It was agreed that this 7% should
be put aside to build up the gold
block, and not squandered. At the
same time it was said that College
would take the fact that we gave
them this money into account if a
new hall was to be built or bought,
as ultimately SRC will have to
borrow the money for this from
college. Hence the student wins in
every way.
Yours

Platform
Tickets
Dear David
What is "Freedom of Speech?"
We have read a lot in FELIX in
recent weeks about it, but do we
have an absolute right of "Freedom
of Speech"? In this civilised society,
of course, we don't. The riot acts,
the libel laws and the race relation
laws restrict what we can say in
public and rightly so. Society has
decided that, in the interests of
society as a whole , certain views
should not be expressed in public.
A 'no-platform' policy that
certain student unions have
adopted, by democratic vote, is
taking the idea slighly further. They
have decided that the expression of
certain views, be they racist, sexist,
homophobic or whatever, has the
effect of restricting freedom, by
intimidating already disadvantaged
and intimidated groups into silence.
They have made the decision that
views of ethnic minorities, gays and
women, for example, are worth
having more than racists, sexists etc.
There is little doubt that the
expression of such extreme views
can intimidate people, many of
whom are feeling scared or worried
about speaking anyway and result in
the supression of views. Hence a no-
platform policy, instead of
restricting free speech, can be used
to extend it.
Of course you have to be very
careful about the definition of the
terms 'racist', or 'sexist', etc. For
example the NUS 'no-platform'
policy only stops the like of the
National Front, the British National
Party, from having a platform. The
NUS are well aware of the dangers
of extending the definitions more
widely, which would result in the
policy having no credibility at all
It is not just a question of freedom
of speech, but a question of whose
speech; the oppressed or the
oppressors.
Yours

Of
Loans
And
Letters
Dear Sir,
In reply to Colin Trotman's letter
in last weeks FELIX, I would like to
make the following points regarding
the Government's proposal for the
introduction of student loans.
He says the loan would be paid
off at low interest rates as the
graduate's career develops;but why
should students be penalised for
entering college by having to pay for
it themselves.
The idea of loans wrongly
assumes that a student is going to
automatically walk into a well paid
job after graduating and pay off the
loan, along with the pressures of a
mortgage and other financial
commitment.
The prospect of having to pay off
a massive loan may persuade many
students, especially for 4 or 5 year
courses, against going to University
or Poly. The Government would
then think it was justified to close
down more departments and
universities.
Mr. Trotman says that a loan
system would "increase pressure on
universities to develop the right
courses for industry and
commerce." Does this mean that
subjects without excellent
employment prospects will be
irrelevant and unnecessary?
He admits that the student grant
has been reduced to an intolerably
low level, but feebly tries to blame
this on the N.U.S.
Clearly the Government is trying
to price education out of the reach
of ordinary people. Education is far
too important for the Government
to neglect its responsibilities or try
to make it into another 'self-
financing' subject as has happened
with many of our social services and
industry.
Yours faithfully,

Wistful
Thoughts
Dear Dave
I would like to reply to Jonathan
Turner's letter in Felix 753. Men at
this College (students and staff) are
amazingly sexist. Many of them do
not realise the problems faced by
women at this College. For
example, some women at this
College take a long time to find close
female friends. This is because the
year group/laboratory they work
with has so few females. People need
close friends of the same sex to
confide in.
This does not mean that I support
organisations that restrict their
membership to one sex.
Organisations like Links, 22 and
Chaps implicitly support the theory
that women can't really be
successful at I.C. They can't join
organisations for the most sociable
people in College; the people who
have really run the Union.
It is important though that an
organisation exists to consider
women's issues and bring together
women so that they can make
friends. WIST is that organisation.
Men can and do join WIST if they
want. They should, though, support
the aims of WIST.
I find it incredible that some men
at this College still do not recognise
the need for a women's
organisation, but I regard it as an
example of the sexism of this
College. Men at this College can be
amazingly hypocritical. Staff at IC
are actively encouraging women to
study here while remaining active
members of tie clubs, the Masons,
etc. I hope that this College will
eventually see sense and ban these
organisations.
