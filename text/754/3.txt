Controversial Act
The new Education Act, which
includes a controversial section
designed to protect "Freedom of
speech" in universities, received
Royal approval last week.
Section 43 of the Act "lays a
general duty" on those governing an
institution of higher education to
secure freedom of speech for both
members (students and staff) and
visiting speakers. It requires each
intstitution to draw up a code
practice regulating the arrangement
of meetings and other activities, as
well as conduct at such meetings.

Education March
Students in London, dressed in
black and carrying coffins, marched
to the Department of Education &
Science on Wednesday. The march
was part of a series of protests also
carried out in Southhampton,
Portsmouth, Leicester and
Manchester in support of people
who are, according to the NUS
being locked out of education by
government education policies.
The march was followed by
lobbies, conferences and debates,
some with prospective parlia-
mentary candidates.
Media Weekend
Representatives from the country's
student newspapers attended the
National Union of Students media
conference last weekend. During the
conference delegates participated in
seminars on investigative
journalism, news-writing and layout
design. The NUS and Guardian
award for the best student
newspaper was presented to
Sheffield university's "Darts".
FELIX Editor David Jones said
that he would like to have attended
the conference, but as usual had not
heard about it until a few days
before. He added that it was a shame
that IC Union was not affiliated to
the NUS as FELIX would walk all
over any other student newspaper in
the competition.
Services Week
Imperial College Union will be
holding a "services week" from lst
to 5th December. This coincides
with the 75th anniversary of the
Union. A series of special events will
be held in the bookshop, bar and
snackbar.
Bar promotions, waiter service at
Norman's and two parties have been
planned. One of the parties will
include performances by Sandy
Shaw and Zeke Masijika (formerly
of Orange Juice).
IC Union is also holding
discussions with the university of
London Union (ULU) on the
possibility of holding the next
General Union Council at Imperial.
Fresh System
A new air-freshening system is to be
installed in the Gents toilets in the
Union Building next week.
The Union will hire four
"squirtymatic" appliances at a cost
of £28 a month in an effort to
improve "the disgusting state of the
bogs".
The appliances d e l i v e r
disinfectant to the urinals and spray
rose-scented air freshener every
twenty minutes. Commenting on
this new development, FELIX toilet
correspondent Jane Spiegel said,
"IC will be the sweetest smelling
student body in London."
RCSU Rag Mag
It was decided on Tuesday that
the RCSU will produce a Rag Mag
this year. Sales of the Mag are
expected to raise £3,500 in total, but
production costs of £1,500 must be
recovered within 30 days. RCSU
plan to have two Rag tours within
this time limit in order to raise the
money. The Mag will be edited by
seven people from the three CCUS
or other interested parties.
Southside Flood
A serious escape of water occured in
Southside yesterday morning at
6am. The staircase from the ground
floor entrance foyer to Selkirk Hall
was quickly awash. An eye-witness
later told FELIX that the flow had
been 'substantial'.
The College engineers were
alerted by Security and rapidly
stemmed the flood by isolating the
leaking pipe joint.
The extent of the damage is as yet
unclear.
Xmas Appeal
The charity 'Help the Aged'
launched its Christmas Carol
Appeal last week, in which people
are asked to go Carol Singing to
raise money for the charity's
minibus service. The 265 minbuses
funded in the last seven years
provide transport for elderly people
so that they do not become isolated
from the rest of the community.
Anyone wishing to help can obtain
carol sheets, badges and collecting
tins from: Help the Aged, St James's
Walk, London EC1R 0BE (Tel: 01-
253 0253).
Exhibit
The Natural History Museum has
opened a new permanent exhibition
entitled "Discovering Mammals".
The exhibition features re-
constructions and fossils and
demonstrates the relationship
between mammals and the
environment. The star exhibits are
the famous 93 foot long blue whale,
the frozen Siberian mammoth, and
a study of the evolution of the horse.
The plights of endangered animals
such as rhinos, tapirs and whales are
highlighted.
Prize winning entries of the Blue
Peter Poster competition for
children are also on display

College is arranging clinical breast
screening sessions at the Royal
Marseden hospital for women in
College over the age of 35. The
examination includes the process of
mammography—a particularly
accurate x-ray technique. Although
primarily intended for College staff,
the service is also available for
female students of this age group.
The cost to the woman being
screened will be £3.50, College pays
a further donation to the hospital.

contacted.
This service has been arranged
following a successful pilot scheme.
