Talking Heads "True Stories"—the
album, the book, the film, the
concept; this was a major project
being launched by one of America's
most respected contemporary
musicians, David Byrne. The great
man hasn't pm a foot wrong in the
past ten years, and the art world was
holding its breath in anticipation of
the next step in his esteemed career.
Mr. Byrne abviously attached great
importance to his new film,
personally introducing the World
Premiere to a packed house,
including thirty members of his own
family.
The film is based on a series of

ile of the title are two
SSffy unruthless people who
kidnap a businessman's wife in
order to get the money they feel he
owes them for plagiarising their
ideas and making a fortune from
them. Unfortunately the man in
question has been planning to do
away with his wife for some lime...
The subplots are both
imaginative and creatively
enmeshed but somehow the jokes
themselves are not quite funny
enough, but it is still fairly
entertaining. The team that bought
you "Airplane" has also created
some very effective parts for Dann\

husband and wife.

various wacky experiences in the

The characters involved are
typically eccentric, some possibly
more apocryphal and caricatured
than others; for example the woman
who is so rich that she stays in bed
all day and the lonely, all-American
guy who advertises his bachelor-
hood on television.
If the film has a message (which
I'm sure it must), it is the stupidity of
the Great American Dream and
how the characters adapt their
mundane lifestyles to escape from it.
There are flashes of brilliance, but
these are unfortunately rather like
music videos and a general
impression of disjointed, unfinished
mediocrity is given. Whether this is
intentionally designed to emphasize
the cynical message, you will have to
decide yourselves. All I will say is
that the audience applauded more at
the beginning than at the end for the
actual film.
"TRUE STORIES" xxxx
David Byrne of Talking Heads
directs a celebration of small town
America portrayed through .1
collection of characters based, in
stones he read in the newspapers.
The film shows an honest man,
desperate for a wife, who advertises
on television, the woman who never
gets out of bed, and others.
• The narration contains many
examples of David Byrne's dry,
surreal "humour like the occasion
when he is about to make a
comment on the difference between
European and American cities but
he forgets it claiming that it is
written down at home somewhere.
The whole film is delightful, well
thought out, acted and photo-
graphed and the music, of course, is
wonderful.
"SMOOTH TALK"xxx
A young girl discovers the
realities of adult life a little too
rapidly and dramatically one
afternoon (Need I say more?).
A cleverly paced and very tense
bilm with some excellent
performances from the young cast.
REMITIES xx
Extremities is probably a better
film than the above star rating might
suggest but the realism of the
violence portrayed makes it a rather
unpleasant film. I say "better" in the
sense that it conveys emotion
extremely effectively.
Farrah Fawcett recreates her
Rage role as the intended victim of
rape who fights back and torments
her attacker on the justification,
probably true, that because no
provable crime has been committed
the "rapist" would be acquitted in a
simple case of her word against his

GONE TO EARTH xx
The latest revival of Britain's
greatest romantic, Michael Powell
which is hard on the heels of
"Colonel Blimp".
A country girl's belief in fate leads
her to marry the local parson, this
soon proves to be against her
desires, which tend towards the
squire.
Once again the woman is
punished for infidelity but with all
Powell-Pressburger films there is a
certain magic which allows some
forgiveness.

"Poor poor poor men!" This is the
sentiment behind Cocteau's classic
reworking of the Oedipus
story—"The Infernal machine" at
the Lyric Hammersmith. In
Cocteau's unique version man, and
eves Gods, are victims caught up in
the cogs and wheels of the infernal
machine, fate. He creates a
dreamscape which he peoples with
these poor tragi-comic pawns, each
treading the fine line between reality
and fantasy. In his characters we
find the 'types of the boulevard'
placed in the forms of the old Greek
protagonists but there is enough of
the 'poetry of theatre and images' to
locate this play far fromrealismat
its stirrcahst roots.
Simon Callow has assembled an
exceuec: production here, one that
Cocteau timself might approve of.
The xarveilous evocation of the
dream atmosphere flags but briefly
in the middle. Only then, the dry ice
having dispersed, does toe old
Gedpus surface from the Cocteau
VMUB although it again submerges
in » stunning theatrical codpiece.
For powerful style and mesmeric
images the production cannot be
faulted.
The best exponent of the dream
person technique is Maggie Smith as
Jocasta. From her flows both
farcical humour and drama,
blending in a vague sense of
detachment that allows no pathos.
Lambert Wilson, the French film
actor, is a perfect Oedipus—entirely
handsome, and fallible. His famous
encounter with the sphinx is perhaps
the thematic and stylistic high point
of the play, deviating as it does from
the accepted mythological version..
However this is no play for
virtuoso solos. Throughout the cast
the actors double up to provide us
with accurate, unfortunate
characters each unobtrusive in the
vision as a whole. Only the
dandified narrator is left to stand
out. blessed or burdened with
knowledge.
But what really of the play? A
masterpiece or a flawed piece ef
higi-camp theatre? Have the old
thirties thoughts grown a little long
m the tooth or is this revival
valuable0
The audacious Cocteau
legend still grows and a trip to
Hammersmith would prove
worthwhile if you are curious.
