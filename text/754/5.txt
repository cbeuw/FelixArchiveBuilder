Featura FELIX, Friday November 14th 1986 5
Far From The
Madding Crowd
Aled Williams describes how he spent the
summer, after winning a travel award
Back in January, still sleepy after
a lecture, I was browsing through
the notices on the Chemical
Engineering notice board when the
International Paint 1986 Travel
Awards poster caught my eye. After
some deliberation, I decided to enter
the ompetition. I obtained an
application form, filled it out and
sent it off. Scarcely would I have
believed that six months later I
would be sitting on a plane bound
for India. My ten weeks travelling
took me over 25,000 miles through
Northern India and China. The
following passages summarise the
journey which the award enabled
me to make.
I stepped off the plane at Delhi
and clutching my guide book I made
my way to the exit. Yellow taxis
swarmed and cabbies haggled with
customers. A short journey by bus
took me to the city centre where,
after some difficulty, I managed to
find a room in a backstreet hotel for
about £2.00 a night. Following a
restless night fending off mosquitos,
I ventured out. In front of the hotel
ran a potholed road where cattle
roamed freely amongst the melee of
morning traffic. People were
cooking at the roadside whilst
others still slept beneath their
blankets. Poverty is a lasting
memory of India; this was the first
of many encounters.
After a few days in Delhi, I moved
north 600 miles to Kashmir. The
journey was intended to last 24
hours but in the event it took three
times as long due to monsoon
floods. The bus described as a
"deluxe video coach" was of a
ramshackle affair. The videos, in
Hindi, ran all night. Kashmir is set
in the foothils of the Himalayas
where the climate is mild, whilst the
rest of India bakes. At Srinigar I
stayed on a plush houseboat which
had been built during the time of the
British Raj. The view from the
verandah was a large lake which
mirrored the snow capped
Himalayan mountains. A n armada
of boats laden with exotic goods
formed a floating market.
Moving south to Rajastan, the red
sandstone forts and palaces of Jaipu
highlighted the next stop. A steep
climb to the turrets of Tiger Fort
provided panoramic views over
Jaipur and the surrounding desert.
The next leg, from Jaipur to Agra,
was by steam train. Wisps of the
engine's smoke filled the carriage
and ash settled on seats and clothes.
Agra is of course the city of the Taj
Mahal. Constructed of white
marble and inlaid with semi-
precious stone, it is a building of
breath-taking beauty. After a brief
stay at the holy city of Varanassi, to
see the bathing in the Ganges, I flew
from Calcutta to Hong Kong via
Bangkok. Hong Kong is an
interesting place in its own right, but
it is also the best place to start a tour
of China.
By ship then from Hong Kong to
Shanghai, where the Yangtze river
pours out into the South China Sea.
Industrially the most important city
in China, it was once known as the
Paris of the East. Indeed, many of
the side streets are still reminiscent
of France. Neon lights, huge
shopping centres, the hotel jazz
bands and 5 million bicycles all
contributed to give the place an
unusual character.
From Shanghai to Peking by
train, a distance of a thousand miles.
Peking is a great city for tourist
attractions, but itself, unlike
Shanghai, seemed to lack colour.
After visiting the Forbidden City
and the Summer Palace, I moved
from Peking to Badaling to see the
Great Wall. The Great Wall is a
magnificent sight, as it winds its way
up steep hills and over horizons for
more than 5,000 miles. As a result of
transport difficulties I ended up
sleeping on the wall. To begin with I
slept in one of the many towers, but
as it was occupied by rats I chose the
open air option. There was a clear
sky that night and at 400 ft. the
temperature dropped very quickly,
but the view of the sunrise made it
all worthwhile.
From Badaling to Xian, the end
of the silk route where the Black
Death is still endemic. This is also
the place to stop off and see the
Terra Cotta warriors, a 2000 year
old army of life-size soldiers in battle
formation. After Xian I moved on
to Chongqing and took a three day
cruise along the Yangtze, the world'
third longest river, to Wuhan. On
the way are beautiful gorges where
300ft. cliffs rise up from the water.
From Wuhan south to Hong Kong
by train. A memorable journey 19
hours sitting on a rucsac, dodging
the expectorations of the 'Chinese
Passengers'. Hong Kong was the
last stop, regretably, and with
lectures looming in a week's time I
had to head for London.
If you are in your penultimate
year at College, then don't make the
mistake of not entering the 1987
International Paint Travel Awards
scheme. You could be in distant
lands sooner than you think.
