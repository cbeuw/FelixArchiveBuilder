Hamlet Havoc
Students smashed down the door to
the 121-130 block of Hamlet Gardens
when they were unable to gain
entrance to the building last
Thursday. New locks were fitted on
Wednesday in the wake of the rape
incident on October 19th, but visitors
were unable to contact residents in
Hamlet as the entry phones were not
in working order. A breakdown in
communications meant that Hamlet
Gardens were not informed of the
plan to install locks. The House
Warden, Geoff Hungerford, was
forced to climb in through a window
when he discovered the locks had been
fitted.
Mr Hungerford later fastened the
locks with sticky tape to allow
visitors entry, and to allow students
from other blocks access to the
laundry. The tape was removed,
however, in spite of M r
Hungerford's attempts to ask the
students not to use the locks.
The locks were installed at the
request of the Rector following
discussions with Union President,
Christine Taig. Student Services
Officer Don Ferguson wrote to the
landlords requesting that locks be
fitted at the College's expense to the
120-130 block, in spite of the lack of
entry phones. Mr Ferguson later
told FELIX that he was not
personally in favour of the locks,
but had been instructed to write the
letter.
The landlord's representative, Mr
David Fussel, said the locks, which
cost £300 to install, were a waste of
money, and that there was no point
in fitting them before the entry
phones were working. He pointed
out, however, that he was anxious to
help the College in it's attempts to
improve Hamlet's security, and said
that new entry phones were due for
installation within three weeks. The
£3000 cost of the phones will be met
by the landlords, Strollmoor.
QMC Mascotry Team
Raid Fire Engine
Jezebel, the motorised mascot of
RCSU, was violated by students
from Queen Mary College last
Sunday. The veteran fire engine was
sprayed with artificial snow, and the
brass bell, worth several hundred
pounds, was stolen. The door of the
RCS motor club garage had been
forced open, and Jez had been
sprayed with the slogan " Q M C '86
free Mary or else." The message
refers to the QMC mascot, Mary, a
leopard, which has been- in the
possession of the RCS mascotry
team for over three years.
RCSU Vice President Judith
Hackney contacted QMC Union on
Monday morning to negotiate the
return of the bell. Q M C Union
officers were initially unable to trace
the raiders.
On Wednesday two Q M C
students called at IC Union Office
and were given a list of everything
which had been stolen from RCSU
by the Q M C mascotry team in the
last thtee years. The list includes a
rotor-arm, a set of RCS rugby shirts,
Bamber the Duck, Fagan the
Rabbit, and Fluffy the Squirrel. In
addition, Q M C are expected to
return a set of wheels from an IC
Union van, which were stolen two
years ago, as a "goodwill gesture".
Ms. Hackney told FELIX that
the removal of these items was
technically theft, because none of
them are violate mascots of RCSU.
"If Q M C can't play by mascotry
rules, then there's no point in
playing with them", she said.
JCR To
Stay
The college has decided not to go
ahead with last year's plans to
rehouse the Junior Common Room
(JCR) in the Sherfield Refectory. As
a result the space available in the
JCR has been drastically reduced
and the Union will be unable to
make full use of its facilities before
the QT food outlet closes at 5pm.
Originally it was intended that the
JCR would be swapped with the
Sherfield Refectory and that a
central kitchen would be installed to
provide food from the Senior
Dining Hall and a smaller student
refectory. These plans were rejected
when an unexpected increase in the
number of students using the
Sherfield Refectory was discovered.
The college now feels the refectory
should not be made smaller in the
light of the planned increase in the
number of students over the next
few years.
IC Union are unhappy about the
move and will either be pressing for
the original plans to be put into
action or for the college to provide
appropriate compensation. They
are particularly concerned that the
plans to install the QT Snack Bar
were agreed to on the basis that the
JCR would be relocated.
Engineering
Units
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash has
proposed that a system of 'course
units' be introduced into the
E n g i n e e r i n g D e p a r t m e n t s .
Speaking at the Engineering Studies
Committee on Wednesday, the
Rector pointed out that the system
would reduce the high Engineering
failure rate and would enable
interdepartmental and intercolleg-
iate courses to take place.
Course Units are already in use in
the Science Departments which
have a failure rate of 2% compared
to a rate of 12% in Engineering.
Under the system, courses are
divided into 'equal packets of
information' and it is not essential to
pass every unit to gain a degree.
