This is going to be pretty short but
it's been a hectic week and I'm
getting close to my deadline.

The situation regarding student
residences is getting desperate. Lots
of places will have been lost by the
end of this year due to conversion of
rooms and the loss of two blocks of
flats at Hamlet Gardens. The
number of students at the college is
on the increase; 500 more are
expected in the long term. This
means that the guarantee of a place
in hall for undergraduates and
overseas postgraduates is in
jeopardy. Union Council discussed
this fact at some length and decided
that we must oppose the loss of the
guarantee either by insisting that
new accomodation be found or by
opposing the increase in student
numbers. I shall be hassling every
available College person about this.
Any comments would be welcome.

After the building of the QT
snack bar, College's original idea for
the Sherfield building was to make
the downstairs dining hall into the
new JCR, with the current JCR
becoming a dining hall.
This plan has now been changed
as apparently the number of
students eating in the Sherfield
building is so large, the big room
downstairs is still needed as a dining
hall. If the new plans go ahead the
JCR will be considerably smaller
than it was in the past. Anyone who
would like to see the College plans
for the JCR and dining hall and add
their voice to the discussion, come
to a meeting with the College
Surveyor on Monday 17 November
at 12.30pm in the Union Dining
Hall, first floor of the Union
Building.

The first meeting of the Union
Planning Group is on Monday 24th
November at 6 pm. in the Union
Building (see next week's FELLX for
exact details). The idea of this group
is that ANY ONE with an interest in
the longterm future of the
Union—both its organisation and
its building—can come along and
talk about various ideas, like having
a new sabbatical, opening a new
food outlet..etc. You don't have to
be a "hack" to turn up, in fact the
more real students the better.

Going to university is for many
people the first time they leave
home. This page is an attempt to try
and assist in solving many of the
little problems one encounters when
trying to keep body and soul
together without Mummy and
Daddy's help.
The one thing which seems to
take up an inordinate amount of
both mental and physical energy is
the constantly recurring question:
"what am I going to eat today? How
do I manage to produce something
edible?" Since this is a subject close
to everybody's heart, we shall turn
to it first. If there are any gourmet
chefs among you readers, please
bear with me-it is necessary to start
at a very simple level.
This week's recipe:Baked Beans

Equipment needed: One
saucepan, one tin opener, one hot
ring or cooker, toaster or grill, one
plate, one knife and one fork
(optional).
Method: Cut two pieces of bread,
or take two slices of bread if from a
pre-sliced pack. Place bread under
grill of cooker or into toaster.
Switch on (check that it is also
switched on at the mains). Open tin
with tin opener (see diagrams).
Empty contents into saucepan. Put
saucepan on ring of cooker. Switch
on ring to medium (half way along
dial if ring is electrical or half inch
flames if gas ring). Check bread is
not burning by looking at it, turn the
bread round if you want it toasted
on both sides if you are using a grill.
Stir the beans with the fork. When
beans are at the desired temperature
and the bread has acquired the right
degree of burning, put toast onto the
plate and pour the beans on top.
Switch off all electrical or gas
appliances. Now eat.
Garnishes: If one wishes one can
spread some butter on to the toast
before pouring on the beans.
Washing up
It is advisable to pour cold water
into the saucepan as soon as the
beans have been poured on to the
toast as this makes the chore of
washing up much easier. Congealed
three week old beans are very hard
to remove.
If you have any favourite recipe
please send it in and I will be glad to
print it. Especially useful would be
hangover antidotes and household
hints. If there are any topics you
would particularly like to have
covered please do not hesitate to
write.
