Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes.
If you think Shell means simply a career in oil, think again.
We can probably offer you more variety than you ever imagined. From rompany finance forecasting
to the marketing and project evaluation of natural gas. From personnel to research.
With us, the world's your oyster. Because we're always evolving new and exciting ways to satisfy
the constantly changing requirements of our industry.
Naturally, if you're going to be part of our future, you'll need to be pretty versatile yourself.
Someone who's capable of meeting new challenges head on. Yet who also displays the very best in
business, technological or creative skills.
If all this sounds interesting come along and meet our representatives
at our presentation Commercial Careers in Shell' on Tuesday, 25th November from 6pm in
Committee Room 327, Sherfield Building
