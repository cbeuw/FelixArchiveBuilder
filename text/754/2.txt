I Come
To Bury
John Martin
Dear Sir
To quote John Martin "it would
appear that silly season is once again
upon us" and I would refer you to
his article as a prime example of
what he calls "the ridiculous".
The leaflets distributed outside
the Careers Fair only questioned a
career in an armaments industry.
Surely this is just giving the other
side of the story to the glossy
pictures of fast fighter aircraft, the
sleek missiles, etc., so far removed
from the horrific effects their use
has...I cannot see anyone using the
Careers Fair "for political
purposes" there. So the distributors
were "grossly arrogant"? Well,
John Martin says so, and "he is an
honourable man".
He talks of a contrast between
these distributors' "cowardly
pathos" and the "heroic people who
are willing to lay down their lives in
defence of freedom". The leaflets
were concerned with the designers
and constructors of the armaments,
and as these people are not those
who will use the weapons in the
field, let alone "give their lives....",
one can hardly make a comparison.
He finishes with "we honour the
dead by making a contribution to
the injured and not by deriding their
successors." Is this meant to imply
that the distributors of the leaflets
were not honouring the dead? Are
the "successors" to those who fell or
were injured in the war the designers
of today's weapons? Were these
"successors" being derided at all?
Yet, John Martin says they were and
"he is an honourable man".
Throughout, John Martin plays
on the emotions of the reader with
the use of words such as "heroic",
"lay down their lives", "defence of
freedom"—these soldiers, the
liberators of the concentration
camps (note the details he goes into)
are portrayed as the "good guys".
That is fine—what sickens me is the
way that the "cowardly" leaflet
distributors are contrasted with this
picture. What sort of impression is
this supposed to give? What sort of
gut reaction? Yet, John Martin does
this—and, unlike the cowards, I am
sure "he is an honourable man".
Are we merely honouring our war
dead and forgetting the reason
behind their death? We may not
have armies ready to invade us now,
but as we point more and more
weapons towards "potential
aggressors", we have lost the peace,
the safer world that these people
died for.
We many not be at war, but we
are certainly not at peace.

Dear Dave
I read with interest Jonathan
Turners' rather simple-minded view
of WIST (FELIX 753), and I take
considerable exception to his
including us in the definition of
sexism that has been used against
the CCU drinking clubs.
Firstly, may I say, WIST does not
constitutionally exclude men and in
fact we have quite an active male
membership. This is no doubt due to
the fact that feminism is not a battle
in which women want to beat down
and subject men to disadvantages,
but a branch of Human Rights
aimed at improving life for all
(chauvinists excepted). If only more
men could put up an effective
resistance to the demeaning and
obscene treatment of women in all
forms of the media—including
common speech, swearwords and
jokes, then we would achieve much
faster results.
Platform
Policy
Dear Dave
I read with interest the letters
from John Martin and friends in last
weeks FELIX. There are a couple of
points I would like to raise in reply.
Firstly, GUC did NOT debate, or
vote upon, the 'No Platform' issue.
What was discussed was the
principle of the government
interfering directly with students's
unions, and telling them what they
can or cannot do in their own
sphere. In fact there were many
people at the meeting who disagreed
with the 'No Platform' principle,
but who nevertheless voted for the
right of students's unions to decide
for themselves democratically.
Secondly, I must reply to M r
M a r t i n ' s comments about
homosexuals at Imperial College. It
However, in view of the low level
of support from men on the one
hand, and their record of persistent
and abusive opposition to women's
attempts to improve their status on
the other, it is not surprising that we
should want to meet together
occasionally in an informal
atmosphere, where we can find relief
from the constricting attitudes that
exist in this College
Personally, I see the C C U
drinking clubs as an embodiment of
these attitudes and so it is because of
the existence of these institutions
hose only contribution to the image
of the College as far as I can see is to
preserve the so-called "Macho-
Culture" that we need to have a
women's group in College.
The idea that consuming vast
amounts of alcohol enhances ones'
masculinity is a fallacious one—ask
any women and she will reply that
you are a lot less of a man after a
night on the be
Finally, I suggest that Mr. Turner
forms a "Persons in Science and
Technology" Group, as he and his
chauvinistic cronies would no doubt
identify admirably with the fitting
acronym it produces!
Yours,
Jane Bowie
(President of WIST)
is quite likely that he has never been
harrassed about his supposed or
actual homosexuality; I have. So
have many friends and aquaintances
of mine. My comments about
homophobia arise from first and
secondhand experience and from
keeping my eyes and ears open. Mr
Martin's argument typifies the all
too common attitude: T have not
experienced this problem; therefore
it does not exist.' So you may be
quite happy developing your
sexuality on your own—but if the
gay minority at Imperial wish to
overcome isolation and offer
support in the face of prejudice, who
are you to stop them? As far as I am
aware, this is not forcing anything
down anyone's throat—merely
offering an opportunity to make life
at Imperial happier for some
students.
And of course there is a
heterosexual society here—it's
called Imperial College Union...
Yours,
Christine Taig
College administration have done a
complete U-turn on the long-running
reorganisation of the JCR and the
main Sherfield Refectory. The switch
of the two rooms was first planned
several years ago and the Union
agreed to a specific set ofplansfor the
changeover, which effectively
involved a simple switch between the
Dining Hall on the groundfloor and
the JCR on thefirst. Earlier this week
Union sabbatical officers were
presented with a set of plans for a
totally different scheme and it is clea
that the College is now taking a 'We
shall not be moved stance. The switch
offacilities ispart complete, however,
and the current JCR now has the QT
Fast Food Bar encroaching
significantly imto the Union's space-
the present proposals will reduce
available spacefurther still. Whether
this change of heart has come about
simply because the money is no longe
available is hard to say, but it is a
sickening example of how College is
capable of brushing Union opinion
aside if it so chooses. It was a
particularly adept move by admin, to
entrust College Deputy Secretary
Brian Lloyd-Davies, the most
pro-Union man in Sherfield, with the
task of explaining the College's
turnaround to the Union
representatives.

I should like to see the written conten
of FELIX expand next term. If you
have even vaguely considered
contributing to the paper, or if you
signed up at Freshers' Fair and since
found that you do not have as much
spare time as you had hoped please
drop into the Office anytime and see
how FELIX works. We are
particularly in need ofpeople to join
Bill Goodwin's team of news
hounds-writing the news involves
researching stories on Tuesday and
Wednesday afternoons andwriting up
on Wednesday evening. You need no
give up very muchtimeto write for
FELIX and it is fairly easy to learn
how to write news style. FELIX also
needs a selection of lively features,
reviews, etc, so you can concentrate
on the type of writing which interests
you most.
