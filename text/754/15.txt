U L U T o G o ?
The University of London Union
faces potentially massive financial
cuts if a proposed change to central
university funding goes ahead. The
UGC, the government 'Quango'
responsible for university funding, is
threatening to cut the budget for the
university central precinct by 50%.
This money normally covers the
central university administration at
Senate House, the University of
London Libraries, Careers and
Welfare Services and ULU. It is
believed by the U L U administration
that the Senate is unlikely to cut
itself and hence that the brunt of
cuts will be born by the Union and
Welfare Services.
U L U is currently assessing
strategies for opposing cuts and
already plans to lobby Senate on
Wednesday 10th December. It is not
fully clear what the effect of
substantial cuts to U L U would be
but it is certain that U L U clubs and
societies would suffer. The U L U
building itself has a considerable
turnover from its bars and services
and is currently in a healthy state.
However the removal of the
subsidy to the Union could put it in
a perilous financial position.
The U L U building requires a
large staff and capital is needed to
develop it for the future.
Jane Cannon, U L U President, is
confident that she can win the
support of the Senate. " U L U was
successful in winning the
University's opposition to the
introduction of student loans" she
said and continued "I am confident
we can be successful in our
campaign to prevent cuts in central
student services". Sir Peter
Swinerton-Dyer, Chairman of the
UGC, has been quoted as saying
that U L U was the most efficiently
run building in the University of
London. It is likely that Sir Peter's
comment will be used as strong
evidence to support ULU.
There is concern that cutting
U L U funding could have severe
long term consequences. U L U
serves a very large number of
students in the Bloomsbury area
including a serviceable number
from Imperial who live in
intercollegiate halls. Lesley
Gillingham, IC welfare advisor, said
that the importance of Central
Welfare Services could not be
underestimated especially for small
colleges, Mr. Gillingham has past
experience working for ULU. Some
Union officers have privately
expressed fears that U L U may be
eventually close if it loses money.
Alternative Prospectus
The Alternative Prospectus will
continue to be produced biannually,
it was decided at Council on
Monday. The current AP Editor,
Miss Sunny Bains, had asked
Council ftxgive a firm directive so
that she could proceed with the
publication of this year's issue.
It was decided to make the A P a
biannual production two years ago,
in an attempt to cut the budget for
Publications' Board. Council

chairman Hugh Southey, who was
Pub Board chairman at that time,
defended the original decision to
produce an AP once every two
years, saying that there was not
sufficient demand to warrant a
publication every year.
Current Pub Board chairman
Chris Martin proposed that the AP
should be reinstated as an annual
production, but this was defeated on
the vote.
DoC Credit
The British Computer Society
(BCS) visited the Department of
Computing on Tuesday to assess the
computing course for accreditation.
If the course is accepted Computing
students will be exempt from taking
the Society's exams although they
will still be obliged to complete the
necessary practical training before
becoming an associate. A
spokesman from the department
described the visit as "very
successful" but added that DoC
would have to wait for written
confirmation of accreditation.

the weekend. Guilds Lord Mayor's Show co-ordinator Andy MacDonald
described the day as a great success.
Bringing The House
Down
A resident in Holbein House
escaped serious injury two weeks
ago when the ceiling of his bedroom
collapsed. On returning from
playing football on Saturday
November lst, the student found
that a block of material measuring
about 5 feet by 3 feet had fallen onto
his desk and bed. The debris
included copper piping, plaster-
board and brickwork; the
floorboards and beams were all that
remained of the ceiling. In addition
a significant amount of water had
leaked into the room.
The room concerned was a new
one which had been converted from
a 'half-landing' in the recent
renovation, and was directly below
the bathroom. Because of a Holbein
House party on Saturday night
there was no other room available in
the House, and the student ended up
staying with a friend in Southside.
On Sunday the room was cleaned
and since then the student has been
living in a Holbein House guest-
room. Holbein warden Barry
Saunders brought the matter to the
attention of Student Services Officer
Don Ferguson and enquired about
the possibility of a rent rebate for the
student. Mr Ferguson said that the
matter would be taken to the
Student Residence Committee
(SRC). He later told FELIX that,
from the evidence presented to him,
the disruption caused appeared
'relatively minor' and as such would
not qualify for a rebate if considered
by the SRC. He stressed that he did
not have the power to authorise a
rebate, and that the structural
condition of Holbein House was the
direct responsibility of Peter
Hallworth, the Managing Surveyor
(Residences).
A significant insurance claim has
been filed with ICU Hon Sec, Dave
Colley on behalf of the student
concerned.
More Students
The College will be increasing it's
intake of students over the next few
years in order to comply with the
University Grants Commission's
requirements. Imperial, which has a
high staff-student ratio, has been
asked to increase it's 'home student'
quota by 10%, and also plans to
increase the number of overseas
students by 250. The move is likely
to result in a shortage in available
student accommodation, particu-
larly with the loss of the 250 places
from Hamlet Gardens next year.
The College will be discussing the
possibility of droppong the
guaranteed one year in hall, or
replacing it with a guaranteed place
in College controlled accommo-
dation comprising halls, head
tenancies and houses.
