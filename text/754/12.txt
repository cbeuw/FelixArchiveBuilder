Essential
Rugby, 5/11/86:
IC 1st XV 25, Surrey 1st XV 7
IC 2nd XV 3, Surrey 2nd XV15
IC played their fourth and final
U A U group match against Surrey
University knowing that it was
essential to win, and win well, to
ensure a reasonable chance of
progressing through to the next
round. Although handicapped by
injury and also by U L U duty for two
players, IC did not disappoint, and
scored a convincing win over a very
reasonable Surrey team. IC kicked
off, and immediately went on the
attack, pressurising the Surrey fly-
half into mis-kicking a touch
clearance and conceding a lineout
on their 22-metre line. Then
followed some fine sustained
pressure from the IC pack, which
resulted in fly-half Mike Anderson
driving over in the corner for the
opening score of the match. Surrey
pulled back to 4-3 with a well-kicked
penalty, but this was swiftly negated
by Mike Anderson kicking one over
to make ICstill four points ahead at
7-3. The IC line was running very
well, and the Surrey defence was
becoming more rattled with every
IC attack. Jimmy Sheik burst
through on the wing from the IC
line, having been sent away by Mike
Tester, to score IC's second try.
Mike Anderson put over another
penalty, and then it was the turn of
the IC pack. Hooker Andy Martin
charged down a clearance by Surrey
from behind their try-line, but the
try was disallowed. However,
eighth-man Nige Lee did the
honours after the IC pack had
pushed over from the resulting five-
yard scrum. Half time went with IC
18-3 up. The second half saw IC
playing into the wind, and they were
held back to a certain extent by the
long touch-kicks from the Surrey
defence. IC worked their way back
up the field, though, with the backs
macking good use of the possession
given them by the pack, and second
row Nyall McKay drove through
the Surrey fly-half to score. Surrey
did not give up though, and
managed to get one in reply, but
after Mike Anderson kicked his
third penalty, making the score 25-
7, the match was sealed.
Physical
On Saturday 1st November, the
University of London Korfball
team, including 4 players from
Imperial, participated in the first
tournament of the season in
Brighton.
Despite atrocious weather
conditions, U L won their group
fairly comfortably recording
victories over Sussex University, 2-
1, and over two teams from
Brighton, 1-0 and 5-0.
This put them into the final
against the hosts, Brighton
Polytechnic. In a very physical
match, UL hung on to win 3-2 and
so successfully defended the title
they won last year.
Stricken
Football, 8/11/86: IC 2nd XI 2,
K Q C 2nd XI 1
IC once again had a 2nd's team
stricken by injury, players nicked by
the first team and players going to
parties in Birmingham. Never-
theless this makeshift side showed
iron character to pull off this result.
The game had its usual start for the
2nd's with the midfield attack
playing reasonably well but with the
defence looking uncomfortable.
Indeed it was fortunate that D .
Martin the Keeper had had a quiet
Friday night and was in fine fettle
for the afternoon's play. As the first
half wore on IC started to take
control and this paid off when Bill
Mason combined with Ian Hardy
who again found the net for IC.
KQC hit back quickly though when
a defensive error let in their
enormous centre forward to score
easily. That's how it stayed till half-
time. Barrow (IC's charismatic
player manager) made a decisive
tactical change at half-time and IC
started playing with more
confidence. Goals were difficult to
come by though and it wasn't until
the 77th minute when good work
from S. Gordon and W. Buckley let
in Hardy for his 2nd of the game.
Then K Q C threw everything
forward and the battling strengths
of Adams, Barrow, Holland,
Dunthorne and Vandenbegin were
again tested, and found to hold true.
So the 2nd's went through to the
quarter finals of the cup, and, oh
yes, Neill Macdonald was also on
the pitch—enough said.
Real
Ale
There was, as promised, more to
drink at last week's Real Ale Society
meeting, but there were
considerably fewer people to drink
it and this had interesting
consequences.
For the next meeting, we are
having a special delivery of four
brews from Burton Bridge, a small
independant brewery. The OGS
suggest that there may be fatal
consequenceJ if you don't A L L turn
up on FRIDAY 21st November.
(Extra Day for recovery after I.C.
Beer Festival.)
Colin Trotman
Ten Pin
Bowling
Yes—we're back. The club that
takes more beatings than Harvey
Proctor's rent-boy, and has more
members not turning up each week
than Parliament.
This week we play Portsmouth in
a bid to extend our losing run to
twelve matches in a hope that we can
attract Ron Atkinson to the team.
So, if anyone wants to wish us
luck before we leave then we'll see
you Saturday, 8.45 am outside Beit
Quad. If you think this is pointless
then think about this: It can't be as
pointless as we'll be when we get
back!
