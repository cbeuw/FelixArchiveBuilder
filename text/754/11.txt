Drama
Football, 5/11/86: IC 1st XI 4,
Surrey 1st XI 3
IC's final U A U game in the
preliminary round brought not only
almost certain qualification to the
national section of the competition,
but also extended their unbeaten
run to nine games. But victory, as
usual, was won only after many
heartbeats were lost.
IC started well. Surrey's attacking
movements, though complicated,
were efficiently dealt with by the IC
defence and the sheer pace of IC's
counter-attacks caused all sorts of
problems to a somewhat square and
slow Surrey back four. One of the
counter-attacks released Dave
Lynne on the left who crossed to an
unmarked Nigel Collier, who
finished as usual. Philippe Ewart,
playing out of position at centre-
half, made it 2^0 with a powerful
near post header from a corner. IC
were now completely over-running
the opposition and the Surrey
defence did not seem to know what
to do against such a sharp and pacey
front-line as Lynne and Collier were
presenting. However, five minutes
before half-time, IC's goalkeeper,
Andy Allen, made his first serious
mistake of the season and allowed
Surrey to pull a goal back.
IC were quick to pull back the
two-goal cushion in the second half
as Alex (!!!) Lunghi beat the Surrey
offside trap from a Simon Cole pass
and netted comfortably. Surrey
rallied well, however, as their fine
Chinese midfielder, Pak (at least,
that is what Surrey were calling
him), began to run the game and
they scored two goals to equalise
with 15 minutes to go. IC piled
forward as only victory would stand
them any chance of qualifying. A
goalmouth scramble ended with
Dave Lynne's shot being handled on
the line by a Surrey defender: a
penalty, with 5 minutes to go, was
awarded. The pressure was too
much for IC's Captain, who bottled
out of the responsibility, leaving it
instead for Phillippe Ewart, who
calmly slotted it in the centre of the
goal, past the feet of the already
committed Surrey Keeper. What
greater drama to give IC victory.

Thunderous
Football, Upper Reserves Cup
Round 1: U C IV 1, IC III 7
Last Saturday IC 3rds had an
emphatic cup win, albeit against
second rate opposition. After
conceding an early goal in the first
minutes, Martin Dixon equalised
turning in a rebound from a
powerful Wendel Charles shot.
Nfflce Plummer put the 3rds ahead a
minute later with a thunderous left
foot drive from the edge of the area.
Fast, sweeping football carried out
more chances, two gratefully
accepted by Martin Dixon, both
opportunist goals in the six yard
box, to complete ^is hat trick.
With the wind in ^ ... iavourin the
second half, more goals were bound
to arrive. Having spurned a few
chances, a swift attack down the left
Resounding
Ladies Badminton, 5/11/86: IC
v Surrey
Despite an early warning of a
Middlesex county player in Surrey's
squad, the IC ladies set out knowing
that to win this match would put
them top of the group.
All eyes were anxiously watching
the first gameâ€”IC's first pair
against Surrey's lst pair. The first
end was commandingly taken by IC
pair, 15-4, but Surrey fought back
bravely as they settled into their
rhythm to win the second end. The
third and final end was another very
Retaliation
Football, 8/11/86, UILU
Challenge Cup 1st round: IC
1st XI 3, New College 1
IC eased into the quarter finals of
the U L U Challenge Cup by beating
the much fancied New College.
Although in the end it was a
comfortable victory, IC did not play
at their best, especially in a sterile
first half that was played mostly in
midfield. The only glimmer of a
chance fell to Nigel Collier, whose
shot was expertly tipped away by the
New keeper.
IC's second half performance was
altogether more convincing. Five
minutes into the half Alex Lunghi's
left-foot volley from 20 yards beat
flank and a pinpoint cross by Mike
Plummer left Wendel Charles with
time and space to coolly slot the ball
pass the shell-shocked UC keeper. A
brilliant set piece saw the sixth goal;
a flighted cross from Chris Budger,
after a Paul Thompson dummy run,
was flicked on by Mark Woodgate
and Paul, continuing his run, drove
the ball fiercely into the bottom
corner.
The final nail in the UC coffin
came from Dave Semeria. After
seeming somewhat reluctant to part
with the ball, he produced a
beautiful chip destined for the top
corner, only to be cruelly denied by
a diving U C defender who
desperately palmed the ball away.
Not to be outdone, Dave drilled
home the spot-kick to emphasize
our superiority, and complete a
resounding victory.

even affair, but the Surrey pair had a
slight edge in out-manoeuvering our
pair to finally clinch the game, 15-
12.
The first game was certainly the
most exciting, but we then had to
settle down and win 5 of the
remaining 8 to win the match. Each
of the 3 IC pairs beat Surrey's 2nd
and 3rd pairs, which gave us 6
games, to Surrey's 3.
So, the final result, a 6-3 win for
IC Ladies badminton, putting them
top of their group for the third year
running. Now comes the challenge
to better the performance of 1985/6,
when IC ladies badminton lost to
Loughborough 5-4 in the finals.

the stranded keeper, only to thunder
onto the crossbar. However, five
minutes later, he put the home side
in front when he latched on to Dave
Lynne's flick and this time his strike
found the top corner. Dave Lynne
made it 2-0 when he chipped over
the advancing keeper into an empty
net. New College's retaliation was
predictable, but IC's defence was
very solid, led by Jim Wilson on his
debut. New College hit the post
once, but apart from this all their
attacks were comfortably held. New
College pulled one back five
minutes from time, when their
winger supplied an easy goal for
their centre forward. On the stroke
of full-time, however, Paul Olden
netted comfortably from a Mike
Porter corner to give the scoreline a
little bit more realism.
