Down & Out Mark 1
If you haven't been to the flicks
lately, for want of some audio visual
experience that will do more than
transit from one earhole to the
other, I don't blame you. Even a
cursory glance at most of the large
cinema billings shows them to be
sadly lacking. While good cinema is
still being produced it is shown on
fewer occasions, at even fewer
venues.
Nor does it do much good for
cinema when 'quality' productions,
such as the ill fated Revolution, in
which millions have been invested,
would have been aided by the simple
purchase of a tripod for the camera.
So, if you find the 'micro-
intellects in macro-jets' of Top Gun
a turn off, or Nightmare on Elm
Street cinematically just that, then
it's worth scouting around the
independent flea pits for a film that's
more likely to be worth the cash.
Many of the films may not be new,
but if you missed them first time
round, you've no excuse to miss
them again.
Among those winging their way
across the screens last week were
Diva, a superbly tense thriller from
82, Bloodwedding, a feast of
Spanish dance and music from 81,
and Clockwise, last years' offering
from John Cleese, a hectic tale of
bad time keeping, Fawlty Style. If
none of the above strikes a chord
with you, then I suggest you stick
your head back in the commercial
mire.
After all this, you've probably
decided to forget about the movies
and stay at home: don't. Get out to
the I C A and catch Michael
Nyman's 'The Man who Mistook
His Wife For a Hat', electronic
opera with a difference. Nyman
r
own & o ut in London
produced the haunting music for
Channel 4's 'The Draughtsman's
Contract', and his style is both
stunning and humourous. The piece
deals with a disorder known as
Agnosia in which the codes of
memory, vision and language desert
the sufferer. If this reminds you of
post barnight effects, you may well
click with 'Hat'.
Otherwise you can always slap
'Liverpool', Frankie Goes to
Hollywood's new album on the
turntable and reflect that however
hard they may rage, Frankie are
destined to be forgotten.

Down & Out Mark 2
If the standard Imperial disco
party in the Concert Hall/Dining
Hall/JCR is not giving you the kick
it once did, and you're tired of
seeing the nameless face of some
first year physicist talking to
another nameless face and you've
decided that rather than venting
your feelings on the Union Exec,
you'd take the immensely daring
and adventurous step of forsaking
the Imperial sheep flock; (Groovy
conditional clause hey?) then the
London Film Festival is a good
place to start. It goes on mainly at
the National Film Theatre from
whom box tickets can be bought
until one and half hours before the
start of any film. They can also be
bought until half an hour before,
from the relevant- location, but it is
wise to buy well in advance, not only
because you're probably going to
have to go to the N FT anyway for a
programme; due to the huge
number and variety of films but also
because many of the popular films
are expected to sell out. The Festival
lasts until November 30th, and
almost all tickets are £3.75, which is
probably why it's only a good place
to start.
Nearer to home there's an
exhibition of Erich Salomon
photographs, for those that way
inclined, at the Goethe Institute, 50
Princes Gate. Salomon was one of
the fathers of modern journalistic
photography and captured many
leading figures of the 20's and 30's
with a candour highly unusual at the
time. Even if you ^ that way
inclined, find time to have a look:
there's nothing to lose since
admission is free, and who knows? It
might change your life.
For the musically minded, there's
the Guitar Weekend 1986. This
takes place at the Barbican Centre
(Barbican Tube) and includes an
exhibition by guitar makers,
performances by leading players
and a large selection of electrics and
non-electric guitars for you to play.
Better than staring at priceless
treasures in glass cases. (OK, so you
can't play a Ming vase....wait a
moment I wonder if-well, anyway,
you get the drift.)
As usual, there's a hundred
billion different art exhibitions on
including, no doubt:"Fingernail
drawing techniques by Italian artists
in the 18th century" but one which
might take the fancy of those
interested in the noble subject of the
interface of Art with Science is 'Art
meets Science' in Shelton St. WC2.
(Nearest tube Covent Garden.) This
is an exhibition of the best 'New
Scientist' covers of the last five
years. Admission is free and I'd
certainly recommend dropping in if
you happen to be going to Covent
Garden. It goes on until the 23rd
November.
Anyway, here are a few things
which I hope whet your appetite, so
why not try one and give that
physicist's ugly mug a miss?

MEGABRAIN
I was at a complete loss to find a
puzzle this week, mainly due to a
lack of spare time, so a bright spark
suggested that I offer this week's five
pound prize to the person who
submits the best original puzzle (by
original I mean anything that hasn't
appeared in FELIX before) by the
usual deadline of Wednesday
lunchtime. Not only will the winner
receive the aforementioned huge
cash prize, but they'll get their
puzzle published as well.
Replies, along with any
comments or criticisms (which are
always welcome), to the
MEGABRAIN box in the FELIX
Office by 1.00pm Wednesday,
please.
Last week-TT Soc again
A piece of pure logical thinking,
this (unless you solved it by trial and
error, of course). Rules 2 and 6 were
incorrect, the others were correct.
The winner was Andrew Napier
Civ. Eng. PG, well done. You can
collect your £5 prize after 1.00pm
Monday.
