Accommodation Shambles
Tom Melliar-Smith (ICU Welfare Officer), David Lowrle (ICU
AAO), and Ian Howgate (ICU S R C Rep) express concern over the
College's plans for student residences
Residence has always been a
major problem at IC. Anyone who
has had to look for a place to live in
L o n d o n knows how time
consuming it can be. They also
understand what poor quality
accommodation one can end up in,
often for quite excessive rents when
compared to the rest ofthe country.
Let us describe to you the present
situation along with College's
proposals for dealing with it and
future propsals, flaws in colleges
proposals and our suggested
possible solutions.
The Present Situtaion
There is annually an overall
increase of students, but this
increase hides a fall in the
percentage of home students; the
number of which controls the
amount of money College receives
from the University Grants
Committee (UGC) i.e. Govern-
ment.
Meanwhile the number of places
in IC accommodation has fallen,
which this year has resulted in many
returning students finding
themselves homeless and freshers
being placed in wholly in-
appropriate accommodation. At the
same time many departments have
found themselves not necessarily
short of space, but short of up to
date equipment and facilities for
undergraduates.
The Apparent Proposals By College
Improve funding by increasing
home undergraduate numbers by
10%—in principle we agree with this
as tax payers money ought to benefit
students from this country. The
College's solution to the residence
problem is to state that there is no
immediate problem! They add that
in the long term a new hall (above
the sports centre) would provide 120
"expensive" places to Postgraduates
and "some form" of answer to the
problem in approximately five to six
years time. Due to the increase in the
number of home UG's. the Rector
has already given his opinion that
the guarantee of residence to
overseas P.G.'s should be dropped!
In order to circumvent possible
departmental overcrowding,
College have proposed an
integrated timetabling of lectures
throughout College lecture
theatres—which in theory is a
sensible idea.
Problems with the College Proposals
We see the necessity of the 10%
increase of home UG's, but how, we
ask, are College going to
accommodate these extra students
satisfactorily into the departments
and into residences?
College's attitude that there is no
residence problem is ludicrous.
College must do something now to
increase the number of residence
places, that is start setting up more
Head Tenancy Accommodation.
Their long term "answer"—the
new hall—will cost approximately
five to six million pounds and will
take around five years to build.
Even if Student Residence
Committee (SRC) managed to get
an unlikely rate of interest on this six
million of as low as 1.5%, the
income from the 120 places created
(at an estimated £40 per student per
week) will just pay the interest, and
SRC will have a six million pound
debt for ever.
The short term accommodation
problem is yet more acute, as
College have already guaranteed
places in residence for next years
Fresher's, both U G and overseas
PG's. It therefore seems likely that
an increased number will have to be
placed in accommodation less
suited to Freshers,and a even more
than in the past may find themselves
homeless! Also, it may be of interest
to note that we shall be loosing 160
places in Hamlet Gardens next year.
College's proposal that overseas
PG's arriving for the first time in the
country should loose their
guaranteed place in hall seems
rather short sighted. Surely this
would lead to a smaller number of
Overseas PG's applying and hence
possibly to a reduction in revenue.
This is approximately £6000 per
student and would result in a vicious
spiral of diminishing returns.
The 10% increase in numbers will
lead to many timetabling problems.
Lectures may have to be relocated
on a college-wide basis, practicals,
which are tied to specific locations,
may become over-crowded and
equipment which in many cases may
already be inadequate will become
more so. Obviously an increase in
student numbers will exert a greater
stress on members of staff and
reduce staff-student contact.
Note also that if student numbers
increase by 10% IC Union will also
require an equivalent increase in
funds to cope with them.
Possible Solutions
The nature of these problems is
such that neither the Union nor
individual students can deal with
them . We feel that College should
take immediate action; firstly
College should appoint someone
specific to search for new
accommodation with the aim of
acquiring it for student residences.
Secondly diminished funds should
be replenished, in a manner that
does not necessitate such an
unmanageable increase in student
numbers.
