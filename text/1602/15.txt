Imperial Cinema report on this term’s cinematic treats
"Ava isn’t
quite what
she seems,
and maybe
Nathan
isn’t
either..."
The Imperial Cinema All-
Nighter returns, bringing
with it six films guaranteed to
thrill, inspire, provoke and entertain
in equal measure. From historical
drama to sci-fi thriller, musical to
surreal comedy, we’ve got it all lined
up and ready to go.
Selma - 18:00
First up comes Selma, the biopic of
Martin Luther King, Jr. that focuses
on much more than just the great
man himself. This is the story of
events in Selma, Montgomery in
1965, the scene of one of the most
famous marches for civil rights in
history.
The peaceful marchers are met with
brutal resistance, but they persevere,
with their bravery a continued source
of inspiration.
The film picked up an Oscar
for Best Original Song, but the
performances (and direction) are
among the strongest of the past year’s
crop of films.
Ex Machina - 21:00
Our second film is Alex Garland’s
directorial debut, and it’s an absolute
stunner of a first effort.
Dealing with themes of artificial
intelligence, consciousness, and
free will, Ex Machina tells the tale of
Caleb, a software engineer who wins a
competition to spend a week with his
recluse boss, the technological genius
Nathan.
When Caleb arrives at Nathan’s
retreat, he discovers the real
purpose of the competition: to find
a participant for a Turing Test with
Nathan’s pet project, an AI called Ava.
As the test starts, it appears that
Ava isn’t quite what she seems, and
maybe Nathan isn’t either…
Whiplash - 23:45
The third entry in this term’s All-
Nighter is the critical darling story
of Miles Teller’s young drummer,
who joins a studio band led by J.
K. Simmons’ brutally dictatorial
conductor.
Holding three Oscars (including
one for Best Supporting Actor for
Simmons), this is our most-garlanded
film on offer, and it’s an intense
experience that doesn’t let up until
the final drumbeat.
Into the Woods - 01:45
Relieving the intensity with a
musical, you say? Almost, but not
quite.
The film adaptation of Sondheim’s
Into the Woods sees the composer
extraordinaire turn his hands to fairy
tales, serving up a deliciously twisted
version of your childhood stories.
Happy ever after isn’t so far away,
but what comes next is where the fun
truly begins.
With an all-star, all singing, all
dancing cast, and Rob Marshall
(who directed the Oscar-winning
adapatation of Chicago) at the helm,
Into the Woods is a musical treat.
Paddington - 04:05
An entirely different style of big-
screen adaptation comes in this, the
silver screen re-telling of Michael
Bond’s children’s books.
Many years ago, a British explorer
in Peru comes across a family of
bears, who he rapidly develops a
bond with, teaching them the ways of
civilisation.
Years later, after a horrible tragedy,
a young bear makes the treacherous
journey to London, seeking a new
home. But London is not as friendly
as he had been told – at least, not
until he meets the Brown family.
The most heart-warming,
adorable film of the year marks the
penultimate step in our All-Nighter,
before:
"Right up
until the
part where
they’re all
immortal
vampires."

What We Do in the Shadows
-06:00
This kooky comedy deals with the
lives of three flatmates, who have to
deal with all of life’s usual struggles:
rent, chores, social lives, the squabbles
provoked by living together.
All in all, fairly standard, right up
to the part where they’re all immortal
vampires. What We Do in the Shadows
plays with the tropes of vampire
films as well as slice-of-life comedies,
providing one of the most side-
splittingly funny films in years that
hides an emotional (if slightly weird)
heart.
