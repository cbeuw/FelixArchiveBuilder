The women’s match, the headline

minutes of the match, but otherwise
they played a strong game.
Man of the match was Sam Moorby,
who scored two tries for the IC team.
The “MVP” for the women’s rugby
was Katherine Fok, who played for

Steven Basher previews tonight’s crunch game against UCL in Streatham
Varsity Preview: Ice Hockey plays tonight
Tonight, the Imperial Devils Ice
Hockey team take on the UCL
Yetis in the 3rd
annual “London
Ice Varsity”. The Devils will be eager
to retain their unbeaten record,
having triumphed two years in a row
so far.
Facing off at 20:00 at Streatham Ice
Arena, one of London’s great sporting
rivalries will be re-ignited in a fast-
paced and aggressive showdown.
Reigning champions, the Imperial
Devils, will be aiming to press home
their Varsity dominance and come
away with a 3rd
win in as many years,
whilst the UCL Yetis are looking to
get off the mark with a first Varsity
win.
Last year’s contest saw Imperial
take the crown in a nail biting
sudden-death penalty shootout.
Regular time saw the lead change
four times, before UCL equalised
within the last 10 minutes of the
game to send the game into overtime
at 4-4. The Devils managed to make it
through the extra period, only saved
by the goalpost. But when it came to
the crunch, Imperial stepped up to the
mark and goalkeeper Stefan Nubert
cemented his MVP status by denying
the ﬁnal Yeti penalty.
Without 3 goal hero Ryan Heaton
and winning penalty scorer Max Fink
to depend on this year, the Devils will
be looking to their ranks for a new
superstar to emerge and solidify their
position of dominance. Captain and
top point-scorer Gus Zimmerman
will be leading the team from defence,
aiming to deny entrance to any and
all Yetis.
In regular season games this year,
the Devils and Yetis are one win
apiece. Both contests were hotly
contested and the animosity between
the teams was rarely hidden. With
aggravator Ryan Ritchie once again
appearing on the Imperial roster, any
overflow in tempers could easily end
in another Yeti hitting the ice after
one punch.
The event promises to be another
spectacle this year, with an even
larger attendance. The Imperial
Angels figure skating club will be
making another appearance in the
pre-game show, demonstrating their
incredible talents. Music will be
provided by Imperial’s own Steve
Basher, filling up the gaps between
plays and adding to the sure-to-be
incredible atmosphere.
The Devils have a point to prove
and, with no love lost between the
teams, a strong motivation to upstage
the Yetis once again. This event is not
one to miss out on!
£5 tickets available from http://
