Giulia Gabrielli reviews season 4 of the tearjerking BBC show
Attenborough’s swan song
LifeStory takes us around the world to see an eclectic
collection of animal behaviours in the journey through
life on this planet. Quirky and fascinating scenes from
birth and growing up, through the struggle to create
a home and establish power, and finally mating and
passing genes on to the next generation. The latest BBC
nature show is perhaps not as remote, spectacular or
human-like as other previous Attenborough ventures.
But then it hits you: his swan song is not about majestic
time-lapse shots and peculiar behaviours, even though
it is filled with such moments.
When you see the tribulations of a young hermit
crab’s struggle to get into the property ladder, a lonely
octopus looking for protection, or the exquisite and
hypnotising sand-sculpture a Japanese puffer-fish
builds in order to attract a lady you suddenly realise
that the human struggle for survival and existence is
neither more nor less meaningful than that of any other
species.
I had my epiphany yesterday as I watched two
albatrosses re-encounter after a year apart while flying
around the world. Are the bonds we have with our kin
more significant than theirs?
Is our impossible search for an affordable semi-
detached three-bedroom house in London’s zone 3 as
unnerving as Mr. Crabby’s competitive housing chain?
Or do we selfishly put ourselves at the centre of this
universe so we can fill the void the acknowledgement of
the insignificance of our existence leaves behind?
Only when we, as a species, stop trying to find some
special meaning to our being can we finally embrace our
position as part of nature, protect it and revel in awe at
its magnificence and our ability to perceive it.

"The vibes
change
from the
austerity
of the
50s to the
colours of
the 60s."
In four years I have never
watched an episode of Call the
Midwife without crying. And I
never cry. There’s just something
about the tragic and sweet stories of
post-war London that fills me with
warmth and makes me want to call
my granny.
I was sceptical after the departure
of Nurse Jenny Lee, narrator and
main character, that the writers
were going to be able to maintain
a strong plotline following the loss
of Poplar’s most beloved midwife.
After all, the series was based on
Jennifer Worth’s (real-life Jenny
Lee) own memoirs.
But BBC proved me wrong, as it so
often does. Replacing the romance
and gossip of Worth’s characters
with serious themes and stories
taken from historical testimonies
The deeper, darker content is
definitely appreciated, and feels
like a spontaneous development as
the vibe changes from the austerity
of the 50s to the colour and
innovation of the 60s.
Although, one thing still bugs
me: why is elderly Nurse Lee still
narrating the stories since she is
not in them anymore? I guess the
production wants to keep showing
Vanessa Redgrave’s name of the
screen to gain golden stars.
Nevertheless, the joint effort is
still impressive, and some of the
character developments showed
by the secondary characters really
show what a great cast was chosen
for this show.
Of the original cast, Miranda
Hart’s character, Chummie, is seen
as a more mature and motherly
figure. Having grown out of her
silly and clumsy character she
is now a competent nurse with a
loving husband and chubby baby.
When asked to take over a mother-
and-child home she rises to the
challenge, finally proving her
worth for good.
Nurse Cynthia, who always
seemed more quite and poised, is
now seen going through a spiritual
crisis. This leads her to join the
order as a nun, something which
profoundly changes the other girls.
Patsy, a relatively new character,
develops a strong friendship with
another female nurse. Quickly the
viewer perceives that the friendship
has developed into a romantic
relationship, the first mention of
homosexuality in Nonnatus house.
But maybe the biggest shock of
the season is the development of
Helen George’s character, Nurse
Trixie. When we left Trixie, she was
the blond and superficial girl of the
group. Always up for a gossip over
a shiny magazine, she was about to
marry the man of her dreams: blue-
eyed Reverend Tom Hereward.
In this series, we see Trixie
finding herself while exploring
her dark past. After the grave
realisation that she, as her abusive
father, is an alcoholic, she takes
the bold decision of annulling her
engagement in order to work on her
problems.
The show focus on her role as
part of the Nonnatus midwives,
more marginal but still key to
the dynamics of the group, shows
great performances from all cast
members, forced to show empathy
and anger for Trixie. In particular,
it is refreshing to see her changing
relationship with Cynthia after her
decision to become a nun.
New additions to the cast
include Linda Bassett, who plays
Nurse Crane, an unmarried
illegitimate child who tries to fit
in and Charlotte Ritchie, from the
university student series Fresh Meat.
The most important part of
the show though, are the women
giving birth episode after episode.
They tell stories of overbearing
parents, violent husbands, poverty,
prostitution, immigration and
discrimination.
Call the Midwife, once a curious
tale of what England used to be
after the difficulties of the war, has
morphed into a cutting portrayal
of the changes faced by London’s
society in the 1960s.
If once, it was the tragedy of the
nurses’ personal relationships
that made me pull out the tissues,
now it is the battle of the traveller
community to fit into Poplar, the
struggle of a lesbian couple to spend
the rest of their lives together or the
torments of alcoholism.
Something that has not changed
though, is the intimacy and
subtlety of the writing, which
continue to make this show a
brilliant watch.
