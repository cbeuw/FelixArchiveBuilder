Facing difficult decisions in medicine
During some pregnancies,
abnormal blood flow from
the placenta can deprive
the foetus of sufficient oxygen and
nutrients to grow to its full potential.
This condition is known as foetal
growth restriction and affects up
to 8% of all pregnancies, a total of
60,000 babies per year in Europe
and the USA. The condition is
associated with an increased risk of
stillborn birth, neonatal death and
neurological and cardiovascular
disorders later in life. When
diagnosed, doctors sometimes decide
to deliver these babies early, before
the lack of oxygen and increased
acidity becomes too damaging.
However, this can be a tricky decision
to make and involves balancing
the risks of keeping the baby in
a poor womb environment with
the increased risk of morta that’s
associated with premature births.
Currently, there is no consensus
for when to trigger the delivery
in mothers of babies with foetal
growth restriction and no best
form of monitoring to inform this
decision. The Trial of Randomised
Umbilical and Foetal Flow in Europe
(TRUFFLE) aimed to help clarify this
decision by investigating which of
the current monitoring methods are
most effective in reducing pre and
post-natal problems associated with
foetal growth restriction.
Women at 26-32 weeks into
pregnancy who had been diagnosed
with foetal growth restriction were
randomly allocated to one of three
different monitoring methods
currently used in obstetrics. either:
Cardiotocography - this is the
most commonly used method of
foetal surveillance and monitors the
variation in the foetal heart rate.
Early ductus venosus changes
- this uses ultrasound to monitor
the resistance in blood flow within
the ductus venosus, a small vessel
below the fetus’ heart, and gives an
indication of oxygen shortage.
Late ductus venosus changes - this
also uses ultrasound to monitor
variability in the waveform of the
blood flow in the ductus venosus and
indicates abnormalities in the foetus’
heart contractions.
The decision on when to deliver
the baby was based on the output of
the monitoring technique allocated.
They then recorded the rate of
survival both before and after birth
and followed the surviving babies
for two years after to determine
how many developed neurological
disorders such as cerebral palsy or
neurosensory impairment. They also
carried out a cognitive assessment
with a standardised scale of infant
development known as the Bayley
III score, with a score of less than
85 suggestive of problems with
neurodevelopment.
Lead author Christoph Lees, from
the Department of Surgery and
Cancer at Imperial College London,
commented about the study, “It is the
first prospective randomised study
to compare different monitoring
and management strategies in fetal
growth restriction. Fetal growth
restriction is a major problem in
perinatal medicine and also a major
cause of neonatal morbidity with
babies spending many weeks or
months on neonatal units”.
The findings of the study, carried
out across 20 European specialist
centres, indicated that the late
ductus venosus changes monitoring
technique was three times more
effective in reducing the chances
of neurodevelopmental problems
two years after birth. Of all babies
Lauren Ratcliffe reports on a trail revealing the most
effective pre-natal monitoring technique
that survived 95% of those that were
delivered based on the late ductus
venosus changes did not encounter
neurodevelopmental problems.
Whereas 85% of babies delivered
according to cardiotocography did
and 91% of those monitored on the
basis of early ductus venosus changes.
However, there were no significant
differences in neonatal survival rates
between the different monitoring
techniques.
“It was a complex monitoring
protocol, which is difficult to put
into action throughout centres
in many different countries. But
what was good is that so many
centres embraced the study so
enthusiastically. Also, the study was
largely non-funded, which is difficult
to do in today’s environment,” said
Dr Lees, when I asked about any
challenges him and his team had
faced.
There are current no effective
treatments for pregnant women
diagnosed with fetal growth
restriction. “We are working on
potential pharmaco-therapies that
involve vasodilation and improving
placental circulation,” Dr Lees
elucidates. However, what was clear
from the study is that the outlook in
early onset growth restriction is much
better than previously imagined,
whatever monitoring strategy is
followed
“This type of research isn’t a quick
fix and requires years of hard work.
The idea started off in a bar in a hotel
in Turin with professors Gerry Visser
and Tullia Todros in 2001 and rapidly
became an international group effort.
I have co-ordinated all the meetings-
it’s been hard work but great fun and
I am enormously indebted to my
collaborators many of whom have
become very good friends. And of
course to the women who took part:
we have at least in part with their help
at a very sensitive time answered a
question that many thought we could
never answer,” Dr Lees explains.
The researchers are planning
on the ‘TRUFFLE 2’ study on
women diagnosed with foetal
growth restriction at a later time
in pregnancy (32 to 36 weeds). Dr
Lees will also be writing a textbook
on foetal growth restriction with
the TRUFFLE authors. The trial
was published in The Lancet the
5th
March. DOI:10.1016/S0140-

Does parliament need more scientists?
Robert Winston was made a Labour peer in 1995 and has been instrumental in getting many key science and healthcare bills through parliament.

James Bezer talks to Lord Winston about his experience in politics
"All three
party
leaders
have had
very little
experience
of the real
world."
"How do
you become
objective
when
you feel
subjectively
outraged?."
The impact of science has
never been confined to the
laboratory. Today, many of
the most important and difficult
decisions faced by politicians are
fundamentally scientific, from
the best way to tackle climate
change to the recent vote to allow
mitochondrial replacement therapy.
Robert Winston, Professor of
Science and Society at Imperial, has
had a key role in many of the biggest
science policy decisions made by
parliament in the 20 years he’s been
a Member of the House of Lords. He
was voted “Peer of the Year” by his
fellow parliamentarians in 2008 for
his work on the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology bill. He recently
spoke to Felix about the role of
scientists in politics.
“The trouble with the House of
Commons” says Winston, “is that
more and more people are going in
immediately after leaving University
with the idea that they’re going to
be party leader in 10 years time,
and they come in without any
background. If you look at the party
leaders, all three of them have had
very little experience of the real
world. Nick Clegg has had some
slight experience, but the other
two haven’t ever done a proper job,
really, it’s always been political,
and I don’t think that’s good for
parliament. There are a few doctors
in parliament—Sarah Woolaston, for
example, is a very good doctor—but
we could do with more.”
The number of MPs with a
scientific background is truly dire.
Of the 649 MPs, only one has been a
practicing scientist: Julian Huppert,
a biochemist and MP for Cambridge.
Just two others have science PhDs,
and of the 90% with university
degrees, only 54 hold theirs in
any type of science, technology or
medicine. This compares to 84 MPs
who are former lawyers.
The House of Lords, however,
remains one of the only legislative
bodies in the world where a huge
amount of scientific expertise can
be found. Despite the perennial
attacks on the chamber as being
undemocratic and anachronistic, and
repeated failed attempts to replace it
with an elected body, Lord Winston
was keen to defend the valuable role,
particularly in scientific matters,
that its members can play.
“The House of Lords is full of
scientists, and if you look round the
House, there are a large number of
us who are Fellows of at least two out
of the three scientific academies,
a surprising number, who are
Fellows of the Royal Academy of
Engineering, Fellows of the Royal
Society, Fellows of the Academy of
Medical Sciences, and often many
of us are Fellows of more than one
of those institutions. That’s why
debates on science in the House of
Lords are well thought of, and are
models for other parliaments to
follow.
“In the Commons, MPs can’t use
their expertise, as the way parliament
is structured means that can’t really
vote with any scientific expertise you
might have as you have to vote with
your side. In the House of Lords, we
don’t take any notice of the whips and
they accept that and appreciate that.”]
“In the House of Lords, there’s
a feeling that you’re going to vote
rationally, and I think that’s why the
chamber should not be too rapidly
reassembled, as it has some strengths
which are quite important.”
Winston is proud of the
contribution he and other prominent
scientists have made in the Lords. He
is Vice-chair of the Parliamentary
Office for Science and Technology
and has advised ministers on science
and medical policy.
“I think most people feel that I
certainly helped Tony Blair to come
to the decision to increase funding for
the health service very dramatically
in 2000, and I’m not alone in that.
Ara Darzi (Professor of surgery at
Imperial) has been a tremendously
influential member of the House
of Lords. He became a minister for
while and really fundamentally laid
down some very important things,
so I think individual members of
the House of Lords can have colossal
influence in doing something that
is really using their expertise. Of
course, you’d never get someone like
Ara Darzi in the lower chamber.”
“Ron Oxburgh as well, one of
our former Rectors, has been
tremendously influential in energy
policy and renewables and how we
should use fossil fuels.”
Many of the decisions Robert
Winston has made in politics have
been influenced by his experiences
treating patients. How does he
reconcile this with the need to remain
objective and open-minded when
making decisions that could affect
everyone in the country? Are there
instances where the arts graduates
who usually run the country could be
better placed to make decisions about
scientific issues?
“Ultimately any individual
clinician has the major responsibility
to do the best for their patients, and
of course if you were my patient, you
would expect that.”
“Sometimes you realise that
keeping this patient alive is probably
quite difficult to justify, when for
the same expense you could probably
treat 30-40 other people, so I think
that’s always an issue.”
“I suppose in my case you could
level your finger at me and say
‘you’ve been treating patients
with infertility, which isn’t a life-
threatening condition’, but of course
it causes massive disruption, and the
pain of infertility is every bit as bad
as the pain of an osteoarthritic hip,
and you wouldn’t think twice about
treating that.”
“So how do you become objective
as a parliamentarian when you
feel quite subjectively outraged?
That outrage is sometimes useful,
sometimes you need to stand up and
say this is outrageous, as we did with
the health reform act in 2012, and I
think the only fault we had there was
not saying it loud enough.”
“I think we should have said more
firmly that this is a very bad piece of
legislation, which now, of course, the
government admits, but only once
the damage has already been done.”
“I’m not a great thinker, but I
think the strength I may have in
parliament is the ability to give
passionate speeches on things I feel
deeply about, and I think that’s quite
important in politics.”
