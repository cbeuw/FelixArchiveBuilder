Campaigning is hard work...
Let’s get one thing out of the
way first: yes, I did just lose
in the Big Elections. Yes, I am
extremely bitter about this. Yes, you
can read the whole article as just a
sore loser whining about losing sorely
if you want.
That said I do have some things to
say about the whole ordeal.
The summary, really, is that I feel
massively burned by this whole thing.
I invested a lot of my self-worth, and
a lot of time in this campaign, and
losing has hit me on a deeply personal
level. I’ve wanted to run for DPCS for
a year now. I wrote my manifesto at
Christmas. I started the poster and
flyer designs a month in advance.
And then, when we were officially
allowed to start campaigning, I
spent almost every minute of almost
every day out on campus talking to
people, handing out flyers, putting
up posters, doing lecture shout-outs
to pretty much every year group in
every department… all the stuff they
tell you to do to win an election.
I caught a horrible flu bug on the
first Thursday, but came in on Friday
anyway to keep campaigning. To
campaign properly and get the best
shot at winning, one needs to put
one’s degree and life on hold for two
weeks, and you can still lose.
There’s no party politics here –
every vote is up for grabs, every ‘seat’
is a swing seat. You probably have a
couple of hundred assured votes from
your mates and ‘factions’ such as
societies – the other 3,500 votes (the
rough number who made a vote for
DPCS) are totally up for grabs.
Is it at all possible to convince
enough of these people to vote
for you to make it actually worth
campaigning? A few years ago a
candidate for Union President won
over 2,000 votes and still lost.
How can we be expected to reach
out to all those thousands of people,
when everyone knows that the
only sure-fire way to get a vote is to
actually go out and talk to the person?
Just making it rain flyers isn’t good
enough. Just putting your face on a
poster isn’t good enough.
I genuinely believe based on
my experiences in this election,
based on everything I’ve learned,
that campaigning, in its entirety,
is pointless. Ben and I were very
similar candidates – similar levels of
Union experience, similar manifesto
points, very similar ideologies… How
can there be a meaningful political
discourse between two candidates
with such little separating them?
I personally think that the number
of voters whose opinions were
swayed by any of our campaigning
was far smaller than the number of
people who ‘entered the booth’ either
knowing they were going to vote for
their mate, or not having interacted
at all with any candidate. That latter
group presumably had nothing but
the pictures and manifestos to go on
when making their choice.
So what’s the alternative? I’m not
here to suggest one. The current
system burned me badly. But
maybe it really is the best of a lot of
compromises.
Would I run for a sabbatical role
again if I had the chance? Probably
not; in my opinion it is not worth
the time and effort those two weeks
require to campaign, even if you do
win.
... but there is a witty rejoinder
I’m not going to come out spewing
rainbows and say that campaigning
was the most fun I’d had all year. It’s a
stressful experience, and one that you
need to prepare yourself for.
I was very lucky; I had a strong
campaign team, and a number of
people I could whine at when it all got
a bit much. I also enjoyed the chats
I had about my plans, and Union
stuff that people actually care about.
I learnt how a campaign works, and
also some of what this year’s Sabb
team are going to have to focus on.
The experience of campaigning is
necessary to do the job. Sabbaticals
shouldn’t necessarily be the most
technically competent person – that’s
what staff are for – but they should
be the most relatable person to the
student body.
Tom claims that convincing
someone to vote for you is “totally
pointless”. If you can’t convince
people to get behind you though, how
are you going to be the most relatable
person to that same student body?
I have a huge amount of respect for
how hard people campaigned, and
the commitment of other candidates
in this year’s elections intimidates
me to some extent. But some of them
missed the point.
What I think this election has
made clear is that there needs to be
a dialogue about candidates’ welfare
during elections fortnight. With all
the bright, colourful posters all over
campus, it’s easy to forget the possible
effects on the rest of your life.
The Returning Officer briefed us all
on the first Monday of campaigning,
and he made a point that the struggle
with student elections is not to get
people to vote for you, but to got
them to vote at all. It’s also not until
this meeting that you hear the words
“more than half of you are going to
lose,” and I think this doesn’t hit
home with people until it is too late,
and they have already committed to
standing in the election.
I agree with Tom when he says that
a large majority of voters weren’t
involved in the election and didn’t
interact with those campaigning.
People log on, look at the pictures,
maybe read a manifesto or two, and
cast their vote. And immediately
forget about it. However, even if the
voters may not be the most invested
in the campaigns, the candidates are;
elections can take over their lives for
two weeks and require considerable
emotional commitment.
The Union has a ‘Campaigns
Co-ordinator’ and four other staff
members directly involved with HR,
student development and general
welfare. Why can’t some time be
allowed to debrief some of the
candidates in person, rather than
an impersonal 1-5 scale of how you
think it went, like the survey that
candidates are asked to fill out after
the elections are over?
I will say that you should definitely
consider running for a Sabbatical
in next year’s Big Elections. Not all
elements of campaigning are for
everyone, but you can make it work to
your strengths; and if you do, it’s fun.
And if you don’t win, remember
it’s not the end of all things. After all,
there is definitely more to life than
Imperial College Union.

Campaigning
ain’t all bad!
This year seems to have
seen an unfortunate turn to
the negative with a lot of the
campaigning that’s been going
on–particularly it seems to
have been less enjoyed by the
candidates and it’s such a shame.
I absolutely loved campaigning;
it was two of the greatest weeks
I’ve ever experienced.I loved
talking about how much I loved
the Union and wanted to be
involved in it full time,spending
two weeks talking about how
amazing our clubs are and the
incredible things they do was
something I couldn’t get enough
of.
Sure it was completely and
utterly exhausting: I got ill,I
got stressed,I lost a lot of my
faith in my ability to actually do
the job,but I also got to spend
two weeks being completely
encouraged by all the support
from my friends and family.It’s
an incredible position to be in
to get to experience weeks of
friends wandering round with
your face on their shirt,and
telling other people why you’re
great.There’s very few other
situations where you can get
away with making your friends
tell you you’re awesome for two
weeks straight,and if you’re even
a little narcissistic,you should
totally run for a role just because
of that.
Wandering round the JCR
with bags of sweets; chatting to
random strangers wherever I ran
into them; and doing shout-outs
in what I think was over thirty
lectures was exhausting but so
cool.Telling people what it was
that the Union did,explaining
why I wanted to get involved,
what it is I would actually be
doing,and then why they should
vote for me to be the one doing
that meant that I got to spend
a lot of time being challenged
on my motives and actually
convincing people that I was
the right person for it.Taking a
random stranger from a‘who is
this crazy person talking to me,
what is the Union,what are they
talking about?’ to‘oh maybe
I’ll vote in these elections,and
maybe I’ll vote for her’was a
really exciting experience.
Genuinely,the passion that
people show off during election
season is incredible to watch,
and seeing the amount that
some people really care about
what goes on here is one of the
greatest things about being
involved in the Big elections.
