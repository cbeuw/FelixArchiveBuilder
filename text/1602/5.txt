Newly discovered valley channels
warm water to melt Antarctic glacier
Scientists from Imperial College
London have revealed that the
melting and thinning of Totten
Glacier in East Antarctica is being
accelerated by a valley underneath
the ice shelf channelling warm water
to the base of the glacier.
The research was published this
week in Nature Geoscience after a
collaboration with institutions in the
US, Australia and France. Satellite
data had previously showed that the
Totten Glacier has been thinning
significantly.
Described as East Antarctica’s most
rapidly changing glacier, the ice shelf
is around 150 kilometres long by 30
kilometres wide. It is a major outlet
for the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the
largest mass of ice on Earth, which
covers 98% of the continent.
It was previously believed to be
relatively stable compared to the
smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
which loses more than 150 cubic
kilometres of ice every year.
Surveying the area with radar
and other geophysical techniques,
the team of researchers generated a
map of the topographical landscape
underlying the glacier.
Instead of the cooler waters
previously thought to surround the
East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the data
revealed a 5 kilometre wide valley
running underneath the glacier,
which exposes the base of the ice to
warm ocean water.
This intrusion of warmer water is
accelerating the thinning of the ice
shelf. While the thin ice at the edges
of ice sheets can float on the ocean,
inland ice is ‘grounded’ and in contact
with the bedrock.
The newly discovered valley exposes
the grounded edge of the ice sheet to
warm water, leading to significant
melting of the glacier. With climate
change raising the temperature of
the oceans, sea levels are predicted to
rise at a rate of around one metre per
century.
Totten Glacier could represent a
major component of this rise, with
enough ice draining from the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet to raise global sea
levels by 3.5 metres.
Any destabilisation of the Totten
Glacier could leave more of the
inland ice vulnerable to change, said
Professor Martin Siegert, Co-Director
of the Grantham Institute at Imperial
College London and a co-author of
the study.
“Once a certain region starts
to change, the implications for
the connected ice are potentially
significant.
“We are using computer modelling
to understand whether changes in
Totten Glacier could lead to changes
in both adjacent and more distant
places in Antarctica.
“The change at Totten Glacier itself
is significant and concerning. It’s
only one glacier, but it’s changing
now and it is significant for sea levels
globally. The 3.5 metre rise may take
several centuries to complete, but
now the process has started it is likely
irreversible.
“This is another example of how
human-induced climate change
could be triggering major changes
with knock-on impacts that will be
felt globally”. Professor Siegert and
his colleagues are planning to map
more regions of the Antarctic ice to
further understand the dynamics of
the continent.

Highest ever voter
turnout as Big Elections
come to a close
Last Friday saw the end of
another year of campaigning
and voting for the Imperial
College Union sabbatical positions,
with the results of the Big Elections
2015 announced during the results
party in Metric.
The election, which also featured
the Liberation Officers, Constituent
Union positions and a large number
of clubs and societies positions, once
again resulted in the Union taking
the largest turnout in England and
Wales; once again The University
of St. Andrews in Scotland took the
crown for the largest turnout in the
UK. The number of postgraduate
students voting was also up 50% on
last year.
The total number of voters was also
up on last year, by nearly 750, with
the rate of people voting being on the
whole much greater than the year
before.
Next year’s President will be
Lucinda Sandon-Allum, who got
3152 votes, while Luke Armitage took
1016 and RON 552. The Returning
Officers told attendees at the party
that this was the highest number of
votes received by a Union President
candidate in the history of the Union.
Lucinda told Felix about the elections,
“I am absolutely thrilled to have
been elected as Union President! A
huge thank you to my phenomenal
campaign team who played a massive
part in making this happen and an
equally big thank you to everyone
who voted for me.
“The last two weeks of campaigning
have been a great opportunity to
talk to so many different groups of
students from all areas of the College.
I am very excited to start putting my
manifesto points into action next
year and bettering the student voice
and experience”.
The Deputy Presidents were
Ben Howitt for Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), Chun-Yin San
for Deputy President (Education),
and Christopher Kaye for Deputy
President (Finance and Services).
Cyin San said, “A huge thank
you to everyone who voted – very
proud to have been part of such a
large democratic vote. Particular
thank you to my BMS students,
whose engagement in Rep affairs
over the past year have been hugely
motivational, and to those of you who
followed my online campaigns - I
hope you’ve enjoyed learning random
facts each day!
“I look forward to serving all
Imperial students over the next year
as your top Academic Rep, and to
work constructively with College to
improve your learning experience”.
Finally, Jennifer Watson will
be next year’s Deputy President
(Welfare), saying, “I’m so
unbelievably happy and extremely
grateful to everyone who voted for
me. I can’t wait to get stuck in to work
now!”.
Ben told Felix, “Thanks so much
for electing me as your DPCS for
next year! It was a great experience
to campaign, and I feel especially
lucky that I was campaigning for a
contested position. Lots to work from
there!
“There’s so much going on next year
– it’s hard to pick a favourite. The aim
next term is to get organised and get
talking to people, so that we go out of
this year ready to start the next”.
Chris told us, “I’m very excited
about being able to implement some
changes very quickly. Alex, the
incumbent DPFS, is very keen to help
me get the groundwork sorted for my
year’s start, and I’m very grateful to
him for that.
“The sabbatical team this year have
been fantastic, have had a superb
dynamic together, and I feel I’ve
made some friends for life. Next
year’s sabbatical team have big shoes
to fill, but we relish the challenge.
“To paraphrase the Queen, I look
forward to continuing to serve our
great Imperial family to which we all
belong”.
Meanwhile Grace Rahman will
be next year’s Felix Editor, and the
student trustees will be Zain Rizvi
and Serena Yuen, who dramatically
moved from second to first place in
the final round of voting.
The Live Statistics dashboard made
its return once again, with Faculty of
Engineering this year beating Natural
Sciences to be the top faculty in terms
of turnout. Electrical Engineering
had the greatest turnout amongst
departments, and two clubs had 100%
turnout, Croquet and RSM Netball.
