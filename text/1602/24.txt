Play Mas fails to live up to its promise
The joy of carnival is infectious.
Dressing up, getting drunk and
parading around town to the
sound of steel drums: what could be
better? Every culture has a different
spin on carnival, but few know how
to do it better than the Trinidadians’
annual Play Mas.
Written in 1974 by the Trinidadian
playwright Mustapha Matura, once
referred to as “the most perceptive
and humane of black dramatists
writing in Britain”, Play Mas is a
sharp, witty and at times beautifully
poignant script illustrating a touching
picture of Trinidadian culture.
Focussing on the years leading up
to Trinidad’s independence and the
spirit of carnival, this revival might
not be as relevant now as it was forty
years ago, but it still hits home with
its questions on political power and
national identity. Despite this, with
the direction of Paulette Randall
leaving a lot to be desired, my pick
for March was little more than a luke-
warm laugh.
Set in Miss Gookool’s tailor shop,
the first act details the relationship
between her, her son Ramjohn and
their assistant Samuel. Exploring
aspiration and inspiration, the sharp
dialogue characterises the warmth of
Trinidadian culture and touches on
the ideas which led to independence
from the British. While little is done
to directly develop a plot, the play’s
distinct focus on the importance
of carnival draws a parallel to the
powerful undertone of identity.
The performance of Johann Myers
as Ramjohn is exceptional. Subtle
and enticing, Myers’ dedication
to his character and striking focus
heightens both the drama and the
comedy of the piece. With the core
cast completed by Melanie La Barrie
as Miss Gookool and Seun Shote as
Samuel, their performances bring
the most out of Matura’s wildly
entertaining dialogue. Unfortunately,
the supporting cast fail to live up to
their counterparts.
From what feels like misguided
direction, the supporting cast’s
desperation in trying to squeeze
another laugh out of the audience
sidelines the deeply serious
undertone of the play. Added to Rob
Heanley’s irritatingly bad attempt
at an American accent, Randall’s
production comes across as farcical.
It’s certainly funny, but as a complete
play it doesn’t work.

Will the real Wellington please stand up?
The aim of the National
Portrait Gallery’s latest
collection is, explains the
curator, to “put Wellington’s great
reputation back on the map”. This
somehow implies that it ever went
away. The Duke of Wellington is such
a well known figure, carved both on
the national consciousness and on
numerous memorials, that it makes
such an exhibition – Wellington:
Triumphs, Politics, and Passions –
somewhat redundant. Unless, that
is, they can stage an exhibition that
allows us to look at the Duke in a new
light.
Sadly, the National Portrait Gallery
doesn’t manage this; instead, what
we get are the same pictures we are
used to again and again. Marking out
his life through a series of portraits,
Wellington stares down at us in
regalia in an early John Hoppner,
pensively gazes from a Goya, and
considers his surroundings in a
study by Sir Thomas Lawrence.
These portraits are interspersed with
other artefacts, such as metalware
emblazoned with his face, and plates
painted with the battle of Waterloo –
camp artefacts of high kitsch.
Some things in the exhibition
do stand out; the diary of Edmund
Wheatley, for example, made during
the Peninsular War, in which he
sets descriptions of his everyday
life with exquisite watercolours, is a
highlight. Elsewhere, a painting by
James Ward, entitled The Triumph
of Arthur, shows Wellington as a
near-angel, surrounded by golden
mythical figures. It is overblown,
gaudy, horrific, tacky, and utterly
marvellous. If only there were more
like it in the exhibition, rather than
the status quo images we are so used to
consuming.
Ultimately, the main problem
with the exhibition is simply that
it doesn’t give us a proper insight
into what Wellington was like as a
man. It comes close to this when, in
the later sections, we find out about
his close friendships, and see how
he was satirised by the newspapers
of the day. Ultimately, it would be
great to have more things like this,
that would allow us to see what the
man was like behind the image. This
would truly allow us to get a measure
of Wellington, not as an icon, but as a
man instead. If the National Portrait
Gallery had chosen to do this, then
perhaps the show would have been
more interesteing, but ultimately all
we have are a collection of portraits,
from which Wellington stares out,
with cold, unblinking eyes.
Wellington: Triumphs, Politics, and
Passions is on at the National Portrait
Gallery until 7th March. Entrance free.
Swan Lake 30 years on: still magical?

Fred Fyles finds ROH’s ballet in need of updating despite strong dancing
They say that familiarity breeds
contempt; if this is true, it
would be surprising to find
anyone in the country who can still
stand Swan Lake, a ballet classic that
has become so well known that it
risks becoming dusty. However, this
is clearly not the case, judging by the
turnout for the Royal Opera House’s
production, which filled the hall
right up to the rafters. A revival of
Anthony Dowell’s 1987 production,
this version of Swan Lake aims to
place the choreography firmly back
at the centre of the work; rather than
trying any fancy staging techniques,
or technical gimmicks, the piece
returns to London on the strength of
the Royal Ballet Company’s dancers.
On the whole, the production
stands up well, despite being nearly
30 years old; while this may not seem
like a long time when one considers
that Swan Lake has been repeatedly
reinterpreted for the last century,
in actual fact it can be difficult to
produce a ballet that truly stands
the test of time. In this version,
the longevity is guaranteed by the
excellent choreography, based upon
the 1895 version by Marius Petipa
and Lev Ivanov; the movements
are tight and organised, the dancers
clearly drilled like an army platoon,
but there is a generosity in the
movements, and a light grace that
belies the hours of sweat that goes
into such a performance.
The dual role of Odette/Odile, one
of those characters who has gone
down in ballet history for the sheer
difficulty of interpretation, is filled
by Natalia Osipova, principle of the
Royal Ballet. Osipova is good in the
role, particularly when filling the part
of Odette, the White Swan, conveying
an emotional vulnerability whilst
never letting the human side of the
character get consumed. While it
can be easy for a dancer to play up to
the swan role, all quivering legs and
shaking arms, Osipova imbues her
character with womanliness, meaning
that Prince Siegfried’s (Matthew
Golding) obsession with Odette comes
across as romantic, as opposed to
some form of strange bestiality.
The chemistry between Osipova
and Golding is apparent from
their first encounter, making their
partnership on stage something really
special. The relationship between the
principal dancers is what can make
or break a version of Swan Lake, and
in this production the two leads have
a strong base upon which the rest of
the piece is built. Golding also imbues
his Prince with a sense of muscular
physicality, meaning Siegfried’s
movements have a character all of
their own, as opposed to simply being

wonders for a show as easily as it can
break a show. Although the staging
doesn’t fail the space completely, a
degree of poor blocking leaves parts
of the audience wondering why they
are only seeing certain actors from
behind.
While the problem isn’t
particularly pervasive, the oddly long
scene changes make the production
feel distinctly disjointed. It is a
shame really because the script offers
an excitingly upbeat tempo, but
too often little details are pushed
too far at the expense of the play’s
clarity. With a little more focus on
the serious moments and a little
less forcefulness with the comedy, I
imagine this revival’s shortcomings
could have been easily resolved.
Despite its faults, Play Mas still
offers an impressive two hours of
entertainment. With Samuel rising to
political power in the second half, it is
refreshing to think that occasionally
even politics can be funny. With
black theatre so underrepresented,
Randall does throw in a few moments
of genius, giving The Orange Tree’s
distinctly middle-class audience an
enjoyable snapshot of Caribbean
culture. Overall though, Play Mas
wasn’t quite what it was made out to
be.
Play Mas is on at the Orange Tree
Theatre until 11th
April. Tickets from
£10
"The real
magic
happens
when the
focus is
directed
towards the
corps de
ballet”
a backdrop for the main action.
Unfortunately, Osipova is not
as good as the Black Swan, lacking
the required sensuality needed to
bring the role to life. The diametric
opposite of Odette, playing Odile,
the daughter of evil sorcerer Von
Rothbart (played by Gary Avis, all
feathers and moult), requires the
dancer to be able to reverse their
initial approach – confident where
Odette was fragile, red-hot where the
White Swan is icy. Osipova is clearly
more confident when playing the
Black Swan, but her attempts to be
seductive sadly fall flat.
The real magic, however, happens
when the focus is taken off the
main dancers, and instead directed
towards the corps de ballet, who form
the backbone of the production. The
group in Swan Lake are magnificent
– well drilled, with their en pointe
on point. A case in point, the ‘Danse
des petits cygnes’, in which four of
the dancers link hands and perform
a series of increasingly complex
moves, is perfectly done, with the
swans appearing to glide across ice.
In other scenes, they hold their poise
well, but it is the swan scenes where
the dynamics of the cast really sing
out, and the women seem to be nearly
turning into swans before our eyes.
Sadly, while the choreography is
a high point, other aspects have not
fared well. The staging veers between
simple minimalism and complex
gothic piles, with the former being
much more engaging to the audience;
in the lake scenes, all that is present
is an icy backdrop, shrouded in
mist, while in the ballroom scenes,
it appears that designer Yolanda
Sonnabend has ransacked the Palace
of Versailles, bringing with her a
superfluity of chintz. These sets,
along with some of the costumes
reveal the production’s true age, and
seem to drag behind the slick moves
of the dancers.
At this point, I feel that I should
admit that I didn’t actually see
this production in the Royal Opera
House’s cavernous main ampitheatre,
but rather in a central London
cinema, as part of ROH Live, in
which the company broadcasts a
live screening of the performance
across the country. While this
is undoubtedly a good means of
ensuring that everyone who wants
can share in the magic of ballet, from
Skegness to Slough, there are certain
elements that make it somewhat
more challenging from actually
seeing it live; there’s a different
atmosphere, of course, not seeing
the dancers in the flesh; but also,
the location of the microphones
means that the dancers’ footsteps are
emalified to such an extent that – at
times – they rise above the orchesta’s
beautiful music
I have no doubt that this version of
Swan Lake will be a ‘classic’ of ballet,
with its bold, generous choreography,
and only needs a great pairing – such
as we have here – to propel it into
greatness. Although Osipova has
problems with the dual role, the
chemistry between her and McRae
more than makes up for this. With a
thirty year history, this production
seems to have fared well so far, but
how long will it be before it really
beings to feel tired? – if the sets
and costumes are not updated and
trimmed down, this day may come
sooner than you think.
Swan Lake is on at the Royal Opera
House until 9th
April 2015. Tickets
are available online; for sold out
performances, day tickets will also be
available.
Swan Lake is being broadcast to
cinemas across the country as part
of ROH Live. The next screening
will be on 22nd
March, for which the
participating cinemas will be running
a Student Standby scheme, allowing
those with valid student ID to
purchase two tickets for £10. Visit the
ROH website for more details.
