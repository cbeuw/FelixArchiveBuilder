Cecily Johnson reports on the amazing fundraising achievement
£25,000 raised by Imperial College
PhD student for cyclone-hit Vanuatu
APhD student of the
Department of Chemistry
has raised more than £13,000
since Sunday 15th
March for relief
efforts in the cyclone-hit island
nation Vanuatu, after previously
raising £12,000 to build a library for a
school on one of the remote islands.
The Republic of Vanuatu is an
archipelago in the South Pacific
Ocean. A state of emergency was
declared in the country last Thursday
11th
March after the region was
devastated by Cyclone Pam in
possibly the greatest natural disaster
in the nation’s history.
Rachel Brooks, a 27 year old PhD
candidate at Imperial, raised £13,000
in donations in less than a week for
the islands of Tanbok and Pentecost
whilst still recovering from surgery
on her arm.
She first founded the Tanbok
Project in 2007 after spending a gap
year teaching maths and physics A
level to children in remote parts of
the country. “The community did a
lot for me so I wanted to do a lot for
the community,” she stated.
Rachel managed to raise around
£12,000 to build a new library at the
school where she taught during her
stay on the island. The money was
raised through sponsored bike rides
and half marathons.
Sadly the library construction
plans must now be put on hold as the
cyclone has apparently devastated
the school site. Rachel hopes that
the funds can be redirected into
rebuilding the school.
“Basically the project got started
before the Cyclone hit – we’d just
been trying to support the school.
We’d set up all of our … building
committees and communication
networks and then the cyclone came
and destroyed everything.
“We decided that the school’s not
going to be needing a library any time
soon, the school’s probably going to
be needing a school – so we’ve put
that on hold and decided to basically
use the network we’ve already created
to do some fundraising for the relief
effort”.
Cyclone Pam made land contact
with Vanuatu last week and caused
widespread damage. 90% of the
buildings in Vanuatu are understood
to have been affected by the storm.
It is believed that the majority
of islanders have been displaced
from their homes and huge tracts of
farmland have been wiped out. Up
to 80% of the population engages in
subsistence agriculture as a primary
economic activity.
Organisations such as the Vanuatu
Red Cross, UNICEF Pacific and
Australian Oxfam have launched
disaster relief campaigns, and
a number of governments have
declared aid.
Rachel explained her plans for
the money raised by the Tanbok
Project, including the funds collected
previously for the school library:
“The money that’s been coming in
since Saturday night will be going
specifically to hurricane repairs
elsewhere on the island.
“The money that’s raised already,
people donated that money believing
that they were donating for this
library for the school. So either way,
that money will be reserved for that
school”.
She also revealed plans to arrange
partnerships between schools in the
UK and Vanuatu. “The longer-term
plan is to get schools [here] to support
schools out there … to pair them up
and say this is your partner school
that’s had a roof blown off, and have
them run events”.
The Tanbok Project hopes to use
their connections in the region to
reach overlooked, remote areas of
Pentecost and Tanbok that larger aid
organisations may struggle to reach.
They are seeking to provide
clothing and food supplies, water
tanks, tools and fuel to transport
materials around the islands. After
speaking with members of the
community in Tanbok on Thursday
19th
March, an emergency food
response has been prioritised.

efforts can be made at: http://

Premature coach departures and misogynistic
abuse from staff member for Women’s rugby
Sport Imperial employee allegedly said “I don’t care how those fat girls get home”
Imperial’s Women’s rugby teams
have been left fuming after their
Varsity match on Wednesday
due to transport mix-ups and alleged
verbal abuse from a Sport Imperial
staff member.
Coaches leaving the stadium
earlier than planned resulted in the
stands emptying during the women’s
headlining game and also led to
some girls being left stranded at the
stadium afterwards.
Further insult to injury came when
those left behind consulted a Sport
Imperial staff member, but then
overheard them saying “I don’t care
how those fat girls get home”.
The women played their headline
game to an emptying stadium after
a transport mix up meant coaches
began to leave The Stoop, based in
Twickenham, from the beginning of
the second half of their match.
This happened despite the teams
being reassured by Sport Imperial
that transport would not be departing
until their game had finished.
By the end of the game, all the
stands were completely empty, as
students had rushed to get a seat
on the coaches going back to South
Kensington, a journey that can take
over an hour to make via public
transport.
After playing the game, some of
the girls were directed onto the last
remaining coach waiting outside.
However, since the coach was also
nearly full of straggling spectators
who had been waiting for forty
minutes, a handful of girls had to stay
behind and wait for a minibus, which
also failed to appear.
The girls have told Felix they then
addressed a Sport Imperial staff
member about the missing minibus,
to which they received a less then
savoury response. He allegedly told
the girls he was fed up with dealing
with drunken students, and didn’t
have time to resolve their transport
issues.
After the girls confronted him
over his bad attitude, he proceeded
to storm off and leave them alone
outside of the Stoop, telling them as
he left to make their own way home.
The girls then told Felix that a
security guard approached them
after, asking if they were ok and if
they knew how to get home. The
security guard then radioed allegedly
the same member of staff, to which he
was heard to respond over the walkie-
talkie: “I don’t care how those fat girls
get home”.
The girls were eventually taken
back to South Kensington by another
Sports Imperial staff member later in
the evening.
Transport to the Stoop earlier in the
day was also poorly organised: one
double decker coach travelling from
the South Kensington campus only
had eight people inside, despite the
women’s rugby girls having to make
their own way there.
The girls turned up at
Hammersmith Apollo at 5pm to
meet a coach that also didn’t show
up, despite multiple reassurances
from Sport Imperial staff that a coach
would meet them there and that they
had also paid for it.
The girls therefore ordered taxis
to take them to the Stoop, based
in South West London, and only
arrived shortly before the men’s
game began. Several students called
the organisation of transportation a
“shambles”.
Up to four coaches left the Stoop
early and completely empty once they
dropped students off, due to damage
to their interior sustained during the
journey there.
There was therefore a shortage of
coaches available to take students
back to central London, which led
to people panicking over how they
were getting home and prematurely
queuing outside the stadium in a bid
to leave as soon as possible –during
the women’s game.
The women’s rugby match, touted
as the “headline act” of Varsity
2015 by Neil Mosley, head of Sport
Imperial, lasted forty minutes in
total.
It was followed by a lacklustre
awards ceremony, where IC was
crowned overall winners of Varsity,
although only staff from College,
the rugby teams and a handful of
students who had stayed behind were
present.
Sport Imperial also promised
the women’s rugby team would be
provided with dinner and drinks
after the match along with the men’s
rugby team. However, by the end
of the women’s match the men had
already been fed, been asked to leave
the dining facilities and had left the
Stoop. When the girls arrived most of
the food had already been eaten and
the remaining food was cold.
Mona Theodoraki, the Captain of
the Women Rubgy Club told Felix:
“It’s unfortunate the way that things
turned out. We played an amazing
match and both teams worked so hard
and it’s a shame that not many people
got to see it.
“Hopefully we will be given this
opportunity again in the future to
show everyone what we can do”.
Theodoraki has since issued an
email to Sport Imperial detailing
all of these events, and requesting
a public apology. In it she stated:
“Yesterday highlighted the sexism
that is unfortunately very present at
Imperial.
“As female rugby players, we have
to fight to rebrand rugby as not just a
‘man’s game’, and this poor treatment
has set us back massively. With the
stands being emptied at halftime, the
message that got sent across was that
women are not as important as men”.
The email has also been sent to
Alice Gast, the President of Imperial
College and Debra Humphris, the
Vice Provost (Education) and a
fan of the club as a whole; in the
Varsity programme she wrote an
introduction to the team, stating
that “I am particularly pleased that
the leading rugby event this year will
feature the women of the College,
recognising just how far the women’s
game in the UK has progressed”.
Neil Mosley has since offered to
meet up to discuss the allegations in
person with the team.
A spokesperson from Sport
Imperial explained that the
unplanned departure of the coaches
was outside their control: “All the
coaches were booked to leave the
Stoop at 9:45pm, after the end of the
headline game.
“Following the build-up of a crowd
around the exit to the stadium
during the final match it appears that
Stadium staff decided to announce
that coaches were leaving in an effort
to disperse the crowd.
“This was done without
consultation with any College staff
and will be investigated”. They
concluded: “Any rude or aggressive
behaviour towards athletes, students
or guests is completely unacceptable.
“Any complaints will be taken
seriously and investigated in line with
College procedures. If any allegation
relates to a member of Stadium staff
we will ensure the matter is raised
with senior managers there”.
They added that they will be
offering a refund to students who
missed out on transport because one
of the coaches missed a scheduled
stop, and will be looking into why the
women’s coaches never materialised.
Sport Imerial head Neil Mosley
told Felix: “The women’s rugby teams
capped 2015’s Varsity with a great
game, a high-note to end on in line
with the quality of competition across
this year’s sports.
“The evening was built around
women’s rugby as the centrepiece
event, with everything timed to
encourage people to see the end of the
game and the presentations.
“We’re deeply disappointed that
the early coach departures meant this
wasn’t the case. We’re liaising with
the coach company and stadium staff
to establish exactly what happened.
“Everyone involved in sport at
Imperial knows that players and
supporters deserve better than this
and we’re sorry that the problems
people encountered meant that the
occasion didn’t live up to the quality
of sport on the field”.
