That definitely looks like the place where I would like to thrash my opponents

It’s coming to that time of year
again: revision. At this point, you
have been told multiple times that
you only have x-amount of weeks left,
and everyone is freaking out about
how they haven’t started revising yet.
However, as a gamer my foremost
thought is how I am going to keep up
my gaming habit, while still avoiding
failing. Dear reader, if these thoughts
have also crossed your mind, do not
fear, for after 3 years at I feel like I have
amassed enough experience to help you
achieve at least that 2.2!
My first piece of advice is, avoid time
intensive games like RPGs. It is hard
to really get into those kind of games
without investing a lot of time into
them. Therefore, a quick session to
calm your mind down will end up as
a monster session, and the next thing
you know you will be doing a Leroy
Jenkins in your exam. Therefore games
like, Skyrim, WoW or Dragon Age are a
definite no-go.
Logic demands that you should play
games that allow you to get in, get your
fix and get back working. These games
include things like Counter strike, FIFA,
LOL and DOTA. All these games have a
format, which has a defined beginning

On Thursday and Friday of
last week the inaugural
championship was held at
the UK’s new gaming arena, the
Gfinity Arena in Fulham Broadway.
This is the first gaming arena in
the country, taking up three of the
screens of the Vue cinema located
in the shopping centre outside of
Fulham Broadway tube station. The
event, Hearthstone Spring Masters,
which took up most of the two days,
was won by Firebat the current
world champion beating Sosuz four
matches to one.
Now I have to admit that I had
not played Hearthstone until the
night before, having just won a ticket
from a raffle Gfinity was running
to promote the event, I did not know
what to expect. The regular ticket
price was £15 for the main stage for
the day or £12.50 for the challenge
stage, which probably covered some
of the $7,000 prize pool. Upon
entering the cinema I could see that
one half of the entrance hall had
been taken over by Gifinity branding
and the staff directed me to the three
cordoned off screens that make up
the Gfinity arena. I was then given
a wrist band, with access to both
screens, so that I could come and go
over the course of the two days.
The main stage was screen 1 and
consisted of dimly lit two booths,
which I assume where sound proof, a
caster’s (read commentator) box and
a lots of light and sound rigging were
located; the challenge screen, screen
2, was much the same. The main
screen showed one of the competitors
hand, and would switch depending
on whose turn it was. The event
went without any problems, save
for one match I watched were they
could not get a stream from one of
the computers. This event seemed
to be the cheapest of those for which
tickets have been released, most
of the other events costing £17.50
for main stage access, going up to
£50 for VIP seating for the CSGO
(Counter Strike Global Offensive)
tournament.
Now you may not have heard of
Gfinity before, that’s because they
are an extremely new company that’s
part of the ever growing e-sports
seen. They are a UK based and they
organises online competitions in a
number of different video games,
such as Call of Duty (CoD), CSGO,
and Fifa. eSports is already very
well established in America with
MLG (Major League Gaming) doing
much the same job as Gfinnity,
however it has been around since
2002. The upcoming MLG CoD
championships for example have a
prize pot of $1million. With each
member of the winning team in the
CoD championships walking away
with $100,000 in addition to major
sponsorship deals that a win would
inevitably yield.
Earlier last week Gfinity
announced that they will be opening
a second Arena soon, probably in
conjunction with Vue again, however
they have not said where it will be.
There looks to be a full season of
events at the arena this year so if
you are interested in eSports, or
just gaming in general, I would
recommend checking it out. One
thing is for sure the evolving world of
eSports is now serious business and
whether you think that it’s a sport or
not, it is here stay.

and end, with a usual game time of
about an hour. This sets boundaries and
cuts out any excuses. As long as you can
it to one game at a time, then these guys
will perfectly satisfying your gaming
needs while still allowing you to study.
Part of the appeal of playing these
short games, is that they require
little to no thought. Your brain will
be exhausted from all that difficult
revision, so why play something that
requires you to solve puzzles and/or
actually have to think about? These
things are supposed to let you relax,
without having to mundane things like
watching television.
Also, have set times when you play
your games, and make sure you stick to
our routine. The more you vary around
the times, the less disciplined you will
be when it comes to stopping. I find, a
cheeky CSGO match after dinner from
6-7, wakes me up enough to continue
studying afterwards.
However, the most important
aspect is discipline. Once you get that
dopamine flowing in your veins, it
is indeed hard to stop. Yet, you must
be strong and fight the temptation
that strikes you. While of course
gaming is very important (if not the
most important), we have spent a
considerable amount on our education.
Don’t waste it!
Anyway guys, have fun, dominate
those games and good luck!
Defintely the right attitude!! Photo: troll.me
