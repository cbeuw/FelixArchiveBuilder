Mental illness affects a quarter of the population yet there is still a stigma around it. Mentality aims to change this by
running campaigns throughout the year to raise awareness, reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, and most
notably, helping people to seek support for their problems.
Suffering from mental health problems can be scary, isolating and confusing, especially when you feel there is nowhere
to turn, thus Mentality seeks to highlight and clarify key points of access within college when seeking help. In addition to
this, Mentality hopes to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and educate students about the importance of it.
Support the campaign and have your say on mental health at Imperial by filling in the survey here:

As it’s the Easter holidays, we’ve got 25 Easter eggs to be won by volunteers
logging their hours for Imperial Plus. An Easter egg will be won for every 10th
volunteering hour logged. So if you’re the 10th, 20th, 30th 40th person to log
and submit volunteer hours for approval between now and Easter Monday on
6 April, you’ll win a chocolate Easter egg (only one Easter Egg can be won per
person!). When the eggs are gone, they’re gone! So don’t miss out on your
chance for a chocolate treat!
Do you volunteer but haven’t registered yet? It’s not too late! Register online
today at: imperialcollegeunion.org/imperialplus
