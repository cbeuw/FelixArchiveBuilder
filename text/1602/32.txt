Small Nonogram Slitherlink
The objective of this logic puzzle is to connect the dots with horizontal and vertical
lines to form a single continuous line/loop. In addition, the numbers in the grid
indicate the total number of adjacent segments within the loop.
Back due to popular demand, here are two Nonograms for you to complete: one small
and one large. Shade in cells according to the numbers at the end of the rows and and
columns.
