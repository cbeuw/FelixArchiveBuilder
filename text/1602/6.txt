Imperial entrepreneurs receive prize
for sustainable fashion initiative
Clothes-swapping business
Clotho, founded by Imperial
graduates Vivien Tang and
Caroline Wood, has been named joint
winner of the Mayor of London’s Low
Carbon Entrepreneur Prize.
The two women set up the
sustainable fashion initiative last
October; they met at Imperial and
previously worked together as
Chemistry lab partners.
Clotho provides a way for women to
exchange their unwanted clothes for
other items via an online shopping
platform. The idea came about after
Caroline lent Vivien a dress she’d
never worn before.
When Vivien began wearing the
dress frequently the pair realised that
there must be loads of clothes hidden
in the back of women’s wardrobes
that are never worn, but never given
away as they are deemed too valuable.
They set up the business from
Vivien’s bedroom, choosing the name
Clotho from Greek mythology, and
have subsequently been developing
the initiative across London and
universities in the UK.
As part of the Mayor of London’s
competition, Vivien pitched the
business to a panel of judges at City
Hall in London including Innocent
Drinks co-founder Richard Reed,
retired British sailor Dame Ellen
MacArthur and ITV news presenter
Charlene White.
After winning the top prize Vivien
said “The competition was fantastic,
and it was a great opportunity to meet
other young entrepreneurs. I would
definitely encourage anyone with a
business idea to just go for it”.
The £20,000 award will be split
between the two winners, who may
spend it however they choose to
expand their business. Clotho has also
received a grant from the European
Union’s Climate KIC initiative.
After another pitch in front of top
fashion executives at a conference
in London earlier this month,
Vivien and Caroline secured further
support from London-based retail
and consumer start-up accelerator
TrueStart.
Caroline said “We are really
excited to be building a sustainable
business that people love. Working
with Vivien is so much fun ­we are
so thankful for all the funding and
support we’ve receive and are now
really looking forward to growing
Clotho over the coming months”.
To take part in an exchange with
Clotho go to clotholondon.co.uk, where
you can arrange for your clothes to be
collected. They sort through the items
and estimate their retail value before
sending you a credit voucher equal to
the value of your submitted clothes,
minus a 15% transaction fee. Use
your credit to choose clothes from the
shop, which restocks Sundays at 9pm. Vivien Tang and Caroline Wood, AKA The Clotho Girls Photo: Clotho
