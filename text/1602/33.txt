THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 45

Back in April of last year, there
was a vision. A vision shared
by two chemical engineers;
to start a sports legacy for their
department. And so, having created
a procrastinating nest of Imperial
students revising for exams/hoping
for a miracle, Max Fawcett and Will
Batchelor laid the foundations, as
captain and manager respectively,
for the first Chemical Engineering
football team.
Come October, the team had been
formed. ChemEng students from all
years turned out for the first ever
match that this fledgling team would
play, a pre-season friendly against
Queen’s Tower Rangers. The team
warmed up, psyched up, kicked off,
and then duly lost 6-4. Not exactly the
dream start that had been imagined.
While this defeat would have
demoralised most teams, the men of
ChemEng did not falter. With the
manager drawing up new tactics,
the team arrived at Hyde Park for
the first game of the season against
feared veterans Linstead Hall, and
proceeded to comprehensively
dominate the match (and literally
send Linstead into mid-match crisis
talks) to seal a 3-1 win.
The rise to the top had started.
Throughout the first month of
the season, ChemEng remained
undefeated with a string of victories,
catapulting them to the top of the
league. But a shock 1-0 defeat to
Pembridge and Parsons Hall in
week 5 brought them crashing back
to terra firma, bringing about a
shaky run of form. Entering the
season’s latter stages, ChemEng
had only won two of the last five
matches. The dream looked in peril,
but ChemEng believed; the team
rallied, impressively routing all of its
remaining opponents to claim the
league title with one game to spare!
However, the greatest challenge was
yet to come – the cup final. Having
progressed through the quarters
and semis with decisive wins over
Xenia and Beit, ChemEng arrived at
the hallowed grounds of Harlington
for the final. After a few drills and
a quick warm-up, they kicked off
against Southside. This match proved
to be both the strangest and toughest
yet; Lotanna Agu (the Yaya Touré of
ChemEng) injuring himself in the line
of duty after 20 minutes, Mayowa
“Mario Balotelli” Okulate abusing
that finesse button to score the only
goal in the game at the 60 minute
mark, before refusing to celebrate
(“why always me?”), Sandy Nimmo
trying, and failing, to skill the
opposition striker as the last man just
outside the box, forcing our keeper
Ankush Nehra to perform a David
De Gea-esque save to keep us ahead,
and Jonathan Trofimov managing
to instigate a “fracas” involving
“fisticuffs” by just looking at someone
(luckily it did not evolve into a
“kerfuffle”), with the ref refusing to
send anyone off because he had left
his cards at home.
After a tense second half, under
pressure from a valiant Southside
team, the final whistle was blown, and
ChemEng were the winners, claiming
the Double for ChemEng in its first
year of formation.
Max, Will and the team had
fulfilled that vision set out (not) so
long ago.

Hockey win LUSL Cup against King’s GKT
Having won a hard fought
battle against RUMS in the
semi-final, IC travelled to
Royal Holloway to take part in the
final of the London Universities Cup
against King’s GKT on Saturday.
GKT had previously beaten IC in
a pre-season friendly in the only
meeting of the two teams this season,
finishing 2nd
in the BUCS league
above IC meant that on paper they
were surely favourites to take the
Cup title. However, coach Cooper
had prepared a game plan tailored
their style of play and because of this
IC were confident in their ability to
cause an upset.
The game began at a high tempo
with good passing interplay displayed
by both teams. Defensively IC were
the stronger side, Pollock was able
to completely shut down GKT’s
useful right back and the rest of
GKT’s attacking efforts were like
water breaking on rock against the
ever sturdy defensive line. IC looked
threatening however and about 10
minutes into the game, a searching
aerial from Hedgecock managed
to find Dittmar high up the pitch.
Dittmar threaded the ball through
to Pollock at the top of the D who
calmly slipped the ball between the
keeper’s legs and into the goal.
IC continued to apply pressure in
attack. Following one of his signature
penetrating dribbles, super-sub
Cerulus played a ball through to
Breakey in the D. With the keeper
charging out to meet the ball, Breakey
only had to touch the ball to Dittmar
on his left, who passed the ball into
the open net.
GKT fought back in the second
half and managed to level the score
with a rehearsed penalty corner and
a flick, their relief did not last long
however. A clever pick of the ball by
Dittmar from a GKT defender saw a
pass through to Breakey at the top of
the D. Keen to impress his girlfriend
supporting on the side-line, he
drilled a reverse stick shot into the
bottom left hand corner of the goal.
GKT again equalised, but further
aggression from IC yielded results,
a baseline run from Cerulus gifting
Breakey with an easy finish, for 4-3.
IC’s final goal was from yet another
pinpoint cross by Cerulus to gift Price
with an easy tap in.
Sensing that defeat was upon them
GKT threw everything they had at
the IC defence in the dying moments
of the game. GKT scrambled a goal
back, but the IC defence refused to be
beaten again, with some particularly
heroic tackles from Murray helping
to retain the 5-4 lead. Thanks to
arguably their best game of hockey
all season, and some top drawer
tactics from Cooper, IC secured a well-
deserved win and the LUSL Cup title.
