Alexander McQueen’s ‘Savage Beauty’ exhibiton
at the V&A, reviewed by Elizaveta Tchebaniouk,
showcases pieces from collections spanning his
entire legendary career as a fashion designer
Lose your mind in
Alexander McQueen’s World
Entering one of the most
anticipated fashion exhibitions
of all time, I was more than
startled to come face to face (literally)
with Alexander McQueen. A large
black screen looms past the entrance
doors of the V&A’s Savage Beauty,
showing McQueen’s illuminated face,
which slowly morphs into a gold skull
mask to the soundtrack of ominous
music. I felt as if I was entering not
only the exhibition, but the mind of
Alexander McQueen itself.
The exhibition, which broke records
during its residency at New York’s
Metropolitan Museum of Art in
2011, is a series of 10 rooms, each
dedicated to a prevailing concept
central to McQueen’s collections
and vision as a whole, and follows a
more-or-less chronological pattern of
McQueen’s collections, from his 1992
Central Saint Martins MA graduate
collection, to his last fully realized SS
2010 collection.
The first rooms, titled London and
Savage Mind, feature the beginning
of McQueen’s fashion career.
Displayed are several of McQueen’s
early works from Saville Row which
show his innovative techniques yet
precision and mastery of tailoring,
as well as the silhouettes particular
to McQueen which form the basis
of his more radically complex and
revolutionary designs shown later in
the exhibition.
A highlight are the pieces from
McQueen’s controversial Highland
Rape (AW 95) collection, which
referenced McQueen’s Scottish
ancestry, and marked the birth of the
iconic tartan and ‘Bumster’ trousers.
McQueen’s early runways established
his reputation for the theatrical and
the shocking, but this is only a taste
of what is to come.
The following room, Romantic
Gothic, is breathtaking not only
in content, but also in design. The
interior and soundtracks of every
room are perfectly crafted to set
the ideal background for the theme
and designs displayed, so that one
feels fully immersed in the dynamic
world being portrayed. The walls
are transformed into gold-framed
mirrors spotted with black specks,
conveying an antique feeling. The
design features of this room have a
historic feel, such as black Victorian
lace and silhouettes, with provocative
modern twists, such as fetishistic
leather masks. The evident theme
of contrast in these pieces is central
to McQueen – his exploration of
the transformational power of
fashion, how a design can be both
beautiful and disturbing, feminine
and threatening. For example,
the black swan dress from the AW
2009 collection displayed evokes
McQueen’s continuous exploration of
the female body as metamorphic.
The theme of untamed nature
present throughout many of
McQueen’s collections is further
explored in the next room –
Romantic Primitivism. The room
itself is a dark cave made of human
skulls and bones, with a glass egg-
shaped “pool” at the top showing the
underwater film of a drowning girl
in a torn chiffon dress which opened
McQueen’s Irere SS 2003 runway.
This disturbingly beautiful habitat
houses McQueen’s fascination with
the natural world. These pieces, for
example the iconic blazer from the
AW 1997 collection with gazelle
horns twisting from its shoulders,
evoke an animalistic sense of power
and fear; an energy that McQueen felt
was also present in sex.
The following Romantic
Nationalism room shocked me
with its opulent and graceful red,
white and gold royal themes – it
clearly showed how diverse and
different McQueen’s creations were.
The pieces are complimented with
Swarovski crystal encrusted masks –
characteristically McQueen.
Cabinet of Curiosities, which
follows, is the heart of the exhibition.
Entering the high ceiling gallery
left me speechless; more than
120 garments and accessories are
displayed here alongside 21 screens
showing McQueen’s runways.
Each piece displayed is more a work
of art than an accessory. The pieces
transcend all constraints of fashion
design and technical possibilities;
from the use of unexpected materials
to particularly unconventional
designs, the pieces clearly push the
boundaries of what is the defined
norm of an ‘accessory’. This room
is a most impressive proof of how
McQueen’s diverse collaborations
helped inspire and realise his full
vision. Despite the clear fetishistic
implications of the pieces (McQueen
himself remarked “I like the
accessory for its sadomasochistic
aspect”), I found none of the pieces
shocking. In all of McQueen’s
designs, there is a profound aesthetic
of finding beauty in the most
shocking and unexpected of sources.
In the centre revolves a dress,
which again establishes McQueen’s
catwalks as a dramatic place that
made a statement and evoked
emotion. It is the dress that was
spray painted by two robotic guns
on the revolving model during the
finale of McQueen’s SS99 to show
the creative process itself. Savage
Beauty’s recreation of this moment
pays homage to McQueen’s ability to
shock the fashion industry through
his unconventional ideas.
The next room is also tribute to the
completely unpredictable originality
of McQueen’s designs and catwalks.
It is a recreation of McQueen’s
AW2006 show finale where Kate
Moss appeared as a hologram floating
above the catwalk before vanishing.
The illusion was not done digitally,
but using a 19th
century technique.
This was one of my favourite
moments in Savage Beauty – there is
something indescribably poignant
and melancholic in the rippling white
silk organza floating through space to
the classical symphony soundtrack.
This was a wonderful contrast to the
other dark and aggressive pieces.
In Romantic Exoticism more of
McQueen’s unexpected designs, of a
more fragile and sensual aesthetic,
are displayed. These show McQueen’s
inspiration by eastern cultures
and nature; they are versions of
a traditional kimono-like design
with a radical modern reworking.
These pieces were part of another
of McQueen’s catwalks with an
elaborate narrative, where he staged
a chess game of ‘East’ vs. ‘West’,
inspired by Harry Potter and the
Philosopher’s Stone.
Romantic Naturalism shows
the most enduring influence on
McQueen. McQueen’s nature-
inspired designs emphasised the
ephemeral quality of the world. For
example, displayed here is a dress
that was originally made of silk and
real flowers, which fell and withered
on the runway during the show as a
profound display of beauty among
death and decay. Many aspects of
death seemed to influence McQueen,
ranging from its presence in power
and submission, to death’s romantic
melancholy. As death is a subtle motif
The ‘Platos Atlantis’ gallery at Savage Beauty, the V&A Photo: The Victoria and Albert Museum, London
present throughout all of McQueen’s
collections, it is reflected throughout
Savage Beauty.
Plato’s Atlantis is the finale of
Savage Beauty, and features pieces
of McQueen’s last fully realised
collection of the same name.
Acclaimed McQueen’s greatest
triumph, it was the first show to be
live streamed online, and followed
a dystopian narrative of human
devolution in order to survive
underwater. The mannequins wear
famous 30.5cm Armadillo boots
(once worn by Lady Gaga). The way
the collection is displayed – on
specially created mannequins,
before a large screen, and along
thematic music, conveys a sense of
nature morphing with technology.
Plato’s Atlantis displays McQueen’s
remarkable visions of modernising
nature without taming it, of finding
beauty in the grotesque, and of the
future of fashion.
Reluctantly exiting Savage
Beauty, I was bid farewell to by
a quote of McQueen’s which, I
think, encapsulates the spirit
of the exhibition: “I’m going to
take you on journeys that you’ve
never dreamed possible”. Whilst
exploring Savage Beauty, I felt I was
experiencing something that was
less of a fashion exhibition, and more
of a journey through another world
of unimaginable creativity. The
diversity of McQueen’s revolutionary
"One feels
fully
immersed
in the
dynamic
world
being
portrayed."
"Kate Moss
appeared as
a hologram
floating
above the
catwalk
before
vanishing."
"It was the
first show
to be live
streamed
online, and
followed a
dystopian
narrative"
McQueen’s achievements both as an
artist and a designer. The last room of
the exhibition with McQueen’s final
collection and what is considered to
be his ‘magnum opus’ draws to mind
the last lines of Gilbert’s poem:
“I believe Icarus was not failing as
he fell, but just coming to the end of
his triumph”. Ending the exhibition
with McQueen’s greatest triumph
affirms his undying legacy and in.
McQueen once said, “I want to be
the purveyor of a certain silhouette…
so that when I’m dead and gone
people will know that the twenty-first
century was stated by Alexander
McQueen”. Savage Beauty succeeds in
proving that McQueen fully realised
his goal.
"Death is
a subtle
motif
present
throughout
McQueen’s
collections"
work conveys a sense that his mind
was almost superhuman; it belonged
to another world both wildly ancient
and futuristic all at once, a world
where boundaries imposed by norms
are replaced by infinite possibilities.
The publicity of McQueen’s
tragically premature death had
unfortunately overpoweringly
tainted the perception of his legacy
for many who came to regard it as a
heartbreaking failure to his brand
as a whole. When faced with this, a
line from Jack Gilbert’s poem comes
to mind – “Everyone forgets that
Icarus also flew”. To me, Savage
Beauty draws a parallel between the
view of Icarus in Gilbert’s poem and
McQueen; it reminds the audience of
