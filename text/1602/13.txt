Not such a Modest Mouse

Earlier this week, rumours
were rife that Kanye West,
having established himself as
a true anglophile following a BRIT
performance and a secret show at
KOKO in the last month, was going
to announce that he was headlining
Glastonbury.
Instead, he posted loads of photos of
his naked wife, in celebration of her
reaching 30 million Twitter followers.
It’s always nice when you get a few
likes on your profile pic, but this was
hardly the announcement music fans
were waiting for. On Monday night,
Emily Eavis, daughter of 80-year-old
Michael who started the Somerset
festival, announced that Yeezy would
indeed be headlining the Pyramid
stage on Saturday night.
Hoorah, loads of people thought
and tweeted. We are so beyond that
point in 2008 where tickets for
Glasto didn’t sell out instantly when
Jay Z was announced. Organisers
maintained that this was because of
consistently bad weather over the last
couple of festivals, rather than regular
attendees not liking the idea of a hip
hop headliner. Since then we’ve had
Coldplay and Beyoncé.
We’ve come along way. Man of the
people Noel Gallagher, who hasn’t
produced anything relevant since the
year 2000, told the press that booking
Jay was just “wrong”. Eventually
tickets did sell out and Greenpeace
got their couple of million quid,
which had been adorable organiser,
Michael Eavis’ only big worry.
Incidentally, Jay drew a humungous
crowd, as all headliners do, opened
with ‘Wonderwall’ and smashed it. He
played up to the haters with humour
and the best tool possible, a fantastic
performance.
Noel’s argument was that
Glastonbury wasn’t “broke, so
why fix it”. No Noel, Glastonbury
isn’t broken, despite having been
desperate enough to get Oasis to
headline for a second time in 2004.
Its formula of having three world-
dominators play the evenings and
basically anyone you’ve heard of
within the last year the rest of the
time probably won’t break for a while
yet. I’m yet to meet anyone who’s
ever liked all three headliners more
than once.
You enter a sort of agreement on
that dreaded morning in October
when tickets first go on sale. Usually,
no one has been announced yet. The
organisers are still recovering and
there are too many Red Stripe cans
and tent pegs left from that year’s
festival to let the cows back yet, but
you trust in the organisers with
that fifty quid deposit, and assume
that, like every year, there’ll be so
many good bands playing that you’ll
inevitably kick yourself for missing
some of them.
Was I the only person who didn’t
really fancy seeing Metallica last
year? Probably not. But I didn’t bitch
and whine and make a change.org
petition about it as though if we got
enough signatures someone would
take it to Downing Street. When we
went to print, this actual petition,
that really exists, had racked up
43,000 signatures. I’m not saying you
can’t hate Kanye West. Love or loathe
his back catalogue or latest offering,
the man is undoubtably a bit of a mug
and has often shown a bad attitude.
He sure as hell won’t be spotted
sneaking into a secret James Blake
show at the Park Stage. Like Shirley
Bassey before him, he’ll be promptly
helicoptered to safety before Kim’s
Hunters can touch the ground. It’s
okay not to like bands. In all honesty,
I was sceptical when they booked
Dolly Parton last year. But oh my,
must we pretend that that if we get
enough twirps to sign and tweet that
this will ever get changed?
Are you honestly telling me that
none of those 43,000 people would
be embarassingly miming along to
most of Gold Digger on that Saturday
Like the slow unwrapping of a
present shaped exactly like what
you asked for, you already know
what’s inside and you can savour
every second of its discovery. Starting
with the song that named the album
(or was it the album that named the
song?), we are slowly eased back into
Isaac Brock’s stabbing vocals, cutting
through instrumental sheets that
wrap us in a cocoon of self-reflection,
Modest Mouse style. It feels like our
ears have gone through a decade-long
creative desert and now need to be
retrained on what years of evolution
perfected them for: the distilling
of subtle pressure waves into the
harmonic vibrations that make our
core shudder.
Now that we are tuned in to the
right frequency and introductions
are over, ‘Lampshades of Fire’
explodes all over your face like a
spring-loaded box. Suddenly we are
celebrating human destruction of
the world, told to pack up again and
find another planet to burn and chop
down. Wait, what? Never mind. The
slow, introspective, ‘Shit in Your
Cut’ is already evolving into an
epic crescendo to prelude ‘Pistol (A.
Cunaman, Miami, FL, 1996)’. Then
you notice you’re dancing to the first-
person account of the preparations
for the killing spree that lead to
Gianni Versace’s murder.
‘The Ground Walks, with Time in a
Box’ cheerfully predicts the man-
made apocalypse we are collectively
heading towards, ‘Coyotes’ and
‘Pups to Dust’ highlight that us,
humans, are born and die the same:
compulsive liars and serial killers
with an instinct for destruction.
‘Sugar Boats’ prods us into
reflecting on our search for
alternatives for this beautiful Earth
instead of attempting to fix it. ‘Be
Brave’ warns us that the world will
carry on without us just like it has for
the almost totality of its existence
and in ‘The Tortoise and the Tourist’
Brock pens a modern Brothers
Grimm fable on humanity’s self-
destructive ignorance that will lead us
into doom. We are questioned about
our persistent focus on superficial,
pathetic problems in ‘The Best Room’
and are prompted to explore the
outdoors, embrace nature, enjoy it,
take it in, live and experience it before
it is gone. This sixth and much-
awaited work of the Washingtonian
band then ends with a critique to
night? I had a look at change.org
last night, but only to sign the more
realistic plea to have Alan Partridge
replace Clarkson on Top Gear. It also
turns out that the bloke who started
the petition hasn’t even got a ticket.
And since has money has certainly
already changed hands, I doubt he’ll
be going for re-sale. Kanye is playing
Glastobury, guys, get over it.
Glastonbury tickets go on sale again in
the first week of April.
our obsessive search for evidence
of the existence or absence of a god,
someone to blame for our actions or
the creation of our dooming instincts
in ‘Of Course we Know’.
Or so I think. ‘Strangers to
Ourselves’ is ridden with the Modest
Mouse trademark: cryptic lyrics that
somehow make sense to each one of
us, regardless of interpretation and
background of the listener. It is not a
curated playlist, nor a virtual mixtape
of some songs for your spinning class.
It is a proper piece of work, written
with a purpose, a message, carefully
thought, chaotically unlevelled yet
simultaneously balanced.
"We are
so beyond
that point
in 2008
where
tickets
didn’t
sell out
instantly
when Jay Z
played."
"Kanye is
playing
Glasto,
guys, get
over it."
