Working Holiday – the sustainable
and immersive way to travel
Ihad been fascinated by the
concept of working holiday
for a while now and even more
so when an old friend of mine
embarked on her own journey
to Australia with her boyfriend,
updating us on her 6-months
adventure through social media. It
seems to be a popular alternative
for many young people fresh out of
University who wants to travel but
still add something to their CV.
Common working holiday
destinations are Australia and
Canada, appealing to the under-30s
all over the world, with a year-long
visa that allows them to work and
travel. It allows you to finance your
travel on the road and allows you
to stop and explore a destination
longer. Visiting a city for a few days
is completely different to living and
working there; and there’s truly no
better way to immerse yourself and
experience the culture than to go and
get your hands dirty.
Before you get all excited – going
on a working holiday is no walk in
the park. To make it easier for you all
to decide whether you are cut out for
this, here’s 3 main things to consider:
1) You will be spending time away
from your family and friends
Sure, with social media and the
Skype call, it is easy to stay in
touch with everyone back home.
But remember this: you leave the
country for a reason, don’t waste
your days waiting for that call from
home. Make sure you call home
once a week and go out and enjoy
your new life. You will inevitably
miss out on birthdays and holidays
with the family, and it’s likely that
you will feel lonely at some point in
the journey. Don’t take this lightly
because it can make or break a trip.
2) What you want to get out of it
This might seem like a silly question,
but trust me when I tell you that it’s
important. Working holiday isn’t a
holiday, it’s an experience. You will
be dependent only on yourself and
when the money runs out (assuming
that you are not made out of cash) it’s
up to you yourself to earn the dosh to
keep yourself floating. You are most
likely to work rather unsavoury jobs,
so if you are looking for a fun time
then consider saving up for a tour. A
working holiday is more for people
who want to challenge themselves,
work and have the opportunity to
visit a foreign country.
3) Do you have the time? Once again,
a working holiday isn’t a holiday. It’s
time off where you are working in
jobs that are probably not what you
want to do for the rest of your life
to sustain yourself when you travel.
This means you will be spending
months away from your normal life,
which might be the appealing point
to some but not so much to others.
If after pondering through the
questions your answers are still
yes, then you need to consider your
destinations. There’s almost no
boundary as to where you can go if
you set your heart on it.
Personally, the Down Under is
a top pick for me for all the right
reasons. Boasting a wide variety
of terrains from gorgeous sandy
beaches to the rugged out back,
as well as home to the unique
marsupials and exotic wildlife,
there’s an endless list of reasons
to visit the amazing Oz... As I had
mentioned before, Australia, as
well as New Zealand and Canada are
among those that offer great youth
visas.
Another thing is languages and
cultures, which are definitely on
the top of the consideration lists. It
isn’t easy working somewhere that
operates in a vastly different way
to the way back home, though that
might also be why it’s so attractive
to go. However, you also have
problems like visa application,
vaccination where necessary and
living expenses. Then you need to
worry about actually getting a job as
well as accommodation. And there’s
the nitty gritty of bank accounts, tax
numbers and SIM cards. Like I said,
it’s no walk in the park.
This, again, winds back to why
popular destinations are a good pick.
Many companies, for example: STA
Travel offer packages that helps you
through the entire process, from
visa application to getting a job
and securing the first few nights of
accommodation on arrival. It might
be true that you won’t be able to get
very nice, high earning jobs – but
that doesn’t mean you can’t hit the
ground running by preparing before
you leave.
Some of you are probably
wondering what the costs are, so here
I am using Australia as an example
and scoured the internet for the
cheapest quotes I can find:
STA Travel: £299 (Originally £330
but is currently on sale until 20/3!)
Visa first: £285 in 2 weeks, £315 in
48 hours
For those of you who are
wondering about the packages: most
offer help with visa, tax, CV and
getting a job, as well as the first few
nights of accommodation and even
airport transfer. Some even throw
in an orientation and an option for
a group flights. Here’s a few that I
found:
Gap 360 : Starter package for £299
(+Visa is another £300)
BUNAC: Essential support package
for £359 (+Visa is another £310)
STA Travel: Starter package from
£150 for 3 nights accommodation
on arrival (+Visa for now is another
£299)
If you are more independent and
only want help on tax and bank etc,
STA Travel offer Tax pack and Bank
account for £25 each.
So what are you waiting for? Go
and emjoy the Down Under and
escape the British weather!
