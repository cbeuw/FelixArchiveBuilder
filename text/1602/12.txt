Imperial Alumni in Politics:
Layla Moran
Layla Moran, a physics graduate
from Imperial College London
is currently running for
Parliament in the ultra-marginal
seat of Oxford West and Abingdon.
Last weekend the Imperial Liberal
Democrats popped down to help
Layla with her campaign. We caught
up with Layla over lunch.
Plabon: Tell us a bit about
yourself. How did you get into
politics?
Layla: I have a very international
background, my mum is Palestinian
and my dad is British, but he was
a diplomat so I grew up moving
around everywhere. I ended up
settling in the UK for secondary
education and went to Imperial to
do physics. I was there from 2000 to
2003. After that I went straight into
the classroom and became a physics
teacher, and it was teaching really
that got me into politics.
I ended up doing masters at
the Institute of Education in
comparative education, trying to
apply the scientific method to social
science. Having grown up sort of a
bit of everywhere, I don’t think I’d
quite appreciated how the education
system in Britain grew up over
time and learnt that actually a lot
of what both the Labour and Tory
governments had done over the
last 20 to 30 years in the education
system was the total opposite of
what people wanted, which is the
idea that if you are a child it doesn’t
really matter where you are born;
rich family, poor family, what colour
your skin is, it shouldn’t matter, you
should have the same opportunity as
everyone else.
Unfortunately the education
system in this country, by and large
does not provide that, it tends to
reinforce stratification in society
rather than helping it. So at that
point, I decided to become a MP, to
affect change in education, as a lot of
the policy is driven at that level.
I looked across the manifestos
and the policies of all the political
parties, and I decided that in fact
the Liberal Democrats had the best
policy when it came to education. It
was evidence-based policy, based on
what works, not ideologically driven.
And so I decided I would rather
spend the rest of my life fighting
for something I actually believed
in, than going with one of the major
parties and almost guaranteeing
myself a seat in Parliament. And
that brings me very much to where I
am now, where I am pleased to stand
in a seat where I actually do stand
a very good chance of winning and
hope to be able to affect that kind of
change when I become an MP.
P: How has your scientific
background helped you in politics?
L: You’d be surprised at how many
people in Parliament have no sense
of numeracy at all. Not least not
understanding what uncertainty
means. A classic example of course
being climate change deniers who
seem to think that 5% uncertainty
on models as complex as that is a bad
thing.
In fact, we all know that that’s a
really good margin of error when
you’re dealing with models that
complex. And at least being able to
understand some of the underlying
statistics to data, which is then used
to drive policy, is all about. So on
that level I found it very interesting
going into politics because I look at it
from that point of view: What’s the
data telling me? What’s the direction
of travel? How can we affect change
and help use data to help us to make
that change? So to that end I find
the Liberal Democrats actually are
very good at looking at policy and
using policy at a grassroots level and
making policy at conference through
voting.
My physics background is
hopefully unique and I’m hoping
that’ll bring something different
to the vast majority of lawyers and
other social scientists who are there
now.
P: Political apathy is generally
quite high amongst students,
especially at Imperial, which is a
science University. How would you
go about solving that?
L: I disagree with the question; I
don’t think people are politically
apathetic. I think they actually care
deeply about a lot of issues, they’re
just not necessarily party political
and they are quite disillusioned with
the current system. I do think that
the way politics is happening in this
country is changing, particularly
with the use of social media and the
Internet. People are much more in
touch with MPs. From my point of
view in Oxford West and Abingdon
I think that means being a very
present MP in your constituency.
I believe that it is your voters at the
end of the day that are your bosses;
there’s no one else who can hire and
fire you, only them and you have to
always remember that, so I intend
to be a very, very conscientious
constituency MP. But at the same
time I think you need to be using
new technology to actively engage
with people on policy issues that you
care about.
For example, I do hope to be a
champion for science, particularly
the science budget in Parliament. At
the moment we are the only party
who have committed to ring-fencing
it and I would like to make sure that
whoever ends up in government
will ring-fence the science recession
development budget. But in order to
do that I’m going to need to lobby
not just people within Parliament
but to get people from outside
Parliament with similar interests
in to have their voices heard, and
the best way I think of doing that is
through things like social media.
So there is no quick-fix answer, I
think it is changing over time but
one thing I would encourage people
to do is definitely go out and vote
and even if you spoil your ballot I’d
rather you just gave it a go and went
and learned about the process and
tried to look some people up..
P: What do you think is the
greatest problem facing students
today?
L: I think there are two aspects of it.
Students themselves are definitely
facing a cost of living crisis and
that’s the thing I’m hearing about
most, more in fact than lowering
tuition fees. I think that’s a bit of
gimmick that Labour have brought
in actually. I would much rather any
extra money to help students goes
into beefing up maintenance grants,
because so many students find that
the cost of living in so many cities in
the UK is unaffordable.
In the future though I think it’s
definitely the fact that it’s so hard
to get a job as a young person and
when you leave University you’re
quite often stuck in a catch-22 of
you have no experience so they won’t
give you a job to get the experience.
This is why the starter jobs idea is
so important. The way to do that
is to definitely tackle the deficit,
make sure you’re doing things that
are good for business. We definitely
need to do more to make sure that
businesses are focussing on the 21-
25 year old bracket and not filling
those jobs with people in their 30s
who were made redundant during

the recession. We need to make sure
that it’s an equitable and fair hiring
process. This is why I believe that
you should have age, sex and name
redaction on applications because it
shouldn’t matter how old you are, it
should matter what your skills are
as to which jobs you end up getting.
That’s an example of something
we’ve been pushing for within
Parliament and we’ve got a long way
to go but I think that something like
that would really help not just young
people but also people of ethnic
"It was
teaching
that really
got me into
politics."
"You’d be
surprised
at how
many
people in
Parliament
have no
sense of
numeracy
at all."
“Students
themselves
are
definitely
facing a
cost of
living
crisis.”
“The Lib
Dems have
very few
safe seats.
But I like
the idea of
fighting
for what
I’ve earned
rather than
being given
anything.”

candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon
minority backgrounds and other
minority communities.
P: So you mentioned the issue
of maintenance grants. However
people who get good maintenance
grants also get good bursaries
from the University and good
loans, so they’re not actually the
ones in trouble. The trouble is in
the middle where you have people
who don’t get any bursaries, no
maintenance grants just because,
lets’ say, their parents both earn
£21k and that puts them out of
the bracket.
L: That’s exactly the population I’m
talking about.
P: But then you have the issue
of increasing the maintenance
loan, increases the total debt
and that creates pressure on the
government to service that debt.
L: That’s right. I think it’s right. I
personally would have been someone
would not have voted for fees. I think
you end up giving back much more
into society when you have a degree
than if you don’t; you earn more
money so you pay more tax and over
time that works. But we are not in a
position where we are able to promise
that in the next election. But I do
think it’s ok for the government to
be putting up cheap loans so that
people can get their first degrees.
I’m also pretty proud that we
made the system more progressive;
there are more students from poorer
socioeconomic backgrounds going
to University now than ever before,
because they’re worked out that
it’s actually better for them in the
long term. But it’s not easy in this
political climate.
P: Animal testing is currently a
big issue at Imperial. What is your
view on animal testing?
L: My view is that there’s a place for
it, but it has to be done as an absolute
last resort. I think that’s it’s true
that there are some protocols that
could be done with modelling rather
than on the animals themselves, but
I think that there’s undoubtedly a
place for it.
On one hand, I am an animal
lover and I hate to see that animals
are used in anything, but also I do
believe that if you are developing,
for example, a vaccine for cats, you
really ought to test it on cats. And
a lot of these people who are anti
any kind of animal testing forget
that that applies as well to animal
medicines.
There are some no-go areas,
anything to do with makeup,
anything to do with anything
cosmetic is totally not okay. But
when it comes to cutting-edge
science, I do believe in science, I
believe that science has a place in
making the world a better place
for everybody and that involves
sometimes, in rare occasions using
animals. Britain has a very good
record on this, I have to say, and
we’ve got some of the most stringent
legislation in the world to do with
animal testing. The balance could
still be that we have an even higher
burden of proof that you need to
use animals and I still think it
needs to be under constant review
with the way science changes and
what we use if for. But by and
large I am supportive in the right
circumstances.
P: What is the Lib Dems policy
that you most disagree with?
L: Not many. It used to be nuclear.
When I first joined the party; I’m
not exactly pro-nuclear, but I am
pro-decarbonisation and I think that
sometimes there’s a root for nuclear
in the different models that we can
look at, but now actually the party
has come around to my point of view,
which is great.
I wrote the party’s policy on
fracking, which is basically extreme
scepticism, but as a scientist I am not
going to say no to a test well, because
I think you ought to see the extent of
the problem. So actually nowadays, I
have to say, there’s not much.
We don’t go far enough with
education policy. At the moment our
policy is that we are okay with free
schools. The evidence suggests that
free schools are detrimental to the
system as a whole, and would like to
see them gotten rid of completely, so
I would like to see us pull away from
those, as an example. But it’s bits and
bobs, there’s not very much that is
substantive in the party that I don’t
agree with anymore.
P: Parliament is a male dominated
area and you’d be one of the few
females there if elected. What
would you do to address the
gender balance in Parliament?
L: Well just being there, I hope,
will help. I think one of the issues
for a lot of women is that there
aren’t very many people like them
in Parliament, so it’s about partly
creating a role model. That said, I’m
not sure I would necessarily have
gone for it in the way that I did if
it wasn’t for people like Jo Swinson
and Willot, who are young and had
their families while they were in
Parliament.
You know, there’s another side to
my life; I don’t think you should get
rid of your personal life because you
want to be a Parliamentarian. It’s
important to see role models like
them who have done both, and done
it well. So I don’t think there is an
easy answer.
Something to bear in mind is the
reason the Lib Dems have such a
poor record on this is because we
don’t have safe seats, so I’m part
of the leadership program in the
party where minority candidates
are helped; given extra training, and
we’re told we are some of the best
candidates in the party. Yet, we have
very few safe seats.
So this seat, which is basically on
a knife-edge and will all depend on
the size of the campaign is almost as
good as it gets within the Lib Dems.
It’s so uncertain. We don’t have the
luxury of being able to parachute
anyone. But then I don’t think that’s
a bad thing either, because I like the
idea of fighting for what I’ve earned
rather than being given anything.
P: Describe yourself with a movie
or song title.
L: ‘Life is a Rollercoaster’ by Ronan
Keating. I hate that song, by the way,
but it’s a good title.
P: If money was no problem, what
would be the first thing you’d do?
L: I’d buy a house. I’m so desperate
to buy a house, and I can’t afford
it. What they don’t tell you about
campaigning is that it takes up a lot
of your time and a lot of your money,
and you don’t get paid as a candidate.
So, by the end of this process, I will
have nothing left in the bank.
So yeah, if I won the lottery or
something, that would be awesome,
I’d buy a house, that’d be cool.
P: Were you part of any societies
at Imperial?
L: I was University Quiz Master for
a little while, which was super fun.
On Wednesday night at the Union
I would write the quizzes and then
argue with people when they said
my answers were wrong, so that was
really fun.
For a while I was part of the Jazz &
Rock Society, but I went to couple of
meetings and that was pretty much
it.
P: House of Cards or Game of
Thrones?
L: No! I can’t make that choice!
That’s my answer.
P: Who is your favourite Doctor
Who?
L: David Tennant. Big David
Tennant fan.
P: Describe the four party leaders
with a movie title.
L: Cameron – A Nightmare on Elm
Street
Farage – Armageddon
Clegg – A Series of Unfortunate
Events
Miliband – That Awkward
Moment
