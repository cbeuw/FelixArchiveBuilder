THE World Reputation Rankings place Imperial 14th
In the latest release of the Times
Higher Education (THE) World
Reputation Rankings, Imperial
College London dropped one place
from 13th
in 2014 to 14th
in 2015. The
THE World Reputation Rankings
are a spin-off supplement from the
internationally acclaimed THE
World University Rankings, where
Imperial currently retains its strong
top 10 position.
While the World University
Rankings utilize 13 separate
performance indicators grouped
under five categories: teaching
(30%), research (30%), citations
(30%), industry income (2.5%) and
international outlook (7.5%), the
World Reputation Rankings are
formed using a large invitation-only
academic survey, which took place
at the end of 2014 and saw tens of
thousands of responses.
Barring the University of Tokyo
(12th
), ETH Zurich (15th
) and the
University of Toronto (16th
), the top
20 places in the Reputation Rankings
are chiefly occupied by American
universities, with British institutions
taking 4 out of the 20 spots. Harvard
University regularly tops the list;
this year it was followed by both
Cambridge and Oxford, which came
in 2nd
and 3rd
respectively.
According to THE, the World
Reputation Rankings are “based
on nothing more than subjective
judgement – but it is considered the
expert judgement of senior, published
academics, the people best placed to
know the most about excellence in
our universities”.
Institutions are not allowed to
nominate survey participants, and
no one is allowed to sign up for the
survey without an invitation, thus
meaning that selected participants
are representing thousands of their
peers.
This year’s survey is set to play a
key part in shaping the 2015-2016
edition of the World University
Rankings, alongside a number of
other reforms. THE will be releasing
the survey in 15 languages (Arabic,
Japanese, Simplified Chinese,
Spanish, French, German, Brazilian
Portuguese, European Portuguese,
South American Spanish, Italian,
Traditional Chinese, Korean, Turkish,
Russian and English), an increase
from the 9 used in the last survey.
In addition, where the survey was
previously outsourced to Thomson
Reuters, THE is now seeking to take
full responsibility and ownership
of the survey and its data, with
distribution being carried out in
partnership with Elsevier. THE
claims that this extra control will
allow it to “publish more detailed
profiles of institutional reputation
globally and to be more responsive to
the sector’s data needs.”
Phil Baty, editor of the THE
World University Rankings, said the
following: “We would like to thank
in advance all scholars who will be
helping us to create this rich and
important picture of global higher
education.
By lending a small amount of
their precious time, and – more
importantly – by lending their
expertise, they will become part of an
extraordinary global research project
that will shape the THE rankings and
wider performance metrics”.

Budget 2015: Government announces
plans for £25,000 loans for PhD students
Cecily Johnson finds out what the new Budget has to offer
The government has revealed
plans to offer income-
contingent loans of up to
£25,000 for PhD and research-based
masters students in the latest Budget
report, George Osborne’s sixth as
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
According to the Treasury,
a package of measures will be
introduced “to broaden and
strengthen support for postgraduate
researchers”, including a review into
how to bolster the UK’s funding for
postgraduate research.
“This review will examine the
balance between number and level of
research stipends to ensure that the
UK’s offer remains internationally
competitive”.
As part of the review, the
government will consider various
methods to “strengthen partnerships
and co-funding between government,
industry and charities”, including
increased support for the crowd-
funding of scientific research.
The proposed support package will
include “income-contingent loans of
up to £25,000 to support PhDs and
research-based masters degrees. These
loans will be in addition to existing
funding, and designed to minimise
public subsidy.
“The government will work with
research councils, universities and
industry to examine how best to
design them so that they complement
existing funding streams and
continue to support the most
excellent research”.
No details have yet been provided
as to the timescale of introduction
for the proposed loans. Access
restrictions, repayment plans and the
ultimate costs of the loans to students
have also not been specified.
A loans scheme offering up to
£10,000 for taught master’s students
from 2016-17 was announced by Mr
Osborne in last December’s Autumn
Statement. These loans will be
available only to those under the age
of 30.
The new Budget also proposes
the launch of “a £400 million
competitive fund for new world
leading scientific infrastructure”. The
Science Grand Challenge Funding
project plans to seek funding matches
from charities and industry.
The fund “seeks to lever
industrial and charitable funds.
The government welcomes exciting
proposals from across the UK that
aim to push scientific boundaries and
maximise scientific impact”.
A factsheet provided by the
Department for Business, Innovation
& Skills noted that the money was
previously promised in December’s
Science and Innovation Strategy
paper, and is “an allocation of
funding from within the Science
Capital envelope”.
The Treasury stated that the
government hopes to “provide
the UK’s world-leading research
institutes with greater freedoms to
attract the brightest minds, re-invest
commercial income and develop
cutting-edge technology”.
This is the last Budget to be
presented by the current parliament
before the next General Election later
this year. The winner of the election is
likely to present another Budget this
summer.
Mr Osborne has also announced
tax cuts for first-time buyers, a 1p per
pint cut to beer duty and 2% off cider
and spirit taxes, a crackdown on tax
avoidance and an increase of 16p in
the price of cigarettes.
A 20p increase in the national
minimum wage will raise it to £6.70
per hour from October, with a 3% rise
in the statutory minimum for 18 to
20 year olds taking the hourly rate
from £5.13 to £5.30.
Welcomed by business leaders
and derided by Trade Unions,
the aspirational Budget has been
criticised by opposition parties and
described as “openly electioneering”.
