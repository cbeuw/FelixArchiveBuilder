Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte
– The Magic Flute – is
back at the Royal Opera
House in the 12th
year of David
McVicar’s production. One of the
most frequently performed operas,
Die Zauberflöte has a highly unusual
format, with the sung components
interspersed with lots of dialogue,
making it a piece that requires great
theatrical skill as well as world class
opera singers. Its storyline weaves
in and out of folk-tale, legend, and
cult, switching from enchantments to
allusions to the Freemasons. Beneath
all these nuances, Die Zauberflöte is
a boy-meets-girl tale: noble Tamino
goes on a quest to find and free
the beautiful Pamina, helped by
his comic side-kick Papageno. He
overcomes the hurdles, defeats the
baddies, and even Papageno gets a girl
– everyone is happy.
The noble couple are excellent:
beautiful, pure, and uncomplicated,
as all one-dimensional heroes should
be. In particular, Janai Brugger is
heart-breaking as Pamina, adorable
as a fragile princess, with long flowing
locks, a frilly white nighty, and a
voice like silver. Papageno (Markus
Werba) also stands out as the only
cast member who carried his spoken
lines with outstanding theatrical
prowess, coming across as a truly
relatable and comic man of the
people. Counterbalancing the more
ponderous characters, Papageno truly
made the show – though one can’t but
think he didn’t get what he deserved
in Rhian Lois’ shrill ‘Papagena’.
The Disney-ish plot is complicated
by the shifting allegiances that the
hero (and the audience) has, as the
baddies and goodies switch in front
of us. Pamina’s mother, the opulent
Queen of the Night, who sends
Tamino to find her daughter, initially
appears to be the fairy godmother
of the situation. She’s got sparkly
clothes, magic gifts, and needs our
noble hero to defeat her enemies
for her. Her antagonist, Sarastro,
captured Pamina, has a creepy rape-y
servant, Monostatos, and comes off
as the evil magician of the situation.
Yet, as Tamino’s understanding of
the situation changes, he realises that
Sarastro is an enlightened, wise and
reasonable ruler. The staging changes
from a deep blue, star-studded
backdrop with a glaring white
moon to a warm orange disk – our
transition from the darkness of night
and religious superstition into the
light of reason.
The production highlights the
feeling of a disoriented journey,
with constantly changing staging,
unexplained symbolism, darkness,
and fog. However, many aspects
of the piece were left unexplored,
such as the element of sexuality
and its repression; the Queen of the
Night’s ladies in waiting, haughty
and mysterious, descend into a brawl
over who should privately guard
Tamino while the others fetch their
mistress. Their frankness about their
desires, echoed in Papageno’s crass
comments, contrasts with the Wise
Men’s insistence on the importance
of repressing Tamino’s desires and
their instructions on resisting the
temptation of women.
A living testimony to the
Enlightenment era, Die Zauberflöte
embodies a struggle for wisdom and
truth with which we feel comfortable.
But the 18th
century was also racist
and misogynist, and these facts
jar with a modern audience that
flocks to the opera to have their soul
elevated. Monostatos may have been
cast as a white deformed monster,
rather than the “evil moor” he is
scripted as, but nothing can ease
the blow of lines such as “A woman
does little, gossips much”, “Away
with the women, to Hell”. They
are dropped in, unchallenged, and
undealt with, murmured without
comment as if in the hope of passing
them off as outdated and vaguely
comic. The conflict between reason
and superstition, logical man and
hysterical women, is an interesting
one, which has been ignored by this
production for fear of jarring with
the audience. Die Zauberflöte doesn’t
need to be sanitised, it needs to be
produced as the glorious, messy and
controversial opera that it actually is.
Die Zauberflöte was on at the Royal
Opera House from 23rd
February - 11th
March. It will be broadcast on BBC
Radio 3 at 19:30 on 13th
April.

withClaraClarkNevola’sreviewof
DieZauberflöte or TheMagicFlute,
a classic opera here performed
on the stage of the RoyalOpera
House.One of the difficulties in
producing such an oft-performed
opera is that you must invigorate
it with a unique energy that
brings something new to the
interpretation of the story.
However here,Clara finds this
was not done effectively and the
complexity of some of the themes
covered was left by the wayside.
Fred Fyles also pays a visit to
the Royal Opera House,once
again to review a classic of the
stage,this time the ballet,Swan
Lake. The ROH is famed for its
orthodox interpretations of
works,defining the standard of
how they should be performed
with an outstanding quality of
dancing.However,Fred questions
whether this kind of production is
still relevant and can still excite an
audience like some of the more
avant-garde productions of the
work have done.
Next,Max watches PlayMas at
the OrangeTreeTheatre in a
rather laclustre production of a
Trinidadian classic; bad acting
and even worse use of the unique
space left Max dissapointed with
the work.
Fred Fyles also visited the new
exhibition at the National
PortraitGallery on the Duke of
Wellington,examining his legacy
through how art depicts him.
Alexander McQueen is a
fashion legend,and in the latest
photographic exhibition at the
TateBritain,his career is taken
apart to truly exhibit the wonder
of his work.Our very own fashion
editor Cécile Borkhataria explains
just what makes him so unique
and significant in the world of
fashion.
Finally,Cale Tilford introduces
an underappreciated art form:
comics.Taking us through some
of his favourite current series,
he explains why this medium of
expression is just as rewarding as
any other.
