This week you decide to
put your computing degree
to some use and try to get
yourself laid by making a
computer game; however Call
of Booty doesn’t really take
off and if anything alienates
you from the opposite sex. Just
pick up one of those leaflets in
the phone booths on your way
home.

This week as student union
president you decide to do a
bit of amphetamine dealing on
the side as man’s gotta pay off
his credit cards. Unfortunately
your alias as Drug wheeler is
soon discovered and you are
forced to make fresh pizza
bases for the next 5 years as
your prison sentence.

This week your Lent resolution
of not masturbating is coming
to a boiling point. You are
sent to go photograph the
centrefold for Felix and the
sight of a stray nipple causes
you to explode in a tsunami
of cum. ​
This week you attempt to
get high; however you don’t
really have many contacts in
the big city and so you resort
to sniffing paint in leosoc for
that dank high. Unfortunately
the poor ventilation in the
basement leads to out of
control hallucinations and you
staple several crayons to your
nipples.
This week you are in a practical
in which you have to culture
some bacteria in a petri dish
from your cheek; however,
you decide to be rather crude
and swab your genitals. Three
weeks later Skettsvagilococus
has killed most of the
population of London, and you
decide to lay low for a while.
This week you decide to
investigate the mysterious
noises coming from behind
the walls in Reynolds. Upon
excavation, you find that
the Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin has been
trapped ever since he passed
out from too much snakebite.
This week you decide to
take a vaccine for the viral
meningitis that seems to be on
the rise; however you receive
a dodgy vaccine that those
vegans warned you about. You
then have to spend the rest of
your life as an artistic person.
This week you announce the
winning team for varsity,
which was… the medical
school? The sheer shock of this
result sends everyone present
at the stoop into cardiac
arrest that the medical school
actually won something.
Unfortunately any remaining
conscious medics are too
drunk to be useful.
This week you decide to create
an imperial music festival to
rival the current circuit by
organising Imperial-bury.
After Lorde refuses to answer
your messages anymore,
your welfare president says
his rap act will headline.
Unfortunately Ludacris-Kaye
uses a few too many racial slurs
and the festival is shut down.
This week you decide to
express your love for cars in
the form of a new TV show on
ICTV; however, by accident
you make numerous racist
remarks, which are broadcast
to the entire campus. Whoops!
At least you’ll be let off
because it was ‘banter’.
This week after a recount on
the union elections, it appears
that Lucinda didn’t really win
the elections, and a coalition
has to be formed instead. This
now means that although
sports clubs now get more
funding from Lucinda, Luke
only allows it to go to fit girls
who like cider and are faster
than at least 70% of snakes.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 0/4
Sunday 22nd March
Turns out my bite was infected, so I got developed tetanus and had to stay in hospital for three days. They
wouldn’t let me keep the diary, apparently it was a “contamination risk” or something so I had to buy a new
one from the Union Shop.
The only ones they had were limited edition Kris Kraye ones, so now I have a pin-up poster of the man
who stole my Dorothy (the human one). I put it up over my bed anyway.
Monday 23rd March
Went to lectures for the first time in weeks this morning. I don’t know why I bothered - Dorothy got loose
and started trying to eat the lecturer’s notes, and I got thrown out when I tried to stop her.
Tuesday 24th March
They took Dorothy away today. Apparently we’re not allowed pets in halls.
Wednesday 25th March
I’m actually starting to miss Dorothy (the goat one). She ate most of my notes, bit half of my course mates
and gave me tetanus, but at least she listened to me. I really felt like she understood me when I told her
about Dorothy (the not-goat one). And now they’ve taken her away from me.
Thursday 26th March
I just found out they gave Dorothy to Kris. I don’t know what’s going on with my life anymore.
