Cécile Borkhataria visits the Tate Britain’s new photography
exhibition, showcasing McQueen’s final collection
A Fitting Legacy: Nick Waplington/
Alexander McQueen – Working
Process
Last week, Nick Waplington’s
photography exhibition of
legendary fashion designer
Alexander McQueen’s final collection
opened at Pimlico’s Tate Britain.
The exhibition, based on Nick
Waplington’s book entitled Alexander
McQueen: Working Process, features
photographs of McQueen’s Fall 2009
collection – from inception to the
runway show in Paris. The exhibition
takes us on a tour of McQueen’s
creative process, from initial concept
sketches, all the way to his dramatic
final show.
The collaboration started when
Waplington was asked to come in
and see Lee (Alexander McQueen)
in 2007. McQueen wanted him to
make a photo book about his working
process for his Fall 2009 collection,
entitled The Horn of Plenty! Everything
and the Kitchen Sink. Lee knew of
Waplington’s work and favoured his
“dirty, messy style” of photography;
he gave Waplington full creative
control of the photography, telling
him “do whatever you want, this
will be your book and I will be the
subject.” At the time, Waplington
was involved with a big project in
Jerusalem and asked McQueen
if they could delay their artistic
collaboration, but Lee insisted that it
had to be the Fall 2009 season. This
collection was important to McQueen
because it was a retrospective
exploration of his previous
collections, a recycling of his ideas
from the last 15 years of his career.
The book was an unconventional
take on fashion books. Not only
did Waplington take photo’s of
McQueen’s creative process, but he
also took pictures of landfill sites,
and in particular recycling facilities,
to further convey the collection’s
recycling theme. Between the
photographs of McQueen’s creative
sketch boards and model fittings lie
large canvases of landfill sites full
of soda cans. Whilst the collection
emphasised recycling, it also served as
a social commentary to the recession
at the time, and how society had
reached this point through “rampant,
indiscriminate consumption”. The
irony lies in the garments themselves,
which are made to look like they
have been made of bin liners and
broken records, when in fact they are
made from the finest Italian silks.
This follows McQueen’s undeniable
penchant for the unconventional,
whilst also respecting the traditional
craftsmanship of haute couture. This
representation of conflict throughout
the collection is an uncompromising
combination of love and hate, which
is characteristically McQueen.
Walking through the gallery
takes you through the collection’s
chronological creative process,
emphasising one of the greatest
things about Waplington’s insightful
images; they show that McQueen was
heavily involved from the process
from start to end, which is rarely
seen in the fashion industry. First,
he would create an ‘idea board’ where
he assembled his creative vision for
a piece with photographs, fabrics,
and sketches. Then, he would cut
patterns, pin them onto a model, and
fit her into it at the end. Even when it
came to final fittings, McQueen was
there, kneeling down and perfecting
hemlines down to the last detail.
Waplington was sure to capture
all of this, showcasing not only
McQueen’s creative flair, but also
his tailoring skills, which he learnt
at the beginning of his career when
working at a suit-tailoring boutique
in London’s Savile Row.
In keeping with the theme of
recycling, vintage McQueen pieces
were remastered, such as his signature
houndstooth check fabric, which
was splattered with paint. Old pieces
were taken apart and put back
together again in different way; inside
out, upside down, or completely
restructured all together. Lee even
used one of his own bespoke Savile
row suits in the collection, which he
cut and re-tailored to fit a woman.
Not only did Lee recycle pieces from
his previous collections, but he also
brought back many people he worked
with in previous years, including
many models. He brought everything
back into play again to signify a
"The show
takes us on
a tour of
the creative
process,
from inital
concept to
final show"
"The irony
lies in the
garments,
made to
look like
bin liners
but made
of fine silk"
"To this
day
McQueen’s
pieces
provoke the
reactions
desired
from the
public"
"We see
not only
McQueen’s
creative
flair, but
also his
tailoring
skills"
renewal.
The collection saw a historic
collaboration between McQueen and
Philip Treacy to design eccentric hats
that were tailor-made for specific
outfits. The hats too, used recycled
parts, such as washing machine
hose piping and even dustbin lids.
They served as an important tool
in shaping the proportions of the
models wearing them, who were
made to look much like exaggerated
illustrations. They were taller, longer,
and leaner – a commentary on the
unrealistic image of women that the
fashion world portrays.
When the studio moved to Paris
close to the show, the atmosphere
became happy and at times stressful
in the lead up. McQueen worked
with big teams from whom he
expected a lot, and there was a
sense that everyone was working
towards a common goal. The set
design was complex, incorporating
piles of rubbish and other debris,
all underlining the theme of
consumption and recycling. The
show was also a challenge for the
models, who had to wear very high
heels, heavy hats, and complex
clothes. In keeping with McQueen’s
undercurrent of conflict throughout
his collections, the models were made
to look less feminine; red lipstick was
smeared above and below their lips,
creating an almost disturbing image
of beautiful women. This served as a
reminder of society’s obsession with
physical appearance.
After the collection was shown,
Lee and Waplington worked together
in Waplington’s studio, where
Waplington made 800 colour work
prints by hand. Of these, Lee and
McQueen selected 254 to feature in
the book.
They finally finished in November
2009, and three months later Lee
died.
For Waplington, it was a huge
privilege to work with Lee and gain
complete, unadulterated access to
the creative working process in his
studio, which he rarely opened to
others. Lee’s choice of title, The Horn
of Plenty, was a statement about
the planet and its finite resources,
of consumption and economic
prosperity, of the recession and the
impossibility of infinite growth. It
was a reflection of modern society
and a retrospective of his previous
collections, bringing them all
together in his final collection. As
there continue to be new exhibits
and commentaries on McQueen’s
revolutionary work, he lives on as
a fashion and artist. To this day,
McQueen’s pieces provoke the
reactions he desired from the public –
for them to look at it and say: “What’s
that? What’s that? What’s that? What
the hell is that?”
