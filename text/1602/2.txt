This week was meant to be
a celebration of women at
Imperial, as the women’s rugby
team was set to headline Varsity
for the very first time. The evening
was meant to pay homage to the
incredible progression of women’s
sport and in fact women at Imperial
in general, but in reality, due to the
thoughtlessness of the staff of Sport
Imperial, it fell flat on its face.
Before the women rugby players
had even reached the stadium, the
coach that was organised to take
them there failed to materialise.
Then, during the match, coaches were
allowed to leave during the girl’s final
match, despite the team stressing that
under no circumstances should they
be left to play to an empty stadium.
The team were rushed through
their cold after-match dinner, after
the men’s team had had their fill and
already left. Finally, those that were
able clambered onto a coach full of
agitated spectators that had been
made to sit there for 40 minutes,
whilst other players were left behind.
To top it all off, those who were
left behind were also apparently
verbally abused by a staff member,
who proceeded to make misogynistic
remarks about the girl’s appearances.
Although Sport Imperial state that
the transportation nightmare was
not their fault, the fact that the whole
thing wasn’t organised meticulously
months beforehand still raises
concerns. As far as I’m aware, Varsity
has been a pretty streamlined affair;
transport issues have always cropped
up but surely over time these should
have been ironed out.
The fact that Sport Imperial
haven’t outright apologised for any
of these events is testament to the
fact that no-one ever wants to appear
accountable at Imperial; no-one ever
hold up their hands and admits they
fucked up.
If Sport Imperial organise an event,
then it should run as they please,
and they shouldn’t blame coach
companies or stadium staff that they
are paying and therefore can instruct
and direct as necessary. It certainly
isn’t unreasonable to direct catering
to serve hot food at a time you would
like, and it also isn’t unreasonable to
instruct coaches to leave and arrive
when you choose.
Not only that, the fact that extra
care and attention wasn’t taken to
ensure this essential milestone for
women’s sport went off without a
hitch is testament to the underlying
attitude the institution has towards
the women’s teams in general; that
it obviously doesn’t deserve such
focus in the first place. It stinks
of incompetence, laziness, and a
disregard for how important this
event should have been.
That’s before we even begin
to tackle the downright sexism
displayed by the staff member who
stated brazenly that he didn’t care
“how the fat girls get home” after
hearing students were stranded.
Women@Imperial week came to
a close last week, and it was a flurry
of positive tweeting, bright and
colourful photos, hashtags, long and
buzzword-filled speeches, and totally
devoid of any of the grim reality that
women face at Imperial day in and
day out.
No-one considered using the week
to address the damage that misogyny
can have on a community, and the
negative effects things that some
people aren’t even they are aware they
are doing can have.
I would like to think that this staff
member, who interacts with students
of all genders day in day out, doesn’t
actually consider himself a sexist pig.
However, comments on a women’s
appearance made in a derogatory
manner and with a vile attitude to
boot is a key example of the sort of
misogyny that goes unchecked day in
and day out.
Maybe if Imperial had not played it
safe with Women@Imperial, and not
suggested we are already there as an
institution when it comes to female
equality, such comments would not
continue to happen in the future.
We need to fully challenge the
poor attitudes to women at Imperial
and explain how misogyny can
resonate in many ways; from an
angry comment over a walkie-talkie
to a lack of disregard when it comes
to organising the next big platform
for women’s sport, all contribute to
the inequality women face day in and
day out.
And to be quite frank, it pisses me
off.
