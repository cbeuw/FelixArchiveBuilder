Chanon Wongsatayanont suggests stress-coping schedules
It looks like next term is the
dreaded summer term where fun
ends. Most of us will have our
exams then, but if you’re a student
in their master’s like me you might
even have them next week. All
in all, this is probably the least
favourite part of University life.
I remember writing about revision
tips at the end of last term but as
this article will come out when
we’re about to head off for our
revision-packed holidays, it will be
about coping with the exam stress.
Not just how to cope with stress in
general, but how to prevent it from
building up by developing better
schedules.
Designated break each day
Here’s what happened in my
first year of undergrad. Day one of
revision, I chugged down enough
coffee to wake the dead and blitzed
through the whole day without a
break. The next few days were spent
shivering from the ordeal, making
excuses to stay well away from my
work desk. Understandably, my
ambitious revision timetable went
to shambles.
Be prepared for a marathon, not
a sprint. Revision isn’t a caffeine-
fueled all-nighter that you do one
day before the deadline (I think that
was the mentality that secretly crept
up on me). Instead, it’s all about
persistence of going back again
and again to those lecture notes,
day after day. To maintain enough
sanity to do that, daily breaks are
essential.
Give yourself an evening off at
the end of each day (or an hour in
dire cases). During this time, just
forget about revision and exams
completely and let yourself shrug
off all those words and numbers
that cling onto you throughout the
day. Don’t worry, you won’t forget
about them. You’re just giving
time for it to seep into your brain
and latch itself there. Giving time
for your brain to consolidate new
memory is as important as the
memoriing process itself.
Meet friends
Preferably your course mates who
can help you step out your personal
revision hell to share some tips
or just to vent on how much life
would be better without certain
modules. Or just friends back at
home to remind you that there’s a
world outside of lecture slides and
textbooks as well!
One nemesis of revision (as I’ve
mentioned in my last article) is
tunnel-visioning where you can
forget what’s actually important
in the course, instead fussing over
what seems important to you.
Course mates will shine some light
in that tunnel and you might realise
that the situation isn’t as desperate
as you’d thought.
I understand that sometimes,
discussing revision with course
mates can sound the opposite of
stress relief when you hear about
how well they’re doing with their
revision. But one way to make it less
intimidating is to ask precisely how
they revised and what they focused
on first. Seeing their plan of action
can help you find better ways to
tackle the topic you’re struggling on.
Reward yourself
Classic grandma strategy, but
still effective. ‘No, you can’t have
ice cream until you help me with
the dishes.’ Revision is hell of a lot
worse than dishes, so why not give
yourself some kind of a reward?
After finishing a chapter, why not
watch a rugby match, catch up on
your TV series or just play a game?
Working towards a goal will make
the going less stressful.
In addition to making your days
more entertaining, it will refresh
your attention span and prep you
for another round. It can be a bit
like a reset button. If you start at
11am and have a long day in front of
you, it’s hard to stay motivated at all
points of the day. And when you’re
not motivated, you procrastinate;
students know this for a fact. So
instead of procrastinating during a
revision session, reward breaks can
give you a chance to clear the air
there instead.
Buckle up and do it
Hear me out before you dismiss
this seemingly redundant tip.
What causes the most stress when
revising is actually the fact that it’s
looming over you like a rain cloud.
The longer you procrastinate, the
more that cloud darkens. The topics
you have to revise just seem that
much harder, especially your least
favourite ones.
Trust me, putting it further and
further into the future will only
add to the stress. Maybe it’s the
fear of the unknown, maybe it’s
the pressure of having less time to
revise, but it’s something that can
be solved by gritting your teeth and
just have a go.
For example, when you’re revising
there’s nothing scarier than going
through a past paper, imagining
how badly you’re going to fail it. But
once you gather enough courage to
sit down and try it, you can either
be surprised that you understand
it, or realise what topic still appears
an enigma to you. Neither is as
catastrophic as you think when it’s
still on your ‘to-do’ list.
But remember, despite all the
stress, do leave out a week to have
fun and make the most of spring
back at home. Good luck and see
you next term!
