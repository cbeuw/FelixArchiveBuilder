A fan of comic books, but not sure which ones to go for next?
Never fear! Cale Tilford is here to take us on a journey through
five of his current favourite comic series, perfect for those
unacquainted with the art form
Comic Books: Where to Start?
The Wicked + The Divine
Descender
Finally free from his contractual
obligations at DC Comics,Jeff
Lemire starts his career at Image
with one of his most interesting
concepts yet.Descender takes place
in the far future where,after a series
of unfortunate events,all artificial
intelligence has been banned.
Success seemed inevitable for the
creative team after Sony secure the
film rights to the series before its
first issue had even been released,
and this gamble might just pay off
as the first issue is easily one of the
best so far this year.
Lemire tells the story of the last
robot in the galaxy,a young android
named TIM-21,as he is hunted down
by those who blame his kind for
their destruction in a disaster that
wiped out billions of lives.The major
events in the first issue unfold from
the perspective of Dr.Quon,a once
leading scientist whose job is made
obsolete after AI is outlawed.Ten
years after the disaster that ravaged
the core planets,his services are
required again when TIM-21 omits
a signal that alerts the galaxy of
his presence.With AI very much
a hot topic at the moment (from
ExMachina to the scaremongering
comments of Elon Musk and Steven
Hawking),it’s interesting to see
Lemire join the discussion with a
tale that so far feels very reminiscent
of Spielberg’s A.I.Artificial
Intelligence.
Never before have I been so blown
away by the art in a comic.Dustin
Nguyen’s work with watercolours is
phenomenal and is a good enough

hilarious dialogue pokes fun at the
fictional world around him and the
wonderful inconsistencies that have
been allowed to fester over time.If
you’re expecting something along
the same lines as SexCriminals you’ll
be disappointed,but Zdarsky’s first
major attempt at writing certainly
provides laughs,although it’s
often at the expense of the well-
established universe that Howard
theDuck is part of.
Joe Quinones’art is fantastic at
displaying the varied emotions of
the duck detective and his super-
powered friends; his modern style is
complemented well by Rico Renzi’s
bright colours,and the work on
Howard’s outfit feels appropriately
retro,furthering the idea that he is
out of time,in a world that is not his
own.
With a first issue packed full of
cameos and clever references,it will
be interesting to see if the character
of Howard the Duck alone will be
enough carry the series in its future
issues.
Also,with the upcoming demise
of the multiverse (in this year’s
Secret Wars event) I’m curious as
to where HowardtheDuck will end
up,especially since Marvel have a
history of ending series before they
reach their prime.

The recent Spider-Verse comic
event introduced a number of
new superheroes to the Marvel
multiverse.The most popular of
these was Spider-Gwen,the Spider-
Woman/Gwen Stacy of Earth-65,
who is forced to face off against her
own reality’s version of Peter Parker
when he mutates into a lizard-like
creature.
Jason Latour subverts many of the
archetypes in Spider-Man origin
stories,with Spider-Gwen feared
as a dangerous vigilante by her
community rather than the usual
friendly neighbourhood Spider-
Man.It’s great to see a creative team
that’s attempting to try something
different,and with Spider-Gwen
Latour has written a character with
a surprising amount of depth.This
alternative take on Gwen Stacy is
nothing like her counterpart in the
mainline Marvel universe–she’s
badass and the drummer for the
fantastically named punk rock band
‘The Mary Janes’.
Robbi Rodriguez’s thin lines are
able to capture the fast-paced
and frantic movements of Spider-
Gwen and her foes,whilst his use
of caricaturistic body and facial
structures works well to display the
truly villainous nature of the tales’
antagonists.Unlike many of his
peers,who have moved away from
comic sound effects,Rodriguez uses
them to great effect,effortlessly
the Silver Surfer,the silver-clad
humanoid is the former herald
of Galactus,a massive planet-
consuming cosmic entity,and rides
a silver surfboard across the cosmos.
As a herald,he was tasked with
scouring the galaxy to find suitable
planets for his master to destroy,
however,upon reaching Earth he
was so inspired that he turned
against Galactus to save the planet
from destruction.
The current arc examines the
Surfer’s past relationship with his
planet hungry master and the looks
at the impact he has had across the
galaxy.Responsible for the deaths
of billions,it’s interesting to see
the Surfer come to terms with the
damage he has caused.It’s rare that
we get something of such emotional
gravitas in a superhero comic,so I
commend Slott for his effort.
Michael and Laura Allred combine
to provide their best work yet; the
pop-art style that the couple is so
famous for is a perfect match for
the Slott’s impressive imagination.
Each new creature and planet that
is introduced seems more wacky
and inventive than the last,and
when Galactus is finally revealed his
entrance is as epic as hoped.
Silver Surfer is a comic that needs
to be read; it’s fun,light-hearted,
and easy to follow.If you’re a fan
of exploratory sci-fi then this is the
comic for you.

Gillen’s fondness of British (and
American) music is what really
brings his world to life,with each
God borrowing their identity from a
rock or pop icon.
For example,Lucifer (or Luci)
styles herself as a female Bowie.
Other gods take inspiration from
musicians such as Daft Punk or
Rihanna,and it’s not often not just
their image that they share–Gillen
writes many of these characters in
such a way that they channel the
personality of the celebrity that
they embody. The series is also
littered with pop culture references
and song lyrics which will be
immediately familiar to those who
have grown up listening to Britpop’s
finest.
Jamie McKelvie’s art is some of
the best in the industry.His realistic
style helps create an astonishingly
believable world,and his work on
facial expressions adds further
emotion to Gillen’s excellent script.
TheWicked+TheDivineis particularly
renowned for its eye catching cover
designs,which so far have exhibited
McKelvie’s excellent character
designs for each of the twelve gods
in turn.
My only complaint with this
series,which I feel is common with
much of Gillen’s work,is that the
dialogue is often too confusing (and
culture reference heavy),requiring
you to be fully immersed in the
rapidly expanding world that he is
constructing.Once invested though,
TheWicked+TheDivine is a world
you’ll never want to leave.

reason alone to pick up this
series.In the first issue,we get a
glimpse of a number of different
environments each of which
Nguyen is able to distinctively
portray through his excellent
use of colours and perspective.
The most notable of these is a
moon where the bluish greys of
an abandoned mining colony are
contrasted against the darkness of
space,reflecting the loneliness of
the comic’s young protagonist.
Descender is a triumph and
solidifies Lemire as one of the best
talents in the industry.I can’t wait
to read the next issue.

TheWicked+TheDivine was
once described as the spiritual
successor to Kieron Gillen and
Jamie McKelvie’s Phonogram,the
Britpop inspired comic series
‘where music is magic’,and whilst
it borrows many of the themes
of their earlier collaboration this
series is far more grounded in
reality.
Set in a world where every
ninety years twelve humans are
incarnated as gods with two
years left to live,their new work
examines the modern celebrity
and the associated fandoms.
Now in its second arc,the series
continues to explore this world
through the perspective of British
teenager Laura,one of the many
hardcore fans of the group of gods
known as The Pantheon.
Most will know the Silver Surfer
from his appearance in the
spectacularly shit 2007 film,
Fantastic4:RiseoftheSilverSurfer,
which continues to haunt many
Marvel fans to this day.Luckily,
Dan Slott’s portrayal of this
character does far more justice to
one of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s
finest creations.Already on its
tenth issue,the series continues
to provide excitement and oddity
only rivalled by DoctorWho.Each
issue explores a different part
of Marvel’s expansive universe
with Norrin Radd (AKA the Silver
Surfer) and his earthly companion
Dawn Greenwood as our guide.
For those not familiar with
blending them in with his art and
Rico Renzi’s garish colours.
It is therefore unfortunate that I
can only recommend this comic to
those who have already invested
some time in the current Marvel
comic universe.To fully appreciate
and understand the first few
issues you must possess at least
a basic knowledge of Spider-Man
enemies and allies.Furthermore,
it is worrying when certain aspects
of a character,such as their origin-
story,are not explained.Whilst
Spider-Gwen #1 and #2 at least
attempt to summarise Spider-
Gwen’s story so far,they fall short
of giving a necessary introduction
to new comic book readers.
I’ll admit that even as a big comic
fan,I’d never heard of Howardthe
Duck until its brief cameo in last
year’s Guardians of the Galaxy
post-credits scene.This new
series from Chip Zdarsky (most
famous for his work illustrating
dildo-fights in Image Comics’
SexCriminals) follows Howard,
a handsome anthropomorphic
duck,as he explores a world“he’s
grown accustomed to.”
After the first few pages it’s
apparent that this comic is about
far more than a talking duck–
Zdarsky uses Howard’s role as a
private investigator to position
him as an outsider in the Marvel
universe.The witty and often
