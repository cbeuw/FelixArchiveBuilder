Drink Tax

News Editor
Users of Imperial College Union
(ICU) Bars will be charged a £1
entrance fee from tonight.
Customers of both Da Vinci's Bar
and the Traditional Bar will be
forced to pay the levy each Friday
night after 8pm. The money will be
collected at Beit Arch, before
customers enter Beit Quad. Entry
before 8pm will remain free.
The tariff is being introduced for
a four week trial period, and may
be reimposed after a suitable pause.
The introduction of the surcharge
has caused friction in the Union
Office, with at least one senior
sabbatical expressing 'grave
reservations' about the idea.
/ C N N has learned that the plan
was devised by Dominic Wilkinson,
ICU Honorary Secretary (Events)
and Andy Kerr, this year's Ents
committee chairman. The change
brings Imperial in line with other
Universities which charge for
entrance to bar extensions. The
scheme was discussed and passed
during the summer vacation by the
ICU Bar and Catering Committee.
The proposal was first disscussed at
ICU Council on Monday of this
week. Several Council members
expressed surprise at the plan, and
some claimed after the meeting that
they had not previously been aware
of the plan's existence.
Mr Wilkinson said this week that
the plan was 'a conscious effort to
improve the social facilities for the
students of Imperial College'. He
added that a 'Happy Hour' was
being introduced each Friday
between 8.30pm and 10pm.
Discounts would be offered on
'certain lines' of drinks he said.
Union sources have indicated that
the imposition of the charge is

Students complain on hours
by David Goddard
Students have been complaining
about the addition of an extra hour
to the college timetable this year.
This additional time is also causing
problems for departments and clubs
and societies.
The extra hour was caused by
lengthening the college day by half
an hour each morning and evening,
so that College Day now begins at
9am and finishes at 6pm. When the
change was first proposed, Sir Eric
Ash, College Rector, said that the
change was for administrative
reasons, and that it would not lead
to an increase in the number of
necessary to secure the planned
number of bar extensions for this
year. In contrast to previous years,
any bar extensions now apply to
both Da Vinci's and the Traditional
Bar.
They further reject the suggestion
that the tax needs to be approved by
a Union General Meeting.
'contact' teaching hours.
Each contact hour comprises fifty
minutes of teaching time plus ten
free minutes.The Board of Studies
states that students cannot have
more than three consecutive contact
hours, or more than a total of six
contact hours per day.
A number of departments
currently have timetables which
break these rules. Civil Engineering
students have found themselves
scheduled to attend four consecutive
lectures. M r C J Kerr, the
Departmental Administrator, said
that this arrangement was inevitable
due to the structuring of third year
options and that it was the only way
to 'satisfy the needs of a number of
students' wishing to take certain
options.
Mr Kerr added that the
scheduling of Humanities
Department options for 1pm
effectively reduced the number of
available morning contact hours to
two. Mr Kerr expects this problem
to be clarified at the next Civil
Engineering Staff Student
Committee meeting, by which time
exact student numbers for each
course will be known. Mr Kerr
added that the College is on a
'learning curve' when dealing with
the new College Day.
The Humanities Department is
permitted to timetable options
during the College lunch hour on
every day except Wednesday. This
is reportedly causing difficulties for
clubs and societies attempting to
schedule lunchtime meetings. After
representations from Imperial
College Union Rag, the Physics
Department agreed to move lectures
originally scheduled for Friday
lunchtime. These lectures would
have clashed with Rag's Friday
lunchtime meetings in the Union
Building. Chemistry students have
also expressed concern about their
laboratory timetables.
