Youth Hostelling
Felix 944
On the morning of Saturday 29
August at some obscenely early
hour twelve members of Imperial
College Youth Hostelling
Association left London for
Gavarnie, a spa town in the French
Pyrenees.
Ahead of us lay two days in a
Union van, including the terrors of
the Paris Peripherique, and seven
days camping, walking, falling
over, drinking and sampling French
cuisine.
After spending the night in a
youth hostel in Poitiers, some
300km south of Paris, we arrived
at the campsite on Sunday night.
On Monday the heavens opened
but an intrepid group walked
upwards to a mountain refuge via
the Cirque de Gavarnie and were
rewarded with impressive views of
La Breche de Roland (see photo).
The rest of us sat in a cafe until the
rain eased slightly.
The next day â€¢ started with a
shopping trip to Luz St Sauveur
before an ascent of Pic dAyre (some
2416m above sea level), the
weather having improved by a quite
astonishing degree.
By Wednesday conditions were
uncomfortably hot. One group
ascended to the mountain refuge hut
from the bottom of the valley via
large quantities of loose scree,
while a second group drove the van
up a mountain road and took a
shorter route to the refuge from
where they further ascended le
Taillon (3144m) which gave them
remarkable views of the entire
Pyrenee mountain chain. Two
masochistic members combined the
walks and ascended le Taillon from
the bottom of the valley (about
1350m above sea level).
After an interesting night's sleep
in the refuge (this is a euphenism)
the group climbed further up the
scree slopes, through the Breche
and into Spain.
The group split up with some
members ascending Pic du Marbore
(3248m), the highest peak on the
rim of the Cirque. The photo shows
some of the scree and ice slopes
crossed in the course of this walk.
During a high-velocity descent of an
ice slope several members sustained
minor injuries too embarrassing to
detail. The day ended with the
group invading a restaurant where
much food and wine was consumed.
Friday was a rest day starting
with a shopping trip from where we
continued to Lowdes. Most of the
group got soaking wet walking
round various articles of religious
interest while the other one went to
Portugal, where it didn't rain.
On Saturday those who had not
yet ascended le Taillon did so, while
the rest of the group tackled Mont
Perdu, the highest peak of the trip
at 3355m. Take it from those who
know; it was knackering.
After hanging around Luz St
Sauveur on Sunday morning we
proceeded to the culinary highlight
of the trip: a visit to an authentic
Basque goat's cheese farm. After
three odorous hours we finally got
what we went for: the free cheese
and wine, very good it was, too.
On Monday we packed up and
headed north to Beaugency, to the
youth hostel there, and on Tuesday
onwards to Calais.
By Tuesday night many of us
were to be found in the Union Bar.
A mediocre end to an otherwise
excellent trip. Next year: the
Himalayas in four days?
If any of this appeals to you,
contact R Richards (Aero 2) or see
us in Southside Upper Lounge on
Thursday at 12.30pm.

"he islands of Indonesia
Emeralds of the equator. This
beautiful phrase aptly describes the
geography of Indonesia. Located on
the hemisphere line of our globe
spanning 3,000 miles of ocean from
east to west are 13,000 islands,
collectively known as the
Indonesian archipelago. Most of
them are abundantly covered by
luscious green tropical forests,
home for a rich variety of
vegetation and wildlife. From giant
Rafflesia Arnoldi, the biggest
flower in the world, to immaculate
wild orchids and from one-horned
rhinos that roam the westernmost
part of Jawa island to cenderawasih
of Irian Jaya, the paradise bird.
Surrounded by the sea the
archipelago boasts a warm sunny
climate which is made pleasant by
the ocean breeze. Most parts of
Indonesia are moutainous with
beautiful mountain scenery and
dramatic lakes and cliffs. Many of
those mountains are active
volcanoes, making the land fertile
and ideal for farming.
Indonesia ranks as the fourth
most populous country in the world
with a population of over 180
million. The people inhabit over
3,000 islands, the main ones being
Jawa, Sumatra, Malimantan,
Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. They come
from hundreds of ethnic groups and
speak around 200 different
languages. To communicate freely
they speak Bahasa Indonesia, the
national language.
Cultural and religious diversity
has always been an integral part of
Indonesian society. However, they
have a tolerant attitude which assists
them to live harmoniously side by
side and form a colourful national
mosaic. The character is fittingly
contained in the national motto,
'Unity in Diversity'. Apart from
language, the cultural diversity
manifests itself in architecture,
music, traditional dance, paintings
and sculpture. The traditional
family house of West Sumatra,
known as rumah gadang, is one
example of fine Indonesian
architecture with its distinctive
horn-shaped roofs. Dynamic
Balinese dances, full of religious
rituals and symbolism, have
enchanted so many visitors.
Javanese batik paintings are well
known world wide. Wood
sculptures are abundant, with
different regions exhibiting unique
characteristics.
The Republic of Indonesia
became a sovereign state in 1945
after several centuries of Dutch
colonisation. Members of
Parliament are elected every five
years during a General Election, the
last was held in the middle of this
year.
The main source of income used
to be oil and other natural
resources. However, the nation has
been trying to develop other, more
reliable ways to generate wealth.
One such attempt is tourism. It is
a curious fact that Indonesia is not
well known despite it being the
largest archipelago in the world and
the fourth largest nation on earth.
Perhaps because of its sheer size
and diversity, many people are only
aware of a tiny part of Indonesia,
like Bri. Encouragingly, though,
more parts of the vast country are
now beginning to emerge in the eye
of world tourism and with its warm
welcome, breathtaking scenery and
an intriguing blend of cultures and
traditions the nation is confident that
it has much to offer to visitors in
the coming years. As one old
Indonesian proverb says 'tak kenal
maka tak sayang', meaning we do
not love something until we know
it well. Therefore, we hope you
enjoy this evening and leave with
a knowledge and love of our
country. 'Selamat Menikmati'.
