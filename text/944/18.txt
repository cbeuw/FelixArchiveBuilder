Shark Week
Can you remember last Monday?
Could you even remember it last
Tuesday? It seems like an eternity
ago. Perspex Whiteout. Now
there's a name. Sounds vaguely
familiar. Perhaps I saw them. Were
they the miserable lot downstairs,
or the mythical, almost legendary
support band upstairs? Who knows?
I'm just a miserable third year; I
don't care about the bands, I've got
to get a J-O-B this year. I need to
earn some D-Marks. In the real
world. This isn't the real world,
young fresher, or possibly even the
lesser spotted freshette: This is a
dream, a figment of your
Government's imagination, a
fantasy, an illusion. It's NOT real.
This isn't really happening. You're
just a pawn in someone else's game.
What's more, you're not even on
the winning side. Look around you.
Do those people look real? Are they
credible? How about him, three
rows from the front, fourth from the
left? Can you believe that he really
exists outside this place? Look at the
lecturer, for God's, sake. Do you
really, truly, believe, deep down,
in your heart of hearts, that anyone,.
anyone would ever give him a job?
This place. Your home, your
workplace, your life. It's mad, and
it's turning you mad too. You're
going round the bend and you've
only been here for a fortnight. Look
at the third years, the fourth years,
look what it's done to them... look
what it's done to me. Frightening
stuff...
Perspex Whiteout will be massive
within two years, and you can call
me Lise if it isn't true.
I'm not sad, neurotic or paranoid
and have no capacity for misery
whatsoever,. With constantly
reminding myself of my
cheerfulness. It became something
of a chore to have fun on Monday
night in spite of that I still enjoyed
Sunscreem, who played a
felicitation and frolicsome set. They
bubbled, they frothed, they broke
new ground in a milkshake volcano.
Were you there? D'you get some
techno in your soul? Or were you
just too fuckin' grim? Some freshers 'enjoying' themselves.
Sunscreem, that annoying little blonde woman (slight return)
What is the point? You had fun,
didn't you? They were fun, weren't
they? What more do you want?
The songs were there. 'Gradually
Learning', 'Searching' and the
tribute 'Jonathan, Jonathan'. Even
their cover version of the Fred's
'Deeply Dippy'. I had fun. They
were fun. But there should be more.
A one dimensional group that
provides simple entertainment is
fine, as far as it goes. But add to
that an intuitive sense of timing, the
ability to captivate an audience.
What more can say, very little as
a matter of fact. This is the
problem, with spending an entire
summer in Portsmouth where the
most interesting thing that happened
all summer was the filming of a few
episodes of Mr Bean on the
seafront.
Oh, by the way, their version of
The Fred's 'Deeply Dippy' was
splendid.

Perspex Whiteout: Lise Yates
Sunscreem: Mr Spoons
The Rockingbirds: Peb
The Nutty Boys: Mav
The Nutty Boys: well, it beats me
as to what they were like. I went
and had a kebab five minutes before
they came on, and consequently
missed the whole gig. Still, from
what I heard, the performance was
"interesting" to say the least. All
the Madness fans I spoke to gave
favourable reports, so it seems
pretty fair to say it was a decent gig.
But then I'm not a Madness fan, so
I would've probably hated it
anyway.

Strange but True
N o l : The Rockingbirds
Alan Tyler, lead vocalist and
virtuoso acoustic guitar player is
none other than our friendly
deputy president, Rick Bilby.
Rick has been leading this
secret double life for some time
now, but was unavailable for
comment after their
performance on Friday night.
Boris, ace theatre reviewer for
trend-setting student newspaper
Felix plays drums (remember
the wasted looking one at the
back), making the whole affair
nice and friendly.
Rumours that last year's ICU
president, one Zoe Hellinger
(tea-leaf extraodinaire), plays
bass for the leading country and
western combo are almost
completely without foundation.
