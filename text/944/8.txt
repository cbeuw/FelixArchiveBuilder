16th October 1992 Felix 944
Beit
Back
Fed up with how predictable
everything comes to be? Tired of
seeing the same things the same
way? Been with the same
boy/girlfriend so long and feel it's
just routine?
Would you like to feel sounds,
hear colours smash down the
inhibiting barriers of our paranoid
ego? Well, how about 8 to 12 hours
of experiencing the world in a
totally new way? Find out your
partner is full of uncovered secrets,
experience life-death-rebirth,
remove conditioned limits from
your mind.
It seems this is the power of
Acid—yeah, L S D . Oh my gosh!
Drug! Danger, loss of control,
hospital, psychotherapy! If these
come to your mind, the System has
done a good job on you: you are a
reasonable, responsible person.
You need not know any further
facts. 'Hard' drug, poison, prison,
no job!
How is it a tasteless, colourless
liquid with no smell feared in such
a way? Forty micrograms only for
an average trip, over 600 for fusion
with the universe, metaphysical
experience. No addiction, no
dependency, never heard of any
overdose. One drop on a cube of
sugar and after half an hour, off into
psychedelia for the day. If you
know how to do it, you've got a
good friend with you to help in case
of a bad trip. No risk of doing the
one-in-a-million act of trying to fly
out a window or chopping your own
leg off.
If they can't offer you a
satisfying, intense life outside, what
right have they of holding you from
searching? Oh, it's O K if you find
ecstasy in Church or in a political
rally of the majority, but not if you
alter your consciousness with
mushrooms or pills, however
responsible you are about it. So
some guy sells you badly
synthesized crap in a backroom and
you slowly poison yourself. You
see, the System was right! It IS
dangerous!
Pure L S D to this day has been
found harmless, though extremely
powerful. Most research was
terminated in the 60s when Uncle
Sam decided the substance was to
be banned by all who followed. It
was found the drug was some sort
of miracle cure for all sorts of
mental and emotional disorders. Its
peculiar effects on sense of time,
sequence and limitations were
noticed in how it fnade learning so
much faster and easier.
This is not some fanatic trying to
push people to try acid, ecstasy,
mushrooms, peyote, D M T or
licking rain-forest toads. I have not
yet tried the stuff myself.
But I see that the American
Native Church has been using
psychedelic cactus extracts for
documented hundreds of years, or
that doctors in psychology Timothy
Leary and Richard Alpert (read
their books if you find them!) were
thrown out of Harvard in the 60s on
some bogus excuse because they
were announcing how great the
stuff was (they had both taken it
over 300 times and Leary's kids a
few).
The nineties are seriously
misinformed (and disinformed!)
about psychedelics, one reason
being that there is almost no legal
research on the substances (except
possibly for the army). I would only
like people to get their heads out of
the sand and read up on acid
personally—real medical research
and first-hand accounts of trips
And maybe someone could tell
me why the whisky-drinking
middle-aged rulers and their
alcoholic supporters have put the lid
on such a remarkable discovery as
LSD.
Just remember—if you try it,
keep safe: don't add credit to their
hypocrisy. Use it better than they
use booze, cars or money. Your
Mind belongs to you.
