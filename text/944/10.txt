TIDDLYWINKS
The first RAG event of the year was
a storming success with over 200
students taking part in the
Tiddlywinks Down Oxford Street.
Everyone had an ace time (despite
bomb scares shutting down Oxford
Circus) and we raised over £2,000.
The day started outside Southside
Halls of Residence with a deafening
'Wakey Wakey Southside' led by
Rachel ' R A G Chair' Mountford.
This was followed by Boomalakas
and Kangelas from the CCU's
before everyone was ferried by
minibus to opposite ends of Oxford
Street. Armed only with R A G cans
and tiddlywinks our intrepid
tiddlywinkers tiddled their way
down Oxford Street and Regent
Street (the leaders making a small
detour to avoid a bomb at Oxford
Circus) to Eros in Piccadilly Circus.
Shoppers and tourists alike were
shocked into handing over loadsa
dosh, happily making our
treasurer's job a long and difficult
one.
Three of the C C U inviolate
mascots, Jez, Bo and Clem,
accompanied us on our travels and
were there to welcome collectors at
Eros. As if the day hadn't already
been silly enough it was not over
yet. Once all the cans had been
collected a giant Ring-a-Ring-?-
Roses around Eros was undertaken
and successfully carried out.
Tradition states that after dragging
everyone out of bed on the Saturday
of Freshers week so early in the
morning, the Rag Chair deserves to
be taught a lesson. This normally
involves been thrown in the
fountain at Eros. As the fountain is
currently boarded up Rachel
seemed to be confident of remaining
dry. However the ever resourceful
C C U exec's managed to find
various suitable receptacles to
ensure a thorough soaking thanks to
a handy dustbin and various
cooking pots from Dunkin Donuts.
After all that hard(?) work
everyone felt a drink was well in
order and before you could say
'Drink A Pub Dry' the minibuses
had delivered everyone to The
Teaclipper Tavern to drink it dry.
Unfortunately this pub proved to be
less than friendly so a quick detour
was arranged to The Grove Pub just
round the corner. Here it was a
different story. The staff were
friendly, the beer was cheap and
they even let us put our own music
on their stereo.
The totals arrived late in the
afternoon along with the RCS three
Handled Pot. Winners were
announced and free beer was on
thanks to various fill-ups of the
Three H.P. by the R A G Chair,
Chris Davidson - Union President,
the various C C U exec's and the Pub
itself. We didn't quite drink the pub
dry but Abbot Ale and Boddingtons
were off and the pub shut at 8:30pm
due to general exhaustion and
shortage of glasses. A pub well and
truly broken!
Before we close this history of an
event to remember our esteemed
R A G Chair has asked me to pass on
some words of thanks. Firstly the
biggest Thankyou has to go to Y O U
for turning up and taking part. Also
the five drivers of the minibuses
namely Penguin, Dave Lane,
