Management
Well, you made it. Your first, or
not, Freshers' Week. I think there
were no serious casualties, at least
none that I am aware of. The main
thing is that I hope you enjoyed it
and be assured that it won't be the
last time you will have this year to
let your hair down, not by any
means.
To business, if you have A N Y
queries come and see us, be you 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, nth year or Post grad,
I promise you we WILL be able to
help. My door and my I venture,
the doors of all the sabbaticals are
invariably open. We always
welcome a conversation in the
corridor, in Da Vinci's or anywhere
else you might mention.
From Monday the 26th, that's a
week this Monday, I will be holding
a regular meeting open to everyone,
in the Ents lounge on the ground
floor of the union building. Y O U
are most welcome. Get some dinner
from Da Vinci's beforehand and
come and hear what I have spent my
time on this week, or ask me any
questions. Above all the meetings
will be I N F O R M A L , so don't feel
intimidated by the thought of union
hacks or saying the wrong thing.
I thank you for your time and I
hope to meet you soon, if I have not
already done so.

Freshers' Weeks come and
Freshers' Weeks go, but like small
dogs in the park they always leave
messages to remember them by. To
be more direct the shit proved to be
very thin on the ground this year
with nobody feeling he need to bury
the head of their fellow man in their
dinner lying in the corner at four in
the morning. Indeed, the only
casualty this year is the handrail in
Da Vinci's, which is still standing,
but with the aid of a few turns of
gaffer tape. Be gentle with it.
If you felt entertained last week,
then keep coming back. Unlike
College, the Students' Union
doesn't begrudgingly admit to your
existence one week a year before
allowing you to slide under a thick
blanket of lectures, we're here all
year round. Look out for events in
the Union in the What's On column
and get involved. Apart from
Friday nights, everything in the
Union is free so even if you think
it's crap your grant cheque won't
feel the damage. Along with Smile
Zones and promotional nights we
really are trying our best to keep
you solvent.
This Friday sees the first of Ents'
Atmospheres and the start of our
new door policy, read the ad
elsewhere and please try to help out.
Without the help of a cast of
thousands, Freshers' Week and
anything else that goes off would
not be possible, and so I would like
to thank Andy, BJ, Lisa, Greg,
Percy, Matt, Simon and the rest of
the Ents kiddies. You are truly
charmed people. Andy, Graham,
Dan and the DramSoc techies, bless
you all. The Union Staff for their
never ending supply of patience and
Cathy and Michelle for making it
through without being charged for
manslaughter. My fellow
sabbaticals for something that isn't
clear at the moment. The Stewards
for their yellowness. Andrew,
Gervaise, Andy P, Marc and the
bar staff for keeping fluid. Ian,
Yvonne, Pete, Emily and all for
sustenance. Felix, Jonty, M r
Spoons, Rose, Stef, Chris and Andy
(may your back passage always be
open) for their help, advice and
irritation
And so to bedtime. If you have
any suggestions for events (keep
them decent and legal) please let me
know. Remember you will be taken
more seriously and welcomed more
warmly if you are accompanied by
cigarettes.
Kick off your sling backs and
enjoy!

Firstly I would like to take this
opportunity to thank people for their
contribution to Freshers' Week. I
want to thank all the people in Ents
and DramSoc, who gave their
services free of charge to ensure
that you all had a great time. I'd like
to send personal thanks to Cathy,
Michelle, Dom, BJ, and everyone
else who stopped me going over the
of the Union Building on Friday night
edge (yes, and thank you as well,
Jonty). I hope that everyone who
went to the events had a brilliant
time and I hope you'll all be back
for future events.
This leads me to the second part
of my article - future events. We
will have regular events every
Wednesday and Friday in the Union
lounge. Club Libido on Wednesday
under Ent's control.
is free, with happy hours, late bars,
and throbbing indie, dance and 70s
pop tunes.
Tonight sees the birth of
Atmosphere. Every Friday, there'll
be either discos, bands or cabaret.
Costs will vary depending on the
event, so watch Felix and our
posters for prices. There is a late
bar till lam and disco till 2am.
Future events at Atmosphere -
