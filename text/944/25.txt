The House of Bernarda Alba
The House of Bemarda Alba by the
late Federico Garcia Lorca details
the medieval conditions of women's
lives in 1930s Spain and viciously
attacks the cruelties of despotism in
a disturbing way.
From start to finish, it is a well
written mixture of comedy and
deprivation that was masterfully
performed by all members of the
cast. Dinah Stabb was excellent as
the chilling and all-powerful mother
and the five daughters were
outstanding when responding to her
cruel beatings and strict rules, as
well as when they were fighting
with each other. Other memorable
performances included Susan
Brown as the sometimes saucy
housekeeper and Deidre Doone as
the sweet semi-senile granny.
The Gate Theatre has won several
awards for backstage genius and
after seeing this play you will
understand why.
Despite the slightly predictable
finale and the peculiar if not
hysterical ending to the first act, this
House of Benarda Alba
is a play that must not be missed.

Teechers — Bloomsbury
Theatre
Hot from the Edinburgh festival
comes IC Dramsoc's production of
John Godbar's 'Teechers'. The play
examines the demoralising grind of
life in an inner-city comprehensive.
The cast of five display
commendable energy and admirable
versatility in their portrayal of a
myriad of characters from bored
adolescents and frustrated teachers
to gruff caretakers. A truly virtuoso
performance came from Sharon
Norwood, effortlessly shifting
between characters whilst imbuing
each with totally convincing accents
and mannerisms. She will go far.
Unfortunately hamming out-
weighed enthusiasm for the rest of
the cast, with the possible exception
of Andy McCall as the teacher
coping valiantly with his unruly
charges and an extremely limp
script. Some leaden speeches on the
pitiful state of the education system
were well directed enough (Pilar
Orti) to be occasionally moving.
The highlights of the production
were the beautifully conceived
glimpses of the haven to which
pupils and teachers alike aspired,
the private schools to which,
ironically, the teachers sent their
children. Inspired use of lighting
and some surprisingly good
madrigal singing instantly conjured
an atmosphere of peace and
privilege shocking in its stark
contrast to the nightmare of
poverty, impatience and mass
production that is supposed to
constitute an adequate education.
Point made—could do better
though.

Richard Serra —Drawings
and Dan Graham
Richard Serra is one of 'America's
most celebrated and controversial
artists', although I'll admit I've
never heard of him. The exhibition
is supposed to 'confound our
expectations by reinventing the
medium' according to the gallery's
flyer. Reinventing in this case
means taking a whitewashed room
and sticking a large black canvas on
one wall. You've probably gathered
by this point that I didn't like this
exhibition.
Moving swiftly on to Dan
Graham, another contemporary
American artist. His piece, titled
'Two-Way Mirror and Hedge
Labyrinth' can be found on the lawn
near the gallery's entrance. The title
gives the game away with this one,
the sculpture is an arrangement of
hedges and panes of glass. The
glass reflects the hedges forming a
small labyrinth. What I really liked
was the way the trees on the other
side of the glass had a ghostly
appearance, like looking through
mist. Go and give this one a try.

Opera
The Glyndebourne Touring
Opera —Le Nozze Di Figaro
The first thing I must say is that the
performance of this rather famous
piece was absolutely amazing. A
simple set on stage, bright costumes
and what's more large electronic
slide subtitles above the stage made
it a very enjoyable evening. The
plot is very complicated to explain
in less than 150 words but while
you're watching it is very easy to
follow. The whole cast put in a
powerful and emotional
performance. I was most impressed
by Julie Unwin, who played the part
of a page—desperately seeking love
from any appropriate woman. I
would heavily recommend anyone
who is interested in opera to attempt
to see this production. A
memorable night.
