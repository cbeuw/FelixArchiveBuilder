So you survived Tiddlywinks last
Saturday, had a great time, met
some people and drunk a pub
dry or did you stay in bed all
day and miss the whole thing? This
Saturday you have another chance
to be Mad, Silly and Part of it. The
event is Live Monopoly. Real
people, real streets and real prizes.
Yes, this is not a bored game
(sorry!) and we should raise loadsa
money for M E N C A P .
So, how do you get involved? Get
a team of four to six people together
- Monopoly veterans will already
have started grabbing people so do
it now! And then turn up at Beit
Quad on Saturday morning
(tomorrow) from 10.00am. Each
team gets a set of clues that will take
you all over London and a
collecting can. Fancy dress is
optional but highly recommended -
a large rabbit can get away with far
more than Joe Student. Each clue
relates to a street on the board of
the original. This is especially
useful if you want to win a prize.
You need points and these can be
earned by solving clues, collecting
as much money as you can (rabbits
and long legs.help!), carrying a
team mascot and finally, treasure.
'Treasure' does not mean turning
up with a hijacked police car
number plate or Eros from
Piccadilly - be original. If you can
get an arrest warrant by haggle and
grovel without a night in the cells
or beg your way into a Fast Food
uniform you may find extra points
finding their way onto your score.
Now I expect you want to know
what you get out of it! Well apart
from having loads of fun M E N C A P
have got a storming set of prizes
lined up for the top collectors of the
day. These include a skiing trip in
Andorra, a week at Plas Y Brenin
watersports centre and loads of
other things from C D players to
record tokens. R A G also has sets of
Sightseeing Guides (very useful for
the Great Sightseeing Challenge
aswell as getting the most out of
London) for the winning five teams.
So, it sounds fairly easy, but there
are some complications - to keep
your team on their toes. The C C U
motorised mascots will be out on
the streets (usually its just the C C U
execs!) as Chance and Community
Chest cards. A jail van and jailer
will also be roaming the streets,
taking unsuspecting teams to
random board locations.
Finally, as well as the special
prizes the usual Rag incentives will
be available to those who raise
enough money, hopefully listed
somewhere else on this page. You'll
have a great time and raise a
humongous amount of money for
charity, or you could stay in bed all
day What would you rather be
doing?
If you want to know more, come
along to the rag meeting in the Ents
lounge opposite Da Vinci's at
1:10pm Friday lunchtime.
SO, BE M A D , B E SILLY, A N D
BE PART O F IT
