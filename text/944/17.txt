Goodfellas on
Thursday
From the director of Goodfellas,
filmsoc brings you Martin
Scorsese's acclaimed Cape Fear, a
nail-biting remake of the 1962
classic thriller of the same name.
Fourteen years earlier, defence
lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte)
hid vital evidence which would have
shortened hardened criminal Max
Cady's sentence for violent rape.
, Now released from jail, Cady,
who is a strangely tattooed Robert
de Niro, is understandably bitter,
and decides to make Bowden 'learn
about loss' with cries of 'Vengeance
is Mine' and generally being a bit
(well, a lot) of a sadist. Throughout
the film's 127 minutes, Cady
relentlessly pursues each member of
Bowden's family, with sexual
tension added by Bowden's wife
Leigh (Jessica Lange), and one of
the most memorable scenes being
that with Cady and Bowden's
innocent daughter Danielle, a
teenager who is just finding her
womanhood, played by Juliette
Lewis, alone together. Packed with
suspense and horror, the film
culminates in an epic fight to the
end featuring excellent special
effects. Billed as this year's Silence
of the Lambs, this gripping 'good-
versus-evil' story also has cameo
appearances from the stars of the
original version (Gergory Peck and
Robert Mitchum) for you to spot.
So get into the mood for
Halloween a week later, and let
Filmsoc scare you, at 7.30pm on
Thursday 22nd. Doors open at
7.00pm, entrance is only 90p for
members (membership £ 6 . 5 0
including first film free) and £1.90
for non-members, and it promises
to be a memorable and popular
film.
1991/92 was a successful year for
IC Turkish Society. The members
have enjoyed exciting day trips to
Alton Towers and Leeds Castle.
The Annual dinner with live
Turkish music has also brought
together members for another
happy event.
This academic year, it is time to
join the Turkish Society again. We
would like to invite you to the
Gliding
After a storming response at
Freshers' Fair, we ran our first
Trial Flights last weekend. Saturday
was cold but saw some spectacular
flying as pilots struggled back low
over the airfield from ridge-soaring
the South Downs. All except one
down for Trial Flights joined after
a thoroughly exhilarating day's
flying.
However, Sunday proved an
unmitigated disaster. The transport
broke down and after three went
home disappointed, the other six
FRESHERS PARTY and
ANNUAL MEETING 92/93 at

only to ponder the rain and mist all
day. Sorry to all those involved, but
I hope Jane had a fun day with
Nick!
The club should soon have
another instructor as Sarah Harland

The mountain of Pelion
Although the crisis in Yugoslavia
has retained the 'wave of tourists'
coming from northern Greece by
car, the number of tourists scored
a record and undoubtedly the Greek
Organisation of Tourists deserves a
'bravo'.
Apart from the unique Greek
islands there were many other
places in the Greek mainland which
attracted many tourists and visitors
mainly because of their beauty and
traditional Greek culture and
hustory.
The mountain of Pelion is found
on the east part of Thessaly in
central Greece. The small villages
which are spread on the mountain
retain a traditional architecture
which—combined with the beautiful
forests of chestnut trees—have a
memorable view. The closest city
is the city of Volos and this is the
point of departure. It is a modern
industrial city almost entirely built
in recent years after considerable
destruction by earthquakes. Lolkos
is the name of the small ancient
harbour in Volos from which in
Greek mythology, Jason and the
Argonauts set out in search of the
famous golden fleece.
The unique charm of Pelion and
the Greek province have greatly
opened up the area for tourism.
Throughout the year but especially
in summer, thousands of Greek and
foreign visitors pass through Volos
on their way to the fine hotels of the
villages of Pelion. In the summer
season they come in search of the
pleasures of the sea. In winter they
climb up for the ski centre.
Whatever the season, visitors to
Pelion derive the greatest pleasure
from the natural beauty and scenic
charm of this friendly, smiling
mountain. It's a unique place
because it can combine the quite
mountainous landscape together
with the golden sands by the clear
blue sea.
The traditional houses have
unique features which will impress
even the most casual visitor. They
are three-storied on one side usually
at the front, and one storied on the
other, inspired by the regions' steep
incline. The other peculiar feature
is the beautiful drawings-patterns
around the windows and the false
windows enclosing the overhanging
balconies. The road which leads
through the village is narrow, steep
and unbelievably twisty (a great
pleasure for the real drivers!).
Many British travel writers have
written articles about Perkio, the
place where the mythologial
Centaurs (half-man half-horse)
lived. The centaurs were teachers,
advisors and companions of gods,
demigods, heroes and ordinary
mortals, they were a symbol of
friendly embulience and creative
philosophy, but also vigorous
unfetted strength.
The history of Pelion is very
long. It is full of battles and
invasions. There is the Frankish
period around 1200 A D where
Pelion became colony of Benetians.
The 13th and 14th centuries brought
bloody looting raids to Pelion at the
hands of Albanians, Catalans and
then Serbians. Fortunately, all those
raids were shortly pushed back to
the west and north of Greece by the
then Byzantine emperors
Katakouzinos and Emmanual.
Thessaly came finally under the
unbearable lasting Turkish rule in
1423. The monasteries and some
towerhouses became nuclei for
rebellions. After numerous
unsuccessful revolutions Pelion and
the whole area of Thessaly were
liberated and became again part of
the Greek state in 1878.
Finally, during the Second World
War hundreds of inhabitants were
executed by the Germans.
The following folk song is about
the herioc part the women of Pelion
played during the battles of 1878.
Come out your Turks from Larissa
and aghas from the Kastro
To see the war your subject Greeks
are making,
To hear the Makrinitsa guns, the
long-armed guns
That burst like chestnuts and the
aghas fall,
To see Chronaina, daughter-in-law
of the brave Katsouras,
Fight like a warrior by her
children's side.
To see Souipena, for all her eighty
years,
Carrying cold water to refresh our
heroes.
To see Malioufena, a young girl still
in her prime,
Shoot with her right hand, slash
with her left,
The heads of aghas fell, the bodies
of Albanians too,
And even if in our Makrinitsa the
battle was lost,
Our country has won glory, honour,
fame.
As Spartan women fought like men,
As Soulian women won fame in
Epirus,
So Makrinits's women heaped
Pelion with glory.
