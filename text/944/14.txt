By Monday, all things going to
plan, there will be a large marquee
covering two thirds of the Queen's
Lawn; the venue for this year's
Imperial College Union Career's
Fair. On Tuesday at 9.30am the
doors open giving you the best
opportunity of finding yourself a job
after you have graduated. A wide
range of employers are again
attending this year, with companies
from backgrounds of Accountancy,
Engineering, Scientific Research,
Oil, Banking, Computer
Software.. .and others. The
employers are here, not to interview
you, but for you to interview them.
They will not be making any
judgement upon you, but are here
for you to decide which career
would best suit you. Or maybe you
have already made up your mind as
to the field of work you wish to go
into, but have yet to decide upon a
company. •• -
The fair is open on both Tuesday
and Wednesday of next week from
9.30am. It is worth attending on
both days, as some companies are
only coming for one day as can be
seen by the stand layout to the right.
Most of the companies will have
brochures and application forms at
their stands; these can be taken
away and read at length afterwards.
A list of deadlines of application
forms can be obtained from the
Careers Service Office, room 310
Sherfield Building.
The fair is not only open to students
grduating this year. Any student,
whether it be just for interest or
looking for a summer vacation job,
is very welcome. It is in your
interest to make the-
most of this
opportunity especially given the
current climate where for the first
time, graduates ^ r e having
difficulties in going straight into a
career.
This fair is for your benefit. The
companies are here for you. This
is your best opportunity to find
yourself employment. Make the
most of it!

Careers Fair Manager.
Fair or Unfair?
Find out next Tuesday and Wednesday on the Queen's Lawn
The IC Careers Fair is different
from many of the other Careers
Fairs you may experience. Firstly,
it is attended by employers who are
particularly interested in meeting
students, graduates and
postgraduates from Imperial
College. Secondly, it is situated on
the Queen's Lawn in the heart of
College and so is immediately
accessible to us all. And thirdly, it
is not so crowded that you have to
wait for ages for a discussion with
an employer. So you have no
excuse for not turning up.
Do your prep
Preparation is all important! Think
about how you can get the most
from the two days, what you need
to say to impress employers, and
what you want to learn from them.
And homework
Do some homework by reading up
about the organisations which are
attending. You can get quick
information from the various
employer directories such as
ROGET, G O and GET, available
from the IC Careers Service,
Sherfield—room 310. And read the
excellent Careers Fair brochure.
Clueless?
If you haven't a clue what you want
to do, now is the time to start
thinking seriously about yourself.
What are your particular interests,
abilities, skills and values? What do
you enjoy doing and what are you
good at? The Careers Service has
two computer aided careers
guidance systems, G R A D S C O P E
and PROSPECT, which may help,
and there are also work books you
can go through on your own.
Interests, Abilities, Skills and
Values
These are the interests you have
such as in engineering or science,
managerial or administrative,
literary or verbal. Your abilities
such as problem-solving, numeracy
or social confidence. Your skills
such as designing, planning or
analysing. And your values such as
independence, variety or security.
Occupations
You may wish to remain with your
degree discipline or to think about
a different career. There are a wide
range to choose from—Engineering
to Education, Science to Selling and
Accountancy to Zoo Keeping.
Match your personal qualities with
what you are good at and enjoy
doing and so choose an occupation.
Employers
Once you've sorted out who you
are, and what sort of occupation
you are seeking, you can begin to
market yourself to potential
employers. Approach each one as
if they were your chosen, ideal and
preferred employer. Be
enthusiastic, it is infectious and you
will be remembered.
Your questions
Prepare a few questions to get you
started with each one. What
opportunities do you have for a
****ist? Can I get Chartered
Engineering status with your
company? Do you prefer
postgraduates for any of your
vacancies? At which location do
most graduates start? What are the
career development prospects? Is a
foreign language important? What
travel is necessary in the U K or
abroad? Why do you like working
for Intergalactic Industries?
Their questions
Be prepared for employers to take
an interest in ypu and expect some
probing questions. What sort of
work are you seeking? Why are you
interested in us? How is your
degree course going? What is your
most significant achievement at
College? What have you learnt
about yourself during your studies?
What are your strengths? And
weaknesses? What do you mean by
a management career?
And finally
The IC Careers Fair should help
you to start on your career search.
You may even end up joining one
of the employers you meet. Give
yourself a flying start by good
preparation. And if you need some
advice, call at the IC Careers
Service Stand at the Careers Fair.

IC Careers Service.
