The K-Creative—Question
Everything Done
I'm worried. I can see it all now is
clinging lycra and crumpled shell
suit. A little boutique somewhere
along Oxford Street. The nose-
bleed Belgian 'ardcore ceases. They
play a mellow track. Still up front,
still trendy. After all if they play it
on Kiss Fm it must be good.
Problem is, nobody listens, ever.
Massive Attack's 'Blue Lines'
springs to mind. Remembered for
the dancy, charty 'Unfinished
Sympathy', not the masterful excess
of 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. It is
so refreshing to hear a group with
Style but not A Style. Its not that
trends are a problem, some of the
people that follow them like sheep
are.
This is not a masterpiece. Rather
it is the start of what should be a
rather momentous career.

have some money-off
vouchers kickin' around the office
if you want one. K-Creative play
Queen Mary College tomorrow,
South Bank Uni on Thursday and
U C L on 30th.
Neneh Cherry—Money Love Radiohead —Creep ep
Strange words Money and Love put
together yet many say they are
inseparable, an interesting view
(OK, I'll cut the crap). Getting back
to the record, the tune didn't even
stick in my head which makes me
either deaf or the song average
(possibly both!). That being said, I
seem to remember hearing it on
M T V a few times so it can't be (or
can it?). Anyway, it sure doesn't
pack it like 'Raw like Sushi's' (the
last album) songs did. Not specially
cherishable stuff (ARRG).

• Out now on Circa. The album
'Homebrew' is released on October
26.
When I played this ep I thought it
was so good that I rushed out to buy
it, before I realised that I already
had it, so I didn't need to buy it. So
I came back and played it again. It
started off mellow with 'creep' and
iurgee' so I lit some incense and
mellowed out before jumping
around the room when 'Inside My
Head' and 'Million Dollar
Question' came on.
'Million Dollar Question' was my
fave track—slightly reminiscent of
the Stuffies whilst still remaining
original and fresh.
This ep is excellent—get it.

Suzanne Vega: 99.9F
I'd like to say I hated it, you'd like
to hear I hated it and.. .1 enjoyed it
(sorry). Sure, it wasn't raptures of
ecstatic delight, but that's not what
the album's all about anyway. It's
a calm record and it makes a change
from 'In the corner of the corner,
ther's a corner that's a corner'
(a.k.a. 'Tom's Diner'). The
acoustic guitar has replaced the
drum machine and Suzanne's voice
has replaced the sampled vocals. So
much for the style, what about the
content? Well, as always, it ranges
from mediocre to not bad. Nothing
mind blowing but nothing you'd
have to fast forwards past
(especially difficult on a vinyl). I
especially enjoyed 'Fat man and
dancing Girl' and 'In Liverpool'
that being the first single released
from the album. The kind of record
you fall asleep to, but in a pleasant
slumber rather than a bored snooze.

The 4 Of Us —Man Alive
This is the first release by Irish band
The 4 Of Us for two years—their
last ep 'Baby Jesus' reached the the
top 3 in the Irish charts. They've
just completed a short U K tour and
had a few gigs in the US before that.
'Man Alive' is the title single from
their new album which will be
released shortly.
The album version (on the B side)
is catchy and lyrical and bodes well
for the quality of their forthcoming
album.
The two mixes on the other hand
are long and tedious—the first is a
seven minute dance mix of the song
and the second is nine minutes long
and is just a repetitive sample of the
words 'don't stop'. So you might as
well just wait for the album to come
out to get the decent version of
'Man Alive'.

Frontline Assembly— Blade
If you're after a stirring electro-beat
with no concessions, Frontline
Assembly take no prisoners with
their latest album 'Blade'. This
makes the most severe Shaman look
like a simpering cissy. The whole
is a violent onslaught of the latest
technology, which rattles the bars
of rigid hardcore cells.
However, this is nothing new to
Frontline Assembly. Any of the
eight tracks is fully represenative of
any of their albums—no catchy
tunes, just a concept. Hey! didn't
we review this one back in '89?
If you're a fan, it's another
variation to grace your airwaves. If
you're not, find out why it's still
selling after all this ageless time.

• Out now on Third Mind.
Siouxsie & The Banshees—
Twice Upon A Time LP
Well, what a week this is with three
sinister releases. It was time for
Felix to dust the crypt and revive
the ancients.
So, in the beginning, there was
Siouxsie. And Siouxsie was
Darkness. And then the Manager
said let there be more. And lo, she
created. Siouxsie is eternal and has
metamorphosed to fit her
environment. She listens to what is
happ'nin, so writes The Tune for
Batman Returns. She releases
A N O T H E R compilation and we
adore her.
'Twice Upon A Time' is the
pinnacles of her career, the
melodies that have kept her Great.
The Young Gods —Kilburn
National Ballroom
Apparently, The Young Gods are
great. Judging by the queue outside
the venue, they could well be. Even
Steve Mack of That Petrol Emotion
can't blag his way in on the guest
list, they're that popular. (Either
that or Steve Mack has failed to
realise that he is a rock nobody
these days...What do you mean, he
1
always was!). Meat Beat Manifesto
do the honours as support. That's
about all they do though. No
Charisma. No Presence. No Talent.
No Thanks.
At around 10.20 The Young
Gods take the stage to a wild frenzy
of stage diving and incredible noise.
By 10.30 I have made my first
discovery...The Young Gods are
utter bollocks!
My second discovery? There's a
tube at 10.40 that takes you swiftly
and safely back to Baker Street.
McCarter
The double album commences
where 'Once Upon A Time' left us
stranded. From 'Swimming Horses'
to 'Dazzle' this is the album for us
minions bemused by the plethora of
Siouxsie albums. This is our
terrifyingly serene Queen.
The second disk sees a more
mature and varied vein. No one
could forget 'Peek-a-Boo',
lightened by her toe-tapping
'Passenger' and 'This Wheel's On
Fire'. The compilation is concluded
with releases from Suspicion and
her ultimate 'Face to Face', the
terrifyingly serene theme from
Batman Returns. Buy it and be
enawed.
