MBA Sponsorship
Financial Consulting Services (FCS) is one of the fastest growing groups in the
Arthur Andersen practice. The group provides strategic, financial and
operational consulting services in a number of areas, from business planning
to process re-engineering, from organisational reviews to company valuations
and litigation support.
Research Analysts joining the group undertake data research and analysis
within multidisciplinary FCS teams on assignments of varying lengths.
Thorough in-house training is given in business and financial skills.
â€¢
After two or three years you will have the opportunity to study for an MBA at
a top business school in Europe or the USA. Generous financial support will
be offered to candidates who have met the firm's expectations as Research
Analysts.
Arthur Andersen is seeking up to ten outstanding graduates to join FCS in
