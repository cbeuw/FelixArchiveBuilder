Thunderheart
Val Kilmer plays FBI agent Ray
Levoi who is sent to 'Badlands'—
an area inhabited by 'Red Indians'
and plagued with political
difficulties—to solve a murder,
because, he is told, he would be
hindered less than a white man. Ray
is one-quarter Indian; being
accepted as 'American', he has
always tried to hide this.
The film tracks Ray's progress in
the investigation. When he
witnesses the callousness with
which the Bureau is handling the
case and begins to sense corruption,
his loyalty starts to shift from the
FBI to 'his own people'.
This thriller is long but well
paced: the action being interleaved
with stunning photography of the
region and scenes and comments
designed to indicate some of the
problems that Indians face. Its
impact is somewhat reduced by
often portraying the Indians as
'magical mystics' but it's enjoyable
and worth watching.
Dances with Wolves seems to
have started a trend. Maybe films
featuring 'Red Indians' will
continue being made until the
Americans satisfy their conscience
that they've paid back for stealing
Thunderheart
land by making these sympathetic
films, and stop paying to see them;
i.e. the plight of the Indians will be
recognised as long as it makes
money.

Bitter Moon
An amazing atmospheric roller-
coaster, this movie bounces the
viewer through sympathies,
dislikes, shared fear and pure
shock. Emmanuelle Seigner, film
director Polanski's wife, plays
burning French girl Mimi opposite
Peter Coyote in the role of Oscar,
an unsuccessful American writer.
Travelling aboard a luxury ship,
the pair play an awesome
psychologial game where they trap
a stereotyped stuck-up English
couple into the intimacy and horrors
of their most private relationship.
Oscar gradually reveals how their
experiences brought them from
ecstatic love to addictive intimate
hatred, passing through numerous
sexual games and perversions
(some on screen!), finally almost
destroying both of them.
At times funny and frightening,
the plot takes unexpected twists,
constantly adjusting the pressure
until it is hardly bearable. It
vaporises yuppie-style confidence
and sense of emotional security.
The often excellent camera work
and sinister soundtrack by Vangelis
contribute to creating a strangling
atmosphere. Not for borderline
psychos or sensitive souls...

Beauty and the Beast
One does not expect depth in an
animated Disney film, and
following the tenet that to be
forwarned is to be forearmed, I
managed to expect nothing but
schmalzy tears and predictable
morals, and thus I did enjoy it. The
film conforms to all the Disney
formulae - facile and effective
characteristion, immediately
placing the Goodies, the Baddies,
the Amusing Incidental Characters
and the Tragic Figure. All set in an
over-the-top rustic Bavarian
countryside. The expected and
appealingly slapdash visual humour
is there as well as the subtler jokes
for the grownups like, for instance,
the rather bittersweet advice given
to the wooing Beast of the title on
how to win a woman; 'give her
things like flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to
keep....'
If you want a superficially
amusing and attractive way to spend
some time, this is for you. We all
know what Disney films are like -
don't convince yourself of anything
different and you will enjoy this
film. It's one of Disney's better and
4 t f c ft,
Beauty and the Beast
it's great fun.

Concert
Mitsuko Uchida — Barbican
The complete lack of musical
insight shown by this Beethoven-
medal-winner was astounding. As
ever, publicity triumphing over
mediocrity, provided her with a full
house. She attacks the unsuspecting
resident Steinway, not the
mellowest of instruments at its best,
as though it had keys of concrete.
Uchida harangued us with the
fastest, loudest, most percussive
rendition of Schumann's lyric,
childlike 'Carnival' I have ever had
the misfortune to hear.
She then proceeded to rip through
Beethoven's sonata op 90, which,
like all Beethoven should be treated
with reverence, precision and
dynamic subtlety instead, pedalling
phrases to a matted obscurity we
were presented with a jarring,
discordant mess. What a depressing
experience.
