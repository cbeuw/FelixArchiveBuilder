Price winge
Dear Jonty,
I am forced to write to you to vent
my feeling about the disgusting
disparity in chocolate prices in
College. Although I know the
Union has no control over prices in
QT, it does control the prices in the
Union Bookstore and the vending
machine in the Union Building.
Why is it that just before the
beginning of term there were
MASSIVE price rises in Wispa Bar;
Felix 944
from 26p to 30p and Twix from 24p
to 26p. These price rises are well
over 10%.
However, when you look at the
Bookstore a Twix is 22p, Wispa 23
and Mars 24p. These are up to 25 %
cheaper than the chocolate machine.
Can anyone throw light on this
discrepency?
Yours,

Dear Jonty,
Like many others who attended
the Freshers' Fair I was given a
piece of paper by a person from the
Islamic Society who informed me
that the Union had tried to stop its
distribution. After reading the
article in question I cannot
understand the view of the Union,
if they truly did wish to ban this.
Most of the students who did bother
to read this drivel would regard it
with as much contempt as I did. By
banning it the Union just drew
attention to it.
For those who missed the article
in question I will tell you what was
said. This badly written story told
of a 'sad character' that '...you will
see at every turn.' It is quite obvious
that the Islamic Society have very

call Nobby the Sheep. They say
'...he does what he does because
everyone else does it.'. He
apparently drinks heavily and tells
everyone how cool he is. They ask
why he has to drink so much to
enjoy himself? They in fact criticise
him because his '...social life is his

Dear Jonty,
I strongly resent your description
of Imperial's anti-abortion society
as the 'Pro Life' society, as seen in
Freshers' Felix. This euphemistic
phraseology is grotesque distortion.
Not even the anti-abortionists'
warped and stunted imaginations
could truthfully describe themselves
as pro life. As shown on Channel
4 News over the summer, many
women in the Irish Republic have
died because of complications and
illnesses during pregnancy;
complications and illnesses that
could not be treated because of
Ireland's oppressive anti- abortion,
force of the media and Western life'
that apprently stops Nobby from
thinking about life in general.
According to the Islamic society
when people are down the bar we
should be discussing the '...most
important questions like why we are
here, how we got here or what will
happen when we die?'
Apparently the Western culture is
brain dead and '...Islam provides
the answer to solving the world's
problems in one fell swoop.'
Well there you go, you just
couldn't make it up! How I wonder
would they solve the problems of
the Middle East? Or the problem of
the homelessness. They'd probably
have them all publicly executed!
This, from the lot that treat women
as second class citizens. That, in
anti-life laws.
I hope that the British anti-
abortion groups will keep their
murky fingers and diseased
mentalities out of the current
abortion referenda campaign in
Ireland, something they failed to do
in the past. I also hope that they will
condemn the antics of militant Irish
anti-abortionists, who not only hold
Ku Klux Klan gatherings outside
Irish women MPs' homes, but also
picket Dublin airport and verbally
abuse pregnant women flying to
England. This type of behaviour is
morally repugnant.
Name withheld by request.
countries like Saudi Arabia, refuse
to let their women even drive and
make them walk about with their
faces covered up. Talk about
civilisation. Why don't they ask
Salman Rushdie how civilised he
thinks Islam is?
May I make a suggestion? If they
detest Westerners and their culture
so much, might it not be preferable
for them (and certainly for the rest
of us in this country) to go to Iran.
I certainly will contribute to their
air fare on one condition only. They
they promise never to enter these
shores again.
Yours as ever,
Alan Bailey.
