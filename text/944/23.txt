actor than he is but there you go.
The rights to the film were optioned
in 1981 so it has been on the go for
a long time but literally in the last
few months we have been getting
very close to exercising that option.
They've got two guys writing
separate scripts and then they're
going to chose the best one and
hopefully lever Arnie into doing it
from there. One of the guys that is
writing for us at the moment co-
wrote the script for Terminator II.
The producers of the film are
Pressman and Associates who have
produced Wall Street at one end and
Conan the Barbarian at the other.
They carry the weight then with
Arnie they gave him one of his first
big breaks.
Felix; Will the film revolve around
any of the other major 2000AD
characters?
Roger; One of the scripts in
production at the moment is based
around Judge Death, the other is
based around a character called
Rico who was actually Judge
Dredds brother in a very early
Dredd story. Rico was bad and he
got sent off to Titan for 20 odd
years, then he came back and tried
to kill Dredd but Dredd killed him.
He killed his own brother but that's
just the kind of guy he is. He has
killed both his brothers in fact.
Felix; Thanks very much sir for
your time and patience with us
creeps.
Killing Time by John Smith
and Chris Weston
Max Windwood and Ishmael Cord
are two space/time agents working
for Indigo Prime. Their mission
takes them to Victorian London and
Jack the Ripper where they and
other characters journey back in
time to deal with a greater evil, of
whom the Ripper is only a devoted
and fanatical slave. With the help
of their powers, Max and Cord
manage to continue the trip with
their companions, fairly unnoticed
( as it were ), despite the fact that
they're coloured bright indigo.
Price £5.99
Judgement on Gotham by
Alan Grant and John
Wagner, artistry by
Simon Bisley
Judge Dredd, with help from Judge
Anderson, grudgingly teams up
with Batman (ie. the one from
Gotham City) in order to recapture
the super fiend Judge Death as well
as the not-so-intelligent psychopath
Mean Angel,after they escaped
from Mega City One, naturally
bumping people off along the way.
Sounds confusing but turns out to
be a master piece of fun, blood, guts
and gore. Price £5.99
ABC Warriors in Khronicles
of Khaos by Pat Mills and
Kevin Walker
The story takes place on a chaotic
planet, where six tough robot
warriors set forth to find a seventh
member for their team before they
set off to break their programming
in the search for khaos. Deadlock,
their leader, believes that discipline
and order is a disease of the mind
so, with the help of the planet and
its inhabitants, introduces fellow
robots to their equivalent of sex,
drugs and rock and roll. Good book
- Read it! Price £6.99
Raptaur by Alan Grant,
drawn by Dean Ormston
The story is about an alien which
is loose in Mega City One,
slaughtering people where and
whenever it can get hold of them.
It is up to the Judges to stop it, using
whatever means they can, but it is
not as easy as it seems. It reminded
me of the film Alien, 'though the
plot isn't so complicated or as
thrilling. Price £5.99
Young Death in Boyhood of
a Superfiend by John
Wagner, artistry by Peter
Doherty
After Necropolis, Judge Death is in
hiding from the Mega City's
Judges. ( For those of you who
aren't regular readers of 2000 A D ,
Judge Death is an undead Judge
from another dimension, who once
he had decided that "crime was
committed by the living, thus living
was a Crime '' then set about killing
the masses wherever he could find
them). Whilst in hiding, he decides
to have some R&R from butchering
people and he tells a reporter of his
childhood, before escaping once
more from Dredd. Price £6.99
Democracy Now! by John
Wagner, drawn by Jeff
Anderson
The Judges have governed Mega
City One for decades, keeping law
and order by harsh and not always
fair methods. Judges are the police
force and jury system all rolled into
one, thus they have the power to
arrest a criminal and sentence them
there and then. Resisting arrest
often leads to being severely beaten,
if not being shot or executed.
However, within the city of 400
million is a growing movement for
democracy threatening to remove
the Judges from power. Judge
Dredd calls for a city wide
referendum in order that the city
decide whether the Judges or a
democratic system should rule;
however not everyone is happy with
the idea of democracy or with
Dredd. Price £4.99
I found the that the novels
contained high quality artistry and
that the stories were an interesting
read. Most of the time the stories
were quite blood thirsty, the art
work showing the details to
explosions and decapitations very
well. However, cynicism and
humour are used excellently
throughout all the stories.
