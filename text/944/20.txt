16th October 1992 Felix 944
Pele, Fireworks, CD-single
Pele is not only the world famous
football hero, but also a roughly two
year-old band from Liverpool,
having set out to become heroes in
the music business.
Listening to the single
'Fireworks' I find music which is
mainly based on folk. There is a
busker-like strummed acoustic
guitar, violin, piano, accordion,
hammond organ and a straight
forward rhythm group.
Nevertheless, the producer
managed to create a sound which is
far from acoustic, but which is
simply honest pop, adding even a
quite familiar sounding brass back-
up to the already dense sound
cluster.
'Fireworks' is a lively, animating
tune which surely gets the crowd
moving at a live gig, but it's nothing
you've never heard before. That's
not a great flaw, however, as any
folk music is of such kind (ho-ho).
ButPele's style is neither, and this
is annoying.
The remaining three tracks on the
mini-CD were produced by Pele
themselves and are slightly less
overladen, but they're still not
getting rid of the all-too-obviously
radio and chart compatible sound.
'Moondance' is a Van Morrison
cover version, a rather simple love
The Frank & Walters,
Radiohead, Astoria 9/10/92
Radiohead are not, as is commonly
believed one band. They are two.
The first band are noisy and crap.
The second half are mellower,
although not totally menace-free,
and you can hear the words. This
might not be a very trendy
viewpoint to hold, and probably
makes me sound like your parents,
but that's just'the way it is. I like
to know what is being sung about.
Maybe I'm too old. This second
half sings songs like 'Creep', which
you will have heard, and not known
it. It is (in case you can't be
bothered to read the review of it
elsewhere on this page-Poddy) a
slow smouldering anthem for the
lovesick. I think.
The Frank And Walters were kind
of crazy as per usual. All the
favourites were there, Michael,
Andy James, Laurence Olivier,
Angela Cray, and what's more,
they threw loads of plastic toys at
the faithful after their traditional
slaughtering of 'Funky Cold
Medina'. How can you live without
this band?

song ('dance' rhyming with
'romance'), but in a nice jazz
inspired mood.
Another Ian Prowse composition
is 'Time for Treason', which I
found hard to make sense of. While
the title promises subversive, 'biting
social comment' (which the band
has also been credited for), the
music sounds more like a
celebration song, celebrating
perhaps the Utopian vision
expressed in the chorus: 'We'll all
be sharing our juice'. Good vision
to me, as long as they leave me
some beer. The C D finishes up with
a verson of the almost traditional
anti-World War I tune 'The
Greenfields of France', a welcome
relief from the previous pop sounds,
the monotonous violin and ever-
rattling vocals of Ian Prowse,
backed up by an extremely shy
female voice. This still continues
throughout the 'Greenfields', but
that song proves only slightly
vulnerable. I like the version that a
friend of mine recorded with his
4-track better, though.
Of this C D single I sould say: A
few good shots, but none has hit the
goal, Pele\ The sixties used to be
a better time.

Indigo Girls,
Hammersmith Odeon
The Indigo Girls are not famous in
Britain. That's why they have to
support the Neville Brothers". They
don't have this problem in their
native Georgia, U S A . There;, even
neighbours likeRJSM drop in for an
occasional album track.
Still, they started simply with
tracks from their p'revious albums.
Just Amy, Emily and a collection
of guitars. Very nice but not too
interesting for the average punter.
Another acoustic duo, kitted out
with denim and working boots.
Amy has a bit of an affinity for head
banging, but that was about it. Not
until they started on their new
material from 'Rites of Passage' did
the spark of inspiration become
apparent.
When they added Sara Lee (ex-
B52s) on bass, Budgie Banshee on
drums plus a couple of assorted
fiddle and cello players, things were
looking up. Then we were off. A
gallop through half the album,
stopping only for guitar changes.
The song credits are shared between
the trio. Amy, firmly in the little
known grunge-folk tradition, bites
the heads off jelly babies. Boy is she
angry. Emily is more Joni Mitchell,
but catch that lyrical surgery. The
dropping honey only hides the bitter
pill of satire. The subjects covered,
caressed and tossed away included:
reincarnation, Virginia Woolf,
ghosts, the milk of human kindness,
windy cities and the futility of
degrees. Yes, we need this sort of
stuff. Protest songs have developed
from the brick-in-your-face
approach. Not that it hurts any less,
but now you have to think about it
first.
Still it nearly went horribly
wrong at the end. 'Now,' said
Emily, 'this is a song by Bob
Dylan'. Again, the busker
syndrome reaps another harvest;
'Rolling Stone' or 'Watchtower'
madam? But no. A victory was
plucked from the jaws of folk
sterility by 'Tangled up in Blue' like
Bob would have shaved his 'beard'
for. It was rambling and eccentric
in all the right places before it
finally staggered to a ragged
conclusion. We had heard the light;
it was somewhere between blue and
violet.
