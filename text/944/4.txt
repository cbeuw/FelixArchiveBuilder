Pharmaceutical research
company Medeva pic opened a new
Vaccine Research Unit at Imperial
College last week. The Unit,
housed in the Biochemistry
department, was opened by
Professor William Stewart, the
Chief Scientific Advisor to the
Cabinet Office. The opening marks
the start a joint research venture
between the recently formed
company and Biochemistry, with
research concentrating on the
development of new single dose
oral vaccines.
On Cue
The Imperial College Freshers'
Snooker Tournament took place last
Sunday, writes Bruce Drinkwater.
In the final, Ross Matthews was
beaten in a close finish by Michael
Majdalany, who won the trophy and
title by two frames to one. This
Sunday, the ICU Snooker Club will
be holding the Imperial College
Open Snooker Championship. The
event starts at 1pm in the Snooker
Room, on the top floor of the Union
Building.
Medeva is currently researching
oral typhoid and tetanus vaccines,
and wanted to continue this work in
'an academic environment'. Dr.
Steve Chatfield, head of the
Medeva research group, said that
joint research with Imperial was 'a
relationship which is already
showing positive results.' Professor
Stewart said at the opening that the
collaboration 'will create an ideal
climate for the development of a
new generation of vaccines which
could have a profound impact on
world health'.
The Unit has been set up under
a ten year agreement with College.
In return for using College
facilities, Medeva has paid for the
refurbishment and refitting of an
entire floor of Biochemistry. The
company will also pay rent, and a
share of the common running costs.
The unit will be- staffed by 10
Medeva scientists, and it is hoped
that the Unit will expand by
allowing PhD students to assist in
the research. Medeva have also
indicated that they would be willing
to extend the joint venture should
the current research prove to be
rewarding.
Open All Hours
New opening times for Da
Vinci's Snack Bar have been
announced. The Snack Bar, on the
ground floor of the Union Building,
will be open for lunch between
10am and 3.30pm, with last lunch

Bar now open between 5.30pm to
10.30pm. Last pizza orders will be

Monkey
Business
A latex laboratory monkey was
released by the British Union for the
Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV)
last week. The protest is part of
BUAV's 'Paradise Lost' nationwide
campaign tour, which follows a
year long investigation into the
alleged illegal transport of wild
primates from the rain forests of
Asia and Africa to the United
Kingdom.
The B U A V claims that some of
the illegally imported primates are
used to test anti-epilepsy drugs.
The B U A V tour began in the
same week that the Government
appeared to renege on a manifesto
pledge to agree to a European
Community ban on all animal tested
cosmetics. Although the ban has the
backing of other E C partners, the
Department of the Environment say
that they are looking for alternatives
to the ban, so that public safety
'remains of paramount importance'.
