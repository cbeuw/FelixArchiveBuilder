Freedom in a plastic bag?
Emma Keeling explores the newfound freedom of the first female
condom
In America, women didn't like it
because it required too much
touching, but the makers are
confident that British women will
have no such qualms. This
supposition seems to be true as
Boots in Earls Court report that
Femidom, the new female condom
is selling exceptionally well.
Whether this is just because they are
a novelty has yet to be seen.
The first thing that struck me was
the size of the box, which is hardly
discreet at over 5" long and over
3 1/2" wide (bigger than two packs
of cigarettes). Not the sort of thing
that you could carry about in your
wallet. The second thing that
shocked me was the price, £3.95 for
three, which hardly compares
favourably with male condoms.
So how can the female condom
claim to be an improvement on the
methods of contraception already
available? Chartex International,
who manufacture Femidom, claim
that it is 'the first contraceptive'
product for women which provides
protection against both pregnancy
and sexually-transmitted diseases.'
This may be true but a condom will
do this job too. It is also supposed
to be 'soft and comfortable to use'
and able to be inserted 'as quickly
and easily as a tampon.' I had to see
if these claims were true.
Once you have got over the shock
of the price and the box size, then
you have to cope with the look of
the 'product' (as the informative
leaflet you get in the box refers to
the condom.) It is a 7" long seamed
tube with a flexible ring at the top
with a diameter of over 3 1/2" and
a smaller ring which is meant to go
at the bottom, although it is
completely removable for some
reason.
The instructions suggest you
'might find it useful to practice on
your own' if it the first time you
have tried Femidom and 'once you
feel comfortable about inserting
Femidom, you can try using it with
your partner' but at £3.95 for three
I wasn't prepared to waste any.
The instruction leaflet was
strangely reminiscent of a Tampax
leaflet and you need a degree to
understand it. It certainly brought
humour into the sexual experience.
Trying to maintain my tenuous
grasp on the inner ring to keep it
squeezed together for ease of
insertion, when it was covered with
very slimy plastic, was extremely
difficult. And even when you have
finished groping around inside
yourself, you still have some of the
condom and the outer ring sticking
out of your vagina, which is
somewhat of a passion-killer. My
partner said T was reminded of
making love to a sink plunger.'
However, once it was inserted
and intercourse commenced, things
seemed to be getting better until he
withdrew and the whole contraption
came out with him. Not the best
thing to happen, especially as we
hadn't finished. In the end we
abandoned the Femidom and
continued without it; not a very
successful experiment!
Because it is so new there are no
reliable figures on how effective the
female condom is, either as a
contraceptive or as a protection
against AIDS or other STDs,
though the leaflet ventures it is
'extremely effective'. This method
of contraception doesn't provide
any protection for oral or anal sex
as a condom would do.
W H A T PEOPLE T H O U G H T OF
T H E N E W F E M I D O M
7 wouldn't trust anything with a
seam in it. '
'Chance would be a fine thing.'
'Looks even grosser than a
condom. '
'You can't even blow them up like
a condom. '
'I wouldn't use it it has
absolutely no appeal whatsoever. '
'It would definitely kill the mood.'
While your union president had the
following to say; 'A bit naughty
looking int it' !?
THOSE WHO H A D A C T U A L L Y

V A R Y I N G OPINIONS:
'It was like trying to wallpaper the
inside of a jam jar' !
'It tastes of blended vegetable oil'
'Very comfortable and better to use
than a condom but far too difficult
to put in. '
