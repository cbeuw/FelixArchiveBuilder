Appointments for student loan
interviews are now being arranged
by the College Registry. Students
wishing to apply for a student loan
should contact the Fees Office in
room 334 of the Sherfield building.
To be eligible for a loan, students
must be resident in the United
Kingdom, under 50 years old, and
attending a full-time undergraduate
course. At interview, you must be
able to supply a birth certificate, or
a passport if born outside the U K ,
along with a letter from your Local
Education Authority confirming
your award, and details of your
bank account. A previous bad credit
record will not affect your
eligibility.
340 students have already applied
for the loan, which is worth £830
in Inner London this year. Loan
repayments do not normally start
until the April after graduation. The
rate of interest is the previous year's
inflation rate, and interest is
charged from the date you receive
your first loan instalment.
Repayments can be deferred if the
student is earning less than £1000
per month.
Student loans are not available to
postgraduates, who have to find H M
funding from other sources, such as
the Science and Engineering Wm
Research Council (SERC), a major
funding body for Imperial
postgraduates. Several
postgraduates have complained that •Of-
the College Registry refused to pay flk
out SERC cheques before the start f/L
of term on 5 October, despite S J
SERC's guidelines which allow for ajBb
the payment of cheques on 1 111
October. After complaints to their W
headquarters, SERC intervened and
the cheques were distributed by
Registry. The Registry is currently
negotiating with SERC to agree a
new date for distribution of the
cheques.

Department, Professor David
Phillips, said that the appointment
'proves there is no 'London barrier'
to attracting top people'.

A new 'College Watch' scheme
may be introduced in a bid to
tighten security on the campus. The
scheme will be modelled on one in
operation at Havering Technical
College. The Havering plan
includes a 'co-operation network'
between staff and students which
Terry Briley, Deputy Head of
Security at Imperial, hopes to
mimic. M r Briley, who visited
Havering earlier this week, regards
this type of co-operation as a
method to reduce crime in the
college.
Walk-in walk-off crime continues
at Imperial this week, with the theft
of £5000 worth of Apple Macintosh
computers from Mechanical
Engineering. On Monday of this
week, £100 in cash was taken from
the City & Guilds Union (C&GU)
office. The sum was the proceeds
of ticket sales for the C & G U
Freshers' Buffets. In a statement,
Kate Dalton, C & G U President,
appealed for information about the
theft to be passed on in confidence
to Sherfield Security on internal
3372. Mark Jackson, C & G U Vice
President, told Felix that the buffets
would continue on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday of next
week, at 7.30pm. The buffet on
Monday 26 October is unaffected.

Since 1979, Imperial College has
benefited from the accommodation
for six students provided by the
West London Chaplaincy, at 20
New Kings Road. Hammersmith
and Fulham Council have now
decided to evict the students and
renovate the house. Many students
living at the house take a special
interest in the local community. The
students' work includes running
soup kitchens for the local homeless
population and working with
Church related groups.
Over the past 13 years the house
has accommodated students who
have special requirements and who
benefit from the community spirit
that is a feature of chaplaincy
housing. Rev Bill Raines, of the
West London Chaplaincy, has
enlisted the support of the local

bishop and Sir Eric Ash, Rector of
Imperial College, in an bid to keep
the hostel open.
The council plans to refurbish the
property and to rehouse those who
are at present living in bed &
breakfast or private rented
accommodation. The cost
refurbishment is conservatively'
estimated at between £60,000 and
£70,000. It is expected to take the
council a number of years to recoup
the cost of this refurbishment.
At the time of going to press the
council had arranged an Urgent
Housing Committee meeting to
decide the matter. The
recommendation of this committee
will have to be ratified by the full
council. The full council can
overturn any decision taken by the
Housing Committee.
