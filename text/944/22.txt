Mandarin Books have released six
graphic novels (ie. comic books) of
six of the most popular stories that
have appeared in 2000 A D and the
Judge Dredd Megazine. Us being
the fortunates and elitists that we are
managed to wangle an interview
with some of the people behind
these masterpieces.
The man in charge, editor of all
the stories in 2000AD, Mr David
Bishop had a few words to say on
the future of their best loved
character.
Felix; Is Judge Dredd likely be
cloned?
David; Well, they have a tradition
in Megacity that if somebody is a
great Judge before they die they
take a sample of the D N A so they
can clone them forever more and
they keep a big chunk of them like
an arm or a leg and use it for the
cloning. So once he does eventually
peg out or gets killed probably in
the line of duty, I'm thinking he
should go out in a blaze of glory just
because he's that kind of guy, they
can just knock off a few copies.
Felix; Why are there no copies at
the moment?
David; Well we've got the original
and I don't think he'd fancy it.
Also, whenever they try to do it it
tends to go wrong. Dredd has got
a very finely balanced temperament
and whenever they try and do a
copy of him it never works very
well. There is actually a new story
coming out soon where they
introduce robot Judges and their
entire phsycie is based on Dredds
brain patterns. Which is basically
lacking in self-control and humanity
and so it all goes horribly wrong.
They start going round and beating
up on people unnecessarily. The
wires melt in their heads when they
get over excited.
Felix; So you mean that Dredd
doesn't beat up on people
unnecessarily?
David; He gives himself minor
excuses, just occasionally he lets
some steam out.
And his past...
Felix; Is Dredd based on any one
in particular or is he just a mixture
of all things?
David; Well John Wagner, who
writes Judge Dredd, originally
based him on Dirty Harry. He'd
seen Dirty Harry, this cop who goes
round shooting people
unnecessarily, he's got a bad
attitude problem. He's a bit of a
rebel, My way or no way kind of
attitude. The idea was to take that
character, make a city where every
2000 A D
cop is like Dirty Harry and set it 20
years in the future so you've got all
sorts of weird villains and it went
from there.
Felix; Are they going to change the
name when we catch up with
2000AD?
David; Well no, for every year that
we advance it goes one year in
Dredds world too so he'll always be
ahead of us. Why change the name.
It's such a brand name.
Felix; How deeply would you say
you were involved in 2000AD, is
it your life?
David; It's not my life, I do have
a life outside, not a very big one but
it is there. I purchased it for a small
price. You can't just be comics,
you'd end up looking up your own
posterior.
Felix; Do you think the artists are
becoming too blood-thirsty.
David; We-have our limits. We
never show women or children
getting hurt or killed. A l l our
violence is shown using futuristic
weapons, we try to avoid stabbings
and things so that we can't get the
blame for any thing.
Felix; Who would you say were
your target audience?
David; Well at the moment the
average age of 2000AD readers is
16, for the megazine it's 20. So I'd
say that you guys at Imperial would
make up our target audience. The
stories seem to appeal a lot to
people who are just leaving school
or at college.
Felix; How would you then sum up
the comics?
David; Well I'd say if people read
them and had a good laugh, enjoyed
the stories and the art work, we've
done our job.
Felix; Many thanks.
Not only all of this but we
managed to track down the man
hired by the Judge Dredd team to
instill a sense of awe and to keep
up the terrorisation of the citizens,
Mr. Roger Weightman:
Felix; What makes you dress up as
Judge Dredd?
Roger; The money,
Felix; Your kinky fetish?
Roger; No, it's just a fascination
with the character, I enjoy it I love
doing it.
Felix; So you love the power of
being Judge Dredd
Roger; Yeah, I love it. I love the
character himself, the rather
shooting someone than arresting
them.. Judge Dredd is perfect for
our time, he's lasted now 15 years,
16 years. It's a little bit of fashion.
The interviews
of the year,
Judge Dredd
and his editor...
Felix; How often do you do, how
often do you donn your togs and be
Judge Dredd for the day.
Roger; It depends I mean, at the
moment it's like once a week,
minimum so it just goes from there.
Any where that I am needed. We
are at the moment doing a nation
wide tour at the moment.
Weddings, parties, barmitzvahs.
Felix; How did you get roped in to
playing the part?
Roger; Well since they decided to
do a live character I've been it. I
got into it totally by accident. I kind
of think that it is based on me, well
as a live character. They had the
idea of making it live and then they
auditioned people, I didn't audition
for it. They just saw me one day and
said 'Well you've got the chin will
you do it?'.
Felix; So the live character is totally
based on your chin?
Roger; Basically yeah.
Felix; Is your chin insured?
Roger; (Lots of laughter, well these
Americans will laugh at anything
won't they) I really wish it was.
Felix; And the costume, who put
that together?
Roger; It was actually made by a
film costume company. I think they
enjoyed doing it. They used to come
into the office with fabric samples
and say things like "Will this take
a beating from a pleb, or stand up
to creeps"
Felix; Are there any plans to do a
film?
Roger; Yep, there are.
' Felix; Using you?
Roger; Well the plans are to do the
film. M y involvement in the film is
very minimal at the moment as is
likely to stay that way. At the
moment the rumour is that
Sctiwartzeneger is going to do it, I
think he's got slightly more clout
than I have. Of course I am a better
