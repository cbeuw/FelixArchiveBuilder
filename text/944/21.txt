The Family Cat—River of
Diamonds (12")
The last time I heard The Family
Cat was when they were playing at
one of the freshers' parties last year,
and if you weren't there—GET A
LIFE. But having said that, you
didn't miss much because they were
shite.
Anyway getting over my initial
hangups and actually listening to it
'River of Diamonds' is surprisingly
OK, swirling guitars and cool
vocals but certainly didn't deserve
to be the title track.
'Sandbag Of Your Heart' is much
better with anger and attitude just
oozing out of the record. An intense
mixture of fuzzy, feedbacking
guitars and solid vocals makes it
easily the best track. But as an
overall concept there's nothing but
blandness.
Final track on that ominous other
side, 'Tom Verlaine' (yes, a
Television reference!) sounds
vaguely Bfur-ish but with more
angry guitar playing. Quite possibly
the TV (Tom Verlaine, Television)
influence, but too middle-of-the-
road (i.e. shite).
I couldn't help noticing 'vocal
concept courtesy of Polly Harvey'
scrawled on the back cover, and
thought why did PJ 'You leave me
so dry' Harvey associate herself
with such a naff band?
Anyway overall the attitude's
sound, but in terms of potential,
they have about as much of it as a
bottle of flat coke.

Stare—Mood ep
I've never heard anything by this
band before and judging by this
promo I'll be a very happy man if
I don't hear a fucking peep out of
them again! This may have been
pop-kid heaven a while back but
you can only have so many
Kingmakers and the like. I dunno,
maybe Stare are still trying to pull
all the girls they used to play in
front of in the school hall!
Stare are one of those bands
where the few bits you like you're
sure you've heard elsewhere, mind
you the same could be said for most
of the bits that fuck you off as well!
Both musically and lyrically the ep
is uninspiring with the title track
winning the prize for being the most
instantly forgettable.
Of the three tracks 'No Way' is
the one that pisses me off the most
for being one of those Generation
Terrorists tracks. You know the
type 'it's all the old bastards' faults,
mind you daddy did fork out a
grand for this lovely guitar and
amp'. Yeah, go talk some sense you
twats: it's really shite trying to
mimic the Manics!
At various points on the final
track, 'Prince of Wales Rd', the
band manage to sound like a poor
man's Cure but even this is let down
by the weak vocals present
throughout the ep. Maybe trying
sorn,ething different could help this
band (like bribing the reviewers),
but who am I to judge?
If eve there was a band who could
drive me Stare-crazy, this is the
one.

Pop Will Eat Itself,
Eat, Scorpio Rising
Brixton Academy, 10/10/92
Let's face it. Concerts are meant to
be L O U D . When they're not loud,
they don't feel right. And Scorpio
Rising aren't loud tonight. So they
don't feel right. I think that's the
problem. And the lack of dry ice.
And the relative containment of the
strobes. It's just not right, okay?
Eat will pop itself. Yes, very
funny, Ange, now get your kit off.
And stop throwing CDs at me.
They can be quite a shock when
you're just standing there, straing
at the fairy lights on the drumkit,
when a huge volley of CDs comes
racing through the skies. Still, it's
nice to see 'Golden Egg' returning
to the set after its recent holiday in
the South of France.
... And then it all went dark. The
curtain falls, and at last a half decent
light show kicks in to full effect. But
PWEI seem intent on denying their
past. However unsavoury it might
seem, it's still theirs. And while
they give a pretty, pretty
perfunctory run through of all of
their new album, there's precious
little else; to be precise, two from
'Cure For Sanity', three from 'This
Is This' and a solitary 'There Is No
Love'. Considering that they now
have four albums worth of material,
a more varied set would not go
amiss. Are they ashamed of their
previous work, now that the blame
for creating EMF and the obnoxious
25th Of May lies fairly and squarely
on their shoulders? Does anyone
want a piece of squidgy Blu-tak?
