EDITORIAL S O M E O N E T O T A L K T O
" Looks like it's a race between your editorial and dinner,"
said Paul (he used to be an editor, you know).
"What shall I write about, then, Paul?"
Paul kept on watching the box.
"I thought you were watching those beans, Malcolm," (he
used to be an editor too.)
"Why don't you look back over what's happened this
year?" asked Ian. (Yes, he used to be . . . many things).
What a good idea, I thought, and flashed my mind back
over the events of the past months of excitement, passion,
nausea etc. Carnival seems to have strode ahead and . . .
Well, something else must have happened.
The lecture times changed this year from 9.30 till 5.30
daily, and some of the departments used the extra time avail-
able merely to cram more lectures into an already overfull
timetable, causing the two different types of I.C. students to
react in different ways.
The workers just had to work harder leaving them even
less time to pursue any social activities, if they ever did any-
way. The majority of I.C. were merely further put off from
doing anything by having more lectures to attend and more
problem sheets to do, and instead merely slumped back into
their own shells, became more apathetic, and perhaps drank
a bit more beer, coffee, or whatever.
The Union is supposed to exist, to a certain extent, to pro-
vide a social environment for students and hence some of the
blame must lie with the officials of the union who seem to
have done little more than changing the carpet in Southside.
Union meetings this year have been plagued by issues con-
sidered to be completely irrelevant by the majority of I.C. Is
it really necessary for the Y.S.S.S. to spout forth about Bang-
ladesh, Accra, force the Tories to resign, bureaucracy, Police
Brutality and similar irrelevancies at every discussion that
comes up at a Union meeting?
It is, however, rewarding to see that the authorities of both
college and union are realising that I.C., instead of provid-
ing a training for students that enables them to do something
useful afterwards, is just as likely to alienate students from
society and their fellow students leading to critical emotional
strain. The college now has two visiting psychiatrists and a
social worker who can be consulted by students who feel
they need help; nightline has also been instituted for the same
purpose, and if you feel you do need help, for God's sake
ask for it.
This is encouraging in that something is being done for
people who cannot handle their problems here; but something
must be done in the future to make this place habitable.
And that would seem to be that I'd like to thank every-
one who have helped to make this issue of Felix what it is,
and apologise to all those who contributed articles we couldn't
find space for or postponed till later issues. Felix comes out
again on Fresher's day, all articles welcome to the Felix rack
by mid-September.
"How about that, Paul?"
I looked around. They were all sitting watching the Cup
final (except Kirkham, who was curled up in his basket by
the fireplace as usual), eating baked beans.
Paul looked up.
"Looks like dinner won, then, John."
Alt the beginning of this
term a number of simple
posters appeared round the
College advertising: "Night-
line first floor No. 8 Princes
Gardens, Telephone 581
2468 (external) 2468 (inter-
nal). Open 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.
every night". This marked
the opening of a new service
in the College. A service pro-
vided by students for stu-
dents, trying to help those
who, in the middle of the
night, simply want to talk to
a friend. They certainly
don't have to be suicidal or
deeply depressed even to ring
Nightline. The need to talk
to an understanding person
who is really hstening to you,
is something we all get from
time to time. This, simply, is
why Nightline is there.
The article in Felix on
January 28th stressed the
need for such a service at I.C.
With the help of a few pos-
ters, about 70 people came
to a meeting where the
founder of the Samaritans,
Chad Varah, explained the
purposes of his organisation
and its applications here at
I.C. The name Nightline was
decided at the time as being
the most suitable.
The result of the meeting
was a series of lectures, given
by the Samaritans, about Be-
friending, Psychological
problems and Sexual prob-
lems. These were followed by
a forum where people asked
questions and discussed the
plans for running Nightline.
About 80 people attended
this course.
Then followed the "Sensi-
tivity Tests". These were
conducted in 2-hour sessions
with a group of 12 people
each time. A pair of tele-
phones were connected to the
input of an amplifier feeding
a loudspeaker. The 2 tele-
phones were in separate
rooms with one person at
either phone, one acting as
caller and one as Nightline
volunteer. The loudspeaker
Nightline Volunteer, waiting
was in a third room with the
rest of the group and the
Samaritan conducting the
test.
When the caller rang, the
volunteer answered, "I.C.
Nightline can I help you?"
and a conversation thereby
developed. After about 5
minutes the two people were
called back and the rest of
the group made comments
on how well (or badly) the
volunteer helped the caller to
feel better. Based on their
performance on these tests
people were recommended or
not, to act as volunteers on
the nightlkie services. Others
especially car owners, were
asked to help with the run-
ning of nightline.
On duty each night are
three people; two of these
have passed sensitivity
and one has not. Of the two
who have qualified, one will
always be awake and sitting
by the phone, and the other
will be asleep in the same
room, the third person will
be asleep elsewhere. |
As soon as a new caller
rings, the person by the
phone answers and also
wakes up the volunteer be-
side him to stand by. If the
volunteer has to go out to
the caller, then the third per-
son is woken and goes
across the gardens to get a
car and driver and a replace-
ment for the volunteer going
out. Hence there are always
two people ready to answer
the phone at the centre.
Various files containing in-
formation about a number
of social services, are kept
at the centre, so that people
can easily be referred to any
professional help they might
need. Also a completely ano-
nymous logbook of the vari-
ous calls, recording the time
and nature of the call, is
kept.
The calls are referred by
number so that if the caller
rings again he is saved the
trouble of repeating history.
This log book exists solely
for this purpose, the infor-
mation contained in it is
strictly confidential and only
available to the people con-
cerned with that case. Under
no circumstances is any of
the information in the book
available to anybody, even to
the College Health Centre,
unless the caller specifically
asks nightline to inform some
relevant authority on his be-
half. Even if the log book
falls into the hands of an
outsider it would not mean
anything to them as all the
calls are referred to by num-
ber and not by name.
The same degree of con-
fidence is a principle to which
the Samaritans themselves
adhere and in over 250,000
calls they have answered to
date, only one case of sus-
pected breach of confidence
has occurred. Since, accord-
ing to the Samaritans, our
volunteers are of the same
high standard, the chances of
any breach of confidence oc-
curring should be as small, if
not smaller.

Unfortunately the year has
been relatively quiet—the
inevitable lull experienced by
most universities after the
participation-type demands
have been conceded. "Diver-
sification and Representa-
tion" was a rallying cry.
These demands have been
consolidated—we need now
to re-assess our position. Di-
versification needs represen-
tation. Representation has
become committee slog re-
mote from students small ad-
justments to increasing effi-
ciency ICU needs to reach
back into its students. Ab-
stract campaigns cannot be
imposed without the germs
of spontaneity from you.
Student representation has
not meant real participation.
The most that representa-
tion on such as the Board of
Studies Governing Body
achieves is information—and
then only on that business
which has not been hived off
to be decided elsewhere.
(Deans etc.). THE DAN-
GERS OF REPRESENTA-
TION CANNOT BE OVER-
STRESSED. It appears as
though ICU has been involv-
ed in the real decision mak-
ing—THIS IS NOT TRUE
—power lies elsewhere, not
on our committees — our
strength lies in the union.
ICU must not deceive itself
into thinking it is participat-
ing or into becoming identi-
fied with the establishment.
Further, the student reps are
implicated in committee de-
cisions and can easily come
to identify with those deci-
sions arrived at by sweet
reason, which are against
the student interests. Para-
doxically the withdrawal of
representation is a powerful
weapon in a conflict situa-
tion but 50 per cent repre-
sentation is a further realis-
tic demand.
The Union can be outvot-
ed by the forces of reaction
and must rely totally on the
commitment and involve-
ment of its members. De-
bating chambers, "negotia-
tions"—these are their
forces and not ours. People
are just not swayed by pure
"reasoned argument" in a
political situation such as is
bound to exist within a col-
lege.
On a very basic level ICU
needs to develop a set of
principles, a guiding philoso-
phy. The purpose of a stu-
dent union is not just the
satisfaction of social and
welfare needs but to repre-
sent its members in the col-
lege and outside. Bureau-
cracy is not enough—it runs
away with itself. The only
hope for any union is to in-
volve lots of committed
people. At present there is
an over-reliance on the Pre-
sident—there should be more
action at the UGMs—yet few
motions come from ordinary
members and subsequently
there is insufficient identifica-
tion or involvement. Man-
dates from below not above!
College affairs are no long-
er as clear cut and the main
debates have been on South
Africa, Academic Discipline,
December 8th, Dr. Pain. The
Dec. 8th "debate" at least
proved that it's those who
want to avoid free discussion
that use standing orders, per-
sonal attack, etc. The con-
frontation tactics of the
YSSS group at least provok-
ed controversy but again
their opponents just hurled
abuse instead of discussing
the motions. Never say "the
left" are undemocratic—they
don't shout down the
speakers.
One of the few interesting
results of the election cam-
paign was Pete Lambert's
principled platform (his sub-
sequent dismissal) and his
200 supporters. Otherwise,
the elections were a retreat
into bureaucracy and an
avoidance of the problems,
It will be more difficult to
raise commitment next year
and the college knows it.
Socsoc has failed this year
and next year will be a re-
gression for: ICU unless a
lead is taken by them at Un-
ion meetings.
