THE ALPS
B y D e n n i s D i c k s
In one way or another, the Swiss contrive to get you past
the mountain barriers which ring their land. Here, it's a
tangled skyway carrying you over the snows;there, it's a five-
mile gallery through ponderous rock. At Kandersteg, on one
of the approaches to Zermatt, a train pulls you, In your car,
backwards through twenty kilometres of black tunnel.
To reach Zermat, you
must commit yourself—not
the sort of place you can
take in on your Sunday
drive. For the road officially
ends thirty kilometres from
the village; thereafter, only
the train reliably winds up
the mountain wall.
From the train, scraping
around a tight bend, you first
glimpse the Matterhorn,
which will dominate your
visit. The Matterhorn seems
to lean out over Zermat, as if
to drop its icy cloak on the
scattered chalets two miles
below.
Zermat has the abandon
of a cloistered retreat. Be-
cause all have made a special
pilgrimage to this place, a
new sense of community
arises. The chalets, ski-hills,
and cafes bring people to-
gether, regardless of linguis-
tic distances. In a few days
you will begin to recognise
most of the villagers, to be
recognised. Zermat lies in the
Walliser valley, an enclave of
German Schweizers among
the French Suisses. They de-
light in large but elegantly
prepared meals, a varied cui-
sine highhghted by local
specialities — dried meats,
trout, special cheese and
breads.
Oddly, the outward aspect
of life does not seem to alter
greatly if you cross, east-
wards, into the Italian Tyrol.
Superficial detail is radically
different: mountain cool is
transformed by relaxing
Zephyrs, Swiss calm is tem-
pered by Latin fury, the
architecture begins to sug-
gest Mediterranean sun, cab-
bage salad gives place to
pasta. Yet, beyond this, the
life style is similar to that on
other slopes of the Alps:
everyone, local or foreign,
has a place in the commun-
ity, this society is frank and
outgoing; and, again, the
focal point of each day is a
grand meal.
With a bit of courage and
a few phrases, the diner
quickly dispels the myth that
Italian food is a lot of noodle
drowned in tomato sauce.
Menus tend to be extremely
large and diverse. Simple
types of pasta are prepared
with ingenuity and care—
and these are only apetisers,
to be followed by fresh trout
meuniere, a mountain ver-
sion of the escalope, or other
entrees peculiar to the area.
Finally, light desserts, a wide
range of excellent cheeses,
and incomparable coffee.
Throughout the meal, the
table swims in light but flav-
ourable wine from the local
cellars.
Cost? The cuisine through-
out Italy, Switzerland and
France is of such quality that
'cost' is an unimportant fac-
tor.
To those who know Ven-
ice, Florence, Rome, the
'museums without walls' to
the south, the foothills of the
north are an exciting sur-
prise. Between the last fing-
ers of the Alps lie Como,
Garda and Maggiore, crystal
lakes whose shores are much
more impressive than the
Italian Riviera: villas in the
refined Italian style flanked
by those spire-like pines,
sheer blue rock plunging into
the water.
Nestled in thevalley above
Lake Garda, Trento, is a
place to linger. The town's
centre is very small and very
old. Shops and restaurants
lurk in the arcades and dim
alleys. Look upward, on a
sunny morning, and you will
see, high over the time-
stained rafters and terra cotta
rooftops, the lustrous Alpine
snowcaps.
Apart from geographical
voyeurism, what is the point
in travel? Doesn't the trav-
eller deceive himself to think
that the communal spirit of
a ski resort or the convivial-
ity of villagers reflects a bet-
ter way of life, some standard
to be pursued? Yes, probably
so, but to evade everyday
pressures, to find communit-
ies seemingly oblivious to
your own son of hang-ups is
surely the best sense of 'to
holiday'.

PARIS
B y T e d H a y e s
When I was first asked to write an article about the few
days I spent in Paris over the Easter vacation, I must confess
that I was little apprehensive. This was my third trip to Paris
and I had already seen most of the tourist attractions which
are automatically associated with it. Such things as the Eiffel
tower, the Champs Elysees, 1'Arc de Triomphe, Notrre Dame,
Sacre Coeur, and the Louvre I had seen more than a year ago.
I had even had a sample of the Parisian night-life when, in a
moment of extravagance, I went to see the Folies Bergere.
So when I found myself arriving at the Gare due Nord a few
weeks ago I was a bit doubtful about what I would be doing
in the next few days and yet I was confident that there was
still much that I had overlooked on my previous trips.
With my experience from previous trips, I soon found a
hotel room near the Gare du Nord, an area which is full of
small and fairly inexpensive hotels. As soon as I was settled,
the first thing I did was to get a ticket for a performance of
'La Traviata' which was taking place at the Opera-Comique.
The performance proved to be 'comique' in an unexpected
way. Before the main performance began there were a few
heated exchanges taking place in the balcony between the
ushers and some members of the audience. These arguments
began when the ushers, who had just shown some tourists to
their seats, stood with outstretched hand and muttered that all
too familiar phrase in a voice devoid of any emotion—"Pour
la service, monsieur". As my fellow tourists soon found out, it
was senseless to argue. The main performance was tolerable
if you were willing to ignore the sloppy production and the
noise of the metro which periodically rumbled by directly
beneath the theatre.
If your forte is not the opera, you can try absorbing some
culture in one of the many museums. As a first choice one
cannot do better than the Louvre because, as an acquaintance
of mine so succintly phrased it, "That's where the art is". For
those who would rather have their culture in smaller doses,
they can visit some of the more specialised collections such as
those at the Rodin Museum or the Jeu de Paume. The Rodin
Museum, as the name implies, contains a superb collection of
the works of Rodin who is probably the greatest sculptor
since Michelangelo. The Jeu de Paume contains a large coli-
lection of impressionist paintaings with such artists as Degas,
Van Gogh, Manet, Monet, and Renoir being well represented.
Once you have had enough culture, you can go for a stroll
in one of the gardens, such as the Jardin des Tuilerie or the
Jardin de Luxembourg, or, better still, along some of the
small charming streets in the Quartier Latin or Montmartre.
While in Montmartre it is well worth while to stop for a cup
of coffee in the Place de Tertre and watch the Parisian artists
at work.
Finally, if time permits, you can take a day off and visit
the Palace at Versailles. If you go on an organised coach
tour it will cost twenty or thirty francs; if you go by public
transport you can do it for about five francs.
The palace at Versailles is quite splendid, but usually very
crowded; the gardens are beautiful and immense so you can
easily get away from the bulk of the tourists if you so wish.
When it comes time to leave Paris and return to London,
you will have to make your way back to the Gare du Nord,
that is, if you are travelling by rail. The night train leaves at
10 o'clock and arrives in London some time around 9 o'clock
the following morning. When you finally arrive you will
probably have spent most of your money and all of your
energy, but, in place of these you will have the memories of a
few days spent in, what I believe to be, one of the most beau-
tiful cities in the world; such an exchange seems eminently
fair.
