IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, M A Y 13th, 1971 No. 301
One of I.C.'s barmaids, Diane, w h o got through
to the final of the " B e l l e of the bar" competition.
FIRE IN BEIT
Those residents of New
Beit Hall who fancied a lie-
in on the morning of Wednes-
day, 14th April, were in for
a slight surprise when a fire
in the first floor kitchen
necessitated their rather
speedy evacuation at about
9.30 a.m.
Although the hostel filled
with dense smoke within a
few minutes, most of the resi-
dents were able to escape,
and nobody was harmed.
Loss of personal property
was slight, but the kitchen
was gutted, and there was
considerable damage to the
walls and ceiling of the corri-
dor, resulting in a claim to
the insurers of over 2,500.
The fire apparently started
in a plastic dustbin in the
kitchen, overflowing with a
week's rubbish, and was
probably due to a carelessly
discarded match or tab-end.
When the fire was discovered,
the kitchen was well alight,
and past the fire extinguisher
stage. The resident of room
61, directly opposite the kit-
chen, Stephanos Theodossis,
raised the alarm when he
opened his door to investigate
the loud cracking sounds
which had woken him up —
these sounds were in fact the
kitchen windows cracking
under the heat. He lost no
time in dashing down to the
Security Guard, whose 999
call brought the fire brigade
in about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile Stephanos had
returned to close his own
room door, but was unable
to close the kitchen door,
which (like all the Beit kit-
chens) has no self-closing
spring. Other residents who
had grabbed fire extinquish-
ers were unable to attack the
fire, owing to the dense
smoke. Teak and wire-glass
fire doors stopped the con-
flagration reaching the stair-
case, but the flames did
spread the length of
the corridor, being pro-
pagated in the space between
the ceiling and inflam-
mable fibre ceiling tiles.
When thefiremen arrived, a
30-yard length of ceiling was
merrily smouldering away;
however, the blaze was
rapidly extinguished.
Where the fanlight win-
dows above the doors were
open (and in some cases
flames) billowed into the
rooms, leaving the ceiling
tiles and wall paintwork very
dirty, or even burnt in places.
The ceiling tiles along the
corridor were ripped out by
firemen and dumped in the
quad, where they caught fire
again and had to be damped
down. For good measure,
they also ripped out the first
4ft. of ceiling tiles in all the
rooms, whether the tiles were
smouldering or not.
Although only one fire
hose was needed, the vehicles
in Prince Consort Road
turned in their frustration to
breeding, and the fire even-
tually produced nine fire en-
gines and salvage corps
vehicles, five police cars, and
one ambulance. Firemen in
breathing apparatus carried
out a search of the Hall and
led to safety Miss Sherwood
and Anna Madellis, who had
decided to stay in their
rooms rather than risk the
smoke However, the fire-
men did miss one girl in a
third floor room, who some-
how managed to sleep
through it all! Stories of 200
people evacuated, which
were put out by the BBC and
national press were alarmist
and wildly exaggerated —
the figure was nearer 12.
After the firemen and sal-
vage corps had departed, the
corridor was left in a very
filthy state, and smelling
strongly of smoke. For the
next few days the residents
had to put up with the filth
and stench, but after a slow
start the College authorities
got round to arranging for
the rooms to be cleaned and
made habitable before the
start of term.
As a result of the fire, the
corridor and some of the
rooms must be redecorated,
new ceiling tiles must be
fixed, and electric wiring re-
placed, in addition to the
major reinstatement work in
Ithe kitchen. Most of this
will be done over the Sum-
mer, thus avoiding disturb-
ance to residents during
exams; which is really just
as well, considering how
slowly the powers that be
are moving, despite pushing
from the Warden and resi-
dents.
The incident has drawn
attention to the dangerous
lack of fire escapes from the

If you think that the
place you are living at is
good or even just quite
good come into the Union
Office and give us the
address, cost, size, and the
name of landlord (also
where he can be contact-
ed). Alternatively just put
a note in the internal mail.
We are trying to prepare
a list of flats where stu-
dents have lived to start a
Student Accommodation
Bureau. From the begin-
ning of September this
Bureau will be run prob-
ably from l.C. Union office
to help and advise students
on accommodation prob-
lems. Please help and pro-
vide addresses to get this
very needful s e r v i c e
started.
News in Brief
Announced on 16th April were the winners of the annual
Best Student Newspaper Competition. FELIX swept the
floor by all accounts. It was, however, mentioned that many
of our stories are complete fabrication. We congratulate
the real winners on their success and hope that next year's
staff will get FELIX an honorable mention. The best news-
papers were those of Leeds and Kent.

Suppose you were in charge of a large boiler house in the
Natural History Museum, and suppose you were exercising
your dog in Princes Gardens on the last Thursday of lasll
term, and suppose, just suppose, you looked up to the vast
array of South Side windows, and suppose, good Lord! that
you saw, adorning two walls, two large signs pinched out of
your own boiler house! Wouldn't you be annoyed? Even
to the extent of a phone call to Uncle Bill? Perhaps the above
story helps to explain why Messrs. Seafood and Stephenson
organised an urgent search of all South Side rooms on the
last day of term, which yielded over 25 signs, including the
property of the V & A , Kensington and Westminster Councils
and (surprise, surprise) Imperial College!
The I.C. Symphony Orchestra's concert last term was a
very praiseworthy effort. The standard of musicianship,
especially in the string section, was equal to that of many
professionals. Don't miss this term's concert on Wednesday,
26th May. The programme includes Debussy, Mahler and
Schubert.
With the retirement of Stephenson, the College is taking
the opportunity to scrap the post of Senior Warden. A new
post, College Tutor, is being created, according to Bill "to
contribute to College life at the College-student interface,
particularly in non-academic matters." The first appointee,
for five years, to this experimental post will be Ken Weale, at
present Senior Treasurer of the Union and Warden of Fal-
mouth Hall.
With Ken's new appointment, and C. Cecil Seaford's re-
tirement as Warden of Selkirk Hall (but he continues as
Domesticated Beast) two wardenships in South Side are now
vacant. Regarding Seafood's replacement, to the first moxed
South Side Hall, a successor has already been chosen and an
announcement is expected shortly. A short list of three can-
didates for Falmouth has been sumbitted to the Union for
comment.
A P L A C E
T O L I V E
By John Sammer
Last autumn about twenty
or thirty students were sleep-
ing on the floor of the Union
building because they could
not find anywhere to live.
This coming autumn there
could be up to fifty in a
similar situation. Why is
the situation getting worse,
and what can we do to rec-
tify it?
Firstly, it should be em-
phasised that housing is a
problem for the government.
Why is this? Housing means
people, and people mean
votes. The reduction of the
voting age to 18 has put a
powerful weapon in the
hands of students. They are
a clearly identifiable group
with clearly identifiable needs
and represent about 4 per
cent of the total voting popu-
lation.
N . U . S .
The N.U.S. is to launch a
campaign at the start of next
session to cash in on the
usual publicity that the bad
student housing situation
gets. At Imperial College we
will be running an accommo-
dation bureau (see elsewhere
in Felix) in association with
U.S.K. Also students coming
down to London to look for
places to live will be able to
find cheap accommodation
around college.
Finally at an individual
level students can help by
making themselves good
tenants, so that landlords
actually want students. It
is a good idea to look for
somewhere to live as early as
possible during the sum-
mer as at the end of Sep-
tember the chronic shortage
of places to live becomes
acute.
