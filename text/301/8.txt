"O.K. Martin — we've got to put together an arts page for the next issue. Got any
ideas!"
"Well, I could write about the college's new electron microscope."
"No, it's not original. In any case, it's got to be something artistic."
"Huh — what do you know about art? I bet you think Michelangelo was a
painter."
"I could write some record reviews, but everybody complains because they're always
about Judy Collins."
"Why not get somebody else to write some reviews?"
"Yeh, that's a good idea. I'll ask Andy Finney — after all, he did mention me on
his programme."

"Then there's this superb article about STOIC."
"Oh, yes — who wrote that?"
"Me."
"Is it typed, then?"
"Er, well — / was going to ask you about that . . ."
STOIC
It's a pity that I have to
include for review some of
last month's albums but
with the vac I haven't heard
any of the new ones Ike the
new Cohen or Stones al-
bums. The ones I have got
here though are my favour-
ites of the last month.
Firstly there is the new
album by an American
group named Sea Train —
Sea Train (Capitol).
Their previous album on
A & M was well reviewed
but I didn't hear any of it.
This one however I can rec-
ommend. The sound is a
little countrified with its
roots in the bluegrass. Good
music for parties but a bit
too loud for late-night (ex-
cept on headphones). If you
get to listen to it listen to
"Song of Job", from the
Bible of the same name, the
brass riffs do a lot to make
the song hummable without
being rememberable. A word
of warning—watch out for
bonfire night crackles on side
one. Recording quality is
"Thinks—Are Tory mem-
bers untouched by human
hand?"
On April 27th, at the Con-
way Hall, under the auspices
of the Defence of Literature
and the Arts Society, Dr.
Martin Cole of Aston Univ-
ersity showed his sex educa-
tion film "Growing Up". The
film is simple, direct and hon-
est. Gone are the copulating
rabbits who for so long were
the nearest to human activity
that upright educators dare
approach. Gone too is any
attempt to impose one sec-
tion's morality on another—
Dr. Cole just says what
people do, and how and what
can result.
No doubt it is this hon-
esty which has got up the
nasal passages of the Birm-
ingham Education Commit-
good—recorded in London
by George Martin.
Oh yes! They've got a
fiddle player named Richard
Greene who does a couple of
good country tunes and the
old (Old) Orange Blossom
Special. Don't buy it for
O.B.S. though but the rest is
worth it. There is a single
"13 Questions" taken from
the LP.
Masters Apprentices were
described to me as the top
pop group from Australia
and without disrespect to the
Australians present, when I
heard the album I was am-
azed by its quality. They
sound like Led Zeppelin
complete with their own
Robert Plant but have some-
thing refreshing in there as
well. There's none of the
electronics for a start.
Listen to "Death of a
King", noted for the lead
guitarist playing the harmon-
ics of a 12 string guitar. Re-
cording and pressing good.
C.B.S. seem to have almost
the monopoly of groups
sounding like B. S. & T. But
tee. Keeping facts from the
young "for their own good",
and ladling on the guilt, has
always been one of the first
principles of a "good educa-
tion".
On film Dr. Cole states
that masturbation is a norm-
al, widely practised, and
healthy activity for the re-
lease of sexual tension. We
then see first a man, and then
a woman, masturbating rath-
er joylessly. These sequences
seem to have aroused the ire
of guilty wankers in town
halls throughout the country.
To discover that their failing
sight and continuing mental
deterioration are not due to
self-abuse must be a blow in-
deed. The very term "self-
abuse" oozes guilt from every
syllable—to feel that a gen-
eration might grow up with-
Chicago are successful so
why not Bal'lin' Jack? There
are more memorable brass
riffs ("Telephone") and a bit
of trad jazz ("Bal'lin the
Jack") and a jazz waltz
("Festival"). This was record-
ed in the U.S.A. Unlike the
Masters Apprentices album,
which is hard rock all
through, Ballin' Jack has a
bit of sandstone showing
through.
There you are then, the
titles are the groups' names:
Sea Train (Capitol), Masters
Apprentices (Regal Zono-
phone), Baffin' Jack (CBS).
My best buys of the month.
Finally, if no-one else has
mentioned them here are
some other albums worth lis-
tening to:,
Hooker'n'Heat (Liberty)??,
Aqualung-Jethro Tull (Chry-
salis), Fiends and Angels
Again-Martha Valez (Blue
Horizon), Dreams (CBS) and
Strictly Personal - Captain
Beefheart reissue 99np
(Sonet). More good music on
Breakthrough every Tuesday
night, 95.3.
out this guilt apparently
rocks the very foundations of
democracy.
Finally the film considers
intercourse, and we see a
somewhat unimaginative
couple banging away with no
great vigour. Throughout the
film the importance of con-
traception is stressed, an ad-
mission that at last people
do have sex in adolesence
and that an overcrowded
world must not get more so
—especially with unwanted
children.
This is the first really hon-
est sex education film that
this country has ever seen.
It did not offend me; it
might well offend my par-
ents' generation, but it is not
intended for them. It is just
what the children want, need,
and with a million cubic
metres of luck might just get.
Apart from being a disci-
ple of the Greek philosopher
Zeno (342-270 B.C.), STOIC
is also the ingeniously con-
trived name of the Student
Television of Imperial Col-
lege, a recreational club
dedicated to the pastime of
making television program-
mes. This activity is made
possible by the existence of
a well-equipped studio in the
Elec. Eng. Department,
which the dept. lis wiling to
hand over to the club when
it is not in use, but, in re-
turn, the club helps with the
educational programme. (See
photo above). You may re-
call the showing of some
news programmes in the
J.C.R. last year, including an
interview with Mike Raven
(Who's he?). I remember it
more than most because I
was tall enough to see over
all the other people standing
in the way.
The last two sentences
were, in fact, all that I knew
about STOIC's activities un-
til I found myself repeatedly
drinking beer with several
dubious characters who
turned out to be the commit-
tee. Finally it was suggested
that I come along to the
studio on a Wednesday after-
noon and see what it was all
about. Hatching an idea for
an article, I tagged along to
The Consort Gallery is now
Open in the Ante-Room iln
College Block. The first exhi-
bition is of prints from the
Royal College of Art and
will continue until May 21st.
(The gallery is open from
9.30 to 5.30, weekdays only).
Also in Auntie's room was
the Hi-Fi Soc. demonstration
on the 29th April. Cambridge
amplifiers and speakers
observe the making of part
of a video-tape programme
intended to inform next year's
Freshers about some of the
College's facilities. An inter-
view with Mr. McDowall, the
General Studios impresario,
was in process of being re-
corded. Although it was clear
that the operators were very
familar with the equipment
it did seem to me that a little
creative ability was lacking
in the production. There was
also a shortage of staff, as I
discovered when I was re-
cruited to help!
Apparently, the reason for
the sudden termination of the
JCR News programmes last
year was that it was judged
that carrying a Monitor and
Recorder (Video-tape) ar-
ound might not do them any
good. It is hoped, however,
that next year this service
will be resumed with the aid
of a cable from the studio to
the JCR, obviating the need
to transport the recorder.
In the words of Richard
Parkins, secretary of STOIC,
"We hope initially to pro-
vide a news/information
programme during the lunch
break, at least 2 or 3 days a
week, in the JCR, College
Block, and later in the Union
and Southside. The pro-
gramme would be something
like a visual "World at One"
were used to produce a sound
that to me sounded virtually
perfect.
Unfortunately, the records
which were played in the
main part of the demonstra-
tion were all orchestral/
choral types which appeared
to represent the tastes of the
presenteds rather than
attempting to provide a
varied selection.
Dramsoc staged "Maria
with news of coming events,
etc. Following this would be
entertainment programmes,
some made by STOIC, others
from other colleges.
"People would be welcome
to think up ideas and find the
cash—STOIC would advise
and help to make program-
mes such as features on a
club's activities. We would
also welcome help from Felix
staff on the news program-
mes".
C.H.: "Why haven't you
started making programmes
this year?"
R.P.: "Well, basically, shor-
tage of money. At the mom-
ent we are financed by the
RCC, but if we can show that
we are providing a service, as
well as enjoying ourselves,
we may be able to obtain a
Union grant on the same
basis as Felix. This will
mean in particular that we
can pay for the link between
the studio and the JCR".
On my return from that
brief excursion into inverted
commas, I was convinced
that this is all a very good
thing. If the TV monitor
was placed so that it could
be seen from the Buttery
queue, there might be scope
for some very long program-
mes. Felix might have to
watoh out for its circulation,
though. Still, I won't be here
next year . . .
Marten or The Red Barn, a
Victorian Melodrama" in the
penultimate week of last
term. As a straightforward
play it was bad, as a Victor-
ian melodrama it wasn't bad
enough. It seemed to me that
the entire play lacked fluency,
the star being part of the
props, the Bush, which has
since been planted in a Gar-
den.
"Right, now what do we do, Charlie?"
"Well, we could report some things that have been happening in college."
"Yes, what about the new college art gallery?"
"Well, I've been to see it, but I can't think of anything to write. Could give it a men-
tion, though. What about that play we saw last term just before we got through those 64
pints?"
"Oh yes, 'Maria Marten'. I'll do something about that."
"Then there's the hi-fi-soc demonstration I went to. Must mention that because I
want to play my Records on Pete Clarke's equipment."
"Corruption, eh?"
"Oh, less than 0.03 per cent."
"Steve Swailes sent in this film review. D'you think it'll pass the censors?"
"It's too late for that — we filled it in at the beginning of term."

"I think that's about the lot. Fancy a pint?"
"Why not?"
