It must have been increasingly obvious to anyone with in-
sight that the most stable influence on the British economy
this year has been the existence of Carnival. Number one in a
field of one, this admirable organisation has been a mild
success this year compared with the usual total failure.
While Rolls-Royce crashed and many of the "stable" com-
panies and their shares travelled a weary downhill path,
Carnival alone remained prosperous and enterprising making
ground where others couldn't, and closing to date with a sum
of about £4,000.
The role of Carnival in
British Government is appar-
ent from Edward Heath,
philosopher and politician in
his victory speech only a
short while ago: ". . . and we,
the Tory Party pledge to
keep all our election promis-
es and with the help of Car-
nival hope to provide a
better standard of living to
/ou who most certainly des-
:rve it".
The words of a great man
for a great organisation.
How does Carnival prosper
where other fall? Carnival
is continuously engaged in
looking at new projects and
perfecting the many pieces of
specialised equipment need-
ed in profiteering and racket-
eering. An example of this is
the present research into
strippers and associated
phenomena in the field of
visual excitement (see photo-
graph). We believe it is not
enough to be content with
just taking money from peo-
ple, but to make them think
we deserve it. Fostering such
an attitude requires many ad-
vanced techniques and we at
Carnival devote a large pro-
portion of our time to re-
search.
International Relations
A great deal of effort is
also expended in promoting
international collaboration
both in research/development
and of course production.
Carnival has close links with
LTnstitut Francais and
Maria Assumpta organisa-
tions and plans are being
laid to encourage the more
apathetic backward colleges
in the USK to participate in
Carnival next year.
Prospects
A young undergraduate
considering taking up a first
appointment with Carnival
will be interested in his fut-
ure prospects and progress
within the organisation. The
overall objective of our pol-
icy is to ensure that individ-
uals with potential are identi-
fied and given the opportun-
ity to work in their chosen
field. The individual's own
ambitions and interests will
be taken Soto account so that
his capabilities are utilised
to the full. We start with the
idea that the best way to
learn is by doing and the
knowledge gained through
academic studies is regarded
as a good base on which to
build.
Appointments
A run down of the more
important posts is given be-
low. These are the "bare-
bones" of Carnival and the
number of vacancies is pro-
portional to the work avail-
able. Of course it is possible
to approach the company
directly and make one's own
work. These people are at a
premium and will be im-
mediately absorbed into a
high position. Whilst the par-
ticular skill is not of over-
riding importance the way of
thinking is.
Carnival
Co-ordinator
Due to a recent change in
the constitution the Co-ordin-
ator will be democratically
elected at a Union meeting
(the one after May 6th). This
is a pleasant job, theoretic-
ally administrative, and
mainly involves "delegation
of responsibility" or just
telling people what to do.
Qualifications: average in-
telligence, sociability and ab-
solutely no scruples. Applic-
ants must have a thorough
grounding in oral mechanics
—the art of telling people
what to do in such a way
that they think they're the
only people capable of doing
it.
Salary: under negotiation.
Treasurer
Similar to co-ordinator
with a close involvement in
everything. Must have a clean
record and be able to handle
dogs and a night-stick. Deals
with about £5,000, all of
which must be itemised to
convince the auditors and
ourselves that we're not fid-
dling anything. He must also
be of a persuasive disposition
and conveniently forgetful,
depending on which way the
money's going.
Secretary
A tireless worker involved
with all paperwork, apolog-
ies, summonses, begging let-
ters and day-to-day corres-
pondence. She/he must have
the ability to put in writing
what everybody should have
said.
Carnival Ents
This position has not been
filled this year. Successful ap-
plicants should be able to
talk to agents, catering firms,
etc. and convince them that
they're helping themselves by
helping us at a reduced rate.
A difficult job dealing with
anything from a £2,000
Albert Hall disaster to a Car-
nival Queen fiasco.
Miscellaneous positions
include interesting and var-
ied work on internal (college)
publicity, external and public
relations, rag-mag, raffle and
stunts.
Selection Procedure
The Co-ordrnator is the
only member of the organis-
ation elected by the college
and aspiring volunteers in
any field should approach
him directly after he's elect-
ed so that he can form a
"bare-bones" committee be-
fore the end of term. Every-
body considered on merit and
character.
Benefits of Service
Travel: past work has tak-
en members as far afield as
John O'Groats, Lands End,
Neasden, Dublin, Belfast,
Edinburgh and Cardiff on
paid expenses.
Holidays: 15 weeks' paid
holiday or two^ days in the
sick bay depending on suc-
cess.
Pension and Life Insur-
ance: taken out on all mem-
bers.
* * *
Employees are thus given
every opportunity to develop
the skills they may (or may
not) have, and will find
themselves meeting many dif-
ferent people from all walks
of life. The work is worth-
while and satisfying and
ranges in dealings from Rec-
tors to Crimsoc, from drunks
to film-stars and leads to
qualifications recognised
throughout the country.

Keep 'em on, love, keep 'em on.
O b i t u a r y
Carnival, having been with us for two long terms and a few
weeks of .this one, finally passed away quietly on May 6th at
11 p.m. in the Ante-Room. It died peacefully and with dignity
in the company of a few good friends presenting the "Schol-
ars" in concert as a farewell aot.
This unique vocal quintet were all choral scholars in the
Kings College, Cambridge Choir, and their repertoire cov-
ered some 500 years of English music. They delighted the
audience with a tonal quality and excellence rarely heard: the
acoustics of the Great Hall enhancing the performance.
The concert was sponsored by the Greater London Arts
Association and supported by London Weekend Television,
and provided a pleasant relief from the more usual entertain-
ment provided in the Great Hall.

The integrated monitored concept
Of functional digital programming
Is a responsive incremental contingency
Acting on the optional transitional flexibility
Of the system.
With the total reciprocal projection of this problem,
It's responsive management options
Bear no relation
To our parallel third-generation hardware
With its balanced policy concept
And its synchronized logistical time-phase.
Thus,
Dealing solely with
The systematised organisational mobility,
We have no
Compatible
Monitored
Contingency
Whatsoever,
And have therefore to yield
To the optional logistical mobility
of the computer.
AND THAT IS M Y PROBLEM IN A NUTSHELL.

W h a t a b o u t u s t h e n ?
Imperiol College students, past and present, are in the news
again, with Peter Hain's chairmanship of the Young Liberals,
and Gordon Reece's uncomplimentary mention in Private
Eye. The gist of P.E's. argument against Mr. Reece, who won
The New Statesman's Student journalism competition, was
that he's 34, an engineer, a postgraduate, and brother-in-law
of a regular contributor to The New Statesman. Mr. Reece
vindicated himself handsomely in a clever little letter, pub-
lished by P.E. in the next issue, and he's really 29. Not wish-
ing to be too uncharitable (but nevertheless being so), we are
reminded that the competition which caused the exchange was
for student journalists, and that as yet Mr. Reece has con-
tributed a quantity of copy not unadjacent to zero to his own
Students' Union newspaper, your very own organ, the grossly
understaffed and fantastically underpraised FELIX.
. . . and a final word from Mick,
Leper, K a t h y , and all t h e boys
a t t h e corpse factory
They found him hiding in a corner and dragged him out to
tell him he had to do something about Kathy, who was div-
erting all the traffic in Exhibition Road. He didn't want to
move, but they pulled him out from under Southside and up
to the roadway where the cars were slowed to a near halt.
It was high summer. Tempers frayed in the heat and the
student bustle was crowned with car horns shrieking at fre-
quent intervals.
Leper sat on his haunches at the roadside, white teeth
showing in his usual grin, glancing occasionally at Kathy.
"Hey Mick," he called, when they hauled his friend out by
the Mormon church, "looks like you've got a problem". In
the heat, everything was noisier, everyone was dressed lightly,
moved lightly, commuting across Exhibition Road between
business and pleasure. The stream of cars moved suddenly as
a bottleneck cleared momentarily, then Slowed down to a
crawl. Mick threaded his way between them, shaking off his
escort who went their ways; he went over to Leper, stooped
by him.
He looked at Kathy, and then around at all the people
moving to and fro, going about their business.
"Why the hell haven't some of them done something about
her?" he complained irritably. "She's causing chaos there".
Leper looked up from where he crouched, shrugged. "Per-
haps they haven't noticed. It's only Rathy getting in the way
again; nothing really to do with them".
Mick shook his head wearily. "Do I have to do every-
thing?"
He pulled Leper to his feet. "Give me a hand then", he
said, and they moved in among the traffic. "Where are we
going to put her", Leper asked when they reached the van.
Mick thought for a moment. "Home, I suppose".
The car had thrown her several feet across the road where
she had come to rest partly underneath the parked van, and
partly blocking the northbound lane. It would be an awkward
job, moving her, but Mick and Leper didn't let it bother them
too much. After all, we all have our hang-ups.
