Happy New Year
What was life like during war Daddy, your l i t t l e boy might
ask some years from now, thinking, a s children do in their
endearing manner, that if you are old enough to be their
Daddy you must know about such things.
I wasn't around then, you might reply, but I imagine it
cannot have been far removed from the situation which greeted
us a t the start o f 1979. Take petrol rationing for example.
A s I write I have just returned from a V/2 hour wait i n sub-
zero temperatures at my l o c a l petrol station for a 4 gallons
per customer petrol ration, and I am wondering whether next
week there w i l l be any petrol at a l l . So desperate are some people
that, on hearing that the c a s h register had jammed and the garage
was now unable to give customers any change, a young teacher
in the queue told me that she didn't care what i t cost her so
long a s she could f i l l her tank.
Soon she may no longer need to worry about getting to work.
In some parts of the country schools are already c l o s e d because
there is no fuel to heat the classrooms. I C a l s o depends on o i l
deliveries to keep i t s large draughty buildings heated and the
first area to suffer w i l l be the lecture theatres.
If lecture s are cancelled w e can a l l spend more time i n the
labs. Well perhaps - or perhaps not, because the technicians
are s t i l l operating a work to rule and some equipment cannot be
used. There is no sign of a speedy end to that dispute so it
looks l i k e you w i l l have extra spare time on your hands.
A good thing too for those who do their own shopping
because soon i t may not be so easy to buy food. H a v i n g
survived the bread shortage we are now faced w i t h the p o s s i b i l i t y
of shortages of everything and anything. F r e s h vegetables were
the first to go, when those which were not frozen into the ground
were unable to leave the farms after the worst snow-fall for 15
years. Housewives immediately turned to frozen vegetables
(several p a c k s have suddenly appeared i n my mother's freezer)
and cleared the freezer centres faster than restocking could take
place. Now, with the beginning of the lorry drivers' dispute, a l l
food supplies are threatened and supermarket shelves are speedily
emptied a s people stock up a s if for a long siege.
Milk deliveries may not l a s t long. I am thawing out a pint of
milk which has j u s t been delivered frozen s o l i d i n i t s bottle.
That i t i s there at a l l I believe I ha\e to thank the G u i n n e s s brewery,
who made their tankers available to the M i l k Marketing Board to
transport m i l k from the farms. Unfortunately they do not seem to
have mixed up the two liquids and I looked i n v a i n for a brown
frothy beverage o n my doorstep.
I am surprised that there have not been any power cuts so far
this winter, except of course for those caused by the snow bringing
down the supply liness Some years ago we u s e d to suffer voltage
reductions and cuts whenever the weather turned slightly colder
than usualr When the whole of France woke up one morning without
electricity, I expected warnings of the imminent occurrence of the
B r i t i s h version, but w e have until now (keep your fingers crossed)
been spared this affliction. Before readers become too complacent,
however, do I not r e c a l l that the electricity supply workers
are due for another round of pay talks shortly?
So a s I s i t by the gas fire i n the candle light, unable to leave
home except on foot as there i s no petrol for the cars and buses
and the trains cannot run because it i s .too c o l d , and I wonder
where the next meal i s coming from, while attempting to think
of some good reasons to persuade the Editor that F E L I X really
does need a foreign correspondent, preferably i n a warm strike-
free country, I' try to find something cheerful to say to welcome
you back for another term. A t least F E L I X is s t i l l being printed,
for with " T h e T i m e s " suspended and the p r o v i n c i a l journalists
on strike, there may soon be few newspapers left to tell you
about the next round of disruptions to normal l i f e . Happy N e w
Year to a l l .
