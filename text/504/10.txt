FOOTBALL
IC IV 6 Q M C IV 0
IC started this league match still
looking for their first league win of
the season. Their previous inept
performances had failed to produce any
goals!
The game started with I C playing
with the wind and the team found
themselves i n the unaccustomed
position of attacking the opposing
team. T h e prize first goal came
after only a few minutes when J .
Shuttleworth headed on a long free
kick for S.Marten to score. It wasn't
long before J . Shuttleworth scored
the second and the third goal followed
when S. Marten s p l i t the opposing
defence with a pass for J . Rowley to
score. It w a s then just a question
of how many I C would score before
half time. However due to their usual
standard of finishing only one more w a s
scored when J . Shuttleworth scored
from a through b a l l by S. Sims.
The second half was a much closer
fought battle and produced the best
goal of the game when J . Rowley
rose beautifully to P . O ' K e l l y ' s
cross to head the ball into the top
corner of the net. T h e I C defence held
firm throughout the game and only
suffered one anxious moment when
goalkeeper S. Veats challenged the
opposition's five foot striker and
won the ball convincingly, at the
expense of a lost tooth.
The sixth and final goal came follow-
ing a good run by K . Reeve. He sent
over a swirling cross which confused
P. O'Kelly so much that he w a s unable
to get out of the way and the ball flew into
the net off his head.
Team: S. Veats, P. Walker, P. Lakin
(Capt), K. Reeve, B. Caffin, S.Sims,
S. Marten, D. Brannan, J. Shuttleworth,
J. Rowley, P. O'Kelley.
"Piscatorial
Society
"What on earth i s P i s c a t o r i a l S o c i e -
t y ? " T h i s i s the question most of you
who read the title of this article w i l l
ask yourself. In the C o n c i s e Oxford
English Dictionary, " p i s c a t o r i a l " is
defined a s " a d d i c t e d to f i s h i n g " , and
that i s exactly for whom this club i s
intended. If you are the type of person
who would enjoy their Sundays as a day
on a river bank somewhere in the middle
of nowhere, or perhaps on a beach, or
in a boat, then this is the c l u b for you.
P i s c a t o r i a l Society does exist, and
w i l l provide subsidy for travel for
members, and help with affiliation to
fishing c l u b s . However, at the moment,
it lacks any interest in its running,
indeed, it has no members whatsoever.
It seems hard to believe that within
Imperial College there are no people who
have sufficient interest to help in the
running of this c l u b . S o , if you think
that you would like to take an active
interest in this club please contact,
Malcolm Clarke, Elec Eng 3, or Keogh Hall

think of. Slides don't need to have been

interest.
There i s a prize o f Â£10 for the best

February 1979. Entries can be handed in

A l l slides should be i n d i v i d u a l l y marked

It i s planned that the slide show w i l l be

t h i s , i t i s a condition of entry that college
w i l l be allowed to keep the s l i d e s used in

not to u s e a n y s l i d e s entered, for purposes
other than those described above, without

Table Tennis
Here comes 1979 - t h e World Table
Tennis Championships - a new series of
" T o p T a b l e " and the climax to I.C.'s
struggle for world t.t. domination
(i.e. promotion in the Central London
League).
Two matches were played at the end
of last term, both were 8-1 victories
the firsts whipping S A R A H SIDDONS (lucky
girll) and the seconds annihilating
C R O W N & M A N O R 0(dd)B(alls).
This week l'-m looking forward (gulp)
to seven matches on which to report,
(and I'm in two of 'em!) so expect twice
as much superhuman spiel as usual next
week.
Bye now from SUPERHEWK
P.S. if you see a red and blue blur over
P r i n c e ' s Gardens, i t ' s probably a bird,
or a plane or something.
