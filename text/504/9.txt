(CONTIKI)
A n altogether different experience.
If you're 18-30 and want to see Europe in '79, why not
travel on a Contiki tour, where you can find yourself staying in
a 13th century villa in Florence , a chateau set amongst
vineyards in France, a fortress on the Rhine or a taverna on
Mykonos?
These unique stopovers are i n line with C o n t i k i ' s slogan:
" N o t j u s t a tour but an altogether different e x p e r i e n c e . "
C o n t i k i T r a v e l was founded 18 years ago and now claims
to be B r i t a i n ' s biggest tour operator for the under 35 age
group. A s w e l l as the S p e c i a l Stopovers already mentioned
the new C o n t i k i concept for 1979 features camping tour
accommodation i n permanent " c a n v a s v i l l a g e s " - framed tents
set up in more than 12 major E u r o p e a n c i t i e s , such as
P a r i s , V i e n n a , B a r c e l o n a , V e n i c e , M u n i c h , Rome, Copenhagen,
O s l o , Stockholm a n d B e r l i n .
On some nights there are even bungalows and c a b i n s . In
Corfu there ate straw huts. C o n t i k i campers have one unusual
stopover in Holland: it i s at the Groot H u i s at Noordgouwe, about
50 kilometres south of Rotterdam in the Dutch countryside.
The Florentine v i l l a stopover residence, the Torre d l Gattaia
was once owned by the P i t t i family and has an olive grove and
swimming p o o l .
The 15th century Chateau D ' A g n a c , built for a k i n g of
Languedoc, is a short drive from the Mediterranean.
C o n t i k i coaches carry a courier, driver and " s u p e r c o o k " .
E a c h passenger contributes to a food kitty which covers the
cost of three meals a day (except for o c c a s i o n a l eating out
to sample l o c a l d i s h e s ) .
A n example from the range of C o n t i k i tours from London
in 1979 i s a " C e n t r a l E u r o p e a n " - s i x weeks and 13 countries.
T h e price includes touring, c i t y sightseeing, e x c u r s i o n s , a
seat at a Spanish bullfight, a canal cruise in V e n i c e , a v i s i t
to the salt mines at Berchtesgaden, a boat cruise on the R h i n e ,
tour of Amsterdam c a n a l s , and four days on the Greek i s l a n d
of Corfu, with water s k i i n g included too!
The C o n t i k i 1979 brochure a l s o has details of hotel tours
i n Europe, overland journeys between Kathmandu and L o n d o n ,
s k i tours i n A u s t r i a and hotel accommodation in London as w e l l
as a range of other f a c i l i t i e s at C o n t i k i ' s office in the West E n d .
Incidentally, 2 out of 5 C o n t i k i passengers are travelling
alone but obviously in a group of young people you soon make '
friends.
So if you fancy a taste of l i v i n g l i k e a lord, F r e n c h , Italian
or Gernian style, go C o n t i k i in '79 - i t ' s ah altogether different
experience!
