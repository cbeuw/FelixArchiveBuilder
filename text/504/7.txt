New Year
Mutterings
I hope you all had a very happy holiday and are now looking
forward to studying hard this term.
I'd like to congratulate the Rector on obtaining a Life Peerage
which was announced in the New Year's Honours List. I would
also like to congratulate all those others from Imperial mentioned
in the New Year'S Honours List whose names are too numerous
for me to remember.
In my last article at the end of last term I mentioned that
Shirley Williams would be making a major announcement on the
subject of overseas students at the World University Service
Conference held in late December. The announcement made was
not particularly mind shattering. She continued the line that
" t h e full economic c o s t " of overseas students was in the region
of £2.000 each and thai therefore there was a hidden subsidy
given'by the Government in the region of £100 million to overseas
students. She felt that this amount could be better used s u b s i d i -
sing those overseas students, in particular economic need, e.g.
from underdeveloped countries. The implication, however, was that
for the average overseas student, the future long-term review may
w e l l mean that they w i l l end up paying " t h e full economic c o s t "
in fees.
There is some consolation, however, that next year there w i l l
only be inflation increases in tuition fee levels. A s the policy
of Imperial C o l l e g e Union is to oppose any increases in fee levels
we w i l l , of course, be arguing against Governing Body accepting
any increase in tuition fees at their meeting at the end of this
term, it w i l l a l s o be an opportune time to again oppose the
discriminatory fee levels charged to overseas students.
Refectories
The Governing Body meeting held on the last day of last
term decided against the Refectory Committee's recommendation
of a 2% round the board increase on refectory prices. T h i s was of
course after considerable opposition from Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n .
T h i s seems to make unnecessary our boycott of the refectories
which was to take place early in the Spring term. It w i l l be up to
the Union meeting held on the 23rd January as to whether they wish
to continue with the boycott or not. There remains the problem of the
increase in refectory prices which came about at the beginning of
December of 1.9% due to the F i n a n c i a l Times index increase by
that amount. T h i s increase comes about as a result of the " r e g u l a t -
o r " which aims to make sure price increases on food stuffs are
kept up-to-date within the refectories. However, the student
representatives on the Refectory Committee realised that as the
cost of food only accounts for half the total cost of refectory meals
the increase should in fact have been only 0.95% in order to account
for food price increases. We w i l l therefore be raising this discrep-
ancy in the future as well as continuing the campaign to ensure that
the quality of the food is improved.
Ordinary Residence
There is a light on the horizon for those students who have been
refused grants due to the new definition of "ordinary r e s i d e n c e "
used by the authorities. Michael Arthur, the Union Welfare A d v i s e r ,
has prepared a legal paper on the definition which has now had the
support of C o u n s e l ' s o p i n i o n . The Union w i l l now be looking towards
encouraging i n d i v i d u a l s to take some local education authorities
to court over their refusal to give grants. If this action is unsucce-
ssful, however, the College is likely to take a sympathetic view of
the problems of these students who are suddenly faced with the
necessity to pay their own fees as well as find their own mainten-
ance for three years. It seems likely that the College w i l l set up
a Hardship fund to deal with this very s p e c i a l c a s e .
U.G.M.
Next U G M w i l l be on Tuesday, 23rd January, at 1.00 in the Great
H a l l , where amongst other exciting items on the agenda, w i l l be
the election of a Chairperson for Union meetings.
New Year Resolutions
My major New Year resolutions are firstly, to finish writing
FELIX articles in excess of three-quarters of an hour before
the copy deadline, and not to drink excessively more than
twice a week. I don't hold out much chance of s u c c e s s in
either case!

RECLAIM THE NIGHT!
A t the N U S N a t i o n a l Conference (Dec 78), a motion was
overwhelmingly p a s s e d , entitled " S e x u a l V i o l e n c e , R a p e , and
Reclaim the N i g h t " , and this c a l l e d for a national " R e c l a i m
the N i g h t " demonstration in L o n d o n , w h i c h is due to be held
next Saturday, 20th January, at 6.30pm in L e i c e s t e r Square.
The aim of a R e c l a i m the Night demonstration is to show
that women can walk alone at night without the protection of
men, and thus such a demonstration is for women o n l y . A s the
whole point of the demonstration i s centred around a woman's
right to walk alone, men being present would negate its reasons
and effect.
It i s part of the NUS campaign for Women's Safety, and I would
urge a l l women from IC to attend.
At U n i v e r s i t i e s , polytechnics and colleges throughout the
country, a mass movement has grown up to eliminate sexism from
entertainments, as part of an overall awareness that sexism tends
to prevent women from p l a y i n g a full and equal role in society.
It i s , of course, quite natural that such a movement should
originate and q u i c k l y spread among such educational establishments,
whose occupants are perhaps best able to recognise sexism for the
great s o c i a l e v i l that it i s . It i s gratifying that young intelligent
people are w i l l i n g to think beyond traditions and h a b i t s , and try
to change society for the better.
However, regrettfully, there i s s t i l l one bastion of male morons
who regard tradition as sacred, and s t i l l stubbornly refuse to open
their eyes to the harsh reality of life as it really is - because
they're not the ones who suffer. Perhaps one day, IC Union w i l l
reach out for its much needed s o c i a l conscience. Meanwhile, as
External Affairs Officer, it is very difficult to explain to
colleagues elsewhere exactly why Imperial C o l l e g e has just
about the most disgustingly s e x i s t Students Union in the
country - and is proud of i t .
