LETTERS
Dear Sir, - With further reference
to the open letter addressed to me
in F E L I X (8th November) about a
Scholarship for the disposal of
plastic coffee cups and my reply
in F E L I X (24th November) putting
the emphasis on s t y l e , I would
inform you that I d i d receive,
during my last lecture of last
term, an entry for the award
submitted by Mathematics stud-
ents, v i z . a medium size snowman
made from plastic cups and s e l l o -
tape. Whilst I accept this as a
most s t y l i s h seasonal method of
disposal of plastic cups, I regret
that the Committee cannot recom-
mend the award of the Aldous
Huxley Memorial Scholarship
s i n c e , to constitute a valid entry
this s e s s i o n , the integer number
(greater than one) of cups used
must be B O T H
(1) a perfect number, i.e. a
number equal to the sum o f its
d i v i s o r s , including one, but
excluding the number itself. F o r
example the first two perfect
numbers are 6 and 28.
A N D
(2) an odd number, i.e. not
d i v i s i b l e by 2.
Such v a l i d entries w i l l receive the
consideration of the Committee,
but all other plastic cups and
waste s h o u l d , of course, be
placed as usual in the recepta-
c l e s provided for this purpose.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. F . H . Berkshire
Senior Tutor, Mathematics.
Dear Sir, - In my original letter
there w a s , of course, no inten-
tion of implying that Prof.Garton
or Sir Hugh F o r d were present
members of A S T M S . Instead the
intention was to offer proof that a
student section of the C o l l e g e
Branch of A . S c W . / A . S . T . M . S .
had existed over a long period.
Briefly; from i t s formation i n
1918 until the 19 3 0 ' s the
A.S!c.W. membership w a s
e x c l u s i v e l y graduates or
equivalent. Then in the late
1930's student membership
became p o s s i b l e , whilst only in
the 1940's did technical staff
become entitled to j o i n . L a t e r
developments from 1968, with
the formation of A . S . T . M . S . ,
have made possible other
sections of membership.
The a c t i v i t i e s of the
Student Section of I.C. Branch
of A . S c . W . / A . S . T . M . S . have
mainly been traditional and
often clearly separate from the
mainstream a c t i v i t i e s of the
other groups forming the B r a n c h .
(One notable exception of this
was the mass joining by Chemistiy
Undergraduates i n the 1960's
when they elected their repre-
sentatives with the intention
of negotiating with their H e a d
of Department on various student
T h e H u m D r a m
we can beat It
W e got where we are by thinking differently.
By being individuals. B y employing people who can
bend their minds away from the straight and narrow.
The unusual problem is just grist to our mill.
The unusual answer is a natural phenomenon.
The usual genius is what we'd like.
The unusually intelligent is what we'll settle for!

matters !)
My impression i s that the
a c t i v i t i e s of the student section
in the late 1930's were w e l l
received; since , for example, a
suggestion that the then Rector
be approached to j o i n seems to
have resulted i n Sir Henry Tizard
being l i s t e d in 1938 a s a member
of the B r a n c h . A l s o claimed as
members at that time are 3 College
Professors and no less than 4
research a s s i s t a n t s in 'Heat
T r a n s m i s s i o n , C i t y & G u i l d s ' ,
including a 'Hugh Ford' with a
private address. Naturally i f
that i s in error it w i l l be noted.
Regarding Prof. Garton, the
Minutes of a General Meeting
held a t 5.15 p.m. on May 29th.,
1936, in the Small P h y s i c s
Theatre, l i s t a 'W.R.S Garton' as
being elected 'Secretary' of
the Student Section.
May I explain why at this
point in time the archival mater-
ial in my p o s s e s s i o n i s being
examined. It i s simply because
1978 i s the 60th year of the
College Branch and we are
hoping to celebrate this fact in
the new year. I hope to contact
any individual who was a member
at any time before 1948 with the
p o s s i b i l i t y of inviting some of
them to come a s guests. Further
since there i s a proposition to
write a definitive history of
the College Branch then rele-
vant information about the
early parts of i t s history i s
being saught now before
memories fade.
F i n a l l y it is hoped to do
something to restart a student
section o f the C o l l e g e B r a n c h
in the Spring Term with a
number of open meetings
and some other activity.
