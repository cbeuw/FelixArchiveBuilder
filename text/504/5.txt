LPS AND THE RENT ACT
London Property Services of Hamlet Gardens fame, have long
been notorious for their blatant evasion of the Rent Acts by
giving their tenants a so-called licence which purports to deprive
them of their status as protected tenants.
It operates on the b a s i s of a non-exclusive p o s s e s s i o n c l a u s e .
E x c l u s i v e p o s s e s s i o n means that the tenants have a right to
enjoy the accommodation that they occupy to the e x c l u s i o n
of everybody else (including control over a c c e s s by the
landlord and h i s agents). If a group of people take on a place
between them, a l l signing the same agreement at the same time,
then they are u s u a l l y joint tenants who, although they don't
have e x c l u s i v e p o s s e s s i o n as against each other, do have e x c l u s i v e
possession as a group.
The L . P . S . agreement tries to get round this by giving
separate agreements to each tenant and reserving the right for
the landlord to replace any occupier with someone else as and when
he chooses. T h i s breaks up the Joint tenant unit (if i t is accepted
as being valid) and so appears to get round the Rent A c t s .
Two recent Court of A p p e a l decisions upheld agreements of this
sort as achieving their expressed intentions and it had begun
to look as though this was going to become an established
loophole.
The most recent case, however, this time s p e c i f i c a l l y on
an L . P . S . agreement was decided by the Court of A p p e a l in
favour of the tenants, thus giving them full Rent A c t protection
and bringing them within the jurisdiction of the Rent Officer.
Theoretically, this means that a l l L . P . S . tenants (except those
in the college flats) can now apply to the Rent Officer for a
substantial rent reduction. The only snag, however, is that
the Court of A p p e a l case was decided not j u s t on the b a s i s of
the agreement but also on the attendant c i r c u m s t a n c e s . So
one can't say for sure that a l l L . P . S . tenants would be viewed
by the courts i n the same way. The report of the c a s e has not
yet found its way into print so it is difficult to t e l l whether or
not the circumstances i n that case were s u b s t a n t i a l l y different
from the usual L . P . S . set up. Nevertheless, because LJP.S.
follow a uniform letting procedure, it seems l i k e l y that other
L . P . S . tenants should be helped by this latest d e c i s i o n . If
nothing e l s e , it does indicate that the wind of change may be
blowing through the Court of Appeal which i s good news for
a l l l i c e n c e e s .
Because the position with regard to L . P . S . is not cut and
dried it is l i k e l y that you w i l l find Rent Officers reluctant
to register a fair rent as they don't like getting involved in
anything which i s at a l l contentious. Despite this, if any of
you L . P . S . tenants feel l i k e having a go at getting a fair rent,
perhaps you would like to come up to the Welfare Centre
(third floor U n i o n Building) for a chat about it.
