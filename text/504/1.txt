UNION TO GET TYPESETTER
£8000 Machine for Print Unit
A new phototypesetter i s to be purchased
for the Union print unit. The device, which
costs over £8000 including V A T , w i l l replace
the purely mechanical varityper used at
the moment.
The phototypesetter sets copy into c o l -
umns electronically and prints u s i n g an opti-
cal system onto photographic paper. It has
the advantages that i t is simple to use, it
produces justified text automatically and
the s i z e of type can be varied from 5Vi to 36
point from the keyboard.
Production of F E L I X w i l l be made easier
a s a result because the finished text w i l l be
available earlier, thus a l l o w i n g more time
for p a s t i n g - u p . In addition, the Handbook,
Alternative Prospectus and Phoenix w i l l
a l s o be set by the Union with a subsequent
improvement in their quality and f l e x i b i l i t y
of production.
The typesetter i s being p a i d for partly by
C o l l e g e , whose contribution is £4259, with
the remainder coming from the U n i o n over
several years. The Union down payment this
year is £2000.
