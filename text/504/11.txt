Refectory Boycott Off ?
The Refectory Boycott agreed last term
will not take place because the proposed
price rise was not implemented.
I C U n i o n E x e c u t i v e w i l l recommend that
the next Union Meeting c a l l off the 24 hour
boycott, w h i c h was to be organised early
this term, after I C Governing Body f a i l e d
to ratify the d e c i s i o n of Refectory Commit-
tee to r a i s e food p r i c e s by 2 per cent from
2nd January this year.
Governing B o d y , meeting on 15th
December, made its d e c i s i o n after a recom-
mendation by the Rector that no price rise
should be imposed at this stage. A total
sum of £50,000 from the C o l l e g e ' s Central
Equipment Fund was made available
to the Refectory Committee over the next
two years to finance the replacement of
major items of equipment.
Refectory prices are reviewed termly and
the next review w i l l be i n March. The use
of the regulator, l i n k i n g prices to inflation,
is to continue.
O/S Fee Increases on the W a y
Contrary to reports recently i n the p r e s s ,
the government has not shelved its
controversial p l a n s on overseas students.
This was made c l e a r by Shirley W i l l i a m s ,
Secretary of State for E d u c a t i o n and
Science, when she spoke to the annual
conference of the World U n i v e r s i t y Service
just before Christmas. She told delegates,
including those from Imperial, that at
present overseas students were being
s u b s i d i s e d on their tuition fees to the tune
of w e l l over £100 m i l l i o n a year, and that
this subsidy was quite indiscriminate and
applied equally to the poor and the r i c h .
She suggested that this £100 m should be
used " p o s i t i v e l y " to help " s e l e c t e d
g r o u p s " of overseas students, mainly
students from developing countries on
courses s a i d to benefit those countries.
T h i s would inevitably l e a d to large
increases i n fees for large numbers of
self-supporting overseas students not
e s p e c i a l l y " s e l e c t e d " , who would pro-
bably be charged the full " e c o n o m i c c o s t "
of their courses, w h i c h Mrs. Williams e s t i -
mated to be £2,450 for a university under-
graduate i n 1977, and £1,140 for a student
in non-advanced further education.
Mary Attenborough challenged several of
the points raised by Mrs. W i l l i a m s , and
explained that it was not r e a l i s t i c to
divide the total cost of an institution by
the number of students, and so arrive
at a cost per student, and therefore
disputed the " s u b s i d y " figure of £100m.
She claimed that education should be.
provided on need and academic merit,
not on a b i l i t y to pay, and argued for the
ending of discrimination in fee levels.
Maiy went on to attack Mrs. Williams
over the recent change i n the definition
of "ordinary r e s i d e n c e " as a q u a l i f i c a -
tion for receiving an L E A grant, which
she regarded as c a l l o u s . T h i s point was
echoed by F i o n a Mctaggart, N U S V i c e -
President (Education).
M r s . W i l l i a m s ' s speech and subsequent
replies to questions were greeted with
dismay and sceptism by an unsympathetic
audience of those dedicated to improving
the educational opportunities available
to those from third world countries.

Welcome to the 1979 face of ICX1 (approximately the same as
the 1978 face), and more e s p e c i a l l y to the 1979 version of
E l k ' s E p i s t l e i n w h i c h new heights of literary prose are reached
and new depths of humour plumbed - and topics as original and
innovatory as d u p l i c a t i n g , elections etc. etc. are written about
with devastating style and c l a r i t y . A n d first off the mark for
79 i s — . . .
Duplicating
Over the vacation I had, at incredible expense, the union gestet-
ner duplictors serviced and overhauled - that means the one up
h e r e i n the office and the two i n the F E L I X office. So the ones
in the F E L I X Office are now in peak condition so if you have to
use them for any reason (sexual or otherwise), - treat 'em right.
If you have forgotten or s t i l l need to leam how to use them then
if you l e t me know I w i l l put on another gestetner demo provided
there i s enough demand.
Dates
T h i s is a good opportunity to give a l l the important dates
for the term, these are:

Business Game
The game is an exercise in d e c i s i o n -
making in the simulated atmosphere of the
business world. Each team is given the
same basic information about conditions
and bases its d e c i s i o n s on advertising,
machine purchase, forecasting profits
etc. on this information thus determining
its development as a company.
The team members included undergrad-
uates , postgraduates and members of the
academic staff. Many of them began with
a flourish but their profits diminished as
the computerised results of their decisions
were analysed.
The day was, as usual, highly successful
and greatly enjoyed by the seventy
participants as they found themselves
increasingly involved in the economic
complexities of their s u c c e s s e s and
failures. In the final outcome the
winners were one of two teams from the
Mechanical Engineering Department of
Brunei University (their other team
came fourth). The Production E n g i n -
eering Department, also from Brunei, were
the runners up, and Professor Samuel
E i l o n , The Head of the Department of
Management Science, presented them
both with prizes as a prelude to the
festivities of the Christmas season.
B u s i n e s s Games have become an annual
event in the Department of Manage-
ment Science. On Tuesday 19 December,
•eleven teams from Brunei U n i v e r s i t y ,
Queen E l i z a b e t h , K i n g ' s and University
College and the London School of
Economics as well as three home teams-
from Imperial College competed for
the lead.

Typewriter
The Union Office is now the proud p o s s e s s o r of a reconditioned
typewriter for society use - the o l d one was rather knackered.
It was obtained from central stores a week ago and looks very
n i c e . (I really am f i l l i n g this article out now).
UGM Chairperson
If you were at the last U G M (like you should have been) then you
would know that from now on a chairperson of U G M ' s i s going to
be elected. The papers for t h i s are now up and w i l l be up until
next F r i d a y (19th), so if you are interested in c h a i r i n g U G M ' s and
know the standing orders backwards and also in 96 languages
then put your name up - it's a p o s t which doesn't take up a lot
of time but is very important.
Well that's a l l for this week folks, so remember - stay c o o l !
