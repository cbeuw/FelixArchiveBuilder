Off to A Good Start
O.K., so the very first issue of 1979 has an hideous mis-
take in the calendar. The papers for the Sabbatical and
D P . Elections go up on the 19th February not on the 29th
January as shown. Which leads me to
Election Fever
This is the term when IC becomes strewn with posters saying
"Vote For Me Because " and "Best Man for the J o b " etc.
Yes, election time will soon be on us with the buying of large
rounds in the bar, the inevitable hunt for seconders and all that
it entails. Remember manifestos are printed in F E L I X the week
before the Hustings U G M and posters can be printed here at
special rates for candidates. If you are thinking of standing
for one of the sabbaticals (President, Hon. Sec. & F E L I X
Editor) or for Deputy President then see the current holder
of the post to find out what the job entails. Further details
about publicity posters and manifestos will appear nearer
the election.
Paper Chain
The free gift/competition in the X'mas issue proved to be
a great success with seven entries ranging from thirty links
to over several thousand! The three largest chains were from
Life Sciences I, Maths and Physics who all bought lots more
links than I did!! (Cheating Rats). In the end Physics won
with a chain which stretched half way round Beit Quad. A l l
three were then joined to completely decorate the quad. And
then it rained.
Thanks to John Tidy for suggesting the idea (I spelt his
name correctly this time). Could someone from Physics let me
know when they want the barrel?
Field Cup
This annual event takes place on Tuesday 20th February
this year. Marshals are needed to help out on the day. Any
2nd or 3rd years interested should contact Dave Walls, care
of Guilds Union Office as soon as possible.
Bound Editions
Ex Libris finally finished the binding of last year's
F E L I C E S and they are now available to those who ordered one
from the F E L I X Office at Â£11 each, gasp!
A Happy New Year ........
to you all, and congratulations to the Rector on his life
peerage. Many thanks to Anita, our temporary varitypist, for
her first issue and to Ian for printing it. Have a good term,
John.

Reg Voltage looked across at his wife Zener and wondered
if there was any chance left for him to transformer. Their
shelf life was so full of high tension these days and neither
had the capacity any more to maintain a bistable state.
Suddenly there w a s a centre tap on the window and when
Reg looked out he saw a longtailed pair of eyes belonging
to Ivor G a u s s , h i s wife's ex-lover. In G a u s s ' hand w a s an
electron gun and a s R e g watched he inserted a cartridge, took
shure aim and pulled the trigger. T h e single shot reverberated
and R e g dropped rapidly to the deck, h i s life c u t dead short
at its most positive peak.
Ivor leaped in just as Zener grabbed the phono to d i l the
binary code and c a l l the fuzz. H e quickly took hold of her
and taped her loudspeaker to avoid any audio-breakthrough
and, having established a low noise state, he stopped to ponder.
He had to rectify the situation in some way and smooth things
over; he w a s afraid that the din would have upset the next-
door neighbour L . C . Bridge and lead to interference.
He listened - no noise, not even hums or rumbles - a l l was
w e l l . Walking to the nearby cabinet he removed a bottle,
filled the mixer and o s c i l l a t e d it vigorously as if h i s life
depended on i t . H e poured out the potential juice through a
filter, added a small current and watt he could in the timebase
a v a i l a b l e . Then he decided to v i s i t h i s transistor and brother
across the channel while allowing things to coulomb off and
so executed a quick thermal runaway.
Zener by this time had broken the tape and, although very
shocked, knew s h e had to contact her friend Meg Ohm and
tell her a l l that had happened. Ivor, she realised, was
terribly unstable and had to be caught and defluxed before
he caused any more gunn effects. She picked up the phono
and diled Meg; she heard the decibel ringing but it seemed a
decade before it w a s answered and she could discharge her
load to Meg, who immediately s a i d , 'I.C.' and being very
logical insisted on c a l l i n g the fuzz on the 625 line.
F e e l i n g a l l wirewound up Zener eased her tension by
having a smoke of pot but nanoseconds later the law arrived
at the voltage threshold to collector. Meg w a s with them
and they a l l shifted into the force v e h i c l e which w a s a fast
four pole motor; with the driver using full choke they sped away
down the bypass to try and short c i r c u i t the kilovolt Ivor.
While driving along Detector Schmitt asked Zener to verofy
a l l the facts and to be a s unbiased a s possible s o he could
relay the data to other units and switch the entire force output
on to the problem.
Reports q u i c k l y avalanched in a s to Ivor G a u s s ' position -
He had been detected near a gate into a field effect by the
A F C shore and it w a s not long before the motor reached
the spot and they could a l l see Ivor running away very fast.
Despite a loose bootstrap he ran on until he reached a
unijunction where he was momentarily quiescent before dashing
off down a low resistance path that led to the Darlington P a i r .
When he got to the end, he stopped and just stood, caught
in the modulated light beam of the motor's lamps. T h e atmos-
pherics were electrolytic and pulses quickened a s Detector
Schmitt ordered him to drop h i s electron gun and have the
sensitivity to respond to higher power levels, but instead G a u s s
just made bipolar digital s i g n a l s and gave a sawtoothy grin. H e
had obviously realised that push or pull he had no means of
escape, and as they watched him it was suddenly very
apparent that he was going to commit s i n u s o i d ; before anyone
could be galvanised into action he gave a half wave and emitting
an over modulated screech come howl jumped straight off
Darlington P a i r into the waves of the A . F . C .
T h e effect of a l l this high frequency drama on Zener was
that she broke down but Schmitt quickly took control and
assured her that the reaction w a s quite normal, and that a l l
had worked out for the best. T h i s brought her down to earth
before long and Schmitt asked if she and Meg would dyne with
him at the ' A u x i l i a r y In' the next day so they could engage
in some crosstalk about other things less harmful to the
memory systems. T h e reply was positive and that very day
a firm friendship w a s fused that was to produce a phase change
in a l l their lives by degrees, and Zener could see that despite
recent flux in events, she would solder on regardless.
The Very End
