Morning, Somewhere Near
.. .in through the door. Now he had
sover. The day had been long,
maybe too long. He was starting to
lose the edge and he knew it. The
incident in the common room had
been close, maybe too close. It was
only his quick reflexes, a little luck
and a clean shot with his pistol that
had saved him there. It was a stupid
move to check his internal post, a
mistake he would not make again.
At least now he knew who was after
him.
On reflection, the day had been
good. Three kills to his credit
already and it was only Monday.
The first two had been standard
pistol shots, but he had taken pride
in the third. An aerosol can with the
top taped down and 'Gas Grenade'
written on the side. He'd thrown it
through the open window while his
target inside had been doing
problem sheets. He remembered the
pleasure he'd had knocking on his
target's door and asking his target
to sign his death warrant.
It was late now. He needed a
good night's sleep so he could be
up early to wait for his next target
outside Chem Eng. He stopped
outside his room. Even this late in
the day he could not be too careful.
He readied his pump action shotgun
and slowly pushed the door.
Crouching down he peered round
the edge of the door. Even in the
dim light he could tell that the room
was clear. It was such a relief. He
hadn't really realised how on edge
he'd been until now. Now he was
safe.
On Friday 29th Jan we kick off Rag
Week in the best way possible -
R A G Carnival. Taking over the
Union in a manner similar to the
Freshers' Ball, the Carnival is going
to be massive this year. More than
just a party, this event is BIG, with
live bands, a disco and a Barfly.
And with all the proceeds going to
charity, it's just the job for getting
rid of any stray grant you have left!
He made a last check, put the
draft excluder against the door to
stop any attacks from there, and
walked slowly across the room to
the window. That was when the
ringing started. It took him a minute
or two to find the package. It was
just under his bed. It was a small
box with an alarm clock in and
'Time Bomb' written neatly across
the top. How it had got there he
could only guess. But the long and
short of it was that he was now
dead. Just as he realised this there
was a knock at his door...
Killer - there's nothing quite like
it. The idea is simple: on signing
up, you are given a target to
eliminate. Once eliminated, you
proceed to eliminate your target's
target, and so on. All the while,
however, you are trying to avoid
being killed by your own killer,
who may change when they are
killed by their killer. Confused?
Never mind, take part anyway. It's
great fun and there are C A S H
PRIZES for the most inventive kill,
and the Survivor. To find out more
come along to the Rag meeting on
Friday at 1.10pm in the Ents
lounge, or contact Andy Wensley
in the ICU office. The cost is only
£2.50 and two photos of yourself,
so take part!
A M E N D M E N T
To all those football fans out there
that signed up to collect at the QPR
v Man Utd match on Saturday 16th
January: the match has now been
changed to Monday 18th January.
Don't be disheartened - I am
reliably informed that this should be
an exciting match as Man Utd have
just gone to the top of the league.
Come to today's Rag meeting to
sign up if you haven't already done
so.
What does it feel like if the room
suddenly turns upside down and you
are left standing on the ceiling? Can
you lean on an elephant that isn't
really there but that you can see? Is
it possible to hypnotise someone to
do something they wouldn't
otherwise do? These and many
more questions answered at one of
the most fun and interesting events
of the year. Martin Taylor, a
professional hypnotist, gives a
short, humorous talk on hypnosis in
the first half of the show. Then,
after everyone has grabbed a quick
pint in the Union during the
interval, the second half is your
chance to get up on the stage and
find out just what he's been on
about. Those of you who have been
before will know to come again, but
for anyone who hasn't - buy your
tickets early, this show always sells
out! It's Thursday 4th Feb in the
Great Hall (cos it's the largest room
we can get), and tickets are only £3,
available from the Union Office.
Yes, the advent of Rag Week
heralds the approach of that
infamous event - the Sponsored
Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump.
All it involves is a tiny jump from
the back of a minibus outside
Harrods, and a quick sprint back to
College. What could be easier?
Well, okay, there is a slight snag -
you are only allowed to wear a
parachute harness and boots! This
event should appeal to all you
exhibitionists out there, so if you
haven't already picked up a sponsor
form you can do so TODAY at the
Rag meeting or from the Rag

SERVICES
You have probably read about such
things as Gnoming, Handcuff-a-
grams, and Grim-reaping in Felix
articles before Christmas (you
remember - that lovely holiday that
flashed past you at 150mph and left
you standing in your lecture theatre
looking dazed and at the start of a
whole new term!). Services are
basically a means for you to get
your own back on anyone who has
remotely annoyed you this year.
Get your roommate handcuffed to
someone they loathe, and they may
well retaliate by having you
followed around by an irritating
little gnome until you pay them
enough to go away. Guilds will also
be running their Hit Squad again,
so watch out for these experts of the
pie. If you'd like to liven up your
lecture in a different way, you could
even have a pint- a-gram delivered
to your lecturer!
Remember that Rag week comes
but once a year and is the best way
ever invented for making lectures
silly. We do rely heavily on you to
help us do this, though, so if you
don't mind missing a couple of
lectures then sign up and give us a
hand with a flan or two. To
volunteer your services as a gnome
or grim-reaper, sign up in the RCS
Office. For the Hit Squad, go to the
Guilds Office, where you can also
obtain immunity (at a price!) and
contact lens wearers can pick up a
badge to protect them from flans in
the face.
DIRTY
DISCO
I '93
Rag Conference '93
Monday 1st February in the
Union.Yet another opportunity to
get your kit off for charity, the
Mines Dirty Disco runs on slightly
different lines to a normal disco.
Basically, the less you wear the less
you pay - and yes, some people do
get in for free! However, if wearing
just a bowtie to a disco isn't your
kind of thing, then wear the whole
suit and just come along for the
entertainment - this is always a great
laugh!
While all you lazy bods where still
sleeping off your hangovers from
New Year, 14 slightly nutty people
pushed off to Manchester for a few
days of fun and frolicking with
other like-minded people. We were,
of course, not at a mass orgy but
not far off it at Rag Conference '93.
Consisting of seminars on how to
run and improve our Rag. The
Conference lasted three days, each
night ending with a social event (eg:
Hypnotist,Bungee running,
inflatable boxing and Gladiator
Dueling) and a disco. The seminars
(a very boring word for what was
great fun) were given by
experienced Raggies from all over
the U K and Eire. Our very own
Penguin gave two very sucessful
talks on Silly Ideas and How to get
Started. All of our Raggies now are
well clued up on how to make Rag
M O R E F U N , M A D D E R and
SILLIER FOR Y O U . As well as
that they all had a great time and left
keen to work and motivate. With all
our new found knowledge Rag
Week is going to be a stormer for
all involved and that includes you.
Last year Rag was discreet but this
year Rag will be
UNAVOIDABLE!!!!
Office. If you need an incentive to
strip then there is a prize for the last
nude person back to College.
Rachel Mountford (Rag Chair) has
promised to do the SNKPJ if she
gets over £300 in sponsorship! If
you don't have the figure or the guts
to do it yourself, please sponsor
anyone you know who does - and
that goes for any of the crazy events
people are doing during Rag Week,
from doing a stair climb up Canary
Wharf to dressing up as Noddy or
Big Ears.
