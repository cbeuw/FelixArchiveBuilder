Madness in Valencia
Lope de Vega, who wrote this play
around 1600, was a well known
womaniser in the high society of
Madrid. His writings were well
publicised by his behaviour and the
legal prosecutions against him. So
after being flagrantly indiscreet
about his desires for the wife of a
powerful Duke, he was exiled for
ten years in Valencia. Madly in
love, and mad with the Duke he was
inspired to write Madness in
Valencia.
The whole plot takes place in the
Hospital of the Innocents, the
world's first sanatorium. This place
was the first attempt to create a
centre where madness could be
treated as a curable illness.
The scandals and mad escapades
of the main hero Floriano and his
friend Leonato have obvious
resonances with de Vega's personal
life. The play is a fast-moving love
story which presents the adventures
of two lovers who take refuge in the
sanatorium. Passionate love and
insanity are compared along with
society's definition of madness and
what it accepts as sanity. Madness
from outside and inside the
sanatorium is displayed for our
laughter and pity.
Madness in Valencia, being the
last play in the series of six plays
for Europe, continues the excellent
tradition of the productions at the
Gate Theatre. The cast, as usual,
are exemplary.

Donizetti Variations,
Witchboy, Les Patineurs
The three ballets performed by the
London City Ballet at Sadler's
Wells were somewhat
disappointing. Donizetti Variations
was saved from mediocrity by a
graceful and exciting performance
from Eva Evdokuniova. Witchboy,
originally a ballad, tells of a
mountain community, dominated
by a fanatical preacher, who
believed in creatures who gave birth
to witches. Les Patineurs follows
the events of an ice skating party.
It is generally well performed and
certainly very colourful.

The Lion, The Witch and
the Wardrobe
Everyone should know this classic
story inside-out. Then why the first
half hour is presented in a muddled
fashion will baffle most people. The
reason for this is that the set, and
I use the term set very loosely, takes
too long to change.
The changing of scenes however
doesn't spoil your enjoyment of the
Panto. But be warned! There are
none of the 'Behind yous' and sing-
a-longs that are in your usual Panto.
This is more like a show than a
Panto. But why is it advertised as
a Panto?
Excellent performances can be
seen from the characters of Asian
(The Lion), The White Witch, Lucy
(youngest member of the family),
Edmund (spiteful bastard of the
family) and Maugrim (a
disgustingly evil wolf). But these
are shadowed by the disappointing
sound effects and the dingy set
which needs more than a little
re-think.

The Nutcracker
Guaranteed a full, uncritical house
for the whole Christmas run the
English National Ballet take the
opportunity to present the shoddiest
Nutcracker I have ever seen. I
doubt, if any of the taffeta-ed six
year olds in the audience will want
to return to this ballet every
Christmas since, as I have done.
Ben Stevenson's new choreography
is ugly, banal and boring.
Pepita/Ivanov's was not.
Tchaikovsky was a talented and
knowledgeable composer for the
theatre, Stevenson is not. From
whence has come this licence to
hack the score to pieces and cobble
it back together—cursing soloists
with marathons or sprints?
Maybe I would've been more
receptive to the changes had they
been well executed but, even in the
simplest steps the corps de ballet
were messy, half-hearted and
hampered by Desmond Heeley's
sets. Monstrous carcasses and
masks crippled the battle of Rats
and Soldiers into a hobbling frenzy,
blizzards beset the Land of the
Snow and the Land of the Sweets
became the Republic of Vulgaria.
Thankfully soloists Thomas Edur,
Renata Calderini and Agnes Cales
provided some beautiful, sensitive
dancing amidst the mayhem.

The Lion the Witch and the Nail
Extensions...
Mr Cinders
The Kings Head continues to dazzle
with forgotten gems polished to
wonderful productions. The latest
treasure is the 1929 musical-
comedy-role-reversing-Cinderella-
story Mr Cinders. Sam West,
bewitching as the put-upon 'poor
relation' Jim (Mr Cinders) heads a
sterling cast on a delightful skip
through some vintage 20s cliches.
The tiny stage is alive with
ingenious sets and ingenuous
choreography which together with
the sheer nerve and ebullience of the
cast detract from some quite feeble
singing. Vivian Ellis's music and
Greanex Newman's words have an
enchanting ease and sparkle from
the childlike 'Spread a Little
Happiness' to the Flanders-and-
Swanesque 'On the Amazon'. This
show deserves a West End transfer
but see it at the Kings Head where
it is an honour to be in and audience
almost as small as a cast who sing,
dance and act their hearts out.
