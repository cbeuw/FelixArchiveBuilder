Imperial Alzheimers
Breakthrough
by Declan Curry
An Imperial researcher has
predicted that a cure for Alzheimers
disease may soon be discovered. Dr
Gareth Roberts, Senior Lecturer in
Anatomy and Cell Biology at St
Mary's Hospital Medical School,
was commenting on this week's
research breakthrough which shows
the why and where of the disease.
Alzheimers disease currently
affects almost 350,000 people in the
United Kingdom. The disease has
been known to develop in a person
in their early fifties, and those
above eighty are at a higher risk of
developing the dementia. Dr
Roberts' research links the onset on
the degenerative brain disease with
head injury and old age.
This week's research focuses on
the presence in the brain of a small
molecule known as beta amyloid
precursor protein. This protein
normally helps repair and maintain
nerve connections in the cortex
region of the brain. According to Dr
Roberts, Alzheimers disease may
be caused by the presence of too
much of this protein in the brain.
Beta amyloid precursor protein is
produced if the head suffers a
serious injury, or if the head is
repeatedly damaged. Such injury or
damage is known as head trauma,
an everyday event which results in
over 100,000 hospital admissions in
the United Kingdom every year.
Long term survivors of head
trauma, such as boxers, have high
levels of beta amyloid precursor
protein in the brain, and many of
these develop forms of dementia in
later life. Dr Roberts' team at St.
Mary's have been investigating a
possible link between Alzheimers
disease and head trauma by
studying observations from 16 head
injury cases.
Speaking on IC Radio, Dr
Roberts said that brain neurons
which are first affected by
Alzheimers disease tend to contain
more beta amyloid precursor
protein than other neurons in
different parts of the cortex.
Additional amounts of the protein
are produced around the age of
fifty, when the neurons undergo
'resprouting'. Dr Roberts claimed
that the combination of the
additional protein with the existing
protein 'triggers the disease
process', and described the
resprouting period as 'the critical
time for developing the disease'.
Dr Roberts said that the research
had 'pulled together a lot of threads
and really focused our attention on
controlling the protein'. When
asked about a possible cure, he said
that 'people are actively identifying
compounds even as we speak, and
great strides forwards would be
expected any day now'.
The research has been welcomed
by Alzheimers sufferers support
groups. Clive Evers, of the
Alzheimers Disease Society, said
the work was 'significant' in
developing the understanding of the
link between Alzheimers disease
and the aging process. "The one risk
factor we do know about in relation
to Alzheimers disease is the aging
process,' he said.

Chris Davidson,Imperial College
Union President, invited members
of the University of London
General Union Council (GUC) to
join with the Imperial College
Union in a breakaway council with
himself as chairman. M r Davidson
was reported by several senior
sabbaticals of other Unversity of
London Colleges to have been
drunk when he made the statement.
Mr Davidson was reported to be
extremely critical of the level of
debate in the GUC, saying that it
was 'inaccessible' to its members,
and so did not serve its purpose. He
allegedly claimed that the new GUC
would not suffer from the same
problems and would resolve the
difficulties that the current
organisation suffers from.
In an interview with Felix, M r
Davidson said that he 'definitely
wasn't drunk,' and that he 'made
some valid points' at the meeting.
At the last Imperial College Union
Council meeting - when questioned
about his comments by a Felix
reporter - he is reported as saying
that he spoke against a U L U motion
on the break-up of the University
of London because he considered
the motion premature. Mr Davidson
said that no firm proposal for
defederalisation was on the table.
He has made no comment on the
breakaway Council since.
