Felix 953 1 5 January 1993
T o p l a y a t m a d n e s s
Felix is overawed by Brannagh 's Hamlet at the Barbican
Eight years after leaving in Henry
V's blaze of glory Kenneth
Brannagh returned to the RSC in
December in his third stab at the
role of the most famous Prince of
Denmark. Despite the long absence
from the RSC's stage enforced by
the making/directing/starring in
films such as A Month in the
Country, Henry V, Dead Again and
Peter's Friends (soon to be voted
the most 'luvy' film of '92), young
Ken still seems to know how to use
a stage.
Designer, Bob Crowley was
pretty adept too, setting the action
forward a few hundred years to the
beginning of this century in an
Edwardian reign although sending
Hamlet off to England via Elsinore
Station somehow failed to convince
(it was, at least another excuse for
some obligatory dry ice). The
breathtaking 'play within a play' set
in Act III with a sumptuous
vermilion auditorium sweeping
skywards was, on the other hand
spectacular, although, as it was used
for the whole act, this also had to
double as Gertrude's bedroom.
The plot was not Shakespeare's
own and although the outlines of it
can be traced back to one of the
Greek tragedies, there is a story in
Danish legend of Amleth way back
in the 12th century.
TS Eliot took a rather dim view
of the scenario in infamous
criticism:
We must simply admit that here
Shakespeare tackled a problem
which was too much for him. Why
he attempted it at all is an insoluble
problem; under compulsion of what
experience he attempted to express
the inexpressibly horrible, we
cannot ever know.'
But then, what would you expect
from a man whose name is an
anagram of 'TOILETS'.
Direction from Adrian Noble
(who was responsible for the RSC
Henry V) paced the play mostly at
an astounding rate in order to fit the
unabridged version of one of
Shakepeare's longest plays into just
under 4V4 hours—any longer and
concentration would have begun to
seriously wander.
Only the power of the cast kept
the attention and after the strength
of the support in Kenneth
Brannagh's own production of
Hamlet on Radio 3 this summer
including Judi Dench, John
Geilgud, Emma Thompson (of
course...) could have led to
disappointment. John Shrapnel's
mean uncle Claudius exuded evil to
almost pantomime proportions but,
mirroring this with moments of
horrifying calm, kept the character
within the bounds of possibility.
Joanne Pearce's Ophelia swung
between the polarities of an
innocent sister, confused lover and,
after her father's death, lunatic (she
played a pretty good corpse too)
with rare ease, completely
convincing in her bereaved
madness. Polonius (David Bradely)
bristled bureaucracy from every
pore, allowing the comedy of his
verbosity to come searing through
the text and Laertes (Richard
Bonneville) acted out his part as a
pawn in Claudius' hands, ignorant
of his monarch's sins. Rob Edwards
as Horatio was not, as often is the
case over-shadowed by the
character of his friend, so his final
speeches, after Hamlet's death were
not at all an anticlimax. Clifford
Rose's Ghost of Hamlet's father,
however, was frankly a
disappointment. Striding around in
the opening scenes, he looked like
a kind of Darth Vader in negative
and obviously belonged to the
school of thought which holds that
a sense of the seriousness of the
'aagoneeey' of his 'faaaaate' is best
imparted by speaking with a silly
voice. He soared and swooped at
the words until they seemed to duck
and run for cover.
