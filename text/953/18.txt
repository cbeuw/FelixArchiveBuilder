IC thrashes St Marys Rugby seconds
IC Men's 1st XI v St Mary's
4 - 1
The men's hockey teams bounced
into the new year, on Wednesday
lunchtime to the sight of three teams
each consisting of less than 9
players apiece. However, judicial
cancelling by the 2nds allowed the
lsts to take 13 players to Willesden
Stadium and the challenge of our
medical half-brothers.
It is said that if you dig a grave
in the rain, it feels like your own.
A similar experience can be visiting
Willesden Stadium, 2 hours before
pushback in the driving rain with
violently swaying floodlights and
the cracking concrete of sixties
architecture.
Funnily enough, the first fifteen
minutes of the game showed
something of the cracking formation
of a team out of fitness and position.
St Mary's had the consistent
pressure and were only let down by
spasmodic shooting (and Simon the
goalie of course). However we
managed to claw back some shape
into our play with help from the left
side of midfield. Finally we were
lucky enough to convert a
somewhat innocuous chance from
the golden stick of Dave Fairhurst
(the star of stage and screen). Thus,
heartened we held on until half-time
and a welcome rest for our legs.
Starting the second half, we
buoyed in action and quickly scored
again, thanks to the phantom
wobble of Captain Goatie. From
that point, the game was over as a
spectacle. We scored twice again as
St Mary's suffered a cardio-
vascular demise at the heart of
defence—Samin and Dave (again)
adding the vital touches.
As the game dragged into the
closing stages. St Mary's
resuscitated enough to finally stick
a chance away and score. Quite
what happened in the defence, who
knows, it probably had something
to do with Simon's aversion to clean
sheets (only 1 in 16 games). Still it
keeps him humble.
Many thanks to the flying
Dutchman, Martin, for staying
afloat long enough to umpire for us,
and the second team player who
relieved our distress.
Public announcement: St Mary's
have in no way been slagged off.
Team: S Curwood, M Helayel,
I Haines, D Parkinson, J Cooper,
J Jordan, D Brooks, S Ishtiaq, M
Farshaw. D Parkinson.
IC Second IV 7
Charing Cross 29
A disapointing game considering
we were looking for retribution
since the last time we met Charing
X. We started with the wind on our
side and still they put one over the
line. We came back with a storming
try from no.8 Simon Fuller shortly
after Melvin Aguh had keenly run
through to the dead ball line. The
try was converted by the Wind and
Adam Wood, who had a harder job
kicking in the second half when we
were facing the wind. The pack
made a good effort against a
stronger opposition, with the return
of the regular pairing of Matt
Toolin and Simon Wilkinson to the
second row. Andrew Pennington
and Boris Phsbouski also had an
excellent game, giving credit to
their usual team, RSM.
IC Rugby meet Sundays at 12,
Mondays at 6 and Tuesdays at 12

Rugby firsts
IC 1st X V v Charing X
Charing Cross ended IC's winning
streak (of one) at Harlington on
Wednesday with an outstanding
display of 'getting the ball and
booting it as far as they could down
our end'.
IC had the benefit of Hurricane
'Bastard' behind them in the first
half, but the combination of Rich
Clemmy pulling a ligament and
Leon Orr making his presence felt
by kneeing Richard Stubbs' head
into Hillingdon Hospital restricted
IC to two Stuart Paynter penalties
for a 6-0 halftime lead.
The conditions weren't kind to
the home team as Hurricane
'Bastard' turned into Hurricane
'really quite breezy' and the visitors
peppered IC's goal line with high
balls.
After twenty minutes of
consistent pressure Charing Cross
scored in the corner followed soon
after by a penalty for a 'not very
blatant' offside, Charing Cross
rounded off the scoring with a
pushover try and the referee took
pity and blew up ten minutes early
with the final score IC 6 Charing
Cross 13.
