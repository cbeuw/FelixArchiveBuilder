Music
1 5 January 1993 Felix 953
Lise Yates and MacCarter huddle around a raging
fire and tell their grandchildren of the strange
happenings during the winter of '92
Let me explain. We've done it
before, we'll do it again. Come hell
or high water, at Christmas,
McCarter (who will write in italics),
and I, Lise Yates, celebrate by
exposing ourselves to as much
music as our banks will take. So
where did we start this year?
The Camden Palace, favourite
haunt of Tuesday's indie kid, and
half to population of Osaka. On
stage, the band who should've been,
That Petrol Emotion.
Unceremoniously dropped by
Satan's alliance with EMI, they're
now the band with no label. Finely
crafted songs drifted from the stage
and I stood, captivated.
Sweet Jesus have been compared
to Suede by the music press.
Musically they are not the same.
Neither do they look the same. They
are not the same, and what's more
comparing these two is rather like
comparing John Major to Saddam
Hussein and claiming that both are
enigmatic world leaders. Got it?
Whereas dear old Brettfrom Suede
looks comfortable with his
apparently ambiguous sexuality, Mr
S.J. has the aura of an adolescent
dressed in his mother's underwear
frightened to really let go in case
she should return unexpectedlyfrom
shopping at Tesco. The same sad
figure on stage looks like a man who
really has no confidence in what
he's doing. Quite appropriately
though, the rest of the band behind
him seem equally unimpressed. In
short Sweet Jesus have an
appearance on "The Word'. An
Austrian friend of mine hits the nail
on the head, "They're very boring
aren't they?' he offered. I had no
inclination to disagree. Whatever
your religion, pass this lot by on the
other side.
Friday night. Two weeks after the
Factory shut down for good, the
first of their ex-bands to re-emerge
assemble on the stage. Some of
them apparently oblivious to their
new found label-free status. Jez (to
rhyme with Bez) of the Adventure
Babies, for it is they, is resplendent
in a Factory t-shirt. The Adventure
Babies' greatest achievement, for
those of you unaccustomed to their
work, is to have their album cover
copied by Madness, (cf: 'Laugh',
Zark was slightly puzzled by his rather prominent position on the music
'Madstock'). Opening with
'Wheelaway', seems to be another
'Fac You', the lines 'giving up my
house...', and sprinkling a few new
songs through the set; they're not
finished yet.
Returning to College, I'm faced
with a dilemma. Geno Washington
or Herb. Some dilemma. Dexy's
hero didn't stand a chance. Herb's
support, were better than I
expected; a lot better than I
expected. Still, I had only expected
to have this unresistable urge to
transport myself to the bar. They
stopped me in my tracks, tried to
kill me with thirst. Very Ride, very
good.
But not as good as Herb. Herb for
those of you who have remained
ignorant of their charms through
misfortune or dogged perversity,-
are the bright light in all Essex,
eclipsing even Charley The Cat's
Prodigy and, the curiously silent of
late, Blur. Herb are closer to the
latter, with a curiously good
songwriting ability, one which is
ably demonstrated in such songs as
'Beatsugar' and the absent without
leave 'Never Say Dinosaur'.
If the phrase 'Oz's finest' could
ever be considered a compliment,
then it must go to Bjorn Again.
Ignore, if you will, their Christmas
attempt, as it shows very little of
what they're about. They are about
Abba, and at the Town & Country
Club they are resplendent, complete
with numerous costume changes, a
massive set, and giant letters from
Erasure's 1989 tour for their
versions of ' A Little Respect' and
'Stop'. 'So what if at least half the
audience were in false beards, in
case of recognition by a casual
acquaintance in Kentish Town? I
was there, and I'm not afraid to
explain why: It's fun, a whole lot
more fun than certain nineties
miserablist bands I could name.
A lot more fun, too, than the
world's worst hypnotist. Thousand
Yard Stare put him on stage,
presumably to implant subliminal
messages like 'you will buy our
album' in the minds of the faithful.
On the other hand, it maybe just to
prevent their fans from suffering
more than twenty minutes of Brian,
their main support band. Brian are
in fact more successful at inducing
sleepiness than any hypnotist. Were
TYS worth the wait? Probably, if
only to hear '0-0 aet' and 'Come
Uppance' played very loudly.

Besides, any band that gives out
free sweets and party things can't
be all bad.
Speaking of bad, and I realise
probably ranks as one of the worst
connections of the decade,
supporting The Farm at the
rescheduled Astoria gig, were Big
Audio Dynamite...
Hatred is not a word one might
normally associate with a musical
opinion. No matter how I try though
I have to confess that I do indeed
hate Big Audio Dynamite for not
leaving the stage earlier. What's
more lam filled with loathing by the
way they then returned to do an
encore that absolutely nobody asked
for. This evening at the Astoria was
not about hatred though. Infact had
I let my hatred slip out and become
a shout of derision I would have
looked positively out of place. And
so, begrudgingly I try to calm
myselfas I'm toldfor the umpteenth
time that I really ought to have more
patience for BAD U. 'After all Mick
Jones used to be in a great band'.
Quite simply, Mick Jones is no
longer in a great band.
Despite being deprived of an
interview with the Farm at the last
moment I have infinitely more
