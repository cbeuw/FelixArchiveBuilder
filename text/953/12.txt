patience for the amiable scousers.
Even when the clock reaches eleven
thirty and they still haven't taken the
stage I am relatively calm. The last
time I saw the Farm they were
pelted offstage with cow dung at the
Reading Festival, since then they
were dumped off the Madstock bill
thanks to Morrissey and their last
London gig lasted just 55 seconds
on Friday the 13th. Earlier today
they had flown in from LA at 3am
and up until two hours before
tonight's gig I was reliably informed
that they were all asleep in their
hotel. Oh dear, not quite the setting
for a classic. As it turned out, it
wasn't exactly a classic, but then if
you want classic, go see Phil
Collins. The Farm somehow always
manage to create a bloody good
mood when they play, not the sort
of mood that makes you want to
explode with dance energy or get on
people's shoulders and punch the
air but a mood that somehow makes
you believe in the world again. It
sounds a bit heavy, I know, but I
still believe that if all the world's
leaders gathered in one place and
listened to 'All Together Now'
there'd be the biggest 'love-in' since
Mandy Smith invited Bill Wyman
round to help her with her
homework. I can't believe how good
the vibe was in this place after only
half an hour or so. When it started
to snow at the end I just wanted to
die right there and then. Honestly,
is there more to life?
James were on the Factory label
once. This, of course, is prehistory.
Besides, James have been on most
labels, but Factory will be missed
a great deal more than the doomed
T&C, where they played for us
tonight what was announced as an
'acoustic' performance. What it
actually was, wasn't much different
to their other shows, apart from the
lack of the trumpet player, who has
left for pastures new. What we hear
is 'Johnny Yen', 'Sound', and 'Sit
Down', during which the audience
thankfully remain on their feet.
What we don't hear includes 'Come
Home, 'Lose Control', 'How Was
it for You?'.
The whole essence of this gig
reminds me of Tori Amos' rendition
of Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen
Spirit'. Suddenly the rawness is
gone and a different kind of mood
takes over. Where was anger comes
mild rebuke, where was energy
comes a mild tingly sensation and
where once were cast away words
are now heart-felt paeans. The only
problem is you can't bloody well
dance to it can you ? The last thing
anybody in the T&C on thisfestive
evening wanted to do was hold
hands and sway gently...people
wanted to dance. Iam definitely not
The first and last time Metallica will ever appear in an issue of Felix
imagining this. At even the slightest
of up tempo moments in flute solos
the audience prepare to crowd surf
and stage dive only to be
disappointed when moments later
silence prevails again. If you ask me
this was a clever rip off. At eleven
quid a ticket and not even having
to break sweat the band will be well
pleased with the evening's earnings.
Prepare yourself for the Napalm
Death tour of selected poems and
canticles.
Saturday came around once
more, and Voice of the Beehive
round off a low key tour of assorted
dives around the country, ending up
in the dive of dives, the Marquee.
With appalling sound, and
occasional stage lighting to contend
with, the band do a fine job,
covering Zodiac Mind warp's 'Slut
Freak' and, after much shouting
from a determined section of the
audience 'Sit Down'...
The Frank & Walters are
brilliant. I've said it before and I'm
saying it now, but lest you don't
believe me, here's a second opinion
from someone new to their work...
The Family Cat can be bearable,
as shown at Glastonbury, it's just
at these shows, they, how you say,
weren't.
Since this third on the bill slot
with Carter, The Franks have gone
on to much greater things. Top of
the Pops to be precise and I predict
that in the next twelve months they
will have three number one singles
and a platinum selling album in 14
countries around the world. To say
the least they are the brightest,
boldest, poppiest new band to
emergefrom 1992 and anyone who
doesn't seize upon them before they
becomefashionable is missing out.
Bugger Suede, The Frank &
Walters have infinitely more right
to be crowned the Best New Band
in Britain. 'After All' is easily the
best thing in the top 40 and already
I'm in danger of being agreed with,
as it soared to number 11 in the
national chart yesterday. The
Franks have everything that a pop
band should; matching orange
boiler suits, matching wooly
jumpers and even matching
haircuts. They're between song
banter is as it should be, nothing
poignant, no world challenging
egos, just total and utter gibberish.
Wonderful stuff.
The Family Cat were bloody
awful. Itpains me to say so as only
six months ago I half-heartedly
predicted an up-turn in their
fortunes. As 1993 looms-in I whole-
heartedly retract that statement.
EVERYBODY else in here has
come to see Carter tonight. I'm even
willing to place a tenner on the fact
that Carter is EVERYONE'S
favourite band except mine. There
are exceptions to every rule though
and tonight all the exceptions were
up in the VIP bar watching and
listening through noise muffling
plastic windows. I too was more
than happy to not suffer the full
effect of Carter's performance. I
guess I've just seen it all once too
often, mildly memorable songs
shouted across at blank faces that
don't really care what the people on
the stage are saying. Yes, the lights
ARE bright and the decor WAS very
festive but thefact that Carter's last
album ended up in the top 10 of
most despicable things of 1992
(Melody Maker) is enough to
convince me that the hospitality
area has more to offer.
Carter have gone too far. They
are one stop away from Stadium
rock. This, of course, means
nothing to their legions of fans, who
still shout 'You fat bastard', a year
to the day since Jon Beast last
appeared on the stage with them;
fans who say 'the sound's good
tonight', when it was in fact
murkier than the air in L A ; fans
who reward every predictable
mention of 'Brixton' with the
cheapest cheer possible. They,
when asked would say 'they were
brilliant'. The truth is too far
removed from that to credit anyone
with that belief with any judgement
at all. Not that I dislike Carter. (Oh
no?) I like their songs, I like their
albums, I like their wordplay. I love
'Billy's Smart Circus'. BUT. I want
good sound, I want involvement, I
want to feel that the band are trying.
I don't want my most pervasive
memory of the night to be 'what is
the riff from the McEwan's advert
with the big ball, doing in the
middle of 'Sherrif Fatman'?'.
