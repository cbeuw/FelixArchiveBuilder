Future Phones call to Students
Tanya Nazim and Trish Dooling advertise thefront line ofphone technology
being brought from the USA to Princes Gardens
Imagine not having to fumble in
your pockets for coins or a
phonecard the next time you use a
telephone on campus. Imagine
being able to phone home or
anywhere else from College at
anytime without having to worry
about having the correct change. It
sounds good, doesn't it? Well,
thanks to modern technology, easier
and more convenient telephoning is
at your fingertips in Southside.
In the USA, roughly 80% of
colleges have an internal
telephoning system whereby, with
the use of a pin-number, any
telephone on campus can be used to
make a phone call. The call
automatically results in a bill made
out to the caller. Therefore there is
no hassle with money at times
where it may not be convenient.
This year, plans are being made
for such facilities to be extended to
the UK. And what makes it even
more exciting is that the first place
in the whole of the U K to receive
this is none other than the Southside
Halls in Prince's Gardens.
Residents of these halls who
subscribe to this system will be able
to dial a number, put in their
personal authorisation code and
make a phone-call.
The company introducing this
system is A C C Long Distance U K
Ltd a subsidiery of A C C Long
Distance Corporation. This is one
of the largest independent long-
distant carriers in the north eastern
United States. It is also one of the
largest carriers in Canada.
An experimental period begins
from January 1993. From this time
onwards, subscribers will be able to
use the facilities and, A C C hopes
also produce as many suggestions
as possible. As the company will
have a help desk in Southside and
offices in High Street Kensington,
students will be able to voice their
views easily. Originally expansion
had been planned for the first term
of next year. However, due to
overwhelming student demand, the
telephone service has been
expanded to any student residing in
Prince's Gardens who wishes to use
Soufhside extensions to place thier
calls. Additional campus extensions
9 H H H H H
have been installed in the lounges
for PAC calling convenience.
The student will receive a special
A C C card with identification and
part of P A C (Personal
Authorisation Code) on it. The
remaining portion of the PIN
number will be provided separately
to avoid the problems of stolen or
lost cards.
Should a card or pin-number be
lost, however, reports would have
to be made immediately to A C C
customer service. This could be
done at any time by calling
extension 6025.
The benefits of this system
include the fact that A C C charges
are 10% less than BT coin or card
phones. Some people may argue
that Mercury costs even less. Well,
the point is that in the local area
Mercury costs only 1 % less than
BT. Overseas calls can also be
made by using P A C . Another
important benefit, is that any
campus extension within Southside
can be used to place calls so, a
student is less likely to queue to
place a call, as is currently the
practice with BT payphones.
Bills will be sent every month to
the caller where each call is
itemised. Ideally, each subscriber
will have stated at the beginning of
the term roughly how much he or
she would spend in a month. If bills
exceed the expected limit before the
month is over, A C C will contact
them to let them keep track of how
much they are spending. However,
no deposit is required.
In addition to the standard 10%
discount, A C C is offering an
addtional cheque rebate of 10% the
total term billing, returned at the
end of the year if all phone bills are
paid on time. Students who pay on
time can save as much as 20%.
This entire project is sure to
prove extremely exciting for the
whole of the U K as well as
Southside. This is the beginning of
a whole new telephoning system.
Eventually subscribers will be able
to utilise the system outside
campus. Subscribers will also
receive, upon request, pin-numbers
for specific phone numbers, with
the help of these, they may call that
number from selected countries
abroad.
In most colleges in the USA,
there also exists an 'Affinity Card'.
This is a security 'swipe' card,
telephone card and credit card (for
shops on campus) all rolled into
one.
As the communication network,
behind the scenes, eventually
develops and expands more, such
benefits will be made available to
