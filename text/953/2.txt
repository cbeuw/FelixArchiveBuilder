The results of the 1992 Research
Assessment Exercise, carried out by
the now- deceased Universities
Funding Council (UFC), give
Imperial College a weighted
average score of 4.4 out of a
maximum of 5. Departments in
Science and Engineering clock up
an average of 4.9, on the 1-5 scale.
The scores for individual
departments or units have been
published by Sir Eric Ash, College
Rector. Biological Sciences,
Chemistry, Physics, and Applied
Mathematics all score a maximum
five, as do Computer Science,
General Engineering, Chemical
Engineering, Civil Engineering,
Electrical and Electronic
Engineering, Mechanical,
Aeronautical and Production
Engineering, Mineral and Mining
Engineering, and Metallurgy and
Materials.
Four points have been awarded to
Biochemistry, Earth Sciences, Pure
Mathematics, Statistics and
Operational Research, and
Environmental Studies. The lowest
College score for individual units,
that of three points, has been
awarded to Management and
Business Studies, Clinical
Laboratory Sciences, Community-

In other changes, the level of fees
received by the funding council for
science based courses has remained
constant. The Department for

Imperial College stands to benefit
from the move.
Mary's Hospital Medical School
were singled out for 'particular
excellence in research above the
overall rating'. This excellence was
demonstrated in General Practice,
Hepatology, and Infectious and
Tropical Diseases. The Department
of General Practice includes the
new Lisson Grove Social Security
Benefits Programme, developed by
Professor Brian Jarman, OBE, and
currently used at 800 sites by an
estimated 3,000 users. The General
Practice Department is also
currently running a 'comprehensive
and independent national survey' of
5,000 patients, with answers
helping hospital staff meet standards
set out in the Patient's Charter.
The U F C results follow the
publication last October of the
Times Good University Guide. The
Times ranked Imperial College
third nationally, after Cambridge
and Oxford respectively. Imperial's
overall score of 801 out of 1,000
included 70 out of 85 on library
spending, 33 out of 55 on college
accommodation, and 32 out of 80
on teaching. The Times survey
ranked Imperial first nationally for
research, sciences, and engineering,
while the College was not ranked
in the national top ten table for
medicine.
The U F C was reformed as the
Higher Education Funding Council
at the start of this academic year.
