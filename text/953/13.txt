Banquets for Bankrupts from
Get StuffedII
Anyone who has had bouts of
insomnia, a desire to watch the
repeat showing of the chart show or
even taken a pathological desire to
watch T V all night, has probably
seen 'Get Stuffed ' - a five minute
cooking programme presented in a
'wacky ' manner. The recipes
included have been brought together
in a book, together with some
frighteningly unfunny cartoons,
rhymes such as "fill your pockets
with potato croquettes" the literary
value of which I feel unable to
comment upon. More importantly,
it's packed with recipes which are
cheap and probably nutritious;
what's more, they're simple to
make, and mostly quick and easy.
You've seen the show, now you can
get the book and eat the stew.

Halo by Tom Maddox
Jumping on the 'Virtual Reality
Band-Wagon', this book is another
attempt to take the recently over-
worked subjects of VR and AI and
to use them for he centre point for
a futuristic world.
The content is a mix of interesting
scientific views of the future and a
rather dull, uninteresting story.
'New' ideas are cleverly put across;
a mind to computer 'transplant' is
the basis of the story, with an earth
type ecology on a ring world in
orbit being the background.
It seems to be a recent trend of
science fiction writers to fit their
stories around technology, rather
than fitting technology into the
stories whether or not there is a
basis in fact. To give Tom Maddox
his due the factual content has been
well researched and is interesting;
however, anyone looking for the
facts will have a hard time wading
through the dialogue.
This is not a easy book to read,
but for anyone wanting the direction
in which V R and AI is going, it is
well worth reading.

Sex
Pornography or art? I prefer to look
at this book as art, although its
contents may cause some people to
think otherwise. The book has its
own unique style which to some
extent defies classification: The foil
packaging, the metal cover, and the
shear size of the thing. This is not
a book that can be discretely hidden
in your pocket.
The media have given 'Sex'
enough hype to make people think
that it is nothing but pictures of
Madonna, naked, by herself, and
sometimes with other people doing
un-heard of things. For some parts
of the book this is completely true,
that is until you are confronted with
one the numerous pages of text.
These present themselves in three
main forms: The first of these is the
text on a blank page or with a
picture behind it. These pages re-
enforce the idea that pornography/
sex/reading dirty literature makes
you go blind since the font for these
pages is large and bold. The content
of these pages vary from deep and
meaningful observations about sex
and love, to Madonna's childhood
confusion about sex, to graphic
accounts of her waking up to the
feeling of her lover 'taking her from
behind'.
The second type of text appears
on a page covered by small and
often meaningless pictures, with the
scrawled writing positioned just
about anywhere. The content is
similar to the above, but takes
longer to read since at least half of
it is undecipherable without close
examination.
The third and possibly funniest
Cyberpunk by Katie Hafner &
John Markoff
I hate it when people blame
machines. After all who made the
machines? So when people use the
machines and do things with them
that others don't like are they
committing an offence? What if it's
something that its not supposed to
do?
Computer security and law are
vague areas at the best of times and
this book chronicles three examples
to illustrate it. The accounts range
from experiments that went wrong,
through to determined intrusion.
One common trait through the
stories is the 'weirdness' of the
perpetrators. This does nothing to
dispel the stereo-type of the lone
bespectacled figure hunched over a
gleaming hot machine. Also, its
narrative style presets the facts in
a rather inhuman manner, only
briefly dealing with the morality of
the people's actions.
The technical content of the book
type is in the form a letter, written
by Dita (Madonna pretending to be
a mistress), to a character known as
Johnny. In the letters, she basically
pleads him to see her as much as
possible, since she misses his dick.
The letters contain a few ways in
which Dita and Ingrid (the ugly,
short-haired bitch from Justify My
Love and the Erotica video), relieve
their sexual boredom.
The pictures are what Madonna
describes as her fantasies and these
include; group sex, whips, leather,
wearing no clothes in public places,
wearing very little clothes and
parading around erotically, wearing
quite a few clothes but having them
taken off by hunky males and
wearing kinky clothes but grabbing
her crotch. Most of them are,
'interesting' I think is the word, and
possibly funny to look at, except a
selection which last for four pages.
These are Madonna 'with' that
wanker of wankers, Vanilla Ice.
Gone are the shavings on the side
of his head but this still doesn't
change the fact that he is a wanker.
So, is it worth £25? For Madonna
fans such as myself, I think it is.
You get an amusing 6-odd page
comic at the back, a version of the
song 'Erotica' on CD, which is only
available if you buy the book, plus
you get the book itself. If you're
curious as to what all the
controversy surrounding this book
is about: simply ask someone with
a copy for quick look (NB A quick
look can last about half an hour).
For the perverse: spend the £25 on
a bunch of porno mags and/or a
couple of dirty videos.
Hard Harry
is low so perhaps for people that
have heard the scare stories in the
media it may prove enlightening. I
suppose they couldn't have put
more information in for fear that
people might try it out. Shame
really.
