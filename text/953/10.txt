Out of the Ashes...
Phillip Henry resurrects Imperial's old flame
The Phoenix is the Imperial College
arts magazine, a magazine of high
pedigree which was established in
the last century by H.G. Wells and
has continued in one form or
another to this day. Alas, its
frequency has dropped off of late.
In theory, it should appear once
every year but, there was a two year
period of gestation before the last
and no editor has been assigned to
the task of producing the next.
Despite one person volunteering
for the post (namely, Samin Ishtiaq
who contributed a large amount of
material to last years Phoenix) it
must be publicised so that others
may, if they wish, aspire to the
dizzying heights of Phoenix editor.
The position offers a great deal
in the way of exercising one's
organisational abilities,
communication skills and, for those
of a more artistic bent, one's
creative powers, while those of a
more mercenary disposition will
find that the editorship of the
college arts magazine looks great on
your C V . In addition, you get to
know, love and work along with the
incredibly talented, motley
individuals that make up the Felix
crew. As if all this were not enough
to entice you to volunteer for the
post, though it be a veritable wealth
of features, you also get a tankard
with your name engraved on it! You
can even drink out of it if you're
feeling paricularly brave.
However, life is not all rosy for
the Phoenix editor; it has to be said
that there is a lot of work involved.
Not too much as to force you to
completely abandon your degree -
I just about got a 2-1 last year - but
there is still a lot of work. But, this
is not the worst, oh no. The worst
part of the job is, aside from the
worthy few who spoil you for
choice with their material, trying to
get five thousand apathetic sods to
do something artistic - a story, a
poem, a photo... anything. Not an
easy task; in fact it's downright
frustrating to be honest, but I'm
afraid that will be your lot.
All of these trials and tribulations
are outweighed, however, when at
last, after months of anxiety and
labour, your baby is finally
delivered and hundreds, maybe
thousands of copies are printed,
collated and sent out into the big
wide world. When thousands of
minds are reading your work, there
isn't a thrill to compare.
I now proffer an example of the
kind of poetry that has made recent
Phoenices. It's not necessarily
depressing laments on the theme of
death, its inevitability and bleakness
etc. On the contrary, the more
simple submissions tend to be the
most memorable. For example, I've
been asked to provide an extract
from an old Phoenix and having
read the past ten or so this clever
poem by anjana ahuja stands out.
Mr. A. Hall
My Albert has been sitting thus, Ere
my life here begun, Each dusk he's
there observing, The setting of the sun.
My Albert's very tall you know,
Extremely wide and round, Although
I'm sure he'd bellow well, He doesn't
make a sound.
I like to sit and watch my Albert,
From my little home, His head is so
precisely curved, It's almost like a
dome.
To weather he seems immune, I've
never seen him flinch, Come rain,
snow, hail and sleet, He doesn't budge
an inch. He sits so steady and so
staunch, So purposeless and still, He's
never moved while I've been here, An
I guess he never will.
