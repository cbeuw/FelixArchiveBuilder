Need a Career? ICU can help!
John Simpson explains how to plan yourfuture and experience the unearth
pleasures of Imperial College Union
'How do I acquire Personal
Transferable Skills?' may not be the
first question you ask yourself in Da
Vinci's. But, the Sabbaticals would
be delighted if you decided to spend
more time making use of other ICU
facilities - as well as the bar!
Personal Transferable Skills
In a survey of employers a few
years ago, to which over eighty
responded, the following emerged
as the main Personal Transferable
Skills most sought after in
graduates:
- Identify Problems, Pose Solutions
- Work in Teams
- Communicate - Speech - Writing
- Numerical Skills
- Adaption to change
- Creative thinking
- Good Appearance
- Leadership Skills
- Self Management
Good Appearance may strike you
as the odd one out. What it means
is that you have taken the trouble
to make the most of yourself and
dressed appropriatly to the occasion
- such as an interview.
Taking Part
So if these are the qualities that
empolyers are seeking, how do you
set out to acquire them? Although
some abilities may be innate, many
skills can be developed though
practise and experiance. This is
where you can benefit by taking
part in one or more of the many
activities organised by ICU. This
does not mean that you always have
to aim to be president, Chair or
Captian of the society or Club; any
position of responsiblity will help
you gain useful experience. And
even just taking part will develop
your skills of working with people.
Knowing Yourself
'I don't need a shrink', I hear you
say. Of course not! But it does help
to understand what you are good at
and what you enjoy, what skills,
abilities interests and values you
have; because these are the starting
points for chooosing a career.
The Careers Service has work
books and computer aided careers
guidance - P R O S P E C T and
GRADSCOPE - to enable you to
match your profile with those of a
large number of different
occupations. And you can always
arrange to see a Careers Adviser for
a quick query between 1.00 and
2.00 pm or book a longer
discussion. So you have no excuse
for saying that you haven't a clue
what you want to do next.
Skills to develop
Your course should encourage you
to develop many of the important
skills, such as analysing,
calculating, drawing, investigating,
evaluating, designing and
diagnosing.
ICU Societies and Clubs can also
help you to develop some the other
important skills such as writing,
editing, decision-making, planning,
synthesising ideas and lateral
thinking.
Start today
Make a New Year's resolution,
start planning today how you are
going to acquire a complete
education - before you have
completed your education.
Communication
If you can't communicate, you are
at a severe disadvantage in life. You
really do need to be able to express
yourself adequately both in writing
and in speech. Contributing to
committee meetings will give you
the self confidence to speak up and
to express your views in a group.
Making a presentation is another
important skill. In business and
Industry you may spend more time
communicating to people than in
calculating equations, so practice
now is well worthwhile.
