Turning over a new leaf
Felix turns the in-joke into an art form as it quizzes ICU for its new
year's resolutions.

room for more gin. Unfortunately,
not everyone agreed with his choice

included, less involvement with

resolutions this year having
committed not to make any more
last year. Although he is
considering toning down his
language and saying something nice
about Broadsheet, but then again...
As the first rays of sunlight from the
new year, drift lazily over the
horizon, how many of us vow to
approach the following 365 days
better than any other? This year we
will eat less, exercise more, work
harder and remember everyone's
birthdays. But, how long do these
good intentions last? How can it be
that you are the only one to make
promises every year and then break
them moments later?
To prove our readers are not
alone in wishing for, and failing to
get the unattainable, Felix
commissioned a mini survey of the
great and the good of Imperial
College, asking what they had
bound themselves to for the next
year.
The Entire College
Imperial, a college of the University
of London gave a united
undertaking to eat less chocolate in
1993. Every person questioned by
our intrepid reporters gave the same
reply. How such a consensus was
arrived at is still unclear, and
reports that mind altering drugs
have been introduced into the water
supply were not denied. A
Cadbury's salesman was later
unavailable for comment.
Chris Davidson, ICU President
Never one to understate his case,
Chris observed 'When you're this
perfect you don't make resolutions'.
This was modified to a promise to
'take no shit from journalists'. An
admirable thought, but to be kept
for how long? Watch other parts of
this issue of Felix for the answer.
Rick Bilby. ICU Deputy Dog
Rick was unfortunately unable to
remember any resolutions he may
have made. In his cognisant
absence, we have filled the gaping
hole. A regular shave would not go
amiss, neither would a hair cut and
he is not alone in that. A full
physical overhaul would be out of
the question of course, but it can't
be too much to ask, for him to
shrink a couple of inches? Another
bright idea was to enrol the amiable
chap in an assertiveness training
course, always comes in handy for
wrestling those extra few pennies
out of college.
Dominic Wilkinson, Honorary
Secretary (Ents)
Fashion guru and inspiration to the
proletariate, Dom decided to 'do
everything I did last year in a
different colour'. As long as you get
rid of the public school tie, no one
will object Dom.
In a vain attempt to identify with
the underclass, Dom also suggested
drinking less beer in order to make
Andy Kerr Ents Chair
Wanting to have the most original
pledge, Andy gave his word of
honour to eat less chocolate and
sniff less Tipex. As Imperial bans
Tipex in all its departments, what
were you doing with it in the first
place, Andy?
Possibilities are in the air that
Andy may be allowed to re-enter
Dominic Wilkinson's Office after
their little tiff over Christmas,
however this was not reported to be
on Andy's list of things to do.
Steven Newhouse, SCC Chair,
UFC Chair, Alternative
Prospectus and Handbook Editor
Steve was considering a PhD in his
spare time, but worries that it may
interfere with his chocolate
consumption. The only man at
Imperial to be increasing his intake
of cocoa this year, he offers no
credence to the rumour that Nestle
share prices dip when he is asleep.

Felix's acerbic columnist made no
Sara Abdulla
For Sara, the light of the artistic life
in Felix, less is more. Out of the
Window goes chocolate, excess
weight and nail biting. In comes
waistlines, conscientious working
and compulsory breaking of new
years resolutions.
Rebecca Land, Alternative
Prospectus and Handbook Editor
Top of Beccy's list was the vow not
to stand for any sabbatical posts.
Will she break it? One and all will
have to wait until the 19th of
February to find out.
Ian Hodge
The Felix office lounge lizard, Ian
took a predictably oblique view on
the subject of New Year traditions.
T don't see why we celebrate it' he
moaned 'It's just a day like every
other. Anyway we use the wrong
calender, there is lots of other New
Years to chose from' What calender
Ian preferred was not made clear,
but we can only presume it was
from this planet, and not any other.
Your new diet? Or what you hoped it would be?
