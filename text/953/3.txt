Opinion
Felix 953 15 January 1993
Editorial
Calcutt
It is terrifying for me and a few
other people that this week's widely
advertised leak of the Calcutt report
into Press Freedom, has had such
little reaction. But, hang on a
minute, we have all heard Kelvin
MacKenzie, Andrew Neil and Peter
Preston sounding off about their
respective newspapers, some of
them even spoke exclusively to
Imperial College Radio, surely we
have had too much about this issue.
But, gentle reader what do you
think, you who go out and spend
your grant cheque on these papers,
what do you think, are you even
worried that freedom of the press
is about to be seriously curtailed?
Do you think that the media has
brought this fate upon itself? And
are you even bothered?
It is easy to criticise the papers
that you read for harassment,
misreporting and bias, yet you still
read them, even at Imperial College
I have no difficulty believing that
tabloid papers are by far and away
the most widely taken. Can we
criticise papers who print pictures
of naked royals, when we go out
and buy them? It is us who
encourage this behaviour, when the
great and mighty battle this one out
in TV, Radio and Newspaper, bear
in mind what you want to read and
if you would really be effected by
changes in the law. Make your
voice heard before it's too late.
Totes Toasties
Have Totes Toasties a controlling
interest in Christmas? The brightly
coloured thermal sock was the main
Christmas present to the entire
country, everyone I know got a
pair. Do they control all the
grannies and aunts that have no idea
what to buy you for C h r i s t m a s ?
Something is up and I recommend
that they are investigated by the
Monopolies and Mergers
commision for more than a 20%
control in the festive season.
Wanted
Felix offers the chance to see
every play or film in London,
before it is released to the general
public. It remains a source of
concern that this is not jumped upon
by every student here. Because
there is only a limited number of
people in the Felix office at any
given time, we have too many
events and too few people to cover
them. This means that opportunities
for free tickets get needlessly
wasted and the pages of your
esteemed college organ become
empty white space, or facile waffle.
You can help rectify this
situation, all it requires is for you
to walk through the door to the
Felix office in the left hand side of
Beit Quad, and ask for Sara, Mario
or Jonty. The rewards are without
limit, and the price, just a little bit
of self confidence.

Cat's Eyes
Happy New, Ermm?
I cannot think of a damn thing to
write about. I sit at the word-
processor, my fingers are frozen
above the keyboard, twitching as
they anticipate to jump to a certain
key. Frantically scanning my mind
for a topic, the only one that I
manage to locate is lunch: a jacket
potato, with some coke (the drink,
that is).
I could blame the start of term
exams. This would be a feasible
proposition if significantly more
effort was put into them. I could
blame the holidays, arguing that I
had revised like mad or completed
mountains of work, but alas, I
can't.
Wait, an idea! I think I'll write
a bit about last year's Cat's Eyes.
All the top notch journalists reflect
on the previous year's work at the
start of a new year, so why not me?
OK then, so can I remember what
I wrote, without referring to past
Felices? Hmmm. One subject that
cropped up more often than not was
that CCU mag. A childish argument
began when it published a one page
piss take of Felix. The not-much-
of-a climax of this quarrel came at
the end of the term when, after
refusing to be interviewed by them,
they demonstrated how to fill blank
pages with a photocopier and an
issue of Felix.
One of the subjects I regret
mentioning was about space-filling.
Since then, some of spaces that have
had to be filled in Felix were done
so that it was deliberately obvious
that that space had to be filled. At
the time I felt I was partly to blame
for this. Anyway, now I see that
there is nothing wrong with the
occasional space filler. Nope. Not
a thing. Absolutely nowt wrong
with that masterful, creative,
ingenious technique. No, it's not a
technique, but a skill, yes a skill,
there is absolutely nowt wrong with
that masterful, creative, ingenious
skill in modern journalism that is
commonly known as space-filling.
I think that's enough about the
past since I have little space left to
mention two subjects that have
emerged unexpectedly.
The first is censorship. Top Gun
has a certificate of 15, because of
the swearing and sex scene between
Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis (or
is it McGilis?). Then when it was
advertised as 'family
entertainment,' and scheduled for
an early evening screening, I
became curious. What was a bloody
good film became something that
looked like it was put together by
a drunken production team: swear
words dubbed out, the voice over
that was provided for some didn't
match the lip movement and the
entire sex scene, such as it was, was
gone. Why do ITV and the BBC
insist on chopping up films?
Channel Four don't, but I think
that's because they need extras like
sex scenes to attract viewers.
Will the BBC hack up Parenthood
this Saturday? Will the scene with
the vibrator be cut? Although it is
on three hours later than Top Gun
was, you never know.
I don't think I have enough room
left for a lengthy bit about
surrealism, the other emerged
subject. All I will say is that most
surrealism is generally rubbish and
why are fish strongly associated
with this style of art?
