Do a lot of throwing up over New
Year? Did you throw your food up
in any particular order? Did you
regurgitate live goldfish and billiard
balls? If you answered yes to all the
above questions, then chances are,
your name is Stevie Starr and
you're appearing at Imperial
College Union this Friday (15th
January).
Yes, the regurgitating sensation
who has appeared on TV shows all
over the world, (The Jonathan Ross
Show, the Arsenio Hall Show, etc.)
is appearing in the Union tonight.
He has a unique talent for
swallowing many objects and
bringing them back up to order.
You can witness this revolting yet
very entertaining experience for the
amazing discount price of £2. Yes
£2!!
Tickets will be limited. Buy now
to avoid disappointment. On stage
at 10.30pm.
New Year Carnival is coming to
your screens on Friday 22nd
January. The headline band in the
Concert Hall are Jamiroquai. Fresh
from a sell-out show at the Town
& Country Club at £10 a ticket,
they are currently the hottest band
on the dance scene at the minute.
They were awarded best single of
the year by The Face magazine, one
of the Top 20 dance singles in
Melody Maker and they were also
one of the bands tipped to be HUGE
in 1993 by Melody Maker.
They're a ten piece Acid Jazz
band, very much in the same vein
as The Brand New Heavies and the
James Taylor Quartet. Special
support will be announced nearer
the date.
In the Union Lounge will be 3 'A
Minutes. This indie rock band have
recently supported Suede and
Kingmaker, and they are tipped by
the NME to make it big this year.
They received single of the week
with their debut single and are
currently appearing on an NME
compilaton of the singles of 1992.
They're very hot and you won't
want to miss them.
Also there's a bar until 2am,
disco until 3am and Smile Zone
happy hour (all drinks 20% off)
from 8.30-10.0pm.

Patriot Games
For its first film of 1993, Film
Society is proud to present Patriot
Games, a recent box office success
in both the U K and America.
The film, based on a novel by
Tom Clancey, is an action thriller
starring Harrison Ford as Jack
Ryan, a retired CIA field agent who
now works as an analyst and
lecturer.
Ryan, a character you may
remember from The Hunt for Red
October, is visiting the U K , and
becomes involved in an
assassination attempt by the IRA on
a prominent member of the Royal
family. Ryan manages to foil the
plot, and in doing so kills one of the
assassins. From this moment on,
there is an IRA vendetta against him
and his family; the dead terrorist's
brother is to track Ryan down and
avenge his brother's death. It has
been suggested that Jack Ryan could
be the James Bond of the nineties,
and if this first film is anything to
go by, the character certainly has
the style and charisma to be Bond's
modern day equivalent. So
remember, his name's Ryan...Jack
Ryan!
The film will be shown, as usual,
in Mech Eng 220 on Thursday 21st
January at 7.30pm. Membership is
now down to only £3.50, with the
first film free. Otherwise, entry is
90p for members and £1.90 for
non-members.
So how much would you expect
to pay for this full night's
entertainment? £10. No. £5. No.
I'm robbing myself blind here. We
have cut the price to an amazing
£3.50 advance, £4 on the door.
