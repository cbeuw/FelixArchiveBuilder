Dear Jonty,
Saturday night, the 28th
November was the night which all
Singaporeans ought to be proud of,
a night in which the Singaporean
flag flew high. 'Singapuro Exotica',
a variety show involved practically
all Singaporeans at IC (about 90 of
them), with five months of vigorous"
practice, was a huge success.
I wish to take this opportunity to
look into several points which I feel
strongly about:
1. The overall quality of the
show was high. Much effort and
energies had been channelled into
the experimental multi-media
performance, which is
commendable. The show was
successful in recreating an
allegorical journey through the last
centuries of Singapore, as well as
the colourful cultural performances.
There is one sincere rationale
behind this versatility. The
objectives of the show were to
promote the interchange of cultural
interest and at the same time,
introduce the country to the
international community.
The success of the show should
be seen as a beacon of achievement
to encourage further emulation to
the international community.
2. The positive attitute of the
Singaporean. The Sing. Soc has
come a long way, from overcoming
the conceptual hurdles to the final
product. To pick up just one of the
many examples. Weeks before the
'Singapura Exotica', a daily stall
was set up in the concourse area of
the Sherfield Building, and was
backed up by a performance of a
precision drill in the JCR. Its final
attempt to boost the ticket sales was
retarded by the unfortunate incident
which brought the overseas week to
a premature close. The sale of the
tickets was less than satisfactory,
even until 24 hours before the actual
show.
The imminent disaster, however,
did not demoralise the Singaporean.
A daundess spirit, best put by Baron
de Coubertin, 'the essential thing in
life is not conquering but fighting
well', was shown by all. Luckily,
the show was a great sell out.
3. The role of the overseas
student in promoting their
respective cultures. For many
countries, large sums of money
have been invested in expensive
programmes for development of the
human resources to the highest
order. One such programme is the
continuous sending of students to
study in technologically advanced
countries, like Britain. It is
therefore of paramount importance
that these 'elite' should shoulder the
responsibility of promoting their
respective countries and cultures, as
well as the pursuit of academic
excellent. For one thing, each and
everyone is the most qualified
cultural ambassador of the country,
and speaks better than any tourist-
guide brochures.
I was fortunate to have a brief
encounter with the Minister of Arts,
Culture and Tourism of Malaysia,
during his official visit to this
country three weeks ago. He
expressed great interest when told
that the Malaysian society was
putting on a cultural performance.
He even offered much advice and
sent his best wishes to the
participants. The point I want to
make here is that, quite often, these
students are unaware of the
expectation and importance attached
to such cultural activities by their
fellow countrymen.
4. The implication of such
cultural activities in the broad
sense. With about twenty five
percent of students from overseas,
IC students enjoy the privilege to
have the opportunity to explore
other cultures in depth. Cultural
activities as such provide forums on
the cultural pursuit and
achievements of their countries.
Constant contact and exchange of
culture would engender mutually
enrichening cultures. I do believe
that, through such interchange (or
even exposure) would widen one's
mental horizon, and enable one to
perceive things in a fuller context.
This should form an important part
of self-education.
My stay in the U K is coming
close to four years. Over the years,
Britain (and the British) has taught
me more than just Elgar's 'Pomp
and Circumstances' or Yorkshire
Pudding. Such exposure has
provided me with, at least, the
general conception of the 'cause and
effect' system, e.g. why the British
live the ways they live etc.
As communication revolution-
ises, distances shrink, political
geography transforms and
economies lose their border. In the
advent of globalisation, an
awareness of the importance of
better undersanding through the
interchange of cultures, is the first
step towards achieving a
comprehensive vision of the world.
It is through activities such as these
that promotes the interchange of
cultural interests, and maintains
international/inter-racial goodwill
and harmony. It is hoped that
eventually a globalised, fracternal
culture will pave its way in the years
to come.
In conclusion, I would like to
urge students to take the initiative,
with an open mind approach to such
activities. Ignorance breeds
contempt and probably casts
stereotypical views on other people.
Don't let introversion over-ride
your consciousness.
Finally, I would like to express
my gratitude to all participants,
whose effort has brought us a most
enjoyable night.
Yours sincerely,
H M Kho, Civ Eng 2.
