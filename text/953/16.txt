THE BODYGUARD
When looking to see who was in the
BodyGuard, and then viewing the
name Whitney Houston, my
immediate thought was along the
lines of 'Oh shit, not another pop
star attempting to get into films!' I
then expected a performance so
wooden that the furniture in the film
would seem to have more life in it.
To my surprise I was not only
spared such a dreadful performance
but Whitney did exceedingly well
in her first film role. She remained
on top form throughout, as too did
Kevin Costner (shock of shocks),
who played the bodyguard to
Whitney.
The storyline, while tense,
exciting and romantic, eventually
leads down to a disappointing
ending that might have all softies
squeezing a tear. It has to be said
though that this is the film's only
flaw.

Theatre
L.627
Here is an earthy, uncomplicated
look at a police narcotics team in
Paris. It's a gentle, gritty study on
a violent and seedy subject. In the
main, it's about the life and drive
of a man who is trying to implement
Law 627. Here is a man with a
mission. There's no plot as such, no
glamourous thrilling detective
work, but some scenes stand out
and some stay with you awhile. It's
a difficult film for subtitles due to
the realism of the dialogue, though
it's not the dialogue that carries the
film. It's hard to say what does. Not
surprisingly, the acting is very good
especially Didier Bezace as Lulu.
Inconsequential is the word that
comes to me. There is no happy
ending for the police or the junkies,
because there is no ending. Maybe
I'm pessimistic but the film seems
to confirm the idea of that there is
no solution. For junkies, dealers,
screaming babies with spaced-out
mothers. Sad but true.

The Adventures of Mr
Broucek
The setting is Prague, circa 1920.
The central character, Mr Broucek,
is the landlord of an apartment
block; he is fat, coarse, oafish, and
disliked by his tenants. The tenor
Graham Clark carries the role
excellently—slapstick, acrobatics
and singing combined.
The production is a characteristic
product of ENO's resident team of
David Pountney, producer, and
Stefanos Lazaridis, designer. It's
full of ideas, some hits, some
misses, and fans will not be
disappointed; the motifs of mid-air
beds, horses and expressionist sets
are back again. In the past, I've
been annoyed by their tendency to
'over-produce', their ideas
intruding on the central music and
drama. Here though because the
music is relatively weak the
production is the thing that gives the
performance life.
This being the pantomime season
ENO are promoting Broucek as a
family opera, suitable for all. This
may be true of Act I: the humour
is a bit superior, but everyone can
appreciate the weird, bright
costumes and scenery. Act II is a
different kettle of fish. Children,
and more than children, will be
puzzled by the symbolic goings-on.
Hardly 'Aladdin and the Three
Beakstalks' at the Penge Coliseum,
but worth seeing.
