The first few weeks of Aut-
umn Term must be the most
hectic period in- the College
year. A l l the Union officers,
from the President down are
rushing about, trying to find
out \exactly what it is that
they are supposed to be org-
anising, and attempting to do
same. A l l this under the
strain imposed by the sheer
numbers of freshers, who
make up over 40 p.c. of the
College this year. Perhaps,
it would be an idea to change
Administrations at Easter so
as to give the new officers the
whble of Ithe 'summer Term
to prepare for the New Session.
H o w do the freshers find
the College? The official re-
ception, as official (functions
often do, may have been a lit-
tle boring, especially for the
post-graduate freshmen. The
Union Officers had little to add
to what was already i n the
Blue Book and in F E L I X , but
they took their time saying it
Hoiw many freshers, I won-
der, have accepted the Presid-
ent's invitation to meet him
in the Union Office. They
would be lucky indeed to find
him there, and luckier still to
receive a helpul response from
the other occupants of this
double doored sanctuary.
Forutnately not many fresh-
men have attempted to invade
the Union Office; the little
spajre ifene they do have is
spent queuing for a meal in
the refectories. The tempor-
ary refectory system seems to
be sorting itself ont, though
there is a suspicion that thp
landlord of 'The Queen' is tht.
principal beneficiary • of the
'Seafood Plan'.
Do women like I C ? This
may appaer to be a silly que-
stion in view of the large num-
bers turned away from the
Saturday Hops, but what does
I C W A think about the fe-
males' position in the College?
And why has there been a drop
in the number of female stud-
ents at I C this year? Could
it be that women do not want
to come to I C , that they have
heard that we are a college, of
beer drinking louts, where wo-
m(e.n are 'seem (or should I
say stared at) but never heard
and generally ignored? Let's
face it, the general attitude to
ICWAri'ans in the Union
eaves much to be desired. It
.s not improper to smile at a
woman whom you meet every
day, to open a door for a
woman who crosses your path
m
> the Union. A bit- more
chivalry about the place will
do much to improve our re-
putation.
In the field of sports it looks
as if - we were , set for another
good year. The Eugby, Soc-
cer and Hockey Clubs were
well satisfied with their trials,
despite the strike set back.
Can we possibly repeat the
splendid feat of 1960 and win
the Triple Crown?
Q U O T E S O F T H E W E E K
I can't think of any scandal
just right, now.

Someone has been undressing
in the Union Office, and I
wasn't even there.
Mrs. Eob
I know when someone is sexy,
but I don't know what it
means.

one at that—Ed).

In January 1962 the three
authors of this article con-
ceived the idea of an Imper-
ial College mountaineering und
scientific expedition in the,
summer of 1963, and after
publicising the idea thoughout
College a group was formed
to carry out detailed planning
for such a project. Eight
months later the decision to
abandon the expedition was
forced on the organisers be-
cause of the complete refusal
Of the College Exploration
Board to assist or encourage
the expedition in any respect,
financial or otherwise. This
account of the event which
led to this decision is presented
in the hope that it will en-
courage the Exploration Board
to give a clear statement of
the policies which guide its
decisions.
The proposals were for an
expedition, including seven
members of the College with
an external leader and doctor,
to be sent to the Karakoram
(Pakistan) i n June 1963. In
the final arrangements the ex-
pedition was to be led by M r .
Chris Bdnnington. with D r .
J i m Swallow as medical of-
ficer, both having Himalayan
experience and both being
Expedition to Jan Mayen, 1963
It is intended to mount
another expedition to Jan
Mayen Island in the summer
of 1963. This expedition will
be known as the Imperial Col-
lege Beerenberg Expedition.
1963. Its aim is to continue
and extend the studies carried
out by Imeprial College par-
ties in 1938, 1959 and 1961.
The main work of the ex-
pedition will again be glacio-
logieal, but extensive botanical
and geological programmes will
also be carried out. A n inter-
esting archeological problem
also awaits solution. The ex-
pedition will take twelve men,
seven of whom have been
chosen. Those already selected
are all postgraduates with ex-
perience of scientific work i n
the Artie.
People who are interested in
joining the expedition should
contact J . W . Sheard through
the Union Back. W e will par-
ticularly welcome enquires
from first and second year
| 'students.

willing to contribute substan-
tially towards the cost of the
project. The main scientific
objective was to survey and
map an unexplored area. In
addition, geological and lnet-
eorological work was to have
been carried out. The clim-
bing objective was to be on<»
of three major unclimhed
peaks i n the area, if reoona:s-
sance established any reasonable
routes.
The practicability of t h i
proposals rested on the pr.>-
sense i n College of sufficiently
experienced men to carr; out
the expedition work comp'fet'j-
ly and safely.
One possible selection of the
seven College members, for
example, would include;
1. three members each with
two season alpine exper-
ience.
2. two members with arctic
expedition experience.
3. four members with exten-
sive experience of survey
work;
4. four geologists, including
one research geologist.
The organisers had, the act-
ive assistance and support of
Mr. Joseph Walmsey, leader of
the 1957 Masherbrum Exped-
ition, and Group Captain.
Tony Smyth, leader of the
1961 E . A . F . Expedition, both
of whom visited the area se-
