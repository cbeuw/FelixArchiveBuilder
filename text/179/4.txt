1 This theory is very soon to
g be put to the test. As the
S photographs accompanying this
f§ article show, we have come a
f§ long way since that day when
S the first plans of the South
g Halls were announced, and de-
1 spite various hold-ups, the
3 the first plans of the South Side
= of Prince's Gardens is sched-
1 uled to come into operation
3 early in the new year. Once
s completed, South Side will pro-
| vide hostel accommodation for
H 384 students plus a host of other
S facilities.
1 The hostel part of South
3 Side will occupy the eight up-
= per floors, the 'penthouse
H suites' on the very top provid-
H ing four flats for the four War-
s dens. Four are required be-
ll cause the hostel will for ad-
S ministrative resasons, be split
j | up into four Halls, namely
§ Selkirk, Falmouth, Tizard and
Keogh Halls. The four War-
dens will be M r . C. C. Seaford,
Dr. K . E . Weale, Dr. A .
Cameron, and Dr. J . B . Butler.
The two.Halls at the east end
of the building will hold 120
students each, while the west
end ones will be somewhat
smaller, holding 72 students
each, until such time as the
adjoining leases expire, and the
building can be extended to
its full length. The eight hos-
tel floors are split horizontally
into two sets of three floors,
each with its associated 'com-
munal floor' where there will
be such facilities as a laundry
(equipped with Bendix mach-
ines), a games room, a 'quiet'
room, possibly a committe
room and a galley for cooking.
The rooms in each three level
tier are built on the Oxbridge
staircase model, being grouped
round a succession of stair-
mm
A view along one of the
cases, each landing opening on-
to eight rooms, with centrally
placed washroom and toilet
facilities. The study bed-
rooms, which are to be decor-
ated and furnished according
to a plan which was agreed to
after consultation with the
Union, will be equipped with,
among other things, thirteen
amp sockets.
Below the hostel floors,
there will be three floors de-
voted to the College and the
Union at large. Two student
refectories are envisaged, seat-
ing 150 and 350 respectively,
one staff dining room, a staff
buttery, a snack bar, a student
and a staff common room, and
last but not least, a student
buttery and a mixed bar. This
last item will at last (per-
haps) silence the age old ar-
guments for and against the
'women bar' in the Union
