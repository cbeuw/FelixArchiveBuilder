graphic and survey material
was very kindly made avail-
able to the organisers by these
two gentlemen, and before
entering the field the expedit-
ion would have had the max-
imum possible relevent infor-
mation compiled from these
ajnd |ot>her sources. Encour-
agement was also recei'/od
from M r . Wilfred Noyce and
Professor F . I. Finch, ex-Pre-
sident of the Alpine Club.
The following documents re-
lating to the expedition we
available for inspection ;—
1. The proposals submitted to
the Exploration Board.
2. A comprehensive outline of
the project submitted to the
Pakistan Government.
3. Individual reports on (i)
the survey programme (ii)
the geological programme
(iii) the meteorological pro-
gramme (iv) the climbing
programme.
4. A comprehensive report on
the financing of the exped-
ition.
5. Maps and photographic
material.
An application for support
and a grant of £1,200 was
submitted to the Exploration
Board in June, and was consid-
ered at a meeting held on 21st
June 1962. (The 1957 Kara-
koram Expedition received a
grant of £3,025 and the 1959
Apolobamba Expedition ap-
plied for £1,500 and received
£1,000.) The minutes of the
Board meeting record "The
Board was generally satisfied
with its (the Expedition's)
programme, organisation and
proposed leadership". How-
ever, the organisers were in-
formed on June 22nd that " a l -
though the board approved the
intentions and was impressea
by the ability of the organis-
ers it regrettied jtthat i t w*as
unable ibo Idevote so large a
part of its resources . . . to
(the) Expedition".
The Boards inability to he!'
to finance the Expedition ap-
pears rather difficult to undei-
stand in the light of the re-
serve fund of some £600 which
the Board has accumulated
over recent years. There
seems to be no corresponding
difficulty in the financing of
a succession of major arctic
expedition, the despatch ot
which would appear to have
become an annual event,
while on the other hand the
Board has not supported a
mountaineering and scientific
expedition since 1959.
Even accepting the Board's
contention that its financial
situation is weak, it must have
been evident that the proposed
Karakoram Expedition, con.
sidering the support it was re-
ceiving from outside College,
would have stood a very good
chance of going out in substan- J
tially the same form (at the ex. *
pense of an increased organis- »
ational effort), given the en- J
couragement of the Board and }
a reduced grant. However, the '
Board refused the organisers >
even formal approval, and dis- j
puted the uae of the words j
"Imperial College" in the E x - >
pedition name. This amounts, t
in effect, to a veto of the pro- !
ject as no outside body will ;
support a College Expedition ;
which is disowned by the Col-
lege Exploration Board.
This sequence of event con-
trasts strangely with the pre-
scribed objects of the Board
"to encourage initiative on the
part of all members of the U n -
ion in organising scientific ex-
peditions".
It was an expedition origin-
ating from Mountaineering
Club circles to the Karakoram
which led directly to the for-
mation of the Exploration
Board in 1955. Are such act-
ivities to be excluded in future
from the scope of the Board's
work? if this is the case should
not the Board make public a
statement to this effect for tht
benefit of-would-be organisers?
In any case, should not thb
Board make available to mem-
bers of the Union (by whom
it is partially financed) en
unambiguous statement of the
principles which guide its dis-
posal annually of some £1,300?

The Art Club has been flour-
ishing for four years now. It
gives I.C. students a chance
to paint and draw from mod-
els, with expert tuition and at
low cost. We meet ever
Wednesday between 2.30 p.m.
and 5.30 p.m. in one of the
studios of the Royal College of
Art in Exhibition Road. We
use the models hired by R C A
who also supply the materials.
There is a charge of 4 shillings
a session, everything included,
the greater part of the cost
being born by the College.
Connie Fenn, former scholar
of the RCA, is the tutor.
Officially the club packs up
'. at the end of the Lent Term,
[ however, last year during the
; Summe r Term the members
• did some landscape painting.
'. As there was a sufficient num-
', ber of Londoners we carried on
| painting during the vacs.
Apart from visits to exhibit-
ions, the club held a fifty
painting exhibition of its own
in the Physics building at the
end of the Summer Term.
If you want to make a ser-
ious attempt at this difficult
business of life painting or just
want to dabble in paint one
odd afternoon, we should be
glad to see you.
