After a long period of work and preparation, face-lifting
and wall cleaning, the great day finally came, and the College op-
ened its doors to an alltime record number of clean, bright
cheeked and best-dressed freshmen (and some freshwomen too).
Every autumn there seems to be more and more of them and this
year was no exception. Official! figures have not yet been released,
but a good estimate is that the intake was of some thirteen hun-
dred freshers, of w h o m between five and six hundred were post-
graduate. The number of postgraduates is always uncertain as
many of these come from overseas and often turn up at the last
minute, but i n general, an increase of from 5 to 10% is expected
in all round numbers.
The President addresses freshmen.
The day started with seper-
ate reception for post- and un.
der-graduates, at which fresh-
men were addressed by
the Rector, members of
the Academic staff and
Union Officers. The Rec-
tor gave some details of the
College rebuilding scheme, an
idea of what the College stood
for in the field of Science and
Technology, and some good ad-
vice about Union activities
("Don't join all 80 clubs, no
matter how high-pressure their
recruiting, methods'-'). As

far as the the one day rail
strike was concerned, the Rector
suggested a revised version of
that famous motto; 'the Col-
lege never closes'.
The Student Officers followed
this with a somewhat more
lighthearted approach, suggest-
ing among other things a high
failure raee (one in three)
and a high rate of loss of bach-
elorhood. This latter is in the
nature of an occupational haz-
ard for members of the Royal
College of Science, as the vast
majority of our young ladies
seem to prefer pure science to
engineering.
The reception was followed
by a buffet lunch, and the fre-
shers were then fct loose in the
Union Building" and left to the
mercy of the College Clubs
and Societies, which judging
by advance reports, made the
most of the opportunity to get
new blood. Not only the Rug-
by, Soccer and Boat Clubs, but
also such Societies as the R C S
Literary Society attracted
large numbers.
What the wastage rate will
be is somewhat uncertain, but ,
it seems like â€¢ being a record
year.
ROYAL B0OMALAKA
(Now It can be told.)
T h e visit to Silwood by the first year Ciyils for the annual two
week imbibing session, cunningly disguised under the name of
'fidd course', always causes quite a stir in the neighbourhood,
but this year, a n i p p l e from the local stir went even further.
It' was discovered that a
Royal Entourage left Wind-
sor Castle every day, and
passed along part of the Sil-
wood Park boundary on its way
to the Ascot race course. A c -
cordingly a trusty ' band of
about 40 engineers, led by their
redoubtable chief, Pete Grif-
fiths (who wishes to' remain
anonvmous) collected at a
suitable spot" on the road used
by the said cavalcade. A
small setback was encountered,
in the shape of a large photo-
grapher, who finding a large
collection of assorted cream of
British youth occupying what
he claimed to be his pitch, be-
came so incensed that he
threatenend the scruffiest pre-
sent, one R - d J-n-s, with
violence. Discreet glowerings
and muttering, however, caused
him to desist.
The approach of the Royal
party was heralded by two
mofar cvcle patrolmen, :wiho
would not have looked out of
place i n an A l Capone film,
one of them coming close to
running over the toes of the
unfortunate engineer whose
foot just overhung the grass
verge. Immediately behind
them came an open landau
containing the Queen and
Pince Phillip. With beautiful-
ly precise timing, M r . P.
Griffiths led a lusty Booma-
laka, which reached a climax
just as the landau was along-
side. The cheering complete-
ly drowned the welcoming cries
of the local villagers, and un-
fortunately caused one the
liveried mounted outriders to
loose his passive mark of in-
difference as his horse bolted
up the heflge copse1
. Apart
from this, the Boomalaka was
warmly received, Prince Phil-
lip and Lord Snowdon smil-
ing and waving.
Shattered by their vocal ef-
forts, the temporary residents
of Silwood staggered back to
a local hostelry to re-lubricate
their vocal cords.
