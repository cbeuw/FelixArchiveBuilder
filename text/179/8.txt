M O R P H Y D A Y
T H R E E mornings a week the Boat House rocks to the tune of
M o r p h y training. W h e n most students are sensibly lying i n bed,
the more active section of thei College can be seen on the river i n
support of their respective college. Training is progressing well
despite early morning fogs and D r . Beeching and a fast, close
race can be expected.
Though o n paper, the R C S M o r p h y appear the more ex-
perienced crew, Guilds have a powerful eight Which will take a
lot o,f beating. F e w people i n their right m i n d would comment
on the look of the Mines Boat. T h e L o w r y crews look fast com-
pared with previous years and here again a good race can be pre-
dicted.
If however, y o u have no interest i n the finer arts of row-
ing, come along o n the 7th to support your College i n the biggest
battle since the '61 G a l a . Dress (clothes) is optional, and tickets
are on sale at any Underground Station. T h e latter are, however
rarely distributed due to lack of co-operation between the L . T . E .
and police departments.
T h e Boat C l u b has recruited a record number of freshers
and is commencing a monster programme of mass-instruction.
Helped b y this and tib©4arge number of last year's crews who were
allowed back by higher authorities, the C l u b expects to maitain
the high standard of recent years.

Dawn at Lasham on July 1st
saw the start of the first IC
Gliding Club expedition to
Cambridge. Three cars and
two trailers coped with the par-
ty of seven and our two air-
craft, an Eagle two seater and
a solo Skylark 2 (Phoenix).
In true gliding tradition, the
Monday broke wet and windy,
and was declared a non-con-
lest day, while punting in
the afternoon soon degenerated
inJ
.o bird-watching on the river
banks. The weather on Tues-
day proved not much better,
but short distances were co-
vered, Phoenix winning the
clay by a small margin.
Wednesday's sky followed the
same '.rend, but previous ex-
perience suggested that it was
soarable under the eight-
eigths strato-cumulus (rather
cloudy). The small gain of
500 feet after release was
judged sufficient to set
course across the beshad-
owed. Cambridgeshire coun-
tryside. The Cambridge Sky-
lark 2, however, had the
misfortune to end up against
la large tree i n a very small
field.
With the competition's forces
reduced to an Olympian, the
Phoenix crew sailled forth
lightheartedly, only to be well
out-flown in Thursday's murky
sky. The flame of competition
now burned more strongly, but
was firmly exstinguished on the
Friday when the Olympian
lined up accurately on a tele-
graph pole after a flight of
some 20 miles. IA saddened
opposition weite thejn treated
to an example of S—d's Law,
the weather picking up for the
weekend, allowing Phoenix to
complete 50 and 70 mile flights.
The expedition, tired but
in good spirits, arrived back at
Lasham early Monday morn-
ing, leaving Cambridge with
the the thoughts which were
subsequently expressed so well
in their news letter; " I n or-
der to win a competition, two
conditions must be fulfilled.
You must fly further than the
other people, and you must
preserve your glider intact.
Since neither of these condit-
ions were fulfilled by the Cam-
bridge Club, Imperial College
must be declared the victors."
Technical Note.
The Club is at present await-
ing the delivery of the latest
high performance single seater
glider, a Skylark 4.

AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like "the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in Y O U —• and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
