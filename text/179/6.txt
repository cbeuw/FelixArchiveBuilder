City and Guilds
Union Meeting
As., was expected, the first
C . and G. Union Meeting of
the session was a roaring suc-
cess. President Chris Liddle
and entourage entered the lec-
ture theatre to a cornet fan-
fare, and the meeting actually
managed to start on time.
The first words spoken were
a request for clemency—no to-
matoes, eggs, or flour in view
of the fact that the meeting
was in a new lecture theatre.
The routine business was
carried out, then the meeting
was informed that Dave Gil-
bert had 'donated a top hat
and^-a 6 ft long locomotive
name plate to Guilds by letter
(items not enclosed). In the
ahsence of the top hat, the
President wore a Salvation
Army hat, which saemed to
suit him quite well. Some
elections then took place, with
only one hitch—a Chemical
engineer almost being elected
as the 1st yeai Aero. rep.
The new post of P u b l i c l y
Officer finally went to Bob
Schroter after a supporting
speech by the ex-President,
Lawrie Austin. The count
was interrupted by a display
of oral gymnastics bv the Vice-
President, John White, who
half choked on several pieces
df chn.fc which -Pound bl >;i.r
way into his mouth. It was
suggested, however, that this
was ppt really a feat of
marksmanship, since one could
hardly miss such a target.
The usual plugs were given
for Morphy Day, the Lord
Mayor's Show, Guilds-Mines
Carnival, the Brighton car run,
etc. The Vice-President then
gave a little talk about mascots
and when Mitch was men-
tioned, lo and behold, there
he was under the table. This
was received With great ac-
claim, tl>e air 'being full of
vals by earsplitting bangs by

unprintable epithets and sug-

be put.
The meeting, which was
punctuated at irregular inter-
courtesy of third year Elect-
ricals, was finally closed in the
usual manner, Chris Liddle
holding the Spanner aloft for
most of the Boomalaka.
Science, Technology
and World Advancement
On Thursday, October 4th,
Professor P. M . S. Blackett,
Head of the Physics Depart-
ment and Pro Rector of Im-
perial College, gave a lunch-
time General Studies lecture
to about 100 students on the
subject of "Science, Techno-
logy and World Advance-
ment".
Introduced by the President
of the Union, Asit Chandmal,
Professor Blackett said that
the second most important
problem facing the world to-
day ; after the principal one of
whether or not the world can
avoid blowing itself to pieces,
is that only a small propor-
tion of the world's .population
has so far benefited from the
advances which science now
makes possible. H e described
the two great sub-divisions of
the human race; the 400 mil-
lion, living in Europe, " B r i t -
ain and her descendant coun-
tries; America, etc.-", with an
average per capita income of
about £400 p..a., and the re-
maining 1,000 million with an
income of perhaps £40 per
head per year. And the amaz-
ing fact is that this dichot-
omy has risen within the last
150-200 years.
The standards of life in
Europe and, say China, in the
18th century are believed to
by D . Bourne
have been about the same ; and
it is certain that the standard
of life at that time in either
of those places was little high-
er than that in Ancient Rome.
The reason for the appearance
of this phenomenal difference
jin wealth was the scientific
revolution; the wealth of those
countries involved in it soared,
that of the fathers remained
steady or even fell.
Professor Blackett went on
to show the distinction be-
tween science, and tech-
nology. B y 2,000 B . C . ,
craft technology had reached a
level which was not surpassed
in well over 3,000 years.
Slides were shown of build-
ings, |ewelery and furniture
of an extremely high standard,
both of design and execution;
a Mesopotamian temple per-
haps 6,000 year old, very so-
phisticated jewelry made 4.500
years ago and a chair from
Tutenkamen's tomb, dating
over 3,000 years. Of this lat-
ter, Professor Blackett said he
had recently seen a close copy
in an unspecified University
Hostel, where it looked not in
the least incongruous.
A slide was shown which
compared drawings of two
treadmihF-opierated cranes,
similar in design, one pre-
dating the other by 1,600
years. This was a striking i l -
lustration of the static nature
of echnology unaided by
science. The achievement of
the scientific revolution was
to provide logical explanations
for much knowledge which had
hitherto been of a purely em-
pirical character, aand by en-
abling people to understand
the principles underlying this
knowledge to suggest fresh ap-
proaches which in their turn
, nade many Viery important
innovations possible. Only
countries whose social systems
looked more favourably on in-
novation especially those of
Western Europe, thus bene-
fited from the advances made
possible; countries of a more
static nature; India and Chin?i,
for example; were rapidly left
behind.
As for the future, Professor
Blackett believes that it is vit-
al we help those countries left
behind, both with money and
with skills. Apart from the
moral reasons, we must do so
to help to support the democ-
ratic system (of government
which many of these countries
are trying. For if we do not,
they may well fall for the glit-
tering but empty promises of
Communism. This would be
a disaster, for them as for us.
In answer to questions put
to him, Professor Blacket said
that, while it was difficult to
assess, he thought that on the
whole countries cdlonised by
Britain had benefitted more
than they had been harmed.
H e also felt that the greatest
educational need for the un-
derdeveloped countries was for
secondary education, because
it actually trained people to
do the most important job of
all, namely to run the country,
