building. The hearties, booz-
ers etc. will be able to sing in
peace in the Union, while the
smothies, budding Casanovas
and more delicate members of
the student body will be able
to patrake of liquid refresh-
ment in the genteel atmosphere
of a glorified Ennismore Arms.
This more refined hostelry
rather appealed to last year's
President, Si Lyle, and it was
decided to model the bar
planned for South Side on it.
The general finish of the
South Side block will be rather
on the style of Weeks Hall,
with an over-riding impression
of concrete, glass and varnished
woodwork. It might, perhaps,
be an idea not to have swing
doors made of one piece of plate
glass, judging by the frequ-
ency with which the door at
Weeks has suffered from
people trying to walk through
without even attempting to
open it first.
Down with the old, up with the new.
