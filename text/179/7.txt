Among the new lads to

vehicle to act as '

turned up i n the shape of a fire engine i n Warrington. Further
investigation revealed a 1916 Dennis Fire Appliance with a 9 i l r . ,
four cylinder engine which devoured petrol at the rate of five
miles to the gallon. Negotiations with the owners, Messrs. Cross-
field and Son., resulted i n the presentation of the fire engine to
the U n i o n , (in view of its 'edcuational interest'.

eventful jouney (the big ends
wient) the fire engine finally
arrived in London. As a re-
sult of this acquisition, the
nucleus of the R C S Motor
Club was formed from a few
of the more motor minded
members of the Union. The
main concern of the Motor
Club since then has been the
care and maintenace of the fire
engine, which was christened
'Jezebel', probably on account
of her scarlet attire.
Tom 1955 to 1957, the en-
gine was checked and rewired,
the body repainted and other
beauty treatment given. Since
most of the 'bugs' in the en-
gine were ironed out then, the
maintenance nowadays consists
of minor repairs (no previous
mechanical experience required
—just keenness) and polishing
the brasswork. Fifty five (55)
square feet of brass, however,
mean a lot of polishing, so if
anyone is keen on ' B u l l ' , then
here's your chance.
In the coming session, it is
hoped to arrange works visits
and film shows for the inter-
est of the Bluebell stained
polishers, as well as sporting

there is the veteran car run to
Brighton, and Jez has made a
point of being there as a spec-
tator since 1957; some police
even think that she is a com-
petitor (actually some twelvt.
years too young). I n M a y ,

these formed a usual midfielri

having to endure three 20
minute sessions! They will
surely enjoy the first few
games of 40 minutes each way
even if they do intend leaving
the field at half time to re-
plenish their stamina.
Eight fixtures, and possibly
a ninth, will be arranged for

Soccer Club
T H E Soccer C l u b continues to expand. M o r e Freshers than ever
before turned up i n H y d e Park for the preliminary trials, i n spite
of the Beeching v. N U R matohe also being played o n that day.
After tha ohjaos i n the I C W A changing room the lads soon began
to sort themselves out whereupon the University Soccer C a p a i n
pounced with glee upon four very promising players.
W i t h the first hurdle over,
the second began to loom om-
inously as the committee bat-
tled with the problem of ac-
commoding 140 players on
three pitches during the final
trials. The playing fields at
Eton were never like this . . .
but nevertheless with the ex-
cellent co-operation of all pre-
sent the day was quite a suc-
cess and a rough estimate of
each man's ability (obtained.
At this point I would like to
stress to all Freshmen not to
worry if they are in a lower
team than they expected. On
two appearances an exact as-
sessment is impossible, it is in
the next few weeks that the
proper trials take place.
A definite conclusion to be
drawn from the last week's ex-
periences is that, the Soccer
Club is yet again able to turn
out several very powerful
sieds. On Wed. 19th Oct. nine
teams will take the field and
with the added ability of the
Extra Sevenths (they must
be renamed the Extra Strongs)

expect a very successful sea-

However, we must not rest
upon our laurels and the 1st
and 2nd X I ' s with any other
'volunteers' will be dealt with
by our qualified F . A . coach,
Mr. L . J . Austin on Tuesday
and Thursday lunchtimes.
The 1st X I have already
started off well by beating St.

School 4-3. After being un-
luckily 3 -1 down at half-time
I.C. fought back well to gain
victory by two well-taken
goals and a penalty from our
'kicker', J . B . Preece.
Finally I would like to thann
the committee and all club-
members for their help in get-
ting the season off to a good
start.
Keep it up lads and please
tick off early.

us in our difficult task at the
beginning of the season.
Training—for all would be 1st
and Extra 1st players and any
one else who requires it —will
take place at 5.30 p.m. on
Mondays and 12.30 p.m. on
Thursdays in the gymnasium.
It is hoped that a good turn-
out will be achieved on both
days. Play hard, enjoy your
game, and try and stay an
hour or two after the match
to maintain the social spirit
of vour club.

IC Rover Crew in Spain
On June 24th, twenty two
assorted knees, belonging to
past and present members of
the Imperial College Rover
Crew, met at Victoria Station
and departed for Puigcerda in
the Eastern Pyrenees,. The
journey out was broken in
Paris for one day and one
night, spending tihe night at
the Maison des Jeunes et de
la Culture, the only advantage
of this establishment being
that i t was cheap. After a
full day's sightseeing, the
journey to Spain was com-
pleted, and by devious means
of transport (e.g. buses and
milk lorry owned by a charac-
ter rejoicing i n the name of
'Pedro') the final destination
was reached. This was a small
village called Querforodat, sit-
uated at a height of 4,000 ft.
The following fortnight was
spent 'forest bashing' along
non-existent paths (marked on
the map, but not on the
ground), attempting to walk
along Sierra del Codi, and vis-
iting Andorra, which was full
of tourists. The camp ended
with the traditional dinner,
held at the local "vino bar"
where the wine flowed
freely, and then the par-
ty adjourned to Barcelona,
camping next to a slaughter
house where pigs were killed
at 5 a.m. The following day
was spent sightseeing, swim-
ming in the Mediterranean,
and in the evening we saw a
bull-fight—a rather gory but
very impessive spectacle, then
after a meal of fried squid we
returned to the slaughter-
house camp site and the follow-
ing day returned to London.
No-one got arrested for
knees i n Spain, but one group
did get arrested for crossing the
Spanish-Andorran frontier illic-
itly, but were relleased after
out-drinking the guards.
