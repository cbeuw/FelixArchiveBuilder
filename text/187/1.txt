STORM OVER PRESIDENTS 45 SEC. ADDRESS
The Imperial College Union decided by a majority of 16 votes
to join the National Union of Students forthwith at a debate last
Thursday. Main features of the three-hour meeting were brilliant
speaking by Finch and Stacey, followed by an irregular outburst by
Chandmal who spoke emotionally and out of turn. All present were
surprised when the President leapt to his feet after the debate had
closed and in 45 furious seconds split the solidarity of the executive
with an unconstitutional plea to support the motion.
In a historic secret ballot the tion as " the flat earth brigade,"
he farsightedly explained that
their financial arguments would
be dealt with later.
N.U.S., continued Mr. Finch,
student national body, and it
exists to campaign for student
welfare, to focus student opinion.
Their views are expressed in a
policy statement issued every
year giving the opinions of the
majority. He went on to give
examples of such policies : the
University Central Clearing
House scheme, and automatic
grants for those who have ob-
tained University places. At pre-
sent N.U.S. is seeking abolition of
the means test.
motion was carried by 405 votes
to 389 with 27 abstentions. The
validity of this vote is perhaps
weakened by the fact that many
either did not stay to the end, or
could not get into the hall at all.
But the high total of votes cast
suggests that the unrest of the
previous Weeks has made the
Union acutely aware of the mag-
nitude of the issue.
FINCH PROPOSES
25 MINUTE ORATION
Mr. Finch spoke clearly and
effortlessly for the best part of 25
minutes while elucidating the
two points he had to make. First,
that i.C. ought to be paying to
support a National Body of stu-
dents ; second, that I.C.U. ought
to join N.U.S. for the facilities it
offers. Referring to the Opposi-

A RESPONSIBLE BODY
DISTINGUISHED
VICE-PRESIDENTS
N.U.S., continued Mr. Finch;,
has on its board many distin-
guished names, e.g., Sir John
Wolfenden and Sir Keith Murray
of the University Grants Com-
mittee. He added that all three
political parties and many Na-
tional Committee have conferred
extensively with N.U.S. They
have also submitted many care-
fully prepared memoranda to
to Government bodies ; I.C. he
cWmed, has not and cannot do
this and thus can hardly claim to
be making itself heard. He fur-
ther quoted instances of N.U.S.
bringing pressure to bear on the
Government by the use of repre-
sentatives in the House of Com-
mons.
"Can I.C. do any of this?"
he asked, " when it has neither
staff nor resources ; nor has it
representatives in the Houses of
Parliament ?"
HISTORICAL HANGOVER
Mr. Finch then dealt exten-
sively with the travel concessions
available through the N.U.S.
agencv who arrange many char-
ter flights ; also work camps in
Eurooe. He enumerated the
benefits due to its members : the
DÂ»-ama Festival, the Observer
M
ace debating competition, and
the numerous and useful N.U.S.
publications.

J'ACCUSE
No member of this Union can
feel either pleased or even satis-
fied with the outcome of the
NUS debate last Thursday. The
motion, precarious and inflam-
mable as it was, was carried
through all the legitimate stages
of a proper and formal debate
until at the very last instant the
President, who hitherto had
maintained a studied but deceit-
ful neutrality, took into his mind
to throw into an already close
balance the marginal weight of
his own duplicity.
Marginal indeed it was. Merely
sixteen votes in a total of over
eight hundred are alleged to
clinch the case for the affiliation
of our Union to the National
Union of Students. This too, the
result of a voting system so de-
vised as to permit half the people
to decide after hearing only half
the debate.
At this moment we must accept
the liability of weak and un-
principled direction of this
Union. We have no excuse for
self-retribution. It falls to those
who regard as worthwhile the
proud reputation of this Union
the unhappy task of preserving it
from a man who has shown him-
self anything but trustworthy in
his duty. We are forced to recog-
nise a President whose collusion
with a particular pressure group
has been neither open nor
honourable, and who has at-
temped to perpetrate in the full
view of the Union the exercise of
his own volition in a manner
neither constitutional nor accept-
able.
