/ submit, Sir, that his letter was
nonsensical, and venture to sug-
gest that further incoherence by
the garrulous Welshment be re-
turned to him with your compli-
ments.
I remain, Sir, highly amused.
J. M. COMBES.
Dear Sir,
Is it possible that through the
good offices of your paper, an
article or statement on the rea-
sons for the unforgivable delay on
South S:
de might be printed ? All
that his been received to date is
a brief duplicated note giving
vague promises of accommoda-
tion for a certain few, perhaps at
Easter.
This is a matter that concerns
about a seventh of the student
population, and all the. students
that patronise Mooney's, and yet
all is quiet on the Southern Front.
If it was known at the time when
application forms were being
filled in that 1962-63 was as good
as out as regards South Side
(Summer Term is, apart from the
Carnival, the time for exams and
premature exodus to vac jobs),
one could have planned accord-
ingly.
South Side was due to open last
October—now we shall be lucky
if it opens by April. Why has
there been this delay (typically
British) of some seven months ?
Is it due to prolonged tea breaks,
six-month strikes, or just plain
bungling by the contractors, giv-
ing an attractive completion date
just to clinch the deal ?
Whatever the reason, it has de-
prived some 80 third year stu-
dents of their chance of two years
in hall, and it has deprived 3,000
of the chance of having proper
hot meals.
Or is it all caused by Mr.
Moonev putting a Norwegian
Meat Ball in the works, in the
knowledge that thing'; will be the
same qualitywise at his food halls,
even when South S'de ooens.

WHAT IS THIS O.S.W.
ABOUT
" Yes, I've seen those posters
around the place and now I've
got this leaflet—but I still don't
know what this Overseas Service
Week is all about." This was
said to one of
our leaflet distri-
butors last week.
O.S.W. is a collection of talks,
films and discussions. These are
all meant to arouse some interest
in the opportunities for work in
the developing countries. If you
feel you would like to work
abroad, either for one year as a
volunteer or for several years
under contract, then come to the
O.S.W. Information Centre for
more details. It is open from
12 30 p.m. to 7.0 p.m. every day
this week. We have a marvel-
lous selection of leaflets, etc., to
give you. We may even be able
to answer some of your ques-
tions !
To all good Bilgemen ; we are
celebrating the latest magnificent
achievement of the Spitty and
Bilge College Union, and at the
same time giving, obeisance • to
our great leader, and more espec-
ially to our wise, intelligent, witty,
modest vice-president, who is
writing this article on your be-
half.
In a daringly performed raid
on the Royal College of Organ-
ists, four hundred Bilgemen dis-
guised as organ pipes filtered
steathily into the main hall of the
College. With a great shout of
the College chant "Oomeenakas,"
they overcame the caretaker and
the solitary student of that Col-
lege (a certain Hungarian called
Mitch Rota), and then seized the
mascot of the RCO, " The lesser
Tremulo Windpipe," known in
the trade as a " Magglowen."
Come along to our next Union
Meeting and you will be able to
see this mascot being exhibited
R A M A
together with those of Bally-
bunion Rural Tech and the Royal
School of Minors.
A special attraction will be a
life-size model of the President of
the Royal College of Signs, into
which the Executive can stick
pins while muttering weird incan-
tations.
The superiority of the Sp'tty
and Bilge Union in the sporting
field is demonstrated by the fact
that for the sixth year running,
we have won the Intercollegiate
walking race from " Mooney's "
to the bar. This successful
achievement cannot be explained
away simply by saying that, for
instance. Bilges is much the best
College at running (away ?). We
in Bilges are good, we know we
are good, and we tell everyone
that we are good.
Remember the date of the next
Union Meeting—January 37th, in
the Golders Green Crematorium.
Yours till H-ll freezes.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
