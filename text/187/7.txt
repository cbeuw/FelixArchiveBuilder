Did you have difficulty finding
digs last term ? Did it perhaps
occur to you that I.C. could have
easily compiled a list from the ex-
periences of all those others before
you ? Isn't this something I.C.
Union could do to help towards
another aspect of the welfare of
its members apart from sports
facilities ? Or do you think the
U.L. Bureau is sufficient ? I
wonder.
Are you a P.G. who works
almost alone in the lab., and finds
it difficult to make new friends
easily ? Are you having trouble
with the language ? Have you
found yourself in a small clique
and would like to make some new
friends ?
Are you wondering where to
find the true, purely social, life of
I.C. without having to join an
organised activity ? Can it be at
the Saturday Hop(e)?
I have been told of a conti-
nental University whose Student
Union produces a neatly bound
sheaf of printed notes, based on
lecturer's notes, for every course.
These the students can purchase,
and thus enables them to concen-
trate more on what the lecturer is
saying and therefore understand
it better. There are dangers in
this, of course, but basically it is
a good idea. The University it-
self should do this, but since it
doesn't the students do it them-
selves. Is this too big for I.C.?
There are a great number of
things that could be done to im-
prove this Union considerably
before we can sit smugly back
and say, " We've got the best
Union in the country." Compari-
sons are useless unless you com-
pare what you are, with what you
could be. I intend to experiment
with these and other ideas in
R.C.S. Union to see how much
can be done, and find just how it
could be extended to I.C. Union
itself.
That is why, for me, the ques-
tion of joining or not joining
NUS is rather ridiculous. Charity
begins at home, and we have so
much more to do here. It's rather
like proposing to build a space-
ship when you haven't yet learned
to build a house. Even if we
do get some extra concessions,
why sell your bread and butter to
buy jam to put on it ?
But that's for the Union to de-
cide. As far as I'm concerned
building should take its logical
course and start at the founda-
tions. (Maybe that's what is
wrong with South Side). , And
that means we should start im-
proving this Union, because sure
as hell, nobody else will.

IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF
LOVE . . ,
We're afraid you will have to
make your own arrangements
about the love, but the food and
the music will both be provided
at the C A R N I V A L LUNCHES,
to be held this term. For 2/6 you
are provided with cheese rolls and
the I.C. Jazz Band. (You are
recommended to eat the rolls and
listen to the band rather than
vice-versa). Many of the Col-
lege's Top People will be attend-
ing these lunches ; so if you want
to be seen in the best of circles,
go to the Carnival Lunches!
In connection with these
lunches, we should like someone
to help out as Assistant Carnival
Lunch Organizer. This is an in-
teresting job with many perks
(including of course free cheese
rolls). If you fancy yourself as
a budding Charles Forte, please
let the Carnival Office know.
COMMANDOES
Judging by the response to
appeals for commandoes, there
are large numbers of I.C. men
interested in doing something
different and exciting at Carnival
time. Will all those who have
already volunteered please note
that there will be a Council of
War in Committee Room A next
Tuesday (February 19th) at 1.30
p.m. So please attend, all would-
be commandoes—and leave your
bayonets outside!
STYNX
STYNX is still short of original
stories by I.C. students—STYNX
is YOUR Carnival Magazine, so
hie ye to your garret, men of I.C.,
and write ! Stories are needed
most, but jokes and cartoons
would also be very gratefully re-
ceived by the Editor.
OVERALL TICKETS
One product of the question-
naire—which has provided some
interesting information about
your views on Carnival—was the
suggestion that Carnival Tickets
be sold which admit the holder
to all Carnival Events—Films,
Bat BQ, International Evening,
etc.—at reduced prices. This
will save us work and save you
money, so look out for the tickets
when they come on sale. And to
the person who suggested the
idea—thank you !
QUESTIONNAIRE
While on the subject of the
questionnaire—the response has
been fair, but only fair. There
are still some questionnaires
lying about the place, so—if you
haven't filled one in yet—please
do, and return it to the Carnival
or Union Office. We should also
like to apologise for the fact that
the questionnaires were not in all
cases distributed with Felix.
EXTRA ATTRACTION ! ! !
If the present weather condi-
tions permit—as seems extremely
likely—then a new feature of
Carnival activities will be a
Grand Skiing Competition. The
exact form has yet to be decided
—some prefer a grand slalom
down Hampstead Heath, others
favour a ski run built on to the
Elec. Engl. High Block. We will
keep you posted, but in the mean-
while we suggest you keep your
skiis ready for action.
P.S.—Any volunteers to form
a First Aid Club ?
PRIZES
It has been decided to award a
prize for the best float at the pro-
cession and the best staff. Though
we of course realize that people
will in any case give generously
of their time and effort with no
thought of material reward
(moral blackmail, they call that)
the prizes will, we hope, be a
further spur to the efforts of float
and stall builders. If this kind of
thing interests you (stall building,
that is, not moral blackmail—you
can leave the latter to us !) let the
Carnival office know.

A career
is what it's
If y o u divide the population into two groups —those
who take T H E TIMES and those who d o n ' t — y o u find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are i n the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top i n their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority i n experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do y o u
place yourself?
