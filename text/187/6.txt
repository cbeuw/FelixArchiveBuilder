Apart from the three or four
plays already reviewed, there is
nothing new in the West End,
which can be honestly recom-
mended, so I'm shouting about
something new this Week.
Would you like to hear, in the
coming month, Andor Foldes
playing Bartok, or John Ogden
playing Messiaen ? Would you
like to hear Mozart's Violin Con-
certo in A Major, Bartok's violin
concerto, a " first performance,"
Stravinsky's " Orpheus "? Would
you accept tickets for these and
similar concerts for one year ab-
solutely free ?
The performances are given in
a warm comfortable hall, a nine-
penny bus ride from Oxford Cir-
cus and are designed to satisfy
and excite the most jaded music
lover. There are two concerts
a week, on Saturdays and Thurs-
days, and apart from being musi-
cally of the highest standard,
they are a useful jumping off
point for those whose musical
awareness somehow gets stuck at
about 1900 (discounting the jazzy
bits in Stravinsky and the gooey
bits in Rachmaninoff.) This is
a vital hurdle to jump—to catch
up with those when who are
thinking, feeling, suffering in the
same climate as ourselves, with-
out comfortable romantic certain-
ties or, apparently, agreed prin-
ciples of any sort.
The content of a typical con-
cert would be Hindemith-Bach-
Bartok, with frequent excursions
to the extreme avant garde on the
one hand, and on the other, the
cool, refreshing motifs of the
seventeenth century. A quarterly
review of all these concerts is
available free and on receiving
this, one can send off for all the
complementary tickets required
for that quarter.
So if the processed musical
diet of gramophone, radio, and
T V is slowly transforming you
into a pop culture moron, whv
not write off to rich Auntie BBC
and ask to be invited to some of
her concerts (on the Third, of
course).

In our last issue, there was an
announcement that Auntie Lope
was opening up a Readers' Ad-
vice Column, and for lack of
space, we reprint a selection only
of the letters received, with
Auntie's advice.
Dear A.L.,
My mother let me read the re-
cent report in Sennet. I am
neither married or living together.
Can I be catered for by an I.C.
Society ?
—" Urgent " (Physics I).
Dear Urgent,
Having read this report with
Mary, we were also worried by
the fact that none of our friends
were living together either. The
conclusion that we came to was
that we were normal, unlike the
cases treated in Sennet. I am
sure that IC can fit you in some-
where.
Dear A.L.,
What is your opinion of a
friend of mine who regularly
takes, girls out, and is friendly to-
wards them. He is not frus-
trated, or unhappy, and treats
them in a gentlemanly fashion.
" Worried."
Dear Worried,
Be it far from my mind to de-
cry his activities, but he is still
obviously a bachelor. After six
months of wedlock, I am sure
that he will see reason and lose
his present habits. This will be
a GOOD THING (1066 and all
that jazz).
Dear A.L.,
I am in my sixth year at IC and
have still not been out with a
young lady. Is there anyone that
you could recomment ?
PG 3.
Dear Allison,
The only young lady we can
suggest who is definitely not
young is the Sportswoman of the
year.
Dear, A.L.,
I am going to have a baby just
before the exams. What should
I dot
" Virginia " (NUS).
Dear Madam,
The question is verging on the
ridiculous, but I should answer
all the questions in section I.
Dear A.L.,
I have a problem in that I am a
fresher and seventeen. Nobody
has invited me to any of the IC
functions. I am seriously con-
templating suicide. What should
I dol
" Flossie " (ICWA).
Dear Flossie,
I am sure that if you contem-
plate regularly, someone will in-
vite you to a function.
Auntie Lope is willing to an-
swer serious questions of a con-
troversial nature. Replies will of
cdurse be biased, but plain enve-
lopes and free booklets are OUT.

I remember once hearing a member of this College remark :
" The three most important things in life are beer, sport" and women
—in that order." This remark seems to exemplify much of the
actions, although not necessarily the true feelings, of many members
of this College. Are these really the three pillars of wisdom upon
which this union stand
There also springs to mind the comment that appeared in a
recent "Felix," after remarking that C.E.M. had knocked us out
of the Cup in both Rugby and Hockey—" They must be a big
College. Naturally they must be—if they can beat us !"
For the people who actively participate in the Union there is a
considerable amount of enjoyment to be obtained. But to the rest
who don't—i.e., the majority—this Union probably doesn't seem all
that is is cracked up to be.
" But" what more can we do ? We provide all the facilities we
could, don't we ? Far more than most other Colleges do. After all
these people just aren't interested."
Not interested in what ? The providing extensive sports and re
things those who run the Union
say they should be interested in ?
It is a difficult situation for a
college expanding as rapidly as
this one, with such a large P.G.
to undergraduate ratio, and so
many overseas students. But does
V O L U N T A R Y SERVICE A T
H O M E
You are all no doubt aware
this is Overseas Service Week : a
week during which I.C. students
are being encouraged to go
abroad, after graduating, and ex-
tend a technically helping hand to
their fellow World Citizens of the
developing countries. While hop-
ing that this campaign has all the
success that it deserves one
realises that there must be many
among us who, though keen to
engage in voluntary service, find
it impossible, for one reason or
another, to go abroad.
The Commonwealth Service
Group was set up specially to
tap this enthusiasm. It is a group
of young people in the 18-plus
age range who* offer their services
to promote racial integration in
this country. This work takes
place of necessity mainly among
immigrants. The group tries to
achieve its ends by three main
methods. (1) Learning more
about Commonwealth countries
from lectures and films at
monthly meetings. (2) Working
for immierants. (3) Attracting
Commonwealth young people
into the Group and so working
with, as well as for, overseas
members of the Commonwealth.
(This last method has been singu-
larly unsuccessfi * in that the vast
majority of mer bers are natives
of this country.) Membership of
this Group requ 'es no practical
qualifications, c ly a desire to
help with the v rk projects or-
ganised during ; ime weekends :
and members m r give as much
or as little of th r spare time as
thev choose. T, i only demand
on the pocket is ; subscription of
5/- a year.
If you would lil t to know more
about this Grout please contact
me via the Mat is. letter rack
(Huxlev Building) I would like
to mention, to avoid misunder-
standina, that this group is not an
I.C. societv.

creational facilities and then say-
ing, " There you are, now get on
with i t " define a Union ? Is it
enough ? After all, what is a
Union ? It's not the building, or
a set of rules or even the small
group of people who profess to
run it. It's all the people who
make up that Union. Every
single student who is a member is
an integral part, and without his
participation in some way, no
matter how small, both he and
the Union lose something. The
greatest thing about a Student
Union is the opportunity to meet
others of widely differing races
and beliefs, whether through
playing in a soccer team, or just
chatting over coffee. I feel sure
that a lot more emphasis could
be put on non-sporting activities
at this college than is at present,
and try to give more of a Univer-
sity atmosphere. I remember
feeling this atmosphere1
only once.
And that was at a Southampton
University carnival rag. We went
down there to avenge the steal-
ing of one of our mobile mascots,
and finally ended up fraternising
with the " enemy," and I remem-
ber quite enjoying their Carnival
Ball, but not the hitch-hiking
home at 4.0 the next morning.
That was in my first year, and
ever since I have been longing to
see a more personal atmosphere
introduced here too.
One of the main complaints of
those who try to run a Union is
the amount of apathy one finds.
But how do you define apathy ?
If a fellow happens to be more
interested in something other than
what you are trying to arrange
for him, do you blame him for
hot bothering ? Would it not be
a good idea to find out what
these outside interests are, and
why he prefers them to college
affairs. Could it be we have not
provided all the facilities we
could ?
Did you, for example, enjoy
last Christmas ? Did you once
again bring up enough of your
over-eating to feed a dozen
people ? Or were you one of the
less fortunate ones whose home is
overseas, or who has no real
home to go to ? Did you wonder
as you celebrated alone, just what
the Union is doing for you ?
