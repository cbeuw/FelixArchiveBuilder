Editorial Comment
Well, well, well, how about that ? The Thesaurus has probably
got a whole collection of suitable phrases for the occasion—Trojan
horse, secret weapon, bolt out of the blue, or just pure and simple,
a big shock for the Union. The issue ? NUS, of course. The
unexpected oration by President Chandmal at a crucial moment in
the debate has led to doubts about the validity of what can only be
described as a marginal majority, and has undoubtedly led to a
serious loss of confidence in the man himself.
If, as seems likely, the President's intention was to clinch the
issue, he certainly failed. The issue is certainly not a dead letter,
which in a way is a pity. Lively interest created in the Union is all
very well, but not when it can lead to public airing of dirty linen.
ON THE SIGHT
COLCUTT
What a Union Meeting! So
we are in N.U.S. Or are we?
Many people think Mr. Chand-
mai has gone too far this time.
Well it was a bit unconstitutional
speaking after the final summing-
up. Did I say unconstitutional ?
Let's face it, I.C. has not got a
constitution, just a set of bye-
laws, which are O.K. so long as
we have a President that we can
trust. The Union Meeting was a
disgrace—a mockery of demo-
cracy.
I wish to apologise to my
readers for misleading them. I
was sold up the river by this
"politician" too. In the 180
issue I said " perhaps he will turn
out to be one of the best Presi-
dents this college has had," in the
182 issue I said, " Colcutt, like
Asit Chandmal is neutral." I
have shown to be wrong. Let's
hope that Mr. Chandmal realises
that he was wrong before it is too
late. Somehow I think it is too
late.
I see my friend Mr. Harris has
at last revealed the ramifications
of his troubled mind. He makes
a lot of good points in an article
written in his own inimitably
hilarious style. A scientific train-
ing certainly makes you think
straight—what a pity we haven't
enough men like him to devote
time to his schemes. " Dan the
Bomb " tried to organise foreign
students at the expense of his
academic work. Who is going
to run our lodgings bureau and
non-organised social activities for
anti-social Union members who
do not wish to join organised
clubs. Anyone spending too
much time running' the Union
will not get a degree. Still, never
mind, NUS will run the Union for
us. Trouble is, we still need six
people with enough spare time to
be a delegate to the NUS con-
ferences, and still satisfy their
tutors and examiners. The only
solution would be to become a
Technical College and make
Chandmal President.
Dear Sir,
As a rational member of this
Union, I should like, through
your columns, to express my sur-
prise and disgust at the handling
of the NUS debate by Union Presi-
dent Chandmal. Entering the
Union Meeting undecided, I was
surprised that it was not until
2.25 that a speaker against the
motion was given the floor, the
chairman allowing a speaker
"for" to have his say although
he had clearly called for a
speaker against. I presumed that
the President had done this due to
inexperience, but was able to
make my mind up after the sum-
ming up speeches.
Imagine my horror and disgust
when after the " final " summing-
up speeches, the President, with-
out de-robing, and without regard
to his office as chairman, with its
implied neutrality, spoke his un-
expected piece, just as people
were marking their ballot papers.
No opportunity was given to
the opposers to reply to this last
outburst.
It seems to me that in view of
the deplorable action of the Presi-
dent and the very small majority
(16 in a count of over 800) the
result must be considered invalid.
I therefore call upon the Presi-
dent to have the issue debated at
a further Union Meeting : if he
feels so strongly about the matter
he is perfectly entitled to hand
over the chair to some neutral
person, and say his piece at the
proper time. We can then dec'de
one way or another wtihout any
recourse to what can only be de-
scribed as shoddy tactics.

TEN YEARS OF THE

It was intended, in this issue, to
present an account of the Rector's
address dealing with the expan-
sion of the Cellege. Due to the
space consuming propensities of
the NUS issue, this has been held
over and will appear later in the
the term.

My Dear Sir,
When in a recent Felix we were
urged to wear our gowns, I was
sure that my voice amidst the
general clamour of applause
would be superfluous. > It seems
things are not so, therefore I haste
now tardily to commend the sense
of dignity and tenaceous moral
fibre of your—alas nameless—
correspondent. I wish he would
defy that notorious injustice to
Undergraduate London, the ban
on public Rags.
May I suggest that we should
have an Imperial Gown Wearer's
Association, pledged to the Wear-
ing of Academic Dress ? One
can envisage many exciting func-
tions which such a body might
organise, such as visits to Cam-
bridge where the Shorter or Baby
Doll gown may be seen, and of
course to ceremonies of presenta-
tion of degrees ; members would
thus get opportunities of finding
out improvements to their existing
gowns by the addition of gaily
coloured ribbons, hoods and fur
trimmings, these last especially in
view of our recent inclement
weather. I am sure many stu-
dents would derive much enjoy-
ment from such activities, and if
needlework proved an obstacle to
some, those of the Fair Sex would
no doubt be ready with their help-
ful thimbles. Thus all can share
in the fun together.
Should this happy thought of
m'ne strike an answering tasseled
cord in hearts that beat high to
the Imperial Ideal, then indeed I
have no* failed to be undecived in
mistrusting the good sense of my
colleagues.
Yours sincerely,
CHRISTOPHER MAY.

Dear Sir,
Mr. Phillip's letter in your last
issue opens new fields in the realm
of the descriptive adjective ; there
are many more that it would now
be possible to apply without fear
of misrepresentation. At any
rate, the ones I used previously
must undoubtedly have been cor-
rect.
But what was the point of his
outburst: Was it to complain at
my accuracy (my name, Mr.
Phillips, is spelt COMBES), or
was it to give himself further
publicity (hardly; he assures me
that he is both sincere and self-
effacing). It may have been to
give me publicity (perhaps, if so
I am grateful), or to criticise the
incompleteness of my article ;
(some of my choicest remarks
were unfortunately omitted by the
Editor). It may merely have been
an objection to my expressing an
opinion in a report on the sacred
cow of Imperial College.
