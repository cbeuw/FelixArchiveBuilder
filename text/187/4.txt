A F E L I X
Union
Meeting
(Continued)
Finally, dealing with finance,
he told of a projected students
centre with auditoria and many
facilities for which they have a
reserve fund of £105,000.
" I.C. is suffering from a his-
torical hangover carried by the
flat earth brigade, many of whom
are no longer students."
This had been a long introduc-
tion, but one which remained
with the audience right to the
end. Superbly persuasive, he
kept to the point continually, de-
spite repeated heckling.
CARTER IN GOOD FORM
SHORT SPEECH CONTRAST
Disdainfully ignoring the
microphones, and shouting as if
the Queens had only just closed,
Mr. Carter followed in contrast-
ing style. Heckled repeatedly by
a bearded colleague, the speaker
used it to good effect and soon
won his audience—to himself if
not to his sentiments. " There is
no such thing as a Universal
students view point," he cried,
"far better that the College
Carter Speaking
should express its own opinion
out of the swamp that is N.U.S."
As far as facilities were con-
cerned, he had obtained from
every N.U.S. listed firm exactly
the same concession offers for I.C.
To this there were two excep-
tions : " a grotty little postcard
from Foyle's," and a letter of
mammoth proportions containing
only two recognizable sentences
from the lesser known source. He
continued by saying that I.C. is
the strongest Union in the country
because they did things for them-
selves ; and with a final cry he
claimed that we have not enough
personnel to run our own Union,
let alone that of N.U.S.
PEARSON ON FINANCE
" OF NO SIGNIFICANCE "
Opening with his customary
" M r . President, Sir," Mr. Pear-
son gave a detailed and deliberate
resume of the financial situation
in this Union. Not wishing to cut
his own neck he did not suggest
that the required £300 be raised
from the Club Grants. His point
was that since the Union is paying
out large sums for such things as
gliders, boats, and sports centres,
it could easily afford the extra
sum for N.U.S. membership. His
manner rather than his text was
convincing, and he closed on the
note that the financial aspect was
not of great relevance; the issue
should be judged on the points
made by the proposer.
MEETING BECOMES
CHAOTIC
C H A I R M A N LOSES GRIP
At this point the debate
lowered its tone considerably and
became unfortunately reminiscent
of one of the more sporting of
College occasions. Heckling,
shouting, and laughing assumed
gigantic proportions and the
speakers were given no chance.
In part the speakers themselves
were responsible for failing to
control themselves and their audi-
ence : but on these occasions >i
MEN WHO CAN
T A CHALLENGE
haVe'*aih exciting future
with
T h e ever-increasing demand for
power constitutes a major challenge
to the Central Electricity Generating
Board and to the men and women
who work within it. T o engineers
and scientists, a career with the
Board offers an exciting and re-
warding future in an industry which
must double its output every ten
years.
T h e variety of opportunity within the
Board is wide. For mechanical and
electrical engineers, the 1
Board
offers s o m e of the finest industrial
training in the U.K. A two-year
training is given: planned practical
training may also be given to those
who join research. Scientists, as
well as engineers, are needed for
Research and Development.
For those who hanker for adventure,
the Board offers the certainty of
rapid technical advance. Nuclear
power, c r o s s - channel cables,
p u m p e d storage . . . and what next?

is the duty of the chairman to
restore order. This he entirely
failed to do.
Mr. Johnson endeavoured to
make a point but was caught up
in the general confusion and
eventually sat down unsatisfied.
This he took in good part, but the
next speaker Mr. Phillips was un-
able to do any better against re-
peated rowdy outbursts. Unfor-
tunately, he lost control of him-
self as well as his oration and the
point he tried to make was not
very clear; eventually he de-
scended to the level of his audi-
ence. At this point Mr. Berry
rightly pleaded that the Chairman
exert his authority and call order.

PEACE RETURNS
LIDDLE A T HIS BEST
After an inconsequential
speech by Mr. Finney proposing
that the President's Ball be used
to finance N.U.S., Mr. Liddle
shed his Presidential cloak and
took the stand. This was a
fluent and convincing Liddle, an
informed and well delivered
speech." It was the first time that
the opposition had presented a
balanced and prepared point of
view, and how welcome it was
after the previous incoherence.
" We are an expanding College
and we can barely afford the
price of expansion," this was his
theme. The £8,000 in the reserve
would just about cover the cost
of renewing the Union furniture ;
then there is the sports centre
which will need equipping, also
extensions at Harlington. The
Presidents Ball entertains not
only the Administration, but also
those who have served the Union
throughout the year; as such it
is a good and necessary thing.
As a parting remark he made a
point later stressed by Mr. Old-
field : the Royal Dental College
left N.U.S. two years ago be-
cause they did not consider they
were getting true value for
money.
BERRY PERSUASIVE
OLDFIELD BENIGN
Mr. Berry, late of Bristol Uni-
versity, followed Mr. Liddle on
to the floor. This was a bril-
liantly persuasive speech; by
subtle flattery of the Union, the
executive, and the opposition, he
wooed the audience into a half-
