IC AND THE WEATHER
By the Sports Editor
Despite the effects of the weather on their activities, the " big
three" sports clubs are holding regular training sessions in an
endeavour to maintain all-round physical fitness.
The first X I who have yet to play their second round Challenge
Cup match against Goldsmiths, have a varied programme which
includes swimming, circuit training, and cross-country running. The
Hockey Club admit to playing the occasional game of basketball
while the Rugby Club are making
every effort to ensure success in
the UL Sevens Tournament, be-
ginning on March 2nd.
As far as women are concerned
a reliable ICWSC source inter-
viewed recently disclosed that
" we are confining ourselves to in-
door activities." The details of
the training programme have not
been released.
The other Clubs report steady
attendances, the Swimming Club
being the most active. With three
teams entered in the U L Water
Polo League, there are games
every Friday, and the first team
players are averaging two games
a week. The hardiest sportsmen
in the College appear to be the
members of the Boat Club—
Wednesday and Saturday outings
have continued unbroken by the
Arctic conditions, the Thames re-
fusing to freeze over at Putney.
Future prospects ? Harlington
is still covered with a layer of ice
and snow, and there is little like-
lihood of matches being played
there until at least a week after
the thaw sets in for good.
Meantime, anyone for chess ?
FOR SPORT UNAFFECTED
BY THE W E A T H E R -
TAKE UP SQUASH
The Captain of Squash is feel-
ing smug. There can be few
other sports clubs which can
claim to have achieved " busi-
ness as usual" throughout the
cold spell.
The largest event this term was
our week end at Oxford on 26th-
27th January. Despite the
gloomy weather forecasts from
the AA, our fleet of five cars, con-
taining three teams arrived with-
out mishap.
On Saturday afternoon, our
pride was shattered. Not only
did all the teams lose, but the first
V, with a previous record of 15
wins out of 16 games, was routed
5—0 by St. Edmund's Hall. This
College we had defeated
by the same margin last term.
Perhaps there were extenuating
circumstances —• notably a thin
layer of ice over the playing
walls, making the ballistics of the
ball quite unpredictable. Never-
theless, the same difficulties
faced our opponents, and we were
fairly defeated.
The 2nd team were playing
another College, Queens, using
the next door court. They en-
countered similar icy conditions
but acquitted themselves better,
just losing by three marches to
two. The girls' team played Ox-
ford Univ. losing 5^0. They
then returned to London alone.
YHA GROUP
which seemed an unwise move
without the care and protection
of the men's teams. ,
The evening was spent in a
variety of fashions. No detailed
statistics are available, but the
Captain can confidently report
that no one spent it preparing for
the next days' matches. In the
theatre, I had a brief moment of
embarrassament when I was
found in the corner of the bar,
not only drinking a glass of Alka
Seltzer, but offering some to the
barmaid as well. However, I got
my own back when I caught Dick
Gibbons snoring his way through
the second act. Peace finally de-
scended on Oxford in the small
hours when Adrian Erskine
stopped throwing snowballs
through the window to attract
his landlady's attention.
Sunday morning saw the first
team scoring the first victory of
the weekend, defeating Worces-
ter College 4—I. After lunch
both teams played a final match,
the first V defeating Magdaleen
5—0, the second losing to Keble
3—2. After that, we split up
seven staid and sober PCs re-
turned to London, while the three
undergraduates stayed on for a
final cocktail party.
This rather brings me to a final
point, link>ed with the title of this
article. Where are our up and
coming undergraduate squash
players ? Of the twelve players
who have played for the first
team this session, only one is an
undergraduate. Unless some of
you take the game up quickly, we
shall run out of players in a year
or so.

RUGBY FIVES CLUB
Fortunes have been mixed so
far this season. Of the first team
fixtures, the match against a very
strong St. Thomas's Hospital
team (which included three UL
players) resulted in a draw. The
game against UL 2nd team was
won quite comfortably, but a
team weakened by reserves suf-
fered defeat at the hands of the
Jesters Club. We were also
beaten by Glove Club. .
Fixtures in the near future in-
clude St. John's, Cambridge,
Bank of England, and a return
fixture with St. Thomas' Hospital.
As soon as the courts are de-
snowed, it is hoped to renew the
Wednesday afternoon practise
games^anyone wishing to play is
welcome to come along. We con
tinue to pray for covered courts.

A GOOD WEEK-END IN
YORKSHIRE
Late on Friday, 1st February,
a coachload of Y H A members
from IC, QEC and Bedford Col-
lege set off for Malham, in the
West Riding, near Skipton. The
snowy weather, which promised
good walking, did not however
lend itself to driving 200 miles.
The coach skidded first in the
Edgware Road, but neither this
nor the frequent snow showers on
an icy road prevented our driving
up the A l at high speeds. We
reached Malham Youth Hostel
with time in hand, after passing
Skipton where some of us
straightened out an articulated
lorry that was blocking the road.
Saturday and Sunday were days
of beautiful sunshine, that left
everyone two shades browner,
and this, coupled with the few
inches of snow, was probably the
best weather enjoyed on a winter
weekend for some years.
On Saturday, most of the party
visited Malham Cave, the geolo-
gists' paradise, and nearby Mal-
ham Tarn, which appeared
merely as a large flat area. We
returned to Malham for lunch
(two pubs) and in the afternoon
visited Gardale Scar, where 200
foot limestone cliffs overhang the
stream, before spending the night
in the very comfortable hostel.
On Sunday, a longer walk
across the moors in search of a
small and more elusive cave was
enjoyed by all, returning to Mal-
ham for tea, then boarding the
coach for the return journey. The
roads were much better coming
back, and after an uneventful
journey, we returned to the Union
and sought our respective beds.
