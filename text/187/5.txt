belief that all would be well in
NUS. He started by saying that
a Union should provide a service
to its members ; this the ICU did
very well, but Is. 3d. seemed a
small price to pay to extend these
services very considerably. He
went on to show some of the
workings of NUS and proved in-
conclusively that IC could not be
swamped or dominated.
Another excellent speech came
from Mr. Oldfield, leaning be-
nignly on the lecturn, and ques-
tioning the power of NUS in both
Union and individual cases. Re-
cently Battersea College Union
closed and NUS could at best
maintain a meaningless " watch-
ing brief." Strangely this point
was never answered by the oppo-
sition.
MEETING SLOWS DOWN
M A N Y L E A V E
By this stage in the debate
people were getting restless. It
was almost three o'clock, and the
flow of speakers showed no sign
of abating. CMany had left for
lectures, and more continued to
stream out. A promise by the
Chairman to limit the speeches
temporarily halted the exodus.
Mr. Turner gave a good personal
speech defending the principle of
Unions and saying that most
would be prepared to pay to go
to the Presidents Ball. He ended
on the phrase, " the case for NUS
is completely and utterly unan-
swerable." Strong stuff, but for
a debater, a rather confined out-
look.
Mr. Preece, the Secretary of the
Union, followed with the rather
vague idea that more work would
not be a good thing ; he said he
was speaking for himself, how-
ever, and not for the executive
in general.
SUMMING UP
STAGEY U N B E A T A B L E
Mr. Stacey gave one of the
most polished and convincing
speeches heard in the Union for
a long time. A pity there was
not a greater number present to
witness it; certainly it was the
best of the day. He was per-
turbed, first by the emphasis on
moral obligation by the proposer,
and secondly by the timing of the
motion. This, he pointed out,
was the most famous cause
celebre of Mr. Finch's ; why had
the voice of conscience allowed
him to rest so long and so well
(three years).
C H U R C H I L L QUOTED
In support of his above men-
tioned remarks Mr. Stacey quoted
" It is a fine thing to be honest,
but it is also important to be
right." And on concessions he
added that these can be obtained
by anyone; " Philanthropy is a
rare thing in commerce." Mr.
Stacey could not accept that NUS
was solely responsible for all the
things for which they campaign,
and further suggested that the
NUS administration was not as
efficient as it might be. Mr.
Berry's indignant " a most indeli-
cate suggestion" was shouted
down and the ex-secretary of the
union continued. After praising
IC and emphasising the responsi-
bilities of its members to their
predecessors, he defended the
purchase of gliders and boats (not
even NUS can get them cut
price). He ended with the senti-
ment that the motion was ill-
timed since money is: short with
the present programme of expan-
sion : " We are faced with a
stranglehold, the motion is ill-
judged." This was superb ora-
tory and for the first time the
opposition began to look confi-
dent.
After this Mr. Finch completed
his summing up, but his speech
appeared listless and uninspired
after that of his' predecessor.
CHANDMAL SPEAKS
ILL TIMED M O V E
It was at this moment that the
President, apparently incensed by
what had gone before, asked if he
might state his views. The debate
was closed and the summing up
complete. While still in the chair
he stated : (1) that the extra work
involved was negligible.; (2) that
the financial problem was incon-
sequential, and (3) that "IC could
not remain a princely cloister in
Prince Consort Road, but must
have a window on the open world
by joining NUS."
In his defence it is true that the
audience did not object when
asked, and true also that he was
refuting misleading information ;
but his method was dubious.
B A D PRESENTATION BY
OPPOSITION
" A L L M A D "
It is a pity that the opposition
did not plan their attack in more
orderly fashion ; they drove away
the votes when they most needed
them, and were at their brilliant
best at the least effective time.
A final comment on the after-
noon was passed by some of the
participants:
" Fair debate" said Finch,
while Mr. Oldfield took a
different view, " I am not satisfied
that Mr. Chandmal had the right
to influence the voting in the
underhand manner in which he
did." Mr. Phillips took the atti-
tude " Debaters twisted my
words," and from the President
himself:
" We are all mad."
PRESIDENT REPLIES
TO CRITICISM
First a factual correction : the proposer of the NUS motion
finished speaking at 1.55 p.m. Then I said, " It is customary for the
seconder of the motion to speak immediately after the proposer, but
since the proposer, Mr. Finch, has spoken for 25 minutes, I feel we
should have a speech against the motion."—Time 1.56 (not 2.25). At
2.25 Mr. Phillips was speaking the second speech against the motion.
Immediately after Mr. Pearson had finished seconding the
motion, I asked for a speech against. When the gentleman who
came on to the platform actually spoke in favour of the motion, I
was as astonished as everyone else.
It is interesting to note Mr. Stacey's comment. I wonder whether
he felt the same way last year, when President Si Lyle (under whom
Mr. Stacey was Secretary) did exactly the same thing, viz., indicated
which side of the motion he was just before he called for the vote.
1 presume he did, for Mr. Stacey is an honourable man.
My justification for my action is twofold :
1. PRECEDENT
The President of ICU is not the chairman of a debating society ;
very often he gives his views for or against the motion just before
the vote is taken. This was done last year, and several years ago,
and again, by me this year.
2 .ASSENT
In spite of precedent, I clearly asked the consent of the Union
Meeting in the following words: " Several people have asked me to
commit myself on the NUS issue. Is it your wish that I give my
opinion on the NUS issue in less than 45 seconds ?"
Several people shouted " Ye," and no one objected. I there-
fore felt that I had the unanimous consent of the Union Meeting,
tacit or vocal. (It is significant also that there were no objections
forthcoming when I had finished speaking.)
On the basis of these two—precedent, and common consent, I
feel that my actions were fully justified.
