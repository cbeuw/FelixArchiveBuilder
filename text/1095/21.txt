Thought for the day
by Our Kid
No. 2: Christopher Columbus.
Christopher Columbus. Many
people would agree that this man
was one of the bravest and most
important explorers of all time.
Here was a mortal who braved the
immortal seven seas of the Earth.
Despite theories that others
reached America first, most notably
Alexander the Great, it was a cer-
tain Mr. C who blindly set forth on
his famous and daring voyage to
the Americas and discovered a
great wealth of hitherto alien tro-
phies. Some of these were mere
baubles and of no great use; how-
ever some were of supreme bene-
fit to our uninitiated nation. He
gave us coffee; provided us with
shoes. Tobacco and india-rubber;
both were Columbus' contributions
of competence.
Well, cheers, Chris. Goodyear
and Malboro may be in your debt,
but frankly we would have been
better off without the cases of lung
cancer and heart disease for which
your pesky product is responsible.
The nation's breath is well and truly
hanging on the next fascinating
installment of the dire Gold Blend
advertisements. Which brings me
on to another point; we are also
heartily appreciative of all that nice
USA culture you brought with you.
The influx of American trash in all
its forms is something that us
Britons have positively relished
over the years. The fantastic output
of Hollywood is, 1 am sure you
would all agree, a veritable Goliath
to Shakespeare's David. Yes, every-
body knows that Columbus discov-
ered America. Considerably fewer
people realise that when he set off,
Asia was his intended destination.
Ladies and gentlemen, 1 give
you Christopher Columbus. What a
complete pillock.
