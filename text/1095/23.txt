HOLLOWAY I v ICFC I KING'S IV v ICFC IV IC V v KING'S V
We don't like Holloway and they
don't like us. That's why these
games always always are a bit spe-
cial, and the season's first
encounter between the two arch-
rivals had it all: a hat-trick from
Jamie Foulstone, a broken leg and
a goal from captain Psycho.
With Jamie back in the side
Imperial were in control from the
start. Alex Marcos gave IC the lead
with his first of the season, and
even though Royal Holloway
equalised after poor goalkeeping
by Donal Keane, 4 further goals
from Jamie (2), Alex (again) and
Norwegian sensation Germund
Knutsen meant that the hosts were
5-1 down at half-time. To make
matters worse they were actually a
player down as well as one of their
midfielders were carried off with a
broken leg after one of Psycho's
customary challenges.
In the 2nd half Foulstone com-
pleted his hat-trick while new boy
Mikael Askerdal scored with a fine
header. Holloway pulled one back
form the penalty spot before Psycho
got Imperial's 8th goal with a superb
free-kick from 30 yards. Undoubtedly
the worst free kick ever.
The pride of Imperial has been
restored. The beer can once again
flow freely down the Bar. In the
words of former Club Vice-Captain
Phillip Siverns: "The Duke of
Prague has been awakened".
Holloway 1 2 - 8 ICFC I
The famous Imperial Fourths
secured their first point of the sea-
son on Saturday with a hard fought
draw against the team ftom
Canterbury, Wye.
The game itself produced a
battling performance from 1C, so
typical of the Fourth's style of play,
and to be truthful is where our
strength lies. It was goal-less at
half-time with only a couple of
chances for either team, but almost
from the restart a through-ball cut
IC's defence and the Wye striker
rounded the IC 'keeper. Thankfully
we didn't lie down and capitulate
but rolled our sleeves even further
up our arms and managed to dom-
inate the majority of the rest of the
game. The deserved equaliser
came from a well-worked move:
birthday-boy Paul found Ryan on
the right who swept in a low cross
and Richard, beating the defender
to the ball, volleyed into the bot-
tom corner from twelve yards. We
had a couple of chances to win the
game but unfortunately none were
taken. Credit must be given to the
IC 'keeper who crucially saved a
one-on-one in the second-half
Man of the match must have
been David Wishart who dominat-
ed the midfield. Captain Swift and
Paul also played very well both dis-
tributing the ball from the back
with the utmost composure .
Without doubt we will do well
both in BUSA and the league.

There was bright sunshine and
crisp autumn air for this year's first
running meeet. Unfortunately the
course was not as pleasant, as a
large Imperial contingent travelled
to the severely testing hills of
Hampstead Heath.
After finishing runners up to
Brunei in the London colleges
league, IC men were hoping to
wrestle the title off them this time
around. But they finished second
best again. A great deal of potential
was shown, though, and with five
top-ten finishes there is real
strength in depth.
Ben and Captain Chris Fishlock
were as dependabvle as ever, fin-
ishing sixth and ninth respectively.
Demetrius, captain of ULU, came a
respectable nineteenth. Arguably
the biggest bonus of the day was
the discoverey of two possible ath-
letics stars in PGs Gary Mcghee
and Neil Mclntyre, who were both
placed in the mid-teens.
The women's team continue to
dominate with a comfortable win.
There was no surprise to see jenny
Cox record yet another majestic
victory, to go with two other top-
ten finishes from the girls. Captain
Bethan Hopewell is set to return
from injury at the next race, so they
ca only get stronger.
Anyone is welcome to attend
races or train on a Wednesday
afternoon. So keep watching the
noticeboard.

Our first match of the season was
against King's scrubbers. Not only
were we insulted by having to play
in a field but we also had to change
in a porta-cabin.
We started the match very
well, completely outplaying Kings.
We had two shots cleared off the
line and then tragedy struck with
confusion at the back and Kings
beat our keeper Jimmy.
The second half began much
better with an early goal - Ole
crossed the ball in from the right
and Villeneuve put the ball in the
net. We kept showing the more
fluid play but somehow Kings broke
through. Mark put in a firm tackle
on their defender who kicked bla-
tantly and BO, our substitute who
was reffing, awarded the opposi-
tion a penalty. Kings scored and
went on to win the match. BO,
needless to say, is dropped.
ICFC VI -2 King's V
ICFC II v KING'S II
A brilliant first half, a crap second. The
opening goal was a 50 yard screamer
from Si, Warren ate Dorothy (he's got
red boots, think about it kids) scored a
carbon - copy of Saturday's gorgeous-
ness and then bagged a second. From
outside the box Hajo "Double" Dekker
placed it in the top comer to finish them
off. Good performances from Dan,
Martin, Loz, Steve, Jessie, Patrik, Felix,
Andy and Chris in goal. Promotion
looming? Oh yes indeedy.

ICWBC v HOLLOWAY
First match of the season for the
ladies basketball team and the
strength of the opposition, as well
as the lack of preparation of the
team costed the first defeat. With
only one practice last week, and
without a tall player to ensure
some easy rebounds, the ICU team
fought well to the end before suc-
cumbing to the multiple offensive
solutions of RHUL. However, the
result could have been different
without extra effort if the ICU team
had a decent percentage in free
shots, as only 5 of the 24 they took
went in! Patricia Dominguez and
Patrycja Stasina carried the main
burden of the attack and the
defense with loanna Spyropoulou
and Claire Delsol having occasional
bright spells in their performance.
There is a long way to the
championship and much of the
qualification to the final 32 of
BUSA will be judged at the decisive
home match against Q M W in two
weeks' time. A victory there might
even secure a first posiion for the
girls in the ULU group of the BUSA
League. And for this match the
team will be much better pre-
pared.
