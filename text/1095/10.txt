Merger Splurger
A guide to the new IC School of Medicine
The last piece of the jigsaw was
finally in place with the merger of
Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical School (CXWMS) and the
Royal Postgraduate Medical School
(RPMS) with Imperial College
School of Medicine (ICSM) on the
Ist August this year. An annual
intake of 300 makes it not only the
largest medical school in this coun-
try, but also in Europe.
ICSM is mainly based over five
different sites. The Sir Alexander
Fleming Building in South
Kensington, hitherto known as the
Biomedical Science Building (BMS),
would be home to the medical stu-
dents before they start their clinical
training. Current students at
Charing Cross and St Mary's will
also receive their lectures there
once a week.
Situated across Hyde Park -
next to the historic Paddington
Railway Station - is St Mary's
Hospital, which has developed a
strong link with the College follow-
ing the merger of its medical school
with IC nine years ago.
The National Lung and Heart
Institute is now a division on its
own right in the structure of the
school. It boasts such distinguished
clinicians as Professor Sir Magdi
Yacoub, a world famous heart
transplant surgeon who is based at
the Royal Brompton Hospital.
Confusions sometimes arise
with the locations of the remaining
two teaching hospitals. Charing
Cross Hospital is not at Charing
Cross; instead it is in
Hammersmith, with the nearest
tube station being Baron's Court.
On the other hand, Hammersmith
Hospital, the site of the former
RPMS, is actually just north of East
Acton.
A new medical course will be
introduced with the intakes of
] 998. The incorporation of a com-
pulsory BSc year means it will be
one year longer than the current
one. However, it is expected that
those who have already got a
degree before their entry will be
exempted from the BSc year. There
are also plans to follow the exam-
ple of other medical schools,
notably UCL, and allow those who
are graduates in a medically related
subject, such as physiology,
anatomy and pharmacology, to
undertake a "fast track" course,
which will last for four years. In
contrast to the old course - which
is clearly divided into a pre-clinical
and clinical component - the new
curriculum, written with a substan-
tial amount of student input, fea-
tures clinical contacts for students
right from day one.
The 1998 intakes will be
housed with students from other
disciplines together in South
Kensington. Wilson House,
Pembridge Gardens, and Brabazon
House will be used to accommo-
unlike the other CCUs, the presi-
dent and vice-president of
1CSMSU, Katie Armstrong and Nick
Carter, are both sabbatical officers.
The sabbatical position for the
president is hoped to continue for
the next three years, as many prob-
lems still need ironing out whilst
the transition is still in progress.
The likelihood of the post being
converted into a sabbatical position
for a welfare officer (as is currently
speculated) is small because most
St. Mary's
Charing
date clinical medics and overseas
postgraduates.
The merger of the two under-
graduate medical schools has led
to the formation of a new student
union - ICSM Student Union, which
has an equivalent status to the
unions of other constituent col-
leges (the CCUs). Despite this the
medical union receives a much
greater slice of the subvention
money given by the college to the
unions. Whilst the subvention for
the other CCUs is around £13,000
a year, that of ICSM currently
stands at roughly £100,000 (this
figure is calculated by adding the
sums previously given to Charing
Cross and Mary's). Moreover,
of the funding for the post is
rumoured to have come from the
alumni associations of the medical
schools rather than from Imperial
College Union.
Some of the clubs from Charing
Cross and Mary's have already
merged, the most notable one
being the rugby clubs. The two have
for a long time been regarded as
the best teams in London. They
have played against each other in
every United Hospital Cup Final for
the last four years, with Charing
Cross claiming three victories. Last
year was the exception, when
Mary's found themselves having to
play (and subsequently beaten by)
Guy's in the final, as their tradi-
tional rival failed to get through the
first round.
The fierce sense of sibling
rivalry of the past has now been
replaced by one of unity. Not only
are they determined to recapture
the United Hospital Cup, but also
to prove themselves on the
national scene (and hopefully end
Cardiff Medical School's winning
streak). The choirs and orchestras
have also joined together to form
the new ICSM Music Society, and
Links (St John Ambulance) from the
two medical schools are now part
of the Imperial College branch.
The advantages - besides hav-
ing an invincible rugby team - are
obvious. For clinical students, the
net of teaching hospitals has
widened by combining the teaching
hospitals of St Mary's and Charing
Cross. Unlike their predecessors
isolated in a medics-only environ-
ment, the new preclinicals will have
the chance to mix in with a much
greater range of students.
However, the physical separa-
tion of sites at the moment still
presents a barrier to integration
between students from Imperial
and the medics on different sites.
There are also the logistic problems
in managing services such as stu-
dent bars at so many different
sites. The vice-president for exter-
nal affairs of CXWMSSU, com-
mented that the merger was a
good idea but more communica-
tion and discussion would be
needed with IC to ensure a smooth
transfer of services.
The merger might have officially
taken place on 1st August, but it
was the full-scale bar invasion of
1CU by students from Charing Cross
and Mary's that truly marked the
moment. The last piece of the jig-
saw may be in place, but only time
could tell if it will fit in smoothly
with the rest of the puzzle.
