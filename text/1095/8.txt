8 COLUMNS 24 October 1997
I seem to have spent far too long
banging on about the College so
far this year, giving rise to
rumours that I have thrown in
the political towel. You know me
better than that. Now seems the
perfect time to resume battle as
the Labour government's honey-
moon is rapidly ending. Not sur-
prisingly, it is Gordon Brown, who
has shattered the dream with his
masterly attempt to clear up the
confusion over EMU that so beset
the Conservatives. He has suc-
ceeded. We know for certain that
Labour haven't made their mind
up. Hallelujah! No dithering from
Gordon. This is a perfect illustra-
tion of the perils of behaving like
an opposition party when in
power. The site of Brown at the
launch of the new Stock Exchange
trading system, behind a sea of red
of his own making, would have
been hilarious, were it not for the
damage his naivete had caused. It
also serves to highlight the disturb-
ing reliance on spin doctors. Much
of 'Brown Monday' was initially
caused by his
spin doctor
Charlie Whelan,
who like his col-
leagues in this
dubious profes-
sion, seem to
wield a degree of
power that is
d e c i d e d l y
unhealthy in a
democracy. Tony
Blair must realise
that, occasional-
ly, government
have to be unpopular in the short
term in order to benefit the coun-
try. His obsession with public
opinion and approval results in
policy changes on a near daily
basis as the mood of his focus
groups oscillates. As the markets
so neatly demonstrated, this is no
way to govern Britain.
God knows
I've tried, but I
cannot let the
C o n f e r e n c e
office get away
without a men-
tion this week. It
would seem that
the Fashion week
fiasco is not an
isolated example
of mismanage-
ment. Regular
f—f visitors to
Princes Gsrdens
will have notice the frequent meta-
morphosis of the office. The latest
of these changes was, notionally,
to allow two more people to work
in the office; the necessity of that
we shall discuss some other time.
Pinning back my ears in the SCR
enabled me to hear the figure of
£26,000 for this project, a tad
generous as I'm sure you will
agree. Despite this larger sum,
they managed to spend £ 152,000.
Now I'm no expert, but that seems
a slightly larger than expected
overspend. To be fair, they cannot
be accused of cutting corners. If I
was buying office chairs for the 13
inhabitants, I would expect change
out of £1,000. I'm obviously a
cheapskate, since they spent
£8,000. The list is longer than
space here permits. This is
absolutely outrageous. It is sicken-
ing that, when we hear endless
bleating from the CVCP and others
about a funding crisis, we see fit to
lavish thousands on an outfit that
in two years has lost tens of thou-
sands. I rest my case.

We should all eat more fish. Unhygienix
is always telling us it's good for the intel-
ligence and he should know.
Unfortunately, fish tends to be expen-
sive unless you go to Bishopsgate mar-
ket (London's fish wholesalers) at 4am. I
went once, it was quite an experience
and coming back on the tube with a
whole crate of Dover sole was highly
amusing. However, it is at four in the
morning and miles from anywhere so
you may prefer to do your fishing closer
to home. In which case I recommend
you get some mackerel. This is a very
tasty, fatty fish which usually costs
between 99p and £1.20 a pound whole
(i.e. with head and tail but frequently
gutted). When fresh, mackerel have a
shiny grey-blue skin and translucent
eyes with no white flecks. There are var-
ious ways of cooking mackerel including
frying and poaching but I reckon grilling
is the best. I tried barbecue once but it
wasn't a great success - the buggers just
fell apart.
So, here's the method for beautifully
grilled mackerel. Take your fish and
clean it under running water paying spe-
cial attention to the belly cavity and gills.
If your mackerel isn't gutted, take a
sharp knife, insert the point into the fish-
es anus and slit the belly all the way to
the head. Then pull out all the 'orrible
stuff inside and clean as before. Now cut
off all the little fins. There are two near
the gills, two just behind the anus and
one on the top.
Your fish is now ready to grill but to
add some extra flavour I like to season it
with rosemary. To do this, make three or
four cuts perpendicular to the spine on
each side of the poor beasty. These
should be quite deep but not all the way
through. Now stuff copious amounts of
rosemary into the cuts and also in the
belly cavity.
Now for the grilling bit. Warm up
your grill on a medium heat and place
the mackerel under it. A half pound
mackerel should take 10-12 minutes to
cook so turn it over after 5-6 minutes.
To check whether it is cooked, slice the
fish along the spine with a sharp knife.
The skin should be crispy and the flesh
should be opaque and come off the
bones easily.
Taking the bones out of a mackerel is
a piece of cake. Simply slide your knife
all the way down the spine and then
gently lift off the fillet. The only bones
that might be left are the ones that held
the fins on the belly. Serve with a pile of
rice and something green and voila,
bonne appetit.
The same method can be used on
salmon in which case replace the rose-
mary with dill and cook for 10-15 min-
utes on each side for a fish weighing two
pounds.
