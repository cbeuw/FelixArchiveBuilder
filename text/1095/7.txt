would make no difference.
The point is that the Union of
Students is meant to be the voice
of students in College, and is sup-
posed to represent them and
defend their interests above the
interests of ANY other party, be it
the Rector, the lecturers, or who-
ever, and give the views of stu-
dents (all of them) in any matter
that affects the College. But here,
in Imperial College of Science,
Apathy and Conformism, the
Student Union seems to serve the
only function of providing cheap
beer and curries, which is great,
but it seems to retreat when under
pressure from the governing body
of the College, and will even act
against student will at times. This
Union seems to take pride in being
neutral ideologically, and not asso-
ciating with students all over the
country, and apparently it is not
ashamed of its lack of interest for
student well being. I have never
heard the Union's views on any-
thing, and if it does have views, it
keeps them very quiet, and I doubt
they reflect the opinion of the stu-
dents, since we have very few
ways of channelling our thoughts
up to the untouchables in the
union office. Even if most of the
students don't care about any-
thing, which I doubt, we still have
the right to have a say in our
Students' Union.
So there you go, 1 guess 1 can
go get pissed and sleep through
another year, and wake up for the
World Cup. And maybe by then we
can all have posters that keep the
Anything but Students' Union satis-
fied, and we can all stroll through a
walkway full of stamped posters, in
English only (because of that
healthy xenophobia we have to cul-
tivate), all in their assigned places.
And always remember: no sellotape
(reason yet to be discovered).

Hello? Hello? are you listen-
ing? Council? C O U N C I L ?
Heard of it? No? Did you read the
Handbook? Any issues of Felix?
No, I didn't think so. Council is
the sovereign, that's S-O-V-E-R-
E-I-G-N body of the Union, and
it's made up 100% by - can you
guess - STUDENTS! Students
have full control of the Union -
but you'd know that if you'd ever
bothered to contribute to it. Ed
EXCUSES, EXCUSES
It's Commemoration Day (why
isn't it called Graduation Day?
Who died?), and hundreds of the
newly departed are swanning
around the college in Batman
cloaks and velveteen trimmed
black Klu-Klux style hoods. I'm
not, I'm running round like a
blue-arsed fly trying to finish this
newspaper half a day early. Once
again, sleep has been somewhat
lacking so if this week's issue is a
bit pants, you know who to
blame. On the other hand, if you
don't think it's good enough, why
aren't you here doing a better
job?

Centre are leading the field with
some unbelievable financial cock-
ups and are current favourites for a
good pasting this year. Those of
you reading Simon Baker's column
this week will agree that they have
surpassed their Fashion Week deal
balls-up last week with their office
refurbishment running a jaw-drop-
ping £ 126,000 over budget.
The usual secrecy has made it
impossible to get the details, but
we have heard from several people
that around two thousand pounds
has been spent on the carpet,
another two thousand on a phone
system that was later ripped out,
and virtually all furniture has been
replaced even though much of it
was quality, solid furniture in good
repair.
While it is unheard of for any-
one to lose a job in Sherfield for
incompetence, I don't think I'd be
sticking my neck out to say that the
Conference Centre head, Annette
De Lima, is not a popular woman.

Stop Press 1094 "Serious Injuries
in Bar Brawl" We omitted to
mention the location of the inci-
dent - Southside Bar - and may
have inadvertently given the
impression that it took place in
the Union Building. The full
details are in this week's news
section.
News 1094 "Yes, Mr President"
In this article we did not interview
'new election' and therefore did
not give all candidates equal cov-
erage. New election will, as ever,
be standing for all posts in the
forthcoming sabbatical elections.
And yes, we still can't spell.
