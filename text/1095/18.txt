BUBBLE CUM
VIRUS
Telstar • • •
The back of this game's box gives
the impression of a virtual 'Tron'
style representation of a computer
and its files in which a devastating
virus must be hunted down. This,
as an idea for a game, I think is
great. So I eagerly installed the
game expecting a 3D shoot-em up
from the screenshots.
Virus attempts to combine the
gameplay of Descent (3D shoot-
em up) and Command and
Conquer (strategic war game). The
whole game however takes place
in a 3D 1st person perspective,
which in my opinion isn't the best
engine for a strategic game.
Combining these two types of
gameplay at first sound like a bril-
liant stroke of genius but you
quickly realise that compromises
had to be made. The action part is
pretty monotonous and there are
none of the weapons upgrades
you have become accustomed to
in this sort of game. The Virus
monsters at least in the first levels
are all very similar. The textures of
the levels too are all to repetitive
and the numerous digitised voices
such as 'You will be deleted' just
don't cut the mustard in my hum-
ble opinion.
One of the most innovative
parts of the game is the way in
which each level is mapped direct-
ly from your hard-drives directory
and file structure. Certain types of
file are also displayed in game, so
any of your TXT, BMP or WAV files
contained in the chosen directo-
ries are displayed when you enter
that part of the map. This is clever
and led to the briefest of smiles as
1 realised the games was typing
out my SCSI card 'README.TXT'
on the screen in the middle of my
game, bizarre.
I just couldn't get into the
strategic part of the game.
Without the top-down isometric
view we have all become accus-
tomed to for this sort of game it
just isn't intuitive. The map is the
directory structure and once I got
used to sending a vehicle to patrol
a certain directory or file it got a
little easier. The view as the vehi-
cle auto-pilots to its destination
isn't pretty. It jumps and
jerks everywhere crashing into
walls which doesn't put over that
finely polished touch. Also the 5
installations you can build lead to
no increase in gameplay.
The constraining factor to your
building is "KBs" not money. You
collect these from uncorrupted
files or repaired files. The idea is to
stop the virus and repair damaged
files. If you don't do your job inter-
esting things start to happen like
the display decays as your graph-
ics drivers are infected or your
mouse control is affected if the
mouse driver gets it.
The multiplayer game sounded
interesting and full network play is
supported however I couldn't get
anyone to play it as everyone who
saw it or indeed played it even for
the slightest moment disliked this
game immensely and you might
even say irrationally. If 1 hadn't
promised to review it I certainly
wouldn't have played it for more
than 5 minutes. Some good ideas
appeared throughout the game,
and the idea is great. It could have
been so so so much better. 0
