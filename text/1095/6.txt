Letters to Felix...
MONTPELIER NOT
SO BAD
Dear Felix,
We feel that your recent com-
ments regarding Montpelier Hall
are unfounded, and stirred up a lot
of ill feeling among the residents.
As a building, Montpelier Hall
has a lot to offer, with a large com-
mon room and single bedrooms
leading to a more communal
atmosphere. The facilities are
excellent with more washing
machines and flidges per head than
Evelyn Gardens. We also have irons
and washing baskets provided
unlike some other halls.
The hall boasts good entertain-
ment facilities such as a dart board,
table tennis table, grand piano and
satellite television.
The building has character,
reflected in the fact that the foyer
and staircase are listed . It's situa-
tion has to be the best of all
Imperial College halls, being nearer
to the college than Evelyn Gardens,
and within close proximity to the
best known shops in London.
On reflection, the attitude of
the residents is mirrored in the fact
that many (over 50%) would prefer
to stay here than to move into new
Southwell, and it is just another
show of Imperial College's inepti-
tude, that they have decided to sell
the building..
Yours Faithfully,
The residents of Montpelier.

DEARING REPORT
IGNORED
Dear Felix,
Thanks for the article on the
NUS campaign (NUS vs Dearing,
Felix 1094). 1 would like to make
one point clear, however. The arti-
cle claims that 'the proposals [of
the government] were recom-
mended by the Dearing report'.
This is not strictly true, the govern-
ment's proposals do not follow
those of Dearing. For example, the
Dearing report recommended con-
tinuing some form of maintenance
grant while the government pro-
poses to scrap all grants.
Yours faithfully
George Constantinides
IT'S THAT OLD
SMOKING IN THE
JCR CHESTNUT
AGAIN
Dear Felix,
I have lunch in jCR on a regular
basis, and it amazes me how many
people are smoking In there. Given
a type a typical lunchtime, there
are about 20 people smoking.
There are at least 30 signs up in
there about not smoking (even with
an easy to understand diagram, if
you can't read), yet these people
continue to do it. It's not quite as
simple as just asking people to
stop, since the usual response
goes along the lines of "get stuffed
you twat". I find it completely dis-
gusting, especially when eating.
I'm sure there are other people
with similar views.
Yours,
Richard Hopkins, Elec Eng
RANT AT RANDOM
Dear Felix,
I was in the Resource centre
the other day, and a little incident
happened (as always in this
College), nothing big, just a certain
society getting bullocked by one of
the members of ICU staff because
their posters "didn't conform to
Union guidelines". The first thing
that popped into my head was that
the Union was just giving this soci-
ety (no name) a hard time as usual
(at FF it had been a similar story).
And then 1 just imagined the walk-
way full of posters, and tried to
imagine how many of those do
conform to Union regulations... (a
grand total of about 3, all from the
ass-kissing society). Then I tried to
imagine a walkway full of posters
which did live up to the expecta-
tions of the Union... how fucking
boring. But then 1 thought: When
did the students decide the STU-
DENTS' Union guidelines? As a
matter of fact, when did the stu-
dents decide anything concerning
the Union? The students elect a
president and several other repre-
sentatives, but that is the extent of
our power in College. We can just
go get pissed for a year and come
back for the next elections, it
