INSANE CLOWN POSSE
The Great Millenko *
'We all float down
here...' Unfortunately,
they only needed one
clown for the film
version of 'It'.
T
here are some albums that
are just insanely great, others
which are to be enjoyed and
spat out, some which are frightful,
but distress the neighbours, hence
useful, and those which leave a
taste in your mouth like the curry 1
had before picking this album up.
You might not have guessed, but 1
thought The Great Millenko fell into
the last category. This isn't just a
bad album issue, this one says
something about the state of
humanity.
Not wanting to judge some-
thing on my taste alone, or taste at
all for that matter, I slept on it.
Waking up in the middle of the
night, I thought to myself; these
boys might not be making an
attempt to shock in an unoriginal
sort of way, but might instead be
making a social statement about
the monotony of life, gang culture,
an ever growing culture of medioc-
ritv. and corporate America. They
might be trying to do something
Dylanesque. Then 1 had a revela-
tion and went back to sleep. H

FESTIVAL
Plans are taking shape for what
promises to be biggest and best
London Film Festival ever.
Organised by the British Film
Institute and taking place from 6 -
23 November, at cinemas across
London, the 41st London Film
Festival will have something to
tempt everyone who loves cinema,
from film buffs to casual movie
goers.
At the heart of the festival is an
unrivalled selection of hundreds of
films from around the world,
complemented by the glamour of
the Opening and Closing Galas,
unique movie masterclasses,
Guardian interviews, film industry
seminars and conferences and
education events.
Felix will, as usual, be covering
the festival by bringing you reviews
and all the latest news from
Britain's best cinema event of the
year. Tickets are available now for
film screenings during the two
weeks and we've identified some
of the previews that really are
worth attending. They are all at the
Odeon West End in Leicester
Square.
