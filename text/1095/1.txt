Physics Leaks
Deadly Fluorine
1H
Fire crews were called in to
defuse a potentially lethal situa-
tion last week, as a leak of toxic
fluorine gas prompted an evacua-
tion of the Physics Department.
The leak originated from three dis-
used gas cylinders stored in the
basement of the Blackett
Laboratory. College officials were
alerted to the problem by building
contractors who reported an
unusual smell in the laboratory in
which they were working. The cylin-
ders, which were not labelled, were
identified by technical service staff
as containing fluorine.
Ian Gillett, College Safety
Officer, was called to the scene to
investigate, and the fire station at
High Street Kensington was
informed of the situation. Since no
college staff have been trained in
dealing with leaking gas cylinders,
the only available option was to
make a 9 9 9 call. At around 11:30,
several fire engines and an ambu-
lance arrived at the department.
The building was evacuated and
fire officers, wearing chemical pro-
tection suits, entered the laborato-
ry to remove the cylinders, which
were then placed on the lawn out-
side the building.
Prince Consort Road was
closed by the Police because of the
congestion caused by the large
number of emergency vehicles in
attendance. Although some con-
sidered the response of the emer-
gency services to be heavy-hand-
ed, the precautions taken by the
fire brigade were part of standard
procedure for dealing with
"Chemical Incidents" at College.
Professor Brian Morgan, Head
of the Physics Department, said he
was pleased with the way that all
the students quickly evacuated the
building, as well as the way in
which College Security handled the
situation.
