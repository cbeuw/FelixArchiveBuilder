EXHIBITION
FAITH
Royal Court Theatre
It's that same old war problem: The
one of orders. Orders are orders,
right? There to be obeyed, ours is
not to reason why, ours is but to do
and die. But then how far
should you go? If ordered to
do something you know is
wrong, such as execute
someone, would you go
through with it? It's an order,
after all, and the man giving
the orders must know far
better than you, mustn't he?
Faith puts us in the midst
of a battle. Four members of
a British army platoon are
relaxing in a local house a
short distance from the front
line. The strains of war are
taking their toll on the sol-
diers and just when it
appears that life really can't
get any worse, they take a
captive who turns out to be
an American mercenary. Not
wishing to strain diplomatic
relationships with the US, the
sergeant's superiors order
the mercenary's immediate
execution. The squad is left
in a moral vacuum. Should
they choose to disobey orders or to
go ahead with the execution and
somehow come to terms with their
own conscience?
For me, the best thing by far
about this play is the degree to
which the characters develop. The
sergeant, for example, has obvi-
ously been driven over the edge by
the pressure placed upon him. His
feet have been badly injured and
although he would normally be glad
for any excuse to escape, even
briefly, from the horrors of the front
line, he is eager to return to
the fray in order to prove
his courage to his disillu-
sioned troops and to him-
self. He is almost constant-
ly arguing with one of his
corporals, and an intriguing
paradox is formed. At one
point he insists that the cor-
poral follow his orders,
because he has worked and
trained his way to the high-
er rank and so is better
equipped to make deci-
sions. But, of course, once
the execution order has
been given, the sergeant
questions not only the
order itself, but his superi-
ors' right to take such deci-
sions for him.
Overall, a highly enter-
taining play. But prepare
not only to be amused, but
also shocked and down-
right appalled during the
course of the evening. O

La fedelta premiata is regarded as
one of Haydn's best comic operas.
It was specifcally written for and
first performed in 1781 on the
occasion of the opening of the new
opera house at Eszterhaza after the
old opera house had burnt down.
This is where Haydn spent most of
his creative life. It was immediately
succesful and received mor eper-
formances than any other Haydn
opera except Armida. Strangely
though, it was not performed in
this country until the Camden
Festival of 1971 and has since only
been staged twice, at
Glyndebourne and Garsington
Festivals.
The libretto by Giambattista
Lorenzi mixes scenes of high com-
edy with many moments of deep
and serious emotion which drew
from Haydn some of his finest
music. The cat 1 finale is the
longest concerted number which
Haydn ever wrote, extending to
about eighteen minutes and involv-
ing seven characters in a sophisti-
cated musico-dramatic structure

while the overture was later to
reappear as Haydn's 73rd
Symphony, La Chasse. Central to
the action is a hunt for animals to
sacrifice on the alter of Diana, the
Greek goddess of the hunt. This
scene culminates in one of the fun-
niest moments in opera: a comic
character singing an aria to a dead
boar!
The production will be directed
by Jamie Hayes, Director of
Productions for British Youth
Opera. This production will be his
debut at the Guildhall School of
Music and Drama. Thedesigner is
Will Bowen and the lighting design-
er is Ben Ormerod, whose lighting
for last spring's successful produc-
tion of Dvorak's The Cunning
Peasant was widely praised. The
opera will be sung in a new English
translation by GSDM Head of
Opera Studies, Clive Timms, who
also conducts. The performers
themselves are students at the
School which has an international
reputation for training artistes in
Music and Drama. O
