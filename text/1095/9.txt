24 October 1997 COLUMNS
Times have been tough for Robin
Cook recently. Our Foreign
Secretary has been embroiled in a
series of disputes on nearly all
continents so far, and it looks like
there's no stopping him.
His first foray into international
confrontations came with his criti-
cism of South-East Asian countries
on their human rights record.
Although commendable, the blunt-
ness in which it was said - the
wording of the statements he was
making sounded more like a bol-
locking and less like a Foreign
Secretary's diplomatic speech. Add
to this his relative youth and com-
plete inexperience in the post and
you have the recipe for a serious
international spat, with the United
Kingdom being compared to the
United States in its ability to tell
other countries what to do.
Talking of our former colonial
friends, Mr Cook has earned the
lasting hatred of one extremely
powerful bigot in the US Congress,
one Senator Jesse Helms. Senator
Helms, a right-wing southerner, has
earned his place a Chairman of the
powerful State Foreign Relations
Committee as the longest serving
Republican member, rather than
through any genuine democratic
process. Helms may be a bigot, but
he is a very clever and able one,
and there are many cautionary tales
associated with crossing him. He
managed to singe-handedly 'veto'
the selection of a prospective U.S.
Ambassador to Mexico, against the
wishes of the President, Congress
and the media. Mr Cook had a
scheduled a half-hour meeting with
the Mr Helms. It was cut short after
20 minutes. Mr Helms had not
reacted kindly to Cook's typically
blunt words, this time concerning
the U.N. which is owed a ten-figure
sum by the U.S., who are refusing
to pay until it reforms itself in a
best, (they have just charged an
eight-year old girl with an offence
that carries an automatic death
penalty, and had recently executed
a fifteen year old boy for renounc-
ing his Muslim faith). They also
have contracts with us for billions
of pounds per year. So when the

manner which the Americans would
like. Mr Helms had said "we saved
your ass twice this century, and you
come and criticise us?" Mr Cook
had apparently not taken his
department's advice on how to
treat him, deciding that confronta-
tion would be the best option. It
took all of Blair's rapport with
Clinton to mend what could have
been a damaging and needless rift.
But more was to come. After
insulting the United States, Mr
Cook quickly moved on to Saudi
Arabia, another country whose
human rights record is sketchy at
Cook responded by calling the
Saudi nation 'barbaric', which may
be true, but did much to antagonise
them in this very sensitive time. It
took much backtracking and eating
of humble pie to smooth the ruffled
feathers. The blood money pay-
ment to the victim's sister was
actually paid by the arms compa-
nies, worried about the loss of con-
tracts were the diplomatic row to
grow more serious.
Finally the latest and saddest of
Mr Cook's blunders was his com-
ments in Pakistan and India, during
the Queen's State visit. These
events are by general pro-
tocol, not to be politicised,
but Cook waded in with
comments that he could
mediate over Kashmir,
taken by the Indians in the same
light as if the Indian Prime Minister
offered to mediate over Northern
Ireland. This political comment of
Cook's was directed more Britain's
own Pakistani community, which
further enraged the Indians, culmi-
nating with their Prime Minister
calling Britain a "third-rate power",
a phrase which Raj aficionados may
remember as the early twentieth
century warning of what Britain
could become if we lost the colony.
The visit to India became marred in
many other ways stemming from
this, and has done damage in our
relations to a potential superpower
in the years to come.
So what are we to make of
Cook? He was one of the leading
lights in the Shadow Cabinet, an
intelligent left-winger, who convert-
ed to Blairism with a zeal
unmatched by many, but down
below is unchanged. His personal
relations with Helms suffer from
the contrast between left-wing lib-
ertarian and right-wing bigot, and
we could kindly attribute his
numerous gaffes to inexperience,
and a mouth which must be tamed
in his new and influential position.
Otherwise he could shoot the
whole of Britain in the foot.
