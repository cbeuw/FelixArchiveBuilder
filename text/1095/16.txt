THE
PEACEMAKER
Starring: George Clooney, Nicole
Kidman
Director: Mimi Leder
D
r Julie Kelly (Nicole Kidman)
is "only afraid of the man
who wants one nuclear
bomb" and that about sums up the
whole film; a bright spark and then
a lot of wind. The fall of the old
Soviet state has left independent
states hungry for power in the form
of weapons of mass destruction.
Russian nuclear weapons due for
decommissioning have now
become targets for would-be
dictators, terrorists and those seek-
ing financial gain.
Dr Kelly is a nuclear scientist
heading a White House investiga-
tion into a supposed nuclear
accident in central Russia.
Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe
(George Clooney) is the mandatory
army man sent as her aide.
Together they uncover a startling
conspiracy behind the accident
that could jeopardise world peace.
However, Devoe's unconventional
methods and a personal vendetta
place the Kidman/Clooney on-
screen relationship into an
immediate and blatantly obvious
"Love-Hate" spiral. Clooney's
violent outbursts (compounded by
a friend's violent death during their
investigations) gives the film a sour
edge, and allows the film makers to
add violent action scenes that
sometimes serve little purpose.The
search for the terrorists moves
across Europe into the eastern bloc
and finally into America. As this
missing bomb finds its way into
New York City the bomb hunt
becomes more frantic creating an
authentic sense of vulnerability for
all those involved.
The Peacemaker is a worrying
film since the plausibility of the
story line has been formed from
declassified intelligence reports
and factual news sources.
Corruption, the Russian Mafia and
the potential damage of a nuclear
strike have been moulded into a
Nicole Kidman searches for
some intelligence in her script
believable scenario but it would
have performed much better as a
book rather than a film. As the film
progresses, action sequences start
to take the centre stage, leading
the story into a cat and mouse
chase while the suspense is bled
dry using the time-honoured race
against the clock.
The Peacemaker is only
mediocre with the big stunt scenes
allowing for some dazzling effects
but little real excitement. Most of
the thrills last only as long as the
abrupt dialogue. Overall, a flash in
the pan that will nevertheless have
people flocking to the cinema to
see. B Magpie

A Life Less Ordinary
MA VIE EN ROSE
Starring: Georges Du Fresne
Director: Alain Berliner
I
n M a Vie En Rose, the seven
year old character of Ludovic,
played by the highly talented
new youngster Georges Du Fresne,
is a young boy who wants to be a
girl. In fact, he knows he is going to
grow up to be a girl. From this
premise, the film examines the
reactions of the people who come
into contact with Ludovic, particu-
larly his parents, as well as neigh-
bours and school friends.
The acting is excellent, particu-
larly the mother, and the director,
making his debut feature-length
film, charts the story with aplomb.
However, like the protagonist, the
film is unsure of its identity. Is it a
comedy or is it a drama? It strikes
out in a variety of directions, even
taking in a Wizard of Oz
influenced dream sequence along
the way. For all this, it is an intelli-
gent and engaging film, with
warmth and a sense of reality that
seems innate in French cinema,
and deserves special praise for
being a film based around children
and not having them act in that
nauseating "cute" manner in which
all child actors in Hollywood films
unfortunately do. L
