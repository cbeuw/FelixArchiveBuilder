That Thing RAG Do New Evacuation For
This year's RAG (Raising And
Giving) collections have got off to
a good start with the first two
making over £1600.
The first took place on the first
Saturday of term, and was part of
the annual MENCAP megaraid, in
which students from universities all
over the country take part to raise
money for the mentally handi-
capped children and adults. This
year the megaraid also had a Rocky
Horror Show theme, so many of
those taking part donned sus-
pender belts and bras in an effort
to emulate the gender-bending
characters in the cult musical.
Imperial supplied around thirty
collectors, many of whom were in
drag, but also included the con-
stituent college motor clubs, who
turned up to shake tins and to ferry
the wet transvestites around town.
Traditionally, IC students play
tiddlywinks along Oxford Street as
part of the event, but the weather
prevented this from happening, as
any fiddles (or winks) would simply
have stuck to the ground. Ignoring
the fact that the tissue paper
stuffed down a lot of the collectors
chests would have fallen out while
It is the last chance for you to
represent your fellow students as
their Union President or Deputy
President.
Candidates who want to stand for
election may only do so before
5.00pm today by signing up on the
notice board opposite the Union
Office. Those standing must have
one proposer and twenty secon-
ders backing them with their signa-
tures also on the board.
The current situation has three
people - Mark Baker (who is fully
seconded), Paula Luesling and
Andrew Heeps (who aren't fully
seconded) - standing for President
and only one, Charlie Joynt, stand-
ing for Deputy President. Their
campaign machines will soon be
off and running so if you feel you
can take the heat and beat them,
sign up now. If you would like to
bending over to play. The cold and
rain also put pay to plans to throw
the RAG chairwoman, Louise Choo
into the fountain on Piccadilly cir-
cus. This did not stop the very cold
trannies from collecting over
£1100 during the day, though.
Last Saturday also saw a collec-
tion around London, this time with
no running mascara or laddered
tights, for UNICEF and UNA. This
collection attracted a slightly
smaller following, but still managed
to raise about £500 for the chari-
ties.
Forthcoming events include a
collection for John Grooms around
London and the Sponsored Nude
Kamikaze Parachute Jump - in
which students run in the nude
from Harrods to Beit Quad (15th
of November), a collection at the
Wimbledon vs Manchester United
match (22nd of November), spon-
sored firewalking on Queens lawn
(19th of November). To get
involved, turn up at the RAG meet-
ings in dBs on Thursday lunchtimes
at 1.10pm.

Staff?

Ironically, the cylinders, which
were part of some redundant laser
apparatus, were due for removal
this week, and waste-disposal
company was already on site to
give a estimate of the disposal
costs. The apparatus had been left
in the laboratory for a long period
mainly due to reluctance of staff to
get rid of it. "The longer equipment
is left", said lan Gillett, "the higher
the risk of problems". Meanwhile,
the cylinders are still lying behind a
cordon on the Physics lawn. The
method of their disposal has still
not been decided- one possibility is
that they may be packed in sand
inside a drum and taken away to a
landfill site.
Whilst generally satisfied with
the response from students and
Southside Bar was the site of an
attack by the captain of the IC
rugby team on one of his club
members.
The incident occurred on the
Wednesday of Freshers' Week fol-
lowing some rugby matches by the
teams. Every week after a game,
the rugby and football teams con-
gregate in Southside Bar to enjoy a
drink or two amongst friends and
they usually end up becoming very
intoxicated. The first Wednesday
of the new term was no different.
After a few pints, the tradition-
al 'boat race' was held between the
two sports teams. For those not
acquainted with this competition,
it involves equal sets of people
each trying to drink a pint as fast as
possible but they can only drink
theirs after the person in front of
them has finished.
To the disappointment of the
rugby boys, the football team won.
Songs of ridicule passed between
the two respective teams as alco-
hol fueled emotions. One of tables
in the bar was damaged by a foot-
ball member who scratched the
words "FOOTBALL ONLY' on the
table that the football team was sit-
ting at. An employee from
staff, Mr. Gillett expressed con-
cern that some members of staff
failed to evacuate from the build-
ing. Staff had been seen watching
from upstairs windows when the
alarm was ringing, whilst others
decided to walk through the
Blackett Laboratory from the adja-
cent Huxley Building, where the
alarm was not ringing. This was
described by Mr. Gillett as "highly
irresponsible behaviour".
It is the first time in ten years
that such an incident has arisen at
IC. Mr. Gillett said that, although
potentially dangerous, it was han-
dled in the best possible way.
Ed Pavelin
Southside, noticed that the atmos-
phere that Wednesday night was
different saying that "things were
worse than usual".
Towards the end of the night
while the rugby team drank togeth-
er, the Firsts team captain, Oliver
Lyttleton, accidentally knocked
over his own drink. The team have
a tradition that they brought back
from Australia after their summer
tour called 'shooting the boot'.
This is a penalty where anyone
caught spilling an alcoholic bever-
age has to drink beer from their
own boot. After extensive coaxing
Oliver still refused to pay the
penalty as his shoes were expen-
sive, so one of the rugby players,
Tom Hovard, attempted to
remove it. In retaliation, the cap-
tain punched Mr Hovard leaving
him with a bad facial wound.
The Women's minibus driver,
Anne Ovens, drove Mr Hovard to
hospital where he received five
stitches.
Mr Lyttleton's attack had come
after a stressful period of captaincy
and following the incident, he
resigned his captaincy.
