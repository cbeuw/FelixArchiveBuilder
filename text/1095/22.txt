ICUGC V
HOLLOWAY
The golf club's season swung into
action with a nail-biting fixture
against the hackers of Holloway.
Having overcome some distinctly
dodgy directions to the deepest
parts of Surrey, the team clubbed
[geddit? - Si] together to almost
overcome a far-too organised
Holloway team. The top order pro-
duced solid perfromances, with
both The Mower and Marx strolling
to victory. Sadly, eveyone else
proved they were only making up
the numbers as only Arrogant
Arsehole managed to scrape a half.
Revenge has been planned for four
weeks time, when we might con-
sider playing right-handed.

Canoers lost in lido
This Weekend, the Canoe Club sent
a team of 6 Canoe Polo Players to
play in a tournament in Tooting Bee
Lido. It was the first competition
that the Club has entered, and we
did correspondingly badly. We lost
the first game against Clapham A:
7-0. We decided to bring on our
City-Boy substitute Tim, and only
lost the next game against Marlett
B 4-0. Our luck changed as we
went into the next game with some
idea of tactics, and used Shock-
Blond Sam, and "Solid Grade V"
Adam in defence, with Old-Hat
Colin in Goal. Success! we beat
Clapham B 2-0. ULU A played a
disapointing game against us (From
their point of view) only beating us
2-0. ULU B (AKA The women's
team) tried very hard to beat us,
and very nearly did, our Tall-Bloke
Jorg was very frustrated by them,
but the score: 1-1. After that the
best team of the day creamed us,
and not even our secret weapon
ULU-Traitor Daniel could do any-
thing about it: 8-0. Over all we
came 5th out of 7, and have been
invited back to play in the summer.
The only National public Snowboarding exhibition, Board - X, is
nearly upon us. After the success of the 1997 British Snow boarding
champs, we are confident that it will be the ultimate suberban
The festival runs 1 4 - 1 6 November in the British Genius site. Battersea
Park. Sponsored by Playstation Evian, Bud Ice & Kiss 100 it features a
3300 sqare metre exhibition hall and a 40m real snow half-pipe.

IC RFC II V BART'S II
IC rugby seconds demonstrated
well that what they lack in team
play they more than make up for in
individual skills. Aside from a mis-
erable first 15 minutes when we
conceded an unlucky try and drop-
goal we put Bart's under constant
pressure. It wasn't helped by the
ref having a whistle phobia.
Once the team got their arses
in gear we put them under perma-
nent pressure and were unlucky
not to score. With backs and for-
wards crashing to within millime-
tres of the line by mistake would
see us being driven back down the
pitch. With some superb individual
skills all it takes is some training
and we well soon be playing some
superb rugby.

Hockey heroes
ICHCIII V RH III
Amateurism, poor astroturf and a
ginger bus driver couldn't stop 1C
hockey from maintaing their ever-
tightening grip around the neck of
the BUSA league. After seeing off
Barts 3-1, the Holloway result
seeems indicative of the skill of
this dangerousy good-looking
team.
Goals from Indian Carpet
Catalogue and Tom saw us come
back from one down the destroy
the Holloway scum. Special men-
tion to Jesus for assists, James for
Stalwart centre play and Skank for
nearly pulling the opposition
umpire afterwards.

ICHC III V BART'S
When St Bart's rolled in, having
had a team member arrested for
indecency en-route, we knew we
were facing professionals. Our first
goal was from seasoned stiker Paul
"Skank" Currow who fought his
way free in the D, gave himself
time and flicked the ball into the
corner of the goal. Nice. Our
defence kept up their end until
half-time, while Cringer Duncan
gave our goal a lick of paint.
St Bart's unfairly got right back
into it when a momentary lapse in
concentration allowing their stan-
dard "short-nippy-blode" to test
our goalie for the first time. We
took the match to them, and Sven
Dymond proved a worthy addition,
setting up Ben "New Bloke" Jewis
to put it in the net. Skank finished
them off with a cracker.
Ben "Virgin" White deserves a
mention for having a steadier hand
on the pitch than off it, as does
Thomas Ng.

Editorial
This week has been so packed
with sporting spills and thrills that
I'm amazed. I've been inundated
with reports - so much so that
there is loads left. But do not
despair if you've handed a report
in - I'll make sure as much as pos-
sible goes in next week.
Not unconnectedly, I really
need someone to help with the
sport pages - If you are interest-
ed, just come in and leave your
number in the Felix office. Cheers,
SI.
