Guest Lecture Series
Begins
The series of special guest lectures
started off with a packed lecture
theatre in the Blackett roaring with
laughter as Ken Campbell explained
his view of science and the world of
scientists.
The comedian recounted how
he became interested in science via
the Cathars, a 10th century band of
French heretics who were mostly,
but not entirely, burned at the
stake, those who survived fleeing
to the Americas. They believed
that all matter was evil, and that
God is the almighty nothingness, or
the celestial hilarity. If this makes
no sense, you were not there. The
lecture covered his experiences in
making the program "Reality on the
Rocks", in which he attempted to
unravel the secrets of the universe
(or as he put it, what we are sup-
posed to suppose about the uni-
verse this year), interviewing count-
less eminent scientists and mathe-
maticians about the laws of
physics, and their meaning.
He revealed a knowledge of
physics that, if it did not quite
match that of the audience, was
very substantial for a lay-person,
and managed to have even the
most hardened quantum physicist
rolling around with laughter, by
simply pointing out the absurdity of
many of the things that scientists
take for granted - he was particu-
larly rude about some of the more
outlandish suggestions for why the
Young's double slit experiment
works.
Campbell seemed unconcerned
at describing CERN (with which
many of the audience have links
every day) as a 27km tube of noth-
ing, which serves to "waz" nothing
together to produce something. He
has an amazing knack of being able
to be extremely silly about physics
in particular, without getting many
of his facts wrong. He just manages
to twist them round in ways that no
one expects, like describing the
effects of time going backwards
towards a big crunch on your toilet
habits. Don't try this at home, folks.
He mixed this in with anec-
dotes about cults and other cul-
tures, and how they view the world,
and manage to time travel, a con-
cept with which he seems to be
fascinated. He also stressed his
belief in the importance of laughter,
and how ultimately, being nice to
each other will lead us to the uni-
verse that is heaven. Anyone who
was in the lecture theatre must
surely have become nearer.
The talk was one of a series
organised by Bob Speer in physics,
which cover all subjects in science.
