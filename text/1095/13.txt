his week, we have a
guest coulmnist.
Milen expounds on
the latest hip-hop and soul...
Whats up y'all!! First up how bad
is the Big Bad Mama Foxy Brown
that track blew up during the carni-
val, if you ain't checked it yet
where you been at? Anyway back
to the present and I recently
checked the new LL Cool j album
Phenomenon and it's good (con-
sidering the number of guests he
shoved on it had to be), it'll prob-
ably be competing with Busta &.
|ay-Z for hip hop album of the
year. The EMPD joint is dropping
soon and has got some wicked
reviews but 1 haven't heard it, it's
called Back in Business, if you want
a little taste check the b-side of the
Foxy track Big Bad... and you find
Never Been Seen Before and you
can see for yourself. Looking to the
future the much hyped Firm album
should be released soon, tha Firm
itself consists of Nas, Foxy Brown,
AZ &. Nature with production from
the likes of Dr. Dre & The
Trackmasters; the first single off it
is the dope FirmBiz and it should
hit the streets soon. Enough hip
hop lets move to a R'n'B tip and all
1 have to say is You Make Me
Wanna, this monster comes from
Usher and is blowin' up all over, its
been number one in states for a
time and lookin' to do same over
here. His album's called My Way
and we should be seeing it over
here soon. My favorite track at the
minute is Lyden David Hall's Sexy
Cinderella. It's another bit of nu-
soul but its tha bomb, so acquire
quick. I hear he's bringing out an
album but I got no details. Another
album soon to drop is from a
group 1 got much love for and that
is Soul II Soul's new one called
Time For a Change. Besides that
new LP's from Veronica, Taral,
Faith Evans ikYvette Michele are all
meant to drop soon, so keep an
eye out.
Later Y'all! 1

hat an opportunity, we
thought as we wandered
through the doors at
ULU, a gig sponsored by MTV and
Virgin, what free stuff will we get?
Oh yeah we get to see some bands
as well. After being kept waiting at
the door while they searched
through a list for our names, with
an MTV crew getting closer all the
time, we were confronted with the
barrage of noise that was Stony
Sleep. This heavy guitar/bass thick
3 piece had only one serious prob-
lem; they weren't very good. Their
songs were good, but the ability
behind just wasn't up to it. If they
keep going as they are, they may
be great in about a year or so's
time.
After a quick break for a beer,
the schedule being very tight as it
was, we were pulled away from the
bar by the chunking sounds of
Daytona. Well not quite chunking,
but trying their hardest. 1 thought
they were great but they seemed to
think they were a lot better and big-
ger than they were. The lead
singer/guitarist strutted about the
stage like a man possessed by the
ghost of Freddie Mercury, but with-
out the arse-wiggling. Quite a bit of

deniably the Wu-Tang's
recent Forever album was
the qpost eagerly awaited
album of its genre this year. The
hype surrounding its release was
like nothing the hip-hop world had
seen before. Next year, however,
the ears of the hip- hop world will
be tuning into the new sound of the
Beastie Boys as their long awaited
follow up to /// Communication is
released.
/// Communication was the
album that defined the summer of
1994. While people talked of the
coming of Oasis, it was the
Beasties who ruled the number one
spot on everyone's playlist at the
summer festivals. The album
brought the Boys back to the big
time and re-invented them as pio-
neers in an increasingly crowded
world.
You may ask what does all this
have to do with Hurricane? Well
he's the man behind the decks pro-
talent here, but the songs all
sounded too alike, even though
liked one song.
Running to the bar again we
quickly returned to see the M C for
the night, who we decidec was
some bloke off MTV, shouting and
waving, and basically looking stu-
pid. Eventually he introduced 'The
Kings of Infinite Space' as
Liverpool's finest, only to be disap-
pointed when his shout of '...any-
one here from Liverpool?' was
answered by only one fairly pissed
bloke, who was being held up by
his mates, in the most beautiful
southern accent. The band them-
selves were quoted as saying that
they had influences from Abba,
Bowie and T-Rex, so we braced
ourselves for a blast of Glam
Cheese. However what we got
could not have been more differ-
ent. A loudish, polished set of pret-
ty standard one guitar, loud distort-
ed bass songs, with nothing really
to distinguish them from any other
band. A bit boring really.
The gap for the last band was
slightly longer, but still not quite
long enough for more than a quick
pint. We wandered slightly less
steadily back into the hall, ready for
ducing a large part of the Beastie's
sound, and has been doing so since
1988 and the not so brilliant days
of Licenced To III. His pedigree
does not, howevery stop there for
as early as 1975 he was rhyme
fighting with the likes of
Grandmaster Flash, and in true hip-
hop style he moved on to body-
guard on tour for Run DMC, which
was where he met up with the
Beasties.
As for the music, the sound of
this, his second album, leaves his
previous, less than spectacular
attempt in the shadows. The sound
is altogether more wholesome than
what has come before, and lessons
have obviously been learned about
the current mood. Japanese Eyes
and Coast To Coast stand out with
a sound that takes influences from
all corners of the hip-hop world,
and the rest of the album does not
disappoint either.
The main problem with
the headlining band of the evening;
Addict. They came on to large
applause, especially from the
group of groupie girlies in front,
with tight tops and little pathetic
rucksacks on their backs. They
looked like a good band. Confident
and happy to be there, even
though the place was half empty.
Their set was well put together with
about half quiet, ballady songs and
half loud bouncy songs, but there
was just something about them.
They were technically very good,
their songs were good, but they
just annoyed me. And the lead
singer told us that they were tour-
ing with Mark Owen soon. Hooray,
now I have two reasons to avoid
him.
Addict finished just before 11,
and the bar closed soon after we
bought the round. The ULU stew-
ards, in my opinion, should be
given a talking to. As soon as the
bar stopped serving they threw us
out, and then told us off for taking
drinks downstairs. Never mind.
And there was no free stuff, which
always annoys me. All in all a good
night out, even if the bands weren't
great. H
Billy
Hurricane is that he has always
been an also-ran, lacking the bite
and quality of his contemporaries.
His contribution to the Beasties'
sound should not be underestimat-
ed, but on his own he has never
been able to quite live up to the
promise. This album is a step for-
ward, but is still not an album of the
quality I would like.
Hurricane number one? Maybe
next year. H
