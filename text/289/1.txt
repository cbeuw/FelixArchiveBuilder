The Union Loses
a Good Friend
The sudden death of the
Pro-Rector, Lord Jackson, on
Tuesday, 17 February, has
removed from the College
one of its best known and
most respected figures. The
immediate response of those
who heard the news was the
personal one associated with
the loss of a friend, for he
had the gift—with staff and
students alike—of quickly
identifying himself with the
problems of others.
The initials, W.J., by
which he was widely known
are linked both inside and
outside the College with El-
ectrical Engineering, although
it was almost by chance that
this was his professional in-
terest. His intention was to
study Chemistry, but in the
vacation before entering
Manchester University as an
undergraduate he worked in
a power station and found
the problems arising in this
environment so fascinating
that he enrolled for the Elec-
trical Engineering degree. By
1946, when he first joined
Imperial College as the Head
of the Electrical Engineering
Department, W.J. had estab-
lished a reputation for his
leadership of a Manchester
University research team,
which made many significant
contributions to the micro-
wave techniques essential for
the wartime development of
radar. The College at that
time was poorly equipped
and understaffed as a result
of the war and W.J. embark-
ed on a reconstruction pro-
gramme which provided full
scope for his organisational
abilities and his life-long de-
votion to bridging the gap
between Unversities and In-
dustry. Many features of the
present undergraduate course
were introduced during this
period and are now accepted
as essential. They include in-
dividual final-year projects,
emphasis on the importance
of the presentation of tech-
nical information and student
colloquia and have the com-
mon aim of providing stu-
dents not just with a factual
knowledge of electrical en-
gineering but with an appre-
ciation of the practical prob-
lems met by electrical engin-

Lord Jackson of Burnley
eers. W.J. consistently argued
for the recognition of tech-
nology as an activity distinct
from science but was equally
aware of the importance of a
scientific foundation for
engineering studies. He
strengthened the undergradu-
ate course by including more
basic theory and in particu-
lar, his early interest in
chemistry was reflected by
the stress which he placed
on the need for studying the
properties of materials.
By 1953, the department
was in a flourishing state
with a staff well able to ad-
apt courses to the rapidly
changing nature of electrical
engineering—for example the
department was the first in
this country to include tran-
sistors as an undergraduate
subject. The same staff, with
continuous backing and en-
couragement from W.J. es-
tablished several major re-
search groups which continue
their contribution to the ad-
vancement of electrical en-
gineering—a tribute to his
vision in selecting areas of
development and in picking
the men to achieve results.
In 1953 it appeared unlikely
that the size of the College
would increase and W.J.—
possibly believing that he had
made his contribution to the
College—accepted an invita-
tion to become Director of
Research and Education for
A.E.I. (Manchester), a com-
pany perhaps better known
by its previous name Metro-
politan-Vickers, and one with
which he had had very close
connections. This post en-
abled him to tackle his prime
interest of welding together
educational and industrial
activities from the industrial
side and the cogency of his
arguments for such integra-
tion led to his becoming in-
creasingly involved in nation-
al policies relating to the em-
ployment, education and
training of technological and
scientific manpower.
His connection with the
College remained a close one
and he returned, in 1961,
again as Head of the Elec-
trical Engineering Depart-
ment, to participate in a
major expansion involving
the move to the present El-
ectrical Engineering build-
ing. Once more, he took the
opportunity to broaden the
educational pattern of the
undergraduate course, for ex-
ample by the provision of a
language laboratory and a
T.V. studio for student use.
His concern with technology
policy on a national scale
naturally led him to devote
his attention to College,
rather than purely Depart-
mental problems, and he
played a major part in the
introduction of the inter-de-
partmental M.Sc. course in
Materials Science and in the
formation of the Centre for
Computing And Automa-
tion. From 1967, as Pro-
Rector, he worked unceas-
ingly to ensure that Imperial
College maintains its present
place as a leader in Scien-
tific and Technological Edu-
cation by adapting its poli-
cies to meet changing situa-
tions and by continuing its
tradition of pioneering new
educational methods. Two
matters to which he gave
particular attention were di-
versification of courses and
the danger that over-empha-
sis of the departmental struc-
ture should exclude desirable
academic developments.
There are many activities
in the College by which
Lord Jackson will be remem-
bered. Those of us who had
the good fortune to work
closely with him will also re-
member how much we have
learned by observing him in
action. The most important
things one learns—as Lord
Jackson himself frequently
recalled—are from the people
one works with. In my case,
I am grateful to have learn-
ed from him of the need for
a balance betwen my desire
for the pursuit of private re-
search and the claims of
wider responsibilities.
We are indebted to Pro-
fessor Brown for writing this
obituary for Felix.
C. and G. Triumph
by our motoring correspondent
After three years in the wilderness, City and Guilds swept
the board at the Annual Twenty-four Hours Pedal Car race
held at Bristol last Friday.
In terrible conditions City and Guilds won the Class 1 cate-
gory and the handicap prize for vehicles with wheels up to 14
inches in diameter, by over 30 laps, despite attempted clog-
ging by R.C.S., who came second.
The Class 2 category, for vehicles with wheels of diameter
between 14 and 21 inches, was won by a team from Alder-
maston Weapon Research Establishment.
This year's course was, as usual, at Whitchurch Airport
near Bristol, but was longer than previous courses. Never-
theless, all the ninety-odd teams taking part clocked up faster
average times than ever before, and C. & G. did 500 laps!
For the last four years R.C.S. have always won one or both
of the categories. Last year C. & G. were blighted by a broken
crankshaft on one vehicle and a collapsed frame on the
other.
Gardens
Aglow
In the early hours of
Thursday last week, the resi-
dents of Prince's Gardens
were treated to the thrilling
sight of London's Fire Bri-
gade in action. These intre-
pid anti-pyrotechnists arrived
in force (4 appliances, lights
flashing, sirens clanging)
accompanied by 3 fuzz-
mobiles and a Black Maria,
to find a section of road
about 6 foot by 1, blazing
away with flames reaching
the incredible height of 6
inches. 3 fire-appliances, 2
fuzz-mobiles and the Black
Maria left, while the remain-
ing fire-engine ran out a hose
and waited for the Gas
Board.
A resident of Garden Hall,
over-come perhaps with
community spirit, attempted
to put out the fire on his
own, with a bucket of water
from his window; unfortun-
ately, he missed by some 25
yards, and a group of about
half a dozen rubber-neckers
had occasion to regret his
good intentions.
Another group of bystand-
ers offered to apply their
used beer to the flames, and
hence extinguish them; but
this was met with nothing
more than a crude rejoinder
from the friendly driver of a
departing fuzz-mobile.
After about an hour, the
Gas Board arrived, turned
off the gas, and everyone
went home.
Whither
R.C.S.?
The RCS Union meeting
held on Tuesday, 17th Feb-
ruary in Physics lecture
theatre 3 must rank as one
of the greatest ever demon-
strations of apathy in the
long history of RCS. A mere
twenty-seven people turned
up to discuss a new constitu-
tion for the Union, intended
to rationalise its structure,
especially with reference to
the new increased influence
of ICU. A working party was
set up at the previous Union
meeting to produce a new
constitution and they duly
completed their allotted task
over several cups of coffee in
Southside. The working
party of six produced a com-
mendable report considering
the short time it had for its
deliberations.
President John Butter-
worth stood down from the
chair in order to present the
working party's report. Dave
Howard, well known objec-
tor at both IC and RCS
union meetings, was elected
to the chair, where he trea-
ted the masses to a know-
ledge of standing orders
rarely seen at Union meet-
ings.
