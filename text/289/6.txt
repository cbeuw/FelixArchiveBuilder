Careers Careers
There are careers adver-
tisements all around to
attract your attention, there
are appointments officers in
each department to light the
ways you are most likely to
go, there's something called
vocational guidance in case
you go wrong, and there's
the labour exchange for
when you're down and out.
Life is streamlined, you're
turned out of school into the
University sausage machine
where they proceed to stuff
you with as much technical
and scientific knowledge and
know-how as they can in
three or four years; from
there you're shunted into a
career, which may be the
vocation you've always
wanted, but could be the
least boring of a choice of
appallingly boring jobs, or
perhaps you pull yourself on
to a P G course and postpone
any fateful decision.
Being an undergraduate
gives you a feeling of false
security, you oan't imagine
the time when you may have
to use some initiative and
common-sense to look after
yourself in a world where
you have to do something
other than be taught. The
careers advisory service in
your final year is specially
geared to get you "fixed up"
before you leave, so as few
as possible students actually
graduate without one foot
tentatively placed on the next
rung in tine success ladder.
Several newly-graduated
students have already taken
on responsibilities when they
leave, of course, and are
naturally attracted by the
thought of a secure job with
a definite salary. Others
have a definite career
planned when they start their
course and may already be
connected to a firm by hold-
ing an industrial scholar-
ship. The great majority find
a job in the course of attend-
ing numerous interviews
before their final exams,
keeping a careful eye on the
salary offered, opportunities
open, chances for improve-
ment, relative interest of the
work etc etc. They may
change the firm they work
for and change the depart-
ment they work in, but, once
Chosen, very few will change
their way of life.
When firms come here
they don't just look for the
Rutherfords and Thompsons
of the future; academic
brilliance is a good ticket to
a fat wage packet, but so
is a mediocre degree and a
position of some respon-
sibility in the Union,
although some distinction
has to be made between a
job in a highly specialised
corner of your own subject,
and a job you get through
showing abilities in organisa-
tional and management
fields, with a degree denot-
ing some academic aptitude.
Some firms come with only
a very few places to fill,
others, including some of the
very big ones, take on as
many promising graduates
as possible to prevent them
being snapped up by com-
petitors. If you want to be
a teacher, you could find
yourself in a position of
never being out of work for
very long, with excellent
holidays, but starting with
very little pay without much
hope of any substantial in-
crease for a long time.
You're unlikely to hear
much about the drawbacks
of any profession until
you're experiencing them,
(and that applies to a course
at University too, in case
you hadn't noticed).
Which leaves me trying
to summarise: some choice
has to be made, there are
innumerable avenues open,
and you've got to do some-
thing when you leave here.
The college appointments
board is there to help as part
of their job, firms are eager
to help you and so help
themselves, it's up to you to
make sure you don't make
a decision now which you
will regret greatly in a few
years time. No matter how
much advice you take and
listen to, there's never any-
one left to blame when
things go wrong but your-
self.
