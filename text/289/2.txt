Israel Week
at IC
Wine, food, singing and
dancing from Israel will
highlight the Israel Week
which has been organised by
the Jewish Society at Im-
perial College. This will be
held from Monday March
9th until Friday March
13th and the main event will
be a party on the Wednes-
day of the week.
One of the attractions
lasting throughout the week
will be an exhibition of many
different aspects of the
Israeli state, including scien-
tific development, industry,
commerce, and the social and
cultural scene. The exhibi-
tion will be held in the junior
common room of College
Block, and will be sup-
plemented every lunchtime
with the sale of a quick cheap
Israeli snack called
"Felafel". This is very
popular among Israelis and
it will be sold at 2/- a time.
There will be a sale of Jaffa
oranges and, in addition,
there will be a travel desk
supplying information and
answering questions about
Israel. Booklets are readily
available for anybody ex-
pressing interest. All pro-
ceeds from lunchtime sale
will go to the carnival.
During the week there is
a full programme:—
On Tuesday night, a guest
speaker, Arnold Flax, will
give his views on the
"Kibbutz", discuss its
sociology and from personal
experience will relate what
it is like to live in a com-
munal settiement. On Wed-
nesday, at the Israeli Party,
with the help of an Israeli
entertainer, you may learn
how to dance the Hora and
how to sing Israeli songs.
Wines with salad and
felafel will provide adequate
refreshment for the evening.
On Thursday evening
another guest speaker will
be discussing Israel as a
modern country, as a
Jewish state, and as a
sociological and tech-
nological success.
The organisers of the
week stress that the events
are nondenominational, and
anyone who wishes to know
more about modern Israel
will find plenty to keep him
occupied during the week.
Stale News
Department
Approximately 300 stu-
dents took part in the solemn
moratorium procession on
Shrove Tuesday. Wreaths
were laid in front of the
Admin. Building and the
marchers listened to speeches
by Piers Corbyn, Dave
Yorath of the N.U.S. exec,
and Seamus McBrade of the
A.A. There followed a short
occupation of the senior
common room and an at-
tempt to see Lord Penney. A
small group of the demon-
strators entered the adminis-
trative duplicating room and
took away copies of a letter
from Lord Penney to the staff
of I.C. As he had not had the
courtesy to explain his posi-
tion to the students these
letters were distributed to
various departments.
Of about equal effect on
the administration were the
pancake races held in Beit
Quadrangle. The main pur-
pose for everyone there was
to soak everyone else, the
hotter the water the better.
Above: Marchers come to a halt outside Lord Penney''s
residence to deposit a wreath. The gibbet remained unused.

Barry (David Bailey) Pywell.
The biggest hit in
the cinema today!

CLASSIC Piccadilly
TOUCHSTONE
Silwood Park, Imperial
College's field station in
Surrey, is a large manor, set
in fertile country south of
Windsor. To the right, and
partially hidden from the
building, are the concrete
army-like huts which serve
as the refectory and sleeping
quarters to the staff. It's
here that the Touchstone
coach finally draws up and
students quickly pile out to
be sure of claiming a bed in
the huts allocated to them.
After a brief buffet tea,
the guest speaker, Professor
Niblett, begins the con-
ference with a talk which
introduces many of the topics
that will be analysed at the
weekend.
After questions everyone
retires to the bar, where
Piers Corbyn and others are
to be found sipping Coke and
anxious to discover what
they have missed. The even-
ing meal is well prepared
and leisurely eaten; and
after coffee and cigarettes,
social groups start reform-
ing in the main building.
The forty or so present then
break into three discussion
groups in the library, study
and lecture theatre. Question
sheets were distributed and
for two hours there is much
talk in and around the
topics that they suggest.
More coffee and more talk-
ing — with a passionate dis-
cussion going on till two in
the morning.
Sunday morning at Sil-
wood means walks in Great
Windsor Park or to the
"Seven Stars" and back at
one for lunch. Summaries of
the discussions begin in the
afternoon with a talk from
the guest speaker giving his
impressions of the weekend,
and once more a brief dis-
cussion begins. Then a
buffet tea, hurried packing,
and the coach journey
through London suburbs to
be back at the Union arch
by six. ,
