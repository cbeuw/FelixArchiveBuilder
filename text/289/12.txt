hr COUNCIL KS&'I^MQ LAbib
The natural flow of witty,, informed dismission at Monday's 1-g- hour Council
meeting was interrupted by a 4 hAur debate on motions to be put to too NUS conference,
with several exciting challenges to the chair and a steady procession of pints from the
bar. Faets i n the accaapanying bumph-buraph sheet; the number of people decayed
exponent!anally as the standard of ciiairmanship (piers says he was i l l ) went from bad to
worse and at 11 o'clock there were & left so the meeting folded. The main business was
conducted by Alan Lafferty who read a l l the motions to be put to the NUS conference and
tabled amendments suggested by Council
As mentioned in the article above, I . C , Council discussed amendments to motions of
the NUS confarence at the end of March.
Besides adding ICU's name to a number of amendments tabled by ojrher colleges, ICU is
to amend a few other motions off its own bat, and intends to put two amendments to a UGM
for Union approval.
They are "the Wilson g o v e r n m e n t , , . » , . lias created the conditions for a I-owellite
Tory Government", to be added to a motion on grants and an amendment to a motion on
Diversification, which Piers Corbyn w i l l make up, as soon as he had decided what to amend.
LETTER
Dear Editor,
It appears that the idea of USK has at last blossomed. Last Thursday an IC
external affairs meeting was called, which turned into an impromptu USK meeting.
The f i r s t and possibly the most important item to be discussed was the
formation of an USK committee. The following proposal v/as made by Piers Corbyn.
President (or representative' and USK officer and External Affair's officer of each college
together with RCA - 2 members
IC - 3 members
RGM, IPSO, Chelsea, GEM and MA - 2 members each,
also the USKHEET editor and the USK Fund Treasure!" to form the committee.
The committee elects i t s own chairman and secretary from any member of the
Colleges who applies. It should be noted here that C$30, after 2 years of distain, have
again shown interest. The college of St. Mark and St. John, in Chelsea, have now asked
for peorle to go and see them to explain what USK i s a l l about.
The idea of a USK handbook was suggested, flawing this from the present ICU
handbook. Two co-editors :'rom MA have agreed to take on the monumental task of co-ord-
inating between the Colleges*
An appeal was made by myself to the /.xternal ..ffairs Committee for an increase
of £30 in their support for the USK Kntsheet, because 1C i s receiving an unrepresentative
number and i t was f e l t thac this cost for extra copies should be borne by IC alone and not
by the USK fund. This has been referred to the Publications Board, which meets on Friday
2?th, John Edwards.
BBC TV CAMERAS A ! I . C . "THE NEW VOTERS"

The subject of this prograimse i s THE NEW VOTERS, and young people from different
staial and intellectual grounds were asked to give their views on ourrv/nt p o l i t i c s .
This could be worth watching - even for those who are not appearing
