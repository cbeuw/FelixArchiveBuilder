MORE R.C.S.
The main recommenda-
tions are (i) the office of Vice
President of the Union to be
abolished in favour of a new
post of Charity Carnival
Organiser in an attempt to
streamline Carnival collec-
ting in RCS. For long
enough the Vice President
has had no worthwhile offi-
cial function to perform,
save decorating Union meet-
ings and impersonating
Theta.
(ii) The number of Union
meetings is to be slashed to
four per academic year.
These will be a freshers meet-
B.O.S.T.
RUMOURS
Rumours have been re-
ceived about the discussion
at the Feb. 18th BOST
(Board of Studies) meeting
which 'decided to decide at
or after the end of term' on
student representation. The
decision, although quite in-
conclusive, represents a vic-
tory for the moderates and
progressives on the BOST.
The main opposition
group consisted of Profs
Barrer (Head of Chemistry),
Ball (Head of Metallurgy),
Ubbelohde (Head of Chem.
Eng.), Sparkes (Dean of C.
and G., Civ. Eng.), and
Fleming (Dean RSM, Head
of Mining and Min. Tech.).
At the meeting minority ob-
jections were raised about
President Corbyn — that he
and 'his friends' were not
representative, and he was
unwelcome on the BOST.
On hearing this rumour
afterwards, Corbyn said that
obviously — like any pre-
sident — he was not an
average student, but that he
put forward explored and
expressed Union policies, as
decided by the Union. "Pre-
sumably certain Profs would
like students on the BOST
who did or could not do
this," he said.
ing at the beginning of the
Autumn term; a hustings
meeting in the Spring term
to be followed by a meeting
when the election results will
be declared; and an A G M at
the end of the year.
(iii) Constitutional chan-
ges will in future only re-
quire a two thirds majority
at one Union meeting, in-
stead of needing to be
approved at two successive
meetings as at present. This
is clearly a rational step with
a reduction of the number of
meetings to four.
(iv) The welfare of RCS
students will in future be
solely in the hands of I C U —
the body best felt equipped
to look after this matter.
Under the present consti-
tution, this new constitution
must be approved by tw<S
Union meetings and having
been passed by those present
on the 17th, must go before
another meeting to be held
in the very near future. It is
to be hoped that a lot more
people turn up then to dis-
cuss this important matter.
However at the present
time it appears that it's going
to take a lot more than a
new constitution to inject
new spirit into a very ailing
institution. Dynamic leader-
ship is an absolute neces-
sity for the future of RCSU
as an institution worth pre-
serving: at the moment such
leadership is sadly lacking.
Corbyn = N.U.S.?
Piers Corbyn has been
nominated for a post on
NUS executive to one of the
7 junior posts (executive
officer or executive com-
mittee member). The elec-
tions take place at the N U S
National Conference. The
post is not sabbatical and
Corbyn has said that since
there are 80 full-time staff
in N U S he can and will
make sure that the post does
not interfere with his Physics.
He hopes to make students
'more aware'. He would be
one of the very few science
students on NUS executive
if elected.
Felixprobes - a Hop
"It's all at the hop." So runs a line in a pop song which
any reader over twenty will remember. To check whether
the old adage still holds in this permissive age, I decided to
try the latest 1970-style I.C. hop, the main attraction being
Free, despite the fact that tickets cost 10 shillings. (One
hopes that when the fifty new pence appear at I.C. the ar-
rangement will be reciprocated, and free admission will be
allowed).
Having passed through the outer defences, the second
line proved easily penetrable, and there it was, the Hop.
A quick half, (no pint glasses), in the Union Lower
with my friend, and then up to the Concert Hall where it
was all happening. We had arrived just before Free were
about to begin their stint. The first point that was brought
home was that the old cattle-market image of the Hop has
gone, and I am told that with the better quality groups this
year, the majority of the people come to listen, and since
this is more comfortably done sitting down, sit down they
do. The cattle-market has now moved to the discotheque,
and having acquired one's catch, the after sales service be-
gins with watching the group.
Free obviously command quite a large following, for
half the Concert Hall was filled with people sitting down.
The fans were obviously pleased with the group's perfor-
mance, for after an hour of hard rock an encore was called
and answered. The group's music was supplemented by an
agile display by the lead singer dancing with the mike stand,
and also by the grotesque facial expressions of the lead
guitarist.
The old adage still holds. "It's all at the hop."

N MEETING
Meeting opened at 1.17
and the minutes, just for a
change, were read to about
280 students. Steve Cooke
was declared Maths depart-
mental rep., being unop-
posed, and a M r . Hedley de-
clared Mech. Eng. dep. rep.
also unopposed. Piers said a
short tribute to the late
Lord Jackson, and there was
a letter from Frances Camp-
bell on behalf W.L.S.A.B.,
the West London Students
Accommodation B u r e a u ,
which is now living at 8
Princes' Gardens.
After a letter from the
A A thanking us for our
support, Dave Yorath of the
NUS talked on the future of
the Architectural Associa-
tion, and then the fun
started with a letter from
Stephenson in his capacity
as chairman of the Refectory
committee.
The letter was about the
last Union meeting, and
was based mainly on several
niggling complaints about
time - keeping, q u o r a c y
doubts. One quote was "I
doubt whether more than 3
or 4 students know what a
pot-washing machine is."
After the letter was read,
John Goodman promptly
proposed a motion of no-
confidence in M r . Stephen-
son as chairman of the re-
factories committee, and des-
cribed the letter as "bloody
disgusting."
Dave Howard spoke
against the motion with
some lack of sincerity (in-
tended) and the motion was
c a r r i e d overwhelmingly.
Professor Alexander of
the Mechanical Engineering
dept. rose to ask what stu-
dents hope to contribute to
the BOST or other com-
mittees. When asked if he
was a member of the Union
he replied that he was a life
member, as were most mem-
bers of staff, who did not
bother to come to Union
meetings because they
thought the students could
control their own affairs. In
reply to his original ques-
tion, Dave Wield pointed
out that they had contri-
buted to the workings of the
BOST already, in that the
BOST had been talking
about them since last June.
John MacAdam spoke in
favour of withdrawing all
representation from the com-
mittees, but went on to sug-
gest we set up our own ad-
ministration in opposition to
the college.
Les Ebdon accused Prof.
Alexander of admitting that
he knew nothing of what
the students wanted, and
said that no sooner was re-
presentation allowed on a
committee than all power
was withdrawn from it. The
whole thing was a farce, he
said. Dave Howard spoke
again against direct action,
and someone immediately
proposed a speech advocat-
ing just that. This motion
occupied the rest of the time
of the Union meeting, which
closed in no recognisable
manner about quarter past
two.
