Tiny Alice by Edward Albee
Brilliant acting by David Warner and the rest of the
cast; the play itself is imaginative in usual Albee style. It
Progresses from personal conflict as in Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf to a more abstract form of theatre. Tiny
Alice is a heiress of untold fortune who wishes to donate a
portion to the Church. This involves unforseen consequences,
the development of which forms this mystic play.
Come As You Are by John Mortimer
Four short sex comedies situated in various districts of
London. The stage production is clever and the sets are very
exotic, but the playlets have very Utile to say. Of the four,
Christmas Eve at the home of a Bermondsey publican and
scene set in a once famous actress's Marble Arch flat. The
acting was good, Celia Bannerman coping extremely well
with her difficult parts, however Glynis Johns was not up to
her usual standard.
It's A 2ft. 6in. Above The Ground World by Kevin Laffan
Set in Liverpool, this play is based on the Roman Catholic
v. contraception conflict. On the whole the acting is fair. The
performances of Antony Webb and Prunella Scales stand out
in this comedy with serious aspects.
LUNCHTIME THEATRE
AT THE GREEN BANANA
The Ambiance Lunchtime
Theatre Club, ex-Queens-
way in Bayswater last week
opened up a new season of
plays at the Green Banana
Restaurant off Tottenham
Court Road. The opening
work of the season is "How
are your handles", three
humourous sketches from
English class life by N. F.
Simpson best known for his
"With a Resounding Tinkle"
and "The Hole".
The tide of the sketches
comes from the first in
which an unnamed, un-
known man comes in and
questions the housewife
about the handles in her
home. "Do they feel good?
Are they aesthetically pleas-
ing? Is she satisfied with
them? Where did they come
from? "
The housewife concludes
that she is satisfied with them,
as with the walls, windows,
shelves, the whole house in
fact. No, she had nothing to
do with putting them there
P O R C I L E
but she's very satisfied with
them . . .
The other two sketches are
about equally inane (yet
equally possible?) situations
one involving an artist who
is away growing the bemp
with which to weave his can-
vas (so that he can keep
complete control of his
painting) the other a dia-
logue between husband and
wife when the husband re-
turns home at 3 in the morn-
ing and claims to nave spent
the evening deciphering
tombstone inscriptions.
It all makes for an enjoy-
able lunchtime and is cer-
tainly better theatre than
you'll find at Union meet-
ings.
It's also cheap — 5/-
student membership and 2/6
entrance, and there is an in-
teresting programme includ-
ing the premier of Samuel
Beckett's "Three Dialogues
with Georges Duthuit" next
month,

As a final note on the Mooney saga, we seem to have
neglected the washing-up staff in the Union. In compensation
we would like to mention them here as the Union lower
Refec at least does not seem to suffer from the dirty cutlery
which plagues the others.

In the background a villa
with steps leading down to
green lawns and a long orna-
mental pond. In the fore-
ground a yellow butterfly
settles on the brown dust. A
wild eyed figure approaches,
captures the butterfly, and
eats it. The two worlds
which seem to meet at the
beginning of the film diverge,
but remain linked, one act-
ing out the thinly veiled
violence of the other.
In the villa, the German
Nazi and his wife and son
and a story unfolding
around one of his former
associates, a doctor who took
his research subjects from
the gas chambers.
On the villa's estate pigs
wallow in the stys and
among the hills men run wild
killing, raping and eating.
Scenes are reminiscent of
Pasolini's Oedipus Rex.
Figures in white tunics,
weapons clanking as they
chase enemies over the
brown mountain paths, and
the same slightly fear
exuded by the quarry.
Like Oedipus Rex, the
atmosphere is remote, per-
haps these scenes only exist
in the mind of the son. He
is the central figure of the
play, totally indeterminate
and supporting neither his
Nazi father, nor his pacifist
girlfriend. He is subject to
prolonged trances when his
mother, watching by his bed-
side murmers "like Christ on
the Cross. . ."
The film is horrible but
compelling, pulling you into
its inner world, and full of
puzzles. What did finally
happen to the son? What
was the secret, never made
explicit, behind his stealing
the pigs? Your guess is as
good as mine.
