RODIN
THE MAN AND HIS WORK
"Balzac": Rodin's masterpiece
The French sculptor
Auguste Rodin was born in
1840. As a student of
classical statuary, ithere need
have been no fundamental
conflict between him and
the 'establishment' at that
time. It was after his father's
death that he finished what
he regarded as his first major
work, The Man with the
Broken Nose. He entered it
for exhibition at the
Academy of Arts who with
characteristic stupidity re-
jected it. Rodin despised the
outward appearance of
'finish' and lack of emotional
depth that the Academicians
seemed to hold so dear. But
as a consolation for his bad
reception he met a woman
Who believed in him, Marie
Rose Beuret, who became
bis mistress and gave him a
son in 1866.
In 1876 after his visit to
Italy, Rodin's art changed
forever, he had captured
Michelangelo's feeling for
the eternal, which he fused
into his own work. In 1881
Rodin was engaged on the
working of a massive collec-
tion of sculptures called
'The Gates of Hell'. The
photograph of Adam shown
here was to be included in
this work, however, suffi-
cient funds were not avail-
able for its completion. (A
statue of Eve was also
doomed to remain unfinished
since the model became
pregnant and vanished with
her Russian seducer) in the
photograph of Adam it is
easy to see the influence of
Michelangelo, the pointed
finger is from the fresco,
Creation of Adam, in the
Sistine Chapel, and the bent
right leg, the inclination of
the head derive from the
dead Christ in Michelangelo's
Pieta at Florence.
In London
In the winter of 1881
Rodin journeyed to London
to learn dry point technique
at the Slade School of Fine
Art. Rodin's popularity was
now growing, he began to
become fashionable i n
Parisian high society. The
next year Rodin met one of
the prime passions of his fife
the sculptress, Camille
Claudel, who became his
student, mistress and model.
She was the model for his
sculpture shown, called
Triumphant Youth. Much of
the eroticism of Rodin's
work at this period was due
to Camille Claudel's in-
fluence. A marble of The
Kiss was completed and
promptly hidden away
because of its 'possible
effect on public morals'.
In the spring of 1889
Rodin held a joint exhibi-
tion with Claude Monet, the
same year that he received a
commission for the monu-
ment to Victor Hugo. In the
years up to 1898 Rodin com-
pleted the Burghers of Calais
and what some consider to
be his greatest work, the
Monument to Balzac. If
you look at the photograph
of the 'Balzac' shown you
will notice that it is not
quite lifelike. Rodin wanted
to show the inner, eternal
man, not the superficial
mannerisms and features.
However the Salon again
acted characteristically and
rejected Rodin's 'Balzac'
because, in their opinion, it
was unfinished. This dis-
appointed Rodin cruelly
since he had lived, slept and
dreamed Balzac since he
had started the commission.
Another blow to his peace
of mind came with his break
with Camille Claudel.
Although he had two trium-
phant tours of Holland and
England in the years lead-
ing to 1905, he never quite
recovered from this double
blow.
Affair
In the year 1905 Rodin
began a disastrous associa-
tion with a peculiar woman,
the Duchesse de Cloiseul
nicknamed by her contem-
poraries, the 'muse'. This
love affair resulted in the
estrangement of many of
Rodin's dearest friends.
Despite the unhappiness and
suffering in Rodin's life at
this time he managed to
make several lively and ex-
pressive busts of tne 'Muse'.
When modelling her she lay
down on her back, head
turned towards the light, her
neck firmly between his
knees, while he modelled
with his thumb touching
first her flesh then with his
thumb still warm modelled
the part he had just touched.
Rodin received full recog-
nition in his own lifetime, a
fate not shared by many of
his contemporaries. Rodin
was not to enjoy his success
for long, for on the 14th
February 1912 Rose Beuret,
now Madame Rodin, died.
Rodin's spirit was finally
broken. In November of the
same year he contracted
pneumonia and died. He
was buried beside Rose with
The Thinker as a headstone.
A headstone that so typified
the man, Rodin.

In "Castle Keep", Peter Falk is Sgt. Rossi.
He is asoldier. He says "Winning wars
is for children, generals and recruits.
k
Settle for a meal, a drink, a lay." He goes on:
"In North Africa I wasgoingtowinthewarinaday.
In Normandy it was going to b
e the next day, then the
nextweek. Later I figured it mighttake meayear. But
then I saw it running into centuries. I'm not crazy.
Screw the castle!" (
You've never seen a picture quite like this. I
s it a
war film -or an anti-war film ?
It dares to ask you to make up your mind about
prickly questions concerned with men and
women and moral values.
Some of its characters you will recognise as Hawks -
determined to fight the good fight-and some you will
discern as Doves. These are the ones who think that a
centuries-old castle full of art treasures is worth preserving,
even though it stands at a strategic crossroads.
