I.C. REACH FINAL
Gutteridge Cup: I.C. 18pts., C.E.M. 3pts.
By beating C.E.M. by 18
points to 3 points on Wed-
nesday 11th February, I.C.
1st X V reached their 3rd
Gutteridge Cup final in 5
years—this time, it is hoped,
to emerge as victors.
After a very hard fight
against Q.M.C. in the quar-
ter finals I.C. expected a
tough game — indeed the
noise and behaviour of some
of the Cemian supporters
(pissed again?) gave the
touchline the air (and
blood?) of a battle field!
However, on the field at
least, I.C. emerged as clear
cut winners even though the
score included 4 penalty
goals.
Ifor Rhys opened the
scoring by picking up a pass
from his fellow back row
forward Chris Wilson, to go
over to the corner. This was
fairly indicative of the way
the back row played toget-
her in a devastating unit,
both in attack and defence.
Swinnerton missed the con-
version but some minutes
later kicked a 40 yard pen-
alty to put I.C. 6-0 up.
The rucking of the I.C.
pack was really superb and
from one ruck on the C.E.M.
line, John Ballard received
the ball to crash his way
over. This remained the score
at half-time.
C.E.M. started throwing
the ball about somewhat
more in the second half and
pulled back to 9-3 with a
penalty goal. However I.C.
stuck to their task and
tackled ferociously—especi-
ally in the centre. Swinnerton
kicked three more penalty
goals—two of them mon-
strous kicks from around 50-
60 yards; he was only just
unlucky with several more.
These took all the fight out
of C.E.M. and I.C. finished
the game well on top.
The day's honours went to
I.C. as the better team but

surely the I.C. pack with
Terry Stephenson behind
them at scrum-half must pre-
sent a formidable combina-
tion for any side, so Wool-
wich in the final had better
take heed.
Free coaches will leave the
Union Arch at 12.30 p.m. on
Saturday, March 7th—this
is really one day when I.C.
need your support so come
and cheer (or drink, or sing
. . . . or do your thing!) at
Motspur Park a fortnight
Saturday, it'll be well worth
while.

An Action Shot from I.C.'s Gutteridge
Cup Match
Swimming: Victories for I.C.
I.C. had a comprehensive
victory in the U.L.U. swim-
ming championships, win-
ning eight out of the nine
men's events. The depth of
our strength was shown by
our having the maximum
number of 2 finalists in each
event, and by our taking first
and second places in four
events.
The 440 yd. freestyle was
effortlessly won by Roy Har-
ris with Peter McCartney
(I.C.) second. In the 110
yard freestyle later on the
placings reversed despite Mc-
Cartney showing his flair for
sportmanship, by pausing to
curse the starter before set-
ting off a yard behind every-
one else to found a new
championship record of 59.8
sec. Eric Thompson (I.C.) had
the misfortune to be pipped
for first place by a touch
twice, once in the 220
yd. butterfly. In his third final
in the 4 x 36 yd. indivi-
dual medley he again finished
in second place behind Har-
ris who cruised away to a
new championship record. In
the other men's individual
swimming event, the 110 yd.
backstroke, McCartney (I.C.)
was neck and neck with C.
Rogers (LLC), the holder,
throughout the race and fin-
ally was awarded the race
on the judges' decision, both
first and second recording
the same time. Bill Abel
(I.C.) won the men's diving
very effortlessly and ele-
gantly. The I.C. team's vic-
tories in the two relay races
involved quite a lot of effort
and very little elegance but
were nevertheless conclusive.
This year's win of the Col-
lege Cup—the fourth in suc-
cession for I.C.—was by far
the most crushing, due to the
outstanding performances of
Harris who won three events
and was second in one, Mc-
Cartney who did two per-
sonal best performances in
winning two events and com-
ing second in one, and
Thompson who was very
closely second in three events
and was unfortunate not to
win one.
Hockey 4-1 Win for I.C.W.A. in
Cup Semi-Final
The match started at a
very fast pace and within five
minutes, after some good
work by the I.C.W.A. for-
wards, Lynne Beynon scored
with an extremely good shot.
This effort was repeated al-
most straight away and so
with only ten minutes gone
I.C.W.A. led by 2-0. How-
ever, some of the impetus
was now lost and several
good chances were allowed
to go begging. Towards the
end of the first half slack
marking in the defence al-
lowed Westfield to score
their only goal of the match.
In fact this was the only real
chance that Westfield had in
the whole match.
In the second half I.C.W.A.
dominated the game and be-
gan to play with real assur-
ance. Both wings were used
much more and both were
able to put across some very
good centres, which were un-
fortunately wasted. However,
midway through the second
half Lynne Beynon comple-
ted her hat-trick with a well
taken goal, and towards the
end of the match Chris Cul-
shaw showed very good con-
trol when she eluded several
desperate tackles to com-
plete the scoring.
The match was played in a
very fine spirit and the stop-
ping and hitting of the
1.CW.A. team was of a very
high standard. While the
whole team played well it is
not invidious to single out
Lynne Beynon for her hat-
trick, Brenda Dilley and
Chris Culshaw, who both
played extremely well on the
wings, Mary Lewis who had
a fine game at centre-half,
and Janet Mansfield who
gave a very polished perfor-
mance at left back.
Provided that the team can
give a similar performance in
the final at Motspur Park on
28th February then the Pen-
ney Cup must return to L C .
Team: Jackie Buzzard;
Sue Edwards and Janet Man-
field; Hilary Hutchin, Mary
Lewis and Marilyn Diggens;
Brenda Dilley, Sue Thomp-
son, Lynne Beynon, Mysza
Paluch and Chris Culshaw.
The season is reaching an
exciting climax (though com-
plicated by an avalanche of
last minute cancellations and
rearrangements) as three of
the five teams are poised to
win their leagues.
The Men's I team is still
unbeaten with two out of ten
matches to play, and must
win Division I of the U.L.U.
League, unless both these
games are lost. This will re-
turn I.C. to the position of
continual dominance over
the U.L.U. League that it
occupied until two years ago.
Five of the games so far have
been won by the narrowest
possible margin (i.e. 5-4; de-
Badminton
finitely too close for com-
fort) and without the skill
and steadiness of Stu Donald
and George Georgiou in
particular, the outcome
would have been very dif-
ferent.
After a shaky start, the H I
team has recovered well, and
has now won all except their
first two matches. They are
at present top of U . L . U Divi-
sion IV, and must be in with
a good chance of taking
their division.
The mixed team, having
the services of three Mathe-
maticions, has a calculable
chance of winning the Mixed
First Division, though de-
pending on more 'ifs' and
'ands' than bear contempla-
tion. Two matches have been
lost, one against each of the
other two possible winners,
U . C and Q . M . C Providing
that the results of several
matches turn out favourably
(and Jupiter aligns with
Mars), then we have a fair
chance of winning on a set-
count.
The Men's II team have
won two out of five matches
played so far and should
maintain their place in the
middle of Division II.

Leeds Triumph in Hyde Park Relay
Last Saturday week I.C.
successfully organised their
Annual Hyde Park Relay. 73
teams from universities and
colleges throughout Britain,
and 7 teams from the Con-
tinent started the 6 x 3 mile
course.
At the end of the first leg,
Edinburgh University were
in the lead but dropped back
on legs 3 and 4 to eventually
finish fourth. Leeds Univer-
sity were outright winners,
covering the course in a new
record time of 85 min. 12 sec.
They took the lead from
Birmingham on the fourth
stage, maintained the lead on
the fifth and pulled away on
the last leg from Borough
Road College, who finished
second. Alsager College were
third.
Leuven University were the
first foreign team home, in
sixth position.
After the race, Lady Pen-
ney presented the Lady Rod-
erick Hill Cup to Leeds, and
the I.C.U. Cup to Borough
Road who were the first team
from a college of less than
500 male students to finish.
Results:—
Teams: 1st Leeds Univer-
sity, 85m., 12s.; 2nd Borough
Road College, 86m. 9s.; 3rd
Alsager College 86m. 39s.
Fastest laps: 1 M . Turner
(Queens, Cambridge) 13m.
28s.; 2 W. Mullet (Sussex)
13m. 36s.; 3 R. Goris (Leu-
ven) 13m. 40s.; 4 P. Rawns-
ley (Leeds) 13m. 41s.; 5 F.
Briscoe (Leeds) 13m. 42s.; 5
A . Blamire (Edinburgh) 13m.
42s.
Mike Turner's time is 4
sec. faster than the previous
lap record.
The I.C team finished in
9th position, rather lower
than we had hoped. The team
received an early setback,
with Nick Barton having to
cry off with a serious recur-
rence of knee trouble. There
is no reason for despondency
regarding I.C.'s performance,
however—every member of
the team recorded a personal
best for the course!
