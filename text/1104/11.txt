PAUL WELLER
Battersea Power Station
F
or a man who's over twice my
age, with a career spanning
three decades, t w o bands and
n o w a hugely successful solo
career, y o u ' d be forgiven for think-
ing that Paul Weller w o u l d be so
sick of touring that he wouldn't
bother any more. However y o u ' d
be wrong. The energy that o o z e d
through the punk, inspired rebel-
lious roots of The Jam which is still
flowing vigorously through the
veins of their old frontman, M r Paul
Weller.
Weller takes to the stage amid
rapturous applause, and rather
appropriately kicks off with The
Changingman, aptly describing his
musical genius that's more diverse
than a Cadbury's selection pack. In
line with the album, the concert
continues o n a electric guitar based
roller coaster ride, through Friday
Street, Science, Golden Sands and
occasionally nipping back to
Stanley Road or Wild Wood for a
tune or two. Sunflower arouses the
c r o w d and is followed by Brushed
which gets the mosh-heads at the
front jumping.
As they switch to the acoustic
part of the show, the spliffs c o m e
out. L a u n c h i n g into Driving
Nowhere, You do Something to Me
is quite literally breath-taking (pos-
sibly because you're trying not to
inhale any illegal substances!)
All this time a black cased piano
has been standing ominously at the
side of the stage and as Weller
approaches it, he is joined by an
impromptu string quartet and the
sound of Broken Stones fills the air.
Pink on White Walls raises the
t e m p o and it's back to the guitars
for Mermaids, one of the best off
the new album. The set winds
d o w n with an extended version of
Heavy Soul, Paul's personal
favourite and they troop off stage,
only to return for a phenomenal
Stanley Road. I Walk on Gilded
Splinters caps off a truly remark-
able concert.
Weller is an artist w h o is at his
best w h e n putting 100% effort into
his performance. With a sweat
patch on his back the size of Africa,
he knows the punters have had
value for m o n e y tonight. Proof
that, despite what N M E reckon, the
Modfather can still rock. C I

SUPERCHUNK
The Garage
G
runge is dead (isn't it?) It
seems such a long time
since Nirvana, Pearl Jam,
Alice in chains et al were the bands
of the moment. There no longer
seem to be any true masters of that
fine art form called feedback.
Ahhhh - feedback....It brings it all
back doesn't it! But can y o u name
a band still playing true grunge?
Even the remaining members of
Nirvana no longer have the grunge
muse, Grohl playing increasingly
more conventional rock (and very
g o o d it is too) a n d N o v o s e l i c
developing his strange and unique
form of 'lounge grunge'.
A n d so to the Garage in
Highbury. The first band I saw, hav-
ing missed the opening act, cer-
tainly tried to resurrect the genre
but seemed too y o u n g to have
lived through and understood the
grunge attitude. All the same, it
was g o o d to hear some g o o d ole
feedback; the last couple of songs
were actually fairly g o o d and it was
a shame we weren't told w h o the
band were.
M o v i n g swiftly on to band two
(Umbrella) and another beer
(Guinness), we had a complete
contrast to the previous band. They
were polished where the last band
were more ragged but Umbrella
looked far too old to be still doing
this touring lark. Initial hopes of
grunginess collapsed after the first
couple of songs and they lapsed
into a putrid pit of staid, lifeless
rock. Disappointing isn't a strong
enough w o r d for it... The person I
really felt sorry for was their
bespectacled lead guitarist w h o
kept trying to put some life into the
songs but was thwarted by the ter-
rible acoustics of the Garage; he
and was obviously playing with
great restraint, his frustration quite
evident. So far, so mediocre.
N o w for the main draw of the
evening - Superchunk - w h o ' d
c o m e r e c o m m e n d e d to me by one
of my e s t e e m e d colleagues as one
of the classic grunge bands and I
suppose they weren't bad, quite
g o o d in fact, but they weren't
grunge. A few of the older songs
s h o w e d that they used to be but
the newer songs we/e progressive-
ly s m o o t h e r , m o r e restrained,
more conventional and lacking in
originality. It s e e m s that
Superchunk, like bands such as the
Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam,
have obviously felt the need to
change. Understandable but I felt I
a little d i s a p p o i n t e d as s o m e
grunge w o u l d have p r o v i d e d a
refreshing change to the normal
indie and rock that dominates the
gig scene. Still, Superchunk were
fairly g o o d and are the first band
I've ever heard to actually get a
decent sound out of the Garage.
Unfortunately neither this not the
delicious female bassist (inciden-
tally, called Xena) m a n a g e d to
ignite the c r o w d or to dispel the
general aura of disappointment
inherent in an audience seemingly
c o m p o s e d of a large group of fans
of the band from "the g o o d old
days". Shame. H
