Moving out of hall for the first time?
Want to improve on last year's disaster?
Fear not, help is at hand! To compli-
ment the House of Horror competition,
here is a friendly guide on how to avoid
the pitfalls of flat hunting and a quick
advert for the places you can get help.
The essential tip has to be don't panic!
Mistakes are only really made when
people jump into arrangements they
later regret or sign contracts they can't
get out of.
Here are a few pointers:
If you want to start looking early, that's
OK, but be aware that prices will go up
for the summer and back down in the
autumn. Start by getting a general idea
of which estate agents are dealing with
your price range. Ask them what they
normally have to offer for students. An
IC list of agents will be available after
Accommodation Week, try to stick to
this.
When you start looking:
Do not believe agents who say they'll

Never visit a property by yourself, with or

reason you can look for as long as you
like and ask anything you like.
Do not sign anything unless you are
really sure you know what and why you
are signing, how long will you be
committed to it? e.t.c.
When you decide you've found
the right place:
You can put down a holding deposit to
the agent which stops him/her giving the
flat to anyone else. But, although the
good news is that this will be part of your
overall deposit not an extra payment,
the bad news is that you can't change
your mind without losing the deposit.
When signing, ideally you should have
at least one parent or someone who
knows what they're doing with you.
