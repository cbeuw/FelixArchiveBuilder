VICTORIAN FAIRY PAINTING
Royal Academy of Arts
T
his small magical mystery
exhibition invites the visitor
to penetrate the realms of
the enchanted kingdoms - or not
always so...
The passion for fairies and
specific interest in the supernatural,
which took hold of and animated
artists and writers from the early
19th century, is a specific British
extension of the Romantic move-
ment, which was surging through
Europe.
This passion contributed to
stimulate imaginative powers and
celebrate the untouched kingdom
of childhood, as well as to develop
a fascination for the occult.
The translation into English of
the Brothers G r i m m ' s a n d
Andersen's tales was of capital
influence, as was the strong p o p u -
larity of Shakespeare's dramas.
Fairy tales were read by all ages.
Dickens wrote in their defence that
"in a utilitarian age, of all times, it
is a matter of grave importance
that fairy tales should be respect-
ed".
There was an unprecedented
renewal of interest for fairy themes
in the dramatic arts, especially bal-
let. However, this ardour to depict
in the most credible ways these
fantastic worlds reveals the nostal-
gia of a world which is rapidly dis-
appearing and the fear associated
with the unknown. These paintings
are a protest against the defacing
generated by industrialisation,
aswell as a way of refusing the
square, scientific and rational view
and interpretation of the world.
They are an ultimate attempt at
allowing the possible existence of
an invisible world, at giving a little
space to its fragile creatures.
The works presented are peo-
pled with strange and surreal little
beings, birds, butterflies, trolls,
kobolds, nixies, pixies, w o o d
sprites, sylphs... absorbed in their
processions or ritual dances. There
are many scenes of evening gather-
ings in the forest, of voluptous
dances in the skies. Their worlds
are reproduced in minute details.
From many canvasses escapes a
magical glow, a unique lumines-
cence.
Sometimes, fairies appear in
the human meditation and dream,
but explicit connection is also sug-
gested between apparently drug-
induced nightmares and this other
world.
The most striking exhibition is
probably Joseph N o e l Patton's
painting of "The Quarrel of Oberon
and Titania", inspired from " A
M i d s u m m e r Night's Dream".
(A little revision of Shakespeare
: Oberon, traditional King of Fairies,
quarrels with his Queen Titania and
resolves to torment her because
she will not surrender to him a
changeling he desires to raise. He
gives her a dose of a magic aphro-
diasiac which enchants Titania with
Bottom until she has surrendered
what Oberon sought. However, at
that point, he feels sorry for her,
lifts his spell and reconciles with
her - as shown in the 2nd of
Patton's paintings on this theme).
The Scottish artists was associ-
ated with the Pre-Raphaelites,
which indeed reflects in his meticu-
lous attention to detail. The paint-
ing is fascinating in its intricacy.
O n e can spend hours looking at it -
discovering something new each
minute. Rarely have you been given
such an invitaition to penetrate a
painting.
There are numerous secondary
scenes taking place around the
main one, many of which are very
erotic.
For the Victorian period, this
canvass is indeed rather explicit. In
many others, erotism is present as
an undercurrent, such as in Thomas
Heatherley's "Golden Age", always
trying to outsmart the moral and
religious interdicts of the age.
The nature of fairy painting
changed after 1880, the represen-
tation of great Shakesperian char-
acters gave way to more generic
fairies, to the personification of
seasons and stars.
However, not all displays are of
pure light and angelic sweetness.
There is a darker side to this world.
Some of John Anster Fitzgerald's
characters s e e m truly evil, and
directly inspired from Jerome
Bosch's monsters. There, fairies do
die and carry grief. But it is through
Richard Dadd that this representa-
tion is led to its climax. A n atmos-
phere of threat and fear haunts
such works as "The Fairy Feller's
Master Stroke".
The enthusiasm for fairy paint-
ing was brutally and rather tragical-
ly ended with the beginning of
World War One. The horrors that
followed were such that they ban-
ished to childhood what had been
d e e m e d , for a time, suitable for the
adult's world.

[PAINTING]

I
like being a quasi arts journalist.
Even though few people actual-
ly read my stuff, it's worth it
just for the perks of the job. O n e of
these has to be cycling through the
rain to M a i d a Vale, knowing that
your carefully crafted hairstyle has
been flattened and that your mas-
cara is now on your cheeks, then
arriving at the pristine, clinical
whiteness of the Saatchi Gallery to
be greeted by a bunch of i m m a c u -
lately dressed real arts journalists is
always fun.
So it was a nice change to go
into a terribly run d o w n basement
gallery, where the lights weren't
working, and the pervading impres-
sion was of rising d a m p . This is the
Basement Gallery, Boundary Road,
M a i d a Vale. 1 was handed a flyer
for this exhibition at random, and
after embarrassing myself in front
of the m a s s e d art-people of
London, I thought this would make
a nice change. It was.
The exhibition is a hundred
miles from the flat grace of Alex
Katz's work, which is not to say
that it is bad. It's not, it's just dif-
ferent. Brendon Lyons is a youngish
artist from Liverpool, w h o graduat-
ed from Arts S c h o o l eighteen
months ago. His work is very solid,
it's painting m a d e from paint.
Really paint. H e constructs shapes
from solid paint. Examples of his
work includes paint hooks made
from paint. These were positioned
on the walls at the distance where
you would expect to see paintings.
But the hooks themselves are the
paintings. They look as if they could
support a painting, but they can't.
Obviously. They're made of paint.
His work is intended to fool the
brain, by showing something that
the eyes reject. Another painting is
a still life, a collection of objects on
white stands. You can walk around
the painting, look at it from many
different angles, but it is still a still
life. Again, this is made from solid
paint. But it's a painting. Got that?
Brendon was very keen to point
this out to me, time and again. It
really is the most important part of
the exhibition. His work is very
g o o d . Forget what 1 generally write
about modern art, this is really
g o o d . Can we have this in the Ante
R o o m Gallery, please?
