DISTINCTIVE SOUND OF HOUSE
23 January 1998
Vol.2. • • • • 1 / 2
T
he ability of a DJ, often
depends on weather they can
make 12 tunes(ish) converge
into what seems like an hour long
journey. Unfortunately with DJ'ing
becoming everyone's favourite past-
time, many forget this. There are
those into the scene w h o play out
and aim t o d o as many events in a
night as possible.
Nowadays, with the amount of
compilations coming out, there's lit-
tle or no chance of finding a t o p
quality house compilation. That's
why when I first heard this I had t o
listen to it again a n d again. The
Distinctive Sound O f House Vol.2 is
an outstanding 2 x C D package
which covers all genres of what used
to be called House.
C D 1 . Concentrates o n the
bassier, lighter sounds of both UK
and "speed" Garage, with Housey
more familiar beats coming a little
later. Huff ' n ' Puff's Help M e M a k e
It, along with Din D a D a by Kevin
Aviance starts the epic combination,
funky Garage beats with catchy
lyrics. The bassline soon comes in,
and the beats continue to roll on in
the form of the Headcrash's Give It
To M e , a n d Hyper's G o Go, both
absolutely banging tunes, well worth
a place on this C D .
Then Dj Supreme Tha Wildstyle
is probably the weakest tune o n
here, but it dose what is needed to
change the flavour from Garage to
House. The House featured here is
not the cheesey Pete (can't be both-
ered (or just can't) mix) Tong, radio
1 style, but the form which house
took up before commercialism.
Adeva's Don't think about it gets
played twice, with the N u Birth
Vocal mix being the harder, reflect-
ing the change of pace.
C D 2 . Carries on where the previ-
ous hour left off, with P . O . W by
Mike Crawley. The first few tunes on
this C D have a fair amount of catchy
lyrical content which combines with
the familiar hard house beats. Hot
Shot 9 7 ' by Karen Young has an old
skool feel to it, and is probably the
last breather you'll get before the
final half hour kicks in with an extrav-
aganza of fast, hard, house beats.
Walk with m e by Helicopter com-
bines a massive breakdown with
over seven minutes of pure sex, in
musical terms of course.
All in all this compilation con-
tains 24 top quality tunes, truly cap-
turing what is happening in club land
all expertly &. seamless mixed
together by Richard Ford, a man
w h o been o n the scene for longer
than most of us new it existed.
Those lovely people at Phuture
Trax have some copies of the com-
pilation & some T-shirts to give
away, can't be bad.
The three first people to drop
name and contact no into Felix
office will win. Chris.
