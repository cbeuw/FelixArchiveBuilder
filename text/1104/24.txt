The game started strangely for the
fourths- they were actually playing
some g o o d passing football but
failed to score. S o m e stupid play
by the defence- Paul must have
been thinking of his failures at the
'Theatre' the night before a n d A n d y
was playing with his, already
strained banjo. They scored , but it
wasn't long before w e d e c i d e d to
go back to our best skills a n d get
"stuck i n " . Dazzler "Babyface"
Boland finishing off a shit move
from 25 yards and then went off at
half time to be breast f e d . The
fourths c a m e out in the second
half with only one thing o n their
mind, so Swifty told us to stop
thinking about sex and concentrate
on the game. This w e d i d equalis-
ing through a fine move o n the left
and with the touch of the ground
hog Phaedon scored a great goal.
The midfield all battled well a n d in
the last t w o minutes the fourths
got the lucky break they deserved,
dazzler scoring with a clinical finish
from just inside the box. Special
mention must g o to S - T - U w h o
played an excellent second half
and M o r g a n Roy Hill w h o has
come out of the desert a n d admit-
ted his homosexuality. Finally
cheers to the second team for
their support at the e n d of a great
match.

The first match of the second term
has always had a lot in c o m m o n
with the dreadful hangover experi-
enced o n N e w Year's Day. This
game was no different from previ-
ous years as Imperial, though
occasionally looking g o o d when
going forward, looked weak at the
back. Midfielders like Foulstone
and Pratt were clearly lacking
match fitness. Ricky Gibson was
recalled as T i p p a y a w o n g a n d
M a r c o s were missing, while cap-
tain Chris Soberg put in a terrible
performance of which The Duke of
Prague would be truly ashamed.
Indeed his performance was so
poor that he substituted himself
midway through the 2 n d half, then
laid most of the blame o n Patsy
Green, a 3rd year chemistry U G ,
who had refused to let Psycho
drink champagne out of her shoe
on the night prior to the game.
Q M W , the League leaders,
shocked the hosts as they took the
lead in the first minute of the
game. Imperial showed character,
however, a n d equalised w h e n
Stewart rose to meet Brayn's left
wing cross. IC then took the lead
when Brayn coolly slotted the ball
into the t o p left hand corner.
Q M W were given a lifeline
after Foulstone's fowl gave them a
penalty, then went 3-2 up just
before half-time after 'keeper
Keane misjudged a corner. H o p e s
of a come-back were dashed when
Q M W got a fourth at the start of
the half, even though Pratt pulled
one back. Italian whizz-kid Roberto
replaced Gibson, and was given a
harsh introduction to the English
game as he was brutally brought
d o w n twice. Eventually A m o pulled
one back. Towards the e n d ,
German Shanidze was sent off for
the most blatant foul ever seen at
Harlington.
Following this set-back it is bet-
ter to read the League table upside
d o w n as far as Imperial are con-
c e r n e d . Indeed it's a bit like
Prague's situation under German
terror during W W II. But, just as
the Allies turned the tide and car-
p e t - b o m b e d Dresden there are
positive signs, too. Next month the
Firsts play U M D S in the C u p semi-
final as well as taking on U E A in
BUSA. Like the Germans, they shall
be begging for mercy.

Hullo everyone.
I would like to thank all those
who expressed dismay at the
death of S i m o n "the people's
sports editor". It warms m y heart
to see h o w the nation has united
in a display of the grief over this
tragic loss.
Across the country, thousands
are queueing to sign books of
condolence and leave flowers and
cheap trinkets at the many Simon
Shrines. T o c o m m e m o r a t e his
remarkable life, the band Black
Lace (close friends of Simon) are
releasing A g a d o o '98 featuring the
modified chorus:
Simon D . D . D.
He was w o u n d e d fatally.
Simon D. D. D .
N o w he's in the cemetery.
All profits go to the Simon fund
(proprietor J. Thome), order yours
now!
As for m y tribute to h i m ,
Simon w o r k e d ceaselessly to d i g
up stories for the Felix sports
page. H e truly was our Prince of
Spades.
The fascinating story of
Simon's life is d o c u m e n t e d in my
book Simon - His True Story
(unlike all the other Simon books
which are complete fabrications
and not worth the paper they're
written on).

PS It is m y pleasure to introduce
my n e w collaborator Niall Darwin.
I tried to pass o n m y extensive
knowledge to h i m but it seems he
is already well versed in the art of
tea making.
New Formula 1
contender revealed.
Schumacher
Having g a w p e d &. gasped at the
feats performed by t w o "Cirque de
Soleil" contortionists 1 was n o w
being amazed at the timing &. acro-
batic skills of their many trampolin-
ists. Performing o n an " X " shaped
trampoline sunk into the Albert
Hall's stage they somersaulted &.
flick-flacked around, over &. under
each other at ridiculous speed.
C o m e the end of the perfor-
mance I a m suddenly reminded
what I came here for as a huge
screen drops d o w n out of the ceil-
ing &v a video of yellow racing cars
screaming around a circuit starts
playing. I'm here to see the launch
of Jordan's attack o n the 1998
Formula 1 World Championship.
Following a short animation intro-
ducing their dramatic n e w w a s p
logo, the new car is dropped out of
the rafters &. stage hands g o to
work r e m o v i n g its s u p p o r t i n g
chains. D a m o n Hill &. Ralf
Schumacher (Michael's younger
brother) then appear & start posing
with the car for the paparazzi, smil-
ing broadly.
Later, in the press conference,
whizzes about in the new Jordan.
the driver's smiles are still present
as they answer questions about the
new car & their chances of winning
in it. They appear fairly confident
of bringing the team its first ever FI
win this season.
The car they hope will bring
them these race wins outwardly
seems little different to last year's
design despite rule changes result-
ing in less effective wings &. tyres.
The most obvious difference is
their new logo replacing the snake
of last year. Under the skin they
have an entirely different engine, a
M u g e n - H o n d a , changed from last
year's Peugeot. This could prove a
mixed blessing, the deciding factor
being whether the engine is mostly
M u g e n or mostly H o n d a .
If championships were decided
by launch parties then Jordan
would have this year's sewn up,
with bonus points for omitting the
Spice Girls. Unfortunately they
aren't, but with the help of
Damon's experience look out for
Jordan winning a couple of races
this year.
Niall.
