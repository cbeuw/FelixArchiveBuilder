Monday night saw yet another
drugs related incident in Linstead
Hall. At around midnight security
guards were alerted after a smoke
alarm was activated in a stu-
dent's room.
Felix was told that security
entered the r o o m and found what
was later claimed by security to be
cannabis. Security was also alleged
to have had trouble opening the
door, a n d a c c u s e d the r o o m ' s
occupants of barricading the
entrance. According to one of the
students there were six people in
the room at the time, including one
re-app and one non-Imperial stu-
dent. The students neither con-
firmed nor denied that they were
smoking cannabis - two of them
have also claimed that they were
too drunk to notice what was going
on. After entering the r o o m , the
guards noticed the smell of
cannabis, although the students
claim that they didn't notice for "a
couple of minutes". O n e of the stu-
dents indignantly c o m p l a i n e d that
he were subjected to an intrusive
and intimate search, to which he
had not given consent. Keith
Reynolds, Imperial College's Head
of Security confirmed that a guard
must obtain consent in such a situ-
ation. All students were searched,
with p r o t o c o l forcing a female
m e m b e r of security staff being
brought over to assist with a sus-
pected w o m a n . O n e of those pre-
sent alleged no evidence was found
on any suspect, although one of the
security staff found minute traces
of what was claimed to be cannabis
in a "mix" with tobacco which had
been swept to the floor. The stu-
dents have been told to expect a
disciplinary hearing, although the
charges against them have yet to be
revealed. IC Security said that they
were unable to c o m m e n t further on
the matter, saying that the incident
was n o w being looked into by col-
lege.
This is the second time in a
month that Linstead residents have
been involved in a drugs scandal.
December saw two students fined
Â£ 7 5 each for smoking cannabis.
W h e n asked if he was alarmed at
the apparent increase in drug abuse
within Linstead, the Assistant
W a r d e n , M r . Richard Hamilton,
declined to comment, stating only
that "the law is the law".

The government of Imperial is to
undergo a radical shake-up next
term under plans announced by
the governing body.
For the first time ever student
representatives will be given a vote
at the highest levels of College
administration, bringing IC in line
with most other universities in the
UK, a m o v e d e s c r i b e d by ICU
President Andy H e e p s as "Excellent
news".
The sovereign body of College
will become the "Imperial Court", a
much larger version of the present
Governing Body, which will meet
once a year (as o p p o s e d to the
present six). Included in the m e m -
bership of this body will be seven
voting members from ICU - the
President and Deputy Presidents of
the Union, and the four Constituent
College Union Presidents.
M o s t decisions will then be
devolved d o w n to the much small-
er "Imperial Council", which would
be equivalent to the present IC
Executive. Again, this will contain
students as voting members for the
first time, which will allow the two
representatives - the ICU President
and DP(F&5) - to table motions and
speak o n all issues (although only
the President will have a vote).
Finally, the "Imperial Senate"
will replace the Board of Studies,
continuing to include the President
and t w o other students amongst
its number.

O n the w e e k e n d of 10 and 1 1
January, 120 members of the col-
lege were anonymously sent mali-
cious chain e-mail. The message,
entitled 'Letter of Fate' told recipi-
ents to forward the e-mail on to
five others within three days to
avoid bad luck, a c o m m o n ploy
used by internet 'spammers' to
spread junk mail. Prof. R. J.
Hynds, H e a d of the Centre for
C o m p u t i n g Services, explained
that most of the recipients' e-mail
addresses c o u l d have been
extracted from legitimate mailing
lists m a n a g e d by the C C S .
Investigating the logs of electron-
ic requests for the addresses and
collaborating with A O L , the C C S
have managed to narrow d o w n
this spammer to only a few sus-
pects. The C C S , collaborating with
U K E R N A , w h o manages links
between UK university networks,
have since restricted the requests
for addresses to combat future
malicious mailers.

A c a d e m i c salaries have hit an
18-year low, according to the
A s s o c i a t i o n of University
Teachers. In a speech yesterday
AUT President Penny Holloway
said that the last three years had
seen inflation go up by 9.2% but
Higher Education staff wages
increased by only 8.7%. "Nowhere
else in the U K e c o n o m y ... has
suffered a more consistent d o w n -
w a r d pressure o n costs," she
a d d e d . She cited the increased
staff workload, such as adminis-
tering tuition fees, encouraging
wider access to HE, and the con-
tinuing cuts that the sector has
had to face. Laura Barker,
Geology Department librarian and
a member of the A U T National
Executive, a d d e d , "The level of
salaries are scandalous... there's
been a massive increase in pro-
ductivity. There does seem to be
a blinding lack of appreciation of
education, education and educa-
tion."
