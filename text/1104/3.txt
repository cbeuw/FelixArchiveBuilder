The next stage in Imperial's
"Campus Renaissance" has n o w
begun, with the refurbishment of
the college power-plant getting
underway. The four existing heavy
oil burners, which are reaching the
end of their economic lifetime, will
be replaced with t w o gas fired
engines which will produce both
heat and power. The new plant
should be more environmentally
friendly than conventional genera-
tors, as all waste heat will be recy-
cled. Emissions of carbon dioxide
should fall by 7 5 0 0 tonnes per
year.
To maintain the s u p p l y of
steam to 1C, the first stage of the
project is the construction of a
temporary boiler house o n Dalby
Court. This plant will be gas-fired,
and requires a new gas main to be
laid. O n c e operational, at the end
of M a r c h , the existing boiler house
located beneath the basements of
the Electrical Engineering depart-
ment will be disconnected and
d i s m a n t l e d , and w o r k o n the
installation of the new boilers will
begin. Speaking to Felix, Ron
Jeeves, the project manager, said
that he hopes the project will be
completed by the end of 1999,
allowing the new plant to become
operational for the millennia.
M r Jeeves estimated the total
cost of the project at £ 8 million,
which should be repaid "over eight
or nine years". Considering the
estimated thirty year life for the
new engines, he felt that the pro-
ject represented a sound e c o n o m -
ic and environmental move.

The recent turbulence in South
East Asian economies could force
a decline in applications to
British Universities from
Overseas students.
As a whole, the UK stands to
lose £ 3 0 0 million if applications fall
as predicted.
Malaysian authorities have
warned that up to 80% of students
may now study locally instead of
abroad. The average d r o p is
expected to be around 40%. M a n y
universities are expected to shift
their recruitment efforts to the
Mediterranean, South Africa and
Eastern Asia to make up the deficit.
Others, such as Warwick, have set
up schemes to give financial aid to
overseas students wishing to study
here.
Despite fears over s o m e
Eastern economies, applications
from Singapore and H o n g Kong are
expected to continue to rise at a
steady rate. This was backed by
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister,
Tony Tan, w h o pledged ongoing
support for those wishing to study
abroad.
It is far to early to have any
accurate idea of the number of
applications this year, but many
universities could find a gap in their
income to the tune of millions of
pounds.

The mystique of the Russell
Croup has recently been dispelled
by a leaked letter to the Secretary
of State.
With the group's pro-fees
objectives clearly exposed various
student bodies are organising
opposing initiatives in an attempt
to keep higher education accessi-
ble.
The Russell Group, similar to
the American Ivy League, consists
of 17 of Britain's most prestigious
Higher Education Institutions repre-
sented by their Rectors and Vice-
Chancellors. The group, w h i c h
includes universities such as
Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and
Imperial, has been shrouded in
secrecy and consequently attracted
the attention of related student
unions. The Group was formed in
1994 to prioritise and concentrate
research efforts amongst institu-
tions; the discussions have subse-
quently progressed to the issue of
'top-up' fees which entrants would
need to pay for the privilege of hav-
ing what is deemed to be a better
standard of education by attending
a Russell Group university.
Despite the fact that many
Rectors and Vice-Chancellors have
consistently denied the existence of
the group, a shadow group was
formed to oppose the top-up fees.
This c o m m i t t e e , k n o w n as the
'Aldwych Group' is made up of the
presidents of student unions, U L U
and the N U S . It had been set up in
order to directly counter the Russell
Group's pursuit of top-up fees and
is leading the battle with positive
action. The Group also plan to high-
light the threat of top-up fees more
openly, thus highlighing the exis-
tence of the Russell Group.
The controversy is currently
centred around the 'Teaching and
Higher Education' bill that Labour
will introduce to Parliament on the
26 January. It currently contains a
clause that prevents universities
from any financial gain as a result of
charging higher fees than the pro-
p o s e d Government levels. The
Russell Group are pressing for an
a m e n d m e n t that w o u l d enable
them to profit from whatever fees
they decide u p o n . . Sir Colin
Campbell, Vice-Chancellor of
Nottingham University, wrote to
the Secretary of State on behalf of
all the Russell Group, describing the
top-up fees as a necessary aid in
the preservation of autonomy and
standards in UK higher education.
China was cited as an example
where paying fees privately was
standard; "Only substantial increas-
es in public funding can avert such
a scenario here unless quality is to
be rapidly and irretrievably d a m -
aged". The letter alluded to a meet-
ing between the Department of
Education and the Russell Group,
and confirms the existence and the
actions of the Russell Group.
In o p p o s i t i o n , the A l d w y c h
Group are also formalising and
establishing a secretariat in the U L U
building. They are planning to book
a room in the House of Lords, invit-
ing M P s and Lords to lobby for the
continuance of the current clause in
the higher education bill. Siva
Ganeshanandan, treasurer of the
Aldwych Group, explained how the
Russell Group were now "coming
out of the woodwork" compelling
many institutions to fight for an
education "without financial restric-
tions". The N U S refuse to condemn
the Russell Group outright but sup-
ported actions of the A l d w y c h
Group w h e n they take effective
action against fees.
Andy Heeps, ICU President and
active m e m b e r of the Aldwych
Group, explained how the top-up
system could lead to the develop-
ment of an elitist culture within
Higher Education. He saw the cur-
rent situation at Oxbridge where
50% of students are from private
schools as a depiction of what
could occur in the Russell Group
Universities. H e predicted top-up
fees would place all universities in a
'win-win' situation where the m e m -
bers of the Russell Group would
receive all top-up fees (which is not
the case with Labour's tuition fees)
and the "lesser, newer universities"
would benefit as a result of applica-
tions from top students that could
not afford to enter the Russell
Group. M r Heeps stated it would
only be the students that lost out
even with the "bursaries and schol-
arships" suggested by Sir Campbell
in his letter, and denounced top-up
fees as "detrimental to Higher
Education in this country".
