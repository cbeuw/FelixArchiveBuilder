L A Z Y M O R E L I K E
What are you doing here? N o , real-
ly, ask yourself "why a m I at
Imperial College?" O d d s o n the
only reasons y o u can think of are:
a) I've started, s o I'll finish.
b) I want a degree / PhD.
c) I've nothing better t o do.
It's simply the done thing t o apply
to university. At seventeen, getting
a job is a frightening prospect while
another three or more years in
closeted academia could be fun,
and could land you with a highly
paid job at the end of it. So here we
are, living off our parents and the
taxpayer's money, pissing u p the
wall as much of it as possible with-
out jeopardising our o w n program
of self-improvment a n d lucrative
job prospects. Even if you're head-
ed for the more alturistic pursuits
of medicine or research, the funda-
mental a i m is self improvement.
Have you ever stopped to consider
how selfish this is?
Now, stop and ask youself the
question "Is Imperial College
ideal?" If your answer is "yes", it
may be time t o pay a visit to the
friendly health centre psychiatrist.
If it's "no", then why aren't you
doing something about it?
O n M o n d a y , nomination
papers for the ICU sabbatical elec-
tions will appear o n the notice
board opposite the union offices.
This initiates the annual campus-
wide elections to decide w h o will
have the combined privaledge and
curse of running the union next
year. There are four positions avail-
able; the president, two deputies
(one responsible for the finances
and services, one for the clubs and
societies) and, listed last as always,
the editor of Felix. Y O U can stand
for these positions. Try to stop and
think about that; what would it be
like to actually d o these jobs?
Sabbatical positions should not
however b e c o n s i d e r e d as job
opportunities - they are rather a
chance t o break your selfish and
uncaring habits, a n d make a real
positive contribution t o the life of
students at Imperial College and
even elsewhere. S o , are you really
in such a hurry t o get that big-
money city job and flash car that
you can't s p e n d a year doing
something genuinely valuable and
worthwhile? You can't? S o d you,
then.
If you are considering standing,
as I hope you are, please remem-
ber that the current sabbaticals
(Andy Heeps (President), Rob Clark
(DP FSS), Charlie Joynt (DP C&S)
and Jeremy Thomson (Felix Ed)) are
more that happy to offer good and
bad advice about the positions. Do
talk to them.
