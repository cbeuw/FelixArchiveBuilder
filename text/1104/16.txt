Quite possibly
the daftest film
of all time
This is the film everybody is talk-
ing about (well, apart f r o m
Titanic). The artist formerly known
as Marky M a r k stars alongside
Burt Reynolds in a sharp look at
the seventies p o r n industry.
Fortunately, the emphasis is on
the dysfunctional characters
involved rather than the problem
of censorship which has already
been covered in Larry Flynt. It
shows the lengths desperate
people will g o to in pursuit of
s t a r d o m a n d the tragic
consequences that so often await
those w h o fail.
There are five pairs of tickets
to be w o n as well as exclusive
Boogie Nights mugs and pens.
These prizes will be given to the
first five people w h o c o m e into
the Felix office today and tell us:
Which film starred Burt
Reynolds as a trucker pursued
by pesky cops?.

Time is running out to see one of
the most over-the-top effects-
laden films of all time. Paul
Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is
pure entertainment with a
negligible plot, more evil alien
bugs than y o u can squirt insect-
repellent at and no famous leads
to get in the way of the fun.
The O d e o n Kensington is
giving y o u one last chance to see
the great film this week, and we
have five pairs of tickets for the
late-night screenings tonight and
B
ased on Thomas Hardy's
novel, M i c h a e l Winter-
bottom's film tells the tragic
story of stonemason Jude Fawley,
who tries to pursue his dream of
attending university and escaping
his mundane rural life. Despite
omitting the final and bleakest
section of the novel this film still
does not score highly on the feel-
g o o d scale.
The film boasts brilliant
performances from Christopher
Eccleston (Shallow Crave) and
especially Kate Winslet (Titanic),
who once again demonstrates her
ability to act in a variety of roles.
This c o m b i n e s with w e l l - p a c e d
direction to create yet another
quality adaptation of a classic
novel. D

answer to the following simple
question:
Which classic Paul Verhoeven
film featured the line "You have
twenty seconds to comply"?

correct answer will also w i n a

Pierce Brosnan - The New
Unauthorised Biography
Available n o w at £ 5 . 9 9
No stars
T
here are two thoughts that
spring to mind when one is
contemplating an "unautho-
rised" biography. The first is plenty
of dirt a n d juicy g o s s i p . The
second is that it's so bad that the
subject didn't want anything to d o
with it.
It doesn't take long to place
this in the second category. The
author begins with a nauseatingly
sycophantic description of the
Leicester Square premiere of
Coldeneye and manages to irrele-
vantly include how m u c h more
regal Brosnan is than the future
King of England. The narrative
remains at this level throughout.
The writing is reminiscent of pre-
GCSE essays w h e n one is still
learning to master onomatopoeias
and simile. To be fair a lot of
information has been collected but
most of it is based on remarks
made by neighbours, distant family
and n u m e r o u s magazine and
newspaper reviews.
A picture of Brosnan does
slowly evolve and for somebody
who felt abandoned by his parents
and picked o n at school for being a
tall skinny runt, he has done quite
well for himself. However, one
cannot help but feel that any valid
biography should include a sub-
stantial input from the subject him-
self. This book is only likely to
appeal to a love-struck fan and I
defy anybody else to be able to
read it. •

o u t e d as Friends meets
Swingers, this film follows
the d e v e l o p i n g relation-
ships of t w o lifelong friends.
H e c h e has a fiancee but still
fantasises about sex with other
m e n . Keener is in a worse situa-
tion still - even the ugly bloke
from the local video store has
d u m p e d her and she's worried
that her friend will forget her
once the w e d d i n g day arrives.
This is an observant but gentle
film with likable characters. There
are one or t w o interesting sub-
plots a l o n g the w a y but the
happy ending is never really in
doubt. This video is thus only
worth buying if y o u are fascinated
by insecure females and their
relationships. I I
