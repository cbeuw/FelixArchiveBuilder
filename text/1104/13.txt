THE HIGH LLAMAS
Cold And Bouncy
The Llamas: Sorry, hut I just
don't understand.
I
've never had a lot of time for
the High Llamas since they
remixed a favourite B o o
Radleys s o n g Find the Answer
Within a few years ago. The 'remix'
consisted wholly of slowing the
s o n g d o w n a little, adding some
irritating dog-whistle style organ
over the top and altering Sice's
voice so that he ended up sound-
ing as if he was singing d o w n a
scaffold tube.
But, like everyone else, once I
heard the single Tilting Windmills
on the radio a dozen times I ended
up thinking ' H m m m , that's O K , 1
quite like that1
, rather like someone
listening to a new Beautiful South
song might. Next thing I know, I've
got sixteen tracks to write intelli-
gently about. Here we go then with
the compulsory trivia section:
By m y count, Cold and Bouncy
brings the Llama-factor up to six
albums, not including Sean
O'Hagan's solo effort The High
Llamas (I), the handful of
Microdisney jobs or those rather
half-arsed mini albums that bands
seem to love so much. A n d yes,
five points for recognising Sean
O'Hagan as the keyboard player on
m a n y of the finest Stereolab
albums.
Sadly, though, it's easy to lose
count. After all, how d o y o u know
which record is playing in the lift in
Kwiksave on a particular day? What
can I mean with that backhanded
insult? Well, simply that this album
sounds m u c h like the others; sev-
enty-four minutes of background
music. It's pleasant, well-produced,
easy on the ear, a little trippy even,
but will all the bumps and edges
s m o o t h e d out 1 just can't seem to
get enthusiastic, as y o u can proba-
bly tell from this incoherent review.
So, before this piece totally falls to
pieces in my hands, let's have a
look at the tracks:
The Llamas kick off with a
rather nice little ditty Twisto Teck,
which lasting just forty-five sec-
onds, is quite bearable. They
launch straight into The Sun Beats
Down, a gentle track with a soft
beat, inoffensive backing chords,
x y l o p h o n e s and strange bubbly
noises that s o u n d like a b o n g
played through a M o o g .
Occasionally, some vocals break in,
followed by a strings break, as
night follows day. It's hard to say
exactly when track two ended and
three begun, but before y o u know
it Tilting Windmills is half way
through, and it is the liveliest track
on the album. Songs five to ten
glide by while y o u are making your-
self quick c u p p a , with o n l y
Showstop Hip Hop living up to its
name, at first anyway. Jolly jingle
bells accompany a relaxed reggae
beat, which speeds up to a break
and then it's back to - can y o u
guess? Inoffensive backing chords,
x y l o p h o n e s a n d strange bubbly
noises...
If you're a Llamas fan, I've prob-
ably irritated y o u so m u c h by n o w
that you'll buy the record out of
spite. Otherwise, save your money
by buying the single and playing it
repeatedly. ' M u s i c that is at once
both easy on the ear and weighted
with a depth that repays constant
listening', claims their biography. I
agree with the first part. H

FIVE

T
he problem with this album is
that the fans will have the
majority of the songs, and
the uniniated won't enjoy this at
all. It's got s o m e great stuff on it,
especially Julianne and Song for
the Dumped, but as live albums
go, it's fairly average. It can't c o m -
pare to Ben Folds Five, the first
album, or to Whatever and Ever,
Amen, but then, I never expected
it to. I wasn't expecting the sheer
rubbish of For Those of Ya'll Who
Wear Fannie Packs, which appar-
ently is a Beastie Boys piss-take,
but quite frankly, it's not big, it's
not clever and it's certainly not
funny. Before I listened to this
album, I read the. Independent's
review, which said that Ben Fold's
Five were a band completely with-
out soul. This was after having lis-
tened to the sheer beauty of
Philosophy a n d Alice Childress.
That's a very harsh view, and also
an unfair one. This album isn't a
g o o d representation of their work,
but it'll d o until they release a new
one. It w o u l d get five stars,
because I love them, despite their
photos, except 1 hate that Beasties
Boys song. H

T
he Seventies. What an era.
Some will ask w h y fashion
took the course it d i d back in
the days of the sideburn. W h y were
people a l l o w e d to wear bright
green satin shirts along with brown
trousers that flared over twenty
inches? A n d not only that, w h y
were they allowed to wear ties that
could have wallpapered a small
room along with mohair jackets
that looked as though the wearer
had a V a n de Graaf generator
tucked underneath? The answers to
these questions are academic real-
ly but whatever they did a bit w r o n g
with their fashion, they never did it
with their music. I mean, this was
the decade of bands like Funkadelic
(space age sets and, again, stupid
clothes), Kool and the Gang (vocals
that resembled s o m e o n e orgas-
ming - all before nosediving into
the horrible quagmire that was the
eighties) a n d H o t C h o c o l a t e
(mmm, y o u know what 1 mean...).
Well, this album doesn't contain
any of those names and prefers to
stay with the more popular and
typically Fame-esque songs. It
does, however, contain classics
such as Best Of My Love by The
Emotions, Ain't No Stoppin' Us
Now and the Beach Boys' G o d
Only Knows, described once by
John Lennon as the nicest song
ever written. There's also a helping
of s o m e quirky p o p too with the
likes of Brand New Key by Melanie,
a strange little track which has
something to d o with girls on roller-
skates. But it's not all brilliant as it
gets into an early eighties phase
near the end with songs like Livin'
Thing by E L O . Eeurghl!
Disgust aside, this album is a
pretty g o o d collection of some of
the (camp) best of the '70s...viva
disco! CI
