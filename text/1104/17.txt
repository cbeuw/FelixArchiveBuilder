THE GOONS - THE STORY
Sir Harry Seacombe, Eric Sykes, Edited by Norma Fames
T
he G o o n s first went o n air
as "The Crazy People" in
M a y 1951. Having met in
a pub in the early post war years,
Milligan, S e a c o m b e , M i c h a e l
Bentine and the landlord Jimmy
Grafton met and began a "rasping,
squealing, giggling, snorting period
of lunacy" which continued unabat-
ed until 1960. They brought the
most absurd anarchic c o m e d y ever
Two men and a nutcase
heard to a stolid, traditional radio
audience, and generations discover
afresh their brilliant legacy. The
book follows their history and fea-
tures a unique collection of
Milligan's personal memorablia and
photographs, as well as contribu-
tions from G o o n co-writer Sykes,
and several celebrated fans. It is
extraordinarily well researched,
with superb source material and
hundreds of personal photographs.
The many sketches transcribe well,
but y o u are left feeling a little seg-
regated from the writers, as if it
were a private conversation t o
which y o u are not party. The writ-
ing tends to be uneven and frag-
mented with pointless trivia a n d
attention to detail too overworked
for anyone but the most obsessed
fan. There is inherently no self crit-
icism, making this seem a real
backslapper of a book, with no
input from outside the tight circle
of friends a n d partners w h i c h
defined the Goons phenomenon.
An ideal book for the devout, dare 1
say trainspotting fan, but contain-
ing little of worth for the casual
reader and occasionally downright
dull. The Goons were a blast of
fresh air for radio, for c o m e d y .
M o r c a m b e a n d W i s e , M o n t y
Python and Reeves and M o r t i m e r
share The Goons in their comic
ancestry; this slightly dreary book
does them little justice. A shame
really, and if 1 haven't yet con-
vinced y o u , at £ 16.99 it is not at all
cheap, a n d should be bought only if
utterly desperate in the lead up to
Father's Day.
