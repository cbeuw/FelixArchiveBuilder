I
doubt there's been a compila-
tion to date that been so eager-
ly awaited as this. So m u c h so,
that I've seen people buying it with
out even listening to it first (me
included) because y o u k n o w what
your gona get, a a w e s o m e collec-
tion of breaks 'n' beats. The Box
Set w a s released just before
Christmas (excellent timing by the
marketing people, as it m a d e the
perfect Christmas present, I saw
these flying out of the shops, five in
the few hours I was there 8. at £ 3 5
a go that's not bad at all).
All the artists are taken from the
Metalheadz label, and all the mate-
rial is new. N o w these aren't cheap
1 paid £ 3 5 for mine, but y o u d o get
18 tracks in all about 1/2 D8J3 and
1/2 d o w n beat chillers. Showing the
diversity and ability of the featured
artists. W h o are Photek, D o c Scott,
Ed Rush, Dillinja, Optical, Hidden

some of the biggest names in the

shops. I wish I could afford two
copies, one to cain 8. one to keep
untouched, as in times to c o m e
these are going to be serious col-
lectors items and worth money.
So if y o u still haven't brought
one yet, y o u ' d better hurry as only
the first 10,000 copies will be pre-
sented in a highly collectable metal
circular tin, after that it's plain old
cardboard, and last 1 heard 8,000
had all ready been ordered by the
N o w for the music, every single
track does it for me, s o m e very
dark, some futuristic, you've got
s o m e steppers, some laid back
chillers, some are experimental all
are packed full of originality and
total slamming. Some of the high-
lights are D o c Scott's Swarm, a
killer a m e n work out, J Majik's
Future State falls between D8J3 and
d o w n beat, cleaver arrangements
dark ' n ' beautiful, soothing atmos-
phereicals roll behind crazy beats.
Optical's totally tearing remix of To
Shape The Future, it doesn't get
much better than this, and Dillinja's
Warrior Jazz, and that's exactly
what his created a crazy break beat
affair with a jazz lick, awesome.
So all in all, this collection justi-
fies the price tag, just about. I d o
not think a better collection could
have been put together, perhaps a
more out ' n ' out D8J3 numbers
from Photek and Dillinja, but y o u
can't have everything can you?

DRUM & BASS TECHNO/HOUSE
Future Forces Inc. Dead by Dawn
(Renegade Hardware) Out Now.
This is a teaser from the fourth c o m i n g album
Quantum Mechanics, a hotly anticipated collec-
tion from the Trouble o n Vinyl c a m p or
Renegade Hardware there sister label. If this
track is anything to go by it's gona be absolute-
ly tearing.
Starts off with plenty of atmosphericals, dark
stepping beats roll-over the m o o d y strings, with
beats cut in 8. out over the top. Then in drops a
dark stretched acid b-line. Impressive stuff, it's
dark, it's hard, it's intelligent, it's wicked.
Adam F. Music in My Mind
(F-jams) 2nd Feb
Another killer track from one of the men of the
moment, 1 love the Talk Box vocal at the begin-
ning by A d a m himself, giving his voice that
Electro sound, live squelchy b-line, wicked
break beats, stabs of trumpets. It w o u l d not sur-
prise me at all, if it goes top 40. A n d look out
for the remixes that are sure to follow soon.
Ollie vs jon The Dentist. The Fourth Kingdom
(Truelove) Out Now.
This is definitely a track I'd buy, it's what I
w o u l d call banging house. With a trancy feel,
Strong drum rolls, and a pleasant break d o w n .
Jon's mix is harder, more full on, bouncy bass-
line, eerie vocals and hard driven drum rolls.
Sure to keep an up for it crowd going mental.
Viper. The Twister
(Hooj) 26th (an.
This tune use's probably the best sample your
likely to hear, taken from Nina Simones song
" N e w Day" "It's a new dawn, it's a new day,
It's a new life for me 8. I'm feeling g o o d " full of
depth and feeling, and when used with those
banging house beats, thumping b-line 8. m o o d y
strings, it's a sure hit. If this doesn't send a
shiver d o w n your spin nothing will. You have 4
mixes to choose from all on the harder side of
house.
Joey Ducane. Cosmic Funk
(Montana) Out Now
The first time I listened to this one I didn't think
much of it, but o n repeated listening it grew and
grew on me. Funky b-line rolls on 8. on over the
track, the percussion rolls give it that jiggerly
feel, stabs of what sound like trumpets, looped
title sample 8. nice use of funky 70's disco
sounds, sure to keep the floor moving.
George E. Inna City
(Catch) 2nd-9th Feb.
M y favourite mix out of the 5 on offer, is the
2nd on the b-side I think. Where it's given the
dub garage treatment, fat b-line, c h o p p i n g
beats, stabs of the vocal, reminiscent of TJR's
Just Gets Better. Nice diversity of sounds used
with those tuff stepping beats, another quality
production from the Catch crew. Also with
street soul mix, and more vocal 8. upbeat work-
ings as well there's something for everyone.
Blu Mar Ten (Looking Good Rec.)
Global Acess / Myriad. 16th Feb.
As with every release c o m i n g from the LG label
you don't have to listen to it before y o u buy it
as your assured top quality production, and a
deep 'n' meaning full track. A n d this is know dif-
ferent. The trademark precussion rolls, and a
rolling jazz break paints a picture on your mind.
It takes y o u up nice and step, so it can drop you
in nice 'n' deep. Absolutely wicked tune.
Paganini Traxx. Release Yourself.
Out Now
Six mixes to choose from on this one, all but
one are in a hard, trancy, techno house styles
and a wicked break-beat working. For me the
vocal doesn't really fit with the hard ' n ' deep
feel of the track, which is to weak and going on
about nothing. I much prefer the mixes with-
out the vocal keeping it hard 'n' fast.
Banana Republic & The Zoo Experince
Feat. Judy Obeya (Catch)
9th Feb.
There a variety of mixes on this one, my
favourite is yhe 2nd on the b-side, a fat Garage
working, strong s t o m p i n g beats 8. nice W a h
W a h bird s o u n d s e c h o i n g in the
background.Excellent use of Judy's vocal talents,
this is m u c h more a nice tune than an out-right
floor filler.
