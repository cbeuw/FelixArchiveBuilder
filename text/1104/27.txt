Big Brother is watching out for you.
Whether you want to find out who can help in times of crisis, win Â£50 in the House
of Horror competition, or find out about free condoms, Welfare (Accommodation)
Week has something for you.
Welfare (Accommodation) Week wil include exhibits across 4 campuses, bring
a Welfare theme to Da Vinci's Tuesday night quiz, examples of entries in the
House of Horror competition, it will start with a sponsored No-Sleep-In in dBs,
in aid of Shelter, and end with IC's "Check-Your-Bits" Day!

B o l l o c k s
Yes. I am, quite literally, talking bollocks - yours
in particular.
How are they feeling?
Did you realise that men of your age (16 to 35
years old) are in the group at highest risk of
Testicular Cancer? It's a killer.
So, if you haven't been in the habit of check-
ing your testicles for early warning signs of
tumours, may I suggest you start now - it might
save your life.
Cysterly Love?
It's not just the lads who are at risk of sexual
cancers - when was the last time you checked
your breasts? Have you ever? Did you realise
you should also organise cervical smear tests
for yourselves? Everyone knows they're not
fun, but surely it's better than dying of a poten-
tially curable disease.
ICU's "Check Your Bits Day" is
Saturday 14th February 1998
If you don't know how to check yours, find out.
Don't wait until it's too late.
Delaying could kill you.
Get in touch with the Health Centre or your GP.

Calling all
Insomniacs
Fancy spending the night with 49
other people?
We are holding a Sponsored No-
Sleep-In in aid of Shelter (the National
Campaign for Homeless People) in
dBs, on Saturday 7th February 1998.
If you want to join in, sign up in the
ICU Clubs and Societies Resource
Centre (or alternatively, see your
Constituent College Welfare Officer).
Collect your sponsorship form, and get
all your friends, lecturers or parents to
sponsor you to stay awake all night for
a good cause - only sleeping bags and
blankets for comfort, and no Pro-Plus
allowed!
