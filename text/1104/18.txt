ARTS
IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR
Imperial College Fringe Theatre

T
he n e w l y - b o r n IC Fringe
Theatre, a semi-professional
theatre c o m p a n y consisting of
student, staff and external m e m -
bers, was crowned with success
last Wednesday o n its opening per-
formance at the College.
Directed and p r o d u c e d by Dr.
Caroline Baillie from the depart-
ment of Materials, "In Through The
Out Door" was a trilogy of one-act
plays, focusing on the issues of
individual freedom.
The evening began with " O n e
For The R o a d " by Harold Pinter, a
play about a dissident family w h o
have been forced into submission
in a police state. The "face a face"
between Nicolas, the state official,
played by Nick Roberts and Victor,
the father of the persecuted family,
played by Q h y g o e m * z , was laden
with a strong intensity. Without
words, Victor transmitted, by the
convulsion of his face and limbs,
his rage, the unbearable helpless-
ness of his situation, the atrocious
mental torture inflicted u p o n him
and the disgust of a man w h o is
being afflicted more each second,
all of w h i c h enhanced N i c o l a s '
sadistic enjoyment and persever-
ance.
Caroline Baillie interwove the
plays in such a way that the second
play directly followed this c o n -
frontation. There w a s a brief
switching back to the former,
before the last play. Finally, it is the
last scene of the first play which
ends this trilogy, very originally put
together to emphasise the various

potential links between the three.
" G o t c h a ! " , by Barrie Keefe,
focuses on a different kind of indi-
vidual freedom; freedom within the
school system and h o w quickly you
are excluded if y o u d o not fit into
the m o u l d . A n educational system
w h i c h lacks
not only the
ability but also
the will to
make the
most of indi-
vidual capabil-
ities, quickly
m a r g i n a l i s e s
the 'different'
and the weak-
er.
In an ex-
treme situa-
tion, following
a strange turn
of events, the roles of au-thority
are re-versed and the Kid (physics
postdoc M a t t h e w Williams) con-
fronts his s c h o o l teachers and
headmaster. His desperate cry for
attention ends dramatically, as he
is thrown back, banished forever to
his status of outcast in society.
"Hell is others" - probably one
of the most famous lines of French
Theatre, summarises Sartre's " N o
W a y O u t " . U p o n their deaths, t w o
w o m e n and a man arrive in Hell,
one after the other. There is no fire
nor a torturer as they would have
expected but they rapidly realise
that the greatest torture that could
have been imposed upon them was
to be confined together for eterni-
ty. Unable to free themselves, by
death, of the ever growing torture
one inflicts on the other by pressing
upon him for what he will never
get, there is no possibility of
escape.
The actors, Ron Irwin, from the
" E u r o p e a n
A d m i n i s t r a t i o n
Office, as Garcin,
N'Diorel Ba, a final
year chemist, as
Estelle and Caroline
Baillie as Inez, suc-
c e d e e d with bril-
liance in developing
this infernal spiral
w h o s e culmination
goes beyond human
perspective.
Amongst the var-
ious links between
the three plays was
the closed room, with the locked
door. All the time, the audience too
was locked in. Tying the plays
together so closely was an invita-
tion to draw the different charac-
ters together in one way or anoth-
er. It left open the possibility for the
spectator to imagine a character
from one play developing into that
of another and relate a certain
behaviour to its possible evolution
under new conditions.
The production was put on in
the Union, without a stage, making
use of the entire space of the r o o m
with the audience seated all around
it, very close to the actors.
The music was p r o d u c e d in
Australia by Solange Kershaw. She
worked on it in conjunction with
Caroline Baillie via email. Caroline
would email her every night after
the rehearsal and explain her exact-
ly what had been done, h o w the
general feel for the production was
progressing. "The other day I
explained h o w 1 needed to create
the idea of a child's spirit floating
around the parent's heads" she
told Felix.
A n d the result was a wonderful
achievement, music that formed
one body with the acting. But she
added : "Solange and I understand
each other well - we wouldn't have
been able to d o this if we had not
worked together for a long time".
H o w d i d she go about directing ?
"I tend to go by intuition"she said,
emphasizing that she is very con-
scious of not changing that
approach.
Dr. Baillie indeed leads a d o u -
ble career - as scientist and engi-
neer, she understands the con-
straints of rigorousness, and as
actor and director, she wishes to
leave an o p e n space for creativity.
Often asked whether she sees
herself always having these two
separate strands in her life, she
replies that she believes that "soci-
ety is beginning to understand the
need to develop cross-disciplinary
skills, in ancient times, engineers
were also artists and musicians.
W h y should this be so strange
today ?"

MARIO BENZEDRINE'S POP-UP APOCALYPSE
Etcetera Theatre, Camden
T
his is an unnerving, vicious
and shockingly funny play. It
is performed with spectacu-
lar power by the lone Rhodri Hugh,
in a gargantuan physical display of
emotive violence, exploring with
uncontrolled savagery the crisis-
ridden m o d e r n psyche.
M a r i o Leonardo Benzedrine, as
he introduces himself, is a soul on
the very edge of the abyss. The
m o n o c h r o m e set consists o n a ring
of fairy lights, an ethereal door and
an item of strange wheeled m o n o -
g r a m m e d furniture w h i c h M a r i o
later introduces as his wife. The
room is entered by M a r i o , hyperac-
tive, besuited, addressing the audi-
ence, rolling, jumping, pacing every
square inch of the lit circle. Hugh's
portrayal is mesmerising; each bit-
ing phrase given full treatment, the
slightest shudder m a d e brutally
apparent for the invasively close
audience.
The play consists of a single
fifty-five minute monologue, bro-
ken only by the increasingly large
mood-swings of the increasingly
manic performer. The more
deranged he becomes, the more
animal his motions become, the
further we delve into his soul to his
primal fears, the more M a r i o ' s
physical appearance mirrors what
is going on; his pinstripe suit alter-
ing into a mental patient's romper
suit and his pleasant features c o n -
torting in unfathomable emotion
and dazzling verbal torrent. His
m o o d swings coincide with crisp
sound and lighting effects and 180Â°
turns in subject matter; a laying
bare of the layers of the troubled
being before the audience, culmi-
nating in a desperate whirling
crescendo and stark bleak snapping
finish.
W h e n Hugh returned to the
stage for the curtain call it was dis-
turbing to see a normal human
being at the end of it, the audience
temporarily frozen before tearing
d o w n the curtain of tension with
w a r m relieved applause. Only then
did I realise that I had possibly not
been breathing for the last two
minutes and that I couldn't remem-
ber the first thing he had said for
the last hour. N o matter, it is the
journey that is important here, the
route taken is riveting but ultimate-
ly unimportant, taking y o u through
pain, exultation, fear, compassion
and hatred, drawing y o u ever clos-
er. I r e c o m m e n d this play without
reservation. I'm paying to see it
again next week. If y o u think that
y o u can take M a r i o Benzedrine's
terrifying pace, I'll see y o u there.
