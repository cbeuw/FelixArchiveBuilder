The Executive Committee of ICU
reversed the decision reached by
the council last term to submit
joint IC-ICSM entries into BUSA
competitions for all sports.
The new "hybrid" proposal,
which allows selected teams to
enter separately, was backed up by
24 votes to 17. Should this bid be
rejected by BUSA, the official posi-
tion of the Union is to support dual
entries for the next three year.
At present, only five clubs have
clear ideas on the m o d e they will
adopt next year. Whilst separate
entries will be submitted by the
hockey, rugby, and football clubs,
the rowing and fencing teams will
definitely field a combined squad for
BUSA events. The respective clubs
from IC and I C S M must agree
before they can submit a single
entry. However, once this decision
has been taken, they cannot turn
round to d e m a n d for separate
entries the following year. In con-
trast, clubs which originally go for
"dual" mode but subsequently fail to
put up two teams will still have the
option to turn "single".
M o s t departmental representa-
tives from the Royal College of
Science Union voted against the
motion because it stipulated "dual
entry" as the back-up should the
"hybrid" proposal be rejected by
BUSA. Katie Nolan, Broadsheet edi-
tor and RSCU member, said smaller
clubs would lose out. She argued a
combined IC team would perform
better nationally to attract private
sector sponsorship. This w o u l d
reduce their financial dependence
on the Union to the benefit of small-
er clubs.
However, there is no evidence
that this would be the case with the
rowing and fencing teams, the two
sports most frequently cited as the
potential victim of m e d i c s - n o n
medics separation. At the executive
committee meeting, Natasha
N e w t o n , member of the 1C
women's rowing squad, expressed
the indifference towards BUSA c o m -
petitions held by her team. Since the
women's squad are made up entire-
ly of students from St Mary's, its
strength will be unaffected. O n the
men's side, only one member will be
excluded.
Andy Heeps, president of ICU,
said that a hybrid entry would allow
a smoother transfer to single entry:
"It would c o m e together naturally
rather than being forced." He added
that most medics at present d o not
truly regard themselves as part of
IC. The situation will be different
next years, since the new intakes will
be based at South Kensington. He
also disagreed that the Union's
determination to work towards a
single BUSA entry for sports clubs
had implications for other societies.
It is unlikely that the Orchestra,
Opera, and Rag, will be under pres-
sure to merge with their non-
medics counterparts in the future,
and furthermore such mergers
would lead to impractically large
societies anyway. "Certain societies
will be easier to be merge than oth-
ers, with sports soceities, things
were complicated with BUSA."

On Monday 19 January Rt Hon
Tony Benn MP gave a speech in
the Mech Eng Department, host-
ed by ICU Labour Club. M r Benn,
73, s h o w e d a remarkable insight
into the problems of the modern
world: H e warned that if the pleas
of the poor and unemployed were
not heeded, the world could see
another rise of fascism as seen in
the 1930s, born out of the extreme
poverty in Europe.
M r Benn became an M P in
1950. Though forced to step d o w n
in 1960 after inheriting a title, he
re-entered the C o m m o n s in 1963
and has remained there since. He
only left the House briefly in 1984
after losing his Bristol seat to a
Conservative - he is currently M P
for Chesterfield.
He spoke of the current global
political climate, saying that soon
the world would be at the same
cross-roads it faced in the 1930s,
choosing social justice and free-
d o m rather than the easy answer of
dictatorship. The social insurance
that safeguarded everyone, he
added, was now either too expen-
sive or uneconomical. However, he
felt that social welfare was vital,
providing social cohesion and a
backdrop to the lives under it, in
spite of its vast cost with no i m m e -
diate return. The system self-per-
petuates through education, in pro-
viding a new generation of people
e m b e d d e d with a sense of social
responsibility. H e admitted that
this system had c o m e under pres-
sure from economic and media
forces, but their influence could be
countered by society contributing
to building a better future. The
struggle, he foretold, could be long
and painful, hinting nothing short of
d e c o n s t r u c t i o n of the m o d e r n
world will ensure its future.
Tony Benn's speech was heard
by about 100 people, and was
forthright and typically off the cuff.
Throughout his talk he demonstrat-
ed a 'healthy disrespect' for the
Labour leadership without criticis-
ing them personally, saying that he
abhorred personal insults.
A n s w e r i n g questions at the
end, Tony Benn continued to dis-
play a wide knowledge of a number
of fields. However, Tony Benn still
seems optimistic: Whatever the
way of the world, he stills believes
humanity will d o the best it can.
