Dear Ed,
Does anyone know the collec-
tive noun for 'security d o g with
handler? If not, might I suggest
'waste'.
Yours,

Dear Simon Baker
At he the e n d of the liberal
Swinging Sixties, t h e student
leader, Jack Straw c a m p a i g n e d
against cannabis and now, he con-
tinues t o o p p o s e decriminalisation
or legalisation o f 'soft drugs'.
Whatever, your personal beliefs on
the subject, he must be respected
keeping true t o his. In the case of
his son, he took appropriate action
immediately w h e n informed of the
situation. H e acted in a wholly
responsible manner a n d without
hypocrisy, and should be applaud-
ed for doing so.
It w a s unfortunate that Robin
Cook's marriage breakdown had t o
be played out in public. However,
the Government w a s bounced by
the tabloids into having t o deal
with a matter that was of n o con-
sequence t o the general public
whatsoever.
It is widely acknowledged that
Conservative M P s were hounded
out primarily due t o their macro-
e c o n o m i c ineptitude and t o a less-
er extent by financial sleaze.
Where there was Tory sexual scan-
dal in the last parliament, Labour
did not g o o n the attack as Simon
Baker suggested. Again, it was the
press that dictated public m o o d .
I may not agree with Simon o n
many matters, but I h a d always
thought that he w a s above using
'trial by tabloid' as a critique of new
Labour. The personal lives of all
politicians and their families should
not be fair game as they d o not
affect the competencies of the
politicians and are not in the public
interest. Okay, this may sound a
bit p o s t - D i a n a touchy-feely but
w o u l d y o u really like your personal
lives dissected by the general pub-
lic? I don't think s o . N o one, not
even those w h o choose to be in
the public eye deserve this sort of
intrusion. I'm sure that their jobs
are difficult enough without having
to deal with this sort of crap.
N e w Labour's mission is t o
transform a n d m o d e r n i s e t h e
approach of the Labour Party while
remaining true to its socialist ethic
- a n a p p r o a c h w h i c h I remind
Simon Baker w o n Labour an extra-
ordinary election victory.
The Christian values o f t h e
Labour leadership are the same as
those of ethical socialism and are
quite different from the hypocriti-
cal 'Remember the G o o d O l d Days'
attitude of 'Back t o Basics'.

D O H !
Dear Felix,
First I must apologise for yet
another complaint hailing from St.
Mary's. This time, however, it is not
on the subject of union politics
though in this case I wish that it
was. I a m writing t o express m y
disgust at the sports editorial fea-
tured last week. I will not repeat it
but for those w h o were fortunate
enough not to read it I will merely
say that it conveyed the tragic
news of a colleague's death in a
manner which was frivolous, disre-
spectful a n d inappropriate. T h e
writer (Jacob) clearly has n o feel-
ings beyond his desperate wish to
entertain readers desppite such a n
aim being entirely repugnant in this
case. I a m at a loss to know exact-
ly w h y this piece was allowed t o be
published with the insulting juxta-
position of s a d news and upbeat
tone. I w a s under the impression
that it was medics w h o lost respect
for human life but clearly I w a s
wrong. I hope that no-one close to
Simon read this piece. I'm sorry to
be s o sombre but perhaps s o m e
consideration may be used in the
future.
Yours,
Nick Oliver.
As I was with Mr Dunsby at
the time of his tragic death in the
Guadalajara House of III Repute,
I feel it is only correct that 1 com-
ment. Simon's demise at the
hands of the knife-wielding pimp
was sad, untimely and extremely
amusing. Ed.

Dear Felix,
Last year I w a s away o n
exchange t o Germany, and spent a
lot of time getting annoyed by the
bureaucracy. N o w I've c o m e back
to IC, and if anything it's become
even worse over here!
I'm o n the committee of t w o
different societies that have had to
book lecture theatres and in both
cases have wasted hours trying t o
arrange this. T w o years a g o w e
w o u l d have gone t o the person in
charge o f organising lecture the-
atres in a particular department,
c h e c k e d w h i c h lecture theatres
were free and booked them. This is
now impossible.
Instead w e have to g o there
and find it's free, then go and find a
member of staff willing t o take
responsibility, then g o t o t h e
Conference Office a n d book the
r o o m , then s o m e h o w get some-
thing from the Union s o that w e
don't have to p a y (although the
U n i o n said they k n e w nothing
about this w h e n w e asked) and s o
o n ! O f course, none of these 4
people are there w h e n w e want
them t o be, s o everything takes 3
or 4 trips. W h y does everything
have to be s o complicated?
In the year that I've been away
this College has g o t noticeably
more bureaucratic a n d less effi-
cient. I'm sure there are lots of
excuses but these c o m e from peo-
ple whose role in the College or
Union depends o n the levels of
bureaucracy—I w o n d e r whether it's
really necessary.
Is it surprising that w e "can't be
bothered"? I a m sick of this a n d
after this week's organising, I'll join
the apathetic majority.
