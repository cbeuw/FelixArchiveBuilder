enough to make t h e f r A m h s t e w i . It was
in fact perfect weather : in, as
M a r c o pointed out: n o rffln, a ) | Q K A didn't get
too hot.
"Look," said Z e d , a d u f | M f g his glasses, "it
must work. You tell m e w h y it s h o u l d n ' t "
"I don't know why,"' sighed Dan, "but I d o
know that it can't wdfk. I've C O l d ^ M b e f o r e - "
"Yes, but it must." I I . J™ I I
"Look, I really a m sick o f this. If you're so
sure it works why don't y o u just make one, then
sell it and you'll get loads of money...?"
Dan put d o w n the s f H R I l j e had been using
and massaged his hand. "This iS|kil!ing!me, it's
your turn now, M a r c o .
M a r c o reluctantly stoo d u p l a n d took the
spade off Dan. "Explain it^Jgaia, J M , " he said as
he started to dig.
Zed brightened u p i ^ B ^ | i M e l y a n d adjust-
ed his glasses again. " L o o k it's quite simple. You
take a ball made of glass a n d then y o u coat the
inside of it with the stuff they use to make one
way mirrors. Then y o u - "
" H o w w o u l d y o u d o that?" Asked M a r c o ,
looking across at Dan.
"I don't know, but I'll think of a way.
Anyway, y o u coat it with this stuff entirely and
that would mean that y o u ' d be able to look into
the ball but not out. Then, y o u take a torch a n d
you shine it i n . "
"So what?"
"Well, the light w o u l d g o into the ball,
because of it being a o n e w a y mirror, but it
wouldn't get back out. It w o u l d just be reflected,
again and again a n d again."
"So?"
"Don't y o u understand? Y o u w o u l d still be
able to look into the ball, and y o u ' d see the light,
but the light w o u l d never get out. It would just
carry o n glowing and g l o w i n g . "
"Look, Z e d , " said D a n , " 1 asked my father
about it and he said it couldn't work. H e should
know."
" O h G o d , it's Plug," interrupted M a r c o sud-
denly. Dan and Z e d both turned round to look in
the direction he w a s pointing. A y o u n g man w a s

;
He had suffered from oxygi .i si . ,'iion at birth
and was consequently heavily rci.irded. Dan's
mother, w h o w a s a nurse, had told them that he
had a mental age of ftvejsAll.of their parent's had
told them that if they ever made fun of h i m
there would be severe trouble. Ron's physical
age w a s IB and he was heavily built. H e was six
feet five tall and had very%|bard: shoulders!,He,
could have looked quite intimidating if his
mouth wasn't almost perpetually open revealing
a line of very crooked teeth. H i s hair w a s
scraped across his head from a parting that w a s |
barely an inch away from his right ear. "Daniel,
your mother said where you are and said I could
help y o u , " he said hopefully.
" O h , " said Dan.
"Sure you can help," said"N&rcJjP&re need
someone strong like y o u . "
Ron grinned again a n d for a moment it
seemed like he would clap his h | f l g £ r l e didn't
but instead asked what they were doing.
Zed explained that they were digging four
holes to put four posts into. The posts would
become the corners of their hut. H e showed
Ron the one hole that had the big stone in it that
they couldn't move. They were intending to get
a crowbar to move it later. "Or maybe you could
move it?" asked Dan.
Ron's face became very serious a n d it
looked as if he was in deep thought. "1 think I
can move it," he said after a long while just as
Dan w a s about to make a comment. H e slowly
and precisely rolled up both the sleeves of his
tracksuit t o p and then got onto his knees. Dan
noticed that he had perfectly manicured finger-
nails and felt a twinge of shame; Almost auto-
matically he clenched his o w n hands to hide his
own fingernails which were brutally short and
ragged. H e h a d bitten them from a very early
age but ha his life w out it until
this m mcnt. H e w a s surprised to find that he

Ron r e a c h ® d o w n intO;
the small hollow
underneath the rock a n d started to pull. They
;COuld almost hear the muscfes:tensing like ropes
tin the c!if:f::;that w a s his back; Z e d clenched his
w t s H a r p B o o k e c l o n with a bemused expres-
sion. " G o o n . ' breathed f i d .
Ron's face turned red and his whole body
began to quiver. Then, quite suddenly, with a
kind of ripping sound the rock came upwards
taking a large chunk of the earth and grass with
" A w e s o m e , " exclaimed Dan, putting a lin-
gering emphasis o n the first syllable. For a
moment he was again angry with himself for let-
ting the admiration become so evident in his
svoice, but when he saw the expression o n Ron's
face he couldn't help but genuinely grin along
with the rest of them. Ron had fallen flat o n his
face, and w a s wiping dirt from his clothes. H e
looked like he had single-handedly-moved a
mountain, which w a s not that far removed from
the truth. " A crow bar w o u l d not have helped a
lot there. That w a s bloody amazing, R o n , "
remarked M a r c o .
Ron looked like he w a s going to float away,
but quite suddenly his face became contorted
with a mixture of shock and pain. H e yelped and
grabbed violently at the back of his neck. M a r c o ,
Zed, and Dan simultaneously leapt backward in
fright.
"What's wrong, Ron? Are y o u okay?"...
