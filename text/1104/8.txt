8 COLUMNS 23 January 1998
Religion is, and always has
been, a funny old game. It
leads people to believe all sorts of
odd ideas both for and against the
proposition. It even has me agree-
ing with that fellow right-winger
Karl M a r x insofar as it is in major
part a doctrine of social control
that has assured the dominant
position of the Church in most
societies. Sadly, it does not make
for scintillating letter page
debates; those of y o u w h o have
been here longer than is healthy
will recall such an episode in 1993.
Which brings us to last week's edi-
tion. Normally I can see no justifi-
cation for anonymity o n the Felix
letters page, but w h e n one writes
such an astonishingly ill-construct-
e d letter as our 'astonishingly
pissed-off biochemical friend, I'll
accept that there are w h e n one
should hide one's light under a
bushel. Though I agree broadly
with what was said, y o u are only a
slightly sticky wicket criticising the
coherency of W e s Hinsley's article.
There is also little point getting
personal w h e n y o u are criticising
an article as flawed as the one in
question. I have no intention of
entering the debate, but I must say
a few words about M r Hinsley's
letter. The style of it started to set
alarm bells ringing- dissect the
points exhaustively, intersperse
vagueness with accurate irrele-
vance. The lad's a professional, I
thought, and, would you believe it,
what did I see o n
the w a l k w a y i
today? A poster Qj

given by none
other than W .
Hinsley. It is
i n d e e d a small
world, whether or
not y o u believe!
H e created. In
short, m y Felix
colleagues have unwittingly given a
platform to an evangelical tam-
bourine operator. Knowing what
fine chaps they are, I know this will
not happen again. Religion is fine
for discussion, but unlike politics,
cannot be discussed usefully by
c
o
; u o
those at either end of the spec-
trum. I will stop short of suggest-
ing that Christian fundamentalism
disrupts normal intellectual
processes. You've had your fifteen
minutes of fame, W e s . This is not
the forum for religious zealotry, I'm
afraid.
The dear old
f I N U S s e e m s to
m a k i n g waves
again. Firstly,
^ they are sug-
gesting that w e
f + drink less,
1 adhering to the
fTv D e p a r t m e n t of
Health figures,
which have been
called into ques-
tion, particularly
p - f with respect to
the low recom-
m e n d e d intake for w o m e n .
Secondly, the N U S President,
Douglas Trainer is arousing o p p o -
sition within the ranks. Though not
a member of this august body, 1
always avidly follow and ignore
their edicts; if a bunch of self-
important, ideologically bankrupt
muppets think they can reduce my
forays into Southside Bar, which
has started the year in characteris-
tically magnificent style, they are
sorely mistaken. Ideological bank-
ruptcy partly explains the second
issue. Time was w h e n the N U S
spouted utter drivel, but drivel that
had conviction. N o w a d a y s , the
position of President is simply
used as a stepping stone to a safe
Labour seat. Though the idea that
the N U S are in the pocket of N e w
Labour is hardly a startling revela-
tion, it never ceases to amaze me
the lengths to which people like
Douglas Trainer will go in order to
further their o w n interest, with vir-
tually no regard for the people
who foolishly elected them. Did
you really expect opposition to
tuition fees f r o m the National
Union of Sycophants?
T h o u g h t f o r t h e D a y :
Neurotics
R
isk, as the television c o m -
mercial goes, is sadly part of
our everyday lives, and for
each negative facet of existence,
there has developed a mentally
unbalanced f o r m of individual
w h o s e w r e t c h e d life is d e e p l y
affected by the undesirable in
question. Those w h o d o not fancy
themselves as S i g m u n d Freud
would put this rather more simply:
all p e o p l e w o r r y occasionally.
Some people worry a lot.
Everybody knows a neurotic.
They live inside a self-fabricated
padded cell. (No, that's not a styl-
ish new piece of IKEA furniture.)
They distort knowledge, enhance
its negative characteristics a n d
then use it to destroy their o w n
happiness. Their minds are black
holes of worry; singularities w h o s e
event horizon pulls misery from the
outside world and traps it forever
in an infinitely massive point of
concentrated pain.
Shakespeare knew. (But he still
couldn't spell his o w n name.) Have
not generations of neurotics sym-
pathised with Hamlet's dilemma of
life and death, suicide or revenge;
his lonely vigil of patient considera-
tion. The science of self-analysis
will be familiar to every chronic
worrier; an endless circle of con-
templation, looking for the bright
side and never finding it; drowning
m e n never finding that elusive
straw. For the most extreme cases,
paranoia creeps in. M a n y find
solace only in death.
I a m a self-confessed neurotic;
a black body radiator of negative
vibes. Misery is my only real c o m -
panion. M a n y hours of my life have
been spent in reclusive isolation,
suffering over potential risks that
others would dismiss immediately,
and get o n with their everyday
lives.
Still, never mind. W h o ' s for a
pint?
