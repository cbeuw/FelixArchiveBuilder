On January 14th,
the R.C.S, held their
annual Winter Dance
in Ayrton Hall.There
was a great demand
for t i c k e t s , and a l l 400 were sold before hand,
with the result that there were none available
on the door. The l i s t of women's colleges to
which t i c k e t s were sent had been modified, and
i t was pleasant to see new faces.
The music was provided by the Clubmen Sextet,
with gramophone records during the i n t e r v a l , A
feature of the dance was the large number of spot
prises, which ranged from mousetraps to chocolate
cigarettes and water p i s t o l s .
The dance ended at 11.30p.m. and i t was
unanimously agreed that the dance was a great
success.

College at King's i n the second round of the i n t e r -
col.leciate debating tournament-. I.C, was represented
by Les Allen, John Bingham, Terry Smith and Fred
Spriggs. The motion, which was drawn from a sealed
envelope 15 minutes before the beginning of the
debate, was "Selfishness i s the secret of success;
Kind's won the toss, and elected to oppose the
notion, thus leaving Allen the unhappy task of
opening the debate
Both teams found the going hard, and no speech
reaLly staort out. The three judges, marking out of
400 points a team, awarded a win to King's by 225
points to 206,
