UNION REASSURED
THE SMALL WINDOWS WHICH HAVE TO BE ENLARGED.
The Union has been assured several times
since Christmas that the new Union b u i l d i n g w i l l
be available by next October. Various doubts as
to the probobility of t h i s had been expressed
by some members of the student body, e s p e c i a l l y
when i t was learned that the small windows fac-
ing the Albert Hall were to be enlarged. People
who have seen these from the inside w i l l r e a l i s e
that the Sectors insistance upon this matter was
j u s t i f i e d , but the fact that they had been b u i l t
t h i s way was an unfortunate error on the part of
a c i v i l engineer. He had not detected the weak
o r i g i n a l w a l l containing these windows, and they
were to have been l e f t i n o r i g i n a l l y t o save
expence and time. Council told the Rector that
they didn't want the windows enlarged i f i t was
going to be used as an excuse for not completing
the b u i l d i n g on schedule. To ensure t h i s , i t has
been arranged that the bricklayers whose job w i l l
be shortly completed on the main wall section w i l l
be transferred to t h i s new task.
The frame work of the building should be
finished s h o r t l y , but i t i s feared that the severe
weather may be used as an excuse f o r invalidating
the penalty clause. F u l l advantage was not taken
of the excellent November weather which gave a
great spurt of progress t o the Roderick H i l l
building.
IS IT PROGRESSING?
EASTER RUGGER TOURS
The C i t y and Guilds College Union have made a
grant of £50 towards a rugger tour of Holland
during the vacation. This i s on condition that
f i f t e e n Guildsmen play at least two matches under
t h e i r College name. This comes as a reply to the
Royal College of Science Union's grant of £50
towards a combined tour of Holland i n which they
a n t i c i p a t e * up to ten of t h e i r members p a r t i c i p -
ating. The Royal School of Mines w i l l have t h e i r
usual f i x t u r e s i n Cornwall t h i s Easter.
A l i t t l e c a l c u l a t i o n w i l l show that engineers
w i l l recieve £3-6-8 towards t h e i r expenses, while
s c i e n t i s t s w i l l recieve at least £5-0-0 each.
This may not be a true r e f l e c t i o n of the value of
these commodities, but i t suggests that some of
our l o c a l grant-giving authorities are not con-
forming with the opinions expressed at the last
I.C. Union meeting.
REFECTORY LOSSES
Mr Mooney has found that his losses i n running
the Refectory are not confined to straight forward
administration losses, but that they also include
the disappearance of some of his equipment.
Besides the small glasses and tea spoons that
have obviously been misplaced recently, i t was
found that a large copper e l e c t r i c milk urn was
missing from the snack bar last Monday morning.
The security o f f i c e r i s hot on the t r a i l , and
hopes t o have retrieved i t shortly.He thinks i t
might well have been u n o f f i c i a l l y borrowed during
the weekend, but the p o s s i b i l i t y of outside theft
i s not excluded.
I.C. UNION MEETINGS TO BE IN R.C.S.
As a r e s u l t of the damage done to the large
lecture theatre i n the C i t y and Guilds College at
the last I.C. Union general meeting, the Dear of
the College, Professor Saunders has forbidden any
more I.C. meetings there. He w i l l however allow
the C i t y and Guilds t o have a Union meeting there
this term, and future meetings w i l l depend upon
the behaviour at t h i s meeting.
