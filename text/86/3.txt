Lectures on t o p i c * of general Interest were
f i r s t introduced into the College i n 1946, bat i t
was not u n t i l Oct. 1952, that 'General Studies',
lunch-hour lectures twice weekly, were started.
The purpose of these lectures i s t o provide stud-
ents with help i n shaping t h e i r own culture, and
to provide a l i b e r a l education.
The need i n t h i s College f o r the 'General
Studies' lectures cannot be overestimated. Owing
to early s p e c i a l i s a t i o n i n highly technical sub-
j e c t s , the average student tends to have a (some-
what narrow outlook. The F i f t h Annual Report of
the S c i e n t i f i c Advisory Council stated: "A scien-
t i s t whose t r a i n i n g has been broadly based can
quickly learn other s p e c i a l i t i e s . The narrow
s c i e n t i s t i s rarely able t o step outside the con-
fines of h i s own p a r t i c u l a r interests."
How have these lectures been recieved by the
students? S t a t i s t i c s on the weekly attendance over
the past four years makes interesting reading.
During 1952-54 attendance was high, but there has
been a noted lack of interest shown during the past
two years. Is this due t o the apathy of I.C. stud-
ents or t o the lack of appeal of the lectures? The
former seems to be the case as the lectures have
been of diverse interest, the topics ranging, from
Flemish Paintings to Anthropology, and the speakers
have been men of authority i n t h e i r p a r t i c u l a r f i e l d ,
One reason for the dwindling i n attendance
at 'General Studies' could a t t r i b u t e d to the
increase i n a c t i v i t i e s of many Social Clubs, which
now hold meetings during the lunch-hours; t h i s can
however, only be a minor factor. The main reason i s
probably the j u v e n i l i t y of the average I.C. student
who has not yet neached the age of attending l e c t -
ures provided by the College Authorities f o r his
own benefit, v o l u n t a r i l y . 'General Studies'
lectures play an important part i n a u n i v e r s i t y
education.
Do students come t o I.C. to'obtain a univ-
e r s i t y education i n the f u l l sense o f the term,
or to be trained as technicians having no other
interests apart from t h e i r own subject? The
l a t t e r type of student can only be deplored,
p a r t i c u l a r l y as they are given every opportunity
to obtain a general education.

I apologias for my part i n mis-spefling the
report on the Union Meeting discussion on d i s c r e -
pancies i n granvs. I t i s too easy t o drop a l e t t e r .
Reporting a court case i n New Zealand, the "News
of the World" states that the 19 year old leader
of a series of orgies was senteneed"to be sent t o
a c o r r e c t i v e i n s t i t u t i o n f o r minors f o r 3 years.
Let's hope he arrives oefore the Carnival.
There seems to be a large quantity of straw
t r a i l i n g into the new Aero Block. We hope they are
studying the p o s s i b i l i t i e s of Pegasus s t a l l i n g be-
cause the only other person who could be interested
in horses i s Mooney.
For those who do not already know t h i s , lost
property may often be retrieved from Mrs. Robinson
at the Union Office. Mr. Henry (179 Queen's Gate)
i s waiting f o r the owner of quite a nice raincoat
to turn up and claim i t .
The author of the college wine l i s t need
not hawe contradicted himself about burgundy godn..,
with oysters. Who around here i s interested i n
having oysters f o r dinner.
STUDENTS IN THE NEWS: Reynolds News reports
the following profound comments from a London"
University engineering student at the Humphrey
Lyttlieton Club:- "Humph i s the tops. I can't explain
i t but his music gets under my skin and I just
have t o do something. It kind a gets into you.see?"
An eariy 19th century map of*this area
shows that the only b u i l d i n g on;
the nresent s i t e
of the college was a workhouse where the admin-
i s t r a t i o n o f f i c e s now stand —what did they
use to do with t h e i r Christmas puddings? - —
and what can they possibly do with college
calendars which are l e f t over?
A c e r t a i n I.C. lecturer,who l e f t his luncn
on the train*aanaged to retrieve i t "from the
lost property o f f i c e to eat i t at the usual time.
We would be Interested to hear of any student who
boycotts the college refectory with such savage
fervour.
