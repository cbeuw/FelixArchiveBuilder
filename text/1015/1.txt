Beit Fight Probed
BY ANDREW SMITH
Mystery still surrounds the
events which led to four ICU
stewards requiring hospital
treatment on Saturday 26th
November. The phone call
procedures made to the police are
being scrutinised following
evidence that the police were not
made known of the urgency of
the situation.
Following the fray in Beit
Quad, college security insist that
two calls were made requesting
assistance, at 2.26am and 2.55am.
Whilst Scotland Yard's Press
Bureau have admitted that the
first call was received, they
dispute the statement of the
security guard placing the call
who has said that violent action
taking place was reported. The
police have the call recorded as
only reporting a theft, which had
already been reported by the
victim and hence they had not
responded immediately to the
call.
Mr Keith Reynolds, Head of
Security of Imperial College, has
agreed that in communication
between college security and
police that there may have been a
'bit of confusion' on 'both sides
of the fence'. While defending the
actions of security he admitted
that 'this one may have got away
from us a bit', but insisted that he
would try his best to make sure
that 'nothing like this ever
STOP!

happens again.'
Since the event was last
reported, ( F E L I X 1014), exp-
lanations have become available
as to why college security did not
attempt to restrain the alleged
assailants of the Union Stewards.
One of the officers present at the
time has explained that as
security were under the
impression that one of the
assailants was a civil engineering
student, he could easily be
pursued through college
procedures. In addition, since the
situation was so tense that any
intervention by security could
have led to further fighting, it
was decided not to pursue the
attackers at the time.
With departmental and
college photographs as yet not
leading to any successful
identifications by those Union
Stewards involved in the
incident, the offenders remain at
large. While confirming that
Union records of people signed in
that night were not any help,
some leaving only first names
and others being completely
indecipherable, Terry Briley,
Deputy head of security, has said
that it 'would of course help if
accurate records were kept'.
College security have once again
appealed for anyone with any
knowledge as to the identity of
the perpetrators of the assault to
come forward in total
confidentiality.
Lucy Chothia, Imperial College Union President, was hospitalised las
when her jaw locked as she yawned, writes Rachel Walters. Lucy spe
days in Charing Cross hospital so that she could shut her mouth agai
said that she was 'just walking to the bus stop with an old schoolfriend
she yawned so widely that her jaw clicked out of place leaving her m
stuck open. Explaining the incident, the ICU President admitted that s
a weak jaw, and that in fact, she had the problem as a 15 year old. Lu
denied that boredom may have been a factor, but conceded that she h
'feeling quite tired recently'.
Millionaire Miner
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Hopes for the prospects of
Imperial graduates were raised
this week with the news that a
Royal School of Mines alumnus
earns £14 million a year.
Kaveh Alamouti, 39, is in his
fourth year at the Tokai Bank
using quantum theory to work
the stock market.
He followed his under-
graduate degree in mineral
technology with a masters at the
London Business School (LBS),
but stresses that Imperial gave
him the background math-
ematical skills that make him so
successful today. Speaking to
