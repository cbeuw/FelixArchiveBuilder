James Fox, who both progressed
to the finals of the 200m back-
stroke and the 200m individual
medley (both are in the top six in
the country l'oi hoih events).
Andrew Westhcad narrowly
missed winning the 200m
butterfly final and was placed
10th. Other notable performances
were achieved by Daniel Halls
and Mike Young in the 50m
butterfly.
The 100m backstroke saw
the trio of Chris Davies, James
Fox and James Ralph
consistently out-perform the
other teams.
Boris Schlittgen gave a
fighting last 50m sprint in the
200m breaststroke to achieve a
personal best time and finished
in the top 20. Condolences to
Pepe Aparico who would have
made the final of the 50m
backstroke had he not hit his
head on the bottom of the pool!
Finally it should be noted
that these performances were
achieved on only 2 swimming
sessions a week at the Imperial
College Sports Centre. What is
now needed is more pool time
in the build-up to the Long
Course Championships in
Crystal Palace in March.

On Saturday 19th November,
we progressed to the next stage
of the UAU championships.
Outstanding performances
by the talented forward, Theo
Papatheodosiou, scorer of eight
goals and the two hard men of
the team, Stueart 'The Thug'
Collins and Daniel 'The Killer'
Halls scored ten goals each. The
quality and ferocity of the play
was such that UCH and
Portsmouth University declined
to play!!
Many thanks go to Norman
Jones of the IC Sports Centre
whose superb organising skills
made the afternoon a great
success. The next stage of the
tournament will be held on the
21st of January 1995 at the
Sports Centre.
