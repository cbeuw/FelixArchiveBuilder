0 To end as we started. The ghosts of music editors past and
present fight it out over the last black and silver circles of 94.
Shakespeare and Stoppard came to imperial as dramsoc
double whammied out with hamlet and rosencrantz and
guildenstern are dead. Rebecca Butlin and David Cohen
respectively braved the thespic haunts and giggles.
If the Beatles can do it so can the little man with the big ear
trumpet. Well, the sixteen choir have released Bach's mass
in B minor. Up and attam says James White.
The punk and the princess played in Portobello, so Patrick
Wood went along and caught a glimpse of the q.t. Arnie got
fat in junior and claimed it wasn't steroid abuse - J.Ho
laughed along. Then Patrick returns to rue the lack of s*x,
violence and long camera shots in vanya on 42nd street.
The resurrection of Cobain continues thanks to pearl jam's
vitalogy - Vik waits for three days. Elsewhere He/en-Louise
trumps to the sound of die toten hosen, a/ok grinds his teeth
at Joni Mitchell and Vik 'does' the almighty 'live' (ykwim?).
Waxing lyrical over a part of London this week is K.C. She cuts
a swath through the london traffic courtesy of the trusty
routemaster and the number 10 bus route.
0 rotation
Well this week we return to
rotation's opening line-up of the
year as current and ex music
editors,: vik and tintin, respectively
take to the hot seat...
oasis - whatever
t; so the band of the year go for
the Christmas No. 1 as well.
H m m m . I'm not sure that this
song is as good as the singles
they've taken off 'definitely
maybe' but it's pretty catchy and
has loads of strings.
V; perhaps they should have
teamed up with Cliff?
f; no way he couldn't sing in that
hard mane accent.
gary young - plant man
v; a very bad nursery rhyme with
an annoying voice, minimal
instrumentation and plain juvenile
lyrics - "plant man knows where
the plants will go, plant man
knows that the plants will grow." I
think the plant man got grass
mixed up with crass,
f; yeah but this is Gary Young of
Pavement fame so he's obviously
going to be pretty screwy
whfl: .loes.
elevatorman - funk and drive
v; "funk me, baby...funk me and
epidemic?
t; vik you old grumble puss;: this is
a meaningful song about the
driving. Crossness has nothing to
do with it..err..,can I have my pills
now please?
loni dark - love's got me high
got you high when you hear this.
Anything less and you might slit
t; you're really not in a good
mood are you? Maybe you should
have one of my tablets...
bomb the bass - darkheart
v; seven minutes of meandering,
pseudo-atmospheric dub/dance
crud. Bomb this...
1; I think that the readers/should
totally nice, even normal guy who
likes pressing flowers and reading
poetry. Honest,
throwing muses -
bright.yellow gun
v; another simple, non-sugary
pop outing from the twisted mind
of Kristin Hersh.
t: I kinda agree on that one but I
don't think her mind is twisted at
all, I mean you're the one who
wanted to review the
Queensryche album.
On the programme it says,
"Something is Rotten in the State of
Denmark". Well whatever it is, it's
not the acting. Dramsoc's hamlet
boasts an impressive cast who, if a
little stiff at the beginning, certainly
liven up throughout the play. Apart
from a couple of dubious choices,
the cast are well selected and most
importantly, believable.
Although on the whole the
parts were played in a plausible
manner, there are some which
stand out among the rest. Mathew
Williams delivers an excellent
portrayal of the confused and
unstable Hamlet, who, for the
majority of the time, appears to be
on the verge of a nervous
breakdown. Gulenn Tambe gives a
smouldering performance as the
sometimes rather weakly portrayed
Gertrude and Katherine Fishwick is
extremely competent in her role as
the tragic, not to mention dippy,
Ophelia. Joe McFadden (Laertes)
and Ed Mulligan (Polonius) are also
good.
The direction appears to run
smoothly, although I'm not
convinced that the 'microphone
ghost' works. The costumes are
colourful and although I did doubt
the wisdom of director Iqbal Khan,
when he dressed Hamlet in black
modern costume, I have to admit
that it works - although I think
that's as much to do with the
henna as anything else.
Rosencrantz a n d guilden-
stern are dead (or R&G as it is
affectionately known by its
production team) is a brilliant
attempt by Tom Stoppard at
presenting Shakespeare's Hamlet
from the point of view of two minor
courtiers battling to find meaning in
their existence. Jim Kingston
{Rosencrantz... ummm, or was he
Guildenstern?) and Rys Jaszek (the
other one!), accompanied by an
assortment of uncanny characters,
present a rumbling tumbling
delivery of witty word plays. Jim
seems well at home with his
character and the two manage to
produce some smart dialogue.
Occasionally the pace was let down
by stumbling support, but hard
headedness (literally!) and
determination prevailed and the
show went on. All said and done
the first night's performance that I
saw was a valiant try at a very
difficult play. To the unsuspecting
viewers who may have found this
play somewhat bizarre, if not totally
incomprehensible,'! say: see
Hamlet and the penny will drop, my
bet is, heads up! Â©
