I, your Frater, feel that it is time to
examine mine own position; for at
times when I feel gifted with
awareness, the realisation hits me
that many will say "What a load of
bullshit" about my delicate tracts.
Why do they make this rash
assumption? Suffering from curios-
ity I consulted an accomplice of
mine, and his eventual response
was that I expressed ideas which
were unexpected by my reader-
ship. Intriguing, thought I. It seems
obvious that the ideas expressed
may be initially unknown to those
who wade through these turgid
texts, but surely that is the whole
purpose of any piece of writing.
After all, if what I said was already
known to you, then why should I
say it at all? One feels that it
would be mere back slappery to
do so.
Granted then that your good
Frater makes unexpected gestures
towards murderers, darkness,
smokers and so on - and surely it
must be relevant to do so - but
why then must he couch his ideas
in so many words, so much para-
phernalia?
He replies that he would
never want for his column to be
obvious. He likes a puzzle, as it
were, and his words are not there
to be glanced at and discarded
like a repeated Neighbours plot,
but should be studied at length.
Not everything is left there in the
open but the most subtle elements
are disguised, hidden or even
neglected in their entirety. Clues
are interlaced with graphics in a
tapestry of word, idea and image.
That is his aim.
So I am aware that many
may scan briefly over these words
without a thought, but for those
who feel inclined to make the
effort to consider the gracings of
these pages more fully, the
rewards to them will be boundless.

My mother married 'beneath' her.
Consequently we are not allowed
home at Christmas, or at least it is
obvious that we are not welcome
at the bridge. This never bothered
me particularly until about five
years ago when at a wedding in
Co. Galway a big scrap broke out -
an us against them matter; proba-
bly over a
Cooper in high noon I strode boldly
into the heaving throng, learning
very quickly that school biology
lessons and a little rugby are less
of an assistance to the combative
skills than wielding the loy and
throwing wet bales of hay around
all day. My Mother at this point
gave the old boy his instructions for
in relative safety, and then
returned to the throng and
leathered every last one of them. A
display of controlled violence as
exiting and disgusting as I have
ever seen outside of the army. He
picked up his hat and walked out
of the hotel to total silence. By his
expression I thought that I was in
an unfath-
"they used "I was in an unfathomable depth of shite... " o m a b i e
depth of
to mind
our sheep" comment or the like. It
became obvious as the fists and
quiffs began to quiver that the
London exiles would be required to
even up the odds, and avenge or
protect the family name as the case
may have been. I thought this was
great being seventeen and drunk
with several bridesmaids to
impress. Like a youthful Gary
my rescue. He was not called upon
nor was he inclined to lend his
assistance to the initial exchange,
but now that the battering I was
taking was becoming less comical,
he sought to impress his will on the
Draghennys. Firstly, he grabbed
me by the hair and physically
pulled me across the stout-greased
floor to a place that I could bleed
shite. He went across the road and
sat in the car. I followed him at a
discreet distance, as discreet as a
drunk and bleeding teenager can
be at least; I opened the car door.
He was listening to the football
results on the radio, it being a S a t -
urday. "Stoke City", he said in
obvious disappointment "four-
one.". "Bugger" I said. Glyph
