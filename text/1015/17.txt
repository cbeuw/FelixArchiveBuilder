The sixteen choir was founded in
1977 by Harry Christophers to
specialise in the performance of
choral works at the extremities of
the classical spectrum - from the
Renaissance and the twentieth
century. Since then the sixteen
have expanded their repertoire to
include pieces from the Baroque
period. It is a recording of such a
work that forms their latest
release, Bach's mass in B minor.
Bach seems to have
composed this mass and other late
works for no apparent reason
other than to lay down a record of
his skill at composition. For many
reasons, not least its length, the
work was unsuitable for liturgical
use. Despite this, Bach expended
much energy on the production of
what is arguably his greatest
choral work.
Although the idea of a mass
on this scale saw its fruition late in
his life, Bach borrowed extensively
from his earlier works; originality
was not as much of a major
criterion for critical acclaim as it is
today. In composing the B minor
mass, Bach drew on two main
sources: a kyrie and gloria
composed in 1733 as a showpiece
for a prospective royal patron, and
a sanctus written in 1724 for a
Christmas service. Most of the
remaining movements are
reworked arias and choruses from
Bach's existing cantatas.
It is a matter of contention as
to the forces Bach envisaged for a
performance of the work (in fact
he never heard the work
performed in its entirety), but
today, for 'authentic' perform-
ances, two schools of thought
prevail: the 'one voice per part'
advocates and those who prefer to
use a choir of about thirty voices.
The new recording by the sixteen
is of the latter type with twenty six
voices in the chorus, five soloists
and an orchestra of twenty nine
players. Harry Christophers
produces a well balanced sound
from them.
In terms of interpretation
there really isn't much distinction
between this recording and, say,
John Eliot Gardiner's of almost ten
years ago; slight variations of
tempo and dynamics and different
voices for the solos being the most
obvious. At the very least this
maintains the high standards
which the sixteen have set in their
previous recordings. 0
The punk and the princess began
as a school essay written by the 14
year old Gideon Sams. His mother
fished it out of the bin and it
became 'the punk', a cult novel
with a safety pin through its cover,
which sold twenty three thousand
copies from the music shops of 70s
London.
The film is billed as an update
of Romeo and Juliet in 90s Notting
Hill. (Our very own Queen's Tower
appears slap in the middle of the
final shot.)
Punk David spends his time
shooting pool, strumming his guitar
and spray-painting his squat. He
falls in love with rich American girl
Rachel, who just happens to be
playing Juliet at the local theatre.
Jealousy arrives in the form of
vicious biker Stray Cat. There is
fencing with pool cues to the sound
of Prokofiev.
Director Mike Same's career
nosedived in 1970 with the release
of 'myra breckinridge', which was
about a transsexual film critic and
starred Raquel Welch. Eulogized by
Andy Warhol and panned by film
critics, its fate was sealed. In the
punk and the princess Same gets
away with having his cake and
eating it. The film claims to be
based on Shakespeare, but in fact
this is no West Kensington Story,
and the parallels with Romeo and
Juliet drawn in Leonard Bernstein's
musical don't stand up in this case.
Who cares though, when the fly-on-
the-wall, hand-held camera style
makes the street banter of David
and his mates so vivid and fun. He
looks a bit lobotomised in the love
scenes but Rachel's lovely, and
some of it's very funny. He shows
her his diary: "I'll never finish it
though," he confides. "...I can't
spell." Discuss, with reference to the
Bard and the National Curriculum.
Junior is a film about how a
scientist (Arnold Schwarzenegger)
becomes the first ever pregnant
man after he decides to act as
guinea pig for his wonder
pregnancy drug, Expectane. The
film also stars Danny DeVito as a
gynaecologist and Emma Thompson
as a researcher who has succeeded
in freezing human eggs.
Like Twins, which also stars
Schwarzenegger and DeVito
together, the idea behind the film is
too silly for the audience to accept.
So it is only the charming
performances given by the three
main actors which makes Junior a
delightful and enjoyable film to
watch. Sure, the idea of Arnie in
drag in the later scenes probably
seems unoriginal after Robin
Williams' recent performance in
Mrs. Doubtfire but still, it is very
funny and shows how successfully
Schwarzenegger can switch
between action films like 'true lies'
and comedy.
Watch in amazement as Arnie's
stomach enlarges as the months go
by and laugh at his bewilderment
as he experiences and learns more
about what it is like to be a woman.
Why do I always get saddled
with these highbrow art-house
movies? My preferred form of
entertainment may be an evening
of Wagner, but when it comes to
the cinema I want car-chases,
shoot-outs and lashings of
gratuitous kinky sex. (Well OK then,
let's not be greedy; if there was
enough gratuitous kinky sex I could
probably do without the car-
chases.)
Actually I ended up with vanya
on 42nd street by default. In the
cinema editor's word association
test I was the only one who didn't
respond to Chekhov with "phasers
locked on, Captain". For this is
Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya,
adapted by David Mamet for
theatre director Andre Gregory.
Louis Malle has filmed a run-
through of Gregory's production in
New York's disused New
Amsterdam Theatre. The action is
mostly in close-up, which is
disconcerting when Yelena (Julianne
Moore) bares her fearsome canines
at the camera. While the
protagonists are all obviously very
committed and the acting first-rate,
one is left with the thought that
Chekhov didn't intend his
characters to be observed from a
distance of never more than six
feet. And what is potentially a
fascinating venue, the dilapidated
theatre, isn't sufficiently exploited. It
would certainly be a great place for
a shoot-out. 0
