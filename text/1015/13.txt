POLITICAL SCIENCE
CluedUp
The government's science policy
has, like many others, been kicked
around between the idealistic liber-
tarian and pragmatic intervention-
ist camps. The recent budget and
edicts issued from HMT and DoE
over this year have highlighted this
football game.
On the one side there's the
definite - and sensible - push for
Universities to stand up on their
own two feet. Yet short term
actions confuse this aim. For
example, Universities are not
allowed to charge the government
the full cost of tuition fees. For
example, recent budget proposals
disallow flexibility in VAT payments
over the long term, a system used
by Universities to free up cash flow
in capital expenditure projects. For
example, the DoE has started to
hand out Â£500 to first year engi-
neering students, thus artificially
inflating the demand for these
degrees. For example, the govern-
ment's stated policy is to fund
research which "creates wealth",
thus contradicting the assumption
one would have that the market
would be able to deal with wealth
creating research and that the gov-
ernment should maybe concentrate
on funding basic research. The list
of examples go on.
But despite the unsure signals
coming from the policy makers, the
year as a whole has had several
good points for science, and for IC
in particular. IC's bid to form a
BMS seems vigorous and exciting.
And the formation of the Russell
Group can only be good news for
IC and its members.
On the wider front, the
Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority's (HFEA)
report on Ovarian Tissue in
research is an example of how to
tackle complex scientific issues.
And to tackle them in a way that
the public understands and appre-
ciates. The HFEA's approach is a
constructive alternative to the
sound bites that scientists and poli-
cy makers are training themselves
to perform.
Finally, and on a "lighter"
note, if you might be wondering
where all this science is leading us,
then John McCarthy - one of the
fathers of Al - is giving a lecture on
Lemmings (yes, the computer
game!) as a new laboratory animal
for Al. Date: 14th of December at
1400, Venue: Huxley 311.

NEW WORLD ORDER
The end of the twentieth century is
witnessing a widening gap
between the rich and the poor
nations. Developed nations are
zooming down the Information
Highway, whilst the underdevel-
oped are busy fighting wars, dis-
ease and poverty - quite a world of
contrasts.
"The Third
World does not
needpity..."
Every time wars break out, or
famines decimate Africa or any
other Third World nation, disturb-
ing television pictures are beamed
around the globe urging ordinary
citizens to act. Aid agencies set up
hot-lines for donations, pop stars
hold concerts and the Pope prays
for the afflicted. This is a cycle that
has repeated itself many a time:
Ethiopia, Somalia and Rwanda, to
name just a few.
Apart from emergency aid,
developing countries are constantly
receiving aid from richer nations
and organisations such as the
World Bank and the IMF. Since the
1 970s, poor nations have been
receiving loans and grants amounting
to trillions of dollars. Primarily this
money is intended for development
and growth, but has this growth
materialised? Definitely not. The
Third World countries have devel-
oped a 'dependency culture'; they
have become addicted to aid.
The IMF's common prescrip-
tions for ailing economies is now
working. Reducing government
employees, devaluating currencies
and cutting imports, only bring
about unemployment, civil strife
and the creation of trade barriers.
What developing and underdevel-
oped countries need is investment
and genuine guidance. Developed
nations should lift trade barriers
imposed on agricultural and raw
materials produced in poorer coun-
tries. This may sound easier said
that done, but it seems quite illogi-
cal and unfair that prices for com-
modities produced in the develop-
ing countries should be determined
in spot markets in London or New
York. Essentially, the buyer deter-
mines the price, a dream for all
consumers!
Rich, arms producing countries
must stop arming these poor
nations. Military expenditure in
some African countries is as high
as 40% of their national budgets.
Billions of dollars are poured into
huge military arsenals whilst their
towns and cities lack basic facilities.
Third World countries do not need
armies - the world's two strongest
economies, Germany and Japan
have shown just that. The Third
World does not need aid and pity,
what they need is free trade, arms
embargoes and freedom that can
be achieved by the West stopping
the propping of despotic tyrants
and dictators.
"What develop-
ing countries
need is genuine
guidance..."
These problems seem far
away but they are closer to home
than may appear, because the
widening gap between First and
Third Worlds puts migratory pres-
sures on Europe that can shake the
peace, harmony and prosperity
that one seems to take for granted.
