Us in the NUS?
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Imperial students will not re-
affiliate with the National Union
of Students (NUS) according to a
chemistry department survey
carried out last week.
Miles Ambler, Departmental
Representative for chemistry, has
organised a preliminary survey
of lst and 2nd year chemists to
establish the level of support for
a referendum on the issue. When
asked whether Imperial should
join the N U S , only 27%
responded positively.
In a survey which also tried
to gauge the levels of
involvement and interest that
students show for Union issues
in general, it was notable that
over a third of students could not
name their Union President.
Interestingly, those who felt
most strongly that ICU should
retain its independence seemed
to be the best informed, and were
the most likely to attend Union
General Meetings.
Explaining his motives for
organising the survey, M r
Ambler said, "I didn't want
people to have to vote in a
referendum when they were
unaware of the advantages and
disadvantages involved." He says
he wanted to heighten awareness
of the issue and find out how
much students knew of the
implications of joining the NUS.
Describing the NUS as
'discredited', he said that it was
generally accepted as being
socialist, and, "doesn't accurately
reflect the middle-class
Liberal/Tory attitude of the
average Imperial student".
Lucy Chothia, I C U
President, said that she was glad
to get feedback on the issue. She
emphasised that she didn't want
to pressurise students into
rejoining the NUS, but felt that
students had the right to be
informed. Ms Chothia has said
that she will research the final
costs and present the arguments
for and against affiliation to
students if there is sufficient
demand.
The survey comes in the
same week that the Union
General Meeting voted to enter
into dialogue with the NUS in
order to, "discuss the pos-
sibilities of membership of ICU
or its Constituent College
Unions". The proposer, John
Sinner, believes that present
members should have the right
to decide whether Imperial
College Union returns to the
NUS or not. He added that
present students have not
debated the issue and should be
given the chance to do so.
News Review
December
The month of festivities saw nasty assaults, nea
poverty for students and so far not much else!
Interest increased in mascotry with raids on bot
Queen Mary and Westfield and King's Colleges
by the Royal College of Science Union Mascotry
team. Worryingly, fears that a university
education may become only a pursuit of the we
heeled begin to arise.
F E L I X 1 Q 1 4
Students fearing increasing hardship were told that the level of tuition
fees would be frozen this year. But a reduction in the number of people
going to university was planned and the grants were cut by a further
8%. Four Union Stewards required hospital treatment following a
brawl in Beit Quad. Controversy arose over Imperial College Security's
role in the incident. A further fracas occurred in the Mathematics
Library when a fight broke out between a current and an ex-student.
In a more docile battle, following continued complaints from residents
of 169 Queens Gate, it was suggested that the pedestrian gates on
Imperial College Road may close at night. The residents had
complained of damage to cars and 'general horsing around.'

An Escalation of Arms?
Walking out of the quad last
Friday night, I noticed the new
Showsec security guys on the
gate. They are huge and no doubt
quite a deterrent to those think-
ing of spoiling another's evening
out. But are they necessary?
With the events of the dis-
turbance on the 2nd December
still very fresh in many peoples'
minds, the obvious answer is 'yes'.
After all, the stewards lacked the
firepower to subdue or restrain
the assailants, right? That may be
true, but it is worth considering
what their role is (or should be).
I was talking to an old time
member of ICU who was saying
that four years ago there was only
one 'duty officer' in charge on
Wednesday and Friday nights.
S/he was given responsibility by
the appropriate Sabbatical to
ensure the Bars closed, that
everyone left the building, and
while keeping a low profile, to
sort out any problems that may
have arisen. Any serious problem
meant calling security or the
police. Cards were not checked on
entrance to the Union, so any
number of students (or anyone
else) could enter unaccounted.
The situation was reviewed
after a serious incident involving
a duty officer. Card checking was
brought in and in the years that
followed the number of student
staff (now known as stewards) on
duty increased to current levels.
The old black jumper of the duty
officer was replaced with the
bright yellow uniforms currently
used. And now people appear to
be being 'escorted' from the quad
with greater frequency. The role
has become a high profile one.
I have no doubt that those
people removed were being
obnoxious or worse. But the idea
that students can act in such a
'policing' manner seems
dangerous. The same students
who are meeting in lectures and
competing in football matches are
forced into a relationship of
Authority vs Miscreant. And with
two or three stewards supporting
the one who 'confronts' an
undesirable, (who probably saw
people being removed the week
before) can the situation be
anything but charged?
It is a difficult situation,
that's certain. But in the long run,
maybe increasing the muscle on
hand only puts more burden on
those at the front, those most
vulnerable, the stewards.
Thank You...
To everyone who was involved in
producing and printing this issue
over-bitten issue. Merry Xmas, I
look forward to another fun term!
