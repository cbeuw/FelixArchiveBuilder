'So what's the message
we give to the world?
That HIV does not
cause AIDS?"
result of recreational or medical drug use
impairing the immune systems. He means
drugs such as cocaine, L S D , speed and
poppers. He claims this is why the disease is
so common among young people, drug users
and gay men.
He's not the only one with this view.
Dr Fabio Pranchi, an Italian specialist in pre-
ventative medicine,
also believes the
misuse of drugs is to
blame. Michael
Ellner, president of
Health Education
AIDS Liaison
(HEAL), thinks, that
informing people that
they are HIV-positive causes constant terror,
and programming to get sick and die. He
thinks long-term drug use is far more likely
to be involved than a germ. Dr Lawrence
Bradford, a colleague of Duesberg, is also a
fan of the recreational drugs theory, together
with multiple infections, exposure to blood
products and autoimmunity.
Others believe HIV may have a role in
AIDS - though not the suggested one. Dr
Steven Jonas from the State University of
New York believes that HIV plays a part. "It
is necessary, but not sufficient."
This view is shared by Kary Mullis. He
believes that AIDS is caused by an enormous
level of exposure to viruses and bacteria.
Every day we come into contact with millions
of viruses and bacteria. They enter and live
inside our bodies for varying lengths of time.
Some make us ill; most we know nothing
about. The level of these foreign organisms
may accumulate over time, so that after, say,
10 years, we have a tidy collection of tens of
thousands of viruses. There may be a
threshold level at which there are too many
around for our bodies to cope with.
Viruses other than HIV may start to
attack the immune system. Maybe HIV's
presence is coincidental, and it happens to be
the only virus we are testing for. The real
culprit goes undetected and HIV becomes the
scapegoat. It's possible, and as a theory it
definitely holds water.
A different theory, put forward by
Harvey Bialy, another journal editor, insists
that AIDS in Africa can be attributed to
decline in health care, poor sanitation,
economic decline and the development of
drug-resistant infections. HIV may just be an
'entity of convenience', which meets the
needs of researchers. Its effects are easier to
investigate than those of political, economic
and social problems. Many
scientists involved in the
debate are concerned that
while it is becoming
increasingly clear that
factors other than HIV
must be involved in AIDS,
funded research
concentrates purely on
HIV.
Dr Alfred Hassig, director of a Swiss
blood transfusion lab, thinks that multiple
stresses on the immune system provoke an
acute reaction. This allows latent microbes,
including HIV, to start attacking. He believes
dietary measures can reverse the process.
So what's the message we give to the
world? That HIV does not cause AIDS? Then
what? Shares in Durex will plummet. We
might revert from safer sex to safe sex. Even
back to good ole plain sex.
You've spent the evening with Mr X at
a party. He's gorgeous,
with a top personality
and a sharp wit. He
tells you he's HIV-
positive. Do you sleep
with him? Even using
a condom? It's all very
well for the sceptics to
say that HIV is not
involved but there's
still a nagging thought
in the back of your
mind as you peel off
each other's underwear.
It taps on your shoulderblade and whispers
through your earwax that there must be a
good reason why all those scientists were
convinced for over a decade that HIV was the
culprit. $3 billion of research, $3 billion of
research.
If they're not sure about the link
"Your dilemma is sex
with an HIV-positive
man. The rest ofthe
evening may end shortly
with cold shoulders and
cold showers..."
between HIV and AIDS, what about the link
between H I V and sex? Is it definitely
sexually transmitted? Infection with HIV
does appear to happen when a person has
unprotected sex. However, scientists have
been unable to find any live HIV in semen.
Surely if HIV were transmitted in this way,
masses of it would be around. A substantial
amount of HIV would be needed to have any
effect on the recipient of the sperm.
It must be very frustrating to know that
for HIV to be sexually transmitted it must be
in semen. And yet it can't be found. Maybe
we are looking for the wrong thing. So what
did we decide about the sex? Give it a miss or
carry on regardless? The frustration of the
scientists will pale in comparison to your own
if you don't decide soon.
I'm assuming here that you'll be
attracted to Mr X in the first place. This
makes you either a heterosexual woman or a
homosexual man. Your dilemma is sex with
an HIV-positive man. What about the other
way round: an HIV-positive woman? Your
risk assessment this time is slightly different.
Female to male transmission of HIV occurs at
an extremely low rate. The risk is much
smaller. Woman to woman transfer occurs at
an even lower rate.
What's the decision? In most cases the
very stigma and
associations of HIV are
going to put you off
before you go anywhere
near the underside of
his/her duvet. The rest
of the evening may end
shortly with cold
shoulders and cold
showers. You're as
politically correct as the
next person, but
putting your life on the
line is just not sensible.
The rebel scientists could be right, but
they could equally well be wrong. How would
you feel if you ignored all the safer sex advice
and someone proved that HIV was the cause?
For the time being, the blanket advice of
don't do anything with anyone is definitely
the safest. Q
