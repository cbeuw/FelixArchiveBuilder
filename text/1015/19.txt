L COLLEGE UNION MEMBERSHIP AND OPTING OUT
Since the time of its establishment, it has been the practice to regard all
registered students of Imperial College as members of the Impeial College
Union. The same arrangement has applied to the constituent college unions.
There has been no subscription fee charged to the students or their students
to secure membership.The college has funded ICU and the CCUs to enable the
provision of a range of services and facilities for students - sorting, cultural,
recreational etc - and students have been free to use or not use these services as
they individually decided.
However, under the provisions of the Education Act 1 994 the college is
specifically obliged to make provision for students to opt out of membership of
Student Unions.
Moreover the college is charged with ensuring that any student who
exercises the right to opt out should not be "unfairly disadvantaged" with regard
to accessing services and facilities available to the rest of the student body.
In order to comply with this requirement, the college has agreed with ICU
that ICU will act as the college "agent" in the provision of facilities and services
for all our registered students. The college will continue to fund ICU and the
CCUs on the traditional basis so that the normal provision of services and
facilities is available to all registered students irrespective of whether they have
formally opted out of union membership or not.
The only practical effect therefore of opting out will be that such students
cannot stand for elected office or take part in Union elections.
For this purpose the college needs to know and to keep a record of students
who have opted out.
Thus all registered students who wish to exercise their rights under the
Education Act 1 994 of formally opting out of ICU and C C U membership for the
session 1 994-5 are required to come to the registry (Room 343 on level 3 of the
Sherfield Building) by monday 9 January 1 995 (the beginning of the spring
term) to record their decision.

IC/Mary's women, and with six
in the top eight, the women
dominated the race, winning first
and second team.
The men gave a solid
performance (team position
unknown as yet) and seventh
place by Andy puts him in with a
good chance of selection for the
BUSA championships, along
with most of the IC women.

IC Ladies vs Sussex University
On a cold wet December day, the
Ladies badminton team trudged
to windy Brighton for their first
UAU knockout match against
Sussex University. With a
depleted squad of only 4, it meant
that we were 3-0 down before the
first shuttle was smashed.
The games started with both
sides showing fighting
determination. Barbara and
Elaine pushed aside their best
twosome after a closely fought
first few points. However the
match was almost in crisis when
the pair, suffering from fatigue,
took their second pair to a close
3rd game. Wendy and Claire
stormed through all three of their
matches, even though Wendy
hadn't played for 7 months.
Soon Sussex dropped their
heads and their form died.
Barbara and Elaine dealt the
final blow with a 15-0, 15-0
trashing of their weakest pair.
Onward to round 2 in 1995,
still undefeated.

10-0 win. Sod off all those who
thought that we would never win
a match. Well, we can and we
did, even if it did take us three
years! Congrats to Lynsey who
scored the first try and Mel and
Shuggy who scored the second.
Forward of the match was Jane
and back of the match was Emma
D. Well done all of you. We can
do it again and again and again!
IC ladies vs London University 0
After a storming 10-0 win on
Sunday, IC Virgins followed up
with another brilliant show of
skill. The score this time was 30-
0. Try scores were Shuggy,
Lynsay, Jo, Mel and Cathy
who scored 2, and was
later named "Woman of
the Match". Back of the
match was Emma B.
and forward of the
match was
Caroline, using
her fear
inducing
technique.
We've done it again!!!
Congratulations to all who played
and thanks to the supporters.
Keep up the great work!!

ICvs Goldsmiths
After St Georges conceded defeat
before the match on Saturday,
and a win by default on the
previous Wednesday, we were
keen to actually play a match,
although the cold and wet did
dampen the enthusiasm. The
first quarter was closely contested
with both teams eager to make a
good start. Goldsmiths were out
for revenge for their defeat earlier
this season, but IC soon settled
and begun to build up a slender
lead. A big team change at half
time meant that fresh players
could continue to extend our
lead, forcing lots of inaccurate
passing on their part (until we
were comfortably ahead). Thanks
to everyone who has played this
term. Let's try to carry on our
eight-match unbeaten record
next year!
