A WOMAN LOOKS AT I.C.
A recent article i n Sennet indicated that the
young ladies of Bedford and Westfield on thair
own admission worked harder than their counter-
parts at U.C. and King's. I f this, as would seem
to he the case, i s directly related to the ratio
of men to women i n the college, I.C.W.A. theoret-
i c a l l y do no work at a l l . Fortunately this i s not
the case, and i n fact they have to study hard i n
order to "keep their end upV against not incon-
siderable competition.
In the words of a well-known quotation,hovever,|
" i t a l l depends on what you mean by" - work. The
odd jobs they are called upon to do i s out of a l l
proportion to their members, and they are, as a
rule, very willing to turn their hands to any
sort of work which the men i n their wisdom think
could be done better by the ladies. Thay provide
an active female element i n a l l the clubs which
require a mixed membership (not to mention soma
that do not), and i n addition run teams for most
sports, not to mention organising their own exc-
lusive social functions.
Much of the social l i f e of the College depends
therefore on the support of the women and aach
one has to bear an active part i n several dif-
ferent social and athletic societies. Unfor-
tunately, out of the sixty or more members of
I.C.W.A. only about half do take an active part
in extra-academic l i f e , and pressure f a l l s even
more heavily on the willing shoulders of the
other half. Surely every ICWArlan realised before
she arrived that she would be well i n the minority'
at I.C. and and should have been prepared to take!
a f u l l part i n the social l i f e of the College witb{
out which no university education i s complete.
This criticism has often been levelled at the men
as well as the women, but i n a college the size
of I.C. the male contingent can afford to carry
a few passengers, but I.C.W.A. CANNOT and i t
should be the privilege as well as the duty of
every member of I.C.W.A. to take advantage of her
unique position i n the College.
In this way the Women's Association could
become a force to be reckoned with i n the Union
which would be disproportionate to i t s size, and
those who complain that women'a interests i n the
College are neglected would, by their support of
meetings and other activities, be instrumental i n
rectifying this situation.

STAG PARTY STOMP
So far as I was concerned this function was
a great success, i f only because I had the grat-
ification of seeing men being the wallflowers
for oncei
Biased as I am, I can only give a personal
account of the evening. I am no connoisseur of
jazz, but I thought the playing of both the I.C.
Jazz Band and Bobby Mlckleburgh and his Bobcats
excellent. For the men who had to s i t out because
of the lack of g i r l s i t seemed no great hardship
for them to have to s i t and listen, indeed many
of them seemed to prefer i t that way.
It was unfortunate that the hop coincided
with the combined performance of the Musical
and Dramatic Societies, and this probably
accounted for the absence of I.C.W.A. Being
their only representative present, I can
assure them that i t was a function well worth
attending - i f one i s prepared to pay the price
of being a physical wreck fo the next few days.

ANY SUGGESTIONS?
On January 9th. or thir year the f i r s t
informal dance was held i n the Concert Hall by
the I.C.U. Entertainments Committee, and since
that date a further seven dances have been
held there.
Tne hop -requenters i n the College w i l l
have realized that none of these have followed
the old style of the "Bob-hops" with dancing to
records only. Instead, dancing has alwaya been
to a band, and the price of admission has been
2/-. Even so the I.C. dances are s t i l l anongst
the cheapest in the University.
Although the attendance at the Saturday
night hops has increased i reatly over the past
few months, the Entertainments Committee i s the
f i r s t to realize that there i s always plenty of
room for improvement. However, without your
help we cannot make these improvements for It
is upon your criticism and advice that we must
base our hop policy. We are here to give you,
the members of I.C., the kind of hops that you
want, so I am asking you today to put yourself
in our shoes for five minutes and decide what,
i f any, alterations you would make to the hops.
Write your suggestions down on paper and post
them to Richard H.T. Garnett through the Union,
Hostel, of the Mines letter rack, R . H . T . C .
