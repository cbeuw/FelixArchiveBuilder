Over a hundred people, some from warmer
regions, f i l l e d the gaily decorated Concert
Hall l a s t Friday, when the International
Relations Club held a successful I t a l i a n
Evening. The meeting began with I t a l i a n wine
drunk to the axsccmpaniment of songs of I t a l -
ian origin. The programme included the
showing of two films, one a h i s t o r i c a l docu-
mentary on the l i f e of a Roman baker, the
other a travel film with an I t a l i a n commen-
tary showing the beauty of the countryside,
this was unfortunately marred by the poor
quality of the print. These were followed
by an interesting talk by Signer Donini of
the I t a l i a n Institute of Culture on the
economic and p o l i t i c a l problems of Italy -
housing, overpopulation and emigration. A
choir of I t a l i a n ladies i n regional costumes .
ably assisted by Eric Warwicker on the piano,
then sang a few gay songs giving the feeling
of I t a l i a n v i t a l i t y and joy of l i f e . Then
came a long interval
and spaghetti were consumed to more music.
The choir then gave us more I t a l i a n songs
u n t i l Union hours forced the closure of the
proceedings.

the A i r Squadron, observed t h i s , and
moved from c e n t r e t h r e e - q u a r t e r t o
second row forward. T h e r e a f t e r p l a y
became even more scrappy.
The p l a y was w i t n e s s e d by B.Hearn,
