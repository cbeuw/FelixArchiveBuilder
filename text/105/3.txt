VIEWS ON VIEWPOINTS
This week, FELIX received a viewpoint which
many people would consider political i n nature.
FELIX i s essentially non-political and non-
religious, as i s Imperial College Union, and as
a question of policy was thought to be at stake,
an Editorial Board meeting was called. At the
Board meeting i t was decided that the columns of
FELIX should be open to views on anything which
primarily concerns students, including views on
political and religious topics - provided that
FELIX i t s e l f did not express an opinion, and
that writers' names were published as well.
Each case, i t was thought, i f of a p o l i t i c a l or
religious nature, should be considered on i t s
own merits.
The particular viewpoint i n question, the
Board thought, did not have as i t s basic subject
a topic that primarily commented on student l i f e ,
and therefore we have not printed i t .
With the above reservations, controversial
viewpoints on a l l topics - even Editorials - are
always welcome. FELIX wishes to make i t clear,
however, that writers'-
views do not necessarily
coincide with i t s own or those of the Union, and
each writer's name must be published i n f u l l .
We congratulate Mr. save Briggs of Maths. 1
on being the only person to point out to us last
week's "deliberate mistake. " What i s i t ?

"Dear S i i
What i s happening to the I.C. Student?
Several representatives from Industry have
expressed grave concern about the type of
person who graduates here and claim that the
present student has but too narrow an outlook
on l i f e .
Who i s to blame for this state of affairs?
I find i t very hard to believe that a l l the
students here are turning into brown baggers.
The fault must l i e i n the fact that the courses
here are far too f u l l and have reached the
stage of becoming ridiculous. Because a few
people tchoose to work to the exclusion of
everything else, i t i s nonsensical for the staff
to take their amount of work as a standard for
everyone else. Indeed most students, are now
being discouraged by the staff from Joining
any I.C.. Club or Society at a l l ! !
What we must have i s a cut and dried total
of work which has to be done i n order to obtain
the necessary degree marks, but at the same time
the student should be allowed sufficient leeway
in order to broaden his outlook. I t has been
suggested that the college,particularly the
drawing office, should be closed on a Wednesday
afternoon. This would allow more people to
participate i n college activities, but would
curb the opportunities of these people who
really want to work and gain extra credit.
If the present situation i s allowed t o
continue we may as well disband the Unions, turn
v
.he new Union Building into a mass of lecture
rooms, and rename the College "The Imperial
Technical College".

Dear S i r ,
Tour "Yiewpoint" i n the last but one
issue prompts me to beg space to comment. Per-
haps f i r s t I may be permitted to thank the
author for an unexpected compliment,' i f I knew
the gentleman I might be tempted to buy him a
drink.
To a considerable extent Mr. Dixon's obser-
vations are valid, although I beg to differ on
a couple of points. In the f i r s t place I doubt
i f i t i a true that many of I.C.'s individual
participants i n U.L. affairs feel they have
been driven away - this certainly did not happen
to me. Indeed, my connection with U.L. came
about through I.C. Soccer Club when i t had 5
regular members of the University XI. (in the
last and only cup winning season) and although
now I am unable to participate actively i n the
I.C. Club, for a long time J. found a middle
way of contributing to both.
Secondly, the assumption that "the chief
function of U.L.U. i s to organise inter-Col-
legiate sport" i s quite wrong. Whilst this may
be true to a greater extent for other activities,
on the athletic side the primary concern of
U.L.U. i s to field teams representing the Uni-
versity, and here the operative principle Is
the whole and not part of i t l Too few realise
that a University i s a body of considerable
influence by i t s very nature, and this i s sup-
plemented by practically a l l of U.L. sport
being senior In status, and some of i t inter-
national. There i s nowhere else where a sports-
man can more easily play too way to being under
the eyes of Selectors; I f only players could
realise i t and having done so, do something
about I t (and get a degree) their future i s
assured. This might well be worth consideration
at a time when rather more sausages i n ident-
i c a l skins are to be turned-out of our South
Kensington factory.
We might also ponder upon whether winning,
which i s synonymous with success, I S also synon-
ymous with progress, and whether i t i s really
true that there i s a Union and Hostel "elite
of untouchables". Some unfortunate has to be
a Union officer and may want to live i n the
Hostel, but few would care to do so i f I t war*
widely accepted that a slur was associated
with this status. Why doesn't someone expose
the self-made "mystery" of tha Hostel Selection
process and scotch the pretenders who feel that
they hold the key to an individuals ability to
aucceed or f a l l with his application? Having
done so, then the most active body i n the Union
might wall be prepared to be lass clandestine In
their efforta to seek a broader University ed-
ucation by participation both at Kensington
and Bloomsbury, Harlington and Motspur Park.

The paths have been laid out i n tb*
true British s p i r i t of compromise; with
so many conflicting interest* at heart
the designers have provided only one
direct route acroa* the lawn.,
Dear S i r ,
saving read tne viewpoint i n tha last but on*
issue, concerning the position of I.C. as a uni-
versity college, I feel that son* aspects of the
problem have been omitted, giving * rather dis-
torted picture.
Certainly I.C. i s onesided, though I believe
that a largely technological college produce*
more acceptable members of tha community than
a predominantly arte college. Certainly, mora
women at the college would be a good thing,
both for I.C.V.A. and the 'sexually starved
neurotics', as I.C.'s men were described In
•Felix' by one young lady. Incidentally nobody
has yet written a letter refuting this descrip-
tion.
However, with over two thousand students,
Imperial Collage, together with two or three
other colleges i n the University, i s comparable
in size with many provincial universities, and
i s big enough to be largely self-contained with
respect to University activities. Apart from i t a
mixed membership U.L.U. Is comparable i n many
ways to the union* of the major colleges; and
I wonder, for example, bow many people i n tha
University knew the name of the U.L.U.President
before the advent of) 'Sennet'.
The University of London Is unique, became*
of i t s size and the wide separation of many of
the colleges, and hence U.L.U. i s also a unique
Institution whose functiSns should be Just those
with which the college unions cannot adequately
deal. This should include the organisation of
Intercollege activities catering for minority
interests, providing union f a c i l i t i e s for tha
smaller colleges, and a meeting place
for students of different faculties where this
cannot be achieved i n the college concerned, e.g.
at I.C. and many of the medical schools.
Regarding "the restrictive attitude of tb*
Union e l i t e " , I think I t i s almost inevitable
that with so l i t t l e hostel accommodation, and
the existence of th* '22', Links, Chaps, and
other clubs, a cliquish attitude w i l l exist,
although this i n i t s e l f i s not overmuch to worry
about sine* any "potential leaders" i n the col-
lege are unlikely to concern themselves exclu-
sively with such cliques. I t i s perhaps relevant
to quote here the words of on* renowned bcer-
swiller who complained " i f you are one of tb*
boy* and you get drunk - you're a good chap,
but I f you're not one of the boys and you've
had too much to drink, then you're a drunken
Idlotl"
Perhaps the greatest fault with I.C. i s that
i t Is the. *agree that matter* and not tha univ-
ersity education so that there are not enough
people who cut. afford to wast* (academically)
their t i n * at collage. However I believe that
anybody who really wants a university education
can get i t at Imperial Collag*.
