SINGE THE 1ST. OCTOBER THIS SESSION, LARGE QUANTITIES OF CROCKERY AND CUTLERY HAVE
DISAPPEARED FROM THE REFECTORY: 250 LARGE KNIVES, 1L0 SMALL KNIVES, 180 DESSERT SPOONS,
130 teaspoons, 80 large forks and 570 oups. Mr.
Henry, the Seourity Officer, was of the opinion,'
that by f a r the majority of the missing
articles would be accounted f o r by people
borrowing., but forgetting t o return them.
He suggested that a search i n the Hostel
might bring to light vast quantities of
Mooney merchandise a3 hapx^ened when the
Hostel was redecorated last summer. The
Refectory Committee think that the figures
are f a r too high to be accounted for comp-
letely intiriis way, and think that new locks
f i t t e d to the doors w i l l lower the incidence
of p i l f e r i n g . Already many of the reserve
supply intended f o r the third floor refeo-
tory has had to be used.
Elsewhere around the College petty l a r -
cency ha3 been apparent. Favourite haunts
of thieves seem to be the cloakroom
and dressing rooms. One person recently
hast a watch, a wallet, and two pens stolen
from his coat which war. l e f t i n the chang-
ing rooms whilst he was training) i n the Park,
/mother had his watch taken from the pocket
of a coat l e f t i n a cloakroom during a hop.
Several cases of theft have been known from
the squash courts. A l l suoh thefts should
be reported t o Mr. Henry.
More serious thefts have ocourred about
the College of late. Arrests have been
made im a number o f cases. The c u l p r i t
who, posing as a Ministry of Works workman,
stole copper cables from Dr. Latham's
laboratory i n the Physics Dept., was appre-
hended; three weeks ago, a thief was
caught red-handed stealing lead at the
back of R.0.S, by Mr-. Henry, who was a i d -
ed by some Ministry of Works workmen.
I t would help i f owners of property
kept temptation out of the misdoer's way
by keeping a oloeermwuard on there be-
longings, keeping tair, under look and key
whenever possible- *- rSfteed, i t i s sometimes
d i f f i c u l t t o t e l l whether the property has
been lost or stolen.
A tribute t o the efficAenoy of the
Security Officer i s the fact that, can-
pared with thebsize of the College, the
ino&awaoe of larceny i s remarkably low.

TOUCHSTONE WEEKEND
At the Touchstone meeting last, weekend the
guest speaker was Mrs. J . Robinson, reader i n
economics at the University of Cambridge, and i n
her opening talk dealt mainly with the predictions)
made by Marx regarding- the class straggle. He had
predicted that as a country developed the smaller
businesses would go out of existence u n t i l the
industry cf the oountry would be run by a r e l a t -
ively few combines and wiopeliem. Side by side
with this Marx predicted growing misery among the
working olasses and growing conflict between
employers and employed u n t i l the workers, l e d By
the trade unions revolted and took over the
industries after they had been f u l l y developed
by the c a p i t a l i s t s .
Although in. many Marx was proved to be oorreolS The Dramatic and. ilusiaal Societies com-
he considerably overestimated the intensity of the]
class struggle. This i n turn, was largely due to
underestimating the bargaining power of the trade
unions and tha mere enlightened attitude of the
employers,while also he d i d not realise that as
companies grow, their ownership would become more
and more diffuse although their control would l i e
i n the hands of a few.
A seoond way In which Marx's had proved
incorrect was that i n those countries where
Communism had been adopted, the Industries were
usually underdeveloped, end i t was l e f t to the
Communist system to develop the industries rapidljq
at the expense of the workers' standard of livings
I t had also t o be remembered,however, over a much
longer period a great deal of misery had been
caused i n other countries by c a p i t a l i s t develop*
ment. The Communist countries had the great

bined to produce a double b i l l i n the Con-
cert Hall last Tuesday and Wednesday.
The f i r s t half of the evening was dev-
oted to the Dram. Soc's production of Mol'
lore's farce 'Sganarelle' which had prev-
iously received second place i n U.L.'s One
Act Play Festival. I t was s k i l l f u l l y pro-
duced by Miss Barbara Russell. Although
the play has not benefited by translation,
and the plot has i t s slow moments, the comp-
lications are smoothed out by the nurse i n
the person of Noelane, and a l l ends happily.
Mr. Terry Wright must be singled out
from a competent cast f o r his inspired
portrayal of Sganarelle and Mr. Roger Nes-
b i t t as the valet showed from his perfor-
mance that he might well become a good
character actor.
The Musical Soo., presented Gilbert
and Sullivan's 'Trial by Jury' under the
direction of their conductor Mr. Frank
Kennard. The orchestra gave an able per-
formance, especially when they had singers
to back them up, but although the Jurymen
sang strongly and obviously enjoyed them-
selves, some of the subtleties cf Gilbert
and Sullivan's particular blend of music
and wit were lost through occasional lack
of enunciation.
However, Mr. Stafford Dean as the Usher
soon brought the audience into touch with
what was happening and the bridesmaids made
a pretty picture daneim their way rrace-
f u l l y round a rather crowded stage. Among
the principals fromR.C.M. Â»ho 30 kindly
helped us out, I.liss Wendy Baldwin was enc-
hanting as the P l a i n t i f f , and together with
Mr. Donald Franoke, who gave a boisterous
and spirited a i r to the learned Judge, sent
the performance sparkling on i t s way; Mr.
G. Upyd as the defendant had a pleasing
voice and Counsel for the P l a i n t i f f , Mr.
I. Partridge pleaded very persuasively on
his client's behalf.
The make-up and decor deserve special
mention and i t i s clear from this varied
programme that I.C. has a high standard
of non-scientific a c t i v i t i e s . A great
deal of hard work must have been put into
both productions and thanks should be given
to everyone concerned.
