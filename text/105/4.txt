The above photograph i s familiar
to most|of the students at I.C. for i n
her f i r s t term here Judy Kornbluth firmly
established herself as the leading lady
i n the Dramatic Society, and consequently
her photograph has frequently adorned
College notice boards . Since then she
has f u l f i l l e d t h i s r o l l with such success
that im last term's produotion of "Loftur"
she was rewarded with some complimentary
words i n The Times.
Judy also plays a loading role i n
sport, representing I.U.W.S.C. at
badminton, tennis, table tennis, hockey
and swimming, and i s now learning to
play squash.S n e n a s e v e n umpireda rugger
matoh i n Hyde Park.
Although Dram. Soo. and sport take
up most of her time, Judy s t i l l has time
to be Secretary of the Jewish Society,
Secretary of the R.C.S. Journal, and to
make typing errors i n F e l i x .
Her likes include olassioal (nusic,
t r a d i t i o n a l jazz, hiking, boats and open
sports oars. She prefers men with
a good sense of humour and some intelligence
(especially i f they are t a l l and good
looking).
She dislikes 52 buses that hide behind
75 buses and then whizz past the Albert
Hall, people who don't l e t her read their
papers i n the Tube during rush hours(or at
any time), peroxide, and having her feet
sprayed with water from p l a s t i c wash bottles.
Although most of her time i s taken
up with sooial and athletic a c t i v i t i e s her
academic achievements are quite con-
siderable. She has been offered a place
at Cambridge for a post-graduate course
next year, and we wish her every success
there.

Many students w i l l be familiar with
Dam's Tea-Bar i n the Imperial Institute,
and the route from the tea-bar to the
Union v i a the basement. Few w i l l know of
the vast network of tunnels interconnecting
the various parts of the College, with
the Imperial Institute as the fooal
point. For some time now, oertain per-
sons have oarrxed out investigations into
the f a c i l i t i e s ; this a r t i o l e i s a report
of t h e i r findings to date, rurtnec i-esearoh
i s proceeding with the D,I,C, i n mind
A route useful in.wet weather has been
thoughtfully provided by the Ministry c f
Works f o r R.C.S. types. Students wishing
to follow this route are advised to start
from the Institute basement, best appro-
ached from the back exit of the tea-bar.
Once i n the; basement, head i n the direct-
ion of R.C.S., but take care not to turn
sharp l e f t , otherwise one w i l l enter a
long pul-de-sao, oharaoteristioally
terminated by a jumbo-sise gas meter.
Proceeding southwards under Imperial
Institute Road, one arrives under the
R.C.S. i n a maze of steam pipes
where the a i r temperature i s rather high
(120F). From here one may turn l e f t ,
and after negotiating a seoond passage,
oan climb {exhausted into the college
basement. (Bogey;, time for journey;«3.5 '
minj
The mere adventurous oan follow
this passage to i t s end, where we nave
discovered some subterranean vaults
containing oertain machinery of great
interest to Engineers with an h i s t o r i c a l
bent. This oonsists of a great fan wheel,
(not driven by steam.). Warning: A false
step here and yiau w i l l f i n d yourself i n
the G-.P.01. This route may be useful f o r
students b^red by postal work i n the
vacation.
The ventilation machinery i s matched
by a similar contraption at the other end
of the College. A long t i l e d tunnel con-
nects the two, and also provides M I es-
cape route from many rooms and labora-
tories i n th<" R.C.S. basement.
Returni.-0 to the Institute, mention
must be made of the watohman-proof
route from i t s basement to the central
tower, and thence to the rest of t h i s
gem of the golden age of Architecture.
An indoor track, v i a the Warburg I n s t i -
tute, permits ascent of one of the
smaller towers, from whioh a good view
of Imperiania may be obtained, although,
this panorama i s surpassed by the superb
view from the top of the Coloutt Tower.
From the Institute basement one i s
advised to return to the Union at
ground l e v e l , owing to the hazards of
encountering attendants i n the Institute
b o i l e r house, although fellow Miners
may minimize travel at t h i s l e v e l by a
deviation under the Chemical Engineering
Department. Owing to the heat this l a t t e r
portion i s suitable only f o r thin ex-
plorers clad i n their oldest clothes.
Formerly a tunnel l e d from the Chem •
Eng.boiler house- to the Albert Hall. We
regret that t h i s i s no longer usable on
Chelsea Arts B a l l nights, as the tunnel
i s blooked by a wall under the road.
This prevented investigation of the "Un-
exploded-bomb-under-the-Albert -Hall-
steps" myth, but Botanists can note a
means of returning surreptitiously to
their department by this route. This
passage oontains oertain s o i e n t i f i c
apparatus o r i g i n a l l y i n the 1851
exhibition and last used by one of us
i n a research project.
Inmates of the New Hostell Did
you know that below your feet l i e
two vast reservoirs of rather hot
water, as well as a further system of
tunnels? Interest i n these burrows i s
liable to wane, as f o r the most part
these passageways are only about 2 j f t .
high, and tend to become unpleasant as
the kitchens are approached. Only
Mooney oan explain this.
We have been asjeed to withold
information on the route providing an
aooess to the Bar during closed hours.
Many exhibits of interest to the
professional taxidermist exist under
the Hideous History Museum. There i s
also a short out from R.C.S. to S. Ken
station.
Rumour has i t that a subterranean
route exists from I.C. to the States,
and one of us has gone to the States to.

sored by the D.R.I.S.) . Further refu-
ges are available f o r eaoarw from irate
Professors, Landladies, and other sundry
irri.tationsj a l a t e r a r t i c l e may deal with
these. Finally, we wish a l l explorers
happy hunting, tolerant o f f i c i a l s and
a hot bath after their efforts.
