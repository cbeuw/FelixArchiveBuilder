Henry Sawistowski
Professor Henryk Sawistowski,
who died at his home in London
on 19 December at the age of 59,
had a distinguished career as a
chemical engineer.
He was born in Grudziadz in
Poland in 1925,'and came to this
country in 1946 after service with
the Second Polish Corps of the
British Eighth Army in Italy.
Because of the war, he had no
formal education from the age of
14 until he entered the Polish
University College in London in
1948; he graduated from there in
1952 with first class honours in
chemical engineering. Then
began his lifelong association
with the Department of
Chemical Engineering and
Chemical Technology at
Imperial College, to which he
came in the same year to do
research on mass transfer in
distillation. He joined the staff
two years later as a Demon-
strator, was made a lecturer on
the award of his PhD in 1955,
rising to Senior Lecturer in 1961
and Reader in 1965. The title of
Professor of C h e m i c a l
Engineering was conferred on
him in 1976, and he was elected
Dean of the City and Guilds
College in 1982.
Professor Sawistowski had a
world-wide reputation for his
contributions to research and
education. His name will always
be coupled with advances in our
understanding of mass transfer in
distillation and extraction, and of
interfacial effects at free surfaces.
He was also a brilliant lecturer,
and much in demand as a
distinguished speaker in all parts
of the world. His impressive
research achievements were,
however, almost incidental to a
lifetime dedicated to his College,
education and his profession.
The Institution of Chemical
Engineers this year awarded him
its Arnold Greene Medal for
outstanding service to the
profession over a long period,
particularly in the field of
education and international
relations. He was elected to the
Fellowship of Engineering in
1980.
He always described himself as
a European, and he did much to
strengthen our ties with other
countries in Europe through
service in various European
organisations and his many
informal visits. He was a great
• traveller, and his interests spread
to many other countries beyond
Europe.
Within the College he was a
dedicated teacher. He cared
passionately about his
department, about the structure
and content of its chemical
, engineering course — and he
cared about every single student
who passed through it. Indeed he
was an indispensible part of the
Department's filing system, for
at a moment's notice he could
remember the name, dates,
grades, and subsequent career of
any student graduating over the
last thirty years.
Henry, as he was known
throughout the profession, will
be remembered with great
affection by his many students
and friends all over the world.
Those who have been associated
with him over the past two years
will also retain a deep admiration
of his fortitude and cheerfulness
in coping with a debilitating
illness whose inevitable end he
knew only too well, yet he
retained a lively interest in his
students, his research, and the
affairs of the College until the
very end.
He is survived by his wife
Margaret, and their two
daughters, Elizabeth, an
Imperial graduate, and Joanna, a
present student at the College.
The Editor and staff of FELIX
join with the whole College in
expressing their sincere
condolences to Professor
Sawistowski's family.
Courses
scrapped
The College Board of Studies has
approved plans that will result in
phasing out Joint Honours
courses in Chemistry/Manage-
mecience and Biochemistry/
Management Science. No new
students will be admitted to these
courses from now on.
Dr Levitt, Director of
Undergraduate Studies in
Chemistry, said that although he
was sorry to see the courses
disappear he didn't think it
would be very damaging.
'Students will still be able to do
an MSc in Management Science
after their third year', he said.
'Current students can rest
assured that they will still have
the option of Management
Science in the third year'.
Jane Ryder, RCS academic
affairs officer, said that students
in the Chemistry/Biocemistry
departments were annoyed that
the changes had been
implemented without any
referral to the staff/student
committees.
The cuts are designed to
achieve an overall reduction in
student numbers, to meet agreed
target figures.
UGC visit
The University Grants
Committee ( UGC ) is to visit
Imperial College on February
6th. The UGC is a government
body, chaired by Sir Peter
Swinnerton-Dyer, which advises
the Department of Education
and Science on the allocation of
funds to universities, and the
members of the committee visit
each university every five years.
Imperial College is funded as a
separate body from the
University of London.
While at the College the
committee will be spending time
with the Rector, academic and
welfare staff, and 45 minutes with
student representatives. This
Union delegation includes the
sabbatical officers, academic
affairs officers, and major sub-
committee chairmen.
Ian Bull said that the aim of the
meeting was to show the
members of the committee some
of the problems of being a
student in London, and that in
particular the College needs
more money for accommodation
and sports facilities.
Any student who feels that
they have suggestions for the
meeting should contact Ian Bull
as soon as possible.
