Rector acts on
indecent show
The controversial Mines Hon Porn Night was cancelled on
December 11 last year, only hours before the event was due
to begin. The entertainment was to have included male and
female strippers and pornographic films.
R S M President M i k e
Osbo me decided to abandon
the event after a meeting with the
Rector, Lord Flowers, and Ian
Bull.
The Rector was said to be
concerned about adverse
publicity that the event was
causing the College. A large
number of enquiries had been
received from the National Press.
Despite the Porn Night being
cancelled, about 300 pickets
congregated outside Beit Arch. A
number of them stormed the
gates, which were only open to IC
Union card holders.
The IC WIST group acclaimed
the cancellation of Hon Porn
Night as a notable victory
following their campaign of
opposition to the event.
In an RSMU press release the
RSM Exec claimed that 'it was a.
travesty that the Rector did not
back the students Union, but put
pressure on Mike Osbo rne to
cancel the event'. They pointed
out that an IC UGM had voted to
allow the Porn night to go ahead.
The Rector's opposition to
such events was made clear in his
Welcoming address to Freshers
on October 1. In a thinly veiled
attack on the worst of CCU
excesses, Lord Flowers said 'The
unfortunate fact is that the
College still contains some male
chauvinist pigs. They may
consider themselves fine fellows
as they swagger to their trough,
but the rest of us merely pity
them and are happy to note that
their influence is on the wane'.
Another RSMU event, a South
African barnight, was also
cancelled last term, again after
numerous press enquiries.

Prices up
The rising price of bread has
forced Union snack bar manager
Norman Jardine to raise the price
of a quarter pounder to 70p.
However demand is still rising,
and an increasing number of
academic staff are eating there.
As from Monday smoking has
been banned in the snack-bar
area.
