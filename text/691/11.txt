Self-styled 'Hitler' Graham
Brown has been the cause of
dissent among the ranks of
Consoc recently.
His looney Gestapo-style
rantings embarrass the College
Tories no end, and they always
try to intercept his letters before
they reach the FELIX office.
As well as making a nuisance
of himself at IC (See letters page)
Graham is also making his
presence felt in the Tory Party
and, so he would have us believe,
in the national press.
As Chairman of the Monday
Club Student's Group he
recently issued a press release
about a paper he has co-written
about the subject of student
loans, and called a press
conference to mark its launch.
Unfortunately we cannot be
sure how many reporters
attended since FELIX reporters
were 'too busy' to go, although
we did hear that the Colchester
Trumpeter, Graham's local
paper, featured a story of the
'local boy makes fool of himself
type. However FELIX managed
to scoop what is obviously not
the news story of 1985 when we
printed his Opinion article on
loans last term.
Whoever gets elected as
President next year, it's unlikely
to be J Martin Taylor.
Martin is an agreeable old
duffer but everything he does
turns to disaster, largely due to
his amazing ability at being late.
He was late to finish the Union
Handbook, late to write articles
for FELIX, late to write his bit
for the PG Handbook etc, etc.
He would also, no doubt, be
late handing in his election
manifesto...
