CINEMA
Citv Heat
CITY HEAT is ° - amiable
stroll through the pronmition
era in the company of Burt
Reynolds and Clint Eastwood.
Burt Reynolds plays a
h a p p y - g o - l u c k y private
detective whose partner gets
thrown out of a fourth floor
window when
attempting to
double cross a gangland
hoodlum. Clint Eastwood
plays Clint Eastwood, and
mumbles the lines of a police
Lieutenant who was a buddy
of Burt Reynolds when he was
still in the police force. The
two of them shoot their way
through the film to a very
agreeable sound track of jazz,
swing and ragtime which,
together with what must be
every vintage car in the US,
gives the film an air of 1920's
authenticity. The stars rescue
a total of three women, who
are portrayed as objects
which have to be released
from the clutches of evil
mobsters and/or seduced. In
fact, apart from one gutsy gal
knocKing out athug hy hit+i-iq
him over the head with a vase
in a fight scene only men do
anything except simper in the
antiro fi!jT)
As well as the afore-
mentioned shooting and
rescuing our two heroes also
crack some good one-liners
which provide them wi'ui
something to do while they
load their guns. There are also
a few nice visual gags which
give the film a little extra.
If you want a good night out
without any intellectual
ovetones you could do a lot
worse than seeing City Heat.
It's got vintage action, vintage
laughs and vintage cars, and
provides an evening's
entertainment for anyone who
wants to give their brain a rest.
