victory
Fremantle 3 Benard Sunley 2
The Fremantle team surprised
itself by actually fielding a full
team (plus sub) for the first time
ever. The appearance of these
twelve men in Hawaiian shirts at
the match is even more
surprising when one considers
their state after the Fremantle
beach party the night/morning
before, most of them still being
drunk/hungover/still to go to
bed, and, having walked down
Earls Court Road, only one
stopped for a kebab.
We could tell things were still
going well for the Fremantle
when we won the toss, so we
resisted the temptation to go
down to the Ferret to celebrate,
and the gaine began once Colin
'Samurai' Irwin completed his lap
of honour.
It was a game of two 45 minute
halves, played with a round ball,
punctuated by stoppages due to
a very high foul count. Play
tended to sweep from the
Fremantle end to halfway to BS's
end, and back again, but both
sides had a few chances in the
first half. Andy 'safe as 'ouses'
Reeves, John 'kneecaps' Baxter,
and Kev 'take a man' Gardner
were very solid in the Fremantle
defense, and it was perhaps an
unfair comment on the half that
BS ended it one-nil up.
BS changed two men during
the second half, while the
Fremantle lined up with the same
eleven. However, the forward
line of Lewis 'Rawhide'
Westwick, John 'Sureshot'
Heighway, Hewitt 'legs' Benson
and Colin 'Samurai' Irwin
seemed to have new life, and
having forced a corner, were
delighted to see the BS
goalkeeper tip Kev Gardner's
curling kick over the goalline
with Steve 'Frankie' last and
Simon 'shoulder' Blayney finally
getting their act together
midfield, things were looking up.
Then a good pass let John
Heighway loose, and it was 2-1 to
the Fremantle.
BS responded with increased
pressure, but because they were
actually wearing a proper strip
(with numbers!), the Fremantle,
in their Hawaiian shirts, found it
much easier to organise marking
than BS did. John 'silent one'
Galloway and John 'killer'
Fitzmaurice did Stirling work as
semi defenders/sweepers, but in
the end BS's pressure paid off,
and the game was levelled.
The Fremantle then made a
substitution, bringing on Mike
'swiftfoot' Grimshaw, and letting
Colin Irwin go off and drink his
cans. John Heighway was set
loose once more, and he put the
ball away. The match ended
soon after, and the Fremantles
first ever victory was duly
recorded, despite the fact that
medical reports later established
that the Fremantle team had too
much blood in their alcohol
stream.
Cheers BS for the game, and
you never know, if you'd played
on Hyde Park, you might have
won.

First win
of season
IC v UCL Mixed II
IC, looking for their first win of
the season, were disgusted by
the sight of only four UCL
players. This did mean, though,
that IC only had to take two
games to win the match.
Thanks to fine play from IC the
match was won after the second
game, and the final scoreline was
eight games to one.
