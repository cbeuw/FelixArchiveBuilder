Tamsin Greig is one of my favourite
comediennes. Admittedly, she rare-
ly plays anyone other than a ditzy,
unlucky in love, socially inept and
insecure thirty going on forty year old
woman but I’m fond of her. Earlier in
the year I came up with a list of din-
ner party guests and her quirkiness
makes her most certainly welcome.
Greig first came to my attention
with Black Books, then the crimi-
nally unnoticed Love Soup and most
recently with the second series of
Green Wing which has been a hoot.
The fast-forward, slow-mo direc-
tion has earned Green Wing most of
its notoriety whilst at the same time
polarising opinion. Set in a hospital,
the story follows various employees
as they do very little doctoring and
little much else. Whilst, personally,
I find the direction enhances some
of the comedy, for instance an invis-
ible limbo stick is repeatedly ducked
by office workers whilst the camera
quickens and slows, it’s the charac-
ters’ variety that really succeeds.
The main
plot follows Dr.
Caroline Todd,
played by Greig
and it concerns
a more conven-
tional ‘hard to
get’ romance.
Internet cap-
tion winning
c o n s u l t a n t
r a d i o l o g i s t ,
Alan Statham is perhaps the most rec-
ognisable character; a bumbling, per-
verted, stammering fool disliked by
most of the department for arrogantly
talking convoluted and windy bullshit.
Highlights include adlibbed verbal
tennis with junior doctor Boyce and
an incredibly immature rendition of
the alphabet in a Chinese restaurant.
The best one-liners though are saved
for everyone’s favourite evil bastard,
Dr. Guy Secretan. Instantly quota-
ble retorts include: “Cockspanker”,
“Thimbledick” and “Jizzfountain”.
C’etait Un Rendezvous (Cert. PG)
HIIII
DVD Review
Last week’s TV...
Indifference is rarely an opinion
about cult films. Those who wear the
robes and hoods worship their iconic
film and then there are non believers
who loathe it usually on the basis of
art house cinema being pretentious
nonsense. For this reviewer, a swift
drive through the cobbled streets
of Paris should be kept to Clarkson
and company, not a woefully thrown
together DVD.
1976 short film C’etait Un
Rendezvous begins with a car roar-
ing out of a tunnel in the French
capital. Speedily, the car growls past
other vehicles, zooms down one-way
streets and disperses pigeon gather-
ings instantly. The action is filmed
in one long shot with the camera
seemingly attached to the bumper of
the car. Consequently, our chauffeur
on this nightmare journey remains
entirely anonymous, only glimpsed
briefly when he steps out of the car
and embraces a young blonde woman
at the end of his lap. That’s it, film
over. Shorter than the stubby fingers
of a London cabbie and costs more
money than you care to place into his
greasy palms.
Admittedly the ending is subtly
unexpected. Contemporary televi-
sion adverts bombard you with tragic
climaxes resulting from the intoxica-
tion of an idiot having a ‘great night
out’, but then Rendezvous was never
going to finish with a pile up consider-
ing this was reality and the mysteri-
ous driver might have been the film’s
director. Cult status was attained by
the shroud that surrounds the short
film. Director Claude Lelouch has
remained tight lipped about the film.
Was it a Formula 1 driver? Was the car
a Ferrari or Mercedes? Was Lelouch
arrested for making the film? The
greatest mystery of all though is:
What was the point?
Rendezvous has managed to
become the petrolheads’ Holy Grail.
Forty year old men coping with a
mid-life crisis, finish washing their
Citroen “Oh, it’s convenient for the
kids, darling” Picasso before remov-
ing their anoraks, stepping indoors
and kneeling down for another view-
ing of Rendezvous to glimpse the
divine driver wishing they were that
‘gnarly’.
From cellophane wrapper to being
back in the case, all the DVD’s con-
tent is exhausted (pun absolutely
intended) within a fraction of the time
it would take you to watch an episode
of Cops or Police Camera Action!
A single short film packaged onto
a full price DVD is cheeky enough.
Accompanying the main feature with
four pages of text and three trailers
where the logos zoom in Microsoft
Powerpoint style reeks of ‘cash-in’
greater than super efficient Castrol
GTX.

Not forgetting his best line of all,
“My balls look best on your chin”. I
haven’t even got round to the insane
Sue White and my favourite Dr. Marty
“mo’foing pimp” D. Classic stuff and
the best comedy since Extras.
My last waffle
for the academic
year concerns
The Apprentice.
Once again I
became fixated
by the show
towards the end
of the series. The
final was last
week involving
the feisty, arro-
gant bitch Ruth and mildly pleasant
Michelle. Sadly, my favourite, Ansell
was fired the previous week, so these
two broads were left to duke it out.
The task: to each create a party on
Tower Bridge, with the help of previ-
ous contestants. That included Syed
who is probably the most self-cen-
tred, naïve and downright irritating
person on the planet.
For some unknown reason the con-
testants all seem really shit, at eve-
rything. Constant arguments and an
arrogance that is so blinding you
fail to see your own flaws, wouldn’t
make a good employee in my book.
Yet somehow these people, many of
whom haven’t obtained an A-Level,
manage to get through the selec-
tion processes and into the final ten.
Perhaps it’s down to the BBC to
choose who will argue with Alan the
most, or maybe anyone with any self-
respect and intelligence doesn’t actu-
ally enter the competition.
Unfortunately I found out Michelle
was the winner before I’d watched
the show, thanks to my inability to
divert my eyes from MSN’s news
homepage. Sigh. Nevertheless, it was
a good show and thankfully Little Ms
Piggy didn’t win.
I hope you’ve enjoyed my output
this year, but that’s it from me. Lucky
you, being spared what would have
been weeks of inevitable Big Brother
coverage! Take care, xx.

Tamsin Greig: Strangely alluring...
The car zooms down
streets past other
vehicles and disperses
pigeons ... that’s it.
The most self-centred,
naïve and downright
irritating person on the
planet.
Syed Ahmed: SHUT UP! SERIOUSLY.
