No doubt you’re feeling tired of revi-
sion, feeling worried that you’re not
going to score 100% again this year,
are bored of wanking and need some
stress relief. Lucky for you, this is
a guide (for the boys) to clubs in
London where you’re guaranteed to
pull, giving you that much needed
confidence boost just before those
exams.
Now, considering you are most
likely at Imperial, you’ve probably
got no chance of even having enough
courage to talk to a girl, much less
of convincing her to let you put your
penis inside her, so before the club
guide begins, I’ve been kind enough
to include a list of what not to say or
do. (I can vouch for these; I’ve seen
people trying it, and witnessed the
results). I’m not kind enough to tell
you what you should do though, but
just bare these few points in mind.
Remember! You are not at Imperial
College Union here, this is the big
wide world you’ve ventured out into,
it’s a scary and perilous place I know,
but don’t worry. Just keep in mind
that nobody out here cares a tiny
little bit about the structure of your
degree, nobody cares that you’ve got
9am tutorials on a Wednesday which
means you have to get up just for
that instead of sleeping in, its boring.
When someone asks you what you do,
it’s not an invitation to talk for 20 min-
utes about thermodynamics, maths
or quantum mechanics and don’t
whatever you do, mention that lame
fact that “Thermodynamics Sucks” it
just never, ever works. Neither does
claiming that “Imperial is the second
best university in the country for
Computer Studies” in a surprised
voice, when they tell you that they’ve
never heard of it. You might also want
to consider waiting until the fifth or
sixth date to mention that the Union
has the second biggest sci-fi library
in the world after MIT, and definitely
don’t ever mention your 180Gb porn
collection, and never, ever talk about
World of Warcraft.
Finally, if you are an IC rich kid,
don’t tell everyone about it. Who
cares what private school you went
to, what exclusive gentleman’s club
you’ve joined this year, the companies
your daddy owns and which mer-
chant bank you’ve managed get an
internship with. It makes you look
like a prick when you talk about that,
(I myself am a prick so I’m told on
numerous occasions, but we’re inter-
ested in you here, not me.) This isn’t a
‘networking opportunity’, you’re try-
ing to get a shag, not secure a job
interview.
Now with that in mind, if you follow
this guide completely you will have a
nearly 100% chance of meeting that
girl of your dreams (the one that will
allow you within 3 feet) and maybe if
you’re very lucky, and if she’s really
wasted, you wont have to face that
horrible prospect of graduating as a
virgin. Don’t get your hopes up too
high though, we’re going for cheap
sluts here, there is no way that this
guide will find you a nice girl.
Monday
Monday night is a hard one to start
with, sure there are some good clubs,
but that’s not the aim here, we’re
trying to get lucky tonight, not appre-
ciate the DJ’s or listen to music we
actually like. Don’t bother with Trash;
the last time someone pulled at that
place they were playing new tracks
by The Smiths. Imperial students
have no chance here. Your best bet is
heading off to The Roxy and grabbing
yourself a 16 year old, and if that fails,
go up to a random, loose looking slut
in Soho and ask her where a good
place is to go out on a Monday, you’ll
find out what happens.
Tuesday
This is easy, and again we head off
to The Roxy for our easy pull. Who
cares if they look younger than your
little sister, £1.50 bottles of beer mean
she’ll probably be so wasted she won’t
actually be able to focus on your butt
ugly face, just be sure to get in there
quick before everyone else does. Be
aware this will probably be where
you’ll find the most refined girls of
the week, indie kids tend to be pretty
self conscious, so even if she’s ugly
at least she’ll have some nice acces-
sories.
Wednesday
Quite obviously you have to make
your way over to Cheapskates, if you
don’t know where it is, just start off
in the union and follow all rugby toffs
there. This is probably the most guar-
anteed night you’ll have of getting
lucky, so if you can only tear yourself
from your computer for one night of
the week, make it this one. If you pre-
fer boys to girls, then Nag Nag Nag is
your place, just get tarted up..
Thursday
Lucky for us, Candybox, the sec-
ond best club for getting an easy
shag has moved from Wednesdays
to Thursdays, it won’t clash with
Cheapskates any more, allowing for
a mid-week double whammy. So head
on over there, get tanked up and find
yourself a cheap tarted up minger
who won’t give a dam that you’ll only
last 5 minutes in bed as long as you
buy her vodka and mixers all night.
If that doesn’t take your fancy, you
can always head off to Metro and find
yourself another indie girl, maybe
the same one you found at The Roxy
on Tuesday, perfect.
Friday
No doubt at this point you are feeling
a bit knackered, and if all is going
well you must have been lucky at
least once in the week, but don’t
lose momentum! Friday night is easy
picking. If at the beginning of the
week your taste for underage indie
girls was whetted, then get your
skinny arse over to club NME at
KOKO, there’s literally thousands of
them here, this is where they breed.
Being in Camden means when you
get bored there, you can move on
over to the Electric Ballroom; rock
chicks and pseudo goths galore. Be
aware though, nu-metal girls can be
pretty freaky in bed, so just watch out
if you’re a bit feeble, or you’ll wind up
someone’s bitch. Oh and make sure
you don’t end up with the ‘booby-
prize’ emokid, she may seem up for
it in the club, but once you’re back at
hers she wont stop crying and read-
ing you her poems.
If these still don’t take your fancy,
then head on over to Ministry with
cheap sluts ten-a-penny at their
hip-hop night. Be warned though,
Elephant and Castle isn’t South Ken,
Calling all Imperial geeks
so be prepared to get robbed or beat-
en up.
Saturday
Hopefully this morning you’ll be wak-
ing up in someone else’s bed, so make
sure you sneak away quietly, or make
your excuses and get the hell out of
there. There’s a whole other night
of fun and games ahead, so don’t do
anything stupid and geeky like falling
in love. Get home and have a rest,
play some CS put on your Clearasil
and get ready for another evening of
pasty hot geeky action.
If you don’t fancy any more super
clubs, then make your way over to
Belushi’s, formerly Prospects, this
is the best place in Fulham to pick
up a cheap Australian bird, and with
snakebites for only £2 they are sure
to be more trashed than you. What’s
more they’ll live near by so no need
for a long bus journey back, where
she runs the risk of noticing what you
look like.
If you are still in the mood for club-
bing, then you could make your way
over to Ministry again, crap House
galore, you’re sure to find some will-
ing bint. Just make sure if she’s hug-
ging you really hard, check that her
pupils aren’t too huge, you don’t want
your girl to crash by the time she gets
home, or she’ll never agree to sex.
Sunday
Sunday: the day of rest. No doubt you
will be completely shagged out by
now if you’ve followed the guide com-
pletely, and you’ll have absolutely no
chance of passing those exams after
spending a week partying and sleep-
ing around. Luckily for you there isn’t
much around on a Sunday where you
can meet cheap sluts, so use this day
as an opportunity to get back online
and tell all your clan members what
you’ve been up to this week, and book
an appointment with the STD clinic.
If you’ve followed this rundown of
clubs religiously, then most likely
you’ll have achieved your all time
dream of pulling a girl. Now you can
get back to revision, and after those
exams, go and try it all over again.
If you still failed to pull by following
this, then you have absolutely no
chance in hell. Give up now, you’ll
have to make do with that online
virtual girlfriend, carry on using that
porn collection you’ve amassed, and
get yourself a Blow Up Betty, she has
very lush lips.
Echobastard
Soon enough this will no longer be what you wake up beside.
Need a break from revision? Did you die on WoW? Tired of wanking?
Fear not, Felix Nightlife has prepared a London club guide just for you.
Definitely don’t
ever mention
your 180Gb porn
collection.
Get home, have
a rest, play
some CS and
put on your
Clearasil.
You’re trying
to get a shag,
not secure a job
interview.
