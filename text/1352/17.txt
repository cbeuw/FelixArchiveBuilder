Ethos – free gym & swim continues!
Imperial Sport Centre, Ethos, will
continue free gym & swim next
year. After the delay in opening of
the centre, the guarantee of a year
of free gym & swim had been cut
down to only 6 months, but due to
its popularity the Union has been
working extensively with College to
ensure that this continues for the
next year and this week it has been
conﬁrmed!
The Union continues to work with the
Sport Centre, so look out for further
details.

Aeronautical Engineering &
Mechanical Engineering Merger
Both these departments are intended
to be re-located to a new building
on Exhibition Road, when built*,
and the two departments are being
asked to produce a merger plan in
the next few months, looking at what
the major issues would be and what
problems would need to be overcome
if this were to go ahead. Following
this, a proposed structure for the
merged department would be drawn
up and then timescales given.
College have emphasised that both
the Mechanical and Aeronautical
Engineering undergraduate courses
are two very important courses with
excellent rankings and these two
separate undergraduate courses
would deﬁnitely remain. The
intention is to discuss further with
students in the new academic year.
* More information about this and
other building plans will be in next
weekʼs Union Newsletter in Felix.
Queen’s Lawn
In response to the strong student
opinion against the use of Queenʼs
Lawn for portacabins, the Union
has been lobbying the College on
the issue. In response the College
have said that itʼs extremely
unlikely that the Queenʼs lawn will
be used -“99% chance it wonʼt be
used”, but complete conﬁrmation
of this cannot be given until plans
for refurbishment of the Sherﬁeld
building are ﬁnalised.
More information about this and
other building plans will be in next
weekʼs Union Newsletter in Felix.
