Students exposed to
clinical waste
This incident is an embarrassment
to both College and the NHS Trust.
There is a high risk of disease and
contamination from clinical waste:
the Hospital have endangered both
our students and the public as a
whole.
It is difficult to fathom how this
was allowed to occur. There are
strict governmental regulations
regarding the handling of such
waste. These regulations were clear-
ly breached: not only was the waste
left unattended in a publicly acces-
sible area, but it was also unsecured
and overflowing.
When we first contacted the hos-
pital authorities, they appeared to
misunderstand, and the skip was
only removed when we contacted
College Security. Disciplinary action
should be taken against the person
responsible.

Saturday Exams
This simple clerical error could
have major implications for the
students sitting this exam. The
blunder will not only affect their
performance in this exam, but will
also have a knock-on effect on other
exams to be taken next week.
Many of the affected students also
have an exam the following Monday
and had planned to spend this
weekend intensively revising. Now
they will miss at least one day’s
revision.
These are important exams that
are worth one eighth of the year.
A poor performance could lead
to students finishing with a lower
standard of degree.
College have launched official
investigations into both of these
incidents. These are of great inter-
est to the student body and must be
made available for public scrutiny.
We want to hear your views

Clarification:
In last week’s issue (1351), in Union to effectively pull-out of ULU, we
stated: ‘The main options being investigated are rejoining the National
Union of Students (which is favoured by incoming Union president John
Collins)’. In fact Mr Collins is undecided, but plans to look into the matter.
We apologise for any confusion caused.
