Buttercup takes on the ‘book
Facebook: Crack for Geeks
with David Hasselhoff
It’s taking the college by storm and guess who’s here to guide you through it
“Ugly people make
you feel better about
yourself”
If you think some of the idiots on Imperial’s Facebook look stupid, wait until you see what
Buttercup has found. She’s been to the home of the phenomenon, the US of A.
The Facebook Photography Masterclass
he key to any successful proﬁle (i.e. one which gets you some ass) is a suitably attractive
picture - slutty, and yet sophisticated, is the way to go. Felix shows you how.

It’s official. You’re all losers. Facebook
losers. I suppose you can be forgiven
because Imperial students are so inept
at any face-to-face social activity that
we have to resort to an online feed-
ing frenzy to message people we see
everyday anyway. I am as guilty as the
rest of you. If you’re not on Facebook
you’re nobody. But even if you are,
it doesn’t make you somebody. Even
though everyone loves seeing every-
one else’s drunken photos, there really
are (believe it or not) better things to
do. Is it only me or do any of you trawl
through innumerable lists of friends’
friends’ friends trying to find either a)
an extreme hottie that clearly doesn’t
have the brain for Imperial but you
pray that they might be within a 5 mile
radius of London, or b) an extreme
ugly who just has the ‘point and laugh’
factor.
Ugly people make you feel better
about yourself. And great stress-reliev-
ers. Just zip them up in a punchbag,
hang it up, think of cute little Indian
children starving because these peo-
ple are using up food, and away you go.
Let it all out. You have my permission.
It’s not like you could make them look
worse anyway, and a few kicks gets
the blood circulating. They’ll come out
looking like they’ve just stepped out of
‘The Sound of Music’. You might have
even changed their life.
What is great about Facebook is that
it doesn’t only extend to people in the
UK, so if you really can’t find anyone
to poke fun at in England, although
trust me there are plenty, you can
cross the Atlantic and check out all the
Americans. Oh yes. There are those
who are self-confessed geeks or gang-
sters, and then there are the under-
stated ones who refuse to accept their
meaninglessness, but one look at their
photos says it all. Shame.
You can use the great search engine
to find anyone you want, any nationality,
any sexual persuasion, no limits! The
only problem is that you really have to
put yourself out there and actually ask
people, including Americans, to be
your friends. It’s almost as pleas-
urable as being thrown into
the gutter. Your dignity dis-
appears like copper coins
being thrown away one at a
time, down the drain. Then
once you’ve got your face in
the sewer you are obliged
to hold your breath and sit
tight until Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms.
Redneck can gallop on their
family pony to the single com-
puter in the whole of Utah and
‘accept’ you on their only
social network. I really
‘accept’ them too, in
my heart, just like I
‘accept’ retards.
If I wasn’t so desperate for a laugh
they wouldn’t have to make all that
effort just for me. But I am, and they
do. It’s politics. We treat Americans
like the office slave: call them over,
smile politely and pretend that we
want them to make some coffee, wait
until they make it and bring it over,
then frown and say it isn’t REAL cof-
fee, can’t they understand irony, tell
them to get out of our sight, and after
they’ve shuffled away we laugh like
the evil Mojo Jojo we all are. The
more satanic of us (probably me)
would laugh directly in their face. This
process repeats throughout the whole
of life: Americans appealing to the
English, trying to please us, and in
return we nod, smile and turn away
like we would do to a begging leper. But
let’s face it, if we didn’t protect
the chip on our shoulder they
would probably eat it. They are
like us at Imperial in many
ways: they have social prob-
lems, disabilities, and are
willing to take desperate
measures to fit in. You
know you can tell that
a computer belongs to
an American from the
Krispy Kreme icing all
over the keyboard. They
really are unclean. And
obese. But that’s another
Coffee Break.
Facebook is a worldwide
phenomenon. There are
people who have been
made famous by it. I
kid you not. One of these very promis-
ing individuals has made her mark on
men of all ages, especially the editors
of the acclaimed literature: “Maxim”
and “Playboy” She is full of talent, from
the fabulous town of Silicone Valley,
USA, and is truly a living inspiration
for us all, and shows us that dreams
really can come true, if you just put
your brain cell and breasts into it. In
other words, get naked and see what
happens. In a world like this, you can
never have too much fake tan. Out
with Miss World, in with the ‘Facebook
Princess’, Jenn Sterger. Things have
never been so good. In a recent inter-
view she revealed how she found true
happiness: “I just have an amazing
surgeon”. She has proven that people
love her for who she is: “almost every
girl on facebook wants my doctor’s
number”. Jenn is an upstanding young
woman, a wonderful role model, show-
ing that we really don’t have to live
with what we were born with. She is
no longer the shy, reserved woman
everyone found so boring, and at the
end of the interview she dispenses
one last precious snippet of true natu-
ralism: “damn it, I’m going to shake
what my doctor gave me!” In a later
interview the doctor reviewed his new
surgical technique, implanting unused
tissue from other areas of the body
to enhance the silicone, but he was
unwilling to reveal which tissue he
used with Jenn. Brain?
Facebook really has made a differ-
ence. But we must stop using it to
excuse ourselves from the vital tasks
at hand, like getting battered at the
Union bar. Instead of laughing over a
snakebite and triple vodka with real
people, we are determined to sit in our
rooms and laugh to ourselves with our
computers. Please. Just because we’re
at Imperial it doesn’t mean we have to
be cybersocial. I know you have money,
so quit booking your face appointments
with Doctor Alone and get
out more.
“Dreams really can
come true, if you just
put your brain cell

FOR DUMMIES
HOW TO MAKE
FRIENDS AND
POKE PEOPLE
Unless you’ve been under a rock for
the last week you can’t fail to have
noticed the revolution sweeping the
college: Facebook. It’s basically a social
networking website, like MySpace or
Faceparty. You have a profile where
you put your details, your photo and
various fascinating tidbits of informa-
tion such as your favourite book and
how much you love Coldplay.
The ‘cool’ thing about it is that you
have a friends list, where you can add
all your bestest pals from college and
home. As your friends list grows, so
does your e-penis, and in life the big-
gest penis wins.
If you really haven’t got with the
times yet and signed up, here are a few
basic steps to get started:
1) Go to www.facebook.com assum-
ing you have a computer handy (of
course you do, this is Imperial, by the
time you read this you will probably
have a microchip under your skin/in
your tooth/eye with fully-functioning
WAP).
2) You have to register. Check your
email. Get your password.
3) Log in and create your own pro-
file. Make sure you put down your
university/college as Imperial, the year
you’re going to graduate, then you
have access to all the groups and stuff.
You can upload photos, make albums
and all that jazzle. The photos have to
be 4MB or smaller. We’ve also thought-
fully included a guide to taking the
prettiest picture.
It’s pretty self-explanatory, and if you
need any more help than that you real-
ly shouldn’t be at this university should
you? Unless you’ve Forrest Gump-ed
your way in, in which case your mother
must be getting tired of screwing all
these old bald professors.
So you’ve got your profile, you’ve got
your sexy picture, and you’re ready
to Facebook. First of all you’ll want to
check out your friends’ profiles and
click Add *whoever* As A Friend to
show them how much you care. Pro-
tip: You can also click this button on
people you don’t know but just want
to touch.
You can also send people messages.
Should you find an attractive target
and wish to court them in a proper
manner, rather than being all rough
and ready and heading straight for
friendship, this is the way to go. Just
don’t forget to put plenty of xxxs at
the end. The occasional ;-) goes a long
way too.
You’ve bound to have noticed the
Poke button by now. Poking has no
purpose. It is completely pointless.
However it is childish and fun to go
around poking strangers, and of course
poking back those who were foolish
enough to poke you.
There’s also a group system. You
mightwanttojoinTheDavidHasselhoff
Appreciation Society, or maybe The
Appreciation Society Appreciation
Society. Felix also has a group but it’s
far too rad for mugs like you lot.
There you have it, Facebook in a
nutshell. Just remember to revise
rather than spending your time stalk-
ing Medic girls.
So you’ve decided to join the revolution
and whore yourself out on Facebook.
Excellent. Only the most desperate
and horny person will poke you if you
don’t include a picture of yourself
though, and unfortunately that school
photo isn’t going to cut it, ugly.
The first step is to realise that cool
people don’t know how to use the self-
timer on their cameras and that mir-
ror shots are the way to go. Make
sure you include cool things in the
background though. Even the smallest
details count!
It’s a scientifically proven fact that
the longer and floppier your fringe, the
more interesting you become. It also
helps to hide your Doherty-esque com-
plexion and any unsightly blemishes
such as your face. You’ll also want to
use eyeliner and mascara here. The
Beetlejuice look is popular this year.
Now for the pose. You want to be a
mix of erotic and exotic. Even though
this picture is the most important
moment of your life, you need to look
like your so damn hip you don’t even
need to look at the camera. Use your
best come-to-bed face and don’t forget
to pout.
All you need to do now is upload it,
guaranteeing a never-ending stream of
pokes and random messages.
Clockwise from top-left: Our heroine
struggles to hide the excitement of
discovering Facebook; The clas-
sic mirror shot, complete with sexy
background details; Sultry, exotic,
and potentially emotionally dam-
aged enough that she might let you
have a poke; Two eyes good, one eye
phwoaarrr!
Hoff’s on Facebook
He stinks of Old Spice and leaves an
orange trail as he goes, but he’s cool.
Always keen to get ‘closer’ to the
female population of Imperial, and
never one to miss the opportunity for
some good-old-fashioned tart-hunting,
Hoff was straight onto the Facebook
bandwagon.
Some of you may have been lucky
enough to have received deeply per-
sonal messages from him - basically
‘Babes you looking good, maybe you
and me can go halves on a bastard’ - or
maybe even a friend request.
If you’re interested, his profile can be
found at http://snipurl.com/hoffbook
and I’m sure he’d appreciate the friend
requests and pokes.
He’s actually in the office at a compu-
ter right now, desperately refreshing
his messages in the vain hope that any
of the tarts he’s been stalking have bit-
ten the hook. Poor Bastard.
I wouldn’t want to encourage any of
you to actually go through with sleep-
ing with him, as I know where he’s
been, and believe me, it’s not a pretty
sight. However, if you’re lonely and
hope that some of Hoff’s aura will rub
off on you (more likely it’ll be fake tan),
then why not chat to him.
Hoff has just asked me to make it
clear to everyone that “I only want
girls, dirty ones. No fucking homos or
midgets. I’ve had enough of them. I like
my women big”.
