Loved ones may not
mind being mired in
minutiae, but too many
details irritate you to
no end. Keep your attention on the
broad strokes. Look for simple solu-
tions. The simpler, the better – like
becoming an avrts student.
Chocolate Sex
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
My boyfriend and I like to keep things
exciting with a little sexual experi-
mentation, so when he suggested the
consumption of a Mars Bar from my
nether regions I decided to give it
a shot. The experience was unex-
pectedly pleasureable, I must say.
However, as things got hotter and
more slippery...it was necessary to
keep reinserting the chocolate as
it kept falling out, and after several
reinsertions we were alarmed to find
that the bar emerged missing a rath-
er large chunk of the end. After both
of us had spent a good half hour hav-
ing a rummage around for it with no
success, we decided that a trip to A &
E was called for. The situation was
rectified after an embarassing half
hour with the nurse, who seemed par-
ticularly g
ood humoured upon hear-
ing what had happened. The major-
ity of the chocolate was removed,
but I was told not to be alarmed if I
were to experience any brown dis-
charge. Thing is, despite the ordeal,
I rather enjoyed myself and would
like to try this out again, minus the
drama. I'm a bit worried about infec-
tion too. L
ashy, I need your sexual
expertise on how I can make this one
work.
Amy
Dear Amy,
First, way too much information. And
secondly, what the hell is wrong with
you?! What could you possibly find a
turn on about someone eating brown
solids from an area close to your
excretory - is this a word? as in the
area where you crap from? region. I
mean I'm certainly not one to turn my
nose up at a little sexual adventure as
many....MANY lucky men will remem-
ber - though none of you Imperialite
freaks - but there are far better ways
of keeping the spark going, leading
to f
ar fewer complications. As long
as there are no police present. But if
you insist on partaking in such activi-
ties in the future, dear God woman,
have a bit of common sense and keep
it in the wrapper! It doesn't take a
genius. Make sure y
ou cut off the
sharp bits first though...
My room-mate is a weirdo
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I’m a fresher and I’ve just moved
into halls. I’ve been assigned a room-
mate, but she has some very strange
customs. I know I should be tolerant
of her beliefs but its weird, should I
speak to her about it or what? This is
the first time I’ve ever shared a room,
and I really don’t know how to act
around her. What do you suggest?
Angela, 18
Dear Angela,
Well firstly don’t worry! I think that
as you’ve never shared a room before
you’re probably feeling extra anxious,
but I wouldn’t worry too much. You’re
now at university and you’re starting
afresh learning new things and in
your case new customs. I mean unless
your roommate follows some sort of
vampire culture, where she’s going
to attempt to drink your blood I don’t
see any reason for you to not accept
it, ask some questions about what
she’s doing and why.
Maybe your problem is just that you
don’t understand the customs. If
the reason you’re feeling awkward
is because your roommate is trying
to force her beliefs on you that’s a
different story. Simply pass on the
fact that you hate the taste of blood
and really don’t find people’s necks
that attractive, hopefully she’ll let the
topic drop.
I want my Mum
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I don’t know where to turn to, ever
since I’ve come to uni I’ve just felt
so homesick, I miss home so much,
I really can’t stand it. It’s so strange
and scary and all I want to do is go
back home and be with my friends
back home. What should I do?
Lize, 18
Dear Lize,
I know it’s hard to start all over again
at a new place, and that being back
at home is just comfortable. It may
seem easier, but you’d just be miss-
ing out. University is a great oppor-
tunity, and a chance for you to just
have some fun. You need to just get
out there and start having some fun,
meeting new people and living!!
You’re in London, there is so much
to do. I understand that it seems like
a big challenge, so start small, join a
few club and societies at college, start
hanging around in the common room
at halls, start making some friends
and you’ll feel a lot happier, even if
all you end up doing is playing cards
or game cube in your kitchen. You’ll
soon find that life at university is just
as good if not better than life back
home, just give it a chance.
Can’t Cook Won’t Cook
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I’m a fresher, and I’m starting this
year, and I can’t wait, I’m so excited,
but there’s a slight problem - I have
no idea how to cook. It may sound
stupid but I really don’t know what
to do!
Ben
Dear Ben,
I wouldn’t worry too much, so many
of the people who are joining you in
halls are in the same position. Some
of them may not even know how to
make toast, or may end up setting
pizza on fire! That’s halls!
You’ll all learn, the best thing is that
you guys share a kitchen, which is a
great way to make friends as you all
take it in turns to make meals.
However, if you’re sneaky you’ll find a
wannabe master chef who’ll happily
make all your meals for you, gourmet
style. Luck of the draw I’m afraid,
good luck xx
Dear Miss Confidentiality...

It was necessary
to keep
reinserting
the chocolate
into my nether
regions.
Scorpio (Oct 23 –
Nov 21)
There’s no point in
feeling guilty now.
Everyone is doing it,
it’s the new craze, and
you will get the test results back soon
enough, and even then it is treatable.
Ignore the evidence on Facebook,
who really looks at that anyway.
Sagittarius (Nov 22 –
Dec 21)
There’s a question in
your heart. It may be a
rhetorical question, but
if you leave too long of
a pause after it, the universe thinks
you want an answer and provides
one in the form of a meteorite des-
tined for the Queen’s Tower.
Capricorn (Dec 22 –
Jan 19)
The one who loves you
knows your secrets
and will eventually
tell the world through
Facebook after they find out that you
cheated on them with that handsome
librarian. But don’t worry, no one
looks at Facebook.
Aquarius (Jan 20 –
Feb 18)
Want to stand out? Just
stand there and say
nothing. Pretend that
they can’t see you and
undertake the actions that you leave
for special ‘you time’ in your room.
Advisable not to do this in an area
with security guards.
Pisces (Feb 19 –
Mar 20)
Trying to get a loved
one to change is a
waste of time now. Ac-
cept that they are stuck
in their shitty ways.
If they are a family member, either
disown them or end up like them. If
they are a mate, cut them.
Aries (Mar 21 –
Apr 20)
In an honest effort
to help you, friends
overstep established
boundaries by helping
you out of your pants
when you are drunk. Rather than
address this issue, be pleased that at
least someone got to see your pants.
Taurus (Apr 21 –
May 21)
You are suffering
from post-birthday
comedown or pre-
birthday excitement.
Overcome this by using your bullish
ways to make friends and relatives
throw parties for you every day.
Presents must also be demanded.
Gemini (May 22 –
Jun 21)
Your vulnerability is
wildly attractive, so
don’t be afraid to show
it. Potential loves
want to be needed. Show it through
becoming a gibbering wreck in the
corner of DaVinci’s aided by 4-6
snakebites (work to your limits and
drink responsibly).
Cancer (Jun 22 –
Jul 22)
A financial review is in
order. Accept that you
are approaching sum-
mer with no money and
may need to get McJob. Silver lining
is, you get you and your mates free
food thus making you more popular.
Virgo (Aug 23 –
Sep 22)
You’re hard on yourself.
Think of the good
things you do each day.
These acts are pebbles
thrown into a still pond,
causing ripples with far-reaching
positive effects, which you can meas-
ure with a nice little formula (how
exciting).
Libra (Sept 23 –
Oct 22)
You are fabulous, gor-
geous, widely popular,
destined for great
heights and will have
bucket loads of money
thrown at you to live the lifestyle that
you deserve. You are so worth it!
