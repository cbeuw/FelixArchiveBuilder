Botched exam: emergency resit on Saturday
Rupert Neate
Editor
Dozens of third and final year Maths
and Computing students have been
forced to sit a rescheduled exam on
Saturday due to a printing error. As
the students looked over the original
exam paper last Thursday, several
noticed that both pages were identi-
cal. The exam paper had two sets of
the same three questions, whereas
there should have been three on one
page and two on the other.
The students were informed that
the Geometry of Surfaces exam was
cancelled and they would all have
to go home and await instructions.
Subsequently, all students received an
email asking them when they would
be available to re-run the exam. As
this is the exam period and students
have many other commitments, the
only time all the students were avail-
able was Saturday afternoon.
Emily Lines, one of the affected
students, told Felix: “This is totally
unacceptable, how can a simple error
like this happen at Imperial which is
supposed to be a top-flight University.
This won’t only negatively affect my
performance in this exam but also
my other exams as my revision time-
table is now all over the place.”
Felix contacted Dr Frank Berkshire,
the Director of Undergraduate
Studies for Applied Mathematics, to
ask if the department believed that
students would be significantly disad-
vantaged by the mistake. He replied:
“It is difficult to see how candidate
performance would be adversely
affected – at least on this exam”.
The students will sit a completely
revised paper on Saturday that has
been hastily prepared by the depart-
ment and is currently being approved
by an external examiner.
Dr Berkshire confirmed to us that
“the facts of the case will be brought
to the attention of the exam board and
any disruption caused to students will
be taken into account when decisions
are made about [the grades]”.
The students have demanded
to know exactly how this incident
occurred. On this point, Dr Berkshire
only stated that it was “an error which
had not been thought possible”. A full
report on the incident is currently
being written.
Somestudentsbelievethattheexam
could have continued on Thursday
and was cancelled with undue haste.
They suggest that if the correct ver-
sion of the paper was ‘in the system’
it could have been printed and the
exam could have continued with only
a minor delay. Dr Berkshire told us
that although the paper was in the
system, “it was not obviously and
instantly [available]”.
When Felix informed Sameena
Misbahuddin, Union President, of the
blunder, she said, “Honestly, don’t
they check the paper over first? It is
very important”.
