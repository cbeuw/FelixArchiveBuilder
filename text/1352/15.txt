1) Reinvigorate the Union building masterplan
• stay focused on completion
• address environmental concerns
• welfare services and clubs getting priority for space
2) I will support greater faculty union autonomy
• faculty unions are vital to student community
• greater ﬁnancial independence for CGCU, ICSM, RCSU
• more effective union support in training etc.
• I support funding sabbatical positions for faculty union presidents
• increased funding for departmental societies
3) I will strive for a fairer Clubs & Socs budget allocation
• cut underspend
• reward careful budgeting and prudence
• supporting clubs that have a wider beneﬁt to the student body
4) I will employ a dedicated alumni fundraiser
• making the most of centenary opportunity
• enormous income potential for properly cultivated alumni links
• long-term revenue source for student welfare projects
• cost neutral (fund out of donations)
5) I will lay plans for opening a student job centre
• help students supplement income with diverse part-time and summer jobs
• develop work skills
• complementary to careers service
6) I will ensure responsive bars, cafes & shops
• create focus groups drawing on all Imperial students - all year groups, all
faculties, postgraduate and international - to regularly consult on what food,
drinks, varsity clothing etc. people want to buy
• minor changes in product offerings could result in signiﬁcant increases in
commercial turnover
7) I will offer more varied & accessible Union ents
• more diverse entertainments, eg. comedy nights, more club-led nights
• reducing drinks prices, especially soft drinks
• a decent cocktail menu!
8) I will argue for increased union funding from college
• per student, college funding has been falling in recent years.
• union clubs & welfare services are a major part of student life
• with top-up fees being introduced we deserve more funding
9) I will work for an effective Union website
• reduce paperwork, improve efﬁciency, enhance communication
• use to its fullest potential as gateway to the Union
10) I aspire to a Union that serves everybody
• encourage different groups of students to use Union services and facilities, eg.
international students, postgraduates and non-drinkers
• union facilities accesible to all members
Plus working
for a cleaner,
greener union!
