Tools, iron, wine. An alcoholic blacksmith’s dream.
Felix’s music section loves you.
Not many acts can get away with stick-
ing to the same formulae throughout
a career. While some take an almost
schizophrenic/polarised approach to
every album, totally contradicting the
last (Madonna springs to mind), oth-
ers like to develop and grow, urging
the listener to follow them into new
ground. Often this doesn't work, the
band implodes and becomes a mem-
ory of a particular year, rather than
one of true musical inspiration. Then
again the occasional group do ‘make
it’ and become iconic, genre defining,
and much loved by even the most
ardent music critic.
But what about Tool? They do noth-
ing. They arse around, play infre-
quent concerts, and write their web-
site blog. When they get bored, once
about every half a decade, they whip
a new album out of their trousers,
put it down on the table, and watch
as hordes of disaffected American
youths gorge on the dark lyrics that
Maynard spits down the microphone.
Don't get me wrong, I love Tool. In
fact, I managed to scoop a coveted
ticket to their two night residency
at the Hammersmith Apollo; but as
they begin to average a 5 year hiatus
between albums, you start to wonder
if they are just a one trick pony, lazily
rehashing a 14 year old sound when
their bank balance gets low. 10,000
Days is definitely a, 100%, no-doubt-
about-it Tool album. It throbs like a
headache, occasionally exploding into
a full blown migraine of distortion and
screams: But it is not until track six,
Lipan Conjuring, that we actually
hear something new. Something that
reminds the listener of Henry Rollins
on Undertow (their second album).
Two tracks later, Rosetta Stoned
reverts back to their run of the mill
sound, containing a riff lifted straight
from Lateralus with a few sampled
vocals added to dupe the listener into
thinking it is new.
After listening to 10,000 Days it
becomes obvious that Tool aren't
planning on pushing the boundaries
of music forward any more. Perhaps
Maynard put too much into his side
project, A Perfect Circle; or perhaps
it has just taken five studio albums
for them to loop back to the start.
Which ever it is Lateralus remains
Tools magnum opus and 10,000 Days
is half the album it thinks it is. The
cool Alex Gray artwork isn't going to
save you now boys.

for the night. After this engaging
aside, Calexico got on with their hour-
and-quite-a-bit showcase. If you have
heard the new stuff by them, you
might be disappointed, but their set
was well timed, paced, and packed
full of melodies and harmonising
trumpets. Yes, harmonising trum-
pets! Along with a cover of Love’s
Along Again Or (with trumpet fan-
fare in the chorus), Calexico were
more than entertaining and impor-
tantly, they were different from Iron
and Wine.

Hyperbole goes hand in hand with
the music scene like poor personal
hygiene goes with a physicist (the
smell in Blackett after a hot day would
upset a skunk). Speaking of which,
harsh personal opinions also occur
in the music scene. Nonetheless, I
am not mincing my words when I say
that out of the many shows I’ve been
to (enough to make me more than
extremely cynical) Iron and Wine
with Calexico is perhaps the best and
most memorable. As I sit here writing
whilst watching Full Metal Jacket,
thinking about that night fills me
with inner tranquillity set against the
harsh martial tones on the telly in the
background. It really was that good.
For those who are fans of either of
said artists, you have no doubt picked
up their magnificent collaboration
record. If you haven’t, I recommend
you do by the end of the day, other-
wise whatever Supreme Being you
believe in will never forgive you. It
is a record of delightful harmonies,
melodies, and delicate vocals, with all
the power of the Kubrick classic (see
above). So after hearing their col-
laboration and finding out they were
playing together at the Kentish Town
Forum (the size of the Astoria, but
with brilliant sound and ambience) I
couldn’t wait to go.
The best part about the gig is that I
was constantly guessing about what
was going to happen. I didn’t know
whether they’d play separate sets
and then play a set together at the
end or whether they’d play together
and have a couple of support acts.
So it was to both my simultaneous
relief and surprise when the hirsute
Sam Beam, a.k.a. Iron and Wine,
strutted onto the stage, carving up
the air around him with his magnifi-
cent beard. The sound, despite suf-
fering from some early feedback, was
wonderfully clear. Ironically, wearing
an amazing Doctor Who t-shirt, his
songs defied time and stretched out
melodies, accomplishing so much in
what feels like such a short time. His
set drew songs from Our Endless
Numbered Days with a couple of
newies and felt both infinitely long
and delicately short.
Then Sam announced, “I’m gonna’
bring on the Calexico guys for a few
songs.” These magical words herald-
ed the first set of the songs they wrote
together and it was delightful. One of
the songs, Red Dust, featured normal
and slide guitar solos. This would
usually make me sigh in despair but I
loved every minute. Then Calexico’s
Joey Burns announced that they
would take a 10 minute break and
after an hour and a half’s worth of
music, I didn’t care one bit.
True to his word, Mr. Burns came
back after 10 minutes with one
Salvador Doran, a Mexican version
of Tom Jones who makes animal
noises whilst playing Flamenco gui-
tar. As much as that could sound
both pretentious and/or awful, it was
fantastic, and somehow appropriate
LIVE REVIEW
Then, when Calexico come back on
for their second encore they bring
Iron and Wine on with them along
with Salvador, meaning there were
12 people on stage at once. With this,
there was both quantity and quality
and again the Forum’s sound-system
kept up with this amassing of musi-
cians and the sound was still clear
and entrancing. They performed He
Lays in the Reins together (including
Salvador’s operatic third verse) and
this song resonated in my ears for
long after I had left the venue

The icing on the cake however was
the cover of Velvet Underground’s
All Tomorrow’s Parties (the name of
the festival that also organised this
night). It was an apt near-ending and
a brilliant re-invention of a classic.
All I can say is if you can’t appreciate
music like this then I refer back to
the aforementioned film in saying:
“What is your major malfunction
numb-nuts? Didn’t Daddy show you
enough attention as a child?”

Dawn of a new, not so
different era
It’s exam and project time for
many, and this means a few things.
One of them being a thinning of
Felix. It also means a shortage
of staff.
Our ever-opinionated Music edi-
tor (and soon-to-be triumphant
new Felix editor) Andrew Sykes
has a workload the size of an ele-
phant’s love package. This means
that I have come to help ease the
burden that is making this music
section the envy of all other music
sections.
Exam and project stress have
also distracted our reviewers, so
I have taken it upon myself to
venture into the big, bad world
and witness some brilliant live
music. But luckily it isn’t the Matty
Show completely. I have a special
guest, Nick Simpson, reviewing
the extremely long-awaited and
disappointing new Tool album. I
have to agree with him, it is a slice
of pap.
Also bringing in this new era is
a competition where you, yes you,
can win tickets to the Isle of Wight
festival!

Looks scarily similar to our last family photo portrait. I have a serious case of beard envy though...
