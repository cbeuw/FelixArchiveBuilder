Summer is here!
Cryptic Crossword 1352 A novel on tax
With exam term upon us, many
people seem to be spending hours
cooped up in their department or the
library, working toward that vitally
important next exam. Whilst this is
all good and well, it is impossible to
spend every waking hour working,
and one must take some time off in
order to clear the head, ready to take
in more knowledge. I thus propose a
nice relaxing sport within a 2 minute
walk of most departments and not
too physically exerting. No, I’m not
talking about Curling, Croquet on the
Queen’s Lawn is THE sport of this
summer!
Many of you have seen or heard of
Croquet in some shape or form –
the images of Alice in Wonderland,
cucumber sandwiches and toffs play-
ing in back gardens of giant country
estates spring to mind. However, cast
that all aside for a moment and con-
sider a new, streamlined version of
Croquet complete with daring play,
plenty of skill and lots of fun. Although
Croquet has an image of being a
game for retired and semi-retired,
it has made a storming come-back
amongst the younger generation. The
physical skills and tactics are easier
for young people to pick up, and one
can reach a high standard of play
after just 3 months.
Modern Croquet combines skill and
tactics – on a lawn which is 35 by 28
yards (32 x 25 metres), and where the
hoops are just 3 millimetres wider
than the balls which go through them,
one needs a bit more than luck to
play the game well! There are two
types of Croquet which are popular in
England, we play both of them:
Golf Croquet is more synonymous
with the ‘vicious’ image of ‘back gar-
den croquet’ (the croquet of country

Is croquet the new cricket?

7 of the 13 hoop points on offer to
win.
Association Croquet, the main vari-
ant of the game, is similar to snooker
– one has to create ‘break’s in order
to achieve the objective of getting
both your balls through all the requi-
site 12 hoops and to hit the peg (post)
before your opponent. It has drawn
links with chess as well, for the high
level of tactics and psychology behind
the game. It is ideally suited to people
who understand lines and angles -
many of the top players in the current
croquet world have a strong science
background; in fact, Bernard Neal,
the current president of the Croquet
Association (the governing body of
Croquet in UK) was head of the civil
engineering department here a few
years back!
Imperial sent a team to the National
Student Championships at Oxford in
June 2005, where we reached the
semi-finals of the team competition,
and yours truly beat off some strong
opposition to finish 2nd in the indi-
vidual category (so apparently I’m
the 2nd best student croquet player
in the UK ??); the Nottingham Uni
student who won it got to the last 8
of the World Championships later
that summer. So all-in-all, Imperial
consolidated our position as one of
the best student croquet clubs in the
country. We plan to take an invigor-
ated team back to Oxford this coming
June to stage an upset on holders and
local favourites Oxford Uni!
If you are interested in Croquet in any
shape or form, be it for amusement,
relaxation, or you want to compete in
the Imperial Croquet team, contact
croquet@ic.ac.uk, or simply come
and find us on the Queen’s Lawn
when we are there. Meeting times
are on Wednesday afternoons and
several lunchtimes a week depending
on availability. We are looking to hold
a croquet tournament open to all stu-
dents and staff this term – keep your
eyes peeled for more details!
On Sunday 5th March 2006, Hyde
Park hosted the first ever Marrow
Fun Run, in aid of the Anthony Nolan
Trust. This is an international organi-
sation that keeps a registry of bone
marrow donors who can potential-
ly help cure sufferers of fatal blood
disorders, such as leukaemia. The
run had aimed to attract 500 run-
ners to run either 8km or 3km races.
Entering the run couldn’t have been
easier – pick up an entry form prior
to the event, sign up online or simply
register on the day.
As the members of the Marrow
committee gathered at Hyde Park
corner in the morning, there was
a tense feeling. The Piccadilly Line
through Hyde Park Corner had been
part suspended that morning, making
it extremely difficult for the runners
to arrive in time for the 11 o’clock
start. Then, there was the freezing
cold, windy conditions, which could
easily have kept all the runners in
bed. One hour before the scheduled
start, the volunteer marshals had
marked out the courses for both dis-
tances and the St Johns first aid tent
was in place. However, there were
no runners to be seen – it looked like
the planned start would have to be
pushed back.
Slowly, the participants arrived at
the start line to register their names
and pick up their running T-shirts.
Before long, Hyde Park corner was
filled with bustling runners and their
supporters – including young chil-
dren, the elderly, sports teams and
fitness fanatics, college professors
and regular people trying to get a bit
fitter. Even the Marrow superheroes
– Bone Boy and Marrow Dog were
spotted going through their pre-run
stretches!!
The event eventually kicked off at
11.30, with an amazing 536 registered
runners. The 3km run started first,
shortly followed by the 8km event.
Whether walking or running, the par-
ticipants seemed to be really enjoying
themselves despite the cold.
“We hope to see
you again next
year”
As runners crossed the finish line,
they collected a fun run goodie bag,
a much needed drink and their cer-
tificates. A special mention must be
made to the winners. Pierre Gaudin
won the 3km men’s event with a
cracking time of 11 minutes and 40
seconds. The aptly named Deborah
Speed won the woman’s 3km with a
time of 16 minutes and 30 seconds.
In the 8km run, the men’s winner
was William Burrard-Lucas with a
fantastic time of 30 minutes and 10
seconds and the woman’s winner was
Angharad Care with a super speedy
time of 30 minutes and 20 seconds.
Another highlight was the perform-
ance of Bone Boy who came in last in
the 8km run.
Marrow Fun Run 2006, eventual-
ly proved to be a massive success,
raising an incredible £10,000 for the
Anthony Nolan Trust and providing
a relaxed and fun day out. A huge
thank you must be made to the fol-
lowing people: Matthew Butler (fun
run organiser), Gokulan Phoenix
(Marrow President), all the volun-
teers who helped with the smooth
running of the event. Most impor-
tantly, Marrow would like to give a
massive thanks to the runners – the
money you raised was unbelievable
and we hope you enjoyed yourselves.
We hope to see you again next year,
along with many more fun runners.
