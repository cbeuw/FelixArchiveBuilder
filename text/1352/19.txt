Last ChanceTo Nominate For Union Colours
What are Union Colours?
This term the Union will be awarding
Colours, which are the way the Union
recognises the service, contribution
and dedication of someone over the
course of the year to the Union.
There are 5 types of Colours - Half
Colours, Full Colours, Outstanding
Service Awards, Fellowships and
Distinguished Fellowships.
Who can get Colours?
Anyone can receive these awards,
except the Union Sabbatical Oﬃcers
and the Felix Editor.
Who can nominate someone for
Colours?
Any Imperial student (but you canʼt
nominate yourself!).
What do you get when you win
Colours?
Colours are a great honour! But
as well as that, everyone who is
presented with an award gets a
certiﬁcate, a tie or pin, and in the
case of the higher awards other
things like engraved tankards and

Union Elections
One Club or Society will be awarded
the Presidentʼs Award for Clubs &
Societies.
This is an award, only started a few
years ago, for which youʼll have
noticed the winning Club/Society
name on the Honours board in the
Union Building foyer.
If you have any suggestions of who
should receive this, let you Faculty
Union President or CSC (Club and
Society Committee) Chair know so
that they can collate suggestions and
nominate them.
Alternatively email me on
president@imperial.ac.uk.
So if you think an
individual or a club/
society deserves
recognition, donʼt let
them go unnoticed.
Nominate them today!
Award for Clubs & Societies
Last chance to nominate
Honorary Life membership of the
Union. The Union keeps a record of
all the people awarded Colours.
So what have you got to do to
deserve each type of Colour?
To get Half Colours you have to
have made a “positive contribution
to the general life of the Union in an
extraordinary fashion.”
To get full Colours you have to
“repeatedly, through outstanding
achievements, over the course of
the year, have made a signiﬁcant
contribution to the life of the Union.”
For an Outstanding Service Award
“you will have displayed continuous
outstanding achievement across a
broad spectrum of Union activities.”
Few of these are given out, only
ﬁfteen a year at most.
Itʼs a lot harder to get the Fellowship
which is only given to those “who
have continuously served the Union
in an exceptional manner.” Very few
are given out.
There is also the Distinguished
Fellowship . Itʼs “only awarded to
those Full Members who have served
the Union in a selﬂess and dedicated
manner which is both exceptional
and beyond reproach.”
If you donʼt know which award to
nominate someone for, just choose
the one you feel is appropriate and
the Colours Committee will change if
necessary...
How can I nominate someone?
Nominations are open until Monday
22nd. Nomination forms can be
downloaded from www.union.ic.ac.
uk/colours and can be emailed to
colours@imperial.ac.uk.
Youʼll have to give the name of
the nominee, the award you are
nominating them for and tell us, in
less than 200 words, why you think
they should get it.
What happens then?
Your nominations will be considered
by the Unionʼs Colours Committee
and then the results will be
announced towards the end of the
term in Felix. Successful nominees
will be given their awards at a
Colours ceremony in June.
For those of you who have been thinking about this and
havenʼt yet nominated someone, this week is your last
chance. Nominations close on Monday 22nd May.
