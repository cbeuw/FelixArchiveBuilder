Engineers visit horpe Park
The UK’s biggest amusement park
attraction opened at Thorpe Park in
March, just as term was ending. At
205ft tall “Stealth” certainly is big. It
is Europe’s tallest and fastest coaster
and can be found at the Surrey-based
amusement park. It launches from
standing at the station to 80mph in
just 2.3 seconds, before throwing you
up and vertically down down over its
205ft hump! The whole experience
lasts just 20 seconds and 15 Imperial
students got the chance to see the
complex engineering from behind the
scenes.
At 7am, they arrived at the some-
what deserted theme park to be met
by their contact, who then took them
to meet the head of engineering in
the maintenance sheds. Here, every
morning, the team of ride engineers
would go over every single nut and
bolt of all three carts, ensuring noth-
ing had gone astray the previous day.
The wheels would even be re-aligned
to ensure a smooth ride. Indoor heat-
ing lamps warm the carts before they
leave the sheds in order to ensure
that the lubricant on the wheels
works as it should. If it’s under 5
degrees Celsius many of the rides
will not function. It was 6 degrees on
the day…
Leaving the shed, they passed the
ride’s first passengers of the day:
The water dummies. Each dummy,
weighing the same as a person, gets
a ride before real people get a chance
to even queue. After the 20 second
ordeal, they were all intact. This was
taken to be a good sign.
The hardcore engineering lies
under the large hump, inside a
bunker. It contains one very large,
very expensive motor; containing 42
smaller motors, to be precise. Oil and
Nitrogen are pumped-in constantly
to store energy from the National
Grid between ride launches (to stop
Staines having blackouts every min-
ute or so). This stored energy is then
released causing a cable to be reeled
with an impressive force. This cable
is attached to the cart via a catch-
car shortly after everyone is secured
(this is the bit of the ride when judder
forward and back before you shoot
off!). The force stored in the pipes
in here could slice you in half if the
cable buckled. Furthermore, if the
oil in the system leaked, the whole
bunker would be filled in seconds.
This explains the rather secure door
which is sealed before operation.
The tour was finished with a look
at the launch track and the controls.
Every day, engineers run the catch
car at a snails pace along the 80m
launch track feeling by hand any
vibrations which indicate damage
in the track. The control system is
simple to operate, but pretty complex
in the background. In order to make
sure you get over the top, the launch
force must automatically reconfigure
itself based on the weight of people
and weather conditions. Every 5
runs averages are taken with the
intent that the cart reaches the crest
at 12m/s. If you balance at the top
(this happened once on a similar ride
in the US called Top Thrill Dragster.
People were stuck for 35minutes at
400 ft), there is a rope for a rescuer
to climb to give you a nudge – but this
should never happen…
Once the park opened, the students
got a chance to experience the ride…
According to one of the lucky guests:
”It’s awesome! It’s very fast, very
smooth and you get a great view for
the second or so that you are at the
top. Get down to Thorpe Park and
give it a go!”

Student wins prize
and trip to Florida
Mansoor Ansari, an Imperial
PhD student in the department of
Chemical Engineering and Chemical
Technology, has won an IChemE
Particle Technology Subject Group
(PTSG) bursary to attend the World
Congress on Particle Technology 5 in
Orlando, Florida.
The aim of the PTSG student travel
bursary competition is to encourage
top PhD students to maintain the
nation's competitive edge in this fast
growing discipline.
Mansoor's study objective is to
develop an analytical approach to
produce "designer granules" in binder
granulation process - a vital process-
ing step in chemical, food and phar-
maceutical industries. His research
supervisor is Dr Frantisek Stepanek,
of the Chemical Engineering depart-
ment.
