radiation but more opaque to the
long-wave, infra-red, radiation
emitted from the planet's surface.
These gases effectively trap the
outgoing radiation in the lower
levels of the atmosphere and so
keep the surface warm.
The most important of these gases
is not, as is frequently supposed,
carbon dioxide (C02), but water
vapour. Not only is water vapour
spread throughout the lower
atmosphere but there are also,
effectively, inexhaustible reservoirs
of the stuff iocked-up' in oceans
and polar ice-caps. It is the fact that
the temperature on this planet is
such that water can exist as solid,
liquid, and all-important vapour,
which means that this temperature
(and life as we know it) can be
sustained. Would be philosophers

THE UNCERTAINTIES:
THE AIR...
Water vapour is, as I said, a
'greenhouse gas' and so is partially
responsible for warming the lower
atmosphere. Yet paradoxically, it is
a cosmic fluke that, on Earth, water
can also exist as a solid and liquid
which helps keep the temperature
stable.
Air cools as it moves up through
the atmosphere, and the water
vapour within it condenses out to
form clouds.
At the simplest level, clouds can
reflect the shortwave radiation from
the Sun back into space, stopping
it ever reaching and warming the
The properties of clouds are also
affected by industrial activity. It is
a peculiarity of the atmosphere that
clouds will form more readily in
'dirty' polluted air. This is simply
because the water droplets need
something to form round as they
grow, and in polluted air there is a
large supply of convenient, floating,
muck.
Mankind produces a large
amount of this dirt in the form of
sulphur compounds which, like
C02, come from the burning of
fossil fuels. Unlike C02, however,
the sulphur compounds act to cool
the planet by changing the way the
clouds absorb and reflect radiation.
research. The uncertainty is such
that most researchers split the
greenhouse effect into a clear-sky
effect, about which they are fairly
unanimous, and a cloudy-sky effect,
where they cannot always agree on
the sign, let alone the magnitude,
of any temperature change.
...THE PLANET...
The oceans can also greatly affect
the climate. The atmosphere and
ocean are not independent but
linked. It is impossible to describe
one without considering the other.
Ask an oceanographer why the
flow in the Atlantic is as it is, and
they will reply that it depends on the
distribution of the wind. Ask a
meteorologist why we see these
winds, and you will be told that it
is intimately related to the surface
temperature of the ocean. It is only
recently that attempts have been
made to describe the atmosphere
and ocean as a single system.
It has long been known that water
is far more effective than air at
storing and transporting heat. A

significant amounts of the gas into
the atmosphere continuously for
well over a century. It can be
argued, with a horrible plausibility,
that this must lead to the trapping
of more and more of the outgoing
radiation and an inevitable increase
in the surface temperature.
It is not just C02. In recent years,
even more potent greenhouse gases
have been introduced, including the
ultimate chemical bad guys, the
'ozone-guzzling' Chloro-Fluoro-
Carbons (CFCs). According to the
simple theory, this can only make
matters worse.
The simple theory seems
damning, and if it were all that
mattered, global warming would be
understood. This is far from the
truth. The simple theory is based on
the idea of a balance between the
radiation absorbed by the
atmosphere and the energy supplied
by the sun. It neglects the fact that
the atmosphere is constantly
moving, transporting heat, water
vapour and other gases up and down
and across the surface of the globe.
surface. Nothing is ever that simple:
clouds can also emit outgoing long-
wave radiation back down, trapping
heat. That is why a cloudy winter
night is generally warmer than a
clear one.
Whether clouds warm or cool
depends on more than just the time
of day. The height and thickness of
the cloud, its temperature, whether
it is made of liquid water or ice, and
the size of the droplets making it up,
are all highly significant. Some
recent work from the National
Centre for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) in the United States
predicts that a small decrease in the
average size of cloud water droplets
in the lower atmosphere could
completely counteract the currently
predicted greenhouse warming.
One expert, from the United
Kingdom Meteorological Office,
has described the effect of
producing copious amounts of both
as rather like 'driving with the
accelerator full down and the brakes
on at the same time'.
It is worth mentioning that one of
the few ecological measures agreed
upon, by the majority of
industrialised countries, is a
reduction in the sulphur emissions
which are known to be responsible
for acid rain. To continue the
motoring metaphor, this is akin to
releasing the brake. It is ironic that
in reducing one environmental
problem, we could easily be
worsening another.
The study of the effects of cloud
is a relatively new branch of climate
transported by the oceans. Yet the
study of the ocean has always
lagged behind that of the
atmosphere.
This was partly a practical
problem; the atmosphere is easier
to study than the ocean simply
because you cannot breath the
ocean. But there is also the matter
of priority. People, from farmers to
fighter pilots, need to know what
the weather is going to do
tomorrow. It had always been
assumed that, as the basic patterns
of ocean temperature and
circulation vary comparatively little
from day to day, the small changes
which do occur have little impact
on the atmosphere. In the short
term, this is largely true. In the
longer term, when studying not the
weather but the climate, these slow
variations can make all the
difference.
The work which has been done
has revealed that the movement of
water throughout the oceans is
every bit as complicated as the
movement of air in the atmosphere.
