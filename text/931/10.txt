News Review Felix 931 18 March 1992
owners said they thought he was
talking about his job description.
Mr Farrant was banned from the
union building for 24 hours, which
he unofficially extended to 72 hours
as he failed to turn up for work on
the following Monday. The matter
was referred to an executive
disciplinary committee. Once they
remembered who Mr. Farrant was.

to give him the benefit of the doubt
and a large bucket of whitewash. By
this stage, M r Farrant had
developed a pink elephant fixation
about pianos; later in the term he

The 'Paper Transistor Award for
Slavish Copying of the B B C goes
this year to IC Radio, beating off
a determined challenge from
S T O I C . STOIC effectively
sabotaged their chances of winning
this award when they axed 'Going
for Coppers', even though nobody
noticed, especially as. they wasted
no time in restoring this drivel to
the schedule. IC Radio, however,
decided to cover the General
Election campaign long before it
was called, as the smart money
decided that the campaign would
fall during the holidays.
The strategy was fairly simple.
The economy was to be analysed in
two interviews, one Conservative,
one Labour. Then a member of
each main party was to be
interviewed, covering the three
Imperial constituencies. Of course,
IC Union President Zoe Hellinger at the press briefing after the
Felix heist scandal early in February
with the Peter Brooke interview
running to over half an hour, the
Labour candidate in the
Westminster South seat was also
questioned.
Rob Marvin, of Conservative
Students, was first off. He
described the recession as a unique
coming together of economic
circumstances. Unique
mismanagement, more like. When
Andy Love, Labour candidate for
Edmington, complained about
minor differences between Labour
speakers being exploited, he was
quite surprised to learn that the two
quotes actually came from Neil
Kinnock. It's not the first time
Kinnock has contradicted himself.
This was also the first candidate to
state publicly that not only would
National Insurance increases be
phased in, but also pension and
child benefit increases.
Then for the tour of the
constituencies. Susan Broidy,
Liberal Democratic candidate for
Chelsea told IC Radio that she
couldn't comment on LibDem
economics because she hadn't been
to the meeting yet. Ann Holmes,
Labour candidate for Kensington,
told us we couldn't have it both
â€¢ ways, crying poverty and then
complaining about the delay. Peter
Brooke said he would support a
rival union to the NUS, and that he
wasn't a candidate for the
Speakership of the Commons.
Charlie Smith, for Labour in
Westminster, appealed to students
to vote and to use the postal vote if
necessary, something echoed by
Union President Zoe Hellinger.
The 'Where Does He Get Them

award goes to Chris Riley, for
gratuitous environmental slots. His
speciality seems to be dolphins.
Chris scored rather better on his
coverage of St. Mary's medical
stories, and positively drooled over
the interview with Fiona Crawford,
a member of the Alzhiemer's
research team that made its way
across the pond.
The team had identified the
changes in a protein which is
responsible for Alzhiemer's.
Although these changes were not
the cause of Alzhiemer's in all
cases, Fiona Crawford told IC
Radio that 'because this protein has
been implicated in the disease long
before now, we're fairly certain that
this will provide a pathway to a cure
for Alzhiemer's'. However, she did
not think the team had got the
recognition it deserved. 'Far from
it. The only interest that was
