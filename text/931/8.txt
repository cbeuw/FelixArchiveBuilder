An offshoot of Estates is the
Conference and Accommodation
Office, who get the 'Judge Pickles'
award for their grip on reality.
Using the old 'give an inch, seize
a mile' approach, they decided to
increase still further the number of
rooms allocated to the conference
season, completely oblivious to the
recession.
Completely oblivious to the
purpose of student accommodation
as well. And indeed to the extent of
the student backlash. Such was the
ferocity of the counter attack that
the rarely spotted 'management

'walk-in crime'

observed in its natural state - panic.
With panic came confusion. The
left office didn't know what the
right office was doing.
The story broke on STOIC on
30th January, during a live
interview with Loretto
O'Callaghan, Student
Accommodation Officer, who told
David Henderson Begg that

By the following morning, Felix
had put a figure on this, a mere £18
a day. This was greeted with
outrage by students and others,
provoking a barrage of letters from
Accommodation & Conferences,
which served to muddy the waters
completely. Indeed, two weeks
later, IC Radio reported,
'controversy still reigns over the
laugh. Then Conferences seemed to
get their act together. Anothei
statement: 'Blocks of rooms in
Southside, Linstead and Weeks
Halls will be set aside for business
use, while the remaining rooms will
be free for student use. Students
will not have to pay business rates.'
So how many business rooms did
they actually need? 'Er, we're not
quite sure.'

Sheelagh Crampton,
Accommodation and Conference
Manager. Not so. Two students
came on IC Radio as late as last
Friday to complain about the lack
of storage. 'Notices were put up to

to be given five storage rooms for

he's not going back on his decision,
and the 5 storage rooms are

any more, and whatever we do is
not going to affect his decision, so
we do intend to lead a peaceful
protest across the park to outside 15
Prince's Gardens in the next few
days ... residents in F K feel pretty
strongly about this, and there are
enough people in hall willing to
protest about it, we're willing to do
something about it.'
A group willing to get up and do
something are the entrepreneurial
thieves who have exploited the
'walk-in crime' at the college. Prize
