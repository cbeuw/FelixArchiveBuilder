Letters Felix 931 18 March 1992
Mary's
Dear Adam,
Elections
Let me start by stating that St
Mary's College Union is a C C U of
Imperial, originally they were an
individual unit but had to merge
with other London colleges in
recent years to prevent closure.
Imperial gave them the support and
they became our fourth constituent
college.
St Mary's students should
therefore be most greateful to our
Union for without us they would not
exist.
How is it then that they gave our
electorial candidates such a hard
time at the Hustings on 2nd March.
There are a number of points I
would like to pick up from the front
article of Felix 929.
1. Mary's students believed that
the candidates' interest in Mary's
affairs was due simply to the
election.
This is most probably true. When
the colleges merged Mary's wanted
to retain its autonomy from IC and
they themselves have little or no
interest in IC or its students. So why
should we have an interest in them.
2. Candidates were ridiculed
when they claimed they had an
active interest in St Mary's.
What else could they say after
being reminded that Ben Turner,
the last candidate to say Mary's was
unimportant, was defeated at first
ballot.
Spilt Grease
Dear Adam,
So many weeks after the original
incident I feel I should speak up
once again. Yes, I am the principal
co-writer of the infamous Grease
review.
It has been suggested that I should
'own up' to writing this review to
encourage more of the people
responsible for removing the
Felices to own up as well. While
Reality
Dear Adam.
In reply to Samin Ishtiaq, Felix
928.
For whatever reasons, if I
understand you correctly, my
intended meaning has been
hopelessly distorted. I understand
that as with all philosophies,
understanding relies very much on
being able to associate ones own
ideas with that being read. I
presume the model I presented is of
fundamental difference to that held
by Samin. I do not intend to clutter
the pages of Felix with detailed
descriptions of my own ideas but if
Samin is interested, I shall try to
clarify my original article.
To begin with there is a critical
typing error. The fifth line should
read 'One version I will call reality,
the other O-space'. Reality is
hypothetical space in which all
things really do exist'. O-space is
O's perception of this the space in
which things exist (the real
definition) since two people can
have a concept of existence we
extrapolate the state of Reality.
However this misunderstanding I
am trying to show is that observer
I'm at it I think I'll make a few
points:
1. The figure of £8,000 was the
one being described as the cost of
the DramSoc production at that time
by senior members of the Union. I
cannot help being mis-informed.
2. Having been involved behind
the scenes and on the stage of
theatrical productions both amateur
and professional I feel well able to
space is not Reality but reality. This
is why people argue so hopelessly,
reality has as many versions as there
are observers while Reality is the
common template. In the respect
that the template, the perceptions
are different there is duplication
though no equation.
To understand how reality and
Reality are related a mechanical
description of perception is
required. If the brain is the machine
we can localise attention. There is
xxx (illegible—TS) no way my
brain can support an artificial
reality, Alva-space, in which my
brain is accurately modelled. I do
however have a subjective model.
1 know I have a subconscious which
I know little about which controls
many of my actions including the
hard processing involved in
perception. My perception of how
neural networks work really does
describe 'message' simplification
chose many modes leads to an on
or off response. Having processed
my information inputs I then have
to process the patterns in this
hardcore to have knowledge of what
I have seen. felt, heard, smelt.
Mary's obviously don't like the
truth either.
3. When M r Gardini suggested
that St Mary's students should come
to IC Union office when they had
problems, he was asked why. he
could not come to St Mary's Union
office.
Who do Mary's students think
they are? When other C C U
members have problems does Zoe
have to go to their C C U office to
help them. No. So why should
Mary's be any different?
4. On the topic of beer prices
being cut:
Mary's again show there
separation from IC by having their
own licence. Our Deputy President
would have no say over their prices,
but is he not their DP too?
Apparently not.
comment on a drama production
and resent the comment in a letter
in Felix 928 claiming that the
review was 'sheer fiction'.
3. Apart from the monetary
aspect of the review I stand by it
completely as a fair, not a bad,
review.
4.1 know a lot of work went into
Grease and I congratulate those
involved for uniting the college over
the week.
5. It is a shame that the review
had to take place on the first night
as, I hear, the final nights were
excellent. However, I cannot accept
tasted, though, remembered, been
doing and been motivated. This
loop I presume gives consciousness.
While I am doing this my actions
have already been chosen and
without feedback will commence.
This indeed gets experimental
results. My conscious knowledge
and thoughts have no value except
in the context of this processing I
know nothing about. I cannot argue
for or against 'a price' knowledge
other than to say the hardcore and
therefore meaning is genetically
defined while the picture is
environmentally stimulted,
measuring the existence of reality.
Since the meaning is genetically
defined the way we perceive the
world and all the questions and
answers have already been
fundamentally defined. However it
will take the rest of human existence
(until the next fundamental change
in brain patterns by evolution) to
explore our minds and mental make
up—both science and art.
Turning to logic, our brains
present to us a model of the world
composed of definite units—can you
relate this. Each unit has an
irrational common sense relation to
all the others. This meaning is I
presume the work of our minds and
therefore with 'reason', but to us
5. Felix editors were heavily
slated for the newspapers' lack of
interest in Mary's affairs.
Look at last week's issue. Three
articles about Mary's plus the cover
story.
Felix reporters have enough
trouble covering IC alone. Perhaps
if Mary's made a contribution (or
three) to Felix they would provide
a coverage of Mary's affairs.
It seems that Mary's students
resent their link with IC, and
although they have five year
courses, they should not be so quick
to criticise those who are prepared
to give up a year of their life to give
something back to the union. They
should remember if it wasn't for
people like these candidates Mary's
would not exist.

it being the first night as an excuse.
It is the first night that makes or
breaks a production—not many get
a second chance.
I will take a great interest in
future Dramsoc productions and
will certainly review them if I am
able. I have high standards—that
will never change.
Yours sincerely,
David Henderson-Begg.

there is only a bland connection.
There connections I referred to as
a tree. The tree as it is presented to
us really is lifeless. Play the 'why'
game as I call it. Make a statement
and question the meaning of
iteratively. Eventually you will end
up with a tautology. Try it one the
questions you asked 'Why does O-
space exist?'. I will start you 'what
does exist mean?' I think and
therefore I am 'should be your final
tautology'.
As for 'idealistic' what do you
want—how can any consciously
denied model not be idealistic?
Returning to Reality how much
have we insisted if our conscious
appears to be sensibly defined by a
'machine' which is only a tiny part
of Reality. To truly know every
facet of Reality in unquestionable
terms to really know what things are
you would have to escape from
Observer space and become
Reality.
P.S. Observer space must be a
part of Reality too.
To conclude if this is all too much
there are plenty more hypothesis on
existence but are all mentally boring
as they just label huge categories
'unknowable' e.g. God.
I hope this is clearer.
