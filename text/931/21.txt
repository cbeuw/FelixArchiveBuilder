Music Felix 931 18 March 1992
Concrete Blonde Bleach
- Walking in London - Killing Time
Well, this is quite pleasant. Not that
I often listen to pleasant music, but
this is fairly nice for a change.
From the name of the band, I
suppose you've guessed that at least
the vocalist is female. And that she
wants to be Wendy James.
Actually, more of the album
sounds like Tanita Tikaram, but
there are a couple of Transvision
Vamp masquerades. And 'It's a
Man's World' sounds like Alannah
Myles.
She doesn't sound like Tammy
Wynette on the country and western
attempt 'Ghost of a Texas Ladies
Man'. It's a pleasant voice. Radio
One would probably like this
album. It may not be stunningly
original, but it's pleasant fare; easy
on the ears whilst avoiding
nondescript blandness for the most
part. Yeah, it's quite good.

New Model Army
- History
NMA have been around now for
over ten years, doing wonders for
the clog industry. This album
covers many of their singles. The
album shows what it has taken to
give the band such a devout
following and why, even though
they have remained out of the
limelight, they are supported on
their seemingly never ending tour
dates. The songs, which are often
very political (5/sf State, High
Wall) are delivered with feeling
both lyrically and musically. It
makes a great change from
everything from Rave to Baggie.
They have described themselves
recently as Hippies with Attitude
but I assume this is because of their
age/ideals and not to do with their
floweriness. The album's good if
you have not heard much from them
before but I expect the fans are
waiting for an album of new
material. An album of mostly oldies
after a live album seems to suggest
all that touring is wearing them
down.
Louse.
• 'History', a retrospective of all
NMA's EMI singles, with two new
songs, is released on March 23.
From the first chord of 'First' to the
dying feedback of 'Tangle' the best
way to describe this is interesting.
That should in no way be
considered an insult, if anything to
the contrary. Saili Carson's vocal
make you sit up and listen while the
guitars and drums provide a sort of
backing that is worth listening on
its own. This is most definitely not
easy listening though. If you want
to get the full and rich rewards
several listening are required, not
a record to put on for background
relief. I can't believe that people
actually buy records simply to put
on and then go off and do the
hoovering. Anyway, after getting
that little one off my chest. I can
strongly recommend this piece of
vinyl as a worthy addition to the
more discerning record buyers
collection.

Carter: In their own little hole.
Carter USM
- The Only Living
Boy in New Cross
On first listen, the new Carter single
sounds like a cross between 'Sheriff
Fatman' and 'After The
Watershed'. Should I have expected
anything else? Perhaps, perhaps
not. On further listens, it wobbles
its way out from this starting point
and into a new corner, but still not
too radically different from
anything they've done before.
Chrysalis will be happy. The fact
that 'Rubbish' s chart placing was
lower than the other two chart
singles yet again proves that quality
has no guarantee of recognition.
On the other side lurks a cover
of The Smiths' 'Panic', not really
such a radical cover as that of Pet
Shop Boys or Inspiral Carpets, and
I wonder why they bothered. 'Death
By Stereo', as the introductory
sample says.
And, at last salvation is reached.
The best track on the single (12"
only) by far is 'Watching The Big
Apple Turn Over', which, as
you've probably guessed, is a song
about New York. The best track by
far, more orchestrated than any of
Carter's previous releases, although
it does show a disturbing tendency
that Carter may have given up
taking the piss out of the Pet Shop
Boys, and decided that they want to
be the Per Shop Boys. Flip the
single before it's too late, Mr.
Chrysalis. Carter need to climb out
from their own little hole before
they dig their own grave.
