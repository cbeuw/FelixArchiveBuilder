18 March 1992 Felix 931 News Review
The Christmas holiday, and
holidays in general, are a bonanza
for hacks and fixers. Yet, come the
6th of January, when all return to
the beer garden that is IC, the
journos bounce back, fresh with
cynicism, asking, 'OK, what fast
one have they pulled this time?'.
The 'they' is both the Ashite
managers and the Union bods, who
work with a similarity so close that
they deny it, even though both
teams have jugglers. To prove the
point, just when you thought it was
safe to leave the beer garden, and
that Felix was no more, it's back,
with a look back (in anger?
contempt? amazement?
drunkenness?) at the iCNN news
this term.
The first fast one was the
Sherfield Five (Ash, Fraser,
Reynolds, Straw, Marshall) trying
to fix up the Messenger, Security
and Car Parking privatisation
before anyone could notice.
the academics,
sensing blood,
were in full
flight
However, the plans rapidly came
unstuck, or even noticed, so this
term, the 'Quick Release Ball and
Chain' award goes to Gordon
Marshall, Head of Estates, for his
rapid about-face on the proposals.
The original document suggesting
a review of security was published
on 19 April 1991, by Facilities
Manager, Val Straw. By the time
Gordon Marshall had re-drafted it
on 27 September, the document
read, 'in the light of this further
review, it is considered necessary
and desirable to pursue a radically
different staffing strategy.' How
radical? How different? Read on.
it is proposed that staffing below
the management/secretary level
should utilise uniformed contract
staff.' And whose signature was on
the front of the new radical
document? Gordon Marshall.
'Privatisation', said the unions.
'Outsourcing', said the Rector.
'You're sacked', said Marshall, to
all Security, Messenger and Car
Park staff. The academics, sensing
blood, were in full flight, '...the
new style of management could be
inappropriate for an academic
institution ... the style is in fact
more akin to imposition', wrote the
Chairman of the Academic Staff
Committee. When Gordon
Marshall wrote casting doubts on
the loyalty of long serving staff, the
City and Guilds Dean, Professor
Bruce Sayers, hit back. T draw you
attention to the brutality, no
impertinence, of Gordon Marshall
... writing of the anticipated
'loyalty' of bought in contract
personnel. (This is) not the only ill-
conceived component, there are
even greater stupidities. These
factory floor manoeuvres are
wholly unworthy of IC.'
At this point, the Rector, sensing
defeat, jumped back on the fence,
so that Uncle Eric could come along
and sort out a little difficulty in 'our
community'. However, the
switching from subtraction to
addition.
The irony was not lost that the
man who wanted privatisation and
an end to union influence will
probably go from the college before
the union negotiators. It could, of
course, be argued that he should
have gone earlier. Such a policy
switch would have intimidated
most. His selective amnesia could
yet put considerable distance
between his actions and their
consequences.
In an interesting aside, how
closely did you read 'The Survey'?
(Felix 928). Keith Reynolds, Chief
Security Officer, worked in the
Spring News Review
Strikers gather outside the Rector's house on Queensgate during the Security & Messenger dispute.
Governing Body had cottoned on to
what the Ashites had done, and sent
the Rector away with a firm slap on
the wrist. 'The Rector was charged
directly with looking at the
problems of communication.' And
that was something he couldn't
contract out.
So it came to pass that the
'negotiations' (sic) continued on
into term two. After some
confusion, agreement was reached
on 7th February between the Head
of Estates and the Unions on an in-
house settlement. The security
service was improved, savings were
made, and the unions kept most of
their members in work.
Keeping them in line was a
•different job. There was a bit of
grumbling about a sell out, but
apparently the union leaders got the
go ahead to sign. But sign they
didn't. The calculators on Sherfield
are still getting stuck on their sums.
Maybe they are having difficulty
media industry before he came to
Imperial. Val Straw, Facilities
Manager, came from the
communications industry. That's
two out of five, though they aren't
the only ones. According to London
Weekend Television, Simon
Westerman, Catering Manager,
worked as one of their contract
caterers. London Weekend
Television recently contracted out
their security services, to the
unions, who set up a small
company, and made a small profit
into the bargain. What was the
name of the union negotiator?
Somebody Snow, I think.
More plaudits for Gordon
Marshall, and the Estates division,
and this time the consequences of
actions are already beginning to
show. The 'Dripping Dodgy
Drainpipe' goes to the maintenance
section of Estates. In a set piece
example of crisis management, the
