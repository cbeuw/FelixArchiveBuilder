says 'No' to fast food
You played the British Music
Weekend, at Wembley Arena.
What's it like playing this stage
compared to that one?
F: The weird thing about playing
Wembley isn't that your playing in
front of thousands of people, it's
that you can't really see them, that's
the strangest thing.
D: It's just like playing in a black
hole or something.
F: And it takes about quarter of an
hour to walk across the stage, which
is a bit too much like hard work to
me. That's why we like playing
places like the Borderline. I just
stick my feet on the spot and can't
go anywhere.
8.15: The support band have started
to check their drums in the
background. Consequently things
get a bit difficult to hear. We start
to eat their burgers.
You're touring with Shakespear's
Sister this month. How did you
get onto that bill?
F: We just phoned up their
manager, and suggested that we're
the best band to support them, and
they listened all the music, and
consequently they liked us. What
we liked'about them is that they're
like us, just a credible pop band,
that's just what we want to be. We
admire people from Massive Attack
through to Talk Talk, and The
Cocteau Twins. We've never had
anything in common with the
shoegazing scene or even the baggy
scene, I mean, last year everyone
was staring at their shoes, and we
had nothing to do with it.
In many ways, a band can reflect
how your life has actually been :-
In our first reviews, they said that
I as a performer was self-,
destructive, and that's what I mm
been accused of all my life. OnelME
the reasons I joined this band was
that for all my life,T've never been
part of any scene, and it seemed like
the only solution to this is to buikf
a scene all around myself, andjaHj
friends. That's what we want to W D
is to start our own scene. AJEB
sometime I see the way that t h S
band is. as if it's come to mirror!
whatever has gone on in my life,
and the other people in this band's
life.
What's the deal between Poly dor
and your record label, Fiction?
V: All the control stays with
Fiction, they just did a deal with
Polydor to gal better distribution.
a better service for the people who
buy his records. Creatively,
Polydor have no influence. Fiction
help us with all our decisions. I
think as a band, they'd like us to be
less commercial - when we asked-
someone we really liked to remix
our record, they said 'Maybe he's
a bit well known as a remixer.' It's
like the other way round to usual,
I mean, we try and persuade them
that we want to do a video, and they
say 'Are you sure?'
You've just finished a tour of
America. What was that like?
D: We spent six weeks in a van, a
Dodge van, and in our last week
there, we were on our way to
Minneapolis, on an 800 mile drive,
and our van came off the road, and
rolled five times, and destroyed all
our equipment, and our tour
manager perforated his jugular, so
we quit then.
F: We went to L . A . and that was
a bunch of wank. Americans didn't
understand the idea of rave at all.
To them it was just a disco, but it
used to mean a lot more to us, at
least before the marketing me got
hold of it. A lot of our songs are
inspired by the early rave stuff,
'Rainbow' and 'Fountain' were
inspired by tracks by people such
as Marshall Jefferson and Jamie
Principle, where people combined
an emotional feel, together with a
very mechanical feel. We want to
be a band with an emotional feel,
like The Smiths, but we didn't want
to do it with jangly guitars.
And we went to Salt Lake City,
where the mormons are, and the
Book Of Mormon is everywhere.
We told the crowd we were going
to do some Osmonds covers, and
immediately, half the crowd ran
down the front, and started

What are your songs about?
F: There are songs about all kind
of things. With 'Fountain',
everybody thought it was about

'Bitter Moon' is about being a
musician, waiting for inspiration,
and the feeling that your life was
being cursed by a moon, or an evil
eye, or whatever.
