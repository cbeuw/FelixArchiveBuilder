Indoor Soccer Tournament
There was a factual error in my
article last week. The Lebanese
Society was not suspended by the
OSC as was reported. I would like
to apologise to all concerned and
hope that everyone can now let
the matter rest. The Lebanese
teams have since been reinstated
to the IC Indoor Soccer
Tournament.
As for the tournament itself, 5
teams have now successfully
qualified for the second phase, to
be held on Wednesday 17th March.
They are IC F C 2 , Chemical
Engineers, Cypriots, IC FC1 and
Sikh 2. With 3 games still to be
played (at the point of writing), five
teams are contesting the remaining
3 places: Lebanese 1, Islamic 1,
Indian, Snooker 1 and Sikh 1.
Each qualifying team shall be
seeded according to the number of
points attained and their goal-
difference. Then the team seeded 1
will play the team seeded 8.
Similarly, the remaining fixtures
shall be Seed 2 vs Seed 7, Seed 3
vs Seed 6 and Seed 4 vs Seed 5. The
winning team from each match will
go on to play in the semi-finals. If
the better seeded team wins their
respective games, the semi-final
line-up shall be Seed 1 vs Seed 4
and Seed 2 vs Seed 3. The winning
semi-finalists shall then contest the
final.
The tournament champions shall
be presented will a shield, engraved
miniature trophies for each player
plus a cheque for £75. The losing
finalist shall receive runners-up
medals plus a cheque for £30.
Cheques for £ 1 0 shall be awarded
to the losing semi-finalists. As the
tournament is organised by the
OSC. there shall also be a trophy
for the best placed OSC team.
It is hoped all games shall be
played on Wednesday between
9.30-lpm. If this cannot happen,
then uncompleted games shall be
played from 4pm onwards. May I
take this opportunity to thank all the
teams for entering the tournament,
and wish the teams in the knock-out
stage the best of luck.

Malaysia Nite 1992, Flight MH002
On the 22nd of Febuary 1992, the
Malaysia Soc (ICMS) celebrated the
success of its second ever Malaysia
Nite in the history of the society.
The event which was attended by
Malaysians and their friends from
London as well as all over the U K ,
succeeded in its aim to introduce
Malaysian culture to all those
present.
Guests were first treated to dinner
at the Union Building (Beit Quad)
before being ushered to the Great
Hall where the cultural show was
held. Dinner consisted of a variety
of Malaysian delights ranging from
'Ayam Masak Merah' to Bingka (a
type of cake). This was a thrill for
the adventurous and a delight to
those who had acquired the taste
over the years. It was indeed an
irresistable spread of exotic food.
Content. Guests were then herded
to their seats int he Great Hall
before the cultural show began. A
brief introduction to the show by
hosts Azwan and Ellene was
followed by a dramatic opening
ceremony, which lived up to its
expectations as the theme for the
evening suggested—a fictitious
flight to Malaysia, flight MH002.
Guests were enthralled with a take-
off scene in a place, complete with
captain's instructions. The evening
then kicked off to a brilliant start
with the two man band of Azmi and
Malek pounding away on their
keyboards.
This was followed by a traditional
dance 'Kuda Kepang', depicting
men on horseback which kept the
crowd capitvated with their
illustration of the spreading of Islam
by Javanese men in the interiors of
Java. Han M . K . was on next with
his item on Chinese caligraphy.
Accompanied by narration and
soothing Chinese music, it proved
to be a hit with the crowd. Next up
was the 'Wan Bulan' or the flying
dance which is usually performed
by the youth int he village of the
East Coast of Malaysia after the
harvest. Incidentally, the 'wan' or
kite is also the logo of the national
airlines, Malaysia Airlines.
The crowd then joined in the
'Acoustic Jam', singing and
humming away to familiar
Malaysian tunes and oldies.
'Bongai' a graceful dance presented
by four talented young women of
the ICMS gave the crowd a chance
to catch their breath while enjoying
this form of traditional dance called
Tnang'. The graceful 'Doongal'
dancers then slid into the shadows
as the pantomime began. An eerie
performance relating to death, the
soul and whatever comes next.
Meanwhile a raffle was held in
between each performance.
The second half of the evening
began with the main item of the
day—the 'Ukle Mayang' a
traditional dance which visualised
the romance between a young
fisherman lost at sea and a mystic
princess. This intriguing
dance/drama was followed by a
sketch based on a typical village
setting and the conflicts between an
adopted and real son. A colourful
fashion show with a live display of
'Batik' kept the crowd enthralled as
the climax of the evening drew
nearer.
The grand raffle—a return ticket
to Malaysia was won by, well it is
still mystery—the chap didn't turn
up so his friend collected his prize
on his behalf! The two man band
was on again, before the entire cast
got up on stage to sing 'Rasa
Sayang'—one of our traditional
ways of saying goodbye. A few
verses of 'Pantun' or poems were
also recited, bringing messages of
friendship and happiness to end an
evening which will be treasured by
all those present.
The ICMS would like to extend
gratitude to all the guests, members
and their friends who helped make
Flight MH002 a success. We hope
that you will be with us again next
year for another enjoyable evening.
