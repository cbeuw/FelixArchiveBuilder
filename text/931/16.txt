Opinion Felix 931 18 March 1992
'These islands are richer than I
know or can say. and I have taken
possession of them in their
Majesties' name.' So wrote
Columbus to the monarchs of Spain
and Europe. Of the people who
lived on the Caribbean Islands he
said: 'They are yours to command
and make them work.'
1992—if you have not yet heard
marks the quincentennary of
Columbus' landfall in the
Americas. The anniversary is
generating big business: More than
200 books on Columbus-related
subjects are scheduled for release
this year; two Hollywood fdms are
being made; not to mention the
raw materials that fuelled European
industrialisation. Today, Latin
America continues to feed and work
for Europe. Cotton, coffee and
bananas, are raised on huge
plantations wasting the
environment, while descendants of
the indigenous population work in
appalling conditions.
Trade barriers forged in Europe
and the US ensure that Latin
America contains a producer of raw
materials and cheap labour. The net
transfer of resources away from
these poor countries is further
ensured by increasingly high prices
for imported manufactured goods
and technology, and also by interest
local community. This was not the
sort of example that the US wished
the rest of Latin America to follow.
To emphasise this the US
government funded guerilla
warfare, and led a total economic
boycott of Nicaragua (backed by
Britain). The financial squeeze was
too much for the Nicaraguans, and
last year, by a narrow margin, the
Sandinistas were voted out.
However, internal pressure to
maintain the gains of the revolution
is still great.
Less publicised is the fact that
America is also responsible for
having installed the present military
regime in Guatamala due to a

countless television specials being
planned, lavish exhibits and official
celebration in at least thirty
countries.
In the US, the centre of the
celebrations will be 'Ameriflora
'92', a $100 million international
flower show being built in
Columbus, Ohio. And the excess
does not stop there, there is to be
a symbolic marriage between the
statue of Columbus in Barcelona,
and New York's Statue of Liberty.
Not one to be left out, our very own
city of Birmingham is to supply the
ring. Liverpool, also, is planning
the launch of a flotilla of 15th
Century style ships, in a mock up
of Columbus' departure from
Spain.
The first island that Columbus
'hit' in the West Indies, was that of
Hispaniola, now known as the
Dominican Republic. He set the
pattern for the explorers and
colonialists who followed him when
he initiated the extermination of the
Tiano people who lived on that
island. The Dominican Republic is
now indulging in gross celebrations,
including the construction of a
colossal lighthouse in honour of
Columbus. It is said that the
lighthouse, if switched on, will
plunge at least half of the island into
darkness, as the island does not
generate enough electricity to meet
the needs of both the island and the
lighthouse.
In 1492 an estimated 100 million
people lived in what we call Latin
America, compared to only 60
million in Europe. Within 80 years,
only 10 million people remained in
Latin America; the rest succumbed
to disease, or were killed in wars
and massacres brought about by the
Europeans.
Many of those who survived were
enslaved, and, along with enslaved
Africans were forced to produce
payments on debts that annually
consume large portions of the
countries' GNP.
The injustice of the system is all
too apparent for the peoples of
Central America, but any attempts
to create a more just society
working for itself, rather than for
the rich countries of the North, have
in the past been sabotaged.
The reforms in Nicaragua under
the Sandinistas are a well known
case in point. The Sandinistas' most
significant policies were those
concerning redistribution of land.
Land used for cash crops was
bought for the landed elite to be
redistributed to villagers
(campesinos), supposedly leading to
the farming of food stuffs for the
similar history of attempted land
reform. In the early 50s the
American banana company,
Chiquita, owned around 55% of
potential arable land in Guatamala.
They used only a small percentage
of this for growing bananas, and
vast areas of land lay unused. A
democratically elected government
decided to distribute this land to
small-holders for subsistence
farming. This piqued Chiquita,
which in turn led the US
government to install the current
regime in the 1954 CIA coup.
Many in Central America have
now realised that change cannot be
achieved in their own countries

ignorance amongst people of the
North. For the majority of people
in Latin America the legacy of
Columbus is poverty. Many do not
accept the legacy and struggle to
maintain their traditions and seek
social justice.
March 22nd to 29th is Central
America Week—a celebration of
the resilience of the people, and the
survival of their culture. During this
week people in towns throughout
Britain and Ireland will be making
links with people working for their
own development in Central
America.
For our part Third World First
has invited Margarito Ruiz, a
Mexican Maya-Tojolbal Indian, and
leader of the Independent
Organisation of Indian Peoples to
come and speak on Thursday 19th
March (the week before Central
America Week), 12.45pm Huxley

Resistance and Survival
Native organisations in Central
America, South America, Mexico,
the US and Canada have been
organising education campaigns and
public protests against official
Columbus Quincentennial
celebrations since 1988. Their aim
is to expose the hidden history of
colonialism and build a new
relationship between natives and
non-natives based on justice.
The size of the indigenous
population in Latin America is
substantial. A minimum of 10%
(over 40 million) are generally
considered pure Indian, ethnically
and culturally, and a much higher
proportion are half-Indian. In many
regions within countries indigenous
populations can constitute 90% of
the population. They are present in
every Latin American country,
except in most of the Caribbean
where they suffered early
extermination.
These survivors of the European
colonialists' ventures are still
subjected to discrimination,
exploitation and oppression, and are
generally in the lower echelons of
society, deprived of influence and
power. As one Mexican sociologist
put it, 'The Indian Question is
essentially one of internal
colonialism. The Indian
communities are Mexico's internal
colonies...Here we find prejudice,
descrimination, colonial types of
exploitation and dictatorial forms.'
Latin American indigenous
peoples reflect a rich diversity
across the continent, and live under
often very different conditions.
They do, however, share five
centuries of common history, and
a deeply held aspiration for land
(taken away from their ancestors
first by the colonial powers, and
now by the national landed elite,
and multinational companies),
autonomy, and culture. Margarito
Ruiz will be addressing, amongst
other matters, the indigenous
question.
Margarito Ruiz Hernandez
Margarito Ruiz is an indigenous
leader of the Maya-Tojolabal
Indians. He is a well known figure
in the field of indigenous rights in
Mexico, and beyond.
After the Andean countries,
Mexico is home to the highest
number of indigenous people in
Latin America, with an estimated
8-10 million Indian peoples, made
up of over 56 different ethnic groups
The Mexico Solidarity Group
therefore decided that it was
important for a Mexican indigenous
voice to be heard in Britain, and
invited Margarito Ruiz as a visitor
during Central America week. He
is in Britain for two weeks, giving
talks and taking part in conferences
on indigenous rights, 1992 and the
500 year campaign, land issues,
human rights, and rural
development.
Margarito spends a lot of time
travelling and visiting groups within
Mexico, and has also been a
represenative at international
meetings. In 1991 he was in Spain
several times as a conference
speaker. This will be only the
second time he has spoken in
Britain.
Amongst other posts, Margarito
Ruiz is the General Secretary of the
FIPI (Frente Independiente de
Pueblos Indios), which is a
grouping of over 26 indigenous
organisations from throughout
Mexico. It was formed in 1987, and
has been at the forefront for
indigenous rights in Mexico as well
as promoting rural development
projects in its member
communities.
He is involved in a number of
other organisations, and has been a
Deputy (MP equivalent) for the
PRD, a broad left/centre opposition
grouping.
» All that there is left to say is that
Margarito Ruiz will be speaking on
Thursday 19th March, 12.45pm in
Huxley LT130.
