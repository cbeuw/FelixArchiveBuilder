18 March 1992 Felix 931 Feature
The End...
'Another bright morning in gentle,
breezy Martinique, French
Caribbean. On the blue-sea
horizon, just sensed by the averted
gaze, white triangles lie etched.
Slowly, as the morning wears on,
they waft nearer.
After 36 hours of continuous
racing, the fleet is still too tightly
packed to diminish the tension felt
on deck. Sails are quickly changed,
then more waiting, watching the
sea, looking for gusts, eyes
straining against the bright dawn
success. The Old Centralians back
us unequivocably, with strong
words and commitment of funds.
Marketing are enthusiastic
supporters, convincing us that we
can do it.
Now we were not to be stopped.
Evelyn: 'We've got to go!'
The Long Night...
But no one else was interested.
Weeks passed. Mail returned, kind
patronising refusals, 'hands tied...',
'budgets spent...', etc etc.
The OC's agreed to support us in
Acknowledgements so Far...
Our sponsors: the Old Centralians
for their belief right from the
beginning, the Harlington Trust for
their last minute leap of faith
making it all possible, to the Rector
for his encouragement and
enthusiasm, to Professor Ley and
the Chemistry Department for their
nurturing incentives, and lastly to
Marketing for their professionalism
and for giving us our credibility and
teaching us so much.

Jonathan Griffiths (Union), Peter

light. The lead boats are still
fighting hard, and with one mile to
go, the race is still anybody's...'
The Beginning...
It was a rainy, dull afternoon in
London when the crazy, insane,
mad idea was first spoken of. To do
what? Sail in the French Caribbean
in a yacht race? Yea, sure. Next
stop the moon.
But some had vision, (or
stupidity!) enough to believe that it
could be done. They decided to go
for it: 'only those that risk are free'.
The Idea...
Fly to Guadeloupe. Race to
Dominica through the little islands.
Then, overnight to Martinique.
Finally, the climax: an Olympic
triangle race off the coast of
Martinique. Altogether, nine days
of racing.
The Team...
The whole yacht club, plus these
members: Severine Vadon (from
last year's winning boat), Evelyn
Joslin, Richard Sem, Emmanuel
Gringarten, T i m Parsons,
Emmanuel Omont, Thor Askeland,
Tony Rasmilovic, Andrea
Michellotti, Jean-Christophe
Normand, and Lynda Davis. A
diverse mix of French-, English-,
Italian-, Australian-, American-,
Swedish-, and Norwegian-
motivations, skills, and
experiences. Only five will finally
compete in the race—but the efforts
of all were needed during the long,
dark winter.
First Blood-
So, we had our 'file' complete with
colour photocopies and maps, with
all the different angles covered in
both French and English
exhortations, refined with help from
David Norburn of Management,
and made complete through Lynda
Davis of Marketing.
Immediately, we have our first
November. Winter passed with no
further commitments of help. Some
felt let down, spirits flagged, the
routine of work, reports, labs, and
experiments re-asserted itself.
Hopes faded as time passed.
Instant Success...At Last...
Nearly three months later, sheer
bloody-mindedness and
perseverence was recognised, as it
sometimes is. The Rector,
Marketing, the Harlington Trust
and the Chemistry Department all
succumbed to our relentless
pleading and fast talking. Our
political naivete and inexperience
notwithstanding, the college
decided the outside world could no
longer be waited for.
Mee (Registrar), Roger Knight
(Institute of C&G), John Archer
(Pro-Rector), NatWest for our
overseas transaction charges,
Michael Gallis, occupants of 438
Chemistry, Karen Peploe (Press
Office) and most of all, to Lynda
Davis of Marketing who deserves
to go with us (so somebody give her
a ticket, OK!).
The Rush to the Race...
And so we leave for the French
Caribbean, to compete in front of
European T V , press, and corporate
sponsors, against teams from major
French Ecole Superior, the only
international competitors, the sole
UK representatives.
We leave on March 27th.
