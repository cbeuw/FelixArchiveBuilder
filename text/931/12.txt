Mary's IC Seconds Football
St Mary's Hospital emphatically
won the Hospitals Cup on
Wednesday (4th March) beating
University College and the
Middlesex Hospital by 49-0. In the
process Mary's created three new
records; six consecutive cup
triumphs, a record points margin
for the cup final and perhaps most
significantly, the most successful
hospital of all time by overtaking
Guy's record of thirty wins in the
competition. All this in the oldest
rugby competition in the world.
The match was played in a good
spirit before a noisy, boistrous
crowd. The Mary's cheerleaders,
trumpeters and tango men led the
touchline proceedings: the parading
of the The Puffin recently re-
acquired from the Middlesex team
and the removal of an unfortunate
Middlesex man's (as opposed to an
Essex Girl's) clothes who happened
to be caught trying to kidnap one of
the Mary's cheerleaders.
Prior to the final, Mary's had
scored thirteen tries, eleven of
which were scored by a very quick
back division, and as a result much
was expected. At the start Mary's
kept the ball close to their forwards
and fifteen minutes into the game
were already thirteen points up with
a try each for Torkington and Hunt
and a conversion and penalty by
Butland (who had a poor game, by
his own high standards, with his
place kicking). By this stage the cup
was won and after Morgan had
powered over and two further tries
were scored—the score at half-time
was 27-0.
The first period of the second half
saw some UC/Middlesex pressure
but they never looked like breaching
the Mary's defence. A pushover try
by Kelly (but claimed by the front
row) meant that Mary's could really
relax and begin to run the ball from
inside their own twenty-two. Two
of the moves resulted in glorious
tries involving virtually the whole
team. Anyone who was fortunate
enough to see it will not forget the
two second rows rounding off a
move under the posts after starting
it by winning ball at the line out,
near their own try line.
On Wednesday (11th March), St
Mary's Hospital 2nd X V are
playing in the 2nd X V Hospitals
Cup against Charing Cross and are
hopeful of victory after beating
Kings 83-0 in the semi-final. In the
next few weeks the Mary's sevens
team will also bid for a hat-trick of
victories at National Medical
Schools Sevens Championships.
'A bunch of nice guys.' That is
how someone once tried to describe
the Imperial College 2nd XI
association football team. The
seconds have also been accused of
being good-looking, intellectual,
well-dressed and modest. They
plead guilty on all counts.
This season, IC 2nds reached the
second round of the U A U
competition, the semi-final of the
U L U cup, were placed fourth in
Division Oe of the U L U league, and
have been the top scoring men's
team in the football club. These
results are pretty good, considering
that the seconds have had an
unsettled side, having fielded 34
different players in the course of the
season.
There have been regulars, of
course, and a key player for IC 2nds
this year has been Steve Shilling.
Despite his occasional loss of
reason, he is one of the best
goalkeepers in the whole university.
As midfielders converted to full-
backs, Eamon McCann, Chris
Morris and Andy Fenton have been
essential in the team's tactic of
playing from the back. Richard
Burrows and Ian Finnerty have
provided solidarity in the centre of
defence.
Richie Dixon, the Nigel Clough
lookalike, accidentally acquired by
the side, scores spectacular goals as
easily as he gets sweaty hands.
Other midfielders, Captain Rakesh
The Boat Club this weekend
produced a highly impressive set of
results at Reading University Head.
The outright win over the Oxford
University blue boat and three
crews in the top ten underlines the
college's position amongst the top
three university clubs in the
country.
The 1st VIII won the whole event
beating Oxford by six seconds with
only two other crews within thirty
seconds of their winning time.
The 2nd and 3rd VIII beat all
other U A U opposition to come 8th
and 9th.
The men's novice VIII continued
their unbeaten run with an
impressive row for their fourth win
this term.
The women's novice VIII came
a close third in their category.
Forthcoming events include a
possible race against Cambridge at
Muthoo, Max Duckworth and
Tellis Botzios are famous for their
team talks, hair gel and showers
respectively. Ben Adams and
Mickey Plummer played very few
games and their expertise was
missed. The youthful Stuart Miller
also made sporadic appearances.
The seconds have had a deadly
forward line, with Jason Devoys
capable of turning on a sixpence and
top scorer Simon Barry incapable
of smiling. However, Barry has
scored almost twice as many goals
this season as the whole of the 1 st
XI team.
The hallmark of this year's
the Tideway Head of the river race
in a fortnight, where 500 crews
compete. The men's top squad aim
to have three crews in the top thirty
with the first VIII well within the
top ten. The novice men hope to
record our third novice win in five
years.
Next term the 1st VIII,
representing British universities,
will go to the Japanese Henley
Regatta to defend their 1991 victory
over other international universities.
Top England rugby stars Roger
Uttley and Andy Ripley enlisted the
help of ICBC 1st VIII members
Steve Ellis and Ed Wild, with
Olympic coach Bill Mason to
attempt rowing for the first time,
noting that they would require a lot
of training to complete 20 strokes,
let alone 20 minutes of gruelling
head race...
second team has been its positive
style, playing some beautiful
possession football and placing an
emphasis on teamwork. Football
history is littered with cynical and
negative attitudes, as typified by
Austria and Germany in a 1982
World Cup tie. The Brazilian star
Zico then said 'God should punish
people who do these things'.
But punishment comes in
mysterious ways. Three key players
missed penalties in the semi-final of
the U L U cup this year, denying the
possibility of glory to their team,
Imperial College seconds. A team
almost as good as the talent within.
Imperial
At the club dinner on Wednesday
the Rugby Club completed its most
successful season to date.
Having narrowly lost the defence
of the Gutteridge Cup the previous
year the team were determined to
make amends. The team used an
abundance of possession well to
destroy Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School by 31
points to 4. Stuart Paynter kicked
well and it was a pleasure to see
both wingers scoring right in the
corners. (Cheers Anton!) Stuart
Paynter was deservedly nominated
man of the match.
Having already displayed their
supremacy in London and the SE of
England, three days later the team
travelled to Nottingham to take on
Durham in the semi-final of the
Commercial Union U A U
championships.
