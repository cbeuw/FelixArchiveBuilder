Dribblers Win League
The Dribblers took the league
title in what was one of the most
hard fought games of the season.
Both teams needed victory to take
the title and it was K C H who
surprisingly put the Dribblers
defence under immense pressure
throughout the first half. The
defence, glad to have something to
do for a change, coped amazingly
and it was the Dribblers who
finished the half on top with two
goals from Permi and Jo and
excellent defending from Arlene
and Juliana.
The second half was more even
until a sudden penalty gave the
Dribblers a 3-0 lead. Super runs and
dodgy finishing from Permi (the
goaly was big and fat and took up
the whole of the goal area)
maintained this score line until
K C H managed to snatch back a goal
to put them back into contention.
However, a final goal from Permi
put the Dribblers 4-1 ahead and out
of reach of K C H . With only five
minutes left both teams were
exhausted and it seemed like all the
action was over...or was it?
No, it couldn't be, surely the
teams in their state of exhaustion
were not seeing things. But no! The
players now realised it was no
Rugby Report
comparison but their fifth
consecutive south-east group title
and six previous wins in seven
matches overall, with an average of
34 points a match, threw down a
challenge which Durham picked up
ponderously.
David Fleming, playing
alongside Andrew his twin brother,
ran in a twelth minute try from the
base of the ruck, from the drive by
Fowler of Rosslyn Park and
Montgomery, the influential scrum
half in Imperial's progress. His
kicking was insistent and
impeccable, trusting Durham
backwards into a cauldren of
defensive uncertainty.
Paynter, having been charged
down earlier in the game, regained
his confidence to add a penalty goal
for Imperial soon after half time.
Imperial's quart size pack
compared to their opponent's pints
turned Durham's faces the same
shade of Palatinate purple as their
jerseys until a final fifteen minutes
of long awaited fluency overturned
Imperial's worthy seven point lead.
Durham now play Loughborough in
the final at Twickenham on
Wednesday 18th March.
Roger Gilchrist was elected
captain of ICRFC for next season
at the A G M last Monday, John
Fowler was voted player of the
season and Stuart Paynter voted the
most improved player.
The club would like to thank
those who turned up week after
week to support us. The
groundsmen at Harlington Mick,
Phil and Keith, and especially the
staff of the Union Office for both
their help and support throughout
the season.

mirage, it surely was Ethel and she
was running, yes running, up the
pitch with the ball. She charged past
the lone defender and headed for the
goalkeeper. The crowd erupted in
a frenzy, the players stood and
watched in disbelief.
A whole year of standing on cold,
wet, muddy pitches had driven the
poor girl mad and she was behaving
in a way never witnessed before.
Charging down the pitch with the
defender hot on her heels she took
it past the goaly, the crowd went
mad, the team fainted and.. .the ball
dribbled slowly off the pitch. Alas,
it wasn't to be the goal that had
eluded the poor woolly hatted one
all season. We could be tight and
say this isn't strictly true, Ethel
scored a goal last term. Shame it
was in the wrong goal though!!
Exhausted and hungry but still on
form. The Dribblers secured their
place as top boat racers in London
by beating not one but two teams.
First up for the hammering were
K C H . Caroline was still struggling
to get over the shock of Ethel's run
which allowed K C H to sneak ahead
but IC's back four, Emma, Linday,
Eleanor and Rachel, dashed all
hopes of a K C H victory with an
easy win.
A mixed bag of supporters were
next up for the challenge and what
a sad bunch they were. Felix's very
own photographer led the team with
a pathetic half pint (call yourself a
man?). But the girls, in true style,
polished off their drinks in record
time to win by a drink in hand.
The captain would just like to
congratulate the team on their
performance this season. Apart
from winning the league they also
got to the semi-finals in the cup. It's
been great playing with you all.
Extra big thanks to Sara and Ethel
who, despite my sarcy reports, have
had a brilliant season and helped in
the running of the club.
Good luck to you all next year!!
The first Felix of next term will
come out on Friday 1st May. All
reports or articles should reach
the Felix Office, Beit Quad, by
12.30 Monday 27th April if they
are to be included in that issue.
nterstellar
'To boldly go where no one has
gone before'—Science fiction or
science fact? Is Interstellar Travel
really practicle? If so, how long
before it will be possible for man
to head off to the stars.
Ideas about Interstellar Travel
range from slow moving colonies
travelling at about 10% light speed
using fission/fusion explosions; to
swifter craft using matter/anti-
matter and other exotic propulsion
systems.
On Saturday March 4th at
7.00pm in Elec Eng 403b Ian
Crawford of U C L will be I C U -
SEDS guest for a lecture on this
topic, followed by a discussion of
the possibilities.
Rifle and Pistol
Last week saw IC's intrepid pistol
team actually get round to shooting
some matches. Firstly there was
standard pistol against U L U Pistol
Club. We beat them by 928 to 880
with neither side shooting
particularly well—more practice
needed I think. Over the weekend
the Cambridge University squad
came down to shoot precision
centrefire. This idea had to be
abandoned at the last minute when
we realised we hadn't got any
centrefire targets! We decided to
shoot PPI instead which is much
more fun. Both teams shot well,
considering the short notice, and
Cambridge narrowly beat us, the
final score being 774 to 800. We
will demand a rematch, the honour
of IC is at stake (or something like
that).
The rifle team have not been
doing so well since they have been
skulking around in dark corners
ever since last term when they shot
against Herriot Watt in the first
round of the British Universities
team rifle competition. Suffice it to
say we got absolutely bloody
hammered. Beaten by almost 100
points! Special mention must go to
club captain Tim Griffiths for the
lowest score of the season (and
possibly of this century) although he
at least had an excuse—the sights
fell off his rifle halfway through the
competition!
