The Bottle match. The Bottle
match. A name redolent with
occidental mysticism, and esoteric
tradition, the origins of which is lost
in the merged mists of a thousand
nights in Union bars. What is this
thing that connects the Camborne
School of Mines (CSM) and our
very own Royal School of Mines
(RSM)?
Some would say that this
connecting thing was merely the
M4. for the most part, but nay, 'tis
more concrete, more lasting, than
any stretch of mere motorway. How
many of you remember seeing the
blue and white stickers of the C S M ,
Some contestants' preparatory self
sacrifices reach masochistic
proportions - oh, the agony of
practising not drinking for a full 90
minutes at a go. In recent years non
rugger buggers have also had the'
chance to trek down to sunny
Cornwall to play football, hockey
and now even squash as part of the
weekend of competition.
To begin at the beginning -

memorable Camborne Weekend.

leave without Jason Brewer, who
was at the time climbing into a car
full of Sharons and Traceys from
Essex. Fortunately there was not
enough room for him in the Ford
Capri and he did make it down to
Camborne to do his bit for his
college. The excruciatingly tedious
journey to Cornwall was
enlightened only by some more
intracoach rugby and a lovely view
of some footballing bottoms in the
supporter's coach as they passed us
on the motorway.

sights; the plush luxury hotel we

still visible in some of the more
obscure parts of college? How
many of you know what the 'Bottle
Match' actually is? For the
uninitiated, the 'bottle', as it is
imaginatively known, is a bottle
which was displayed in our Union
Bar until a few weeks ago. It is the
trophy for the second oldest varsity
match alive in this country and to
gain this bottle the RSM and C S M
men's Rugby 15 have to go through
a gruelling 90 minutes on the pitch.
This match is almost as important
as the England versus Australia
final of last year's Rugby World
Cup - for some it is even more so.
The organisation! IC students late
again! Such tradition! We began at
the beginning - 11.00am Friday
21st February - but who cares. We
finally got away.

at the Newport Pagnall service
station, remembering how to chuck
and catch the rugby ball, while the
supporters and football bus
performed the far more important
function of filling up with vittels for
the six-and-a-half hour journey
ahead. Well fed and watered we

probably illegal) and attempted to

room. The Ladies Hockey team, the
Football team and the supporters
were dumped off in the cheapest
looking and smelliest hotel in the
town, which did have a lovely view
of one of Newquay's many bays as
a consolation. Oh lucky us! The
rugby team and the Men's Hockey
team headed off to a much quieter
petite bijoux residence-ette and a
good night's rest. After all theirs
was the important game.
