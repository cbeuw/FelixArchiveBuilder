Feature Felix 931 18 March 1992
Somewhere, buried deep inside
that part of the subconscious visited
only by exceptionally nosy
psychiatrists, must lie our basic
need to panic. Over just the last few
decades, we have worried our
collective way, from the Red
Menace and Nuclear holocausts,
through to chronic overpopulation
and AIDS. It seems that people
have always needed that 'little
something' to keep them awake at
night.
What all these paranoias shared
was a basis in truth surrounded by
a mass of myth and speculation.
The same is true of the current
favourite: the nineties nightmare of
catastrophic global warming. We
are told that, if mankind does not
cut back on the use of fossil fuels,
records show changes in conditions
from year to year and we all know
that the weather can change
suddenly, from clear and dry, to
cloudy and wet in a matter of
minutes. All these changes, on all
these different timescales, are (for
want of a better word) completely
'natural'. The atmosphere is nearly,
if not totally, chaotic.
If mankind is changing the
climate, the effects will not be easy
to see amid all the background
noise. There will definitely be no
steady increase in temperature.
There will be no simple obvious
signs. We do not even know exactly
what to look for or even if we have
seen it already.
That last point is especially
important. Whatever you may hear

the consequences could be
catastrophic, not just for us, but for
much of the life on this planet.
This is an extreme view, based as
much on imagination as
investigation, but at its heart lie hard
facts and carefully thought out
scientific theories: the trick is
finding them.
Global warming is, according to
the most simplistic theories, a
wholly man-made problem: we
burn fossil fuels and the
temperature rises - simple cause and
effect. This is, not to put so fine a
point on it, ill-informed
'ecobabble'.
The climate, or 'average'
weather, of this planet has never
been fixed. Geological records
show that the Earth has undergone
huge changes in surface
temperature with a whole series of
ice ages, each tens of thousands of
years long, separated by warmer
periods like the present day. The
century, or so, of man-made
from some quarters, there is little
evidence that we have witnessed the
first signs of climate change.
Certainly, the theory that the Great
Storm which hit Britain in October
1988 was a direct result of
increasing temperatures, an idea
reinforced by a recent Government-
inspired advertising campaign, is
very much a matter of dispute. It
would be equally valid to say that
a warmer world would lead to
fewer such storms, not more.
It gets worse. If we accept that
global warming is a reality, and we
do see a large increase in the global
average temperature, we have no
real idea of what this will bring. We
know that if the global average
temperature increases, the polar ice
caps will begin to melt and sea
levels will rise. We know that a
change in the distribution of rain
will affect the distribution of plant
growth. What we do not know is
how drastic these changes will be.
At one extreme, there are those
who believe that any change will be
gradual and that mankind will be
able to cope. At the other, there are
those who look at the carefully
balanced ecosystems of the tropical
rainforests and the masses of ice at
the edge of the Antarctic and predict
mass extinctions and an inundation
of 'biblical' proportions.
We do not yet fully understand
the way the atmosphere and oceans
behave. Until we do, it would be
wise to treat any predictions of
climate change with a certain
amount of scepticism; equally it
would be a serious mistake to say
that human activity is NOT leading
to global warming.
It should be remembered that,
supporting all the predictions from
the most conservative to the frankly
ridiculous, there is a perfectly valid
and coherent theory. There is some
evidence to back it up and, ignoring
all the arguments over the details,
it is remarkably straight forward.

If mankind is causing global
warming this must be due to an
enhanced 'greenhouse effect'. The
key word there is 'enhanced': the
greenhouse effect is neither a new
theory nor a controversial one. It is
the greenhouse effect that keeps the
surface of this planet warm enough
to live on.
Like any complicated machine,
the Earth requires a constant supply
of energy and the source for almost
all this energy is the high frequency,
short wavelength, radiation from
the Sun. Yet back of the envelope
calculations, equating the energy
supplied by the Sun with the energy
which must be radiated away by the
Earth simply by virtue of its surface
temperature, suggest that this
temperature should be around
minus 20 degrees Celsius.
The factor that is missing from
the back of the envelope, and which
makes the planet habitable, is the
action of the atmosphere.
All bodies must radiate energy.
In the vacuum of space, this energy
can only be in the form of
electromagnetic waves: waves with
characteristic frequencies and
wavelengths. Physical theory says
that this frequency must be related
to the surface temperature of the
body: a warmer body will emit
radiation of higher frequency and
shorter wavelength. The radiation
reaching the warm Earth from the
much hotter Sun will be of shorter
wavelength than that emitted from
the planet itself.
All gases can absorb radiated
energy but will not absorb all
frequencies of radiation. In
particular, certain gases in the
Earth's atmosphere, the so-called
'greenhouse gases', are largely
