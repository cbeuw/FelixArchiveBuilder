Goin' Local CrackWalker
The intrepid track through a
subterranean concrete nightmare to
reach the Theatre Royal Stratford
East (do not travel alone) is apt
preparation for the squalor and
sadness eloquently examined in
Trudi Iholi's new play Goin' Local.
Through an incessant stream of
black humour, the futility and
pathos of the character's situation
is adroitly displayed. A cast of 14
engage in some flawless acting
complementing a detailed and well-
written script. The majority of the
... inaction occurs in the decaying
office of an east-end-minicab firm
'Can-do-Cars'. The pathetic
telephone controllers, Nora, a
stunning performance from Kate
(Company, Only Fools and Horses,
Smith and Jones) Williams, works
an eighteen hour day, 'for life's
little luxuries' and presides over the
drivers. Her motley crew comprises
of ex-convicts, tranquiliser addicts,
pot-smokers, alcoholics and at the
helm, their boss, the white-socked,
portable phoned, east-end wide-
boy, Lol (Glyn Grimstead).
Customers come in all shapes and
sizes, most notably the menacing
cold-flashing crook Boy Boy (Louis
Hellis). A bouyant script and
impeccable performances manage
to distract from the lack of plot until
the unlikely, unfunny ending. This,
however, fails to mar an enjoyable,
thought-provoking evening worth
attending for the throw-away one
liners delivered with verve and
panache by an accomplished
company.

• Theatre Royal Stratford East,
Gerry Raffles Square, Stratford
East E15. 081-534 0310. Stratford
tube/BR. Monday-Saturday, 8pm,
£3-£12, £2 cones (ends April 4).
The Gate Theatre goes Beyond
Europe this season. The first in this
series of contemporary plays from
quite a long way away is the
Canadian Crack-walker by Judith
Thompson, to be followed by a
Nigerian and Argentinian play in
April and May.
Crackwalker takes a look at the
lifestyles of the urban underclass of
Kingstown. Therese lives on
doughnuts and doesn't like to be
called a retard, so her friends avoid
that phrase. Alan is her boyfriend,
and later, husband. He hears voices
in his head. Sandy and Joe are their
friends. They are 'normal'. Joe
beats up Sandy, who beats up Joe.
Then there is an Indian hanging
around, who is friends with no one.
He is always drunk or high and
hates all blacks and Indians.
There are some great scenes in
this, like when Alan proposes to
Therese (in a doughnut shop, where
else?). He had never known a girl
like her, always laughing...'But
sometimes I cry'.—'Yes, but you
cry just like you laugh.'
The acting was quite good,
although I thought Sandy was a bit
too stylish and actors are always
lazy with accents. (You can't
exaggerate an American accent.)
Still, Kathy Burke as Therese
alone would make the show
worthwhile. Also the way they
make us of their little room is
amazing.

• Crackwalker will run until
April 4 at Gates Theatre, 11

**Coming S o o n * *
Due to the Easter break looming,
and no Felix for ages -1 thought I'd
cheer up your revision blues by
commenting on the plethora of films
- either too late to be in this issue
or on general release over Easter.
Top of the 'let me see' list is
probably 'Bugsy', just missing this
issue, opening in the West End on
20th March. With such a strong
cast, led by Warren Beatty - this
film should have no problem pulling
in the crowds - it's meant to be
pretty hot stuff too, well the Gerbil
didn't slag it off anyway.
Shining through, starring Melanie
Griffith and Michael Douglas,
chronicles the daring adventure of
a Brooklyn born secretary, who
puts her life on the line for her
country etc,etc, all set against the
sweeping tapestry of the second
world war. Opens on the 20th
March.
Provisionally set for release on
27th March is the long awaited
'Freejack', a rivetting sci-fi thriller
so I'm told, which tells the story of
a young race car driver who
miraculously escapes death in a
crash, only to awaken in the year
2009 running for his life. Starring
Emilio Estevez, Anthony Hopkins
and, would you believe, Mick
Jagger!
Also on the 'meant to be good'
list is 'Deceived' starring Goldie
Hawn - and it's not a pseudo
comedy! A psychological thriller
with.deceiving aplenty - probably.
Opens in the first week of April.
Other Big name movies hitting
these shores soon are 'Rush', who's
actors names escape me, 'My Own
Private Idaho' -Keanu Reeves,
'Medicine Man' -Sean Connery,
and of course 'Biggies' like 'Cape
Fear' and 'Hook' and the excellent
'The Doctor' Well I think that's
most of them, there are a couple
more which the Big Bronze Bap
says to avoid, nevertheless there
should be enough here to keep you
happy. Have a great Easter, forget
revision for one night and take an
old friend out to see a film. See you
in the Summer. Oh before I go, I
must give a thousand thanks to
Catherine and Boris for their
priceless help this term -
Thankyou.
