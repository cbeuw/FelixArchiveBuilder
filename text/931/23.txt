Eats a Bunny Candyland: God
For those of you staying in
London over the break, here's a box
to keep you amused while you
haven't got any lectures to go to.
For those of you not staying in
London, may I suggest a visit to
Norwich in the last week of the
break to see Carter. You might be
able to see them in London as well,
but I don't know where. Or maybe
I do. but I'm not telling you,
nonetheless.
Right, from the top... Boo
Hewerdine, acoustic guitar, not
much else, and Because, ex of
Furniture. Brilliant, mind. Trash =
Jesus Jones, Jacob's Mouse, current
music press darlings.
The Jazz and Rock club night
should feature about eightish
college bands in the union concert
hall. Admission, and other such
trivial details are unknown to me,
but I do know that The Pheasant
Pluckers and Blue Salamander will
be amongst them. Failing that, out
in the big wide world live Mega
City 4.
On the 24 (sold out) and 25
March, Shakespear's Sister deny
the fact that they're 50% Banana,
and bring some Candyland along
too. There's already far too much
of them in this issue, so no more.
Equally, on the 25th, Scorpio
Rising try to organise a gig that ents
can't schedule anything against.
This time they're being attacked by
Shakespear's Sister. Not your
month, is it, lads?
Next up, it's Ride, Going Blank
at the Academy, where Creation
appear to have taken up residence
for the week, with the well sold out
Primal Scream the next day. If
you haven't got a ticket, may I
suggest you go to the Marquee, and
laugh at Mark Shaw, previously of
Then Jerico, getting blown off stage
by his support, My Life Story.
Out There, in April, Claytown
Troupe plug their new album, and
then The Frank And Walters play
at the Fulham Gardens which used
to be the Hibernian or vice versa,
the whereabouts of which no-one
seems to know. Don't ask London
Transport, they don't know.
Back at the Academy, now that
Creation have moved out, leaving
behind only the recently departed
My Bloody Valentine, along with
Jesus and Mary Chain, Dinosaur
Jr., and some other lightweights.
Nothing happens for two weeks
then. Why don't you go and see
your parents? I'm sure they'd love
to see you. That's what someone
said to me. When you've seen
them, scrounged some cash, been
fed, and restocked with heaps of
food, wander back, maybe to the
Marquee for Rosetta Stone, goths,
or EMF, with some special guests,
at the Unexplainably small
Underworld. Maybe even do some
revis-

5.30: The appointed time for,the.'
interview. Pat and I are in the
Borderline. Candyland are not.
Candyland are in two separated
vans, both lost in the one way
system of the West End.
6.15: Two-fifths of Candyland
are here. The rest of them are not.
6.30: The appointed time for the
soundcheck. Candyland are
struggling down the stairs into the
Borderline, with huge flightcases of
equipment. Somehow or other, it
has transpired that Pat and I are also
carrying cases.
6.45: Candyland are attempting
to put all their equipment on stage.
Considering that their equipment
takes up an area the size of Hyde
Park, and the stage is the size, of the
traffic island on Prince Consort
Road, this is a major task. Felix
Tod, the singer/songwriter walks
past me, and says 'God says no to
fast food.' The significance of this
remark escapes me.
8.00: Soundcheck over.
Candyland are being fed. The
support band are soundchecking
now. This means that their food has
been left unattended on the table. A
bad idea. Felix is eating a tortilla
from one of the support band's
enchiladas, and rearranging the
vegetables to cover up his misdeed.
David Wesley Ayers, guitarist, is
cutting the middle out of a burger,
and replacing the bun on top. 2 'A
hours late, we start...
How, when, why did it all start?
David: A few years ago, I came
over from the States, and wanted to
form a band, and I found Felix on
the steps of a mosque. I tell right
away that he was an absolute nutter,
but he had really good lyrics, he had
these scribblings, about forty pieces
of paper falling out of his pockets,
really good stuff.
Felix: We come from all over the
world, Diid from Somalia, M C
from Jamaica, Colin from
Southend, and me from Scotland.
I was a fireman, and I came down
to London on the day of Live Aid.
And then the other members of the
band came along. Colin used to
work in The City, and all the mone
he managed to swindle from The
City bought all our early
equipment.
Cowboy Junkies
- Albert Hall
Although any song that contains the
lyrics 'Your body for my soul, fair
swap 'cause cheap is how I feel',
can't be anything other than intense.
The highlights of the opening set
were the sassy Townes Blues.
displaying the early blues
influences, and the rejoiner
Cowboy Junkies Lament; written
by Townes Van Zandt. And then it
was over, or so it seemed. After one
hour of pain, rejection and despair,
Margo was saying 'Well it's been
really cool...'. But then they
returned for another % of an hour
and two encores. Included, this time
were the much requested Misguided
Angel with its almost disastrous
ending and the most ambitious
cover of all time—The Velvet's
Sweet Jane. This time re-covered in
the original Lou Reed disjointed
style. Then they were gone. Margo
wrapped herself in a shawl, waved
and wandered off after the rest of
the band. Who needs volume
anyway?
Jon Jordan.
From the balcony in the Albert
Hall, we could just about see the
waif-like figure that was Margo
Timms, the Junkie's vocalist. But
when the band picked up, there was
no doubt who was controlling the
show. A voice like that is more than
spine chilling, becoming ghostly in
its power to transfix. Equally eerie
was the subject matter of the songs.
Whilst always ethereal, there was
also a hint of reality that let you
know the Junkies had been there
themselves. No Rhinestone allowed
here.
The set was interspersed by
stories about touring, playing dice,
dedications to family; even one for
the balcony 'Thank you for coming
tonight, we didn't think we'd fill it'.
To choose 'Cause Cheap is how J
feel was slightly mocking though.
