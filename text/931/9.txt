staff at the Royal School of Mines,
he also talked them into helping him
load a van with the stolen
equipment. He was only caught
when he returned the following day
and was recognised by Deputy
Security Chief, Terry Briley. The
reason the man was recognised was
because he was sacked from the
School last October for a similar
operation.
The security epidemic is in
danger of making Felix look like a
Metropolitan Police charge sheet.
On January 17, over 20 thefts since
the start of the year had been
reported. Stolen items included
wallets, cash, cheque books, two
fax machines, a stereo hi-fi system,
compact disc player, miniature
television, mountain bike, his and
her towel set, 24 piece dinner set,
cuddly toy. The bike thefts
prompted a visit from Inspector
Knacker of the Yard, in the forms
of PCs Colman and Law, who
security coded cycles in the
Sherfield building.
The Union building fared no
better. £10,000 worth of trophies
were stolen during the first week,
and IC Radio reported the Union
President, Zoe Hellinger, as
implying an inside job. Inside Beit
Arch, the new ritual of card
checking was enacted, giving
money to duty officers, causing
disorientation among the non-sober
and supposedly making us all safer.
Another theft of sorts was the
removal of 3,500 Felices during the
morning of 31 January. The
'Neighbourhood Watch' award this
term goes to IC DramSoc, for their
careful policing of what was written
about them. Assisting the
distribution of a two page glory
spread about them, and then
thieving a not-so complementary
review, their policing tended to be
a tad Stalinist, and according to the
Independent newspaper, Stalinism

is the favourite sport of IC
President, Zoe Hellinger. Zoe gets
this term's 'Catch Me If You Can'
award. After the removal (sic) of
the Fallacies, she told IC Radio that
she knew nothing. She added,
'there are a lot of words going
round that it is Grease, it may have
been anyone else, there were
several other articles in Felix that
could have surmised that they were
annoying people.'
That was Friday. By the
following Tuesday, Zoe had called
a press conference to announce ' I
admit to taking several piles of
Paddy Ashdown, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, who spoke at a
' Youth and Student Day' at Westminster Central Hall in February
Firemen were called in connection
building in February
Felices on Friday the 31st of
January'. Not one for modesty, she
added, 'it was a stupid thing to do,
but it can't be undone and I'm sorry
it happened'. She then challenged
anyone who thought her actions
would affect her position as Union
President to table a motion of no
confidence at the E G M scheduled
for two days hence. Knowing full
well that no-one knew the full facts
of the case, this gauntlet throwing
represented Zoe's craftiest move of
the year. Surprising no
expectations, she was still in her
post by Thursday night, talking of
her emotional tie ups, and
expressing the wish that the affair
was now over.
Talking of affairs, the Virgin
'Who's Been Sleeping With Who In
they could take
a sledgehammer
to it
Sherfield/Prince's Gardens' has had
to be dropped this term, due to the
change of ownership of the
sponsoring company. This is a pity,
as we had a really nice couple this
term, and they weren't students.
People who won't be students
next year, but who will still be
with a flood in the Chemistry
about are our new sabbaticals, for
whom the £5k plus accommodation
is enough reward, thank you. And
what a dismal campaign it was. It
started off by giving the impression
of being quickly cobbled together,
and the candidates really did
nothing to dispel this over the
course of the fortnight. Despite
strong hustings performances from
Chris Davidson and Jonty Beavan,
it's a bit sad that the only campaign
that had been firmly mooted well in
advance was that of Toby Jones.
Another dismal aspect was the
stupid election rules which still now
prevent me from telling you how
badly the Hon. Sec. candidates
performed when they were
interviewed on IC Radio. Suffice to
say that one dried up and was told
to go away and think things out, and
the other boxed himself into his own
suggestion box.
Thankfully we had New Election,
which was the real surprise of the
election. Not, I hasten to add
because it won, but because of its
competent performance under the
direction of Returning Officer.
Steve Farrant, who is the recipient
of the 'Home Improvement' award.
On the 18th January, Steve ordered
the destruction of a union antique.
The offending object was
apparently not Jonathan Griffiths,
but was a disused piano. Mr.
Farrant said that he found some
people 'hitting' the piano, and he
told them that they could 'take a
sledgehammer to it'. This he
described as a 'throwaway
comment'; eight out of ten cat
