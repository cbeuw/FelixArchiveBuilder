18 March 1992 Felix 931 Music
American country Soundgarden.
9Soundgarden play a short U K
tour to coincide with the release of
'Jesus Christ Pose' on March 30,
on A & M .
The Cure
- High
There is absolutely no doubt that
this will be a hit, simply because
The Cure are massively popular,
and all the people who were going
to buy it have already done so.
They're also liked by the BPI,
winning best British group in a year
when they didn't actually release
any new material. But why? Most
of their material sounds exactly the
same, which may have been
different for a while, but this is no
improvement on any of the songs
Soundgarden
- Jesus Christ
Pose
Soup Dragons
- Divine Thing
Manic Street
Preachers
- Slash 'n'
Burn
Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear. This has
really done it. The next issue of
F;
elix will be flooded with letters
from religious types, and it's all my
fault. What's more, none of them
will have even heard the song. The
lyrics are actually more or less
immaterial, as they can't actually be
heard above the solid wall of noise
emerging from the speakers. And
a most agreeable solid wall of noise
it is too.
12" and C D formats carry a
Black Sabbath cover, 'Into The
Void', which had its lyrics changed
due to a protest letter from a Red
Indian. Somehow I think
Soundgarden are trying to follow
this precedent. Provocative gits.
Nothing but trouble.

on 'Disintegration', three years
ago. Both sides. Exactly the same.
Face it, this band have survived for
so long, on nothing new, and have
only released a handful of good
songs in the past ten years or so -
'In Between Days', 'Close To Me',
and a couple of others. If any other
band took as long as this to develop
they would have been duly slated
long ago. How do The Cure get
away with it? Who have they been
sleeping with?

• 'High' is out now on
Fiction/Polydor. The album 'Wish'
is out at the end of April, when The
Cure tour.
Oh, what a heavenly thing this is.
The cover is a weird and wacky
montage that probably has some
deep and thoroughly philosophical
meaning, but its all lost on me.
Deep is one word you most
definitely could not call the record
though. It makes you want to
bounce up and down, do an
impression of Timmy Mallet on a
controlled substance, and generally
feel happy. They may counter this
and suggest that I have missed the
boat, but who gives a shit. I like it
and will probably be the second
record I play the next time I'm
feeling depressed. (The first being
'Smile' by Levitation.)

• 'Divine Thing' is released on
March 30 on Raw TV/Big Life.
Sultans of
- IC Union
Firstly, I'd like to congratulate BJ
on his thorough checking of stamps
at the Sultans Of Ping FC gig,
extended even to turning away
Shane McGowan of the Pogues,
until he too had one.
Support provided by the ever
lovely Herb, tonight sporting a new
bassist and a few new songs. Herb
are indie pop. Herb are funny, I've
told you all this before.
The Sultans Of Ping FC appeared
One of the better tracks from the
'Generation Terrorists' album with
some wicked lyrics. 'Kill to live,
kill for kicks', oh what naughty
boys. Backed by 'Motown Junk',
which if I recall was an early single
that crashed'n'burned, and 'Ain't
Goin' Down', perhaps the slowest
track they have ever released and
definitely the most suspect number
on the ep. Too quiet by half and I
do wish they would learn to spell.
What more do you want, blood?
Well there's some of that on the
front and back covers. Happy?

• 'Slash 'n' Burn' and the album
'Generation Terrorists' are
available now. on Columbia.
Ping FC
to be labouring under the illusion
that they were at an art college. This
would be enough to earn them a bad
review. Still, who cares? The sight
of Irishmen dressed up in drag,
pretending to be The Clash or The
Jam, singing about Ken Barlow,
and that of at least some of the
crowd lying down on their backs
and kicking, in the true Sultans'
tradition. The stagediving was what
pushed me over the edge then.
Feeling that, logically, I must be
under the influence of some strange
and previously undiscovered
hallucinogen, I left.
