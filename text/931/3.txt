Badly Tackled Up,up and Away
After a case of alleged indecent
exposure during the Imperial
College Rugby Football Club
(ICRFC) dinner last Wednesday.
Ian Richards, the Snack Bar
Manager has lodged an official
complaint to the Union Disciplinary
Committee.
The complaint concerns the
alleged verbal and sexual abuse of
temporary staff hired by the Union
by members of the ICRFC. As a
result of the behaviour, the kitchens
in the Union were closed early and
staff left with out clearing up after
the dinner in protest.
Andrew Montgomery, ICRFC
Captain, admitted there had been a
case of indecent exposure but said
that it took place during speeches
when serving staff should not have
been in the room. He said that the
comments were 'good humoured
and well intentioned' and that these
were 'pissed idiots ideas of a
compliment.' M r Montgomery
added that he was surprised that the
staff took such offence and that
accusations of sexual assault were
false.
Mr Montgomery claimed that
many inaccurate accusations had
been levelled at the Rugby Club this
year. He continued by saying that
Zoe Hellinger, ICU President, had
told him she wished to make an
example of the Rugby Club and
stamp out sexism once and for all
at Imperial.
Ms Hellinger later confirmed that
she would take proceedings 'all the
way' at the disciplinary committee
to be held next term. She added that
it was 'unacceptable' that
supposedly intelligent men treated
the Union as a 'spit and sawdust
joint.'
As no one has been identified in
connection with the incidents, the
Union has decided to take each
individual present at the Rugby
Club Dinner through the
disciplinary process. Anyone who
is found guilty by the disciplinary
committee could face a fine or ban
from Imperial College Union.
Sports Refit
Imperial College Union has been
asked to pay £650,000 towards the
redevelopment of the Sports Centre
by Imperial College.
Imperial College management
wish to take the money out of the
Harlington Trust. This is £ 2 . 7
million produced by the selling of
gravel found under the College
sports ground at Harlington. The
Car Parking
College management want to take
money from the Trust as an interest
free loan and ICU is rumoured to
find this option unacceptable.
Sources in the Union say that they
wish to lend the money to College
at standard Bank base rates or have
a controlling stake in the way the
Sports Centre is run.
Director of Estates. Mr Gordon
Marshall, said yesterday that
proposals for the future of the
College car park would soon be
finalised. Speaking to iCNN, Mr
Marshall said 'we are still working
on it. and I hope we will know
where we are going fairly soon.'
The future of the College car park
first came into question with the
opening of negotiations on the
future of the Messenger, Security
and Car Parking services last
November. Following the day of
action on December 4th. the
Rector, Sir Eric Ash, asked unions
to consider the car park's future as
separate from that of the Messenger
and Security services.
With the signing of the contract
awarding the Messenger and
Security services in house now
imminent, attention has turned to
the car park. Fears had been
expressed that College management
had already decided to privatise the
car park, and that tenders had been
advertised for and accepted while
the messenger and security
negotiations were continuing.
The delay in reaching a decision
has been due to management
'considering the legality' of the
proposals on the table, according to
Mr Marshall. This is taken as
referring to problems with
corporation tax. Late last year,
college unions accused Mr Marshall
of misleading negotiators on
whether corporation tax was due if
the car park were kept as part of the
security service. Unions regarded
Mr.Marshall's stance then as an
' attempt to force privatisation of the
entire service. Questions were also
asked about the car park profit
figures put forward by M r
Marshall. Sources claimed that his
figures were inaccurate to the tune
of £75.000.
Changes in the rents in Imperial
College Halls will be announced on
April 30th. in the first week of the
summer term.
It is believed that the rent
increases will be kept to the rate of
inflation. Mr Angus Fraser, IC
Managing Director, is reported to
consider inflation to be around 5%.
Jonathan Griffiths, IC Union
Deputy President, is at present
conducting negotiations with the
Estates Division of college. He told
iCNN that no increase in rent would
be acceptable this year.
Princess Anne, Chancellor of the University of London, visited Imperial
College on Tuesday 10th March, to open the a new Interdisciplinary
Research Centre (IRC) in the Chemical Engineering Department. The
Centre for Process Systems Engineering has been functioning since August
1989 and is deemed to be the biggest IRC so far.
Sports Refund
It has been rumoured this week that
college staff will receive a refund
of up to £ 1 0 on their yearly sports
centre membership fees.
Ms Caroline Osner. IC Sports
and Leisure Manager, is believed to
have said that a refund may be given
to all IC staff, reducing membership
costs to £24. This compares to the
annual student fee of £18, but it was
rumoured that student money would
not be refunded because "it would
be too difficult to administer.'
Ms Osner has been on holiday
this week and therefore unavailable
to comment on the rumours, as has
Mr Rob Coleman, Sports Centre
Manager. Ms Val Straw, IC
Facilities Manager, and Director of
Estates, Mr Gordon Marshall, were
also both unavailable for comment.
Room with a Queue
After last minute negotiations the
number of rooms provided for
storage in Southside Halls over
Easter has been increased. Due to
large block bookings for
conferences many people will have
to move from their rooms over
Easter. This has provided an
increase in the amount of storage
required, but until the beginning of
the week only 14 rooms had been
provided. This is a reduction from
the usual number of 16 rooms.
Miss Nicky Fox, ICU Housing
officer, is believed to have
renegotiated the position so the full
16 rooms could be used. At present
10 rooms in Linstead and 3 in
Weeks Hall are to be used for
storage.
