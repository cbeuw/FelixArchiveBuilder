Letters Felix 931 18 March 1992
Politically Correct Corruption
r-» A A N M _ ..
Dear Adam.
This letter is essentially one of
apology; both to a specific
individual, and to anyone offended
by the last issue of Broadsheet. In
that issue, the word, 'niggerbasher'
was printed in an article, in relation
to the aforementioned individual.
The use of the word was an 'in-
joke' related to an entirely innocent
incident that occurred on an RCS
Rag Tour two years ago.
Regrettably, to anyone who is not
familiar with the joke (i.e.
practically everyone), it would
seem that the person was being
glorified for his prowess in beating
up racial minorities. This has
already resulted in a threat of
violence towards him. averted only
by careful explanation. I would like
to apologise to him for this and any
unjustified damage to his reputation
this may have caused. I also
apologise to anyone who was quite
rightly offended or disturbed by
what they considered a racist
comment in print.
Upon reading the last issue of
Felix, I was greeted with a cartoon
that depicted me as a drunk, racist
yob. This was quite interesting
coming from someone who doesn't
even know me personally. I may be
a generally unpleasant person, but
I am none of these things (not to my
knowledge, anyway). However, the
artist was entirely within their rights
to criticise, and apart from the
libellous nature of it, the cartoon
contained valid points. When I
edited the article in question, I
failed to remove the offending
word. Perhaps a more competent
editor would not have overlooked
this.
On the whole, I would rather be
incompetent than racist.
Yours.
David Coddard,
Broadsheet Editor 91-92.
P.S. Although this letter is
actually a sincere apology, I
imagine that there are a number of
zealots who will not be happy unless
I am thrown out of college for some
perceived lack of Political
Correctness.
Dodgy Videos
Dear Adam,
This is only a short letter but I
feel I must follow up on Jon
Jordan's letter in Felix 929. Whilst
I agree that '...such thinking can
never solve man's problems', my
aim is not to discuss the (in)validity
of the good concept but to put him
right on his last comment on
Humanism. Humanists most
definitely do not lack moral values.
Religions do not have a monopoly
on morals. Morals from religion are
often, at best, riddled with
inconsistencies and could even be
called perverted in some cases.
Would anyone here agree that it is
moral to sentence an author to death
for exercising his right to free
speech?
What humanists seek is to base
their morals on rational grounds as
opposed to the interpretation of
'Holy Scriptures'.
As regards '...dodgy videos',
well, to each his own I suppose.
Certainly selling such videos is not
a tenet of Humanism.

Bailey on the Fox
Dear Adam,
It is some time since I have
written to you, but I felt I must write
on the issue of fox hunting. Before
and since Kevin McNamara's bill
was thrown out in parliament, a hell
of a lot of nonsense has been written
and spoken on this subject. Being
a landowner the only foxes I know
are those that rip open black rubbish
bags that inefficient councils
dustman leave behind.
Foxes are vermin. No better than
rats. I sometimes fell that I couldn't
give a toss whether they are ripped
apart by dogs, killed humanely or
gunned down by the SAS provided
that they do kill them. If they took
a few domestic dogs with them who
crap all over the pavement, all the
better. However I wonder how
many of these people would
criticise fox hunting if it was the
past time of ethnic minorities and
not a British tradition. They'd
probably be the very same people
who'd attack critics for being racist!
I must admit that I do find killing
animals solely for sport distasteful.
I wonder what goes through the
minds of these silly people in stupid
red coats. There toffs gather
together, have a couple of sherries
and have a 'jolly' good time. I bet
you would find a large number of
them wearing the same school tie!
However you can 'understand' why
they do this. This lot are just
emulating the example given to
them by the Royal family. You see
the Duke of Edinburgh and all the
Dear Adam,
I am writing this letter to
elucidate upon the corruption of the
re-app selection system in some
halls of residence, as it is about that
time of year again, and I would like
the Wardens not to be led again this
year as they have in previous years.
The point is that the re-apps are
selected by a committee of wardens
and subwardens with the advice of
the current re-apps. There in, lies
the problem, since it is usually the
current re-apps 'best friends' who
are picked.
O K these people may be
'popular', but the point is that there

other hangers on, go%out shooting
wild stag and pheasants.
If they want to chase and kill
thick, second rate forms of life, why
don't they start with Di and her free
loading sisters in law, Fergie.
Lets not hear all this cant and
nonsense about fox hunting keeping
down the number of foxes. It does
nothing to control numbers. In fact
the Isle of Wight did not have a fox
problem until foxes were introduced
for the sole purpose of hunting.
Why don't they just admit they love
chasing things and killing them?
Why don't they just tell the
antihunting lobby to sod off?
I'm often criticised for being too
inflexible but I have come up with
a solution to this problem. Under
my system fox hunting would be
have been candidates in the past,
that were just friends with the re-
apps and no one else. They were
also very irresponsible, having had
several warnings from the wardens
over the year. But these people
were chosen and became re-apps
because they were 'popular' as far
as the re-apps were concerned.
Popular people are not always the
best people for the job. All I ask is
that this year the wardens look
through the cliquey 'friends' system
that is currently in operation, and
good luck this year if you have
applied.

PS Who was that total moron who
wrote that crap about the IC football
team? If this cretin actually went
and watched the teams play they'd
see how much dedication and effort
is put into playing. Who knows,
Felix might even then support
something the students do!
