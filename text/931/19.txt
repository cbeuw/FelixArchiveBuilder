The Doctor
William Hurt (Children of a Lesser
God, Broadcast News) is Jack
MacKee, a successful member of a
thriving practice, who has a very
nice life, plenty of money, nice car,
beautiful wife and kid, a luxurious
home and all the opulent trappings
of prosperity. The only thing
missing is true compassion for the
patients in his care. But Jack sees
things from a very different light
when he is diagnosed as having
cancer of the Larynx.
As the difference between merely
treating a patient and caring for
them become clear to Jack, he
meets a young woman named June
(Elizabeth Perkins—Big, He Said,
She Said)—a patient he meets while
attending radiotherapy, whose
uncommon strength and spirit
becomes the catalyst for his own
recovery and the understanding that
a healer must first know about heart
before operating on one.
The film is based on the book 'A
taste of my own medicine' by Dr
Ed Rosenbaum, a successful
physician who was diagnosed as
having cancer.
It is a very moving film,
heartwarming to see an ignorant
man going through such change,
and touching that someone like
June—whose brain tumour was
found too late to save her, someone
in a worse position, can have so
much more strength and
understanding, and many more of
the qualities that make us human.
There are even those moments of
inane humour, like the singing of
'Big Girls Don't Cry' around the
operating table, or when Dr
MacKee, instead of taking his
students round the wards, gets them
to put on gowns and be patients
prescribed illnesses for seventy odd
hours!
The Doctor doesn't open in the
West End until the first week in
april, but I'm told you can send
away for tickets in the Radio Times.
Try not to miss this film, it may be
a tearjerker, and if you are not
compassionate you will hate it, but
it does strike some truths, which
hopefully it won't take us all
situations like this to realise.
POO
Fried Green Tomatoes Cabal and Love
Wandering around the underground
you'd be forgiven for thinking this
film was going to be a monster hit,
(what with posters that size), it
isn't, but it certainly isn't poo
either, a bit of a weird one this.
What we are getting for our
money is really a story within a
story. In the present day Evelyn
Couch (Kathy Bates), an
overweight woman in her early
forties is in a rut. Her husband's
aunt, bedridden in a nursing home,
throws blunt objects at her. Her
only friend is a newly met resident
of the nursing home, feisty
octogenarian, Ninny Threadgoode
(Jessica Tandy), who enthrals
Evelyn with tales from her home of
Whistle Stop, Alabama. This is
where the story within a story bit
comes in: Fifty years back, Ninny
recalls, Idgie Threadgoode (Mary
Stuart Masterson) ran the Whistle
Stop cafe (fried green tomatoes a
speciality). The story is quite long,
starting with Idgie's troubled
childhood, moving through her
finding a much needed friend in the
form of Ruth (Mary Louise Parker),
a demure, good-hearted young
woman who suffers one tragedy
after another.
These stories - which Ninny
relates to Evelyn in her visits the
nursing home - provoke Evelyn -
she starts taking control of her life
with often amusing consequences.
Like the best of tales, 'Fried
Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop
Cafe' connects with experiences we
all share; wedding and funerals,
recreation and retribution, morals,
memorable meals and of course, the
occasional murder. The main thing
I hold against this film is that it's
a tad too long, but where it succeeds
is in the lack of bittiness evident in
'multiple' story films, and its wry
sense of humour. It's another one
of those not for the non-
compassionates I'm afraid, but it is
extremely well put together, oh, the
music is ace.
POO
Having sat down in the audience,
you're thrown back in time: 1784,
a principality in Germany.
It takes time to get used to the
setting of the 18th century, but then
you get gripped by the intrigue of
satire, class-borders dividing
lovers, despotism and rebellion.
The conflict of lovers divided by
society, the questioning of the social
system and the doctrine of divine
rights combined with a
revolutionary spirit are typical
features of the 'Storm and Stress'
era, when young poets like Schiller
supported the 'new' ideas of
parliamentarism, human rights,
freedom of spirit and 'creating
genius'.
Theatre Manoevres provides you
with basic background info in their
programme. The company is
bravely promoting classical foreign
plays, which would otherwise not
be seen here. It is well done in the
case of Cabal and Love.
The situation in Schiller's time is
a far cry from our society today, so
it's difficult to identify with some
elements of the play—except for the
love story of course.
Cobal and Love, Lyric Studio,
10-28 March, Hammersmith, 8pm.
Tickets £6.30. Tel 081-741 2311.
