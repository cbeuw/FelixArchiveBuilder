Malaise Warwick Palatable
Sir Eric Ash, the Rector of
Imperial College, has been
suffering from Malaria since
returning from a trip to India three
weeks ago. He has received hospital
treatment but has been seen in
College this week and is believed
to be recovering.
The Bill
Queen Mary and Westfield College
Student Union may be charged
£14,000 by its College as payment
for the occupation of the College
buildings it organised in January.
The occupation was in protest
against a number of College
management policies and was
considered to be a success.
Although Cub, the newspaper of the
college, reported that this was a low
fine in comparison with other
unions who organised occupations,
members of the Union said that they
would be 'disgusted' if the fine went
ahead.
Mascotry
A report in the latest issue of Casey
L. of King's College London,
details the raids on the City and
Guilds Union and Mines Union
(RSMU) offices in which Spanner,
Bolt and Davy were kidnapped. The
report states that Davy will be
returned when Tim Cotton, RSMU
president, learns to lose
gracefully.' M r Cotton told Felix
that he was fed up with the whole
affair, which was, in his view, a
breach of a mascotry moriatorium
and which also resulted in the
demolition of the RSMU office
door.
Error
The Frank and Walters gig for April
3rd billed on page 24 has been
'relocated' from the advertised
venue. The new venue has not been
made known.
The Student Union elections rerun
at Warwick University, reported in
Felix last week, have produced
exactly the same results as three
weeks ago. The elections for sixteen
posts were annulled after the
Labour club overspent by £31.40 on
its campaign, (see Felix 929) and
speculation was rife that the post of
President might change hands. A
student at Warwick summed up the
whole affair as 'a complete waste
of time and money.'
In a separate development, the
Editor of the Warwick student
newspaper, The Warwick Boar,
faced a motion of censure over
claims that the coverage of the
election was biased.
The Deputy President Services of
Durham University's Student
Union, Mat Wrigley, has been
elected as next year's editor of their
student newspaper 'Palatinate.'
Surprise has been expressed that 'an
employee of the union who is no
longer a student' could be allowed
to stand, and there are reservations
that M r Wrigley could be
compromised in holding both
positions. The situation has arisen
because nobody else has stood for
the post, which is non-sabbatical.
This might mean that the 44 year
old paper would have to cease
publication for the first time since
its inception.(Palatinate, Durham
University)
New Elections
Nominations reopened on Monday
16th March for the post of
Honorary Secretary (Events) after
New Election won the post in the
sabbatical elections last week.
The papers will stay up across the
Easter Holidays until Friday 27th
March. Hustings will be held in the
Union Bar at 6.00pm on Thursday
30th April with voting on 5th and
6th May. At the time of writing
three candidates have put their
names up. They are Adrian
Edwards (Maths 2), Toby Jones
(Elec Eng 3), who was a candidate
for Felix Editor in the previous
elections and Dominic Wilkinson

Petition
A petition is circulating Evelyn
Gardens addressed to Gordon
Marshall and all the Heads of
Departments. It complains about the
poor state of the College halls, the
time taken to make repairs, and the
fact that a number of students had
been threatened with legal action for
non-payment of rent when it
actually had been paid.
This follows a similar petition in
Southside Halls which gathered 150
signatures.
Outrage
Students at Lillian Penson Hall
(LPH), a London University
intercollegiate hall of residence, are
in 'outrage' about the proposed
11 % increase in rent. This is a
higher increase than any other such
residence and follows cutbacks in
all its services. Claims of
'mismanagement' amongst L P H
administrators have led to demands
that an outside body should study
its accounts. (London Student,
University of London)
Oxford
Oxford University Students Union
have elected their new sabbaticals.
The sabbs were elected on a party
political basis, as are most National
Union of Students (NUS) affiliated
Student Union elections. After the
count had been announced, Vicki
Howe decided to take the
Presidency, Nigel Huddleston took
Welfare and Elliot Wallace took
Vice President (Finance). (Oxford
