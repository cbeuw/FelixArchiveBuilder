Last week's 'answers'
Dear Adam.
I would like to correct part of
Declan Curry's article. 'This Old
House' in last week Felix (929).
The inaccurancy concerns the
procedure for reporting defects in
Halls of Residence. I have discussed
this with both Gordon Marshall and
Graham Daniels, and the correct
sequence of events for a resident to
follow is:
-Report the defect to the
housekeeper who will inform the
Maintenance Group in the Sherfield
Building. The fault is logged on the
computer system and given an
incident number. The maintenance
group will then fix the defect.
-If after a few days however, the
fault has not been corrected, the
resident should go back to the
housekeeper to ensure that the fault
has been logged correctly. The
housekeeper will contact the
maintenance group again and
hopefully the defect will be dealt
with.
-If no action appears to have been
taken after a few more days, the
resident should contact either
Graham Daniels or Pat Miller, the
Residence Managers (ext 3553) and
they will find out what is causing
the delay and make sure that the
defect is corrected.
It is also important to let the
housekeepers know when the defect
has been fixed to avoid any
unnecessary work for them in
chasing up the maintenance group.
If any resident does not wish to
contact the Residence Managers
personally, they can put a note
detailing the problem in my
pigeonhole in the Union Office and
I will contact either Pat or Graham
on their behalf.
Nicky Fox,
Union Housing Officer.
It Never Rains
Dear Adam.
Yet again Felix has failed to
research its information properly.
1 am refering to the article by
Declan Curry in last week's Felix
which states the showers at
Clayponds leak. As a resident of
Clayponds I can assure you they do
not. not even one of them, and I
think it is an unfair slur on the
management to suggest it.

P.S. All the showers were
disconnected last Wednesday.
P.P.S. The baths still work
though—if you're lucky.
Postgraduate Affairs
Dear Mr Harrington,
As a member of staff much
concerned with postgraduate studies
both at College and University
level, I would endorse many of
Chris Riley's comments in Felix,
Issue 928, and see no reason why
he should be so contrite, issue 929,
because some of his associates
apparently over-reacted; maybe
they had reason. The problems are
not unique to this College: they are
found throughout London
University, are fairly common and
sometimes severe.
Difficulties arise because
postgraduates are often unaware of
their rights and supervisors of their
responsibilities—there is a fine line
between neglect and giving a
postgraduate enough inependence to
reach academic maturity.
University regulations, for
example, allow a postgraduate, with
reasonable justifications, to change
their supervisor; this can occur with
or without the consent of the
supervisor. If the student's support
is tied in some way to the
supervisor, as opposed to a
Research Council quota award to
the Department, complications
may, of course, arise but they are
not insurmountable in this context.
One's overriding fear in this
matter is, however, that comments
such as those of Chris Riely may be
used as ammunition by some to
stand yet another worthy aspect of
academic life on its head for no
good reason. There is no doubt that
there have been numerous preludes
to this and postgraduate training has
hitherto been spared only because
of the intense focus on
undergraduate studies. A few timely
and intelligently applied constraints
and adjustments are all that is really
required to bring about the
necessary improvements. May I
advise my colleagues to start by
reading, or re-reading, 'Research
Student and Supervisor—an
approach to good supervisor
practice' issued by the SERC (June, •
1989); these were once obtainable
from the Registry.
Yotirs sincerely,
A.G. Dickerson (Dr),
Biochemistry.
