Please note that to gain the full
experience of this article, you must
plug your nose and drop the London
accent. We advise this due to the
fact that expert linguists (a Scouse,
a Swiss, and a wanna be 112
American) tell us that we have a
nasal sound.
We weren't quite sure what to
expect when we scouted out London
Semester at Long Beach State.
Supposedly cultured and educated
people (actually, just stiff) told us
what to and not to do as well as
what to and not to say. In short, we
were told exactly what London and
England were like from people who
thought they knew. What we found
is a whole other story...
Everyone at home told us to
beware of the food and the people!
They told us to 'try everything—
but don't get your hopes up; the
height in English food is the
availability of foreign foods.' We
were told to avoid English stuff and
to go for Indian or Thai. 'English
food is bland, thick, and you'll hate
it.' We were advised to get a flat i
with a kitchenette so we could do
our own American cooking lest we
starve or toss our cookies! Agreed!
But we have some favorites:
rashers, crumpets and breads, tea,
cider, snakebites (with
blackcurrant, or course!).
However, Coke, Rosarita,
Campbells, and Heinz (note: Heinz
with a 'zee', not a 'zed') need to
take some full on cooking lessons.
Give me a break! There's no way
on earth they even begin to taste
anything like they were meant to!
You guys totally need wine coolers,
wanker roasts, In-n-Out burgers,
and 24 hrs Denny's to get the full
American flavour. But then again,
we ain't in Kansas no more, Toto,
even though certain companies
think they are!
We were also warned that all
English people were cold, and that
it was perfectly fine to refer to them
as Brits. Not! First of all, 'Brits
aren't cold! We found that most of
the people we've run into (once or
several times), have been kind,
warm, and, yes, even helpful-
honest! When Cindy and I get
lost—London, Bath, Brighton, or
wherever—people just seem to
know and walk over to us and either
point us in the right direction or take
us there (I've often wondered if we
just look like totally pathetic
dweebs). Sainsbury's is also an eye
opener—trying to describe Crisco
to a 'Brit' can be quite exasperating,
but they always listen, and usually
laugh. By the way, Crisco is not
something that one does or doesn't
do, unless it's in connection with
mud wrestling or twister. Even
trying to find plain dry white cake
mix can be a most excellent
adventure. The best example ofthis
warm kindness can be seen in my
recent adventures in Russia when
my wallet, money and credit cards
were stolen. People I barely knew
were offering me use of their credit
cards and cash—for whatever I
needed! Not 'at home! No trust or
such concern there when it comes
to strangers and money. On that
same trip, after my companions had
a bit of Jack Daniels, peppered
vodka, and champagne it was
announced that 'Brits' was not a
real word, and kind a' annoying ya'
know—you know like, yanks and
American or Beefeaters and
yoeman.

Truly Frightening
Many Imperial students will be
unaware of the recent advances that
have been made in a sinister
research programme being carried
out at a secret laboratory complex
in West London. Felix can reveal
in the following exclusive article the
nature of these studies.
The experiments involve
development of spores thought to
form effective biological weapons.
Discoveries made at IC have
enabled scientists to grow these
spores on mass. Incubating
laboratories have been given the
secret codename 'the bathrooms',
and disguised with ordinary
bathroom fittings.
Water appears to be a key factor
in the process. One senior insider
said 'Ooh, init shocking? Water
floods all over the floor and behind
the bath and it starts it all growing,
dunnit..'. She added mysteriously
'but why are you asking me love,
I'm only the cleaner.' Cleaner -
clearly being a pseudonym for a
senior laboratory technologist.
In a callous trial of these new
weapons students are driven into the
laboratories, or 'bathrooms', to be
infected by spores. They are then
subjected to cruel demands for
money referred to by scientists as
'rent'. Once infected few students
resist payment, deluded into
believing that they face a long,
slow, painful death if these requests
are challenged.
Scientists at Porton Down, the
Government's biological and
chemical weapons research unit,
claimed 'We don't know what the
hell you're talking about. Try
calling a plumber for God's sake.'
The site, code name C L A Y - P -
ZERO-nds or CLAY-P-O-nds, has
been likened to the area round
Chernobyl. One student claimed
'You can't go near the place now,
it's like - Z O N E 3 - too far out
man... far out, you know what I
mean?'.
