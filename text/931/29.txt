Felix Felix 931 18 March 1992
So the last issue of the term comes
around again and they have given
me a whole page... fanfare of
trumpets please. I have survived
another term without being sued for
libel, which really is quite a surprise
all things considering. However,
this may be changed by this issue
as some very interesting details
have come to light regarding some
rather important college
management type people. As you
would have read in the news round
up for this term (if you haven't read
it you really should, Declan did a
storming report and is in danger of
being sued himself if you ask me),
the 'Who's sleeping with who in
Sherfield/Princes Gardens' award
has had to be dropped. Could this
perhaps have something to do with
on and are usually so thick that they
let even the most confidential news
out after only a few G&T's. How
do you think we found out about
this scandal in the first place.
Should I name them? Have J.any
integrity at all? Do I want to be at
College next year? 1 can honestly
answer yes to all three of these
question but as they are a conflict
of interests all 1 can say is Mr G and
Ms S, you got away with it this
time!
What I can report on though is
my fellow Felixites. Declan Curry
deserves a mention, anyone who is
capable of spending 36 minutes in
conference with Peter Brooke,
secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, is worth a mention
especially as I won the sweep stake
astronomical, that they wouldn't
make it to the interview due to a
bomb scare on the underground
(again) and all times langing from
one minute to one hour. As we
understand it Declan has managed
to wangle a job working for the
BBC over the summer so you never
know we may see him standing
outside Westminster yet!
And now, the sloppy bit...
It was leap year this year, and it
seems as though romance was
definitely in the air for some. Simon
Gibbons (RCS VP) and Sarah
Goodchild (Rag Treasurer) are now
pledged to be wed, but who popped
the question? When confronted in
the bar recently both of them denied
asking the other but rumour has it
that it went something like the
The Dear Marge Column
In the final
arrivederci of
the term, Marge
lashes out at all
and sundry, and
damn those libel
writs!
the fact that the two non-students
involved are both married and one
gained her job by somewhat
dubious means? Or maybe it is just
because Felix has gained some
journalistic integrity over the last
few months and is no longer
attempting to stir up the shit with
the largest wooden spoon available?
We could find out for definate by
ringing Mr. G's secretary - they
always seem to know what's going
held in the office for how long he
would actually last in the interview
room, although after hearing
Declan's interview technique I
wouldn't have been surprised if Mr
Brooke had had to leave because of
nervous stress. My ticket was
35-39.59 minutes, other
possibilities were that Declan
wouldn't get past security, that the
time it would take for Declan to
read out the first question would be
following:
Simon: Sarah, you're looking
worried.
Sarah: Yes. will you marry me?
The big question is what was she
looking worried about? Her
forthcoming election campaign, the
ladder in her stockings, the time of
her next lecture or something else?
Answers on a post card please to the
Felix office; we might even be able
to find a prize for the most
imaginative answer. Still on the
subject of 29th February, Simon
and Sarah were not the only two
with the irresistable desire to do
something completely barmy, two
people got married! And they were
drunk at the time - exceedingly so
as we have heard. It was the day of
the F K H booze cruise to France,
they were in France and obviously
in love, not necessarily with each
other, but they were in love. She
popped the question, he said yes
(foolish man), they found a registry
office and kaboom they were man
and wife. We have had reports that
they were so drunk they don't
remember doing it, but if you ask
me, to be that drunk you would
normally have to be passed out in
a corner. Oh well, congratulations
to Mr and Mrs Chris Collinson of
Falmouth Keogh Hall. What I want
to know now is - has it been
consummated yet, and if so how
does Yasmin's long term boyfriend
feel about all this?
I really have nothing more to say
except to all those people out in the
quad on Friday night / Saturday
morning - that was not at all discreet
and unavoidable! (It was Marge
herself - oh. the hypocrisy of it all
- Ed)
Happy Easter to everyone and for
those of you who do beleive in the
Easter Bunny, enjoy your eggs!
