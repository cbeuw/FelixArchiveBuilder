18 March 1992 Felix 931 Feature
fancy turns lightly to thoughts of
love. The hotel offered optional
ballroom dancing for those with a
fancy for the elderly and 'confused'
(read 'senile') woman or man.
Kevin, being the true gentleman that
he is, rescued a lonely damsel and
took to the floor in such style he
almost knocked her off her
zimmerframe. While such
frolicsome antics were afoot, the
squash teams were already beating
Camborne 3-2 for the trophy.
Congratulations are in order to all
who played. At this point those who
played should have been named, but
somebody ran off with the list of
names from the Felix office. Many
apologies to all concerned.
A night out on the town for some
and a night of psyching up and
tactical talks for others. And the
first official RSM Ladies night out
on the town. We took the place by
storm - well almost - and we did
beat the locals on the pool table at
the nearest watering hole.
Saturday morning - 7.30 am - and
the ladies are raring to roll. A full
English at the hotel, then bags
packed and minds in gear we piled
into the minibus, complete with
four supporters, and headed off for
our all-important Hockey match. A
tight-lippedely, teeth-grindingly,
buttock-clenchingly close game and
an immense amount of fun for all
involved. The 0-0 draw meant that
the R S M managed to retain the
Goldsmith's Trophy from last year,
even if it was only by default. No
injuries incurred on our side
although Lisa managed to send off
their star player with a suspected
broken nose within the first five
minutes. On being questioned about
the incident, she told waiting
reporters that 'it was an accident,
honest.' Well, we believe you Lisa
'All fat
and flabby'
even if thousands wouldn't. Again
congratulations to all our players.
Men's hockey next and another
very close game. The RSM lost 1-0
but I'm sure that it was the
Neanderthal savagery of the
opposition in attacking Greg that
was at the fulcrum of the failure.
This meant that he had to leave the
pitch to get his eye glued back
together again at Truro Hospital.
Paul Smith gave a storming
performance in goal, saving the
C S M penalty flick with great

finesse. Unlucky for the team but
a much better score than last year's
9-1 loss.
I was unable to watch the next
competition, Football, but I did get
a chance to have a break and a
pleasant chat with the nurse at the
hospital. I assume that the R S M
men did O K , as we won 3-2.
Congratulations to them all and I
must say I'm impressed that you all
managed to make it to the game
after staying up virtually all night
and disturbing a couple of young
ladies at the hotel. Curtains to be
politely drawn, over such
shennanigans.
And so now to the magnum opus.
the clash of the Olympians. That the
very rock beneath Cornwall should
shudder at the pounding of such
Titans! The star team was dressed
in a very sexy new strip, replete
with lovely legs and the mandatory
well-preened hair on Kurt Budge's
head. So to the 'Bottle Match.'
I am left speechless with
admiration at the manner in which
the supporters played out their role.
Hods of really loud obnoxious
singing, loads of beer consumed
and a generally wholesome spirit.
As for the players - they were under
a lot of pressure from the start. The
Camborne team had the weight in
the scrum ('mainly because they
were all fat and flabby' - Gina), and
they had the upper hand from the
moment they scored their try after
about five minutes of play. The
RSM team fought back though with
a superb try by Jason Brewer, set
up by Kenny, but sadly the
conversion was missed by only a
few inches. The penalty goal by
C S M gave them the match but not
so much by skill as luck. 7-4 to
CSM but still an enjoyable game.
(They say that there is more to be
gained from the playing than the
winning - Vm not so sure myself -
Ed) Man of the match from my
point of view goes to Kenny, who
can only be likened to speedy
Gonzales when on the Rugby pitch.
The player's dinner was the usual
riot, butter fights before the starter,
loud singing throughout and trifle
fights over dessert. I think a good
time was had by all although to be
quite honest I was not totally
coherent for the most of the evening
in question, but I am sure I'm not
the only one.
Huge congratulations go to Steve
who organised the weekend, things
went pretty smoothly although I
have to pass on a rather esoteric
message on behalf of the Ladies'
Hockey team - 'we would have
liked more warning that our match
had been moved from 12.00pm to
10.00am, with love and hugs.'
In my capacity as Felix trivia
editor - a new post created
especially for me, which will
probably expand to take over the
rest of the paper - I will round up
a few of the plethora of faux pas of
the weekend. Honourable mentions
must go to -
a) Kevin Short and Dave
Maynard, who spent the best part
of an hour cheering for RSM at the
wrong Rugby match. It was no.
until half time that they noticed they
didn't actually recognise any of the
players and that neither of the teams
were in RSM college colours.
b)Richard Lloyd for losing his
crutches on the Friday night and
having to 'borrow' a walking stick
from the owner of the Hotel in
Newquay. The reason he was on
crutches in the first place is a bit of
a faux pas too - he had dislocated
his kneecap 10 days before the
bottle match was due to take place.
I don't think he was a very happy
bunny at all that weekend.
c)Nick Correy for passing out at
the player's dinner before the first
glass of wine had even been poured.
He then completely missed his meal
and lay comatose in the foyer for
the majority of the evening. While
he was in repose, Rob Peters who
was keeping an eye on him thought
that maybe the hotel foyer pot plants
were feeling a little hungry and so
he fed them the remainder of his
half chicken.
d)The CSM egit called Paul who
agreed to swap his pure silk CSM
Colours tie and tour hat for one of
our very lovely R S M hats.
e)Paul, the Norwegian RSM bod,
who spent the whole weekend
'Tangoing' people because he'd
seen the advert on the Friday
morning just before we left RSM
and thought that it was the best thing
ever. Therefore do not be surprised
if a number of people walk up to
you in the bar on Wednesday
evening and slap you around the
cheeks for no apparent reason - it
seems to have become a bit of a
trend.
f) Dave Maynard (again) for
hopping out of the minibus at the
side of the road to go for a piss and
being so inebriated that he fell over
into fits of laughter and needed
three guys to help him back up
again. Shortly after this, Rob from
C S M ripped his boxers off him
without even attempting to undo
Dave's trousers, Dave then proceed
to wear them around his neck for
the rest of the trip home.
g)Kenny for setting fire to Gina's
leggings in the back of the mini-bus
and causing the young girlie to go
into a state of shock.
h)Me for agreeing to write this
bloody article for Felix in the first
place. (That's enough of that -Ed).
And so a final warning to all -
next year C S M will be here, so
watch out and remember - You
have been officially Tangoed!
