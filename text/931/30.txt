'I'm not a Scot, but you only have
to go to Scotland to see how
Scottish it, in fact, is.'
This stunningly inane comment,
or one very similar to it (I didn't
have time to write it down), was
made by a senior British politician
on the midday news last Sunday.
The fact that it was the Prime
Minister who said this is irrelevant,
it could very well have been any
politician. The only reason I bring
up that it was the PM is because I
asked myself why we elected him
as PM, only to realise a few seconds
later that we didn't.
The five main strategies
politicians use during their
skirmishes with the media include
the Complete and Utter Denial, the
Rottweiler Strategy, the 7 think the
question that is important is...'
Evasion, the Furious Argument and
the rarely seen 'Man of the People'
directive.
Remember that a politician is
playing to an audience, and in 'the
Denial' the audience is assumed to
be plain thick, which correctly
targets a large percentage of the
population. Example:
Interviewer: 'Will you negotiate
with a third party if there is a hung
parliament?'
Politician: 'Well, as we are going
to win the next election, this
situation will not arise.'
Interviewer: 'Your party has a
reputation for raising taxes to fund
the public sector...'
Politician: 'No it doesn't.'
Subtlety does not play a major
part in this ploy. Next, the
Rottweiler 'Maul the Interviewer'
Attack.
Politician in mid-spiel: ' and
I say again that under no
circumstances will we...'
(Interviewer makes sounds of
getting word in edgeways)
Politician: 'no, no, let me finish
this point, you can have your say
when I've finished you didn't
interrupt M r Bloggs of the
oppposite party when he had his
say ' etcetera.
Interviewer: 'Will your party
increase the funding of public
transport if it gets into power?'
Politician: 'I am shocked that you
attempt to make political capital out
of such tragedies as the Clapham
Rail disaster. Absolutely apalling.
Two of my constituents were
seriously wounded in that episode
- I know because I saw them in
hospital....'
This ploy is intended to make the
audience empathise with the poor,
beleagured politician who is only
trying to do his job but is being
brutally and maliciously attacked by
editorial
self-important journalists. Thirdly,
the Evasions.
Interviewer: What is your
party's position on Scottish
devolution?"
Politician: 'Firstly, let me make
it quite clear that our party
wholeheartedly supports the objects
and ideals of European Union. I.
myself, have travelled across the
E E C to study the economic health
of small nations ' (etc).
Interviewer: 'Is your umbrella
stripey, or does it have spots?"
Politician T don't think that is
really the issue at stake in this
instance, but what I do think is
important is that when the right
circumstances arise, we will piay
our cards close to our chest, we will
defend the sovereignity of these
islands and we will not allow the
economy to be hijacked by
unscrupulous quick-buck
fly-by-nights....'
The reason for taking this path
could be that either that the
politician doesn't know the answer
but won't admit it, that the question
is somewhat sensitive so he or she
won't answer it or that he or she is
determined to say something on a
particular subject and no jumped up
little toad of a journalist is going to
stop them. The 'Furious Argument'
cannot be scripted. It involves two
politicians shouting each other
down simultaneously. The benefits
of this are twofold - the interviewer
can't ask anything and the listener
can't understand anything. Next the
'Man of the People.'
Interviewer: 'Your party's
economic policies have been
damned as unworkable widely in
the press. How would you
respond?'
Politician: T was born and
brought up in a run down street in
a dismal midlands town. My father
was killed in a mining accident and
all twenty of us children were
brought up by our one legged
mother - the other one was lost
when a German bomb destoyed our
home - it wasn't much but we called
it home - so don't talk to me about
economics. In fact, in 1968 '
etc.
This latter shot actually included
some evasion and attack as well,
and said nothing of any relevance.
A pretty good example. The basic
premise of a politicians answer is
to take as long possible, thus
reducing the opportunity for the
interviewer to object or issue
further questions. Their motto is
'senatorus silenti senatorus mortus"
- a silent politician is a dead
politician. Watch out for them.
They are coming your way soon.
