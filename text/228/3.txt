was the originator o f experimental

served to show even m o r e clearly the

wherever possible, but also highlighted
the difficulties encountered i n beha-
v i o u r of their prototype. P r o b a b l y
because a large n u m b e r o f the people
present were specially concerned w i t h
p r o b l e m s of sedimentology, every
c o n t r i b u t i o n sparked off a seines of
comments a n d questions w h i c h made
the d a y a very lively a n d useful one.
