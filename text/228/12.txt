g r o u p s at t h e heart o f British Industry,
offers a f e w o u t s t a n d i n g g r a d u a t e s , in
science, engineering or the arts, a career
keyed f r o m the start t o the areas in w h i c h
e x p a n s i o n is at its f a s t e s t . . . o p p o r t u n i t y
at its best.
This is T&N
The T & N group is a major supplier of basic
materials to Britain's manufacturing a n d e x -
port industries. W i t h a large and g r o w i n g stake
in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in brake
linings a n d in plastics, T & N is closely linked
to four major areas of e c o n o m i c g r o w t h — to
the b u i l d i n g , motor and plastics industries, and
to activity in the d e v e l o p i n g C o m m o n -
wealth territories.
T & N thus offers p r o m i s i n g graduates a really
w o r t h w h i l e career w i t h an outstanding o p p o r -
tunity to contribute to Britain's industrial a n d
export drive.
Earlier responsibility
T & N ' s broad a n d flexible training s c h e m e is
planned to e m p l o y all your university attain-
ments to the full, and to equip y o u to assume
managerial responsibility more c o n f i d e n t l y —
and certainly earlier—than is often the case in
industry today.
Wider scope for development
Suitable trainees are given the opportunity to
attend, at an appropriate stage in their training,
a year's course at a university w i t h a v i e w to
taking a Master's degree or recognised d i p l o m a
in management. A s your career develops, the
tremendous s c o p e of T & N ' s activities offers
y o u an unusually broad range of opportunities
— f r o m factory m a n a g e m e n t to marketing, e x -
port, personnel m a n a g e m e n t or research.
A career in research
T & N also recruits scientists a n d engineers
w i t h first or higher degrees direct into its
research a n d development branches. O p p o r -
tunities for supervising w o r k w i t h a practical
application, as w e l l as for f u n d a m e n t a l re-
search, are outstandingly g o o d .

Halls Review
F E W E R APPLICATIONS
LAST Y E A R
WIDE DISCREPANCIES in
the chances of P G and under-
graduate applicants in obtaining
hall places, emerge in a report
from Mike Wilson (Halls repre-
sentative on Council).
F r o m a p p l i c a t i o n s a n d acceptances
f o r places i n h a l l i n this a c a d e m i c
year i t emerged that 38 per cent o f
applicants a p p l y i n g f o r a first year i n
f l a i l were accepted a n d that 46 p e r
cent a p p l y i n g f o r a second year were
accepted; h o w e v e r 62 per cent o f post
graduates a p p l y i n g f o r second years i n
H a l l were successful. A p p l i c a t i o n s
were received f r o m 4 0 per cent o f
undergraduates a n d 15 p e r cent o f
post graduates. T h i s shows a w i d e
discrepancy w i t h the Rector's survey
t w o years ago f r o m w h i c h i t appeared
that 75 per cent o f undergraduates
and 50 p e r cent o f P o ' u w a n t e d to
l i v e i n H a l l .
O n the basis o f this report, the
sub-committee o f C o u n c i l , set u p to
l o o k into methods o f selection f o r
r o o m s i n H a l l s o f residence has made
I the m a j o r r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s that the
n u m b e r o f places i n H a l l f o r staff
members s h o u l d be reduced to 19
f r o m 25, a n d that the percentage o f
residents accepted f o r a second year
s h o u l d f a l l to between 15 a n d 20,
c o m p a r e d w i t h the present 2 5 .
T h i s is because the a c t u a l percent-
age o f people i n residence f o r other
than their 1st year is 30-35, i n c l u d i n g
W a r d e n s places, U n i o n places, a n d the
places o f Senior U n i o n officials.
It is r e c o m m e n d e d that greater p u b -
licity f o r the H a l l a p p l i c a t i o n f o r m s
and w i d e r d i s t r i b u t i o n o f these a n d
the H a l l o f residence b o o k l e t w o u l d
lead to a larger n u m b e r o f applicants
(especially f r o m members o f staff), a n d
this w i t h m o r e f l e x i b i l i t y i n the choice
of residents (ceasing to regard the
suggested percentages o f the v a r i o u s
categories as m a n d a t o r y ) w i l l lead to
m o r e , a n d m o r e suitable people g a i n -
ing places i n H a l l .
