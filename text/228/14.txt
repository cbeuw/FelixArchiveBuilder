new men...
new knowledge...
new problems to be solved...
Today's children will grow up in a world that is
being remade before their eyes. They will have a
wider range of opportunities. They will also face
problems calling for new solutions. Today's
children need the most imaginative and creative
teaching. Teaching by men and women who are
among the ablest of their generation... graduates
who are among the most outstanding of their
year. Teachers have greater influence on future
generations than any other profession.
What does Teaching offer you in return ?
New opportunities
T e a c h i n g is a vigorous and growing profession. I t offers
the graduate greater opportunities than ever before,
both i n developing professional skills a n d i n achieving
posts of influence a n d responsibility — often far earlier
than i n m a n y other careers. F o r example, nearly h a l f of
the men graduate teachers between 25 a n d 29 hold such
posts a n d receive salaries well above the basic scale.
A b o u t h a l f o f those i n their 30's are heads o f depart-
ments, earning u p to £2,330, or h o l d even higher posts.
O n e fifth of those now i n their 40's are headmasters w h o
m a y earn salaries u p to £3,850. T h e prospects are even
better for graduates w i t h first or second class honours, o r
a higher degree.
New ideas - new initiative
T h e mastery of teaching skills a n d the evolution of n e w
methods are a'stimulating challenge. N e w discoveries
a n d new knowledge present teachers w i t h problems for
w h i c h there are n o precedents. N e w c o m m u n i c a t i o n
techniques a n d aids must be developed.
Training: anrextension of your knowledge
Some graduates feel uncertain whether they a r e
temperamentally suited to teaching. T h e one-year
post-graduate training course equips y o u to start y o u r
career confidently o n a basis o f practical experience
as well as theory.

OXFORD TOUR
The Imperial College Squash Club's
visit to Oxford on the weekend of the

N o t only did the two teams win all
their matches, but also the Oxford
