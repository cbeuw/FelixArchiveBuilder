Victory in Melville-Smith
IC will now meet
world class players
by J . F . Gibson
I.C. qualified for the second round of the
Melville-Smith trophy when beating a North
London team by 10 imps (international
match points) in a close, keenly contested,
match. This competition differs from most
of the other national events in that it is a
ruling that no more than a third of the hands
may be played by the same partnership.
Two substitutes are allowed but generally,
just one team of four operates, each player
playing ten hands with the other three
players in turn, with the match being decided
on thirty hands.
T h i s p a r t i c u l a r o p p o s i t i o n h a d the scalps of a
leading i n t e r n a t i o n a l team to their credit f r o m an
encounter the previous week, a n d they went i n t o
the m a t c h full of confidence, w h i c h m a y well h a v e
been responsible for their u l t i m a t e u n d o i n g . C e r -
tainly, their b i d d i n g was at times distinctly o p t i -
mistic, as can be judged f r o m one of the e a r l i e r
hands.

In b o t h r o o m s , S o u t h opened w i t h a standard
A c o l 2 H b i d (showing 8 p l a y i n g t r i c k s w i t h hearts
as trumps), a n d N o r t h gave the negative response
of 2 N . T . , the o p p o s i t i o n r e m a i n i n g silent. S o u t h
has n o a d d i t i o n a l features i n his h a n d over a n d
above those he has a l r e a d y s h o w n o n his o p e n i n g
b i d , except six hearts, so the o n l y sensible course
open to h i m w o u l d appear to be to b i d 3 - H , w h i c h
N o r t h must pass o n his weak h o l d i n g . T h i s is
w h a t a c t u a l l y happened at the table, where
I.C. were sittin?. N o r t h - S o u t h , a n d after a n o p e n i n g
lea i of the D i ' . m o n d seven f r o m West, declarer
had no difficulty i n w r a p p i n g up 12 tricks.
O u r days i n this c o m p e t i t i o n apnear to be n u m -
bered, however, f o r i n the next r o u n d , we have
been d r a w n against last year's eventual winners,
w h o i n c l u d e d , f r o m time to time, such players as
Reese, F l i n t , K o n s t a m , a n d P r i d a y i n their team.
In this event, the n o r m a l tactics adopted are to
preserve the most experienced partnership f o r
the final session, a n d to open w i t h the most inex-
perienced. It is m y o w n personal o p i n i o n that
w h e n the dice are h e a v i l y loaded against one team
(as w i l l certainly be the case w i t h us i n the next
r o u n d ) , it m i g h t be sound p o l i c y to reverse the
procedure. T i is w o u l d entail o p e n i n g w i t h the
strongest p a r t n r s h i p s , e n d e a v o u r i n g to establish
an early lead against relatively inexperienced
c o m b i n a t i o n s , w h i c h m i g h t induce the oppositions
later partnerships to over-reach themselves i n try-
i n g to p u l l back the l e a d . It seems to be the only
w a y that we stand a n y chance at a l l against such
r e d o u b t a b l e o p p o s i t i o n .
A t the other table, however, S o u t h m a d e the
very a m b i t i o u s call of 3 N T oyer partners negative
2 N T h o p i n g that partner w o u l d h o l d stops i n
b o t h the black suits or, f a i l i n g that, the o p p o s i -
tion w o u l d m u t i l a t e the defence b e i n g i n e x p e r i -
enced i n partnership (as was the case i n the first
session). W h i l s t it was true the defence missed
a trick w h e n the club suit was blocked, neverthe-
less eight tricks were taken after a n o p e n i n g spade
lead f r o m E a s t for a score of 200 to E - W . W i t h a
score of 230 to N - S at the other table, this gave
I.C. a s w i n g of 430 o r d i n a r y points, corresponding
to 10 i m p s , w h i c h was exactly equal to the ultimate
victory m a r g i n . It is interesting to note that
South w i l l almost certainly succeed i n m a k i n g 4 H
(although he c a n lose f o u r top black suit tricks),
for West is most u n l i k e l y to lead a w a y f r o m a
K i n g . F u r t h e r m o r e , 6 H m a y well be made if b i d ,
for by the same arguments, a black suit is u n -
l i k e l y to be l e d , unless E a s t uses a L i g h t n e r double,
w h i c h for a s l a m contract calls for a n unusual
lead.
