Anti-Semitism
in USSR
A C A M P A I G N by the World Union of Jewish Students against
anti-semitism in the Soviet Union reached I.C. on March 1st, when
the Jewish and Communist Societies held a joint meeting addressed
by Gordon Hansman, a law student from University College. He
began his talk by stating that he was neither pro-communist, nor anti-
communist, but merely a Jew who was interested in combating anti-
semitism wherever it might occur.
Anti-semitism in the Soviet Union manifests itself in a number
of forms. First of all there is anti-semitism on an " official" level.
At one time, just after the revolution, Jews flooded into the Univer-
sities and into the professions which had been denied to them under
the Czars. To-day these numbers are small and falling, whereas the
statistics for other minority groups remain fairly constant.
