LANGUAGE LAB. IN ELEC ENG
New methods for
language teaching
in the College
On level six hi the electrical engineering
block there is a language laboratory. This
was purchased by the Electrical Department
for £3,500, just about half the cost of the
cofered walk-way between the mechanical
and electrical blocks.
A language l a b o r a t o r y consists of a set of t n e
recorders i n s o u n d - p r o o f booths. O n e student sits
in each booth a n d listens to a tape p l a y i n g selected
phrases and sentences i n the f o r e i g n language. H e
t i e n attempts to r e c o r d the s o u n d w h i c h he has
heard on his o w n track of the tape recorder. H e
m a y then play the tape back and hear any mistakes
w h i c h he is m i k i n g . T h e teacher sits at a central
console f r o m w h i c h he m a y switch into any of the
booths and c o n t r o l the w o r k of the student.
bsimu.ianeous classes in different languages
now possible
T h e r e is no need f o r the students to be s t u d y i n g
the same language, a n d a l l can go at their o w n
speed. Spectacular results have been c l a i m e d for
teaching by means of language laboratories. It is
asserted that by u s i n g w e l l prepared tapes under
the s u p e r v i s i o n o f a n expert a n e w language m a y
be taught i n three weeks up to a conversational
level. W h e n used o n its o w n , l e a r n i n g i n a

orally a n d w i t h o u t recourse to the student's native
tongue. H o w e v e r , f o r this m e t h o d to be success-
f u l it is necessary to spend at least one h o u r a d a y
i n the l a b o r a t o r y .
Laboratory being used by second
engineers as part of their course
year
In the p r o g r a m of n o n - t e c h n i c a l studies w h i c h
is part of the course f o r second year engineers the
students f r o m the E l e c t r i c a l a n d M e c h a n i c a l
D e p a r t m e n t s have a R u s s i a n language o p t i o n . T h e y
spend one hour per week i n the l a b o r a t o r y w h i c h is
a t h i r d of the total t i m e devoted to language study.
T h e l a b o r a t o r y has h a d one term's e x p e r i m e n t a l
use. M r . R u t e n b e r g , a lectu»er i n the E l e c t r i c a l

is able to say that he is pleasantly surprised by the
progress made this year.
Hope that three language option can bt
offered to second year in future
T h e l a b o r a t o r y is also being used by some of
the other language classes i n the college, but the
present lack of trained staff means that it is. i m -
posi'ible to use the l a b o r a t o r y f u l l y . It is hoped
that it w i l l be possible to offer a choice of three
languages to the second year students i n 1966/7
and to e x p a n d the courses offered to other m e m -
bers of the college. It is also thought that the
l a b o r a t o r y m i g h t be of use i n h e l p i n g overseas
students w i t h their c o n v e r s a t i o n a l E n g l i s h at the
b e g i n n i n g of their courses.
