S I R ,
A s a " f o r e i g n e r " i n this
c o u n t r y ( a n d o n e w h o intends
to g o back) I have often been
h a r d p u t t o u n d e r s t a n d E n g l i s h
b e h a v i o u r a n d customs. H o w -
ever, I w a s quite astounded to
hear i n a c o n v e r s a t i o n at a H a l l
dinner, " O h , S . . . ., that's
where a l l the wogs are ! "
T h e t e r m " w o g " is accepted
to be derogatory a n d i n s u l t i n g ,
i.e., i f o n e w a n t s t o score o v e r
a foreigner, o n e u s u a l l y h a s
o n l y to say, " Y o u b l . . . .
w o g ! "
I n these h a r d times of r a c i a l
understanding, I f i n d it most
depressing that supposedly
highlv-educated people i n this
c o u n t r y use such language
(consciously o r even u n c o n -
sciously). T h e r e f o r e , I s h o u l d
like to m a k e a plea that gentle-
m e n of this C o l l e g e r e f r a i n
f r o m using s u c h terms w h i c h
are designed t o create r a c i a l i l l -
feeling.
A t the danger of b e i n g ac-
cused of b e i n g a r a c i a l w a r -
m o n g e r , I s h o u l d l i k e t o r e m i n d
p e o p l e here that there a r e
m a n y thousands o f E n g l i s h
people a b r o a d a n d that r a c i a l
tolerance w i l l be of benefit t o
b o t h parties.

S I R ,
T i m D o e , late N e w s E d i t o r
of F E L D C , i n the last issue a c -
cused S E N N E T o f b e i n g short
of news.
T h i s has been one of m y
c o m p l a i n t s against this paper
ever since I began s t u d y i n g i t
w e e k l y after j o i n i n g the F E L I X
Staff at the b e g i n n i n g of last
t e r m . It seems obvious t o m e
that the E d i t o r s of that i l l u s -
trious newspaper have the u t -
most difficulty i n collecting
copy.
T o o m u c h of the paper is
filled u p every week w i t h b o r -
ine, p o o r l y - w r i t t e n m a t e r i a l that
has little place i n what is, after
a l l , the newspaper of the U n i -
versity of L o n d o n U n i o n .
F o r e x a m p l e , the reviews
A non-ideal situation
T h e recent fuss a b o u t F E L I X ' s a n o n y m o u s c o l u m n i s t s left

m e n t is p r o b a b l y less distasteful w h e n a u t h o r s h i p is concealed.
H o w e v e r , the fact r e m a i n s that w e have t w o people s t r a i n i n g
t h e i r l i m i t e d intelligence t o p r o d u c e t h e d u l l m a t e r i a l w h i c h
r e g u l a r l y fills a considerable part of F E L I X ' s centre pa'ges. T w o
results f o l l o w . F i r s t l y , that F E L I X ' s readers are b o r e d , a n d
secondly that p o t e n t i a l l y better m a t e r i a l is e x c l u d e d . F o r instance,
the H o l y H u d d l e w a s refused a regular i n F E L I X o n the grounds
of lack o f space. N o d o u b t the n e w l y - f o r m e d P o l i t i c a l C o u n c i l
c o u l d also be persuaded t o m a k e a r e g u l a r c o n t r i b u t i o n .
In m y o p i n i o n , these t w o sources, each representing large sec-
tions o f the U n i o n , a n d each h a v i n g s o m e t h i n g to say, s h o u l d be
used to replace o n e o r (better) b o t h o f the present c o l u m n i s t s ,
whose w o r k is after a l l largely a n i n f e r i o r a n d often fatuous d u p l i -

the authors of the f a s h i o n a r t i -

Unfair!
S I R ,
Y o u r c r i t i c i s m of M a t h s S o c
i n the last e d i t i o n of F E L I X is
most unfair. T h e notices a d -
vertising Professor B o n d i ' s talk
were c l e a r l y m a r k e d " post-
p o n e d " after discussion o f the
matter w i t h h i m o n the F r i d a y

Loans
" Students o f I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e vote u n a n i m o u s l y
against a n y p r o p o s e d loans system," was the essence
o f the reports i n the papers the d a y after t h e last
U n i o n M e e t i n g . A n d to most people i t w o u l d
seem quite clear that I . C . h a d i n fact voted v i r t u a l l y
u n a n i m o u s l y . B u t h a d they? C e r t a i n l y a l l those
w h o attended voted f o r a c t i o n to be t a k e n , but it
was stressed f r o m the c h a i r that it was most i m -
portant f o r each person t o actually take a c t i o n
h a v i n g voted f o r this course. H o w e v e r , since the
concert h a l l was barely f u l l , some 8 0 p e r cent of
the students d i d n ' t bother t o m a k e the j o u r n e y u p
to the U n i o n . H o w m a n y o f these w i l l m a k e a n
effort a n d g o to W e s t m i n s t e r ? It is d o u b t f u l
whether h a l f o f those present w i l l go, let alone
the vast m a j o r i t y w h o were too apathetic. B u t to
say that the vote w a s u n a n i m o u s is r u b b i s h i f y o u
take a person's absence as a m a r k o f disagreement
w i t h the m o t i o n o n the floor. Surely a referendum
w o u l d have been m o r e accurate, a n d stimulated
m o r e general interest?
The Smoking Concert
T h o s e o f y o u fortunate enough to have seen a
U n i o n H a n d b o o k w i l l find, o n Page 17, a descrip-
t i o n o f the delights one m a y expect t o find at the
R . C . S , S m o k i n g C o n c e r t . " A cast d r a w n f r o m

spiced w i t h audience p a r t i c i p a t i o n . " F r o m this
description o n e m i g h t have expected a n enjoyable
evening o f " U n i o n m e e t i n g stuff" o r possible better
t h a n that, one a l w a y s lives i n hope. H o w e v e r , the

I got a free pint, a n d t o o k part, as one o f the

o f the evening w a s spent e n d u r i n g a series of
disgusting a n d degrading jokes a n d sketches w h i c h

expect some sense o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , even i n this
C o l l e g e , w h e n b a w d y entertainment is b e i n g sur-
veyed. It has its place, b u t must be subject to the
same considerations o f q u a l i t y that operate i n
respect o f other concerts a n d cabarets. O n e w o u l d
hate t o advocate censorship, b u t i f the College's
g o o d n a m e is t o be brought info disrepute by such
gross i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , then its use is obvious.
That lot again
H a v i n g criticised these gentry before f o r their
drunkenness, it makes a w e l c o m e change to be able
to congratulate t h e m o n their achievements, i n the
name of I . C . , u p to the t i m e of w r i t i n g . T o a n y
casual o n - l o o k e r , it m a y seem that their journey
