Picasso examined

Perhaps the greatest thing
about Picasso is his ability to
change. Trewin Copplestone be-
gan his second talk on 20th cen-
tury art with a statement " Picas-
so realises he is Picasso." This
has meant that Picasso has been
able to examine his own work
critically, and rapidly, such that
after completing a picture in the
morning, he has painted a second
after dinner " according to his
new mood."
Picasso is h a v i n g such a l o v e affair
w i t h his l i f e that this tremendous
c a p a c i t y f o r w o r k has m e a n t he is n o w

Vintage vehicle rally
A L O T OF talk about less talk
was the main feature of the
Union meeting on the 24th Feb.
Two motions were discussed, with
no surprising outcomes.
T h e first, proposed b y K e i t h C a v a -
nagh, was that the H o u s e s h o u l d a c -
cept the report o f the w o r k i n g party
set u p last t e r m to investigate the
loans issue. It was passed over-
w h e l m i n g l y . T h e findings a n d r e c o m -
m e n d a t i o n s of the w o r k i n g party were
put to the U n i o n b y F r a n k F u c h s .
These r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s were, b a -
sically, that as m a n y U n i o n members
as possible s h o u l d request t a see their
M P ' s o n 9th M a r c h (today), a n d p u t
f o r w a r d their views o n the subject of
loans; a n d that the U n i o n s h o u l d d o
all i t can to express its abhorrence o f
the idea of loans to students.
A m o t i o n f r o m the floor that free
coaches s h o u l d be p r o v i d e d to take
students to W e s t m i n s t e r was passed
by a large m a j o r i t y .
T h e second m o t i o n was that this
meeting accepts that the President of
I . C . U . s h o u l d be elected by the U n i o n
as a whole, a n d calls o n C o u n c i l to
set up a w o r k i n g committee to investi-
gate the best means of b r i n g i n g this
into effect.
T h i s was proposed by D a v i d
L i v e s e y . w h o subjected his audience to
a five m i n u t e harangue, a n d w h o was
: cused by the opposer, K e i t h G u y ,
of a d v o c a t i n g change " f o r change's
sake alone."' M r . L i v e s e y c :
a i m e d that
a lot of the apathy i n the C o l l e g e was
due to the present system of electing
the President, but M r . G u y m a i n t a i n e d
that the apathetic section of the C o l -
lege w o u l d then sway the vote, a n d
they w o u l d only k n o w the candidates
w h o n i e fools of themselves at v a r i -
ous fu ' :tions.
M r . D o u g a l M c C r e a t h . an e x - P r e ; i -
dent at r C a n a d i a n U n i v e r s i t y , said
that i n ais experience the open vote
system was not a g o o d one. M r .
R i s m o n d h a d gained the impression
that the constituent College Fresidents
(who sit o n C o u n c i l ) were elected f o r
their c l o w n i n g about at C c n s t i t . U n i o n
M e e t i n g s , a n d these were the sort of
peop'e the U n i o n entrusted w i t h the
election o f the President o f I . C . U .
T h e m o t i o n was defeated b y 209
votes to 77 w i t h 14 abstentions.

Colours and chemicals for industry
Graduates w h o join Geigy find that w e keep
the personal touch. W e c a n do this because
our w o r k i n g units are relatively small. Yet
G e i g y is a w o r l d - w i d e organisation, making
and selling colours a n d chemicals for the
textile, paint, paper, plastics, lubricants and
other industries, as w e l l as pharmaceutical
specialities. S o the smallness is not restricting,
since w e enjoy the benefits of pooled resources,
joint basic research and the international
exchange of k n o w l e d g e and experience.
Security need not mean stagnation: G e i g y
(founded in 1 7 5 8 ) is proud of its past, but does
not live in it. Our textile chemists have recently
developed n e w techniques for the continuous
dyeing of acrylic fibres, w o o l a n d nylon. O u r
pigment laboratories pioneered the stir-in
colours for do-it-yourself household paints. Our
speciality esters form the basis of the synthetic
lubricants used in most jet aircraft in this
country, and w e are at present w o r k i n g o n the
problems of supersonic aircraft lubrication.
There are also openings for arts and e c o n o m i c s
graduates w i t h training facilities in most aspects
of our work. Salaries, pension arrangements
and other conditions are good. If y o u w o u l d

unities open this year, write to the Personnel
Officer at the address b e l o w ; or contact your
appointments secretary w h o has all the detailsr
