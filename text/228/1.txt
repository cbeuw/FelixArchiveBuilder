No collections, say police, so
Procession may
be off
Whole
Carnival
in jeopardy
by D. I. WILLIAMS
ICs C A R N I V A L Board has
been informed by Chelsea police
that it cannot take street collec-
tions on Saturday, 14 May. The
procession of floats around the
locality may not, therefore, take
place.
This bombshell came only
minutes after IC Union Secretary
Phil Dean had announced at the
Union Meeting on Thursday, 24
February, a Red Cross collec-
tion in Kensington High Street,
which called on the College to
provide volunteers, on 10 May—
in the middle of Carnival Week.
T h e police e x p l a i n e d to A n g e l a
P r i c e , the C a r n i v a l W e e k E v e n t s
Organiser, that o n l y one street collec-
t i o n per week c o u l d be p e r m i t t e d .
S u c h events, they volunteered, have
already been p l a n n e d f o r 10 a n d 17
M a y by other bodies. T h e possibility
o f the procession t a k i n g place o n the
previous Saturday has yet to be i n -
vestigated.
M e a n w h i l e C a r n i v a l C h a i r m a n
C h r i s H o c k i n g is a p p e a l i n g to the
H o m e Office f o r a reversal of the de-
cision.
T h e request for the procession to
take place o n 14 M a y was lodged by
the B o a r d i n early J a n u a r y . T h e
C h e l s e a police i n f o r m e d the B o a r d
that this request w o u l d have to be
circulated to other l o c a l forces w i t h i n
whose districts the route w o u l d pass
before a reply was sent by S c o t l a n d
Y a r d .
E n q u i r i e s o n the d i r e c t i o n of the
route and the usual statement that
p r o g r a m m e - s e l l i n g — a n d this includes
the C a r n i v a l m a g a z i n e — o n the streets
is not a l l o w e d were settled between
the police a n d the B o a r d i n the five
ensuing weeks. A n d so the b a n c a m e
as a great shock.

Silwood Ball saved
Silwood Park Committee have
been trying to prevent the R.C.S.
from holding their annual Ball at
Silwood Park. Captain Barnes of
that Committee sent a letter to
Professor Richards of the Zoo-
logy Department, requesting that
the Ball should no longer be
held. The reason was that it
disrupted the Silwood programme
and was inconvenient for the resi-
dents.
T h i s letter was passed o n to the
President o f R C S . H e believes that
the reason for stopping the B a l l are
inadequate a n d t h i n k s that it is a
m o v e to change the i m • is of Sil.'•'<">'d.
A t the m o m e n t , S i l w o o d is k n o w n for
the B a l l and T o u c h s t o n e weekends,
a pleasant place i n the country, rather
than the research centre that it really
is.

to m a k e this year's the last S i l w o o d
B a l l . T h i s they d i d n o t agree to,
and i n the end m a n a g e d to persuade
h i m to let the B a l l continue. T h e date
chosen was the F r i d a y o f W h i t s u n
weekend as most of the staff w o u l d be
away.
