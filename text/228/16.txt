Guilds change
year rep system
• • •——
Election by all of year
GUILDS A R E not satisfie!
with their existing year rep. sys-
tem—" not working as well as it
should, shocking really" (Dai
Howell)—-and several changes
were proposed at the last Guilds
Committee Meeting.
A t present the year reps, are elected
at U n i o n meetings, not by their re-
spective years as a whole, and thus are
not truly representative of the year.
I n order to o v e r c o m e this it has been
suggested that the reps, be elected at
a meeting of the w h o l e year, under the
c h a i r m a n s h i p of a m e m b e r of G u i l d s
Executive. F u r t h e r to this a second
rep. s h o u l d be elected f r o m each year
to be concerned solely w i t h the aca-
demic interests of students. These
reps, w o u l d not sit o n the C o m m i t t e e .
T h e reps, w o u l d be a v a i l a b l e for
any duty that I.C. E x e c u t i v e wished
t h e m to fulfil, unless they were pre-
occupied w i t h Constituent C o l l e g e
duties, and I.C. C l u b s w o u l d be able
to m a k e use of t h e m o n certain oc-
casions.
It has also been proposed that
second year reps be responsible f o r
the first years as w e l l until the Easter
t e r m . T h i s w o u l d result i n better
first year reps., since by then the
F r e s h m e n w o u l d have got to k n o w
one another. T h e other elections
w o u l d take place i n the S u m m e r t e r m
i n order that the reps, m a y have a
f u l l year i n office.
The big

O N C E A G A I N this year
three consecutive issues of

live days of p u b l i c a t i o n . T o
date, the last eight of the ses-
sions ten issues have sold out,

f o r the first time i n the history
of the newspaper, r e g u l a r l y
higher than i n the preceding
a u t u m n .
DESPITE the rather tired ap-
pearance of the 'schoolchildren'
in the Lower Lounge at 5
o'clock last Saturday morning
it was generally agreed that the
Guilds-Mines Carnival had been
a great success.
Five groups—The Swinging
Blue Jeans, the Mark Barry
Group, the Derek Savage
Foundation, the New Sedalia
Jazz Band and the Clive Heath
Trio—provided music for danc-
ing from 9.30 p.m. Friday to
3 a.m. Saturday, when the film
'Blue Murder at St. Trinians'
was shown.
