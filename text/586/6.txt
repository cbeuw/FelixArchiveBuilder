Social Colours, UGAs and the whole
charade
Congratulations to Liz Lindsay on receiving
her deserved Union General Award. I cannot,
however, bring myself to congratulate John
Passmore or Rachel Snee on theirs. Only last
week M s Snee was expressing her desire to
turn down a U G A if offered one (these days, a
p r a c t i c e w i t h m o r e r e s p e c t a n d h o n o u r
a t t a c h e d to it than being thought fit to
receive one in the first place!) What a noble
thought! That she would actually think of
herself as undeserving of a U G A . N o such
luck! M s Snee's reason was she had little
respect for John Passmore as President—the
man who awards such honours. However,
Snee (two-faced as ever) would now lead us to
believe that she has renewed her faith in M r
Passmore's abilities.
Rachel Snee has only two things going for
her—the fact that she voted against John
Passmore's U G A , and the size of her breasts.
What of Passmore's U G A ? This is voted on
I wonder how many of you remember Prong and
Quirk, two of the lecherous mathematicians from
Primelia who appeared in this column last year?
Well, following the mysterious and sudden
retirement of several wardens recently, each of
them has been put in charge of two mixed halls of
residence. Primelia has four of these, all different
sizes; the largest are Lizard and Foulmouth, and
the smallest Keyhole and Selclique. Prong has
been put in charge of Lizard and Selclique and as
soon as he heard this he dropped in on the Senior
Warden to find the percentage of women in each
of the four halls.
Later he met Quirk in the Queen's Legs.
'You realise' he boasted 'that of the two larger
halls, mine has a higher proportion of women
then yours.'
'What about the smaller halls?' asked Quirk.
1 win again. Selclique has a higher proportion
of women than Keyhole.'
'It doesn't really worry me,' replied Quirk.
'Next year your two halls will be amalgamated, as
will mine, and although there is to be no
redistribution of women at all, my combined hall
will have a greater proportion of women than
yours.'
N o w you may remember that Quirk is a
statistician, and therefore is not totally truthful;
and Prong is extremely doubtful about his last
assertion. Is it possible that Quirk is telling the
truth? Or can Prong be sure he is lying?
by Union Council and hence does not carry
behind it the stigma of having been awarded by
an incompetant, lazy, good for nothing, drunk
of an I C U President. However, Council with
only a few exceptions, are the biggest bunch of
e g o - c e n t r i c , p s e u d o - p o l i t i c o , n a n c y - b o y
pettyfogging twats that I have ever had the
pleasure of insulting. Not only do they crawl up
the College's arsehole on every matter from
residence to refectories, they have the gall to
poke their heads out and shout "Hey, chaps,
come on in, it's great!"
They fail dismally to represent the students
who voted them "into power" and God-only-
knows why they think Passmore deserves a
U G A .
At this stage, let me tell you now that I'm
bloody annoyed about this and I intend to rant
and rave for a further few paragraphs yet.
Bored? Listless? Think I "go on" a bit to
much? Then piss off as you probably haven't
understood or cared about a single word I
have written this year.
May I resume, what is a U G A ? It's the
highest award doled out by the Union; all
e x c e p t for his o w n , at the P r e s i d e n t ' s
discretion. Only four or five a year. It is
awarded for oustanding contributions to the
Union.
Some say John Passmore has done "a lot
behind the scenes" and "only the bad things
get r e p o r t e d " . In no u n c e r t a i n t e r m s —
bollocks! Speaking as a serious observer of the
Union, John Passmore arrives at the office
around 10:00am, just in time for coffee. Then
he puts his feet on his desk and waits for Ruth
Hildebrand to trot up to the office. At this
point they pet for the rest of the morning.
Then they have lunch together. Then they
have sherry from the Union Office's vast
supplies of sherry (all bought out of your
Union subscriptions folks!). Then they pet
more. John then signs a few forms, gets pissed
in the Queen's and then goes to Residence
Committee where he is trampled all over due
to his brain being fuddled by alcohol. (Then he
gets more pissed in the bar and goes to bed.)
If this is the "behind the scenes" work, is it
any wonder that "only the bad things get
reported." John Passmore has done nothing
this y e a r w h i c h c o u l d be d e s c r i b e d as
constructive for the Union.
It is a mockery of the awards system and a
disgrace to the small band of people with
U G A s whom M r Passmore will be joining.
Likewise Rae Snee, who certainly could not be
described as lazy, but simply misguided by her
own personal venom for the average student.
I urge P a s s m o r e a n d Snee to consider
carefully just what a U G A means.
What about social colours? Considering the
b i t t e r n e s s , p e r s o n a l a n x i e t y a n d b i t c h y
b a c k b i t i n g t h e s e " a w a r d s " c a u s e , I a m
tempted to say scrap 'em. But so many
people seem to appreciate "being acknow
ledged for the part they played." So touching!
If you've just been awarded them, what have
you got? Basically, an ugly black, yellow and
white tie which if you dare to wear you get
labeled a poser, pseud, or hack. (I've only ever
seen three being worn and the wearers would
fit that description admirably.)
The only way to win in the social colours
street credibility points game is to adopt a
"couldn't care less" attitude. If you've just been
awarded social colours, just remember that
there's always someone who's done more who
hasn't got them and someone who has done
less who has. Where does that leave you?
While I'm trying hard not to cast aspersions
on individuals who get colours, I did notice one
thing. N o fewer than nine people received
colours for work on the I N C O S T Conference
at Easter.
While not wishing to criticise any of those
•nvolved in this worthwhile venture I would say
that if they all did one tenth (counting Liz
Lindsay) of the work involved, none of them
should have received colours. I feel colours
committee and Liz Lindsay (as chief organiser)
should have been more selective.
