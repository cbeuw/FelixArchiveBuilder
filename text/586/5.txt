The Phoenix Choir Concert
S I N C E L A S T Y E A R ' S edition of The Phoenix
was deservedly well circulated, a fair number
of you will already know a little about the
magazine. For the rest of you, however, a few
words of introduction will be in order. The
Phoenix was founded in 1886 by H G Wells,
who at the time was a student at Imperial
College. Since that time the magazine has
taken many forms, and the views and aims of
its editors have varied greatly. M r Wells would
certainly have approved of the philosophy of
the magazine over the past few years. The
aim has been to present original work by
members of the College in the field of art
rather than science; drawings, poems, stories
and articles of general interest, as well as more
obscure art forms, have all been included. This
y e a r ' s offering, e d i t e d b y S e a n G i b l i n ,
achieves this end admirably.
The magazine inevitably invites comparison
with last year's edition, but such comparisons
would be rather unfair. Although the magazine
has the same format (A4 ;size, glossy cover,
well printed on art paper, etc) the approach to
the selection of material is somewhat different.
It is noticeable, for example, that this year's
Phoenix is a lot stronger on photographs and
poetry. The poems include some real gems
(Patrick Coil's "Shall I compare thee to a pint
of G u i n n e s s ? " for example) and a lot of
t h o u g h t a n d c a r e has g o n e i n t o t h e i r
presentation and layout. It's nice to see an
original H G Wells poem reprinted from an
early edition of The Phoenix; it's well worth
buying the magazine for that poem alone. It's a
pity, though, that M r Giblin did not see fit to
r e p r i n t t h e o r i g i n a l f o o t n o t e s t o t h e
poem—surely these were just as funny as the
poem itself?
The magazine also showcases work by no
fewer than four photographers, all of whom
have turned in some very nice work. It is the
photos in particular that justify the high quality
printing.
Unfortunately, while the magazine scores
over last year's in photos and poems it loses on
p r o s e . D a v e B r i t t o n ' s " T e s t i m o n y of a
Traveller" is the only piece which stands out in
this category, the rest being rather uninterest-
ing. However, there are a number of unusual
items which more than compensate for this
fault. Ian Wieczoek's four page strip is worthy
of mention as is the page of sheet music by
Barney M c C a b e "Brontosauraus Blues". The
excellent use of artwork and the written word
to complement one another, which is apparent
throughout the magazine, is best typifisd by
the incorporation of a Scaramouche chess
puzzle into a drawing by Margaret Ramsey.
In summary, this year's Phoenix is worth
50p of anybody's money. A s with all such
productions, risks have been taken, and not
everybody will like all the material. However,
this year most of the risks seem to have paid
off. Buy one and find out for yourself.

IC Union Duplicating/Postal Services
As from June 1 all material bought from the
Union Duplicating Services has to be paid for
in cash. Cash also has to be paid by clubs and
societies using the Union postal facility.
However high the reputation of a student
c h o i r , one never quite expects t h e m to
achieve their customary standard during the
Damoclean summer term; this concert was an
o u t s t a n d i n g e x c e p t i o n . F o r a l t h o u g h
impending exams had slightly reduced the
size of the choir, they had obviously been
thoroughly rehearsed, and there was certainly
no reduction in quality.
The first work performed was Handel's Dixit
Dominus, a spectacularly lively exultation of
praise (is romp too irreverent a word?) with
plenty of fast movements demanding the
clear diction and rhythmic singing for which
IC Choir is renowned. Sadly, the opening was
rather strained, and the initial 'Dixit, dixit
Dominus Domino meo' lacked the punchy
a t t a c k it n e e d e d ; but the c h o i r q u i c k l y
warmed up and were well on top of the later
movements, even at the literally breathtaking
speeds Eric Brown took them at.
After the interval (I thought the purpose of
coffee tokens was to shorten queues) came
Mendelssohn's Second Symphony, a great
surprise to anyone who, like me, always assumed
Mendelssohn started his symphonic output
at No. 3. In fact, most of the audience seemed
quite unfamiliar with the work, and it was a pity
there was so little written about it in the
programme.
The symphony starts with three movements
following a more of less conventional pattern, but
the fourth movement takes the form of a short
cantata beginning with, ending with, and generally
based on a short motiv (Alles was Odem hat,
lobe den Herrn) which recurred so often it
seemed to be something of a joke among the
members of the orchestra.
Some of the choir were concerned lest they
repeat last t e r m ' s m i s t a k e and e x h a u s t
themselves during the first half of the concert,
leaving too little energy for the second. But the
first three movements of the Mendelssohn
obviously provided enough of a rest, and the
Lobgesang was presented with both the force and
the confidence it needed.
Much criticism has been aimed at the soloists in
previous choir concerts, but apart from the
counter-tenor who seemed to have some sort of
frog in his throat, these soloists did the choir great
credit. Among all the solos, I can't resist singling
out Richard Frewer's beautifully moving 'Hiiter,
ist die Nacht bald hin?'
But it was the choir's concert, and the choir
who made it a great concert. The tenors,
notably, produced a very fine noise, all the more
remarkable since there were only eleven of them
(I counted 'em). They also managed to avoid
being swamped by the rather heavy basses, who
on one or two occasions hinted that they might
have been more at home in Cardiff Arms Park.
The gold medal, though, must go to the
sopranos. • Dixit Dominus is a five-part work
(SSATB) so there are only half as many sopranos
singing each line. As if this wasn't enough of a
handicap. Handel rather unchivalrously makes
them sing a top B flat at every available
opportunity. Admittedly the very first high note
was a struggle, but having gained self-confidence,
the sopranos went on to produce a sound of quite
impressive clarity and controlled power and they
kept this up right to the end of the concert.
It was obvious from the prolonged applause
that the rest ot the audience had appreciated the
performance as much as I had, and wished to
thank Eric Brown and the choir for a most
enjoyable evening.

Cricket
IC v QMC (ULU Cup)
E L E V E N I N T R E P I D c r i c k e t e r s a n d o n e
bearded W e l s h m a n , t r a v e l l i n g under the
pretence of being an umpire, set out on safari
to Essex. With Flinstone's younger son Bam
Bam at the wheel the boys of the Q M C could
quite reasonably have expected a walkover as
in the first round, when it took Guys over a
day just to find the ground.
However, having arrived at the ground our
driver and c a p t a i n , D Everett, s u r p a s s e d
himself by losing the toss and IC were put in
to bat o n a wicket that resembled a wet
sponge. Our captain not satisfied with losing
the toss opened the batting himself and gave
us the solid start of 7 before being removed
Ibw. The entire IC middle order then followed
their captain's example and IC were reeling at
37 for 7. Then Goddard and Rook came
together and our middle order batsmen were
shown just how to score runs on a absymal
wicket. You use the edge of the bat not the
middle. Q M C fielders were thrown into utter
confusion and allowed IC to scrape 75 off 40
overs with Goddard left on 21 not out.
After a resplendent tea, IC bowlers were
p r e p a r e d a s u s u a l t o m a k e up for the
deficiencies in the batting.
J Thomson arm steaming (at least tepid) in
to bowl the first ball, w h i c h after being
s n i c k e d b y t h e b a t s m a n w a s c a s u a l l y
dropped by, you guessed it, Everett esq. With
the second ball, Thomson infuriated by his
c a p t a i n ' s i n a d e q u a c i e s , had the b a t s m a n
plumb Ibw and the trail of Q M C batsman back
to the pavillion had begun. This trend was
accelerated by the introduction of Slator's
spin bowling? With a combination of long
hops and full tosses Q M C batsmen threw
their wickets away in desperation. Q M C were
all out for 51 and the victorious 1st XI march
on in to the next round of the cup, looking
forward to playing cricket and not water-polo
in the next round.
