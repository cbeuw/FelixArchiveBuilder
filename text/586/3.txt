protects by refusing to sign the
European Convention on Terror-
ism a n d by not e x t r a d i t i n g
terrorists to N Ireland.
T h e r e a l p r o b l e m is t h e
successful propaganda campaign
by the I R A . This is assisted by
the Eire Government's actions
and therefore attracts support
from Americans who have more
money than sense. T h e world's
m e d i a a r e a l s o c o n t i n u a l l y
"getting it w r o n g " . It is time lor
M r s Thatcher a n d M r Adkins to
put the Eire M P s in their place
and pay more attention to the
majority in N Ireland rather than
listening to the whimperings of
Messrs Haughey. Blaney, etc.
Loyalist paramilitaries have
only developed in response to the
G o v e r n m e n t ' s n o n e o m m i t t e d
actions in N Ireland. M r O ' R e i l l y
overlooks the fact that most of the
p a r a m i l i t a r i e s ' a c t i o n s a r e
against Republican sympathisers
and not against the security
forces. But these loyalists are not
well armed and look to Britain to
provide the protection against
the I R A . T h e army are quite
c a p a b l e o f s u p p r e s s i n g t he
terrorists i n N I if they were
allowed todoso by M r s Thatcher's

T o conclude, I must say that I
do not condone any violence in
Ulster from either "side", but it
is up to M r s Thatcher to respect
the view of the majority of people
in N Ireland and to take the
necessary action to dispel any
doubts about N Ireland's position
in the U K . Certain in the N

Dear Sir
I a m r e m i t t i n g this corres-
p o n d e n c e to y o u i n o r d e r to
r e m o n s t r a t e about the recent
apparitions in your publication
with regard to the verbose and
p r e p o s t e r o u s usage, o r m o r e
precisely perhaps, abusage of the
English language as a means of
communication.
I refer in particular, sir. to the
inclusion of a certain Nick Cox's
remittance of two weeks' past, in
w h i c h the g o o d l a d , " d u r i n g
(his) semi-inebriated wanderings
around the ale-houses of South
K e n s i n g t o n " , p r o c e e d e d to
construct an admittedly eloquent
if s o m e w h a t l e n g t h y d i a t r i b e
a p e r t a i n i n g to the e x o r b i t a n t
amounts needlessly expended by
those students who customarily
repair to, a n d / o r reside i n , the
establishment on your premises,
therein referred.. to as "Stan's
Bar".
I wish to register formally my
aversion to the gratuitous misuse
of our often elegant, frequently
expressive language in order to
p u r v e y a m e a n i n g l e s s a n d
ludicrous sentiment.
Tours in anticipation of an improve-
ment of the aforementioned situation,
S E Farrell I F
Sir
It was with great regret that I
handed in my resignation as R C S
President last week. However,
even after the time lapse and an
enormous amount of reflection, I
still come up with the feeling that
my decision was the correct one.
I have always believed that a
President of a U n i o n is there to
represent the students ol the
U n i o n a n d a l s o e q u a l l y as
importantly to take responsibility
for their actions. I still hold that
belief. The reason lor my resigna-
t i o n t h e r e f o r e m u s t i n v o l v e
conflict with those beliefs.
W h e n I first h e a r d of last
week's unsuccessful attempt on
Davy my initial reaction was to
discover who was involved and
discipline them through U n i o n
channels. However I later found
that two members of the Execu-
tive had given their support to
the a t t e m p t . F u r t h e r m o r e a
conscious effort had been made
to not contact me lor fear I may
disapprove.
I fail to see how I can be
expected to represent and be
responsible for an organisation
which shows this contempt ol the
President's views.
It is not the lirst time that lack
of consultation has occurred and
the people involved were well
informed of the feelings expressed
above on the iirst occurrence.
It was w i t h great sadness
therefore, that I was left in the
position where the only option
open to me, if I was to stand by
my beliefs, was to resign.
I w o u l d l i k e to t a k e t h e
opportunity to oiler my sincere
thanks to all those people who
have helped me during the year
and supported me through the
traumatic period and to express
again my deep sadness at having
to take this decision.

employment will arrive this weekend.
Their arrival will be marked by a mass
march and rally starting at 1:00pm
(assemble 12:00 noon) on Sunday
from Speakers Comer in Hyde Park.
(This march will go ahead even if the
Home Secretary bans it)

LAST SUNDAY HAMSOC competed
in the RSGB 144MHz low power
contest, the general idea of the
contest was to work as many stations
as far away as possible. For the
contest we managed to borrow a shed
on the electrical engineering depart-
ment roof, so we felt we had a good
chance of winning since our station
operated close to the upper power
limit (from a good location). In the
event conditions were very poor and
only 170 stations were contacted
during the eight hours of the contest,
however, we managed to make
contacts in eight countries including
most of the near Europeans. It'll be a
few months before the results are
announced but hopefully Imperial
College's callsign will be near the top
of the list. In all. eight members of the
club were involved with a couple of
visitors from other colleges helping
out.

THE COMMITTEE met on Thursday,
May 21.
Our charities for next year are:
National Deaf Children's Society,

great success with over £600 raised.
Next year's committee are Bill
Durodie (Chairman), Matt Smith
(Treasurer), Ronan McDonald (token
transvestite/secretary), Patrick Coll
