Dear Slevie Baby
At Bernard Sunley we were
amused to see the letter from all
those important people in Selkirk
H a l l ( F E L I X 585).
Perhaps some of them want
I C U posts next year?
Note the sentence: " W h i c h is
worth more: the wellbeing of
s t u d e n t s c a t e r e d for by the
s p e c i a l , p e r s o n a l i s e d s o c i a l
environment of these halls, or a
lew thousand pounds in rent?"
W e f i n d t h i s P a s s m o r i a n
d i s r e g a r d for the sanctity of
g r e e n b a c k s v e r y t o u c h i n g ,
especially among people training
for not-very-special, impersonal,
anti-social jobs in industry.
T o preserve their innocence,
we feel it is only fair to oiler them
L u i g i (our warden). W e hardly
ever see him anyway, and when
we do we can't understand a
blind word he says.
We would rather have the few
grand: a) to renovate our slum;
b) to pay off the ^200 plus in lines
which H e r r Tequilla has meted
out in order to make us like him.
Yours in charily

Dear Sir
It is o u r o p i n i o n that the
merging of S e l k i r k / T i z a r d and
K e o g h Falmouth Halls would
destroy their potential to provide
a s u p p o r t i v e a n d s t i m u l a t i n g
environment.
As we see the proposal one
w a r d e n (instead of two) sup-
ported by a subwarden in each
unit will be overseeing nearly 200
students. Inevitably the attention
received by each unit will be
reduced. In return two penthouse
Hats will be available for rent and
six rooms previously allocated as
wardens' places will be available
to students in the normal way.
S u p p o s e d l y less students w i l l
have to commute from home or
live in 'crummy' bedsits. However,
we feel that hall will become a
less desirable place in which to
live.
M a n y aspects of hall life will
suffer a n d we w o u l d l i k e to
outline why they are so valuable
to preserve.
The hall's small size makes it
possible for the warden to know
everybody and to be aware ol
their individual needs as they
respond to the strains of College
life. H e is also readily available lo
advise, being familiar with many
aspects of C o l l e g e — f a r more
than a sub-warden, who being a
s t u d e n t , does not h a v e the
experience.
M a n y social events currently
o r g a n i s e d w i t l i the w a r d e n ' s
g u i d a n c e a n d encouragement
would be impractical lor a large
combined hall. Selkirk not only
organises hall social events but
contributes actively lo College
R a g with a lloat in the R a g
Procession, stalls at the Fete, etc.
Students In a large hall would
certainly feel less committment lo
such ventures. Alternatively, is
the warden to be expected to do
twice the work, with different
a c t i v i t i e s in e a c h u n i t ? W e
suggest one w a r d e n w i l l not
have time to do the hall justice.
M o r e pressure and responsibi-
l i t y c o u l d be p l a c e d on the
subwardens; or will their numbers
be increased, hence reducing the
number of rooms available and
gains in rent.
A hall like Selkirk thrives on
community spirit, where every-
body's part is significant and
involvement is encouraged, be it
in social events or at community
meetings where all residents may
a i r t h e i r views. (At a recent
meeting they voted unanimously
against the proposal to merge the
balls.) The alternative in a large
ball is a representative commit-
tee, and we seen in College as a
whole the dubious success of such
an indirect approach.
Without such an environment,
which we suggest arises Irom a
s m a l l c o m m u n i t y w h e r e the
warden's close involvement is
possible, the quality of life in hall
w i l l p l u m m e t . S o u t h s i d e w i l l
c o n t a i n m e r e l y h o s t e l - t y p e
rooms.
T o subject nearly 400 students
to life in " d e a d " h a l l s al a
College with little enough of a
supportive atmosphere, to save
p e r h a p s 6 s t u d e n t s a d a i l y
j o u r n e y , seems u n j u s t i f i a b l e
madness.

Dear Sir
At a recent U G M , M a y 2G. the
motion discussing the merging ol
T i z a r d and Selkirk Halls was not
held owing to the meeting being
inquorate. I should like to make a
few comments about the way in
which this matter has been dealt
With.
T o a n o n - m e m b e r of the
Student Residence Committee it
appears that the whole issue has
been discussed with a m i n i m u m
of consultation, so as to get the
merger fixed without c a u s i n g
trouble. This caviller attitude is
indefensible, surely those most
experienced in H a l l life should be
given first say in matters which
affect them most directly. O n
Thursday's edition of S T O I C ,
M a r k Clegg (a member of S R C )
c l a i m e d to h a v e c o n s u l t e d
members of Willis Jackson House
about the proposed changes in
H a l l accommodation. W i t h all
respect, lie is failing to do his job
properly if these are the only
people he consults.
In a discussion following the
U G M , both R i c h Archer and
M a r k Clegg said that the views of
students outside H a l l had also to
be considered. I fully except this
viewpoint, however, if the social
life of a H a l l is to be jeopodised in
exchange lor an uncertain gain in
extra places, then surely the
present residents have a useful
role to play in such a decision.
Finally I should just like to ask,
why if the present arrangements
for H a l l work, do they have to be
changed.

Y o u r current campaign against
J o h n Passmore is disgraceful.
Some of the things you have
alleged in it are tantamount to
suggesting that not only is he
I C U President, but that he was
involved in a shady deal concern-
ing rape alarms, he cheated in his
s a b b a t i c a l election c a m p a i g n ,
s q u a n d e r e d £ 5 0 0 of U n i o n
money without a second thought,
he is r e g u l a r l y d r u n k i n the
U n i o n Bar, he's Irish, he's an
ineffectual organ of the Rector's
opinion, he's a lousy president,
and he doesn't deserve a LJGA..
A l l t h e s e c h a r g e s a r e as
unjustified as they are scanda-
lous. M i n d you, I couldn't help

Dear Sieve
Whilst I realise not too many
students will have found the time
to wade through the small print
of last week's supplement, it was
most d i s a p p o i n t i n g to f i n d
neither you, nor one- of your
minions had bothered to do so
either. As I was reading Miss
Lindsay's report I found myself
d i s t r a c t e d by the i n c r e d i b l e
n u m b e r of t y p e s e t t i n g errors.
The other two reports being only
slightly better. This year, F E L I X
has managed to attain a very
high standard in its production
and it is a pity that you have
a l l o o w e d it to slip even this
oneee.

Ed's Note
Dear Ms Wildebeest
D o you not think it unwise for
someone as fat and horrendously
ugly as yourself to dare criticise a
person so unfairly vindictive as
myself?
T o answer your point: I, and
my m i n i o n s , found ourselves
distracted by text so incredibly
b o r i n g that our p r o o f r e a d i n g
efforts were directed to pastures
more pleasant.
Y o u are correct to point out
the high standard of production
maintained in this year's F E L I X
bul I must confess that I was
genuinely surprised that a person
oi such low intelligence would
have noticed. I stand corrected.
H o w e v e r , do n o t t a k e t h e
trouble to write another petty,
nitpicking letter to this organ
again—unless you want me to
print a picture ol you with no
panties on. that is! Furthermore,
how dare you be so presumptions
as to address me by my Christian
name. What's wrong with " S i r " ?
Dear Sir
I was quite annoyed to read
M r G O'Reilly's letter in last
week's F E L I X in which he refers
to the "legitimate desire of the
Irish people for a united coun-
try". H e must mean the desire of
the Eire Government because he
appears to be totally unaware of
the fact that a large majority of
people in Northern Ireland wish
to remain part of the U K . It is
u n l o r t u n a t e the views of the
Unionist politicians are not as
w e l l p u b l i c i s e d as t h o s e of
Republican criminals. Despite
some rash behaviour (blown up
out of al! proportions by the
media), the Rev Ian Paisley has
attempted to express the concern
of the Ulster people but has time
and time again been represented
by the media as an extremist. H e
is trying to make M r s Thatcher
aware of the Southern Govern-
m e n t d e s p i t e a n y t h i n g M r
Haughey may say at summit
talks.
