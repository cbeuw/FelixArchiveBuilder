Monro: "I haven't had a woman in Weeks"
A shock move was revealed last night, just before FELIX hit
the presses - D r D M Q Monro, Senior Warden and warden of
Weeks, astounded friends and acquaintances by turning up to
conduct an opera dressed as a woman!
It is suspected that the move is just part of Dr Monro's master
plan to increase the number of females in hall.
Don had hoped to elope with an unnamed female member of
the orchestra, whom he refers to as "my A-registration
redhead." In an interview with FELIX, the young lady expressed
her relief at the news. "I hope Don will be very happy in his new
life," she said.
Royalty!
O N W E D N E S D A Y afternoon
crowds of policemen and general
populace crammed Exhibition
R o a d a n d C r o m w e l l R o a d ,
t r y i n g to c a t c h a p r c - r o y a l
wedding glimpse ol the Queen,
w h o was m a k i n g an a l m o s t
unheralded visit to the National
History M u s e u m . The cheering
crowds of loyal IC students were
conspicuous by their absence.
It could be Her Majesty's last
visit to the building in its current
Ibrm, as there is a controversial
p l a n to d e m o l i s h the eastern
galleries and to erect a £l(>m ' ' v e
storey block.
Yacht sold!
I M P E T U S , the IC yacht has
been sold. It had a history of
unmitigated disaster. W h e n it
was bought several years ago it
was found to be defective and it
took six months for the repairs to
be c o m p l e t e d . Y a c h t C l u b
managed to run it aground in
July 1979 (the rudder fell off) and
the I nion has been paying for its
mooring at Gosport ever since. A
survey discovered myriad faults
and so it was put up for sale
through a broker, and it's now
been purchased for £4,35Q by a
private buyer.
AGM INQUORATE!
Last Tuesday ICU's Annual General Meeting was held in Mech
Eng 220. The meeting will probably be remembered for the
large amount of time spent on procedural wrangles.
The meeting opened at 1:10pm with about 250 people present. J o n
Firth took the Chair, and whilst the meeting was discussing the
minutes of the last meeting, a procedural motion was moved to change
the ordet of business, to consider a motion on Southside Halls next. J o n
Firth refused to accept the procedural motion, but his ruling was
challenged. J o h n Passmore ( I C U President) took the Chair, whilst the
challenge to the Chairman's ruling was discussed. The challenge was
defeated on a vote, so the order of business was left unchanged.
J o h n Passmore then gave his annual report. H e was questioned on
the increases in residence fees. M r W i l l i a m Cortazzi was particularly
interested to know what part of the 12% increase was for " C a p i t a l
Replacement" and it transpired that the increase might be 8% if a
College deal to buy a hall of residence fell through.
After the President's report was accepted, a procedural motion was
moved to consider the motions on S C C finances and Southside next.
J o n Firth refused to accept it, so the meeting went through the
rigmarole of a challenge to the Chairman's ruling. This was carried on
a hand count. However, M r D u n c a n Suss ( F E L I X Editor, 1977/8)
asked that the last vote be retaken on a show of Unioncards (at which
Mr Suss subsequently successfully voted with his Accesscard-Ed.). This vote
was counted, and the challenge to the Chairman's ruling upheld.
The meeting continued to discuss the procedural motion to consider
two motions next. This was passed. Immediately another change to the
order ol business to consider the Byelaw changes next was proposed.
This was carried on the vote. L i z Lindsay then moved that the colours
to stall be awarded next, and this was carried. Those receiving colours
included Prof Sutton Pro-Rector, J o h n Smith College Secretary,
A r t h u r Turner Financial Secretary (who was also awarded U n i o n Life
membership), M a l c o l m Aldridge Financial Assistant, M a r t i n Parsons
Refectory, T o m C o t t r e l l , N a t West Bank Liason Officer, Dave
Burtenmaster Estates, Sue Telling Welfare Assitant, M a z Fellows
F E L I X p h o t o t y p e s e t t e r o p e r a t o r , C a r o l i n e W a i t t N i g h t l i n e
Coordinator, I Thomas Domestic Manager, D r K e n Weale U n i o n
Senior Treasurer, J e n H a r d y - S m i t h U n i o n Administrator and Pat
Baker U n i o n typist.
Annie Laethean was given a U G A for her work for the Union.
U G A s were also presented to L i l Lindsay and M s Snee. As L i z Lindsay
was about to present a U G A to J o h n Passmore, W i l l i a m Cortazzi
moved an emergency motion to prevent all three Executive members
from receiving U G A s , but this was not accepted.
Byelaw changes were then discussed. The first extended the grounds
for life membership of the U n i o n , the second abolished I C W A , and the
third put the Entertainments C h a i r m a n on U n i o n Council. These were
all passed, and will now go to the Governing Body for approval.
The S C C grant claim motion was discussed. This was passed and the
U G M instructed U F C ( U n i o n F i n a n c e Committee) to add the
subscriptions back to S C C ' s grant claim. T h e subscription had
previously been deleted by U F C .
A t this point Gordon Quartey successfully challenged the quorum,
so the A G M closed due to inquoracy just after 2:00pm.
The reports ol the Deputy President, H o n Sec, Returning O i l i ( e r
and other officers were not discussed. Thus, the Dep Rep elections and
elections at the last U G M still have to be ratified. The reports will be
brought up again at the first U G M of next session. (Will this he another
ICWA, tossed from inquorate UGM to inquorale ('CM with gay
abandon?-Ed.)
