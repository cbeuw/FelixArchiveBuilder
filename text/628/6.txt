[OPINION I
Exposing
the Nazi-Zionist
Connection
— A Jewish Viewpoint
Are the Israelis the new Nazis? This is the clear question behind last
week's article 'The Palestinian Holocaust'p Use of the phrases
'holocaust', 'genocide' and 'concentration camps in the Second World
War' combine to create the impression that driven by 'the Zionist aim
to create an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine' the Israelis are
mercilessly butchering the Palestinian people.
Menachem Begin has used the article are trying to imply that
Holocaust to justify some of his
actions over the years, much to
the horror of those Jews and
non-Jews who wish to see the
memory of that unimaginable
period preserved as accurately as
possible, as a warning for future
generations. Right wing revision-
ist historians, in a far more
extreme manner, have taken a
cavalier attitude to the facts of
the Holocaust, maintaining that
Hitler did not know about the
murder of the Jews and that in
any case six million Jews were
not really killed. T h i s vile
nonsense is publicised by the
National Front and other similar
groups.
Now, alas, it would appear
that the H o l o c a u s t is to be
abused for political purposes yet
again, in the way in which last
week's article cynically over-
states what could have been a
perfectly legitimate case.
The Israelis are not running a
'concentration camp' in Southern
Lebanon. Even if the Israelis
were torturing every Palestinian
in this camp (and there is not a
shred of evidence to support
such a ridiculous claim) it is hard
to imagine that they are gassing
Palestinians, turning their bodies
into candles or p e r f o r m i n g
atrocious medical experiments
on them, to mention but a few of
the more notable crimes com-
mitted by the Nazis.
The 'genocide at Sabra and
Chetila' was a terrible blot on
the record of all involved and an
appalling human tragedy. But
'genocide' means the destruction
of an entire people which it was
not. Again the word 'holocaust'
is totally unreasonable in the
context, vastly overstating in its
implications, the actual events in
Lebanon (bad as they were).
It seems to the Jewish Society
that the use of these emotive
expressions and the tone of the
Zionism is Nazism, an intensely
offensive accusation to Jews,
and to anybody with an aware-
ness of the past forty years of
history.
Peace Now
The sad part of this article is that
much valid (and much invalid)
criticism of Israel has appeared
recently in the Western Press
(and in the Israeli press) and
these points alone would be
quite sufficient to establish that
the Palestinians have suffered
recently in Lebanon and will
continue to suffer as refugees
until some resolution to the
conflict in the Middle East is
found.
The article mentioned with
praise the Peace Now movement
in Israel who have (and continue)
to speak openly for Palestinian
rights and an eventual solution
b a s e d o n the p a r t i t i o n o f
Israel/Palestine. H o w e v e r ,
Peace Now are also Zionists and
even the most moderate Peace
Now members would find it
hard to sit down and talk with
an extremist who claims that
Zionists are no better than
Nazis.
The other side of the lack of
objectivity of the article was the
whitewashing of the P L O ' s
attitude towards Israel over the
years. Under the subtitle ' P L O
peacemakers' we were told that
"the PLO...has always sought
towards finding a peaceful
solution to the conflict." When
Yasser Arafat spoke to the
United Nations it is true that he
held an olive branch in one
hand. He held a submachine gun
in the other.
More importantly, the coven-
ant of the P L O calls explicitly
for the destruction of the State
of Israel and replacing it by a
"secular, democratic" Palestine.
T o achieve this it calls for
" a r m e d s t r u g g l e " a n d the
expulsion of the Zionist settlers
(ie Israeli Jews from, presumably,
1897). This is not a peaceful,
diplomatic approach.
It would have been argued that
terrorism has been necessary for
the Palestinians to make their

voice h e a r d ; h o w e v e r , last
week's article attempts to deny
any but peaceful actions to the
P L O , once again indulging in a
completely pointless hiding of
the truth.
Mutual
Recognition
The official policy of Imperial
College Jewish Society, along
with the U n i o n o f J e w i s h
Students to which it is affiliated,
is mutual recognition of Jewish
and Palestinian rights, and that
any future settlement should be
on the basis of this fundamentally
important recognition. At the
formation of the IC Friends of
Palestine Society the suggestion
was made by the Jewish Society
that it may be possible to find
common ground based on one
policy, towards putting forward
a joint motion on Israel/Palestine
theory in the Union (an event
which in a small way would
make history!). This was due to
the very reasonable speeches
given by some members of the
Palestine Society—implicitly
recognising the right of Israel to
exist and calling essentially for a
Palestinian State on the West
Bank and Gaza (yes, this is also
Peace Now policy). We chose to
set aside as atypical a disturbing
speech of solidarity by a member
of the Islamic Society, calling for
the Jews to pack up their bags
and leave Israel " i n peace",
before they are thrown out
"harshly", by force.
We are now publicly repeating
this offer to the F r i e n d s of
Palestine Society with that
warning that if the extremism so
blatantly shown in last weeks
article is the true mark of the
society any communication will
have to cease. Comparison of
the Nazi Holocaust to the recent
events in Lebanon is just as
offensive to Jews as the rantings
of the lunatic right wing on the
same subject. If there is to be a
dialogue between Jews and
Palestinians (and between Israel
and the P L O in the long term)
this must be on the basis of
mutual understanding of the
feelings of each side. C o n -
sequently, it would be very
welcome if the leaders of the
Friends of Palestine Society
would be prepared to publicly
disassociate themselves from the
disgraceful comparisons in their
(anonymous!) article, and we
challenge them to do so.
