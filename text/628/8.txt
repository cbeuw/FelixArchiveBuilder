Heaven 0
Armaments 1
Major Barbara by Bernard Shaw.
Directed by Peter Gill. The Cottesloe,
National Theatre.
Major Barbara is one of three plays by
which Shaw converted the theatre into a
forum of ideas and debate, where audiences
came to be provoked and to be forced to
think. The theme in the play is poverty, and
what could or should be done about it. The
argument is fought between Undershaft, the
world's greatest armaments manufacturer
(played by Brewster Mason), and his daughter
Barbara, a major in the Salvation Army (played
by Penelope Wilton). The play was written in
1905, at a time when Britain was at the summit
of her Imperial power and was the world's
second biggest armaments exporter, and also,
at a time when it was claimed that one person
in ten 'lived below the standard of the London
cab-horse'. Major Barbara appears today to
have lost none of its relevance. A frighteningly
large proportion of Britain's population lives on
or below the officially designated poverty line,
and this at a time when the Government is
spending more on defence than any other
country in Europe, and is still selling upwards
of £700m w o r t h of armaments a year in
secrecy to various governments throughout
the world.
The play holds interest at the very outset.
Shaw was a vociferous atheist, and an equally
vociferous socialist. Would he come down on
the side of the Salvation A r m y and the
Kingdom of Heaven, or on the side of the seller
of arms (called The Prince of Darkness by his
family)?
Undershaft wins, but not easily and not
clearly. The argument is conducted as the
Undershaft family is led around the factory,
and S h a w argues equally eloquently and
cleverly for each side. Undershaft claims that
poverty is a crime, and the high wages and
organised welfare arrangements with which he
saves his workers from the degradation of
p o v e r t y c o n t r a s t f a v o u r a b l y w i t h his
daughter's modest charitable rations to the
down-and-outs in the Salvation Army's hostel.
But Undershaft's philosophy extends further.
He firmly upholds the armourer's faith: 'to give
arms to all men who offer an honest price for
t h e m , w i t h o u t r e s p e c t of p e r s o n s or
principles'. He abhors politicians and others
who classify, label and even condemn large
sections of the world's populace. Who has a
right to pass judgements of this kind, and on
what basis?
The argument, as may be expected, covers
a great many other issues. However, the usual
Shavian silliness pervades the play like a
lingering farmyard smell: the rapacious lady of
the family, played by Sian Phillips, is a Lady
Britomart; the great Undershaft enterprise
must always be inherited by a foundling;
B a r b a r a ' s sweetheart (played by N i c h o l a s
Jones) who takes on the enterprise at the end
of the play, is a Professor of Greek; and the
embarrassing member of the family, Charles
Lomax (played by mark Tandy), wallows in
insouciant verbal laziness and exclaims " O h , I
say!" all the time. All very silly.
This is a good production of Major Barbara,
but I fear the pace is rather fast towards the
end and it becomes a job to keep up. The play
is certainly much better than Jonathan Lyon's
recent production of Shaw's Arms and the
Man at the Lyric Theatre, and The Dark Lady
of the Sonnets and The Admirable Bashville at
the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park last
summer. The N T production is recommended
for lovers of Shaw and anyone who likes a
good argument.

Worth Missing
A Meal For?
D i a r y of a H u n g e r S t r i k e by P e t e r
Sheridan, directed by Pam Brighton, Hull
Truck Theatre Company at the Round
House.
As the title suggests this play examines the
complicated issues of the recent H-Block
hunger strike. The production was not too
biased towards the IRA cause (though some
would say it was biased merely because the
subject was presented at all). The approach
was that of a diary, with both warder and
i n m a t e e x p r e s s i n g t h e i r e m o t i o n s a n d
opinions. The arguments from both sides of
the Northern Ireland dispute were offered, so
whilst there was nothing new in them, at least
it provided an education for the apparently all-
American audience which surrounded me.
The most important point which appeared in
the play was the lack of interest in N Ireland
shown by the British. This was shown by the
naivety of the Tory peer played by James W y n
(which reflected that of the newly-elected Mrs
WALKABOUT-
lOOKStt
by Mobile Optics Inc.
Thatcher, who thought she could solve the
problems of the Province in a few months).
S e c o n d l y , the p r o t e s t a n t p r i s o n w a r d e r
(Christopher Whitehouse) who recognised
that the British consider Ulstermen to be Irish
whilst Irishmen regard them as 'Brits'. Finally,
this British lack of interest is illustrated by the
replacement warder (Alan Buckingham) who
is English right down to the London accent and
talks only of Spurs Football Club while the rest
of the prison is experiencing the tension of the
imminent death of a hunger striker.
The moral of this review is 'don't sweep
Northern Ireland under your carpet'. Get over
to the Round House before December 4.

Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat,
Kindly put a penny in the old man's hat;
If you haven't a penny, a ha'penny will do,
If you haven't got a ha'penny then got bless
you.
E c h o i n g the spirit of trad anon a b o v e ,
though not the scansion, Walkabout took me
along Brompton Road towards Knightsbridge:
Christmas is coming, chestnuts are being
roasted on the pavement, the windows at
Harrods are full of be-ribboned, be-baubled
Christmas trees and the facade is festively
outlined by a seemingly-endless string of light
bulbs. Before you get thoroughly bored with
the concept of Christmas 1982, and before
your grant runs out completely, visit Harrods
and enjoy the ultimate commercial Xmas.
In 1849 H e n r y C h a r l e s H a r r o d , a tea
merchant, took over a small grocery shop in
M i d d l e Queen's Building (now B r o m p t o n
Road): he had a turnover of £20 a week and
employed two assistants. Following the Great
Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park, Knightsbridge
grew from an area infamous for its highway
robberies, to a fashionable district. Harrod's
business prospered, expanded, and has never
looked back.
The first escalator in a London store was
installed in Harrods, in 1898. In July 1981, a
new bank of escalators was opened on the
west side of the store. They are faced in
Roman travertine marble and incorporate a
waterfall from the first to the ground floor!
C u r r e n t l y , w o r k is in p r o g r e s s on the
escalators on the cast side: you can ride up on
copper-coloured tradition, and down on silver-
grey modernity.

The ' A r t Reflections' gallery, next to the
Georgian Restaurant on the fourth floor, offers
a short excusion into the visual arts. The

exhibition of Limited Edition reproductins and
objets d'art, and also a collection of original
Eskimo (Inuit) sculpture.

smoothly polished, and their clear, streamlined
shapes have a class simplicity and beauty. The
sculptor's aim is to release the spirit contained
in each piece of stone; and between them,
sculptor and spirit produce the likeness of a
seal, bear, or whatever. The beauty of the
piece appears to be incidental, as there is no
word 'beautiful' in the Inuit language.
Harrods Limited
"Harrods must be a showpiece which attracts
visitors from both home and overseas, not
only as a trading store, but as a supremely
different place of interest...(the) wide range of
high quality merchandise must always be seen
to be good value for money, t a k i n g into
account the atmosphere and style of Harrods*

statement of policy, which explains the store's
objectives and its raison d'etre. They are
aiming at discriminating customers, whatever
their social class. So, as you roll your eyes at
the price of a tin of dry-roast peanuts,
remember that you are paying in part for the
plushy, stylish decor (where else does meat
Hall have a preservation order on it because of
its original Victorian tile friezes?), for the
helpful (...well usually, avoid over-crowded
Saturday afternoons) staff, for the free delivery
within a thirty mile radius, etc, etc.
Harrods is on the flashy side of smart: their
razzmatazz approach is undeniable, neverthe-
less Christmas at Harrods is extravagantly and
childishly fun. D a r t h V a d e r will make a
personal appearance in the Toy Fair, on the
third floor, on N o v e m b e r 20, a n d F a t h e r
Christmas will arrive there on November 27
and stay till Christmas Eve.
In the Food Halls, on the ground floor,
Harrods are presenting a range of Christmas
gift boxes, brimming with fine food and wine.
The 'Supreme' (the hamper of a liftetime,
£1,000!) is stuffed with every conceivable
Christmas goody, from a gallon of Glenfiddich
w h i s k y , t h r o u g h m u l t i c o l o u r e d S o b r a n i e
cocktail cigarettes, to a storage jar of Harrods
Brandy Butter. If you're not that greedy, or not
that wealthy, but still looking for something a
little special to take home, you'll find delicious,
pure butter Harrods shortbread in the Bakery
(ground floor). Petticoat Tails (400g) and
Shortbread Fingers (500g) come in pretty,
round and oblong tins respectively, at £1.95
each.
