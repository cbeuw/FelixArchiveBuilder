Guilds'
Show
Last Saturday was the annual
Lord Mayor's or Guilds Show,
and as usual Guilds had a float
in it. This year, however, they
had to have a float with the
Operation Drake Fellowship
because o f ' d y i n g student
participation'. In fact Guilds
were the only student float left in
the show, since Barts and City
were cast out completely, which
peeved two City students who
appeared at the start.
The spirit of the occasion was
consistently high, with Booma-
lakas for the Lord Mayor, the
cameras, the little girl on her
daddy's shoulders who wasn't
smiling
Centipede
Assalted
Social activities in Selkirk Hall
will suffer as a consequence of
vandalism carried out in the
early hours of Saturday morning.
A large quantity of salt was
poured into the Centipede video
game and one of the telephones,
and costs of repair have been
considerable. The profit sharing
scheme which Selkirk has with
the owners of the games mach-
ines enables social events to be
subsidised. The cost of repairs
has had to come from Selkirk's
share of the profit and Warden
Henry Hutchinson has pointed
out that the entire Hall will be
hit by the action of a few
irresponsible people.
Where Were
They?
Only two of the College's twelve
departmental representatives
turned up to Monday's Council
meeting, which was declared
inquorate from the start. This
will probably assist the move to
remove Dep Reps from Council.
Of the Council's forty-odd
members, less than half turned
up, and John Passmore objected
to the meeting being opened
without a quorum—much to the ,
annonyance of those who had
turned up in the hope of getting
through a great deal of Union
business. T h e meeting was
adjourned, and Council Chair-
man Nick Pyne has sent out
memos informing councillors of

The car they did it in
Vive Le Beaujolais!
Driving a Rover 2300S loaned by
B L three members of the City &
Guilds College Motor Club raced
across France to a very creditable
twelfth place overall on the
Beaujoiais Rally earlier this week.
The Beaujolais Rally which
celebrates the release of the
Beaujolais N o u v e a u wine is
primarily a distance event where
the car covering the shortest
mileage between a vineyard in
Villefranche (near Lyons) and
Brighton wins. However, an
important condition is that all
competitors must catch the
8:00am ferry from Boulogne to
D o v e r or be excluded. T h i s
means that an average of at least
45mph must be maintained.
The crew, Chris Millard, John
Vedy and Martin Kift, set off
along with 124 other competitors
from the vineyard on Sunday
complete with ten cases of
Beaujolais Nouveau. Because
they knew that their route would
entail driving down slower
twisty country lanes as they
skirted Paris, a high speed stint
up the A6 autoroute to Ausceme
was essential. Unfortunately this
was nearly thwarted by dense
traffic on the autoroute and time
was wasted queueing at tollgates
however as they steamed further
north the road cleared and a
steady llOmph was maintained
to the fuel stop at Sens.
After refuelling and a change
of driver and navigator the
Rover continued to make good
time partially due to a total
disregard of French road traffic
laws and eventually easily made
the ferry, beating all the Porches
and Ferraris.
The British stint was supposed
to be fairly leisurely, but delays
at customs put the schedule back
and again a high speed sprint
was necessary—the car arriving
at the finish with only two
minutes to spare.
The crew, who hope to raise
money for the mentally handi-
capped by selling the wine
brought back, also came second
in the charity class.
policy that Council members
who miss two successive meet-
ings without sending apologies
are deemed to have resigned.
The meeting has been re-
arranged for next Monday.
Telephones
Exchanged
Many telephone calls on the
college switchboard were cut off
yesterday afternoon. This is
because Kensington exchange is
preparing to transfer to a new
computer system next Thursday,
and the problems are likely to
continue until then.
Asbestos Tiles
A S T M S Union members have
refused to work in part of the
Mines Building in the belief that
damaged asbestos tiles may
constitute a health risk.
The suspended ceiling-tiles in
some rooms of the Geology
department have suffered from
leaking water-pipes, and some
are now efflorescing (that is,
shedding asbestos dust). N o n -
academic staff have become
increasingly concerned, a n d
after a television documentary
on asbestos-related diseases in
industry, their Union withdrew
their services from the affected
areas. They stressed that this was
not a strike and that they would
continue to work in other parts
of the building. Their action will
have its greatest effect o n
industrial research work, which
is a major source of revenue to
the College.
Professor K n i l l , H e a d of
Department and Dean of the
Royal School of Mines, told
F E L I X that there is no question
of a dispute between the depart-
ment and the A S T M S ; on the
contrary, the department is
doing everything in its power to
resolve the matter. The Estates
Department, he said, has taken a
most responsible attitude to the
affair, and that expenditure has
been authorised for the work to
be carried out.
Doctor Hargreaves, the Col-
lege Safety Director, said that
independent surveys have been
carried out and levels of asbestos
dust in the air were found to be
well below the permitted level.
The Mines Building was erected
well before the restrictions on
the use of asbestos were imple-
mented in 1969, but there is no
question of danger from un-
damaged tiles, and many tiles
with a similar appearance have
no asbestos content at all.
Sunday Times attacks Tebbit
Hugo Young, the political editor
of the Sunday Times, attacked
the Conservative Party for being
able to consider Norman Tebbit
as a potential leader.

said that only five years ago M r
Tebbit would not have been
taken seriously, yet he was the
star of this year's party confer-
ence. He described M r Tebbit as
an unpleasantly rascist and anti-
union politician who expresses
views which the rank and file of
his party has held shamefacedly
for many years. But now that
B r i t i s h p o l i t i c s is t e n d i n g
towards extremes, he claimed
that the Conservative Party had
discarded all social conscience.
