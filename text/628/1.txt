CHELSEA TO BE
PENSIONED OFF?
Professor Randolph Quirk, Vice-Chancellor of the University of London
has been attending a series of meetings at Chelsea this week with the
aim of writing a draft proposal of intent to merge the college in
accordance with the SARC Report. This is a plan to concentrate the
science departments of the University onfivesites: Imperial, University
College, Kings/QEC, Queen Mary College and the recently merged
Bedford/Royal Holloway College.
In a Union General Meeting
yesterday, Chelsea students
voted unanimously to oppose all
mergers and cuts, but they have
been told that if they do not
merge, their grant allocation
from the University of London
will be cut further still. Already,
they have been forced to close
their two non-scientific depart-
ments (Humanities and Social
Studies) and they have been
instructed to cut academic staff
by a third before next year.
The proposed merger follows
only months after Kings and
Q E C merged—this time last
year, moves were afoot to join
Q E C with Imperial—and is the
third such scheme since the
S A R C reports. Chelsea is in
much the same position as
Bedford College, which had to
close its internationally recog-
nised classics department and
form a split-site college with
Royal Holloway thirty miles
away in Egham.
C h e l s e a Students U n i o n
representatives have said that
even if they are forced to merge,
they will refuse to operate a
s p l i t - s i t e s y s t e m l i k e that
operating at Q E C , where stu-
dents travel from Notting Hill to
the Strand four times per week
by bus. Although they have been
assured that academic standards
will not fall, they are skeptical as
their staff/student ratio is being
cut.
Following Wednesday's dem-
onstration in the Kings Road in
support o f the N U S grants
campaign, during which a road
was blocked, Chelsea Union
Executive is confident that it has
enough activists to make their
opposition heard.
Chain
Letters
Hit IC
An outbreak of chain letters is
sweeping through Imperial
College. As many as five hundred
students are believed to have
taken part; some claim to have
made up to £1,000 but most may
expect to lose out on the deal.
The letters, which are believed
to have originated in Dorset and
come into the College through
the Geology Department, pro-
mise a return of up to £164,000
for a short-term loan of £40 and
operate within a system known
as the 'Gold Circle'. The pro-
cedure is as follows: you buy a
list of twelve names from a
friend for £20. You then (in the
presence of your trusted friend)
post £20 to the person whose
name and address is at the top of
the list, and copy the list out
twice, moving each name up one
place on the 'ladder'; removing
the name at the top and putting
your name at number twelve,
you then sell your lists to two
people for £20 each, recovering
the money that you have spent.
The theory is that after a
further twelve stages of the
operation, there will be 21 2
lists
with your name at the top, and
from each of these you will
receive £20—a total of £80,780.
The system breaks down
because the money has to come
from somewhere. After twenty
steps, about a million people
have lists, and have to sell them
on what is now a saturated
market. A further step merely
doubles the number of people
trying to sell the lists. The 'Gold
Circle' system has certainly been
through that many steps already,
and a letter has been received
from the University of London
Union advising people not to
buy the letters.
The covering letter provided
with the chain letter is remark-
ably insidious, in that it encour-

A Load
Of Bull
At last Thursday's U G M the
R C S were p r o u d l y able to
present 'Velish', the fearsome
head of an Aberdeen Angus bull.
This fine specimen was, as
reported last week, the mascot
removed from the School of
Slavonic and East European
Studies (SSEES) with no greater
opposition than the cries of a
marauding tea lady.
In return for the return of
their mascot, the SSEES have
agreed to provide sufficient
enthusiastic volunteers to be
able to raise a minimum of £50
for the R C S Rag collection on
Saturday.
