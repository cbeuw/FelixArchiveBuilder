IC vs U C II 3-2
Sunday evening in the bath
seems a good time to look back
on a day when IC 2 overcame
the auld enemy as well as the
administrative cock-ups of their
own club. A day when, the VIIs
went to play at Merton, when
they should have been at Har-
lington, no referees were ar-
ranged, the opposition were left
at the Union as no-one knew
they were coming on our coach,
and Steve Jomo Rimmer proved
small folk can beat defenders in
the air but only when the ball's
two feet off the ground!
After a hectic start, the IC
defence were put under a lot of
pressure and B u r n s , B e r n s ,
Powell and T o n y (last name
unknown) did well to hold out
the IC attack of Coussens, Rigby
and Rimmer woke up soon after
and Rimmer it was who made
the net bulge for IC's first. H T 1-
0.
U C could have been finished
off within two minutes of the
start but alas, they regained their
composure and a minor, ahem,
mistake left Mike Hardy picking
the ball out of the net instead of
from between his feet.
After a period of toing and
froing Dave Hardy, who had
been combing well in midfield
with Gaskill and Buckley, just
dashed off on his own and
scored, so much for a patient
build-up. U C , however, came
back again and bucked it up at
2-2.
And then, with only a few
minutes remaining, Berns float-
ed the ball back into the box and
the Gnome stooped low (why
didn't he just kick it) to head
home the winner and send B B J
into a two minute celebratory
dance routine, after which, Andy
the s n o o k e r player t u r n e d
referee blew for full-time.
Volleyball
This season is beginning to
resemble a repeat of last year,
with I C V B C first team winning
its first three S E E T E C H League
matches in straight sets. So far
W a t f o r d , S o u t h B a n k and
Middlesex Polys have fallen
victim to Pete Walker's spikes,
Christo's sneaky short balls, and
M a n s generally dirty tricks.
W i t h H a i r y C h r i s t o d p o u l o u
setting the cultural tone of the
team, newcomers like M i k e
J a m e s must be w o n d e r i n g
whether the IC prospectus told
the whole t r u t h . O n l y the
captain (author of this fiction),
in his dashing cherrypickers and
moustache, shows modest pro-
mise, though well disguised,
beneath mumbled obscenities.
Of 'Falling Francois' Grey the
less said the better.
On to the second team then.
As yet unblooded, led by the
abovementioned Francois, they
will shortly be playing the
G e r m a n S c h o o l , the F r e n c h
Lycee, and possibly the Wimble-
don Y M C A . Plenty of promise
amongst the newcomers, with a
bit of luck and some coordina-
tion they should do well.
Mustn't forget to mention the
ladies, either, who will soon be
playing various friendly matches
for the experience. A n y b o d y
interested (preferably female)
please contact Nada el-Yassir
LS2, or just come around to a
ladies training evening (Tues-
days 1730-1900h at the Volley-
ball Court, behind Biochem-
istry).
We also train Wednesday and
Saturday afternoons (1330 till
about 1700h).
Team: P Dias-Lalcaca (capt),
P Walker, N El-Yassir, A Green,
F Grey, A Knap, C Christou, M
Lam, H Christodoulou, M James,
S Lauria (baggage attendant!).

Score (Liverpool Street 7:00am):
IC vs C & G Carnival 4-2
Peter, obviously being too hung
over, didn't even master the BR
tannoy at Ipswich—perhaps
N o v a c o u l d give him some
lessons.
Despite crys of 'Water', 'Mast
abeam', and 'I've got to get my
leg over' from the U E A ladies,
we scored a win against them.
T h e i r mens team, however,
would not succombe to our
charms (where was Peter?) and
we were convincingly defeated in
both races against them in spite
of the supreme efforts of Dawdler
Dalton and Back-of-the-Fleet
Bennett, the latter being unable
to resist his annual dip in Oulton
Broads.
The second round was ar-
ranged at the W h e n y I n n ,
followed by a lightening drive
back to Norwich to catch the last
train.
This posed two questions: why
do U E A have mattresses in the
back of their vans? And where
was Peter when we needed him
most?
Team: Julian Bennett, Graham
Dalton, Graham Kennedy, Nora
Myers, JameS Redman, Richard
Tostevin, Peter Howarth (apolo-
gies).
At the Harp: Sailing continues
throughout the winter every
Wednesday afternoon with food
and cheap beer in the evenings.
Peter will be there.
Judo
Well here it is, what you've all
been waiting for, the first judo
article of the academic year. O K ,
so I exaggerate, but here's the
important bit.
Gradings: Congratulations to
K e i t h and T e r r y who both
picked up points at their first
Dan gradings. Keith got 10 and
Terry 17.
Also congratulations to me
and Andy P. I graded to 6th Kyu
and Andy to 8th.
Forthcoming events: IC have
in their possession a nice shiny
trophy, which unfortunately
London Medical College want.
So to be fair we have to fight
them for it. This will take place
on November 30 at IC.
Our team consists of Martin,
Terry, Tim, Keith and Mark.
Bye for now.
Fencing
Our second match of the season
against U C L and it c o u l d
scarcely have been more different
from the first. In fact, it was so
very different that it was almost
a mirror image, with instead of
the ladies and novices teams
winning, only the ladies team
lost (the novices did not fence).
Indeed, this match saw an
altogether changed outlook
f r o m the male teams. T h e
sabreurs won 8-1, the foil teams
A and B won 5-4 each, and the
epee (the greatest change of all,
from losing 1-8) won 6-3.
Thus, it was an altogether
more pleasing match (bar the
ladies, poor dears), one which
leaves us looking forward to the
next.
Basketball
IC vs Ealing College 75-106
For the opening match of the
season the court was packed by a
capacity crowd. Both of them
were visibly excited by the
i prospect of this match between
two giants of the L o n d o n
Colleges Basketball League.
The match tipped off at 7:30
and by 7:37 IC's fate was sealed
as Ealing amassed an early 20
point lead. (Mainly as the IC
team was having forty winks
recovering from a two hour
warm-up!).
When awake the team fought
like tigers, matching E a l i n g
basket for basket, losing teeth in
the process (Tamman was the
unfortunate victim).
Generally a mediocre team
p e r f o r m a n c e a n d G e o r g e ' s
contribution of a mere thirty
points did little to help our
situation!
Team: Brian, Nick, George,
Alan, Tamman, Andy, Ian, Ken,
John and Tim.
Boat
Last Saturday three fours from
Imperial College took part in the.
Head of the River Fours Race.
Although starting in the new
entries at the back of the field all
crews rowed exceptionally well
to finish well up in the order.
The two coxless fours (IC I and
II) were within four seconds of
each other finishing 28th and
24th respectively out of about
330 crews. In doing this they
beat two crews from U L and
came within five seconds of the
fastest National Lightweight
four. T h e coxed four I C 3
f i n i s h e d 45th, o n l y fifteen
seconds behind our coxless
boats, and beating equivalent
college opposition convincingly.
The crews were: T Anderson,
P Allen, P McConnell, B Down-
ing (IC I); J Thorp, W Bradbury,
J O'Brien, P Edwards (IC II); J
Griffiths, G Harding, E Mendez,
M Greaves (IC III).

Mixed
IC vs U C 1-8
The mixed First team rumbled
into action last Wednesday. The
club captain decided it was time
to make a guest appearance. In
retrospect this turned out to be
not such a good idea!
Ian and Jo played as well as
can be expected without Jaffa
cakes. Dominic and Jane played
very well but to no a v a i l .
Dominic seemed to be arguing
with himself for a lot of the time.
The club captain wishes he
hadn't played!
