ICLUBS & SOCIETIES!
RSM
I hope everyone enjoyed their day down in
Cardiff and it was good to see that we taught
them a bit about singing songs and boat races
(to the extent they had to start cheating!).
Thanks very much to everyone who helped
out at the O p e n Day. The students who
attended all s e e m e d to think it was well
worthwhile.
Names are now being taken for the Mines
Ball (Dec 17). Tickets are £28 (for a double)
and although that might sound expensive it
includes a four course meal, cabaret, disco and
bars. W e will accept post-dated cheques (till
next term) so get your name down to the
Union Office now.
I suppose there are not many of you out there
who are aware that the R S M possesses a
motorised mascot, but let me assure you that
Clementine, a 1926 Morris Commercial, is
very much alive.
C l e m is at present being rebuilt, having been
rolled (yes, rolled!) some years ago. At that
time, C l e m was stripped, chucked into boxes,
and distributed all over College for restoration
work.
Unfortunately, nobody bothered to record
where all the pieces went, and we have been
left with the frustration of a jigsaw, with
numerous unaccountable missing pieces.
Please, if anybody knows where any of the
pieces are, or any bits of scrap which may be
useful, let me know, or drop a line into the
R S M Union Office.
Finally if anybody is interested in helping out
with the rebuilding of C l e m just get in touch.
The club meets every Wednesday in the R S M
Union Office at 1:00pm.
M u c h ta.

Last F r i d a y G u i l d s C a r n i v a l was a great
success with everyone having a great, fantastic
marvellous, spacer, etc, time. Thanks to all
those who arranged it and helped to make it
one of the best ever.
The C & G U / O p e r a t i o n Drake float went
down well at the Lord Mayors Show last
S a t u r d a y , d e s p i t e the fact that all the
Guildsfolk were still suffering from Carnival's
excesses.
Enough of the past—now to the forthcoming
Guilds spectaculars.
This Saturday (November 20) we have Silly
Sports outside Harrods. This is one of the
most enjoyable Rag events of the year and is
where Guildsfolk impress (?) the Harrods
customers with their amazing acrobatic and
idiotic skills and then ask for/demand large
sums of money for charity. Meet in the Guilds
Office at 9:00am this Saturday.
A n d finally for those of you who suffer from
the midweek blues we have on Wednesday
November 24: Morohv Day, on which we take
on R C S and Mines in a battle for the Morphy
O a r . Traditional ammunition consisting ot
bulls blood, rotting eels, guts, etc. Traditional
armour in pink (mmm-nice) bin-liners. A l l
cavalry, artillery and foot soldiers meet in the
Guilds Office at 12:30pm from where we will
march down to Putney towpath and let battle
commence (after the rowing races). Cream
teas will be served in Harrods for all survivors
and those agile enough to escape Harrods'
security guards.
See you at the above events.

24hr Rag
T h i s marvellous event is being held f r o m
midnight tonight onwards. Turn up at any time
from 11:00pm onwards to collect licences,
cans and find a place to collect. Hopefully we
can raise more money than last time it was
held (over £1,000) so we need lots of you to go
a n d a c c o s t the g e n e r a l p u b l i c for t h e i r
coppers—but don't accost the coppers.
This is a really almost legal Rag stunt and
should be a big money-raiser.

FELIXI
Funny, satirical, and also grim. Described also
as 'hilarious if subversive' this film featuring the
i n c o m p a r a b l e V a s u d e v a R a u as an aged
layabout, is the second in India Society's short
season of works by accomplished directors. •
Minnal Sen is a highly talented director, but
O k a Oorie Katha is the only one of his films to
be released SQ far in the U K . This is then a rare
chance to see a work of his here, despite Nigel
Andrews' view (of the Financial Times) that
" i t w o u l d clearly feel m u c h at h o m e . " I
sincerely hope many of you will take this
opportunity to see it, on Tuesday at. 6:00pm in
M e c h Eng 220. The copy will of course by fully
subtitled in English.

SF Soc
or: the Further Adventures of Burt the
Bacterium
W i t h a high p i t c h e d s c r e a m she lunged
forward and tore at my cell wall. One of my sex
pili came away in her long nailed hand.
Shuddering with pain I lashed out with my
flagella, striking the woman across the head
and chest. She staggered backwards and I
pressed in on the offensive, firing both R and F
plasmids at her now bleeding wounds.
" N o ! " she gasped, "You'll only make it
worse for yourself. R u n while you still have the
chance!"
For then it was that I heard the ominous
throbbing noise coming from behind me. With
a bias random walk I turned around and faced
my foe. A h , yes! I knew him well—Wally the
White Blood Cell; we had met many times
before in the seedy capillaries of the heart and
brain. His horribly deformed cell membrance
bulged grotesquely out in my direction,
catching my flagella. Slowly 1 was being drawn
towards that seething mass ot digestive
enzymes

STOIC
O K , so Southside can recieve Channel 4 and
S T O I C , l u c k y people. Right, o n with the
column.
S o m e of y o u m a y h a v e n o t i c e d t h e
temporary disappearance of the Southside T V
Lounge set last week. This was for modifica-
tion, or rather r e - i n d o c t r i n a t i o n , as y o u r
friendly cathode ray tube was beginning to
have ideas of its own. At one point the set
refused to automatically switch to S T O I C
transmissions when commanded. A retraining
course was obviously necessary, and after a
few hours under the scalpel of Oberengineer-
ingfuhrer Nick W Graham-Taylor, the Philips
G i l returned to an existence as free from
original thought as the J C R set.
If any of you, whilst passing your free time
watching S T O I C ' s hybrid waveforms notice
any slight variation from technical perfection
gives us a bell on internal 2637 and we'll send
the boys round.
O n a lighter note, we wish Martin S Taylor
the best of luck with his fight against the
tyrannical cospir (aha! Insurrection from the
typewriter) c o n s p i r a c y of the m e c h a n i c a l
proletariat, ie, the folding machine...we know
the feeling.
