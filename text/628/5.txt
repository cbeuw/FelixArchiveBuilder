Council
Council is the main decision-
m a k i n g b o d y o f I C U n i o n ,
s e c o n d o n l y t o t h e U n i o n
General Meeting in its authority.
It only meets three or four times
a term and yet last M o n d a y over
half its members failed to show
up. I was not there either, even
though it is part o f my job to
attend. W h y this surge of apathy
by those who are elected repre-
sentatives o f the student body?
Answer: only t w o notes were
sent o u t t o advise us o f the
meeting, one by M a r y Freeman
last J u l y , a n d o n e w h i c h I
received four hours before the
start o f the meeting.
Security
M a n y p e o p l e are c o n c e r n e d
about the amount o f theft from
the U n i o n G y m and other parts
o f the U n i o n B u i l d i n g , a n d
Christine Teller has written to
ask me to ask you not to leave

T e l l e r , i n c i d e n t a l l y ? H a s she
forgotten that she isn't Deputy
President any more?) Anything
suspicious should be reported to
the U n i o n Office or M r Reeves
in Security immediately. Y o u
should also carry your U n i o n -
card at all times; while the thefts
continue, U n i o n officers will be
carrying out spot checks, and
anyone without a Unioncard is
liable to be thrown out o f the
building.
FELIX Dinner
T h i s i s o n D e c e m b e r 3, a
fortnight today. The cost is £8.50
for an n course meal, everyone is
welcome and the guest speaker is
Sue A r n o l d o f the Observer.
Names to the F E L I X Office by
Tuesday lunchtime, please. Post-
dated cheques will be accepted.
Copy Deadline
When M a r y Freeman resigned I
produced a one page F E L I X in
three hours and everyone was
f u l l o f p r a i s e . E a c h week I
produce a sixteen page F E L I X
in forty-eight hours (three days,
allowing me eight hours sleep)
and everyone is incredulous that
I need so m u c h t i m e . C o p y
deadline is 1730h M o n d a y , and
anything received after that time
may not go in. I also reserve the
right to cut letters and small ads
which are excessively silly, long
or anonymous.

I ' M G L A D T O see that J Martin
T a y l o r hasn't t o t a l l y r e t i r e d
from the political scene at I C
after his p r e s i d e n t i a l election
d e f e a t i n M a r c h l a s t y e a r .
S e c o n d a n d t h i r d years w i l l
remember that last year IC was
o v e r r u n w i t h M a r t i n T a y l o r s
(four, actually) two of whom, to
the best o f my knowledge, have
left, one is F E L I X Editor, and
one, J M a r t i n Taylor, is now
doing a postgraduate course i n
Nuclear Fuels where he and his
officemates spend much time
explaining to visitors that n o ,
this is not the Martin Taylor this
is s o m e o n e else. G o d k n o w s
w h a t c o n f u s i o n w o u l d have
reigned if he'd succeeded in his
presidential campaign.
D u r i n g his career as a super-
hack, M a r t i n acquired a reputa-
tion as a maker o f long boring
speeches and this, together with
his commendable determination
to represent the views o f non-
hacks, made h i m many enemies
on Council. This is a great pity,
as he is a warm and sympathetic
person with a generous sense of
h u m o u r w h i c h he f r e q u e n t l y
turns against himself, his much-
mocked northern accent and his
frequent social gaffes. His classic
quote concerned D a v i d Owen:
" H e was even more boring than
I a m ! " It takes a brave man to
make a joke like that.
M o r e recently, at an outing of
Martin Taylors, he demonstrated
his aptitude for bewildering his
companions when he studied a
r e s t a u r a n t m e n u f o r a f e w
m i n u t e s b e f o r e a s k i n g t h e
F E L I X Editor in all seriousness
" W h a t is a sausage?"
Finally, to dinner with Enoch
Powell during his visit to College
a few weeks back. M r Powell
had his meal at the Rector's
house i n the company o f L o r d
F l o w e r s , S t e p h e n G o u l d e r ,
several other important digni-
t a r i e s a n d , as i t h a p p e n e d ,
Martin Taylor. The conversation
turned to M r Powell's love o f
p h i l o l o g y , a n d his a b i l i t y to
speak twelve languages fluently.
A n impressive pause was broken
by a distinctive Lancashire tone
uttering in plonking voice "I've
got a n O - L e v e l i n F r e n c h , "
which effectively silenced further
conversation-
for the next ten
minutes.
T H E D I F F I C U L T I E S of making
light conversation with impor-
tant people are c o n s i d e r a b l e ,
though. It is said that L o r d ' R a b '
Butler, when Master of Trinity
College, always used to bandage
up his h a n d b e f o r e m e e t i n g
u n d e r g r a d u a t e s i n o r d e r t o
provide an immediate topic o f
conversation. N o such excuse
was needed by gangling F E L I X
Business Manager Peter Rodgers
when faced with L o r d Flowers
on a social occasion. H e looked
his straight in the eye and in his
aggressive Ulster accent snapped
" A r e y o u the Rector, then?"
L o r d Flowers, unflappable as
ever, remarked blandly " I a m
sometimes" which must be one
of the few recorded attempts at
rectorial humour.
A L L T H I S N O N S E N S E about
chain letters (which the Editor
and News Editor have started
calling ' C h a i n M a i l ' ) reminds me
of one my father was sent several
years ago. After all the usual
guff about sending copies to four
friends, moving names around
and adding your own name to
the foot o f the list, it continued
" N o w bundle up your wife and
send her to the address at the top
of the list; within three weeks
you will receive 1,024 women
from all different parts of the
country."
