secrecy and the continuity of the

The covering letter asserts that
the system is totally legal, and
this appears to be true. But the

attempt is made to step outside
the rules listed on the instruc-

are sent through the post or if
anyone replaces several names
on the list with his own name.

Obituary
P r e s i d e n t B r e e z e k n e e s , P r e s i d e n t of the
mighty state of Truthizov, has finally shuffled
off this mortal coil, and departed this earthly
sphere, at the age of 100. H e retained most of
his faculties to the end, in spite of four previous
r u m o u r s o f his d e m i s e . S i n c e a l l o l d
newspapers are periodically destroyed in order
that the lies conveyed within their pages are
not perpetuated, it is not known when these
rumours were. It is known, however, that the
President was over 50 when the first rumour
started, and that if we say that these rumours
occurred when the President was A , B, C and
D years old, where A , B, C , and D are not
necessarily all different, then A x B x C x D =
47,029,248, and A + B + C + D is an odd
number. It is of purely academic interest, of
course, but how old was the President when
these rumours occurred?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. £5 from
Mend-aBike for a randomly selected entry.
Last Week's Solution
First let me scotch a malicious rumour; I neither
am, nor ever have been, Martin S Taylor, S
M a r t i n T a y l o r , T a y l o r M a r t i n S, nor any
combination of the above. Alright? Y o u can
start guessing again.
Now back to last week. Taking the sheet A ,
B, C , D again, then the four sheets are:
A , B, C , D - 1, 3, 14, 16
! 2, 6, 11, 15
5, 7, 9, 13
4, 8, 10, 12
which must come in that order, since the
editorial page must be third (in the right
position), and if the sheet starting with page 4
were to come after the first sheet, then in the
folded F E L I X , page 4 would follow page 3,
which is not allowed ("no two consecutive
numbers in any position").
I was distressed to see three gentlemen
appear on Tuesday lunchtime, and all put
virtually identical (wrong) solutions in the box,
all headed "Dear Martin" (!), obviously a group
effort. If it really takes two or three of you to
solve a puzzle, then at least only hand in one
solution!

Of the six people who sent in entries with
the pages in the correct order, Phil Moore of
Elec Eng 3 was chosen as this week's winner,
and he can collect his £5 cheque from the
F E L I X Office after 1:30pm on Monday. Many
thanks also to Dave Parry for sending in a
complete (correct) miniature F E L I X as a
solution.
