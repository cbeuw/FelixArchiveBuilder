To NUS or not to NUS is a perennial question
in many students' unions, and ICU is no
exception. Five years ago we voted to stay out;
now, in view of the NUS grants campaign,
many students feel that it may be time to
reconsider the decision. PHIL NATHAN puts
the case for reaffiliation
NUS: The Case
For Reaffiliation
Five years ago, Imperial College students decided in a campus-wide
referendum to withdraw from the National Union of Students (NUS)
The decision was made on a margin of about fifty votes out of 1,500
votes cast. Many people still believe that the students' union should still
be in the NUS, and at the next Union General Meeting on December 7,
a motion will be heard, calling for the referendum required for
reaffiliation. Why should you vote for a referendum, and then,
ultimately for re-affiliation? How can NUS help us?
(1) Representation to
Government
The main work of the N U S is in
the annual grant claims made to
government. Last year the grants
campaign brought in for univer-
sity students a 4% grant increase.
In other words, it netted on
behalf of Imperial students more
than £200,000. The Department
o f E d u c a t i o n a n d S c i e n c e
recognises o n l y one r e p r e -
sentative student body, the N U S ,
and this is the organisation the
D E S consults when it is consider-
ing any aspect o f student
welfare, be it housing, prescrip-
tion charges or parental grant
c o n t r i b u t i o n s . N U S is the
organisation that Members of
P a r l i a m e n t c o n s u l t before
making up their minds on many
different things that effect our
lives. It is the strength of N U S
with its 1.2m members which
gives us a 4% grant increase; no
indivdiual students union could
manage this on its own. 1.2m
student voters united in a grants'
claim form an extremely power-
ful lobbying body. The N U S
negotiates for our grants, we
should join and support it.
The N U S has fought effectively
against the i n t r o d u c t i o n of
student loans and has been the
major force in opposing them
for many years; it has managed
to organise surveys in other
parts of the world where the
loans system does operate and
has gone back to government
with concrete evidence that
shows loans have a higher rate of
default, cause an expensive
system of administration, and
Phil Nathan
prevent poorer students from
entering further education. Only
a national body like N U S can do
things like this. In opposing
student loans, it has been worth
its weight in gold. The recent
defeat of the new, government
proposed crippling grant regula-
tions, was due largely to the
skilful lobbying and representa-
tion of the student case, to'
members of parliament, carried
out by N U S . The amount of
misery and financial strain that
the N U S has saved us in helping
to defeat these government plans
is not possible to measure but in
financial terms it must be far
greater than the 9% of our
student grant r e q u i r e d for
affiliation.
(2) Services to Students
The student railcard came about
after N U S negotiations with
British Rail and over the years
this has saved individual students
pounds and pounds. The Inter-
national Student Identification
C a r d (ISIC), giving discount
travel for all over Europe and
further, along with many other
advantages, was brought about
through the work of the N U S .
Those of us who insure with
Endsleigh, are involved with a
company that was set up by
NUS. It supplies cheaper insur-
ance a n d better i n s u r a n c e
schemes, designed specifically
for students.
There are many, many other
ways in which the N U S helps
students, the national discount
scheme, legal protection, welfare
services, national competitions,
a national student newspaper
and much more.
(3) Helping Our Students Union
D o you think our student union
works effectively and efficiently?
In the past year more than 2,000
union officers have attended
N U S training courses. The N U S
development and training depart-
ment has recently devised a
special accounting system for
student unions which is now
used in more than 350 unions. In
a d d i t i o n sabbatical regional
officers are on hand to give
advice and assistance in negoti-
ations with College (refectory
boycotts!!) and local authori-
ties, to all the unions affiliated to
NUS. They are also equipped to
give expert help and advice on
the financial control, adminis-
tration and development of
student unions.
The evidence for supporting
N U S and joining it is over-
whelming; yet what were the
reasons put forward for disaffi-
liation five years ago.
A . It was said that N U S was
ineffectual and badly organised.
How do those in favour of N U S
membership counter this? The
answer is quite simple and can
be provided by three MPs:
"NUS is highly professional
and argues the case of students
extremely well. " - S i r W i l l i a m
van Straubenzee, Tory M P and
former Junior Education Mini-
ster.
"NUS is one of the country's
most effective educational pres-
sure groups." - Shirley Williams,
S D P Leader, Former Secretary
of State for Education.
"The work of NUS is essential
in campaigns against education
cuts." — Neil Kinnock, Labour
Shadow Education Minister.
N U S is not perfect, but it is
organised well and though it
may be difficult for some to
a c c e p t , N U S is a well c o -
ordinated and effective student
organisation.
B. Lefties: this is no kind of
reason for anything; however it
was said that the organisation
was dominated by 'trots' and
'commies'. A l l N U S Executive
members are d e m o c r a t i c a l l y
elected at N U S conference—they
have included Socialist, Conser-
vative, C o m m u n i s t , L i b e r a l
and Labour students. The domi-
nant grouping for the last five
years was the 'left alliance', a
coalition including Liberal and
Labour students, but now the
Labour Students hold sway. O f
course political colour makes
little difference since elected
members are all committed to
student welfare and that's what
counts. Few would argue that
their efforts have not been of
great benefit to students.
C. Finance: The most foolish
and short-sighted reason —
'Look, we can save 9% of our
student grant,' it was said, 'the
money is just being wasted'; but
NUS repays over and over again
the affiliation money in grant
claims, welfare services, discount
schemes, etc. Because N U S is
not seen to hand a lump sum
of money back to the Union
which pays the affiliation fee,
'blind' people said it was a waste
of money.
D . Undemocratic: Five years
ago it was the case that not all
delegates to the national con-
ference were d e m o c r a t i c a l l y
elected. At the last conference a
motion calling for all delegates
to be elected in cross-campus
b a l l o t s was passed by the
required two-thirds majority,
and when it is passed again at
the c o m i n g c o n f e r e n c e , a l l
delegates will be democratically
elected.
At the present moment in time
Imperial College students live
off the backs of other students in
this c o u n t r y ; g a i n i n g many
advantages of N U S without
c o n t r i b u t i n g a n y t h i n g a n d
having no say in the way student
views are put to Government or
a n y o n e else. A vote for a
referendum on December 7 will
allow d e m o c r a t i c discussion
a b o u t N U S , w i l l a l l o w a l l
students to have a say; and
reaffiliation will bring us back
into the community of students;
will give us more N U S benefits
and will improve the running of
our student union. Our era of
parasitism will be over.
Vote for a Referendum on Dec 7
