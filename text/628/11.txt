Firsts
IC vs Goldsmiths I 4-1
This was a crucial first round of
the U L U C u p played against a
team determined to show I C
how lucky we were to draw with
them last season 1-1. Played on a
s m o o t h H a r l i n g t o n A p i t c h
Imperial failed to stamp any
authority on the game during the
first half-hour allowing ' G o l d y s '
a free r u n of the p i t c h c u l -
minating in a nicely finished
goal. A goal down, Imperial
started to show a little more
aggression and soon fought back
to draw level before half time.
In the second half Imperial
started to control the game with
9 0 % o f the p l a y a n d s o o n
converted some fluent moves
i n t o t h r e e m o r e g o a l s f r o m
Geoff, A n d y and Paul ensuring
I m p e r i a l a s o u n d w i n a n d a
second round place in the C u p .
Team: Bell, Ayres, Franklin,
Riley, Parker, Bawal, Jones,
Paul, Andy, Walter, Garmes.
IC vs Gowan 1-0
G o w a n , a team from a division
above our own, were a skilful
side. Weakened, starting with
ten men, Imperial applied good
o p e n i n g pressure w i t h A n d y
Garmes doing some good run-
ning out wide on the left wing
swinging in some good balls for
Bell to neatly miss leaving a
scoreless sheet at half time. The
second half saw a very close
battle, especially in midfield with
both sides creating good chances
but failing to convert them to
goals. However, with about ten
minutes to go Garmes slotted a
Bansal cross into the net leaving
Imperial to survive a final ten
minute onslaught before pro-
gressing to the second round of
the Middlesex C u p .
T e a m : Sean, Barry, Geoff,
Steve, Chris, Jones, Andy, Paul,
Andy G, Mangat and Walter.
IC vs Brunei 4-0
Yet another sound victory in the
d i v i s i o n against a useful but
disjointed Brunei side. Imperial
created all the chances in the
first half but the forwards failed
to convert these to goals and by
| half time it was still a scoreless
match.
However, in the second half
Imperial played some of their
best h o c k e y w i t h A n d y a n d
C h r i s h o l d i n g the d e f e n c e
together well and Captain Geoff
controlling the midfield distri-
buting the ball out to right wing
Mangat who put some nice deep
first time crosses through the
Brunei defence resulting in a hat-
trick for Bell and a rare Steve
P a r k e r g o a l — m u c h to the
delight of his girlfriend. (It's
funny how he seems to move
upfield whenever she's around?)
If Imperial can keep scoring like
this—and keep a tight defence—
how can we lose?
Seconds
IC vs Mill Hill 0-1
W i t h I C all i l l ,
Against a team like M i l l H i l l ,
We were never going to win.
The pitch was so bad,
A g a i n Purdy got mad,
A n d Slatter let their goal i n .
Between his legs went the ball,
Such a surprise to us all.
Oh Rolf, what a terrible sin!
Charles missed a sitter,
A n d Dave did not better.
W h e n he tried kicking it in.
N o Hope couldn't score,
He missed the target for sure,
A n d so all four chances were
blown.

weren't too happy with changing
positions, since some required
more tactical manoeuvring than
others. G r o u p organiser, Sara,,
did suggest that once you've
done one you've done them a l l ,
but in games of this nature she
has been known to get around a
bit.
Game: Sticky situations did
arise, but these were not insur-
mountable. M o v i n g it from side
to side appeared to have better
results than placing it straight
down the middle.

whereas Karen was a bit less
daring and centred one perfectly.
Thus the game progressed until

showers.
Rugby
Seconds
IC vs Rosslyn Park Vths 36-6
The day after Carnival saw IC
make a slow and ponderous start
against Roslyn Park 5ths. It took
f o r t y minutes before the I C
players decided that perhaps
they didn't get that drunk the
previous evening and locomotion
was indeed still possible. F r o m
t h e n o n I C r a r e l y left t h e i r
opponents half and starved the
opposition of nearly all posses-
s i o n . S t r o n g w o r k f r o m the
forwards ensured plenty ball for
a g o o d a t t a c k i n g b a s e l i n e ,
although at times the handling
left something to be desired. A
good move in the three-quarter
line and strong running from
Phil Clarke gave Roger F l y n n a
touchdown in the corner for the
last try of the game. Tries were
also scored by Roger (2), Paul,
J o h n , Charles, A n d y , M i c k y and
J i m to give a final score of 36-6.
Ten Pin Bowling
IC vs Portsmouth Poly 2-8
A t long last, there was actually
some excitement for the Bowling
C l u b last week when the coach
b r o k e d o w n a n d the d r i v e r
wandered off to a neaby hostelry
to discuss the state of the world
with the landlord. While he was
away two officers of the law
t u r n e d u p a n d d e s p i t e I a n
Ridgley's efforts to open the
door they managed to get in.

nicely and managed to persuade
the police not to take us all in as
long as M a r k Sample agreed to
donate a pint of blood to the
Police Christmas Ball fund. The
driver eventually turned up and
carefully avoided breathing in
the general direction of the P C s
and a replacement coach got us
home only n hours late.
Back to the grind on Sunday
as the I C team lost to Portsmouth
Poly but we pushed them much
harder than usual, our A team in
particular managed to tread all
over the opposition. Megastar of
the day was Dave Gee with a
series of 616.
Rifle & Pistol
Another exciting week down on

scores registered by Steve and

Sorry to say that the Thirds
and Fourths are slipping behind
in the points table. The Firsts
hammered K C H and are u n -
d o u b t e d l y one o f t h e m o s t
powerful sides out of all the

also have a walkover (5-0) to
their credit after the rearranged
match against Westfield 1 was
again cancelled.
