Dear FELIX
I a m w r i t i n g to c o m p l a i n
about the size of the paving
stones in the streets around I C .
O n average I tend to hit a crack in
the pavement once every three
strides. T h i s means that m y
grandmother dies 1,000 times
each day! If I were to try to
a v o i d the c r a c k s , this w o u l d
mean walking like a 1920s film,
or leaping around as if practising
f o r the O l y m p i c t r i p l e j u m p
record. In all honesty, could
s o m e t h i n g not be d o n e , l i k e
chopping me off at the knees
(preferably the top half!).

Diwali
Celebrations
Dear Sir
Last Saturday (Nov 13) was
the day of the annual D i w a l i
Celebrations held by the India
Society i n the J C R . This is by far
the biggest single function held
by the society each year and
attracts large c o n t i n g e n t s o f
I n d i a n / A s i a n students of varied
b a c k g r o u n d s f r o m a l l o v e r
L o n d o n . Such a crowd of diverse
ethnic origins w o u l d I presume
dictate a function to be varied to
suit most people if not all.
Alas the function was nothing
o f the k i n d . T h e m a i n p a r t
c o n s i s t e d o f ' P u n j a b i ' songs
p u n c t u a t e d by a few ' H i n d i '
songs. This session lasted for at
least an hour and a half. H a v i n g
being throughly bored by now
we were subjected to yet another
piece of Punjabi culture: Bhangra
d a n c i n g . T h e n f o l l o w e d the
Page 4
Disco and would you believe it,
yes, Punjabi songs had almost
half the share. A s a non-Punjabi
myself and I am sure speaking
f o r h u n d r e d s m o r e , I w a s
thoroughly bored a n d frustrated
a n d felt o u t - o f - p l a c e at this
function.
I w o u l d l i k e to a s k t h e
P r e s i d e n t w h y w a s s u c h a
Punjabi-biased show allowed to
c a r r y o n w h e n he h i m s e l f
assured us that " P u n j a b i biased
functions would not take place if
he were elected, as has happened
in the p a s t , " at his e l e c t i o n
speech! India Society is a society
to cater for the needs of all its
members, who I assure you are
not all Punjabis. I cannot see the
point of paying £1.50 for the
enjoyment of one section of the
crowd when half of them were
bored sick and wondering why
w e r e t h e y h e r e ! D i w a l i is
celebrated all over India, not
only in the Punjab. The Presi-
dent requires a lesson in geo-
graphy as it seems he cannot see
further than the Punjab! I feel he
has a lot of explaining to do to
his fellow members.

Dear FELIX
W h e n I applied to I C to study
civil engineering, I did so on the
understanding that the facilities
for this course were some of the
finest in the country. However,
the department cannot claim to
provdie for all the needs of its
students where it does not install
a coffee-machine, the lack of
w h i c h causes great h a r d s h i p ,
stress a n d e x e r c i s e to o v e r -
worked civil engineers as we
rush to the J C R and back.
W h y is it that inferior disci-
plines, such as M e c h E n g and
Physics, should have their own
coffee-machines? M o r e to the
point, is it fair that we pay 16p
for coffee i n the buttery, whilst
physicists pay a mere 9p? I tend
to the conclusion that someone
has a protection racket on here; I
mean, w h o w o u l d p a y g o o d
money for a cup of bitumen from
M r M o o n e y when he could enjoy
a decent drink at a fairer price?
A p a r t f r o m t h e p r e s t i g e
g a i n e d b y t h e d e p a r t m e n t ,
students would feel far more
inclined to attend lectures on
time. It would also encourage
contact between the years.

Dear Martin
U p o n gaily tripping Into the
F E L I X Office oi ;
y I was
confronted by the vvoeful (alas
and alack) sight of an unfolded
F E L I X . W h i l s t g a t h e r i n g
together the assorted sheets and
folding them in the wrong order.
I attempted a little trivial light
c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h a r a t h e r
u n s a v o u r y g e n t l e m a n w i t h a
beard, sitting on one of your
tables drinking coffee.
I opened with an innocent
s n i p p e t a b o u t t h e s t a t e o f
F E L I X , thrown casually to the
wind, and he replied with the
s u b t l e c h a r m a n d e l o q u e n t
repartee of a L i v e r p o o l docker
w i t h a c r o w b a r t h r o u g h h i s
head.
Somewhat taken aback, and
fearing he might' do something
hasty like tear me limb from
limb and feed me to the folding
machine, I wished h i m good-day
and sallied hence to m y place of
residence.
It is now my painful duty to
e x a c t s a t i s f a c t i o n f o r t h i s
a f f r o n t , f o r w h i c h I d e m a n d
either that you nail the offending
gentleman's naughty bits to the
rafters, or that you print this
letter and give me a free cup of
F E L I X coffee, whichever costs
you less time, money or step
ladders.

Dear Martin
I was sitting i n the F E L I X
Office last week drinking tea
w h e n s o m e o b n o x i o u s w e e d
poked his head through the door
demanding a F E L I X . A s the
folding machine had recently
d i e d , s a i d p u b l i c a t i o n w a s
u n f o l d e d w h i c h s e e m e d to
a g g r i e v e s a i d p a r t y g r e a t l y .
W h e n I informed the gentle-
man of his democratic right to
ask the E d i t o r to resign if he felt
he could do the job better he
flew into a frenzy, holding forth
with all the force of a w o o d elf.
Really M a r t i n , I must question
your policy of letting plebs past
the h a l l o w e d p o r t a l s o f the
F E L I X Office if this is all they're
going to do.

Bodies
Dear Sir or Madam
I a m w r i t i n g i n t h o r o u g h
disgust after my recent perusal
of J o n Barnett's little white book
in which I was shocked to find
n o w a r n i n g to u n s u s p e c t i n g
freshers of the certain activities
of particular bodies that exhibit
a certain duality and hence can
be found interfering with them-
selves in specific laboratories in
the infamous den of iniquity, the
Blackett Laboratory. Being a
second year physicist I was not
overly shocked but* the thought
of the aforementioned particular
bodies exhibiting this behaviour
in places open to unsuspecting
and innocent first year students
brings me to ask for the expul-
sion from the College of all
bodies using their wave-particle
properties in such an unseemly
manner.

News (again)
Dear Martin
In reply (if one is needed!) to
G l y n Garside's accusations of
anti-socialist reporting in last
week's news: the reason for his
attack seems to be that I do not
bias the news towards his way of
t h i n k i n g . * I a m t h e r e f o r e a
R e a c t i o n a r y C a p i t a l i s t , a n d
because I do not go in for the
ego-trip of plastering my name
under every news item that I
write (eight last week) I a m
cowering behind the agonymity
of the Fascist Press!
F o r a member of the Debating
Society, M r Garside is remark-
ably unfamiliar with the English
l a n g u a g e . T h e w o r d ' b e t r a y '
which he has worried to death
does not imply an attempt at
subversiveness, but to 'indicate
o r s h o w s i g n ( o f ) ' (Collins
Dictionary). In point of fact I
agreed with much of Sir Ashley's
speech; presumably if I had let
my opinions show through the
news article M r Garside would
not have complained.
I would point out that while
we d i d edit our his numerous
spelling and grammatical errors,
M r G a r s i d e m i g h t r e m e m b e r
that it is better to keep silent and
to be thought stupid, than to
write illiterate letters to F E L I X
and remove all doubt.
Yours arrogantly
