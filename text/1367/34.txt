IC 3rd Hunks beat IC Medic runts

in awe of his fine finish. The Med-
ics’ constant barrage of attacks to-
wards the end of the first half were
no doubt due to Apu’s request for
them to “thank you come again”
every time they ventured towards
his beloved Kwike-D.
Stunning work from the back four
It was the game the Medics had
been dreading; the second coming
of ICHC Mens 1sts, crusaders sent
to test them to their limit, would
they be able to muster a more sub-
stantial rebuttal this time around in
their own battleground? The pre-
match warm-up of smashing balls
at our keeper was replaced, for one
week only, by Batty pitching the ball
into Star Wars’ head. The resulting
mess meant we had to call upon the
help of the dark side to re-attach
Star Wars’ head with steri-strips!
With the team patched up, warmed
up and after half an hour of waiting
for the umpires to arrive it was time
for battle to commence.
IC took advantage of the Medics
morphine-enriched state-of-being
and shipped three clinical goals
from Jumaji and Star Wars past
them quicker than you can say ‘ca-
daver’ before conceding two highly
dubious goals prior to half-time.
Ratty showed his prowess in front
of goal, leaving the Medic defence
prevented many Medic chances;
the ever present Shipman (who
has now retired from medicine)
and the ever-injured Foetus work-
ing well together in the middle,
with wing-backs Mountie and Skip-
per Harvester feeding the midfield
well. Date Rape managed to step in
for Krusty, who had earlier fallen
over his oversize shoes, with halves
Batty and Toady creating many an
opportunity for the finely-tuned at-
tack. After Batty made his hat-trick
of flying ball injuries in two weeks
(one broken jaw, one cut-open head,
one “broken rib”), the sweet short
Hockey 1sts get six over those damnéd Medics
The IC 3rd XI season was defined
last Saturday in the biggest fixture
this term; a ULU meeting between
the auld enemies, Imperial and Im-
perial Medics.
To set the scene: we’ve had a
few big games this term and our
form put us in the position of be-
ing the firm favourites for this
game. Earlier in the term only a
late Medic goal prevented us from
beating the Imperial Medic 1st XI,
the result being an unfortunate
2-2 draw, which quite rightly was
celebrated emphatically by the
Medic 1st XI as they had amaz-
ingly managed to grab a draw.
Now, to elaborate on the chosen
headline. I must tell you that the ti-
tle of 3rd Team Hunks was not cho-
sen by our modest team of freshers
and old-pros but was decided by the
supporters of Bucks University the
previous Wednesday. At the sight
of our entrance onto the pitch,
whispers were overheard from the
Bucks substitutes suggesting that
wewere“awellgood-lookingteam.”
I won’t deny that we count in
our ranks a number of heart-
breakers but who are we to sug-
gest that we are the fittest team
at Imperial? We are actually the
fittest team at Imperial, though.
To the game! A late fitness test
saw breaking news across the tab-
loid press. Tim Hoult, our rock in
defence, was suffering from con-
cussion after head-butting a Bucks
player in our previous fixture. Un-
swerved, we decided our best tactic
forsuchagamewouldbetokeepthe
ball for the first 20 minutes, which
as expected led to Medics putting
in some lame tackles to try to gain
some possession. At this point Jai
Dave taught them how to tackle
properly in a classic man-and-ball
tackle, which signalled our decision
to start creating a few chances.
The first goal came mid-way
through the half. A Deemo
Georghiou through ball found AK
who ran through on goal, only to
have his effort blocked by the on-
rushing keeper. The block left
the ball high in the air for the in-
coming Jai Dave to head the ball
over the two defenders block-
ing the goal and into an open net.
This meant we could relax for
the rest of the half and laugh at
the Medic cheerleader who found
himself playing central-midfield.
He sure could talk, but he did not
touch the ball once in the first half,
which is quite embarrassing see-
ing as he was playing in the cen-
tre of the pitch. Seriously, mate.
The first half finished with long-
range efforts from Sam Rickards
and Stewart Masters, who had
done more than anyone to ensure
we went into the interval ahead.
The second half saw an ac-
ceptance from the Medics that
they couldn’t play football as they
switched style and sent a barrage
of long-balls over the centre backs
heads. They were dealt with eas-
ily by Jan Marchant in central de-
fence and Milky Botchway in goal.
However, the cheerleader was
still maintaining they were still
in the game and that the number
of attacking chances we were
creating would come to nothing.
The second goal came from a
penalty. The first attempt was a
shocker as Captain James Blyth
forgot that his most potent weapon
is his shin and not his right foot and
sent a tame shot down the keeper’s
throat. However, cleverly Max Steel
had encroached into the box drag-
ging Medic defenders with him,
which led to the referee asking for
the penalty to be retaken. AK slot-
ted the second attempt away nicely.
Some late pressure gave the
Medics a scrabbled goal from a
corner but the introduction of The
Camel, and some fine central mid-
field work from playmaker Adam
Masters, added the extra compo-
sure needed to see out the rest of
the game. It was a deserved win,
which saw some good football in the
first half and a fine effort against
the conditions in the second half.
Seriously though, Medics,
you still have a chance at Var-
sity as we have beaten our 2nd
XI as well as yours. No excuses
from the Medic 3rd XI either as
the Hunks fancy their chances.
(Definition: Hunk – a well-
built, sexually attractive man.)
The lads after getting their choppers seen to (the ones in their gums, you dirty old fool)
corner routine saw the ball move
between Date Rape, Star Wars
and finally Batty, slotting one in be-
tween the Medics. To his credit, the
Medic defender who intercepted
that flight of the ball on his back did
actually play on – no harm done!
Despite their best efforts, the
scum never really got back into the
game. Tempers frayed and emo-
tions boiled over (mainly between
the Medics themselves, as usual!
It’s not often you play against a
team who apparently really do
hate each other’s guts) as the final
whistle approached to sound the
death knell on a now limp and be-
leaguered medical school.
Themostmemorabledispute(oth-
er than the comedy Medic bitching)
being the eruption between the still
wounded Star Wars and a shinpad-
less Cretin. The whistle eventually
arrived to put the scum out of their
misery. Two lasting post-match
memories being the scum referring
to ICHC as the dirtiest team they
had played ever ever in the history
of everness (oh well, grapes of the
unripened variety I guess), and a
certain ICHC player being heard
to say “Don’t worry umps, it was
my first game too” as he shook the
umpire’s outstretched hand of con-
gratulation. Ouch.
IC 1sts, intent on beating the Medics with an ugly stick (Ed. - what the hell are you on about? You’re fired)
