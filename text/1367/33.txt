For the last crossword of the year
I’ve decided to throw in a few
seasonal clues despite it still being
a few weeks from Christmas. If
that offends your sensibilities, I do
apologise - put the paper down and
don’t look at it again until the 25th.
Consider it my present to all of you.
Since there will be no issue until
mid-January, you’ll have a whole
month in which to puzzle over it,
though I’m fairly confident it won’t
take quite that long.
Incidentally, I would like to thank
everyone who does the crossword
on a regular basis, or even just at-
tempts it. It makes our work worth-
while, and we hope you will contin-
ue to do so. Scarecrow
Send your answers to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk (even though
there’s no sudoku, amusingly enough) or bring this page down to the Fe-
lix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad by the 7th of January. We’ll then
choose a winner from the small pile of submissions and present them
with a tenner or, if they prefer, a handshake of congratulation.

Aqueerius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
You’re going to die.
Probably not soon, but
you’ll eventually die.
The likelihood is that
your death with be
painful and protracted,
thanks to modern medicine and the
illegality of euthanasia. So while
you still can, whip out your dingle
and wave it at some strangers.
Goatfucker (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
The Bearded Intruder
seems not to have
done any horoscopes
this week, but we’re
not sure. He lurks in
the darkest corners of
the West Basement, living off lost
freshers and minipizzas (Chicago
Town for preference). He is also a
massive gimp.
Sagtitarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
This week, I did stuff
with girls. It was
great. And I didn’t
pay them or anything.
However, I’ve got a
nasty tingly feeling
in my downstairs mix-up. And my
wallet is gone. Wait, where am I?
Why am I hogtied to this 4x4? And
who painted my genitalia green?
Scorpenis (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
This week’s selection
of the week’s finest
weekly events is spon-
sored by Jackanory.
Why? BECAUSE
NOBODY TELLS A
STORY LIKE... JACKANORY. No
siree, nobody tells a story like...
wait for it... goddamn wait for it!
JACKANORY. /shoots self.
This Week’s Artichokes
Gaymini (22 May – 21 Jun)
This week you’ll be
confronted by a fat
man in spandex. He’ll
demand that you
observe his pitifully
small tackle (he, un-
like you, gets a kick out of being
humiliated in public). Just do it.
You don’t want to disappoint your
therapist again.
Pile of Bull (21 Apr – 21 May)
Today you get ar-
rested. Why are you
laughing, fucko? You
broke the law, and
you’ve got to pay. Get
in the back of this van.
No, I don’t care if you can’t breathe
properly. Shut up! You make me do
this to you. Aw, don’t urinate every-
where, this trim is new.
Arse (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Last night, I drank a
lot of vodka. Funny
things happen when
I drink vodka. Specfi-
cally, I gain the ability
to seduce any lady in
the known universe. The only flaw
in this otherwise awesome talent
is sometimes what I thought was a
young lady is actually a lamp post.
Piss (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
It’s the end of the
world as we know
it. It’s the end of the
world as we know
it. It’s the end of the
world as we know it,
and I feel fine. Fine. If you’re not
humming the song, you’re a giant
loser, and I fucking hate you. Go
read a book, fatty.
STOP PRESS (23 Sept – Oct 22)
We have received the
following statement;
“I, Sir Bearded J
Intruder III, wish it to
be known that I most
certainly do not live
off junk food, and most of the miss-
ing freshers were nothing to do
with me. I’ll see you in court. Don’t
forget your tennis racket.”
Loser (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Jokes I’ve heard this
week: 1) What’s the
difference between
football and rape?
Women don’t like foot-
ball. 2) 99% of women
kiss with their eyes closed, don’t
you know. That’s why it’s so bloody
hard to identify a rapist... I didn’t
make them up! Don’t complain!
Big Fucking Lion (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Incy wincy spider
climbed up your leg.
Down came your hand
and squashed that spi-
der’s head. Out came
the RSPCA and blew a
massive hole through your fucking
forehead with a 12 bore. You cruel
bastard. You could have gently
brushed it aside... but no. Prick.
Tumour (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Hey buddy. What’s
up? Yeah, I’m cool too.
So listen. You wanna
go out tonight? No?
Ah, why man? I’ve
got my pulling thong
all washed and ready to go, and I
even shaved my shoulders, bro.
You don’t want to be seen with me?
Fine, fuck you, you stupid fuck.

Given the stunning lack of com-
plaints and a fair few positive
comments over the removal of the
sudoku to make way for the first
of these columns, it seems there is
a good deal of interest in learning
how to solve crosswords, which is
very heartening.
One of the most troublesome
varieties of clue is when there are
simply two words or short phrases
in the clue - this almost invariably
means that the answer is a syno-
nym for both parts of the clue. For
example, “Maroon hair (6)” would
be “strand”, which is obvious in
retrospect but none too easy at at
the time. These can become all but
impossible if the setter has used
spurious synonyms or simply if one
of the words or phrases is too ob-
scure - for instance, “Open, for the
love of God! (5)” is agape, which
fairly obviously means open, but
more obliquely is also the word for
man’s love of God.
Particularly helpful in such sita-
tions is to be familiar with the set-
ter - each will have their own par-
ticular foibles and quirks, and will
approach an answer in very differ-
ent ways, so it pays to know wheth-
er they take a tenuous approach in
such situations or if they are more
pedantic, literal or even smartar-
sed (all setters are smartarsed, by
our very nature, though to different
degrees and with varying levels of
wit).
This becomes very useful when
faced with a clue which looks to
be outside your vocabulary - if the
setter avoids words which are not
generally in use you may be bark-
ing up the wrong tree, but if they
throwintheoccasionalobscureor
archaic solution. In these cases,
it can be a hindrance to eschew
a dictionary or thesaurus in the
belief that you are in some way
‘cheating’; reference works do
not provide the answers to clues
- except in concise crosswords,
where it defeats the point of the
puzzle to do so, although some
might suggest there is no point to
concise crosswords anyway - and
there is no shame in not knowing
the existence of a word when the
setter will often not have known
thewordthemselfuntiltheyfound
themselves faced with a particu-
lar gap in the grid. Regardless, it
should be easy enough to verify
the solution if the rest of the clue
is set well. Occasionally, you may
be faced with a clue that does
not fit the two part construction
of having both a synonym and a
cryptic part of the clue. This can
either mean that the setter has
come up with a particularly in-
teresting sort of clue - perhaps of
the likes of “Gegs (9,4)” meaning
“scrambled eggs” or “Nur (3,2)”
as a Down clue giving “run up”
- or that some or all of the clue
has multiple meanings within the
clue itself. A wonderful example
of this sort of clue appeared in the
Times a few weeks ago: “a runner
on snow would (4)” giving “skid”
since a ski is a runner on snow
and the suffix “-’d” is a contrac-
tion of would, and also someone
running on snow would indeed
skid. This highlights quite neatly
that even a rigorous clue with two
ways of solving need not have an
actual synonym in the clue.
