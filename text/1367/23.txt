Bringing in the New Year
Another New Year’s Eve, another bunch of anonymous geriatrics
New Year’s Eve is
another chance to go
to a house party full of
strangers or a chance
to go out, and get
responsibly drunk and
dance to Billie Jean.
What alternatives are
there for anyone? Matty
Hoban looks into it
from a music fan’s
perspective
I
hate house parties. There are rare
occasions when I enjoy a good
house party, ie. the times when
they have good music taste and
give me lots of free beer. It is a rar-
ity when this happens though. So I
try to steer clear of these events
and prefer to go to a gig. But when
it is New Year’s Eve, I do get invited round
to a house party. Yeah, it was fun when we
were underage and your parents are out on
a Christmas cruise, but getting stoned and
watching Christina Aguilera videos isn’t my
idea of fun.
What are the options open to you instead
of a house party on New Year’s Eve? Well,
you can always go out into London and end
up at an overpriced club or you could go to
a gig that – now thanks to the new licensing
laws – runs over the midnight hour. There
are a few options open to you and in the spir-
it of this month’s theme of independence,
there are smaller gigs and an alternative
to exploitative super-clubs. Enjoy this small
selection.
The Young Knives will be performing at the Frog NYE party
Charlottefield: they are friendly really
Silver Rocket New Year’s Eve Party
Charlottefield, [pockets]
Kentish Town Bull and Gate
This is personally where I will be heading as
I often frequent the Silver Rocket club-night
as they put on bands that I like: loud, noisy
and angular rock. A band that make music
like this is Charlottefield, from Brighton.
They are like Dischord hardcore punk, but
have a distinctly British post-punk edge.
Also playing are [pockets], a two-piece from
London who make a good racket. Along with
this live musical feast, the Silver Rocket
DJs provide a delicious combination of al-
ternative rock from the early 90s, proper
indie rock, post-punk and Girls Aloud (the
ultimate pop band). It is £7 advance, but
cheaper I imagine if you sign up on their
mailing list (google Silver Rocket). This is a
steal considering your average New Year’s
Eve club night will cost around £30000 entry.
But then because I am going, I don’t want a
load of idiots turning up and spoiling my fun;
if you’re nice then come along.
Spitz 10th Anniversary NYE Party
Billy Childish, The Chatham Singers
Spitz, East London
As mentioned in last month’s Femm, Spitz
is situated in East London. It has been
home to many a greater band and per-
former and now it is 10 years old, it wants
to celebrate that with a garage-blues leg-
end, Billy Childish. The theme of the night
is called ‘Not the same old blues crap’
and they didn’t lie with the entertaining
Chatham Singers in tow, it will be a differ-
ent way to celebrate the new year.
Mad Hatter’s Tea Party
And What Will Be Left Of Them?
Camden Barfly
If Camden takes your fancy then pop along
to this and watch a band knock together
rock, indie and electro in one unholy mess.
Things are always messy up here though,
if you like that kind of thing.
Frog New Year’s Eve Party
Young Knives, Larrikin Love
Kentish Town Forum
Since we’ve interviewed one of the founders
of Transgressive Records and introduced
you to Jeremy Warmsley, you may want to
attend this Transgressive Records themed
party. Frog is usually found at The Mean
Fiddler on a Saturday and many of you will
remember the nights queuing in the urine-
stink of the alley round from The Mean Fid-
dler. Maybe you will be happy to know that
Frog are hosting their New Year’s Eve party
at the Kentish Town Forum (just down the
way from the Bull
and Gate); a fan-
tastic venue where
I have seen many a
brilliant gig at.
For your aural
pleasure, there will
be Young Knives
playing, as well as
Larrikin Love and
Rumble Strips. If
you are into your
British indie-pop
then this should
be on your wish-
list. There will also
be post-punk and
danceable indie be-
ing DJed through-
out I imagine.
For £25, it may
seem a bit on the
pricey side for a gig,
but remember it is
New Year’s Eve and
there is a lot of fun
to be trampled on.
So put on your skin-
ny tie and get your-
self down there.
