The Islam debate
is a rather
depressing affair
and others to protect the civil rights
of Babar Ahmed, the way in which
this was done was in no doubt con-
troversial. Mr Smith swore and
became aggressive towards mem-
bers of Council; these facts are on
the record. He refused to leave, and
security guards had to be called;
this too is on the record. Some ac-
cused Mr Smith’s supporters of in-
timidating Union officers outside
the meeting, hence the use of the
term “alleged”.
I suggest you read up on what
happened: http://live.cgcu.

While I appreciate the rather
elegant turn of phrase you use in
your last paragraph, I fail to see
what point you’re making. I’m not
politically correct, and I’d be more
offended if you called me that.
Political correctness is complete
bullshit, and you can quote me on
that.
Dear Andy,
Reading the debate in the letters
pages surrounding the recent ar-
ticles on Islam has been, at best, a
rather depressing affair. I am sur-
prised that, presumably intelligent,
students of Imperial, such as Sam-
uel Lynas (Letters, 1st Dec), could
harbour such simplistic, biased and
generally distasteful views on race,
religion and history.
I would hate to think how unwel-
come and uncomfortable, say, for
example, a visiting Muslim student,
coming to Imperial for a short time,
might be made to feel by reading
some of Samuel Lynas’s ill advised
comments.
I am of the belief that students
should feel welcome and wanted
as members of our academic body
no matter there religious or cul-
tural background. Accordingly, we
should discourage attitudes and
legislation which may perpetuate
the marginalization of any ethic or
religious groups. When considering
questions of extremism in universi-
ties, as it is popular to do these days,
surely the most effective strategy is
to create an inclusive environment,
with in which, all students are able
to feel at ease in there surround-
ings. To marginalize or isolate
them, through bigoted commentary
or poorly conceived policy, is surely
to play into the hands of those who
wish to instil extremist ideals. De-
spite being non-religious myself, I
would hate to work in an environ-
ment which restricted the religious
expression of others (so long as
they do not infringe on the freedom
of anyone else).
That is not to say I do not believe
in free, open debate. However, it
must proceed with judicious care
and thought. In addition, an aware-
ness of the social/political context
with in which it is being made is
crucial; to debate the Jewish faith
is one thing, to do so in the throws
of 1930’s Nazi Germany is quite an-
other, to give a rather extreme illus-
tration of what I mean.
For instance, I would take issue
with Lynas’s rather throw away
comment that “Perhaps next week
Mr Raja could explain away the mil-
lennia of slaughter, enslavement,
rape, pillage and genocide com-
mitted by Muslins...”. Firstly, this
seems to ignore the fact that as far
as “slaughter, enslavement, rape,
pillage and genocide” go, our very
own western, predominantly Chris-
tian, nations have a pretty stunning
track record, what with Slavery, the
Inquisition, Vietnam, Iraq and the
Holocaust to name but a few events
peppering our past and present.
However, this is besides the point,
the real issue is that it is unjustifi-
able to identify, in anyway, today’s
Muslim citizens, be they students
at Imperial or not, to events which
Andy Sykes replies,
This is actually one of the most
reasoned replies we’ve had on this
topic (in my opinion).
The parallel drawn with McCa-
rthyism and “reds under the bed”
is an interesting one, and one that
I think is fairly valid. It is true that
the US government has, since the
attacks on Washington DC and
New York, used terrorists, and spe-
cifically Muslim extremist terror-
ismts, as scapegoat figures. This
climate of fear has clearly spread
to a good proportion of the western
world.
Things are beginning to come
to a head - the US electorate has
decided to reject Republican fear-
mongering, and fill both houses
with Democrats. We, on the other
hand, has experienced Islamic
extremism on our own soil, some-
thing that seemed impossible three
years ago.
What Mr Borsten says rings true,
and I hope I see more balanced let-
ters like this in future.
Sir,
I write in response to Christopher
Thomas’s opinion piece “Student
Politicians: hang them all now!”
(Felix 1365). Mr. Thomas calls for
cheaper drinks in Union bars, some-
thing I strongly believe in myself.
Mr. Thomas also challenges me on
the fact that I made it a campaign
point and manifesto pledge that I
would “correct the unacceptable
increase in bar and events prices”
and then goes on to accuse me of a
betrayal of trust because he had not
seen any decrease in prices (the fact
that we had not seen any increases
in prices since the start of my ten-
ure seems to have slipped Mr. Tho-
mas’s mind...). I hope Mr. Thomas
now feels suitably happy with the
changes to the offers on Wednesday
and Friday which have cut prices
(see the Union page for details), I
did feel that there was some irony
in the fact that I read this attack on
the same day as I was in meetings
working on these price cuts, meet-
ings which have been going on for
some time and are still ongoing. I
don’t expect that Mr. Thomas, or
many others I must admit, will now
perform a volte-face and trust us all
implicitly, but I do hope that I can
once again walk past the nearest
lamp-post without worrying about
the length of my neck.
We are working hard on the com-
mercial services provided by the
Union to its members and there
will be further improvements in the
near future, these things do take
time. Yes, we could cut a whole load
of prices tomorrow so why don’t we?
I, personally, would rather not cut
prices one week only to have to put
them up again one or two weeks af-
ter that. The question people must
ask is do they want us to go for a
head-line grabbing, gimicky price-
slash and then put prices up only a
few weeks after that, or would they
rather we made a business plan
and cut prices and then kept them
down. I know what I would like...

may or may not have been a part of
their cultural past. Should we prej-
udice German students in light of
their Nazi past? No.
As for “some unexplained media
bias” (Samuel Lynas, Letters, 1 st
Dec) against Muslims. Well there
certainly is a bias, as a cursory gla-
ce through the daily’s would testify,
but unexplained? No, it is very well
explained. During tense and trying
points of history there is a prec-
edent for the media, government
and public to seek a scapegoat, both
as an expression of frustration and
as a justification of actions, particu-
larly in the case of the government
(see McCarthyism and Commies,
for just one example). It has been,
in the past, the Jews, the commies,
the Irish, etc, etc, perhaps it is now
the turn of Muslims, what with
the mounting tensions in the mid-
dle east, the occupied territories in
Palestine, the war in Iraq and the
on going conflict in Afghanistan
creating massive tensions around
the globe (all of which we the Brit-
ish have a hand in).
Learning from our past is essen-
tial for the positive progress of hu-
manity, but, it is not good enough to
say Hitler bad, Stalin bad, Saddam
bad. We must understand the politi-
cal, economic and social attitudes
surrounding the murkier parts of
our history and how they played
a part in their development. This
brings me to my final point, com-
ments of the form “wake up to the
danger that Islam represents to
this country” (Samuel Lynas, Let-
ters, 1 st Dec) are a little too close
to the likes of “the danger that Jews
represent”, so frequently used in
Nazi Germany, for my tastes. Don’t
get me wrong I am not for a second
suggesting that there is a direct
comparison, or that Lynas has any-
thing even close to Nazi tendencies,
only that we must be vigilant to such
trends in the media if we are to take
our lessons from the past.

Lower bar prices?
A Wednesday evening in da Vinci’s - price cuts are in the works, according to Jon Matthews’ letter
Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose anti-Communist ‘witchhunt’ capitalised on the American public’s fear
of communism - are governments and the media now using Islam as their scapegoat?
