Responses to

response - I think
Dear Sir,
I wish to express my objection
to Samuel Lynus’ offensive com-
ments in last week’s Felix, where
the Prophet Muhammad, may the
peace and blessings of God be upon
him, was described as being “men-
tally ill”.
Even though I do not agree with
Mr Lynus’ views on Islam, I do not
think it unreasonable to question
and debate others’ views; however,
I do think it unreasonable and in-
conducive to fruitful discussion to
say such remarks, especially about
a man revered so highly by over 1
billion people around the world.

Dear Andy,
Please note the complaint from
one of the Beit Residents about
the recent letter in Felix which was
clearly offensive to Muslims. While
I recognise your wish to publish let-
ters freely, I support this complaint
- in my opinion publishing material
which is designed to be religiously
offensive and inflammatory is ir-
responsible and beneath your nor-
mally high editorial standards.
Regards,
Neil Mcintyre
Warden of Beit Hall
The letter from the Beit resident:
In the recent Felix issue there are
potentially offensive remarks about
our prophet in letters to editor. I am
very much disturbed by these and
so will be the Muslim community as
this word will spread.
Please take notice of the situa-
tion if you have the authority to do
something about this.
Regards
Umar Bhatti

Andy Sykes replies,
I felt these two letters deserved
a separate response to the many
missives I received on this subject,
because they deal with Mr Lynas’
right to speak his mind.
While you may not agree with Mr
Lynas’ assertion that Muhammed
was mentally ill, it is his opinion
and he has a right to express it. Of
course it’s imflammatory and of-
fensive to those that don’t share his
views, but that isn’t the point. The
point is that, in this country, eve-
ryone has a right to free speech un-
less they use their speech to incite
violence or hatred of a particular
group or person. He didn’t do this.
And to you, Mr Dingle, the
number of people that revere a giv-
en person has absolutely no effect
on what you should be able to say
about that person.
If we were to censor people on the
grounds that their views were of-
fensive to others, we’d be heading
down a dark path. To paraphrase
an oft-used maxim: you may not
agree with what Mr Lynas said,
but you should accept his right to
say it.
Dear Sir,
This is mind boggling. Every time
I open Felix, or any other newspa-
per for that matter, there are nu-
merous articles on Muslims that
avoid the most important ques-
tions such as why Muslims are the
most underprivileged and poverty-
stricken segment of British society,
or why Muslims are the least likely
to be given the best opportunities.
These are important questions that
society needs to address to itself if
it truly believes in equal opportuni-
ties and values tolerance.
Instead, the focus is incessantly
on stale arguments about banning
theveil;cartoons;orthePope. Okay,
fair enough, in these cases freedom
speech or multiculturalism may
be identified as the core issue, but
when I look at the “argument about
Islam that’s been raging” within Fe-
lix (as referred to by Andy Sykes),
I can actually see no argument on
Islam! I only see arguments on his-
tory, or wide-sweeping statements
on Islam with no basis.
Mr Frison for example makes
competent discussion about inter-
preting history, but doesn’t give any
valid sources for his claims. Moreo-
ver, I fail to see how he jumps to the
conclusion that Saad is “a warmon-
gering, completely biased”, “ag-
gressive” and “immoral” Muslim
just because he has presented his
opinion using well-defined Western
and European sources!
However, I don’t understand Mr
Lynas’ response at all! While the
two letters addressed to him had
substance to them, and even though
the editor breached the writers’
trust by providing Mr Lynas the let-
ters outside the paper more than
a week before this response was
produced, Mr Lynas has only man-
aged to come back with what could
be at best described as incoherent
ramblings of a racist or at worst
hysterical propaganda. Therefore,
Mr Lynas, please go back to GCSE
English and learn how to construct
an argument before you masquer-
ade yourself as a saviour of the ill-
informed, when in fact you yourself
are the most ill-informed, and are
A response to
last week’s
editorial
not willing to learn anything about
that which you wish to defame.
It most certainly doesn’t help
when Felix, which is meant to be a
responsible newspaper, simultane-
ously reports an absurd 6 year old
rumour from a non-Imperial source
about an ‘Imperial Islamic death
squad’ as fact – as if such a thing
could actually exist. Or even when
it reports an honest attempt at de-
fending civil rights through the
perfectly conventional Union Coun-
cil route as being “under controver-
sial circumstances and allegations
of intimidation” without giving any
evidence to support its claim. I am
of course referring to the report
in the last issue about the Union’s
decision to support the innocent
Babar Ahmed’s appeal to extradi-
tion to a brutal and inhumane US
regime.
So, in summary, it is evident
that you Mr. Sykes are proud to be
‘wielding the mighty organ’, but
please do not get so carried away
with being fashionably politically
incorrect that you are incorrect al-
together. Hence, please appreciate
your huge responsibility and please
give us something meaningful and
truthful to discuss.

Ammar Waraich
Andy Sykes replies,
Politically incorrect? Hmm. I’ll
deal with that when I’ve discussed
some of false assumptions you’ve
made in your letter.
Firstly, there have been a lot of
replies and counter-replies to Mr
Lynas’ first article, refuting or sup-
porting his points. I’d call that an
argument, and judging by the pas-
sions it has stirred up, I feel justi-
fied in referring to it as ‘raging’.
Secondly, you make a woefully
false assumption that I “breached
the writers’ trust”. This is simply
not the case. I have an obligation to
ensure that if I am to publish a let-
ter attacking an individual, I allow
that individual right of reply, as
laid down in the Press Complaints
Commission’s Code of Practice
as well as Felix’s constitution. I
gave Mr Lynas right to reply, and
showed him the content of the let-
ters discussing him.
Thirdly, the “Imperial Islamic
death squad” statement was so
ridiculous I felt that any astute
reader would also find it ridicu-
lous. The comment was prompted
not by, as you put it, a six year old
source, but by Imam Musa Adma-
ni on Newnight a few weeks ago.
He did not use the term “Islamic
death squad”; what he did relate
was a story whereby a student ap-
proached him, and said: “Imam, I
came to inform you of something ...
a group from Imperial College are
coming to kill you tomorrow.”
Fourthly, while I absolutely sup-
port the attempt by Colin Smith
