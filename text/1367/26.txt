I, Gamer
I
mistakenly signed up to
the video game voters
network a while back, not
realising that they were
American only, and ad-
ditionally did very little indeed.
The original idea was great – if
gamers get democratically in-
volved, they can help change
their image. But at the end of
the day, it boils down to no-one
really caring about “the im-
age”. Rock music went through
far worse periods of unpopular-
ity than being a target on the
Daily Mail’s slow news day.
I think it also underlines
the fact that we can be a bit
hypocritical sometimes too.
As much as we bemoan the
business policies of Electronic
Arts, no-one ever has the con-
viction to really boycott them
en masse. Is it because they’ve
used money to create a power-
ful monopoly over the market?
Or is it simply that we’d rather
play games than get bogged
down in protests and politics?
A bit of both? Maybe.
But maybe it’s just that gam-
ers don’t know what they want
any more. There was a time
when we didn’t need to know –
games were games, and you ei-
ther played them or you didn’t.
That’s a large contributor to a
game’s status as “classic” – not
just good design, but a lack of
any real alternative.
So now that the Wii has final-
ly made its way to these shores
(pulling off the most impressive
worldwide release out of all the
next-gen consoles) are we re-
ally sure we want it after all?
The Wiimote isn’t going to be
an extension of your arm, and
the virtual console isn’t going
to be a cheap one-way ticket to
retro heaven. Have we really
thought abut what next-gen
means, or are we letting Nin-
tendo play the gimmick card
one time too many?
It seems unlikely that the
Wii will beat the marketing
machines of Sony and Micro-
soft, whatever happens, but
both sides of Felix’s argument
this week note the same thing
– innovation, gimmicky or not,
is required to keep the game
alive. So whether you think
we’re being played for fools,
or whether Nintendo is finally
going to take a risk that pays
off, one thing seems certain
– change means that someone
is thinking, for better or worse.
And if that doesn’t deserve be-
ing given another chance four
years from now, then nor does
FIFA.
Wii’ll be back in January.
Fresh out of good puns though.

You can’t handle the truth!
T
here’s something very
strange about people.
Individually they all
know, deep down, that
Grim Fandango was
a fantastic game, that Radiohead
is whiny shite, and that Jude Law
is as attractive as rotting sewage
in a man thong. But get enough of
them together, and by god you can
be sure they’ll be lapping up the OK
Computer Special Edition, and buy-
ing the Scratch n’ Sniff Jude calen-
dars by the bucketload.
And it’s not that they’re buying
rubbish that’s the problem. It’s
the disturbing, twisted pleasure
they seem to get from purchasing
something that they know is utterly
terrible. A question for you holier-
than-thou readers sitting on the
prosecution bench – if I gave you
the chance to make a ridiculous
sum of money out of this simple fact
about shoppers, do you really think
you’d turn it down?
Worse than this though – if you
weren’t even gamers, if you were
businessmen first and foremost?
What then? Would you feel any
guilt? Because there’s a lot wrong
in Electronic Arts’ past, but the
most common criticism – that they
tend to churn out the same rubbish
over and over just to make money
– isn’t much of a criticism when you
stop looking at them as a games
publisher with a Markey share
and PR issues, and start looking at
them as something much simpler
– a stock market value, and a six-
month performance graph.
Fine, you can’t absolve every busi-
nessman of responsibility to the
markets, but let’s make that point
again before we go any further, just
so everyone is clear on it – The Sims
has sold, to date, more than sixteen
million copies. You don’t need to
know how good or bad a game is to
work out that an expansion pack is
a good business move.
So if you really want to get EA
behind bars with an empty bank
balance, you’ll need to get deeper
within the problem. Why do peo-
ple hate EA? Because they think
they’re ruining “the Industry”.
It’s true that EA do themselves
no favours in the press department.
When they make the news it either
involves the phrase “hostile takeo-
ver” or “employee conditions”, and
they have acquired a large number
of development houses in the past,
it’s true. At a recent presentation to
Imperial’s computing department,
Rajan Tande, a lead programmer at
Electronic Arts, said “I think they
probably do deserve a lot of [the
bad press]. But it’s also out of pro-
portion.” In many cases, Electronic
Arts has saved development houses
from collapse, and brought together
more effective groups of designers
– long working hours are a fact of
life for any games programmer. But
hey, it’s easy to kick a multinational
media corporation when it’s down.
A quite prominent example is
their purchasing and liquidation of
Westwood Studios. Many key fig-
ures left the studio after EA took
the group from Virgin in the nine-
ties – but those that stayed went on
to create an award-winning sequel
to Red Alert, and then went on to
form EA Los Angeles with Dream-
works – a team that now has a
track record including much of the
Medal of Honor series, The Battle
For Middle Earth and Command
and Conquer 3. Did they break the
magic of a well-oiled development
studio, or did they find a new way to
Bigger kids make you hate them. Michael Cook in search of (E)A Few Good Men
Exhibits A-C : Maxis, Will Wright, and The Sims franchise
In the late eighties, Will Wright got
together with Jeff Braun and pub-
lished a game called SimCity. It
was a huge hit, spawning a 1993 se-
quel and securing both Wright and
the Sim brand as defining moments
in gaming history to date.
However, the franchise began to
decline in the mid-nineties. Games
such as SimCopter, though ambi-
tious in some ways, failed to meet
well with the market, and the com-
pany began to run into trouble.
In 1997, Electronic Arts
complete the acquisition
of the Maxis brand, al-
lowing them to
give direction
and funding to
a development
house that
they knew had poten-
tial. Will Wright wasn’t
moved around, the com-
pany wasn’t liquidated, and until
the release of The Sims 2: Pets, the
Maxis brand remained in all of
their games.
Electronic Arts didn’t
just see potential in
Maxis itself - they
saw potential in
the structure of
Maxis, in the peo-
ple working in it.
Will Wright is consid-
ered as one of the leading lights
in game design today, and The
Sims has changed the face of both
use the talent, giving a chance to a
team that wanted to stay isometric
with Red Alert 2, even though the
pressure was on to move to 3D?
And if you think Electronic Arts
have got worse since then, then
fast-forward to 2002 when a long
process of lawsuits began between
Sierra (later Vivendi Universal)
and Valve Software began, begin-
ning over a simple argument about
license selling, and ending up with
Vivendi attempting to wrench con-
trol of the Half-Life intellectual
property from Valve. Evil corpora-
tions attempting to take control of
franchises from developers? This
sounds familiar. But Electronic
Arts stepped into the ensuing chaos
and signed a deal to publish Valve
games on the high-street for the
next few years. No asset-stripping.
No design breaking. Just a mutual
co-operation that both companies
benefited from without either tak-
ing any financial hit.
Why did Electronic Arts agree to
step in and publish the games? For
the money? The high-street version
wasn’t in huge demand, and helping
out Valve – a company that has now
used Steam to rival EA as a games
distributor – doesn’t seem like
fantastic business sense from the
company whose stock value rose by
300% in the first year of floatation.
And yet, at the same time, it just
doesn’t feel all that likely that they
were just really big fans of Gordon
Freeman. Maybe EA saw what was
good for the market, for the indus-
try, and decided to do it?
Or would that be too human a
move for you all to handle? The de-
fence rests.
Would Half-Life 2 have been released if Valve had lost to Vivendi and EA hadn’t stepped in to publish?
casual gaming and simulation gam-
ing forever. Could this have gone
on without Electronic Arts’s power
and funding? It doesn’t seem very
likely.
And while many gamers would
rather not have The Sims on shop
shelves, far more are looking for-
ward to Wright’s 2007 release,
Spore. Great ideas only go so far
– Electronic Arts has the power to
prop up and support what they see
as good gaming.
