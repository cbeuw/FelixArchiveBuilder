E
lectronic Arts has over
twenty-four years grown
to be the largest third-
party software publisher
in the world, producing
some of the most recognisable titles
in the industry: The Sims, Medal of
Honor, Battlefield 2, and the FIFA
series to name but a few. However,
despite its apparent popularity, it
has achieved its position through
a series of hostile market practices
and is now abusing its position for
its own short-term success – possi-
bly putting the future of the entire
industry in jeapordy.
EA pursues an extremely aggres-
sive policy of securing intellectual
property rights to popular fran-
chises. This often takes the form
of exlcusive deals with sports gov-
erning bodies – for example, FIFA
and the NFL or film studios – EA
holds the rights to all Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter films, but
also involves buying up smaller de-
velopment studios purely for their
trademark games. Over the years
EA has purchased Maxis (Sim City
and The Sims), Westwood Studios
(Command and Conquer series),
and Origin (Ultima and Ultima On-
line), often disbanding the studios
and leaving understaffed teams to
produce poor-quality sequels.
These sequels are the core of EA’s
current business plan. So many of
its franchises are based on house-
hold names that represent once-
good games: The Sims, Need For
Speed, Ultima and Command and
Conquer have all been fantastic in
their time, but are now burdened
with a slew of cheap follow-ups. The
Sims 2 is now accompanied by no
less than nine add-on packs, and
C&C: Generals pales in compari-
son both to its genre contemparies,
such as Act of War: Direct Action,
and even its predecessor in C&C:
Red Alert 2. These sequels and
add-ons typically feature margin-
ally improved graphics to keep up
to date with the latest hardware,
the occasional new feature (al-
though not generally fixes for bugs
or exploits), and updated artwork
– whether that be new furniture for
The Sims, or this season’s team kits
for sports games.
The most crucial element of this
is their ultimatum: When a yearly
update is released, support is im-
mediately pulled for the previous
version. Microsoft still release
security updates for previous ver-
sions of Windows, yet owners of
EA’s FIFA World Cup 2006 will not
be seeing any updates now that
FIFA 2007 is out – even though it
was released only six months ago.
Additionally, multiplayer game
servers are switched off, disabling
what for many is the best part of
a game, and these combined ef-
fectively forces people to upgrade
every single year.
Even Battlefield 2, with its ad-
mittedly fantastic ranking system,
faces discontinuation in the face of
Battlefield 2142 – despite the fact
that it has retained most of its play-
erbase due to its contemporary set-
ting and realistic gameplay.
EA’s most recent “crime” involves
the Xbox 360 Marketplace. On older
consoles, and on the PC, extra fea-
tures in games are unlocked by
either completing objectives or en-
tering cheat codes. However, on the
Xbox 360, players are forced to pay
small amounts (£1-2) for each fea-
ture, leading many to accuse EA of
selling incomplete games, almost
conning people into handing over
far more than their original £40.
So how does Electronic Arts get
away with this? The answer to this
is simple: Their exclusive licences
give them a dominance of so many
areas of gaming, effectively giv-
ing them a monopoly in individual
genres. Games based on Harry
Potter or The Lord of the Rings
are practically guaranteed to sell,
regardless of review scores or the
With the Wii now on the shelves,
the release schedules are erupt-
ing with quality launch titles that
were held back, as well as the
dregs of the Christmas launch
window. The Wii hits the UK with
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
Princess, Red Steel, Wii Sports,
and Wii Play all finding their way,
if all goes to plan, to the EU region
for launch.
Zelda has been described as “by
far the best Zelda made”, and de-
spite the revised control system,
is still going to be a key release
game for the Wii. If you’ve liked
it in the past – even if you haven’t
liked it in the past – the new Zelda
is worth a look.
Red Steel, however, gained al-
most as much press coverage as
Twilight Princess after it released
enough press statements and ex-
plained just how its control sys-
tem would work. By controlling a
gun or a katana with the Wiimote/
Nunchuk system, you’re given an
unprecedented control over what
you can do.
But like all Wii titles, don’t ex-
pect to start busting moves like
Kill Bill on a sugar rush – you’ll
need to get used to the new con-
trol system before you can start
disarming enemies instead of lop-
ping bits off them.
You’ll find Wii Sports bundled
with the console itself, and if you
buy Wii Play at release you should
get a second Wiimote with it, mak-
ing the entire package far more
multiplayer-friendly for the festive
season.
Sports and Play are the best
way to show off what the Wii can
currently do – Zelda is a solid
adventure, and Red Steel has a
great visual appeal, but for sheer
variety and colourful Nintendo
inventiveness, the Wii range of ti-
tles are probably the games to be
looking for first and foremost this
Christmas.
If you’re not a Wii player, then
there’s still other games being re-
leased, but you might find that the
best are long released. Captain
Scarlet for the PS2? Ghost Recon
for the 360?
It’s the dregs. Like that cheap
Christmas chocolate you find in
a Disney advent calendar, you’re
into Christmas now whether you
like it or not. Best to save for the
new year.
Unreal Tournament 2007’s com-
ing, after all …
Out now
Hold it! Objection, m’lud!
Electronic Arts don’t deserve sympathy nor money, explains James Freedman
James Freedman, at the weekend. If only all journalism was this fun
actual quality of the game. Their
pragmatic mindset prompts them
to save money by not bothering to
develop a high-quality game – to
them, it is simply the numbers that
matter. Many of their games sell on
the success of predecessors – Com-
mand and Conquer, for example,
and many prey on the ultimate of
all salespersons – the screaming
child. Every add-on for The Sims,
is of course, a must have for every
young fan, regardless of their mini-
mal addition to gameplay. EA have
also been known to stifle user-gen-
erated content – particularly in the
case of Battlefield 2 – perhaps in the
belief that (contrary to the obvious
success of Half-Life’s modifiability
with Counter-Strike) the scarcity of
additional replayability provided by
this will increase the sales of their
rushed add-ons and sequels.
At the end of the day, Electronic
Arts can get away with all this be-
cause the gaming community is,
in general, fickle. Most potential
customers will be swayed by a few
stunning screenshots and the lat-
est season’s player stats, and this
renders the hardcore community’s
only real option – voting by wallet
– powerless.
Even those who would like to take
a stand will find themselves grudg-
inly purchasing the latest game
in a franchise – after all, it may be
shoddy, but it is apparently better
than the nothing EA are offering as
an alternative.
Exhibits D-F : Battlefield 2, EA Sports, and online support
When you buy a game, you’re told
in almost every way possible that
you’re bound by legal and moral
obligations to play the game once
a day, every day, alone, where no-
one else can so much as hear it,
and not to tell anyone else you own
the game and god forbid you should
lend the game to anyone without a
copy themselves.
Of course, when it comes to what
you can expect, they couldn’t give
a toss. Electronic Arts launch a
game, make claims as to
what they’re going to do
in the future, and then
sometimes do them.
In the past, it didn’t
matter all that much
if EA forgot about the
game. You missed
out on a patch, or an
expansion pack you
didn’t want anyway.
But when most of the
game’s draw is an online
mode, and when you’re
playing on a console that
completely relies on
EA to keep the serv-
ice going, it hardly
seems fair that the
ones profiting from
you purchasing
games are also the
ones with the button
that switches off the
very thing you bought the
game for in the first place.
Red Steel - Pow! Zap! Kaching!
It’s been a long time coming.
It is, of course. It’s plastered all
over the EULA - you remember, it’s
the thing you scroll down very fast
whilst chuckling during installation
or, if you’re a console gamer, the
lines of text that flash on the screen
for a fraction of a second before
startup.
But legal documents don’t ex-
cuse what is, essentially, wringing
money out of gamers for something
they’ve already bought countless
times before.
