Fairytales, fauns, and Franco’s fascists
Pan’s Labyrinth – brutal, cruel, innocent, and unnervingly beautiful. A fairytale fit for the the Brothers Grimm
It says a lot about a film when the
reviewer’s only real problem lies
in its marketing. Pan’s Labyrinth,
Guillermo del Toro’s latest work,
has suffered somewhat from being
trailed as a surrealist fantasy along
the lines of Alice in Wonderland, The
Dark Crystal, and the like. Whilst
this is obviously not wholly without
basis, the surreal elements are few
and far between. The majority of the
story is firmly based in reality, con-
cerningresistanceagainstFranco’s
fascist regime in the countryside of
post-civil war Spain. Furthermore,
the Wonderlandesque diversions
are not the light-hearted escapism
one might expect, but every bit as
brutal and unforgiving as the real
world. Rather than the historical
context providing a backdrop for a
straightforward fantasy tale, is is
the fanstastic aspects which frame
a sober tale of conflict.
As with so many tales following
the Wonderland archetype, the
story concerns a young girl, Ofelia,
somewhat neglected by her family:
her expectant mother, too distract-
ed by her problematic pregnancy
to pay much attention to Ofelia;
and her new husband, the sadistic
Captain Vidal in the ‘wicked step-
mother’ role: concerned neither for
his wife nor stepdaughter, but only
for his as-yet unborn son. While
Ofelia’s mother is laid up in bed and
Captain Vidal combs the country-
side for rebels, Ofelia herself is left
to explore the surrounding area.
Nearby she finds the eponymous
labyrinth, at the heart of which
reasides a fawn who, in the nature
of these things, sets her certain
tasks.
The body of the film alternates be-
tween the continuing guerilla war
between the anti-fascist resistance
and Captain Vidal’s troops, and
Ofelia’s semi-Herculean undertak-
ings; never settling for too long on
any one plot strand. This constant
shifting between grim reality and
what could be called a Grimm re-
ality serves to unsettle the viewer
even further than the strands do
individually. While the contrast is
sometimes jarring, it never feels
as though the two sides to the story
are at odds, and the parallels be-
tween the historical and folkloric
elements are suitably highlighted,
especially when the stories run
back into each other.
There are a few minor irritations,
however - the use of folklore occa-
sionally drifts into cliché at the ex-
pense of characterisation and not
a little goodwill on the part of the
audience. It is generally held that
the protagonist will receive a dire
warning and will fail to heed it, and
here is no exception, but the man-
ner in which it unfolds is utterly out
of character, especially after the
warning had been very deliberately
repeated beforehand and again at
the time. Perhaps the irritation lies
more with the anticipation of the
failing than with the act itself, and
that its inevitability is the source of
the problem rather mere predict-
ability. Regardless, it proves a dis-
traction from an otherwise highly
immersing film, drawing the viewer
away from its carefully constructed
world.
Del Toro’s use of imagery and
folklore runs throughout his work,
though nowhere is it quite so pro-
nounced as here. Motifs from his
previous films are instantly recog-
nisable: most notably the labyrinth
itself echoes a similar construction
in his unfairly maligned Hellboy, as
do many of the creatures which in-
habit the film. This serves to high-
light their differences all the more

- whilst his most recent English lan-
guage films have been contempo-
rary urban works, Pan’s Labyrinth
is a return to the historical settings
of his earlier works: particularly
The Devil’s Backbone - also set in
the aftermath of the Spanish civil
war and to which it forms some-
thing of a thematic sequel. It too
eschews any urban trappings for
a wholly rural setting, lending the
work a deeply organic feel. The cin-
ematography plays this aspect up
to its fullest, and everything from
the most mundane clearing to the
grandiose world briefly glimpsed at
points throughout the film are stun-
ning in their realisation.
For all its visual splendour how-
ever, this is a film about barbarism
and intense cruelty. Made manifest
in Vidal and some of his more eso-
teric brethren, there are sequences
of severe brutality that feel cal-
culated to shock and make the
experience deeply uncomfortable
and unsettling. At points it even
approaches the realm of the genu-
inely harrowing. But for all this, it is
a thoroughly entertaining film - its
inconsistencies and incongruities
lend it even greater texture, and
while it wants for humour, it never
descends to the bleak. Sober, but
never depressing. A deeply reward-
ing film.
