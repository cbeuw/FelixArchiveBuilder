M
erry Christmas
all! Although
we’re not quite
there yet, this will
be my last night-
life page, since Greg gets out of
rehab in time for the first issue
of next term. Maybe I will dust off
my pen in the new year and write
some reviews for a change, but
otherwise this might be the last
you ever hear of me.
I may be saying goodbye, but on
Friday night I welcomed And Did
We Mention Our Disco? back to a
regular spot in London for their
now monthly parties. Despite a
slightly disappointing venue (a
rather dingy part of London Met-
ropolitan University student un-
ion, tucked away near Aldgate),
they are still doing their best to
attract some very fine DJs and
they certainly need no help at-
tracting a large crowd of people to
hear them play. Good music and a
good atmosphere made for an en-
tertaining clubnight, if not quite as
good as back in the good old days
at Plastic People.
That’s enough of that pseudo-
review anyway. All that remains
is for me to wish you all a delight-
ful holiday, whether or not your
entertainment occurs during the
night time.

Follow the bubbles to... King’s Cross
Stood, quite cold (freezing my arse
off, more accurately), on Penton-
ville Road, I turn to my associate,
who has led us out of this particu-
lar exit of King’s Cross. We’re in a
rush, the place starts charging in a
mere twenty minutes, and we can
ill afford to head in the wrong direc-
tion. He contemplates the situation,
peruses a choice few signs, and
finally points to the right. Before I
can decide whether to listen to him,
I look to the left, and swear I can
see snow falling. I gape wide-eyed
at the spectacle from above, be-
cause that’s definitely not snow. My
hand lingers weakly as I point to the
machine attached to the forth floor
of the building next to us, spreading
bubbles over the entire street, and
urgently shake his shoulder. The in-
vites said: “Follow the bubbles”.
Buttoned Down Disco has come
a long way since I last visited prop-
erly, this time last year, when it
was hosted at The Purple Turtle,
in Camden. For a start, Scala is a
significantly larger venue, and sec-
ondly, there were a lot more people.
There were three main rooms, with
innumerable corridors and sub-
rooms, which at first can be bewil-
dering. When you first enter, the
main bar lies in front of you, and
to the right is a ponderously large
staircase that leads right the way
up to the top of the venue.
The main bar is the first room,
with the formidably large cloak-
room queue, and a small, seeming-
ly pointless, dance floor in its own
room on the side. I say pointless,
it wasn’t until a few hours/drinks
later that I discovered what a sim-
ply joyful little place it is. Firstly, the
room has fantastic acoustics, and
perhaps more importantly, two op-
posing walls are each flanked with
a line of square lights, that flash in
different, hypnotising colours (think
Close Encounters of The Third
Kind). Disappointingly, this little
joyhole was also terribly sparse
throughout the night, which I find
desperately ironic considering that
the music was also the most obvi-
ously danceable, being a variety of
glitchy electropop (played by the
lovely Speakerboxx DJs), which the
kids who visit Trash and Our Disco
enjoy so much these days.
Corridors run from each of the
other rooms that lead onto the main
room, a converted cinema, with a
large stage and the usual array of
balconies dotted around the place.
The main room has Dollyrocker,
the resident Buttoned Down Disco
So it’s finally (nearly) Christmas,
and since this is the last issue of
term, we’re going to assume that
the holidays have already started,
unless you are actually reading this
issue of Felix on the last day of term
in which case it will be true that the
holidays have started, but it’s fairly
unlikely that there will be any cop-
ies of Felix left around campus by
that time, considering last week I
saw a bunch of rugby/football/pub-
lic-school types destroying about 50
copies of our beloved paper in Beit
Quad after an all night lager down-
ing session in the Union Bar. If the
culprits are reading this, I’ll have
you know that each copy of Felix
now costs £58 to print since we’ve
joined the NUS (as opposed to 20p
before) I have no evidence support-
ing this fact, but it’s probably true.
Anyway, the point of this article is
to act as a guide to the festive sea-
son around this lovely town other-
wise known as London. Of course,
as usual - we’ve got a wonderful
competition prize for you people
to win in this issue, so you could
always consider checking that out,
but unfortunately Felix does not yet
exert enough influence to give away
prizes of tickets for every single
event in the capital, so we’re going
to give you a few ideas as to where
some of your beloved Nightlife team
will be visiting this holiday.
First of all, let’s start with Christ-
mas parties, since that comes first
chronologically. Last years Trash
mailing list party was great, which
can only mean one thing: This year
will be even better. It’s a mailing
list member only event, so if you
want to go – make sure you sign up
on the website. Decent music, the
smell of hairspray, fashionistas ga-
lore, a late licence open until 6am
and free punch for everyone, what
more could you want? Admission
was free last year, and it most likely
will be this year too. Check their
website for a host of other Christ-
mas events they’ve got organised.
Another great bet is the Aftersk-
ool Christmas party on the 18th De-
cember. It’s a great night out, loads
of people are dressed up and they
give away presents to everyone!
Last year I was given two amaz-
ing battery powered candles, two
plastic aeroplanes, 3 bouncy balls
(which smell really nice), a big box
of chocolates, 12 mince pies and
a miniature green rugby ball! Of
course, the drinks are super cheap,
and the music is great too, which is
also a bonus. Definitely the friendli-
est Christmas party I’ve ever been
to. The Panic! Christmas party is
always worth a try too, so you could
check that out if you can’t make any
of the other dates I’ve mentioned.
New Years Eve is next, and as-
suming you haven’t decided to study
on this wonderful excuse to go out
and get completely hammered and
wake up having spent your entire
student loan and overdraft, then
you’ll want to be going to some su-
per badass ultra cool mega-party.
If you like hard dance then we sug-
gest Heat NYE at the Brixton Acad-
emy (see our competition a bit fur-
ther down the page to win tickets).
At 4000 capacity is should be pretty
awesome, and you’ll be sure that
when you leave the club at noon the
next day with happy memories, gi-
ant pupils, wobbly legs and 4 new
best mates you won’t regret going
DJ, playing a mix of popular elec-
tro and danceable alternative rock,
Pixies, Le Tigre, Strokes, Soulwax
and everything else you would ex-
pect from Buttoned Down Disco,
really.
I mentioned a staircase off to the
right, I think. It leads off right to
the top of the venue, where there is
another room, big enough to stand
on its own as a club. Playing in here
were the impressively named Pi-
rate Soundsystem, although one
questions the glorification of piracy;
if you ask me, raping and pillaging
is not something to be proud about,
but there’s no telling some people).
Their music was a bit more on the
hip hop and funky side of things, al-
though, if memory recalls correctly,
still quite electronic at times.
Near to this was my favourite
room – the chillout room. Just above
the main room, with magic sound
reducing glass, comfortable leather
chairs, and these odd stepped floor
things on the side that you can sit
up on (a while after sitting on one
of the embedded lights, it was quite
surprising to look down and notice
that light was shining out of my
arse). I must admit that this is the
kind of place a lot of clubs could do
with, somewhere where the volume
is just right, you can converse to
people freely, yet the music from
below is still distinctly audible.
Anyway, here’s the clincher, do
I really honestly approve? Well,
frankly, I have had an awful lot of
fun both times I’ve visited, and the
crowd is an unusually friendly one,
and they do have great choice in
venues. However, it is very difficult
to distinguish the clubnight from
the club itself in this case, because
of the nature of Buttoned Down
Disco – it’s a secret nightclub, so it
changes venue sporadically around
London (by the way, you sign up
for invites at buttoneddowndisco.
com). So that means it is really
quite a game of pot luck, because
it changes every different club that
they hire. I have to say, Scala was
impressive though, and there’s no
shortage of regulars, plus the mu-
sic is sublime.
There’s something for everyone
at their large events, as this event
showed – there was live MCing
at this event in the upper room,
so alongside the traditional elec-
tronica and indie selection there
was also a hiphop flavour, which
is astoundingly unusual in my ex-
perience, as let’s be honest, the
crowds don’t mix particularly often!
Considering their nights are free,
it’s hard to disapprove, although I
warn somewhat about the sporadic
nature of the place – each night is
different than the last!
Matt ‘The Hat’ Long
for one second. Of course, if that’s
not your thing then there are plenty
of other events going.
This year, Afterskool team up
with White Heat to deliver what can
only be an amazing New Years Eve
party. As they put it you’ll be hav-
ing a spectacularly sexy 6 1/2 hour
joyride, starting at 9.30pm, tearing
into the year 2007 at midnight, then
bursting out onto the streets at 4am
with more sweets, balloons, glow
sticks and party poppers en route
than is legal. Well I’m sold. Another
good bet is Fabric New Years Eve,
the wonderful French duo Justice
will be DJing room two, along with
Craig Richards and Terry Francis
headlining the main room.
As is the case with most New
Years Eve parties, they will all be
extremely popular, so if you’ve real-
ly got your heart set on going some-
where, we suggest you buy your
tickets far in advance, or you’ll end
up spending your evening standing
in the street queuing up for entry
to some hell-hole like Walkabout,
or paying three times more to get
in where you actually want to go.
Also, expect to spend money, lots of
money.
So, that’s the end of this point-
less guide, and if you’ve read this
far then I congratulate you on hav-
ing so little else to do, but hopefully
it’ll have given you a few ideas as
to what you might do, or at least
prompt you to organise something
of your own. Incidentally, in totally
unrelated matters, Alex will be re-
signing his position as temporary
Nightlife editor after this issue and
I will be rejoining the ranks of the
Felix team to replace him, so happy
Christmas everyone and I look for-
ward to writing more diatribes for
the reading pleasure of all my love-
ly readers in the New Year.
You could always go and watch the London Eye catch fire
Competition
For our final competition of 2006,
you could win a pair of tickets to one
of the biggest new year’s eve par-
ties in London, HeatNYE. We are
giving away a pair of tickets (worth
£30 each) for the bash on Sunday
the 31st of December hosted by
HeatUK and The Gallery at Brixton
Academy.
This is their 5th year running and
with 4 arenas and up to 30 DJs, this
promises to be an entertaining way
to pass the time on new year’s eve
this year. The midnight countdown,
featuring an impressive display of
pyrotechnics, is reason enough to
go, even without the line-up featur-
ing such names as Above & Beyond,
Tall Paul and Rob Tissera (Kiss-
dafunk) along with many more big
name acts.
If this sounds tempting. just send
us an email as usual to the address
at the top of the page. Good luck!
