Pears, herbs, and polonium 210
It is hard to commentate on the
shady underworld of international
espionage and secrets. An ex-Rus-
sian spy who co-authored the book
Blowing up Russia: Terror from
Within is murdered with a poison
unfamiliar to the natural world.
His drawn-out death implicated
suspects among the country’s dip-
lomatic and secret services, whilst
Vlad et al, wrapped in furs and twid-
dling their Faberge eggs surround-
ed by watchful Rokotov portraits in
one of the many gilded rooms of the
Kremlin, calling the incident ‘unfor-
tunate’ along with a whole host of
other inoffensive adjectives.
With a trail of radiation leading all
the way to Moscow, was it Putin who
ordered the unfortunate’s death?
But, as many commentators con-
vincingly point out, is Putin foolish
enough to have someone murdered
so publicly? Or perhaps it was, as
the official line goes, a small part in
a larger picture trying to discredit
Russia? Officials from the ex-com-
munist state at one point indicted
London resident Boris Berezovsky,
an exiled billionaire and critic of
Vladimir Putin. Traces of the now
notorious substance were found at
his offices in Mayfair last Monday.
It could simply be a matter of per-
sonal revenge, though the culprit
would have required access to ma-
terials found only in reactors.
There are so many questions
that will almost certainly never be
answered. Could Litvinenko have
stumbled upon a secret organisa-
tion run by lizard people who con-
trol the minds of world leaders?
The big question on everybody’s
lips around the world must be “so
what’s Tony going to do about it
all?”. Months from retirement
(hours if we are to believe every-
thing written in the press these
days), will the British Prime Minis-
ter stand up for a man who risked,
and ultimately gave, his life for a
cause he called ‘noble’? Surely ten-
sions and suspicions between the
old cold war enemies must have
worsened?
According to the larger picture,
that course of action seems desper-
ately unlikely, despite Mr Blair say-
ing last Tuesday that “no diplomatic
or political barrier” will hamper in-
vestigations. Blair has only spoken
generously of his Russian counter-
part, and publicly supports Russia’s
private war on terror in Chechnya.
Even George Bush, he who over-
sees the occupation (or liberation
Sign Britain away
The UK’s highest court ruled last
week that two British men (one a
former employee of Imperial Col-
lege) may be extradited to the
United States. The court did not im-
mediately rule on whether the two
men could appeal the decision to
the House of Lords, Britain’s high-
est tribunal.
If certification is not given by the
High Court, then the appeal stage
to the House of Lords will not go
ahead. After that extradition is
a real possibility within a short
space of time, as previous cases
have shown. On the other hand, if
permitted, the legal team will have
14 days to argue over points of law
surrounding the extradition deci-
sion, namely those concerning Mili-
tary Detention and Rendition.
Failing that, the last appeal stage
is to the European Court of Human
Rights. In both cases, a lower court
judge allowed extradition after re-
ceiving assurances from US author-
ities that they would not seek the
death penalty, put the men before
military tribunals or declare them
“enemy combatants”. This coming
from the government that brought
you the likes of the illegal war in
Iraq, the extra-judicial procedure of
Extraordinary Rendition, the pic-
tures from Abu Ghraib prison and
the injustices of the Guantanamo
Bay concentration camp.
The lawyer for both men, Edward
if you swing that way) of a country
now subject to one hundred plus in-
cidents per day of murder, rape and
kidnap, described the conflict in the
near east region as “chaotic”. Per-
haps Tony’s stance has something
to do with Britain’s growing de-
pendence on petroleum imports, or
perhaps not. Maybe Tony is looking
on pro-Putin Gerhard Schroeder’s
appointment to the board of direc-
tors of Gazprom on the day of his
election defeat as a promising sign
of things to come, or maybe not.
However Mr Blair decides to navi-
gate this political minefield though,
what is clear is how cheesed off the
Kremlin is about the publicity an
otherwise discreet matter has re-
ceived; the embassy has allegedly
vented their anger at the cabinet
for not imposing an executive deci-
sion to contain Litvinenko’s volatile
comments and ensure privacy.
Nine Scotland Yard detectives
have flown to Moscow to continue
their investigation, and last Fri-
day, it was announced the Prime
Minister from the early 90s Yegor
Gaidar had fallen ‘mysteriously’ ill
in Dublin.
It demonstrates clearly and pub-
licly that, as long as the Russian
Federation has the power to sell
and buy nuclear warheads, and the
one-time head of its secret service
as president, it can do whatever the
hell it wants. In Chechnya, in Brit-
ain, in Moscow, where the Forbes
Russia editor was assassinated
and more recently the fierce liberal
journalist Politkovskaya on Putin’s
birthday, in the UN Security Coun-
cil and in the White House where
Vladimir suggested Bush’s election
was undemocratic.
Global news peanuts
Fitzgerald, argued that there was
“a real risk of fundamental injus-
tice”; that their basic human rights
will be abused despite the assur-
ances from US authorities.
Massoud Shadjareh of the Islamic
Human Rights Commission said
he found it puzzling why evidence
against the men, if it does exist, has
not been passed on to British au-
thorities, to charge them in Britain.
“Since Britain has some of the
most comprehensive terrorism
laws in the world, if there is any
evidence against these men, they
should be charged and tried in a
British court,” he said. The Brit-
ish government has come under
widespread pressure over the non-
reciprocal nature of its controver-
sial extradition treaty, which, after
more than two years, has yet to be
ratified by the US Congress. This
treaty confirms Britain is losing her
sovereignty to the US, and this ver-
dict confirms we live not in a democ-
racy but under US dictatorship!

t is funny how the last issue
always aims to bring about
hope. Not today, not my page!
In a week that has from what
can be superficially described
as “quite normal,” we have had a
barrage of yet continuing news sto-
ries that show us in just the most
beautiful of details, how every peice
of the world is falling apart.
According to the BBC, there are
over thirty Russian spies in the UK
who all answer to the top two guys,
who in turn report back to Moscow.
How the BBC knows this, I have no
idea, but it does show in a small way
just how the cold war never really
ended. Two responsible powers spy-
ing on each other? Why, whatever
for? In the nasty world of interna-
tional politics, everything is game.
and why should any nation sacrifice
its own power, influence and afflu-
ence for the sake of another’s popu-
lation or government?
Men are far from perfect, and
hope in this frail being is subject to
a siege of trials and hardship. When
we allow men who have commit-
ted no provable crime to have their
rights taken away by ministerial
whim, do we not become those who
take away honour and justice?
Last week, the Iraqi parliament
voted unanimously to extend the
country’s state of emergency, Not
too surprising considering the state
it’s in! President George W. Bush,
who declared himself a “realist,”
disavowed a leaked White House
memo that suggested Prime Min-
ister Nouri al-Maliki was either
dumb, weak, or a liar. Maliki re-
sponded (with much diplomatic te-
nacity) by canceling a dinner date
with the POTUS (President of the
United States of America – what, do
you think that I can be bothered to
write that every time?!)
Marine Corps intelligence in the
Sunni Triangle determined that US
forces were “no longer capable of
militarily defeating the insurgency,”
thus heralding the onset of civil war
in Iraq. Just like in Team America,
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E is always
the last to find out, poor guy.
The US Computer Emergency
Readiness team issued a “situ-
ational awareness report” warning
of an Al Qaeda “cyber threat,” and
Technical Mujahid (a magazine de-
signed to “break the siege placed
upon [Muslims] by the media of
the Crusaders and their followers”)
released its first issue. This hum-
ble sub-editor has tried repeatedly
to get a hold of this book for “Fe-
lix research purposes,” only to be
shouted down - “We already have
the NUS, WHAT DYA NEED THAT
FOR?!
In Mexico, “donnybrooks and yell-
ing matches” preceded the four-
minute swearing-in ceremony of
President Felipe Calderon, and the
Mexican Committee for the Study of
Kimilsungism hosted a seminar on
the deceased North Korean dicta-
tor’s seminal academic tome, “The
Workers’ Party of Korea Is the Party
of the Great Leader Comrade Kim
Il Sung.” Indeed. South Korea’s Ag-
riculture Ministry announced plans
to kill all the cats and dogs in Iksan,
Korea. Minister Kim Chang-sup de-
fended the action, undertaken in re-
sponse to an outbreak of avian flu,
by saying, “Other countries do it.
They just don’t talk about it.” Thank
God it’s not just me then.
A “bizarrely festive” atmosphere
was noted on the streets of Beirut,
where over one million Hezbollah
supporters rallied for the ousting
of Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad
Saniora. Some see it as an irre-
sponsible move to take power in a
region that needs, above all else,
a proactively peaceful governing
body. However, votes and protes-
tors do not lie.
And of course we do not need to
read the leading article any more
times to see that death and poisons
were felling Russians around the
globe... It’s raining, it’s pouring...
