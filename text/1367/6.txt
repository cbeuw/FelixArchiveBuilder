Rationality vs overreaction
T
he recent comments
in this section have in-
spired much debate.
One thing to learn is
that judging a writer’s
true intention based on what he
or she writes is always risky. Take
Samuel Lynas’ article for example.
The more naïve readers among us
may have been fooled into think-
ing it was motivated by a concern
for morality and a desire to correct
misinterpretations. Fortunately, Mr.
Lynas settled the issue himself last
week with his bigoted reply in the
Letters section, declaring that his
article was for the attention of non-
Muslims waking up to the ‘danger
that Islam represents to this coun-
try.’ There can be no doubts about
his intention now.
Ironically, in the same issue, Pier-
luigi Frison wrote of the ‘need to be
peaceful and respect each other.’
Perhaps he was unaware that his
code of ‘general morality’ was be-
ing broken a few pages later by
the very person he was expressing
agreement with. Or worse still, per-
haps morals do not apply when the
most important religious figure of
Islam is labelled ‘mentally ill.’
Now let us consider the ISoc’s
decision to post the original arti-
cle. What the Society overlooked
was that history is always a sensi-
tive issue and people take it per-
sonally. Against that background,
it is divisive to portray a conquest
in a positive light, given that fac-
tual evidence may be inconclusive.
Furthermore, it is an unfortunate
reality that religions themselves
are judged upon the conduct of
their followers. Every sincere Mus-
lim and open-minded non-Muslim
As Felix decides to draw a line under the ongoing debate, Basel Siddiqi provides his

knows Islam to be a peaceful reli-
gion. Yet the likes of Lynas will con-
tinue to misinform others and their
ammunition will be the conduct
and carelessness of Muslims. The
ISoc must be credited, though, for
the events they organise to educate
students about Islam. Such events
are conveniently ignored by those
who are poisoning themselves with
conspiracy theories that Muslims
somehow want to force the West to
‘adopt the dictates’ of Islam.
The response to the article has
proved equally distressing. Since
Lynas has discredited himself by
the admission of his motives, it
is not worth discussing his opin-
ion further. Then there is the is-
sue of educated observers such as
Pierluigi Frison reaching drastic
conclusions as seen in his closing
paragraph last week. If Saad Raja’s
defence of the ISoc article can be
taken as a demonstration that ‘ag-
gressive Muslims are everywhere,’
then Samuel Lynas’ comments in-
dicate that fear-mongering Islamo-
phobes are also ubiquitous. In that
case, one would be equally justified
to say that it is Lynas’ views, not
those of Raja, that constitute a ‘per-
fect microcosm of the frictions’ be-
tween the Muslims and the West.
Saad Raja based his comment on
studies of Ottoman history by histo-
rians whom he mentioned by name.
Pierluigi Frison considers those
sources biased and wades into the
historical debate about what actu-
ally happened, obviously confident
that the sources he himself relies
upon are totally unbiased of course.
He provides a whole list of lands
conquered by the Ottomans and de-
scribes how parts of the population
A
t the risk of re-igniting
the same debate until
we are all blue in the
face I initially hesitated
to write this but the
comments made by Pierluigi Frison
cannot go unchallenged. Firstly, note
to self, an article in the ‘comments’
section of a paper is for the expres-
sion of personal opinion, not an open
forum for propaganda.
Mr Frison’s piece and that of Mr
Lynas were riddled with historical
inaccuracies which would make any
historian turn in their grave. Mr Fri-
son however, does make a pertinent
remark, he urges us “to get informed
by reading any version of the facts
that is neither bias [sic] from the
point of view of the conqueror nor
the conquered”. I agree, but there is
no such thing as unbiased historical
fact. This does not mean however,
that we should all give up, just that
we should keep these limitations in
mind. A fine example of where the
old historical accounts are being
completely overturned, is in the his-
tory of the Vikings. They have tra-
ditionally been taught as rampaging,
bloodthirsty Nordic tribes, spreading
nothing but carnage throughout Eu-
rope and dismantling the civilisation
thattheRomansbuilt. Newevidence
based on recent archeological finds,
and newly discovered manuscripts
and diaries, are proving that the
Vikings were in fact a constructive
force, stimulating trade and cultural
developments throughout Europe.
Similar changes have been occuring
in the history of the Ottomans (see
revisionist historians Nelson, Duby,
Sawyer and Coupland).
So what did Prophet Muhammad
(Peace be upon him), really teach
about war? Before every battle he
used to instruct his commanding
chiefs and remind them of the eth-
ics of war. These included not killing
wounded soldiers and prisoners of
war. Residential areas were not to
be pillaged, plundered or destroyed,
nor should they touch the property
of anyone except those who were
fighting against them. In particular,
religious and sacred buildings of all
faiths, were to be protected. Mus-
lims were forbidden from taking
anything from the general public of
the conquered country without pay-
ing for it. They were even forbidden
fromuprootingtreesandplants.Now
let us compare this with the continu-
ous killings of innocent civilians, and
the destruction of entire cities, all
justified by ‘liberal’ and ‘progressive’
western states as being unavoidable
‘collateral damage’.
Frison’s flamboyant remarks that
Muslims at this fine institute of ex-
cellence do not believe in general
morality or maybe even encourage
terrorism is, well, an opinion. In this
science and evidence based institute
we leave no stone unturned, let this
not be an exception. Let us not allow
our emotions or preformed stere-
otypes cloud our intellect. Judge for
yourself, do the research, visit the
‘immoral’ Islamic society events and
if you’re feeling exceptionally bold
one day have a conversation with
an ‘immoral’ Muslim, you could be
pleasantly surprised.
As for Lynas’ letter to the editor?
No comment.
A response to Pierluigi Frison (1366)
were allegedly ‘enslaved, raped and
murdered.’ That is, if we choose to
believe the ‘unbiased’ sources Fri-
son has managed to unearth, above
those that Raja referred to. One
can see the stalemate and never-
ending argument developing here,
which Frison exacerbates by comi-
cally resorting to the ‘chicken or
egg’ game; stressing that Muslim
armies conquered the Middle East
from Christians before the crusad-
ers attempted the opposite.
Frison would predictably argue
that his aim was to criticise those
who defend conquests of the past.
But the simple claim that armies
are often brutal to civilians post-
conquest would have been enough
to do this, since ‘it should be clear
to EVERYBODY’ anyway. Instead
he uses emotive language, as Lynas
did, in what seems to be an attempt
to gain the moral high ground. This
attempt becomes obvious when he
begins praising European coun-
tries and ‘especially Britain’ for
condemning imperialism and the
‘leeching’ of raw materials and
establishment of puppet regimes.
Perhaps Frison has already forgot-
ten about the illegal invasion of Iraq
but I am sure the irony of his praise
would not be lost on most readers.
Upon finding the ISoc article ob-
jectionable, the sensible approach
would have been to ask rational
questions about its validity. Instead,
the response has been bigoted
(Lynas) and exaggerated (Frison).
This is not befitting of a tolerant
society and we must rise above the
blame game and realise it is not the
duty of just one community to be
‘careful and teach respect.’ That re-
sponsibility lies with everyone.
Basel Siddiqi T
here’s a saying in
television that you
shouldn’t work with
children and animals.
In my opinion an
equally important adage is that,
when in England, you should nev-
er plan any outdoor event more
than 24 hours ahead of time. Do-
ing so guarantees that you will
end up sitting on the beach in a
thunder storm or running a mar-
athon in a heat wave. So, having
arranged Orient House’s Christ-
mas trip to Rochester Dickensian
Festival, I shouldn’t have been
surprised two days before we
were due to go to hear the weath-
er warning for gale force winds
and forecast for heavy rain! The
day dawned and the rain and
winds were in evidence as we all
boarded the bus. I hoped that this
trip wouldn’t be remembered as
the one where several students
developed hypothermia. By some
miracle, however, by the end of
the hour and a bit long coach
journey, we arrived in a cold but
gloriously sunny Rochester.
The city was complete with tra-
ditional fair, Christmas market,
street theatre, a whole array of
Dickens’ characters wandering
through the crowds and even a
brass band playing Christmas
songs whilst snow fell (thanks to
the marvellous fake snow ma-
chine that was in situ). Rochester
is where Charles Dickens spent
a large number of his childhood
years and many of his books are
based in the area. Hence the city
hosts this event every year to cel-
ebrate their claim and the narrow
high street was crammed full of
people enjoying the chaos.
Having enjoyed the fantastic
performers, looked around the
castle, museum and cathedral
that Rochester boasts and spent
our pennies displaying our
throwing skills (or lack of them)
on the coconut shy, we all got
back on the bus, thawed out and
headed to a local hotel for dinner.
Three courses, crackers and
a bit of shaking our funky stuff
later, it was time to head back to
London.
