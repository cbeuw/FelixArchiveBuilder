“With a trail of radiation leading
all the way to Moscow, was it Pu-
tin who ordered the unfortunate’s
death? But, as many commenta-
tors convincingly point out, is Putin
foolish enough to have someone
murdered so publicly? Or perhaps
it was, as the official line goes, a
small part in a larger picture trying
to discredit Russia?”

“Forget about bath oils, perfume,
and clothes. I’d rather not battle
with sales shoppers to exchange
unwanted items. Whilst my sis-
ter settled with buying five identi-
cal black T-shirts for my dad last
Christmas, I desperately scoured
the shops for something that would
trump her in the desirable stakes.”

“Wonderful dress on Lily Allen or
anyone below about the age of 25.
Seriously, how old is this women?
You'd have to carbon date her to
find out! You can't tell from her bo-
toxed face, which is probably 90%
plastic and animal derivatives, 10%
human. This fact is only highlighted
by her lolita-style dress.”

“Anyway, the point of this article is
to act as a guide to the festive sea-
son around this lovely town other-
wise known as London. First of all,
let’s start with Christmas parties,
since that comes first chronologi-

party was great, which can only
mean one thing: This year will be
even better.”

ULU leagues secure
At ULU Council on Monday night,
John Collins, Union President, sin-
gle-handedly spoke for a motion to
allow Imperial’s sports teams to
continue competing in the Univer-
sity of London Cups despite fierce
opposition from the Kings College
and UCL delegations. ICU had a
previous agreement with ULU to
allow teams to continue competing
in the league competitions, but this
did not cover the knockout cups.
The motion was passed by a wafer-
thin majority of just one vote.
Kings argued that ULU leagues
are open to non-affiliated institu-
tions, such as the University of the
Arts (UoA), whereas cups are not
and that once Imperial left UL they
would no longer to be eligible to
compete. In our favour, Mr Collins
argued that ICU has been a mem-
ber of ULU for over 40 years and it
was inappropriate to compare us
to UoA; he added that it would set
a bad precedent that could lead to
the destruction of the competitions
concerned if more colleges chose
to leave UL. He also pointed out the
financial benefits for ULU of allow-
ing ICU sports teams to compete,
as the Union will be paying an entry
fee. Senior Union figures believe
that it is worth paying for the privi-
lege of allowing sports teams to
continue to compete in leagues and
cups as ULU. ULU leagues have
proved extremely popular and have
generally been well run by ULU
management. ICU has no plans to
continue to purchase any more of
the services that ULU would offer.
The motion would have fallen if
it wasn’t for the late appearance
of Deputy President (Education &
Welfare)Ben“Fluffy”Harris,whose
vote secured the majority. Mr Col-
lin’s motion was also staunchly sup-
ported by the large LSE delegation
and without their support the mo-
tion would not have passed. Some
ULU sabbaticals who were initially
opposed to allowing us to continue
entering the cups were eventu-
ally won round by Mr Collins’ argu-
ments and voted for the motion. No
doubt they found the financial argu-
ment from ICU particularly appeal-
ing given the parlous state of ULU
finances.
This motion should have been far
less arduous if our whole delegation
had turned up. The Union’s ULU
delegates,LinMeiandFurquanKid-
wai, have received a formal warn-
ing from the President for failing to
give notice of their non-attendance,
which almost resulted in Imperial
teams being denied the opportunity
to compete in cups. This would no
doubt have been met with anger by
sports clubs who enjoy competing
in the knockout tournaments.
A cup, not of the ULU variety, but a cup nonetheless. Oh yes, it’s definitely a cup of some kind. Hmm
ICU teams keep the right to compete in ULU’s sports leagues
Aston rejects NUS
in new referendum
The NUS lost a member institution
last night, as Aston University Stu-
dents’ Guild announced the results
of its referendum on disaffiliation.
550 (53%) voted to disaffiliate, with
a turnout of just over 1,032 (about
15%). Aston is consistently rated in
the top 20 universities for teaching,
but is outside the top research-fo-
cused institutions. It is a small uni-
versity, with around 7,000 students.
The Executive Committee (EC) of
Aston Guild believed that they were
not getting value for money from
the NUS and that their students’
best interests would be served by
choosing to disaffiliate. EC mem-
ber Jarrad Glover told Felix: “We
believed that the NUS just didn’t
represent value for money for As-
ton Guild. The NUS has achieved
little of late, and we didn’t think that
what they were giving us was worth
the tens of thousands of pounds we
paid them annually.”
In addition to the substantial af-
filiation fee, the overwhelming
strength of feeling against the poli-
tics of the NUS was also a key fac-
tor for students who voted to leave.
It was also evident that the intro-
duction of the NUS Extra discount
card at Aston stirred up a lot of an-
tipathy towards the NUS as several
students objected to paying £10 for
a card that was previously free, on
the grounds that it amounted to the
marketisation of student discounts
by one organisation.
The referendum at Aston did not
pass without incident. A petition
was submitted to Aston Guild be-
fore the results were announced
questioning whether the NUS tac-
tic of sending dozens of their cam-
paigners on campus each day made
the referendum result invalid.
Union elections have rules re-
garding media access and spending
to ensure that no candidate has an
unfair advantage. Mr Glover com-
mented: “There were only two As-
ton students who were prepared to
commit time to campaign to stay in
the NUS. We told the NUS to stay
away as it should have been a mat-
ter for Aston students to decide, but
they came anyway. It is undemo-
cratic that they are allowed to over-
whelm campuses during referenda
in this way. The margin of our vic-
tory should have been greater.”
NUS campaigners present in-
cluded Wes Streeting, VP Educa-
tion and leader of the Labour Stu-
dents faction. It has been reported
to Felix that he cancelled an entire
day of meetings to assist campaign-
ers at Aston. This news was met
with incredulity by the leader of the
No campaign at Imperial and City
& Guilds College Union President,
James Fok: “We respect that the
students of Imperial voted narrowly
to join the NUS but we are commit-
ted to ensure that the NUS delivers
for us. ICU are paying them £52,000
a year and they shouldn’t be using
it to pay for the salaries of staff to
stand and hand out leaflets. Mr
Streeting will only benefit Imperial
students if he is representing us
at the highest level, like he prom-
ised us during our referendum, not
wasting his time and our money at
Aston.”
