Defective fire safety equipment puts students at risk
A fire in student accommodation
near South Kensington campus led
to ten students being taken to hos-
pital with smoke inhalation injuries
and gutting part of the inside of the
building.
The Fire Brigade were called
to Chamberlain House, Cromwell
Road on Monday afternoon after
residents in the block discovered
the fire. The residents, reportedly
mostly students from the College,
were led to safety by fire crews
and ten were taken to hospital. One
student had to be rescued from the
third floor of the building by ladder
after the smoke became too thick
for them to exit via the ground
floor.
The likely cause of the fire, ac-
cording to the Fire Brigade, was
a tumble dryer in the basement of
the building. The smoke from the
initial blaze filled the upper floors
of the building, causing the inhala-
tion injuries. The basement of the
building has been severely dam-
aged, and the thick smoke has dam-
aged the rest of the block to varying
degrees.
Fire crews investigating the
scene discovered that the fire alert
system had been tampered with,
possibly maliciously, as all the
break-glass from the alert boxes
was missing. It is not clear who is
responsible for this. The building
had numerous other problems with
regards to fire safety, including fire
doors being wedged open, defective
emergency escape lighting, a lack
of fire action notices, and defec-
tive fire-fighting equipment. The
landings of the building were also
blocked by stored furniture, mak-
ing escape difficult. The block itself
is classified as a “House in Multi-
ple Occupation” (HIMO), making
many of these provisions required
by property law, including escape
routes and fire-fighting equipment.
Ben Harris, Deputy President (Ed-
ucation & Welfare), is understood to
be in contact with the landlords of
the property.
The property is not on College’s
list of private sector accommoda-
tion. However, the block is popular
with IC students due to its prox-
imity to the campus; the building
has 12 separate flats, with 5 or 6
students in each flat. The Fire Bri-
gade has indicated that should the
incident have occurred at night,
the situation could have been much
more serious.
Readers are reminded that
checking the fire safety equipment
in rented property is of vital im-
portance - for example, check that
extinguishers have regular main-
tenance markings, and that any
smoke alarms are tested regularly.
Any faults should be immediately
reported to the landlord or letting
agent. The College’s Private Hous-
ing Office can provide advice to
students who have concerns about
the state of their property, and can
be contacted at private.housing@
imperial.ac.uk, or at www.imperial.
ac.uk/residences/privatehousing.
