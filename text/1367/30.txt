90s style
Fashion is cyclical, and
we've already done the
60s, 70s and 80s to death.
The 90s time is now. I
can see the sceptical look
upon your face, but you'll
come around. After all
fashion is linked to music,
and with all the 90s group
comebacks, fashion is not
far behind.
Unicorns and magical
things
Especially in the form of
jewellery. As seen at Top-
shop, with silver chain
necklaces and earrings
with plastic & mirrored
charms of unicorns, stars
and other magical para-
phernalia attached. Also
see, Pan's Labyrinth, a
film out now, split between
two tales; one fantastical,
the other a civil war.
Lela Rose
Her New York Collection
is super-cute, with ruffled
necklines, and pastel col-
ours paired with black and
olive tones.
Sarah Harding for Ultimo
So trashy. I have to say, I
hate Girls Aloud. Even if
their songs are vaguely
catchy, I can't stand their
chavy hair and style.
Harding even has a copy
of chav queen, Victoria
Beckham's hairstyle. Do
Ultimo really want this
image? Then again, chavs
buy underwear too.
Shaken, certainly not stirred
Folake Adegbohun checks out the Afro-Caribbean Society's spectacular fashion show
30 felix Friday 8 December 2006
FASHION fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk
ture decides to use a theme from
a western film to showcase it’s fin-
est of all finery. However do not be
fooled by the contradicting theme.
The action film theme gave a mix-
ture of electric sexiness and explo-
siveness to the show.
The show began with Grace Jones
(Wendy) wearing a red jumpsuit and
bullet belt from Twinkled. LSE’s
very own ACS President Nnamdi
The Afrogala, hosted by the Afro-
Caribbean Society on the 25th of
November 2006, was one of ICU’s
biggest events. The main highlight
of the show was the Fashion Show
which was in theme with the recent
Bond movie “Casino Royale”.
This was, unlike most fashion
shows, certainly unique. How ironic
that a show based on demonstrat-
ing the African and Caribbean cul-
Awa–Kalu, was a bad guy, wearing
a waistcoat and trousers, both in
black, accompanied by 3 bad girls
Erica, Amaka Akobundu and Odiri
Obrutse. All were wearing identical
outfits; silk Chinese gowns and vin-
tage blue brassiere from Twinkled.
The show had a general theme for
the guys, which was quite boring. It
consisted of standard pin-striped
waistcoats and plain trousers but
the accessories, such as the bowler
hat worn by Remi and the blue lion
tie, from Twinkled, were thrilling.
Fortunately the same cannot be
said for the female models. The
outfits were extraordinarily elec-
trifying with KCL
’s epitome of sexy,
Charissa Hu, spotting a jaw drop-
ping Dolce and Gabbana bra with
silk shorts and an Aquascutum
trench coat. IC’s Vese Aghoghovbia
and Louisa Awolaja were both wear-
ing a brownish red leather jackets,
berets and white dresses with neck
ties, both outfits from Twinkled.
The Bond girl played by Ojuigo
Ndukwe bewitched us with an el-
egantly worn Sue Wong, hand bead-
ed, beige silk dress. Shaun Githuku
emulated Bond to perfection as he
graced the stage in a white tux jack-
et, worn with black trousers and a
black shirt with a black bow tie. It
most certainly gave him a licence
to thrill.
The show was undoubtedly a suc-
cess, with something for everyone,
from retro to sheer class. Even if
the scripted scenes did momentar-
ily detract the limelight from the
outfits, one hardly noticed as the
overall effect was dazzling. With all
the pizzazz oozing from the models,
the funky outfits and the melodra-
matic acting onlookers can only
wish that they too could look so ef-
fortlessly chic, who says Halloween
can’t be everyday.
A big thank you to Amena Im-
asekha and Ngozi Ofili-Okonkwo
the organisers of the show. Most of
the clothes worn and all the props
were kindly provided by Twinkled
(www.twinkled.net), a vintage shop
in Kingly court on Carnaby Street.
Felix fashion police: what not to wear
Will.I.Am looks like he's channel-
ling Willy Wonka here. Actually, he
just looks like he wants to be him.
He's probably having a house made
of candy being built as we speak.
Justin Timberlake, however, looks
good enough to eat in grey, red and
black.
OK, her face looks a bit like a foetus.
I hear prolific "partying" (or snort-
ing a small country's GDP worth
of drugs) does that to you. But the
monochrome look is hot. Just re-
member to put some pants on when
clambering out of a limousine in
front of the leering paparazzi.
Wonderful dress on Lily Allen or
anyone below 25. Seriously, how old
is this women? You'd have to car-
bon date her! You can't tell from her
botoxed face, which is probably 90%
plastic and animal derivatives, 10%
human. This fact is only highlighted
by her lolita-style dress.
Gwen Stefani looks super kawai! I'll
be disappointed if Japanese people
don't actually say "super kawai". I
used to think French people say
"hyper-cool", a phrase used in my
70s era french text book. Apparent-
ly it's the french equivalent of "fab".
Whatever. Gwen looks hyper-cool.
