Helping people help themselves
Parents are impossible to buy for.
Well mine are anyway. Brothers and
sisters are happy with any trinket
that adds to the clutter building up
in their bedrooms, while my gran’s
sorted with a Queen at 80 DVD.
But parents are something else
altogether. The only things that im-
press them are out of my overdraft
limit. Getting them something they
need is a gesture not completely
lost on them, the £60 global knife
rack I splashed out on a few years
back has had pride of place in the
kitchen until the wall it was careful-
ly attached to was brutally ripped
out by builders a few weeks ago.
Forget about bath oils (must be
organic), perfume (not too over-
powering), and clothes. I’d rather
not battle with sales shoppers to ex-
change unwanted items. Whilst my
sister settled with buying five iden-
tical black T-shirts for my dad last
Christmas, I desperately scoured
the shops for something that would
trump her in the desirable stakes.
Losing hope, I decided to settle on
some CDs plus hand cream until I
stumbled across an advert for World
Vision’s Alternative Gift Catalogue.
I was spoilt for choice immedi-
ately, with something for everyone
in every price bracket. Whilst I was
immediately drawn by an adorable
goat, I eventually settled on a toilet
for a school, a bargain at £30 for
my dad. I thought back to my gap
year, where going to the loo meant
squatting over a hole and keeping
balance whilst maggots wriggled
onto your flip flops. Encountering a
loo with a seat was cause for seri-
ous excitement.
My mum would flinch at anything
involving bodily functions so she
got blankets for an entire family
because the accompanying picture
was adorable. Each present comes
with a gift card, and this year Oxfam
Unwrapped are introducing fridge
magnets so parents can proudly
show the neighbours they’ve raised
veritable philanthropists.
The number of catalogues has
expanded this year, offering gifts
ranging from oxen, AIDS education
programmes, and mango planta-
tions, although World Vision and
Oxfam are two of the most estab-
lished. Oxfam even offers gift track-
ing so you can follow exactly where
your goat ends up. Inspired, my
dad has since bought the boss-who-
has-everything a yak for a family
in Mongolia. Secret Santa for my
formidable boss was sorted with a
£5 mosquito net. Now I just have
my Oxfam Unwrapped wedding list
to look forward to. Let’s just hope
any future husband doesn’t mind
having to pay for our Dualit toaster.
Happy giving!

Forget socks or toiletries this year. What your parents really want for Christmas is a goat for someone else
Engineers Without Borders (EWB-
UK), which aims to facilitate human
development through engineering,
is one of the fastest growing stu-
dent-run charities at Imperial. On
Monday, 27th November it held yet
another fascinating talk on the con-
cept of “Slum Networking” under a
global issue of “habitat”.
The guest speaker, Priti Parikh,
is a chartered civil engineer who
is currently undertaking a Ph.D. in
Sustainable Development at Cam-
bridge University.
“Slum Networking” is a concept
devised by Himanshu Parikh (Pri-
ti’s father), which approaches the
problem of slums by looking at them
in the context of the city as opposed
to an isolated unit.
Slums in India usually consist of
a system of poorly built shelters,
some made of brick, others out of
corrugated steel and tarpaulin.
Within these areas, sewage and wa-
ter supply can often be found in the
same location, exposing the slum
communities to diseases.
Women and girls are required to
spend a large proportion of their day
disposing of household and sanitary
waste and collecting clean water in-
stead of preparing the children for
school or attending lessons.
A possible solution to these issues
was devised in the form of slum net-
working which looks to improve life
in slums without direct interven-
tion from NGOs, governments, and
other organisations. To use a cliché,
it is a method of helping slum dwell-
ers help themselves.
The first method of implementing
slum networking is by manoeuvring
the natural drainage paths of the
city to run alongside the slums. This
goes a long way towards improving
the slum environment whilst dra-
matically reducing costs compared
to conventional “slum solutions”,
such as public stand posts for fresh
water distribution and community
latrines.
To complement and increase the
efficiency of the natural drainage
system, topography management
can also be applied to the city. This
Development through slum networking
involves the engineering of roads
to slope continuously downwards
so that they reach their natural wa-
ter level with minimal intervention.
These roads can also be contoured
to act as channels for storm drain-
age. These slum networking tech-
niques substantially reduce the
costs of alternative drainage meth-
ods and also lower maintenance
costs.
One of the many positive impacts
of slum networking is that where
slum dwellers have the means,
there have been huge spurts of
investment to improve their slum
housing. Research has shown that
the three main stimuli for invest-
ment, in descending order, are
physical services, social status, and
tenure security.
Employing this psychology, gov-
ernments can tap into the latent
potential of the slum-dwellers
to help them increase their own
resources.
In addition to this, the standard
of living has improved, a fact un-
derlined by health-related statistics
such as a decrease in the infant
mortality rate, a reduced number
of working days lost due to illness,
and a large reduction in medical
expenditure.
The next hurdle that develop-
ment workers such as Priti and her
father face is gaining the backing
from governments to implement
the methods of slum networking in
poor, densely populated areas.
