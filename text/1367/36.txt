With the team still being finalised
at 2am on Sunday, it was a Christ-
mas miracle that we managed to
get 9 players out 10 hours later for
our second match of the season
against GKT 4th. With a few people
a little the worse for wear (Clarkey)
we found our way to Oval in time
for Sammy to take everyone on a
bird squawking warm-up (running
around like birds, obviously) to try
and intimidate the opposition, who
outnumbered us, 13 (including the
shockingly biased umpires) to 9.
The game started with RSM hav-
ing the clear upper hand as far as
skill went, with the forwards mak-
ing some good runs to goal. The
shite umpiring standard became
clear as GKT struck a ball clearly
outside the D and were awarded
a goal which was later retracted
as the umpires were swarmed by
RSM complaints, including my
personal favourite from Alice R:
“Excuse me ref, not to be rude, but
Sammy is a pretty good goalkeeper
and she wouldn’t have left it if it was
inside the D.” Hell yeah! You had to
be there.
The game continued, with some
excellent runs from everyone; spe-
cial mentions to Dasha and Lucy
who were later awarded joint man
of the match for their skilful runs,
taking out 3 or 4 players from the
opposition each time; legends. We
managed to get some more short
corners and although we did use
the infallible “426” game plan,
the most we achieved was almost
breaking a defender’s ankle. Was
that the same girl Ka’ie hit in the
back of the knees with her stick in
a way that would have made a Ben
Gates tackle look almost legal?
Hmm, maybe.
Despiteourefforts,GKTmanaged
to score in the second half after the
referees decided that because GKT
couldn’t stop Welshy’s 16s they were
going to call her up for “dangerous
play”. Another fine example of the
talented refs, who also allowed GKT
shorts to be injected with a hit, de-
spite Spammy charging out of the
goal and informing the girl that this
was illegal about an inch away from
her face. She looked like she was on
the verge of tears.
After the RSM were told to “calm
down” by the opposition on many oc-
casions, it was only a matter of time
before the game drew to a close,
leaving us with our first defeat of
the season, which is annoying be-
cause we would have destroyed
them if we had had a full team! Oh
well, shit happens; at least we got
a free lunch at the pub out of it,
courtesy of GKT. A huge thank you
to everyone who showed up for the
match, both the usual players and
those who help when they can. It is
greatly appreciated. Oh, TFC was
awarded to their umpires.
Sorry if you were expecting an-
other hidden bum in the photo – our
team mascot was unavailable.

ing, pies and maybe even a little
