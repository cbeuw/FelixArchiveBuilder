SOUASH R A C K E T S C L U B
N E W S Q U A S H COACHING A SUCCESS
This vear has been one of mixed fortunes
for the Sauash Club. The standard has been
considerably improved, but we have lost our
own courts. The Club has a wide fixture fist
including some of the privincial Universities
(Bristol. Leicester) and some of the Oxbrtage
Colleges. Our best matches are against the
latter and the London Hospitals. The First
team degistered 14 wins and 12 defeats,
while the second team were virtually unbeat-
en. At its best the team was extremelv strong,
but it was not often possible or necessary to
field % fifll side. Some matches were played
at the West London Squash Courts, where
the College has a block booking all through
the week — here there is a delightful bar and
many a good evening was passed by a spir-
ited team.
Mr. NzruUah Khan of the Junior Carlton
was engaged to provide free coaching to
members of the dub meeting with enthusiasm
and considerable success; it is hoped to con-
tinue this scheme next year.
In the London University League the Col-
lege was placed second to L.S.E.; there is
room for improvement During the next year
we will be using the West London courts
again, but it is hoped that distance will not
deter the flourishing membership.
SOCCER R E P O R T
Last term the Soccer Club concluded a
most successful season, in which the 1st X I
won the U . L . Knock-Out Cup, the U . L .
League Premier Division Championship and
were runners up in the U.L. Six-a-Side Com-
petition. The 2nd X I were runners up in the
U.L.League, Division I OR), the 3rd in Div.
II (R), and the 5th X I winners of Div. I l l (R).
There has been an excellent spirit through-
out the 8 XI's run by the club, and this
should remain, if not be strengthened, under
next season's officials:
Captain — Dave Hunt
Vice-Captain — Eddie Olding
Secretary — Bill Riddell
Jun. Treasurer — Brian Junbridge
Fixtures Sec. — Cliff Matfhiews
Social Sec. —
Next season 7 teams have been entered
in the U . L . League as against 6 this season,
and I hope that next season will be as suc-
cessful! as this, both on and off the field.
I must thank Willie Gough and Bill Rid-
dell for their hard work and efficiency which
has gone a long way to making this season
so successfuD.
D E N . HARBURN
On Thursday, 5th April, the Cross-County
Club left for a short tour of the Emerald
Isle. We made the crossing by the night ferry
— being "entertained" all the way by the
Irish in their own inimitable manner. After
a morning spent sightseeing around Dublin
and procuring lodgings on the North Bank
we were entertained bv Guinness who claimed
that the purpose of their hospitality was to
make sure that all visiting teams to Dublin
should not disgrace their Irish lads. Having
shown us briefly how the liouor is made,
we were igiven a reallv excellent five-course
meal and.introduced to their Foreign Stout
(swingirtg* which unfortunately is not obtain-
able in the British Isles.
The next day the first match of the tour
was a medleiv roadfelay around Phoenix
Park. Dublin. Entrants included Dunore and
Clonliffe Harriers (who are the strongest
clubs in Eire, the latter having the internat-
ional Neville running), Avondale, and the
Civil Service. Out of 10 teams the I.C. team
came third to Clonliffe and Dunore.
The next day a meeting had been arranged
at the Santry stadium — the fastest track in
Europe — but unfortunatelv it w*s nrtder 3
inches of water and consequently the whole
meeting had to be reduced to hist »' 2 mft»
road race in which T.C. put in another com-
mendable effort coming third again to Clon-
liffe and Dunore.
The team then left Dublin for the Hills
which provided them with some excellent fac-
ilities, and training before leaving.
