C A R N I V A L PROCESSION C O L L E C T S
£105
The Carnival procession, winding its way
through the astonished, bemused and gener-
ous inhabitants of Kensington, Fulham and
Chelsea, looked a cross between a Mardi
Gras shenadigans and a Pyjama Party. A l -
though it was competing for attention against
the Cup Final, it collected over £105. 0

The Carnival Week received a warm send
off at the May Ball, but by Monday the tem-
po was positively vibrating; a fast, colourful,
and exciting evening was put on by the over-
seas societies. The pace was set by H.E., the
Ambassador of Tunisia (fulfilling his firtjt
public appearance in England) briefly and fit-
tingly. After a succession of guitarists, vio-
linists, and comedians, the show reached a
magnificent climax with the West Indies Steel
Band. Mention at this stage should be made
of Dan the Bomb who provided continuity
with jokes not in his usual repertoire.
Meanwhile, back in the dining room, a
constitution shattering assortment of national
food was laid on — most popular? Chinese
tea. Unfortunately, one could not participate
wholeheartedly without serious risk of indi-
gestion. At the bar, a delightful Geisha did
a brisk trade in Sake, but beer still seemed to
sell best.
After the interval some fine dancing by
oriental beauties in national costume was fol-
lowed by the popular Night Riders, a good
noise group of U.S. Navy origins.
A n encouraging feature of the evening,
which also included films and dancing, was
the large number of visitors who doubtless
left with a good Impression of I.C.U. profit
of over £70 was made for charity.

Unfortunately the Barbecue was washed
out. There was some dismal dancing under
the Marquis and most pepole adjourned to the
Week's Hall Bar, where from all accounts,
queer happenings were witnessed.

The previous evening, at 4 p.m. G.M.T.
a world record was atempted and broken at
I.C. Mr. Heape swallowed two dozens eggs
in the incredible time of 2 minutes and 11
sees. He had trained for the previous week
on a dozen eggs (large) at lunch-time. The
news was reported by the B.B.C. and made
the front page of the Guardian and the Ex-
press.
The Fete was poorly attended due to the
weather being inclement The Union at last
got its chance to pelt the executive, which
nearly got out of hand when at one stage,
carried away by enthusiasm and successful
rnarkmanship, die throwers didn't pay any-
thing but just grabbed the rotten fruit and
vegetables and let go.
The exhibition of Judo was the highlight of
the afternoon. After watching a lot of girls
were heard expressing their desire to learn,
judo, much to the obvious annoyance and
apprehension of their boy-friends.
