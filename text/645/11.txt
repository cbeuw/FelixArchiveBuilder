Last weekend the boat club
senior squad competed in the
Nottingham Regatta held at the
National Water Sports Centre,
Holme Pierrepoint, on a six lane,
1,500m course.
On the Saturday morning,
following a night at the Munster's
Hotel, the squad arrived at the
course to find a 20mph head
wind causing the water to be
quite rough especially near the
start. The coxless four entered
the elite event against tough
opposition. In their semi-final
they came second qualifying for
the final, beating amongst others
Durham Univ holders of the
Visitor's Challenge Cup at
Henley. In the final the four
performed well to come third,

The senior A coxed four won
their heat with case and in the
final won by fifteen seconds, a
substantial margin.
In the final of Senior A Eights,
the College fight, comprising of
half of the elite eight plus the
eoxless four, was hard pushed in
winning. Off the start IC were
second V 4 length behind Mole-
sey. The 'burn' at 600m gained a
'/. length advantage for IC but
over the last 500m Molesey
pushed back to nearly level. IC
hung on to win by about six feet.
The final race of the day was
the elite eights final. The College
eight got off to a reasonable start
lying in third place at 500m. By
1,000m IC had dropped back to
fourth but managed to row
through Thames Tradesmen in
the last 500m to come third
behind U L and Nottingham
County RA.
On the Sunday the coxless
four again qualified for the final
winning their heat, but in the
final, rowed in very difficult
conditions, again came third.
Half of the elite eight entered
the elite coxed four event and
rowed a superb race in the final
to win by l ' / 4 lengths from
ULBC.
The elite eight again came
third in the final losing the
advantage of a fast start, but
finishing closer to UL than on
Saturday.
Meanwhile, the remainder of
the Boat Club entered Putney
Town regatta on Saturday and
won three of the four events
entered. The Senior B eight won
in the final by two lengths from
Latymer School. The Women's
Senior C four won with ease and
the men's novice four won, again
with ease (at last!). The women's
novice four managed to lose in
the final again but should
manage to win before the end of
the season.
opened the bowling but after the
shine was removed from the ball
the Churchill batsmen began to
get on top (the final four
batsmen were Cambridge blues).
The wicket began to get easier
and the fast outfield did not help
IC. Despite excellent, committed
fielding and light bowling,
Churchill managed 200 by
lunch. After lunch saw an
acceleration in the scoring rate
accompanied by one or two IC
lapses in the field. Churchill
eventually declared of 351 for
five, leaving IC three hours plus
twenty overs to get the target of
352.
Helsby and Eastland began
positively against the Churchill
opening bowlers (one of whom
eas also a 'blue') and maintained
the required run rate for the
opening hour. Unfortunately,
Helsby (27) closed a wide
delivery and was caught behind.
The scoring rate dropped for a
while until Kennedy got his eye
in. he then produced some crisp
strokes including a six over extra
cover. With Eastland still there
IC were always in with a chance.
Good support came from Kelly
(32), Cole (28), Errington (35)
and Bussey (57).
With the last twenty overs to
go IC required 110 with five
wickets left. Eastland reached
his century in the second of the
20 overs with a six over long leg
off the 'blue' bowler. A couple of
quick wickets by Churchill
meant that with ten overs to go
IC required 60 with 3 wickets
left. Some cavalier batting by
Tear, and show, including many
shots that would have had C J B
Wood turning in his grave. Into
the final over and IC required 10
to win with one wicket left.
Fortunately the old hand Bussey
was still in and his experience
carried IC through to a momen-
tus victory with one ball to
spare.
Scores: Churchill 351-5 Dec
IC 352-9.
IC arrived at Cambridge in a
fighting mood, ready for the
11:30am start. The weather was
bright and sunny with a light
south easterly wind. The wicket
was of the shirt front variety
with only a little moisture to
help the bowlers early on. A very
fast outfield had been produced
using one of these new-fangled
lawnmower devices.
IC were desperately unlucky
to lose the toss, and Churchill
opted to bat. Shaw and Tear
