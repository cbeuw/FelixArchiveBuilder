Time to Call Quorum
At last Thursday's U G M ,
various political groups threat-
ened to call quorum and thus
end the meeting, unless their
motion was discussed. Pre-
dictably, such threats were met
with counter-threats, until
finally someone, disillusioned
with the whole thing, called
quorum out of disgust.
Inquoracy and procedural
wrangling have become so rife at
UGMs this year that the only
cause for surprise is that such
blackmailing tactics haven't
been used sooner. No one can
condone the anti-apartheid
movement's actions in holding
the UGM to ransom, but we can
and should question the U G M
standing orders which make it
possible for them to do so.
The trouble is that the various
Union hacks who run UGMs
and deplore what they regard as
apathy in the student body have
EDITORIAL
lost sight of the reasons for the
standing orders. They have
forgotten that the rules exists to
ensure democracy is upheld, and
consequently UGMs have de-
generated into at fantastic and
complicated game whose bizarre
rules are comprehensible only to
a few cognoscenti. These people
are the ones who take part in
(and appear to enjoy) the
procedure at a U G M while
everyone else might as well be
spectators at a game of ten-
dimensional chess. A lot of
people go to a U G M , once,
hoping to have a say in the
running of their Union Can they
be blamed for never going a
second time?
To be more specific, the
quorum rule at a meeting exists
in theory to ensure business is
not conducted unless sufficient
members are present. In prac-
tice, because the quorum needs
to be challenged before the
meeting is dissolved, and be-
cause IC UGMs are frequently
inquorate, the rule merely acts as
a means of giving any individual
the right to close the meeting at
any time. Such a privilege is
clearly open to abuse, as last
Thursday demonstrated.
But does this really need to
be spelt out in such detail?
Surely it's all obvious to anyone
who has ever attended a UGM
(except for the hacks who
perpetuate the system). Either
quorum needs to be drastically
reduced, or (better) the standing
orders changed to prevent such
ludicrous and tedious proce-
duralism. Then, perhaps, we
might start getting a decent turn-
out at our UGMs.

ANOTHER PRESS release, this
time from 'B2' whatever that
may be, and a prize-winning
entry for Pseuds Corner. It
concerns one Dave Stephens,
described in the release as an
'international performance
artist'.
'Trying not to be condescend-
ing but ever biting he rips into
the raw material of existence and
turns it into a world that despite
remaining recognisable also has
the hilarious absurdity of a
dream land that mixes Salvador
Dali with cocoa.'
IN VIEW O F Jon Barnett's
article on the College telephone
service (pages 6 and )7) this
week, it seems appropriate to
include three telephone stories in
this column.
The first concerns our great
and glorious editor who, in his
usual Thursday panic, was
frantically trying to contact the
author of a certain letter he had
received. After impatiently
dialling the number at the top of
the letter several times, he
eventually realised that the
reason he kept getting the
'number unobtainable' tone was
that he had been dialling the
date.
The second relates to Presi-
dent Goulder who became
increasingly annoyed and puzz-
led at the way the number he was
trying to dial was always
engaged, Until it was pointed out
FELIX wmsmmmmmmm
^rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrC'Z'ZO'.

that he was dialling the number
of the phone he was calling
from.
But the third, slightly more
worrying tale is about the
FELIX News Editor, Adrian
James, who told Martin that he
had interchanged the two
telephones on his desk 'because
they work much better that way
round'. Has the strain of the job
become too much, we ask?
SO MANY people wandering in
and out of the FELIX Office
have asked me whether the
advertisement on page 4 is a joke
that I feel bound to tell you that
it is not. Most IC students, I
suppose, if desperate for a
woman to accompany them to
spend the summer on a coral
atoll in the Indian Ocean, would
write to the lonely hearts column
in Time Out or some similar
publication, or even put a small
ad in FELIX.
Such insignificant tactics
clearly have no appeal for Mr
Andrew Grimshaw, IC Honor-
ary Secretary; he takes out an
entire quarter page ad in the
Union newspaper to make sure
of getting his girl—now there's
enterprise for you!
AND FINALLY, since I comm-
ented on a misprint in IC Choir's
programme just before Christ-
mas, it seems only fair to return
the compliment to the orchestra.
Their programme notes for
Wednesday's concert included
the following sentence describ-
ing the bassoon concerto by.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
(1756-91): 'It is an early work,
written in June 1744 '
