The Shape of Things
to Come
An end to masturbatory journalism, no more limp wristed
editorials, more back stabbing, sex, scandal and innuendo—ail
issues on which I was elected. But there's more to editing a
newspaper than just being a nice guy.
My ideas for FELIX next year
are by no means finalised, so my
reason for outlining my plans
now rather than the end of term
is to allow people the opportunity
to offer suggestions and com-
ment before the mould is finally
set.
Many second and third years I
have spoken to have felt that
FELIX has not been as exciting
as it has been in previous years. I
think half the battle in making
a publication exciting is to make
it look more exciting. I would
like to be more adventurous
than my predecessors in terms of
layout and make better use of
photographs and illustrations. A
publication with good photo-
graphs and plenty of illustrations
is far better to read than one that
appears as 'an unappetising sea
of grey text'. If there are any
photographers and cartoonists
who would like to turn their
talents to FELIX next year I
would be delighted to see them.
"any
filth?"
The 'Below the Belt' column
has had some very good mom-
ents this year, but the problem
with having to fill up a weekly
trivia column is that the material
can often be very weak. I would
prefer a monthly gossip column
with some really juicy stories in.
This idea can only take off with
your help. Union and College
personalities like everyone else
have their own skeletons in their
cupboards, the odd rash incident
they would prefer 4,500 people
not to know about. If you have
any filth'on anyone well known,
then do drop me a line. (Rem-
ember even mediocre stories can
be exaggerated and embroidered
a little.)
Feature articles and reviews
are especially enjoyable for the
FELIX staff to do, but they can
only be described as self-
indulgent if not enjoyed by the
people who read them. Many
people have told me they find
them over long and boring. I
personally think this a little,
harsh but unless I get a favour-
able reaction to the contrary
then the reviews and features
will have to be reduced next
year. What do you think?
FELIX has set itself aside
perhaps even aloof from its
readers in jecent years. FELIX
is after all the newspaper of
Imperial College Union and
should not only report Union
activity'but promote it. Imperial
College has a marvellous range
of clubs and societies, some of
which many people are unaware
of. In an attempt to bring club
activity to a wider audience I
would like to feature a club or
society each week. I would like
to discuss this with club captains
and society chairmen before the
end of term so get thinking.
"no strings
attached"
The puzzles section in FELIX
has been a very popular part of
F E L I X for several years, a
tradition I would like to see
continue. Pinocchio, unfor-
tunately has moved on to other
things (with no strings attached?)
so the position of puzzles editor
is vacant. Anyone interested?
Finally, if any of you have any
stunningly marvellous ideas for
FELIX next year that you feel I
should know about then do get
in touch via the FELIX Office.
