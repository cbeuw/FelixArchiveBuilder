Staggering
Conclusion
Dear Sir
I found Mr Kelsey'^ article on
unilateralism somewhat con-
fined. In paragraph six he
recommends a process of 'stag-
gered multilateral disarmament'
as being effective. Then why in
paragraph seven does he say that
we should immediately abandon
all nuclear weapons? This is not
a particularly 'staggered' propo-
sal.
He then states that CND does
not feel that N A T O should
immediately disarm itself.
Indeed, he implies that we would
.be justified in trying to hide
under a nuclear umbrella pro-
vided by other nations, while
not contributing to that force
ourselves. This seems strange,
particularly as C N D want
Britain to leave NATO.
He concludes by saying that
people must individually decide
whether 'unilateral disarmament
by Britain would make war more
likely.' The only conclusion
possible after reading his diatribe,
is yes.

UGM wrecked
by A-A fire?
Dear Sir
I have just left yet another
U G M wrecked by the Anti-
Apartheid movement, not the
first occasion this has occurred.
No business was discussed at the
last UGM, or A G M of last year
because A - A challenged the
quorum on opening, because
they were frightened of losing-i
This time they tried to black-
mail the U G M into accepting
that' their motion be heard (a
similar one has already been
defeated this year) by threaten-
ing to challenge the quorum
thereby preventing the elections
from behing held, if this was not
so. RSM opposed this pro-
cedural motion with the same
threat. Someone else decided to
challenge the quorum, I know
not his allegiance.
What I am trying to say is:
Don't these people (particularly
A-A) care about this Union? Are
we to have these elections
hanging on until next year? Will
the same stupid and mindless
behaviour happen at the AGM?
Are the members of the A-A
group so unconcerned about IC
democracy yet so concerned
with South African democracy?-

PS: I was going to support the
A-A motion until this incident,
had their motion been heard I
would have voted against it
subsequently.
Democracy
at work
Dear Martin
I was present at the SCC
meeting which decided to restrict
the number of candidates in the
College's own 'General Election'
to only those sponsored by the
three main political societies, not
surprisingly this motion was
only supported by those socie-
ties. This prevents any other
member of the Union standing
as a candidate, even though he
may be fully seconded etc.
I learned at school that one of
the major features of a demo-
cracy, which distinguished it
from a totalitarian regime, is
that it holds elections with an
unrestricted choice of candi-
dates, so that the voters can
choose the person they want, not
the person imposed upon them.
In Russia, elections are held but
all the candidates are party
members. It seems that Consoc,
Socsoc and Libsoc in this unholy
alliance have taken us closer to
totalitarianism by their denial of
the freedom of choice.
Abstain on June 2.

Flat rates
i
Dear Martin
Last week the Student Resi-
dence Committee recommended
large rent rises for the Southside
penthouse flats, claiming that
unlike the Head Tenancies, these
flats do not exist as a service to
students but 'as a means of
screwing as much money out of
them as possible.' (I quote.)
Perhaps it would be cynical to
point out that the College could
profit even more if it were to
broaden its outlook, put the flats
on the open market and screw
money out of the general public
instead. But at least the method
of applying for these flats could
be changed; this year a large
number of students (myself
included) wasted a lot of time
filling in Head Tenancy applica-
tion forms for flats which are
now outside most undergradu-
ates price range. If the College
must auction its assets, it would
be polite to let us know in
advance.
Yours

Dear Martin
I must take great issue with
your report on the front page of
last week's FELIX. Not only did
you report the incident happen-
ing in the wrong bar on the
wrong day but you also got the
wrong number of people.
It suffices to say that all
disputes have two sides 40 them
and that I am not in the business
of making unprovoked attacks
(physical or otherwise) on any
person, least of all on Mr
Goulder. One must however
question the integrity of a person
(ie Mr Goulder) who uses the
authority of his position to
further personal arguments.
We all know that as President
of ICU Mr Goulder looks upon
the rank and file student as the
scum of the earth and believes
that he has the same social
standing as God. Mr Goulder
has been on a year's ego trip, not
giving a damn for the fun loving
students. When one tells him to
get off his high-horse, stop being
pompous, and do something
useful, he becomes rather
abusive and puts one on his list
of personal enemies.
Like so many other Presidents,
once elected, Mr Goulder has
distanced himself from students,
kept important information
affecting ICU secret, generally
thinks that he has a 'cushy' job,
and does not want to antagonise '
College authorities by standing
up for those who elected him.
Mr Goulder has by no means
been a decent or successful
President, but then what does
one expect from a man who
threatened to take ICU to court?
Yours sincerely
