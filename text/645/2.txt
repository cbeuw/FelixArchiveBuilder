Expose QEC
Dear Martin
I agree wholeheartedly with
Gabrielle Shields that, while
naked men on the front page of
FELIX is a Good Thing, your
choice of subject is not. However,
it is not enough to choose
someone who is fantastically
attractive. Personality, wit and
intelligence are also required to
avoid the whole idea degenerat-
ing into a cattlemarket. Unfor-
tunately, in my experience, there
are no men with all the necessary
qualities at IC. But do not
despair, there is someone—your
delicious friend Mike from QEC.
Although he is probably too shy
to pose for the front page
suitably undre: ^d, I'm still
hoping you can use your hypno-
tic powers to persuade him to do
so.
Yours in anticipation

Quis Questionet?
Dear Martin
In Robert Kelsey's statistics
on his so-called 'Peace Canvass
83' in last week's edition he
seems to have overlooked an
important point concerning
question five. This asks Tf there
was a General Election tomor-
row would nuclear disarmament
be an important issue for you?'
Robert states that 63% of people
said yes. Yet out of the 258
questionnaires posted under the
doors of Weeks and Selkirk-
Tizard Halls ony nine of them
were returned. So under 4% of
these' people thought that the
nuclear issue was important
enough to warrant filling in the
CND questionnaire. Could it be
that people were saying yes to
the verbal questions simply to
| get rid of the canvasser?
Yours sincerely

Error-ridden
Exposition?
Dear Sir
Having read the article by
Robert Kelsey in the latest
FELIX, I feel I must write to
answer some of the mistaken
and misguided statements he
makes. I will treat them in the
order in which they occur:
Mr Kelsey states that an
accidental start to a nuclear war
is "inevitable unless the arms
race is halted". Does he have
any idea of the vast maze of
safeguards, double, treble and
quadruple checks, and agree-
ments between people in differ-
ent places that is required to
launch a single missile? Evidently
not. The precautions are such
that one is almost made to doubt.
if an intentional launch is
possible let alone an accidental
one!
Next, he states that "the
notion that we must arm our-
selves to negotiate from a
'position of strength' (that we
must arm ourselves to achieve
disarmament) is blatantly
contradictory". However, he
fails to state why it is contra-
dictory and, indeed, he would be
hard pushed so to do: He need
only think back to those long-
past days at school to remember
how he listened to the guy of
equal size and strength who told
him not to call names whilst
greeting similar instructions
from the little weakling with
only more insults.
Mr Kelsey's next oversight is a
mere practical detail: He
suggests getting rid of a propor-
tion of our missiles unilaterally
in order that we may 'see if the
Russians respond' by recipro-
cating the gesture. What would
happen if, having been given,
free of charge, a small shift of
the balance of power in their
favour, the Russians didn't
respond by giving away their
unexpected windfall? With new
weapons systems taking years to
design and procure, we would be
left in a weakened position for a
considerable time.
Our friend next proceeds to
display his lack of understanding
of Britain's independent deter-
rent. After stating the obvious
and irrelevant fact that we are
not an "Imperial power" (by
which I understand him to mean
the country and not this college),
he says that Polaris and Trident
are a waste of money as "no way
could we use them without
consulting NATO". Whilsfwe in
all probability would consult
with NATO, the whole value of
an independent deterrent is that
it gives the Warsaw Pact an extra
decision maker to consider. Even
I M a y 20,
if they judged that the US would
not take nuclear action in the
defence of Europe, they could
never be certain that Britain
wouldn't. This is the only value
of Polaris and Trident: In terms
of numbers they constitute only
a tiny fraction of the West's
armoury.
The most blatant inaccuracy
in Mr Kelsey's error-ridden
exposition on nuclear arms in
the statement that "the British
government has rejected sugges-
tions of a dual-key approach" to
the launch control of Cruise.
Only the other day I. and. if I'm
not mistaken, Mr Kelsey himself,
listened to his friend-in-arms.
(excuse the pun). Prof Mike
Pentz of SANA making long-
winded reference to Mr Hesel-
tine's statements on TV about
the ways in which dual-key
procedure was to be imple-
mented.
Next we have the inevitable
and touching but irrelevant and
incorrect reference to Hiro-
shima: "Japan has no nuclear
weapons, and they have more
reason than any other country to
protect themselves from a
nuclear attack."
Having proved himself ig-
norant of the facts in a remark-
ably wide range of nuclear
issues, Mr Kelsey clinches the
case against himself by proving
that he doesn't even understand
the basic concept of deterrence
before going on to state: "the
logical extension of peace
through strength is that every
country in the world has nuclear
weapons." Whilst I have, at
times, found his reasoning just a
little difficult to follow, I must
admit that in this case, the
system of logic which he uses
completely escapes me. Whilst it
may sound conceited to say so,
the NATO and Warsaw Pact
countries have a rather high
degree of political stability and
slronger instincts of self-
preservation and restraint than
some tin-pot dictatorships and
revolutionary juntas scattered
around the world and are thus
more suitable custodians of such
immense power. Also, their
circumstances as the two main
world power blocs are unique
and, thus, so are defence require-
ments.
Having struggled to prove in
this letter that Red Rob's
reasoning wasn't all it might be,
I now see that I needn't have
bothered: In his last paragraph,
he reveals the method behind his
madness: "Remember your
humanity and forget the rest."

Hungry Russia
Dear Martin
If I have correctly interpreted
the comments Mr Kelsey made
in paragraph three of his article
last week, he regards the USA
and USSR as acting equally
reprehensibly in world affairs.
He is quite right—it does depend
on where you stand. From my
vantage point, the position is
pellucidly clear: the Soviet
Empire is the enemy, not
America.
It's about time we realised the
truth about Russian foreign
policy Lenin declared 'war with
the bourgoisie is sooner or later
inevitable. But the enemy must
not know when we shall strike'.
More recently, Alexander Sol-
zhenitsyn reminded us that one
aim of Soviet foreign policy is
world domination. Since the
1917 Revolution, the USSR has
swallowed Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Czecho-
slovakia, East Germany, Hun-
gary and Afghanistan. Soviet
client states include such 'peace
loving' nations as Cuba and
Vietnam, both of whom are
currently conducting wars on the
Soviet's behalf in several areas of
the world.
On the subject of The Bomb,
let us not forget that in the
immediate post-war period, the
Americans did not use their
nuclear monopoly to force
Russia to disgorge the countries
it had swallowed in the wake of
Hitler's collapse, but when the
USA, in a conciliatory gesture,
removed all its ICBMs from
Britain, Italy'and Turkey after
the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,
Moscow responded by doubling
her number of ICBMs. Simi-
larly, when President Carter
cancelled the B l Bomber,
Moscow continued to build the
strategic Backfire Bomber. We
might also ask why a largely
landlocked country like USSR
needs an enormous Navy, and
why the Warsaw Pact countries
built up a massive stockpile of
chemical weapons when the
West stopped manufacturing
them.
I hope that these facts and
awkward questions will help you
to put things in perspective when
CND's leaders next tell us about
the 'peace-loving' Soviet Union!
Yours controversially

PS: The Papal Envoy's remarks
about Mgr Kent should not
come as any surprise. The Pope
knows better than most, the true
nature of life under Soviet
domination!
