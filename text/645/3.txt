Jonathan Miller is to act as
Union President during Stephen
Goulder's absence later this
term. At a meeting last week the
Union Executive offered the
Acting Presidency to Mr Miller,
who is currently chairman of
Jonathan Miller
Social Clubs Committee, during
Mr Goulder's absence in Hol-
land between May 29 and June
3.
The Executive's decision is an
unusual one, in that normally
one of the other sabbatical
officers or a Constituent College
Union President would be asked
to deputise for the ICU Presi-
dent. At this time of year,
however, the CCU Presidents
have exams, and the Executive
(which consists of the Union
President, Vice-President,
Honorary Secretary and the
C C U Presidents) apparently
preferred not to offer the job to
the year's Hon Sec Andy Grim-
shaw. The Deputy President,
John McCallion, is not a sab-
batical officer and has final
exams in June.
Accompanying Mr Goulder
on his trip to Holland will be
James Boucher, the Academic
Affairs Officer. They will be
attending the week-long Inter-
national Conference for Stu-
dents of Technology in Delft, to
discuss 'Energy and Natural
Resources' at a probable cost of
some sixty pounds each. Apart
from the usual dinners, sight-
seeing tours and parties, they
will be attending lectures on
such subjects as 'The problems
of borderland inhabitants to
exert influence on the policy-
making of neighbour countries
with regard to energy and
environment' by one Dr B
Kwiatlowska. The aim of the
conference is apparently to
'Internationalise the Views of
Students'.
