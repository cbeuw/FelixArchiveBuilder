HEALTH SERVICE
SLAMS UNION BAR
Dr Tessa Addenbrooke of the
College Health Service has
expressed grave disquiet over the
standards of hygiene in the
Union Bar. In a letter to
Refectory Manager Victor
Mooney and to the Chairman of
the Bar sub-committee Stephen
Goulder, she pointed out that
the store behind the bar is
neither suitable nor clean
enough when it is taken into
account that food as well as
drink is sold over the bar. She
stressed, however, that there was
no question of closing the bar
down.
Mr Goulder said that the
matter would receive attention
over the quiet summer period.

Catch 22
The 22 Club is to be charged a
two hundred pound deposit for its
next formal dinner in College,
because it already owes the
refectories over a thousand
pounds from two previous dinners.
The Club was formed, as its
name suggests, in 1922 and since
then has gone steadily downhill.
Its aim of 'Promoting Fellow-
ship among past and present
members of the Royal College of
Science' is now based on various
dinners and barnights at which
members eat (a little), drink (a
lot) and are merry (all over the
Union Bar floor). In this it bears
a strong resemblance to Links
and Chaps, its City and Guilds
and RSM counterparts. Mem-
bers can be recognised by a blue,
claret and white striped tie on
Wednesdays and slurred speech
on Fridays.
Union Officers expressed
surprise that the club's booking
was accepted at all, considering
the club is so deep in debt to the
refectories and to the Union
Print Unit. But they were
enlightened when they dis-
covered that not only is College
Registrar Peter Mee a member of
the club—so is Refectory Mana-
ger Victor Mooney.

Last week's Union General
Meeting ground to a premature
halt after two separate factions
had threatened to call quorum
unless they had their way.
The meeting was obviously
inquorate when Chairman Nick
Pyne opened at 1:09pm last
Thursday with an appeal to
postpone quorum-calling until
after the elections for Union
posts. But as soon as the
Officers' Reports had been
made, David Hodes demanded
that the Anti-Apartheid motion
be heard before the elections or
he would challenge the quorum.
Tim Williams, Vice-President-
elect of the Royal School of
Mines Union, then said that he
was at the meeting to ensure that
this motion would not be passed,
and threatened to call quorum if
it was heard at all.
In the event, the meeting was
closed when the quorum was
challenged from another corner.
Richard Robinson, a second-
year chemist, took this step to
'put a stop to this moral black-
mail'. Mr Robinson then had to
Stephen Goulder, flanned by
Guilds hit squad at last Satur-
day's Rag Fete
No.6451
beat a hasty retreat to avoid the
wrath of offended Union hacks;
Nick Pyne attempted to imple-
ment 'unofficial Union policy'
by throwing him in the Round
Pond. Surprisingly, no such
policy had been passed con-
cerning David Hodes or Tim
Williams.
