At Hastings on Whit-Saturday the sun shone,
the sky was blue, and I.C. l o s t the t o s s . This
was the ominous prelude to 45 minutes' cricket
during which East Sussex scored 80 runs before
the f i r s t wicket f e l l . That i s not to say that
i t should not f a l l e n before, but the f i e l d i n g ,
with one or two honourable exceptions, was poor,
and the bowling not too t i d y .
Then Wilson (4-50) and Ault (2-37) found a
length, and i n another 70 minutes the opposit-
ions were a l l out f o r 133. Lappin took 2-11 and
Reynols was ill-rewarded with 1-33.
A f t e r tea I.C. began unfortunately. Clapp
snicked one to the wioket-keeper In-the f i r s t
over, and Wyles was f o o l i s h l y run out. A stand
between Oldland and Waterland (30), i n spite of
some comical running between wickets, saved the
Innings from ignominy. Some;sturdy h i t t i n g by
Rambaut promoted i t to affluence, and when the
captainleft f o r 28 the score was i n the n i n e t i e s .
Serem and Oldland had taken i t to over 120 before
the l a t t e r was caught f o r an excellent 40. Sev-
eral wickets then f e l l p r e e l j a t a t e l y , and the
advent of Rowly Reynolds did not inspire all ex-
cess of optimism among I.C. supporters. However
t h i s worthy warrior smote an unexpeoted four,and
a soampered leg-bye brought v i c t o r y with 2 wiokets
and f i v e minutes to spare, As the Duke of Well-
ington said i t was a damned close run thing.

A N E P I C S Q U A S H M A T C H
On March 14th, the f i n a l of the White ley
Cup tournament was played between Jeff Kenyon
(holder 1948, 49, 50) and Arthur Wright, Kenyon
winning 6-9, 0-9, 10r 8, 10-8, 9-7. Wright had
only been beaten once since coming to I.C. t h i s
year, and had beaten Kenhon 3-1 i n the i n t e r -
college match at Christmas.
From t h e start the game was played a t a t e r r -
i f i c pace, Wright using a i l his speed and accurate
d r i v i n g to put Kenyon o f f his drop shots. He
won the f i r s t two games, the second i n a single
hand, and went ahead to 8-3, lanatch point , i n
the t h i r d game. However, Kenyon found his touch
and fought back tooth and n a i l to win the game
10-8. In the f o u r t h game Wright again v;ent ahead
to match point 8-5, but once more Kenyon found a
streak of b r i l l i a n c e and won at 10-8.
The f i f t h game found both men exhausted,but
with no l e t t i n g up i n the pace - Kenyon appeared
to keep going by w i l l power alone. The score
went evenly to 7 - a l l when a f t e r several blank
hands, Kenyon f i n a l l y won at 9-7,
Great credit must go to Kenyon 'for his t e r r -
i f i c f i g h t i n g recovery, and for s t i c k i n g to his
bes.i type of game i n spite of the pace. Wright
played with his usual speed and determination,
and must be considered very unfortunate not to
have won i n the t h i r d or fourth games. The
match Has played i n an admirable s p i r i t , both
men having impeccable court manners, and pro-
vided the spectators with the most t h r i l l i n g
exhibition of high class squash that has been
seen here f o r years.
L A W N T E N N I S
The opening of the Lawn Tennis season, whioh
seems now doomed to be the hast, has been success-
f u l . One match, played i n a lighthearted vacat-
ion s p i r i t , was l o s t , but the remainder have been
won. The most important was the win over St.
Bart's Hospital by 9-0, which carried I.C. through
the preliminary round ofthe U.L. Cup. The 7-2
win at New College, Oxford was also notable; I.C.
were without Wright as he had been picked to play
for Surrey, f o r whioh we should l i k e to take t h i s
opportunity of congratulating him.
The most i n t e r e s t i n g matoh of the season has
been the Inter-College match between R.C.S. and
C.&G., played on the college courts on Sunday,May
6th. Guilds started favourites and won 3 or the
4 singles rubhers.* The long-awaited match between
Wright and Spenoe-Bate was somewhat disappointing
as both men seemed to wait f o r each other's mist-
akes rather than go f o r the winning shots which
the tea-time orowd was expecting.
The three doubles matches provided the ten-
sion f o r whioh h o s t e l dwellers were waiting, and
which, I must venture to add, I f e e l the bowling
club w i l l r a r e l y be able to provide. Your scribe
and h i B partner, a f t e r some extraordinarily bad
play, l o s t t h e i r rubber to a v i r i l e R.C.S. t h i r d
pair; and Wright and partner appeared determined
to do the same thing. The r e s u l t of the matoh
depended upon whether Smith and Ward of Guilds
could beat Watson and Spence-Bate of R.C.S. who
won gamely, continuing despite a sprained ankle.
A f t e r a hectic struggle every point being cheered
by r i v a l groups among the spectators, the i l l d s
p a i r triumphed, thus winning the matoh 4-3.

On Saturday, 12th. May, i n glorious sunshine
and with a north-westerly breeze, I.O.B.C. were
represented i n the U.L.B.O. Allom Oup Regatta by
the 2nd. Junior Eight rowing i n the C l i n k e r
D i v i s i o n . Drawn against U.0.& H., 1.0. had a
somewhat scratchy row and U.C. going away at the
start drew slowly ahead to win by 3 lengths.
Meanwhile, the 1st. Eight had spent the
morning having an outing with Leander. A f t e r
the reorganisation f o l l o w i n g the Head, the Eight
i s s e t t l i n g down and shaping quite w e l l . I f
f u l l advantage i s taken of the outings with
Leander to s i t baok at the f i n i s h w h i l s t the
hands go away, and the orew oontlnue to Improve,
i t should prove a d i f f i c u l t orew to beat i n the
Thames Oup.
