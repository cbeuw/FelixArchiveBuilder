Kamporama Featuring
Spank-ICU 20.11.92
'Fuck the bastard that keeps
screaming shite!' moaned the flared
and platformed singer.
Spank are a great band to heckle
because they look so upset when
you do it.
It's possible to get away with
playing well and looking crap
(Therapy?/Radiohead)—it's even
possible to get away with playing
crap but looking quite good
(Curve/Slowdive).
Spank look like Gary
Glitter/EMF crossover hopefulls.
They try to sound like the new
Sugarcubes material. They succeed
in sounding like something Paul
Morton knocked up in his shed.
This is more than likely to be the
reason behind the drunken Irish
abuse.
They were a token effort, but I
enjoyed it. I enjoyed heckling them
at least.
Let's just hope no one signs them.
Glyph.

Wax Equations, Blade,
Senser - ULU 20/11/92
Being loud does not impress me.
Anybody can do it. Senser should
know this. The majority of people
seem to agree with me. Its such a
shame really because what they're
doing ain't half bad, if only you
could hear it.
Blade, variously described as one
of the most respected British
rappers, or a complete joke of a
human being, manages to entertain
simply by walking on stage. He's
actually enjoying being here. This
makes me happy. People will
remember him. But will they
remember what he said? I regret to
say that I doubt it. When he gets off
the stage and joins the crowd it
almost becomes a farce. When the
man with the Chinese hat gets on
stage and pretends to play the drums
it seems the most logical thing to do
Finitribe - ULU 19/11/92
After finishing helping David out
with his radio programme, I ran
rather briskly for the bus.
Embarking the bus and enquiring
apon the fare. 'Seventy pence
please' was the reply. Cheap at half
the price I'd say. Alighting at
Goodge Street I preceded, with a
skip and a hop to U L U . Breezing
at the time. People like Blade.
When somebody from the
balcony shout ot 'rap is crap' I
cringe. Do people realy have mind
that closed, eyes that blinkered, to
say things like that? 'Fuck the
Government.' They are the least of
our problems, they can be changed.
People with closed minds are our
real enemy.
Where the hell have all these
people come from? They have come
to pay homage to their god. The one
and only guitar based rock. Dr
Phibes etc are either one of the best
exponents of this genre, or a
complete pile of abortion. They
could be both, at the same time. The
problem lies with the fact that
nobody here seems to be
questioning. It's all to tame.
Personally I find it all a bit tedious
and leave half way through.

past the throng, the plebs, I entered.
How Rock'n'roll.
Perhaps not. One of the finest
exponents of the musical genre
commonly know as 'progressive
house' were doing their thang. And
rather good it was too. They played
a number of toons that seemed to
please the gathered masses, and me
also. A particularly enjoyable
evening was had by all.

Television—Town & Country
Club, 19.11.92
At a time when several of the late
seventies new wave acts are
enjoying a nostalgic revival, the
reformation of Television offers the
chance of evaluating a band that
many feel were killed off with
undue haste in 1978. Originally in
the vanguard of the New York
invasion from C B G B ' s , with
Talking Heads, Blondie and The
Ramones, they enjoyed huge praise
for the debut album 'Marquee
Moon' and then suffered a critical
backlash and after the second tour
they called it quits.
Since then, frontman T o m
Verlaine has enjoyed an erratic
career, last seen in London playing
solo at the Bloomsbury Theatre
after being dumped by his record
company. I approached this reunion
at the T & C with some degree of
trepidation as the new album is a
rather lacklustre affair and after 14
years the band were now an
unknown quanity. The audience
was a mixture of faithfuls and new
recruits and what we were treated
to was a total reappraisal of the new
Pulp—Camden Palace
In a revivalist retrospective sort of
way Pulp are a wonderful early 80s
atmosphere sort of band. The sort
of band you'd gleefully have
playing at your 21st party reeling
off cover versions of Blondie, the
Jam and Adam and the Ants all
night.
However, in a 1992 'what's hip'
sort of way Pulp are misplaced like
Woody Allen is 'misplaced' in a
children's nursery.
In their favour, though, Pulp do
have good bits that sound like
World of Twist songs and as the
latter no longer exists (I only found
this out tonight, my finger having
obviously slipped off the pop pulse
over the summer) this may not be
such a band thing. The tacky bits
are sadly very tacky, the song that
sounds like T Will Survive' for
example sounds T O O M U C H like
T Will Survive' for me to listen
without wondering that Pulp's
entire repertoire wasn't borrowed
from their elder brothers' record
collections.
Every song tonight is introduced
wittily as 'this is the beginning
of...'. I think they do this to try and
make us believe that although A L L
the songs begin with the drumming
from 'Atomic' they don't all have
the same words. Picking out the
good bits from all this is a dirty job
and frankly I can't be bothered.

material with only a few glances at
the glorious past. I heard several
people remark—Tf only they had
recorded the album after the tour'.
Each number was now adorned
with the structures, inspired solos
that were the trademark of
'Marquee Moon', and the guitar
duets between Verlaine and Richard
Lloyd proved the power of the
group when they are
communicating. With microphones
draped before Vox amps, this was
the 'authentic' school of guitar
playing, but we were spared arty
self-indulgence. Tom Verlaine is
however one of the least voluble of
performers; we were several
numbers into the set before we were
greeted with 'Hello', but some
might consider this a bonus. The
encores helped to satisfy those who
had come to relive the heady days
of '77, but the real statement of the
concert was that Television are back
with new energy and a creative
chemistry that should ensure that
their second union continues to be
fruitful. Next time, how abou*
recording the album live?
