Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Declan Curry draws back the curtain of mystery on our secrets.
Funny things happen on the road to
and from Westminster. The
Department for Education last week
published its now infamous league
tables, giving sometimes erroneous
information on the exam
performances of secondary school
students. With some parents and
teachers denouncing the tables, the
Prime Minister launched a strident
defence. 'It is information that
legitimately ought to be available to
parents,' said M r Major. 'Every
democrat should welcome its
publication.'
Was the publication on the same
day that the Metropolitan Police
called on Mr Alan Clarke about the
little matter of his evidence to the
Matrix Churchill trial? And didn't
Mr Clarke . .er.. tell the truth at the
trial? O f course, not one
Government minister was involved
in any sort of cover up. Four of
them were. M r Kenneth Clarke
QC, President Michael Heseltine,
The Right Honorable Malcolm
Rifkind and plain Tristan Garel-
Jones all signed 'public interest
immunity' certificates, designed to
withhold evidence from the trial. As
for the Prime Minister? It's just one
of those things Mrs Thatcher didn't
tell him about.
The truth of the matter seems to
lie in Whitehall documents, whether
seen by the Prime Minister or not.
These documents may be examined
by the inquiry of Lord Justice Scott.
Should they be open to
parliamentary and, indeed, public
scrutiny? Mark Fisher, Labour M P
for Stoke Central, thinks they
should. The day before Inspector
Knacker visited Alan Clarke, M r
Fisher introduced a Freedom of
Information Bill in the House of
Commons. Such a bill would force
the disclosure of the documents that
would establish which ministers
knew what when in the Iraqgate
affair. M r Fisher said 'Iraqgate
focuses the spotlight in a way it has
never been focused before.'
Mr Fisher added that the bill also
establishes a 'public interest'
defence in trials under the Official
Secret Act. This would allow civil
servants to act as whistle blowers
where government impropriety
occurs. Famous whistle blowers
include Sarah Tisdall, Clive Ponting
and Bill Goodwin. Not that we can
mention the Official Secrets Act, as
it is apparently a secret. As is the
D- notice, that wonderful system of
self censorship, patrolled amazingly
by the media. A bit like the lobby,
the last haunt of the retiring figure
of John Cole.
The Fisher Bill, which has cross
party support, covers central and
local government and their
contractors, public bodies such as
hospitals, health authorities and
schools, and some information held
by larger private sector companies.
Information may be withheld on
grounds of security, international
relations and policy advice to
ministers. Combine all three and
you get Iraqi arms sales.
Mr Fisher thinks that his
campaign will be successful, with
the Bill getting a second reading in
the Commons in February. Maurice
Frankel, director of the Campaign
for Freedom of Information,
expresses his support. 'Lack of
Freedom of Information makes
Britain a retarded democracy', he
says. 'Accountability cannot be
weakened by more information. All
that would be undermined is the
government's ability to withhold
information simply because it might
be embarrassing.' Roy Hattersley,
former Shadow Home Secretary,
adds 'free people have the right to
know the truth, the right to know
the decisions which have been taken
in their name'.
