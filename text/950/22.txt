IC Golf Scullers ICFC 1 in 2nd Round
The first part of the season is over,
with the IC team once again
progressing to the second stage of
the U A U championships.
The season in fact started with a
disappointing 5-1 loss away to a
strong Reading University team,
who ended up clear group winners.
We were therefore aiming for
second place in the group. Victories
over Brunei University, Kings
College and Charing Cross and
Westminster set up an exciting final
match against RHBNC, with IC
needing 3 of the 6 points to ensure
qualification. This match, played at
Porters Park G C ended IC 3Vi,
R H B N C 2'/2, with three matches
going to the final hole.
We are looking forward to the
next stage of the U A U
championships in the spring term.
In the meantime, well done to all
involved, particularly those coming
into the team this season.
Team from: Ed Smith, Rob
Keyte, Jan Philp, Paul Mercie,

Greenshields.
The Club's single scullers took a
break from long-distance Tideway
training with a race at Tiffin Small
Boats Head on Saturday 21st. Eight
competed in both the morning and
afternoon against-the-clock
divisions, finishing well up in the
very strong field. Their relative
order finished between division,
many athletes putting in good
personal performances in the event
that was won overall by an ex-IC
oarsman, Guy Pooley, by some
distance.
Most notable were the
performances of John Warnock
who was the fastest Imperial sculler
both times, finishing 8th overall,
close to some of the country's top
national squad scullers and Andy
Roberts, a newcomer to IC who
won the novice pennant in the first
run.
The squad's strongest oarsmen
will be completing the first half of
their winter assessment in pairs and
singles trials at Henley next
weekend.
IC Badminton Club
Last weekend Imperial College
Badminton team made its way to
Nottingham for the annual
individual championships. The
team, consisting of six men and six
ladies, were to face the best of
British badminton students. There
was one new addition to the men's
team, Raymond Yeng, and two in
the ladies', Madhu Bhatuta and
Katie Brocolli from St Mary's.
The first day was the start of the
singles and as expected our players
fell in the early rounds with only
Barbara Spence advancing to the
third round. The team hoped to do
better in the doubles and mixed.
Day two started well with all three
men's pairs winning their opening
rounds. In the 2nd round though
Alan Crow and Richard Wangy
Langy met with a seeded pair from
Exeter and were beaten
convincingly while Stephen Truffle
and Raymond Yeng lost to their
Strathclyde counterparts. Jin-Yee
Lim and C L Tan stormed their way
to the third round and now had to
face a seeded Nottingham pair.
They started well in both sets
leading 7-4 and 9-5 but failed to
capitalise on serve and eventually
lost 15-7, 15-9.
In the ladies' doubles high hopes
rested on our top pair Barbara
Spence and Wendy Yates. The
realtively inexperienced Jennifer
Lam and Madhu Bhabuta put up a
fight before losing in the opening
round while the new partnership of
Uta Boltze and Katie Brocolli found
the going got tough in round two.
Barbara and Wendy continued their
winning streak as expected but in
the third round were surprised by
an unknown Bedford College pair.
They only wished they hadn't eaten
that slice of chocolate cake on the
way up.
Again the mixed the combination
of Langford and Yates were quietly
confident of getting into the finals.
In round three they lost the first set
easily but suddenly came alive when
Richard remembered the 'wild
thing' gag from Oliver Reed on
'The Word' the night before and
subsequently took the 2nd. Despite
leading 7-4 in the rubber set, a
series of errors accounted for their
elimination. Had they both had
vindaloos for dinner the night
before, the end result might have
been different.
On the team championships both
the men and ladies have won their
way to the last 16 round.
On the home front the club has
appointed Liam Hudson (the guy
with the ponytail) as social secretary
and he has suggested a Christmas
outing for Friday 11th November so
look out on the noticeboard.
Amongst others on his agenda is a
ten-pin bowling trip and a cinema
trip.

Treble hopes continue for IC! After
qualifying for the second round of
the U A U and going top of the
league last week. IC lsts outplayed
U C L to reach the quarter-finals of
the U L cup.
Despite going down after a
shabbily defended corner, IC then
produced some quite literally
breathtaking one touch football
which earned them an equaliser
shortly after the half-time restart.
IC continued to dominate but
failed to score. U C L then went
ahead thanks to the referee totally
ignoring the U C L players camping
in IC's box. Despite the heroic
attempts of M Atherton and B
Willis (guesting from the 3rds in the
absence of Richard 'No Woman'
Bruce) to keep them out.
The inevitable equaliser was the
product of the best move of the
match, culminating in a superlative
cross by J Mottashed expertly
turned in my R Martinez.
The match went to extra time
thanks to a save from often
overlooked keeper M Atherton. The
save, it was reported by a bystander
was 'possibly the best save ever
seen'.
The extra time was full of
incidents, the main talking points
being T Botzio's triple pike dive
with tuck, earning him straight tens
and the U C L midfielder an early
shower.
IC's class and composure
prevailed: A Fenton, T Robson, B
Willis and R Burrows formed a
solid back four, R Dixon, R
Martinez, S Watson and T Botzios
stroked the ball around beautifully
in midfield. J Mottashed and A
Galloway roamed menacingly up
front and their unselfish play earned
IC two further goals to give IC a 4-2
win and a place in the 2nd round
draw.
Rugby 1st and 2nds
IC went out of the Gutteridge Cup
in the first round against U C L on
Wednesday.
A wet pitch and gale force wind
didn't help, and neither did the fact
that IC lost captain Rupert Carr in
the pre-match warm up after Ollie
'Supersub' Dennison split his eye
open with a superbly timed right
hook.
Mark Wisheart took the Hooker's
shirt and IC got off to a flying start
soaring, two tries through George
Habib's 'poetry in motion' style
running.
IC should have extended their
lead soon after when Nick Flynn
was topped a foot short by a U C L
player with a 'he can't run without
his Adam's apple' attitude to
talking.
U C L replied with a try from the
base of an IC scrum when their
scrum-half spoiled Andrew 'he
pushed me, ref!' Montgomery's
pass. Stuart 'sulking bastard'
Paynter kicked his only points of the
day with a penalty and the half
closed 13-5 to IC.
U C L , playing with the wind,
dominated the second half and
kicked a penalty before scoring
their second try through their No. 8.
IC threw everything into attack
but centres Anton 'the pass was
shit' fields and Richard 'three fights
a match' Stubbs couldn't break
through. U C L kicked another three
points to leave the final score IC 13,
U C L 18.
2nds 22 - CITY UNIVERSITY 0
The game started extremely well
with a few good drives after kick
off, Simon Wilkinson, broken
armed second row, made his first
try for IC early on but City came
straight back and almost stopped
our initial celebrations. The next
try, by displaced Firsts captain
Roger Gilchrist, came after one of
the numerous backs runs, made by
clean ball from the hard driving
forwards. Also returning from
injury, Captain Rich (Chunky)
Clemey inspired many drives from
up front, closey supported by John
Roebuck, abrasive John Cassidy
and T i m savigar - who
manufactured a try for himself later
in the second half.
Matt Toolan, second row, created
much ground with a couple of
storming runs. And it was a
momentous run, after a good pass
from Roger, which Karl Drage
undertook on the wing to smash
home his first try as vice captain.
The kicks, as usual, were taken by
Lee Jefferson - who made the most
of the inconsiderate placing of the
trys - and he notched up another two
points onto this years total.
