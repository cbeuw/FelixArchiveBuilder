Editorial
The OSC mafia
One of the greatest assets of
Imperial College is the wealth of
cultures that gather to study here.
Even though we have many
disadvantages, racism is much less
prevalent in our hallowed halls,
than in the rest of the British
University system. These two facts
are not unconnected; knowledge of
a foreign country destroys
prejudice; familiarity does not breed
contempt, it builds lasting
friendships and understanding.
Unfortunately with a melting pot
of cultures comes other conflicts;
last week's incident in the JCR was
just another example in the
continuing saga, as anyone who has
been here for an extended period of
time will tell you. Into this morass
of difficulties comes the Overseas
Students Committee, given the job
of representing and organising these
societies in College. Not an easy job
at the best of times but mix in a
liberal dose of ethnic tension and it
becomes impossible.
Consquently, it is not surprising
that the Overseas Student
Committee Chairman chooses to
take issue with trivial and
uncontestable points in last week's
front page news story; it is not
shocking when all three sides
complain about the number of
column inches their side of the story
received; and tiresomely predictable
when the Malaysian Society write
a banal letter of complaint about an
uncontentious news story buried on
the second page concerning changes
in catering law.
All in all, I am not overwhelmed
by the fact that OSC tends to act like
a mafia, but I would rather they
didn't. Whether OSC likes it or not
political differences are part of
other country's culture; the
discussion of these issues is part of
the education of both British and
other foreign students. Surely it is
better to have that debate than not.
No one believes tourist brochures;
it is better to deal with the realities,
otherwise what could be a rich,

worthwhile collection of cultures
becomes a triviality.
CCU Rags
Having become the object of all the
ire among C C U hacks it is only fair
to redress some of the balance.
Rachel, Max and Andrew, the
editors of the various C C U organs
are doing a surprisingly good job,
surprising because of the level
facilities they have to hand and that
the efforts of the majority of their
predecessors were so poor. It is
easy to criticise, but how many
other people at Imperial can say
they have produced a regular
newspaper? A point which many
other members of CCU's should
take note of.
Union wonderful shock
I can officially declare that
Imperial College Union has the
most wonderful finance officer in
the entire world. I must confess a
smidgeon of self interest, but I did
recieve a much needed cheque mere
minutes after asking for it, for that,
thank you.

J C R O u t r a g e
O p e n Letter to the C h a i r of the
C o l l e g e A t h l e t i c s C o m m i t t e e
Dear Mr Chairman,
We are writing to express our
deep concern regarding the
proposed Sports Centre pricing
policy in relation to IC students and
staff.
Before we set out our detailed
criticism may we quote the
Managing Director from the
'Network' of May 1992, from the
article entitled, 'Sports Centre
Improvements':
'It must be stressed that students
and staff will not be paying for the
refurbishment, any more than the
users of the Day Nursery have been
expected to pay for its recently
completed refurbishment. We are
simply seizing the opportunity to
improve the facilities on offer for
everyone who studies or works at
the College.'
If these are the Managing
Director's views, how is it that
increases of such magnitude are
being proposed? For example, for
a member of staff the annual season
ticket for the gymnasium and
swimming last year cost £40; for
next year, four three-monthly
season tickets for peak time use
would cost £ 1 6 0 ; an increase of
300%! The proposed increases are
made even more dramatic when
compared with recent staff salary
awards (4.5%) and the increasing
financial difficulties of students
seeking to survive on loans and
maintenance grants frozen in 1991.
On joining the College, students
and staff are offered a total package,
which includes sports facilities. If
this package is eroded by increasing
the prices for the use of these
facilities over and above the rate of
inflation, it will be a significant
disincentive to future recruitment of
both students and staff.
Other comments regarding the
proposed scheme are as follows:
1. a peak/off peak differential
should not be established for
College users who may not have the
option of using the Centre during
off peak periods.
2. annual season tickets should
continue to be issued as before.
3. changing facilities for runners
should continue to be available.
We would be grateful if you
would raise the above matters at the
next meeting of the Athletics
Committee. If these proposals go
ahead, the so called refurbishment
will not have broadened the appeal
of the Sports Centre, rather it would
Dear Felix,
I look back at the incident in the
JCR on Wednesday (18th
November 1992) with sadness and
disgust. What I find sad is that the
objectives of an occasion such as the
Overseas Week were defeated and
what I find even sadder still, if not
disgusting, is that material such as
the controversial poster and several
other pamphlets were displayed.
I resent the fact that the Turkish
Society claimed that the material on
their stand was only being used to
promote Turkish beliefs and
culture, the objectives of the
Overseas Week (Felix, 949). I
seriously do not see how drawing
attention to the Turkish invasion of
North Cyprus in 1974 could in any
way promote the beliefs and culture
of Turkey, unless they are those
related to all invaders. However, I
would like to point out that not
putting up such material would have
avoided the particular incident from
occurring and perhaps people would
have vastly reduced its
attractiveness to College users. The
future availability of IC sports
facilities at prices comparable with
those in other College and
Universities in London is an
important issue. We would
therefore appreciate if you would
reply to this letter via the columns
have had a chance to learn more
about Turkey. The topic of the
invasion is particularly sensitive to
the Cypriots and this will not come
as a surprise to the Turkish Society
from past incidents. So I ask was
it that necessary to provoke them?
I agree with the Turkish Society
on the count that their material was
not political, but it was either
ignorance or arrogance to deny that
it was not sensitive. If it was
ignorance, they had ample time and
warning to take it down. But...
As overseas students we are given
an opportunity to introduce and
promote our respective countries
through various annual activities
such as the Overseas Week and
Overseas Night. Let us be wise in
what we choose to display and take
into consideration the feelings of
our friends around the globe. We
come from far and near, to learn,
to share and to make friends, let us
do just that.
