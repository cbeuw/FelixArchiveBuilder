Nightfall by Asimov and
Silverberg
A pre/post apocalypse scenario
played out on a world surrounded
by six suns that never let the planet
slip into darkness, except once
every 2049 years. A simple
summary of a non-too-spectacular
story that has its moments but does
not hit the mark all the way
through. Famed for his Foundation
series with it's many convolutions,
Nightfall begins well with four
groups of people uncovering the
prospect of a world in disarray in
less than a years time. This lasts for
a little under half of the book and
works well while the four groups
connect through various plausible
friends and acquaintances.
A fanatical religious organisation
predicts the coming of darkness, the
revelation of stars and the scorching
of the cities. An observatory group
denies the possibility and then
discovers deviations in their planets
orbit. An archaeologist uncovers a
hill layered with cities separated by
charcoal lines. And a psychiatrist
discovers the disastrous effects of
prolonged exposure to total
darkness. Thus the scene is set and
very nicely too.
Following the calamity comes the
restructuring of society and this is
where the boredom sets in. Not one
of the characters has become dear
to ones heart and thus the death of
even the sweetest one matters not.
It has all been done before and the
struggle of all the small groups
against the disturbing religious cult
doesn't even rattle my atheistic
brain. Overall a rather
disappointing read.

Child of Time
Silverberg
Asimov &
It was a neat idea. Bringing a
neanderthal child forward in time in
such a way that it has to remain
inside a special area. In this way the
kid cannot be taken away, is always
in precarious position.
Where the book breaks down is
in the execution. Its at least a
hundred pages too long for a single
idea to be sustained. They all have
problems accepting that he is

human, not an ape. He learns how
to eat, wash, talk and finally read.
Though this various stages his
situation changes. First he is a
scientific marvel and them when the
initial hype has died away the
anthropologists are disappointed
with the little information he yields.
Then the emotional sub-plot, that
has been simmering away just
beneath the surface erupts. What a
shame.
Technically speaking the righting
is of the high standard expected,
required almost. But that is not
enough. With the all too obvious
surprise ending the book showed
itself in its true colour, a good idea
that needed another good idea to
make a beautiful couple.

The Secret Diary of John
Major aged 4 7 % by Private
Eye
Hislop's gang doesn't seem to have
got a handle on Major's character
yet. In the beginning, the excuse
was that nobody knew who Major
was. Unfortunately, the Private Eye
satirists haven't updated their
knowledge. The result is that the
writing is neither sharp nor
amusing. It struggles to be mildly
funny, and has all the perception of
a three year old. The quick sketches
of the other cabinet figures aren't
so bad, though. 'My friend Chris'
as a conniving git? Almost as bad
as Major himself.
The saving grace is that the book
also has the last of the 'Dear Bill'
letters. Here I declare a personal
interest. I think 'Dear Bill' is
amusant comme I agneau, so much
so that I scour second hand
bookshops for past issues, like a
second rate literary prostitute. Of
course, 'Dear Bill' has the
advantage in that Sir Denis
Thatcher, Bart, is still an unknown
commodity, with the effect that
anything written about him can be
deemed within character. Not that
'Dear Bill' is about Denis at all. His
lady wife, she of 'Children in Need'
fame, is the real target, and here the
bullets sing home.
But then again, Richard Ingrams
was more subtle and humorous than
the pisspoor Hislop. Long live the
Oldie.
