House Of Love, Mercury Rev,
The Cranberrries—
Royal Albeit Hall, 20.11.92
The Cranberries. Very Dull. She
sounds a bit like Sinead O'Connor,
that's how dull it is. Where's the
bar? I know it's in here
somewhere...
There's a very strange guitar tree
at the side of the stage. It's probably
the only tree in West London which
hasn't been disfigured with
coloured lights. Shit, man, the
floor's shaking. I can see it now
'Satanic Rock Band Destroy Albert
Hall'. Eric Clapton's home hasn't
seen anything like it. Mercury Rev
don't exactly excite the crowd:
they're just sort of standing there.
They're not even swaying. I wonder
if they're enjoying it. I am. I
haven't even thought about the bar
yet, that's how good this is. A man
in a Sultans Of Ping shirt shouts
'You're shit.' A man in a Ping shirt!
There's hope yet.
Debbie Harry just walked by. She
did. The House Of Love run
through some hits. Debbie Harry's
here. The House Of Love play
'Feel', probably the best lager in the
world. Damn. And I swore I wasn't
going to mention the bar in this
paragraph. Debbie Harry's in this
building. I could have touched her.
Mercury rev-ealed
The House Of Love play
'Christine'. Debbie Harry's here.
The House Of Love do some
encores.

single 'Crush Me' is out now on
Fontana. Mercury Rev releases on

The Senseless Bottoms (in joke).
The House of Love—A View
from the Balcony
The House of Love were only in the
country for 24 hours in between a
tour of the States with Catherine
Wheel and someone else (wasn't
listening) and were keen to sell their
brilliant new album 'Bake Rainbow'
to any converts, (the mate I took
was one) with freebee 10" singles
and playing seven of the album's ten
tracks. There weren't any major
surprises—opening quietly with
'Beatles and the Stones', ending
with 'Love in a Car' building up to
a crescendo. Lots of great songs,
well played in a great venue—good
atmosphere, good acoustics =
Great Set.
The Senseless Things-
Homophobic Asshole
Why should people be persecuted
for their sexuality? Gay people
shouldn't be treated any differently
to you, me or anybody else, and that
includes probably gay or looks
camp. A n interesting point to note
about deceiving appearances, take
Morrissey: so incredibly camp, but
such a stud (great paradox—popular
with women but without macho
bullshit). It's not just about
sexuality, if you get grief for your
race, religion, culture or whatever,
simply say fuck off. You are
entitled to be who you are and
identity and free expression is a
very deep part of you; if you're
happy and comfortable with your
whole being and very existence, and
you feel that's right, then let it be.
Getting that one off my chest, the
single is brilliant. Marvel in its
anger and aggression, the punk
influence, the sheer immensity of its
power, and the almost
psychopathically visual depiction of
the attitude on James Hewlett's
cover artwork. An intense catharsis
of innermost frustrations against
individuals and society.
Based around the chance meeting
of the 'homophobic asshole' by the
band in the bar, initially thinking
him alright for his musical tastes,
but soon turned sour when he
started 'cussing gays'. By the
sounds of it, the band never told
him what they eventually thought of
him—but now they have. Bitter
sweet.

Senseless Things—Clapham
Grand
I feel like an auntie watching the
Senseless Things again. A n
extremely ashamed auntie that
hasn't been to see her sister's
gorgeous children for such a long
time. But I can still make up for last
time now can't I? I still know them
well adn they haven't really
changed that much have they?
Oh my but haven't they grown?
They've got longer hair now but I
still know it's my boys when I see
those cheeky grins from under their
fringes. Have they still got the same
toys I wonder? The ones we
enjoyed together so much on that
sunny morning in Reading two
years ago. Yes, of course they have
but they've got some lovely new
ones as well now. Big bold shiny
ones that make more noise than the
old ones and they're altogether
better boys aren't they? Much more
sensible for boys their age.
The new ones like 'Holdit
Down', 'Everybody's Gone' and
'Easy to Smile' do sound good,
very good in fact but I know I've
missed them dearly when I hardly
recognise any of their new tunes.
They still bring a lovely smile to
Auntie's face though when they sing
her favourites. 'Shoplifting' and
'Too Much Kissing' remind her of
better years gone by.
But oh dear, here's one called
'Homophobic Asshole', surely their
mother wouldn't let them sing that
one to her friends would she? I
think they're old enough to make up
their own minds don't you Auntie
Beeb?
The Senseless Things leave auntie
absolutely cold. Excellent.
