Islam - A week to learn
It is a shame that a religion, or way
of life, that represents, inspires and
motivates one-fifth of the world's
population today, has remained one
of the great mysteries of our time.
Islam is a religion of which few
non-muslims know much, yet a lot
is misunderstood and misconstrued
by many. It is for this reason that
the Islamic Society has organised an
Islamic Week between 30th
November to 4th December. This
will consist of lectures as well as a
stall in the JCR, where everyone is
welcome to attend and learn about
Islam and Muslims.
So why may you ask, should this
interest you. If we sincerely take a
few moments to judge our overall
lives, can we honestly say there is
a reason we live for? Is the nine to
five rat race all there is to life?
Yet muslims claim that they have
something that answers not only
matters to do with the individuals
but also for wider problems. There
are always those who will ridicule

Islam claiming it to be a bunch of
old stories and heresay. There are
always those who will dismiss the
existence of a creator claiming that
it is foolish, wishful thinking. There
are always those who will belittle
the objective to life, claiming life's
only purpose is to survive.
So how does one explain to the
orphaned children in Romania that
although they've had a tough time
it's actually a pointless game called
life.
So how does one explain to the
Hitching to Paris
Paris in five hours—not bad going
at all! The London region of the
student Industrial Soceity hitched
from London to Paris for Children
in Need Day, last Friday to raise
several thousand pounds for this
charity event. Ten teams went from
Imperial, with about 150 teams
from all over London and the South
East hitching in all.
This was probably the best event
that we went on with the Industrial
Society this year and is the best
weekend that most of us have spent
in the last year!
The teams gathered in Hyde Park
at 8.45am on Friday and after being
registered started on their way to the
Eiffel Tower in Paris. Photos were
taken by The Times and The
Telegraph and several people were
intereviewed by L W T , STOIC and
U C L television crews. Most of the
hitchers were in fancy dress which
helped them no end in getting
hitches to Paris. The first real
hitchers to arrive and the fastest
came from Greenwich University.
The fastest real hitchers won a
Financial Times filofax and
Eurodiary each along with eurolines
train tickets for a route of their
choice up to a certain value. They
made it in nine hours eight minutes
door to door. The first team to
arrive at the finishing point were
Maryane Walsh and Bill Quinton
(awarded the 'first cheaters to
arrive' prize) from Imperial. They
made it in just over five hours,
followed closely by James Evans
and Antonia Blewett who were
given complementary tickets by
British Midland Airways.
The fastest cheaters also came
but forced themselves to enjoy the
flight nevertheless!! The meal and
wine were both excellent and in the
bat of an eyelid (40 minutes in fact)
they had arrived at Charles de
Gaulle airport. After leaving Hyde
Park five hours previously, they had
now arrived at the Eiffel Tower,
with the whole weekend in front of
from Imperial. By sheer genius (or
maybe by being at the right place
at the right time) Rick Bilby (ICU
dep pres) and Nefyn Jones (IndSoc
chair) persuaded Air U K to give
them complementary tickets on
their last flight of the day to Paris.
They were extremely disappointed
to discover that this was their
business class Stirling Service flight
them.
Many of the hitchers gave the
organisers a helping hand and
Nefyn stayed at the finishing point
to log teams in overnight. Some of
the stories were incredible...The six
hitchers that were picked up by a
Frenchman and taken to a local bar
where he opened an account for
them, the took them home where
starving mother in the scorching
heat of Africa, who has to watch
every moment of her child starve to
death, that life is what you make it,
nothing more and nothing less.
What you live for is what you die
for.
Well Islam has news for you. It's
not!
And if this isn't enough to move
even the hardest of hearts into at
least listening to what Islam has to
say, then let me leave you to ponder
over one last point.
'What is the life of this world but
amusement and play? But verily the
Home in the Hereafter,—that is life
indeed, if they but knew.'
Quran, 29:64.
So this is the time to come and
learn about Islam. Everyone is
invited to attend and discuss their
views, at the talks or alternatively
at the stall in the JCR, throughout
the coming week.
his wife cooked them a meal and
gave them beds for the night. He
then drove them to the nearest
motorway the following morning.
As they hadn't been given a lift in
the first half an hour he paid for
them all to take the train to Paris
instead!.. .The pair that were given
a lift by a lorry dirver going to
Belgium who decided to divert his
route via Paris...The sixteen who
were given a hitch in the back of a
lorry from Calais to Paris but who
couldn't see where they were or
where they were going. The lorry
only stopped once during the three
hour trip for them to relieve
themselves! The ten hitchers that
were let on a Eurolines coach for
nothing...
Thanks must go to the Financial
Times and Moet et Chandon for the
prizes and to Air U K and British
Midland Airways for their flights as
well as to all those drivers that
picked people up on the way. All
in all it was an excellent weekend
and we'll be around to collect the
sponsorship money in the next few
days!
Anybody interested in other
Industrial Society events should
come to one of our meetings in
Chem Eng seminar room 1 at 1pm
Mondays or Fridays.
