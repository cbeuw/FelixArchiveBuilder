Term proposals
by Jonty Beavan
Investigations are taking place in
Imperial College into the possibility
of radically changing the structure
of the academic year.
A working party of the
Undergraduate Studies Group,
headed by Professor Lester
Kirschenbaum, has been charged
with finding ways to alter the
College year which could improve
the academic standing of Imperial.
The committee will provide
recommendations to the Board of
Studies and changes that are
accepted could be in place within
the next academic year.
Issues being considered at the
moment are whether to adopt the
American system of two
independent and self-contained
semesters in each year. This would
mean that students would be
examined at the end of each term
on that semester's topics, without
having to wait until the Summer to
be tested on material covered in the
Winter term. Critics of the
proposals claim that a full
understanding of the subject is lost
in the pressure of studying for each
set of tests.
Other posssibilities include
development of modular courses, so
credit gained in a course would still
be of value even if a student took
time out or transfered to another
U n i v e r s i t y .
Variations are still being
considered and Professor
Kirschenbaum is trying to
encourage student feedback.
Comparing the shake up to the
lengthening of the College day, he
commented people never knew
what the effects of changes are until
they actually happen, this was a
chance to participate in the decision-
making process. Prof
Kirschenbaum is in Chem Eng 506
and would welcome input
Library Charges
Users of the University of London
library may face charges of up to
£90 for use of its facilities next
year. The threat comes due to doubt
over whether the larger colleges in
London will continue to support the
library when they get more control
over their budgets next year. The
vice-chancellor, Professor Stewart
Sutherland, said that unless there
was enough money provided from
the colleges and institutes of the
university or extra help from the
government, the library may have
to charge individuals.
The president of the University of
London Union, Mark Samuels said
the academic work of London
students could suffer if the library
'went down the plug hole'. The
library is used by approximately
24,000 students and 2,800 staff, and
is renowned for its collections on
humanities and social sciences. It is
doubtful, however, how much
effect withdrawal of central library
facilities will have on students at
Imperial College. A number of
students questioned have
commented on the difficulty of
using the university library due to
the bureaucracy involved in
obtaining the card necessary to gain
access to the building. This process
also involves providing the library
authorities with a good reason as to
why a student wants to use the
library, a situation that many
students object to.
Science worries
Enrolments in engineering and
technology degree courses have
been described as 'disappointing' by
John Patten, the Education
Secretary. M r Patten has blamed
low enrolment on 'what is taught in
schools and how careers in
engineering are perceived', writes
Declan Curry. The Education
Secretary has encouraged
universities to 'ensure their courses
in engineering and technology
stimulate their students'.
Mr Patten was speaking at the
Birkbeck libel
recent inauguration of Nottingham
Trent University. He said that he
expected new universities to
provide a range of courses 'with
clear vocational niches', and with
'the choice of studying either part
time or full time with emphasis on
sandwich courses'. Later, the
Education Secretary said that 'with
limited public funds, universities
had to concentrate those funds to get
the best out of basic and strategic
research'.

Trade Unionists at Birkbeck
College, London, have reacted with
fury to what they regard as a
questioning of the financial honesty
of John Kerrison, the manager of
Birkbeck Union Bar. As reported in
Felices 948 and 949, a dispute has
broken out between Barbara Bates,
the Birkbeck Union President, and
David Gascoigne, a member of
Union Bar Staff. The dispute arose
following an investigation into the
finances of the bar, and it was
alleged by Ms Bates that 'a lot of
money had gone missing from the
bar'. The Bar Manager had four
formal complaints put against him
after the investigation, while Ms
Bates defeated a motion of no
confidence in her last week.
It is believed that it is a statement
refering to alleged missing bar
money which has drawn the ire of
senior officers of Birkbeck M S F
Union. In a letter to Ms Bates,
which has been released to Felix,
the Chairman of Birkbeck MSF, Dr
N H Ratnajothi, says 'after
consultation with our regional and
legal officers, lam writing formally
to request an apology and retraction
Child care worries for students
by Declan Curry
London students with children are
facing rising childcare fees and a
shortage of Day Nursery places,
according to the University of
London Union (ULU). U L U
sabbaticals have warned that
students will be hard hit as the Child
Support Act is phased in this year.
The U L U Day Nursery is
reportedly struggling to keep fees
below £ 4 0 per week.
The Child Support Act specifies
specific nursery staff to children
ratios. The ratios are calculated
according to the age of the children,
and the numbers of staff deemed
necessary to look after a number of
children in a particular age
category. These categories are
currently infant up to 2 years old,
2 to 3 years old, and 3 to 4 years
old. Infants under 2 require a
dedicated baby unit. University
College London baby unit has
warned that its places may be cut
in order to conform with the new
ratios.
Places may also be cut at the
Institute of Education Day Nursery,
and U L U Day Nursery, which does
not have a baby unit. Prices at the
U L U Day Nursery are being
increased from a current average of
£37.50 per week for students to
over £ 4 2 per week. Eleanor
Merton, Vice President of
Communication and Welfare at
U L U , has expressed concern that
students are 'giving up some of their
studies' to save on childcare costs.
Ms Merton also claimed that
government legislation to trace
absent parents 'violates the rights
o f the 'caring' parent. 'All the
government wants to do is to stop
the caring parent from claiming
benefit and to make the absent
parent pay up where the
government should. The rights of
the caring parent are being
completely squandered,' she said.
Ms Merton added that between
15-20% of student parents were
single parents. She said that the
U L U Day Nursery was the only one
in the central University of London
of the statement you released to
Felix 948, in which the financial
honesty of our member, Dr. John
Kerrison is brought into question.'
The letter then reminds Ms Bates
that she 'is fully aware that the
deliberations of the Disciplinary
Hearing held on 24 September 1992
are confidential. The information in
your possession should not have
been used by you in connection with
the no confidence motion brought
against you.'
The letter continues by reminding
Ms Bates that it was she 'who
prevented us (unions) from
discussing this issue (the
disciplinary hearings) at a recent
Trade Union Liaison Committee
meeting, claiming that we would be
in breach of confidence. Since you
have chosen to make his matter
public, I would draw your attention
to the fact that the Disciplinary
Hearing found that the question
concerning Dr Kerrison's honesty
was unsubstantiated.' The letter
then demands that Ms Bates send an
apology and retraction to Felix, and
threatens her with legal action
should she not do so.
area that was available to all
University of London students. The
Imperial College Day Nursery, in
Prince's Gardens, recently set a
fundraising target of £161,000 to
pay for a major refurbishment
programme. The programme aims
to provide a new playgroup facility,
along with a drop in area, after
school care and a school holiday
playscheme. Miss S Thornett, Day
Nursery Manager, told Felix that
work on the improvements is due
to start 'any day'. She also said that
the Day Nursery hoped not to
increase fees as a result of the new
Act, and that other ways of
financing the Day Nursery are
being explored.
