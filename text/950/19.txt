Of Mice and Men—Gary
Sinise, USA, 1992
Lennie (John Malkovich) is a huge,
strong man with the mind of a child.
George (Gary Sinise), his
resourceful friend and guardian,
leads them both to a ranch, hungry
and broke. There they find
employment but Lenny is unhappy
and longs for George's promise of
their own private farm, with
rabbits. And trouble is in store in
shape of the boss' son and his
seductive wife.
There are some excellent
performances in the film - above all
from John Malkovitch, whose
endearing Lennie is on a par with
Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The
full trajedy of Steinbeck's classic
novel is delivered, although rather
speedily, with skillful direction,
beautiful photography and a cutting
climax. Made by a theatre director,
this is a play without a stage, and
it's a good one.

P.M.T...U KILLS.
Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me
The storyline may be simple, but
the characters in this first time
director Joel Hershman's feature
includes a dildo-collecting
nymphomaniac stripper, a con-man
hiding in a trailer park, a parent-
hating Sean Young who forces her
boyfriend to marry her with a gun
and a pristine Adrienne Shelly who
kills her sister, buries her dog and
loses her virginity all in one day.
The result of this low-budget
comedy with a superb soundtrack
is hilarious and completely over the
top. A kitsch classic!

Prince of Shadows
Period thriller starring Terence
Stamp as the stern-faced, old, but
now reluctant, contract killer and
Patsy Kensit as the baby-faced
girlfriend of the man he must find
Public Eye
Joe Pesci goes from strength to
strength. From near psychotic in
Goodfellas to irritating in Lethal
Weapon and now tragic in Public
Eye. He is a freelance photographer
in 1930s New York, hired by a
dame to find information. It is
humorous and sad, well acted with
innovative photography. A bright
outlook for 1993 cinema.
Doomsday.
Amazing Grace
Winner of the Jerusalem Film
Festival, named as Best Israeli Film
of the year, Amazing Grace
portrays the relationship between
two gay men and the lives of their
families in Tel Aviv. The
pessimistic tone of the film is
illustrated by the HIV-positive
Thomas's attitude towards life and
and murder. Stylishly filmed but
unfortunately marred by its
unashamedly exploitative use (or
abuse?) of Ms Kensit. It could—
and should—have been better.
Amir R Khan.
The Story of Qiu Ju
When Qiu Ju's husband is assaulted
by a local chief, she decides first to
seek justice from the village
bureaucrats, then progressing to a
lawsuit in the big city. This unusual
story from Zhang Yimou, one of
the best directors from China, is
shot in a striking docu-drama style
which vividly portrays modern
Chinese life often with considerable
humour. Gong Li's subtle but
powerful acting impressed the Jury
at the Venice Film Festival; they
awarded her best Actress, and the
film Best Film.

his grandmother's fear of death
because of old age. Complex
emotions are sharply observed. A
sad, contemporary tale.

Henry didn't even know what chronichalitosis meant!
Candyman
Stephen King once said 'I have seen
the future of horror. His name is
Clive Barker'. Finally Barker's best
seller The Unforgiven has made the
transference to the big screen.
Candyman is a grown-up version of
Hook who hypnotises and then guts
his victims. It is up there with the
best of the modern horrors—a must
for so-called 'schlock horror fans'.
