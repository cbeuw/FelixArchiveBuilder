Cats' Eyes
Complaint
I don't think that Chris Pease of
Physics 2 can expect to me ignore
the 'light criticism' (as light as a 16
ton weight) that his 'letter'
delivered, since I am not clear as
to its intentions. Was it's purpose
to point out faults in my column or
to attack me for getting 'self-
gratification' from it? What's
wrong with self-gratification
anyway? It seems that you got
plenty of it from typing your
'letter'.
Mr Pease also moans at the personal
attacks that I have launched as well
as the crude language displayed in
my column. Well Mr Pease, F U C K
OFF.
One's home is ruined
Our economy is well and truly in
the shit, there is little hope of a
recovery within the next, ooh,
millennium or so and to top it off,
some people expect the taxpayers to
cough up god-knows-how-many
millions of pounds to repair
Windsor Castle.
The Queen was devastated at the
toasting of her favourite home and
consequently isn't thinking that
much about the bill at the moment,
although she is not exactly hard-up
is she? But since the press are full
of rumours that her advisors told the
Queen to ignore safety warnings, I
think 'gutted' more accurately
describes the Queen's feelings.
Anyway, thanks a million Queenie,
(or is it sixty million?). The fire has
Cater
Dear Jonty,
I feel compelled to write to you
regarding last week's Felix (949)
report on the Catering Laws, by Mr
S Ratnam, after a few O S C Ex-co
members expressed their
dissatisfaction to us on the matter.
I would like to make it clear that
the report was written without any
prior knowledge of the Malaysian
Society. Although S Ratnam holds
a committee post in the Society, the
situation described and the views
expressed, if any, are solely his
own. Therefore, it is obvious that
the Society has nothing to do with,
and would like to dissociate with
any debate stimulated from the
article.
The Society, however, believes
that the problem can be solved
peacefully by working closer with
the O S C , and urge all parties
affected to restrain themselves from
making any unnecessary statements
during the transition period.
Yours faithfully,
Ikhwan Helmi Herudin,
ICMS President.
given Lynn Faulds Wood and the
rest of the WatchDog team the
chance to once again promote fire
alarms and how cheap and easy to
install they are.
Merry Euro-Christmas
Barmy bureaucrats are trying to
enforce a Euro-Christmas tree onto
us. The rules, only advisory at the
moment, state that all Euro-
Christmas trees should be: the same
colour, symmetrical and have
regularly spaced needles! What
next? More rules perhaps to ensure
a complete Euro-Christmas and
Euro-New Year. Here's an example
of what to expect:
All Euro-carol singers should wear
gloves and woolly hats and have
N O professional training
whatsoever.
All Euro-chocolate logs should be
the same colour, size and shape.
A l l Euro-decorations should
comprise of twelve stars uniquely
arranged in a circle (no one's ever
thought of that before!)
All Santa Claus' should be the same
(possibly Jacque Delors with a fake
beard after gorging himself on
Euro-cakes).
All Euro-mince pies should
consist of Euro-mince, wrapped in
Euro-pastry and cooked in a Euro-
cooker at a specified temperature
agreed by the Euro-Parliament
(probably after some considerable
length).
It's Back
Last Tuesday saw the release of the
sequel to Sonic The 'blue-haired
thing that looks nothing at all like
a hedgehog' HedgeHog, with
advance sales of 750,000. With
sales of the original Sonic grossing
£130 million, the sequel looks set
to earn even more since it is
allegedly better. But I am still
puzzled how such a crap game as
this, with its badly composed
background music, poor sound
effects, graphics that border on vile
and such appalling animation of the
characters, so much so that it makes
the cast of Eldorado look positively
life-like, has been such a success.
Nintendos rival, Super Mario,
does not offer much more than
Sonic except that the main star is
remotely more realistic in
appearance and he is supposed to
have some sort of Italian connection
(maybe he is an ex-member of the
Mafia or used to work in a factory
that made Ragu before he was
sacked for shooting fireball-type-
objects at the machines instead of
using them properly). But despite
your preference, some experts warn
that both games are liable to rot
your brains. So does Eldorado but
that's still allowed to be shown on
prime time television.
