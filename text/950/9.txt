It's all over bar the shouting, Eire has decided. While the world waits,
Declan Curry describes what lies behind Wednesday's historic
referenda.
How would you like your foetus,
Sir? Travelled, informed or
aborted?
Later this morning, the final votes
will be counted in Ireland's 27th
General Election. The votes will
also have been counted in Ireland's
trinity of abortion referenda.
Today, Ireland is expected to have
new policies on abortion.
The last Irish Constitutional
referendum on abortion was in
1983, after years of intrigue and
chicanery by conservative anti-
abortionists. By a sizeable majority,
the State was instructed to
'acknowledge the right of the
unborn with due regard to the equal
right to life of the mother', and to
'guarantee to respect and defend
It was in 1983
after years of
intrigue and
chicanery by
conservative
anti-abortionists
and vindicate that right'. The
amendment effectively banned
abortions, information on abortions,
and counselling about abortions.
Books, newspapers and magazines
were censored or seized. Pregnancy
and family planning advice centres
were closed. Medical treatment was
refused to pregnant women
suffering from cancers, leukaemias,
lymphomas, severe heart diseases,
or other pregnancy complications.
Travelling for abortions or abortion
information was also banned, but
rarely enforced.
On the one occasion when the
travel ban was enforced, the anti-
abortion case unravelled. In
February of this year, a 14 year old
rape victim, Miss X , was refused
permission to travel to England for
an abortion. X and her family were
ordered home like criminals to
Ireland by the Irish High Court. On
appeal to the Irish Supreme Court,
the travel ban was upheld, but X
was told that she could have an
abortion in Ireland, as her attempts
at suicide were judged to threaten
her and the foetus's lives, whereas
an abortion would only threaten the
life of the unborn child. Limited
abortion was now legal in Ireland,
and the campaign to ban it in all
circumstances began.
After much ado, the Government
promised not one, but three
constitutional referenda. These
dealt separately with the right to
travel, the right to information, and
the right to limited abortion. The
proposed travel amendment
promised not to limit 'the freedom
to travel between the State and
another state', a proposal branded
by militant anti-abortionists Youth
Defence as 'sending Irish children
to be murdered in England', adding
that 'the right of any citizen to travel
abroad is not the issue here'. The
right to information 'relating to
services lawfully available in other
countries' is described by these
virtuous young souls as 'agents for
abortion clinics touting in Ireland
for customers'.
And as for abortion when
'necessary to save the life of the
mother when there is an illness
giving rise to a real risk to her life'?
'There are no circumstances where
the life of the mother can be saved
by direct termination. Abortion is
medieval medicine,' said Sean
O'Donell, Medical Research
Officer for Youth Defence.
At least 15 different pressure
groups were ranged on either side
of the debate, with Ireland's five
main political parties adding to the
clutter. The campaign itself has
been vicious. The Irish Post Office
warned anti-abortion campaigners
that they may face prosecution if
they continued to send explicit
literature, containing pictures of
aborted foetuses, through the post.
Youth Defence attempted to
justify their policies, one of which
was the 'picketing' of MPs' homes.
The constitutional amendment says
'Youth Defence do not accept that
a group of people arriving at a
politician's house at 10pm could be
construed as acting in an
intimidatory fashion. 'We intend
placing pickets on the homes of
other politicians,' said Padraig
Purcell, a spokesman. This
explanation was not exactly greeted
with joy by Nuala Fennell, a Dublin
woman M P who lives alone. ' A
crowd of 15-18 people arrived at
my door,' she said. 'They were
crowded onto the doorstep and there
was a movement from the back

Children to be
murdered in
Britain
towards me. There were flashes of
light as if they were taking
photographs and the group stayed
outside for about 20 minutes. I felt
very threatened and intimidated,'
she continued.
what?
In the final week of the abortion
and election campaigns, a candidate
for the rural Galway West seat
claimed she had received death
threats. Darina Costelloe, an
Independent candidate backed by
the Pro-Life group, received the
first of the threatening calls in the
middle of last Sunday night. 'A well
spoken man, in slow, measured,
rehearsed tones, told me to
withdraw from the campaign, or my
life would be in danger', she said.
Irish police are still investigating the
incident.
Yesterday was tense as the final
votes were counted, with the result
not declared as Felix went to press.
If the last opinion polls were
correct, the amendments
guaranteeing rights of travel and
information were passed, while the
amendment to allow limited
abortion when the life of the mother
is at risk, was narrowly defeated.
The last government promised more
liberal legislation if this amendment
was defeated. It remains to be seen
if the new government will honour
that pledge. 'All is changed,
changed utterly. A terrible beauty
is born.'
