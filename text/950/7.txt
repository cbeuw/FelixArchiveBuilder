Low Level, Elastically Retarded Freefall
OK, I admit it, I am totally insane
and stark raving mad - a point
which I proved this weekend by
jumping off a 197ft crane with
nothing more than a bit of elastic
between me and near certain death.
What's more, thirty three other
people showed that they were just
as mad by doing exactly the same
thing. Those who weren't doing it
for the first time should have known
better.
The fact is, bungee jumping
scares the hell out of you for about
two to three seconds. You fall with
absolutely nothing holding you
back. The ground rotates about you
and you plunge head first, straight
down. This is followed by utter
relief as the cord pulling at your feet
rapidly slows you down. You stop
about twenty five feet from the
again. You gradually become
weightless as the cord slackens, and
the whole thing starts again.
The adrenalin rush is better than
anything else I have ever
experienced. Being scared of
heights, just being taken up to the
top of a 197 foot crane on a 2 foot
wide platform would normally be
enough to give me heart failure, but
then being told to jump off is
something completely different. As
you fall and see the platform
disappear, the ground rushes
towards you and feel the air rip past
you. You suddenly grasp all sense
of reality and think 'Why I have I
just done that? I'm going to die'.
Jumping really makes you
appreciate what life is about.
Finally, I would like to thank all
those people who jumped.
to Marcus who jumped in his
wheelchair (this is only the second
time in Britain that this has ever
happened) and in my books he
should be given a medal.
UNICEF & Simon Callow for
getting us a huge discount on
jumping.
Bungy Jump International for being
there and for having such a good
jump site.
STOIC for the video.
Alex for taking photos.
And finally anyone else who came
along and stood in the rain all day
to watch us lunatics.
Please could people get there
sponsorship money in as soon as
possible, and anyone who wants
photos of the day should come to
the R A G meeting on Friday.

Great Sightseeing Challenge
^•••njBJKlMr^^ - H I -It lrir*"h
The Great Sightseeing Challenge is
the next big R A G event of term and
it's this weekend. In a style similar
to Monopoly, you need to get
yourself in teams of about four to
six, not forgetting fancy dress if you
want to do even better. You will be
set a course around some of
London's most famous sights and
the aim is to get round the course
as quickly as possible. However
there is a catch. At each sight you
will have to take a challenge before
you are told the next sight on your
route. You get to choose between
a quick question, a physical
challenge, or an instant scavenge.
These in the past have ranged from
leapfrogging across Tower Bridge,
finding the nearest pub and tap
dancing in Parliament Square to
finding a pint of Thames water
without a pint glass and being a
town crier in the middle of Camden
Lock! Failure to do the required
challenge results in penalties being
incurred. However bonus points are
available for stylish attempts and,
as is often the case, the marshals
will be highly corruptible when
offered certain liquid bribes!
Each team will have a different
route to follow so cheating (as if
you would!) will be rather difficult.
A crafty points system has been
devised so that penalties, bonuses
and money collected will all come
together to give your team a grand
total for the day. The teams getting
to the most sights with the highest
number of points will be suitably
rewarded with the usual super
prizes you have come to expect
from R A G . There will also be
prizes for the day's highest
collectors so don't forget that R A G
is about charity! We are collecting
for Shelter so get thinking about
begging lines to make those
potential donators feel sorry for the
homeless at Christmas and hand
over their dosh.
For anyone worried about the one
day tube strike, fear not. We will
provide everyone with detailed bus
maps and marshals will have
directions to all the sites. A bonus
of the tube strike is that you can in
fact collect on buses if you ask the
conductor nicely and he says 'yes'.
This will make the course a little
longer though so you'll have to get
those challenges done even quicker!
Last year this was declared to
have been the most fun and exciting
event of the term by everyone who
took part, so, if you have enjoyed
R A G so far, this is not to be missed.
Turn up to the R A G meeting at
1.10pm today in the Ents Lounge
if you want to know more.
