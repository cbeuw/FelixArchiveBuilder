Eye Attack
Dear Jonty,
Reading the first few pages of
Felix has been part of my Friday
morning ritual for a while now.
The news is interesting and the
letters along with the editorial tend
to be rather amusing. I have
however become disenchanted with
the new column: Cat's Eyes.
On the 6th of November it was
pretty good. The following week it
had become irrelevant. Last week,
P J Dodd really lost it. What I read
was half a page of cynical self-
gratification on the part of the
author. I got the feeling that he was
looking for topics with which to fill
Statement
Dear Jonty,
As you know, Overseas Week
'92 took place last week. There
were some excellent stalls and it is
evident that these societies have put
great effort into the event. The
response from overseas societies
was extremely encouraging with 19
out of 25 societies taking part. Can
we get a one hundred per cent
response next year?
I would like to thank all those
who participated in Overseas Week
'92, especially Harpreet Singh
Chohan and Janakan Nadarajah

his page; perhaps a little
hypocritical in the light of his
remarks on tacky space fillers.
His musings are already full of
unnecessary crude language,
personal attacks that border on
cliche and narrow minded political
views that only serve to lower the
high standard that I have come to
expect of Felix.
I hope Mr Dodd takes this light
criticism as it is intended and not as
material for his increasingly
disappointing column.
Yours,

who were directly responsible for
its organisation. It is at such events
that the rest of College, especially
U K students, can discover the
culture and background of the
overseas students at Imperial
College.
Unfortunately, there was a
disturbance which forced the
premature closure of the event on
the second day. This has been given
ample publicity in last week's Felix
so I shan't say any more, except that
the people who caused the raucous
Cult Watch
Dear Jonty,
It has come to the attention of the
Christian Union in college that there
is presently a very high level of
activity amongst cult groups at IC
(and U C L , see London Student
magazine). Of particular concern to
us is the 'work' of the Central
London Church of Christ (CLCC)
on campus. This group is a
recognised cult and is banned at IC,
due to their aggressive targetting of
students and problems with people
who have wished to leave the group
in the past.
It has been their practice to
approach people in the JCR and on
walkways and hassle them to come
to one of their bible studies
(Tuesdays and Fridays). The
Christian Union has had experience
with C L C C in previous years and
we would strongly advise people
against getting involved with them.
Don't go to their bible studies, and
especially don't give them your
do not represent overseas students.
My apologies to those whose hard
work was destroyed.
Unlike last year, food was
prohibited in accordance with
College policy. Most stalls
complied with this ruling. It is a
address or phone number. If you
do, expect continuous pestering to
go to their meetings. C L C C are a
highly structured organisation, and
once you are a member they will try
to control your life to a great extent.
Large commitments of both time
and money are expected, as is
conformity with the leadership's
ideas.
We would also like to point out
that the Christian Union
departmental bible studies are on
Thursday lunchtimes and we don't
invite complete strangers to our
meetings (although everybody is
welcome). Finally if anybody has
had problems with the C L C C and
would like to talk about it, we
would be happy to help. There is
a Christian Union pigeonhole in the
Union Office, or contact me
through the aeronautical
department.

great shame that food was
prohibited, since food has always
been popular and moreover it is an
excellent way to express one's
culture.
Yours sincerely,
Yen Yang Lim.
