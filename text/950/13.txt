You may have heard of AudioSoc
before but never known what we
do—so to begin with I'll enlighten
you.
AudioSoc is Imperial College's
Hifi and Music appreciation
society. We are here to broaden the
minds of fellow students and
demonstrate how good recorded
music can really sound when played
through a 'serious' hifi system.
AudioSoc has its own hifi
equipment, one system worth
around £900, and another worth
£ 2 , 0 0 0 + . In addition to
demonstrating our own equipment
(and hiring it out to members) we
also organise evenings with two of
London's best hifi dealers—The
Cornflake Shop and The Listening
Rooms.
Other servies include discounted
LP/cassette/CD software through a
distributor, 5% special discount for
members at The Cornflake Shop
and blank tapes at low prices.
Once a term the society organises
a day trip to a hifi manufacturer so
that members get a chance to see
how the equipment is designed and
manufactured—previous visits have
included Michell, Meridian, Quad,
Arcam, Nairn, Roksan, Pink
Triangle and Monitor Audio.
A few weeks ago a minibus full
of keen AudioSoc members took a
Wednesday off to go on a visit to
Rega Research in Southend. Rega
have been manufacturing turntables
for many years and have recently
branched out into amplifiers and
loudspeakers.
We arrived at Rega about 10am
and after some refreshments were
shown around the Rega
headquarters by the M D , Roy
Gandhi. A l l the assembly
techniques (turntables, cartridges
and tonearms) were very well
explained and there was even the
opportunity for members of
AudioSoc to have a go!
After a buffet lunch we were
taken to Rega's suppliers of PCBs
and then on to Rega's second
factory where their amplifiers and
loudspeakers are assembled and
tested. The visit was rounded off,
to our surprise, with an invite back
to Roy's house for dinner and a
chance to liten to his hifi and discuss
the design methods.
It was one of the best visits we've
ever had to a manufacturer and as
an added bonus Roy donated both
the Rega Elys cartridge and a pair
of Rega Ela speakers (£80 and £405
respectively) to the club.
The next visit lined up is an
evening with The Listening Rooms
nearer to Xmas. In addition, the
club is on the point of purchasing
a new turntables—the Romsan
Xerxes—worth £1200. We are
subsequently planning a special
AudioSoc demonstration evening
where we will play off the Xerxes
against the society's Meridian 206
C D player (£1000). Which will be
better, vinyl or CD?
If you're interested in joining
come along Tuesday lunchtimes to
Southside Upper Lounge or contact

ICSF - Dick Tracy
This Tuesday, ICSF is proud to
present Dick Tracy. Warren Beatty
stars in this action extravaganza
alongside Dustin Hoffman (Rain
Man), James Caan (Misery), A l
Pacino (The Godfather trilogy) and
Madonna (who manages to keep
certain items of clothing on for the
bulk of the film).
The action centres around the
battle between cop Tracy (Beatty)
and crime kingpin 'Big Boy'
Caprice (Pacino) in a nameless '30s
American city. Things get more
complicated however, after the
intervention of a mysterious,
faceless villain called 'The Blank'
The film is shot primarily in
seven colours for a comic book feel
and features a stunning cast that also
includes Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas),
Mandy Patinkin (Alien Nation) and
Dick Van Dyke (anyone remember
Mary PoppinsT), many of whom are
under extraodinary make-up.
Come and see if you can
recognise them all at 6.45pm (for
7 o'clock) in Mech Eng 220 this
Tuesday. Members get in for £ 1 ;
membership costs £ 3 , which
includes first film entry free.

Generous to a fault, this week
FilmSoc gives you two Disney
classics for the price of one; Little
Mermaid and Sleeping Beauty.
Somewhere under the sea,
beyond your imagination, lies an
adventure in fantasy! When a
headstrong mermaid named Ariel
falls in love with a dashing and bold
human prince, she longs to be part
of the magical and dazzling world
on land. With the help of her
friends, shy, lovable Flounder and
Sebastian, a reggae-singing crab,
Ariel bravely ventures from her
underwater home to try and win her
prince's love in a thrilling race
against time. Stunning animation,
Oscar-winning songs, and
unforgettable new characters make
this Disney masterpiece a treasure
to be enjoyed now, and for
generations to come.
Sleeping Beauty is set in a
magical kingdom, and tells the story
of a king and queen who long for
a child. At last, the queen gives
birth to a daughter, and great
celebrations are held. Seven fairies
were invited to give gifts, however
they forgot an old and wicked fairy,
who was so angry that she made a
prophecy that on the child's
sixteenth birthday the princess
should die by pricking her finger on
the spindle of a spinning wheel. A
young fairy was unable to undo the
wicked spell, but instead of dying,
the princess would fall asleep for
one hundred years, until a young
prince comes and awakens her. This
charming and mystical classic is
truly wonderful entertainment for
both young and old.
So, to get in the mood for
Christmas come along to Mech Eng
220 on Thursday 3rd December.
Little Mermaid and Sleeping Beauty
start at 7pm and 8.30pm
respectively, and the standard
admission charges cover both films.
Entry is 90p for members and
children, £ 1 . 9 0 for non-members
and £6.50 to become a member,
with your first film free. Box Office
opens at 6.45pm, and we look
forward to seeing you all there.
