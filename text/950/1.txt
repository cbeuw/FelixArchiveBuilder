Greenwich 'Ultra
Vires' Shock
Jump for Rag
by the News Editor
Greenwich University Students'
Union has been banned by the High
Court from campaigning against the
Israeli government. An injunction
was brought against the union's
sabbaticals by John Meyer, a
Conservative Student activist at
Greenwich. The union's President
and Vice President were ordered to
pay individual costs of almost £500
each.
The case was heard before Mr
Justice Vinelott, who banned the
union from acting on a motion
passed on 5 November. The motion
mandated the union to campaign
against the actions of the Israeli
government in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. It also called on the
union to affiliate to the Friends of
Bir Zeit University, and to the
General Union of Palestinian
Students.
The ban was granted under the
ultra vires rules, which forbid a
union from engaging in activities
which involve political
campaigning, or which involve a
union in spending money without
any clear educational benefit. The
rules were first drafted by the
Attorney General's office in 1984,
in the aftermath of some limited
student support for the Miner's
Strike. A potential breach of the
ultra vires rules by Hull University
Students' Union is now being
investigated by the Treasury
Solicitor.
Conservative Students were
granted a preliminary junction
against the union on 16 November.
This banned the union from
campaigning against the actions of
the Israeli government, and from
sending letters to the Israeli
Embassy and the Israeli Ministry of
Defence. At the second hearing on
23 November, both Greenwich
Union's President, Paul Thomas,
and Vice President, Kevin Small,
conceded that they could not defend
their plans.
This is the first time that a
permanent injunction has been
granted against the campaigns of a
students' union. Richard Harwood,
Bar student and former
Conservative Student national
officer, said after the 23 November
hearing, 'all student unions should
now stop any campaigning on
Palestine'. John Meyer, the
Conservative Student activist who
brought the case said, 'the Union
was blatantly breaking the law. It
is about time the Union spent
money on students rather than on
political campaigning'. Both Mr.
Thomas and M r . Small were
unavailable for comment yesterday
afternoon.
The decision was welcomed by
James Pawsey, Chairman of the
Conservative Backbench Education
Committee. M r Pawsey said, 'this
clearly shows that student unions
should spend their time on
representing their members instead
of dabbling in political affairs'.
John Patten, the Education
Secretary added, 'it is only a few
students who get involved in
supporting dubious causes of no
interest to other students. Why
should the taxpayer have to pay for
it?'

Three incidents on the night of
Friday 20th November in the Union
Building have led to disciplinary
hearings being called for the
students concerned.
On two separate occasions a total
of four students were caught trying
to enter the Union Building illegally
through an open window. The
students were apprehended by
Union Stewards who obtained
identification from three of them,
the fourth could not produce a
Union Card.
Rick Bilby, the Union's Deputy
President gave Felix a statement
yesterday about a further incident:
'Later on, two different students
were physically and verbally
abusive to members of Union staff,
particularly a certain female
Steward who was alone at the time,
and very shaken by the incident.'
He went on to say that the second
incident was mainly due to
drunkenness rather than malice, and
is being regarded as less serious
than the former. However, all
students involved face disciplinary
action this week.
