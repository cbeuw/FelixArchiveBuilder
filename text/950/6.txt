27 November 1992 Felix 950
D o m ' s Disco Didactic
There must be somebody
somewhere reading Felix this week
that was enticed to Imperial by the
honey dripping words of the
undergrad prospectus, a publication
which manages to be both scantily
clad yet revealing nothing.
Supposedly, this was why our
Alternative prospectus exists, to
give the student's view of life at
college, in theory at least, because
in reality we haven't got one, yet.
The old ones though are worth a
mention if only for the timeless
comments such as people
complain about the IC social life.
Why? The scarity of women makes
it almost impossible to run regular
disco's. In any disco's that do take
place, the dance floor is surrounded
by rows and rows of men just
looking...'. Guess the year and win
a special prize!
This weeks events include
Atmosphere tonight in the Union
building, and its only £1 in, footy
on Monday in Da Vinci's, free Juke
Box and Jazz on Tuesday, Club
Libido in the Ents lounge, which is
free, free, free, bar quiz with Steve
on Thursday, win a bottle of Vody
and its only a quid in.
If you've seen one of the new
flyers for the smile zone happy
hours, use it! If you haven't they
run Monday and Wednesday
5.30-8.00pm and Friday
8.30-10.00pm
Kick-off the sling backs, enjoy,
and make mine a gin and tonic.

Free Records
Most of you are probably unaware
that there is a student elected by the
Union to buy records for the
Haldane Library. So was I until I
got mysteriously elected to the post.
This is probably because last year's
buyer (who shall remain nameless)
didn't actually buy anything (he was
too busy being a sabbatical (then
aged 30) at the time, obviously).
What I have to do is go out and
spend large sums of the union's
money on buying 'popular music'
(ie. anything except classical stuff,
which I don't have to buy) for the
library, which you lot presumably
go and borrow and listen to (but no
illegal taping, of course).
For some strange reason, I'm not
allowed to buy just what I want, but
have to get a 'representative
selection' of rock, pop and all that
toss. This means that if you fill in

Careers Info

City' by M r Alan King of

December: 'Opportunities for
Physicists' by Dr Andrew Wallard

Laboratory—in LT1 Physics Dept.
a request form in the Haldane, I
might just get the record. Try^and
check that they don't already have
it, though (you can use the
computers in the library to do that).
If it does you street cred harm to be
seen in the library too often, you
can drop a request into my
undergrad pigeonhole, if you really
want to. Be warned - any requests
for Kylie, Take That etc. will be
ignored, unless you can convince
me that it is actually worth spending
money on this stuff. At the moment,
I'm only allowed to buy vinyl or
cassette, but next term I should be
buying CD's (if that's the sort of
thing that turns you on). Sometime
soon, I'll be getting in all the stuff
that didn't get bought last year, so
there y' go.
Dave Goddard, Physics III (!)
