Profit From Poverty
ICU Third World First tell the story behind the Third World debt to the
national banks, and suggests ways that you can protest.
FACT: 500,000 children die each year as a
result of Third World debt (Unicef, 1990)
FACT: For every £1 the U K Government
gives to the Third World, British banks
extract £4 of debt repayments (WDM, 1991)
FACT: Rain forests are torn down to pay
the debt. Estimates say that they will
virtually disappear in under 30 years (FoE,
1991) '
Once upon a time, we were rolling
in oil money (that's economics for
you). We wanted more profits.
Being a listening bank, we
persuaded out friend Mr Dick Tatar
(of Thirdworldland) to take out a
massive loan to develop his
country. Pretty safe bet — even if
he did a runner, his people couldn't.
We started raking in the money.
Dark horses aren't we?
But then ... whoops ... up went
oil prices and interest rates and
down went prices of Third World
goods (economics, it's a scream,
eh?). M r Dick Tatar fled. The
people of Thirdworldland started
whinging that paying all this interest
was devastating their livelihoods.
This was worrying. What if our
profits fell?
So in stepped our other friends at
the International Monetary Fund,
with one of their winning plans:
throw Third World people off their
farms and make way for huge
plantations growing cocoa for
western choc bars! Thankfully,
despite a bit of death disease and
environmental destruction, it's OK,
they're earning the cash to keep
paying us back.
Some people say that just because
we could afford to cancel the debt,
we should. But then some people
just don't understand economics.
We and our shareholders are
laughing all the way to the bank!
Do you think this story is funny?
Did you know that your high street
bank could tell a similar tale?
If you are concerned, you can
join Third World First on
Wednesday 2nd December.
Students are staging nationwide
protests against the injustice of debt
repayments. Imperial College
students will be part of a symbolic
funeral march in London. Meet us
either outside Southside Upper
Lounge at 1.15pm or outside U L U
on Malet Street at 2.00pm. Please
come dressed in black.
Alternatively, Third World First
suggest that you can let the banks
know yourself by writing to your
bank manager, or considering
cutting up your credit cards or
consider transferring your account
to another bank (eg Bank of
Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland,
TSB or Coop) or to a building
society.
