Mother Earth —Hope You're
Feeling Fine
A nice funky one this. The sort of
thing that makes it worth listening
to all those crap toons. On the flip
are two more toons. 'Little Bag
O'Sugar' is a little jazzy number,
and 'Jonathan E ' , well groovy.
The lyrics may be from the
'meaningless' school but who cares.
I get enough people telling me what
to think as it is. Get out there and
enjoy yourself, while you still have
the chance.

J —Born on the Wrong Side
of Town
When I dropped into the Felix
office the other day, asking for
reviews, this one, seemed
interesting enough to me.
Well, it turned out to be rap, and
unfortunately I'm not very much
into rap, but there's a couple of
things I do know about it. Rap, I
have learnt, is or at least was once
the music of black American people
relating very much to their own
political and social situation.
Now they have it in Berlin, too.
Yes, 'Born on the Wrong Side of
Town' is, as you may have guessed,
the story of East Berlin ghetto
people having seen the coming
down of the Wall, being betrayed
and exploited by the Westerners,
being even worse off now than they
used to be and being tempted to
wish back the Wall again.
This is a thing from Germany for
Germans to understand and identify
with, and it may not be the last thing
necessary to say about their specific
situation. Why then, forHonecker's
sake, does this / bloke sing, or rap,
in English? Or alternatively, why
does he deplore the consequences
of a historic development that he
has to thank his own musical
enlightenment to? Two other tracks
on this C D are anti-Nazi statements,
maybe a slightly more international
problem these days.
The answer to all this is
obviously, I'm afraid, that / and all
his English and American co-
writers, producers and mixers strive
for success on international
dancefloors rather than for
influence on the political situation
they relate to.

Nirvana —In Bloom
Yet another single release from
'Nevermind'—like, do they really
need to promote it any more?
Makes no difference to me, of
course—I bought the album ages
ago. This single does, however,
confirm just how good Nirvana
really are.
A lot of people actually resent
them for their success, saying that
they've sold their souls to corporate
rock, but what's wrong with selling
eight million records? Surely if a
band as clued up and ultra-cool as
Nirvana breaks through to the big
time without compromising that all-
important 'artistic integrity', it is a
good thing.
Anyway...
While probably not the best song
on the album, 'In Bloom' still beats
the crap out of many records I've
heard on the radio recently. The
flipside is a live version of 'Polly'
(off the album, too) and it ain't bad,
either.
Erm...'nuff said, I think. (Oh
yeah, one more thing—watch out
for the Nirvana/Jesus Lizard double
A-side single coming out sometime
soon.)

Albums
Neil Young —Harvest Moon
There's a new feeling on the breeze.
The high priests of yesteryear glaze
backwards...we spy our roots, the
things that made us great. Bob
Dylan has returned acoustic 27
years after he went electric; Neil
Young has revisited his 1972
triumph 'Harvest'. Maybe it's the
sense of their approaching O A P
status that's causing the
retrospection? Who cares, I'm not
complaining. Still Neil Young has
already had his second adolescence,
exploding with 'Ragged Glory',
'Weld' and as acting grandad to
skinny kids with feedback on their
minds. So why not have a second
mellowing as well?
'Harvest Moon' displays a
nostalgic mood, tripped out in the
style of someone who's seen it all,
and more, before. Now he can just
sit on his porch, pipe in hand, dog
asleep at his feet. Not surprisingly,
the content is as meandering as the
archetypal mid-west stream, with
enough false bands to infuriate but
IP
Strictly Ballroom: 'He Blinked!!'
just enough recurrent to take you
along for a ride. Characteristic of
this is the problem of Young's vocal
chords. Again like Dylan, they have
been his deliverer and executioner
combined, depending on your point
of view. 'You and Me' displays a
falsetto voice delicately played
against guitar and backing singer
yet, it's overstrained in the dotting
'Such a Woman' and stagnant in
'Harvest Moon', the title track,
which makes for a disappointing
opening series of tracks. So quickly
onwards...
Happily on 'One of these Days'
and 'Old King' it's back to the gruff
whisky soaked tones. 'Old King' is
the highlight. Neil's dog has died
(...that old hound dog is history).
Not that he's too bothered. Lucky
really as a clanking hoedown
results. Still on 'Dreamin' Man',
the complexities of even wistful
memories are recovered; sweet
dreams of you are a loaded gun
don't make happy bed mates.
They say a full moon makes you
mad: With eyes like his, let's hope
he keeps dreaming, but not in my
backyard please.
Tintin.
Strictly Ballroom—O.S.T.
Oh. A m I going to have a field day
on this one? Yes, I am. Just look
at this track listing: 'Love is in the
A i r ' — John Paul Young. A
classic—once. Here it sounds like
Undercover. (Don't, I beg you, take
that as a compliment); 'Time After
Time'—Mark Williams and Tara
Morice. The Cyndi Lauper ballad
reduced to an incredibly annoying
duet. 'The Blue Danube'. Oh, God.
No. No. No. The Bogo Pogo
Orchestra—I kid you not. Mummy.
Makes Strauss seem like Seuss. At
least the funky drummer has left this
alone. These are the best tracks,
believe me.

A Very Special Christmas 2
—Various Artists
Various Artists? Various wankers,
morelike. Check this list of assorted
artists out: Luther Vandross; Boyz
II Men; Randy Travis; Extreme;
Wilson Phillips; Sinead O'Connor.
Look, it's for charity. I'm not going
to go into explicit graphic detail of
the true banality of this album, and
even in the season of good will to
all men, I draw the line at being
pleasant to anything featuring
Michael Bolton. He should have
several seasonal evergreens shoved
up- where even the most fearless
tinsel daren't go.
