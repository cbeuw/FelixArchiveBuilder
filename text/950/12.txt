Jimi Hendrix - The Voodoo Chile
Rachel Mountford skins up and takes a trip down memory lane to theplace
where castles made of sand crumble into the sea...
Fifty years ago today a man was
born who would revolutionise the
playing of the electric guitar and
change the face of rock music
forever. Twenty seven years later
he was dead - a victim of the rock
and roll circus. That man was James
Marshall Hendrix better known as
Jimi.
Voodoo Chile
Labelled the Wild Man Of Pop
and the Wild man of Borneo, Jimi
Hendrix broke onto the London
music scene in September 1966.
Having been brought over from the
States by ex-Animals bassist Chas
Chandler, he was quickly adopted
by the British music press and
public. With his wild hair,
outlandish clothes and sensational
guitar playing, word soon spread
about this black American who was
blowing audiences away in clubs all
over London. Before the end of the
year the Jimi Hendrix Experience,
featuring Noel Redding on bass and
Mitch Mitchell on drums, released
their first single, 'Hey Joe', which
reached number six in the charts.
An English tour was lined up for
1967 with gigs up and down the
country, including two shows at the
Saville Theatre in London
supported by The Who, at the time
one of the biggest names on the
English pop scene, and gigs in
Belgium and France. In between
gigs they managed to find time to
record 'Purple Haze', their second
single which went to number three.
By the end of the tour in April 1967
they were stars. The Jimi Hendrix
Experience continued to tour in
Europe whilst recording their first
album, aptly entitled 'Are You
Experienced' which was released in
May. However, big as they were
over here, they were still practically
unheard of in Jimi's homeland.
Thus it was that after a final gig at
the Saville in London, Jimi and The
Experience were flying out to
America.
House Burning Down
The first International Monterey
Pop Festival was to mark the
dawning of The Age Of Aquarius,
and featured acts such as The
Grateful Dead, The Who and 77ie
Mamas And Papas. It was here that
the Jimi Hendrix Experience was to
make its American debut on the
final day of the festival. No-one
knew who they were and Hendrix
was understandably nervous.
Before the gig, an argument erupted
between The Who and Hendrix.
Neither band was prepared to
follow the other. In the end, a coin
was tossed and Hendrix lost. He
leaned over and said quietly to Pete
Townsend 'If we're going to follow
you, I'm going to pull out all the
stops.'
After The Who had finished their
set it looked like Hendrix was going
to have a hard task. The crowd were
crazed and it was decided that The
Grateful Dead should play first to
calm the crowd. A lull before the
storm.
The Jimi Hendrix Experience
took the stage and crashed straight
into a blasting version of 'Killing
Floor' followed immediately by
'Foxey Lady'. They had arrived
and everybody knew it. They
slowed it down with a Bob Dylan
cover, 'Like A Rolling Stone', and
from there built it up to the grand
finale.

'You know, everybody says that,
man, it is no big story about we
couldn't make it here so we go over
to England and America doesn't
like it because, you know, our feets
too big and we've got fat mattresses
and we wear golden underwear. It
ain't no scene like that, brother, you
know, it's just laying around and
went to England and picked up
these two cats and now we're here.
Man it's so groovy to come back
here this way and really get a
chance to really play, you know.. .1
can sit here all night and say
thankyou, thankyou, thankyou, but
I could just as well grab you man
and ohhh...but I just can't do that
man so I'm gonna sacrifice
something here that I really love
okay. Don't think I'm silly doing
this 'cos I don't think I'm losing my
mind. This is for everybody, this is
the only way I can do it. So we're
gonna play the American and
English anthem combined. Don't
get mad. There's nothing more I
can do.'
They revved it up as far as it
would go and then plunged into the
most famous and amazing version
of 'Wild Thing' ever witnessed.
The whole routine, feedback
screeching, playing the guitar
between his legs, behind his head,
on his knees finally, the ultimate
sacrifice, igniting his guitar and
then smashing it, still burning, to
bits before flinging it to the crowd.
They left the stage in triumph.
Hendrix had come home.
If My Daddy Could See Me Now
They had become international
superstars overnight, but as is so
often the case there was a long story
behind Hendrix's success. He had
been working for this since having
been invalided out of the army as
a paratrooper five years previously.
He spent these five years working
from gig to gig, backing musicians
such as Little Richard, Sam Cooke
and The Isley Brothers. However
Hendrix inevitably got bored of
being a backing man and longed for
the limelight. Little Richard recalled
how Jimi continually tried to
upstage him.
He frequently had so little money
that he couldn't afford to buy new
strings to play gigs. Black guitarists
were supposed to play blues, and
blues guitarists, even good ones
were ten a penny. No-one seemed
interested in a black man playing
the most amazing rock guitar. Until
Linda Keith, Keith Richard's
girlfriend, sent Chas Chandler
along to check him out Jimi was just
another guitarist wondering where
the next gig was coming from. Chas
was looking for an act to take back
to England to manage and Jimi was
that act.

When they got to England a band
was needed. Noel Redding turned
up to what he thought was an
audition for guitarist in The New
Animals only to find the position
already filled. When Chas asked if
he could play bass and sit in with
Jimi for a jam he was so broke he
was game for anything. They hit it
off immediately and with Mitch
roped in on drums The Experience
was born.
After Monterey, the band carried
on touring and recording, releasing
two further studio albums, 'Axis -
Bold As Love', and 'Electric
Ladyland'. The latter marked a new
direction in Hendrix's musical
style. He was trying to move
towards bigger bands with many
different musicians sitting in for
long extended jams. Studio time
was increasing and Jimi was
dabbling in the production, too.
This started to have its effect on the
band. Noel was unhappy with the
number of extra musicians and
hangers on perpetually present in
the studio. Things were taking too
long and tempers were getting
frayed. In the end Noel and The
Experience went different ways.
Electric Gypsy
Noel Redding was replaced by
Jimi's old army buddy, bassist Billy
Cox and the band was extended by
Larry Lee, Juma Sultan and Jerry
Velez. In 1969 they played at the
Woodstock Music And Art Fair.
They played a superb set of jams
and extended compositions,
showing Jimi's increasing trend
towards a jazz orientated
performing style. However the
crowd, waiting for the pyrotechnics
of two years back, soon became
impatient and finally many walked
out. A sad ending for the man who
had been voted 'Performer of the
Year' by Rolling Stone magazine
only six months previously.
Wanting to make a new start Jimi
completely disbanded the
Experience and start again.
Buddy Miles was recruited on
drums and A Band Of Gypsies was
formed. Concerts moved towards
becoming nothing more than live
jam sessions. Jimi's fans still
wanted to hear 'Purple Haze' and
'Fire' but Hendrix wasn't prepared
to deliver. He was changing and he
wanted his audience to grow with
him. The final live performance of
the Band Of Gypsies was at the
Winter Festival For Peace in New
York City. Jimi left the stage after
playing only two numbers. The
Band Of Gypsies was dead.
Cry Of Love
Jimi took some time off after this,
considering where he was going
musically. In the end Mitch
Mitchell was brought back and The
Jimi Hendrix Experience was ready
to take on the World again. The
'Cry Of Love Tour' started in April
with a stunning concert at The L A
Forum in California. The stadium
was packed with expectant fans and
they were not disappointed.
'Spanish Castle Magic' and 'Foxey
Lady' opened the set followed by
a selection of new music and music
from the Band Of Gypsies, finishing
with 'The Star Spangled Banner',
'Purple Haze' and 'Voodoo Chile'
(slight return). Jimi was finally on
his way back up with the new
material being stronger than
anything he had produced in a long
time. The tour continued
throughout the spring and summer,
including a show back in his home
town of Seattle.
Stone Free
On August 27th, The Experience
flew to England for the Isle Of
Wight Festival which he was due to
headline. With the festival running
late Jimi didn't take the stage until
the early hours of Monday
morning. The whole performance
was hindered by equipment trouble
and it wasn't helped by Hendrix's
apprehension at playing back in
England again. He'd been away for
a long time. Jimi, obviously
frustrated, finally turned to the
audience. 'If you can hold on a little
bit, I think we can get it together.
Alright? Cos I'm goin' to stay here
all night until somebody moves.'
They started again with 'Freedom'
and 'Red House' and carried on
through a mix of old and new
material. It was to be Jimi's last gig
in England. On 18th September
1970 he was dead.
Many versions about the events
leading up to his death exist, but one
thing is undoubtedly true. It was an
accident, a tragic but avoidable
accident. The official cause of death
was recorded as inhalation of vomit
due to barbiturate intoxication and
an open verdict was returned. He
was twenty seven.
Bold As Love
What are we to make of this man
who was different things to different
people. The wild man of pop was
a quiet, even timid, man, charming
and a true genius. He took the
electric guitar and redefined the
parameters of rock music. His
awesome power and control of
effects from feedback to wah-wah
was balanced by compositions of
such .immeasurable beauty that it
seems inconceivable that they could
be the same man. He has been
copied by many, but that is all they
will ever be - copies. Hendrix was,
and still is, the greatest composer,
inventor and innovator of electric
guitar playing.
