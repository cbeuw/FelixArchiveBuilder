Josephine
Billed as the true story of black
artiste Josephine Baker singer,
dancer, idealist, campaigner, bon
viveur...all boded well. I returned
feeling as though I'd been cudgeled
with a blunt instrument. Her life
spanned most of the twentieth
century, this hardly excuses three
hours of: Josephine irons, changes
her clothes (big politically correct
speech), combs her hair (bigger,
correcter speech), changes her
clothes...etc etc. Baker led a
fascinating eclectic existence which
at the pedantic hands of writer
Maureen Chadwick becomes
confused, disjointed, and frankly
boring.
Repetitive, inarticulate political/
social/historical rants are
interpsersed with 'ominous' she's-
losing-her-marbles-twilight-zone-
music and a blood coloured rag or
two (??) totally contrary to the
prevailing cabaret style. The only
saving grace of this messy, under-
rehearsed amateurish evening was
Dawn Hope's Josephine which was
simply stunning. From wacky,
engaging, vulnerable child to self-
obsessed star to disillusioned old
woman her singing, dancing and
acting is beautiful. What a waste.

Travels With My Aunt
Green's typically surreal tale of
small town retired banker, Henry
Pulling, dragged away from his
dalias and around the world by his
75-year-old vamp of an aunt,
Augusta, requires a cast of 26.
Travels With My Aunt is lifted
from the grim banality of Green's
morose meander through middle-
class mundanity to hilarious heights
by a superlative display of acting.
Identically besuited, Simon Cadell,
Christopher Gee, Richard Kane and
John Wells treat us to a veritable
masterclass. Dogs, priests,
policemen, women from teen-to-a-
certain-age are rendered deliciously
comic, by a virtuoso repertoire of
voices and mannerisms. All four
gentlemen at some time play the
put-upon Henry, frequently at the
same time. Though crisply stylised
this enhances the meditative
narrative with its mental wrangles
and subconscious asides. Rakish
Aunt Augusta is painted in glorious,
Woodhousian technicolour by
Cadell. His crusty physical and
lusty vocal command of the
viciously endearing nutcase is
gripping. Don't miss this.

She Stoops to Conquer
'She' is Miss Hardcastle, daughter
of the wealthy but down to earth Mr
and Mrs Hardcastle and stoops to
conquer Marlow, her arranged
husband-to-be, by masquerading as
a barmaid? Why? Well it seems that
Marlow (or 'the hunky one' as he
was referred to by several female
audience members) has a massive
problem with expressing himself to
women who are possible brides.
Hence the barmaid disguise by Miss
Hardcastle so she can discover his
true feelings for her, since the
marriage depends on her approval.
Confused? Don't be. Once you've
seen the play, you will realise how
straightforward it is.
Set in the 18th century, She
Stoops To Conquer is amazingly
funny and the accents and
mannerisms of the cast are perfect.
Characters to watch for include the
servants, M r and Mrs Hardcastle
and Marlow.
Only one harsh criticism, the 18th
century language comprising of
'methinks' and 'perchance' got to
me occasionally, but it was
forgotten amid torrents of laughter.

St Petersburg Ballet Theatre
Boris Eifman's St Petersburg Ballet
Theatre gives an excellent
performance in a combination of
classical ballet and contemporary
dance.
Two contrasting ballets are
performed. The tragedy 'Therese
Raquin' based on Zola's novel with
music by Bach. The story is of two
lovers whose neighbours are unable
to understand their passion. Eifman
sums up the idea he wishes to
portray as 'One cannot build one's
happiness on the misfortune of
others'.
Powerful and vivid emotions are
expressed as the dancers are totally
absorbed in their characters.

Flashing nipples, giant ears, corgi
skateboards, stainless steel chastity
belts, and flying sushi-burgers.
Doesn't sound like Gilbert and
Sullivan? Ah, but this is Ken
Russell's Gilbert and Sullivan.
Ken Russell (producer of the Lair
ofthe White Worm, Altered States,
and other films) has transported the
musical to 2000AD, and set it in
London. Buckingham Palace has
become the amusement park Buck
'n' Yen Palace, and the women
have set up their college at the
Tower of London. There are other
sweeping changes: two of the male
leads are gay, and can't wait to get
into drag, King Gama (nicely
played by Nicholas Grace) has
become a sushi-seller and Japanese,
The comedy: 'Figaro's Intrigues'
based on 'The Barber of Seville'
with music by Rossini is performed
in a highly amusing and jestful way
with the exaggerated movements
working very well.
Resisting the rigid rules of
Russian Ballet, the choreographic
freedom Eifman gives himself is
quite amazing. His performers are
not only excellent dancers but very
skilled actors.
Superb dancing—brilliant
choreography.

while his sons career around the
stage on mountain bikes, and
Princess Ida herself (Rosemary
Joshua, with a truly beautiful voice)
wears a cutaway pseudo-beefeater
outfit with flashing nipples. The
libretto has also been altered, in
parts, in an attempt to live up to all
of this.
However, while I found this
amusing during the performance, I
left feeling vaguely dissatisfied. The
singing and acting are quite
reasonable, but the production as a
whole is gimmicky, tacky, and even
vulgar at points, and more like a
funny seaside postcard than a classic
musical. Yes, I enjoyed it, but I
doubt I would recommend it to
friends.
