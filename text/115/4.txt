The disclosure of the estimated
eoat of retaining the Coloutt tower
again triage forcibly to our notice
the obstacles which confront progress
In this eountry. Already many of our
scientists and engineers emigrate to
the United States and Canada whore
seientifie development i s fostered by
every conceivable means. If a con-
cession to Victorian sentimentalism
at the eost of a qquarter of a mil-
lion pounds is thought to bo realist-
ic, It i s hardly likely to encourage
fewer to do so.
PHOENIX GETS
THE BIRD
Following so soon after the re-
port prepared by i t s sub-editors, the
latest PHOENIX came as a great disap-
pointment. Rudimentary principles
which should have been taken for gran-
ted seem to have been completely dis-
pensed with. First, THE PHOENIX is
the magazine of Imperial College and
as sueh should reflect the activities
and interests of the College, Second,
i t should provide scope for original
thought. Third, articles should be
clear and concise (a soientifie prin-
ciple), interesting and readable.
At on* extreme wo have Maurice
Savidov's incomparable "Light Metal-
lurgy". This i s a beautiful example
of what I mean by reflecting the act-
ivities of the College (The Guinness
advertisement alone attained success
In this direction). The idea was or-
iginal and expounded with simplicity.
At the other extreme stands, or
rather f a l l s , the profile of Albert
Camus. There is no connection be-
tween M. Camus and Imperial College.
This article, something under a page
in length, contained no fewer than
five quotations, five pickings from
other people's brains. Readable? At
lsast i t was short.
Unfortunately IC.Camus's profile
Is by no means alone i n i t s extremity.
There i s no need for me to give a
catalogue hare.
So review of this PHOENIX could
possibly noglset "Clotty". Sething to
la with I.C.t anything but concise,
i t nevertheless contained a spark of
originality — the use of words for
purposes other than that for which
they wore originally intended is
something achieved only accidentally
by most people. PJt.l.
We were very sorry to hear of the
death of John Perkins a second year
Chemioal- Engineer. Be was a regular!
member of the 1st XT and his loss will
be keenly felt.
Any member of the College who
thinks for a moment about the offer-
ings of Touchstone and General Studies,
will realize that a not inconsiderable
amount of money is involved in keeping
up the high standard of speakers
invited.
This money is in the main
provided by the Governing Body and i s
believed to total about £2,000 per
annum. About half of this is spent
on the general studies lectures, and
the remainder on grants for various
activities around the college. We
thus have the position that less than
£1 i s spent for each member of the
student body throughout the whole year,
but far worse than this i s the fact
that non-scientific culture i s thought
to be less than the worth of one
professor, and any look at the Calen-
dar will show how many of these high
gentlemen are apparently floating
around.
S A T U R D A Y N I G H T
Last Saturday's hop was the first
one to be held under the Entertain-
ments Committee's improvement plan.
It was unfortunate that many of the
women's training colleges had not yet
restarted, as a result of which there
were about 50 more men than women
fresent. A l l the single men's
100) and double Tickets (75) were
sold, but only 50 of the 100 women's
tickets. About 50 men were turned1
away; some of the more venturesome
stood by the door and introduced
themselves to the first girl who oame
along, returning In triumph to buy a
double ticket.
There was no inspection of Union
cards, and men who oame along wearing
L.S.E- and King's scarves were not
refused tickets while they lasted.
This seems unfortunate since many I.C.
men were among those turned away
later.
There was room to dance i n oom-
fort i n the Concert Ball, for a
change, but there were few people
upstairs, where the Jass Band was
playing. With a f u l l complement of
women things might have been quite
different. Certainly one cannot Judge
the E.C.'s plan on this one hopi the
popularity of their innovations re-
mains to be seen.
HALOS FOR ROVER CREW
Eight members of I.C. Rover Crew
saw in the New Tear in rigorous fashion
in the Borrowdale region of the Lake
District. Four of them camped at
Sprinkling Tarn (2,000 ft.) on the
nights of January 1st and 2nd. It
waa very cold in camp - a tent, damp
when pitched, froze solid and two pairs
of boots were frozen overnight and H«d
to be thawed out over a Primus. On
New Tear's Day, the party climbed Jo
the top of Soafell Pike, from w

they saw the spectre of the Brooke*,
a kind of misty mirage effect that
bestows a halo on one's shadow.
Is this an equitable expenditure,
or should our facilities for broader
education be expanded? The question
of shortage of money may be raised,
but surely this cannot be a valid
argument in view of the insignificant
amount already spent as compared with
the general expenditure on teaching
staff as a whole: would i t not be of
much greater benefit to a l l concerned
i f some of the relatively useless
members of the present Academic Staff
were disposed of and the money diverted
to the furtherance of the Arts and the
Humanities? I fear that this is
another case of a dictatorial c i v i l
service deciding that a scientific
institution shall teach nothing else
but science. It i s just as necessary
for us to have a good nan-technical
library as i t i s for the wide provision
of scientific books and journals.
The union library, good though i t i s ,
is half-strangled through lack of
finance.
The Record Library supplies
a much needed service to the whole
college, and indeed seems very well-
patronised, but once again finance is
its stumbling block. Purchases of
new discs can only be made infrequently
and the smallness Of i t s grant precludes
the widening of i t s catalogue much beyond
the popular repertoire. What support do
the Art Club and the Photographic Society
get for their furthering of the Arts?
None,so far as I know. One could work
through any cultural activities of the
College and the Union, a l l along the line
one finds this same paucity of support.
What can be done? The answer is
simple, make available more money which
surely cannot be 30 difficult for our
well-financed Governing Body. Any
suggestions that these Touchstone grants
may be cut must be strangled at birth,
ar.d every possible means adopted for
the Governor'3 equitable support must
be furthered.

WALLET THIEF
GETS FIVE YEARS
At the December Sessions of the
Old Bailey, a man was sentenced to
5 years imprisonment for the theft of
a wallet from the gymnasium changing
room in the Union. He had previously
been convicted, in 1947, for stealing
from the same place, and altogether
30 oases were taken into consideration.
The thief gave himself away by
using a driving licence taken from a
wallet belonging to an R.C.S. man as
an identification when passing worth-
less chequea. He was arrested by the
Police and questioned, but would at
first only admit to passing the
cheques. Eventually, however, ho did
confess to the thefts. None of the
stolen property waa recovered.
