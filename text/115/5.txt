Deer Sir,
Whilst agreeing generally with
Xenophon's views on Exploration, I
should like to make the following
comments.
Although i t i s desirable that
expeditions be of the most general
kind, so that members with the widest
range of interest may participate,
no attempt w i l l be made by the New
Exploration Society to discourage
expeditions which are largely
specialist in nature, since these may
go to a region quite unsuited to a
general expedition. In addition
i t i s the specialist typo of expedi-
tion which yields the greatest amount
of scientific information.
The impression of the Exploration
Board which i s given is also mis-
leading, for despite their "bureau-
cratic trammellings", they have suc-
ceeded in giving the leaders of past
College Expeditions admirable support.
Tours sincerely,
Peter Smith
Dear Sir,
The viewpoint of one "Xenophon"
on Exploration contained an inaccurate
statement with regard to the financing
of the 1958 Ghana Expedition. A l -
though the Exploration Board has given
iac/\ey to the extent of one third of the
original estimated cost, the remainder
has to be made up of individual contri-
butions t*om the student members and
donations irom industrial and commercial
organisations?
Ii'ijct he argi&f JbX future ex-
peditions should be f a research
nature. By definition, expeditions
involve investigation of unknown
"territory" - whether i t be geological,
geographical, meteorological, geo-
physical, biological or any other" -
ioal" i s immaterial. Exploration
is therefore either synonymous with
research, or at least an integral part
of i t . To suggest the divorcement
of the two is meaningless.
In a badly punctuated and obscurely
worded sentence he inferred that specia-
l i s t expeditions were undesirable, and
also that their members jealously opp-
osed other groups planning expeditions.
This firstly shows his ignorance of
the problems envoived. Sponsors do
not give money out of charity. They
ask and deserve reasonable results.
As shown above, there i s a wide range
of topios to explore. With such limi-
ted numbers, only a few can be dealt
with adequately i f the reasonable re-
sults are to be obtained. Hence
specialisation is inevitable, i f only
from the financial angle. As to his
second point about opposition from
so-called "vested interest, I know of
none and would be interested to learn
precisely what he means.
He next took upon himself to
apeak for the proposed Exploration
Society, a Society which dUn»*t even
exist when he wrote the article.
Further, the Initiators of the Society
disowned the article when i t appeared.
I.C. ?
Dear Sir,
When is a society an I.C. Society?
As I understand i t , not until their
provisional constitution has been road
and passed by two successive S.C.C. or
A.C.C. meetings. On this pretext . ire-
fore the Church Society i s not entitled
to call itself an I.C. Society, as
their constitution has so far only been
read once.
They should thus bo severely
reprimanded for wrongly describing
themselves in the General Studies pro-
gramme.
Yours faithfully,
J.K.Taylor.
I cor ratulate the writer of the
article on getting a few points correct,
especially the aims of the Exploration
Society - perhaps i t was because these
latter were up on a notice board in the
Union &r the time.
Finally he complained of the "mere
bureaucratic trammellings of the
(Exploration) Board". This is my se-
cond year of dealing with the Board and
I have yet to experience these trammell-
ings". On the contrary, where an ex-
pedition has been jeopardised by delays,
they have mercilessly by-passed any red
tape to give a l l possible aid.
I believe FELIX aims at producing
controversial articles to promote
discussion among readers. It i s
however, the duty of the writers to
oheck their facts and thus avoid i n -
accurate Or half true statements.
These can only mislead readers who
are not in a position to oheck the
facts for themselves.
Tours sincerely,
Robert F. Sturrock.
Editor's note:
To quote the first paragraph of
the "Viewpoint" to which Mr. Sturrock
refers: "Several highly successful
expeditions have been run by students
from this college during the last few
years. But what of future plana? -
To judge from the Exploration Board's
in-tray only a follow-up expedition of
a research nature, which might well
have been backed from other sources,
is forthcoming." No mention at a l l
was made of the financial outlay i n -
volved.
Mr. Sturrock refers to bad
punctuation and obscure wording. We
have printed his letter in i t s original
English, apart from correcting the more
elementary mistakes, of which nine were
spelling errors and ten grammatical.
We wish he would confine himself to the
subject under discussion.
In each case the speaker of the House
will be provided by the Literary and
Debating Society.
We would like as many as possible
members of the Union to attend, either
as Independent M.P. s when they will
hnve an opportunity to speak, or as
observers.
Yours faithfully,

PUT UP JOB
Sir,
In the Prince's Gardens' column
of your issue dated December 6th, you
refer to "put-you-up type" beds as
being wholly unsuitable for your
hostel project. Your advisers suggest
that, in other hostels, such beds "were
virtually worn out" after four years of
contact with the student body.
We are relieved that you write of
"put-you-up type beds" since, as manu-
facturers of the original PUT-U-UP
settee-bed, we have many imitators.
And although we are a l i t t l e long in
the tooth to remember preoisely the
strains which student furniture must
bear, we are confident that a genuine
PDT-U-UP would stand the test of many
more years than four. Even under
Cite Universite conditions - which, wo
imagine, are unlikely ever to be dupli-
cated in the 1.0..'
Yours faithfully,
