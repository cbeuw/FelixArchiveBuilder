RUGBY
•continued Span page 1,
This match waa played on a firm
•brown-coloured pitch jji Spring-like
conditions, with a cloudless sky.
I.C., described i n the local paper as
"les vainqueurs d'Oxford et Cambridge"
felt that something was expected of
them, and provided a good display of
clean, open rugby. Dai Phillips, a
tower of strength to the backs in a l l
three games, kicked a magnificent
penalty goal, loudly acclaimed by the
1,200 crowd, and Sarlat equalised with
a much easier kick just before half-
time.
The I.C. forwards, with Gibbons,
Crosier and Gilbert much to the fore,
obtained a large share of the ball.
An injury to Brougham forced a re-
organisation of the backs, but they
threw the ball about well and Gibson
had some good runs down the left wing.
Several times I.C. oame very near to
scoring a try, but the Sarlat defence
was keen, so a draw was a fair result.
After the match Sarlat threw a
magnificent banquet. They had made
no secret of the fact that their inten-
tion was to eat and drink I.C. under
the table. Sarlat i s described i n
some guide-books as "renowned for i t s
gastronomy", and when I.C. were called
upon to drink soup-plates f u l l of red
wine in one swig, i t looked as though
extremely hardy constitutions would
be required to withstand the onslaught.
At the end many I.C. men looked groggy
and some suffered fearful repercussions
later. One was even found snatching
forty winks in a side-street. However
seven or eight were left upstanding and
willing to oontinue when the last rem-
nants of Sarlat had clearly had enough.
This gastronomioal triumph was also
notable for the f i r s t of three diplo-
matic speeches i n French by Lanz during
the exchange of presentations, and some
entertaining singing by persons of both
nationalities.

Saintes were not described on the
advertisements as "renforoe" for
nothing, as they included seven bor-
rowed players, including 4 from Cognac,
a first-class club. The local paper
had proclaimed I.C. as among *1'elite
da l a balle ovale". It was gratifying
to find that the rugby correspondent of
"La Republique" appeared to think this
t i t l e well justified, as, heading his
description of the match "L'IMPERIAL
COLLEGE A FAIT UNE BELLE EXHIBITION DE
JEU ODVERT", he praised I.C. for keep-
ing the game open despite "l'etat du
terrain qui rendait l a balle glisaanto
et le jeu a l a main parfois difficile*

After an even first half Saintes
led by a try to n i l . However, the
I.C. forwards, playing uphill, then
staged a magnificent rally, thanks in
no small measure to the sterling front
row of Martin, Gibbons and Topping.
After a complicated series of events,
Gibson scored i n the left corner, and
shortly afterwards Lain pounced on a
defensive mistake by Saintes to put
I.C. ahead. Phillips just missed
with a dropped goal and was once pulled
down a yard short of the line. The
Saintes team, now jabbering heatedly
among themselves, had one chance to
equalise with a fairly simple penalty,
but the ball sailed wide and we had
won!
I.C. 3, ROTAN S
Despite pouring rain about 2,000
watched "le grand match international",
and in very slimy oonditions the Royan
backs gave occasional glimpses of high-
class handling and running which might
have spelt disaster in dry conditions.
As i t was, the pitch 3O0n became a
morass, with both set3 of forwards
covered with mud (so much so that at
one stage two Frenchmen had a fight
together for some seconds before re-
alising they were playing for the same
team). The I.C. forwards and half-
backs a l l played with great vigour and
a sensible appreciation of the con-
ditions, and one forward dribble in the
second half provided the equalising
try, scored by Hoeksma (to the delight
of a l l Ex A members present). Royan
had scored a fine dropped-goal in the
first half.
So ended a memorable tour, highly
successful on and off the field. On
the field our players rose to the occa-
sion. Particular praise i s due to
Dai Phillips, Ray Gibbons, Barry Lanz
and George Martin who played in a l l
three games and were always in the
thick of the fray.
Off the field many and diverse
were our activities, and they will be
discussed for many years in the Bar.
But the vital factor was that, whether
we were swilling Dubonnet or merely
sipping black coffee, whether we were
resting inertly on our beds or rushing
madly about in dodgems, whether scram-
bling up hills in the Dordogne or in-
advertently alerting the fire-brigade
in Paris, fun and good humour abounded,
and i t was the grand team spirit which
set the seal on a great tour and made
i t unforgettable.

The Press Secretary of the U.S.A.E.

Surely this applies to a l l of us.

W H I L E I.C. W A T C H E D
The annual concert of carols and
Christmas music wa3 given shortly before
Christmas by the Musical Society's Choir,
accompanied by the Jacques Orchestra,
under their conductor -)r. 3ric Brown,
It was very satisfying to note the
marked improvement in their rendition
over the past year, which is in no small
measure due to Dr. Brown's leadership
and his understanding of student idio-
3yncracies. Along with the tradition-
al carols, in their usual gui3e, was the
original setting of "While shepherds
watched ..." which came as a pleasant
relief from the rather hackneyed ver-
sion usually sung, and an arrangement
of a. Americal carol.
They also performed Parry's
"Blest pair of sirens", previously
heard in the Albert Hall on Commemo-
ration Day; the improvement in this
work was such that one wondered i f i t
were the same choir that was being
heard.
In conclusion, i t i s to be hoped
that their improvement will continue,
and that a performance worthy of their
capabilities will be given of Bach's
B Minor Mass later this term. It i s
unfortunate that the Musical Society
is so dependent on the financial support
of the Union and the College Authorit-
ies that i t cannot have an Orchestra
whose size is in keeping with the work
performed, rather than the small string
orchestra and piano with which they
have to make do.
.A SUCCESSFUL TOUR
