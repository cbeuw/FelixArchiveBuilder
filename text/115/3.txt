One of the longest Council meet-
ings en record took pit., on December
9th. It lasted from 6 p.m. until 11,
with a break for dinner. Most ef the
time was taken up by the presentation
and'dlscussion of the reports ef rep-
resentatives on committees — there
were thirteen of these.
On the subject of Exploration,
Council felt that there was insuffic-
ient scope for student discission and
planning. The Board was sot able to
make suggestions, and disclaimed a l l
responsibility, although a leaflet
was being produced for the benefit of
students and firms. However, the ad-
vice and contacts of individual m
e
m
-
bers of the Board were valuable and
the j • -loosed Society ought to co-op-
erate fully with them. Feeling was
that the Secretary of the Board was
the best person to handle the urgent-
ly needed n»V i - 1 publicity.
Presenting the -report of the Ent-
ertainments Committee, i t s chairman,
Kr Streets, said that they felt that
the term's hops had left something to
be desired. They had been overcrowded
and low In tone, and the women's col-
leges were complaining. Accordingly
the number admitted would be reduced
from 460 to about SSO, of which 150
would be en double tickets, and an
effort made to keep out non-I.C. men.
Council were not unanimous i n their
approval. Bid the opinion of Council
re preseat that of the Union at large;
Obviousxy many people liked the hops
as they were. Replying, Mr Streets
•aid that his committee had no dog-
matic ideas and, while they were re-
solved te Improve matters, would ex-
periment to find the best ways of
doing so.
Mr Hodgson, ohalrman of the Soo-
i a l Clubs Committee, reported that
four m
e
w societies had received pre-
liminary approval) they were the
Billiards, Exploration, Chinese and
Church of England. This brought up
the question of the organ!sati , of
8.C.C. The general opinion seemed to
be that S.C.C. was quite unwieldy,
and the fact emerged that some m
e
m
-
bers had been walking out of meetings
after their own business bad been
dealt with. Accordingly two motions
were passed:(1) That S.C.C. should
summit proposals for streamlining and
fer the existence ef elube to be
clarified each year (11) That the
P A S T C L O S I N G T I M E
S.C.C. executive should Investigate
the formation of clubs with respect
to the number of votes in favour.
Following the discussion at the
Union meeting on the organisation of
the cloakroom in the Union, several
suggestions were made on how this
could be improved. It was deoided
that two attendants were necessary at
rush hewraand one at a l l other times)
i t w i l l also be neoessarv to have
someone to man the tele;; one when the
extensions are put in. A proposal that
the President shoul'1
engage suffic-
ient staff was carried.
It Is proposed to hold an inter-
national Student Conference in the
College from April 11th to 19th.
About twenty visitors from European
universities are being invited and
the projected programme includes dis-
cussions on university l i f e and v i -
sits to places of interest.
POINTS FROM THE MEETING

Towards the end of last term, the
Dramatic Society (vigorously assisted
by two members of the Rugger Club)
presented "The Firstborn" by Christopher
Fry. Set in Egypt around 1200 B.C.,
the play, concerned the struggles of'
Moses with the Egyptian Pharaoh.
Despite a pot of paint being
emptied over one of the completed flats
on the day of the dress rehearsal the
curtain went up (almost) on time.
Although perhaps getting off to a
rather slow start the play gathered in
momentum and was enjoyed by the small
but, on the whole, appreciative
audience.
Following the final night of tho
production the Society revived an old
custom of having a semi-formal dinner.
During the brief speeches praise wa3
given where deserved, and in particu-
lar to the quiet efficiency of the
producer. After dinner the members
and quests returned to the concert
hall for- the stage hands play (a
mimicry of the actual production),
and one or two surprise ditties by
members of the cast. Then ensued an
all-night party, much enjoyed by a l l .

The General Studies,lecture, on Thurs.
9th Jan., by Prof. R.T.Jones (Prof, of
Natural Philosophy at Aberdeen) on the

well supported, having an audience of
roughly 400 as compared with an attend-
ance of only 15 people at the more
serious alternative lecture on "The
Social Structure of Industrial Concerns?
by Elliot Jaques. The latter lecture
was highly praised by those whs
attended.
As Prof. Jones entered the Physics
Lecture Theatre a young lady asoendea
a ladder encountering some difficulty
through her high-heeled shoes and tight

and amusing lecture which incorporated

intervals. After a vote of thamks
Prof. Jones produced a revolver ami
Indicated that be had eeme fully are-
pared for any out-ef-aana sltaatlea
which might hare arisen.
