University Champions Again
The flag flew again above the Union
when the Club won the University Champ-
ionships on See. 7th., for the second
year i n succession. The expected
close struggle with L.S.E. did not
materialise due to the unfortunate
illness of some L.S.E. men, and
I.C.C.C.C. walked away with the Cup,
unchallenged. No praise is too high
for the magnificent performances of
the I.C. f i r s t team. John Evans was
the Individual winner for the third
year i n succession, and the whole
team had the incredibly low score of
M points. Their positions were:
J.S.Evans 1st., J.E.Collins 3rd.,
J.Conway 6th., R.Landbeck 10th.,
A.Brown 16 th.
The second team also did well to
finish sixth, being beaten only by the
five major College first teams.
The annual Club handicap race was
held on V/ed. llth.Dec. and, for the
f i r s t time in many years, the handi-
caps were determined on a fair basis
giving a l l an equal chance of winning.
This caused a very close finish, and
M.Clare i s to be congratulated on his
victory.
In the vacation a team of eight
travelled to Dover, in one car and
a reluctant vehicle which absorbed a l l
its passengers' energy in getting i t
there, so that the team were defeated
by Dover A.C. i n the match that follow-
ed.
The f i r s t match this term was on the
home course against Lloyds Bank and
Pearl Insurance. The latter defeated
our second *eaa, whilst the result
against Lloyds was declared void due
to several runners going off course,

I.C. Sailing Club narrowly beat
Hampton Sailing Club at the Welsh
Harp on Sunday, Bee. 12th., after two
of the closest races seen for a long
time.
In the f i r s t race I.C. had the f i r s t
two boats home - the whole fleet of
six finishing within 50 yards. The
second race looked like giving Hampton
a runaway win, until on the last leg
of the course Graham Taylor, by
clever tactics, reversed the race pos-
itions, giving I.C. a win by one
point.
I.C. 37& pts. H.S.C. 36$ pts.

With the Club started on the second
half of the season, i t is an opportune
moment to look back and review the Club's
progress during the Autumn Term. Very
few matches were lost and there was an
abundance of goals.All four teams were
well placed in the Intercollegiate
league. Indeed, i t was easy to vis-
ualise at least a hat-trick of divis-
ional championships by the end of the
season. However, i t is unwise to count
one's chickens, etc. and last term's
excellent record must be maintained
before the championships become
reality.
The Club spirit has never been higher,
and there is l i t t l e difficulty in field-
ing 10 teams per week. The f i f t h XI,
newly created this season, have perfor-
med very creditably, fully justifying
the Hon. Seo's. efforts in arranging
many fixtures at short notice.
The 1st XI ended last term with
matches against Heidelberg University
and Finchley 'A'. The German side
brought Continental football to Harl-
ington, the first for a long time. The
Germans, with the wind and rain behind
them, played fast, attractive football
giving the I.0. defence much to contend
with, Heidelberg took an early lead
when the wind ourled an apparently
harmless centre into the I.C. net.
After this rather fortunate goal,
Heidelberg asserted their superiority
and soored two more excellent goals,
both from £0 yards range. In the second
half, the conditions favoured I.C. and
i t was the Germans' turn to come under
constant pressure. I.C.'s many efforts
at goal were foiled by a pecked defence
I.C. did score what appeared to be two
perfectly good goals, but the referee
was not impressed. Tne final score of
3-0 to.Heidelberg was I.C.'s biggest
defeat of the season. After the match
and the lunch the German side was taken
to Wembley to see the Varsity match and
thereafter back to I.C. for dinner and
beer. Heidelberg were most impressed
and expressed their desire to return
this hospitality in the future.
The final game of the term against
Finchley was played in the impressive
surroundings of Finchley Stadium, and,
I.C. felt indeed honoured. The College
provided football worthy of the oooasion
in the first half and three good goals
were scored to the opponents' one.
During the second half, which was goal-
less, the game deteriorated somewhat,
and I.C, appeared content with a 3-1
win.
The Spring Term began with a 2-2 draw
against Q.M.C. and so another league
point has been lost. Perhaps I.C.'s
performance can be put down to the
Christmas break from regular football
as in the next match, against the power-
ful St. Mary's College side, I.C. played
much better football and finished win-
ners by 2-0. The first goal oams from
an inoredible move involving only Jeff
Moss, Dave Young and Keith Codling who
put the finishing touch to the movement.
The Ist XI have a very strong pro-
gramme ahead, but the present combinat-
ion should be equal to the task.
The Fourth XI, who have attracted
attention by their 100% record of last
term, have since added another resound-
ing victory to their tally.

The 1st. XI have continued their
most successful season by beating
both Royal Naval College, Greenwich,
and Guy's Hospital. The Greenwich
match was played in exceptionally
muddy conditions and a score of 4
goals to 1 (King 1, Miller 1, Bhat-
nagar 2)was an apt reward. Guy's were
also beaten decisively by 4 goals to
1, the scorers being Holmes (1),
Lee (2), and Hlller(l).
In a recent U.l. Cup match, I.C.
drew 2 - 2 with U.C. , after being 2 -
1 up only twenty seconds before the
final whistle. In the subsequent
extra time Macrae saved a penalty bully
The 2nd. and 3rd. teams are main-
taining a high standard of hookey and
are, on oooasions, able to win their
matches. A recent 3 - 1 win against
the Institute of Education gave the
2nd. team renewed enthouslasm, and
they are expected to do well in the
coming term.

NETBALL
It was with great trepidation that .
I.C.W.A. approached their first Netball
match of the season. Not only were they
nine months out of practice, but their
captain was down with 'flu, and Chelsea
Polytechnic had a reputation for
excellence. When, therefore, they
suddenly discovered that they were play-
ing quite a good game they were very
encouraged.
Although relying mors on accurate
shooting than on organised teamwork,
they kept level with Chelsea throughout
the first half, first one then the other
team drawing ahead, but never with
more than on* goal load. In the second.
half, however, Chelsea adopted some
of I.C.'s own trloka and I.C.W.S.C.
wore not able to improve their speed
or accuracy of throwing, so that the
final score was 13 - 9 to Chelse
Obviously a l i t t l e more practice as
a team could bring I.C. some Botball
viotories.
