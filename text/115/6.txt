THE FIRSTBORN
REVIEWED
Since Fry first became a "must"
on the book-shelves of the theatre-
lovers of I.C., the possibility of
attempting The Firstborn has presented
Itself whenever choice of a play was
discussed. Here we have the post-
war "shot-in-the-arm" of English
theatre exonerating himself from any
accusation of shallowness that might
follow such whimsical pieces as
"The Phoenix Too Frequent" or "The
Lady's not for Burning*, both pre-
viously seen at the College.
A tirade, based on the eldest
and most impressive "birth of a
nation" story of Moses in Egypt
and clothed in the effervescent
Cwse of Fry, calls for virtuous!ty
in the oast — and, most important,
in their voices. The advent of a
"type-oast" handful of senior m
e
m
-
bers and a very promising group of
freshers apparently launched the
venture, and the production seen at
the end of last term should have left
past members of the Society satisfied
with decision to go on where others
had feared to tread.
Direction was in the hands of
Colin Dixon for the f i r s t time - his
experience of stage matters showed
oleari,i' in well-conceived sets
maJC-js full use of the new theatre's
height and facilities. Especially
striking was an opening scene on
the palace balcony where the much-
vaunted cyclorama lent the final
touch to an Egyptian summer. His
stage crew backed him well with
structures of plausible solidarity
and excellent colour - but the tim-
ing of 3cona changes needed reduc-
ing to more professional limits.
More rehearsal seemed a remedy and
It i s in this that I found the weak
link of the play.
Spence and Allen were formidable
and obvious corner-stones of the cast
- Hoses, the sincere and ideallstiic
orator got a l l the oratory needed
from' the now-familiar, rich Allen
voice. Joining him in authorative
use of voice and movement, Mike
Spence's 'Ramases' gave conviction
to the whole Royal household. The
newcomer, Sheila Burbidge, next
claimed attention - a very success-
ful sketch of the young Pharaoh's
daughter and one that bodes well for
the future strength of the company.
Peter Morgan played Shendi - one of
the moat difficult parts in a d i f f i -
cult play - as perhaps no-one else
could have done. Iris Dickinson
joined the ranks of the "known"
actresses and grappled in an assured
manner with the discrepancy in years
between herself and her part.
Angela Lance had a similar problem
and I warmly applaud this fresher
for her attempt.
If I have left Desmond Turner
to the last i t i s to make a general
point rather than a particular
criticism. As with other activities
in the College, the experienced "old
hand" i s becoming rarer and here was
a case of enthusiasm and potentiality
largely lost by gross short-comings
In technique. The voioe was strong -
at times - but confidence will not
clear a throat. And, oh those
gestures An hour's firm
correction would have doubled the
value of his performance - this year
we see an unusually talented "crop"
of new arrivals, i t is to be hoped
TWICE A KNIGHT
S O C I A L P R E V I E W
Socially speaking, last term was
one of the best for some time- — the
success seems likely to continue. As
far as major functions are concerned,
The Ball is set rolling by the Engin-
eers on January 31st. The dance w i l l
be preceded by dinner i n the Upper
Dining Hall, where the tables will be
arranged as for Hall Dinner, and i n
the Upper Refectory, where there w i l l
be separate tables for parties.
On February 14th (St Talentlne's
Day) the Miners present a Carnival -
perhaps the Queen ef Hearts will
bring some of her tarts along for
breakfast.
One month later, on march 14th,
the B.C.3. gives birth to another
Carnival. Can even I.C. men survive
two such carnalvalistic orgies with-
in such a short period? There can
be l i t t l e hope for the survival of
I.C.W.A. — their Foraal Dance Is on
March 7th.

that every effort will be made to
nurture them. Terry Wright showed
how observation and control can lead
to a character i n a few momenta.
Finally, I welcome this play
whioh can give much to both players
and audience - just recompense for
the expenditure of valuable univers-
ity time.
Two last bouquets - for the
success and economy of the homo-;
costumes - and for the Rugger Club,
long may then continue to grace the
Imperial stage.
