Speculation an the fate of the Coleutt tower, orowning glory of the ahortly-to-
be-lamented Imperial Ioatltute, has recently teen revived as a remit of the pub-
lication of the estimated cost of keeping i t .
It will be recalled that two years ago the proposal to completely demolish the
Institute aroused much antagonism among the natives of Kensington, whereupon the
Government decided that the tower should he left standing. The College was requested
to plan the development of the site accordingly and to investigate the oost of the
retention, both ef whioh have been done. The estimated price of this compromise will
he £250,000, to which must ef course he added the detrimental effect on the develop-
ment scheme as originally put forward. One i s reminded of the oaption to a cartoon
In the EVENIHG STAHDAHD of March 15,1956: "If they'd get as worked up about the Emp-
ire as they do about i t s monuments, we might s t i l l have an Empire to get worked up
•bout."

Viewpoint *
While the Government has stated that i t wishes the tower to be kept, i t has not
•aid whether *he money required will he forthcoming. It is not altogether Inconceiv-
able that another compromise he suggested.
Not unsurprisingly then, the
position with regard to the island
site i s somewhat unsettled.However,
considerable progress has been made
in the last two years with the plans
for the site, and latterly with the
buildings for the new Physios and
Engineering blocks,,
The building for the Physios
department i s under way and i s on
time, so far. There appears to be
nothing at the moment that could
aTfeot the completion dates, although
there are s t i l l some points under
discussion between the Department
and the Architects. The block facing
(Jueen1
s Gate should be finished by
the start of the Spring Term in 1959,
and the block facing Prinoe Consort
Road by the beginning of the session
1959-60.
There has been some delay in the
progress of the new Engineering block,
as the design of the steelwork is
being modified following upon com-
ments by the University Grants Com-
mittee. However the original compl-
etion date, i.e. the start of the
Session 1959-60, i s s t i l l envisaged.

On the evening of Boring Day, 2if
good men and true met i n the Queen's
before delivering a challenge to the
formidable rugby playing talent of
the Bordeaux region of France. The
channel crossing was uneventful except
that Otto Gilbert studied his limiting
Ticket carefully for some minutes
before realising that i t was not a
telegram, as he had originally sup-
posed. The first evening was spent
in Paris where the party joined in
the gay and varied night-life with
uninhibited enthusiasm and considerable
versatility (details censored).
After the long coach journey to
Saintes, during whioh i t was hoped the
after-effects of Paris would wear off,
proceedings began with the first of
two vigorous training sessions.
In a 12 a-side t r i a l the "Drunks*
(without Hoaksma) beat the "Sobers*
(plus Hoaksma) 13-12. Reassured
that they could s t i l l play rugger, the
party went on to Sariat, a town in the
wooded h i l l s of the Dordogne, where
enthusiasm for rugby runs very high.
Greeted by large banners bearing the
word "WBL'COME", I.e. were plunged
into a New Tear's Ball, where those
selected to play on the following day
revealed commendable restraint.
At this function, and on many
other occasions, I.e. made brave
efforts to converse with the French
in their own language, and made many
friends. The Entente Cordiale has
never been stronger. Barry Lans
astonished his men by his fluency at
French, although some others seemed
miraculously to acquire similar
powers after a few vite Dubonnets.
However the vocabulary of D. Phillips
appeared to extend l i t t l e beyond
"oui", "oombien", and *ou est l a
toilette?", while Milward was in
frequent trouble. Once he was given
oysters when he thought he had ordered
soup, and on another occasion thought
the company was estimating the distance
of Sarlat from Paris when in fast i t
waa discussing the price of mushrooms.
