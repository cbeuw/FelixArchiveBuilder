Unregistered
but still a student
Piers Corbyn returned to the limelight in Thursday's UGM — and
succeeded in retaining his place on Imperial College's NUS confer-
ence delegation.
Early last week, Martin Black sent Piers a letter informing him that,
since he was not a registered student, he would be ineligible to repre-
sent Imperial College Union at the Margate conference in three
weeks' time. Piers' grant ran out during the summer, and his policy
has been that as long as he can continue his studies at the College
without paying his registration fees he will do so.
Piers thwarted attempts
by the Union executive to
silence him at the meeting
on the grounds that he
was not a member of the
Union by revealing that he
had, that morning, bought
life membership.
He said that, if neces-
sary, he would go and reg-
ister with the college—but
pointed out that the Union
should honour their elec-
tion of May last, and ac-
cept him as a member of
the delegation regardless of
this.
Martin Black had said
that Piers had pledged at
the May delegation elec-
tion, that he would be a
registered student at the
time of the conference.
The arguments were in-
terrupted by Mike Doh-
erty, Academic Affairs
officer, who proposed that
the Union should accept
the earlier election and let
Piers go to the conference.
This motion was passed
by a sizeable majority.
Vote of Confidence
Immediately after this
"vote of confidence in
Piers" Martin Black re-
signed from the delegation,
leaving 3 places to be
filled from the six candi-
dates standing. The other
two vacancies were caused
by the non-return to col-
lege of Brenda Dilley, and
the lack of a President.
The delegation consists of
4 delegates and 2 observ-
ers: those already going
were Rob Armitage (Ex-
ternal Affairs Officer), —
and Piers Corbyn.
Top of the poll for the
remaining places was Tre-
vor Phillips, who will now
(with Rob Armitage) be
one of the only 2 of our
delegation who have been
to Conference before, fol-
lowed Closely by C. Ding-
ley, a newcomer to the col-
lege Who was previously
on the Executive of the
South African Union of
Students, and Bill Gerrard,
Bo leaving Hyde Park on Sunday morning for the start of the London-Brighton
run. Unfortunately we cannot print a picture of the finish—British Rail failed
to deliver the film on time.
VANDALS SMASH FLOAT
C & G out of
Lord Mayor's Show?
last year's President of the
Royal College of Science
Union. The other 3 candi-
dates, J. Ashworth (a
Maths Fresher), P. Gillett
(a prominent lefty who has
just returned to college)
and Miss S. Hochfelder
(External Affairs secre-
tary and another confirm-
ed lefty), were very much
also-rans.
The meeting, which
looked decidedly inquor-
ate (no-one challenged it),
lacked much other interest,
most of the business being
reports from the Acting
President and Honorary
Secretary.
City and Guild's float for the Lord Mayor's Show,
to be held next Saturday, was removed from its place
of construction underneath the walkway on Friday
morning and was wrecked by vandals.
The culmination of three
weeks' work, thefloatwas
to depict a giant spanner,
representing City and
Guilds, resting on a giant
nut, representing the rest
of the college.
Expensive materials
have now been wasted,
and it seems doubtful as
to whether further supplies
will be purchased. Steven
Wright, in charge of the
construction of the float,
told "Felix" that the delay
caused by this could pre-
vent C&G appearing in the
Show. "The malicious
damage of property serves
no useful purpose, as far
as we can see, and we hope
that in future the persons
responsible show more re-
straint in their actions", he
said.
C&G officials claimed
on Friday night that the
damage was caused by a
constituent college union
other than RCS, but no
confirmation has been re-
ceived.
