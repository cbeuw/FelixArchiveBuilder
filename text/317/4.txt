When is a
flatlet not
a flatlet?
Sir—It is with some inter-
est that I con the plan of the
proposed Northside Hall
"Flatlet" layout so thought-
fully provided by your staff.
However, a ripple of dis-
quiet disturbs the mill-pond
of my mind, a hint of recog-
nition. The source is this—
what is so special about the
Northside scheme that the
standard Weeks and Lin-
stead Hall layout of eight
bedrooms, two bogs, kitchen,
cupboard and bathroom is
suddenly transformed into a
"Flatlet"? The scheme is as
good as could be expected,
given the limitations of fin-
ance and space, . . . but why
should it be euphemised?
I am. Sir, your euphem-
istically,
ROB CARTER,
Weeks Flatlet 2.
Cleaning up
Southside
Sir—Further to the letter
from Mr. Leachman with re-
gard to the state of Linstead
car park: he may be interest-
ed to learn that City and
Guilds' Motor Club has al-
ready been looking into this
matter. .
Over the past few years,
C6G MC has always taken
an interest in the conditions
available for student car
parking in college. This year
the club has tried to continue
the same interest.
Several scrap cars have al-
ready been removed to the
Council dump, with the full
approval and co-operation of
the college security depart-
ment, and the remainder of
the rubbish should follow
very soon.
In order to move these
cars the Bo driver has usual-
ly kindly loaned Bo's trailer,
but of course if anyone has a
suitable towing vehicle and
would care to help out, the
club would be very pleased
to hear from them via the
CBG Union Office.
One must also pause to
recall how this state of affairs
came about. If those who use
the car parks to do their re-
pairs would have more con-
sideration for others and es-
pecially for those who have
to clear up the mess, then
this topic would never have
been brought up.
Perhaps these communica-
tions will make some people
think a little more.
Thank you for letting me
"Get it off my chest".
Yours sincerely,
"THE GREEN
SCREAMER".

Protection:
not a racket?
Sir—In one of your small
advertisements last week
(Issue 316) it was stated
that car vandalism was rife
at IC and that donations
sent to Paul Hosking at the
Rag Office would prevent
this. I would like to clarify
the situation. Neither myself
nor my committee are in
any way concerned with the
running of a protection rack-
et, which is plainly inferred
by the advertisement. (Yeah,
but does it contravene the
Trades Description Act? —
Ed.).
As I explained in my article
in the last issue of "Felix"
. . . (the writer here explains
in great detail what he ex-
plained last week.—Ed.).
There are 674,675 parking
spaces at Imperial College
(incorrect—Ed.) which are
given away free of charge—
a donation of 25p or so for
a year's parking and also
protection of your vehicle
does not seem expensive. So
I would urge all owners of
cars parked at IC to send
their donations to the Union
Office: cheques should be
made payable to the Imperial
College Carnival Charities
Account. Do not forget the
number of your car: you will
be issued with a sticker to
ensure that your car is pro-
tected from the ravages of.
vandals.
May I once again stress
that neither myself nor the
rag committee are in any
way connected with the run-
ning of a protection racket in
IC. Our sole aim is to pro-
tect cars against vandals.
Yours sincerely,
PAUL HOSKING.
Unclear
Clarification
Sir—/ am writing to you
as in the future in the hope
that this letter will help to
clarify the situation regard-
ing the Return of the Land-
snapper Sneeze.
While the cartoon itself is
only likely to have a harm-
ful effect on the few people
who have the intellectual
prowess necessary to read in
its present abridged form,
the real danger lies in the
"ramblings" printed above it.
Are these really ramblings
or are they something more
sinister? The main clue to
their origin lies in the first
sentence. You too may have
noticed that it starts at the
beginning. This fundamental
discovery has far reaching
consequences (see Psycho-
logical Warfare and its ap-
plication t o Suspension
Bridges, Vol. MLXXII page
12a dated September 31st
1635) especially for the in-
habitants of the Inner Aster-
oids. Unfortunately they are
unable to make a full state-
ment on the present econo-
mic situation without a more
complete picture on which to
base their assessment.
One does not realise the
true subversive nature of the
article until a few lines from
the end " . . . including a
plot". The author has the
audacity to admit to includ-
ing a plot: planning permis-
sion for three bungalows and
an oil refinery in a compact
area of approximately
.000539 acres. Sold prior to
auction.
I hope this cleared up any
misunderstandings on the
part of your readers.
Further information may
be obtained by writing to
the address shown below
(postcards and blank
cheques only please).
Yours etc.,
The Secretary,

of the Society for the

Election
Rigging:
Denial by C&G
Sir,
The aftermath of the recent
ICU Presidential Elections
has shown a lot of criticism
of the action taken by the
officers of the CCU's imme-
diately prior to that election.
A meeting of City and
Guilds Union on October 31st
unanimously supported the
action taken by the CCU's
and recommended that a let-
ter should be sent to you, in
the name of City & Guilds
Union, answering these criti-
cisms.
When we issued our letter
to all our members we did
at no time order them to ab-
stain from the elections. If,
Mr. Editor, you had read the
letter you will see that we
only asked our members to
consider abstaining. We felt
that it had not been made
clear enough to our members
that if they did not agree
with either candidate they
would do better to act posi-
tively by abstaining than by
not voting at all. After all if all
these members had not vot-
ed the results would have
looked far different and
would have been unrepresen-
tative of ICU. Surely, Mr.
Editor, if any of our mem-
bers had formed a prefer-
ence for either candidate
they would have voted for
them, regardless of our let-
ter, so why should the CCU's
be accused of what amounts
to 'rigging' the elections?
You yourself stated that
there was 'a great increase in
the lack of comprehension of
the election procedure, since
a third of the electorate had
only three weeks experience
of the College and Union'. So
surely, Mr. Editor, we were
helping to increase the com-
prehension of the procedure
by making our members
aware of their right to ab-
stain. You make it appear in
Felix No. 316 that the CCU's
were wholly responsible for
the continuing absence of a
President for ICU but as
shown in your own Felix poll
a large proportion ot ICU
members were already going
to abstain before our letter
was issued.
City 6 Guilds constitution
Section 2—1 states that 'the
object of the union shall be
the furtherance of the . . .
welfare of the members'. We
genuinely feel that the letter
was for the welfare of our
members, and that any accu-
sations to the contrary are
completely unfounded.
Further we would like to
state that at present the
Presidents of the CCU's are
working with the remainder
of ICU Executive to find a
suitable candidate for ICU
President. We hope that the
next election will yield just
such a person.
Yours sincerely,
pp the members of

Society
Stinks
Sir,
I feel I must inform you
that there is no way out for
humanity. Stop producing
junk, cars, consumer trash.
Save resources, protect the
environment. Force the coun-
try to unemployment, so in-
troduce work sharing. Too
much leisure, make the work-
ers make things for them-
selves to play with in their
spare time. Do you workers
realise that all these consum-
er goods you produce are
consumed by you. Is it the
capitalists conning you to
buy junk, or are you conning
them to keep you in work.
Of course, who will say what
is unnecessary production,
me, you, "them", autocracy
works my friends, so get
screwed brothers. You might
as well be an apathist. Duck
to avoid the terrorists' bomb,
subsist, breathe, eat, shit,
sleep and die. Of course, it's
the struggle of the working
class against faceless op-
pressors. O.K. take your
choice friends, either the
same pay for all, no incen-
tive to better (what does that
mean now), oneself, unless
it's to get the cushy job, or
more status.
Status, that must be it-
Status, or do we have the
same system as at present,
only displace the hereditary
capitalists with temporary
ones. Introduce legislation to
prevent such parasites? Im-
posed by who? A police state
brother. Corruption, never.
Of course, education is the
problem. We are always
brought up on anti-left propa-
ganda. What are your inten-
tions, anti-right propaganda.
Let us go away and freak out
in our own apathetic little
way. I can't take any more
of your drivel society, its
overtones and under state-
ments, its overlords and
underground hogs. It stinks.
Peace.
B. Wildered.
