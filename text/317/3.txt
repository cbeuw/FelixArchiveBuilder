Status Quo in
Concert
Here we are in the Great Hal! Projection room. Hey
that's a nice headset and microphone. I wonder where
it leads.
"Hello!"
"Hello, is that the Projection Room? Listen, this is
Status Quo's manager, I'm backstage. When I give
the signal I want you to wait one minute then fade
out the music and announce—'And now for some good
old English rock and roll—Status Quo'.
"Okay, will do . . . " The guitarists are all
Hello? Yes, that was a moving together. That's
good reception they got.
Pity about those people at
the front who won't sit
down. Do this group al-
ways ' attract unpleasant
teeny-boppers like these?
Oh. Sorry. Look I can't
hear you. The group's too
loud. If the lights have to
be just so you'd better
send someone up—the
lighting bloke can't hear
you either. What do I
think of them? Well, the
guitarists toss their flow-
ing hair about a bit. Like
that bloke in Grand Funk
Railroad. Yes, I suppose
they're better than them,
if you say so. Good music
to what? Oh. move to.
Look, these 'phones are
useless when the group
plays, it was pointless put-
ting them in really. Is this
"In my chair"—that was
their single wasn't it? Fun-
ny, it sounds just like the
last three.
exciting is it? Yes, I can
see that the whole crowd
is on its feet. That's be-
cause those people would
not sit down at the front,
is'nt it? Oh, no, I can see
they're dancing now. No,
it only makes me want to
dance to an all-night ear-
plug wholesaler. I can't
hear you, wait 'till the end
of the number. Blimey,
this is a long number—
yes as a matter of fact I
did recognise it as the
Doors "Roadhouse Blues".
Was that you playing har-
monica? Far out. Goes on
a bit though. Long but vig-
orous did you say—like a
donkey's—ah, they've fin-
ished. Now what were you
trying to say? Don't I like
them? No, they make my
ears ache. Yes, I agree the
crowd loves it and we've
made some money. They're
coming back for a well-
deserved encore. Why has
their guitarist played only
two notes for the last min-
ute? That's not music. You
don't think it matters. It's
"Bye Bye Johnny" isn't
it? Well thank you sir and
goodnight.
Earlier in the evening
the crowd was entertained
by Capability Brown, who
played some nice music,
both electric and acoustic,
but who over shot their
time allocation and had
the plug pulled out on
them, and The New York
Dolls, who had only been
booked two days previous-
ly. They are one of the lat-
est American camp bands,
and for the first five min-
utes their decorative garb
was quite amusing—the
drummer particularly
looked like a real dead
doll—and as a rock and
roll band they were more
than competent, still, I
suppose Alice Cooper beat
them to it. Apparently
Mick Jagger and all of
The Faces had come to see
them. A pity they didn't
go down too well, and a
pity they werent' topping
the bill— I could write a
lot more on them than I
could about Status Quo.
They weren't as loud as
Status Quo — that must
have been why.
Bo Belie
Here's Bo Belle pictured with her namesake in Downing Street. No one knew
what her name was (at 9 p.m. on Sunday night) but she lives in Selkirk Hall,
if you're interested . . . and who isn't?

Andrzej Kuhn's Exhibition continues of the Consort Gallery
There has been a distinct lack of facilities for those
IC students who have not grown out of two-wheeled
motorised transport. This sad state of affairs has stirred
many thousands of thousandths of students to voice
their dissent. Why, they ask, should an innocent minor-
ity be suppressed by the jackboot of the four-wheel
fanatics? Why should those, who only ask for a simple
existence, burning up traffic queues on their Norton
Commandos and Honda 50's be subjected to complete
rejection by the rest of society?
But now a group of high-minded intellectuals have
decided that this state of affairs cannot, nay will not,
continue. They have cleverly talked circles round the
slow yokels in the Motor Club, persuading them to
form a motor-cycle section. So, two-wheelers of the
world unite, you need no longer practice your hobbies
in the back streets, bring everything out into the open.
The first meeting is being held at 5.30 p.m. on
Tuesday, 7th November, in the C & C Union Office
(Mech Eng Level 3). That is, TODAY. BE THERE.
Sponsored Walk
The SUK sponsored walk for Rage will take place on
Sunday, November 26th (the last day in Rag Week).
It is only a twelve mile stroll, starting at Maria
Assumpta at about two o'clock, finishing at QEC,
where there will be FREE refreshments, and an amaz-
ing orgy (oops, sorry, I meant Disco). Sponsor Sheets
are available from your constituent college union office,
so go and get some now ! ! !
