Absolutely the last
IAN MACKENZIE'S
PRESIDENT'S C
O
L
U
M
N
The last month has not been an easy one for ICU. A Union with a
temporary president is handicapped in that there is unlikely to be the
usual degree of continuity over the year. The lack of a publicity
officer and moreover the non-availability of much of the Union build-
ing further handicapped the Union. However, the non-election of a
President at the last elections must surely be the most severe blow.
ICU vs CCU's
Last year relations be-
tween ICU and the Con-
stituent College Unions
were very good, with the
CCU's being predomin-
antly social units within
ICU. However, the hand
that the CCU leaders took
in the ICU presidential
elections has made many
people feel that we're re-
turning to the bad old
days. I don't believe that
this is the case, and ex-
pect the CCU's to do all
they can to ensure that
ICU gets a good president,
and to continue to sup-
port ICU.
lAN'S VIEW
Despite my relatively
short stay as President,
there are a number of
ideas that I must try to
pass on. Over the last 3
years, the Union made
considerable advances in
both representation on
college bodies and pro-
motion of Union policies,
often at a cost of good
relations with the admin
of the College. The Union
is now settling down to
USE its greater influence
in the College, and rela-
tions with admin are now
very good. I hope that this
state continues.
As far as the Union it-
self, the most unsatisfac-
tory areas are the old
stumbling blocks of infor-
mation, communication
and Union Meetings.
UNION MEETINGS
Union meetings can
only be really meaningful
if above 600 people at-
tend. At present they are
roughly every two or three
weeks and are generally
concurrent with other
lunch time events. I
would like to see ONE
Union Meeting per month
(with first lecture in the
afternoon cancelled so
that the meeting could
run from 1.15 to 3.15)
with nothing in competi-
tion with it (i.e. STOIC
could run from 12.45 to
13.15). Only then could
Union meetings be seen
to be important, and
worthwhile.
I N F O R M A T I O N
And now for a few
quick ideas. The Room at
the Top should be fully
operative as an informa-
tion centre, but there is
still a need for someone
(information officer?) to
spend the first couple of
weeks of terms compiling
the Union Directory and
then looking after the in-
formation side at the
Room at the Top and the
great amount of outside
bumph sent to the Union
Office.
Also it is about time we
had a NUS secretary
whose responsibility is just
to look after the masses
of bumph sent by NUS to
each constitutent organ-
isation. This burden at
present falls on either the
President or the External
Affairs Officer.
Lastly, communication.
I've no doubt a weekly
Felix is helping greatly
here, but ICU still needs
to improve its use of the
three main notice board
areas.
Finally, I'd like to wish
whoever takes on the post
of President the very best
of luck, and to thank
MCB and PWI for the
work they've already put
in.
Cumberland Lodge — Garden View
A way from it all. . .
You may have been to a Touchstone weekend at Silwood Park — but did
you know that, only a short distance away in Windsor Great Park, similar week-
end conferences for students are held at "Cumberland Lodge"?
Administered by the "King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Foundation of
St. Catherine's," Cumberland Lodge, offers regular Friday evening to Monday
morning residential conferences on wide-ranging topics at £4.75. Perhaps a great
advantage over "Touchstone" weekends is that these give an opportunity to meet
and discuss with students of other disciplines from other University colleges,
Polytechnics and Colleges of Education. ^
Forthcoming weekends include "Chomsky and the Revolution in Linguistics"
on December lsl-3rd, "The Value of News Film to the Historian" (December
15th-18th), a Music Weekend for all amateur student instrumentalists (lanuary
5th-8th), "The Sea" (Fqbruery 2nd-5th), and later ones on Cryptography (codes),
Genetics and Heretics and several other subjects.
. St. Catherine's is also open to students for private study. It has well-equipped
single study-bedrooms, libraries, reading rooms and good recreational facilities —
all for only £10 a week.
If you would like further information, send your name and address to Felix,
Union, Office, by Internal mail marking it "St. Catherine's", and we will pass it on
without delay — or come and browse through the brochure in the Felix Office.
Many readers of FELIX will have noticed that there was no MAR-
TIN'S PIT last week. To make up for this loss — due, I am afraid,
to a very busy week culminating in my birthday, Commemoration
Day and the Maths Freshers' Dinner in quick succession, I now offer
to you, dear readers, a double portion of
MARTIN'S BIT
on &e£tgnatiott£
It may come as a shock to some members of I C U
to hear that, at Thursday's U G M I tendered to Ian
Mackenzie on behalf of the Union, my resignation. M y
resignation, N O T as Secretary to the Union (failed
again—Ed.) but as a member and leader of the dele-
gation to the November Conference of the NUS at Mar-
gate.
The reasons for this re-
signation are three-fold
and I feel that the Union
is entitled to a brief ex-
planation.
FIRSTLY, Ian Macken-
zie's term of office as
Acting President, as de-
fined and agreed at the
end of last year, has now
expired and Ian has re-
turned to his structural
vibrations in the bowels of
the Aeronautics depart-
ment. This means that, al-
though Ian will be con-
tinuing, pro tern, as the
titular head of the Union,
he will not be able to de-
vote a great deal of time
to the job and I will, as
the sole sabbatical officer,
have to spend much of
my time doing the more
mundane and routine of
his duties as well as my
own. Thus I will not have
the time to do the re-
searches, background
reading and to generally
make myself au fait with
a good proportion of the
topics that will be dis-
cussed at the conference.
It would be advantageous
to understand the system
that governs the organisa-
tion and administration of
NUS — a bureaucracy
that not even I can
match!!
SECONDLY, the time-
table of the re-election is
such that the ballot will
take place on Friday 24th
and Monday 27th Novem-
ber; this is the weekend
of the conference. I could
appoint an Acting Re-
turning Officer, but would
not feel able to accept
total responsibility for the
running of the election un-
less I organised it person-
ally.
THIRDLY, I have dur-
ing the past month re-
ceived criticism from
various quarters about my
attitudes to the National
Union of Students. IC
Union will learn of these
in due course but suffice
it to say, at the present
time, that I do not think
that we get value for
money out of NUS. I,
personally, do not wish to
help perpetuate a system
in which I have no faith.
I would strongly dis-
pute any suggestion that
my resignation is a re-
action to the attitude of
the Union meeting to Mr.
Corbyn's proposal that he
be allowed to attend the
conference as a represen-
tative of a Union of Stu-
dents of Imperial College
even though, at the time
of the meeting, he was
NOT a full time registered
student of Imperial Col-
lege. I realise that my
actions will be taken by
some to be "sour grapes™
— this was at no time in-
tended.
on Commemoration ©ap
To put the records
straight (i) I was no more
asleep than Lord Sherfield
(Chairman of the Govern-
ing Body) and (ii) Pro-
fessor Sir Derek Barton
was the gentleman wear-
ing the light blue silk hat
that looked like the bas-
tard offspring of a liaison
between a chandelier and
a tea cosy.
The Commemoration
Ball was an unqualified
success. For the first time
in living memory we had
to turn down applications
for tickets because there
was not sufficient room in
the Dining Hall to accom-
modate more than 402
people. Everybody seemed
to be enjoying themselves
and the following day the
Union Office was excep-
tionally quiet, as the Exec,
emerged from the alco-
holic haze into which they
had sunk earlier that
morning, to which end I
insisted that conversation
should take place only in
whispers and that the
telephone bells should be
damped.
on Jlotor ptcpttes
People who bring motor cycles into the college precincts are asked by the College
to register them with the Security Office, Room 164 College Block. If, for instance,
| a fire should occur and it is necessary to contact the owner to ask him to move
the cycle, it will be easier if they know who owns it.
