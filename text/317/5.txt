November 7, 1972 FELIX Page 5
F E L I X F I N A N C I A L L Y
Last month on this page, Derek E. Cummings wrote a scathing
article on the subject of insurance salesmen. In this issue, he
deals with the problem of house prices. These are only the first
of a series of hard-hitting features on the financial world which
FELIX proposes to feature regularly in future issues under the
title " FELIX FINANCIALLY ". In view of the interest already
aroused by his last piece, we thought it worthwhile to ask him
what subjects he expects to write about in the future.
"// you read my last
article — and I hope you
did — you will have
gathered that its purpose
was to strip some of the
mystery surrounding the
business of life assur-
ance. Similarly, the fea-
ture on house prices in
the adjacent columns is
intended to briefly ex-
plain why it is that house
prices continually rise
The aim of "FELIX
Financially" is to pre-
sent all such financial
and commercial prob-
lems that are likely to
affect you in the near
future (if they have not
already done so) with the
same kind of realism. In
other words, to remove
the mystique and reveal
the facts as I see them.
So far, we have taken a
look at insurance and
house prices. Next week
I shall be suggesting
some of the ways in
which the seemingly im-
possible difficulties of
house purchase might be
overcome.
Following that, I shall
have a few words to say
about banks, banking
and bank managers and
their attitude to stud-
ents. We all know what
the banks promise, just
as we know that they do
not always live up to
them. But why should
there be a difference be-
tween the wrapping and
the goods? What should
we —and what can we
— expect from a bank
manager? Well, read and
find out.
Then there are the
other institutions . . . the
Building Societies. I plan
to put the manager of
one of the Big Three
societies through the
hoop and make him ex-
plain to you, in simple
language, what his busi-
ness is and how he goes
about it.
What about student
accommodation ? Now,
there's a subject to raise
the temperature of
nearly all students. Peti-
tions, strikes, demon-
strations and arguments
fill the air — while the
problem gets worse and
worse. I believe I know
what should be done,
what can be done—and,
most important, how it
can be done. It'll take a
whole page of "Felix",
because it's such a big
subject. But it'll be
worth your while read-
ing it.
What do you know
about soliciting ? (or
should I say solicitors? ).
If you ever buy a house,
you'll need one. But is it
necessary to get bogged
down in words before
you get the deeds?
Accountants are an-
other strange breed who
prefer to remain
shrouded in mystery.
They may be of help to
you one day — provided
you understand what you
really need them for.
Few people do.
Motor insurance? A
necessary evil, perhaps.
But why should a motor-
ist insure cheaply with a
backyard company and
risk following Dr. Savun-
dra down the drain? Or
pay through the nose for
respectability? I've more
than a few words to say
on this whole area of
insurance.
So that's it. These are
some of the well-estab-
lished windmills I shall
be tilting my lance at in
the near future. My
articles will be contro-
versial. You may well
disagree with some of
the things I say. You will
want to know more
about others. If you write
to me c/o "Felix", I'll
attempt to answer your
questions. And I'll look
forward to seeing you at
my General Studies lec-
tures in January.
Now read on . . .
12,000 SINGLE
HOMELESS IN
LONDON
In a recent survey organised by the St. Mungo Com-
munity Trust just under 12,000 single homeless men
and women were discovered in London. 1,400 volun-
teers, of which 60 were from Imperial College, took
part in the survey. On the night of Friday, 20th Octo-
ber they searched every street, derelict area and derelict
house in the 15 boroughs of Inner London. Included
in the figures were the homeless people in lodging
houses, prison cells and hospitals.
Of the homeless people Commenting on the sur-
over 1,400 were sleeping vey, Jim Home, director of
the St. Mungo Community
Trust, said "These figures
can only be a guide. In
many areas there were less
men and women than we
have seen on other occa-
sions. We think a number
of dosscirs had "gone to
ground" knowing of the
survey, and police activity
also led to reduced num-
bers". He also said that the
survey wouild be followed
up by a monitoring in the
various areas to compile
comparative figures and
the recruitment of volun-
teers to participate in their
mobile medical unit and
Advisory Centre.
rough, 470 in Westminster
alone. The figure for Ken-
sington was 40. There were
9,000 in common lodging
" houses, 500 in prisons,
over 700 in reception cen-
tres, 246 in hospital and
45 in police custody. No
figure was available for
mental hospitals; the last
survey of these intitutions
was in 1957 when the fig-
ure for no fixed abode in
mental hospitals was 1,500
Before the 20th Octo-
ber, preliminary surveys
carried out in the individ-
ual boroughs. The results
of these differed from
those of the big survey
quite considerably in some
areas. For example the
pilot survey in Westmins-
ter counted 960 dossers.
The survey cannot be
considered to be complete-
ly accurate since in certain
areas the number of dos-
sers counted was excep-
tionally low due to ineffi-
cient organisation. For ex-
ample, in Southwark, a
borough with a high dos-
ser population, the derelict
house squad only covered
half its area. Also the fig-
ure quoted for the number
of dossers in police cells
cannot be considered to be
accurate since, for ex-
ample, Bow Street admit-
ted to having 3 dossers
in custody yet 38 were
brought before the court in
the morning.
The purpose of the sur-
vey was to make the Gen-
eral Public more aware of
the magnitude of the situa-
tion, and the Government
aware of its responsibility
to alleviate this growing
problem. The information
will be correlated in the
form of a paper, to be pre-
sented to the Government
in order that realistic sup-
port be given to the home-
less single person and to
those organisations involv-
ed in helping them.
It is thus not yet known
if the survey was a success.
House prices:
Up, Up and
even further Up
HOUSE PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE:
Some time in the future, we think, the majority
of you are going to get involved in the business of
buying a house. It's going to be an expensive busi-
ness—in fact, the biggest financial deal many of
you will ever do. So it's well worth thinking about.
You may have read recently what appears to be
encouraging news about the future of house prices.
Encouraging, because the tenor of these arguments
is that house prices are now stabilising and that
the boom—or racket, if you prefer—in house prices
is fading away.
Well, we're sorry, but we don't agree.
There are basic eco-
nomic factors which gov-
ern the price of housing,
namely the old bugbear
of supply and demand.
And those factors still
apply—and they'll go on
applying for some time
yet. In short, there are
still too many people
looking for too few
houses, and there will
still be more people
than houses for at least
the next ten years. The
root of the matter is
quite simple. There was
an enormous population
explosion in this country
at the end of the war.
The sociological reasons
forthat are fairly obvious
and well known. What is
not quite so well appre-
ciated is that this popu-
lation boom carried on
until well into the 1950s
—until 1958 to be exact.
PRICES . . .
Now, the parallel be-
tween the population
boom in 1945 and the
dizzy rise in house prices
in the late 1960s and
the early 1970s is quite
exact. All those post-war
babies born in 1945
were, at about 25 years
years old, surging onto
the housing market —
and the boom really be-
gan to go with a bang.
Ok, so now we know
why houses prices went
up so steeply. But let's
just refresh our memor-
ies a moment and look
at a few figures, showing
just how steeply they
did go up.
We'll start with a
three-bedroomed, semi-
detached house built in
1938. It sold then for,
say, six hundred pounds.
Between then and now,
there has been a war and
a consequent population
boom. And this is what
it did to the price of our
house:
1938: It sold for £600.
1945: The end of t he
war. The start of
the population
boom.
1948: The house sold
for £1200.
1951: The population
explosion reflect-
ed in the educa-
tion bulge.
1958: The house sold
for £3,000. The
population growth
slows down.
1968: The house now
worth £6,000.
1969: Still £6,000.
1970: Still £6,000, but
now the 1945
children are be-
ginning to come
onto the house
purchase market.
1971: The house sells
for £7,500. Dem-
and seriously out-
stripping supply.
1972: The house which
sold for £600 34
years ago, now
fetches £12,000.
By 1982, the price of
that same house is like-
ly to be something in the
region of £30,000. And
by 1992? Well, shall we
suggest £80,000?
If you think that ab-
surd, just look back at
the figures. What sold
for £600 in 1938, is to-
day going for £12,000.
In other words, its value
has increased twenty
times in just over thirty
years.
. . . A N D PEOPLE
All right, so a lot of
houses have been, and
are being built, but not
nearly enough to accom-
modate you all—that is,
you, who constitute part
of that vast population
expansion. Furthermore,
there are other factors
which help keep prices
high. Monetary inflation
and a shortage of land
are only two of them.
But, in the end, it comes
down to people like your-
selves, continuing to
come onto the housing
market in massive num-
bers.
And that's really
where we started. The
problems we have out-
lined are the ones which
you are almost certain
to face sometime in the
near future.
However, it was not
our intention to depress
you. Buying a house is a
problem: it is a big one.
But problems can be
overcome, provided they
can be isolated and dealt
with properly. Which is
what this series of
articles is all about.
In our next column,
we shall deal with the
brighter side of the pic-
ture. And there is a
brighter side. People are
still managing to buy
houses within their in-
come limits. Just what
those limits are, and are
likely to be; where to
find the money; how to
bridge the gap between
the money you can bor-
row on a mortgage and
the price of the house
you want — all these
problems have answers.
Next time, we'll sug-
gest a few.
