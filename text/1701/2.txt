Letter to Lauren
F
irstly, I want
to take this
opportunity to
c o n g r a t u l a t e
everybody that grad-
uated from Imperial
in Wednesday's
Commemoration Day
undergraduate graduation
ceremony. It was some-
thing of a bittersweet
moment for me. Although
I was obviously extremly
happy to collect my
degree and finally see the
fruits of four years' worth
of hard labour, the day was
also tinged with extreme
sadness. I couldn't stop
thinking about one person
that should have been
there celebrating with us
all; my close friend and
the strongest person I
know, Lauren Dennis.
On the evening of
Monday 15th October,
I was told of Lauren's
passing after an 18-month
battle with bowel cancer
and, if I'm honest, I
haven't been able to think
of much else since. Lauren
was a Chemistry student
at Imperial. I wanted to
take this opportunity to
dedicate my editorial to
her memory with a letter
to Lauren:
Yoo Lauren, wys?
I wanted to start this
how I started every con-
versation with you. Don't
worry, I won't be sharing
any memes this time.
To be honest, I'm still at
a loss for words. There
aren't any words that can
do you justice, nor are
there words to describe
how I'm feeling right now
but it's somewhat cathartic
to put what's in my head
down on paper. It doesn't
really feel real. It was less
than two weeks ago that
we were planning how
to celebrate graduation
and you said you would
use it as "motivation to
improving fam". Even
when I came up to visit
you in hospital in Wol-
verhampton last Tuesday
after you called and let me
know the doctors had said
the cancer was terminal,
I was almost certain the
doctors had got it wrong.

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
How could someone have
the strength to keep that
beaming smile on their
face at all times? How
could someone going
through so much still
care enough to ask me
how my day was going?
Or how the next issue of
Felix was coming along?
If you were here today, I'd
probably be complaining
about the parking ticket
I got this morning while
you laughed, saying
something like, "Read the
signs Andy..."
You touched so many
lives and you will be
sorely missed by everyone
who had the pleasure
of knowing you. I will
Lauren Dennis
forever miss your infec-
tious laughter and how
you showed everyone
how to live and love.
I know you wouldn't
want us to be sad so,
although I'm heartbro-
ken, I want to end this
by thanking you. I will
forever be grateful and
blessed to have been able
to call you a friend. Thank
you for allowing me to get
close to your family and
friends, who are some of
the most amazing people
I'ver ever met. Thank you
for everything.
The world was lucky
to have you. You were the
strongest person I know
and I pray that God rests
your beautiful soul. Like
you said to me countless
times, you're my G. Love
always,
Andy
