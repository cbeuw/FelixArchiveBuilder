Birth of words
SCIENCE

A
team of linguists
and geographers
from the Centre
for Corpus
Research at the University
of Birmingham traced
the geographical roots
of emerging words in
AmericanEnglish.Among
8.9 billion words used in
980 million Tweets posted
in the US they identified
54 new words, which
were rare in October 2013
but common in November
2014.
Every time you tweet,
the app records your
precise location as well
as the posting time. This
allowed Professor Jack
Grieve and his group to
identify the birth regions
of emerging words: the
West Coast, the Northeast,
the Mid Atlantic, the Deep
South, or the Gulf Coast.
Researchers observed
some interesting patterns
of linguistic innovation.
New words tend to appear
in densely populated areas
of a particular region and
spread to similar areas
in other regions of the
country. For example, Los
Angeles and San Francis-
co are the most creative
parts of the West Coast,
from which words diffuse
to Seattle and Portland
(the Northwest) as well as
San Diego, Las Vegas and
Phoenix (the Southwest).
Although it might seem
that we can predict the
patterns of word creation
and migration by the pop-
ulation density, the Deep
South is an exception. In
this region the linguistic
innovation is mostly
driven by the culture. For
example, Atlanta, a city
much smaller than Los
Angeles or New York,
shows a lot of creative
power. Scientists attrib-
uted this effect to a large
African American pop-
ulation in the capital of
Georgia, as they observed
the quick spread of words
between areas with large
populations representing
this culture, irrespective
of their geographical
proximity.
Professor Grieve and
his team acknowledge
the main limitation of
this study: Twitter repre-
sents only one variety of
American English. New
words created for example
in science cannot be re-
flected by this analysis.
“This is the first time
that such a large sample
of emerging words or any
type of linguistic inno-
vation has been mapped
in one language”, com-
mented professor Grieve.
Modern data science and
computational tools are
changing the field of lin-
guistics, so in the future
we can expect more large
studies answering many
burning questions about
Dark cores (not a new Ben and Jerry’s™ flavour)
I
n day to day life we all
encounter people who
consistently exhibit
morally questionable
behaviour. Psychologists
describe these individuals
as possessing one or more
“dark” traits. Previous
studies have shown that
these traits relate to one
another - but do they
share a common denom-
inator … a “dark core”?
Recent research from the
University of Copenhagen
has found evidence that
this may actually be the
case!
The presence of nine
dark traits was identified
in over 2,500 participants
using questionnaires.
Analyses of these data
identified positive cor-
relations between all
nine traits, signifying a
common origin, or “dark
core”. Importantly, the
observation of any indi-
vidual trait can predict
with equal certainty the
presence of other dark
traits, an incident termed
the “indifference of the
indicator”.
The dark core is defined
as the general tendency
toward maximising one’s
own goals at the expense
of others, accompanied by
beliefs that justify these
behaviours. The dark core
can manifest in many
different forms, includ-
ing the nine dark traits.
However, the Copenhagen
study demonstrates that
these are all expressions
of the same dispositional

tendency.
The nine traits are con-
ceptually distinct, but in
practice they have many
more aspects in common
than aspects setting
them apart. Some dark
traits may seem more
acceptable than others,
for example narcissism
versus psychopathy,
but people possessing
either trait have the
same disposition to

Baeless, faved and yaas – if you use Twitter, you will have already seen some of these newly created words. But
where do they come from?
“…I know they seem a little narcissistic, but they’re actually a really good person...” – maybe not, states recent
research from the University of Copenhagen, which identifies a common denominator across many malevolent
human behaviours: a dark core.

to be correlated in a recent study by the University of

carry other malevolent
traits. The researchers
note that this finding has
important implications for
criminology, in particular
ascertaining whether an
individual will reoffend,
or even partake in more
harmful behaviour. This
research can also inform
future studies into the
cognitive patterns and
brain physiology of indi-
viduals possessing dark
traits and help identify the
risk factors and triggers
for their development.
The nine dark traits
researched in this study:
1. Egoism: motivation
to only serve one’s own
interests;
2. Machiavellianism:
callous manipulation of
others;
3. Moral disengage-
ment: belief that moral
standards do not apply to
oneself;
4. Narcissism: self-ab-
sorption, a sense of supe-
riority;
5. Psychological enti-
tlement: consistent belief
that one is entitled to more
than others;
6. Psychopathy: su-
perficial charm, lack of
empathy;
7. Sadism: deriving
pleasure from inflicting
pain;
8 . S e l f - i n t e r e s t :
ambition to better one’s
status, without regards for
others;
9. Spitefulness: mali-
ciousness even at personal
expense.
