Imperial
The 47th Vice-President of the United States delivers inaugural cancer research lecture at Imperial
J
oe Biden, the US
Vice President
during Barack
Obama’s admin-
istration, paid Imperial
a visit on 9th October
to deliver the inaugural
lecture of the Imperial
Cancer Research UK
(CRUK) Centre.
Vice President Biden
spoke of the “urgency of
now” as cancer research
realises a radical, highly
collaborative and pro-
gressive step-change,
surpassing that of the Nix-
on-era “war on cancer”.
The lecture was hosted
by Professor the Lord
Darzi of Denham, the
Imperial CRUK Centre’s
Director and director of
Imperial’s Institute of
Global Health Innovation,
and Alice Gast, President
of Imperial College
London. Vice President
Biden met President Gast
and Lord Darzi to discuss
Imperial's new cancer
centre, explaining that the
initiative was “changing
the way we do business in
cancer research and care”
report [Review of Health
and Care].”
Encouragingly, Vice
President Biden said that
we’ve begun to “make
real progress” in the fight
against cancer, saying: “I
can see the day where pre-
vention is more effective,
when care is personalised
and side effects are less
harmful. When children
are vaccinated against
cancer. When we can
identify through markers
in the blood cancers that
haven’t developed yet.
When we can identify
early signals of cancer in
the blood through frag-
ments shred from cancer
cells. There is hope.”
President Gast spoke of
the discoveries Imperial is
making that will change
outcomes for cancer
patients. Thanking Vice
President Biden for his
lecture, Imperial’s Presi-
dent Alice Gast said: “You
have helped us today to
launch a landmark collab-
oration between Imperial,
the Institute of Cancer
Research and Cancer
Research UK. Everyone
here is united in their
determination to win the
battle against cancer.”
Vice President Biden
also detailed how the
Biden Cancer Initiative,
established in 2017, is
building on the work of the
Obama Administration’s
Cancer Moonshot that
raised billions of dollars to
rapidly accelerate cancer
research. The Bidens’ son
Beau, a decorated Iraq
war veteran and attorney
general of Delaware,
died in May 2015, aged
46, after being diagnosed
with a brain tumour. Lord
Darzi welcomed the Vice
team. We can make hope
real. As President Obama
once said – yes we can.”
The Imperial CRUK
Centre is a research col-
laboration between Impe-
rial College London, Im-
perial College Healthcare
NHS Trust and Cancer
Research UK that brings
together scientists, clini-
cians, engineers and phys-
icists in the fight against
cancer. The Centre, which
brings together interdisci-
plinary experts, has two
key themes: reducing
the burden of cancer and
increasing the precision of
cancer treatments.
After his talk, Vice President Biden stopped to take a selfie with Imperial students // Owen Billcliffe
and had helped foster new
collaborations with coun-
tries all over the world.
The former Vice Pres-
ident urged scientists to
collaborate in ways that
haven’t existed before,
calling for data to be made
more widely accessible
and for the creation of a
cancer research and care
system that the public
deserves. He then went on
to compliment Imperial’s
“impressive” work in
the fight against cancer,
saying: “I’ve never seen
folks as bright and who
work as hard as all of you.
You are the most talented
community in the world”.
Vice President Biden
warnedthat,by2025,there
will be almost 20 million
new cancer cases and 11.4
million deaths around
the world every year. He
added: “We need to use
all the expertise we have
working together to take
down this disease”. Biden
also added: “We cannot
accept disparities of
outcomes by race, gender
and geography. We cannot
accept unaffordable treat-
ments. We cannot accept
failing to adopt policy to
address risk factors such
as obesity, smoking and
alcohol consumption, as

GB Week

Imperial College London played host to a number of different events and activities for different audiences during the first Green GB week

T
his past week
saw Imperial
play an active
role in the first
Green GB Week.
Green GB Week is a
weekofeventsandactivity
bringing together busi-
nesses, schools, colleges,
universities, community
groups, and charities to
explore how clean growth
will change our futures
and others can contribute
to action on climate
change. Spearheaded by
the Rt Hon Claire Perry
MP, Minister of State
for Energy and Clean
Growth, the government
initiative is led by the
Department for Business,
Energy and Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) and aims
to highlight the successes
and opportunities of clean,
low-carbon business and
enterprise in Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.
In his speech to the
Green GB Week Clean
Energy Innovation
Summit at County
Hall, Sam Gyimah, the
Science Minister, said
the following: “The UK
may be home to some of
the brightest minds in the
world, but it doesn’t have
a monopoly on great ideas.
Nor is climate change a
solely British concern.
So we’re working with
friends around the world
to ensure that innovative
approaches can flourish in
every corner of the globe.
In this Green GB Week…
it’s your turn to take that
idea you’ve always kept at
the back of your head and
start bringing it into the
real world.”
Imperial hosted three
events as part of Green
GB Week, including the
launch event on Monday
15th October. This event,
the European Launch of
the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC)’s Special Report
on 1.5°C, included short
speeches from the IPCC
Chair and leading authors
on the key findings of the
report, as well as a session
on its implications for
business and the interna-
tional community. This
was followed by a discus-
sion on how to avoid the
worst effects of climate
change. Divest Imperial,
an Imperial College
Union-affiliated environ-
mental campaign group,
has described Imperial’s
involvement in Green GB
week as an “eye watering
display of hypocrisy” and
gave Felix the following
statement:
“The IPCC 1.5 report
being launched today on
our campus urges deep
and rapid cuts to carbon
emissions in order to
avert devastating human
and ecological impacts
of climate breakdown.
Oil companies’ business
plans send us way past
this threshold. We urge
Imperial College and
the UK government to
heed this call to action
and stop enabling fossil
fuel industry expansion.
Imperial’s ties to the fossil
fuel industry pervade
every aspect of campus
life. Companies like
BP and Shell are given
unprecedented access
to students through
careers, compulsory
course modules, talks and
awards. Research partner-
ships help companies such
as Saudi Aramco, Shell
and Qatar Petroleum drill
ever deeper. Management
refuse to divest Imperial’s
roughly £9m holdings
in fossil fuel companies,
and our President is on
the board of directors of
an oil major. We will no
longer accept the com-
plicity of our university
in climate breakdown. We
are calling for Imperial to
fulfill its stated purpose
- working to solve human-
ity’s greatest challenges.
This means an end to
its uncritical support for
climate-wrecking com-
panies, starting with full
divestment of its £8.8m
fossil fuel holdings.”
Other events hosted
by Imperial included a
Breakfast Seminar on
Business and the Envi-
ronment, jointly hosted
by the Grantham Institute,
ImperialCollegeLondon's
hub for climate change
and the environment, and
John Lewis & Partners on
Wednesday 17th October.
The Grantham Institute
also hosted an exhibit at
the Westminster offices of
BEIS.
Thursday 18th October
saw Imperial, the
Grantham Institute and
Climate-KIC, the EU’s
main climate innovation
initiative, jointly host the
“Greenovate” showcase,
showing how innovation
and new ideas could
help address the major
environmental issues we
face on both global and
local scales. Finally, the
Grantham Institute hosted
an open discussion on
London’s air crisis and
how we can bring about
change.

Lord Darzi said: “You

movingly about the tragic
loss of your son Beau.
Your personal story has
