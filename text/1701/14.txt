Mutation as a form as music
Tim Hecker warns of an apocalyptic dawn with transcendental acceptance.
R
ules are suf-
focating, their
mere existence
a constraint,
bound by our own mach-
inations. To create is to
liberate. To break rules is
to break free. Bach should
be terrified of Ornette
Coleman, and I’d reckon
Chaplin would be dizzy
after a Harmony Korine
film.
Ambient music exists
at the very end of the
spectrum, and by defini-
tion alone, it is fiercely
post-modern and non-mu-
sical in every traditional
sense. Coined by Brian
Eno, it disposes of struc-
ture and composition in
favour of features it deems
more important, such as
texture and atmosphere.
Bizarrely, such an obtuse
form of music would
become near ubiquitous
as it got relegated to the
function of background
music. It’s mood music,
something to relax to. It’s
soft and simple.
You wouldn’t hear
Tim Hecker playing at
an airport or the dentist.
Hecker eschews the
idioms of ambient music
which easily cast it, by
the disinterested listener,
as muzak. Throughout
his career, spanning
various albums and styles,
Hecker’s brand of ambient
music is loud and pur-
poseful, strictly requiring
your attention. His music
is amorphous, almost as
if it were the mutation of
sound as music. Perhaps
it is even lazy to charac-
terise his brand of music
as “ambient”. Hecker’s
output, as he states, is an
extension of his “obses-
sion with ether and things
that aren’t fully formed”,
and is “fog-based”,
almost embodying a life
of its own. His albums
are entirely encapsulated,
almost as if it is one song,
as he conjures abstract
soundscapes with what
seems like an endless
palette of sonic textures.
With the seminal
Ravedeath, 1972, we saw
Hecker incorporate more
live music into his compo-
sitions.Among the distort-
ed drones and aggressive
synthesisers, we occa-
sionally caught glimpses
of a piano - though dis-
figured and mutated. Each
release thereafter would
seek to feature more
instrumentation and live
recordings, with Virgins
“A dramatic
departure
from the
sound that
dominated
the majority
of his previous
output”
being centred around
haunting piano phrases
and Love Streams manip-
ulating choral samples.
Konoyo takes this one
step further, stepping into
electro-acoustic territory,
with its music heavily
influenced by Gagaku, the
imperial court music of
Japan that had its heyday
in the Heian Period, in the
9th Century.
Konoyo’s stylistic
origins are traceable to the
late Jóhann Jóhannsson,
as Hecker revealed in an
interview with The Japan
Times. During his record-
ing sessions with Jóhanns-
son, who provided choral
arrangements for Love
Streams, the composer in-
troduced him to the music
of Gagaku. With this
album Hecker sought to
subvert the “super-dense,
kind of effect-laden”
sound he had put forth in
albums prior, and explore
notions of negative space,
as inspired by the ancient
Japanese art form. “There
was so much restraint in
the music of Gagaku, and
just this kind of power.”
Konoyo sees Hecker
working with the improvi-
sational compositions
of a group of Gagaku
musicians. Recorded in a
temple in Tokyo, his latest
album is a dramatic depar-
ture from the sound that
dominated the majority
of his previous output. On
Konoyo we are equally
privy to passages of
live instrumentation and
synthesised distortions.
The Canadian musician’s
new-found compositional
language is profound
and abstract, as he pieces
together a collage of
sharp, glassy synthesisers
with ominous ceremonial
instrumentation, narrating
a disorienting, dissonant
rendition of the apoca-
lypse. The soundscapes
swirl patiently while
gliding synthesisers
wail. For Hecker, the
world does not end in a
blinding blaze of heat. It
is however, cold, and we
suffer slowly, and accept-
ingly.
An impressionist mas-
terpiece, Konoyo stands
tall amongst the rest of
the year’s music. Hecker
pulls more from the post-
rock cookbook than ever
before and presents one of
his most thought provok-
ing and complete works
to date. Konoyo is futur-
istic while nostalgic, it is
hopeful yet despondent,
foreboding yet majestic.
Here, he perfects what he
ultimately failed to do in
Love Streams. The music
on Konoyo wails painful-
ly, but I’m not quite sure
what Hecker is trying to
tell us. Perhaps that we are
slowly crumbling away,
day after day. I think he’s
right.
