E
de & Raven-
scroft, the
c o m p a n y
which provides
graduation gowns for
Imperial’s (and other
universities’) annual
graduation ceremonies,
has been accused of
driving the cost of gown
rental up through “an-
ti-competitive” business
practices.
In the week that saw
more than 2500 under-
graduate students collect
their degrees from Imperi-
al College London in the
university’s annual Com-
memoration Day ceremo-
ny, Felix reports that Ede
& Ravenscroft has been
accused of holding an
alleged “near monopoly”
over the gown market. As
first reported in national
newspapers including the
Telegraph and Daily Mail,
Ede & Ravenscroft was
the subject of a complaint
for allegedly “eliminat-
ing” and “deterring” com-
petition by entering into
exclusive contracts with
109 universities across
the country. Contracted
universities, such as Im-
perial, insist that students
must wear the "official
supplier's" garments.
The universities are paid
commission, in some
cases 20 per cent per robe,
allowing them to accrue
thousands of pounds from
the arrangements.
Students are essentially
being denied choice of
robe supplier by their
universities and are,
subsequently, unaware of
incentives and missing out
on cheaper suppliers. One
such supplier, Churchill
Gowns, gave Felix the fol-
lowing statement: “We are
selling directly to students
and cutting out the middle
man (the University) who
needlessly take a cut out
of the students pockets.
Now that students are
spending upwards of 30k
to graduate many feel it
unethical and needlessly
rapacious of any uni-
versity to squeeze more
money in the form of back
hand payments from robe
makers. Ultimately we are
trying to offer students
choice.” Churchill Gowns
claim to be “disrupting the
industry” by offering stu-
dents gowns made from
“100% recycled plastic
bottles which are not only
more ethically made but
much more affordable”.
Ede & Ravenscroft
gowns range from
£45-£50 to hire, while
students can be charged
between £30-£150 for
photographs. Oxford and
Cambridge are believed
to be the only universities
in the country which have
arrangements in place
with multiple suppliers.
Two Oxford Universi-
ty-accredited retailers
charge just £9.99 for
undergraduate robes and
£7.99 for a mortarboard.
Ede & Ravenscroft instead
insist that students hire
a full package of gown,
hood and cap meaning
that cheaper substitues for
some elements cannot be
used.
The alleged lack of
free market composition
has led to students paying
over the odds to rent
their graduation gown
and, as a result, large
numbers of students can’t
afford to attend their own
graduation ceremony.
Robert Halfon, chair of
the Commons education
select committee, labelled
the claims 'deeply con-
cerning'.
A spokesman for Ede
and Ravenscroft said that
it operated in a “compet-
itive market” and denied
claims that its success
was due to students being
“obliged to do business
with us”. He continued to
say students can choose
to hire their gowns from
whichever supplier they
wanted to and added
the firm won contracts
because of their 'compet-
itive pricing'.
They also said man-
ufacturing gowns for a
single university can cost
more than £250,000.
