War at the world
The recently released report on global warming by the IPCC does not include good news. If we
want to keep our planet and live long lives, we must ensure that the system changes.

does half
a degree
make? It doesn’t seem like
much, right? After all, you
don’t notice if the water in
your sink has gone from
35 ºC to 35.5 ºC when you
are washing the dishes.
But half a degree is much
more important than what
you may think. It is the
difference between being
able to save 25% of coral
reefs or none at all. The
fate of millions of people
in the most vulnerable and
poor regions of the world
rely on half a degree. And
we are now surer than
ever.
1.5 ºC in the global mean
temperature compared to
pre-industrial levels, and
the feasibility of limiting
the increase to ‘just’ that
value. The report also
included as a terrifying
reference the theorized
implications of the tem-
perature increasing half a
degree more, to 2 ºC.
What are the main
differences between the
two? Well, 1.5 ºC will be
bad, but is pretty much in-
evitable at this point. 2 ºC,
which isn’t, would be cat-
astrophic. For starters, we
can look at the probability
of extreme weather events
(i.e. droughts or torrential
rains) occurring under the
two temperatures. While
the exact figure could not
be calculated, scientists
know with high confi-
dence that such events
would be much more
frequent if the world heats
up to the higher tempera-
ture. In more quantifiable
aspects of nature, it was
also reported that sea
level, while still above
present level, would be 10
cm lower under a 1.5 ºC
warming compared to a 2
ºC warming. This would
be quite a difference for
the numerous inhabitants
of many coastal com-
munities, the difference
between staying in their
ancestral lands or being
forced to flee.
So, after understanding
the implications of all
this, what can humankind
do to avoid reaching the
feared 2 ºC warm? Well,
we would have to change
our entire production
model, our lifestyle and
our consumption choices,
in addition to embarking
in profound changes to
our infrastructure, all in
the span of less than 15
years. The report conclud-
ed that for the increase to
be stabilized around the
1.5 ºC value, CO2 emis-
sions will have to be cut
to 55% of what they were
in 2010 (!), transitioning
into a gradual phase out
that eliminates emission
altogether by the time we
reach the equator of the
millennium. If these plans
are not carried out, it will
be impossible to stop at
1.5 ºC without engaging
in colossal projects of
geoengineering, like solar
radiation managements,
whose potential side
effects are not yet well
understood. that our generation does
not resign to the fate of
a ruined planet, where
many species and ecosys-
tems have been wiped out
and hundreds of millions
of people have become
victims of global warming
or the conflicts provoked
by it. What can you do?
Well, the most important
thing to remember is
that individual action,
while important, won’t
be enough to stop climate
change. So yes, it will
help if you decrease your
consumption of meat
(specially beef) and you
avoid using private cars or
planes. But you have to do
a lot more for it to make
a difference. You have to
put pressure on your poli-
ticians, especially in these
days as climate change
denialism has become
the standard position of
governments of countries
of the magnitude of the
USA. You have to demand
that further regulations
are applied to companies,
as 70% of all global emis-
sions are caused by them.
You have to engage with
your friends, and family,
and the wider members
of society, and convince
them of threat that climate
change poses to all of that.
The transformation that
we will have to make in
our lifetimes cannot and
must not be curbed by the
actions of a few greedy
individuals. Because
remember, the world is at
war, and our enemies are
presently in power.

Last week, the Inter-
governmental Panel on
Climate Change (an UN
affiliated organism that
monitors climate change
and its potential effects
on all aspects of human
society) released a report
on the potential conse-
quences that an increase of

Scary, isn’t it? The
changes that will have
to be carried out if we
choose the less bad
scenario would be of
tremendous magnitude,
to the points that it looks
very unlikely that the
most industrialised econ-
omies in the world (led by
the USA and China) will
be able to comply, without
even factoring their will-
ingness to do so. To add
to the pile of terrifying
news, the IPCC report
didn’t look at the effects
that tipping point factors
would have in the whole
process. These include the
positive carbon feedback
as the retreating Arctic
ice releases millions of
tonnes of methane to the
atmosphere, or the melting
of Siberian permafrost.
Some studies suggest that
we may already be too late
to avoid that, which would
lead to an outcome where
a 2 ºC increase would be
the optimistic scenario.
But one cannot lose
hope. It is very important
