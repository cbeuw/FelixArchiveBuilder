Go Watch The Wife, If Only for Glenn Close
T
he Wife, directed
by Björn Runge
and starring
Glenn Close and
Jonathan Pryce, is a story
about Joan Archer, the
wife of Nobel Prize in
Literature recipient Joseph
Castleman (Jonathan
Pryce). Glenn Close, as
the eponymous “Wife”
proves to be the most
stunning and transcendent
feature of the film.
As opposed to Frances
McDormand’s explosive
performance last year
which won her an Oscar,
Glenn Close in The Wife
portrays a collected and
internal character. Joan
Archer has a very con-
flicting personality. She is
regularly shunned aside as
“the wife”, both publicly
and domestically. “I am
a kingmaker,” she says
without hesitation. She
never doubted her own
ability and she knows that
her husband will never
have a career without her,
and she wants to be recog-
nised for that (“Everyone
needs approval,” she tells
her husband). However,
at the same time, her love
and respect for her spouse
becomes an obstacle for
her. When Nathaniel
Bone (Christian Slater),
the journalist who keeps
trying to persuade Joan
to let him write about her
husband’s fraudulence,
she firmly forbids him.
This may be testament to
her unwavering respect
for her husband’s legacy,
or she simply does not
want to be in the spotlight.
In any case, she struggles
to gain the approval she
does not know she needed
until her husband gets a
Nobel Prize. Glenn Close
delivers this dissonance
of emotion very clearly
through a calm facade.
And that’s the brilliance
of her performance,
because despite all the
suppressed emotions, the
audience never fails to un-
derstand her. Her presence
is like waves which grow
in magnitude as the film
progresses until it builds
up into a tsunami and all
the suppressed energy is
released volcanically in an
emotional and absolutely
enthralling finale.
That is not to under-
mine the rest of the cast
and crew. Jonathan Pryce
is great as the narcissis-
tic husband, and Max
Irons, who plays the son
of Joseph Castleman,
portraying an aspiring
writer with desperate need
of a father’s approval
with quite some shining
moments. Together, the
entire cast’s performances
create a very engaging
chemistry which suc-
cessfully carries the film
through its slower and
more dragging parts.
In terms of the direc-
tion, for me, the camera
is mostly a relatively
passive and conservative
presence, which in my
opinion augments the per-
formances and captivation
of the film. Especially
at times when the story
seems to wander a bit,
putting Glenn Close at the
dead centre of the frame
is a very correct choice.
Because her dedication to
the character and metic-
ulous performance alone
is enough to provide the
film a burst of momentum
for it to hit its final high
mark.
Masters of the Melancholic Movie Music
A
month ago, in
the throes of
feeling ill and
in the dumps, I
turned not to Netflix but
my old DVD collection.
After wiping away the
dust and sifting through
the selection, I found,
tightly tucked at the back
of the drawer, a bunch of
DVDs all created by the
most celebrated Japanese
animation studio.
At some point in your
life I’m certain you
will have seen or heard
about a Studio Ghibli
movie, most likely
Spirited Away or Howl’s
Moving Castle. They are
incredibly well-crafted
stories with exceptionally
beautiful visuals and
characters you’re imme-
diately invested in. I still
remember being dragged
along to a showing of
Spirited Away by my dad
and becoming hooked.
I pop in the first DVD,
the title comes up and it
hits me like a train. That
melancholic feeling in my
chest warms just from the
music in the title screen.
As the movie goes on I
realise that despite it being
years since I’ve seen it,
the music is still burned
into my memory. At one
point I even muted the TV
just be sure, the moment
the music left the feeling
did too.
The mastermind behind
the studio’s scores is
Joe Hisaishi. He’s had
a lifetime of awards for
composition and musical
influence, including
winning the Japanese
Academy Award for Best
Music seven times.
The beauty of Hisai-
shi’s scores stems from
the motifs he crafts and
their constant appearance
at just the right moments.
The motifs always
manage to perfectly match
the theme of the story and
change in their intensity
and tone as the characters
go on their journey.
If it’s a story about a
woman breaking past the
exceptions society has of
her, then the score is a
waltz – perfectly repre-
senting the dance she is
stuck in where she does
not lead. Then in her most
powerful moments the
score swells with a full or-
chestra behind it demon-
strating her newly found
strength. Or a story about
a boy having to triumph
over an evil he doesn’t
understand. Start with
the motif being dark and
sinister and as the movie
progresses have it become
light and triumphant.
I’ve specifically not
mentioned any names of
the films I’ve seen because
they are all exceptional.
This is just my opinion
so I encourage you to go
watch one for yourself,
and you may even feel
melancholic despite never
having seen one before
(true review from my
mate Liam).
I watched all the
movies I had on DVD
and by the end, the warm
melancholic feeling was
almost like a burning. So
much emotion is packed
into so few melodies and
themes. The simplicity
and power is exactly
why over a decade from
my first viewings I still
remembered every last
note, and I’m sure that
another decade from now,
I still will.
