I’m Not Running runs out of steam
P
auline Gibson is
a young doctor,
having served in
a small provincial
hospital for most of her
career. When the authori-
ties threaten to close down
the hospital in order to
concentrate resources and
services, she finds herself
campaigning against
its closure, becoming
something of a national
celebrity in the process.
She succeeds, the hospital
is saved, and now as an
angel of the NHS, Pauline
finds a political career
before her, first becoming
an independent MP and
then considers running for
Labour leadership.
This, however, is
complicated by Paul-
ine’s relationship with
an old boyfriend from
university, Jack Gould,
who has worked his way
to material comfort as a
lawyer, become an MP,
and is now also eyeing
the Labour leadership.
Their divergent paths
and on-and-off fraught
relationship is the vehicle
for many an exposition
about the issues raised in
the play.
I’m Not Running is
David Hare’s 17th new
play for the National
Theatre, a thinly-veiled
parallel universe that
comments on and some-
times satirizes the current
state of British politics.
With wide-ranging issues
such as the state of the
NHS, single-issue politics,
the Labour party, domestic
abuse and feminism all
jostling for attention in the
play, watching it felt like
a quick browse through
today’s newspaper.
The downside of ad-
dressing so many issues
in two and a half hours
is that inevitably, each
issue is not explored
sufficiently. For a play
that is so overtly political
and puts a touchy political
subject – the direction of
the NHS – at its centre, it
is disappointingly shallow
in its portrayal of these
issues and is one-dimen-
sional in its commentary.
It is happily assumed that
saving a small provincial
hospital with limited
resources is the right thing
to do, when there are, in
fact, many good reasons
to concentrate specialist
resources in healthcare.
These were hardly men-
tioned in the argument
between Jack and Pauline,
where Jack raises only
simplistic economical
reasons for his support of
the hospital closures.
Other issues were only
touch and go, which made
the play feel like it lacked
direction and was trying
to take on too many things
at once. It is hinted that
there was some violence
in Jack and Pauline’s re-
lationship back in univer-
sity, and some domestic
abuse between Pauline’s
parents. Meredith, a polit-
ically-conscious aspiring
journalist, has an extended
conversation with Pauline
about female genital
mutilation. These are
important issues, which
means that throwing them
in without further explo-
ration seemed cursory,
and detracted from the
focus and momentum of
the play.
What the play did have
going for it, however,
was the characterisation
of Jack and Pauline’s re-
lationship, and their indi-
vidual characters. One of
the earlier scenes, of when
the two were arguing in
a university dormitory
room, was perhaps one of
the more sensitive ones in
the play. We get a sense of
how emotionally guarded
Pauline is, her difficult
relationship with her alco-
holic mother, and Jack’s
tendency towards control.
As their paths diverged,
we see Pauline standing
for her principles, head-
strong and stubborn, while
Jack strives for material
comfort and an outward
display of stability and
‘perfection’. “I love my
wife very much and she
is perfect,” he declares,
right after sleeping with
Pauline while his wife
was away.
Sian Brooke does a
good job as Pauline,
bringing out her transfor-
mation from idealistic uni-
versity student to realising
that in order to change
the world, she has to
step into partisan politics
herself. Alex Hassell is
slightly affected as Jack,
but Joshua McGuire puts
on a strong performance
as Sandy, Pauline’s loyal
press secretary and the
only easily likeable char-
acter in the play.
It seems to me that
the concrete issues of the
play and the interpersonal
relationships portrayed
are two distinct matters –
it does well painting the
characters but falls short
in exploring the issues
they are embroiled in with
any insight. The character
development, which is
fairly well done, fails to
integrate itself seamlessly
into the political commen-
tary, which is a shame.
Therearealsosomescenes
that are curiously improb-
able, such as Meredith
suddenly having a heart
attack mid-conversation
with Pauline due to a
congenital heart condition
that no one knew about
before. She dies, which is
also curious considering
someone of her young
age, right next to a qual-
ified doctor, should be the
exact kind of candidate
for successful CPR.
I’m Not Running is a
play that tries to do too
much all at once. While
the cast is strong and the
characters relatable, its
skirting over a wide range
of political issues does it
no favours. The result is
a structure that has too
many weakly-related
components for its own
good, lacking momentum
and focus.
I’m Not Running will
be broadcast by National
Theatre Live on 31
January 2019.
