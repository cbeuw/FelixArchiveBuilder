Your hours are numbered – Emit style!
B
e honest with
me - how
many times
did you pull an
all-nighter last year? How
many times did you start
an assignment at the last
minute, this questionable
decision justified by
saying that “diamonds are
made under pressure”?
We are three weeks into
college and some of us
have already found that
sticking to the promise
of being up-to-date with
all our work is harder
to do than to vow.
Urgency is what we best
respond to, thanks to the
ingrained ‘fight or flight’
response. When we look
at our watch/smartphone,
our perception of the
amount of time we have
can differ greatly from
reality. Two MechEng
graduates - Stephen Titus
and Thushaan Rajaratnam
- from our university have
not only acknowledged
this problem, but have
created their solution
- Emit.
What is it?
Emit is a new line of
smartwatches that counts
down the time to a certain
event, instead of showing
it as an absolute value,
in the hopes that people
would improve their
perception of the value of
time.
“Our mission is to help
people accomplish their
most important goals and
dreams by proactively
allocating appropriate
amounts of time to each
of them.”
Some people might
argue that timers on
smartphones can be used
instead of this. While
smartphones are un-
doubtedly useful for brief
tasks, they are ultimately
distracting when used for
long periods of time. If
you were to keep track of
time through your phone,
you would be subjected
to the constant traffic
of information through
Whatsapp, Snapchat,
Gmail, Facebook, In-
stagram, Twitter, etc.
According to the founders
of Emit, the best way to
prioritize goals to have
a “clear and focused
mindset” is to keep plans
and execution simple.
This way, you “won’t let
time fly away before it’s
too late”. Emit succeeds
in this by simply showing
multiple countdowns
programmed into it by the
user without the distrac-
tion of apps.
I n s p i r a t i o n
behind Emit
According to the
founders, initially, they
had joked about creating
a “deathwatch” that
would count down to your
death. Later, after more
serious consideration,
they thought that playing
with the psychology of
scarcity could make users
appreciate the “value and
irreversibility” of time.
They started work on
building the watch this
January.
Features
Emit has many differ-
ent features that can help
you make a day be more
productive. They are:
Day/night cycle - this
shows the countdown
to the start and end of
the day. You can switch
effortlessly to see another
countdown by tapping on
the screen.
Multiple times - you
can create multiple timers
to take into account events
like breaks, meetings, ex-
ercises, lectures, etc.
Phone sync - Auto-
matic Bluetooth syncing
of selected events on your
phone with emit. This
works with many calen-
ders (for instance, google
and microsoft) and is
compatible with iOS and
Android.
Specifications
So, before you buy the
watch, what are the basic
specifications you need to
know? The color of the
watch is black and weighs
roughly sixty grams with
a multi-touch screen.
Next Steps
Emit is going live on
Kickstarter, the world’s
largest funding platform
for creative projects,
on Monday the 22nd
of
October. The Kickstarter
tiers are aggressively
priced at $99, $119 and
$139, depending on how
early in the campaign you
get them. Can this watch
really end procrastina-
tion? Time will tell.
