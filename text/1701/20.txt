Low-fat, reduced fat and fat-free foods: a
healthy choice or a myth?
Replacing everything in your fridge with low-fat alternatives? You may want
to think twice...
H
ey, could you
please grab a
Greek yoghurt
when you’re in
Tesco? Just make sure it’s
the low-fat one - thanks!”
Sound familiar?
Nowadays, we’re con-
stantly surrounded by a
myriad of fat-free, low-fat
and reduced fat products
as the food industry’s
attempt to maximise
profits gains momentum –
taking a toll on our health.
But why? Weren’t we
taught that the less fat you
eat, the more weight you
lose, while reducing satu-
rated fat improves cardio-
vascular health? In theory,
kind of. In practice, with
all the emerging products
on the market promising
a ‘healthier lifestyle’,
this turns out to be more
of a misconception than
something to preach.
The first problem is the
difference between the
types of labels (who am
I kidding, does anyone
care about wording when
you want whipped cream?
Anyway, read on to find
out).
• ‘Reduced fat’ foods -
25% less fat than the
regular counterpart
• ‘Low-fat’ – less than
3g of fat per serving
• ‘Fat-free’ – less than
0.5g fat per serving
Labelling can hence
be extremely misleading
– take cream cheese, for
example. A reduced fat
one still contains more
than 3% of fat (and thus
a high fat food), but we
buy it, thinking it’s a lean
choice.
Next: what do these
modified foods really
contain? Since the fat
content is limited, they
must be prepared differ-
ently than the original.
A common technique is
replacing animal fats with
unsaturated vegetable
oils; sounds healthy, right?
However, their structure
is often altered in order
for their properties to suit
the product’s purpose, in a
process called hydrogena-
tion.
This greatly increases
the levels of trans-fats:
the unhealthiest kind due
to their artificial nature
and lack of potential to be
utilised in the body.
You may be wondering
why modified products
still taste good – after all,
flavour is eliminated.
Well, to keep the food
edible, sugar levels are
amped up like crazy in
reduced fat products.
This results in not only
a potentially higher
calorific content, but also
in elevated blood sugar
levels and subsequent
risk of type II diabetes or
cardiovascular disease.
Various additives and
chemicals may also be
incorporated. So much for
‘healthy eating’.
The simplest argument
for avoiding these
products is that fats
(despite all those Daily
Mail rumours), are
actually good and neces-
sary, as long as they’re the
right type.
Healthy fats provide
essential fatty acids such
as omega-3 or -6, which
are used for making cell
membranes, hormones,
neurons in the brain and
central nervous system,
and more. Ingestion of
these is vital because
the human body cannot
synthesise these itself, so
if you’re trying to lose
weight this way, you’re
losing your mind. Liter-
ally.
The conclusion? Read
the label before you buy
modified fat options to see
what it is being replaced
by, and decide whether
it’s worth it. Hint: if you
can’t be bothered or don’t
understand half the ingre-
dients, it might be easier
to just stay away from
