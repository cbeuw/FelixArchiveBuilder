I
mperial is sponsor-
ing ChainGang, a
“hackathon” dedi-
cated to producing
new cryptocurrency
technology, in Shored-
itch this November. For
the inside scoop, I talked
to two representatives
from disruptive cryp-
to-startup EthCoinLite,
Dick Fistula and Randy
Stooge, about their rad-
ical ideas for the future
of currency.
“Our beginnings were
humble,” says Fistula.
“I’m a self-made man.
Grew all my own peyote.
Sold it door-to-door,
walking six miles from
the farm to John McAfee’s
house with no shoes and a
big sack full of mescaline.
Soon, the operation ex-
panded - I hired a police
force, bought some child
slaves (any wage the
market decides is fair),
kicked back, and began
living the Ayn Randian
dream. Now, not even
the local police force can
touch me - I paid them
off too!” Fistula exuber-
antly gestures, and in the
process, seven half-full
bags of cocaine fall out
of his pocket. He scoops
them up quickly, glances
furtively, and quickly
inhales two of them. “My
life fucking rules. I’m
John Belushi!”
Stooge concurs. “Cryp-
tocurrency promises to
really disrupt the way we
live our lives. At first we
thought it was mundane
- ok, cool, you can buy
drugs on the internet. But
that doesn’t really serve
the people with means -
they have people to buy
drugs for them. What we
need is radical. Money
laundering, hiding taxable
funds from governments,
paying off hitmen,
breaking the mould. Now
that’s disruptive free en-
terprise.”
I interjected: “But what
about all the computing
power that’s been com-
mitted to finding nonce
values in SHA sums?
Surely that could be used
to model climate change,
or fold proteins, or some-
thing.”
in negation. “Protein
folding is all well and
good, but it doesn’t really
fold my protein, if you get
what I’m saying. Only me,
my seven sister-wives,
and my rotating stock of
concubines can do that.
You wanna talk nonces,
come ‘round the farm
sometime.”
Suddenly, Fistula’s
phone rings. He answers,
and grows pale. He blus-
ters off in a hurry - “Sorry,
gotta run, my child slaves
are revolting, and I don’t
have any rebellion insur-
ance!”
Wanting to know more
about their anarcho-capi-
talist worldview, I spoke
with Laszlo Polis, a reader
in political science at-
large in the University of
London system.

“Ugh, listen - we’re all
monkeys who stuck our
thumbs up our assholes
and thought about what
it meant to be human.
We’re mammals on a rock
a hundred million miles
away from an uncon-
strained nuclear reaction
smack-dab in the middle
of a vast cosmic void. Did
you really expect them of
all people to figure it out?”
I demurred, and he
noticed my hesitation.
“Besides, these crypto
chucklefucks aren’t really
that different from the
empowered few in the
status quo - just a lot more
hedonistic. Forgive them,
for they know not what
they do.”
God help us all.
“Besides,
these crypto
chucklefucks
aren’t really
that different
from the
empowered
few in the
status quo ”
Fistula shook his head

£60,000 for a

London’s annual Com-
memoration Day un-
dergraduate graduation
ceremony. More than
2500 undergraduate stu-
dents strode across the
Royal Albert Hall stage
to collect their degrees
and take the first step
into the murky world
of graduate unemploy-
ment. Congratulations
from Negafelix!
Wednesdayalsomarked
the day that you plucky
band of fresh graduates
realised that Imperial just
managed to charge you
£60,000 for a handshake
with President Alice Gast
and her sideman. Was it
worth it? Congratulations
on keeping the handshake
with the President brief
enough that you managed
to leave with your hand
intact. It would be a real
shame if it were to freeze
while in contact with the
ice queen).
Wednesdayalsomarked
the day Imperial College
Union set a new October
graduation revenue
record of £30,147.10, a
19.98% increase on the
previous record, 2017’s
£25,481.39. If the £60,000
scam of a university edu-
cation weren’t enough, at
least Imperial was able to
squeeze the last penny out
of you before you left this
place for good. Congratu-
lations again! You all have
the brightest of futures
ahead of you...
President Alice Gast // Imperial College London
So... you graduated... congratulations and welcome to
the world of graduate unemployment!
This week, with the
College launching its
Equality, Diversity and
Inclusion Strategy, you’re
happy something is being
done to make the rich
people like you feel like
you belong.
This week you’re the Bar
Manager at the Union:
you didn’t seem to think
people would celebrate
leaving Imperial that
much.
No more cups? Just give
them conical flasks.
This week, you’re a
disgruntled PhD student.
Tired of undocumented
undergrads coming into
h-bar, you believe it’s
time for h-bar to leave
the Union. Referendum
anyone?
This week you’re Alice
Gast. To your surprise
you can finally relate
to the average Imperial
student. Why do you
even have to come in?
Graduation is recorded.
This week, you’re Deputy
President (Finance &
Services). No one ever
appreciates your work.
Pissed, you poke holes in
all the cups in the Union.
Let them drink Bud
Light.
This week you discover
you’re prone to
sleepwalking. You wake
up in the library café at 3
AM trying to get a packet
of McCoy’s out of the
vending machine.
Muscle memory?
This week you get
ready to turn up at the
graduation afterparty.
For some reason, you
forgot everyone here still
went to Imperial. Not
so much turn up as turn
around where possible.
This week, as you walk
across the graduation
stage to shake hands with
your Dean, you trip and
fall flat on your face.
Well, at least you went
out with a bang.
Or a thud.
This week your funding
runs out. Desperate
for money you end up
applying for one of
those dodgy clinical
trials advertised in the
SAF toilets. Who needs
olfaction anyway?
This week, you drink
after graduation - not in
celebration, but regret.
Who begged you to work
hard for a first? Should’ve
been doing case practice.
This week, for the first
time in your 3 years here,
both library doors are
open. Is this an omen of
great things to come!
Not for you apparently,
you get a 2:2 on your lab
report.
