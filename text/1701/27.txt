Imperial Dominates Duathlon with VeloPark Victories

T
he morning
started with an
alarm sounding
at 6:30AM – not
a particularly cruel time
for a triathlete, but for
many students it was a
relaxed Sunday morning
lie-in. Undeterred by the
rain and forecast thunder-
storms, they made their
way over to the Velopark
in Stratford. Travelling on
the tube with a non-folded
bicycle was experienced
for the first time by
many, with a few hardy
members seeking to save
themselves the hassle and
cycle the twelve miles to
Stratford instead. Imperial
Triathlon had twelve
teams of three entered into
the competition, which
meant that just shy of half
the field was filled with
Imperial’s finest.
Many of the Imperial
athletes had never done
a duathlon before, with
most coming from a
background in only one of
the triathlon holy trinity
of swimming, cycling or
running. Some had never
raced running or on a bike
before (special mention
goes to Liv Papaioannou
who was unable to change
gear for the first two laps
of her bike leg), and many
had never done a triathlon
transition before – yet
everyone learnt on the job
and finished the race!
Despite the course
being suitably saturated
“With
thunderous
support from
the crowd,
Imperial were
dominating”
“It was no
surprise that
they took
home more
than their
fair share of
medals, with 6
Imperial teams
appearing in
the top 10”
with water, the rain fortu-
nately held off for the start
of the race. The duathlon
consisted of a two mile
run, six mile cycle, one
mile run for each person,
meaning the team of
three would complete the
one-mile circuit a total of
27 times.
The first leg began
at 9:30, starting with
the run. Pre-race hype
combined with thinking
the course was shorter
than it was (figure-of-
eight courses can be
deceiving) meant pacing
among the front-runners
was somewhat optimis-
tic. After two laps of
the course the first few
entered the transition area,
which can either make or
break a multi-event race.
This time everyone
passed through transition
without trouble and
mounted their bikes
without hiccup or hesita-
tion. Six bike laps were
next on the agenda for
the duathletes, with the
wet conditions and tight
corners making this a
relatively technical ride.
Yet with thunderous
support from the crowd,
Imperial were dominat-
ing.
IC were holding first
place in the men’s, mixed
and women’s teams. Club
captain Edmund Jones
was first into the final
transition of the first leg
athletes, where he (and
everyone behind him)
now faced another run.
Mercifully this run was
half the distance of the
first.
The first-timers to
duathlon quickly noticed
that running after cycling
is much more difficult
than running before
cycling, and the phenom-
ena known as ‘heavy-leg
syndrome’ was experi-
enced by all.
With the expected
downpour still to materi-
alise, the relay transitions
began to occur, at which
point everything became
a lot more confusing.
As competitors were at
different stages of the
race it was not really clear
who was beating who, or
which lap they were on,
which made for some
unexpected surprises later
on. Imperial’s ‘all the
gear and no idea’ team
featuring Edmund Jones,
Ed Clark, and Romain
(the Rocket) Barnoud
thought they had the win
in the bag when they were
over one lap ahead of 2nd
place. Only problem was
the 2nd place team (which
were sadly not Imperial)
were actually on the
same lap and it became
apparent the men’s race
was going to come down
to a photo-finish.
Romain was living up
to his nickname on the
bike with his fastest lap
averaging 38km/h, but
it was only just enough
– Imperial came out on
top with a two-second
win in a staggering time
of 1:45:50. The women’s
race was still led by
who both produced star
performances despite
learning it all on the go.
The fastest mixed team
wenttoGregJones,Fergus
Johnson (who had the
fastest run split of the day),
and Liv Papaioannou.
After the first few teams
had finished, everyone
gathered together to cheer
the remaining duathletes,
with a particularly ebul-
lient applause for the last
runner to finish.
With everyone home
and dry, the medal
ceremony followed. With
such breadth and depth in
the Imperial cohort it was
no surprise that they took
home more than their fair
share of medals, with six
Imperial teams appearing
in the top ten.
The team then began
the long journey home –
tired, proud, and in want
of a shower. Overall, a
highly successful outing
for Imperial Triathlon
both in terms of experi-
ence gained and medals
won.
