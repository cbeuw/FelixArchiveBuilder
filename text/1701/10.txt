his book had the longest odds of the entire
shortlist before the announcement of the
winner, at 7-1. Like Milkman, Kushner’s
novel is also incredibly experimental,
both in theme and form. The Mars Room is not
an easy read, being about mass incarceration in
the United States. It follows the story of Romy
Hill, a 29-year-old single mother serving two
consecutive life sentences for killing her stalker.
C
ritics have unanimously acknowledged
the power of Esi Edugyan’s tale of slavery
and escape. The eponymous protagonist,
Washington Black, was a slave on
a 19th
century sugar plantation in Barbados
before escaping and hopping from continent to
continent, job to job. This is less a book about
slavery than the burden, responsibility and guilt
of personal freedom in a time of slavery, and later,
The Man Booker Prize 2018: a rundown of the shortlist
The Man Booker Prize is one of the most prestigious and closely-watched literary prizes in the world. The 2018
winner was announced on Tuesday, and goes to Anna Burns’s Milkman. Felix Books editor Jingjie Cheng gives a
rundown of this year’s six shortlisted books.
A
nna Burns is the first Northern Irish writer to
win the coveted prize – previous Irish writers
have all been from the Republic. She is also
the first female writer to win since 2013,
when Eleanor Catton won for The Luminaries. The
Booker’s chair of judges, philosopher Kwame Anthony
Appiah, called her book “incredibly original”. Indeed,
it is the most experimental of the shortlist. The story
is narrated by an unnamed 18-year-old girl, known as
“middle sister”, who is being pursued by a much older
paramilitary figure, the“milkman”. There are no names

sympathies to the narrator and paint a picture of what
it is like to live in the time of the Troubles, under the
constant threat of terrible violence. According to the
judges, it is a very current novel, addressing issues of
a divided society and sexual harrassment. It is not an
easy book to get through – Appiah admitted that it
was “challenging”, but “enormously rewarding” if one
persisted till the end. It remains to be seen if Milkman
becomes widely popular, but it has certainly shaken
the conventions of genre.
after abolition. Based on a true story, this novel
is as much of a page-turner as it is sensitive and
ambitious in scope. Edugyan was last shortlisted
for the prize in 2011, for Half Blood Blues, which
was about a black teenage music genius in Hitler’s
Germany. If the Booker is increasingly seen as
losing touch with what might be popular on
the ground, the shortlisting of this book proves
otherwise.
Milkman, by Anna Burns
Kushner is well-researched, and describes prison
life with sensitivity and detail. This book is less
about the individual lives as a comment about
the American justice system, where no one has
choices and everyone is guilty, especially the poor
and socially disadvantaged. Everyone is trapped
in their circumstances. In spite of its difficult
subject matter, this is a book that stays with one
on a deeper level.

he Long Take is experimental in a way that is
different from this year’s winner Milkman.
It is a mixture of lyrical prose and beautiful
poetry, challenging the idea of what a
novel can be. Robertson is a celebrated Scottish
poet, and The Long Take has the quality of an epic
poem. It is a poetical fiction narrative of over
200 pages modelled after the black-and-white
Hollywood films produced around the 1940s and
1950s, such as Out of the Past and Kiss Me Deadly.

verything Under is Daisy Johnson’s first
novel, and had she won, she would have

prize.Shedidn’t,butthisisstillanincredible
debut novel, a reworking of the Oedipus myth
in the context of a troubled mother-daughter
relationship. Unlike the more experimental
shortlists of recent years, Johnson’s novel is very
readable, but at the same time illuminating and full
of unsettling twists and unexpected dark corners.
From the beginning, the narrator, Gretel, writes

his was the book most touted to win, which
Ladbrokes had at 5-2 the day before the
awards ceremony. This is a book that spans

of trees – yes, trees – to connect the various storylines.
Powers won the National Book Award in 2006 for The
Echo Maker, but is generally less well-known in Europe
than in the States. Some commentators have said
that the judges would hesitate to award the prize to
the third American in a row. This might be true. Often
writing about the expanse of nature, The Overstory is
his 12th
novel, and a long one at nearly 500 pages.
The environmental message is heartfelt and timely.
Critics have described the writing in The Overstory as
beautiful, lyrical, and of a richness that reminds one
of Thoreau and Emerson. Despite its lofty theme,
individual characters are well-developed and their
interweaving stories described with sensitivity and
insight. These are characters related to plants, trees
and ecology in one way or another, coming together
against the backdrop of the history of migration to
America.
that “there are more beginnings than there are
endings to contain them”, a line befitting a novel
that weaves around memory, histories and the
complexities of life. Johnson rose to prominence
in the literary scene with her instant classic Fen,
a collection of short stories tied together by the
wilderness of the fens and their inhabitants. Her
debut novel has the same shape-shifting quality,
an attempt to quantify loss and change but in the
end realising the impossibility of such a task and
basking in its beauty instead.
The Overstory, by Richard Powers
The protagonist, Walker, is a soldier who survived
the invasion of Europe, only to return home to find
himself out of place in a world busy again with its
obsession with money and power. In his postwar
odyssey he travels across America, and Robertson
describes his journey as an ode to the land. The
writing is beautiful, and Walker a masterpiece of
characterisation. This is a book most definitely
considered a work of art.
