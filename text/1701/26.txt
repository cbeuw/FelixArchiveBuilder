T
he first game of
the 2XV’s season
was a home
match against
Queen Mary’s, a side
who last season were 2
leagues above us. Due
to this theoretical gulf in
quality, the Queen Mary’s
side decided to turn up 45
minutes late, leaving little
time for a warm up. Little
did they know that this
2XV side were fired up
and ready to go after their
2 hour warm up, and had
a passionate fan base in
the 1XV supporting them
on the sidelines for added
motivation. The shining
sun allowed for intense
and quick rugby to be
played and Imperial began
at a ferocious pace, going
through several phases in
the opposition 22. Sorrell
Cowen in particular was
makingbreaksforfun,reg-
ularly chopping through
the Queen Mary’s centres.
Despite this early period
of pressure, Imperial were
unable to make it count
and Queen Mary’s cleared
their lines. As the game
progressed and the effect
of our extended warm
up became apparent, the
Queen Mary’s forwards
employed a strong pick-
and-go game that put our
time when they bundled
over after a mistake at
the lineout from Imperial.
The Queen Mary’s fly half
subsequently missed the
kick and we went into the
sheds 5-0 down. A half
time chat focusing on
being more accurate fol-
lowed, and a fiery speech
from new 2XV captain
Gustave RDB meant that
Imperial kicked off the
second half re-energised.
Strong carries from the
forwards allowed for
cleaner ball and the 2XV
rumbled towards the line.
Cynical play from one of
the Queen Mary’s players
resulted in him being
sent off, and a number
of dominant scrums built
momentum for an eventu-
al score by Rory Horder.
Daniel Kirrane converted
to put Imperial into the
lead by 2 points with 10
minutes to play. The final
quarter of the game was an
example of the maturity
this 2XV side has devel-
oped over the past few
seasons, with the game
closing out with little
incident. Celebrations
followed as the freshers
were introduced to Sylvia
and the 2XV extended
their purple patch, losing
only once in the past two
seasons.
electric speed, darting for
the line. The SOAS de-
fenders caught up to him
but they were no match
for the superhuman power
of Thornton, who carried
three of them over the line
with him; an exceptional
individual try.
ICURFC later found
themselves under
pressure within their own
22. Following a strong
defensive effort and a
back, making it 10-5 at the
break (I think).
After SOAS took the
lead early in the second
half with a converted try,
Imperial found them-
selves back on the front
foot. The ball went out
to the backs, and after
some silky handling Tom
Watson used his pace to
round the defence and
finish well under the posts.
Marco, who later punched
SOAS’s very own Nish
Khumar, converted for the
extras, 17-12.
SOAS were struggling
to defend against the
strong ball carries from
the likes of Ed Peterson,
James King and Si-Woo,
but managed to level the
scoring with a breakaway
try. Following a scrum
inside the SOAS 22, a
number 8 pickup saw
Thornton clear the line
for his second try of the
afternoon. I won’t go into
too much detail but it was
as amazing as his first.
With a fully drained
bench as a result of
injury, tired legs showed
for Imperial, with SOAS
scoring a few more
towards the end of the
second half. I’m told the
final score was 34-27 in
favour of the home side.
Based on the final score,
it’s clear someone else
scored a try at some point
during the match though I
can’t remember who and
they didn’t claim it when
the 3s group chat was
consulted.
There were plenty of
positives to take away
from Wednesday’s game
and it promises to be a
good season for this group
of players. If we all keep
the effort up in training
we will be where we want
to be in no time.

A
rriving with a
squad of 19 to
Regent’s park,
and conditions
looking ideal for a game
of running rugby, the stage
was set for what promised
to be a tough first game
against a rather unknown
SOAS 1st
XV.
As SOAS went through
phases following kick off,
Imperial’s defence was
proving difficult to break
down thanks to the focus
on defensive structure
in training last Saturday
and Monday. Following a
turnover, it was Imperial’s
turn to attack, utilising
strong carries off the
number 9 before moving
the ball wide with success.
It was scrum-half Shuya
who finished for the first
five points of the game.
Shuya had an overall solid
game, demonstrating his
attacking flair that will
no doubt be an asset this
season.

lead when Thornton
