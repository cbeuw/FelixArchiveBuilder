S
ince the fiscal
stimulus of tax
cuts that the
Trump administra-
tion has implemented this
year, the US economy on
the surface has been doing
great. It has notched a
4.1% annualized growth
rate for Q2, which is
considerably faster than
the 2% growth rate that
has been standard since
2001. Then in mid-August
US stocks hit an all-time
high as the S&P 500
broke its longest Bull run
in history. Naturally then,
the Federal Reserve and
many investors became
sceptical that this growth
was sustainable, and
that the US economy
was ‘overheating’. So,
it didn’t come as a sur-
prise when The Federal
Open Market Committee
increased the Fed funds
rate by 25 basis points
to 2.25%. However, the
dawning realisation that
the Fed could increase
rates further was met
with anxiety. A ferocious
government sell off of
sovereign bonds that
started at the beginning of
this month, has started to
pinch at the equity markets
as investors are worried
about the implications of
higher treasury yields.
Last week what began as a
gradual sell-off escalated
into a violent dive causing
brutal losses in Asia, in
particular the tech-heavy
Taiwanese market, trick-
ling through to Europe
and then coming back
to the US market again.
At the market close last
Thursday $1.7trn had been
wiped off the S&P 500.
Curiously, the emerging
markets remained un-af-
fected which is surprising
as they have been battered
by the rising strength
double digit increases in
inflation. Despite this this
doesn’t mean investors
should completely exit
their positions in EM
economies. Prices for EM
stocks are plummeting
to fresh lows and the
brave investor could
find a bargain. Equity
valuations are trading in
excess of 40% discount
to the US market in term
of P/E ratios according to
Mobius Capital Partners.
This may be the time as
well with the European
bond market looking
precarious with the Italian
yield crisis. The European
Commission and Rome
are currently in a spat and
the new Italian populist
government plans to run
a higher budget deficit.
After officials agreed a
deficit target of 2.4%,
busting the 2 % maximum
that Finance minister
Giovanni Tria said he’d
accept, yields on the
Italian bond soared a
whopping 40 basis points
to 3.3%. Consequently,
Investor’s negative bets
on Italian government
debt have peaked, indicat-
ing that these new budget
proposals have fuelled
concern. Filippo Lanza,
chief investment officer
at London based hedge
fund Numen Capital, said
‘Italian bonds are already
discounting downgrades
from Moody’s and S&P…
The market believes that
the government has set
a spread of 400bp as a
target, but at 3235bp to
350bp we expect to see
short covering as the
market discounts the
game plan and we think
eventually a comprise will
be found between govern-
ment and the European
Commission’.
So is an economic
downturn approaching.
Yes. Inevitably there will
be a market correction at
some point, whether that
triggered by the growing
liabilities of governments
or the effect of struggling
emerging markets
slumping world growth.
However, currently I
think the market is strong.
Central banks have started
to increase policy rates
and we are beginning to
reduce our dependence
of quantitative easing,
but the greatest threats
to the global economy is
political. Ironically, the
Trump administration is
not only the cause of the
booming economy but
also its biggest threat.
By imposing tariffs not
only on China but on
“Equity

of the dollar and US
economy. EM fared well
after the financial crisis
when record low treasury
and Eurobond yields
as well as programmes
such as quantitative
easing caused investors
to flood money into EM
economies as they sought
higher returns. However,
recent tightening of US
monetary policy and the
subsequent rise in the
dollar has caused money
to flood out. Furthermore,
with the majority of EM’s
having debt denominated
in dollars rather than the
local currency, means that
as the dollar strengthens
it becomes harder and
more expensive to pay
back their debt. This has
caused EM with large
current account deficits
[a high dependency of
foreign investment] and
high external debt like
South Africa, Turkey,
Brazil and Argentina to
suffer considerably. So
far this year the Argentine
peso is down 50% against
the dollar, the Turkish lira
is down almost 40% after
President Erdogan raised
economic tensions after
his controversial com-
ments on interest rates
which he called a ‘tool of
exploitation’ making the
central bank wait months
to raise rates, despite
