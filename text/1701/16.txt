A coming of age play about the queer experience // Pleasance Theatre
Bottom: A queer bildungsroman
B
ottom. A term
used to describe
a person in a
gay relationship
who prefers to be the
one penetrated. However,
this simple expression of
which sexual position one
prefers has many other
deep rooted connotations
and assumptions within
queer culture. And it
is these themes which
Willy Hudson brilliantly
addresses in his one man
show Bottom.
Performed in a small
room at Pleasance
Theatre, and also at Edin-
burgh Fringe, the intimate
setting allowed Hudson to
connect with the audience
more easily and involve
them as part of his show.
He begins the show
immediately breaking the
fourth wall, by popping
his head out of the curtain
and stopping the music
as he says he’s not ready
yet. He shuffles onto the
stage through a side door
wearing nothing but a
neon pink towel wrapped
around his waist and
dragging in a big pink bag
with his props. Joining his
simple set of the lower half
of a mannequin wearing
boxers on one side, and a
microphone stand on the
other side, the focus is
on the partially nude man
standing in front of you.
He proceeds to ask an
audience member to pass
him his underwear from
under their seat, and gets
two other people to hold
his towel tightly as he
starts getting dressed. We
wait as we watch him
get fully clothed, making
little jokes about the
pattern on his socks, until
he proudly dons a t-shirt
with a head-to-toe picture
of Beyoncé printed on
it. Within these first few
minutes, the general
theme and nature of the
play has been defined as a
comedic display of queer
culture.
he made the action, the
audience was transported
into the scene as panic
rises over the character
about why he is unable
to get stimulated. The
lights change and Hudson
moves from centre stage
to stage left where he
begins to speak into the
microphone about erectile
dysfunction disorder. This
change in tone where he
speaks about a topic from
his life or queer culture
is a theme which carries
on through the play and
allows Hudson to have
more flexibility about the
range of topics he can
touch upon.
The play continues to
describe Hudson’s story
of meeting up with a guy
on the gay dating app
Grindr, and explaining
how the date had gone
terribly wrong, especially
as he, who has only
bottomed in the past, now
fails to get an erection in
the one situation where
he tries to top. Whilst this
may seem like a raunchy
tale of sexual crisis and
trivial matters of preferred
sexual position, Hudson
was able to hit many key
notes about the LGBT+
experience and queer
culture.
Throughout the play he
touches upon topics such
as how straight women
sometimes use gay men
as toys for their own en-
tertainment (referred to as
fag hags), the concept that
tops or bottoms can be
predicted based upon their
external appearance and
attitude, and the internal-
ised homophobia within
the queer community
when it comes to giving
more respect to ‘straight
acting’ butch gay men. I
feel that in some respects
viewers who are not part
of or closely related to
the LGBT+ community
may not understand the
full depth of the topics
being discussed. Particu-
larly focussing on the core
theme of the play which
is bottoming and sexual
positions, Hudson is
somehow able to address
the issue with an air of
humour yet seriousness
at the same time. He
humour, integrated with
consistent and high quality
audience participation,
made the experience
much better than anything
I would have expected.
My only qualm was
that at points the flow of
the otherwise amazing
play was interrupted and
may have caused some
confusion. I was unsure
whether Hudson purpose-
ly broke character as part
of the play or if it was by
accident.At certain points,
the lights changed and lit
up a different part of the
stage, and Hudson made
an audible realisation that
he was supposed to move
on, but this didn’t register
as smoothly as it could
have done. However, I
do commend the use of
breaking the fourth wall.
During one scene the
character is attempting to
demonstrate his desire for
being a top on the man-
nequin on the stage but is
unable to do so. Hudson
breaks character and asks
the tech director for what
he was supposed to do
and she replies from the
back of the room asking
whether he would like
to try again, to which he
eventually asks to move
on. This seemed very real
in the moment and added
a new layer to the play.
Overall, this was one
of the best amateur plays
I have seen, and was very
well suited to the small
size of the theatre. It was
honestly a pleasure to
watch!
Written and performed by Willy Hudson, his one-man show Bottom shares funny, awkward and entertaining
experiences.

“...wearing

Hudson begins to talk
about his recent sexual en-
counter where he runs into
the bathroom as he feels
very embarrassed that he
is unable to become erect.
Using perfectly timed
tech cues to play the
sound of a door locking
and turning on the tap as

speaks on the obsession
of describing one’s sexual
position preference on
dating apps, degrading
other men to just their
holes, and how the
imminent question of ‘top
or bottom?’ will always
appear early on when
speaking to someone on
these apps. But Hudson
doesn’t hesitate to dig
even deeper and exposes
the internalised homo-
phobia that many gay
men have in idolising the
butch men who can give
them the shred of fantasy
of being in a ‘normal’
heterosexual relationship,
and subsequently degrad-
ing other men for being
too femme.
