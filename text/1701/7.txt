Kavanaugh: The aggressor or the victim?
The legal system works under the
principle that one is innocent until
proven guilty,
It’s a job interview, not a criminal
case. You don’t have to prove guilt.
Also, did I mention he sucks ass?

Eshbaugh wrote
an article titled
“Stuck in my Kava-
craw” about US supreme
court nominee Brett
Kavanaugh. In the rather
polemical piece he
called Kavanaugh “non-
human”, “a nympho
who raped people”
and a “perv”. Henry
claimed that there were
multiple credible and
corroborating witnesses
against the US Supreme
Court nominee.
I want to get the
facts straight: On
July 9, US president
Trump nominated
Judge Kavanaugh to
the US Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh had served
the previous 12 years on
the 2nd most important
US court, was a lecturer at
Harvard Law School and
had otherwise flawless
academic credentials and
a brilliant CV.
He had passed 6 FBI
background checks
previously and answered
a total of 1297 questions
in the Supreme Court
hearings. On July 30,
Dr. Christine Blasey
Ford, a professor of
were high schoolers in
Maryland. She asked to
have the issue treated
confidentially and remain
anonymous. The case
remained secret until 13
September when her letter
got leaked to the media (by
Feinstein?) and several
outlets like Washington
Post, New York Times
and The New Yorker
ran stories on her. Since
then two other witnesses,
Deborah Ramirez and
Julie Swetnick came
forward with allegations
against Kavanaugh who
vehemently denied all
accusations. In the wake
of the #metoo-movement,
a media spectacle started.
Both Dr. Ford and
Judge Kavanaugh made
statements in front of
the US Senate Judicial
Committee, repeating
their initial statements.
Amidst the controversy,
the senators decided to
open a FBI investigation
into the matter and find
T
hree weeks ago,
I wrote an article
titled “Stuck in
my Kava-craw”
about how badly this
CHUD sucks at his job.
And yeah, I hit the notes
on his multiple accusers
pointing to sexual mis-
conduct in multiple cases
over many years. This
isn’t a criminal case. He’s
not going to go to jail. This
isn’t a matter for the fuck-
ing justice system. He’s
just not going to get the
job. Or, he wouldn’t, if the
government wasn’t full of
spineless partisan hacks
acting in bad faith and
trying to cover their own
ass with a SCOTUS ap-
pointment. There’s clearly
a much lower standard for
disqualification here than
my comment compatriot
would lead you to believe,
and the whole complaint
is essentially that the
government is currently
made up of unprincipled
dipshits.
Furthermore, the FBI
probe he points to was
limited in scope to the
point where corroborating
witnesses were barred
from testifying by the
executive that nominated
him. Folks from the FBI
in senate testimony essen-
tially noted that this probe
was a farce, politically
motivated to the core, and
essentially useless insofar
as “proving guilt” goes.
This was obvious to any
spectator not marinading
in Breitbart.
But hey, if you wanna
regurgitate alt-right
talking points you licked
off the grass: we don’t
even need to talk about
these allegations. There
are fairly trivial points
against him.
How about the fact
that Kavanaugh was the
only guy on the Federalist
Society shortlist who
believes that 1. there
shouldn’t be federal
probes into misconduct by
sitting presidents (conven-
ient for Agent Orange),
and 2. there shouldn’t be
double-jeopardy state-
wise (in other words, the
SDNY probe into Trump’s
shitty finances is barred
too). If he gets his nom-
ination he’ll have a free
judge in the pocket. Real
nice, guys. I wonder why
Trump, a president who’s
facing a state and federal
probe into his shady
dealings, and a guy with
authoritarian leanings,
would want to stack the
court in his favor?
Doesn’t it seem strange
that this is his unique
selling point over anyone
else on the shortlist, and
it would’ve been cake
to retract his nomination
and vomit up some other
nitwit, but the Republi-
cans decided to fight a
pitched battle to get him
appointed?
But we don’t even need
to go there. How about the
fact that Kavanaugh was
a part of the Bush white
house - a dude who wrote
legal briefs defending
torture? Don’t tell me
a guy like that deserves
a place on the Supreme
psychology at Palo Alto
University and registered
Democrat, wrote a letter
to Democratic senator
Dianne Feinstein,
claiming that Kavanaugh
had tried to rape her in
the 1980s when both

corroborating witnesses.
After a thorough and
deep investigation, the
FBI produced a several
hundred page long report
that found: nothing! No
corroborating witnesses,
no evidence, if all
Kavanaugh’s credibility
was strengthened and
the credibility of the
three accusers severely
damaged.
Dr. Ford had named 3
witnesses of the alleged
party where supposedly
Kavanaugh tried to rape
her: Mark Judge (he
denied that the party
had ever happened), PJ
Smyth (also denied this
party ever happened) and
her best friend from high
school, Leyland Keyser.
Keyser responded under
oath she did not even
know Kavanaugh and had
never been at a party with
him. Dr. Ford could not
remember any details of
the party: Where was the
house? Which year did it
happen? Who brought her
to the house?Who brought
her home? Whose house
was it? Did she confide
in anyone? Nothing. Only
thing she remembered: it
was Kavanaugh and she
had one beer.
The second accuser,
Julie Swetnick, said
Kavanaugh was the leader
Court - they’re supposed
to have something of a
moral compass. Funny
how that was sealed and
never a matter of discus-
sion for the senate.
How about the fact that
if you really wanted to
repeal Roe v. Wade, you
could just appoint Allison
Eid? Just play the idpol
game, you nitwits. Watch
the libs squirm - this
is the American “left”
we’re talking about, and
privileged as they are,
they seem incapable of
talking about economic
injustice in any fucking
form. Y’ever wonder why
Hillary lost?
We don’t even need to
go there. How about the
matter of judicial temper-
ment? “I’ve never blacked
out, senator. Have you?”
Fucking please. I get to
spout shit because this is
theFelixcommentsection,
and being entertaining is
therefore something of my
job. Does this seem like
temperment worthy of the
higest court in a nation
of 300 million people, a
lifetime appointment? He
obviously doesn’t have a
suitable temperment. Hell,
it’s kind of ironic that this
portion of the testimony
was about his drinking,
because it seemed to me
(a student, and thereby
one who drinks) like he
knocked some scotch
back over lunch. How do
you make these comments
sober?
Hell, how about the
fact that he perjured
himself multiple times
during his testimony?
There are supposedly
criminal consequences to
this. What do you think
they wrote up Bill Clinton
for? He should have been
censured by the senate
and summarily dismissed,
but unfortunately, we live
in Hell.
What about the shady
way in which these pro-
ceedigns started? Why did
Anthony Kennedy resign?
Something smells; he
hired clerks for next term
already, so this was clearly
a spur-of-the-moment
decision. It definitely
doesn’t have anything
to do with the fact that
his son was at Deutsche
Bank (recently fined a
historic sum for launder-
ing Russian money), in
charge of the real estate
division, during the Great
Recession. Trump was
at the time well-known
to be a bad businessman;
he was on the verge of
sinking, and he was saved
by - guess who? There’s a
funny clip where Trump’s
just finished a State of the
Union address -- he shakes
Anthony Kennedy’s hand
and mostly talks about
how great his son is. Does
something smell funny to
you?
Or what about the
obscene debts developed
from “buying season
tickets to baseball games”
that definitely weren’t
gambling debts? Does it
seem strange to you that
these were paid off by a
dark-money group (like
the one that paid Collins
six figures for her vote up).
Where was the pointed
line of questioning?
I know Latin too, you
know -- to close, I’ll
provide my own; thank
Henry Beard for the trans-
lation. Te oportet futuere
tete. Tu tibi futuendus es.
Velim te futuas. Te rogo ut

Cheers, bud.

of a gang rape ring and
named 4 witnesses: 2 of
them did not respond to
interview requests, one
was already deceased
and one plainly denied
knowledge of any such
ring or incidents.
Similarly, the FBI
could not find any
corroborating witnesses
from an incident at Yale
University that Deborah
Ramirez had described.
The interviewees that the
FBI asked, denied any
knowledge of any incident
involving Kavanaugh and
Ramirez. Requests by
FBI officials to give more
evidence, were ignored by
Ramirez’s lawyers.
All accusations against
Kavanaugh came down
crashing like a house
of cards. On October 6,
Judge Kavanaugh was
confirmed with a senate
vote of 50-48 to the US
Supreme Court amidst
hostile and violent
protests of #metoo-
activists. Meanwhile Dr.
Ford has backed down
her claims and does not
want Judge Kavanaugh
to be impeached should
the Democrats win the
US House elections.
She has now walked
away with 700 000 USD
from the GoFundMe-
website. It is unlikely
she will be prosecuted
for her uncorroborated
accusations.
The justice system is
based on the principle of
“innocent until proven
guilty” (Latin maxim:
ei incumbit probatio qui
dicit, non qui negat; the
burden of proof is on the
one who declares, not
on the one who denies).
I would like to ask
everyone to adhere to that
principle and give Brett
Kavanaugh, a man of high
character and academic
credentials, whose name
and reputation were
wrongfully demolished
on the altar of vile,
heinous, unsubstantiated
und uncorroborated
accusations and whose
wife and daughters got
death and rape threats,
what he deserves: respect
and an apology.
