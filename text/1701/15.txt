A Tale of Two Halves: Measure for Measure at the
Donmar
Hayley Atwell and Jack Lowden alternate roles in a retelling that tackles abuse of power and gender politics.
Truth is truth, and
power is power. In her new
staging of Measure for
Measure at the Donmar,
in which Hayley Atwell
and Jack Lowden alter-
nate their roles, director
Josie Rourke sets to out to
show that some things are
universal.
During an evening’s
performance, the stage –
which is dominated by a
backdrop of bars, recalling
the literal and metaphor-
ical imprisonment of the
play’s characters – is both
17th
century Vienna and
modern day London. We
first meet the characters
in 1604, the year of the
play’s first performance.
Isabella (Atwell), a young
nun pleads with Angelo
(Lowden), the recently
promoted judge, for
clemency on behalf of her
brother who has been sen-
tenced to death for sexual
misconduct. Angelo, who
has a reputation of being
an austere and pious man,
agrees, but only if Isabella
yields her virginity in
exchange. At first her
saviour appears to be the
Duke (Nicholas Burns),
who has promoted Angelo
in order to test him. When
the Duke, disguised as a
monk, witnesses Angelo’s
abuses of power go un-
checked, he is determined
to thwart him using any
means possible.
The character of the
Duke is seen to be some-
thing of a divine interven-
tion in most performances
of Measure for Measure,
but here Rourke turns the
character on its head. We
come to realise, that far
from being altruistic, the
Duke only helps Isabella
in order to ingratiate
himself with her and ulti-
mately to hold his power
over her. Having helped
Isabella indict Angelo in
open court, he proposi-
tions her. Realizing that
she is once again trapped,
her answer is a howl of
desperation and anguish.
The stunned theatre
is pitched into darkness;
when the stage lights flash
“Cloisters
become court-
rooms, and the
chains of office
are meta-
morphosed
into red
lanyards
carrying the
key cards of
power”
“The modern
retelling goes
some way in
highlighting
the plight of
male survivors
of sexual
assault”
on again, Isabella has been
reinvented as a deputy
prosecutor in the modern
day who is to be promoted.
The story is retold, with
the roles of Angelo and
Isabella reversed; clois-
ters become courtrooms,
and the chains of office
are metamorphosed into
red lanyards carrying the
key cards of power. Now
it is Isabella – renamed
Isabel – who has the upper
hand and Angelo, a young
Christian, finds himself as
her victim.
What this second half
role reversal is meant
to highlight is a bit of a
mystery. In some respects
sion, the play is more than
a little muddled. In the
period staging, the narra-
tive is taut and incisive.
“Who will believe thee,
Isabel?” counters Angelo
in one scene when Isabella
threatens to expose him.
Present day headlines
echo in those words. With
#MeToo, Harvey Wein-
stein and the Kavanaugh
hearings so fresh in the
public consciousness, the
performance feels very
timely. When left to draw
our own modern parallels
from the period setting,
there is far greater clarity
of intent than when the
narrative is transposed to
the present day.
The modern retelling
goes some way in high-
lighting the plight of
male survivors of sexual
assault. It’s a subject that
needs tackling, a fact
made abundantly clear by
the audience’s laughter
at the scenes in which
Angelo struggles to tell his
brother that he cannot give
in to Isabella’s demands
to save his brother’s life
(the reaction to the same
scene when it was Isabella
who was being exploited
was not so dismissive).
Yet the staging does not
go far enough – Angelo
the novice is never put
in the same position of
powerlessness as Isabella
the novice; we never hear
his howl of pain when re-
her trial takes on a nasty
misogynistic edge when
a recording made without
her permission of her
having sex is uploaded to
the internet to humiliate
her. Rourke brings up in-
teresting questions about
female rage, revenge and
what it is to be a woman in
power, but does not give
the themes enough space
to develop.
Nevertheless, there is
little fault to be found
where the acting is
concerned. Atwell is a
commanding presence
and even as the naive
novice, holds sway over
the stage. In both incarna-
tions of Angelo, Lowden
is splendid, his charm
curdling into sleaziness in
the first half, and cracking
into vulnerability in the
second.
Rourke’s staging is
a complex, immersive
retelling. Even with its
missteps, it’s well worth a
watch.
Rourke seems to be saying
men too can be victims of
sexual assault, and that
power corrupts irrespec-
tive of gender, though it
could be read as Isabella’s
revenge fantasy – her
“measure for measure”.
I considered the former
more likely as I watched
the play unfold, but in
hindsight the latter has
seemed more plausible.
In either case, there is
no getting away from the
fact that after the intermis-
