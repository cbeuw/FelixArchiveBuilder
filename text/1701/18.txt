DRAG at the Hayward Gallery
Over the past few years,
the concept of cross-dress-
ing and the art of drag
has become a popular
topic and, indeed, almost
mainstream. With the
increasing popularity of
the TV competition show
RuPaul’s Drag Race,
the audience exposed to
the once underground
culture of drag has rapidly
increased. However, the
multifaceted world of
gender-bending is perhaps
not effectively portrayed
through a TV show which
focuses primarily on drag
queens and the drama
which ensues between
them. This was the exact
issue which I felt the
DRAG exhibition at
Hayward Gallery handled
very well.
Not knowing
much about what the
gallery was displaying,
I was taken aback by the
simplistic, minimalist
layout of the exhibition
room which wasn’t some-
thing you would usually
associate with drag. With
bare white walls sparsely
decorated with simple
black line art, the room
design offset the eccentric
pieces being displayed,
avoiding complete
sensory overload. The
pieces were not set out in
any kind of chronological
order or themes, which
I felt was fitting given
the free and unbounded
nature of drag. I felt that
the choice of art being
displayed was enjoyable
not only in the variety of
mediums being used, but
also the range of themes
which were tackled.
This was truly an
exhibition about drag and
not just drag queens. The
concept of drag is to have
fun and make a mockery
of the unstable societal
structure of gender and
gender roles. This is not
limited to gender-bending
men as is often portrayed
in mainstream media.
This exhibition included
a plethora of different
types of drag, displaying
both drag kings and drag
queens, androgynous
pieces of work, over-the-
top performance drag as
well as more politically
driven types of drag.
Whilst the majority of the
media used in the exhibi-
tion was photography and
videos, the odd painting
and even a makeup wipe
(with a face of drag
makeup painted on) was
also displayed. This
diverse range of themes
and art styles made the
experience non-repetitive,
and much more enjoyable.
The beautiful
photographs ranged from
stunning self-portraits to
strange, conceptual pieces
which had been heavily
edited. These often
intimate pictures added a
new layer of closeness to
the topic of drag within
the exhibition, where
it was not being used
merely as performance,
but explored artistic
depth and sometimes
the political motivation
behind the pieces. Along
one wall of the exhibition
was a series of TV screens
(some older box-style
TVs) which integrated
the crucial feature of
performance drag into the
showroom. One played
a part of Rose English’s
comedy performance ‘My
Mathematics’, where she
donned excessively long
false eyelashes and went
on to offer members of
the audience a gentle
butterfly kiss or “violent
lashings from her lashes”.
Other videos included
funny drag makeup tu-
torials, weird black and
white silent films, and a
collection of performance
art by the legendary Leigh
Bowery. However, my
favourite by far was the
spoken word performance
‘Tell me everything you
saw, and what you think
it means’ by Victoria Sin
who is a hyper queen
(a cis-gendered female
doing drag in the style of
typical male drag queens).
In this piece, Sin poses
lying down, propped up
on one arm, remaining
incredibly still aside from
the gentle blinking of her
eyes. This is accompanied
by a spoken word piece
encouraging the viewer to
look carefully at her body,
the softness in her posture,
and the exaggerated
features of her makeup.
She warns the viewer that
you will soon no longer
be able to see her, and to
take a final look. Yet once
the screen goes black, you
remain entranced by the
soft voice of the narrator
describing how she exits
the frame and walks out
into reality.
Whilst I did enjoy the
exhibition, I found that
I left seeing some very
pretty pictures and being
entertained but not much
more than that. According
to the exhibition descrip-
tion, the pieces touched
upon many topics such
as the AIDS crisis, gay
rights and many other
political movements from
the 1960s to the modern
day. Unfortunately, I felt
that this was not clearly
explored when viewing
the pieces of art, leaving
the viewer bewildered
about the meaning behind
the pieces. This was a
particular problem with
the abstract pieces, which
would have benefited from
some commentary about
what the artist was ulti-
mately trying to explore.
As no such commentary
was provided (other than
a few guided tours), I left
feeling slightly under-
whelmed, not having fully
understood the meaning
behind all the pieces. All
in all, I felt that while
DRAG was successful in
showcasing many features
of the drag world, the lack
of explanation made it
difficult to enjoy the exhi-
bition to its full potential.
A wide-ranging exhibition that showcases the variety to be found in the art form.
