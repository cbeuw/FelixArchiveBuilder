S
omeone once told
me that bad news
come in threes.
That person, like
all people, was almost
definitely wrong: there is
no limit on the number
of bad things that can
happen at once. As an ex-
ample, this week featured
an announcement that
the Brexit negotiations
will be extended, that
a Saudi journalist was
killed and two Royal
announcements. One
can only admire the
media obedience as they
desperately chased any
shred of story about our
scaly overlords. At this
point the only image that
adequately represents the
British media would be
a man with his testicles
nailed to his forehead
as the Queen belabours
him about the face with a
cricket bat, demanding to
know whether he put in at
least a page about Diana.
Fuck.
In case you didn’t
know, the Royals are
lizards.
How the fuck did it
come to this? At this point
in time we have been
obsessing over the mating
rites of Princess Eugenie
and faceless white guy
no. 2779000. I mean, no
newspapers have talked
about the post-nuptial
ceremony where bride
and groom sacrifice the
poorest person in the land
between them in an orgy
of lizard related violence.
With the current high
rates of homelessness, it
is often hard to determine
exactly who the poorest
is, but compromises are
made. It is of course only
the financially poor that
the reptiles can consume
in this way. If it were
emotional poverty, Brit-
ain’s CEOs would have
something to worry about.
However, as most of them
are at least admirers of
the cult of Royalty, it is
possible that they would
not object too much.
At the same wedding,
as most of you are
probably aware, Meghan
and Harry announced that
they will be expanding
the Royal bloodline by
beginning a brood of their
own. No one really knows
exactly how many eggs
each Royal queen lays in
a single batch, but what
is known is that only the
strongest survives each
hatching, with the other
hatchlings providing the
fuel for it to reach it’s
first moulting. This is the
point where the official
photos are taken, as the
reptile puts on its first
human skin. A significant
amount of speculation
has been made as to the
skin colour of the next
Royal baby. As always the
colour will mostly depend
on what other infants are
available. The Royal’s
preference for white skin
mostly stems from the fact
that broods are hatched at
the exclusive private wing
of St Mary’s. The real
question is what colour
the crest will be. Most
Royals seem to be born
with a brunette colour,
except for Harry that has
a ginger skin and bone
structure. Although this
calls into doubt his noble
lineage at least one thing
is certain: he is a danger-
ous man-eating lizard.
Some people might say
that this is a pure fantasy,
and I am imagining things
purely for my own gratifi-
cation. Well, if there was
one thing that the Brexit
campaign taught me,
it’s that the electorate is
easily fooled. Not me, not
this time. I recognise the
Royals for what they truly
are: parasites.
