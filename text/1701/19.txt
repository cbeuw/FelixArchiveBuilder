W
ith the rising
storm of
hype brew-
ing around
Red Dead Redemption
2, we thought we’d shed
a light on some of the
features being added and
what you can expect from
the game. The majority
of the information we’ve
got here is straight from
the horse’s mouth, in
particular the developers
themselves, with news
of the game having over
300,000 animations,
500,000 lines of dialogue
and 1000 voice actors for
NPCs, suggesting that
RDR2 has a good chance
of being Game of the Year
by sheer amount of effort
put in.
However, no matter
how much effort was
put in, there are growing
concerns over how much
storage space this will
take up on the PS4 or
Xbox One, with rumours/
leakers stating that the
game takes up over
100GB of hard drive
space; so you may have to
say goodbye to 1/10 or 1/5
of your console’s storage.
But for such a block-
buster of a game it seems
like there’s not going to
be many big name voice
actors, with Rockstar
co-founder Dan Houser
stating “We don’t bring
in named actors anymore
because of their egos
and, most important of
all, because we believe
we get a better sense of
immersion using talented
actors whose voices you
don’t recognize.” .
Story
With already so much
being mentioned it’s time
to take a look at what
the single player has to
offer, with Dan Houser
also stating that the final
script for RDR2 spans
2000 pages and if the
dialogue for additional
content was included and
stacked, the paper stack
would reach eight feet
high (15cm taller than
basketballer Yao Ming).
But even better than this,
Rockstar recently released
a description of the plot:
“America, 1899. The
end of the wild west era
has begun as lawmen hunt
down the last remaining
outlaw gangs. Those
who will not surrender or
succumb are killed. After
a robbery goes badly
wrong in the western town
of Blackwater, Arthur
Morgan and the Van der
Linde gang are forced to
“Dan Houser
also stating
that the final
script for RDR2
spans 2000
pages”
flee. With federal agents
andthebestbountyhunters
in the nation massing on
their heels, the gang must
rob, steal and fight their
way across the rugged
heartland of America in
order to survive. As deep-
ening internal divisions
threaten to tear the gang
apart, Arthur must make
a choice between his own
ideals and loyalty to the
gang who raised him.”
Featuring a young
John Marston in the gang,
the story does seem like
it’s going to be quite the
rodeo. I’ll see myself out.
Gameplay
RDR2 brings back all
the gameplay elements
you loved from RDR
and puts you into a much
grander expansive world
to explore. We can only
tease some of the new ad-
ditions, but these reveals
will keep you waiting in
anticipation.
Be prepared to dive
fully into this world as
you can play the game
literally through the eyes
of Alex Morgan with
the first-person option.
With this feature you can
appreciate the 200 species
which will populate the
world as you try to hunt
for food or avoid getting
bitten by a poisonous
snake.
Merchandising
Set to release for
October 26th, RDR2 will
be released on PS4 and
Xbox One. Unfortunately
the game will not be on
PC, so say goodbye to
your fantasy of using a
texture pack of Thomas
the Tank Engine on trains,
with the Biggie Smalls
remix of its corresponding
theme. Teetering away
from such a depressing
topic, the game will be
priced at £50 upon release,
with the special edition/
collectors edition being
priced at £75 which also
includes a special edition
printed map and various
other content. There is
also an ultimate edition
which is priced at £90
and contains a plethora
of story mode and online
content, along with a
printed version of the
world map and a steelbox
version of the game. But
the pièce de résistance is
the Red Dead Redemption
2: Collectors Box which
includes the game and is
priced at £179.99 , which
includes a metal lockbox
with a lock and key, col-
lectable challenge coin,
double-sized puzzle, six
shooter bandana, treasure
map, pin set, catalogue
from ingame and collect-
able cards.
Controversy
For the fantastic content
that seems to be coming,
there are indeed some
rising scares about the
presence of microtrans-
actions in RDR2 . Given
their overabundance
in Rockstar’s previous
game GTA V, which has
made $6 billion off of
its original $265 million
budget since its release in
2013. Fingers crossed that
the game isn’t a complete
cash grab, however, con-
sidering recent news of
how much effort is being
put into the story it’s a
possibility that the single
player at the very least is
likely to be spared from
microtransactions.
Moving on from one
problem that is plaguing
the gaming industry to
another; Telltale as many
know, recently went
bankrupt which resulted
in the mass layoff of
employees many of
which without severance
and no payment for their
overtime! A similar fright
was given when Dan
Houser tweeted a state-
ment that included “We
were working 100-hour
weeks”, resulting in a
massive backlash as
people speculated that
employees were being
forced to do overtime in
order to finish the games
before its release, similar
to that of Telltale. Dan
Houser promptly respond-
ed with a tweet, a section
of the tweet reads “After
working on the game for
seven years, the senior
writing team, which
consists of four people,
Mike Unsworth, Rupert
Humphries, Lazlow and
myself, had, as we always
do, three weeks of intense
work when we wrapped
everything up. Three
weeks, not years.”, the
rest of the tweet then goes
on to discuss how that
the 100 hour work weeks
were a decision made
purely out of affection
for the series and by their
own volition.
“300,000
animations ,
500,000 lines
of dialogue
and 1000 voice
actors for
NPCs”
What’s that coming over the hill? // Rockstar
