Well, some people bothered to do
these last term, and as it’s revision and
my tits have fallen off due to bore-
dom, I thought I would crack out some
more. This week’s exquisite mix are all
based around music, so they are pretty
simple. I will offer bonus points if you
send in an interesting fact with your
answers. Well done to Team Shotgun.
All correct answers should be sent
via electronic mail (or carrier pigeon)
to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Or
better still come and see us down here
in the felix office in the West wing of
Beit. It’s close to the bar, full of Imperi-
al’s hot girl fraternity and we are quite
possible the coolest club about. Well
much better than the rowers. But that
is stating the bloody obvious really.

felix FAIL!
Which felix editor has FAILED his week?
This weeks epic fail belongs to
Fonzie. What did he fail at? Work.
As of writing it is Monday after-
noon, and we had both agreed to
come in to the felix office to do a bit
of work for the news-
paper, however Fonzie
managed to sit down,
procrastinate for 20 min-
utes and then leave. No work done
what so ever. An epic fail me
thinks. Worse yet the reason for
leaving is because he wanted to go
with his better half to get bicycle
light. WHIPPED!!!
K
aplowowow!!!! Term nu-
mero trois is here. Let’s be
honest here this term is
going to be hella ma busy
for you guys, exams are
coming in left, right and centre. I was
walking in the park the other day, and
Whammy I was hit by an exam. Seri-
ously there must be a better way to as-
sess your academic ability than a few
hours bunched together at the end of
the year, which won’t even cover all the
material your have learned! OK now
for a joke.
“Thanks to the
credit crunch, the
value of Pi had
fallen to e.”
I know, I know, that was pretty lame,
but how else am I supposed to break
up the tension. This joking about the
credit crunch does lead my nicely to
tell you about my latest adventures. In
case you haven’t guessed from the col-
umn title, and picture, you favourite fe-
lix editor (that’s me, and yes I’m being
big headed) has battled with scissors...

and lost. That is to say my hair failed
to break the metal blades and thusly I
have had my hair cut. Well as the tale
goes, my mother bribed my to cut my
hair. How? Well let me first tell you
that for the last two years (the time my
hair has been long) she has with out
fail hated my hair. She made sly com-
ments, like “you look like a homeless
man!” or “you’d look so much better
without all that hair!” To be honest she
was right, but being the rebellious in-
dividual that I am, I never listened to
her. Well one day she was so annoyed
that she said “If you cut your hair, I’ll
buy you a whole new wardrobe.” Now
this sounded like a good deal to me.
I needed new clothes, and I have no
money. The answer seem obvious, and
as you now know, I did it.
One day I decided to go to a place
called Pimps and Pinups. Now this
place was unreal cool! With the words
“do whatever you want” I let the hair-
dresser go wild on my hair, and now
I look like this. Best of all they sup-
plied my with beer while they cut my
hair. Now I don’t know if it’s because I
haven’t had my hair cut for a long time,
but this has never happened to me be-
fore. Top Score!

So you are a medic.
And a rower. I think
I have found the
worst combination
of human being
possible. I pity the
scum that decided to pro-create and produce
you. You spout shit about how buff your rowers
look, then go on to tell everyone how good you
are at rowing. You must admit that you are not
really that good, just a fucking idiot.
Horoscopes. These will be offensive, deal with it!

Virgo
This week you find
that you are the child
of a sperm donor. As
the law now allows
you to find out the
father, you feel you
must. Unfortunately for you it turns out that
the phrase ‘donor’ is a little loose when used
in this situation. It turns out that you father is
unknown as your mother was gang raped late
in 1986 by 10 youths. Ha fucking ha.
Scorpio
This week’s going to
be one to forget. That
exam you spent ages
revising for... well
guess what? You failed.
Miserably. You know
that girl you’ve been pining over? She’s off with
another fella. You know those parents that you
think love you? Nope, you’re adopted. Why don’t
you do yourself and society a big favour and go
jump in the Thames. No-one will care.
Capricorn
You have a confession
to make, and it involves
a girl called Beresford.
You think that
dangling your penis
through her letter box
late one night will impress her. You couldn’t have
been more wrong. Her Staffordshire Bull Terrier
has a problem with the postman, so the outcome
of your penis was a foregone conclusion. However
on the plus side, you got a pity date. Pint?
Sagittarius
So your department
took down their model
answers to past papers
because the lectures
are too fucking bone
idle to bother about
thinking up new questions. WELL FUCK YOU.
It’s never going to work as the model answers will
always be found from someone in the older years
and distributed about the whole department. I
hope you die from materials overexposure.
Cancer
I feel that since the
sad demise of the
ray of sunshine that
is Jade Goody this
Horoscope should be
hers for evermore.
After all, never in my life have I seen such a
chavvy-looking pikie mother-fucker. If they do
[God fucking please NO] make a film about
her worthless inept life please tell me, and hand
me a knife so I can kill myself.
Gemini
This week you decide
that the usual casual
racism will not sit
with your new cool
kid image. Walking
back one night you
stroll into a Turkish babbie joint and racially
abuse all the staff. Touché. However I feel that
the presence of the Five-O fucked you over a
wee bit and the resultant criminal record will
hamper your ability to actually get a job.
Leo
You’ve been in the
library for so long
that you are starting
to halousinate.
You look around
and everyone has
suddenly aged, growing so much ‘facial hair’
that they could all be Hagrid, but in fact it’s just
a ‘revision beard’. Here’s a tip, a few random
pubes on your face does not constitute a beard.
FACT! Get rid of it you muppit!
Aries
You and your
boyfriend are trying
for a baby. I hope.
If not how else can
you explain the need
to go for a session in
an ‘empty room?’. It was most unfortunate that
a couple of builders walked in on your mo-
ment of passion, disrupting the whole thing.
You disgust me... in fact I have a little bit of
vom in my mouth.
Pisces
This week you will
play a bit of mixed
football. After a bit
of rumble-tumble
you take an unusual
attraction to a long
haired male on the apposing team. After a few
beers that night you are bish-bash-boshing it
on the lawn. Well. I say lawn, really I mean the
middle of a football field in clear view of every-
one. You is classy love!
Aquarius
As a last gasp blow
out before our exams
you decide to lash
it up in Germany.
Unfortunately for you
after a big night out
on the town you wake up in the morning feeling
not so good. Fearless, you power on with your
day. A trip to town sees four vomits, the winner
being in the middle of the busy town square,
into a bin, with the Rozzers driving past. Nice.
