A new species of dinosaur, Dragonus
pyromanicus, has been discovered by
researchers on the Isle of Wight. Den-
tal evidence showed that a specimen
previously thought to be an Eoraptor
was a previously unclassified genus of
the Ornithischian order.
Radiometric dating techniques re-
cently developed at the University of
Bristol showed that the species lived
well into the Holocene, outlasting all
other species by 65 million years. It
is not clear why the species survived
the Cretaceous Tertiary mass extinc-
tion that is thought to have caused the
extinction of all dinosaurs. Some esti-
mates obtained from IridiumII/Iridiu-
mIII ratios place that date as little as
2.5Kya, or about 500 years BC.
Notable on the specimen are tool
marks on the bones. Researchers origi-
nally thought that the long scratches
were made by tools during excavation,
but closer analysis revealed that the
scratches were coated with a layer of
silica, like the rest of the bones. Elec-
tron micrographs of the scratches re-
veal that they are very well defined,
and do not resemble the more irregu-
lar scratches often found on dinosaur
bones from the teeth and claws of
predators of scavengers. A fragment
of iron oxide was also found within the
pelvis. According to Dr. Martin Bunt of
the Natural History Museum the iron
must have been introduced to the skel-
eton prior to burial.
Palaeontologists have struggled to
explain apparent scorch marks on the
teeth of the dinosaur. Professor Mark
Allison of Imperial College London
postulated that strong calcification of
teeth can only be explained by expo-
sure of the growing teeth to prolonged
and intense heat. “The only possible
source of the heat, as I see it, is inter-
nal, it almost seems as if the pyromani-
cus breathed fire”.
Researchers are struggling to find the
cause of death of D. pyromanicus. The
bones show none of the telltale signs of

aging, such as poorly healed fractures
of tumours that are often found asso-
ciated with dinosaurs that died of old
age. The tool marks and iron found on
the bones has led Dr. Peter Sutton, of
Imperial College London to suggest a
human cause of death. Allison points
out that the dinosaur lived well into the
iron age, when the Isle of Wight was
known to have been populated by peo-
ple possessing the relevant knowledge
for the production of iron weapons.
According to Allison, D. pyromanicus
may be the first example of an extinc-
tion caused directly by man.
Physics students nominated
for Nobel Prize this year
Students from the Department of
Physics at Imperial College have been
working on a project in an attempt to
identify the problem with the latest
class of Photon Torpedo’s. The study
is part of their third year group project
and has led to their work being short
listed for the Nobel Physics Prize this
year.
The students from the Physics de-
partment have discovered that a phe-
nomena known as “Long Anti Matter
Exposure” has been causing problems
with the detonation device in the tor-
pedo, hence making it difficult for any
destruction. In order to study the ef-
fect in more detail, they have built their
own torpedo and have been closely
monitoring the “Long Anti Matter Ex-
posure” factor.
Over the past six months they have
had the torpedo locked safely in the
basements of Blackett next to the small
particle collider under heavy guard,
due to fears that members of the secret
organisation, ‘Junior Officers of the
Hudya Nikabolokov
Foreign Correspondent
Klingon Empire’ wanting to steal it.
Problems, however, arose when the
collider was in use which led to an in-
teraction between the anti-matter in
the torpedo and the collider. The out-
come was the creation of a small worm
hole in the basement which has led
to several long haired, black-clothed,
greasy creatures appearing in the Phys-
ics Department.
A spokesman from the Physics de-
partment told felix that “We believe
that the incident that occurred in the
basements of Blackett was an act of
sabotage, our biggest fear is that it is a
‘Junior Officers of the Klingon Empire’
attack.”
Nevertheless, the resulting creation
of the worm hole, whether it was in-
tentional or not, has led to the students
being nominated for the prestigious
award. The results are to be announced
in Stockholm later this year in front of
the King and Queen of Sweden.

Scientists from around the world con-

to take part in the Ig Nobel 2009
Roadshow.
The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual
award given out every October, the
same time as the Nobel Prizes, to re-
search that makes people think about
the sciences. Commenting on the 2006
awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of An-
nals of Improbable Research, cospon-
sor of the awards, said: “The prizes
are intended to celebrate the unusual,
honour the imaginative - and spur
people’s interest in science, medicine
and technology.”

lights include Fiona Barclay who cre-
ated the Periodic Table table.
A rather surprising entry into this
years award came from Imperial Col-
lege Union who entered a paper on
lager. The study investigated under
how many different brands they could
market the same lager under in the
Union Bars before arousing any sort of
suspicion. It was found that they could
market up to eight different brands, in-
cluding one brand of wheat beer and
one non-alcoholic brand. The beer that
everyone has in fact been drinking is a
special brand from Kentucky’s finest
brewery, however the Union refuses to
release the name of the brewer.
Other highlights for 2009 include
proof that dog fleas jump higher than
cat fleas and that our perception of
crisp-crunchiness is influenced by
sound-effects.

Y
ou are doomed. Everyone
who shakes your hand,
passes you in the street,
or even spies on you from
a distance may give you
swine flu. I don’t need to tell you that
performing fellatio on pigs is not a wise
idea (The Food Editor might stop, if
they fly away).
There are quite a number of other
things that are likely to kill you before
you manage to disappoint your parents
by failing your exams and re-taking
the year. The food at the Union, TER-
RORISTS!, boredom in da Vinci’s, the
level of cringe in dBs and that guy in
the Union Bar that graduated in 1978.
Something that won’t kill you is Hang-
man, so do chill out, just a little.
As you may have deduced, Hang-
man has returned. The last time that
felix had the honour of Hangman’s
presence was in the Winter term and
we caused quite a shit storm. Some of
humour it would seem is not appropri-
ate for the eyes of some Imperial stu-
dents. We had considered telling these
certain people to do something sexual
to their mothers but instead we did it
ourselves. In any case, we will avoid the
sort of crass humour that offended and
we hope you will enjoy our offerings.
Well enough bullshit. Union enter-
tainments have fallen squarely into the
cross-hairs of the Hangman team so
look forward to next week’s Hangman
Union ents special. In the mean time,
here’s a preview of next week’s inter-
view with the Union’s Supper Happy
Fun-Times Officer (she’s in charge of
making you smile):

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

would rather say “can anyone else
be bothered to do these?” as I am
getting rather peeved with them.

So which London tube station sums to 102?
This week’s texts:
_ _ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

How to play:
Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in
which cells in a grid have to be colored or
left blank according to numbers given at the
side of the grid.
In this puzzle type, the numbers measure
how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares
there are in any given row or column. For ex-
ample, a clue of “4 8 3” would mean there are
sets of four, eight, and three filled squares,
in that order, with at least one blank square
between successive groups.
So it’s revision time and here at felix we are
providing you with as much material we can
possible think of to make sure you all have
enough stuff to get you through the tedious
revision hours.
The Nonogram will count towards the
FUCWIT League, which means the same
rules apply. Send your answers in to the usu-
al address sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Answers will be revealed next week. Good
luck!
