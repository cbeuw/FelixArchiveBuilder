efore you can even think
about what festivals
you’re planning to go to
this summer, Camden
Crawl creeps up on us
for some springtime fun.
We all love music, and we all love
discovering new bands. This makes
the Camden Crawl (24th
- 25th
April)
the perfect place to enjoy the very
best of what London’s up and com-
ing music scene has to offer. A quick
tube ride away and you’re in Cam-
den High Street, home of London’s
‘alternative’ music scene. Right on
our doorstep, you don’t need to get
a train back home, so you can stay
until four in the morning to party.
Yay!
Camden Town is full of great
clubs and bars, with a music style
sure to cater to you. Weather it be
Indie, Trance, Electro, Punk, Rock,
Folk or anything else you can think
of!
Firstly, collect your wristband.
A simple affair, you hand in your
ticket and are rewarded with a plas-
tic wristband, a map, and a booklet
containing information on every
band playing (over 150!). Person-
ally I was like “FUCK YEAH” to
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and thusly my
companions and I queued up at the
MTV stand to get an extra wrist-
band for this for an hour and a half!
Luckily, the sunny weather and ice
cream van made this bearable.
In Camden, the fun starts early;
the afternoons were filled with
plenty of live bands performing in
small pubs with great atmosphere.
Of particular note were the King
Blues, who seemed to be playing
everywhere (including the MySpace
Bus). We saw them at the Island
Records 50th birthday party at the
Constitution Pub. However, to get
to this pub we had to take a boat
ride. Fun, but I’m sure unnecessary.
After spending the afternoon in
a pub drinking, it was the general
consensus that food at the Camden
Lock would be great. This legendary
place is home to food from all over
the world, being practically thrown
in your face. The Food Editor who
accompanied me suddenly decided
to visit the infamous shop, Cyber-
dog. OMFG this place is WEIRD!
I’ve been before and love how cool
the place is, and the music that is
played there, but let’s be honest, the
people working there look like third
generation freaks. It scares me. Ah
well, time to drink.
When it came to the evenings, it
was time to see some real bands!
The highlight for the first day was, of
course, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Man
that chick is cool... and hot. I’ll tell
you who else was awesome though:
Datarock. They were so camp and
full of energy, much like the Food
Editor Afonso Campos. After the
partying of Day One, it was time to
rest and head on to Day Two.
The second day was even better
than the first, with awesome bands
like the The Computers, being a lot
of fun. But the steal of the show was
definitely the amazing DJ set from
Count + Sinden. I’ve never been
so sweaty in my life, raving to their
hard core Drum & Bass as well as
sick Dub Step tunes.
The Camden Crawl is a definite
must for students. With a weekend
ticket costing only £60, it’s some-
thing that should definitely not be
missed next year!

A students guide to wine
into a glass, you’ll find it’s possible to
accomplish this without too much of
a judder. All in all, wine is a drunkard
student’s best friend.
As utopian a symbiotic relation-
ship with wine it is that I describe,
there comes a point that ‘drinkability’
becomes a less compelling factor. In
short, you realise that you’re one of (a)
a ponce, (b) old, (c) rich or (d) orally
fixated. At this point wine becomes a
rather more fascinating subject. You
literally find yourself reading the wine
articles in the Guardian magazine.
What could possibly drive one to such
despicable extremes?
Depends whom you ask, really. To the
French (who are usually fairly convinc-
ing in matters of the taste-buds) a wine
is its personality. It has to be a strong
personality: recognisable and in a clear
tradition. To many an Australian, wine
is a commercial product, which can be
done badly or well and they don’t put
too much stock in the Old World voo-
doo. To many an American, a wine is
as good as it is big -- high alcohol, high
concentration and served in a nice big
heavy bottle.
Well, whatever the motivation, differ-
ent wines do taste different and where
you have differences, you have differ-
ences of opinion. Noticing these differ-
ences can be great fun. If you’re a fan
of white, try the following experiment.
Get a friend. Go to the bar. One of you
get a glass of Chardonnay (oaked if pos-
sible) and the other get a glass of Sau-
vignon Blanc. Swap the glasses about a
bit so you don’t know which is which.
Swirl the liquid in the glass a bit. Taste
them both making sure to smell while
you drink. These two grapes usually
produce wines which are poles apart:
one of them will be more neutral, tast-
ing of melons, apricots, possibly a little
butter or vanilla, depending on how it’s
made -- that’ll be the Chard. The other
will taste of grapefruit, elderflower,
passionfruit, possibly a little cat’s piss
if you know that smell or even B.O. --
that’ll be the Sauvignon.
It’s fascinating isn’t it? The recipe
after all is essentially the same: grape
juice left to go bad. But what’s your
favourite? Once you can answer that
question, you’re half way there. And
once you’re over the threshold, the
possibilities are endless. A wine is af-
ter all a function of a huge number of
parameters: grape variety, soil com-
position, total rainfall, total sunshine,
ripeness of grapes at harvest, wine-
making techniques including optional
secondary fermentation, lees-stirring,
oak ageing, bottle ageing… the list is
endless.
The result: you have every taste from
chocolate pudding to smoky bacon
crisps to tinned asparagus to treacle
tart with custard. All you’ve got to do
is think about what you’re drinking
(and possibly spend a little more than
3.99 - say 4.99 to start with - see how
you go).
Here are some cheap but good sug-
gestions from the best place which is
close and cheap: Waitrose.
I
’d tried the stuff before being
an undergrad, of course, but
the main use of wine in social
situations was, as far as I and my
friends were concerned, the op-
timising choice of parameter for a pay-
off function of drunkedness with con-
straints on time, cost and maximum
disgustingness of the intoxicant.
Beer didn’t really cut it: you can try
to get drunk on beer if you like (and
many do employ this method to great
effect), but you are fundamentally lim-
ited on volume. The human stomach
can take two pints. Even if you can cue
up a third somewhere else in the sys-
tem, at a paltry 5% alcohol you need at
least two hours of fairly committed ef-
fort to get (un)acceptably sloshed.
Spirits are a step too far, though.
Large amounts of gin, for instance, are
notoriously bad for emotional stability:
next time you’re around a(nother) girl
give her loads of gin and see what hap-
pens. To reach a tolerable level of drink-
ability in Scotch, you need to spend at
least twenty quid a bottle, then you’ll
only end up giving most of it away and
regret the whole sordid affair the next
day with the feeling that someone had
pumped mercury into your ears while
you slept. And whatever anyone tells
you, vodka is disgusting.
With wine on the other hand, a bottle
can be polished off within about fifteen
minutes -- then it’s simply a matter of
fine-tuning. There’s also the downabil-
ity factor: if you find yourself invited to
‘save the queen’ (a penny) when tossed

A
nother term, another
rampage of food sections
to keep you well-fed
and your tummy happy
through a period that
cannot be easy on any self-respecting
Imperial student who wants to come
back to university by the end of a glo-
rious fun-filled summer. Sometimes
I catch myself thinking that I am not
that student, and that with something
resembling a frail certainity, I might ac-
tually be that kid you heard about once
who got kicked out for failing his ex-
ams. Immediately, upon this thought, I
get up, look at my books and fall into a
deep hatred of mathematics and phys-
ics, and gracefully recommence this
cycle of pathetic self-loathing that is
not the most conducive to effective
study.
I do not help myself in this aspect one
bit though. This easter holiday, I decid-
ed shun revision for a while and go to
New York City for about one week, and
foodies, let me tell you, what a holiday
that was. Not only did I venture there
with some great friends, despite the
food experience not being everyone’s
favourite gourmet extravaganza, it was
without the shadow of a doubt, a por-
nographic feast for my palate and taste
buds. None of it was guilt-free and I
must have put on more weight than I
care to think about, but it was worth
every gram and every cent. Two dining
experiences stick out however.
The first one, was right before a Ra
Ra Riot gig at Webster Hall. We were
taken to an incredibly small estab-
lishment that goes by the name of
Artichoke. There was a small queue
forming outside, and inside there was
no seating area and just barely enough
space to order what was described to
me as New York City’s best slice of
pizza. These gigantic pieces not only
filled me up, but were without a doubt
worthy of the hype. If you are in the
City soon, please, do yourself a favour
and indulge in these blasphemously
delicious slices (artichoke and spinach
recommended).
The other restaurant was something
unlike anything I have tried before.
Foodswing’s, a vegan joint in Wil-
liamsburg, Brooklyn. Despite walls
covered in the usual hippie PETA
propaganda and lies, the food was
shockingly good and interesting. Bacon
cheeseburgers, milkshakes and cheesy
fries are not exactly the kind dishes
one would expect at a place where the
thought of even touching an animal is
enough to sicken the waiter. Through
clever use of tofu and flavourings, we
were presented with something that
non only resembled meat, it tasted
quite similar if not oddly better. The
buffalo faux-chicken wings were to die
for and the peanut-butter ‘milk’shake
was galactic. Try these if you go.
