THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13
14.11.2014
FELIX
would
er do?
in the back of my head, but I thought
I wouldn’t be able to take 2 weeks out
of studying. I was concerned about
my degree and putting too much
pressure on my friends.
But when I did ask my friends,
the support I got was absolutely
overwhelming. Seeing my friends
pull through like they did was one of
the greatest things to happen to me
during my time at Imperial.
I didn’t expect for a second that
they would do anything like that
for me. The good stuff that they did
helping me impressed me so much; it
almost outshone the fact that I won
the election.
B: Why President?
T: It’s a weird one. I’m from a clubs
background and I’d been asked if
I considered running for DPCS. I
think it was the fact that the things
I wanted to achieve were not clubs
based, but what I wanted to try and
change was the wider relationship
College has with students. College
perceives students as customers
and the transactional perception
of how education is viewed upsets
me; students are seeing education
as a way to get a higher salary in
the future. I think students should
be more like members rather than
customers and College should
have to engage with the students
more when making changes to the
education they are providing. An
example of this is moving Chemistry
to Imperial West: where students
were asked what they want and
College is actually doing what they
want.
B: But how can this aim even be
achieved? I thought all you could
do was put forward the student
opinion?
T: The thing my predecessor, David,
taught me (and what Paul taught
him) was that things don’t get
decided in meetings. Things get
‘approved’ in meetings, but things get
formulated outside and that’s where
influence comes in. As President I
have the most amount of influence
of the sabbs because I can have
meetings with very high up people
(like the President and Provost of
the College) and hopefully influence
people’s opinion on how they
perceive students as an organisation,
and ideas will then hopefully trickle
down. I can agree that at the end of
the year, there will be little perceived
change. I know things won’t change
overnight, I’m a realist like that, but
I think there will be visible change in
about five years’ time.
B: Do you think you can be held
accountable at the end of this year?
T: I hope so. A couple of things I
want to achieve are like that; long-
standing changes in attitude, which
aren’t quantifiable. But I also want
to campaign around the time of
general elections to change student
engagement in politics. The student
voter turnout is about 20% and the
national turnout is 40% but the
elderly turnout is 70%. The current
attitude is: why should politicians
listen to students when they get
more votes from the elderly? I think
we need to do something about
that. I think we should have a lot
more political weight. And since the
election’s in May, hopefully I will be
able to say more quantifiable things
when it comes to accountability.
B: Do you think student body
should be given a vote to decide the
quality of job you’ve done?
T: We haven’t spoken about this
as a sabb team yet since Chris
brought this up. My individual
opinion is that if we ask for a
student referendum whether we get
Honorary life membership at the
end of the sabbatical year, students
are more likely to pay attention to
the negative things that the person
has done and they are more likely to
vote if they dislike the person.
I think the students who are voting,
if they are interested and want to
hold us to account, they should come
to Student Council, which is the
forum to hold us accountable. I don’t
think a cross-campus ballot would
be as representative of an informed
opinion. Council is designed for the
Sabbs to give a balanced report about
what they’ve done and for their
actions to be questioned by students.
I do think the majority of people who
would vote in the ballot would not
go all the way to make an informed
decision.
It’s quite a controversial thing to
say, but I don’t think there would
be that level of engagement. I know,
because I’ve done a lot of surveys
without having done enough
research beforehand to be wholly
informed about an issue.
B: Other than changing college
attitudes, what other issues would
you like to tackle?
T: The general election stuff I
mentioned before, and the national
movement on ‘lad culture’, which
is a title I absolutely detest. It’s not
representative of the issue and it is
inherently gender specific. A lot of
research indicates there are a lot of
women participating in it too. ‘Lad
culture’ is defined as ‘homophobic,
and generally misogynistic and/or
racist behaviour amongst groups who
in general have been drinking and/or
participating in a sport’.
Giving it a gender specific title is
going to exacerbate the issue, both
genders should be approached,
saying ‘we need to stop this’. We are
looking at branding it as a part of the
solution, we are working on coming
up with a new title for it.
Another issue I want to look at is
Evelyn Gardens. They’re definitely
closing next year for refurbishment,
but then the following year, there
might be some opportunity to push
College to keep them open, because
they still have a 30 year lease left.
They are such an asset!
B: Will the rent increase though?
T: Absolutely, because College had to
pay so much to refurbish them. But
with Acton, by the time you’ve paid
for a travel card, total cost is going
to be the same as the refurbished
Evelyn Gardens. But at least Evelyn
Gardens is closer, quicker and nicer.
Tying in with this, another issue
I want to look at is the affordable
living cost. Currently Imperial
can’t afford to give bursaries to the
‘middle income’ students, an issue
that I am particularly concerned
about. So we’re trying to collate some
data; asking students how much their
parents give them monthly, and
where they are spending that money,
so then we can better inform College
about living costs.
B: In your role of President, who is
accountable to you?
T: Our predecessors have changed
the previous structure: I am now not
in charge of the other sabbs, because
they were elected for their separate
reasons, and it’s less democratic. The
Manager of the Union reports to me,
technically.
B: So you’re like the ‘CEO of the
Union’?
T: Yep.
B: Who trained you?
T: We get training throughout
the induction period in the last
two weeks of July. I also attended
Students Union conferences, about
how to run a student union. I also
got a handover from David, and
also have open dialogue with past
presidents.
B: How do you think David did last
year?
T: I think David did a very good job.
I think the most impressive thing
he produced was a consultation
framework about how presidents
should engage with students, it offers
kinds of rules and framework on
when they need to speak to students
and how much, improving student
consultation.
B: What is the thing you most like
and dislike about the Union?
T: The thing I most like is that we’re
so student-led. One of the downsides
is that students sometimes get
frustrated with certain aspects, like
they don’t like queuing too long at
the bars and they don’t like paying
entry into the Union. Entry fees are
a contentious issue, but it’s free til
9pm and it’s £2 after. But all of this
money is re-invested to the Union,
which goes towards the students.
B: If you had to have tinder, what
bio would you have?
T: Oh God knows. I’d probably put
what I like to do, so: skiing, climbing
and that kind of thing. I’d probably
put how tall I am, some girls get put
off about how tall I am!
B: How tall are you?
T: *no hesitation* 6 foot 3. That
really caught me unaware, I wonder
what IS on my tinder profile…
B: Okay, say your tinder bio WAS
actually amazing-
T: What ‘WAS amazing?!’, are you
saying it’s crap?!
B: -and successfully earned you a
date but because you are so busy
with all your sabb duties, you don’t
have time to leave campus, and
have to have your first date at an
Imperial establishment. Where do
you go?
T: On campus?! Crippling! I’m
technically a postgrad, half staff
member, so probably h-bar.
