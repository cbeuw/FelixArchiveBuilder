SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for some mistakes in
Issue 1587. These were:
- We misprinted Belly Dancing
society’s email. Their correct
address is:
bellydancing@imperial.ac.uk
This week we’re reporting on
Imperial College Union’s
penalties against the various
rugby teams, the confusion over the
Silwood redevelopment plans and
the fallout from this week’s Union
Council meeting.
The Council meeting ran on for
an impressive three hours, and was
divided into two parts; the main bulk
was discussing the papers submitted
by the Sabbatical officers and some
of the Council members, whilst the
second part was a discussion on how
to combat anti-social behaviour in
societies.
Despite this discussion being
insightful, this topic as a whole needs
to move beyond the walls of Council,
and beyond the same group of people
who, despite, in theory representing
the majority of the student body, are
very much a select minority of the
student population as a whole.
The Higher Education Funding
policy is attracting a lot more
attention than this discussion.
Although Tom Wheeler has claimed
that “yob culture” is something he
wants to tackle, nothing is being said
about how to further investigate
drinking culture in clubs and the
negative effects this may have.
A General Meeting has been called
to finalise the Higher Education
Funding policy, which requires 200
students to attend and vote on the
policy before it is passed. However,
why is anti-social behaviour being
seemingly relegated whilst so many
people seem to have to be consulted
over a policy that, in reality, may
actually have little effect?
The policy, once decided upon, will
provide a foundation upon which
the Union will lean when it comes
to ‘lobbying’ parliament. What
this lobbying entails has yet to be
mentioned.
Whether parliament will even
listen is a completely separate
story. Yet hours of discussion is
being dedicated to this topic, whilst
addressing issues that are affecting
the students currently at Imperial
is being pigeonholed into informal
discussions that aren’t widely
publicised.
Back over at College, the decision
to change bursaries also seemed to
have little discussion that involved
students. With Tom given such a
small window to investigate what
students may feel about the proposed
changes, and the deadlines for the
window set by the print deadline
of next year’s prospectus no less,
it seems again that topics that
should be openly challenged and
debated are being hastily pushed
through. Meanwhile, others that
are being allocated hours and hours
of debate are likely to be rather
inconsequential.
This brings us nicely to the Silwood
confusion. We spoke to a number of
people, all passionate about the work
that happens at Silwood, and yet all
uncertain as to what to think of the
plans.
Luckily, the petition is facilitating
debate that could have an impact
if no formal decisions have been
made yet, and hopefully the
redevelopments that may happen
will be advantageous to everyone.
Relevant discussion is better
sooner rather than later, and this
is something both the Union and
College needs a gentle reminder of
once in a while.
