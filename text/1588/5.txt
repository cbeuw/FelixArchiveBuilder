Felix spoke to the Estates Team,
who said they too had no more
information that was concrete at
this moment in time. Upon contact-
ing Vincent Savolainen, Professor of
Organismic Biology who is based at
Silwood, he explained to us that the
operation of Silwood is split between
the parts of the campus in use and
the College Endowment, which takes
assets from College once they are
no longer of use. They then look to
obtain “best value” for these assets,
which are then reinvested back into
the College.
Properties currently under control
by College Endowment include the
Manor house alongside some of the
other buildings on site.
Said Savolainen, “It is now
reviewing plans to redevelop the
Manor House. The College will
ensure that the Silwood Community,
including students, are briefed once
we have any further information.”
Vincent Savolainen led a meeting
last Tuesday at Silwood to address
any questions students had, and
then emailed the students to answer
any further issues. They reiterated
that the plans are to take place over
a number of years, and there will be
no disturbance during exams.
They also explained “Any parts
developed as housing would likely
be fenced off… The College is
absolutely committed to the use of
Silwood Park as a field facility and
the green spaces are protected by
local planning.”
However, some remained
unconvinced. Said one student: “It
seemed that the staff didn’t know
what was going on, although this
may be because they too don’t have
any definite answers.”
“We have been left with a feeling
of helplessness. We feel that because
many students at Silwood are only
here for a year and the plans may
not be put into place for so long, we
don’t really have a leg to stand on.
“We are in the middle of nowhere,
but now we can’t enjoy our campus
if people are living on the site as
rented tenants.”
Nika Levikov, a taught
postgraduate that is now in her
second year at Imperial, started the
petition that is looking to amass 500
signatures.
She told Felix that she was
initially concerned when the
students were informed the Manor
House was being sold, and then
rumours began to spread about
further redevelopment.
The petition, hosted on change.org,
is targeted at Simon Harding-Roots,
the Chief Operations Officer, who
oversees the Estates team, which
includes Estates Master planning
and Development, Estates Projects,
and Estates facilities, as well as
Campus Services.
The petition states that “Right
now this campus is threatened by
infrastructure development that
would close off these areas to all
students and staff (including the
basketball court). To Silwoodians,
both past and present, think about
what we could lose and what would
be left for future students. Sign the
petition to keep Silwood beautiful!”
Said Levikov, “I received
information from a source I’m
unable to disclose here that
management is planning to
declassify Green Belt land and sell
it so that areas, like the Japanese
Gardens, will be destroyed and
turned into public housing.

“I felt having this information was
enough to go public with a warning
to all Silwoodians about what kind
of plans are being discussed in the
hopes that management would
begin a dialogue with students.
“Otherwise I feared that plans
would be confirmed and land sold
before students had the chance to
react.”
She went on to tell Felix that she
would like to start a dialogue with
the management over potential
plans. “I think students who have
worked so hard to come to study at
a university like Imperial have the
right to know what is being planned
since they are all directly impacted
by any kind of development.
Destroying nature for profit is not
an option.
“Tim sent an email to all Silwood
students reassuring them that
redevelopment is not for that
purpose. If this is the case, then
students should be told clearly
where the money is going and why it
is needed.”
Levikov was unable to attend the
meeting Vincent held since she is
currently based abroad.
Felix also spoke to Matt Jones,
a PhD student based at Silwood
and currently the Silwood Park
Union Chair. He confirmed that the
information available at this stage is
very vague, but the land will be used
to generate revenue in the future.
“For Silwood to be sustainable,
it needs to generate revenue, and
currently land is being under
utilised. Whilst it would be sad to
lose a lot of it, compromise has to
be made.
“The problem is, we don’t actually
know what land we are planning to
sell off. They showed us a rough map
but in no way is it finalised.
“There are always rumours
at Silwood. Why they are now
having these meetings is because
they realise the rumours are more
damaging than that is actually
happening.”
He explained that he has been
invited to a meeting in then near
future with the Silwood staff and the
Estates team, to discuss the plans
further.
“Tim [Barraclough, an academic
at Silwood and colleague of Vincent]
has gone into the effort of answering
people’s individual questions,
although I can’t say if it will be a
shift in opinions [of other students].
“Some people are always going to
stick to their initial opinions, but
hopefully we are now opening up a
dialogue between the students and
the people planning this.”
It seems for now that there are
no definitive plans for the site,
but many questions still remain
unanswered. Felix will report on
updates as they come in.
