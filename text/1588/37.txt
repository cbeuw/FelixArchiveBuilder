RAG goes wild: Jailbreak team
After 5 hours of nervous sleep
and a night spent discussing
almost military tactics,
myself, Sophie Johnston and Will
Daubney waited in Beit Quad for
09:00 to pass with trepidation.
At this point in our journey, we
were still undecided about which
plan of action would be best to
follow; we were weighing up either
raising enough money to take £32
flights to Antalya, Turkey at 18:15
or hitchhiking across the English
Channel and getting as far away
from London as possible by car. We
were well aware of the pros and cons
for both; to get a flight to Turkey
we would not only have had to raise
£96 for flights, but also find a way to
get to Gatwick in time for the 18:15
flight and pay for a £20 visa each to
allow us access to the country. Despite
being an extremely attractive option,
the cold indifference of London gave
us pause for thought of this plan’s
feasibility. Getting across the Channel
also had its own troubling risks: where
to hitchhike from? How difficult
would it be? Would we be safe? Even
after discussing late into the night, we
sat squarely on a fragile fence.
With no set plan in mind, we set
off in the direction of Victoria to test
the water and ascertain how generous
a city London truly is, with a heavy
cynicism hanging over us. We were
pleasantly surprised with how willing
people were to give us money, but
it soon became apparent that their
generosity was not enough and
raising the necessary money would
be too risky a venture indeed. After
raising £15, we called it quits and
headed for pastures green.
After looking at the tangled, busy
London roads in front of us we
identified a large obstacle that we
hadn’t yet considered: hitching a lift
to the South-East from the centre
would be hard in a city where traffic
is headed in every direction. Very
hard. After a quick Google, we found
a helpful site called hitchwiki that
informed us that the best way to get
to the Southeast was to take a train
from Charing Cross to Mottingham,
walk to a nearby Shell garage on the
entrance of the A20 and hitch a lift
from there. So, with a train to catch
in mind, we started a brisk walk to
Charing Cross station.
As we got on the train, Will had an
unexpected phone-call. The 3 Stooges
had already gotten to the Eurotunnel.
For a moment we sat aghast at how
far behind we were already. Before
we had even left London, they could
potentially already be on their merry
way to Calais. We seethed.
After our train deposited us in
Mottingham, we power-walked our
way to the Shell garage and lay in
ambush for likely victims driving to
Folkstone, where the Channel Tunnel
is located.
After 45 minutes of springing
ourselves on unsuspecting drivers, we
had success with a history teacher that
was driving towards Folkstone to visit
his mother. Our first successful hitch
was pure exhilaration, which must
have surely come across as we eagerly
thanked our generous chauffeur.
Our chauffeur, whose name we
promptly forgot, dropped us off at
a service station near the outskirts
of Maidstone and kindly wished
us farewell after a drawn out
conversation about Ireland and the
London housing market.
No sooner had we arrived at the
service station, Will received another
unexpected phone-call, but this one
good. The 3 Stooges had been briefly
arrested for trying to hitchhike across
the Channel Tunnel whilst on the
property’s car park. The 3 Stooges
were rapidly losing their lead, and
we finally had news to celebrate. Not
only was the phone call celebratory,
it was also informative: we now knew
not to attack the Channel Tunnel
head on, so instead we began to cruise
the car park for cars heading across
the Channel. This plan was easier said
than done, and became a lot more
difficult when another bombshell hit.
Despite RAG’s forward planning,
Warwick University was also doing
a Jailbreak that day, which we found
to our dismay as two other groups
arrived on the scene and started
competing for lifts. An urgent race
covered by a thin veil of camaraderie
ensued.
During our passive-aggressive
scrambling for a car, a nice Belgian
gave us €20 to cover costs when we
crossed the border, further affirming
my belief in the kindness of strangers.
It’s not every day that a group of
three friends set off into entirely
unknown territory,but last
Saturday,three poised Jailbreak
teams ran out of the Beit Quad
and into a 24-hour adventure.
Jailbreak is a competition
where teams aim to get as far
away from their University
as possible (as the crow flies)
without spending any of their
own money.This type of charity
fundraising event gains more
and more popularity year on year
as news flies out about teams
that get to far flung destinations
like New Zealand,Singapore
and California: all within 24-36
hours.In times where a mere
train journey to Edinburgh will
take a hefty chunk out of your
bank balance,travelling to the
corners of the globe for free is a
commendable feat.
So,with baited breath and
fingers crossed for success,
Imperial RAG organized its first
Jailbreak to take place on the 1st
of November with the help of
the event’s chosen charity,East
Africa Playgrounds.
Three intrepid teams signed
up for the task: RAGdollz,The
3 Stooges and The Prisoners.
In total,the teams travelled
1150km,with the winning
team (RAGdollz) travelling an
impressive 600km.RAGdollz’s
success was made even more
astounding considering that
they moved from last to first
place in 8 hours: a true testament
to Jailbreak’s exciting dynamism
as a race.
RAGdollz got as far as Dijon,
France (598km) and came in
1st place.In 2nd place came
The Prisoners,who got as far as
Plymouth (304km) and in 3rd
place came The 3 Stooges who,
despite being first across the
Channel only got as far as Lille,a
mere 245km away.
After the success of this
Jailbreak,RAG is now planning a
second one for the Spring term.
