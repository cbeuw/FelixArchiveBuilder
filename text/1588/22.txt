The Summer Ball 2015
You choose the theme!
The Union is currently preparing for The Summer
Ball 2015 and we need your help to choose a
theme.
We went ‘Down the Rabbit Hole’ for The
Summer Ball 2014 and the whole campus
was transformed into a fantastical Alice in
Wonderland.
We listened to what you had to say about the
ball in the our last survey and picked the five
most popular themes you wanted to see at the
next ball.
Vote now for what theme you would like to see
at The Summer Ball 2015!
