Wounded: Is This War’s True Legacy?
Iwas a bit apprehensive of this new
exhibition at Somerset House. I
feared it might just be an attempt
for Bryan Adams, the photographer,
to try and reinvent himself, having
been a washed up pop star for so
long. Moreover, the advertising
made it seem like just another one
of those populist exhibitions, raking
in plenty of publicity for Somerset
House without actually having much
substance. But it has got a lot of
attention and will surely be popular,
especially seeing that it opened just
after Remembrance Day, ensuring
people are still caught up in an
emotional frenzy stirred up by our
nationalistic media.
Unfortunately, it was just as I
expected. The bandying around of
“modern-day heroes” and “band of
brothers”, such emotive phrases,
gives you an idea of the tone of the
show, not attempting to say “never
again”, but in fact glorifying the
war, telling us what role models
these brave veterans are. As soon
as you walked into the three-room
exhibition space, you were faced
with a huge photograph not of
the veterans as promised, but of a
Union Jack, torn but still flapping
majestically in the breeze. The
agenda of this exhibition was so
obvious, they might as well have
spelled it out (which they kind of
did in the introduction literature)!
And this one picture pretty much
sums everything up, I don’t even
need to say any more. The exhibition
had absolutely no depth and was
steadfastly sticking to this patriotic
line; it was predictable and utterly
dull.
‘Disabilities serve as a reminder of
the battles beyond combat’ claims
the show but I saw no attempts
to reveal some of the darkness
behind these deformities. Adams
photographs these men with no
context to the horrifying war they
were involved in, with their white
backdrop acting to conceal all of
the horror behind it. Described
by one serviceman as “the most
real depiction of our lives I’ve ever
seen”, I would love to see what every
other disabled veteran would have
to say about that. Yes, it showed
disfigurements that would otherwise
not be seen but that is where
attempts to depict the reality of their
lives ended.
Is that really the reality of their
lives: standing proudly in a blank
room as if they were some kind
of classical statue? What about
the reality of lives torn apart by
disfigurement, of people battling
with depression, PTSD and broken
families; that is the photography I
want to see. All this exhibition does
is tell the same old story, putting
a patriotic façade on an extremely
important issue. Where are the
Lieutenant Dans? I can’t imagine
Adams going down to seedy bars
and strip clubs photographing
the veterans who hate their own
existence, simply because that
doesn’t follow his shallow and
unimaginative narrative. He is
completely warping reality and the
true legacy of war whilst offering
forward no counter narrative of any
authenticity.
And can one call an artwork
effective if it requires a whole script
beside it to explain the story of the
people involved? Isn’t it the job of
Marine Joe Townsend. Feburary 2013. Photographed by Bryan Adams Photo: Bryan Adams
Kamil McClelland explores what remains after Iraq and Afghanistan
their expressions, their positioning,
the setting to tell this story, all the
things that define a photographer’s
quality and something completely
lacking in this showcase?
One photo particularly stayed
with me, and not in a positive
way. It did not show the brutalised
teenager’s young face, just his
mutilated hands alongside his
medals. By directly equating the
injuries with a nationalistic pro-
military stance, Adams is destroying
any vague attempt made to try and
help the viewers gain insight into
the lives of these veterans in any
meaningful way. It is pure and simple
propaganda! And just as ever, there is
no profundity in his works, a simple
man’s attempt to try and make
a comment on the atrocities and
aftermath of war.
In conclusion, yes, this exhibition
may show one aspect of the legacy
of war but both artistically and in
the choice of subject, it does the
war no justice and is an insult to all
those affected by its terror. It hides
as much as it reveals in what ends
up being no more than military
propaganda. Oh how heroic they
were, protecting their country! No
questions asked about was it worth it
and the consequences for the people
of Iraq and Afghanistan. What was
their legacy? Surely much more
horrific than anything on show here
today!
For them, the legacy of war will
last much longer and will have a
much more devastating impact. And
despite the Chief of Defence Staff,
General Sir Nicholas Houghton,
claiming that the primary mission
in Afghanistan has been achieved,
one has to wonder whether there
was really anything achieved for
the people on the ground. This
exhibition makes a mockery of this
true, less palatable legacy.
Wounded: The Legacy of War is on
until 25th January 2015. Free Entry.
The exhibition is accompanied by a
book, published by Steidl, featuring 40
photographs by Bryan Adams, available
for £40. Proceeds from the book goes
to veteran support charities BLESMA,
Blind Veterans UK, Combat Stress,
SSAFA, and War Child
