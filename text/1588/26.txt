Blood Swept Lands: Why do we remember war?

Kamil McClelland examines the role of the Tower of London installation
"Whilst
striking in
its scale ...
it does not
overwhelm
you as it
should."
The UK has been blown over in
support for Paul Cummin’s re-
cent work at the Tower of Lon-
don Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red
to such an extent that the installation,
which began being partly dismantled
on Wednesday, was prolonged until
the end of the month. Moreover, such
was the public reaction that, with the
help of David Cameron himself, some
of the display will be toured around
the country until 2018, after which
it will gain a permanent position in
the London and Manchester Imperial
War Museums.
So yes, this work was hugely
popular and almost everyone that you
speak to found it intensely moving,
especially if they also witnessed
the Roll of Honour of the names of
war dead submitted by the public,
announced at dusk, a particularly
poignant occasion. But is this way of
remembering – a very British way
of remembering – how it should be
done?
This, as with almost all forms of
British war remembrance, focuses on
the victims of the war: the glorious
dead, the heroic veterans, the
women on the home front faithfully
supporting the war effort. And
although this way of remembering
does have its merits, particularly in
the way that it allows very personal
reflection on one’s family ties to
war and death, it doesn’t remember
much of the war itself. The poppy
installation does, to some extent, give
one a sense of the scale of death and
ensures equality in death but it does
not particularly reflect on the reality
of war: the horror, the death, and the
inhumanity.
Visual artists who have managed
this in the past include Otto Dix and
Francisco Goya, both of whom focus
more on the sheer terror and insanity
of the practice. Otto Dix served in
the First World War on the German
side and was deeply traumatised,
suffering recurrent nightmares
of his experiences. Because of
this, his paintings are completely
overwhelmed with terror and fear,
even still after almost one hundred
years. His works are not about
remembrance, they are about war:
real war and why it can never happen
again. Now where is this reality of war
represented in the poppy installation?
It seems now that the number
of people that lived and fought in
the First and Second World Wars
dwindles to next to nothing, the
memories of these everyday horrors
fades with them and we are even
more detached from it. And so, to
ensure these images are passed on,
we rely on art. The memories of
individuals will always be passed on
– I know all about my relative who
died in the First World War – but it
is these other factors that won’t be
passed on because they do not exist in
one’s individual war narrative. Hence,
because of this, we need to change
how we publicly remember war.
So why do we not focus on this?
Why do we not remember first and
foremost so this never happens
again? I think it is because we do not
want to imagine these aspects of war,
not because we necessarily support
war but because we do not want to
imagine someone ever went through
that.
How could you possibly restart
civil society after something like the
horror of the Somme? As people, we
want to remember our friends and
family who died in war as opposed to
the way in which they died; we want
to celebrate their lives as opposed to
dwell on the evils of their death. It is
simply human nature.
Exhibitions like this will always be
popular as they weigh heavily on our
emotions and personal experiences
but they play no role in disgusting
us from war. However, I feel we have
a moral duty to better emphasise
"We have a
moral duty
to more
greatly
emphasise
the horrors
of war."
the horrors of war as opposed to
just focusing on remembrance. For
only then will the numbers 888, 246
actually mean something to us.
The installation at the Tower of
London is, in this respect, indeed
quite heartless and bland. It does not
give us any sense of the experience
of war and I do agree with heavily
criticized Guardian writer Jonathan
Jones in his use of the word
“prettified” to describe how the work
treats war. Also, as a piece of art in its
own right, whilst striking in its scale
and moving in its subject, it does not
overwhelm you as it should.
The piece in itself is not moving,
it is what it represents and how it
was used with a Roll of Honour that
creates emotion. Thus, I feel it failed
quite crucially.
Hence, I feel we remember the
people of war with no regard for
our moral duty to prevent it from
happening again; and it is because
of this, as well as the fundamental
dullness of the Cummin’s
installation, that makes it somewhat
of a disappointment.
Let’s hope we have more memorials
in the future, which do address this
duty of preventing war as opposed to
just glorifying its memory. Then we
wouldn’t need to remember as we do.
