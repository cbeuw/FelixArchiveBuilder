The darker side to student journalism
Arecent article in The Guardian
explored the world of student
journalism, and the often
strained relationship between student
journalists and their Universities and
Student Unions. One such story took
place at Plymouth University last
year, where the Editor faced thinly
veiled threats from their Union, who
would put her degree at risk if she
covered a story about cuts to student
amenities. When trying to run a
story about how University staff had
an all expenses paid trip to Miami,
she was told by the University’s
communications team that they
would rather she didn’t print stories
which portray the University in a bad
light, adding that if she had gotten on
better with the University, perhaps
she could also have gone to Miami.
It was a similar case at Durham
University, when a story about a
controversial appointment of their
new Master of University College
caught the attention of the Union
and University. Their Editor was also
threatened with “serious disciplinary
measures” and the University
demanded to proof read each issue
before publication.
The Ripple at Leicester was delayed
going to print after their Union
threatened to close the paper if a
front page investigation into the
Union’s engagement with students
was not removed from the paper.
It’s only natural that institutions
want to protect their reputation
and image, but these stories show
a worrying trend towards the idea
that they can bend student media
and student journalists to prevent
the publication of critical pieces:
effectively preventing them from
holding their University and Union
to account. As Universities have
grown and expanded their operations,
they look further afield for sources of
funding. In parallel, rises in student
fees means they face increased
competition from rival institutions
to attract students. The number of
TV and tube adverts we see now for
undergraduate degrees epitomises
this change.
These changes have pushed
Universities to act more like large
corporations than they have ever
done before. Image and corporate
communications move up on the
agenda. I don’t blame them for this
– it makes a lot of sense. Image is
important. It is, however, unrealistic
to expect student newspapers and
journalists to not investigate issues
that affect them and their institution,
or are of interest to the University
community. In the rest of the world,
spokespeople for big corporations
will try and quell stories, but have no
way of controlling what is reported.
I fail to see why this should be any
different within a University.
We must stay on the right side
of defamation law (slander and
libel), but this is the case with every
publication. With the right training
and guidance, this is achievable.
I’m proud that we can print without
having our paper scrutinised by an
Officer of Imperial College Union,
or Imperial College London. The
day when we have to submit every
page for review will be a sad day for
quality journalism and free press. As
Professor Michael Bromley, interim
Head of Journalism at City University
said: “This all seems a bit Stalinist to
me”.
