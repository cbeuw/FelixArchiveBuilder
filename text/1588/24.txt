Finding Out What Makes JOHN Tick...
“The normality of life is just
to have someone you can
express stuff with.”
Devised by DV8 Physical Theatre, a
contemporary dance company known
for their original and controversial
work, the atmosphere surrounding
the press night of JOHN was electric.
The production was devised
following a series of interviews
performed on a group of 50 men
regarding the topics of love, sex and
relationships. An interview with one
man in particular, JOHN, proved so
troubled and complex that it inspired
a verbatim work in which his story is
explored.
JOHN’s untypical life makes for a
hard-hitting, fast paced production
that openly confronts complex issues.
Born to a violent father and depressed
mother, his troubled childhood paves
the way for an even more unstable
life.
The opening five minutes alone
involves a cleverly rotating stage
in which actors flicker through
emotional scenes of domestic abuse,
drug addiction, rape, and death. The
use of verbatim speech coupled with
intricate and skillful dance acts to
intensify the emotion, enticing and
rendering the audience silent.
The play follows JOHN as he grows
up, his (numerous) encounters with
the law, and his somewhat confused
personal circumstances. In his later
life, the concepts of male sexuality
are explored, confronting some
important themes: sex, addiction and
man’s search for something in life
– whether love, approval or merely
company.
"What
sets Smith
apart from
others
is his
vision and
fearless
attitude"
"The
striking
picture is
composed
like a
classical
pieta of
old"
Apicture tells a thousand
words, as the old adage goes.
But some of the best photos
go deeper; not satisfied with a word-
limit of a thousand, the photographer
instead expands their range, taking
in entire movements, nations, and
histories with their lens.
One such photo is Tomoko Uemure
in Her Bath, taken by the legendary
American war photographer and
photojournalist W. Eugene Smith in
197. The picture, striking in its black
and white intensity, is composed like
a classical pieta, with Ryoko Uemura
taking on the role of the Virgin Mary,
cradling her daughter Tomoko, whose
mind and body have been withered
away thanks to the debilitating effects
of Minimata disease.
The disease, a form of severe
mercury poisoning that destroys
the nervous system, was affecting
Tokomo due to the pollution released
by the Chisso Corporation, and this
photo helped bring this injustice to
international attention. This is what
photojournalists do best; wielding
their camera, they act as warriors for
truth, unveiling what is happening
and showing it to the waiting world.
But this is not only a great piece
of journalism - it is a great piece of
art. The composition of the shot
is awe-inspiring, with the bathtub
forming a dramatic diamond in
the centre of the frame. The loving
gaze with which Ryoko looks down
at her daughter contrasts with the
look of pain on the girl’s face, which
is drawn back in a silent scream of
anguish. Tomoko’s legs, atrophied so
that they resemble matchsticks, are
supported by her mother’s strong,
firm arms. The lighting, which comes
in from one direction, reflects of the
gently rippling water, creating an
atmosphere of still and calm.
W. Eugene Smith is a paragon
of a photojournalist – his unique
eye, which took in horrific scenes
in Japan, Haiti, Spain, and the US,
is alone enough to place him in the
higher echelons of photographers.
But what sets Smith apart is his
uncompromising vision, and fearless
attitude. In 1972, one year after
this photograph was taken, he was
attacked by employees of the Chisso
Company, in an attempt to silence
him. As a result his vision in one eye
deteriorated, meaning he had to take
a break from his work. It didn’t stop
him; in 1975 he released his essay
Minimata, and continued to release
work up until his death in 1978.
This wasn’t the first time Smith had
faced difficulty: initially working for
Newsweek, he was fired for refusing to
abandon 35mm in favour of medium
format. Joining Life in 1939, he spent
the next six years photographing
conditions in Japan, eventually
being hit by mortar fire. In 1954 he
severed his ties with Life, owing to
their interpretation of his photos of
humanitarian Albert Schweitzer.
This uncompromising attitude,
which earned him a thorny
reputation, also led to his perfectly
composed work. Other pieces, such
as his photo of a demolition team
blasting out a cave in Iwo Jima,
or a US soldier in Saipan finding
a wounded infant, are similarly
shocking in their intensity.
Tomoko Uemere in Her Bath is, for
me, a perfect example of the power
of war photography; its ability to
capture the human condition, in all
its horror, is unrivalled by any other
field.
W. Eugene Smith was unique in
this respect, with his innate ability to
enter into the void and then return –
not only intact, but with pictures that
speak long after their subjects cannot.
War.What is it good for? Edwin
Starr might think it’s absolutely
nothing,but here at Felix Arts we
take a more optimistic view,instead
looking at the artwork that war has
inspired throughout history,from
the Bayeaux Tapestry to modern
photojournalism,in this special
Conflict Issue.
We start off with a look at the iconic
photography of W.Eugene Smith,
and try and unpick exactly what
the role of a photographer is,as
well as the key qualities in a good
photojournalist.Mario Lapore then
take a look at the psychological
conflict present in the tale of JOHN,
whose internal battles are played
out across the stage at the National
Theatre.
What starts out as a review of
Somerset House’s new exhibition
of photographs of ex-servicepeople,
Wounded:LegacyofWar,soon turns
into an exploration of what it
means to remember,and the fine
line between commemoration
and canonisation.This topic is
quite pertinent,especially with the
centenary of WWI occurring this
week.
The relationship between WWI
and the arts has been hitting the
headlines recently,in no small
part thanks to the media storm
surrounding the Tower of London
poppies display,in which a ceramic
poppy has been planted for every
British serviceperson killed in WWI.
The debate reached a nadir this
week,as David Cameron publicly
supported extending its run until
the end of the year.Luckily,we’re
here to give our own unique spin
on what the poppies mean and
represent.
Continuing on the theme of war
photography,we look at the ethics
behind the practice,and whether
it is a help of a hindrance.With
photographs returning every week
from the front lines of the war
against ebola and Instagram users
hitting near-critical mass,it seems
that there has never been more
importanttimeforphotojournalism.
We conclude with Jiaqi Shi’s review
of the new dance piece at the ROH,
which revolves around the work of
W.H.Auden and Benjamin Britten
immediately post-WWII.
War may be the engine-driver of
history,but nowhere is this more
evident than within the arts.

This is, perhaps, not the type of play
to bring your parents to – what with
the full frontal male nudity, gritty
conversation and “scenes of a sexual
nature”. However this is certainly a
production not to miss. The intricate
dance and impeccably timed dialogue
makes for an exciting and stimulating
performance in which a man’s story is
delivered in an original and inspiring
way.
JOHN is on at the National Theatre
until 13th January 2015. Tickets are
priced from £15
