Self-help tips and tricks
Chanon Wongsatayanont on coping with mental illnesses
Now that we’ve gone through
some kinds of mental
illnesses, it’s time we talk
about how to deal with them.
Friends, families and therapists can
really help but they can sometimes
feel inaccessible, especially during the
height of an episode.
You might have told your friends
and family before and they didn’t
react to it well. You might not want to
tell people because you don’t want to
burden them, or are scared that they
will treat you differently. You might
avoid therapists or professional
consultants for fear of being labelled
as someone with a mental illness.
But you can beat mental illnesses
by yourself. I’m not talking about
making it magically disappear since
it’s never going to be that easy.
Instead, you can learn to cope with it.
You can develop a habit to deal with
those phases or make them affect you
as little as possible. So here are some
self-help tips that you can try out.
Self-awareness
Also known as mindfulness. Basically
being aware of what you think and
how you feel. Being aware of when an
episode is going to rear its ugly head
and what thought cycles lead up to it.
When you can identify what exactly
triggers those phases, you can calm
yourself down and prevent it from
consuming you.
For those suffering from mental
disorders, you might identify two
voices in your head: your own and the
disorder’s.
Of course, there aren’t really
multiple voices, just the kind of
things you think normally and what
you think when you’re going through
a phase. With self-awareness, you can
untangle these two voices and know
which of them you should listen to. If
you realize this early on in an episode,
you can quickly dismiss the voice of
the disorder and stop yourself from
slipping further.
Here’s an example. A phase of
depression is often triggered by a
difficult event which sets of a cycle
of negative thoughts which put the
blame on yourself. Before you know
it, you’re depressed and when you
want to feel better, you find it nearly
impossible. So you become more
depressed about being depressed.
If the cycle of negative thoughts is
broken early, you wouldn’t have to
lapse into a phase at the first place.
Keeping active
As difficult as it feels when, doing
something active can be just the thing
to wrest you from those monsters in
your head. Playing sport, going to
If you are concerned
about your own mental
health,or that of a loved
one,there are people out
there you can talk to who
can give you advice,or will
be there to listen.

You can also go to your
academic or personal tutor
regarding pastoral issues,
especially if you think your
mental health might be
affecting your academic

the gym, taking a walk in the park or
just going out to buy some groceries
can break you away from the
familiar environment you’re always
in whenever you experience the
symptoms of the mental illness.
I understand, however, that ‘doing
stuff’ is the opposite of what you want
to do whenever you’re going through
a phase. Depression can shoot down
any attempts to go outside with
questions like “What’s the point?”
Anxiety can take you through every
single scenario that can go wrong.
But by going outside you can prove
those beliefs wrong.
Doing something, like sports,
can lift your mood and increase
energy levels. Exercising can use up
adrenaline and other hormones that
are produced when you are under
stress, making you feel more relaxed.
You will have heard all these
benefits about staying active from
your mum when you’re a kid, but do
give it a go. Doing something is likely
better than nothing.
Make a list
Having a list of things you have to
do or achieve written down in front
of you will make it feel much less
threatening. This is particularly
relevant for anxiety because panic
attacks often come when you’re
overwhelmed by everything you have
to do.
You might think that you’ll waste
even more time making the list and it
would be one more thing to add to the
things you’ll have to do.
But look at this. “I will do A, B, C
today, D can be done tomorrow, and
E, F, G can be left until the end of
the week” sounds less stressful than
having all those tasks dancing around
your overburdened head. It gives you
a sense of control, that all these tasks
are manageable and that they’re not
infinite.
For depression, a list can also keep
you grounded in day-to-day life,
urging you to trudge on and complete
what you have to do.
Doing everything in the list will
give a sense of achievement that can
break your cycle of negativity and
self-blame.
Basically, the list can ensure
productivity, making your disorder
be less disruptive to your daily life.
I hope these tips will be useful in
helping yourself get out of those horrible
episodes whenever you next experience
it. As always, some will be more useful
than others, depending on the type of
person you are.
So I would recommend that, even
though you can manage quite fine on
your own talking to friends, family or
professionals can really help you cope
with it in a way that is most meaningful
to you.
Making a list can help take things one step at a time. Photo: martinrumack
