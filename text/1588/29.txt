Interstellar is to Nolan what
Sandinista! was to the Clash; a
brilliant work interspersed amidst
layers of fatuous clutter and turgid
artistic pretensions.
It is a film that displays Nolan at
his very best and worst: a cerebral,
tense, visually stunning one-and-
a-half hour space opera buried in
another one-and-a half hours of
pompous platitudes and mindless
exposition.
It is clunky, bloated, and dissonant,
yet in places undeniably breath-
taking and atmospheric. Within
a single scene, it will range from
edge-of-the-seat exciting to dull-
as-dishwater boring. It showcases
Nolan’s talent for visual effects,
alongside a lack of cinematographic
prowess.
Interstellar is, ultimately, a
collection of contradictions; with the
overall impression simply an average
between the very good and very bad.
The story, at its core, is a simple
one. The human population is
dying, ravaged by world wars and an
agricultural blight. The remnants
of humanity are reduced to eking
out a living as farmers, working the
increasingly infertile land. Starvation
is all but guaranteed, and eliminating
the blight is no longer possible.
Humankind’s only hope for
survival rests on finding a new world
to colonise. Thus four astronauts:
Cooper (Matthew McConaughey),
Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly
(David Gyasi), and Doyle (Wes
Bentley) must travel through a newly
discovered wormhole in search of
such a habitable new world.
Resources for the mission are
limited, and the prospect of the
returning is dependent on finding a
habitable world before their fuel runs
out. Should they be unable to return,
they are to colonise a new world with
thousands of human zygotes, leaving
the population of earth behind to die.
It is an uncharacteristically
straightforward plot for Nolan, and
it is a good one. It is also distinctly
human; much of the best material
in the film comes from how the four
astronauts perceive the enormity of
their mission and the prospect that
they may never return home.
Of course, the core concept does
not justify three hours of screen-
time, and thus is padded out with
subplot upon subplot until the film
becomes completely saturated with
superfluous subject matter.
Some subplots, like Cooper’s
relationship with his daughter back
on earth, work excellently and drive
the plot along.
Many others, however, are largely
redundant and simply serve as
a soapbox for Nolan as he spews
New Age spiritual woo and inane
technobabble. Because of this,
McConaughey and Hathaway are
forced to constantly juggle multiple
contradictory facets of their
respective roles, the end result being
that neither performer can fully
bring their talent to bear for any
length of time.
Indeed, one of the most frustrating
aspects of Interstellar is that it is
an excellent examination of the
human condition, yet it is inhabited
by surprisingly insubstantial and
schematic characters.
Yet, in spite of this, it is ultimately
a good – at times great – film.
The use of relativity and other
scientific tenets as plot drivers lends
it credibility as a science fiction
picture, while the bleak, foreboding
tension that suffuses much of the
film conjures up memories of Danny
Boyle’s Sunshine (and to a lesser
extent, Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear).
Nolan’s realisation of a dying
Earth, in contrast, is a homage to
Steinbeck’s corpus of dust-bowl
literature, and the juxtaposition of
exotic alien worlds against a portrayal
of humanity as a fading, agrarian
society proves to be one of his best
flourishes.
The visuals, also, are breathtakingly
realised; few films (Alfonso Cuarón’s
Gravity is only exception that springs
to mind) manage to evoke the scale
and emptiness of space as well as
Interstellar. All in all, it is a work that
speaks volumes about the power of
Nolan’s imagination as well his talent
with aesthetics and a flair with the
eclectic.
Ultimately, Interstellar is
disappointing not because the film
itself, but rather what it could have
been. Had the story been more
focused, the characters more fleshed
out, the result would be have been
a classic piece of sci-fi cinema, of a
quality on par with Stanley Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet, Nolan
proves to be his own worst enemy, as
he sacrifices focus and simplicity for
sentimentality and pretension.
In the end, Interstellar feels like a
missed opportunity.

The week at Imperial Cinema

Drama groups are fast approaching.
Unfortunately that means that this
is the last film from us until the All-
Nighter in the final week of term.
Dawn on the Planet of the
Apes
Director: Matt Reeves
Screenplay: Mark Bomback,Rick
Jaffa,Amander Silver
Cast: Andy Serkis,Jason Clarke,Gary
Oldman,Keri Russell,Toby Kebbell
This sequel to the 2005 hit film,
RiseofthePlanetApes,is a return to
the essence of the original films:
political intrigue,complex ape
families,and humans who are a bit
silly.
Set a few years after the end
of Rise,humanity is struggling
to survive having been nearly
wiped out by Simian Flu.The apes,
however,have made the Redwoods
their own and have continued to
develop.When a group of humans
are forced to enter the apes’land to
attempt to fix a hydro-electric dam
to provide power to their colony in
the city,the stage is set for a tense
dialogue between cultures.
The relentless plot,fantastic
battle sequences and decent
characterisation (especially of the
apes),make this a good film,it’s the
motion capture performances and
visual effects that make it great.
Hailed as the best development
in visual effects since Avatar,Dawn
does with CGI what could only have
been done with men in monkey
suits before,make the apes look
truly realistic.This is mainly due
to the use of the motion capture
technology.It gives the apes true
depth of character–this could very
well be the film that finally gets
Andy Serkis the awards recognition
he deserves.
If that isn’t enough for you,Dawn
also features apes firing machine
guns while riding horses.It’s hard to
go wrong with that.
