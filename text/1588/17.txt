“Idon’t like honours.”
When asked how he felt to
have been awarded the Nobel
Prize, the most prestigious honour
that can be bestowed upon a scientist,
Richard Feynman seemed rather
unimpressed.
“I’ve already got the prize,” he
said. “The prize is the pleasure of
finding the thing out, the kick in
the discovery, seeing other people
use it. Those are the real things. The
honours are unreal to me.”
Presumably then, Feynman would
not have had much interest in the
Breakthrough Prizes.
Founded in 2012 by some of the
world’s most famous billionaires, the
2015 awards were announced this
week to recognise those scientists
behind the biggest ‘breakthroughs’
in life sciences, fundamental physics
and mathematics.
Starting with a $3 million prize
fund that spits in the face of the
Nobel’s puny $1.1 million, everything
about the Breakthrough Prizes is big.
They aim to turn scientists into “rock
stars” with a star-studded, Oscars-
style awards ceremony, and inject
some “razzmatazz” into the rather
tedious business of curing cancer and
finding a theory of everything.
One of those funding the prize,
Mark Zuckerberg, thinks they have
“the potential to provide a platform
for other models of philanthropy,
so people everywhere have an
opportunity at a better future.”
Those behind the project seem
to think of themselves as doing
something good for humanity:
encouraging breakthroughs in
medicine, recognising genius, and
generally making science seem sexy.
How they hope it will achieve these
lofty ambitions, I’m not quite sure.
Unlike the excellent Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, another
billionaire’s philanthropic gesture,
the Breakthrough Prizes do not
directly pay for any new research.
How is giving away $3 million to
blow on a house or a yacht supposed
to have a better impact on humanity
than using it to fund a lab? It’s
not even like the people receiving
this money have gone previously
unrecognised—many are also Nobel
laureates, and all command salaries
vastly greater than what the average
researcher could ever hope to achieve.
The entire project seems as empty
as the wiry ball that serves as a
trophy. Among the criticism of the
prizes was an editorial in Nature
which points out: “you cannot buy
class, as the old saying goes, and
these upstart entrepreneurs cannot
buy their prizes the prestige of the
Nobels.”
Even its name is the biggest cliché
in science reporting.
Unusually for an award, news
coverage has been directed more
towards those handing out the
prizes than their recipients. They
come across as a feeble attempt
at philanthropy by a bunch of
billionaires who don’t want to be
shown up by Bill Gates and Warren
Buffet. How many people could
name a single recipient of any one
of these prizes? So much for making
scientists famous.
It’s true that we need to do all
we can to promote science and
technology. We need to make sure
that bright new ideas for treating
diseases get the funding they need
to make it into hospitals. We need
to promote more esoteric research
into mathematics and fundamental
physics, not just so we better
understand the world we live in, but
to lay the foundations for potential
future technologies. We need to
encourage bright young people to
take science up as a career, and to
ensure that the public is aware of
the enormous benefits of scientific
advancement.
But the Breakthrough Prizes
achieve none of this. The way to
promote science is by showing it as it
is: interesting, rewarding and useful.
Science isn’t about becoming rich
and famous. Science is about doing
science. Trying to dress it up with a
pointlessly large cheque really isn’t
doing anyone any favours.
On Wednesday afternoon, the
signal came through that
one of the most ambitious
space missions ever attempted has
successfully landed on a comet.
In the ten years since it was
launched, Rosetta has travelled six
billion kilometres to reach comet
67P/C-G, currently orbiting the sun
between Mars and Jupiter.
Rosetta arrived at the comet in the
summer, and has spent the past few
weeks in orbit around it, creating
detailed images of the surface to
determine a suitable landing site.
The final landing was complicated
by the unusual shape of the comet,
and the 30 minute delay in radio
communications due to the
enormous distances involved.
Rosetta travelled with a probe called
Philae, designed to detach from the
craft and carry out the landing.
Philae is equipped with two
harpoons, intended to fire into the
surface and ensure it doesn’t skip off
because of the comet’s weak gravity.
It carries a mass spectrometer,
radiation detector, and high-
resolution cameras.
The European Space Ageny (ESA)
first proposed the mission more
than 20 years ago, to investigate the
chemical composition of a comet,
as well as its general structure and
magnetic environment. Information
on organic compounds is also hoped
to give us a new understanding of the
possible role of comets in the origin
of life on earth.
The Rosetta probe, still in orbit,will
continue to take data from above, and
analyse dust and gas released as the
comet heats up during its approach to
the sun.
Despite the successful outcome.
the mission has not been without its
problems. It was originally intended
to land on a different comet, 46/
Wirtanen, but a delay caused by a
rocket failure meant a different target
had to be found.
"The Prizes
aim to turn
scientists
into rock
stars."
