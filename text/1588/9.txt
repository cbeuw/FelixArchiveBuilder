Kensington residents have
been up in arms over a
recent planning application
submitted by Minerva Ltd to the
Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea (RBKC), which entails
demolishing a number of iconic
Kensington High Street buildings,
including the Odeon Kensington
cinema.
The specific sites which will be
involved in the development work
are 257-265 Kensington High Street,
as well as 4-10 and 24 Earl’s Court
Road, all in the W8 area. Minerva
holds the freehold interest in these
properties, with prior planning
permission granted in December
2012 for c. 100,000 square feet of
“private residential accommodation,
with a basement car park and
cinema”.
The new application, received
by the council on the 14th
October
and publicly viewable on the
RBKC council website, describes
the proposed work as involving
“demolition of the former Post
Office delivery office, Whitlock
House office building and the cinema
building with retention of the cinema
facade to Kensington High Street.”
A major development proposal, it
states that its purpose is to construct
“63 residential units (including
affordable housing units) and
associated residential facilities, retail/
class D1 and office accommodation,
car parking spaces, cycle parking [...]
public realm improvements and
associated works.” It also mentions
the “construction of a basement
and buildings to provide cinema
facilities”, presumably to replace the
resulting loss of the Odeon facilities.
It is yet to be known however what
capacity this new cinema will hold, if
it will be open to the public, or who
would be in charge of running it.
To date, over 200 objection letters
have been received by the council
since late October. Common concerns
raised in these include proximity
to noise and dust for residents near
Pembroke Place, the loss of small
independent businesses caused by
demolishing the W8 portion of
Earl’s Court Road, as well as potential
hazards arising from congestion
due to moving the proposed new
underground cinema’s entrance
from Kensington High Street to the
smaller Earl’s Court Road. Many
have also denounced the proposed
development as “another faceless,
monolithic building” that adds “no
cultural value to our High Street”.

On the morning of Monday
13th
November, an explosion
detonated by a female suicide
bomber killed 47 people and injured
79 others in Yobe, Niberia. The attack
took place at a local school, and the
suicide bomber entered the school
undetected, wearing a school uniform
and carrying explosive materials in a
backpack.
The attack follows a five-year
Islamic insurgency in the country,
and it is believed that it was
orchestrated by the Islamic extremist
group Boko Haram.
The group has been responsible
for a number of other attacks on
Nigerians, notably the kidnapping
of 276 girls from a town in North
Eastern Nigeria in April 2014.
The failure of government and
military forces to effectively fight the
insurgency has caused widespread
anger amongst the Nigerian people,
and indeed soldiers who arrived at
the school disaster were chased and
heckled by the people for failing to
deal with Boko Haram.
The attack took place during an
assembly attended by 2,000 students
at the Government Technical Science
college. Musa Ibrahim Yahaya,
one of the students who survived
the blast, said that he “… heard a
deafening sound and I was blown off
me feet. People started screaming
and running, I saw blood all over my
body.”
Musa is being treated for
some minor head wounds but
unfortunately some of his peers have
more serious injuries, some of which
may require amputations.
Boko Haram, the primary suspects
for the brutal attack, are notorious
violent non-state actors, with
ideologies much like ISIL.
The groups advocates a particularly
strict form of Sharia law, and its
ultimate aim is to establish an
Islamic state in Nigeria. It completely
opposes Western influence on
Nigerian society, and wishes to focus
its efforts on the mainly Christian Photo: IRIN/Aminu Abubakar (file)

Southern region of the country.
The Boko Haram are a Jihadist group
that actively seek and kill people who
engage in activities that they consider
to be ‘non-Islamic,’ such as dinking
alcohol, attending school if you’re a
girl and not wearing the full niqab.
Interestingly, for 7 years since
the group was founded, it was not
so violent and mainly practiced
its beliefs in remote villages of the
North-Eastern Region of the country.
In 2009, Nigerian police arrested
nine Boko Haram members who
were suspected to be planning
terrorist attacks, with their weapons
and bomb-making equipment also
confiscated.
Since 2011, the group’s steady
rate of attacks has claimed many
lives, and the attacks are only
increasing in scale. As the group
continues to pillage the country,
there is increasing pressure on the
Nigerian government to deal with the
insurgents in order to restore peace to
the country.
mention that the proposed plans
appear to have had the height of the
main housing block increased,, which
is unfavourable to residents near the
Odeon from a privacy standpoint
“due to increased noise and light
pollution”. Comments on the
planning application will close today
(14th
Nov), with the council aiming to
reach a decision by 16th
Jan, 2015.
This is not the first time that
the Odeon Kensington has been
threatened with closure. With
its existence dating back to the
1920s, it was initially known as The
Kensington, before being renamed
the Majestic in 1940.It was known for
its then-revolutionary architecture,
as its design was a deliberate attempt
to move away from the fairground
origins of cinema in the day. The
Rank Organization, a now-defunct
entertainment conglomerate, were
responsible for its current name after
a takeover in the late 1940s.
The original Art Deco interior
of the building, is believed to be
no longer intact, which prevents
English Heritage from listing the
Odeon Kensington for preservation
(it currently has a Certificate of
Immunity which prevents it from
being listed until 2018). However, the
Cinema Theatre Association suggests
that some of its original features may
be hidden by false walls and ceilings.
A firm favourite of the late Michael
Winner, the Odeon Kensington
appears in the press every now
and again as his “designated local
cinema”. He was also rumored to
have made an arrangement with its
management where he donates to
charity every year in return for free
pick n’ mix on every visit.
