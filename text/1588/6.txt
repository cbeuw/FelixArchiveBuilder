Earlier this week, in light of the
recent incidents concerning
anti-social behaviour,
Imperial College Union released the
penalties that will be held against
both Imperial College Union Rugby
Football Club (ICURFC) and Imperial
Medicals Rugby Football Club.
The ICURFC has been suspended
for two weeks from the 11th
November, with the 22 members
on the team that played on the 29th
October suspended from all Union
rugby teams until the end of the
calendar year.
Meanwhile, the Medics team is also
suspended for two weeks from the
11th, with a suspension of all social
activities of the club until the 19th
December 2014.
These penalties affect around 120
students in total from across the two
clubs and the three teams each that
they contain. The Medicals will be
unable to host the Christmas Bop at
Reynolds as a result of these penalties.
Additionally, both the Medics 3rd
team who played on the 29th October
and the ICURFC’s players will be
made to perform “Union service”.
The nature of “Union service” is
yet to be determined by the Union,
however the ICURFC members
are said to be keen to spend their
time taking part in some grassroots
rugby training for children, through
Community Connections.
The sanctions were announced to
members of Union Council, who met
on Tuesday evening in their third
meeting of the year.
Union President Tom Wheeler
added that the entire ICURFC is
being punished, due to the fact that
the club has decided that it is to take
responsibility for the incidents as a
whole, not just the individuals who
were responsible.
ICURFC members were reported
to have stripped on several Tube
platforms on the 29th October,
causing a District Line train to
temporarily suspend its service. The
Medicals were also recently involved
in the smashing of a window of a
coach whilst on their School’s Tour.
The Medicals also are under further
scrutiny after alleged drunken
misbehaviour at the new Heston
sports ground.
In a comment to Felix, Tom
continued, “We, as a Union, are
willing to vigorously defend student-
led, independent activity in the
Union. It is never our intention to
stop students from having fun whilst
participating in activity, however
these incidents clearly crossed a line.
“I believe that the decision made
by the Governance Committee is
the first step of the process towards
achieving a truly progressive,
inclusive and positive reputation.
“The Sabbatical Team and I are
willing to dedicate as much time as
it takes to assist Clubs, Societies and
Projects in reaching this common
goal.”
The penalties against ICUFRC
are considered stricter than those
imposed on the Medicals, due to the
team’s compliance with the Union’s
investigations. Said Tom, “We can
only commend George Cross [the
Imperial Medicals’ Club Captain]
for how he has responded during the
investigation.”
Council was also informed that a
Motion of No Confidence would be
brought forward to the next meeting
of Council against the Club Captain of
ICURFC, Thomas Hobson.
As it stands currently, members of
Council will be voting for or against
this motion of No Confidence at the
next meeting, on the 9th December.
Tom Hobson spoke to Felix about
the sanctions and how this will affect
his team.
Said Hobson, “I would first like
to say that I believe these sanctions
have been very harsh on our club
and all our members will feel these
punishments. It has put all three
teams in a very difficult position,
however this is not the end of
anybody’s season.
“The 2nds and 3rds will only miss
two games, and even though the 1st
team will not be playing or training
until after Christmas, we will still
have the majority of our season left.
This is plenty of time to regain a
decent league position.
“As regards to the vote of no
confidence, I believe this is mainly
due to the fact we faced this issue and
any consequences as a team and club.
“As Club Captain it is natural to
bring my position into question,
especially due to the media traction
this event gained.”
In a statement published on the
Union website, a spokesperson
said: “Whilst we regret that some
individuals who may not have been
involved in these incidents will suffer
as a result of the punishments, the
culture and behaviour of the clubs as
a whole needs to change.”
The Governance sub-committee
of the Board of Trustees of Imperial
College Union met earlier this week
to determine these penalties. The
sub-committee, made up by four
Penalties for Rugby announced
Teams have been suspended and made to miss key matches
"A Motion
of No
Confidence
would be
brought
forward to
the next
meeting of
Council"

members of the Board of Trustees,
included Abi de Bruin, Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies);
Andy Heeps, Lay Trustee; Paul
Beaumont, Council Chair; and Hiba
Saleem Danish, a fourth year medical
student who is also an elected Student
Trustee.
Tom Wheeler and three members
of Union staff were also present to
observe the meeting.
The decision made by the
Governance sub-committee does not
affect other teams within the two
clubs, who can, and will, continue
to play matches in the British
University and Colleges Sport (BUCS)
League.
In an email to the club, Thomas
Hobson advised all people in the
ICURFC first team who were not part
of the team sheet for the match on the
30th October to play in the second
team, who can still play for BUCS
points too.
As a result of these suspensions, the
Medicals will miss three matches, but
should be able to make their next one
on the 10th December.
ICURFC will miss a total of four
games, one being a cup fixture. Two
teams will be relegated, and the total
BUCS points for the ICURFC will be
0, whilst the Medicals will sink down
to -9 points.
"The
culture and
behaviour
of the
clubs as
a whole
needs to
change."
