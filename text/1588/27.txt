A Tempting Trio of Modern Dance
In front of a warm, receptive
crowd, last Friday saw the opening
of an exciting programme at
the Royal Opera House, including
a new ballet by Liam Scarlett,
choreographed to Bernstein’s
Symphony no. 2, The Age of Anxiety.
This beautiful adaptation is based
on the synonymous poem by W.H.
Auden, awarded a Pulitzer for
the tale in 1948. The nuances and
complexities of the poem boil down
to a simple story set in New York:
four lonely strangers during the
tumultuous times of World War II
who strike up a friendship in a bar,
developing into intimacy as the night
wears on.
The stage design was artistically
arranged with a neon lit bar and
American-style drinking booths. The
four were alone in their thoughts, but
a collective conscience resonated in
each of them, of under-achievement,
of helplessness and confusion as the
radio broadcasts reports of the war far
away. They soon become acquainted,
with the characters deep in
conversation discussing the anxiety
of man and the human condition.
Rosetta, the only woman in the group,
invites the other three to continue the
jollity back in her apartment, which
forms the second scene of the ballet.
The characters dance and pirouette
their way skilfully around the stage,
at times in frenzy and others in
quiet contemplation. This ballet was
undoubtedly the highlight of the
night, with a few pleasant surprises
along the way!
Another eminent and celebrated
contemporary of Auden’s was
composer Benjamin Britten, whose
works form the music for Ceremony of
Innocence and Aeternum. The former
is an early Britten work, when he was
undergoing some major events in his
life: slowly maturing into an artist,
creativity stalling, having just lost
his mother in the same year. He was
losing his childhood innocence; for
one is always a child in our mother’s
eyes, but she was now gone and he
was struggling, innocence having
played a great role in shaping his
present life. The music grapples
with this profound sense of a loss
of innocence. Choreographer Kim
Brandstrup resolves the problem in
this nouveau coming-of-age story,
saying that we must accept that we
“are going to disappear, accepting the
disappearance and the gaps as you go
on”. Aside from all this seriousness,
there were some very creative
use of shadows and a beautiful
backdrop that changed dynamically,
enthralling the audience with a
images of the sea, a key theme in this
ballet.

On 11th
June 1963, a Vietnamese
Buddhist monk, Thích
Quang Đúc, sat down at
a busy intersection in Saigon,
was covered in gasoline, and set
himself alive. Protesting against the
persecution of Buddhists by the South
Vietnamese government, he burned
for 10 minutes before collapsing
backwards. The act was captured by
Malcolm Wilde Browne, a 32 year old
photographer, who was working for
the Associated Press, and the rest, as
they say, is history.
To this day, the photograph of ‘The
Burning Monk’ is one of the most
famous images of all time, and joins
the litany of photographs of war that
have shocked, stunned, and changed
the world. But what of those behind
the camera? What is their role in the
conflict?
Susan Sontag, writing in her
seminal volume On Photography,
says “Photographs state the
innocence, the vulnerability of
lives heading toward their own
destruction; this link haunts all
photographs of people”. So when the
war photographer takes an image are
they doing anything different from
other photographers? By showing
us an image of a Viet Cong prisoner
being executed, Eddie Adams is
simply reminding us of the fragility
of humanity, similar to what Walker
Evans does with his documentation
of American poverty. And yet,
there is something fundamentally
different about war photographs
– becoming an observer, an act
implicit in the field of photography,
is one thing, but in these situations
does the photographer act as a
collaborator with the injustice they
are documenting.
Judith Butler, legendary gender
theorist, thinks that this is the case
with modern war photography,
particularly in the case of torture
victims. Regarding the use of war
images in the US, she writes:
“Currently, the state operates
on the fields of perception and
representability, in order to control
effect, and in anticipation of the way
that effect informs and galvanizes
political opposition to the war.”
But this doesn’t take into account
the role that photographs can play
in disseminating information,
such as Don McCullin’s work in the
Vietnam War, which galvanised
popular opinion against the
government. Sure, images can be
used by a government as a means of
propaganda – see Leni Riefenstahl’s
work which, despite its magnificence,
is tainted by her associations with the
Nazi Party – but they can also be used
by individuals to bring inform and
educate.
But what about the idea of
intervention? In Kevin Carter’s
Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph
of a child starving in Sudan, a hooded
vulture leers down over the child’s
body, as if waiting for their eventual
death. “Surely”, some may say,
“Carter could have chased the bird
away; he could have given the child
food; he could have done something”.
Ultimately, Carter did the only thing
he knew to do; he took a photograph.
To say that Carter was unfeeling,
however, would be churlish – he
committed suicide 3 months after
winning the Pulitzer, leaving a note:
“I am haunted by the vivid
memories of killings and corpses and
anger and pain”.
Another issue is that of agency; to
what extent do the subjects of a war
photograph enter into the dialogue
about what war is? It could be argued
that when a photographer takes an
image of their subject, they place
them in the position of a victim, with
or without their consent. The person
in the photograph is destroyed,
and all that remains is a symbol, a
representation of warfare; it is, as
Sontag said, like the photograph is “a
sublimated murder – a soft murder”,
and by performing these actions the
photographer further oppresses those
caught up in the living hell of warfare.
Maybe this argument makes too
many presumptions; perhaps those
featured in the photographs are more
than willing to have their suffering
recorded and documented. More
likely all they want is to return to
normality. Could it be that war
photographers humanise their
subjects? Simone Weil, the celebrated
French philosopher, puts the matter
as follows: “... to love one’s neighbour
is a question of being able to ask
simply: what is your torment?”. The
war photographer poses this question
to the subject, and then allows their
voice to project around the world
through an image.
“Such photographs”, says John
Berger, “remind us shockingly of the
lived reality behind the abstractions
of political theory, casualty statistics
or news bulletins”. They reveal
to us the world as it really is, and
ultimately this is the job of the war
photographer.
They are not part of the political
system; they are not there to fight,
or campaign, or argue; they are
simply there to record the truth, no
matter how horrific it may be. Their
photographs, as Berger says, “are
printed on the black curtain which is
drawn across what we choose to refuse
to know.”
The Ethics of War Photography

If you prefer the more ethereal
(and without giving too much away),
the final performance to the Sinfonia
da Requiem ticks the box in every
category: technicality, imagination
and atmosphere. It is not surprising
that it was awarded an Olivier for Best
New Dance Production last year.
Whether you are an experienced
opera-goer or a complete beginner to
ballet, there is something on offer for
you at this spectacular trio.
Ceremony of Innocence/The Age of
Anxiety/Aeternum is on at the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, until the
17th November.
Tickets are priced from £4-65, and can
be purchased online from www.roh.org.uk
