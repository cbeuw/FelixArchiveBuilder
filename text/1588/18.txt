Talion was arrested soon after for indecent exposure... oh, and for murdering a innocent orc...

Maximilian Eggl reviews the latest addition to this titanic franchise
"I actually
felt like
I was in
my own
personal
Lord of
the Rings
movie."
"This
one time
reality
managed
to not
only hold
up to my
hopes but
soundly
beat them."
Yes, ok, the Lord of the Rings:
Shadow of Mordor was
released a while ago, but
after completing it just last week
and being so thoroughly impressed,
I felt that I really needed to share
this with you guys. For all of you
who missed it, the Shadow of Mordor
is a new Stealth-RPG style Lord of
the Rings game, that takes between
the happenings of the Hobbit and
the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Its
completely new material that aims
to add a new franchise and lore to
this already extensive world. You
play as the ranger Talion, who, with
his family, has been murdered by the
Hand of Sauron, as Sauron returns
to Mordor. Strangely enough you do
not die, as your soul bonds with that
of an ancient wraith. With your new
added powers of the wraith you aim
to uncover its past as well as avenge
your loved ones.
The story of the game was
absolutely outstanding. From
start to finish I never felt that I
wasn’t playing a cheap knock-off
of a Tolkien story, but an actual
proper story living and breathing
in Middle Earth. Without revealing
too much (even though I really want
to gush about the epicness that is
some scenes), I can tell you that
we see the return of very familiar
characters like Gollum, as well as
being introduced to new ones that
further the lore. All of the cutscenes
were really well done, and the acting
was all incredibly good. So good in
fact that I actually felt like I was in
my own personal Lord of the Rings
movie. Very rarely have I gotten
chills when playing a game, but I
definitely got them in this game.
While these shivers could been
amplified because I love Lord of the
Rings so much, there still is certainly
something magical about this
worthy admission to Middle Earth.
The game itself takes place in
Mordor. Now the Mordor you
probably have in mind, is the one
portrayed in the movies, black,
burned and full of lava. The Mordor
of the Shadow of Mordor, could
not be any different. Sauron has
just returned back home, and his
armies have not had a time to
ravage this green landscape. Also,
there is a super green area around
the sea of Núrn! How else do you
think that the Orcs would get their
grub? Magic?! So, basically you are
surrounded by green grass, ancient
ruins of Human buildings, and great
trees dotting the area you traverse.
Furthermore, the creatures and Orcs
that roam this land, do so at random,
and gives the world a vibrancy and
life I have found hard-pressed to
find in most games.
The missions in the story, fit in
extremely well, and the fact that I
could do them at any time I wanted
to removed the forced element
that you sometimes have. All the
missions I did themselves never
really followed those clichéd RPG
missions, where you collect stuff and
grind away for better gear. In fact, I
never felt that I needed to grind at
any point, I rarely cared about my
runes I had equipped because it was
so fun to play.
The mechanics of the game, while
quite similar to the Assassin’s Creed
series, was still really well executed.
The stealth element works really
well, and I felt so amazing when I
stealth dropped and cut a throat. The
combat is also really fun, and holy
shit those executions are really epic.
While obviously there is a finite
amount of animations, it never felt
repetitive and I would whoop with
joy when a particularly bloody came
up. The only thing that I can say
that slightly disappointed me was
the whole mind control thing. I am
definitely not saying its bad, and to
be honest I didn’t really know what
to expect, I still felt like there was
something missing.
The thing that I really liked
was the whole nemesis system! I
brutally scarred one Orc leader
while trying to kill him, but didn’t
actually decapitate him, meaning he
survived! I can tell you, he definitely
didn’t take being mutilated well.
His face was a horrible mass, and
according to information I procured,
he was actually unable to chew
properly! Basically, the fact that
I was able to uniquely influence
the future of those I met, was an
experience that I had never had
before and to perfectly frank it
was incredible. Furthermore the
vendetta missions, which basically
were just missions to kill Orc leaders,
but with the twist that you were
avenging the deaths of players who
had been killed by these guys in their
OWN game. This added a whole new
dimension of interacting with other
people’s worlds, and every time on of
these came up, I dropped what I was
doing to complete it.
In terms of the pedantic details,
the graphics and sound track live
up to the amazing standard set by
all the other parts of this game. The
graphics, are exceptional and if you
have a graphic card that can handle
the load, be ready to be awed by the
visual detail that will burn your eyes.
The water, lighting effects make for
such an immersive experience and
definitely the sharpest rendition of
Middle Earth I have ever seen!
Now the one thing I was slightly
worried about was replay value.
Would I be able to pick this title up
once I finished it? After messing
about for 30 hours on this game, I
can tell you definitely! Killing Orcs,
doing sick combos and slowly taking
control of Mordor was just so fun.
I could have probably finished the
game early if I hadn’t been messing
about so much. Trust me, I will
definitely be dipping back into the
Shadow of Mordor pool again.
What I hope you have managed
to convey in this review is how
much this has managed to live up
to my hyped expectations. I have
this amazing ability of hyping
upcoming games to the point that
reality cannot possibly stand up to
my imagination. This has ruined
several game for me. As much as
I tried to not get hyped for this
game, I still did. I was super excited
when I finally got my hands on it.
In the back of my mind, I was truly
afraid that I would once again be
disappointed. However, this one time
reality managed to not only hold
up to my expectations but soundly
beat them. The game made me fall in
love with Lord of the Rings all over
again. I would seriously recommend
anyone getting it, as it is totally
worth it.
Once I had finished the main story,
all I could think was: “this was so
incredibly good, where is the sequel,
take my money.” Its not often that
you get that feeling, and one I hope
that you will also experience when
completing this game.
DUDE?! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I AM BUSY??? GAWD!!. Photo: Gamespot
