In the 2015 election, one of the
largest issues will be the size of
the Government. People are
asking questions, such as “what
should the Government provide?”,
and “how much control should
the Government have in our
lives?”. These questions split the
political parties, with Conservatives
generally in favour of having a
smaller Government, and Labour
in favour of a larger one. Parties
have a spectrum of answers to this
question.
As economists, however, should
we even attempt to answer these
questions? Economists often debate
whether economics is normative
or positive. Positive economists
argue that values are irrelevant in
discussion of economics, whereas
normative economists argue for value
judgements on important economic
issues. Often someone will assert
“growth is good” or “unemployment
is bad” without questioning it. In
reality, economic issues have pros
and cons, and affect some positively
and others negatively. In political
economics especially, no answer is
straightforward.
For positive economists, there is no
distinction between values and truth.
The correct size of the government
is a question with a correct answer,
just like there are correct answers to
scientific questions. These answers
can be found using the tools of
political economics; economics
becomes almost scientific. A positive
statement might be: “Sweden has
a higher level of taxation than the
USA”.
By contrast normative economists
focus on ideas like justice and
fairness and ask what government
policy ought to be. For example, a
normative economist may say: “the
Government needs to raise benefits
because the poorest people need
higher living standards”.
Politicians often evaluate economic
policy in terms of macroeconomic
objectives. These objectives might
not be in the speeches of some party
leaders, but they are important.
These objectives are: growth,
unemployment, inflation and the
balance of trade. One way to measure
government efficacy is whether
the government has used economic
policy efficiently to fulfil these
objectives.
Economists often talk of real GDP
per capita. This is simply the total
amount of UK goods and services per
person, after factoring in inflation.
Growth is simply the percentage
increase in this quantity per year,
and is a key indicator of a country’s
economic performance. Currently,
UK growth is 0.8% for the past three
months, or an average of 3.2% this
year. The government does not set a
specific target for growth, but 2.5% is
considered to be a sustainable level.
After the recession (half a year of
negative growth) during the tenure
of the previous government, this
could be considered a success for the
coalition. However, all economic

The diversity of opinion that shapes elections
Samuel Bodansky discusses the issues in the 2015 elections
arguments have counterpoints and
caveats: many people question the
way the economy has grown. Has
this growth come with high prices
and unbearable living costs? Is the
growth environmentally sustainable?
Some say that this growth has
merely benefitted the richest in the
economy, as the rich get richer and
the poor get poorer. Does growth
justify inequality? These questions
are debatable, and this debate forms
the diversity of opinions that will
shape the next election.
