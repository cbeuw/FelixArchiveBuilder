FIFA, Rohit Sharma and Andy Murray - the World
Sport Column
FIFA has released the results
of its inquiry into corruption
and the World Cup bidding
saga. In a shocking turn of events,
the document claims that Qatar
was totally innocent in the bid, and
criticises the FA for its part in the
matter. The lawyer who wrote the
document and sent it to FIFA has
said that the final version contains
“numerous materially incomplete
and erroneous representations of the
facts.”
There has been plenty else going
on in Football off the pitch as well as
on it. Convicted rapist Ched Evans
has been invited to train with his
former club Sheffield United. Evans
was released from prison a fortnight
ago. The topic has been hotly debated
amongst many activist groups, a lot
of whom don’t believe that Evans
should be allowed to play professional
football again.
Former Manchester United
manager David Moyes has been
appointed manager of Basque side
Real Sociedad. Moyes was manager at
Everton for nearly ten years before
leaving to replace Sir Alex Ferguson
at United. He was later sacked before
the end of his first season in charge.
The Spanish side are currently
languishing near the relegation
zone, having only last year been one
of David Moyes’ opponents in the
Champions League.
Morocco has chosen to withdraw
as hosts of the 2015 Africa Cup of
Nations, due to fears of the ebola
virus spreading to the country. They
have subsequently been expelled
from the tournament.
On the pitch, Warrington produced
the shock of the first round in the
FA Cup. The eighth tier side beat
Exeter by a goal to nil. In the Premier
League it was a great weekend for
Chelsea, who saw off Liverpool, whilst
Manchester City and Arsenal both
slipped up.
Lewis Hamilton saw his lead cut by
Nico Rosberg in Brazil on Sunday.
Hamilton now needs to finish second
in the season finale in Abu Dhabi to
take the World Title.
In cricket, Australian legend and
commentator Richie Benaud has
begun treatment for skin cancer.
In more light-hearted news, the
Australian cricket board has
cancelled pyrotechnics at grounds,
after a flamethrower went off in front
of opener Aaron Finch’s face.
Rohit Sharma broke the record
for the highest score in One-Day
International by a long way when
he scored 264 against Sri Lanka on
Thursday.
England lost a narrow game to
New Zealand in Rugby Union at
Twickenham. Wales were (again)
defeated by Australia, while Scotland
beat Argentina and Ireland beat
South Africa.
It was an identical story in Rugby
League, where England lost a narrow
game to New Zealand. This, coupled
with an Australian victory over
Samoa, sent England crashing out of
the Four Nations. To add insult to
injury, England hooker Josh Hodgson
faces disciplinary action after a video
emerged of him smashing a door at
a party.
At the time of writing Andy
Murray faces a crunch match against
an in-form Roger Federer in his
final group match. Novak Djokovic
has looked imperious, whilst Milos
Raonic has pulled out, with David
Ferrer replacing him.
Why you should join the Boxing Club
Alot of people around campus
look for a society that can
teach them everything needed
to not only be employable but also be
a raging success in all aspects of life.
There is only one society that will
provide you with everything you need
ranging from teamwork, discipline,
rigor to a level of fitness that makes
you unbeatable- Boxing.
Imperial College Boxing Society has
been a massive success over the years
due to the determination and rigor
needed to do well in the same. The
regular training sessions teach you to
be the fittest version of yourself and
the sessions in All Star Boxing Gym
will provide you with the technical
ability and mental strength to be a
dangerous fighter. Furthermore, the
boost to self confidence provided by
KARTIKEYA RANA such a sport is unparalleled.
There are very few clubs and
societies in England that provide an
opportunity like that provided by
Imperial Boxing. The society has been
growing through the years and last
term we became a success in com-
petitive boxing. From conducting
sparring matches with universities
such as King’s College London and
UCL, we have also been competing in
University level boxing matches with
growing success in the same!
But do not fear! Imperial Boxing is
not a place where you will be forced
into beating everyone up. We com-
pletely understand if you feel that
you are not ready or even willing to
compete. If your main focus is to have
a much greater level of fitness than
you had before then this is the society
you must join!
So if you want to be the best version
of yourself and grow during your
time at university then why not give
boxing a try?
Immortals
win 12-6
Saturday 8th November brought
the Imperial Immortals American
Football Club’s first game of
the season against Brighton
Tsunami.It was a home game
at the‘Runway’Harlington and
from the start the Immortals
came out strong and dominated
on defence shutting down
Brighton on their first drive.
This brought on the Immortals’
offence who ran the ball
hard throughout the game
consistently with the help of the
new formed offensive line,made
up mostly of rookies or returners
that hadn’t played line before.
The ball was run with success
as both Emanuel Olagbaju and
Mohammed Hussian Noor scored
rushing touchdowns in the first
half.This took the Immortals to a
12-0 lead at half time.After half-
time the offence drove the ball
down the pitch but struggled to
get the ball in the end zone,but
the second half was where the
Immortals defence really stepped
up and made some huge plays.
There were three interceptions
in the game; all in the second
half–Alex Hitchinson made two
and Bob Wurstelholme made the
other.
Another important defensive
play was Harry Collini’s forced
fumble,which was recovered by
Bob and allowed the Immortals
to maintain good offensive
pressure.Alex Hitchinson’s pick
toward the end of the game
allowed the offence to run the
ball out for the game.
Brighton scored only once in
the game but missed the extra
point to make the final score
12-6 to Imperial.This game was
not only a test for the returners
but allowed rookies to make a
statement,and many stepped up
to the line and made some big
plays–showing how well they
have fit into the club so early on.
The game’s MVPs (Most Valuable
Players) were: Will Fulton
(Defensive Line),Alex Hitchinson
(Safety),Emanuel Olagbaju
(Running Back) and Sam Hill
(Offensive Line).This was the
first game in the Premiership
South Division for the Imperial
Immortals.the Immortals are all
focused on carrying on this form
and hope to make it 2-0 against
an impressive Hertfordshire
Hurricanes team next week.
