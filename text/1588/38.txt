THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 38
14.11.2014
FELIX
ms cross the Channel
After an hour and a half of bothering
anyone unfortunate enough to pass
us by, we scored a lift with a friendly
vicar and beat the other two Warwick
teams to a ride. Victory was sweet
indeed.
The drive with the vicar was long
and he was quieter than the History
teacher who had given us a lift before,
but was kind enough to give us £20
as he dropped us off at the P&O port
in Dover. In a theme that recurred
throughout the trip, our elation was
quickly soiled after being greeted
yet again by a horde of Warwick
University students, a body of which
was growing as every minute passed.
After receiving no luck by the ferry
port, we began to prowl further up
the road from the port in hope of
unchartered territory and relief from
the piercing wind pushing in from
the sea.
After an unsuccessful three and a
half hours, we decided to fraternise
with the enemy. We sat down with a
group of unnamed students, shared
cake and energy drinks, then danced
to tinny music from a compact
speaker to ward off the pessimism
that was falling over Dover like a dark
shroud. After a further two hours
with them, desperately hoping that
a driver would take pity on us and
give us a lift, we threw our hands in
the air and labelled Dover as a waste
of time. So, after exchanging a few
more dance-offs with a girl wearing
a fake moustache and sombrero, we
said our farewell to our poorweather
friends and used the £20 given to
us by the vicar to escape Dover and
head to Folkstone to attempt the
Channel Tunnel. We sincerely hope
that the Warwick students left Dover
eventually.
After arriving at a roundabout a few
hundred metres from the Channel
Tunnel grounds, we waited no longer
than 45 minutes until a French guy
pulled over offering to give us a lift.
We could not believe our luck after
our five and a half hour wait in Dover.

Jailbreak FAQs
How do you get anywhere
without spending any
money?
Many people have taken different
approaches to get as far as they
can,most following the route
of hitchhiking.You can also try
fundraising to raise money to take
planes,trains and buy Visas.
How do you get back?
You will have to cover the cost of
getting yourself back [youhaveto

however,can give you plenty of
support in getting back and figure
out the best and cheapest route
for your return.

get back?

cheapest possible route back,but
of course if you are feeling brave,
you can try getting back the same
way you get there,for free.
How do you classify the
furthest distance?
As the crow flies.
of the slip road, we cried with joy and
ran towards the car, already thanking
him jubilantly as we climbed into his
car from the dark, chilly roadside.
‘The French Guy”, whose name
we forgot to ask, was an interesting
character. Our only record of him
is a blurry snap of his number plate
that we took as we piled into his car
and the knowledge that he had a
long, unspellable name. Our French
knight-in-shining-armour turned
out to be a student from Harper
Lee Agricultural College who was
returning home to Lyon for a week to
visit his family. We were overjoyed by
the news that he wasn’t going to stop
in Calais and was planning to bypass
Paris. It was fate.
However, as he started the long
drive from Calais to Lyon, our faith in
him deteriorated. Although lovely, he
drove 30km/h above the speed limit
and veered worryingly near cars as
he overtook them. We wondered at
the living stereotype for dangerous
French drivers sitting nonchalantly
in front of us. Although, despite his
concerning driving, he made for
amusing company.
During a description of a wild
night-out where he went home with
two girls in a state of pure oblivion, he
described how he “fucked everything
in the room apart from then”, which
after a second of sleep-deprived
confusion we realized that what he
meant to say that he made a mess by
being sick everywhere. We laughed
with chagrin at his unfortunate antics
as the speedometer hit 150km/h.
At around 04:00 the speed of the
once hurtling car declined, and so
did our driver. In a bid to keep his
eyes open to watch the deserted
road, he began to rock back and
forth. Just as we were about to raise
our concern, a stomach-dropping
THWACK assaulted the car. At our
great speed, the car had hit a hare.
To our bemusement, he was rather
distraught by the loss of life and less
so by the detachment of his front
bumper. After assessing the hare
debris spread evenly underneath
his car, we set on once again down
the abandoned motorway, where he
started to flag even further until we
suggested he stop.
We pulled into a dark stop-site on
the motorway furnished only by a few
benches and a toilet block. Outside
it was cold and rainy. After telling
us to wake him in 20 minutes, we
watched our driver pick up a pillow
and duvet from the boot and lay
himself down on a wet picnic bench
and fall rapidly into a heavy sleep.
We sat dumbfounded and in hushed
voices began to seriously question the
sanity of our driver. However, after
20 minutes had elapsed, we awoke our
only option and started on the last
leg of our journey to Dijon through a
rapidly forming dense fog.
By some miracle, we arrived in
Dijon in one piece. Shortly after
arriving we discovered that we had
won the competition. This knowledge
of success helped us break through
our tiredness and organise our return
to England via Paris.
We managed to secure a cheap train
down with minimal difficulty and
spent the day flouncing around the
Eiffel Tower and enjoying our success.
We all vowed that we would do
Jailbreak again, but bigger and better
than even this year. Jailbreak 2014 is
not an experience that any of us will
forget.
