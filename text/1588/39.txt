Imperial College Synchronised
Swimming team visited Brighton
last Sunday and had the
opportunity to swim with the
famous Brighton Dolphins!
After waking up with difficulty
and taking an early morning train,
our swimmers arrived at the pool
where the Brighton team was
waiting for them.The Brighton
Dolphins is a very successful team
involved every year in Brighton’s
fringe festival,most of their
swimmers compete in Masters
competitions,some in the 50-
60 age group! And the best is:
they usually win! National team
champions for many years now
and with three world champions
among them,they look amazing
in the water! Their routines are very
unusual,creative and inspirational,
and swimming with them is a great
opportunity for the Imperial team.
Two hours later,feeling a bit more
awake having practiced basic
moves but also fun lifts with the
Dolphins,they went for a nice
brunch,followed by a Brazilian gig,
and finally indulged in some churros
while enjoying the sun on the pier
and the beach.A few moves of land-
drilling on the beach later the team
went on to explore the famous lanes
for some window shopping and to
find a nice pub for drinks before
heading home.
If you are interested in discovering
Synchro and learning your first

The 174th Wingfield Sculls
took place last Wednesday. It
is a rowing race held annually
on the River Thames in London,
England, over a much longer
distance than summer regattas (such
as BUCS and Henley).
The course is 4.25 miles (6.8km)
and competitors race from Putney
to Mortlake. Wingfield Sculls is
an invitation event with only four
scullers racing side-by-side for the
title.
This year Imperial was lucky
enough to have three of the eight
competitors; Tim Richards and Wilf
Kimberly in the Men’s event and
Mel Wilson in the Women’s event.
Imperial dominated the results
with Mel Wilson and Tim Richards
winning for us on our home water.
The women’s race began an hour
before the Men took to the water.
Imperial’s Mel Wilson started
strongly in a contest that also
included GB rowers Vicky Thornley
(Leander) and Imogen Walsh
(London) as well as UL’s Emily Craig.
All four scullers reached the Mile
Post within the course record time of
4:44, set by Anna Watkins in 2011, so
it was some very tough competition!
Mel took a lead and just kept building
on it, she led through every time
marker, also setting a new record
to Hammersmith Bridge, bettering
Watkins’s time of 8.03 by just over
two seconds. Mel’s winning margin
gave her an emphatic victory by
more than 16s. It was an outstanding
winning performance that should
give her confidence going forward
this season for both Imperial and GB.
Defending Wingfields champion,
Walsh, finished two seconds ahead of
Craig with Thornley retiring after the
Chiswick Steps.
After the excitement of the
Women’s race, the Men’s race didn’t
disappoint. There was some early
battling between the Imperial and
UL lightweights with Tim quickly
taking the lead, he pushed on and
significantly increased his lead
between the first mile marker and
as he went through Hammersmith
Bridge he had gained clear water
between him and the others.
Meanwhile there was a tussle between
his competitors, two of whom had
been his teammates at the U23 World
Championships last year. But as it was
in the Women’s race, Tim dominated
from start to finish with a resulting
winning margin of 14 seconds.
Both Tim and Mel have joined a
group of prestigious past winners.
After receiving their beautiful silver
sculls presentation boxes at the prize
giving ceremony, hosted by Tideway
Scullers, both Wingfield winners
are now preparing for GB Trials,
alongside a very large contingent
of Imperial College Boat Club
representatives; student past and
present.
SORCHA COTTER
IC BOAT CLUB
IC Rowers set the
standard
In recent weeks two of Imperial
College London’s biggest sports
teams have been embroiled in
various activities that have brought
Imperial College Union into
disrepute. The sanctions against the
teams are causing innocent students
to miss out on playing sport. Is this
treating everyone fairly or have the
disciplinarians allowed themselves to
get influenced by the media?
Regarding the sanctions affecting
ICURFC; it was the 1st
team that
committed the offence not the entire
club, yet the whole club is facing
punishment from the actions of a few.
The Union statement: “We regret that
some individuals who may not have
been involved in these incidents will
suffer as a result of the punishments”
they then go on to talk about how
“culture and behaviour of the clubs as
a whole needs to change.”
Having been a member of a sports
team here at Imperial for the last
five years, I think it is important that
the Union recognises the difference
between a club culture and a team
culture. Whilst all the teams are part
of the same club the bond between
team mates is completely different
and maybe it is the team culture that
needs to be dealt with.
I was Club Captain of Netball last
year and I think the motion of no
confidence against Tom Hobson
is hugely unfair; it has made the
issue personal. Club officers are all
volunteers; while nominally you are
in charge in reality you are trying
to manage the actions of your peers.
This is not an easy task. Whether
Tom’s actions were ‘correct’ or
not in the eyes of the Governance
Committee he was looking out for his
club and his members’ best interests.
Whilst stripping down and drinking
on the tube is illegal and disruptive
the safety of those involved and the
public was not compromised, whilst
a smashed window on a coach could
have had dangerous consequences.
I would infer that damaging the
reputation of the College is seen as
a more serious offence than putting
yourself and others at risk.
Are Union punishments for Sports
Clubs fair?
I think the actions of both clubs
needs to be punished but I question
whether the best decision has been
made and whether the severity really
matches up with the crime.
