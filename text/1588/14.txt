Climate change is a hotter topic
than ever. The 2014 IPCC
report, hot from the press,
recommends that 80%of the world’s
power should be from low-carbon
sources by 2050. This will limit
the warming of the atmosphere to
2°C, the agreed ‘tipping point’ for
disastrous consequences.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-
Moon’s response noted ‘There is a
myth that climate action will cost
heavily’, but he commented that
‘inaction will cost much more.’
The search for sustainable solutions
to the problem of climate change
has never been so important. And
Imperial is rising to the challenge.
This term, Imperial Hub launched its
brand-new ‘Skills for Sustainability’
programme. Perhaps, though, our
biggest contribution to the cause is
the London Climate Forum, hosted
here on 22nd November.
The London Climate Forum is the
biggest student-led conference on
environmental issues in the UK. Last
year over three hundred students
attend to listen and engage with
twenty-one speakers from business,
academia and politics. This year the
conference is back, aiming to repeat
last year’s success, with a distinct
focus on solutions.
The keynote speaker, Professor Sir
Brian Hoskins, will discuss the latest
predictions. He returns to outline
what has changed in recent years
and what the scientific community
really thinks about climate change.
Professor Hoskins will weigh the
effectiveness of current initiatives
and see if we need to ramp up our
efforts locally and globally.
Michael Mathres, Co-Founder and
Director of World Climate Ltd, will
be launching the ‘Road to Paris 2015’
campaign at the forum. ‘Road to
Paris 2015’ is a new, global initiative
to tackle climate change from the
bottom up through collaboration
between the public and private
sectors. The campaign recognises that
there can be no international deal on
global emissions targets without any
agreed framework securing economic
growth and prosperity.
‘Road to Paris’ promotes green
economy solutions and is endorsed
by prominent and influential figures
including Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Through the London Climate Forum,
Imperial is privileged to be the
first university in the world to get
involved with ‘Road to Paris 2015’.
The conference will also hear from
SustainAbility, an environmental
consultancy firm focusing on
research, analysis and strategic advice
to businesses that seek to made
sustainable changes.
Alex Kirby, an environmental
journalist, will represent how the
media can be part of the solution.
Kirby is outspoken on the ongoing
problems of reporting climate news.
Even today with scientists conducting
ground-breaking research to
maximise the resources of our planet
and governments bringing in binding
new laws to reduce CO2
footprints,
journalists are facing limits on what
they can report as fact.
This conference is about the
potential impact students can have
and are already having, which is
why it is as much about discussion,
debate and interaction as hearing
from eminent speakers. As part of the
programme, the conference is hosting
a screening of ‘Sunset over Selungo’,
a new documentary on deforestation
from Ross Harrison.
‘Sunset over Selungo’ takes a look
into the everyday lives of the people
of the Penan tribe in Borneo and
documents their struggle to protect
their land from logging companies.
Ross will be hosting a Q&A after the
film screening on the ‘Penan Peace
Park’, the response of this community
to localised environmental
destruction, as well as his experiences
as a filmmaker.
Interaction will be encouraged
during the day, with workshops and
debates with exhibitors including
Climate-KIC and the UK Young
Climate Coalition. Charities and
companies will be present to discuss
their initiatives and how students
can get involved through projects,
volunteering and graduate schemes.
Climate-KIC champions student
involvement by offering business
and research opportunities. With a
similar focus UKYCC is run purely
by student volunteers but works
with those in the very top level of
government to bring about policies
directly addressing the issue of
sustainability.
However, possibly the most
valuable part of the conference is the
opportunity to talk to other students.
Consequently, delegates will not only
discuss with each other their ideas
for environmental innovation, but
will also interact with current PhD
students working at the Grantham
Institute of Climate Change and other
departments at Imperial.
If you want to be part of the
solution to climate change, we
encourage you to get involved.
Buying a ticket to the London
Climate Forum is just the first step in
saving the planet.
