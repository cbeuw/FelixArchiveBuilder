Council to call General Meeting to discuss Higher
Education Funding
Imperial College Union Council
agreed to a Union General
Meeting last Tuesday, only the
second General Meeting in five
years and the first under the new
constitution change.
A General Meeting needs 200
students to attend to meet quorum,
and can be called to discuss any topic
at any time.
The General Meeting was called
to discuss the Higher Education
Funding (HEF) policy, which has
been bouncing in and out of Council
papers since the beginning of term.
The Union wants to decide its
stance on HEF, and wishes for this
to be representative of the student
body majority preference on the
matter, however determining what
this majority preference is is causing
the issue.
The meeting was proposed via a
paper submitted by Andrew Tranter,
the postgraduate representative
for the Faculty of Natural Sciences.
The paper highlighted that despite
Council agreeing last year to a
Referendum to choose between the
three options for Higher Education
funding, this was then replaced in
a following meeting to introduce
a “non-binding” survey that is
currently open to all students to fill
in.
Alex Savell, Deputy President
(Finance and Services) is overseeing
the survey and the policy. He
explained to Felix the reasoning
behind the survey. “We ran the
survey to try and get a more thought
out response generally and find out
other opinions on subjects around the
topic.
“We want to then make a more
detailed policy from this.”
The survey will be analysed and
then the policy drawn from these will
be presented at the General Meeting.
All students present will be able
to vote to pass the policy, and add
amendments if need be, although
these too will have to be voted upon.
Continued Savell, “Once we have a
policy, we are going to then come up
with a strategy to lobby parliament
and parliamentary candidates about
our opinion on what is best.

“We aim to do this in the run up to
the general elections.”
Said Andrew Tranter on his paper
being passed, “I’m glad that council
have finally agreed to let students
have a vote on what our HE funding
policy should be. There’s a massive
lack of direct democracy in our
union, and hopefully this will go
some way to fixing that.”
Scott Heath, Union President
during the academic year spanning
2011 to 2012, called the last General
Meeting. The Meeting was held in
June of that year and was called to
discuss alterations to the constitution.
The Meeting failed to meet quorum,
with attendance numbers failing to
rise into double figures.
The debate was then taken back
to Council, again which failed to
meet quorum, so the decisions were
made over email and reported to the
following Council meeting.
The meeting will be held on
December the 1st
in Blackett Lecture
Theatre 1, although this time
currently clashes with the Royal
College of Science Union (RCSU)
Science Challenge Launch.

UNION GENERAL MEETING
1st December, 6:30PM, Blackett Lecture Theatre 1
Papers can be brought up at the meeting by emailing union.president@
imperial.ac.uk up until a week before. Papers require 1 seconder.
Ascheme which will move all
undergraduate email accounts
from the College’s data
centre to Microsoft Office 365 will
conclude today. On completion, every
Undergraduate’s mailbox will be
hosted in a Microsoft data centre, as
part of their Office 365 product. The
move promises a range of benefits,
including a mailbox fifty times larger
than what is currently offered, as well
near unlimited file storage and much
improved collaboration of Office
documents.
Whilst the end goal should prove
to be an improved experience, many
users have complained of various
issues during the migration process,
including issues syncing phones and
with passwords, as well as emails
bouncing due to the move of mailbox.
One student commented on the move
“Initially Outlook was broken on the
College machines, and now I have
to access my emails from a different
website”, with another adding “It
may be inconvenient now, but we are
getting a significant amount of extra
space”. Most do accept that they do
not like change, with comments like
“I guess we just don’t like change, but
we will adapt and grow accustomed to
the new way of accessing emails.”
John Shemilt, Imperial’s Director of
ICT (who set up Microsoft Exchange for
the College in 1997), had the following
to say on the move: “I think there is a
lot of publicity about the advantages,
unlimited file storage, vastly increased
mailbox size. We know there are some
limitations as well as advantages, but
what we need to understand, is where
you and your colleagues have issues.
Whether it is provided in house or on
the cloud there will be issues but unless
we know what they are we cannot try to
resolve them.
So if you do come across issues do
let us know via the ICT Service Desk
[service.desk@imperial.ac.uk], and we
will do all we can to resolve them with
you... we need to have the best service
possible.
This is a partnership to make sure the
students get the best value service we
can all achieve.”
The move does not stop with
undergraduates; the plan is to move all
college mailboxes to Microsoft Office
365, effectively removing College
equipment or servers from running
Microsoft Exchange.
