Mankind’s next step will be our greatest
Jack Steadman reviews what he calls Nolan’s near-perfect film
Christopher Nolan has a back
catalogue to die for. A Batman
trilogy that revived a character
left for dead by the film industry (and
in no small part helped revive a genre
that was under the threat of suffering
the same fate), a mind-bending
take on amnesia that deconstructed
conventional film structures and
one of the most incredibly original
films in decades, and that’s barely
scratching the surface.
And now here comes his biggest,
boldest undertaking yet. And going
by that list, that’s saying something.
And yet, despite all that hype – all
the images of Matthew McConaughey
in a spacesuit, exploring a new
planet, the shots of the incredible
vistas – Interstellar starts off curiously
low-key. It’s focussed – intensely
so – on the life of McConaughey’s
Cooper, a former test pilot forced to
lead a life of farming as part of the
‘caretaker generation’ of Earth: those
forced to ensure the planet ticks over
for the future, in the face of a vaguely
referenced natural disaster that saw
food stocks and sources obliterated.
Within minutes of the film’s
opening, Cooper is sat in a parent-
teacher conference (to borrow
the American phrasing) with his
children’s teachers, discussing their
respective futures; his son Tom is
ideally suited to becoming a farmer,
while his daughter Murphy – Murphy
is something else altogether.
If the concept of this, a Christopher
Nolan film about space travel and
wormholes and incredibly theoretical
physics, opening on a parent-teacher
conference sounds a little jarring
– that’s most likely because it is.
But it works. The early scenes are
tender, involving – and the acting on
display is top-notch from the start.
McConaughey’s career resurgence
continues unabated – perhaps
reaching its peak here (if not at the
start, then certainly later), while the
actors playing the two children both
deserve enormous quantities of credit
– not least Mackenzie Foy as Murphy:
an actress to watch if ever there were
one.
Eventually – inevitably – the film
expands in scope, and it does so
somewhat rapidly once Cooper comes
into contact with NASA; but it never
loses that intensely human focus.
Cooper’s goodbye to Murphy hurts,
and the video messages sent to Cooper
hurt just as much when the going gets
tough.
This is a film about grand ideals,
about physics that deals with
concepts at the very limits of our
comprehension, but it’s completely
unabashedly unafraid to stick to the
core of what it means to be human.
It even throws in a grand speech by
Anne Hathaway’s biologist Brand
about ‘love’, and how it feels like it
may just be another force, another
dimension – like gravity, or time –
that we still don’t quite understand.
Said speech on love is just one
of many similar monologues –
Interstellar shares Inception’s penchant
for incredibly exposition-heavy
dialogue, but just as there the fact that
it was exposition about something
inherently fascinating – and new –
helped carry the film through, here
Interstellar’s never-ending ambition
and drive, as well as that human
focus, forces it beyond the dialogue
into something more.
If that comparison to Inception
makes it sound like Interstellar only
borrows that one aspect from its
predecessor, don’t worry. The epic set-
pieces are in evidence here too – if not
even more so, on account of being set

(variously) in space itself or on new,
uncharted planets – as is a twisty-
turny plot that never quite lets the
audience rest back in their seats.
There’s always an underlying
tension, not least the fact that, once
the journey gets underway, Cooper
and his fellow explorers have no idea
of what they might find. And nor do
we.
Interstellar does also occasionally
borrow the bass-heavy tendencies
of Inception’s score, at times to its
detriment, but on the whole Hans
Zimmer’s score is incredible, bringing
in strains reminiscent of Kubrick’s
2001 while also retaining its own
character. Unlike that other, more
recent space-based cinematic outing
(yes, Gravity), Interstellar opts to
allow to the score to continue over
the sections set outside the shuttle
environment (although the sound
effects do drop out accordingly). It’s
a move that initially feels slightly
jarring – almost a tad inconsistent –
but it soon comes to make sense, as
the score becomes indispensable, and
the jarring cuts in the other sounds
are more than enough to achieve the
necessary contrast between ‘in’ and
‘out’.
More indispensable than the score,
though, is the cast. Nolan continues
to attract the talent – including
long-time collaborator Michael Caine
– and (as ever) it pays off in spades
here. As already noted, McConaughey
continues to shine, but it’s really
Mackenzie Foy who impresses here.
The other members of the
supporting cast are universally
excellent – Anne Hathaway brings
her A-game to a very different role
from her last outing with Nolan,
while Jessica Chastain makes an
immediate impression in her late-
game appearance (as a character
whose identity I won’t spoil here).
Another A-lister also pops up
in an unexpected role, delivering
a note-perfect performance in a
scene that elicited horrified gasps
from the audience I saw this with.
Michael Caine manages to continue
his trend of making me cry in a
Nolan film, while the likes of Casey
Affleck and John Lithgow all put in
solid performances. There are no
complaints here.
There are some in other areas
– despite my excessive praise,
Interstellar is not a perfect film (there’s
no such thing) – but it comes damn
close.
Some of the model-based shots
are obviously of models, but in a
film that manages to avoid the use
of green screen so wonderfully,
blending real-life sets seamlessly
with computer-generated visuals
(any reaction shots to the vistas were
achieved by projecting them onto
cloths for the actors to look at, rather
than just a blank green screen), a few
reasonably-but-not-perfectly realistic
shots are allowable. The final stretch
moves away from the realistic science
and into what can only be described
as “completely barmy” – but it’s so
glorious it’s impossible to really care
that it’s borderline nonsensical.
The sound mix’s occasional bass-
heavy tendencies do threaten to
drown out key dialogue, but in the
end it all adds into the thrill of the
experience, rather than taking away
from it.
And in the end, Interstellar really
is an experience. I have never been
to a film in the cinema where, at the
end, everyone burst into spontaneous
applause, followed by fevered
discussion of myriad different aspects
of what they’d just watched. I’ve never
been left physically shaking with
adrenaline, to the degree where I can’t
do anything but sit and watch the
credits. I’ve never been left so utterly
convinced I’ve just watched a master
filmmaker deliver his finest work.
The Dark Knight may well go down in
history as Nolan’s masterpiece – and
Inception as his greatest original work,
but Interstellar is the culmination of
everything he learned on those and all
his other films. It is the culmination
of making some of the defining films
of the century, and because of that, it
is utterly, utterly glorious.
