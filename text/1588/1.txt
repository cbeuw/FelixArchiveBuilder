Early proposals cause confusion
amongst students at Silwood
Apetition to “Protect Silwood
from losing its identity” has
amassed over 250 signatures,
after it has been announced that
redevelopment work on the site is to
take place. However, with no straight
answers yet available as to what this
redevelopment may entail, rumours
are running rife through the student
body based at the campus.
The redevelopment work in
question is still in its very early
stages, and reportedly cannot start
until the nuclear reactor based on the
site is completely decommissioned,
which won’t be until 2016. However,
with parts of the Silwood site already
closed off to students, concerns
are mounting as to what the
redevelopments may be.
Due to the Manor house on
site being a listed building, Felix
has been told that it may not be
demolished but may be rented out
as luxury apartments, although this
has not been confirmed. There are
also worries that more buildings
may be placed on the green belt,
although again this too has not been
confirmed.
The Manor house on the campus
is already off limits to students after
being closed at the beginning of the
summer. Previously, the Manor
house was used for large social events
and a conservatory was utilised for
coffee breaks in the morning. It
sits in the centre of Silwood Park,
overlooking a lot of the greenery of
the surrounding campus.
However, these facilities have now
been moved to buildings elsewhere on
the site and students are concerned
that having private residents live in
the centre of a student campus may
detract from the students being able
to enjoy their campus in peace.
