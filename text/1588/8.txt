Ateam of students from
the Department of
Bioengineering have
augmented a sports wheelchair in
order to enable disabled athletes to
re-right themselves back on their
wheels after a crash. Jacqueline
Beddoe-Rosendo, Bianca de Blasi
and Simone Castagno developed
the prototype during a UROP this
summer, which caters to wheelchair
basketball athletes and potentially
other athletes of high-impact sports
such as wheelchair rugby. The
technology has been trialled with
members of the London Titans
wheelchair basketball team, who the
team extensively consulted with over
the course of the project.
Their solution consists of a simple
rigid metal roller with a rubber
casing attached to the front bumper
of a sports wheelchair, which rotates
in only one direction. Containing a
clutch mechanism and coated with
anti-slip PVC tape, this is designed
to provide a lockable pivot point
between the front bumper and the
floor. This allows the player to push
themselves up and resume playing in
less time.
Bianca de Blasi, in her 4th
year of
Bioengineering, cites the durability,
ease of use and simple replacement/
maintenance of the roller. “More
importantly, it also fits with
wheelchair basketball regulations –
for example, the tape that we put on
the roller does not leave marks on the
basketball court.”
The team also made a video, which
has been published on the Imperial
news website, demonstrating how the
roller works in two different cases:
athletes who have weaker upper arm
strength (and cannot push themselves
up) due to having no abdominal
control, and athletes who do have
some abdominal control. This
variation is due to the varying degrees
of spinal cord injury (and therefore
paralysis) present in different
wheelchair athletes.
In the video, Jacqueline Beddoe-
Rosendo, also in her 4th year of
Bioengineering, explained the
challenges that wheelchair basketball
athletes face. “During matches,
collisions are very frequent and these
often lead to players toppling over.
These cause disruptions to the game
because in many cases, these players

Union’s Annual Report celebrates a succesful year
PHILIP KENT
Earlier this week, the Union
released the 2013/14 Annual
Report. This document,
prepared by Union managers and
officer trustees, provides a summary
of the activities of the Union over the
last financial year.
As with previous editions, the
report was opened by the exiting
Union President, in this instance
David Goldsmith.
In his opening statement, David
highlighted the Union’s main
achievements from last year.
Opening with the Union’s successful
lobbying of the House of Lords over
the Immigration Bill, he continued
onto the Residential Experience
Review and Student Academic Choice
Awards.
Meanwhile, Chair of the Board
of Trustees Dame Julia Higgins
praised the Union’s new governance
arrangements as brought in as part of
the new constitution.
Aside from detailed coverage of the
Union’s achievements and statistics
over the past financial year, which
also included the Representation
Conference and improved
satisfaction in the Union survey,
coverage has also been given to the
Union’s plans for this financial year.
As the year is still in its infancy,
it gives some insight as to what the
Union has planned going forward.
These include new “exit interview”
and “development plan” schemes to
increase the support given to Club,
Society & Project (CSP) officers, a new
report on “diversity, inclusion, and
liberation”, expansion of customer
promises, and proposals from a
Democracy Review by March 2015.
The Annual Report also contains
the Union’s financial statements,
which are produced and audited each
year in line with Charity Commission
guidelines.
This year, the Union reported an
overall profit of around £55,000,
although this is partially due to an
increase in grant from College and an
increased value of the services College
provide free of charge to the Union.
Once CSP finances have been
excluded, as they are held in a
restricted fund separate from other
operations, the actual profit is closer
to £160,000.
Expenditure has hugely increased
in the activity of “Social Enterprise” –
a somewhat arbitrary label referring
to the bars and retail outlets. This
year, the Union’s commercial
operations have run at a loss almost
twice the value of last year’s, being
subsidised by other operations,
although this is likely due to an
increase (of 23) in the number of
student staff.
In a welcome page to the report, the
Union’s Managing Director noted
that “Together we have taken the
Union from a precarious position
in 2011 to an organisation with a
strong balance sheet, three successive
years of strong surpluses and a clear
vision for the financial future for
the organisation,” reflecting the
significant improvements the Union
has made financially since a number
of deficits in the early part of the
decade.
The report is available for download
from the Union’s website.

cannot right themselves.”
Wheelchair basketball athletes are
strapped into the wheelchair and
often have the ability to move it into
a frontal position in the event of a
crash, but find it difficult to push the
wheelchair upright by themselves
because of the way they are currently
designed. At present, players often
rely on officials to stop the match
clock during a collision and bring
external assistance in order to re-
right them, or for other players to
stop playing and help them up. This
is often time-consuming and disrupts
the flow of the game.
The UROP itself was a spin-off
from a second year Bioengineering
Group Design Project in the 2012/13
academic year, which the three
previously worked on as part of a
larger group with a number of other
coursemates.
An initial prototype, which utilized
different attachment methods and
dark sandpaper, was first produced
by the larger group, which was also
demonstrated at the 2013 Imperial
Festival. The final prototype
produced by Beddoe-Rosendo,
de Blasi and Castagno solves the
issues that the first one faced with
regulation compliance (sandpaper
would damage the rink flooring),
as well as the durability of device
attachments and materials.
Both the group design projects (part
of the second-year Bioengineering
curriculum) and the UROP are part
of the five-year Rio Tinto-sponsored
Sports Innovation Challenge. Now
in its third year, the challenge aims
to widen the accessibility of sports to
disabled athletes, as well as improve
the training and competition
equipment available to them, by
harnessing the skills and creativity
of Imperial students. To speed up
the process of bringing their product
to market, the team is approaching
sports wheelchair manufacturers and
offering their technology for free as a
philanthropic gesture.
Now a graduate student in
Imperial’s Department of Medicine,
Simone Castagno said: “We want to
empower players who compete in
wheelchair sports, so that they don’t
have to rely on others to get them
upright and in back in the game.
Ultimately, we hope to see our device
being used by sportspeople in the
near future.”
