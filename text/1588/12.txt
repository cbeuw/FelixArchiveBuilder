Bernadett: Where are you from
and do you think it affected your
outlook of Imperial?
Tom: In a very positive way, yes! I am
from Salcombe in south Devon. The
international population at Imperial
has always been very stimulating for
me. I went from a very un-diverse
community to meeting people at
Imperial who are from fascinating
places.
B: How representative do you
think this year’s sabb team is of
the general student population of
Imperial?
T: I’m excited we have a postgraduate
research student, Alex, as an officer
trustee, because we have a massive
postgraduate population. We also
have Philippa, the Felix editor, who
was a taught postgrad student. In
terms of the international aspect,
we don’t have any non-EU students
as sabbs. We are always looking to
diversify, but we have no input into
who runs and who is elected in the
Union elections.
In terms of gender, although
the 35:56 girl to boy ratio is not
represented this year, it’s not
massively far off, and this year is
kind of an anomaly. The biggest
concern is the lack of international
students.
B: How do you think you’ll address
this issue?
T: We’re trying to increase
engagement. We do have a high
level of engagement with our
international students because a lot
of them are members of overseas
clubs. However, there is an issue
because international students don’t
tend to run for sabbatical positions.
This may be because their degree
seems like more of an investment
because of the higher fees, so they
would prefer to do their degree then
get a high-salary job straight away.
I think it’s a shame; I’d like to see
more international students run in
the elections.
B: But do you not think because
they are paying so much more,
they would expect higher quality
education and clubs and welfare?
T: I’d like to think that was a part
of it, but the awareness of how
much their degrees are costing is
too much… But it’d be great if they
had more input into how we could
improve how their courses are run.
I would like to help improve things
for international students, but
it is difficult, because I’m not an
international student myself, I don’t
have as thorough understanding as
they do.
B: What do you think about the
sabb salary? Especially after Chris
said it was too high?
T: I have a lot of respect for Chris
for donating a third of his salary.
I couldn’t afford to do that myself
because I’ve accumulated a lot of
credit card bills throughout my three
years at Imperial, because I couldn’t
afford to live in London. So I’m
paying those off now.
It’s also a combination of living in
London and wanting to do as much
as I can. If you look at what our
salary works out to be, it works out
to be in total mid to low £20,000,
including living allowance. Whereas
I think the average Imperial graduate
salary is around £28,000, so sabbs
are getting paid less than what we
could expect to get.
I had a job offer from Deutsche
Bank before I decided that I wanted
to do this instead. I didn’t turn it
down for money, but because I didn’t
want to go into that industry and
I wanted to do more and change
here. I think I would have a better
experience here.
B: So what do you want to do after
your sabb year?
T: I’m going to hopefully go and do a
postgraduate medicine degree.
B: Pff, woah! That is totally
different to banking! Did you
always want to run for a sabbatical
position?
T: I was always very envious of the
people who had the courage to run,
to put themselves in a public forum
so open to judgement and criticism. I
didn’t think I had it in me.
Also, because I was in my final year
with my friends, I didn’t think my
friends would have enough time to
help me. I was looking at the option
of running for president and it was
