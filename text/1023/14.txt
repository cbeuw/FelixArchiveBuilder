The FELIXGATE Diaries Part 2
The path to power is full
of many things but what
makes most grown
candidates cry is the St.
Mary's custard pie. Last
year it was like this...
Day 13, 9:3:94
Not really a qualifying day. Owain puts
up his new poster; it has his face as a jigsaw
puzzle with the caption, "Put the pieces into
place..." underneath. Owain likes it because
there's a nice oppressive use of his face and
the fact that he doesn't look like a girl. He
tries to make me go and pile flesh again -
tonight it's Selkirk and Tizard - but I'd
rather go home and watch the football.
H e has his 'editorial first lady' for
support at least. *
Day 14,10:3:94
Today is the foamy one; St
Mary's hustings. We get booked on
the union minibus at 5.15 and head
over the Serpentine with a very
nervous group of prospective sabs,
most of whom are getting as drunk as
possible. In a prophetic way Dan Look
gets his glass removed from h i m so
inclined is he to its temptation.
The conversation ranges from root canal
work to vomit and the effect of bananas on a
queasy stomach. A dozen queasy stomachs
immediately smell bananas and lurch in time
to the DP's driving. Owain says how glad he is
to have come by minibus. M y scepticism
reaches a high.
Finally we're allowed out and the smell
of bananas is replaced by the fumes of Praed
Street. We get into Mary's bar and Owain is
straight into mode - you're less vulnerable on
the move is his theory - so he starts putting
posters up.
Slowly the room fills up to 20%. It's
already past 6 and there's still more IC people
here than Mary's. I think we should go for it
and at least keep our skins. Unfortunately the
Mary's President [Marc Swan] goes to drum
up hecklers and we wait for another 20
minutes. It's invaluable time for D a n to
ingratiate himself with the barman. 'Oh what
a lovely pint, I think I'll have another.' Owain
parades around, handing out flyers and
smiling nicely. He's so pat he just keeps going.
T h e n the pre-clinicals wander i n .
They're a hardened, confident bunch - all talk
of sphincters and smears. Someone asks me
who's wearing contacts, not that he really
wants to know. I get the feeling it's just the
preyer cornering the hunted early on. Finally
all is set up. The beefy medics are as far back
as possible so they can shout more loudly it
seems.
Another nervous proposer's speech is
over quickly. Owain is heckled on his
feminine side - a woman's section to FELIX
is proposed. Owainfieldsthese early bouncers
with a flourish and we go out in a cloud of
satisfaction. Joe gets up and is immediately
flanned!
Post McFadden, it's question time.
Owain trundles down the front to meet a flan;
now that the destroying team is organised. I
stay well back and protect my goatee. The
questions are pointed but well defended until
a query about chromosomes. A medic comes
forward with a hypodermic and a colleague
gets Owain's arm for a impromptu blood test.
They don't want to vote for a transvestite but
the suggestion of just dropping his/her
trousers is ignored. Only the 'ethical'
intervention of Mary's President saves our
herafrom his fate.
Day 18,14:3:94,firstday of voting
Joe is not seen all day and Owain
becomes increasingly concerned about what
he's doing. A lot of the Science
Communicators appear to be out of bounds,
charging up to people and asking them
questions to get them to vote for Joe. I walk
around looking for various friends doing the
same thing for Owain. I only manage nine.
Owain wants me to get out there and get more
people to vote for h i m but I'm not happy
doing that and, the closest w
e been to an
argument looms. I can see his means-end
rationale but I'm really not interested. If Joe
should win, good luck to him - the college will
get what it voted for. Personally I think Owain
will win by about 200 votes.
Owain even persuades Paul that he is
about to lose and the pair charge around
canvassing like mad. Owain caiis me a
"juvenile living in a fantasy world" which
doesn't really bother me but by the end of the
day there's enough panic around to float the
Titantic.
Day 19,15:3:94.
second day of voting
I don't s
e
e Owain until 4.50.
He's out and about talking to a
punter. Paul is working another bit
of the walkway. A n d y Wensley
rushes past, pausing only to say
that results a
r
e due a
t 10.30 and
00.
In the office things are
nervous - even I have butterflies.
Owain doesn't turn up until 7ish.

fazed. He thinks h
e has lost. So does
Owain. I don't g

t into the bar until
lOish and am immediately forced to buy
a round. Owain is s

g through the
crowds quoting Shakespeare, speaking
earnestly to people he has never met,
fluttering his eyelashes - totally drunk. A l l the
other candidates are equally wetted. Only
Maria looks unconcerned, perched on a stool,
red wine in hand. Dan is floating. Ian starts to
get rowdy.
We sit in t
h
e bar from 10 to 11.30. On
occasions Dave Goddard [DP] c

tell us; "not long", "only ten minutes", "only
five minutes". We get thrown out of the bar
into the lounge. Finally at 11.45 a g

candidates are asked to go upstairs.
Hush
Andy W comes down to give out the
results. President is first - it's just a blur of
numbers. H o w could Paul Thomas do so
badly? What were the n
e
w election figures?
No-one can believe Lucy has won except for
the three people who cheer. I look around and
Owain is sitting with a Cheshire c

t on his
shoulders. I know it's all over. Q
