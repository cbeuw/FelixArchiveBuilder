There aren't any films
on at ICU this week, so
find a comfortable chair,
close you eyes and let
me tell you a story.
Once upon a cliche
there was a handsome
young man. He was
polite and hard working
but also rather too
philosophical for his own
good. His genuine
efforts to strive for mate-
rial gain and empirical
knowledge as society
requires were often
thwarted by his unusual-
ly enlightened princi-
ples. He would spent
hours pursuing sponta-
neous motives of artistic
projects and new idealis-
tic theories. He read
poetry and wrote for
newspapers with a
sound ethical basis and
all the time his studies
languished and his mon-
etary desire dwindled.
