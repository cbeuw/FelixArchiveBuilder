u sita [1893]
o
Another week, another game of hit and miss in rotation. This
week Matt Booth mans the station and calls the shots...
A frightening vision opens up before Marcus Alexander as he
ventures to the Royal Academy's exhibition of the
presurrealist Odilon Redon.
Tintin sits back, rubs his lucky teddy and undergoes the trial
by question that is quiz show. Jenny Ho receives an stateside
letter, well a postcard from america to be precise while
Tony Grew swings from tree to tree with rudyard kipling's
the jungle book.
Following on from last week, tintin double bills with velo-
deluxe and drugstore, whilst Vik looks back over it bites'
greatest hits. Joe munches through salad live and Helen-
Louise wraps up dealing with live's album, throwing copper.
Always ready to give advice where it's needed, Fiona
suggests accessories for some sabbatical candidates and
dances round her hand bag - in the best possible taste!
D rotation:still circular
This week give a big rotation
welcome to Matt Booth of
Physics 1. Matt lists his interests
as wearing odd socks, rugby
shirts and eating nothing red.
Roll 'em away Matt...
judy cheeks - the time
Absolutely crap. This is the
standard chart garbage that you
hear blared across Capital FM
all day.
salad - drink the elixir
This is a sinister song.
The guitaring is strong with
occasional raucous breaks. With
the moody vocals added this is
definitely one of the better indie
releases around at the moment.
8 storey window - i will
An unspectacular lightweight
grungy release which improves
little on subsequent plays.
Tracks 2 & 3 , recorded live at
BBC Radio Wales, are about as
exciting as that sound.
bandit queen
- give it to the dog
The title says if all. This just
seems like a piss poor 'seether'
(Veruca Salt) impression.
the cardigans - sick and tired
Enchanting vocals and an
abundance of woodwind
instruments go towards making
a lovely song. All four tracks are
fairly bouncy and yetescape
being tackily upbeat. The
superb chord changes result in
an overall reflective mood.
faith no more
- digging the grave
Not one of their better songs. It
progressing from singing
through shouting to screaming.
The i. static and the
drumming leaves little to the
imagination.
transcendental love machine
Slills: - satellite
The background is a fine piece
of ambience in an Australiana-
like style but the vocals are far
too prominent and spoil it
chord mix (track 2) is an
impressive trance offering and
the fourth t<a mind
shattering 21 and a bit minutes.
radiohead - high and dry
A fairly typical popular indie
ballad. It makes good use of
acoustic guitar, giving an
overal t. The
supporting tracks are bland, run
of the mill stuff. Well worth a
listen though
gun - the only one
I think these boys ought to stick.
to covering old Cameo songs.
the bucketheads
- the bomb
This is Seventies disco back-
ground with plenty of trumpets
and bongos thrown in for good
to the feel but the song is
unimpressive.
detached and obscure
O d i l o n Redon was an artist
haunted by the touch of insanity. A
little known French painter from the
late 19th century, and a
contemporary of many of the
famous impressionists, much of
Redon's work is now on show at the
Royal Academy. Inspired by writers
such as Poe and Baudelaire, his
work is imbued with a disturbing,
nightmarish taint of unreality.
For most of his life he spurned
the use of paint, preferring to
scratch and score at paper with
charcoal, leaving rough, sooty
images from his fantastical mind.
Figures drift and cower beneath
blackened, looming landscapes
whilst his lurid notions of angels
float above. Characters from stories
pose bleakly, grim and meta-
morphosed by the dreams that
surround them. Above all, the
image that recurs is that of the
disembodied head. It flies past,
winged and grimacing; it soars
above the land, spherical as the
moon, or sits, transmuted into a
spider. This image, redolent of the
artist's own memories of his father
being beheaded, haunts almost all
of these burnt out landscapes.
More accomplished, yet in
many ways less interesting, are
Redon's later works in colour. On
show are some skillful pastel still
lives of flowers, wherein the colour
is used in an almost childish
manner; boldly vibrant, with pure
tones shimmering in wild splashes
about the picture. His enigmatic
visions, when translated into
colour, lose their ominous sense of
foreboding, gaining instead an
overpowering luminosity. Whilst
they are stunningly visual, these
colour pictures lose their sense of
spirituality in their shamelessly
tinted tones.
Overall Redon's art leaves you
with a mixture of wonder and
doubt. It is intriguing and deeply
sinister, but it doesn't have the
power behind it to be thought of as
really great, or very lasting. Redon
was an anomaly, an intriguing one
at that; but nothing more. 0
