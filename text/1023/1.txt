Flans Fly in Mary's Mayhem
K M
The ritual flanning of sabbatical candidates and their proposers was again carried out in earnest this week, writes Andrew Tseng. At hustings w
last Monday and Wednesday, sabbatical candidates subjected themselves to intense scrutiny by those present. Mary's issues, the new Ba
building and the forthcoming merger with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, were of particular concern both north and south
issues raised included the proposed move of Imperial College Union to the Sherfield building and the NUS.
King's President May Lie Again
B Y A N D R E W S M I T H
F o l l o w i n g a veiled attack on
Lucy Chothia, I C U President,
Ghassan Karian, King's Student
U n i o n President, has been
elected President of the
University of L o n d o n U n i o n
(ULU) by 52 votes to 18.
The dramatic events took
place at a meeting of U L U ' s
General Union Council, in which
U L U sabbaticals were elected.
Opening Tuesday's meeting, an
anonymous statement was read
by the chair which implied that
Ms Chothia had been slandering
one of the candidates. T h e
statement, which could not be
contested or debated, continued
by suggesting that everything the
ICU President said could not be
trusted.
Speaking to F E L I X , Lucy
Chothia denied the allegations.
However, senior union officials
are concerned that recent events
involving Ghassan Karian and
L u c y Chothia, may have a
detrimental effect on relations
between I C U , K i n g ' s Student
Union and U L U next year.
After recent events involving
the K i n g ' s President and his
executive collectively lying to
I C U , the prospective U L U
President was asked to explain
what conditions would lead him
to lie in his new role. Querying
the relevance of the question to
his election and its effect on the
voters M r Karian admitted that
he would on occasion tell "fibs"
though he insisted that he would
attempt to tell the truth as often
as possible.
Earlier the only contested
post, that of Vice President
(Finance & Societies), went to
another King's sabbatical. Tara
Jefferson, among whose
nominators was Ian Parish, I C U
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies), beat her rival Caroline
Bright for one of the two other
U L U sabbatical posts.
O n l y one of the ten un-
contested posts was reopened for
nominations, and that happened
at the end of the three hour
council meeting. Charles Anglin,
the only candidate for Chair of
the G U C , and supported by the
Presidents of L S E , U C L and
K i n g ' s , was convincingly
defeated but the decisive manner
shocked those present.
A photographer was present
throughout the meeting, but after
the announcement of the new
U L U President's election the
formerly media friendly M r
K a r i a n refused to speak to a
journalist present.
