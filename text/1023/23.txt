I C v s U M D S 0
After an eventful journey due to
UMDS's captain arranging to
meet us at the wrong station we
eventually found the opposition.
As darkness was rapidly
approaching we agreed to play 40
minutes (instead of an hour).
However little did we know that
their unqualified, non-neutral
umpire had an inability to keep
time. Much to our surprise the
half time whistle was blown after
what could only have been 10
minutes. The second half was also
suspiciously short. Even so we
managed to comprehensively beat
UMDS without ever getting a
chance to really get into the game.
We could have done with a better
match as practice for the London
CURs«ni-finals this weekend, but
nevertheless well played everyone.
ICvs London Hospital 0
Imperial College are set to
attempt the league and cup dou-
ble this week after beating the
London Hospital in the semi-
finals of the London Colleges cup.
It was a close fought game with
our usualflashesof brilliance
mixed with spells of awful pass-
ing. The shooting was very accu-
rate, despite the London's very
tall defence and our tight defence
meant that they did not get many
chances to pull back.
A special mention goes to our
four supporters - unheard of for
the netball club, especially at an

ICvs St. Mary's 0
On a sunny Wednesday after-
noon, we played our last league
match of the season, all Imperial
as it turned out! Wefinishedoff a
very successful year with a pretty
convincing win over the medics!
Generally speaking, the match
was very enjoyable, with impres-
sive netball by IC, putting into
use all we had learnt in training.
What more can we say but
well played and remember every-

We've got talent, we've got style,
We've got the will.
We never thought a win could, mean so much, as now,
Their oppositionforward, really was, an utter cow!
We have to score loads, every night (?!), every day.
We wouldn't be happier any other way.

ICMenvsUCL
IC maintained their challenge for
league and glory with a hard
fought win over a strong team.
Both teams went close in the first
twenty minutes but IC were
rewarded for their cavalier attack-
ing style with a Dan Loureda
goal midway through the half. IC
then started to dominate at the
back and it was only due to some
poorfinishingon our part that
the score was still 1-0 at half time.
Mike and Jarvis doubled our
lead with a superb strike soon
into the second half. A defensive,
lapse allowed UCL to pull one
back but we heldfirmto pick up
our 22nd point out of 26. Last sea-
son this would have won us the
title, however Hollowaycan still
beat us if they win all their games
in hand.
This Sunday we take on
Goldsmiths in the sup semi-final.
Thefinalis the following
Saturday aftenoon, so ifwe get
through any support would be
much appreciated.
Rugby EI
IC Ladies vs Choring Cross (league)
With our backs playing superbly,
Cross (as they call themselves)
had little hope of possession once
the ball got out to them (the
backs). Consequently, Katie
scored four tries on the wing,
with a converted try by Emma,
one by centre Cathy and by
scrum half Sian.
Sheer determination of the
forwards on the Cross line pro-
duced tries by Mel and Lynsey
(flanker & No. 8).
Forward and idiot (for a
dodgy pass) of the match was Mel
and (surprisingly) back of the
match was Katie.
Congratulations to the entire
team for again playing some
excellent rugby. Let's move even
further up the league. Well done.

IC4thvsUM0S3rd
Alter lheir surprising defeat at the
hands of Kings last week the 4th
team regained their form with a
good.win over UMDS 3 (United
Medical arid Dentist Schools) on
Monday night. Captain Garry
won comfortably in three straight
games, and Dave soon followed
winning in four 3-1 after a slight
hiccup in the 3rd game. Alex
recovered from losing the first
game of his match to win through
cofnfortably in the end 3-1. The
plie disappointment of the
evening was the news that
Richard had been injured in a
motor bike accident over the
weekend and was unable to play.
Thus the game had to be given to
UMDS. Get well soon Richard!
The league now looks very
tight at the top but the IC 4th's
are still confident they can gain
promotion this season and go on
to bigger and better things in the
future!
