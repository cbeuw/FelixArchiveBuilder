Standby

hyperize
velo-deiuxe come out like a band
on fire. John Strohm mutters
something inaudible into the mic,
which considering we're all
standing within ten metres seems
to be a waste of time, and then
they start. After that verbal
smudging he doesn't talk much in
between songs. Indeed Velo-deluxe
seem instead to group them into
pairs and just play them into each
other. It's a whirlwind performance
that enlivens the tracks from their
new album 'superelastic'. However
the highlight of the set is a song
not available there which concerns
lobsters (in a roundabout way), and
is cut from the cloth of a ballad but
tailored to the shape of an indie
anthem.
The band that follow know all
about anthems. Every drugstore
single from 'modern pleasure' to
'nectarine' has summoned up some
sort of universal lifeline.
On the small pub stage, they
seemed to have control over both
their material and the crowd that
belied the tottering characters in
their songs. You even get the
impression that they're in control of
their lives too as Isabel breaks into
confessional mode. She tells us
how the record company wants
them to promote the album coming
out next month before going on to
explain how they're going to play
some tracks from their 'second
album' instead. But no matter what
album was invoked, everything they
played was a seamless weave
tasting of cheap red wine drunk
with the best intentions. And under
the influence Drugstore kicked
effortless between their two modes
of operation; slow and fast. Unlike
most other bands however they
applied both within songs not on
alternate songs.
After many urgings they finally
played what is perhaps their most
famous song; the Flaming Lips'
'she don't use jelly'. It's a real joke
affair, confusing jam and vaseline,
tissues and magazines, lead singers
and tone deaf guitarists, but unlike
the guy who was standing behind
me don't confuse that for the real
Drugstore. If you do, the surprise
will be on you. At the moment you
could be forgiven for placing
Drugstore in the pack of
'couldbees'. Come March you
won't see them for wannabees.

aspires to? I wonder because there
is a pernicious theory currently
circulating within these once
esteemed confines. It states that if
most of the popular press has said
a band is bad than they must be.
Well, excuse me for having an
opinion but I don't care one jot
what any journalist (or anyone else
for that matter) tells me to believe
and, at the risk of telling you what
to do, you probably shouldn't be
swayed by this review either. All I
want to say is that if I like a band
then it's because their music moves
me, touches me in places where
no-one but my nearest and dearest
could hope to reach, gives me a
reason to have ears...
Which brings me to it bites, a
band who have done these things
to me and for me more than any
other band. So what if the popular
music press tried to crucify them?
When the drop-dead gorgeous
guitar riff to 'still too young to
remember' erupts into life, what
possible reason can I have not to
follow?
So what if they were dumped
by the trendy papers for supposedly
peddling out-dated, pseudo-
progressive rock? Listen to the
bitter, snarling four minute diatribe
of 'murder of the planet earth'
which contains the immortal line,
"it still is untrendy to be a friend of
the earth" and chew on the irony.
Take the strains of 'kiss like
judas' and 'midnight' and try to
point me in the direction of another
rock band that are so meaningful,
articulate, creative and unique.
It Bites were special, at least to
me (and judging by the sold-out
venues around the country for ex-
frontman Francis Dunnery's solo
shows, to more than a few
thousand others). I'm not living in
any time zone other than the here
and now - I'm just giving an
unashamedly admiring opinion of a
best of... collection that sounds
fresh, free from gimmicks, and
most of all, challenging. And for
that it gets an unashamed (10).
I'm looking for an angle, a
frame to hang it all in: musos have
to think like that, it's not enough to
be there, we have to analyse and
dissect the music. Like all good liars
we know that raw experience is just
rabbit food compared to the
waldorf salad of nostalgic
reminiscence. Or to put it another
way: we love music so much that
we have to turn the live event into
dead copy, bludgeoned into
submission by the slings and arrows
of outrageous writing (we're all of
us vultures at heart).
Or put it a third and plainer
way: when you've read one gig
review you've read them all; it's
opinion dressed up as scripture -
the same promiscuous fervour, as if
enthusiasm is a disease that's
catching - and the best it can hope
for is to say nothing prettily.
Yes, yes, you cry, a trifle
impatiently, but could I please get
on with it and say something, like
what the band were actually like?
At which point I can only lie back
and think of Elvis, like a good little
muso whore.
salad are a nice band. They
sound nice, they look nice
(particularly the singer Marijne),
they wear nice clothes. They have
lots of songs I don't the words to
and some of them have tunes and
everything ... OK, OK, I'm not
being not entirely fair, since the
single 'drink the elixir' is pretty
catchy (they play it first, which says
something) and on the whole the
gig was lots of fun and, well, nice.
But then what do I know, just
because I was there? Hang all
music journalists now - you have
only your pretensions to lose.
live are being hyped by the
rock press as "the next big thing".
All the quotes on the cover of their
new album, throwing copper, use
words like "impressive". Listening
to this myself, I thought "first track
... good, second track ... good,
third track ... hey are there only two
tracks here?" Yes, this album is
impressive - I'm impressed by the
number of times they manage to
recycle the same riff! Live suffer
from that eternal problem of
excellent lyrics with boring non-
diverse music.
After playing this for a while I
had to check the track number on
my cd player 'cos all the songs
sounded the same. And not only
that, they all sound like Soul
Asylum sung by Michael Stipe. How
much did they bribe the 'famous'
magazines to give them 5/5 ? I
give them 5/10 - unless, of course,
they're better live (groan). 0
