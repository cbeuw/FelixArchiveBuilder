Frater Fiam writes
Your good Frater is full aware that
drugs and other usefully affective
substances may be purchased quite
legally, and without recourse to
dangerous activities. Indeed, there
is a vendor who trades quite
openly not more than a few
minutes walk from your very own
place of study. It was intended that
I should deliver a brief report upon
Caiha edulis, and the uses thereof.
But before my plans could exceed
potentiality I was provided with
another, far less costly, method of
physical and mental affectance.
Why, I say, should one seek
chemical pleasures, when there are
biological alternatives which can
provide a mental influence lasting
days, rather than hours? Such
genetic implants have no
hangover, but provide a thankful
and easing period of recovery.
Does my Frater hear his disciples
clamouring for explanation?
Where, they ask, can I find such
devices? The answer is simple. Just
wait to be given one; you needn't
even ask. These agents are, of
course, those humble viruses that
affect the mind and body most
profoundly. Your Frater is
labouring under the influence, as it
were, of one which provides the
common cold.
Now please do not allow me
to prevent you from listing the
harm caused by such creatures - I
shall grant that they are
e s s e n t i a l l y
debilitating, but
such also are
the more
w o r t h y
d r u g s .
However,
t h i s
debilitat-
ion can
sometimes
p r o v i d e
useful effects.
With the body
in a state of minor
collapse, the mind
can become more attuned,
more receptive of its own psychic
(and psychotic) elements. It is more
freed, more liable to reach beyond
normality. Such is the lesson for
this week.

She got on the tube at Vauxhall
and sat down opposite me, a big
girl in big boots. It was
these that attracted
my attention: see-
through plastic
Doc Martens.
With fake
gold trim. I
did a double
take. But
no, I wasn't
i m a g i n i n g
things and
yes, you could
see the sweat
glistening on
every little hair on
her plump pink toes. It
was almost love at first sight
but then I realised this wasn't a
brilliantly iconoclastic anti-fashion
statement - the poor dear actually
thought the boots looked good. Or,
more accurately, had been so
informed by the many-headed
medusa of the fashion media.
Maybe they were right.
It used to be so easy to be
unfashionable. As a kid you didn't
even have to think about it; your
mum bought all your clothes and
cut your hair and voila - instant
geekdom. But then, at some
unspecified point on the magical
mystery tour of adolescence -
somewhere between the pictur-
esque delights of Pubichairsville
and Self-abuse City - we decided
that Enough was Enough. It was
time to take our sartorial destiny
into our own hands. If we were
going to look stupid, it might as
well be a stupid look of our choice.
And choose we did. Anyone
remember shell-suits? Or Flat-
tops? Or cerise shoes? It's no use
saying they made you do it - we
KNOW you thought it looked cool.
Those were they days when going
to school with the wrong haircut or
clothes was tantamount to a
confession of geekdom to the
Fashion Inquisition. It didn't matter
if the orthodox look of the day was
impractical, expensive or just plain
ugly - you had to have it. And
fashion is the most alluring of
religions because its command-
ments have a limited shelf-life - if
you don't like this style, just hold
on, there'll be another one along
in a minute.
