Consoc... Blue Humour... Gliding: We struggle for the truth...
Sorry
Dear Felix,
I am writing this letter to apologise
to ICU office for unfairly blaming
them for the 'Gormangate' mishap
of two weeks ago. I now have the
full facts of the incident and accept
that the fault does not lie with
them. I apologise. I still however
do not accept that the cause of the
problem was the 'sheer ineptitude'
of Consoc. The fact remains that
Mrs Gorman's office telephoned at
3pm on the proceeding day to tell
us that she may or may not be
coming to speak. A message which
was not passed on to Consoc
through the fault of no-one.
Yours Sincerely
Richard M . Phillips

Dear Owain,
Re: Blue
While a lot has been said about
Klein, his poor mother has not got
a mention. She was a poor sufferer
who constantly had her bath
sponges stolen and dipped in blue
ink. In "Klein and his Women" the
Chicago cultural theorist Camille
Levy-Ersberg recounts the incident
when, in protest at the constant
pilferage of her washing up
material, Mme. Klein dyed all
Klein's shirts red. Whether this had
any impact on Klein's late Mono-
chrome period and his
experiments with fire can only be
speculated. Levy-Ersberg also
mentions the final insult that Mme.
Klein paid to Klein when she threw
out all the household sponges and
bought an automatic dishwasher.
Towards the end of his fine
piece, Marcus asks rhetorically
"Can science ever hope to answer
my questions?". Probably not but
one thing it definitely can't do is to
convince beautiful, naked women
to cavort and rub IK8 on
themselves. For that, if not for
anything else, we have M. Yves
Klein to thank.

Dear Felix,
I would like to correct some errors
made in the last Felix concerning
the Imperial College Gliding Club.
On the front page of the last
edition was a picture of our new
glider (well some of it!) and a few
details of prices The annual
membership is £29 as stated but
an average flight will cost around
£5 (not £18 as stated in Felix).
Students normally have three
instructional flights in a row on any
one day. We are looking for new
members but unfortunately your
first flight will cost £18. You can
come down and have a flight and
be under no obligation to join. If
you do decide to join you will
receive subsidy on the £18 trial
flight cost. Once solo the costs of
gliding drop even further - you can
take a launch in the morning and
stay up in the air all day for
around £ 1 5 only. Come along to
our Thursday lunchtime meetings if
interested at 1 pm in Aero 266 or
e-mail a.fowler @ic.ac.uk.

It is wonderful to have free
publicity, especially on your front
page. However, I guess someone
got their wires crossed somewhere.
The average cost of a training
flight is more like 4 pounds, not
18. This makes gliding compare
Edited this week by Owain
infinitely more favourably with a
night out on the booze.
The main point of this letter is
that the cost is not a serious
problem in student gliding. The
Union subsidises all our flying and
so you can have a superb
introduction to the world of the
birds. Most of our new members fly
every second or third weekend.
Spring is probably the best time
to learn to fly as the weather is
starting to improve, plus we are
running a special offer again this
year, if you join the club, we give
you a free trial flight.
If anybody is interested in
learning to fly, or just wants to find
out more about us and what it's
like to spend your weekends
soaring for hours above England,
with nothing but the birds for
company, come along to any one
of our regular meetings, thursday
at 1 pm in aero 266 or e-mail me
to find out more.

Well, it's election time again, and
the college is filled with the false
promises of another bunch of
sycophantic posturers. Nothing
new there. The three presidential
candidates seem divisible only in
terms of sex, and levels of idiocy.
Did anyone read last week's
mundane selection of
manifestoes? Were there any real
differences between their policies?
"I promise to prevent the union
move to Sherfield. I promise a
referendum on the NUS affiliation.
I promise to be accessible to
students...". These were the words
of Miles Ambler. These were the
words of Kev Ward and yes, these
were the words of Sarah White!
Whatever happened to originality?
Most laughably, all of the
clone-didates promised to
"improve the commitment to the
Constituent College Unions",
which "provide a vibrant identity
for their members, a vital part of
IC life". Surely it is time that a
sabbatical candidate was actually
prepared to stand up and tell the
truth? That the CCUs are an
outdated anachronism, a feeble
excuse for a few people to knock
up some CV points while swigging
gallons of ale at the expense of the
Union. That they provide a vibrant
identity for only that small, selfish
minority who need a silly scarf to
bolster their lack of personality?
Where, I ask, is the vital part of IC
life supplied by the CCUs? Well,
let's look at the evidence. CCUs
have their own societies; but surely
these could be run directly through
the College Union, thus saving on
bureaucracy and money. The
CCUs provide the College with
their own magazines. Magazines?
Surely a magazine would actually
contain information, rather than
dross. It is not for no reason that
Broadsheet is commonly known as
Broadshite. The CCUs apparently
organise important events: such as
the Annual Engineers' Ball, which
bombed out last year and lost the
Union thousands of pounds. The
CCUs apparently provide for the
welfare of the students. Surely the
Union itself provides sufficient
welfare facilities.
Most of all, people will claim,
the CCUs provide camaraderie
between the appropriate parts of
College, provide a social arena,
etc. Really? How many people
actually get involved in the CCU
activities? How many students
would dare to admit to chanting
the Boumalaka, for instance? In
my first year I, with all other Guilds
members, was subjected to this
ritual. The response then, as now,
from the majority was "SAD!!". The
regalia, the mascotry, the rivalry,
all are totally outdated - students
nowadays have far more important
things on their minds. If any body
provides what the CCUs claim, it
is the Overseas Societies
Committee. It boasts a huge
membership, organises many
popular events (such as the very
successful International Nights)
and provides an important forum
for those with similar interests and
cultural heritage.
Admittedly, once upon a time,
when IC was populated solely by
young men with too much money
and no sense at all, the CCU
activities may have been popular,
and the 'legendary' rivalry may
have been more than a pathetic
fantasy. Now, however, the CCU
activities are enjoyed only by their
own committee members, who do
it purely to satisfy their selfish
interests and get pissed. They are
ignored or positively derided by
the rest of the Student Body. In the
recent Guilds hustings, for
instance, only candidates and
committee members were present.
And how many students voted? I
dread to ask.
So why doesn't a presidential
candidate offer to put them out of
their misery? It seems likely that
anyone who actually dared to
promise the abolition of CCUs in
their manifesto would be assured a
landslide victory. After all, the only
people likely to vote against such a
move are the constituent College
Union Committee members
themselves.
