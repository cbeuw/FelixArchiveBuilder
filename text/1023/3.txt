Japanese Boycott International Night
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
The Japanese Society is to
boycott tonight's International
Night.
In a letter to Andreas
M e r s h i n , Chairman of the
Overseas Students Committee,
the Japanese Society's executive
criticise his handling of the
event. They complain that they
did not get early enough notice
before each of the meetings, and
say that they d i d not receive

The End is Nigh
If you are thoroughly sick of the
elections then I apologise for this
issue. Believe me, as editor I
think I'm OD'ing. The claims,
boasts, brags, attacks, posters,
flans: it's all too much. But please
remember that when this started,
nine sensible individuals (and
New Election) set forth and, I
believe, made a genuine pledge to
try to improve things.
That four of them turned up
within half an hour at your room
in hall last night was annoying I
agree; that they promised
everything you asked but then
failed to return this morning with
either money, beer or an absence
of clothing is, yes, regrettable;
that the massive increase i n hot
air subsequently set off the fire
alarms and forced you to stand
outside i n the cold street and
gawp at the spod from the kitchen
who appeared to be partnered
with a lithe/strapping girl/boy in
a bathrobe/bin-liner was more
entertaining, true; B U T
ultimately they were all human
once and I think deserve our
attention.
Spend a moment to study
what they've said, written and
drunk in the last two weeks and
then go and vote. It'll only take
two minutes and, who knows,
your vote may make a positive
change. Perhaps they'll even
abolish elections next year! But
we should all vote in this one.
Easter Issue

plans for the event u n t i l two
weeks ago.
In response, M r M e r s h i n
suggested that the committee
were out of touch with their
members, and he blamed their
own incompetence and apathy
for their withdrawal. The letter
of complaint, dated February
23rd, was only received by
M e r s h i n last Monday, having
been sent to the wrong person.
W h e n questioned by
F E L I X , Andreas said that he
be an issue as usual next week,
and then we are skipping a Friday
to give us time to prepare a
bumper issue for the last
Wednesday of term. The deadline
for submissions is as usual, next
Friday. So if you have any articles
you would like to submit before
the end of term, then please come
and speak to me as soon as
possible. And if you didn't realise
that the end of term was so near -
trust me, it gets worse with age.
Phoenix
Papers are currently up, opposite
the U n i o n office, for anyone
interested i n editing Imperial
College's arts magazine Phoenix.
As one of last years co-editors, I
can vouch for the endeavour
being great fun and, in addition,
it's a lot easier justifying 'weird
arty stuff in an arts magazine!
The hardest thing of course
is getting contributors, but they
do appear from amongst the
woodwork. People seem to treat
the magazine surprisingly
seriously and in fact nearly fifty
people came into the office to get
a copy before they ran out the day
we distributed last year.
Conference
Amongst the usual sporadic stop-
start activity i n F E L I X
T O W E R S during the last few
weeks, there has been a sub-
section of quiet determination.
Totally separately from us (except
in as much as they all write for
F E L I X , use our photocopier,
phone, fax, envelopes, pens and
my patience) three individuals
have, with steadfast calm,
organised what I think could be
one of the best events of this
academic year.
anticipates that the event will be
a huge success. Defending his
organisational skills, he said:
"Nobody else has had any
problems, nobody else has
complained, everybody else is
happy."
W h i l e dealing with the
continuing financial complexities
of organising the event, D a n
Look, Deputy President (Finance
& Services) commented: "There
have been some small problems
but I still think it's going to be a

The Philosophy and Ethics of
science.
Interesting huh? Yes! As we
have discussed i n various
F E L I C E S this year (parti-
cularly co-organiser Samin's
'Political Science' column) fund-
amental questions remain u n -
answered of science and tech-
nology. In particular - should
technology be used with out
regard of moral issues? Many of
us study - and indeed lecture and
research - at Imperial oblivious to
the applications of our field in the
real world. (Except perhaps in the
case of the large number still
funded by military concerns!)
On a similar note, the
conference considers Science as
Religion. This isn't as wacky as it
sounds; it is simply asking how
science has come to hold such a
position i n our society that its
views are taken as 'gospel'. The
average Western man looks to
science for answers and although
some recent trends, such as
environmental awareness and
even the bleak cyberpunk fiction
might indicate this faith is
cracking, the fact remains that
science has easily the broadest
church in the First World.
If you disagree with this, or
even if you don't understand it
(and I vacillate myself), then why
not go along and make life
difficult for those who w i l l be
going to agree with each other?
The conference takes place on
Saturday, 18th March and has at
its core a series of discussion
groups, where these issues will be
tackled on a intimate level.

brilliant night." He admitted that
they would need to sell almost all
the tickets before the event would
break even, but felt that this
would not be a problem after the
huge success of last year's
cultural spectacular.
Tickets are available from
the J C R during lunch, or from
the Union office throughout the
day. Tickets to students cost £5
for the food fair, and £8.50 for
both the food fair and cultural
show.
Raanan G i l l o n from Imperial
College, John Taylor from King's
College, M a r y Hesse from
Cambridge, and Arthur Peacocke
from Oxford, a diverse and
eminent cast of luminaries, will
all be speaking on the day and
you'd be a darned fool to miss it.
T i c k e t supplies are very
limited, to keep the numbers in
the discussion groups quite small,
and so you are advised to contact
the organisers without delay.
Either come to the F E L I X office
to purchase your tickets, or else
email dyc@doc.ic.ac.uk for
further details. The future of your
planet is counting on you! (10
Hype; 20 Goto 10). Seriously, it
looks good.
