IC Funding Falls
B Y A N D R E W D O R M A N
T h i s year's increase of 0.7%
(before inflation) i n Imperial
College's government research
funding is only one third the
national average. The allocation,
which will mean a drop in real
terms, has been blamed on
changes i n the complicated
distribution system used by the
funding council.
D r Rodney Eastwood,
Deputy M a n a g i n g D i r e c t o r ,
speaking to F E L I X attempted to
allay fears that this decrease
would affect the research
activities of the college. D r
Eastwood said that Imperial
would "find ways to make up the
difference", but as the funding
figures had only been announced
the day before, he declined to say
how this would be achieved.
D r Eastwood explained that
the pool of funds had been
"adjusted between research
areas", and that in this instance
"it had worked to our
disadvantage", but that generally
"we do share common interests".
T h e Deputy M a n a g i n g
Director stressed though that the
impending H E F C E grading
exercise was much more
important for the future of the
college's research funding. The
process w h i c h w i l l rate all
departments on a seven point
scale has been described as
'fundamental', as this will decide
each area's future funding.
With H E F C E quoting a 40%
increase before inflation over the
last four years in IC's research
funding, this drop still leaves the
college with one of the highest
amounts of money i n the
country. D r Eastwood assured
students not to get too worried,
saying that the college's mission
is not going to change. "We're
not going to become a
polytechnic," he insisted, later
adding "and we're not going to
go broke or anything".
Guilds Decline
B Y A N D R E W T S E N G
South Kensington Constituent
College Unions (CCU) appear to
be i n decline following the
announcement of City & Guilds
College Union (C&GCU) election
results. Students in the engin-
eering and management depart-
ments voted for next years
elective committee last Monday
and Tuesday.
Bar new election, all posts
had only one candidate standing
and in a marked decline from last
year, figures were back to '93
levels. 190 votes in all were cast,
compared to 424 last year, from a
membership of over 3000.
When asked give reasons for
the low turnout, Tammy Atkins,
C & G C U H o n o r a r y Secretary
cited the lack of contested posts
along with "less and late
publicity". She added that there
had also been less interest this
year in CCUs in general.
Some controversy surrounds
the election of Sarah Thomas, for
the post of President and this
years publicity officer. M s
Thomas is also standing
unopposed for the Captaincy of
the Hockey club and some Guilds
insiders are concerned at the
workload two jobs would entail.
T h i s has been highlighted by
conflicts w i t h i n the current
Guild's executive, which have
been compounded by both Vice-
President, Richard Oussedik and
Honorary Junior Treasurer,
Gareth Parry, resigning over
workload problems.
Those elected were: (for
President) Sarah Thomas, (for
Vice-President) Duncan Tindall,
(for Honorary Secretary) New
Election, (for Honorary Junior
Treasurer) Simon Cope, (for City
& Guilds College Association
Representative) Steve Starkey
and (for Guildsheet Editor) Jon
Jansen.
F o l l o w i n g the failure of
James Tuff to be elected
Honorary Secretary, three posts
have yet to be elected. Elections
for the posts of Entertainments
Officer, Publicity Officer and
Honorary Secretary, look likely
to be delayed until next term.
Mary's Admission
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
In a study published this week in
the B r i t i s h M e d i c a l Journal,
Professor Peter Richards, Dean of
St Mary's Hospital M e d i c a l
School, has uncovered evidence
of ethnic d i s c r i m i n a t i o n i n
medical schools' admissions
proceedure. The report calls for
widespread changes i n the
undergraduate admissions
system.
The research team from St
Mary's, also i n c l u d i n g Chris
M c M a n u s , professor of
psychology, looked at the ethnic
origin of those who applied to
five different medical schools in
1990, and compared the results to
a similar study i n 1986. The
report concludes that people from
ethnic minorities are less likely to
be accepted. T h i s is partly
because they were less well
qualified and tended to apply
later, but even after taking these
differences into account,
applicants were 46% less likely to
succeed. T h e d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
seems to occur directly from the
application forms: the study
showed that ethnic origin was
p r i n c i p a l l y assessed from the
candidates surnames.
As a response to their
findings, Richards and McManus
have called for a system of
anonymous application forms to
be introduced. In addition, they
call in to question the fairness of
applications that are based on
predicted A-level grades,
suggesting that instead cand-
idates sould apply after their
exams.
Election Forecast
BY O W A I N B E N N A L L A C K
After nearly two weeks of
campaigning and four weeks of
hype, the Imperial College Union
(ICU) elections appear to be in
the balance. A poll conducted by
F E L I X on Tuesday and Wed-
nesday i n the J C R reveals a
hesitant electorate who have yet
to make their minds up. Four
positions are due to be elected on
Monday and Tuesday next week;
President, Deputy President
(Finance and Services), Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies)
and F E L I X Editor and Print
Unit Manager.
One hundred and three
people were polled i n a l l .
Interestingly, the results suggest
that there may be a relatively
high turnout at next week's
elections. More than half of those
randomly selected said that they
were planning to vote. Whether
that number will actually make it
to the ballot box remains to be
seen. Those who said that they
weren't intending to vote were
given a choice as to why they
weren't voting. The most popular
answer by far was that the pollee
was 'Not bothered who wins or
loses'. Voters also cited dis-
interest in the Union as a factor.
Of those who were voting,
only rough trends can be
discerned from the results as
appoximately half the pollees
plumped for 'undecided' for each
post. W h e n asked what i n -
fluenced their voting decision,
'Election Publicity (Posters and
Flyers)' was cited as being the
most important factor i n their
choice. As to the results: Rachel
Walters appears to have beaten
off New Election in the contest
for F E L I X Editor & Print Unit
Manager.
For Deputy President (F&S),
Annie Mathewman is favoured
over Matt Crompton, again dis-
regarding the large number of
undecided voters. From our poll
it appears that Luke Gietzen and
T i m T o w n e n d are fighting
virtually neck and neck over
Deputy President (C&S) with
Maryam Yahyavi trailing well
behind. Finally, the Presidential
Position appears closest of all. No
candidate appears well placed,
with Miles Ambler and Sarah
White having a slight advantage
of K e v i n W a r d and New
Election. Once again, it should be
stressed that most people have
not yet decided who to vote for
and that the campaign is far from
over.
