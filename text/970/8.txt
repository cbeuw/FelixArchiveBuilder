Loud and Proud in the Park
Nothing to do next Saturday? Why not join the antics of the Pride 1993?
Rach n' Jane preview London's premier summer festival
One of this summer's largest, free
festivals hits London's Brockwell
Park this month, featuring a wealth
of famous faces, top performers,
singers, comedians and chart-
topping bands. Dawn Fench will be
there, along with Jimmy
Somerville, Boy George, Hazell
Dean and many more. What is it?
Pride '93, that's what and if you
want to know more about being
'loud and proud and in park', read
on.
The festivities for the day are
designed to provide something for
everyone. Twenty seven marquees
are to be erected including eight
beer tents and a champagne and
cocktail lounge, plus a fair with all
the usual fairground rides. Lilly
Savage rules the roost in the Bang
Disco Marquee 4.30 to 7.30pm and
loadsa famous soapstars will be
signing audiographs in the Health
Education Authorities Health Tent
which will also feature 'Hunk
Aerobics'. Big name pop bands,
techno groups and soul singers are
promised for the main stage, but
they're not telling who until the day.
So if you don't go, you won't
know. Cabaret and Disco marquees
abound too, along with a market
area selling eveiything and anything
you'd expect (or not) to find at a
festival market. The whole day will
be wrapped up with an enormous
firework display.
So what exacdy is Pride? Maybe
it would help if I gave the festival
its full title, Lesbian and Gay Pride.
Yep, this whole day of free fun,
frolics, and music is actually
organised and run by a bunch of
queers. This doesn't mean that
straight people can't turn up and
enjoy themselves. On the contrary
and what better way to end a term
of exams than a free party when the
grant has run out. But, to get back
to my point, why would a group of
people want to put time, effort and
money into organising a massive,
free summer party? The whole idea
is to promote a positive image of
homosexuals as otherwise, normal
ordinary everyday people. It is a
chance for Gays and Lesbians to
stand tall and be proud of their
sexuality. After all, how are we to
expect others to accept us and
mm
respect us for what we are if we
live, ourselves, in shame.
A parade, from Victoria
Embankment to Hyde Park, with
fifteen floats following the
procession, is expected to raise the
profile of Pride, but the idea of a
campaigning theme for the day has
been rejected. If the day has any
message at all it is look, we're here,
and we're not going to go away.
The Stonewall group, a gay and
lesbian rights organisation, intends
to simultaneously release ballons,
one for every person jailed for the
'crime' of consenting sex with a
person of the same sex. This is to
be the only real political event of the
day.
Pride is not here to promote
homosexuality, or ram it down
people's throats, it is meant as an
annual bid for acceptance. I am sure
99% of the festival goers won't care
about the motives, they'll just be out
with the rest of us, 'loud and proud
in the Park', and enjoying every
minute of it. Put your prejudices
aside and join us there, I'm sure
you'll be pleasantly surprised.
