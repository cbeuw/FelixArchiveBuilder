Huffed Chau, a PhD student at the
Department of Computing, has
died of injuries from a recent car
accident.
Hilfred was travelling to
Plymouth for the Whitsun Bank
Holiday on 30th May when his car
collided with another. It took
rescue services half an hour to get
him free of the wreckage. He was
air-lifted to local Bath Hospital,
suffering from broken arms,
broken legs, severe chest injuries
and collapsed lungs. His condition
deteriorated late on Saturday, and
he died a week later on Sunday
6th June at 2am.
Mr Chau was at Imperial
College for six years, as an
undergraduate, a MSc student and
finally a PhD student. Described
as 'friendly and outgoing', a close
friend said, 'I never heard him say
anything nasty about anyone,
including lecturers'. Professor
Tom Maibaum, Head of the
Department of Computing, said
Obituary
'he was a very energetic and
enthusiastic person' who 'will be
strongly missed by all that knew
him.'
Hilfred recently had a paper
accepted for the forthcoming 4th
International Conference on Logic
Programming and Automated
Reasoning (LPAR '93), and was
due to present it himself.
Silwood thefts
Medical doubts

Plans to form an Imperial medical
'superschool' are facing collapse
this morning, with Health
Department officials accused of
orchestrating a split between two
London colleges. Officials at the
Hammersmith Hospital claim that
they are being 'played off against
the Royal Brompton while the
Department makes its decision on
West London heart services.
Medical institutes at both
hospitals were due to merge with
Imperial within the next five years.
The Royal Postgraduate Medical
School and the National Heart and
Lung Institute were to join the
Charing Cross Westminster Chelsea
Medical School and St Mary's to
form a new powerful Imperial
College School of Medicine. The
Hammersmith and Brompton are
now engaged in a bitter struggle to
become the sole provider of West
London cardiac care, with the
Brompton expected to win outright,
allowing the Royal Marsden
Hospital to develop its cancer
services. Celia Oakley, professor of
clinical cardiology at the RPMS,
says they will close i f the
Hammersmith loses its cardiac unit.

Police are investigating a major
theft from Silwood Park.
Computers worth over Â£50,000
were stolen from two buildings
early last Tuesday morning. This is
the third major computer theft from
Silwood in fourteen months.
Thames Valley Police say that the
windows of eight 'selected' offices
were forced open in 'the wee small
hours' of Tuesday. It is thought that
the computer equipment in these
offices could be clearly seen from
outside the buildings.
In one building, the thieves broke
open the office doors from the
inside, as the computers were too
cumbersome to remove through the
windows. The stolen equipment
was then stacked in the corridors,
while the thieves removed one of
the outer doors from its frame.
They then walked out of the
building with the computers. Their
escape was made in a Silwood
minibus, also stolen.
The bus was found yesterday
(Thursday) morning in Barnham,
close to the recendy burgled firm
known as Oceanographic Sciences.
Computer equipment was also
stolen from this firm in a recent
similar theft. Police say that both
thefts were 'specialist' break-ins.
College security say that all the
stolen items were marked, and
logged in a security inventory. The
computer data was also backed-up.
New security procedures have
already been planned for Silwood,
and will start on schedule next
week. No comment has been made
on reports from students at Silwood
that no security guards were on duty
at the park last Monday. The theft
is concentrating attention on
residual crime at Imperial. It is
expected that all students will be
required to wear their electronic
security 'swipecard' at all times
from next year.
