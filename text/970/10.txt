What is this mysterious Union
restructuring? Why is it happening
and more importantly why is every
one getting so anxious about it?
Armed with nothing more than a
tape recorder and the meagre brain
god gave me, I took a full frontal
assault on the slopes of annihilation
management. Here I found a fairy
tale a story that began a long, long
time ago, in a land not very far
away.
Once upon a time there was a
students' union. It was full of
people, but unfortunately, the
people that ran the students' union
were not happy, for they believed
that they were isolated from the vast
majority of the students. The
President, whose name was Chris,
said 'I will go out to the students
and there will be focus groups. And
thus we will know what every
student thinks and this will bring the
students' union to the students'.
And there were focus groups, and
they said that the students' union
was bad; the focus groups said the
union had no identity, no one knew
how to use it, and those that did
were known as 'hacks'.
Once again, Chris, for he was the
President, said, 'Let there be a
working party. This working party
will decide what to do'. And in the
month of April there was a working
party, and there was a solution.
Chris said, T believe this solution
to be good', and he spoke to the
union council and with a forceful
voice said 'We must restructure'.
Thus, the council was not happy
with this, and there was much
muttering and gnashing of teeth.
Of course, that is where the fairy
tale ends. Because now I have to tell
you how it really is. Imperial
College Students' Union is a fearful
beast made up of many committees
and mysterious rules and
regulations. The idea of the
restructuring is to simplify this and
thus make it easier for students to
use the students' union. Sounds
good so far but, the new structure
is printed on the page opposite, and
looks like the family tree of a
particularly fertile tomcat.
To see the difference you have to
compare this to the present
structure. A Union General
Meeting (UGM) at which all
students have a right to vote, has the
right to control everything the
students' union does. The day to
day running of the adrninistration of
the union is run by Sabbaticals
(students elected to do a job for a
year) and members of permanent
staff, who put into action U G M
policy. For general representation
the more senior officers of the
Union gather once a month to form
a body called Council. Underneath
this meeting is the general
membership of the union.
So why change? At present,
council contains fifty five members.
This makes discussion difficult and
often circular; it is seen as a
cumbersome body, but does gather
the vast majority of the union
together. As it meets once a month,
it is slow to respond and can be
perceived as intimidating to
outsiders. The other problem is
communications: The mass of
students are blissfully unaware of
what the students' union does. Chris
Davidson, the Union President
believes that a clear power
structure, explaining who does
what, will allow the student body
to make better use of the union. Last
November, Chris initiated a process
to reform the present organisation;
the fruit of his labours is the
opposite.
OK then, what does this huge
lump of lines actually mean?
Firstly, every one is responsible to
a U G M , as this is a legal
requirement. But now the week to
week mnning of the union will be
performed by a new executive. To
put it formally, this feature on the
union restructuring will have the
executive powers of a U G M . Or,
in English, it is allowed to interpret
U G M says and act on that. The
Executive will be members who
each represent aspects of the union;
the details are fairly self-
explanatory, and on the diagram
opposite. The controversial nature
of this body is that it will combine
and replace the role of Sabbaticals
and Council, and will only be
answerable to a U G M .
The second way of increasing the
clarity of the structure is to give
'empowerment' to the positions on
the Executive. Empowerment is a
concept given to job descriptions so
that the people employed to do a
job, will feel they are doing the best
they can. It means that when you
write a job description you give
someone as much responsibility as
possible and allow someone to
develop the job they do in a way
they see fit. This means the job
description of the new Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies)
could look like: Responsible for all
the Clubs and Societies at Imperial.
What is strange is that the broad
principles of this plan have struck
a chord of agreement in the union.
Even the staunchest critics of the
union agree that council is far too
big and holds up debate. Steve
Newhouse, Social Clubs Committee
Chairman, who represents all the
clubs and societies in SCC, admits
that council needs to change. Rachel
Mountford, R A G Chair, holds that
reducing the size of council is a
good idea. Andy Kerr, Ents Chair,
also broadly agrees with the
necessity of altering the present
situation. But, this is where all
consensus ends.
The new structure is more
businesslike, streamlined and
efficient. Unfortunately, a students'
union is not just a business. Andy
Kerr expressed concern that in an
external organisation, members
have time to study the areas that
they were responsible for, and that
students should be studying while
at University, not filling all their
time with students' union activities.
This is a call that Chris Davidson
rejects, he aims for a 'customer
driven' organisation, where the
students' union gives what the
students want. M r Davidson
believes this leaves no room for the
cushioning that has built up around
student unions in the past twenty
years. Worrying about the effect of
voluntary membership on unions,
he has frequently stated his belief
that every penny given to student
organisations has to justified.
Even now some posts in the
Union are not fdled for next year
because of the amount of work
required. R A G has no chair,
Athletics Clubs Committee (ACC)
found it hard to find a chairman for
next year; surely these executive
posts are going to be almost
impossible to fill? Chris Davidson
admits that executive positions will
be testing, but he commented that
the majority of the executive should
be able to resolve any disputes in
their own areas without bringing the
matter to the executive. A 'grass
roots' method should reduce the
executive workload Chris
postulates.
Concern has also been expressed
about the amount of power the
executive would have. With only 15
people actually in charge of the
Union, the main forum for
informed debate removed, the
executive could get away with
murder. Naturally enough Chris
Davidson rejects this: 'Council
requested that we hold UGMs once
a month', giving them the chance

Restructure!
What is the mystery behind this Union
structurelark? Jonty Beavantries to
explain the issues opposite and
outlines some of the problems below.
Some areas have been shaded on this diagram. Each marked part
means an area of controversy, these areas could change before the
final decision on restructuring is taken at the Union General Meeting
on Friday 26th June.
CCU's
Constituent College Union are
to have only one vote on the new
executive. It has not been decided
how this will be arranged.
One option is to elect a C C U
rep separate from Mines, Royal
College of Science and City and
Guilds and this one person to
represent then all. Another is a
rotating post so each CCU would
take turns to sit on the executive
consulting with each of the other
Unions before attending the
executive meeting.
Both Kate Dalton, C & G U
President and Paul Thomas,
RCSU President have agreed in
principle that only one vote on
council is enough for the current
state of their Unions. Although
others involved in the Constituent
Unions may disagree response has
been muted so far.
to iron out any difficulties
remaining. Kate Dalton, City and
Guilds President, said that most
decisions are taken before they
reach council. As Council meets so
infrequently, sabbaticals have to
make decisions that they are not
totally empowered to. She regards
the new executive as a broader input
into the day to day management of
the union.
But has there been enough
consultation with the Union
members? Chris Davidson says that
those involved in the working party
gathered about 400 hours of
opinions on students' perceptions of
the union. He also claims that most
of the students in college have been
accounted for by talking to
representative groups and asking
their views. Kate Dalton is not so
sure. 'There could have been more
but we (the working party on the
Union structure) wanted to get it
finished in the time given'. There
is a target to get the restructuring
finished by the end of the year so
it would be in place for the new
sabbaticals. The critics argue that
this would be rushing the changes
through.
But how can we guarantee that it
will work? If the executives do not
do their job who is going to stop
them? Chris also has his answer to
this: Elections would have a much
higher profile, introducing real
competition to weed out the less
able, disciplinary proceeding would
be a lot harsher, and with UGMs
held every month, it would be easy
to dismiss a member of the
executive. Incidentally, any
sabbatical member of the executive
would be much harder to dismiss,
as finding a replacement would be
near impossible.
Will it work? That we will have
to wait and see, but anyone who is
interested, the voting on the final
draft of these changes takes place
on Friday 26th June. If you have an
interest or an opinion please bring
it along and voice it there. If you're
here next year and it doesn't work
it will be your fault for not putting
forward your views.
Media
The three college media, Felix,
IC Radio and STOIC demand
independence with out
responsibility. The Students
Union want to cover their own
backs if any media is sued for
liable. The media believe that
union responsibility means Union
control.
Although this is a very old
Ents/SCAB/RAG
Each of these clubs look set to
lose direct representation on the
new executive. Hence they are
bitterly trying to fight for a
position of power.
Chris Davidson is set against any
of them being on the Executive,

This is designed as a forum for
debate for all the academic
representatives. It is meant to
have no power but exist as a place

should carry to the executive.
argument and will continue in
years to come. A compromise has
been reached for the moment: the
student media in this diagram is
not directly responsible to the new
executive, but have to answer to
a UGM. Hopefully this will satisfy
both sides but you will have to
wait until next year to find out.
and so the fight goes on. Possible
options at the moment are: The

each one under the Deputy

unsure and the power and
significance of this body is still
being discussed.
