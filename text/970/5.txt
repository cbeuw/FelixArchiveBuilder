Unfocused
Dear Jonty,
I have been following the recent
articles in Felix concerning Union
structure changes. Despite
conflicting reports that. Council
have both agreed and disagreed on
Chris Davidson's proposals it
appears that students are going to
get a chance to decide the matter
once and for all on Friday 25th June
at the Union General Meeting. How
generous an offer to be able to
decide what we want from our
Union. Unfortunately, this would
appear to be the first voice the
majority of students have been
given.
How are we supposed to make an
informed decision if the only
information generally available is
that, often confusing, conflicting
and probably inaccurate, printed in
Felix.
Surely there should have been far
more consultation with the general
student populus, particularly those
less involved in the Union. Within
my group of friends (I do know a
fair number of students here even
though I am not a spoddy Union
hack) none of those I have asked
have even heard of these nine
months of focus groups let alone
taken part in them. Surely we are
the type of people who should have
been in these groups?
I can only hope that enough
people will turn up to the U G M on
Friday 25th June in the JCR to press
Chris into fully explaining his new
proposals and how they affect the
average student. On the other hand
maybe Chris is hoping everyone
would rather go down Southside
Bar on the last day of term so he
can avoid potentially embarrassing
questions.
If you don't stand up, how can
you be counted?
Yours sincerely,
Susan Purdom (ISE 1).
Uninformed
Dear Jonty,
I see that Union Structure
Working party has finally explained
to members of Imperial College
Union the changes that it has
proposed.
Well I assume that was the
purpose of 'Flip Chart Abuse'
(Felix 969) that was written, as I
understand it, by I C U President
Chris Davidson.
I found the article incoherent and
incredibly uninformative. I C U
Council has spent around six hours
discussing these changes, yet
nowhere in his article does he
attempt to explain the changes, why
the Union Structure Working party
has proposed them, and what effect
Felix 970
it will have on the students.
If he does not have the time or the
information or the ability to
communicate these ideas to the
people who elected him and
represent him, then could he not
find someone else in the Union
Structure Working party who has?
There is no point in changing for
the sake of change. If we are going
to re-structure, let's do so after
informing the membership of the
changes.

Unhappy
Dear Jonty,
I read with some amusement your
news story in Felix 969 entitled
'Council Farce'. Firstly-I would
like to correct the small error, that
in both cases where you have
referred to SCAB you should
actually have referred to Ents.
It is interesting to note that the
motion discussed in the article was
not the only case where the decision
passed was actually against the
wishes of the people who it
affected.
Earlier in the evening, I had made
the suggestion, that, in all decision,
the wishes of the affected parties
should be upheld over the wishes of
the rest of Council, and Council
agreed to this. However, this did
not happen in practice, as the
Dunkin Doughnuts may ease the
blow of accepting this dodgy job.'
Next morning I punch in the
number. (Farewell to the word
dial). A n EastEnder-made-good
voice answers. We rap. Apparently
the job has something to do with the
stock market. 'Yeah, that's right,
just like Capitol City'. Err, yeah,
and Wall street. Sure, you can be
Charlie Sheen if you like. Ahem,
anyway, you must be available
seven days a week, for twelve hours
a day.' DONG. I feel faint all of a
sudden. T know it sounds a lot, but
as the, err, position, only lasts for
one month you'll need those hours
to achieve any real earning
potential.' The smell of solvency
brings me around. What kind of
earning potential are we talking
about here? 'Oh,' he says, 'around
- big big number -1 guess.' Big big
number in one month! Let's meet!
The appointment is made,
tomorrow, twelve noon. This
causes me some concern, as I
explain to Janet, American
manageress of the Oxfam shop. I'm
talking to her in combat trousers,
enormous steel capped boots and a
'Suck the System' T-shirt. 'No
honey, I really think you need an
image change for the interview.'
But all my wardrobe (read:
Opinion
11 June 1993
CCU's were not happy with the
C C U Rep, the Clubs and Societies
were unhappy with the DP (Clubs
and Societies) and Rag and Ents
were unhappy with the Ents Rep.
It would appear that Chris is
trying to spread the illusion that the
majority of people are satisfied with
this report. I quote from his letter
to Council members: 'It seems
sensible to discuss the
Entertainments Rep/DP (Clubs and
Societies) after the UFC meeting on
the 8th, twenty minutes should bag
it as consensus has emerged over
the last few days.' Yet I know that
of the eight branches of the Union
this affects, at least half are in
disagreement with Chris's new
proposals.
I am concerned that these
proposals are based on poor
research and lack of communication
with relevant parties. Maybe the
Union does need a change, but a
poorly thought out change that does
not address or solve any of our
current problems can only be a
change for the worse.
To quote from Chris's article
'Flip Chart Abuse' (are you
ashamed to put your name to it?).
'We'll show that Chris Davidson
what we think of a customer
focused Union...' Well, Chris we'd
love one, but we don't see one in
your current proposals.

'Owain, trust me, I know what

looking at the boots. She grimaces
and heroically she sets to work.

Woman, where Julia Roberts tries

thought I looked pretty good,
standing in front of the mirror in a
slinky figure hugging green wrap,
but Janet insists I start trying on the
business suits. Eventually we
achieve the impossible. I've been
shoe-horned into a shirt and tie.
Janet stands back and admires her
handiwork. City executive look for

Paul sees me in the suit and I tell
him about the advert. 'Oh a city

'London's a big city Owain. Trust
me, you'll be selling Dutch imports

faith. I'm off to buy a briefcase.
Tomorrow, here I come.

A Slice of Life
Once upon a time, my hero was
Richard Branson. Was it the long
tussled hair, the crazy balloon trips
or the mercurial portrait he
presented to the world? No, it was
the truckloads of money.Shocked
dear reader? After all, those of you
who do more than stand cups of
coffee on my column will have read
last week of my lefty pinko
subversive leanings. (Try doing that
in a bus stop without getting
arrested). But alas, I wasn't always
so angelic. And what goes around
comes around, it goes up and then
it comes down and finally just when
you think you know where you are,
you are there, but standing on your
head.
As I want to stay in London this
summer I need loot, and lots of it.
The miserly world's response?
'Read my lips, no more money!'
Actually it was more a kind of
strangulated mirth. M y father was
like, 'yeah, more money, M O R E
MONEY!' before rolling around on
the floor like a sea otter cracking
oysters on it's belly. Honestly, I'll
do anything to make my father
laugh. I think he's decided that's
why I was born. In the maternity

ward: 'yeah, my son, M Y SON!'
then he rolls among the cradles like
a (younger and sprightlier) sea
otter. Then he checks the other
babies name tags. The start of an
era.
I asked Graham, Manor's flat
mate, for advice. Graham, I need
something that pays well, involves
little time and effort and allows me
to maintain the degenerate lifestyle
to which I've become accustomed.
He ponders. 'Well, you're already
a student...' Graham, this is serious
- can't you see the dollars in my
eyes? 'Hmmmm....' He hands me
a small advert torn from the
Guardian. 'Call them, say Graham
sent you.'
On the way home I study the
advert, reading between the lines.
Cunningly however they've left
those bits blank, so instead I decode
the facts presented. Basically it
reads 'Wanted, starving human
beings. Must be able to hold pen
and see straight. Must be flexible
and liberal with (ones own) human
rights. Must consider the Citizens
