Does she take sugar?
What is Imperial doing to help its disabled students, and what can it
do withoutcausing offence? Stef Smith investigates.
It was all done so very casually. She
hitched up her summer dress a few
inches and injected herself in the
thigh. How can this woman be
disabled? She copes with her life as
the rest of the populous, faces the
same hurdles as any other student.
She just has to inject herself with
insulin a couple of times a day and
watch what she eats. Diabetic? Yes.
Inconvenienced? Definitely.
Disabled? The word just doesn't fit.
She herself objected to the word,
'Yes I've got a medical condition,
but I'm not very happy about it
being called a disability. I don't like
the implications of that.' Her
objections were more than just
emotive. She also felt the word to
be inaccurate, '.. .the term disabled
implies that in some way, your
functionality is impaired, which
mine isn't.'
But why was she objecting to all
this in the first place? I certainly
wasn't calling her disabled, so who
was?
It was all sparked off by a
questionnaire circulated by the
recently appointed Disabilities
Officer, Loretto O'Callaghan. She
left the Accommodation Office, and
was appointed Disabilities Officer
in late January. In May, she
circulated a questionnaire
concerning the situation of people
with various disabilities in different
departments. This questionnaire
referred to people with hidden
disabilities and listed these as:
diabetes, epilepsy, haemophilia,
heart condition and cystic fibrosis.
It was this questionnaire, and the
attitude that it created in her
department to which my friend
objected.
I cleared my mind of all the
prejudices that came with Loretto
form the Accommodation Office
where she used to work and left to
talk to her about her job in general,
as well as clear up her apparently
strange definition of disability.
Her office is in room 163 of the
Sherfield Building; the corridor that
leads to the Bank; the corridor
containing the Conference Centre;
the corridor that ironically has a
small flight of stairs at its entrance
and no lift access. Obviously,
Imperial desperately needs a
Disabilities Officer.
Loretto's ideas for her job
seemed rather straightforward, 'At
the moment (the job consists of)
going round looking at the
buildings... seeing whether we can
get wheelchairs in, seeing whether
there's any equipment available.'
She continued to tell me her
findings; all the things that are
wrong with Imperial, all those little
things that can make life very
difficult and access impossible to a
wheelchair user. When it comes
down to the geography, stairs and
ramps of College, she certainly
knows her stuff.
Her interest did not end with
wheelchair users. Loretto has plans
of white stripes on dark stairways,

loops in lecture theatres for the hard
of hearing and provisions for those
with language and speech
difficulties. So, what budget did she
have for this rather large
undertaking? The answer was a
very surprising no. 'It would be
nice to have a budget, but it would
have to be a nicely rounded budget.'
At the cost of over Â£30,000 for a
disabled toilet, the budget would
have to be very round indeed to
refurbish College.
I was starting to warm to her. The
Disabilities Officer in her move
from the accommodation office was
now sitting on the other side of the
fence. She used to create masses of
red tape and obstacles for students
in an effort to keep the
accommodation office afloat. Now
she must cut through others'
bureaucracy to get anything done.
But what was her attitude toward
the disabled. 'People who are
disabled don't like being referred to
as being any different to people who
are... able-bodied.'
But are diabetics disabled?
'.. .some diabetics have no problem;
they manage, but if they didn't, or
O'Callaghan, Disabilities Officer.
something happened, and they were
doing some work in chemistry, they
could be a danger to themselves, or
someone else...'. We jousted, and
I tried to present different scenarios,
but Loretto kept ducking and
diving. She refused to budge and we
stayed on different sides of that
fence.
I thanked her for the interview,
snapped a picture and returned to
the Felix Office to get a viewpoint
on the side of diabetics.
Deidre Whitley, press officer for
the National Diabetic Association
shocked me with what we had to
say. I asked her bluntly on the
society's attitude toward the word
'disabled', and while she did not
like it she did not like the word, she
admitted that diabetics can register
as disabled. The word has to be
applicable to the class as a whole,
even if it does not fit individuals.
Then it slowly dawned on me.
We have a stubborn, but very useful
Disabilities Officer, and a girl that
is hurt by the implication of a word.
This just serves to highlight an even
bigger problem. Just why is
disability a stigma?
