Sex, squalor and God
Phillip Henry chatsamiably to the eccentrics of Speakers Corner.
Although it's only ten minutes or so
walk from the college, how many
of you have been to the world
famous Speakers' Corner? I must
admit that I didn't go until fairly
recently (the April LSD convention,
actually) and I'm a third year. The
loss is all mine, I have to say;
Speakers' Corner can be one of the
most entertaining places a boring
Sunday afternoon has to offer and
what's more, its all free!
The place has a surfeit of
religious speakers but these have,
broadly speaking, the same
message: we are all evil therefore
repent before it is too late.
However, there are others with
more varied and interesting
messages than this.
Martin Besseman, a 32 year old
'entrepreneur', is probably the most
entertaining of those on offer
mainly because, as he claims, ' M y
main priority is to entertain people
though some people find a message
in what I say'. You can't miss
Martin; he dresses like a used car
salesman, stands on a step ladder
talking about his sexual prowess
and appears to have attended the
Basil Fawlty School of Polite Punter
Rapport. For instance, his opening
gambit goes something like:
'Good afternoon Ladies and
Gentlemen. M y name is Martin
Besseman and I am the best looking
speaker in the park. It is interesting
to note that all these religious
nutcases have one thing in common:
they're all bloody ugly. Come
closer, Ladies and Gentlemen. M y
voice is not very good today so
everybody except the Germans take
a step forward. The nearer you are
to me the nearer you are to heaven.
I realise why a few of you blokes
are hesitant about bringing your
girlfriends closer; I represent a
threat because of my sexual charm.
Tonight when you make love to
them, you are going to be thinking
about her but she is going to be
thinking about me....'
And so on. But why does Martin
do it? He is quite frank and readily
admits: T enjoy the attention.
Everybody craves recognition and
by doing this I get mine. I've been
coming here since I was 16 when
I came with my girlfriend and tried
to convince the crowds that, having
kissed her, she would give birth in
an hours time; when I was 16 that's
how I thought it was done... At the
moment I'm going out with a
beautiful 16 year old who I met
here. She came up to me after one
of my speeches and said:'You were
fantastic'.'
When I met Martin I was
fortunate enough to catch him
before he starts speaking and so was
able to see how he catches his
crowd. 'It's quite easy; I just stand
up... Some people don't get a
crowd because their delivery is no
good. You've got to be interesting
and use the right psychology. There
is definitely a skill in doing it and
I think I've got it.'. Indeed he has;
first he starts by chatting up some
pretty antipodean girls with T know
you're Australian; you look like
Kylie' to which she replies:'Oh,
thanks.'. Then he introduces
himself in a loud voice to nobody
in particular and within a minute or
so he has an ever growing crowd
of at least thirty.
By insulting the punters Martin is
begging for hecklers and has a few
retorts up his sleeve for just such
an occasion. A young, sassy West
Indian woman had questioned his
ability and had asked when he had
last made love to a woman. After
telling us how he'd last made love
on a train, he went on:
'So you see: women are after
experiences just like in the film
Indecent Proposal. It's not your
type of film, lovey. The Elephant
Man would be more your type of
film...'
I was browsing through some of
the other debates and came across
an Arab and a skull-capped Jew
who were engaged in a fairly polite
if impassioned debate.
'You Jews have always been
persecuted. You're always being
kicked out of countries,' said the
Arab.
"This is true,' Said the Jew.
'Because we were always the
masters and rulers. Rulers of even
the Arabs.'
'I'm proud of being an Arab, a
Semite. Y o u Jews, you are
American, English, Italian. You are
no longer Semitic...'
'I'm as much an Arab as you,'
said the Jew. The argument wasn't
going anywhere so I thought I'd
come back later. The Jewish-Arabic
debate hadn't been solved in the last
twenty years, I didn't feel it was
going to be solved this afternoon.
Speakers Corner was set up in
1872 after a particularly unpopular
government decision had caused
riots in the area. Having recognised
the need for a place for free speech
the Government, in typical British
style, imposed some trivial by-laws
such as banning the giving of
information on racing or betting,
the distribution of leaflets and
singing. Some rules are more
logical; one cannot incite to riot or
swear but despite this a lot of
speakers swear profusely when the
prowling police are out of earshot.
However, at least half the speakers
are talking about religion and warn
constantly against such works of the
devil...
George, a sprightly but rather
deaf 83 year old was one such
religious speaker who'd been telling
the wicked to repent since he was
16 years old. He claimed that he'd
converted to his way of thinking
'quite a lot of people' including
Baptist preachers. A dog collared
vicar told me before he sped off on
his cycle, that in seven years he
hadn't converted anyone, so George
was doing rather well. George had
worked at a Sainsbury meat depot
for 40 years and added rather
mysteriously that he was involved
with anything to do with coleslaw.
'We're all here to please God,' he
said. 'It's not easy but I can tell you,
it's the best life. Not like those
homosexuals over there. A l l the
problems with the world is to do
with those sodomites and their

'A
mmm
ilk...'
"Those sodomites' turned out to
be some quite nice people who only
asked for tolerance, acceptance and
the same age of consent as for
heterosexuals. David, a 24 year old
teacher with a slight Mancunian
accent, explained that the hecklers
of the 'Gay and Lesbian' platform
were 'extraordinarily ignorant
individuals'. We had one guy from
a small village in Lancashire who
told us that he wasn't surprised that
gays weren't accepted; after all
they'd only been around for twenty
years or so and it took time for it
to be accepted! He genuinely
thought it all started with Tom
Robinson's Glad to be Gay' in the
seventies.'
Had he ever had any violent
homophobics? 'Most of our
hecklers are closet queers who hate
themselves for their own
homosexuality. A guy called Andy
had heckled us for six or seven
years and then 'came out' and
expected us to be his best friends
and couldn't understand why we
didn't want to know him.
'Once we had two soldiers
throwing cans at us and then
Charlie, over there,' he indicated a
middle aged woman, 'Charlie was
aware after half an hour on the train
that she'd been followed by one of
the soldiers. He came up and
apologised for the behaviour he'd
shown in front of his friend; he was
gay and was trying to fool his
mate.'
Some hecklers didn't suffer from
such regrets. 'One guy threatened
to impale us on a red hot spike.
Another came down with his two
year old daughter and his pit bull
and told us explicitly how he'd like
to kill us. People like that shouldn't
be allowed to become parents.
Imagine the trouble that child will
have if she finds, when she grows
up, she's a lesbian.'
Was he frightened at all before he
got up to speak? 'The first time is
always scary but I don't get nervous
anymore; I know that I don't have
to do it, I can walk out anytime. At
school I was occasionally bullied
and I knew I had to go back
everyday. Now T H A T ' S
frightening.'
At this point a Christian from an
adjacent platform shouted to the
crowd in a strong Edinburgh
accent:'It's filthy, foul sex, the
Devil's sex, Demons' love. It's
filthy. Don't stand there, kids, or
you'll get a filthy, unclean spirit
coming out of those poofters into
you and you'll start thinking about
it...'
I was then introduced to Jon, an
Italian 30 year old council tax
worker who'd been over here long
enough to lose his accent. Jon was
a joint founder of the platform ten
years ago. 'We wanted to do
something about the miseducation
which society feeds us. It's had
some success; we get parents who'd
come here on holiday two or three
years ago and who've then found
that their kids are gay and they just
need some advice.
'When I decided to tell my
parents I told my mum first. She
gave the typical Italian mother
response and threw all the pots and
pans on the floor then told me to
give her five minutes to calm down.
She said that I was still her son and
though she didn't understand why
I was gay she'd always love me.
My father didn't speak to me for a
year; he bought a statue of the
Virgin and prayed to it to make me
normal. It's this kind of thing we're
trying to educate people against.'
Opposite the Gay and Lesbian
stand there was another David who
was 'homeless but I've been
homeless before' and angry that the
Government could spend sixty
million pounds on the restoration of
Windsor Castle and not thirty
thousand on the Hostel he'd lived
in that had to close. 'The problem
of homelessness is going to get
worse and worse and worse.'.
David was voicing his complaints
against all the Government and a
percentage of the police who are
intolerant of the homeless. T was
down in Knightsbridge and these
coppers came up to me and one of
them starts kicking me in the back.
He said: 'How'd you like me to kick
you in the face?' so I punched him
in the knee and got taken to the
police station. Now I know the
Sergeant; he says:'Hello, David,
how you doing?' and I explained I'd
been kicked by one of his constables
so he gave him a real mouthful but
when I left the constable told me
'I'm gonna get you!' so I live up
here now.'
I returned to the Arab-Israeli
debate which had become funnier
to watch but more of a school
ground argument.
'You are nothing without the
Americans. Zero. Nothing. What
would you do without them?' asked
the Arab.
'Oh, we'll find some other idiot.
You Arabs haven't changed in
twenty years of me talking to you.
But then, neither have we,' replied
the Jew with a shrug. 'You talk like
a primitive Arab. What can I do?'
'Bastards! That's what you are!'
'You Arabs are lazy bastards!
You are useless people!'
'You Jews are a shitty race!'
I managed to talk to the Jew
afterwards. His name was Joseph
and he told me he'd been coming
here since he was 15 way back in
1964. I asked did he always talk
about the Arab-Israeli dichotomy.
T try to avoid it like Aids,' he
answered. I tried a few other
questions but I found the old adage
is true: Why do Jews always answer
questions with a question? Answer:
Why shouldn't Jews answer
questions with questions? Joseph
was hard to pin down but he did tell
me that 'attitudes are changing.
There are too many foreigners, too
many wavelengths. It's hard to tune
into one in particular.'
I asked a few tourists what they
thought of Speakers Corner; They
were all entertained and commented
that nothing like it existed abroad,
not in America, not in Canada, not
in Turkey, not anywhere else. One
Indian gentleman stressed that
although India is a democracy and
although such a place could exist
there, none does. A n American
called London 'the home of free
speech'. One can become
complacent quite easily because to
me visiting Speakers Corner was
just something to do on an
otherwise boring Sunday.
