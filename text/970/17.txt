Withering L o o k s
This an evening starring only two
actresses who are members of
N . I. B. H. L. S (pronounced- nibbles),
which is National Institute for
Bringing History to Life Society.
They take you through the lives of
the Bronte sisters (Charlotte and
Emily only, Anne was too
unimportant) and explain their
works.
Boring? You must be joking.
This is a total piss take of the work
of the Bronte's. Periodically, hints
and tips are given for GCSE
students which have to be seen to
appreciate fully and the actresses
regularly pull revolting faces,
especially when the phrase
'Withering Looks' is said.
I had two favourite parts of the
ninety minute show. The first was
when Emily Bronte, played by
Audrey (a member of N.I.B.H.L.S,
who was played by Maggie Fox),
described to her sister Charlotte
(played by Olivia, who was played
by Sue Ryding) the story of
Wuthering Heights in five minutes,
using eight inch high black and
Boo
'It's me, I'm Catheee, I've come home now.'
white cardboard cut outs and
hysterical sound effect provided by
the actresses. Sounds odd? Again,
see it appreciate it.
The second memorable point was
when the actresses acted a clip from
the 1939 M G M version of
Wuthering Heights, starring
Lawrence Olivier and David Niven.
No description, go and see it.
Finally, if you thought that a piss
take of the Bronte's could not go
without a snippet of the number one
song by Kate Bush, Wuthering
Heights, you were wrong. It's in
there. Go and see this play to find
out where.

The M a n In T h e W i n d o w
by J o n C o h e n .
Take four people with their own
problems and attitudes towards life.
Louis, who for 16 years, since a fire
left him disfigured, hasn't left his
house, hiding himself from all his
neighbours and observing the world
from his window, finds himself
having to go outside again.
His mother who has to face her
husband's death. Iris, an
unattractive nurse but with a great
personality and sense of humour to
help her.
Her father, trying to cope with
getting old and "falling to pieces"
as he describes himself.
Entangle those 4 lives, make
them evolve in the middle of
Warvely's population, add a bit of
magic and you get the basis of' "The
Man in the Window". I know this
may sound a pretty boring and
depressing story, but to my surprise
it wasn't. The book is at the same
time sad and funny, well written,
and does not fall into sickening
sentimentality (only a touch every
now and then, especially at the
end).
Of course, if what you want of a
book is sex and violence, then this
one is not for you. But otherwise,
it makes enjoyable reading.

Danny Boy
This is a black comedy about a
Northern Irish catholic who gets
visited by the Angel Gabriel and
told that he is the Son of God.
There are many things Jesus U
(Danny) has in common with
Jesus—the original version. He
is a woodwork teacher (almost
a carpenter), he's thirty, and—
most convincing—he's got a
beard. Oh yes, and his parents
names are Mary and Joseph.
Given my views on the subject
(I'm a Christian) I may have
found this deeply blasphemous,
ibut due to the fact that many
Christians have a sense of
humour about much of their
faith, I found it absolutely
hysterical. The Church of
England is described as
'Atheism with Hymns', and an
Orange Man (Protestant) says
'Anyone who's been
excommunicated can't be all
bad'.
The humour in the play
comes from the Christian angle;
general doctrine, miracles, dead
budgies and Catholic/Protestant
differences. There are sobering
interludes concerned with the
political aspects of Irish life.
Danny's mother wants him to
use his 'spiritual powers' to
fight the republican cause, but
he just wants 'peace, love and
understanding' along with his
first disciple, his best friend
Dermot, a pacifist Stalinist who
he raised from the dead.
The play reached its
inevitable conclusion in a way
that wasn't at all tacky and made
its point very well.
You really should go and see
this play, its absolutely brilliant.
Spend some of that money and
go and see it.
