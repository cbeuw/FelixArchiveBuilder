Info boom Fees up?
Students applying to study at
University this October are being
told they will have no course to go
to following changes to the funding
of University degrees.
According to a report in the
Independent, students who have
accepted places to study on Arts
courses are being told that the
course no longer exists. The move
follows a cut in the fees to Arts
based courses by approximately
£500 per student.
This funding cut means that
Institution are having to reduce
student numbers. If a student has
accepted a place on a course this
commits the University to provide
a place If the student achieves the
required ' A ' Level grades. A
loophole exists in this contract if a
whole course ceases, then
Universities no longer have to
provide the agreed place.
One possible result of this move
is a serious reduction in the number
of 'holding places' for students who
do not achieve required grades. The
Independent article claimed that
places on Arts courses this year
could be scarce.
New proposals could mean that
graduates will have to pay extra tax
on their post-University incomes.
The shortage of cash in the
University system has sent the
Goverment and Vice Chancellors
searching for new ways to fund
Higher Education in Britain. Over
the weekend it was revealed that the
London School of Economics was
considering a tuition charge on its
students.
Concern is growing over the future
of Gardens Halls as a student
residence.
Last year the Princes Gardens Hall
caused concern among surveyors
from the London borough of
Westminster. Fire safety in the
Hall, which can house up to fifty
students, was considered by local
government officials to be
inadequate, and in need of repair.
Delays have been made in
implementing the alterations, but
pressure is mounting to have the
improvements completed before the
start of the new term.
It is believed that to make the
changes the Hall would have to be
closed for some time. Holbein
House in Everlyn Gardens
underwent a similar change last
Both Government and Vice
Chancellors believe that an extra
tuition fee would represent a tax on
the middle class, something both
groups want to avoid. It is
suggested that the an extra tax
would avoid controversy move of
levying students. A similar scheme
exist in AustrahVwhere graduates
pay a 2 % more tax after they start
earning over £13,000.
year and stayed closed for six
months, before being opened to
students in the middle of the Spring
term this year.
If Garden Hall did close it is
unsure what role the residence
would play in the College
accommodation master plan upon
reopening. Re apps are students
who spend an extra year in Halls.
Dr Simon Walker, warden of
Weeks and Garden Halls said when
phoned by Felix: 'I believe the
Estates division think the Hall is
inappropriate for use as a Hall of
Residence', Dr Walker would not

on the future of Gardens is expected
before College closes for the

A revolution in information would
follow from the recent Higher
Education Charter, claimed Tim
Boswell the Higher Education
Minister.
The Higher Education Charter
was released last month and sets out
broad outline of what students can
expect when they come to
University. M r Boswell announced
that reports of the performance of
the Higher Education institution
would have to be published in
University prospectuses. M r
Boswell stated that the Charter set
out what the general public could
expect for higher education as well
as students.
The present document is a
consultation document and will be
discussed by all those concerned
with higher education. Results of
the consultation on this charter and
the further education charter will be
released in the near future.
The Higher Education Minister
was speaking at the Association of
University Lecturers and the
National Association of Further and
Higher Education Teachers
conference held at the Cafe Royal
on London .

DP Elected
by A n d r e w T s e n g
There has been an appalling turnout
in the election for the Deputy.
President (Clubs and Societies).
Charles Leary, the only person
standing for the election, staved off
New Election by 50 votes. The 82
votes secured by M r Leary total less
than 2% of those eligible to vote.
This has raised doubts as to whether
he has the mandate of the students
that he is to represent, Dominic
Wilkinson, Honorary Secretary and
Returning Officer for the election,
said 'I'm extremely disappointed
about the turnout, but I'm glad
Charlie won. I'm sure that he'll do
a very good job.'
The results were announced at
nine o'clock on the evening of
Tuesday 7th June in Da Vinci's Bar.
The Honorary Secretary (Events)
made a rather unusual speach,
which criticised the poor turn out
and leveled personal abuse at
another mcoming Sabbatical. David
Goddard was attacked for not
turning up to sit on a ballot box
during the voting as had been
previously arranged with M r
Wilkinson. M r Wilkinson critcised
Mr Goddard for be 'unable to find
the Union Building'. This allegation
was then leveled at Charles Leary
as he was not being present at the
announcement of the election result.
All sabbatical election results are
subject to ratification by a Union
General Meeting (UGM). If M r
Leary is ratified at the next U G M
he will become the first Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies).
The new post of Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) has been
introduced following reforms of
Imperial College Union (ICU)
proposed by Chris Davidson, ICU
President. These wide ranging
reforms are also expected to be
brought to the next U G M .
The next U G M will take place on
the last day of term, Friday 25th
June.
