The course of Students' Union restructuring never did run true
Dear Editor,
It was with much concern that I
read the article in Felix some weeks
ago regarding the Union re-
arrangement. My understanding of
Chris Davidson is that he is a hard
working and conscientious
President who has the students'
well-being at heart; however, I feel
that in this case his refreshingly
short involvement in I C U has led
him to a misguided conclusion.
I agree with him that the Union
Council is cumbersome and that
student contact with Union Officials
is sadly low, however, the Council
is large to ensure that the students'
rights are protected. I accept that
ICU is run in a very different
fashion from all other Student
Unions but I protest that this makes
it wrong.
ICU was founded in 1909 and
was originally called the Union
Club. It was there to provide
Recreational, Social, Athletic and
Welfare activities for the students
of the College. In the 60s and 70s
many Student Unions went through
a dramatic re-organisation taking on
the structure of their close
associates, the Trade Unions. They
moved their emphasis from Clubs,
Societies and Welfare towards
Political campaigning and a training
ground for Party Politics. They
destroyed the concept of the
Students Union run by students for
students and instead produced a top
heavy and over-powerful system of
permanent staff.
ICU wisely chose not to follow
this route and, in the process,
alienated itself from the NUS
(National Union of Students), an
organisation which we had helped
found but which became so riddled
with this elitist political cancer in
the 70s that ICU found it beneficial
to disaffiliate.
Due to disaffiliation ICU today is
very different from all other Student
Unions and has been, and still is,
intrinsically more successful. ICU
built a reputation as a no-nonsense
Union which only made its presence
known when Student Welfare or
Recreational matters were at stake.
As a result its negotiating power is
much stronger than almost all other
Student Unions both within College
and with outside organisations. For
the majority of the 1980s the
combined purchasing power of the
NUS were unable to secure
purchasing deals on beer ai
favourable as those of ICU!
So why was ICU's system
stronger? I believe it was due to the
highly representative nature of its
internal structure. To make a
committee that represents the
desires and needs of the student
body a Union has to ensure that
representation comes from those
areas that are key to student
activity; areas where students can
test their representatives from day
to day in their everyday activities
and see those representatives, if
only in passing, on a week to week
basis. Ideally these representatives
would have a series of helper
representatives with their ears
closer to the student body and
spread throughout the body. These
people should be keen and willing
to work with the representative as
a result of their proven record of
hard work and level headedness
whilst performing these lower
ranking jobs in previous years.
Further, it would seem sensible
for the level of representation to be
proportionate to the level of overall
student involvement in that area. IC
Union Council accommodates this
ideology in its structure.
The majority of student time is
spent in academic behaviour. The
Council has around 10
Departmental Represenatives
elected by the students from those
Departments; these representatives
having a series of helpers in each
year. This makes up around 25%
of Council. Further, there are 5
Academic Affairs Officers, making
up another 12% of Council, also
dedicated to this field.
Nearly all students are members
of a Union Club or Society run by
hard working, down-to-earth
students who converse regularly
with a Committee Chairman who
sits as a representative on Council.
There are around 170 Clubs and
Societies. Approximately 60% are
run directly by ICU, the others are
C C U administered, and as a result
they are represented by 6
Committee Chairman and 4 C C U
Presidents, a total of 10
representatives making up another
25% of Council.
Two other student activities are
represented—Entertainment and
Rag. However, these do not have
the same well-spread foundations of
the Departments and Clubs
Committees and hence only make
up around 5% of Council with 2
representatives.
There are seats for three old
student representatives f
o provide a
long term input and experienced
advice. However, it is fair to say
that benefit from this input to
Council is rarely gained as these
people attend very infrequently.
The remaining 25 % of Council is
made up of elected Officers
including the Sabbaticals, people
who do an immense amount of
work but who have little by way of
a foundation of helpers or
information gatherers. Hence, they
tend to live in ivory towers removed
from the student body. Also, they
are people who can quite often be
elected with little or no background
knowledge or proven track record.
Such elected Officials can turn out
to be excellent Officers, as it
appears has this year's President.
However, as often as not, they
become unmitigated disasters
whose mistakes are only uncovered
once they have left office! Often
their input can be invaluable and
refreshing and, therefore, it is
generally worth, carrying the elected
drongo in order to benefit from
those with real vitality.
The flaw in the current
President's new Executive Structure
is that he has destroyed the essential
balance. Those areas of student
activity with good support
mechanisms that generally produce
a level-headed everyday student has
been cut from 62% representation
to 30%, and the elected Elite in
their ivory towers have increased
from 25% to 60%.
Far from increasing student
contact with the Union, the
President's Plan will reduce it. Ask
yourselves, how many of you know
who the Welfare Officer is, the Post
Graduate Affairs Officer, the
Overseas Students' Representative,
the Academic Affairs Officer, or
even the Hon Sec? It is an important
question as, if the President's plan
is to be successful, these people will
be running your Union by courtesy
of the fact that between them they
will hold 50% of the votes.
Have any of you met an executive
member from a Union run the way
the President proposes? Most are
highly Poitical Hacks who are
elected without having been truly
tested; they are often glory hunters
or are merely looking for easy C V
points. They are easily overcome
with the power and are tolerated by
a student body that is accustomed
to this sad state of affairs and really
knows no other alternative. Well,
W E DO! Imperial College has had
it for years—a proper representative
structure! It is immensely important
that you defend your right to proper
representation or else your Union
is likely to slip into a domain for
hacks. I understand that I C U has
many faults; however, it is certainly
more representative than the many
I have had contact with in the NUS.
I have one other major warning:
NUS membeship would be a natural
progression from the President's
Plan. The annual membership
would be sufficient to obliterate the
entire budget of any of the major
Clubs and Society Committees.
Hence, no Athletic Clubs and no
Recreational Clubs. This might of
course solve our problem of mis-
representation if in the future there
are likely to be no clubs to
represent. It would then be fair to
say it was a Union for 'hacks' run
by 'hacks'!
At the end of the day I can only
say that, as an Ex-President, I
would have loved to have removed
Council. However, it was the main
way of keeping me in check! I had
the dubious pleasure of sitting on
over 25 meetings of the Committee
and, although cumbersome, I still
believe it to be an essential part of
preserving the down-to-earth level
headedness of IC Union.
Having only seen 7 meetings of
Council spanning approximately 9
months, does Chris Davidson really
believe he is qualified to judge its
effectiveness, let alone a suitable
replacement? I believe the President
has come to realise that the student
body will not stand for this
degradation of their representation
and is, hence, trying to force the
matter through in the Summer Term
when the students are hard at work
'swatting' for exams. This used to
be a College Administration tactic!
Why have we reached the stage
where the Union President has to
adopt such under-hand tactics?

SUMMARY INSTEAD...
• ICU is different from other student Unions, but this is not
necessarily bad.
• ICU was formed a long time ago, helped create the N U S , then opted
out of the N U S when it became too political
• ICU represents students better because it is not in the N U S and
because of the structure of Council.
• The present structure allows those in power to be questioned
thoroughly. The new structure could destroy this.
• Few people have heard of the posts of the new executive, why
should this change because they now have more power?
• Is Chris Davidson necessarily the best person to decide these
changes?
