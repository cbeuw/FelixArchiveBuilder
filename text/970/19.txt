T h e T a m i n g of the S h r e w
Toby Robertson's production of the
Taming of the Shrew is a delight to
watch.
This Shakespearean comedy is
performed in the idyllic setting of
the Regent's Park Open A i r
Theatre. The magnificent colours of
both stage and costumes together
with the superb acting render this
play truly alive and energetic. Cathy
Tyson (from the film Mona Lisa)
skillfully plays a scornful
Katherina, whilst Geordie Johnson
provides her match as Pertuchio.
This was my first visit to the
Open Air Theatre and in one word
I'd describe it as 'magical'. What
more can I say but you must go
even if this is your only trip to the
London Theatre.

'Of course, my love'
"Then why do you insist that we do our faces like Perriot clowns and wear these over-the-top costumes
before we make love?'

Theatre Gossip...
Puzzler: What was the name of the play that Madonna
starred in when it premiered on Broadway in 1988?
by Reviews Ed.
Felix was supposed to bring you a
review of Andrew Lloyd-Webber:
The Musical this week but the show
was cancelled at the last minute.
Apparently the organisers
postponed the show until further
notice, as Mr. Lloyd-Webber was
suing them for libel or deformation
of character.
The show, being presented at The
Birds Nest Theatre, (32 Deptford
Chruch St., SE8, New Cross Tube,
081 694 1600), is described by
Time Out as a 'short, satirical trip
through an alternative interpretation
of the career of Andrew Lloyd
Webber'.
All I can say is that it must be a
bloody good play for Mr. Lloyd-
Webber to sue them and he should
be able to take criticism, since he
has a virtual monopoly on the
theatre world at this present time.
I advise you to phone for tickets
as soon as possible. This sudden
development is guarenteed to make
it extremely popular.
