Long Shot for the
Pistol Club
Long range pistol consists of
shooting a fairly standard handgun
over fairly non-standard distances,
in this case over 100, 200 and 300
yards hitting fairly small targets
(e.g. 10 inches diameter at 200
yards). This is a fairly tough
proposition because to get a fairly
normal handgun to shoot over
extraordinarily long distances
requires distinctly non-standard
ammunition. This means D I Y
ammo. Normally it entails putting
as much powder as possible in the
case and then squashing the bullet
in with a vice. There is a plus and
minus to this technique. The plus is
that the bullet may just leave the
barrel quick enough to travel 300
yards before succumbing to
Newton's finest. The minus point
is that there is increased risk of a
small localised explosion resulting
in instant dismissal from the range
and equally quick admission to
hospital. This results in a trade-off
between potential accuracy and
perceived safety. Accuracy dictates
a steady grip, cool gaze, and
controlled breathing. Fears for
personal (no one gives a hoot about
the folks either side) safety result in
eyes being closed, hands over ears
and uncontrolled whimpering. It
gets worse when there are 30 odd
people doing it.
In pistol shooting few things are
certain (did I fire five, or was it
six?), and the team turning up is one
such phenomenon. Last year
ICR&PC fielded a ' B ' team as a
back-up in case all else failed. It
did. The ' A ' team, consisting of the
then current executive, failed to
enter the competition 'cos they were
crap. They failed to get the gun
refurbished, 'cos they were crap.
They failed to provide a new match
pistol because they spent the cash
on a fun-gun, undeniably fun, but
another crap idea. This year they
did exactly the same, except they
didn't buy a fun gun.
This year the ' B ' team faced
further handicaps due to the range
refurbishment—crap idea, not being
completed on time—crap project
management, not being up to
standard—crap planning, then being
arbitrarily closed—crap
explanation. A l l courtesy of 'the
management'—"students views
come first".
Fortunately Oxford think that
'ballistic coefficient' is preceded by
0898 so although IC's kit consisted
of a dirty revolver and a box of
rusty ammo, Oxford got a good
stuffing. Well, they would have got
a good stuffing. On seeing that IC's
score was almost 3 times Oxford's
1992 score they packed up and went
home.
The actual shooting saga went
something like: arrive on the 100
yard firing point at 9.00am; admire
clear blue sky and pristine target;
spray two five round strings down
range in 30 seconds per string;
admire clear blue sky and pristine
target. C J Hurr lead the IC team
with the authority of a blind man,
scraping a paltry 41/50, A C Jones
and E M T Young 40/50.
Out at 200 yards and Jones
showed how it was done, and was
keen to tell others how easy it was
too as he popped in a mightily
impressive 48/50. Hurr and Young
43/50.
Out at 300 yards and anything can
happen. Free beer, dancing girls,
you name it. But generally wind.
Good for windmills, wind-surfing,
Pierre parpy pants. But not good for
shooting. Jones though was scoring
bulls a-plenty until the realisation
that he was in danger of another
trophy and that there was simply no
room for it at Clayponds led to a
complete miss. Hurr and Young
suffered from wind. Scores for
Jones, Hurr and Young were 40,
36, 34 respectively.
So, despite everything, IC put up
their best performance ever,
aggregating 365/450. The final
individual scores were, A C Jones
128/150 (6th overall), C J Hurr
120/150, E M T Young 117/150.
Congrats to Jones for being an all-
round-mega-hero (and writing this),
and to Young for doing so well on
his first attempt. Hurr once again
facilitated the whole show by
providing all the kit and most of the
expertise.
