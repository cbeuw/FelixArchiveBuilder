HAIRY COCK ROCK..
Wake up, BoZos! This is the
nineties.
No. Leave them. Let them have
their wet dream

Records. It's that word again.
'Soon'. The ghost of Gareth

rears its flowery head once more.

E.P.
Likeable debut effort by latterday
punky rocky types; There are four
tracks on this E.P., 'I need you
now', 'Delicious', 'Breathless', and
the title track. The tracks are
nothing special, but there's a little
bit of fairy dust in there,
particularly with 'Delicious'. Not
unpleasant, just a tad
throwawayable.

You heard what the man said. 'Hairy Cock Rock.'
A T R
Is it just me or is everybody
becoming sentimental? What actual
changes did the 'hippy' movement
effect? None in my opinion, and the
current vogue will have the same
none-effect. I people seriously want
change then it will happen. The
society dictates what happens in
society. So when someone stands up
for their opinions you have to
admire them. Using a style of music
that tends to attract people with
racist or other undesirable character
traits takes guts,

- A s Y o u W a l k
This sounds remarkably out of time.
In many ways reminiscent of late
60's US garage. It even has those
authentic touches, like little doses
of feedback in the middle of the
track as they play with their amps.
I have a feeling that this will be
crucified by the music press, but I
like it and that's what you want
from me isn't it. Opinion,
peb
C o d e - 5 0 5 3 4 5 6 7 5 Delta 9
I'm not too sure about this. On the
A side is a rather dower track,
nothing too it. But on the other side
there are three tracks, two mixes of
the A side and an original one. They
are far more entertaining and could
be considered exercises in beats and
rhythm. A bit hard to describe
really, and I cannot recommend this
to anyone not already familiar with
this genre,

David B o w i e - B l a c k T i e ,
White N o i s e
The ol' phoenix from the ashes that
rudely broke the 'Hasn't made a
good record since...' thirteen year
protocol with 'Jump They Say'
reveals more of itself than perhaps
it should, ie, it's had its wings
clipped. Are we mixing our
metaphors here? maybe, but we
must ask if 'Black Tie' and 'White
Noise' is an adequate enough
juxtaposition of racial cultures in
order to make his point felt, that's
to say, fascism is a bad thing and
its perpetrators are naughty fellows
who relate more to uncivilised
animals than their targets,
conversely represented as the
survival of high culture. Bowie
Bjork - H u m a n Behaviour
She's back! With a voice that the
angels would kill for, Bjork has
come up with the strangest single
in ages. The music fuses dance with
her indie past, but it's her voice that
grabs you by the scruff of the neck
and turns you inside out. Essential.

As oily as only he can be, this
curmudgeonly old twat evidently
feels the time is right to put on his
teacher's hat once more. I turn to
my little friend, whom we shall call
'Gareth', and express the hope that
Sir is not going to read any of his
poetry. Oh. He is.
Me? I'm sitting at the back of the
class, doodling Sting caricatures in
hilarious situations, and writing
unpleasant messages to little girls,
'cos I've heard it all before. 'Please
sir, Donny's not listening. He's
drawing fun-sized willies, with your
face on them' Cheers, Gareth.

• Out now on A & M , though why
you'd wish to buy something by
such a donkey's cock is beyond me.
stints on sax on this funky-ish
number that isn't bad at all.
Congrats, M r B . It seems the
hunting season is over, and you're
smiling like you planned it this way
anyway.
