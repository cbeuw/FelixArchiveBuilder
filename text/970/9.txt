Ad your own imagination
In a vain attempt to understand the world of advertising, Rachel Bassett
scrutinises infamous Tampax ads and much, much more.
Just for fun, try a little end of term
quiz. Ready? No peeking, naughty.
Okay, here goes. What is, or are,
Tampax? I'll give you a choice of
three.
a) A brand of sanitary protection
b) A range of beachwear
c) A rather unreliable type of car.
To put you out of your misery,
the answer was in fact a). To those
of you who got it right, well done.
I can only presume that either you
made an inspired guess or you
weren't fooled by the recent T V
advertising campaign for said
product. After all, what images
were present in the commercial? If
my memory serves me correctly, it
showed a group of young women
in skimpyish beachwear pushing a
car along a beach with some jolly
background track about 'It's M y
Life'. What information did this
give us about the product? Did it
extol its good qualities? Its
advantages over the competition?
No. It dropped a couple of subtle
hints about a New Plastic
Applicator, and apart from that it
told me that cars can break down,
that young women on beaches can
push cars, and that my life was my
own, all of which I flatter myself
I knew already.
Some more perceptive readers
might say that Tampax have good
reason to be careful of the material
in their advertising campaigns,
when we consider that Always Ultra
had an advert banned last year for
being too graphic. Too graphic? It
had Claire Rayner in it, how much
more wholesome can you get? Even
if she did do slighdy alarming things
with blue ink. So alright Tampax,
you're off the hook, you can fudge
the issue as much as you like—but
what about the hundreds of other
adverts that serve only to foster a
product's image while telling you
nothing at all about it? I might point
in particular to Gillette (The best a
man can get—the best what a man
can get?), Bacardi and especially
the Guinness advert I saw last time
I was at the cinema—like, mind-
blowing, man. My roommate has
just informed me that the bloke in
the Guinness ad is meant to be a pint
of Guinness—that's why he's all
dressed in black with very blond

hair. How cunning. What's the
message on that then? Guinness-
it tastes like shit, but what a good
idea for a fancy dress party. Does
the campaign mention at any point
that the thing it is selling is an
alcoholic beverage? No, because
we're all meant to know what it is.
Their job is to change the way we
perceive it, and if they want us to
perceive it as a psychadelic journey
through a whale, who are we to
argue? It's their time and money.
Now we've got onto beverages,
I suppose it's time to mention the
main ottenders in the style wars.
Like Guinness, they're brown, but
these are soft, sugary drinks
beloved of teenagers throughout the
world (apparently). They're hot,
they're'cool, they're the real thing,
they're the taste for a new
generation, they bring you alive,
they're it, they give you that good
good feeling, or as any person with
an intact personality might put it,
they are Coke and Pepsi, two
mainly inoffensive non-alcoholic
fizzy drinks.

Let's think back to some of the
Coke/Pepsi ads of the past years.
There was the 'Taste of America'
campaign, in which some bloke let
a lorry fall down a cliff because the
cola in it wasn't Pepsi, and some
other person ate the entire menu of
a restaurant except the cola, because
it wasn't Pepsi. I sense a recurring
theme here. I could also swear that
at one point there was an advert
with a girl refusing to neck a bloke
in a car, but relenting when he puts
a Pepsi ringpull on her finger
(Maybe she thought it was a form
of contraception). Michael J Fox
climbed out of a window in the rain
to get someone he fancied a diet
Pepsi, which I think says more
about human lust than it does about
the drink, and recently we've had
Elton John at the piano singing
about it. On the Coke front,
there've been a lot of tanned
American teenagers getting up to
wild'n'wacky things, but never
once putting their bottles down,
people standing on mountain tops
holding hands, and beautiful
romantic songs (First time, first
love, oh what feeling is this?
Electricity flows with the very first
kiss).
I would be more impressed with
any one of the above if they said at
any point why the product is any
good, rather than leaving us to
understand that they must be,
because they said so. What's wrong
with hard facts, with positive
reasoning as to why we should buy
something—do they really think the
nation will rush out to buy Pepsi
because it's the 'taste of America'
(a meaningless statement if I ever
heard one)?
Let's stop the rot here, and start
a campaign for saner advertising.
No more half hints or glossy
images, let's have solid statements
and a dose of truth. It'll be a long
hard struggle—but when I hear the
slogan 'Pepsi—it's a drink, and it's
almost exactly the same as Coke,
except we think it's better, so why
not try some?', I'll know we're
almost there.
