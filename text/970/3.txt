Felix 970 11 June 1993
Leader
This, as you may know, is the
penultimate editorial for this year's
Felix; these were written with
constructive purposes in mind,
purposes that have been effectively
dashed this week by the
overwhelming lack of interest
shown by the student populace
towards the union, and the way
their lives are subsequently
affected, while at Imperial College.
While Felix is renowned as the
place to rant about the world
surrounding it, it shouldn't take
much imagination to guess what this
venting of spleen will be about.
Come on. 114 people. For crying
out loud, that's only 2% of the
voting population! That is the 114
people who bothered to vote,
whether they had gone out of their
way to exercise their rights, or were
just passing and decided they could
spare the three and a half seconds,
in the Election for Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies). It's funny,
but I understand there to be 115
clubs and societies under the
jurisdiction of the union.
How can you seriously expect
someone to be paid Â£10,000 of tax
payers' money on a vote that could
have had a different result if one
ballot paper had gone missing?
Charles Leary has to speak and
represent every student and every
extra-curricular interest at Imperial;
Congratulations, M r Leary. Your
mandate is 82 votes and 3900 kisses
to the wind.
It therefore seems that the student
body is at the very least having
problems understanding the
relationship between cause and
effect; at the worst, they are either
ignorant or victims of
disinformation.
I do not detract from Mr Leary's
ability. He seems confident, assured
and concerned about the job he has
been elected to do. But this is hardly
suprising; I would be concerned if
I went into a job that someone had
decided to create out of what may
be literally nothing while they were
filling up on lager.

More flipping abuse
Who is the masked man...who is
the eloquent wordsmith, tunesmith
and locksmith that graced this space
last week. Well it was I. Yes, self
confessed flip chart abuser davidson
stirring the pot again. Thankyou,
you responded, (see the letters
pages) that is what last week's
article was all about.
Jonty is, as I write, mulling over
his computer screen to produce for
you the definitive explanation,
contained elsewhere in this issue. I
hope he will be critical and point out
all the flaws people see in the plan,
I have every faith that he will. This
will give you the chance to digest
the plan and make an informed
decision, about whether to pass the
new constitution, when I present it
to you, at the U G M , on the last
Friday of term.
Why should J not explain it to
you? Simply because I have a self-
interest in seeing the plan come to
fruition. No, not because I want to
run the Union next year, I don't
have the energy left and have a third
year to do. I want to see the scheme
passed so that the Union can survive
the years ahead.
The constitution I will present
will be a legalistic, but hopefully
easy to understand implementation
of the plan. It will in short be the
arms and legs of that which Jonty
writes about. I hope you like it.
