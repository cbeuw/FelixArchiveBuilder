MAD
A startling
revelation rocked
the Felix office
yesterday when it
was discovered that
Declan Curry,
former news editor
of Felix, is going
insane.
The surpise came when M r .
Curry was on the telephone
chasing up a story when he
suddenly and unexpecedly made
a loud warbling type noise by
shaking his head to and fro.
All who were present stopped
what they were doing to wipe
their faces free of the saliva that
was ensuing from this action.
M r . Curry was quickly
dressed in a straightjacket with
matching manacles and given
life membership to Devil's
Island.
Bizarre satanic ritual takes place at Putney. It's just a coincidence
that the Boat Club is based there.

Cat's Eyes
Chris D a v i d s o n
London Docklands Regatta, held
over two days on the 5th and 6th
June, was the top multi-lane event
of the season and once again,
Imperial were the top club in
racing. Entries were not large but
the quality of the opposition crews
was very high, and races always
hard-fought.
On Saturday, a stiff tailwind took
the edge off the blazing heat and
produced some very fast and close
racing. The premier event of the
weekend, Open Eights, was entered
by IC's potential Henley Temple
Cup crew and they were faced with
the top crews from London R C ,
Thames Tradesmen and prospective
Henley opposition in Oxford Poly
and Reading University and IC held
on for a 0-3 second verdict and the
gold.
Meanwhile, IC women continued
their improvement with classy wins
in College coxed fours and Senior
3 eights, both victories by
substantial margins, one of them
produced a gold medal. Another
Henley crew from the men's top
squad beat a much-fancied
University of London BC four to
win Senior 1 coxless fours, and
complete and impressive first day
of racing.
On the Sunday conditions were
still and margins thus slightly
larger. The women stole the
limelight with a dramatic win in
Senior 1 eights, rowing down their
more experienced opponents at the
finish. Congratulations to Nick
Wilde the women's coach who has
pulled the crew together.
A crew re-shuffle in the Open
Eight left them with the silver to the
London boat and a quad from
Thames RCand IC snatched silver
also in Open Quad Sculls. The
Open Quads winners on both days
were shocked by an IC student, and
Open Mens Sculls was won by ex-
IC Leon Fletcher, to underline our
dominance. These results bode well
for Henley (Men's and Women's)
success and more immediately, the
top squad trip to Paris International
Regatta on 12/13th June.
A message from someone far away:
To Chris, having a lovely time.
Take good care and I'll see you very
Ballet
I have never been a lover of ballet
and cannot think why anyone would
want to pay to see a soir(accent on
lst)ee of scantly clad people
jumping around spasmodically to
classical music. But it seems that
those who do want to see such a
performance have to pay through
the roof.
If a theatre production was being
held at any West End theatre, the
price range would be from about
£10 to £30. Hold a ballet at the
same theatre, and the price range
soars from £10 to £60. Why?
Finale
As you were told by Jonty's
editorial last week, there will be
three special edition Felices coming
out on Wednesday 23rd; one will
be full of Features, one will be full
of Reviews and the other will be full
of News and current affairs.
Yours truly has his own space in
the News edition. It will contain
special thanks to everyone who has
got in my good books throughout
the year, and also mega fuckings to
anyone who has got in my bad
books.
Feeling H o t
Along with lazy days and low
heating bills, summer also brings
bad tidings. Hay fever, traffic jams,
blistering heat and T V summer
specials are to name but a few.
Would you want it to be summer all
year long? What would summer be
called then?
Lady Chatteriy's Lover
How disappointing. One feeble bid
at a sex scene in the entire 55
minute episode. Come back A Year
In Provence, all is forgiven.
H o n S e c
What a nicking joke (the election
for new one, not the current one).
I don't think that it can hardly be
described as an election.
But it's hardly the right time of
year to hold one, is it?
