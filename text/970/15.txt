Thousand Yard Stare: Messianic, or a trifle over-exposed?
Aztec Camera - Dreamland
No doubt, someone somewhere is
cheering the flowery return of
former child prodigy Roddy Frame,
he of such finely unsweaty moments
as 'High Land, Hard Rain', he for
whom great things were expected.
'Good Morning Britain' aside,
though, he hasn't made a good
record for eight years, or
thereabouts. If you disagree, that's
ok, your prerogative, we're not
style fascists, et cetera. Bet you're
feeling pretty stupid now, though.
Once past the 'Roddy Frame in
Rock n' Roll pose' cover, we
encounter the lyrics, and press
'play'. The tasteful execution of
drums, Ryuichi Sakamoto's
keyboardy string arrangements, and
the like, sort of rises up like a gende
wash type thing while Roddy wails
'How sweet to fly, to touch the
sky', and achieves, notjust the most
stupendous musical moment ever,
but. 'Safe in Sorrow' follows,
spinning us lines like 'Building up
a big brick wall' and 'you will see
my love is for free'; dearie me,
Roddy, M r Lyric's well and truly
absent, isn't he? And Colonel
Melody? Well, he seems to have
downed a kilo jar of honey for extra
sweetness, and a gallon of kaolin
for his diarrhoea. 'Black Lucia'
starts promisingly enough, with a
couple of chunks of roughneck
guitar, but these vanish into
saccharineland before you can say
'Hey, that's pretty good after the
last load of old bollocks'. 'Spanish
Horses' has quite a nice little guitar
line, reminiscent of John Williams
at his most flamboyant, but then
'Dreamland' is just a bit fucking
'nice' all round.
'Dream Sweet Dreams' is the
closing track on side one, and it's
probably the strongest song, in spite
of Knopfler-esque guitar work circa
'Making Movies'. The other side
takes the structure, takes out the
bones, and, frankly, takes the piss.
Jesus Christ, this is the sort of mind-
free wank you'd expect from Tina
Turner, and on the strength (sic) of
'Pianos and Clocks' and 'Sister
Ann' you'd probably say that
Roddy's out of the Frame (Oh, har,
har, bloody har - sic. Ed). The
consensus around here is that M r
Frame has in fact 'lost it'. I mean.
Lives have been ruined for less, and
Thousand Yard
Stare—Mappamundi
'Hands on', moving on, a murkier
second album from Thousand Yard
Stare not quite so precise, so exact
as the first; more variety; a deeper,
more active album, less...less,
more, more.
Admittedly the first time I
listened to it I was non-plussed, to
say the least. In fact, I think the
actual word was 'Bollocks!'. But all
things take time. 'It's the quiet ones,
that kill your friends'. Indeed,
'Mappamundi', creeps about, and
now, oh now, it gives me
goosebumps, jumps and lumps.
'There's been a small change, a
time to rearrange', differences, yes,
but still pretty much unique,
recognisable as Thousand Yard
Stare: See for miles.
Easi Style!

it really is time we took these
unbelievably wealthy charlatans,
put them against a wall and shot
them for disgraceful careerist
blandness. Remember John
Lennon. That's my little notelette
to Roddy Frame; Someone should
have told him you can only dream
for so long before you're dead.

Darlingheart - Serendipity
First and foremost, I'd like to get
something off my chest; a copy of
this review will go to NUS Ents,
and the managers of the Astoria,
where Darlingheart played a
support slot to Blur last friday
(You remember. It was previewed
in Felix last week - sic. Ed): You
fucked up. I don't know which of
you fucked up, but you fucked up
nonetheless, and, bureaucracy
aside, your door policy's shit and
so is the wanker who enforced it
on my reviewer. You may not
think it matters that much, but
our student handbook carries a
venue guide, and the competition
for the worst venue in London (an
accolade coveted previously by
the Hammersmith Odeon and
Wembley Arena) looks like being
a one- horse race, if you get my
meaning. C**ts.
This is Darlingheart's debut
album, and much as I'd like to
apologise for our incoherent
obscurantism, we have reviewed
them before, as have others.
They're from Kirkcaldy, a
channing little place not so far from
Edinburgh where I spent a little of
my youth. 'The Flood' opens the
album, a brief, skimpy thing that
opens up for 'Loaded' 'Smarthead'
et cetera. The heavily under-
exploited combination of guitar and
cello is one Darlingheart have
employed to a highly proficient
degree; it sounds frequently like the
Muses gone even folkier, but
overall it is a darkness charming its
way into your head. The sleeve
notes, by the way, credit one
Callum Gilhoully, of 'Absolutely'
fame (or should that be infamy? -
sic. Ed), for harmonica and (get
this) 'anorakium'. There's quotes
from the poet, Stevie Smith, and
'well-known Geordie sports
commentator', Syd Waddell, too.
As if that wasn't enough (Actually,
I could tell you that there's two girls
in the band, and they're both babes,
but I (Shut up, O'Nonchalant; This
review's crap - sic. Ed) wouldn't
stoop so low). Fair enough, boss.
