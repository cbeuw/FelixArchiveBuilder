11 June 1993 Felix 970
Believe the Bosnians
Dear Editor,
I read an article entitled
'Refugees' which appeared in Fleix,
Issue 967.1 felt obliged to give my
opinion to your magazine which I
enjoy reading and respect.
I trust Felix operates on a
freedom-of-speech basis, and
therefore I expect and look forward
to seeing my article published in
your forthcoming issue.
As a student magazine one may
feel reluctant to write articles
beyond the academic scope.
However, since the topic is tragic,
it must concern us all, whether
students or not.
The recent waves of refugees sent
across Europe were as a result of
barbaric crimes and ethnic
cleansing tactics. The future of
these refugees had been under
discussion, behind closed doors, by
politicians who for more than a year
have failed to stop a crime on an
international scale. Tens of
thousands of civilians have been
missed or killed, and another two
million have been made homeless
and refugees.
These refugees have put trust and
faith in the international community
and the new world order, hoping to
return to their lost land, the
concerned politicians have been
drawing maps and putting plans.
Until now no map has been finalised
waiting for the aggressors to finish
their aggression. We have seen
several retreats from representatives
of the international community in
favour of groups of criminals who
tortured to death civilians in
concentration camps and subjected
men and women to unspeakable
crimes. These refugees are betrayed
if we realise the hopeless disarray
of the U N , fee loss of credibility
and the constant retreats of its peace
envoys. These refugees have been
denied weapons to defend
themselves and have been given
imaginary promises and false hopes
of help and support. These refugees
are now and might always be
displaced from their homes and let
down by those who have the saying
but hesitant or unable to implement
it. These refugees are now in
absolute misery, cut off in isolated
communities. For my part whether
a Londoner or outsider, I do not see
it nice at all to find beggers on the
streets, anywhere, whether refugees
or not. I must say that I feel very
sad. It is irritating. It is also morally
hard to ask for help, especially
when the person asking for help
really deserves it. These refugees
should learn very soon that begging
on the streets will not return their
homes. These refugees must learn
very soon that even if they make
fortunes out of begging, these
fortunes are not theirs as long as
they are refugees. The only fortunes
they may have are their lost homes
and hopes; their lost souvenirs,
identity and dignity.
What is required now is that: the
U N should honour its commitments
and match actions with words if a
sort of credibility is to be
maintained. Having failed to do so
for more than a year, I suspect that
will never happen. Of course, I am
disappointed. There is one thing left
to look at. History. It taught us that
unjust settlements can never be
settled but have always been a
source of further conflicts. There
must be a just and fair settlement.
There must be honesty.

Christ is the lightbulb
of my life
Dear Jonty,
Flattering as it is to become a
principal character in "The Amazing
Adventures of Andrew the Abstract
Entity', might I enquire whether the
cartoonist actually read my article?
My intention was not to promote
belief in God, or as the subtitle read
'to justify faith in religion' but to
levy what I felt to be a valid
criticism against institutionalised
religion. I am, by no means,
confident enough in my own belief
to tell others what to believe. I think
it is crucial that any such belief is
founded on personal convictionâ€”
not the sort of aggressive
evangelisation that is attributed to
me in the cartoon.
To give the cartoonist his (or her)
due, the title, subtitle and picture
may have misled them. The original
title of the article was 'Religion: A
Necessary Evil'. I am partly to
blame for not having looked for a
suitable picture. I had been thinking
more of a painting of the Spanish
Inquisition than a photograph of a
light bulb wearing a suit.
The fact that I do profess myself
to be a Christian is incidental to the
argument I was putting forward in
the article. I tried to establish how
religion, which generally is linked
to strong ethical and moral codes,
could become the source of violence
and hatred. It is a curious irony that
I believe modern religious
institutions must avoid.
Naturally' I respect the need for
editorial control of media, but
perhaps this incident serves to point
out the need for caution when
making changes to submitted
articles without due care. I look
forward to featuring in 'The
Amazing Adventures' again!
Yours sincerely,
GeoffMaxwell, Elec Eng UG2.
