Felix 970
Sex and the Ents posse
union
11 June 1993
We've been biding time this term,
with our spankin' discos every
Friday, and now we've arranged a
nice goodbye present for you all.
For the next two Fridays,
Atmosphere will continue to play its
usual heady mix of all things good,
be it indie, dance, retro, rock or just
good old fashioned pop music. If
you've just finished your exams,
then why not come out and see what
hundreds of people come to enjoy
every week. There'll be a late bar
til lam, disco til 2am and a happy
hour from 8.30-9.30pm (all drinks
reduced by 20%). Doors open at
8pm.
For the last night of term (Friday
25th June), we've arranged a
groovie bag of comedy, packed full
of some of the best names in the
comedy circuit.
Headlining the whole shebang are
the Rubber Bishops, a musical
comedy due, who normally
frequent the hallowed Comedy
Store and Jongleurs. They have
been described as 'effortlessly
funny, delightfully inconsequential
and quite unmissable', but I would
rather describe them as 'simply
hilarious'. The compere for the
evening is Richard Morton, the man
who received the Time Out
Comedy Award for 1992. Like the

Rubber Bishops, he has regularly
appeared at the Comedy Store,
Jongleurs..., and has a reputation
of being one of the sickest
comedians around. He has been
described recently as 'the new sex-
king of comedy' and with a few
songs such as 'Daddy was a Sperm
Bank', who am I to argue. Support
will be announced nearer the date
(see the next Felix for details).
There will be a bar til lam, disco
til 2am, and a happy hour from
8.30-9.30pm. Doors open 8.00pm,
with the support act onstage at
9.30pm.
So, how much does it cost for this
fiesta of all things funny I hear you
cry! Well, for a line up which
would normally cost around £8 at
other venues, we're just looking for
the tiny sum of £2 in advance.
Tickets are available from the
Union Office now (1st floor, Union
Building), and as this is the last
event of the year, like previous
events, it is liable to sell out in
advance. Buy your tickets now and
avoid the disappointment of being
left out in the cold. Kiss your cares
goodbye and have more fun than
you could shake a shitty stick at.
Andy.
