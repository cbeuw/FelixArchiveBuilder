Tonight Preview
Brixton Academy - Reggae
Awards
Lots o'names, familiar and not so
familiar, playing tonight; Tippa Irie
is, worryingly, the biggest name
here, but Chaka Demus, Peter
Hunningale and General Levy are
among the notable presences
tonight. Anticipate a heavy ragga
influence over the proceedings, but
it should be a fun evening for all
aficianados. £15. Starting at 7pm
and running until 2am.
Cranes/ Slowdive - Clapham
Grand
More ambient gothery as the
straggly leftovers of 1985 gather to
debate whether the Sisters have sold
out, and to do each other's eyeliner.
Expect a few nightmares and
neuroses to come swirling (that's
'swirling', readers - sic. Ed) out of
the Rockinghorse Room amid the
dead giveaway odour of ammonia
and sulphates perfumed with
patchouli, and don't go dressed as
a Morticia-like for a laugh. Well
ethereal, my beery mates said. Aye,
I agreed. Right eerie. £7.50.
7.30pm until lam.
Omar - Klimax at Chat's Palace
Smooth and ultra-sophistico
bedroom soul from the voice who
brought us 'There's nothing like
this' nearly two years ago now.
Jeez. Don't time fly? Nonetheless,
I'm sure you recall the poetic
heights of 'Sip a glass of cold
champagne wine / The rug that we
lie on feels divine', and imagined
the sort of cheapo geek responsible
for such egocentric drivel. And
what do you pay for lots of chat and
stuff about satin sheets? a mere £7.
It's a snip at twice the price, and
you've worked hard; Go on, treat
yerself, loves, 'cause you deserve
it. 10pm 'til late.
Utah Saints - Rocket (phone for
details)
Dance-friendly technorock
sampling pop de classique; in yer
face and dead groovy with snooks
well and truly cocked at their
former post-gothic industrial
cyberpunk alteregos, Cassandra
Complex. Very sharp-eyed and
inventive stuff, and, if they play it,
'Something Good' will be the
nearest thing to a live date Kate
Bush has done in absolute aeons.
over their cheeks. They played here
a couple of years back, you know,
and I was there, and they were
good, Lardi-Lardi-da-da. £4, from
8.30pm. N . B . This gig may be
cancelled, due to Levitation's
sudden absence from Bob Smith's
birthday party (see Sunday), and the
fact that it was supposed to be a
warm-up event. I advise you to get
on the blower.
Cranes: 'Don't talk rubbish
Therapy? - Forum
Well, I suppose I'd better apologise
for thinking them Welsh, when in
fact they're Irish with a capital 'Ire'.
Do you like that? It's called wit, you
know. Songs of the nasty, brutish
and short (a description that seems
to be in vogue again) variety, this
foray into the public domain comes
highly recommended by yours
truly. No support, but then again,
none necessary or even desirable.
It's probably just a one-off to
showcase the 'Face the Strange'
E.P. (Don't forget to say that it was
reviewed last issue - sic. Ed) I
know, I know! 'Face the Strange'
was reviewed last issue, and was
well-liked. So much so that the
reviewer would like his copy back,
Mr Gareth 'Queer as Fuck' Light.
£8. From 7pm.
Levitation/Land of Barbara/Out
of my hair - Splash Club at Water
Rats
Don't know about the others, but
Terry Bickers' Levitation are
always a must, brilliant songs that
leave former band The House of
Love with huge quantities of
smashed chicken foetus schlepped
Of course I look like Robert Smith'
Saturday 12th
Television/ No Man - Forum
Now then, Davros m'dear, you may
be a bitter and twisted old jazz
hipster with but one of yer
compositions gracing the pop
market, but you shouldn't be so
keen to bury Tom Verlaine et al
(Who is this ' A l ' bloke? he seems
to work with everyone - sic. Ed).
Gaaan... stick on Stephen Duffy an'
shaah us yer pissaaah... £12.
7.30pm.
Fleadh '93 - Finsbury Park
Fucking hell. Where to begin. Bob
Dylan. Van Morrison. Hothouse
Flowers. Pogues. Fat Lady Sings.
Marxman. Runrig. Kirsty MacColl.
Mary Coughlan. The Four of Us.
The Men They Couldn't Hang.
Lindisfarne. StiffLittle Fingers. I'll
stop there, I think; £25, and several
more bucketloads of bands on top
of that. From 12noon.
Senseless Things - Old Trout,
Windsor Solid, vividly-reproduced
guitar power-pop that's at its best
when they perform live, and in the
most tranquil venue for, ooh,
hundreds of miles. They can tend
towards the active, too, Cass and
the things sans sense, and they're
quite good at taking care. of
audience participation et cetera...
£6, from 8.30pm.
IZIT - Paradise Bar
Also playing the Jazz Cafe on
Monday, this is one of the latest
crop of jazz fusion bands we're
hearing good things of. You are
probably not paying the slightest bit
of attention as per fucking usual, but
you are seriously advised to go and
see these at some point, because I
intend to, and at a £5, £4 to you as
students, you really can't go wrong
this time. From 8pm to 2am.
Sunday 13th
Freaky Realistic - Marquee
Fun, Fun, Fun. And we'll have fun,
fun, fun. Last seen drinking
Daddy's home beer (five get
overexcited). I am mad from
Scandinavia... Must be crazy, and
Sagittarius, 'cause I'm a Leo, and
I'm hilarious.... And before you
could say 'repetitive strain injury,
and after a nasty bout of myalgic
encephalomyelitis, too', they led
him away... fun, fun, fun... from
7.30pm.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS: The
Cure/ Carter USM/ Sugar/ Belly/
The Frank & Walters/ Senseless
Things/ Catherine Wheel/
Kingmaker/ The Family Cat &
More - Finsbury Park.
When I was a lad, my dad used to
say to me 'Son, when you're all
grown up, be a smug semi-talented
bastard who's as rich as God'. I'm
nearly there, dad. All I've got to do
is finish my debut novel, and wait
for my dazzled audience to swarm
like a whole bunch of bees on heat.
Bob's plan was a cracker, too. take
yer laces out yer trainers, smear yer
bright scarlet lipgloss all over yer
face, and pour a few vulnerable
sighs into a microphone for a few
hours. Stay credible for a further
twenty years by having the coolest
bands around support you
periodically, too. Strange as it may
seem, but I'm rather of the opinion
that that says it all. £18.50.
Admission at 1pm.
JC001/ Free Speech/ The Phuse
- Planet Soul at Orange.
Really fast hard shit with a strongly
anti-fascist message coming at you
from JC001, the fastest rapper in
the country, nay, the World.
Something of a rising star, his truly
cosmopolitan background and
mesmerising presence make him a
real spectacle for the Orange.
Should be spellbinding. £6, from
8.30pm.
