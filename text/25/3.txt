CIRCULATION: 1.200
FELIX C A L L I N G
In this issue of Felix, w
e h
a
v
e concentrated
on bringing our views up-to-date with an account
0
1 college activities which have taken place during
the long vac', and b
y giving a preview of s
o
m
e of
the outstanding events of the A
u
t
u
m
n term. H
e have
not produced a Freshers' issue, filling our pages
with exhortations to rally round, keep the flag
flying, etc., etc., since this would b
e unfair to
our established readers, nevertheless, w
e take
this opportunity of urging every Freshman to take
s
o
m
e part in Student activities.
The aim of this paper is to provide an inde-
pendent, objective view, unbiased by sectional in-
terests - this can only b
e d
o
n
e properly if the
different shades of opinion are c
o
m
m
u
n
i
c
a
t
e
d to us,
(preferably in writing). Letters, articles, sug-
gestions and c
o
m
m
e
n
t
s
, of a provocative nature are
particularly welcome, but please try to m
a
k
e your
contribution a constructive one. "The Hops",
"Culture at I.C.", and "Social colours" w
e
r
e the
subjects m
o
s
t hotly contested last year; n
o doubt
other controversies will arise in the future -
Felix thrives on t
h
e
m

Although Felix caters primarily for h
o
n
e con-
sumption, m
a
n
y copies are sent to past students
both at h
o
m
e a
n
d abroad. W
e are always very
pleased to record n
e
w
s received directly or indi-
rectly from our far flung colleagues.

It is becoming distressingly apparent that the
present system of recognition of student achieve-
m
e
n
t by the student Unions is m
o
s
t inefficient and
biased. At present only those w
h
o are giants in
the field of athletics gain honour.
N
o thought is given to that increasingly large
proportion of students w
h
o would very m
u
c
h like to
fcariloipate in the: joyful activities "if only
they h
a
d the time", m
e
n w
h
o work.hard both ay day
and b
y night.
I would therefore suggest that a n
e
w club b
e
formed, in the m
a
n
n
e
r of the other august clubs,
for those students w
h
o have "never d
o
n
e anything for
the College". T
h
e n
u
m
b
e
r would h
a
v
e tobe strictly
limited a
n
d to effect this a point system could b
e
introduced: say,—10 pts. for attending the Annual
Sports,—§ pts. for going to a h
o
p
,
+
1
5 for going to
lectures, a
n
d s
o on. T
h
e holding of any Union
office ot the gaining of colours would immediately
dlswualify m
e
m
b
e
r

K
a

m
b

r
s
, elected bypop-
Jalar vote in each college, could b

played o

QUEENIE'S REBORN
The Ayrton Hall refectory on the first floor
of the U
n
w
i
n building will already b
e familiar to
m
e
m
b
e
r
s of the College. It is a greatly enlarged
'Queenie's', the refeotory run for m
a
n
y years by
Mrs. Bohling in the south extension of Guilds. T
h
e
main entrance to the building, (the old Royal Col-
lege of Needlework), is in the Imperial Institute
Road, opposite the Post Office. Another entrance
is just round the corner in Exhibition Hoad, a
n
d
there is also a route from the ground floor of
Guilds. T
h
e n
e
w hall is of a size comparable to
the College refectory in the Union building, and
will cater for 200-300 persons. It is h
o
p
e
d that
it will ease the lunch-time load on the other re-
fectory.
On the second floor is the Guilds Library and
in o
n
e corner of this will b
e found the n
e
w h
o
m
e of
the Union Library. T
h
e latter will be open between
o
n
e and t
w
o o'clock, and between five ana six.
However, through the cooperation of Mr. James, the
Guilds Librarian, it will also b
e possible to bor-
r
o
w books during the Guilds Library hours, viz:
ten to five, M
o
n
d
a
y
s to Fridays.
A m
o
r
e detailed survey of the Ayrton Hall re-
fectory and the U
n
v

n building will appear shortly
