1951 w i l l surely go down i n history as
"Cambridge's Year". Having won the Boat Raoe
and beaten Yale and Harvard i n America, the
Cambridge college crews proceeded to win six of
the nine events at Henley and ended the season
with their Goldie crew winning the Eights f o r
Great B r i t a i n i n the European Championships. As
a result of t h i s high standard, competition i n the
Summer Regattas was keen and the races fought out
stroke f o r stroke.
Having won the Thames Cup at Walton, the I.C.
1st VIII went to Reading with high hopes, and with
a l i t t l e more stride i n the second minute, might
well have won. However, a f t e r a very exciting
race, St. Catherine's (Camb.), the f i n a l i s t s , beat
them by a canvas. So to Marlow. Here the Eight
were drawn against Clare, second on the r i v e r at
Cambridge and stroked by the redoubtable David
Jennens who l e d Cambridge to so many great v i c -
t o r i e s t h i s year. The crew rowed extremely well,
led Clare o f f the start and hung grimly on to a
lead of one-third length f o r more than half the
distance. From here to the f i n i s h the greater
s o l i d i t y of Clare at the f i n i s h of the stroke be-
gan to t e l l and they slowly pulled up to win a
very good race by half a length. Clare went
through to the f i n a l .
Marlow r e a l l y begins the Henley fortnight - a
Royal Regatta, whioh t h i s year w i l l be remembered
by a l l who saw i t for some magnificent rowing and
racing on a l l four days of a very hard-fought and
exciting character. Drawn against Peterhouse
(Camb.), I.C. paddled up to the start i n fine
f e t t l e , though not as f a r advanced as t h e i r coach
had hoped owing to one or two mishaps during
t r a i n i n g . S t i l l the crew looked good and f e l t i t
and rowed a race which neither they nor Peterhouse
are l i k e l y to forget i n a hurry.
Both crews struok 37^ i n the f i r s t minute and
I.C. were ahead at the f i r s t signal. At the
Barrier both were s t r i k i n g 35 and Peterhouse were
s l i g h t l y i n the lead. At Fawley Peterhouse were
leading by nearly half a length i n a time of 3
min. £8 sees, and both crews were s t i l l striking
35. At Remenham Club, I.C. began to take i t home
and raised their rating. Peterhouse replied and
at the mile signal both crews were s t r i k i n g 38
with Peterhouse just i n the lead. This rating
was held the whole of the way along the enclosures,
both crews fighting i t out stroke for stroke and
v i r t u a l l y l e v e l u n t i l the last few strokes when
Peterhouse pulled ahead to win by a canvas. A
very fine race. The time, one of the fastest
of the day, was 7 min. 8 sees.
Owing to vac. work, the crew had no further
t r a i n i n g before Kingston Regatta and t h i s t o l d i t s
tale i n the way the crew scrambled home i n t h e i r
f i r s t heat. However, they improved with eaoh
heat and just l o s t the f i n a l to Argosy B.C. by a
quarter length.

In July, sixteen members of the I.C.A.C. had a
twelve day tour of Denmark.
The party had a short stay at Odense. Having
v i s i t e d many places of interest, we had u Batch i n
the evening with the University. Although we had
f i r s t and second places i n nearly a l l the track
events, the match was lost, according to their
calculations!
A weak was spent at Ballerup, just outside
Copenhagen. Five days were had i n sightseeing,
involving late nights and e r r a t i c meals! This inev-
itably lowered our standard of a t h l e t i c s , but were
able to sake a good show at Horsholn, c o l l e c t i n g an
assortment of pots.
A quick v i s i t was made to Blsinore, where we
were the guests of the town. Having seen Hamlet's
castle, had a banquet(and a much needed siesta!) we
competed against teams from Norway, Sweden, Finland
and Denmark. I.C. reached the f i n a l s i n some events,
but the standard was very much international.
Our f i n a l match was at Aarhus, I.C. again
superior i n track events, but the Danes better i n
f i e l d events, the matoh being l o s t 57-61.
Many things w i l l be remenbered of the tour.
Perhaps the occasion when we discovered, too late,
that excess fares are'nt paid at the b a r r i e r - Sasray
bailed us outt Or the very tipsy Dane who f e l l out
of a carriage door, backwards, with an unsuspecting
passenger! The dance, enlivened by Shnaps, at the
Students Hostel, and the numerous sing-aongs. The
boaters worn by the team- they had their uses!
Our thanks go to Norman Bamways f o r arranging
the tour so well, and to the Danish f o r such over-
whelming h o s p i t a l i t y .

The team which went on the club's Devon Tour
at the and of June was weakened by the absence of
several of the bast players. As a result the matches
•era marked more by inaividual achievement than
c o l l e c t i v e success. Brightest i n the spectrum of
b r i l l i a n c e was Holy Reynolds who reached a score of
24, for the f i r s t time i n his l i f e , after taking 5
wickets for 29 in tha game against Tavistock. Rambau'E
end Wyles each made a useful score in innings which
would otherwise have bean t o t a l losses, wot less
outstanding i n a different sense, was that batsman
who contrived to be bowled f i r s t b a l l twice in the
same day.
By the sea at Paignton, or in'.the timbered
buildings of old-world Uxater, the players were able
to relax from thair daily cares. This they did with
great success, and Gales, .vardle and the t h i r s t y
Kitchener astonished a l l who beheld them.
