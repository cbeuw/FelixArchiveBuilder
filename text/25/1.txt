LONG VAC. TRAVELS
GETTl NG AWAY FROM IT ALL
FROM OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
This year's long vacation has been char-
acterized by the range of the travels under-
taken. It i s as i f I.e. men had vied with
each other for the d i s t i n c t i o n of t r a v e l l i n g
the farthest. Their wanderings cover four
continents. Prizes for the furthest destin-
ation go to three parties who went to America,
Asia and A f r i c a respectively. David G r i f f i t h s
and Bryan P i l e were among several Miners who
corssed the Atlantic to v i s i t goldmines i n
Canada, where, they admit, they "staked no
claims but claimed a few steaks". Sam Mossman
and George sturt flew to Bahrein Island i n the
Persian Gulf, there to interest themselves i n
o i l free from p o l i t i c s . Wally Goss took a
University soccer eleven on a tour of Kenya
and describes his experiences i n the next column.
As usual the Mines sent a contingent to the
Gold Coast, over 2000 miles away. Other
v i s i t o r s to Africa were Brian purslow and
CM. Hargreaves who took a boat to Tangier
and returned overland through Spain.
There were the usual hordes of penniless
I.C. men scouring Europe for the lowest dives
and cheapest hotels. Spain and Austria again
seem to have been popular i n direct proportion
to the favourability of their exchange rates.
Pour members of I.C.W.A. were seen i n an
innsbruck beer garden swigging lager from
large tankards i n the company of leather-
trousered Tyroleans, (from a usually reliable
source). Near Seville, Stephen wearne nearly
built a dam on the Guadalquiver, was shaved
by a barber and escaped a v i s i t from your re-
porter only because he was making up to a g i r l
in the local cigarette factory at the time.

K E N Y A S O C C E R T O U R
On July 26th. the London University Soccer
Club party l e f t London Airport to f l y to Kenya
for a Tour of IB games at the i n v i t a t i o n of the
Kenya Football Association. The party comprised
a Vice-President of the Club, myself, the Secre-
tary, and 18 other players drawn from 8 Colleges.
The Tour covered 38 days on the Island of Zan-
zibar. Both games in Tanganyika were played at
Dar-es-Salaam, whilst the 15 In Kenya were spread
over 7 at Nairobi, 4 at Momba^sa, 2 at Kisumu and
2 at Nakuru. Of a l l these 10 were won, 3 drawn
and 5 lost, with 49 goals scored against 20 - i n
a l l a very creditable performance considering
that at one stage 9 games were played i n 13 days'.
My reflections upon returning home are
twofold, from the s o c i a l and from the f o o t b a l l
aspect. Most s t r i k i n g to a newcomer to thi3
part of the world la the presence of large
numbers of Indians as part of the population.
The white, or European, comrminltles are small and
somewhat isolated, and as a r e s u l t their way of
lifeisconaiderably freer than ours, aided and
abetted by the absence of the austerities of the
present day B r i t i s h Isles. , The cost of l i v i n g
is s l i g h t l y higher, but o f f s e t t i n g this are the
considerably higher salaries and the much lower
income tax rate - maximum 3/6d. i n the £1. A
non-graduate teacher, for instance, would com-
mence at a salary some £300 higher than his coun-
terpart here at home. Much has been done to
educate and house the African native, but i t i s
a slow and laborious undertaking, and apart from
the immediate surrounds of towns, he remains with
a l l his inheritances but savagery and cannibalise.
Writing of the native brings to mind the
f o o t b a l l out there, for of the 18 games played,
but 5 were against all-white teams, the rest were
against African or Asian sides. It was the
African style of play that required some change
of tactics from the normal method of play, for
a l l Africans play barefooted, and as a r e s u l t ,
at f i r s t there was some hesitancy to treat the
bare foot as the booted foot would be treatedl
Accordingly the African had the opportunity to
get to the b a l l and then use his outstanding
speed and a g i l i t y to f u l l e f f e c t . But having
discovered the right tactics to overcome this,
the problem became less' acute, for the African
has no strategical brain, his f o o t b a l l i s
stereotyped and he cannot adapt i t to s u i t con-
ditious.
But i t was an experience to watch them,
and on occasions to control their games, one
which w i l l remain with me for always.
