£212
This was the amount collected bv the four
carol-singing parties who toured the district
at the end of last term. This has given a mag-
nifiicent impulse to our "War-on-Want"
Carnival effort.
A somewhat smaller amount has accum-
ulated in the ''swear box" in the Union Bar.
In kindness to the regular users of the bar.
we are not disclosing the sum.
Milk Bottle Tops are at last being col-
lected. Please bring all your tops from your
home or digs and throw them into one >f
the bags in the refectories. Try and wash
them first — the girl who has "volunteered"
for the job does not care for cheese.
Ths is the term when floats for the proces-
sion, and stalls for the fete, are built- We
are hoping that every club, society and dep-
artment will provide something.

This is our Carnival magazine, which is
still just alive. A dead magazine stynx even
worse than a live one. Please keep its pulse
beating by sending in an article. Perhaps you
had an interesting experience over Xmas.

Where can you listen to a first class jazz
band and eat as much as you like for 2/6?
Why, at the Carnival Lunch in the Concert
Hall next Monday, and every subsequent
Monday. Many students will remember what
a success these lunches were last year. We
hope the same will happen this year.
The organiser, Dan Elwyn Jones, needs
plenty of helpers to cut up rolls, rearrange
furniture, and so on. If you have the last
period off on Monday morning, please con-
tact him through the Union Rack or the Car-
nival Office, or simply turn up in the Concert
Hall at 12.00. noon.

ELIZABETH THOMAS
No, it is not too early to start thinking a-
bout the I.C, Carnival and a prerequisite of
a successful carnival is the choice of a suit-
able queen. However, after this introduction
to Elizabeth no further search for candidates
need be made.
Elizabeth is a third year chemist, whose
obvious charm, selfless nature has been un-
spoilt by the transformation from a girls'
high school to the rigours of I.C. She is a
pretty petite young lady with a lively sense
of humour and a modest, happy disposition.
Whilst at I.C she has made many friends
from those in Beit Hall upwards. In addit-
ion to an active social life Elizabeth has sup-
ported on the hockey pitch not only I.C.W.A.
but also the I.C. Mixed X I . This latter ex-
perience no doubt stood her in good stead
for the I.C.W.S.C. v. Soccer Club "hockey"
match last year in which Elizabeth's pract-
ised pose of demure innocence swayed many
decisions of the unmpires. As the centre of at-
traction in the Carnival procession Eliza-
beth's essential femininity and beautiful
smile will do much to increase contributions
to the "cause".
If there is any doubt in your minds as to
her suitability and indeed desirability this
would be readily dispelled by a meeting with
Elizabeth during which we have no doubt
that her smartness, grace and beauty will
impress upon you the fact that she she is
the ideal choice for Carnival Queen.

A U D R E Y ROUSBRIBGE
Audrey Rousbridge was born in Egypt
twenty years ago and came to England at
the tender age of three. Even at this age she
impressed all with her charm and the warmth
of her personality, although she never won
a baby competition. Educated at Firhill Man-
or Girls' School, the Friends' School, Lis-
burn, and Bishop Fox's School, she also got
through a tutor and a governess before get-
ting tired of them all and coming to IC to
read Chemistry.
Two poor scribblers like us cannot pos-
sibly do justice to this wholly delightful
young lady — we get that hazy feeling when-
ever she's around. Besides, it's just obvious.
Audrey is the only possible girl for the job.
She is charming, capable and Cor...! ! ! Any-
way she has all the qualifications to make
the ideal Carnival Queen- Vote for Audrey
and you'll never regret it.
