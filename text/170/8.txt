- 8 — FELIX
S P O R T
RUGBY
The last week of last term gave a bright
finish to the first half of the season with
nine of the ten gamels resulting in wins for
I.C. including the 1st X V ' s victory over
Reading University by 12 pts. to 3, the eight
successive victory for the B3's, and the B5's
25-5 win over Hermits making them the sec-
ond unbeaten side this season.
Last Saturday saw the start of the second
half of the season and with only three vic-
tories out of nine games, it would appear
to be a catastrophic beginning. However, a
closer look at the results shows that most
o f "the games were in fact closely fought out
in our annual battle with one of the few
clubs in London which can regularly claim
to field more sides that I C . , namely ESHER,
on Saturday fielded fourteen sides.
The 1st X V has a number of hard fixtures
to contend with in the next few weeks, start-
ing with last year's U.A.U. champions
Aberystwyth University at Harlington on the
morning, Jan. 20th, the day of the England v.
Wales international. The next day it is hoped
that the London Hospital Cup side will play
an I.C. Cup side, in preparation for the sec-
ond round of the University Cup, which this
year is against C.E.M. away. C E . M . once
more playing M . Weston, the English centre.
Supporters for all these games would be very
welcome.
The arrangements for the Easter tour of
Germany are well underway and full de-
tails should be announced soon.

Last term was one of mixed fortune for
the Hockey Club. On the bright side was the
excellent undefeated run of 10 matches by
the 1st X I , the good record throughout the
term of the 2nd X I and the weather, which
allowed all but two of the fixtures to be
played. However, the 1st X I did not maintain
their successful run, and did not win a single
match in the second half of the term.
The second round cup match against
Q.M.C. was played on a rain soaked pitch
which soon resembled a tank testing range
in midrwinter. After an early goal by Phillips
I.C. slumped and were 2-1 down at half time.
Clarke equalised in the second half when I.C.
did most of the attacking, but by the end
both sides were fighting the same foe — mud,
CROSS C O U N T R Y
With the University again taking the cream
of our runners, the three cornered match
against Ranelagh Harriers and Birmingham
University held at Petersham resulted in us
being rather defeated.
1. Birmingham A . — 30
2. Ranelagh H . — 62
3. I . C — 112
4. Birmingham B. — 119
It was somewhat unfortunate that this
particular match, that would have put our
full strength team to the test should have a-
gain been the subject of this continually con-
traversial matter. However, we were to show
our true potentialities for the following
Wednesday 6th December in the 4 x 3.2 miles
Borough Road Relay held at Osterley, John
Cleator and Ted Wilkins both managed to
get within 1 second of the course record but
despite the almost equally commendable per-
formance of John Collins and Dave Ham-
monds, Reading University just managed to
pull it off.
1. Reading U . — 69 mins 5 sees
2. I . C — 69 mins 11 sees
3. Birmingham U . — 69 mins 30 sees
On Saturday 9th December the University
of London Championships took place. The
course, of 6 miles over sandy heath, proved,
as expected, to be extremely fast. The indivi-
dual title was won by Farrington of U.C.
(27.59). Ted Wilkins was only 4 seconds be-
hind (28.03) with John Cleator just behind
in third place (28.09). John Collins running
to his usual form was 5th, and Dave Ham-
monds and Jeff Greenleaf following up at
14th and 15th made sure of I.C. retaining the
team championship for the sixth successive
time with 39 points to U.C.'s 62 and 147 of
St. Barts- I.C. II led in by a fast improving
sturdy little fresher from New Zealand P.
Moss (29th) did well to come in 6th.
This race also incorporated the I.C. inter-
collegiate race which was won convincingly
by R.C.S. Guild's were second, this result
counts towards the sports day results.
With much fewer University commitments
this term it is hoped that the club will again
show the form and promise of which it has
the capabilities.
and the match ended in a draw. The replay
will take place on Jan. 31st at Harlington.
The 1st X I have lost both matches played
ths term. A much weakened side lost the
first match with U . C , the first defeat in the
hands of a college side. In the second match
against Old Dunstabliarte the team played
well until mid-way through the second half.
However, they went to pieces and conceded
three goals.
Th team records to date are:
P W D L F A
1st X I 16 7 5 4 24 19
2nd X I 9 5 2 2 28 15
3rd X I 7 1 2 4 10 21

On the whole, the results of last term were
disappointing. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd XI's
were well-placed in their respective divisions
of the U . L league and with luck we should
be champions of at least two of them. How-
ever, the results of the lower teams, with the
exception of Ex. 7th, leaves much to be de-
sired, although the 4th X I who without a
win before Christmas beat St. Clement Danes
G.S. 3rd X I , 10-0 last Saturday, with Ben-
nett scaring 3 and Keg 5. This followed 3-3
draw with the Institute of Education the pre-
vious Wednesday.
On Wednesday, 10th Jan., failure by St.
Mary's, Twickenham, to turn up at Harling-
ton meant that the 1st, 2nd and 5th XI's were
without opposition, but a 1st v. 2nd game
proved to be an interesting one, the 1st X I
winning 7-2. John Preece scored 4 goals. A
cancellation on Saturday meant that the 1st
X I will now play the second round of the
U.L. cup on Wednesday, without having had
a competitive game since before Christmas.
The Ex. 7th, considerably strengthened by
the promotion of higher team players, beat
Politechnic 5-1, Alan Logan scoring 3+
goals, while the 6th and 7th XI's lost 8-3
and 9-1 respectively to Chelsea III and
Thomas Cook.
On Wednesday, the 1st three teams are
engaged in University Cup ties and we are
fairly confident of success.

SPORTS C O M M E N T
The oft-repeated opinion that IC is guiltv
of the worst of college sins, lack of support
for the University, deserves a reply on the
subject of sport.
For the past few years, IC has dominated
U L sports scene to a very large extent, even
more than would be expected from the fact
of IC's 95% male population. The most ob-
vious example is Rugger in which I.C. has
won the U L cup for 8 of the last 10 years,
and has had 5 to 6 players on the U L team
this year. For one game last year there were
8 IC players. In football we've won the ^up
flor the last 3 years, and 4 members pla, re-
gularilv for the 1st X I . This year our hockey
team is second to none and stands well in
the K . O . championships, while the cross-
country club leads the rest of the University.
The Swimming Club has just won the U L
champs, and last year the Boat Club beat
the U L 1st VIII on more than one occasion.
