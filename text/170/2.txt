I can reveal exclusively to Felix that at
a reception held in the Mansion House re-
cently the President of ICWA. Miss Carolyn
Russell was proposed to by a Dutch gentle-
man, after only fifteen minutes conversation.
They fiad never met previously. However,
Carolyn was equal to the situation. Blush-
ing only ever-so-slightly she refused in her
most charming manner.

SKIFFY
SURVEY
TO A L L L E F T H A N D E D S T U D E N T S
During the next week, Felix is sponsoring
a survey of Lefthanded Students at I . C , to
help prove or disprove recent theories that
many lefthanded people have a tendency to-
wards the sciences. This has only become ap-
parent during the last few years owing to
the discontinuation of the practise of forcing
naturally leflthanded children to write with
their right hand. In connection with this sur-
vey we would be. grateful if all lefthanded
students and any interested righthanded stud-
ents for comparison, would come to Com-
mittee room A on Tuesday 23rd Jan. between
1 and 2 p.m. to answer a simple, question-
aire, (about which hand they use for games
etc.) or if this is not possible, to write to
'The Lefthanded Survey' c / o Penny Wil-
liams, Felix, via the Union Rack, stating
where and when they can be contacted.

C H R I S T M A S C O N C E R T
Towards the end of last term the Imperial
College Choir gave their annual Christmas
Concert in Queen Alexandra's House. With
Dr. E . H . Brown conducting, the Choir sang
with great gusto and were obviously enjoy-
ing themselves as much as the audience. The
Choir's salesmanship was not quite equal to
their singing; there were several empty seats,
which is unusual for this concert.
Excerpts from Bach's Christmas Oratorio
were followed by a medley of carols. The per-
formance was spoilt by a lack of balance in
the hastily improvised R . C . M . orchestra.
However, the concert was well worth going
to.
The choice of carols showed a welcome
lack of hackneyed favourites. A l l the same,
however, it might be better if the audience
were asked to sing carols which they are like-
ly to know.

Congratulations to Mines President John
Fairfield and Brenda who announced their
engagament over the vacation.
Phycology?
For the benefit of P.G.'s and those students
who actually come back early, and who
wondered who or what the h-11 the PHYCO-
LOGICAL SOCIETY was doing at I'.C. in
the week before the beginning of term; Stan,
the Union Porter explains that it is for the
study of Algae (any the wiser?). Stan has a
little anecdote about all this. Apparently some
dear lady came in and asked him where the
Phycological Society was meeting he, think-
ing she had an impediment in speech, pleaded
ignorance- When another delegate asked the
same question, Stan thought that perhaps
there was a society for these people with
speech impediments, and again pleaded ignor-
ance. But when a third person came in and
also asked for the Phycological Society, poor
Stan gave in, and after detailed investigations,
found out what it was really all about.
