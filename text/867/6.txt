Goat + Friends of Harry + The
Trudy + International Beat
Goat were a four piece heavy metal band who kicked
off the evening's entertainment to an awkward start.
With an active audience of two and a mass of placid
spectators the group gave a sound performance of a
fair variety of songs. Influences seemed to be Guns
& Roses, and Hendrix with a good underlying bit of
Led Zeppelin.
Friends of Harry started well. The first song they
played sounded remarkably like Whole Lotta Lovin' to
Do (Elvis). So did the second. The third sounded like
Rock A Hula Baby. The fourth sounded like
Whole I was not impressed.
Dodging the flying paper plates, The Trudy opened
with Countdown to Love. Singing like a rejuvenated
Blondie, henna Melissa bubbled infectiously in her
infamous mini-skirt above a joyfully frenzied guitar and
keyboard. As fun oozed out, the IC students danced!
T.L.M.B., hemlock, anti-slam, go see the Trudy.
Skankin'! Skankin'! Everyone a skankin'. The
International Beat played their instruments with 100%
lack of skill, delicate nuances stunningly absent tunes
made out of mix 'n' match patterns. But it worked.
The audience were happily inebriated and exhibited
the now traditional IC failure to mosh. Nobody knew
what any of the tracks were except Mirror in the
Bathroom which was greeted with space hopper
impressions by all and sundry.
The Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine and
Friends.

The Associates
—Wild and Lonely
Billy MacKenzie split the Associates in 1982, leaving
Alan Rankine. Now he has returned alone (well Billy
and 22 session artists anway) to reform the
Associates and launch a new LP, Wild and Lonely. No
moshing here, I'll tell you. Track after track of
preprogrammed computerised toss. It either sounds
like the Pet Shop Boys or David Bowie. The former
is hardly surprising since the production is handled by
the Pet Shop Boys Producer himself.
I'm sorry Billy, but you're really going to have to try
better than this whilst the old Bowie LPs are being
rereleased. Better luck next time, and leave the cover
design to a pro next time.

Birdland
An impressive five band line up drew the crowds to
fill the 4,000 capacity Brixton Academy on.March 31
(day of the Poll Tax riots).
With all due respect to the first three bands nobody
would give a shit about them, though Cud proved to
be the spark to ignite the crowd.
Carter T.U.S.M. set the crowd alight; impressive for
their first large venue gig. Ever relevant and ever
brilliant. Lines like 'It's midnight on the Murder Mile,
OK let's riot' seemed more cutting than usual.
Birdland stepping up from their small venues to this
put on the same old stage show as ever and it didn't
work.
Amusing enough for people who haven't seen it
before but here they just seemed pointless. Perhaps
there is no way back for them to the days of small
venues and fun rewards.
The memories are fun, but seeing them like this just
isn't worth it.
