W H I C H W A Y IMPERIAL?
Adrian Fletcher Looks Around
I N T H E P A S T , criticism, has
been levelled at t h e U n i o n s /
especially t h e constituent ones, f o r
concentrating t o o exclusively o n
M o r p h y D a y s a n d beer d r i n k i n g .
M o s t of this c r i t i c i s m has b e e n
rasther u n f o u n d e d a n d w i d e of t h e
mark, b u t nevertheless i t has usually
contained a grain of t r u t h .
I r e m a i n u n a s h a m e d l y i n favour
of 'sport' functions, because I t h i n k
they fulfil a vital role i n getting
people together enjoying themselves
a n d g i v i n g us a m u c h needed cor-
porate identity, b u t obviously they
must be seen as one p a r t of a n
existence a n d n o t t h e b e - a l l a n d e n d -
a l l of life. T o attain its f u l l potential,
the Student U n i o n must always b e
considering n e w ideas a n d question-
i n g its present practices, t h e former
b e i n g just as important as the latter.
Perhaps the fact that most of t h e
comments a n d ideas r e a c h i n g t h e
U n i o n Office here t e n d t o b e d e -
structive is one reason b e h i n d t h e
s o m e w h a t conservative outlook of
the U n i o n s i n the past. I t i s u n -
doubtedly true that b e i n g one's
o w n pace-setter is n o t so satisfactory
as h a v i n g a t h i r d party i n the b a c k -
g r o u n d With a l o a d e d shotgun. I
suppose that the connection b e t w e e n
m y b i l l i n g a n d t h e above is n o t
i m m e d i a t e l y obvious, b u t as t h e rest
of this article is c o n c e r n e d w i t h n e w
ideas, particularly i n the constituent
u n i o n / a c a d e m i c field, i t is wise to
state o u r "terms of reference" first.
Academic
matters
I . C . is a b i g college, 3335
students b i g to b e precise, a n d it is
correspondingly difficult to generalise
w h e n a c a d e m i c matters a r e c o n c e r n -
ed. L e t ' s start b y stating that the
obvious people o n the student side
to d e a l w i t h academic matters, are
the constituent unions. G i v e n this,
what's the score to date?
C a n d G have the most d e v e l o p e d
f o r m a l relationship of t h e three c o l -
leges w i t h a staff/student a c a d e m i c
sub-committee m e e t i n g r o u g h l y b i -
annually. T h i s covered a l l the d e -
partments, a n d several of t h e ideas
e m e r g i n g from it have f o u n d the'r
w a y into courses. O f c r u c i a l i m p o r t
ance i n the success of this venture
has been t h e g o o d w i l l a n d trust
existing between G u i l d s U n i o n a n d
the Senior Staff. M i n e s r e l y almost
entirely o n i n f o r m a l contacts, w h i c h
they find very effective, a l t h o u g h
they n o w have a student officer
specifically to deal w i t h a c a d e m i c
matters. R . C . S . departments v a r y —

cuss i n v i e w , of g o o d i n f o r m a l c o n -
tackts, w h i l e a n academic committee
set u p recently i n C h e m i s t r y seems,
for various reasons, to have got
nowhere.
It is interesting t o interject here
that the M a n c h e s t e r C o n f e r e n c e
thought that official representation
in a l l b u t very s m a l l departments
w a s essential, a n d that i n f o r m a l d i s -
cussions s t e m m e d from this.
A b o u t the future, the most i m -
p o r t a n t ' t h i n g is that the constituent
AD R I A N F L E T C H E R looks at three of t h e m a n y p r o b l e m s f a c i n g o u r
U n i o n s a n d their members i n t h e l i g h t of (some of) his experiences

to w o r k towards their solution.
P r o b l e m s w i l l v a r y from t h e

must n o t t r y to superimpose a
system that has w o r k e d w i t h A o n
B , w h o s e p r o b l e m s are different.
W h a t is significant, is the fact that
more t h a n evei before, constituent
college unions are concerned w i t h
these problems. W h a t i s essential, is
the realisation that n o t h i n g c a n
really be d o n e w i t h o u t m u t u a l trust
a n d g o o d w i i l b e t w e e n staff a n d
students.
onuS o n us asv officers is to p r o v i d e
information on a l l these o p p o r t u n -
i t i e s — h e n c e the appearance f o r
the first time this year of a year-
b o o k , u n i o n directory, a n d the very
successful single "what's o n "
c o l u m n i n this paper. W e are also
t r y i n g to m a k e more effective use
of t h e notice boards, b u t w i t h o u t
doubt the most important feature
in this field is F e l i x itself. T h a t is
w h y 1 find it rather tragic w h e n
some people, especially some sports
clubs w h e r e there is a potential of
b u i l d i n g u p 'college spirit', seem i n -
capable of letting the paper k n o w
w h a t ^oes on.
Because of differences i n t h e set-
ups it is impossible to l e a m a n y -
t h i n g direct f r o m E u r o p e i n this
case. B y a n d large they d o . however,
c h u m out <
) i n f o r m a t i o n than
us, b u t muc.4 of i t relates to
academic courses w h i c h a r e already
covered here b y the college p u b l i c -
ations. O n e G e r m a n handbook goes
so far as to c o m m e n t at length o n
the merits a n d de-merits of engineer-
i n g courses i n G e r m a n y a n d
Austria!
O n e must also, of course, talk in
terms of ideas as w e l l as concrete
fixtures. W h a t I said earlier about
n e w ideas filtering through, applies
more to t h e constituent U n i o n s b u t
is also true of I . C . U n i o n . A O i t a k -
d o w n i n c o m m u n i c a t i o n has o c c u r r e d
if even one U n i o n m e m b e r feels
that h e cannot chat to one of the,
U n i o n officers about an idea a n d
get a sympathetic hearing.
Education
where and
for what?
. I noticed recently that " E d u c a t i o n
for w h a t ? " is the title of a H u x l e y
society m e e t i n g i n the near future.
T h i s question, a n d the e q u a l l y i m -
porcant one of w h y people c o m e
here i n the first place, is a sphere i n
w h i c h t h e U n i o n has hitherto
p l a y e d n o part whatever. T r u e the
former p r o b l e m is h a n d l e d very ef-
ficiently by college appointments
organisation, s u p p l e m e n t e d i n t w o
cases b y the o l d student's associat-
ions,. W h a t about the latter?
E u r o p e a n U n i o n publications often
provide the o n l y information students
receive about their alternative places
of study. S o m e other E n g l i s h
U n i v e r s i t y U n i o n s operate systems
w h i c h enable potential u n d e r g r a d u -
ates to see the U n i o n a n d chat to
present students before they decide
w h e t h e r or not to accept a place.
Strathclyde goes so f a r as t o send
student speakers out to local
schools to give information a n d
answer questions. In fact, because
the t w o previous problems, I have
considered tacitly assumed that a
student has chosen the right course
of study for h i m or her, this m a y
w e l l b e the most important question
of a l l . W e l l , if y o u think so, let's
hear about it.
Onus on

T h e second p r o b l e m , t o u c h e d o n
briefly earlier, is o n e of c o m m u n -
ication between the U n i o n a n d its

ally whether the U n i o n s h o u l d g o
to the m e m b e r or d i e m e m b e r to
the U n i o n . I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n
has, again b y reason of itsi size,
chosen the latter course.—je. w e
