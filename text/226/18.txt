Rugby Cup
A GREAT FINISH
by BILL JENKINS
S H R U G G I N G O F F the effects of a four week lay off and the
-absence of a key player for almost two thirds of the match,
I.C. brought a damp and gloomy Harlington to light with a final
five minutes of superb rugby. During this period they scored two
tries, giving them victory over L.S.E. by 9-3 and a place in the
semi-final of the Gutteridge Cup.
F o r the greater part of the after-
noon the g a m e h a d b e e n exceeding'y
drab a n d consisted of l o n g periods
of indecisive p l a y p u n c t u a t e d b y

T h e early ascendency of I . C . was
brought to a premature h a l t after 25

finding room to move, beat three

D a i H o w e l l looks somewhat pregnant.
H a y , although perhaps out of

the mauls a n d m a d e several p o w e r -
