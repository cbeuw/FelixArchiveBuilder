At Ford we know that quality in cars depends on the calibre of
men. The pace of your career with us depends on that calibre as
surely as the speed of your car depends on the power built into it.
Ford build more and more cars, trucks -and tractors, need more and
more men. Tne headquarters of this expanding company is in
Brentford in Essex but ford is going ahead in London, Dagenham,
Liverpool and Swansea.
We need A L L kinds of graduates—mechanical engineers and
scientists, for design and development; arts men, scientists and
economists.
Our training programmes are tailored to suit individual needs.
Engineers may choose a two year graduate apprenticeship or shorter
training and appointment within a year; mere are courses for
finance trainees and graduate trainees—those interested in sales,
purchasing, industrial relations and marketing.
Graduates will find Ford rewarding! Salaries being at £960 per
annum minimum. Most arts and economics graduates will be
earning £1,150 in less than a year—engineers get an increase of at
least £100 at the end of each year of their apprenticeship. From
then acceleration depends on you.
Promotion at Ford is traditionally from within and graduates have
accelerated quickly here. Management Development operates to
make sure they can.
There's much to interest the graduates at Ford.
See your Appointments Secretary, or write for details to J S Smale,
Room 1/178, Ford Motor Company, Warley,

Wadham defeats I C
J ) E F E A T for I.C. by175 to 150
points against Wadham Col-
lege, Oxford, in a close-fought
round of University Challenge,
and a cup of terrible coffee were
tirt rewards of the thirty I.C. stud-
ents who travelled through the
fog to Manchester to support
their team at the recording of the
quiz at the Granada Headquart-
ers.
The I.C. team was composed
of Darshan Pandya (Chem. Eng.
PG), Mrs Margaret Heraty
(Maths 3),: Derek Boothman, capt.
(Physics 3), and John Chester
(Chem. 2), who were chosen last
term by a selection procedure
which received little publicity.
The reserve, Ke'th Cavanagh,
also accompnied the team, but
was not called upon.
