A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT.- Dear S i r ,
Although i t i s not my normal p o l i c y t o burden your columns w i t h my correspond-
ence, I f e e l that as Mr. Livosey* s e x t r a o r d i n a r y l e t t e r i b the main issue d i r e c t l y
challenges ray personal i n t e g r i t y , some sort of r e p l y i s necessary.
I s h a l l ignore the references t o a witch-hunt, and the a l l e g a t i o n that the ex-
ecutive i s t r y i n g t o prevent a lobby by " f i x i n g " dates. Any reference t o people w i t h more
than Mr. L i v e s e y 1
s meagre knowledge of these t o p i c s , w i l l confirm that these comments
are i n the f i r s t ple.ce w i l d l y wide of the mark, and i n the second, downright untrue.
With regard t o the second paragraph, the executive was concerned and i n t e r e s t e d
enough i n the subject of loans t o accord a lOCPb turn-out a t the Union meeting t o l i s t e n
to the views of the Union Members. The only trouble was that not enough of the l a t t e r
were i n t e r e s t e d enough t o t u r n up a l s o . ( C e r t a i n l y t h i s was not due t o l a c k o f p u b l i c i t y )
I am not p a r t i c u l a r l y concenned w i t h the f a t e of Mr. Livesey's motion as i t i s
p u r e l y p a r o c h i a l and whichever way the vote goes, I do not b e l i e v e any world s h a t t e r i n g
changes w i l l r e s u l t , I was extra*.jy disappointed.however that the loans t o p i c , which
co-old p o s s i b l y v i t a l l y e f f e c t many f i r s t and second year undergraduates, a l s o r e c e i v e d
-the "couldn't care l e s s " typo arproach. However i f Mr, Livesey expects me t o do some
penance and look humble a f t e r inquorate meetings, he i s being r a t h e r short s i t e d and
s t u p i d - he may be aware that I have other r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s which a l s o demand a t t e n t i o n .
Your correspondent appears t o have lowered himself t o the ranks of "student
p o l i t i c i a n s " - a breed of which I.C., t o i t s c r e d i t , has n e a r l y always been t h a n k f u l l y
