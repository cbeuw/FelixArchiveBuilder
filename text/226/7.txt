ICI Mond Division manufactures more than half-a-million tons a
year of organic chemicals, many of them based on petroleum feed-
stocks, as well as the traditional products such as chlorine and
caustic soda. Capacity is being increased by a capital investment
programme which is currently running at more than £20,000,000
a year, and in everything we are doing chemical engineers are
key men.
To match the increasing technological complexity of our processes
we are particularly interested in recruiting capable and enthusi-
astic young men to work on process design and development in its
widest sense, from research to full-scale production. Effective use is
made of such new techniques as the use of mathematical models in
process kinetics, scale-up and control studies, and the application of
computers to the design and optimisation of process flowsheets
and equipment.
Young men are deliberately given wide experience and substantial
responsibility which can fit themfor the many senior jobs to be filled
in the Division in the next 10 years.
If you wish to learn more about us, chemical engineers from Mond
Division will be visiting you shortly and can be contacted through
your own careers advisers. If this proves impossible, please contact:—
