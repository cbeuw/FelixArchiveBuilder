When will you own
your own house?
Earlier in life than your father did, when plans to
build 500,000 new homes annually come to fruition
in a few years time.
One thing is certain. No industry is going to expand
more dramatically in the next 20 years than the
building industry. It's got to, or Britain will be
one decaying and overcrowded slum.
Take Wates. They are among the biggest builders
and civil engineers in the country. But, more
important, they are among the most imaginative and
forward-looking.
In the next 15 years, Wates intend to double their
productivity.
To do this, they need graduates in science,
technology and the arts.
So does every firm in the country, but the point
about Wates is that their programme is going to
create a lot of room at the top.
And Wates will always, for preference, promote
within the company.

Or you can write to the Personnel Manager, Wates
Ltd., 1260 London Rd., S.W.16, and arrange a time

U.C.2—I.C.O
I.C. started this match against
the Cup holders in excellent
style, combining well and mov-
ing the ball quickly and accurat-
ely from man to man... the for-
ward line continually broke
through the Kings defence and
Hopwood was unlucky to see his
header go just wide from a
Crawford free kick. Such was
the pressure exerted by I.C., due
mainly to the wing forwards
snapping up chances, that it took
King's ten minutes to launch their
first attack.
K i n g ' s w e r e l u c k y to survive this
early p e r i o d , b u t o n c e they h a d
