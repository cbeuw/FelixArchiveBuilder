Bamber Gascoigne, "anchor man" of
University Challenge, talked to F E L I X in
the New Theatre public house, Manchester
as he relaxed after the evening's recording.
Bamber, wearing a brown suit and blue
shirt, de rigour for such a personality,
ordered a p:
"t of bitter and settled back,
saying "Right, what can I tell you".
H e said h e b e c a m e " A n c h o r m a n " of U n i v -
ersity C h a l l e n g e after a u d i t i o n i n g together w i t h
other journalists a n d a c t o r s — t h e c o m p a n y desir-

quizmasters to further the i m a g e of ' t h e p r o -
g r a m m e as a m o r e serious f o r m of entertain-
m e n t .
I n the earlier years, he used to set the
majority of the questions, b u t nowdays h e
o n l y sets the ocasional one, l i k i n g to pose the
m o r e frivolous question to l i g h t e n the proceed-
ings. A s k e d w h e t h e r h i s comments o n w r o n g
answers w e r e o r i g i n a l or p r o v i d e d for h i m , h e
r e p l i e d that he w a s p r o v i d e d w i t h the barest
m i n i m u m solution to each p r o b l e m b u t spent
an afternoon r e a d i n g r o u n d the questions i n a n
encyclopaedia.
H e is thus ,able to anticipate m a n y w r o n g
answers a n d to p r o v i d e just a little m o r e i n -
f o r m a t i o n than is r e q u i r e d . T h i s fortunately gives
an impression of great omniscience.
Setting quesaions h e said, is a v e r y difficult
task. T h e c o m p i l i n g of the questions bears n o
relation to the nature of the teams c o m p e t i n g ,
is b e i n g almost impossible to set "scientific

P E T E R MUL. L I N G S
by Colin
Peter Mullings, T V director and producer,
is an active man. His puckish face and
eves reveal h's humour; his pen-and-pencil
lined pocket betravs him as a writer and not
the actor he once hoped to be.
H e is at present director of U n i v e r s i t y C h a l -
lenge, amongst other things,, b u t his start Was
i n the theatre. I n 194?-> h e spent six months de-
s t r o y i n g his illusion that he c o u l d be a great
actor a n d i n 1946 b e c a m e a stage manager. H e
c o n t i n u e d in this l i n e u n t i l the m i d fifties w h e n
he i o i n e d G r a n a d a as a n acting floor m a n a g e r —
w h i c h involves responsibility for the scenery,
props, etc. for each set. T h e next step was p r o -
m o t i o n to floor m a n a g e r w h o s e job i t is to
represent the director on the studio floor: to
y e l l silently at studio staff or l e a d the audience
i n m o c k applause ( w h y not use a record?).
It was not u n t i l 1962 that h e b e c a m e a
director, h a v i n g done a certain a m o u n t of p r o -
d u c i n g already. A p r o d u c e r is c o n c e r n e d w i t h
organising a n d c o o r d i n a t i n g the p r o d u c t i o n of a
p r o g r a m m e . H e is responsible for the expend-
iture f o r the p r o g r a m m e a n d , except i n d r a m a
a n d "jimilar material, he selects the participants.
A director deals m a i n l y w i t h the script; i n
documentaries h e m u s t occasionally r e w r i t e
some of it a n d have it a p p r o v e d b y the author.
D u r i n g a performance he w i l l be seated i n the
control a n d m a y , i f the f a n c y takes h i m ,
gesticulate at the studio staff or m e r e l y w a v e
his arms w i l d l y i n the m a n n e r of one caught i n
q u i c k s a n d .
M r M u l l i n g s recieved n o f o r m a l t r a i n i n g as,
a director, the m e t h o d of initiation u s e d b y
G r a n a d a was s w i m m i n g - p o o l t v p e ^ - i n at t h e
d e e p end. So m u c h so that his first w e e k gave
h i m control of eight shows. A t first he w o r k e d
q u i t e a l o t o n adlvertising magazines, b u t i n
recent times he has concentrated on " U n i v e r s i t y

C h a l l e n g e " documentaries a n d educational p r o -
grammes. H o w e v e r , p r o g a r m m e s . are not his sole
concern; at present h e is engaged i n the p r o -
d u c t i o n of a booklet for the s u m m e r schools
p r o g r a m m e . T h i s k i n d of w o r k h e prefers to
d o at h o m e as there is less risk of interruption.
T h e pressure of his w o r k is v a r i a b l e : some
days h e m a y not go to the studios at a l l , on
other occasions he has h a d to w o r k u n t i l d a w n
p r e p a r i n g m a t e r i a l for that day.
H i s relaxation i s p h o t o g r a p h y , a l t h o u g h h e
feels that his w o r k depends considerably o n his
p h o t o g r a p h i c ability. It has tyjen a l i f e l o n g
h o b b y ; he developed his first film at the age of
ten a n d still has a monster lens w i t h w h i c h h e
d i d m u c h of his early w o r k — u n t i l the tragic
d a y w h e n his c a m e r a c o u l d bear the w e i g h t no
more. H e v i e w s t h e c o m i n g of colour television
w i t h m i x e d feelings, " R a t h e r l i k e seeing y o u r
m o t h e r Jo l a w d r i v i n g y o u r b r a n d - n e w R o l l s
over B e a c h y H e a d " . T o o often, he says, directors
h a v i n g n o sense of f o r m or b a l a n c e p r o d u c e
monstrosities i n b l a c k a n d w h i t e ; w i t h colour
their scope w o u l d be w i d e n e d .
A f t e r his early training i n advertising
magazines he is critical of contemporary a d -
vertising directors. O n e w i l l c o m e u p w i t h a n
idea a n d a l t h o u g h he cannot explain its m e a n -
i n g , h e m a y h a v e the ability to c o n v i n c e the
sponsor it is the right w a y , w h i l s t the m a n w h o
c a n think a n d explain his ideas is often i n c a p -
able of c o m m u n i c a t i n g t h e m effectively w
television. A s a result he detests advertising.
T h e average l i f e of a director is five years.
W h a t w i l l Peter M u l l i n g s do for the r e m a i n -
i n g t w e n t y years or so u n t i l retiring ? H e re-
cognises that he cannot continue as a director;
however, h e hopes to use the experience h e has
gained i n a l t e r i n g a n d a m m e n d i n g scripts to
w r i t e original scripts a n d thus r e m a i n i n the
business; "there's not m u c h else I can do".
