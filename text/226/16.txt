new men...
new knowledge...
new problems to be solved...
Today's children will grow up in a world that Is
being remade before their eyes. They will have a
wider range of opportunities. They will also face
problems calling for new solutions. Today's
children need the most imaginative and creative
teaching. Teaching by men and women who are
among the ablest of their generation... graduates
who are among the most outstanding of their
year. Teachers have greater influence on future
generations than any other profession.
What does Teaching offer you in return ?
New opportunities
Teaching is a vigorous and growing profession. It offers
the graduate greater opportunities t h a n ever before,
both i n developing professional skills a n d i n achieving
posts of influence a n d responsibility — often far earlier
t h a n i n m a n y other careers. F o r example, nearly half of
the men graduate teachers between 25:and 29 hold such
posts a n d receive salaries well above the basic scale.
A b o u t half o f those i n their 30's arc heads o f depart-
ments, earning up to £2,330, or hold even higher posts.
O n e fifth of those now i n their 40's are headmasters who
m a y earn salaries u p to £3,850. T h e prospects are even
better for graduates w i t h first or second class honours, or
a higher degree.
New ideas - new initiative
T h e mastery of teaching skills a n d the evolution of new
methods are a stimulating challenge. N e w discoveries
and new knowledge present teachers with problems for
w h i c h there are n o precedents. N e w communication
techniques a n d aids must be developed.
Training: an extension of your knowledge
Some graduates feel uncertain whether they are
temperamentally suited to teaching. T h e one-year
post-graduate training course equips you to start your
career confidently o n a basis o f practical experience
as well as theory.
