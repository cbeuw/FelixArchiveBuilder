Mooney excels
By B. Pichter
* ( ~ \ N E M U S T B E seen to do the right thine", so the old adage for
^ ' i m i c c e « s runs, although when these <"><Mal 'necessities' involve attend-
ing the Enetfn<wr's Dinner and Dance this is no longer a social chore
but an enjoyable evening's (and morning's) entertainment.
A siroerb m e a l w i t h lashings of
w i n e — i f y o u e m p t i e d your glass
frequently e n o u g h — f o l l o w e d b y
amusing speeches was certainly a fine
pre-reouisite for the ensuing dance.
Inevitably on such occasions M r .
M o o n e y seems able to excel h i m -

prehensible a n d s u c h novelty dishes

food, but tiny 'sprats' c o m p l e t e w i t h
h e a d a n d t a i l — d e l i c i o u s ) were,
served.
T h e d i n e r was f o l l o w e d b y speech-
es from D a : H o w e l l , W . F . F . M a r t i n -
H o r s t , A d r i a n F l e t c h e r a n d Pete
Foster. M r . M a r t i n - H u r s t spoke
about the difficulties of d e s i g n i n g
a n d m a n f a c t u r i n g cars, a n d the
£1,000,000 gambles one has to t a k e
w i t h any n e w m o d e l .
M r . F o s t e r subsequently satirised
this speech by t a l k i n g about " B a b "
a little m a n w h o solved a l l his m o t o r -
i n g p r o b l e m s - - i n c l u d i n g that irritat
i n g green light that seemed to g l o w
incessantly on his dash b o a r d — O i l !
M r . Foster must surely be one of the
most competent a f t e i - d i n n e r speak-
ers, w i t h his w i t t y incisive remarks.
U n l u c k i l y ? J e d Stone a n d the
Raiders w e r e absent, b u t it was pos-
sible to cover u p lack of f o r m a l
d a n c i n g ability b y suitable position-
ing i n the centre of the melee.
R i c h a r d M u r d o c h w a s the cabaret
artist a n d this was the most unfor-
tunate part of the m o r n i n g . H i s
'iokes' w e r e i n v a r i a b l y finisihed b y a
distinguished G u i l d s / n a n at the front,
w h o must have h e a r d his last r a d i o
p r o g r a m m e .
H i s h a l f h o u r act, w h i c h b y the
w a y cost £ 6 5 , was a d i s m a l failure.
T h i s d i d not reflect on the oc-
casion as a w h o l e , w h i c h was an i m -
mense success. T h e p e o p l e concerned
w i t h the organisation h a d obviously
nut i n a great deal of time a n d effort.
