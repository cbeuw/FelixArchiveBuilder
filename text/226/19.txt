CHEMISTRY EXAM CRISIS
OVER ?
" M o d " Battle
at Hop
Until last Saturday, although the " M o d " representation at the H o p had
been steadilv increasing throuehout the year, there had never been any
serious trouble. T h e fellows had been mere'v content to dance among
themselves—practising the latest steps—or to i ' " a* their girl-friends. U n -
fortunately, they now seem determined—; bly because of their
increased numbers—to disrupt the dances.
T H E P A R T O N E Final Examin-
ations for second-year Chemistry
undergraduates have been returned
to- their original dates. This was the
result of discussions between I C
President Adrian Fletcher and the
Head of the Chemistry Department,
Professor R . M . Barrer, last Wednes-
day.
H o w e v e r at the time of g o i n g to
press it seems even more l i k e l y that
t h e n a t i o n a l r a i l strike projected f o r
Valentine's D a y w i l l take p l a c e . T o
fu a r d against this t e n rooms have
een m a d e a v a i l a b l e i n H a l l s o f
Ttesidence f o r those entrants w h o
l i v e a considerable distance f r o m the
C o l l e g e .
A s a further safeguard the suggest-
ion m a d e b y M i k e Scott, R C S P r e s i d -
ent, that the exams s h o u l d b e d e f e r r e d
u n t i l the afternoons i n question has
been i m p l e m e n t e d .
Scaffolding
to go ?
A 20% INCREASE in parking
space bas been ach'eved in
the Southside (residents') car
Park by the efforts of the Car
arking Committee.
Ten places have been gained by
the removal of five vehicles whica
did not belong to current Southside
residents and were not registered
with the College, and another five
w h i c h w e r e registered b u t w e r e i n
a state ot disrepair are either oeiug
l e p a i r e d or nave been r e m o v e d .
O n e v e n i c i e h a v i n g neither i n -

a Scheme p u t l o i w a r d b y t h e C o m -
inutee to introduce diagonal p a r k i n g
places to the road in front of S o u t h -

increase i n the n u m b e r of places
available, w h i l e giving d u e a l l o w -
ance f o r (improved) access, a n d
w o u l d remove t h e ugly scaffolding.
Places w o u l d b e reserved for the
otiier (non-college) users of t h e r o a d -
w a y ( A i r S q u a d r o n etc.) a n d f o r
motor cycles a n d delivery vehicles.
It s h o u l d be noted that t h e r o a d -
way i n front o f Southside is a
general I . C . p a r k i n g place, b u t that
the c a r park a n d r a m p o n the E a s t -
side site is f o r H a l l residents c f
S o u b s i d e only.
T h e committee have also suggest-
ed that a gate b e installed at the
rear entrance t o t h e Southside park,
I.) prevent access t o the park from
that unlit direction at n i g h t — t h i s to
help prevent some of t h e frequent
thefts. T h e gate * v o u l d cost £ 4 0 t o
install, a n d as the park w i l l oe
closed o n the commencement of
East side is u n l i k e l y to materialise.
