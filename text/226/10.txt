C o m p l e t e p r o g r a m m e s p r o d u c e d
Some time ago u n d e r the initiative of the
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Section of the E l e c t r i c a l D e -
p a r t m e n t a s m a l l scheme was started to evaluate
the possible uses of television as a t e a c h i n g
m e d i u m w i t h i n universities. T h i s is part of a
larger scheme w h i c h is l o o k i n g into a w h o l e
series of teaching aids f r o m the o v e r h e a d p r o -
jector to videovrecorded p r o g r a m m e s . T h e
programmes p r o d u c e d so far are u n p o l i s h e d a n d
suffer from m a n y t e c h n i c a l faults, at the
m o m e n t they h a v e c o m e to a complete s t a n d -
still because the v e r y s i m p l e recorder that is
b e i n g u s e d ha$ h a d to go a w a y for repair. M o s t
of t h e faults w h i c h are noticeable at this sftage
are the results of the inadeauate e q u i p m e n t that
must necessarily be used for this s m a l l p i l o t
experiment. T h e w o r s t one b e i n g the b r e a k - u p
of the p i c t u r e w h e n e v e r cameras are changed,
due to lack of p r o p e r s y n c h r o n i s i n g equipment.
V i s i t i n g L e c t u r e r ' s r e a c t i o n s
So far these programmrnsi are b e i n g confined
to the h u m a n i t i e s p a r t of the second year course
as this does not interfere w i t h the degree
courses. A l r e a d y it seems that some visiting
lecturers w o u l d prefer to give 'their lecture b y
r e c o r d e d television as this e n a b l e s t h e m to use
a greater variety of models a n d illustrations
t h a n w o u l d be possible i n the conventional
lecture. E x p e r i m e n t s c o n d u c t e d i n the U S A
also seem to s h o w that i n some cases a student
is c a p a b l e of sustaining more serious attention
a n d of a c h i e v i n g greater retentivity w i t h tele-
v i s e d Ipc'ijrefi, possibly because he' feels that
he does not share' the lecturer w i t h so many
people. It is capable of b e i n g a more personal
m e d i u m than m a n y others.
E l e c t r o n i c E n l a r g e r
T h e p r o d u c t i o n of complete r e c o r d e d p r o -
g r a m m e s is not the o n l y aspect of television
that is u n d e r investigation. F o r 'the past year or
m o r e a n increasing use of television has been
made w i t h i n the l i v e lecture, for e n l a r g i n g de-
monstrations. S m a l l models can b e s h o w n to
large audiences, a n d demons'.i ii-ions set u p i n a
laboratory c a n be s h o w n to an audience i n a
lecture theatre. T h i s has obvious uses i n other
departments w h e r e , for example, a w h o l e class
c a n be s h o w n the same microscopic sample.
O t h e r U n i v e r s i t i e s
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e is l e a d i n g the field i n some
spheres of the study a n d use of television as an
educational m e d i u m , a l t h o u g h other colleges
have h a d a l l the p u b l i c i t y . Strathclyde i n
G l a s g o w a n d L e e d s are b o t h reported to be r u n -
n i n g extensive schemes b u t they are aiso interest-
ed i n the part that universities can p l a y i n p u b l i c
education a n d broadcasting, I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
b e i n g m a i n l y concerned w i t h studies of the use
of television w i t h i n the college department. T h e
s c h e m e at Sussex is a very m u c h smaller affair
w i t h o n l y one camera a n d n o recorder.
Cooperation with R.C.A.
O n e of the things that fa g r o w i n g out of this
increasing interest w i t h i n the E l e c t r i c a l D e p a r t -
m e n t i n the use of television a n d films is the
co-operation b e t w e e n that department a n d our
neighbours i n the R o y a l C o l l e g e of A r t . O n e of
the staff of tire R C A , M r . T r e v o r Scott, has been
s e c o n d e d to G u i l d s i n order to help w i t h the
p r o d u c t i o n of the television programmes a n d a
variety of films that are b e i n g m a d e i n the c o l -
lege. B y using some of the facilitiesi that they
h a v e i n their film a n d television u n i t it is be-
c o m i n g possible for better productions be
m a d e t h a n w o u l d b e possible w i t h the E l e c t r i c -
