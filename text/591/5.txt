"Experiment is always right,
the theory never!"
FELIX talked to Professor Eric Laithwiate, who will give the first
H.G. Wells Society lecture of the year on Monday evening.
I'd like to start oil by asking you a little
about your background, Prolessor. Was
there any particular event which got you
interested in science and engineering in
particular?
It's not so m u c h an 'event', it's the people
you c o m e across on your journey that i n -
fluence you. I was b l e s s e d with a very g o o d
physics master at school. I think I c a n place
it back to then. Plus I had parents w h o were
interested in things of that nature; my father
was a farmer y o u see, but he retired early.
H e s h o u l d have been an engineer, h e w o u l d
have made a very g o o d one.
Did you live in an industrial area?
Yes, but not o n e directly connected with
what I do now. I was brought up in a small
cotton weaving town, it was an industrial
village if y o u like, but I wasn't involved in the
cotton industry.
Did you have any hobbies as a child?
I h a d all sorts of hobbies as a child. I went to
secondary s c h o o l in the ordinary way so I
p l a y e d c r i c k e t a n d r u g b y f o o t b a l l a n d
things that o n e does at s c h o o l . P l u s I played
guitar, I had a p o p group in the 1930s, w h i c h
was ahead of its time! I've collected butter-
flies a n d moths ever since I c o u l d walk I
finished up writing a book on it. You've got
to get your money back s o m e h o w , y o u see!
Did you go straight to university to study
engineering?
N o I left s c h o o l to join the airforce in 1939
w h e n I w a s 18. It w a s during the airforce
years, I suppose, I really decided that it was
engineering I wanted to do, because at
school they never told me about engineer-
ing. In those days they never h a d careers
masters like they do now. I w o u l d have been
in the civil service if it wasn't for the war,
pushing a pen.
What did you do during the war?
I started as an instrument basher, of w h i c h
there is nothing lower, and graduated to get
a c o m m i s s i o n in 1943 a n d ended up at the
experimental station at R . A . F a r n b o r o u g h
w h i c h is where the interest really began a n d
all sorts of exciting things went o n there,
especially during wartime. I got a class five
release in 1946 to go a n d b e c o m e an under-
graduate at the age of 25 in Manchester,
and did a masters degree a n d then got a
s t a f f a p p o i n t m e n t a n d w a s a s s i s t a n t
lecturer for four years. I was then senior
lecturer a n d after that got the appointment
here.
I'm sure things will have changed since
your freshman days, but is there any advice
that you might give to freshers?
It hasn't c h a n g e d as y o u might think. T h e
purpose of university is to have your mind
trained. It's never been any different since
Socrates a n d it doesn't m u c h matter what
you get it trained in. S o m e of o u r graduates
are managers of Marks a n d Spencers, on
the other hand, you've got people doing
g o o d engineering with Arts degrees. If y o u
get your mind trained it doesn't really
matter what it's trained in so long as it's
versatile. You've got to c o m e to university
with an open m i n d . It isn't like what i t w a s a t
school. O h m ' s L a w isn't true. You've got to
keep a n open m i n d ; you've got to discover a
new way of thinking of things every day. I'd
advise people to broaden their horizons
and, of course, discuss things amongst
themselves; this is w h a t a g r o u p o f people is
all about anyway. Y o u will get quite a lot
from each other, quite apart from the formal
lectures.
On to your position, which is Professor of
Heavy Electrical Engineering. Could you
explain that a little?
Well heavy simply means the generation of
electrical energy in quantity, in thousands
of m e g a w a t t s at a t i m e . A P r o f e s s o r
of Heavy Electrical E n g i n e e r i n g is c o n -
scious of heat engines a n d t h e r m o d y n a -
mics a n d engineering in its broadest a n d
heaviest sense.
You're famous for your work on the linear
induction motor, but has it developed as
quickly as you expected?
It might have developed more rapidly than
y o u thought. T h e thing is that people iden-
tify linear motors with high speed transport.
Well, there's a lot more to linear motors than
high speed transport. We've sold millions of
pounds worth of linear motors a year for
several years a n d listed 1,000 different a p -
plications to industry, none of w h i c h are
high speed transport. T h e big money s p i n -
ner now is a scrap sorter, sorting a l u m i n i u m
scrap from copper, brass a n d iron scrap
from stone, metal a n d c r u s h e d up motor
cars in general. That's a very big money
s p i n n e r . W e haven't really b e g u n — j u s t
s c r a t c h e d t h e s u r f a c e t h a t ' s a l l . E v e r y
generation thinks it's got there but it hasn't.
/ remember you saying once, on Multi-
coloured Swap Shop in fact, "Never mind if
you don't understand the theory, just have a
go at using it."
M a k i n g it useful is what engineering is all
about
What do you think of pure science?
Pure science is a luxury a n d always has
been, full stop. There's those w h o think
a b o u t t h e o r i g i n o f t h e Universe and may be
so m i s g u i d e d — b e c a u s e it may never have
had one! It pre-supposes it had one. Extra-
polation is not valid. Y o u c a n see that the
earth had a beginning a n d how it might
have an e n d , we know all of us might have a
b e g i n n i n g a n d a n e n d . Y o u c a n t e x -
trapolate a n d say the universe h a d a begin-
ning a n d an end, it might not have.
Eric Laithwaite is Professor ofHeauy Electrical
Engineering at Imperial College. He is undoubt-
edly the father of the linear induction motor in
its modern form and is well-known for demon-
strating the unusual properties of gyroscopes.
Is this your personal philosophy?
I'd call it c o m m o n s e n s e !
When you are dealing with your engineer-
ing, is it the application and experiment.
E x p e r i m e n t is a/ways right, t h e t h e o r y
never! Experiment rules.
On Monday you will be giving the
inaugural lecture for the H.G. Wells
Society, of which you are President. Have
you any surprises in store for us?
O h yes. T h i n g s that I h o p e p e o p l e will say
" W h y didn't y o u teach us that at s c h o o l ? "
I've lectured the society before o n four or
five occasions. In its greater days the first
time I gave one I was told h o w fortunate I
was to be asked to lecture to the society!
There are those today w h o kindly say h o w
f o r t u n a t e t h e y a r e f o r m e to d o t h e i r
lectures—neither is correct I hasten to a d d .
We are fellow students in a c o m m o n cause.
I never want to be any different.
I understand that the point of the society is
to celebrate the life and works of H.G.
Wells and to pursue matters that Wells
might have been interested in. Is there
anything that you particularly would like
done by the society?
Yes, I think they ought not to be afraid of
dabbling in s u c h things as E S P . A friend
and colleague of mine w h o is my counter-
part at City University is A r t h u r Ellison a n d
he is President for the society of p s y c h i c
r e s e a r c h . T h e s o c i e t y m u s t get A r t h u r
along to do a talk o n E S P . (Ed's note:
Arthur Ellison will be lecturing a week.on
Monday (unknown at the time ol the
interview).)
And finally, what about Professor Laith-
waite? Will you ever retire?
I never want to retire. A n y o n e w h o is a true
a c a d e m i c w i l l n e v e r r e t i r e — h e s t o p s
thinking. I want to do a B a r n e s W a l l a c e
designing continental airliners into m y
nineties.
Thank you very much Professor Laithwaite.
