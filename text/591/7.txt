Consoc
At present Britain is suffering at the hands of
an unfortunate world recession. We are not
the only c o u n t r y to be affected and the
Government is insisting on stern measures in
order to try and half the decay of British
industry, and to force the country to become
economically viable again.
The Conservative Party now has several
political opponents, however none of these
offer a feasible solution to the recession. They
are, without exception, a very poor alternative
to conservatism.
A t I m p e r i a l , we t r y to f o r w a r d the
conservative viewpoint, to individuals and at
Union meetings. If you are interested in joining
the Conservative Society please come to our
Wine and Cheese Party on Monday October
12 at 6:30pm in Mech E n g 702. P e t e r
Brooke, MP will be there to speak and he is
always willing to answer any* questions.
CND
O n Thursday, October 15, at 1:00pm Tony
Allan from the national C N D office will be in
the Upper Lounge to lead a discussion. This
will be an opportunity for all of those people in
College interested in disarmament to come
together and find out more about some of the
issues and arguments involved. This is not just
an introductory meeting for those new to
College—everyone is welcome to come along,
however unconvinced you may be.
What we also need is people who are willing
to spend a little time each week helping to run
the group and promote C N D . Those who were
active last year are especially asked to be
there—the campaign can only succeed if more
and more people take a hand.
Chaplaincy
Y o u may well have come across a Chaplaincy
member visiting you in your Hall or House, or
have seen the Chaplaincy Newsletter Chi-Rho,
the purpose of which is to welcome you to
Imperial College and to invite you to come
along to our H a l l , H o u s e or department
groups.
T h e aim of these groups is to enable
students to meet socially and to discuss topics
which they might otherwise be unable to do in
College. Information about where and when
these meetings are held will be displayed on
p o s t e r s in the r e l e v a n t H a l l , H o u s e or
department.
The West London Chaplaincy also holds
services every Sunday; this takes place in the
Sherfield Refectory's Ante-Room, at 10:00am.
This is a communion service with an informal

backgrounds are welcome.

CONSTITUENT COLLEGE UNIONS*
Well, I hope you are all surviving the first week
of term—mind you it's not over yet!
Assuming you are not too battered and
bruised (or even if you are) after our ice-
skating trip on Tuesday, we'll see you tonight
at the Rugby Club Party in the J C R .
However, don't get too drunk 'cause you're
c o m i n g T I D D L Y W I N K I N G d o w n O x f o r d
Street tomorrow. W e are meeting at R S M at
9:30am on Saturday morning.
In order to lubricate your exhausted body in
the e v e n i n g , the R S M P u b C r a w l — the
highlightweek!—is taking place—meeting in
the Union Bar between 6:00 and 6:15pm.
City & Guilds
Security
D u r i n g the next few months a number of
you will call at r o o m 150 Sherfield to report
items stolen, in particular cycles, wallets and
purses.
T h e university is the target of a number of
persons who live by stealing and who will
r o a m the buildings seeking the opportunity
to do so. They are very plausible and k n o w
their way around.
If you leave your coats o n the backs of
chairs with wallets in them your wallets
W I L L be stolen, if you ladies leave purses
and handbags on chairs or in drawers they
W I L L be stolen.
N e v e r carry more c a s h than you need.
K e e p cheque books and cards separate and
in a safe place.
C y c l e thieves are expert (two caught last
term admitted over 100 thefts) and stolen
cycles are big business.
N o chain is good enough but if you do use
one get a stout padlock. O n l y the metal loop
lock has so far been successful.
There is a thief a b o u t — y o u c a n bet on it.
G.R.R. Reeves
Chief Security Officer
(Possibly the best lock is called 'the
Citadel', a loop-type lock in three sizes (£17,
£23 and £27) which includes £100 insurance
if your bike should be slolen-this has never
been claimed, the manufacturers say-Ed.)
Just a short note: We've a barnight tonight in
the Union Bar starting at 6:00pm. Saturday is
Tiddlywinks Day, meet at 9:30am in the Guilds
Office. Freshers' Dinners start on Monday: if
you're in Aero and haven't got your ticket yet,
then get them this morning or it'll be too late.
Other dinners follow in rapid succession, so
get your tickets from the Guilds Office or Dep
Reps.
D o n ' t forget the elections: P u b C r a w l
organised by V P candidates on Wednesday
and the election U G M in ME220 the following
Tuesday.
All the details in Guildsheet.
