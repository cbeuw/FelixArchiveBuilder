Rent Reduction
(.(U)hmu(l jiiuii front ftftge
for Residents?
T h e o r i g i n s o f ibis a r t i c l e stem from the d i s a p p o i n t m e n t o f a
considerable number of Montepelier residents ;\t the state of their
" h o m e " and "place ol study" for at least the coming academic year.
However it is considered that ihe condition of this H a l l of Residence
aifords mention if only lo bring to the attention ol non-MontpClicr
residents the condition which the occupants arc basing to endure.
As reported in the previous editon of F E L I X the H a l l is designed to
house 84 postgraduate students, mostly in single rooms, although
accommodation for married couples is also provided. T h e Hall is very
convenient for College and also for various shopping needs.
The single rooms in the Halls are. on the whole, very small. In a
number of cases desks have, as yet, not been provided and no specific
date has been given as to when they can be expected. Indeed, in certain
instances it seems very difficult to i m a g i n e h o w desks w i l l be
accommodated within the rooms as space is extremely limited. In lact
the space limitation has prompted a number ol the residents lo start
referring to their rooms as "pigeonholes".
Although the lights work in all the rooms none of them have any
electricity sockets so that equipment such as bills, lamps, etc., cannot
be used.
The heating in the rooms is also ot a defunct nature, in that although
various reports ol the Iced pipes warming slightly have been received,
no actual eases of warm radiators have been known.
Since Montpclicr Street is a self-catering hall, kitchens are provided
so that residents may prepare their own food. However, this seemingly
simple operation bad been hindered by a lew minor setbacks such as
the absence ol a gas supply for the cookers. However, when the supply
is restored the idea ol twenty people having to share two cookers does
not seem very inviting. Electric kettles have as yet not materialised so
that the preparation of hot thinks has became exceedingly difficult.
Residents were informed that there would be laundry facilities in the
basement, but these have not vet been provided. A common room was
also anticipated, bin this has not been completed either. Until recently
some ol the toilets and bathrooms were devoid ol doors causing an
understandable degree ol "discomfort" to users of these facilities. These
have now been provided.
The geographical location ol the H a l l (just oil Brompton R d ) and
about a minutes walk from Harrods adds to the prestige ol the Hall and
p r e s u m a b l y the rent. This /J23pw. i n other words ( l o r a l l its
deficiencies) is more expensive than the Southside Halls.
The residents of the Hall are a very friendly group of people and in
all fairness it must be said that when the renovation ol the Hall is
finally completed it will be a most enjoyable place to reside. However,
this stage ol completion is nol anticipated in the immediate future.
l'lie H a l l , although as yet nameless, has attracted a varied selection
ol nicknames ol which the most popular is " T h e T i t a n i c " . Although il
surely gives the residents no pleasure to use ibis name, il does seem to
sum up the leeling of discontent about the slate of ibis H a l l ol
Residence.
It is realised that the H a l l has just recently been acquired by
Imperial College and so teething problems were inevitable and indeed
anticipated. However, there is a strong leeling among certain residents
thai I he rent ol j£23pw is too high for the services being provided al
present. M a n y leel that a reduction in the rent until a l least ibe lime
when the Hall is hilly renovated would be appropriate.
