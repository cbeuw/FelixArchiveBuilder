What's On
I hope you all had a good first week at College,
especially the freshers. Life will soon return to
normal, so don't worry.
Boanerges
The theft of four brass lamps from Bo, the
m i torised mascot of City and Guilds Union, is
a sad and extremely tragic loss. If anyone does
know anything about the incident then please
come forward and contact Andy Rushton,
Guilds President, on 589-5111 ext 1044 or
internal 2378. These items are not replaceable
and Guilds are only concerned for their safe
return.
The Name Game continues
Although I've been living in Southside since
July I'm still not quite sure what to call the Hall
I live in. Being under the impression that
Tizard and Selkirk Halls were combined at the
end of the last session, I toyed with "Tizkirk"
or "Selard" for a while. However, Warden
Henry Hutchinson informs me that the two
Halls will be deliberately kept separate and
have individual social lives and Hall com-
mittees, etc. This, of course, means that we
Selkirk residents may continue to sneer at
those awful Tizard people through the locked
inter-connecting door (surely a fire-risk!).
Looking down, on the other hand, (as we
Selkirkians often do) to the lower half of
S o u t h s i d e , 1 see that the W a r d e n has
completely integrated the two Halls, and will
hence re-name it "Faleogh" and "Kenmouth"
very shortly. How confusing!
Halls of Hall Hall
I received a few interesting names for the new
r e s i d e n c e in M o n t p e l i e r S t r e e t . It was
suggested that Hall Hall w o u l d only be
appropriate if Beit Warden, Chris Halls, was
appointed as numero uno in the Knightsbridge
domicile. Horticultural Hall was a tribute to
our own dear Rector, as (presumably) was
Toad Hall. Full marks for confusion value
goest to Albert Hall and the only serious
suggestion was Wells Hall (an excellent choice
in my opinion).
Mind you, considering the current state of
the building (with a definite lack of electrical
power causing annoyance) perhaps we should
call it Bugger 'all!

Those of you who managed to get hold of a
copy of the last F E L I X of the summer term
may remember that, as usual, I set four prize
puzzles together with a handful of 'quickies'.
N o w a l t h o u g h (or possibly because) the
summer break is so long, I received N O T A
S I N G L E E N T R Y to any of the prize puzzles.
Since the response to the Christmas and
Easter competitions was so good, I feel sure
that the main reason for the absence of entries
was that many regular solvers didn't get a copy
of the summer F E L I X . (You may recall we
had certain distibution problems when four
thousand copies of F E L I X were stolen.)
Anyway, whyever it was, I had put a hell of a
lot of work into setting those puzzles, and 1
don't see why I should give the answers away
without somebody doing some work on them;
so unless I receive any strong complaints from
w o u l d - b e s o l v e r s w h o h a v e s u f f e r e d an
agonising summer of frustration waiting for the
solutions, I shall reset the four prize puzzles as
ordinary weekly puzzles throughout the term.
Quickie Solutions
Here are the sol-
utions to the non-
prize puzzles from
the summer F E L I X ,
and also last week's
quickie.

A solution to the domino problem is shown
in the diagram.
9 and 9 have the property that their sum is
the same as their product, but with the digits
reversed.
The words liquefy, rarefy, putrefy, stupefy,
l i q u e f a c t i o n , r a r e f a c t i o n , p u t r e f a c t i o n ,
stupefaction, iridescent, inoculation, mars
(=disfigures), consensus, loth (=unwilling) and
supersede are all spelt correctly. To his credit
and s u r p r i s e , M a r k S m i t h was the only
m e m b e r of the F E L I X staff w h o k n e w
(guessed) this.
Of the poker hands, hand (d) is the best,
hand (a) the worst, and hands (b) and (e) are
equal in strength. If the hands could occur
during the same deal, then of course (a) would
be best. But as the hands cannot occur on the
same deal, their values must be based on their
probabilities of winning. Each of the full houses
can be beaten by the same number of fours of
a kind, but by different numbers of straight
flushes, (a) can be beaten by 32 straight
flushes, (d) can only be beaten by 24, and the
others by various numbers in between. This
accounts for the paradox.
A t face v a l u e , (x-a)(x b ) . . . ( x - z ) , w h e n
expanded as a polynomial has 2 2 6
terms. But a
moment's reflection shows that the twenty-
fourth factor is (x-x), and so the expression is
identically zero.
This Week's Offering
N o prize puzzle this week, but if anyone
sends me a set of solutions to the following few
quickies, I'll buy them a pint if I see them in the
bar. A l ! the solutions are well-known English
words. ' Y ' is to be regarded as a consonant.
1. W h a t single-syllable w o r d has eight
letters?
2. What six letter word contains no vowels?
3. What word contains five consecutive
vowels?
4. What word begins with seven consecutive
consonants and ends with nine?
Finally, may I remind you that there's still
time to enter both Monday's puzzle, and the
competition puzzle in the handbook. G o o d
luck!
