Secrets of the S.S
A guide to
Student Services
Most people will probably be aware by now
of the newly established Student Services
Office at 15 Princes Gardens. For those
who have s o m e h o w p a s s e d us by or
haven't yet realised the full range of
facilities available, here is a breakdown of
what we cover:
College Accommodation
Application and billing for all the College
a c c o m m o d a t i o n allocated to students
begins with us, including a limited number
of flats for families.
Private Sector Accommodation
We have details of many types of accom-
modation currently available. Most of
these are in West London, some are close
to College, while we occassionally get
oddities like an attic on the Isle of Dogs or
a yacht in St. Catherine's Dock. If you feel
in need of a change of abode during the
year, come along often enough and just
what you are looking for may turn up. If not
our A c c o m m o d a t i o n G u i d e lists some
agencies that have proved helpful in the
past. It also contains information on some
of the legal aspects of being a tenant.
Which brings me on to
Legal Advice
This includes all kinds of legal problems
from traffic offences to making claims
under the small claims procedure in the
county court.
In certain cases where you may have to
have a solicitor, as for example, you would
if you wanted someone to represent you in
a magistrates court, we have lists of
solicitors who do legal aid work—which is
free if y o u r i n c o m e is low e n o u g h —
together with the areas of the law that they
s p e c i a l i s e in. T h e s e lists a l s o note
solicitors who speak languages other than
English.
Landlord Problems
These can be many and varied. One of the
problems is knowing just what your rights
are. Other problems, such as an imminent
breakdown in the relationship between
tenant and l a n d l o r d , may be helped
through an intermediary such as our-
selves.
Consumer Rights
Legislation over the last few years has
given the consumer considerable pro-
tection. However, it is still up to the
individual to find out how he stands in any
transaction that appears to have gone
wrong, and summon up enough energy to
commence battlelThis is where we can
provide reinforcements with advice and
s o m e t i m e s direct intervention when
appropriate.
Immigration/Home Office Problems
This is an area which may require the skills
of specialist organisations or solicitors
which we can put you in touch with,
although for routine enquiries we should
be able to provide most of the answers.
Insurance
We have quite a selection of leaflets on
m a n y t y p e s of i n s u r a n c e , i n c l u d i n g
b i c y c l e s , p e r s o n a l , p o s s e s s i o n s and
holidays.
Covenants
Here is a useful way of supplementing your
income by reclaiming tax paid by your
parents on their contribution to your grant.
F o r m s e x p l a i n i n g the p r o c e d u r e are
available from Student Services.
Benefits
We have most of the relevant Department
of Health and Social Security leaflets, such
as those on all aspects of the N H S
(including medical treatment abroad),
National Insurance contributions, unem-
ployment benefit and rent a l l o w a n c e
schemes.
Grants
Help with chasing up recalcitrant LEAs.
advice on eligibility for grants, details of
certain discretionary allowances and lists
of educational charities can be provided
Miscellaneous
This includes such things as reference
books on holiday jobs and w o r k i n g
holidays, while we also aim to act as
intermediaries between those looking for
tutoring work and those in need of
tutoring.

EXEC VIEWS
I am sure that the first years amongst you were a little overawed by the
Freshers' Reception on Monday. Y o u probably also found Freshers' Fair
really hectic and how about those first lectures? Because of all that goes
on in the first week of term and as a reminder for second and third years I
shall go over the impression we were trying to create at the Reception.
The people in this Union Office are really quite human and very keen
to help you. The three sabbatical officers are all students who went
through the same processing and settling in when they first came to
College. The three permanent staff in the office, J e n , J o and Pat, are
charming and knowledgable. Please feel at home in this office and come
up here if you have any problems or queries.
W e should be able to advise on any College related problem (and a few
outside College). If you are having difficulties with your course and want
help come and see us. If you want to complain about a member of staff or
warden or any College employee come and see us. Similarly if you want
to complain about a service offered by College come and see us. If you
want to complain about a Union Officer come and see me. A n d if you
want to complain about me, go and see Barney. Of course if you have
anything pleasant to tell us we want to hear that too.
The Union has officers to help with academic affairs, welfare, Rag and
all the clubs and societies. Make use of them, they all promised so much
when they stood for election.
A s far as Barney, Marco and myself are concerned, grab us in the office,
in our rooms (we all live in College residence) or in the street. I suppose I
had better add what all Presidents say, you can sometimes catch us in the
bar.
So have a good year at IC. Work hard but enjoy yourselves.
