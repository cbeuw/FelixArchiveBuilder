Raise "The Titanic"!
FELIX has received several complaints about the state
of the new Hall in Montpelier Street. We sent a reporter
along to give an impression of the current situation in the
building, and to assess whether it deserves the newly
acquired nickname "The Titanic". Report on page 3.
UGM Report
A n interest ins;, c o n t r o v e r s i a l
U G M , thrilled by the cut and
thrust of debate, moved by our
leaders' oratory, and quorate lo
the end. was too much to hope lor.
In l a d , the meeting opened
c p i q r a t e , but l a t e w i t h M r
Goulder tediously describing the
standing orders for the benefit of
anybody present unable to read.
He was followed by M r M o r t o n ,
wielding a plastic cutlass, who
had the meeting stand up or sit
down according to departments,
shoe size, and place of birth in an
attempt to bring borne to the
m e e t i n g l y h e severity of the
education cuts lacing this, and
other, universities.
M r McCain.' had a rougher
lime, vainly attempting to justify
the s u b s t i t u t i o n of a me I a 1
cupboard lor the Union's masc ot.
M i k e : and trying to convince us
t h a t the p a r t i t i o n r e c e n t l y
erected in the Lower Lounge was
worth the money.
Following very similar C C U
reports, and a couple ol com-
mcndably short reports from M r
Ledwold, the I T . U President.
M a r t i n Y o u n g , was introduced.
E v e n t u a l l y we r e a c h e d the
motions: Discussion on the fust

as was rumoured because bis
speech was in danger ol being
boring, but because everybody
agreed with it. M r M o r t o n ihen
reminded us ol the expedition to
Salford on October 17 lo mat' li
against I lu- cuts.
The second, and linal. motion
was on Iranian students, and the
troubles in Iran, which, with the
exception ol 3 clauses alleging
police hanassment. was quickly
passed.
The meeting adjourned as all
the keen first years sped oil to
lectures, (caving the Chairman's
nose for discussion at the next
I C M . when " W i n n i e the P o o h '
Aaionovitc h. President til N T ' S ,
will be- present.
S T O P P R E S S : There are still places in
