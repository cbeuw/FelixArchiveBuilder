SIR KEITH POINTS THE WAY
On Thursday, Sir Keith Joseph, the Minister for
Industry, came to Imperial to speak as a guest of the
IC Conservative Society. 400 students packed Mech Eng
220 and Mark Clegg, the Consoc Chairman, was
extremely pleased with the way people behaved and also
thought that Sir Keith spoke well at the meeting. Sir Keith
chose the theme, 'The Basic Choice.'

Wham, bam,
thankyou ma'am!
LAST SATURDAY, at 9:30, when most students were in bed,
and hours before IC Radio was due to go on the air, the ears
