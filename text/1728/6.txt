A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with the Union President, Abhijay Sood, to talk about his first weeks on the job, his plans
for the year, and his role as student representative.
Felix: How were your
first weeks on the
job?
APS: It felt like we were
starting over and over
again. Initially we came in
on July 15th for handover
with our predecessors,
and that was a start. Then
they left around August
1st, and that was a start.
But the training sessions
and residential only
finished on August 9th, so
I suppose that was the real
start; we’ve only settled in
more recently.
Felix: What have you
been up to recently?
APS: So far, the major
things I’ve been involved
in have been preparation
for Welcome, helping
select the new Dean for
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences, acting as a
student rep in various
meetings, and “fire-
fighting” for the Union
whenever something
urgent comes up.
In terms of welcome, I
was fortunate enough to
be able to give introduc-
tory speeches to all the
new first year undergrads,
as well as separate talks
on Saturday alongside
Shervin [Sabeghi,
the Deputy President
(Welfare)] for those living
outside halls and taught
master’s students.
About the Dean, two
weeks ago, the Provost
asked me to provide a list
of student representatives
to be involved in the re-
cruitment process: under-
graduates and postgrad-
uates from across natural
sciences. These students
and I met the shortlisted
candidates, some internal
and external, for “con-
versational interviews,”
and passed our comments
back to the Provost
ahead of this week’s final
inteview panels.
Felix: What are your
main plans for the
year?
APS: We’ve got a lot of
big stuff coming up this
year. This term, the Union
will be entering into nego-
tiations with the College
regarding the price of rent
in halls. Once we have a
clear timeline for these
negotiations, we’ll be
bringing options asking
Union Council how to
proceed.
Union Council is the
union’s decision-making
body, made up of elected
student representatives.
Abhijay noted that the
meetings are public, and
implored students to
attend.
APS: Everyone should
come along and make their
voice heard, and have a
say in the decisions being
made on their behalf.
APS: In terms of other big
stuff, Fifi [Henry, Deputy
President (Finance &
Services)] and I will be
renegotiating for the
block grant we receive
from College, which
makes up around 70% of
our budget. We’ll also be
writing a new three-year
strategy, a very boring
name for something
important – deciding
what we want to do next
and where we want to
be in 3 years’ time. The
process around this will
be led by myself and the
managing director of the
Union, Jarlath O’Hara.
All of these things happen
once every few years,
and each has coincided
this year. Getting through
these things, as well as my
manifesto points, will take
most of my year.
