Behind Every Man... The Seven Ages of
Patience:
A Community Play
F
ew of us, or at
least not myself,
have sat back
and wondered
what a day in the life of
Melania Trump would
be like. Having said that,
perhaps a few of us have
pondered in fascination
over the inner workings
of Mrs. Trump’s mind,
and the implications and
consequences of being
married to a President of
the United States, not to
mention the implications
and consequences of being
married to Donald Trump.
Two Ladies, written by
Nancy Harris, gives us an
insight into the world of
the WAGs of politics.
Our story is unsur-
prisingly narrated by two
ladies: Helen, played by
the wonderful Zoë Wan-
amaker, is largely based
on Brigitte Macron, and
Sophia, played by Zrinka
Cvitešić, resembles
Melania Trump in life
and in character. Although
there is no mention of
either Trump or Macron,
Harris leaves very little
to the imagination as to
where her inspiration
of characters may have
emerged, with Helen
being a 66-year-old
teacher whose husband
is 20 years her junior and
Sophia, an ex-fashion
model from the Balkans.
We meet Helen waiting
in an empty hotel con-
ference room in France,
our home for the night,
as she anxiously waits
for her husband to finish
a meeting down the hall
where he and other world
leaders are discussing
impending military
action. Much to Helen’s
dismay, she is joined
rather abruptly by Sophia,
who has been recently
doused with animal blood
by a protestor. The two
are forced by their staff
to remain alone together
until the summit and asso-
ciated protests conclude.
This compulsory rendez-
vous births the following
90 minutes as the pair
discuss their resented
roles of wives of presi-
dents; secrets are shared,
and bonds are made.
The pair provide con-
trasting commentary on
types of female power,
although both accounts
highlight the vast amount
of progress yet to be made
in the realm of gender
equality. Helen tells of
the sacrifices that she
has made in order for her
husband to be President,
the limits to her career, and
also of the vast amounts
of unpaid work that her
life now involves. It is
also revealed, with raised
eyebrows, that Helen is
her husband’s unofficial,
and unacknowledged,
advisor, with many of his
best ideas actually being
hers. At the other end of
the room, Sophia speaks of
using her physical beauty
as her secret weapon, both
in her past life in Croatia
and her current life as
First Lady of the United
States. She tells of being
repeatedly undermined
yet is surprisingly aware
of how others perceive
her. As the play builds to
a close, tensions rise to
boiling point, the ladies
encouraging one another
of the life that should and
could be.
Luckily for midweek
viewers, you do not
need to attend with fully
engaged brains as Harris
very helpfully spells
almost everything out
for her audience with a
slightly clunky dialogue.
The play is brought to life
by superb acting on behalf
of both Wanamaker and
Cvitešić, who make the
unimaginative characters
real and accessible. It
was a good reminder of
current issues around
gender politics, however
I left with no new ideas,
only an appreciation of
the fabulous cast.
I
n a moment where the
tensions in our coun-
try are running high,
where neighbours
and friends are divided
along political lines, and
where it feels as though a
great cloud of apathy has
settled over the United
Kingdom, Chinonyerem
Odimba’s ‘The SevenAges
of Patience’ is a breath
of fresh air. It chronicles
the life of a woman
named Patience whose
experiences are rendered
on stage against the
backdrop of the London
Borough of Brent. Its rich
narrative, looking back
over Patience’s life from
1945 to the present day,
spans the topics of racism,
feminism, gentrification,
austerity and the impor-
tance of community.
The play opens with
a white coffin. A young
black woman explains
that this is her coffin, her
story, and that her name
is Patience. The young
Patience is replaced on
stage by a plethora of
joyful mourners, people
from the important
chapters of her life. The
cast, consisting of over
one hundred non-profes-
sional actors and volun-
teers from Brent and the
local area, each appear
on the stage to share their
memories of Patience, and
in doing so reveal pieces
of Brent’s history. The
local cast are exciting to
watch, brimming with
fizz, crackle and chemis-
try, and they bring a warm
energy and authenticity
to the play which is
amplified by the audience,
many of whom have come
to see a friend or loved
one on stage. Each of the
four actresses who depict
Patience’s life from young
to old has an inviting
presence and Imperial
DramSoc alumni Tom
Cunningham also shines
in his role as Richard the
Forrester.
The Seven Ages of
Patience is a love letter to
Brent, a ‘place of Turkish
restaurants, African hair-
Road you can dance ‘to
the tune of the Irish fiddle,
or the sweetness of the
steel drum’. Odimba’s
astute script is fresh,
witty and often moving: it
does not pull its punches
when remarking on the
abundance of ‘lattes and
estate agents’ on the High
Road, but also pays testa-
ment to the harsh realities
of racism, austerity and
violence.
In one particularly af-
fecting moment, a young
Patience bids goodbye to
the spirit of her mother,
killed in a bombing during
the second world war. Her
mother says that she must
learn to ‘take her sadness
and make it something
beautiful in the world’:
a mantra which Patience
repeats at moments of
great darkness in her life.
These range from racism
directed towards her and
her colleagues while
working as a midwife,
to the moment Stephen
Lawrence is killed in
1993. It is a mantra which
Patience leaves as her
legacy in the community
of Brent. And during the
play’s closing song ‘We
Are Brent’, the sense of
community in the Kiln
theatre couldn’t have been
stronger.
