Investing in Ukrainian debt – a remarkable opportunity
in the negative-yield debt environment
annual growth in 2020
(see Figure 1) .
Russia’s forecast stays
at 1.8% for the same time
period, in comparison.
Furthermore, Ukraine’s
debt to GDP ratio is now
almost a quarter less than
it was three years ago (see
Figure 1. Projected GDP growth in Ukraine // World Bank
Figure 2. Debt-to-GDP ratio // Ministry of Finance, Ukranie
Figure 3. Debt-to-GDP ratio // State Statistics Service, Ukranie
Figure 2), which signifi-
cantly decreasing proba-
bility of a partial default in
case of any abrupt market
volatility.
Another crucial pa-
rameter to consider is the
stability of the national
currency – Hryvna.
After several years of
super-high inflation that
has occurred primarily
as a result of a civil war
in the Eastern part of the
country (see Figure 3), it
has eventually stabilised
at about 9%, and there
are no significant reasons
observed for its rapid
increase on the nearest
time horizon.
However, inflation is
just one piece that con-
tributes to the currency’s
stability. It is also impor-
tant to see how hryvna
has been valued against
other world currencies.
In other words, how has
the exchange rate of the
hryvna with other curren-
cies changed in the recent
past.
Let’s have a detailed
look into the two most
widely used “reference
points” – euro and US
dollar.
Talking about dollar
in the first place, hryvna
has managed to achieve a
relatively huge growth of
4.6% in the past month.
This is an even a greater
achievement, given
how strongly the dollar
is valued nowadays. In
the meantime, hryvna’s
positions against euro
has strengthened as well,
and is expected to rise
even more as a result of
new round of quantitative
easing that was announced
recently (see Figure 4 &
5).
Lastly, for every
emerging economy the
relationships that the
countries’ leaders build
with the International
Monetary Fund and the
World Bank are crucial,
as their budgets usually
directly depend on credits

received from those
organisations. Here it is
probably best to quote
the words of the World
Bank’s President, David
Malpass. In his recent
article in the Financial
Times, titled “Ukraine is
ready to seize its chance
to reform”, David writes
“The World Bank is deter-
mined to provide support
during this critical journey
toward a freer, stronger
Ukraine.” – if that isn’t
powerful what else is?
Even if those arguments
are already convincing for
you, do not rush with the
decision - the emerging
markets can sometimes be
extremely volatile (which
we have recently seen in
Argentina and Turkey, for
example).
Therefore, it is always
important to bear in mind
any of the associated
risks. First of all, we still
don’t know who Zelensky
really is as a President,
and what is his live action
plan. Indeed, there has
been a lot of talk about a
need for industrial devel-
opment and elimination
of corruption, but for now
it is still more words than
action. Secondly, there
is still on-going war in
Eastern Ukraine, and
although both sides are
currently in the state of
temporary (and honestly,
very shaky) peace, the
conflict can flame in a
matter of weeks, thus
largely affecting the po-
tentially stable economic
outlook of Ukraine.
To conclude, the
overall investment land-
scape looks encouraging
now, but follow the en-
vironment carefully after
investing – it can substan-
tially change shape any
time.
