S
ince the election of
Jeremy Corbyn to
the Labour Party
leadership in 2015,
the party’s policy platform
took a sharp turn away
from the centrist New
Labour years and back
towards the party’s left-
wing roots. Promising an
end to the harsh austerity
policies imposed by the
Conservative – Lib Dem
coalition government that
has killed an estimated
130,000 people, and a
return to the democratic
socialist and trade union-
ist politics the party was
founded on, “Corbynism”
offered renewed hope to
millions of people; lead-
ing to the biggest increase
in the party’s vote share
since 1945 in the 2017
General Election.
However, during
my time at this year’s
Conference in Brighton,
I witnessed a new surge
of bold, vibrant policies
being pushed by the
grassroots membership.
Some people have
started to call it “Corby-
nism without Corbyn”,
or “Corbynism 2.0”.
But what exactly does it
entail?
The boldest and most
transformative policy to
pass through the votes
on the conference floor
was the Green New
Deal motion: a plan to
tackle climate change by
pushing for mass public
investment in renewa-
ble energy, aiming for
free public transport
and public ownership
of our energy grid,
and green, unionised
jobs for all who want
them. Alongside these
proposals, a target for
net-zero carbon emis-
sions by 2030 was set
by the motion, a target
that is in line with the
scientific community’s
analysis of the urgency
of action, as specified
in the landmark IPCC
report.
The motion getting
through was a massive
success for one of
the newest grassroots
campaigns in the Party:
Labour for a Green
New Deal. I remember
their volunteers, in their
green tshirts, huddled
around at conference,
busy coordinating
rallies, protests, and
much more. Earlier
this year, the group
held events across the
country, including one
with the Labour Society
at Imperial, as part of
their campaign launch.
It felt wonderful to have
played a small part in
the campaign, especially
when I received the
news that the motion
had passed and become
Labour Party policy.
Other policies passed
at conference included a
migrants’ rights motion
that included the main-
tenance and extension
of free movement for
all, the end of NHS
restrictions, extension
of voting rights to all
UK residents and the
closure of detention
centres. Another policy
committed Labour to
working towards a 4 day
work week with no loss
of pay (we could all do
with 3 day weekends!),
with another committing
to the integration of
private schooling into
the public sector, ending
class segregation in our
society. These policies
were not written by
the leadership, but
actively pushed for by
Labour’s 500,000 strong
grassroots member-
ship. With a left-wing
leader, members feel
empowered to utilise all
the party’s democratic
mechanisms to mould
it into a party that is by,
and for, the people.
Exciting policies
weren’t the only things
going on at Labour party
conference. On my first
evening in Brighton,
after having met fellow
young activists that I
had connected to via
Twitter, we went along
to an event organised by
Young Labour on ‘The
Left in Power’. A panel
event featuring Unite
General Secretary Len
McCluskey, socialist
intellectual Leo Panitch,
Labour candidate Chris
Peace, Young Democrat-
ic Socialist of America
Chair Kristen Cervero,
and Bernie 2020 cam-
paigner Christian Bowe,
it was a favourable, yet
critical, look at the dem-
ocratic socialist move-
ments both in the UK
and the US, with Panitch
order to bring about real,
transformative change
to their countries. The
event had free food and
drink and was organised
by the Young Labour
committee; special shout
out to them for all their
excellent volunteered
work!
Other events through-
out conference included
a panel with ‘Show
Racism the Red Card’,
featuring excellent
Labour MPs such as
David Lammy, Laura
Pidcock, and my own
MP, Tan Dhesi. Tan
spoke candidly about
the moment he spoke
truth to power and
called out Boris John-
son’s dangerous rhetoric
around Muslim women
– language that saw a
spike in hate crimes
aimed at Muslim women
in the following weeks.
These days, we cannot
have a politics article
without a mention of the
main thing on the agenda
right now: Brexit. We
went in to the confer-
ence expecting the party
to take a pro-remain
position given the fact
that most of the party
members were pro-re-
main. In the end two
motions were proposed:
one for the party to
campaign for remain
in a second referendum
against their own nego-
tiated Brexit deal, and
another for the party to
remain neutral until a
second, special one-day
conference when the
deal has been secured, to
decide whether to back
remain or the deal. The
latter won the vote.
Personally, I think the
neutral position makes a
lot of sense. Why would
we say we will negotiate
a Brexit deal and then
campaign against our
own negotiated deal?
There is a lot of divisive
Brexit extremism going
on in politics right now:
the Lib Dems want to
undemocratically cancel
Brexit without a second
referendum, and the
Tories want to undem-
ocratically force us to
leave with a disastrous
no deal with no mandate.
A neutral position going
into a General Election
will mean that Labour
can focus on its bold
economic and environ-
mental proposals and
leave the question of
Brexit to the people.
After all, Labour is not
for the 52% or the 48%,
but the 99%.
I came away from
Labour conference
hopeful for a better
future, and confident
that this was a govern-
ment-in-waiting that can
fight for the interests
of the many. Labour is
back to its roots and it is
us members leading the
way for a bold policy
platform. After all, it is
only a party by the many
that can claim to speak
for the many.
