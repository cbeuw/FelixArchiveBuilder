Meet the Editors: Syon - the callipygian one
I
was already a prolific
writer in primary
school. My first work
was an illustrated
narrative involving a
couple of aliens on the
moon kissing and pro-
ceeding to have “seks”.
My second was a series
of short stories centred
around Dophilip, a plucky
dolphin who had to nav-
igate problems such as
playground bullying and
the astronomical cost of
college textbooks – don’t
worry, a celebrity shark
happened to find out
about Dophilip’s woes
and saved the day with the
magic power of having
lots of money. What I’m
trying to say, apart from
having a desperate need
for therapy and a full
psychological work-up,
is that my talents lay in
the field of Creative Arts.
And yet I found myself at
Imperial. God has a cruel
sense of irony.
I attempted to keep
up my passion, doing
a Horizons course in
Creative Writing and
participating in National
Novel Writing Month
(NaNoWriMo) when
time (and a stockpile of
Red Bull) permitted, but
those side-hustles left
me unfulfilled. It wasn’t
until my BSc year that I
wrote my first piece for
Felix and I think it may
have been the best thing
to happen to me since I
discovered the magic of
running my hands under
a cold tap before making
shortcrust pastry. In a
misguided attempt to
impress a crush, I agreed
to accompany him to a
medical conference, the
press tickets generously
provided by Felix for
the low, low price of an
800 word review. Not
only was it the perfect
romantic venture, but it
also turned out to be the
perfect opportunity to
keep me writing while
exposing myself to new
experiences. Unfortunate-
ly, those experiences did
not involve a Pinterest
wedding with the man
of my dreams nor did it
involve any level of physi-
cally exposing myself (it’s
not harassment if it’s for
love). Recently, I heard
he’s settled down, that
when you can have free
press tickets, a constant
stream of emails to send,
and reviews to edit the shit
out of? Dying alone on a
deathbed made of Felix
papers I’ve contributed to
and edited for can also be
something to aspire to.
While my quest for
true love may continue
ad infinitum, your quest
to find reviews for the
latest London shows
and Arts-related opinion
pieces ends here. If you

for the results of your
Electro Swing and Cabaret...
I
attended the
S o u t h b a n k
Underbelly festival
this weekend to watch
the Electro Swing Project
perform a cabaret. I went
with the expectation that
I would witness a cabaret
of a quality that matched
its rather hefty ticket price
of £18.50. What I got was
the stuff of nightmares,
except that my nightmares
are better rehearsed.
One juggler dropped
more balls than a classful
of teenage boys; not one,
but two singers couldn’t
hit a note if it was the
side of a barn door, and
the ringmaster couldn’t
hold an audience if it was
nailed to their hand. Two
female dancers appeared
and disappeared on stage
at random, briefly occu-
pying the platform to per-
form aerobics or deposit
props. Both were dressed
in various outfits clearly
selected to titillate the au-
dience, but unfortunately,
both held a fixed rictus
grin that suggested they
were wondering where
their trousers had disap-
peared to.
In the advertisements
made for the show, live
music was promised.
This was provided in the
form of a saxophonist
and a drummer and the
aforementioned singers.
The saxophonist spent
the whole performance
strutting about the stage,
barely scrambling around
the licks in Glenn Miller’s
In the mood before ruin-
ing Eurythmics’ Sweet
Dreams by improvising
over the top of it. I would
forgive the probably-com-
petent drummer, except
he seemed to be enjoy-
ing himself and I wasn’t.
There was a moment
when the ringmaster and
the drummer performed
a nice call and response
with tap dancing. It was a
shining light in an other-
wise miserable attempt at
cabaret.The worst part of
the event was the misla-
belling it as electro swing.
The music, such as it was,
was mostly just remixed
pop classics with the bass
turned up too loud.
A disappointing
evening was made even
more disappointing by the
price of the food available
at the festival. £5 for oven
chips is enough even to
make a seasoned capitalist
wince and, in the end, I sat
through the indignity of
the performance hungry
and thoroughly miserable.
Frustratingly, even
though the performance
was terrible, members of
the audience seemed de-
termined to have a good
time. I had the pleasure of
watching two rhythmical-
ly challenged gentlemen
clapping alternately out of
time with the music on the
demand of the ringmaster.
An older gentleman was
so fixated on the scantily
clad aerobics class that he
probably wouldn’t have
noticed if his wife left
him. The ringmaster was
able to draw a cheer from
the crowd even when the
fire-dancer couldn’t light
his sword on fire. Human-
ity regularly disappoints
me.
I suggest going to see
this show if you are plan-
ning on having an aneu-
rysm.
