O
n Tuesday 1st
October, Im-
perial students
were moved
out of the library after
the building started to
flood with water. There
had been heavy rainfall
intermittently through-
out the day, affecting
the entire campus and
causing disruption at the
Welcome Fair.
Students in the library
at the time reported seeing
water flowing down
the walls of level one,
implying that the source
of the water was on an
upper floor. There were
also large pools of water
that made their way into
the library café, although
from on-scene discussions
it appears that the cause of
this is distinct from that of
the library flood.
Many cleaning staff
were on-scene, using
hoovers to get rid of the
water, as well as paper
towels and sandbags.
Many seemed nonplussed
at the carnage, surprised
that the heavy rainfall had
been sufficient to cause a
shutdown of the library,
and informing Felix
reporters that the carpets
upstairs were currently
being shampooed. Stu-
dents in the library café
did not appear to mind the
water – many sat down on
chairs in the midst of the
pool, forcing staff to ask
them to move in order to
clean up.
This was the first time in
several years that an event
like this has occurred –
unplanned closures of the
library are very rare.
According to an official
statement from Chris
Banks, the Assistant
Provost (Space) and Di-
rector of Library Services,
the affected areas were
the second floor and main
entrance. Neither appear
to have suffered any
long-term damage, but the
college will “continue to
monitor the situation for
any remedial works that
may be required.”
“We have already
invested heavily in
strengthening our disaster
and emergency communi-
cation plans, and will be
reviewing all actions taken
during this incident.”
No staff or students
were harmed. The library
reopened the following
morning, with all services
returning to normal oper-
ation.
