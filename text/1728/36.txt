HANGMAN
Freshers Fair marred
by extreme weather
patterns, violent
committee members,
and acne.

O
n Tuesday,
Freshers Fair
opened on
i n c l e m e n t
weather, resulting in
unfortunate setbacks for
society committee mem-
bers that were ostracised
to the great outdoors. The
downpour came as a com-
plete surprise to the Union
– understandably so,
since London has enjoyed
warm, tropical climates
for as long as Imperial has
existed. When Negafelix
asked whether the
planning committee had
bothered to look up the
weather forecast before-
hand, they started hissing
and making the cross at
us. One of the organizers
even brought out a stake,
waggling it threateningly
and condemning us to hell
for believing in witchcraft.
The weather was only
one in a long series of
hiccups for this year’s
committee. Several
members had to be forci-
bly removed from the site
for being too aggressive
with promotion tactics.
“One girl almost took my
eye out trying to give me a
free pen,” said one fresher
who visited the Felix stall.
“I was just trying to get to
the free notebook on the
table next to them, and
she shoved a registration
sheet into my face and
practically force-fed me
one of their free cookies,”
another wrote in an
anonymous complaint to
Felix, “And it wasn’t even
good!”
Following the chlorine
leak at Ethos, ChemSoc
also attempted a valiant
reenactment of events by
blowing up an experiment
and forcing a fire evacua-
tion.
overhaul the system.; the
Library Seat Club, who
provides seat-saving ser-
vices during peak exam
season for £10 an hour;
and the Righteous Sharks,
whose participants seek
out drunk freshers who
are separated from their
shoal during nights out,
and put them to bed with
a bible quote and a hot
water bottle (their slogan:
Freshers are friends, not
food).
Several commercial
companies also hosted
stalls at Sherfield Building
this year. Amongst these
were British Petroleum,
a North Korean whaling
company, the guys behind
OxyContin and University
College London.
The activities available
at these stalls involved

force feeding a pelican
petrol, harpooning a min-
iature beluga with a rock-
et-propelled grenade and
administering opioids to
a toddler. Points were de-
ducted for showing even a
modicum of humanity.
Meanwhile, at the
UCL event, people were
given dot to dot puzzles
and a colouring book.
One fresher said, “this is
my final chance to talk
to someone with social
skills and proper hygeine.
So I’m going to shout at
them and tell them their
degree’s worthless.”
Upon further inquiries, it
was made apparent that
the Fresher was a physics
student. They learn so
young.

Lots of new clubs
and societies made their
debut at the Fair this year.
Such clubs include the
Room Booking Society,
whose sole purpose is for
members to gather weekly
and spam the Room
Booking system in hopes
of crashing it and forcing
the Union to completely
