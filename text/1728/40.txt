Gliding Club Heads to France!
T
his year’s
summer gliding
tour brought us
to Issoudun, a
quaint little commune
in the heart of France.
Issoudun is the same place
where our previous glid-
ing captain Toby Freeland
achieved an amazing 6th
place in the International
championships two weeks
prior. The weather was
great for gliding, and the
temperature was incred-
ibly high reaching over
forty degrees centigrade
every day.
The first two days in
Issoudun were great and
everyone got a fantastic
amount of flying time.
Unfortunately, on Monday
evening one of the glider’s
(496) radio stopped
working. Just as we’d
found some new fuses for
the radio, the next bit of
bad luck hit us. The other
glider’s (296) starboard
aileron was damaged
while being towed back to
the trailers, it was locked
in the maximum position.
Tuesday’s wonderful
flying weather was not
monopolised on due to
repairs. By the end of the
day, we managed to free
up the aileron (although
it still required a lengthy
inspection to ensure air-
worthiness). Thank you
Donato, who found the
dodgy connection! And
thank you French techni-
cian Michel for the help!
We got the radio working
again, so 496 was good to
go!
We resumed our flying
on Wednesday full of
new enthusiasm and
some wonderful thermals
built up before a storm
hit at 6pm. On Thursday,
we even got Issoudun’s
Duo Discus out, so more
people could go flying.
What a beautiful plane!
Thankfully, the rest of
the tour was uneventful
apart from more and more
storms forming in the
evenings which did not
give us much flying time.
We enjoyed the days at
the airfield a lot though,
playing cards, practising
our French, playing
football, enjoying deli-
cious French baguettes
and enjoying nice cold
well-earned beers in the
evenings.
Although the French
did not really seem to like
us ‘British’ (Shaun was
the only British national
for most of the week)
much in the beginning, we
got along with them very
well in the end.
In spite of the big
and small incidents and
scorching days, it was a
very enjoyable week. We
managed to make the best
out of every situation,
and got a good amount of
flying in the end!
Special thanks to
Donato, Nik and Antoine
for organising this trip, to
Giorgos, Donato, Shaun,
and Nik who towed the
gliders, to everyone who
helped us fix the gliders
and to our wonderful in-
structor Shaun who came
to fly with us all week
long despite the heat.
Kabaddi Give it a Go: Sport’s Editors Impression
L
ast Wednesday
I took part in IC
Kabaddi’s Give
it a Go session.
Being honest, I didn’t
really know what I was
getting myself into. I had
the idea it was sort of a
mix of tig (I’m Scottish,
the English know it as
‘tag’or ‘it’) and wrestling/
judo. Now I can comforta-
bly say it’s like tig - if the
aim was to gang-tackle
the person doing the
‘tigging’…
It’s very quick-paced,
requiring one person
from the offensive team
to ‘raid’ the defending
team’s side of the field.
The raiding person has to
touch part of one of the
defending team’s body
(sort of like ‘tigging/
tagging’ someone). Once
this happens the defend-
ing team attempts to stop
the raider getting back
to their offensive side.
To stop the raider, the
defender grabs them and,
essentially, tosses them
to the floor. These are not
the full rules, but were the
simplified rules we played
with for the session.
Even in this introduc-
tory session, I was able
to appreciate the more
the technical side of the
game. There are different
formations, extra rules,
you can fake opponents
out (looking one way and
attempting to ‘tig’ the
other) - and the speed,
timing and synergy
(please excuse that pre-
tentious word) required
are very impressive. As
the raider moves around,
the defending team ebbs
and flows attempting to
engulf the raider; in that
sense, it is synergistic.
Kabaddi as a sport
originated from South
Asia and, according to
Wikipedia, accounts of
Kabaddi appear in the
histories of ancient India.
Additionally, it’s the
UK it is quickly growing
in popularity, with more
and more universities
forming teams. Imperial
Kabaddi in particular is
extremely successful, with
the Men’s and Women’s
teams having won five
national championships
between them.
What is perhaps most
unique is that most people
joining the club have never
played before. There there
are teams of different
skill level meaning that
it is really not at all as
intimidating as it seems.
Additionally, through the
brief interactions I had
with members, they are all
lovely. It’s a very friendly
club, and a very fun sport.
If you enjoy contact sports
and want to try something
a little different, I implore
you to try. Get in contact
