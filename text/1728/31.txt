Amazon fires were deliberately started to make
land for cattle ranching
T
he Amazon rain
forest is burning
at a record rate.
This is abso-
lutely devastating, as the
Amazon is home to 10%
of the world’s biodiver-
sity, and produces 20%
of the world’s oxygen.
Since President Jair
Bolsonaro came to office,
deforestation has hugely
accelerated, as his policies
encourage the exploitation
of the amazon rainforest.
Although there are wild-
fires in the Amazon, the
increase in wildfires this
year is now attributed to
illegal man-made fires
aimed at creating land for
cattle ranching.
The entire city of Sao
Paulo was covered with
a sky of black smoke
on Monday. The smoke
came The unprecedented
amount of fire in the
amazon, and arrived at
the Brazilian city from
more than 1,700 miles
away. Although there are
some wildfires every year
during the dry season in
the amazon, the climate
in the amazon is said to
not be too different from
the previous year. Yet, the
amount of fires this year is
the highest ever recorded,
and it is even double of the
amount recorded in 2013.
Thus, the increase in
wildfires has been attrib-
uted to increased amount
of man-made fires, under
President Bolsonaro’s
new policies.
Fires are actually de-
liberately started to create
land for cattle ranches.
This is not a new practice,
it has happened in all dry
seasons before, but the
current scale is worse than
ever. Brazil is the world’s
biggest beef producer,
and because there is
still a huge demand, the
Amazon is continually
exploited for cattle
ranching to bring in dirty
profit. Cattle ranching has
always been the leading
cause of deforestation and
it has been said to cause
80% of the ongoing de-

forestation in the amazon.
This is also incredibly
upsetting, as livestock is
a main driver of global
warming, thus in Brazil,
the very own thing that
has been slowing global
warming is being turned
to a contributing factor.
Amazon is not the only
part of nature damaged
by the beef industry; this
horrific industry is the
leading cause of deforest-
ation around the world.
It is deeply upsetting that
the demand for beef has
led to such devastating
fires in the lungs of our
planet; fires so widespread
that they can be seen from
space.

beef industry seems to be
largely ignored by media
companies. Indeed, even
though livestock is the
main contributor to global
warming, consuming
meat is still the status quo,
and popular press will
sidestep this issue, so their
content is more palatable
and likely to be shared
and make them profit.
The beef industry has also
spent a huge amount of
money on lobbying, and it
is likely that they have the
power to silence negative
press too. The ignoration
of the beef industry is
problematic, as this is
an important piece of
information that should be
passed on to consumers.
However,aspeoplewho
know better, we should
spread awareness on the
real cause of the Amazon
fires. Furthermore, as
consumers, we have the
power to combat de-
forestation by not buying
beef, and not creating the
demand for the product
that is the motive for mass
burning of the Amazon.
Lastly, it is also important
to put pressure on the
government as well and
participate in protests and
signing petitions. As part
of the Extinction Rebel-
lions, there are many cam-
paigns which aim to put
pressure on governments
and authorities. There will
be Extinction Rebellion
at Imperial and I highly
encourage everyone who
reads this to actively take
part.
