T
he Vice Presi-
dent (Advance-
ment) role was
recently filled
by Michael Murphy fol-
lowing the departure of
the previous VP, Sarah
Porter Waterbury, who
was the first person to
take up the role. His ap-
pointment was in June,
shortly before students
left for summer.
The Advancement
division, consisting of 80
staff, manages all aspects
of alumni relations. This
includes supporting net-
works of alumni across
the world, creating events
for them to attend, and
liaising with various
supporting groups. Pre-
dominantly, it features
fundraising for the college
as a core activity. In Mi-
chael’s words:
“The function of Ad-
vancement is mobilising
people and funds for the
mission of the college. We
run the entire graduation
event, as well as institu-
tional events like inau-
gural lectures, launching
initiatives we’ve raised
funds for. We also facil-
itate small gatherings of
alumni across the globe –
which are really important
networking and mentoring
events for them.”
Advancement also
handles alumni commu-
nications – such as the
Imperial magazine – and
facilitates consultation
with alumni on college
events, such as the sale of
St. Mary’s.
Last year, charitable
donations raised £65
million for the college,
which is essential for
supporting students and
faculty as well as the
physical infrastructure of
the college – needs that
are often not supported by
other income streams such
as sponsored research or
even other industry con-
nections. The core concept
is philanthropy, rather
than financial investment,
with private funding for
the university sourced
from the community it has
created.
Typically, these dona-
tions are ‘ringfenced’:
they are given in support
of a specific issue the
alum in question is pas-
sionate about, rather than
freely invested by the
college. This means that
the funds generally funnel
directly into benefitting
research – or students, via
donations for scholarships
and bursaries. Recent ex-
amples include donations
to the construction of
White City: £25 million
from alum Marit Mohn
toward the building for
the School of Public
Health to support research
into healthcare for young
people, and £40 million
from alum Sir Michael
Uren to the Biomedical
Engineering Research
Hub due to his personal
passion for integrated
interdisciplinary research.
Charitable fundraising
has been a staple of US
university finances for a
long time, but in recent
years has begun to migrate
across the Atlantic to the
UK. Here, universities
have a “hybrid” style of
funding between public
and private sources. This
is, in Michael’s view, the
right balance to have.
“In America, it has
gone way too much to the
private side; public unis
there are barely funded
by the state. They rely
so heavily on private
funding, on tuition, and
on earned income that
they lose some of the idea
of their public mission –
which is sad to see, and
I’d hate to see it happen in
the UK.”
The lack of public
fundingmeansthatstudent
high on Michael’s priority
list – “every student is a
future alum, and I love
that generational connec-
tion. We’re increasingly
looking to focus on fund-
raising for student support
through scholarships and
bursaries, which is a need
for the college. For me,
it’s about the people.”
Meanwhile, he says,
many other European
countries are still intro-
ducing a push toward
fundraising in conjunction
with state funding –
though there’s a reticence
in some areas, which
he attributes to a higher
proportion of their income
being from the state and
a resulting hesitance to
introduce private sources
of income.
Michael began his
career in the US himself,
working on funds and
then with admissions at
Antioch University. He
moved to Dublin City
University Educational
Trust as the Deputy CEO
because he found the idea
of growing philanthropic
infrastructure in Europe
more professionally ex-
citing. Philanthropy as it
is commonly understood
today began in Victorian
Britain, and originally
grew in the US as an emu-
lation – but there it stayed
and continued to blossom,
while the concept died
off in the UK between
the world wars. Aiding
in the reclamation of that
culture, and being at the
forefront of developing its
modern-day equivalent,
encouraged him to work
in Ireland and then in
London, fundraising for
the Royal Society’s 350th
anniversary and Kew
Gardens’Breathing Planet
campaign.
“For generations,
US universities have
been mobilising private
support for the work that
they do – so as a profes-
sional, working for US
universities is less inter-
esting. Reclaiming and
developing a new culture
is much more interesting
than just carrying on as
it’s ‘always been done’ as
part of a big machine. You
have to be more creative
as a professional, and you
have to have different
kinds of conversations
with people.”
Michael has also
specifically chosen to
work with scientific insti-
tutions, having a passion
for contributing to work
that genuinely endeavours
toward bettering the
world and describing this
as what “gets him out
of bed in the morning”.
He particularly enjoyed
working at Kew due to
their work on the Mil-
lennium Seed Bank and
defending biodiversity;
and additionally strongly
supports the work that Im-
perial researchers do on
sustainability, particularly
at Silwood Park. “Science
is a part of human endeav-
our, and of our culture.
We need science and
engineering to fight issues
such as biodiversity and
mass extinction.”
