League of Legends Season 9 Worlds: Group Stage
GAMES
Henry Alman
Editor-in-Chief
he group stage
will consist of
four sets of four
teams – three
teams from China (LPL),
two each from Europe
(EU), North America
(NA), Korea (KR), and
Taiwan/Hong Kong/
Macau (LMS), and one
from Vietnam (VCS).
They will be joined by four
more teams after a quali-
fying stage, featuring the
third seed teams from EU/
NA/KR/LMS, the second
seed from the VCS, and
several other teams from
smaller regions such as
Japan, Latin America, or
Turkey.
The group draw
brought considerable
attention to the flaws of
the system used – as with
every year, a “group of
death” was formed – this
year, group C - which is
aptly named due to it fea-
turing three of perhaps the
six strongest teams in the
tournament: EU’s Fnatic,
Korea’s (three-time world
champions) SKT, and
China’s RNG. Only two
groups can survive each
group and make it to the
knockout stage, meaning
at least one team of sem-
ifinals-level quality will
be eliminated before their
time.
Any of these three
top teams facing off is
guaranteed to be worth
watching. It’s possible
that Fnatic’s recently
developed aggressive
early-game playstyle
could reveal weaknesses
in SKT and RNG’s typ-
ically teamfight-based
strategies, which could
pose a serious threat to
either team throughout the
competition. However,
FNC are also notorious for
tilting, especially against
RNG who knocked them
out of MSI in 2018 and
Worlds in 2017. Mean-
while, SKT vs. RNG
can be expected to be a
hyper-carry slugfest, with
best-in-class players like
Uzi, Faker, Langx, and
Clid duking it out for su-
premacy. The play-in team
expected to join Group C
is NA’s third seed, Clutch
Gaming, whose top laner
Huni previously reached
semifinals with Fnatic in
2015 and the finals with
SKT in 2017 – making his
chance to ‘play spoiler’
one of the most exciting
narratives in this compe-
tition.
The other tough
group is Group A, with
Korean legends Griffin
matching up against EU’s
champion G2 – the team
that won MSI earlier this
year, giving Europe their
first major tournament
victory since the season
one World finals. Griffin
have historically choked
in high-pressure games,
failing to qualify for
Worlds last year despite
dominating in the LCK’s
regular season, and falling
“Group C
features 3
of the best 6
teams in the
tournament:
FNC, SKT, and
RNG”
“Worlds 2019
might offer
the most
competitive
and volatile
tournament in
years”
to SKT less than a month
ago in the 2019 summer
finals despite placing
three places higher in the
regular season. Whether
Griffin can withstand
G2’s chaotic, assas-
sin-heavy midgame-fo-
cused playstyle on the big
stage is the question on
everybody’s minds – and,
indeed, whether they can
swing back with their own
substantial clout and skill.
The third team joining
them is Cloud 9, NA’s
third seed – a definite
underdog, but one that
generates fear exclusively
at Worlds, where they
almost always escape
groups against expecta-
tions and represent NA
well (whether through
miracle or genius, often
on behalf of the unique
compositions constructed
by their coach Reapered.)
Meanwhile, other
groups have fallen in such
a way as to be considered
a ‘free pass’ for top teams.
Group B currently has
FunPlus Pheonix, the
LPL champions, facing
the LMS’ J Team and the
VCS’ Gigabyte Marines
– who famously upset
Fnatic and Immortals
with incredibly creative
strategies in 2017, rebel-
ling against the stale meta
at the time. Although
such upsets are always
possible, FPX (along with
star midlaner Doinb) have
looked dominant in one
of the world’s strongest
regions – and considering
the LMS’ devastating
exodus of talent to the
LPL, FPX shouldn’t
face much challenge.
Assuming no upsets in
the play-in stage, the only
contestants that can join
this group are EU’s or
KR’s third seeds – Splyce
or Damwon Gaming. Only
the latter of these would
generally be considered a
threat – despite Damwon
being comprised of
primarily young rookies
who are untested in
international waters – as
FPX’s typically Chinese
hyper-aggressive style
should match up well into
Splyce’s measured scaling
compositions.
Group D gives true
hope to NA, who have
fallen short in internation-
al tournaments for several
years. Their superteam
first seed, Team Liquid,
has been knocked out of
the group stage before –
and this year, they want
to demonstrate that they
truly are NA’s best team,
above C9’s significantly
better international
record. They took down
the LPL’s Invictus
Gaming – the 2018 world
champions – in the sem-
ifinal at MSI, to general
surprise, and now they
want to show it wasn’t a
fluke by dominating them
in the group stage. IG has
been underperforming
recently compared to
their electrifying 2018
Worlds performance, and
is known to be a volatile
team – the hope is that
they reach top form and
can look to compete for
the title, delivering even
more action than Worlds
already promises. If both
teams underperform, then
hope might go to one of
the LMS’ most famous
teams, ahq esports, but
with either Splyce or
Damwon likely to join the
group and be competing
for the top slots, their
chances are low. Liquid’s
hopes are also pinned to
Splyce joining the group
rather than Damwon
– their by-the-book play-
style with slower set-ups
is similar to Splyce’s, and
they can hope to simply
out-execute on their game
plan and in skirmishes or
teamfights. If Damwon
join the group, however,
and manage to perform
in front of the largest
crowds they’ve ever ex-
perienced, then Liquid are
facing down two highly
skilled and, importantly,
aggressive teams who will
exploit their tendency to
take some time to set up
their plays.
No matter what teams
emerge from the group
stage, we are guaranteed
some incredible perfor-
mances. With the gap
‘closing’ between the
East and West in terms of
skill, and Korea no longer
being the undisputed best
region,Worlds 2019 might
offer a more competitive,
versatile, and volatile
tournament than League
fans have experienced in
years.
