Dogfight
I
t is intriguing how
a musical with such
a fierce name can
be so gentle and
sensitive. Amidst the
brash soldiers and their
swearing, Dogfight shines
light on the importance
of not being judgmental
and accepting each others’
differences to work
together. Dogfight, in a
youth production by the
British Theatre Academy
at Southwark Playhouse,
transforms the room into
San Francisco in the 60s,
where a group of young
Marines are gearing up
to be shipped off to the
Vietnam war. Their last
night home manifests into
a twisted tale of debauch-
ery, heartbreak, and
eventually apprehension
for the life left behind.
The musical is based
on the 1991 movie of the
same name, a love story
between Eddie (Lucca
Chadwick-Patel), a newly
enlisted Marine, and Rose
(Ginnie Thompson), a
shy diner waitress. The
Marines host a party,
called the “dogfight”, to
celebrate their last night of
freedom. The “dogfight”
is a legendary night where
each Marine must bring
the ugliest girl they can
to the dance floor to win
a prize, and, of course,
bragging rights. Plot
twist though, Eddie falls
in love with his “ugly”
date, Rose, and realises
how horrible the dogfight
really is. The real ugly
people are the Marines
for being egotistical and
shallow.
The dramatic story
was spirited and unique,
and the passionate per-
formances by the soldiers
made it worthwhile.
The protagonists were
soldiers who objectified
women and took pleasure
in their degradation. It
was amazing how the
performance progressed
with the protagonists
becoming easily the most
hated characters for being
so condemnatory. The
convincingly cruel and
heartless personas of
Eddie and his comrades
were a testament to the
great acting of the cast,
with special mention
to Matty Collins and
James Knudsen for their
powerful performances.
The set and audience
seating were in a tightknit
space and the hilarious
interactions between
the cast and viewers
made the musical an
immersive experience,
especially the number
“Hey Good Lookin” when
the Marines went on the
quest to find dates for the
“dogfight”. Their liberal
use of foul language only
made it feel more comical
and real. However, given
how small the space was,
the musical numbers
could have been improved
with better acoustics. The
orchestra often took over
the singing making the
performance disjointed at
times.
Dogfight runs for an un-
interrupted 105 minutes,
which naturally led the
audience to get more
engrossed and invested
in the story - without any
popcorn or loo tainted dis-
tractions! Even with such
a serious performance,
dogfight was digestible
and tactfully conveyed a
difficult message about
sexism.
Despite their differenc-
es, the sense of camarade-
rie between the Marines
was beautiful, and the
audience was visibly
moved by the ultimate
battle scene when these
seemingly invincible
characters writhed in pain
and died. The best scene,
however, (SPOILER
ALERT) was the epic
strobe light scene when
Eddie is transformed
back to his grim reality
where he is on the bus
back home from war and
dogfight seems like just
an inconsequential misde-
meanour. The audience is
made aware that the major
part of the musical – the
dogfight, the mistreatment
of girls and the brother-
hood that was the Three
Bees was just ... a regret,
a flashback.
A story about toxic
masculinity and patri-
archy for objectifying
women and basing their
self worth solely on their
looks is as much of a
cautionary tale as it is a
reminder of times when
settings like this were
more prevalent. These
themes are still relevant
in today’s world where
misogynistic attitudes
continue to rear their ugly
heads from time to time.
The simplicity of the
set and characters gave a
raw and forceful message.
The plain set had minimal
props, meaning the actors
relied solely on their
acting to transform the
small room in London
into America in the 60’s.
Like all dogs in a fight,
the individual ‘dogs’ were
ultimately vulnerable
and innocent, as were the
Marines themselves.
Overall, Dogfight was
an excellent production
and not one to miss,
sending a message of
positivity and kindness.
