Time is a flat circle: Beatles back at No.1 after 50 years
What year is this? Are we back in 1969? Should I grow a
beard and organise a sit-in to save the squirrels? Take
my bell-bottoms and my guitar down King’s Road and
have a seance with Mick and Keith? Sadly not. But it
does prove that grat art is truly timeless, and certainly
deserving of another in-depth look.

“The real gems
lie at the end...
They show
what the band
is truly about.
But also that
they want
to shag the
queen”
T
his time last year
I was writing
an article on the
50th anniversary
of the White Album, and
ever since I put down the
proverbial pen I have been
looking forward to the
next one - Abbey Road.
As someone who believes
that the sun shone out
of their Scouse arses, I
was quite lenient on the
somewhat wonky White
Album, so get ready for
a litany of praise for an
album that, in my opinion,
brings together all the best
aspects of the Beatles in
47 minutes of rarefied
eargasm.
With the Beatles having
been teetering on the
edge of a breakup for the
previous few efforts, it is
no surprise that most look
at Abbey Road as the last
proper album of the Fab
Four’s Cannon (Sorry, Let
It Be). In fact, it may be
more surprising that they
managed to put out such
a coherent, if stylistically
incongruent, album with
theirmultitudesofcreative
differences. Doo-wop on
‘Oh! Darling’, sheer psy-
chedelic wondrousness
on ‘I Want You (She’s so
heavy)’, and plushy pop
par excellence mixed
with some melancholy on
‘Here Comes the Sun’,
are all weapons that they
amassed in their arsenal
throughout their tenure
as the world’s foremost
musical icons. It all comes
together beautifully.
But before diving into
the music, let’s get the
cover out of the way.
As is the case for pretty
much all of their covers,
there are many conspiracy
theories concerning it - to
no one’s surprise again
mostly about Paul being
dead and having been
replaced by an exact alien
replica. What else could
one interpret from the
fact that he is the only
one in the picture who
is barefoot while ALSO
smoking a cigarette…
Besides, the Abbey
Road strut is something
that every tourist who
happens to chance on that
particular zebra crossing
in St. John’s Wood aims
to recreate. Walking in
unison, they look singu-
larly determined, perhaps
for the last time before
their paths take them in
different directions. And
I am proud (YEAH I AM)
to say that it is an image
that has hung above this
author’s personal place of
nocturnal rest.
“Once there was a way
to get back homeward
// Once there was a way
to get back home” sings
Paul in a fragile voice
on ‘Golden Slumbers’.
Those times have long
gone for the fearsome
foursome. And so with
this album it is perhaps
prudent to focus on the
end. The medley which
makes up the second half
of the album, and begins
with ‘You Never Give
Me Your Money’ is one
of their most legendary
song sequences. It shows
the band’s ability to
make a melody, even
though it is composed
of mostly “unfinished”
songs. Like the song at
its outset, the medley as
a whole is composed of a
mosaic of different styles.
‘YNGMYM’ is a song
about losing control of the
band, both with regards its
management - “You never
give me your money //
You only give me your
funny paper // And in the
middle of negotiations
// You break down” - as
well as personal struggles
and tensions between the
members. It is a twofold
look back at the times
when things were easier,
and at the dead end road
they found themselves on
then: “But oh that magic
feeling // nowhere to go”.
Finally, it is a goodbye to
their time together “One
sweet dream // Pick up the
bags, get in the limousine
// Soon we’ll be away
from here // Step on the
gas and wipe that tear
away”. (I’m not crying,
you’re crying) And as the
final words echo, “One
sweet dream // came
true today,” the haunting
guitar arpeggios from
‘She’s So Heavy’ ring
out, ushering in a nursery
rhyme - “1,2,3,4,5,6,7 //
All good children go to
heaven”. The oxymoronic
way in which they can still
find humour in a matter
as serious as the band’s
apparently imminent
breakup is quintessen-
tially Beatles and sets the
tone for the whole medley.
There is Spanglish on
‘Sun King’, pure silliness
on ‘Mr. Mustard’, and
100% scouse filth on
‘Polythene Pam’ (about
sexy time with a woman
dressed only in poly-
thene - YIKES). On ‘She
Came in Through The
Bathroom Window’ they
recount the story of crazy
fans breaking into Paul’s
house, and that brings us
to ‘Golden Slumbers’.
There, further hope is
offered when McCart-
ney roars that “Golden
looking pretty much only
at the second half of the
album. Did I get carried
away? Affirmative. Could
I write three times as
much about the first half?
Indeed-y-o! The point
is that no one needs an
introduction to ‘Here
Comes the Sun’, ‘Come
Together’ or ‘She’s So
Heavy’. They are staples
of their repertoire that
every music fan should at
least slightly know. Even
the ridiculous ‘Octopus’s
Garden’ - the best thing
that Ringo ever touched
- and, depending on who
you believe, a tune either
about smoking weed out
of a hookah pipe or an
octopus salad that Mr.
Starr had while on a break
from the band, is instantly
recognisable. But the
real gems lie at the end.
They show what the band
is really about. And the
message that the album
ends on, “And in the end
// The love you take //
Is equal to the love you
make”, gives me goose-
bumps every time. The
final message, that is, if
you discount the fact that
the album actually ends
on a tune about how they
want to bang the queen.
That’s the Beatles for ya!
Her majesty’s a pretty nice girl! // Wikimedia
World domination by synchronous walking? // The Beatles
slumbers fill your eyes //
Smiles awake you when
you rise // Sleep pretty
darling, do not cry // And
I will sing a lullaby,”
continuing seamlessly
into ‘Carry That Weight’
where the middle verse
borrows the melody from
‘YNGMYM’, carrying on
the echo which makes the
medley feel so unified.
