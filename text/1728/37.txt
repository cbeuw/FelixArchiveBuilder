HANGMAN
Man with a placard
on Exhibition Road
confirms: this is time
it really is the end of
days.

Editor-in-Chief
F
ulham resident
Cliff Matthews,
44 can finally
hang up his
sandwich board and
megaphone. After an
unsuccessful 30 year
career in the apocalypse
predicting business he
has announced that he
will not be renewing the
lease on his soap box
on Exhibition Road. In
a NegaFelix exclusive,
Mathews revealed that
he came to the decision
after witnessing the
library toilet flood last
week. “In all my years
of screaming at people
to repent I have never
seen horrors like this.
The scale of an event
large enough to pull
Business school students
away from their spread-
sheets terrifies me. It
can only have been an
act of God.” The flood
comes hot on the heels
of reports of an inferno
at Ethos, and a plague of
rats in the Beit kitchens.
Fears of a cataclysm
has caused a slump in
local house prices. One
homeowner that de-
clined to be named told
NegaFelix ‘the house was
meant to be an investment
– my insurance doesn’t
cover some cheap Morgan
Freeman knockoff ruining
my portfolio’ the man’s
neighbour added ‘ I have
so much oil money in
here, if there is a fire there
won’t be enough of South
Ken left to flood’.
Our psychic corre-
spondent, M.Meg, is
less convinced. “While
Mathews was a big name
in the industry he was not
the only authority on the
subject. There are still lots
of doom loons out there
who remember the dryrot
case in Blackett. While it
caused huge panic at the
time those who lost their
cool were widely criti-
cised afterwards.”
Despite repeated
emails to his secretary,
God has not been forth-
coming with a comment
on the recent events. Alice
Ghast’s office on the
other hand has been very
helpful, with Isabelle Gurt
(Vice Provost - Goats)
providing precise details
on when and where the
AntiChrist will rise.
