A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
After this, our
conversation turned
towards a longer
discussionofAbhijay’s
role as a student
representative, with
particular reference
to College Council, the
most senior decision-
making body of
Imperial on which
he is the sole student
representative. The
other members
include very senior
m a n a g e m e n t ,
external members
whoactasconsultants
and watchdogs, each
Faculty Dean, and
one elected member
of teaching staff.
Abhijay could not
share a lot of what
is discussed at the
Council, as much of
what is discussed is
strictly confidential.
Although some are
not – for example,
discussions about
the sale of St. Mary’s
have been going on
since before he joined
Council and are still
going. This raised a
question.
Felix: If the informa-
tion is confidential,
and you can’t share
it, even with other
senior members of
the Union, how are
you meant to act
upon any of it in the
student interest?
APS: To speak on behalf
of one of my predecessors,
they could not use infor-
mation learned in Council
to help with a campaign
they were running – even
though that information
might have been useful.
Usually it’s not even so
much that I couldn’t share
something, but that if I
did, I’d likely be kept out
of the loop in some future
decision and then no
student would have any
say.
Felix: So your hands
are tied? Does that
mean that to really
change anything,
the Union should be
taking a more oppo-
sitional approach?
APS: It could mean that.
You’re not the first person
to point out that the close
relationship this Union has
with this university can
be used against us – that
individuals might say “we
have so much influence at
the moment, why would
we do anything to risk
that?” And if that means
they have to accept some
poor decision ‘X’ or lack
of consultation, then that’s
what happens.
From my perspective,
the first thing we’d need
to do is start thinking
about leverage. I think a
lot of my predecessors
have gone in and tried
to change the minds of
others around them with
compelling arguments
and evidence alone. It’s a
trap that a lot of Imperial
students fall into. They’d
think that if we just had the
right facts, we’d be able
to change people’s minds,
but if someone else has all
the power and is dead set
on doing something you
disagree with, no amount
of rational argument is
necessarily going to shift
things. You have to think
about leverage, power re-
lations, changing people’s
incentives.
Felix: What sort of
leverage are you
talking about?
APS: One place to start is
with student satisfaction.
Felix: But the scores
have been low for
so long. Isn’t that
mostly something
departments ad-
dress, rather than the
College as a whole?
APS: I don’t think so.
I think maybe in the
beginning people saw
the satisfaction scores
as particular problems
to be resolved within
particular courses, but
now there’s a growing
awareness among senior
management that the
issue is broader. Both the
Provost and Vice-Provost
(Education) are talking
about the “holistic student
experience.” If services
are cut, bad academic
decisions are made,
and buildings like St.
Mary’s are sold without
forewarning, students see
that as all being from the
same thing: ‘Imperial’.
The point that is starting
to be made, the point we
should be making, is that
you cannot fix one issue
with satisfaction without
addressing the others. It
doesn’t make sense to
invest tens of millions in
one place while cutting
hundreds of thousands
from somewhere else.
Felix: What else can
you do at the mo-
ment? What needs to
change?
APS: In the short term, it’s
about making my voice
heard during discussions.
I’ve already been told
I’m a lot more outspoken
in places like Council
than my predecessors,
and that’s not a bad place
to start. More generally
though, I think we need to
look fundamentally at the
way decisions are being
made at Imperial.
I strongly believe that
people who are affected
by decisions should be
involved in the deci-
sion-making process. I
don’t want the students
on the other side of the
table, trying to influence
decision-making from
the outside, I want them
on the same side of the
table, being one of the
groups making the deci-
sions. The same goes for
oft-overlooked academic
or support staff. I want
to go further than simply
‘consultation,’ – which
often becomes a check-
box exercise – and think
about ‘consent,’ having a
say over things.
I think this would lead
to less friction between
students and staff, de-
partmental and senior
staff, and so on. If we
were involved earlier on,
results would be better,
and people will feel, even
if the broad outlines of
decisions are the same,
that they’ve been brought
along.
Felix: This is all very
general stuff – have
you thought about
specifics?
APS: I have. The first
thing I want to do is sit
down with experienced
staff in the union and look
at places where we think
different representation
might be needed, which I
intend to do immediately
afterWelcome. I then want
to shape a plan talking to
as many reps as possible,
down to department
level, both undergraduate
and postgraduate, the
Union Council and its
subcommittees. I want to
talk with staff – the trade
unions, heads of depart-
ment, Deans, Vice Deans,
senior administration
roles within faculties, all
the way to the College
Secretary, Provost, and
President. This should
allow us to come up
with something a large
number of people can get
behind, that’s pragmatic,
while also allowing us to
address the root causes
of problems at Imperial,
not just papering over the
cracks.
Abhijay will work on major projects with the other full time reps this year // ICU
