Lessons Learned
nother week,
another issue.
I’m writing this
on Monday, so
I sincerely hope that it’s
the best issue of Felix ever
and is such a revolution
in the very conception
of journalistic tour-de-
forces that my name shall
forever go down in history
as “King Henry the IX of
Writing Stuff Gooder.”
This is only week two,
and that’s not how the
world works - ah, if only
simply thinking about
something really hard
could action our dreams
in reality. No, the real
world is a much more
dreary (but, perhaps,
more rewarding) affair of
making tiny incremental
improvements over the
course of ages. Thus,
we are still on a steep
learning curve and have
a long way to go in terms
of perfecting this year’s
Felix. Last week saw
some fantastic content in
the paper, marred by a few
copy mistakes - the former
of which was heartening,
while the latter was dev-
astating.
This week, I wanted
to give you, the reader,
a little insight into how
Felix works, and how
things can go wrong,
and how copy mistakes
can happen. Take it as a
lesson, if you want, but
I won’t dictate which
one - I’m a firm believer
that a story can have many
parables contained within,
and I hope that you find
something of value in this
one. That may be not to
obsess over perfectionism
and to take the good with
the bad. It may be to
realise that the best way
to make up for a mistake
is to proactively improve
for the future rather than
attempt to retroactively
correct.
The lesson might also
be that laughing at one’s
own misfortune makes it
all a little more bearable
- a lesson I think Imperial
students learn very well
very quickly.
You’ll each take away
the one that will help you
the most - or maybe I’m
just talking some right
‘pretentious twaddle’ and
should just get on with it.
First, a little bit of
behind-the-scenes insight:
before the beginning
of each year, the Editor
builds up a team, and
trains them as soon as pos-
sible (depending on their
pre-term availability). The
first issue rolls around: we
confirm page numbers on
the Tuesday and lay out
the articles using InDe-
sign on the Wednesday
- and then Thursday is for
copyediting, any last-min-
ute laying out, invariably
axing some pages when
somebody sends you a
three-page Welcome Fair
Map to include out-of-
the-blue at 5pm on the
day of publication, and so
on. Then, come Thursday
evening, I finally spend
a long while compiling
all that hard work and
sending it to print.
This should work out
cleanly and nicely - and
indeed, we had plenty of
people providing great
content and a mostly-full
team, so that stage was
fantastic. As I said last
week, the team did a
smashing job. The prob-
lems came on Wednesday
and Thursday.
One thing many readers
may not notice is that the
amount of team turnover
Felix experiences each
year can vary massively.
Sometimes the turnover
is very minimal, with
few editors graduating
or moving on - and those
later-year students are
already trained, already
have good working rela-
tionships with writers, and
are often around before
the beginning of term.
This year, however,
we lost almost two-thirds
of our editorial team
during summer. This was
officially designated as
‘sad times’ as a lot of our
little internal community
got the Thanos treatment.
Actually, as it was almost
two-thirds of the team,
they outdid Thanos.
But for the paper, this
can be a positive thing -
especially in the long run.
We’ve got new voices and
fresh ideas and perspec-
tives popping up all over
already. It’s invigorating,
it’s exciting, and it was
a pleasure to receive
so many emails from
incoming first-year stu-
dents who wanted to get
involved before they even
arrived. We had articles in
the paper written by new
students, who then arrived
at halls to find their work
printed and on their desks
already. That’s awesome.
This is the new generation
of Felix.
However, it does
come with the smallest
downside: nobody is
trained in InDesign, and
nobody is in the country
to be trained, before term
starts. Although we had
great content, we had
almost nobody available
to actually lay any of it
out, nevermind to then
copyedit it afterwards
to check for those silly
mistakes that inevitably
happen. Wednesday and
Thursday quickly turned
into a mad scramble to
get everything together as
the articles came flooding
in, with those few trained
and available members of
the team putting in some
Herculean efforts to get
everything done on time.
I won’t shout them out
publicly, but they know
who they are.
Of course, I haven’t
even touched on the slew
of tech problems we’ve
been assailed with.
This is how you end up
with the copy mistakes
Felix saw last week.
Everyone put in 100%, or
even more than could ever
be reasonably expected,
but it wasn’t enough to
make the perfect paper
- yet. Sometimes that’s
just how things pan out. I
was frustrated, but again,
it was a good-natured
and very tired team who
got me back on my feet
and immediately looking
towards this week and
how to improve.
‘Another week, another
issue’ may become a
mantra of mine this year,
a way to remind myself to
look forward and ascend
ever-forward toward a
throne with “Writing Stuff
Gooder” emblazoned on
the seat.
