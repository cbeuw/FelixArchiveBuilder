Tensions rise as the Brazil’s Amazon falls
How the yearlong blazes in the Amazon rainforest have resulted in heated international relations

B
razil, the largest
country in
South America,
is home to
over 50% of the Amazon
rainforest, a region that
contains half of all extant
terrestrial animal species
and is responsible for
producing around 20% of
our planets oxygen. As of
the first week of October
2019, there had already
been over 121,000 record-
ed fires in the Brazilian
Amazon. This is a 45%
increase when compared
to the same period last
year. While that number is
increasing at an unwaver-
ing rate, it’s not just the
frequency of fires that’s
raising alarms, but also
their magnitudes. Fires
reached a scale so large
that in mid-August NASA
reported that the blazes
were visible from space.
Wild fires in the
Amazon are perfectly
normal during the summer
months, during which the
rainforest experiences a
dry season, however, the
Brazilian Amazon has
been notably moist this
year according to Univer-
sity of Birmingham ecol-
ogist Adriane Muelbert.
Whilst the exact causes
of the infernal destruction
aren’t certain, the moist
conditions strongly imply
an unnatural origin. A
researcher at Brazil’s
National Institute for
Space Research (INPE)
has suggested that 99%
of the fires result from
human activity, either on
purpose or by accident.’
Globally, the single
largest direct cause of
tropical deforestation is
conversion to cropland
and pasture for food,
in order to grow crops
and raise livestock. The
slash and burn method,
in which forest is cut and
any remaining vegetation
burned to produce fertile
land, is particularly
popular among Brazilian
farmers and ranchers.
However, the initial
clearance can lead to a
far greater amount of
destruction than intended
when some vegetation is
left intact. The felling of
trees in the initial cutting
tears a hole in the usually
continuous canopy,
exposing vegetation on
the forest floor to the
intense tropical sun and
increasing the likelihood
of a fire starting.
Such a dramatic
increase in the scale of
the human exploitation
of one of Earth’s most
biodiverse regions in
contrast to previous years
begs the question, what
has changed? On the 1st
of January 2019, Jair
Bolsonaro assumed the
role of the 38th president
of Brazil. Described as a
National Conservative,
a focal point of his
campaign and subsequent
policies has been the
acceleration of growth
for Brazil’s economy by
permitting access to the
Amazon’s natural resourc-
es for mining, logging and
agriculture.Such a utilisa-
tion naturally requires the
removal of the primary
forests on which it will
take place and Bolsonaro
has repeatedly dismissed
pleas to preserve the rain-
forest in its entirety, saying
that European countries
have already “destroyed
their environment” and
maintaining the stance
that Brazil preserves their
rainforest “more than
anyone”. At a recent UN
conference in New York,
Bolsonaro also claimed
that it was a “fallacy” to
describe the Amazon as
the heritage of humanity
and a “misconception”
that the forests are the
lungs of the planet In the
wake of such comments,
many environmentalists
are accusing the presi-
dent’s policies of being
the root cause of the fires
that have devastated the
Amazon this year, with
his encouragement of
cattle farmers and loggers
to clear land for their prac-
tices being the focus of
their criticism. Following
reports by Brazil’s own
INPE that Destruction
of the Amazon rainforest
had increased by 88%
for the month of June
2019, which the president
rejected as false data,
Bolsonaro claimed that
that his government lacks
the resources to fight the
wildfires in the Amazon.
Despite this contention, he
declined to accept a lump
sum of $22m (£18m) from
the G7 , an intergovern-
mental group consisting
of the seven ‘largest
advanced economies’ in
the world, which aimed to
aid the battle against the
ever growing crisis.
to the commercialisa-
tion of the rainforest. A
common theme among
demonstrators was their
discouragement of beef
consumption and for
good reason. According
to the Yale School of
Forestry and Environ-
mental Studies, cattle
ranchingSSSS is the
largest driver of deforest-
ation in the Amazon, ac-
counting for 80 per cent
of current deforestation
rates leading to proposals
from European govern-
ment officials that the EU
should ban the import of
beef from Brazil. It’s not
just the public who are
taking action, multiple
European governments
have threatened to
abandon trade deals with
Brazil following disputes
with the president over
his environmental policy.
Germany and Norway
have also stopped
contributing to an aid
fund for the country. A
particularly confronta-
tional exchange occurred
between the Brazilian
president and French
President Emmanuel
Macron on social media
after Bolsonaro liked
a Facebook comment
mocking Macron for
marrying a woman 25
years his senior. The
instance of playground
politics was spurred on
by France’s attempt to
block the ratification of a
trade deal between South
America and the EU.If
the political and envi-
ronmental chaos that has
erupted since Bolsona-
ro’s election is indicative
of the remainder of his
term, Brazil is in for an
interesting three years.
