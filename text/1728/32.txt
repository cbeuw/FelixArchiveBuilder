Things to
consider as a
student of City
and Guilds, and
a member of our
student union:
T
he constituent
college system
at Imperial has a
number of disad-
vantages, not least that the
system is very confusing
at times. However, there
are also benefits that can
and should be exploited
by the students. Having a
constituent college union
to represent you means
that the link between
you (the student) and the
bureaucracy that runs this
place is a good deal closer
than it might be.
Imperial is such a large
place that it is difficult to
form any sort of commu-
nity – this is where the
CGCU provide a more
local feeling of identity.
People studying similar
subjects do have a better
understanding of each
other’s problems and this
is why the CGCU is a
vital link in the academic
affairs of the college as a
whole. Find out who your
Academic, Welfare, and
Dep Reps are. They’re
not just there for you
to complain about your
degree.
The Constituent Union
system here dates back
a long way and as such
has a lot of historical and
traditional weight behind
it. This might seem trivial
now whilst you’re just
going to lectures and
passing exams to get your
degree, but when you see
the change in people’s
attitude towards you when
you say you’re at Imperial
then you start to get some
idea of the influence this
place has.
The only way a lot of
people will realise this is
when you graduate with
the letters ACGI after
could well play a major
part in your career.
Please take an interest
in what your Constituent
Union does for you - if
you don’t take an interest,
don’t care, then don’t
whinge about the things
that are going on. This
is a democratic society.
If you want your say
you’ve got it, but if you’re
not prepared to take an
interest then don’t be
surprised if nothing gets
done.

Chris Carter
RSMU President
C
ongratulations
on making it
through your
first week of
a new year at Imperial!
Whether you’re a new
or returning student, the
first week is always quite
hectic. Hopefully, some of
you managed to make use
of the ten minutes of sun-
shine at Welcome Fair and
join some clubs, societies,
or projects.
This week’s column is
about mascots, traditions,
and rivalries, of which the
RSMU has many. If you
visited the RSMU stand
at either the International
Students Fair on Sunday
or the Welcome Fair on
Tuesday, you will have
seen a giant brass mining
lamp. This lamp is our
pride and joy: the Davy.
Three feet tall, with a
weight of 60-70kg, this
still functional mining
lamp allegedly has teeth
marks in it from when a
passionate Miner attempt-
ed to lift it this unusual
way (not recommended).
The Davy was acquired
by the RSMU at some
unknown point in time
and is now our main
mascot. We even have
a role on our committee
called Davy Bearer, who
is tasked with keeping the
Davy safe and stealing
the other Constituent
Union mascots: Theta (the
RCSU’s 8-foot-long ther-
mometer), the Spanner
and Bolt (the CGCU’s
giant spanner and a bolt,
modelled after those
used in Tower Bridge)
and some weird chicken
costume (the ICSMSU’s
bright yellow phoenix
costume). This tradition
is known as ‘mascotry’
and keeps the Constituent
Union rivalries burning.
Each Constituent Union
also has motor mascots,
maintained by the associ-
ated Motor Club (which
anyone can join). These
vehicles can often be seen
ferrying students between
locations or on display
at events. The RSMU is
proud to be represented by
Clementine II, a Morris
1-Ton Truck acquired by
the RSMU in 1960, while
the RCSU has Jez, a 1916
Dennis N-type fire engine,
and the CGCU has Bo’.
But by far the RSMU’s
fiercest rivalry is with
the Camborne School of
City of London Crest on a lampost in London. Together with 12
Livery Companies the City of London Corporation founded the City & Guilds
College // CGCU
“The
constituent
college system
at Imperial has
a number of
disadvantag-
es“
“This is where
the CGCU
provides a
more local
feeling of
identity”

your name. These are
internationally recognised
and only applicable to
those who graduate from
City and Guilds (not just
Imperial). The Constitu-
ent Union system, perhaps
a mere quirk to you now,
Mines, part of the Uni-
versity of Exeter. Every
year, hundreds of RSMU
members take part in a
weekend of sport, either
as spectators or players.
The ‘Bottle Match’ is
held alternately between
London and Cornwall
every February. All our
sports teams compete
for their own trophies,
with the rugby match
finishing off two days of
fixtures to win the titular
‘Bottle’! This is basical-
ly a plug for our sports
teams – if you didn’t
fancy running through
the rain to get to their
stall at Welcome Fair,
it’s never too late! You
can find all our sports
teams and their captain’s
contact details on the
Imperial College Union
website.
That’s all from me this
week, but I hope you all
had a great first week!
