ICSWP IS BACK WITH A SPLASH
Big goals, big wins, big moves (both in the pool and la metrique). Last season was the best yet for ICSWP.

L
ast season, the
women’s polo
team saw a
record number
of players and went
from struggling to field
a base team to taking a
full subs bench to almost
every game. Working
hard through the season
gave them some big big
wins, and a tiny 10-5 loss
to Bristol (compared to
like 30-1 for the last few
years… allow it), finish-
ing 4th in the Premier
South division.
The men’s team also
had a great season and
saw some of the best plays
in years, beating Bristol
and making history. A few
more wins and they found
themselves in sudden
death penalties and just
losing out to Cardiff in the
quarter finals. Absolute
scenes.
The LUSL 1s took
home both the varsity and
LUSL trophies (as usual)
and the LUSL 2s won
their varsity against their
(very) slippery opponents
with the biggest fan base
in history #upthe2s.
Meanwhile, the swimmers
stormed to second position
in the London League and
recorded a number of PB
times at BUCS compe-
definitely lose. After a
quick dip and most of the
players complaining that
the sea was ‘too salty’,
the team resorted to beach
volley ball for training.
Unsurprisingly, they
struggled in the games,
and the total number of
goals scored was less than
the number of jellyfish
stings received (only 6).
These goals were scored
almost entirely by the
supreme double team
Sasha Walter and Lorenzo
TJ Signore, assisted from
afar by the coach who was
not allowed in the sea or
near the beach due to a
diving injury. With an ad-
ditional sneaky shot from
the wing from Ryan ‘The
Rhino’ Clarke, ICSWP
surprisingly didn’t come
last.
The 8th (out of 9) place
trophy was paraded in
front of the local press
before being proudly
flown home to Ethos.
What a send off for our
leaving players, this tour
will be hard to forget
#ICSWP.
The swimmers also had
their fair share of some
extra salty sea, heading
to Bournemouth for the
Salty Sea Dog (very very)
last IC swim, with the
legendary Marco Corrao
securing the bronze in
the men’s category. He
was followed closely by
teammates Corney, Kirill
and Arturolo, taking 4th
5th and 6th respectively!
Like their polo team
mates, the swimmers look
forward to more success,
more travels and lots more
metrique in the new year!
This year ICSWP
have taken on a new lead
swimming coach, and an
additional polo coach, as
well as adding four new
training sessions to their
schedule. Last season
was incredible and this
one will be even better!
Whether you want to just
swim to de-stress, swim
competitively, play seri-
ously with one of our polo
teams or just try polo and
have some fun - this year
we really do have it all!
