Alex Auyang
RCSU President
I
f you go through old
RCSU promotional
material, you might
see this titbit:
“Founded in 1881
alongside the Royal
College of Science itself,
legend has it that science
fiction writer H.G. Wells
was its first student
leader.”
I always liked this.
It contributed to the
mythology of the RCSU
and made my position
as president feel more
special. If someone like
Wells had been president
too, perhaps I had a
chance of becoming just
as acclaimed.
However, the plot
thickened after I read
through Wells’ Wikipedia
page. His term as presi-
dent of the RCSU suppos-
edly began in 1909, but
the RCSU was founded in
1881. How could he have
been the first president
if his term started 28
years after the union was
founded? It turns out that
this titbit was called a
‘legend’ for good reason.
Wells had no part in
founding the RCSU and
was never the president.
In fact, he established the
RCSA, our alumni associ-
ation, not the RCSU.
At first, this develop-
ment bothered me. I really
enjoyed thinking that I
was following in the foot-
steps of a literary giant.
But still, while it might’ve
been nice if it were true,
it’s also nice knowing
‘the’ truth. And I think,
as the union of scientists,
the truth is something we
really ought to value.
Also, my motivation
as president should be
validated by more than
historical precedent. I
should put in the effort
because I want to, and not
because some famous guy
did too.
I think that this lesson
extends to many aspects
of university life. If
you’re fresh out of high
school, this may be the
first time you’ve gotten to
choose what you’re doing
with yourself. You should
study because you want to,
not just because there is a
precedent that you’re told
to follow. The same goes
for recreation, societies,
and just about everything
else. If you abide by this,
you’ll probably find that:
1. You won’t be
studying something you
hate for 3-4 years, and
2. At the end of your
degree, you’ll be happy
you made decisions on
your own.
If you’d like to get
involved with the RCSU,
learn more about us,
or write in this section
of Felix, swing by our
ofﬁce. It’s in the Sherﬁeld
building (the one with the
junior common room in it).
If you follow the walkway,
there is a door next to the
Santander. Walk through
that door and make your
way down the hallway to
ﬁnd our ofﬁce. There is
usually someone from our
committee there that will
help you out. You could
also send me an email at
rcsupres@ic.ac.uk.
