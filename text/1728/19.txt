THROWBACK felix@imperial.ac.uk
This year is Felix’s 70th anniversary, so we’re celebrating with a look back at some of the best moments from
our long history. This week, we show off our legacy with the front page of the first ever issue in 1949 - when Felix
cost money to purchase, and sold out in less than an hour.
