here are those
today that would
argue that the
British political
system has become calci-
fied and unfit for purpose.
The highly divisive issue
of Brexit has split both
parties down the middle
and led to endless debates
about the precise nature
of the UK’s exit from the
European Union. It often
seems as though the same
issues that were being
debated six months ago
are being debated now.
The Irish backstop was
one of the major issues
plaguing May’s deal
and it continues to harry
Boris Johnson now. The
intractability of the whole
issue has proved highly
frustrating, with politi-
cians and people either
desiring Brexit now, a no-
deal now, or no Brexit at
all. Above anything else,
what the British people
appear to desire is closure.
One man that has
been prepared to give the
British people this sense
of closure has had a rather
alarming recall to reality
in the past two weeks.
Following his election to
the role of Prime Minister
by the members of the
Conservative party on
the 24th of July this year,
Boris Johnson has been
committed to delivering
Brexit within the official
deadline of the 31st
October, with or without
a deal.
Johnson totally failed
to progress his No-Deal
agenda after facing severe
opposition from the House
of Commons and made
the political decision to
prorogue Parliament for 5
weeks starting on the 10th
September. The official
justification he provided
was that this unprece-
dented 5-week suspension
was to prepare for a new
Queen’s speech, where
he would lay out his new
and exciting agenda of tax
cuts and spending plans.
However, given the prox-
imity of the long proroga-
tion to the 31st October,
many in Parliament took
the idea that this was done
in order to prevent MPs
from passing legislation
that would potentially
prevent a no deal Brexit.
MPs swiftly took action
to seize control of the
business of the House and
proposed a motion that
would prevent the Prime
Minister from leaving the
EU without a deal. Both
of these motions passed,
preventing the govern-
ment from proposing
additional legislation, and
legally blocking Johnson
from committing to a
No-Deal, instead forcing
him to extend the deadline
and continue negotiations.
In response to this
Johnson attempted to
trigger an early general
election, but political
parties in opposition and
21 of his own MPs voted
against the government
and he failed to reach
the necessary two thirds
majority. After this vote,
Parliament was pro-
rogued. This prorogation
was scheduled to end
14th October. During this
period of prorogation, two
court cases went through
the English and Scottish
courts, one from Gina
Miller, an anti-Brexit
campaigner and one from
a cross party group of
MPs. Both cases were
heard, and the ultimate
result was that Johnson’s
prorogation was deemed
“to have no effect.” Par-
It is clear, from the
recent court judgement
that the institutions of
the UK have come under
direct attack from a group
of individuals that have
no regard for them. Their
singular desire to deliver

“The Irish

“Above

else what
the British
people appear

Brexit above all else moti-
vated them to perform an
act that compromised the
integrity of the unwritten
UK constitution. It is of
great comfort then that the
institutions available to
the British state, namely
the courts, have been more
than capable of thwarting
their actions. The UK
government institutions
are largely robust.
The one, possibly con-
troversial, key takeaway
of the series of events we
have witnessed in the last
month and a half is that it is
possible to make progress
on Brexit. Legally ruling
out an option, despite what
ardent Leavers may claim,
is still progress towards an
eventualsolution.Brexitis
possibly the most complex
and difficult political
and legal problem that
the United Kingdom has
encountered for the last
40 years. It has not been
easy, it will not be easy.
The risk now is that the
Johnson administration
will ignore the legislation.
The current Chancellor
Sajid Javid has repeatedly
made reference to the pos-
sibility of a no deal Brexit,
as has Johnson. This is an
unacceptable attack on the
sovereignty of Parliament
and speaks volumes as to
their true intentions- to
utilise Brexit as a political
tool for winning the next
election as opposed to
doing the best thing for
the country. This is not
good governance and it is
certainly poor policy for
our county.
It is time to ignore
the fickle, so called
“will of the people,” and
their desperate desire
for closure. Instead, we
should demand that our
politicians do their jobs
and work for the country
as opposed to their narrow
political objectives.
