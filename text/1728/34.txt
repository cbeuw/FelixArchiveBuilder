arkets bring
t o g e t h e r
buyers and
sellers, and
money flows between the
two groups. Think about
a farmer’s market where
a burger is being sold by
the vendors and cash is
paid out from the consum-
ers’ wallets. Similarly, a
financial market is a place
where products called se-
curities are being traded.
When buyers and sellers
do not have a direct link
for trade, financial market
intermediaries come into
action. This article will
introduce the key par-
ticipants in the financial
market.
Sellers
The seller in the
financial market is the
“issuer” – a legal entity
(government or corpora-
tion) that sells securities
such as equities, bonds,
currencies and derivatives
to the public in order to
finance its operations.
For example, Company
ABC makes a public

other entity (institutional
investor).Investors have
the money and will
commit capital with the
expectation of receiving
financial returns. Inves-
tors could buy Company
ABC’s shares in the hope
that these shares will rise
in value in the future,
or they could buy the
government bonds and
receive regular interest
payment. Other common
investment products
include commodities,
real estate, mutual funds,
options and futures.
Investors can also
participate in the financial
market through trading,
which is a way of profit-
ing through stock price
fluctuations.
People who work
in financial firms that
make trades on behalf of
investors are known as
“traders”. Traders observe
trades within a single day
by examining how prices
and money move in the
market. Some use techni-
cal analysis to determine
which way a stock will
move whilst some study
the fundamentals beind a
stock (the business of the
company, the health of
the industry it operates in
etc). Most banks have a
Sales and Trading (S&T)
Division, where trading
roles are found. There
are also trading houses
that specialise in trading
a specific product. For
example, Glencore and
Vitol are commodity
trading companies.
Financial
Intermediaries
These are the middle-
men between two parties
in a financial transaction.
For example, a financial
intermediary can facilitate
the fund flow between
issuers and investors.
There are many different
types of financial interme-
diaries including mutual
funds, investment banks
and commercial banks.
Investment banks
provide services such as
underwriting, facilitating
initial public offerings
(IPOs), facilitating
mergers and acquisitions
(M&A) and acting as a
broker or financial advisor
for institutional clients.
Investment banks
belong to a group of
firms within the industry
commonly known as the
“sell-side”.
Jobs include investment
banking, equity research,
sales and trading. Major
investment banks include
JPMorgan Chase,
Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley, Citigroup, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch
and Credit Suisse.
Mutual funds provide
active management of
money pooled by inves-
tors. The fund managers
generate capital for the in-
vestors through investing
in a variety of investment
products with the antici-
pation to outperform the
market.
Mutual funds belong
to a group of firms within
the industry commonly
known as the “buy-side”.
Jobs include portfolio/
asset management, wealth
management, private
equity, venture capital and
hedge funds. Many banks
in the sell-side also have
these divisions. Non-bank
investment management
companies include Man
Group, Bridgewater Asso-
ciates and Schroders.
Commercial banks
provide account services
and loan services to con-
sumers (like us) and small
businesses.
Regulators
Federal and state gov-
ernments have a myriad
of agencies that regulate
and oversee the financial
markets. These agencies
monitor the behaviours of
the different players in the
market by setting restric-
tions and guidelines. One
of the most powerful and
comprehensive agencies
in the US is Securities and
Exchange Commission
(SEC). It enforces the
federal securities laws and
regulates US stock ex-
changes, options markets
and exchanges. In the UK,
the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) has the
responsibility to ensure
the UK market functions
well.
Central Banks
Acentral bank manages
a nation’s currency,
money supply, interest
rate, oversees the com-
mercial banking system,
and formulates and
implements the nations
monetary policy. The
Federal Reserve System
, also known as the FED,
is the central bank of the
US and is arguably the
most powerful financial
institution in the world.
Decisions made by the
central banks and regula-
tors have an impact on the
entire financial market.
For example, deregulation
in the financial industry in
the late 1990s, combined
with FED’s adjustments in
interest rates in the 2000s,
led to the increase in size
and the eventual burst of
an asset bubble, creating a
banking crisis in 2007 and
2008 known as the Global
Financial Crisis.
Investing in Ukrainian debt – a remarkable opportunity
in the negative-yield debt environment

T
he current
state of global
markets, led by
such factors as
close-or-below zero in-
terest rates, widely spread
negative-yield bonds and
approaching slowdown
in several major world’s
economies, leave hardly
any secure options that
offer returns high enough
to at least outweigh pro-
jected annual inflation.
Keeping all those cir-
cumstances in mind, it is
possibly just an ideal time
to look at alternative, more
profitable (but also riski-
er) forms of investments,
and government bonds of
an emerging economy suit
well enough. Although
there is a plethora of
countries that align with
this description, in this
article we want to draw
your attention to only one
of them – Ukraine, that
seems to have recovered
from challenges of the
past and now heads to a
brighter future.
On 21st April, the
second tour of President
Elections in Ukraine
has come to an end, and
Volodymyr Zelensky,
previously recognised
among general population
as a talented TV-comedi-
an, was elected to be the
country’s leader for the
next five years. His started
firmly, by firing several
ministers and dissolving
the Parliament, whilst
his party, “Servant of the
People”, has gained more
than 40% on the early
parliament elections. It
seems that global expec-
tations on the Ukrainian
economy are rising, and
so is the share of the
foreign investors in its
regional markets. So how
does Zelensky’s progres-
sive policy match with
the economic prospects,
and what does it mean for
potential investors?
Let’s begin our analysis
with possibly the most im-
portant factor to consider
when looking into any
government bond - the
country’s ability to pay
its debt back, which in
turn directly depends on
how stable the current
economic situation is.
GDP (that is a key bench-
mark for any economy)
starts to gain further
growth momentum, as the
World Bank predicts 3.4%
offering of shares to
finance its business
expansion in a similar
manner to how food truck
company XYZ makes and
sells sausages to cover the
labour cost. Governments
can also sell securities
by creating bonds for
purposes such as raising
money for road mainte-
nance.
Buyers

individual investor) or
