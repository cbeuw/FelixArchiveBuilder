Meet the Music Team!
Get to know the new Felix Music team, read a bit about their music taste and how they ended up writing here.
I
am becoming old. I
know this because,
when I respond “still
not sure” to people
who ask me what I want
to do with my life, they
look at me with more
disdain than reassurance.
I’m not sure when this
suddenly happened, but I
think it’s being reflected
in my music listening too.
My listening experi-
ence has gone all around
but also nowhere at all.
I started at age 9 with an
almost militant devotion
to conscious hip hop (I’m
talking Immortal Tech-
nique and Akala on repeat
– a playground activist).
Eventually realising that
my young brain’s appreci-
ation of what these artists
were preaching hinged
on Genius annotations
and YouTube comments,
I rerouted to a more
conventional Felix Music
Editor in the making
listening pallet – indie
and classic rock being my
new forte. Somewhere
along the way though, I
realised that Morrissey is
a piece of shit and that my
pre-self-aware brownness
related in some way to
the idea of paradox –
something ever-present in
mainstream hip hop at the
time, with Kanye having
set the gold-standard for
it in My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy. For a
while then, I went through
the embarrassing phase
the guy who has retired
from arrogantly knowing
all there is to know about
music in general and
instead knowing, appar-
ently, everything there
is to know about hip hop
because I can go from
Lil Uzi to Mos Def, but
that’s just where I’m at
right now. Shameless plug
while I’m on the topic:

Hop Soc! Ha you just read
a long ad.
My name is Martin and
I come from sLOVEnia,
the sunny side of the alps;
the Switzerland of the
Balkans; a place where
traditional music en-
sembles wear something
resembling a mix between
the attire of a court jester
and hunter and the accor-
dion is king (I dare you
to check out the world’s
most played instrumental
song of all time, Na Golici
by a punk phase, before I
moved on to ingesting
copious amounts of
classic rock, first ACDC,
then Led Zeppelin being
my favourite entree (I’m
deliberately choosing to
skip over some of the
blunder years’unmention-
able side dishes).
Coming from a small
country, I went to all the
gigs I could find, at my
peak probably seeing 3-4
concerts a week. In high
school I slowly broadened
my repertoire – Queens
of the Stone Age showed
me there were still good
modern bands making
music, Pink Floyd showed
me the vast boundaries of
rock, and I always had
Beatles for dessert. Never
having quite got into metal
past Kyuss and other
stoner bands, I ventured
via post-punky, new-agey
waters, into modern indie,
and eventually some elec-
trorock bands. This set
me up perfectly to fall in
love with electronic music

the case of a few artists
from my youth whose
early albums define, for
me, the very personal
nostalgic awe music can
inspire). I have also come
to hate every type of
music fan I used to be – I
now listen to “a tonne of
hip hop but a fair mix”
not “everything”. Yes, I
realise the irony of being
by Ansambel Avsenik).
Having been spoon-fed
the same (or shall I say the
only) four Slovenian rock
bands’ music growing
up, my first ten concerts
were probably of the same
band - a post-grunge outfit
called Siddharta, who,
for some reason, were at
one point also quite big in
Poland. This was followed

Hola fellow music
lovers. If you’re reading
this section, it probably
means you’re desperately
trying to overcompen-
sate for studying at
a science-only uni.
Don’t worry we all are.
However, this week I’m
talking about something
even better than music –
me/Guthrie.
I have a diploma
in music performance
& production, quite
possibly the qualification
on my CV I deserve least.
One of the biggest lessons
I learned from this course
was that I’m much better at
playing/listening to music
than I am at creating it. So
now, hopefully not from
a place of envy, I critique
the creators.
I grew up in a house
void of music for the
most part, except piano
and drum lessons/exams
which were fantastic at
sucking the fun out of
music. My ignition was
years of dance, mostly
street, which got me on
board with hip-hop, R&B,
funk, etc. Although, my
obsession started with
Frank Ocean’s Blonde.
Before you say, I’m aware
that I am a stereotype.
My guilty pleasures are
00’s R&B stars (Ne-Yo,
Mario, TLC, etc) and
vaporwave, but I’m lying,
I don’t feel guilty. I don’t
even want to say I listen
to one genre more than
others, because for me if
it’s creative, technically
impressive or engaging
then it’s good music. I like
good music, and I’m sure
we have that in common.
of claiming to listen to
“a bit of everything”,
“everything” being the in-
comprehensibly eclectic
and unoriginal mix of
Radiohead, Childish
Gambino, Bon Iver and
Lupe Fiasco.
Now, in my old age,
I’m wise enough to know
that I don’t know shit. I
like to keep an ear out for
anything fresh-sounding
released by artists I’ve
catalogued up until now

as repetitive sounding in
