T
he Welcome
Fair took place
this Tuesday,
with hundreds
of Imperial’s clubs and
societies (CSPs) and
organisations setting up
stalls across campus to
advertise what they can
offer and welcome new
and returning students.
The Fair is predomi-
nantly administered by
the Union, who book
spaces across the college
and organise the layout of
stalls – and which socie-
ties go where.
The Fair was, however,
disrupted by heavy rain-
fall scattered throughout
the day – particularly in
the afternoon, when a
torrential thunderstorm
broke. Several areas had
a chaotic start as a result.
Some societies with elec-
tronic equipment were left
feeling unable to operate
their stalls, and sports
clubs on the Queen’s
Lawn were soaked in the
deluge. Many CSPs had
it difficult to locate CSPs
they were interested in.
There are mixed reports
about the effect on
signups – several, par-
ticularly in Dalby Court,
say that they recorded
lower numbers than in
previous years. However,
many sports clubs on the
Queen’s Lawn and media
societies on level 3 had
record-breaking signups,
and a Union statement
clarified that there was
actually a 6% increase in
online signups over the
2018 Fair.
CGCU societies in
Dalby were left particu-
larly unhappy with their
results – and one even
ended up buying their own
gazebo on the morning of
the event to try to mitigate
the impact. Many ended
up not attending their
stalls, either unable to
operate their electronics
without cover or not
willing to brave the rain.
Frustration is mainly
directed at the lack of
a proper contingency
plan in the event of rain.
Although the measures
put into place last-minute
were effective for many
CSPs, the Union confirms
that it had no established
contingency plan –
despite the forecast and
the high likelihood of rain
in London in September.
Ross Unwin, the ACC
Chair, commented:
“The general mood
among sports clubs was
pretty high spirited and
the fair was a success
for most clubs; so thanks
statement: “Anyone who
raised a concern with the
Union on the day was
supported. From the many
conversations we had with
CSPs, the vast majority
were satisfied with their
final locations.”
TheUnionfurthernoted
in their statement that a
combination of factors
constrained what was pos-
sible after a shift in their
approach to planning the
event. For example, recent
health and safety audits at
the college necessitated
changes. The Union
President also pointed out
that space for the Fair has
to be rented from college
months in advance – and
so spaces that were visibly
empty could still some-
times not be freely moved
to. He also specified that
for next year there will be
consideration of the need
for contingency plans in
some form.
Furthermore, planning
information from the
Union about the event
came at very short notice
– CSPs were only in-
formed about the location
of their stalls on Friday
the 27th, leaving little
time to develop their own
contingency plans, and
few appear to have been
made aware of the new
constraints on space that
led to changes from pre-
vious years. The briefing
also overlapped with the
Officer Academy. Some
also reported that emails
about requirements for
their stall were not re-
sponded to for weeks, and
that information provided
in the official stall request
sooner, and going forward
will communicate more
readily, with its members.
When we know some-
thing, we should talk to
our clubs sooner. Changes
were made to the way we
organised Welcome this
year, and while things
went fairly smoothly
under the circumstances,
there are obviously
lessons we can learn for
the future.”
The Union’s official
statement echoed this
sentiment: “We will seek
feedback from CSPs and
evaluate fully including
consideration of alterna-
tive configurations and
contingencies as well
as any lessons to be
learned from planning
and information roll out.
We are pleased that CSPs
continue to have very high
levels of engagement and
are sure it will be another
successful term of activi-
ty.”

The Welcome Fair took place on Tuesday the 1st, but was barraged by thunderstorms and a lack of contingency
planning
to all those that were
involved. That being said,
had the thunderstorm
come towards the start
of the fair, the lack of
contingency would have
seriously affected sports
clubs.”
The positive outcome
was corroborated by
Joseph O’Connell-Danes,
the Arts and Entertain-
ment Management Chair,
as well as by the Union’s
“Had the

them to question what the
point of the form was.
Regarding the lack of
communication, Abhijay

“We can hold our hands up
and say the Union should

it difficult to

some on an ad-hoc basis.
Others were led in a mass
exodus led by Union staff;
several Beit Quadrangle
CSPs were relocated to
level three of the Union
