The Son - an intergenerational family drama
T
he Son completes
a loosely related
trilogy in which
each standalone
play focuses on a member
of the family. The first,
The Father, examines the
effects of dementia, and
The Mother discusses
middle-aged angst and
loneliness. This final
play’s focus is, teen
depression. Nicolas, two
years ago a normal, smil-
ing boy, is going through
a turbulent phase after his
parents’ separation and
father’s new family. He’s
irritable, skipping months
of school, lying. He moves
between his mother’s and
father’s house trying to
find a place where he feels
comfortable and wanted,
but there are only so many
options. At some point, it
seems Nicolas is going to
have to take more drastic
actions.
A hundred minutes
with no interval seems
like It could potentially
drag on in places, but I
can assure you that my
attention did not waver
throughout the entire
play. Even at times where
there was no talking, there
was always something
happening on the stage.
Nicolas scribbling across
the wall, throwing stuff
across the room. All this
helped us to comprehend
what his thoughts are,
and serve as a visual
representation of what
was going on inside his
head. This was particu-
larly enhanced due to the
otherwise clean, modern
Parisian set design by
Lizzie Clachan.
The most notable
performance comes from
Laurie Kynaston, who
plays Nicolas. He impres-
sively encapsulates the
essence of a lost teenager;
disillusioned, erratic, ni-
hilistic. He draws you in,
and while we never really
understand him, we feel
for him. John Light also
does a brilliant job as the
father, and his strange mix
of caring and uncaring,
guilty and nonchalant.
Scenes between the two of
these compelling charac-
ters were by far the most
gripping.
Amanda Abbington
and Amaka Okafor, as the
mother and Pierre’s new
wife respectively, are also
strong characters, though
outshone by Kynaston.
This may simply be due to
the way characters them-
selves are written and the
way they are incorporated
into the play rather than
the acting talent (the
mother in particular seems
to be under-written by
Zeller, drifting in and out
randomly and not really
fitting in seamlessly).
But both nonetheless do
a great job in terms of
acting, and of supporting
the work as a whole.
Ultimately, there is no
clear-cut explanation for
the way Nicolas is acting,
and he remains a bit of
an enigma throughout
the entire play, from start
to finish. There is no
analysis and exploration
of the ‘why’, it is simply
a presentation of depres-
sion and its frightening
repercussions, not only
on Nicolas himself, but
on the entire family. The
lack of resolution and
understanding perhaps
makes the whole situation
even more alarming and
heartrending. I commend
the actors for being able
to perform an incredibly
emotionally draining
piece, night after night,
and I highly recommend
going to see this if you
want to be as awed by the
talent as I was.
Faith, Hope and Charity
I
n a community
centre, Hazel (Cecilia
Noble) is preparing
a hot lunch for those
in need in the community.
Mason (Nick Holder) has
just taken over the direc-
tion of the choir, he wants
to give back. Beth (Susan
Lynch), who is having
lunch with her friends,
is fighting the social ser-
vices to get her daughter
out of foster care. There
are leaks in the building.
What will the future give?
You may pick this play
out of curiosity, because of
the rhythm of the title, its
positive notes or because
you read Alexander Zeldin’s
previous critically acclaimed
plays Beyond Caring and
LOVE. You may also pick
this play because you’ve
realised how privileged you
are and want to be more
aware of the inequalities in
the country you are living in.
In any case, if you end up
in this room, you will expe-
rience something powerful,
different from any other play.
It is very uncomfortable at
first with lots of simple,
small-talk dialogues, very
un-play-like. The physical
appearance of the actors
is not one that makes you
dream. It is shocking at first,
the screaming uneasiness in
the movements of the char-
acters, how small they are
trying to make themselves,
how vulnerable they are, is
the opposite of the charisma
you usually come across.
You wonder if they are not
exaggerating, overacting
the class difference in the
way they take as it seems a
bit different to what you are
used to. The room is entirely
lit and you can watch the
public. The difference is
striking, well dressed, con-
centrated, relaxed people,
looking just as uncomforta-
ble as you are feeling.
The stage is amazingly
realistic, with rain falling
outside the window of a
decrepit council-building.
You cannot escape the story
that is unfolding, you are so
close to them now, they sit
within the first row on seats
left purposefully empty.
The paths of people from
different backgrounds cross
here, touching on homeless-
ness, mental illness, old age,
youth and family. There are
some funny moments, there
is a song and melodious
hope that makes you smile.
It’s amazing the resilience
of these characters, how
they care for each other. Yet
society categorizes people
that have been through the
care system or the prison
system, making it harder for
them to fit in as adults. There
is no simple solution to shat-
tered people but the weight
of taking care of your single
mom at 16 is chest-tighten-
ing. The silence of some of
the characters, the mystery
of their past and present
emphasises the hardship and
their strength. Then there
are the ones that are missed,
whose names are part of the
chorus of the characters’
life but ironically embody
the absence of a positive
future. The characters don’t
complain, they get angry and
sad, they try their best to help
each other. You’re not sure if
their sadness or their anger
is more heart-breaking. It
is a challenging perspective
on the social system. The
climax is carried by the
astonishing performance of
Susan Lynch and Cecilia
Noble, drawing tears from
the audience and a standing
ovation at the end. This play
is a raw emotional punch in
the face.
Leaving the theatre and
going back to my com-
fortable life as an Imperial
student, I think that there is
something unique about this
play, something so impactful
and everyone should get the
opportunity to see it. We
live in a society with very
complex issues, this play
helps explain the world we
live in a little better.
