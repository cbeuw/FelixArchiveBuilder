Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back in Concert
F
ilm music: excit-
ing, invigorating,
stunning. It is
absolutely crucial
to creating the atmosphere
in a film – films would
simply not be the same
without it. This is accen-
tuated when the music is
live: somehow, live music
has the ability to lend an
indescribable, tangible
power to a film. This was
very much the case for
the screening of 1980s hit
‘Star Wars: The Empire
Strikes Back (EpisodeV)’.
Part of the Royal Albert
Hall’s ‘Films In Concert’
running till December
2019, the series gives
the audience a chance to
experience classic films
with a live orchestra
accompaniment, all in
the glorious surroundings
of Royal Albert Hall.
One may not necessarily
expect live music to add
that much to the film (after
all, the music is already in
the film, right?) but one
would be most pleasantly
surprised.
When the Philharmonia
Orchestra took to the stage
and started playing John
William’s famous opening
theme, the familiar music
filled the 8000-strong hall
and smiles found their
way onto our faces. There
was something simply
magical as the orchestra
recreated the Oscar-win-
ning soundtrack right in
front of our eyes. The
music filling our ears
called to mind the emo-
tional nostalgia of the
original trilogy, drawing
the audience more into the
iconic film: we laughed,
held our breath, and
breathed sighs of relief as
one.
It was fascinating
to see all the different
instruments involved in
the recreation of the Os-
car-winning soundtrack.
The 6 trombones led the
menacing Darth Vader
theme, whilst the violins
lent a sweet lilting voice
in the tender moments.
Needless to say, the full
orchestra passionately
giving it their all really
added to the beauty of
every moment.
Coordinating a live
soundtrack with the
film as it plays is a real
challenge, for the music
must peak at the right
moment: a moment too
soon and the suspense
and emotion may be lost.
The Philharmonia Or-
chestra did a phenomenal
job of ensuring that the
timings were perfect – an
impressive feat indeed.
Conductor Dirk Brosse,
aided by visual cues
from the tablet screen on
his conductor’s stand,
ensured that every entry
was precise to the second.
I was impressed by the
ability and concentration
of both the orchestra and
conductor to play from
the starting ‘20th Century’
sign to the end credits
(not to mention the sheer
quantity of music!) with
nary a note out of place.
The only small detrac-
tion was the quality of
the sound projection. The
dialogue and other audio
(sans music) were project-
ed from the original film
recording. Whilst overall
acceptable, the relative
levels of the sounds were
occasionally slightly
skewed. Blaster gunfire
was sometimes muted,
and certain characters’
voices were jarringly loud
whereas others had us
straining to make out the
words.
Overall, ‘Star Wars:
The Empire Strikes Back
in Concert’ made for a
most enjoyable evening,
highlighting the beauty of
the epic soundtrack while
taking the audience on
a sentimental trip down
memory lane together.
Further, the quality and
skill of the orchestra is to
be commended: they did a
fantastic job in replicating
the moments of tension
and sweetness, more than
a recorded soundtrack
ever could. I would
thoroughly recommend a
film with a live concert
to everyone – it will not
be an experience that you
will forget.
The ‘Films In Concert’
series, presented by the
Royal Albert Hall, con-
tinues with ‘Skyfall’ (4-5
October), ‘Baahubali’(19
October), ‘Blade Runner’
(25 October), ‘Harry
Potter and the Goblet of
Fire’(1-3 November), and
‘E.T.’(8 December).
You love the movie, you love the music, take it all to the next level and see it in all it’s glory at the Royal Albert Hall.
