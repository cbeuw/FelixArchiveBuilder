Manga at the British Museum
A
sk the uninitiat-
ed what manga
is, and they’ll
probably tell
you something about
“Japanese cartoons with
the big eyes and crazy
hair” or, if you’re my
mum, “Japanese nerd
stuff that’ll turn you into
a shut-in NEET pervert”.
For me, manga and anime
were one of few cultural
touchstones that I could
really connect with when
I moved to England as a
child, the aesthetic a fa-
miliar friend amongst the
alien style and language of
Western media. Through
all the noise of hyperac-
tive toy adverts and shows
about poorly-dressed sea
sponges, the only thing
that I would latch onto was
characters such as Usagi
from Sailor Moon, her big
eyes, crazy hair, and glori-
ous tri-tone sailor outfit a
reminder of a culture I had
left behind. And manga
didn’t stop at being a con-
nection to my past. Later
on, I stumbled upon my
dad’s collection of Ranma
½, Rumiko Takahashi’s
gender-bending comedy
epic, which helped inform
my conception of identity
and gender itself. This
culture-spanning, char-
acter-defining property
of manga was the focus
on the British Museum’s
manga exhibition which
opened at the end of May.
The introductory
exhibits were mainly
used as a way of orienting
those unfamiliar to the
manga format, offering
helpful hints such as panel
reading order and even a
beginner’s guide to the
“grammar” of manga
from the book Giga Town:
album of manga symbols.
These symbols, called
“manpu” (or mampu de-
pending on romanisation)
are so embedded into the
vocabulary of most manga
readers that it was actually
refreshing to be offered
a semiotic analysis of
iconography that was
previously processed sub-
consciously (here’s a free
dissertation idea, you’re
welcome). What followed
were sections describing
everything manga related,
from history to genre to
wider applications. These
were exemplified with
awe-inspiring original
hand-drawn images from
popular manga, some of
which were so expertly
crafted they could pass as
digital renderings even at
close viewing.
As expected of a British
Museum offering, there’s
an emphasis on history,
with key artists such as
Tezuka Osamu (“God of
Manga” and creator of
Astro Boy) and Hokusai
(famed ukiyo-e painter
and printmaker) taking
key mentions. Fortunate-
ly, a whole diverse cast of
other mangaka also get a
chance to shine, with their
key works on display and
a panel introducing them
in flashcard format. Not
only did we get photos and
place of work, we were
also treated to quotes from
the artists, such as Chiba
Tetsuya (Tomorrow’s Joe)
“You don’t want people
to read your manga, you
want them to feel it”;
interesting facts, such
as Akika Higashimura’s
(Princess Jellyfish) love
of growing succulents;
and even their blood
group. The inclusion of
blood typing may seem
like an odd piece of extra-
neous information, but for
anyone who has ever read
a manga character bio, it
is a piece of information
that comes as easily to
the Japanese character
make-up as star sign or
favourite food. And like a
star sign or favourite food,
the blood typing is consid-
ered an important indica-
tor of personality as based
on the “Japanese Blood
Type Personality Theory”
(watch Ketsuekigata-kun!
for more information).
The only major source
of disappointment of this
exhibition came down to
the lack of space. Touted
as the “largest exhibition
of manga ever to take
place outside of Japan”,
one would expect an
endless pavilion of manga
charm. Unfortunately, the
exhibition hall was not
the size such a collection
warranted. Add to that
the immense popularity
of the exhibition and
the “largest exhibition”
suddenly feels positively
claustrophobia-inducing.
It’s safe to say that any
statement relating to size
is really a matter of rela-
tivity and I should know
better by now than to be
drawn in by such boasts.
However, given the space
limitations, the exhibition
did remarkably well in
fitting in all a long-time
fan or a beginner would
want to see.
These exhibitions can
often come off as rather
entry-level, especially
when this exhibition
was designed to capture
the widest audience as
possible. And play to the
crowds it did. Not only
was there a whole section
dedicated to Studio
Ghibli, there was also a
life-sized titan head from
Attack on Titan, and a
library of manga volumes
to peruse at your leisure.
However, the true strength
of the exhibition was
its readiness to proudly
display the often bizarre
and overlooked aspects
of manga culture, from
mangaka blood typing
to original, hand-painted
Shintomi Theatre stage
curtains. These smaller
touches and more obscure
asides, like big eyes and
crazy hair in my younger
years, were helpful reas-
surances that I had found
my space. Sorry mum, it
looks like you’re going
to end up with a shut-in
NEET pervert for a son
and you have the British
Museum to thank.
