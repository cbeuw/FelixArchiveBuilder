G
reta seems
to troll the
President with
new bio.’ This
was the way the Guardian
chose to cover the fallout
from a speech made by 16
year old climate change
activist Greta Thunberg
to world leaders at the
United Nations: Climate
Action Summit. Thank
God twitter activists have
a new icon to idolise. It’s
all that this summer of
climate change protests
needed: a young, middle
class girl with a little bit
of Autism and a lot of
anger. She’s untouchable,
but I’m worried that the
idolatry only serves to
obscure her message.
If you can dodge the
proclamations of her as a
messiah, or the desperate
mudslinging from her
opponents, you might
just find the message she
broadcasted to the world
at the UN. Which was
something about climate
change. I think. It’s
difficult to tell when all
her supporters will tweet
about is how her oppo-
nents are tweeting about
how Thunberg’s tweets
are ‘immature’ and ‘not a
good way to approach an
issue as serious as climate
change.’
Truthfully, if I read one
more tweet about Thun-
berg’s clap back at Trump
I might vomit. However,
this sort of response will
not come as a surprise to
anyone who has noticed
the recent shift in online
discussion to some
Nietzschean nightmare.
As with many important
issues that have come
axe that wants grinding.
Rising sea levels are
blamed on the rich and
strangled turtles are
ascribed to male fragility.
I understand the feeling
of impotence, but I do
not think that using the
facts of climate change
to make these points will
do anything but dilute the
message.
Worryingly, this is just
another step in the transi-
tion from politics into en-
tertainment. Interactions
such as the one between
Thunberg and Trump are
now commonplace, and
it’s only getting worse.
Unfortunately it’s an
incredibly useful distrac-
tion tool for leaders like
Trump, who use social
media to direct attention
to whatever serves them
best. The use of social
media in political discus-
sion has brought serious
debate down to the level
of reality TV. By existing
alongside anyone’s mean-
ingless diatribe, issues that
require nuanced discus-
sion become plot points
in a bizarre, multi-episode
story-arc. This is the price
we have paid for full de-
mocracy in debate, and we
must change something
before politics turns into
yet another reality show
that plays out on our TV
screens every night.
I should mention here
that I fully believe that
more urgent action is
needed to mitigate the
damage that climate
change will inevitably
cause. I also fully support
anyone who is brave
enough to stand in front
of the world and bring
this issue to the attention
of so many. But who
hasn’t heard of climate
change by now? Deniers
have long since become
cartoon strawmen, oc-
cupying the same niche
as anti-vaxxers and the
Nazis. And just like with
measures were not good
enough, she chose to
reference very little of
the science that backs up
her claims, nor did she
provide any solutions in
her speech.
Despite this, there is
now no denying that the
message she brings is
an important one. The
effect human industry has
had on the planet is now
undeniable. I am a huge
fan of the urgency she
brings to every speech. As
with most bureaucracy,
emotion might be what
will finally encourages
further action. The facts
are dry and boring, and
may no longer further
this movement. Protests
and speeches of this
nature have been all too
peaceful, this is clear by
the sluggish inaction. This
is not to say that rioting is
the way forward. In fact,
violence would be very
bad for the image. I’m
just surprised that more
people aren’t more angry
with the slothful crawl
that progress seems to
move with.
Martin Luther King Jr
once denounced ‘white
moderates’ as the real
enemy of progress;
that the greatest enemy
was not the Klansman,
but the white man who
‘paternalistically set the
timetable for another
man’s freedom.’ I think
we face a similar issue.
What stands in the way of
progress is not people who
deny that there is an issue,
but those who believe that
‘technical solutions’ are
enough. When framed
like this, the frustration
and impotence that many
young people are now
feeling is justified.

the vaccine argument,
the goal of discussion
has moved away from
persuasion and towards
confirming to your tribe
that you’re one of the
‘good’ ones. Vilifying the
opposition view is not
how you change minds.
Who then, was Thun-
berg’s speech in aid of?
Either you already share
her fears of impending
doom, or you disagree
that climate change is
such an urgent issue. If it’s
the latter, how convincing
is Thunberg’s argument?
While she did mention the
world’s remaining CO2
budget and that current
