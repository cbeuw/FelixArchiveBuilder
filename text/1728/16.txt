Blood Wedding
What Girls Are Made Of
P
rior to seeing this
production, I was
worried. Having
been informed
that the play, one of
Lorca’s “trilogy of the
Spanish earth”, had been
reimagined to take place
in Ireland, I thought I was
in for a brutal disappoint-
ment. However, I was in
for a pleasant surprise.
The exact location of
the play is uncertain, but
ultimately irrelevant. Not
only is the play not neces-
sarily set in Ireland, after
much soul-searching, I’ve
come to the realisation
that the Irish flair adds
to the magic of Lorca’s
Anadulsian tragedy.
Adapted skilfully by
Marina Carr using her
native Hibernian English,
still spoken in parts of
Ireland, this alteration
could have easily been
distracting and confusing.
However, the conver-
sations flow with such
fluency and ease that the
production feels like a
blueprint for how Lorca’s
masterpiece should be
performed in English.
Added by the fact that the
play did maintain its The
distinct Spanish feel of the
play is maintained through
the music and spoken
poetry - a plethora of
Spanish music, Flamenco
beats and poems mostly
performed in Spanish. The
blend of Irish and Spanish
elements combine to
create a mind-bogglingly
timeless, placeless feel.
This is a truly gorgeous
production – no line is un-
intentional; no movement
is less than a hundred
percent precise. The
simple staging never feels
empty, and the almost-
in-the-round seating plan
creates a sense of entrap-
ment of the characters on
stage. There are moments
of absolute visual genius
within the performance –
namely when Leonardo,
portrayed tantalisingly
by Gavin Drea, rides an
imaginary horse, gliding
through the air, hooked
on a harness from the
top of the stage. The
music also adds greatly
to the performance. The
efficient use of music
creates a constant sense of
urgency, and the wailings
of The Moon, expertly
played by Thalissa
Teixeira, although for
the most part in Spanish,
feel emotionally charged
in all the right moments.
Teixeira’s voice is a
complete marvel, filling in
the auditorium to the brim
every time she opened
her mouth. But perhaps
the most valuable asset of
the play is its wonderful
portrayal of the Mother,
absolutely brilliantly per-
formed by Olwen Fouéré,
building and dissipating
tension with razor-sharp
precision.
This production is
bound to be polarising –
some, like me, will marvel
at what Yaël Farber, the
director, was able to
achieve through such an
unconventional approach.
However, it is not less
than probable that purists
will leave The Young Vic
feeling slightly attacked.
The only criticism I can
think of about this mas-
terful production of Blood
Wedding is that I would
have liked to see a more
fully realised collection
of the brutality of Lorca’s
original play. Farber’s
perhaps intentionally
tame version, comes just
slightly short of provoking
discomfort in the viewers.
Overall, though, regard-
less of one’s familiarity
with Lorca’s work, most
viewers will leave the
theatre with something
to take away from this
evocative production.
W
hat Girls
Are Made
Of is a
d e e p l y
introspective and yet
refreshingly playful
performance written by
and starring Cora Bissett:
the (almost famous)
lead singer of the 90s
indie-band ‘Darlingheart’.
Fresh from its sold-out
run in the Edinburgh
Fringe and now being
performed in the Soho
Theatre, Bissett breathes
her teenage diary to life
and delicately charts her
journey. We see her as a
17-year-old girl living in a
small Scottish town, high
on youth and ambition,
and watch her transform
into a shimmering singer,
partying and touring the
UK with Radiohead.
‘What Girls are Made
of’ is a fun, exciting
musical – it will have
you nodding your head
and humming the songs
on the tube back home.
However, underneath its
fun, gig-style delivery
remains Bissett’s poignant
reflection. The narrative
is constructed thought-
fully, with themes of
parenthood, loss, betrayal
and confusion threaded
throughout. Bissett’s
singing is powerful,
her stage presence is
commanding, and yet the
most moving aspect of her
performance is her ability
to reflect. The audience
doesn’t just witness a girl
growing up and becoming
a singer. Far from a
simplistic coming-of-age
arc, ‘What Girls Are
Made Of’ exhibits the
complex iterative process
of reflection undertaken
by Bissett as she digests
her own experiences. The
result is stunning: we see
the various forms Bissett
has been incarnated in
throughout her life. We
see her as not just as the
woman in front of us, but
as the girl she once was
and the woman she will
later grow up to be.
The songs and perfor-
mance are fast-paced.
Scattered throughout the
ballads and rock anthems,
Bissett creates moments
of both comedic and emo-
tional gold, presenting
a true testament to her
writing and versatility on
stage. Accompanying,
and by no means over-
shadowed by, Bisset is
her dynamic 3-person
live band. The cast put
on an energetic show
with singing, guitar solos,
fantastic drumming and
hilarious impersonations
of the eccentric people
Bissett meets along her
journey. I must add that
their Scottish accents do
make some jokes and
lyrics hard to decipher,
despite this, the cast will
still have you laughing
out loud, singing along
and (at times) shedding a
tear or two.
The Soho Theatre
offers an intimate venue
for the performance. The
room is filled with light
theatre smoke, thin neon
tubes outline the stage
and the cast are wearing
exactly what you would
expect them to wear if
they were rehearsing in
their basement. The set
design is simple, but rather
than appearing reductivist
the set-up feels charming
and familiar, resonant of
a student union or school
production.
Prior to seeing this
show I had no knowledge
of Cora Bissett, of her
band or any of her songs.
Despite this, the cast’s
energy and Bissett’s
heart-warming vulnerabil-
ity create a truly fantastic
show with a powerful
message of self-reflection
– 5 stars, a show not to be
missed.
