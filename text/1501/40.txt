American Football
The Imperial American Football team
had a convincing victory last Sunday
in its first game of the season; crush-
ing the Surrey Stingers 46-6. This re-
sult has put the Immortals at the top
of the Thames Valley league table for
the first time in their history, ahead of
more established teams such as Ports-
mouth.
The game started well, the Immor-
tals winning the toss and choosing to
return the ball. From their own 15-
yard line the starting offense drove the
ball up the field. Using a combination
of running and the first pass-play of
the game the Immortals forced the ball
into the Stingerâ€™s red-zone, finishing
off the drive with a powerful run by
Tino Millar to score the first touch-
down of the game. Rookie player Max
Stubenvoll stepped forward to score
the field goal conversion to take the
Immortals into a 7-0 lead.
The Immortals Defense then took
the field and dominated the Surrey
Offence; making tackle after tackle in
the backfield and forcing the Stingers
to punt. This allowed the offense back
on the field who took the ball back
into the Surrey red-zone for the start
of the second quarter. This was where
the Immortals really took control of
the game, with Rob Wolstenhome
and Tino Millar scoring a touchdown
each with the aid of some impressive
power-blocks by O-linemen: Jordan
Douglas and Joe Downey dominating
the Surrey nose-tackle. Unfortunately
both touchdowns failed to convert
