I
’d like to begin by expressing
my gratitude for the time and ef-
fort put in by a good few people
a couple of weeks ago in response
to my first foray into the world of
Felix. I was very happy to see that many
had read the article and gone to huge
lengths to attempt some form of critique.
As always, I aim to please, so here we
go again.
I must admit that I wasn’t expecting
to have to bother writing about the so-
called ‘Occupy’ movement. These dem-
onstrations come and go, and in my mind
this was yet another misguided attempt
by another bunch of loony lefties to
wreak havoc in the lives of honest, hard-
working, and upstanding members of so-
ciety. But with the protest now in its 27th
day, and with no sign that anybody is tak-
ing decisive and effective action to have
them evicted (and locked up), I am afraid
that I must seek to bemoan the appalling
situation we now find ourselves in.
It seems there is somewhat of a trend
when it comes to socialist protests: a per-
vasive hypocrisy amongst its supporters.
Take this one: the police recently did a
thermal study of the camp at St Paul’s
at night, only to find that the majority
of protesters weren’t, in fact, braving
the elements in the name of their cause,
but had instead opted for the comfort of
their own beds at home. Whilst by the
day they preach a vacuous anti-capitalist
creed, by night they would rather desert
their cause and take advantage of their
own, no doubt privately owned, homes,
a product of the capitalist system they
appear to deride. I would also venture
to suggest that they used the railway
system to get home, another social ser-
vice produced by rampant capitalism.
Essentially, what they are doing is not
protesting, but simply littering central

What’s the point again?
Protest is sacred, hypocrisy is really not
London. Their expensive tents should be
re-appropriated and given to homeless
people. At least the homeless would get
some use out of them.
So we continue to be subjected to pic-
tures in newspapers, day in, day out, of
protesters prancing around in their V for
Vendetta masks, getting hideously drunk
(I don’t have any problem with this real-
ly!), vomiting in the street, and generally
being uncouth. The scene is akin to one
of those ghastly hovels that the travel-
ling (aka under) class seem to call home,
and smells worse than Louis XIV’s last
bowel movement. In short, the occupa-
tion does little more than express some
unfounded rage against the rich. To be
honest, the whole thing is farcical. But
then again, so is socialism.
I would probably be unwise to sug-
gest here that there shouldn’t be a right
to protest (no doubt some immature 1st
year computing student would have a
problem with that…). And to be honest,
whilst I often disagree with the reason
behind most protests (partly due to the
dullards who frequent them), the right
to free speech should be as enshrined in
our culture and constitution as the place
of public schools in the education sector.
I do, however, disagree fundamentally
with simply occupying a public area for
such an extended period of time. It’s an
eyesore, and after a few days, just gets
boring. One of the reasons London is
such an interesting place is the hustle and
bustle: a continually changing landscape;
not the deplorable view of a bunch of ig-
norant left wing campers. By all means
have a march, or go stand outside Par-
liament for an afternoon, but don’t spoil
everybody’s view of a magnificent piece
of architecture for the sake, it seems, of
some debunked 19th century ideology.
Indeed, the whole debacle is making
O
n the other word tab
there’s a lab summary
waiting for me, so my
eagerly procrastinating
brain suggested that I
write a bit about a question I’ve been
pondering for some time. I’m sure some
of you have been wondering over and
over again as well… What’s the point of
Twitter again?
I’ve thought about this ever since I
heard about it first… it’s just like texting
to the world, telling the world what mu-
sic you’re listening to, or reading about
that burger some celebrity just ate – so
how exactly is that interesting? If any-
thing, Facebook served that purpose
quite sufficiently (and indeed, many
celebrities have hooked up their Twitter
to their Facebook page). Surely, Twitter
seems a bit more personal, but still, it
doesn’t seem necessary at all. That was
all a while ago, and I’ve kind of set the
thoughts aside for a bit, but earlier this
week, something happened that brought
it all back to me… I signed up for Twit-
ter as well.
I had been thinking about joining a few
months back already, but not seeing the
point, I refrained. I now suddenly found
myself presented with my own personal
Twitter page, without being able to name
any reasons or motivations to join. On
Facebook, I’m kind of a spectator, hard-
ly posting anything myself. I mostly just
reading what other people are up to and
writing the occasional message or wall
post. However, I found myself, well, not
tweeting away, but certainly quickly get-
ting addicted to reading tweets of my fa-
vourite artists and posting more on Twit-
ter over the last few days than I posted
on Facebook over the last few weeks. I
feel the ‘magic’of Twitter, but it remains
a mystery to me. What is so fascinating
about little fragments of life other people
send off into the world, or telling your
own (in my case, virtually non-existent)
audience what you’re up to? I’m even
a part of the minority that doesn’t own
a smartphone, so my trusty laptop re-
mains as the only option to checking
the timeline. The mysterious attraction
of Twitter will probably be on my mind
a mockery of not only our legal system
in being unable to promptly clear the site
(apparently it could take up to nine years
to clear the steps of St Paul’s) but also of
our law enforcement efforts. But, return-
ing to the hypocrisy mentioned earlier:
doesn’t the clear dishonesty of the whole
movement come to the fore when camp-
ers threaten to ‘prepare violence’ whilst
continue to use the law to prevent (or at
least delay) their inevitable eviction. Is it
not more than hypocritical to use the law
when it suits them, but defy it when it
doesn’t?
The protests are an embarrassment.
It is costing local traders thousands of
pounds each day in revenue, tarnishing
the name of the Church of England, and
showing the world, once again, that Lon-
don, and indeed the United Kingdom,
can so easily be held to ransom by an ig-
norant minority: whether this be by trav-
ellers, protesters, unions, or the basest of
people: squatters (more on this another
time…).
This blatant flouting of the law (they
are in fact camped on a public highway)
should be put to an end immediately.
The protesters are no more above the
law than the banks they decry. They
are breaking rules on public order and
should be removed. So to anybody read-
ing this whilst encamped on the steps of
St Paul’s: go home, buy a suit, and get a
proper job.
for some time, maybe without ever fig-
uring it out. If you’ve been in the same
situation, have figured it out or want to
think about it with me, or you just want
to watch me trying to find the answer,
have a look at: twitter.com/vocalnerd –
and thanks for reading!
Some say that the addition of a mask has made the new ‘Where’s Wally?’
too easy. Standards are slipping everywhere it seems
