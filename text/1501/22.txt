It’s an unusual setting for Capdown’s
final gig, skin heads and punks looking
incredibly out of place in the theatrical
grandeur of KOKO. For years these
veterans of the UK ska scene (and per-
haps the only good thing ever to come
out of Milton Keynes) have toured the
country’s basements, only now, at the
end, getting the recognition and large
scale venues they deserve.
Up and coming stars of UK scene,
The Skints provide an excellent
warm up set, throwing in numerous
classic ska tracks among their own
East London reggae stylings. Here is
a band certainly fit to takeover where
Capdown leave off but in my eyes it’s
all about the headliners tonight.
Finally at 9pm Capdown storm the
stage, a single opening sax riff setting
the crowd in immediate motion. They
may have returned from hiatus but the
Capdown
KOKO
November 6, 2011
Capitalist downfall
band who famously played over 250
gigs in a year have clearly lost none of
their live edge.
Unsurprisingly (and much to the
crowd’s delight), older tracks such as
‘Ska Wars’ and ‘Cousin Cleotis’ form
the majority of the set but even tunes
from the lesser acclaimed ‘Wind Up
Toys’ album get a final seeing off, still
generating roars from the crowd and
sizeable circle pits.
As you would expect from a last
gig, crowd interaction is top priority
and vocalist Jake does not disappoint,
at one point splitting the crowd and
making his way into the middle before
disappearing amongst a horde of fans
from both sides of a charging wall of
death.
When it’s all over genuine sadness
appears to take over the crowd, the fi-
nal gig of a band I grew up with is cer-
tainly momentous. Then again I was
there at home in MK for the previous
‘last ever’ gig. I’ll always have my
fingers crossed. Caution: angles may induce torticollis

album of the week
Real Estate
Days
2011
It was cold this morning, wasn’t it? Like most stu-
dents, myself included, you’re probably a bit suspi-
cious of the thermostat and slightly paranoid that
if you turn the heating on your next gas bill will be
enough to bankrupt you. (I’m not talking about you,
“1%” students; you know who you are…)
The summer is dead and we’re quickly approach-
ing those days where you get to the library before
it’s light and leave well after the pathetic sun has
scuttled off in fear of the overwhelming dark.
But there is some hope in the face of this Novem-
ber malaise; Real Estate’s second album, Days.
It’s happy in a rueful sense; a chilled out, surfer-
rock ode to the summer that’s stopped answering
our calls. It washes over you with simple, wander-
ing lyrics about the kind of love that only really ex-
ists in nostalgic hindsight (preferably while wearing
chunky black hipster glasses…)
Admittedly the album doesn’t require a lot of hard
work to get into it. But as much as music snobs
want to believe that all the best albums require “re-
peat listens”, Days works just as well in the back-
ground as it does when you need music to tease
out feelings that you can’t otherwise verbalize.
If you’re feeling cold this week and need a cuddle,
tweet me @kadhimshubber. A better idea would be
to tweet @BritishGas and say, “Dude, it’s like cold
and shit. Like, what the fuck?”
In 2009, I received a copy of Tru Thoughts’ Tenth
Anniversary album and although I was slightly em-
barrassed at the fact that it took me ten years
to notice them, it was musically one of the best
things that’s ever happened to me.
Tru Thoughts is a gem of a label, nestled down in
Brighton on the south coast. In just over a decade
they’ve established themselves as one of the lead-
ing independent record labels in the UK. Founders
Robert Luis and Paul Jonas have always had a keen
ear for talented artists who mix styles from jazz and
soul, to house and techno, to calypso and salsa.
Next Saturday, Tru Thoughts are taking over
KOKO and bringing with them the finest artists on
their roster. The globe-trotting record store-fiend
Quantic will be DJiing (expect records that God
himself doesn’t know exist...) and Nostalgia 77
and Belleruche will also be gracing the stage. If
all that doesn’t persuade you, Robert Luis has
made a special mix-cd for the night and is giving
it away free on the night. See you there!

KABLAAM
K
ABLAAM is finally upon
us! Tomorrow night will
see Metric filled with
the warm sound of Im-
perial’s bustling under-
ground. Come down to the Union for an
exhibition of the musical talents of Jazz
& Rock and Music Tech societies, one
of IC Radio’s sweetest DJs and one of
the moddest rappers of the East London
scene.
The night will be an even mix of bands
and DJs from our own student body.
Starting off, SMB will warm things up
with a tangy slice of nouveau disco and
deep house. The dualist meanderings of
lo. batt. / algo ritmico’s experimental
improvisation, A Gap in Nature, will
set the tone for the evening’s live per-
formances. Black Sands will play their
first gig since the release of their debut
EP That’s Not So Magnetic, a 4-pack of
scorching indie swagger, followed by
Operation Midnight Climax’s cocktail
of explosive rock and progressive ska.
Headlining, hip-hop hating MC Mikill
Pane will storm the stage with a flurry
of puns and vocal swerves to get your
Broca’s area all hot and bothered.
Monsk’s milky smooth beat selections
will set the after party off in high spirits,
followed by the frantic bass of the un-
fuckwithable Niceberg.
£3, three bands, three DJs and one
heady headliner. Get upon it.
