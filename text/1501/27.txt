Have a fashion fling online
The crème de la crème of the online fashion community is at your fingertips
,
Susanna Lau (aka Susie
Bubble) is undoubtedly
Britain’s most followed
fashion blogger. The Lon-
don-based 28-year-old,
who once wrote about
sneaking into fashion
week shows, claiming, “If
you’re ballsy enough to
act like you’re somebody,
SOMEONE’s gonna fall for
it eventually,” now graces
many front rows and is
often granted backstage
access to photograph her
favourite details. Despite
consciously leaving out
celebrities as inspirational
fashion figures in her writ-
ing, her own celeb status
is global.
Her blog, launched in
March 2006, is a personal
online diary: a collection of
her daily thoughts on the
latest fashion events and
new collections, alongside
where she is, what she’s
doing, and, most impor-
tantly, what she’s wearing.
While big names (such as
Prada and Balenciaga) pop
up from time to time, Su-
sie loves to expose under-
the-radar talent from fresh
designers. Photography
plays a large role in every
post, whether it’s outfits
(snapped by her boyfriend,
fellow blogger of Style Sal-
vage, on their famous Hol-
loway balcony) or general
inspiration posts.
Her personal avant-garde
style is impossible to cat-
egorise, though a minimal-
ist she certainly is not. She
mixes an eclectic collec-
tion of vintage, high street
and independent designer
pieces, layering contrast-
ing patterns, textures and
colours. While her style is
constantly evolving, her
signature blunt fringe and
innocent expression re-
main constant. She often
uses her legs as her best
accessory, whether they’re
bare, or covered with
opaques; she maintains
her winter staple is a pair
of John Lewis school uni-
form ribbed grey tights.
The blog also includes
her famous ‘London Shop
Map’, an extensive guide to
London’s unique shopping
experience, which includes
everything from depart-
ment store favourites like
Selfridges and Liberty, and
designers like Acne and
Marc Jacobs, to East Lon-
don vintage boutiques and
Kensington charity shops.
As a brand in her own right,
she has associations with
recognisable names such
as Elle and Topshop, whilst
never forgetting the impor-
tance of blogs. During her
time writing for Dazed and
Confused, she confessed
to checking up to 250 a
day.

In these tough times when
the student budget is be-
ginning to drain and the
days look clouded with
educational bleakness,
those of us with a spark of
creative appreciation pre-
fer to scoff on inspirational
works as opposed to chips
or chocolate. Unfortunate-
ly, it is on days like these,
when we most crave the
glossy pages of the likes
of Vogue, i-D and Numero,
that we are faced with the
daunting reality that these
monthlies are no longer
affordable, thanks to our
latest shopping extrava-
ganza.
As a result, we turn trust-
ingly to our good friend,
the internet. Amongst
all those girls prancing
around so casually and
perfectly in high fashion
events looking every bit
the epitome of what we
envy, and all those sites
linked to those physical
publications we so des-
perately desire, cries out a
spark of excitement in the
online magazine.
Online magazines are
typically devoid of any con-
tent worth our precious
procrastination time due
to a lack of funding and
exposure, except in the
case of The Ones 2 Watch.
In fact, as the little sister
of the online fashion giant
MODELS.com, the popular-
ity The Ones 2 Watch has
gained since it launched
a year ago has bought
hoards of contributors who
are nothing less than awe
inspiring, talented, cre-
ative geniuses.
Each monthly issue is
filled with unexpected orig-
inality. A hunger for beauty
and perfection is the only
thing in common through-
out each issue despite a
monthly set theme. Take,
for example, September’s
issue ‘Stay Beautiful’
which evokes nothing less
than pure love towards an
alluring Paul Boche in the
calmly surreal shoot ‘Pale
& Interesting’, contrasted
against the yearning for ex-
travagant luxury provoked
by the image of models
drowning in the pleasure of
their own reflection in ‘The
Royal Palace’.
In fact, The Ones 2
Watch has turned into
somewhat of a guilty plea-
sure. Their aim was to
showcase upcoming tal-
ent from across the globe,
and they have succeeded
without pretentiousness,
giving just enough to set
your thoughts ablaze, al-
lowing the imagination to
run wild, almost as if in the
knowledge that we want
nothing less than a total
escape.

As a follower of fashion
blogs since they first ap-
peared on the industry’s
radar some five years ago,
I confess I have become
something of a blog-snob.
Personal style blogs are
now ten to the dozen, with
hundreds of wannabe Rumi
Neelies and Jane Aldridges
clogging up the blogroll of
those whose interest is
in the close observation
of beautiful, modelesque
girls with perfect hair and
deeply enviable ward-
robes. And if your interest
sways towards capturing
the everyday moments of
sartorial glory, the holy
trinity of street-style re-
mains: Scott Schuman
(thesartorialist.com), Ga-
rance Doré (garancedore.
fr/en) and Tommy Ton
(jakandjil.com), whose hal-
lowed cameras point only
at the select super-stylish
few, though presently the
field is congested with
DSLR-owners whose taste
doesn’t yet quite cut the
sartorial mustard. There
is now an established elite
within the blogosphere,
which some would say
defeats the object of blog-
ging – it is, after all, about
individuals sharing ideas in
a free, public forum. Alas,
such is the nature of the in-
dustry: elitism omnia vincit.
So imagine my delight
when I find (on Tumblr, of
all things!) a blog with a
truly unique vision: Text-
book. A style blog for his-
tory and literature. The
premise? Each post is a
stylish imagining of what
a fictional, historical or
even a video game char-
acter would wear if they
were living today. The au-
thor, John Jannuzzi, works
at Lucky magazine in New
York, but the project is
quite apart from his day
job. He writes: “Ever read
a book and formed a per-
fect image of the charac-
ter in your head? So have
I, and that’s why I started
this blog.” Simply put, one
by one, the Jannuzzi puts
every well-known character
imaginable in a selection
of three fantastic edito-
rial ensembles: there’s
Anne Boleyn in Alexander
McQueen, Dorian Gray in
Dolce and Gabanna, Belle
of Beauty and the Beast
in Erdem and, a personal
favourite, Lady Macbeth in
Givenchy, with the byline:
“Duncan is here for din-
ner...”
A blog for all the sarto-
rially fabulous who could
imagine that, of course,
if Rasputin were alive and
fashion-forward today, he
would totally be wearing
Rick Owens. I mean, obvi-
ously.
