More resignations in
the Eurozone
The socialist Prime Minister of Greece,
George Papandreou, finally made a deal
with opposition conservatives for a uni-
ty government and acceptance of the Eu-
ropean bailout deal, in exchange for him
standing down. His previous decision
to call a referendum on the deal, which
caused rapid decline in markets and an-
ger from other European leaders and op-
position parties in Greece, was scrapped.
So far, the parliament has failed to agree
on a new prime minister and general
elections are likely to be held in Febru-
ary. Reaction from papers throughout
the European Union and Greece was
generally positive, though cautious, but
popular protest action shows no sign of
waning in Greek cities.
Meanwhile, in Italy, Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi promised to resign
in the near future. He finally bowed
to pressure from many of his former
allies in the Italian media and by the
head of his main coalition partner,
Umberto Bossi. Many are still,
however, sceptical of his sincerity.
The markets, in particular, have not
shown much faith, with Italian bond
yields remaining at a damaging high
of 7.5%. Like Greece, the Italian
government is coming under pressure
to form a unity coalition and accept
a reform package from the European
Union. Mr Berlusconi has so far
refused a major bailout plan despite
Italian debt standing at 120% GDP. To
make matters worse, with the majority
of this debt being held by private
institutions within Italy itself,
the 50% debt ‘haircut’
Greece received from its
creditors may not be
helpful in Italy.
More land
wars in
Asia
A report to
the UN by the
International
Atomic Energy
Agency found
that Iran is
likely to not only
be developing
computer models,
but also testing key
components for a
nuclear arsenal including
warheads. The Supreme
Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei,
issued a fatwa against such weapons
in 2005 and President Ahmadinejad
has said his country does not need the
weapons. Despite this, rumours are
circulating of a full scale war. Israel
this week tested ballistic missiles with
enough range to reach Iran, though Iran
also possesses such weapons. The Daily
Mail claimed that a plan drawn up by
David
C a m e r o n and Barack
Obama, the leaders of Britain and the
United States, involved an invasion on
two fronts – from Iraq in the West and
Afghanistan in the East. The President
of France, Nicholas Sarkozy, denied
such plans existed, though both he and
China condemned Iran’s “obsession”
with nuclear weapons. China,
however, continues to sell non-
atomic weapons to Iran, and
Western diplomats have
told The Telegraph
that they expect
China and Russia
to veto any
new sanctions
p r o p o s e d
at the UN.
Britain, the
US, France,
China and
Russia make
up the veto-
h o l d i n g
permanent
m e m b e r s
of the UN’s
S e c u r i t y
Council and all
possess nuclear
weapons. Israel
may also have
nuclear weapons ,
though refuses to admit it.
Despite agreeing to a
diplomatic ceasefire deal, the
President of Syria, Bassar Al-Assad,
has continued the military campaign
against militants, with particularly
brutal attacks on the city of Homs,
though he continues to deny this. The
Arab League, who negotiated the deal,
condemned his actions. The protests,
which started in the spring, initially
Rajat Jain
involved unarmed protesters continuing
to face military gunfire. With Western
powers showing no zeal for a Libya-
style intervention and Al-Assad refusing
to negotiate, the rebellion is becoming
increasingly militant. It is thought that
Syria could be heading for a civil war.
Al-Assad has continued to claim that
the rebels are “terrorists” supplied with
weapons by secretive foreign powers
trying to destroy Syria.
More Presidential
Gaffes
The Presidents of the United States and
France were overheard insulting the
Prime Minister of Israel. Discussing the
French decision to support Palestine’s
membership to UNESCO, Sarkozy said
“I cannot stand [Netanyahu]… he’s a
liar” to which Obama replied “You’re
fed up with him? I have to deal with
him every day.” Benjamin Netanyahu
has been rumoured to be a particularly
unpopular Israeli leader among Western
leaders, refusing to negotiate on giving
up East Jerusalem or stopping the
building of illegal settlements.
The Republican frontrunner for the
president of the United States, Herman
Cain, claimed China does not have any
nuclear weapons in an interview on
PBS. Despite being a strong candidate
on domestic issues, there are concerns
that his understanding of foreign policy
is rather limited.
A couple of weeks ago, at the
Commonwealth summit in Perth,
the sixteen leaders of countries
where Elizabeth II is head of state
unanimously agreed to change the
succession laws to give women equal
priority as men. This means should the
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (aka
Wills and Kate) have a daughter before
any sons, she will be eligible for the
throne before her younger brothers.
It will also allow any monarch, or
anyone else in the succession line, to
marry a Catholic without losing their
right to the throne. A retroactive clause
has been added to prevent hundreds
of pretenders to the throne from
emerging.
Nick Clegg, the ‘highly regarded’
deputy Prime Minister, was in charge
of negotiations with other states and
described the previous system as
“old fashioned”, saying we need to
move with the times. David Cameron
echoed this describing it as “outdated
and wrong”. He, however, made it
clear that in their role as protector of
the Church of England, they must be
Anglican but can marry whoever they
like. This move, though seemingly an
obvious one in the modern world, is a
terrible idea.
You see, the existence of the
monarchy in Britain is rather difficult
to understand. There are benefits
to a House of Commons that is not
proportional (for the sake of having
your own MP representing you
regardless of whether you share a
party), as well as an unelected House
of Lords (a non-populist house of the
wise to improve legislation), but the
Royal Family is bewildering. If we
want to move with the times, shouldn’t
we do away with the monarchy and
elect a president? Should we not also
have full separation of Church and
State? It is beyond belief that Nick
Clegg could describe the House of
Lords as outdated and push for it to
be fully elected, yet see the changes
in succession as somehow progressive
and radical.
The problem is that these views
are driven by ideology. While the
concepts seem good and pure, they are
not practical. The oft cited reason for
keeping the monarchy, alongside many
other British quirks, is stability. Unlike
most of our European neighbours,
Britain has maintained a stable
government for hundreds of years. This
has largely been achieved on a simple
principle: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
The British public demonstrated this
basic belief when they voted against
the Alternative Vote. Given that the
monarchy is operating without any
problem, this is a dangerous move that
threatens to destabilise Britannia. I am
not being sexist or anti-Catholic, but
this law will open the door for changes
to be made to the fundamental structure
of our government on populist whims.
For the sake of Britain, it should be
stopped.
