Students take to the streets
Just under a year on from the first major student demonstration against edu-
cation cuts, Wednesday 9 November saw students from across the country
arrive in central London to continue the protest against higher tuition fees.
Departing from Malet Street, the protesters marched on a route that led
through Trafalgar Square on their way to the City of London. Approximately
4000 officers were on duty, with the march being largely controlled. Though
approximately 20 people were arrested, the protest was a largely peaceful
event, in contrast with the events of November 10 2011, which saw protes-
tors occupy Millbank Tower. Photography by Tommy Allieri

protest? Felix would
