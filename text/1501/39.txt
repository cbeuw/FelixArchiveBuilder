Sport Editor
After the mad rush that was Issue
1500, the Club Captains are back for a
third interview! This week we feature
the Captain of the Imperial College
Rugby Union Football Club (to give
him his full title), Charlie Esberger.
We manage to meet up briefly on
Wednesday, just before the 1sts match
against St Bart’s and the Royal Lon-
don Hospitals 1st. At the time of the
interview, ICRUFC were sitting mid-
table in the South Eastern 1A division,
while St Bart’s were first.
His thoughts on the afternoon’s
match? “It’s going to be a close one,
the last time we played them we domi-
nated but threw away some points to-
wards the end and lost it.” Definitely
up for a spot of revenge then. (In the
event, the match is an emphatic win as
IC run away with it, 59-10 – Ed.)
I ask him how the start of the sea-
son has gone for the first XV. “We’ve
played four matches so far, and won
three of those. We were disappointed
to lose a tight match to St Bart’s (as
mentioned above – Ed.) but followed
that up with a great win against St
Mary’s. We all hate St Mary’s, none
more so than our coach Birkett.”
Any particular reason for the animos-
ity? “They’re just really gobby – they
think they’re the dog’s bollocks. Also,
we’ve had some good, physical games
against them in the past.” Ah, nothing
like a good rivalry to spice things up
a bit (although Charlie tells me Ports-
mouth aren’t very high up his list of
friends either).
While the firsts are evidently doing
well, having now won four out of five,
I ask about the fortunes of the other IC
Rugby teams.
“The 2nd XV have had a decent start,
and sit second in their league (South
Eastern 3B – Ed.). They’re pushing to
go back up after relegation last season.
The 3rd XV have started slowly, but
will push on from here.”
As he mentioned that the 2nd team
are aiming for re-promotion, I ask
what the team’s objectives are for this
season. They have finished second in
their division for the past two years,
and Charlie seems determined to get
it this year: “Obviously this season
we want to go up. We’re trying to
make every session count by making
sure everyone is there and organising
things to target specific areas of our
gameplay.”
“We train Monday and Friday eve-
nings, while the 1st XV forwards also
drill the lineout on Tuesday morn-
ings. We have 4 coaches: Rich Birkett
– current Wasps 2nd row (Heineken
Cup & Premiership winner); Brimah
Kebbie, who is a club legend and has
been around longer than anyone can
remember, an ex-rugby league pro-
fessional; Ed Burt, who specialises
in video analysis and is employed by
Wasps; finally Joe Brown who gradu-
ated from here in 2010 and now plays
for Esher in the championship.” I can’t
help but be impressed at the depth of
the coaching staff. Surely the 1sts will
get promotion this year.
Having said that, a team is only as
good as its players. Has anyone distin-
guished themselves so far this season?
“Sean Baker is a complete animal
on the pitch and has been excellent.
Probably player of the season so far,
played across the back row and even
filled in at loosehead. Billy & Hugh G
have also been omnipresent and made
a massive difference on and off the
pitch.” Evidently the captain thinks
highly of his men.
As far as the off-pitch aspect is con-
cerned, we all know the rugby lads
know how to make themselves heard
at ACC nights. I ask Charlie how the
new bar night policy affects the club
and what he thinks about it. “I don’t
know the ins and outs of the situation,”
he says, “but it strikes me as a shame.
Maybe changes were necessary, but
the vast majority of people think it has
gone too far. The most the most frus-
trating thing is when the policy makers
repeatedly try and fob us off – people
aren’t stupid.”
Turning back to the lighter side of
things, I get the captain to tell a bit
more about himself. A fourth-year
physicist, he started playing rugby at
school, at Trent College. Has it always
been this serious?
“Everybody took it seriously there,
so I guess I always have and just con-
tinued on with that at Imperial.”
Finally, being French, and with the
World Cup just over, I can’t resist
picking his brains on England’s per-

Dislikes: Backs dropping the ball, St Mary’s,
Portsmouth, coming 2nd
formance. Does he think Martin John-
son is doing a decent job, despite what
could be called an ‘early’ exit? “Well,
over the course of Johnson’s reign
we’ve definitely improved. I guess his
challenge is to motivate the players he
has, and find the new ones to keep on
improving ahead of the Six Nations
and ultimately the next World Cup. I
think some of his selections surprised
some people, squad and teams as well
as substitutions.” Not condemnation,
but not entirely approval, either.
Good luck to ICRUFC for the season
ahead, and here’s to promotion!
