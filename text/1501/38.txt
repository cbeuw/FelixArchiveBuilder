‘Spanking’ brings Reading to tears
On October 22 the ICU Women’s cricket team
participated in the BUCS Women’s Indoor
Cricket Championships held at Fleming Park
Leisure Centre in Southampton. After a two
hour drive we looked forward to a day of ac-
tion packed cricket!
In this regional tournament we were one
of four teams alongside UCL, Southampton
University and Bournemouth University. Our
squad consisted of seasoned players Priya
Patel (captain), Priya Shah, Celeste van den
Bosch and Mithila Patkunan (wicketkeeper);
and new comers Natalie Jones, Mitali Mishra
and Taniya Parikh. Special thanks go to Sid-
dharth Kohli who acted as our coach and scor-
er. The full worth of his pre-match training ses-
sion and tips was revealed when Priya S took a
brilliant catch off the wall!
ICU Women’s Cricket team beat Bour-
nemouth University (twice) to progress
through to the finals at Lord’s.
We played two matches, of 12 overs each,
both against Bournemouth. We won by 33 runs
in the first match and a resounding 97 in the
second. Celeste shone in the first match scor-
ing 22 runs and picking up 4 wickets. In the
second match a fantastic bowling attack led by
Priya S caused the opposition to be dismissed
for a mere 24 runs in 4 overs.
The women’s team is now preparing for the
finals which will take place on January 25th
at Lord’s! Even though they’ll be up against
some tough competition from Exeter, Bristol,
Southampton, Birmingham and Loughbor-
ough who have also reached the final, the chal-
lenge is eagerly awaited. We will be practising
hard in nets until then. If you’re interested in
joining us, we’d love to hear from you so drop
us a line.

be updated every week.

After coming down from the league above Read-
ing were confident of a win. With our full squad
of 12 players and our coach Oli on the sideline we
were ready to cause an upset.
We had a relatively even first half with neither
side converting their chances leaving the half-time
scoreline at 0-0 thanks mostly to Goalie Jess. Fol-
lowing some great advice and encouragement
from Oli we went on to score our first goal two
minutes later – a slick pass from Teddy on the
backline for Shanika to finish from the p-spot, just
as Oli told us to.
Our second goal followed shortly after, Shanika
held the ball in the D for Harriet to run on to and
first time drag through the keeper’s open legs.
Reading tried to up the pressure but never looked
dangerous in our circle.
Meanwhile our defence continued to neatly
switch the ball around the back with Aash mak-
ing some spectacular tackles. Fifteen minutes in
Teddy dribbled into the D and smashed the ball at
the keeper, which she unfortunately saved, thank-
fullyNorawastheretosendtheballbacktoTeddy,
at the coveted p-spot, where she finally flicked it
into the net.
Our defence held their composure with Celia
making some key distributions straight up the
pitch. Kirstin was on the receiving end of one of
these and scored an impressive goal from an un-
likely angle! By now Reading’s heads were down
and IC continued to push forward. We had a num-
ber of shortcorners disallowed but Gigi finally
secured our 5-0 victory with a great push from a
rebounded shortcorner, leaving Reading crying on
the sideline...literally!
