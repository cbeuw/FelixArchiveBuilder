On Saturday 5th November, the Impe-
rial 2nd team continued their unbeaten
start to the ULU season with an out-
standing performance against the medic
2nd team. The traditional rivalry within
this fixture always adds a bit of excite-
ment to the pre-match preparation, and
it was evident in the warm-up that the
squad was very much focused on the
task at hand.
The foundations for the result were
laid early on in the match, as Imperial
came flying out of the blocks to score
an early goal. Beasley played March
through down the right flank, and
March’s looping shot slipped through
the keeper’s grasp to give Imperial the
lead. The second goal followed swiftly
as a corner was headed on by Beasley
and finished by Wright at the far post.
Imperial were able to maintain the
upper-hand in both the possession and
territory stakes, and a third goal arrived
when Joffre collected the ball on the
edge of the area and rifled a shot into
the right hand corner of the net.
With the score at 3-0 the medics put
together some nice attacking moves
which resulted in some chances, and
this served as a reminder to Imperial
that the job was not over yet. Before
half-time, Caron met Joffre’s corner
with a powerful header at the far post
to send Imperial 4-0 up at the interval.
The second half began competitively,
until Imperial were able to extend their
advantage when Joffre burst through on
goal and slid his shot low into the corner
of the net. It was another fine goal from
Joffre who would go on to earn man of
the match. Shortly after, Joffre played a
pass through to March who curled the
ball beautifully into the top right corner
to make it 6-0.
Having made both of their available
substitutions, Imperial suffered a couple
of injuries in quick succession. With the
team down to 10 and even 9 men for
a short time, the emphasis was largely
on keeping possession and maintain-
ing a shape as players filled into unfa-
miliar positions. Although this blunted
some of the attacking threat, the qual-
ity of football was still high. This was
rewarded by a further two goals for
March, both assisted by some sublime
skill from Baptista.
The result was one which will live
long in the memory of every Imperial
player, and it was rewarding to see ele-
ments worked on in training and previ-
ous matches come together in a superb
performance. The victory preserves
Imperial’s unbeaten start to the ULU
season and sends them one point off of
top of the table. After a break this week-
end, the team will look to continue their
strong start against LSE 2s before a cru-
cial derby match against Imperial 3s!

IC trounce Medics
thanks to strong play by the Surrey de-
fense, but the Immortals Defense kept
Surrey out of the game. The stingers
almost earned themselves some points
when a running back was free to make
40 yards; but an incredible show of
pace and tackling skill by Dexter Va-
lencia stopped the run. Meaning, at the
end of the half the score was a punish-
ing 19-0.
The second half started well; the Im-
mortals Kick-off team having a spec-
tacular game managed to consistently
make big hits and meant that Surrey
were always starting with poor field
position. Combined with a defense
which was making mincemeat of the
Surrey offense, Imperial soon had the
ball back in their possession.
With the lead established it was up to
the Rookie players to show what they
could do; and they proved themselves
true Immortals. Fantastic first game
performances in offense by Lawrence
Wild, superb tackling by Matt Connell
and a fantastic 10 yards diving catch
by Wide Receiver Max all lead to the
first rookie touchdown of the season
with a weaving run by Deebo Ogun-
banjo.
The defense showed some power-
ful players throughout; Temi Ladega
and Maciej Kurek showing speed
and power to sack the Surrey Quar-
terback multiple times, while great
coverage of both run and pass plays
by the Linebackers meant the Surrey
offense struggled to make first down.
Third down finished with 20 points
having been scored; special mentions
to QB Rob who showed some excel-
lent pace and strength to run the ball
repeatedly for first downs. Unfortu-
nately despite having an impressive
running and passing game until then,
Immortals
beat Surrey
Veteran QB Rob Wolstenhome threw
an ill-conceived pass in the 4th Quar-
ter which was fantastically intercepted
by a Surrey player and returned for a
touchdown. After conversion, the Of-
fense took the field and had the final
word; with Tino Millar running a 60
yard touchdown on the first play to fin-
ish the game with a devastating 46-7
win to the Imperial Immortals.
