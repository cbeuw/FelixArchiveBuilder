T
here isn’t a whole lot of
space in my flat. Its close
proximity to college is a
massive plus, but one of the
trade-offs is having to share
rooms. This isn’t all bad by any means,
but at times it can grow a bit trying.
When we moved in, we realised that
– thanks to the wisdom of some enlight-
ened architect – we were endowed with
two storage rooms. Having managed to
pile all the suitcases and broken book-
shelves into one, the question arose as to
what to do with the other.
The idea soon formed of having some
sort of designated place of quiet. Some
of us already had experience in the prac-
tice of meditation. After all, as millions
all over the world can attest, you don’t
need to be a devout Buddhist monk to
meditate. Anyone can do it, and should:
if you’ve never tried, I really can’t rec-
ommend it strongly enough. Even when
practiced for just a few minutes each day,
the mental and physical benefits of medi-
tation are well documented.
You might well object at this point:
“If you want to meditate, why not just
go ahead and do it? Surely, tranquillity
is something of the mind. Is such a lav-
ishly decorated room really necessary?”
You’re right, of course. But somehow,
having a specifically designated room is
a great way to motivate you to actually
use it.
Have I done enough to sell it to you?
Good, then let’s begin. First off, you’re
going to need to find all the stuff. We took
a trip to Camden; there’re a few shops
around the Stables Market that stock ev-
erything you might need.
Exactly what you end up getting de-
pends on your personal preference, as
well as the dimensions of the room. We
opted for a subdued red colour scheme to
fill room, which measure about a metre
by a metre and a half (small enough to fit
a person in but not much else).
We selected four large throws (£7 each)
to cover the walls and ceiling. Using
drawing pins, we affixed three of them to
the walls and hung one across the ceil-
ing – just below the ceiling lamp, thereby
softening the light coming into the room.
We then covered the floor with a thin
carpet (£6), and placed a simply pat-
terned cushion (£4) in the centre of the
room.
A table for incense burning is an op-
tional extra. We made ours by covering a
cardboard box with a couple of patterned
pashminas (£1 each). On top of this we
put a small box to hold the incense and a
fancy dragon-shaped incense burner we
picked up in the market.
In its completed form, the room’s a joy
to use. At the end of a stressful day, noth-
ing beats a quarter of an hour in silent re-
pose, as the pungent aroma of the incense
washes over you.

Wahey, we made it
to a second week!
Sorry for the lack
of toilet jokes this
time: we were flushed
for ideas. BOOM!
Groaning already?
