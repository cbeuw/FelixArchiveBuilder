Ay-caramba! Medics win Tries aplenty for seconds
ICSM Football Rugby
St .Bart's 1 1
ICSM 1 10
The ICSM team lived up to its
billing as one of the favourites to
win UL Division One with an
emphatic 1 0-1 away win in the first
game of the season against SBLH
1 sts. The loss of several key players
left a somewhat depleted team with
a tricky away tie at Chislehurst
against notoriously determined
opposition. Once the game start-
ed, however, there was little debate
as to which was the stronger side
and ICSM dominated. The amount
of possession was not reflected in
the scoreline at halftime with ICSM
only winning 2 — 0.
This was rectified in the second
half as the Medics put 8 goals past
the helpless SBLH keeper. Adam
Humphries made a notable 1st
team debut on the left wing and
John Williams made many pene-
trating runs from midfield. He was
eventually fouled on one of these
runs resulting in a penalty that the
captain Ned Carabine put away
with aplomb. SBLH never posed
any danger up front and any
attacks were nullified by the ICSM
defence and the impressive
Eamonn Rabie. The SBLH goal
came at the death as a header was
deflected past the keeper. This,
however, could not be much of a
consolation to them as the Medics
scored goal after goal and hit the
woodwork twice.

After a poor start to the season last
week with a narrow win against
Brunei (I), the seconds soon hit top
form. As the harsh winds of Har-
lington blew across the pitch and
kick off drew near, the tension and
anticipation soon rose. With the
advantage of the wind the medics
went into an early lead as the new
2nds tried to gain some kind of
shape in the forwards. Then as the
backs and forwards started to dom-
inate all over the pitch, the score
started to mount as the 2nds moved
up a couple of gears, the first try
coming as Tim "the Gay icon"
Denyer burst through their defence
to score. Soon followed more tries
from Flo and Rich Seppings but a
lack of tackling ability let the medics
score with ease, leaving the score at
half-time to be 31 -8 in our favour.
As the second half started, so the
2nds started playing exhibition
rugby with the backs playing golden
rugby, more tries followed as the
forwards secured good ball to allow
the backs to score almost every time
they gained possession. As the
score rose so did the 2nds aggres-
sion, managing to reduce their
team to 1 3. After repeated pleas for
mercy, the ref gave in and called
time with 20 minutes still on the
clock. In the end, "the gay icon" led
with five tries and Flo was just
behind with four.

The only phrase to describe this
performance would be aerial dom-
inance with 3 of the 4 IC goals
coming form our boy's bonces.
A new system was needed fol-
lowing the absence of Nak and
Steve, and it took us a little time to
adapt allowing GKT to score a
sloppy first goal. However, this did
not knock us off track, as we start-
ed to pass the ball around well in
the midfield. The first goal came
from a nice move involving Juan
and Dave and Alex nodded the ball
over the stranded keeper.
After this it was all IC and we
took the lead before the break
thanks to a storming header form
Tony. The ball was whipped over by
Warren and Tony managed to head
the ball and take two defenders
and put them all in the back of the
net.
In the second half the differ-
ence in class was obscene, Dan
extending the lead, with another
header from Jamie's cross.
Whining Warren scored the
fourth after a move that involved
most of the team. By the time they
scored their second, the game was
won.
UCL 1 2
IC 1 1
Gutted! Absolutely gutted. IC
played like champs for most of the
game and took the lead after a
UCL defender steered in Warren's
header. We created a few other
half-chances, but failed to find the
target.
With 15 mins to go we were
still in control when a forward was
allowed to stroll through the mid-
field/defence and hit a lame shot
that squirmed through the bewil-
dered keeper.
Things went from bad to worse
when another defensive mix up
allowed them to get the winner with
about 7 mins left.

What can I say, another Wednes-
day, another BUSA fixture, another
crushing victory.
It seems the Disco Lads barely
missed their gallant heroic (and
really rather attractive) leader
Fabio, in what was a most decisive
result. Tong the keeper was kept
busy by the subs whilst the remain-
ing 10 men spent the entire game
hacking the opposition to death in
their D.
The disco short corner routine
is coming on well this season and
of the 750 short corners so far,
Mammers finally converted one to
open his account. The first half
was comfortable but highlighted
by one simple moment of utter
glory.
In the midst of a goal-line
scrabble the ball came loose to
Prelapsed Bowel (lain Pyle) at the
top of the D. He entered the
channel of Love. With palm sweat-
ing and his shaft throbbing he
swung and shot his load into the
goal. The back-board exploded
in a thriiling climax to the half and
as he milked the last drops of joy
it was clear we were on to a win-
ner.
At the half we were up 5 to nil,
the tally, 2 to Mammers, 2 to Jesus
and 1 to the man of the match,
Prelapse. The second half was
typical Disco. Not elegant but
brutally (yes, you Mammers) effi-
cient.
Four more beauties flowed
from the stick of the sundance kid,
none from a yard but who cares, it
was another moment of Disco
glory so come on then, who's
next.
