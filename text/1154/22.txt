A n y o n e w h o c a n r e m e m b e r
the c h a s e scenes f r o m the
film The Blues Brothers will
formulate a pretty g o o d i d e a
as t o w h a t D r i v e r is a l l
about. T h e fantastic music
that a c c o m p a n i e s D r i v e r
may b e s o m e w h a t funkier
than that in the film, but the
i m a g e of a line of police
cars o n y o u r tail b e a r s
i n c r e d i b l e r e s e m b l a n c e t o
the film.
W o r k i n g o n both sides of the
law, t h e p l a y e r will b e
i m m e r s e d in t h e faithfully
r e p r o d u c e d streets of several
A m e r i c a n cities. W h e t h e r
you a r e running f r o m t h e
police o r w o r k i n g f o r t h e m
you'll n e e d to thrash your c a r
a r o u n d in aggressive style
but without r u n n i n g it into
the g r o u n d . H a n d b r a k e
turns, high speeds a n d skid
marks e m b r a c e the g a m e -
play in large quantities, but
to fulfil the tasks set before
you, y o u will n e e d to learn
how to h a n d l e these skills
with finesse a n d fine j u d g -
ment. It is these qualities
that e n s u r e this is o n e
r e m a r k a b l e g a m i n g experi-
ence.
S u b l i m e g r a p h i c s , immersive
s o u n d , realistic c a r h a n d l i n g
as well as originality a n d o n -
the-edge tension a l l m a k e
this g a m e shine. Brilliant.

I really love flying. In my time in the RAF cadets, I took to the a i r in
everything f r o m single prop C h i p m u n k s to four e n g i n e d Hercules trans-
ports a n d I loved every minute o f it. B e c a u s e of this, I a l s o love flight
sims - all the experience of flying without the expense a n d the smell o f
aviation fuel.
Fly! is a serious flight s i m , d e s i g n e d with real p r o p e l l e r h e a d s in m i n d .
S u p p l i e d o n three C D ' s , it is certainly d e t a i l e d . M a p s o f the entire
w o r l d a r e i n c l u d e d , a l t h o u g h only five m a j o r U S airports are m a p p e d
out in m u c h detail. With five planes t o c h o o s e f r o m , o n the surface
this looks like a g o o d g a m e .
However, Fly! doesn't have m u c h else g o i n g f o r it. T h e p r o b l e m with
releasing a serious flight s i m like this is that there already is o n e -
/Microsoft Flight Sim - that's b e e n a r o u n d for ever, d o e s everything y o u
c o u l d w a n t it t o a n d has great graphics. In o r d e r for there t o b e a n y
point at all releasing your s i m o n the market, y o u have to offer either
a better product, o r o n e that d o e s s o m e t h i n g entirely n e w a n d differ-
ent. O t h e r w i s e y o u might a s well not bother.
The most o b v i o u s p r o b l e m is the g r a p h i c s . C o m p a r e d to other g a m e s
s u c h a s Falcon 4.0 o r Flight Simulator, the scenery is sparsely d e t a i l e d ,
the textures are blurry a n d the c l o u d s are just plain bizarre. It's a bit like
flying a plane with a thin layer o f m a r g a r i n e s m e a r e d o n the cockpit
window. T h e w h o l e point o f a flight sim is t o m a k e the player feel like
they a r e actually flying a real plane. If the graphics a r e s o b a d that
y o u s o m e t i m e s can't even tell whether the plane is m o v i n g o r not, it's
not really simulating m u c h at a l l .
The g a m e also has m o r e than its fair share of bugs a n d glitches. After
installing the g a m e it t o o k m e a n h o u r t o get m y network c o n n e c t i o n
w o r k i n g properly a g a i n . B e c a u s e I'm using a V o o d o o - b a s e d g r a p h i c s
c a r d , I have to start flying, quit the mission a n d then restart in o r d e r to
m a k e it work. M i n o r things, m a y b e , but irritating all the s a m e .
I have t o a d m i t that, despite my c o m p l a i n t s , I d i d enjoy a f e w o f the
scenarios i n c l u d e d in the g a m e - trying t o land at S a n Francisco air-
port in a thunderstorm for e x a m p l e - but there are far better flight sims
o n the market.
Basically, don't buy this unless o n e of the game's d e v e l o p e r s forces y o u
to at g u n point. A n d even then, h a n g o n to the receipt.
Just like M i c h a e l J . Fox traded his skate-
b o a r d f o r a h o v e r b o a r d , y o u c a n chuck
your g a m e p a d a n d get yourself a n Air-
p a d .
W h a t is a n A i r p a d ? A revolutionary c o n -
troller that uses the natural m o v e m e n t of
the player's h a n d to direct the p a d a n d
g a m e in the direction y o u want to g o . A s
y o u m o v e , the tilt-sensitive p a d will
transfer your m o v e m e n t s into the g a m e
you're p l a y i n g . R e m e m b e r those rally
g a m e s w h e n y o u willed t h e c a r r o u n d
hairpin bends at incredible speeds by
aggressively flinging yourself t o o n e
side? Well n o w instead o f l o o k i n g like a
prat a n d c r a s h i n g , y o u c a n look like a
prat a n d actually m a k e the turn.
The A i r p a d h a s its o w n m i c r o p r o c e s s o r
a n d works with optical technology. This
lets it react i n s t a n t a n e o u s l y t o your
m o v e m e n t s . T h e A i r p a d will b e c o m p a t -
ible with a n y g a m e but will c o m e into its
o w n in driving, s i m u l a t i o n a n d action
g a m e s , a l t h o u g h it will b e just as effec-
tive with platform g a m e s . It a l s o supports
both a n a l o g u e a n d digital m o d e s , which
is g o o d to hear. A t the m o m e n t it will
only b e a v a i l a b l e f o r the playstation
w h e r e it will have the s t a n d a r d layout of
the playstation p a d . T h e technical c h a p s
at A i r p a d a r e w o r k i n g o n a P C a n d
D r e a m c a s t design for the future (no N 6 4
unfortunately). T h e a i r p a d will retail at
£ 1 9 . 9 9 . I r e c k o n it will b e worth it
b e c a u s e y o u will g e t s o m u c h m o r e
g a m e p l a y o u t of the g a m e s , especially
after forking o u t 4 0 o r s o precious
