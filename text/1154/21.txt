The writer of Shopping a n d
Fucking returns. M a r k Raven
Hill is a thoughtful writer;
intelligent but not heavy, c o n -
troversial but not contrived.
The core of the play rests o n
the balance between h a p p i -
ness a n d meaning. Let me
explain; o n o n e side we have
"Trash", all they d o is drink,
dance and...and not m u c h
else - hard core hedonists.
They c o n s c i o u s l y try to
remove all m e a n i n g from
their sexual a n d otherwise
relationships. O n the other
side we have the Socialist, he
has always believed in the
cause a n d never sold out o r
c o m p r o m i s e d in any way, he
is - therefore - a tramp. H e
takes everything seriously a n d
finds difficulty having shallow
friends a n d pastimes. Balanc-
ing out these extremes lies the
ex-socialist, w a n n a b e Labour
MR w h o has sold out in the
eyes of the Socialists. They
are all unhappy.
All sound a bit obvious? Yup.
But this play is fast, witty a n d
very funny, a n d most of all it
roots itself in a core philo-
sophical question; what is the
best balance between just liv-
ing for the m o m e n t o r living
for your beliefs? Something
we would all like to find.
Lucio Fontana w a s , without doubt, a h e a d of his time. Before the likes of
D a m i a n Hirst a n d Sarah Lucas were a sparkle in their father's eye,
Fontana w a s pushing the boundaries of what we consider art a n d lead-
ing the Italian avant-garde, whilst later inspiring the likes of Andy W a h o l
a n d Henry M o o r e . It is ironic that such a n influential sculptor is so n e g -
lected by the British public - something which this exhibition is trying to
address.
Born in 1 8 9 9 , Fontana is best known for "sla shing" his canvases. The
exhibition appears to anticipate the public's reluctance to accept this as
art a n d confronts these preconceptions by putting his earliest work - tra-
ditional sculpture - immediately as you enter. The exhibition then presents
a n u m b e r of more 'classical' sculptures, beautifully juxtaposed with par-
adoxical pieces influenced from his work in a commercial pottery factory.
This sense of parody is always evident, although I a m hesitant about s o m e
of the pieces which seem more inspired by the work of under achieving
four year olds rather than "Neolithic art", as I was assured!
However, the exhibition then moves upstairs a n d we are presented with the
"Spatial concepts" (or cut up bits of paper as us phiiistines would have it).
Since Fontana has already been proven to be an obviously skilled sculp-
tor it is hard to dismiss his work as mere pretentious shite. Even the most
h a r d e n e d cynic finds themselves searching for a n underlying philosophy,
so evident in the previously seen pieces.
This is the exhibition's strongest point; we are led gently into confronting
o u r preconceptions of art. W e are gradually introduced to his more c h a l -
lenging work, leading to a greater appreciation of the historical a n d philo-
sophical influences in art. It highlights Fontanas' redefinition of sculpture
in a n a g e of nuclear power, television a n d space travel a n d questions the
implications for m a n k i n d as well as the possibility for artistic development.
I a m still not 1 0 0 % convinced by the whole Stanley knife a n d canvas thing.
However, o n e thing is for certain; either Fontana is a genius artist - o n the
cutting e d g e of art - or he is a genius con-artist, baffling a lot of pseudo-
intellectual people into thinking that something which takes 2 minutes to
produce is worth £300, 0 0 0 . Either way, respect is d u e .
Those of you w h o appreciate a n d enjoy
early 1 7th century art, with all its stiff neck
collars a n d stern expressions, will love this
exhibition, as V a n Dyck is the unrivalled
king in this field.
O v e r 1 0 0 of V a n Dyck's portraits, religious
and mythological works are o n show, rang-
ing from small sketches to massive 3 metre
tall paintings. The clothing in the portraits
are what steal the show - the detail, texture,
folds a n d colours of the garments are f a n -
tastic. However, don't expect the exhibition
to cheer you up as black is the most fre-
quently used colour, a n d smiling was obvi-
ously deeply untrendy in V a n Dycks era. In
fact, a fellow visitor c o m m e n t e d , " H e (Van
Dyck) has a n incredible knack of making
everyone look constipated!"
Personally, I a m not a major fan of this type
of art a n d was inclined to write it off before
I saw it. However, if you take time to study
e a c h picture you may well find yourself
inspired by them - especially as many of the
pictures were drawn by V a n Dyck when he
was only nineteen.
I would r e c o m m e n d the exhibition to any of
you art fans out there, but for the rest of us
I would advise getting your cultural kicks at
the (free) Serpentine gallery a n d spending
the money you've saved o n a few drinks at
the U n i o n !
