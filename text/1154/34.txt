Ladies off to better start IC shoot to win
Fencing Basketball
After what c o u l d b e considered a
disappointing season last year, IC
Ladies Fencing t e a m g o t off t o a
g o o d start this s e a s o n , beating U C L
10-8. W e were prepared f o r strong
opposition, having r e m e m b e r e d fhe
team they h a d last year, but w e also
thought that w e c o u l d b e in with a
chance to take the match.
First w e fenced the foil, with
C a p t a i n Katherine winning all three
of her fights in excellent style.
Leucha w o n two of her fights, a n d
Annie put in a great performance,
considering she hasn't fenced for 1 8
months, but although there were a
couple of close fights, she didn't
m a n a g e to win a fight. That gave us
a 5-4 lead g o i n g into the e p e e ,
which meant that to avoid either los-
ing or drawing the match w e h a d to
win the e p e e t o o .
W e were hopeful g o i n g into the
e p e e , a n d C a p t a i n Katherine a n d
Leucha e a c h w o n their first fight, giv-
ing us a 2-0 start. O u r excellent
captain went o n to w i n both her
other fights, the last o n e securing
the match before w e ' d even fin-
ished. C l a r e fenced well, but h a d
rarely fenced epee before a n d didn't
m a n a g e to take a fight. Leucha w o n
o n e of her other t w o fights a n d IC
took the match 1 0-8.
Rumours a b o u n d that there are
a c o u p l e of g o o d fencers out there
w h o haven't turned u p yet, a n d also
that U C L w o u l d be o u r most difficult
m a t c h , s o with the possibility of a
stronger team later in the season,
we face o u r next match with o u r
confidence high.
King's 5 6
Imperial.... 6 2
Traditionally, the first match of the
season has never been very g o o d
for the mens firsts, a n d today w a s
no exception.. That wasn't b e c a u s e
Kings played well, despite their new
talent, but because w e were still
suffering from not e n o u g h practice
over the summer. W e m a n a g e d to
beat ourselves o n several o c c a -
sions, at o n e point being out-
j u m p e d by a 3-ft point-guard o n
the Kings t e a m .
The g a m e w a s pretty even
throughout, with Kings l e a d i n g f o r
most of the g a m e . This w a s d u e
mainly to o u r inability to r e b o u n d
the ball o r put shots i n , despite
having a n a v e r a g e height a b o u t
half a foot bigger than our oppo-
nents. A s t h e g a m e went on
though, certain players picked up
their game, and made key contri-
butions that kept us in contention
for victory.
Of particular note were Adam,
KK and Ellias from last year, as well
as James and Franck who have
joined us this year. They all played
exceptionally well, and helped us
to pull away in the final minutes as
Kings fell apart. O u r composure
towards the buzzer was certainly a
marked improvement on last year.
The team still has a lot of work
to do before we can consider the
dizzy heights of Oxford, but things
are certainly looking good for the
play-offs. With any luck, we should
have a very good season.
Trip to Coleraine IN BRIEF
Sailing-June 17-20 1999
A n intrepid collection of sailors a n d
non-sailors m a s s e d in Southside o n
the evening of the 1 7th of J u n e f o r
the a n n u a l trip t o the C o l e r a i n e 2 4
h o u r race in N o r t h e r n Ireland.
Imperial h a s b e e n entering t h e
event f o r 2 7 consecutive years a n d
our a t t e n d a n c e is highly v a l u e d .
The format of the race is that a
boat is kept sailing f o r 2 4 hours
from 2 p m Saturday to 2 p m S u n d a y
with pit stops f o r crew c h a n g e s etc.
as m a n y times as r e q u i r e d / w a n t e d
in that time.
It w a s d e c i d e d that w e w o u l d
enter o n e serious(ishl) t e a m a n d
o n e really not very serious at all
t e a m into the event this year.
Finally the sailing started. T h e
first t e a m h a d a g o o d start but then
lost a l o a d by putting u p their s p i n -
naker w h e n they'd forgotten h o w to
fly o n e . C a n ' t r e m e m b e r a b o u t the
s e c o n d t e a m . Right f r o m the start it
was clear that o u r m a i n rivals were
g o i n g to b e a t e a m of p e o p l e from
Strathclyde w h o t o o k it a l l f a r t o o
seriously. A rule w a s instigated
where f o r the evening the s e c o n d
t e a m h a d t o o take a four p a c k o u t
with t h e m , to b e c o n s u m e d whilst
sailing. T h e first t e a m were racing
round in o r near to first p l a c e ,
whilst the w i n d started to d r o p in
the evening. S o m e highly a m u s i n g
spectator sport w a s to b e h a d by
watching S a r a h trying to steer a
boat instead of a minibus, with B e n
a n d h e r regularly s w a p p i n g jobs
a n d even m o r e often to b e seen
s w i m m i n g round the t o p of the
m a s t , untying s o g g y w e t s p i n -
nakers
D u r i n g t h e night t h e w i n d
p i c k e d u p , S i m o n a n d Alex r e c o r d -
ed the fastest l a p of the race, O i l y
a n d various helpers sailed r o u n d in
lots o f c i r c l e s , with v a r i o u s
a p p e n d a g e s stuck to their heads,
without actually c o m p l e t i n g a l a p .
They must have then g o t b o r e d
b e c a u s e the s e c o n d t e a m boat w a s
seen to be pulled u p o n the b e a c h
for a n hour o r s o whilst s o m e other
p e o p l e were w o k e n u p a n d per-
s u a d e d t o sail.
In the e n d the first t e a m c a m e
s e c o n d o n h a n d i c a p , despite c o m -
pleting m o r e laps than ever c o m -
pleted before a n d being genuinely
brilliant. T h e s e c o n d t e a m didn't
really rate in sailing terms at all, but
they also s u c c e e d e d in terms of
b e i n g g o d s , just in a slightly differ-
ent, m o r e hazy way.

having played the first half t h r o u g h
the s m o k e a n d against a back d r o p
