"We are s o lucky, w e have three
superb m u s e u m s literally just
down the r o a d " I told my M u m
when I got here. Three years
down the line, I have m a n a g e d
the Science a n d Natural History
Museums once and the V & A not
at all. For the first time I p o p p e d
in, a n d inside I found the C a n o n
photo gallery currently showing
the Triple Exposure exhibition.
Triple Exposure showcases the
work of three photographers of
the 1 9 6 0 s - Michael C o o p e r ,
John C o w a n a n d Ronald Traeger.
All three enjoyed brief, intense
professional lives, untimely death
claiming them just as their
decade faded to a close. These
photographers between them
have worked with the Stones, the
Beetles, Kubrick, Twiggy a n d
Mary Q u a n t . In many ways they
redefined fashion photography
and yet there are also incredibly
thoughtful pieces here. C o o p e r
photographed the cover for the
Sergeant Pepper a l b u m but his
grainy shots of the Grovesnor
Square anti-Vietnam riots better
capture the period.
Look at the world through these
pictures a n d y o u look with the
eyes of someone w h o was there
and w h o was a part of the revo-
lution.

The n e w Stephen Poliakoff play at the N a t i o n a l Theatre
sees h i m reunited with director R o n D a n i e l s . T h e pair
w o r k e d together previously o n , a m o n g s t other things, the
award-winning ' B l i n d e d by the S u n ' , a n d Poliakoff himself
has w o n n u m e r o u s a c c o l a d e s f o r his plays a n d films.
D e a l i n g with issues similar to those in his superb trilogy of
films ' S h o o t i n g the Past', he tells the story o f failed entre-
preneur Rick (Stanley Townsend) w h o discovers that t h e
collection o f w e d d i n g videos m a d e during o n e of his
'enterprises' in the late 7 0 ' s a r e deteriorating into a series
of b l o t c h e d i m a g e s . H e finds, via t w o Swiss archivists, that
the events of recent history a r e also being erased f r o m
videos w o r l d w i d e . Realising the possible implications of
this discovery he sees his last c h a n c e t o m a k e his fortune.
But the resulting events a r e unpredictable a n d not every-
thing g o e s quite t o p l a n .
Despite i m p e c c a b l e staging a n d the very innovative use of
v i d e o a n d m u s i c , the play s o m e h o w just doesn't work a n d
leaves a strange feeling of listlessness. The characters a r e ,
in the most part, true t o life, almost t o the point o f being
m u n d a n e a n d it is their familiarity that exposes the i m p l a u -
sibility of the tale. The. story doesn't quite ring true, n o r
a r o u s e m u c h interest in spite of the actors often e x a g g e r -
ated attempts t o c o n v i n c e us otherwise. O u r e m o t i o n s a r e
not stirred by the i d e a of losing a few videos, a n d this is the
play's d o w n f a l l .
With a m a z e of storylines, a n d a n often jumpy format (the
characters alternately relive the events a n d present their
o w n retrospective m o n o l o g u e s ) , the m e s s a g e is unclear.
N o n e t h e l e s s , the play is at times very funny, with most of
the h u m o u r c o m i n g f r o m the two Swiss, w h o a r e m e r c i -
lessly p a r o d i e d , a n d a r e in fact the only characters with any
real p a n a c h e . A bit o f a let-down really, as it c o u l d have
w o r k e d very well - a m o r e gripping 'discovery' w o u l d have
m a d e all the difference.

Musicals: most people think of soaring, romantic
p o p tunes, stunning d a n c e routines a n d huge sets.
Indeed, o n e starts to think whether these shows
w o u l d still b e brilliant if the helicopters a n d barri-
cades that w e are all used t o were taken away. The
N a t i o n a l ' s latest musical offering f o r its current rep
season suggests that they most definitely w o u l d .
C a n d i d e is based o n the b o o k by Voltaire, a n d pro-
motes unfailing optimism n o matter h o w awful a sit-
uation a p p e a r s at the time, resulting in the notion
that "Everything is f o r the best in the best of all p o s -
sible worlds". John C a i r d ' s n e w version uses a basic
but ingenious set, d e s i g n e d by the master of musical
set design J o h n Napier, letting his cast give the tale
a p a c e a n d life that never waives, even throwing in
the o d d Python-esque m o m e n t a l o n g the way.
A l t h o u g h more f a m o u s f o r musicals such as West
Side Story a n d O n the Town, Bernstein's O p e r e t t a
C a n d i d e is probably the c o m p o s e r ' s most a c c o m -
plished theatrical score. H e chose Voltaire's b o o k as
it g a v e h i m the c h a n c e t o attack the optimism that
prevailed in 1 9 5 0 ' s A m e r i c a under Dwight D Eisen-
hower's presidency, a n d his c o l l a b o r a t i o n with a
n u m b e r of lyricists, including the legendary Stephen
S o n d h e i m , results in s o m e of the wittiest lyrics I have
ever heard o n the stage.
The real genius in C a n d i d e , however, is that it m a n -
ages to b e satirical a n d hilarious, but at the same
time asks those worldly questions that w e all w o u l d
like a n answer to. You will roll in the aisles, question
your o w n existence a n d feel the hairs rise o n your
neck. If you don't like " M u s i c a l s " , g o a n d see this, it
might just c h a n g e your mind. If y o u love musicals,
g o a n d see this, but for o n c e y o u won't have to look
through the set to see the real show.
