Tasting Notes
Week Four : Under the Grill
The Basic Skill
Grilling
In the last three weeks, we've cov-
ered boiling, frying a n d baking.
This week, we look at the last basic
skill, grilling. By the e n d of the term,
this c o l u m n will have c o v e r e d
everything you need to c o o k a full
Christmas dinner. There's still a
long way to g o !
W h e n f o o d is grilled, the liquid
within evaporates upwards. A t the
top it hits direct heat from the grill,
a n d when this liquid caramelises
the f o o d turns brown. Browned
f o o d looks a n d tastes great. The flip
side is that grilling dries f o o d out,
loosing flavour and roughening tex-
ture.
M a n y people c o o k f o o d t o o
close. A g o o d distance between the
heat source a n d the t o p of the f o o d
is 1 0 c m . Y o u m a y want to move a
little closer if the f o o d is very thin,
or further away if it is very thick. If
f o o d is t o o close, y o u c h o o s e
between burning the t o p , a n d not
cooking the middle. Too far away,
and the f o o d will not brown.
Food should c o o k with a steady
sizzle, a n d brown slowly. If the f o o d
is c o o k e d t o o slowly, it will just stew
in its o w n juices, a n d you might as
well have used a sauce p a n !
Meal Suggestion
Spicy Fish
I a m a huge s e a f o o d fan. S o far,
this c o l u m n has avoided fish, s o I
thought I'd m a k e up for lost time
now. Fish is expensive, but worth
every penny in my o p i n i o n . This is
really simple, a n d tastes great.
M a n y people dislike eating whole
fish, o r even fish with the skin o n .
You c a n m a k e this with almost any
type o r cut of fish. Best is a whole
white flat fish, such as skate. Thick-
er fish will work, but y o u should b e
careful to c o o k it well.
If you are using whole fish, start
by cutting several deep gashes in
e a c h side. M i x a t e a s p o o n o f
g a r a m masala powder with a c o u -
ple o f tablespoons of olive oil p e r
fish. Rub this mixture over the fish,
then place in a n oven proof dish, o r
o n a baking tray.
Grill for about 1 0 minutes. The
heat of the dish will c o o k the under-
side, so there's n o need to turn.
Advanced Tip
Spectacular cheese on toast
I don't expect y o u to believe this
recipe will work. W h e n a friend
m a d e it, I w a s certain it w o u l d be a
disaster, s o I c l a i m absolutely n o
credit. It sounds strange, because it
involves grilling s a l a d , but works
really well. T h e e n d result is truly
spectacular; real posh f o o d o n a
budget.
M o s t people m a k e cheese o n
toast by slapping a b i g lump of
cheese o n b r e a d , a n d grilling hard
until it is melted. The secret here is
to use " a small a m o u n t of grated
cheese. The grill is used at a low
heat for a few minutes only, until the
cheese has mostly melted.
Start with centimetre thick slices
of g o o d b r e a d . G r i l l o n e side
briefly, until it goes hard, but barely
brown. Turn the b r e a d , a n d spread
thinly with butter. N o w , start t o
build. Your a i m is t o create s o m e -
thing which sticks u p a n inch a b o v e
the b r e a d . A r r a n g e a s o m e green
salad leaves o n each slice, just
e n o u g h to vaguely cover the whole
slice. I normally use something with
a bit of flavour. Rocket, o r water-
cress a r e i d e a l . W h a t e v e r y o u
c h o o s e , it has to look g o o d .
Place a couple of bits of sliced
tomato a n d maybe s o m e mush-
r o o m , o r red peppers over the
leaves o n each piece of b r e a d , then
a d d the cheese. You should either
grate, o r c h o p very finely. A b o u t
3 0 g p e r slice is n e e d e d , a n d it
could b e almost anything. C o m b i -
nations are great, so this is ideal for
using up whatever y o u have about.
W h e n your masterpiece is c o m -
plete, stick it under a really slow
grill. After a few minutes, the cheese
should have melted e n o u g h to lie is
strands over everything. In this brief
time, the salad leaves will wilt slight-
ly, but not e n o u g h to turn to mush.
Finish off by sprinkling herbs
over the top, together with a twist of
black pepper.
