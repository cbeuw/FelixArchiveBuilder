It's d e b a t a b l e whether N i n t e n d o c a n real-
ly call a g a m e 'budget' w h e n the r e d u c e d
retail price still weighs in at a hefty £30,
but at least N 6 4 owners c a n n o t g r u m b l e
a b o u t the quality of the titles available in
this range - they a r e a l l unquestionably
first-class, c r o w n e d by the classic Golden-
eye. The film was g o o d , introducing a
new B o n d , a new era. The g a m e , which
is only available for the N 6 4 (much to the
a n n o y a n c e of the P C a n d Playstation
faithful), is better. In fact it is quite superb.
U p o n its release G o l d e n e y e was hailed as
the pinnacle o f the first-person adventure
shooter g e n r e , if n o t t h e entire g a m e s
market, a n d to this d a y there have b e e n
few g a m e s to c h a l l e n g e for its title.
Taking up 0 0 7 ' s role f r o m the comfort of
a w a r m r o o m m a y s o u n d e n c o u r a g i n g ,
but sadly the perks of the job aren't includ-
ed - you're out to c o m p l e t e missions, not
earn bucketloads in casinos whilst sur-
r o u n d e d by beautiful w o m e n .
G e n e r a l l y s p e a k i n g , G o l d e n e y e bowls
you over not f r o m any single aspect of its
a m a z i n g game-play, but rather the p r o -
fessionalism a n d quality that endorses its
every detail. Each mission asks you t o
perform certain tasks that will n o t only
require the p u m m e l l i n g of e n e m y guards
but also the use oOf stealth a n d initiative.
The huge variety of w e a p o n s c o m e c o m -
plete with a n a i m i n g sight, often t e l e s c o p -
ic, a l l o w i n g y o u t o pick off targets f r o m a
distance with o n e shot to the h e a d .
Such is G o l d e n e y e ' s quality, it c o u l d well
m a k e you g o out a n d buy the c o n s o l e for
this g a m e a l o n e . After a l l , that's what I

Playing Traitors G a t e , you really have t o w o n d e r h o w the hell a g r o u p
of intelligent p e o p l e c o u l d spend two years of their lives writing a g a m e
that is quite s o boring.
The basic premise of the g a m e is that you have to sneak into the Tower
of L o n d o n a n d steal the C r o w n Jewels without being detected. T h e
g a m e p l a y style is similar to puzzle g a m e s such as Myst a n d M o n k e y
Island - the player walks a r o u n d a n essentially static l a n d s c a p e , solving
puzzles a n d collecting objects in o r d e r to achieve your g o a l .
The w h o l e g a m e is actually pre-recorded o n the four g a m e C D s - w h e n
you click s o m e w h e r e in o r d e r to move o r interact with your e n v i r o n -
ment, the g a m e finds the a p p r o p r i a t e movie file a n d plays it b a c k for
y o u . W h a t this m e a n s is that you spend all your time m o v i n g the m o u s e
cursor r o u n d the screen until you find s o m e t h i n g interactive like a n
o p e n d o o r o r a n object, a n d then clicking o n it to see w h a t h a p p e n s .
This is certainly not my i d e a of fun.
I have to a d m i t that I didn't actually play all that m u c h of Traitors G a t e
before writing this review. This was in part to d o with a bug in the g a m e
that m e a n t every s o often w h e n I saved a g a m e I wouldn't b e a b l e to
interact with anything a n d I'd have to g o b a c k to m y last saved g a m e
o r start a g a i n . But the m a i n reason I g a v e up so early o n was that Trai-
tors G a t e is boring. The g a m e pauses slightly in between e a c h l o c a t i o n ,
even if you disable the a n i m a t e d transitions, which is irritating to say the
least. S o m e different locations a r e actually identical t o e a c h other,
m a k i n g it very hard t o tell if y o u have actually m o v e d a n y w h e r e o r not.
A n o t h e r p r o b l e m is that despite the fact that all the locations are pre-
rendered a n d p r e - r e c o r d e d , the graphics still aren't very g o o d . It's kind
of like playing o n e of those early c o m p u t e r role playing g a m e s f r o m
a b o u t ten years a g o . The puzzles themselves aren't b a d a s c o m p u t e r
g a m e puzzles g o , but the e n f o r c e d linearity of the g a m e is extremely
restrictive.
The only possible reason I c a n think of for writing the g a m e in a pre-
r e c o r d e d v i d e o format is that it's m u c h easier to p r o g r a m . If it was writ-
ten using a decent 3 d graphics e n g i n e , with a n interactive e n v i r o n m e n t
a n d the ability to walk where you want, it might have been m u c h more
fun. O f c o u r s e , this w o u l d have taken m u c h more time a n d effort, but
then that is what it takes to write a g o o d c o m p u t e r g a m e these days. A s
it stands, the g a m e e n g i n e is far too a n n o y i n g to a l l o w the g a m e itself
to b e any fun whatsoever.
