RIGHT TO REPLY
D e a r D a v e
O k where d o I start this? I guess
the best place is with something I
learnt when I was very young - "with
every right c o m e s responsibility"; this
extends into everything w e d o . F o r
example with the right to vote c o m e s
the responsibility to use that vote, o r
equally the right to free speech
should require the speaker to be
responsible for what they say.
So far this term Felix has allowed
it's writers t o enter into a series o f
a n o n y m o u s p e r s o n a l vendettas
which seem t o simply a i m e d at stir-
ring up e m o t i o n within the IC student
population. Indeed the editor of this
newspaper openly admitted to m e
that he knew in advance of last
weeks edition g o i n g t o press that
" b r e a k point" contained intentional-
ly placed gross factual inaccuracies.
Whilst the author (who's identity I d o
know) should k n o w better, it is the
editor w h o is paid by you to keep you
informed about all matters related to
IC, a n d when that author allows arti-
cles to be p u b l i s h e d c o n t a i n i n g
incorrect information simply a i m e d
at stirring u p e m o t i o n , I (not as a
sabbatical officer - but instead, as a
student of this college) hold h i m to
account a n d ask him to explain his
actions t o you his readership.
Since starting this job back in
July I have worked hard a n d I a m still
trying hard to d o well in a job, which
by its very nature is extremely difficult,
a n d when the standard of my work
a n d my motives are called into ques-
tion by a n article filled with lies... I
find that personally offensive a n d
quite upsetting. Felix plays a n i m p o r -
tant part in the democratic system
here at IC, a n d part of that role
involves calling the sabbaticals to
check when they start to stray, how-
ever if Felix continues with this course
of allowing it's writers to c o n d e m n
the sabbaticals without any cause
then w h e n a sabbatical does actual-
ly require pulling back into line no-
one will be listening to y o u . T h e
phrase "cry wolf" springs to mind.
I'm sorry f o r those of y o u w h o

needed to d o it. W h e n s o m e o n e

very offended a n d upset... I a m here
to represent you a n d if I should ever
stop d o i n g that I a m only too happy
for Felix to call m e to account for m y

(the editor) to take seriously his role
as editor a n d r e m e m b e r the r e s p o n -
sibilities that c o m e with the right to
print a newspaper. I f o r o n e have
been deeply personally offended by
an article which he knew was factu-
ally incorrect a n d I a m disappointed
with him both as a n editor, a n d a s a
friend for allowing last weeks "break
point" article to g o to print unedited.

A N O P E N LETTER TO
THE RECTOR
D e a r Sir Ronald
W e are writing to you as a g r o u p
of 4th year medical students from the
School of M e d i c i n e . W e have recent-
ly c o m p l e t e d o u r Obstetrics a n d
G y n a e c o l o g y course at St M a r y ' s
a n d were shocked to read in IC
Reporter that you h a d given the n e w
videolink lecture system a n award for
excellence.
It is n o w a year since we were
expecting our first interactive lecture
over the new system. W e were p r o m -
ised that we w o u l d be able to view
lectures at the hospitals where w e
were b a s e d , but we could not. W e
were promised that these lectures
would be videoed for a sort of e d u -
cation by correspondence course,
but this did not h a p p e n for the whole
of o u r third year either. Time after
time w e have been let d o w n by false
promises of a start date for the c o m -
plete system. A small fortune w a s
spent in the last year by all-too-poor
medical students c o m m u t i n g to a
central location for e a c h lecture.
It has been o u r experience that
this system has repeatedly been a n
unmitigated disappointment a n d a n
abject failure. H o w it c a n w i n a n
award for excellence is beyond us.
in June, the Principle of the m e d -
ical s c h o o l , Prof Edwards, said that
the project was " s o m e t h i n g that no-
one is p r o u d o f " a n d that it's failure
h a d been recognised a n d that c o n -
tractors h a d been brought in to r e m -
edy the situation. A time scale f o r
these c h a n g e s w a s put in place a n d
widely publicised, but o n c e a g a i n
only failure has f o l l o w e d . Last week,
only days before o u r finals, o n e of
our lecturers h a d to travel all the way
to C h e l s e a a n d Westminster to give
a lecture t o 3 p e o p l e there a n d 2 6
people at St M a r y ' s , just because her
lecture c o u l d not be transmitted from
St M a r y ' s . There a r e m a n y m o r e sto-
ries of similar fiascoes - it is still not
unusual for a lecture to be transmit-
ted without sound or picture or both.
W e h o p e that you will not pro-
ceed with this a w a r d , a n d w e look
forward to reading your response.

dents from I C S M (names available

UNFAR ANONYMITY?
[What follows was not sent to me for
publication, but I would like your
feedback and have thus published it
anyway. Sorry for any annoyance
caused to the writer. ]
D e a r D a v e ,
I a m writing t o c o m p l a i n about
recent a n o n y m o u s columns printed
in Felix such as Breakpoint a n d Mish-
M a s h . I feel that the anonymity of the
writers allows t h e m to get away with
writing articles that c a n b e more ven-
dictive a n d untrue than those writers
w h o reveal their names. It allows
them to cause more upset to the sub-
jects of their articles without taking
any responsibility by revealing their
names.
I feel that if these writers are
given the opportunity to influence the
thinking o f m a n y students in the w a y
that felix allows, then they should be
forced to reveal their identity a n d
take responsibility f o r the columns
that they write. If they still wish f o r
their n a m e s not to b e published,
then it should be possible for people
