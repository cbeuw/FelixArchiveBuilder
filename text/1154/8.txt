always a plethora of interesting events g o i n g o n
in a n d a r o u n d IC. Yet even the most clued up
student c a n find it difficult t o find out what is o n

MILLENNIUM BITES
Improvements in the library a r e not just cosmetic
- behind the flat screens significant c h a n g e s a r e
taking place. T h e library c a t a l o g u e system is
being u p g r a d e d . T h e present telnet system is to
be replaced by a w e b based service. This means
the simple telnet terminals wiil have to b e
replaced with powerful P C s . Kevin w a s not sur-
prised to learn that the improvements a r e not
being m a d e just to improve the service provided
to students - Kevin has learnt that it is imperative
the library's n e w system is u p a n d running before
Christmas. T h e c o n s e q u e n c e s f o r missing this
deadline c o u l d be serious, as apparently the pres-
ent system has been bitten by the millennium b u g .
