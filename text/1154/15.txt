Jennifer Lopez
Waiting for tonight
(Columbia)
After the relative c r e d i -
bility of her h i p - h o p
f l e c k e d d e b u t "If Y o u
H a d M y Love" Puff
Daddy's favourite Puer-
to Rican actress returns
with a very different
track. C h e e s y d i s c o p o p
is very m u c h the o r d e r
of the day. M a y b e she is
trying t o a i m at the
lucrative pre-teen m a r -
ket, but this is just p a p
Day One
I'm Doin' Fine
(Melankolic)
Vocally similar to the A m e r i c a n nasal
sneer of The Eels, it would be fair to say
that the music is of their genre as well.
Lush strings a d d a dark atmosphere to
this tale of the dangers of increasing
access to information. This track would
be ideally suited to a n A m e r i c a n film
soundtrack, possibly played while the
serial killer drives h o m e as calm as
ever, even t h o u g h there's a half-
butchered girl trying to kick her way out
of the boot or the car. G e t the idea?
Honeyz
Never Let You Down
(Mercury)
O n e of them left to be with Matthew
Marsden a n d a clone was brought in,
but it doesn't matter 'cos it wasn't the o n e
who sings anyway. Their tightly pro-
duced sound of syrupy R'n'B p o p contin-
ues with this track. As ever, the chorus is
instantly infectious, the verses i m m e d i -
ately forgettable. M a y b e they should put
all their choruses together to m a k e o n e
great single. A n d then all leave to be a
with an ex-soap star p o p chancer.
Sound Buggy
Lovelord
(Double Nougat)
T h e s i n g e r of S o u n d
Buggy's high falsetto
makes Jimmy Somerville
s o u n d like Lurch's big
brother in comparison.
O n c e the s h o c k has
w o r n off, Lovelord
reveals itself to be a
happy, clappy little n u m -
ber with the infectious
b o u n c e of Air's Kelly
Watch The Stars. C o m e
the chorus, it's all change
as the gentle tones make
way for s o m e p o g o rock.
Witness
Hijacker
(Island)
Endless V e r v e - c o m p a r -
isons are hurled at this
lot, which aren't entirely
u n w a r r a n t e d . This is
softly-spoken, e m o t i o n -
d r e n c h e d , acoustic g u i -
tar-led m u s i c , with
insightful lyrics. T h e
tune h o w e v e r doesn't
s o u n d m a d e u p o n the
spot. This is like the
Verve. O n l y far, far bet-
ter.
Monk & Cantella
Enter the Monk EP
(Telstar)
If y o u c a n get past the n a m e , you'll
find that this d o e s bring the noise,
but not in a w a y you'd expect, o r
particularly w a n t either. Basically, it's
big beat with imaginative/silly s a m -
p l e s , guitars a n d s o m e w i d e b o y
h o o l i e shouting. This lot can't stay
still - " M y Style" starts as a s i n g a l o n g ,
bursts into Public Enemy-lite before
settling o n British 70's c o p - s h o w
t h e m e . R a n d o m .
Little Mothers
Yes!
(Island)
A n o t h e r entry into that worrying sub-
genre "Songs that s o u n d like 'Size of
a C o w ' by T h e W o n d e r Stuff" (which
you c a n file after that last Stereo-
phonics single). There are whispery
bits a n d subtler choruses but it's still
a n n o y i n g . T h e B-sides o n the other
h a n d s o u n d plain evil, in a n indie-
trip-hop collision k i n d a way, a n d are
consequently better. Jaunty.
You
P r o b a b l y o n e of the
m o r e disturbing c h o o n s
of recent times, with a
very bitter a n d ironic
A m e r i c a n c r o o n i n g
over the t o p of s o m e
highly p l e a s a n t p o p .
Extra points for getting
little kids to c h a n t
'We're so h a p p y y o u
f a i l e d ' . Subversive.
