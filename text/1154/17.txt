Warren G
I Want It All
(G-Funk/Restless)
The master of G-funk returns to the fray wax-
ing lyrical about the gangsta life. This eagerly
awaited a l b u m is the first cut from his new
label G-Funk. The West side influence has
given his laid back flow a rougher edge. N e w
label he might have but he's still d o w n with his
old crew, laying d o w n track after track with
Nate D o g g . T h e two were the perfect c o m -
plement back in the d a y giving us such H i p
H o p classics as Regulate, but time has seen
them evolve into different artists a n d now the
pairing c a n only p r o d u c e the industry stan-
dard collaboration where r a n d o m bodies
from the same label flip lyrics over the m i c .
Fortunately the single release off this a l b u m /
Want It All leaves us in n o doubt Warren G
can still operate in a hook-up, as he a n d
M a c k 1 0 flow through their takeover of the
material world. N o doubt with his new label
alongside his new status he'll soon be getting
"money, fast cars, g o l d chains a n d c h a m -
pagne, shit every d a m n thing".
Amongst others the G-master has s u m m o n e d
S n o o p , Kurupt a n d Slick Rick to the mic. The
So So Def connection is there in the form of
Jermaine Dupri w h o adds his clean cut lyrics
to Havin' Things. This tune shows off the G's
production skillz as he blends s o m e of the
Eastside's smoothest artists in a tune which
describes his down-low a p p r o a c h to the
music business. Just like the m a n says "ain't
nothin' changed", this a l b u m is m u c h like his
previous cuts. A c o u p l e of the tracks such as
the tribute to his mother show h o w he has
developed while we've all been waiting.
Rather than the re-birth G a n g s t a so badly
needs, Warren G has refused to leave the old
skool, rhyming about the dollars, the d o p e
and the dealers. That said, it's g o o d to hear
to from the m a n wh o funked u p hip h o p .

Tha Bomb - Phat Boy Thin Milen Is Back!
Tick, Tick, Tock B o o m ! What's U P ! T h a B o m b is back after a long
hard s u m m e r a n d we're g o n n a be bringing all of y'all back u p to date
with the g o i n g s o n a n d h a p p e n i n g s of the R&B w o r l d . Last year T h a
B o m b blew u p b i g a n d hopefully we c a n keep that g o i n g with m o r e
interviews a n d b a d ass reviews, but till we c a n sort that shit out y o u
g o n n a have to d o with the latest news.
First u p the M O B O s , the M u s i c O f Black O r i g i n A w a r d s were held just
r o u n d the corner f r o m us at the Royal Albert Hall d o w e get given
any tickets to g o there a n d check it o u t . . . . n o . But rather than rant a n d
rave o n their slackness o n tickets I'm g o n n a have a g o at the event. F o r
the s e c o n d year in a r o w M e l B o r G , y o u know Scan/, w a s hosting the
event, you'd think they w o u l d to learn from their mistakes n o . M e l
was her usually truly scary self a n d w a s literally jumping out of her dress,
yeah she d e c i d e d to follow Geri's advice a n d let it all h a n g out. Wyclef
l o o k e d like he w a s o n speed the entire time, but w a s at least funny a n d
w o u l d have d o n e better with a n y o n e else by his side. T h e worse person
o n the night was Patsy Palmer, you k n o w that annoying thing from East-
enders, she w a s s o fucking irritating I just wanted to slap her. O n c e
a g a i n the music saved the entire event with the c r e a m of British talent
d o i n g their t h a n g , Kele Le R o c rocked the place with the H o n e y z a n d
Beverly Knight stole the show. Those of you w h o where a r o u n d last year
might r e m e m b e r that yours truly was able to s c a m a n interview with Bev-
erly a n d told her back then that she h a d to win s o m e sort of a w a r d . A
year afterwards it happens....I'm just too g o o d at this!
The biggest news of the s u m m e r w a s the s u p p o s e d break-up of Black-
street. Since their third a l b u m d r o p p e d last year there have b e e n
rumours floating a b o u t because of the way it w a s received, the thing
sank like the Titanic. Teddy Riley w a s said to have been ready to jack it
all in after the label started getting o n their backs a b o u t it. Then news
broke that C h a u n c e y 'Black' H a n n i b a l w a s actualiy gay, more rumours
that Teddy h a d ask C h a u n c e y to leave the b a n d were d e n i e d by
C h a u n c e y but never by Teddy. Interscope e n d e d their relationship with
Teddy Riley's Lil M a n Records a n d Teddy has a n n o u n c e d he's giving
Blackstreet a break to work o n the G u y Reunion project. T h e situation is
all in the air, but it's obvious that something's not right. T h e n e w G u y
joint is d u e o u t in N o v e m b e r .
Q u i c k bit of news y o u all s h o u l d have heard of Rodney D a r k c h i l d
Jerkins, the b o y is probably the busiest, a n d definitely u p there with the
best, producers in the business. Everyone knows the D a r k c h i l d w o r k i n g
a w a y o n the n e w M i c h a e l J a c k s o n a l b u m , but it h a s c o m e to light that
he's also working with o u r very o w n Spice Girls o n their n e w joint. O h
d e a r ! This c o u l d be the worst decision of his life. Laterz.
