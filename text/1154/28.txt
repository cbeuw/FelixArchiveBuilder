"Are you mad? It'll be freezing."
"No it won't be. The water retains the heat from
the day, in fact the water's warmer that the air right
now. Look, it's even steaming slightly."
Sean had to concede that the evidence was in her
favour, and apart from that, he knew from previous
experience that she was perfectly right.
"Well, I'm going, even if you're not," she said and
started to undress. Sean watched in disbelief as she
unashamedly pulled her dress over her head and cast
off her underwear. He got up, slightly self-consciously.
They stared each other in the eyes, separated by
maybe two feet. Sean was making a heroic effort to
prevent his eyes from wondering below her chin to
where her bare skin gleamed in the fire-light. He
cleared his throat but for once he could not think of a
single appropriate word to say. Was it his imagination
or was she breathing slightly more heavily?
"I'll be waiting for you," she smiled and turned to
wade into the water. Sean was glued to the spot, still
speechless.
"There's no stones out here," she called over her
shoulder, "only sand." He watched as the waters grad-
ually inched up her legs, as her immaculate body rip-
pled with the rhythm of her strides.

H a d he h e a r d s o m e t h i n g ? A gull? A h o r n ? N o , of

thing he c o n t r i b u t e d to his fate. O n c e in the sea his
only mission b e c a m e trying to find the next breath of
o x y g e n in an o c e a n where the b o u n d a r y between air

O n c e only h a d he seen a n o t h e r s h i p m a t e , fleetingly at
the crest of a w a v e before they were torn apart a g a i n .
N e i t h e r of t h e m h a d c o m m u n i c a t e d a thing, they h a d
merely stared briefly into o n e a n o t h e r ' s ' terrorised
eyes a n d u n d e r s t o o d perfectly that h u m a n life was
totally without c o n s e q u e n c e in a situation like this.
N a t u r e d i d as nature p l e a s e d a n d m a n w o u l d watch
a n d live or watch a n d die, with no influence o n the
o u t c o m e whatsoever. S e a n was lucky. S o m e w h e r e in
the G r e a t Lottery of The Sky his n u m b e r s h a d c o m e up

But n o w he was d y i n g a g a i n , a n d this time he
t h o u g h t it was for certain. H e s u d d e n l y felt the n e e d to
urinate a n d was mildly surprised at h o w painful it was.
He realised that his b o d y h a d n o water left to flush his
m e t a b o l i c toxins into the w o r l d . Slowly he retreated
b a c k f r o m reality a g a i n a n d into his t h o u g h t s .
H e w a t c h e d Chris walking further and further into
the sea. The ground beneath her feet began to drop
away more steeply and the water rose quicker up her
body. Her long black hair touched the surface and
began to spread out like an oil slick. Suddenly Sean
sprung into life. "HANG ON!" he shouted hoarsely,
"I'm coming!" He began tearing off his clothes like a
man possessed and finally stumbled into the water.
Chris was treading water further out, watching him. He
ran into the deep water, eventually falling in with an
undignified flop. It was amazingly exhilarating and
Sean had to make an effort not to whoop like an
lunatic. Suddenly the alcoholic apathy was gone and
he began swimming after Chris who had turned and
was moving through the water with the elegance and
efficiency of a panther. She carried on swimming for a
whole ten minutes and Sean was painfully aware of
the gap that opened up between them. Yet his pride
prevented him from calling out and he struggled on
doggedly through the sea.
Eventually she stopped swimming and turned to
wait for him. He was panting when he reached her
and making a big effort not to think of fhe black abyss
that must have been yawning beneath them. Slowly
she swam to close the remaining gap between them.
"Stop swimming," she whispered, "I will hold
you." And so he did and those long sleek arms
enclosed him and he had never felt more peaceful or
secure b e f o r e in his life. The last thing she said was
the sea will keep its secrets."
S e a n never saw her a g a i n after that night. She
said that she w o u l d leave in the m o r n i n g a n d that he
c o u l d not k n o w why or w h e r e she was g o i n g , a n d that
is exactly w h a t h a p p e n e d .
S o m e w h e r e in the s p r a w l i n g Pacific S e a n knew
with a s u d d e n certainty that in the past five years he
h a d t h o u g h t a b o u t her every single day. H e h a d sin-
cerely t h o u g h t that he h a d gotten over her but only
n o w did he realise h o w utterly w r o n g he h a d b e e n
Several hours later the m o o n sank b e l o w the hori-
zon a n d a faint g l o w in the east was casting the stars
f r o m the sky. A n empty life jacket f l o a t e d o n the water,
trailing b e h i n d it a whistle that w a s b o u n d to it with a
nylon c o r d . The o c e a n was totally silent, undisturbed
by wind or creature. It carried o n in al! directions a n d
d i s a p p e a r e d at the u n b r o k e n h o r i z o n . It It w o u l d
always k e e p its secrets.
