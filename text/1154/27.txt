was quite simply the most beautiful w o m a n that he
h a d ever met.
Bizarrely, o n e of the first things that S e a n t h o u g h t
a b o u t d u r i n g their first e n c o u n t e r w a s w h a t she w o u l d
look like in forty years time. H e r features were so
strong that it s e e m e d that o l d a g e w o u l d only t o u c h
them superficially. N o t h i n g a b o u t her w o u l d ever s a g
or d r o o p o r melt o r d e g e n e r a t e . S e a n was totally cer-
tain that she w o u l d l o o k a b s o l u t e l y s t u n n i n g until the
day she d i e d .
Hers was not a c o n v e n t i o n a l beauty, it was a
beauty that resulted f r o m h u n d r e d s of small a n d c o m -
plex interactions. Like the fact that all of her teeth were
perfect except for that o n e incisor that w a s too s m a l l .
S e a n h a d tried o n m a n y o c c a s i o n s to quantify exactly
why he f o u n d her so attractive but he h a d never m a n -
a g e d to d o so satisfactorily. She was tall a n d athletic
yet the most striking t h i n g a b o u t her w a s her b r o a d
shoulders. They were not thick or brawny s h o u l d e r s ,
they were simply u n u s u a l l y wide for a w o m a n . H e r
a r m s , like her legs, were not m u s c u l a r either but
s e e m e d to disguise a s u p p l e strength a n d litheness. It
s e e m e d like there was no fat o n her b o d y at a l l . H e r
breasts were s m a l l but in S e a n ' s eyes perfectly f o r m e d ,
in all her w h o l e b o d y h a d a curious t o u c h of m a s -
culinity a b o u t it, yet in s o m e w a y this s e e m e d to m a k e
her m o r e f e m i n i n e H e r m o u t h was wide a n d her nose
was very l o n g a n d straight. H a d her n o s e b e e n o n any
other f a c e , S e a n i m a g i n e d it w o u l d h a v e b e e n t o o
long, yet o n hers it was perfect. H e r eyes were two
black wells in her d e e p l y t a n n e d f a c e , w h i c h s e e m e d
to s w a l l o w everything they l o o k e d at.
As a personality S e a n f o u n d her totally a b s o r b i n g
t o o . F r o m the first m o m e n t he first met her he felt that
they c o u l d h a v e d i s c u s s e d any t o p i c in the w o r l d with-
out inhibition She h a d that slightly cynical h u m o u r that
he l o v e d . She w a s p a s s i o n a t e a b o u t m u s i c w h i c h
S e a n f o u n d very r e a s s u r i n g : he h a d a f u n d a m e n t a l
distrust of p e o p l e w h o r e g a r d e d m u s i c with disinterest.
She c o u l d m a k e h i m g e n u i n e l y l a u g h , a n d he c o u l d
d o the s a m e for her. D u r i n g the short time that they
k n e w e a c h o t h e r there w a s never a n a w k w a r d

They walked down to the water's edge, but not the
sandy beach where Sean and the others usually
bathed. It was around the corner of the headland
where they would be totally alone. There was no sand
but only smooth pebbles, some the size of eggs, oth-
ers were rocks the size of wheelbarrows. Beyond the
beach young birches crowded to the water's edge.
For the whole day it had been stormy and raining
heavily but now the sky was almost clear. Only far
away to the north were there still dark stacks of cloud
and the occasional rumble of thunder. The air was
warm and but not humid and the wind had vanished
totally as if earth and sky were having a period of rest
and contemplation after the disturbances. Far away
across the water, towards the silhouettes of the hills on
the mainland, fog was forming and the air and s e a
appeared to be fusing into one.
Chris rummaged through the basket and pro-
duced a bunch of long candles which she lit and
attached to some of the larger rocks around them.
Sean busied himself with opening a bottle of wine;
thoughts of how on earth he would acquire another
one for his brother were strangely absent from his
mind.
Once everything was prepared they sat down side
by side and began to eat, whilst the distant fog began
to roll towards them, a few lights from the opposite
shore occasionally breaking through.
In his s e m i c o n s c i o u s state S e a n was a w a r e that
the straps that held him to the life-vest h a d b e e n c o m -
ing u n d o n e g r a d u a l l y over the past few hours. But
there was nothing he c o u l d d o ; he was too weak.
At ten o'clock they finished eating. They both left
the comfort of the dying candlelight and hunted for
firewood along the water. It was always bark/ess a n d
flat pieces of wood they found, bleached by the sun
and s m o o t h e d by the water and always bone dry.
Once the flames had taken hold they sat down again
- closer this time - and Sean opened the second bot-
tle of wine.
Earlier Chris had become strangely silent when
something came up in their conversation. Sean
explained that in two month's time he was going to
Madrid to see a friend, and he lightly suggested that
she might want to come along. His imagination was
becoming lubricated by the wine and already he could
not envisage the shadow of another parting between
them. But she did not answer, and when the silence
between them grew and grew he had to look across at
her. She stared into the distance and somehow it
seemed that her eyes were much larger and darker
than usual. Eventually she spoke.
"Please take each day that we share as it
c o m e s . . . " she whispered. Sean opened his mouth and
was about to retort but she pre-empted him. "Please,"
she repeated, even quieter this time. Sean agonised
for several minutes in silence and then decided to pur-
sue it no further. The moment passed and gradually
their quiet murmuring and occasional laughter by the
fire resumed.
The fog had long since disappeared and they
watched as the sun sank into the black hills across the
pale water. Above them a thin ribbon of cloud that
stretched from north to south was dyed blood red as
the day finally ended.
Half an hour later, the second bottle of wine was
also drained and suddenly Chris leapt to her feet.
"Do you know what we're going to do now?" She
said. Her eyes were bright with the alcohol.
"Urn...no, but I dare say you're going tell me."
"We're going to swim."
