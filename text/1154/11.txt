to get the names of the a n o n y m o u s
writers f r o m yourself o n request. I a m
not suggesting in any way that you
should reveal the names of the writ-
ers of a n o n y m o u s letters or your
sources of information, only the writ-
ers of regular columns or articles in
Felix. I d o believe in f r e e d o m of
speech, but I also believe in f r e e d o m
of information, especially in situa-
tions where a person's anonymity
would allow them great power over
others.
I feel strongly a b o u t this, a n d will
be refering the matter to I C U exec, if
you cannot remedy the situation
within the Felix team.
Kind regards

O U T OF BALANCE
D e a r Dave
I a m disappointed that you have
not printed our C h e s s C l u b diary
entry in the Diary of the current issue
of Felix (11 5 3 , dated 18 O c t o b e r ) . It
was submitted by email on Sunday
10th, which o u g h t to give y o u
e n o u g h time. Twice last year I sub-
mitted articles which didn't get into
Felix - o v e r l o o k e d , I suppose. If you
want clubs to write more for Felix,
please m a k e sure you print what they
send!
I a m not a great fan of Felix a n d
find little of interest in it these days.
Although it is "The Student N e w s p a -
per of Imperial C o l l e g e " I see it as
mostly a c o n d e n s e d version of "Time
O u t " . If I want to know what is h a p -
pening a r o u n d college I have to
consult "IC Reporter". W h e n e v e r
Felix comments o n C o l l e g e policy o r
decisions, it is often b a d l y
researched a n d one-sided - a n d fol-
lowed up next issue with an apology.
I would like to see Felix devoted
exclusively to Imperial C o l l e g e .
Don't duplicate what is already d o n e
elsewhere. If I want national/interna-
tional news I read a newspaper; if I
want to know what's on in L o n d o n or
on TV I look up "Time O u t " or " T V
Times". Let us know what is g o i n g o n
a r o u n d college - not only clubs/socs
events but also special guest lec-
tures, lunch time concerts (also
evening concerts in Royal School of
Music, which are also free), careers
talks, departmental o p e n days, etc.
G i v e us informed, b a l a n c e d , well-
researched c o m m e n t on C o i i e g e
issues - don't just jump on the b a n d -
w a g o n . G e t rid of the pages a n d
pages of reviews of music, games,
videos, nightclubs, etc. Focus on the
college a n d the students, make Felix
distinctive a n d worthwhile.

INTEGRATION:
THE QUEST CONTINUES
D e a r Sir,
Is it me or has everyone missed
the point of integration? It is not
a b o u t M e d i c s or non-Medics liking
or disliking e a c h other more o r less.
It is not a b o u t retaining or discarding
tradition. N o r is it it about s o m e evil
insurgent movement of medics into
I C U , or I C S M b e i n g s w a l l o w e d
whole by a load of apathetic IC stu-
dents. It is about economising.
W h y else w o u l d Sherfield
approve a n d a d o p t such a scheme?
ICU a n d I C S M should be more c o n -
cerned with improving the standard
of student life at Imperial a n d the
services provided. N o t blaming each
other for their lack of co-operation.
If they continue to fight amongst
themselves there will be nothing left
to call "Student Sen/ices", with no
social activities outside of your own
discipline, a n d I for one d o not relish
the idea of a 9 o'clock lecture being
the social event of the year!
Please, give up o n the petty
squabbles a n d m a k e college a place
people want to be.
Yours sincerely
A student
A N D FINALLY...
D e a r Sir,
If indeed the A & E G r o u p C h a i r
(how appropriate) runs for a sabbat-
ical position this year, we can expect
his tenure to be as g o o d as his trum-
pet playing; i.e. p o o r quality, with
splits all over the place.
With kind regards (and no, I'm
not Breakpoint)

THANKS FOR THE LETTERS.
All complaints should be addressed to the Editor. If no satisfactory

Firstly, sorry to Tim Traiior for
any offence c a u s e d - I certainly

sequently written a full e x p l a n a -
tion of the status q u o , w h i c h you'll

I'm sure the two aren't related...
Next, you'll see that the a b i l i -
ty of a n o n y m o u s writers to r e m a i n
a n o n y m o u s has b e e n c a l l e d into
question by o n e of the U n i o n
Officers (note lhat the letter print-
ed o n the o p p o s i t e p a g e was not
deliberately written for puD-lica-
tion). The simple a n s w e r to this
point is that there is no way that
p u b l i c a t i o n w o u l d d e l i b e r a t e l y
reveal the identity of a n a n o n y -
m o u s source. I k n o w for a fact
that it w o u l d irrevocably d a m a g e
the ability of the writers to collect
i n f o r m a t i o n if their identity was
k n o w n , a n d so it w o u l d s e e m
d e c i d e d l y u n f a i r (as well as
immoral) to reveal their identities.
O f c o u r s e , the issue of r e s p o n s i -
bility still r e m a i n s , but o n that
score the a n s w e r is simple - I take
full responsibility for every w o r d
printed in *his year's Felix. That,
