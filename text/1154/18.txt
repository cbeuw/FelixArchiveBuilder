London has been waiting for a
new club to compete with the
likes of C r e a m a n d G a t e -
crasher for ages, only for two
to arrive more o r less simulta-
neously. With Fabric's delayed
opening the main question
has been: c a n h o m e possibly
live u p to its m u c h hyped
billing as " T h e superclub for
the 2 1 s t C e n t u r y " ? T h e
answer, thankfully, is a
resounding yes.
Despite its C a n a r y Wharf like
a p p e a r a n c e a n d Leicester
Square location, h o m e w a s
not full of tourists mistaking it
for Equinox, thanks to a fairly
strict d o o r policy. Instead the
dance floors were r a m m e d
with incredibly u p f o r it club-
bers enjoying a great set o f
hard house from A m e r i c a n
special guest Danny Tenaglia,
before O a k e n f o l d took over
the decks at 1.30 (inducing
some serious hero worship
from most of the crowd). His
set was spot o n , with loads of
great tunes, ending with a bril-
liant version of his own Planet
Perfecto's 'Bullet In The G u n 1
.
I w o u l d highly r e c o m m e n d
h o m e - sure it's expensive, but
it's a unique venue with a
great line up. G e t there early,
as they're queuing round the
length of the Square, a n d
make sure y o u know a little
about dance music f o r the
d o o r m e n . I can safely say that
Fabric has a lot to live u p to.

Bedrock @ Heaven
A night to remember..
Thursday mid-October, it's mid afternoon a n d this lecturer is boring the
pants off me. No t only is his voice more boring than a n episode of O n e
M a n and His D o g , but for some reason he seems to b e walking u p a n d
d o w n in front of the board not unlike a pigeon nodding his head backwards
a n d forwards. O d d . However, because my mind is elsewhere, all this
doesn't bother me. M y foot is tapping, my knee is jumping a n d there's this
m a d banging tune going round a n d round my head. The reason for this
is obvious. Tonight at Heaven, one of London's best clubs, sees the Bedrock
first birthday party. Spinning the decks will be Bedrock supremo John D i g -
weed a n d pals Sasha and Danny Howells, a n d I know it's g o n n a be large...
Five hours later a n d I'm there, o r at least I'm in the right place - staring at a
queue stretching round three sides of block, a heaving queue of like mind-
ed clubbers ready for a massive Thursday. O f course I work for well
renowned music m a g Felix and security are expecting me. O n e lax secu-
rity check and I'm in. Despite the number of people outside it's already
packed and the dance floor is a sweaty mass of meat - it's heaven, it's gay
and I love it. After a quick pit stop at the bar (a bottle of Red - to taste it is
to love it), it's time to check out my Heaven. The chill-out coffee bar is d e a d
- n o need to revisit here then. Upstairs in two seweresque vaulted c h a m -
bers are two strikingly dissimilar atmospheres. O n e is lit by smoky red
lamps playing funky music to which boozed u p oldies (I'm only young me)
are going crazy. The other, a decidedly darker, grander r o o m , is packed
with punters going crazy in a n all together different kind of way.
But e n o u g h is enough. Downstairs o n the main dancefloor is where the
action will be for the rest of my night in Heaven. Digweed, Sasha and H o w -
ells o n the decks, one lady in a see-through dress and another going crazy
with some light sticks - it's a night to remember. Then, suddenly there's
Heaven Scent, next it's three o'clock and finally it's over. I could've stayed till
six, but I'll be back after a month of purgatory back in Heaven, back in
Bedrock. See you there?

Bedrock will be back at Heaven o n 1 1th November.
