Millenium turns students into staf:
RICHARD HOEY
C o n f u s i o n surrounds the College's
plans f o r housing students in halls
of residence over the M i l l e n n i u m
period. Apparently, n o decision will
be taken until D e c e m b e r , little time
to inform those affected. Unsurpris-
ingly, the University has f o u n d it dif-
ficult to find hall staff willing to work
over the M i l l e n n i u m . There are also
concerns a b o u t possible effects of
the M i l l e n n i u m B u g , with particular
worries expressed a b o u t the effect
of p o w e r cuts o n lifts a n d fire a l a r m
systems, especially given that street
parties m a y m a k e it difficult for the
e m e r g e n c y services to reach stu-
dents in trouble.
O v e r the Summer, it w a s pro-
p o s e d that a l l students wishing to
remain in University a c c o m m o d a -
tion over the N e w Year p e r i o d
should b e m o v e d into a single hall
of residence, in order to save o n
staffing a n d reduce the risk of p r o b -
lems associated with the M i l l e n n i u m
Bug. A c c o r d i n g to the Residences
M a n a g e r , S h a r i n e B r o w n , those
plans have n o w been s c r a p p e d .
She admitted it w o u l d have proved
"a nightmare" for students a n d par-
ents alike, a n d a g r e e d it w o u l d not
have been fair, since students have
paid for a c c o m m o d a t i o n over the
N e w Year period. But n o alternative
plan has been a g r e e d . M r s Brown
confessed "it will b e a m a m m o t h
task to sort something out". S h e
admitted the n u m b e r of W a r d e n
a n d security staff that w o u l d b e
available h a d not yet been estab-
lished, a n d did not rule out the p o s -
sibility of asking post-graduate stu-
dents to help out. N a t a s h a N e w -
ton, Imperial C o i i e g e U n i o n Presi-
dent, said the U n i o n h a d every
c o n f i d e n c e that the R e s i d e n c e s
office will b e able to sort this out".
But she expressed c o n c e r n that halls
might not b e sufficiently staffed with
W a r d e n s , a n d said she h o p e d that if
it c a m e to it, the W a r d e n s w o u l d
a g r e e to work over the N e w Year.
The Residences O f f i c e is n o w
under pressure to inform students of
their plans as quickly as possible.
The meeting of the Rector's c o m m i t -
tee o n student residences o n O c t o -
ber 1 3th w a s the last opportunity for
the University to liase directly with
Ihe I C U , but n o d e c i s i o n w a s
r e a c h e d , a n d the next meeting is
not until February. T h e College's
M i l l e n n i u m Issues g r o u p will b e
meeting in the next c o u p l e of weeks,
but a c c o r d i n g to Sharine Brown
they will b e u n a b l e to c o m e to a n y
decision until they k n o w h o w many
students a r e p l a n n i n g to stay for the
N e w Year. That will not b e c o m e
clear until the results of a student
questionnaire a r e k n o w n - a ques-
tionnaire that is not being issued
until the e n d of N o v e m b e r .
