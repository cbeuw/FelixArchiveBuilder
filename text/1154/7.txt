The State of the Union
By Natasha Newton, Imperial College Union President
Hello, how are w e all? This w e e k ' s
c o l u m n is brought to y o u by the let-
ters U, L a n d U a n d the n u m b e r 5 0 .
Here goes with the latest from o u r
University counterparts.
London Transport
I C U is n o w the only place in L o n d o n
where students c a n buy LT discount
cards over the counter. King's (who
were issuing them f r o m their registry
a n d not their Union) have n o w
stopped. O t h e r U L U colleges a r e
reporting a n absolute m i n i m u m wait
of 4 weeks for postal orders. S o a
big thank you goes out to the I C U
office staff w h o have w o r k e d flat out
to issue over 3 0 0 0 cards. T h e U n i o n
has 'lost' £ 5 0 0 in extra staffing a n d
more than £50 in postage, but then
you lot are saving tons.
Voting
Voter registration slips are available
f r o m m e o n e m a i l
(president@ic.ac.uk) a n d o n post-
cards from the office ( I C S M S U have
a bunch too). C o m i n g s o o n t o I C U
who's standing f o r what a n d t h e
promises they are m a k i n g . The elec-
Attack Alarms / Condoms
Aerosol attack alarms a r e available
free of charge (on production of a
valid I C U card) f r o m the U n i o n
Office Reception in South K e n s i n g -
ton. The other c a m p u s e s should b e
getting supplies soon. C o n d o m s are
available free of charge from IC
Health C e n t r e (Southside, S o u t h
Kensington). Dispensing machines
can be found in Halls, U n i o n toilets
or they c a n b e p u r c h a s e d f r o m
Southside S h o p o r I C U N e w s a g e n t
on the Walkway. There are plenty of
local chemists a r o u n d the main c a m -
pus sites. With a recent survey c l a i m -
ing 1 in 5 students are regularly hav-
ing unprotected sex, it is important
that you all stay safe. The U n i o n also
has a limited supply.
Accommodation
Term having started a n d routines set-
tled into, this is a b o u t the time that
the U n i o n notices that things a r e
going wrong with a c c o m m o d a t i o n
(either private sector or College). It is
important to know that things c a n b e
d o n e a n d that M a r t i n T h o m s o n
tions are next year. A lot of you will
a u t o m a t i c a l l y b e registered f o r
where you are living this year....BUT
N O T IN TIME F O R THESE E L E C -
T I O N S , b e c a u s e the local councils
are very slow with these things. If you
want to vote, fill in a c a r d .
London weighting
Loans, grants, whatever you get, are
higher for those studying in L o n d o n
than outside. B U T it's not e n o u g h .
£35 per w e e k w o u l d rent a large
house with living r o o m in N o t t i n g -
h a m , even more in the N o r t h . Lon-
d o n weighting does not allow Lon-
d o n students to afford equivalent
digs - we think we've d o n e O K if w e
only have 3 5 c o c k r o a c h e s for £ 8 0
per week! The Presidents of the U L U
colleges have b e e n ranting a b o u t
this for ages. The big c h a n g e is that
there is now a permanent m e m b e r
of staff f r o m U L U w h o c a n research
the exact stats o n how hard-up L o n -
d o n students are, which gets us a lot
further when we are lobbying people
etc. S o , in the interest of the c o m -
(Union Adviser), Kate G u m m o w (iCU
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Officer) a n d myself
can advise o n a whole range of
issues, including your rights as ten-
ants a n d help with any problems you
may b e having with your landlord.
C o m m o n problems could include
repairs not being d o n e when asked,
harassment by landlords, disputes
with co-tenants, problems with the
way rent is paid etc. These points
need t o b e stated now as problems
h a p p e n throughout the year. i C U
produces a detailed Housing Rights
G u i d e which is very helpful a n d can
be obtained from the U n i o n Recep-
tion in South Kensington. S o m e of
the serious problems often arise from
simple ones left t o fester. Advice is
just the other end of the line, s o call
a n d ask, however silly you may think
it sounds.
IC Health Centre Registration
If you have m o v e d recently (including
out o f Halls a n d into private sector
a c c o m m o d a t i o n ) you need to inform
m o n g o o d we will begin a structured
p r o g r a m m e o f k i d n a p p i n g a n d
assassination of all the rich kids s o
they don't skew the stats!!
IQ of 50
Has anyone, seen copies of L o n d o n
Student lying a r o u n d the p l a c e ?
They are s u p p o s e d to c o m e to Beit
but for two weeks they have not
a p p e a r e d yet! T h e o h s o bright
delivery m a n w o u l d a p p e a r to have
missed the Albert Hall landmark. In
the meantime m o p p i n g u p vomit
outside the main stairway loos will
have to b e d o n e with p a p e r towels.
(Sorry, M r C a m p b e l l , it's not that
b a d really!)
Clinic at Council
The U L U President Matt Butt will b e
at the next C o u n c i l o n N o v e m b e r
the 9th ( 6 . 3 0 p m U D H ) . H e will b e
answering questions of a l ! natures
relating to ICU in U L U , U L U a n d the
N U S , this years c a m p a i g n s a n d the
infamous U L U strategic plan (plus
anything else y o u want to know).
Imperial C o l l e g e Health Centre of
your change of address if you are
registered there. If you have m o v e d
out of the registration a r e a
( N l , 5 , 6 , 7 , N W 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , S W 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 ,
7,1 0 , W 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 1 0,1 1,1-4,W1 2
(College Hall O N L Y ) , W C 1 a n d
W C 2 ) then you need to register with
a doctor in your area. Correct regis-
tration covers your 2 4 hour care.
However any student c a n still use the
Health Centre during the day (as well
as students at the Royal C o l l e g e of
Music), whether registered at I C H C
or not.
Student Support Scheme
A g a i n I would like to remind first
years who have not contacted the
Student Loans C o m p a n y for whatev-
er reason that if they d o not apply for
a loan then they WILL N O T BE ELI-
GIBLE for any future help, should
they try a n d apply in their second o r
third year. The trick is to apply, fill out
all the forms a n d then request zero
pounds when the last form arrives.
C o u n c i l will, as always, be o p e n to
ail, so c o m e a l o n g a n d quiz!
