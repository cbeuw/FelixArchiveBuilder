a thin sickle that s h o n e with u n a c c u s t o m e d brightness,
its unlit portion b e i n g the only truly b l a c k piece of the
sky — a dark o v a l a m o n g s t the countless pinpoints

Barely n o t i c e a b l e a m o n g s t the emptiness of t h e

H e is alive a n d c o n s c i o u s but he is losing these
two qualities slowly a n d surely. His eyes are swollen
a l m o s t shut a n d the whites have a s s u m e d the c o l o u r
of d a r k b l o o d . His face is terribly burnt f r o m the t r o p -
ical sun a n d his lips are swollen a n d d i s c o l o u r e d , sur-
r o u n d e d by a h a l o of crystallised salt. His t o n g u e is so
thick that he c a n n o t breath t h r o u g h his m o u t h .
His n a m e is S e a n , a n d he was a research assistant
o n a vessel w h i c h sank in a t y p h o o n twenty miles t o
the east. H e is a l m o s t certain that h e is the only sur-
vivor. A r o u n d his inert f o r m is tied a frayed a n d f a d e d
life jacket, the bulk of it b e i n g a large polystyrene
b l o c k w h i c h is a t t a c h e d to his chest, a n d the rest of it

is tied with a thin nylon c o r d a n d floats a small dis-

Everything that is real is retreating into a diffuse mist
of unreality: his terrible thirst, the p a i n f r o m his eyes
a n d his blistered f a c e , everything is getting less i m p o r -
tant s o m e h o w . H e c a n still feel these sensations but
they s e e m far away, b e l o n g i n g t o a n o t h e r version o f
himself. Even his m e m o r i e s have g r o w n d i m : they are
sterile a n d dusty pictures in his m i n d , n o l o n g e r e m o -
tive. It s e e m s the w h o l e c o u r s e of his life is f a d i n g t o
b l a c k a n d white. Earlier he h a d d i s c o v e r e d that h e
c o u l d n o l o n g e r r e m e m b e r his t e l e p h o n e n u m b e r but
e v e n that h a d f a i l e d t o a r o u s e a n y e m o t i o n in his
sluggish m i n d .
Still, o n e m e m o r y a l o n e remains c l e a r in his h e a d
- o n e streak o f c o l o u r a m o n g s t t h e s h a d o w s . It is
strange that it s h o u l d b e this o n e e p i s o d e in his life
that is staying with him the longest, a n d yet in a way
he knows it is inevitable t o o . It was o n e d a y f r o m a
s u m m e r five years a g o . . . , no not a day, but o n e night.
It b e g a n with a k n o c k o n his front d o o r (there was
no bell). S e a n w a s in the kitchen, but w h a t he w a s
d o i n g before o r w h a t h e h a d d o n e earlier that after-
n o o n h e has n o r e c o l l e c t i o n of.
H e was expecting no one and tried to catch a
glimpse of his visitor from the window but all he saw
was a flash of yellow material. A skirt m a y b e ? H e
walked to the door and pulled it open. It was seven
o'clock in the evening.
"Hi." Said the woman who s t o o d o n his doorstep.
" C H R I S ! " h e a/most s h o u t e d it. "YOU! I wasn't
expecting...! mean...! thought you were...you said... "
he lapsed into silence and a lame grin which made bis
cheeks hurt.
"I told you I'd call on you." She leant forward and
pecked him on the cheek. Her smile dazzled: all per-
fect teeth except for her upper right incisor which was
slightly too short s o that you could see her tongue.
"You obviously don't take me very seriously. Look,"
she gestured to something at her feet, "I've got it all
packed...now all I need is your contribution."
On the ground was a massive basket, packed with
all manner of things. Right on top was a big bowl of
glistening lettuce, chopped onions and tomatoes.
"l...er...of course." Sean lapsed into his idiot's
grin again. "You want some wine, right?"
Chris nodded solemnly. "That was the agreement,
remember? Me food, you wine."
"Yeah, me Tarzan, you Jane," said Sean and
regretted it immediately. "Til just get it..." He said and
fled into the h o u s e . H e was muttering curses u n d e r his
breath as he entered the living room. On the big chest
of drawers stood two bottles of wine, only there
seemed to be four as they w e r e right up against the
big mirror which reached to the ceiling. They were
intended for his brother's birthday that Saturday and
were extremely valuable - they were from 1968, the
year of his brother's birth . Sean stood before the mir-
ror and stared himself in the eyes. Slowly his hands
reached for the bottles and a grin crept onto his face.
Forgive me, dear Brother, he said to his reflection.
Then he grasped the wine and ran back to the front
door where Chris waited.
Triumphantly he presented her with both of the
bottles. She took them and her brow creased as she
read one of the faded and soiled labels.
"Monsieur," she said and her eyebrows rode
slightly, "I didn't realise that I meant this much too
you".
"Oh!" Sean laughed, maybe a little too loudly.
"Think nothing of it, Madame. I always keep a little
something around for special o c c a s i o n s . N o w c o m e , /
a m h u n g r y . " A n d with that he grasped the heavy bas-
ket and they both walked towards the path that led to
the sea.
