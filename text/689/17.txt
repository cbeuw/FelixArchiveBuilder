Which i f passed, w i l l take e f f e c t from the s t a r t of next session.
THOSE OF YOU CURRENTLY IN YOUR FIRST, SECOND OR THIRD (or on a Four Year
Course) YEARS WILL BE AFFECTED. KID YOURSELF NOT.
I f your parents have a consumable income i n excess of £13,000, then they
w i l l have to pay more towards your grant and education. Don't be mistaken
- t h i s i s only the f i r s t step on the way to student loans.
Recommendations.

Union O f f i c e that you can use, as w e l l as names and addresses of M.P.'s.
2. Write to S i r K e i t h Joseph, Secretary of State f o r Education and Science,

Room Bookings
Over the years, the idea that rooms booked f o r whatever purpose may be
l e f t f o r "some-one e l s e " t o c l e a r up has been d i s p e l l e d , with such i n i t i a t i v e s
as the with-holding of bookings' deposits and withdrawal of f a c i l i t i e s .
THIS YEAR WILL BE NO DIFFERENT.
Union rooms and f a c i l i t i e s are f o r the use of members of the Students Union
and i t ' s clubs and s o c i e t i e s , subject to the terras and conditions of
booking such rooms. Their present c o n d i t i o n and state w i l l only be
maintainable i f users r e f r a i n from t r e a t i n g them l i k e rubbish t i p s and
leaving them a c c o r d i n g l y .
