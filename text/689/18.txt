RETURNING OFFICER'S REPORT,
DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
1. Posters & Events.
The general public are not allowed onto College/Union premises. This
is of paramount importance as regards fire precautions, safety and our
alcohol licences for which w
e (the membership of IC) are regarded as a
club. Any infringement of this could lead to judicial proceeds and/or
our licence to be revoked. Please do not put posters where they are
visible to the passing public; i.e. facing out onto the roads surrounding
us.
2. House Committee.
This year House Committee has decided to concentrate its attention on
the refurbishment of the top floor of the Union Building.
3. Refectory Committee.
The Union Bar is to be painted and wood surfacel polished over the
Christmas vacation. It will therefore be closed from Saturday 15th
December - Friday 4th January. Other major refurbishment schemes for
the bars are under active consideration.
4. Games Machines.
W
e are putting another video into the games room soon - either 'Defender*
or 'Hyper-sports'. A Juke-box m
a
y well be installed in the lounge if
negotiations proceed well.
5. Rape Alarms.
They are still available from me.
6. Safety/Accidents/Defects.
I a
m the Union Safety Officer. If you have an accident in the building
or notice a defect or dangerous occurence please come and see m
e before
someone gets hurt.
•7, Conference Office Equipment.
Gill Davies, the Conference Officer, and myself, after lengthy discussion
about the use of Conference Office equipment by clubs and societies
decided that it would be only fair to make a nominal charge for the use of
their tables at £1 each. W
e also agreed to ask for a personnel cheque of
£10 as a deposit against the equipment hired.
For the use of screens etc.. there will be no charge but a letter from m
e
confirming ICU's responsibility for the stuff is needed.
1. Ratifications.
The following vacancies have been filled since the last U
G
M and I ask
the meeting to ratify them.
Ordinary M
e

b
e
r of ICCAG - Kevin Yapp

U
C Delegate - Dave Kingston
INCOST organising Committee - Dave Rowe.
2. Aero Dep. Rep.
It seems to m
e that nobody in this department wants a representative.
The last time I looked there was one candidate w
h
o had two seconders
and n
o
w someone has removed the election paper. I shall be putting up
a n
e
w paper on the Wednesday morning after the meeting, December 5th.
I don't care if you have a Dep. Rep. or not,but I would hope that some
of you do.
3. Vacancies.
The following vacancies still exist;-
One Ordinary Member of ICCAG.
Handbook Editor.
Secretary to Academic Affairs Committee.
Nominations will be taken from the floor i f none are received before
the meeting.

N STUDENT GRANTS A
N
D FEES.
Proposed by: Mike Young, Chairman,
IC SDP Society.
Seconded by; Abigail Levin, Elec.Eng.2.
ICU Notes:
1. The recent proposals by the Secretary of State for Education and Science
to significantly raise the rate of parental contribution to student
maintenance grants.
2. The proposed introduction of part or full payment of tuition fees by
parents if their collective disposable income exceeds about £13,000.
3. The increasing financial problems of students in London, made worse by
the lack of suitably priced accommodation and the recent changes in the
student travel allowance.
4. 4
7
% of students do not receive their full parental contribution.
5. The principle enshrined in the Education Act of 1944 that higher education
in Britain should be free at the time it is required.
6. Demonstrations against the proposed changes are being organised by students
across the country, but as yet IC Union has made no significant response.

Y SECRETARY'S REPORT.
1. HallVs|Insurance.
Since the last U
G
M there has been a noticeable, although not staggering,
increase in feedback from people making insurance claims. I could still
do with more information although I a
m now satisfied that the n
e
w policy
is effective.
2. INCOST.
I have been extremely dissapointed by the complete lack of interest being
shown in this conference, especially those members of last year's Council
w
h
o were so enthusiastic that w
e should hold it. The attempt to set up
a formal organising committee was a dismal failure so it will have to be
done on a much more informal basis. If there is anybody w
h
o is interested
In helping in any w
a
y could they please come and see m
e in the Union
Office, there are a great variety of things which need to be done and you
don't need to know anything about Biotechnology, I don't.
3. Transport.
The organisational side of booking external vans as well as our o
w
n has
improved since the beginning of term although there is the inevitable
occasional cock-up.
The major problem is in the parking department - people persistantly
park in our soaces. W
e have recently (two days ago at the time of writing)
introduced a bollard system which should keep people out but it is too
early to comment on the success of this venture.
4. Parking.
The problem Is basically that an awful lot of people without permits
manage to sweet-talk their w
a
y past the guy on the barrier and
consequently there is insufficient room for those people with permits.
If someone is in your space tell the barrier attendant before you park in
someone else's. If it is a case of one person persistantly using the wrong
space come and see m
e and I will do what I can. There are N
O parking
permits left.
ICU Believes:
1. Education should be free in Britain, because it is a national Investment
in the future and should be independent as far as possible from a student's
background.
2. A large and increasing number of graduates are essential to the future
posperity and culture of Britain.
3. The proposed measures will cause students to rely too heavily on their
parents' financial support and will lead to increasing financial problems
amongst parents and students, discouraging and even preventing suitably
qualified British people from furthering their education.
4. The proposed dnagers are only the thin end of the wedge. Once the principle
of free education has been isolated and an environment of increasing
financial hardship created, the payment of fees could be extended to all
parents and loans schemes introduced. This underhand means could lead to
the establishment of a private school mentality in universities.
ICU Instructs:
1. ICU President to inform the Secretary of State for Education and Science,
and Peter Brooke M
P of the views of IC Union on this subject, and publish
the text of his letter in Felix.
2. ICU President to report back to the next U
G
M on the outcome of his action.
3. ICU President to write to the Education Spokesperson of the Labour, SDP
and Liberal parties urging them to oppose the proposed changes and support
the beliefs of IC Union.
4. ICU delegation to ULU G
U
C to put forward this motion at the earliest
possible opportunity.
ICU Requests:
All its members to write to their local M.P. and join in demonstrations protesting
about the proposed cuts.

M OF CHOICE.
Proposed by: Tim Williams.
Seconded by: Eric Derbyshire.
ICU Notes:
1. The motion on 'Freedom of Choice' passed at a U
G
M on December 6th
1983.
2. The reference to IC Union rooms in ICU Instructs 1. of that motion.
ICU Believes:
That this is unclear.
ICU Instructs:
That the word 'rooms' be replaced with the word 'facilities' such that
the final phrase n
o
w reads 'and that CCU's m
a
y use IC Union facilities
for any event*.
