It's amusing to see the antics that
next y e a r ' s p r e s i d e n t i a l
candidates are getting up to.
Jo Claydon standing on the
table singing 'Bestiality's best'; J
Martin Taylor wandering round
Southside with his clipboard,
noting who's got their door
unlocked.
But Hugh 'Huge' Southey has
already lost the massive 'IC
Radio block vote'.
Huge has been a D J since the
start of term and gets up the nose
of all the other DJs by playing
r e c o r d s b a c k w a r d s a n d
forgetting to have the news, and
so on.
Indeed it is widely believed
that Huge had to use his position
as Pub Board Chairman to get on
the air at all!
Imagine the surprise and
annoyance'of IC Radio members
when it was announced last week
that an elitist IC Radio Club was
to be formed, with Huge in
charge!
D J s w i t h m u c h m o r e
experience than Huge were
furious to find that they would
only be allowed to join if Huge
elected them!
As for Huge's sabbatical
chances, it is thought by some
that the title of his radio show,
'Spontaneous Incompetence',
says it all.

Safety first
Imperial College Safety Unit has
issued warnings about the
dangers of placing sharp items in
rubbish bins, and food, drink and
cigarettes in laboratories.
'Apart from being deep and
nasty, a cut inflicted by the sharp
edge of a baked bean tin, if
colonized by bacteria could
result in blood poisoning.
'The cleaning staff are often
victims of inconsiderate disposal
of waste,' say the Unit.
They warned people to keep
glass separate from other
rubbish, and to flatten tins with
sharp edges.
The Safety Unit have reported
the finding of food, drink,
domestic utensils and smoking
materials in a laboratory.
This is forbidden by an
Imperial College Code of
Practice, and in a radioactive lab,
by law.
The Unit reminds staff and
students that food and drink
should be prepared with
domestic utensils and consumed
in safe areas.
