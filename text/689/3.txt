Iceland
expedition
An IC graduate is to lead an
expedition to cross Iceland's
largest ice mass, the Vatnajokull,
on skis.
Anthony Hall, now a member
of staff in the , Centre for
Biotechnology at IC, and
Andrew Cummings, a third year
geology student at Goldsmiths,
are p l a n n i n g the s m a l l ,
lightweight expedition to
Iceland.
The Vatnajokull is not only
Iceland's largest ice mass but, at
over 8,400 km2
it is the largest ice
cap outside the polar regions.
M r Cummings and Mr Hall
intend to explore the mountain-
e e r i n g p o t e n t i a l of the
Vatnajokull as well as Iceland's
other ice caps and mountain
ranges.
As expedition leader Mr Hall is
currently applying to the
Imperial College Exploration
Board for approval and support.
He is also looking for sponsors to
help fund this challenging
venture.
Award for Biochemistry team
The College award scheme for
non-academic staff has been won
by a team from the Biochemistry
department.
Ian Blench (team leader),
Bernard Keene (engineer) and
Andrew Rawkins (electronics)
have designed and made the
winning entry, a microcomputer-
controlled gas-phase sequencer
for analysis of proteins.
The device, pictured, takes a
peptide chain, chops of one
amino acid at a time, and
converts it into a stable, easily
characterizable derivative.
T h e m a c h i n e is f u l l y
automated; a sample is put in and
a series of derivatives come out at
the other end after several hours.
Together with the Fast Atom
Bombardment technique already
practised in the department, this
machine is an extremely powerful
tool. Samples for analysis are
already being received from
universities throughout the
world.
The award citation noted the
'outstanding craftsmanship' of
the winning team.
