ICU at NUS demo
The National Union of Students claim that Wednesday's
'Going For Broke' rally was their largest protest since
1974. Although the police say that 8000 were present, the
NUS claim 30,000 with 1400 from Leeds University alone.
About 20 students from Imperial College attended
including President Ian Bull, Deputy President Dave Parry,
Honorary Secretary Eric Darbyshire, and External Affairs
Officer Jo Claydon. Ian Bull described the turn out as 'good
by Imperial College standards'.

The mass rally started in
Jubilee Gardens, South Bank,
with messages of support from
Clement Freud M P and Peter
Heathfield, General Secretary of
the N U M . After Phil Woolas,
NUS president, arrived the

Westminister Bridge in small
groups, to take 28,000 letters of
protest to 10 Downing Street and
to lobby MPs at Westminister.
Several hundred demonstrators
tried to break through the crowd
control barriers. This led the
police to close the bridge entirely,
cutting off the students who had
crossed the bridge from the main
body. This smaller group then
split, some lobbying MPs, some
led by Ian Bull and Dave Parry
marching to Whitehall.
On the South bank of the
Thames the main body split, and
tried to cross the river by other
routes. As the demonstration
crossed the other bridges they
blocked them, and at one stage
Westminster, Lambeth and
Waterloo Bridges were blocked,
throwing Central London into
chaos during the afternoon rush
hour. This was worsened when a
few hundred students tried to
block Parliamant Square, but
this was prevented by effective
police action.
On the South side of
Westminister Bridge about 1000
students were faced by 20
mounted police and 200
them held flares to provide light.
They were addressed by Phil
Woolas standing on the roof of a
bus shelter, and he claimd that
the NUS had gained a victory by
causing such chaos. During his
speech he was barracked and
called a 'scab' by the significant
proportion of demonstrators
who wanted to force confront-
ation with the police by storming
the bridge, and a few stones were
thrown at him. At one stage some

Polytechnic climbed 60 feet up
the side of County Hall and
erected a banner, to the applause
of the G L C staff inside.
After consultation with the
police M r Woolas asked the
crowd to disperse. Rumours of
mass arrests sparked-off a sit-
down by about 100 students, but
by this time the steady stream of
police reinforcements meant that
the police were able to clear the
bridge by sheer weight of
numbers, and there were no
arrests. Westminister Bridge had
been closed for over three hours.
Reports of arrests very from 50
to 180, but only a few were
charged, mostly with obstruction
or public order offences. One
policeman was slightly bruised.
Speaking that night in Bristol,
Sir Keith Joseph, the Secretary of
State for Education, called the
protest 'futile', and accused the
demonstartors of 'going on the
rampage'.
Carnival success
Last Friday's Carnival was a success, and for the first time for several
years made a profit, said the organisers.

One of the few casualties was Kathy, the Union Office receptionist,
who was detained overnight at St Stephens hospital after sustaining
concussion.
