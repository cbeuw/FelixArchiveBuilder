SINGLES
Gary Glitter: Rock and Roll
Christmas
The ol' rocker is still
churning out the same 'glitter'
music he was ten years ago.
Normally this would be a
recipe for disaster, but as a
X m a s p a r t y d i s c , t h i s
particular song is excellent.
With lots of sleigh bells, and
'Bop Shoowop's', it rivals 'All
Join Hands' as the sing along
for 1984.
Echo Base: Out Of My Reach
The UB40 label D E P has
recently signed its first new
bands, and this is its first non-
UB40 release. Moody, without
being pretentious, Echo Base
slide through 12 inches so
e a s i l y y o u ' d s u s p e c t a
banality, were it not for the
fact that the melody is
irritatingly catchy — I like it.
Give it a try yourself.
Thompson Twins: Lay Your
Hands On Me
I suspect this will be a
massive success, but I have to
admit that although it is
growing on me, I still find the
production very odd: it seems
as if the record is playing slow
the first time you hear it, and
'where's the toon?' as Paul
M c C a r t n e y used to say.
H o w e v e r , it d o e s h a v e
something... I only wish I
knew what!
Captain Sensible: One
Christmas Catalogue
How come it's only Xmas
that brings out the records?
Why not Easter records, or
e v e n 10 M a y r e c o r d s ?
Actually, the promotion girl at
A & M tells me this one is fairly
average for the captain. I
disagree. I think so long as it's
played LOUD, this could be a
big hit. The A A flip is his
version of 'Relax', which
varies little from the original
but is still interesting at least.
Human League: Louise
T h e a l b u m , ' H y s t e r i a ' ,
wasn't all that hot, and the
p r e v i o u s s i n g l e , ' T h e
Lebanon' was basically naff.
However, 'Louise', is brilliant.
Seems like everywhere you go
in London, there's some wally
trying to imitate Phil Oakey's
'As if we were still lovers' —
very often it's me. I love it.

RELIGION
Well, we've done sex 'n'
violence, so what's left?
Many of us have had powerful
r e l i g i o u s e x p e r i e n c e s —
knees on the bed, head
jammed into a plastic bucket,
'Oh, God, why meeee?'as last
night's over-indulgence flows
into view like a drowning
man's life. At such times it is
easy to wish for a less painful
way ot spending Sunday
mornings. J G Frazer (The
G o l d e n B o u g h ' abridged
edition, 1922) opines that the
major motivation in the search
for religion is fear of the
human dead, but we know
better, don't we, buttercups?
Shower of drunks.

Of course St Albert
Einstein of the Textbook
believed in God, and I will
grant that he did know quite a
few things that I don't. We do
take an awful lot in faith,
despite our rational upbring-
ing. For instance, how many
times have you heard the
theory that the world is a
statistical accident involving a
few gas clouds. A n d I'll bet
you believe it, too, credulous
half-wit. It must be as easy to
believe that God did the job
with a chisel, four screw-
drivers and a blob of Blu-tack.
'Aha!' cry the scientists,
'where did God come from,
t h e n ? ' ' A h a ! ' r e p l y the
believers, 'where did' the
fuckin' gas cloud come from?
Out of a bunsen burner?' And
they continue to explain that
any bloke who can part the
Red Sea, turn people into
pillars of salt and come back
from the dead is equally able
to come from anywhere He
likes. He doesn't need a
railcard.
The Power and the Glory
You can't venture far into
this subject without coming
across Graham Greene. He
has written dozens of books,
which he classifies as either
'novels' (the serious stuff) or
'entertainments' (the stuff he
wrote to make a living). It is
tempting to re-classify them
into 'overtly religious' and
'covertly religious'. As an
example of the first type, let's
look at 'The Power and the
Glory'. It is about a priest
trying to avoid persecution in
Mexico in the 'Thirties. He
hides among the population,
driven to drink, trying to avoid
his duties — partly out of
cowardice, partly out of self-
disgust. At one point he is
reduced to stealing a starving
dog's bone HEAVILY
S Y M B O L I C ! (Over the last
f o r t y y e a r s , h o w e v e r ,
Greene's writing has been
purged of s l e d g e h a m m e r
metaphor.) Eventually, the
Priest's inevitable martyrdom
does provide an inspiration to
a child, to whom the old
stories of Saints becomemore
real. The book contains all
Greene's favourite themes —
Faith, Hope and Love, and
why do people look for G o d
(or why do they not) — all set
out for all readers to pick up.
A s for style, he is in select
company. Some writers seem
to mistake long sentences for
d e e p t h o u g h t , or s e l f -
obsessed monologues for
insight. Greene avoids both
traps. Like Hemmingway his
prose is so simple that his
books can be read in the same
way as pulp fiction.
The Quiet American
One of the covertly religious
ones is 'The Quiet American'
which is set is Vietnam in the
days when the French, rather
than the Americans, were
getting the shitrain. The
weakness of the book is that
G r e e n e h a s c h o s e n a
j o u r n a l i s t as h i s m a i n
character. It could be argued-
that only a journalist is
allowed a detached view of a
war zone, but I am not the first
to point out that the artist-as-
hero bit occurs too often in
too many media. It can only
either be vanity or failure of
imagination. For the rest, the
book is clever. Greene has
obviously realised that one
writer's audience can only
takeso much pioussentiment,
and has avoided the problem
very neatly. His central
character is an atheist, which
allows him to smoke opium
and screw around. Cunning,
h u h ?
Smoke opium and screw
around
T w o s t o r i e s are
intertwined: the tragedy of the
idealistic Quiet American,
w h o s e i n n o c e n c e allows
terrible destruction; and the
equally tragic tale of the
j o u r n a l i s t ' s l o n e l i n e s s .
Although he 'defeats' the
American, we know that the
girl P h u o n g w o u l d have
married the American if he
were still alive. The victory is
incomplete. The religious bit
occurs through the desolation
of the journalist's soul. For
those that miss the signs,
Greene keeps feeding him
lines like:
'I have read of people's
thoughts in the moment of
fear: of God....I admire their
control'.
The book ends with the
journalist wishing that 'there
existed someone to whom I
could say I was sorry'. And if
that doesn't get the message
across, nothing will.
Perhaps I overstate. It is just
about possible to read his
books from a Humanist
v i e w p o i n t , s h o w i n g t h e
d i f f i c u l t i e s but s u p r e m e
freedom of breaking loose
from religion, but as Greene
was converted to Catholicism
it is safe to say that this is not
the way they were intended.
The Human Factor
If your idea of highbrow is
reading Le Carre intead of Ian
Fleming, have a look at 'The
H u m a n F a c t o r ' , o n e of
Greene's more recent works.
Superficially, it reads like
'Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy',
but on closer inspection you
will find two big differences.
Greene has something to say,
and the characters he uses to
say it really do have some
solidity — very real.
The story is of a man who
escaped from South Africa
with his wife. The man was
white, the woman black, and
B O S S didn't approve. He
escaped with the help of his
friend, who was a communist.
As an act of gratitude, he
agreed to pass secrets to
Russia. Thus the story is, at
heart, one about conflicting
loyalties rather than some
' c h e s s - g a m e ' i n t e l l i g e n c e
coup.
In short: coolerthan George
Smiley, more religious than
Albert Einstein, what more
could you ask?
'Not out chasing women
this weekend'?
'Course not old chap, the
new celibacy. God, you're
passe'.
(Penguin publish lots and
lots of Graham Greene's
books in paperback).
