The Bible, the Qur'an,
Science and Pork Chops
by T Sheriff
What is the connection between religious
scripture, scientific fact and your next pork
chop or ham sandwich?
For fourteen centuries believing Muslims
have refrained from touching pork in
obedience to God's prohibition against it in
the Last Revelation, The Qur'an. The
prohibition against eating or even touching
the swine has stood for almost 20 centuries in
the Bible, but the majority of its followers,
'the christians', have ignored it.
Analysing the Biblical injunctions
forbidding men from touching swine (Lev 11
v 7-8, Is 65 v 4 and Is 66 v 17) and the
Qur'anic (Ch 2 v 173; 5 v 3; 16 v 114 and 6 v
145) one can see that the reason for the
prohibition lies in the fact that the flesh of the
swine is an abomination and unclean, and
that the prohibition applies to the whole of
the animal, including its flesh, fat and bones.
Although at the time of the revelation of
these scriptures and subsequently, there
was no identifiable reason for the prohibition
other than that the injunction was from the
All knowing and All Wise Creator of the
Universe — and that was and is sufficient for
Muslims. Recently, science, the new'god'of
the West has come up with concrete
evidence to show that there are sound
biochemical and medical reasons for not
eating pork.
BIOCHEMICAL A N D MEDICAL
When consumed by humans, animal fats
are generally broken down into triglyceride
(TG) molecules, which are then further
hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase to yield
glycerol and free fatty acids:
The three groups (R1
R2
and R3
) can be
either saturated (S) or unsaturated (U).
Hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase is easy if R2
is
(U) but difficult if R2
is (S). There are eight
ways of arranging R1
, R2
and R3
in the T G
molecule; four have R2
(S) and the other four
R2
(U).
Experiments1
'2
have shown that the fat of
animals described as lawful for food in
Revelation eg sheep, cow, poultry, deer etc
have predominantly R2
(U) whereas pig has
R2
(S) — a characteristic it shares with
carniverous animals like the cat, dog, rat!
The consequence of the inability of
pancreatic lipase to break down R2
(S) i n T G
fat molecules is that it is absorbed as it is,
narrowing bloodvessels when it gets into the
bloodsteam — with the consequent risk of
Coronary Thrombosis and Arteriosclerosis1
— the major killer disease of the West.3
Thus, biochemically the pig is inedible, like
the cat, dog and rat!
The medical dangers in consuming pig
meat are perhaps not so insidious as the
biochemical ones cited above, but are
nonetheless alarming. The parasite, Tania-
soleum (a species of the round worm
Trichina which is unique to the pig) causes
Trichinosis in the human being if infected
pork is consumed. This disease has by no
means been overcome advice to consumers
to cook their meat properly or by attempts to
ensure that pig farmers feed their pigs |
'sterilized' garbage only.4

dirty pig is a scavanger which eats filth, muck
and rotting meat — converting this rubbish
into flesh, within three hours because of its
poor digestive system. It is no wonder that in
America for example, one in six people are
infected by Trichinosis, with 350,0004
new
cases reported annually, and in Germany the
situation is said to be even worse.
Interestingly enough, tricinosis as a human
infection is much less in the Tropics and the
Orient!

For Muslims, this scientific evidence is
welcome because in highlighting some of the
empirical facts about the nature of pigs, it
strengthens and confirms the faith in God.
The three main reasons why the 'Christians'
have ignored the order in the Bible to refrain
from eating pork are 1) the belief that the
coming of the Gospel cleansed all things; 2)
St Peter's 'vision' of a menagerie in which he
claims God asked him to slaughter for food
which ever animal he wished — the pig was
among the animals he saw and 3) The
historial fact that the Patriarch of
Constantinople at the time of Constantine
said that it is not what goes into the mouth
which is unclean, but what comes out. The
refutation of this first reason has come from a
Christian, Reverend C Leonard Vorse, who
in his book5
said that it is 'marvellous' that the
Gospel could have changed the natue of the
pig when there is 'no evidence' that people
have allowed it to change their own lives.
With reasons 2) and 3), 'Christians' have
permitted the dream of one man and the
presumption of another to overrule a clear
decree from God which was reiterated and
reconfirmed by the Qur'an, The Last
Revelation and by Jesus (on whom be peace)
by implication because he said 'I come not
but to confirm the Law of 'Moses' (Matthew).
So, would you stick your fork in pork when
it has been prohibited so clearly and
consistantly by God, and it has been shown
by science to be literally 'inedible' and
unclean?
