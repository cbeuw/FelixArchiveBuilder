Lost player
It was all so promising at the
start of term with many excellent
players turning out for training
sessions. As the weeks passed
less people attended.
The end result is only six
players for the U A U SE Regional
Tournament in Brighton last
weekend!
It's your fault if you had come
to training you could have come.
So in brief, here is the report:
Friday evening six players plus
injured coach. Two hours
search, extra player.
Saturday morning frost bite on
Brighton beach. Venue — eight
teams, two pools of four..Ours —
arch rivals Brunei and East
A n g l i a last y e a r s U A U
semifinalists.
Vs East Anglia. Uncle Nick
Nitchell hits from scoring 27
points. This, strong defence and
team work yield an unbelievable
61-66 victory.
Vs Brunei. Team spirit and
hard defence by all kept us about
level till five Brunei players had
fouled out allowing us to snatch a
fabulous 60-64 win!
Sunday all we have to do is
beat Sussex to go through. We
shoot the light out, swat their
shots and generally make
hamburger out of them in losing
by four points.
Three way tie for first in our
pool. Points differnce puts us
second in into a tournament
third/fourth play off vs LSE
The first half saw general
disarray and we were well down
41-25 at juice time.
Then we get into foul trouble
and play the last five minutes
with four players. We were not
disgraced, however, actually
outscoring LSE in the second
half in losing 87-75.
10-PIN BOWLING
No competition
To begin with, the A-team,
were beating their counterparts,
but since megastar Chris
Wheeldon didn't get a perfect
score, they lost. The B-team
came closest to getting any result
and the C-team....well, their best
player was nearly bowler number
five (there wasn't one!). Also, the
ladies' team lost. We didn't have
any of them, either!
Final Result — Southampton
10 IC 0
So don't forget, if you want to
join a club that is easy going,
doesn't cost the earth to Bowl, is
reasonably friendly, then bowling
is the sport for you. Any girls are
guaranteed a place in the Ladies'
team, so be at Chem Eng Foyer,
2.30pm Wednesday.
LADIES RUGBY
Resounding
The first match two weeks into
term served to initiate the new
members into the game. A good
first game, Finchley being a well-
drilled experienced team.
Next the team travelled
away to Warwick, having
practised hard since the shock
and inevitable pain of the first
match, and experienced a
resounding 20-0 win with the
celebrations to follow.
With a win under their belts
they next met Charing Cross
and yes, won again 19-0. Away
again back up the bloody M l to
meet Leicester Poly to lose only
4-0. Hindered by a sparse turn-
out of eleven players but a good
match all the same (should have
won that one girls!)
U C L gave their usual friendly
match beating IC 8-0 both tries
being scored in the first few
minutes and serving to wake the
team up having little get up and
go after the Guilds Carnival the
previous-night. From then on the
opposition was courageously
fended off.
ORIENTEERING
Churchill
warm-up
With the Southern Champion-
ships next weekend, the o-club
sharpened up their skills at a club
event on South Ashdown.
On this large open area
c o n d i t i o n s favoured fast
runners, though map-reading
errors cost dearly. Eppington
loped around to finish within
minutes of the winner; while
Foster is 'Wally of the Week' for
copying down his course in
'delible' ink, and having to call on
psychic powers to find the last
few controls.
In two weeks we'll annihilate
Oxford and Kent in the Churchill
Cup, so we'll need all orienteers
to be there.
BADMINTON
Nightmare
Ladies U A U Playoff'21/11/84
IC Ladies vs Brunei Ladies
We arrived safely, despite the
hideous experience (which we
just managed to survive) of
sharing a coach with the Rugby
Team.
IC first pair vs Brunels first pair
Despite the 'leaden shuttles',
our first pair gave us a good start
by winning 15-5, 15-8. Obviously
our superbly skilled pair were too
much for Brunei's feeble attempt
at an opposition!
IC second pair vs Brunei second
pair
Not only did the second pair
have to adapt to 'bionic shuttles'
( p o s s i b l y e v e n n u c l e a r
powered?), but this was their first
match as partners, and naturally
they took a little while to get their
tactics together, resulting in us
losing the first game 15-0.
Unfortunately for us, their
tactics were still a little uncertain
in the second game; they put up a
good fight, but managed to lose
15-8.
IC third pair vs Brunei third pair
As expected our third pair
didn't quite manage to beat
Brunei's third pair, but put up a
brave show to close 15-9, 15-8.
NB: It was at this point that the
thought that we might not
actually win began to impose
itself upon us.
IC first pair vs Brunei second
pair
No comment, but immense
embarrassment for our first pair
as they lost to Brunei's second
pair in three games: 15-13, 11-15,
6-15. Shame on them.
IC second pair vs Brunei third
pair
After a disappointing first
game which our pair lost 10-15, a
great come back started
materialising as our second pair
won the second game 15-8.
However, due to a slight drop in
our pairs' badminton standard,
we lost the third game 10-15; this
being yet reversed.
IC third pair vs Brunei first pair
Rather an appropiate quote
for game which was lost 8-15, 0-
15.
Nb: at this point the match was
lost!
IC first pair vs Brunei third pair
Another successful annihil-
ation of Brunei by our first pair
(and I should bloody well think
so!). The quote 'Alas poor
Brunei, I them well, I C (Hamlet
ed) could well describe the
opposition at the end of their
slight beating by our first pair: 15-
5,15-5.
VOLLEYBALL
Initial Success
U A U Championship
The newly formed IC Ladies'
Volleyball team made an
excellent start in establishing
itself as a respectable University
team on a national level on
Sunday. The event was the U A U
championships for the south
East and the venue was the
s p o r t s ' centre at E s s e x
University.
We had to start playing our
first match immediately, against
Brunei University. Some lovely
serving and consistent team
work won us the first set 15-5.
The second set contained more
excitement, since the opposition
decided to put up a fight, but
despite all their efforts, we
managed to beat them 18-16, and
thus won our first match. This
result helped us build up
confidence, which in turn
produced good results in the first
set against a very good team
representing Kent University. In
this set, we managed to get nine
points off the opposition. The
second set, however, was quite
disappointing in terms of results,
since the experience and
individual expertise of the Kent
girls, meant that we were unable
to launch successful attacks, and
thus match to the eventual
winner of the tournament 2-0.
We had, however, accumul-
ated enough points in the first
round to reach the semi-finals,
where we played against the
University of East Anglia.
The first set was very closely
fought for, but the lack of
experience on our part, led to us
losing confidence at the crucial
moment, and we lost it by only
two points. The second set also
went to the UEA, at 15-8.
Despite the fact that we did
not get through to the final, as we
had hoped, our girls' dedication
and hard-work means that great
amounts bf improvement and
achievement are on the way.
