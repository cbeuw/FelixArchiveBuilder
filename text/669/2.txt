Fight for
Better Pay!
Dear Sir
The letter from NUPE in
your last issue reflects their
concern for their members who
are in a low pay sector of the
Universities. We hope you will
press the College to answer it.
» Students will know that the
process of drawing conclusions
• from data has to be carried out
with care. Thus despite the
•''higher average costs for staff
other than NUPE members,
many of the ASTMS members
in the technical staff qualify for
social security benefits; for
example, free milk for their
children. Members of the
College staff with a son or
daughter at University
probably suffer the worst
financially since the student's
income to the family is so low.
Thus an immediate conse-
quence of the figures which
relate to staff costs but tend to.
suggest salary is that the plight
of students is far worse. The
logic of the NUPE letter leads to
the conclusion that all the
College staff should supple-
ment student grants, since
students are the lowest paid
sector of the Universities.
The truth of the matter is that
the premise of the NUPE letter
regarding the fixed percentage
of the College Income being
taken by wages and salary is
false. For most College staff
their salaries are determined on
a national basis and therefore
cannot be constrained by a
College policy. Also it is
common justice that those who
have a long training period
should have higher salaries
when at work so as to
compensate them for the long
period when they earned so
little.
We welcome the initiative of
NUPE in entering the generality
of the matter. The financial
strategy of the College1
regarding its staff is a general
area for debate. Consequent
upon this is the financial
strategy of H M Government
towards Universities, their staff
and their students. This is of
greater importance.
It is our opinion that
Universities should be in the
'investment' sector of the
economy and not in the
'charity' sector as they now are.
Only if such steps are taken by

the Government will it be
possible to deal adequately with
the question of low pay within
the University sector.

No Ransom
for 'Smelly
Beaver'
Dear FELIX
Having read your article on
the capture of Bruce the Beaver
I am writing to correct your
inaccuracies. LSE Students'
Union will not pay any ransom
in the near future until
everything is verified. In the
past Bruce has been kidnapped
by other colleges, most recently
by King's, but usually has been
returned without a ransom
being paid. One reason for this
is that the Beaver smells (not as
much now).
Incidently FELIX seems to
be suffering from an overdose
of student politics—a common
infliction. Every issue the letters
column is used by seasoned
hacks to slag off their
opponents. This should be
avoided if FELIX wants to be a
good student newspaper (unlike
London Student).

Peace
through
submission
to God
Dear Pallab
I read your article 'God
Exists—Official' in last week's
FELIX. Having also attended a
part of the Debsoc lecture in
which there was complete
discord between speakers and
the audience as to the question
of the existance of God, I
thought I must point out to all
those who are earnestly seeking
Truth that the Qur'an, the last
revealed Book (which unlike
the Old Testament and Gospel,
is still intact in its original
pristine form), answers the
question posed in the debate,
and goes on to give a complete
code of life for those who wish
to achieve peace through
submission to God both in this
world and the Hereafter. The
Qur'an is freely available and its
meaning has been translated
into English.

Why I
Quit-Neild
Dear Pallab
At yesterday's Hustings
U G M , I announced my
decision to stand down from the
elections for Deputy President.
This leaves the post to be filled
unopposed, by Dave Parry, the
present Vice President of RCS.
My reasons for standing, what I
hoped to achieve, and my
eventual reasons for with-
drawal were amply put in my
hustings speech yesterday, but
for those either absent or asleep
at the time I would like to
reiterate them here.
Much has been written and
said criticising the basic
facilities College provides for
the use of Imperial College
studens. However, this
situation is unlikely to improve
so long as College holds a
monopoly on the provision of
such services as refectories and
bars. It must be the aim of any
good student union to work to
provide the students,that they
purport to represent, with a
viable and accountable
alternative. In the past little has
been done to promote either the
furtherance of student union
accountability or the setting up
of an alternative to the Mooney
monopoly.
The temptation for all union
officials has been to seek their
answers to burning questions
through the College hack
Friday, March 2, 19841
inetwork, a network requiring a
cqnscious effort of opting in
and hence a concept of
excluding the vast majority of
students at Imperial. Little has
been done to try to break out of
this restrictive circle. Few dep
reps show any willingness to
fully represent their respective
departments on Union Council,
and no Union officials appear
to want to do anything to
change this, content to sit in
their office avoiding the trouble
of speaking to 'ordinary
students'.
In previous years when faced
with the clearly unsatisfactory
results producing by the
'Mooney monopoly' successive
administrations have either
proposed refectory boycotts
which never came to fruition or
have simply settle for
condemnation of Mooney
either in F E L I X or in
conversation. Unsatisfactory
though the refectories are, they
do provide a convenient place
to have a meal, and to many
people the convenience more
than compensates for the poor
value and quality. It is surely
now time for the students' un-
ion to make a positive move
towards greater independance
from College; it must look for-
ward to providing and running
its own independant refectory
and bar system, providing what
students want and making the
resultant system accountable to
the students themselves.
To campaign for and imple-
ment such radical changes to
the conventional view of IC
Union demands a committed
enthusiastic and determined
Deputy President. While I am
in little doubt about my en-
thusiasm and determination to
work towards the intro duction
of such changes, Dave Parry's
decision to stand for D. P. gave
me second thoughts about
standing.
In retrospect I believe that
Dave Parry would probably
make the better Deputy
President, his experience and
ability more than compensating
for my enthusiasm and
idealism. If however anybody
agrees with the points that I
have outlined above, I urge you
to fight to ensure that the
executive takes them up next
year, and that they take
Imperial College Union
forward to become a union
truly representing the interests
of its students.
Yours sincerely
Simon Neild
I FELIX
