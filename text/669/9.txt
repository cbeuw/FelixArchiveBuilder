organisations who can rival our offer to the
best Graduates of 1984.

Graduate looking for the opportunity to make
a personal contribution, Digital c a n offer a
fast-moving high technology environment

influence on progress and reward. Career
development is the rule. Movement a c r o s s the

wherever you start.

you'll be hearing from us soon and won't need
