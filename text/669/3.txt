Rag Week
The Rag Committee are to hold a
'Mini Rag Week' next week
following the success of the main
Rag Week last term.
Plans for the mini-week were
started last term and a list of
events was announced this week.
There will be three Rag collec-
tions in conjunction with other
London colleges and a number of
other events.
On Monday the collection will
be with Kings College, on Friday
with Q E C and on Saturday with
Chelsea College. Joint collec-
tions had to be organised because
IC Rag had left it too late to apply
for their owi. collection licenses.
There will also be a Hypnosis
Lecture and Demonstration by
Martin S Taylor on Tuesday at
7:00pm in ME220. For this there
will be a £2 entrance charge, with
proceeds to Rag. A n d on Tues-
day lunchtime there will be Silly
Games in the JCR. See your C C U
for further details. However, a
word of warning—it is rumoured
that Guilds Custare Pie Brigade
will be active during the week.

Tory Cuts
The College is to receive £28.08m
from the University Grants Com-
mittee as its recurrent grant for
1984/5 it was announced
recently. This compares with
£27.29m for this year and repre-
sents a 2'/2 % cut in real terms.
The effect on College spending
in areas other than salaries is
likely to be greater than a 2'/2 %
cut, however. A senior academic
in College has estimated the
result will be a 10% cut in
expenditure on teaching.
The College is presently for-
mulating all its response to the
UGC's questionnaire on the
future of higher education. A
draft reply was considered at a
Board of Studies meeting on
Wednesday and was approved
with minor alterations. It will
now be considered by the Gover-
nors at their meeting on 16
March. Professor Swanson, Pro-
Rector, who is co-ordinating the
response will be speaking about
the College's reply next Tuesday
at 1:00pm in ME220. F E L I X will
be bringing you more details of
the College's reply in a forth-
coming issue.

Not in Public Sean!
Next year's RCS Exec can't wait to get started! They
were ratified at the Results UGM last Tuesday and
they're just raring to go. Ann Collins was elected RCS
President with a majority of 256 votes and Sean Davis
was elected Vice President with a majority of 114 votes.
Paul Bloomfield (Hon Sec), Jane Ryder (AAO) and Paul
Richardson (HJT) were unopposed.
Laundry behind Schedule
The S o u t h s i d e C e n t r a l
Launderette will not be com-
pleted by the scheduled date, next
Monday. Don Clark, Estates
Secretary, said that the work was
'3 to 4 weeks' behind, and the
launderette will not now open
until next term. The new gym in
Southside will also not be ready
until next term.
The management of the laun-
derette will be undertaken by the
new Managing Surveyor (Resi-
dences), and the finances of the
service will be under the Resi-
dence Account. The charges for
washing and drying have not yet
been fixed, but they will take into
account the cost of providing the
facilities and for depreciation of
equipment.

NUS Debate
The motion 'This house believes
that I C U does not need the N U S '
I was narrowly carried on Tuesday
at a meeting jointly organised by
the Conservative and Liberal
societies.
Proposing the motion, Federa-
tion of Conservative Students
i Vice-Chairman, Marc Glenden-
! ning spoke of his main objection
! to the NUS, that many students
were forced against their wishes
to become members of an organ-
isation with whose policies they
did not agree. N U S Secretary
Jane Taylor opposing said that
all students could vote to deter-
mine whether their student union
was in the NUS. She claimed the
NUS was an effective voice
representing students.
Seconding the motion J Martin
Taylor, former I C U External
Affairs Officer, spoke of the
expense of N U S membership,
which would cost I C U over
£ 15,000. He said this would result
in severe cuts in Union spending
on student activities. Seconding
the opposition Philip Nathan (ex-
IC Liberal Club chairman)
claimed that NUS's work re-
sulted in large benefits to indivi-
dual students and student unions
which far outweighed the cost of
membership.
After speeches from the floor
the proposers made summing-up
speeches and on the vote the
motion was carried by a one-vote
margin.
Southside Halls to close?
The consequences of the recent
inspection of the Southside Halls
by G L C Fire Inspectors could be
far more serious than previously
reported. The College is to
receive a report from the inspec-
tors in about eight weeks time
which it is expected will call for a
major re-appraisal of fire pre-
cautions in the halls and may
include structural changes.
The inspectors are understood
to be worried by the staircase
layout of the halls since fire could
quickly spread up the stair-wells.
The layout of the gallery levels is
also a cause for concern and may
have to be altered by the
installation of extra partitions to
act as fire screens.
M r Don Clarke, College
Estates Secretary, would not
comment on the likely findings of
the report, saying he would wait
until the report was delivered to
College before making any state-
ment. He said that the inspectors
had asked at the time of their visit
for certain action to be taken
immediately, including the re-
moval of fridges, dustbins and
bicycles from the staircases. It is
thought they also made clear
their concern over the structural
layout of the building, but the
College is not required to take
action until the report is com-
plete.
The inspection was originally
requested by the College in view
of the increased use of the halls as
a hotel in summer. It is difficult to
see what steps could be taken to
alter the basic structure of the
halls, but it seems likely that the
College will at least be required to
break each stair-well up into
small units by the installation of
fire doors and screens to prevent
fire spreading. Another possi-
bility would be the installation of
more sophisticated fire detection
and control equipment. What-
ever steps are taken considerable
expense would be involved,
which raises the question of how
the College would pay for the
extra precautions.
Meanwhile on most hall land-
ings the fridges have been moved
to on of the side lobbies after the
inspectors' visit. However this is
only seen as a temporary solu-
tion, since it is thought unlikely
such a move would satisfy the
inspectors. A permanent solution
has still to be formed.
