In a dramatic gesture Deputy President candidate Simon Neild withdrew
his nomination at the end of his speech at yesterday's UGM. Mr Neild's
decision means that Dave Parry, presently RCS Vice President, is elected
unopposed as DP. Also at the meeting an appeal against disqualification
by Mark Cottle, who was standing for FELIX Editor, was quashed by 197
votes to 143 on a paper ballot. Mr Cottle was disqualified because a
manifesto which was considered to be in support of his campaign
appeared in Guildsheet, a direct contravention of the election rules.
The meeting started with M r noises to punctuate his
Cottle's appeal. Jim Boucher of
the E l e c t i o n s C o m m i t t e e
explained the decision and M r
Cottle spoke in reply. The ballot
was counted during the following
officers' reports and was an-
nounced before the hustings
began.
After the reports the meeting
heard speeches from five of the
six candidates for President. Jon
Barnett was not present, but a
speech was made by his proposer
Jon Taylor who urged candidates
to vote for M r Barnett or abstain.
Ian Bull spoke of his experience
and proven ability to be Presi-
dent, whilst Gareth Fish made an
outspoken attack on College, the
Union and bar prices, sentiments
which were echoed by David
Larrington. Aidon Jennery made
proposer's speech, and Paul
Simion promised to get tough
with College over important
issues.
The D P hustings took place
next. Srmon Neild spoke first,
and at the end of his speech he
dropped his bombshell and
announced he was withdrawing.
Mr Neild said that there were
many things he would like to see
done to improve the Union, and
that in talking to his opponent he
had found they had a broad area
of agreement on this. He was
standing down because he felt
that M r P a r r y ' s greater
experience would enable him to
be a better D P .
Dave Parry then made his
speech despite being now
unopposed. This was followed by
the H o n Sec candidates. Eric
Derbyshire spoke first, again
stressing his experience for the
post. Ian House spoke of the need
for the Union to support direct
student action much more.
The F E L I X Editor candidates
made speeches last. Adrian
James attacked this year's
F E L I X as being a poor copy of
Private Eye and Tim Noyce
thought F E L I X needed to be
bigger and to cater for more
tastes. Peter Rodgers committed
himself to improving the written
content of the paper, whilst Dave
Rowe promised to brighten up
the appearance of F E L I X which
had stayed much the same for
four years.
The remaining chance to hear
the candidates in action if you
missed the Hustings U G M is on
IC Radio on Friday evening.
Voting is next Monday and
Tuesday at ballot boxes in all
departments. You will need your
Unioncard to vote.
BINGO!
It seemed like an ordinary day for Peter Gwee of Physics
1â€”until he saw last week's FELIX Bingo number that is!
Lucky Peter could hardly contain himself w fieri he found
out that he had won the weekend for two in Amsterdam.
As yet Peter hasn't decided who to take with him hence
the presence of top Union freebie hunters, Teller and
Davis attempting to muscle in on the act at the presenta-
