Undergraduate Research Opportu-
nities Programme. Students interested
should contact them direct.
Dr R I Kitney, 811B Elec Eng
The application of signal analysis
control theory and computer
modelling to the study of physiological
systems and general biomedical
engineering problems. Either an Elec
Eng or Computer Science student
wanted.
Dr G H Kelsall, B312 Min Res Eng
Electrochemistry of (semi-)conducting
sulphide and oxide minerals,
electrohydrometallu rgical extraction
of metals from minerals, corrosion and
electrodesposition of metals, electro-
synthesis of oxidants and reductants

bubbles. Surface chemistry of minerals
and surfactant adsorption on minerals.
Drs L Pyle and H Michels 616 and 522
Chem Eng
The simultaneous movement under
gravity of solid and fluid phases poses
important process engineering
problems. We are developing a novel
process design which uses partial
fluidisation and we wish to extend the
work to include the influence of
physical and operating parameters on
the movement of the different phases.
The work involves studies on simple
experimental models, and, in parallel,
the development and testing of
theoretical models for multiphase
flows.
Dr M Spiro, 445A Chemistry
Reactions taking place at solid/liquid
interfaces: Heterogeneous catalysis of
solution reactions. Kinetics of
tea/coffee infusion Determination of
transport properties of ions in various
electrolyte solutions.
