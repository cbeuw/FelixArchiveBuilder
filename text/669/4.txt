Same Old Story
U G M Sketch
The excessive number o f
candidates for sabbatical posts
has gradually been whittled down
this week but that didn't prevent
yesterday's hustings reaching
epic proportions. The meeting's
length was matched only by its
boredom and necessitates the
awarding of the second annual
Agatha Christie This Meeting
Will Run and Run Award to
C h a i r m a n Passmore w h o
unfortunately asked seven or
eight questions to each of the
candidates when lesser men
would have settled for one. The
situation was much exacerbated
by Hon Sec Se^n Davis' burning
desire to disqualify a candidate
which he succeeded in doing
when the meeting upheld the
decision of both Executive and
E l e c t i o n s C o m m i t t e e i n
disqualifying Mark Cottle,
previously a candidate for
F E L I X Editor. Indeed it seemed
to take longer to disqualify a
candidate from an election than it
did to actually hear them speak.
This took about thirty minutes
and then the meeting quickly
moved through minutes and
officers reports—not even
stopping to point out that the
much feared Managing Surveyor
(Residences) has already been
appointed—the aptly named M r
P Hallworth will take up his
appointment o n M a y D a y .
They're a witty lot over in
Sherfield.
Only five of the six Presidential
candidates turned up on time and
broadly seemed to present the
same policy—a reduction in rape
alarm prices bought from the bar
at Harlington during rent
strikes—or something equally
ridiculous. In other words the
same old cliched policies—
doncha hate 'em!
There were slight variations on
this theme of course—Ian Bull
boasted o f his p r e v i o u s
Presidential conquests, Gareth
Fish and his proposer Steve
Higgins worried many by
pointing out they both had
picked up a nasty cold that
morning whilst Aidon Jennery
and partner La Iatrou presented
what was described by cultured
observers as a variation on an
idea by Viktor Borge.fcttherway
they all became rather tiresome.
People frequently complain
about the low standards of
writing in F E L I X but this
reached ridiculous proportions
yesterday as the concepts of
F E L I X Editor and journalist
became mutually exclusive. This
writer had hoped to sit in on all
the meeting to acquire material
for his customarily witty sketch
but his aspirations to become
F E L I X Editor led t o his
confinement in a small corridor
behind the Great Hall (under the
doe-eyed stare of new R C S U
President Ann Collins) for the
duration of the other three
candidates' speeches. Call it what
you will—vicious circle, catch 22
or just plain old tautology—but
doncha love it!
