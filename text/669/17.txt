This colour coordinated design based on a Renaissance Italian instru-
ment is brought to you at the incredibly low price of nothing, free, gratis
and given away. Demand is likely to be so heavy that we have to limit the
offer to one per household. However if you have a friend who would like
one, send his or her name and address to: 'Dramsoc Galileo Production
Offer', (Tickets available from the storeroom or any Dramsoc member),
Dramsoc Storeroom, Union Building with Â£1500 in cash to cover post
and packing.
Simply assemble as in the diagram, a hole in the pivot helps. Align the
date with the arrow on the backing plate. Find the plough (big dipper or
Ura Minor) constellation and within it the two star 'pointers' to the pole
star. Centre the dial over the pole star. Hold the leg of the plate vertically
and rotate the straight edge to the 'pointers'. Read the time from the
inner scale of the dial.
