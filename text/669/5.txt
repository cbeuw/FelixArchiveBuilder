How to apply to Halls and
Houses
If you have never lived in Hall or
a student House before, you are
likely to get a place if you are
going to be in your final year next
year, and a number of second
year new applicants are also
given places. If you have lived in
this type of accommodation
already and you intend to
reapply, remember that you only
have a 10% chance of getting in,
and also that the reapplicants are
selected by a committee for each
Hall or House, so there is little
point in applying to a different
place from where you spent your
previous year.

ACCOMMODATION GUIDE
It's March again, and it's time to start thinking about where
you're going to live next year, especially if you are after College
accommodation. College accommodation comes in two sorts:
Halls and Houses are buildings which are owned by the College;
Head Tenancies are buildings which are rented by College and
sub-let to you. In addition there are the Intercollegiate Halls,
which are owned and let by the University of London. Here is a
brief guide to what is available. For more information and
application forms, go to 15 Princes Gardens and see Anna or
Karen. It will also help to talk to people who have lived in the
accommodation where you intend to apply.
CLOSING DATE FOR APPLICATIONS IS 9 MARCH.

married couples
Rooms single
Hall facilities kitchens on every
floor. Common room, T V room,

Location Montpelier St, near

Advantages Location, cooking
facilities
Disadvantages You won't believe
how tiny the rooms are 'till you've
been inside one! There are no
washbasins in rooms. The
bathrooms have 2 washbasins, with
separate toilet and bath. It seems
students have no privacy when
washing (and this is a mixed hall!).

female
Selkirk 48 male, 24 female

one microwave for each Hall—also
the kitchens are tiny and cramped.

Rooms single with washbasin
Hall facilities lift to every floor,
kitchen on each floor, 1 common
room, bar, games room, garden.

(8 to a floor), large rooms.

Location 15 mins from College
Facilities kitchens, laundries,
dining rooms, common rooms,

basement of each.
Advantages and Dis-
advantages
The Houses are all quite near
College. M o s t rooms are
shared—there are just a few
singles for final year students and
postgrads. The atmosphere of the
all-male Houses can be rowdy.
The provision of kitchens is very
good—some Houses have
kitchens on every floor.
How to Apply for Head
Tenancies
You are only allowed to make one
application to Head Tenancies,
as well as applications to Halls,
Houses and Intercollegiate Halls.
You must apply in a group of the
right number of people for the
residence that you want. For
instance, if you apply in a group
of six, you cannot make another
application on your own. If one
of your group drops out in term
time, you must pay his/her rent
or find a replacement (however,
they must give you noice).
Get a yellow leaflet from
Student Services. This explains
all the forms you have to fill in.
Although many, if not most of
the rooms in flats are doubles,
the College disapproval of
cohabiting couples does not
apply!

The alternatives
If you have lots of money and are
prepared to take part in what is
more or less a lottery, you may
get a penthouse flat in Southside
or the Mews flat. The penthouse
flats consist of one large single,
one tiny single and one double
room plus lounge, kitchen and
bathroom. Laundry facilities in
the Southside Halls must be used.
The Mews flat has two double
rooms plus lounge kitchen and
bathroom.
Intercollegiate Halls, although
these offer good facilities on paper,
they have a major disadvantage
in that they offer compulsory full
board apart from weekday
lunches and they are all far away
in ULU-land (WC1, Blooms-
bury) so all though you get the
opportunity to fraternise with
non-scientists, you miss out a hell
of a lot of your IC social life. The
deadline for applications is 30
April 1984.
