owever different Ameri-
can healthcare is from
British healthcare, it
wouldn’t be unreason-
able to assume that the
principles of consent are similar. One
such principle is that valid consent
needs to be informed; one must be aware
of the implications of a decision to have
a procedure, the benefits, risks and so
on. When it comes to abortion, it seems
people cannot agree on what it means
to be informed. Some Americans feel
that to be sufficiently informed about a
decision to terminate one’s pregnancy
a woman must undergo transvaginal
ultrasound. They refer to this together
with the provision of other information
as “the right to know”.
Why would a transvaginal ultrasound
be performed in the context of abortion?
In Britain, it wouldn’t. Over here, trans-
vaginal ultrasound is used to examine
the womb, ovaries and other organs
for any abnormalities: it is a diagnostic
tool. Other than letting a woman know
she has a baby, which one suspects she
already knows, the purpose of the trans-
vaginal ultrasound in a healthy preg-
nancy was initially unfathomable to me.
The argument given by campaigners
for the “right to know” is “to ensure that
women considering an abortion would
be guaranteed access to independent
information and advice from someone
who had no vested financial interest in
the outcome of their decision.” At first
glance this appears innocent and even
Being informed and the Right to Know
moral and maybe it is, but some say
their motive is to discourage abortions.
Although it could have helped illus-
trate the issues, I will refrain from com-
paring abortion to any other operation as
such a decision is vastly more complex.
A better way to look at the compulsory
inclusion of transvaginal ultrasound
may be to disregard the controversies
surrounding abortion itself and focus
on what it means to be informed about
a decision. The objective of providing
information to make a decision is nei-
ther to condemn nor promote a choice.
In fact, it is unethical to impose an op-
tion on a person; that person has the
right to make autonomous decisions
regardless of how unwise that decision
appears to others. Absurdly it has been
said that the idea is to put a woman off
having an abortion by forcing her to
look at the image of her foetus. Maybe
they haven’t checked but even if one
could justify why a woman should be
persuaded not to have an abortion, this
experience is highly unlikely to change
her mind!
Before anyone goes as far as to say
that denying a woman a transvaginal
ultrasound is depriving her of vital
information that she needs to give in-
formed consent, perhaps they should
ask themselves two questions. Firstly
does it override a person’s autonomy
to include dissuasion in the process of
informing consent? And secondly is it
acceptable for an invasive procedure
such as transvaginal ultrasound, which
is of no visible benefit to any party, to
be a hoop through which a pregnant
woman must jump before she can have
an abortion?

Organ donation: is it selfless or selfish?
D
on’t worry. I’m not go-
ing to intimidate you
with statistics in order
to convince you to give
your organs away at
death. Nor am I going to persuade you
that you’ll be needing them in the af-
terlife. It is after all your body and it’s
really none of my business what you do
with it.
But I wonder if you have ever con-
sidered that organ donation might not
be that selfless but in fact a little self-
ish? At the time of writing (this is 2012
A.D.), no elixir of life has been invent-
ed. At most, we can hope to live into
our early 100s. Pledging our organs
at death however gives us functional-
ity beyond the grave, the closest we
can get to immortality. One human can
save or greatly enhance multiple peo-
ple’s lives, a rare occurrence in every
day life, which means you (well, part
of you) could yet end up as prime min-
ister, an Olympian, a Nobel laureate
or even all three. Look at it this way:
it’s a reassuring security that on death,
your entire being and purpose doesn’t
evaporate instantaneously. And it’s a
security that comes both for free and
with minimal effort: all of two min-
utes registering online. So it comes as
a surprise to me that more people don’t
listen to their selfish side and embrace
this option.
The Welsh government are currently
moving towards an ‘opt-out’ system of
organ donation in which people are au-
tomatically placed on the organ donor
list unless they object. This method,
although likely to get some apathetic
people donating who otherwise might
not, is unlikely to change someone’s
mind that is already set. Tackling how
and why people make their decision
whether to donate or not are, in my
opinion, far more important. Education
could remove the mild taboo surround-
ing organ donation discussions allow-
ing people to engage with opinions on
both sides. This would allow us to make
a more informed decision without feel-
ing forced into donating. If, however,
this new legislation clearly removes the
opportunity for family veto, a chance
for family members to go against the
wishes of the deceased, I am in favour
of this move; I certainly would not like
my selfish security to be taken away
from me by a relative at the last minute.
Needless to say, my selfish argu-
ment cannot extend to people who give
blood, stem cells and live kidneys. Yes
you might get a bit of a buzz like Nich-
olas Crace, the oldest living kidney do-
nor at 83, did, who explained that: “It’s
nice to feel in old age that one can still
be useful”. And you might get a (great-
er) chance to be part of a rock group or
the cabinet. But achieving these things
takes time, effort and discomfort. These
are surely selfless acts of kindness and
those who help other people in this way
are in my eyes the true heroes.
Stephanie Walton Think about it. If you donate an organ you could become part of a rock star
or Nobel laureate. Or if you’re Brian May, maybe even both
