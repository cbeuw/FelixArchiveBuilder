This week, scientists at
Imperial discover a coded
message embedded in Brian
Cox’s faeces. Unfortunately
agents from Warburtons
get to them before they can
publish the findings, leaving
this horoscope without any
punchline whatsoever...
So remember, boycott
Warburtons...
This week, you realise you’ve
entered the friend zone. You
look to the horizon, you can
see titties. You put your ear
to the ground, you can hear
a girl orgasming. But you’ve
got next to no water left, and
no shoes either. It’s a long trek
back to civilization, but you
can make it, young trooper. I
believe in you.
Thisweek,youdiscoveranew
incredible, unbelieveable,
earthquake-inducing way of
slicing bread. Unfortunately,
before you can tell anyone,
agents from Warburtons
kidnap you, and specifically
remove your tongue, eyes,
arms, and legs. The secret
will die with you, unless you
learn to type with your dick...
This week, you look back over
your first year at university
and think, “Man, that was a lot
of fucking”. You get your cam-
era out and start reliving the
best moments. “Damn, I can’t
believe they let me film it!” you
say to yourself. Suddenly you
wake up in the library, people
are staring. Your shorts are
nowhere to be seen.
This week, an eagle swoops
into your room and pro-
claims, “Come with me, and
we’ll save the planet togeth-
er!” You do as he says and
hop on. He wisks you away
over London, and as the sun
sets the eagle gets his phone
out and says, “You’ve got
the gang, I’ve got the bang.
Awww yeah...”
This week, you go to the
opera with “the lads”. HIlarity
inevitably ensues but you are
quietly moved by the beauty
of the singing. During the
intermission you strike up an
intellectual conversation with
a girl at the bar. You’re about
to ask for her number when
she says, “Man the opera is
so gay”. You die a little inside.
This week, you’re caught up
in some serious rioting at
the Euros in Poland. You go
into defensive mode to pro-
tect yourself and your fam-
ily. Whenever anyone comes
near, you politely but firmly
ask them to move away, lest
you call the police. You wake
up hours later in hospital, your
family is missing.
This week, you’re watching
Ms Dynamite at the Summer
Ball. When she’s introduced
as Ms Dynamite, everyone
shouts “Tee hee!” When she
says “What’s up Imperial?”,
everyone shouts “Tee hee!”
When she asks everyone to
stop saying “Tee hee!”, well
you get the idea. Imperial,
let’s do this. Are you with me?
This week, a guy in the com-
puter suite is checking you
out. Well that’s putting it mildly.
He’s taking photos of you, and
he’s shouting “boobs!” You’ve
had enough. You walk up to
him, beat him to the floor, and
shove your fist up his ass. As
you rip out his prostrate, you
scream, “THIS IS SEX, YOU
VIRGIN FUCK!”
This week, you’re having a
coffee at Starbucks. Your
skirt flutters in the wind as a
man enters the shop. Your
hair falls casually to one side.
Your eyebrows raise in antici-
pation. Your hand grabs the
knife. Your foot kicks the table
over. Your body leaps up. You
shoulders drive the knife into
his neck. Too much coffee...
This week, you wake up beat-
en and bruised in a Polish
hospital. Your family is miss-
ing. A mobile phone rings
beside your head. “We’ve got
your daughter”, the voice on
the phone rasps. You tremble,
but then regain your compo-
sure and tell the person, po-
litely but firmly, that you are
going to phone the police...
This week, you’re a Syr-
ian soldier, hanging out with
some kids in a village. Sud-
denly a kid grabs a grenade
from your belt and runs off.
“No!” you shout, but it’s too
late. As you run towards the
grisly remains, you trip and
fall, accidentally firing your
rifle. Shit! Another one...
[That’s enough, Ed].
Rector Wears Dalai
Lama's Face, Interviewed
by Louis Theroux
The Rector shocked alumni recently
by turning up at a fundraiser wear-
ing Buddhist robes and the bloodied
face of Tenzin Gyatso, a.k.a. the Da-
lai Lama.
One alumni who attended the
event described the atmosphere as
“strangely serene” and said that Sir
Queef seemed “at peace”.
However, the move may go some
way to raising Imperial College’s
profile. Sir Queef is set to feature in
Louis Theroux’s latest documentary
Bath salts and why faces are tasty.
The documentary is rumoured to
include a lengthy conversation with
the Florida zombie’s re-animated
corpse.
In other news, the Chinese
Embassy issued a statement
slamming the Rector for meeting
with the Dalai Lama...
Union are ''Massive
Stupid Assholes'' says
Scathing Court Report
In unrelated news, The Litter Tray
criticised for excessive paraphrasing
Last week, for the first time in living
memory, Union politics became
interesting. The Sabbatical Officers
were torn to pieces by the Union
Court in a vicious 16-page beat
down of its plans to change the way
your Union is governed.
They attacked the Sabb’s ability
to form properly constructed
sentences, saying that the
proposals were poorly drafted
and at one point said that certain
changes did “not make grammatical
sense”, adding “we are at a loss to
understand what it means”.
The bits that were comprehensible
didn’t fare any better. Proposals
to stop students overseeing
elections contained “depressing
assumption[s] about students’
abilities to be mature, neutral
and fair“ and summarised the
plans as a whole as being
“plainly undemocratic” and an
“unprecedented” power shift away
from ordinary students.
The issues were discussed at Union
Council, or rather they talked about
talking about it. And then agreed to
put it all off until next year. That’s good
old student democracy for ya... President Scott Heath spotted trying to improve the Union...
