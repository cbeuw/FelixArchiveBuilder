UNION
AWARDS
2012
It’s always nice to socialise with your friends
and to go out for a few drinks now and then,
however it is important to be careful and be
aware that there are people out there who will
sometimes take advantage of people who are
out for a drink.
One of the biggest problems in London’s bars
is one of drink spiking; this involves someone
putting something into your drink that makes
you feel bad or in some cases makes you
totally unaware of your surroundings.
There have been cases of men and women
being sexually assaulted due to drink spiking.
There has also been instances of people being
mugged. It is important that whichever bar
you are in ,whether it be the Union, or another
bar, that you are aware of where your drink is
and that you trust anyone you leave your drink
with.
If you wake up the morning after a night out
and you have a complete memory blank of the
night before it may be that your drink has been
spiked. In this instance it is advisable that your
go to your local A and E department; they may
be able to do some tests to find out if certain
drugs are in your body.
Below are some top tips to be aware of when
you are on a night out:
• If you go to the toilet ensure you leave
your drink with someone that you trust
like a good friend, never ever leave it with
someone who you have just met.
• If you are on your own in a bar or pubs
waiting for friends always keep an eye on
your drink, even take it to the toilet with you
if you need to.
• Although it is often tempting to accept an
offer of a drink from someone always ensure
that you only accept drinks from people you
know and trust. In drink spiking cases it is
often people who you have just met that
spike your drink.
• Find ways to cover your drink a lot of pubs
give out bottle tops that you can put on your
drink.
• If you an unsure that something may have
happened with your drink then leave it.
• If you feel dizzy or sick ask someone you
trust to help you or call an ambulance
• Never drink a drink that you haven’t seen
bought or poured.
• Ensure that you always know where your
drink is if you walk away and it is in a
different place don’t drink it.
If the worst happens and you or a friend have
a drink spiked please ensure you inform the
management of the pub most places will
have first aid qualifications and will also call
an ambulance if needed. If you find that your
drink has been spiked and you have been
sexually assaulted or have been a victim of
crime it is important to inform the police. In
some cases of sexual crime people aren’t
always happy approaching the police so below
this article is the number of the havens who
can help you with various issues that arise
from this.
It is very hard in some cases to tell if your
drink has been spiked as your drink will often
not smell or taste any different but if you feel
sick, sleepy, confused or more intoxicated
than you should be for the amount you have
drank ensure that you inform the bar staff or
someone that you trust that you are feeling
unwell.
When on a night out the message is be aware
of your surroundings and also be careful of the
establishments you choose to drink in. If you
feel unnerved or something is not right then
leave straight away.
These tips are intended to give you general
help if you need further info on drink spiking
