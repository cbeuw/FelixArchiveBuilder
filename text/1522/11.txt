t’s summer; exams are over,
there are parties to go to, holi-
day destinations to jet off to,
and of course, the Summer Ball
to attend. For many of us, all of
these occasions probably warrant new
clothes.
Given the emphasis placed upon
sustainable living nowadays, however,
there can’t help being some guilt at-
tached to a trip to Westfield when you
know you are funding an industry that
promotes a throw-away philosophy.
The realm of fashion is well known for
its somewhat lax stance on sustainabil-
ity, characterised by fleeting trends that
seem to come and go each month let
alone each season. In some respects it
seems that, because of this trait of the
fashion world, extravagance and waste-
fulness are inextricably a part of it, but
does it have to be this way?
In recent months there have been
many signs that the fashion industry
may be redeeming itself of its wasteful
reputation. In March, H&M launched
their Glamour Conscious Collection
featuring clothes made from sustain-
able materials like hemp and recycled
polyester. In April, Marks and Spencer
unveiled their new Schwapping Lab,
endorsed by Joanna Lumley, where
people can give and buy second hand
clothes. Even better, this month, in
fact today, Topshop are launching their
Capsule Collection: a range of clothes,
designed in collaboration with the eco-
friendly group Reclaim to Wear, made
Vogue en vert
entirely from discarded materials in-
cluding fashion industry surplus such
as cut-offs.
In order to do some vital ‘research’, I
paid a visit to the Oxford Street H&M
and Topshop stores and although it’s
great that these green ranges have been
launched, there was hardly any sign of
publicity for them either in the shops,
or in magazines or on TV. Sadly, sus-
tainable fashion still doesn’t seem to be
considered glamorous enough to make
the headlines. Even more disappoint-
ingly, Topshop’s recycled range will
only be available at the Oxford Street
store. It seems that, although celebrity
endorsements, and events such as Livia
Firth’s Green Carpet Challenge, en-
couraging celebrities to don recycled
fashion items at red carpet events, are
raising awareness on the issue of sus-
tainable fashion, there just isn’t enough
enthusiasm from the big brands.
On the bright side, living in London,

fashion we have some of the best destinations
for vintage clothes shopping in the
country, with places like Brick Lane
and Camden market on our doorstep
there’s plenty of opportunity to shop in
a way that’s kind to the planet if not our
pockets. If you do have some free time
today though, Topshop is the place to
be, their brand new range is the perfect
excuse to hit the shops, after all how of-
ten can you say you’re shopping to save
the world!?

Letter to the Editor
It’s quite extraordinary how, by run-
ning for Gender Equality Officer on an
abolitionist manifesto, and having the
misfortune to be male, one is assumed
to be a troll or ‘joke’ candidate. I didn’t
win the election, but I have no doubt
I did much better as a result of these
attacks. So helpful were they in fact, I
decided I didn’t even need to campaign
– they’d done all the work for me.
I am very much in favour of equal-
ity. I despise discrimination in all its
forms. For example, I abhor so-called
‘positive’ discrimination. In a merit-
based society there should be no such
thing – surely all discrimination is
wrong?
To illustrate with an example: In
1997, 101 female Labour MPs were
elected to the House of Commons. It
was lauded at the time. But far from be-
ing a step forwards for equality, it was
two massive steps backwards. Many of
these women were selected as Labour
candidates on the basis of all-women
shortlists. That is to say, they were
chosen otherwise than purely on merit.
Far from empowering these women,
it meant they could not look their col-
leagues (both male and female) in the
eye and say “I’m your equal” because,
quite simply, they’re not. Compare and
contrast with women like Margaret
Thatcher, who was not selected based
on her gender, and who beat the grey-
haired men at their own game – and on
merit. She is the real feminist.
Perhaps where I differ from the
standard Student Unionist concept of
‘equality’ is that I sign-up to the idea
that people are individuals who should
not be assigned to ‘groups’ based on
their sex, sexuality, or race. Indeed, I
think that doing so is a backwards step.
That is why I am against many of these
Officer posts in ICU which seek to as-
sign people in such an unnecessary and
artificial way.
Surveys which ask me to ‘identify’
myself based on my race, orientation
or gender are ignored. I will not be la-
belled in such a way. People, as free
individuals, identify themselves by
their actions and deserve to be treated
accordingly.

The perfect excuse to get yourself to Topshop today!
Cat got your tongue?
There is always plenty of time to
get involved, so relax. Oh, wait,
hang on, the issue next week is
the last of the year. Okay, so if this
year you said you’d write you should
start panicking like an Apprentice
contestant writing a CV.
