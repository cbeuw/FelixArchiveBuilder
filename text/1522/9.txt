COMMENT
FELIX Alter your behaviour
Heather Jones
You can’t deny that the Union isn’t care-
fully considering the financial onset of
this year’s Summer Ball. Regrettable as
the cancellation of the on-campus Formal
Dinner was to those preparing their own
formal attire, the decision will not have
an impact on the financial success of the
event, with the tickets having been sold at
cost price.
Although the dinner was to be held at
the lowest price available with College
catering, students, as reported in Deputy
President (Finance & Services) Michael
Foster’s Council Report, “voted with their
feet”. This is unlikely to evolve into a stu-
dent-led revolt, with events already being
organised to hold pre-Ball events at other
establishments.
And despite all of the controversy at this
week’s Council and a lack of attendance
at last week’s General Meeting, it’s worth
remembering there have been a variety of
significant outcomes from the Union this
academic year. That is, aside from Council
discussing an issue for a significant period
of time and not really getting anywhere at
all.
Following a new Impact Report detailing
the Union’s recent successes, one can
recall the highest turnout across England
and Wales for a Student Union election,
with an overall turnout of 41% across col-
lege, with 58% of undergraduates and 19%
of postgraduates voting. Next year’s offic-
ers will be representing the largest man-
date yet.
Volunteering at Imperial has been given
a new lease of life with a new partnership
between the Union and Student Hubs,
which is discussed at length in this week’s
feature.
Technological advances such as the
long-awaited lecture podcasting and note
storage facility NoteBox will be thoroughly
introduced following influence from the Un-
ion and suggestions of students.
Representation has seen a boost follow-
ing February’s Love Your Rep week, with
further support set to be provided to reps
in the future.
And a cash machine returned to Beit
Quad, so that’s a bonus right there.
So, while the usual Union hackery can
never truly be avoided, ultimately signifi-
cant advances have arrived during this ac-
ademic year. And anyway, it may well be a
pity that the Summer Ball won’t be playing
host to a Formal Dinner may not be going
ahead, but at least there won’t be a loss
generating from it.
Summer Ball so hard
Formal Dinner can’t find
me
It seems like everyone suffers from the thoughtless acts of a minority. By which it is meant
the poor behaviour of individuals discussed in the article, not the people riding horses
... it’s not just the
victims of this
abuse that suffer
because of it.
Men are treated
like dangerous
pariahs and are
afraid to strike
up conversation

T
his morning I realised that
something has fundamen-
tally gone wrong. Having
finished exams I was wan-
dering around in Hyde Park
after a delicious coffee with a friend
and noticed the horses from the Hyde
Park barracks practicing. I went over to
watch and was being impressed by their
formation horsing when a gentleman
with a huge smile came up and asked
me what they were doing. My reaction
was a sinking feeling wondering how to
extricate myself.
The reason? Over the last five years
travelling in London and around the
country to visit friends and relatives, a
good proportion of approaches by lone
men have turned out to be excuses to
harass, proposition and inappropriately
touch me for having the misfortune of
being a lone traveller. There was the
occasion on a packed train when the
gentleman in the aisle seat chose to “test
the quality of my skirt” – also known as
stroking my thigh. On another occasion
a young gentleman spent three and a
half hours incessantly enquiring how to
contact me; Facebook, my phone num-
ber etc. in spite of me asking to be left
alone – apparently playing hard to get.
On one particularly repugnant occasion
I was travelling with my younger sister
and a gentleman accompanied by his
teenaged son felt the need to proposition
us and enquire after our sexual prefer-
ences and practices for a full two hour
journey. We didn’t have the heart to tell
our grandparents what had happened
upon arrival.
Of course, the vast majority of jour-
neys are uneventful and everyone con-
ducts themselves appropriately, but as a
result of these unpleasant incidents I find
that every time my attention is drawn to
a lone man on public transport there’s a
sinking feeling that my journey is about
to be disrupted. It’s worth mentioning
that poor behaviour is not always direct-
ed at women, though the sexually moti-
vated component in my experience is. I
have also seen a man headbutt another
man for the audacity of using a shared
armrest and two men removed from
public buses by police (on separate oc-
casions) after becoming violent follow-
ing the usual slight nudges which are the
by-product of overcrowded transport.
I focus on public transport as a par-
ticular problem area but in truth crowds,
queues and even our very own Union
bars have all been areas where I have
been touched inappropriately and with-
out permission. When three gentlemen
who study at Imperial have all felt it OK
to cop a feel without invitation I begin
to believe that these men are everywhere
and so upon being approached by a lone
male stranger my heart sinks. For the
minority who are reading and may ben-
efit from this information, I and every-
one else will let you know if we want
to be touched, propositioned or harassed
by you. Please desist unless you receive
this information, it will be clearly sign-
posted, you won’t miss it!
The problem is that it’s not just the
victims of this abuse that suffer because
of it. Men are treated like dangerous
pariahs and are afraid to strike up con-
versations unless accompanied in case
they come across as interested for the
wrong reasons and the little pleasantries
that can make public transport so much
more bearable become sinister to every-
one due to an unacceptable minority.
The gentleman watching the horse
dancing with me in Hyde Park was just
curious and I think a little put-off by my
unfriendly demeanour. He ambled off
after a little while, resisting the need
to proposition me or slip in a sexually
themed joke. Unfortunately I was less
friendly to that curious person just want-
ing to know who the horses were and
why because some men out there simply
do not know how to behave.
I’d welcome any thoughts readers
have on this theme and particularly ideas
as to what can be done about it! Perhaps
if more of us showed our disapproval
these brutes would learn their behav-
iour isn’t acceptable, I always find that
the pithy put downs come to me only
after the incident but in case inspiration
strikes you please don’t hold back!

percuts then
