Bursaries and awards
and on what basis resources are pri-
oritized”. Concerns were raised over
the overall quality of the draft, with
Jaimie Henry stating that the changes
represented “massive substantial re-
forms that need a lot of scrutiny.”
Responding to Felix regarding this,
Scott said: “One thing I would person-
ally like to highlight is that many of
the comments harked back to an age
when Student Unions were very dif-
ferent and many of the Court’s ‘points
of fact’ were not so. A good example
of this is criticism that the title “Ac-
tivities” is not common for the officer
that assists clubs and societies. It is
actually a common title used in the
UK.
“As well as this, criticism of Sab-
baticals being on the Trustee Board is
weak, especially considering that ev-
ery counterpart Union in the Russell
Group has Sabbaticals on theirs with
Cardiff and Sheffield having eight of-
ficer trustees, Southampton and War-
wick having seven and Bristol, Leeds,
Newcastle, Oxford and UCL having
six. Furthermore, of these Unions,
eight do not have student trustees ei-
ther as elected or nominated. “
As the session of Council did not
have enough members present to
reach quorum, resolutions could not
be passed into action at the meeting.
Discussions duly moved to email res-
olutions in order to provide necessary
changes ahead of the next academic
year.
This session of Union Council also
marked the ratification of this year’s
Union Awards. As the session was not
quorate, the ratification had to be con-
ducted by an email version of a secret
ballot. This year, 129 individuals were
nominated for Union Awards, with 87
being deigned by the Colours Com-
mittee to be worthy of receiving an
award.
The majority of the student-based
Colours Committee also received
awards, though the members in ques-
tions left the room during the con-
sultation process and also “abstained
from voting when they felt a conflict
of interest against a nominee,” ac-
cording to a note from the President.
In other Union-related news, the re-
sults of the Union’s Bursary Review
have been analysed, with several rec-
ommendations being made to College.
This marked the second time that
the survey had been run. Among the
results on offer, it was declared that

An article last week (Issue 1521 – The
Litter Tray – ‘Imperial Learns Mean-
ing of Irony’) featured the statement:
“the remaining plant sciences re-
searchers at Silwood are, understand-
ably, looking for career opportunities
at institutions where their efforts are
appreciated for more than opportunis-
tic press opportunities.” Felix recog-
nizes that this statement is completely
untrue and unfounded.
In addition, Felix apologies for any

Cars should be fit-

of 35 micrograms of alcohol in 100
millilitres of breath. Professor Nutt has
said that it “could save a lot of lives”.
The Department for Transport have
claimed that they are not planning to
install such devices as they are “diffi-
cult to manage” due to the fact that it is
possible to fool the sensors and the De-
partment is “not persuaded as to their
effectiveness in changing long-term
behavior”.
Professor Nutt is a professor at Im-
perial College London as well as being
President of the British Neuroscience
Association. He has been a campaigner
for science in policymaking for a long
time; a trait that lead to his dismissal as
the Chair of the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs by the then Home
Secretary Alan Johnston.
In particular, he has been very out-
spoken about what he perceives to be a
disparity between harm and classifica-
tion in the UK’s drug policies. In par-
ticular he has written a paper in which
it states that alcohol and tobacco are
more harmful to society than illegal
drugs such as cannabis, LSD, and ec-
stasy. In June, he will be appearing in
front of the Home Affairs Select Com-
mittee to discuss the current drugs pol-
icy in Britain and what changes could
be implemented.

Department claims it would be “difficult”
this academic year there has been a
100% uptake of bursaries.
Among the recommendations that
the Union is making to College, it is
recommended that support is raised
by moving more funding away from
fee waivers to cash and cash equiva-
lents. It has also been suggested as a
result from conversing with students
that marketing material is provided at
a more convenient time in application
cycle for students.
Regarding the bursary recom-
mendations, Scott commented: “I
am remarkably proud to be part of a
University that listens to the recom-
mendations of the students that rely
on bursaries when designing the fu-
ture support. The College has been
very welcoming of the participation
of the Union, listening to everything
we have had to say. This is something
which many of my counterparts can-
not claim and a true sign of where we
can work constructively. I would also
like to thank all survey participants as
their involvement was essential to for-
mulating a credible report.”
