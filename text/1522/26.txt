Nonogram – Bug Panic
The cells in a grid have
to be coloured or left
blank according to
numbers at the side of
the grid.
The numbers meas-
ure how many unbro-
ken lines of filled-in
squares there are in
any given row or col-
umn. Look at last
week’s solution to see
what a typical solution
looks like.
The overall solution
should yield some sort
of picture, or as good
as a picture can look
in monochrome on a
15x15 grid.
As usual, answers to
puzzles.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk.

The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots. The
numbers in each square indicate
how many edges of the square
are part of the loop, so if it con-
tains a “2”, you know that two
and only two out of four edges
have lines. That’s all the info
you need to get the one logical
answer (though waiting a week
to see the solution will also
do). Answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, as the puzzles
team recieves one hour off for
summer per correct solution.
