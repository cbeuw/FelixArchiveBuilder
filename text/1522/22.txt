Greek Salad is dish known worldwide. Many
restaurantsinLondonincludeitintheirmenus,
even if they don’t do Greek cuisine, and most
probably you have tasted it at least once. Most
people may think that there is no specific rec-
ipe for a Greek Salad. If you consider a Greek
Salad to be just tomatoes, green leaves and
feta cheese, like the one from the JCR and the
Library Café, then you need to take a look at
the recipe below that includes all the ingredi-
ents you need and some useful do’s and don’ts.
What you need
1) Medium sized tomatoes
DO NOT use rotten tomatoes, put them aside
for Italian pasta.
2) Cucumber
Any kind will be fine. Besides, it adds more
freshness than taste.
3) Red onion
No specific clarification is required here. Just
be sure to pick the right one for you: not too
mild, not too strong.
4) Green pepper
DO NOT use red, orange, or any other kind
of pepper.
5) Feta cheese
In the UK, people tend to use creamy feta
cheese. DO NOT use it though. Feta isn’t sup-
posed to be creamy.
6) Extra virgin olive oil
If you decide to be stingy at this point please

1 tablespoon milk
For the cream

abandon this recipe. DO use the best olive oil
you can find and if you don’t manage to get it
send me an email and I’ll get you some from
Greece in September.
7) Vinegar
Optional. Used to add taste. DO NOT use bal-
samic!
8) Oregano
Like vinegar, it gives taste. As before, if you
can’t find good oregano, email me and I’ll
ring my grandpa to cut some from Cephalo-
nia’s mountains.
9) Kalamata olives
DO NOT use any other kind of olives, espe-
cially not any green olives.
Procedure
Here’s the thing: there shouldn’t be a pro-
cedure. Greek Salad is synonymous to sim-
plicity, so the least time it gets you to cut
the tomatoes, cucumber and peppers, peel
the onion and spread the feta cheese pieces
the best your salad will be. That said I am
not implying that you must rush. Just keep
in mind to choose the right ingredients and
good olive oil. Lastly, don’t forget possi-
bly the most crucial thing when it comes
to enjoying a Greek Salad properly: the so-
called “papara” (probably the easiest Greek
word to pronounce after “malaka”), which
is fresh bread literally soaked in the left
over mix of oil, vinegar and traces of feta.
PS: If you’d like to taste real Greek Salad
but don’t want to bother making it yourself,
visit Greece in the summer. Islands are com-
pletely safe, despite Athens I must admit,
and well… sun is free and always present!
That’s how it should look.... ...and this is where you should be!
Procedure
Preheat the oven at 180°C. Oil a 9-inch pie
dish. Crush the biscuits and add the sugar and
melted margarine and milk. Press the biscuit
mixture in a 9-inch pie plate and bake for 8
minutes. Let it cool and remove it from the
pie plate. To make the cream filling, com-
bine the tofu, salt, vanilla extract, lemon ex-
tract and lemon juice in a blender. In a small
Summer sweetness: Lemon Pie Recipe
saucepan, combine ½ of the milk and the agar
powder, cook for 5 minutes stirring occasion-
ally. Add the sugar, milk and cornstarch in a
cup and whisk. Add this to the simmering soy
milk mixture and stir for about 5 minutes. Add
the cooked cream in the blender with the tofu
and the other ingredients and blend until very
smooth. Pour it immediately into the baked pie
shell. Refrigerate for at least three hours.
