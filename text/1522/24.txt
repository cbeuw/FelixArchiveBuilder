Fulham Housing
Market Crashes As
Library Opens 24 Hours
A Day All Summer
House prices across Fulham are in
free fall after the Central Library an-
nounced plans to remain open 24
hours a day for the entirety of the
summer.
Hordes of students, ecstatic
about the free accommodation,
high-speed internet connection,
and minimal social contact that the
library provides, are abandoning
their flats and preparing to live full-
time in the Library.
One student has taken advantage
of the situation to organise what he
terms, “The LAN Party to End All
LAN Parties”. Demand is rumoured
to be frenzied...
The library management says that
it will deal with students living in the
library “stringently”. Plans include
declaring the floors to be lava,
shouting “grenade!” at random
times, and nipple tweaks for any-
one found sleeping in their chairs.
News in Brief
Horoscopes get over
100,000 views on Reddit.
This is actually true...
In a bizarre email last week,
eternal tease and disappointment
generator Robert J Carpenter
declared that he was nothing more
than an invention of “your feeble
little mind”. Fortunately for him,
no-one read the rambling missive
as his email was automatically
deleted...
Student Takes Horoscopes Too
Seriously, Likes It...
Jimmy Yoruba has had a
rollercoaster ride of a week. It
began last Friday when he read the
Horoscopes and said to himself,
“Hey, I’m an achiever. I can achieve
this. I’m not a failure, I’m a winner.”
The Litter Tray caught up with
Jimmy seven days later. His eyes
are slightly sunked. He looks
pale and tired, like he’s endured
significant blood loss. But despite
the missing teeth, there’s a broad
smile across his face.
“It’s been an incredible experience
– I really feel alive now,” he told us.
“I’m taking a couple of days off and
then getting back on this week’s
horoscopes on Monday. YOLO!”

Queen's Lawn
Reopens
The Queen’s Lawn has finally recov-
ered from the triple Jägerbombs it
did over Easter and has reopened
this week. “Never again man, I’ll
never drink again – a conference? I
do like conferences... Fuck it, get me
a quadruple jack and sambuca...”
Pun of the Week
On 8 June, an email was sent
around Imperial, asking people to
keep their windows closed in case
the high winds fucked with them.
Robin J Leatherbarrow’s reply,
cc’ing everyone: “Sounds like a
wind up...”
We salute you, sir.
Robert J Carpenter? Nobody can
see him! Nobody’s ever seen
him! Even I’ve never seen him!
OMG HE’S BEING BURNED BY THE LAVA!!! On the other hand, he’s
protected from the grenades. Either way, NIPPLE TWEAK!
