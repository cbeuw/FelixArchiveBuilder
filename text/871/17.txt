Grants not loans
Last chance this year
Loans are coming in next term - you are going
to need them!
We offer grants in the form of phased
contributions to financial plans directly relevant
to student objectives - so take advantage!
You can make some financial provisions now and
use SGFPD's grant to prepare for the future.
We can show you a way to guarantee a top-up
to a 100% mortgage (subject to status) so you
can avoid saving a deposit for your first house.
Take the SGFPD grants that are still on offer
whilst they remain available.
The amount of grant to which you are entitled
can be advised by telephone or personal visit,
or by post if you complete the attached
enquiry card.
