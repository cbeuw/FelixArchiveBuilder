Soviet, American and Chinese workers (all drawn from
places equivalent to Imperial College) apporach the
many problems which science can help address? The
2nd International School on Science and World Policy
will be held in Princeton, New Jersey, between
August 6-16. Students and staff from Imperial College
will be working with people from all over the globe
and political spectrum in learning about and
attempting to solve these and similar problems.
The school follows on from the highly successful
one held in Moscow last summer, organised and
attended by nine people from Imperial College.
Lecturers included key figures from the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, the Beijing Institute for
International Affairs, and US and British experts on
arms control and environmental issues.
The Princeton School will be even more
international, and will draw on its own experts and
bring in people from other countries as before. It will
be hard work, but if the Moscow School is anything
to go by, extremely enjoyable.
If you are interested in going to this school, or want
more information, please contact Dr Jenny Nelson in
the Physics Department as soon as possible. All travel,
accommodation and most expenses will be paid for,
but there are limited places available.
You might not have noticed, but despite being forced
to cancel Rag Fete, things have still been happening
this term.
Wednesday 23rd May saw Poppy the goat arrive
for her regular shit on the Queen's Lawn-contrary
to popular belief, she was not eaten at the last Rag
dinner. Her bowels were fairly inactive for most of the
day but, true to form, she eventually got up and
dumped everywhere and refused to leave. Many
thanks to Serita (Chem 2) who finally charmed her
back into the van, and to Mark, Murray and most of
the Guilds Motor Club for the transport. Pete Bowen
(BioChem 2) correctly spotted the first dump and wins
a massive prize (probably).
Telethon was the last event of the term, on Sunday
and Monday (May 27 and 28). On Saturday a hardy
bunch of collectors flaunted all the major collecting
laws of the city and went on a 'Monopoly Board' pub
crawl-a pub on each property on the Monopoly board
(27 pubs). Unfortunately, the Tequila Slammer race
in each pub didn't happen, so no-one gave themselves
chronic liver failure. However, over £600 was raised
for Telethon.
On Monday, Rag sent a small group of people,
including Union President, Neil McCluskey, to the
main Telethon site at Docklands to organise Mud
Wrestling with a difference-in burger relish (brown

existing layout plans. The room classification and the

About 8 students at a time are needed
