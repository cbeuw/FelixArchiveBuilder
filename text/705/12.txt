The literary
magazine of ICU
Peter Klemperer, RCS Academic Affairs Officer-Elect
talks about
Life, the University and Everything...
The Government uses the University
Grants Committee and the National
Advisory Body to ensure that education
money goes only where they want—hence
the summary axing of all 'unnecessary' non-
vocational courses in recent years. They
want to centralise control of higher
education so that first they can make sure
that all these academics have no political
power, and second so that they can twist
education away from its ideals towards being
a preparation for performing some
predetermined r61e in the political machine.
This is a bit odd for two reasons: first how
come they can so freely manipulate what is
ostensibly a public service, and second they
depend heavily on education for a steady
supply of trained people in order to
perpetuate this ghastly rat race. Here, there
are two obvious points to note. ..
Political weight depends largely on the
competitiveness of the economy and its
technological bargaining power, in which
Science plays a central role. Imperial College
plays an important r61e in Science. Nobody
should go through this College without
considering carefully how and why it is here.
The NUS supports the fundamental ideas
that general education, to maintain a wide
FEUX
range of informed points of view, is vital in
our society. As the society evolves and
becomes increasingly complicated, this
policy becomes increasingly justified. They
(we?) believe that education is an important
investment and deserves ample funding in all
respects.
The NUS is currently starting a national
campaign designed to augment the role of
higher education over the next ten years as
our country pulls out of the current
economic depression. They have various
means of communicating their ideas to
students, so that they can assimulate a better
picture of the scene in higher education, and
so that they can collect a wide range of ideas
for ways and means.
Imperial College is not a member of the
NUS. However we are in the University of
London Union (ULU) and the London
Students Organisation (LSO) and the NUS
communicates with us via them. Our
Academic Affairs Officers play an important
part here—there are the people who get
invited to discussion sessions at ULU and
attempt to put forward the point of view of all
the students they represent.
There are four AAOs in ICU: one for each
College Constituent Union (RCS, C & G ,
Friday 24 May 1985
RSM) and one big one for the whole of IC. Of
course they are not there merely to
communicate with the NUS. Their primary
functions are College-orientated; they help
to see that students get a fair deal by keeping
themselves well informed and protecting
their interests on various committees,
namely
1 Board of Studies
2 Education Technology
3 Admissions Policy
4 Vacation Training
5 Careers Advisory Service
6 Central Libraries
That is, basically everything concerning the
academic situation of students at IC.
They also endeavour to keep everyone
they represent up to date by whatever means
is at their disposal notably Academic Reps
and FELIX.
So you see that your Union performs an
important and useful function. You may
dismiss it out of hand as a bunch of
wallybrained 'hacks', but this is only a small
proportion. We must all be aware of its job
and help it where we can. The basic problem
is one of communication; but however bad
you may think this is, its all you've got—so
use it!
