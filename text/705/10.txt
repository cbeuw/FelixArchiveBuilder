The College has also been well
represented at international level
with the lightweight IV winning a
silver medal at Ghent, and the
tireless J O'Brien coming a
creditable fourth in lightweight
scull. Both G Griffiths and W
Downing will hopefully be
representing Great Britain in the
lightweight World Champion-

On the

•
On Wednesday 8 May Imperial
College Golfing Society held
their annual club championships
at Sudbury Golf Club.
In the first 18 after much
drama Dave Jakubovic returned
a well deserved net 69 to take a
narrow lead over the rest of the
field at the half-way stage.
However he could not maintain
this form and Dave Lang who
had shot a net 71 in the morning
proceeded to follow this with a
net 69 for a total of 140, to be
declared club champion. The
best round of the afternoon
however was the shot by the
retiring club captain Phil Hughes-
Narborough who shot a net 67.
Another notable achievement in
the afternoon was the net 70 shot
by the incoming captain Chris
Harrison.
Other excitement during the
day included S Nakamura's shot
along the road at the first, M
McBride's 12 at the first and Bill
Passmore's double-triple bogey
at the par 3 ninth. Phil's and Jeff's
'fun' activities in the under-
growth are also worthy of note.
Finally to all club members the
tour to Scotland will probably
take place in the first week of
September. Notification of dates
and location for this will be given
in the next three weeks.
CRICKET
IC win
the day
Wednesday 22 June: news has
just reached us that Mr Peter
May, Chairman of the England
Selectors, has been in contact
with the Sunday XI Captain,
Graham, after his performance
in the Sunday's match against
Imperial Software Technology.
'I hope he'll take up our offer,
not for the money,' said May,
'but for England'. The offer in
question is a payment of £50 and
a set of autographs of the entire
1984 Glamorgan Cricket team,
in return for Graham agreeing to
never play cricket again. 'How
can we encourage good, new
prospects, when this sort of
example is being set by
Captains? He bowled con-
sistently short on a slow pitch,
which at this pace meant the ball
ramming through at waist level,
instead of knee level. It's a
wonder he gave away only 12 off
his first over', May commented.
The match itself was marked
by four exceptional perfor-
mances. By far the most
significant was made by Wendy,
who provided a lunch/tea which
hasn't been equalled since the
MCC last played Hambledon.
Our sincerest thanks go to
everyone who helped prepare
the spread, which helped provide
a spirit that was ideal for a
friendly cricket match.
On an overcast day, the IST
captain elected to field first. This
was agreed by both captains
because their wasn't a coin
available to toss. IC made a
sound start with Wright, making
his UK debut, managing to
overcome the base-ball stance.
The innings was due to last 20
overs, and when Barnet fell in the
second over for nine, Rickard
took over the assault with a rapid
40. Rijneck (19), Bradley (25) and
Lauder made contributions, with
Bradley being LBW off a ball
pitching outside leg stump and
going over the wicket. This
brought in Miss Brown, who
would have taken the attack
apart had that not been the end
of the innings, with thw score at
118-5.
After tea, IST made a
spectacularly sound start, with
the first wicket falling in the
seventh over, at 87. By this time
Greener had scored 36, and
Dixon went in to make 48 out of
107 in the 20 overs.
After more tea, the second
innings of ten overs commenced,
with the batting order reversed.
Indeed, it was left to the umpire
to tell the captain, who was
opening the batting, which way
round to stand. But fortunately
he was soon out for a season's
best score of two. This brought
in Jeynes, who in eight overs
smashed 44 runs before retiring
for yet more tea and letting Katy
have another bat. The final over
of the day was bowled in
traditional manner by the wicket
keeper wearing pads, while
batsmen and replacement
keeper wore none!
Throughout the day, the
fielding had been of the highest
standard. Two IC men received
an injury, but the Americans and
Canadians on both teams saved
many runs, even if they weren't
totally sure what was happening.
Finally, as everyone retired to
tea, with the clouds handing
ominously overhead, the IC
captain announced that the
Sunday XI will be playing on
Saturday next weekend, at
Harlington against Silwood Park.
Come on Mr May, up that offer,
Please.
Scores: IC 118-5; and 71-2, IST
107-3 and 57-7. IC won by 25
runs.
