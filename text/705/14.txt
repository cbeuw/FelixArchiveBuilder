• S U M M E R IS upon us, and
that means postcards. By
autumn most of us will have
managed to accumulate a
selection of tatty cards which
we will not hesitate to throw
out. Well, to see the real thing
go to the Collector's Mart
under the a r c h e s near
Embankment Tube. There
are one or two stalls selling
Nazi memorablia and other
stuff like that, but enough
with interesting matchboxes
and postcards and the like to
make it worth a visit. In
particular the cards of sleepy
seeside spas in the 1920s are
excellent value, many being
less than 50p, and with the
current jazz revival there can
be few things to put on your
wall that are more hip.
• T H E R E D GUITARS play
the U L U building at 8.00pm
tonight. Billed as 'Britian's
top Indie band'this is theonly
London date on their current
tour. Supporting them are
Terry and Gerry, whose
recent song Clothes Shop
sank without trace despite
being the best singalong
single this year. Tickets are
£3.50, and the U L U building
is in Malet Street W C 1 .

• T H E R O Y A L A C A D E M Y are
showing works by Edward
Lear. For all their chaos and
frivolity Lear's pieces always
seem to have a faint air of
sadness, which should give
the exhibtion an added edge.
Admission is £2, and the
R o y a l A c a d e m y is in
Piccadilly.
There are a whole pool of
apocryphal stories to dip into
which have common themes.
One favourite of many students is
the gruesome gory type of story
where a teenager ends up either
getting an axe between the ears,
or getting very close. The trouble
with these is that there are so
many, each with many
variations, so are very few that
everyone knows. However here is
one with many of the common
features.
A teenager has borrowed his
father's car and is parked in a
forest indulging in some pretty
heavy petting with his girlfriend.
As things start to get really hot a
newsflash comes over the radio
saying that there is a homocidal
maniac on the loose, who has a
hook instead of a hand and get his
kicksfrom goring people to death
and defiling their corpses. At this,
not surprisingly, the girl gets
ratherfrightened, and goes as cold
as ice. The romantic atmosphere
dispelled, the boy starts the engine
of the car and revs offin a temper,
intending to take his now frigid
companion back to her parent's
house.
Anyhow, on the drive back they
both cool down, talk it over and
make up-they were in no danger
were they? When they reach the
girl's home the boy gets out and
walks round the car to let her out.
Hefinds, on the door handle on the
passenger side a hook with the
bloodied stump of an arm.
As in all tales of this type the
teller has indulged in a orgy of
gory adjectives in attempt to
make your stomach turn, telling
you what the homocidal maniac
does with the corpse and the like.
Notice that only the girl pulling
away from actually having
intercourse saved their lives. And
that none of this would have
happened if they hadn't been
indulging in pre-marital sex.
Let that be a lesson to you if
you're going to any post-exam
parties.
