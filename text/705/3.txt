Symon Corns, Roger Preece and Dave Page lead a Boomalaka at the end of the Guilds
Handover UGM. Highlights of the day were Luke Walker's award as Angel of Guilds and
the traditional trouserless boat race. Neil McCulloch was most surprised to be awarded
RCS half colours for services to the President. Observers were left wondering how one
achieves RCS full colours.
Not bust
CITY A N D GUILDS Union have
revealed that they are not
bankrupt after all. This follows a
contingency claim to IC Union at
which time they claimed to have
'run out' of money.
IC Union finance Committee
decided to loan them money
from next year's subvention, to
clear their debts.
It now appears that the
apparent crisis was caused by the
double entry of a large debit in
the accounts.
Guilds H J T David Sharpe has
been seen sporting a black eye
recently.

Guide to
Head
Tenancies
RESIDENTS of Hamlet Gardens
have produced a guide for dealing
with their Head Tenant, Imperial
College.
The document was produced
after a six-month delay in
repairing a leaking roof.
The guide suggests that
contacting Student Services is
much more effective than dealing
with Student Managers. Student
Services will usually ring the
owner of the flats if a student has
a problem, say the residents.
They also point out that
students can get free legal advice,
particularly on housing, from
Law Centres.
The nearest Law Centre to
Hamlet Gardens is at 106-108
King Street, Hammersmith, W6.
F E L I X will print the whole of
the guide next week.
