Logorrhoea
Sir
M r Garside in his letter last
w e e k o m i t t e d s e v e r a l v e r y
important points, that I feel it is
my duty to correct. Firstly, D r C
T Onions' book ' A n Etymology
of the English Language' gives
the word 'betray' as deriving
f r o m the L a t i n ' T r a d e o - e r e ' ,
from which we also have such
words as 'Trader'—surely an
honest occupation.
Secondly. I fail to see how M r
Garside can refer to Webster's
'Usage a n d Abusage' without
mentioning Heinrich Splitter's
a u t h o r i t a t i v e w o r k ' T h e E t y -
mological Derivations o f E n g -
l i s h f r o m G e r m a n W o r d s ' .
While admittedly Herr Splitter
does not actually mention the
w o r d i n q u e s t i o n , s u c h a n
omission on M r Garside's part is
totally unforgivable.
Finally, M r Garside cannot be
unaware o f m y A m e r i c a n col-
league Professor J C r u m b l i n g -
S w e a t s h i r t ' s b o o k ' R e a l l y
amazingly obscure, ludicrous or
j u s t p l a i n s i l l y m e a n i n g s o f
everyday words', which attaches
to the w o r d 'betray' a symbolic
meaning that (while I shall not
mention it in the columns o f this
w o r t h y j o u r n a l ) M r G a r s i d e
might d o well to research.
I a m . Sir, delighted to have
been able to clear u p this little
matter.
Yours faithfully

Dear Martin
The recent articles i n F E L I X
s u g g e s t t h a t t h e r e is n o w a
considerable amount o f interest
I i n — a n d ignorance about—the
I N a t i o n a l U n i o n o f Students at
I I C
-
The matter is important and
' concerns not only those o f us
i studying here now, but future
| g e n e r a t i o n s o f s t u d e n t s . T h i s
surely merits the cost o f a £300
campus-wide referendum o n re-
affiliation.
T h e U n i o n c a n a f f o r d t o
spend ten times this amount o n
repainting the central staircase
in the U n i o n Building. Further-
m o r e , there is a U n i o n c o n -
tingency fund of £9,000 available
in reserve f o r j u s t s u c h u n -
budgeted expenditure, should
the need arise.

Dear Martin
H a v i n g trudged wearily back
to m y h o v e l a f t e r a t a x i n g
morning sitting around talking
to people (all elfin properties
being somewhat lacking due to
the weather and the fact that I
had to breakfast before 9:30), I
shambled across to the letter-
rack, and l o ! I beheld a letter.
W i t h a c e r t a i n a m o u n t o f
trepidation (ref C & G President)
I fumbled with the contents.
Was it this quarter's edition o f
'The electronic calculator a n d
marsupial fanciers' gazette'? O r
perhaps, joy upon joy, the latest
circular from the R o b i n D a y
F a n C l u b . C o u l d it be (at times
l i k e t h i s , o n e ' s m i n d a l w a y s
turns to the more fundamental
desires) that a n u n k n o w n Peru-
vian great aunt h a d left me a
small fortune i n sloth furs? M y
mind raced.
Unfortunately it transpired to
be a final demand note f o r m y
H a l l fees, which wouldn't have
been quite so peeving if I hadn't
paid them weeks ago.
Determined to rent m y frus-
tration upon some unsuspecting
bureaucrat I strode forcefully
into the Students Services Office.
M u c h to my disappointment I
was totally deflated by a very
a p o l o g e t i c g e n t l e m a n w h o
explain there was a lot o f it
about, and they were calling in
rent-to-kill next week. By way of
explanation he showed me a
singularly unimpressive, large,
dog-eared string o f paper with
lots o f biro o n i t .
The reason? Computers, of
course.
Yours ironically

C o n s i d e r i n g that t i m e s are
hard for I C U (!) it would seem
t h a t , r e l a t i v e l y s p e a k i n g , the
price o f a democratic choice i n
the matter is perhaps not so
expensive after all.
