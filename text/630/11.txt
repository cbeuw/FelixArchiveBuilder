RSM
ICLUBS & SOCIETIES!
Thanks very much to everyone who came out
on Morphy Day and completely fed the other
two mobs in the battle. It was all the more
convincing considering R C S didn't even use a
van and so both they and C & G were going for
the same one. Anyway well done and don't
worry about C & G claims of possessing V 3 r d of
the oar as they obviously didn't know its original
length (but what do you expect from bad
losers).
Starting on December 12 (Sunday) is our
F o r e i g n S t u d e n t s W e e k . T h i s is a v e r y
important week for us and we really need
people to come along on all the evenings and
give the foreign students a good time. We have
the reputation of having the best F S Week in
Europe, so let's make sure we all live up to
that. A s k Mike Naylor (FSO) if he needs any
help or for any details.
N B : We need your names for the Mines Ball
(Dec 17). C o m e in to the office with a cheque
and book your place. We also need the names
of partners of people who haven't told us, and
we need them now!

It has just been brought to our notice that
there are other societies at Imperial College
other than S T O I C that is. We found this newz
somewhat surprising as, apart from the odd
fight with the F E L I X What's O n Editor, we
never hear from them.
Contrary to popular belief Newzbreak does
have an audience (we know this as they keep
phoning us up when we disconnect their sets)
and iz therefore a useful means of publicity for
eventz which are open to all IC students.
Although some of you may never have
experienced it, S T O I C can produce extremely
professional vizual material, and although our
Quantel unit iz at present on loan to Channel
Four, our prezenters are always ready to
provide one of our constitutional functions
which is to publicise union (and society) eventz
and we have an almost endless stock of zs.
Remember, societies, we don't all scour the
F E L I X What's O n page searching you out, so
contact us at the T V Studio or on internal
2637.
Our Hon Sec says "Look what we did for
Guilds Motor Club," anyway, we're sorry and
1
we won't let it happen again,

J Soc
All the recent events seem to indicate that IC J
Soc is becoming more broad-minded. Shock!
H o r r o r ! Is that w h y the c h a i r m a n has
resigned? Was the Friday meal at the Liberal
Synagogue the turning point—no one wanted
to go to the orthodox equivalent? A n d the trip
to the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue—it
attracted all sorts of peoplle. What will this
Friday's controversial, provocative yet truthful
account of events in Lebanon do for this
image? Will the speaker give a second lecture?
W i l l a n y o n e be elected c h a i r m a n , at the
Chanukah Party? Is this the end of J Soc
civilisation as we know it? For the answers t o
t h e s e q u e s t i o n s a n d m o r e , s e n d a self-
addressed envelope and two latkes t o acting
c h a i r p e r s o n s , c/o S C l e t t e r - r a c k s , U n i o n
Office, or come along t o any event listed in
What's O n (eg today 5:45pm).
MOPSOC
This week's lecture is entitled 'Success runs,
M a r k e r c h a i n s a n d s t r e n g t h s of f i b r o u s
materials' in short 'Statistical theories of
strength'. It will be delivered by Dr Richard
Smith of the Physics Department on Tuesday
at 1:00pm in Physics Lecture Theatre 2. So if

I must m e n t i o n Wizards, w h i c h will be
available for viewing this coming Tuesday,
December 7, and is thoroughly recommended.
I mean, after Wuthering Heights what more

Amnesty
Y o u mav well wonder what we do during
our meetings. A t a typical meeting we might
discuss the following: the latest fund-raising
e v e n t (we have to pay a n a n n u a l £400
subscription fee to A l to help towards the
costs of researching prisoner cases), a planned
visit to the Benin Embassy in Paris (going
ahead this December) and letter-writing. So
far this term we have sent over 125 letters to
government officials in B e n i n (where our
prison..: is being held) and over 30 letters as
part of the Urgent Actions scheme.
