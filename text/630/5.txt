Southside Move
Once again College Secretary
J o h n S m i t h a n d the Estates
Department are trying to get the
U n i o n moved to Southside. The
plan, if it goes through, will
i n v o l v e m o v i n g most of the
U n i o n f a c i l i t i e s to the l o w e r
floors of the Southside Building
(below the Halls of Residence)
while allowing College to take
over the present building in Beit
for their own purposes. College
are p r e p a r e d to p a y f o r the
move. W h y are they being so
generous? M o r e i m p o r t a n t l y ,
why are they trying to rush it
t h r o u g h so q u i c k l y ? I n m y
Editorial in one of the postgrad
F E L I C E S I made some observa-
tions as follows:
" W h e n the idea of moving the
U n i o n to Southside was first
m o o t e d , c a u t i o u s o p t i m i s m
seemed to be in order. Premises
in Southside are underused, and
it is in everyone's advantage to
have the U n i o n situated as near
to the main Halls of Residence
as p o s s i b l e . P l a n s h a d b e e n
drawn up after long consulta-
tions with a responsible U n i o n
President, and despite protests
from certain factions who hold a
strong sense of tradition (notably
my two predecessors) it seemed
that the U n i o n could well benefit
from such a scheme.
B u t C o l l e g e ' s a t t i t u d e is
changing. Right from the start
J o h n Smith has been holding his
cards close to his chest. The
move was proposed last M a r c h ,
but the plans were not revealed
to the student body until the
very end of M a y , shortly before
the end of term and certainly not
allowing enough time for suffi-
cient debate on the matter before
undergraduates went home for
t h e l o n g v a c . It w a s t h e n
revealed that for the move to
take place in September 1983,
the U n i o n would have had to
approve the plans by the end of
October 1982, only a few weeks
after u n d e r g r a d u a t e s h a d re-
assembled. Caution began to
harden into suspicion.
N o w the suspicion is turning
to distrust. College is trying a
d i f f e r e n t t a c k . P l a n s f o r the
move have been shelved for the
time being while College offers
more facilities in Southside; very
generous, but we should still be
wary of their motives. In a year
or so, if M r Smith points out to a
different Exec that since we have
so many U n i o n activities based
in Southside it might benefit us
to move the whole U n i o n there,
it will be as well to remember the
methods that were tried the first
time, and to examine the options
very carefully."
The hard sell didn't work, so
College switched to a less heavy- !
handed approach. N o w , with a
new Exec mostly inexperienced
in dealing with College, J o h n
S m i t h has s w i t c h e d b a c k to
trying to push the deal through
as quickly as possible—just as
Mark Smith warned that he would
in his Editorial last May. The
c o r r e c t a t t i t u d e n o w , as i n
August, as last M a y is to be very,
very, careful before we commit
ourselves, and then to get the
d e t a i l s o f ' a n y d e a l w e l l -
publicised and in writing.
Christmas F E L I C E S
I warned you last week that
there will be no F E L I X next
Friday December 10; instead
F E L I X has got together with the
Careers Service to produce a
careers brochure containing lots
of articles for those of you who
are thinking about what you're
going to be doing for eight hours
a day for the rest of your life. It
will be printed with the old red
F E L I X design (like last year's
F E L I C E S ) and there won't be
enough for everyone to have
one, so please don't take one if
you're a first year or a second
year who is less than keen on
m a k i n g a d e c i s i o n a b o u t a
career. It's essential reading for
third years, of course.
The following Tuesday is the
bumper Christmas F E L I X , the
like of which has never been seen
before. This issue coincides with
the r e t i r e m e n t o f C a p t a i n
Lindley, the salty old sea-dog
turned College Administrator
who was so viciously pilloried by
my predecessors.
He rose to fame two years ago
with his repeated insistance that
College is being run at the zenith
of efficiency, and this somewhat
exaggerated view together with
his catchphrase T don't stand
and count 'em' made him almost
too vulnerable to a student rag

such as this. I've let him off
lightly this term, but next week
the Christmas F E L I X will be a
special Captain Lindley retire-
ment issue, with much naval and
ex-naval humour.
In a d d i t i o n , P i n o c c h i o is

kidding) is writing on the lighter

i n t r o d u c e the C h r i s t m a s free
gift, a regular tradition until two
years ago. Yes, the team who
brought you the cut-out model
of the A l b e r t M e m o r i a l , the
contraceptive smartie (hold it
between your knees) and your
very own F E L I X hack (a cough
sweet in every issue) have done it
again. W a i t till next week and
see the biggest and best free gift
ever. A l l this and more in your
C h r i s t m a s F E L I X , p u b l i s h e d
Tuesday week.
Clubs and Societies
A letter from Chess C l u b in
rather injured tone complains
that I refused to print a boring
article they submitted two weeks
a g o ; m a y I o f f e r m y o w n
defence, r a t h e r t h a n use the
pitiful excuses they put into my
m o u t h i n t h e i r letter ( b e f o r e
demolishing them, of course).
Y o u were warned at the end of
last term (in my statement of
intent) and in the Freshers' issue
that this year's policy would be
to cut right back on clubs and
s o c i e t i e s a r t i c l e s . I a s k e d i f
anyone objected to this, and
received no complaints.
We do print some R C C and
S C C articles, and I'm sorry if the
C h e s s C l u b c o n s i d e r t h e m
' m e a n i n g l e s s d r i v e l ' : n e v e r -
theless it's not their job to decide
what is drivel and what isn't: it's
mine. A n d I base my decision,
not only on my own opinion, but
on feedback from other students.
Last year the consensus was that
most clubs and societies articles
(with few exceptions, notably Sci
Fi) were boring; this year, then,
they get axed.
But there is another, yet more
important reason, and this is
why A C C get three pages and
R C C , S C C , the Bookshop and
the C C U s share one page: space
is F E L I X is only limited by the
manpower available, and it is
part.of the A C C V i c e - C h a i r m a n ' s

editor via their interest in sport,
not journalism; if anyone from
R C C or S C C is prepared to take
responsiblity for a page or two
of F E L I X , I'll be more than
delighted to let them fill it with
all the clubs and societies articles
they want. I mean this quite
seriously: any takers?
Other Inclusions
N o society, religious or otherwise,
has a God-given right to articles
in F E L I X . A l l letters, small ads,
f e a t u r e s a n d o p i n i o n s a r e
included at my discretion, and I
t e n d to be less discreet w i t h
anything anonymous or pseud-
onymous.
W h e n it comes to O p i n i o n
policy is to allow anyone the
right to one article, and then any
opposing faction the right of
reply. I cannot then allow the
first writer to reply to the reply
or proliferation and boredom
become the order of the day. If
you write an o p i n i o n , I'm afraid
you'll have to accept that your
o p p o n e n t s w i l l have the last
word. I won't let the opinion
columns become a literary table-
t e n n i s m a t c h ; i f y o u ' r e n o t
happy with the state of affairs
after two articles, write to the
letters page.
Christmas F E L I X Copy Deadline
is 1730h on M o n d a y 6th.
