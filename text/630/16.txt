I thought that salads were for dieters and
rabbits until I discovered the chefs salad at
£3.25. C o n t a i n i n g every salad ingredient
imaginable it probably gives more calories than
some of the puddings. A n d speaking of which,
prices for puddings range from 75p to £1.55.
Pro'i; 'oles smothered with fresh cream for £1
and i M , na split for £1.55 are well worth
sampling.
Cafe Incognito is rarely c r o w d e d and
provides a venue as conclusive to an intimate
evening out for two as it is suitable for a pre
pub-crawl nosh up.
For a three course meal, you can expect to
pay about £5 a head, excluding wine.

Down Exhibition Road, first turning on the
right after Cromwell Road brings you to one of
the best, r e a s o n a b l y p r i c e d r e s t a u r a n t s
around. As the name suggests there is a
French flavour about the place, but beyond
the green louvres, the flavour is diluted,
emphatically not something that can be said
about the food.
F a n c y starters like stuffed m u s h r o o m s
abound; a cheaper but wholly satisfactory
alternative is the slightly herby garlic bread at
45p a go.
If you like burgers, their burgers range from
£2.10 to £3.00 with chips or salad, but since
e v e r y o n e does b u r g e r s , why not try a
gargantuan plate of barbecue spare ribs for
£2.95 or honey fried chicken at the same price?
A very reasonable chilli con came is also on
the menu.
PINCCCHI
Superkings - 1
I came across Tim and Mary in the maths
common room the other day, playing chess.
Knowing each others moves backwards, they
were becoming a little bored with the standard
game, and so decided to change it, by giving
the king new powers; it could now move like
both a queen and a knight (for those of you not
knowing the game, these moves are shown in
the diagram). Soon an argument developed as
to how many of these superkings one could
place on a chess board, without any being able
to take another. Having solved this problem,
they then attempted to place these superkings
so that no three are collinear (this includes
lines other than rows, columns or diagonals).
A s an example, the third diagram shows the
only way to put 4 superkings on a 5x5 board.
Can you help them answer this question;
how many non-collinear superkings can you
put on a c h e s s b o a r d (please give an
example)?

MendaBike for a randomly selected entry.
This week's puzzle is a little easy, but is
merely a 'taster' for one of the Christmas
puzzles, which will be much more difficult. Also
could the person who sent me the 'Rope from
. the Belfry' puzzle please send me his name
and/or pseudonym. Has anyone else ideas for
puzzles for Christmas?
