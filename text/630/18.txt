I C U Notes:
1. There are more than 800 student unions affiliated to the N a t i o n a l U n i o n
of Students, a n d more than l m student members o f N U S .
2. T h e N U S c a m p a i g n s o n g r a n t s , student l o a n s , h o u s i n g , p a r e n t a l
contributions and many other matters w h i c h all p r o f o u n d l y affect Imperial
College Students.
3. I m p e r i a l College U n i o n is not affiliated to N U S , has n o say in N U S
policies a n d receives benefits from N U S without contributions.
I C U Believes:
1. In the face of the present cutbacks in higher education there has never
been a greater need for student unity.
2. T h e only practical way to change N U S is by becoming part of it and
m a k i n g o u r voices heard.
3. T h a t five years after its dissaffiliation from N U S , it is time for Imperial
College U n i o n to think again. It is time for a full a n d democratic debate on
arguments for and against N U S membership i n v o l v i n g all members of I C U .
I C U Instructs:
1. T h e U n i o n Executive to make preparations for the required referendum
on N U S membership w h i c h s h o u l d be held next College term.
