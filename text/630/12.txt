IC vs Q M C 1 6-3
IC Ists recent revival continued
on Saturday in this high-scoring,
low skill, low temperature, low
visibility 6-3 win over Q M C .
Despite the absence of J o h n L a y
(groin strain), A l a n H a r l o w and
Steve D u n h i l l (both trying to get
groin strains!) I C quickly took
control and were soon 2-0 up
t h r o u g h w e l l - t a k e n g o a l s by
N i c k G a s k i l l a n d G r a h a m
Rickard. H o w e v e r , Q M C r e c e i v e d
an early Christmas present when
a series of passes to the opposi-
t i o n by G r i f f i t h s a n d B e r n s
('Who's side was he o n , any-
w a y ? ' ) c u l m i n a t e d i n M a r t i n
Curran's clearance rebounding
off a Q M C player into the net.
Soon after the start of the
second half Dave Stephenson
made it 3-1 but IC's defence,
apparently thinking the game
wasn't close enough, gave Q M C
a n o t h e r g o a l . T h e f o l l o w i n g
p e r i o d o f I C p r e s s u r e w a s
notable for that rare species, a
R i c k a r d header. G r a h a m , a m a z e d
to see the keeper save at full
stretch. Soon after this Dave
Griffiths beat the off-side trap
and headed home G r a h a m ' s free
kick. Being two goals up I C
again lost interest a n d keeper
Steve Veats bought an expensive
d u m m y as Q M C made it 4-3. In
t h e g a t h e r i n g g l o o m D a v e
Stephenson got his second goal
of the game, and then finally the
ball loomed out of the fog to hit
Kev 'almost-goal-a-game' Reeve
on the knee a n d finish up in
Q M C ' s net.
IC vs Kings 3-1
The 3-1 victory over Kings (4)
was a g a m e d r a g g e d o u t o f
mediocrity by the efforts of one
man.
A d e v a s t a t i n g d r i b b l e , i n
which J o h n M c G u c k i n beat 11

sending the ball fifty yards into a
stiff w i n d for Dave Stee to score.
A n y Kings attacks were repelled
by razor-sharp tackling tireless
running from M c G u c k i n . H T 1-
0; in the line of duty, Megastar
M c G u c k i n offers his orange to
captain Page, saying ' Y o u need
it more than I do!"
K i n g s d r e w level after the
b r e a k , d e s p i t e a n i n c r e d i b l e
effort from M c G u c k i n to keep
the ball out. This setback raised
M c G u c k i n ' s anger, and his pace,
vision and cunning were too
m u c h for K i n g s . T h e i r g o a l -
keeper was so intent on avoiding
kicking the ball anywhere near
M c G u c k i n , he kicked it straight
to R i c k a r d . w h o scored.
A final goal, resulting from
M c G u c k i n d r a w i n g no fewer
than six Kings defenders out of
the box, was a mere formality, so
demoralised were Kings by this
fine citizen.
Thirds
IC vs Q E C 1 2-2
H a v i n g trekked the wild outback
on foot from R i c h m o n d tube, I C
I l l ' s m i r a c u l o u s l y a r r i v e d
complete with eleven men at the
remote Petersham sports ground
to t a k e o n t h e m i g h t o f a
Queen's first eleven w h o had
demolished a depleted I C IV's 6-
1 only ten days previously.
F o l l o w i n g a hesitant start on a
rain-soaked pitch which didn't
allow either side to dominate, I C
allowed Queens the luxury of an
unmarked header from a flicked-
on corner and paid the inevitable
price.
A n e n t h u s i a s t i c f i g h t b a c k
e n s u e d w i t h c e n t r e f o r w a r d
A n t o n Milner battling gamely
against a tight central defence.
The breakthrough finally came
through a powerful drive from
new signing Bill M c G i n n which
left the keeper grasping for thin
air. Happiness was short-lived
however as a simple defensive
error was punished in clinical
f a s h i o n , a n d Q E C went i n t o
the interval leading by the odd
goal in three.
A n exciting if slightly scrappy
second half saw several chances
go begging at either end. M i d f i e l d
a c e N e i l V a n d e n b e g i n w a s
u n l u c k y to see his s p a r k l i n g
cross-field r u n create nothing
b u t a f r u i t l e s s g o a l - m o u t h
scramble, a n d stand in captain
Chris G o r d o n missed a good
opportunity from close range in
classic defenders' style.
The climax of the match came
fifteen minutes from the end as
Bill set the seal on his debut with
another stunning goal from the
edge of the box to gain I C a well-
earned draw. A good result from
an u n d e r - s t r e n g t h team that
definitely needs to improve its
performance at darts!

Ten Pin Bowling
Six intrepid adventurers set oil'
for the snowy wastes of Suichlcv

After arriving in Birmingham
at 9 : 3 0 p m . R a y ' s s i e v e -1 i k e

guide us to the required bus stop
and we arrived with plenty of
time to spare so the local chippy
was invaded and Jeff and M a r k
proceeded to show these B r u m -
mies how to play video games,
before returning to the bowl to
register.
A t m i d n i g h t p r e c i s e l y t h e
bowling began.
For the first few hours the
team bowled well, staying as
high as fifth place for some time
but at around 7:00pm we started
to tire. R a y , w h o had previously
proved himself extremely adept
at s k i m m i n g the ball under the
gate with just a few inches to
spare, actually started to wait
until the pins had put i n an
appearance before starting his
run up, and as the teams scores
fell a w a y t h e d r e a d e d s u b -
h u n d r e d l o o k e d i n c r e a s i n g l y
likely. After a number of close
shaves it finally happened at
about 10:30, a n d the whole team
was smothered i n sympathy for
his embarrassment.
B y t h i s t i m e , A n d y w a s
s t o r m i n g u p the i n d i v i d u a l

competition at mid-day he had
reached third place overall, out
of 120 entrants. Paul excelled

average to finish approximately
25th, a n d K e v i n , Jeff (who also
bowled above average), R a y a n d

between 40th and 60th, the team
overall finishing 8th out of 20th.

Rifle & Pistol
It's been a bad week for I C ' s
top marksperson T Huggs w h o
flopped to a miserable 89 i n the
L S B R A league, thus wrecking
totally the chances of I C A team,
unless G a r y a n d G o r d o n , (Pro-
fessor) Bowser can produce the
sort of form that has pulled us
from the jaws of ignominy on
many occasions before.

John Warton in reaching the
week's lowest score of 77(!).

experience at first h a n d the
astute w i t o f Steve H a r r i s o n

the ritual devastating homily to
the nation from the top table at
the c l u b d i n n e r . A l l meet i n

any female markspersons pre-
sent, watch out for Noel L i n d -
say, especially if he is carrying a
sleeping bag.

Finally, on M o n d a y evening,

there's a mini-social going on in
