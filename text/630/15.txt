starring William Hurt a n d Blair

Russell.
-In recent years, Altered States
of consciousness have been
recognised and their reality
probed. Among the most
provocative experiments is

salt water, and floating in
total isolation. With each new
experiment and discovery
comes a mounting awareness
of the wonder yet to be found
within ourselves.
