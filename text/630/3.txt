The Royal College of Science
Union's mascotry team is making
arrangements for the return of
two of the mascots that they have
violated over the past year. The
School of Slavonic and East
European Studies (SSEES) has
accepted RCSU's terms, but no
reply has yet been received from
Queen Mary College.
S S E E S students have agreed
to buy fifty Rag Mags and to go
carol singing in Russell Square
later this month; all proceeds
will go to R C S Rag funds. It is
generally believed that they have
been let off lightly because of the
small size of this predominantly
female college. Their mascot,
Velish, is a stuffed Aberdeen
Angus bull's head and was taken
f r o m its resting place i n the
c a n t e e n e a r l i e r t h i s m o n t h .
According to a spokesman from
S S E E S , it is meant to represent
the ( n o w e x t i n c t ) B u l g a r i a n
Bison, which is an East European
fertility symbol—but this claim
should probably not be taken
too seriously.
The Q M C mascot, a stuffed
leopard called M a r y , was cap-
tured by the R C S last M a r c h ,
and negotiations for her return
are still in the opening stages. A
first demand of fifty pints of
blood and fifty donations to the
sperm bank, with 'the proceeds
to go to the R C S U ' has been
m a d e , w i t h r e c e i p t s to be
delivered by January 24. N o
reply has been received yet.
Dried Up
R e s i d e n t s o f the F r e m a n t l e
Hotel were without water last
Thursday because of a broken
water main in the Earl's Court
R o a d . T h e s u p p l y h a d been
severed the previous Tuesday
but the large capacity water tank
at the Fremantle provides water
for two days, and the supply was
reconnected on Friday.
Brave New
World?
B r i t a i n is e n t e r i n g an era of
unparalleled wealth and pros-
perity, the Right Honourable
Kenneth Baker told the Indus-
t r i a l S o c i e t y o n T h u r s d a y .
Today's students will probably
u n d e r g o s e v e r a l c h a n g e s o f
career as a result of the new
micro-chip revolution, he said.
M r Baker was made the first
ever Minister for Information
Technology in 1980, with res-
ponsibility for the electronics,
telecommunications and space
industries—the only industries.
FoPSoc
Thwarted
A letter was sent this week by
Union President Stephen Goulder
to the 'Friends of Palestine'
organisation, discouraging its
members from displaying publi-
city around College.
M r Goulder said that F O P
was not one of the U n i o n ' s
constitutional social clubs, since
it has not undergone the two
required readings from major
committees.
F O P h a d been d i s p l a y i n g
strongly political posters in the
U n i o n and the Halls of Residence
without seeking approval from
either the Honorary Secretary or
the W a r d e n . T h i s l e d to a
complaint being forwarded to
the U n i o n Executive. The source
o f t h i s c o m p l a i n t was n o t
revealed.
In his l e t t e r , M r G o u l d e r
p o i n t e d out that F O P m a y

society within I C U by consti-
tutional procedures, but they
would still have to abide by
U n i o n Publicity Rules and any
posters deemed offensive would
not be allowed on U n i o n pre-
mises.
he claimed, that will not decline
over the next twenty years. In
particular he will be supervising
the e s t a b l i s h m e n t o f c a b l e
television in 1986, which will be
used not only for entertainment,
but for information and home
banking services, and even, he
suggested, for burglar alarms
He also outlined the reasons
for ending the British Telecom
monopoly, claiming that such a
rapidly developing field could
only be propelled by compe-
tition. If Conservative legislation
is p a s s e d he b e l i e v e s t h a t
Telecom will be privatised in the
near future.
Howell of
Boredom
The Government's new Trans-
port Bill will allow for reason-
able but not unlimited subsidies
for public transport, including
L o n d o n Transport, the Secretary
of State for Transport D a v i d
Howell said in a speech to IC
Conservative Society on Tues-
day. This was to ensure a stable
and consistent level of subsidy
with proper balance between the
interests of local ratepayers and
paying passengers.
M r Howell stated the necessity
to a v o i d h i g h f a r e s w h i c h
discouraged people from travel-
ling and high costs to ratepayers
particularly businesses, which
r e s u l t i n c l o s u r e s a n d j o b
losses. He stressed the need for a
proper balance between these
factors combined with long-term
p l a n n i n g of t r a n s p o r t p o l i c y .
W i t h o u t this he c l a i m e d the
subsidies bill for metropolitan
t r a n s p o r t a u t h o r i t i e s w o u l d
escalate to £700m next year from
£300m this year.
He disclosed his sympathy for
the view that control of L o n d o n
Transport should be removed
from the G L C and passed to a
separate Transport Authority, a.>
suggested by a House of C o m -
mons Select Committee. H e also
spoke of the need for an i m -
provement in London's roads.
M r Howell arrived twenty-five
minutes late for the meeting,
b l a m i n g traffic c o n g e s t i o n in
L o n d o n f o r h i s d e l a y a n d
addressed an audience of about
sixty. S p e a k i n g a b o u t recent
l e g i s l a t i o n a l l o w i n g i n c r e a s e d
lorry weights, he stated that road
transport had developed for the
last twenty years without new
legislation. The new regulations
would reduce lorry damage to
roads despite increased weights
by requiring an extra axle on
heavy lorries, as well as new
limits on length, height, noise
a n d e m i s s i o n s , a l o n g w i t h
compulsory under-run guards
and improved brakes. H e also
s t a t e d t h a t the m o s t r o a d
damage was caused by 16 ton 2
axle lorries, and that the new
weight limits would allow lorries
to be filled rather than running
up to a third empty, resulting in
fewer lorries on the roads.
LSE Out?
Students at the L o n d o n School
of E c o n o m i c s came close to
refusing to pay their £12,000
affiliation fee to the National
U n i o n of Students last week. A t
Monday's routine union meeting,
a m o t i o n p r o p o s i n g that the
money should be spent on a
racehorse attracted a majority of
the votes.
But the L S E w i l l r e m a i n
affiliated to the N U S because a
two-thirds majority is required
on all financial matters. It also
seems likely that the motion was
o u t s i d e the p o w e r s o f the
constitution because the students'
union is (for tax purposes) a
registered charity.
Sirs' Pleas
Bill Sirs, General Secretary of
the I r o n a n d S t e e l T r a d e s
Confederation, called for the
initiation of import controls to
protect home industries, when
he s p o k e to the I n d u s t r i a l
Society on Tuesday.
M o s t of M r S i r s ' s address
concerned his job as a Trade
U n i o n l e a d e r , b u t n o t u n -
expectedly he took time off to
criticise the Conservative G o v -
ernment's industrial policy. H e
also gave an insight into the day-
to-day running of the Labour
Party; M r Sirs was instrumental
in the switch to a more moderate
executive earlier this year.
