Human Rights Week
During the next seven days, a whole range of clubs and societies will be
getting together with the aim of making members of the College more
aware of violations of human rights in the world. The result is Human
Rights Week, being held under the auspices of the Social Clubs
Committee.
Throughout the next week there will be speakers and films on various
aspects of human rights. On Thursday there is a Human Rights Fair in
the J C R at which clubs will be represented by displays and stalls.
Further details are given later.
It is a l l too easy to accuse governments which are of a different
political or religious persuasion of human rights violations while
ignoring those carried out by one's o w n . The United K i n g d o m
government has been found guilty by the European Commission of
H u m a n Rights, in recent years, of torturing prisoners in its gaols,
restricting press freedom, restricting people's right not to join a trade
union and having subjected criminals to degrading punishment.
Citizens of this country, however, do have some form of remedy
against their government. People in some countries are not so
fortunate.
H u m a n Rights Week is a way of informing y o u of their plight. A t
the very least the Week will remind those who live in free countries,
like the U K , h o w lucky they are a n d of the need for constant
vigilance to defend their cherished freedoms.

'produces about 4,000 volts but
with very low current to avoid
burns or permanent injury' and
would almost certainly be used
for torturing.

A s I wrote last week, the best

wins a large Christmas pudding,
so get thinking. (Grossly Over-
weight U n i o n Leader....)
S O M A N Y doctors' reception-
ists t a k e p r i d e i n b e i n g as
obstructively officious as possi-
ble; such a relief then, to find
that those at the College Health
C e n t r e are about as h e l p f u l ,
charming and efficient as it is
possible to be. Still, even H o m e r
nods, as they say, and I was
amused to hear a story about
someone w h o phoned up the
Health Centre to ask if it would
be possible to book an appoint-
ment w i t h D r T o n y H a i n e s .
Since T o n y had recently left to
take up his new j o b , the recep-
tionist replied that she was sorry
but ' D r Haines is no longer with
us.'
There was a slightly embar-
rassed pause before the caller
replied ' O h dear, I am sorry...1
had no idea' a n d then hung up,
clearly under the impression that

T o n y had been called to much
higher service.
A N O T H E R C O U P L E o f stories
from the Health Centre, this
tim e f r o m a s p l e n d i d freebie
given by the staff to introduce us
U n i o n h a c k s l o t h e H e a l t h
Centre people, a n d in particular
to A l a n Swann, the new doctor.
Stephen G o u l d e r was there, o f
c o u r s e , h a v i n g c o m e f r o m
several other receptions during
the day, a drink in the bar at
lunchtime and the U n i o n sherry
hour at six o'clock; consequently
he was more than a little the
worse for alcohol, and when he
came to introduce the Deputy
P r e i s d e n t a n d the H o n o r a r y
Secretary of the U n i o n , he forgot
not one but both of their names.
But for me the most ironic
incident o f the evening was the
absence of D r Swann himself,
who had left work at lunchtime
that day. Reason? H e wasn't
feeling well!
O N E D A Y I really must meet
Gareth Fish and find out just
why (or how) he keeps getting
involved in such curious predica-
ments. T h i s week's escapade

c o n c e r n s t w o p h o t o g r a p h s I
have been given of said M r Fish
without clothing i n the U n i o n
Bar. In one o f them he is being
forcibly held down in a spread-
eagle posture for heaven knows
what purpose, a n d in the other
he is locked in an embrace with
the R a g Mag's pneumatic a d -
vertising manager, Leah Phelps.

decency.
I D O N ' T K N O W what some
people expect of a newspaper.
M i k e M a c C l a n c y , subject o f
several anecdotes in this column
last week, came to see me last
Friday full of merriment and
laughter. W h y , he wanted to
know, had I missed out some of
his grossest cock-ups? H e went
on to detail several more stories
against h i m s e l f , a l l o f w h i c h
caused much hilarity among the
F E L I X staff.
It was a very different M r
M a c C l a n c y w h o came to see me
later in the week, quite outraged
that I was actually considering
printing more stories about h i m .
Still, I've spelt his name right
this week, so he hasn't got quite
so much to grumble at.
