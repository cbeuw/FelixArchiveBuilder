Symes scores hattrick in IC
points landslide!
J o h n Symes, ace fullback with
the IC 2nd X V allstars shambled
over the tryline three times as
Goldsmiths were crushed 34-0
by a strong I C team. R u m o u r s
t h a t t h e p e r f o r m a n c e w a s
inspired by the wearing of wet,
smelly R C S shirts were vigorous-
ly denied, though many players
on the Goldsmiths side reckoned
it was due to the mysterious
'sixteenth player' wearing a red
s h i r t . T h i s a p p a r i t i o n , t h e y
claim, was seen to be tackling
players round the neck, joining
rucks on the wrong side, spoiling
p o s s e s s i o n a n d , w o r s t of a l l ,
b l o w i n g his w h i s t l e s t o p p i n g
play at vital moments. Totally
demolished by this, they concen-
trated on verbal assaults on the
aforementioned player, while the
I C team got on with and winning
the game. Tries from N o d d y ,
M i c k e y , H o w a r d and A N Other
(whose name I didn't get because
my pencil broke) left Goldsmiths
reeling.
W i l l they use this ploy again?
M i c k W i n s o r was not sober
enough for comment, but shouts
of ' N o t a f — i n g chance, J o h n '
f r o m the r e f e r e e ' s c h a n g i n g
room would seem to suggest
(cont. p 94).
Cycling
Seven cyclists set out from Beit
A r c h at 9 : 3 0 a m to C l a p h a m
J u n c t i o n w h e r e we met I a n
Lacey. We caught a train to
E p s o m to avoid the worst of
L o n d o n ' s t r a f f i c , p o t h o l e s ,
b r o k e n glass a n d r e d t r a f f i c
lights. The guard told us to put
our bikes in a carriage as there
w a s n ' t e n o u g h r o o m i n the
luggage compartment for himself
and the bikes.
We rode to C o b h a m and then
followed a windy lane. After a
while R o n a n wanted to look at
the map while still riding his
fixed-wheel track bike. Little did
he k n o w t h a t we w e r e j u s t
a p p r o a c h i n g a s h o r t , s t e e p ,
muddy, winding descent. The
m a p s t i l l s h o w s teeth m a r k s
where he held the map.
Further on we crossed a ford
in Shere by the footbridge—
except R o n a n , who rode through
the ford. We stopped in G o m -
T w o m i l e s f u r t h e r o n we
t u r n e d off the m a i n r o a d to
climb White Downs. The gentle
protests of the slight gradient
suddenly changed, after taking
the hairpin, to a series of gasps
and groans as they could see the
second half of the hill. This was
the only hill of the day. We went
over R a n m o r e C o m m o n a n d
found our way back to E p s o m
through some very narrow lanes.
O n our way back from C l a p -
ham R o n a n continued to enter-
tain us by balancing on his bike
at red traffic lights. A s a finale at
the junction opposite the M a t h s
Department, he fell off.
IC's play.
The main problem was, as
u s u a l , a l a c k o f t e a m c o -
ordination. But is this surprising
w h e n n o - o n e l i s t e n s to the
coaching?

I C vs Q M C 5-4
O w i n g to their imminent late
arrival I C changed on the coach,
leaving the shorts until arrival
due to their unwillingness to
reveal their naughty bits to the
viewing public. A r r i v i n g at the
ground with seconds to spare I C
donned the shorts and set off in
search of a pitch. The match,
shortened to thirty minutes a
half, finally got underway. I C
son fell one behind, but N i c k
L o w t o n e q u a l i s e d f r o m the
penalty spot. A t half-time I C
were 2-1 up due to another goal
by N i c k , who had finally realised
that to score a goal he had to put
the little white ball between the
large white posts.
W i t h f i v e m i n u t e s o f the

IC vs Avery Hill 51-62
The season hasn't started well,
but after a good performance
against St M a r y s last week we
w e r e l o o k i n g f o r w a r d to a
victory against a weak Avery
H i l l squad.
O b s e r v i n g the teams w h i l e
warming-up, I C looked by far
the better of the two, but we still
lost! N O excuse can be made this
time, it was an absolute sham-
bles. It i s n ' t p o s s i b l e to say
FELIXI
Nine members of the ciub made
the t r i p to R e a d i n g f o r the
Whitenights's Relays with the
first objective of f i n d i n g the
course. We eventually arrived
after a scenic tour of Reading
and began the serious business
of picking teams.
Picking the ladies team was
easy, we didn't have any ladies,
but H u g h D i x o n managed to
organise three spare ladies to run
for I C . The club had entered
t h r e e m e n s t e a m s so it was
decided that three men would
have to run twice to make up the
f o u r m e n t e a m s , the l u c k y
v o l u n t e e r s were s u i t a b l y r e -
named for their second legs.
So to the race, Tasso Aster-
iades ran a fast first leg for the A
team, handing over to H u g h
D i x o n i n a b o u t 1 3 t h . H u g h
handed over to A n d r e w Griffiths
who ran well with the team now
a b o u t t e n t h . R o b M o r r i s o n ,
after several wrong turns due to
the fog, brought the A team in.
The B team was led off by
G r a h a m H a r k e r who handed
over to Steve T a y l o r who then
passed on to J o n L e a . J o n ,
r u n n i n g w e l l c o n s i d e r i n g his
recent injury, handed over to
H u g h D i x o n running his second
leg.
. The C team was led off by .'on
Frost (Capt) who handed on to
Kelvin Acford. Tasso Asteriades
on his second leg took over and
the t e a m was m a d e u o by
A n d r e w G r i f f i t h s w h - r a n
another quick leg.
Wednesday the 24th we went
to Thames Poly for the third
race to see if we could keep it up.
Missing some key runners (they
know who they are) the less
talented athletes had to excel
themselves for us to stand any
c h a n c e o f m a i n t a i n i n g o u r
p o s i t i o n i n the l e a g u e . T h e
course at Thames Poly is classic
cross country: hilly with lots of
s t i c k y , s m e l l y m u d , a n d the
weather was superb: cold and
windy. O n l y the torrential rain
was missing to make this the
perfect day out.
Hugh D i x o n (aka H Bomme)
only managed to come sixth.

from his spikes. M a n d y T i n d a l l

his ankle while running so get

Ladies Rugby
Does I C have any aggressive,
fun-loving, fit or unfit females
who are prepared to have a go
at rugby? N o previous experience
is required, just enthusiasm and
a death wish! This is your chance
to beat the men at their o w n
g a m e . I f i n t e r e s t e d c o n t a c t
Marabella, Selkirk or meet 12:30
Beit Q u a d , Thursday lunchtime.
( M e n need not apply.)
PS: If rugby is a game played
by men with o d d shaped b a l l s —
what do women play with?

IC vs Middlesex 5-0
Dear M u m
Thank you for your last letter.
G l a d to hear that things are fine
at home. Y o u will be pleased to
hear that my ladies hockey team
are doing very well this season
having won five out of seven
league g a m e s . D e s p i t e i n j u r y
problems to some key players
(too much sport was it Karen?)
we've been turning out some
good teams.
In our last game the forwards
really 'got it together' and scored
a few goals (they missed a lot
more) I think they must have
been practising so that I wouldn't
m o a n at them so much.
