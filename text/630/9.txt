Little Cretin
Schweyk in the Second World War by
Bertolt Brecht, music by Hanns Eisler,
directed by Richard Eyre, The Olivier,
National Theatre.
Schweyk, the archetypal 'little man' and
imbecile and moron extraordinaire, was born
of the pen of Jaroslav Hasek in the early years
of this century. In The Good Soldier Schweyk,
the hero achieves the rare distinction of being
taken prisoner by his own side. H e is a
disgrace to his uniform (an ill-fitting one).
Jaroslav Hasek, a Bohemian, seems to bear
an uncanny resemblance to the hero in his
novel. Hasek scribbled stories in the intervals
of wandering off and getting into drunken
brawls. His sole biographer, Sir Cecil Parrott,
relates of his frequent entry into police
records, one of which was to the effect that
"while in an intoxicated state, the above-
named performed his lesser bodily needs in
front of the main police station." A one-time
soldier and a one-time anarchist, he achieved a
modicum of respectability when he edited a
journal called 'Animal World', but spoiled it by
inventing new animals and embellishing it with
hitherto unknown facts such as that elephants
enjoy gramophone records.
Brecht considerably reworked the novel into
the musical play we have today. The Brechtian
Schweyk is once again an accomplished cretin
who tells jokes and ludicrous anecdotes with
an incessant zeal. Bill Paterson takes on the
(demanding) title role in the production at the
National Theatre, and what a hilarious evening
it turns out to be!
Schweyk's cretinism is gloriously demon-
strated right from the start of the play. A
Gestapo agent brings in news of attempt on
A d o l f ' s life in M u n i c h . S c h w e y k wonders
whether this is the Adolf who worked for the
chemists and is now in the concentration
camp, or the Adolf who collected dog manure
and is now in the concentration camp.
But there is more to Schweyk than his
imbecility. Schweyk does not resist. He does
not rebel. He does not argue. He does not
question. He does not demand. He does not
defy. In short, Schweyk possesses all those
splendidly negative attributes that authority
looks for in the perfect, passive c i t i z e n .
Authority can always depend on Schweyk. But
don't think Schweyk and his story is a period
piece. O h no, Schweykism lives and there are
S c h w e y k s e v e r y w h e r e , yes e v e n in t h i s
College. Even the person sitting next to you as
you read this may be a S c h w e y k . ( Y o u r
reviewer knows of at least two Schweyks in
the College.) Most importantly for the play, a
Schweyk knows the secret of immortality
itself: yield. The first rule of Schweykism is
conquer by yielding. Shall not the meek inherit
the earth?
In Schweyk in the Second World War we
a r e s e e i n g h o w t h e w o r l d ' s S c h w e y k s
contributed to Hitler's global campaigns, albeit
in a hilarious manner. The play is interluded
with views of the 'higher regions' where Hitler
and his accomplices look down on the world
and d e m a n d reassurance that they may
depend on 'the little man', and it is here that we
witness a stroke of genius by the designer of
this production, William Dudley. Hitler and his
grim gang (Himmler, Goering, Goebbels and
V a n Bock) are presented as enormous figures
with strikingly large masks. These appear right
at the beginning of the play in a halo of dry ice
and coloured lights among clouds drawn in the
manner of caricatures of these characters.
Hissing electronic sounds complement their
metallic echoing voices, and one is reminded of
some episode of Dr Who involving the master
of the universe or some such. The production
is full of such bedazzling theatrical effects. O n
returning to the auditorium after the interval
one is confronted with a n enormous b o x over
which is draped a black cloth. At the start of
the second part a huge hand descends upon
this box and lifts off the drapery with forefinger
and thumb in a P y t h o n e s q u e fashion. A
Hogarthian corner of Bedlam is revealed,
replete with cripples, and of course Schweyk.
Besides the settings and the effects, the
characters and the plot are no less amusing.
Brettschneider. Gestapo agent provocateur, is
played by William Armstrong. With a small
moustache, well worn raincoat and grubby
briefcase he looks the picture of a provincial
newspaper journalist seeking some sordid
piece of scandal, M r Armstrong can assume
the most ludicrous and comic facial expres-
ses. Brian Glover plays Baloun, a rotund
gentleman rather partial to dumplings, and
Harry Towb plays the part of SS Lieutenant
Bullinger. A large part of the plot comes
around the trouble Schweyk finds himself
landed in when he is ordered by SS Bullinger
to wrest out of the clutches of its owner a little
dog he (Bullinger) has taken a fancy to in the
park. Bullinger wants to give it to his wife, and
S c h w e y k has to get the dog or face the
consequences.
The production comes a little bit loose at the
seams in the second part when there is much
wandering about the stage and little dialogue
but this doesn't blot the p r o d u c t i o n in a
significant way. The play remains very funny,
totally zany and totally unmissable.

Lyrical Epic
The Night of San Lorenzo, Cert A, written
and directed by Paolo and Vittorio
Taviani, Curzon Cinema, Cur on St.
Subtitled.
It is the night of San Lorenzo, the night of
the falling stars when wishes come true, that a
young woman chooses to recall her loved
one, her baby son, one such night long ago in
1944 when she and a group of peasants iefi
behind their small Tuscan village to escape the
Nazis and seek the protection of their allies,
the Americans. But the child is asleep and the
young woman therefore talks to herself and
the audience.
The peasants wander across their ancestral
landscape managing to avoid the Germans but
failing to avoid the fascists, the blackshirts.
These encounters are brief and bloody, but
throughout the film the peasants' struggle with
the landscape and with the marauding gangs of
fascists is blown up to epic proportions in the
minds of the survivors. The events are as seen
through the eyes of a six-year-old girl, but the
Taviani brothers are clearly seeking to chart
how a human ordeal changes with time in the
minds of individuals, and how it is embellished
a n d h a n d e d d o w n t h r o u g h the e n s u i n g
decades. In short the brothers are seeking the
origins of a legend. The peasants' arduous trek
through the countryside becomes a kind of
Iliad and when, through hunger and tiredness,
they begin to hallucinate, they see Homeric
figures complete with shield, helmet and lance
materialise by their side.
The film paints some shocking contrasts
Not all the villagers left their homes, about half
sought refuge in the church: the church, and
the people inside, are blown up by the
Germans. The sight of the priest, dejected and
surrounded by corpses, and suddenly lonely
as his remaining flock escape the scene of
carnage carrying with them their mutilations
was indeed a pitiful sight. (The T a v i a n
brothers claim the events as fact; the film is
b a s e d o n their c h i l d h o o d e x p e r i e n c e s
Another shocking contrast was a fierce battle
between the wandering peasants and the
blackshirts in a ripe corn field. However, this
scene somewhat failed to convey the drama
i n t e n d 1. Many died in this confrontation but
because the film never built up on character
isation to any significant extent, this episode
was somewhat distant and unmoving. Even the
superb Omero Antonutti, who played a harsh
and almost eccentric father in the brothers'
a c c l a i m e d Padre Padrone, fails to c o m
through as a distinct character.
T h e film ends where it started with a
romantic view of a starlit sky above a quiet
city, seen through the opened windows of a
room. The woman's voice softly concludes the
tale; the legend has now become a romance.
Winner of the Special Jury Prize at this year's
C a n n e s F i l m Festival The Night of San
Lorenzo is lyrical, visionary and epic, and
despite its limitations it remains a very good
film.
