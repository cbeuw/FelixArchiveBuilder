TREACLED MINERS

O f f i c e was b r o k e n i n t o and
s e v e r a l t r o p h i e s s t o l e n l a s t
Thursday. Two miners who were
present in the office have since
been treacled and feathered for
not defending union property.

heavily-masked raiders burst in
and t h r e a t e n e d to b e c o m e
violent if anyone resisted. They
t h e n s t o l e the b l a d e o f the
M o r p h y Oar (the remaining part
is still in the possession of City
and G u i l d s Union) and several
of the shields hanging on the
walls, before spraying the office
with shaving foam and leaving.
R S M U are still mystified as to
who the raiders could have been
for although the letters ' U C
were sprayed several times on
the w a l l s , u n i o n o f f i c e r s at
University College have denied
all knowledge of the raid. This is
not being treated as a mascotry
raid, as neither the M o r p h y Oar
n o r the s h i e l d s is v i o l a t e .

Eagleson and Hobbs were tarred
and feathered (or, more accur-
ately, treacled and feathered) for
not dying in the service of the

GRAVEL MINERS

Money raised from the exploita-
tion of gravel deposits under the
C o l l e g e ' s s p o r t s g r o u n d at
H a r l i n g t o n should be used to
improve existing sports facilities,
according to a submission to the
Finance and Executive Council.
For over two years there have
been plans to extract the gravel,
which is expected to be worth
over a million pounds to College.
Substantial deposits are aire; e /
being mined on adjacent sites,
and the College has received
estimates of the total income and
time scale of the operation; it is
College policy to put all such
work out to tender. The original
plans in 1980 were that the
m o n e y s h o u l d go t o w a r d s
improving student residence, but
it has since been discovered by
U n i o n Officers that the grounds
are held in trust by the G o v e r n -
ing Body and that the intention
of the original agreement was
that all money raised from their
sale s h o u l d be used o n l y to
provide further sporting facilities
for students.

great extent, and asks that a
m i n i m u m area of thirty acres
(plus cricket square and tennis
courts) should be usuable at all

expresses disquiet at the process
of restoring the grounds after-
w a r d s , â€” since it c o u l d cause
considerable harm to the quality
of the cricket square, hockey
pitches and tennis courts.
At the last meeting of the
c o m m i t t e e . C o l l e g e r e p r e -
sentatives agreed to supply the
U n i o n with the results of tests
and the estimates that have been
submitted. U n i o n Officers have
made it clear that they can only
r e a c h a d e c i s i o n on s u c h a
scheme if they are kept fully
informed of any further develop-
ments.
