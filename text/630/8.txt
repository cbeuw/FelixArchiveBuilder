Three weeks ago Friends of Palestine wrote an Opinion article expressing
their point of view on the conflicts in the Middle East. The following week
Jewish Society made reply, and this week it is the turn of a third faction to
express their opinions on the others' views.
In The Name of God
Peace in Palestine
—an Islamic Perspective
Thus we believe that the killing of even
one child is enough to define the recent
Israeli aggression as a 'holocaust'.
As muslims (devoted to G o d ) we have to
work for the achievement of Justice; surely,
we would prefer this to be done peacefully

'harshness' l o the criminals as ordained i n
the L a w :
" W e ordained therein (Torah) for them
Life for life, eye for eye,
Nose for nose, ear for ear
Tooth for tooth, a n d wounds
Equal for equal."

Peace in Palestine and for that matter
anywhere in the world must be based on
Justice.
Everybody knows a n d understands the
hardships inflicted upon the Jews by the
Nazis during W o r l d W a r II. However, it is
not u n d e r s t a n d a b l e w h y this subject is
a l w a y s b r o u g h t u p whenever s o m e b o d y
mentions Zionist crimes. W h y is it that the
Jews want people to condemn the Nazis for
their crimes, but whitewash the crimes of the
Zionist state? This shows a double standard
attitude.
G o d , who created the Heavens, the Earth
and mankind is the most Beneficient. H e
gave us (through H i s Prophets) the L a w to
keep us from going astray, he has (in H i s
Last Revelation) reminded the Jews and the
Christians o f the importance of keeping to
His L a w :
"Say: O People of the Book!
Ye have no ground
T o stand upon unless
Ye stand fast by the L a w ,
The Gospel, a n d all the Revelation
That has come to y o u from
Y o u r L o r d . " ( K o r a n 5-71)
G o d promised to give the H o l y L a n d to
those w h o uphold H i s L a w , those w h o
enjoin what is right and forbid what is
wrong. H e does not favour a people of a
particular race or colour but people of good
faith a n d action.
" W e ordained for the children of Israel
That i f anyone slew
A person—unless it be
F o r murder or for spreading
mischief i n the L a n d —
It w o u l d be as i f
H e slew the whole of m a n k i n d ( K o r a n 5:35)
