Presidents Report T o I C U
G r a v e l at H a r l i n g t o n
College has been aware for several years that there have been significant
deposits o f gravel at H a r l i n g t o n . In fact gravel is being extracted f r o m a site
adjacent to the College sports field by Streeters. T h e estimated royalty that
IC could expect to earn is estimated at £1.1 m. H o w e v e r , we have been unable
to confirm this figure because we could not place the more detailed facts
before o u r professional adviser. W e have attempted to establish certain
precedents concerning the purchase o f H a r l i n g t o n that mean that any monies
raised s h o u l d be put towards student athletic facilities.
It is important that the U n i o n monitors this because extraction w o u l d
• seriously affect the space available for sports at H a r l i n g t o n .
I therefore ask this meeting to approve m y proposal that o u r support for
this scheme will be conditioned o n the provision o f at least thirty acres o f
H a r l i n g t o n being playable at any one time. In a d d i t i o n we s h o u l d be fully
involved in the decision m a k i n g process and supplied w i t h a l l the necessary
i n f o r m a t i o n .
Bars
F o l l o w i n g the m o t i o n which was passed at the last U G M I informed B o b
Schroter o f my mandate a n d m y intention to jolly it up. H e then spoke to
J o h n S m i t h a n d B r i a n L l o y d D a v i e s , a n d wrote back with a set o f proposals
that C o u n c i l overwhelmingly accepted and that C o u n c i l recommends to the
U G M .
T h e proposals are as follows:
1. T h a t Bars Subcommittee has access to the i n d i v i d u a l trading accounts
given that these are treated in confidence and are not publicised outside the
committee. A n y breach i n confidence will result i n these figures being
w i t h d r a w n .
2. B o b Schroter confirmed that the B a r Subcommittee C h a i r m a n will
continue to n o r m a l l y be an I C U n o m i n a t i o n appointed by the Refectory
C o m m i t t e e C h a i r m a n .
3. W i t h reference t o the T e r m s o f Reference, B o b Schroter stands by the
Refectory C o m m i t t e e terms o f reference a n d states that they have been k n o w n
to a l l preceding B a r Subcomittee chairmen.
O n behalf o f C o u n c i l I r e c o m m e n d acceptance.
Residence
Student Services have proposed a scheme that will assure all first years o f a
place i n H a l l a n d will prioratize postgraduates in the f o l l o w i n g w a y :
1. high fee paying overseas students
2. other overseas students
3. departmental recommendations
4. women o n M S c courses
5. men o n M S c courses
6. women in research courses
7. men in research courses
this depends o n the full usage o f Intercollegiate H a l l s and the maintenance o f
o u r H e a d Tenancy agreements.
I a m in the process o f selecting applicants f o r interview concerning the post
of Welfare Assistant at Student Services.

1. F o l l o w i n g a spate o f thefts f r o m the U n i o n G y m and changing rooms
the d o o r at the back o f the mens c h a n g i n g r o o m s has been l o c k e d ;
unfortunately it has not been possible to d o this in the ladies as it is a fire exit.
Since the small lockers for valuables have not been sufficient the large c o i n -
return lockers are n o w being restored—20 are n o w operational and the other
28 will be completed before the end o f term. I a m l o o k i n g into installing
lockers i n the ladies changing r o o m s as well.
2. T h e U n i o n B u i l d i n g is to be extensively redecorated this year with the
central staircase being totally repainted and the Senior C o m m o n R o o m being
redecorated a n d totally refurnished. T h e U p p e r L o u n g e should also be
i n c o r p o r a t e d i n this scheme.
T h i s is part o f a new policy to redecorate the whole U n i o n B u i l d i n g over
this a n d next year w h i c h I hope to see carried o n , w o r k i n g up from the ground
floor.
Estimates have been obtained a n d I envisage w o r k to start immediately
after C h r i s t m a s a n d the whole o f this years part o f the project t o be finished
by the second week in F e b r u a r y .
3. I have tidied u p the West Staircase as m u c h as is possible and w o u l d
appreciate it i f all those clubs w h o sweep all their rubbish out o f the G y m
o n t o the West Staircase stopped. In future I will have rubbish bags there, so
please use them.
4. T h e results o f the H o u s e C o m m i t t e e questionnaires w h i c h requested
i n f o r m a t i o n f r o m all clubs and societies as to what facilities they needed in
a d d i t i o n to those a l r e a d y p r o v i d e d have been c o l l a t e d a n d f o u r new
cupboards have been ordered to help cope with the large demand for
c u p b o a r d storage space. I have also asked about the possibility o f putting
three a d d i t i o n a l noticeboards i n the J C R a n d hope for a positive response
f r o m College i n the near future, as d e m a n d for noticeboards i n this area is
heavy.
5. F o r those w h o are not aware, the kitchen area behind the o l d refectory is
being converted into storage facilities f o r E n t s w h o will be based there. T h e
refectory will then be used for various discos, etc. T h i s work is almost
complete and this area s h o u l d be fully operational b y the beginning o f next
term.
6. The lock o n the cleaning c u p b o a r d has been changed and a new stock of
mops, buckets a n d b r o o m s obtained t o enable us t o provide adequate
facilities to clean u p after large functions without a shortfall in equipment. In
future it will be necessary to obtain a key i n advance f r o m me for a deposit if
cleaning materials are required after a n y event.
