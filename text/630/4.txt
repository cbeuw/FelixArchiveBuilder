Queensgate?
Dear Sir
I have read with interest the
recent articles in F E L I X con-
cerning the College bar accounts.
After 'ast week's development
( " B a r Accounts Open") , I a m
moved to put pen to paper.
P e r h a p s I a m n o w g e t t i n g
rather long in the tooth and my
memory is failing me, but at the
back of my m i n d I recall once
being able to read in F E L I X that
the profit and loss figures for the
refectories and the bars. N o w it
seems we're to be given less than
that.
F r o m all the discussion the
legal position of the bars seems
to have been omitted. The bars
in College operate under a ' C l u b
certificate', whereby the sale of
alcoholic beverages is permitted
to members of the club. This
club is the I C Refectory C l u b ,
which every student and member
o f s t a f f o f the C o l l e g e is a
member of. N o rules or consti-
t u t i o n , p e r h a p s c o n v e n i e n t l y ,
appear to exist for this club.
Is it not a strange state of
affairs that the members of a
club can not and may not see the
accounts for their o w n club. I
hardly think that the members of
I C U w o u l d tolerate a similar
situation if this was the case with
the U n i o n .
We hear a great deal these
days about the accountability of
businesses to their workforce. A t
Imperial College, seemingly, we
are producing a generation of
future managers who are taught
that not only is accountability
u n n e c e s s a r y b u t it is a l s o
u n d e s i r a b l e . It w o u l d seem
instead that secrecy i n financial
matters is the lesson of the day.
By now R i c h a r d N i x o n no
d o u b t g r e a t l y r e g r e t s e v e r
m a k i n g the statement " T h e r e
will be no cover-up at the White
H o u s e " . W i l l this then be IC's
'Watergate'. If there is nothing
to h i d e , w h y h i d e it? S u c h
needless s e c r e c y is the v e r y
f e e d s t o c k o f m a l i c i o u s a n d
unfounded rumour. In the words
o f the g r e a t e s t ' f a n ' i n the
business, " S h o u l d we be told?"
Yours faithfully

I told
you so?
Guildshit... again
Dear Martin
I am writing to you because I
feel that your article " G u i l d s h i t
H i t s the F a n " suggests that
Guildsheet is c a r r y i n g out a
campaign against Nick Pyne,
this is just not the case.
Five issues of Guildsheet have
been produced this term, only
two small articles on N i c k Pyne
have been published (issues 2,4).
This does not seem to me to be
the "series of attacks on himself
i n s e v e r a l i s s u e s " t h a t y o u
mention on your front page,
p a r t i c u l a r l y as i n the s a m e
period we have criticised M i k e
B a r t l e t t three t i m e s , G o r d o n
Bowser three times, Engineering
B o a r d , B a r C o m m i t t e e , a n d
Stephen G o u l d e r all twice as
well as Steve Bishop, J o C l a y d o n
and Brian Shindler once each.
I a m quite content to stand by
the contents of Guildsheet,to the
extent of vigorously defending
any action M r Pyne may take
against us in the courts!!!
Yours bemusedly

Dear Martin
T w o weeks ago, I entered
the F E L I X Office to ask you
about the copy deadline, since I
h a d been a s k e d to w r i t e an
article for your paper by Chess
C l u b . Y o u asked what it was
about, and when I told you, you
recommended that I should not
bother as you probably would
not publish it because no one
would be interested. A n y w a y I
wrote it and submitted it, a n d , of
course, you did not publish it. I
do not k n o w , or particularly
care, why it was not published
( b a d l y w r i t t e n , o r n o o n e
interested), but what does worry
me is that when a society such as
C h e s s C l u b d o e s s u b m i t a n
article, its first of the year no
less, that it is ignored. We do not
d e m a n d , a s k f o r , o r e x p e c t
massive coverage, but it would
be nice to be a c k n o w l e d g e d
when we do contribute to what is
as m u c h o u r n e w s p a p e r as
anyone else's. Other societies, eg
S c i F i , c o n t r i b u t e b o r i n g ,
meaningless and usually unin-
formative drivel every week and
have it published.
One of the reasons you gave
me for probably not publishing
was lack of space. This, one can
clearly see, is your policy so as to
stop societies contributing. It
seems r i d i c u l o u s to me that
societies in A C C receive two
pages (three this week) in which
they wrote reports which are
o n l y r e l e v a n t to t h e i r o w n
members, a point on which you
criticised me (indeed, they even
put in team lists which very few
of us could give a d a m n about),
yet R C C , S C C , C C U s and the
Bookshop all have to share one
page. Y o u m i g h t c l a i m that
s p o r t s t e a m s r e p r e s e n t t h e
C o l l e g e , but this f a l l s d o w n ,
because so do Chess C l u b (my
article concerned one such event,
if you read it). I C Chess C l u b is
the strongest c o l l e g i a t e chess
club in L o n d o n , entering two
teams for the U L U league and
four for the U L U knock-out, as
well as being the only College to
enter a team (two, in fact) in a
league outside of the University.
The conclusion of this letter is,
please if, or when, we submit
another article, do not dismiss it
because you regard us as insigni-
ficant (a lot of people at I C are
interested i n chess, even if they
do not belong to Chess C l u b ) ,
and, more generally, no society
should be regarded too insigni-
f i c a n t f o r a m e n t i o n i n the
newspaper of Imperial College
U n i o n , if they ask for such a
mention, or a small amount of
s p a c e , b e c a u s e p e o p l e a r e
interested in societies to which
they do not belong.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
The accusation made in last
w e e k ' s F E L I X t h a t I h a v e
carried out character assassina-
tions of Nick Pyne in Guildsheet
is totally false.
Guildsheet has not published
" a series of attacks" on N i c k
Pyne, nor is the 'Hissing S i d '
column written solely by myself
as was stated in F E L I X . Further-
more I was not the author of the
piece in the previous issue of
Guildsheet that N i c k Pyne took
exception to.
A l l that I have written for
Guildsheet has been, I believe,
f a i r c o m m e n t on matters of
public interest.
I am sure it is not in the
interests of either G u i l d s or N i c k
Pyne to become involved in a
long and acrimonious dispute.
Why can't the E d i t o r of Guild-
sheet and Nick Pyne discuss their
d i f f e r e n c e s i n a n a d u l t a n d
amicable way and let the matter
end there? Yours faithfully

PS: I t h o u g h t Guildshit was
hilarious too.
Dear Martin
I realise that the subject of
' G u i l d s h i t ' m a y be o l d a n d
perhaps weary, but I would like
to c l a r i f y the s i t u a t i o n a n d
correct c e r t a i n c o m m e n t s i n
your editorial.
I personally, along with C B
and F r a n k , took no exception to
the p u b l i c a t i o n , c o n t e n t o r
distribution of 'Guildshit'; along
with Steve G o u l d e r and yourself
I found it highly amusing. It was
purely the removal of Guildsheet
which was annoying as people
had been w o r k i n g all night to
enable us to d i s t r i b u t e it o n
Wednesday morning, and the
f a c t it c o n t a i n e d m a t e r i a l
specifically related to M o r p h y
D a y . A s yourself k n o w Messers
Pyne and Barnett have apolo-
g i s e d a n d a g r e e d t h a t t h e
r e m o v a l o f Guildsheet w a s
wrong; I thank them for their
apologies.
Y o u r e d i t o r i a l r e f e r r e d to
heavies and suggests physical
intimidation; when I went to
f i n d M r B a r n e t t t h e r e w e r e
indeed six people with me; most
of w h o m would not be described
as 'heavies'. The purpose of this
was to enable rapid redistribu-
tion of Guildsheet and obtaining
the missing copies. I personally
asked M r Barnett for the copies,
explaining reasons why this was
necessary. T h e s e he a c c e p t e d
a n d r e t u r n e d the c o p i e s i n
approximately fifteen minutes.
Y o u mention official channels; it
was felt that speed in obtaining
the missing copies was of prime
i m p o r t a n c e , a n d this speedy
r e t u r n w a s t h e o n l y m a j o r
r e q u i r e m e n t ; t h u s r e n d e r i n g
official channels as a secondary
c o n s i d e r a t i o n . A s y o u k n o w
Steve was informed, so as to
keep him in the picture.
W i t h reference to the copies of
' G u i l d s h i t ' i n o u r p o s s e s s i o n
these were those from Elec E n g ,
these have now been distributed
from the G u i l d s Office to people
who came in asking for them.
Yours sincerely
