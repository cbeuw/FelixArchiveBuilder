. the l a t t e r c r i t e r i o n , the Society
i s to i>e. Highly commended, f o r there can
have Lee:, few i n the audiences that,
however wel they knew the plot before,
f a i l e d to h. a.nused b the antics of the
Lord Chancellor, impressed by the s t r i k -
ing entry f the years, and delighted by
the sin-in:; and dancing of the f a i r i e s .
however, though usually dangerous
to generalise, i t i s f a i r to say that as
a whole the d i c t i o n throughout t h i s pro-
duction was good, but that the action
and dialogue were too slow to keep the
plot moving: thi3 does not r e f e r to a l l
the characters, ana may i n part have
been due to the i n a b i l i t y of the orches-
t r a to set a f a s t e r pace.
Here i s one of the .veal; links i n an
amateur production: i t i s possible to
bring the singers to a higher standard
than the orchestra f o r the ss ne amount
of rehearsal time, and i n the case of
the Society's performance of Mozart's
Mass i n C. Minor l a s t term, this was
overcome by using a professional orch-
estra.
The lead was taken by John Coleman
as the Lord Chancellor: his performance
was w e l l polished and did much to hold
the other actors together, though he
tended to speak rether than sing some of
his sones.
The t i t l e part was played oy Alexan-
dra M i l l s , and while her sinking was
pleasant i t was inaudible at times, and
was not accompanied by s u f f i c i e n t f a i r y -
l i ' - - a c t i o n : s u r p r i s i n g l y , the female
lead .vas stolen by Daphne G i l l as P h y l l i s ^
the Ward i n Chancery, f o r her beautifully
c l e a r singing was backed by ^orae of the
best and most natural acting of the eve-
ning.
Strephon, 3uitor to P h y l l i s , was
portrayed by Roger Atkins, and he was
convincing, with a very good voice,
u n t i l he came to the spoken dialogue:,
but he .vas not alone i n t h i s , for
Timothy Dhonau and Richard iValmsley as
the two e a r l s u i t o r s to P h y l l i s had the
sane f a i l i n g . During t h e i r argument
outside the nouses of Parliament, the
action was sc slow that the a l i e n e e
became restless. Surely this f a u l t
could have e a s i l y beer evoided without
loss c l a r i t y ?

MY FIRST VISIT TO LONDON
There i s r.o doubt that the f i r s t
/ i s i t to London surprises most v i s i t o r s ,
the reason being that London i s so very
large the most immense and widespread
town i n the world, i n faot a world unto
i t s e l f . I cannot begin to count how
aany hours I have spent i n reaching;the
interesting spots, although I have been
Living i n the centre.
London, where the everyday crimes,
burglaries, murders and thefts are as
com;ion as the dust-infected a i r . At
the beginning,. I was not merely vtruok
by reading, some "LtaaauB* d a i l y news-
papers which-feed t h e i r readers with
these s t o r i e s , but also by finding tha.
they formed the p.ist of the whole con-
tents.
Just one word about the a i r : never
before could I have believed that such
a f i l t h y a i r could pervade a town, and
I am astonished that l i f e i s possible
i n i t for 8 m i l l i o n people.
Transport i s another problem:
actually, I consider the Underground well
constructed and organised, and the best
means of t r a v e l l i n g long distances i n
town i n a short time.
I met more foreigners i n London
than English people themselves: I dare
say that London i s a more exciting cos-
mopolitan town than you may f i n d anywhere
Everything goes the other way round, and
a Continental has to get accustomed to
i t a l l f i r s t .
I would l i k e to praise the car.
drivers' d i s c i p l i n e which i s excell* .
-
and ought to be imitated by those on the
Continent. They take much heed of ped-
estrians, but many pedestrian-egpf i ngs
are very dangerous indeed and often cause
t r a f f i c jams. But why are.*ihftre nnt
more subways to reach the opposite side?
I have very much appreciated the .
opportunities for entertainment offered
by theatres and concerts, and also by
the large number of museums. Never
s h a l l I forget the many hours I have
spent wandering around them.
In a i d i t i o n , a thought about l i v -
ing accommodation. I t i s much easier
to f i n d suitable lodgings i n London than
i n a Continental c i t y : but the question
of food i s enough to upset most v i s i t o r s '
stouaohs because your form of nourish- 4
ment i s so d i f f e r e n t . I am sure an
English person can more e a s i l y become
accustomed to Continental food than the
contrary.
Furthermore, I would l i k e to stre3:
that a foreigner has great d i f f i c u l t y i n
getting i n touch with English people.
*ney are very cold and reserved.
F i n a l l y , may I say that I enjoyed
ky stay i n England very much, and that
i t was a very important and instructive
period for me. Naturally I am very
happy to be returning to my home i n
Switzerland, where I hope I s h a l l soon
-neet you again.

A good performance was gicen by
Nina Currie as the Queen of the d a i r i e s :
she understood the part, and her height
and voice were w e l l - s u i t e d . Her l a s t
resort f o r a husband, Private W i l l i s , was
most oommendably played ty Richard
Hazell
r-ence the problems to be faced by
Frank Kennard, the musical d i r e c t o r , and
Peter Rodway, the producer, were indeed
large: to what extent were they solved?
The answer i s l i k e l y to be different fxaa
each person who saw the show, but there
i s no doubt at a l l that i t was a <?ood

PLEASE NOTE
The Editor has heard some complain.*
from the musically minded section, of
the College that the Dramatic Society
get far too much space in Felix by

With this in nind the Editor
has published this review of l a s t
