A party of c y c l i s t s from I.C.
together with 2 r e c r u i t s from U.C.
and one from Birmingham, spent nine
days together c y c l i n g i n the south
west.
We met at Exeter Youth Hostel
and on the f i r s t day journeyed t o
Minehead, by way of Tiverton and Tarr
steps. The morning being spent i n
some i n t e r e s t i n g lanes between Exeter
and Tiverton, and the afternoon i n
negotiating some unsurfaced roads t o
Tarr Steps.
On the second days run t o Ins-cow
a rash bet about the p o s s i b i l i t y o f
r i d i n g up Porlock H i l l resulted i n one
member of the party being exhausted
for the rest of the day, and a round of
cider, at the close of the tour, from
the l03er. The afternoons route l a y
along a disused road that clung t o the
edge of the c l i f f s near Parraocnbe,
paroviding excellent views of the cost.
The following day was marred by
a broken back axle i n the a r l y a f t e r -
noon, a f t e r v i s i t s t o Westward HoJ and
C l o v a l l y . The rest of the proposed
i t i n e r y had t o be cancelled, and after
a Makeshift r e p a i r we had a hurried
r i d e t o Otterham Youth Hostel, t o arrive
just i n time f o r supper.
The f i s h i n g v i l l a g e of Boseastle
was approached on the following morn-
ing through the 'Valence' v a l l e y , a sore
point with the chemists amongst us.
The headland there i s pierced by a
natural tunnel, and heavy seas were
spouting through, most of the party
getting wet i n an endeavour t o get
closer t o the tunnel mouth.
The hostel at Treyamon i s magnifi-
cently situated on the edge of the c l i -
f f s , and as the morning was bright and
clear i t was some time before we dragged
ourselves away t o v i s i t Pedrouthan
Steps, Newquay, Truro and the b e a u t i f u l
church of St. Just i n Roseland before
continuing t o Boswinger hostel.
The popular coastal resorts o f
Mevagissey, Fowey, Polperro and Looe
were v i s i t e d on the next day, and a l -
though at the height of the';holiday sea-
son t r a f f i c wa3 surprisingly l i g h t .
One of our friends from U.C. was un-
fortunate i n snapping a saddle p i l l a r
just before reaching the hostel a t
L o s t w i t h i e l , but with the help of a
Guildsman i t was successfully patched
up i r i ~e morning, p r i o r t o a run direct
to Plymouth, where we were entertained
i n t h - homes of two of our friends from
I.C.
The l a s t day saw us venture up t o
Princetown, where a storm of driving
sleet made us a l l resolve t o be good
students. The r e s t of the day was
f i n e , and we had a ple.sant ride t o
Dartmeet bridge, Buokfast Abbey and
Brent t o arrive at Bigbury on Sea hos-
t e l j u s t before dusk. A f t e r 3upper we
found the nearest hostelry along some
narrow paths to a neighbouring v i l l a g e ;
i t was here that the round of cider was
provided by the loser of the e a r l i e r
bet. The pubs name was of course "The
Journeys End Inn", which we thought
most f i t t i n g .

The morning of Saturday, 21 st
March saw 36 impatient Guildsinen
waiting f o r the "of;1
" to Paris.
Enthusiasm was high, too high f o r
one who i n h i s haste got a £4 speeding
t i c k e t . The college subsidy was given
out; thanks to the generosity of Profs.
Saunders, Squire, TustLn, Skempton and
Danckwerts. Saturday evening found
Ouildsmen i n P i g a l l e , Montmartre, jazz
clubs and other unusual places on the
l e f t bank. Sunday was grey and hazy
both from the point of view of the
weather and our heads.
A week of v i s i t s followed, the
highlights of which wan that to C.N. I.T.
a large exhibition h a l l i n the shape o f
a leaf that only touches the ground at
three points, whose amazing construction
»as explained to us by the Chief Engineer
The sorting department of the
French Railways, from whom B r i t i s h
Railways could learn a l o t , impressed
the party by i t s efficiency i n carrying
out i t s very complicated task. At the
Hydraulics Ijab. M. Laurent, an o l d
friend of Professor White, provided an
interesting tour round models of ports
and r i v e r s . A v i s i t to the Renault
factory nearly depleted the party's
numbers as the roads there are used as
a test racing track.
The return.trip was somewhat o f
a nightmare, an overdose of wines and
pleasure combined with the lack o f
sleep, and a bumpy passage was quite
sickening.

bunch comprising T i l l y , Jaeger, and two

M. Barber (l.C.) who had oaught and
