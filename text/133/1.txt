IRVING EXPOSED
A N A S S E S S M E N T
O F T H E F A C T S
Recent events involving the C a r n i v a l
magazine, Carnival Times, have shed new
l i g h t on the controversy that raged a r -
ound the Winter Fhoenix, which culminated
i n the dismissal of i t s Editor, D.J.
I r v i n g and a slanging match before a
packrd Union Meeting. Irving was d i s -
missed from the Editorship of Phoenix
early l a s t term, and shortly afterwards
at a meeting o f the U.L.U. - W.U.S.
Carnival Committee, which includes a
member o f the I.C.U. Council, he was
appointed E d i t o r o f the Carnival Times,
which was intended Â»s a rag magazine.
A P A R T H E I D
On Th-irsday 24th A p r i l , there appea
red a t I.C. proofs of the centre eight
pages of Carnival Times. These pages
included an a r t i c l e supporting Apart-
heid, and derirKrg those members of the
University who protested against
the South African U n i v e r s i t i e s B i l l ,
with a car+oon i n the same vein. The
E d i t o r i a l Stated that B r i t i a n had been
on the wrong side i n the 1939 - 1945
war and subsequent campaigns, and
claimed that H i t l e r ' s regime was "the
f i r s t great unifying force that Europe
hasimown f o r s i x hundred years".
N E G R O C A R T O O N
On the following Friday, Miss H i l d a
Browne General Secretary of W.U.S., was
informed o f the imminent appearance of
these a r t i c l e s . She telephoned David,
Jaques, Chairman of the V.'.U.S. Carnival
Committee and was reassured by him that
matters were under control. Jaques,
nevertheless, thought i t necessary t o
telephone I r v i n g , t o inquire whether
anything had been printed which Irving
had not shown him. I r v i n g denied t h i s
and could not r e c a l l a cartoon concern-
ing negroes.
j o u r days elapsed before Doug. Smith,
E d i t o r of Sennet, v i s i t e d the p r i n t e r
and unearthed f i f t e e n thousand copies
of the centre eight pages. Only f i v e
days were l e f t i n which to a l t e r , produce
and distribute,the magazine. The r e -
p r i n t i n g considerably increased the oo
oost. I t i s hardly credible that some-
one should r e s o r t to such deceit, i n
order t o embarass and f i n a n c i a l l y deprive
a charity l i k e W.U.S.
WHICH
W.U.S. i s a s t r i c t l y n o n - p o l i t i c a l
ion-sectarian organisation; i t s sole
aim i s the welfare of students.
Irving's a r t i c l e s were both p o l i t i c a l
and sectarian. I f Published they would
inevitably have caused great embarass-
ment to W.U.S. I t seems apparent that
Irving knew t h i s ; why otherwise should
he attempt t o conceal them?
E N T E R T A I N M E N T O N L Y
At Irving's insistence Carnival
Times was printed on best quality news-
p r i n t . This had to be s p e c i a l l y manu-
factured, considerably increasing the
cost of the magazine. There i s no
shortage of witnesses to h i s declared
intention to entertain ratherrthan make
a p r o f i t . Does Irving believe that
p r o f i t s and entertainment are incompat-
i b l e i n a charity magazine? Whilst
f i n a n c i a l and p o l i t i c a l embarassment may
not have been h i s primary aims, he has
achieved both.
Another issue raised by these events
i s that o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t y . How could
a lmember o f I.C. Union Council with
fresh memories o f tendentious statements
i h Phoenix and f r i c t i o n on the E d i t o r i a l
Board, allow the U.L.U. - W.U.S. Committ-
ee on which he s i t s to appoint Irving
without i n s i s t i n g on adequate safeguards.
W E E K ?
On FridV-' , A p r i l 24th. Jaques knew
that proofs of the a r t i c l e s were a v a i l -
able, yet no v i s i t t o the p r i n t i n g wotrk
was made u n t i l the following Tuesday.
In t h i s time, the majority of the f i f t e e n
thousand copies were printed. A prompt
inspection would have saved a consider-
able sum of money.
H O R R O R A T U.C.
On A p r i l 30th, P I - the newspaper
of University College - headlined this
"Neo-fascist Threat" and commented" i t
was not the ideas expressed that aroused
the horror and indignation o f every-
body, so much as the fact that a student
should abuse h i s position i n t h i s way"
PI understandably expresses horror
and indignation a t t h i s abuse of p r i v i
lege, but the ideologies that promote
such abuse should not go uncondemned.
A C H A L L E N G E
h. I.C. men attempted a round t r i p
London to Land's End over the l a s t week-
end, leaving I.C. a t 6.45 on Friday
evening. The successful pair returned
to College by 2 o'clock on Sunday a f t e r -
noon. The other p a i r , although they
returned to I.C. oy 8.30 Sunday morning,
reached only Penzance. FULL STORY IN-
