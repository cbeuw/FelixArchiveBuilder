THE RUGBY TOUR EI CORNWALL -
21 s t - 26th March.
Everyone had a small wager on the
Grand National on that fine Saturday as
we t r a v e l l e d to Cornwall. The excite-
ment of the race was no more intense
than i n the coach as we clustered round
the radio. I t was an anti-climax as
Bregashti - the bookie announced that he
held the s l i p of the winner.- Oxo. The
stops of course were frequent, but the
most memorable was at the Jamaica Inn
on Bodmin Moors where we had our f i r s t
oggies. The fine weather of the f o l l -
owing day encouraged the more energetic
to explore the countryside around. x
Thi3 paid dividends because everyone
was i n fine drinking form that evening
i n the Penzance clubhouse.
Our f i r s t match was played Monday
evening against the l o c a l Penzance side,
whose winning run of f i v e months had been
ended cnly the previous week. Their
greater experience showed i n the speed
i n which they changed the direotion of
attack. I.C. were not disgraced i n
l o s i n g 9-0. The game followed the
same general pattern; a Penzance attack
would be broken down i n the three-
quarters by good t a c k l i n g and the b a l l
would be dribbled back i n t o the Pen-
zance h a l f , or kicked down the touch-
l i n e . The I.C. s p i r i t never weakened
and, near the end an I.C. ifeK almost
scored between the posts, being taok-
led only a yard from the l i n e . Every-
one r e t i r e d to the clubhouse afterwards
where steaming oggies were served up and
devoured mercilessly. The beer flowea
f r e e l y yet not a glass was broken.
Our manners were almost c i v i l i s e d .
Playing undor floodlights on
Tuesday was a new experience for most
of the team. The game, between two
roughly even sides, was uninteresting.
I.C. again l o s t , but the opinion of the
referee and that of both sides d i f f e r e d
on Occasions. On a muddy p i t c h , and
with a heavy b a l l s t i l l tacky with the
white paint, we were unable to score
from the many penalties we were awarded.
An intense attack i n the f i r s t h a l f a l l
but produced two t r i e s f o r I.C., f o r
they were stopped only by desperate
struggling on the goal-line. A f t e r a
qu. st hour i n the clubhouse with the
l o c a l s we returned to the hotel f o r
beer and song. B i l l the driver and
Bregashti the bookie took on our inn-
keeper and a local^sportsman at poker
a game i n which the l a s t two were
reputed to be experts. The I.C. team
were two pounds the r i c h e r when the
game ended.
HEAD OF RIVER RACE
The following afternoon we took
the coach to St. Ives f o r our l a s t
game. The scene of that early eve-
ning - blue sea, even bluer sky, the
c l e a r l y defined coastline sweeping
away i n a wide arc northwards around
Carbis Bay and below, the cottages o f
St. Ives set closely 'into the valley
which ran down to the harbour - was an
ideal setting more f o r a picnic than
a game of rugby. The match was drawn
6-6. each side serving a penalty goal
and a t r y . I.C. l e d u n t i l nearly the
end when St. Ives ware awarded a pen-
a l t y on the 25. The game was always
l i v e l y as both sides handled the b a l l
whenever possible, even when I.C. l o s t
t h e i r scrum h a l f at half time. The
interest was heightened further by
the altercations between the noisy I.C.
reserves and the red-faced Cornish
supporters who take a pride i n t h e i r
frankly aggressive attitude. The I.C.
linesman was t o l d that waving h i J f l a g
was not i t s only U3e.
That evening was a fine climax to
our tour, as we sang, and danced i n a
haze of oggies, sandwiches and beer.
Most of the men i n the room beoame Zulu
warriors during the soiree, while M i l -
ward turned out a four-star performance
to become President of the
Union. When the bar closet, we went
back to our hotel. The landlord was
asked whether he minded our forming a
scrum and knocking down one w a l l of the
lounge. Though i t was hardboard he
refused and turned his Alsatians loose
i n the h a l l . A small party decided.to
go A l s a t i a n hunting but we found that
t h i s was merely an excuse i n case a
P o l i c e o f f i c e r stopped them. The true
purpose was revealed afterwards i n the
shape of two 'acquisitions'. Now,
everyone who walks into the Union Office
w i l l see that Land's End i s only 9 miles
distant.
The s p i r i t of the side strengthened
from day to day, Our journey back t o
London was notably quiet, for the days
had passed too quickly. We had enjoy-
ed ourselves without being a nuisance.
In each town.the supporters and teams
were impressed not only with our rugby
but also with the s p i r i t and behaviour •
of everyone a f t e r tha game. A Penzance
newspaper t e s t i f i e d to t h i s when i t r e -
ported a f t e r Easter that our game had
been one of the most enjoyable evening
Hatches they had played.

The club has had 3 matohes so f a r
t h i s term. The f i r s t one was an
evening match against N.P.L. which Itas
abandoned due to bad l i g h t . The 2nd
team have since beaten Westminster
Hospital 7-1, w i t h one game unfinished,
ind the 'A' team l o s t an e x c i t i n g and
very even match against Calus College,
Cambridge, b6 6 games to 3.
The t r i a l s at the beginning of
term proved most encouraging and i t i s
hoped that the club w i l l have a more
successful season than i n the past few
years.

t r a d i t i o n a l Easter Course at Lasham
during the f i r s t week of the vacation.
The large attendance was amply reward-
ed with b e t t e r weather than i n the
immediately preceding years.
On the Wednesday and Thursday,
conditions were good and several soaring
f l i g h t s were made. On the f i r s t o f
these days, P a u l Minton flew h i s Sky-
l a r k I I I and climbed i n cloud to over
10,000 f e e t , to complete the height
t e s t f o r the 'Gold C C e r t i f i c a t e . He
thu3 beqoraes the f i r s t member of the
Imperial College G l i d i n g Club to obtain
•the 'Gold C* C e r t i f i c a t e . Meanwhile,
Prank Irving had been s i t t i n g i n a
meeting i n London, gazing out of the
window at the clouds. He arrived at
Lasham to hear that Paul had beaten
him t o the 'Gold C. Prank flew |he
Skylark T U the next day but i t was
not a he:ight day, and he had t o be
feontent with some l o c a l soaring at
2,500 t o 3,000 feet.
During the same period, David
Tomlin and Vemon Nicholas flew the
test f o r t h e i r 'C C e r t i f i c a t e s i n the
Olympia and several other members d e w
t h i s type f o r the f i r s t time.
Throughout the week, t r a i n i n g was
c a r r i e d out i n the two-seaters.
"Phoenix", our Skylark I I , was
brought back from the Midland G l i d i n g
Club where i t had spent the winter,
and two days work were required before
the ravages of the daim? winter had been
made good. I t was r-mdy on the Wed-
nesday and Roger V a i l e soared i t f o r
an hour and-a h a l f before a r a i n squall
foroed him to land.
Our next eveni. j.3 the National
ohampionships which are t o be held at
Lasham from. May 9th to 18th. Three
