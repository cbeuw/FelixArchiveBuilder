FELIX
WUS WEEK AT IC
The most examination-beset
among us oan hardly have failed
to realise that I.C. is in the
process of giving birth to one of
the greatest fund-rai3ing cam-
paigns in its history. The pangs
have been in evidence for the past
three months and the results of the
labours of Messrs. Newson and For3ter
and their stalwarts are manifestly
now upon us. True to form, I.C. i s
going one better than the rest of the
University; our W.U.S. Carnival Day is
lasting a week.
Our Own Private Procession
Devotees of processions w i l l have
bee'' f l i g h t e d to learn that we are
again having our own private process-
ion which will take plaoe this (Wednes-
day) afternoon. The object i s afain
to advettise the Carnival, and copies
of the Carnival magazine w i l l be sold.
Representatives of the I.C. W.U.S.
Committee were entertained to tea by
Scotland Yard last week; they were
released after questioning and emerged
with permission for the procession to
travel via Queen's Gate, Kensington
High Street, North End Road, Fulham
Broadway, Fulheun Road, Brorapton Road,
Cromwell Road and back up Exhibition
Road to the Union.
A good deal of enterprise has
gone into making up this advertising
nrooeesion. In addition to banner*
•edeoked student-type vehicles there
w i l l be six Kingsway Oigarette vans
from which free cigarettes will be
handed out.
Also taking part will-be
one stage coach as featured in the film
"Warlock* — this has been graciously
lenf"by~tlie Exploitation Manger of
20th Century Pox. (Thinks: we're
a go-ahead College, why can't we have
an Exploitation Manager?) Two or
three jazs bands will be accommodated
on separate lorries (they had better be
separate).
Clementine i s unfortunately
l a i d up with gastro-enteritis ( i . e .
b o i l e r trouble), but Jexebel and Bo w i l l
complete the cavalcade, which w i l l de-
part from Prince Consort Road at 1.30 pm,
Bspresso i n ijuadrangul.
Such components of the Union's
corporate t h i r s t as do not s a t i s f y them-
selves i n the Bar w i l l doubtless be xx
finding g r a t i f i c a t i o n i n the i n s t a l l a *
t i o n i n the quadrangle of a mechanism
for the creation, condensation and -sub-
sequent dispensation of student-type
nectar; to wit, Espresso coffee. The
apparatus i s housed i n the largest open-
air coffee shop under the sun — unless,
of oourse, i t rains. The aforesaid .'
dispensation takes place at lunch-timoe
and in the evenings. The coffee r e t a i l
at 6d. per goblet and we are previleged
to sup i t at the delicate hands of a
bevy of quite f a i r maidens of l o c a l
educational a f f i n i t y and closely vetted
talent, I'm glad to say. I f you don't
like musio there are jazz bands to pro-
vide an lanthentic Lyons Corner House
atmosphere.
Other fund-raising a c t i v i t i e s
currently proceeding are the Win-a-
Car r a f f l e — I.C. has reportedly sold
more tickets than any other College —
and a Balloon Race. Added interest i s
being lent by exhibits and tableaux xr.
from various overseas countries (cour-
tesy of the Commonwealth I n s t i t u t e ) ,
and by the Photographic Competition.

Carnival Saturday w i l l see the centre
of a t t r a c t i o n transferred to Bedford
Coll ego, which w i l l be the s t a r t i n g
and f i n i s h i n g point f o r a 30-float
profession i n which R.C."S. and Guilds
and Mines w i l l be represented. The
thene of the procession i s "The Shape
of Thing3 to Come". Mysterious reports
f i l t e r i n g through the security screen
indicate that, as we had long suspected
the Royal Col ege of Science i s nothing
but a F i c t i o n .
In addition to the resident attract
ions, the I.0. Coffee Bar w i l l reopen
in Regent's Park on Saturday and large
numbers of pilgrims are expected at th
t h i s well-known shrine. I.C. repres-
entatives of the gentle gender w i l l
be taking part i n a fashion show
and the Jazz Band i s forecast to take
partin the f i n a l s of the F e s t i v a l .
The evening w i l l be crowned by a
B a l l at St. Pancreas Town H a l l . The
blurb; says that the masks w i l l be
provided. Richard Harnett looked as i
i f he was wearing h i s the other day
but he t e l l s me i t was just the rings
around h i s eyes.
