By the time you read t h i s a r t i c l e
I expect that few of you w i l l need
reminding about W.U.S. week. P a r
most of us, t h i s i s a d i f f i c u l t term
- w i t h examinations, f i n a l work t o be
handed i n or the Prof, t o be avoided
just those few days more. Despite a l l
t h i s , I.C. i s putting i n what oan
only be c a l l e d a "mammoth" e f f o r t t o
make the Week a success. You w i l l
f i n d d e t a i l s elsewhere of the a c t i v i t i e s
that remain with whioh you can fend
off work a l i t t l e longer - I hope that
you w i l l entangle yourselves with s p i r i t
i n t o these a c t i v i t i e s , remembering the
cause behind the festivities'. Remem-
ber that t h i s i s not just a g l o r i f i e d
holiday during term-time; while few
students need encouragement to enjoy
themselves, i t would be a l l too easy
to forget that there i s a serious
purpose behind everything that happens
t h i s week.
As you w i l l read i n one of the
l e t t e r s opposite - i t i s the i n d i v i d u a l
e f f o r t that counts f o r so much - what
are you doing about W.U. S - what i s
your contribution? Help alii those
who are putting such great efforts t o
remove t h i s nasty taste from our
mouths; the taste of f i l t h and l i e s
which may cause the Comrittee t o
lose some of the money i t desperately
needs f o r charity.
I would l i k e to reassure Mr.
P h i l i p Emerson that I have no intention
of mentioning h i s s t a t e l y passage
through the Quad. Union-wise, w i t h h i s
s h i r t - t a i l flapping i n the breese.
I oould of course, make much of t h i s -
a headline reading "Emerson's End i n
Sight" - but a f t e r a l l , i t just i s not
done t o wash d i r t y l i n e n i n public.

As a demonstration of enterprise
(and o r i g i n a l l y as part of the W.U.S.
p u b l i c i t y e f f o r t ) , four I.C, students -
as stated on the front page - made the
c i r c u l a r tour t o Land's End over the
l a s t weekend. From Houn3low, which
they reached by the uncivilised method
of the Tube - where the p?arty a p l i t i n -
to two - they took respective l i f t s , x
which eventually took the groups on
their way West. Whereas the Ai.-.st' i r
Brash-Malcolm Clare ootnbinat: r
-n reached
Land's End by mid-day Sntuj-day, the
David Fearn- Malcolm Clare combination
reached only as f a r a3 Penzance at about
the same time. The l a t t e r group found
a l i f t with a Hunter p i l o t for 120 miles
on the return t r i p . The f i r s t group
were given a l i f t by a charming lady
who took them a l l the way from Calne
to I.C. front door.
The two groups arrived looking l i t t l e
the worst for wear - the Pensance men
at about 8 o'clock and the Land's enders
lay a*>out 2.
We wish t o congratulate them and
extend t h e i r challange t o a l l other
col:eges with some spifcit to t r y
and beat i b i s record - they ap.ear t o
think that i t could be done with easel

Congratulations are due to the
I.C. Jass Club f o r t h e i r magnificent
hop l a s t Saturday Night. When the
"House Band" sat i n with the v i s i t o r s
- the Sandy Brown - Fairweather a l l -
Stars - then the Conoert H a l l heard
l i v e music such as i t has never heard.
Dancing, which had proceeded space
the entire evening slowed at this point
to enable the fans to concentrate, and
j o i n i n with the numbers - "A-train"
and,"When the Saints". After t h i s ,
although i t was well a f t e r time, the
crowd asked for more. Sandy Byown
closed the evening with some deft piano-
work. A very stimulating hop, ^ny
faults - w e l l , i t did "seem as i f tp.lf
London had gained admission, but per-
haps some people r e a l l y enjoy dancing
on the c e i l i n g .
" h a l f a s h a r e "
We are pleased to announce i n res-
ponse to many inquiries that Allan,
Lewis's musical play - "Half a Share"
w i l l be performed next term.
