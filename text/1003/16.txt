The TiNTiN Music Cassette sits proudly at the
head of the page and potentially, at least, within
its coils are some of the most worthy sounds to
have graced the music pages between October
1993 and June 1994.
Startings are important, and Yo La Tengo
know how to do it properly. Not only did their
album 'Painless' get the first full marks of year,
but they prompted the comment: "'Painless' is
as close to perfect sublimity as I've met." Pretty
meaningless, huh. Pavement, on the other hand,
were a band out to prove their sanity. The
album, 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain', saw them
adding joists rather than knocking off the edges
of their previous work. Nevertheless, the loaded
irrevelancy contained within the line, "I care, I
care, I really don't care, did you see the
drummer's hair?" went a long way to fixing
them as the band for self-effacing slackers.
Baby Chaos managed three singles during
this time. Producing tracks with the edge of
'Buzz' shows that being on a major record label
is not the dubious proposition often claimed.
Productive in the extreme were Madder Rose. I
remember buying their first single this time last
year yet, since then, two albums have been
released. 'Panic On', the second of their
offerings, shows them developing a style of their
own with 'Car Song' being the most
immediately intense track. Frank Black's
'Teenager Of The Year' has only been out for
three weeks, but already it is firmly established
as a masterful joke. 'The Vanishing Spies' is just
one track from any number that could have been
chosen.
Submarine pretended to be an American
band but were firmly British. 'Lynn Marie',
despite being a cover from Ultra Vivid Scene,
removed my heart with its sparseness. As for the
Smashing Pumpkins, they were as fully yankie
as could be without being John Wayne. 'Siamese
Dream' is probably the album of the year, if
such exists, and 'Sweet Sweet' is a little vignette
hidden between the more muscular monsters.
OK, so my Juliana Hatfield fixation is pretty
serious but 'Become What You Are' has the
ultimate second side and '/ Got No Idols',
despite its grammatical failings, is a cry which
we would do well to heed. Who or what
Michael Penn is I don't know, but 'Coal', from
the compilation 'Rare On Air Vol. V, is a small
slice of what real story telling is about.
The Cowboy Junkies produced what has
been seen as a lacklustre album with 'Crescent
Moon, Pale Sun' but 'Ring On The SUV stands
with anything they have done before. Margo
Timmins still has the voice of an angel, period.
Kurt's dead, 'All Apologies' seems fitting, even
if it is from their MTV unplugged set. And to
end side a, there is Lotion. 'Full Isaac' is
packed with the lyrical quirks which make great
albums; 'The Love Theme from Santo Gold' is
from an imaginary TV programme.
Side b tickles into being with a track from the
Tindersticks' eponymous album, 'Her'. All
Spanish guitars, it promotes a rare angry mood,
redolent with domestic violence. Heading back
into the past, Uzi reissued their 'Sleep Asylum'
ep. Fast, automatic and wearing its age lightly,
'Ha Ha Ha' is hewn from a psycho skyscrape.
God, strange, post-modern and post
industrial, buzz into rebirth on 'Lazarus' from
'The Anatomy of Addition'. And we bring you
Lush before we even bring the review. Whether
their new album, 'Split', embodies their latent
promise is a matter still to be decided. But the
track 'Blackout' roars in from the horizon like a
Harley D with a Ghetto Blaster strapped across
the petrol tank, pumping out the soundtrack from
your lost teen years. Hole's 'Rockstar', from
'Live Through This', is the playful, scared litany
of a conforming non-conformist, whilst 'Little
Miss Information plays on words sprung from
Grant Hart and his intelligent Nova Mob.
The Lemonheads 'Rest Assured' in their
'Come On and Feel...' album - "It's not what
you do to me, it's what you do without" - too
true. Primal Scream skated close to parody with
'Rocks' but maybe I'm just too serious a young
man. The 'No Alternatives' compilation proved
to be a gold mine and buried in the middle was
'Joe'd Out' from Barbara Manning. Intense
folk pop inspiring repetitive use of the word
gorgeous. Penultimately come the Red House
Painters. 'Sundays and Holidays' (an inspiring
multilayered acoustic strum past a mental
hospital) from the single 'Shock Me' is beyond
reproach before we slip, once again, into the lake
of cool which is Yo La Tengo. Enjoy and inhale.
