No Confidence In ICU President Reach For
The Skies
ICU President Andrew Wensley
BY THE NEWS T E A M
The future of Andrew Wensley as
Imperial College Union (ICU)
President is uncertain following a
motion of censure submitted for
today's Annual General Meeting
(AGM).
The motion, submitted by Rhian
Picton, Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) President, details a
number of his past inadequacies.
The allegations include: deliberate
misleading of a Union General
Meeting (UGM); negligence in the
execution of his duties in not bring-
ing a satisfactory constitution to
UGM for aproval; inabilty to per-
form his duties to a satisfactory
standard.
A letter leaked to Felix has indi-
cated the reasons for the submission
of the motion. The letter, from
College Registrar Peter Mee to Mr
Wensley, recommends that the
whole process of setting the new
constituion restarts at the "begin-
ning of the next session". Mr Mee
highlights in his letter the fact that
the constitution has not yet been
passed by even one U G M and
presumes "that the possibility of
getting it through two UGMs before
I need the papers to go out to the
Governing Body on 24 June no
longer exists."
The motion itself was submitted
after the deadline for motions (10th
June). This means that the decision
to present the motion to the AGM is

The cancellation of the Imperial
College Summer Ball has cost over
Â£1,000.
The ambitious event, organised
by the City & Guilds College Union
(C&GCU) aimed to attract up to
1,000 students to Silwood Park this
weekend. Paul Griffith, C&GCU
President, told Felix: "There's a lot
of disappointment on everyone's
part. "
The main source of problems
was the sheer size of the event. A
project of this magnitude had never
been attempted by C&CGU before
and it is thought that the current
Executive Committee had problems
securing sufficient funding in time.
The decision to cancel the event
was made on Friday 3rd June, the
at the discretion of the UGM Chair.
Following discussions with Mr
Wensley, the UGM Chair Paul
Thomas decided to reject the
motion. It is now thought that the
matter will be brought up under
Any Other Business.
Detailing her reasons for submit-
ting the proposal, Rhian Picton told
Felix: "Something needs to go on
record." She also slammed the pres-
ident, saying: "There is some seri-
ous misrepresentation going on."
Miss Picton was worried that ICU
was "operating under an illeagal
constition" as it has not yet been
passed at two UGMs. She also
stated: "it is my duty to inform my
Cancelled:
same day as the Ball was first
advertised in Felix. Some posters
advertising the ball have not yet
been taken down.
The lateness of advertising the
event is one of the criticisms being
fired at the C&GCU. Despite this
Mr Griffith assured that the cancel-
lation of the Ball was not due to
poor ticket sales: "Someone came
into the office today [Wednesday,
due to be the last day of ticket sales]
asking if they could have 20
tickets."
The Ball was to be a joint ven-
ture between C&GCU and the Halls
of Residence and it had originally
been hoped that the Halls would
contribute money 'up front' which
would have been used to pay off
deposits on some of the events.
Some Halls were however not
students what is going on."
Although Miss Picton has the
support of the four Constituent
College Unions she emphasised that
these were her own views and not
those of RCSU.
In his defence, Mr Wensley told
Felix: "Although the President is
responsible...there has to be the
political will" to get anything done.
When asked if he would resign fol-
lowing this motion he abruptly
replied "no". He also said that he
felt that the motion was "a petty
way " of dealing with the matter.
Today's AGM will be held at
lpm in the Union Lounge.

prepared to take the risk of losing
such a large amount of money.
According to Mr Griffith, C&CGU
still have the "goodwill of Silwood
and the contractors", and it is hoped
that the event will go ahead next
year, now that a lot of the prelimi-
nary organisation has already been
carried out.
Dismissing claims that C&GCU
had been too ambitious Paul
Griffith told Felix: "Unless you
have something unique you aren't
going to sell the event. Imperial
needs this event and we're going to
go ahead and do it."
If the Ball goes ahead next year
C&GCU will be approaching
companies about the possibility of
sponsorship. The decision to run the
Ball lies with next year's C&GCU
Executive Committee.

Marcus Krackowizer, a tetraplegic
Aeronautics student at Imperial
College, has won a Flying
Scholarship for Disabled People
from the International Air Tattoo
(IAT). The scholarship gives Mr
Krackowizer the chance to spend
six weeks learning to fly this sum-
mer in Atlanta, America.
IAT was set up in 1983 to hon-
our disabled World War II flying
ace Sir Douglas Bader. 95 disabled
people have so far learnt to fly with
of the scheme.
Mr Krackowizer, who earlier
this year completed the London
Marathon in his wheelchair, will be
presented with his Scholarship by
King Hussein of Jordan, one of the
scheme's sponsors, later this
month.
Censored
Tomorrow's issue of Cub, the
newspaper of Queen Mary and
Westfield College Union (QMWU)
will contain censored articles.
The staff of Cub had finished
preparing the current issue early
this week, due to come out today.
They then delivered the disk files to
the printers, based in South
London. Just over two hours later,
the President of QMWU, Fayaz
Saeed, is said to have arrived at the
printers with a disk containing
numerous changes to the issue. He
allegedly demanded access to the
original files, to make changes
including blanking out two news
articles (one of which concerned
his handling of the QMWU consti-
tution), removal of an opinion arti-
cle on his performance as president
and removal of three letters from
students. Any action of this type
would be illegal under the constitu-
tion of QMWU.
Another news story that is said
to have been blanked out concerned
previous trouble during the issue's
production. The issue's files had
been deliberately erased by an
unknown party when it was three
quarters of the way to completion.
Two days later, the templates on
which issues are based were also
erased.
The deadline for articles for the last issue is 5pm on Friday
