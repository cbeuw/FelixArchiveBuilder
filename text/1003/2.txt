Research Councils to Seek Quality
BY JOE MCFADDEN
The higher education funding coun-
cils last week called for more quali-
ty and less quantity from university
researchers.
The councils warned they will
no longer consider the number of
research papers published by staff
when awarding funding to a univer-
sity department. Instead, grants will
be allocated according to the quality
of a department's research.
The practice of assessing perfor-
mance by a publication count has
put university staff under immense
pressure to publish their work as
often as possible. According to
Bahram Bekhradnia, Director of
Policy for the English Funding
Council, this has forced researchers
into "premature publication, trivial
articles and breaking up a publica-
tion into a number of parts".
The next assessment of
university departments in 1996 will
rely on panels of academics and
industrialists to judge the quality of
research. A selection of staff mem-
bers' best publications will be sub-
mitted to the panels, with unpub-
lished work such as industrial
patents also taken into account. This
move is in response to criticism that
pure research is currently favoured
by funding bodies over work with
commercial applications.
There is concern, however, that
the ruling will cause the gap in
funding between leading institutions
and other universities to widen
further, effectively forcing some
universities to drop research
activities entirely.
Demand for University Courses Slows
BY MIKE INGRAM
The rate of increase of university
applications has dropped this year,
contrary to projections.
Figures released by the
Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service (UCAS)
revealed that 378,150 candidates
have applied for degree courses this
summer. This compares to a figure
of 377,767 applications at the same
time last year. The rise amounts to
just 0.1%, well below the 3%
growth predicted by experts.
Student numbers have nearly
doubled since 1988, during six
years of rapid growth in
applications.
These figures are said to prove
that the Government has already
achieved its targets for University
expansion. Ministers are now con-
centrating on increasing recruitment
by colleges of further education.
The Service has attributed this
year's levelling off of the expansion
to the upturn in the economy
encouraging more school-leavers to
apply for jobs rather than go to
University.
Potential students are also likely
to be put off by the Government's
decision to cut maintenance grants
by 10% annually for the next three
years. UCAS accepted the
detrimental effect of this reduction,
but said that the "saturation point"
in demand for University courses
may have been reached.
This is the first year in which the
new UCAS applications system has
been in operation, using the same
system for applications to both 'old'
and 'new' universities. Previously
they had been dealt with separately
by UCCA and PCAS.
The figures also show the wide
cultural distribution of applicants.
Overseas applicants numbered
35,567, making up 9.4% of the
total. Of these, 16,686 were from
other countries in the European
Union.
The most popular course was
teacher training, with a total of
162,459 applications. The other
favourites among young people
were business and management
with 140,892 applications, law with
111,983 applications, computer
studies with 66,883, medicine with
59,817 and english with 58,554
applications.
