Jack’s back
| Samurai
Jack
Anurag Deshpande
A
fter an 11
year hiatus,
cult-classic
Samurai Jack
makes a long
awaited return
to our screens. Wandering
samurai Jack is still locked in
an uphill battle against the
demon Aku, and still stuck in
a hellish future spawned from
him. Genndy Tartakovsky’s
aesthetic delight begins in
media res, as had become a
staple of the show’s original
run. An opening monologue
helpfully informs us that 50
years have passed since Jack
was thrown into an unfamiliar
future, and in that time he has
not aged. Not physically, at
least.
The Jack we find ourselves
following now is a shell of
his former self, haunted by
his continuing failure and the
spectres of his past, all while
still half-heartedly continuing
the struggle against Aku.
Tartakovsky’s signature blend
of beauty and terror works to
great effect once more here,
with the seamless transitions
of environment into Jack’s
hallucinations excellently
portraying his fragile mental
state.
Advances in technology
mean that the art in general
feels crisper, and the colour
pallet is more vibrant. This
allows the series’ minimal-
ist, yet potent, feel to shine
like never before. Jack’s
revamped design is imposing
and refreshing. Immediately,
the new armour, bike, and
guns generate intrigue and
hook new and old viewers
alike. Thematically, the
armour shows us that this is
not quite the Jack we used to
know. The increased reliance
on technology acts as a
crutch, revealing that even
though physically he remains
unchanged, psychologically
he has grown weary.
Narratively, Samurai Jack
seems to have evolved to
keep pace with its audience.
The traditional, self-contained
episode structure is cast off to
instead opt for a season-wide
arc. Parallel to Jack’s adven-
tures, we also follow seven
young girls being trained
by a cult to hunt down and
kill Jack. This sets up what is
likely to be one of the major
plot lines of the season, and
gives us an additional POV
character in the form of the
assassin, Ashi.
Her journey and introduc-
tion in this episode are a dark
mirror to Jack’s own. We
are given glimpses of what
she could be without her
conditioning, and it seems as
if her perspective will allow
for an interesting exploration
of how world views and per-
ceptions can shape us. The
episode also sets up a bundle
of narrative threads that will
hopefully come to fruition
throughout. The audience
is enticed by the mystery of
Jack’s missing sword, as well
as wondering how the world
has changed in 50 years.
Additionally, the series
also seems unafraid to tackle
more mature themes this time
around. It takes unflinching
looks at Jack’s guilt and
the nature of his hope and
despair. After 50 years, the
cracks are beginning to show.
Series creator
Tartakovsky
has

toon Network\Adult Swim
implied that this season will
be an exploration of the
hero’s journey. More specif-
ically, the creators hope to
explore what happens to the
hero as their journey begins
to stall.
The comedy and creativity
of the series are as lively as
ever, with the introduction
of a musical robot assassin
based on Sammy Davis Jr.

actor Tom Kenny, the robot

provides a fascinating tempo-
rary distraction. He serves as
a perfect counter-balance to
the episode’s darker aspects.
The brief moments of comedy
shine because of their
absurdity.
One notable omission from
the episode is Aku’s presence
(save for a small cameo).
Again, this adds to the sense
of mystique and, in addition,
creates an anticipation that is
likely to keep people coming
back. Granted, this may have
more to do with original
voice actor Mako’s
unfortunate
passing. All in
all, the latest
episode is
a worthy
contin-
uation
of the
series
and
deftly
builds
expecta-
tions for
the rest of
the season.
