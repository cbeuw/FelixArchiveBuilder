Could 2017 be the year of indie?
Sound of Silver, the band’s
first album, is one of the most
critically acclaimed albums
of the 21st
century with some
of the catchiest and most cre-
ative electronic/dance music
ever made. The band’s unique
sonic coupled with Murphy’s
comedically cynical lyrics
have cemented their place in
my most listened band on my
rather bloated six-year-old
iPod Classic. The band split
after only two albums but
returned last year for a festi-
val tour. I was lucky enough
to witness their 2am, two hour
set in Denmark which was
easily the best set I have ever
seen live.
Finally, there’s Father John
Misty. Though he’s probably
better known for his work as
part of the indie folk band
Fleet Foxes, his 2015 solo
album I Love you, Honeybear
was incredibly well critically
received, getting praise for
the same imaginative orches-
tral-pop melodies which
shot Arcade Fire to fame a
decade earlier. In contrast to
LCD Soundsystem’s wobbling
synths and complex drum
machines, Misty’s albums
ooze the same beautiful har-
monies which characterised
L
ast year, was almost
unquestionably the
year of hip-hop;
the genre saw a
huge influx of new
artists and the drop
of some absolutely massive
albums from established
names (From Chance the
Rapper’s Colouring Book
and A Tribe Called Quest’s
We Got It From Here…
Thank You 4 Your Service to
Kendrick Lamar’s Untitled
Unmastered). This explosion
in hip-hop isn’t going
anywhere any time soon
but, 2017 might just see a
resurgence of indie.
This year is set to see the
release of a number of new
albums from indie giants, such
as Father John Misty, Arcade
Fire and LCD Soundsystem
(yes, I know they were
supposed to have broken
up but I’m not complaining
and neither should you). And
if you’re about to say ‘Big
Whoop’, bear in mind that
it has been well over half
a decade since either LCD
Soundsytem and Arcade Fire
released This is Happening
and Reflektor respectively.
Arcade Fire were the
shining example of the late
90s/early 2000s diversifi-
cation in indie music. Whilst
journalists at the time were
throwing around terms like
‘landfill indie’ in response to
the slew of un-inventive bands
which were inundating record
shops, Arcade Fire managed
to catch the eye of Merge
Records and subsequently
produced one of the most crit-
ically acclaimed albums of the
decade, Funeral. Its daring
‘baroque pop’ sound was a
Joe O’Connell-Danes
subject matter of the lyrics.
So, are these three albums
enough to herald the return
of indie music? Who knows!
The biggest hurdle that these
albums need to overcome in
order for them to bring back
indie is to engage with the
counter-cultural roots of the
genre. Only then will they
make the impact the names
attached to the records
deserve.
The genre must climb down
from its romanticised past and
address the important social
and political climate into
which these records are about
to be released, if they are to
connect with their audience
in the same manner the post-
punk records of the mid-1980s
did. Furthermore, these music
legends must not be afraid to
develop their sound and take
influence from innovations in
the electronic music scene.
Get all of that right and we
could be in store for some
absolutely cracking albums
later this year.
his work in Fleet Foxes. Impor-
tantly, the indie folk scene
hasn’t been untouched by this
shift towards the experimental
and electronic. The modern
flagship names of the sub-
genre like Bon Iver and Sufjan
Stevens have all released new
music with a contemporary
flair whilst still preserving the
roots of the sonic. From what
we have heard of the first few
singles from Pure Comedy is
that Tillman is certainly intent
on making good his reasons
for leaving Fleet Foxes with
a considerably darker and
more political tone to the new
music. The singles move omi-
nously between keys to create
a pretty eclectic dissonance

sign of things to come as the
band dragged indie music
into a new, more electronic,
era.
LCD Soundsystem took this
move towards the electronic
and put it on steroids. The
band’s frontman James
Murphy came from a prolific
DJ’ing career in New York
and his background is seen
heavily in LCD’s discography.
