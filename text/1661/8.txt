efore anyone comes at me
with their perceived positives
of TasteImperial, I'll have you
know that you have been utterly
deceived. Commonfolk may
be misguided by their SCR
breakfasts or the library café 'food'. But
I will dispel these myths them with one
simple example: The Granola Yoghurt.
In simpler times, AKA a few months ago,
there was a product known as the Straw-
berry Compote and Muesli Greek Yoghurt.
I chanced upon it as I was searching for a
healthier alternative to my daily snacking
routine of indulging in chocolate-based
items from the vending machines. The
slightly tangy Greek yoghurt was accen-
tuated by the mellow sweetness of the
strawberry compote and was elevated
by the heartiness of the muesli. It seemed
natural. Whole. Complete. It was the pinna-
cle of breakfast foods. A champion of late
afternoon snacks. A perfect dairy delicacy.
But now I look around and I see their num-
bers dwindling. Like baby tigers, the hubris
of humanity has inadvertently begun the
process of eradicating this gift from nature.
Instead, we are offered a joke of a replace-
ment. The granola yogurt.
At first I was shocked. I love cherries.
But I hate anything cherry flavoured, as
it would always have the sickly chemical
taste that reminds you of terrible, bed-rid-
den sick days of childhood. The days where
you couldn’t go to school, but you were too
sick to do anything fun at home. Instead
you stared at the ceiling for hours and ate
tasteless porridge, and the only flavour
\\ One subtle, yet
horrendously apparent detail
ruined my entire experience:
the raisins \\
you experienced in that day
was the horrid fake cherry
flavoured cough syrup which
made you gag and feel even
worse than before.
Sure, the change in texture
was welcomed, and I grew
accustomed to the “black
cherry” flavour after a while.
But one subtle, yet horren-
dously apparent detail ruined
my entire experience: the rai-
sins. The raisins were the only
sources of natural flavours
within the item. They could
have gone on out of two ways
with the raisin count: Either
use large amounts of raisins to
enhance the flavour profile of
the bland yoghurt, or use no
raisins at all to embrace the
sad chemical flavour. How-
ever, they chose the worst
possibility of all – they added
an average of about two rai-
sins per container. Each raisin
teased your taste buds with a
faint pure sweetness, yet was
never enough to satisfy your
cravings. Thus, you are left
with pure sadness and dissat-
isfaction after the consumption
of this trash.
Do not trust Taste Imperial.
First they came for the Straw-
berry Compote and Muesli
Greek Yoghurt, but you did not
speak out – because you don’t
like yoghurt…
R
aisins – also
known as dried
grapes – represent
everything wrong
with our civilisation
and they seek to
disrupt the foundations upon
which this very nation stands,
and this ingrate, Mr Ma, has
the audacity to suggest that we
need more raisins in Imperial
in order to make his breakfast
better. It makes me sick. I
will be honest with you, dear
readers, that I voted to remain
in the EU referendum, but if
Brexit means breakfast, and
hence means less of this raisin
loving coming to this country to
dilute British culture (I bet half
the raisins you eat aren't even
grown in the UK), then hand
me a copy of the Daily Mail.
The word ‘raisin’ comes from
the latin ‘racemus’ meaning
a bunch of grapes, further
corrupted by old French
to mean grape. Let me tell
you, I will be damned if I put
anything remotely French
in my mouth. Why can’t we
use English words for English
fruit? If you ask me this is a
Hong Kong conspiracy to
manipulate the FTSE 100 by
flooding it with raisin stocks,
\\ Removing the raisin
component allows the
customer to loosen
their gag reflex and
down the contents \\
thus making the pound even weaker. Trust
me Don I have seen this all before – do
you think that I don’t remember the Polish
grapefruit conspiracy of 1998?
From a purely food-based viewpoint, why
you would want to put dry wrinkled balls of
fruit into your mouth is beyond me. Imperial
have spotted the fact that having to chew
these raisins whilst ingesting the yogurt is an
extremely inefficient way of consuming cal-
ories. By removing this component, it allows
the customer to loosen their gag reflex and
down the contents, thus enabling you to
start working yourself to death so that Impe-
rial can receive more grants and president
Gast can line the coffers of the trustees.
Finally I would like to share with you a
personal story. Although your view may
be pro-raisin, I have a deep and personal
vendetta against these wrinkly foes. It was
1942. I was in a Siberian gulag, perse-
cuted for crimes I did not commit. I made
friends with a raisin there named Vanya.
We became very close; some might say
even loved each other. Together we plot-
ted to escape; however, at the final moment
Vanya alerted the guards of my intentions,
distracting them from his escape, and forc-
ing me to spend four more years alone in
that wretched hole. Never trust a raisin.
Never.
There's no place
at Imperial for
elitist 'secret'
clubs
Andrew Olson thinks it's time the
exclusive drinking societies were held
to the same standard as everyone else
E
veryone studying at
Imperial is aware
that this place is not
perfect. Yes, there
are problems with
student engagement,
mental health, even sexism.
But despite these issues, I
feel it is the place which has
mainly contributed at making
me who I am today; the
fantastic wardening team
in my halls in first year, the
challenging environment and,
more importantly, the Imperial
community of incredibly
interesting people from all
over the world which I could
always learn something from.
Because of this mental image
that I had of Imperial and the
Union, I was rather surprised
when I learnt about the Tie
Clubs. It all started last year,
when I was asked as CGCU
President to obtain some
information about our Tie
Club, The Links. I emailed a
few alumni regarding this, and
got very vague responses.
This led to snarky remarks in
subsequent alumni meetings,
as well as a sense that I was
not welcome any more. It
was very obvious I had asked
the wrong questions. But you
might be asking yourself:
what exactly is a Tie Club?
I’ll summarise it for you: there
are three Tie Clubs: The 22s,
\\ You might be asking
yourself: what exactly is a tie
club? \\
The Chaps and The Links,
dominated by rugby players
from the different Constituent
Unions. Invite-only, The 22s
don’t admit women, and The
Links have been accused of
tokenism as even though they
do admit women they only
have one female member that
I know of. They meet in the
Union bar to drink, and are
known as probably the best
example of 'lad culture' (They
literally started as boys-only
clubs) at Imperial. Another
club, The 15s, was founded
last year as a female version
of the 22s, but there is not
much information about their
activities as they don’t seem to
be as active as the older Tie
Clubs. How can we reconcile
the image of Imperial College
as an open, international
university where you are
judged not on the colour or
your skin or your gender,
but on your performance
and ability, with secret invite-
only societies where (mostly)
privately educated white men
meet to drink? We can’t forget
that these societies act as
very effective alumni groups,
giving easier access to jobs
to their members, already
benefiting a privileged class.
If you disagree then you don't
understand the concept of
networking. I am not against
freedom of association. I
believe that if a group of
men want to meet and help
each other out in their own
time, they can do that even
if I don’t agree with it. What
is worrying, though, is when
these organisations have deep
connections with powerful
entities including Imperial
College Union, which could
allow them to bend rules . In
this context it is important to
\\ 40% of the
sabbatical team in
the Union this year
are members of Tie
Clubs \\
remember that 40% of the
sabbatical team in the Union
this year are members of Tie
Clubs, and the next DPFS,
Matthew Blackett, can be seen
in the picture from the Results
Party sporting his 22s tie. This
representation in the hierarchy
of the Union has traditionally
allowed them to dominate
the conversation and deflect
criticism, as can be seen by
the utter lack of response
after this issue was raised last
year at Union Council. The
current status quo legitimises
these organisations and in
turn this means the Union is
condoning their activities. If
any other club were known
for being rude to bar staff,
being loud, and receiving
constant allegations of sexism,
they would be investigated by
the Union. Even worse, if an
external organisation had the
same reputation and history
of discrimination they would
not be allowed to use Union
resources. The exception
\\ If any other club

always seems to be the Tie
Clubs.Withallthisinformation,
it is important to ask ourselves,
why are they even there? Why
does the Union make mention
of them in their policies as an
exception? Why are they not
held to the same standards
as any club, society, project
or external organisation?
The wider student body don’t
know about them, the bar staff
hate working when they are
around, and the people who
do know about them think
they are outdated. Tie Clubs
might have been an accurate
representation of Imperial
College in the 70s (remember,
women weren’t allowed in
the Union bar until 1975),
but they are definitely not a
representation of the Imperial
that I know. Yes, if you don’t
know about them they
probably don’t affect you. But
in this day and age of fake
news, increasing nationalism,
an uptick in xenophobia and
the general apathy of our
generation, it’s important to
stand for what is right. This is
a matter of principle: ensuring
that the body that is meant to
represent all of us, the Union,
actually does so, instead of
representing the interests of a
few.
