The Switch made
the news for its
innovation but is
it any good? Cale

its performance

While the Switch works
well in what I like to call
‘tear-and-share’ mode, the
most exciting showcase of the
devices abilities so far is a sin-
gleplayer game. The Legend
of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
is a masterpiece on many
levels. Its vast, gorgeous open

after unboxing my

was to lick the game

Bomb discovered their bitter
aftertaste. However, the taste
serves a purpose beyond
internet virality: Nintendo

even Wii U. The console looks
and feels like a device built
for adults (unless you buy the
garish neon colour option).
Nintendo advertise it as
something that works at home
or on the go, fitting into your
busy lifestyle but offering
something more substantial
than their previous handheld
offerings. However, its large
size means it’s a bit awkward
to play on public transport.
When you’re somewhere
a bit more stable, standing
the device up and removing
the left and right control-
lers reveals the console’s
most promising feature:
two-player multiplayer out-
of-the-box. Best demoed
with the cooperative puzzler
Snipperclips, handing half
of a controller to a friends
is incredibly satisfying and
quintessentially Nintendo.
Putting the controllers back
into place makes a loud
physical, digital, click noise,
giving the player the sense
that they are constructing and
reconstructing the console.
Like Lego, but for adults.
The Wii brought the family
together in a way games had
never done before, and now
the Switch does the same
for you and a friend. It feels
like the realisation of a vision
that has informed the design
of all of Nintendo’s previous
consoles; the device is an
amalgamation of past design
decisions, sculpted into a
world runs almost effortlessly
on the Switch whether in port-
able or docked mode. Like
the Wii before it, the Switch
supports motion controls.
Zelda uses these, for the most
part, to great effect, allowing
you finer control over aiming
and puzzle segments. After
more than 20 hours with the
game, it is already one of
the greatest games I have
ever played, and the Switch
makes it better. I can play it
anywhere: on my TV, on the
sofa, on the tube, or in bed
and the experience is always
the same.
Other than Zelda, I’ve
played a number of indie
games on the device. Games
that would once have been
only available on PC or PS4
now work just as well, without
any extra development, in
portable mode. The Switch
seems like the perfect console
for indie games so it’s not
surprising that Nintendo
are making an effort to
collaborate with independent
developers to help them port
their games to the device.
The launch line-up might look

way to the eShop.
As a Nintendo fan, I was
always going to like the
Switch. However, it does have
problems. The controllers
occasionally disconnect,
the screen is made of an
easily scratchable plastic (a
screen protector is abso-
lutely necessary), and it still
uses friend codes to connect
players online. Despite this,
it’s undoubtedly the greatest
console Nintendo have ever
released – it just needs more
games.
