reedom is the greatest
quality that us white
people have protectively
possessed for many
centuries now. However,
there is currently a
subclass of people who wish
to take this from us, and in fact
they try every few decades or
so. No, I’m not talking about
the Jews for once, but instead
the problem is the uncle tom’s of
the white educated liberals. The
worst culprits are of course the
women who apparently go to
universities now. The other day
when I was in Starbucks (because
you must always support Israel)
and some unemployed artist told
me that I had misgendered her.
I’m sorry, but are you a woman?
Then you are a woman. Are you
paid consistently less than your
male counterparts? Then you are
a woman. I threw the coffee in
her face and told her to check her
privilege. After that encounter I
left and went to collect my dry
cleaning; however, this landwhale
in front of me was moving at a rate
slower than the investigation into
the disappearance of Madeleine
McCann.
I hence addressed the fact that
this human-elephant hybrid was
taking up the entire pavement by
addressing it in whale song and
promptly telling them to move
their obese excuse for a body. In
response to my polite ejaculation,
the fatty started to make incoher-
ent noises towards me – it’s mouth
was obviously full of biscuits so
I can’t say for certain – but I’m
fairly sure it tried to insinuate that
I shouldn’t fat shame. Now this
is a term that really gets into my
urethra. If you’re fat, don’t try and
make me feel bad for the fact you
can’t stop shoving ice cream down
your gullet. I made my feelings
clear to it, but instead it threw its
diet coke can at me and started to
chase me before realizing that it
would be too exhausting an action
to walk a few metres for its weak
frame to handle.
After that was done, I could
finally complete my art project that
I have recently just started, under
the guise of being into multicultur-
alism. After a poor experience on
going to Golders Green and find-
ing no gold whatsoever, I thought I
should alert other people as to the
true contents of this borough. I also
have made sure that people are
aware of fat old women, a trifecta
of awful people that you should
hope to avoid.
F
reedom is this week’s
theme for the last outpost
of liberalism and free
speech that is felix.
Luckily last week the
artist formally known
as Jonathan Masters lost the
election in order to become head
self-congratulator – also known
as ‘editor’ – and hence balance
has been restored to the universe.
I hear that he is now putting up
‘beware of the Jew’ signs in north
London as an ironic joke. Sounds
hilarious. As a plus, we are now
very close to the end of lent, and
whilst I only subscribe to religions
from South-East Asia, I found
it an extremely opportune time
to give up some of my vices. A
common gripe that many of the
heathens have against vegans
is that we express the truth too
often, which may push us towards
being somewhat abrasive. As a
result I spent the past month and
a bit trying to restrain myself from
telling anyone I was a vegan
unnecessarily and I AM ALMOST
AT FUCKING BURSTING POINT.
*Deep breath*
Anyway back to my favourite
subject: freedom. Obviously it is
tenet of modern western civilisa-
tions that there is no oppression of
any kind towards any individuals;
however, this does not seem to
stretch towards anim– wait. I
stopped myself. Um what’s another
issue I can piggyback onto? Well
I guess we should have freedom
to be whatever gender (from a
choice of 36) we want to be as
long as anim– ok look I just want
lent to fucking end so I can talk
about animals again. During this
period of strife and woe I went to
see Moonlight again, just to rub
it in the faces of all white people
everywhere that felt joy over Ryan
Gosling saving jazz. Here’s one
thing I want to discuss in order
to get my mind off animals of all
persuasions: have you ever seen
a handjob scene in a movie that
wasn’t awkward to watch? There
are three handjob scenes I can
think of: the pilot episode of Break-
ing Bad, Brokeback Mountain, and
obviously Moonlight. I just don’t
get it though – why has nobody
made an arousing/not-uncomfort-
able handjob scene yet? If you
can think of any please send them
in. It’s just like two actors ruffling
around each other’s clothes for a
few minutes. Maybe the solution
would be if they had like a stunt
penis so that it looked more realis-
tic. Or at least like a cumshot that
lands directly onto the camera.
Please don’t steal my ideas.
I’m doing lent so can’t
talk about animals but
can we address movie
handjobs for a sec?
Jonathan Masters’ has an idea
that will revolutionise cinema
Are white liberals
everywhere
nowadays or is it
my neighbourhood?
Monathan Jasters can’t seem to
be able to go anywhere without
bumping into/against annoying
liberals v
