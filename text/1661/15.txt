Has voracious commercialism taken over a traditional expression of property rights? Theo Farah
ventures into the heart of matrimonial hype to learn more about creating the perfect day.
A
s I walked
along
Hammersmith
Road to the
convention
centre,
Kensington Olympia, a
faltering bundle of nerves, I
scanned my brain for excuses
not to enter the palatial
structure. Fortified by a
cocktail of stimulants, I still felt
lacking in brass for my foray
behind enemy lines. Twenty-
one and male, I had been
doubly inoculated from the
mysterious world of weddings.
My only experiences were
the odd episode of Bridezilla
or Cake Boss, highlight reels
of caricatures resplendent in
editor’s face, and pulled by
the allure of the promised
free champagne, I adopted a
regal expression – “They’re
expecting me inside, would
you like me to call the press
office?”
“Just go on in, mate,” he
said, already disinterested
and turning away.
Ecstatic with my success, I
grinned to myself as I listed
all the events I could bluff my
way into with a laminated
pass and a firm handshake.
A whole world of free events
and alcohol lay ahead. Then
I recalled I was about to walk
into the National Wedding
Show and my mood came
crashing back down.
I navigated my way to the
press office and secured my
official laminated press pass.
I began pinning it to my shirt.
“You don’t need to actually
wear it, love,” smiled the
coquettish girl on the desk.
I blushed as I fumbled with
the pin and it fell to the floor,
any illusion of professionalism
irreparably shattered. Her
smile widened as she bent to
pick it up and kindly fixed it in
place for me. I mumbled some
thanks, before fleeing the
scene to begin my first circuit
of the stalls.
I snaked my way around
the centre: an orgy of ivory,
here both as a vendor and
with fiancé in tow. She said
she’d been to over 180 wed-
dings, yet couldn’t possibly
plan her own. I glanced at the
adjacent stall, a luxury Har-
rods spa day for the bridal
party, and wondered if they
squeezed that in between the
ceremony and the reception.
“What makes the perfect
wedding?”, I asked.
“The best was one of the
first I went to,” she began, “it
was officiated at a registry
office, then they went to the
pub, the dress was from New
Look,” she smiled fondly.
“And your own?”
Her face changed, a wild
look creeping in from the
corner of her eyes – “Oh I
don’t know, there’s just so
much to choose from!”
I backed away slowly,
making sure to maintain eye
contact, thanked her for her
time, and wished her the best
of life’s fortunes.
Continuing my circuit, I
passed a rentable ice cream
truck, a rather jolly singer
belting out covers of Adele,
and a gentleman wandering
the centre in a tux minus
the trousers and shoes.
Momentarily, my eye was
caught by a classic Mercedes
convertible in black. I was
accosted by the vendor
– “You missed all of the
beautiful models come in at
twelve,” he leered and began
his spiel. Bored, I cast my eye
over the area, the “Grooms
Room”, complete with bottles
of gin, a pool table, and
handmade leather shoes from
Hungary. Disappointed in
myself for succumbing to such
heteronormative marketing,
I started towards the shoes.
Made vulnerable by the glori-
ous footwear, I was assaulted
by the salesman’s pitch there
too and handed what felt like
my fiftieth business card of
the day. I disengaged and
pointedly emptied my pockets
of business cards in the bin a
metre away. Satisfied with my
display of passive aggression,
I decided I’d seen enough
of weddings. That is until I’m
eventually roped into attend-
ing one.

deviation from plan on their
special day.
I nodded to the secu-
rity guard at the industry
entrance, hoping my hastily
ironed shirt and spectacles
would appear journalistic
enough to forgo investigation.
“Alright, fella?” he nodded
back. I stammered that I was
here as press - “Where’s your
pass, then?”. I informed him
that I didn’t have one. Sneer-
ing, he huffed “Haven’t got
one, eh?”.
Fallen at the first hurdle,
a day without a wedding
convention, however would
I manage?! Imagining the
disappointed look on my
powder pink, starry eyed
brides to be, and infinitely
resigned mothers. As I
wended my way through, I
looked for a kindly, yet bored
salesperson to give me some
dirt on the debacle. I tried to
rehearse how the interview
would go in my head, hoping

to move from bland ques-

itself to the worst excesses
of weddings. I settled on a
stall occupied by a friendly
looking blonde woman
surrounded by images of the
big day occupying all sizes of
frames. “I suppose these must
be your doing?” I jeered,
attempting to regain some
composure after my earlier
humiliation. She told me
about how it was her first time
at the convention, but was
