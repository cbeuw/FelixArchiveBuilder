inally, the last issue (of term). I have been
waiting for this moment for too long. While I’m
going to miss putting together this wonderful
publication for the next few weeks, I’ll be
honest with you, I’m super excited to lay back
and relax, maybe get a massage, definitely
re-balance my sleep and my diet, and just recharge,
because at the moment I’m running on a near-empty
gas tank you guys. I’m literally out of ideas.
It probably hasn’t helped that this week saw us
putting together not only your (high) standard felix,
but also an extra week’s worth of work, as we put
together Phoenix, our annual (though sometimes
termly depending on the mood and our finances)
arts magazine. Next week you’ll be getting some of
that arty sweetness instead of your typical content.
Student prose, poetry, photography, and other fine
arts coupled with some fine design and illustration,
packaged up by yours truly to deliver a sweet arty
punch right where you didn’t know you needed it.
Also we revamped our annual Sex Survey which
we’re launching today hint-hint (felixonline.co.uk/go/
callmedaddy (I’m noteven kidding)). Yes, much like
many editors before me, I can’t wait to add to the
wealth of knowledge on who’s doing what, with who,
and where and why, to put it simply (if not eloquently).
The more of you that do it (the survey, not the sex) the
more we’ll know about how Imperial students do it (the
sex not the survey). So, don’t be shy, log on and show
us who’s really the boss in your inappropriately sexual
relationship with your supervisor.
This is the last issue of term, so in an unprecedented
move we’ve even got some content that won’t be
relevant until next week! Our news and comment are
literally so fresh they’re about to jump out of the paper
and back… into… the sea? Does this analogy work?
Are strawberries berries? Do I care? The answer to all
these questions is the same.
So yeah, I’m keeping it short and sweet.
Enjoy your break. Lef out.
