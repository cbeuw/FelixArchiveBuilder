contemporary Tehran.
The Salesman follows Emad
(Shahab Hosseini), a liter-
ature teacher, and his wife
Rana (Taraneh Alidooti) as
they are forced from their
home by construction
damage. Involved in an
am-dram production
of Arthur Miller’s
Death of a Sales-
man, the couple’s
friend and fellow
actor Babak
(Babak Karimi)
offers a new flat
for them to rent
temporarily. Rana
is soon assaulted
in this new home,
and we watch as the
resolve, push her boundaries,
and then falter is similarly
heart rending, like watching
a friend try and fail to break
free from their problems. This
is only strengthened when jux-
taposed with the challenges
presented to supporting
characters: a single mother
directing the play, elderly
women fearful of strange
men, and old Babak showing
that even when a landlord
is a friend they can still be
arseholes.
Whilst we see the traumatic
effects upon a wide range
of characters involved with
the assault, The Salesman is
equally keen on exposing our

Farhadi has a keen eye for
how fear and frustration over-
spill into different aspects of
our lives, provoking outbursts
incomprehensible to those
ignorant of the full story – we
see Emad’s pupils’ shocked
as their once calm and com-
posed teacher turns tense and
aggressive.
Art-house films tend to have
a predilection for a certain
kind of distraught face; the
sort where the character
looks irretrievably buffeted by
the unfairness and cruelty of
fate. As Emad, Hosseini uses
it to deliver a tour de force
performance. His frown lines
deepen and his eyes look lost
as he struggles to resolve the
rifts and wounds plaguing
his personal life. Yet Hosseini
is convincing, keeping you
fearful for his well-being, as
he oscillates between barely
coping and spoiling for a
fight. Taraneh Alidooti is
similarly effective as Rana,
affecting a vulnerability after
the attack; she’s a character
trapped by her own mind,
unable to break out from
her new-found world of fear.

hink of the worst
thing you’ve seen
a cowboy builder
do. Is it bodging a
driveway? Building

How about undermining
the foundations of an entire
apartment block, causing a
mass exodus of tenants and
starting a chain of events that
drives sharp rifts between
families and friends? So
begins The Salesman, Oscar-
winner Asghar Farhadi’s
latest film. Here, the Iranian
filmmaker brings a tightly
spun drama to the table,

fear of public humiliation.
This is done most notably
through Rana, but mirrored
throughout the film as various
characters find themselves
helpless, unwilling or unable
to seek help or protec-
tion from the more
powerful for fear of
ridicule and the loss
of love and respect.
It is the range of
manifestations of
this powerlessness,
and the variety of
responses to them,
that drives The
Salesman, creating
a riveting tension as
you fearfully watch the
fateful decisions being
made.
