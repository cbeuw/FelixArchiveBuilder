Another key goal of the

I
mperial College Business
School appointed a new
Dean this week, Professor
Francisco Veloso. Veloso
takes on the position in
August after a year of
temporary leadership from
Professor Nelson Phillips,
who held the role of Acting
Dean after the previous
Dean (Professor G. ‘Anand’
Anandalingam) stepped down
last summer.
Prior to his appointment,
Veloso was Dean at the
Católica Lisbon School of
Business and Economics,
Portugal’s leading business
school, since 2012.
Imperial College
released a statement on
Monday announcing the
appointment of the “leading
authority in Innovation and
Entrepreneurship, whose
research has focussed on how
firms and regions develop
and leverage science and
technology for economic
growth”.
His work has included studies
into the development of Silicon
Valley and into the innovation
and scientific impact of
developing nations. Veloso
also holds a position within
Carnegie Mellon University
in the US, a position that the
College statement points out is
an “adjunct appointment” (i.e.
one which is secondary to his
role at Imperial).
This place within the
US university allowed a
partnership between Carnegie
Mellon and Católica Lisbon
to flourish, one which led to
dual PhD programs between
Carnegie Mellon and several
Portuguese universities.
Whether this could happen at
Imperial remains to be seen.
Imperial’s Provost, Professor
James Stirling, said:
“Francisco’s commitment
to academic excellence,
innovation and a global
outlook make him the ideal
person to head Imperial
College Business School
through its next stages of
aspiration and growth.
“His extraordinary
leadership at Católica Lisbon
saw the school flourish into
an institution that is respected
across Europe.”
Professor Veloso himself
said: “I am truly honoured
with this appointment and
delighted to join such a world-
class institution. Imperial
College Business School
has achieved so much in its
short history and is uniquely
positioned for the future.
The growing importance of
technology-driven innovation
and entrepreneurship across
all business areas and fields is
creating opportunities that fall
squarely into the School and
College strengths.”
Professor Veloso has
an undergrad in Physics
Engineering, a PhD from
MIT, and an Alfred P.

as one of 64 institutions
to receive up to £50,000
of HEFCE Catalyst
funding from the Student
Safeguarding fund. This
is part of the £2.45 million
released by HEFCE for projects
addressing sexual harassment
on campus following the
report from Universities UK’s
Harassment Taskforce on
the need for universities and
colleges to do more to tackle
the problem.
The funding has been
released to develop and
implement approaches to
prevent and address sexual
harassment and violence
in universities and further
education colleges. Projects
were selected based on a
range of criteria including
their ability to deliver key
activities and partnerships
with students’ unions and
develop excellent transferable
good practice for the benefit
of students and institutions
across higher education.
Other criteria for the
projects included the ability
to develop the ‘bystander’
initiative, which trains staff
and students in preventing
or reducing violence against
women and hate crimes,

The report goes on to make
recommendations for both
universities and Universities

activities and how universities
can respond to issues more
effectively.
In the words of Emily-
Jane Cramphorn, this new
funding means that “Starting

will involve the development
of a sexual violence liaison
officer network, training of
student-facing staff to handle
disclosure appropriately and
active bystander workshops

groups such as Hall Seniors
and bar staff.”
After some unexpectedly
negative responses to the

student support will be
stronger for this new initiative.
