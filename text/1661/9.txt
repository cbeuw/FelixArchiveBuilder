off of speed
dial. It turns
out that human
saliva contains
a compound –
called opiorphin – which
is six times more powerful
than morphine.
This compound is not itself
an opiod, so it doesn’t act
in exactly the same way
as morphine. However,
it chemically inhibits a
number of enzymes in the
body which are responsi-
ble for the breakdown of
enkephalins. Enkephalins
are compounds very simi-
lar to morphine which are
released as part of the
body’s natural response to
pain and block the trans-
mission of pain signals to
the brain. Thus, a build up
these compounds, driven
by the action of opiorphin,
has a similar effect to that
of morphine.
General consensus is that
opiorphin is unlikely to
be important in blocking
pain in normal life, since
pain is an essential danger
signal for the body. But that
doesn’t stop us using it at
higher concentrations as
a new pain management
therapy, or as an excuse to
pull five times in one night.

T
oday’s port of
call is a French
poires au chocolat
clafoutis. In other
words, what I made
last Sunday. As a
food and science writer I find
tremendous reconciliation
in the overlap between
food, psychology, and
science. I thought it would,
or could, be relevant to
extend my habitual weekend
kitchen shenanigans to this
small space, elaborating
more on the nutritional
or psychological benefits
of specific components.
Of course this all seems
completely contrary to the
philosophy of food– why
break the beautiful mess, the
necessary indulgence of food,
into numbers and statistics?
That’s like tossing great big
assegais into the hearts and
souls of the whole Masterchef
panel. Anyway, nutritional
components interact with
each other in entirely different
ways than they do when
you isolate them in a lab to
analyse. Dessert is dessert,
and that is that. Well, that’s
what most think. No one
would blink at the chance to
analyse something like the
picture below. You see, you
appreciate, you eat. And so
be it, let there be bliss with
such oblivion. As stated in
my previous article, there’s
nothing wrong with letting
go and just meditating on
the smells and complexity of
food. It’s true that curiosity
killed the cat, but we’re at
Imperial, and we want to
know things, right?
Cooking bends the world to
our will. I’m not a good cook,
but I do love to bake, and call
me what you will, but there
does exist some fine overlap
between the two. Each
weekend I never set out to
attain the acme of nutritional
perfection with my experi-
ments, all I know is that I tend
to vacillate between wanting
the simple and complex.
Why talk about just flavour
when you can understand the
nutritional complexity behind
each daring ingredient combi-
nation, and why some always
work?
It’s not wrong to try and
justify whatever pre or mis-
conception you have about
any fruit-based dessert. Heck,
it’s not so wrong to appre-
ciate the little bit of health
stuffed into a dessert without
any fruit, anyway. Pears are
actually also incredibly high
in quercetin, known to boost
overall brain health and
memory, with a recent study
in Sciencedaily showing it
could be part of the ideal diet
to treat and reverse diabetes,
as well as diabetes-induced
hypertension. Naturally
occurring phenolic com-
pounds found in fruits may
provide a variety of health
benefits, though don’t you
dare throw away that peel,
for its varied and higher phe-
nolic content is found in the
skin of the pear rather than in
the flesh or pulp. Anyway, the
study showed that Starkrim-
son (a pear species) peel had
the highest total phenolic con-
tent, and that peel extracts
had significantly higher total
phenolic content than pulp.
What else could possibly
have quercetin?
Chocolate. Of course choc-
olate, dark and nothing more
pretentious than that, bears
all the goods. In my recipe
for this clafoutis, pockets of
chocolate are packed in moist
flesh. Once out of the oven,
the oozing and seeping is
magnificent, luscious dark
rivers seeping into surround-
ing holes and crevices.
Chocolate has plenty, choc-
olate is lush. No, eating this
dessert won’t immediately
improve your brain function
by reducing oxidative stress
and inflammation. Eating a
pear alone, not baked and
overly sweetened alongside
all the hoo-ha, will obviously
be better. Chocolate and
pear is a classic mash-up, and
the additional banana here
adds a moist, sweet dimen-
sion without being too easily
detected. The banana thing
was unintentional by the way;
I just have a tendency to sub-
stitute banana for egg when
I run out of the latter. Not
that the sweet and familiar
flavour doesn’t pair well, but
the mildest hint enhances and
doesn’t shadow the two stars.
The clafoutis itself retained
a lovely almost pudding-like
consistency in the middle,
flying the flan flag high and
bright. Served with the simple
integrity of vanilla ice cream,
this is the perfect breakfast,
dessert, or in-betweener.
All that said, just knowing
about what’s in your food
makes you feel like you’re
eating something special,
honing your experience and
appreciation of the plate. Try
pairing your next pear with
some chocolate for a more
rounded snack satiation and
double the dose of flavonoids
like quercetin. Sadly, I can’t
say much about the ice
cream.
