Two of London’s universities
go head to head in an all-
day battle for glory on the
small screens

more victories and it was
rumoured that in the upcom-
ing match of Counter-Strike,
the UCL team were going
to dominate. It was a long
wait for the computers to get
running properly for CS:GO
but once they were up and
running, the games began.
The Imperial team were
actually able to hold their
ground and were consistently
F
or most people, the
12th
of March was just
another Sunday. For
a group of certain
individuals, however,
it was a chance for
lasting and eternal glory.
Well, more like temporary
happiness for a few days, but
hey, we all have to take what
at Meltdown, a well known
eSports bar in London, which
conveniently has all the setup
and equipment needed for
a big tournament. Despite
the small scale nature of the
event, at least 80 people
showed up, either to compete
or cheer their friends on.
Before the games could
begin however, there were a
multitude of server and other
technical issues that needed
addressing. If you try and
organise any games tourna-
ment, that’s just a given thing
you need to deal with. It took
a while but they were finally
sorted out and the games
could begin, albeit slightly
delayed.
The games played were
Starcraft, Hearthstone,
Defence of the Ancients,
Counter-Strike and League
of Legends. The overall gist
was that the University that
won the most games would
be crowned the victor. Simple
enough, and Imperial College
was able to win the Starcraft
match with relative ease
(dat library broadband). It
seemed as though the DOTA
match would follow suit as
Imperial were able to achieve
an impressive win for the first
match. However, their streak
didn’t last for DOTA and UCL
were able to inch ahead and
win the DOTA game.
Hearthstone was next, a
freemium and highly addictive
online card game that anyone
can play. This time the match
was very, very close and it
went all the way down to the
last game where, unfortu-
nately for us, UCL were able
to steal the victory.
As the day gave way to the
night, things started looking
grim for Imperial; UCL had
ahead of UCL; in fact they
won the first set of matches.
In the second set, UCL started
to gain the upper hand but
Imperial refused to go down
and were able to get in some
wins. Eventually, even though
UCL won the second match,
Imperial managed to snatch
enough victories overall that,
to everyone’s surprise they
were declared the victors of
the Counter-Strike varsity.
Almost poetically, it came
down to a classic game,
League of Legends, to deter-
mine the ultimate winner of
the tournament. Things had
to be set up quickly as it
was late in the night by then
and Meltdown was to close
in a few hours. The League
matches began with intense
action right from the start and
overhead commentary added
to the mood and atmosphere.
It was brutal and tense but
eventually, the Imperial team
were able to plough ahead
and win the match, and
the tournament. So we are
literally better than UCL. Fuck
you QS rankings.
But are we though? Accord-
ing to reports, the UCL team
had technical issues with their
headsets so they couldn’t
properly communicate and
work together. In light of
this, a rematch of League of
Legends will be held for fun
on the 8th
of April, which you
can live stream from Impe-
rial Esports’ twitch stream
account. So look out for that
for that final confrontation.
Overall, the tournament
was a massive success and a
great way of bringing people
together for games, drinks
and banter. Another one
is planned for next year so
hopefully this will become a
regular thing and get bigger
and better with each repeat.

This Sunday, an eSports
tournament was held between
talented players from Impe-
rial College and UCL. Five
games, two universities but
only one trophy to be claimed
by the ultimate winner. The
trophy was big enough that I
could hold it in the palm of my
hand; a clear indication of the
fact that the organisers went
all out on this tournament.
Speaking of organisers, this
tournament wasn’t organised
by any large groups like
Varsity Games, but rather by
the eSports societies of both
universities. It was also held

A final round of congratula-

eSports societies and the
players for their efforts and
victories.

Yakuza 0
Talk to the racecar, the face ain’t listening
\\ Sega

T
he Yakuza games
have always been
immensely popular
in Japan, so much
so that their central
protagonist, Kiryu
Kazuma, is considered
a mascot of PlayStation.
However, they unfortunately
have never found their footing
here in the West and are
largely unheard of. If, like
me, you have never played a
Yakuza game before, please
right that wrong by playing
this game.
Yakuza 0 is a tale centred
around two protagonists
and acts as a prequel to
the other games. Kazuma
Kiryu, the protagonist of the
entire franchise, is a brash
and naïve young man who
recently joined the yakuza.
In a simple money collection
mission gone wrong, he is
framed for murder and ends
up embroiled in a massive turf
war between parties that seek
to take over Tokyo. Mean-
while, Goro Majima, another
mainstay in the franchise, is
a one-eyed ex-Yakuza living
in Osaka as the manager
of a cabaret, as punishment
for a crime he committed.
To gain favour with his boss,
he agrees to assassinate a
person named Makoto Maki-
mura, though his life takes
slow but powerful Beast style.
Majima on the other hand,
has his typical Thug style, a
break dancing Breaker style
as well as a bat-wielding Slug-
ger style. Each style for each
character shines in specific
circumstances; for instance,
Kiryu’s Rush style is great
for taking on certain large
enemies by darting in, deal-
ing a few hits, then darting
out; while Majima’s Breaker
style in incredibly good for
taking on and demolishing
large crowds of people. There
are no experience points,
as everything in the game
revolves around a single cur-
rency: Yen. The same money
that you use for buying items
and everything else is also
used for upgrading your skills
and abilities, which leads to
interesting decisions about
which abilities to upgrade
early in the game. However,
soon the money begins flow-
ing in, making most decisions
trivial.
However, playing through
the story is just scratching the
surface of Yakuza 0. The side
missions are among the best
parts of the game, though
they will initially throw play-
ers for a loop. This is because
there exists a massive tonal
change between the main
story and substories; you
can go from an incredibly
emotional scene involving a
surprising reveal to a wacky
substory within minutes. One
of my favourites involves a
person you meet in a dark
a sharp turn when he finds
himself unable and unwilling
to do so.
These stories are gripping
and extremely well told,
despite some melodrama.
However, this is easily over-
looked as the performances

are phenomenal; the voice
acting, completely in Japa-
nese, is incredibly good and
is able to sell the weaker
parts of the story. There
are instances of surprising
emotional depth; for instance,
my sister came in to watch a
section of the game for the
first time just as an important
cutscene was playing. Fifteen
minute later, she was in tears
and completely hooked. The
game benefits greatly from
focusing exclusively on the
plights of Kiryu and Majima,
with the paths of both protag-
onists ultimately converging.
The gameplay is simple,
and the beat-‘em-up combat
is brutal yet fun. Each pro-
tagonist has three distinct
fighting styles, which can
be switched on the fly and
can be upgraded individu-
ally. Kiryu has his standard
Brawler style, a quick and
nimble Rush style as well as a

alley selling mushrooms. You
assume he is selling magic
mushrooms but he is in fact
just selling normal mush-
rooms. Whenever you visit
him, he is constantly being
accosted by yakuza who want
magic mushrooms, much to
his bewilderment. Another of
my favourites tasks you with
helping an American popstar
called ‘Miracle Johnson’
shoot a music video involving
zombies, while in yet another
you stand in as a producer for
a TV advert. These substories
are incredibly entertaining
and once you accept the wild-
ness, you are in for a massive
treat as they provide the most
amusing parts of the entire
game.
Yakuza 0 is truly amaz-
ing, and with the release of
Yakuza Kiwami, the remake
of the first game, soon, there
has been no better time to
jump into this franchise. This
is a great entry point and
it proves that even with an
inconsistent tone, a game can
deliver a fantastic experience.
You owe it to yourself to give
Yakuza 0 a try, as it is one of
the best games this year.
