Practice room due to re-open (maybe)
The due date has already been pushed back two months
Lef Apostolakis
construction went ahead.
“I didn’t feel qualified/
competent to argue with
acousticians,” says Hunter.
The completion of the works
only confirmed the student
advisors’ fears. “There were
plenty of mistakes which would
be apparent to an acoustician
(flanking paths built, big holes
through the ceiling, etc.) but
nobody picked up on that,”
adds Hunter.
The result? Inadequate
facilities, which needed
a follow-up repair visit
reportedly costing an
additional £20,000. The
follow up work didn’t improve
isolation. According to a
Sandy Brown report, “It is
considered that the sound
insulation performance is
unlikely to have significantly
increased” and in fact
it appears to have been
reduced by 8dB according to
a May 2015 report, making
J&R practice louder to the
bedrooms above than it
must have been before the
changes.
Up until last year, the Union,
College and the contractors
have been constantly locked
in endless backs and forths.
However, last term, Union
President, Nas Andriopoulos,
confirmed that works would
be taking place to rectify
the situation. Whether the

refurbishment which has seen
numerous student media
facilities intermittently being
cordoned off over the course
of the last few years. This last
leg of the works should mark
the end of a cumulative £1.27
million investment.
If all goes according to
plan, next term should most
importantly see the reopening
of the Jazz & Rock (J&R)
practice room which has been
closed for over a year now as a
result of poor soundproofing.
The J&R room was originally
delivered back to students in
2014, after a major overhaul
of the West Basement that cost
about £1 million. The project
was a result of Imperial
College’s accommodation
expansion into Beit’s East
Basement, which was
previously a Union space
used by student groups. The
East Basement hosted, among
other things, the Chaplaincy
(which has been temporarily
moved to Princes Gardens). In
exchange for the lost space,
College financed a state-of-
the-art media redevelopment.
The Union invested an
additional £100,000 in
equipment.
However, almost
immediately after the delivery
of the West Basement back to
the students, the poor quality
of the works became evident.
The main issue was and still
is soundproofing. Inadequate
vertical soundproofing
has lead to the raising of
complaints from residents
in Beit and the subsequent
limitation of practice hours
to 11pm at first, then 9pm,
then 7pm and eventually the
complete shutdown of the
space. Similarly inadequate
horizontal soundproofing
has meant that J&R use has
been disruptive to IC Radio’s
broadcasting as well as ICTV
activities in the neighbouring
shared studio. The poor
construction is not limited to
the J&R room, but affects other
spaces as well, as became
widely apparent during the
2016 Meet the Candidates
Broadcast (the pundits in the
supposedly isolated radio
suite could be heard through
to the shared studio where
the candidates were being
interviewed).
In the original report
produced by Max Hunter,
a then student who’d
been heavily involved in
Imperial Student Media, the
recommendation is for the
J&R room to be specifically
“designed by acousticians and
soundproofed to high grade
(particularly to avoid spill onto
Beit Quad, and across the rest
of the media basement.”
Despite the report’s
recommendations (and
inclusion of suggested
acousticians) College
decided to go ahead with
Sandy Brown, who might
be a large and reputable
firm, but mainly specialise in
educational consultancy for
the construction of lecture
theatres.
The Sandy Brown consultants
reportedly advised that
the soundproofing values
requested by the students
are for professional studios
and it would be very difficult
and costly to achieve such
levels of isolation in the West
Basement. In fact it would
require building a room inside
a room.
The counter proposal was
to follow current acoustic
performance standards
for schools widely used to
set acoustic performance
standards in other educational
buildings. Despite Hunter and
others at the time noticing
oddities and potential errors
in the report, their objections
were unreported and the

remains unconfirmed, though
a Union source heavily
implied they did. Regardless,
Andriopoulos’ work in
securing funds has been
invaluable. As current chair
of the Club told felix “Nas has
done a terrific job at making
things actually happen.”
It should be noted that this
year’s works have reportedly
cost an additional £50,000
and have in turn met a
series of delays. Though
they were originally meant
to be undertaken over the
winter break and completed
by the start of spring term,
construction workers told felix
that the works have suffered
delays due to unpredictable
issues such as the need to
reroute heating pipes, the
discovery of “mystery pipes”
which weren’t in the the
original building plans and
a near flood among other
things.
These complications, as well
as the need to limit working
hours to minimise disruption,
have caused the move of some
students staying in the rooms
directly above the space, as
well the pushing back of the
delivery date; first to February,
then to March, and now April.
When students will reclaim
the J&R room remains to be
seen.
issue of Tie Clubs has been
raised at Council according to
Olson. However, he said that
previous attempts to discuss
the Union’s affiliation to these
Clubs have been almost
immediately terminated as a
result of Tie Club pressures.
Olson told felix that he had
been tasked by Council to find
out whether the Links Club
accepted women in their ranks
(The 22s notoriously don’t),
as there was no mention in
their online resources. “After
sending a one-line email to a
member of the CGCA (CGCU
alumni association) I received
snarky remarks from different
alumni in the subsequent
alumni meetings. After this, it
was extremely difficult for me
to contact them and to try to
organise events with them.”
Trying to look into Tie Club
Your new sabbs are here
You can forget about elections for the rest of the year
Joanna Wormald
felix after being involved
in the paper for the past
five years. He has pledged
to protect felix from Union
interference, encourage
more student involvement,
develop our digital strategy,
and enhance collaboration
with other societies. A focus
on investigative journalism
will also help us to hold the
College, Union, and new
sabbs to account.
So you’ve done your civic
duty (or at least 6704 of you
did) and it’s over. With that,
you can stop caring (or, more
accurately, pretending to
care) about elections. At least
for a few months.
F
ollowing a 36.79%
turnout (down a bit
from last year but
still the third-highest
in the country
according to the
Union website), elections are
finally over and winners have
been announced.
As previously reported,
out of the 21 candidates
standing for sabbatical
positions, only 13 were ever
serious contenders. Of the five
candidates running for Union
President, only one submitted
a manifesto and headshot. It’s
hardly surprising then that this
position went to Alex Chippy
Compton. Having spent the
past year as ICSMSU President
and previously held more than
a dozen positions on society
committees, she certainly
appears to have the practical
understanding required to
enact her campaign pledges.
Running a clear and concise
campaign (the three key points
of which handily spelled out
his name), your new Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies)
is Thomas Bacarese-Hamilton.
One of four medics elected to
a sabbatical position, Thomas
has promised to provide better
training for volunteers and
improve the transparency and
management of societies.
Nicholas Burstow also
favoured a three-point plan.
The aims of the newly elected
Deputy President (Education)
can be essentially summarised
as a desire to increase
communication between
students and staff— something
he already has experience
with in his role as the current
ICSM Academic Affairs
Officer.
Hoping to collaborate with
Nick is Fintan O’Connor,
the new Deputy President
(Welfare). The two positions
are “inextricably linked” and
cover areas such as student
support and better access to
personal tutors, which Fintan
described in his manifesto as
“a lucky dip”. His remit will
also include important issues
such as mental health and
sexual assault and consent. As
CGCU Welfare Officer, Fintan
has worked closely with the
current DP (Welfare) so is a
promising pick for next year.
Meanwhile, the position of
Deputy President (Finance &
Services) goes to Matthew
Blackett. This is a seemingly
apt choice given his studies
at the Business School and
various “positions of financial
responsibility”. Promises of
pre-poured pints probably
didn’t do him any harm either.
Finally, next year sees Fred
Fyles ascend from Culture
Editor to Editor-in-Chief at
A
paper is to be
presented at
next week’s
C o u n c i l
meeting asking
the Union to
stop handing out tankards to
the so-called ‘Tie Clubs’. These
are invite-only ‘secret’ clubs,
members of which can be
easily identified on a night out
as they adorn characteristic
ties.
The paper presented by
Andrew Olson, ordinary
Council member, argues
that Tie Clubs do not meet
the standards of the Union’s
Equality of Opportunities
Policy, namely, fostering
”an environment free of
unfair discrimination and
harassment”. Therefore,
according to the policy, they
should be suspended and not
granted “the use of Union
resources and facilities”
The paper aims at the
removal of the tankards of
The 22 Club, The Chaps Club
and The Links Club, at least
until they “provide sufficient
evidence that they comply
with the Equal Opportunities
Policy to the satisfaction of
Union Council”.
This may mean the clubs
would have to provide
detailed information on their
current student members’
demographic, including
race, gender and social
background. It is also likely
that complying with an
Equality of Opportunities
Policy would translate into
abandoning the “invite-only”
member’s policy that many of
these Clubs adopt.
This is not the first time the
culture can also prove tricky
when a large percentage of
sabbatical officers are also
members of these clubs. For
example, Nas Andriopoulos,
current Union President, is
a member of the 22s, as is
next year’s Deputy President
(Finance and Services),
Matt Blackett. This year’s
Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies), James Cox
is reportedly a 22 and was
initiated right before he was
elected, during the election
results last year.
In response to felix’s enquiry
the Union said: “The tie clubs
are not affiliated to Imperial
College Union and we do
not fund, support, govern
or administrate them in any
way; their policies are their
responsibility.”
We also approached the
\\ Out of the 21
candidates standing

positions, only

‘Drinking societies’ face tankard ban
Lef Apsotolakis
Chaps Chair George Warner.
According to Warner, the
club has always “had a
policy of promoting student
and alumni involvement within
Imperial College, especially
the RSM.
“As of last year we
introduced our first female
member, after a vote including
student and alumni members.
This is not ‘tokenism’, but a
genuine effort to change, as
such the club has been inviting
female members of the RSM
to Chaps events for the last
three years in a bid change
general opinion of the club
towards being all-inclusive.
For the avoidance of doubt,
we do not discriminate on any
characteristic.”
Whether the Tie Clubs will
successfully refute Olson’s
Claims remains to be seen.
