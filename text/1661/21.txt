Imperial Bursary
If your family’s household income has changed you can be
reassessed during the academic year by the Student Finance
England (or equivalent awarding body).
You need to ask for a current year income assessment which
will assess your household’s current financial situation. You
may be entitled to a larger loan for living costs from the
Student Loans Company and larger Imperial Bursary.
Once you have been assessed you must get in touch with the
Student Financial Support Team before 1 May 2017 to be
reassessed for your Imperial Bursary.
