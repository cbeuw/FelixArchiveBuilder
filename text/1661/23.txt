This week Imperial
finally becomes ‘cool’
enough that it gets
its own resident drug
dealer. As it’s Imperial
though, they only
sell Modafinil and
Adderall and frequent
the library rather than
Metric.

This week you’re the
weather, and you’re
actually alright. Go
you.
This week you’re the
Union mascot, Mike,
the 75kg micrometer.
You yearn to be
violsted like the other
mascots, to bask in the
sun and be ransomed
for booze. #FreeMike
This week you
win/lose in the
Leadership Elections.
In the grand scheme of
things it doesn’t matter.
This week your
landlord pays you a
surprise visit. You panic
and decide to put all
the rubbish in your
wardrobe. Except you
can’t because it got
smashed last week at
your house party.
This week you’re the
Sherfield walkway
notice board. For
two weeks you
were looked at and
admired, now you go
back to being merely
glanced at. Story of
your life.
This week you’re over
two weeks into Lent and
you’ve not gone back on
your promise! It’s a shame
that the thing you gave up
was attending lectures.
This week you call
a referendum. You
saw Scotland doing
it and figured it’s the
thing to do nowadays.
You’re unprepared and
nobody knows what
they’re actually voting
on. You’ll fit in fine.
This week you’re
invited into the secret
West Basement tie club.
Sure, the others may
control all the high
flying position in the
Union, but we’ve got
control of the press.
And all the shiny iMacs.
This week you give
up all hope and
decide to join the dark
side. You sell your
soul but it’s all in vain.
You’re a biologist and
even Shell can’t find a
use for you.
This week you fill in
the felix sex survey. Use
whatever you haven’t done
as a sexual to-do list and
be sure to keep us updated
at union.president@
ic.ac.uk. Pictures heartily
encouraged.
This week you’re at
the end of your group
project. Ten of you
started off, happy and
sane. Nine survived.
One perished.
(Though they really
fucking deserved that
bludgeoning to be fair)
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m writing to you because of the imminent Spring break
that’s about to happen. Put plainly, I don’t want it to happen!
I don’t want to go back home. I enjoy my independence in
student halls (even if it’s Alban). I like my new friends here,
and we’ve already formed a tight D&D group.
Imperial is the bombDOTcomSLASHorgATtumblrTM. I can
actually plays sports here and people think I’m good and no
one has made fun of my clarinet yet. Except Garry. Fuck you
Garry.
So yeah you catch my drift. Don’t want to go home. How
do I deal with this.
Best,
Joe, a humble fresher
Dear Joe,
You’re so sweet and young and innocent I
literally just want to put you in a box, and
lock that box in a cupboard, in a safe, room,
hidden behind my bedroom wall, to protect
you from all that is evil in the world, but most
importantly at Imperial.
Either that or you’re the most boring human
being in existence.
Either way here’s the deal: You need to leave.
Firstly, to understand that Imperial is not what
the real world looks like. Secondly, to actually
take a break and make sure you don’t burn-
out. I don’t know what nancy-pansy course
you’re on (probably Biology) but if you’re not
feeling the heat yet... you’re probably going to
HOROSCOPES
be feeling it real soon.
In some ways Imperial is like ancient Pompeii.
(they were both cutting edge and sexist at the
same time but that’s not my point). The place
to be and yet the place you don’t want to stay
too long in.
Seriously though, go away. If you don’t want
to go home just like interail or something. You
can even try travelling alone. It’s a thing. Enjoy
telling people you go to Imperial and witness-
ing complete indifference in response.
So yeah, fuck off. It’s what’s best for you.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
