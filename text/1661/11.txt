T
he UK’s first
major exhibition
of modern and
contemporary
American
printmaking, that
has recently opened at the
British Museum, spans twelve
rooms and six decades. The
American Dream: pop to the
present is as ambitious as it
is controversial, with critics
questioning not only pop art’s
artistic value, but moreover
whether it belongs in the
British Museum at all.
The exhibition, however,
aims to prove that printmak-
ing was a key technique
through which artists tackled
the changing social and
political dynamics occurring
during their lifetimes. By
presenting different artists
coveted 'American dream'
as an illusion. By using
screenprinting techniques, for
example, these artists blur
the lines between commercial
and fine art.
Many works are of giant
scale, reflecting the notion
propagated by consumer-
ism that 'bigger is better'.
Similarly, a recurring theme
between different artists is the
display of common everyday
objects. By displaying these
objects as icons, the artists
ridicule the idealisation of,
and obsession with, the
stereotypical American way
of life, which dominated mass
advertising and bordered on
a social cult.
The exhibition also allows us
to learn about the printmak-
ing process itself, spotlighting
innovative techniques that
were experimented with by
pioneer artists of the 1960s
and 70s. Some surprising
methods include Ed Ruscha’s
use of gunpowder to achieve
grey notes, and dropping
lithographic ink onto stone
to give the illusion of liquid
letters, as well as Donald
Sultan’s aquatint, which
replicates charcoal drawings.
Common also are techniques
of exhaustive reproduc-
tion – collaging, layering,
producing, and reproducing,
over and over again. These
processes appear to mirror
those associated with mass
production, exposing how
such a means of production
rids objects of their value.
The British Museum is home
to many artefacts of lost
civilizations, and one can
argue that some of the works
in this show belong to that col-
lection, as relics of America’s
lost glory days – the tattered
American flags of Jasper
Johns’ Flags 1, for example,
or Robert Rauschenberg’s
pieces that reference the
space race.
The contrast between New
York and Los Angeles artists,
as highlighted in one of the
rooms, is quite unexpected.
Works of LA artists make
statements pertinent to the
'LA lifestyle' and the world of
leisure with recurring motifs
of palm trees, sunlit boule-
vards, Hollywood, desert
landscapes, and light blue
pools. The objects associated
with leisure in these artworks
seem to radiate the still hot
LA air, and, paradoxically, a
feeling of dead, uninhabited
emptiness.
Worth noting as well is the
importance of words and
phrases in contemporary
American printmaking – a
subject which is unique to
this art form. Works in this

and works in chronological

each decade’s prominent art
movements such as abstract

reflected, and was integral to,
each of these movements.
“Everybody has their own
America, and then they
have the pieces of a fantasy
America that they think is
out there…”. Andy War-
hol’s quote opens the show,
alongside a giant American
flag made of neon lights, and
these set the mood for the
exhibition: the idea that print-
making exposed this 'fantasy
America', which had been
accepted and endorsed by
society, resonates throughout
the show.
In the first room, one
instantly recognizes iconic
works by pop artists such
as Andy Warhol and Roy
Lichtenstein. It’s remarkable
how cleverly and clearly their
works make statements about
American consumerism and
mass media, revealing the

show by artists such as Mel
Bochner, Ed Ruscha, and
Bruce Nauman display either
single words or every-day
clichés, giving them an
ironic tone that is enduringly
thought-provoking.
Overall, the British
Museum’s show proves that
printmaking is not only a
prominent art form, but is
also a versatile technique
full of endless possibilities; a
medium that one can make
one’s own. This inclusive
art form is open to all as a
powerful means of expressing
one’s voice and beliefs.
These aspects not only justify
printmaking’s artistic merit
and historical relevance, but
moreover – with the aura
of general discontent with
current political and social
issues that seems to permeate
through today’s world – print-
making seems as relevant in
our age as ever.

C
lassical dance
is about
confirmation,
while
contemporary
dance is about
exploration.” Classical ballets
are drawn from well-known
tales; the characters fall
into easily recognisable
roles – the princess, the
knight-errant, the evil queen.
By the end of the first act,
if not before, we all know
how the story ends. Good
triumphs over evil, the star-
crossed lovers are tragically
separated by fate, and so on.
Even the language of ballet
displays itself in conventional
figures such as grand jetés
and pirouettes. On the
other hand, contemporary
dance is characterised by
freedom and creativity of
movement, with a focus
on expressiveness – unlike
classical dance, there is often
no narrative story and the
abstract meaning of a piece
is left up to the viewer to
decide.
Personally, I find the neb-
ulous-ness of contemporary
dance a bit confusing. It was
thus, with some trepidation,
that I attended Returning/To
Be Me, a double bill which is
Liverpudlian Julie Cunning-
ham’s choreography debut at
the Barbican. After a success-
ful career as a dancer,
including a decade

ningham – one of
the forerunners

– she is trying
her hand at

own dance
company,
consisting of
just three other
dancers and
herself.
Gender fluidity
and identity is the
theme of the evening.
The first piece, Returning, is
set to an eclectic soundtrack
of Anohni, Björk, and Ravel.

androgynous costumes, the

collection Hold Your Own.
The poems are based loosely
on Tiresias, the gender-chang-
ing prophet of Greek legend.
Tempest is known for her
spoken-word poetry that
draws from rap and hip-hop
influences, and her wild voice
provides a perfect backdrop
for the starker, more forceful
choreography of To Be Me.
Compared to the shifting flu-
idity of Returning, this second
piece is moodier, darker, with
themes of internal conflict and
external struggle.
Cunningham’s classical
training is evident in her
meticulous choreography.
While it retains the formalism
and structure of classical
ballet, it uses it in a highly
explorative, experimental
way. The four dancers fill the
performance space and the
choreography is never boring
or monotonous to watch.
Purely from a dance
perspective, I don’t think
I liked it that much – Cun-
ningham’s choreography
is certainly solid but it is
not very accessible. One
enigmatic configuration of
figures morphs to another
with impassioned staring
and quasi-symbolic gestures,
but a coherence within each
piece is somewhat lacking
and the inherent meaning
(is there meant to be one?)
remains elusive. In 1903,
Isadora Duncan proposed
that for the dancer of
the future, “the natural
language of the soul
will have become
the movement of the
body”. Perhaps it is
just me, but I don’t
think contemporary
dance is quite there
yet. Combined with
the poetry and music,
however, Cunning-
ham’s choreography
does make an interest-
ing piece of performance
art. Thought-provoking,
even if the theme of gender
starts to feel a little overdone
by the end.
