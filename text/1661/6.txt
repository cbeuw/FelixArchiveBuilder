So you want to
run an Elections
2018 campaign?
Alexandre Adler advises you on how to
win an election – warning: it involves a
lot of human interaction

for a position
in the student
elections is the
least Imperial-like
thing imaginable:
you have to talk to strangers
while sober. Some coped by
campaigning online, thereby
retreating safely behind a
Facebook page or Twitter
account dedicated to their
glory, but most of us ended
up doing the face to face
campaign. And it was an
interesting experience, so I
chose to write it down for your
convenience. This way you can
feel the thrill of the elections
without actually standing for
anything, or even voting. Isn’t
that great?
The first step happens before
campaigning: choosing what
you stand for. Not in the “I
have values” kind of way, but
in the “I have ambition” kind
of way. You won’t get elected
if you stand for everything, so
think hard about the position

amount of outrage

not too much or
you will sound petty
and short-tempered

you aim for. Next year’s
#Medictatorship is a perfect
example, with three out of
five sabbs hailing from the
department of medicine after
Chippy Compton-scattered
any serious candidates across
all the positions. This way,
instead of having to compete
against each other, they
cruised peacefully to victory
almost unopposed, in one of
the most boring elections in
recent memory. So choose
something just slightly above
what you are currently doing,
like dep rep from year rep,
or CU president from CU
officer. The Union sends you
an email suggesting what
you can stand for, but I feel
their targeting is a bit off, as
they suggested I stand for
an undergrad position (I’m a
postgrad) and DP Education (I
like my course).
The next step is writing your
manifesto. Here, you need to
convey just the right amount
of outrage to seem bold, but
not too much or you will sound
petty and short-tempered
(#Corbyn). Be sure to highlight
your current experience,
while remaining silent on how
grossly you underperformed
in carrying out your own
expectations. You still
probably did more than the
person before you though, so
don’t feel ashamed of listing
your triumphs, no matter how
small. Add a few promises
where you extrapolate what
you feel is lacking and must be
fixed to the whole college, and
voilà! Manifesto magnifico.
But a manifesto is only the
second most important part
of your election profile. The
picture is where you need
your A-game. Use one that
is slightly better looking than
you are, but not so much
that you wouldn’t recognise
yourself. Avoid adding extra
stuff in Photoshop unless you
are Fred Fyles, in which case
go full Soviet imagery on us,
since felix is a Lef-tist bastion.
Outdoor backgrounds are
good, since they tell people
viewing the picture that you
have interests beyond the food
at Fusion. You can also add
a PDF with more campaign
promises or posters, but
nobody is going to actually
read it, so the image is really
the only visual stimulation
voters will get.
All this needs to happen
before you can start
campaigning. You then have
two weeks ahead of you to
rack in more votes than your
opponents, or congratulate
yourself if nobody ran against
you. I had the luck of having
two serious opponents, so
you get to read a few more
paragraphs of my delicate
prose.
Your campaign starts with
buying Blu-tack. Otherwise
you end up with a pile of
posters and no way to actually
put them up on the Sherfield
walkway before it gets
covered in reams of campaign
material. A good campaigning
poster has your face, your
name, the position you’re
running for, a nice sentence or
two on what you stand for (the
values part this time), and the
official “Leadership Elections”
logo on it. This year’s cringiest
poster slogan was “Just
another supporting character
in the inspiring story of your
life”, so you have a low bar to
clear.
This should be done by the
Wednesday before voting
opens. Afterwards, you
campaign physically. I am
sure you have interacted with
a campaigner during this
election season, as they often
come and address lecture
theatres or hand out flyers. So
instead of telling you what I
did, I will tell you how it felt.
This was the most terrifying
public speech I had made,
and I had peddled pseudo-
science to 600 people before
that (tickets for this year’s
Bahfest are selling out! Grab
them while you can!) because
this time, it’s about you, about
convincing other people you
are worthy of their trust as a
person. As a postgrad, I also
went to the labs to interact
with PhD students, and it is the
same gut-wrenching, palm-
sweating, shoulder-shaking
experience when doing it
one-on-one. And you do it
day after day, each time as
nervous as the time before,
until voting finally closes on
Friday. Often, you will come
out as less eloquent than you
wished, or fail to convince
someone to vote (particularly
postgrads who feel that the
Union does nothing for them).
But it doesn’t matter: you are
roleplaying another person,
one that is smarter and more
social than you, and it’s fun.
That’s right: the terror of
speaking to strangers blurs
into the joy of expressing
yourself somewhere during
the conversation. When the
results came in, I was happy
to have won, but that joy was
nothing compared to how
I felt each time I convinced
someone to vote.
So if you are here next time
around, run or campaign: it is
probably the most interesting
experience you will have at
Imperial.
