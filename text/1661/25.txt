A
nother early
rise and
long journey
was made
bearable by
company.
American football at Imperial
is played in one club and with
one team. It is a close-knit and
friendly environment, where
everyone is encouraged to
develop Football skills, and,
most importantly, have fun.
This time our travels took us
to Cardiff, for the Southern
Division One semi-final
against the Cardiff Cobras.
The Cobras had only had one
loss the whole season. They
were primed, ready, with a
full and healthy roster. On
the other hand, we Immortals
were depleted with many
players playing Offence,
Defence and Special Teams.
In warm ups it was evident
that we were the smaller
squad. To be honest this
was an observation made
at all the games this season;
but that never stops us. We
are Southeast Division One
Champions, and undefeated
at home. We are well
coached and have more
quarter. Unfortunately this
turn was not in our favour.
A long bomb by the Cobras’
quarterback was received
and lead to a massive gain
down field. On the day you
could sense the Cobras’ con-
fidence grow and momentum
switch. With this change in
the wind, the Cobras found
themselves in the end zone.
At this point hearts sank and
defence got a second wind.
Cobras slithered through
the Immortals’ (injured and
depleted) offensive line, this
meant that the ball hardly
progressed. A stagnant
offense meant that the defen-
sive spent a lot of time on the
field. The QB of the Cobras
began to hit their stride. Pass
after pass was received and
supplemented by a consistent
the win was not deserved by
the Cobras, or even that the
Cobras did not deserve the
final score. What can be said
is that we, Immortals, did not
deserve that score; it was defi-
nitely not representative of
the hearts the players played
with. At no point did the
squad bend to the will of the
Cobra, and a good fight and
strong spirit was displayed
Jason Patrick Kuilan, Guil-
laume Fontan, David Meine,
Firaz Ahmad, Tanvir Naz-
amuddin, Kem Smooth and
William Ginzo. All these play-
ers have made contributions
to the team, from leading
it as President to devoting
their time to attend training.
Whatever their contribution,
they will always be Immortal.
This has been a great season,
although this game was
perhaps not the best note to
end on, it does not take away
from our achievements. From
relegation from the top tier of
university American football
last year, to division cham-
pions this year; this is a tale
of retribution that only a few
teams at Imperial can match.
Half of the team this year
was made up of rookies.
Some of the rookies had
never heard of American
Football in Britain or even
watched any NFL. Through
the coaching provided these
players are now starters on
the team, and some have
positions on committee.
We are now recruiting for
the 2017/18 season. If you
are interested in playing
a fast-paced hard-hitting
sport, why not give American
Football a go? All expe-
riences, sizes and shapes

our dominance seemed to
fade. The first half ended. A
frustrated Immortals squad
attempted to ready them-
selves for the next half. The
score stood at 7-0 Cobras.
Only one score between us
and the finals.
During the break it was evi-
dent that the long season had
taken its toll. Many players
were playing out of position,
even more playing through
injury. The second half saw a
different picture. The Cobras
run game. It was evident that
the Immortals were playing
their hearts out. For many
player this could be their last
game. Through hit after hit,
play after play, Immortals
tried to stop the advance of
the Cobras but to no avail.
Touchdowns came to the
Cobras one after the other.
The final score at the end of
the game was 27-0 Cobras.
We wish them luck for the
finals.
It would be lying to say that
throughout the game.
When the final whistle blew
a melancholy swept over us.
With this game our season
ended. The playing career of
many Immortals ended too.

heart than any other team
out there; numbers (normally)
don’t matter.
The start of the game was
in our favour. For the first few
drives, the Cobras Offence
made more negative yards
than positive; vintage Immor-
tals defence. A similar story
for offence. Although no
breakout play occurred, the
offense consistently picked
up first downs and had little
trouble advancing the ball.
Initially all was good. The
turning point of the game
came early in the second
