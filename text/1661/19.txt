Spiced rack of lamb with char-grilled, smoked
Lamb season will be starting in a
couple weeks and this means only
one thing – you are allowed to enjoy
a fancy meat you normally ignore
for the easier to cook beef or pork.
Get ready to salivate with this easy to
make lamb delicacy.
B
ack home, lamb
is usually cooked
just as a traditional
Easter dinner.
Otherwise, I don’t
believe we have
lamb at any other point in the
year.
Probably, because of that I
am quite reticent about cook-
ing it – that and the fact that
I hate my mom’s lamb. Mom,
I love you, but you have no
idea how to prepare lamb.
But, a couple of weeks ago, it
was my best friend’s birthday
and we decided to organise
a little dinner for him and,
long story short, we decided
that lamb is something you
cannot go wrong with,
especially because it’s his
favourite food. And our little
experiment turned out quite a
success, in the end.
While getting ready to
prepare this delicious meal,
keep in mind that it’s enough
for quite a lot of people –
depending on how hungry
they are, four or even six.
So you shouldn’t make it too
spicy or too anything in fact
because, you know, not every-
one has the same preference
as you do.
Or, maybe, everyone likes
it a bit spicier than you do
and you don’t want to ruin
everybody’s meal because
you are a weakling. This dish
is very good exactly because
it is spicy enough and some-
what sweet. Just like you after
you’ve had mexican.
Ingredients
For the marinade
1 ½ tsp cumin seeds (yes, I know
that some while ago I said I hate
them, but in some dishes they are
just right and yes, you can totally
judge me)
½ tsp fennel seeds
¼ tsp caraway seeds
3 tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves, peeled
1 ½ tsp fresh root ginger
1-2 mild chillies
1 ½ tsp ground coriander
1/8 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp salt
1 tsp tomato paste
1 ½ tbsp lemon juice (preferably
freshly squeezed)
2 tsp granulated sugar
Cayenne pepper
For the lamb
800g rack of lamb
1 tsp olive oil
Optional, if you want to serve it
in order to impress people: get
some salad leaves for plating
For the aubergine dip
2 aubergines
1 tsp lemon juice (again, use
your just acquired skill for
making it)
For the marinade preheat
a frying pan and toast the
cumin, fennel and caraway
seeds for a few minutes. My
editor-in-chief went into a
tangent about how easy it
is to over-roast seeds and
burn them and how that can
really ruin a good curry, and
how he learned this from his
Shrilankan bestie but I will
not do the same thing to you
and bore you for a good ten
minutes. Besides this isn’t a
curry. This part is followed by
something trickier: you then
are supposed to crush the
toasted seeds into a relatively
fine powder. If you have a
food processor, then it’s easy-
peasy! If not, you will have
to get a bit creative – not
dangerously creative, like
dropping a bowling ball on
them from a ‘safe’ height.
Mix the powder with the
other marinade ingredients
until the mixture becomes a
fairly smooth paste. Though
I could mention the quantity
of cayenne pepper you add,
it’s really entirely up to you.
You know how much spice
you can handle. If not, take a
guess and may the force be
with you!
Place three quarters of
the marinade and the lamb
racks in a Ziplock bag and
refrigerate for at least five
hours. I recommend letting
them sit overnight – I know,
no student is able to plan
their meals in advance, but if
you’re goinmg to cook then at
least cook them properly. You
are on the path of becoming
a chef – just in case you fail
your exams and subsequently
your chance in academia and
a better life – so better act
like one!
For the aubergine dip (side
note: you’d be doing this
the following day), wash the
aubergines and let them dry.
Over an open flame – and
totally ignoring the no fire
rule of the college – or over a
Bunsen burner when no one is
looking, roast the skins of the
aubergines until they blacken.
Leave to cool.
Take the lamb out of the
fridge and let it rest until it
reaches room temperature.
Preheat the oven at 200º C.
Sear the lamb in the olive
oil. Make sure all sides are
equally done. Try not to over-
cook it however. Wrap the
racks in aluminium foil and
place in the oven for 10-15
minutes.
Let the meat rest before
carving it. You should let it
rest for at least half the time
you cooked it, while making
sure it doesn’t get cold.
Take the aubergines and
remove the blackened skin.
Mash the flesh with a fork
and add the remaining mar-
inade and the lemon juice.
Mix until smooth. Transfer into
a serving bowl – or you know
what, you can just serve it in
the same bowl you’ve pre-
pared it and enjoy the feeling
of having less dishes to wash
up. I know you will.
I hope you will find time to
cook this mouthwatering dish
between all the last-minute
assignments you’ve been
postponing since forever.
Enjoy your holiday and
your mom’s home-cooked
food while you can (unless
she can’t cook and you only
takeaway when you go
home). And, in case you don’t
hear from me in time for your
exams next term, good luck
with them. Don’t fuck them up.
You’re not a chef quite yet.
