Imperial divestment campaign revived
But will it succeed where the last one failed?

representing around 400
institutions and huge
numbers of individual
investors (including
Leonardo DiCaprio). Just
a year and a half later,
another 300 institutions
haveannounceddivestment
commitments, and the total
funds divested have more
than doubled to $5.46
trillion. Divest Imperial
campaigners hope that
they can capitalise on
this trend to push for
divestment at Imperial.
T
his Monday will see
the relaunch of the
fossil fuel divestment
campaign at
Imperial. The new
campaign will
be called Divest Imperial,
and at the official Launch
Party on Monday evening
campaigners are hoping to
convince students that the
recent successes of divestment
groups such as the one based
in King’s, can be replicated at
Imperial.
Many universities, and
other public bodies such
as councils and funding
bodies, have large
investment portfolios
consisting of stocks and
shares in a wide range of
companies. The portfolios
usually serve as an
additional revenue stream
for the university, and
are typically comprised
of shares in a range of
different companies and
sectors. This often includes
large amounts invested
in fossil fuel companies.
Divestment campaigners
argue that by investing
in fossil fuel companies,
universities are tacitly
endorsing their behaviour
and business models.
Imperial’s own
endowment of £126.2
million is used to “deliver
a material and growing
source of unfettered funds
for the academic mission”.
Of this figure, about five
million is directly invested
in fossil fuel companies,
with further investments
in externally managed
funds which may also
contain fossil fuel shares.
Alongside money it
receives for research
funding, this places
Imperial third in the UK for
its financial dependence
on fossil fuel companies,
behind Manchester and
Cambridge.
Fossil fuel divestment
began in the US in 2011,
and 35 US universities have
committed to divest up to
this point in time. Most, such
as Boston University and
Georgetown University,
have divested from fossil
fuels entirely; others
including Yale, Stanford,
and Columbia have begun
by divesting from the most
heavily polluting fuels,
usually coal and tar sands.
The UK, however, is
leading the movement,
with 45 universities – over
a quarter of all universities
in the country – having
announced divestment
proposals following
student pressure. High
profile institutions such as
Edinburgh, Oxford, and
the LSE are among those
committed to divestment,
and a rising divestment
tide in London looks set to
engulf UCL, precipitated
by the successful King’s
divestment campaign.
Globally, the divestment
movement is growing
exponentially. Having
begun with a handful of
college campuses six years
ago, by late 2015 some
$2.6 trillion of investments
had been removed from
fossil fuels companies,
\\ The UK, however,
is leading the
movement, with 45
universities having
