The Advice Centre nees YOU
There’s an opportunity to join the advice team at ICU, to help us better
understand the college and improve the experince of students. The Advice
Centre offers academic and non academic advice to students and it’s an
impartial, independent and confidential service open to all students at Imperial.
The aim of the service is to support students on a 1-2-1 basis, tackle issues on
a wider scale and help improve the college’s procedures and regulations. We
need volunteers to help us understand what problems students have within
the different departments and how these operate. This will help us target
problems more effectively and be more supportive towards students.
Advice volunteers will act as a link between the Advice Centre and the department and will also help us run events more successfully. The role is flexible and
will vary according to your commitment. To express your interest email advice@imperial.ac.uk, briefly describing why you would like to take part. If you have any
questions email Angela Urasala, Advice Centre Manager (a.urasala@imperial.ac.uk). If you have an interest in improving the student experience, do get in touch.
