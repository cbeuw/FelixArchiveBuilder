Banning
religious symbols
is discrimination

ruling by the European Court of
Justice

Dear Mr Trump:
it's time to pick
a fight with
Zuckerberg
Alan Perfect has a suggestion for
Trump's next vendetta
D
ear Mr Trump: It
is well known that
you’re a regular
reader of felix, so
I sincerely hope
you get to read
this.
We all know you don’t like
Silicon Valley. You and Larry
Page are not exactly BFFs. I get
it. Google donated almost half
a million dollars to the Clinton
campaign. California is a sort
of liberal Disneyland. Nobody
likes you there.
You also know how powerful
Silicon Valley has become. I’m
proposing that you do some-
thingthatwillmakebothliberals
and conservatives happy. Yes,
both of them. Not only that, but
by doing what I’m about to tell
you, you’ll come out looking
like a powerful bully not to
be messed with. You’ll love it!
What I’m proposing, as you
might imagine, is that you
break up Facebook. Facebook
is the world’s most powerful
monopoly. There. I said it. It
has a monopoly over a huge
network. Two billion users. It is
\\ acebook being Facebook,
with its monopoly of a net-
work of two billion people, is
arguably the most powerful
company in the world \\
getting more and more difficult
to compete with Facebook on
the same grounds. People don’t
use Facebook because it has a
better user experience. No.
They use it because their family
and friends are on it. I couldn’t
just decide to use a Facebook
competitor, because I need
their network. The 'network
effect' is a 'winner-takes-it-all'
game. If it wasn’t, Google+,
with its better user experience,
would have probably suc-
ceeded. But nobody used it,
because nobody was actually
on Google+ in the first place.
Okay, Mr Trump, you might
now be a bit sceptical of what
I’m saying, because deep
down we all know you’re a
reasonable person (all the
flamboyance and pseudo-rac-
ist populism is just a big act).
You might be thinking that
people choose to be on Face-
book. Nobody makes them.
They could just leave Face-
book now. But the problem is,
they can’t. Imagine AT&T was
the only mobile network pro-
vider in the US that managed
to reach everyone, and there
were other little ones used
by hugely dispersed people
around the country. Imagine
AT&T’s policy was then to only
allow communication with
people also on AT&T. Sure,
they had their merits – building
a whole mobile network is not
easy. But this situation would
be a clear monopoly. It would
be illegal.
So why should the aver-
age American (because you
try to represent the average
American, right?) care? Well,
not only should the average
American care, but so should
you, as president. Especially
you. You see, normally I
wouldn’t be excessively con-
cerned about a company
amassing a great amount of
power. Because companies
respond to shareholders, and
their ultimate goal is to make
money. That keeps them in
check. Large companies are
less scary when you know
what they ultimately want.
But something changed last
month. Most people didn’t
really notice, but Zuckerberg
published a manifesto entitled
“Building a Global Commu-
nity”. Go have a look. It is
extremely political, but in such
a subtle way that Zuckerberg
probably didn’t even notice
himself. Quoting the piece:
“Our greatest opportunities
are now global – like spread-
ing prosperity and freedom,
promoting peace and under-
standing, lifting people out of
poverty, and accelerating sci-
ence. Our greatest challenges
also need global responses –
like ending terrorism, fighting
climate change, and prevent-
ing pandemics. Progress now
requires humanity coming
together not just as cities or
nations, but also as a global
community.” What’s unsettling
about this piece, in a slight but
very clear way, is the tone.
The political tone it reeks of.
And okay, I do have to admit
that I agree with some of the
stuff. Maybe I agree about
this whole idea of going from
nations into a global commu-
nity. But that’s not the problem.
The problem is that this is the
most political statement a com-
pany could ever make. And
Facebook being Facebook,
with its monopoly of a network
of two billion people, is argua-
bly the most powerful company
in the world. The power its
newsfeed has had to slightly
affect our emotions without us
even noticing (we know this
helped you in the election,
Donald) is massive. And Zuck-
erberg is the youngest man in
the top ten Forbes list of bil-
lionaires. There’s bound to be
a point up there where money
doesn’t matter to him anymore.
And Zuckerberg’s got years of
power ahead of him. Just add
to the cocktail all the recent
changes Zuckerberg’s made
to the corporate structure to
have even more control. There
comes a point where too much
power is concentrated.
So, Donald, now that I have
convinced you, how do we pick
a fight with Facebook? The first
thing on the list would be to
introduce a law that prohibit
mergers and acquisitions of
large social networks. No more
Facebooks buying Instagrams.
With this law you can also,
retroactively, make Facebook
spin off both Instagram and
Whatsapp (yes, retroactively:
you’re going to love being
this big, powerful bully). And
finally, you make it compul-
sory for all social networks to
enable network portability,
i.e. being able to move your
list of friends from one social
network to another (which
\\ The 'network
effect' is a winner-
takes-it-all game.

Google+ would
have probably
succeeeded \\
is something Facebook took
advantage of, as you could
from the start import all your
mail contacts, Yahoo contacts
and Twitter contacts to Face-
book, but never the other way
around). This way, you prevent
large monopolies forming, you
enable smaller players to be
able to compete and bring new
ideas. The result? A much more
innovative and decentralised
Silicon Valley.
We all know how much you
love to pick a fight. So here you
go – this is a reasonable but
epic battle to pick.
T
he triple penalty that Muslim
women face – for being a
woman, for being a Muslim
and often for being of an ethnic
minority group – has never been
more prominent. Muslim women
are no longer just at the disadvantage of
being subconsciously seen as inferior to
other candidates for a potential job, but
are now being turned away and even, in
some cases, dismissed from their careers.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has
ruled that companies are entitled to ban
their staff from displaying "any political,
philosophical or religious sign” which
includes (but is not limited to) turbans,
skullcaps and the hijab. However, it must
also be stated that the ECJ also includes
that customers cannot demand a removal
of such religious expressions if the com-
pany itself doesn’t disbar their staff from
doing so. Whilst the latter sounds promis-
ing, it doesn’t negate the fact that the ECJ
have essentially permitted companies to
not only hold but enforce their discrimi-
natory views against any display of faith.
François Fillon, a presidential candidate
of France, claims that this ruling is “a factor
in cohesion and social peace”. However,
whilst it is true that seeing fewer women in
hijab may avoid the discomfort of a few, it
creates mass tension between the Muslim
community and law enforcers. Such unease
between the two communities will ulti-
mately have detrimental effects, creating
disharmony and a lack of faith in the law.
In response to the two publicised cases of
Muslim women being dismissed from their
jobs for refusing to remove their hijab, the
\\ The hijab is pivotal to a
sense of identity to so many of
those who choose to wear it \\
ECJ stated that the ban “does
not constitute direct discrimina-
tion”. I, however, am unable to
consider a case that is more
obviously an example of “direct
discrimination”. Turning any-
body away for the practice of
their faith, especially one that
cannot and will not detriment a
person’s ability to perform in a
role, is a discriminatory act and
should be seen as nothing less.
It is also important to note
that while the hijab, like any
other religious garment, is pri-
marily a religious requirement,
it is also integral to the sense
of identity of so many of those
who choose to wear it. Remov-
ing the ability for anybody to
practise their faith while work-
ing in their preferred profession
is counterproductive to the
social movement of freedom
that is so heavily advertised
with the modern age of the 21st
century. The reality is that we
are starting to skew towards
a society where bigotry is not
only accepted, but is being pre-
sented as justifiable by many
who hold powerful positions.
\\ We are starting

A
s I saw the
headline a
sigh left my
chest. “EU
Wo r k p l a c e
H e a d s c a r f
Ban Can Be Legal”. Contrary
to the title, the law is to be
equally enforced onto all
religious signs, whether it is the
turban, crucifix or skull cap, as
mentioned within the article.
This whole situation is fairly
laughable. They paint these
"religious signs" as disposable
objects carried or worn by
those with religious beliefs. A
headscarf, forming part of my
hijab, isn’t something I put on
in the morning because I’m
having a bad hair day, nor is
it something I take off at the
end of the day because I can
finally be bothered to brush
my hair. It is part of me; it
encompasses the very essence
of my beliefs, without which I
wouldn’t be who I am.
The same applies for
other religious items such as
the dastaar (turban) worn
by Sikhs. Not only does it
portray an image of equality
and respect (amongst many
other things) but makes up a part of their
identity. How is it that, despite our endless
technological advancements, our mindsets
seem to be regressing? As a society,
we’re constantly encouraging children
to develop their own views, opinions,
likes and dislikes – to be unique. But with
policies like these, are we not contradicting
our own teachings? ‘Robotising’ workers
to look a certain way, to act a certain
way, in a desperate attempt to ensure
that we remain within the confines of
what society is comfortable with seeing.

What message are we really sending?
The hijab debate resurfaces every
so often, but why? Women should be
allowed to cover up as much as they
are allowed to show skin, whether it is
for religious reasons or not. How many
times will Muslim women need to repeat
the same arguments before it has any
effect? Especially since my wearing a
headscarf does not impose on anybody
else's rights, beliefs or behaviour. It's just
me doing me. Whilst it is sad that the law
has allowed workplaces to enforce this
law, I have enough faith in organisations,
those deemed 'top employers' at the very
least, to not actively implement it. The
very organisational values of diversity
and inclusion that form the backbones of
most CSR and Careers departments of
most firms can now really be proved or
disproved based on their stances.
