SEX
A beginner’s guide to public sex
S
o, since this is the
last issue before
the Spring break,
and as people
customarily tend
to travel during
breaks, this article is going to
be about taking advantage of
opportunities to have sex in
unusual locations. Of course,
I’m not referring to France
(their love of cheese is not
unusual – just deal with it) or
other travel destinations, but
I’m trying to make a tenuous
link with fucking in weird
places. So, take a break from
revision and prepare to be
entertained.
Let’s start with the basics:
Agoraphilia. The term refers
to a wide range of practices
or fantasies which involve sex
outdoors, sex in wide-open
spaces and sex in public
places. The motivations for
this can be as simple as want-
ing to try something novel,
but sometimes involve much
B.C. Maile
can certainly give a sense of
liberation and excitement. But
breaking the standard rules
of where you can and can’t
have sex also feeds into that
standard sexual mentality of
losing inhibitions. If you grew
up in the countryside, you’ve
probably had an outdoor
encounter at a drunken camp-
out. But if you’re more of a
town mouse, why not have
a trip out of London, find a
quiet forest and give it a go?
Alternatively, you could take
it one step further and have
a go at dogging. Most of you
are probably familiar with
the lingo, but ‘dogging’ is a
sex, although there is some
crossover. The exhibitionists
sometimes enjoy sex as an
act of performance, or enjoy
the feeling of letting go and
going primal, without having
to worry about observers. For
others, there’s a humiliation
aspect to the fetish, in being
publicly dominated. Unfortu-
nately for doggers, dogging
is illegal, and sex in public
can carry a hefty fine.
If you don’t fancy taking
that risk but still want to have
sex in public, some beaches
are sex-friendly. It’s worth
noting though, that most
nudist beaches have a fairly
straight, public sex might be
a bit more difficult to get, but
there are still options. There
are a fair few straight swing-
ers clubs around London – a
few of them quite kinky. A
quick online search (try Fetlife
or just plain ol’ Google)
should yield some good testi-
monials. If you’re a girl, you’ll
potentially getting found
out and the accompanying
feeling of naughtiness are
major drivers. That’s why
some of you will go for
slightly cleaner spaces, such
as various lecture theatres,
Queen’s Tower or the library
(you know who you are). But
still, grime can be part of the
thrill, which is why, time and
time again, some of you’ll
go for the grossness which
accompanies public showers,
toilets and Metric. That very
literal feeling of dirtiness
adds a new layer of taboo
breaking to the experience,
on top of the getting-caught-
with-your pants-down factor.
Whilst it’s not for everyone,
the sport has many followers.
There is a lot of erotic media
revolving around this type of
public sex, and it has become
such a cultural phenomenon
there is even a law in the UK
specifically prohibiting sex in
public bathrooms. So if you’re
going to try it, be very careful
you don’t get caught.
Regardless of whether it’s
the great outdoors, showing
off in public, the risk of being
disturbed or getting down in
dirty places that floats your
boat, embrace it. If you’re
feeling confused or shocked
by this article, or even if
you’re plain-old bored, I hope
you at least feel inquisitive
enough to take advantage of
the break and try something
new. Just be careful, and
remember to always check
for cameras.

more complex desires. One
of the main spheres of moti-
vation for agoraphilia seems
to be based around the open-

to the practice of having sex
in public, usually a car-park
or field, while others watch.
Some practitioners get off
on having people see them
fucking, some get off on
seeing others fucking. The
motivations behind this are
somewhat different from
just being into outdoor
strict no-sex policy. If you
don’t mind being indoors,
there is still a multitude of sex
and swingers’ clubs around
London. If you’re gay, you’re
in luck. London is full of gay
saunas where sex is allowed
and encouraged. There are
also a hell of a lot of gay sex
and kink clubs around, just a
mouse-click away. If you’re

get into most of them for a dis-
count, if not for free. If you’re
a guy, you’ll be paying a fair
bit more. #patriarchy
Though, such spaces can
take away part of the appeal.
For many, it’s really about
the thrill of nearly getting
caught. I’m sure most of you
have heard stories of people
having sex on campus (and
there are, indeed, several
decent spots). If you’ve ever
heard these stories and asked
yourself why people would

basement shower with the
stink of a half-clogged drain
filling their nostrils – well, let
me explain.
We’ve established that
