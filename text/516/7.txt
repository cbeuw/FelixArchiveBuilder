MY SECRET AFFAIR WITH
SUSAN HAMPSHIRE
8 W
STANDBY sees some of the best
shows in London by whizzing along
with his Student Card to the theatre
box office just before the show
starts.
He pays only a fraction of the
normal price for any unsold
seats. But How????
The Society of West End
Theatre (SWET) held a
press conference on
April the 24th to launch
the new scheme which
should introduce more
young people to live
theatre.
This Student Standby
Ticket scheme will operate
at 34 West End shows
unfortunately excluding Evita and
one or two others. The idea is for unsold
seats to be made available to students
shortly before the show starts at a
reduced price. This will be flat for all the
range of seats with the reduction
counted in pounds rather than pence.
Trevor Phillips.
The actual arrangements for any
show are left for the management of
that particular concern to set their
own price etc. This has a big
disadvantage from the students'
point of view since while they'll know
that the scheme is operating, the time
prior to curtain up, when the tickets
become available and the actual
charge is not likely to be published
and could well changefrom one night
to the next.
The scheme is receiving the
support of the National Union
of Students and Trevor Phillips
who has recently been re-
elected President and was at
the conference, remarked that
it was particularly relevant to I.C. "...if
there is any culture at Imperial
College that is!"
Also present, to my suprise and
delight was a star or two including the
delicious Susan Hampshire, Richard
Briers, Bogdan Kominowski, Allan
Love and Denis Quilley who
explained why so many
knee weakening' per-
sonalities were interest-
, ed in student tickets.
Firstly they hate
playing before any
empty seats and
secondly they are
concerned about the
future of theatre and
hope that the scheme
will encourage a younger
audience who will laugh at the
jokes that the older patrons seem to
miss.
The management feel that this idea
will do more for them than just bring in
more revenue because they believe the
Standby audience of today will become
the full paying middle-aged audience o f
tomorrow .
Q u e s t i o n s f r o m the s t u d e n t
journalists seemed to indicate that
the majority were of the opinion that
the scheme did not go far enough. I
agree that there is much room for
improvement but I would remind
everyone that you've got to start
somewhere.
Could the scheme extend to school
children? Should it be nationwide?
These questions seem so far off.
M o r e i m p o r t a n t , " W h a t is a
recognised Student Card?" I was
shocked ... and stunned that the

homework here. They s e e m e d

unsure but Mr. Phillips leapt to their
rescue, " N U S cards, College Student

cards;...they are the main ones." Of
course that list includes our very own
green, plastic colander so we're O K
folks! But just before you all rush off to
the West End check in the evening
newspapers or in Time Out. That fancy
'S' symbol is what to look for.
Happy hunting.
