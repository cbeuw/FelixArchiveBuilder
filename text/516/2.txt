Dear M r Harris - In the light of
c e r t a i n r e m a r k s that have
appeared in F E L I X I feel some
comments must be made, some of
which should have been brought
to the attention of students long
ago.
Personally, when I read Stella
Earnshaws letter I d i d not really
care that y o u h a d closed
correspondence on it. I would
have liked to say something about
the backstreet abortion lie but
otherwise the letter consisted ol
twisting remarks I made to
different meanings a n d personal
attacks on me and Sean. None of
the pro- abortionists had actually
answered any of my points and if
this is the best they can do it shows
they have no concrete arguments
anyway.
I would be interested to see you
actually name the vast number of
alleged people who could not
s t a n d a n o t h e r m e n t i o n o f
abortion in F E L I X who came to
you and asked you to stop it.
Whilst I accept that after six
letters on the topic it could have
become stale to many people I do
not see how you can justify saying
the 'same few' w h o were
discussing it as I was the only
correspondent who wrote more
than one letter o n it (ie 2). Each
week someone different made a
contribution (and I a m sure you
told me 2 women had replied to
Miss Pratts letter but then you
denied it when the next F E L I X
came out).
You are also unjustified by
comparing the issue with the
stand on homosexuality based on
a belief that only a tiny minority
of students have. I have no
particular religious or political
beliefs, and assess the issue as I
assess torture or blackmail,
without reference to any dogma.
M y arguments would apply to
anyone, not just those who believe
the Bible or Das K a p i t a l or
whatever.
I submitted a letter last week
which you refused to print on the
grounds that you had closed
correspondence on the topic. T h e
letter consisted of a number of
humorous extracts from the Bible
about God. H o w you can say you
had closed such correspondence I
fail to understand because -
(i) T h e topic was the Bibles
attitude to homosexuality.
(ii) Y o u had closed correspon-
dence on this topic (ie abortion)
not 'these' topics.
I was very annoyed about this
because I had spent many hours
compiling them, a n d I thought
many non-religious people would
find them amusing.
W h i c h brings me to the
important part of this letter.
Paid sabbaticals, and any other
union officers for that matter,
should be servants of the union,
not masters. Y o u said in your
editorial ( F E L I X 512) there is no
danger of the union taking over
'the newspaper of I C U n i o n ' ,
there will still be 'editorial
freedom' (the editor will still
dictate how the paper is run?). In
the last F E L I X , you say you were
'elected to edit'. I believe these
concepts are correct for an editor
of a commercial newspaper with a
large full-time staff, but for a
paper like F E L I X the editor's
job should be co-ordinating and
making the biggest contribution
to the work involved in producing
the paper. Disputes about what
can be included in the paper
should be settled by a democratic
body such as the new F E L I X
committee, although a U G M
should always be able to overrule
such decisions if necessary. T h e
U n i o n finances it, reads it,
members of the union produce it,
and if it is the newspaper of I C
Union the union should have
ultimate control over it. It should
N O T be controlled by any one
person.
True, what you have said is
what the bye-laws say, but I have
thought the bye-laws were wrong
for a long time. I feel a U G M
should always be able to overrule
a decision ofthe Editor of F E L I X
the same way as it can overrule a
decision of the President or the
Executive. Being able merely to
do the ultimate and sack h i m is
not sufficient. I welcome any
other views on this matter.
I have never tried to do
anything about this because I was
naive enough to think such
disagreements never arose, but
from last week's letter it appears
they can and do. I, personally, feel
you have been reasonably fair on
matters where you may have
some bias eg. you have printed
heavy criticisms of yourself, you
printed in full my very long first
letter on abortion (as I hope you
will this letter). Nevertheless,
dictatorship is always wrong,
even i f it is r e s p o n s i b l e
dictatorship.
Finally, whilst I can see some
sympathy for your need to close
correspondence on abortion, in
view of your refusal to print the
above mentioned letter and other
reports ofthe dictatorial way you
have been running F E L I X
recently I am resigning from my
post of tfic F E L I X committee as
media rep as a small mark of
protest.
B a r r y Austin
Dear Sir, - Y o u r editorial self-
defence in last week's F E L I X
seemed to me to be mis-judged
and ill-researched, not to mention
unfair.
Firstly, the correspondence on
abortion was not between the
'some few' at all. Y o u published
six letters on the subject from five
different c o n t r i b u t o r s ; these
figures speak for themselves.
Secondly, if you felt compelled
to close correspondence, Miss
Earnshaws letter was not the one
suitable in view of its factual
errors, unanswered questions,
serious misrepresentation of the
aims of P A T A and its attacks on
Barry Austin and myself. A brief
perusal of the contents ofthe letter
is sufficient to reveal this fact.
Lastly, plase refrain in future
from needlessly linking abortion
and homosexuality. T h e letter to
which you replied dealt only with
the former.
Yours,
Sean D Kelly
PS - I will discuss the contents of
the aforementioned letter with
Miss Earnshaw or anybody else. I
would hate to start a chain of
c o r r e s p o n d e n c e on e d i t o r i a l
freedom and judgement which
would, no doubt, be just as
unimportant and boring as the
one in question.
Dear Sir, - Last week we
attended, along with thousands of
others, the Festival of M i n d , Body
and Spirit at O l y m p i a . W e
thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, but
were appalled by the large
wastage. M a n y stalls handed out
leaflets to most passers by, even if
they showed no apparent interest
in the subject.
T h e case that shocked us the
most being Friends of the Earth,
who at the same time were selling
recycled paper etc and advising us
to slow down on our consumption
of the world's resources.
T a k i n g the educational aspect
into account, we feel that the
distribution o f a certain number of
leaflets was needed, but that the
stalls concerned could have been
more slective and given the
leaflets only to people who were
doing more than just glancing at
the stall as they wandered past.
