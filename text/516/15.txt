S M O K E FILLS C H E M I S T R Y
Smoke instead of fresh air was
pumped through ventilators in
the old chemistry block when lire
broke out in the ventilation plant
room adjoining the building.
The fire, which occurred
shortly after 2.00pm last Friday,
caused about £400 of damage to
electrical equipment and cables,
when it spread from cardboard
boxes containing air filters stored
in the room.
A member of staff who spotted
the fire called the lire brigade who
quickly extinguished the (lames.
The building was not evacuated.
NEW FIRST FOR W O M E N
For the first time in history a
w o m a n is Head o f a n I C
Department, the Rector told an
audience this week.
She is Professor Dorothy
Wedderburn who became the
first Head of the new Department
of Social and Economic Studies
last October.
O n Tuesday she gave her
inaugural lecture under the title
'Great expectations? - engineer-
ing and society'. The Rector
chaired the meeting.
In her lecture she outlined the
role of the new department. The
emphasis in u n d e r g r a d u a t e
teaching was on interdisciplinary
studies as the department has no
undergraduates of its own.
Research by the department's
academic staff and postgraduates
was concerned with the structure
and processes of decision making
in industrial organisations. They
would also be looking at the
impact of health and safety
programmes in industry, and
s t u d y i n g the Post Office's
industrial democracy experi-
ment. She hoped the department
could make a useful contribution
to the "understanding of the
interplay between engineering
and society.
She continued with an analysis
of the British crisis outlining the
various explanations put forward.
A l l these boiled down to two main
problems, she said. These are the
lack of technological innovation
and bad industrial relations. She
went on to discuss the causes.
LIVE R E C O R D S H O W
I C R a d i o made a novel attempt
to enter the Guinness Book of
Records - and transmitted it live
on Sunday night.
Harvey N a d i n was broadcast-
ing the stations regular live
programme from Stans Bar when
he came up with a new idea in
audience participation. H o w
many people could get into a
Waitrose trolley over a 5m ride?
Thirteen students managed to
pile in but the problem came
when they tried to move forward.
W i t h four people holding the
trolley steady they crawled 2m
whereupon they collapsed in a
heap. O n a second attempt they
found that the trolley was bent
resulting in Harvey broadcasting
an appeal for another trolley.
There is no current record for
this feat. The nearest thing to it is
a record for the number of people
who can stand on a pillar box, set
up by students (who else?) of the
City of L o n d o n College. It stands
at 29.
UNIVERSITY
U N C H A L L E N G E D
Imperial College students will
not be appearing on University
Challenge, the popular television
quiz, this term as the current
series has been cut back. The
team will take part some time
next year.
The four students making up
I C U s team are Andrew Gray
(Biochem PG), Nick Griffin
(Chem E n g 2), D a m i a n Hassan
(Maths 1), and Frank James
( H O S T PG). Bob Hart, who was
originally in the team, has been
dropped because he will not be a
student next year.
IC RADIO T A K E O V E R ?
M a n y of the senior members of
I C R a d i o will be helping to
produce B B C R a d i o London's
M a r a t h o n programme, due to be
broadcast from 6am on Sunday
until 6.30am on Tuesday. The
programme is an attempt on the
British record for the longest radio
programme and is also intended
to raise money for children's
c h a r i t i e s . R a d i o L o n d o n

wave, 94.9 M H z V H F . I C R a d o
station manager, J o h n Allen, told
F E L I X that he thought it 'a great
opportunity for members to get directly-
involved in the activities of a
professional radio station' and he
hoped that it would lead to
further co-operation between the
two stations.
P A R K I N G P E R M I T S
I C U n i o n will be running
a n o t h e r p a r k i n g p e r m i t
competition in J u n e for students
who want to bring their cars to
College in July.
In the past any student could
park in College grounds during
the three summer months without
a permit. This has resulted in
congestion especially in J u l y
w h e n t h e r e a r e s e v e r a l
conferences in College. The new
scheme will attempt to limit the
number of student cars in that
month. N o permits will be
r e q u i r e d for A u g u s t a n d
September.
Students who already have
permits will be able to keep them
in July. The U n i o n will reallocate
permits held by students leaving
at the end of term. U n i o n
Secretary M i k e Elkin will write to
permit holders informing them of
the a r r a n g e m e n t s . S t u d e n t s
requiring permits are asked not to
apply to the U n i o n until M i k e
Elkin starts the scheme later this
term.

21 year old Boris Kalendarev has been trying to emigrate from the
Soviet U n i o n since 1973 and- was adopted by I C U n i o n and other
student organisations last year as part of a national campaign to
support the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel.
In 1977 he was expelled from College for applying to emigrate and
since then the Soviet authorities have tried to force h i m into the army.
H e now faces a probable charge of evading conscription which could
lead to a sentence of three years in a labour camp.
The Foreign Secretarys belief that Western protests are effective in
persuading the Soviet Government to act has received reinforcement
with the release last week of 13 year old M i s r h a Voikhanski who has
been trying to join his mother in England for the past four years.
Boris Kalendarevs fate now depends on how much pressure is exerted
on his behalf. M a r y Attenborough urges IC students to write a protest
letter to the Soviet State Procurator and suggests the following text.
7 am writing to ask you why Boris Kalendarev, a student m your country, has
been charged with evasion of conscription when he applied for an exil visa in 1973,
three years before he became eligible for military service.
7 urge you most strongly to release him as the action of the Soviet authorities in
arresting him is in flagrant defiance of the Helsinki Agreement and breaches every
acceptable standard of human rights'.
The letter should be addressed to M r R Rudenko, Procurator
General, Puskinskava U I . 15a, Moscow, U S S R .
