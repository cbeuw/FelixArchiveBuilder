Notalot has happened this term except the Rag Mag trip to Oxford on
Wednesday, however there are a few interesting events for the future,
the main events being the Handover Union Meeting, the Joint General
Committee Meeting and the mystery trip to the seaside. The Albert
Memorial and you'll be able to see both the old and the new Exec,
trouserless which is only one of the many goodies (I) in store.
The same evening (Tuesday 15th) the non-Exec posts will be elected
at the Joint Committee Meeting, Please let J o know in advance if you
want to come, there is a party afterwards for those who attend.
On Saturday 19th May a paltry 25p (in advance) will buy you a coach

the exams, so don't miss it!

RED CROSS AT I.C.
I would be glad to hear
f r o m anyone who can spare
time for collecting during
Red Cross week, M a y 6 - 12th.
Collectors are needed to go
round departments, to collect
in pubs, a n d for street
collections o n the Flag day,
Saturday 12th.
I would also be pleased to hear
from anyone interested in joining
the I C members group. There is a
commitment to only twelve hours
work a year and no qualifications
are necessary, but there is much
useful work that can be done;

Hospitals or an O l d Peoples C l u b ,

in July and August in Swanage
and Ross-on-Wye, fund-raising as
above etc.
