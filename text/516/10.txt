An opportunity to learn
about management with
one of the world's leading
marketing companies
Procter & Gamble is one of the world's most successful manufacturers of fast moving
consumer goods and acknowledged leaders in the marketing field. World wide sales
currently exceed £4000 million and have doubled every ten years.
From September 24th to September 28th, 1979, we will be entertaining a group of
undergraduates in their final year to an informal, but intensive course in marketing
management at our Head Office. Full accommodation and all expenses will be paid.
During the course, you will actively participate in business projects ranging from
Product Development and Consumer Research to Television Advertising and Instore
Promotion. At the end of the week, we will pull all the projects together to form a clear
overall picture of marketing management in a consumer-oriented company.
You will then really be able to decide whether you are suited to a career in marketing
management.
So, if you are interested in marketing—however vaguely you understand it at the
moment—you will enjoy the week and learn a lot.
If you're taking your finals in
1980 and are interested in
joining the Course, please ring
Christine Sheldon, reversing the charges,
on Newcastle upon Tyne H57141,

Division, Procter & Gamble Limited,

possible. Closing date for
applications is
18th May, 1979.
