Brain Drain
Sorry there hasn't been an article for such a long time (I
didn't notice really, did you?), but I've been working h a r d to get
a degree, and I a m afraid some of m y U n i o n responsibilities
have been neglected in the past few months. I know some
people have been waiting a long time for me to get things done,
but I really have been busy. Still, the finals are over now and I
have m o r e or less sobered up, so things should get seen to soon.
A n d remember, if there is anything you need doing in the U n i o n ,
write it down on a bit of paper and leave it on my desk in the office, (if
you can stand the sight of M i k e playing with himself) instead of just
telling me in the bar; I know this is the easiest place to find me but I
can't remember everything, so things usually get done quicker if they're
result. I hope everyone will co-
operate with this survey, and

Union keys
I'll be sending a note to all
U n i o n officers a n d society
chairmen soon asking for a list of
all U n i o n keys in their possession.
A survey needs to be done on this
because I don't know where some
keys are, and security in the
building is not very good as a
ihen it's finished I'll see to having
a number of locks changed.
Discount scheme
I'll be sending letters out soon
to shops near College to see if they
would be interested in taking part
in a local discount scheme, and
hope to have the scheme working

by the beginning of next term. If
there are any shops further away
from College which you think
would be particularly worth
writing to (eg perhaps some near
Hamelt Gardens?), put their
names and addresses on my desk
in the office sometime (keep your
eyes closed in case Mike's having
one of his fantasies and gets his
chopper out).
Telephones
At least one of the pay phones in
the U n i o n has actually been
working for the last 8 weeks
(possibly a record), until last week
when someone tried to break into
them to steal the money. H e
wasn't successful, and had better
not try again 'cos if I catch him
I'll not hesitate to get the police to
deal with him. Y o u have been
warned.
A n d remember, nowadays
some police murder people for
doing less than l i p p i n g off
telephone boxes.
Noise
I know I'm always complaining
about this, but remember people
living in Beit have exams this
term, so don't make too much
moise whilst coming out of the
U n i o n late at night. A n d I still
keep a bucket of water on the
balcony outside my room/above
Beit Archway.
Violence
There were a number of fights
at a party in the J C R last week,
including one 'bottling' incident
(for which there is going to be a
U n i o n Discipline Committee
meeting). This sort of thing has
got to stop; anyone I catch
causing trouble in U n i o n areas
won't be allowed to use U n i o n
facilities again lor a long time.
Elections
Papers are up for O r d i n a r y
Members of House (3 vacancies)
and Finance (2 vacancies) U n i o n

Papers come down at 5.00pm
today, so anyone interested who
wants to know more about what is
involved should comic and see me
in the office this lunchtime; if I'm
not around I shouldn't be long,
otherwise tell A n n i e when you
can come in the afternoon and 111
make sure I'm there.
Apologies
A r e due to everyone I met
around College during Easter,
whilst I was being even more
obnoxious than usual (yes, it is
possible) during the period
leading up to my exams, and to
many people I met the evening
after they'd finished.
Especially M i c h a e l , Helen,
Sheyne, Codface, IC R a d i o
(particularly Dave), H o w a r d .
Ros, and Simon. Sorry.

Elk's Epistle (7)
Well folks, the sun is shining
into my office window and I can
see the glorious summer has now
arrived - days of frolicking naked
in the fields and swimming
unclothed in the Serpentine.
U G M
We've only two left now - that
great institution, the (penul-
timate) U n i o n General Meeting
occurs on Tuesday (8th M a y ) at
l p m in the Great Hall. A l l of you
who experienced the docility ol
the E G M will be glad to know
that controversy is here again - a
motion against abortion has been
submitted - so if you've got strong
feelings on the subject make sure
you're there. There is also
elections for a l l the posts
mentioned in my article last week.
A l l the papers come down today
so if you would like to stand for
anything make sure you are fully
nominated by this afternoon.
Spaced Out
The S m o k e y B e a r s , a n
organisation that is dedicated to
legalising cannabis and uses more-
direct methods than the Legalise
Cannabis C a m p a i g n , is having a
smoke-in in Hyde Park on
Saturday M a y 12th (afternoon),
so if you wanna get high, maan -
you know where to go.
Colours
These are announced at the
A G M on M a y 22nd. in case you
were wondering what happened
to your nomination. They are all
considered by Colours C o m -
mittee and ratified by C o u n c i l

announced.
Well that is all for this week; I
think I'll now go and spread
grease all over my body and lit on
my skin tight one piece rubber
suit. Ooooh, too much.
