Dearest F E L I X Fans, - What
an endearing creepish start.
H i ! I ' m t h e n e w V i c e
President o f IF students
Union a n d have just been
asked to write an article on
myself - nothing I'd enjoy
more. M y name s u m s me all

S c i n t i l l a t i n g S e n s u o u s
Sparkling S u p e r b S e d d o n .
Perhaps you've noticed m e at
IC, that lovely-looking blonde
with b i g blue eyes a n d long
long legs (you haven't). No.
I had m y hair henna'd red last
week a n d now resemble a
carrot!
N o w down lo business. M y
manifesto mainly endeavours to
make everyone at I F less
lethargic, encourage them to join
in lots more I C 'IF activities (I am
sure you'd like that), and to be
seen more frequently at the U n i o n
Bar. because being a student also
involves enjoying oneself and
socialising, and as we have no bar.
we mav as well use yours.
O h no. I ' m waffling again and
being irrelevant-they always say I
am 'hors de sujet' at college! Y o u
really want to know about me -

Perhaps you'd like to know
my Easter holiday job...when I

crack a n d I was reduced by 3
inches. Yes, the heel had fallen off
my shoe. I don't know why, but
they said I would not be much of a
success in the business-world. I
thought it was rather original
hobbling round with only one
shoe.

MOTORWAY IMAGES
T h e sodium glare of motorwav lights
will not define the speeding silhouettes
of determined vehicles as they roar and whistle
over the shining wetness of endless road.
R e d tail lamps, swiftly receding, signal a short presence,
they seem warm, inviting, but elusive,
suggestive of comfortable capsules
protecting from night's inhospitality.
The whiteness of approaching headlamps, starlike, blinding.
They rush toward destinations in awesome droves
The flish-flash ol dependable blades •
across the streaming windscreen
comforts the weary driver and dozing travellers:
it is like their common pulse.
A stationary man might lose his sense ol spare
imagining this ribbon as the world itself
with half the people hurrying away, irretrievable,
and half rushing headlong, irresistable.
His the only stillness, somehow unnatural,
his constant companions unchanging, unending,
lights and barriers, tarmac and banks.
For h i m those slopes would mark worlds end.
T o us they have no meaning;
for can you not perceive yourself part ofthe urgent irallic
on a motorway of life?
T h e many signs present your choice, the miles record your work
and journey's end would thus depend
upon the route you took. p Q R A N D O M

MARANATHA
L i v i n g water.
N o w he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a town in Samaria
called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son
Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the
journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
W h e n a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,
"Wiltyou give me a drink.'" (His disciples had gone into the town to buv
lood. j
The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a feu- and I am a
Samaritan unman. How (an you ask me for a drink:'" (For Jews do not
associate with Samaritans.j
Jesus answered her, "// you knew the gift of (loci anil who il is thai asks you
foi a drink, )ou u tiultl hare asked him and he would have given you living water".
"Si I, I lie woman said, "you have nothing to draw Willi and ihe well is deep.

Ate you greater than our father Jacob, who
<J«I e u\ lire u ell anil thank from il himself as did a/so /ns sons and ins /links and
herds.'"
J e s u s a n s w e r e d , "Everyone who di inks this irafei will be ih/rs/y again, bul

gne turn it ill become in him a spring of water welling up lo everlasting life."
