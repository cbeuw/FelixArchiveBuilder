M A R T I N BELL IN INTERVIEW
29 May 1998
I still wonder w h y interviewers persist in asking
Martin Bell about his white suits a n d sundry
lucky charms that have been witness to more
grief a n d despair than a Kangol-hatted
Mancunian at M a i n e Road. I suspect it's o n the
instruction of their deluded editors that regard it
as a concession to what I suppose are n o w
called the h o u s e s p o u s e s of the nation.
Thankfully unburdened by such constraints, y o u
will hear no mention of white suits, kitsch pixies
or St Christopher's at 7 p m o n Thursday 4 June
when Imperial College Radio broadcasts its
recent interview with M r Bell. What y o u will hear
are the thoughts of a man w h o spent over three
decades reporting from the world's bloodiest
trouble spots; a man w h o challenged the fourth-
safest Tory seat in the last election - and w o n .
O n the 31 August this year, the B B C ' s infa-
mous w a r correspondent turned M P will be
sixty. H e w a s educated in Cambridge - first at
Leys School and then at King's College where he
read English. But achieving a double first had its
downside. For Bell, college wasn't three years of
late nights and later mornings at the taxpayers'
expense. " M y parents really s e l d o m had t w o
coins to rub together," he says, "I o w e d them a
lot because they really sacrificed for m y educa-
tion." A s a result, he worked harder than he
needed and missed out o n m u c h of college life.
L
Bell joined the B B C after college a n d went
on to report from over 70 war-torn countries.
Part of m e considers it an unenviable experi-
ence, one that must harden y o u to human suf-
fering. "I think rather the reverse", explains Bell.
"It sort of makes y o u aware of the blessings that
people w h o haven't been in these places some-
times take for granted." Apart from a very phys-
ical injury from flying shrapnel in Sarajevo, Bell is
adamant, to the point of persuading himself
that w a r has not scarred h i m : "I like to think it
hasn't done m e any harm. In fact, I have to." Yet
while Bell has survived, his t w o divorces suggest
the w a r c o r r e s p o n d e n t lifestyle c l a i m e d
casualties of its o w n .
Last year Bell quit the B B C to stand in the
general election at Tatton. W a s he used as a
pawn to return a tactical vote against Neil
Hamilton? W h y did Labour receive his lawyer's
bill? H o w does he see the future of British
broadcast journalism? Listen Thursday to find
out.

THE R E A L B L O N D E
Starring: M a t h e w M o d i n e , M a x w e l l Caulfield, Catherine Keener, Daryl Hannah, Elizabeth Berkely, Kathleen Turner
Director: T o m DiCillo * it
W
eird. Let m e say that
again. W - e - i - r - d . That's
the only w a y to describe
The Real Blonde. A mish-mash of
forties absurdist c o m e d y a n d
nineties sexual angst t o p p e d off
with a thoroughly eighties cast a n d
style, it's a film that's g o i n g
nowhere in a real hurry.
The plot is a somewhat convo-
luted tale of t w o o u t of work N e w
York actors struggling to find "real"
acting parts and their ideal w o m a n ,
a "real" blonde. Q u e u e liaisons
with various models and actresses,
as M o d i n e a n d Caulfield navigate
either e n d o f t h e greasy pole.
Whilst Caulfield lands a lucrative
role in a daytime soap, M o d i n e is
forced to work as a waiter while he
waits for a break.
W h e t h e r director DiCillio is
really trying t o parody the spiralling
idiocy of the glamour industry is
unclear, a n d certainly The Real
Blonde lacks the shameless satire
of his earlier works like Johnny
Suede and Living in Oblivion. What
results is really just a n unsurprising
romantic c o m e d y , advocating the
o n e - w o m a n philosophy of M o d i n e
as far happier than Caulfield's
string of one-night stands.
W h a t m a k e s the film s o
strange, however, are the bizzare
cameos which clutter t w o hours
worth of c e l l u l o i d . Christopher
Lloyd's c a m p head waiter, Kathleen
Turner's bitchy agent a n d Steve
Her a blonde? I don't think so.
Buscemi's l u w i e director provide
s o m e light relief, but the remainder
are straight from the shelf marked
"Quirky Hollywood characters".
A prime example c o m e s in the
form of Elizabeth Berkeley's blonde
actress/model. Berkley, previously
seen in those great American cult
icons Showgiris and Saved by the
Bell, improves o n her track record
and slides effortlessly from dismal
to merely average o n the acting
scale.
Yet the problem isn't her, it's
the role. She is the questionably
blonde actress w h o repeatedly
crosses M o d i n e ' s path a n d
attempts t o lure h i m away from his
girlfriend, played by the sparkling
Keener. The simple question is
why? She's a beautiful y o u n g
actress. H e ' s a miserable, thirty-
something, out of work actor. Then
there's the questionable point at
which fifty guys mistake her for
M a d o n n a o n the set of a video-
shoot. A s The Real Blonde so clear-
ly demonstrates, y o u can take sus-
pension of disbelief way t o o far.
In essence, the problem is that
the film boils d o w n to a dozen
poorly drawn caricatures running
around the screen in search of hap-
piness. Every m o d e l or actress a
d u m b blonde. Every m a n is thirty-
s o m e t h i n g , sexually frustrated,
angst-ridden a n d desperate.
The o n e "real" character comes
in the form of M o d i n e ' s long-suf-
fering girlfriend, Catherine Keener.
She's a make-up artist (and thus
c o m e s into daily contact with yet
more d u m b blondes and c a m p arty
types) trying to live her life without
giving into the constant harassment
and lechery that she faces every
day. Her scenes provide light relief
to the idiocy that seems to befall all
those around her. Sadly, however,
her story is only given a fraction of
the running time it deserves.
Indeed, the whole thing comes
together more as several individual
stories rather than as an inter-
weaved whole. Having gone their
separate ways early o n , M o d i n e
and Caulfield s e e m destined never
to see o n e another again, and none
of the characters really seem to
inter-relate o n anything more than
a sexual level. But then, perhaps
that's the point the DiCillio, w h o
also wrote the screenplay, is trying
to prove. D
