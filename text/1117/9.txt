What's In The Box ?
A new Monday night experience is about to hit the city, kicking off on the 1 June @ the Clinic, Gerard Street, Nr Shaftsbury Avenue. This is not
just another D8JJ night featuring the same old DJs as you hear everywhere. This night dares to be different bringing you the best of the new
breed, the next generation of DJs. Nice to see someone giving the up & coming guys 'n' girls a chance.

T
his isn't just a blatant plug for a new night,
the reason I'm mentioning, well, featuring
this new night is that the people involved
are taking the scene one step fur-
ther. They will be broadcasting live
from the club to all round the world
through the internet. A n d after last
week's m i s s i o n d e e p into the
underworld of pirate radio, I
though this week I'd stay o n the
right side of the law for a change
and play things a little, well, a lot
safer.
Yes this new night is going to be
broadcast live over the internet
from the Interface pirate radio site
@ http://interface.pirate-radio.co.uk so any-
one anywhere in the world with a PC and inter-
net connection can log o n and see h o w w e d o it
in London town, the heart of Drum &. Bass s o m e
would say.
Interface doesn't just broadcast D & B but
covers the phatest underground beats ranging
from Techno, Garage, Drum &. Bass and every-
thing in-between, but this time it's legal and it
reaches the four corners of the globe. Interface
isn't exactly new as it's been going for about a
year now, but it's a new m e t h o d of people get-
ting together, talking and meeting. It not only
broadcasts sound live but also includes live
video footage.
Interface is being hailed by many as the next
step forward for the scene, making pirate radio
look very limited in comparison. But that said
they have no need to worry at the m o m e n t as
only a small percentage of the people wanting
to hear this sort of music have the capabilities to
receive it where as everyone's got a radio. But
as time progresses, and the internet becomes

cheaper and more accessible to the general
population it's bound to have a large impact.

Ash, w h o ran Heart F M and then Face F M . From
these pirate stations A s h meet up with club pro-
moter and on-line anarchist Howard Jones. They
blagged a load of software and started Interface
- broadcasting 24hrs a day over the net. N o w ,
a year later, they have state-of-the-art equip-
ment and an average of 8 0 , 0 0 0 listener a week,
with some 6,000 at any one time.
I meet up with Paul Ibiza, who's involved
with Interface and is promoting The Box, which
is going to be broadcast live over the net.
I asked him: What is it all about?
It's a new way of learning what's going o n .
It's like the pirates, but with pirates y o u don't
know w h o you're running with, or who's con-
trolling it - gangsters and all that yeah. With
Interface it's m u c h safer first it's totally legal as
anyone • can put information on the net.
Secondly it's very expensive to set up therefore
you need big business backing it. What y o u get
is not just the music but also live pictures so it's
really a mini television. It a safe way to move
around, I've been following this c r o w d for some
time n o w and there safe, a nice bunch. This is
the future y a know, as time goes on
more and more people will get con-
nected up and it will naturally take
over.
What DJs can we expect to hear
playing on Interface?
It's not about the big boys, it's
about giving p e o p l e like y o u a
chance. They [big names] have
priced themselves out of it, charging
£ 3 0 0 - 4 0 0 an hour. I can't afford
that, and ultimately it c o m e s back o n
the punters w h o have to pay inflated
prices to go out. So what we're doing is giving
people like you a chance, y o u c o m e d o w n bring
a few people spread the w o r d and all that and if
all the DJs bring d o w n a few people we'll have a
little party atmosphere going and that's all you
need to get things started. It'll build from that.
We'll have a camera m a n running about all
over the place filming it for the live broadcast,
so if people can't make it d o w n , they can see
what is going o n on your computer screen and
if they like what they see, they will c o m e d o w n
the next week.
We're going to be very strict o n the door,
making sure only the right sort of people are
c o m i n g in, w e ain't going to be letting no hoods
in or any of that. W e want to create a pleasant
party vibe, no attitude, no hassle.

got a whole load of guest list places to give

D.O.S.E
Crack Man In Bat Den Sex Shock
Strange title for a strange tune.
D&-B with heavy use of electric gui-
tar - not s o m e t h i n g I've ever
thought would go well together
and this track reminds m e why. The
underlying track is actually quite
good, if a little hectic, and if most
of the guitar bits were taken out it
might just click as there are a few
small bits where it sounds alright
but mainly N O !
The other two tracks are in a
more hip-hop / downbeat style and
I like these m u c h more, slowing
rocking beats that ooze phatness
unpolished rugged breaks and grit-
ty fx. M u c h more like it.
Fillippa Don't Explain (MCA)
The original mix is a totally laid
back track with a live jazz cafe
sound deep 'n' m o o d y with the
exquisite voice and lyrics of Fillippa
completing the experience. Also a
livelier mix from Steppa's which is
at a strange tempo somewhere
between D&JB and downbeat. A n
intelligent D&VB feel and beat struc-
ture but at a slightly slower pace
probably to keep the voice of
Fillippa audible which compliments
the beats ' n ' breaks superbly. O n e
for those easy-going numbers for
the summer nights ahead.
Prime Suspect Case I
(Rise 'n' Shine)
Ah ooh ooh eh ooh ooh is full of
plenty of funky fresh garage groves.
Using simply beats but it's the lay-
ers of clever key patterns, title
vocal stabs and key changes that
get you moving. The Two Step Mix
also has the same set up vocals
and keys, but uses different beats.
Retro Vibe in a happy happy style
with a big piano break that spoils it
for me. Finally Dirty Tune is a little
stormer Richard Purser has defi-
nitely got his key patterns, xylo-
phone s o u n d i n g bing bongs all
sorted. I love the way he keeps
adding little bits of this ' n ' that
samples etc cutting in and out like
it's in the mix. W i c k e d track.
Full Intention.
You Are Somebody?
Described as the undisputed kings
of disco house, Full Intention bring
us a uplifting dance track with
d i s c o overtones. O n the more
commercial side of house this track
has a pretty lame vocal telling y o u
'are s o m e b o d y ' , but under this
slightly lame exterior there are in
fact s o m e rough beats. So if you
can handle the lyrics and disco
sounds this is a well made tune.
For the more underground buyer
their are t w o harder mixes -
London mix and the Dark Dub
which has a dark bassline totally
changing the feel of the track. Not
as bad as I though it would be.
