COLUMNS 29 May 1998
I don't w h y , but s o m e
p e o p l e in this College
think I a m a prophet of
d o o m , incapable of saying any-
thing positive about Imperial,
someone w h o delights in rubbish-
ing this esteemed institution. As
you know, dear reader, this is non-
sense. Anyone w h o has really read
my articles will k n o w that any
attacks on particular parts of IC are
borne of support and affection for
the College as a whole. If m o n e y is
wasted, w e limit the College's abil-
ity to prosper, so a rant against the
transgressor is for the greater
g o o d . However, I'll be honest and
say that I never thought I w o u l d
have a g o o d w o r d for the Ante
R o o m exhibitions. Then, as if by
magic, s o m e artwork appeared.
G o o d artwork. Not the work of an
educationally s u b n o r m a l gorilla,
but paintings of obvious form and
artistic insight. The m o d e r n 'art'
that w e have been subjected to
previously was devoid of any of
the quality present in truly great
contemporary work such as that of
Warhol, Hockney and Lichtenstein.
The exhibition has n o w finished,
but hopefully will herald a dramat-
ic upturn in the quality that w e can
expect. The sensationalist p a p
exhibited as part of the Lottery bid
for the M u s i c and Arts Centre was
simply trying too hard, and was
disingenuous to even the most
casual observer.
Even though the
bid is perceived
by s o m e in Qj
Sherfield to be V

gratulated.
N o w that I have done my nice
c o p bit, it's time for nasty cop.
W h e n I stroll d o w n the stairs in the
Chemistry department, undertak-
ing our daily evacuation, t w o
things occur with absolutely cer-
tainty. Firstly, the fire alarm has
malfunctioned, rather than indicat-
ing the imminent consumption of
SW7 by an e n o r m o u s fireball.
Secondly, at least three people will
ask me to m o a n about said false
alarm in Felix. Such is the frequen-
cy of this upheaval that it is no
longer taken seriously, which, in a
building that is packed to the
rafters with gas
' cylinders a n d
I I I flammable sol-
vents, is slightly
c o n c e r n i n g .
Recently, the
alarm failed to

7 jKLg such disrup-
•II —""^ tions, and some
f""+ would say that I
have a compar-
atively easy time of it. G o d knows
how sanity w a s preserved in
Princes Gardens w h e n the alarms
were upgraded a few years ago.
Fortunately for Chemistry, the
College realise that this a top pri-
ority, given the risks associated
with it, and I don't just mean the
undergraduates. In order to
resolve the problems, Estates will
do almost anything to sort things
out. Anything, that is, except
spend the m o n e y necessary to fix
the areas that are forever malfunc-
tioning. Believe me, if people were
injured or killed in a fire that was
not indicated by the alarm, you
would have to d i g considerably
deeper into the Imperial pocket to
cover the cost.
It has been a while since I have
forced my televisual tastes upon
you, but I must mention In the
Red, the new black c o m e d y that
started on B B C 2 o n Tuesday. This
is unusual in that it is essentially a
satire of the B B C by the BBC,
which must have resulted in some
rather anxious people, having the
same effect that Yes, Minister had
on Whitehall. The cast is superb,
the script extremely witty and, if
that were not enough, marvellous-
ly scathing about N e w Labour.
What more could a man require?
This is imperial, remember.
