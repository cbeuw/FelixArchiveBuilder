a m n fine cast. D a m n silly
plot. A n d , er, that about
sums it u p , because Wild
Things, whilst sounding like box-
office gold o n paper, is ultimately a
very disappointing film
It's an attempt to produce an
old fashioned thriller - s t r o n g
ensemble cast, absolutely no spe-
cial effects a n d a plot twistier than
a snake that's had a run-in with a
corkscrew. Sadly, however, it turns
out to be a thriller harking back to a
different age - the early eighties in
fact, with long lingering shots of
sun soaked beaches a n d scantily
clad, dripping wet teenage girls.
The pre-publicity describes
Wild Things as a hot, sexy thriller -
yet even those w h o g o to see it
simply o n these grounds will be
disappointed as the sex scenes are
rare, brief a n d as erotic as Prime
Minister's question time. O h , a n d
Neve Campbell has a no-nudity
clause in her contract, so there.
For the rest of us, however, the
plot and acting m a y be of more
immediate c o n c e r n . Everything
begins promisingly as spoilt rich-
kid Richards t h r o w s herself at
teacher Dillon, a n d then accuses
him of rape. Dillon finds himself
standing alone against the might of
Richards' family. Sacked, homeless
and guilty in the eyes of the t o w n ,
he turns to the o n e person w h o will
defend h i m - washed u p lawyer
Murray. So far, so g o o d , so pre-
dictable.
However, now it all starts to get
complicated, as twist after twist tie
both cast a n d plot in knots.
Campbell adds to the allegations,
Wild Things - girls in tight tops aplenty.
claiming that Dillon has raped her
too, a n d Bacon arrives o n the
scene to investigate. I won't spoil it
for y o u by saying what happens
next, suffice to say that at times it
seems to happen without rhyme
nor reason.
Indeed, the chain of events
leading t o the on-screen antics only
really begins to b e c o m e clear as
the closing credits roll, and a series
of flashbacks attempts to explain
what the hell's been going o n for
the last t w o hours. .
Sadly, however, all the plot
twists c o m e across as utterly point-
less. A t points the turns c o m e so
fast that it all becomes laughable,
and quite frankly w e simply don't
care about these people.
Richards smoulders in an utter-
ly predictable way, a n d doesn't
seem t o o fussy about taking her
top off at every available opportu-
nity. Bacon projects his usual cold,
hard exterior a n d Dillon is clearly
up to something from start to fin-
ish. Only Murray, in a hilarious
c a m e o of a Grisham style lawyer,
and Campbell, playing against type
as drugged u p trailer-trash shine,
Wild Things is a sad enditement
of that stock phrase "they don't
make them like they used t o " . It
tries to succeed as an o l d - f a s h :
ioned thriller, but ultimately gives in
and simply tries to cash in o n the'
sex appeal of its y o u n g stars....And
fails. O

STAR P R O F I L E :

O
nce u p o n a time, Kevin
B a c o n w a s a virtually
u n k n o w n bit-part actor
doing the rounds in Hollywood,
without ever looking destined for
major stardom. Then something
c a m e to change all that...Yet unlike
other A-list actors, Bacon's big
break c a m e not through a classic
role or a part in a Jim Cameron
flick. N o , w h e n I speak of Bacon's
big break, 1 speak of course of the
Kevin Bacon game.
You see, Kevin Bacon's rise to
international fame has nothing to
d o with everything to d o with
s o m e bored American College stu-
dents a n d the internet. For as it is
told in legend, these students
started trying t o link every film in
the Universe together, taking Kevin
Bacon as their centre, a n d for-
sooth, a legend w a s born.
For t h o s e of y o u still i g n o -

m / b a c o n . h t m l .
As far as actual acting is con-
cerned, however, Bacon's career
has been filled with so-so support-
ing roles. Whilst his performances
in Sleepers and particularly Murder
in the First brought s o m e degree of
critical a c c l a i m , he has been
unable to produce consistently.
M o r e importantly, however, his
choice of roles has frequently let
him d o w n . Witness such appaling
mundane films as The River Wild,
Picture Perfect a n d this week's
Wild Things. H e seems too intent
on cashing in o n "star vehicles"
rather than promoting himself to
the big m o n e y leagues.
