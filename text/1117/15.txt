LIKE, L O V E HATE, A D O R E
Deirdre Purcell
T
his is a haunting a n d
poignant book, dealing as it
d o e s with the s o m e w h a t
controversial subjects of date rape
and the general treatment of y o u n g
men by society in general. The
chief protagonist, a y o u n g man of
nineteen, is the youngest brother
of Angela, a w o m a n w h o has
watched her mother die of an
unnamed illness, presumably AIDS,
and seen her family split up and
taken into care. James, only t w o
months old at the time of his
mother's death, was brought up by
his fiercely protective and loving
sister, and has n o w b e c o m e a
scowlingly handsome y o u n g m a n ,
who is accused of raping a girl w h o
he claims lead him o n . W h e n he is
convicted of sexual assault, all hell
breaks loose, and he is repeatedly
beaten up, sent hate mail and
wished dead or castrated by an
increasingly hostile public. W i t h
only one side of the story ever
heard in the media, the girl's, the
whole of Ireland are against him,
and, except in the eyes of his sis-
ter, he can d o no right. This book
also tracks Angela's family history,
from her dysfunctional childhood,
to her tentative and burgeoning
romance with Ken. The story is
heart-breakingly honest a n d
extremely painful to read. Half-way
through, I was practically crying, as
the w h o l e of Ireland, including
Angela's so-called best friend,
Patsy, turns o n James with a wish
to utterly destroy him, and even
Angela, with her capability to love,
forgive and understand, is unable
to see a solution to her troubles.
The book is groundbreaking in
its power and honesty, and its sub-
ject matter. It does not pretend to
be an easy read, it is challenging,
and will make y o u think. This book
flies in the face of received w i s d o m
a n d public o p i n i o n , a n d poses
challenging and demanding ques-
tions. W h y d o we show such little
care and compassion towards the
g r o w i n g underclass of y o u n g ,
unemployed men? Why, in a case
of rape, or sexual assault d o we
only ever hear the victim's side?
Why does the media never spare
the families of the alleged aggres-
sor? With books like this challeng-
ing our perspective on life, I hope
that the balance may swing the
other way slightly, and allow for the
feelings of the man to be taken into
consideration.

THE B A N D
Enrico Brizzi
T
o be a m o d e r n writer, it
appears that y o u have to lit-
tle, if any, idea about gram-
mar, a limited vocabulary, a cynical
attitude towards life and a g o o d
grasp of slang. To heralded as a
new JD Salinger, y o u need to write
a rambling, practically incompre-
hensible account of someone's life,
have it hyped up by the media and
then sit back and talk about p o p
culture. The author of this book has
been hailed as the bologna version
of JD Salinger, with his quirky, off-
beat prose, and his fairly accurate
portrayal of a disillusioned, genera-
tion X Italian teenager. Alex, his
anti-hero, falls in love with Aidi,
who breaks his heart, by refusing to
b e c o m e his steady girlfriend and by
going to America to study English.
That is the plot, in a sentence. If we
add to that the boy's musings on
life in general, his drop-out friends,
and his opinions on the other chil-
dren at his school, we have the
entire novel. A n d it's not very g o o d .
The book has been effusively
praised by the m e d i a across
European, Enrico Brizzi has been
lauded to the skies, and yet, when
it c o m e s d o w n to it, the hero in the
book is a pain, the girl is two-
dimensional and the other people
are stock characters: from the
Drug-Taker a n d the Spoilt,
Unhappy, M i s u n d e r s t o o d Rich Boy
to the Smug, Self-Satisfied Virgins
and the Boring, Bourgeoisie par-
ents. To begin with, 1 was interest-
ed in the book as a portrayal of
Italian Youth Culture today, but
after a while, I became bored. By
the end of the book, I shrugged,
and just thought, "who cares?" The
slacker style of writing gets dull
after a while, and the book wasn't
sufficient to keep me interested for
any appreciable length of time.
Italia: nul points.

LITERARY PRIZES
The Orange Prize For
Fiction
This year is the third anniversary of
this somewhat controversial prize
Orange Prize for w o m e n writers. As
the largest prize for fiction in the
country, £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , it is often
thought that the gender restrictions
should be relaxed, making the prize
open to both m e n and w o m e n . This
year, as last, it was w o n by a
Canadian author, Carol Shields,
with her book, Larry's Party, a story
of male angst at the end of the
twentieth century. With 7-2 o d d s in
her favour, Carol Shields' book
seemed to be an obvious choice,
dealing as it does with m e n ; in
effect offering an olive branch to
the opposite sex in apology for
their exclusion. It seems stupid to
practise this type of segregation in
the late twentieth century, and
there is a strong possibility that the
prize will be opened to both sexes
during the next few years. Certainly
critics are becoming hostile on the
subject. In my opinion, however,
the segregation is a g o o d idea, and
I w o u l d like to see an equivalent
prize being offered to male novel-
ists. In this way, the books can be
judged purely on their merit, and
not on any gender bias. M e n and
w o m e n tend to write about differ-
ent topics, each deal with life in
their o w n way, and it is interesting
to compare styles and ideas. With
separate prizes, more books will be
brought forward into the public
eye, and genuinely talented writers
will be given s o m e publicity, with
limelight hoggers like Martin Amis
and Will Self put aside.
This year the shortlist consisted
of Pauline Melville's The
Ventiloquists Tale, Deirdre Purcell's
Love Like Hate Adore, Kirsten Bakis'
Lives of the Monster Dogs, A n n
Patchett's The Magician's Assistant
and Anita Shreve's The Weight of
Water, as well as Carol Shields'
Larry's Party. Each book is as p o w -
erful and evocative as each other,
and all will be reviewed in Felix in
the next few weeks.
