Wharton to Resign
DAVID ROBERTS
Imperial College Union has found
itself without a full compliment
of sabbaticals-elect once again,
as Dave Wharton, elected in
February as Deputy President
(Finance &. Services) for 98/99, is
expected to resign his post today.
M r Wharton, a second year
maths student, feels certain that he
will be asked to re-sit the year, and
thus will automatically be d e e m e d
unable to take up a sabbatical posi-
tion. A s a result, he has made the
decision to resign now, to allow his
successor to be elected in time to
take over from the present incum-
bent, Rob Clark, on 1 July.
Whilst expressing sorrow for M r
Wharton on a personal level, ICU
President Andy Heeps has praised
the decision to stand d o w n , rather
than waiting until official results are
announced in July. However, he
e m p h a s i s e d that M r W h a r t o n ' s
decision to tender his resignation
rests with him alone, w h o has
made a "very bold decision, in the
best interests of the Union".
A decision to await official c o n -
firmation of his results could have
left the Union in the state of limbo
it experienced at the beginning of
this year, w h e n D P (Clubs fk
Societies) elect Smita Chaturvedi
only discovered she had failed her
exams in mid-Summer. The conse-
quent election was thus unable to
take place until November 1 1, and
the Union found itself one sabbati-
cal short for in excess of two
months.
M r Wharton's fellow sabbati-
cals-elect also expressed sorrow
that he would not be taking up his
elected office. H o w e v e r , they
h o p e d that his decision to stand
aside now, would allow a suitable
replacement to be found, to join
Dave Wharton; exam trouble
the other victors from February -
Dave Hellard, A d a m Cherington
and Ed Sexton - as the elected face
of ICU.
The a n n o u n c e m e n t of Dave
Wharton's resignation, m a d e by
Andy Heeps at on Thursday after-
noon, immediately triggers off a
fresh round of sabbatical elections
- the third set in as many terms this
year. In the words of M r Heeps,
"Here we go again".
Although there is insufficient
time to run the usual five week
election process (with only four
weeks remaining this term), M r
Heeps is determined to see a full
compliment of sabbaticals elected
before the summer, to allow a
s m o o t h hand-over between the
incoming and outgoing officers.
Speaking to Felix he made his feel-
ings very clear, "the position is a
vital o n e w h i c h w e must fill".
Consequently, he will ask an extra-
ordinary m e e t i n g of the ICU
Council, convened at today's A G M ,
to suspend the election regula-
tions.
If C o u n c i l concurs with M r
Heeps recommendation, this will
allow the normal fortnight of cam-
paigning to be cut to a single week,
so that elections can be held in the
final week of term. Papers for the
post will g o up next Wednesday
and will be posted for two weeks.
The election itself 'is provisionally
pencilled in for Wednesday and
Thursday 24 and 25 June, produc-
ing a final result for the final day of
term.
Although rumours of intended
candidatures abound, there are at
present no c o n f i r m e d runners.
A n y o n e interested in standing
should contact A n d y Heeps or the
present incumbent, Rob Clark, in
the Union Office.
King's Union Manager Sacked
ED S E X T O N
King's college student union's
(KCLSU) general manager, James
Chirgwin, has finally been sacked
for committing numerous
offences over the past year,
including fraud and drunken
behaviour.
Chirgwin had been suspended
for five months on full pay before
being sacked, revealed KCLSU's
student newspaper, ROAR. O n
one o c c a s i o n Chirgwin w a s so
drunk that he refused to leave a
building during a fire alarm, despite
the presence of the Fire Brigade at
the incident. At the time Chirgwin
was head licensee of the KCLSU
bars and was often found drunk in
union buildings, endangering their
license.
Other offences included cash-
ing cheques at the Union, which
later bounced, and running up a
Â£ 2 5 0 bar tab in a period of one
month, which he wrote off as "pro-
motion of the union". He also
authorised himself wage advances
and attempted to cover up his mis-
deeds by telling one staff member
to destroy the bar's safe record
book.
Chirgwin rarely turned up to
union meetings a n d c o m m i t t e d
several other minor offences and
breaches of union regulations. He
