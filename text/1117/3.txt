Letters to Felix...
HOUSE OF HELL III CRACKING.THE
Dear Editor,
Reading D a m i a n Fell's letter
( H o u s e o f Hell, Felix 1113)
p r o m p t e d memories of m y o w n
experience of living in 4 2 Queen's
Gate Gardens as tenants of the
notorious M r s Sofaer. W e t o o paid
£ 6 5 for cleaning which w a s never
d o n e a n d £ 1 6 a month for s o m e -
one t o carry our rubbish from t h e
landing to the front door, a task for
which I w o u l d have gladly accepted
such a princely s u m .
Our main gripe w a s the leaky
lavatory. It took six months of bad-
gering t o g e t it half-heartedly
patched a n d it smelt awful in t h e
m e a n t i m e . W h e n o u r s h o w e r
leaked into t h e flat below M r s
Sofaer rang us up t o tell us not t o
shower a n d that if the flat below
c o m p l a i n e d again W E w o u l d be
charged for t h e repairs t o H E R
plumbing.
In t h e first f e w w e e k s w e
n o t i c e d a strange mysterious
a r o m a about the place. It remained
mysterious until w e d i s c o v e r e d
that the cooker w a s leaking gas. To
her credit, M r s Sofaer reacted rela-
tively quickly (within a month) by
buying a n e w cooker. This does not
make u p for t h e danger in which
my flatmates a n d I were placed.
The wiring w a s over fifty years
old a n d failed us o n several occa-
sions. Twice t h e flat w a s broken
into a n d cash stolen. Police r e c o m -
m e n d e d changing t h e locks; t h e
front door could be o p e n e d with a
credit card. Predictably, no action
was taken.
Mrs Sofaer only accepts rent in
cash from students. I a m unsure of
her motives, but I a m told it m a y be
something to d o with tax.
I feel I should apologise to Felix
readers for not revealing this horror
story previously. W h e n w e left last
Summer, all w e could think of w a s
getting away a n d enjoying the holi-
days. I hope that this serves as a
warning t o people thinking of rent-
ing from M r s Sofaer next year, if
she is not in prison.
Yours 8 x .

Dear Felix
Because o f a computer i n c o m -
patibility problem, I have not been
able t o read the disk which gives
m e the students' names to g o with
the candidates' numbers for m y
final year exam. I have, however,
already drawn up m y mark sheets,
complete with names. Cracking the
name/number c o d e for a course
with only 17 students is easy by
using logic, but that has been
unnecessary as students write s o
differently from each other. M y
course w a s their last o n e before
the exam, so their writing was fresh
in m y mind, particularly from prac-
tical books.
One student loves t o use the
phrase 'just t o name a few", a n d
frequently puts plural nouns with
singular verbs, s o his answers
quickly identified h i m . W o r d confu-
sions of t h e roaster/rooster a n d
flavour/favour type were typical of
one student. Several students have
poor spelling, but make different
types of error. O n e , for example,
gets -cle a n d -cal ending confused,
so "practicle" in one answer identi-
fied her. Errors more typical of
overseas students, with a different
style of writing, identified another
candidate.
Even though m a n y course
essays were printed, handwriting is
a give-away t o s o m e o n e w h o has
marked essays, exam questions
from o l d papers a n d a long practi-
cal book from each student. O n e
has large and very irregular letters,
while another has very rounded let-
ters, with distinctive curly tops t o
s o m e of t h e m . O n e has neat writ-
ing sloping uniformly t o t h e left,
and another has writing which can
slope t o t h e left, right, o r be
upright, in different sections of an
answer. Spiky writing in black foun-
tain pen ink identifies one student.
Another writes the letter "n" like an
"in". Others have writing which is
distinctive in size, slope, regularity,
colour of ink, or fountain p e n nib or
ball-point p e n .
Deadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for
length, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.
Letters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe
card when submitting them.
One student regularly writes
outstanding answers in a particular
style, in black ink, with lots of out-
side r e a d i n g q u o t e d . A n o t h e r
excellent student writes in a differ-
ent style, in smaller blue handwrit-
ing. Another lives o n a farm and
s h o w e d a great depth of first-hand
k n o w l e d g e o n a n agricultural
question.
By the time 1 had marked one
answer each, I h a d - without trying
and without particularly wanting it -
a pretty clear idea of which student
had written which script. By the
time I h a d finished all the answers,
I w a s absolutely certain of which
names went with which scripts. I
shall of course check that 1 a m cor-
rect before handing in the mark list.
It is only for about the last two
years that w e have h a d numbers
instead o f names o n answer books
for finals in our department. It is
easier t o mark with candidates'
numbers than with names as the
marking s e e m s more impersonal,
though I d o not think that knowing
the names has any influence o n the
marking. In theory, using only can-
didates' numbers means that one
cannot take into account w h e n
marking that this student w a s away
ill for t w o weeks, or that another
had d o n e an extended essay relat-
ed t o o n e of the questions (that is
almost possible t o avoid). The stu-
dents told m e that those things
were matters o f luck a n d d i d not
need taking into account in the
marking.
M y papers are second-marked
by another m e m b e r of staff, and
the excellent closeness of our t w o
sets of marks has been unaffected
by t h e change f r o m names t o
marks. A visiting examiner from
another college, w h o did not know
our students, re-marked several
scripts carefully each year, almost
always agreeing with o u r marks,
whether w e had names or numbers
on t h e scripts. The answers may
also be looked at by external exam-
iners a n d chairmen of sub-boards
of examiners, especially for stu-
dents borderline between degree
classes, s o there are plenty of safe-
guards against bias. Code-cracking
in this w a y w o u l d be m u c h harder
in a larger class.
