Gliders' Holiday
The weather's plan to get rid of us
began long before w e arrived. N o
sooner had everyone reached the
;f the Long M y n d on Thursday
afternoon, than the snow began to
fall. Alas, it was to be a white Easter!
lan McAskill &- C o . had got it wrong
again arid the 5-day forecast was
not worth ihe p a p a u vias prinred

. indi-
t ate great flying weather.
The heavy snow fall continued
on G o o d I riday. Fortunately, there is
a fantastic warm a n d cosy club-
house. With the heavy snow and
unlikely imminent change in the
weather,, some attempted to leave
early before getting snowed in. It
was too late! By the evening, there
were snow drifts of 2-3 feet. All
roads to the M y n d were impass-
able. This was a blessing in disguise.
The brave (some w o u l d say
mad) people of icGC w h o made it
to the M y n d this Easter were Andy
H o l m e s , Lynsey Geldeard, J.P.
Lodge, M e i n h a r d Ober, Charlie
Wilson, Neil M o t h e w , Jane a n d
Afandi. Those w h o planned to c a m p
in tents outside managed to find
room in the bunkhouse.
The snowfall continued o n
Saturday. This did not stop us from
having fun. With the CFls Toyota
Land Cruiser, a long rope, Andy set
the ICGC speed record at 25 m p h -
sledging speed record, that is. As
soon as the show stopped for fif-
teen minutes, the hanger doors
were cleared a K21 wheeled out.
without wasting a second, the CFI
was conducting a test flight to check
the conditions. W e all managed a
short five minute flight each before
the weather closed in again.
.... Things could only get better,
and they did! O n Sunday, the snow
began to thaw, it was to be a great
gliding day; M a n y new members
experienced soaring conditions for
the first time. Andy 'Gliding -God'
Holmes flew 296, the club's Grob
102, for well over an hour before he
got hungry and came d o w n for
some lunch. Jane and Afandi had a
bit of a go in the single-seater as
well. It was a g o o d day for beginners
also. I had my two longest flights yet
and got lots of exercises covered.
The retrieve winch was fantastically
efficient and there was hardly any
wait to be launched. The recovery of
landed gliders was somewhat more
difficult in the snow. This required a
4 W D and some patience.
Despite the unlikely weather
conditions, a fun time was had by all
and we got some flying in as well.

THE UNION BITES
BACK
Dear Felix,
In response to your article
[Felix 1116 You're Going Down
with the Bookstore], we would like
to thank the Southside posse for a
great day and evening, however
we would like to reply in kind:
What IS it like to sell crap
beer? Next time y o u run out of
plastic skiffs we will happily lend
you some more.
W e would like to thank the
girls referee for his entertaining
interpretation of the rules and the
flowers he sent them (guilt trip?).
Sorry for picking the girls w h o can
play the beautiful game! H a d we
known your boys had impared
vision (sunglasses) and chesty
coughs (fags) we would have not
wasted our time and let the girls
team beat you instead.
W e look forward to other such
events.
Ed Seb
WHAT'S GOING
O N ?
Dear Felix,
I realise that it's the summer
term, and hence that field sports
such as rugby, football and hockey
have gone in to hibernation, but
why don't w e hear about the rest
for a change?
The smack of leather on wil-
low, the burst of chalk as the ten-
nis ball makes another perfect ace,
even w h a t the mountaineering
club had for dinner this week. All
these civilised sports should be
featuring prominently, yet it seems
that cricketers, tennis players,
golfers, croquet players, climbers
and cyclists are no more literate
than the rugby henchmen.
Surely the boat club - the most
overfunded and coveted organisa-
tion in the history of Imperial
College - could tell us what they
have to s h o w for the untold mil-
lions this week?
Sportsmen and w o m e n of the
college - take up your pens and
write!
