A Thousand Leaves * * '/2
A
Thousand Leaves is a collection of
eleven lo-fi songs, each with a similar
structure a n d an average track time of
about seven minutes. The length of the songs
is the largest problem here. Sonic Youth m a y
just feel obliged to fill studio time or dead
album time with amalgams of distortion a n d
feedback. They m a y feel
that it's cool to be radio-
unfriendly, as most of the
musical breaks c o m e slap
bang in the middle of a
track, as o p p o s e d to the
beginning or e n d where
they c o u l d be cut off.
Whatever the reason for
this sonic meddling, these
detours only serve to be
detrimental to the overall
Sonic Youth sound. Sadly,
even this isn't that m u c h
to write h o m e about. It's
O K but it's not five star
material. Perhaps the
m i d - s o n g noises are only a d d e d to make the
otherwise mediocre material stand out.
The album opens with the misleading
Contre Le Sexisme. It's misleading because
it's probably the poorest piece of material
available for aural consumption. It's basically a
third-rate Portishead number. It's melancholic
enough but there's a lack of cohesion present
that gives us a feeling of disjointedness. The
following track, Angel, manages to hit the
spot, though. It just about maintains its eeri-
ness without diving into a mass of confused
noise. This unsettling nature is kept in balance
by the melody. It's perhaps of worth to note
that this is one of the shorter tracks, at five
minutes. From there, w e
are teased with promising
n u m b e r s like Female
Mechanic on Duty, Hits of
Sunshine (for Allen
Ginsberg) a n d Heather
Angel, only for our hopes
to be d a s h e d by periods
of unwanted cacophony.
If this album w a s forty
minutes long instead of
seventy-five then it would
be a lot more accessible
and, in turn, better. Sonic
Y o u t h are n o mugs,
though a n d they have pur-
p o s e l y r e c o r d e d this
album in this way. This is a mistake. After all,
reviews could be written half in English and
half in Fortran but it doesn't d o anyone any
favours.

Pulsars Submission to the Master
If Electronic ever split u p a n d reformed, one
more step away from N e w Order, the result
would be the Pulsars. Friendly tune a n d not t o o
electronic to deviate from the mainstream.
Dawn of the Replicants / Smell Voodoo (EP)
Another churned out single by the Replicants.
H o w they got signed I don't know, but again, the
talent of a terrible singer meets the tuneless
noise of an untalented band a n d this is the
result. Please just admit defeat a n d g o a n d
wither away.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Embrace Come Back to What You Know
For all of those w h o thought Good Good people
was just a one-off Oasis cribbed fluke (I count
myself as one) this single reveals the quality
Embrace have been claiming u p o n themselves
for all this time. This is nothing short of an
anthem of sheer musical perfection. The critics
certainly will be laid to rest.
Silversun Too Much, Too Little, Too Late
A lot more 'cuddly' than I w a s expecting, almost
the Beegees, but with a tiny bit of token guitar-
ing. Might appeal to 14 year o l d Brian A d a m s
fans, but not many others.
John Martyn Excuse Me Mister
1 don't like white singers trying black blues; it
doesn't work, unless they make it their o w n (eg
Eric Clapton). Martyn just tries to imitate with-
out the soul of the attitude. What Blues song
have y o u ever known that sings about not call-
ing someone mister because he's bad to the
environment a n d is giving Mr's a b a d name?
David H.
Blue Rose The Disconnected EP
Very well constructed melancholic indie. Sad
ballads, chilling acoustic tunes reminiscent of
S i m o n a n d Carfunkel but the last track,
Everything we need, is ultimately uplifting.
Bound to d o well.
Comfort The Proof of You
Strong female vocals run over melodious guitar
driven tunes, a bit like Catatonia but not as
annoyingly Welsh! Nothing really inspirational
or n e w here but the Proof of You is a g o o d indie-
pop tune.
Cornelius Chapter 8
Strange vocal harmonies a n d weird effects
drive Cornelius in the direction of the B o o
Radley's Giant Steps album. O d d , very o d d
indeed.
Future Loop Foundation Karma
An excellent tribally influenced single with g o o d
strong drum 'n' bass lines, definitely spooky.
The Click 'n' Cycle mix is mellower but not as
g o o d as the t o p original track.
Montepulciano Ola Chica
Really cheesy latin/samba influenced pop/disco
bastard. The lead singer/crooner really should
be fired, along with the rest of the band. The
instrumental H o l l y w o o d mix isn't b a d though.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Transglobal Underground Rejoice Rejoice
(Album sampler)
Every ethnic sound y o u can imagine, from
Arabic singing a n d Indian tablas to gypsy-peas-
ant folk tunes are c o m b i n e d with excellent
dance beats. A must for alternative dance
freaks. Brilliant.
Sleater-Kinney One More Hour
Screaming punk attitude from the m u c h lauded
American ring-piece. Riot girls cross over into
the mainstream? M a y b e . The B-side, Don't
Think You Wanna, is a Nirvana-esque rocker
though.
Ramzi
