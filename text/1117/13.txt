STEINBERG'S DAY O F A T O N E M E N T
Pentameters Theatre
29 May 1998
B
e warned, y o u might have
trouble finding The
Pentameters Theatre
London's first ever fringe theatre. It
is in H a m p s t e a d , above a pub, and
is very small. Be careful where y o u
put your feet - the actors may
tread on y o u as there is no stage as
such and the whole place is literal-
ly about ten-foot square!
This unusual intimacy makes for
a very absorbing experience and
you'll feel like y o u are actually part
of the action. The story is about the
unlikely friendship b e t w e e n
Steinberg, an elderly Jewish teacher
and Frances Bourne a mother and
PTA member w h o has forced his
compulsory retirement. It explores
the differences between his reli-
gious old-fashioned views and her
modern, secular ones. A s Steinberg
disapprovingly puts it, she goes to
synagogue, "once a year and w h e n
she's there she talks about her job,
car and family holidays" while he is
god-fearing and devout. She visits
the retired Steinberg to apologise
for what she's done and following
Jewish doctrine, he must forgive
her, or this will be viewed as c o m -
mitting a sin just as great. Being a
man of integrity and religious devo-
tion, he duly does so, and a strong
friendship develops between them.
The characters' opinion of each
other (and indeed the audience's
opinion) changes dramatically as
they b e c o m e confidants. H e start-
ed as a stuffy, blinkered and cruel
old man and she as an ignorant,
rash 'rich bitch' and both became
c o m p a s s i o n a t e , intelligent and
insightful people. Steinberg's feel-
ings change, however, in a more
significant way. Tormenting himself
over his 'sin' he starts having night-
mares, which we see integrated
cleverly a n d s m o o t h l y into his
monologues.
There are only six characters
and even fewer props. A few chairs
and a bookcase were used in a vari-
ety of ingenious and often humor-
ous ways to let us know what's
going o n . A lot of imagination is
required on the part of the audi-
ence but in fact this makes it more
striking.
All of the characters are essen-
tially a little caricatured and include
the headmaster, a decent, if cow-
ardly m a n , a n d the naive and
extremely c o m i c school secretary.
As well as being thought provoking
and intelligent the play is very witty
and thoroughly enjoyable.
Steinberg's Day of Atonement is a
moving and sensitive play and you
don't have to be religious to get
something out of it.

cones - it's only running until June

fter a great battle, a friend of
mine finally managed to get
tickets for this sell out play
starring Juliette B i n o c h e . M y
expectations were quite high since
it had been hyped up so m u c h .
And I must a d d that I wasn't disap-
pointed at all.
The play is about a y o u n g
w o m a n Ersilia w h o is taken care of
by an older man, a novelist, as she
comes out of hospital. W e later
find out that she was in the news-
papers and that the novelist is try-
ing to write a fictional account of
her life. From there on, w e witness
what has happened to her. Various
men appear: her fiance, her lover
(a married man) and the journalist
that interviewed her for the news-
paper article. They all exploit her
and she clearly c o m e s across as
the victim all through the play. A s
we get further into the story w e
find out that Ersilia tried to c o m m i t
suicide.
Pirandello has created a w o n -
derful confrontation between one
w o m a n and the m e n in her life w h o
are trying to help her, although in
the end it feels like they have
destroyed her. The paradox is that
even if Ersilia appears the victim, in
the end she triumphs and leaves an
enormous m e s s in these men's
lives: she successfully c o m m i t s sui-
cide in the last scene of the play.
The four m e n have to live forever
with this tragedy o n their minds
and consciences. Another interest-
ing character is Onoria, the novel-
ist's landlady w h o dismisses Ersilia
at first as a prostitute, then, as she
finds out the y o u n g w o m a n was in
the papers, becomes very kind to
her and right at the end turns
against her w h e n the truth finally
c o m e s out. It feels like Onoria is
the voice of the people, and reacts
just like most of us d o nowadays.
Jonathan Kent's direction is
spotless, he does a perfect job with
his actors. H e gives the play a lot of
energy and the design adds a lot of
power to the performances.
All of the actors are very g o o d ,
Juliette Binoche in particular, of
course, giving a splendid perfor-
mance not too far from her film
roles ("Three Colours: Blue", "Les
Amants du Pont-NeuP). She gives
all she has in her to Ersilia's charac-
ter, although she can sometimes
be hard to understand. Oliver Ford
Davies as N o t a the novelist is fan-
tastic and very funny. The other
members of the cast are also very
g o o d .
Overall this is a great night out
for theatre lovers and will please
Binoche's fans.
It is definitely worth all the
queuing

T
he Barbican Centre has just
kicked off a new festival,
BITE:98, an international the-
atre event w i t h collaboration
between two brilliant artists, Robert
Wilson and Philip Glass. To place
these people a little: Robert Wilson
is a major American theatre direc-
tor w h o has worked extensively
over the world; Philip Glass is one
of the most important and innova-
tive contemporary composers hav-
ing written the famous "music in 12
parts". His most recent work is the
music for Martin Scorsese's film
Kundun. Wilson and Glass have
already collaborated in 1976, pro-
ducing a groundbreaking work at
the time, Einstein on the Beach.
Monsters of Grace is a fusion of
13th century Sufi devotional songs
with 3D animations, all this to the
sound of Glass's music. H e uses
quite a few traditional Persian
instruments (mostly sampled) but
his style is instantly recognisable.
There were 13 scenes in total,
seven of which were 3D animated,
where we all had to wear our little
3D glasses to watch. It was all pret-
ty impressive: lots of movement,
although things didn't always make
sense. There was use of geometri-
cal figures, everyday settings,
houses and forests, and one partic-
ularly amazing piece: a man's hand
being filmed from all angles and
then being cut open at the palm.
The other scenes were acted out
by five adults and a very y o u n g boy.
Not m u c h was actually happening
but emotionally it was all very
strong and visually it was arresting-
ly beautiful. The director u s e d
things like an aquarium, a gigantic
piece of turquoise cloth wrapped
around a w o m a n , which had a
most stunning effect.
The little boy seemed to play a
central part as he walked across
the stage into a closed off changing
r o o m . The animations then started
and right at the end he walked out .
of the enclosed r o o m back to
where he first was.
The direction was perfect, giving
the actors the m a x i m u m of space
to express themselves, free from
the "dictatorship" of words. This is
so exhilarating to watch: the ani-
mations are superb a n d Philip
Glass's music is simply divine. His
fans won't be disappointed and
n e w c o m e r s will fall under the
charm of that beauty.
This collaboration is a masterpiece
and has s h o w n new directions for
t h e a t r e / p e r f o r m a n c e / m u s i c
crossovers. This is the stuff of the
future, in a different w a y to
C l e a n s e d but with the s a m e
impact: one feels this is a revela-
tion.
The future looks bright if these guys
influence u p c o m i n g artists.
