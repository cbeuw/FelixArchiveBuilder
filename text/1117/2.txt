Residents Say No
to Diana Memorial
ED SEXTON
Over 250 Kensington and Chelsea
residents demanded that plans
for a 'Diana memorial garden' are
scrapped at a public meeting last
Tuesday evening.
The garden of remembrance for
Diana, Princess of Wales, has been
planned since last year; the Royal
Parks Agency sub-
mitted proposals to
a government c o m -
mittee last
D e c e m b e r .
Although exact
details have yet to
be finalised, the gar-
den is thought to
consist of sixteen
acres of flowerbeds
and walkways within
the g r o u n d s of
Kensington Palace.
A special garden for
children and areas for leaving per-
sonal tributes [toilets? -Ed] are like-
ly to feature a m o n g the attractions.
The plans came under attack at
a special public m e e t i n g in
Kensington Town Hall on Tuesday
evening. M o s t residents, r e m e m -
bering the chaos caused in the area
last September w h e n Kensington
Palace b e c a m e an i m p r o m p t u
shrine, fear that the garden will
attract thousands of tourists and
thus increase traffic and pollution
in what is already a congested
area. Art critic Brian Sewell, one of
m a n y celebrity residents of
Kensington, c o m m e n t e d to the
B B C that "the garden will be
tacky... simply a focus for silly
tourists". These 'silly tourists'
could reach numbers of five million
people a year. Alan Clark, M P for
Kensington and Chelsea, was less
c o n d e m n i n g in his
comments, but did
complain that infor-
m a t i o n w a s not
readily available con-
cerning the garden's
design.
The nature and
use of Diana's m e m -
ory in memorials and
commercial projects
are not exactly new
issues. O n l y this
w e e k a British
w o m a n set up five
'Diana M e m o r i a l Tours', designed
to take visitors by coach around
the sites of London that featured
most in the Princess' life, including
her favourite shops and gymnasi-
um. The c o m p a n y was set up with
the approval of the London Tourist
Board: If the planned memorial
garden goes ahead, Kensington
High Street will have m u c h more to
worry about than five extra
coaches.
Alan Clark is not amused
News in Brief...
A TEST OF PURE
EciSMTtww
A new ecstasy testing kit,
designed to test the purity of the
illegal drug, has c o m e under
heavy criticism from the drugs
czar Keith Hellawell. The test,
which will be available to the gen-
eral public, detects the presence
of several chemicals in tablets,
including M D M A , and provides
information c o n c e r n i n g the
effects of the drug.
Keith Hellawell, speaking on
BBC Radio 4's Today Programme,
called the test "a step too far",
claiming that even pure ecstasy
damaged all parts of the system.
He was also of the opinion that
users took other drugs to counter-
act the effects of ecstasy, and
that the kit would encourage drug
use.
Tony Puglio, one of the kit's
inventors, dismissed these claims,
pointing out that such a kit could
save lives. A s yet no research has
shown conclusively that M D M A
causes long or short term d a m -
age, and many of the arguments
both for and against use of the
d r u g are based o n mere
speculation.

Brabazon Basement Falls Foul of the Floods
CLARE ASHWIN
Residents of Brabazon House,
one of the Charing Cross halls of
residence in Pimlico, had their
dedicated revision schedule inter-
rupted on Tuesday when the
basement level of the building
flooded due to the heavy rains.
O n e of the students returned to
his r o o m in the middle of the after-
noon to find a large volume of
water outside his d o o r . U p o n
opening the bathroom door, he
found water gushing from the over-
flowing toilets. The water spread
quickly and residents o n upstairs
floors were rounded up to help
basement residents evacuate their
rooms.
It soon became a race against
time to empty the contents of the
seven rooms affected by the flood.
C o m p u t e r e q u i p m e n t , clothing,
textbooks, C D players and files of
notes began to pile up in the base-
ment library, but it became appar-
ent that the library too was in dan-
ger of becoming submerged. The
transfer of items to higher floors
became a priority as belongings
were hurriedly thrown into bags.
Empty rooms on the floor above
were o p e n e d up and used as
deposit points. The water was
thrown up by the drainage system,
unable to cope with the heavy rain-
fall. Water levels almost reached
the height of the windowsills out-
side and it was feared that the
water w o u l d start to c o m e in
through the windows if the rain
continued. Sandbags and piles of
sheets were used as barriers
around the doors but to no avail.
Nicholas Waters, the first resi-
dent to discover the flood, was dis-
mayed to see his carpet floating.
Residents not in the building w h e n
the flooding occurred returned to
find their belongings scattered
around the hall and their bedrooms
ankle deep in drain water. The flow
of water headed towards the boiler
r o o m , fracturing hot water pipes
under the pressure and leaving res-
idents throughout the building
without hot water. The electricity
failed but was later restored to the
upper floors of the building. A
team arrived to p u m p the water
f r o m the f l o o d e d basement.
Students affected were placed in
temporary rooms and left to locate
their scattered belongings and
assess the damage. "Welcome to
Brabazon aquarium" c o m m e n t e d
one student.
