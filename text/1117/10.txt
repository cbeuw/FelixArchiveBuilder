10 INTERVIEW 29
the electric c,a $
Jeff Mills has long been described as the most
important name in techno. His DJ sets incorpo-
rate the deft use of u p to sixty records an hour.
People use the w o r d ' g o d ' to describe the musi-
cal abilities of this man. Yet d e e p d o w n he feels
it is all about depth a n d a sort of spirituality. ]eff
is o n a mission, yet he claims not to know w h y
he does what he does. I had a rare opportunity
to talk to the m a n behind the myth...
For people reading who don't know who
you are, can you explain who you are and
what you do with music.
I'm originally from Detroit a n d I make elec-
tronic music for a living...as an art. I create. I've
also been DJing for seventeen, eighteen years.
Can you describe your DJing style for peo-
ple who're listening? How you like to express
yourself...
It's like a collage of music within a certain
time frame. So what y o u hear is not the c o m -
plete full length of the c o m p o s i t i o n but maybe
parts of it, at times.
So you're putting things over each other to
create a sort of layered-effect?
Yes. Like painting which is a collage of
colours.
Why do you choose to express yourself
with electronic instruments?
It's the most convenient w a y for m e to be
able to lay d o w n the idea. I'm not a musician
where I've studied to play the guitar or the
piano so 1 use a different type of vehicle to cre-
ate music.
A lot of electronic musicians choose to
become DJs. How was that for you?
I started off as a DJ a n d over time I began to
understand, after listening to so many records
for so long, that maybe I should try to begin to
make music myself. So I did a n d for having such
a long background in playing music 1 found it
quite easy to make it. O n c e y o u learn simply
how to make it, then y o u can figure out h o w to
manipulate it a n d have it d o things that y o u
want it to d o or make the machines d o exactly
what y o u want them to d o . So that w a s the
process.
You say that you could make the machines
do exactly what you wanted them to do. Do
you think that you've made tracks where you
could step back and say, "Yes. This is exactly
what 1 wanted to express with this track!"?
Yes. M a n y . M a n y of t h e m .
Can you explain some of the things that
you have expressed through your music?
Well I think first y o u have to have an idea
before y o u sit d o w n t o make music. Then y o u
know eventually where an e n d is. Because you'll
hear it a n d then you'll say, " O K that's it a n d I'm
finished with it." If y o u have n o idea then of
course you'll never understand where the e n d is.
What usually happens is that I'll have an idea of
a concept or a place or a person. That is the
basis of the release. The individual tracks are the
elements that make up the release itself. That's
when I begin to break d o w n from colour to
sound; from depth to s o u n d . I relay all these
things to sound.
Is it easy to translate these things from
different media?
It is easy if y o u construct your o w n scale.
Like for m e red is hot; high frequency. Blue is
cool. Black is very low, subsonic frequencies. So
if y o u create your o w n scale then yes it is easy.
And there isn't just one scale. That's the cre-
ation of the producer.
If you made a record based on a concept
that you had imagined and you played it to
me and I interpreted something different
from it, then would you be disappointed?
N o . M y main purpose is that y o u heard it
and y o u had a reaction. That y o u were m o v e d in
s o m e way, whether it w a s negative or positive,
the fact is that it affected y o u s o m e h o w .
Are you ever interested in what other peo-
ple saw in your records? Or do you just want
to see them being moved?
Indirectly. Because I would not want that to
affect m e the next time I sit d o w n to make
music.
So would that affect you?
It might. A n d I'm usually afraid of that. For
example w h e n someone c o m e s up and says
" W o w ! You're the best DJ a n d blah blah blah."
Even if they all came back to you, not one
sold? Wouldn't that mean something to you?
Wouldn't that affect you in some way?
It would make it more difficult for m e to put
out the next record, but it doesn't mean that I
would not put out the next record.
But would you not feel that if no one was
buying it, no one was liking it?
That w a s never really the case. I mean there
have been many releases, or I've made releases
that I've never released because I felt that I d i d -
n't need to release it. I actually made white
labels of Cycle 30 a n d gave those to DJs and
after I'd given out fifty copies I felt that the job
was done a n d I came very close to not releas-
ing that release.
Why did you feel that over something that
you have actually released?
It w a s a conceptual release. It w a s based o n
the thirty year cycle that w e as humans live in.
This cycle where things regurgitate over years;
fashion, trends, political situations a n d every-
thing. I got a very early indication, just from the
DJs a n d the producers that really wanted to
hear this.
It w a s almost as if I'd c o m e up with a theo-
ry and just needed the right people to hear it so
that they might create something similar to it.
That's another way to release music. To release
an idea. So not to release it directly from the
person to people, but from the person to
another person a n d then t o the people.
When you're DJing you're creating a col-
lage. Are you trying to create this piece of art
single-mindedly or are you just thinking,
"Well they want to dance, so I'll make them
dance."?
N o . Those elements, the dance elements
c o m e second in the Axis material. The idea
c o m e s first, then the structure a n d then 1 feel I
should make it danceable. So it actually comes
second or maybe third. In the Purpose Maker
material it c o m e s number one.
Can you tell us a bit about the designs you
use on the Purpose Maker releases?
The logo is a hand in the gesture of either
giving or receiving. That's basically why I created
the label; to give this music for Djs to use. That's
why this music w a s designed, not to be Top 4 0
hits, but just as a very g o o d solid track that y o u
could play in between those popular tracks. A n d
as I produced the first release I discovered that
many DJs used them for the same reason, that
there w a s a g a p at that time, that y o u couldn't
even buy this type of music because people just
weren't making t h e m . So I decided to make
very simple compositions for that reason. That's
where the title came from, "I'm making this title
for a purpose, a n d I'm giving it to y o u . A n d it's
your hand that is receiving."
Do you also feel that it's a form of com-
munication? Where 1 come from the hand is a
symbol of communication in Indian and ori-
ental dance, and gestures can be used to
communicate whole stories. Do you see it as
a form of communicating without language?
Sure. I only speak English and...OK, a little
bit of French! 1 find it really difficult, as 1 travel,
to communicate with people. It's almost impos-
sible to relay m y true feelings. In s o m e lan-
guages it's almost t o o difficult to describe
something because in English w e may not have
the words. In Japanese for example they have
many subtle meanings for w o r d s that w e don't
even have. O u r language is very simple so I think
that as communications b e c o m e more frequent
1998 INTERVIEW 11
t a l k s t o Jeff M i l l s
- in other words s o m e o n e from India can talk to
someone from Spain in a matter of seconds -
that language might b e c o m e t o o m u c h of a nui-
sance to communicate in the future, that it
might be easier to create a completely different
language. So I thought that maybe just using
images without any information exceeds more
language barriers.
The logo w a s actually the start of it. A n d I
began to apply that in many other ways.
Looking at these images there is nothing right or
wrong about them. It's not like if y o u look at a
Van Gogh painting a n d an art expert c o m e s up
and says, 'Yes the landscape means this, a n d
blah, blah, blah!" That means that what I thought
was wrong. So it becomes a little too difficult,
trying to determine what is right or wrong, so
let's just d o away with that. Believe what y o u
believe a n d that's it!"
I think maybe that's the reason w h y techno
music, without vocals, goes so far so fast a n d
hits so many people so quickly. Y o u listen to it
and y o u like it or you don't like it, a n d that's that.
You create your art, your collage, in night-
clubs. Would you ever consider taking a dif-
ferent style of records and creating different
types of canvasses in other types of situa-
tions?
Yeah I have. I've m a d e music for industrial
c o m m e r c i a l s , small films, b a c k d r o p m u s i c ,
music for no reason or main purpose at all but
just for...well I'm lucky enough to have m y stu-
dio in my h o m e . I live in a gigantic r o o m , to cre-
ate music just for the day. I get u p early in the
morning after eating breakfast a n d I make
something that just plays throughout the day. I
keep it going continuously while I'm working or
making m y b e d or taking a shower. It's just
something that I hear w h e n I want to hear it.
What happens at the end of the day?
1 turn it off a n d I lose it. A n d it's just the
music for that day. It's just for m e . If you're
lucky enough to make music a n d have it in the
same place where y o u live y o u can d o this.
1 read you were once an architect.
I w a s studying.
Does this kind of use of structure and
form and light come into what you are doing
today? Could you describe yourself maybe as
a sound architect?
Difficult for m e to determine that.
Do you think that sound can change the
appearance of an interior or surrounding, not
superficially but in your mind's eye? As if you
were translating colour into sound...
Yeah sure. It's the application of elevator
music. They d o that for a reason. It's to make
you calm after that terrible meeting. It could be
like, say, ambient music which has a really great
application if it were applied. 1 think in years it
probably will be. It's designed for a specific pur-
pose a n d that's to make y o u calm d o w n .
If you were on tour and you had the same
bag of records, and you went to two clubs on
two consecutive nights would you play a dif-
ferent type of set based on the layout and
size or appearance of the club?
N o . Usually it's based o n the people. The
type of people that they are; h o w many m e n ,
h o w many w o m e n ; h o w many people are sitting
around the wall; h o w many people are in the
back; h o w many people are actually dancing.
So if many people were sitting around the
wall would you dare them to dance? Would
you be more aggressive or would you start off
slowly?
Slowly because they're waiting for some-
thing. Also h o w hot it is; what the humidity is
like; the distance from the DJ booth to the peo-
ple; the type of lighting. This all happens as I'm
walking from the door to the booth in a matter
of minutes.
I never forget that the people paid to get in
and they paid to have a g o o d time. That's num-
ber one. A n d then what I would like to play for
them comes second. I'm only there because the
people asked m e to be there. So I need to make
them feel comfortable as quickly as possible. So
I need to let them know that it's O K to c o m e to
the dancefloor. I think over years y o u just begin
to know people and h o w they act a n d club life.
Do you think there are people who are
capable of liking your music but are afraid of
the term techno. Maybe it produces a nega-
tive image in their mind. Do you know how to
take the music out to those people?
I think there's a lot of misconception about
what it is in the media. Y'know techno is this
hard noise. What it is...it's the process of trying
to create something that is in the future. Some
type of feeling. It's not necessarily music of the
future, but it's the process of trying to create
something. So what you're hearing is y o u n g
people trying to make something that is of
tomorrow.
So this process is really unclear. It's really
difficult t o define exactly what techno is
because we're still trying. W e ' r e still trying to
define exactly what the structure is. It's not a
909 drum machine, it's not a 3 0 3 sound. W e
thought it w a s that. It's not a 8 0 8 . That's actu-
ally what techno is. It's the process of trying to
make future music.
From the records you've listened to, say
ten years ago, how close do you think they
came to what we have now (ie what is the
future for them)?
Yes s o m e people were right o n the money.
Computer world! Y'know? Pocket calculator.
S o m e people were off, s o m e people were o n .
Look at s o m e movies. I watched 2001 Space
O d y s e e last night: Stanley Kubrik w a s on the
money.
In your personal opinion, do you think
that one day people who learn about the his-
tory of music might learn about jazz artists
such as Miles Davis, and then follow straight
on to techno-jazz artists such as Carl Craig
who aren't really accepted jazz musicians at
present?
Sure. 1 think the situation is that w e need
more time for us to get older a n d then get in a
position to be able to preserve the things that
w e loved w h e n w e were younger. It's t o o soon
for us to d o that. The music is still too new. W h o
will be remembered a n d w h o won't? I can think
of s o m e people...
You say that you are fuelled by emotion,
yet music made by computers is often criti-
cised as cold and emotionless. Don't you
think it strange that we use computers which
are logical machines to convey our emotions?
It's not the machines that make the music.
It's the person. It's just like an ink pen or a type-
writer. Y o u can write using a typewriter, but it's
the words that y o u type that create the emotion
not the typewriter. In other w o r d s it's h o w y o u
use the equipment. The machine doesn't have a
brain. It can't think, at lease not yet. It's just a
tool with wires or knobs. If y o u have a bad idea,
the equipment will relay your bad idea; if y o u
have a brilliant idea and y o u use it correctly then
it's done!
How do you stay focused?
It's easy. I know which direction I'm going in.
I know I'm going to make electronic music for
my life; not house, not reggae but techno. So I
can run faster because I k n o w the things that I
need to be able to g o o n this road. I know that
1 need a studio so I can make the music faster,
I know that I need to travel so 1 can see as many
people as possible, I know that, with every new
release, I need to think differently, I know I need
to keep u p with what is n e w in the world in
terms of trends a n d technology a n d fashion and
the w a y people think. So I k n o w the things that
are of interest in m y career or craft.
al;ck.
