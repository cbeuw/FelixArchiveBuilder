ALBUM & LIVE
E A R L BRUTUS
Tonight You Are the Special One
E
arl Brutus sure ain't pretty,
they play d e m e n t e d g l a m
rock mixed in with spacey
electro effects, and are unlikely to
be invited d o w n for tea at
number ten. Their lyrics
c o u l d be optimistically
described as incomprehen-
sible, a machine gun suc-
cession of supermarket
anarchist soundbites,
bawled over the c r a z e d
glam guitars that forms the
meat of their music. This
album is the follow up to
their 96 debut album Your
Majesty... We are Here.
The first track, The SAS
and the Clam that goes
with it, blasts out its cho-
rus "You are your o w n reaction"
over the guitar rock and twisted
soundscape of a joblot of Dr W h o
effects, while The Universal Plan
exclaims "It's a beautiful w o r l d "
over throbbing stadium rock work
and a Gary Numanesque keyboard
refrain. Both great anthems which
are perfect for the moshpit.
However, although there are
drums. This wouldn't necessarily be
a bad thing, but the songs lack the
m o m e n t u m required to carry the
listener through a whole album of
the bawling pub rock, and
the slower songs God, Let
me be Kind with its minimal-
ist beats, and the gentle
Don't Die Jim, aren't enough
to provide relief from the
g l a m p u b p u n k d r u n k e n -
brawlinginacarparkstadium-
some wild and wonderful intros -
the church organ solo of Second
Class War, and the Sixties superspy
music in Edelweiss, in almost every
case they are quickly buried under
the heavy guitars and stomping
rock.
All in all the album lacks
H H the innovation of their
"" debut, and while individual
tracks such as 99p a n d
Come Taste my Mind w o u l d
make excellent live tracks
and singles, there is not
quite enough variety in their unique
brand of stodgy glam to make this
album an essential purchase.

URUSEI YATSURA
Live at the LA2 • • •
U
rusei Yatsura aren't your usual rock
band. They are a Glaswegian fOur-piece
obsessed by Japanese junk culture and
tigers. Roughly translated as 'noisy stars' or
'obnoxious aliens', Urusei Yatsura was one of
the most popular anime series produced, a
frankly bizarre s h o w starring one L u m - an beau-
tiful alien sporting horns and a tiger-skin bikini.
It all starts to fit together...
The LA2 was surprisingly packed out for a
band that has only just made it into London's
musical c o n s c i o u s n e s s . C l u m p s of twenty-
something men are swigging away on their
Budweisers and paying token attention to the
support Apples in Stereo. At least half of these
must be music 'journalists'. Between the affect-
edly cool musos run the real fans - overexcited
fourteen year-old teeny boppers. A pair of
absurdly enthusiastic girlies bounce up to us,
feather boas flying. Their voices are just audible
over a terrible Beach Boys cover - "Buy our
Fanzine! Buy our Fanzine!"
The support were duly kicked off, and after
the usual faffing a n d false starts, Yatsura
stormed on and thrashed out a deafening rendi-
tion of Flaming Skull. They s e e m e d to be getting
the duller songs out of the way first, and despite
the volume, they weren't carrying the c r o w d
with them.
Suddenly, everyone recognises the opening
chords of Glo Stars and the moshing starts.
Pogoing around like a lunatic while five-foot-five
boppers crack repeatedly into the bottom of
your chin and the D M s of smelly sixth-formers
smack you squarely in the temples as they surf
the towards the stage; all in the name of fun.
A n d what fun it is. The mini-mosh pit is friendly
but fast, and the two security guards have their
work cut out dealing with the crowd surfers.
The band hammer out the favourites, p o w -
ering through the joyous Hello Tiger with
impressive force. Guitarist G r a h a m ' s sonic
secrets are revealed in Exidor - he takes two
drum sticks, weaves one between the strings,
and clobbers it with the other.
The c r o w d , however, have other ideas.
"SIAMESE!" they d e m a n d . Eventually, the band
agree, and thrash out a rendition of this early
favourite with such force that it's barely recog-
nisable. Ears p o p , light bulbs smash, and we
j u m p higher and higher loving the torture.
Graham is banging away like a m a d m a n , appar-
ently unsatisfied until he's broken all the strings.
Suddenly, they desert the stage, leaving the
instruments howling a demonic, ear-shattering
wail that matching the growing pain in my head.
It's madness - we're shouting for more, but no-
one can hear, not even ourselves.
Slowly it dawns o n us that there will be no
encore. Although it's just 10.30pm, Urusei
Yatsura have left the building. The massive wail-
ing gradually subsides to a manageable cacoph-
ony, and the party's over like a burst balloon.
Noisy Stars they may be, but they're nice
enough not to keep their diminutive fans up
after their bed-time.
