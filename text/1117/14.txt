Legs. What else do you expect
from a musical about prosti-
tutes.
L
ast year, I had what was
undoubtedly my finest hour,
standing in a very short pink
dress and knee length boots, hold-
ing a sign, with my friends in the
audience shouting and whistling at
me, whilst a spotlight flashed on
me. The reason for this particular
piece of exhibitionism w a s the
1997 O p S o c production of Sweet
Charity, a stunning performance by
all concerned, with s o m e amazing
acting from yours truly. So it was
with great excitement, and some
trepidation that I cycled madly up
the Chelsea Embankment to see
the n e w p r o d u c t i o n of Sweet
Charity at the Victoria Palace
Theatre.
Written in the sixties, this musi-
cal charts the history of Charity
H o p e Valentine as she falls in love,
falls flat on her face, gets pushed
into the lake in Central Park, falls in
love, meets a band of dope-smok-
ing evangelists, leaves her job as a
dance-hall hostess, and gets
pushed into the lake again. The
script was adapted by Neil Simon
from a film by Frederico Fellini,
called "Le notte di Calabria", or "The
Nights of Calabria", about a prosti-
tute w h o looks for love on street
corners, the music was written by
Cy C o l e m a n , and the lyrics by
Dorothy Fields. The musical has
faintly satirical tones, with a lot of
jokes against the film stars of the
time, especially the stars of trashy
romantic c o m e d i e s . There is a
hilarious scene where Charity
bumps into a rapidly fading B-
movie Romeo, and ends up in his
closet, watching him make love to
his girlfriend. H e sings a ballad
called "Too M a n y T o m o r r o w s " ,
which on the surface appears to be
an ordinary, slightly sickly song, but
when taken in context, b e c o m e s
highly ironical.
This production, directed by
Carol Metcalf, stars Bonnie
Langford as the hapless Charity,
and as predicted, she is in fine
voice, and dances with exuberance
and great skill. In their microscopic
dresses and perilously high heels,
the other Fandango B a l l r o o m
Dancers show off their powerful
voices and impossibly long legs
with great aplomb, snarling and
y a w n i n g their way through "Big
Spender", and dancing aloofly to
"The Rich Man's Frug" in very little
black dresses.
It is important to remember
that this s h o w is fun, and is not
meant to be taken at all seriously. It
is entertainment of a superior qual-
ity. G o on, blow the last remnants
of your student loan on a trip to see
this; if y o u like silly shows without
much plot, but with great dancing,
singing, peerless choreography and
an ability to have you leaving the
theatre singing and floating, then
y o u will love this.
W i t h traffic-stopping songs
such as "Big Spender", "If M y
Friends Could See M e Now", "I
Love to Cry At Weddings" and "Too
M a n y T o m o r r o w s " , this s h o w
deserves to be as successful as any
of A n d r e w Lloyd-Webber's irony-
free, saccharine musicals.

LARRY'S PARTY

T
his is the book that w o n the
Orange Prize this year. It's
really, really g o o d . I recom-
mend it to everyone, it is a w o n -
derful, thoughtful and enjoyable
book. W e watch the hero, Larry J.
Weller, grow up from a y o u n g man
in his twenties to a late forty-some-
thing, and chart his life, through his
two marriages, the birth of his son
to his c o m a and his eventual recov-
ery, via his obsession for mazes. As
a young man, he took Floral Studies
at college, and ended up working
for Flowerworld in Toronto, where
he'd lived all his life. O n his first
honeymoon, he and Dorrie went to
Hampton Court, and it was here
that Larry's love of mazes was
born. After his divorce, he took a
course in Garden Design, m o v e d to
Chicago, started his o w n company,
remarried and was happy. Then,
his wife m o v e d to England, as
H e a d of W o m e n ' s Studies at
Sussex, and they divorced. H e then
met Carol, and to celebrate both
his ex-wives visiting Chicago at the
same time, they throw a party.
Put like this, it doesn't s e e m at
all extraordinary. What sets it apart
f r o m the other entries is the
humanity and quality of the writing.
Larry is a real man,- you can see
him, ambling along in his old Harris
tweed jacket, digging up shrubs
with loving care, sitting around the
family table with his mother and
father, feeling uncomfortable at
large parties, walking up to you in
the street and saying "Hi". Knowing
him, I now feel that I have a much
better idea of men in general, of
their anxieties and the angst they
can suffer at certain ages. I loved
this book, it is the perfect antithe-
sis to the inelegant and careless
prose of writers such as Enrico
Brizzi and that awful Lana Citron
(Felix 1114). It deserved to win the
prize, and I hope the author gains
more publicity through this book, I
can't wait for her next one.
Ciulia Sometimes
Ann Patchett
W
hat happens to the assis-
tant after the magician
dies? W h e n she's loved
him for twenty-two years, been
vanished by him, sawed in half,
made to hang in mid-air and had
him pull rabbits out of her cleav-
age, does she just hang up her
sparkly dress, put her tights in stor-
age and get on with her life some-
how? W h e n Parsifal the Great
magician dies of a brain aneurysm,
two years after his lover Phan dies
of AIDS, Sabine is left stranded.
Suddenly, she gets a letter from
their lawyer, explaining that Parsifal
was o n c e G u y Fetters from
Alliance, Nebraska, and his mother
and two sisters want to meet her,
his w i d o w . Shocked, but weary,
Sabine welcomes Parsifal's family
into her home, and gradually realis-
es that only through these people
she can get to know the man she
loved. W h e n they return to
Nebraska, she follows them, and
learns the reasons behind Guy's
transformation to Parsifal and why
he depended on her, with the help
of his faithful lover, the delicate
Vietnamese Phan.
Another book o n the Orange
prize shortlist, this is a sensitive
and delicately written novel, with
just the right balance of wit and
c o m p a s s i o n . The tragic w i d o w
Sabine, a wife and yet not a wife, is
depicted as a strong w o m a n , from
a loving family, w h o fell in love with
a m a n w h o loved m e n , and
became his right hand w o m a n ,
loved and trusted by him. Her
growing awareness of her o w n abil-
ity to perform the magic tricks,
card-tricks, pulling eggs from peo-
ple's ears and her instant accep-
tance into the family she never
knew Parsifal had had, help her to
cope with life without him, particu-
larly as his sister, Kitty, is almost his
d o u b l e . This is an extremely
thoughtful n o v e l , poignant and
evocative; the beautiful description
of the flatness of Nebraska, and the
contrast with Los Angeles bring up
familiar images of differences
between the places in my life. I
really enjoyed this book and I rec-
o m m e n d it to all displaced persons
and everyone w h o likes to see life
from a wider viewpoint.
