Xn the n a m e of Allah, H o s t S r a e t o u s , f l o s t n e r c t / u l .
When the Earth is shaken to its (utmost)
convulsion,
And the Earth throws up
Its burdens (from within),
And man cries (distressed);
'What is the matter with it?'
On that Day will it declare its tidings:
For that thy Lord will
Have given it inspiration.
On that Day will men proceed in companies sorted
out,
To be shown the Deeds
That they (had done).
Then shall anyone who
Has done an atom's weight of good, see it!
And anyone who
Has done an atom's weight of evil, see it!
