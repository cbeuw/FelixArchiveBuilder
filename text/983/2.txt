Unexpected Week-long Nursery Closure
BY SHAUN JOYNSON
Imperial College students and staff
have breathed a sigh of relief on
learning that the College Nursery in
Princes Gardens is to re-open
today, Friday 10th December.
The Nursery was closed with
less than one day's notice on Friday
3rd December after a series of
disagreements between staff led to
what the Director of Personnel and
Administrative Services, Caroline
Fox, called a 'breakdown in
communications'.
The disagreements, which began
earlier this year, have led to a
number of staff threatening to
resign. These disagreements appear
to be personality clashes rather than
conflicts in teaching styles and
centre on one or two members from
a total staff of around half a dozen.
The Nursery cares for staff
children as well as children of
students and has been in operation
at the College for a number of
years. It is paid for mainly by
parental contributions, with some
subsidy from the Union and
College authorities.
Caroline Fox said that the deci-
sion to close the Nursery had been
taken because, had the resignations
threatened by staff gone ahead, the
Nursery would have had an
insufficient number of experienced
staff. "We did look at the
possibility of using agency staff,
but there were none available," she
said.
Despite the staff problems, Ms
Fox is adamant that the children's
care was not affected. "Nurseries
are strictly controlled under the
1989 Children Act, which stipulates
that the children must be under
continuous supervision at all times.
Our aim is now, and has always
been, to put child care first and if
there had been insufficient number
of staff to ensure this, then we
would not have opened," she told
Felix.
She added that she would be
taking a conciliatory line with staff
and trying to sort the matters out to
everyone's satisfaction. Wpxried—
parents^getfrered' at a meeting on
Wednesday and were told of the
rather than just one single
occurrence.
Ms Fox does, however, believe
that the staff can sort out these
problems given time: "Parents bond

J tT|ngly with individual staff
members that work in the Nursery.
Many haye come back after mater-
probleras and of the, effor^ beirig 1 nity leavl with their first child. We

thing seefns to Jjai£sJ»pp€^d'tfr'
once," sai*d Ms Fox. "We've had an
expansion in the facilities occurring
at the same time as new buildings
have come into use."
In addition to these changes,
Felix has learned that there have
been changes to procedures in the
Nursery and some staff believe that
matters have been brought to a
head by a combination of events,
do have afvery strong community."
Christmas Caper Success
This year's Christmas Caper took
place in the College last Sunday
and Joe McFadden went along to
find out more. The Caper was
organised by the H U B Office and
aimed to introduce children to the
fun and excitement that science and
technology can offer.
Craft stalls, science demon-
strations and games took place in
the Sherfield Ante-Room and Main
Dining Hall. There was also a
'Science Shop' held in the Senior
Common Room.
Demonstrations and hands-on
experiments were run by Imperial
College staff and students. There
was also a show by Science
Museum staff based on the popular
'Launch Pad' format.
Children had the chance to see a
cat's-eye view of the world, learn
about human hearing and the
physics of music, have fun with
bubbles and watch an explosive
demonstration by the Chemistry
department. Other activities
included face-painting, 'Reindeer
Racing' and making Christmas
decorations. Volunteers from
Imperial College's tutoring scheme,
the Pimlico Connection acted as
guides for everyone coming to the
Caper. These and other students
Take four hundred andfifty children and two hundred adults.
Mix with various craft stalls and science experiments and
stir the whole concoction for three hours.
Does this sound like a recipe for a nervous breakdown?
from the College also helped run
some of the stalls. Those who went
along included families of College
staff and children from local
schools.
The H U B Office would like to
thank everyone who helped on the
day or provided materials for any
of the activities.

Closure?
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
AND ANDREW TSENG
The fate of Charing Cross and
Hammersmith Hospitals could be
decided by Christmas following
increased speculation this week.
It has been rumoured that
Virginia Bottomley, Health Sec-
retary, will announce the merger of
both hospitals and the closure of
the Hammersmith Hospital before
the end of the winter festivities. It
would mark the reshaping of
London's health services.
Should an announcement be
made, it is expected that Hammer-
smith Hospital will be closed. Staff
and services would then be moved
to Charing Cross. This would
become a specialist hospital
providing cancer treatment and
other services for West London.
The Royal Marsden and St Barthol-
omews are also under threat, with
predicted losses of at least 1,000
beds. It has also been suggested
that the Royal Marsden will be
relocated to Surrey.
However, any relocation could
jeopardise the 'Chelsea Medical
Sciences Centre'. The centre was
proposed by Ms Bottomley in her
reply to a report on London
medicine by Sir Bernard Tomlinson
last year. It would federally link
various West London medical
centres, including the Royal
Marsden and Imperial College.
Other institutions that would
form part of the centre are the
National Heart and Lung Institute,
the Institute of Cancer Research
and the Royal Postgraduate
Medical School. These institutions
may be the subject of mergers with
Imperial College {Felix 982),
forming a possible 'Imperial
College School of Medicine'.
