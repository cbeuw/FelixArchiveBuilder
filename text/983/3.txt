Farewell
Chaplain
BY JON JORDAN
The end of term sees the departure
of one of College's chaplains, Bill
Raines. Bill moves to take up a new
post in Manchester, at the elegantly
titled parish of St James and the
Holy Innocents, Birch with
Fallowfield, in the new year. Bill
has been based at Imperial College
for six years and, as such, is the
longest serving chaplain. Until
recently he was often found in
clouds of cherry tobacco and also
counted kite flying and chess
amongst his more salubrious
activities.
Despite being asked for a juicy
news bite, all the bearded cleric
could murmur was that "IC is a
great place to work, if you're a
chaplain at least". More interesting
was his view that Imperial College
students didn't really think about
science and particularly science and
religion, because they had already
accepted a certain view about it.
Felix wish him and his family well
in their new preferment.

is met by unruly students
Protests Against Patten
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Students throughout the country are
in uproar at their apparent
victimisation by John Patten
Secretary of State for Education.
Patten had to be rescued by
police on Monday when over 100
students of Balliol College, Oxford
surrounded the Parish Hall in which
he was conducting an advice
surgery. The students were refused
entry even though they had every
right to attend.
Mr Patten used the incident to
slur students and gain support for
the budget shift in student financing
from grants to loans. Speaking in
the House of Commons he stated:
"The hall was completely
surrounded by yobbish students
from Oxford University, who I am
ashamed to represent in Parliament,
and students from Oxford Brookes
University." M r Patten was in fact
himself educated at Oxford and was
also a don there, yet he seems to
fail to see the need for a well
educated population.
Student reform has not,
however, been the only reason for
recent student displeasure. Pro-
testing students at the University of
East Anglia were served with a writ
and removed from the registry
following a weekend sit in at the
loans office.
Student Loans are due to
increase next year following grants
reducing by 10%. The increase in
the maximum level of loan gives an
effective rise in student income
next year by 4%. It w i l l also
increase student debt by a
significant amount.
Keith Bradley M P , the Shadow
Social Security Minister, expressed
his concern last week: "This new
cut in the grant will undermine
students confidence in entering
higher education."
Although little has been said
regarding student grants, many
members of the House of Lords are
expressing their discontent over the
proposed student reforms. Many
think that the reforms will give the
Government too much power over
the way in which institutions are
run. With many of the Lords being
University Vice-Chancellors, many
observers are not surprised that
John Patten has faced opposition.
Speaking to the Independent, Lord
Beloff, a Conservative peer,
commented: " B y putting forward
this bill, the Government has done
something which I would have
thought was impossible. It has
united the entire university
community, from the most
reactionary Vice-Chancellor to the
most left-wing student, in
unanimous objection."
