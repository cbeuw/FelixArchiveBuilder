Ever sat watching TV and
thought, “I can do better than
that”? If not, turn over to BBC
Three.
STOIC (Student Television
Of Imperial College) is your
chance to get involved in the
exciting world of television,
albeit on a budget somewhat
smaller than that of the BBC.
Despite that, we have an
impressive studio complex
that we are reliably informed
would rival some of the small-
er satellite channels, even
though we only broadcast
to the JCR and www.stoictv.
com.
Whether your talents lie in
frontoforbehindthecameras,
there are plenty of opportuni-
ties to get involved with our
vast range of programmes.
Presenters, producers, direc-
tors, editors, camera opera-
tors, vision and sound mixers,
set designers, general techies
and more are all needed to
keep the place functioning,
which also means we count
a great variety of people
amongst our members.
In the past few years we’ve
produced news, light enter-
tainment, music and film
reviews, live events, fashion
shows and sports coverage.
We encourage new ideas and
perspectives, so feel free to
make suggestions for shows.
We mainly broadcast to the
screens in the JCR but with a
revamped service emerging
we have our content available
on our website and are look-
ing to expand our network
during the course of the year.
If you’ve read this far then
you’re probably vaguely inter-
ested in getting involved. The
first step is to attend one of
our free workshops at our
studios. You’ll get to try out
a few of the jobs listed above
to see where your talents or
interests lie. We will teach you
everything you need to know.
This year, we are running two
workshops, on Wednesday
13 October from 1pm and
on Sunday 17 October from
1.30pm.
STOIC can be found in the
West Wing of Beit Quad. Once
you’re through the archway,
turn left and swipe through
the door marked “West Wing”.
Go down the stairs, turn right
through the doors and we are
the first on the left.
To find out more about
STOIC, you can visit our
website at www.stoictv.com
(where you will currently find
a selection of programme
highlights), email us at
info@stoictv.com or drop into
our office. There is someone
in most lunchtimes. We’d be
happy to hear from you.

Coming out, going out, making
out... whatever! Welcome to
Imperial College’s LGBT
11
By Tom Lewis
and Hugo Carr
For those of you who are una-
ware, Imperial College has an
LGBT society aptly named IQ
– Imperial Queers!
Whether you’re gay, les-
bian, bisexual, transgen-
dered or questioning your
sexuality, you’re welcome to
get involved with the LGBT.
The aim of our society is to
allow LGBT students to come
together in a safe environ-
ment, where we can have a
chat, a drink, a party, a day
trip, a pub crawl – whatever
our members want really!
In previous years, IQ has
organised trips to Brighton,
Manchester and Paris. There
are university LGBT socials
practically every week, plus
the annual special events
such as World Aids Day and
the Christmas dinner. This
year, we’ve got a boat trip
planned with UCL and Kings,
a salsa workshop and a self-
defence course to name just
a few of our events. Our aim
is to show that there is more
to being gay than going to
G*A*Y.
Aside from the social
aspect of IQ, we also offer
safe space meetings. All our
members have had to come
to terms with their sexual-
ity and we’ve all got a tale
to tell. We fully understand
that, for some prospective
members, coming along for a
party straight away may not
be your cup of tea. If you have
any issues with your sexual-
ity, we really are here to lend
a helping hand. You can con-
tact IQ through the website
(http://union.ic.ac.uk/iq), and
a committee member can be
assigned to contact you via
email, then, on your terms,
meet in person.
You may have noticed that
in this year’s Union handbook
we were listed as ‘Queers’
instead of ‘Imperial Queers’.
This was caused by the policy
of the editor to omit the prefix
‘Imperial’ from the names of
all clubs and societies. In all
fairness, “it does exactly what
is says on the tin” – we are
queer. However, this error
has caused upset to some,
as ‘queers’ can be seen as
quite an aggressive, homo-
phobic word. Needless to say,
this error will not occur next
year and we apologise for the
mistake.
Right, serious bit over, now
forthefunpart!IQhaveorgan-
ised the first LGBT party at
Imperial this term. ‘Fetch’
will be held in dBs on Monday
18 October from 7–11pm, with
a trip to Heaven (London’s
premier gay nightclub) after-
wards, where everyone who
attends the party will be on
the guest list! Everyone is
welcome to come along – just
bring your dancing shoes and
an open attitude.
