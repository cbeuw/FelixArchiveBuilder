Imperial College Union
Rugby Club Tour of New
Zealand 2004
By Richard Bishop,
Jon Freedman and
Hamish Pearse-Danker
Following the success of tours
to places such as Barbados,
East Canada, South Africa
and Australia, the Imperial
College Union Rugby Football
Club (ICURFC) headed out to
New Zealand this summer.
The majority of the team
flew in to Auckland on 2 July
and headed up to Paihia for
the first match against Keri
Keri, a local club side.

After a hard introduction
to New Zealand rugby, Rob
Robinson saved the match for
Imperial with a last minute
try.
The touring party then
headed down to Hamilton to
play a Waikaito University
Varsity team.

Imperial fielded their best
side but unfortunately the
only specialist full back, Andy
Towers, dislocated his shoul-
der late in the second half,
ruling him out for the rest of
the tour. However, two late
tries and a cheeky drop goal
ensured a second win for the
touring side.
Despite staying in one of
the worst backpackers known
to man, the squad partied
hard and left the next morn-
ing for Rotarua, a town built
on huge thermal activity with
its own Polynesian Spa – very
good to relax and stretch out
sore muscles.
The third match was
against another club side,
Kahakura. Imperial trained
the day before the match and
got to watch the opposition
play before hitting the town
with them and shocking them
by the match squad not drink-
ing. Subsequently, the visitors
were confident of extending
their winning start to the tour
the next morning. How wrong
they were!

The score says it all. ICURFC
decided that hitting the bar
might be appropriate.
After shaking off some very
bad hangovers, the squad
piled back onto the bus for
a short drive to Taupo for
two days of rest and relaxa-
tion, though many decided
this wasn’t a good use of
time. Instead, they tried
their hands at jumping out
of a perfectly good aero-
plane – skydiving from 15,000
feet! From Taupo, the team
drove down to Wellington for
a match against Old Boys
University.

Imperial started the match
after a true show of com-
mitment from Dave Evans,
who ran a mile in order to
fetch boiling water to mould
former captain Tim Praill’s
gumshield. This was the best
performance of the day.
Arrival in the South Island
was a bit of a hungover blur,
with lots of time spent sleep-
ing on the floor on the boat
and then a short drive to
Nelson. Game number five
was against Nelson College.

In a match full of foul play
and conflict, Imperial didn’t
do themselves justice, losing
out in a close contest. Playing
on what was basically a bog,
the white tour kit didn’t stay
that way for long. The silky
skills of ICURFC didn’t get
chance to shine, and the team
vowed not to finish the tour
as losers.
Next, the tour bus moved
on to Kaikora. After two days
of light training and drink-
ing, Imperial were ready
for their final game, against
Canterbury University.
Unfortunately, disaster struck
as the bus wouldn’t start, so
the team arrived with only 20
minutes to warm up and train,
but everyone was pumped up
for the game.

What a great way to finish
a tour! In their final game
for Imperial, Tim Praill, Dom
Wilson, Rich Roberts and
Duncan Rutherford played
like men possessed, a fitting
tribute to their contributions
over the years.
Imperial scored early on
and had the majority of the
possession in the first half.
Canterbury came back strong
in the second half and the lead
swapped a couple of times,
only for Imperial to reclaim
it before the final whistle and
win by the narrowest of mar-
gins.
The squad left early the
next morning to head to
Queenstown for a couple of
days’ holiday. Hungover play-
ers were very scared as the
bus slid down a hill on icy
roads towards a bridge and
oncoming traffic, but legen-
dary driver Bruce saved the
team.
ThelastnightinQueenstown
saw the Kangaroo Court,
where tour ‘indiscretions’ are
punished. There was some
quality fancy dress including
a fluorescent orange dress, a
baby’s outfit and a suit made
out of bin liners. A lot of lager
later, the players stumbled
into town for their final night
out amid some very cold
weather.
The tour would not have
been such a huge success
without the contributions of
tour manager Neil Davies and
sponsors Singapore Airlines
and Geoservices.
