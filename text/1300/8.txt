Your immediate inclination
may be to skip the Careers
section, especially if you’re
a fresher or in the middle of
your studies – after all, there’s
plenty of time to worry about
your post-university career,
right? Wrong.
Now, employers want the lot
– a good degree just doesn’t
cut it. They want to know you
have a multitude of relevant
skills, with evidence to prove
it. When, in your final year,
the panic of being cast out
into the real world begins
to set in, the Freshers Fair
suddenly becomes a must.
Joining Dance or Debating
at this late stage may help
to show you’re a more ‘well-
rounded’ person but it prob-
ably won’t be enough to get
you the job you have been
dreaming about (that is, if
you’re lucky enough to know
what you want to do).
Developing a repertoire
of skills and a glowing CV
are your keys to a successful
future and it’s important to
bear this in mind from the out-
set. Even if you have no idea
what career path you want to
take, that’s even more reason
for getting involved and dis-
covering what’s out there.
We’re the first to admit to
whiling away our undergrad-
uate years in various London
watering holes, blissfully una-
ware of the harsh realities
and competitiveness of the
world awaiting us. Therefore,
perhaps it isn’t surprising to
hear that we are still students
– PhD students, with another
three years of shelter under
the umbrella that is univer-
sity (actually, a PhD can be a
very difficult undertaking that
may postpone ‘decision time’
but brings numerous other
stresses. However, that’s
another story).
Worryingly, psychologists
have identified a new phe-
nomenon occurring in the
mid-twenties, termed the
‘quarterlife crisis’. It’s a
general depression that hits
graduates who are suddenly
faced with the difficulties of
building a life for themselves
in a world where good jobs
are hard to come by and adult
life seems rather stressful
and mundane with all its tedi-
ous responsibilities.
The Felix Careers section
therefore aims to help and
encourage students to make
a successful transition from
their degree studies, be they
undergraduate or postgradu-
ate, to their career paths. By
providing advice and informa-
tion, we hope to allow you to
identify some of the neces-
sary skills you will need, ways
to develop them, and see the
relevance of these skills in dif-
ferent working environments.
How to promote yourself and
your abilities and manage
your university time effec-
tively will also be discussed,
along with links to the best
resources and information
about work experience and
upcoming events.
Perhaps at the start of your
degree you had an idea about
what you hoped to achieve.
During your studies it’s use-
ful to revisit those objectives,
to assess the progress you’re
making and also add to them.
Even if you are still not clear
about what you want to do
after you finish, it’s never
too late to set goals for your
professional and personal
development. To ensure you
are able to tackle the transi-
tion and find a promising job,
make the most of your uni-
versity life, the resources and
the people. Imperial has an
excellent careers department
where you can arrange one-
to-one talks with experienced
advisors, and provides a vast
choice of clubs, societies and
student activities.

this section, any thoughts or

CASSANDRA ALDRICH
CAREERS EDITORS
By Cassandra Aldrich
Over dinner with a good
friend of mine who works as
a trader at Citigroup (and
also happens to be involved
in selecting applicants – a pity
then that I’m not interested in
banking), I took the opportu-
nity to find out precisely what
the company looks for when
recruiting.
The selection process for
both internship and perma-
nent positions in the Trading
and Sales Department usu-
ally consists of a number of
stages. Firstly, a ‘filtering
out’ process is conducted
by Human Resources (HR)
based on applicants’ CVs. If
your CV is picked out, you
will be invited to a first inter-
view with employees working
in the department. If they like
you, you’ll be asked to spend a
few days on the trading floor,
taking part in simulated and
problem solving exercises
alongside other applicants.
Get through all this and
there’s a final interview with
more senior members of the
department.
HR look for a number of
key things in a CV. Firstly a
good academic record is very
important – without good
grades it tends to be more
difficult. True to their litera-
ture, Citigroup will potentially
recruit from any degree dis-
cipline: “I don’t look for an
economics degree. What’s
important is that they’ve
done their research and can
have a conversation with
me about the markets”. The
other main things HR look
for in a CV are previous work
experience in finance, which
is evidence of a real desire
to work in the industry, and
linguistic abilities: “You’ll go
to the top of the pile if you’re
fluent in other languages”. It
is, however, still possible to
be recruited without a second
language.
If your CV is selected,
you’ll then be interviewed.
“At interview I’m thinking of
two things – firstly, do they
understand the workings of
the market, and secondly,
can we work with, and get
on with, this person?” The
general gist was that you
must know your stuff and be
friendly and confident. Don’t
be afraid to sell yourself and
don’t appear ‘flaky’. If you are
then asked to take part in the
exercises ‘on the floor’, you
need to demonstrate an abil-
ity to handle stress well and
work efficiently with other
people: “You won’t be suc-
cessful on the trading floor
unless you’re tough”.
If you still think you’re
suited, then the pluses are
numerous – great salary,
potential mega bonuses,
expense accounts, trips
abroad (not just work but also
client entertainment), and
evenings and weekends free,
since obviously the markets
close.
Inside story: recruitment at Citigroup
By Gabriella Silvestri
and Cassandra Aldrich
It makes sense to plan ahead,
whether you want to take
time out, go on to further
study, find employment or
even if you have no idea what
you’re going to do. You will
find achieving your goals sat-
isfying and more enjoyable
and ultimately be more suc-
cessful. Whichever route you
choose to follow, you will need
relevant information to help
you on your way.
Did you know that 87% of
students agree that univer-
sity is a good investment,
and people with a higher
education qualification are
likely to earn on average 50%
more than those without?
However, although the gradu-
ate job market has grown and
become more diverse, recent
studies have suggested that
graduates struggle to find
their ideal roles in today’s
recruitment market, which is
now less predictable.
According to research car-
ried out by the Association of
Graduate Recruiters (AGR),
which predominantly repre-
sents large blue chip firms
and public sector employers,
there is intense competition
in the employer’s market.
Employers received an aver-
age of 42.1 applications for
every graduate vacancy dur-
ing the past year, up from 37.2
in 2001-02.
The mistake often made is
to think that a degree from
Imperial is sufficient to get
any job. Although your degree
is a mark of your intellec-
tual ability and your potential,
many employers will place
less importance on your sub-
ject of study than the per-
sonal skills and qualities you
possess. Continuous personal
learning is becoming increas-
ingly important as employers
search for the very best can-
didates.
The five essential skills for
employment (as given in the
Imperial Careers Advisory
Service Guide) are:
● teamwork ability
● communication
● interpersonal skills
● problem solving
● planning and organising.
Joining a sports team is
often looked upon favourably
as evidence of teamwork abil-
ities, while joining a student
society may demonstrate
interpersonal skills.
Voluntary work, a well-
planned gap year and work
placements will help to
strengthen your CV and
complement your academic
abilities. If you are planning
to take time out from your
studies you should organise
some useful work experience
or alternatively work first
to fund subsequent travels.
Simply jet-setting around
the world is less impressive.
Arranging work abroad, how-
ever, will look great.
Planning your next move
THE ‘MUST’ POINTS
● Evaluate your abilities
● Build a portfolio of skills
● Set personal objectives
● Go to your Careers Service
● Think about a career plan
Climbing the steps: planning your next move can help your career reach new heights
