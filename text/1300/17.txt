The poor Tate Britain. Ever since
the opening of the Tate Modern, it
has been somewhat overshadowed.
The Tate Modern opened in such a
blaze of publicity, of all descriptions,
and was blessed with the added
attraction of the first new bridge
in London since the nineteenth
century. When we say “Tate” these
days, the mind immediately goes all
the way across town to Southwark.
However, the eyes, and opinions, of
the nation do manage to focus on
the original Tate, the Tate Britain,
once a year: you can’t avoid the
Turner Prize.
It’s not Turner time yet, though
the exhibition does open later this
month. However, the Tate Britain
has just launched the first major
exhibition of the work of sibling art-
ists Gwen and Augustus John, cov-
ering the period up to the death of
Gwen in 1939. It is a surprisingly
engaging exhibition of the very dif-
ferent works, and a collection that
the curators are at pains to point
out was not envisaged as a ‘compare
and contrast’ exercise.
The Johns were both born in Wales
in the late 1870s and later stud-
ied at the Slade School in London
during the 1890s. Augustus found
fame early on. For Gwen, fame came
more slowly but has been much
more enduring. Both lived some-
what unconventionally by the stand-
ards of the time; Augustus’ lifestyle
would still not be considered as nor-
mal. A man of apparently magnetic
personality, he lived for a time with
both his wife and his mistress, and
all their children, in a gypsy cara-
van. Gwen, despite the rather sub-
dued and somewhat dour image that
comes from her paintings, was a
stupendously independent woman.
She settled, living alone in Paris,
and modelled for some of the art-
ists of the day, most famously Rodin
with whom she ended up having a
flaming affair – not really what one
would expect from the woman in the
pictures! Despite this, Gwen John
remained a very private individual
and after the death of Rodin, the
focus of her life became religion. By
contrast, Augustus John remained a
singularly exuberant and extrovert-
ed personality with voracious sexual
appetites to the end of his life. The
significant differences in their per-
sonalities translate themselves into
equally different artistic styles.
The exhibition has been ordered
chronologically so as to show best
the development of the artists’
styles, beginning with drawings and
paintings they produced of each
other and their friends while still
at the Slade, and concluding with
works completed just before 1940. It
is immediately obvious, even from
the pictures from the early period,
that Gwen and Augustus had very
different outlooks on life. Augustus,
throughout his career, used bold
colour and painted his subjects in
such a manner that their person-
alities, usually equally expansive as
the painter’s own, are captured. At
least, it was their personalities as
Augustus saw them. One subject,
W B Yeats, was somewhat less than
pleased with his portrait, saying that
he looked ‘a sheer tinker, drunk-
en, unpleasant and disreputable’.
On the other hand, Gwen chose to
focus more on painting itself. She
was constantly experimenting with
light and was deeply troubled by
the question: ‘When is a painting
complete?’, treating her subjects,
mostly women, as just another part
of a still life composition. In Gwen’s
later works, this preoccupation with
‘the painting’ becomes most clear,
though the quick sketches she pro-
duced while travelling or just sitting
in church do focus more on the ‘life’
they are capturing.
The early difference in style is
particularly evident in the Johns’
portrayals of one Dorelia McNeill,
a muse to both and the mistress of
Augustus. Gwen depicts a quiet girl
with fine features; Augustus built
her up into his dream of the wild,
free gypsy woman. In my opinion,
what he mostly achieves is to make
Dorelia (a name he created for her)
look like a cheap hussy.
I found Gwen John’s work to be
somewhat more interesting and
engaging, despite Augustus’ good
use of colour (vibrant colour usually
being a sure winner in my book), and
despite the rather mundane subject
matter of Gwen’s paintings. You have
to admire the woman behind them
and her patience to create such still,
yet captivating, images. Her style
is quite unique – layers of careful
brush strokes, a very muted use of
colour, the three quarter length fig-
ures – while her chosen subjects are
unremarkable, everyday scenes.
For those of you with an interest
in art, I would not hesitate to recom-
mend this exhibition, primarily as
an exercise in viewing the develop-
ing styles of two siblings. The appall-
ing inability of Augustus to achieve
a satisfying composition for murals
would also be a sobering experience
for any amateur artists among you.
However, I would direct those
just starting out in ‘art apprecia-
tion’ to the National Gallery and the
Renaissance rooms instead – there
is good use of colour, composition
and some more engaging subject
matter. Also, the ‘peep box’ in one of
the rooms containing Dutch paint-
ings from the era of Vermeer is quite
entertaining.

Visions by Alex Holland
For those of you who are in search
of the arts but have a singular aver-
sion to travel, the Blyth Gallery
on the fifth floor of our very own
Sherfield Building is a treat. The
building itself is another matter
altogether.
Take the lift up to the fifth floor
(or if you’re feeling the need, go
up the more strenuous way, feel
free), and you will be greeted by
an array of photographs by Alex
Holland and Ian Gillett. Holland
has titled his side of the exhibition
Light, Direction, Reflection, while
Gillett has left such things up to the
imagination of the viewer.
The subjects and feel of the works
by the two photographers are as dif-
ferent as their approaches to exhi-
bition titling. One is colourful and
lively, while the other is somewhat
more contemplative and reflective.
The photographs submitted by
Gillett are primarily what I would
call fashion photos. There are
images of well known models glid-
ing down the catwalk in the latest
designs, as well as some of lesser
known models and designers. The
vibrant atmosphere of the fashion
show is well captured, and through-
out his models look like they are
actually enjoying themselves.
The twelve photographs that
make up Holland’s exhibition have
been selected to illustrate the three
themes in his title – three themes he
believes are central to the decision-
making process in photography.
The photographs are a selection
of landscapes and cityscapes. Quite
amazingly, Holland has managed
the impossible and actually made
an assortment of locations around
Imperial College look interesting.
Overall, one walks away from look-
ing at his images in a much more
serene mood, but also in a state
of desperation regarding one’s own
inability to see London with the
same vision.
The exhibition runs throughout
October and is completely free, so
make the effort and go.

New entrance
at the National
Arts stories appear to be making it
into the main sections of the news-
papers with a vastly increasing fre-
quency these days. What is most
amazing about this current trend
is that it has absolutely nothing to
do with any idiocy that has been
spouted by the Arts Minister.
Unfortunately, all of this coverage
hasn’t exactly been positive of late.
An exception to the general gloom
of stolen money and quitting direc-
tors (the Design Museum’s director
has recently resigned) is the new
entrance to the National Gallery and
the associated ‘new’ space.
The Getty entrance is a somewhat
less tourist-infested way to get into
the gallery; to the east of the main
entrance it’s also easy to find. There
is a new café, a vast improvement
on the existing one, serving a good
variety of dishes. However, it is a
little on the pricey side of things.
A new shop has also been added,
along with a new range of quite clev-
erly themed merchandise.
In the midst of all the renova-
tions, they have unfortunately been
unable to make the school groups
disappear.
