CLUB REVIEW
The Fridge is a venue famed for its
nights of dance music on the hard-
er side, and found (as most places
offering this kind of music are) away
from central London, and south of
the river.
The kind of music you can expect
to hear is hard house/trance and
the like. Music like this has taken
off enormously over the past few
years, with more and more huge
(and messy) events like Hard House
Academy – at Brixton’s 4000-capac-
ity Carling Academy – appearing.
While the harder forms of music
have increased in popularity stead-
ily recently, others have declined.
Without going too deeply into genre
politics, I think it’s fair to say that
trance is one of those on the way
down, not just in the quality of the
music being produced, but also
those playing it, and its reception by
the public and the media (Fabric’s
music policy specifically states ‘no
trance’).
I found the smaller house room
at Knowwhere quite pleasant – up
front, up to date music, and the floor
was reasonably full, if not packed
out. Sadly I didn’t enjoy the main
room half as much. Playing mostly
trance, the DJs didn’t seem to have
half the talent of those in the other
room.
The difficulty with trance music
is that it’s dense and layered, and
to mix it well requires an ear for
music as well as just a beat. Many
times tonight, I was left wondering
how the DJs were getting away with
it, as the mixing tended to slow me
down more than gee me up.
Appearing tonight for a special
live PA was hard trance producer
K90. No stranger to The Fridge, and
reknowned in hard dance circles,
his squealing synth riffs took over
the place, and for the first time that
evening grabbed me. Now I was
loving it – the crowd, the lights, the
twisted, penetrating sounds.
All in all I had a pretty good night,
though £16 is pretty pricey. You can
pay less and get a lot more out of a
club on a Friday (that said, they were
selling laughing gas in balloons). It’s
a shame that the Fridge has gone
against their usual winning formula
with a night like this.

CLUB REVIEW
Buttoned Down Disco is a new con-
cept in indie clubs – invitation only.
The plan is to keep the general popu-
lation out, and the music lovers in.
Once a month, you’re emailed the
location and you have to show up
with a copy of the email in your hot
little hands.
Infinity, the venue for this month’s
BDD, is a tiny two floor place.
Roughly 250 people are crammed
into what is a low-ceilinged sweatbox
of a club. The first thing you notice on
entering the place is how friendly the
people are. They make space for you
at the seriously crowded bar, chat
while they’re waiting for the toilets,
and offer you a cigarette if they’re
about to smoke one. It’s so refresh-
ing to be in an indie club where
there are no drunken idiots leching
at girls, and no fighting at all.
The tracklisting is a little eclectic
for most – I’d be surprised if I heard
the stuff the mainstream indie clubs
are playing: the Strokes, Razorlight
etc. It’s been overdone by the thou-
sands of clubs that have sprung up
around Tottenham Court Road over
the last couple of years. Instead,
you get tracks that veer wildly from
eighties electro classics to nine-
ties dance to noughties punk, and
everywhere in between. Examples
include Gary Numan’s Cars, The
Velvet Underground’s I’m Waiting
For My Man and Beyonce’s Crazy
In Love.
Upstairs is the main dance floor,
where there’s not an inch of space
that’s not covered by bodies. We were
just standing by the bar, when the DJ
mixed the Chemical Brothers’ Hey
Boy, Hey Girl into whatever electro
track had preceded it, and the place
went wild. The meaty, bass-heavy
soundsystem is pointed right at the
dancefloor and is one of the best I’ve
heard.
Downstairs, the atmosphere is
much more chilled. I spent an hour
down there, and heard mostly down-
beat reggae, soul and the occasional
bit of house. The volume is lower, so
it’s easy to talk and wander around
random people.
Because the atmosphere is so
much friendlier, the door staff are
less rough and more accommodat-
ing. The heat is fairly intense, and
there was no problem with me nip-
ping out to get a bit of fresh air for
ten minutes – I walked around the
block and came back, and they let
me straight back in without any has-
sle.
I’d only been once before tonight,
and that was about six months ago.
That was easily one of the best
nights I’ve ever had, and this time
it was almost as good. As far as
indie clubs go, this one is a league
apart. The invitation-only idea keeps
the same people coming back, the
music is diverse and eclectic, and
the atmosphere is incredibly friend-
ly. I almost don’t want to spread the
word, because it’s so great already,
but you really need to try this place
if you’re tired of the Mean Fiddler,
the Metro, and all the other copycat
venues running the same kind of
indie nights.

Hello and welcome to the second
of this year’s Nightlife sections. My
aim over the coming year is to equip
you with as much knowledge of the
London club scene as possible, and
hopefully encourage you to go out
and experience some of it yourself.
I’m sure you don’t need to be told,
but London is the best place in the
world for a lot of things, and clubbing
is certainly one of them. When I talk
about clubbing, I have to confess I
have a slightly blinkered view. To
me, a club is a place where people
go to dance. There are a lot of places
with dancefloors, big soundsystems
and lightshows, and even halfway
competent DJs, but if everyone is
there just to get pissed on £1-a-shot
vodka, I really don’t see the point.
For me, clubs exist first and fore-
most to play pumping music that will
make you want to dance all night,
and all night in this case means until
the next morning (usually around
the time the tube opens at week-
ends). The existence of these places
is a real breath of fresh air, especially
when all you’re used to is ‘clubs’ full
of underage kids getting as drunk
as they can as cheaply as possible,
and men trying to pull drunk girls.
I’m not saying I don’t like cheap
beer – god forbid, but what I am
saying is that there are different
nights out to be had depending on
what you expect. Go clubbing and
you might just be refreshed at the
amount of intelligent conversation
to be had, and the lack of hassle
from members of the opposite sex.
Either way, choose an event that
suits your taste, and you will not be
disappointed by the music.
Also refreshing is the general lack
of dress codes at clubs across the
city. Some places insist on silly rules
like forcing you to wear shoes (not
great for dancing in) or not allow-
ing jeans, but in London you’ll very
rarely find this a problem.
In terms of the different styles of
music on offer, you can more or less
take your pick. The secret is knowing
where to look. The club scene really
covers everything, with indie clubs as
well as the usual offerings of hip-hop,
R&B and soul, right through house
(in all its forms), garage, breakbeat,
trance, drum and bass, jungle, and
right up to happy hardcore for the
nutters amongst you, plus anything
I forgot in between.
There are hundreds of establish-
ments all over London willing to take
your hard-borrowed cash, and some
are nowhere near the standard of
others. Prices start from nothing
and go up to £20 at some of the more
classy venues like Pacha, or even
higher for special big events. Don’t
go to places just because of the price
tag though, as there are many hid-
den gems around that you won’t
even have to pay for (see our review
of Buttoned Down Disco, above). It
can be advisable to acquire tickets
for a given night in advance. Most of
the big clubs now offer some form of
credit card booking system, and it’s
a lot nicer to pick up your tickets and
walk straight through the doors than
queue for hours and still not get in.
London attracts a lot of big name
DJs, and whilst the really huge
names (Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold)
spend most of their time out of this
country, they all stop back regularly
to pack out the clubs. A lot of the DJs
here are mostly known for the nights
they play at, with real cult followings.
There is also a lot of up and coming
talent to be seen if you keep your
eyes and ears open.
The best way to find out what’s
on is to start going out. When you
leave a club, you’ll be accosted by
people handing out flyers, usually
in big bundles, for upcoming events
in town, with the type of club you’re
leaving directly related to the flyers
you receive. As well as that, you can
keep up to date with the features,
reviews and listings found in Felix.
The web is also a fantastic source of
information – all the big clubs have
their own sites.
The key to finding clubs you like
is experimentation. You have to give
things a try, and with the world’s
best night out possibly ahead of you,
who can resist?
One of my favourite things about
clubbing is the afterparties. Dancing
through until six, seven or eight
in the morning might seem mad
enough, but consider that there are
also special events laid on to start
as these nights are finishing. While I
doubt that very many people get up
extra early on a Saturday to go and
get in amongst the sweaty ravers, if
you’re already out then your sleep
patterns are already screwed, so
why the hell not? Afterparties gener-
ally cost less than the nights preced-
ing them, and can carry on well into
the next evening. The crowds are
often more fun, and tend to be in a
bit of a state since they haven’t been
home yet. Once you start going to
events like these, you’ll realise there
is a real sub-culture associated with
clubbing.
The people you find are another
joy of the club scene. While at cer-
tain places you may visit there will
be many overtly drunk people, often
with drunken senses of humour and
taste, you’ll find most people you
meet in clubs to be friendly and kind.
People share water, gum, cigarettes
and lots and lots of big grins. If you
bump into someone, or they bump
into you, they’ll turn and apologise.
It’s very easy to start conversations,
and once you’ve started it can be all
too easy to tell absolute strangers
your whole life story.
Clubbing gives you an opportu-
nity to make friends like no other.
My closest friends have generally
been my clubbing friends, and this
is partly because you spend so much
time together. Six to eight hours
inside a club, plus a couple before
and after, is probably more than you
spend with your mates on a normal
night out. You also develop great
trust – when you’re looking after one
another on mad little missions round
the city, it comes pretty quickly.
So there you go – all the reasons
anyone could ever need to go club-
bing, or at least to give it a try.
Ifyou’vemadeitthisfarandarestill
interested, or if I’ve been preaching
to the converted, then you’re in luck.
Our Nightlife section doesn’t write
itself, and you may have noticed that
all of last week’s edition, and most
of this week’s, were written by little
old me. If you think you could write
a review of a club, or have any com-
ments or experiences (good or bad)
to do with London clubbing then we
want to hear from you!
Felix needs reviewers to keep its
various sections up to date, and this
could be you. You don’t need any
experience at all, and the best part
is you get to go free! Promoters like
to give us free CDs, gig tickets and
guestlist places, so that we can then
review them.
I love this – I get to go to all my
favourite late night hangouts, it’s
free, I get to skip the queue and look
all cool saying “my name’s on the
list”, and all I have to do is write a lit-
tle bit about the night I had in return.
Simple, right?
If you’d like to write for us and go
clubbing for free (and this can save
you a lot when you consider you get
your entry plus a friend’s for) then
email me at clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk, or
drop into the Felix office any time.
