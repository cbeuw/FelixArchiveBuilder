The Imperial College Union
Cross Country and Athletics
Club descended on the run-
ning hotspot of Lanzarote for
its annual summer training
week.
The island was selected
for its tropical climate and
arduous terrain produced
by volcanic eruptions dur-
ing the eighteenth century.
Conveniently, the eruptions
died down several hundred
years ago, to be replaced by
a large variety of bars and
nightclubs across the island.
These proved essential in
ensuring that rapid rehydra-
tion was possible after all
training sessions.
The tone of the week was
set when team members set
out for the first run at 2.30am,
only 15 minutes after arriv-
ing at the training base. The
focused attitude to training
continued throughout the
week, with the first run of
each day starting at 7.30am,
just late enough to allow eve-
ryone to return from the pre-
vious night’s activities. This
was followed up by an evening
high intensity hills session. To
keep a balance, cross train-
ing methods were employed,
with members engaging in
swimming, cycling and circuit
training over the course of the
week. The distance record
for the week was set by club
stalwart Dave Mulvee, who
completed a century of junk
miles.
The trip was originally set
for four team members, but
was then invaded upon by out-
siders. One of the team was
ageing student Gavin, reput-
ed to be the oldest standing
member of Imperial College
Union. Gavin had also paid
for his estranged son Wicksy
to come along, in a shallow
attempt to make up for the
lack of maintenance pay-
ments over the years. Gavin
justified this by pointing out
that as long as he stayed at
Imperial he would never have
to pay his student loan back
to the government, and that
there was therefore no rea-
son why the same shouldn’t
apply to Wicksy and his moth-
er. Gavin’s silent motive for
bringing Wicksy along was to
teach him the ways of the
world before he became too
old to perform.
The second outsider was
club captain turned tube driv-
er Mike “Gobshite” Boucher,
fresh from the last strike and
ready for action. In fact, he
was so keen to stand with
his brothers on the picket
line that he missed the flight
and had to catch us up later.
FlightstoLanzarotewereonly
available on Thursdays, so he
was forced to fly to Grand
Canaria, aiming to swim the
rest of the way. When this
plan failed, he was forced to
strike a deal with some local
sailors, the details of which
he was unwilling to disclose.
All that could be gathered is
that the deal incorporated the
infamous ‘sodom stick’.
As soon as Mike arrived, he
waskeentomakehismarkand
insisted that the group visited
Lady Muck’s stand-up show.
The team were shocked to
discover that the lady in ques-
tion was in fact a man whom
Mike had previously worked
with. Upon arrival, we were
escorted to the front row so
that we could get the most out
of the show. Lady Muck took a
particular shine to Gavin and
asked for his assistance many
times throughout the night.
We were all surprised at how
untroubled Gavin was by the
high level of male bonding
involved, but the mystery was
cleared up once he reminded
us how long he had been an
Imperial PhD student.
As always, the team was
keen to forge links with other

Ever been trucking? Enjoy
pub crawls? Want to learn to
drive a lorry? Well if you do
(or even if you don’t) then the
Royal School of Mines Motor
Club could be for you.
The club is responsible for
the maintenance and running
of a 1926 one tonne Morris
truck called Clementine, or
Clem for short. Clem has been
at the college since the 1960s
and she has the advantage of
being fitted out with bench
seats in the back, making her
ideal for going on pub crawls
or trips around London.
If you want to learn some
basic mechanical skills, drink
cups of tea, but also enjoy
yourself socially then make
sure you join the RSM Motor
Club. Turn up at 1pm any
Wednesday at the garage in
Prince’s Gate Mews (behind
Southside).

groups. It was decided that
the most mutual benefit could
be attained by approaching
the young ladies holidaying
on the island. The level of
success was mixed, although
certain team members hit
particular stumbling blocks.
The first to fall was toff team
captain Jon, finding that the
socio-economic mix of ladies
on the island were somewhat
unresponsive to his “alleged-
ly” extreme right wing views.
Jeff didn’t experience this
problem as he decided to dive
straight in with a more physi-
cal approach. Several young
ladies complained that these
approaches were too intru-
sive, leading to Jeff’s removal
from a number of clubs. We
think the ladies in question
should have been grateful
that he was not carrying the
sodom stick. As a last straw,
he approached a middle-aged
lady who was walking home
with her two teenage chil-
dren. Despite multiple flat-
tering comments, she still
chose to return to her hus-
band. Following a common
trend, Jeff was forced to sleep
alone.
The trip put considerable
financial strain on several
members, especially consid-
ering the number and extent
of rehydration sessions need-
ed throughout the week. This
was exacerbated when the
police had to be compensat-
ed for releasing Jon and Jeff
from their custody. Although
the exact circumstances are
unclear, it is thought that they
were involved in a fracas with
a local kebab owner over the
amountofbreadthatshouldbe
included with a kebab. A local
witness suggested that their
attempt to perform a ‘good
cop bad cop’ routine on the
kebab shop owner had gone
horribly wrong. Desperate to
raise funds, Mike and Dave
headed to the local casino.
After only an hour they had
lost a three figure sum, but
Mike shrugged it off claiming
that he could easily get the
money back with half a dozen
loops of the Circle Line.
In summary, the training
should provide an excellent
base for the coming cross
country season. However, the
unbalanced environment pro-
vided within Imperial College
and the London Underground
network left club members
completely unprepared for
the challenges provided
by the women. Perhaps we
should all have followed in
Gavin’s footsteps and found
our own Lady Muck.
