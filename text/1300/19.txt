Hello again! Hope you enjoyed the
last puzzle. This week’s has a couple
of playful aspects, as promised, but
they’re not well hidden.
I should warn you that 4 down is
an old poetic word, not currently
in use. It can sometimes be impos-
sible to avoid obscure words with-
out scrapping half the grid, and I’m
afraid in this case I’ve chickened
out. For fairness, I should add that
the answer looks fairly normal, and
that a related form can be found in
Spenser’s poem Virgil’s Gnat.
If you’re new to cryptic cross-
words, fear not – in future columns
I’ll explain some of the basic types
of clue. For now, start with 18 across
and 8 down. Snufkin
