In less than a month, America
goes to the polls to choose
between John Kerry and
George W Bush. So far, most
of what we have heard from
the candidates seems to
revolve around the situation
in Iraq and the ‘war on ter-
ror’. Domestic issues seem
less important than the can-
didates’ Vietnam war records.
We have not, however, heard
much from the candidates in
the run-up to these elections
on the really divisive issues.
Science policy is one of these.
In February this year, 60
of America’s leading scien-
tists, including Nobel laure-
ates, medical experts, former
federal agency directors and
university chairs, voiced
their concern at the mis-
use of science by the Bush
administration. In the months
since this report, presented
by the Union of Concerned
Scientists (UCS), 5000 scien-
tists have signed in support
of the document, which was
entitled Restoring Scientific
Integrity in Policy Making.
The scientists accuse the
Bush administration of fid-
dling findings to suit their
political agenda. According to
the UCS, the administration
had misrepresented the find-
ings of the National Academy
of Sciences and other experts
on climate change to suit
themselves.
Furthermore, in April’s
issue of Scientific American,
the editorial compared the
Bush administration’s atti-
tude towards science with
that of 1930s Stalinist Russia –
where Lysenkoism promoted
unsuccessful and damaging
scientific theories that fell in
line with ideology, rather than
successful theories that were
supported by experiment.
This sort of antiscientifc
attitude is not surprising con-
sidering that George W Bush
was once famously quoted as
saying “the jury’s still out” on
whether man had descended
from the apes. Bush is not a
man who is affected by over-
whelming and incontraven-
able scientific evidence.
The real scientific battle-
grounds this year are on the
issues of climate change and
stem cell research, where
the candidates take opposing
stances. On climate change,
the Bush administration has
been heavily criticised for dis-
missing cuts in greenhouse
gas emissions recommended
by the Kyoto Protocol. They
claim to favour the develop-
ment of cleaner fuel-burn-
ing technologies and volun-
tary industry-led reductions.
Kerry has also dismissed the
Kyoto Protocol in its current
format, but is keen to resume
international climate change
negotiations. Unsurprisingly,
Kerry is widely held to be the
greener candidate.
Bush’s position on climate
change can be attributed
to his party’s extensive ties
with the oil industry, who
bankrolled his 2000 election
success. For example, Dick
Cheney, the vice-president,
was the former chief execu-
tive of oil giants Halliburton,
a company who have swept
up billions of dollars worth of
Iraqi oil contracts.
When it came to human
embryonic stem cell research,
Bush based his decision to
go against the advice of sci-
entists on his concerns for
“violating ethical principles”
and his insistence on “main-
taining respect for all human
life”. His all-out ban on the
federal funding of research
on stem cell lines created
after August 2001 (which does
still allow limited research on
older samples) would, how-
ever, be lifted by an incoming
Kerry administration. Kerry
cites that “more than 100 mil-
lion Americans suffer from
illnesses that one day could
be wiped away with stem cell
therapy, including cancer,
Parkinson’s, diabetes, and
other debilitating diseases”.
When compared his stance
on climate change, Bush’s
position on stem cell research
is of a different, more funda-
mental, even religious nature.
It is an issue to which Bush
claims to have given a great
deal of “thought, prayer and
considerable reflection”. He
is even said to have consulted
the Vatican before making the
decision to ban any further
production of stem cell lines
for research. But this is of
absolutely no consolation to
the scientific community or
those who could be cured as a
result of such research.
As the gap between the
candidates narrows after the
Presidential debates, these
could be the issues that
could decide who will win.
My answer to the headline?
Kerry, of course.

Amerika is wunderbar: Kerry (left) and Bush are divided on controversial science
“The scientists

This year’s Ig Nobel award
ceremony celebrated some
of the world’s most unique
and imaginative pieces of
research.
The prizes were awarded
at Harvard University’s
Sanders Theatre to individu-
als who had really pushed the
boundariesofcomprehension.
The genuine, but somewhat
amusing, studies included an
experiment involving a man
in a gorilla suit, Coca Cola’s
remarketing of tap water
(Dasani), the man who pat-
ented the combover, and fish
who communicate by break-
ing wind.
And the winners of these
prestigious awards were...
Medicine
Steven Stack of Wayne State
University, Detroit, USA.
Reference: “The Effect of
Country Music on Suicide.”
Social Forces, vol 71, no 1,
September 1992, pp 211-8.
Physics
Ramesh Balasubramaniam
of the University of Ottawa,
and Michael Turvey of the
University of Connecticut, for
exploring and explaining the
dynamics of hula-hooping.
Reference: “Coordination
Modes in the Multisegmental
Dynamics of Hula Hooping.”
Biological Cybernetics, vol
90, no 3, March 2004, pp 176-
90
Public health
Jillian Clarke of the Chicago
High School for Agricultural
Sciences, and then Howard
University, for investigat-
ing the scientific validity of
the Five Second Rule about
whether it’s safe to eat food
that’s been dropped on the
floor.
Chemistry
The Coca-Cola Company
of Great Britain, for using
advanced technology to con-
vert liquid from the River
Thames into Dasani, a trans-
parent form of water, which
for precautionary reasons
has been made unavailable to
consumers.
Engineering
Donald J Smith and his father,
the late Frank J Smith, of
Orlando, Florida, USA, for
patenting the combover (US
Patent number 4,022,227).
Psychology
Daniel Simons of the
University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and
Christopher Chabris of
Harvard University, for dem-
onstrating that when people
pay close attention to some-
thing, it’s all too easy to over-
look anything else – even a
man in a gorilla suit.
Reference: “Gorillas in Our
Midst”, vol 28, Perception,
1999, pp 1059-74.

visit).
Economics
The Vatican, for outsourcing
prayers to India.
Peace
Daisuke Inoue of Hyogo,
Japan, for inventing karaoke,
thereby providing an entirely
new way for people to learn to
tolerate each other.
Biology
BenWilsonoftheUniversityof
British Columbia, Lawrence
Dill of Simon Fraser
University, Robert Batty of
the Scottish Association for
Marine Science, Magnus
Whalberg of the University
of Aarhus [Denmark],
and Hakan Westerberg of
Sweden’s National Board of
Fisheries, for showing that
herrings apparently commu-
nicate by farting.

duced by herring (Clupea
harengus) bubble release”
