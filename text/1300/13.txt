The worst
Reading ever?
A suspiciously similar line-up to last
year, excessive amounts of rain not
seen since Glastonbury, and
several serious bottlings
LIVE REVIEW
Thirteen hours of solid rain, two
boys relieving themselves on my
tent and a maniac playing his drum
kit in the camp site until four in the
morning. And that was before a sin-
gle band had hit the stage. Cue: ‘The
Worst Reading Festival Ever.’
Friday
I can think of no better band to coax
me out of my mud-induced strop
than Jurassic 5. Refreshingly un-
gangster, this bouncy, melodic, old
school hip hop act amused the soggy
crowd with hand clapping games
and solos on toys from the Early
Learning Centre. The mental age
of the crowd was well anticipated
then. In contrast, Hole wannabes
The Distillers (like the dull, arduous
task of the same name) sounded so
unvaried that their set may as well
have comprised of one thirty minute
track. It’s a shame Brody Dahl’s
complicated soap-style love life is
the most interesting thing the band
have going for them.
Slightly more engaging were The
Hives. In three words: same as ever,
but since they consistently provide
an energetic onslaught of tunes and
good humour, I couldn’t complain.
Thank you, or should I say you’re
welcome? Which is more than I will
say to Ash’s shameless omission of
flagship tracks Goldfinger and Oh
Yeah, making for a set devoid of any
truly inspiring moments. However,
throwing in a flaming guitar and
Har Mar Superstar shaking his size-
able bootie certainly livened things
up – as Tim Wheeler so aptly put it,
“dance motherf**ker, dance!”
As ever, The Offspring proved
themselves incapable of disappoint-
ing. Their set was clearly tailored to
more hardy fans, including a good
smattering from Smash, a fairly
uncommercial selection from later
albums and the thankful exclusion
of The Worst Hangover Ever, a steel
drum extravaganza that may well
have been penned by a fifteen-year-
old fan. Front man Dexter Holland
was charismatic as ever, providing
the front row with popcorn in case
they were hungry, and splashing out
on the more confetti than you can
shake a stick at.
In the style of a ‘Time Life, can’t
buy this in the shops, best rock
dross in the world ever volume 10’
effort, The Darkness were awful.
Like a showcase for Indulgent-
Guitar-Solos-R-Us but sadly lacking
in any kind of imaginative spandex
on the part of Justin ‘I don’t act like
a dick, I just am a dick’ Hawkins,
50% of their hits were over within
the first two songs. I’m not sure that
one gimmicky album, a sad failure
at a Christmas number one and
lacklustre fireworks should consti-
tute a headline act.
Saturday
Following an extended and incoher-
ent poetry session, the New York
Dolls treated us to an inoffensive if
unstirring set of slightly mellowed
punk, including the delicately cov-
ered Take Another Little Piece Of
My Heart. It was an adequate kick-
off to ‘Festival of Discomfort’ Day
Two.
The Mercury Prize winning Franz
Ferdinand live experience was a
smooth and polished affair, to the
point where, upon closing my eyes,
I almost believed I was back in my
bedroom in pyjamas rather than
muddy jeans. I was glad to hear the
extended version of Take Me Out,
and with cute explanations as to the
meaning of each track, I watched
with a smile on my face and a mod-
erate boogie in my hips.
Watching Morrissey is simply
magic. This man, his band, and the
ten foot letters spelling his name
sparkle. As the sun set, Morrissey
provided a relaxed, melodic, and
charming selection of songs. He
talked of his dislike for Radio One
and small British towns that issue
illicit speeding tickets, but even this
was done in a soothing and persua-
sive manner. Recent single First Of
The Gang To Die was the festival
high point, with the whole crowd
singing their lungs out. 55,000 peo-
ple can’t be wrong.
In the past year, The White Stripes
haven’t released a new album, had
a number one single or toured the
world. So how did they manage to
move up the bill from the penulti-
mate slot they occupied (and pulled
out of) last year? Scraping the bot-
tom of the band barrel methinks?
I enjoy The White Stripes in a CD
capacity. Their sound is unique and
they are undoubtedly clever musi-
cians. However the lack of band-
members, means their live per-
formance will always be limited. In
a set a little too concerned with
self-important solos, their real gems
were drowned out with the excep-
tion of Jolene, but then they didn’t
write that anyway.
Sunday
Maybe the bottling of The Rasmus
was the crowd’s effort to accelerate
the coming of the Dropkick Murphys.
With the emphasis on good old fash-
ioned DM stomping Irish punk fun,
the Boston boys certainly brought
their share of diverse instruments,
guest vocalists, heartfelt dedica-
tions, band members crowd surfing,
and honeys from the audience danc-
ing on stage. Energetic, traditional,
and certainly well liked.
The Streets are never on quite late
enough at Reading. Consequently,
this year MC Mike Skinner was
forced to lead a somewhat baffled
crowd: “See, we can mix dance
and rock if you jump on the spot
like this!” he coaxed – and to some
effect. With a good mix of the old and
the new, and reserving the finger-
shaking classic Don’t Mug Yourself
for the end, I think on this occasion
they pulled it off.
Placebo may be regarded as fes-
tival fodder but it certainly does
bring out the best in them. Sporting
a new, less glam look, Brian Molko
was at once a childlike and alluring
front man. The set itself was per-
fectly conceived and full of forgot-
ten favourites including the under-
stated Scared Of Girls. Heartfelt,
moody, beautifully performed and
crowned with the lately neglected
Nancy Boy, this was Placebo in
their full glory.
If the Reading Festival was a foot-
ball game, 50 Cent would be man
of the match. Hours in advance
of his performance, skinny, smug,
straggly haired adolescents with
toggled combats had been collect-
ing... bottles. Sidekick G Unit had
barely hit the stage when the sky
was filled like a sea of plastic, yet
what’s this? 50 Cent hurling bottles
straight back, except his are still
full! Brilliant! Drama still continuing
and the Cent-meister still grinning,
the few fans present were treated to
a selection of hits before someone
threw a chair at the stage. As it
turned out, this was the straw that
broke the camel’s back.
If every American was a fan of
punk rock music, Bush would have
been overthrown long ago in some
sort of spiky, tartan trouser-based
coup. Tonight, Green Day were fly-
ing the flag for the Anti-Dubya con-
sortium, riding on the back of new
album American Idiot. It had all the
ingredients of a classic Green Day
gig: an impromptu band formation
with ironic drummer Marc ‘the Kid’
Orrell (guitarist with the Dropkick
Murphys) and some kid called
Barney-as-in-the-dino on guitar, a
predictably silly costume to accom-
pany King For A Day, and an evenly
mixed array of songs to represent
their back catalogue. A meaning-
ful but not overbearing outing from
a band that rightly deserved the
accolade of ending the festival. In
a weekend of The Darkness, Green
Day were truly a beacon of light.

ALBUM REVIEW
It’s very easy to review an album
that’s really good. It’s even easier
to review an album that’s crap, as
you can just focus on all the things
that are shite. But to write about an
album which isn’t amazing and isn’t
crap but somewhere in between is
harder. Let’s Bottle Bohemia, the
second album by The Thrills, is just
such an album. They’ve chosen not
to change the winning formula of
So Much For The City and if you
didn’t like that one, you won’t like
this either.
I can easily imagine people whing-
ing about it being “samey”, because
it is, but that’s not necessarily a bad
thing. It’s not the best album of the
year, I won’t have nightmares about
the disc being scratched, but I may
well cause dogs to howl in pain by
singing along to the lyrics. In a cou-
ple of years’ time I’ll still be playing
it and that’s what it’s all about. It’s
a good album, with good songs, and
strong lyrics. Whatever Happened
to Corey Haim will happily stick in
your mind along with most of the
other tracks.
The Beach Boy cheeriness of So
Much For The City has taken a
backseat to some excellent Coldplay-
esque melancholy, most notably in
Not For All The Love In The World.
There’s even a bit of soul searching
about the ups and downs of fame
in You Can’t Fool Old Friends With
Limousines. In essence, it sounds
just like The Thrills always have
– if you like them, you’ll love this
record.
