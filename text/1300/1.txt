Imperial College Union cards
are no longer being issued to
students, but a large propor-
tion of freshers and return-
ing students were unaware of
the change when arriving at
College this week.
Swipe cards will now take
over all the functions of the
old Union cards, with new
electronic card readers being
installed where necessary.
In the past, the cards were
issued so that the Union
could collect essential infor-
mation about its members.
They were also seen as a
good marketing tool, attract-
ing students to come to the
Union and also giving them
the chance to obtain certain
student discounts.
However, printing several
thousand Union cards each
year can become an expen-
sive operation, and it is incon-
venient for students to have
to queue for long periods to
obtain one.
Now, with the introduction
of a new computer system,
the College Registry is able
to provide the Union with the
data it needs, and the market-
ing issue was thought to have
been dealt with by an agree-
ment to put the Union logo
onto College swipe cards.
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, told
Felix: “The idea of a joint
College and Union card has
been floated for a long time,
and I think most people would
agree that it is sensible.”
However,CollegeCommuni-
cations have since refused to
put the Union logo onto swipe
cards, saying that they need
more time to consider the
implications of such a change.
It is thought that other organ-
isations or groups might
wish to follow suit, leaving
the swipe cards covered with
several different logos.
The confusion appears
to have been caused by the
short timescale in which the
decision was taken – it only
became clear during the sum-
mer that the Registry would
have the required infor-
mation. The decision was
taken in the absence of the
President, and without the
input of the Union’s Executive
Committee. The change was
not mentioned in the Union
handbook or publicised at all
until a late stage approaching
the beginning of term.
Mr Arif continued: “It’s ben-
eficial to students if they don’t
have to have a separate Union
card. But if it looks like a last
minute rush job that hasn’t
been done in the most rigor-
ous manner, that’s probably
because it is.” He added that
he is in the process of setting
up a working group within
the College to consider the
issue of student identification
further.
Nightline, the charity pro-
viding a confidential listen-
ing service for students, has
had its logo removed from the
back of all new swipe cards.
Sam Rorke, Imperial College
Union’s Deputy President
(Education and Welfare),
said: “It was handy to have
the details on the back of the
swipe card, because it provid-
ed a quick and easy reference
so that those in distress could
get help quickly.”
Imperial students will not
obtain University of London
Union (ULU) cards either.
Again, the College swipe card
will be acceptable instead.
Funding changes
The Secretary of State has
proposed changes to the
university funding system
in order to preserve science
departments that might oth-
erwise close.

“Quality is surely more
