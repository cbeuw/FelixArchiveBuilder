INTERVIEWS
This year’s Music Of Black Origin
(MOBO) Awards had been rife with
problems from the outset. The gay
rights group OutRage accused the
organisers of supporting homopho-
bic artists Elephant Man and Vybz
Kartel. The two Jamaican reggae
stars were later dropped from the
nominations, partly due to their lyr-
ics inciting homophobia, but mainly
because of their refusal to apologise
for them. This, however, upset the
Black Music Council, who protested
on the night, waving banners in the
air reading “Defend Reggae Music”
and “Enraged by OutRage!”. They
also booed celebrities and inces-
santly chanted to the beat of the
bongos. This didn’t seem to dampen
the spirits of the stars, though.
The other major upset at the
awards was the number of American
urban artists who dropped out from
appearing. Most notably among
these was Pharrell Williams, from
N*E*R*D and The Neptunes,
who had been down to host the
awards. Rap artist and actor Mos
Def stepped in at the last minute
to take his place. Others who had
been scheduled to appear but
didn’t show up included Beyoncé,
Christina Milian, Usher and man
of the moment Kanye West, who
received a record seven nomina-
tions this year.
Somehow on the night I managed
to get into the press area, loaded
with recording equipment for IC
Radio, standing right beside the red
carpet awaiting the stars’ arrival.
Eventually they did turn up to the
Awards, despite all of the above set
backs. Among those who came were
Olympic champion Kelly Holmes,
Caroline Chikezie (who plays Sasha
in T4’s As If), Lulu, Myleen Klass,
Fearne Cotton and Reggie from Top
of the Pops and, of course, Tara
Palmer-Tompkinson as well as a
whole host of minor celebrities who
I and many of the other press peo-
ple failed to recognise. I managed
to chat to a few of the nominated
artists.
First up was Estelle, London’s
feisty new queen of hip-hop. She’d
already grabbed the urban scene’s
attention with 1980 in July and was a
hotly tipped favourite to win the Best
British Newcomer award, which she
later scooped that night. I asked
her who she was most looking for-
ward to see perform, to which she
promptly replied “Mary J Blige”,
America’s long running queen of
RnB. “I saw her doing rehearsals
earlier and she was… hot.” Estelle
also mentioned her new single Free,
which is out this week and fea-
tures previous MOBO winner Miss
Dynamite in the video.
A relative newcomer to the
British-Asian music scene, Raghav
was up for Best Collaboration, with
2Play for the chart-topping single So
Confused against the likes of Brandy
featuring Kanye West, Usher fea-
turing Lil John & Ludacris, Twista
featuring Kanye West & Jamie Foxx
and Marques Houston featuring
Joe Budden & Pied Piper. Raghav
seemed very enthused about being
at the award ceremony but was not
confident about winning: “I don’t
know. All the other guys are much
more well-known and easier to say
than me.” But against all the odds,
he did win the award. Raghav also
told me that he’s currently work-
ing hard on promoting his current
album Storyteller, which came out
early last month, and that the next
single to be taken from it is a “really
lovely track”.
Also at the awards, nominated
in the Best Jazz category, was
pint-sized Jamie Cullum. I asked
him if he had considered filling in
Pharrell’s shoes to host the awards,
since he’d covered Pharrell’s only
solo single Frontin’. Jamie jokingly
replied: “No man can fill his shoes…
not me. He’s a size nine.” Jamie
also let slip that he was “really
hungry. I haven’t eaten anything, so
I’ll be looking to eat and drink a lot
tonight”. On that note I wished him
good luck. Later in the evening, he
picked up the award for Best Jazz,
defeating the likes of Norah Jones
and Amy Winehouse.
Flying the flag for the US were
Brandy and Janet Jackson. Janet
didn’t do any interviews but later
presented Anita Baker with her
lifetime achievement award. Mario
Winans also showed up, though he
was unaware that I Don’t Wanna
Know had been nominated for
Best Ringtone, which he later won.
Neither did he know how successful
that single was over here. “People
should tell me these things,” he said.
When asked about all the big names
that dropped out, he defended his
fellow Americans, stating that these
things happen all the time at award
ceremonies due to scheduling and
busy workloads. This was also the
opinion of Lemar, who was up for
two awards but sadly didn’t receive
any. He was keen to mention his
new single and album, both of which
are coming out in November.
Not all the artists who came along
to the MOBO Awards were nominat-
ed. I spoke to Rishi Rich, a British
producer who has worked with the
likes of Britney Spears, Craig David,
Mary J Blige and Liberty X as well as
being part of the Rishi Rich Project,
who brought us Eyes On You this
summer and features rapper Jay
Sean. Rishi talked to me about his
upcoming album as well as working
on Jay Sean’s album, both of which
he’s looking forward to. In response
to many of the American artists not
showing up, he said: “Yeah, I think
that could help some of our British
artists get exposure tonight.”
Quite a few British breakthrough
artists were hoping for that as well.
These included Nina Jayne, who
had previously won the MOBO
UnSung award in 2001 under the
guise of N’Jay. The UnSung com-
petition tries to find and recognise
new urban talent in the UK by
touring the country. Nina has now
signed to BMG and was very much
looking forward to her debut album
getting released. Another new artist
I spoke to at the awards was Rhian
Benson, whose debut single Say
How I Feel is out this week. Rhian’s
music is inspired by soul, reggae,
early Stevie Wonder and her roots in
Ghana. She was extremely excited
at being at her first MOBO awards.
The star of the night, though, was
Jamelia. As soon as she arrived,
Brandy rushed over to her and
they started joking with each other.
Jamelia won all three of the awards
she was nominated for, sharing UK
Act of the Year award with Dizzee
Rascal. This year has been particu-
larly successful for the 23-year-old,
following her comeback to the music
industry after putting her career on
hold for her daughter Teja, now
three. Jamelia’s next single to be
taken from her muti-platinum sell-
ing album Thank You is a track
called DJ, out on 1 November.

Metal-loving hamsters on drugs
ALBUM REVIEW
Imagine for a moment, if you will, a
hamster on a cocktail of metham-
phetamine, benzphetamine, phen-
termine, fenfluramine, mazindol,
ketamine, phendimetrazine, crack
cocaine, methcathinone and meth-
ylphenidate. Add to the equation a
Nintendo, several Casio keyboards
and an (un)healthy dose of helium.
Take away any sanity that may have
prevailed, record the result and then
play back at double speed. Got that?
Well, you’re still nowhere near
Especially Likely Sloth, yet that is the
best I can do to describe the group’s
sound. This is a project of Jason
William Walton, otherwise known for
his work with folk/extreme metal
bands Agalloch and Sculptured. The
music, however, is truly deranged
electronica. In my experience But
If What He’ll What Ant has one of
two effects on the listener. The first
(which I fall victim to) is to sit, grin
manically, and start doing every-
thing at twice the speed while try-
ing to squeak along. The friends I
played it to, however, threatened to
scratch off their ears if I didn’t turn
it off, calling it disturbing, scary and
generally too weird.
As such, this release is very
much an acquired taste. The
music revolves around insanely
catchy melodies played on game-
console sounding keyboards, with
an abundance of Simpsons sam-
ples and extremely high-pitched
vocals. Some more organic-sound-
ing strings fit surprisingly well, as
do their disharmonies. Occasional
calypso-sounding sections help cre-
ate an even more mind-expanding
listen, and tinny drums complete the
experience. Crystal clear produc-
tion makes every bizarre note and
nuance of the music unavoidable
(for those still naively attempting to
cling to their sanity by trying not to
listen).
But If What He’ll What Ant comes
highly recommended to fans of truly
off-kilter music, but is perhaps one
to avoid for less adventurous listen-
ers. Oh, and it’s also more addictive
– I would imagine – than metham-
phetamine, benzphetamine, phen-
termine, fenfluramine, mazindol,
ketamine, phendimetrazine, crack
cocaine, methcathinone and methyl-
phenidate put together.
