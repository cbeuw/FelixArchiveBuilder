As the Hunting Bill was
being debated in the House
of Commons last month, a
number of past and present
Imperial College students
were involved in the protests
outside.
The Wye Beagles (formerly
the Wye College Beagles) are
an amateur and young per-
sons’ pack with close links to
the Wye campus and the stu-
dents’ union. Six of the cur-
rent hunt staff and committee
are either current Imperial
students or graduates of the
College.
Kirsty Massey, joint mas-
ter of the Beagles and about
to start a Masters course at
Wye, told Felix why she took
part in the rally in Parliament
Square: “We need to show
people opposed to hunting
that we have not given up
and will not take a ban lying
down.”
Henry Walker, a former stu-
dent master and huntsman,
expressed his fondness for
hunting and his frustration at
the ban: “The first time I saw
the Wye College pack was on
a rainy day during Freshers
Week. From that point on, I
was hooked. Everyone was
very friendly and what struck
me was that everyone had a
genuine love for the country-
side.” Mr Walker continued:
“I have been to every London
rally and hunt protest for the
last six years. What will we
have to do before they listen
to us?”
As the Bill was being
debated, hunt supporters
fought with police outside.
Some invaded the House
of Commons, prompting
calls for drastic changes to
Parliamentary security meas-
ures.
The Bill was passed by
356 votes to 166. It is now
almost certain to become
law through the Parliament
Act, with an official ban set to
begin in summer 2006.
Unsurprisingly, the Wye
Beagles are not ready to
admit defeat on an issue
about which so many of their
members feel so strongly.
However, other students
and societies at Imperial are
likely to support the hunting
ban.
Coincidentally, several sen-
ior Imperial College Union
officers were inside Portcullis
House at the time, and were
asked whether or not they
supported the Bill. Most
replied “no”, citing the exist-
ence of the Wye Beagles as
the main reason why.
“What will we
have to do
before they
listen to us?”

Government
intervenes
in university
science
funding
By Emily Gwyer
The Secretary of State for
Education and Skills, Charles
Clarke, this week proposed
changes to the current sys-
tem of university funding in
order to preserve the teach-
ing of science in departments
that might otherwise close.
The last ten years have
seen a dramatic drop in the
number of students enrolled
on science courses in Britain,
particularly the physical sci-
ences, and the market-led
approach to university fund-
ing has meant that several
departments, such as the
Kings College chemistry
department, have had to
close.
Mr Clarke believes that
producing science under-
graduates is of significant
importance to the economy
and has therefore proposed
new changes to the funding
system whereby new subsi-
dies are levied or tuition fees
waived.
The news has been wel-
comed by the scientific com-
munity, which has been lob-
bying Mr Clarke over the
matter, but his plans will
require the agreement of
vice-chancellors, who may
see Government intervention
as unwelcome. The process,
bound to be long and tortur-
ous, has only just begun, but
we wait with interest to see
if Britain’s future science
students are rewarded with
extra money.

Fears were raised this week
of a new epidemic of measles
in London, as government sci-
entists warned parents about
the extremely low take-up of
the MMR vaccine.
London has the lowest
immunisation rate in the
country, with fewer than 62%
of babies having had the jab
in south London and in other
boroughs including Haringey
and Tower Hamlets. 95% of
the population must be immu-
nised against a disease in
order to reduce the chances
of two non-immunised peo-
ple meeting each other to
practically zero (this is called
‘herd immunity’). Without this
immunity, certain groups, par-
ticularly primary school chil-
dren, are at risk of contract-
ing the disease, which can
be fatal. Up to 20% of adult
sufferers are hospitalised.
The controversy over the
MMR vaccine began in 1998,
when Dr Andrew Wakefield
of the Royal Free Hospital
published an article in The
Lancet discussing bowel dis-
ease and autism. In the press
conference for the article, Dr
Wakefield went further and
suggested a link between
the vaccine and the onset of
autism. Although the sample
group of 12 children was far
smaller than previous stud-
ies (which had shown no ill
effects), it was explosive.
Natural parental fears
over risks to their children
were matched with serious
mistrust of government sci-
entists, and the newspapers
stirred up the panic. Take-up
of the triple vaccine has fallen
from 92% before the press
conference to the current low
of 68%, despite many other
studies failing to repeat the
findings of Dr Wakefield. This
was followed by ten of the
paper’s co-authors retracting
their names from the article
and Dr Wakefield’s subse-
quent resignation.
Many parents remain wor-
ried, bamboozled by the sci-
ence and angry about the pat-
ronising attitude of govern-
ment officials. An epidemic is
now a serious possibility.
Measles symptoms begin
with fever before a rash
appears, usually on the head
and then spreading to the
body. After three to five days,
the spots may blend into each
other as the illness progress-
es. Students are not at as high
a risk as young children.

Fears of new measles epidemic in London
