The playwright Christopher Marlowe was stabbed to death at a house in Deptford in 1593, apparently in a
drunken brawl. Louise Welsh’s second novel, while a work of fiction, follows the more recent speculation that
his killing has more to do with political intrigue. Martin Cansdale explains why Tamburlaine Must Die

This book, the author’s second
novel, is a fictional account of the
last days of Christopher Marlowe.
Tamburlaine is the eponymous
character of a Marlowe play
which tells of the fourteenth cen-
tury Mongol warlord’s bloody rise
to power. In Welsh’s story, bills are
being pasted up all over London,
threatening a massacre of immi-
grants in the city. As they refer
to Marlowe’s plays and are signed
‘Tamburlaine’, the authorities are
quick to accuse the unfortunate
writer. All that saves Marlowe from
immediate punishment is the inter-
vention of Lord Cecil, the Queen’s
spymaster, for whom Marlowe has
worked. In an effort to save his own
life, he must hunt for the real culprit
in a plague-stricken London.
Despite a fair sprinkling of poetry,
and having a playwright for its hero
and narrator, this book doesn’t get
bogged down in literary pretensions.
Any references to Marlowe’s works
are explained, and the fast-moving
story is based around his life as a
spy rather than a writer.
The narrative style of this book
reminded me of Alistair MacLean.
This may seem strange. What can
a tale set in the sixteenth century
have in common with the work of
a great writer of twentieth century
adventure thrillers? Quite a lot, as
the period setting for Welsh’s novel
sits rather oddly with the tone of the
writing. Some passages could come
straight from the pages of Where
Eagles Dare, such as: “I thought I
felt the prickle of surveillance on
my shoulders. And though I knew it
was most likely the effect of my own
blood running faster in my veins,
I made my way from the crush of
people, trying to keep note of who
was around me, checking to see if
any faces lingered in the thinning
crowd.”
Tamburlaine Must Die does break
one of MacLean’s rules, though.
He included very little sex in his
stories, for fear of hindering the
action, whereas this book has two
main sexual interludes. Both mix
startlingly direct and blunt descrip-
tions with embarrassingly vague
euphemisms. The first liaison, with
Marlowe’s patron, is presumably
intended to show something about
the relationship between the two
men. Coming just a dozen pages
in and being dealt with in a seem-
ingly embarrassed rush, it does lit-
tle more than puzzle.
Indeed, the brevity of the book as
a whole is a weakness. At around
25,000 words, this is more novella
than novel. There is no room for
more of the scene setting, plot twist-
ing, and character development that
the author seems to do so well. Sub-
plots are introduced and promise
interest but then come to nothing.
For all this criticism, the book is
still very enjoyable to read. Welsh
builds an exciting picture of the
noisy capital in a series of busy,
crowded, descriptive passages, all
benefiting from the voice and views
of Marlowe as narrator.
Perhaps as a consequence of its
shortness, the narrative is exhilarat-
ingly fast-paced. The plot, although
relatively simple and not following
some temptingly suggested twists, is
exciting enough. Although Marlowe
is the only character that is really
developed, this is done well, and
interest in his struggle is the main
strength of the book.
If Tamburlaine Must Die was
twice the length, with all the inter-
esting detours that it continually
promises, it would be a very good
book. That aside, it’s still well writ-
ten, gripping, and at 149 pages won’t
get in the way of work for very long.

Teaching an Oldboy new tricks...
15 years forced to live in a cell, five days to seek revenge

If you thought Sympathy For Mr
Vengeance was dark, you haven’t
seen anything yet. While Park Chan
Wook’s previous movie arguably had
some uplifting moments in the other-
wise unremitting darkness, Oldboy
takes everything down a step.
The movie follows the story of
Dae Su (Choi Min Sik), a completely
unremarkable city worker who goes
about his daily business, spending
time with his wife and daughter and
doing nothing out of the ordinary.
That is until one day, he is arrested
and charged with being drunk and
disorderly. Later that evening he is
released and fights his way home
through the sheet-like rain, stopping
only to telephone (and presumably,
grovel to) his wife. This is when
things start getting strange, as Dae-
Su is kidnapped and taken to a cell.
The run-down hotel-style prison
is his home for an ever-increasing
length of time, his only companion
a television, and his captor com-
pletely anonymous. He is fed only
fried dumplings, and is gassed into
unconsciousness every few months
for his room maintenance and
haircuts. With nothing else to do to
pass the time, the unlucky inmate
practices fighting (against a figure
drawn on his wall), formulates an
escape, and seethes hatred towards
his incarcerator.
In the masterfully condensed sub-
sequent years, Dae Su’s wife is mur-
dered and he is named the chief
suspect. Following some unsettling
hallucinatory scenes (leaving us in
no doubt that the captive is slowly
but surely losing his sanity), he is
gassed and wakes up on a rooftop,
a free man. In his new suit, he
finds a telephone, and on the other
end is Woo Jin (Yu Ji Tae), the rich
businessman behind fifteen years
of hellish, reasonless imprisonment.
Dae Su is given five days to work out
why. Falling for sushi bar girl Mi Do
(Kang Hye Jeong), Dae Su starts to
track down the captor, and a twisted,
perverse story unfolds.
Oldboy is gritty, unflinching and
brutal. Scenes of torture (think teeth
and a claw hammer) sit right along-
side the pitch black humour that
crops up from time to time. The
scene of Dae Su eating a live squid
has – perhaps thankfully, depending
upon your point of view – been cut
from the UK theatrical release (no
special effects are used: the squid
really is alive, and Choi Min Sik
really is eating it). Yet this should
give you an idea of the kind of thing
we are dealing with here.
The macabre content is so well
shot that it only serves to accentu-
ate the movie’s morose beauty. A
perfect example of this is the single-
shot, five minute fight scene, moving
up and down a corridor as Dae Su
fights off swathes of prison guards
with just his hammer. Subtle CGI
transitions and more apparent sec-
tions are well placed, and choppy
editing mirrors the main charac-
ter’s disorientation.
The often colour-washed shots and
gloomy settings provide an oppres-
sive atmosphere, making for a truly
emotionally effective and draining
film. This is aided by convincing
performances all around, which also
help make some of the plot’s less
realistic turns more believable. A
score that could initially seem com-
pletely inappropriate soon becomes
compelling in the extreme, and is
one of the film’s strongest points.
Themes include the driving savage-
ry of revenge and a bleak look at
ill-fated love.
There are flaws, such as the finale.
Following a climactic few minutes
of dramatic twists, building tension
and a superb ending, the film segues
into a rather unnecessary final coda,
losing the visceral impact of the pre-
ceding section.
However, minus the last ten min-
utes, Oldboy is an absolute classic.
Unforgiving yet human, brutal yet
beautiful, detached yet emotional,
it exemplifies all of the best aspects
of extreme cinema. In an age when
Hollywood is buying up every Asian
ghost movie on the market through
sheer lack of ideas, here is piece
that proves how creative some film-
makers can still be.
A must-see for extreme and world
cinema fans.
