The European Social Forum is coming to London
Away from home for the first time?
For many of you, this may be the
first time in your life that you have
spent a substantial amount of time
away from your home, friends and
family. If this is the case, you may
well be loving the freedom that com-
ing to university gives you, however
some of you might be feeling the
total opposite.
You may be feeling lonely, finding
it hard to settle in the local area
and just feeling generally unhappy.
If you are feeling like this, you may
well be homesick.
There are many causes of home-
sickness, including:
● the distance away from home
● things not being what you expect-
ed, in your course or the local area.
● heavy workload
● a feeling of anticlimax – perhaps
coming to university wasn’t as good
an experience as you thought.
If you are feeling like this, there
are ways to get over it and there are
people out there who can help you.
It might help to talk things through
with someone you trust – this could
be a personal tutor, a friend, a coun-
sellor, a chaplain, a member of your
family or a student adviser.
Another way of combating home-
sickness is to make a real effort to
join societies and activities. This is
a great way of meeting new people
and may help you to feel less home-
sick. To find out more about student
activities, please contact casa@ic.
ac.uk.
Try to establish a routine during
your time here – the more time you
spend doing things, the less time
you spend thinking about home.
Give yourself a bit of time to get
through it. Sometimes people make
a rash decision to leave university
and then regret it afterwards. When
I first went to college, I hated it, but
I said that I would give it six weeks
and ended up having the best years
of my life so far.
Be realistic about what to expect
from your time at university – there
will obviously be good and bad
times.
If you still feel down and upset
even after trying to resolve these
issues then you should seek help
from a professional. The College
provides a free counselling service
and of course there is the Union
Advice Service which can also help.
If you would like further informa-
tion or have any questions about
homesickness or any other topic,
please contact the Imperial College
Union Advice Service on 020 7594
8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.

Hopefully you have all (almost) sur-
vived Freshers Week. You’ll there-
fore be starting to get an appre-
ciation for what Imperial College is
like, the unique culture of this insti-
tution and it’s vibrant student body
(demonstrated so magnificently at
the Freshers Fair).
I’m on the radio
Starting tonight (Thursday) is the
first weekly Fireside show at 6pm
on IC Radio.
What’s IC Radio? It’s your award-
winning student radio station, at
www.icradio.com. Imperial College
Union plays host to some of the
most dynamic media societies
thanks to our state of the art Media
Centre.
Anyway, the Fireside show will fea-
ture the Felix editor and myself live
on air. We’ll start with a Presidential
address on the week’s big stories
(generally the Felix front page), and
then it’ll be your chance to phone
in and ask questions. Ask anything
you like. The future of fox hunting
at Wye, the legality of that obscure
society you find offensive, my views
on euthanasia, what underwear I’m
wearing... the possibilities are end-
less!
Elections: STAND
You will have noticed, I hope, that
elections are happening and there
are plenty of representative posi-
tions to stand for, especially for
postgraduates. Please do consider
standing for election if you think you
can represent your peers.
Representation is important. It’s
ultimately the most important rea-
son for the Union to exist. Students
come to College first and foremost
to have a good education (in all
aspects, such as extra-curricular,
not just on their degree course).
The job of the Union is to ensure
that the College delivers on this
commitment and also to ensure that
provision is improved for the future
when decisions are being made by
College authorities.
The College is going through
a period of change. Most of the
senior academic leadership of the
College (Pro Rectors and Faculty
Principals) are new, and they will
want to leave their mark in a big way.
This year, the College is also going
through a an educational quality
audit from the Quality Assurance
Agency (QAA), who are responsible
for ensuring that teaching quality is
maintained. The QAA will, as part
of their audit, solicit a submission
from the Union. Ultimately many
changes, if they improve things, can
be beneficial to students, and the
Union can play a very positive part
in the change process.
For students to benefit, however,
the Union must be representative
– that is to say that the views it
voices must genuinely reflect the
grass roots views of the students.
The only way that can happen is if
a sufficiently large proportion of the
student body participates in the vot-
ing process.
Anyway, enough of my inane
ramblings. Go to www.union.ic.ac.
uk/elections. Now. Please. Pretty
please. With a cherry on top.
Doughnuts
Regular readers will recall that last
year I wrote about the best places
to purchase doughnuts. Those with
better memories will remember
that I suggested Tesco as the best
value place to go. Following further
doughnut investigations, I would
like to confirm that I no longer
consider this a sensible option. I
no longer feel that guzzling down
a pack of 10 doughnuts in one go is
sensible.
Quality is surely more impor-
tant than quantity. To that end, the
dairy cream filled chocolate coated
doughnuts at Miss Ellie’s in South
Kensington station come highly rec-
ommended. But if you really want
to treat yourself, go to the Harrods
Food Hall (only for special occa-
sions, but you do get to ‘try’ one for
free if you say that you haven’t had
one before!) Don’t forget the milk
shake.
Finally...
The Union is here to serve you. I
know I wrote this last week, but
it’s worth saying again. If you think
there is something we are doing
wrong or have ideas for things we
could do better, please do not hesi-
tate to get in touch. My office is on
the first floor of the Union Building
and I’m always happy to make time
to see students, as are the rest of
the team.
So, the European Social Forum
(ESF) is coming to London. But
what actually is the ESF, and why
should we, as students of Imperial
College, care? Well, that is what I
am going to try to explain, as well as
why I believe it is important for as
many students as possible to attend
the event, which is being held in
Alexandra Palace and Bloomsbury
on 15–17 October.
The ESF is described as ‘the larg-
est gathering in British history’
– tens of thousands of people, from
every background imaginable, will
be gathering in London under the
phrase ‘Another World is Possible’,
to debate and discuss how to get
there. It will be focused around
six major themes: war and peace;
democracy and fundamental rights;
social justice and solidarity; corpo-
rate globalisation and global justice;
against racism, discrimination and
the far right; environmental crisis
and a sustainable planet.
Theeventwillseenon-governmen-
tal organisations, religious groups,
socialists, environmentalists, trade
unionists, anti-capitalists and many
other groups ending with ‘-ists’ com-
ing together for a festival for global
justice for all. Speakers include Dr
Aleida Guevara (Che’s daughter),
Muslim writer Tariq Ramadan, third
world debt expert Susan George,
and many others including John
Pilger and Tony Benn. But the ESF
isn’t just about meetings. The event
will also feature film showings, such
as those introduced by Ken Loach,
and music, with a huge anti-fascist
concert one evening. On the final
day, there will be a massive interna-
tional anti-war demonstration, end-
ing in Trafalgar Square with former
Algerian president and anti-colonial
resistance leader Ahmed Ben Bella
introducing the classic film Battle of
Algiers, with a new score performed
by Asian Dub Foundation.
Two years ago, when the ESF was
held in Florence, Italy, the Italian
universities were forced to close
due to the vast numbers of students
attending the event. The scale of
the ESF is clearly huge, and we
are very privileged to have it right
here on our doorstep. No doubt the
size of the ESF will soon become
apparent, with some of our clubs
and societies getting involved in
promoting it.
I am a great believer in the idea
that Imperial College Union should
not isolate itself from the ‘real
world’ out there, and in no area is
this more important than in wel-
fare. Every welfare issue we face in
College will be rooted or mirrored
in the wider world. And the more
of us that attend the ESF and take
part in debates on welfare issues
on a global scale, the more we will
be united and prepared to tackle
welfare issues on campus, whether
they be the individual and personal
problems that any one of us may
face, or the ongoing fights against
top-up fees and increases in hall
rents.
Another world is possible. Let’s
start to find out how.
