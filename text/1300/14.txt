CLUB REVIEW
Layo & Bushwacka (aka Layo
Paskin and Matt ‘Bushwacka’ B)
are a formidable duo on the club
scene. They’ve both been involved
since the early days, and as a pro-
duction duo since the mid-nineties.
Layo is co-founder of The End with
Mr C, and the pair met through him,
so this place is like their home.
The monthly residency, All Night
Long (also the name of a brilliant
double mix CD by the pair), is one
of the finest nights out in town and
has a firm following. This really
isn’t surprising when you consider
the club’s reputation, plus the fact
that tonight both the lounge and the
main room are as one, filled with the
sounds of Layo & Bushwacka for
eight hours straight, right through
the night. To add to the fun, this
was the first time they’d been back
at The End since the summer, their
last event being the All Night Long
boat party – a club night on the
Thames!
Entering via the attached AKA
bar, where Sancho Panza were
already rocking with a selection of
dirty disco house, I descended into
the club to find, as you’d expect,
the place already heaving with rev-
ellers. Describing the people you
find here is tricky, as there’s always
quite a variety, but mostly everyone
is clued up, sexy and stylish. Moving
straight onto the dancefloor, I found
the music to be much the same.
Layo & Bushwacka play all sorts
of music, under the banner of house.
To the point and funky, their style
is always tight and crisp. Taking
in breakbeat tracks as well as 4x4
stuff, their mixes move through dif-
ferent vibes confidently and proudly.
This is DJing with none of the bulls-
hit – they don’t rely on popular, big
records to build the crowd, instead
showing off their prowess by show-
casing the hottest new tunes along
with their proven classics.
It’s easy to tell when a DJ is good
– just check out the crowd. Looking
around The End, you realise just
how good Layo and Bushwacka
are, as people are strutting their
stuff all over. Admittedly you might
find the dancing here slightly more
restrained and conservative than
at other places around the city, but
everyone here knows how to give
it some.
Happy, dancing people means
friendly people – there’s no atti-
tude here, and you’re quite likely to
strike up conversations with total
strangers just because you bumped
into each other on the dancefloor.
Spend some time chatting and you’ll
find all kinds of people from all
walks of life.
With the music captivating me,
and being egged on by the up-for-it
crowd, the dancefloor was where I
stayed for most of the night. When
you spend a lot of time on dance-
floors, one of the things you notice a
lot more is decor. The End is up with
the best in this respect too. The ceil-
ings are draped with thin webbing
to pick up the impressive lightshow,
creating a stylish blend of reds and
purples, a chic which suits the cli-
entele. One of the high points of the
night was an inspired mix of Minnie
Riperton’s Loving You. It may seem
a bit odd, but I can tell you that it
worked a treat, bringing the dance-
floor to a standstill and prompting
everyone to sing along.
Overall, All Night Long was as
good as it always is – down to earth,
like-minded people, and down to
earth, solid, funky music.

RAVE REVIEW
The history of dance music in the
UK is long, dating back to the mid-
eighties when electronic instru-
ments and the new-found desire to
dance until dawn combined, result-
ing in one of the most creative and
exciting times in British music.
Raindance has been around
almost as long as dance music itself
– it was the first fully licensed all
night event in the UK, at a time
when illegal raves were the place to
be, and club culture as we know it
didn’t exist.
Now, 15 years on, Raindance is still
going strong, holding four events
per year. These usually take place in
London, and recently Raindance has
found it’s home at seOne. Previously
known as SE1, and before that The
Drome, seOne is situated in the
tunnels underneath London Bridge
Station. This makes for a fantastic
venue with a genuine underground
feel. Each room (or ‘arch’) is made
by dividing the brick tunnels, giving
the place a sense of closeness and
intimacy, whilst making it very easy
to get lost and discover a room you
haven’t been into yet at 4am. seOne
is not a small place, however, with a
capacity of around 3000 (the same
as superclub Fabric). Some people
used to complain that The Drome
was no more than an “overpriced
squat”, but the current manage-
ment have done a lot to improve the
place – the walls are painted and
the bare concrete floors have been
given a new foot-friendly surface.
Approaching the venue, it was
clear that this was going to be a
sell-out. Luckily we acquired tickets
beforehand – a lot of people were
turned away at the door – though we
still had to queue for quite a while
to pick our tickets up, then again
to get in, and once more for the
cloakroom. By 1am we were ready
to explore and made our way around
the arches.
With the history that goes with
Raindance, so the music policy cov-
ers the past 15 years of dance music.
The Jenkins Lane (where the first
Raindance was held) Reunion arch
plays host to the oldest and slowest
music. This is house in its embry-
onic form – sparse synthesisers
and drum machines with sampled
drum breaks and stolen vocals. Just
because it’s old and relatively slow
when compared to modern dance
music doesn’t mean it’s not good.
This kind of music always has pas-
sion and sounds great: chunky
basslines, resonating piano melo-
dies and jingling, perpetual percus-
sion.
Moving on, we found that the
next (and the biggest) arch was
the main Old Skool arch. Here, the
music is taken from the next point
in dance’s evolution. This is faster
and harder than before. The beats
are more pounding, the sounds and
samples crazier, and the breaks
more euphoric. The emphasis with
this kind of music is on making
people dance fast and hard, then
scream and reach for the lasers
in the breakdowns. No matter how
old it is, this kind of hardcore still
sounds fresh, original and banging
to the objective ear.
Next, on to the third arch: Jungle
and Drum & Bass. A lot of drum &
bass events around London come
with a whole lot of attitude includ-
ed, but just because the music is
dark and ominous doesn’t mean the
crowd have to be. At Raindance, the
Jungle and D&B room proved this –
happy people, moving like mad and
making all the noise they can with
their mouths, horns and whistles.
The fourth and final arch was
the fastest and most extreme: the
Hardcore arch. This is really quite
insane music – think of the standard
cheesy dance crap you hear on the
radio, then speed it up by half as
much again. Relentless rhythms at
breakneck speed, squeaky vocals,
sparkling pianos and twisted
basslines all come together to make
a wall of sound that is unmatched in
its intensity and energy. Needless to
say, the Hardcore Arch was by far
the hottest and sweatiest, and the
crowd here were moving a lot more
than in any of the other arches.
As the night rolled on, I hardly
noticed the time passing. Legendary
DJ Kevin Energy (part of the Nu-
NRG producer collective/record
label) absolutely destroyed the
Hardcore arch, with his freeform
style encompassing happy hardcore,
jungle, drum and bass, gabba and
anything hard, energetic and fast.
When I say destroy, I really mean
it – people were hugging speakers,
screaming, and moving so fast that
the sweat was literally flying.
All the arches at Raindance have
MCs. Whether this is a good or bad
thing is a question of taste; the main
Old Skool arch was advertised as
‘75% MC free’. Personally I do enjoy
some MCing, but sometimes, and
with less vocally dextrous artists, it
can become slightly annoying. Not
here, though – everyone I heard on
the mic had enough skill to rouse the
crowd without spoiling the tunes.
With much bouncing in and
between the arches, the rest of the
night passed with the usual profu-
sion of random exchanges with even
more random people (you tend to
meet some very interesting ones
at events like these), 8am rolled
around soon enough, and I was left
wanting more. The afterparty, in yet
more arches, continued until 1pm.
