JCR food
Dear Dave,
Might I suggest that the people
who devise menus for the JCR at
lunchtime just take the next logical
step, and offer a menu with only two
items: bits of chicken whose sole
evolutionary purpose is to become
“chicken nuggets”, and “overcooked
stuff”.
In case you’re wondering about the
second item on my proposed menu,
it’s simply a description of today’s
JCR offering – broccoli with a hint
of salmon gills (cunningly adver-
tised as “Salmon Shanty”), a side
offering of sweetcorn that somehow
continued to cling to the cob despite
being boiled into a mushy pulp, and
a slice of lemon that some genius
had chucked on top of each “shanty”
before putting the whole lot in the
oven.
Alternatively, they could just
sub-contract everything out to the
Sandwich Shoppe on Gloucester
Road (or maybe employ people who
know how to cook).
Yours,
Etienne Pollard
PS To be fair to the counter staff,
they did offer me an apple when I
complained.
