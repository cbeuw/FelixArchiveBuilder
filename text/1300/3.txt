As the reader may have clev-
erly noticed from the previ-
ous edition of Felix, there’s
a new face in town. Allow me
to introduce myself as the
new editor of the Business
section.
Having successfully con-
quered the first year, I am
about to embark on the
treacherous second year
of JMC (Joint Maths and
Computing). If I’m not writ-
ing for Felix in Beit Quad,
you’ll find me either hitting
the keyboard at the Huxley
labs or practising Tae Kwon
Do at Wilson House. With that
short intro out of the way, I
can now explain exactly what
I’ll be filling up these pages
with every week.
First and foremost, I urge
the reader, whatever your
business orientation may be,
to contribute to this fountain
of knowledge by offering any-
thing you deem appropriate.
If that means submitting a
review of a new bond offering,
the transcript of an interview
with a CEO or even a sales
pitch for the latest stock to
hit the market, I want to hear
from you.
My aim in all future issues
will be to give the reader
an insight into the previous
week’s events, what trig-
gered them and how this will
affect students at Imperial
especially.
Do bear in mind that a
whole week’s events are
being summarised in a frac-
tion of the space taken up
by a business newspaper
such as the Telegraph or the
Financial Times, so forgive
me if certain stories have
been sacrificed to make way
for others.
I look forward to hearing
from you – feel free to e-mail
me at the address below about
this article, future industry
scoops or anything at all that
you feel is worth considering.
I hope these pages will be as
enjoyable for you to read as
they are for me to write.
Below are the particulars
of just a few of the biggest
stories in the business world
over the past few weeks.

LandSec
A huge property securitisa-
tion deal was announced on
Monday last in a successful
attempt by Land Securities,
the UK’s largest property
company, to ease its debt
accumulation and increase
borrowing capacity.
The £2.4bn bond issue is the
result of a new (and clever)
refinancing agreement with
Lloyds Bank and Citigroup,
who will jointly underwrite the
issue. LandSec has decided
to exchange this bond issue
in favour to its existing unse-
cured bonds and mortgage
debentures, a form of debt
instrument, but without any
backing collateral. As a con-
sequence of this, the compa-
ny will save itself £24m a year
from interest charges alone,
and since Standard & Poor’s
debt rating for LandSec
has leaped from A- to AA, it
has increased its borrowing
strength considerably.
However, all is not rosy as
the firm will witness a deficit
of almost £700m in profits due
to an exceptional accounting
hit as a result of its refinanc-
ing deal.
Lazard
Lazard, the only private
partnership in global invest-
ment banking and one of the
world’s most pre-eminent
firms, is set to float on the
stock market by the end of
this week. For all you future
Lazard I-Bankers, now’s the
time to concentrate.
The 156-year-old bank’s
future lay last week at the
hands of Lazard’s chairman,
Michel David-Weill, and his
investing group, Eurazeo.
The man behind the IPO
push is Bruce Wasserstein,
the legendary investment
banker at Lazard who has
had continuing discussions
with the firm’s partners and
Weill to tempt them into
going public. However, given
Wasserstein’s success in the
past with selling Wasserstein,
Perella & Co to Dresdner
Bank in 2000, it is only expect-
ed that Wasserstein can see a
sale through the corner of
his eye to Deutsche Bank or
the Bank of America, both of
whom have given indications
of their interest in buying
Lazard. The firm’s success in
the past has been attributed
to the fact that it has decided
to specialise in giving merg-
ers and acquisitions advice to
large corporations as well as
having a small but success-
ful underwriting and trading
practice.
This success, though, can-
not continue without Lazard
expanding due to the ever-
increasing size of its main
competitors, Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
Dresdner KW.
Crude oil price surge
Urgent action is needed
to ensure that sky-high oil
prices do not derail the sta-
bility of the global economy,
the International Monetary
Foundation reported last
week. Crude oil, one of the
most rapidly rising commodi-
ties of all time, has been ris-
ing unexpectedly for over two
years now, due to almost a
dozen different factors.
Among the most influen-
tial of these were the threat
by Nigerian rebels to dis-
rupt supplies, a hurricane
in the Gulf of Mexico that
lowered output, and the fact
that China’s industry is now
guzzling 6.3m barrels a day,
second only to the US.
Now that the price of crude
oil futures has reached the
psychologically important $50
mark, consumers are start-
ing to feel the pinch more
than ever. But it is the less
technologically advanced oil
drilling and extraction indus-
tries who have actually been
hit hardest by this landmark
price. ChevronTexaco, for
instance, drilled the deep-
est well ever last year (four
miles), but the only differ-
ence it made to their balance
sheet was a $50m deficit, the
cost of the operation.
On the other hand, Pennzoil
Company, a much smaller
technologically advanced
firm, spent much of its
resources in pinpointing
exactly where in their global
fields the hidden sources of
oil and gas were. This strat-
egy paid off for Pennzoil, who
made $6.4bn when it sold
it’s richest fields to Union
Pacific Resources Group
Incorporated. So what can
we, Imperial students, learn
from this price rampage
that has shocked so many
and left thousands of smaller
businesses bust? Well, now
is definitely not the time to
buy a petrol-greedy Ferrari
Scaglietti!
The future
The future, the future.
Indeed if I could predict the
future I would have a dozen
Scaglietti’s in my assets port-
folio by now. Alas it is not so;
instead I propose the next
best thing, my predictions.
To think that the M&S saga
was over is foolish. It may
seem that Philip Green’s bid
for Marks & Spencer four
months ago was his last, but
insiders have revealed that
Green has approached HSBC
for additional funding. Up to
$1bn was being requested to
help finance his future takeo-
ver. That’s right, you heard it
here first: Green is planning
another takeover of M&S to
satisfy his fetish for retailers
and to add to his present col-
lection of Burton, BHS and
Arcadia.
“Lazard prepares to
defend a hostile takeover
from Deutsche Bank” has
a fair chance of making the
headlines next week. Given
Deutsche Bank’s recent fall
in mergers and acquisitions
revenues, this would be an
understandable move, as
Lazard is renowned world-
wide for it’s strength in merg-
ers and acquisitions advisory
services.
Latest from the Square Mile
With one very eventful week coming to a close on Sunday, you should anticipate some
shocking headlines in the next fortnight
Price perplexity: the value of crude oil is increasing by the day and these containers in Germany look set to empty
