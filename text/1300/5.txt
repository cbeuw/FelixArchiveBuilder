Last week, the world’s most
pre-eminent laboratory for the
study of particle physics cele-
brated its 50th birthday. CERN,
often dubbed the ‘Mecca of
physics’ has during the last
five decades been a shining
example of scientific progress
through ‘big science’ and inter-
national collaboration.
In1954,whenCERN(Conseil
Européen pour la Recherche
Nucléaire)wasestablished,the
world was still in shock from
the awesome power unleashed
by the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. Understanding
the inner workings of the atom
became a priority for Europe,
and CERN became a symbol
of post-war scientific collabo-
ration.
It was not until 1984, when
Europe beat the US to the
ground breaking discovery of
the W and Z particles of the
weak interaction, that CERN
gradually became recognised
as the world’s premier particle
physics research facilty.
Europe is currently build-
ing the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN. It’s opening
in 2007 will be another land-
mark in CERN’s history.

Plants’ role in global warming reevaluated
New research suggests that the planet’s ability to adapt to rising carbon dioxide
levels with help from plants may have been overestimated

In the week that the Kyoto
protocol was finally ratified,
more worrying research on
the planet’s ability to adapt
to its rising atmospheric
carbon levels has been pub-
lished.
It seems that the interna-
tional efforts to cap escalat-
ing carbon dioxide emissions
have come about just in time.
Optimistic sceptics of global
warming, who believe that
plants will proportionally
increase their carbon influx
in response to our carbon
efflux, have just been com-
promised. Proposals to alle-
viate climate change by cre-
ating forests, where boosted
growth is stimulated by an
enriched atmosphere, seem
less sure.
Researchers from McGill
University, Montreal have
studied [1] the responses of
several growth lines of the
alga Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii grown under ambi-
ent and elevated CO2 con-
centrations, to high doses
of CO2. The cells’ cultures
were grown for around
1000 generations in liquid
culture in concentrations
that reflect current and
forecasted CO2 levels. The
cells were then tested for
photosynthetic capacity and
limiting density as indica-
tors of growth. But instead
of observing an amplified
growth rate and increased
biomass, no discernable
difference was determined
between the cell lines.
The researchers suggest
that this observation can be
explained by the intercel-
lular physiology of the alga.
If their theory is correct, the
net result of rising atmos-
pheric carbon levels for the
photosynthetic microorgan-
isms will be very little.
Furthermore, the non-
involvement of the ocean’s
phytoplankton is a serious
blow to those hoping that
Kingdom Plantae will take
up our collective carbon
slack. Oceanic phytoplank-
ton are currently predicted
to account for 45% of global
net primary carbon produc-
tion, nearly three times that
of the tropical rainforests
[1]. So it seems unlikely that
any government-sponsored
forest, specially planted to
carbon-sink our way out of
trouble, will manage more
than a finger-prod against
a wall of greenhouse gases,
especially when a sink as
large as an ocean remains
static.
