Imperial’s very own astronaut
What does Imperial College look
like from space? Undoubtedly very
small, but Imperial has one alum-
nus who’s had the chance to see
it for himself. Marc Garneau, who
received his PhD in Electrical En-
gineering from Imperial in 1973, be-
came the first Canadian in space in
October 1984.
Much of Garneau’s life reads like
the diary of an over-achiever. Born
in 1949 to a French-Canadian fam-
ily, Garneau grew up in and around

Quebec City, except for three years
in the early 60s, when his fgiddy-
ather was posted in London. (Gar-
neau attended the Lycée Français
de Londres, just down the street
from Imperial College on Cromwell
Road.) After obtaining his B.Sc. in
EngineeringPhysicsfromtheRoyal
Military College of Kingston (Cana-
da), Garneau immediately began
his doctoral studies at Imperial.
Upon his return to Canada, Gar-
neau joined the Canadian Navy
to fulfill his ambition of sailing the
high seas. He quickly worked his
way through several postings, from
Combat Systems Engineer (1974)
to Project Engineer (1977), Com-
mander (1982), and finally Captain
(1986). During this time, his ac-
complishments dealt mainly with
developing, improving and trouble-
shooting naval weapons systems
and communications.
No doubt Garneau’s impressive
track record, not to mention his su-
perb physical condition, helped him
become one of six chosen from 4000
applicants for the new Canadian
Astronaut Program (CAP).
Garneau was then picked to be
Canada’s first astronaut in March
1984. Nine months later – the
shortest training of any astronaut
in NASA’s history at that time, he
found himself staring down the
Earth from the Challenger Shuttle.
Acting as Payload Specialist for the
eight-day mission, he thus became
the first Canadian in space, and a
national hero.
Speaking to the media from
space, Garneau looked both giddy
and awed: “When you look out at
your own planet and see absolutely
out-of-this-world incredible views
of entire subcontinents, you begin
to appreciate what the world is re-
ally like.”
Bitten by the space travel bug,
Garneau gave up his naval career
in 1989 to devote himself to the
Canadian space program, and un-
dertake further pilot and astronaut
training.
As a result, Garneau was chosen
by NASA to fly twice more out of
the Earth’s atmosphere, as Mis-
sion Specialist on the Endeavour
Shuttle in May 1996 and December
2000. His role in these missions in-
volved conducting experiments, as
well as helping assemble the Inter-
national Space Station. In his free
time, he loved to float while listen-
ing to Beethoven or Bach on his
Walkman.
Back on Earth after his last mis-
sion, Garneau became director of
the Canadian Space Agency (CSA),
but left his post in 2005 to run for
office in the federal elections. Al-
though he lost the election, he re-
mains an active member of the
Liberal Party of Canada. Garneau
is also currently Chancellor of Car-
leton University, sits on the board of
several charities and participates in
federal working groups dealing with
energy, health and air pollution.
He often speaks publicly of the 19
days he spent in space, of the spir-
itual awe he experienced, as well as
his horror in seeing the impact of
human activity on the planet. From
the shuttle windows, Garneau saw
the fires burning through the Ama-
zonian forest, beige clouds of air
pollution hanging over California
and the Mediterranean basin, and
Lake Chad shrinking while deser-
tification spreads over the African
subcontinent.
Marc Garneau now lives in Mon-
treal, Canada, where is often seen
walking his dog. From his home,
Garneau recently told Felix about
his experience at Imperial College.
