Nukes: deterrent or legacy?
Parliament will vote this March on
whether or not to renew the UK’s
submarine based nuclear weapons
system – Trident. A paper submit-
ted by Tony Blair proposes that the
system, originally commissioned
by former prime minister Marga-
ret Thatcher in 1980, should be re-
placed at a cost of around £50 bil-
lion. To remain as one of the world’s
nuclear powers, Britain would have
to replace these weapons before
2019 when they will otherwise start
to deteriorate.
Blair’s proposal, which initially
called for the replacement of all
192 nuclear missiles has now been
modified and suggests replacing
160 of them and possibly reducing
the number of submarines em-
ployed in the system from four to
three. Blair has emphasised “un-
certainties” for the future of the
country, he has admitted that it is
unlikely that a country such as Iran
or North Korea would attempt to at-
tack Britain but said that this is not
impossible.
The government have been criti-
cised for possibly breaching article
VI of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty which calls for members to
disarm when possible. However
Jack Straw has stated that “only a
simpleton” would see Trident as vi-
olating the treaty. It is also a hugely
expensive project, it will protect 500
jobs at Rolls Royce including those
of the scientists and engineers in-
volved but could also drain money
away from public services such as
the NHS.
During the cold war, nuclear
weapons were employed by the
world’s wealthiest nations on the
basis that if two countries possess
them neither will attack the other
out of fear. They have only ever
been used once- in an attack by the
US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Today’s nuclear weapons are about
eight times more powerful than
those used in Japan and each of the
Trident missiles could potentially
kill a million people.
Wars in the twentieth century
are carried out ostensibly to deal
with a minority of dangerous peo-
ple; to stop terrorist organisations
or to remove a dictator. Before the
war in Iraq we were promised that
weapons technology would be used
to limit civilian deaths and that it
would all be over very quickly. It’s
impossible to use nuclear weapons
Democrat dream ticket may just come true
There is no reason for you to have
heard of a former community or-
ganiser and civil rights lawyer
elected two years ago to the United
States Senate after an uncontrover-
sial career in the Illinois State Leg-
islature. But last Saturday, in the
frosts of Illinois, invoking the legacy
of Lincoln and promising to trans-
form American politics, Barack
Obama launched his campaign for
the White House. Already, some are
calling him the first black President
of the United States.
It’s not hyperbole either: the 45
year old is running second only to
Hillary Clinton in opinion polls and
his ability to reach across partisan
divides gives him a wide support
base. He’s clearly rattling some
cages as well: despite the unwritten
rule not to interfere in the domestic
politics of another nation, Austral-
ian Prime Minister and fierce Bush
ally John Howard attacked Obama
on Monday over his views on Iraq.
America was introduced to
Obama little over two years ago
when he delivered a stirring and
enthusiastically received speech at
the 2004 Democratic National Con-
vention. The media coverage which
followed his condemnation of artifi-
cial divides in American politics and
his appeal to the “audacity of hope”
turned him into an instant celebrity.
With Bush’s re-election and a gen-
erally poor showing by Democrats
without causing civilian deaths.
They are often, therefore dismissed
as inappropriate if the ideals of
modern warfare are to be upheld.
Clearly a lot has changed since
the 1980s. At that time Tony Blair
was younger and more idealis-
tic. He was part of a Labour party
founded on socialist principles,
opposed Thatcher’s Conservative
government and was a proud mem-
ber of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament (CND). In 1982 he
described Trident as “nuclear mad-
ness”, a year later he was elected to
parliament for the first time. Lord
Hattersley, the former deputy lead-
er of the Labour party (who prob-
ably wasn’t in the CND) has said
that there is no need for a nuclear
deterrent now, describing it merely
as a “status symbol”.
The Liberal democrats and sev-
eral others have pointed out that
the decision does seem to be going
to parliament very quickly. They
have argued that there needs to be
a more substantial debate before a
decision is made. Could it be that
a prime minister with a reputation
damaged by anti-war protests, pri-
vatisation and scandal is making a
last ditch effort to be remembered?
The debate on nuclear weapons
has brought together members of
the two main parties in support of
Trident but it has also united mass
movements against it. The CND
will be demonstrating in central
London jointly with the stop the
war coalition on Saturday the 24th
February.
across the country a few weeks
later, Obama’s convincing victory
in the Illinois Senate race stood out
and he was established as the new
face of the American left.
Since that 20 minute speech in
Boston, Oba-mania has reached fe-
ver pitch. You’re just as likely to see
him debating foreign relations on
the news as to see him talking about
his childhood on a chat show. You

can even poke him on Facebook. In
October he published The Audacity
of Hope: 288 pages of lucid prose
outlining his political convictions
and thoughts on “reclaiming the
American dream”. It shot to the top
of the bestseller lists and remained
there in the run up to Christmas
with many finding a copy at the bot-
tom of their stockings.
So, what is it that turned an un-
known politician into a cultural icon
and a credible contender for Com-
mander in Chief? One clue lies in
his ethnic mix: the son of a Kenyan
father and a white Kansas mother
he can effortlessly bridge the black
and white divide which still exists
in some parts of America. Within
his varied life story most people
can find some common narrative;
his everyman image has been mir-
rored and amplified by a willing me-
dia. Or as Obama puts it with char-
acteristic elegance and economy
of language, “people project their
hopes on me”.
Moreover, unlike many of his
Senate colleagues, Obama has yet
to experience a targeted negative
campaign against him. When this
undoubtedly happens, it is sure to
add some wrinkles to that fresh im-
age. There are signs of it already:
in suspicious times having a sur-
name which rhymes with Osama
and with Hussein as a middle name
has made him an easy target for
those on the right. With heavy Is-
lamophobic undercurrents, the six
years he spent at a Muslim school
in Indonesia are also coming under
scrutiny from partisan commenta-
tors. CNN have even noted, as if
there may somehow be something
sinister in this, that his trademark
dress sense, a dark suit with a
white open collar shirt, is similar to
that favoured by Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
There is also another hurdle to
Alex Guite overcome before Obama can be-
come President: securing the Dem-
ocratic nomination. Clinton has a
comfortable lead over him in the
polls and won’t be easy to beat once
her campaign gets into full swing.
Some of have suggested a Clinton-
Obama dream ticket, but whilst
it’s sure to get Democratic hearts
pounding, the electoral maths sad-
ly doesn’t add up. America may be
ready for a woman or a black man
in the White House, but particularly
in the Southern states, it doesn’t
seem to be ready for both at the
same time.
There’s no doubt that the Clinton-
Obama rivalry will make for enter-
taining primaries, but his princi-
pled opposition to the Iraq war does
give him a major advantage over
his rivals. Unlike his Democratic ri-
vals in the current election, or John
Kerry in the last, Obama doesn’t
need to perform political gymnas-
tics; he has no need to reconcile ini-
tial support for the war with belated
condemnation of the Bush adminis-
tration’s failings in Iraq.
The election is still almost two
years away. In that same amount
of time Obama has travelled from
obscurity to the national stage.
Whether or not the next two years
are Obama’s journey to the White
House remains to be seen. But one
thing is for sure, you’ll soon have no
good reason for not having heard of
this former community organiser
and civil rights lawyer.
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer – Senator Barack
Obama with former President Clinton
T
he next American elec-
tion is looking like a
doozy. Democrats have
their hotshots lined up
in rows – not only Clin-
ton and Obama, but John Edwards
(who ran for VP) is now having a
shot at the big seat, and even ol’
faithful Mr Environment Al Gore
could very soon be in the picture.
The Republicans too have their own
celebrities. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
– “America’s Mayor” and national
hero from 9/11 is standing, as well
as Senator John McCain, a part of
America’s political furniture. All
we need now is a scandal here, and
some closet skeletons there, and
we will have a reality show better
than big brother can ever give. Who
could be apathetic about such an
exciting election, right?!
Nuclear power has become far
to useful as a diplomatic and mili-
tary leverage to ever realistically
consider that we will find a world
without them. Therefore, as a col-
lective race we must ensure that
some states do not hold others to
ransom with the technologically
sophisticated yet age-old simplicity
of brute force. Such conditions can
only rise if future rulers allow the
growth and development of other
nations, including nuclear power,
and allow much fairer internation-
al game-play. If not, then the op-
pressed might just totally rebel.
