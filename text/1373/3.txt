CGCU Slave Auction raises £1000
The Union President loses at arm wrestling (to a girl!) and Union officers are auctioned all in aid of charity
Thursday night saw this year’s
CGCU Slave Auction raise almost
£1000 for RAG from the auctioning
of officers alone.
Morethanhalfofthemoneyraised
was for John Collins to audition for
the X-Factor (see front page).
The first to be auctioned was the
fetching MatSoc chair, Elly Jay, who
went for princely sum of £10, to the
dismay of RCS Motor Club, who had
been looking for someone to polish
their fire engine.
Former CGCU President and
long-time Union hack Siddarth
Singh only went for £11; a CGCU
source says this is because “he’s
a little strange and quit difficult to
shut up when you want some peace
and quiet.”
Serial midget and misogynist
James Fok (current CGCU Presi-
dent) was bought by Ms Jay for the
bargain price of £9. She seemed
rather pleased with her new toy.
More significant sums were
raised by Luke Taylor, ex-ACC
Chair and Union bar legend. For
£45 and 50 euros (no, we don’t know
why either) he took on John Col-
lins in a yard-drinking competition.
However, Mr Taylor was seen to be
of greater stature and build than
the ICU President, and hence al-
lowed Mr Collins to drink a pint,
rather than the yard (which is three
pints).
Mr Taylor then proceeded to
make the yard disappear in a mat-
ter of seconds, finishing it while Mr
Collins was only halfway down his
pint.
Other sabbs went for significantly
less than Mr Collins; Dave Parry
bought Jon Matthews (Deputy
President, Finance & Services) for
£60; rumours abound that Mr Parry
may make his slave go out to din-
ner with Shama Rahman (see Fe-
lix passim). Ben “Fluffy” Harris
(Deputy President, Education &
Welfare) raised only £2 after being
bought by the RCSU President, Jad
Marrouche.
Mr Marrouche himself was sold
for a yard competition against
James Fok and the RSM Treas-
urer; surprisingly, Mr Fok beat
them both. Plans were afoot for a
gladiator-style jousting match on
barstools, but both Mr Fok and Mr
Marrouche were far too shaky after
rapid consumption of three pints
for this to be an option.
Mr Collins took on two girls in an
arm-wrestling competition, only to
lose to them both to his great em-
barrassment. To this day, he claims
the young ladies cheated.
The event was marred when the
Guilds managed to abscond with
the RAG mascot in revenge for
RAG’s theft of the Guilds decoy
Spanner mascot.
RAG Chair Stephen Brown is said
to be “f**king furious”.
Sabb elections still
not a farce (yet)

RAG week ended on a high at the
City and Guilds College Union Slave
Auction with Union President John
Collins being bought by a consor-
tium of his fellow sabbaticals, Felix
staff and people still bitter about
him leading us into the NUS for the
tidy sum of £450. The current total
raised for charity over the whole
week is still to be determined but
the RAG Chair has been overheard
saying “£3000 and counting”.
As a slave, Collins is being re-
quested to enter the X-Factor audi-
tions to be held later this year. This
announcement was greeted with
great amusement by patrons of the
Union Bar. However a somewhat
cynical Mr. Collin’s announced that
it would only go ahead “once he
sees the money”. As you can see
from our photos, RAG duly obliged
although Mr Collins insisted that
the coins be weighed first.
Thursday evening also saw the
traditional yard of ale race between
the Presidents of CGCU, RCSU and
the RSM. James Fok, CGCU Presi-
dent was the clear winner although
this was disputed by some specta-
tors due to the large volume of ale
which ended up being spilt on the
floor.
The author of this article was
also on the receiving end of a mis-
chievous bid after 2 Guildsman
purchased him to appear on Page
3 wearing nothing but a kilt and a
RAG t-shirt. Readers are warned
that a large degree of nakedness
will still be involved and may wish
A round-up of RAG week
to avert their gaze when it is pub-
lished later in the term.
Despite the excellent take at
their Slave Auction, the clear win-
ners of the interfaculty fundraising
“competition” was the re-formed
RCSU. Their tours of the Queens
Tower and RAG Lecturers Quiz
proved particularly popular with
students and a sum well over £1000
was raised. The lecturers quiz was
a 3 way contest between a team of
3 chemistry lecturers, 3 physics
lecturers and the RCSU Executive
Committee. Jad Marrouche and
his RCSU all-stars duly triumphed,
narrowly beating the chemistry
staff after a tie-break.
Winners of the London Raid for
the second year in a row was the
“Cast of Casualty” team who raised
£835 in under 6 hours. This was al-
most 4 times the amount raised by
“We Saw the Queen” (they did, re-
ally) with commuters and tourists
clearly being impressed enough
with their outfits to hand over large
sums of cash.

RCSU President Jad Marrouche becomes the target of the Hit Squad
This year’s sabbatical elections look
to become rather interesting, with
no position remaining uncontested.
There are now seven candidates
standing for President, includ-
ing two current sabbatical offic-
ers, compared to last week when
there were only four fully-seconded
candidates.
The position of Felix Editor had
been uncontested until just before
the close of nominations, when two
additional candidates appeared.
There are both experienced and
unexperienced candidates running
for many of the positions, includ-
ing President, showing a greater
interest in the Union by the student
body than in previous years. At the
candidates meeting on Wednesday,
ICU President John Collins made a
point of trying to level the playing
field between ‘hack’ candidates and
relative newcomers.
See next week’s Felix for manifes-
tos of each candidate.
I’ve never seen such a crowded candidates meeting
