Two decades, and still unfinished
From Cactuars to Kupo – Michael Cook tells tales of great adventure as we look back on Final Fantasy
W
hilst I want to say
that old games
journalism stand-
ard, “Everyone
remembers their
first time”, I’m not so sure that’s
true of Final Fantasy. So let me
open with something a bit different.
Everyone – everyone – remembers
their first random battle.
“What the hell is going on? The
screen just smooshed. Yeah, I
was just running around, what’s it
… what’s that. Is that me? That’s
me? But I was just walking around.
Those people weren’t even there.
Is this a one-off?”
For many people, it was a one-
off, because they put Cloud, Squall,
Buttz, or whichever plucky FF hero
down and never went near one of
the bastards ever again. But for the
rest of us, it was the first of many
screen smooshes. And that game
was the first of many fifty-hour
journeys. And who cares if you
think VI is better than VII? Who
cares if you didn’t like the ending
of IX? There’s a certain link be-
tween each and every game, and
each and every FF fan.
It’salwaystherandombattlesthat
divides opinion over Squaresoft’s
historic line of turn-based, story-led
RPG masterpieces. People could
bear the plot, even if they found
some of it contrived. People could
forgive it for not being as hardcore
as the Western RPGs, grounded
in D&D, D20, and Dungeons. But
the one thing you couldn’t make
yourself push through were those
darned monster encounters. You
either loved them, or you left.
When the game series launched
in Japan back in the pre-3D days of
1987, Dragon Quest was the big-hit-
teroftheday,developedbySquare’s
then-rival studio Enix, and Square
themselves were on the brink of
bankruptcy. The “Final” Fantasy,
developed by Hironobu Sakaguchi,
was to be both Square and Sak-
aguchi-san’s final game, earn-
ing itself one of the most ironic
game titles in the process.
Ironic because, as we all know,
Final Fantasy was not to be the end
of Sakaguchi or Squaresoft. From
their first tale of the Warriors of
Light and the Elemental Crystals,
all the way through to today’s more
contemporary fantasy tales, the
strange yet unforgettable style of
each game has made the franchise
a clean success from the get-go.
Why strange? Because the more
you see of Final Fantasy, the bet-
ter you understand the
threads that Sak-
aguchi and his
development
teams wove
through
each and every one of the early
installments. Certainly, the Big-
Bird-esque Chocobo creatures,
the Cid character and so forth, are
all examples of Final Fantasy’s
enduring regulars. But the plots
contain a lot of common themes,
and nurtures a certain way of play-
ing. After twenty years and twelve
main games – ignoring the many
spinoffs – it doesn’t take more than
a couple of Final Fantasies to make
it a very different kind of gaming
experience.
One of the most impressive
things to come out of the series
was the way it penetrated the
American market. As the oc-
casional FF got converted –
with a confusing numbering
system that differed from
the Japanese standard – the
American audience lapped
it up more and more, until
eventually Square made the
leap to a new generation of graph-
ics and scale.
I scorned Final Fantasy VII. I
scorned everything on the Play-
station that wasn’t a platforming
game, so when the flags started
waving for some ridiculously-titled
swords and magic game, I ignored
it. I didn’t need that then – I had
Oddworld.
Final Fantasy VII would repre-
sent a crucial jump for Square, as
they chose to leave Nintendo for
the first time to develop for Sony’s
debut machine. Not only would it
allow them to penetrate the West-
ern market far deeper than previ-
ous conversions ever had, but it
would also give them a base in a
rising star in the console war – a
relationship that would soon have
tables turned on it, as Final Fan-
tasy became one of the few stable
licenses for Sony’s Playstation3.
But I was having none of it, and
in fact it wasn’t until Final Fantasy
VIII, when I’d mellowed out and
discovered Metal Gear Solid and,
well, guns, that Final Fantasy be-
gan to appeal.
VIII was, I like to tell myself, a dif-
ferent beast. Unlike VII’s cartoon-
ish stylings, VIII was a real game
that didn’t talk down to you. It took
the gamer into a strange Harry Pot-
ter-meets-Gundam world, where
teenagers trained to be merce-
naries at obscurely cheery high
schools called Gardens. And yes, I
remember my first random battle.
It scared the crap out of me.
Once over the initial shock, and
the initial few confusing deaths,
the control system began to make
sense. Waiting for each turn,
choosing a move from an ever-fill-
ing list of spells, items and attacks,
trying to pre-empt enemy attacks.
