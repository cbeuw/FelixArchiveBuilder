This year’s ice-climbing tour vis-
ited the Briancon valley in the last
week of January. After a quick flight
to Turin, Italy, the group hired cars
and hopped across the border into
France. Our base for the week
was a rather lovely gite d’étape in
Vallouise, just up the valley from
L
’Argentiere-la-Bessée which hosts
abigice-climbingfestivaleveryyear
in the second week of January. The
lean winter had taken its toll on this
year’s festival, with temperatures
simply too warm for many of the ice
cascades to form. Two weeks later,
when we visited, things weren’t
much better but at least the valleys
had some ice, which was more than
could be said for the other tradition-
al ice-climbing areas in the Alps.
We decided to have a leisurely
first day by visiting the Fournel val-
ley. This valley was close to where
we were staying and the climbs
weren’t far from the road hence we
thought it would be a nice easy day.
However it was not to be. The road
hadn’t been (snow-)ploughed and
our small cars, complete with snow
chains, struggled to make their way
through the deep snow. With a lot of
perseverance and a bit of pushing
we got our vehicles as far up the
road as we could (and further along
the road than any other vehicle in-
cluding a four-by-four) before drifts
forced us to park and walk the rest
of the way. The trek to the climbs
took longer than envisaged as we
hadn’t driven as far along the road
as we’d thought. Once at the end of
the road we headed for the nearest
piece of climbable ice we could see;
Les nains des ravines (IV/4), as time
was pressing on. The ice was thin
and in places covered with snow.
Alex and Neil climbed the first pitch
while the rest of us practised plac-
ing ice screws and setting up belays
using abakalovs. We then set up a
short top rope so those who hadn’t
climbed on water ice before could
practise the technique. A long walk
back to the cars followed which we
reached just before dark.
The next day was spent climb-
ing at Ceillac. Ceillac is normally
a popular place to climb because
the ice falls are close to the road
and many of them are classic multi-
pitch routes. However it was excep-
tionally busy as it was the weekend
and only a couple of ice falls had
formed. Mike and Chris joined the
group of people waiting to climb
Y Gully right branch 250m (II/3+)
while the rest of us decided to hike
up the side of the valley to the not-
so-busy Easy Rider 70m (II/3). The
gully was narrow and the ice thin,
which meant there wasn’t that
much room for different people to
climb at once. Fortunately we were
the first people on the ice so this
wasn’t a problem and we enjoyed
the two pitches of 70° and 80° ice
before abseiling back down. After-
wards the fast climbers went and
followed Mike and Chris up Y Gully
right branch 250m (II/3+) as the
queues had gone. Meanwhile the
rest of us traversed along the valley
to check the condition of the other
cascades.
Our target for Sunday was the
Crevoux valley in an attempt to
avoid the Sunday crowds. It was
a long drive from where we were
staying so we set off early, however
the place wasn’t well signposted
and we ended up going round in cir-
cles looking for the turn-off from the
main road. Our objective was the
Cascade du Razis 70m (II/3+ to 5+)
which was an hour and a half’s walk
from the car park. The wall of ice
looked promising on the approach
but as we got closer we found part
of the right hand side, which was
home to the easiest angled climbs,
had not fully formed and the rest
was taken up by guided groups who
had set up top ropes. Thus we were
left to climb on the hard ice on the
left side of the wall. Mike put in a
good lead to get halfway up the wall
but didn’t fancy the crux. Chris set
up a top rope so we could retrieve
the ice screws and then complete
the climb in relative safety. Mean-
while Alex and Neil climbed a hard
full 50m line in between the top
ropes on the right hand side. Next,
a couple of French climbers let us
use their top rope to have a go on
a sustained pitch of vertical (grade
5) ice. On such steep ice, it wasn’t
long before we were all pretty tired.
We retrieved our equipment and
walked out, reaching the car just as
the sun set below the horizon.
The following day we returned
to Ceillac in the hope that it might
be quieter. There was no such luck.
Over twenty people were waiting
at the bottom of the main climbs.
Matt and I went over and climbed
the first pitch of Sombre Héros
100m (II/5) (the second pitch had
not formed). Meanwhile the others
queued for the left branch of Y Gul-
ly Holiday on ice 250m (II/3+). By
the time we’d finished on Sombre
Héros there was no one waiting at
the bottom of Y Gully so we climbed
all six awesome pitches of the right
branch.
The final two days were spent
back in the Fournel valley. The road
had been cleared so we were able
to drive all the way to the car park
at the end of the road. The first
day we walked for about an hour
along the valley from the car park
where teams climbed on Capitaine
Courageux 200m (III/4+) and Da-
moclés 230m (III/4+). Both routes
were long, sustained and energy
sapping. Time passed quickly as
slow progress was made and the
last group ended up abseiling back
down under a full moon. The abseil
pitches were a little longer than our
50m ropes so a little improvisation
was called for. Once everyone was
down safely from the climbs we all
trudged wearily back through the
snow to the car guided by our head
torches.
On the last day we decided to
climb Grand Bleu 100m (III/4)
which sat high up on the valley
side. Unable to find the path we
trail-bashed our way over a boulder
field covered in knee-deep snow un-
til we found the well trodden path
higher up. We arrived at the foot of
the climb exhausted from the ap-
proach. The first pitch was a full
50m of 75° ice which turned out to
be a bit wet and gooey but this was
nice to climb on compared with the
hard brittle ice we had encountered
further up the valley. The second
pitch was some 45m in length and
inclined at an average 85°. Alex led
the pitch while the rest of us were
happy to second. At the top, the ice
was thin and unstable as it sand-
wiched a layer of snow. A slab of ice
a metre in size sheared off and hur-
tled through the air towards those
tied into the belay some 40m below.
It hit the ice above them and broke
up. Luckily their helmets took the
brunt of the shower and they were
left with nothing more than sore
heads and a few bruises. Unde-
terred everyone made it to the top
before abseiling back down. The 70°
first pitch of the neighbouring cas-
cade called Balade du Piaf (III/3)
looked easy compared to what we
had just climbed. It was tempting
to zoom up it, however our muscles
ached from the cumulative effects
of a weeks worth of ice climbing. So
we called it a day and thus ended
the tour on a high by climbing some
of the hardest ice we’d climbed all
week. We headed back to the gite
d’étape to celebrate what had been
a most enjoyable and memorable
week.
This tour would not have been
possible without the support from
Imperial College Union, the Har-
lington Trust and the IC Trust. Our
sincere thanks goes to them all.
