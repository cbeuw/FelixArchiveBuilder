A response to
the gay adoption
article
Naked people and homosexuality
A Catholic defends against the claim that Christians are homophobic, and a previous centrefold model
takes issue with being called “not conventionally beautiful”
Sir,
In Felix #1,372, an article (“Gay
Adoption – Where’s the Crime?”)
raised some interesting issues. I
would like to address some of the
questions raised in the (apparently
anonymous) article.
The first misconception is that
Christians are homophobic: this
could not be further from the truth.
Even the Catholic church does not
“condemn” gays because of their
sexual inclination. The main prob-
lem is that, after much research,
the Church believes that homo-
sexual relationships tend to be very
unstable. The Catholic adoption
agencies would not place a child in
the care of any couple that is likely
to split up, be it same-sex or other-
wise. They would probably also look
at more important criteria than
whether or not the couple “drink
Stella Artois” and have “only one
Geography GCSE between them”,
but that’s another matter.
The comment that Holy scrip-
ture was written “several hundred
years after” the lives of Jesus and
Mohammed is clearly misguided. I
am not qualified to write about Is-
lam, but in the Christian case, Bible
scholars have dated the synoptic
gospels (Mark, then Matthew and
Luke) to only thirty to forty years
after Jesus’ death, while St. John’s
gospel is thought to have been com-
mitted to paper sixty years later.
The epistles were written even ear-
lier, as was the quella, a text com-
mon to St. Luke’s and St. Matthew’s
gospels. Of all writings from antiq-
uity, dating techniques show that
the New Testament is the most au-
thentic, and closest to the original
(these techniques are quite compli-
cated, and I wouldn’t like to go into
details here).
Finally, dismissing religion as
“fairytales” is rash and somewhat
ill thought out. As a Catholic, I see
plenty of evidence for the existence
of God, or at least the “supernatu-
ral”, if only from a “Dives and La-
zarus” point of view. As a scientist,
I see little to either prove or dis-
prove the existence of God. I would
suggest that religion is at least as
plausible as, say, quantum mechan-
ics or the Higgs mechanism. This
world is a very complex place, and
so much of what we “know” to be
true can come unstitched without
much effort (as anyone who has
done a physics degree can tell you).
The author has clearly made his de-
cision, and that is to be respected,
but he should show respect for oth-
er people’s beliefs in return.
I agree that the church does
seem to be discriminating against
homosexuals, but there is some-
thing deeper in the story that has
emerged over recent weeks. It
is alarming that the government
thinks it can dictate the moral
standards of this country. Do we
really think that the people who
supported the war in Iraq, and who
wish to renew Trident, are right to
make moral decisions for us in our
every day lives? The truth is, I am
worried that this may only be the
start of government interference
in people’s spiritual life and moral
decisions.
I would add that I have nothing
against homosexuals; Jesus calls
for us to love everyone to the best
of our ability, and I have nothing but
respect for gays. I hope that this
letter has been informative, and not
offensive in anyway.
Andy,
I wonder whether you’d like to ex-
plain your meaning behind the
phrase “not ‘conventionally’ beau-
tiful” to me in a little more depth?
My appearance has been described
as everything from handsome to a
bin liner full of custard but never
in what appears to be a euphemis-
tic and thinly veiled jibe -- and cer-
tainly neither Kat nor I have never
as an example of someone who is
unattractive, for any purpose.
If you want my take on page 3 in
general, I think it is a good piece of
fun that shouldn’t be taken too se-
riously either way – either to mock
the porn industry or to replicate it.
Women as it happens are no more
“sexualised” (if that is an adverb!)
than men, viz. Brad Pitt, George
Clooney, Jude Law etc. It is my
Andy Sykes replies,
The only real issue that the article
raised was that adoption cases
should be considered on an indi-
vidual basis, whether they come
from hetero- or homosexual cou-
ples; sadly, you have failed to grasp
or address that point in your reply,
instead reacting against the man-
ner in which the author expressed
his views.
Indeed, the likelihood of a couple
splitting up ought to be the cru-
cial factor in deciding whether to
place a child in that couple’s care.
However, you deny the eligibily of
same-sex couples by alleging that
their relationships ‘tend to be very
unstable’ without adducing any
relevant evidence. Even if there
were such evidence, as a scien-
tist, you should know better that to
conclude from it that all same-sex
relationships are therefore unsta-
ble. So why should adoption cases
not be considered on individual
merit, especially if the Church
has nothing against gays, as you
maintain?
The closing couple of paragraphs
of your letter seem to offer a point-
er. Your worry about the govern-
ment’s dictating moral stardards
would appear to imply that you
consider adoption by homosexual
couple immoral. This belies your
repeated denial of homophobic
sentiments within the Christian
community (which at any rate is
extremely hard to take seriously)
and shows how you actually feel
about such couples.
Having ‘nothing against’ and ‘not
condemning’ publicly are, alas, not
the same as respecting and treat-
ing with due justice.
Also, I very much doubt that Je-
sus qualified his teachings with
phrases such as ‘to the best of one’s
ability’.
What do you
mean, not
‘conventionally
beautiful’?
Andy Sykes replies,
All I meant, sir, is that you are not
the classic Adonis – you know the
type. You are not 6’ 4”, tanned, and
incredibly muscular. It was not
meant to imply your looks were,
as you say, akin to a binliner full
of custard.
I agree with your points about
page 3, especially about the ‘pur-
pose’ of porn. I do remember read-
ing an article in a friend’s psychol-
ogy magazine that proclaimed
that mordern internet pornogra-
phy was creating a generation of
young people who had a morbid
fear of pubic hair.
belief that both men and women
should be aware of what each other
look like before entering into a rela-
tionship with one, let alone get mar-
ried, and in this role the porn indus-
try has a bearing though clearly
a good deal of what is available is
unlikely to be justifiable under that
criterion alone.
I look forward to your response.
