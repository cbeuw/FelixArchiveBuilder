So there we were, the corridor of
rock ending just ahead. The usual
pool of muddy water lay in front of
the sheer wall. Strangely a rope
led from a bolt on the left, down
through the mirrored surface and
into the depths. We were on the far-
side of Sump I in Swildon’s Hole. To
go back now the way we had come
was impossible – other sumps that
we had emptied with buckets and
siphons would have refilled by now
with the slow percolation of water
from the surface. Our only way
out was to dive through this short
flooded section before climbing the
150 metres (nearly twice the height
of the Queen’s Tower) back to the
surface.
“It’s simple!” I explain to the first-
timers, “Lie down in the water to
get used to the cold and flood your
wetsuit, take a deep breath and
then pull yourself hand-over-hand
on the guide line. Keep low so you
don’t float up and get stuck on the
ceiling, someone will grab you when
you reach the other side. Send three
tugs on the line when you’re clear.”
And so the number of lights slowly
dwindled, each one uttering a “See
you on the other side” before setting
off. A few anxious seconds, then the
tugs coming back on the line and
the next caver getting ready.
Finally I was alone. The tugs
came. I lay down in the water, and
felt the icy fingers slip in through
the seals around my neck. Alone,
and a long way from a place of safe-
ty. Please lights don’t go out, please
Caving club take the plunge
rope don’t fray, please helmet don’t
get stuck. A deep breath and I force
myself under.
Bubbles as I sink, the water stings
my face. No point looking about
– too cloudy to see anything. I pull
myself along and graze the pebbly
bottom. Too low. Hand over hand
on the rope. Hit the rock ceiling.
Too high. Am I there yet? There’s
no way to tell what’s going on above
– had better continue rather than
risk snagging my helmet.
Suddenly I’m grabbed under the
armpits and wrenched out of the
water. I gasp, pick myself up and
stumble out-of-kilter from the pool.
Just a few seconds; but the cold
is sapping. Everyone OK and ac-
counted for, now there’s just a quick
climb between us and our dinner.
Spelunking can get a trifle wet. Spooky too – icy fingers slip around necks before reaching the other side
Fancy a 3-course meal Thai cuisine
whilst enjoying the light and sound
of traditional and modern Thai
dances, as if you were in the mid-
dle of town in Thailand? Thai soci-
ety proudly presents to you ‘Thai
Night’.
Thai Night is one of the biggest
and most spectacular event we hold
every year here in Imperial College
with the supports from various
sponsors; Thai Airways, the Thai
embassy and famous Thai res-
taurants around London e.g. Thai
Square and Thai Pot.
This year we’ve arranged our
events into an ‘À-la-carte’ style
where you will be sitting down with
your friends or loved ones enjoying
the show whilst your food is served
up directly to your table.
You won’t be disappointed by the
3 course-meal comprising starter,
main course and dessert which,
including well-known dishes such
as Satay and Pad-Thai, will seem
as if it is served straight from Kow-
Sarn road in Bangkok. Not to worry
if you’re vegetarian, as we have a
special menu prepared for you.
The show itself is composed of
various cultural dances to reflect
the four different parts of Thailand;
North, South, East and West. ‘Muay
Thai’ or Thai boxing is also one of
the main attractions of the show.
The purposes of this event are to
promote Thailand’s unique culture,
to help foreigners to understand
Thailand’s long historical culture
and to raise funding for Open World,
a charity project in Thailand.
The event will take place on Sun-
day 25th February 2007 at 6.00pm in
the Main Dining Hall (MDH). The
tickets, a bargain at £10 each, can
be purchased outside the MDH or
JCR already.
To reserve tickets, please send an
email to phuchong.suriwong@

the yard too much… although they
did join us later (alas sans ducks).
Severely underestimating the dis-
tance left since there was not much
more ascent or descent, we set off
along the dismantled railway line
again. The line snaked through the
roof of the moors and we came very
close at one point to a heather fire,
which the rangers create and con-
trol to help out the grouse which
like heather at different heights.
The smoke from these fires un-
dulated up into the darkening sky
(it’s all physics) and through them
the sun shone red. The setting sun
tinted vast swathes of heather pur-
ple and soon the heat we had begun
to get used to started to dissipate
as the sun finally vanished behind
the hills. Being passed by cyclists
was normal; what wasn’t normal
was when a pair stopped beside us
and said they had a message from
Tim! We were to go to the pub in-
stead and meet him there! (Now we
see why Tim is the president of the
society). Nathaniel repeatedly told
us over the next two hours that the
pub really wasn’t that far and that
(although it wasn’t on the map)
we’d be there soon. Soon enough,
a building far in the distance came
into view. ‘That can’t be it, that’s
way too far’ – Nathaniel. (It was).
The Lion Inn, which we reached
in the dark, was definitely worth
it. It must be one of the most re-
mote pubs in England, high on the
moors, and yet it was still packed
full. Slanting stone walls and open
fires completed the experience as
we finally got a drink in a building
built by monks in 1553. We later re-
turned to the pub after a brilliant
supper eaten in the comfort of our
own freezing barn with a heater that
decided to belch smoke for an hour
and deliver very little heat. The pub
though was warm and we stayed
until 11:20pm playing gin rummy
and taking photos of Evelyne, Nath-
aniel and Katherin asleep. I slept
much better that night, probably
because we walked 18 miles, but
also as I was thankful to be alive af-
ter Richard bombed it down a 20%
slope (after stalling ).
Sunday was as warm as Saturday
and we had decided the night be-
fore to do a coastal walk from Robin
Hood’s Bay to Scarborough. The
drive through the countryside was
beautiful as the sun shone through
the windows and the surrounding
trees were still coated with frost.
It was like going back in time. We
passed Whitby, Dracula’s landing
place, and soon arrived at Robin
Hood’s Bay, a small town on the
side of a slope down to the sea. I
had heard that it used to be a smug-
gling haven and there is a story that
the houses are so close and jumbled
that a ball of string can be threaded
through all the houses merely by
passing it through the windows.
Richard was still poorly so stayed
with the minibus, which became
a taxi. The rest of us set off along
the cliffs that tumbled down far to
the sea below. The sides of the cliffs
varied from steep grassy banks to
small woods to sheer stone drops
and soon we came upon ‘Beast
cliff’ which wasn’t really a beast.
The route dipped down and then
back up again several times before
the flat sand of the beach where
we took a stroll, wandering up to
the flat sea. After kicking aside
strange piles of chalk (which we
later found out was being used to
mark out a race route) we stopped
for lunch in a field on the side of a
rise in the cliff height, which meant
we could see for many miles ahead.
We still had no idea how far it was
to Scarborough; Richard (there
were two!) had some nasty blis-
ters and we wanted to get back to
London before Monday. Therefore
we decided to divert Richard (driv-
ing the minibus) to meet us earlier
along the route. Blistered Richard
battled bravely on as we descended
into the beautiful National Trust
nature reserve of Hayburn Wyke,
where a storybook-setting water-
fall flowed out to the sea. The way
back up to the cliffs proved to be the
last major ascent of the day and it
wasn’t long, still in the heat of the
day, before we found the minibus
(at around 4pm) to begin the 7-hour
drive back to London. The sunset
that evening was magnificent as we
drove through Yorkshire to the 80’s
tunes from Yorkshire Coast Radio.
We had a hugely extended journey
due to many diversions and traffic
jams on motorways, and of course
the stop for a pub supper – which
was completely devoured – gold
stars all round. Finally arriving
back in London we were all sad
to say goodbye to the yellow mys-
tery machine that had became our
friend; well done everyone, another
great weekend.
The Fellwanderers organise week-
end trips such as this every fort-
night; day walks in and around
London are also fortnightly. See
