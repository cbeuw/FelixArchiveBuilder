“Garneau was then picked to be
Canada’s first astronaut in March
1984. Nine months later – the
shortest training of any astronaut
in NASA’s history at that time, he
found himself staring down the
Earth from the Challenger Shuttle.”

Creaking Doors
“Narcissus Road is really a mixed
bag of an album, it fluctuates be-
tween quite interesting to intensely
tedious but throughout the weak-
ness of lyrics and repeating mu-
sical themes detract from good
potential.”

“For those of you who are unaware
of the masterpieces created by
Wes Anderson, I will now proceed
to give you my very biased, slightly
tribute-esque analysis of this tal-

“You will never find yourself wish-
ing the game will hurry up so that
you can get started on the next and
this is a soul saver for those of us
who like to finish our games with-
out the pang of post-purchase-not-
polished-off-guilt.”

“A slab of ice a metre in size
sheared off and hurtled through
the air towards those tied into the
belay some 40m below. It hit the
ice above them and broke up.”

Union core complete
The Union finally has use of the
central core, after more than six
months of building work. The build-
ing project has suffered numerous
setbacks and delays; during the
summer break, asbestos was dis-
covered in the core, and a lack of
plans for the building (due to its
age) which lead to workmen cutting
water pipes, causing flooding.
The lift, the centrepiece of the
core redevelopment, is to be deliv-
ered by March.
The core is now mostly complete,
with contractors applying a few fin-
ishing touches to the building. A mi-
nor drama erupted last week when
the sabbs discovered the new doors
ordered for the entrance to Union
Reception and the Union Dining
Hall were about an inch too large
and would not close properly. The
doors have since been replaced.
The opening of the core completes
the first phase of the Beit redevel-
opment. The next phase involves
the splitting of the Union Gym into
two levels; the upper level will be-
come the Student Activities Centre,
and the lower level of the gym will
be enlarged.
The shiny new entrance and fur-
niture in the bar seem to have had
no effect on the penchant of drink-
ers to vandalise the toilets in the
building. After the Superbowl event
last week, the men’s toilets behind
the Union bar suffered damage, and
further punishment had caused the
cubicles to fall over completely.
The toilets had not been repaired,
and on Thursday morning after
Sports Night in the Union, the toi-
lets had been almost completely
destroyed. Cubicles were ripped
up, fittings were damaged, and the
floor was covered with urine, beer,
food and vomit.
It is not clear whether those re-
sponsible for the vandalism are Im-
perial students, or from elsewhere.
Main entrance to the Union re-opens after more than six months
of work – but vandalism continues in the building
“Naughty vending
machines” shock
Emily Lines
Editor-in-toilet
New vending machines have ar-
rived in the Union, and have caused
a bit of a stir with the normally con-
servative College population.
The machines are made by
NaughtyVend, and feature items
such as vibrating cock rings (there’s
a phrase I never thought I’d see
in a news article – Ed.), flashing
nipples, handcuffs and inflatable
sheep.
In the interests of research, Felix
purchased a number of these items,
but was unable to claim them on
expenses as the machine refused
to provide the author with a VAT
receipt.
The sheep seems to be anatomi-
cally correct in almost all respects,
including an orifice to the rear for
purposes unknown.
Surprisingly, no complaints have
been received by the Union yet,
though the machines have only
been in place for a week. Eyebrows
were raised in the Beit offices at
the “Blowdom” cannabis condom.
The machines are in both the ladies
and mens facilities; according to
the NaughtyVend website, the male
products outsell the female ones al-
most four-to-one.
The disproportionate ratio of the
sexes at the College is unlikely to
buck this trend.
