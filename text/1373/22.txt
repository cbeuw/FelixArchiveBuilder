The weird world of Wes Anderson
Chelsea Manning talks orgasms and tributes one of Hollywoodâ€™s most talented and underrated directors
I find it a damn shame that more
people are not aware of the fabu-
lous director/producer/film writer
Wes Anderson. I first fell in love
Wes Andersonâ€™s films when I saw
the movie Rushmore starring Ja-
son Schwartzman. The surreal
atmosphere and outlandish plot
just blew my mind. I thought, â€˜No
way can a director follow up such a
primo production.â€™ Then I saw The
Royal Tenenbaums... I cried tears
of joy, but they might have just been
tears of not blinking for two straight
hours. Either way, the protein in
those tears was held together with
bonds of pure amazement. After
The Royal Tenenbaums I thought,
â€˜No way can Wes pull off such bril-
liant and colorful characters again.â€™
I practically had an orgasm in my
seat when I saw The Life Aquatic
With Steve Zissou.
For those of you who are unaware
of the masterpieces created by Wes
Anderson, I will now proceed to
give you my very biased, slightly
tribute-esque analysis of this tal-
ented manâ€™s films. You should prob-
ably read my description with the
skepticism of someone listening
to a mother speak about the su-
preme talent of her bratty blob of
procreation.
Wes Anderson has a core group of
cast that he uses in most of his films,
consisting of Bill Murray, Owen and
Luke Wilson, Anjelica Huston, and
Gene Hackman, all wonderful ac-
tors whose combined talent can be
articulated by the expression âˆžâˆž.
The usual Anderson protagonist
is very clever, yet plagued by de-
pression and awkward quirks and
character flaws. His characters are
chock full of dry humor and elitism.
I find The Life Aquatic With Steve
Zissou Wes Andersonâ€™s most daring
and impressive piece to date. Itâ€™s
filmed in the style of a documentary
following the Zissou Society, a sail-
ing crew that, whilst clad in match-
ing baby blue track suits, produces
documentaries about their voyages
and experiences with aquatic wild-
life. Steve Zissou makes it a mis-
sion to find the Leopard Shark (an
animal fabricated by Anderson
that is essentially a big ass shark
with leopard patterned skin) that
killed his best friend. In a way, the
movie is basically a massive hom-
age to Jacque-Yves Cousteau, right
down to the ridiculous knitted red
beanies.
Wes Anderson films simply have
elements Iâ€™ve never seen in any oth-
er film â€“ he captures an absolutely
novel style on screen. His movies
are filled with vibrant, almost car-
toon-like colors that are painted all
over the costumes and scenery. The
refreshingly quiet dialogue is punc-
tuated by loud, fuck off Devo, Iggy
and the Stooges, and David Bowie
songs. The films are such a change
from the current shit films that
capitalize on loud, flashy stunts,
and special effects. And Iâ€™m sure a
lot of Imperial students could relate
to the exceedingly intelligent, but
socially inept and dorky characters.
Just kidding. Kind of.
Wes Andersonâ€™s most recent cinematic slice of oddness, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, starring Bill Murray amongst many legends
