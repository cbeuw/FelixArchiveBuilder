Alex says: “Creating subheads for this page is the pinnacle of pointlessness. Just say: ‘here’s more puzzles.’”

Sudoku mania! Kakuro – round 6
The numbers indicate the sum of the dig-
its in the row or column indicated. For
example, the square with 7 and 11 in it
means “the numbers you write in the row
below must add up to 7, and the numbers
in the row across must add up to 11”. You
may use each number only once within a
row of cells (called a ‘run’), like sudoku.
Any spare cells are available for the de-
piction of romantic dinners for two in a
silhouette style.
