Sarah Connolly as the schemeing Agrippina
Handel’s Agrippina tells a familiar
tale of corruption and deceit in the
upper echelons of Roman society.
When the emperor Claudius appar-
ently drowns at sea, his ambitious
and well-connected widow Agrip-
pina schemes and manoeuvres her
son Neronene, born from a previ-
ous marriage, into position to claim
power. But when it is revealed that
Claudius has been saved and is re-
turning to Rome, the title charac-
ter’s best laid plans and ambitions
are revealed for all to see and her
resolve put to the test.
In David McVicar’s production,
originally debuting in Brussels,
the tale is adapted to contempo-
rary Britannia. It works well – the
games of power are now played out
between corrupt politicians and of-
ficials in tailored suits, corporate
vampires, and pseudo-WAGs vying
for their spot at the trough of indig-
nity and fame.
The snapshot works well and in-
fluences from modern Britain are
evident in the Enfieldesque brat
Nerone and the beautiful Poppea, a
crucial cornerstone in Agrippina’s
plans, who veers between Bridget
Jones and a Boujis debutante.
It all makes it readily accessible
to the novice, and though the show
weighs in at just under four hours,
it never becomes tiresome, throw-
ing up laughs, entertaining and ab-

sorbing in equal measure.
The vocal performances are, on
the whole, dazzling. Though the
show has been criticised as being
a vehicle for the feted Sarah Con-
nolly as the show’s main character,
there is admirable depth across
the board. Connolly’s Agrippina is
charismatic and wilful, and techni-
cally faultless.
As her son Nerone, Christine Rice
steals the show with a spine-tingling
vocal performance matched by her
similarly show-stealing cocaine-
fuelled antics. But the real find was
ENO main stage first-timer Lucy
Crowe as the pawn-turned-player
Poppea – the audience’s concentra-
tion was palpable every time she
graced the stage with her unre-
strained vocal power.
And not least, Daniel Reuss
controlled the music admirably
from the pit; Handel’s electrifying
score was both mesmerising and
elevating.
The script was sparkling and
bright. Though crassly comical, it
retained the essence and spirit of
the original while receiving a wel-
come infusion of profanity more in
line with the rest of the production.
It wasn’t subtle – but it was fun and
the show flowed easily between its
various scenes and arias.
By striking the right balance be-
tween retaining traditional operatic
integrity and embracing modernity,
McVicar opens his arms to both au-
diences. Opera has never been so
accessible.

ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA AND CLIVE BARDA
Hannibal Lecter’s ‘Memory Palace’
is the starting point for Thomas
Harris’s new novel Hannibal Ris-
ing. If you’ve read any of the other
books or seen the films, you’ll be fa-
miliar with this concept, but here it
is tired. Harris uses it to introduce
you to Hannibal the genius with a
museum-like mind. Unfortunately,
this hackneyed beginning doesn’t
fade away; it only gets worse.
We first find little Lecter living in
a castle in Lithuania with his sister,
noble parents, and tutor to see to
his genius. It is the early 1930’s and
great flapping metaphors about
black swans of doom and his inno-
cent sister abound. The Nazis are
coming, and the Russians, and in
the increasingly short chapters we
are constantly reminded that they
are, surprisingly, the bad guys.
The events of WWII carry the
Lecters away from their castle and
into hiding in the woods, there’s lots
of suffering caused by the baddies
(Nazis), and a rather hurried con-
clusion where all of Lecter’s family
are killed – his sister in a gruesome
case of cannibalism: this is the part
where you feel sorry for Lecter.
As fate would have it, the war
ends and our little orphan Lecter is
looked after in a Russian commu-
nist orphanage which, ironically, is
situated in the castle that belongs
to him. Luckily noble painter Un-
cle Lecter comes to his rescue and
sweeps him away to his chateau in
France and to meet his mysterious
Japanese aunt.
This introduction to Hannibal’s
teenage years is where I really be-
gan to dread reading more of the
book. Auntie Murasaki is the sum of
every Japanese cliche; icily beauti-
ful, a whiz at haikus, and owner of
terribly sharp swords. Yawn. Some
revenge ensues when the uncle
falls ill and Hannibal has to avenge
his Aunt’s honour. Things get a little
out of hand with the revenge, and
Hannibal becomes known to your
standard lone maverick policeman,
Inspector Popil. Yawn again. So,
him and Aunt move to Paris, where
Hannibal (he’s a genius again) is
training as a doctor.
The quiet life is not suited to Han-
nibal, however, as he’s suddenly ob-
sessed by elaborate revenge on the
men who destroyed his childhood.
From here, it’s all downhill. There’s
none of the suspense of the earlier
books and none of the interplay be-
tween Hannibal and his victims. We
can’t sympathise with the crudely
drawn victims because they’re evil
ex-Nazis and we can’t sympathise
with Hannibal any more because
he’s so cartoon-creepy.
If you’re coming to Hannibal Ris-
ing having never seen any of the
films or read the other books in the
Hannibal Lecter series, then you
might possibly enjoy some of the
drama, but even for pure trashy
novel enjoyment, there’s not a
lot to recommend. It’s fairly obvi-
ous that Hannibal Lecter is now
purely a cash cow for the author.
Perhaps the film version suits the
dumbing down of such a magnifi-
cent murderer more aptly, but I’d
recommend giving both a miss and
watching The Silence of the Lambs
instead for a taste of what Hannibal
the cannibal is really about.

Review
If Imperial made Arts Festivals ...
There’s been something in the air
this week. It smells sweeter, sounds
more melodic, and everything looks
that little bit brighter. Yes, it’s that
time of year again: ArtsFest week.
For all the first-years amongst
you, this is the week that Imperial’s
extensive collection of A&E (Arts
and Ents) clubs showcase their tal-
ents and prove to us all that being
a scientist and having artistic/mu-
sical talent are not mutually exclu-
sive personality traits.
ArtsFest has been more promi-
nent on campus this year than any
other this reporter can recall; you
can hardly have failed to hear the
busking in SAF, Tanaka, and Sher-
field, featuring some of Imperial’s
choral and instrumental elite.
Art has been well-covered too,
with PhotoSoc and LeoSoc exhibi-
tions in the Blyth Gallery (that’s
Sherfield Level 5), plus a retrospec-
tive of Imperial’s artistic past in the
MechEng Foyer.
It’s not all been about showing off
talent. Workshops on Wednesday al-
lowed students wanting to try their
hands at drama, art, and dance.
But if you have missed seeing
some of what’s been on offer, don’t
despair (well, as long as you’re
reading this on Friday!) The Finale
Concert is at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the
Great Hall, promising all the best
from the week, including dancing,
musical performances, and mar-
tial-arts demonstrations.
