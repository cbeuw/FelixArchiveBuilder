I, Gamer
R
ole-playing is a
strange word when
it comes to classi-
fying games. Since
the average gamer
spends their hours in the guises
of World War 2 sergeants, alien-
fighting nuclear scientists, and
Tiger Woods, it’s fair to say that
all gamers do is roleplay. But
so-called Roleplaying Games
have set themselves apart as
a genre over the years, now
condensed into one main idea
– character improvement.
Over the years, however, it’s
also been about getting to know
your character, and putting a
little something in the game.
This week we look at the East-
ern tradition of fantasy slash-
em-ups with a retrospective
glance to the Zelda and Final
Fantasy series, in preparation
for Final Fantasy XII’s launch.
Japanese RPGs – Japanese
gaming in general – often has
the stereotype of being long, in-
volving, and essentially simple.
It’s certainly a recipe that’s
done Squaresoft well over the
years. But that’s not to say that
Western RPGs are any shal-
lower, or more challenging. The
Elder Scrolls series, as well as
the Baldur’s Gate franchise on
PC as well as console, might
represent a culturally differ-
ent kind of roleplaying, but the
core elements remain the same
– big story, small idea.
RPG remains – and may al-
ways remain – one of the geek-
ier corners of gaming. And giv-
en that gaming itself is a little
nook of life filled with cobwebs,
geeks, and copies of Freespace
2, that’s quite an achievement.
But as the numbers slowly shift
to behind the scenes, and the
story becomes something the
player’s involved in as much as
the designer is, there may be a
change in that.
If you’re looking to pick up a
copy of Final Fantasy XII fresh
on launch day, HMV at Oxford
Circus have organised a spe-
cial launch event at lunchtime
on Friday 23rd to celebrate
the launch of the game. Given
the look of Final Fantasy XIII
(check out our feature on the
series), it could be the last time
you play it like the good old
days.
Felix Games is still looking
for extra contributors – please

for the section. It doesn’t mat-
ter whether you play games all
night, or haven’t ever picked up
a controller in your life – all we
want is interested writers!

This week in videogaming
Who’s winning in the console war
currently? Is it the XBox 360, with
their strong marketing presence
and good relationship with EA? Is it
the Playstation3, who are welcom-
ing better and better news in Blu-
Ray sales? Is it the Wii, still selling
out the world over and getting more
attention from publishers? The an-
swer’s not what you might expect
– it’s none of them.
With the XBox now firmly in its
grave, obituary written in the an-
nals of gaming history, the last-gen
might seem to be somewhat over.
But sales of Playstation2s are still
on the up, bolstering Sony’s user-
base, and the Nintendo DS Lite - re-
leased almost a year ago in Japan -
is still sold out in its home country.
Playstation2 owners are looking
forward to God of War 2 and Final
Fantasy XII, and huge sales of DS
Lites means more conversion and
development for the novel handheld
console – with prices significantly
lower, even than a Wii, it’s not just
the latest technology that’s making
the big sales. With the Playstation3
still struggling – a key developer at
EA recently advised people to steer
away from Sony’s latest console
– it’s possible that the Playstation2
may stay in production for some
time.
In the land of the PC, things are
far rosier. Vista users are slowly
calming down as they discover
which games work – though at the
time of Felix going to press, Sec-
ond Life, an internet-phenomenon
MMO with more than a million ac-
tive users and a trade of around $1.2
million per day, completely refuses
to work under the new operating
system.
But single-player gaming is smil-
ing, and so was Will Wright as he
gave an address at the DICE sum-
mit on the challenges around de-
veloping his latest creation, Spore.
Wright performed his usual trick
of being unimaginably intellectual,
and discussed how the structure of
intricate games like Spore have to
be broken down to communicate
with the player in as simple a way
as possible. The game, which has
high hopes set on it by a lot of gam-
Spore blossoms, EVE falls, and the old days prevail. And teh Console Warz, I guess
Gears Of War nabbed eight awards at DICE’s AIAS ceremony, including Best Game and Console Shooter
ers, is due to be released within a
few months.
AstheBurningCrusadeisreduced
to the smouldering news headlines
that WoW players are used to, the
big news in MMOs this week came
from EVE Online, the space sim on
a huge scale. When EVE hits the
gaming news, it’s either because
the developers are making an an-
nouncement, or because someone’s
been betrayed. This time? Both.
“I’m here so this whole issue --
which jeopardized my company and
our community -- can be put behind
us” were the words used to open a
confession by EVE developer “CCP
t20”, who admitted to illicitly sup-
plying highly powerful blueprints
– information that can be used to
manufacture powerful weaponry,
ships, and equipment – to some of
the largest Corporations in the EVE
universe.
Unlike Second Life, EVE’s play-
ers don’t make much money from
their investment. But EVE saps
time unlike any other MMO, and be-
trayal in such an involved universe
– in particular, from the people that
nurtured the community in the first
place – was hard to swallow for a lot
of the dedicated players.
