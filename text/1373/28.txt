Greetings, intrepid wordsmiths.
In my voyages across hill and
dale this week, I came across a
young girl. I handed her a tissue
afterwards.
Bad semen jokes aside, I see
very few of you have been entering
the crossword. This disappoints
me greatly. Do you know how
hard it is to draw those miniscule
recepticles to the left of your meaty
paw? Hours, I tell you; hours.
If there’s something wrong with
the crosswords, then you must
inform us post-haste.
This week’s crossword has no
theme; just keep in mind that
I hate you. It won’t help, but it
makes me feel better.

Send your answers to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk or bring this page
down to the Felix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad by Tuesday 9am.
Each week, we’ll choose a winner and give them £10 in real, honest, paper
money. That’s at least half a pint in South Kensington pub terms. Last
week’s winner was me, because no-one entered. Fools! It wasn’t even
that difficult.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
Chebs. Gash. Fruity-
loop. Three of my
favourite words. Mum.
Myra Hindley. Harold
Shipman. Three of
my favourite people.
Ducks. Silverfish. Colonic crabs.
Three of my favourite animals.
Send your favourite diseases in a
SAE to the usual address.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
So, I recently bought a
digital camera. It said
on the box 10 mega-
dixel zoom and super
colour definition.
Anyway, I decided to
stick it up my Dad’s jap’s eye. You
wouldn’t believe what I found! The
colours were so vibrant and your
mum’s pubes are ginger, not black.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
I don’t feel like dancin’,
dancin’, dancin’... Rick-
arickaricka rawwoo.
Don’t feel like dancin’,
dancin’ yabba dabble
de do. Oh look: Russell
Brand. There’s one man of homo
sapien descent that I would like to
verbally batter with my vocabulary
before annihilating.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, I got love in
my tummy and I feel
like spitting it all over
you. Yeah, that kind of
love. You know it, the
kind of pelvic thrusting, head bob-
bing, one-eyed trouser snake tonsil
tickling loving. Mmm... salty and
slimey. Finger licking good.
This Week’s Slippery Slopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
This week you’re play-
ing around with the
SCART connector on
the back of your TV.
Startled by your sister,
you smash your head
through the back of the TV. 6 days
after being declared a missing per-
son, your wife switches to the AV
channel and you get electricked.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Big fish, little fish,
cardboard box. Big
fish little fish, card-
board box. Just a few
of the delicacies avail-
able on the menu in
the Felix dungeon tonight. Deserts
include mahjong pieces, ivory wal-
rus tusks, and sweat sodden Andy
Sykes graduation shirts.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Fish is a kind of meat!
Fish is a kind of meat!
Cheese is a kind of
meat, a tasty yellow
beef. Cheese is a tasty
kind of yellow beef.
That’s a point. You know those
bubbles in fizzy spring water? Cow
farts. Cola = pig farts. OH NOES.
No drink for you veggies. Die.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Matthew Smith: I’m
intrigued to know
what you think of
Phil Collins. After the
tragic collapse of Gen-
esis, did you follow his
solo career or seek pastures new?
Myself? I felt his third album was
a bit of a let down, but I’m hardly a
knowledgable expert on said topic.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
I just love cock. Com-
ing at me from all
angles, one here, one
there. Dodging the
sperm spears is just
one of the many pleas-
ures involved in such dangerous
games. Sucking toxic cock is how-
ever, deeply against my religion
and I urge you to refrain too.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
I was once trapped in
a vulcan death grip.
The pain was bear-
able but only because
of the sheer magni-
tude of my pythons.
Reversing the hold was a piece of,
excuse the cliché, meat loaf, and
soon thereafter one was submitted
to my own vice like grip. You daiiii.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
What’s your favourite
letter of the alphabet?
Personally, mine is the
letter after ‘Z’. This
strange and wonder-
ful character is often
used to describe the whiff of a
freshly felched anus, straight after
rectal biresingent has taken place.
Just so you know.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
This week you choke
on a parma violet
sweet whilst reliving
those hazy days back
in year 4, when you’d
scoff an entire packet
of the purple pills. Oh, how times
have changed. Sweet eating skills
aside, you’re also much less sup-
ple. Life sucks, I know.
