Some releases and stuff
Enthusiasm running low at Felix music as all music appears to suck nowadays
Keeping up with the continual
onslaught of new bands is an im-
mense task, not only due to the
sheer volume but because so many
of them are tripe, generic, bland
and/or shit. The Hours is a band on
the precipice.
While they do maintain a similar
quality throughout their debut, as
presented on the album's first sin-
gle, Ali in the Jungle, the move to
a long player highlights the limita-
tions of the group.
It is quite easy to think of The
Hours as a group, but in fact it is a
creative duo consisting of Antony
Genn and Martin Slattery. Although
The Hours may be new, these two
have been around the block a few
times. Genn has toured with Pulp
and produced UNKLE while Slat-
Matty Hoban
needs Dinosaur Jr

Bear together and we can do each
other’s hair. By the way, my cock
is bigger than yours.
I quite like a lot of obscure mu-
sic, this does not mean I hate
‘chart’ music, you will frequently
find me singing the lyrics to vari-
ous Girls Aloud and recent Nelly
Furtado singles. That Take That
single, Patience did not deserve
the Brit Award for best single, it
is an awful song. That made me
angry.
By the way, there is a poster
for a gig on the 24th February in
the union, it will be outstandingly
great. So you should come, or stay
at home playing online games, it’s
your life really.
The Hours
Narcissus Road
(Polydor)
★★★✩✩
album review tery toured with Black Grape (a
Shaun Ryder group) and worked
alongside Joe Strummer. With this
much experience I would expect a
little more imagination than that
seen on Love You More. Starting
with a mix of Coldplay piano and
Interpol guitar, Genn sings such
gems as 'I love you more than my
Adidas trainers, I love you more
than Tony Soprano, and if you
knew me better that's a fuck of a
lot' – I just pray they got paid for
product placement.
Admittedly that song does de-
velop some interest but like most of
the album, tonky piano sees almost
Keane like over use. Thankfully it
isn't a white wash and tracks such
as Back When You Were Good fall
nicely into the quality, easy listen-
ing niche.
Towards the end of the album
things start to look better, I Need
To Know injects a subtle dose of
punk into the handclap type sounds
which seems to be every song. The
anthemic People Say which moves
away from the general sound of
the album showes heavy influence
from late 90s indie groups before
the album wraps up with Let Me
Breathe, a mush of romantic sing-
ing, swelling guitars and strings in
the back ground – nothing to write
home about.
Narcissus Road is really a mixed
The Hoosiers
Worst Case Scenario
(Unknown)
HH✩✩✩
single review
The Hoosiers have a fucking ridicu-
lous name and for that alone they
deserve no attention at all – quite
why a London band has named
themselves after the native Ameri-
can name for Indiana, that or a
dodgy American movie about small
town basket-ball is beyond me. The
band itself sound like the hideous
love child of Ima Robot and Lilly Al-
len. Worst Case Scenario, a catchy
debut and if you are into happy-go-
lucky indie-pop, then you will love
this. Unfortunately past the shouty,
gleeful lyrics there is no originality
Mumm-Ra
What Would Steve Do?
(Sony)
HHH✩✩
Tipped for the top, Mumm-Ra are a
bundle of fun all the way from Bex-
hill. What Would Steve Do? is a fran-
tic mix of honest vocals and rhythm
guitars. Unlike a lot of new bands,
Mumm-Ra knows their bounds and
stay away from anything too pre-
tentious, without faux American ac-
cents et al. Mumm-Ra clearly have
taken props from the likes of the
Libertines, replacing all the twa-
tish smack addictions with retro
pop-rock love which for some rea-
son remind me of Love (although
not the same calibre). All this is a
good thing as Mumm-Ra are on the
bill for the NME Awards Indie Rock
tour, a guarantee that you will here
plenty more of this band for a good
6 months to come.

single review
and by the time the 2 minutes 55
draws to a close it is hard to remem-
ber anything from the song. Radio 1
fodder this is but better examples
lie around every corner.
Nick Simpson
bag of an album, it fluctuates be-
tween quite interesting to intensely
tedious but throughout the weak-
ness of lyrics and repeating musical
themes detract from good poten-
tial. As much as I would like to fall
in love with this album and forget
its faults they are just too common
and too obvious, hopefully the next
album from The Hours will move
into new ground.
