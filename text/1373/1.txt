ICU President John Collins has
agreed to audition for The X-Factor
series.
At the CGCU slave auction on
Tuesday, Mr Collins was sold for
£450, with money pledged by sab-
baticals, other Union officers, and
Felix. The aim of the bid was to co-
Andy Sykes
Editor-in-chief
erce Mr Collins to audition for the
new series of the X-Factor while
dressed in a pink tutu. The song
selected for him was My Humps by
The Black-eyed Peas.
Mr Collins appeared sceptical
that the money pledged would ever
materialise. However, RAG Chair
Stephen Brown presented £450 in
pound coins and notes to Mr Col-
lins on Thursday, who insisted on
weighing the money to be sure it
was the correct amount. In fact, Mr
Brown had raised £485.
Mr Collins has asked to be accom-
panied by the CGCU Barbershop
Quartet, and Mr Brown has agreed
to this concession.The auditions
are in March.
The money raised by the auction-
ing of Mr Collins will be given to
charity by RAG.
College’s “Space Executive” have reversed their earlier decision
to deny the RCSU use of the old print shop on the Walkway for
their office. Jad Marrouche, RCSU President, had this to say
to Felix: “I’d particularly like to thank John Collins, Alex Guite,
and our friends at the Faculty of Natural Sciences for helping
us achieve this latest milestone, but most importantly thank
you to all those students who signed our petition and joined our
protest.”
