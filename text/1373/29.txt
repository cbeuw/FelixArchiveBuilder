February butterflies
It was strange being the only first-
year on this weekend’s trip, but as
it was explained to me when I men-
tioned this, everyone else probably
needs to get out more. And what a
place to get out to! It will no doubt
surprise everyone that during the
two days and nights of our trip
to the North York Moors I didn’t
see a single cloud except for tiny
wisps far away. The sheer beauty
of a landscape so barren and yet
so diverse with its rolling moors
and frosty valleys, emerging out of
winter but still baring all to a cold
clear sky was breathtaking. This is
surely the farthest from London an
English landscape is likely to get.
As usual the health-and-safety-
defying minibus which I shall call
‘the yellow one’ (I can see you nod-
ding now), sped away from London
to a relatively clear motorway with
the characteristic ‘Marcus wants
cock – Imperial College London
– how’s my driving?’ written on
the back. At our dinner stop at a
chippie on the way north we soon
realised how cold it was going to
be, as the temperature plummeted
upon stepping outside. And yes the
chippie had battered Mars bars
– that’s when you know you’re in
the north. After one more stop to
pick up Andy from Doncaster sta-
tion and a journey filled with the
either stupidly quiet or unbear-
ably loud radio, we arrived, amidst
the moors, at a surprisingly early
11:45pm. The moon was full and
the sky completely clear with the
stars showing in their hundreds;
sometimes in London I forget they
exist. As the camping barn was just
as cold as outside (they really did
mean it when they said ‘barn’) we
did what should be the only govern-
ment test of ‘Britishness’: we made
tea – and it was warm. We admired
the cooker and the working fridge
and settled into our sleeping bags
at around 1am, after Nathaniel
made his special double bed so he
wouldn’t fall out and Evelyne went
to bed sporting the entire Blacks
winter catalogue, wearing about 15
layers of brightly coloured clothes.
I couldn’t help feeling jealous when
Tim commented that his sleeping
bag was ‘toasty warm’, whilst mine
showed me the other end of the
spectrum.
After a bizarre night – deranged
cockerels determined to wake us
up every hour and Nathaniel talk-
ing in his sleep – we woke at 7am to
the sunrise, which was so perfect
in the clear frosty morning that
Tim exclaimed ‘oh my God!’ and
ran outside. At that moment I seri-
ously thought someone had stolen
the mini-bus or run it over with a
tractor, but alas no. At 8:30am we
left the barn and walked across the
valley bottom, still white with frost,
and climbed up to the level of the
moors, a few hundred metres up.
Grass and small trees soon be-
came heather and gorse and the
view stretched away on all sides
into the distance. We followed a
straight track for almost half an
hour through the near silence of a
landscape more suited to the moon
before reaching the Cleveland
Way, a long-distance walking route
through Yorkshire. Bearing slightly
west we followed the Way along the
straight path of an old railway line,
constantly being startled by grouse
bursting out of the undergrowth,
yapping like small dogs. It wasn’t
long before someone found rem-
nants of snow, tucked into the dips
on either side of the path where the
sun hadn’t shone. The snow (which
was really more like ice) was a bit
too hard to throw but we were con-
tent with shoving it down each oth-
er’s necks. Before long we came to
the highest point in that part of the
moors, the stomach-turning 454m
high Round Hill, so called as it is
the site of a neolithic burial and has
a characteristic mound. It is proba-
bly this feature alone that makes it
the highest point but luckily for us
the top was graced by a trig point,
making it relatively easy to find.
Our route then took us off the
moors down to a road and then
back up the other side to a section
of moorland standing alone, gouged
by glaciers on each side. Its elevat-
ed position at the northernmost
edge of the moors gave us a view
over the flat fields below all the way
to Middlesborough and beyond un-
til obscured by the mid-day haze.
One of the glacier-gouged edges
of this section of moor forms a
well used climbing and scrambling
destination, the Wain Stones. We
stopped for lunch perched on the
stones at the top of the drop. It was
so warm we could have sunbathed
... in February. Later in the day we
saw several butterflies which prob-
ably shouldn’t be there until May.
After lunch we began our route
back which first descended into
the valley mostly occupied by small
woods, fields of kale and pheasants.
Navigating in the valley proved
harder than up on the featureless
moor (I have no idea why) and it
took several attempts to finally find
our way to the path back up to the
moors again. Walking among the
small woods provided welcome
shade and I even felt compelled
to soak my shirt in water before
putting it back on (yes it really was
that hot). On the way up again the
group split as Richard was poorly;
Tim, Andy and Richard headed
back on a quicker route to the barn
and the rest of us took the route
over the moors a different way. I
guess Tim just missed the ducks in

take enough beer on the trip
