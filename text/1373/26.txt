COMPETITION | Win a copy of Final Fantasy XII and other FF goodies!
Final Fantasy XII’s release is just days away, and thanks to SquareEnix we’ve got a copy of Final Fantasy XII to give away as well as a set of figurines from the game! To be in with
a chance of winning, just answer the following question, entries in an email with the subject line, “Would You Like To See My Ultimate Weapon?”, along with your name, to games.
felix@imperial.ac.uk by February 23rd, or on a slip of paper with contact details handed into the Felix office (downstairs in the Media Wing of Beit Quad). The winner will be notified
soon after the competition closes. It’s a simple question, just tell us:
What is the name of the cute, overfed, exploited, misunderstood and fairly edible-looking yellow chickens that turn up in the Final Fantasy series?
a) Moogles b) Chocobos
c) Shuffle to the left, shuffle to the right, Scoodlee-ah-ta, scoodlee-ah-ta. Birdie tweet tweet, birdie tweet tweet (tweet tweet).
If you ever try and rationalise the
idea of standing around waiting
for your go to kill something, then
Final Fantasy’s turn-based system
immediately becomes something
very ridiculous. But it didn’t need
to make sense. Frankly, caterpil-
lars the size of houses and scant-
ily-clad ice queens that leapt out
of your head “didn’t make sense”.
It did what it felt like, and you felt
good for trusting it.
And the fun was in the scale, any-
how. Take a look at Cloud’s impres-
sive weapon (above, not on those
questionable websites we fre-
quented last week) and you’ll begin
to wonder just how strong these
SOLDIER types have to be in or-
der to carry around what looks like
a dragon’s toothpick. Look at his
arms, for goodness sake! They’re
little spindly sticks!
Not to mention flying ships the
size of cities, flying cities the size of
… cities … exploding planets, fight-
ing black holes – Final Fantasy was
– is – about a strange kind of im-
mersion that comes when you let go
of, “Why can’t I …” and “Shouldn’t
they …” and begin to accept the
fantasy that they’re offering. You
took control of frogs, and dressed
up as strange, cat-like creatures
called moogles. No-one questioned
it, it just seemed like the sensible
thing to do at the time.
When the eleventh was an-
nounced as a massively mutliplay-
er online game, there was some
concern over where the series was
headed. It’s hard to tell whether
Final Fantasy XI’s relative failure
up against the likes of World of
Warcraft and EVE Online was what
spurred SquareEnix to return to
single-player form, or whether the
merger between Square and Enix
back in 2003 spurred them back
into their story-led roots.
Either way, Final
Fantasy
XII is now to be released in the UK
on Playstation2, with XIII already
announced for the Playstation3 as
well as a series of spinoffs for mo-
bile and an action-oriented game
for the PS3 along the lines of Final
Fantasy X-2.
There’s no denying that the se-
ries has evolved a lot. Originally
closed to the idea of revisiting old-
er games, Square produced a film
extension to Final Fantasy VII – ti-
tled “Advent Children” – along with
several animés and game spinoffs
telling various pre- and post-game
stories. A semi-sequel to Final
Fantasy X also followed, as well as
promises of the same for Final Fan-
tasy XII.
There’s always resistance when
changes like this occur. The only
two game series to have sold more
than Final Fantasy are Pokémon
– a franchise that doesn’t want to
change – and Mario – a franchise
that doesn’t need to change. Having
the third-largest fanbase in gaming
isn’t an easy thing to handle, espe-
cially when the demands of newer
fans are at odds to those that still
play the NES and SNES games in
their original glory.
Anyone who’s loved a Final Fan-
tasy game – and even those that
hated them – got something out of
Square’s much-revered series. But
change has to happen, and even
without plot continuity, a series as
long-running as this has to change.
Final Fantasy XII’s battle system,
using a semi-automated adapta-
tion to their turn-based sys-
tem, called “Gambit”, is
a huge change when
the better, rather than a water-
ing down of the same old winning
formula.
Screenshots of XIII show the
game to be visually stunning, but
also considerably different to past
incarnations – battles appear to
have no turn-based ele-
ment at all, and even
though the videos are
undeniably concep-
tual, it certainly
shows that
Square have
lost neither
inventiveness
nor desire to
innovate. A
new con-
sole always
means
new di- rec-
tions, and that
inevita- bly
means more con-
troversy. But for many gamers,
they’re willing to stay the course,
just as Square has done, for anoth-
er twenty years more.
Final Fantasy games are still
remarkably hard to find on some
platforms, still being reinvented
and rereleased through em-
ulators and independent
developers, and still
a firm part of
pop culture
– some- thing
that is unlike-
ly to change,
welded as they
are into the history
of videogaming.
The old days of Final Fan-
tasy may be coming to a close,
but the next generation seems to
be a fresh enough experience to
warrant keeping up with. Whatever
the outcome, there’s no sense of
finality yet at SquareEnix, and the
future suggests there’ll be plenty
more random battling to come.
com-
pared to the
stringent ATB,
wait-your-turn styles of
SNES versions and earlier.
But it looks set to be a change for
How times change: Final Fantasy VII’s Cloud Strife, shown on the previous page, in his Advent Children incarnation. Amazingly, Final Fantasy XIII looks similar to this in-game
