T
he world of Hyrule has
always been a very
strange place indeed.
Not just because of the
trolls, skeletons, Zora,
and larger than life Hulk Hogan
look-alike Gorons but because
everyone repeatedly manages to
get amnesia. How many times has
Zelda fluttered her eyes at Link?
How many times has Hyrule Cas-
tle undergone an architectural
makeover? And how many times
has Ganondorf been skewered by
Link’s Master Sword? Matron! Yet,
although gamers are entirely
familiar with this world
they’re eagerly prepared
to plough into getting
the same
girl once
again.

Successful Twilight emergence
As the sun goes down on Nintendo’s latest Link adventure, Tom Roberts asks if it was worth it
Zant and it’s up to our young hero
to save the kingdom once again.
This time he has the help of a crea-
ture called Midna, best described
as Hey Arnold’s long lost cousin.
She has the power to transform
Link into a wolf as and when neces-
sary. Midna and Zant suit the world
comfortably, whilst bringing ele-
ments of darkness to the glowing
fairy tale land. Zant is a suitably
fearful replacement for Ganondorf
and Midna’s introduction is surpris-
ingly startling whilst she toys with
Link. It’s indicative of the love-dis-
trust relationship that you hold
with the little imp, something
which niggles at the back of
your mind throughout the
game.
Her power to transform you
into a wolf is perhaps the
bravest creative decision
in such a huge series
since having to play as
Raiden in Metal Gear
Solid 2. For large
chunks of the game,
you’re tasked with
sniffing scents and
digging to gain access
to certain areas. The
choice brings welcome
variation, but the con-
trols are certainly less
intuitive as the wolf.
At the very least,
the Wii remote is as
good as a Game-

A button can send you plummeting
over the edge of a cliff.
The dungeon format remains
faithful, complete with small keys,
daddy keys, and exceptionally well
designed layouts and puzzles. The
temples are intricately designed,
lulling you into a sense of awe at
the potential complexity awaiting
your discovery when they are in
fact generally linear experiences.
Obtain small key, progress to find
the next. The genius arises when
you arrive back at the entrance
room, better equipped and having
pushed the necessary blocks into
place so that you can finally reach
that mysterious hole in the ceiling.
The sense of achievement and ev-
erything falling into place is deeply
gratifying and you’re rewarded
with a trademark boss encounter;
an experience you enjoy rather
than dread. The sand temple’s boss
is especially fun.
One minor oft cited criticism is
the save mechanism in the dun-
geons whereby you have to return
to the entrance after turning off the
console. Personally, my compulsive
nature meant that I completed dun-
geons in one sitting and when this
didn’t happen, Nintendo had the
sense to never take the adventure
far away from the entrance room.
As with all of the Zelda games,
Twilight Princess is a fine example
of OCD sufferer’s worst nightmare.
There are numerous caves to un-
cover, almost a hundred bugs and
poes to collect, not to mention the
fishing side game, or simulator as
is perhaps more appropriate with
the Wii remote. Having clocked up
around 55 epic hours after finish-
ing the game, I am actually consid-
ering returning to it, a testament to
the game’s success and something
which Grand Theft Auto has never
managed to do. There are easily
another 10 to 20 hours of exploring
and the initial fifty or so are some of
the most addictive I’ve ever played.
You will never find yourself wishing
the game will hurry up so that you
can get started on the next and this
is a soul saver for those of us who
like to finish our games without
the pang of post-purchase-not-pol-
ished-off-guilt.
Twilight Princess feels special
from the very first moment that you
hop onto Epona and gallop around
the Ordon ranch. Soon after hop-
ping the gate to Hyrule’s fields of
freedom, Twilight Princess steps
up a gear when Link has to pursue
a band of thieving orcs and goblins.
You’re tasked with rescuing a kid-
napped girl whilst on horseback.
The A button whips Epona into a
gallop and quickly you’re closing in

them flying backwards whilst their
oversized boars plough into
turf. Twilight Prin-
cess gives speed
and aggression to
epic Lord Of The
Rings style fights.

faces and lashing tentacle dread-
locks drop out of the sky at regu-
lar intervals to halt your progress.
There are similarly haunting dark
wyverns and it’s clear that some-
body at Nintendo has been watch-
ing The Matrix, though thankfully
the makers have done the art jus-
tice here.
Twilight Princess is not entirely
without its gripes however. When
will a game perfect swimming un-
derwater? Why does Link insist on
climbing side ways round that vine
ridden wall, rather than hauling
himself on the ledge? These are
minor faults;
a pimple
on the
Goron
King’s rotund
rear end, of
course.
More importantly
is whether the game
has overhauled it-
self enough for its lat-
est outing. The additional
characters are well imple-
mented, the new weapons
and items are a pleasure
to use and frequently more
fun than any of the recurring ones,
and the story is pleasingly more
bizarre than before. Twilight Prin-
cess has not undergone a dramatic
sea change though; we’re not even
in the Wind Waker territory of dar-
ingness. What’s clear is that the
compulsion to keep playing, the
magnificent gameplay and sheer
quality of design is unmatched by
previous offerings. This is the best
Zelda game created.
That is one hell of a statement and
can only warrant one outcome.
You buying it.
