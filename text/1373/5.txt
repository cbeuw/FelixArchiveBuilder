Digging up the Royal School of Mines’ past
“One of the biggest things about
the Royal School of Mines is the
tradition,” says Seb Turner, current
president of the RSM. It isn’t hard
to believe this as we sit in the im-
pressive foyer of the Royal School
of Mines building on Prince Con-
sort Road. The RSM has existed, in
one form or other, for well over 150
years. And that gives its members a
different perspective on Imperial’s
centenary year.
The Royal School of Mines be-
gan life in 1851 as the Government
School of Mines and Science Ap-
plied to the Arts, and it gathered
its first teaching staff from the Geo-
logical Survey and the Museum of
Economic Geology. It underwent a
number of name changes in its first
decade, but eventually became the
RSM in 1863. In these early days,
the school was located on Jermyn
Street, south of Piccadilly. It was
not until 1872 that the school moved
west to South Kensington, taking
up residence in the Huxley Build-
ing on Exhibition Road. That build-
ing is now the Henry Cole wing of
the Victoria and Albert Museum;
the RSM moved to its current loca-
tion in 1913.
Of course, by that time the RSM
was no longer an independent
school. “In 1907 we merged into
the Imperial College name as one
of the founding schools,” Seb ex-
plains. The merger would benefit
both: “The reputation of Imperial
and the Royal School of Mines,
they’re both as impressive as each
other,” he continues. So, I suggest,
just like Norwich Union, ‘together
we’re stronger’? “In some ways,
yeah!” he laughs.
In 2001 Imperial moved to a facul-
ty structure, with the RSM joining
City & Guilds in the newly formed
Faculty of Engineering. In a student
referendum, engineering students
opted for the name “City & Guilds”
for their student union, with the 100-
year-old RSM Union ceasing to ex-
Colin Barras
ist in 2001. “I think one of the main
reasons for that was it was just too
small. Compared to City & Guilds
or the Medicine Union. There were
the three big Unions and us, the
smaller one,” explains Seb. But the
RSM fought back and, in 2002, it
was recognised as a Clubs and So-
cieties Committee within the wider
Union. The RSM name was pre-
served. “We’re well over 100 years
old as a Union, and the department
is over 150 years old. So it would
have been a shame to lose it,” says
Seb. “But the other thing is, I think
the students in this department are
slightly different to the students at
the rest of Imperial. I think they are
slightly more outgoing.”
Imperial students had reason
to thank those outgoing RSM stu-
dents in 2005; when the Southside
Bar was closed, the RSM was at the
heart of the campaign for a replace-
ment. “That campaign was led by
the RSM and the Real Ale society,”
Seb tells me. “Tobias Dalton, who
founded the Real Ale Society, was
the forerunner. It was only because
of those moves that Harrington’s
was ever built. It was never in the
plans to be there.”
The RSM may be small, but it is
very active. Evidence for that can
be seen in the wide range of soci-
eties and events within the RSM.
Chief among the events is the Bot-
tle Match, played every year against
Camborne School of Mines, part of
the University of Exeter. The first
match took place in 1902, which
makes it one of the oldest varsity
matches in the world, second only
to the Oxford and Cambridge boat
race. The teams compete for a 3-
foot-tall beer bottle that fell off the
back of a lorry and into the pos-
session of RSM students in 1946.
This year’s match, the 105th Bot-
tle, begins on Friday 23rd February.
“We’re putting it under the title of
‘Centenary Bottle Match’,” says
Seb, “although the 100 year Bottle
Match was actually five years ago.”
We can but hope that Imperial’s
100th anniversary will inspire the
RSM to retain the bottle for an elev-
enth straight year.
So, how else does the 150 year-
old RSM plan to mark Imperial’s
centenary? “We have plans to do a
few events,” Seb says. He picks up
a leaflet that is lying on the table in
front of us. It’s an advert for a sym-
posium that is being organised by
RSM’s De La Beche Society later in
February. “This is going under the
title ‘Centenary Symposium’, on
Frontier Geology. And we’re hav-
ing a talk by one of the retired lec-
turers, Professor Dick Selley. He’s
been doing a lot of research into the
history of the RSM and the depart-
ments over the last 100 years, which
will be the main centenary event.
That’ll happen later this term or in
the summer.”
The RSM may have had some
hard times in recent years, but it
seems to be a vibrant organisation
today. Seb agrees: “Maybe 300 or
400 of the students go to an RSM
event at some point in the year.
That’s nearly 50% of our members.”
I’m suitably impressed. “The RSM
is a good reason to get together.
People love being a part of it. They
wear the regalia with pride.” With
pride? “Yeah! We’ve got all sorts of
things. Hoodies, t-shirts, ties, which
sell really well.” And I can think of
no more appropriate blend of the
old and new within the RSM than a
Hoodie bearing the RSM logo.
Why did you choose to complete
your PhD at Imperial?
In my mind, Imperial College was
the best Engineering College in
England.
So I felt lucky to have the oppor-
tunity to do my postgraduate work
in the Communications section of
the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment. I even had the brilliant Colin
Cherry as my supervisor. He was an
eccentric genius whom I admired
greatly, and who was a wonderful
mentor.
Whatdoyouremembermostabout
your three years at Imperial?
I had a fantastic time at Imperial.
I was a poor student like everyone
else and lived in 4 different bedsits,
all within walking distance of the
College. I became an expert, again
like everyone else, at finding events
that were giving out free food!
Life was simple: I was poor but
healthy, and nothing distracted me
from my work. I was able to focus
totally on my research.
With all this research going on, did
you find any time to participate in
groups or sports?
I played on the College water-polo
team, as well as on the University of
London team. We actually won the
British University championships
in 1971! I also swam for the College,
and was a major user of the squash
courts.
Do you believe there is something
specific from those years that
helped you become the first Cana-
dian in space?
I think the fact that Imperial Col-
lege has such a solid international
reputation helped a lot. Also, hav-
ing lived abroad, I was viewed as
having a broader experience in in-
ternational issues.
You grew up mainly in Canada.
Was there something from home
that you missed while you were
abroad?
Once in a while, I needed to get out
of London into the wide open spac-
es. I’d escape and go on hikes in the
Lake District, Scotland or Wales.
Perhaps that’s the Canadian in me!
So, while you probably can’t see Im-
perial College from space, there is
apparently no limit to how far a de-
gree from Imperial can take you.
