IC Ladies 2 vs Royal London rKp.0
Our best game so far, bin noi oui
greatest performance - a number
of scrambled goals as opposed to
well worked manouvers. Goals
for Angie, Sarah and Ann.
Thanks to Emily for her guest
appearance in goal.
IC Ladies 2nd vs LSE 0
Another good win, having
dominated the game throughout.
Thanks to our guest footballers -
Emily "Kanchelskis" and
Marianne "Cantona". More goals
for Ann, one for Juliet and two
lor Annaly. A storming game and
a very encouraging performance.
ICMen 3rd vs R S M M e n l s t 0
An aggressive start saw IC gain
controlled possession. Before
long, a storming solo run down
the left wing saw IC smash in the
first goal. Not content with only
one, IC popped in a second in the
closing stages of the first half.
After what must have been an
inspiring pep talk, RSM came
back strongly in the second half
and pulled one back, putting
pressure on IC. However, this
didn't deter IC who went on to
score two further goals before the
close of play.
Scorers were S. Davies (2), R.
Brunt and S. Baron.

IC Ladies vs St Anselms
After years of losing, we finally
beat Stavos and her crew from
the darkest depths of Stanmore.
The match turned out to be a
9-7 thriller with a star
performance from Carolyn, the
taxi driver, who won all of her
games. Also a mention to Dani
who managed to smack her
partner in the mouth with a
badminton raquet (but at least
we won the point!!).
As always, we are short of
women players, so if you fancy a
game please leave a message on
the Badminton board (No. 1) and
we'll contact you.

C Virgins vs RSM m

n
Sunday 20th November
Due to sheer fear of the Ladies'
skill, only eight of the RSM men
turned up. With 21 Ladies raring
to go, the match was played
anyway, this time with no
concessions (not allowing the
men to run, etc.) unlike previous
years. The first try was scored by
the Ladies, with a cracking run
by Nicky. The second by Cathy.
RSM got into gear and scored
once before half time. After half
time, they then equalised and
then Billy (sorry Lynsey,
almost!) put us in the the lead
again. Sadly, RSM robbed us of
our victory in the last minutes,
with the final score being 15-15.
Good fun was had by all, well
done to all the Ladies, you all
played brilliantly, a shame about
the lack of a coach, eh, Will?
Watch out for a revenge match
next year!!

IC in Regional Competition
The IC Fencing squad went to
Queen Mary's, in distant and
dangerous Mile's End, in search
of glory! We certainly found it in
our impressive defeat of King's
College, who unfortunately (for
them that is) were well over their
heads! The foil and sabre lads
easily conquered this puny
opposition with 9-0 and 7-2
triumphs respectively! Things
became a little more dicey in our
match against UCL, but we
endured magnificently! The
sabre boys kicked some serious
ass (9-0) to break the tie with a
resounding clash of arms! Easy
victories by the foil lads and
some memorable comebacks by
the epeeists, plus a little nudge by

Nick (as a saber-eur), brought us j
yet another victim in the form of |
Royal Holloway!
Our run of successes was
sadly foiled by the Q M W squad
who fielded a number ol Bnti
Squad foil/epee internationals.
The foil and epee guys put up a
tough and glorious fight in the
face of this staggering array of
might (special mention to Alex
who gave it his all in some
admirable fencing, and Jell who
was up ahead for a short while),
though lamentably in the end, in
vain.
Nevertheless, we finally (after
a gruelling six hours) completed*
the competition in second, and
we are looking forward eagerly to
our next encounter in the
elimination rounds. We are sure
to put the Fear of God into our
opponents after this performance!

IC maintained their succession
of wins remaining unbeaten in
the London league. Although it
was dry our court was still very
slippery.
We made a slow start with
some inaccurate pas; ing and lots
of dropped balls, but soon
remembered how to play. By the
reasonable lead. A big team
