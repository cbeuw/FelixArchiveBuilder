Teacher Sifu Andrew Sofos.
"The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a
matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account
be neglected."
Sun Tzu 500 BC
"Don't neglect this marvellous opportunity for you to
learn a practical and highly treasured martial art. Surely
you life is worth more than £2.50 per lesson."
Sifu A. Sofos 1994 AD

A decade of History at IC
Over the past 10 years we have done more
than just teach self defence and martial arts.
We pride ourselves in using our extraordinary
y^jjbJW skills to help the less fortunate people in life.
"J Through our charity work performed here in
the Union Gym we have had, the Lord Mayor
of London, the Mayor of Westminster and the Mayor of
Haringay attend and witness breathtaking feats and
raising thousands of pounds for charity. Celebrities and
VIP's have also walked the grounds of IC. Such to the
extent that master Sifu Sofos was awarded "progress
with humanity" by the Mayor of Haringay.
We have encouraged the growth of Scholarly work
with our endless efforts to get students more aware,
confident, and set a realistic approach in tackling their
exams. We have also helped students through way of
counselling how to deal with emotional upheaval and
depression.
We have instructed "women self defence courses" free
to students of IC, which again is in the pipeline. Look
out for further details. Why not join a winning team,
with a reputation of great spirit. We will endeavour to
find you the road to spiritual enlightenment through
the motions of Sofos Wing Chun. Kung Fu.
