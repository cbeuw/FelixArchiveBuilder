Fiona Duerden

As the Union we recognise the
fact that harrassment does occur
at IC, and are prepared to work
against this. My role is to ensure
that your complaints, fears and
ideas are taken seriously. The
way you feel matters. As people
in any minority group need
specific representation in college

The Health Centre
The Health Centre provides 24
hour care for NHS registered

Imperial College are not
registered with the Health
Centre, they can still use its
facilities during the day, but
should call their own GP for
home visits and out of hours
requests.
The doctors and nurses
give general medical and
occupational health care. Help is
available for matter such as
stress, study difficulties,
pregnancy counselling and health
promotion. The doctors and
nurses can help with
psychological problems and a
consultant psychiatrist also
attends weekly.

to visit you at South Kensington,
Paddington, Clayponds or

Loretto is also interested in
feedback from students and staff
regarding the environment in
which we operate. The College is
active in its efforts to improve
access and facilities for our

information and observations
you can pass on will be
invaluable in this work.
