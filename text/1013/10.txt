INSPIRATION
WHSU • Last Saturday, 350 women brought their sleeping bags to the ^Science
r^jp-,. I Museum and took part in Europe's first ever womens science night. They spent
I the evening engaged in workshops extracting DNA from onions and inves-
tigating electromagnetism, as well as discovering one woman's experience
of bringing meteorites back from Antarctica in a freezer. But why does the Museum feel
that science events aimed at women are needed? Perhaps the following experience
points towards the answer...
It was a quiet day in Launch Pad, the ^Science Museum's most popular gallery. I
was standing at the School's Entrance with my clip board, waiting to welcome a school
group who were due to arrive. Clusters of uniformed lads began to arrive, and eventually
the teacher appeared. "Sorry we're late", she said. "The group's split into three and some
have gone to the V&A or the Natural History Museum." I briefed the group and they
went into the gallery. The teacher herself looked at a bit of a loose end so I asked her
about the school. Were the boys studying science? Well, she said, they were A level stu-
dents and were studying various subjects. Was the group from a boy's school? "No, but
all the girls have gone to the Natural History Museum", she said.
In this week's S-files, find out why womens science night happened from the people
who were involved.
