Clued Up
Frater Fiam writes
Once more in transit sub urbe, your
Frater's train was delayed incom-
prehensibly within the depths of a
shaft, at which point a painted lady
whined, "god, it's like a bad
dream". This pitiful woman was
fortunate that I failed to vent my
acidic reply. She should think
herself lucky, for if the worst
nightmare that her id could
produce is being delayed in a train
then her nights must be far more
placid than mine own. Her
comment did however provide an
astute observation on the state of
the modern world, in that it's too
damn safe.
Food is presented to one in
diet friendly packs, vehicles shuttle
one back and forth in air
conditioned warmth, healthcare
and policing is provided to prevent
one experiencing the slightest
moment of hardship and the
greatest damage one can expect
from one's job is RSI. Even for that,
one can sue. Our race has striven
for this cushioning airbag for
millenia, and it is now here; but it
has one overriding, all devouring
drawback.
One could say that Homo
Sapiens has become Homo
Impotens. No worry, no hardship
and nothing to do; yea, the world
has sunk into that most deadening
of concepts, Banality. People are
free to plod through life without
exercising a fraction of their
capabilities. They need not act,
move or think. All that's left is the
soap opera mentality of day to day
obsessions, the minutae of the
supermarket. For some time I
detested this state of affairs, but
recently its one redeeming feature
became apparent. The pastel
shade banality has a backlash of
producing random, sporadic
outbursts of senseless and horrific
violence.
This perfect ease of life is its
own worst enemy. Artists rile
against it, youth fights back. Look
at the delicate lunacy of the
E l s e y / P e r e g r i n i murders.
Inconceivable during wartime
ravages, but plausible, nay
necessary in this acultural
mindstate. Look at Bulger, at the
'Fairy Liquidator'. With nothing to
worry about, these people invent
their own nightmares and create a
world worth inhabiting. The mind
needs more than just the minimum,
it needs to be pushed to its own
extremes. Hardship, destruction
and pain are the easy routes out. I
f
you wish to ponder this awhile, I
shall give you some choice
fragments of thought:
"My soul is lying half to hell. Nothing seems worth living for. I am not a
boy. I am a machine that lives. No feelings." Richard Elsey, murderer
"When and where and why did hate - and a new strain of hate - come into
the consciousness of the young?" Bernard Levin, columnist
"the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees,
now the only thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease" Trent
Reznor, poet. The Downward Spiral reached 2 in the US album charts.
POLITICAL SCIENCE
I know it's a fairly post-modernist
thing to do, but it's time to ask
what this column is about. The
title, Political Science, doesn't give
that much away: the Politics of
Science (as opposed to the Science
of Politics). But what are the Politics
of Science? And why should I talk
about it here, at Imperial?
Let this be clear from the
start: this is not an anti-science
piece. If it were, then it would
attract no audience here at
debates. And, very recently, Roger
Penrose has made some very
woolly attempts to set up quantum
theory as the basis of consci-
ousness. If we don't have
something like Science, then
debates will be of this quality.
Clearly, this is not the way to go.
So, no, this is not an anti-Science
piece.
But Science, like any other
-ism or system, has its orthodoxy.
This column is an argument
against it. My thesis still remains
that Imperial is producing mainly
"Imperial graduates cannot think
beyond their domain..."
Imperial. Indeed, I don't think I
could or would write an anti-
science piece. I think it was Popper
who said that Science, like
Democracy, is a great leveller. It
may not be the best method we
can come up with, but it serves its
purpose equitably and adequately.
Philosophers have tried to
criticise Science as a process.
Feyerabend, for instance, sees
Science as a phase in history, to be
replaced by another, more superior
one. But it feels wrong to see
Science as only a phase in some
Knowledge-Inquiry process. If we
didn't have rational, argumentative
enquiry, what would replace it?
Imperial has already seen the "
I
am right, you are wrong"-type
"well-behaved engineers". These
graduates are orthodox in every
sense of the word. They do not,
can not, think beyond their
domain. They can apply formulae
and remember facts, but they are
not radical and not flexible, and
leave themselves and the world a
worse place. Classical music and
economics too have their orthodox
players, so I am not singling out
Science.
This is not an anti-Science
piece: this is a column against
orthodoxy. I want to question your
assumptions. More than that, I
want you to question your
assumptions. I want to create some
mefa-doubt in your process.
