A sweet discourse, short of coarse, from brilliant wit, to a simple...

Tragic Comic?
Dear Felix,
Your guest editor, Marcus
Alexander, must be too subtle an
ironist for me. In greeting Richard
Phillips' extraordinary piece of self
abasing authority-worship (Letters,
18 November) with a gushing "too
darn right", he must, I suppose,
have had his tongue in his cheek.
That is certainly suggested by his
bizarre style of writing and his
peculiar, Groeco-Roman, name
which clearly he has invented.
But there is danger in satire.
Ignorant people like me, whose
sense of humour is less sophisti-
cated than his, may be duped into
thinking that he really believes the
nonsense he writes. Dullards that
we are, we may suppose that he
actually thinks that because Britain
is not a police state, it follows that
it could never become one. We
may suspect him of being
genuinely unable to see why
criminalising peaceful demon-
strations might run counter to
democratic principles. Worst of all,
we may accept at face value his
hilarious injunction to "buy a suit"
if we want to change things.
True comic writing is rare, and
Marcus Alexander is a master of it.
But he should consider making his
wit a little more obvious, or the less
sharp amongst us may simply
mistake him for a stupid, shallow
-minded reactionary.

Marcus Alexander has always struck
me as a peculiar person. His
delicately woven words, to the less
astute amongst us, may at times be
a bit too subtle. But I read his res-
ponse thinking (hoping?) his tongue
was placed firmly in his cheek.
Call me naive but up until a few
weeks ago I would not have
believed that a democratic society
would question the right to peaceful
protest and demonstration. The
Criminal Justice Act does question
this fundamental principle. More-
over it challenges some of our basic
human rights (and the way we
should live our lives). At such times
protest is all that remains.
I suggest we consult our good
Frater (as indeed I'm sure Marcus
would likewise advise) to seek a
meaningful explanation to this
predicament.

"The Secretive Brown Logs"
To the anonymous shits who wrote
to FELIX concerning the advert
for the Wing Chun club. I read your
letter while I was having a shit last
week and I can't get over how
much you remind me of the big,
fat, smelly turd I'd just done.
If you come and wipe my arse
for me next time I'm taking a shit, I
might see fit to show you some
evidence of our club's achieve-
ment's. But being such smelly
shiters, you won't have the balls or
bottle to show up. So every time we
take a shit, we'd think of you.

Exquisite! I must say I couldn't have
dropped it better myself. I read the
letter too, although it failed to
agitate my bowels quite so violently.
You may laugh, but I have
always been of the opinion that
martial arts were created to teach
self-control, mentally and physically,
not social ladder climbing. As the
Wing Chun advert (over which all
this arose) said: "We will endeavour
to find you the road to spiritual
enlightenment...". A noble pledge,
one which doesn't seem to go hand
in hand with anal toilet antics.
To all of you astounded by this
flagrant ill-use of space, I say it is,
after all, your prerogative to do so.
