Xmas Issue Warning
Next week's FELIX will be the
same as usual. Hurrah! But the
week after will see a change, in
that there will be no issue at all.
This allows us to prepare a big
Christmas issue for the last
Wednesday of term. That's two
issues left, for those who are still
suffering Freshers' Week hang-
overs. Doesn't time fly? Yeah,
well go see a priest...
Fairy Story
Once there was a vast Empire.
The sun would set as another
rose (well, for the residents with
all-night computers access) and
the populace lived their lives
oblivious to those governing
them. Even the parliament of the
land was doubtful, saying: "Oh
why are we rulers afraid of an
invisible hand that never stirs?
We know best how to rule..." So
the scribes wrote new laws, that
would leave the populace to live
and the parliament to govern.
Now, not all the realm had
been tamed, and in the deepest
woods and the lands that pinned
the coastline to the sea, there
lived those who abided by their
own laws, contemptuous of the
distant rulers. Delegates were
sent to the heart of the Empire,
to petition the king. And the
king said, this can be so and that
cannot be so. The delegates left,
feeling they had achieved all they
could against so mighty a foe.
The day to ratify the new
laws came. The pamphleteers of
Phallux spread the news but the
populace walked quiet. Only
those closest to the seat of
government spoke, and thus they
were agreed upon.
It came to pass that the
distant tribes heard this and said:
"Our own tribe outnumbers
those who spoke by two-hands to
one finger. We ought go, and
speak our mind as one. If that is
how the citizens of the Empire
will it, then that shall be so..."
The day of the second, final,
reading of the laws was upon the
land. The pamphleteers of
Phallux spread the news but the
populace walked quiet. Yet in the
great Meeting Place, hordes from
the distant realm battled for
space. "See us, and see our
might," quoth they. And the
government saw them. "Until
such day as the Empire touches
us, we shall not be touched by the
penny-pinchers of the Empire,"
they decreed, and, given that the
populace was elsewhere, the law
was written. But Queen revealed
a new power behind the throne,
and said that the laws were not
hers to make. The audience were
confused. "Then you must tell
true lawmaker how it shall be!"
And the queen agreed.
Thus, the massed tribes left
and were happy. The heads of the
Empire were happy too, for
though the numbers who they
brought were low, they knew
they would never face massive
interest in the laws again. (Such
power had now been removed).
And the chief pamphleteer of
Phallux, who had laughed often
at the the joyous site of the
massed gathering was almost
happy. He knew that this week's
writing was assured. But his
heart was heavy, for he also knew
that there would never be such
massive interest seen again...
Name Dropping
Readers eager to know who
penned the article 'Another
Picture, Another Planet' on page
11 may be stricken to find no
name. This wasn't to protect the
innocent, and certainly not due
to shyness on the author's part -
rather a mistake at the sub-
editing stage. The guilty kitten
has been sent to the crocodiles
that dwell in the basement of
F E L I X T O W E R S (Gran), so
the good name of Natasha Loder
should be safe in future.
Talk, talk, talk...
We hear about the great things
Imperial students go on to do,
without always hearing what
those great things actually are.
Our new series of interviews will
hopefully overcome this in a non-
college propagandaesque way.
The series will feature MP's,
Captains of Industry, media
figures and Zoo Keepers, and it
all starts on page 7.
