Nanni Moretti stars in, directs and
wrote Dear Diary and with its very
personal topic every aspect of the
film's production remains under his
strict control. With this in mind, it's
not surprising to find out that
Moretti is the closest thing we get
to a European Woody Allen.
Though unknown in the UK, he has
a cult following in Italy and the rest
of Europe and Dear Diary has
already won him the prestigious
award of the Best Director in the
Cannes Film Festival.
The film is about himself and
comprises of three parts; 'On my
Vespa', where Moretti admires the
sights of Rome; 'Islands' where he
takes a trip to the Eolian islands
with a friend; and finally 'Doctors',
which shows Moretti's dealings with
Italian doctors.
When it comes to the entire
film little can be said, although the
topics touched upon are easy to
relate to. This is especially true in
the last chapter where the film
becomes slightly darker. Moretti
has an itch that never goes away
and it keeps him up at night.
Finally, after many deferred
consultations, he is diagnosed as
having a tumour.
Despite the prestigious award
this film has received, there was
little to keep me interested. The
main problem was that an autobio-
graphical account of Moretti's own
life has no appeal to me. That's not
to say that this film bad. It's funny
and it's confident in telling the
audience about Moretti's hidden
thoughts and ideas and the
photography is excellent. But a
personal account of someone's life
does not constitute as a good topic
to make a film on.
Only see this film if you have a
desire to see a European type
Woody Allen film.
In A G o o d M a n in Africa,
Morgan Leafy (Coiln Friels), a British
mid-level diplomat stationed in an
emerging African nation, has two
passions in his life: women and
alcohol. It just so happens that the
African nation owns large oil fields
which the British want, and it is
Morgan's job to get the an
agreement between Britain and the
new President Adekunle (Louis
Gossett Jr.) However, Adekunle
blackmails Morgan to bribe the
only good man in Africa, Dr. Alex
Murray (Sean Connery), who is
vetoing a development project of
Adekunle's. Gradually, through his
conversations with Murray, Morgan
begins to open his eyes to what is
going on around him. His values
finally begin to change, and at the
end of the film he promises Murray
to become more like him so that
there will be at least one good man
in Africa.
This is in no way an involving
film and certainly not a master-
piece. It merely seems to be a
sequence of not particularly
amusing scenarios strung together
by a semblance of a plot. The
scenarios seem to be based on
either sexual innuendo or the
contrast between African and
British cultures.
None of the characters are
more than paper-weight, with the
exception of Morgan. He, on the
other hand, undergoes such a
drastic and seemingly inexplicable
character metamorphosis that it
makes Norman Bates look normal.
Sean Connery, in a role which was
written for him, does little more
than be Scottish and play a round
of golf.
In short this is a light-weight,
unamusing movie which has an
irritating air of smugness. Q
AC ventures into the throbbing heart of Soho, past the siren
calls of 'made to measure meals', to Pasta Fino. It's a place
where the spaghetti definitely doesn't grow on trees.
In an uninspiring week, Magpie rides around on the vespa
roadster that is Dear Diary, while C.A.Berry endures the
travelling tartan offered by A Good Man in Africa.
More goatees this week as the most fabulous and most groovy
Rahul attacks the singles with a vigour he usually reserves for
his patients.
Joseph Ban follows the white rabbit backwards in time in the
Royal National Theatre's new play Alice's Adventures
Underground.
The Consort Gallery (or the Sherfield ante-room to the rest of
us) has a new exhibition entitled Still Lives. A past master at
musical statutes, Patrick Wood went along to see for himself.
According to those in the know IQ and Lovehangover
Fashion Show are the places to be seen at. Fiona shuffles
her nights and gives us the lowdown.
Tom Petty's 44 and still just an old hick playing his guitar.
Tintin looks at his new album before rolling with the Indigo
Girls live. Vik straps on wih Helmet and James Thomson gets
the Celtic charms of the Tansads.
Patrick Woods returns, this time in the role of classical critic
to give his opinion of Hans Werner Henze's Requiem.

It's easy to walk past Pasta Fino.
At street level the hungry
pedestrian sees a delightful fresh
pasta shop but no sign of a
restaurant. Only by entering the
store and descending the spiral
staircase do you find the more
intimate half of this emporium.
From the dozen soups and
starters on offer we chose the
agliata (raw vegetables with a
garlic dip, £2.40) and the pane
tricolore (bread baked with olives,
sun-dried tomatoes and salami,
£2.10). The agliata was a whole-
some, satisfying start, but failed to
ignite the plentiful vegetables with
an eruption of garlic. Its blandness
was highlighted by the stunning
garlic bread. Freshly baked in
individual round loaves, the bread
was crisp and crunchy on the
outside, soft and succulent in the
centre, and oozing with herby,
golden, garlic butter.
Main courses are dominated
by a plentiful selection of pizza and
pasta (all dishes £ 4 - £ 7 ) .
Vegetarian dishes provide the
mainstay of the menu, with meat
taking a quiet backseat.
One of the speciality fresh
pastas sold in the shop and served
in the restaurant is gnocchi. This
potato pasta is served with pesto
and cream (gnocchi genovaise,
£5.95). To those who have not
come across pesto before, this dish
provides a good introduction to the
trendiest flavour of 1994. The
pungent combination of basil,
garlic and parmesan bound
together by pine nuts and olive oil
can be overpowering, but
combined with cream the flavour is
toned down and the sauce
becomes far more accessible. With
the light and spongy gnocchi, this
often rich and heavy dish was very
easily digested.
The pasta finale (£3) provided
an original and fun end to the
meal. The construction of chocolate
fudge sauce, ice cream and
whipped cream around a platform
of fresh chocolate pasta was quirky
but tasty.
With cheapish and above
average house wine (£7.50 a
bottle), this little restaurant is a
warm and friendly escape from the
expensive trattoria that litter Soho.
The menu is simple, the food is
fresh and the potions satisfyingly
large. This is good Italian food at
very reasonable prices. 0
