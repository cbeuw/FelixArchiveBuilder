(Mary's Storm IC continues...)
Criticising St Mary's handling of
the matter, Fiona stated: "they
have had every opportunity to
change the constitution" during
the consultation process earlier
this year.
She said that it was generally
accepted that St Mary's would
not be "immediately expected" to
adhere to that particular section
until the school moves over to
the South Kensington site
anyway. "They would be given
breathing space" she added.
STOIC Slip Up
JE JX
BY L Y N N BRAVEY
Sam Scotcher, Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU) Vice-
President, was hit on the head by
a tripod during last Friday's
Union General Meeting (UGM).
Sam had to be taken to
hospital after the STOIC
equipment fell from an 8 foot
high platform. The tripod was
being used by the STOIC team
who were trying to film and take
photographs of the UGM, which
had the largest attendance for
many years.
Piers Williams, STOIC
chair, said, "nobody really knows
what happened", but he admitted
that Brian Crotaz, STOIC
Technical Manager, had said that
he might have knocked it over.
He blamed the 'absolute chaos' of
the over-crowded UGM for the
tragic incident.
The accident caused the start
of the meeting to be delayed.
Lucy Chothia, Imperial College
Union (ICU) President,
announced that there had been
"a bit of an accident at the back",
with one of the many St. Mary's
students retorting, "Is there a
doctor in the house?" The
uproarious laughter which
followed suggested that few
people realised the extent of
Sam's injuries.
Sam was given first aid
treatment by Graham Innes,
Sherfield Security Guard, and
was then taken to St Mary's
Hospital.
Miss Scotcher told F E L I X
that she spent two and a half
hours in casualty but was told
that she had suffered no serious
damage. She has, she said,
remained at home following the
accident and was "taking it easy".
No apology has been
received by Miss Scotcher from
STOIC for the accident as
F E L I X went to press.
Thanks to St Mary's presence, last Friday's UGM probably was one of the
most excitingfor years, writes John Sinner, but it wasn't the only mark they
left on Imperial. Sources in Wilson House, St Mary's hall of residence,
spotted a poster last week featuring a T-shaped diagram and the words:
"We've given IC an early Christmas present. It looks great from above"
'present' turned out to be graffiti, sprawled across the roofover the Concou
between Mech Eng and Elec Eng. It was first reported on Tuesday, 15th
November and is thought to be a by-product of one of the Rag-Week event
So far it is not showing any signs of washing off. With no specific interest
group within St Mary's claiming responsibility for the action, their CCU
president, Claire Moloney, felt it inappropriate to comment.
Flicking Hockey Club Face Penalty
BY TED W. SHIRMAN
Following drunken incidents in
Da Vinci's bar Imperial College
Hockey Club (ICHC) face a fine
of £115. The club is being asked
to pay for the replacement of a
number of panels, after tampons
soaked in beer were thrown at
the ceiling.
It is alleged that at the time,
the hockey club agreed to pay for
the ceiling panels, something
which they dismiss as a single
member's comment. It is now
proposed that the club repair the
brown marks, while the Union
Executive Committee has
deferred its final decision until
next Monday.
The ICHC feel victimised
because being an easily
identifiable group they are being
singled out unfairly. "We're
quite happy to go up and scrub
it, paint it, and so on, but we
don't feel that it needs to be
replaced", said Stephanie
Couchman, the women's team
captain. Members of Imperial
College Union Executive
Committee feel differently, with
Dan Look, ICU Vice President
(Finance & Services), putting
forward the case for replacing of
the tiles. He is understood to
think that only the club should
pay, as opposed to the money
coming from general funds,
which would penalise all
students.
With the hockey club
boycotting Da Vinci's last
Wednesday, and talk of other
sports clubs joining them, the
financial impact is also being
raised. The hockey club point to
the fact that Wednesday is
known as the night when the
sports clubs' members spend
large amounts of money in the
Union. They claim that if this
was to cease the Union would
lose considerable trade, with the
money going instead to the
Southside bar.
While the hockey club
admit responsibility, Rachel
Curran, a member of the club's
committee, says that if the £115
charge is imposed they would
regard it as "unfair treatment".
However they will have to wait
until Monday to see if the club
will have to pay.
Vinod Fernandez, Royal
School of Mines President and
member of the ICU Exec which
rules on the matter, feels
differently remarking "Bars are
for drinking in and not for
playing with tampons."
