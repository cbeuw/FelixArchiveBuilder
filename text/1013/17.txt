erasure - /' love Saturday ep
The 'Saturday' bandwagon rolls
on but still no mention of the
Brookie omnibus; Andy and
Vince continue to flog their
charfsfriendly kitsch wares but
this just reeks of dead horse.

Lewis Carroll is known by many as
the popular author of Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland. Perhaps
it's less well known that Carroll also
indulged in photography using
young girls, often naked, as his
subject matter .
Alice's A d v e n t u r e s U n d e r
Ground, a new play running at the
Royal National Theatre, has been
adapted by Christopher Hampton
(of Dangerous Liaisons fame) from
the writings of Lewis Carroll. It
attempts to explore this darker side
of Carroll's relationship with
children, in particular Alice Liddell,
for whom Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland was written. The result
is a thought provoking and
somewhat disturbing play.
The production centres around
favourite scenes from Carroll's
more famous works such as the
Mad Hatter's Tea party and the
Tweedledum-Tweedledee episode.
These are cleverly interwoven with
sketches depicting real life dialogue
between Carroll and Alice Liddell.
This creates a charming and, at
times, delightfully confusing play
that never fails to stimulate and
amuse.
The acting is both versatile and
engaging, coming from well
established actors (Michael
Moloney, John Carlisle, Gabrielle
Lloyd, Joseph Mydell and Sasba
Hanau as Alice). In addition the
stage set is wonderfully lopsided,
heightening the dreamy atmo-
sphere created by Carroll's childlike
imagination.
One leaves the performance
feeling thoroughly entertained and
although the play insinuates that
Carroll was sexually attracted to
Alice, it ultimately allows you to
draw your own conclusions. The
mystery surrounding Lewis Carroll's
true feelings towards young girls is
likely to remain unsolved. Q
static ^ destinations full ahead
The new Still Lifes exhibition in
the Consort Gallery brings a
splash of colour to the Sherfield
Building. Three contemporary
artists are represented. The most
arresting pictures, by the American
painter Judith Rothchild, are
glowing pastels of brightly
coloured fabrics. The best, though,
are the intricately detailed
lithographs by German printmaker
Malte Sartorius. Full of texture and
shadows, his rustic pictures of
baskets, sieves and bottles seem
to glow with bright sunlight.
The third artist, Lydia Corbett,
cheats a bit by adding people and
animals to her watercolours of
vases and flowers. She was
Picasso's muse in the 50s, and
also on display is an article from
She magazine about her
relationship with him. This doesn't
do her any favours, coyly skirting
around the most interesting
question ie viz Did She Sleep With
Him? (Sorry, I mean Sl**p W*th
H*m.) In style her figures veer
between Cocteau and Ronald
Searle, via Hokusai and of course
Pablo P himself. 0
"The biggest event of its kind this
month" IQ is not the night to miss.
Hopscotch Promotions, the minds
behind many a successful event in
the past, now present "A fiery
concoction of hip-hop, swing,
jungle, jazz, funk 'n' boogie classics
in two parts". The superb DJ line up
includes Chris Phillips (Kiss FM),
Brian Norman (Fresh and Funky-
Iceni), Daddy Bug (Kiss) and main
man Jasper the Vinyl Junkie
(Choice FM, Funkin' Pussy). Added
to all this resident excellence,
Alison Evelyn plays live. My
recommendation? Cancel any other
plans you had for tonight and join
me there.
IQ takes place at Ormonds, 97
Jermyn St, Piccadilly SW7. Running
from 10 'til 3.30, the score on the
door is £8 - which works out as a
pound per DJ and the live music for
free. Not bad for a quality Friday.
For fashion conscious clubbers,
tomorrow night is the second of this
month's big ones. This Saturday is
the date of the Lovehangover
Fashion Show as part of a limited
edition night running at
Subterrania. A personal favourite,
this venue comes with excellent
crowd and atmosphere guaranteed.
DJs present include Mark Moore,
Phil Asher, Tallulah and Norman
(can music get any better?) Jay.
Style directions are generated by
Hair Warehouse, Souled Out,
Jimmy Beez and ... C.A.T. Condoms
so polish your hormones! You'd be
a fool to miss it, especially as with
World AIDS Day in mind all
proceeds go to Body Positive and
Body Positive Women's Section.
This event creates an £8 sized hole
in your pocket or just £6 with flyer
(available from the FELIX office).
Subterrania is under the
Westway off Portobello Rd - just
follow the crowd. If you haven't
been there yet, this is the ideal
opportunity to try it.
In sum, get limbered up, dress
funky and be ready to party this
weekend with the cream of
London's late night crowd.
*Shock Rumour Recently In*
Iceni isn't the only club with
licensing problems. I
f you've been
meaning to go to Club UK and
haven't, get there soon. There will
be no licence renewal this time. 0
