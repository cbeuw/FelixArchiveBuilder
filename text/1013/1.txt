Mary's Storm Imperial College
BY MICHAEL L U D L A M
Over 200 students from St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
swamped the Union General
Meeting (UGM) last Friday to
vote through an amendment to
the new Union constitution.
Uproarious scenes were wit-
nessed as over 450 people packed
into the Union Ents lounge, a
massive increase on the last
UGM's turnout of only 40.
St Mary's are attempting to
retain their college's financial
independence until they move to
the South Kensington site. The
three other constituent college
unions are now set to receive
money through Imperial College
Union (ICU). The President of
St Mary's Union will still be
responsible to the Dean and the
Director of Finance at St
Mary's; in contrast, the other
unions will have to answer to the
President and Deputy President
(Finance and Services) of ICU.
At the meeting, Claire Maloney,
President of St Mary's Union,
said that she was introducing the
amendment to protect the clubs
and societies that St Mary's
Union supports. She emphasised
that this would only continue
"for as long as St Mary's
remains at Paddington".
It is still possible that the
constitution will go ahead
without the St Mary's
amendment because it has not
been passed at two UGM's. It is
now up to the governing body of
IC to decide whether or not to
accept it. The original
constitution has already passed
through two UGM's.
Lucy Chothia, I C U
President, was pressed to back
the motion when St Mary's
removed her from the chair to
give her voting rights. A second
ballot was held, which she
supported, saying that there was,
"a lot for them to lose". St
Mary's mandated the I C U
President to "fight our corner
bloody hard" should the board of
governors try to throw out the
amendment.
While Vinod Fernandez,
President of the Royal School of
Mines, abstained from the vote,
Charlie Bell, President of the
Royal College of Science Union
and Fiona Grandison, President
of the City and Guilds College
Union both voted against the
amendment.

Imperial College Rag have been
instructed not to sell their
magazine on University of
London Union premises.
U L U Sabbaticals have
refused the IC Rag's request for
permission to distribute it.
Gemma Williams, U L U
President, contacted Lucy
Chothia, Imperial College Union
President, insisting that the
refusal was not a reflection on
Imperial College itself.
Despite the pictures of
pierced genitalia, U L U were said
to be most offended by the front
Rag Mag
cover that depicts the Moors
Murderers' Myra Hindley and
Ian Braidy collecting for a
children's charity. Ms Williams
said that she has received a series
of complaints about the
magazine, and that she was
'forced to act'.
If Rag decide to ignore
ULU's order they will remove
face expulsion and a possible
ban, from ULU's premises, and
probable disciplinary action
from ICU. The magazine is still
on sale in Imperial and since no
motion was submitted at last
week's U G M , will probably
continue to be available for the
rest of the year.
