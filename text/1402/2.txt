Queen’s Lawn comes under
shadow of student body
IC students pounced at the chance of invading the desolate
Queen’s Lawn this week, basking in the glorious sunshine whilst
College’s fleet of marquees takes a well-earned break from hosting
numerous business-types and conference-goers. Several students
insisted that using the lawn during the exam period is a welcome
break from stuffy libraries and crowded computer rooms. However
they were obviously too intoxicated with the spirit of freedom to
be taken seriously. News that several members of College staff,
when approached by this reporter, said they were “too busy
sunbathing” to comment, is completely unfounded.
Last week, a student was taken to
hospital after falling from a first floor
window in Southwell Hall. The inci-
dent occurred in the early hours of the
morning on Monday 28th April.
Emergency services, including the
fire brigade, were called to the scene.
There they were required to cut the
student free, since he had fallen onto
the railings below, avoiding a two-floor
drop into the basement entrance area.
The student was taken to hospital
and initially put on life support. South-
well Hall Warden Nick Voulvoulis told
Felix that since the incident, the stu-
dent has “[undergone] surgery and is
now recovering well.”
Students affected by the incident
were offered counselling. If you would
like further support, feel free to contact
the College’s Counselling Service by
telephoning 020 759 49637 or emailing
counselling@imperial.ac.uk.

Plethora of Union positions up for grabs
Kadhim Shubber
Politics Editor
Nominations are currently open for
many, many positions throughout
the Union. Students can stand
for positions within the Fac-
ulty Union they belong to (ie:
RCSU, CGCU or ICSMU),
the department they are in, or
within Imperial College Un-
ion (ICU) itself. Nomina-
tions close at 11:59pm on
Sunday. If you don’t want to
stand yourself, voting for the majority
of elections opens on 19th May, except
for the Engineering elections which
open on Monday 12th May.
The most important positions to be
elected are the Faculty Union Presi-
dents. The Presidents are
responsible for over-
seeing, and represent-
ing the views and wel-
fare of thousands of
students, often in
meetings with
College and ICU
bigwigs. They’ll
probably organise the
occasional hella-
mashup too.
Within the
Faculty Unions
are the departmental
societies (ie: Physoc, Civsoc,
etc). Each one will be elect-
ing a committee – much like
a club or society’s commit-
tee – which communicates with
their respective Faculty Un-
ion and lecturers and
demonstrators in each
department.
The final positions
up for grabs are within
ICU, such as the Council
Chair, who is responsible
for steering debate (while
remaining completely im-
partial) in the Union’s policy
making meetings, the RAG
(Raising And Giving) Chair,
who organises fund-raising
events throughout the year,
and more.
Look out for students cam-
paigning and head to www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/
vote to make your choice.
