No laughing matter
I
can’t help but feel that Boris is
too easy a target this week – not
just in physical terms, in the
sense that photos of him cycling
to work look like they’ve been
taken from a leaflet raising awareness
about cruelty to narwhals but also in
the sense that, as many of you have
been all too quick to remind me this
week, he did get elected ‘by democratic
process’ and is thus entitled to at least
seven days of swearless seething from
me.
However, the term ‘by democratic
process’ tends to conceal all manner of
evils nowadays. These evils are largely
concerned with America of course,
and thus I get to put on a kind of be-
mused smile whilst watching it happen
much like the rest of the country did
last Friday when the election results
were announced. However, occasion-
ally America’s older brother gets pissed
and starts beating his political process
of a wife, and it’s at that point that hu-
mour gives way to horror.
Somehow, in the clamour and sweaty
palms of last Friday, five percent of the
Londoners that went out to put a cross
in a box next to the phrase ‘British Na-
tional Party’. The London Assembly
now bears that terrible phrase on its
website, when referring to its mem-
bers. This means that we, as a City,
have failed.
I can go on for hours – ask my girl-
friend – about any topic you like.
Throw one at me. I’ll rant for hour af-
ter hour, plucking out as colourful an
insult as I can at each occasion. I’ll slap
you around a bit, draw out pie charts
representing the distribution of all the
reasons why your opinion is worthless,
I’ll even cajole you into insulting your-
self if I’m on a particularly good streak.
It’s great fun, even if a little hypocrisy
slips in here or there.
That’s why Boris is a good target. I
re-read my piece from last Autumn
about Boris’ impending election, and I
stand by it – the man’s a buffoon, and
the Tories pushed him forward in order
to seize control of the mayoral hotseat.
However, there’s a distinction between
Boris – a walking joke who we can all
chuckle at in publications much like
this – and Richard Barnbrook, who is
absolutely no laughing matter at all. At
all.
Let’s get one thing straight first, and
I feel a certain level of appropriateness
in quoting Marcus Brigstocke here –
“the BNP are racist, and if you vote for
them, so are you”. There is no middle
ground here, there is no distortion of
the truth, there is no quiet revolution.
There is just a political party based
around a contorted idea of patriotism,
and on the other side there is the sane
portion of the population. That’s the
end of the story.
I like to think that not a single one
of you reading this voted for them.
The thought that someone at Imperial,
someone young and passionate about
their future in whatever form, would
actually stand up and say they believed
in the BNP’s values makes me sick
thinking about it. And I don’t think
enough people are making this clear.
Members of the London Assembly
have already stated that they will not
work with Barnbrook, who also gained
a seat on the Assembly. That’s all well
and good. But unfortunately, in the
interests of fair politics, some people
have chosen to stand up and give the
same line I was fed about Boris. Barn-
brook was elected democratically. He
deserves his chance to represent those
that voted for him.
Bullshit. There’s a difference between
someone like Boris and someone like
Barnbrook. Here it is – you can tell a
joke about Boris’ party and still laugh
afterwards.
See, we can banter about Boris
on these pages, and have a good old
chuckle. I can tell you that the way he’s
been transformed through PR over the
previous few weeks makes it look like
they’ve fitted some kind of cybernetic
implant into his head like the one they
used to control beetles via remote. I
like the idea of Gordon Brown sitting
in the audience during Newsnight, tap-
ping responses into his mobile before
texting them off to the receiver hidden
underneath the floppy hair.
But with Barnbrook, there are no
jokes. We can’t afford to joke about
it. There’s just a clear dividing line, a
point where democracy stops becom-
ing important and everything can be
swept aside in favour of simply saying
no. No debate. No discussion. We don’t
need to ask what merits they have, what
part they play in the system. There is
no question of democratic process, of
due right, or of representation. There
is only one question – who is voting for
the British National Party? And why?
These questions need to be answered
before the next general election. Be-
cause the answers are the only way
we’ll remove this anomaly from British
Politics. Ironically, it is not immigra-
tion, nor the EU that makes me feel like
I do not own the word ‘British’. It’s the
quasi-racists that grow year on year
that make me feel ashamed to admit to
my nationality. If you want to reclaim
this country, then the BNP are the ex-
tremists that have to go first.

quoting
Marcus
Brigstocke here:
“the BNP are
racist, and if you
vote for them, so
are you”
” Dear Felix,
Its 2.30 am on the Sunday after the
elections and I’m still awake, so-
ber as a judge. Whilst this may not
seem surprising during exam sea-
son at Imperial, what with all the
night owls populating the library
at all hours, I’m not awake for revi-
sion. I’m awake because something
has been buzzing around my head
since I saw the election results for
the General London Assembly. The
British National Party, that cham-
pion of the British right wing, has
won a seat. That means they got over
5% of the London-wide vote. It also
means that whilst before I was proud
of being a Londoner born and bred, I
am also now a bit embarrassed.
All the mainstream mayoral can-
didates wax lyrical about how Lon-
don is a diverse, multicultural and
vibrant city yet the BNP still manage
to get a seat. How? I suppose it isn’t
that important, I accept that we live
in a democracy and that they now
have every right to that seat. But I
have a niggling sense it could have
been avoided.
Many people I spoke to leading up
to the election told me they were vot-
ing for Boris because he was a joker,
a legend, against Ken because they
didn’t like him as a person. Their
choice, they can vote on personal-
ity in a political contest if they will.
What makes me uncomfortable is
how many told me they weren’t vot-
ing at all because they didn’t know or
care about the candidates’ policies,
and that was for the well-publicised
mayoral election. How many had
even given a thought to the GLA?
Think about it for a moment, how
many people out there didn’t vote
for similar reasons? With a turnout
of less than 50% I think we can safely
assume a hell of a lot.
Now, pretty much anyone that
supports the BNP will have turned
out to vote for them. They are good
at getting those who agree with them
to act. But what of all those people
out there that find the BNP and its
policies worrying, offensive and in
some cases even threatening? Many
of them will have voted for a party
they find more palatable in the GLA
elections, but many won’t have voted
at all. I’m sure some of Felix’s read-
ers are amongst them. The question
is do they actively disagree with the
BNP? Did the ones disagreeing with
them do anything to prevent them
gaining the 5% that won them a seat?
Well done to them if they did, but if
they didn’t: well, I can’t force them
to vote but I can tell them that they
worry me almost as much as the
BNP do.
I’m scared by the fact that the apa-
thy of our society is providing the
conditions for what I consider the
political face of the National Front
to gain a foothold in London. A foot-
hold that they deserve in democratic
terms, but that I cannot believe rep-
resents their actual London-wide
popularity. If it does, my embarrass-
ment at their apparent popularity in
London is justified. If it doesn’t, all I
can do is hope that next time people
will do something to stop them….
Yours,
Matthew Kaufeler
The BNP and
society’s
political apathy
Boris Johnson: Joke and inset, Richard Barnbrook: No joke
“
With
Barnbrook, there
are no jokes.
We can’t afford
to joke about it.
Have Londoners failed as a collective because Richard Barnbrook has
been successfully elected to the London Assembly?
