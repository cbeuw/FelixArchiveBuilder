Election Results
United States
Barack Obama has gained victory in the North Carolina
Democratic primary, winning 56% of the vote, while
Hillary Clinton narrowly won in Indiana with a 51%
majority. Obama was once again hoping for a knock-
out blow that would end Clinton’s campaign, however
this result was not enough to extinguish her hopes of
victory. After the results, Clinton declared “full speed
on to the White House”.
Presidential Run-off
Zimbabwe
After weeks of waiting, and a controversial recount,
officalelectionresultsinZimbabweshowthatopposition
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai did indeed win the
election, but without the 50% majority required to avoid
a runoff. He gained 47.9% as opposed to Mugabe’s 43.2%.
Tsvangirai has not yet confirmed his participation in the
runoff, though if he does not contest, Mugabe will be
declared victor by default.
W
elcome to what
we hope will be
a regular fea-
ture of Felix
this term – the
International Headlines. We in the
offices flatter ourselves (and in-
sult you) in believing Felix is the
most-read newspaper on campus.
We therefore felt it was about time
we provided you with information
about what takes place outside the
walls of college.
Anything we write in this section,
this week or any other, will be pri-
marily a summary of what we deem
to be the major newsworthy events
happening worldwide. Some things
will make it in, some things won’t.
If you want to find out more about
things we mention or don’t, we sug-
gest you make the colossal effort of
checking a newspaper, news-site or
news channel.
This week, three elections, Ameri-
can foreign policy and two natural
disasters made the final cut; our
apologies to all the other gallant lit-
tle news stories which didn’t quite
make it in.
We send especial apologies to
Chile’s Llaima volcano, which,
though forcing over 6,000 people
to evacuate their homes, has not yet
killed anybody. Try harder, Llaima,
and maybe someone will pay atten-
tion. Equally sincere apologies to
Secretary of State Rice, whose ef-
forts in the Middle East have not yet
produced any results worth bother-
ing you with.
See you next week.
