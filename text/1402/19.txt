ould geoengineering - altering
global climate using technology
- be the “magic bullet” to cure
Earth’s rising fever?
[One] idea is to fire hundreds of
rockets loaded with compressed sul-
phur dioxide into the stratosphere to
create a vast but thin “sulphur sun-
screen”, which would behave like a sun-
tan lotion for our planet, increasing its
albedo, or reflectivity. Such an idea may
chime of the same bells as a big budget
science fiction film, but let us not be so
dismissive. The famous volcanic erup-
tion of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 pro-
vides evidence for this proposal which
is the brainchild of Professor Paul
Crutzen, Nobel Prize winner in 1995
for his work on the ozone layer. Twen-
ty million tonnes of sulphur dioxide
were thrust 20km into the atmosphere
where the particulates remained as a
thin veil for years, spreading around
the Earth to lower global temperatures
by a sizeable 0.6°C. The major setback
of this strategy: the simultaneous part-
destruction of the ozone.
[Another idea is] fertilising the
Earth’s oceans with iron to increase
phytoplankton activity, thus raising
their “carbon sink” capacity. In the lat-
ter, trials by SOFeX scientists in the
Southern Ocean have been successful
in initiating massive phytoplankton
blooms which acted as an effective car-
bon reservoir and boosted ecosystems.
Global warming and the fishing crisis
solved in one fell swoop? [...]
Cynics may recoil at the astronomi-
cal expense of a sulphur Sun shield
or gigantic orbiting parasol, and most
advocates of geoengineering schemes
would concede that they might not
represent the complete answer- but
they could bide us the time needed to
heal our planet, whatever the cost.

W
hilst genes do play a funda-
mental role in character, it
has been shown that envi-
ronment – particularly during devel-
opmental stages – is often far more
significant.
For instance it has been shown that
children with a mutated (under-repeat-
ed) promoter region of the monoamine
oxidase A (MAOA) gene are far more
likely than average to commit acts of
violence, but only if they are abused
while young.2 Therefore it would be
unethical to criminally penalise or
counsel an individual merely on the
basis that they carried this mutation.
A ‘bad’ genotype therefore is not a
sentence; it also requires a bad envi-
ronment to create an undesirable phe-
nome. Yet just one little diagnostic test,
of the promoter length in this one gene,
could allow a physician to predict, with
some confidence, whether one is likely
to be antisocial or probably criminal.

S
ome geo-engineering techniques
attack the root of the problem,
carbondioxide,headon.Artificial
trees which, like real trees, can absorb
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
are an option. A solution of sodium
hydroxide flows through the trees and
absorbs carbon dioxide forming so-
dium carbonate. However, in order to
release carbon dioxide, the carbonate
must be heated, which, unless a green
energy source is used, would undo the
effort made to collect the gas in the
first place. Storing the gas is another
problem. Although injecting the gas
into some geological formations, like
saline aquifers and depleted oil fields,
is claimed to be a safe manageable op-
tion, the long term effects of the proc-
ess are unknown.
Sequestration; storing carbon diox-
ide in solid minerals, is a similar meth-
od. For example, serpentine is a type
of rock found in quantities sufficient
to store the carbon dioxide produced
by the world’s entire known fossil fuel
reserves. The absorption of the gas by
the rock yields magnesite, which can
be used in bricks. The energy needed
to process and transport the rocks,
however, could take us back to square
one.
