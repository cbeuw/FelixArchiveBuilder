Fun & Games
Virgo
A few weeks after
this incident, having
dodged police
questioning, you
rediscover Pokemon
and watch every
single episode that exists on alluc.org. Later in
the day you dig out your shiny charizard, fetch
your roommate’s corpse from the cupboard
and use his mouth as a container for nacho
dipping sauce.
Scorpio
This week you have
an ‘80s and ‘90s
bands revival in
your departmental
computer room.
No, really you will.
Head to YouTube and check out the following:
Deacon Blue, Tears For Fears, The Outhere
Brothers, Curiosity Killed The Cat, S Club 7
(especially the one where Bradley raps) Scritti
Politti, Johnny Hates Jazz, Jefferson Starship,
A-Ha, Level 42 and of course Steps.
Libra
Later that week,
your sister comes to
stay and you have
to hide the body
inside your mattress.
Sigh, there goes
a perfectly good bedside cabinet. Later that
night you wander into your room finding your
new roommate pile-driving your sister which
makes the corpse roll onto the bedroom floor.
Next stop, prison, sonny Jim.
Sagittarius
This week you go
to Whole Foods to
buy a watermelon.
Ten fucking pounds
you posh bastards.
As you lug it back
to Beit Quad, you suddenly have a great idea.
You head back to Whole Foods, approach the
mostly poshly dressed 60-year old in there and
throw it as hard as you can at his groin. His co-
lostomy bag bursts over the fine cheese coun-
ter. Mmm, cheddar and stale urine. Mmm.
Capricorn
This horoscope is
a speed horoscope.
I’m going to write
the first things that
come into my head
and see what hap-
pens. Oh my god I just shot your mum with
a crossbow. She’s now leaping around your
kitchen yelping for her little tabby-cat Francis.
That’s a mighty fine linoleum flooring you’ve
got going on there. Mad props.
Cancer
Your illicit
oncological
treatment centre
was busted by the
feds today. They just
don’t understand
the blossoming love between a human-being
and a festering tumour. It would have been
less embarrassing if you hadn’t have been
wearing them when you were arrested like a
big squelchy Michelen man.
Gemini
This week you
empty your
cupboard of all
starch products
onto your bed. You
roll around in the
crispy, flakey mess, dressed only in your Papa
Smurf outfit, however, you have turned an
interesting shade of yellow instead of blue. It’s
funny how choking yourself whilst watching
Japanese-tentacle-rape-porn just doesn’t do it
for you anymore. Crunch-crunch-crunch!
Leo
This week you find
your roommate
indulging in a
bit of auto-self
asphyxiation. Your
initial apprehension
subsides and you tighten the knot of his
tie, watching him groan with excruiciating
ecstacy. You don’t stop there though. You lose
control of your nimble fingers and the noose
slowly contacts around his neck. As he dies, he
whispers “thank you...”
Taurus
This week you trawl
through last years
Felix and notice
something differ-
ent. Really fucking
hot page 3 models,
ooooh yeah. You go down to the Felix Office
and beat the Editor whilst screaming “Get
some fucking porno in the Felix, you cunt!”.
He pokes you in the eye and you stumble
blindly into a computer and electrocute your-
self. Serves you right for having an opinion.
Aries
This week you
attempt to reprint
part of L. Ron.
Hubbard’s Dianetics
in your newspaper...
...
... Hello?
Pisces
This week it’s so
hot your pores start
seaping spaff. You
wander into the
Union’s kitchens
looking for a
refreshment but instead you find the DPFS
hunting cockroaches on a skateboard. A quick
judo chop to the neck and he’s rendered prone
on the floor. Serves him right for inviting
Klaxons for a DJ set. We want to hear them
jam mannnnnnnnnnn. Nu-rave 4 life! Thug.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week the sun
shines. College
celebrates this oc-
casion by shipping
in 55 fine young
ladies from around
the world. Where were they during the winter
months, dammit, when I had nothing better
to do than wipe my snotty nose on the back of
my best friend’ss leeve?! Damn you College!
Damn you for making me fall foul of your illu-
sion, making me think this place is inhabitable!

Needy McNeedy: beating her chest since 7000BC
I
t turns out that selecting prob-
lems that don’t contain any ref-
erences to exams from the bags
of letters I receive every week is
a full-time job. Frankly, I’m too
goddamn busy and important. So, last
week’s promise is retracted. Exams are
in. Welcome to the summer term. THE
ONLY THING REQUIRED OF YOU
IN AN EXAM IS TO SIT IN A CHAIR
FOR 3 HOURS AND REGURGITATE
A SMALL PORTION OF KNOWL-
EDGE, YOU WORRYING SHITS.
Dear Needy McNeedy
This might make me sound sluttish, but
during Fresher’s Week, I had a one-night
stand with a really hot guy who I met at
the union. I knew he wasn’t a fresher,
but I didn’t know what department he
was in. It was fun, but we didn’t take
it further than that – just a one-night
thing, you know? I’m now in my sec-
ond year, and have just been assigned
a massive project. I was introduced to
my demonstrator the other day, and it
turned out to be… you guessed it… him.
What shall I do? Do you have any tips
for dealing with ex one-night stands?
CreamPie
Dear CreamPie,
Oh dear. The crucial thing in this is
that he will probably grade you on your
performance in bed. Think back to the
night. If you did any of the following
things: going on top, keeping on your
high heels, using your mouth, then
you’ll probably do quite well. If you
vomited on him, or kneed him in the
balls accidently, then get revising for
those exams; you’re going to need to
make up the extra marks somewhere! If
neither of you decided to make contact
with each other after the event, then
expect the worse, although given that
you were just some random Fresher,
you can hope that he just can’t remem-
ber anything about that night.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I found a 50p coin down the drain the
other day. I was not best pleased. My
friend managed to find a £10 note!
What did I do to deserve this?
Unjustified
Dear Unjustified,
Shut up.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I can’t sleep at night. I’ve just finalised
one of my exam papers and it’s got a
question on it that I didn’t even hint
at in any of the lectures I gave to the
students. They’re all going to fail! My
wife says the stress is making me sweat
more, and she’s refusing to wash all my
shirts on the grounds that they smell
like cheese. How can I warn students of
their impending exam disaster?
Lecturer104
Dear Lecturer104,
Think you’re tired now? Wait until you
reach hell. No, I’m kidding. Relish the
fact that it’s not actually you taking the
exam, and buy some deodorant for the
sweat. You could email every student
individually with some hints. (*Clicks
repeatedly on the refresh email but-
ton.*… please?)
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I can’t stop eating! When I’m revising
the only thing I can think of to do for
a study break is eat… I munch on bis-
cuits and cake and sweets all day. And
crisps. And I like to have a box of Mal-
tesers on the desk so I can nibble when
I’m working. The problem is that I’m
starting to resemble a sumo wrestler
(when viewed from behind) but I just
can’t stop. What’s the best way to lose
revision weight?
ChickenPie
Dear ChickenLickinPie,
I can completely understand your pain;
currently I’m eating for six. (Myself,
and five exams.)
Your main problem is those bastards
who study so much they forget to eat,
as they lose weight during this tough
time and make the rest of us look bad.
As a college we should work together
and pile on the pounds so that no indi-
vidual looks bad.
You could take up smoking, which
I’ve heard both reduces weight gain
and gives you a good reason to take lots
of small breaks, although this probably
isn’t the best time to start as I think
they banned it or something?
