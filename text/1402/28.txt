Imperial never looked so good
Nads Jumabhoy and Daniel Wan scour the crowds of Imperial College looking for those with style
A
sunny Friday after-
noon during exam
time at Imperial, and
every spare space in
the library is taken
up by a stressed-out
student. It’s probably one of the worst
moments to approach someone to ask
them whether they’d like to feature
in this week’s issue of Felix. Strangers
scare me, and ones that look they’ve
been reading obituary pages rather
than revision notes scare me even
more; and hence I didn’t approach any-
one. But the lovely Nads Jumabhoy did;
completely unphased by the task of
talking to people we thought had even
an irk of style in their daily wear.
We seemed to inadvertently ap-
proach more Physicists than anyone
else. We’re not sure whether this is a
correlation between studying Physics
and looking good or not. Wouldn’t that
be a turn for a stereotypist’s book?
Ithoughtwe’dstruggletofind enough
people who we thought deserved to be
commended for what they were wear-
ing that day, but also wouldn’t mind
being featured. However, we were
pleasantly suprised at people’s enthusi-
asm and cooperation in what Nads and
I were trying to achieve.
Rather than shying away from the
camera, many embraced the limelight
they were due to recieve in this issue.

Firstly, we’ll start with the standard dress around
College; and people wonder why we have a
reputation for being geeks. There’s a few odd
people that think it looks cool, even fashionable,
to walk around with their labcoats on. The worst
offenders are the ones that leave their lab coats
open in a ‘just nailed that electrophoresis experi-
ment good’ way. When they turn a corner quickly
their ‘coat tails’ waver majestically in the air, and
you can just tell they’re thinking “How cool am
I?” with a genuine lack of irony.
A prime example featured on the right is PhD
student Archibald, his mates call him Prickface.
He wears his labcoat outside of labs. When I said
he had mates, I lied. Let’s see what ol’ Archie’s
wearing exactly:
Labcoat,
Issued in Fresher’s Week, £15
Shirt,
Primark, £4
Spectacles,
NHS, £90
Petri Dish Accessory,
It doesn’t even matter anymore.
ping expedition around College was
to catch people during their usual day.
You know, lectures, lunch and labs.
(Our days are littered with allitera-
tion!) We weren’t looking for anything
special, but after thousands of issues of
Felix without the very people of Impe-
rial College featured in Felix Fashion,
Nads and I agreed it would be a good
change from another article telling the
latest decline of a supermodel or what
to wear in the new season. If Fashion
features one or two students from Col-
lege, we feel it gives the readers some-
thing else; another reason to pick up
the new issue of Felix on Fridays.
Hopefully, it’ll work. Thousands,
even millions, more people each week
will grab Felix as soon as Tomo (the
Editor) dumps them down in the dis-
trubution bins on Friday mornings, in
the sheer excitement that Felix Fashion
may or may not feature them and their
friends. Or maybe not, but you never
know.
I’d like to know what you think.
Think we should have a similar feature
each week? Got any better ideas you’d
like to see? Email me at daniel.wan07@
imperial.ac.uk.
For now, I’ll leave you with this week’s
fashionable Imperialites we found pot-
tering about College. Maybe it’ll be you
next week. Watch out for Nads with
the notepad and yours truly with the
broken Felix-owned camera.
