Union Colours
Nominations Open
What are Colours?
Colours are a type of award that Imperial
College Union can give to anybody to
recognise the service, contribution and
dedication of someone to the Union.
There are five types of Colours that are
broadly separated into two groups. The first
three Colours, which are Half Colours, Full
Colours and Outstanding Service Awards,
are awarded in recognition of one year’s
service to the Union. The other two Colours,
which are Fellowships and Distinguished
Fellowships, are awarded in recognition of
many year’s service to the Union.
Who can be nominated for Colours?
Anybody can be nominated for these awards,
except the Union Sabbatical Officers and the
Felix Editor.
Who can nominate someone for
Colours?
Any Imperial student can complete a
nomination form, but it’s best not to
nominate yourself!
What happens if you are awarded a
Colours
Being awarded a Colours is a great honour
and privilege. Those who receive these
awards are presented with an award
certificate at a ceremony, a tie or pin, and
in the case of the higher awards a gift
like an engraved tankard or Honorary Life
membership of the Union. The Union keeps a
record of all the people awarded Colours.
What do you need to do to be
awarded a Colour?
To be awarded Half Colours you need to have
made a “positive contribution to the general
life of the Union in an extraordinary fashion.”
To be awarded Full Colours you have
to “repeatedly, through outstanding
achievements, over the course of the year,
have made a significant contribution to the
life of the Union.”
For an Outstanding Service Award “you
will have displayed continuous outstanding
achievement across a broad spectrum of
Union activities.” Few of these are given out,
only five a year at most.
The Fellowship and Distinguished Fellowship
awards are much harder to get as they are
are based on the contribution the awardee
has made over a length of time.

To receive a Union Fellowship award you
need to “have continuously served the Union
in an exceptional manner.” Very few of these
are given out.
To receive a Distinguished Fellowship
you need to have “served the Union in a
selfless and dedicated manner which is both
exceptional and beyond reproach.”
If you don’t know which award to nominate
someone for then choose the one you feel is

change if necessary.
