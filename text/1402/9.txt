New President
Russia
Wednesday 7th of May saw the inauguration of Dmitry
Medvedev as Russia’s President. In his first public speech
after the appointment, Medvedev declared his intention
to ‘pay special attention to the fundamental role of the
law’, eliminate corruption and improve living conditions
for the Russian people. The true power, however, is
expected to follow ex-President Vladimir Putin to his
new role as Prime Minister.
Cyclone Nargis
Burma
What is feared to be the world’s deadliest cyclone since
1991struckBurmaonMay2nd,leavingover5,000square
kilometres underwater. The exact number of casualties
is obviously difficult to confirm, but predictions are
currently as high as 50,000. International aid has started
coming in, with leaders such as Gordon Brown vowing to
make sure ‘food aid is available to the people of Burma’.
Fears of Famine
North Korea
Severe flooding in 2007 has led to what the Voice of
America calls ‘a desperate food shortage’ in North Korea.
The UN World Food Programme has calculated a grain
deficit of two million tons, predicting that there will not
be enough to meet the citizens’ basic needs. The food
crisis in North Korea is one of several such incidents
being reported this year, with similar food shortages
surfacing in Southeast Asia, Africa and Australia
Troops go home
Iraq
Close to 3,500 American troops are due to return home over
the next few weeks, in an attempt to reduce the number of
troops serving in Iraq. The US government plans to go from
170,000 men and women there at present to 140,000 come
late July. This figure will mean a similar total force in Iraq
as was present before President Bush’s ‘surge’ last year. The
planned withdrawal comes amid an increase in the number
of attacks over recent weeks, though casualty figures seem to
be consistent with official figures.
