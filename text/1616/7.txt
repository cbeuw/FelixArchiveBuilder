Bond leaves feminists shaken not stirred
Everything else has been brought into the
present, but the portrayal of women is stuck in
the past
Tessa Davey

L
ast week, along with half
the country, I decided
to brave the crowded
cinemas to see the newest
James Bond film,Spectre.Some have
described Spectre as gratuitous, but
I thought that it was fantastic, both
in terms of the cinematography, and
the primal enjoyment in watching
people get beaten to a pulp. But
despite enjoying it,I came out of the
cinema with a slightly bitter taste in
my mouth.
The writers, directors, and
producers of the modern, Daniel
Craig incarnations of James Bond
have obviously tried to make their
films progressive, and to bring them
in line with the modern world. And
for the most part, they’ve succeeded.
Moneypenny is now a young, hot,
black woman with a life outside
MI6, and Q is an Imperial-worthy
geek who always ends up saving
the day by hacking some computer
system.
Within the genre of a renegade
spy who somehow faces no
consequences for disobeying orders
and can make himself invisible
to all intelligence agencies just by
driving a highly conspicuous car
across Europe, the film does a pretty
decent job of re-styling it for the
modern era. But where it fails is in
its portrayal of women.
Female characters appear, and
often start off being presented as
strong, well-rounded, independent
women who don’t want or need
any help from James Bond. But
invariably, three scenes later, the
sexual tension has built (or appears
out of nowhere in a rather contrived
way) and we see them tumble into
bed, followed by some fight scene
where he displays his apparently
irresistible masculinity.
That’s fine, he’s hot, it’s a sexy
situation, I get it. But after sleeping
with him, these female characters
seem devoid of any personality and
merely follow him around like a
helpless puppy,occasionally needing
saving.What is it about James Bond
that does this? Does he have some
kind of sexually transmitted disease
that only affects women, attacking
their frontal lobes?
Does James
Bond have
some sort
of sexually
transmitted
disease that
only affects
women?
These days, it’s not appropriate
to reduce women from supporting
characters to decoration after they
have been explicitly sexualised.
Writing these characters as
subservient, helpless and timid after
they have served their duty being a
piece of ass is no longer acceptable.
Every other aspect of the film has
been carefully scrutinised and
updated to make it realistic and
relevant for today, but by leaving in
this dated portrayal of women, the
writers are demonstrating a latent
sexist attitude. They are showing
that they only consider women’s
personalities to be a means of
justifying their being interesting
enough for Bond to shag them, not
worth bothering with once he’s got
his leg over.
Many people will speak in defence
of this, arguing that Bond being a
womaniser is an important part of
the genre, and to some extent, I
agree. I have no problem with James
Bond having sex with as many of
the female (or male) characters as
he desires. But sleeping with James
Bond and being a powerful female
character are not mutually exclusive,
and I think that it is time that the
producers address their misogynistic
attitudes and truly bring James
Bond into the modern era.
Poppies are not a source of pride
By wearing a poppy, all you are showing is that you can conform to what is expected

November marks
97 years since the
armistice of the
First World War. Across the UK,
the poppy will be worn this month
as a symbol of commemoration
for all the lives lost and affected by
conflict.
Every year the appeal is criticised
for seeming to glorify war: the
parade by the Royal British Legion
can be seen to present wars as a
justifiable necessity full of grandeur
and pride – a bloody means to an
end. The Festival of Remembrance
takes place over the weekend at
the Royal Albert Hall, including
poppy-adorned performances by
Pixie Lott and Rod Stewart.
Another criticism is that poppies
have lost their meaning. The
expectation for them to be worn
in public is so strong that there
were complaints when Channel 4
presenter, Jon Snow, chose not to
wear one on air. Poppies are flown
out to correspondents all over the
world so that no news screen should
lack the red paper badge.This week,
the Conservative party was mocked
for photoshopping a poppy onto
David Cameron’s lapel for his new
Facebook profile picture. If they
have become such a requirement
this time of year that photos must
be corrected to display them, do
they mean anything but conforming
to what is expected? What do they
mean besides a reflection of the
calendar month? Nothing but a
deferential “respect our troops”?
For me,poppies are a symbol of the
harsh realities of war.The jarring red
symbolises the blood of those on any
“side” that died, and are still dying
in combat. The money raised by the
poppy appeal goes to support past
and present soldiers and their loved
ones, whose wounds are mental as
well as physical. For those affected
by war, I think the respectful thing
to do is to take a step back, and have
a moment of silence to acknowledge
the atrocities experienced by fellow
human beings. The poppy reminds
us that the real cost of war is not
paid by nations, but by ordinary
individuals.It is not about glorifying
any “victory”, but about the loss
that happened, and is happening.
It is important to remember so that
we can make a conscious effort to
support those who are subjected
to such horrors. The poppy is a
sobering, not beautiful sight.
I will be wearing a poppy, but I
won’t be wearing it with pride.

Turkey: water cannons, bombs, and elections
Watching events in your country unfold from across the border is never easy
Anonymous

hen talking about
how it feels to
live abroad, the
conversation tends
to revolve around the things you
miss, such as family members, the
weather, or food. But, if your home
country is in a state of change and
turmoil, the hardest thing about
being away is having to live through
certain events merely through the
news,brought to you predominantly
by social media.
This article is not about the politics
behind Turkey’s turmoil, but rather
it is about the sentimental side of
having to experience this turmoil
from a distance.
Two and a half years ago I was
glued to my computer screen in the
library, clicking on link after link
on Facebook, watching the Gezi
Park demonstrations in Istanbul.
As I watched the videos of the
Turkish police trying to overpower
the citizens through the brutal use
of water cannons and tear gas I felt
devastated, furious, and worst of all,
helpless.
Three weeks ago I woke up to my
Facebook news feed telling me that
two bombs had gone off in my home
city – Ankara,the capital ofTurkey.I
instantly called my parents to check
on my family, and words cannot
express the emotions I experienced
as I waited for them to pick up. My
family and friends were okay, but
throughout the day I watched the
number of families who weren’t as
lucky rise to over 130.
Sunday marked the second time
in five months that Turkey had
parliamentary elections; the first
one, in June, was inconclusive, as
the rival parties could not agree on
forming a coalition.
I was at my desk working,with my
computer screen locked on a live feed
of the election results. Watching the
results without family and friends
was a whole new experience –
without the heated discussions and
You’d
think that
anything that
significantly
raises
cancer risk
would be a
concern
educated speculations about what
the results would bring for Turkey’s
future, the vote counts felt nothing
more than meaningless numbers.
Now, it seems that I will have
many more sleepless nights as
Turkey’s instability continues, and I
pursue my life abroad.Yet,I am only
one of many international students
having to helplessly watch our
home country’s fate from across the
world. Some people can distance
themselves from the sentiments
brought on by such events. Others
have different coping mechanisms,
be it reading every post on social
media, or incessantly telling friends
what their perspective is on the
politics behind the events.
To end with the words of Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the
Republic of Turkey, “Peace at home,
Peace in the World.” And so I hope
that one day in the future I can say
that Turkey too has joined some of
the few countries in the world to
have found (relative) peace.
Should we accept that bacon gives us cancer?
The writing is on the wall when it comes to the
benefits of vegetarianism
Ben Sharpless
Writer
F
irst you find out you’re not
actually eating beef, nay,
horses. Then you find out
it causes cancer too. Hard
times to be a meat eater.
It has been in the news that the
WHO have produced a report
telling us that meat causes cancer.
Or rather, they have classified
certain types of meat as a Group 1
carcinogen.
Headlines such as, “Meat as big
a cause of cancer as cigarettes” and
“Meat as bad as tobacco”, however,
are the media getting up to its clever,
sensationalist, attention-grabbing
tricks. The headlines stem from
the fact that processed meats have
been put into the same carcinogen
category as tobacco. But whereas
tobacco raises the relative risk of
cancer by about 250%, eating two
slices of bacon a day only raises your
relative risk by 18%. So it isn’t quite
as bad as the papers would have us
believe.
But what still baffles me is people’s
attitude toward the study. Instead of
concern, people seem to scoff at it,
as if the idea that meat is that bad
for their health is ridiculous. Why
is that? You’d think that anything
that significantly raises cancer risk
would be a concern, but there seems
to be a prejudice against anything
that challenges eating meat in the
general population.
It might be that people’s attitudes
towards vegetarianism and meat
are rooted in old ways of thinking,
where finishing a steak was the
mark of a man. Personally, there
have been many times that people
have made a remark that I’m less
manly for not eating meat. I’ve also
heard that I “just graze in a field”
when I’m hungry.
Vegetarians are often criticised for
not eating meat, even though the
person criticising is not affected by
their decision in any way.
If a study was released saying that
fruit significantly increased the risk
of cancer, would people take more
notice?
Until the early-mid twentieth
century, smoking was seen as less of
a taboo. Some people even believed
that tobacco was good for them
(because of the propaganda of the
tobacco industry). But smoking has
declined drastically since then, due
to large shifts in the public views of
the way tobacco affects health, and
in particular causes cancer.
The health merits of a vegetarian
diet have been extensively
documented, and the writing has
been on the wall for a long time
in terms of meat’s carcinogen
capacity. So, is it time for people to
get over their meat prejudices and
start looking at how it affects their
health, in the same way they look at
tobacco? Probably not – I think the
study will be forgotten about pretty
quickly.
