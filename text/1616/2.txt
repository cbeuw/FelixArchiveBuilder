THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

n the aftermath of our music
editor’s rant on political
apathy at Imperial last week, I
was intrigued. Were we always
like this? Did Imperial students ever
get really involved in causes beyond
our graduate prospects?
So I looked back in the archives,
which are handily bound in leather
and line the walls of the FELIX
office, to see when the political
dissidence ended, or if it was ever
there in the first place.
I stumbled across some sad things,
especially in light of Wednesday’s
fees and cuts demo. 2010 was a big
year for student protests. Clegg had
just broken the Lib Dem promise
to scrap tuition fees, which would
eventually see his demise from
politics completely. FELIX had
reported on the big shouty protests.
We took pictures. There was a small
fire. We took a picture of that too.
Someone threw a fire extinguisher
off a building (not us though). It
was all very exciting.
Our very own union even took a
standpoint on the matter.The union
council, voted in to represent the
voices of Imperial students, voted to
support the Browne review.

fees cap for home students should
be completely removed.Completely.
Removed. This didn’t happen in
the end, obviously. Fees for home
students at the moment are capped
at a shocking nine grand, an
unimaginable sum for those at the
time, who were paying only £3,375
per year, tops.
Ours was one of the very few
unions not to officially reject
the fee hike, but in addition, our
‘representative’body decided to back
a slightly more draconian policy
than even the coalition government
could stomach. Seriously.
But it wasn’t all doom and gloom.
Back in 2007, the RCSU had
been promised a new office on
the walkway. College Estates then
backtracked, leaving them with
barely a broom cupboard to operate
from. In protest, the committee
created a makeshift office on
Dalby Court in front of the Faculty
Building (that’s the Blue Cube to
you and I), complete with a desk,
computer and sofa. They got their
space on the Sherfield walkway in
the end.This shit can work, guys!
In 2010, the union attempted to
scupper plans for a life sciences re-
structure that would see fourteen
staff made redundant. When a
union council paper called for
the re-structure to be halted, 160
students gathered to protest outside
the College Senate meeting to
decide on the department’s fate.
Students wore masks and chanted,
“Save our plants!”
The paper was rejected, and the
department lost staff. Disappointed
students threatened to get back at
the university by writing damning
National Student Satisfaction
Survey entries. Not quite the
OCCUPY movement, but an
Imperial protest if ever there was
one.

Letters (kinda)
In response to ‘My period is not a
luxury’, Issue 1615
I would like to remind all members
of the Imperial College community
– both students and staff – that the
Union’s Shop Extra on Sherfield
Walkway has committed to selling
feminine hygiene products ‘at cost’
since March. This was following a
paper I presented to Union Council
last year which gained the support
of the student body and the shop
management.
This offers women at Imperial a
significantly greater discount on
feminine hygiene products than the
removal of the 5% VAT rate. I’m
very proud to have played my part
– and I just wish that the decision
to remove VAT could be taken at
Parliamentary level and not require
unanimous agreement between 28
countries at European level. That is
not democracy.
Shop Extra on Sherfield Walkway
is open Monday - Friday from 08:30
until 18:00.
Chris Kaye, the union’s Deputy
President of Finance and Services
(via email)
Thanks for that Chris,any excuse
to advertise, eh? In fairness, this
is probably the most productive
thing that has ever happened at
union council. Well done man,
this and the pizza bases, what
haven’t you given the Imperial
students? Couldn’t save the tree,
though, could you?

In response to ‘I went to the Bond
premiere’, Issue 1615
All I took from this was “smug
Sabb takes advantage of elected role,
then writes about how smug she is.”
‘Not impresses [sic]’ (online)
Steady on there, ‘Not impresses’.
I wasn’t in the staff ballot for the
tickets,andI’mnoteventhisbitter.
-Ed.
Are you gunna report on this?
Dude who brought part of Beit
quad tree’s trunk, which had been
chopped down by the union, into the
FELIX office (in person)
Yes.
-Ed.
In response to ‘Why are Imperial
students so apathetic about
politics?’, Issue 1615
While you raise the point of
Union Council, do ask yourself the
question – is Council really that
representative of the students it is
supposed to represent?
I personally found in previous
years that Council has actually been
more interested in the ideologies
of the people in it, rather than of
myself and my peers.
I guess its hard when you vote for
the funny manifesto rather than any
concrete policies – when I voted I
always found all the manifestos
to say the same thing (“power to
students”) instead of anything
concrete with the exception of
Andrew Tranter who I think
deserves a huge amount of credit
irrespective of whether you agree
with his point of view or not!
Hopefully this democracy review
I read about will fix it – maybe
Council will be more successful
at lobbying when it has a stronger
mandate from the student body to
campaign on issues it cares about?
‘Ex-student’ (online)
Andrew, is that you? Can’t help
but agree with you on the council
thing. I went to my first the other
day. As a non-member, at one
point I tried to ask a question,
and my right to do even that was
questioned. At one point we
took a vote about whether or not
we should write down how each
person voted on each motion. It’s
hack-y, pinickity, and aggressive,
but if a standard cross-section of
students don’t turn up, what’s the
alternative? Should we just have
referendums for everything, like
that dude who ran to be an MP
and said he would use Facebook
polls to decide how to vote in
parliament?
-Ed.
