W
ednesday saw
10,000 students,
including several
from Imperial,
march for free education. The
protest was organised by the
National Campaign Against Fees
and Cuts. Kieran Ryan (pictured)
organised the Imperial bloc, which
included the union’s elected Deputy
President of Welfare and campaigns
officer.
The demo was generally a peaceful
affair. Shadow Chancellor John
McDonnell made a speech to
protesters, saying the government
had “betrayed” them by upping
fees and scrapping grants, and that
higher education was “a gift from
one generation to another”.

Jeremy hunts for a solution to junior doctor drama
H
ealth Secretary Jeremy
Hunt has offered junior
doctors an 11% basic
pay rise. In an attempt
to convince junior doctors not to
take strike action, he’s conveying
the message via a letter to be sent to
all 50,000 junior doctors in England
via their medical schools.
The letter has also been published
in full online, and contains what
Hunt describes as “assurances for
junior doctors about our approach
to a new contract.”
In the letter, he insists that the
proposed contract changes are “not a
cost cutting exercise”, with changes
in the pay for junior doctors being
designed as “cost neutral, rather
than cost saving.”
He also reiterates that he perceives
these changes as being required
to deliver “a seven day NHS”, and
that they will help “underpin… the
NHS [as] the safest health care
system in the world [by] reducing,
not increasing, the number of hours
junior doctors work each week.”
The letter comes in response to
the British Medical Association
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
walking out of talks over the
contract, saying that ministers had
made “misleading” claims about the
nature of the “unsafe and unfair”
contract changes, and that the
11% pay rise promised by Hunt
(although not mentioned in the
letter) was offset by other changes,
including alterations to unsociable
hours payments.
The proposed reclassification of
sociable hours had been 07:00 to
22:00, Monday to Saturday. Hunt’s
letter states that Saturday hours
have now been reduced to 07:00 to
19:00.
At the moment the entire
weekend is classified as unsociable,
and therefore junior doctors get
paid more for working these hours.
The new contracts would cut the
amount of time classed as unsociable
by 25%.
The BMA is balloting its members
over whether they wish to take
industrial action.Opening yesterday,
the vote lasts for two weeks, and if
action is approved will lead to the
first such walkout since the 1970s.
Hunt hopes his last-minute letter
will convince the BMA to come
back to the negotiating table,but his
continued framing of the contract
debate as one over pay rather than
safety (as the BMA repeatedly
points out it is) may yet come back
to haunt him.
