t has become cliché that while
“all happy families are alike;
eachunhappyfamilyisunhappy
in its own way”. Husbands and
Sons, an adaption of three of DH
Lawrence’s lesser-known plays,
engagingly depicts the persistent,
mundane horror overshadowing
the lives of three mining families in
early 20th
century Nottinghamshire.
The mines are an ever-present
spectre, threatening the livelihoods
and indeed lives of the miners.
Soot infiltrates every aspect of
family life.The parallels between the
men’s claustrophobic entrapment
in the pits and that of their
wives in cramped kitchens are
immediately apparent. Conflict
between husbands and wives, wives
and mothers, fathers and sons is
omnipresent. Thin walls transmit
neighbours’arguments,robbing even
temporarily reconciled households
of peace. The innovative use of a
minimalist set focuses attention
upon this unfolding human
drama. The industrial revolution’s
desolation of bucolic life is depicted
with an authenticity born of
Lawrence’s personal experience.
Misery emanates not only from
the mines, but also from frequently
toxic family dynamics.
Distant, often brutish, husbands
conflict with their seemingly
indifferent wives. Mothers bereft
of affection from their husbands
seek to control the affections of
sons seeking to form relationships
with wives of their own. Sons fight
to escape their fathers’ legacies,
projecting struggles against their
inherited nature onto their parents.
All are isolated in the midst of a
densely packed community.
While the tribulations of the first
act induce a heavy and oppressive
atmosphere, the interpersonal
origin of many of the characters’
problems permits a redemption
that would remain out of reach
should they stem solely from
the seemingly inescapable coal
pits. In this Lawrence offers the
audience a thin ray of light amidst
the darkness. Husbands and Sons is
both an authentic period piece and

Mothers, marraiges and mines oppress and inspire in gripping production at the National
instantly relatable to the present
day. With the recent closure of
Tata’s steel plants, the social impact
of the decline of heavy industry
has once again been brought into
sharp focus. Lawrence refrains from
romanticism in his depiction of the
lives of mining communities, but in
portraying the humour, camaraderie
and resilience of these unbowed
husbands, wives, mothers and sons
he reveals a telling dichotomy. The
closure of the pits ended the danger
faced on a daily basis by the miners,
but also decimated communities
with distinct identities and a
solidarity born of resisting forces
beyond their control.
A universally strong cast makes
Husbands and Sons a thoroughly
immersive experience. The events
of the play are seen through the
eyes of its female characters. In
a stand out performance, Anne
Marie-Duff’s heart-breaking
conflict between duty to her family
and to herself culminates in a
dramatic crux that sheds light on
her inability to escape her situation.
Louise Brearley is entirely
convincing as a beautiful and loving
wife trapped in a vicious cycle of
recrimination that threatens to
drive a progressively greater wedge
between her and her husband.
Both express their affection for the
other, but never to the other. The
isolation and emotional repression
hinted at through innumerable
subtleties in her performance
communicates her inner turmoil
without uttering a single word.
Just as the mines remain constantly
present in the characters’ lives, even
after they have washed themselves
clean of soot, the struggles and
resilience of Lawrence’s characters
will remain with the audience
long after the final curtain.

Oh your crimson heart,
which bleeds its throbbing red,
into the cavity of an aching chest,
and in doing so
revives an old ennui,
which heaves and splutters
coughing up the congestions of a past pernicious;
arteries bulge with viscous stuff,
veins tear and capillaries explode,
and in a cacophony of silence the insides implode,
a great statue felled by compunction
its uneven foundations now clear to see,
a rubble of human belonging.

Escher: Psychedelic Mathematics, Scientific Art
T
he paradoxical works
of MC Escher were
paradoxically admired
both by intellectuals for
their mathematical accuracy, and
by Pop culture’s hippie movement
for their otherworldly creations.
The Amazing World of MC Escher at
Dulwich Picture Gallery thoroughly
explores the whole body of Escher’s
works and through this exploration
provides a portrait of the incredible,
peculiar, and enigmatic persona of
Escher himself.
This exhibition gives the audience
not only the opportunity to
admire Escher’s most famed and
characteristic works in the flesh,
but also to discover his early, less-
known works.

The chorological arrangement
of the works allows the audience
experience Escher’s personal journey
and artistic transition from realistic
landscapes to multiple perspective
worlds of his own creation. It
is curious to see the varieties of
influences and techniques Escher
tried out before finding his niche,
and moreover even when he had
found his artistic vision, he never
stopped perfecting, reworking his
art, continuously exploring different
techniques, methods, and subjects
throughout all of his career and well
into his late works.
The early works of Escher in the
first rooms of the gallery are mostly
landscapes and realistic subjects
such as portraits, but even these
already show Escher’s interest in
peculiar and slightly augmented
perspectives and an attention to
minute detail. The audience then
experiences Escher’s transition to
inventing his subjects and images.
The second room shows what
Escher called the start of his
‘Mental Imagery period’ – the first
works where he combines two-
dimentional and three-dimentional
images in one plane, as well as
the first of his famous double and
reflected imagery (as seen in Hand
with Reflecting Sphere displayed in
this room).This is also when Escher
begins producing tessellation prints,
like Metamorphosis 1 where a 3D
town transforms into a 2D figure,
or Day and Night where black and
white birds fly out from the middle
of the plane with the black birds
emerging from the spaces between
the white birds and vice versa.
Following this period is one where
Escher moves away from tessellation
prints to concentrate on paradoxes
demonstrating the illusion of art.
Escher was a perfectionist – he
would make several studies and
sketches, and would even rework
a print numerous times. Several
of Escher’s studies and sketches
for his famous works are also
exhibited, showing his meticulous
creative process which was not a
spontaneous art, but a methodical
science. His attention to detail
allowed him to create completely
irrational and impossible and yet
perfectly fluid and coherent worlds
in his prints, worlds where different
perspectives and different points
of gravity ran into each other so
naturally that it isn’t apparent that
they are contradictory.
This continuous theme of the
real and reflected, the harmonious
interplay of art and illusion and a
new reality run throughout all of
Escher’sworks,andhisuniqueability
to create these new coherent worlds
made him popular in the 1950’s
throughout Europe and America,
and his fans ranged from intellectual
groups of mathematicians to pop
culture legends. Seeing the full body
of Escher’s extensive works in this
exhibition, it is clear that Escher’s
fame was not due to a cultural
movement or a phenomenon of luck,
but solely due to the recognition
and appreciation of his hard work
and true genius.
Escher, however, shunned fame
and only strived to find peace and
quiet to concentrate on his work,
which is probably why, although
most people have seen his works
in numerous places, they are not as

familiar with the name behind the
works, as they may be with Picasso
or Dali or Monet.
Through his meticulous process
and finished works, it seems that
Escher aimed to find order in a
world of chaos. For him, “order was
the conclusion” as he said, referring
to Contrast (Order and Chaos), one
of his late works. This notion helps
us to understand Escher’s works
from a personal point of view.
There is a striking late work in
the last gallery, Liberation, where
a pattern of 2D birds transforms
into 3D birds at the top, flying off
to freedom. This work is almost a
metaphor for Escher’s own personal
liberation from his struggles amidst
life’s chaos, achieved only through
the perfect order of patterns he
created himself.
Though the artist and his art
remain enigmas, it is all the
more captivating to explore
the possibilities of Escher’s
unconventionally beautiful and
eccentric works in the Dulwich
Picture Gallery.
The Amazing World of MC Escher
is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery
until 17th
January 2016.
