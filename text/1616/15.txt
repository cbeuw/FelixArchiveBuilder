FILM
A
ny piece on the work
of Iranian director Jafar
Panahi cannot really
start anywhere else than
on the 20th
December 2010, the day
Panahi was convicted for ‘assembly
and colluding with the intention
to commit crimes against [Iran’s]
national security’. The conviction,
which was in direct response to his
films – described by the Iranian
government as ‘propaganda’ – has
left Panahi with a 20-year ban on
directing. Keen readers may have
noticed that since then a number
of films have come out bearing his
name: This Is Not a Film in 2011;
Closed Curtain in 2013; and now
Taxi Tehran, an uplifting, beautiful
work which ranks among Panahi’s
best.
Taxi Tehran continues in the vein
of Panahi’s previous works. Rather
than stop making films, he seems
to have begun twisting the very
definition of cinema itself. This Is
Not a Film, as the title may suggest,
critiqued the very institution and
process that is film-making. It
features Pahani reading scenes
aloud from the movie he would
have made. Closed Curtain, a much
more complex tale, features the
breakdown between fact and fiction,
as Pahani makes a rogue appearance
into the fictitious narrative as
himself. In Taxi Tehran, Pahani gets
behind the wheels of a taxi,taking to
the streets of Tehran to ferry around
an array of characters. Filmed in
real time, the film poses a number
of questions about what is real and
what is fake.It is possible that all the
passengers were actors; or perhaps
only some were in on the game, the
rest being unwitting bystanders.The
lack of a proper set of credits, done
presumably to protect the identity
of those involved in the film, only
deepens the confusion – the only
character we know by name is
Pahani’s niece Hana, who picked up
the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film
Festival on behalf of her uncle, who
is forbidden to leave the country.
Like all of Panahi’s films, Taxi
Tehran takes a roundabout way of
critiquing Iranian society, placing
the forbidden opinions into the
mouths of the Iranians themselves.
There’s the argument between
passengers about whether thieves
should be executed for their
crimes, which ends up taking on
a comic turn; there’s the woman
whose husband has gotten into an
accident which, if proving fatal,
will leave her destitute since women
cannot inherit property; and there’s
the human rights lawyer Nasrin
Sotoudeh, persecuted for going
against the regime, who discusses
with Panahi the very-real case
of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a SOAS
graduate imprisoned for protesting
in favour of equal access to sporting
events.
These are all real issues, whether
those discussing them are fictitious
or not, but the real core of the
film lies in the time Panahi gives
to explore the issue of filmmaking
within Iran. One of the most
interesting characters within the
film is the bootleg DVD seller
whom Pahani ferries around as
he makes sales of Kurosawa films.
There is little doubt that a number
of the films he carries have been
banned – an idea reinforced by the
CD seller who approaches the car
hawking prohibited music – and
his repertoire probably includes a
number of Panahi’s films. Certainly,

The sheer
joy of
filmmaking
shines
through
Panahi’s
lens
Jafar Panahi is a rebel with a cause
Taxi Tehran is a defiant, bold work which runs circles around the censors
the seller has no problem in
recognizing Panahi, despite his
incongruous position in the front of
the taxi cab.
The bootlegger is also probably
the only way people within Iran can
see Panahi’s films, which have been
banned.Putting him in the same car
as Pahani is a stroke of genius, an
ironic twist of the knife that is both
humorous and crushing. Similarly,
Pahani’s niece Hana, an aspiring
filmmaker herself, takes time to
explain rules that accompany her
school project to make a short
film: no ties, no men and women
conversing, and no ‘sordid realism’.
When she asks what such a claim
means – indeed, such an idea only
reinforces the claim most children
have that all adults are mad, stupid,
or both – Pahani explains, with
a smile, that she would not be
allowed to include footage of what
his passengers have said against
the regime, footage that has been
captured by his three hidden
cameras.
Such messages may seem to
portray Taxi Tehran as a film that is
bleak, if not depressing – this could
not be further from the truth.While
Pahani’s situation in Iran is indeed
dire, the sheer joy of filmmaking
shines through the lens. Indeed,
we start the film with a long shot
from the front window of the car as
Pahani drives through the streets of
his beloved Tehran; as the camera
moves along the roads, taking in a
view of the capital that seems so far
removed from the image television
series such as Homeland enforce in
our minds, we can sense the pure
energy,the joie-de-vivre that Pahani
obtains from filmmaking.
Political without being pushy,
serious without being dour, Taxi
Tehran deserves to rank among
the best of Pahani’s work, and – by
extension – is probably one of the
best Iranian films of recent times.
The film ends on an ambiguous note
as masked men break into the car –
whether to steal it or to destroy the
recording equipment is unknown.
This alone is not enough to sully
the impression the film leaves on
its audience, one that can best be
summed up in the image of Pahani’s
wry smile in the face of extreme
oppression.
Taxi Tehran is out now on limited
release.
Taxi Tehran
Dir: Jafar Panahi. Script: Jafar
Panahi.Starring: Jafar Panahi,Hana
Saeidi. 82 minutes.
Documentary corner: Jiro Dreams of Sushi
Ben Collier
Film Writer
F
ound in a subway station
of downtown Tokyo and
seating only a mere ten
people, it’s fair to say
Sukiyabashi Jiro is one of the more
inconspicuous three-Michelin-
starred restaurants in the world.
Since expanding their gaze to the
Far East, the Michelin guide has
become enchanted by the food
of Japan, which now boasts more
three-starred restaurants than any
other country – but there is only
one sushi restaurant on this list. Jiro
Dreams of Sushi tells the story of the
restaurant’s owner, oft-touted ‘best
sushi chef in the world’, Jiro Ono,
and his quest to perfect the art of
sushi making. For all the build-up
Jiro gets in this film, however, we
eventually find out that the head
chef duties actually belong to Jiro’s
eldest son and heir, Yoshikazu.
Herein lies the depth of the film.
The complexities of this father-
son relationship is a major theme
explored by director David Gelb;
questions are raised over whether
Yoshikazu is good enough to take
over and whether he even wants
to do so. Yoshikazu’s working life
really just appears to be the result
of obligation based on traditional
Japanese ideas of succession and
responsibility. It seems that, despite
the title, the real story told here – in
the words of the director himself –
is one of a man “living in his father’s
shadow”.
The film goes even deeper than
this. Much like Gelb’s Netflix series
Chef ’s Table, Jiro Dreams of Sushi is
focused on documenting the chef’s
personal philosophies. For Jiro, the
end goal of his work is not success,
but rather the pride of knowing he
has achieved perfection. Perfection
of one’s craft, he claims, is what
leads one to a fulfilled life.
This is an idea not many can
empathise with, and it seems
like Jiro’s work ethic is what
has ultimately cost him what is
traditionally important in life:
family, recreation, and enjoying
one’s success. Interestingly enough,
Jiro isn’t alone in this obsession – he
is surrounded by very like-minded
people. This allows the director to
comment on Japanese perfectionist
attitudes as a whole. For example,
a hidden star of this film is Jiro’s
tuna supplier who will pack up and
go home if he fails to win the fish
he wanted that day simply because
“there can only be one best fish”.
One of Jiro’s junior chefs, we are
told, has spent five years cooking
rice, banned from any responsibility
until Jiro believes he has perfected
the task.
On a more superficial note, the
film can be enjoyed as what is
essentially feature-length ‘food
porn’. The gorgeous shots of the
restaurant’s tasting menu overlaid
by an orchestral score by Phillip
Glass is nothing short of beautiful.
Quiet and tender for minutes at a
time, we are treated to gorgeous,
artistic cinematography which truly
helps the viewer understand Jiro’s
love of food. Ultimately, this film
is not an easy celebration of sushi
and the joy it brings to many, but a
complex exploration of what it takes
to be the world’s best.

Fresh Dressed
Dir: Sasha Jenkins. Writer: Sasha
Jenkins. Starring: Nas, Pharrell
Williams, Kanye West, Damon
Dash. 90 minutes.
L
ong before Will Smith
hit the streets of Bel-Air,
the term ‘fresh’ was used
as a compliment. Sacha
Jenkins’ new film, Fresh Dressed,
takes the word as a starting point,
using it to explore the fascinating
influence of hip-hop on fashion,
a relationship that has defined the
clothing world for the last 30 years.
While the term ‘fresh’ has only
been around since the 1980s,Jenkins
looks at the history of African-
American culture.The talking heads
Jenkins gets in do a good job at
describing how, when an oppressed
minority group is constantly told
they are sub-par, they will find their
own validation, often in the form of
clothing.
In the 1970s, for young people
of ethnic minorities, this often
meant buying into aspirational
brands like Gucci. Where Fresh
Dressed really takes off, however,
is in the exploration of the boom
of independent black designers
in the 1980s, working within the
community, for the community.
Interviews with Kanye West, Nas,
and Pharrell Williams highlight
the importance clothing brands like
Karl Kani played in shaping the
public image of musicians like TLC
and Tupac Shakur.
Unfortunately, with every boom
comes a bust, and today there has
been a move back to designers,
with A$AP Rocky more likely
to be rapping about Maison
Margiela than Crossed Colours.
Jenkins’ theory that the increased
expressionism in clothing is tied
to an increasing acceptance of
LGBT+ people is interesting, but is
not elaborated upon. Similarly, the
creative new brands mining street-
wear for inspiration, such as Gosha
Rubchinskiy, Nasir Mazhar, or
Cottweiler, are glossed over. Since
the topic of the film could easily
cover multiple PhD theses, this is
an unsurprising concession.

Do I Sound Gay?
Dir: David Thorpe. Writers: David
Thorpe, Maeve O’Boyle. Starring:
Margaret Cho,George Takei,David
Sedaris. 78 minutes.
D
ocumentarian David
Thorpe takes himself
as the basis of his film,
Do I Sound Gay?, an
exploration of the stereotypical ‘gay
voice’. Following the dissolution
of his long-term relationship, his
confidence is knocked, in particular
regarding his voice, which he
identifies as nasal, feminine, and
similar to the culturally-ingrained
idea of a ‘gay voice’. From this
point onwards, the film looks at
speech therapy, the views on the
‘gay voice’around the world,and the
nature of internalised homophobia.
Interviews with George Takei and
David Sedaris offer an insight into
the relationships gay men have
with their voices; sadly, Thorpe
seems to be fixated on the idea that
relationships – and particularly
marriage – can offer those at odds
with their voices solace. At these
points, the film is arguably least
interesting, which is a pity since
there are some particularly revealing
sections, such as the film theorist
who tracks the development of the
‘pansy’ archetype in mainstream
media. Ultimately, the film tries to
explore too many different fields:
social science, psychoanalysis,
linguistic theory and media studies.
With a run-time of 78 minutes,
perhaps it would work better as a
series, where Thorpe would be able
to properly tackle his subjects.
