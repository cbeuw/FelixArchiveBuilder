University ‘not such a’ Challenge
I
mperial College London’s
University Challenge team
has made another strong
appearance on the BBC quiz
show, winning their second round
match against Sidney Sussex
College Cambridge with a final
score of 305 to 75.
Three physics students are on
this year’s team; captain James
Bezer (a previous FELIX Science
Editor) is joined by Ben Fernando
and Ashwin Braude, alongside
Mathematical Statistics PhD
student Onur Teymur.
James and Ben were spotted by
FELIX reporters attending the
viewing party in FiveSixEight,
where hundreds of students packed
into the bar to cheer and boo along
with the show – and of course see
how many questions they were able
to answer themselves.
This was the 17th
episode of the
overall 2015/16 series and the first
of the second round of the knockout
tournament to air. The Imperial
team were previously featured in
episode ten, where they thrashed
a team from the University of
Reading.
In this previous appearance
Imperial earned the highest score
of any team competing in the first
round, 285 points. Time will tell
whether any teams will manage to
beat their new high score of 305
as the other seven matches of the
second round have yet to air.
As in the first round, the team
put in a strong performance on the

many scientific questions. However
they found their Achilles heel in
classical music,not managing any of
the bonuses and mixing up Gilbert
with Sullivan.
Quick on the buzzer, Imperial
also successfully answered bonuses
on the decades in which certain
US states joined the union, nettles
in Shakespeare (seriously, question
writers?) and sheep breeds.
Thanks to one member of the
opposing team’s shocking hairstyle
and Imperial’s 200+ point lead,social
media and news sites went wild for
the quiz show. The Independent
and Metro websites both published
articles about the episode.
Team captain James Bezer proved
particularly popular with the press
and fans of the show, earning the
nickname ‘Bezer the Geezer’ and
being declared unofficial Man
of the Match by many. Bezer
personally answered 8 of the team’s
16 starters, earning declarations of
love and comments such as “even
the voiceover guy is sick of Bezer
answering everything”.
Imperial haven’t won the show
since 2001; this is the first team to
make it onto the televised portion
of the series since 2012/13, when
we were eliminated in the quarter-
finals. Over 100 students took
part in the internal team selection
process earlier this year. Winners of
the quiz show get bragging rights
and a shiny trophy.
The date of Imperial’s next
appearance has not yet been
announced, so keep checking the
FiveSixEight facebook page for
details of the round three viewing
party.
