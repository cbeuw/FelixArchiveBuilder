A
s those of you who speak
to me on a regular basis
know, I went to see
Ratatat live in Brixton
the other day.I couldn’t help pouring
gloat after gloat out my face-hole.
Eat it, Josh! I was on the guest list!
Ratatat is serious business. Their
sense of groove is among the best in
the industry.Since I base my writing
on tired aphorisms, I’ll save the best
for last, for I have a few words about
the DJ who opened that night.
The lack of stage presence left me
floored. I initially thought to myself,
“Oh, they’ve turned up the house
music a bit”, before looking up and
realizing there was actually someone
on stage,spinning a feeble attempt at
dream-step-night-core-whatever-
the-hell-the-kids-are-into-these-
days. I spent the next hour and a
half cursing my punctuality, bland
noise killing my eardrums.
Okay, it wasn’t all bad – up on
the mezzanine, I could watch the
crowd.White people approximating
the act of dancing is always sort
of entertaining, in the same
schadenfreude way that watching
Russian dash-cam videos on
YouTube is oddly satisfying.
I should mention that I have no
idea who this DJ is; he managed
not to say an entire word during
his 90-minute set. What a champ.
At least he eventually got off the
they were jaw-dropping. Mike
Stroud (guitars, drums, and synths)
and Evan Mast (bass, drums, more
synth, and production) form a
two-piece that manages to pump
out some of the most righteous
grooves that my well-worn-out
ears have heard. Ratatat sounds
like an instrumental cross between
Alabama Shakes and an edgier
MGMT, with an impressive
presence – their sound has been
described as “89 guitars on stage
together”, a valid descriptor for the
wall-of-sound approach they favour.
A paradox seemed to emerge.
Two people, but a busy soundscape.
Ratatat relies heavily on pre-
recorded beats and synth rips;
usually, this would feel like cheating
to me, but Mast and Stroud have
their hands full on stage in a
constant frenzy of gnarly jams, so
I let it slide. In fact, this is possibly
the most notable feature of Ratatat–
something is always happening.
Even when they’re droning, there’s
something funny with the rhythm,
or a background synth is creeping
up the scale in a way that makes the
song sound constantly in motion.
When either runs out of things
to do on an instrument, they switch
instruments. A couple of times
during the set, Stroud would put
down his guitar and start playing
a keyboard mid-verse! During the
encore, both played a thunderous
drum duet, occasionally breaking
out for bass fills or a riff here and
there.

Stroud’s apparent love of guitar
effects added to the heaviness of
the sound, taking a sweet, syrupy
Stratocaster and running it through
reverbs, flangers, and OD pedals –
a masterclass on how to properly
use an effects board. Mix in his
technical guitar skills and you have
a very capable lead. Mast’s playing
was also noteworthy: the multi-
instrumentalist managed to rip out
some pretty slick bass runs, though
Stroud really stole the show in terms
of sonic awesomeness.
The visual side of the presentation
is reminiscent of the prog rock
days of yore – laser light carved
through the smoke in undulating
sheets, and it was super neat-o.
Plus, Mast edits videos together to
show on a projector, which are…
abstract. Abstract and sometimes
uncomfortable. Watch the music
video for their song ‘Drugs’to get an
idea of the unnerving side; the rest,
however, was impressive. A looping
video of shattering marble statues!
How much more awesome does it
get?
Overall, the show was a blast
– Stroud and Mast are intense
live in a way that can’t really be
communicated, even by listening
to the studio versions of the songs.
Next time they’re in town, dear
reader, I recommend that you
check them out for yourself.

Iglooghost’s latest EP is full on wonky
I
glooghost is the latest signing
to Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder
imprint, and the influence
he’s had on the 18-year old
producer is immediately noticeable
in his latest EP, Chinese Nü Yr.
The concept EP tells the story of a
gelatinous worm-like creature as it
travels through endless wormholes
to pink worlds consisting only of
cartoonish floating fruit.
Over four songs, Iglooghost mixes
electronic beats with futuristic hip-
hop to create distinct universes of
sound. The varying time signatures
and unusual synths place the young
producer among the best in the
Wonky genre. While the structures
of the songs might be unfamiliar,
the sounds that Iglooghost uses
borrow from a diverse range of
electronic artists. At times you can
hear echoes of Arca and Oneohtrix
Point Never.
‘Xiangjiao’(which is also the name
of the album’s protagonist) starts the
EP at a blisteringly fast 169 bpm,
with high pitched, sped up and cut
off voice samples accentuating the
speed.
In contrast, the second track of
the EP, ‘Mametchi / Usohachi’
is far slower. The plips and plops
sound eerily similar to SOPHIE’s
‘Lemonade’ (one of last year’s most
innovative songs). In a parallel
universe, Iglooghost is probably
part of the PC Music collective.
Iglooghost samples his brother
throughout the album but it’s
especially noticeable here contrasted
against the low pitched and robotic
rap verse from ‘Mr.Yote’.
‘Gold Coat’ is a slower and more
peculiar track. Its sound is probably
the most distinctive on the EP,
featuring Japanese singer/producer
Cuushe’s vocals laid over a bouncing
beat and lush synthesisers.
The final track ‘Peach Rift’is easily
the least experimental, and can be
best described as mediocre EDM
with sprinkles on top.

Purity Ring give robotic performance
T
he electronic duo from
Edmonton, Alberta
played their second
London gig this year,
touring their album another eternity
– note the lack of caps, every track
on the album is similarly stylised –
the first being at Shepherd’s Bush in
April.
Roundhouse proved to be a venue
too big for this band, as tickets
failed to sell out despite prices
being on the more affordable end
for London at £20. A cosier venue
would have been better suited to
their performance.
The stage set-up was impressive,
as it will be on the rest of the tour;
lights draped from above, creating
patterns which changed in time
with the music. Custom drum pads
created the illusion of live music,but
in reality we got nothing of the sort.
Megan James’ vocals were
unfaltering, almost robotically so.
It’s possible autotune was used for
the whole set. I had expected some
extended instrumental sections
to be used as interludes, before
building up to climaxes. Instead we
were only given replays of album

sound with no dynamics.

Chinese Nü Yr by Iglooghost is out

here because he’s not worthy of
